So he disallows Spanish in his home. He cuts off contact with her family. Mama has nothing to care about. No one to love. And so... she gets pregnant. With me.

Spanish foods and wines and treats - we would eat them so fast our stomach would swell, Javier! Always making sure we never left a trace that my father might discover.

And so... he never made a will. (then) The moment that royal fuck of a man left this earth, I became a wildly wealthy man, Javier.
