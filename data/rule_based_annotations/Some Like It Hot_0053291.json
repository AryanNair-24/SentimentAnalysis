The hearse, obviously a souped-up job, instantly picks up speed, weaves crazily through traffic, the police car in pursuit.  The hearse careens around a corner at eighty  miles an hour, the police car right on its tail. By this time the policemen are leaning out of their car w drawn guns, firing at the hearse. The two men in the rear of the hearse, flattened against sides, pull a couple of sawed-off shotguns out of a hidde overhead rack.  Police bullets smash the glass panel and  whistle through the hearse.  The driver and the man next him duck, but the hearse continues at the same breakneck  speed.  The two men in back shove their guns through the  shattered glass, fire at the police car. Despite the hail of lead, the police car - its windshield cobwebbed with bullet holes - gains on the hearse. Suddenly the car skids out of control, jumps the curb,  comes to a screeching stop.  Policemen leap out, fire aft the hearse. In the speeding hearse, the last of the police bullets th into the coffin.  Instantly three geysers of liquid spurt through the bullet holes.  As the firing recedes, the two in the back put away their guns, remove the wreath from  the coffin, take the lid off.
