The anticipated crash doesn't happen. The van rolls on smoother than ever. There must have been a road there. One that she saw but w didn't. He half-squints down the beam of the headlights, confused that he cannot see any detail out there. Just impenetrabl blackness. The road underneath the wheels sounds very different too. Smooth.
