The rainbow ferns radiate ever-increasing size and complexity. The concentric circles are endless. The sense of expansion becomes vast. Until the mesh of immense structural detail becomes - - the mesh of undulating CILIA on skin. But DR VENTRESS is gone. Where she stood, there is a shape. The ALIEN. \f118. A BEING. An uncoalescing, fracturing form. Made of light, and ice, liquid. Endless refractions. Glimpsed within these deliquescing shapes, a creature fro the world of electron microscope images. Surrounded by radiating impressions of infinitely smaller versions of itself. LENA and the BEING gaze at each other for a few hypnotic seconds. Then the BEING starts UNFOLDING again. Expanding, collaps in on itself. And this time, during the TRANSFORMATION - - we see fleeting glimpses of other bodies and faces. SHEPPARD and THORENSEN. PEYTON and MAYER. Unknown team members from the previous expeditions. For a moment it is RADEK who stands in front of LENA. Then DR VENTRESS again. Then the RADIATING SHAPES have filled the chamber.
