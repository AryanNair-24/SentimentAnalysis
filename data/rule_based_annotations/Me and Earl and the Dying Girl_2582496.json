To make the film we should have made, we should have gotten her to tell us every single thought she has ever had. Because it\u2019s all just lost, now. We should have had a camera on her, constantly, since the day she was born. Because her whole life, now, it\u2019s just lost. We should have had a camera inside her head, because all of her specific thoughts and ideas and hopes and phobias and all of her impressions of the whole stupid world, they\u2019re all about to be lost, and the film we should have made would keep her from being lost.
