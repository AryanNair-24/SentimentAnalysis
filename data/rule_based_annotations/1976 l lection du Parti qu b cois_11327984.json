Although Montreal had been a thriving city in the 1760's, it was both too poor and fire-prone to build monuments rivaling those of the French monarchs. So it waited a century.

Gilded eagles, sphinxes and winged lions (all favorites of Napoleon) peered down from their nests in the ceiling. : Once a formal bedroom, the Napoleon Room had been trans- formed into a makeshift hospital suite.
