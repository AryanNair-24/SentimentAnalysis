He goes over to the TV and crouche down to look at the VCR in the trolley underneath.  He ru his hand over its smooth surface, then suddenly leans forward to unscrew cables at the back.  This abrupt movement probably extends his life by a few minutes -- because when a hammer comes down on his head, the blow is only a glancing one. The Burglar groans and turns -- the Hider was thrown off- balance by his miss -- and the Burglar has enough time to put an arm up for protection -- the second blow shatterin his elbow.  He cries out in pain, but he's a strong man himself.  He's a match for the Hider!  He manages to grab the Hider's ankle at the same time and pull him completel off-balance -- the Hider throwing his arm out to stop himself falling, knocking to the floor the vase he bought for Julie -- landing on the floor himself as it SMASHES alongside him -- and with a great gasp the Burglar pushes the big television off the trolley onto the Hider. The Hider has the wind knocked out of him as the big TV lands heavily onto his chest, nearly squashing him like a bug.  The Burglar is already running away, clutching his broken elbow -- but the Hider's powerful arm shoots out t catch his leg, pulling the Burglar back, while with an almost superhuman effort the Hider heaves the TV off his chest. The Burglar struggles with all his might.  The two men wrestle on the living room floor.  The Burglar tries to gouge out the Hider's eyes.  Craning his face out of the reach of the Burglar's flailing, frenzied fingers, the Hider tries to get a firm grasp on him.  He grabs wildly at the Burglar's hair, finally getting a good hold.  He smashes the Burglar's head onto the glass-topped coffee table.  BANG, BANG, BANG -- the glass cracks -- BANG, BAN BANG, the Burglar's face into the glass until the glass breaks completely. The Burglar won't give up.  He's beyond pain.  He's only trying to survive.  His hand is at the Hider's throat, squeezing.  They throttle each ether.  The Burglar is on his back, his legs kicking at the Hider.  His shoe catche the Hider a kick to the ear.  They both cough and gasp as a release is forced, both struggling for a better positio the Burglar trying to slide out from under again, the Hid keeping him down -- and now the Hider is able to seize th Burglar's arm again and jam the fingers in a door jamb an pull the door back.  We don't hear the Burglar scream because the Hider's other hand is in his mouth, but the Burglar bites down so hard on it the Hider is the one who lets out a roar of animal agony and the Burglar's good ha punches at his face, the Burglar somehow on his feet agai trying to make it to the dining room. The Hider catches hold of the Burglar's shirt, tearing it but pulling the Burglar back to the floor -- and the Hider's foot slips in some blood and he lands hard on his back, hitting his head, the Burglar's torn shirt in his hand.  The Burglar is crawling on all fours to get away, but his knees slip in the blood, too, and the Hider's leg grapple him like a pair of pythons, pulling him back, and the two of them struggle on the slippery floor, out of breath, near exhaustion. There's a tall plant in the hall.  The Hider stuffs the Burglar's face in the pot, suffocating him in the soggy earth.  The Burglar's body twists and turns and kicks as he's smothered in the damp dirt, the tall plant shaking above the two of them, casting horrible shadows around th entrance hall in the moonlight cast from the skylight. The Hider can barely hold the Burglar's head in place, every muscle tensing as the Burglar's body shudders in rebellion -- and then the tremendous surge as the Burglar body breaks free!  -- Tall plant tipping as the Burglar pushes back against the Hider with unbelievable strength -- tall plant falling -- the Burglar knocking the Hider back flat on the floor, the Burglar on top, but the Hider still hugging him in a death grip, then getting a full-nelson hold on the Burglar's shoulders and neck, the two of them struggling to a standing position again, the Hider again smacking the Burglar's head again and again a again, into the front door this time, the Burglar sinking back to the floor, still resisting, still breathing, his good hand still madly feeling for a grip on the Hider, bu this time the Hider's hold is too strong and when he's go the Burglar on the floor again, he's able to get a knee into the small of the Burglar's back and with the knee as leverage and the full nelson on the Burglar's neck, the Hider pulls back with every last ounce of strength, pulling, pulling, moaning with the sheer effort of it unt -- the Burglar's neck BREAKS. The Hider rolls off, gasping for breath.  He pulls himsel to a sitting position against the front door.
