I want you to set me free.\" The song FADES OUT but Rane keeps mumbling to himself, as if he wants to say something but can't verbalize it. There is a sudden explosion +- BLOWOUT! -- and the Cadillac CAREENS madly to the right. Rane struggles frantically to maintain control of the runaway car as it charges into the desert night. Linda, bouncing about in the back seat, SCREAMS. In the middle of this nightmare ride the car RADIO starts up with a hillbilly song. The Caddy bounces across several low gullies and ridges and Linda is tossed over the front seat into the dash- board. The open bottle of J&B smashes against the dashboard beside her. \f75.

Rane wrenches the Mexican-American's arm behind his back, spins him around and, reaching around with his sharpened hook, slices open his throat. The Mexican-American gurgles a moment, then falis over. Charlie walks back to pick up his shotgun. CUT TO: CANDY'S ROOM. Johnny sits on the edge of the bed, his ears cocked: waiting, listening.

CUT TO: EXT. STAIRWAY. Carrying the Browning shotgun, Rane stealthily walks up the rear stairs. The two nickel-plated .45s in his waistband glimmer in the moonlight. Reaching the top of the stairs, Charlie peeks into the corridor. It is empty. He enters. Rane tiptoes down the carpeted corridor, listening and locking as he goes. cuT TO: CANDY'S ROOM. Candy, having removed Johnny's shirt and undershirt, unties his shoes and pulls them off. The socks follow. Listening closely, Johnny hears Charlie's footsteps comin down the hall.

Three successive blasts from Johnny's 12 gauge pump shotgun send the poker players flying in every direction. We notice a bit of T-Bird here, a bit of Melio (in orange pants) there. The bodies of a couple women join the melee. The Second Texan, SCREAMING, covered with blood and hold- ing his knife, charges toward Johnny. Another blast from the Winchester sends him spinning backwards. Rane pushes open his door and finds there an innocent American businessman cowering under the bed and a frightened whore cowering atop tt. Rane is too keyed up to stop now: he plugs them both with the .45, first the American, then the whore. Rane steps back into the corridor next to Johnny. There is the SOUND of running feet from the end of the cor- ridor. Charlie turns and fires, Candy's bloody body rolls down the carpet. There is a sharp RETORT from the opposite end of the corridor. Charlie grimaces. Blood spreads from a bullet wound in his side. Johnny wheels around and sees Big Ed standing behind Charlie with a smoking .38 in his hand. Big Ed is wearing his unbuttoned lime green Western shirt with the rhinestone wagon wheels on it. Two blasts from Johnny's shotgun send Big Ed bouncing on his butt down the hail. Johnny throws down the shotgun and pulls his .45, \f110. One door remains unopened on the second floor. Johnny and Charlie approach it with their .45s drawn at arm's length. Two young half-naked Mexicans, one of them Big Ed's chauffeur, burst out of the room firing their revolvers. They are cut down in the crossfire of .45 slugs. Johnny eatches a surface wound in his right forearm. Johnny ducks down, crossing in front of the opening at th top of the stairs. A bullet flies past his head as he runs. He notices several Mexican thugs standing at the foot of the stairs out of the corner of his eyes. They have drawn guns. There is no immediate danger. Johnny and Charlie rest a moment, looking at each other across the bannister opening. It 1s possible for them to retreat out the back stairs, but they do not. Charlie drops his .45 and pulls a freshly loaded one from his waist. His shirt is soaked with blood. Johnny discharges the spent clip from his .45 and inserts a fresh one from his pocket. They look at each other a moment, deciding what to do. Charlie yells to Johnny in Vietnamese: Chung ta di di!

Trying to speak, he gurgles blood and dies. Though Charlie's killer is already dead, Johnny plugs him again. And again. There are no more men at the foot of the stairs. Only bloody bodies, scared whores and a discarded guitar. The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS up the stairs from Charlie's dead body to Johnny still standing at the top of the stairs. He stands bareback in bare feet, his belt hanging loose. Blood covers his right breast and left forearm. Con- torted bodies lie on the floor behind him. There is a .45 in his hand. He is SCREAMING at the top of his lungs. His gun is empty but Johnny cannot stop firing it. His finger manickly pulls the trigger: CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK. The image FREEZE FRAME. SOUND abruptly HALTS. Johnny is caught mid-trigger pull, his mouth frozen open in a never-ending scream, Keyed~up, ready to go. A force in motion, unable to stop. Pure energy.
