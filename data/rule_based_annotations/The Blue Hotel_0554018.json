HOLD THIS DARKNESS perhaps eight seconds Then, within a  maximum thirty seconds, the darkness alters through the l of pre-dawn, dawn, etc., to the light of late morning. At the proper early juncture, one or two small lights appear windows, and go out again. At the edge of the town, in th earliest real daylight, a man's tiny figure comes out of door and walks out of r.s. Little flags of smoke and stea sprout, compact and crisp, in the bitter air. Shading and detail become increasingly clear. The station is coal-bla its sign FORT ROMPER, is just readable. The town is mostl low, mean, frame construction -- the drab shades of tired blotting-paper. The Hotel, of a disturbing shade even in  darkness, gives off under the changing light an always mo and more sinister and unearthly fish-belly glare. Its sig PALACE HOTEL, is newish, and easy to read. It is a crummy rather frail-looking wooden building of two stories, crow by florid cornice work. Beyond these buildings we can see perhaps forty miles. Th sky is dull gray; the snow is like rice; there are farms, lonely distances apart. When high, shadowless morning light is established, the t silhouette of a man -- SCULLY -- walks briskly out of the Hotel front door and towards the station. o.s., begin and bring up SOUNDS of an overworked locomotive and a train; walks faster; bring up the SOUNDS; he trots; a somewhat  archaic locomotive, crusted and bearded with ice and snow slowing, drags on from l.s. a baggage car, a daycoach, th first of a string of boxcars; covering SCULLY as he trots stopping. As quickly as will not be be absurd, SCULLY  reappears, walking towards the Hotel, followed by the COW the EASTERNER, the SWEDE, in single file. At the same mom the CAMERA, which is centered on the hotel door, starts  towards the door at their pace, holding them within left- screen. We get at first only character by silhouette and  near-silhouette, then in more detail. SCULLY is in the lead, half-turning as he walks, to talk; short, chunky, late middle-aged. Next, the COWBOY, size a structure of John Wayne, tight city trousers, a solid blo of mackinaw, his best hat; he walks like a horseman and w the stooping, rather diffident stride of a man of his hei he carries a scarred raw-hide suitcase or a splotched Hol hide roll-grip. Next, the EASTERNER. He is small, slender bears himself well and entirely without the bumptiousness so many small men. Without at all mincing, he is more nea footed along the icy boards than the others are; he carri a briefcase and a middle-sized, neutral valise, possibly  with faded labels on it. Last, the SWEDE: He is above ave height but stocky enough to seem shorter than he is, and  disturbed and scared enough, as a rule, to sag an inch or two more. A shiny black leather coat to the middle of the thighs, trousers which look as if he had on two suits of  long underwear beneath them, a cap of coarse hairy wool, sizes too small, high on his head, with earflaps which at best cannot thoroughly cover his ears. There is something shaky, equivocal and arythmic about his walking. An outsi new suitcase which looks to be covered by black oilcloth  increases his clumsiness at the knees. As these men grow out of silhouette into detail and size, and we begin to hear their SOUNDS, the CHOWF-CHOWFINGS of the locomotive, o.s., drown out these SOUNDS and the  locomotive and the train, gathering speed, cut off the me from view and then fill most of the screen, the Hotel sti jutting above.

Though violence is of itself shocking, the chief shock or sensat element is getting the shock of two essential amateurs, n fighters, in something close to mortal combat: almost as  disconcerting as if one saw a couple of clergymen trying beat each others' brains out. This can be arrived at thro the ice, heavy clothes, ungainliness and lack of skill. I is also clear that you can kill a man whether you know ho or not. Both soon learn that in such heavy clothing  practically all that's worth trying to hit is the head; t Johnnie, assuming that the Swede is soft in the middle, t pumping them into his belly with hard loud smacks of fist against leather. The fight is not shot in detail or from  either fighter's angle, but as the spectators see it -- n very clearly. SOUNDS of blows and breathings are way up.  Insofar as possible, the best fight would come of ad libb it, barring a few junctures necessary to the story. The two men crash together like bullocks and there is a  perplexity of flying arms. We so exaggerate the SOUND of crash that the audience feels it like a kick in the belly and instead of any sparring or fooling around they instan start socking with all their speed and strength. Both are evidently trying for instant and pulverizing victory; als it is very thoroughly a hatred-fight. They work with this intensity as long as their first wind and strength holds. They veer side to side and back and forth enough in this  first phase that the CAMERA has to waver back and fill a  little, but nothing special -- except that it should not  frame them too carefully or neatly.

The line of the boardwa is marked by a little line of naked, gasping trees. In th deep distance, when blowing snow allows, we see the small single, stinging light of the station. The Swede is about halfway between the hotel and the edge town, coming toward us floundering, struggling into the e of the wind, with terrifying spirit and energy -- carryin his big valise and now and then clutching his cap almost  like Harry Langdon. Within a few seconds (see note below method) he comes a full hundred yards. CAMERA shoots him shoulder height, a little upward toward his face. As he g nearer an ordinary CLOSE UP the CAMERA PULLS BACK. For a  moment he just wags his head a little, fast, almost  paretically, looking all around; growing in his face is a hunger for enormity, violence, bragging, love, glory,  something, anything so long as it is huge enough to meet half-way. Suddenly he opens his mouth and yells at the to of his lungs -- then stands, like an idling locomotive,  breathing quiet and fast through clenched teeth. Then his hands begin to move; fists hitting the air. Becoming awar of the suitcase, heavy in his right hand, he mingles grin and weeping and moaning and hits it as hard as he can wit his left fist, and drops it and kicks it twice, three tim as hard as he can. It isn't enough for his desperation an joy; again he scans the darkness; and suddenly, with his  right fist, he hits himself as hard as he able on the joi of the jaw. He reels a little with the blow and whispers  something, and stoops and picks up his valise (CAMERA adj to these violences). As he straightens and starts down th street into the middle of the town, he is smiling with a  strange peacefulness and hope and sweetness -- a tired Pi on the homestretch to Paradise. The CAMERA PANS as he passes closer, and centers on him a he plods down the middle of the snow-foundered, lightless street. (A NOTE ON THIS SHOT): It is to be heightened above reali during the Swede's advance up the boardwalk. When he is s in the deepest distance, we use only every third frame; t every second; then cut every third frame; then every four meanwhile slurring the CAMERA speed a little, fewer frame per second, so that his speed of approach is at all time  superhuman and grotesque, but becomes smoother as he  approaches. By the time his features become distinct no f are skipped but the motion, though regular, is fast and d rather than silky; it is at this time and pace that the t is run through.
