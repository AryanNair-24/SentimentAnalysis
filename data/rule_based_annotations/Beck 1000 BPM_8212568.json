Tic'Tic stands his ground. He goes closer to the lead bul and thrusts his spear at the animal's face. THE MAMMOTH CHARGES. Tic'Tic ROLLS out of the way, barely avoiding being trampled. Tic'Tic BLOWS HIS HUNTING WHISTLE. At that signal, D'Leh and the other hunters leap to their feet, waving their arms and SHOUTING. The rest of the herd, spooked and furious, SNORTS, TRUMPE some rearing up on their hind legs. \f11. The herd charges after the lead bull with a sound like rolling thunder. Their stampede leads them into a valley. Far in the dista we make out a rock formation, a wide opening, which we la learn will lead into an increasingly narrow canyon. Tic'Tic joins the other hunters, running, giving them han signals, deploying them.

Tic'Tic sees D'Leh and CALLS OUT angrily to him, motionin him back with the group, but the thunderous sounds of the mMammoths\u2019 stampede drowns out Tic'Tic\u2019s voice. Ka'ren looks angrily ahead at D\u2019Leh. Moha and Lu'Kibu see D'Leh ahead of the group, and exchange an angry look. Picking up speed, D\u2019Leh gets further ahead of the other hunters. D'Leh is now running ahead of some of the trailing mammot and some of those animals veer to the outside of D\u2019Leh, driving him in among the main herd. Tic'Tic sees this happen. His anger grows, but there\u2019s nothing he can do about it. We _ see big boulders looming ahead. With D'Leh running among them, two of the mammoths in the center of the herd are spooked and start to veer off, awa from the mouth of the canyon. Other mammoths in the herd respond, and start to veer awa from the canyon mouth as well. Tic'Tic sees the herd starting to change direction becaus D'Leh. Tic'Tic motions to Ka'ren, Moha, and Lu\u2019Kibu, who tighten up on their side of the herd, yelling, driving th herd back toward the canyon mouth. The lead bull has passed the boulders, and now every anim has to choose its route. \f12. D'Leh runs between two massive animals who want to squeez between two of the giant stone boulders.
