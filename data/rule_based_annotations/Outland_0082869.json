Standing on Ganymede...you have to look almost directly upwards to see Jupiter's polar cap. : The red spot swirls near the middle...like a giant furious sore. Bands of colors stretch dcross the surface...and bleed into one another. ..giving warning of the violence that is occurring on the surface. You see this terrible, gaseous warfare going on... and there is no noise. You know that there are sounds down there that you don't ever want to hear. Most of all, however, it is the sheer size of Jupiter. It looms so enormous in the sky...that you can feel its gravity. You sometimes are afraid to jump from Ganymede's surface...afraid that you will be sucked into Jupiter's pull...and be drawn closer and closer...and then you will hear what it really sounds like...and then you will be swallowed. That is a fairly common phenomenon on Ganymede. It is quite similar to the kind of disorientation skin divers can experience. Most of the workers lose their sense of up and down for a while...simply because of the constant sight of Jupiter in the sky... making them feel that they are going to fall inward, rather than down. They soon get over it. The mine scales the sheer wall of the crater. The platform glistens in the harsh half light from the low sun. It contains a series of angular structures. They are connected by what look like plastic vacuum hoses...which are passageways. The sunlight is almost always from the horizon... causing elongated shadows. It kicks up brilliant pin spots of white glare on the platform. There is an overwhelming quality of impermanence to these structures. The effect is almost like Dodge City in the 1870's...this small temporary settlement of ugly buildings...broiling in the sunlight, and freezing in the shadow. . - The scaffolding is orange oxidized metal...and it stretches more than 200 feet down the inside wall of the crater.

The mining equipment is all oversized. Gargantuan yellow cranes on thick treads, crawl around the rin. Pumps and generators pulsate in a web of intake and outflow pipes that stretch from the crater to the storage silos. It all looks like it was made by Matell. The workers wear color-coded environment suits. The workers in the crater wear yellow. Equipment drivers wear red. Maintenance personnel wear blue. Manage- ment wear white. The suits are equipped with oxygen tanks and heating units. Everyone has their name stenciled on the left breast pocket. All of the workers in the crater have safety tethers... stretching from the scaffolding. Since there is one- sixth gravity...men can float from one level to another by a slight push. The only sounds we hear are the constant crackling of static...and sporadic dialogue...heard through the intercom systems. We are on the ninth level of the scaffold. A line of men are using electric arcs to cut into the rock. The ninth level is in shadow...so the men are in the hot pool of yellow work light.

He can hear himself breathe in the quiet, Places that are normally noisy take on a nervous quiet when they are unoccupied.

It is marked with the company logo...and the words: \"REFRIGERATED/PERISHABLES\". cur TO: INT. CONTAINER 119. O'Niel strafes the inside of the huge container with his flashlight. His warm breath forms puffs of smoke in the freezing air. His collar is pulled up and buttoned at the top. Sides .of beef hang from large hooks...the meat a shiny red under the pale layer of fat. The rigid line of beef sides runs the entire length of the container. O'Niel begins to walk down the line of carcasses. The light dances off the protruding ribs...and the blue stamp marks on the fat layer. A garrotte wire slams over o'Niels head before he knows what has happened. His hands instinctively go up to his throat...trying to claw for breath. Yario's massive arms are gripping the wire tighter and tighter. His knee is in O'Niel's back...forcing him to arch backwards. Yario's knee lifts O'Niel off the ground. O'Niel's eyes are bulging with fear and pain. He is making rasping noises...while he tries to writhe away from Yario's grip. He flails his arms and legs.... desperately trying to strike Yario. Slowly,..0'Niel's motions become weaker. The veins in his neck are bulging. His arms stop swinging. His legs cease kicking. His chest stops moving. He crumples. Yario drops O'Nielsts body on the floor of the container, He walks down to the end of the container. The various sides of beef are marke@ for their destinations, Some are marked: \"CAPETERIA\"...others are marked: \"WARD ROOM \f119. 120. 77. Continued. 119. MESS\", There is one side of beef that is stamped: \"GENERAL MANAGER\". Yario goes over to it...and starts to turn it around. O'Niel's leap brings him slamming into Yario's rib cage...crashing him against the container wall. The force of the impact momentarily knocks the wind out of Yario. O'Niel puts bota hands together...and drives them into the bridge of Yario's nose. Blood begins spurting as soon as the bone has been broken. Yario rises like a wounded bear. O'Niel drives his head into Yario's solar plexus. The air goes out of his huge body with an enormous whoosh. Yario doubles over. O'Niel puts all of his weight into swinging his knee up into Yario's descending chin. The impact is a dreadful deep thud. Yario is a quiet mound of unconscious muscle and bones on the floor. O'Niel leans against the wall for support...as he tries to catch his breath. He reaches up with his left arm...and unbuttons his collar. We see that he has been wearing a rigid protective collar of plastic. He takes the collar off...and throws it on the ground. O'Niel looks over at the side of beef with \"GENERAL MANAGER\" stamped on it. He walks to it. He starts turning it around slowly. He shines his flashlight inside the hollow...inspecting the grey ribs. Nothing seems out of the ordinary. He reaches in his pocket and takes out a small knife. He makes a thin slice in the fat layer.

The ridge of the panel is too thin. Ballard loses his balance. \fASVLISW we ew ewwe 123. Continued. 245, Both men tumble over the side...and float past the sparking panel. Their struggle is lit by the fuming mass of orange in the sky. They claw at the air... trying to find something to grab on to, and trying to avoid contact with the panel. O'Niel manages to grab onto the struts under the first row of collector panels, and above the second row. [It stops his fall. Ballard grabs the same strut. They both grapple and climb onto the narrow strut. Their images flicker in the blue sparks, and are rim~ lit by the orange from Jupiter in the black sky. The wound in O'Niel's shoulder is beginning to take its toll. He can't hold on with both arms. Ballard leaps at O'Niel...,and starts to pry his one hand from the strut. O'Niel doesn't have the strength to keep holding on, He takes his free hand and reaches around for the valve leading from Ballard's air tank. Ballard has almost succeeded in prying O'Niel's hand from the strut...when O'Niel closes the valve, Ballard draws a breath, and starts to choke. He involuntarily lets go of O'Niel...to reach for his air valve. O'Niel makes one last kick with both legs at the chest of Ballard, both of whose hands are on his back. It is enough to send him down and sideways, Ballard's right boot strikes the surface of the collector panel. There is a blue-white eruption of sparks, Ballard's body goes rigid with the jolt. He strikes the panel again. Another shower of terrible light. He tumbles slowly downward...skipping off the panel...shimmering with the electricity that is surging through him, He falls free...hundreds of feet downward. He is not moving. His stiff body almost disappears in the - distance...when it lands on the transformers, The buz~ zing of the electricity as it devours him is a harsh flare, on the distant bottom of the platform. O'Niel drapes his arms over the strut. He tries to catch his breath...looking down at the transformers. He leans his head against the strut...and closes his eyes. cur TO: \fAoE"}, {"head_type": "heading", "head_text": {"terior": null, "location": null, "shot type": null, "subj": "247,", "ToD": null}, "text": ""}, {"head_type": "heading", "head_text": {"terior": null, "location": null, "shot type": null, "subj": "RMEVESCA 1445.05", "ToD": null}, "text": ""}, {"head_type": "heading", "head_text": {"terior": null, "location": null, "shot type": null, "subj": "124,", "ToD": null}, "text": ""}], [{"head_type": "heading", "head_text": {"terior": "INT.", "location": ["LEISURE CLUB 246."], "shot type": null, "subj": null, "ToD": null}, "text": "Lazarus enters the room.
