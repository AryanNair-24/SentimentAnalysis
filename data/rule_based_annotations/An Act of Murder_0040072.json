She uses her napkin daintily against her lips and looks up.  Out of the gloom back of her comes a tall, thin blond young man dressed in a neat business suit and carrying a tan hat in his hand.  He leans forward and kisses the old woman.  After he straightens from the kiss, she pats his arm affectionately and they speak together for a few seconds but their words cannot be heard because of the great distance.  Then he bends to peck at her cheek again, turns and disappears into the darkness at the other end of the room. FULL SHOT - MacIlwain.  He takes his glance from the window, rummages through his pocket for a cigarette, then for matches, all the while watching the door of the house opposite.  Just as that door opens, he strikes the match and brings his cupped hands, shielding the flame, before his face. LONG SHOT - The doorway from MacIlwain's angle.
