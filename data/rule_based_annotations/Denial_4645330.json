The history of the matter is quite the reverse. The defendant did make serious charges. But, as it turns out from the evidence, the accusations are true in every significant respect. RAMPTON shares a look with DEBORAH before continuing. He really wants her to hear this. RAMPTON (CONT\u2019D) The Holocaust took place in stages. The first stage, beginning in 1941, consisted of mass shootings carried out by specially formed SS groups and their local allies. DEBORAH closes her eyes. There is a moment as the faces o multitude of people are shown on the walls of the court, if the ghosts of the dead were present. \fFull Blue Script // December 4th 2015 98. RAMPTON (CONT\u2019D) This resulted in the deaths of up to 1.5 million Jews living in Russia and the Baltic States. The second stage, which began in December 1941, consisted of the gassing of Jews of the Warthegau and Poland. This resulted in the deaths of probably as many as 2.6 million. The third stage, beginning with mass deportations in 1941, culminated in the gassing, mostly at Auschwitz, of Jews from Central, Western and Southern Europe. This stage lasted until late 1944. At this point RAMPTON looks to DEBORAH then turns and loo up to the gallery where VERA and the other SURVIVORS are sitting. He addresses them. RAMPTON (CONT\u2019D) The total achievement of this systematic mass murder was probably between five and six million innocent souls. RAMPTON bows imperceptibly to VERA who stares back, moved The multitude disappears. DEBORAH watches, not breathing. RAMPTON (CONT\u2019D) It is wildly implausible therefore to present Adolf Hitler as a somewhat harried business executive, too preoccupied to know what was happening in the branch offices in Treblinka and Auschwitz. During this trial we have heard from Professor Evans and others of at least twenty five major falsifications of history. Well, says Mr Irving, all historians make mistakes. But there is a difference between negligence, which is random in its effect and a deliberateness which is far more one-sided. All Mr Irving's little fictions, all his tweaks of the evidence, all tend in the same direction: exculpation of Adolf Hitler. It is, to use an analogy, like a waiter who always gives the wrong change. If the waiter is honest, then we may expect his mistakes sometimes to benefit the customer, sometimes himself. But Mr Irving is the dishonest waiter. Every one of his mistakes works in his own favour. \fFull Blue Script // December 4th 2015 99. For once at the trial DEBORAH smiles. RAMPTON (CONT\u2019D) How far, if at all, Mr Irving's anti-Semitism is a cause of his Hitler apology, or vice versa, is unimportant. Whether they are taken together or individually it is clear they have led him to prostitute his reputation as a serious historian for the sake of a bogus rehabilitation of Hitler, and the dissemination of virulent anti- Semitic propaganda.
