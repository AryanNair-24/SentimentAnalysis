A slight scratching sound at the door. She starts to panic, the scratching gets louder. She hears a whimpering. It\u2019s the dog. She springs out of bed and opens the door, relieved.

The scratching starts up again, only this time it can\u2019t be the dog. Amelia stares at the door unable to move. The door clicks and moves open by itself. Amelia watches, her heart in her throat. The rustling, scratching sound moves inside the room. Amelia slips the covers over her head, terrified. She can\u2019t see anything now. The sound appears to be moving closer. After an age, Amelia pulls down the duvet, unable to stand it anymore. She peers into the terrible darkness. Something large and black lurks in one corner on the ceiling. She can\u2019t make out what it is. Time stops. The shadow scuttles quickly across the ceiling. It stops right above her head. Amelia is paralyzed by fear. She hears a rasping sound. The thing appears to be breathing. Her hand reaches for the bedside lamp. Her eyes are fixed on the dreaded shadow right above her head. Before she can get there, the thing drops down right on top of her. She sees its hideous, mask like face millimetres from her own; the black eyes, the mouth wrenched open in a permanent, silent scream. She takes a huge breath, as if breathing the thing in, terrorized. Amelia switches on the lamp, springs out of bed and turns on the overhead light. Bugsy barks. Samuel wakes.
