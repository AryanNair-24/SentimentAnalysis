The gray sky contains a soft glow from the recent sun, so tha trees and long blades of grass seem to shimmer in the gathering night. There is a rasp of crickets, and the rustle of leaves in an occasional whispering breeze. Transitions are easy and gradual, with relaxed studies of earth, grass and leafy branches on a high-mounded hill. Revelation of cemetery markers does nothing to disrupt th peacefulness of our established mood; when awareness come it is almost as though we have known where we were all along. We are in a typical rural cemetery, conceivably adjacent to a small church Although the presence of a church is felt rather than confirmed. The stones range from small identifying slates to monuments of careful design..an occasional Franciscan Crucifix, or a carved image of a defending angel. Over a hundred years of death indicated in stones syllabic with their year and the status of the families they represent. Over the other night sounds is added the gravel-rumble of slow-moving car. A wider shot reveals the car and the mounded cemetery, as the car pulls into the gate and move down one of the cemetery roads, the car passes in extreme foreground and moves away from the camera. In the breeze of its passing, the dead leaves that clutter the little road swirl and move. Beyond the distant trees, the last receding gray of dusk surrendering to the black. The car continues. When the ca stops, we feel the absence of its sounds..replaced by the crickets and the subtle wind. Even as the car is still rocking slightly form its stopping action, we cut to a sh through the driver window at the occupants of the car. Th DRIVER is a young man in his mid-twenties, and his PASSENGER is a young woman, his sister. The man is in shirtsleeves with a loosened tie. His suit-coat is on the clothing hook over the back seat. The girl is wearing a simple but attractive summer suit, with the jacket remove and folded on her lap. She is fussing with her purse, while the man shuts off engine, lights, and leans back to yawn and stretch his legs. The girl closes a potato chip bag, brushes crumbs, fluffs her hair ... typical feminine gestures after a long ride.

He appears almost crippled. \f10. In a flailing run, Barbara reaches the car, sobbing. She yanks open the door. She can hear the man drawing nearer. She scrambles into the front seat and slams the door shut ... No key. The man draws nearer, seeming to move faster, more desperate to reach the girl. Barbara sobs she clenches the steering wheel. The driver\u2019s window is open, she struggles to roll it up ... then pushes the loc button. The man is upon the car. Barbara dives across the seat to slam down the passenger-side lock button.

Barbara\u2019s screams become more violent. She summons enough presence of mind to reach for the emergency brake. The man pounds and flails at the window.

The road ahead is black ... the speed is frightening ... she pulls the light switch ... The headlights dance beams of light among the trees. The beam reveal the grade in the road, which is narrowing to one c width, and, about two hundred feet ahead, the downhill grade ends and an uphill grade begins. In desperation, th girl looks out the rear window. Against the sky, in the light from the cemetery gate, the man is still coming aft them. In panic, she looks about. She is still in the cemetery proper. Rows of graves on both sides of the road. No lights from houses, no signs of life. The car slows. It\u2019s momentum carries it some distance up the upgrade. Barbara glances backwards ... the man is moving faster toward her ... she is terrified... the car reaches full stop. There is increased panic in her face ... as she forgets herself and the car begins to drift backward ... toward the man, as he draws nearer. The car picks up momentum, carrying her toward her pursuer. \f11. She grabs at the emergency brake and yanks it tight, the lurch of the car throwing her against the seat. She struggles with the door handle; the button pops up ... th man draws nearer ... she breaks from the car. The man keeps coming, desperately trying to move faster . Barbara runs, off the roadway and onto the turf of the cemetery. She falls ... kicks her shoes off ... gets up and keeps running. The man is still after her. She reache a low stone wall which marks the end of the cemetery. She struggles over it and looks ahead for a moment to get her bearings. Across a main highway is a darkened gasoline station, and beyond it an old house. She pants heavily, glancing up and down the highway ... but there is no sigh of traffic. The man is nearing the low cemetery wall. She breaks into a run across the highway. The gasoline station shows no signs of life. It is old an decrepit. One light is out over the pumps. The pump house and surroundings are nearly lost in shadow. Some fifty yards away, there is the old house. She runs toward it. She presses against the side of the house, in a darkened corner, trying to look up into the window. Across the highway, she sees her pursuer struggle over the little wall, and in his clumsiness fall groveling on the ground. In panic, she runs to the rear of the house and into the shadows of a small back porch. Her first impulse is to cr out for help, but she silences herself in favor of trying to stay hidden. She gasps, trying to hold her breath. Silence ... night sounds ... and the sounds of the man\u2019s funning footsteps slowing to a trot ... then a walk ... t footsteps stop. Barbara quickly glances about. There is a rear window. Sh peers through it, but inside everything is dark. The pursuing footsteps take up again. She presses back agains the door of the house, and her hand falls on the doorknob She looks down at it, grabs it with a turn, and the door opens. She enters quickly, as quietly as possible, and closes the door softly behind her, bolting it and feeling in the darkness for a key. Her hand finds a skeleton key, and she turns it, making a small rasp and click. She lean against the door, listening, and can still hear the dista footfalls. \f12. Barbara finds that she is in the kitchen of the old house She gropes through a door and into a large living room no sign of life. Her impulse is to cry for help, but agai she stops herself for fear of being heard by the man outside. She darts back to the kitchen, rummages through drawers in a kitchen cabinet, and finds the silverware. She chooses a large steak knife and, grasping it tightly, goes to listen at the door again. All is quiet. She goes back into the living room. Beyond it is an alcove that contains the front entrance t the house. She rushes to the front door and makes sure it is locked. Cautiously, she pushes back a corner of the curtain to see outside. The view overlooks an expansive lawn, large shadowy pine trees, and the service station across the road. There is no sign of the attacker. Suddenly, there is nois from outside: the pounding and rattling of a door. Barbar drops the curtain edge and stiffens. More sounds. She hurries to a side window. Across the lawn, the man is pounding at the door to the garage. She watches, her eyes wide with fear. The man struggles with the door, then looks about and picks up something and smashes at it. In panic, Barbara pulls away from the window. Across the room is a telephone.

It is a different figure, a different man. She runs to the door and peers out through the curtains again. The man still walks toward the house. A shadow darkens a strip of window at the left of the door. Its abruptness startles her. She peels back a corne of the curtain and sees the back of the first attacker no ten feet away, facing the man who is approaching. The attacker moves toward the new man. Barbara freezes agains the door, and glances down at her knife ... she looks bac out at the two men. They join each other under the dark, hanging trees, and stand looking back toward the cemetery. From inside the house, Barbara squints, trying to see. Finally, the attacker moves back across the road, in the direction of the cemetery. The other man approaches the house, seeks the shadows of a tree, and stops ... in an attitude of stolid watching ... Barbara stares, but can see little. She lunges toward the phone again ... dials the operator ... the same recorded message. She barely stops herself from slamming down the receiver. Then suddenly a distant sound ... an approaching car. She scampers to the window and looks out. The road seems empty. But after a moment a faint light appears, bouncing and rapidly approaching ... a car coming up the road. Barbara reaches for the doorknob, edges the door open ver slightly. The light spills dimly over the area. There, under the great tree in the lawn, is the silhouette of th second man.

Stay tuned to this wave length The big man waves his hand in disgust at the repetition o the radio and moves away as it continues it\u2019s announcement. He resumes his efforts with the heavy woode tabletop. This time he drags it to the living-room window. He leans it against the wall and pulls back the curtain to peer outside. There are now four figures standing in the yard. The voice of the distant radio recording continues. The figures stand very still, their arms dangling, aspects of their silhouettes revealing tattered clothing or shaggy hair. They are cold, dead things. Something in the distance suddenly startles the truck-driver. From across the road, a figure is moving toward the house The man spins himself away from the door and rushes to th fireplace. He reaches for his matches. In the little stand near the couch, where Barbara lies unconscious, the are old magazines. The man grabs them, rips pages loose, and crumples them into the fireplace. He piles kindling wood and larger logs, then touches the paper with a light match and a small fire takes hold. \f35. There is charcoal-light on the mantle. He sprays the glowing fire and it whooshes into a larger blaze, almost singeing the big man\u2019s face as he works. The larger logs begin to burn. He returns to the window. The recorded message repeats itself continuously. The man hoists the table-top to the window-sill, and braces it there while h places a nail in position. He pounds with the jack- handle ... driven by desperation ... another nail ... and another. With the table secure, he checks it hastily and leaps to another window, where he can peer out between it nailed-up boards. The new figure is just reaching the place where the other stand silently. The man rushes to the fire, where the biggest logs have now begun to blaze. He seizes the discarded table legs and saturates them with charcoal- light, then holds their largest ends into the fire until has two good flaming torches. Then, a torch in each hand, he moves toward the door again. He nudges a big padded armchair ahead of him to the door and, taking both torche in one hand, pulls the curtain aside for another look at the yard. The figures still stand silently. With charcoal-light, he drenches the padded armchair and touches it with a torch. It catches instantly, and flames lick and climb, casting flickering light throughout the house. The heat on the man is severe, but he has to fight it. He lunges for the door, unbolting it, and flinging it wide open. From the yard, as the door bangs open, the flaming chair is visible. It throws eerie, irregular illumination onto the lawn. The waiting figures step back slightly. The man shoves the chair through the doorway, it slides across the front porch. It topples over the edge, and the flaming bulk tumbles down the steps onto the front lawn. In the rolling motion, flames lick and fly, and small particles of the chair\u2019s stuffing leap and glow in the night wind. The bonfire rages in the tall grass. The waiting figures back further away. Inside the house, the front door bands shut, and the man fastens the bolt. He hurries again to the window, puts more nails into the table-top, fastening it securely, the surveys his surroundings, seeking out possible vulnerability. (The camera moves with him seeing the task that lies ahead. ) \f36. There is a side window in the living room, a window in th dining room at the other side of the house, the front doo and the flanking glass panels. He turns, still inspecting and his eyes reflect surprise. The girl is sitting up on the couch. Her demeanor is startling. (As we cut to her) Her face is bruised, and she sits in silence staring at t floor. The radio drones on. The fire plays on her face, and reflects in her eyes. The man takes off his jacket an moves toward her. He fixes his jacket over her shoulders and looks sympathetically into her face. She just stares at the floor. The man feels dumb and helpless. Forlornly, he moves to the pile of lumber, chooses a table-board, an goes to the side window. The radio voice continues The truck-driver boards up the two side windows, then mov to the front door. He gets an ironing board, and places i across the door horizontally. It extends over the flankin glass panels leaving cracks at the top and bottom, but th are to small for anything to get through. He drives nails through the board into the molding and tests the barricad for strength. Finding it sufficient, he leaves it and goe on to the next. In the dining-room there are two closed doors. He tries one, finds it locked, examines it and finds no latch. It has been apparently locked with a skeleton key. The other door is locked and leads into a den, which contains several windows. The man is disappointed at the added vulnerability. He thinks for a moment, then leaves the room, shutting the door behind him. It is clear that he has decided to board up the door rather than try to secure the bay windows. \f37. He checks his remaining lumber. The supply is dwindling, but he selects the best piece for boarding the den door. He is about to start hammering when an idea strikes him. He opens the door again and enters the room. There are chairs, a desk, a bureau... he steps to the desk and starts to rummage through the drawers. He pulls out paper a stack of pencils and pens, a compass, a hundred little odds and ends. Another drawer ... A hundred more things ... he leaves it open. The bureau contains mostly clothing, he rips out the big drawers and hurls them through the doorway and into the dining area. One drawer ... two... their contents spilling onto the floor ... he looks back at the bureau ... a final idea hits him. He shoves the great piece of furniture through the door, walking it through the tight opening until it clears the doorway. Then the desk, which warrants another struggle, as the man attempts to secure all things of possible value before he finally nails the door shut. In the closet, there is a lot of old clothing; the man finds good warm coat and jacket and flings them over his shoulder. High on the shelves are piles of old boxes, suitcases, hatboxes, and old umbrella. He looks for an instant, debating their worth, or the possible worth of what they might contain. At his feet, he sees still more clutter, boxes, umbrellas, dust, shoes and slippers. He picks up a pair of ladies\u2019 flats, and examines them, thinking of the barefoot girl out on the couch, and tucks them under his arm. As he pulls away, something catches his eye ... within th dark recess of the closet, something shiny, the sheen of finished piece of wood, a familiar shape, lying under a pile of dirty clothing. He reaches eagerly, and his hand finds what he had hoped, a rifle. He sets everything down and rummages even more eagerly all over the floor of the closet through shoe boxes, under things, items come flyin out of the closet. A shoebox contains old letters and postcards. But, in a cigar box, clattering around with pipe cleaners and cleaning fluid, there is a maintenance manual and a box of ammunition. He flips open the box and finds it half full. He shoves manual and cartridges into his pocket, then decides to take the whole cigar box full of material. He tucks it under his arm, gathers jackets and shoes, and leaves the room. In the dining room, he drops the load of supplies on the bureau, and the sight of the girl in the living room stop him short. She is sitting as before, not moving. \f38."}, {"head_type": "heading", "head_text": {"terior": null, "location": null, "shot type": null, "subj": "TRUCKDRIVER", "ToD": null}, "text": "We're all right now... this place is good and solid.
