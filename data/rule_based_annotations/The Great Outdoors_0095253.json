They escaped the metal boxes that they lived in and went off into the woods and slaughtered and ate this family before they were recaptured. Now, that story gave me nightmares not to be believed and I don't want Uncle Chec's bear story to upset you in the same way. So I'm here to say there isn't a bear like that, none of what Uncle Chet said actually happened and that even if there were a bear out there, I'm in the house prepared to protect you.
