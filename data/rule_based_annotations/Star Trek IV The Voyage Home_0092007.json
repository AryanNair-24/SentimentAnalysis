Earth is under the attack of an unidentified orbiting probe which emits transmissions on an energy wave unknown to us. This powerful wave, directed at our oceans, has almost totally ionized our atmosphere. All power sources have failed or been neutralized. All Earth orbiting Starships are powerless. A cloud envelope has enshrouded the planet causing heavy rain and flooding. Temperatures are dropping to critical levels. This planet cannot survive unless the Probe is responded to. The Probe's transmissions dominate all standard channels. Further communications may not be possible and we have discovered no methods to repel the Probe or destroy it. Do not attempt confrontation with the Probe!! Save your energy, save yourselves. Avoid the Planet Earth at all costs. Farewell...
