Everything is in the execution. There is nothing vague in it. It is all common sense. Theory does not enter into it. The simplest moves are always the best. \f38. When the French skirmishers finally reveal a chink in the enemy position, it becomes a focal point for the main eff Horse artillery are sent forward, on the gallop, to open with canister at close range. The main attacking force of infantry are then sent forwar moving up in columns and lines. The cavalry trots beside them, in the gaps, to make their presence felt where it will be best used. Drummers and bands fill the air with stirring music. Officers march smartly alongside their men. The precision of these attacking maneuvers is very import because the sight of the slow moving, perfectly aligned m of infantry is more frightening and discouraging to the defender than a wild bayonet charge. When the two main forces are about 100 yards apart, the Commanding Officer in the field starts the chant \"Hymn to Victory\" and places his hat, with its large tricolored cockade, on the point of his sword so that is can be seen all of his troops. When the distance narrows to about 50 yards, the defendin Austrians fire their first volleys -- first row, second r third row. The French fall everywhere, but the remainder fill in the formation and keep moving in regular step. This is the crucial point of the battle. The defenders no have to decide whether they are going to run or face the attackers' volley and subsequent bayonet charge. There is time for the defenders to reload. Now the French are 20 yards away and still hold their fir trained to do this because their psychological advantage lost once they have discharged their muskets. They want t defenders to break and run. Now panic has begun to set in and to dislodge the defendi Austrian troops. They start to give way. The French relentlessly move forward. The Austrian movements at the rear become a stampede. The officers signal with their swords, and the drummers b the charge. The sky rings with a thousand battle cries. \f39. The cavalry dashes forward and hacks down the fleeing Austrian infantry, who are virtually helpless against the cavalry out in the open. The French have won the day, and their infantry fires the first volley at the backs of the fleeing Austrian troops."}], [{"head_type": "heading", "head_text": {"terior": "EXT.", "location": ["MILAN STREET"], "shot type": null, "subj": null, "ToD": "DAY"}, "text": "The triumphal entrance of the French army into Milan.
