But, after that night, things were never the same, Each holiday now knew the other one's name. And so when their long isolation had ended, They cautiously reached out, and slowly befriended. And each shared a bit of the things that they had With each other, and found out it wasn't so bad -- They had snowflakes in Halloween, those we could spare, And we here in Christmas enjoyed a few scares. The fireworks gave the Easter Bunnies a thrill And St. Patrick's Day cherishes Easter Eggs still. And though that one Christmas, things got out of hand, I'm still rather fond of that skeleton man. Though misguided I think his intentions were good. He was just a poor skeleton misunderstood. So many years later I thought I'd drop in, And there was old Jack, still looking quite thin. With four or five skeleton children at hand Playing strange little tunes in their xylophone band. And I asked old Jack, 'Do you remember the night, When the sky was so dark, and the moon shone so bright? 'When a million small children pretending to sleep Nearly didn't have Christmas at all, so to speak? 'And would, if you could, turn that mighty clock back To that long fateful night?  Now, think carefully, Jack. 'Would you do the whole thing all over again? Knowing what you know now, knowing what you knew then?' And he smiled like the old Pumpkin King that I knew, Then turned, and asked softly of me...
