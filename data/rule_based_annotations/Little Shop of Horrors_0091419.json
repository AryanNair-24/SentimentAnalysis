The screenplay and lyrics were written by Howard Ashman and the music composed by Alan Menken, who collab- orated on the off-Broadway and Londen stage hit on which the movie is based. The stage hit, which has since blossomed into a perennial, was inspired by Roger Corman's \"Grade 2\" horro film of the same title. Shot in 1960 on an unbelievable schedule of two days and a night (largely because Corman offered a storefront left over from another movie), \"Litt Shop of Horrors\" went on to become a cult classic. It was also notable for the brief, bizarre appearance of relative newcomer Jack Nicholson as a masochistic dent patient. New York theatre critics gave the stage production of \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors\" a blue ribbon reception. The New Yorker's Edith Oliver hailed it as \"a musical comedy that is both musical and comic... full of surprises and marvel effects.\" Richard Corliss in Time magazine welcomed \"a carnivore with its own intimidating charm\" which \"envelop the stage and (gasp!) most of the audience.\" Winning the Drama Critics' Circle, Drama Desk and Outer Critics' Circle Awards as the season's best musical the show spawned an American touring company (which is st going strong), a two-year London run, and productions in France, Scandinavia, Israel, Japan, Germany, Australia an ~more- \f\"LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\" ~ Production Information -3- Iceland. With the acquisition of the screen rights by the David Geffen Company, the voracious Venus people~trap had blossomed thrice. Geffen's goal was to fuse the elements of the original story and the show into its own unique entity. The time-frame, he decided, would remain intact. Downtown, it is still 1960. Here, Seymour Krelborn (RICK MORANIS) toils slavishly for Mushnik (VINCENT GARDENIA), who plucked him \"as a tyke\" from the Skid Row Home for Homeless Boys. In his basement bedroom, where he raises exotic foliage, Seymour pines for Audrey (ELLEN GREENE), the lithe, blonde salesgirl with the Betty Boop voice and cinema noir wardrobe. But Audrey is literally a prisoner of love. Her steady crush--in more ways than one--is Orin Scrivello (STEVE MARTIN), a biker dentist whose delight for burning rubber is only exceeded by his joy for inflicting pain. When he isn't giving root canals a bad name or getting hi on his own nitrous oxide, Scrivello spends most of his ti putting Audrey in traction. One night, in the depths of Mushnik's cellar, Seymour pricks his finger on a rose~-and Audrey II gets her first slurp of RH negative. Audrey II grows. Seymour grows anemic. Audrey II demands more \"sticky, licky sweets.\" Seymour buys more Band-Aids. If Mushnik's prosperity and his exhausted -more- \f\"LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\" - Production Information -4- errand boy are both to survive, fresh blood must be added to the floral food chain... For director Frank Oz, the challenge of \"Little Shop of Horrors\" was \"deceptive.\" The project, he says, \u201clooke simple, but wasn't. If we played it too camp, the audienc wouldn't care about the characters. If we were too straig we'd veer toward melodrama.\" What evolved was what Oz calls \"heightened reality.\" In opening the stage show to encompass the littered alley decrepit tenements and end-of-the-line elevated train of Mushnik's neighborhood, he and Oscar-winning production d signer Roy Walker created a fantasy Skid Row. But within the sprawling set--which consumed every square inch of Pinewood Studios' \"007\" stage (the largest in the world)- also sought a certain \"intimacy.\" \"I didn't want to balloon it into a musical \u2018War and \u201d Peace' or even a big, splashy '40s extravaganza,\" says th director. \"There are no dizzying overhead crane shots. No irrelevant dance numbers. Nothing to overwhelm what is basically the simple story of a boy, a girl and a man-eat plant.\" Several production numbers, however, display amusing affection for film lore. The hollow-eyed vagrants, shuffl through the gutters of \"Downtown,\" recall Busby Berkeley' Depression-era classic, \"My Forgotten Man.\" \"Somewhere That's Green\" is a paean to the suburban never-never land scores of movies and \u201860s sitcoms. -more- \f\"LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\" - Production Information -5- Within the \u201cheightened reality,\" Oz and Geffen gathered a colorfully incongruous cast. Seymour is played by Rick Moranis, one of the Canadian ' who Second City troupe's non-fraternal \"McKenzie Brothers,' breezed through \"Ghostbusters\" as Sigourney Weaver's rand next-door nebbish. His \"Little Shop...\" role as a botanic body snatcher required \"more straight acting than anythin I'd done before,\" says Moranis. \"But the real attraction the chance to sing. Until now, I'd been limited mostly to parody.\" Ellen Greene, on the other hand, knew the role of Audrey \"Like a second skin,\" having played it for two yea in New York, Los Angeles and London. (Time magazine prais her portrayal of \"a sweet, sexy, slightly dizzy blonde wi an Elmer Fudd lisp, wittle-girl wiles\" and a voice that \u201cbuckles theatre walls.\") Her character, comments Greene, first came into focus during costume fittings for the off-Broadway show. \"We we through about five wigs before Audrey became a cornsilk blonde,\" she explains. Next came the low-cut leopard skin dresses, stiletto heels and jangling of the B-movie heroi who were Audrey's role models. Vincent Gardenia insists that he was chosen as Mushnik because \"Frank Oz liked my name.\u201d The Naples-born actor, who began his career as a teenager playing old men in New Yor Italian theatre, calls Mushnik \"a symphony of frustration He's a man trying to cling to the past despite the deprav ~more- \f\"LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\" - Production Information -6- building around him.\" At the root of much of that depravity is Steve Martin's Doctor Scrivello.

With the trio assembled, there was still one character left to be cast: Audrey II.

An acknowledged animatronics wizard, Conway has worked with Oz (and Jim Henson) on \"The Muppet Show\" and \"The Da Crystal,\" and had designed the enchanting Lewis Carroll character for Dennis Potter's \"Dream Child.\u201d Conway began the project with an \"inspirational\" field trip to London's famous botanical Eden, Kew Gardens. \"I f that at each stage of her development, Audrey II should h a distinct look.

Then she grows... and grows more monstrous.\" Conway next turned to the Atomic Energy Authority at Harwell, England, for technical advice on creating a core which would support... and control... the creature. \"The scientists there saw it as a game, a pleasant break from their top-security work. They were immensely helpful,\" he says. \"Size,\" continues Conway \"is the downfall of most mechanical marvels, Small creatures are relatively easy. Big ones suffer from gravity. Our challenge was to take something twelve and a half feet tall, weighing slightly ~more- \f\u201cLITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\" - Production Information -8- more than one ton, and make it rap and boogie with a life of its own.\" One aspect which concerned director Oz was Audrey II's lip synching. \"It had to be perfect,\" says Conway. \"Frank didn't want big, flapping hamburger buns.\" To get the rig effect took as many as forty puppeteers. By the time Conway's work was finished, he'd gone through 15,000 hand-made leaves, 2,000 feer of vine, seve hundred gallons of KY Jelly and 11 1/2 miles of cable. (\"Just slightly more cable than was used to build the Brooklyn Bridge,\" he says proudly.) But Audrey II was only half-alive. Still to come was the character's voice, performed by Levi Stubbs, an original member of the Four Tops. Says musical director Robby Merkin: \"If I die tomorrow, workin with Levi will get me into heaven. Here's a modest, con- summate pro who has been singing for thirty years in a group that changed the face of popular music. \"He can sing anything, any way you ask him. We showed him what the plant would look like and a light bulb went in his head. From then on, he was the plant.\" Combining the film's diverse elements into a hothouse of horrors began long before a camera turned. The first phase of the process was in the hands of production desig Roy Walker, an Academy Award winner for \"Barry Lyndon,\" a nominee for \"Yentl,\" and a subject of critical acclaim fo his work with Roland Joffe on \"The Killing Fields.\" -more- \f\"LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\" - Production Information -9- The \"Little Shop of Horrors'' storyboards were the work of Mike Ploog, who graduated from Marvel Comics (where he drew \"Conan,\" \"The Werewolf\" and \"Planet of the Apes\"... \u201canything with hair on it\") to films like \"Superman II\" a \"Young Sherlock Holmes.\" In creating his imaginary Skid Row, complete with \"working\" elevated train, Walker remained a stickler for detail. Set decorator Tessa Davies was dispatched to New York, on a scavenger hunt to find gas meters, soap boxes, doorknobs, street signs and hundreds of stage props, circ 1960. The oddest item on Davies' shopping list were garbage cans from that era--complete with authentic garbage. ''Th had to be genuine and they had to be old,\" she says. \"T went around the streets in a truck loaded with new garbag cans, offering to trade them for used ones. People though I was crazy. I suspect I got away with it only because I was a foreigner.\u201d Simultaneously, costume designer Marit Allen was rum- maging through thrift shops, with the same sixties flavor mind. \"What helped was that the principals all had a defi idea of how they should dress,\" she says. Ellen Greene wanted \"clothes that suggested cast-offs from Kim Novak and Rita Hayworth. We agreed that there wo be a point in the story where her image would change. Whe she falls in love with Seymour, she goes from red, black leopard to softer shades.\" ~more- \f\u201cLITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\" - Production Information -10- Rick Moranis' wardrobe was designed to \"help Seymour bridge the credibility gap, somewhere between a nerdy los and a shy, appealing guy.\" Steve Martin was \"discreet in taste in black leather... more Elvis Presley than Hell's Angels.\" Within the complex interweaving of humor, music, fantasy, horticulture, set design, special effects, chore raphy, puppetry and the ultimate threat to civilization, core of the movie is its characters, says Oz. \"They have be people you believe in... people you laugh with, not at About the Cast... As Seymour Krelborn, a fledgling Faust on Skid Row, RICK MORANIS moves downtown from the Central Park penthou he occupied in \"Ghostbusters.\" In that #1 comedy hit of 1 he was the party animal who threw wild bacchanals across hall from Sigourney Weaver, unaware that her Mid-Manhatta apartment was being repossessed--by dead spirits. Playing New Yorkers of any stripe is no greater sur- prise to Toronto-born Moranis than the fact that he is an actor at all. \"I always thought show business was for Americans,\" he says with his trademark sly grin. \"I didn' realize Canadians could get involved.\u201d In fact, he began his career as a radio engineer while he was still in high school. Although it was only part-ti it offered Moranis an unlooked-for opportunity: after con sistently writing funny one-liners for his deejay friends -more~ \f\"LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\" - Production Information -11l- he was given his own show, and soon became a popular on-a personality. Seguing into cabaret comedy, Moranis performed in Toronto nightclubs, then moved into Canadian television. After several years of writing and performing, he was ask to join \"Second City Television\" in its third season. Whe the satirical comedy show was picked up by an American ne work, it not only won an Emmy but also brought Moranis national recognition. In solo spots on \"SCTV,\" Moranis earned special acclaim for his comedic portrayals of such personalities as Woody Allen and Dick Cavett, and won Emmys for comedy writing in 1981 and '82. With Dave Thomas he created the McKenzie Brothers (Bob and Doug)--beer-guzzling philosophers from the Canad north woods, whose goofy antics became an \"SCTV\" mainstay When the \"McKenzie Brothers\" made an album, it won a Grammy nomination. When they made their screen bow, it was as the stars, co-writers and co-directors of \"Strange Brew\"--the top-grossing Canadian film of 1983. Moranis has since appeared in \"Streets of Fire\" and \"Club Paradise,\" as well as \"Ghostbusters.\" Even though she wanted Audrey to \"be ripe enough to fall off a tree,\" ELLEN GREENE insists there is something \u201cplayful and kittenish about her... she's a child/woman y fall in love with because of her imperfections.\" -more- \f\"LITILE SHOP OF HORRORS\" - Production Information -12- That Greene knows her character inside out is to be expected. She played Audrey for two years on stage--18 months in Los Angeles and off-Broadway, and six months in London's West End. A native New Yorker, whose grandfather was in the Yiddish theatre, she always knew she wanted to be a per- former. Although her father was a dentist, one brother a doctor and the other a lawyer, her education-oriented family didn't stand in her way when she started calling on casting agents after finishing high school. She finally landed a gig at Reno Sweeney's, a cabaret club on 13th Street, where she played piano, sang and ban tered... and earned strong enough reviews to move up to off-Broadway. With the New York Shakespeare Festival, Greene appeared in David Rabe's \"In the Boom Boom Room,\" \"Sorrows of Step \u201cWake Up, It's Time to Go To Bed\" and \"Stage Directions.\" She made her Broadway bow in the title role of \"Rachel Lily Rosenbloom and Don't You Ever Forget It!\" then appea in \"The Nature and Purpose of the Universe,\" \"Teeth and Smiles\" and opposite Michael York in \"The Little Prince a the Aviator,\u201d Her performance as Jenny in \"Threepenny Opera\u201d brought her a Tony nomination. After making her motion picture debut in Paul Mazursky's \"Next Stop, Greenwich Village,\" Greene played Jill Claybu friend in \"I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can.\" \"Little Shop of -more- \f\u201cLITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\" - Production Information -13- Horrors\" marks her third film. When Mr. Mushnik, the flower shop owner, gives Audrey some fatherly advice--\"A date gives you a corsage, not a multiple fracture\"--he is simply acting in character. Acc ing to VINCENT GARDENIA, who portrays him, Mushnik is \"a of Old World manners, trying to cope with the craziness a cruelty around him.\" A veteran character actor in films, theatre and tele- vision, Gardenia was born in Naples, Italy, in 1922, and played his first role at the age of five--in Brooklyn, wh his family settled after emigrating. Graduating from juvenile to leading roles in New York's Italian theatre, the growing Gardenia was in his mid-30s when he began his professional career in earnest. His bre through came with off-Broadway's \"The Man With the Golden the 1954 shocker about drug addiction. After enhancing his reputation with \"The Brothers Karamazov,\"' \"The Visit,\" \"Death of a Salesman\" and \"A Vi From the Bridge,\" Gardenia won the coveted Tony for his performance in Neil Simon's bittersweet \"The Prisoner of Second Avenue.\" He followed up with roles in three more Simon plays--\"God's Favorite\" (written especially for him \"Plaza Suite\" and \"California Suite.\" He most recently ap peared on Broadway in the 1984-85 hit, \"Glengarry Glen Ro Interestingly enough, Gardenia, who emanates an easy Italian warmth, has alternated between softies and cold- blooded killers in his screen career. He made his bow in -more- \f\u201cLITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\" - Production Information -14- \"Cop Hater\" in 1958, appeared in \"Murder Inc\" and played mobster Dutch Schultz in \"Mad Dog Coll.\" But he won his Oscar nomination for his crusty, kindly baseball team manager in 1973's \"Bang the Drum Slowly.\" Other films include \"Death Wish,\" \"The Front Page\u201d with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, and \"Heaven Can Wait with Warren Beatty. His close-cropped hair is hidden under a black wig that recalls the glory that was \"Grease,\" his sunshine smile is twisted into a sadistic leer, and he handles women like Cagney on a bad day. But as Orin Scrivello, D.D.S. (Doctor of De Sade), STEVE MARTIN has a role he can sink his teeth into. One of the outstanding comics of the past 15 years, Martin has won Emmys for his television work, Grammys for his record albums, and an Oscar nomination for his screen bow as \"The Absent Minded Waiter,\" a 1978 short film. Born in Waco, Texas, he was raised in Southern California, where he sold Disneyland guidebooks at 10, and did magic and comedy routines at Knott's Berry Farm in his teens. After earning his degree in Theatre Arts from UCLA, Martin, then 21, entered television as a writer on the popular \"Smothers Brothers Show\" (his first Emmy). He soon added such clients as Sonny and Cher, Pat Paulsen, Glen Campbell and John Denver to his list, but by the late 1960s began performing his own material. -more- \f\u201cLITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\" - Production Information -15- After serving as the opening act for musical groups like the Carpenters and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Marti hit his stride through frequent appearances on Johnny Carson's \u201cTonight Show,\" and other TV guest shots. Expressions like \"Excuuuuuuse me\" and \"I'm a wild and cra guy\" became part of the language. Martin's career soon encompassed his own television specials, sold-out concerts and gold-plated comedy albums His first two--\"Let's Get Small\" and \u201cWild and Crazy Guy\" won Grammys, while \"Comedy is Not Pretty\" and \"King Tut\" sold in the millions. With \"The Jerk,\" which he co-wrote, Martin moved into feature films in 1979. He has since starred in the innova tive \"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid,\" the sci-fi spoof \"The M With Two Brains,\" the provocative \u2018Pennies From Heaven,\" as Lily Tomlin's haunted other half in \"All of Me.\" Martin wears three hats on the soon-to-be-released \"Three Amigos,\" including that of executive producer. Di- rected by John Landis, \"Three Amigos\" was written by Mart Lorne Michaels and Randy Newman. Additionally, he topline the cast along with Chevy Chase and Martin Short. Martin is presently shooting \"Roxanne,\" a screenplay he wrote for Columbia Pictures. Directed by Fred Schepisi and produced by Daniel Melnick and Michael Rachmil, Marti stars with Daryl Hannah, Rick Rossovich, Shelley Duvall a Fred Willard.

All are native New Yorkers, who knew each other either from school or from appearing in such musicals as \"Sing Mahalia Sing,\" \"The Me Nobody Knows\" and \"Mama, I want to Sing.\" Michelle, who plays Ronette--at 18 the oldest and \u201ccoughest\" of the three--began singing at four and acting at 14, She completed a run in the starring role of Emma i \"The Tap Dance Kid\" just before filming \"Little Shop of Horrors.\" Sixteen-year-old Tichina--whose Crystal is the youngest and \"most talkative\"--is a student at New York's Music an Art High School.

At 5 she won a car in a talent show, and has sinc appeared in various musical shows, including \"Mama, I Wan To Sing\" and \"Really Rosie.\" She is a student at Arts Hig in New Jersey. Short but sparkling contributions to \"Little Shop of Horrors\" are made by John Candy, James Belushi and Christ Guest. As radio announcer Weird Wink Wilkenson, JOHN CANDY -more- \f\u201cLITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\" - Production Information -17- puts his considerable heft through quick character change relying on voice and sound effects to fool his listeners, It's child's play for the Toronto-born Candy, who first gained recognition in television's \"SCTV,\" where he impersonated (with devastating precision) such out~-sized stars as Orson Welles, Divine and Luciano Pavarotti. He also won two Emmys for his writing contributions. Candy made his film debut as an extra in \"Class of '44,\" but quickly found his metier in such hugely success comedies as \"The Blues Brothers,\" \"Stripes,\" \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" and \"Splash.\" He has since co-starred in \u201cBrewster's Millions,\" \"Volunteers\" and the recently released \"Armed and Dangerous.\" Portraying a high-powered entrepreneur--who plots to get his cut from Audrey II's cuttings--is JAMES BELUSHI, rently winning wide acclaim as Bernie Litko in \"About Las Night.\" (The character, a crudely endearing sexist, was originally performed by Belushi in David Mamet's \"Sexual Perversity in Chicago,\" the Obie-winning play on which \u201cAbout Last Night'' is based.) Born and raised in Chicago, Belushi graduated from the University of Illinois and spent two years with the city's fertile Second City troupe before signing on as th Pirate King in Joseph Papp's touring production of \"The Pirates of Penzance.\" Following the show to Broadway, Belushi remained in New York for a two-year stint on television's \"Saturday ~more=- \f\u201cLITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\" - Production Information -18- Night Live,\" then returned to his hometown for \"Sexual Perversity.\"\u201d After making his film debut in \"Thief,\" he played a cameo in \"Trading Places,\" starred in \"The Man With One Red Shoe,\" and co-starred as a rock 'n' roll deejay in \"Salvador.\" CHRISTOPHER GUEST--the customer who gets rose fever from Audrey II--is a native New Yorker who studied clarin at the High School of Music and Art, then began his caree as a National Lampoon satirist.

As an actor, he appeared in brief but telling roles in \"The Blues Brothers,\" \"Trading Places\" and \"An America Werewolf in London\" before making an overnight folk-hero- and Time cover-boy--of Yoda, the wrinkled, lovable Jedi sage in \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" As a filmmaker, Oz served as producer (with David Lazer) on the Muppets' second movie, \u201cThe Great Muppet Caper,\" co-directed \"The Dark Crystal\" with Jim Henson, then made his solo directing bow with \"The Muppets Take Manhattan.\" Producer DAVID GEFFEN, an entertainment entrepreneur whose involvements range from records and films to Broadw shows and talent management, began his career in 1964 in mail room of the William Morris talent agency. Four years later, with agency co-worker Elliot Roberts, he formed Geffen-Roberts Management which shortly represented such clients as Joni Mitchell, Crosby, Stills and Nash, Neil Young and Jackson Browne. In 1971, Geffen formed his own label, Asylum Records. He later merged the company with Elektra to form Elektra/ Asylum, which soon became a recognized leader in the musi industry, with such artists as The Eagles, Linda Ronstadt Jackson Browne, Queen, Carly Simon and Bob Dylan, among others. In 1975, Geffen was named Vice Chairman of Warner -more- \f\"LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\" - Production Information -20- Bros.' film division, a post in which he was responsible for the successful pictures \"Oh, God!,\" \"The Late Show\" and \"Greased Lightning.\" From 1976 through 1979, Geffen taught a course on the music business at UCLA and Yale University, and, in 1980, was appointed by Governor Brown to the Board of Regents of the University of California. In 1980, he returned full-force to the music industry with the formation of his own Geffen Records, with such t talents as John Lennon/Yoko Ono, Donna Summer, Elton John and Peter Gabriel on the label. The \u201880s also marked Geffen's entrance into theatrical productions, such as the smash hit \"Dreamgirls,\" the Tony Award winning New York production \"Cats,\" and the Dramati Guild-winning \"Little Shop of Horrors.\" His other notable theatrical efforts included \"Master Harold and the Boys\" and the Royal Shakespeare Company's \"Good.\" The '80s also brought Geffen's renewed involvement with motion pictures with formation of The Geffen Film Company.

When composer ALAN MENKEN won the 1982/83 Outer Critics' Circle Award for his music in the stage version of \"Littl Shop of Horrors,\" it was the result, he says, of a longst ing friendship and collaboration with Howard Ashman. The pair previously teamed on \"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater,\" 1979 musical of Kurt Vonnegut's book, which marked Menken first major production.
