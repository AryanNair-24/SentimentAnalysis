Colorful tents stand under frozen trees, pennants snapping in the icy wind.  A small army of elves, imps, goblins, gnomes and faeries has gathered, all decked out in various odd bits of armor recovered from the dragon's lair.  Groups of these tiny folk are engaged in martial training, practicing with swords, lances and bows. As we MOVE through the camp amid this mock mayhem, certai isolated incidents attract our attention: Two goblins duel furiously, sweating and panting under th weight of their ill-matched armor.  They are clearly exhausted.  As the other elves continue slashing at one another, these two take time out; one leaning against a tree trunk while the other folds his arms in repose.  But their swords CONTINUE to duel, alone in mid-air, the blades crashing together MAGICALLY like iron birds. Another group practices archery, aiming their tiny arrows at a straw scarecrow some distance away.  They are extremely accurate, puncturing the dummy in a dozen vital spots.  When the last arrow strikes, instead of retrievin them, the faeries stand their ground.  One-by-one, the arrows PULL FREE from the scarecrow and FLY back unaided through the air to land safely in their owner's quivers. Two huge knights, each over seven feet, slug it out in full armor with battle axes.  They bash away at one- another, until a fearsome blow literally cuts one in half The upper portion of the bisected knight topples to the ground with a LOUD CLANG.  The two armored legs remain erect, swaying slightly like trees in the wind.  Suddenly a tiny head appears above the left cuisse.  It is an elf. He is LAUGHING.  Another elf pops his head out of the right-hand cuisse and the two \"legs\" hop off in opposite directions. The fallen armor also comes apart:  one gnome in the breastplate; another lifting the helm from the gorget.
