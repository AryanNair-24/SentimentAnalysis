Everything seems really far away. That\u0432\u0402\u2122s the past. The girl looking in the telescope is moved. He\u0432\u0402\u2122s too fa in the inverted lens, so she can\u0432\u0402\u2122t see that the boy she always fighting with is moved as well. They\u0432\u0402\u2122re all at a loss for words. Mick crouches over a knapsack and pulls out a bottle of spumante and some plastic cups, talking all the while. MICK BOYLE (CONT\u0432\u0402\u2122D) When I was young, I used to say to myself: if I grow old I\u0432\u0402\u2122m not going to make the same mistake all old people make, I\u0432\u0402\u2122m not going to become boring and pedantic. But that\u0432\u0402\u2122s exactly what I have become. So, forgive me. Now for the serious stuff: Brenda can\u0432\u0402\u2122t wait to get started. And I am so proud of having written this screenplay with you. I have to confess something. I\u0432\u0402\u2122ve made twenty films, but they\u0432\u0402\u2122re all irrelevant. This is the only film that means anything to me. This film has... yes, well, it\u0432\u0402\u2122s my sentimental, intellectual, and moral testament. This film is the only thing that matters to me. Nothing else. And so, let\u0432\u0402\u2122s toast to the completion of the third draft of \u0432\u0402\u045aLife\u0432\u0402\u2122s Last Day.\u0432\u0402\u045c"}, {"head_type": "heading", "head_text": {"terior": null, "location": null, "shot type": null, "subj": "SCREENWRITER 1", "ToD": null}, "text": "What about the ending, Mick?"}, {"head_type": "heading", "head_text": {"terior": null, "location": null, "shot type": null, "subj": "MICK BOYLE", "ToD": null}, "text": "The ending...

He fixes his eyes on the road, but is not for long: Palom now appears on the front windshield. \f73. Slowly, she slithers down the windshield onto the hood. Pressing her body against the glass, she winks at him, ma eyes at him, shows him her tongue and everything else as rolls onto the hood, the car still tearing along at 120mp the wind in her hair. With an acrobatic move, Paloma finally climbs through the window again and is back in the car. She sits next to Julian. He wants to touch her, but she c prevents him, increasing his desire.
