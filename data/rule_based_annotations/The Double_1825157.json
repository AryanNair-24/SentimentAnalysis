On her walls we see several more pictures that Hannah has drawn of James. There appear to be about a dozen of them. Simon sighs. Suddenly she seems to hear a noise. Tentatively, she pads over to the door. She tries to listen to something that i happening outside. She opens the door but there is no one there. Simon pans back up to James\u2019s window, just in time to see him tip toe in with MELANIE, they\u2019re giggling. They shut the door and start kissing. James keeps motioning for her to be quiet. Melanie goes over to the window and starts to draw the blinds, but James stops her, making\u2019sure they\u2019re open. As he\u2019s kissing Melanie, he seems to glance over to Simon window, deliberately putting on a show. Simon covers his mouth with disbelief. He can\u2019t watch. He thinks to himself, muttering.
