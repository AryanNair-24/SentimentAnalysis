When we can see again, Sean and a corner of the stern are gone. For a moment, Sean is seen holding onto the piece of dock piling with his remaining arm.  He cries out for help but it's lost in the swelling sound of the Christmas Carol coming from the dock.  Then Sean and the pole disappear beneath the surface.  He's just gone.
