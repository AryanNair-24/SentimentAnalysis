She was like a child come home, Everything about the city excited her: she had to walk all the hills, explore the edge of the ocean, see all the old houses and wander the old streets; and when she came upon something unchanged, something that was as it had been, her delight was so strong so fiercely possessive} These things were hers, And yet she had never been here before, She had been born and raised in the East, I liked: it \u2018at first, of course, I love this : place; I wanted my bride to love it. But then it began to make me uneasy. Her delight wastoo strong; her excite- ment was too intense, it. never faded; her laugh was too loud, her eyes sparkled too brightly; there was some- thing feverish about the way she embraced the city. She possessed it. And then one day she changed again... and a great sigh settled on her, and the cloud came into her eyes.... Now Gavin Elster has signed the check, and he and bis wife rise and start for the door, Scottie still cannot get an unobstructed view of her face, but we can see in flashes that she is young, in her twenties, with a mobile, attractive face and gentle eyes that have warmth and intelligence and humor. Scottie is intent on her, At the doorway to. the bar, only two feet from him, she stops end waits as her hueband peuses behind her to speak to the headwaiter and him and tip him. She looks about calmly, with sure, distant repose, Her eyes come to rest on Scottie for a moment, then move on with the small smile. During all of the above, Elster's voice has gone on, without pause, and his narration ends as the girl, Madeleine, comes to a stop near Scottie and waits. (Continued) \f- im FROM AMONG THE DEAD 19.
