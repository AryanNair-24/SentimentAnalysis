It forms a sort of rude pergola In the center of this structure is a small, cubicle hut, of rough boards but neatly whitewashed.  From the rafters the main structure hang crude chandeliers of tin which gi light to the ceremonies. (Please see pages 28 to 31, Life Magazine, December 13, 1 All the details mentioned above are graphically illustrat Near the little hut in the center of the Houmfort, stands altar covered with a lace tablecloth and littered with a childish jumble of plates, candles, little colored stones bottles.  Before this altar stands the Houngan, the high priest of the voodoo ceremonies, a small, stoop-shouldere man in a worn, white coat and trousers with ragged cuffs. Several mild-looking negroes in white trousers and shirts in kitchen chairs on one side of the altar with rada drum between their knees.  Grouped around this altar in a loos semicircle are the worshippers, a group of mild-mannered, poorly-but-neatly-dressed negroes.  They seem to have mad effort to dress in their best and their best is very poor indeed.    As Betsy approaches, she can see familiar face As she comes up they turn and look at her.  They are not hostile nor greatly surprised; just mildly curious.  Lead Jessica by the hand, Betsy takes her place at one end of semicircle around the altar.  Her arrival has in no way interrupted the ceremonies.  The Houngan continues to cha before the altar, the rada drums beat and the crowd sings chorus of the Shango song at the proper intervals.  It is very decorous and decidedly religious in tone.  No sooner Betsy taken her place with the others than the Shango rit approaches its climax.  The Sabreur, a colored man dresse white shirt and trousers, with a neat dark tie knotted un his collar, comes in, bearing a sabre in his right hand, holding it in stately, almost processional manner.  He advances to the altar, strikes it three times and at this signal two colored women dressed in white beguine dresses with square cut necks, an essential part of this religiou costume, come forward.  One holds a white leghorn chicken the other carries a white rooster. They come together to altar and for a moment, the figures of the Houngan, the Sabreur and the two Mam-Lois hide the actual blood sacrif from us.  Only the fact that the drumming and the singing reach a climactic pitch reveal that some Important portio the ceremony has taken place.  Instantly the drumming and singing stops.
