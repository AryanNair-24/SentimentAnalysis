Then John walks into view, taking Caroline in his arms. H holds her tight, letting her comfort him. Caroline kisses away troubles, not asking their source. He puts his hands her rounded belly. Harriet bends over her knees and vomits. She takes the satchel from her shoulder and slings it hard against the door.
