Colwyn stares at him for a moment, then unsheathes his sword, grips it with both hands, and swings it at the sto wall. The blade strikes the stone with a spine-shivering clang. He swings again - another clang. But on his third swing, the blade bites into the rock, sinking to a depth several inches. On the next swing, the blade penetrates deep into the roc and on the next, it slices all the way through, tearing loose chunks of stone. Colwyn swings the sword back and forth like a scythe, cutting his way through the solid ro spraying fragments behind him. In the other passage, Lyssa presses herself against the wall, watching the Beast's eyes come closer. Suddenly, a chuck of rock bursts out of the wall near her as Colwyn c through.
