This seems too much for her, she rests her forehead again the clear plastic and lets out a low moan. Suddenly, Eva is at her side.

She looks at the bottle, it\u2019s down to the halfway mark. Fuck it, fills her glass. Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there? Eva, fuzzy...puts her hand out to grip the bannister. The is no bannister. A door at the end of the hall the opposite end to Eva's, room we haven\u2019t seen before, a pause, she pushes the door open. Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again? A small, cell like bedroom; a neatly made, single bed. No much else, sparse and impersonal. She places the little box on a bare shelf, beside the onl book, \u2018ROBIN HOOD\u2019. Tell me dear are you.... She smooths down the bed covers, stands in the doorway fo moment. Lonesome tonight? Eva turns off the light leaving the empty room... waiting FADE TO BLACK. You know someone said that the world's a stage, and each must play a part... \f143.
