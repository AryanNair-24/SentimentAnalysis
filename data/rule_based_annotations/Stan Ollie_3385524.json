A few moments then LAUREL, aware of the MAN stand on his shoulder, turns to look at him. At the same time t MAN turns to LAUREL and gives him a polite smile. LAUREL to smile back but realises the MAN is tremendously boss-e his eyes literally looking in opposite directions. LAUREL double takes. The MAN politely raises his hat, then walks away.
