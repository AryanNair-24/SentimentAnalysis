Suddenly, it darts in at her and she jabs the spear at it (into the audience), causing it to veer away. Kathryn seems surprised by this.  The shark begins to circle her again, CAMERA PANNING with her as she keeps an eye on it.  Philip and Ike keep filming, Mike keeps watching tensely on the deck as Kathryn positions herself, holding the spear extended, moving it back and forth. Abruptly, the shark darts in, moving so precipitously that it goes all the way to Kathryn.  She ducks and the shark's jaws clamp shut on her air tanks.  Philip reacts to this and starts forward to help her as the shark begins to shake her violently from side to side. Letting go of the spear, she tries to hit the shark in the eye but has no success.  Philip shows up, and she waves him off.  He cannot believe her reaction but doesn't draw his powerhead, only hitting the shark on the head with the camera.  This makes it let go of Kathryn's tanks and back off fast.  Philip shoving it aside as it passes him, drawing his powerhead just to be safe.  The shark does not attack him though, but retreats.  Philip looks at Kathryn.  She is shaken up, but the chain-mail suit has protected her from injury. She waves him back irritably.  Shaking his head either at her or her stupidity, he backs off to Ike, keeping a wary eye on the shark as Kathryn kicks up to the surface to get another spear.  On deck, Mike tries to speak to her as she grabs the spear, but she is under again before he can say a word.  Kathryn grimly sets herself again.  Seeing this, Philip casts his eyes heavenward, as though thinking, \"Dear God, the woman's suicidal.\"  She jabs the spear toward the still lingering shark.
