Suddenly, like j replacing sadness and brooding, light breaks forth, and t universe is born Molecular clouds gather to make galaxies, which sail out through the void like ships on a sea without shores. New stars, new worlds are born and pass away, like wasted see They are the furnaces in which the elements of our future life are smelted. Many experiments must be tried and reje before our system is hit upon; much labor expended, with continual improvements through the long ages. At last the ancestral earth appears; a bulb of gases, mor like a star than a planet, seared by the sun's fire, glow like a coal from deep within. The gases cool to liquid. A solid core falls out; a thin crust forms. From time to time the vapors clear away to reveal a mighty inferno of magma and pitch. \f14. The sky fills with steam. Rains fall for millennia, cooli the surface by degrees. For ages there. is no clear day o sun, no night of stars; only thunder and lightning. But b and by the mists drift off, the clouds part and the first land appears, a low island of meteoritic rubble and stark volcanic stone. With no plants to hold the land in place, wind and water carve the stone into fantastic shapes. Shadows move mathematically over the hills. The vast wastes wait for nothing. Each day is like the last. In the boiling waters of a hot spring, entities develop t can maintain their integrity in thefage of disturbance fr without. They do not endure by maintaining their rigidity They are soft and yielding. They resist change by themsel changing endlessly, like.a whirlpool, inventing variation themselves which protect them from injury and accident an gradually create a world more favorable +0 their growth. We cannot tell precisely when or how life begins. It come not as a unique event, at a precise stroke of the clock. first living things are simple thermophiles; odd, margina forms, neither plant nor animal, barely over the indefina line which separates the animate from the inanimate. They drift in solitude through the vast, lifeless sea, beneath the incandescent skies of a planet still racked b volcanic eruptions and menaced by the impact of comets an asteroids. In areas protected from the wind, colonies of bacteria ap as scums and muds, \u2018tinting the shores along the water- courses, like bathtub rings. They have no predators; deat something yet unknown. Microbial mats appear _at the edges of the tides. They in give rise to stromatolites; hard, chalky knobs of rock, shaped like cabbages or cauliflowers, the architecture of generations of cyanobacteria living on top of each other, like coral in a reef. Bacteria that once preyed on each other learn gradually t live in community. As such communities become hereditary, first cells with a nucleus arise. Together the bacteria arrive at a result which none by itself could have achiev From the beginning, cooperation plays as great a part as competition in the ascent of life. It succeeds where nake power and selfishness do not, making the deadliest enemie indispensable to each other's survival. The struggle for existence is not life's sole or fundamental law. \fis. Slowly the bacteria creep inland, spreading over the volc debris like a layer of felt. Plants, magic jewel boxes of chlorophyll, soon abound. Instead of drawing nourishment their surroundings, they produce it for themselves, transforming sunlight and carbon into living tissue. Photosynthesis has made life self-sufficient, just at the moment it was living on borrowed time, in danger of eatin every particle of nourishment in the sea. Now life can manufacture its own food -- no longer depend on getting i already made, from a source outside itself. Some of the plants, lacking chlorophyll, find it easier t prey on others than to manufacture \u2018heir own nourishment lean water and sunlight. Thus the First animals arise; Li robbing life; assassins. Alien as they appear, they show the beginnings of need, o purpose and will; the unmistakable marks Of identity, the first true signs of self. Something new has taken root in nature; something which is not driven by external forces set in motion from within,. prompted by itself and nothin else. Colonies of animals arise in which the functions of life cleverly divided. Multicellular creatures spread through seas using every foothold they can find to establish an existence, no matter how narrow or constraining it might first appear. We see the creation, not as an event in the distant past, result of a finished and forgotten act, but rather as something which happens in every moment of time: no less miracle now, ths present hour, than it was in the beginni The film is like asteve, sifting the seed from the husk o appearances, the changeless from the changing. Volvox, sponges, sea fans, anemones, corals and jellyfish the creatures fill the newly hospitable waters in inexhaustible numbers. There are no fish as yet; no crabs shrimp or lobster. And yet it\u2019 is an age of unparalleled opportunity; for the first time, now and never again, a w free of competition. The wildest fancies are permitted; anything can find a place. Bizarre beings spring up from sea's imagination, then vanish forever: Hallucingenia, Opabinia, Anomalocaris. Segmented worms appear, and after them the first vertebra simple fish. Spines and jaws allow the vertebrates to lea the sea floor, to give up grubbing in the mud for nourish in order to prey on larger creatures. \f16. Predators shape their prey, driving them to develop stron armor, greater dexterity and speed. Wondrous fact, that h life not been compelled to face the threat of a violent death, it might never have risen above the ooze. Death comes as a late arrival to the creation, to give li greater capability and scope -- paradoxically, to make it stronger and more lasting. The light flashes at the water's surface above, beckoning higher. Algae spread up from the sea. Mosses and liverwor appear. Here, on land, the plants need not contend for li They seem to rejoice in their new independence, to reach with the vigor of beings unexpectedly set free. By and by the hills are carpeted with a mat of diminutive green vegetation. Frost and lichens break down the rocks into a soil fit fo the more developed plants still waiting by the shore. Horseshoe crabs come up onto the shore to lay their eggs. water, rich as beer, froths and foams around them. Where before there was no sound of life, now we hear the faint, familiar choir of insects. Millipedes forage on the mud flats. Scorpions and ghost crabs come out of the surf to on them. Silverfish follow, and soon winged relatives are evidence. With the power of flight, the insects can range and wide in search of food, scatter their seed and escape their enemies, though as yet no enemy has appeared. Is nature mere weather, doing and undoing without end? Wh does it work toward? What purpose does it have in view? Nothing stands still Or keeps its place. All is growth an ceaseless unfolding. One force works in all, advancing swiftly from form to form, never lingering in any single forever rushing 09; Witnin all things, but not enclosed; outside all, but not eycluded. From time to time, lest we forget that we are sharing our hero's perspective, we cuit back to Jack in the city, goi through the motions of his everyday life. The first fishes with amphibian traits gain the shore. Sw and marshland have replaced the wide, windy plains of the preceding ages. The forms of vegetation are simple, few. There are no reeds or grasses. No flower breaks the gloom The earth is a vast, wet Eden. Except near the poles, the are no seasons. Each year is like the last. Reptiles emerge from the amphibians, and dinosaurs in tur from the reptiles. Among the dinosaurs we discover the fi signs of maternal love, as the creatures learn to care fo each other. \f17. Is not love, too, a work of the creation? What should we been without it? How had things been then? Silent as a shadow, consciousness has slipped into the wo The plant kingdom, too, advances as the first seed plants emerge: cycads, araucarias, conifers and gingkos. Exaltin music alternates with long stretches of peaceful sound; w and waves and summer crickets. Nature seems everywhere to be leading toward\u2019 something. this delay in arriving at its ends? Why does it feel its along -- wander, dawdle, delay? Why twist and turn and backtrack, as though it were finding its way through a ma Why establish hindrances and obstad@S only to put itself the trouble of devising stratagems for overcoming them? Mammals peer out from their hiding places if the trees, waiting for the cold of night to descend and reduce the reptiles to inactivity. None is larger than a squirrel, f larger than a mouse. They are a thin, precarious line -- inconspicuous in the general landscape, holding on agains great odds, in constant danger of being extinguished altogether. This is the fate that befalls the dinosaurs instead, as a large asteroid slams into the earth, covering it for year a pall of dust. The plants die off; the larger reptiles starve. For long years the earth lies fallow. Gradually t mammals come forth to take up those niches which the dinosaurs have left vacant. Nature seems to waste and blunder cruelly. And yet, excep for this disaster, the dinosaurs might have dominated the earth down tothe present day. How strange that calamity a disease should lead life forward ~~ prove indispensable t its unfolding -- that such grandeur should rise up froma foundation of pain and death and ruin! The ichneumon wasp, the crocodile, the shark -- to think they, too, were the fruit of long, painstaking labor and calculation -- brought forth with an equal care! To think that they now go patiently about their tasks, burning wit life as real as ours! Grasses and modern birds now make their appearance; soon thereafter, the first primates. At last we come to man, t triumph of the earth, paragon of creatures and miracle of miracles. He walks with head aloft, his shoulders broad a strong, his gaze fixed on the heavens, the crown and glor creation. . \f18. We suggest, in quick succession, the steps by which he mo from a life of nomadic savagery to a settled, stable cult He tames the reindeer and the wild sheep. He thatches his roof to keep out the shafts of rain. He draws furrows thr the earth and guides the water to his fields. What a short time our race has occupied this globe, what late arrival we are after all -- a beginning -- creatures more of the future than of the past! An unspeakably great future it might be, and yet, though nature should be sufficient to our wants, we have set ourselves against it and against each other. Everything sings in the great chorus;each knows its place and is happy. Man alone does not. i Even now we live in the first day. The splendor of nature's \u00a9 distant beginni shines within us. Yet somehow we have lost our way. Tares stand among the grain: bright red poppies, thistles thorns. The ravaged earth. The ruins of ancient cities. G walls thrown down by war. Dry, abandoned wells. The stone head of some ancient god, buried to his neck in sand. A temple engulfed by the sea. Why does the world lie broken and in heaps? Where did it go wrong? Our hero is left, if not quite where he was before, nevertheless in-doubt and misgiving. He trusted nature to answer his questions. It answers some but raises others i turn. We have lost the eternal ~~ within us and without. How di first come to pass? How does it happen even now, today, i the life of each and all? A ladder, leading up into a tree. A spring, running from rock. A rose. How shall we recover the eternal which. increasingly we s for, without knowing how we should?"}, {"head_type": "heading", "head_text": {"terior": null, "location": null, "shot type": null, "subj": "PART TWO", "ToD": null}, "text": ""}], [{"head_type": "heading", "head_text": {"terior": "EXT.", "location": ["SHORE, HOUSE, BRIDGE, GATE, SPARKS, ETC.", "BOMARZO,"], "shot type": null, "subj": null, "ToD": null}, "text": ""}, {"head_type": "heading", "head_text": {"terior": null, "location": null, "shot type": null, "subj": "COLLODI, BAGNAIA, ETC.", "ToD": null}, "text": "Fast, wide-angle shots; the tempo quick and lively after adagio of nature. \f19.
