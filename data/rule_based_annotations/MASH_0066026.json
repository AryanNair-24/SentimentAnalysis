Trapper's job is repairing a lacerated pulmonary artery, some other delicate piece of surgery close to the heart a involving a large chest incision.

The sequence is silent except for incidental operating ro noises. Even Trapper's occasional terse instructions to his assis and his brief exchange with Ugly John are spoken too low us to hear. There are four stages to the action: 1. The beginning of the operation before an attentive  audience, drawn by their interest in the new man and by t fact that this is a surgical procedure they have never da to attempt. 2. Limited approval and professional respect for the assu with which Trapper plots his incision and starts working way to his destination. 3. Mounting tension as the crucial stage is reached. The  suspense reaches its crest during the few moments when Tr is doing the actual mending job to which all the prelimin have led. The faces of his colleagues express anxiety and hope that he can accomplish what he set out to do, and  accomplish it quickly enough to permit the patient to sur Henry, not certain of his own judgment, looks to Duke for confirmation, and Duke nods to indicate he thinks Trapper has the situation under control. 4.
