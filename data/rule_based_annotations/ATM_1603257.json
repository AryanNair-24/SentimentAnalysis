Disoriented. Bleeding. Freezing. He soon regains his faculties. Looks at the piled-up cars The destruction. The bodies. He crawls over to where Emily\u2019s body now lay.

Overcome by a blinding rage, he leans Emily\u2019s lifeless bo against the wall. Sits her upright, against the badly damaged plaster wall. He tenderly brushes her hair from her pretty face as the achingly cold water continues to spray from the fire sprinklers above. Despite the extensive damage suffered by the vestibule, t emergency lights continue to strobe, interspersing flashe white light with moments of almost complete darkness...

Reaches into his car through the smashed window. Removes jacket. Tears out the liner... Pours a small amount of the tequila onto the jacket liner Stuffs it into the bottle, letting a portion hang outside serve as a wick. A Molotov Cocktail. David then exits what\u2019s left of the vestibule. Walks past the crashed security car. Sees that the gas peddle is wed to the floor with the tire iron. He approaches Corey\u2019s drenched, dead body. He grabs hold of the screwdriver in Corey\u2019s stomach, look away -- and YANKS it out.

His drenched clothes cling his enfeebled frame. Still, David soldiers on. He holds the Molotov Cocktail at the ready. The screwdriv in the other hand. He removes the lighter from his pocket. It lights on the first try. He touches the flame to the alcohol-soaked jac liner. It catches. Covered in blood, and with a look of unbridled hostility his face, David looks every bit the animal his captivity caused him to become. The alarm sounds loudly... The strobe light continues to flash, outside and inside t vestibule... The green security lights spin atop the security car as s emanates from under its damaged hood... The night\u2019s madness has reached its crescendo.. David moves in closer, the screwdriver outstretched befor him. Every step he takes gathers more purpose.
