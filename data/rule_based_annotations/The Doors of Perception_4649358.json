Night. Garwood and Russell both bent over a long basin, vomiting. \"La Purga.\" Russ watches his vomit as the camera zooms toward his eye enters his myriatic pupil. INSIDE RUSS' MIND: his vomit emerges as blood, covering t floor, liquefying it. In the blood swim thousands of vibr worms. The characteristic crackle, the rising hum (DMT particles crashing into the brain's synapses) as the worms, animate like sperm, jump bullet-like from the bloody below, pierc our skin. The voyage has begun. Russell's pupil expands, revealing the vast geography of  hyperspace. Space first appears as GEOMETRIC FORMS, revolving  kaleidoscopically. These quickly assume vegetable form, an inviting cardinal red CHRYSANTHEMUM, its petals beckoning, becoming a white LOTUS blossom. Into the blossom we fly, its core opening onto the JUNGLE canopy. We fly over the jungle, compelling images filling our fie of vision: birds unlike any ever beheld, rippling trees a fauna, indistinguishable creatures in the undergrowth. To our left: the waterfall where dead souls bathe. We are the panther. We know this because we hear the pant heart beating, hear its paws pounding the earth's surface see its paws before us. We dive toward the surface. Into the jungle the panther  plunges. But it is not a jungle, it is an OCEAN and we are under t water now, swimming shark-like alongside pink dolphins an glowing fish of the deep. Great primordial creatures, sea monsters extinct for eons, pass. We burst from the ocean Atlantis-like into a realm of RUI PALACES and LABYRINTHINE CITIES. Empty unpopulated empire rise and fall. African mud cities become Palantine temples; pyramids bec decayed skyscrapers. Throughout melodies mix with the music, snippets of sound contemporary and archaic. A guitar riff from the Fifties, bit of Beethoven, third world instruments. Then, for a moment, above the ruins: a cascade of ADVERTI IMAGERY: the pop culture of signs, slogans and logos rush past. In the ruined cities, we enter the HALL OF ANCESTORS. We our shadow before us, morphing the history of earth's lif forms: sea-going, reptilian, mammalian, ape-like, humanoi The ancestors are stacked in high-rise rows to our right left. All of mankind's faces, Neanderthal, Homo-sapien,  yellow, white, black -- some surprised, some merely curio morphing one to the other like falling dominos. At the top level, we notice, are the gods -- primitive,  ancient unrecognizable divinities yielding to more famili figures: the Egyptian hierarchy, the Greek pantheon, Nord gods and goddesses, the manifestations of Buddha, the Hin cosmology, Mohammed and his followers, Christ and the sai yet, looking closer, we see they are in pain, all writhin like crucified Jesuses.
