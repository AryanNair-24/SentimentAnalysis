My name is Reverend Mother Marie St. Clare. You can call me Reverend Mother, or simply Mother if you prefer that instead.... I\u2019m also the Mother Superior, or Abbess, of this particular Order of Sisters of Beloved Rose. I myself have been a Rose nearly 40 years now. Meaning some 40 years ago, I first walked through those gates as a Postulant- same as all of you- Now 40 years later, I\u2019ve not once set foot outside those gates since... She pauses looking around at all the girls. We watch Cathleen\u2019s eyes lower, trying to avoid her gaze. REVEREND MOTHER (CONT\u2019D) So what is my role, my job here exactly?.... Well as far as all of you are concerned- You might consider me like the voice of God around here... Meaning that unfortunately, since God can\u2019t be here to run this convent Himself- My voice will serve as a stand in for His. And whenever you hear this very voice speak from my mouth- You can expect it\u2019s on behalf of his wishes. \f24. She pauses again, making sure they all heard it. REVEREND MOTHER (CONT\u2019D) Now during the next 2 and a half years of your training to become nuns here, I personally will be separating the wheat from the chafe, determining which of you actually belong. As opposed to which are simply the victims of a childish imagination.... And that\u2019s because here in this room, in this monastery- God is not a fantasy to us. Not a daydream, not a fantasy. And he\u2019s certainly not your invisible best friend either.... To the contrary, God is work. Hard work. The work of a very special kind of love, you\u2019re all going to be trained in. Turning to look at all the girls, we see a multitude of intimidated faces. REVEREND MOTHER (CONT\u2019D) So you'll be spending your first 6 months as postulants. After that, and for those of you who make it- You\u20191l be invited to take your very first vows, in your first temporary marriage to Christ- And enter the Novitiate... However and as a rule, we make a point never to discuss the Novitiate until we\u2019ve been through it ourselves. So for now, you\u2019ll just have to wait. Cathleen looks up, so curious by the notion of the Novitiate. As all the girls are. REVEREND MOTHER(CONT\u2019D) Finally, let\u2019s talk about silence for a moment. Because we observe two types of silence here: Regular Silence and Grand Silence... Now during regular silence, if you find you need to speak for whatever reason. That\u2019s permissible... However and starting at 9pm each night, when you hear that last bell signifying the start of Grande Silence. That means you - Don\u2019t. Talk. Period. We hear a general nervous MURMUR throughout the room. REVEREND MOTHER (CONT\u2019D) Are there any questions? \f25. The room is then deadened, nobody daring to speak. Before some brave young girl in the back raises her hand. However and instead of calling on her, Reverend Mother just looks at the girl blankly for an extremely long time. Beat. It\u2019s awkward. REVEREND MOTHER (CONT\u2019D) Put your hand down sister, postulants don\u2019t have questions. And you are free to go home. She then turns backs to the group as a whole. REVEREND MOTHER (CONT\u2019D) Now, when you return to your cells later this evening... INT. POSTULANT DORMITORY. MAIN HALL -\u2014 DAWN Gazing down the empty hallway in the Postulant dormitory, all is quiet- Before suddenly SISTER ANNE together with SISTER KATE, take the same wooden CLAPPER and start clapping and rattling all the way down the hall. INT. POSTULANT\u2019S CELLS - MORNING A couple of the new POSTULANTS- Sisters SISSY and EVELYN- immediately jolt from sleep, practically falling out of bed and straight onto the floor. They then fumble through their prayers, fighting back the intermittent slew of sighs and yawns. INT. CATHLEEN\u2019S CELL - MORNING Meanwhile in Cathleen\u2019s cell, she herself is already wide awake, fully dressed in her new POSTULANT UNIFORM, and waiting on the edge of her bed. As if so determined to not be late, she literally stayed up all night. Cathleen adjusts and readjusts herself a couple times, before the clapper then finally makes its way to her door. Now she too drops and heads for the floor. \fBlue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 26."}], [{"head_type": "heading", "head_text": {"terior": "INT.", "location": ["NOVITIATE DORMITORY.
