THE GAME AND HOW TO HANDLE IT: shoot a real ga then bring back a quarter of the crowd and all the refs a players. LAMAR is the only actor and he must be a great basketball player at the level his character is intended be. JIM watches uncertainly. And let's go to TOBACK: As the game progresses, several things become apparent: \f103. (1) LAMAR (though looking flashy and, from appearances of form, easily the best player on the court) is playing a horrid game - throwing the ball away, missing shots, allo his man to score. He is so good at his act that he makes appear to be a lack of quickness or grace on the other players\u2019 part that is to blame. (2) The rest of the UCLA team is playing remarkably well. Wild shots are falling through, loose balls are bouncing lucky, rebounds are coming perfectly off. (3) MICHIGAN is having a bad night. Only because of LAMAR errors is anything at all going right for them. There is lid over the rim for their shooters and they throw the ba away continually. (4) Consequently, there is rising sense of panic in JIM ( distress in FRANK). When LAMAR loses the ball to a Michig playing who in turn loses it to a UCLA player who scores, Michigan coach calls a time-out. At this point UCLA leads to 40 with 8:08 remaining in the game so that JIM and ONE only one point ahead of what they need. JIM sees the coac motion LAMAR to the bench and another player to get up to replace him. The new player joins the huddle. LAMAR, on h way to the bench, glances up nervously.
