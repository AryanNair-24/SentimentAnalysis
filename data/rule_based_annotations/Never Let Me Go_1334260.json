We used your art to show what you were capable of. To show that donor children were all but human. But it was all a mistake. We were providing an answer to a question that no one was asking. MISS EMILY glances at MADAME. Then back to TOMMY and KATHY. MISS EMILY (CONT\u2019D) You have to understand. Cancer used to kill almost everyone. Now it kills no one at all. (beat) You see, it\u2019s not an ethical issue. It\u2019s just about the way we are. If you ask people to return to darkness, the days of lung cancer, and breast cancer, and motor neurone disease...
