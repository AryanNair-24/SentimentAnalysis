Eleanor smacks the first photo... a black and white image of a WOMAN nearly skinned alive, hanging from a pole at the center of a mob. ELEANOR (cont'd) Long Sheng Province. 1912. This woman was punished for stealing food. When this photo was taken she was still alive. Look at her eyes. Eleanor holds the photo to Anna. ANGLE ON THE PHOTO... the EYES OF THE WOMAN LOOKING SKYWARD. Eleanor pulls out another old photo. ELEANOR (cont'd) Juliet Lussier. 1945. She was a grocer that slept with a German. At the time, that did not sit well with the French, so she had to pay. (taps the photo) Her eyes. Still alive. And just like the others, the Woman\u0432\u0402\u2122s eyes are rolled upward. Another photo... a WOMAN IN A HOSPITAL BED. \f74. ELEANOR (cont'd) Birmingham, 1960. This woman was in the terminal stages of cancer. Past the use of morphine. She was pronounced dead over a dozen times, and yet she kept living... for days just in this state. Again... the eyes. Then Eleanor starts flipping through the photographs faster. And as we see the ghastly images flashing in front of us, we hear Eleanor\u0432\u0402\u2122s descriptions. ELEANOR (V.0.) (cont'd) Beaten to death by her husband... killed in a head on collision... leukemia... aids... hours of suffering underwater. All of them alive when they were photographed. All seeing something in their final breaths. (beat ) That\u0432\u0402\u2122s what we\u0432\u0402\u2122re recreating... and we\u0432\u0402\u2122ve gotten close with others. That\u0432\u0402\u2122s our hope with Lucie... Eleanor pulls the curtain open again. ELEANOR (cont'd) ...and Emily. And now we see the crowd of people are on their knees, staring up at the Woman, Emily... ...or at least what\u0432\u0402\u2122s left of her She\u0432\u0402\u2122s suspended from an executioner\u0432\u0402\u2122s table... like a metal crucifix fixed on the altar... a half-dozen IV TUBES drip blood from her body into buckets... \u0412\u00bb..aS a PRIEST WHISPERS PRAYERS beside her.
