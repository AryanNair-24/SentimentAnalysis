Jamaican music floats out of a distant window and a group of older men drink from bottles in bags at a picnic table. The asphalt circle in the middle of the four buildings is dark but we can see shadows of people moving around. Groups of young men stand on the sidewalk. Some slowly troll on B.M.X bikes watching every car for brake lights. If a car slows down they circle for a sale. CALVERT begins to walk towards the orange building, his breath is labored by asthma and fear. He sees a shadow out of the corner of his eye and he instinctively runs toward the nearest building. CALVERT busts through the lobby door of a blue building and presses his chubby frame against the cinder block wall. He pulls out his inhaler and takes two quick hits. The flame of a lighter illuminates the otherwise dark stairwell as a rail thin woman lights the end of what used to be the plastic tube of a bic pen. We now see that there's a guy with her and CALVERT goes through a door to the hallway of the first floor of the building. \fCALVERT continues down the hallway and we see the doors of different apartments left open. The sound of T.V.'s squawking and babies crying accompany the toys and kids that litter the thin hall. CALVERT gets to the other end of the hall and goes in to the stairwell. CALVERT steps over a sleeping body and again ventures outside. CALVERT again fixes on the entrance to the orange building that is now only 20 yards away. He takes one more hit from his inhaler and sprints as best he can to the steps of the orange building. CALVERT bursts through the door of the orange building and immediately bounds up the stairs. He turns the corner and THREE YOUNG MEN are standing around a small radio listening to hip-hop music and sharing a 40 ounce malt liquor.
