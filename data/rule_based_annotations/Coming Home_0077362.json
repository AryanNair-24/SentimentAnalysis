I guess the first thing I remember was when I was a kid -- my folks would take us all down to the park. The whole town would turn out. That was a little place in Eastern Oregon called Baker. It used to be a pretty busy town back then., did a lot of gold mining and jumbering. My father was a rancher. It isn't much now, the mines have closed and the trees ain't what they used to be, but I remember it like it was. Seems like my mother spent days cooking for the picnic, and around about July - first,-my\u2019pa's mind would start wanderin' and he wouldn't give a damn about the cattle, That got us kids pretty excited, lookin' forward to all that food and the skyrockets and all. At the park, they'd have flags flyin' and games of chance, kissing booths and wrestling matches. But let me tell you, no matter what they had there to keep me busy, that day was always too long for me. I wanted the sun to go down, \u2018cause when it got dark, th. band would pley the Stars Spangled Bes ner and the fireworks would start up. 1\u2018d just lie back on the grass and watch them things explode, and I'd start thinkin' about how brave those men were that fought in the Revolution. I'd dream about those men, how they went to war for our freedom. I guess that's when I decided to be a soldier, lying in the grass seeing the sky lit up with those rockets, hearing that music. I enlisted when I became of age, I served in Europe in World War 11 and was involved in the . liberation of dozens of towns. As I passed through them, as I saw the faces of the people, I realized I had fulfilled my dream, I had become one of those men who had gone to war for freedom. Anyway, I sure wound up doing what I wanted to, and that's what freedom means, and that's what July Fourth means to me. \f60 yy CONTINUED; Players scrambling for fumbled ball. A completed pass.
