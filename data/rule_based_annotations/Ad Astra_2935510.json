His eyes are light blue, seemingly friendly, but reveal little about the man himse He is even-tempered, but one would not call him kind; the is an icy quality to him. Still, he is not overtly cruel petty, and to talk to him, one could never question his intentions or his integrity. Roy speaks slowly, formally, deliberately, as though he d not want ever to repeat himself. He seems guarded, sincer precise, competent. His face is blank but prone to the occasional awkward joke, and those jokes are made almost self-amusement. He does not seem morose. In fact, he smiles all the time, and his face often ligh with little motivation. He speaks with a very slight Midwestern/Western accent. Think Neil Armstrong.
