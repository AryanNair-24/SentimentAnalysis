At the end of this hollowed-out red fringe is the ovule, which looks like a kind of huge fibrous sponge and seems to be lit from the inside. Rough-hued spermatozoids approach it, like white parasites. They squirm rapidly. Each one has a head and a vibratile tail, linked together by an intermediary segment as long as the head and made of multiple spirals. A first spermatozoid accosts the surface of the ovule. It rushes head-first into the ovular cytoplasm and penetrate the pellucid membrane. It's tail breaks off, abandoned at the surface. Other spermatozoids try to penetrate the membrane. Too late: the route is barred. Once the first fertilizing see been let in, no others can penetrate the surface. My vision penetrates into the cytoplasm behind the spermatozoid.
