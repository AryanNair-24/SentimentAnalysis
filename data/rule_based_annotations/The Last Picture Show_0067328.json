Except for one car -- an old white Nash that belongs to ANDY FANNER, the night- watchman, the square is deserted. Wind blows the curling dust down the empty main street, past the picture show, a laundry, a dinky beauty parlor, a grocery store. A black Chevrolet pickup, vintage 1941, is coughing its way up the long road toward the square. \u2019S PI iP Cl CITY SQUAR: \u2014 DAWN 2 SONNY CRAWFORD riddles intently with the choke, trying to keep the pickup running. The radio is on but the sound of the motor all but drowms it out. In front of the picture show, the pickup dies and the popular 1951 song fills the cab. Sonny relaxes, yawns, peers at the movie posters a moment. (He wears a Levi jacket and his hair is neatly combed -- except for a cowlick at the back, which sticks straight up; now and then, he tries to smoot it down.) Before hitting the starter again, he blows into his hands. The pickup grinds for a minute, then kicks off -- Sonny races the engine before moving on. At the red light he looks over at Fanner, who is asleep in the front seat; his feet, in heavy brogans, are visible, propped on the dashboard, A pickup with three horses in it goes through the light. Sonny starts to turn toward the pool- hall, but far down the street sees a figure sweeping, and drives that way instead. BILLY is sweeping down the white line, toward the city limits sign, ribbons of dust around the broom. (He too wears a frayed Levi jacket -- also an old red baseball cap.) Sonny pulls up beside him and taps his horn. Billy looks up, grins happily, trots around and gets into the cab. Sonny makes a sweeping U-turn, reaches over and turns Billy\u2019s cap around backwards. Billy grins. The song is over and an announcer comes on: COTTONSEED CLARK (v.o.)
