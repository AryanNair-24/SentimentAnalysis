He drops the shotgun and before Griffin even lands, Campbell begins running toward Polly, his feet splashing heavily through the kerosene, his bad leg hindering his progress. As Griffin's back THUMPS flatly in the pool, Campbell watches a wave of kerosene radiate out from under his body. The wave rolls away from him and toward the other candles. Campbell reaches Polly and without breaking stride, scoops her up (chair and all). The wave of kerosene reaches the candles, all of which fall at approximately the same time. As the flames hit, a bright ring of fire SPRINGS UP and races in from the perimeter of the pool, closing in on Campbell. An instant before the wall of flame overtakes him, he SMASHES through the outer window."}], [{"head_type": "heading", "head_text": {"terior": "EXT.", "location": ["WAREHOUSE", "CONTINUOUS"], "shot type": null, "subj": null, "ToD": null}, "text": "Cops and agents wheel around when they hear glass shatter and watch as Campbell and Polly soar through the air and SPLASH into the river, flames roaring out behind them.

Back on the surface, Campbell and Polly desperately scan the water around them, waiting for him to resurface. On the bank, several COPS have pulled their weapons, also waiting for him to resurface. For a long moment, there is no sign of him. Campbell tries to swim toward the bank. TWO COPS dive in and help. They take Polly from him just as Campbell sees Griffin's body bob to the surface nearby, motionless. The cops fish Polly out of the water, but Campbell can't help but make sure Griffin is really dead. He swims a few feet toward the body, which is still face down.
