Over it appear the opening credits. At first it gives a sensation of stillness, but with the insistence of the shot we discover that the fabric is moving, a slight, rhythmic movement. We discover that the fabric is the front of a dress and that Julieta\u2019s heart is beating inside it. Julieta, an attractive woman of 55, independent and full of determination, a mixture of timidity and daring, fragility and courage. Blond. She is sitting next to a bookcase, surrounded by cardboard boxes, the kind used for moving house. She picks up a sculpture of naked, seated man, with the color and texture of terracotta (some 8 inches high), and wraps it carefully in bubble wrap. She places it in one of the cardboard boxes that contains art books, a framed photo with Lorenzo, a book of photos by Nan Goldin, items that she doesn\u2019t want to get rid of. In front of the shelves on which books are piled up in various groups, Julieta tries to decide which she\u20191ll put into boxes and which she\u20191ll leave. A great number of the books have to do with Classical Greece, Mythology, Art, etc. Juliet also puts in the box a novel by Lorenzo Gentile, \u201cAdi\u00e9s, Volcan\u201d, on the cover of which there is a sculpture by Ava, as we will discover in due time, also a naked, seated man. \fThe walls of the apartment are painted white. A sober space with little furniture. Bright and comfortable. Few decorative elements and the few that we see have to do with Lorenzo. In one corner there is a large writing desk and, hanging in the angle formed by the wall, there are three posters. The rest of the walls are bare. A self-portrait of Lucien Freud announces a portrait exhibition in London, another poster by the hyper-realist painter Antonio L\u00e9pez shows the deserted Gran Via in Madrid. The third poster is for the spectacle \u201cThe Old Woman\u201d by Bob Wilson. The three hang in their frames on the walls. Julieta goes over to the writing desk and opens a side drawer. She rummages in the bottom of the drawer until she finds a blue envelope, the size of a Christmas card, the texture of which shows that it has been kept for several years, an old envelope. She takes the envelope out of the drawer and looks at it. The intense blue of the envelope contrasts with the red of the dress she is wearing. Juliet holds it up for a moment, she doubts about putting it in the removals box. Finally she decides to throw it in the wastepaper basket. The wastepaper basket already contains a jumble of papers and cuttings, the result of the clean-out she is doing. The entry phone rings. Julieta goes into the kitchen, answers and then opens the door out to the landing. She goes back to the far end of the sitting room, next to the bookcase, and continues choosing books to pack. 2. MADRID. JULIETA\u2019S HOUSE 2. INT. IN THE MORNING. 2016. SPRING. Lorenzo Gentile in person comes into the apartment. Julieta had previously left the door open. He is aged between 55 and 60, an attractive man, warm-hearted and sincere. A mature, comfortable seducer.

Julieta remains motionless on the sidewalk. She watches helplessly as Beatriz disappears round the next corner with her group of friends. She would swear that the woman dressed with masculine elegance is asking her, intrigued, who she was. Beatriz explains to her. Juliet can\u2019t hear them. 5. MADRID. HOUSE 2. SITTING ROOM. INT. NIGHT. 2016. SPRING. Julieta comes into her apartment with the plastic bags containing her last purchases. Her face is no longer that of the happy, tranquil woman in the first sequences with Lorenzo. Now her expression is somber and agitated. In her mind she hears time and again the conversation with Beatriz in the street, like a ritornello. She can\u2019t get it out of her head. She leaves the bags on the writing desk, picks up the wastepaper basket and puts it on the desk. Julieta rummages around in it, under the gaze of Lucian Freud from one of the posters. In the silence of the night and with the light from the lamp, Freud\u2019s portrait takes on an inquisitive presence. Julieta finally finds the Christmas card-sized blue envelope that she threw out in the morning. Her cell phone rings. It\u2019s Lorenzo. She doesn\u2019t answer it. It rings again, she still doesn\u2019t answer it. Julieta can\u2019t stop looking at the blue envelope while her breathing grows more agitated. 6. MADRID. JULIETA\u2019S HOUSE 2. INT.

The entry phone rings. It\u2019s Lorenzo. Julieta presses the button to let him in. Lorenzo raps on the door. Julieta opens the apartment door, more rigid than usual and looking as if she\u2019s had a bad night. Lorenzo comes into the hall. From the outset he notices that something is amiss.

She empties its contents onto the stool. The \fsurface is covered with tiny pieces of a photo that had been carefully torn up.

The photo which had been torn into a thousand pieces and scattered is beside her, intact again. Julieta is holding a thick, hard-covered Italian notebook. On the first page she writes the name ANTIA in capital letters. From its position, in the middle of the page, Antia is the title of everything she will write afterwards. The scant initial text is written as a list: Two sons and one daughter. \fShe came down to Lake Como to shop, so she lives in a town where there are few stores. Perhaps she lives ina nearby, expensive Swiss town and she went to shop in Italy which is much cheaper. She doesn\u2019t wear make-up. And she\u2019s thin. She thinks I\u2019m still living in Madrid. 15. MADRID. THE STREET. EXT. DAY. CONT. 2016. SPRING. A VERY TYPICAL IMAGE OF PRESENT DAY MADRID. Coinciding with the words \u201cliving in Madrid\u201d we see Julieta walking slowly along a street full of people. A sunny spring day. She looks at everyone, especially the women. She smiles at one who has two children by the hand. 16. MADRID. OPEN AIR BASKETBALL COURT. EXT. CONT. 2016. SPRING. In the neighborhood where she lives. She goes into an open air basketball court.

She now has a table where she can write. And a good chair that supports her back. And a table lamp. In the background, on a sideboard, we see four small framed photos. With her parents, with Xoan, with Ava and with Lorenzo. There are two pictures on the wall. Set out on the table are two jars with pencils and markers and the hard-backed Italian notebook. We also see the photo which had been torn into a thousand pieces and is now stuck back together like a jigsaw puzzle. It\u2019s the first time it appears. In the photo Julieta is posing with the adolescent Antia. A photo crisscrossed with scars. The shelves are full of books. There is more than enough space for a woman on her own.

There are creels, enormous blue and red marker buoys, several wine colored nets, etc. And in the middle of the room, a long, very old metal table (used for cleaning and sorting fish) with an opening at one end for drainage. A blanket has been spread on the table. On top of the blanket is a body covered from head to toe by a sheet. The sheet is clinging to the body and describes precisely its orography.

On the road, a car, driven by Julieta. The car disappears immediately, swallowed by one of the tunnels. Julieta, immersed in the darkness inside the car, switches on a little pilot light, takes a piece of paper and places it next to the steering wheel. It\u2019s a map of the area drawn by her daughter. On the passenger seat there is a Michelin guide and a bag with food and drink. It\u2019s a long trip and she isn\u2019t used to driving for so many hours. She looks tired and nervous. PYRENEES. TURN-OFF. STONY DIRT TRACK. EXT. 2003. FALL. She takes a narrow dirt track, riddled with large potholes and stones of all sizes. It\u2019s a track eroded by the last winter snow. Julieta is driving a rental vehicle, with very bad suspension. The car lurches along the path, and although Juliet slows down she is constantly jolted around inside the car. The surroundings are spectacular, but the damn track is hell. The map shows a flat open space. The car arrives there. At the end of an impassible track she can make out an isolated stone house. PYRENEES. ISOLATED STONE HOUSE. EXT. DAY. 2003. FALL. \fJulieta stops the car. She gets out with Antia\u2019s map in her hand. The stone house, which looks impregnable, has a fence that runs around a lush green meadow. In the middle of the meadow there are two benches next to a table, all made of wood and very rudimentary. Really they are just three wooden planks on which you can sit and rest your elbows. The house is the only visible construction in the middle of nature.

There\u2019s a return address, a town in Switzerland. In the bedroom, he fills one of Julieta\u2019s bags with clothes, the most essential things. He doesn\u2019t know the apartment, but he knows her belongings. He is amazed by the bareness of the place, there are no decorative items, except for Ava\u2019s omnipresent sculpture. On the desk, he finds the notebooks which Julieta has written to Antia. Lorenzo looks at them, paralyzed, because he senses that their pages uncover the enigma surrounding Julieta. The last notebook is still open at the latest notes. He closes it. He avoids the temptation of reading those lines, still fresh. He sees the reconstructed photo of Julieta and Antia on the table. \f161. 162. He also discovers a photo of the two of them, Julieta and Lorenzo, on one of their trips.
