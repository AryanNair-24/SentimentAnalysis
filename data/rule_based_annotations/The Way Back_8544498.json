ZORAN; After cleaning his teeth with a twig, hangs his suit on a driftwood hanger and is seen brushing it with a branch from a pine tree. TOMASZ teases him and suggests he do something useful. Later this leads to him sorting the boiled bones into various sizes, a sort of accountant of the \u2018bone-bank\u2019. \u2018Customers\u2019 come to him looking for bones or teeth for various uses. JANUSZ; Works on the reindeer skin. With SMITH\u2019s help he stretches it to dry on a driftwood frame. Later, he cuts a piece off and gives it to VOSS for the back-pack. He also works scraping the skin of strands of unwanted meat and fat. IRENA; Sleeps and eats. It is only at dusk one day she seems to come to life and moving to the lakeside washes her clothes and hair.

It is with a backdrop of this luxuriant green that Indian faces look up toward the slopes. Here they watch three wild looking bearded men descending toward them. The additional cost of this final leg of their journey is plainly visible on their faces, and in their slow stumbling movements. They walk like automatons, only their senses fully alive. Shouts from the locals produce a village ELDER, then a POLICEMAN.
