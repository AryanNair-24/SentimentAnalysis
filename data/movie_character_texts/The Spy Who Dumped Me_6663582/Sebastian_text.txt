63) 2) dialog: Keep moving! Go! Go! The F-15s buzz over the ARENA. DROP THEIR PAYLOAD. Sebastian pulls them away as fast as he can as the buildi EXPLODES. A fiery boom. Then just a fire.

High profile people. The plans will be on that drive. So if we had it, we’d know how to stop them. Audrey is about to say something when -- THE DOOR OPENS. WENDY enters with PATEL -- his nose broke and bandaged.
65) 0) text: Wendy coldly sits across from Sebastian.
65) 2) dialog: Wendy, I know I --
65) 4) dialog: I know I overstepped --

67) 11) dialog: Sorry about all the dog hair back there.
67) 13) dialog: I don’t have company car privileges right now. Or for the next five months.
67) 15) dialog: No you didn’t. I’1l be fine. And I don’t know what Patel said to you in there but this situation would be much worse if you hadn’t flushed that drive and it ended up in the wrong hands.
67) 17) dialog: And they would have died if you'd never found the drive in the first place. This is not your fault. A moment. 67.
67) 19) dialog: Well, hopefully we could de-encrypt it. Then ideally, we’d see what Highland’s plans are and stop them.
67) 21) dialog: Why do you want to know?
67) 23) dialog: Sorry?
67) 25) dialog: Are you fucking kidding?!
67) 29) dialog: So even when you were being tortured... you didn’t give it up. Sebastian is really impressed with Audrey.
67) 31) dialog: Right then, not to be impolite but do you think you might... access it? From... the place where--
67) 34) dialog: Uh, I’11 take that. An awkward -- and extremely intimate -- moment as Audrey hands the drive to Sebastian. He puts it on the dash, the turns off at an exit for CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT.
67) 37) dialog: Maybe. But I may try to take this one on myself.
67) 39) dialog: I'll figure something out. A moment. Audrey and Morgan exchange a look.
67) 42) dialog: No. No. You two have risked your lives enough as it is. A moment. Then the other part of the truth comes out. 69.
67) 46) dialog: You're not pretending. Sebastian DOES AN AGGRESSIVE U-TURN. New plan.
69) 0) text: Breathtaking details, centuries-old books. A tourist destination. But these are no ordinary tourists. The READING ROOM -- Sebastian inserts the FLASH DRIVE int his laptop while the girls look on. The same ENCRYPTED numbers and letters that appeared in the Apple Store pop
69) 1) dialog: Hmmmm. That’s odd. He LOOKS DOWN AT THE DRIVE. Then back at Audrey. Then bac the DRIVE. Audrey gets paranoid about what he’s judging.
69) 3) dialog: No, no. I mean on the drive... this is State Department encryption.
69) 5) dialog: Highland didn’t make this. Your government did. I can’t access it. I don’t have clearance. I’m suspended. 70.
69) 7) dialog: They change it every 24 hours. It’s 16 characters. Numbers, letters, case-sensitive. Even if I hada supercomputer, it would take days.
69) 9) dialog: We can’t get into the flash drive. I’m saying we lost. A sober moment for all of them.
69) 11) dialog: Not unless you have access to some sort of expert on U.S. intelligence computer security. Morgan gets an idea.

77) 20) dialog: Yeah. Breakups suck. As you know. A moment of connection.
77) 22) dialog: It’s more complicated than that. People reveal who they are in the end. It doesn’t mean what you had wasn’t real.

83) 4) dialog: Imagine the power that comes from unlimited information. Blackmail, theft, they can take anything. Know anything. This is why people are --
83) 15) dialog: I’m busy.
83) 20) dialog: Your name is Morgan Freedman?

Or I’m coming in there. They start dancing. Drew subtly NODS over Audrey’s should SEBASTIAN (CONT’D) If you see me, why aren’t you fucking moving?!
87) 10) dialog: Don’t you dare give her your number. Do not give a witness at the bar where you’re about to murder a man your phone number.
90) 0) text: Audrey and Sebastian, as before. Audrey is overwhelmed.
90) 1) dialog: My point is, being with someone -- caring about them -- makes our job harder. So if Drew was trying with you... that was real.
90) 3) dialog: He got himself killed. A moment. Sebastian tries to lighten the mood. SEBASTIAN (CONT’D) And not that you asked my opinion, but I would say the worst song on that jukebox is “Your Body is a Wonderland.” No question.

93) 15) dialog: My ass? I couldn’t have done that with my arm like this! I wouldn’t have been able to get the angle.
94) 1) dialog: We need to check who he’s texting. Audrey takes a breath, and wades into the water. His dead face stares back at her. She winces, reaches into his jac removes the phone before it gets wet. Slides to unlock it
94) 5) dialog: Let’s find out. Tell them we have it and ask them where the drop is. She writes back. A moment, then another BUZZ. “Bring it to Operation Albrecht.”
