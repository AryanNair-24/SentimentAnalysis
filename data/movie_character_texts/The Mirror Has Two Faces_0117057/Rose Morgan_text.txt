6) 15) dialog: Doesn't matter. He asked. He wants her. God, what was I thinking!? That all of a sudden, this veil would be lifted and he would want me instead of this gorgeous woman with no stomach whose ten years younger?
6) 20) dialog: I should have never had coffee with him that first time he asked. He was too good looking ~- I knew I couldn't handle it. Never again. I mean, you've got to come to terms with your life or else what's the point? I'll never be a beauty. I'll never have some gorgeous guy in love with ne, screaming my name in the streets.

They way people in love know each other - isn't that stupid? Their favorite toothpaste, their nightmares, their secrets. That's what cures loneliness. When somebody else is out there who knows who you are ~ and whose thinking about you. And who wants you.
6) 37) dialog: No. Living alone sounds very Holly Golightly in theory but the truth is you come home to an empty apartment every night. I'm not pretty enough to live alone. I'd turn into a cat lady who flirts with delivery boys.
6) 42) dialog: It looks better on her.
8) 16) dialog: «+. I believe it's our addictions to illusions like perfect sex and true love that are actually keeping people today separate and alone. "Falling in love" is a man-made conceit. Before the Industrial Revolution - before men left the home for business and women became the leisure class - before sex and beauty were used as marketing tools for the propagation of the species - She refers to daguerreotypes and tintypes depicting image women as objects of beauty. ROSE (Cont'd) What drew men and women together? I can tell you one thing - it must have been a lot more real than what's drawing them today. A fifty percent aivorce rate among married couples - more single parents than you can count. Which is fine - but why? Because people want children and not relationships. Relationships are too hard. Why? Because we are asked to meet ridiculous, romantic standards! Gregory is mesmerized. ROSE (Cont'd) Do you know how many lonely people there are waiting for this perfect, romantic love - this illusion when actually their perfect mate might be right in front of them only they can't recognize it.

As she sings along, getting stoned, we get a glimpse into a younger Rose - a sixties hopeful with a great joy and thirst for life, before any expectations vanished. She then inhales bit too much, and must use every effort not to cough out loud - banging her hands against the furniture, her eyes tearing. She makes sure to exhale out an opened window. S takes a deep breath, then douses out the joint on the sil She takes her cupcake to her bed and makes a tray out of art book.

We can by her expression, that she isn't really watching the gam listening to the music or even consciously chewing. She's thinking about Gregory. But then she decides. ROSE (Cont'd) No. I was right to say no. That was a good move. Have lunch with a guy like that, next thing you know I'm cooking for him and holding his hand when he has problems and fantasizing about raping him in a restaurant. Never again. The end. End of story! THE PHONE RINGS. Stoned, she stares at it for a moment or two, fascinated by the ringing. Until - -

8) 77) dialog: No. I almost bought it though. I held it in my hands in the bookstore for a good ten minutes. GREGORY. That's all right, I'll send you a copy ... but getting back to the three for a minute, what you might find interesting for what you teach is the importance of the relationship. See, without the three, relationship - a number, or a person, is just ...
8) 78) dialog: Spinning it's own gears.
8) 80) dialog: I know. First time I had lunch with a guy where I feel like I'm winning on a game show. Gregory suddenly feels insecure.
8) 87) dialog: What are we in fifth grade? He likes me! He likes my brain.

8) 100) dialog: ».. I just think you have to relate what you teach them in a way that touches their lives a bit more directly. Let them get to know you.
8) 106) dialog: You need to loosen up a little. Don't wear a jacket and tie. Joke around. Find the humor in it.
8) 108) dialog: Well - if numbers represent some metaphysical meaning in the Universe uh ... there's got to be a joke in there somewhere. I mean, metaphysics, the universe - it's hilarious.
8) 116) dialog: why?
8) 118) dialog: Gee, the last time I looked the David had a dick. Things are getting heated. Gregory is loving it.
8) 122) dialog: I'm not offended. I just think times are changing. In some tribes - like the Wodaabes, it's the men who spend hours in make-up sessions and are judged in beauty contests by the women. And they're a much older society than ours - maybe we're just catching up. Men as objects of female lust is quite natural and if women are going to make themselves sick and surgically alter themselves to stay in the running, you men are going to have skip the extra beer and tighten your butts too.
8) 127) dialog: Yes.
8) 129) dialog: We're not together. We're just associates. How long have you been seeing Henry?

10) 4) dialog: Why?
10) 6) dialog: Can I ask you a question? If you could switch places with me, would you? Candy stops applying lipstick. She feels uncomfortable by question. Her answer is obviously no. ROSE (Cont'd) See, that's the difference.
10) 9) dialog: The perfect bite. He leans over to her.
10) 13) dialog: Around the 12th Century they had a thing called Courtly Love - and it was a love usually between a knight and a lady he idolized, worshipped...But the rules were they could never have sex, never be married and yet they must always keep their passion for each other alive...It was as if they took this baser human love and through their restrictions squeezed everything out it that was thought to be impure or temporary. It was thought to be one of the highest expressions of love. As opposed to the more human, everyday, going-to-the-bathroom-in- front-of-each-other kind of love. Gregory is inspired. INT.
