Across the room, CELINE emerges from behind a row of book where she's been hiding and listening.

2) 22) dialog: I have a little time. Want to get out of here?
2) 24) dialog: Yes? Jesse goes back over to the manager.

3) 41) dialog: No... I don't hate you. C'mon, no big deal. I flew over there, you blew the whole thing off, I gave up on love, and my life's been a big nose-dive since then, but hey, no big deal.
3) 43) dialog: I'm kidding.
3) 47) dialog: Honestly, I had a feeling something like that might have happened. I was bummed, but I was mostly just mad that we hadn't exchanged phone numbers or any information.
3) 49) dialog: I know! We had nothing to go on.
3) 51) dialog: I know, remember the reason we did that...we were both afraid if we started calling and writing it would slowly fade away.
3) 53) dialog: Sure wasn't.

3) 65) dialog: Then I just walked around for a while then eventually flew back home. I owed my dad two grand, who had warned me about French chicks.
3) 67) dialog: Nothing, lots of crap. He's never been with any French women. I don't think he's ever been east of the Mississippi.
3) 69) dialog: But I did!

3) 75) dialog: And then they find out more about each other and realize they don't really get along.
3) 77) dialog: My editor didn't feel that way.
3) 79) dialog: Yep.
3) 81) dialog: It's a tiny bestseller, but officially, yes. But hey, most people haven't read Moby Dick, so why the hell should they read my book?
3) 83) dialog: Hey, it's fiction.
3) 85) dialog: But you are a little like that.
3) 87) dialog: Just kidding. No really, where’d I do that?
3) 90) dialog: Why was it disturbing?
3) 92) dialog: On and off, 3 or 4 years.
3) 94) dialog: Tell mea about it. I feel like I basically lived with you there for a while.
3) 96) dialog: T had a pretty clear picture of you in my mind. I gotta tell you something - I've wanted to talk to you for so long...
3) 98) dialog: It's surreal, now I feel everything I say should be...

3) 106) dialog: Wow.
3) 108) dialog: I gotta say I admire the fact that it sounds like you are actually DOING something. Most people, myself included, just bitch about everything: how America's consuming all the world's resources, we're creating sweat shops in China, SUVs suck global warming...
3) 110) dialog: Nah. But I gotta say, I think that's S80 cool what you're doing. How'd you get into that?
3) 115) dialog: I gotta say, that's awesome. I always figured you'd be doing something cool like that.
3) 117) dialog: You know, I actually alternate in thinking that everything is irrevocably screwed up, and actually feeling things in a general might be getting better.
3) 119) dialog: I know it sounds weird, but I think there are things to be optimistic about.

3) 128) dialog: I mean the very notion of conservation and environmental issues - all that weren't even in the vocabulary until fairly recently - those are becoming the norm and will eventually be what's expected all over the world.
4) 1) dialog: Any particular imperialist country you got in mind there, Frency?
4) 3) dialog: Perfect. But what I'm really saying is the world might be evolving like a person evolves. ME for example... Am I improving? Am I getting worse? When I was younger I was healthier but I was racked with insecurity- Now I'm older my problems are deeper, but I'm more equipped to handle them.

4) 84) dialog: Not really.
4) 86) dialog: Right .
4) 88) dialog: Yeah, that's such a struggle.
4) 93) dialog: It seems like we're designed to be slightly dis-contented with everything. Always trying to better @ our situation. You satisfy one desire and it just agitates another. But then I think, well, desire is the fuel of life. Do you think it's true that we'd never be unhappy if we never wanted anything?
4) 96) dialog: That's what all those Buddhist cats say, right, liberate yourself from desire and you will find you already have everything you need.
4) 98) dialog: Yeah... I guess it's just entitlement that brings all the pain. Whenever you feel you deserve that pair of shoes, that your desires SHOULD be met. It's all right to have wants and needs as long as you don't get angry when they're not realized. Life is hard, it's supposed to be, if we didn't suffer we would never learn a thing.

4) 110) dialog: I was shocked - I expected them to be ail glowering and stern but they weren't - they were quick to laugh and really easy to be around, very attuned to everything. They're not trying to hustle anybody, they're not trying to accomplish anything, they are trying to live and die in peace and be close with God or whatever part of them they feel is eternal - it's so refreshing to be around. You realize that the bulk of people that you meet are trying to get somewhere better, make a little more jack, get a little more respect, have more people admire them... it's exhausting.

6) 42) dialog: The older I get, I think maybe so. I read about this study where they * followed people that had won the * lottery and people who'd become paraplegics. We're led to believe one would make us euphoric and the other suicidal. The study showed * that within about six months, once they'd more or less gotten used to their new situation, they were fundamentally the same as they were before.

But the guy, the soldier, just waited, sitting there, and he just couldn't do it. When the allied troops eventually came in they found all the explosives and the switch just lying there. They found the same thing at Sacre-Coeur, the Eiffel Tower and two other places, I think. I always liked that story. Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 41.
