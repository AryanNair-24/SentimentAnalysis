0) 37) dialog: "Bare Ruined Choirs: Triumph of the  Common Man. The star of the Bare  Ruined Choirs was not seen on the  stage of the Belasco last night В–  though the thespians involved all  acquitted themselves admirably. The  find of the evening was the author  of this drama about simple folk В–  fish mongers, in fact В– whose brute  struggle for existence cannot quite  quell their longing for something  higher. The playwright finds nobility  in the most squalid corners and poetry  in the most callused speech. A tough  new voice in the American theater  has arrived, and the owner of that  voice is named... Barton Fink."
