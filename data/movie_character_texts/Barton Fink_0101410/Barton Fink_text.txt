0) 17) dialog: He hesitates, unable to take it all in. He is gently nudged toward the stage by the two tuxedoed  gentlemen. As he exits toward the stage the applause is deafening.
0) 26) dialog: Not yet.
0) 30) dialog: Thanks, Richard, but I know for a  fact the only fish you've ever seen  were tacked to a the wall of the  yacht club.
0) 35) dialog: Please Derek В–
0) 38) dialog: They'll be wrapping fish in it in  the morning so I guess it's not a  total waste.
0) 41) dialog: Don't get me wrong В– I'm glad it'll  do well for you, Derek.
0) 43) dialog: All right, but I can't start listening  to the critics, and I can't kid myself  about my own work. A writer writes  from his gut, and his gut tells him  what's good and what's... merely  adequate.
0) 48) text: Aaa-woooooooo! Barton turns to look for the source of an insistent jingl We swish pan off him to find a busboy marching through th restaurant displaying a page sign, bell attached, with  Barton's name on it.
0) 51) dialog: I thought you were going to join us.   Jesus, Garland, you left me alone  with those people.
0) 53) dialog: The play was marvelous. She wept,  copiously. Millions of dollars and  no sense. Garland smiles, then draws Barton close.
0) 55) dialog: To do what?
0) 57) dialog: I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try  to make a difference.
0) 59) dialog: To see pap.
0) 61) dialog: I don't know, Garland; my place is  here right now. I feel I'm on the  brink of success-
0) 63) dialog: No, Garland, don't you see? Not the  kind of success where the critics  fawn over you or the producers like  Derek make a lot of money. No, a  real success В– the success we've  been dreaming about В– the creation  of a new, living theater of, about,  and for the common man! If I ran off  to Hollywood now I'd be making money,  going to parties, meeting the big  shots, sure, but I'd be cutting myself  off from the wellspring of that  success, from the common man. He leans back and chuckles ruefully.
0) 64) dialog: ...I guess I'm sprouting off again.  But I am certain of this, Garland:  I'm capable of more good work. Maybe  better work than I did in Choirs. It  just doesn't seem to me that Los  Angeles is the place to lead the  life of mind.
0) 67) dialog: No, what did it say?
0) 70) dialog: ...That's a rationalization, Garland. Garland smiles gently.
0) 77) dialog: I'm checking in. Barton Fink. The clerk flips through cards on the desk.
0) 79) dialog: Must be.
0) 82) dialog: Excuse me?
0) 84) dialog: I don't know... I mean, I'll be here,  uh, indefinitely.
0) 86) dialog: Well, I'm going to be working here,  mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do  you have room service?
0) 90) dialog: Huh? The clerk.
0) 92) dialog: What В–
0) 94) dialog: ...What number is it? The clerk stares back.
0) 97) dialog: The others are being sent. The clerk leans over the desk to call after him:
0) 100) dialog: ...Six, please. The elevator man gets slowly to his feet. As he pushes th door closed:
0) 105) dialog: Looking at the picture
0) 109) dialog: ...Who is this?
0) 111) dialog: ...Who?
0) 116) dialog: His eyes move this way and that. After a silent beat, he  shuts them again. After another silent beat, we hear В– muffled, probably f am adjacent room В– a brief, dying laugh. It is sighing a weary, like the end of a laughing fit, almost a sob. Silence again. We hear the rising mosquito hum.
0) 124) dialog: It's not as bad as it looks; just a  mosquito in my room В–
0) 127) dialog: I'm at the Earle.
0) 129) dialog: Thanks, but I wanted a place that  was less...
0) 134) dialog: To be honest, I don't go to the  pictures much, Mr. Lipnik В–
0) 136) dialog: ...Yes, thank you.
0) 146) dialog: ...Both maybe? There is a disappointed silence. Lipnik looks at Lou.  Lo clears his throat.
0) 152) dialog: Elbows on his desk, he looks down at what he has just wri He rolls the paper up a few lines, looks some more.
0) 156) dialog: After a beat he rolls the sheet back into place.
0) 158) dialog: В– as he continues typing. He stops after several more  characters and looks. Silence. Breaking the silence, muffled laughter from an adjacent r A man's laughter. It is weary, solitary, mirthless. Barton looks up at the wall directly in front of him.
0) 160) dialog: Staring, as the end-of-the-tether laughing continues. Bar looks back down at his typewriter as if to resume work, b the sound is too insistent to ignore.
0) 161) text: The room, Barton sitting at his desk, staring at the wall The laughter. Barton pushes his chair back, goes to the door, opens it looks out.
0) 162) text: The empty hallway, a pair of shoes before each door. At t end of the hall a dim red bulb burns over the door to the staircase, punctuating the sick yellow glow of the line o wall sconces. The laughter, though still faint, is more resonant in the empty hall. Perhaps its quality has changed, or perhaps simply becaus it is so insistent, the laughter now might be taken for  weeping. Barton pauses, trying to interpret the sound. He slowly  withdraws into his room.
0) 164) dialog: Hello... Chet? This is Barton Fink  in room 605. Yes, there's uh, there's  someone in the room next door to  mine, 604, and he's uh... He's uh...  making a lot of... noise. After a beat:
0) 165) dialog: ...Thank you. He cradles the phone. The laughter continues for a moment two, then abruptly stops with the muffled sound of the  telephone ringing next door. Barton looks at the wall. The muffled sound of a man talking. The sound of the earpiece being pronged. Muffled footsteps next door. The sound of the neighbor's door opening and shutting.   Footsteps approaching the hall. A hard, present knock at Barton's door. Barton hesitates for a beat, then rises to go get the doo
0) 168) dialog: No, I didn't В– I mean, I did call  down, not to complain exactly, I was  just concerned that you might В– not  that it's my business, but that you  might be in some kind of... distress.  You see, I was trying to work, and  it's, well, it was difficult В–
0) 171) dialog: Barton Fink. Unfazed, Charlie Meadows unpockets a flask.
0) 173) dialog: That's all right, really, thank you.
0) 176) dialog: Okay... a quick one, sure... He gets two glasses from the wash basin.  Charlie sits do on the edge of the bed and uncorks his flask.
0) 178) dialog: That's okay, I assure you. It's just  that I was trying to work В–
0) 180) dialog: Well, I'm a writer, actually.
0) 182) dialog: Can be. Not easy, but В–
0) 184) dialog: And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
0) 187) dialog: Doesn't surprise me at all.
0) 189) dialog: Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
0) 191) dialog: No, I'm actually writing for the  pictures now В–
0) 195) dialog: That's okay; actually I am just  starting out in the movies В– though  I was pretty well established in New  York, some renown there,
0) 197) dialog: That's okay, Charlie. I'm a  playwright. My shows've only played  New York. Last one got a hell of a  write-up in the Herald. I guess that's  why they wanted me here.
0) 199) dialog: What do I write about? Charlie laughs.
0) 201) dialog: Well, that's a good question. Strange  as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I  write about people like you. The  average working stiff. The common  man.
0) 203) dialog: Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way,  that's exactly the point. There's a  few people in New York В– hopefully  our numbers are growing В– who feel  we have an opportunity now to forge  something real out of everyday  experience, create a theater for the  masses that's based on a few simple  truths В– not on some shopworn  abstractions about drama that doesn't  hold true today, if they ever did... He gazes at Charlie.
0) 204) dialog: ...I don't guess this means much to  you.
0) 206) dialog: And that's the point, that we all  have stories. The hopes and dreams  of the common man are as noble as  those of any king. It's the stuff of  life В– why shouldn't it be the stuff  of theater?  Goddamnit, why should  that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't  call it new theater, Charlie; call  it real theater. Call it our theater.
0) 208) dialog: Well, I don't mean to get up on my  high horse, but why shouldn't we  look at ourselves up there?  Who  cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop  and Lady Higginbottom and В– and В–  and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
0) 210) dialog: Exactly, Charlie! You understand  what I'm saying В– a lot more than  some of these literary types. Because  you're a real man!
0) 212) dialog: Sure you could!  And yet many writers  do everything in their power to  insulate themselves from the common  man В– from where they live, from  where they trade, from where they  fight and love and converse and В–  and В– and... so naturally their work  suffers, and regresses into empty  formalism and В– well, I'm spouting  off again, but to put it in your  language, the theater becomes as  phony as a three dollar bill.
0) 214) dialog: Frequently played, seldom remarked. Charlie laughs.
0) 216) dialog: You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad  you stopped by. I'm sorry if В– well  I know I sometimes run on.
0) 218) dialog: Well, we've got something in common  then. Charlie is getting to his feet and walking to the door.
0) 220) dialog: Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by  just being yourself.
0) 223) dialog: See you, Charlie. Charlie closes the door and is gone. Barton goes back to his desk and sits. Muffled, we can hear the door of the adjacent room openin and closing. Barton looks at the wall.
0) 225) dialog: He looks around to the opposite В–  bed В– wall.
0) 236) dialog: I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum  said I should drop by morning to see  you about the В–
0) 238) dialog: ...Huh? No, I'm В–
0) 240) dialog: I'm a writer. Ted O В–
0) 242) dialog: I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're  producing this Wallace Beery picture  I'm working on.
0) 244) dialog: Then who should I talk to? Geisler gives a hostile stare. Without looking at her, he addresses the secretary:
0) 251) dialog: But Lipnik said he wanted to look at  the script, see something by the end  of the week.
0) 253) dialog: Okay. I'm just having trouble getting  started. It's funny, I'm blocked up.   I feel like I need some kind of  indication of... what's expected В–
0) 256) dialog: Who? Geisler rises and throws his napkin onto his plate.
0) 260) dialog: He quickly straightens and goes to the sink. He starts wa his hands. We hear the stall door being unlatched. Barton glances over his shoulder.
0) 262) dialog: Quickly, self-consciously, he looks back down at his hand
0) 264) dialog: Forcing himself to look at his hands. We hear the man rea the adjacent sink and turn on the tap. Barton can't help glancing up.
0) 266) dialog: He gives a nervous smile В– more like a tic В– and looks down at his hands. We hear the man gargling water and spi into the sink. After a moment, Barton looks up again.
0) 268) dialog: Looks back down, then up again.
0) 271) dialog: Barton Fink. They shake, then return to their ablutions. We hold on Barton as we hear Mayhew's faucet being turned off and his foot-steps receding. For some reason, Barton' eyes are widening.
0) 272) dialog: ...Jesus. W.P.! The dapper little man stops and turns.
0) 274) dialog: W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
0) 276) dialog: Bill!... Mayhew cocks his head with a politely patient smile. Fina Barton brings out:
0) 277) dialog: ...You're the finest novelist of our  time. Mayhew leans against a stall.
0) 280) dialog: Sir, I'm flattered that you even  recognize my name. My God, I had no  idea you were in Hollywood.
0) 283) dialog: It's still a little early for me.
0) 285) dialog: ...Bill, if I'm imposing you should  say so, I know you're very busy В– I  just, uh... I just wonder if I could  ask you a favor... That is to say,  uh... have you ever written a  wrestling picture? Mayhew eyes him appraisingly, and at length clears his th
0) 291) text: On Barton, standing in front of the door. The noise abates for a moment. We hear the woman's voice  again. Barton hesitates, listening; he thinks, decides, knocks. With this the woman's voice stops, and Mayhew starts wail again. The door cracks open. The woman looks as if she has been crying.
0) 293) dialog: I'm sorry, I... My name is Fink...  Uh, Bill asked me to drop by this  afternoon.  Is he in?
0) 298) dialog: Is, uh... Is he okay?
0) 304) dialog: How about you? Will you be alright?
0) 306) dialog: Yes I am. I'm working on a wres В–  please call me Barton. Audrey reaches out and touches Barton's hand.
0) 308) dialog: Perhaps you and I could get together  at some point also. В–I'm sorry if  that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't  know anyone here in this town. Audrey smiles at him.
0) 310) dialog: Please, Barton.
0) 314) dialog: I see.
0) 316) dialog: No, no В– Hurriedly:
0) 323) text: On the tack. As Barton applies pressure to push it in, ta yellow goo oozes out of the puncture hole and beads aroun the tack.
0) 325) dialog: As his ear meets the wall. The woman's moaning continues. We hear the creaking of  bedsprings and her partner, incongruously giggling. Barton grimaces, gets down off the bed and crosses to the secretary, where he sits. He stares at the paper in the  carriage.
0) 331) dialog: Charlie. How are you.
0) 333) dialog: Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really  gotten started yet В– what happened  to your ear? В– for Charle's left ear is plugged with cotton wadding. he enters:
0) 335) dialog: Seen a doctor? Charlie gives a dismissive wave.
0) 337) dialog: No, I guess you're stuck with the  one you've got. Have a seat. Charlie perches on the corner of the bed.
0) 339) dialog: Nope.
0) 342) dialog: No... I guess it's something about  my work. I get so worked up over it,  I don't know; I don't really have a  lot of attention left over, so it  would be a little unfair...
0) 344) dialog: My folks live in Brooklyn, with my  uncle.
0) 347) dialog: Sure, that's tough, but in a sense,  we're all alone in this world aren't  we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by  family and friends, but... He shrugs.
0) 352) dialog: You know, in a way, I envy you  Charlie.  Your daily routine В– you  know what's expected. You know the  drill. My job is to plumb the depths,  so to speak, dredge something up  from inside, something honest. There's  no road map for that territory... He looks from Charlie to the Underwood.
0) 353) dialog: ...and exploring it can be painful.  The kind of pain most people don't  know anything about. He looks back at Charlie.
0) 354) dialog: ...This must be boring you.
0) 356) dialog: Yeah... He gives a sad chuckle.
0) 357) dialog: ...Probably sounds a little grand  coming from someone who's writing a  wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
0) 359) dialog: Nope, never watched any. I'm not  that interested in the act itself В–
0) 362) dialog: That's all right, really В–
0) 367) dialog: ...Yeah, okay.
0) 370) dialog: It's okay, it's okay.
0) 375) dialog: I'm fine, Charlie. Really I am.  Actually, it's been helpful, but I  guess I should get back to work. Charlie looks at him with some concern, then turns and he for the door.
0) 383) dialog: Looking at the picture. He presses the heels of his hands against his ears.
0) 385) dialog: Head cocked. The surf is mixing into another liquid sound Barton looks sharply around.
0) 388) dialog: After a brief, puzzled look he realizes where the cotton  came from В– and convulsively flips it away.
0) 394) text: As-thoomp!-the heavy volume is deposited across the table in front of Barton, by Mayhew. Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are seated around a picnic tab It is one of a few tables littering the lot of a small st open-air hamburger stand. It is peaceful early evening. The last of the sunlight sl down through palm trees. Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are t only customers at the stand. Mayhew's black Ford stands alone at the edge of the lot. Mayhew leans back in his chair.
0) 399) dialog: Well... actually, no Bill... Barton looks nervously at Audrey before continuing.
0) 400) dialog: ...No, I've always found that writing  comes from a great inner pain. Maybe  it's a pain that comes from a  realization that one must do something  for one's fellow man В– to help somehow  to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a  personal pain. At any rate, I don't  believe good work is possible without  it.
0) 404) dialog: That's true, Bill. I've never found  it to help my writing. Mayhew is becoming testy:
0) 409) dialog: Look, maybe it's none of my business,  but a man with your talent В– don't  you think your first obligation would  be to your gift? Shouldn't you be  doing whatever you have to do to  work again?
0) 411) dialog: I don't know exactly. But I do know  what you're doing with that drink.  You're cutting yourself off from  your gift, and from me and Audrey,  and from your fellow man, and from  everything your art is about.
0) 413) dialog: What's that?
0) 418) dialog: You're lucky she puts up with as  much as she does. Mayhew is getting to his feet.
0) 421) dialog: Watching her go.
0) 425) dialog: He rises.
0) 429) dialog: That son of a bitch... Don't get me  wrong, he's a fine writer. He looks down the road. Mayhew is a small lone figure, we in the dust.
0) 431) dialog: Are you all right? We hear distant bellowing:
0) 433) dialog: Audrey, you can't put up with this. Gradually, she collects herself, wiping her tears.
0) 435) dialog: What?! He's a son of a bitch!
0) 437) dialog: Really?... He considers this for a moment, but his anger returns.
0) 438) dialog: ...Well that doesn't excuse his  behavior.
0) 440) dialog: Okay, but that doesn't excuse his В–
0) 442) dialog: What. What don't I understand? Audrey gazes at him.
0) 456) dialog: Looking quizzically at the page. What's wrong?
0) 458) dialog: He rises and answers the door. Charlie stands smiling in the doorway, holding a pair of  nicely shined shoes.
0) 460) dialog: Hi, Charlie.
0) 462) dialog: Yeah, as a matter of fact they did.  Come on in. The two stocking-footed men go into the room and Barton  reaches under the secretary for Charlie's shoes.
0) 464) dialog: Seems like nothing but, lately. Chalrie perches on the edge of the bed.
0) 466) dialog: Well, my pleasure. I could use a  little lift myself.
0) 470) dialog: Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
0) 475) dialog: Well, it's been better. I can't seem  to get going on this thing. That one  idea, the one that lets you get  started В– I still haven't gotten it.   Maybe I only had one idea in me В– my  play. Maybe once that was done, I  was done being a writer.  Christ, I  feel like a fraud, sitting here  staring at this paper.
0) 477) dialog: How did you know about that?
0) 479) dialog: Yeah, but В–
0) 482) dialog: Where there's life there's hope. Charlie laughs.
0) 484) dialog: And there's hope for you too, Charlie.   Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen  policies.
0) 486) dialog: You're leaving?
0) 488) dialog: I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie.   I'll miss you.
0) 491) dialog: New York can be pretty cruel to  strangers, Charlie. If you need a  home-cooked meal you just look up  Morris and Lillian Fink.  They live  on Fulton Street with my uncle Dave. We hear a tacky, tearing sound. Barton looks toward the door. Charlie rises and walks over to the stand next to where B sits. The two staring men form an odd, motionless tableau В– th slight, bespectacled man seated; the big man standing in hunch with his hands on his thighs; their heads close  together.
0) 497) dialog: I guess the heat's sweating off the  wallpaper.
0) 500) dialog: Well...
0) 502) dialog: What do you mean?
0) 504) dialog: Well, I guess you pick your poison.
0) 506) dialog: Don't pick up and leave without saying  goodbye.
0) 516) dialog: Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
0) 518) dialog: Well I...
0) 520) dialog: Well, to tell you the truth, I'm  having some trouble getting startedВ–
0) 522) dialog: Well not much. Geisler leaps to his feet and paces.
0) 525) dialog: I'm afraid I don't really understand  that genre. maybe that's the prob-
0) 527) dialog: Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
0) 529) dialog: He's a great writer В–
0) 531) dialog: You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
0) 533) dialog: But... I thought no one cared about  this picture.
0) 535) dialog: I don't understand-
0) 537) dialog: I didn't say anything-
0) 539) dialog: I can't write anything by tomorrow.
0) 541) dialog: Well what do I tell him? Geisler rubs a temple, studies Barton for a beat, then pi up a telephone.
0) 575) dialog: Glazed.
0) 583) dialog: Hello, Chet, it's Barton Fink in  605. Can you try a number for me in  Hollywood...  Slausen 6-4304. We pull back to frame in Barton as we hear his call ring  through.  Barton sweats.
0) 584) dialog: Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
0) 586) dialog: Audrey, listen, I need help. I know  it's late and I shouldn't be calling  you like this В– believe me I wouldn't  have if I could see any other  alternative, but I В– I'm sorry - listen, how are you В– I'm sorry. You  doing okay?
0) 588) dialog: Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink. Through the phone, in the background, we hear Mayhew's dr bellowing.
0) 592) dialog: I'm sorry, I just feel like В–I know  I shouldn't ask, I just need some  kind of help, I just, I have a  deadline tomorrow-
0) 596) dialog: If you could, I'd В–
0) 599) dialog: I need help, Audrey.
0) 608) dialog: Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank  you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such  a... Thank you. They enter the main room, where Audrey perches on the edg of the bed.
0) 610) dialog: Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
0) 612) dialog: Well I have to come up with В– an  outline, I'd guess you call it. The  story. The whole goddamn story. Soup  to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
0) 614) dialog: No, but the whole goddamn В– Audrey?   Have you ever had to read any of  Bill's wrestling scenarios? Audrey laughs.
0) 616) dialog: What are they like? What are they  about?
0) 620) dialog: Did what for Bill? Guardedly:
0) 622) dialog: You wrote his scripts for him?
0) 624) dialog: You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus  Christ, you wrote his В– what about  before that?
0) 626) dialog: Before Bill came to Hollywood. Audrey is clearly reluctant to travel this path.
0) 628) dialog: What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey,  how long have you been his...  secretary?
0) 630) dialog: I want to know how many of Bill's  books you wrote!
0) 632) dialog: I want to know!
0) 634) dialog: Hah!
0) 636) dialog: I'll bet. Jesus В– "The grand  productive days." What a goddamn  phony. He resumes pacing.
0) 637) dialog: ...W.P. Mayhew.  William Goddamn  Phony Mayhew. All his guff about  escape. Hah!  I'LL say he escaped! Barton sighs and looks at his watch.
0) 638) dialog: ...Well, we don't have much time. He sits down next to Audrey. Audrey's tone is gentle.
0) 643) dialog: The hum of a mosquito brings us out of the black and we a looking down at Barton, in bed, asleep. It is dawn. Barton's eyes snap open.
0) 645) dialog: Slowly, cautiously, he props himself up, his look followi the sound of the mosquito. His gaze travels down and to one side and is arrested as hum stops.
0) 647) dialog: Gingerly, he reaches over and draws the blanket down Audr back.
0) 651) text: As Barton's hand comes through frame and slaps Audrey's b She doesn't react. Barton draws his hand away. Audrey's back is smeared with blood.
0) 656) dialog: He pulls Audrey's shoulder.
0) 658) dialog: He screams. He screams again. We hear rapid and heavy footfalls next door, a door openi and closing, and then a loud banging on Barton's door.   Barton's head spins towards the door. He is momentarily  frozen. Another knock. Barton leaps to his feet and hurries to the door.
0) 662) dialog: No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
0) 664) dialog: No... no... Barton is nodding as he shuts the door in Charlie's face. He walks back into the room.
0) 666) dialog: He walks toward the bed, wheels before he reaches it, and starts back toward the door. He stops short and turns back again to the room. He avert his eyes В– as it happens, toward the secretary. He walks stiffly over and sits, his back to Audrey.
0) 667) dialog: As he sits in. He stares emptily down at the desk, in sho totally shut down. Behind him, we can see Audrey on the b He stares for a long beat.
