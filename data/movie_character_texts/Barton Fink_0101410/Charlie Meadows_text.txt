0) 172) dialog: Neighbor, I'd feel better about the  damned inconvenience if you'd let me  buy you a drink.
0) 174) dialog: All right, hell, you trying to work  and me carrying on in there. Look,  the liquor's good, wuddya say? As he enters:
0) 175) dialog: ... You got a glass? It's the least  I can do.
0) 177) dialog: Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell,  all the carryings-on next door.
0) 179) dialog: What kind of work do you do, Barton,  if you don't mind my asking?
0) 181) dialog: You don't say. That's a tough racket.  My hat's off to anyone who can make  a go of it. Damned interesting work,  I'd imagine.
0) 183) dialog: Damned difficult, I'd imagine. As he hands Charlie a glass:
0) 185) dialog: Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton,  you might say I sell peace of mind.  Insurance is my game В– door-to-door,  human contact, still the only way to  move merchandise. He fills a glass with whiskey and swaps it for the empty  glass.
0) 186) dialog: ...In spite of what you might think  from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
0) 188) dialog: Hell yes. Because I believe in it.  Fire, theft, and casualty are not  things that only happen to other  people В– that's what I tell 'em.  Writing doesn't work out, you might  want to look into it. Providing for  basic human need В– a fella could do  worse.
0) 190) dialog: What kind of scribbler are you В–  newspaperman did you say?
0) 192) dialog: Pictures! Jesus! He guffaws.
0) 193) dialog: ...I'm sorry, brother, I was just  sitting here thinking I was talking  to some ambitious youngster, eager  to make good.  Hell, you've got it  made! Writing for pictures! Beating  out that competition!  And me being  patronizing! He gestures toward his face:
0) 194) dialog: ...Is the egg showing or what?!
0) 196) dialog: Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm  not the best-read mug on the planet,  so I guess it's no surprise I didn't  recognize your name. Jesus, I feel  like a heel. For the first time Barton smiles.
0) 198) dialog: Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality.   What kind of venue, that is to say,  thematically, uh...
0) 200) dialog: Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah,  that's it, Bart.
0) 202) dialog: Well ain't that a kick in the head!
0) 205) dialog: Hell, I could tell you some storiesВ–
0) 207) dialog: I can see you feel pretty strongly  about it.
0) 209) dialog: I can feel my butt getting sore  already.
0) 211) dialog: And I could tell you some stories В–
0) 213) dialog: Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right  there.
0) 215) dialog: Whatever that means. Barton smiles with him.
0) 217) dialog: Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy,  I'll let you know if I'm bored. I  find it all pretty damned interesting.  I'm the kind schmoe who's generally  interested in the other guy's point  of view.
0) 219) dialog: Well Christ, if there's any way I  can contribute, or help, or whateverВ– Barton chuckles and extends his hand.
0) 221) dialog: Well, I can tell you some stories В– He pumps Barton's hand, then turns and pauses in the door
0) 222) dialog: ...And look, I'm sorry as hell about  the interruption. Too much revelry  late at night, you forget there are  other people in the world.
0) 330) dialog: Howdy, neighbor.
0) 332) dialog: Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting  you again. I heard you walking around  in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
0) 334) dialog: Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic  thing.  Goes away for a while, but  it always comes back. Gotta put cotton  in it to staunch the flow of pus.  Don't worry, it's not contagious.
0) 336) dialog: Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell  me?  Can't trade my head in for a  new one.
0) 338) dialog: Thanks, I'd invite you over to my  place, but it's a goddamn mess. You  married, Bart?
0) 340) dialog: I myself have yet to be lassoed. He takes his flask out.
0) 341) dialog: ...Got a sweetheart?
0) 343) dialog: Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention.  In my experience, they pretend to  give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back В– with  interest. How about family, Bart?   How're you fixed in that department? Barton smiles.
0) 345) dialog: Mine have passed on. It's just the  three of us now... He taps himself on the head, chuckling.
0) 346) dialog: ...What's the expression В– me myself  and I.
0) 348) dialog: Mm... You're no stranger to  loneliness, then. I guess I got no  beef; especially where the dames are  concerned. In my line of work I get  opportunities galore В– always on the  wing, you know what I'm saying. I  could tell stories to curl your hair  В– but it looks like you've already  heard 'em! He laughs at his reference to Barton's curly hair, and pu a dog-eared photograph from his wallet. As he hands it to Barton:
0) 349) dialog: ...That's me in Kansas City, plying  my trade.
0) 351) dialog: ...It was taken by one of my policy  holders. They're more than just  customers to me, Barton.  They really  appreciate what I have to offer them.  Ya see, her hubby was out of town at  the time В–
0) 355) dialog: Not at all. It's damned interesting.
0) 358) dialog: Beery! You got no beef there! He's  good.  Hell of an actor В– though,  for my money, you can't beat Jack  Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff,  funny stuff. But don't get me wrong  В– Beery, a wrestling picture, that  could be a pip. Wrestled some myself  back in school. I guess you know the  basic moves.
0) 360) dialog: Okay, but hell, you should know what  it is. I can show you in about thirty  seconds. He is getting down on his hands and knees.
0) 361) dialog: ...You're a little out of your weight  class, but just for purposes of  demonstration В–
0) 363) dialog: Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest  thing in the world! You just get  down on your knees to my left, slap  your right hand here... He indicated his own right bicep.
0) 364) dialog: ...and your left hand here. He indicated his left bicep. Barton hesitates.
0) 365) dialog: ...You can do it, champ! Barton complies.
0) 366) dialog: ...All right now, when I say "Ready...   wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I  try and pin you. That's the whole  game. Got it?
0) 368) dialog: Ready... wrestle! With one clean move Charlie flips Barton onto his back, h head and shoulders hitting with a thump. Charlie pins Bar shoulders with his own upper body. But before the move even seems completed Charlie is stand again, offering his hand down to Barton.
0) 369) dialog: Damn, there I go again. We're gonna  wake the downstairs neighbors.  I  didn't hurt ya, did I? Barton seems dazed, but not put out.
0) 371) dialog: Well, that's all that wrestling is.  Except usually there's more grunting  and squirming before the pin. Well,  it's your first time. And you're out  of your weight class. Barton has propped himself up and is painfully massaging back of his head. This registers on Charlie.
0) 372) dialog: ...Jesus, I did hurt you! He clomps hurriedly away.
0) 373) dialog: ...I'm just a big, clumsy lug. I  sure do apologize. We hear water running, and Charlie reenters with a wet to Barton accepts the towel and presses it to his head.
0) 374) dialog: ...You sure you're okay? Barton gets to his feet.
0) 376) dialog: Well, it wasn't fair of me to do  that. I'm pretty well endowed  physically. He opens the door.
0) 377) dialog: ...Don't feel bad, though. I wouldn't  be much of a match for you at mental  gymnastics. Gimme a holler if you  need anything. The door closes. Barton crosses to the secretary and sits down, rubbing th back of his head. He rolls up the carriage and looks at t page in the typewriter.
0) 459) dialog: I hope these are your shoes.
0) 461) dialog: Because that would mean they gave  you mine.
0) 463) dialog: Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had  one of those days?
0) 465) dialog: Jesus, what a day. Felt like I  couldn't've sold ice water in the  Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't  want insurance, so okay, that's your  loss. But God, people can be rude.  Feel like I have to talk to a normal  person like just to restore a little  of my...
0) 467) dialog: A little lift, yeah... Smiling, he takes out his flask.
0) 468) dialog: ...Good thing they bottle it, huh  pal? He takes a glass from the bedstand and, as he pours Barto shot:
0) 469) dialog: ...Did I say rude? People can be  goddamn cruel. Especially some of  their housewives. Okay, so I've got  a weight problem. That's my cross to  bear. I dunno...
0) 471) dialog: Defense against what? Insurance?   Something they need? Something they  should be thanking me for offering?  A little peace of mind?... He shakes his head.
0) 472) dialog: ...Finally decided to knock off early,  take your advice. Went to see a doctor  about this. He indicates his ear, still stuffed with cotton.
0) 473) dialog: ...He told me it was an ear infection.   Ten dollars, please. I said, hell, I  told YOU my ear was infected. Why  don't YOU give ME ten dollars? Well,  THAT led to an argument... He gives a rueful chuckle.
0) 474) dialog: ...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if  my problems amounted to a hill of  beans. How goes the life of the mind?
0) 476) dialog: Those two love-birds next door drivin'  you nuts? Barton looks at him curiously.
0) 478) dialog: Know about it? I can practically see  how they're doin' it. Brother, I  wish I had a piece of that.
0) 480) dialog: Seems like I hear everything that  goes on in this dump. Pipes or  somethin'. I'm just glad I don't  have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee  hours. He laughs.
0) 481) dialog: ...Ah, you'll lick this picture  business, believe me. You've got a  head on your shoulders. What is it  they say? Where there's a head,  there's a hope?
0) 483) dialog: That proves you really are a writer! Barton smiles.
0) 485) dialog: Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I  gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
0) 487) dialog: In a few days. Out to your stompin'  grounds as a matter of fact В– New  York City. Things have gotten all  balled up at the Head Office.
0) 489) dialog: Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long  face!  This is still home for me В– I  keep my room, and I'll be back sooner  or later... Barton rises and walks over to his writing table.
0) 490) dialog: ...And В– mark my words В– by the time  I get back you're picture'll be  finished. I know it. Barton scribbles on a notepad and turns to hand it to Cha
0) 493) dialog: (off)
0) 496) dialog: ...Your room does that too?
0) 498) dialog: What a dump... He heads for the door and Barton follows.
0) 499) dialog: ...I guess it seems pathetic to a  guy like you.
0) 501) dialog: Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean  to a guy from New York.
0) 503) dialog: This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
0) 505) dialog: So they say.
0) 507) dialog: Course not, compadre. You'll see me  again. Barton closes the door. He goes back to the desk, sits, and stares at the typewri After a beat he tips back in his chair and looks up at th ceiling. We hear a loud thump.
0) 660) dialog: Are you all right? Barton stares dumbly for a moment.
0) 661) dialog: ...Can I come in?
0) 663) dialog: Are you sure В–
0) 676) dialog: Barton. Are you all right?
0) 678) dialog: Why don't we go to your room-
0) 680) dialog: Get a grip on yourself, brother.  Whatever the problem is, we'll sort  it out.
0) 683) dialog: Don't worry about it, Barton. We can  sort it- He is pushing Barton's door open, but Barton grabs an elb to stop him.
0) 685) dialog: Okay. He turns and pushes open the door.
0) 687) dialog: Jesus... Jesus... Jesus have mercy... His reaction has not encouraged Barton, who is more and m agitated. Charlie emerges from the bathroom, sweating.
0) 688) dialog: ...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is  this?  What're we gonna do?
0) 690) dialog: Hold on В–
0) 692) dialog: Hold on В–
0) 694) dialog: Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath.  Tell me what happened.
0) 696) dialog: I believe you, brother, but this  don't look good.
0) 698) dialog: Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
0) 700) dialog: What do you think happened?
0) 702) dialog: Stop with the police! Wake up, friend!   This does not look good! They hang  people for this!
0) 704) dialog: I believe you В– I KNOW you. But why  should the police? Barton gives him a dumb stare.
0) 705) dialog: ...Did you... Barton, between you  and me, did you have sexual  intercourse? Barton stares at Charlie. He swallows. Charlie shakes his head.
0) 706) dialog: Jesus... They can tell that...
0) 708) dialog: You're in pictures, Barton. Even if  you got cleared eventually, this  would ruin you. He turns and starts toward the bed.
0) 709) dialog: ...Wait in the bathroom.
0) 711) text: Charlie is groping for the front doorknob, cradling the  sheetswaddled body in his arms.
0) 714) dialog: You passed out. Barton looks groggily up.
0) 716) dialog: She's dead, Barton! If that was her  name.
0) 718) dialog: (off)
0) 722) dialog: (off)
0) 762) dialog: Barton. Can I come in? Barton stands back from the door and Charlie picks up his briefcase and enters.
0) 765) dialog: Have to, old timer. Just for a while. Barton sounds desperate:
0) 767) dialog: Everything's okay, believe me. I  know it's rough mentally, but  everything's taken care of.
0) 770) dialog: It's okay... It's okay...
0) 773) dialog: You gotta get a grip on, brother.  You gotta just carry on В– just for a  few days, till I get back. Try and  stay here, keep your door locked.  Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta  keep our heads and we'll figure it  out.
0) 775) dialog: Dammit, don't argue with me. You  asked me to believe you В– well I do.   Now don't argue with me. He looks at Barton for a beat.
0) 776) dialog: ...Look, pal В– can you do something  for me? Charlie hands him his parcel.
0) 777) dialog: ...Keep this for me, till I get back. Barton, snuffling, accepts the package.
0) 778) dialog: ...It's just personal stuff. I don't  wanna drag it with me, but I don't  trust 'em downstairs, and I'd like  to think it's in good hands. Still snuffling:
0) 780) dialog: Funny, huh, when everything that's  important to a guy, everything he  wants to keep from a lifetime В– when  he can fit it into a little box like  that. I guess... I guess it's kind  of pathetic. Wallowing in self-pity:
0) 782) dialog: Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll  bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll  help you finish your script. You'll  think about me... He thumps his chest.
0) 783) dialog: ...Make me your wrestler. Then you'll  lick that story of yours. Barton is tearfully sincere:
0) 785) dialog: Yeah, well, see you soon, friend.  You're gonna be fine. Barton shakes. As they walk to the door:
0) 787) dialog: Don't worry about that, compadre.  I'll be back. Barton shuts the door behind Charlie, locks it, and turns around.
0) 788) text: The room. The bed. The blood-stained mattress. Barton walks across the room and sits carefully at the ed of the bed, avoiding the rust-colored stain. For a long b he sits still, but something is building inside. Finally, when we hear the distant ding of the elevator  arriving for Charlie, it erupts: Barton sobs, with the unself-conscious grief of an abando child.
0) 876) text: Barton typing. The desk trembles under the working of the typewriter.  Charlie's parcel chatters. Barton takes a finished page out of the carriage and plac it face down on the growing stack to his right. He feeds a new page. We hear the muted ding of the elevator down t hall. Barton resumes typing. We hear a knock on Barton's door. Barton does not react,  apparently not hearing.
0) 981) dialog: He leans slowly down to put the briefcase on the floor.
0) 985) dialog: 
0) 991) text: Charlie is charging down the hallway, holding his shotgun loosely in front of his chest, in double-time position. T fire races along with him. He is bellowing:
0) 992) dialog: 
0) 1004) text: Through the open doorway we see Charlie pass, pushing two shells into his shotgun.
0) 1006) dialog: Heil Hitler.
0) 1008) dialog: Tightens a finger over both triggers. He squeezes.
0) 1012) dialog: Barton! He shakes is head and whistles.
0) 1013) dialog: ...Brother, is it hot. He walks into the room.
0) 1015) dialog: How you been, buddy? He props the shotgun in a corner and sits facing Barton, stared at him.
0) 1016) dialog: ...Don't look at me like that,  neighbor.  It's just me В– Charlie.
0) 1018) dialog: Jesus, people can be cruel... He takes a long draught from his flask, then gives a haun stare.
0) 1019) dialog: ...if it's not my build, it's my  personality. Charlie is perspiring heavily. The fire rumbles in the  hallway.
0) 1020) dialog: ...They say I'm a madman, Barton,  but I'm not mad at anyone. Honest  I'm not. Most guys I just feel sorry  for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to  think about what they're going  through. How trapped they are. I  understand it. I feel for 'em. So I  try and help them out... He reached up to loosen his tie and pop his collar button
0) 1021) dialog: ...Jesus. Yeah. I know what it feels  like, when things get all balled up  at the head office. It puts you  through hell, Barton. So I help people  out. I just wish someone would do as  much for me... He stares miserably down at his feet.
0) 1022) dialog: ...Jesus it's hot. Sometimes it gets  so hot, I wanna crawl right out of  my skin. Self-pity:
0) 1024) dialog: Because you DON'T LISTEN! A tacky yellow fluid is dripping from Charlie's left ear running down his cheek.
0) 1025) dialog: ...Jesus, I'm dripping again. He pulls some cotton from his pocket and plugs his ear.
0) 1026) dialog: ...C'mon Barton, you think you know  about pain? You think I made your  life hell?  Take a look around this  dump. You're just a tourist with a  typewriter, Barton. I live here.  Don't you understand that... His voice is becoming choked.
0) 1027) dialog: ...And you come into MY home... And  you complain that I'M making too...  much... noise. He looks up at Barton. There is a long silence. Finally:
0) 1029) dialog: Don't be. He rises to his feet and kneels in front of Barton at the foot of the bed. The two men regard each other. Charlie grabs two bars of the footboard frame, still star at Barton. His muscles tighten, though nothing moves. His neck fans with effort. All of his muscles tense.  His fac is a reddening grimace. With a shriek of protest, the metal gives. The bar to whi Barton is handcuffed had come loose at the top and Barton slides the cuff off it, free. Charlie gets to his feet.
0) 1030) dialog: I'm getting off the merry-go-round. He takes his shotgun and walks to the door.
0) 1031) dialog: ...I'll be next door if you need me. A thought stops him at the door and he turns to face Bart Behind him the hallway blazes.
0) 1032) dialog: ...Oh, I dropped in on your folks.  And Uncle Dave? He smiles. Barton looks at him dumbly.
0) 1033) dialog: ...Good people. By the way, that  package I gave you? I lied. It isn't  mine. He leaves. Barton rises, picks up Charlie's parcel, and his script.
0) 1035) text: Charlie stands in front of the door to his room, his brie dangling from one hand, his other hand fumbling in his po for his key. With his hat pushed back on his head and his shoulders sl with fatigue, he could be any drummer returning to any ho after a long hard day on the road. He opens the door and goes into his room.
