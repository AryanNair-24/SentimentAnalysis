36) 21) dialog: You mean why he crashed the train?
36) 39) dialog: That whole thing's an Air Force train.
37) 3) dialog: I make models-- plastic ones-- you know, glue `em, paint `em--
37) 21) dialog: Air Force trains -- even models -- have these hooks...
37) 26) dialog: Every car in that crash had hooks, every one...
37) 42) dialog: He had a gun, why not use that?
48) 6) dialog: Mostly the Dick Smith Monster Make- up Handbook.
48) 12) dialog: ... sure.
48) 17) dialog: I don't care, they can blow it up. I can show you the train, it's nothing, it's stupid.

48) 35) dialog: Oh my God. That's really good...
48) 38) dialog: ... not bad.
51) 3) dialog: Lucy. Lucy. Lucy!

62) 10) dialog: Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre Dame. I watched that one on TV.
62) 14) dialog: This is the train they wanna destroy.
62) 19) dialog: That's dry brush technique. (off her look) After you've painted the base color, you take something like... (grabs up Testors bottle) Euro Gray.
62) 24) dialog: There are so many different grays, it's crazy. And you pour a little onto like a paper plate. Then you take a dry brush and you just dip it in, then you brush on the paper, so the paint's barely on the brush. Then you make small brush strokes on the model. Little ones, like where the wear and tear would be. Around the wheels. Or where the doors would slide. Then you do it again, like with Camouflage Gray-- or here, I used Insignia Red to make it look like there was another coat of paint on there before. Like they painted over it, but you could see it scratched off.

66) 28) dialog: We just made the discovery ourselves. You understand this is top secret.
66) 32) dialog: I would never have given you this information if you and I hadn't served together in Vietnam.
71) 6) dialog: We're not clear.
71) 11) dialog: We're not clear. You and I aren't clear about anything. We couldn't be less clear.
71) 15) dialog: 
71) 21) dialog: She's NICE to me!
77) 5) dialog: Before, earlier, b-- no, you okay?
77) 9) dialog: 
77) 16) dialog: Room's still messy.
77) 25) dialog: He can be sorta li-- I've known him since Kindergarten, though--
77) 30) dialog: -- no, I totally do, I'm just... sort of in shock at this whole
77) 40) dialog: ... yeah...
77) 43) dialog: ... it's so weird watching her like this, like she's still here... (beat, lost in it) ... she used to look at me, this way... like really look. And I just... knew I was there. That I existed.
