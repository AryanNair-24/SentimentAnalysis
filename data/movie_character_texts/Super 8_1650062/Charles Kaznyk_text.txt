22) 5) dialog: Alice: Mrs. Hathaway really doesn't want her husband to keep investiga--
22) 9) dialog: Okay, I'm just directing. Martin get on your mark. Martin, you're going to have to reassure her. Do you know what "reassure her" means?
22) 13) dialog: Okay-- we're starting on Alice's side first-- Preston: a couple seconds after "action" walk to the pay phone, make it look like this place is busy--
22) 18) dialog: Asshole, could you stop blowing shit up for two seconds and deal with the camera?
22) 22) dialog: Let's rehearse this -- save your real performances for when we're filming, though.

31) 60) dialog: We can use this -- we can film it --
31) 64) dialog: (turns to him) --okay-- Holy shit, that's mint. You're a total brain--! We gotta get the camera fixed and the film developed from last night-- I gotta go steal some more money from my mom!
32) 3) dialog: If any of the footage from last night is usable, that means we need Alice to play the wife again.
32) 7) dialog: She was mint, but she's never gonna do it.
32) 12) dialog: There's no way. You heard what she said.
32) 16) dialog: You honestly think she cares about the scenes?
33) 3) dialog: Man, did you hear what she said last night? "I never should have done this!" Dude, she was totally wigged!
33) 7) dialog: Did you see her face?

34) 9) dialog: 
34) 27) dialog: We need this developed as soon as possible -- can you do overnight? 39.
34) 33) dialog: ... no, thank you.
34) 42) dialog: Well, what's the fastest you can do?
34) 46) dialog: I don't know.
36) 3) dialog: CUT! That was mint! So good! And it looked huge with the train! Wow! Joe: go reload the cap gun!
36) 9) dialog: We'll get the other direction next - - Alice, that was mint-- Martin, go a little faster next time. 42.
36) 34) dialog: -- dude, what are you doing?
37) 10) dialog: Thanks, could I have a coffee, please? Cream on the side?
37) 28) dialog: Joe: stop talking about it.
37) 38) dialog: Please shut up, all of you.
37) 58) dialog: 
37) 65) dialog: Funny, Chompers, at least I don't use a booster seat.
37) 69) dialog: I don't wanna find out -- guys, we gotta forget we were there. Joe, seriously... you really wanna take a chance that something could happen to your dad, too?
48) 9) dialog: Hey! So I'm gonna need more shots of the train crash, obviously-- you know that train model you made? Can we blow it up and film it?
55) 5) dialog: I don't wanna hear about it. They could be monitoring us right now! Jesus, shut up. Over!
55) 10) dialog: Joe -- YOU CAN NOT FLAKE OUT ON ME AND BE A DICK! Are you gonna come help me tomorrow or not? I need you to make Alice a zombie again.

66) 23) dialog: 
68) 3) dialog: Joe.
68) 10) dialog: Uh-- Mr. Lamb? That's your camera, but technically, that's my film-- 68.
90) 6) dialog: I told you not to pick it up in the first place.
90) 10) dialog: That's part of it! Juts a part!
91) 5) dialog: My whole movie's a disaster `cause of you!
91) 10) dialog: Whatever.
91) 14) dialog: It's not about the movie.
91) 18) dialog: Just forget it.
91) 22) dialog: There's nothing wrong--
92) 5) dialog: It's not about the movie.
92) 9) dialog: Jesus, you don't even get it do you? It's obvious.
92) 13) dialog: Gawd, you're a dumb ass. 80.
93) 3) dialog: That night of the crash, you started getting all weird.
93) 7) dialog: Like Mr. Attitude all of a sudden.
93) 11) dialog: Don't pretend like you did it for me! You didn't do it for me and you know it!
93) 16) dialog: It was never about me! It was always about Alice!
93) 27) dialog: Not so you could fall in love with her!
93) 32) dialog: Because I like her! That's why! That's why I asked her in the first place! So I could get to know her, not YOU!
93) 36) dialog: You're such an idiot.
93) 41) dialog: SHIT! Look at all that smoke! We can't use any of this. And you won't even let me blow up your train. Everything's bogus.
93) 55) dialog: I know it's stupid. What would she ever like me? I haven't leaned out yet, which the doctor says is gonna
93) 60) dialog: -- Joe, what the hell--?!
95) 3) dialog: You see your family anywhere? -- no, you see your dad? -- no...
99) 6) dialog: They made us get on the bus.
99) 13) dialog: You gonna tell him about that thing?
101) 5) dialog: Do this for me and I'll babysit the twins next week so you can go to Wendy's stupid party.
101) 8) dialog: I am not shitting you. You can't ask me any questions though. You can't tell anyone. I'm serious. No one.
101) 12) dialog: Yes or no, you ugly freak. I'm about to rescind the offer.
103) 17) dialog: You think Woodward's got information about that thing in the dungeon?
111) 8) dialog: I was thinking about that too.
111) 12) dialog: Yeah, Woodward has all kinds of weird stuff in the dungeon.
111) 18) dialog: I don't care. Disco I guess?
113) 6) dialog: Joe, let me try -- let me try.

113) 13) dialog: --I loosened it for you.
114) 3) dialog: I cannot believe we're breaking into school, who does that? No one does that-- idiots do that--
115) 9) dialog: Back when he was like Middle-Aged Man Woodward.
115) 15) dialog: I don't know. It says April 8th, 1963 incident. I dunno.
115) 47) dialog: He was trying to help it escape.
117) 3) dialog: -- oh shit!
122) 13) dialog: ... what... what's gonna happen?
122) 23) dialog:
