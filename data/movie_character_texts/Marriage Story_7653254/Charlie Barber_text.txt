10) 21) dialog: If he stays out here and I stay in New York, that’s just, then I won’t, I’ll never get to really be his parent again.
10) 23) dialog: It won’t exist! 101.
10) 25) dialog: Fuck the space, Bert. FUCK THE SPACE.

10) 233) dialog: You USED me so you could get out of LA.
10) 234) dialog: I didn’t use you-- You did and then you BLAMED me for it. You always made me aware of what I was doing wrong, how I was falling short.

10) 239) dialog: No! But she didn’t hate me. You hated me.
10) 241) dialog: You stopped having sex with me in the last year. I never cheated on you.

I was hot shit—-and I wanted to fuck EVERYBODY and I didn’t. And I loved you and didn’t want to lose you...and I’m in my twenties and I didn’t want to lose that too. And you wanted SO much so fast...I didn’t even want to get married...and fuck it, there’s so much I DIDN’T do.
10) 245) dialog: You’re welcome. You’re...welcome. Nicole stamps her feet and shakes her fists like a child having a tantrum.
10) 248) dialog: You’re fucking insane! Charlie raises his arm and punches the wall. The cheap dr wall cracks and chips.
10) 249) dialog: And you're fucking winning. 124.
10) 251) dialog: (pause) What does that have to do with LA? Nicole stares at him, incredulous.
10) 252) dialog: What? You’re so merged with your own selfishness that you don’t even identify it as selfishness anymore. YOU'RE SUCH A DICK.
10) 253) dialog: Every day I wake up and hope you’re dead-- Dead like-- And then Charlie starts crying.
10) 254) dialog: (through tears) If I could guarantee Henry would be OK, I’d hope you get an illness and then get hit by a car and DIE. He sinks down, weeping. All this vitriol has taken its toll. Nicole watches, taken aback. She walks over and gently puts her hand on his shoulder. He shakes and cries
10) 256) dialog: I’m sorry.
10) 260) dialog: We'll have to return some of this stuff so don’t get too used to it.

10) 305) dialog: Charlie is cooking an elaborate dinner. The bell rings. He takes a deep breath. He glances into Henry’s room. He’s playing by himself on the floor. He walks through the set-decorated living room which look relatively homey, full of warmth and board games and pictures of Charlie and Henry. Charlie opens the door. A diminutive woman with frizzy hair is staring at the door across the hall. She startles turns around and smiles and puts out her hand.
10) 307) dialog: (shaking) Hi, I’m Charlie Barber. Nancy, can I get you anything?

10) 348) dialog: You’re welcome. But you’re getting really good at it.
10) 350) dialog: Well, you are, but... Charlie exits.
10) 357) dialog: Sweetheart, do you want to help me set the table.
10) 359) dialog: Just come in here and grab a plate and--
10) 361) dialog: Henry! HENRY’S ROOM Henry plays with his men on the floor. The evaluator sits in a chair nearby.
10) 364) dialog: Why are you being like this?
10) 366) dialog: If I ask you to help out, help out.
10) 368) dialog: It’s special meal.
10) 370) dialog: It’s just a garnish.
10) 371) dialog: Here, I’1ll take it off.
10) 373) dialog: It doesn’t change the taste of anything.
10) 375) dialog: Is she a vegetarian now?
10) 377) dialog: (prickly) Well, then you should like garnish. It’s all garnish, vegetarianism. 136. Charlie looks over. Nancy stands, watching, in the threshold of the kitchen.
10) 380) dialog: You sure you don’t want anything?
10) 383) dialog: No...I’m not...no.
10) 385) dialog: It’s not a dinner thing. Silence.

10) 404) dialog: Right and then just do the rest of it. 138.
10) 406) dialog: No! You have “Tuh” and “ime.” What is that? Henry takes a piece of tape and puts it on his mouth.
10) 407) dialog: Time. It’s time. He looks at the evaluator. She nods. Henry rolls over onto his front, playing dead.
10) 408) dialog: You’1l see, honey, one day it’s just going to click and you’1l be able to read everything.
10) 410) dialog: Sure. Charlie tries to kiss him on lips. Henry gives him his head. Charlie kisses the top of his head. Henry runs out. Nancy is looking at the crack in the wall from Charlie’s punch. Charlie clocks this. Silence.
10) 411) dialog: Do you ever observe married people?
10) 413) dialog: I was kidding.
10) 415) dialog: The knife thing is, I carry this knife on my keychain which his mother got me actually-- 139. He takes out his key-ring and shows her the X-Acto knife.

10) 417) dialog: Where I pretend to cut myself, but I retract the blade-- He pantomimes cutting his arm.
10) 418) dialog: But I don’t do it with him... The evaluator stares at Charlie with horror. Charlie hesitates and follows her gaze. Dark red blood streams down his arm.
10) 419) dialog: Oh...that’s fine. It’s really bleeding. He covers it with his hand, the blood spreading between his fingers.
10) 421) dialog: (casually) Yeah, I must not have retracted the blade all the way.

He finds a small box of band-aids in the cupboard and ope about seven of them and tries to cover up the wound. But it’s still really bleeding. He wraps his arm in paper towels, sweat now sliding down his face and soaking his armpits. He drops to the kitchen floor and lies down on his back in exhaustion and pain. Two small bare feet step over him and pad over to the refrigerator.

The group of people watching includes kids and an agent, cast and crew from her show and family -- it’s a housewarming party. (The house looks very different from the home she shared with Charlie.
