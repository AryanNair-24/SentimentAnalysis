1) 27) dialog: --you know I can’t cry on stage and I know you don’t like when I fake it, but I thought maybe it would come tonight. But it didn’t... He flips through the notebook. Silence.
1) 29) dialog: Goodnight Charlie. She starts crying as soon as she turns away from him. We MOVE with her as she cries through the apartment to their bedroom. She trips briefly on one of her suitcases also lying on the floor open and half-packed. She removes her shoes, but not her clothes, and gets into bed, crying. Fade to Black. A curtain flies open revealing a rich blue sky and swayin palm trees. The light is painfully bright. We hear a female voice lightly singing:
1) 33) dialog: Mom... (tired) G-ma summer is for relaxing.
1) 35) dialog: What do you want to do today?
1) 36) dialog: Hang out and relax with you. (nuzzling him) Me too.
1) 43) dialog: It’s just for now, while we go through this transition. Shit, don’t tell Charlie when he gets here -- he hates co-sleeping. Nicole climbs out of bed. Her pillow is stained with blac eye make-up.

1) 60) dialog: Yeah-- (accommodating) Or I can go once with you and once with Daddy because I wouldn’t mind going twice anyway-- 22.
1) 62) dialog: On the plane, I re-read the pilot as if I were Charlie reading it and I started to think it’s just bad.
1) 64) dialog: (to Henry) This coffee IS good. Thank you. (to Sandra) What if Charlie’s on Broadway with the play I brought him--which I originated and I’m just doing bad TV.
1) 70) dialog: Can I say something? No one answers. We hear bits of side-conversations about book club book they’re all reading.
1) 77) dialog: What do you mean? Like down here?
1) 81) dialog: I can’t hold a baby like this.
1) 85) dialog: Ha. You should have seen me before the plants invaded.
1) 91) dialog: (louder) Can I say something? ‘bout here? her mask and applies
1) 95) dialog: She has to know how to hold a baby. Later after she kills Donny, she becomes this sort of earth mother for the plant community and that won’t make sense if we think she’s a bad mother to her own kid.
1) 97) dialog: You don’t want her to appear unsympathetic this early in the show, do you?
1) 99) dialog: Also, why does she kill Donny anyway?
1) 102) dialog: Well, I’m from out here-- She's says it went up toa hundred and four the other day--
1) 103) dialog: We're just so excited to (nods ) have you. I’m excited to be here --
1) 111) dialog: Carol-- Yeah.
1) 114) dialog: Nice to meet you. So, is it?
1) 115) dialog: What? Accurate?
1) 120) dialog: Oh...good, you know, I just thought-
1) 122) dialog: (surprises herself even) Or I could direct? Sorry, maybe that sounds crazy.
1) 124) dialog: No, because I’ve never done it. I mean, I watched my husband do it for years... (quietly) Almost ex-husband? What’s the opposite of fiance?
1) 126) dialog: At our theater, I always wanted to direct and Charlie would say something like “The next one!” But he was always the director and there never was a next one. (contradicting herself) But I don’t know, maybe there would have been if we stayed married. You know, I don’t know. Nicole turns away, embarrassed. The Female Producer has been watching her, while the Male Producer is just textin like a motherfucker. 28. INT. NICOLE’S TRAILER Nicole enters the cramped space and realizes the Female Producer is right behind her. Nicole tries to busy herself.
1) 128) dialog: Oh...OK. Is it a therapist? I have a therapist. Well, she’s my mom’s therapist. We share her.
1) 131) dialog: And you still work together? That’s nice.

1) 143) dialog: Oh...great. Thank you. Fantastic. You’re awesome.
1) 144) dialog: (almost apologetically) Charlie directed it.
1) 146) dialog: He is. They’re moving it to Broadway. Without me of course.
1) 147) dialog: He was lucky to have you. While I’m making a show about a plant invasion. 30.
1) 152) dialog: (likes this) Oh, I understand. An assistant enters with a tray that has green tea and cookies. Nicole starts eating the cookies, Nora does not.
1) 154) dialog: (hopeful) Yes. I have a kid from my You do? ex who was a narcissistic artist and verbally abusive. I’m now with a great boyfriend, who lives in Malibu. 31.
1) 155) dialog: Oh, good. (hesitates) But Charlie’s not terrible.
1) 158) dialog: (takes a breath) Well, I’m here now, obviously, and I don’t know if this show will be picked up, but... it feels like home... it is home. It’s the only home I’ve known without Charlie.
1) 160) dialog: Charlie won’t want to do that. He hates LA.
1) 162) dialog: (nods ) He always said we would, but we never did.
1) 164) dialog: Henry is eight. He likes LA, but I don’t know if it’s fair to him... 32.
1) 166) dialog: (to herself) The second half... Nicole processes this.
1) 168) dialog: (suddenly meaning it) You're saying, I want Yes. something better for myself.
1) 169) dialog: I do. And this, right now, is the worst time. It will only get better. Wasn’t it Tom Petty who said the waiting is the hardest part?
1) 170) dialog: I don’t know. I represented his wife in their divorce, I got her half of that song.
1) 171) dialog: Oh, I don’t want money or anything, he doesn’t have money anyway, he puts it all back into the theater-- I used to think he gave TOO much away. I just want it to be over.
1) 173) dialog: I just worry... You know we weren't going to even use lawyers so...I don’t want to be too aggressive. I’d like to stay friends. 33.
1) 175) dialog: It’s difficult to articulate. Sorry. It’s like I know why I’m doing this but I don’t know too. It’s not as simple as not being in love anymore.
1) 177) dialog: Well, I was engaged to Ben, you know, and living in LA and I felt like “Yes, I want to make movies and marry Ben” - Jesus I was only nineteen or twenty, I’ve never felt older in my whole life - But if I was honest with myself, there was a small part of me that felt dead, or dead-ish, but you tell yourself “no one is perfect, no relationship is perfect.” (realizing) Boy, this tea is delicious.
1) 179) dialog: Anyway, you were asking about Charlie. So yes, so I was happy with Ben, but aware of the deadness. (MORE )
1) 181) dialog: And then I went to New York to meet a director for a space movie, but one where they take space seriously. Sex trafficking in space. It was political, or they wanted us to think it was. It was actually just fulfilling the same need certain fucked up porn does. Anyway, while I was there, the producer invited me to a play. It was in someone’s living room with all the lights on and like nothing I'd ever seen before. A strange, surreal dystopian story. So well acted and one of the actors was this big shaggy bear who played all his lines looking directly at me which I knew couldn't be really the case, but it felt that way, and of course later I learned that it was. (also realizing) The cookies are really great too.
1) 183) dialog: Afterwards, I was introduced to the cast and this bear turned out to also be the director. He didn’t really know who I was - or he did, or he figured it out later - and that was it. He started talking to me. And I talked back - and the dead part wasn’t dead, it was just in a coma. And it was better than sex, the talking. Although the sex was also like the talking... everything is like everything ina relationship, do you find that? ... We spent the whole night and next day together, and I just... never left. And to be honest, all the problems were there in the beginning, too. I just went along with him in his life because it felt so damn good to feel myself alive. In the beginning I was the actress, the star, so that felt like something. People came to see me, at first. (MORE )
1) 185) dialog: But then the farther away I got from that and the more the theatre company got acclaim, I had less and less weight. I became “Who?” “Oh you remember, that actress who was in that thing that time.” And he was the draw. And that would have been fine, but...I got smaller. I realized that I didn’t really ever come alive for myself, I was just feeding his aliveness. He was so smart and creative, it didn’t matter. I would tell him things at home, in private, and then they would work their way into public conversation, into his work and for a while that felt like enough. I was just so flattered that someone like him would find an idea of mine worth using or a comment of mine worth repeating. And then I got pregnant. And I thought “having a baby will be ours, really ours, and it will also really be mine” and he was so excited. And it was nice for a while. But kids... they belong to themselves. Like the instant they leave your body, it’s just a process of going away from you. And I didn’t belong to myself. It was stupid stuff and big stuff-- All of the furniture in our house was his taste. I wasn’t even sure what my taste was anymore because I'd never been asked to use it. I didn’t even pick our apartment, I just moved into his. I made noises about wanting to move back to LA, but it came to nothing. We’d come here on holidays because he liked my family, but whenever I suggested we do a year or something, he’d put me off. It would be so weird if he had turned to me and said “And what do you want to do today?” I watched that long documentary about George Harrison and I thought “just own it, own it like George Harrison's wife. Being a wife and mother is enough.” And then I realized I couldn’t remember her name. (MORE )
1) 188) dialog: So this pilot came along, and it shot in LA and it paid so much and it was like there was a little life- line thrown to me “Here is a bit of earth that’s yours.” And I was embarrassed about it in front of him, but also, it felt like “this is who I am, this is what I’m worth and it’s stupid, but at least it’s mine.” And if he had taken me in a big hug and said “Baby, I’m so excited for your adventure and of course I want you to have your own piece of earth” then we might not be getting divorced. But he made fun of it. And was jealous, like he is. BUT then he realized about the money and told me I could funnel it back into the theatre company. And that’s when I realized that he truly didn’t see me. He didn’t see me as something separate from him. And I asked him to say my phone number. And he didn’t know it. So I left. Nora wipes a ink-stained tear from Nicole’s cheek and hug her.
1) 189) dialog: (realizing she forgot to include) I think Charlie also slept with Mary Ann, the stage manager.
1) 193) dialog: So, Cassie, you’re going to hand him the envelope--
1) 197) dialog: No. Mom. Legally I can’t be the one who serves him.
1) 199) dialog: Yes, but I’m going to tell him in advance that they’re divorce papers. Nora says it doesn’t have to be so formal. (suddenly nervous) Where’s Henry? Nicole finishes what’s in her glass and pours herself mor
1) 201) dialog: Let’s get them upstairs. So, I’1l tell Charlie what’s happening and Cassie, you can then hand him the envelope-- 38.
1) 203) dialog: What do you mean, like take it back?
1) 205) dialog: (getting anxious) I think so.
1) 207) dialog: I’m not going to change my mind.
1) 209) dialog: Now you're both just making ME feel bad about it, OK.
1) 211) dialog: (with more power now) You have to STOP loving him, Mom. You can’t be his friend anymore.
1) 216) dialog: (getting emotional, but staying strong) Listen, nothing can be independent of our marriage right now. I can’t believe I have to explain this to you. Just be on MY side,
1) 221) dialog: Cassie, you’re the server.
1) 224) dialog: It’s not an audition.
1) 228) dialog: We don’t need to practice it. It’s not a performance! working on opening a bottle of wine.
1) 229) dialog: Did we finish the other one already? 40.
1) 231) dialog: OK, let me get it. You both go in the other room. Cassie, make sure Henry goes upstairs with Jules and Molly.
1) 233) dialog: Mom!
1) 235) dialog: What?!
1) 237) dialog: Can we transfer him to the upstairs one?
1) 239) dialog: OK, grab him when he comes out. (Cassie nods and starts to leave) Cassie!
1) 241) dialog: (re: Nora’s legal document ) (MORE )
1) 243) dialog: I’m putting the envelope here by the toaster.
1) 246) dialog: He’s pooping.
1) 250) dialog: 
1) 253) dialog: Oh, Charlie, that’s so great. Congratulations! She hugs him, truly happy for him.
1) 254) dialog: Thanks. (so pleased) I’ll say it because you can’t, it’s the genius grant. You’re a genius. 42.
1) 255) dialog: (bashful, but beaming) I’m really happy for you. Well... You deserve it--
1) 257) dialog: Well, thank you, but it’s yours, Charlie, enjoy it.
1) 260) dialog: (eyes on the envelope) It’s so great.
1) 262) dialog: No!
1) 263) dialog: We just started rehearsals You always don’t know at again...I don’t know... this point and then it gets there--
1) 265) dialog: I know, but it’s true. It’1l be great.
1) 267) dialog: Tell them Hi. I miss everyone.
1) 268) dialog: Well, you’ll see them when A MacArthur, Broadway, it’s you come back-- so exciting. Congratulations, Charlie. He picks at the chicken with his hands, licking his fingers. Nicole takes a breath, wanting to acknowledge th envelope sitting now to Charlie’s right and all that’s about to happen.
1) 270) dialog: What? Is he pooping? He starts He knocks
1) 271) dialog: Oh...downstairs. off. She follows him into the other room.

1) 296) dialog: 
1) 304) dialog: I hear him! What's going on, Henry?!
1) 307) dialog: (mouths ) Wait for me-- Charlie continues to eat (and mangle) his chicken. Cassie stands in front of him awkwardly. She collects her things holds a pie tin, on top of a script. She’s red faced and blushing, and shaking from nerves.
1) 327) dialog: (to Cassie) What did you do?
1) 329) dialog: I was going to warn you. So it didn’t become a thing. Charlie stares at the envelope. And then:
1) 330) dialog: I’m sorry. 48.
1) 332) dialog: We don’t have a marriage anymore. Charlie looks up at her.
1) 333) dialog: I know you don’t want the disruption, but you don’t want to be married. Not really.
1) 335) dialog: Well, what did you expect was going to happen?
1) 337) dialog: We weren’t going to use I want a... I don’t know, lawyers. I’m trying to say this as undramatically as possible. I want an ENTIRELY different kind of life.
