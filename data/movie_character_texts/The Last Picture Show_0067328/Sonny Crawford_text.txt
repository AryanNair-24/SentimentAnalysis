1) 0) text: cold, windy morning in Texas. Except for one car -- an old white Nash that belongs to ANDY FANNER, the night- watchman, the square is deserted. Wind blows the curling dust down the empty main street, past the picture show, a laundry, a dinky beauty parlor, a grocery store. A black Chevrolet pickup, vintage 1941, is coughing its way up the long road toward the square. ’S PI iP Cl CITY SQUAR: — DAWN 2 SONNY CRAWFORD riddles intently with the choke, trying to keep the pickup running. The radio is on but the sound of the motor all but drowms it out. In front of the picture show, the pickup dies and the popular 1951 song fills the cab. Sonny relaxes, yawns, peers at the movie posters a moment. (He wears a Levi jacket and his hair is neatly combed -- except for a cowlick at the back, which sticks straight up; now and then, he tries to smoot it down.) Before hitting the starter again, he blows into his hands. The pickup grinds for a minute, then kicks off -- Sonny races the engine before moving on. At the red light he looks over at Fanner, who is asleep in the front seat; his feet, in heavy brogans, are visible, propped on the dashboard, A pickup with three horses in it goes through the light. Sonny starts to turn toward the pool- hall, but far down the street sees a figure sweeping, and drives that way instead. BILLY is sweeping down the white line, toward the city limits sign, ribbons of dust around the broom. (He too wears a frayed Levi jacket -- also an old red baseball cap.) Sonny pulls up beside him and taps his horn. Billy looks up, grins happily, trots around and gets into the cab. Sonny makes a sweeping U-turn, reaches over and turns Billy’s cap around backwards. Billy grins. The song is over and an announcer comes on: COTTONSEED CLARK (v.o.) Folks, ol’ Cottonseed Clark talkin’ at you -- we’ll get some more good music out to you in a minute but first let me say a word or two about these wonderful Purina Poultry Chows...
1) 7) dialog: (munching candy) Coulda been worse. Sonny idly takes a cue stick, as the sound of very loud MUFFLERS is HEARD. Billy looks nervously outside as Sonny does.
3) 2) dialog: Sounds too rough for me. Abilene comes in, gives them a nod, unzips his cover- alls and hangs them on a nail. (His flannel shirt has pearl buttons, and his gabardine pants are well- pressed.) Billy begins to sweep along one side of the poolhall, restlessly.
3) 5) dialog: (glancing at : Abilence) i Don‘t know -~
3) 7) dialog: (nods) The truck’s bein’ greased. Sam reaches beneath the counter and lays Abilence’s ivory-banded, jointed cue on the counter. Abilene lays his sunglasses on the counter and Sam automatically puts them in a drawer.
3) 16) text: | You’re a damn sight more dangerous 1 in a poolhall than you are on a foolball field. Ever heard of tackling? Sonny puts up his cue. Abilene breaks a rack of red- balls, moves smoothly around the table. Sam starts to cough again and Sonny goes out.

TWO COWBOYS are sitting at the counter, a DRILLER with a toothpick in his mouth is at the cash register, and some ROUGHNECKS occupy two of the booths. Duane tosses the sack one final time, but in catching it Sonny almost runs into GENEVIEVE, carry- ing several plates of sausage and eggs in her hands. Stepping back, the swinging door to the kitchen hits her on the behind; she fixes them with a fond but stern eye.
3) 31) dialog: We coulda run off to Mexico with this, you know. The boys laugh and stand in front of the jukebox as =, Genevieve waits on tables. Sonny tosses a quarter up i and catches it, studying the selections. When he tos- ~ ses it up again, Genevieve catches it.

3) 45) dialog: (noticing the cowboy ) Be lucky to get back in time for the second show. Duane follows Sonny’s look to the cowboy, whose expres-— sion is somber, almost grave. After another silent moment, he shakes his head, says "Tsk," returns the toothpick to his mouth, and walks on out, never once changing his expression. The boys look at each other hopelessly.
