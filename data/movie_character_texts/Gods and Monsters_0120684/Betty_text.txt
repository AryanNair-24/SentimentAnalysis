35) 9) dialog: Sure.  Your friend want one?
35) 14) dialog: (to Harry) I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
35) 17) dialog: Sounds screwy to me.  I can't imagine a real artist wanting to spend time looking at that kisser.
35) 20) text: Betty glares at Clay, who realizes he's gone too far.
35) 21) dialog: I bet this is just some fruit pretending to be famous.  So he can get in the big guy's pants.
35) 24) dialog: Just thinking out loud.
35) 26) dialog: All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.

43) 1) dialog: Weird movie.  Weird, weird, weird.
43) 4) dialog: Weird.
43) 13) text: He waits to see how Betty reacts.  She shrugs.  Harry tak his book and cash drawer to the back door.
43) 17) dialog: (laughs) What's to be jealous of?
43) 19) dialog: Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
43) 25) dialog: It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
43) 27) dialog: Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.

44) 14) dialog: It still hurt.  A lot.

44) 18) dialog: Sure.  I loved it.
44) 20) dialog: You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
44) 22) text: Betty bursts out laughing.
44) 23) dialog: The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
44) 25) dialog: What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
44) 28) dialog: Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
44) 31) dialog: Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
44) 33) text: Betty quickly gets into the car.  before she can pull the door shut, Clay slams it on her, hard.  Her hands leap in front of her face, as if he'd hit her.  The look of fear her eyes startles Clay out of his rage.
44) 36) dialog: From here on out, Boone, you're just another tired old face on the other side of the bar.
