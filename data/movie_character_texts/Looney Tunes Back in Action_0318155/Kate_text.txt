Kate awakens in time to see she the preciptious drop to the ground. She struggles. Mr. Smith seems annoyed, but reaches for the helicopter ladder. A metal replica of the Eifel Tower hits him in the back of the head. He turns to see that: DJ is buying one model after another from a SALESGIRL and hurling them at him. Mr. Smith bats off the metal models like flies.
91) 2) text: Kate hurtles to her death, screaming through the tape. DJ falls through the air. He takes out his cell phone. Kate still hurtles, still screams. DJ pushes a button on the cell phone.

She points to a large tessellation on the wall (or floor?) made of identical monkey shapes and forming one large monkey shape. Kate puts on the ring and inserts the monkey in an empty space in the center of the mosaic. With an ANCIENT CREAKING SOUND the monkey-shaped mosaic emerges from the wall. Kate is taken aback momentarily. On a hunch, she turns her fist. The monkey ring turns the monkey mosaic like a key; it rotates clockwise. The ground TREMBLES. Everyone turns in half-horror to see what happens next. In front of them, a spectacular achievement in set direction unfolds. The wall behind the pedestal lowers down, forming a bridge across a molten lava moat to: EXT. MONKEY ALTAR — CONTINUOUS 194 It's really something. You should see the drawings. They stare in awe.
