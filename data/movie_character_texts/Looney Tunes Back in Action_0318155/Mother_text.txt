60) 5) dialog: Hello, DJ. I’m Mother. You can * call me Mom. * Mother turns and beckons them to follow. Robby sucks the puddle of Daffy up with a turkey baster. They start walking.
61) 0) text: Mother leads them past giant, high-tech fishbowls, Mason jars, etc., holding various space aliens.
61) 2) dialog: No. Area 51 is a paranoid fantasy * we concocted to hide the real * identity of this facility.
61) 6) dialog: Area 52. But don’t quote me on that. The four are led past a large black granite plaque which reads, “Area 52” with the legend, “Keeping things from * the American People Since 1947.” * Daffy’s eyeballs float around in the turkey baster Robby is holding. Kate seems worried about it.

61) 28) dialog: It needs updating, but you get the idea. *
61) 30) dialog: (shrugs ) Again. DJ is lost in the repercussions of it all. PULL BACK to reveal Bugs, next to DJ in a parody of his thinking pose.
61) 42) dialog: (scornful) You want to take over your father’s mission? (then) I guess that would be okay.
61) 44) dialog: (very casual) How many people would notice if you vanished? (then, to DJ) I have to warn you, DJ, you'll be going up against a evil cabal bent on world domination...
61) 46) dialog: <you-gotta-be-kidding sound> Mother pushes a button and a wall behind opens, revealing a dazzling array of gadgetry: laser cannons, floating orbs, high-tech propeller beanies, etc.
61) 48) dialog: None of that stuff works. The door closes. Mother directs DJ to a small table. (CONTINUED)
61) 52) dialog: Cost a fortune, too. Okay, now I’m going to talk pretty fast because this part’s boring... Mother picks up a cellphone. (Off to the left side of the screen, Bugs takes this opportunity to catch up on his personal grooming: brushes teeth, flosses, combs face...) MOTHER (CONT’D) Looks like an ordinary cellphone... Kate pulls out her cellphone. The two phones are virtually identical. Mother puts the cellphone in DJ’s hand, pushes buttons as she ticks off features.

61) 64) dialog: Guys in the lab spent way too much time on that.
63) 4) dialog: Standard pleated front, but with liquid hydrogen pocket rockets here and here... She points to the back pockets, then moves on. She picks up a handheld device shaped-like a nose. (Daffy tapes his head back on with duct tape.) (CONTINUED)
65) 2) dialog: You have the playing card? DJ pulls it out.
65) 4) dialog: (rote) Well, that’s the window into what lies behind her smile.
65) 8) dialog: As a super spy, you’re supposed to be able to figure the rest out. Sorry. Suddenly, the double doors HISS open. Gobs of aliens and monsters struggle to cram through the door!
