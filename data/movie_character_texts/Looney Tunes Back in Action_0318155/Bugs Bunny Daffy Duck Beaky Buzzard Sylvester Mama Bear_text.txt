68) 7) dialog: That’s more like it. Our heroes turn to retreat, only to discover that the Mutant, Daleks and Space Gorilla (putting his head back on) are right behind them. Thinking fast, Bugs zips over to Robby the Robot and hits him with the back of his fist. Robby lights up and begins playing the Bruce Johnston’s 1962 surf hit, “Moon Shot.” The aliens look momentarily confused, then start to dance. Kate is about to be hugged by the Space Gorilla again, when DJ grabs her hand and pulls her into a dance. She is momentarily shocked, but then smiles. DJ spins and swings Kate around; with each big movement, the duo kick and punch the aliens. Meanwhile, Bugs sits atop the Mutant, who he is making do the Watusi.

76) 21) dialog: Queen of diamonds is your card! Just put it back into the pack. Anywhere is fine. Bugs hands Elmer the card and fans out a deck. Elmer, confused, puts the Queen into the deck. Bugs does a couple of fancy shuffles, including one that back and forth through Elmer’s head.

Elmer jumps out of "The Scream," shakes off his Munchian interpretation, and looks around. Suddenly, Bugs and Daffy come dancing out of "Moulin Rouge" as a couple of high-kicking Can-Can girls. Elmer is intrigued. Bugs and Daffy kick him in ass and face, turn and raise their skirts at him, then disappear into another frame. Enraged, Elmer follows them into 171 172 173 76.
