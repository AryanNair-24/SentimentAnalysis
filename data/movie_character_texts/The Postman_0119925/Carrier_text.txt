A young recruit is ringing a bell on the top of a Winnebago. Ford walks along an RV boulevard. He's joined by two young carriers, RED and Chubby (the sentry from Benning). All wear hip, personalized variations of the official uniform.

91) 14) dialog: Postman sent Ford another letter. He's gonna read it.

99) 13) text: Getty sets some of the Carrier's anti-Holnist propaganda onto Bethlehem's field table. Bethlehem picks it up. It's hard to say what he's thinking.      Finally:
99) 16) text: Bethlehem looks back to Carrier Twelve.
100) 0) text: Ten letter carriers are on horseback. Among them, Red and Ponytail. Ford and The Postman are also on horses. Each rider salutes The Postman, then gets a sheaf of anti- Holnist propaganda from Ford.
109) 0) text: A mail carrier, Red, rides like the devil himself was in pursuit. Almost. It's Getty and three Holnists.
110) 7) text: Getty hands Bethlehem a sheet of paper -- something Gibbs missed. It's a propaganda sheet featuring a caricature of The Postman leading a few carriers against Bethlehem and his army -- represented as Hitler and the Nazis. The caption underneath reads: "Ride Against the Holnist Tide!"

113) 0) text: A beautiful day. Ponytail rounds a bend at a lope -- and then -- her eyes widen in terror. She jerks the reins; the horse rears in protest. Ahead: the truck stop. The five mail carriers hang upside down from the roof's overhang. A macabre sight.

137) 13) text: A hushed silence. The Postman walks away. The carriers exchange tired, defeated looks. Abby just sighs, knows he's not necessarily wrong. Ford catches up with The Postman.    He stares at The Postman; The Postman stares back.
139) 0) text: Some carriers drop their uniforms into a bonfire. The Postman and Abby ride up on the ridge above the RV camp. They pause to look back one last time. Across the way, on the other side, Ford is doing the same thing. As though he senses it, Ford stops and looks back. Ford raises his hand, salutes. Slowly, The Postman brings up his own hand. But he doesn't salute. He waves. Good- bye. As Ford turns away, so does The Postman.
141) 28) text: A frightened CARRIER is brought up. He wears a purple uniform with CALI sewn on the shoulder. Neither we nor Ford have seen him before. As a firing squad assembles, Ford is shoved over with him.

141) 33) dialog: It's an honor.
152) 11) text: A silent moment. It's been so long, no one's sure how to answer. The Postman looks down at the ground. The carriers exchange deflated looks. Then...
153) 7) text: The carriers look away -- sheepish.

158) 8) text: We see the faces of the young carriers. Defeated, bitter. But there's a sudden spark in Old George's eyes. He starts to rise. The soldiers pick up their guns and that's when they see The Postman.
160) 0) text: The army has gathered.    Three hundred strong. Bethlehem and Getty stand outside the command tent, listening to a winded, frightened Gibbs. We FOLLOW Bethlehem's eyes OVER Gibbs' SHOULDERS TO the horizon, where he sees: The Postman and his army of two hundred carriers cresting a distant rise.

163) 0) text: The Postman, Chubby, Ponytail and Old George and all the carriers have taken positions. The Postman sights through a telescope. He scans further down the line -- then stops when he sees Ford. Bloody, beaten within inches of his life. He's shackled -- surrounded by Holnist guards. The Postman's eyes turn to stone.
165) 41) text: Bethlehem reels, stumbling back. The Postman pounces on top of him, begins to strangle him. Bethlehem tries to pry the fingers from his throat, but can't. He's going to die. The Postman is urged on. By both sides. Holnists. Carriers. Ford. Even Holnist Luke. He looks up at the faces -- and finally lets Bethlehem go. The General gasps for breath. As Ponytail and Chubby move forward to untie Ford, The Postman looks to both sides.
165) 53) text: The Postman looks at carriers and Holnists alike.
