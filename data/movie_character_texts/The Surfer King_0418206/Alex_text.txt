4) 102) dialog: (interrupting again) Wasn't much? (again, to grounds kids) Can you just imagine for a moment the germs and bacteria our American soldiers could pick up in an unsanitised army latrine?

ROBBIE has picked up the sugar packets and ALEX is dancin and quickly (almost casually) tossing silverware/napkin r to ROBBIE as ROBBIE catches them (at first with some difficulty) and puts them on the tables. SARAH has re-stacked the cups, and is juggling salt &amp; shakers, placing them on the tables. AUDREY chops onions the beat.
4) 199) text: As the song ends (abruptly), AOKEE bumps a surfboard (par the restaurant's decoration) with his hip, knocking it an another one to the ground.

SKEETER waves his hand in front of SNITCH's fa No reaction.   He's never seen a naked girl before. We're back to ALEX and ROBBIE.

Page 31 of 81 Two guards are running and carrying a backboard. They converge in another BAYWATCH style slow-mo shot and line along the edge of the splashdown pool. One guard in the middle has a rescue tube, and, still in motion, squats down slowly as if to jump in and rescue th girl. At the low end of the jump crouch, however he stops. his face in close-up as he says.
4) 329) dialog: (smiling) Yep. (now laughing)
4) 331) dialog: There's no such thing as a table stretcher or a left-handed coffee pot.
4) 333) dialog: (smiling) It's just Aokee's way of giving you a tour of the park without having to be there. Consider it a rookie initiation.

Buffet tables line the area, and there is SMOOTHIE BAR se up. BIG MIKE himself is behind the bar making smoothies, while RICHARD is playing bass in the band.

4) 491) text: AOKEE begins singing the Hawaiian love song, "E O'Mai". couples are dancing; it is a slow song. ALEX, of course, is a goof. He dances slow, but every onc in a while executes a deep dip, much to AMY's terror. EDDIE is off to the edge of the dance floor, watching, longingly, and kind of swaying to the music. A couple of girls walk by and he does a magic trick for them. He holds both hands up, palms open to show he has nothing his hands. He also gestures that he has no sleeves (he is wearing a tuxedo t-shirt). He reaches behind his back and pulls out a trick bouquet of flowers, but they don't quit open right, and are still unfolding as he holds them. EDDIE smiles weakly, he knows that isn't quite how it was supposed to go. The girls appear encouraging, but as they leave look at each other and giggle. We pick up ROBBIE and KATIE dancing.
4) 503) text: They continue to dance. WE SEE BIG MIKE talking to TIFFAN and gesturing broadly. TIFFANY is clearly not agreeing wi what he is saying. COWBOY is nowhere to be seen.

She whispers something in his ear, and EDDIE'S eyes get r big as she leads him by the hand to the middle of the dan floor. She wraps her arms around EDDIE and they dance, al the while glaring at her father. EDDIE knows a good thing when he sees it, and quickly set in, Big Man on Campus. TIFFANY is taller than he is, so h happily puts his head on HER shoulder. BIG MIKE looks back at them, not happy with the way it happened, but satisfied. DOUG FITZGERALD (twenty bucks DOUG) is dancing with a gir when ALEX, doing some kind of fancy spin to AMY, bumps in him.
4) 505) dialog: Oh, Dougie. You know, I left my wallet over in my locker. I'll see you before we leave and get it to you then.

4) 526) dialog: And this is for bad little girls who don't know how to have fun.
4) 528) dialog: Oops.   There....almost got you.
4) 529) text: AMY is dodging and laughing. ALEX closes in and seems lik he will kiss her, but just starts gumming her neck, tickl her. AMY leans back laughing and WE SEE her back hits the volume knob on the amplifier.
4) 536) dialog: (interrupting, but to AMY) Uh oh. Sorry. Hold that thought.
4) 538) dialog: (into the radio) I'm on it.
4) 539) text: He turns down the volume back to normal. He also flips a switch. They hear the tune now, and AMY jumps off the counter, stands there and smiles. ALEX does an over-the-t mambo moving to her and they start to slow dance.

4) 622) dialog: (together) Yeee-haww.
