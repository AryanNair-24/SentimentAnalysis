A couple of girls walk by and he does a magic trick for them. He holds both hands up, palms open to show he has nothing his hands. He also gestures that he has no sleeves (he is wearing a tuxedo t-shirt). He reaches behind his back and pulls out a trick bouquet of flowers, but they don't quit open right, and are still unfolding as he holds them.

4) 520) dialog: Well, I must admit, I've met some very nice people. (looking down and smiling) In California, the attitude's a little different. Here, not everyone is out to prove something. Seem's like everyone just wants to have fun.
4) 532) dialog: Just a sec.
4) 534) dialog: Hey, Alex. Give us break down here. Turn down the sound effects.
4) 541) dialog: (quizzically) So where did you learn to dance like this?
