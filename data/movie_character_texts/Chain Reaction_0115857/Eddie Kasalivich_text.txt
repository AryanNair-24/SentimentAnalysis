1) 3) dialog: Just out. He continues down the hall, nearly running over LILY NAUGHTON, roughly Eddie's age. She's wearing a lab coat over her jeans, the kind of woman who would be stunning if she took even a minute to think about it, which she doesn't. Mostly she thinks about her work (she runs the lab as Chen's assistant), and when she isn't thinking about that, she thinks about the long backpacking trips she wishes she had more time to take.

6) 14) dialog: (continued) You shouldn't drive, anyway. Come on, I'll take you home.

6) 16) dialog: Where do you live?
6) 19) dialog: You're a snob.
6) 21) dialog: Could've made a mistake.
6) 23) dialog: I know exactly what you mean. They're standing at a bus stop.

Eddie puts the book away, peers out the window.
11) 2) dialog: (continued) Hey. This is us.
11) 3) text: Eddie half carries Lily up the stairs to her apartment. She's leaning into him, speaking into his neck.
11) 5) dialog: Can you stand up while I do this?
11) 8) dialog: Bedroom? She points.
11) 10) dialog: Not right now.
11) 12) dialog: Yes. He drops her gently onto the bed. Swings her feet up. Slips her shoes off.

15) 3) dialog: Bucky? No answer. Bucky's computer is on, the screen casting a dim, green glow into the small office. Eddie repeats:
15) 4) dialog: (continued) Bucky? You awake? Still no answer. Eddie crosses to the chair, and what he sees hits him like a hard blow to his chest, taking his breath away:...
15) 6) dialog: Oh, my god: Oh, Jesus... He yanks the bag off Bucky's head with such force that Bucky's inert body falls from the chair onto the floor.
15) 7) dialog: (continued) Oh, Jesus, Bucky! He's down on the floor with Bucky, holding the old man's head back, breathing into his mouth. And then he begins pumping Bucky's chest.
15) 8) dialog: (continued) Oh, Bucky, come on... come on... He breathes into his mouth again, pumps his chest, but it's useless.
15) 9) dialog: (continued) Oh, shit, oh shit! He scrambles up, searches wildly for a phone, lifts the receiver: the line is dead. The cord dangles loosely to the floor. Eddie darts out of the room into the
