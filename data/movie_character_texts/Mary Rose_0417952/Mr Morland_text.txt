Her smile doesn't altogether disappear, but it becomes pain- fully poignant as she looks at the pictures. We, too, see them, these faded images of the past, the color of the present giving way to the sepia shades of memory, The first one we see, at first glare might almost be the one taken on KENNETH'S second birthday. But we must stay with it long enough to take in the three candles on the cake, MRS, MORLAND now occupying the place of the absent MARY ROSE, and somewhat apert, unsmiling, SIMON, who is looking not at the little boy on his birthday, but into some distance of his own. The boy, KENNETH, is seen to be fair and blue-eyed like his mother, and he has somethi of her open gaze and look of innocent joy. This first picture should be followed by several more...five or six. all on KENNETH'S birthdays. MRS. MORLAND is always there. SIMON is sometimes not. The pictures in which SIMON is Present should reveal the estrangement between father and son. They are never touching, never smiling at each other, always separated by some person or thing. The last shot should be dated 1914 and we should see SIMON in some attitude indicating his role as warrior and KENNETH'S env and eagerness to join the company of men. Under the date 1915 there is no picture. Instead, in a firm hand should be written the words, ‘Private Kenneth Moreland Blake, Missing in Action.'
