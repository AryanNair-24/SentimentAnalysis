16) 11) dialog: Darian's class drew holiday pictures. That was hers. Her teacher wants to see us, Joe.

16) 18) dialog: I'm tense. I couldn't get to sleep last night.
16) 20) dialog: Are you kidding? Brace Face, that's the latest. Little bastards.

18) 2) dialog: Excuse me?
18) 9) dialog: Well, nothing changes.    You're still a lunatic.
18) 11) dialog: Please leave.    I have to get dressed.
18) 13) dialog: You want me to open the closet, Joe? Huh? You want me to indulge your fucking paranoia, I'll throw the door open, is that what you want me to do...?
18) 15) dialog: I'll do it, Joe. Okay? And then we'll both know you're a psycho, is that what you want? Huh?? An awkward pause.   Finally Hallenbeck scowls and says:
18) 17) dialog: Thank you.
18) 23) dialog: If you shoot up my house, Joe, I will make you eat that gun.
18) 25) dialog: Call your shrink, Joe. I still have the number. Call him and tell him you're losing it, I cannot fucking deal with you like this -- !
18) 27) dialog: Joe, dammit -- ! He sighs. Starts to pull the trigger.    And Sarah screams --
18) 28) dialog: Jesus, no -- ! And grabs the gun. Everything freezes. She looks at him.    He looks at her. Understanding occurs.
18) 51) text: I don't gotta understand anything. Sarah speaks then.   Head down.   Eyes averted.
18) 52) dialog: Put the gun down.
18) 54) text: You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts. He pulls the trigger. The SHOT is DEAFENING in the closed room. Mike Miller screams and clutches at himself. The bullet goes high and wide. Over his head. On the wall is a framed wedding photo. The twin of the one in Hallenbeck's office. The bullet strikes it dead center. Blows it to pieces. Silence. The tinkle of glass hitting the floor. Hallenbeck turns. Regards his wife with hooded, lifeless eyes.
18) 56) dialog: She stayed at Cindy's last night. He nods.   Turns and waves the gun at Miller.
53) 103) dialog: Do what he says, Joe. Joe sits. Breathing shallowly. Eyes locked on Milo.
53) 105) dialog: Yes.
56) 13) dialog: Goddamn you, stop it!!     Oh, Jesus, leave him alone!
56) 18) dialog: Shhh. It's okay, Joe. I'm here, it's okay. (strokes his hair)
56) 21) dialog: I never stopped loving you, Joe.
56) 23) dialog: You knew about the others?
56) 25) dialog: You never said anything.
56) 27) dialog: Joe, Goddammit, why didn't you say something?
56) 29) dialog: Yes. Fuck you, Sarah! Anything to show that you... that you had some pride left. A pause.   Then Hallenbeck heaves a sigh.
56) 34) dialog: I'm scared, Joe. Get me out of this.
56) 36) dialog: You can take these guys, Joe.
56) 38) dialog: Save me, Joe.    Be a hero.
56) 40) dialog: That's no excuse. He stares up at her for a moment.      Then, through bloo lips:
56) 52) dialog: Joe...! He stops.    Turns.   Looks at her. Boys and girls, there is, within Joe Hallenbeck, a spark: Tiny. Fizzling. Almost gone. But now, looking at his wife, that spark unexpectedly kindles -- And eight years melt away. Just like that. The old Joe Hallenbeck looks his wife in the eye and says, with deadly calm:
112) 2) dialog: on a bed, naked. bright lights on her.    Around her, a director.     A cameraman.
113) 0) text: Sarah is now dressed, as Joe supports her across the sidewalk toward the stolen Mercedes. He turns to Jimmy. Hands him a set of keys.
113) 6) dialog: Why can't we go home?
113) 8) dialog: Oh. It's a very tiny "oh."
114) 2) dialog: Will the police catch Marcon?
114) 4) dialog: I remember when we got married... My friends would talk about their husbands. They'd say, 'Oh, my husband is a big-time publisher,' or, 'My husband is a brilliant lawyer...' I used to say, 'My husband can stand over a shotgun victim and eat a ham sandwich without puking.'
114) 6) dialog: I want to try, Joe.   Do you still want to try? A pause.   He leans in and kisses her tenderly. And, with typically swell timing, a set of headlights rakes across the window, accompanied by the strobing light of a police flasher.
114) 8) dialog: Shall we invite him in?
116) 0) text: Sarah sits bolt upright. Eyes panicked.    Terrified. Darian comes awake, screaming:
118) 9) dialog: You just fucking die. She FIRES again, and Milo reels backward. Leaves a bloody smudge on the billboard. She DROPS the HAMMER again and again.     Empties the gun Milo jerks and twitches.     Racked by gunfire. Paints a bloody stripe across the billboard, making Gorgeous's bloody buns even bloodier -- Clutches himself.     Looks over at Hallenbeck.
