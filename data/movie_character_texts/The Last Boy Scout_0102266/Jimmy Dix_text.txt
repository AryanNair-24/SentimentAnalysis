8) 2) dialog: Jesus, kid, if only you weren't so damn ugly. He gets up and goes into the head. Pulls out a glass vial. Dips a coke spoon with practiced ease. Sucks it up a nostril. For one moment, he catches his own eye in the mirror.
8) 9) dialog: I don't know. He looks up at his reflection. Glazed eyes, beard stubble. Crows' feet around the eyes.
8) 10) dialog: Yeah.    I guess I am. He sniffs, clearing his nose.
11) 0) text: Jimmy Dix leaves the bedroom. Pads barefoot down a hall littered with beer cans, food wrappers. A sleeping guy. Stops at a door, peeks in: all-night poker game in progress. Four bleary-eyed men. Unshaven. Stack of wrinkled money on a card table.
11) 1) dialog: 'Morning, boys. They all grunt. One of them, name of HENRY, looks up at him. Holds out a half-smoked doobie:
11) 3) dialog: No, man. Why do you think they call it dope? (beat) Henry, did I do anything last night that I should know about?
11) 5) dialog: No, man, I meant something bad, that I should know about.
11) 10) dialog: Soon, Henry. One of the other PLAYERS looks up, says:
11) 12) dialog: '86 and '87, that was me.
11) 14) dialog: Thanks.   What the hell, shit floats.   I'll be back.
11) 16) dialog: I'll be back. Everyone plays cards.    No one looks at him.   He frowns Leaves.
12) 0) text: Jimmy is seated in the devastated living room. Putting on shoes. He hears a COMMOTION outside: A woman scream- ing. Water splashing. He frowns, puzzled. Gets up. Pads out onto a redwood deck.
13) 0) text: A six-foot behemoth is seated in a jacuzzi at the far end of the deck. He is dunking a terrified female head under the water and laughing. Jimmy clears his throat.
13) 4) dialog: Ho.    Ray. The MAN looks up, annoyed.
13) 6) dialog: What's with the girl? She surfaces, sputtering and screaming.   Ray thrusts her beneath the surface again.
13) 8) dialog: (pause, then) Too early in the morning, Ray. Let her go.
13) 10) dialog: Ray.   Let her go.
13) 12) dialog: Ray, she's gonna drown.
13) 14) dialog: Last chance, Ray.
13) 19) dialog: Fine. Jimmy turns, as if to walk away. Instead, he spins back and launches the football. It sings, that's how hard he throws it. And when it smacks Ray in the face, something breaks. It ain't the ball. The big man howls. Clutching his flattened nose. The girl comes up for air. Gagging and choking. Jimmy is at her side instantly. Pulls her out of the water.
13) 20) dialog: Get out of here. Go. She goes. He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair. The guy is bleeding. Delirious. Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart.
13) 21) dialog: Best arm in the National League, you son of a bitch. Remember that. He lets go. Ray sags, semi-conscious. The poker players come running as Jimmy walks back inside
14) 0) text: Jimmy gets into the car. Takes out his vial. Spoons some powder, sucks it up. A voice in the background: "Hey, someone shit on my car!"
21) 0) text: Rowdy strip club in   West Hollywood. Just like the suggests; if it's a   virus, you're sitting on it.      A three drinks, every   girl on stage looks like your     h school sweetheart.    Was your sweetheart fat? Did      s have excessive body   hair? FUNK MUSIC, played LOUD. The Monday crowd stomps and claps. Onstage a stripper grinds away with an enthusiasm usually reserved for standing in line at the DMV. Jimmy Dix sits at the bar, hooting and whistling. Behind the bar, a black man in a wheelchair serves drinks. His name is HARP. Off to one side, a twenty-five-year-old BEANPOLE speaks into a microphone:
21) 6) dialog: Alex the astronaut. Harp raises his own glass.
21) 8) dialog: I've had it, Harp.
21) 10) dialog: It, man. I've had it. (takes a swig) I don't remember what I did  last night. I'm an idiot, Harp,   I act like a complete dickhead.   I don't have friends. I drink too   much. I fuck anything that's warm  and breathing.
21) 12) dialog: (sighs) I cheated on my girl friend again.
21) 14) dialog: Maybe so, Harp. Maybe so. His gaze wanders across the crowded room, fixating on --
21) 31) text: The lovely Cory approaches Jimmy at the bar.     Harp loo on.
21) 33) dialog: How much for a bottle?
21) 35) dialog: No thanks. Nothing personal, my seventh grade teacher was killed by a drunk driver.
21) 37) dialog: That's the one.
21) 39) dialog: Ha-ha.
21) 41) dialog: For forty bucks I'd rather drink my own piss.
21) 43) dialog: Hi, Cory.   Rough night?
21) 48) dialog: (grins) I'll bet you have. She slaps his face.   He feigns innocence.   Points to Hallenbeck.
21) 49) dialog: Who's the stiff?
21) 51) dialog: Come back soon. I want to buy you a drink. She smiles and moves off, swishingly. Jimmy watches her go. His gaze wanders across the room to Hallenbeck. He frowns.
21) 60) dialog: Hi.   You're nobody.
21) 62) dialog: That's what Cory said.    She said you were nobody. Only Hallenbeck's eyes move. He looks up, regards Jimmy coolly. They size each other up. Hallenbeck sighs.
21) 64) dialog: I see. What are you, some kind of bodyguard?
21) 66) dialog: No.   Is Cory in trouble?
21) 68) dialog: She didn't mention anything to me.
21) 73) dialog: Maybe.
21) 75) dialog: She hired you, huh?      What, you in the phonebook?
21) 77) dialog: Where's Mike?
21) 79) dialog: Sorry to hear it.
21) 81) dialog: Look, friend, I don't know who you are or what's going on. But Cory is my girl friend and if she's in trouble, I want to hear about it.
21) 83) dialog: Tell me anyway.
21) 85) dialog: I say two words to Cory and you don't get paid, asshole.
21) 90) dialog: You sure? I'm looking at your suit, you could use the dough.
21) 92) dialog: Good, 'cause you're not getting any.
21) 94) dialog: What is?
21) 96) dialog: You couldn't protect a cup of warm piss.
21) 98) dialog: Excuse me?
21) 100) dialog: (freezes) You know who I am?
21) 107) dialog: Mister... You are now pissing me off.
21) 109) dialog: (ignores the hand) I don't know, Joe... You look like a dumb wop to me.
21) 111) dialog: Can I hit you now?
21) 114) dialog: (gasping) You think you're some kind of hot shit tough guy, huh?
21) 119) dialog: Piss off.
21) 121) dialog: Yeah.   Thanks. I guess.
22) 0) text: Cory and Jimmy are engaged in very hot sex. This is not a love scene; this is a sex scene. Sigh. I'm not even going to attempt to write this quote-unquote "steamy" scene here, for several good reasons: A)   The things that I find steamy are none of your damn business, Jack, in addition to which -- B)   The two actors involved will no doubt have wonderful highly athletic ideas which manage to elude most fat-assed writers anyhow, and finally -- C)   My mother reads this shit.   So there. (P.S.: I think we lost her back at the Jacuzzi blowjob scene.)
22) 4) dialog: Alex the pediatrician.
26) 0) text: Cory and Jimmy emerge from the club into the parking lot. She scans the area, shaking her head.
26) 2) dialog: Sure. He heads for his car.
26) 3) text: The Hitmen wait in the darkened sedan. Watching Jimmy and Cory. The driver keys the ignition. Starts the car. In his lap is an automatic rifle.
28) 0) text: Jimmy Dix is behind the wheel of a silver Jag. Cory is driving a spanking new Ford Fiero. Jimmy follows behind Cory, watchdogging. Humming with JOE COCKER on the RADIO. Cory comes to a red light.    Pauses.   Turns right onto sidestreet. Jimmy slows, pausing at the intersection.
28) 2) dialog: Oh God. This is a hit this is a fucking hit!!
28) 4) dialog: frantically floors the pedal of his Jag, pops the clutch -- And stalls out. He roars with anger. Flings open the door. Leaps out and runs forward, screaming:
28) 5) dialog: Cory, get out of there!! Too late.    Cory is already out of her car, yelling:
28) 10) dialog: Oh Gooood!! And without missing a beat, the Hitmen turn -- And OPEN FIRE on Jimmy. He takes a running start. Clears the hood of his Jag in a single leap. BULLETS DICE the metal behind him. He lands, hard.   Sucks the ground.    Huddled behind his car, as:
28) 16) dialog: is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken glass. Hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window.
28) 18) text: Jimmy puts it in reverse. The car backs up. Steam pouring from the crumpled hood. The Hitman, now freed, collapses to the street. Like a sack of flour. Hallenbeck limps toward him, wheezing. He stops as:
29) 0) text: SERGEANT BENJAMIN BESSALO sits behind his desk, scanning a stack of typed pages. A tired-looking cop named McCASKE lounges in the doorway. A Christmas tree in the corner sheds needles. Through the glass window, we can see Hallenbeck and Jimmy seated outside in the squad room proper. Bessalo stops reading. Sniffs the air. Frowns:
30) 0) text: Outside the office Hallenbeck and Jimmy are perched side by side on a wooden bench. Jimmy is crumpling pieces of paper and tossing them at a wastebasket. He throws with unerring accuracy. Beside him Hallenbeck frowns, deep in thought. Finally, Jimmy speaks:
30) 1) dialog: That stuff Cory fed you about a weirdo hassling her. That was all bullshit, wasn't it...?
30) 6) dialog: None of your fucking business.
30) 8) dialog: (pause) I don't know. Pretty strapped, I guess.
30) 10) dialog: No hooking, if that's what you mean.
30) 12) dialog: The usual. Waitressing. Get a guy to buy you a bottle of champagne. Sit in a private booth, let the poor fuck spill his troubles. Used to say she'd make a great psychiatrist.
30) 14) dialog: Sure.   Even rich guys get lonely.
30) 16) dialog: I don't get it.
30) 18) dialog: Jesus, I've had about enough of you --
30) 23) dialog: (sighs) She'd consider it. If she could get away with it. But she'd need hard evidence. Otherwise, it's 'I never said that,' his word against hers.
30) 25) dialog: I don't know.    Follow the guy?   Have him followed?
30) 27) dialog: Who does she hire?
30) 29) dialog: Except you told me that Mike was a shitty surveillance man.
30) 31) dialog: Christ, what did the two of them stumble onto?
30) 33) dialog: How you figure?
30) 38) dialog: He handed it to you... without telling you how dangerous it was? Hallenbeck stares straight ahead.    Sighs and says:
31) 0) text: Hallenbeck is collecting his firearm from the property clerk. Jimmy lounges against the wall. Winks at a hooker as she goes by in the hall, followed by a patrol cop. Jimmy eyes his rumpled trousers.    Ripped shirt. JIMMY
31) 3) dialog: Do me a favor and shut up. You think I don't care that Cory's dead? (rubs tired eyes) Christ, I feel like I been rode hard and put away wet.
31) 8) dialog: Wow. What stunning advice.      I was gonna go hiking.
31) 10) dialog: You know something, Joe, for a private eye, you sure don't go in for snappy comebacks.
31) 12) dialog: Get some sleep. A passing PATROLMAN stops.   Eyes Jimmy thoughtfully. Frowns:
31) 14) dialog: You might.    Some people recognize me.
31) 16) dialog: No, man. I played football. Jimmy Dix, L.A. Stallions.
31) 18) dialog: Forget it.
31) 24) dialog: Fuck you.
31) 26) dialog: That son of a bitch! He's ready to clean the pimp's clock when Hallenbeck grabs him, spins him bodily. Propels him out the front doors. Away from trouble.
32) 2) dialog: He hit the chick.
32) 4) dialog: Guy shouldn't treat a woman like that, is all I'm saying. He just shouldn't, okay?
32) 9) dialog: (pause, then) Yeah. He's serious. Hallenbeck starts to chuckle. Shakes his head, lights a cigarette. Laughs through the smoke. This may be the funniest thing he's ever heard.
33) 0) text: Hallenbeck walks across the parking lot toward his car. Jimmy trots behind him.
33) 1) dialog: Mind if I catch a ride with you?
33) 3) dialog: My car's fucked up, remember?
33) 7) dialog: That's it.     Good night?
33) 9) dialog: What are you gonna do?
33) 11) dialog: What's the message?
33) 16) dialog: You're kidding. Joe gets in the car.   Says nothing.
33) 17) dialog: You're backing off, you're not gonna do anything? I watch T.V., what the fuck kind of private eye doesn't do anything?
33) 19) dialog: Fuck you your job is done.    We witnessed a murder, Joe!
33) 21) dialog: Look, until this is over, I'm sticking with you.
33) 23) dialog: I'm part of this. We do something, we do it together.
33) 25) dialog: Don't drive away, Joe. Joe puts it in gear.   Pulls away.
33) 29) dialog: Joe -- !     I'll tell the cops, Joe. Joe taps the brake.    Stops.   Leans out the window, say softly:
33) 31) dialog: That Mike Miller was fucking your wife. (beat) Only reason you're not in the cooler, tough guy, is the cops got no motive for Miller's death. When they find out Mikey was dickin' your old lady, seems to me you become suspect numero uno. I'm scared, and I'm coming with you, got it? Joe gets out of the car and advances on Jimmy.
33) 33) dialog: Go for it. Then the cops'll really love my story. (smiles) You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead.
33) 35) dialog: Gosh, you're tough.
34) 0) text: Hallenbeck is in a foul mood. Jimmy lights a cigarette and applies for a position as pep chairman:
34) 1) dialog: You got any hobbies?
34) 6) dialog: Ventriloquist, really? I hear Ps and Bs are the hardest.
34) 8) dialog: (interrupts) Hey, you got any tapes in here? (leans forward) Man, what is this shit? Dick Haymes. Who the fuck is Dick Haymes? Jeez, you must be older than I thought. Hallenbeck grimaces and shifts in his seat.
34) 9) dialog: What's the matter? Stomach problems?
34) 11) dialog: What kind of ear problems?
34) 13) dialog: Baynard, huh? What's the matter, you got some kind of beef with the guy?
34) 15) dialog: You wanna share with the class?
34) 22) dialog: You're high. Get outta here. (grins) Really...? You protected the man? Holy shit, you musta got laid every night.
34) 24) dialog: She had an apartment on the West Side. Why?
34) 26) dialog: I thought you were off the case.
34) 28) dialog: Whoa, back up. You mean, we're gonna nail these fuckers after all...? (grins) Damn. I knew there was a hero lurking beneath that gruff exterior.
35) 0) text: Jimmy and Hallenbeck make their way down a flagstone walk between tiny, palm-shaded cottages. The moon casts a pale glow.
35) 2) dialog: Tell me about it. I'm paying the fucking rent. HALLENBECK
35) 4) dialog: Wasn't like that. Cory could've had lots of rich guys. Me, she loved.
35) 6) dialog: Let me guess.    You don't believe in love.
35) 8) dialog: What, they're both diseases?
35) 10) dialog: Man, I don't want to meet the bitch that fucked you up.
35) 12) dialog: Little bitter, Joe?
36) 0) text: The two men approach the door.   Jimmy takes out his key ring.
36) 2) dialog: Yes, massah.
37) 0) text: Jimmy opens the door.   Flips on the lights.     Stops in his tracks. The room has been systematically torn to pieces. A knife has been used to rip open the couch. Broken furniture, shredded clothing. Everywhere. It looks like a combat zone.
37) 1) dialog: I think someone disturbed some stuff, Joe.
37) 3) dialog: Beat us to what?
37) 5) dialog: Assuming there was any.     Stay here a minute.
37) 7) dialog: Bathroom. You wanna come with me? Doctor said I shouldn't lift anything heavy.
38) 0) text: Jimmy enters and shuts the door behind him. He scans the floor, covered with clothes, bottles, etc. Picks up a carelessly discarded can of Right Guard deodorant. Turns it upside down, and unscrews the bottom. Inside, the can is hollow and empty. The perfect hiding place. Jimmy heaves a sigh of relief. Removes a little plastic Baggie filled with white powder. Stashes it in his shorts. Starts to replace the lid. Stops. Frowns. Reaches into the can a second time -- And pulls out a yellow envelope. He looks at it, perplexed. Puts it in his pocket. Replaces the lid. Tosses the can on the floor. Flushes the toilet. Leaves.
39) 3) dialog: Find anything?
39) 8) dialog: I may have something.
39) 10) dialog: Later.   Let's get out of here.
40) 0) text: The two men emerge from the house. Joe heads for his car. Jimmy peels off toward a battered GMC Pacer parked at the curb.
40) 2) dialog: As long as we're here, I might as well take Cory's car.
40) 4) dialog: Yeah.    I'll follow you. Hallenbeck starts to turn away.      Jimmy gets in the ca Hallenbeck stops. Frowns.
40) 6) dialog: Yeah. This one's just sitting here until she can sell it. The color drains from Hallenbeck's features.
40) 8) dialog: Ouch -- !     What's your problem?
40) 14) dialog: Oh.   Shit.    Oh. Jeez. Hallenbeck claps him on the back.
40) 16) dialog: What are you doing? Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters.
40) 18) dialog: Whoa. Hold on. Um, shouldn't we call the bomb squad or something?
40) 21) dialog: No, man, I --
40) 27) dialog: You're a fucking asshole!
40) 32) dialog: Great.   So what now?
40) 34) dialog: Give up?     Flee? Go really far away?
40) 40) dialog: Sure.   Family, huh?   You got kids?
40) 42) dialog: Does she like you?
40) 44) dialog: I like Prince.
40) 46) dialog: (indicating bomb) You're just gonna stick that in your trunk?
40) 50) dialog: Is it the cops?
40) 57) dialog: The streetlights are on.
40) 60) dialog: Tell him it's not for sale.
40) 74) dialog: Leave him alone, you fuck!
40) 81) dialog: Christ... I'm being beat up by the inventor of Scrabble.
40) 85) dialog: And then you'll let us go, right?
40) 103) dialog: Jesus fucking Christ! They both dive for cover, out of the way. Barely make it. The CAR plows past them in a shower of dirt. CRUMPLING. Heaving. Spitting fire. Finally SLAMS to a halt against a palm tree. Burns. The night is filled with SHOUTS and CURSES. The sound of DOORS OPENING. The crackle of flames.
40) 109) dialog: Don't know yet. They crawl to their feet, inspecting for broken bones.
40) 110) dialog: The dynamite?
40) 112) dialog: Dead guys... don't make bad jokes, right?
40) 114) dialog: So we're alive.
40) 117) dialog: What?
42) 0) text: Jimmy's at the wheel of a rented Subaru. Hallenbeck beside him. He hands Joe the envelope he found in Cory's apartment.
42) 1) dialog: If you thought there was dynamite in the trunk, wait'll you see this. Hallenbeck reaches into the envelope and extracts a photograph: Two men having lunch together on a secluded patio. Both are older, distinguished-looking. Joe suddenly looks very pale.
42) 2) dialog: The guy on the left is Connie Marcon, the owner of the L.A. Stallions.
42) 4) dialog: Sort of familiar. Who is he?
42) 6) dialog: Let's go back to the cops.   I'm scared.
42) 11) dialog: Not so bad. Excuse me, did you just say the words not so bad? You don't understand, Joe, see, if a guy vomits on the sidewalk, you don't say, 'Oh, hey, it's not so bad, there's some ham in there.' It's fucking vomit, okay? This is bad. Hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette. Stares straight ahead through the windshield.   Begins to talk:
42) 32) dialog: The senator fucked your job.
42) 34) dialog: Cory tumbled to some sort of deal between Marcon and the senator, and they had her killed. (beat)
42) 37) text: I want Baynard, Jimmy. I want to bring him down. I could use your help.
42) 38) dialog: Why should I help you?
45) 0) text: Dawn is a ghost on the horizon as Jimmy parks the rental Subaru outside. The two men emerge. Head for the front door.
45) 1) dialog: So I get to meet your family, huh? What's your daughter like?
46) 10) dialog: Why couldn't she go?
46) 29) dialog: Hey, Joe, take it easy...
46) 45) dialog: You know, for fifty bucks you could get a guy to pull out her fingernails with a pair of pliers.
46) 50) dialog: I think we could both use a drink. Hallenbeck   crosses to a cabinet, breaks out a bottle of Seagrams.    Swigs.  Hands it to Jimmy. As Jimmy drinks, he notices   a photo on the wall: Hallenbeck shaking hands with   George Bush.
46) 51) dialog: That's you?
46) 53) dialog: You look like the dad on 'The Brady Bunch.'
46) 55) dialog: So.    You gonna get a divorce?
46) 57) dialog: You don't like women much, do you, Joe?
46) 59) dialog: And now?
46) 64) dialog: Horseshit, he was a scumbag private eye.
46) 66) dialog: He tried to get you killed.
46) 68) dialog: You know what I did last night?
46) 70) dialog: I went to a party and shit on a car.
46) 72) dialog: I'm a complete loser. Capital 'L.' All I ever wanted... was to be somebody's hero, you know it...? Now I mostly sit around. Watch T.V. Get laid. I'm a fucking slug, throw salt on me I'd curl up. Life sucks.
46) 74) dialog: Life doesn't suck?
46) 76) dialog: Yeah, and the last thing I did was cheat on her. (beat) Why do people cheat, Joe?
46) 81) dialog: Ooooooh.     Very deep.
46) 83) dialog: It means another drink is required. He raises the bottle.
46) 84) dialog: Alex the accountant. He drinks.   Hallenbeck frowns, watching him.
46) 86) dialog: No.  But he could have been. (beat) Alex was my son. Hallenbeck stares at him.
46) 87) dialog: I was married at 19. Sweet young thing, looking to get out from under daddy's thumb. I didn't know she was a junkie. All during her pregnancy. Shooting up. There were complications. She died. Alex lived for seventeen minutes in the incubator. Fell asleep. Died before he woke up. (takes a drink) He was born... He had time for one dream... and then he died. I wonder what his dream was about.
46) 89) dialog: I think about him a lot.     I mean, who was this... guy?
46) 94) dialog: This little guy who only got seventeen minutes, who was he, Joe...? What was he like? (beat)
46) 97) dialog: (shakes his head)
46) 100) dialog: (softly)
46) 102) dialog: I'm gonna borrow your shower. He exits.    Hallenbeck watches him go.     Says nothing.
47) 0) text: Jimmy enters and shuts the door. Turns on the shower. Makes no move to undress. Instead, he reaches inside the waistband on his pants. Removes a vial of coke. Dips a spoon. The door opens. Hallenbeck is standing there with a handful of fresh towels. He stops. Staring at Jimmy. They freeze in tableau. Then Hallenbeck crosses the floor with two quick strides and slugs Jimmy with all his might. Decks him. The kid goes over backward into the shower, head striking the porcelain. He swerves. Claws his way out, drenched.
47) 5) dialog: Joe, man, you don't get it --
47) 8) dialog: Joe, please! Joe drops the vial in the water. Flushes. Jimmy darts forward. Joe shoves him back.
47) 9) dialog: You stupid bastard, do you know what you've done? That was a thousand bucks' worth of shit!
47) 11) dialog: You don't understand.
47) 13) dialog: Go ahead, tough guy. Go ahead. (beat) I'm trying to survive, man. I use that stuff to get by, so fuck you.
47) 18) dialog: Oh, sure, Dudley fucking Do-Right, you stand there and judge me, and, meanwhile, you never had your old lady die on you, did you, pal?? And your fucking kid?? And I said to God, 'Hey, buddy, what gives? I go to church, I give to the United Way, what is this dead wife and kid shit...?' And he didn't say nothin', Joe. He grabs a towel.   Scrubs savagely at his wet torso.
47) 19) dialog: And then I lose my job, my fucking life, okay, and why...? You know why? Because I gambled. Whoa, hold on, stop the presses, Jimmy gambled, well shit, of course I gambled, everybody does, and the fucking league knows it! He advances on Joe, trembling with anger.
47) 20) dialog: Why, Joe? Why is there an injury report in pro football, huh...? Nobody else has a fucking injury report, but the N.F.L. does, so the fucking gamblers will know the spread! Marcon... the commissioner ... those fucking hypocrites... killed the last thing I could do, Joe...! I can't do anything... anymore. And suddenly he is crying.
47) 21) dialog: I couldn't save my wife... She died screaming and I couldn't do a Goddamn thing... And my baby came out... and he was so fuckin' small, Joe... He was too fuckin' small... He collapses against the wall. Slides down to a sitting position.   Huddled on the floor Hallenbeck watches him. Says nothing. For a moment, he seems moved to compassion... Then his gaze hardens. He kneels next to Jimmy.
47) 26) dialog: (wipes his eyes) You're a total bastard.
47) 29) dialog: Huh? There is an awkward pause. Darian holds out a football card. Young, smiling Jimmy. The card is old. Tattered.
47) 39) dialog: I never shaved points, Joe.     I never did. Joe is silent.   Stone-faced.
47) 40) dialog: If you want my help, I'm at the Casa Loma Apartments on Ventura. He exits. Shuts the door behind him. Darian goes into her room, fuming. Shuts the door. Joe is alone.    He turns.   Sees his reflection in the h mirror.
50) 0) text: Jimmy looks bad. Sprawled out on a tangle of dirty sheets. Jeans. Bare feet. Smoking. Staring at a football card. A duplicate of the one Darian showed him. He swings his legs off the bed. Stands, crushes out his cigarette. Moves into the bathroom. The Baggie of coke is on the counter. He stares at it with bloodshot eyes. Swallows hard. Acts before he can think. Grabs the Baggie. Tosses it in the toilet. Flushes. Watches as it goes down the drain.
51) 5) dialog: Who are you, and how the fuck do you know my name?
51) 12) dialog: I'm growing whiskers here, guys. You got something to say, fucking say it.
51) 17) dialog: Who?
51) 21) dialog: Please, guys, don't do this... Jesus Christ, I was just her boyfriend, I swear to God, please! They toss Jimmy over the fence.
51) 22) text: Not a terrible fate, under normal circumstances. In this case, however -- A fifty-foot drop... Awaits him beyond the fence. A huge, looming pit dug into the earth. Foundation for a new parking garage. Jimmy plummets like a stone. Under normal circumstances, he'd be dead. But since it rained last night, he's got three feet of water to land in. He hits with a splash.   Disappears beneath the water. Surfaces, screaming in pain. Thrashes in the muddy water, and only when he looks down does he notice the splintered bone jutting out of his skin at a crazy angle.
51) 26) dialog: Oh, God, my arm, my fucking arm, oh Jesus Christ!!! He kneels in the muddy water, rocking back and forth.
51) 27) dialog: Alone in the pit. Huddled in a pool of muddy water. His screams of pain ECHO in the chill, morning air.
52) 3) text: Bad news is, they just pulled Jimmy Dix out of a construction site on Ventura. He's busted up.
54) 0) text: Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Jimmy is seated, shirtless, on a metal examining table. His ribs are taped. His arm in a cast. Two men loom over him, sour expressions on their faces: Sergeants McCaskey and Bessalo. Jimmy shakes his head, exasperated:
54) 1) dialog: Look, I'll say it again for the cheap seats: I don't know anything and I can't help you. Okay? Can I go now? Bessalo grimaces in disgust.
54) 3) dialog: That's it.
54) 5) dialog: How the fuck should I know?    Try his house.
54) 7) dialog: For Chrissake, I just met the guy. (beat) Look, Sergeant. I don't give a shit about Joe Hallenbeck. I just busted my throwing arm and I'm in a real pissy mood, so you got two choices: either charge me with something or let me the fuck outta here. He glares defiantly at Bessalo.
55) 0) text: The grey day wears on. Jimmy trudges stiffly down the walk toward his apartment unit. Pulls up short, staring ahead --
55) 2) dialog: Hey.    Wake up. She stirs. Awakens, looking at him. Her eyes are puffy and red from crying. Her hair is a tangled mess. She hands him the piece of paper, and promptly bursts into tears. Buries her head in his chest, sobbing. He cradles her with his good arm. Awkwardly unfolds the crumpled paper and reads:
57) 0) text: Remember Jimmy's friend, Henry, who we met briefly near the opening of the film? Of course you do, you're a highly-paid reader or development person. Well, Henry is seated in a big, lived-in den watching football films. The walls around him are adorned with hunting paraphernalia. Rifles. Trophies. There is a KNOCK at the door. He gets up. Crosses to the door. Opens it. And Jimmy Dix is there.     He gets right to the point:
57) 1) dialog: I need to borrow a gun, Henry.
59) 0) text: A sign reads, BOAT RENTALS:   DAY AND WEEK. Jimmy moves briskly down a concrete ramp toward a Hatteras sport charter. He is obsessed. Determined. Darian trots along behind him. She's holding up pretty well, considering.
59) 2) dialog: I'm gonna crash a party out on Catalina. Marcon will be there. He swings a bag of gear onto the boat.   Starts to store it.
59) 7) dialog: No, honey. Not now. There's some big shots involved in this mess, and it's my word against theirs. If I blab to the cops, your mom and dad will disappear and they'll never find the bodies. (beat) I'm sorry, Darian.
59) 9) dialog: What I do... is confront Conrad Marcon and threaten to go to the cops, unless he gives them back.
59) 11) dialog: Beats me, but I think it's what your dad would do.
59) 13) dialog: Me, too, honey. His gear stashed, he turns to Darian.   Tries a smile.
59) 14) dialog: So... why'd you come to me, anyhow?
59) 16) dialog: What?
59) 21) dialog: I'll get them back, kiddo.   I'll get them back.
63) 3) dialog: Okay, hot shit, let's do it.
64) 0) text: Jimmy emerges from the cabin.    Heads for the rail. A voice calls out:
64) 2) dialog: Goddammit, I told you to go home!
64) 4) dialog: Fine, whatever. Just stay here. With the boat.
64) 8) dialog: Anything funny happens, get the fuck out of here. Darian takes the keys.   Frowns, says:
64) 10) dialog: I feel terrible.
64) 12) dialog: I was.   I kicked the habit.
64) 14) dialog: This morning.    Stay here. He swings over the side, onto the dock.
64) 16) dialog: Thanks, kid.    You're a fuckin' inspiration.
67) 0) text: Jimmy is strolling along a hedge behind the house. Looking for a back entrance. He hears VOICES, approaching. Pulls up short. Ducks into the shadows. Senator Baynard goes by, with two bodyguards. Brisk. Businesslike.
68) 0) text: Jimmy casts off the lines. Heads for the cockpit. Darian is inside.
68) 1) dialog: Gimmee the keys, kiddo.
68) 6) dialog: The Senator's here, and he's leaving by the back door. I'm gonna follow him. He keys the ignition.
68) 7) dialog: Get off the boat.
68) 9) dialog: Darian, Goddammit -- She runs below decks.
68) 11) dialog: Okay.     Shit.   Okay.   Easy.   Shit. He throttles forward. The Hatteras pulls away from the dock.
72) 0) text: Jimmy Dix is clearly lost. He bangs his fist in frustration.
72) 1) dialog: Goddammit, I lost him.     I can't see a fucking thing.
72) 3) dialog: Oh, yeah, little Miss Know-It-All.
72) 8) dialog: Watch your mouth.
76) 0) text: Jimmy has had about enough.    He sighs with frustration. Stares ahead into the fog.
76) 4) dialog: All we're doing is burning gas. Sorry, kid, I'm turning back. The words are barely out of his mouth when he hears a throbbing NOISE, growing louder... Darian looks up puzzled.
76) 7) dialog: Holy fucking shit! Rotor wash sprays in every direction. The noise is deafening.
78) 4) text: Jimmy's BOAT ROARS out of the fog... And suddenly he's in a world of shit. Less than fifty yards to port is Milo's yacht. Fifty years to starboard is the Senator's Marlineer.
78) 5) dialog: Oh, wow.    We're fucked. He GUNS the ENGINE.     Spins the wheel, banks to port.
84) 9) dialog: Shit.    I don't believe it.
84) 14) dialog: Keep the wheel like this!   Don't let it move! She grabs the wheel. Jimmy bends down. Opens a compart- ment. Takes out the boat's anchor. Metal hook, attached to seventy yards of chain. He hefts it like a grappling hook.
84) 15) dialog: Third and long, baby, lets' go... And, sure, his left arm isn't his good arm -- But, boy, does he heave that anchor. It soars through space, chain playing out behind it... Hits water, thirty yards past Hallenbeck -- Who turns, sees the anchor skimming toward him over the waves.
85) 1) text: Hallenbeck thrusts forward, hooks his bound hands around the passing anchor and whoosh -- ! He is catapulted forward, jerked like a rag puppet. BULLETS CHOP the water where he just was. He skims over the waves. Bounced. Battered. Trailing behind Jimmy at fifty miles an hour. Jimmy and Darian begin to haul him in. Struggling. Straining. The boat rushing headlong, driverless. With a last, desperate surge of energy -- They drag Hallenbeck over the side. Into the boat.
85) 11) dialog: Got any ideas?
85) 13) dialog: What?
85) 19) dialog: What the fuck? They're peeling off. Why? A pause... then it hits Joe like a thunderbolt:
85) 21) dialog: Port?
85) 23) dialog: Shit fuck piss! They almost make it. As it is, they avoid a head-on.   Instead, they hit broadside. A sickening CRUNCH -- ! Jimmy and Joe are thrown from their feet. A momentary glimpse of faces rushing past -- Horrified tourists -- And then the ferry is behind them. Jimmy gets up. Staggers to the controls. Pushes the throttle. The boat lurches forward -- Then SPUTTERS. Fizzles. He swears violently.
85) 27) dialog: We're on half power, we lost an engine!
86) 1) dialog: swears again.   Bangs his fist.
86) 2) dialog: We're sitting ducks. They got sonar. They can find us.
86) 4) dialog: Fuck me. The two men watch, helpless, as the helicopter descends, the Co-Pilot taking aim with a LAWS rocket.
86) 8) text: They move like sleepwalkers to the cockpit window. Stare in disbelief. Joe looks at Jimmy. Jimmy at Joe. Debris rains down.
87) 0) text: Jimmy, Joe and Darian are on deck, chugging through the wreckage. Darian clings to her father's arm, in shock. Hallenbeck sees something in the distance.    Squints:
87) 2) dialog: That's Baynard's boat!
87) 5) dialog: What is it?
87) 10) dialog: Holy fucking shit!!
93) 0) text: All business now. Deadly serious. Jimmy and Joe stare ahead through the windshield.    Grim Tense. In the back seat sits the coveted suitcase.
93) 1) dialog: Your prints are all over that boat. What happens when they find the bodies inside?
94) 7) dialog: (clears his throat)
97) 2) dialog: Are you crazy? That's a cop!     You don't punch cops!
98) 0) text: The cop is bound and gagged in the corner.      Unconscio Hallenbeck moves hurriedly. Not a second to waste. Pulls a dark turtleneck from a drawer. Rips off the sleeve. Throws it to Jimmy.
98) 3) dialog: The trigger's the little black thing.
98) 9) dialog: What are you gonna use?
99) 0) text: Jimmy emerges, starts across the lawn. Pulls up short. Stares ahead at:
100) 0) text: Hallenbeck snaps a full magazine into the rifle. Stuffs extras into a black Windbreaker. Hears a NOISE. Looks up, expecting Jimmy -- Draws a sharp breath:
101) 0) text: Jimmy Dix is on the floor, and Marcon is kicking him savagely. Pointed alligator boots lashing out. Again and again.
101) 3) dialog: Nobody knows. Just... just me... and Hallenbeck...
101) 9) dialog: Nobody... Marcon raises the poker. Brings it down on Jimmy's broken arm.
104) 0) text: Marcon stirs the fireplace logs, stoking the blaze. Replaces the poker. Crosses to his desk and sits. Jimmy is on the carpet, delirious.   Out of it. Marcon presses a button.   An armed HARDGUY appears.
104) 19) dialog: Hurts like hell. Marcon finishes writing. Hallenbeck snatches up the address. Stows it in his pocket.
104) 21) text: Can you walk, Jimmy?
104) 22) dialog: Yeah... I think so -- Joe, behind you...! Too late.    A revolver is cocked a foot from Joe's head.
104) 32) dialog: Shit. This is the drunk guy you slugged, look what you did to his face! Marcon, meanwhile, is positively livid.   He snaps at Baynard:
104) 44) dialog: She wasn't a hooker, dickhead.
104) 47) dialog: We'd rather watch yours.   It's goofy-lookin'. Marcon has had enough.   He pounds his fist on the desk.
104) 49) dialog: Any bright ideas, Joe?
104) 51) dialog: Excuse me, could you give him a minute? He's trying to think of a way out of this.
104) 69) dialog: (sotto) I don't think it's working, Joe. Try another one.
104) 71) dialog: Fuck you, Joe, I'm not just gonna stand here and die. Mr. Marcon, he's lying. We do have the money, but it's not in a car, it's in a storage locker. I have the key on me. I'l hand it over if you let me go. Hallenbeck stares in disbelief. The kid's actually trying something.
104) 76) dialog: It's stashed in my shorts.
104) 78) dialog: Sure.   Slow and easy. Jimmy reaches inside his jeans. Slowly, cautiously pulls something out, concealed in his fist. We see, but Marcon doesn't: It's a shredder shell. He holds it in his fist.
104) 79) dialog: Promise you'll let me go.
104) 81) dialog: Oh, yeah? Well, that's too bad. See, it's one of those new plastic keys. The kind that melt...? And, with that, he hurls it into the fire. So fast that nobody can see just what he threw.
104) 82) dialog: I guess nobody gets the money. The two hardguys rush to the fireplace.
104) 88) dialog: Hey.   Short notice, best I could do.
104) 90) dialog: Learned it from a pro.     Come on.
106) 0) text: Jimmy and Joe come racing out of the house, just in time to see Marcon's taillights disappearing up the canyon.
106) 1) dialog: Son of a bitch!
110) 2) dialog: I'm new at this, Joe.   How do we do it?
111) 0) text: Jimmy and Joe. Side by side. Walking.      Expressionless They round a bend in the hall.
112) 0) text: The door flies open.    Doesn't hit the wall. Something stops it. Joe doesn't blink. He puts the rifle against the panel. FIRES three SHOTS through the wood. Keeps going. A body falls out from behind the door. Joe doesn't even look. The body sits up.    Not dead yet... Jimmy comes through the door.     SHOOTS him. Follows Joe. One more door to go.    Thick.   Soundproofed metal. It isn't locked.    Joe yanks it open.   Steps inside.
113) 0) text: Sarah is now dressed, as Joe supports her across the sidewalk toward the stolen Mercedes. He turns to Jimmy. Hands him a set of keys.
113) 2) dialog: Where do you want me to go?
113) 4) dialog: Yes, massah. He moves off into the parking lot. Hallenbeck says to Sarah.
118) 0) text: Jimmy Dix is actually on the freeway, driving, when he looks across the center divider and sees Hallenbeck.
118) 1) dialog: I don't fucking believe it. He swerves over to the side and meanwhile
118) 13) dialog: The car's over on the other side. C'mere, I want to show you something.
119) 0) text: Jimmy and Joe stand in the breakdown lane next to the rented Subaru. Jimmy points to the shattered window.
119) 1) dialog: Somebody broke in and swiped the suitcase from the back seat. Had to be Marcon, right? There is a pause. They both stare at the car. Two million. Down the drain. Except, after a beat... they begin to laugh. First chuckling, then chortling.. Now it's go-for-broke. Jimmy hoots. Joe howls. Jimmy pulls out a key and opens the trunk -- You can guess what's inside.
119) 2) dialog: Son of a bitch got the wrong one!
122) 0) text: The suitcase sits on a table. Jimmy and Joe contemplate it over a bottle of Seagrams V.O.
122) 1) dialog: So.
122) 3) dialog: (clears his throat) You gonna keep it? Hallenbeck nods.
122) 8) dialog: How much? Hallenbeck frowns. Opens the case. Reaches in -- And plucks out two crisp $100 bills. Stuffs them in a pocket. Jimmy stares at him.
122) 10) dialog: Shit, Joe... I got all the money I need. He shoves it back into the center.    Joe nods.
122) 12) dialog: I maybe could handle that.        For awhile. He pours a drink.    Raises his glass on high:
122) 13) dialog: Alex the detective. He drinks.
124) 0) text: Jimmy and Joe walk side by side. Away from us. Slightly drunk. Palms wave lazily. A sweaty Santa rings a bell.
124) 2) dialog: Why?
