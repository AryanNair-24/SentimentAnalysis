31) 33) dialog: I’m fine. I came out of store twenty-four and these guys came grabbed me and kind of shoved me and were grabbing for my purse but the store owner saw it and started yelling-- and I’m at the point where I felt like, “I’ve been in the big leagues, you guys are JV criminals” and they ran off and I went home and went to bed.

34) 8) dialog: Me, too. (puts down tools) I’m at the point where I’ve started having dreams about you. She stands, brushing away dirt, moving to him.
34) 9) dialog: I dreamt you worked at the bank. In one we were both barefoot and then you were six years old. You're a little boy in a lot of them. The thing is-- you’re never a real person. You never have any context. You’re just vapor. And it made me realize, I know you really well but you’re not real. It’s like I invented you. Are you real Doug?
34) 11) dialog: All I have is a cell number. It’s like al-Qaeda. I don’t have your address, no house to drive past and torment myself and wonder, ‘is he home?’
34) 15) dialog: No. I want to do what girls do: subtly go through your things. I want to rifle your medicine cabinet, stand for five minutes in your closet. Am I crazy? Are you married?
34) 17) dialog: Well? That’s what I mean. (beat) Just tell me if I’m making a mistake, Doug. I’1l still make it. I just want to know.

39) 3) dialog: Mostly good.
39) 6) dialog: No...They just think it’s a rebound. I’m like, rebound from what? The robbery? Anyway, I feel sort of estranged from them now. I think that’s what they’re picking up on. I’ve changed. I can feel it. They still have this, carelessness- which I sort of envy but at the same time I hardly understand anymore. It feels like I'm leaving them behind. (CONTINUED)
39) 10) dialog: My brother died on a day like this. I was holding his hand. The sun is bright through the shop.
39) 11) dialog: Now on really sunny days I think about someone dying. That’s wrong, isn’t it?
39) 13) dialog: Good. Then you'll miss me while I’m gone. Claire disappears inside to the bathroom. Doug sits back, tipping his chair, looking up at a jet trail in the sky. Someone pokes him in the back of the neck.

39) 81) dialog: What?
39) 83) dialog: What is it? He says this plainly and honestly.
39) 85) dialog: That is...a great line. How girls are there in Charlestown whose hearts were broken with that line? He laughs.
39) 87) dialog: I saw your picture yesterday. This slows him. His instinct kicks in.
39) 89) dialog: Pretty sure, yeah. He holds her look. She’s giving him nothing.
