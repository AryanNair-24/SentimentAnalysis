As THE VAN LURCHES FORWARD, he ties it around her head as a blindfold. He makes a fist and drives it -- STOPPING JUST SHORT OF HER NOSE. Making sure she can’t see. He sits back. STUDYING her with impunity.

There were a lot of kids in that ice cream parlor, faces pressed to the glass, couldn’t wait to grow up and be like the big guys--some did, some went another way. I was scared of those guys.

He had stopped crying and he was sitting there watching TV on our little black and white with no sound. I think he just didn’t know what else to do. He saw me standing in the doorway and he just goes, “your mother left. She’s not comin’ back.” Just like that. Smokin’ cigarettes and eatin a tv dinner at six in the mornin’. (beat) We lost our dog the year before. I thought “lost” was a place people went. I wanted to make these posters so if she was lost she could call us like they did when someone found our dog. To this day my father will tell you he helped me make those posters. But he didn’t. He sat there and drank a case of beer and I went around by myself on school street asking people if they seen my mother.

The driver of the front car gets out, our guys go for their guns, we reveal the driver is DEZ in the ‘switch car’ and our guys are readying themselves to shoot it out with the pursuing policeman.
