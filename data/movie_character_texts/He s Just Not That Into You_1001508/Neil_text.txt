14) 1) text: Ben gets in the car, bag in hand, and joins NEIL, 40, arty and kind looking, who's behind the wheel.
14) 10) dialog: So, who was that?
14) 14) dialog: Yeah right.
14) 17) text: Neil looks at him, smirk growing.
14) 20) text: Neil starts the car and they pull away.
15) 1) text: Neil walks into a vast space. Nice art, a cozy yet architectural look - a cool place to live.
15) 3) dialog: Hey, babe.    You here?
15) 9) dialog: Everything OK?
15) 12) text: Neil gets up again.
15) 14) dialog: You want some tea or something?
15) 26) dialog: That's great. I've always liked that Devon guy. That's really great.
15) 31) dialog: Yeah.
15) 35) dialog: No, babe.
15) 38) dialog: Going against nature is like that cat who started nursing that monkey. We're just two people who aren't married.
15) 43) dialog: I actually think the odds of having a successful relationship increase by not getting married. Look at my parents - all marriage got them was thirty two years of misery and joint checking.
15) 47) dialog: Like I've always told you - I love you - and we don't need a marriage certificate to legitimize our relationship.
15) 51) dialog: Lemme get you some tea.
35) 1) text: Beth opens the door to find NEIL, standing on the couch in his socks, hanging a PAINTING.
35) 3) dialog: Hey babe, is this straight?
35) 7) dialog: I told you I'd do it weeks ago.   You don't like it there?
35) 18) dialog: It's the image, isn't it? I didn't see it before, but - you're right - it totally looks like a sagging boob.
35) 21) dialog: You want me to take it down?
35) 25) dialog: Is this a trick?
35) 28) text: Neil laughs.
35) 32) dialog: No.     It was just - I was just--
35) 36) dialog: Or there is the possibility that I just don't really believe in the concept of -
35) 39) text: Beth tries to hold back her tears. Neil looks stunned. He hops down off the couch and goes to her.
35) 41) dialog: Honey, where is all this coming from?
35) 50) text: Neil looks at her.    She looks at him.
35) 53) text: Beth looks at Neil.    There is a long, painful SILENCE.
52) 1) text: Ben walks to a boat at the end of the dock. He stands, unsure, before deciding to KNOCK on the side of the boat. NEIL emerges - unshaven, possibly unshowered.
52) 3) dialog: Ah.     My first visitor.
52) 7) dialog: Well, this was supposed to be just for Beth and I - for our retirement. Leave our jobs. Sell the house. Take off.
52) 15) text: Neil is clearly having a tough time. Ben doesn't know what to say. They're silent for a second.
52) 17) dialog: Sorry. Where are my manners? Permission to board granted. I'll show you around.
53) 1) text: CLOSE ON: A cigarette being lit. WIDEN to reveal Neil smoking on the upper deck of his boat, steering it out into the bay.   Ben stands across from him, looking on.
53) 3) dialog: (re: cigarette) Sorry.
53) 6) text: Neil switches to his left hand, away from Ben.
53) 8) dialog: So Janine sent you to check on me?
53) 12) dialog: Any message from Beth?
53) 13) text: Ben shakes his head no.    Neil seems disappointed.
53) 17) dialog: Her sister's what?
53) 20) text: Neil is now LAUGHING HARD.
53) 22) dialog: You said funeral.
53) 30) text: Neil LAUGHS HARDER.    Even Ben sees the humor.
53) 32) dialog: The marriage thing is weird, man. I never thought Beth would give me an ultimatum.
53) 36) dialog: Right. I forgot. That's how Janine got you to bite the bullet.
53) 39) text: Neil looks at Ben, curious.
53) 41) dialog: Do you regret it?
53) 45) dialog: So you're happy? You'd say you're happily married?
53) 46) text: Ben looks at Neil as if he's crazy.
53) 49) text: Neil takes a drag and looks out over the harbor.
88) 16) text: She looks to the sink and sees the back of a man, doing the last of the dishes. He turns around. It's NEIL.
88) 18) dialog: The dishes are all put away. There's a load of laundry still drying, but the other one is folded on top of the washer.
88) 21) dialog: I remembered what your dad likes, but I tried to get healthy stuff, too.
88) 22) text: Beth just looks at Neil, stunned.
88) 30) dialog: Ben told me.    I just - I wanted to help.
88) 33) dialog: I know how much you love him.      But it's gonna be OK.
93) 1) text: Neil lies on the bed, reading. The room is pretty messy - a lot of clothes strewn around. There is a KNOCK at the door. Neil gets up to answer it. It's Beth.
93) 10) dialog: Hey.
93) 14) dialog: Oh no.
93) 17) text: Neil laughs.
93) 20) text: Neil ushers her in, shuts the door.    Beth looks around.
93) 24) dialog: Of course. I really care about your dad. And I really love you. Even if I can't give you what you want.
93) 27) text: Neil looks at her - unsure of her meaning.
93) 31) dialog: And you'd really be OK if we take the marriage thing off the table?
93) 42) dialog: I always have -
93) 46) dialog: I do.
93) 49) dialog: So, I get to move back in?
93) 54) dialog: What? You're just mad at me, and you're taking it out on the pants.
93) 58) dialog: OK. We're not getting married, but I'm chucking the pants.
104) 1) text: Beth and Neil's place. Neil comes in holding a few MESSILY PACKED BOXES. He is clearly moving back in.
104) 3) dialog: How did all this stuff fit in here fine before?
104) 7) text: Neil collapses on the couch. Beth sits next to him, a pile of clothes on her lap. She looks down and laughs.
104) 18) dialog: What?    I have no idea what you're -
104) 22) dialog: That's really gonna free up a lot of space.
104) 25) text: Neil watches her, smiling, as she walks across the room.
104) 27) dialog: Okay, okay. You win. Just check to make sure there's nothing in the pockets before we give them away.
104) 28) text: Beth dutifully puts her hands in the pockets. And then she FEELS SOMETHING. Her face registers curiosity as she pulls out - A BLACK VELVET RING BOX. Beth looks at it, and when she looks up - Neil's down ON ONE KNEE.
104) 30) dialog: I love you so much. So much. I want to make you happy. I need to make you happy for me to even have a shot at being happy, too.
104) 31) text: Tears stream down Beth's face.      Neil pops open the bo revealing an ENGAGEMENT RING.
104) 33) dialog: Will you marry me?
104) 34) text: Neil gets up and KISSES HER. They kiss, passionately, for a long moment. And then:
109) 1) text: Out on the sparkling water, Neil's boat. As we get closer, we see garlands on the rails, on the bough. Even closer and we see - Beth on the arm of her father. He escorts her down a mini aisle. On the bough of the boat - is a TINY WEDDING. About six guests. And Neil, waiting for Beth at the altar.
