11) 1) text: ANNA, hot in an earthy sort of way, heads down the aisle. She holds her cell phone in one hand - a BOTTLED WATER and a BAG OF SOY NUTS in the other.
11) 3) dialog: Conor, that's so nice.     Thank you.
11) 4) text: As Anna gets to the checkout, there's one person ahead of her. He looks back to see her - he's BEN, good looking and supremely likeable. They share a smile.
11) 8) dialog: Hmm?
11) 12) dialog: (into phone) Hold on.
11) 15) dialog: You've only got one thing.
11) 20) dialog: (into phone) Hey, let me call you right back.
11) 33) dialog: Come on. Seriously. I just deposited money today. There's no way -
11) 41) dialog: What?
11) 44) text: The cashier reaches under the register and pulls out an IGLOO COOLER and hands it to Anna. She BEAMS.
11) 46) dialog: Are you kidding?
11) 49) text: Anna looks to Ben.   She looks like she's about to burst.
11) 51) dialog: I swear to god, this is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me.
11) 56) dialog: Is that sad?
11) 64) text: Anna smiles wide, admiring her cooler.    Then -
11) 66) dialog: Wait, no. I can't accept this. You were here first. I didn't win at all.
11) 69) text: Anna throws her arms around him and hugs him.
11) 71) dialog: Thank you SO MUCH.
13) 1) text: We TILT up to find Anna and Ben. Anna looks at her phone, presses IGNORE and stashes it in her purse.
13) 3) dialog: Sorry.   What was I saying?
13) 12) text: Ben opens his GUM and offers Anna a piece.     She takes and laughs, a bit embarrassed.
13) 14) dialog: Was I? Little intense for grocery store chatter. Sorry.
13) 18) dialog: That would be - amazing.      What are you - like my savior?
13) 19) text: Anna digs through her purse to find a piece of paper. She writes down her number, and holds it out to him. He looks at it, contemplating. He doesn't take it.
13) 23) dialog: Don't do what? Help struggling singers?
13) 26) text: Anna takes the slip of paper and puts it away.
13) 28) dialog: Do you want to give me your card? That's legit. I bet you're allowed to do that.
13) 34) text: We see Anna and Ben talking.     They shake hands awkward and Ben HEADS TOWARDS US.
32) 1) text: Anna and MARY, beautiful but doesn't know it, sit in side by side pedicure chairs. Anna holds a BUSINESS CARD.
32) 3) dialog: It is impossible not to like this guy. I'm pretty sure he was heavily flirting with me outside Eddie's, and then he tells me he's married. You'd think I'd be pissed, but I literally could not stop myself from liking him.
32) 7) dialog: I realize that. I keep trying to force myself to picture him in some church saying vows to some woman, and even that doesn't cool it off. What is my problem?
32) 18) dialog: You're right. I'm calling him.
32) 19) text: Anna pulls her feet out of the pedicure bath, goes in a private corner, and dials her cell phone.
32) 21) dialog: Hey, Ben.    This is Anna Marks.
32) 25) dialog: Well, I was just taking you up on your offer. You said you might know someone who could help me out and I thought we could discuss it -- over coffee?
32) 26) text: Anna waits for a response. On the other end she hears some rustling, some silence, definitely awkwardness.
32) 29) text: Anna takes this in - STUNNED. She hangs up. Her eyes sting. She can't face Mary so she just stares at weird, bleached out photos of nails and HOLDS BACK THE TEARS.
33) 1) text: Conor opens the door to find Anna standing there.
33) 11) dialog: Cool.
33) 15) dialog: Well, you know. I was just thinking about you.
34) 1) text: Anna is stretched out with a wine glass in hand, feet in Conor's lap. He rubs her feet as they talk.
34) 3) dialog: Your turn.
34) 7) dialog: There are four. Sexy, smart, funny or cute. And each person can only be two. Like Sarah Jessica Parker is funny and sexy. Or Bill Clinton is sexy and smart.
34) 11) dialog: So, which am I?
34) 15) dialog: Smart and cute.
34) 21) dialog: No. Cute and sexy are in the looks column. No one wants to be in all one column.
34) 31) dialog: You're the best.
34) 32) text: Anna sits up, and moves to Conor. She looks at him, pulls him in for a nice, long HUG.
34) 34) dialog: I better go.
34) 37) text: Anna gives him a knowing look.
34) 41) dialog: I know. It's just - I'm fried.    Is that alright?
34) 44) text: Anna smiles and gets up. Conor reluctantly follows her to the door. She KISSES HIM ON THE LIPS, smiles, and leaves.
40) 1) text: Ben sits behind his desk, sifting through a pile of papers. We PAN around to Anna sitting across from him.
40) 5) dialog: It's cool.    You can call me when you find it.
40) 17) dialog: I know.   But a girl can dream.
40) 20) dialog: You're obviously too good of a guy.
40) 23) dialog: Why are you married, again?
40) 26) dialog: Seriously. Why? It'll be good for me. Tell me how you decided that you could not be without this other woman.
40) 30) dialog: Seriously?   You just caved?
40) 34) dialog: Really?
40) 47) text: Anna takes this in.
44) 2) text: As the candles are blown out, we widen to reveal: Anna and Conor siting at a cheap picnic table in a tiny backyard, across from MAYA - Anna's mom.
44) 3) text: As Maya refills her glass from a BOTTLE OF WINE, Anna grabs a GIFT from her bag - hands it to her mom.
44) 7) dialog: Mom - you always say that and I always get you something.
44) 12) dialog: It's no big deal.
44) 20) text: Anna takes the album and heads through the screen door.
44) 31) text: "Song to the Siren" plays as Anna returns to the table.
44) 38) dialog: Mom, please -
44) 45) text: Anna just looks at her - pleadingly.
44) 48) text: Anna goes inside.   Maya looks to Conor, takes a sip.
44) 51) text: She leans back, puts out her cigarette as Anna returns with A PICTURE. She hands it to Conor.
44) 52) text: INSERT: MAYA, in her early twenties. Black and white - somewhere in New York. The resemblance to Anna is scary.
44) 63) text: Conor looks down at the picture, then back up to Anna.
44) 66) text: He looks from Maya to Anna.     Maya stands up.
44) 72) text: Anna looks to Conor apologetically.    He just smiles.
45) 1) text: Anna and Conor walk to the front door of her apartment.
45) 3) dialog: Thanks again for coming with me.        You make it so much easier.
45) 7) dialog: Yeah, well - cool's not always what you're looking for in a mom.
45) 19) dialog: Ugh. I'm just beat. I wanna put on sweats and get in bed.
45) 22) text: Anna gives him a smile, opens her front door.
45) 24) dialog: I'll call you tomorrow, OK?
49) 1) text: Anna's rolling up mats, etc. as a sweaty Ben approaches.
49) 5) dialog: You came to my class.
49) 15) dialog: You called and asked me.
49) 19) dialog: Because you said not to call back if it was my class. Which it was.
49) 23) text: Anna LAUGHS.
49) 25) dialog: Totally. A couple of innocent folks - by happenstance - doing their daily workout near one another.
49) 28) text: As Anna picks up her bag and walks past him -
49) 30) dialog: Wanna swim?
50) 1) text: Big indoor pool. Clearly closed, lights off.    Anna open the door with a KEY, Ben follows.
50) 5) dialog: I hear you. Am I supposed to not be friends with a guy just because he's married, and happens to have this insane smile and this ass that makes me want to dry hump?
50) 15) dialog: Classy, right?
50) 18) text: Anna sits at the edge of the pool.
50) 20) dialog: So, friends, right?
50) 23) text: And with that, Anna pulls off her top. And then her sweats. And, totally naked, slides into the pool.
50) 25) dialog: You wanna come in?
50) 29) dialog: OK.   You can just watch.
50) 33) text: Anna LAUGHS, and then dunks her head under the water.
57) 4) text: He gestures to a guest book on the kitchen island - next to which Anna stands. Conor joins her.
57) 6) dialog: This is insane. You're like the Liza Minelli of real estate.
57) 11) dialog: Alright.   Gotta run.
57) 21) dialog: Uh, no.   Just some stuff.    See you later?
57) 24) text: Conor goes in for a HUG, but Anna's not ready for it - so he just ends up grabbing her. It's awkward. She leaves, Conor tries to play it off, looks around the room.
58) 1) text: Cute studio apartment. And Ben is in the bed. Anna walks in from the bathroom, in a robe. Ben watches her.
58) 5) dialog: What?
58) 9) dialog: What?

58) 16) dialog: Why stop?

59) 3) dialog: I'm not picking out china patterns or anything - but I've never felt anything like this before.
59) 7) dialog: No, he's not leaving his wife for me. He's just - he's a good guy. And he can't really explore what we could be if he's lying to her.
59) 10) dialog: He's kind of leaving his wife for me. Is this crazy? This is totally crazy. We barely know each other.
59) 14) dialog: You're totally right.   It can happen.
59) 26) dialog: Well, what about texter?
59) 30) dialog: I doubt he has a stoma -
59) 34) dialog: So don't text.
59) 38) dialog: That's just mail -
59) 41) text: Anna, who is trying a different shade of nail polish on each finger, calmly looks up at Mary.
59) 43) dialog: So what about the singer guy?
59) 52) dialog: That's great.
79) 1) text: Anna SQUEEZES Ben's hand as they stride down the hallway to his office. Anna is trying to suppress a smile.
79) 3) dialog: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god...

80) 3) dialog: OH.    MY.   GOD.

80) 10) text: Ben smiles, and pulls Anna to him.
80) 12) dialog: Thank you.     Thank you so much.
80) 13) text: With that, they start to KISS. It gets heated. CLOTHES START TO COME OFF. MOSTLY ANNA'S. They make their way over to the LEATHER SOFA.
80) 16) text: Anna smiles at the compliment. She starts to work on his shirt when: SOMEONE TRIES TO OPEN THE LOCKED DOOR.
80) 22) text: BEN FREEZES.    Literally freezes on top of Anna.
80) 24) dialog: Is -
80) 33) text: Ben FRANTICALLY puts his hands over Anna's mouth. Then, working with speed and precision, he GATHERS ALL OF ANNA'S THINGS and shoves her - NAKED - into the CLOSET. There isn't enough room to stand, so she has to sit. She looks up at Ben, he closes the closet door.
81) 1) text: Anna sits, holding back tears, as she listens closely.
81) 9) text: We HOLD ON Anna as she sits there, stonefaced.
83) 23) dialog: You make me sick to my stomach.    You are a disgusting excuse for a man -
83) 24) text: Anna pulls her clothes back on in a FURY.
83) 29) dialog: Are you kidding me? You will never lay a hand on me again. I may just be a piss poor girl from Dundalk who works at a gym - but I am so too good for you.
83) 30) text: Anna storms out.
85) 1) text: Anna stands in the cluttered kitchen of her mom's house. She writes out a CHECK, leaves it on the counter. She looks to the living room, where Maya sleeps on the couch. She watches her for a second, struggling with a blanket, before heading over to her. She crouches next to the couch, helps her adjust the blanket.
85) 3) dialog: I'm gonna go. I left the check on the counter. It should at least get you through this month.
85) 7) text: Maya closes her eyes again. Anna sits there, watching her. Anna's eyes start to fill with tears - quietly, she begins crying. Maya finally notices.
85) 10) text: Maya struggles to sit up and hug her. Anna sits next to her on the couch, still trying to get it together.
85) 20) dialog: No, it's not that. I mean - yes, I'm broke - but it's not that. It's just - (tearing up again) I'm just so lost mom. I've been seeing this guy - who is exciting and amazing and thoroughly unavailable. I thought he was - the one - but he turned out to be such an asshole.
85) 23) dialog: And then there's -
85) 27) dialog: Yeah. Who I'm so horrible to. But he takes it. And he's - there. Waiting. But I just don't want to - I don't know -
85) 30) text: Anna looks at her mother, guilty.
85) 34) dialog: Are you kidding? All you talk about are the things you didn't do, the people you wish you could have been with, the Tim Buckleys - anything but the life you actually had.
85) 38) text: Anna tries to process this.
85) 51) dialog: Like what?

86) 1) text: Anna lays on her bed, staring at the ceiling.

86) 10) dialog: Because we always call each other that.
86) 13) text: Anna doesn't have an answer for that.

97) 10) text: Conor smiles as Anna heads into the house.
98) 2) dialog: Weird - it totally reminds me of the house I grew up in. I bet there is a -
98) 3) text: Anna goes into a little nook off of the kitchen.   And pulls down a BUILT IN IRONING BOARD.

98) 11) text: Anna looks up to Conor, who is just watching her.
98) 13) dialog: So, when do all the fabulous homosexual couples start arriving?
98) 17) dialog: His girlfriend?

98) 25) text: Anna turns to face Conor, trying to put this together.
98) 28) text: Conor takes her hands in his.   Anna starts to PANIC.
98) 38) text: Anna looks at him. And at the PULL DOWN IRONING BOARD. She looks at the ironing board a long time, before turning back to Conor, holding back tears.
98) 40) dialog: I can't do this Conor.
98) 44) dialog: No. I mean this. Any of this. What you're saying - what you're offering - is what every girl wants. It's what I've always wanted. It's just -
98) 45) text: Anna looks at him for a long time, not knowing how to say this. Conor looks at her, struggling, and suddenly sees it in her face. The answer he's been looking for. It all dawns on him in an instant.
98) 48) text: Anna NODS sadly.   Conor takes this in.   A LONG BEAT.
98) 52) dialog: Okay.
98) 55) text: Anna LAUGHS, and it breaks the tension.   Conor smiles.
98) 58) text: Anna goes to Conor and HUGS him.
103) 1) text: A speakeasy from the 1900s that hasn't changed much. A PIANO starts to play on a tiny stage - empty. And then - a terrified but determined Anna takes her place in front of the mic. And begins to SING.
108) 1) text: A beautiful sunny day on the harbor. Anna's song fades out, and the sound of Gigi's voice fades up.
113) 6) text: We see it's Anna, walking with a NEW GUY - it's clear it's a first date. They stop at the corner, exchange an awkward hug. As they turn to go their separate ways -

113) 12) text: Anna walks down the hill, the skyline of Baltimore in front of her.
