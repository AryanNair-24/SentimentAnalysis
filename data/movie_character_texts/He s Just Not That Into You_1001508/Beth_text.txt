15) 4) text: We PAN over to a couch - where BETH is wrapped in a throw blanket, watching TV. She's got her hair in a messy bun.
15) 6) dialog: Hey honey.
15) 11) dialog: Yeah.   Just got off the phone.
15) 16) dialog: It was my baby sister.        She's getting married.
15) 27) text: Beth looks at him.    She doesn't look that happy.
15) 29) dialog: Do you think it's great?
15) 33) dialog: So, you think it's great that they're getting married, but you never feel like we're going against nature or something by not getting married?
15) 39) text: Beth manages a weak smile.
15) 41) dialog: Right.
15) 45) dialog: Yeah, I know. I get that.
15) 49) dialog: Yeah.
15) 58) text: He exits. Beth starts to CRY, but quickly dries her tears, and forces herself to pull it together.
21) 24) text: The girls look up to find BETH standing there, listening.
21) 26) dialog: Remember the days when you guys at least pretended to be working when I came in?
21) 27) text: Beth heads to her office.   Janine and Gigi follow.
21) 29) dialog: Janine, how's the press release?
21) 35) dialog: Maybe a shade heavy on the alliteration - but otherwise good. (to Gigi) Where are we with the company newsletter?
21) 38) text: Beth looks at Gigi, more sympathetic friend than boss.
21) 47) dialog: Look, after my first date with Neil, I called him. There are no rules anymore. Why should you have to wait for him to get off his ass?
30) 20) text: Beth comes out of her office and looks at Gigi.
30) 22) dialog: Please come in my office before the others see that you have mini muffin stuck in your hair.
31) 1) text: Gigi paces in front of Beth's desk.
31) 5) dialog: I thought that guy was a process server.
31) 9) dialog: Okay...
31) 19) text: Gigi sits down, spent.   But Beth has been listening.
31) 21) dialog: OK. So let me see if I understand. What you're saying is that when people tell me about some girl they know who dated a guy for thirteen years, and then he finally married her -- that's the exception. And the rule is that guys - like Neil - who are with girls - like me - for seven years without getting married - are never getting married.
31) 22) text: Beth is serious.   Gigi freezes, tries to backtrack.
31) 25) text: Off Beth, knowing it's about her, too.
35) 1) text: Beth opens the door to find NEIL, standing on the couch in his socks, hanging a PAINTING.
35) 5) dialog: Why are you hanging that?
35) 9) dialog: I love it there. But just - stop.
35) 19) text: Beth is silent.
35) 23) dialog: No.     I want you stop doing anything nice.
35) 27) dialog: No. I need you to stop being nice to me - unless you're gonna marry me after.
35) 30) dialog: Is that funny?
35) 34) dialog: See, you can't keep being nice to me and I can't keep pretending like this is something that it's not. We've been together over seven years. You know me. You either want to marry me or you don't.
35) 38) dialog: BULLSHIT! BULLSHIT! Bullshit for every woman who's been told by some guy that he doesn't believe in marriage just to see him turn around eight months later and marry some twenty four year old girl he met at the gym. Bullshit.
35) 39) text: Beth tries to hold back her tears. Neil looks stunned. He hops down off the couch and goes to her.
35) 49) dialog: From the place that I have been hiding from you for the last five years because I didn't want to seem demanding, or clingy or psycho or whatever. So I never ask. But now I'm going to ---
35) 52) dialog: Are you ever going to marry me?
35) 53) text: Beth looks at Neil.    There is a long, painful SILENCE.
35) 55) dialog: I can't do this anymore.
39) 1) text: PAIGE, blonde and angelic, looks on as LAURA, CATHERINE, and Beth pull on matching coral dresses.
39) 17) dialog: Why again do you need to get married so fast?
39) 26) text: Everyone FREEZES.    And looks at BETH.   Big silence.
39) 30) dialog: It's OK.    Neil and I are actually - done - anyway.
39) 38) text: But before Beth can even answer --
39) 48) dialog: You guys, it's cool. I'm fine.    So I lost a little time. Big deal.
39) 49) text: Beth grabs her purse and starts for the door.
39) 56) dialog: Exactly.
39) 57) text: Beth exits, still wearing a half-sewn bridesmaid's dress.
54) 1) text: We PAN down one of the long tables to find Beth, SMACKING a crab with a mallet. HARD. AND LOUD. The others at the table turn to look at her, annoyed. And that's when we see - there seems to be a party and SPEECH underway.
54) 4) text: Beth's sister, Paige, smiles.
54) 13) text: The cousin WINKS at Beth.   Beth goes white.
54) 19) text: Mixed reaction from the crowd as Ken puts the mic down. He starts to return to his table - when he sees Beth trying to make a sneaky exit. He catches up to her.
54) 23) dialog: I know.    And even he's married.
54) 27) dialog: I'm your oldest daughter, and I'm the only one not married. If this was Fiddler on the Roof you'd have to sacrifice me or something.
54) 28) text: Ken laughs and puts his arm around Beth.
54) 32) dialog: Why not?
54) 40) text: Beth's eyes go WIDE.
54) 42) dialog: I don't think you're supposed to say that.
54) 46) dialog: That's OK.
54) 50) dialog: I know.
64) 2) text: Then Beth's sister, Laura, processes down the aisle with her husband, STEVEN. Beth's sister Catherine and her husband GEORGE are next. Big smiles all around.
64) 3) text: Then Beth appears at the end of the aisle with her escort - BUDDY, a 12 year old CHOCOLATE LAB, wearing a coral bow tie. Beth forces a smile as she processes with Buddy - who stops to piss on a chair leg. Beth is not happy.
65) 1) text: A lavish reception. Beth takes her seat next to DAN, 40s. Dan looks over at Beth's place card.
65) 5) dialog: Yep.
65) 9) dialog: Oh, yeah? So you are - (looks at his placecard) Dan.
65) 20) dialog: Hmmm?
65) 24) dialog: Really?
65) 27) text: Beth slaps on a fake smile, and grabs for the wine.
67) 1) text: Dinner is over. The dance floor is crowded. The bride, Paige, is out there. Beth's dad is dancing with her mom.
67) 2) text: Beth's dad gives Beth a wink as she heads onto to the dance floor with DOMINIC, 50s and fat.
67) 6) dialog: We actually broke up.
67) 10) dialog: Seven.   But yes, a long time.
67) 15) dialog: Eeew Dominic, gross.
67) 16) text: Beth swats Dominic on the arm, and he laughs. And then they are distracted by a COMMOTION ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

75) 7) text: Beth just keeps on walking.
76) 1) text: Beth walks by Paige, on the couch, and DEVON, Paige's new husband, on the floor, surrounded by a mess of VINYL RECORDS. He has an old BOBBY DARIN tune BLARING.
76) 3) dialog: You might wanna kill the volume just a smidge. My mom is finally taking a nap.
76) 7) dialog: Turn it the fuck down.
77) 1) text: The kitchen is a total MESS. Beth sets the dishes down in a precarious pile of other dishes, and sees her sisters Laura and Catherine at the kitchen table.
77) 3) dialog: I finally got mom to lay down in the spare room. All we have left to eat is some old jelly and ramen noodles, so after I tackle some of these dishes, maybe we can go to the store. Our new brother is trying to co-opt dad's property before he's even dead.
77) 10) dialog: And Laura, your husband would really like a beer to go with his fifth consecutive hour of the golf channel.
77) 11) text: Beth looks up. Laura is pointing to Catherine, who has her head in her hands. She's CRYING SOFTLY.

88) 10) dialog: Did anyone have time to run to the store?

88) 15) text: Beth, annoyed, goes into the kitchen. She puts down the dishes in shock. The kitchen is SPOTLESS.

93) 26) dialog: You're what I want.
93) 29) dialog: Our life together is what I want. Your love is what I want. Did you see those guys my sisters are married to? You are a better husband to me - without being married - than any of those real husbands will ever be. And that's enough for me.
93) 33) dialog: If you promise to love me and be committed to me -
93) 44) dialog: Wait, I'm not done. And snake the shower drain when my hair clogs it, and let me eat Wheat Thins in bed.

93) 51) dialog: I guess.   But, you cannot bring those.

104) 7) text: Neil collapses on the couch. Beth sits next to him, a pile of clothes on her lap. She looks down and laughs.

104) 20) dialog: We had a deal. These are not staying.
104) 24) dialog: They're going. I have a bag I'm taking to the Goodwill.
