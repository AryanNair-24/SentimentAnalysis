32) 1) text: Anna and MARY, beautiful but doesn't know it, sit in side by side pedicure chairs. Anna holds a BUSINESS CARD.
32) 5) dialog: But he's married.
32) 16) dialog: OK. There was this guy who worked in my dad's printing business. Married for fifteen years to a nice lady. And then he meets this woman at some church event. And he told my dad he just had never felt anything like it before. I mean, he had finally met the love of his life. So, he divorced his wife, and he's been with this other woman for 22 years and they are blissfully happy. I mean, what if you meet the love of your life - but you already married someone else? Are you supposed to pass them by?
32) 29) text: Anna takes this in - STUNNED. She hangs up. Her eyes sting. She can't face Mary so she just stares at weird, bleached out photos of nails and HOLDS BACK THE TEARS.
38) 1) text: The offices of Baltimore's gay weekly paper. The elevator opens - and in walks Mary, cheerful as always.
38) 6) text: Mary looks at them, smiling, enjoying their impatience.
38) 8) dialog: He asked me out.
38) 18) dialog: Well -
38) 22) dialog: Umm -
38) 26) dialog: He MySpaced me.
38) 33) dialog: Well, what am I supposed to do? Things have changed. People don't just meet organically anymore. If I want to make myself more attractive to the opposite sex, I don't go get a new haircut - I update my profile. That's just how it is.
38) 34) text: The guys look at her, starting to understand.   Mary's PHONE RINGS.
38) 36) dialog: Back to work.
38) 39) dialog: Ad sales - this is Mary.
38) 53) dialog: Hey.   So, did you see it?
38) 57) dialog: You gotta trust me. It's a burgeoning market. You're gonna make a fortune.
38) 62) dialog: It was either that or on the page with the personals. I made a call.
59) 1) text: Mary and Anna, in sweats and Ugg boots and dirty hair, both load their carts with cheap beauty products.
59) 5) dialog: This is crazy. I can't believe he's gonna leave his wife for you.
59) 8) text: Mary looks at her.
59) 12) dialog: I don't know.   Remember Becca, my sister's friend. Some guy waits on her at Bennigan's - by the end of the night they both knew they had found the one.
59) 16) dialog: Not for me.
59) 28) dialog: Texter has yet to make any verbal contact. I mean, this guy could have had surgery that left him without a voice box, breathing through a stoma, and I'd never know because I never actually hear his voice.
59) 32) dialog: That's not the point. The point is - I can't text. I'm not charming via text. My sarcasm doesn't come through, I can't type fast enough on the little phone keyboard --
59) 36) dialog: It's not just texting. It's email and voicemail and snail mail -
59) 40) dialog: Whatever. None of it's working. I've had a guy leave a voicemail for me at work, and then I call him back at home, and he emails me to my Blackberry, and then I text him to his cell and then he emails me to my home account from the plane phone -- and it just totally gets out of hand. I miss the days where you had one phone number with one answering machine that housed one cassette tape and either the cassette tape had a message from the guy or it didn't. That's it. Now you have to go around checking all your portals and get rejected by seven different technologies. It's exhausting.
59) 41) text: Anna, who is trying a different shade of nail polish on each finger, calmly looks up at Mary.
59) 50) dialog: Jude.    Yeah, I like him.
59) 54) dialog: Totally.     I felt like we connected.
60) 41) text: CLOSE ON: The TV screen as Mary Stuart Masterson (as WATTS) and Eric Stoltz (as KEITH) hang out in a garage.
62) 1) text: Mary sits at her desk, surrounded by her gays.    They ar all looking at her computer screen.
62) 6) dialog: There's no way he's already called - we only met for coffee last night. I mean we video iChatted. While holding coffee. Kinda like having coffee.
62) 11) dialog: And he told me he had a gig last night, so he probably got in real late. Did I tell you he was singer?
62) 14) text: Mary cradles the receiver with her shoulder and dials.
62) 17) text: Mary hits the SPEAKERPHONE button.
62) 20) text: Mary is clearly charmed.    The gays all SWOON.
62) 32) text: BEEP.    Mary BEAMS.
62) 35) text: Mary basks in the attention.       Then, ANOTHER BEEP.
62) 41) text: SOME RUSTLING NOISES, and a HANG UP, followed by a dial tone. Mary stares at the phone - then pushes a BUTTON.
66) 7) text: Gigi looks up to see Nathan and Bruce - Mary's gay coworkers who are now decked out in full-on Saturday night gay mode - standing next to her.
106) 2) text: The rickety Baltimore Blade float comes by. It's a very phallic "blade" with a A BUNCH OF YOUNG SHIRTLESS MEN dancing and waving. Mary rides the float, too, waving to the crowd with Nathan, Joshua and Bruce.
106) 21) dialog: Hey, Conor.    I'm Mary.
106) 22) text: Conor looks at Mary and SMILES. All of the gay men around them start to DANCE. LIKE REALLY, REALLY DANCE.
106) 24) dialog: It's so great to finally meet you in person.
106) 31) dialog: I'd love to.
110) 1) text: Mary sits at her desk, typing on her laptop.   ON THE SCREEN: MARY'S MYSPACE PROFILE.
110) 4) text: Mary hits a button and a box comes up, which reads: ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS MYSPACE PROFILE? Mary clicks "YES". MYSPACE PROFILE DELETED appears.
110) 5) text: Then, a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Mary gets up, grabs her little purse, and opens the door. IT'S CONOR. Mary smiles, her face barely able to contain her happiness.
