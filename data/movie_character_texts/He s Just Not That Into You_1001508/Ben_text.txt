13) 12) text: Ben opens his GUM and offers Anna a piece.     She takes and laughs, a bit embarrassed.
13) 16) dialog: It's OK. I might even be able to help you out. There's a guy at my firm who has exclusively music clients.
13) 21) dialog: OK. Look.      I'm married.   I don't do this.
13) 25) dialog: Help hot Pilates instructing singers who happen to be very charming.

32) 28) dialog: Look, I just...I can't Anna. You seem great. It's just - I don't know. I should go. Take care.
36) 1) text: Ben, our married guy from the grocery store, sits on the floor in a barely furnished room, and dials his cell.
36) 11) dialog: Hey, Anna. This is Ben. Look, I know it's been a little while since you called. I just - it took me by surprise. But I offered to help you with your career, and I don't see why I can't do that, right? So, give me a call. Maybe you can come by the office this week or something. Okay, take care. Bye.
36) 12) text: Ben hangs up. And STARES INTO SPACE until THE DOOR OPENS TO REVEAL: JANINE. Gigi's co-worker. And Ben's WIFE.

36) 17) dialog: Shit - you scared me.
36) 22) dialog: Yeah.   Everything's fine.   Why?
36) 27) dialog: No, sweetie.    Why?
36) 30) text: Ben puts his arm around Janine, and pulls her close.
36) 32) dialog: I'm not smoking. So, why don't we worry about what color we're gonna paint this room, instead of worrying about things that aren't happening?
36) 33) text: Janine contentedly curls up to Ben.
36) 43) dialog: Pink?   Seriously?
36) 46) text: Janine gives Ben a knowing look.   He gets it.
36) 48) dialog: You sure we're ready for this now?
36) 51) text: Ben looks at her and LAUGHS.
36) 53) dialog: You've already created the perfect family in this house, and we don't even have drywall.
36) 56) text: Ben looks at her, snuggled against him.
36) 58) dialog: I think we're almost ready to start talking about it.
36) 62) text: Ben LAUGHS.   She lets him.
38) 42) text: Conor sits on a bench, NEWSPAPER folded open on his lap.
40) 1) text: Ben sits behind his desk, sifting through a pile of papers. We PAN around to Anna sitting across from him.
40) 3) dialog: I know it's here somewhere. I spoke to George Lane in music, and he gave me this whole list of references for you.
40) 15) dialog: I swear I didn't lure you here under false pretenses.
40) 24) text: Ben LAUGHS.
40) 28) dialog: We'd been together since college. She gave me an ultimatum: we get married or we break up. So, we got married.
40) 32) dialog: It's complicated.
40) 36) dialog: You're a dick if you date a girl for too long, and don't marry her. But you marry her, and then you're an asshole for marrying her before you're ready. Shit - I don't know.
40) 46) dialog: You're really hot and I'm obviously attracted to you, but I guess the best I can do is eventually find this piece of paper, and call you, and hope I help in some small way with your career, and be happy about that.
49) 1) text: Anna's rolling up mats, etc. as a sweaty Ben approaches.
49) 3) dialog: So, we ran into each other.

49) 20) text: Ben recommits.
49) 22) dialog: We ran into each other.
49) 27) dialog: Exactly.   Thank you.
49) 31) text: Ben watches her go, not sure she's serious.
50) 1) text: Big indoor pool. Clearly closed, lights off.    Anna open the door with a KEY, Ben follows.
50) 3) dialog: I was just thinking - why can't we be friends? Am I not allowed to make friends anymore? Am I not allowed to be friends with hot people? What kind of reverse prejudice is that?
50) 13) dialog: I think I just fell in love.   A girl who talks about a dry hump.
50) 17) dialog: Classy is lame.
50) 22) dialog: Totally.
50) 27) dialog: I'm sorry.   I don't trust myself.
50) 32) dialog: You may be the best friend I've ever had.

51) 6) dialog: Different how?
51) 15) dialog: Well that's an odd thing to say.
51) 20) dialog: What?
51) 24) dialog: Are you serious? We have like eight thousand undocumented workers in this house daily. You find cigarettes, and you automatically assume they're mine?
51) 28) dialog: Honey, I'm not lying. And you are really freaking out. I think the renovation is getting to you because nothing is going on. Just please - relax.
51) 29) text: Ben walks away.    Off Janine, wanting to believe him.
52) 1) text: Ben walks to a boat at the end of the dock. He stands, unsure, before deciding to KNOCK on the side of the boat. NEIL emerges - unshaven, possibly unshowered.
52) 5) dialog: This boat is sick. How come you never invited me out before?
52) 15) text: Neil is clearly having a tough time. Ben doesn't know what to say. They're silent for a second.
52) 18) text: Ben smiles, steps on to the boat.
53) 1) text: CLOSE ON: A cigarette being lit. WIDEN to reveal Neil smoking on the upper deck of his boat, steering it out into the bay.   Ben stands across from him, looking on.
53) 5) dialog: It's OK.
53) 6) text: Neil switches to his left hand, away from Ben.
53) 10) dialog: Yeah.    Pretty much.
53) 13) text: Ben shakes his head no.    Neil seems disappointed.
53) 15) dialog: I think she's been busy getting ready for her sister's funeral though, so...
53) 19) dialog: Wedding.    Her sister's wedding.   What did I say?
53) 24) dialog: No, I didn't. Shit, did I?

58) 3) dialog: Wait.   Stop.
58) 7) dialog: Shit.   This is bad.
58) 11) dialog: I am so into you.
58) 14) dialog: I'm lying here watching you and I seriously have never felt this way before. I have to forcibly make my brain stop thinking about you. I mean, all the time.
58) 17) text: She looks at Ben.    He's not smiling.
58) 19) dialog: Because I don't do stuff like this.
58) 23) dialog: Like having sex with women who are not my wife.
58) 28) dialog: What's second of all?
58) 39) dialog: I thought second of all was going to make me feel better.
58) 45) dialog: I have to tell her.
58) 49) dialog: I have to tell her.
58) 54) dialog: I want to be with you. And I can't do that if I'm lying to her.
58) 57) text: As Ben pulls her to him, she lets a smile take hold.
63) 1) text: CLOSE ON: TWO SEEMINGLY IDENTICAL PLANKS OF WOOD. We pull back to reveal Ben and Janine, in the wide aisle of Home Depot, as Janine really studies the two pieces of wood. Finally, she POINTS to one of them.

63) 9) dialog: No. But it looks exactly the same - at like one one hundredth of the cost.
63) 21) dialog: But you can't even tell the difference.
63) 25) dialog: Then what's the point?
63) 29) dialog: I don't think it's pretending --
63) 30) text: Ben is making light.   But Janine is all business.
63) 33) text: Ben takes this in.   His cheeks start to burn.
63) 35) dialog: You're right. I'm sorry.      You're totally right.
63) 38) text: As she starts to steer their giant cart away, Ben just stands there, fused to the ground. Finally:
63) 40) dialog: I slept with someone.
63) 43) dialog: I --
63) 58) dialog: That is not why I -
63) 62) dialog: I'm sorry.    I'm so sorry.
63) 66) dialog: What?   Why does that matter?
63) 67) text: Janine turns to Ben.    She is IRATE.
63) 71) dialog: No.   No.    I haven't.
63) 74) dialog: Look, I talked to Neil, and he said I could stay on his boat for a while if --
63) 78) text: Ben looks confused, but is trying to roll with it.
63) 80) dialog: No. NO. I just assumed that you wouldn't want me to --
63) 92) dialog: I just assumed that once I told you, you would want me -- out.
63) 96) dialog: (almost a whisper) No.
63) 99) text: She heads down the aisle with the cart. Ben follows, confused - that didn't go how he thought it would.
79) 1) text: Anna SQUEEZES Ben's hand as they stride down the hallway to his office. Anna is trying to suppress a smile.

80) 5) dialog: This is really good news.
80) 9) dialog: Yep.    I was sitting right there.

80) 15) dialog: How is it that every time I see your body, I'm shocked at how beautiful it is?
80) 18) dialog: Dana, I need to go over the offering statement. Can I get a few minutes?
80) 19) text: Ben continues to remove his shirt as he talks.
80) 22) text: BEN FREEZES.    Literally freezes on top of Anna.
80) 33) text: Ben FRANTICALLY puts his hands over Anna's mouth. Then, working with speed and precision, he GATHERS ALL OF ANNA'S THINGS and shoves her - NAKED - into the CLOSET. There isn't enough room to stand, so she has to sit. She looks up at Ben, he closes the closet door.
80) 36) dialog: Shit. I told Dana to get this lock fixed. One sec.
80) 39) text: Ben re-buttons his shirt, gives the office a once over.
80) 41) dialog: I'd never get anything done if I didn't.
80) 42) text: Finally, Ben opens the door, and Janine is standing there, smiling.
80) 46) dialog: Of course.
80) 49) dialog: What are you doing?
80) 52) text: Ben goes to sit behind his desk, confused.
80) 54) dialog: OK.
80) 55) text: Janine, clearly a little nervous, goes to straddle Ben at his desk chair. Her skirt is way too long to do this, so she has to regroup, and hike up the skirt. Ben glances over at the closet.

80) 66) dialog: Honey, did you hear what I just said? I gotta get this offering statement out.
80) 67) text: Ben picks up some papers, but Janine is not giving up.
80) 70) text: Janine looks at Ben.   Ben is SILENT.

83) 5) dialog: I really gotta get this stuff done.
83) 9) text: She looks at Ben.    He has no choice.
83) 18) dialog: (covering his anger) I love you too.
83) 19) text: Janine leaves. As soon as she's gone, Ben gets up, shuts the office door - and goes to the closet - when the door FLIES OPEN IN HIS FACE - NEARLY SMASHING HIM.
83) 21) dialog: I had no choice. What was I supposed to do when she -
83) 26) dialog: I didn't want to do it, Anna. You know that it's you I want to be with -
90) 3) text: She walks down halls and up staircases, past end tables and mantles - ALL COVERED WITH PICTURES OF HER AND BEN. Nice and tasteful.
91) 11) text: CUT WIDE TO REVEAL: Ben sitting on a ledge in front of the gym, smoking a cigarette, watching the passersby. He's clearly waiting for Anna to arrive.

107) 4) dialog: Shit...
107) 5) text: - and a NOTE taped onto the carton: BEN - KNOCK YOURSELF OUT. - JANINE P.S. I WANT A DIVORCE. Ben slumps down, devastated.

112) 4) text: He lets her go ahead of him. She smiles, takes him up on it. The cashier rings her up, she pays for her stuff, without giving Ben so much as a look. Ben gives his stuff to the cashier, along with a weak smile.
