12) 1) text: Conor enters his apartment.     ALEX sits on the couch watching TV.
12) 3) dialog: Hey.    How was the date?
12) 10) dialog: My cable's out.
12) 15) dialog: Nope.
12) 19) dialog: How long ago?
12) 27) text: Alex winces.
12) 29) dialog: Sorry, dude.
12) 32) text: Alex shrugs.
12) 36) dialog: At 9:30 PM?    Genius.
12) 40) dialog: Sounds foolproof.
26) 1) text: ALEX sits at a small, cluttered desk, rifling through some papers. Then, from the doorway:
26) 10) text: Alex looks up to see KELLI ANN - Red Maple's hot hostess, standing in the doorway. She makes her way in.
26) 12) dialog: Hey.
26) 16) dialog: I know.    I make the schedule.
26) 20) text: She leans against the desk.     Alex keeps working.
26) 24) dialog: Yeah. It's amazing where 10 shots of Patron will get you.
26) 28) text: Alex stops what he's doing, looks up at her.
26) 30) dialog: Look, Kelli Ann - what happened between us the other night was - fun. But we're way understaffed tonight - I even have to man the bar - and that's why I scheduled you. To work. So...
26) 31) text: He goes back to work. Kelli Ann stands there, frozen. Alex can feel her eyes on him.
26) 33) dialog: Are we good here?
26) 37) text: She leaves.   Alex exhales, goes back to work.
27) 1) text: In the back doorway leading to the alley, Alex stands chatting with TYRONE, 18, a busboy, who smokes a cigarette he holds just outside the doorway.
27) 2) text: Kelli Ann approaches, trying to squeeze through, and ACCIDENTALLY (ON PURPOSE) SHOULDER BLOCKS ALEX. HARD. He has to take a step to catch his balance.
27) 7) dialog: I know.
27) 8) text: Tyrone laughs as Alex shakes his head, not happy.
28) 32) text: Gigi grabs a stool with a good view of the door.     Alex now behind the bar, approaches.
28) 34) dialog: What can I get you?
28) 37) text: Alex takes her in.       She's clearly nervous.
28) 39) dialog: Oh, yeah?    Got a hot date?
28) 43) dialog: Wait - Conor Barry?
28) 48) dialog: Conor's not coming in tonight. Did he forget he was supposed to meet you?
28) 52) dialog: Because I could just call him --
28) 53) text: Alex reaches for the phone.
28) 64) text: Alex waits, looking at Gigi, amused.    She is panicking.
28) 70) text: Alex looks at her skeptically.   And then takes the PEN, and inspects it.
28) 72) dialog: Dr. Frankel - Adult, Child and Geriatric Dentistry.
28) 76) dialog: That's not even his dentist.
28) 80) dialog: My dad.
28) 81) text: Gigi looks at Alex for a long moment, and finally folds.
28) 84) text: Gigi struggles to get out quickly. Alex looks at her - holding her pen, looking quite frazzled - and softens.
28) 94) dialog: Hey. Just - hang out for a second. Lemme buy you a drink.
29) 1) text: It's late. The bar is nearly empty. Alex is totaling receipts - and Gigi is still nursing a drink.
29) 3) dialog: Look, you seem like a cool girl, so I'm just gonna be honest - Conor is never going to call you.
29) 7) dialog: Because I'm a guy.   It's how we do it.
29) 12) dialog: I don't care if he said you were his favorite female since his mommy and Joanie Cunningham. Over a week went by - and he didn't call.
29) 16) dialog: Or maybe he just didn't call because he has no interest in seeing you again.
29) 20) dialog: Your friend Terri's an idiot.   And she's the exception.
29) 32) dialog: You're not. You're the rule. And the rule is - if a guy doesn't call you, he doesn't want to call you.
29) 36) dialog: Yeah. Always. I know what blowing off a woman looks like. I do it early and I do it often. Trust me - if a guy is treating you like he doesn't give a shit - - he doesn't. No exceptions.
29) 40) text: Alex LAUGHS.
29) 42) dialog: I don't know. You looked like you could really use the help.
43) 7) text: Alex sits in his office.    He talks into his CELL.
43) 15) dialog: Gigi?
43) 19) dialog: Right.
43) 23) dialog: Okay, maybe I need to be harsh -- Conor is never going to be interested in you.
43) 27) dialog: Okay...
43) 31) dialog: Lemme guess - he said the only thing happy about this hour is you.
43) 35) dialog: He's not interested.
43) 39) dialog: Did he?
43) 50) dialog: He.   Is.   Not. Interested.
43) 51) text: Tyrone appears in Alex's doorway.
43) 54) text: Tyrone points to a VERY SMALL WHITE INSIGNIA on an otherwise BLACK SHIRT. Alex shuts the door on him.
43) 58) dialog: If a guy gives you his phone number, instead of taking yours, he's not interested.
43) 62) dialog: And, if a guy wants to see you, he will see you. I once called 55 Lauren Bell's until I got the right one.
43) 66) dialog: As it turned out, her ass looked really huge in daylight.
43) 70) dialog: Don't call him. He doesn't like you.
43) 74) dialog: Just trying to help.
46) 1) text: Alex knocks and opens the door in one motion.
46) 3) dialog: Hey dude - you here?
46) 6) text: Alex heads to the fridge, opens it and looks in.
46) 16) dialog: Wanna beer?
46) 19) dialog: Or an apple martini?
46) 24) dialog: Need I ask?
46) 28) dialog: By pretending you're gay?
46) 32) dialog: Or, in real estate terms, by becoming "gay adjacent".
46) 39) dialog: I don't know. You dress like that - and you're already seeing a girl who won't sleep with you - I think maybe you can pull it off.
46) 51) dialog: Won't sleep with you anymore.
46) 55) text: Alex gives him the once over.
46) 57) dialog: I think you're gonna have to beat 'em away with a stick - you hot, sexy man.
48) 4) text: Alex is also mid-makeout on his leather couch with a HOT WOMAN. The PHONE RINGS. Alex grabs it.
48) 6) dialog: Yup.
48) 10) dialog: (to his hot lady) Would you excuse me a second, babe?
48) 11) text: Alex walks into the hallway.
48) 15) dialog: Run.
48) 19) dialog: To where? The Arab Emirates? Where is he going that he has to be out of touch?
48) 36) dialog: Run.
48) 40) dialog: Uhh - yeah.
48) 43) text: Alex LAUGHS.
48) 45) dialog: OK, I don't know why I'm saying this - but I actually think I know a nice guy who you might like.
48) 49) dialog: Yeah. He's a friend of my brother's. Bill. We'll all meet for a drink - it'll be good.
48) 54) dialog: You gotta come out eventually. But I'd really take my time. Let him sweat.
55) 1) text: Gigi sits sipping a drink, alone, when Alex comes in the door and goes directly to her table.
55) 3) dialog: Sorry I'm late.
55) 7) dialog: He's not coming.
55) 8) text: Alex motions to the WAITRESS to bring them another round.
55) 10) dialog: Can't wait to hear that story about the molars, though.
55) 22) dialog: I screwed up. I told Bill it was Thursday, but I meant Tuesday.
55) 28) dialog: Nope.
55) 32) dialog: See the guy trying to work the Tom Cruise thing. She's interested. He's not.
55) 36) dialog: Actually, I can. I manage a restaurant. I see this stuff go down every night. Watch --
55) 37) text: As if on cue, Tom Cruise Guy BANGS his elbow into the GIRL, hard, causing her to spill her drink. Tom Cruise Guy sees, but doesn't acknowledge. Alex looks smug.
55) 41) dialog: And check out droopy dawg on her other side. He can buy her drinks all night, and she'll insist there's no "spark."
55) 45) dialog: The "spark" thing is bullshit.
55) 55) dialog: Guys invented the "spark" so they could not call and treat you kind of bad and keep you guessing, and then convince you that the anxiety and fear that it creates in you is actually a "spark." And you all buy it. You love it. You all thrive on it because you all love drama.
55) 59) dialog: Really? So you don't wait until the last minute on deadlines, or on phone bills, because you love the drama of not knowing whether you'll make it?
55) 64) dialog: And let me guess - when you were stalking Conor that night - were you obsessing about him calling for days, even though the date was just kind of mediocre?
55) 68) dialog: See, you thrive on drama. You gotta be more like me - if a girl likes me great, if not, there are plenty more like her - probably with smaller pores and bigger implants.
55) 72) dialog: Thanks.
55) 83) dialog: I dunno.    I like you.
55) 87) dialog: Don't start doodling my name on your binder. I just mean, I like you, like I like basset hounds. They're kinda pathetic - so you want to cheer them up.
55) 90) text: Alex smiles at her.   Gigi can't help but smile back.
60) 8) dialog: Oh, hey.     You're home.
60) 12) dialog: Out.    It's Saturday night.
60) 16) dialog: I was just calling to let you know - I'm having a party at my place next weekend. You should come.
60) 21) dialog: He's in DC for the weekend at some real estate conference. But there's gonna be a bunch of single guys.
60) 33) dialog: Don't worry. I'll be there.      I'll talk you through it.
60) 37) text: A CRASH outside Alex's office.
60) 39) dialog: Yeah, OK. Gotta go - I think someone just dropped 84 wine glasses.
68) 1) text: The place is packed. Gigi is smashed into a hallway, trying to look relaxed. Alex comes up behind her.
68) 3) dialog: I had no idea it would be such a madhouse.
68) 8) dialog: Are any guys hitting on you? Do you need me to evaluate their level of interest?
68) 12) dialog: Well - too bad Bill couldn't make it. I still think you guys would hit it off.
68) 13) text: Gigi smiles knowingly - on to Alex's scam.
68) 16) text: Alex doesn't know how to take that.
68) 18) dialog: Anyway - I'm on my way to put out some more liquor. But it looks like the food could use some refreshing --
68) 21) dialog: Would you mind helping? I mean, just refill the chips and stuff?
68) 24) text: Gigi LOOKS ELATED.   Alex looks CONFUSED.
68) 33) dialog: Uhh, OK.   The chips are on top of the fridge.
69) 3) text: She CATCHES ALEX'S EYE across the room, he's talking to friends. She smiles and gives a THUMBS UP. He gives an awkward thumbs up back and returns to his conversation.
71) 2) text: Gigi spots Alex in the kitchen and makes a beeline.
71) 5) text: Alex looks at the toaster oven and laughs.
71) 7) dialog: I guess people had fun.
71) 16) text: The tall girl shoots Gigi a dirty look as she grabs a trash bag. Gigi grabs one, too. Alex looks mystified.
71) 18) dialog: Knock yourselves out.
72) 1) text: It is really late. Everyone's gone - except the TALL GIRL and ALEX, who sit on the couch playing a NBA LIVE on the XBOX. Gigi enters from the kitchen.
72) 4) text: The tall girl and Alex do not look up from the game. Gigi stands there awkwardly.
72) 12) text: Alex tosses down his controller.
72) 14) dialog: You are sensational.
72) 18) text: Gigi suppresses a SMILE. The Tall Girl gives Alex a hug, and heads out. Gigi, finally alone with Alex, sits next to him on the couch. They're silent for a moment.
72) 20) dialog: Thanks for staying and helping clean up - but I really gotta get to bed.
72) 24) dialog: What?
72) 33) text: But then -- before Alex knows what's happening, Gigi is LUNGING at him. She puts his face in her hands, and starts to KISS HIM. REALLY KISS HIM. Finally, Gigi pulls away. She looks breathless.
72) 36) text: Alex looks a little afraid.
72) 41) dialog: Wait - what?
72) 45) dialog: Now you and I are in a relationship?
72) 48) text: Alex gets up off the couch.
72) 50) dialog: And why would you think that, exactly?
72) 54) dialog: Really?   Like what?
72) 57) text: She trails off.   Alex is not pleased.
72) 59) dialog: What are you talking about? What have I been saying since I met you? If a guy wants to date you HE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN. HE WILL ASK YOU OUT. DID I ASK YOU OUT?
72) 70) dialog: Why would you do this?
72) 73) text: Alex doesn't even hear her.
72) 75) dialog: Why do women do this? Why do they build this stuff up in their minds, take each little thing a guy does and twist it into something else --
72) 76) text: Gigi stands there, embarrassed, taking Alex's berating.
72) 80) dialog: Excuse me?
82) 1) text: Alex has the staff (of about 10) assembled for the pre- shift meeting. He consults a clipboard as he talks.
82) 3) dialog: OK - Tyrone you bus 4 through 6 - and pitch in with the servers when you -
82) 7) dialog: Right.   Luis you take 4 through 6.
82) 11) text: Alex rifles through his papers, not sure what he's looking for. He slams his clipboard on the bar.
82) 19) dialog: Do we even need to have this meeting? Seriously? Does this serve any purpose?
82) 22) dialog: Good.   Great. Get to work.
82) 23) text: The group disperses, Alex heads around the bar.   He sees Kelli Ann walking away and calls after her.
82) 25) dialog: Hey, Kelli Ann - any calls for me?
82) 28) text: Kelli Ann starts to turn away as she sees Alex grab his cell phone, look at it, then put it down. He grabs a beer, takes a swig - then grabs his cell phone again - staring at it, willing it to ring. He puts it down again. A HUGE SMILE grows on Kelli Ann's face.
82) 32) dialog: What?
82) 36) dialog: What has happened to me?
82) 40) dialog: Who?
82) 44) dialog: There's no girl.
82) 45) text: Alex takes his beer and heads down the bar.
82) 56) dialog: Please -
82) 59) text: Alex stops at the office door.
82) 62) text: Alex looks at Kelli Ann, her words settling in.
82) 64) dialog: Shit.
82) 68) text: Alex takes this in, KNOWING SHE'S RIGHT.
95) 1) text: Alex, in his office, paces as he talks into the phone.
95) 3) dialog: Hey, Gigi. It's Alex. I was just wondering how you were doing. It's been a little while since we've talked -- and I was wondering how you were doing.
95) 10) text: Alex looks up. Tyrone is watching him, shaking his head. Alex motions for Tyrone to leave. He doesn't.
95) 12) dialog: Anyway, I was hoping to talk to you. Obviously. But you're out. So, call me. Sometime. Or tonight. I'm around. OK. That's enough now. It's Alex.
95) 17) dialog: I know.   I know.
100) 1) text: Alex now seems pretty agitated. He's shirtless, his hair's a disaster. He's holding his phone handset. Staring at it. He can't stop himself. He dials.
100) 4) text: Alex hangs up. He stands there for a second, thinking. Then he runs into his bedroom like a madman.
102) 4) text: She opens the DOOR.    It's not Bill.   It's ALEX.
102) 6) dialog: Yeah.   I did.
102) 10) dialog: This.
102) 11) text: Alex reaches into his pocket and pulls out a PEN. THE SAME PEN THAT GIGI PRETENDED TO BE RETURNING TO CONOR. Gigi tries, without success, to suppress a SMILE.
105) 1) text: Gigi and Alex stand in her entry.     She holds the PEN.
105) 10) dialog: I thought I better come up with some excuse to get over here. Isn't that how it's done?
105) 13) text: Alex looks at Gigi for a long moment.    He looks nervous
105) 15) dialog: Look, I can't stop thinking about you. I drive by your place. I call and hang up. I'm turning into -
105) 20) dialog: Yeah.
105) 24) dialog: True.
105) 28) dialog: Here's the thing about that. You were right. I've gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from these women, having the power - that I didn't know what it felt like when I actually - fell - for one of them.
105) 41) dialog: I could do that stuff too.
105) 44) text: But before she can finish her sentence, Alex KISSES HER. A LONG, SLOW, PASSIONATE KISS.
105) 47) text: Alex looks at her.
105) 49) dialog: You are my exception.
111) 1) text: Gigi and Alex sit close on her couch, watching a movie.
111) 4) text: We PAN over to the TV to find that they are watching: SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL. Watts and Keith finally KISS. Gigi can't suppress her smile as Alex pulls her close.
