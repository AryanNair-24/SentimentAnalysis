0) 3) dialog: I have a theory about how this all started...
1) 21) dialog: Uh - excuse me -- but what - the - HELL? Where did that rumor start? Because moms have been spreading it for years.
1) 28) dialog: Do you understand what this means? We are all encouraged to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk -- that means he likes you. Sure, that's a lesson that might serve us as five year olds, but many of us keep believing this advice well into adulthood.
2) 3) dialog: Then, as we get older, we carry on this tradition of misreading the signals men send by encouraging our friends to do the same...
8) 6) dialog: Why do we say this stuff to each other? Why do we tell each other these lies?
8) 13) dialog: Is it possible that it's because we're too scared, and it's too hard, to say the one obvious truth that's staring everyone in the face?
9) 1) text: GIGI, pretty and approachable, sits in a booth at a hip Mt. Vernon date spot with CONOR, cute but holding onto his frat boy roots. They sip their near empty cocktails.
9) 3) dialog: So, Janine told me you're a real estate agent.
9) 7) dialog: So just like on frisbees and notepads?
9) 8) text: Conor laughs.    Gigi smiles -- she's doing well.
9) 12) dialog: Much classier.
9) 15) text: Gigi sips her drink, and looks at Conor.
9) 17) dialog: I wonder why Janine never thought of introducing us before?
9) 23) text: Conor looks to Gigi.
9) 33) dialog: Only if you do. But I mean, if you have to get going I totally ...
9) 34) text: Gigi trails off. Conor considers this for a LONG MOMENT. We can see on Gigi's face that she knows that the outcome of this date hangs in the balance. It's an eternity.
9) 37) text: Gigi breathes a SIGH of relief.
9) 40) text: Gigi NODS and SMILES, clearly flattered that Conor remembered her order. She scoots a little closer to him.
10) 1) text: Gigi and Conor HUG outside the restaurant.
10) 3) dialog: Well, Conor, I had a really nice time.
10) 7) dialog: B-bye.
10) 8) text: Gigi waves flirtatiously and walks away, smiling.
10) 10) text: Gigi TAKES HER CELL OUT OF HER PURSE and dials.
10) 12) dialog: Hey, it's me. He's cute. I think it went well.
10) 15) dialog: And I think he might me leaving me a message at home as - we - speak.
10) 24) text: We FREEZE FRAME ON GIGI, mid-step.    Then, THE IMAGE
17) 1) text: We make our way through rooms with plastic covering the doorways - until we find JANINE stepping into the hallway. She checks herself in a vintage mirror, straightens it a tad, then heads down the stairs to find GIGI, on her cell phone. Gigi slams it closed.
17) 4) text: Gigi shakes her head.
17) 8) dialog: He sells real estate. In Baltimore. Staying in town is his business.
17) 15) dialog: Really?
17) 18) text: Gigi manages a small smile.
17) 20) dialog: This is all your fault.
17) 29) dialog: You set me up with him.
17) 32) text: Gigi peers out the window.
17) 34) dialog: He sold you a house in the ghetto.
17) 37) text: Gigi makes a move for the phone, Janine stops her.
17) 41) dialog: He said he always hangs at Red Maple after work. Maybe I should do a little drive-by?
17) 44) text: Off Gigi - panic seeping in.
18) 1) text: Pilates class. We pan down the row of mats, STUDENTS obediently doing The Mermaid. We finally land on Gigi's mat: Gigi manages to twist herself into a passable Mermaid - as her CELL PHONE lies in full view on her mat.
19) 3) dialog: Mom, I gotta call you back.
20) 1) text: Gigi lays in bed, her CELL PHONE right next to her head. One eye POPS OPEN, checks the phone, and closes again.
21) 2) text: Gigi is in her cubicle. Janine, her friend and, we now learn, co-worker, sits on Gigi's desk.
21) 6) dialog: End.   Why - does it matter?
21) 10) dialog: Maybe it was at the beginning.
21) 19) dialog: Or maybe it was at the end.   Or maybe it was nice to meet me.
21) 21) dialog: Shit.   I can't remember.
21) 27) text: Beth heads to her office.   Janine and Gigi follow.
21) 33) text: Gigi stifles a laugh.
21) 37) dialog: I am so almost done with that. It's just been a little hard to focus on my article about the two sets of twins in market research, when the guy - who may or may not be the guy of my dreams - refuses to call me.
21) 38) text: Beth looks at Gigi, more sympathetic friend than boss.
22) 1) text: Gigi sits at her desk, Janine standing by her side. She's got a few sheets of paper on her desk.
22) 2) text: Gigi takes a deep breath, picks up the office phone and dials. Janine gives her a thumbs up.
22) 4) dialog: It's ringing.
22) 8) dialog: (listening to receiver) Yes!   Voicemail.
22) 11) text: Gigi nods - it's all under control.
22) 13) dialog: (reading off her paper) Hey, Conor. It's Gigi. I just thought, I hadn't heard from you and, I mean how stupid is it that a gal has got to wait for a guy's call anyway, right?
22) 14) text: Gigi laughs, but as she looks back to the notes, she seems confused. She turns to Janine, panicked, mouthing - "What does this say?". Janine looks - she's no help.
22) 16) dialog: (clearly ad-libbing) I mean, we're all equal, right? More than equal -- more women are accepted into law school now than men, and we do better in those police simulations where you can mistakenly shoot innocent people - (rifles through the pages) - I mean I don't know if you saw that Dateline - but women practically have penises now, right? (looks to Janine, helpless) Well, call me. This is Gigi. Call me.
22) 22) text: Gigi hangs up, unsure.   She looks to Janine.
23) 1) text: Gigi stares at the PHONE. Then she feigns disinterest in the phone. It still doesn't ring. Finally, she picks up the receiver to listen for a dial tone. And PANICS.
23) 3) dialog: WHAT?   How can there be no dial tone?
23) 6) dialog: Mom? Is that you? I can't talk now. I'll call you back.
23) 9) dialog: Janine. It's me. Conor never called, so I'm on the precipice of staging a casual run-in at Red Maple. Pick up if you want to stop me. (beat, then really fast) ALRIGHT-I'M-INTERPRETING-YOUR-SILENCE-AS tacit-compliance-bye.
23) 10) text: Gigi hurriedly hangs up, and heads out the door.
28) 1) text: Gigi enters slowly, looking around, searching for Conor.
28) 6) dialog: I'm meeting someone.       A guy.
28) 10) dialog: Hmmmm?
28) 13) text: Gigi continues to scan the place, not paying attention.
28) 15) dialog: I'm meeting someone.
28) 18) text: Gigi finishes her visual tour of the room - no Conor.
28) 26) dialog: I'm gonna wait at the bar.
28) 29) text: Gigi walks off.    Kelli Ann takes her place behind the hostess stand.
28) 32) text: Gigi grabs a stool with a good view of the door.     Alex now behind the bar, approaches.
28) 36) dialog: Oh, that's OK. I'm meeting someone.
28) 41) dialog: I don't know if you'd call it hot -- I mean this guy Conor and I have only been out the one time so --
28) 44) text: Gigi is busted.
28) 46) dialog: Oh, uhh, yeah --
28) 50) dialog: See when I said "meeting someone" I guess that was kind of a broad term, kind of a wide interpretation of the word "meeting"-
28) 63) dialog: NO! I mean, totally unnecessary. I mean, I actually was just - in the area - so I figured I'd just swing by and see if he was around - because - uhhh ---
28) 64) text: Alex waits, looking at Gigi, amused.    She is panicking.
28) 66) dialog: I uhh, had to return his --
28) 67) text: Gigi frantically searches her coat pockets - searching for something, anything - and finally fishes out A PEN. She looks at it - and decides to go with it.
28) 69) dialog: Pen. I had to return this - pen. He left this. So, I thought I should really return it before he - you know - (conspiratorially to Alex) -- freaks out.
28) 74) dialog: Look, I'm not gonna judge about what may or may not be important to someone.
28) 78) dialog: Oh, really?   Then who's his dentist?
28) 81) text: Gigi looks at Alex for a long moment, and finally folds.
28) 83) dialog: I'm Gigi. Conor and I went out last week. And I just...I thought if I ran into him...I don't know. I'm gonna go.
28) 84) text: Gigi struggles to get out quickly. Alex looks at her - holding her pen, looking quite frazzled - and softens.
28) 95) text: Gigi SMILES and sits back down.
29) 1) text: It's late. The bar is nearly empty. Alex is totaling receipts - and Gigi is still nursing a drink.
29) 5) dialog: Oh really? How do you know?
29) 9) dialog: 
29) 14) dialog: But maybe he called me and I didn't get the message. Or maybe he lost my number, or was out of town, or was hit by a cab, or his grandma died.
29) 18) dialog: Yeah but my friend Terri once went out with this guy who never called and she totally wrote him off - then like a year later she ran into him --
29) 30) dialog: OK.   But what if I'm the exception?
29) 34) dialog: Really?     Always?
29) 37) text: Gigi thinks this over.
29) 39) dialog: Why are you telling me all of this? Aren't these man-secrets - like why men need to watch televised golf?
29) 44) dialog: Thank you. You've given me a lot to think about.
29) 45) text: Gigi smiles at him.
30) 1) text: Gigi comes in - carrying a MESSY HANDFUL OF PAPERS, with crazy hair and wearing the last outfit we saw her in.
30) 5) dialog: I was up all night.
30) 17) dialog: Sure. It's basically done.   But this is important.
30) 20) text: Beth comes out of her office and looks at Gigi.
31) 1) text: Gigi paces in front of Beth's desk.
31) 3) dialog: I think I figured it out. Remember when I went out with that notary public? And he cheated on me? And then Anastasia from upstairs told us that story about how her boyfriend cheated on her at the beginning - but then he totally changed and they're married and crazy in love.
31) 7) dialog: No, notary. Anyway, the point is - Anastasia is the exception. Not the rule. We have to stop listening to these stories - because the rule is that most guys who cheat on you up front don't really care about you very much.
31) 10) text: Gigi consults her crumpled pieces of paper.
31) 12) dialog: Exhibit A: Chad, the drummer who lived in his storage space. He only used me for rides, yet I continued to stalk him for most of 1998. Then there was Don, who broke up with me every Friday so he could have his weekends free. I was so delusional about our relationship that I referred to him as my husband to random people like my dental hygenist.
31) 18) dialog: And all my friends would tell me stories about how things might work out with these dipshits because they knew someone who knew someone who dated a dipshit just like mine, and that girl ended up getting married and living happily ever after. But that's the exception. And we're not the exception - we're the rule.
31) 19) text: Gigi sits down, spent.   But Beth has been listening.
31) 22) text: Beth is serious.   Gigi freezes, tries to backtrack.
31) 24) dialog: No. No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. This has absolutely nothing to do with you. I was just talking, you know, about me. Specifically.
36) 12) text: Ben hangs up. And STARES INTO SPACE until THE DOOR OPENS TO REVEAL: JANINE. Gigi's co-worker. And Ben's WIFE.
37) 1) text: Packed, Federal Hill happy hour bar scene. Gigi and Janine stand, squeezed in among the after work crowd.
37) 2) text: JARRAD, early thirties, chats amiably with Gigi.
37) 6) dialog: You go back to the office after happy hour? What's happy about that?
37) 15) text: Janine and Gigi melt.
37) 19) dialog: Of course.
37) 20) text: Gigi hands him her card with lightning speed.
37) 23) text: Jarrad hands Gigi HIS CARD as well.
37) 26) text: He starts to head over to his BUDDIES.   Gigi is confused
37) 28) dialog: So, wait -- how are we doing this? Are you hearing from me or am I getting a call?
37) 33) dialog: You said you'd love to call me, but then you said "look forward to hearing from you." See how that's kinda confusing?
37) 38) dialog: Ooopsie - you did it again. Very vague. You know what? Why don't we just say that you'll call me, and then we can skip all the nonsense.
37) 48) dialog: Or I guess I could just call you --
37) 53) dialog: He was cute.
37) 56) text: Gigi looks at the name on the card - JARRAD MONTROSE - and then - TEARS HIS BUSINESS CARD IN TWO.
37) 60) dialog: I'm not calling him.    If he wants to see me - he'll call.
37) 64) dialog: No.   He was just -- right.
37) 65) text: Off Gigi, sipping her drink, full of optimism.
43) 1) text: CLOSE ON: A TORN BUSINESS CARD, TAPED BACK TOGETHER. The name on the card is JARRAD MONTROSE. Gigi sits, staring at the card. She reaches for the phone, and then thinks the better of it. And again.
43) 4) dialog: Hi, this is Gigi.
43) 17) dialog: Gigi Phillips. I had the - umm - dentist pen.
43) 21) dialog: I'm really sorry to bug you. I just - I thought you had some really good insights the other night and -- I had a question.
43) 25) dialog: No, I know. This is about - (she looks at the card) - Jarrad. You have a sec?
43) 29) dialog: So I meet him at happy hour and he was completely charming --
43) 33) dialog: He may have used some derivative of that. So, he says he's going to call, but then gave me his card and --
43) 37) dialog: You don't even know if he called --
43) 41) dialog: No. But the thing is, I honestly think he's expecting my call.
43) 48) dialog: He said "Look forward to hearing from you" and not "Look forward to talking to you." I mean, do you hear the connotations?
43) 60) dialog: He took mine first, but then he --
43) 64) dialog: That's cute.    What happened?
43) 68) dialog: Is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women?
43) 72) dialog: Again with the sensitivity.
43) 83) dialog: I know.   Thanks.
43) 84) text: Gigi hangs up, re-tears up Jarrad's card.
47) 1) text: Leather couch, framed Orioles jersey - typical bachelor pad. Gigi is making out with GREGORY, 30s.
47) 3) dialog: Who would have thought that a random girl from Pilates would fix me up with such a good kisser?
47) 6) text: Gigi beams.   They make out some more.
47) 8) dialog: I can't wait to kiss you again.
47) 12) dialog: I know. But next time. The second date kiss is way more intimate.
47) 16) text: Gregory starts pulling off Gigi's top.    Gigi pulls away deftly.
47) 23) dialog: Would you excuse me a quick second?    Too many diet cokes...
47) 24) text: Gigi makes a beeline down the hall.
48) 1) text: Gigi dials her CELL as she goes through Gregory's bathroom cabinets.
48) 8) dialog: Hey, sorry to bug you again.   Quick question.
48) 13) dialog: I'm making out with a guy - PG stuff - and then he mentions he's going out of town, so he's gonna be out of touch.
48) 17) dialog: But maybe he is going out of town.
48) 20) text: Gigi opens the bathroom door and SHOUTS down the hall.
48) 22) dialog: Where are you going out of town to again?
48) 34) dialog: Pittsburgh.
48) 38) dialog: So, now what? I'm just supposed to run from every guy who doesn't like me?
48) 42) dialog: There's not going to be anyone left.
48) 47) dialog: Yeah?
48) 50) text: Gigi smiles.
48) 52) dialog: So, I'm in his bathroom right now.   What do I now?
48) 55) text: He hangs up. Gigi finds some Crest Whitestrips and - with determination - decides to APPLY THEM.
55) 1) text: Gigi sits sipping a drink, alone, when Alex comes in the door and goes directly to her table.
55) 5) dialog: That's OK. I like a little time before a blind date - prepare myself mentally, remind myself not to tell the story about my molars --
55) 12) dialog: How can he already not like me?
55) 23) text: Gigi is disappointed. The waitress drops off their drinks. They toast - then observe the SCENE AT THE BAR.
55) 25) dialog: Awesome. I'm stuck here with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday - and meanwhile this girl - (motions to GIRL at the bar) - she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak.
55) 30) dialog: How do you know?
55) 34) dialog: You cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not interested.
55) 39) dialog: Man, you have a gift.
55) 43) dialog: Maybe there isn't.   You need a spark.
55) 53) dialog: Really?    Enlighten me.
55) 57) dialog: I don't.
55) 62) dialog: Maybe.
55) 66) dialog: OK.   Yeah.
55) 70) dialog: That's beautiful.
55) 75) dialog: Why are you sharing all this inside dating information with me again?
55) 85) dialog: You do?
55) 89) dialog: Again with the sensitivity.
55) 90) text: Alex smiles at her.   Gigi can't help but smile back.
60) 1) text: Gigi sits on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, eating graham crackers and watching SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL on TV. The phone RINGS.
60) 3) dialog: Hello.
60) 10) dialog: Where am I supposed to be?
60) 14) dialog: You won't let me go out with guys who don't like me. It's kind of limiting.
60) 17) text: Gigi considers this.
60) 19) dialog: I don't know. Won't Conor be there? Might be kinda awkward.
60) 31) dialog: So I will have plenty of chances to be awkward. Thank god.
60) 34) text: Gigi smiles.
60) 36) dialog: So, the party - is it like a big party, more of a mellow hang or --
60) 40) text: Gigi hangs up, and goes back to watching her movie.
60) 52) text: Gigi sits up. A light bulb has gone off. As she watches Keith and Watts kiss on screen, a smile crosses her face.
61) 1) text: Gigi blows in, dumps her things and turns to Janine:
61) 11) dialog: He's into me.
61) 15) dialog: Alex. It's totally clear to me now. He's Watts.
61) 19) dialog: From Some Kind of Wonderful.
61) 23) dialog: Yes.
61) 27) dialog: I'm Eric Stoltz.
61) 31) dialog: Alex is Watts because Watts helps Eric Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones, but really she's in love with Eric Stoltz herself.
61) 35) dialog: I guess Conor at first. Now men in general. But that's not the point.    The point is -- he's into me.
61) 47) dialog: I know! It's so obvious now -- there are so many signs.
61) 50) text: Janine rolls her chair closer to Gigi's desk.
61) 52) dialog: At first they were small - like when I first called he said "Good to hear from you" -
61) 55) dialog: Right? And then the next time I called he was with a woman - but he still took the call. And talked to me for a while.
61) 59) dialog: He called her "babe."
61) 63) dialog: I know! And it gets more obvious. I mean, please - there was no guy he was going to fix me up with. The fix up was him.
61) 67) dialog: He shows up - without this fictitious Bill character - and the two of us basically have a date. And then he calls me to invite me to a party at his place.
61) 70) text: Janine rolls her chair up to Gigi's computer screen.
61) 78) text: Gigi laughs but doesn't fight as Janine starts searching.
66) 2) text: Gigi stands, somewhat uncomfortably, near the Chex Mix. She tries smiling at a TALL GIRL, who ignores her. So Gigi continues absently and compulsively shoving handfuls of Chex Mix into her mouth.
66) 6) dialog: Pardon?
66) 7) text: Gigi looks up to see Nathan and Bruce - Mary's gay coworkers who are now decked out in full-on Saturday night gay mode - standing next to her.
66) 10) text: Gigi puts her handful of Chex Mix back.
66) 12) dialog: Thanks for the tip.
66) 23) text: Gigi LAUGHS.
66) 25) dialog: Thanks.   I'm good.
66) 30) dialog: Gigi.   How do you guys know Alex?
66) 33) text: Gigi smiles in recognition.
66) 37) dialog: I hope - I mean I'm pretty sure - something is about to happen between us.
66) 42) text: Suddenly, a look of DOUBT sweeps across Gigi's face.
66) 44) dialog: He didn't really say.
66) 47) dialog: But I'm sure I'm more than just a guest. I mean - there have been signs.
66) 59) text: He reaches in his pocket.    Gigi looks at him gratefully
66) 61) dialog: Thank you.
68) 1) text: The place is packed. Gigi is smashed into a hallway, trying to look relaxed. Alex comes up behind her.
68) 4) text: Gigi turns to him and smiles.
68) 6) dialog: Hey.   Great party.
68) 10) dialog: They were gay. Even I know that their level of interest was probably low.
68) 13) text: Gigi smiles knowingly - on to Alex's scam.
68) 15) dialog: Oh OK.  Right. (air quotes) "Bill".
68) 23) dialog: You mean, kind of like --- co-hosting?
68) 24) text: Gigi LOOKS ELATED.   Alex looks CONFUSED.
68) 34) text: He walks away.   Gigi smiles BIG.
69) 1) text: The party is now even more crowded. Gigi weaves her way through the crowd. She's deftly holding SIX DRINKS, passing them off to various people as she walks.
70) 1) text: Gigi is in the kitchen, mixing up some DIP. She chats with a couple of PARTY-GOERS, very much at home.
70) 5) dialog: Thanks. When Alex said he wanted to have a party, I was like "Let's do it."
70) 9) dialog: No problem.   Anytime.
70) 10) text: An attractive TALL GIRL enters the kitchen, and starts LOOKING IN THE CUPBOARDS. Gigi watches with interest.
70) 12) dialog: Can I help you find something?
70) 16) text: She brings the bowl over to the counter, and starts emptying Gigi's dip into the bowl. Gigi is THROWN.
70) 26) dialog: What?
70) 29) text: Gigi's face grows red.   The Tall Girl tastes the dip.
70) 32) text: Then the Tall Girl deftly grabs the dip, and chips, and heads back out to the party. Gigi looks to the confused party-goers, not pleased.
71) 1) text: Bruce and Nathan wave to Gigi as they leave. People are getting coats - the crowd is definitely thinning.
71) 2) text: Gigi spots Alex in the kitchen and makes a beeline.
71) 4) dialog: When someone's underwear ends up in your toaster oven - it's been a good party.
71) 11) text: Gigi STARES DAGGERS AT HER.
71) 13) dialog: That's sweet of you. But I thought I'd stick around, so I'll take care of it.
71) 16) text: The tall girl shoots Gigi a dirty look as she grabs a trash bag. Gigi grabs one, too. Alex looks mystified.
72) 1) text: It is really late. Everyone's gone - except the TALL GIRL and ALEX, who sit on the couch playing a NBA LIVE on the XBOX. Gigi enters from the kitchen.
72) 3) dialog: I think I've rounded up the last of the beer bottles.
72) 4) text: The tall girl and Alex do not look up from the game. Gigi stands there awkwardly.
72) 6) dialog: So, umm - what game is this?
72) 9) dialog: Well, maybe I should just -- you know -- I mean it's past three and --
72) 15) text: The tall girl beams.   Gigi flinches.
72) 18) text: Gigi suppresses a SMILE. The Tall Girl gives Alex a hug, and heads out. Gigi, finally alone with Alex, sits next to him on the couch. They're silent for a moment.
72) 22) dialog: Is that an invitation?
72) 26) dialog: I'm sorry. That was cheesy.      I'm not good at this.
72) 33) text: But then -- before Alex knows what's happening, Gigi is LUNGING at him. She puts his face in her hands, and starts to KISS HIM. REALLY KISS HIM. Finally, Gigi pulls away. She looks breathless.
72) 35) dialog: Yes!
72) 38) dialog: I knew it. I knew it. The best relationships grow out of friendships.
72) 43) dialog: Ummmm....
72) 47) dialog: Well, I'd say if we're not at relationship station--ship, we're at least on the track.
72) 52) dialog: Because there were - you know - signs.
72) 56) dialog: Ummm - it was good to hear from me. You talked to me even when you were with a girl. I felt something...
72) 67) dialog: 
72) 72) dialog: I thought you were Watts.
72) 76) text: Gigi stands there, embarrassed, taking Alex's berating.
72) 78) dialog: I'd rather be like that - than like you.
72) 82) dialog: Maybe I dissect each little thing, and put myself out there too much, and maybe I even thrive on the drama of it all-- but at least that means I still care. You think you've won because women are expendable to you? Sure, you don't get hurt or make an ass of yourself that way, but you don't fall in love that way, either. You haven't won, Alex.
