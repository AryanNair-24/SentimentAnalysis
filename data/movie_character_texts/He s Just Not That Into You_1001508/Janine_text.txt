17) 1) text: We make our way through rooms with plastic covering the doorways - until we find JANINE stepping into the hallway. She checks herself in a vintage mirror, straightens it a tad, then heads down the stairs to find GIGI, on her cell phone. Gigi slams it closed.
17) 3) dialog: OK, so clearly he hasn't called.
17) 6) dialog: Maybe he's away on business.
17) 10) dialog: Right.
17) 11) text: Janine ponders this.
17) 13) dialog: Look, let me tell you - after the first time I went out with Ben, he didn't call me for eleven days. ELEVEN DAYS. And now he's like the world's best husband. That happens all the time.
17) 17) dialog: Yes, really.
17) 22) dialog: What?    Why?
17) 31) dialog: No - you asked if I knew any guys and I gave Conor your number. That's not a set up. When I do a set up - I weigh pros and cons. I do my due diligence. All I know about Conor is he sold us this house.
17) 36) dialog: It's a neighborhood "in transition."
17) 37) text: Gigi makes a move for the phone, Janine stops her.
17) 39) dialog: Seriously, stop.
17) 43) dialog: Please, don't. He'll call.
21) 2) text: Gigi is in her cubicle. Janine, her friend and, we now learn, co-worker, sits on Gigi's desk.
21) 4) dialog: So, this was at the end of the date, or at the beginning?
21) 8) dialog: Yeah. "Nice meeting you" at the beginning of the date is normal. "Nice meeting you" at the end could be a blow off.
21) 12) dialog: Then that's fine. He's gonna call.
21) 20) dialog: Wait - was it "nice meeting you" or "nice to meet you"?
21) 23) dialog: "Nice to meet you" is OK. "Nice meeting you" is like "Do you want your receipt in the bag?"
21) 27) text: Beth heads to her office.   Janine and Gigi follow.
21) 30) text: Janine, clearly organized, flips open her notebook:
21) 32) dialog: Beckon the baking to begin! McCormick, the flavor expert, introduces five fun filled flavors that will definitely delight dessert divas!
22) 1) text: Gigi sits at her desk, Janine standing by her side. She's got a few sheets of paper on her desk.
22) 2) text: Gigi takes a deep breath, picks up the office phone and dials. Janine gives her a thumbs up.
22) 6) dialog: Pretty standard.
22) 10) dialog: Your notes.
22) 14) text: Gigi laughs, but as she looks back to the notes, she seems confused. She turns to Janine, panicked, mouthing - "What does this say?". Janine looks - she's no help.
22) 22) text: Gigi hangs up, unsure.   She looks to Janine.
22) 24) dialog: Don't worry.    He's totally gonna call.
30) 3) dialog: Everything OK?
30) 7) dialog: Please say you were working on the newsletter.
30) 19) dialog: What's happening with your hair?
36) 12) text: Ben hangs up. And STARES INTO SPACE until THE DOOR OPENS TO REVEAL: JANINE. Gigi's co-worker. And Ben's WIFE.
36) 14) dialog: Hey, how --
36) 18) text: Janine looks at him.
36) 20) dialog: Is everything OK?
36) 25) dialog: Are you smoking again?
36) 29) dialog: Well - you get jumpy when you smoke.
36) 30) text: Ben puts his arm around Janine, and pulls her close.
36) 33) text: Janine contentedly curls up to Ben.
36) 35) dialog: I don't know - I was thinking maybe - pink?
36) 45) dialog: Well, I mean, at some point.
36) 46) text: Janine gives Ben a knowing look.   He gets it.
36) 50) dialog: No. But I mean, we could paint one room pink and one blue just in case.
36) 55) dialog: I'm sorry. I know I promised we'd wait to talk about it -
36) 59) text: Janine smiles CONTENTEDLY.
36) 61) dialog: I've always liked the name Gisele.
37) 1) text: Packed, Federal Hill happy hour bar scene. Gigi and Janine stand, squeezed in among the after work crowd.
37) 15) text: Janine and Gigi melt.
37) 55) dialog: Please don't cyber-stalk him.
37) 58) dialog: Wait - what are you doing?
37) 62) dialog: Wow, that guy Alex really made an impression on you. Was he hot?
41) 1) text: Janine walks in from work to her construction site home. She peeks into the dining room, where she sees her CHERRY WOOD DINING TABLE covered in a THICK LAYER OF DUST.
41) 3) dialog: JAVIER!
41) 6) dialog: JAVIER. I THOUGHT WE TALKED ABOUT TARPING THE FURNITURE.
41) 7) text: Still nothing. So Janine drops her work things, and heads out the side door of the house to a STORAGE AREA.
42) 1) text: There are cans of paint, bags of cement, some tarps. Janine grabs a TARP, when she sees, on a window ledge, next to a folding chair - AN ALUMINUM FOIL ASHTRAY. CIGARETTE BUTTS. AN EMPTY PACK OF AMERICAN SPIRITS.
51) 1) text: Ben comes in the front door, drops his gym bag. Janine sits on the couch flipping through a magazine. He leans in to kiss her on the cheek. She does not look happy.
51) 3) dialog: Honey - you smell different.
51) 8) dialog: I don't know.
51) 18) dialog: Maybe it's the ashtray and cigarettes I found. In the side yard. What part of "my dad died of lung cancer" is hard for you to wrap your brain around?
51) 22) dialog: Do not lie to me, Ben.      Please.
51) 26) dialog: Well, yes.
51) 29) text: Ben walks away.    Off Janine, wanting to believe him.
56) 1) text: Janine walks down the hallway, with JAVIER (40, stocky), her contractor. She's inspecting the crown molding.
56) 3) dialog: It looks good.
56) 7) dialog: He does good work.
56) 10) text: Janine stops and looks at Javier.   He looks back at her.
56) 12) dialog: Javier.
56) 16) dialog: Javier, if I asked you an honest question, do you think you could give me an honest answer?
56) 20) dialog: Good. Because I think some of your guys have been - smoking.
56) 27) text: Janine looks at Javier.    It's awkwardly silent.
56) 29) dialog: Javier?
56) 33) dialog: Yes.
56) 37) dialog: The question part was implied -
56) 41) dialog: Javier - have your guys been smoking or not?
56) 45) dialog: Are you sure your guys aren't sneaking around here? And smoking? And lying to me? And -- smoking?
56) 50) dialog: I need you to be honest with me, Javier. Because I can't have someone lying to me. To my face. Under my roof. On my time.
56) 53) text: Janine does not hear him, and barrels on -
56) 55) dialog: I mean, there is no reason for that kind of dishonesty, is there? IS THERE? I mean, we made promises to one another --
56) 63) dialog: What I mean is, we had a contract. Which is like making promises to each other, right?
56) 67) dialog: Yes.   Fine.    Good idea.
56) 70) dialog: But, we're good here, right?     Me and you?
56) 71) text: Blank stare from Javier.    Janine slaps on a smile.
56) 73) dialog: Okay, great.     The molding really does look great.
61) 1) text: Gigi blows in, dumps her things and turns to Janine:
61) 13) dialog: Awesome. I knew it. (she hugs Gigi) Who's this now?
61) 17) dialog: What?
61) 21) dialog: Wait, isn't Mary Stuart Masterson Watts?
61) 25) dialog: So, why aren't you Watts?
61) 29) dialog: What?
61) 33) dialog: Wait - so who's Amanda Jones?
61) 37) dialog: You know, I knew there had to be a reason he was spending all that time with you.
61) 49) dialog: Oooh, gimme the signs.   I love to hear about the signs.
61) 50) text: Janine rolls her chair closer to Gigi's desk.
61) 54) dialog: Totally good sign.
61) 57) dialog: You know it was a woman?
61) 61) dialog: A guy does not leave a woman - to talk to another woman - unless there's something going on.
61) 65) dialog: Wait - really?
61) 69) dialog: You're right. He so likes you.
61) 70) text: Janine rolls her chair up to Gigi's computer screen.
61) 77) dialog: Let's look up places for your destination wedding. Would you guys wanna do Napa Valley - I've always wanted to go there.
61) 78) text: Gigi laughs but doesn't fight as Janine starts searching.
63) 1) text: CLOSE ON: TWO SEEMINGLY IDENTICAL PLANKS OF WOOD. We pull back to reveal Ben and Janine, in the wide aisle of Home Depot, as Janine really studies the two pieces of wood. Finally, she POINTS to one of them.
63) 3) dialog: That one.
63) 7) dialog: That one isn't real hardwood floor?
63) 10) text: Janine considers this.
63) 19) dialog: I still wanna go with the real wood.
63) 23) dialog: That's not the point.
63) 27) dialog: I just don't like the way it's pretending to be wood. If you're not wood, then don't try to look like wood.
63) 30) text: Ben is making light.   But Janine is all business.
63) 32) dialog: It's a lie. Just be up front - tell people what you really are.
63) 37) dialog: It's OK. Maybe we should look at the grills and come back.
63) 41) text: Janine stops, doesn't say anything.
63) 45) dialog: I heard you.
63) 56) dialog: You tell me this in Home Depot because you know how I hate a public scene.
63) 60) dialog: I knew it.     I KNEW IT.   You asshole.
63) 64) dialog: And it's you that's been smoking, too, isn't it?
63) 67) text: Janine turns to Ben.    She is IRATE.
63) 69) dialog: HAVE - YOU - BEEN - SMOKING?
63) 72) text: Janine just STARES AT HIM, FUMING.
63) 75) text: Now Janine's eyes go wide with disbelief.
63) 77) dialog: EXCUSE ME? And now you want to move out? You're like - what - leaving me?
63) 82) dialog: We're not going to deal with this? We're not going to figure out a way to work through this?
63) 94) dialog: Is that what you want?
63) 98) dialog: OK.
78) 1) text: Janine sits at Beth's desk, across from Gigi, who stares at her in disbelief. Janine fiddles with a TILE SAMPLE.
78) 5) dialog: (shaking her head "no") It doesn't matter.
78) 9) dialog: Gigi, he's my husband. He's not just some guy that didn't call me back. And he did admit it to me. He didn't wait to get caught. That takes courage.
78) 18) dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.     I know Alex was not just some guy.
78) 22) dialog: It's my fault, you know.
78) 26) dialog: I'm willing to accept my responsibility in this. I forced him into getting married. He wasn't ready.
78) 30) dialog: It is.  I've - changed. I used to be fun. I was fun when we met.
78) 33) text: A BEAT.   Janine looks at Gigi, the tears come.
78) 35) dialog: We never have sex anymore.
78) 39) dialog: No. We never have sex. Realistically, what did I expect him to do?
78) 44) dialog: This is too small. I gotta tell Javier.
78) 55) dialog: This tile. I gotta go.    Tell Beth I took a personal day.
78) 56) text: Janine grabs her purse, heads out as Gigi looks on.
80) 21) dialog: It's not Dana.
80) 38) dialog: Why do you even lock it?
80) 42) text: Finally, Ben opens the door, and Janine is standing there, smiling.
80) 44) dialog: Can I come in?
80) 51) dialog: Sit down.
80) 55) text: Janine, clearly a little nervous, goes to straddle Ben at his desk chair. Her skirt is way too long to do this, so she has to regroup, and hike up the skirt. Ben glances over at the closet.
80) 59) dialog: I don't know. I just thought - maybe we could, you know, relight the fire.
80) 67) text: Ben picks up some papers, but Janine is not giving up.
80) 69) dialog: Look, I am trying here. Do you want to save our marriage or don't you?
80) 70) text: Janine looks at Ben.   Ben is SILENT.
81) 5) dialog: Then you'll let me do this.
81) 8) dialog: Yeah, just like that, yeah...
83) 1) text: Janine, now fully dressed, hovers by the door.       Ben back at his desk, eyes on his computer.
83) 3) dialog: You sure I can't interest you in a little beef and broccoli? I'm treating.
83) 6) text: Janine is clearly flailing.      She starts to go.
83) 8) dialog: OK.   I'll see you at home.     I love you.
83) 19) text: Janine leaves. As soon as she's gone, Ben gets up, shuts the office door - and goes to the closet - when the door FLIES OPEN IN HIS FACE - NEARLY SMASHING HIM.
89) 1) text: Janine pulls up in her Land Rover and gets out. As she approaches the house, she stops in her tracks. ALL THE SCAFFOLDING IS GONE. THE HOUSE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. She whips out her cell phone and dials.
89) 3) dialog: Javier - does this mean what I think it means? So when you say "done" - you don't mean "we still need plumbing in the upstairs bathrooms done" - you mean "done done"?...Wow - you're amazing...OK...I'll call when I see it...Bye.
90) 1) text: As Janine enters - she can't believe her eyes.
90) 2) text: VARIOUS SHOTS as Janine walks from room to room - amazed. Where there once were plastic sheets there are now walls with vintage wall paper. All the floors are immaculate, the chandeliers sparkle - it's all perfect.
91) 12) text: His PHONE RINGS. He looks at it - JANINE CALLING. He IGNORES the call, takes another drag of his cigarette.
92) 1) text: With Janine as the call goes to voice mail. She hangs up, confused. She sits on the edge of the bed, looking around the room, not sure what to do with herself.
92) 5) dialog: YOU LYING SACK OF SHIT!
107) 1) text: Ben walks into the house and looks around - no Janine.
107) 5) text: - and a NOTE taped onto the carton: BEN - KNOCK YOURSELF OUT. - JANINE P.S. I WANT A DIVORCE. Ben slumps down, devastated.
113) 2) text: Janine enters, carrying two boxes. She opens one, and pulls out the ANTIQUE MIRROR (now with new glass).
