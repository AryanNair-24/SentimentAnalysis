9) 1) text: GIGI, pretty and approachable, sits in a booth at a hip Mt. Vernon date spot with CONOR, cute but holding onto his frat boy roots. They sip their near empty cocktails.
9) 5) dialog: Yeah. But don't worry - not one of the cheesy ones who puts his headshot on bus benches and grocery carts.
9) 8) text: Conor laughs.    Gigi smiles -- she's doing well.
9) 10) dialog: You got it.
9) 14) dialog: My thoughts exactly.
9) 15) text: Gigi sips her drink, and looks at Conor.
9) 19) dialog: Yeah, I don't know, I ummm -
9) 23) text: Conor looks to Gigi.
9) 31) dialog: You want one more?
9) 34) text: Gigi trails off. Conor considers this for a LONG MOMENT. We can see on Gigi's face that she knows that the outcome of this date hangs in the balance. It's an eternity.
9) 36) dialog: Umm.    OK.   Sure. One more.
9) 39) dialog: You had Ketel and soda, right?
9) 40) text: Gigi NODS and SMILES, clearly flattered that Conor remembered her order. She scoots a little closer to him.

10) 5) dialog: Yeah.    It was really nice meeting you.
10) 9) text: She turns around to look, and sees Conor TAKE HIS CELL PHONE OUT OF HIS POCKET.
10) 13) text: She sneaks another look over her shoulder to see Conor.
10) 26) text: CONOR - also in FREEZE FRAME. The image UNFREEZES and we continue with Conor as he DIALS HIS CELL PHONE.
10) 28) dialog: Hey, it's me...I just wanted you to know that I was thinking about you.
12) 1) text: Conor enters his apartment.     ALEX sits on the couch watching TV.
12) 5) dialog: Fine.   You know.
12) 6) text: Conor heads for the kitchen, and turns back.
12) 8) dialog: Why are you here?
12) 11) text: Conor returns from the kitchen with a beer.
12) 13) dialog: You didn't hear the phone ring, did you?
12) 17) dialog: Shit. Anna gave me the "I'll call you right back."
12) 26) dialog: 22 minutes.
12) 31) dialog: Do I call back?
12) 34) dialog: I know. I'll call back and say that I'm going to bed.
12) 38) dialog: It is genius. Because then I can say: "In case you were going to call me back - don't - 'cause I'll be sleeping."
12) 41) text: Conor pulls off his jacket and tosses it next to a box - which contains about 50 FRISBEES. On each frisbee:
12) 45) text: Conor dials his cell phone as he heads back to his room.
28) 1) text: Gigi enters slowly, looking around, searching for Conor.
28) 18) text: Gigi finishes her visual tour of the room - no Conor.
33) 1) text: Conor opens the door to find Anna standing there.
33) 3) dialog: I am so psyched that you called.
33) 13) dialog: I had sort of given up on you when you didn't call me back the other night.
33) 16) text: Conor buys it, and ushers her inside.
34) 1) text: Anna is stretched out with a wine glass in hand, feet in Conor's lap. He rubs her feet as they talk.
34) 5) dialog: OK.   Give me the categories again.
34) 9) dialog: I love that you are hot for Clinton.
34) 13) dialog: What was I again?
34) 16) text: Conor smiles, happy for any compliment.
34) 18) dialog: OK.   You're sexy. Very sexy.    And cute.
34) 29) dialog: Well, I sound like a jackass if I say you're all four. But you're so obviously all four. Especially sexy.
34) 32) text: Anna sits up, and moves to Conor. She looks at him, pulls him in for a nice, long HUG.
34) 36) dialog: Oh. OK. I mean, you could just stay here tonight.
34) 39) dialog: What?   It's been a while.
34) 43) dialog: Sure.   Of course.
34) 44) text: Anna smiles and gets up. Conor reluctantly follows her to the door. She KISSES HIM ON THE LIPS, smiles, and leaves.
38) 42) text: Conor sits on a bench, NEWSPAPER folded open on his lap.
38) 51) dialog: Hey, it's Conor. Anna's - uh - friend. Or whatever.
38) 55) dialog: I'm not sure about this.
38) 58) text: Conor looks at the paper.
38) 60) dialog: Yeah. I hope so. But, like - did you have to put me on the page with the massage ads?
38) 64) dialog: OK. You're right.      Hey, have you talked to Anna lately?
38) 65) text: Conor leaves the paper and gets up. He walks away, still on the phone, we STAY WITH THE NEWSPAPER AND WE PUSH IN.
44) 2) text: As the candles are blown out, we widen to reveal: Anna and Conor siting at a cheap picnic table in a tiny backyard, across from MAYA - Anna's mom.
44) 14) dialog: What is it?
44) 17) dialog: Tim Buckley.    Nice.
44) 24) dialog: No.   She did not.
44) 42) dialog: Umm - I don't think so -
44) 48) text: Anna goes inside.   Maya looks to Conor, takes a sip.
44) 51) text: She leans back, puts out her cigarette as Anna returns with A PICTURE. She hands it to Conor.
44) 60) dialog: Wow.   That's - unbelievable.
44) 63) text: Conor looks down at the picture, then back up to Anna.
44) 65) dialog: That's funny, because, I mean, I guess I kinda did. Anna and I met at a restaurant. That serves coffee. So, not a coffee shop, but...still -
44) 72) text: Anna looks to Conor apologetically.    He just smiles.
45) 1) text: Anna and Conor walk to the front door of her apartment.
45) 5) dialog: Are you kidding? I like your mom.        She's cool.
45) 8) text: Conor smiles, understanding.
45) 10) dialog: So, you want another -- foot rub?
45) 21) dialog: I'd be into that.
46) 5) dialog: Yep.
46) 17) text: He pulls TWO BEERS out, shuts the fridge and turns to find Conor standing there. He's wearing a REALLY TIGHT, SHINY SHIRT and EVEN TIGHTER, VERY BLUE JEANS.
46) 21) dialog: Funny.
46) 22) text: Conor grabs the beer and opens it.
46) 26) dialog: It's for work. I'm trying to expand my client base.
46) 30) dialog: No.   By being more gay friendly.
46) 34) dialog: Nice.    I may have to use that.
46) 35) text: Conor heads back toward his room.
46) 37) dialog: I'm gonna try something else. This may be too much.
46) 41) dialog: It's not that she won't sleep with me douchebag...I have slept with her. It's just, you know, she...um...
46) 52) text: Conor reappears, now wearing A FRENCH CONNECTION TYPE TIGHT T-SHIRT AND BLACK JEANS.
46) 54) dialog: Pretty much, yeah. (re: his new outfit) So, what do you think?
46) 58) text: Conor rolls his eyes and heads back into his room.    Ale laughs to himself and takes another sip of beer.
57) 1) text: TWO WELL BUILT MEN (SKIP and LARRY) sip from bottles of Volvic water as they wander through a kitchen, inspecting the cabinetry. Conor comes into to frame, wearing a toned down version of his "gay friendly" clothes.
57) 3) dialog: Hello, my name is Conor. Please sign in whenever you get a chance.
57) 4) text: He gestures to a guest book on the kitchen island - next to which Anna stands. Conor joins her.
57) 8) dialog: I know.    Your friend Mary's a genius.
57) 19) dialog: You got a class?
57) 23) dialog: Sure.
57) 24) text: Conor goes in for a HUG, but Anna's not ready for it - so he just ends up grabbing her. It's awkward. She leaves, Conor tries to play it off, looks around the room.
57) 27) dialog: What?
57) 31) dialog: I'm not sure I get your meaning.
57) 34) text: Conor looks at them, decides not to fight it.
57) 36) dialog: It's killing me. Literally.     I'm dying.
57) 41) dialog: I just - I have no idea what she's doing. I cannot read her signals - at all. We used to sleep together - all the time. Well, that's not true, I don't know why I said that, it wasn't all the time. But it did happen - I know I'm not making this up. And then, out of nowhere, it stops. But she still calls, she stops by, she sleeps on my couch, she wants a massage, she leaves cute messages - but it never goes ANYWHERE. I mean, what is she doing?
57) 63) dialog: You're right. That's no help at all.
57) 71) text: Conor takes this in - that's not a bad idea.
86) 2) text: The doorbell RINGS, Anna gets up to answer it. Almost as soon as she turns the knob, Conor is standing in the middle of her studio apartment. He is all amped up.
86) 7) dialog: See, why did you call me sweetie?
86) 12) dialog: Why?
86) 15) dialog: I want to say something, OK? I mean, we call each other sweetie, and we fall asleep on the phone after talking for hours and I washed your hair for you after you had that shoulder surgery and everything - it's like we're together.
86) 27) dialog: Let me finish. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe I haven't been clear about what I want. So let me be clear. I love hanging out, but I am so attracted to you, and I just - I want both. I want to make love to you. I know that sounds kind of embarrassing coming out of my mouth - I just freaked myself out, too - but it's true. And I'm not sure what happened, or why we stopped - but I don't really care. I just --
86) 30) text: Conor is STUNNED.
86) 32) dialog: What?
86) 36) dialog: I'm talking about really doing this. Like a full-on relationship.
86) 40) dialog: With me.
86) 45) dialog: Did a bunch of gay people put you up to this?
87) 1) text: Conor sleeps peacefully with his limbs wrapped around Anna. Anna lays on her back, eyes wide open, STARING AT THE CEILING. She's clearly not at peace.
97) 1) text: Conor and Anna climb the stairs of a three story row house. A "FOR SALE" sign is outside.
97) 5) dialog: I know it's crazy. But it's a neighborhood "in transition."
97) 9) dialog: Yeah. Hip gay people, young couples, young families.
97) 10) text: Conor smiles as Anna heads into the house.
98) 11) text: Anna looks up to Conor, who is just watching her.
98) 15) dialog: Well, the open house is tomorrow. But I have this one buyer. I mean, I want to see if his girlfriend likes it first -
98) 19) dialog: I mean, I had this idea -
98) 20) text: Conor looks - all of a sudden - to be sweating.
98) 24) dialog: No, an idea. For this house. For - me. To buy. And hopefully, if you like it and things continue to - you know...
98) 25) text: Anna turns to face Conor, trying to put this together.
98) 27) dialog: Anna, look. I have a plan. I know where my life is going. And I want you to go with me. I mean - I'm not saying you have to move in now or anything - I just - I don't want to buy a place that you couldn't - at some point - see yourself moving into.
98) 28) text: Conor takes her hands in his.   Anna starts to PANIC.
98) 30) dialog: So what do you think? I mean gut reaction. I always go with my gut when it comes to real estate or ---
98) 38) text: Anna looks at him. And at the PULL DOWN IRONING BOARD. She looks at the ironing board a long time, before turning back to Conor, holding back tears.
98) 42) dialog: OK.   If it's too fast -
98) 45) text: Anna looks at him for a long time, not knowing how to say this. Conor looks at her, struggling, and suddenly sees it in her face. The answer he's been looking for. It all dawns on him in an instant.
98) 47) dialog: You don't want it with me.
98) 48) text: Anna NODS sadly.   Conor takes this in.   A LONG BEAT.
98) 50) dialog: So, I have a question.
98) 54) dialog: Is it too late to dial it back to before - and just keep sleeping together?
98) 55) text: Anna LAUGHS, and it breaks the tension.   Conor smiles.
98) 57) dialog: Because I thought that really -    you know - gelled.
98) 58) text: Anna goes to Conor and HUGS him.
102) 11) text: Alex reaches into his pocket and pulls out a PEN. THE SAME PEN THAT GIGI PRETENDED TO BE RETURNING TO CONOR. Gigi tries, without success, to suppress a SMILE.
106) 3) text: Conor, with a NATTILY DRESSED GAY COUPLE, stands on the street watching. Nathan calls down from the float.
106) 10) text: With that, the two Nattily Dressed Gays grab Conor, and climb up onto the float. They SHOUT over the music.
106) 22) text: Conor looks at Mary and SMILES. All of the gay men around them start to DANCE. LIKE REALLY, REALLY DANCE.
106) 26) dialog: You, too.
106) 29) dialog: Would you like to dance?
106) 32) text: Conor takes her hand - and the two of them do an old fashioned slow dance on the float. As everyone freaks around them, they smile and dance in each others' arms.
110) 5) text: Then, a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Mary gets up, grabs her little purse, and opens the door. IT'S CONOR. Mary smiles, her face barely able to contain her happiness.
