JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - JUDGE AND VINNY ~ LATE AFTERNOON The most noticeable thing about the judge's chambers is t expanse of books lining the walls. Vinny‘s seated in fron SUDGE CHAMBERLAIN HALLER. Vinny is wearing a shirt and pa no jacket or tie.
18) 1) dialog: A little informal aren't we? Not wearing a coat or tie.
18) 3) dialog: Well, approving an attorney from out of state is a pretty informal matter. I just have a few questions.
18) 5) dialog: Where did you go to law school?
18) 7) dialog: The Brooklyn Academy of Law? Is that an accredited law school? The judge’s subtly elitist response makes Vinny instantly he has somehow flunked the first question.
18) 9) dialog: How long have you been practicing?
18) 14) dialog: Any murder cases?
18) 16) dialog: And what was the outcome?
18) 18) dialog: This is not the forum to be cavalier.
18) 20) dialog: No.. What else?
18) 22) dialog: Good.
18) 24) dialog: The fellah who received orders to kill from a dawg?
18) 26) dialog: You defended him?
18) 30) dialog: Well...we don’t have any ‘serial Killers’ in Beechum County, but what we do have is every bit as sophisticated a system of justice as they do in the rest of the country. (beat) You being from New York and all, might have the impression that law is practiced with a degree of informality down here. It isn't. (explaining) I tell you this because I want you to know when it comes to procedure, I’m not a patient man. I advise you sir, when you cone into my courtroom, you are to know the letter of the law ~ I will react harshly when I find you don’t. Don’t think being from New York that you’re gonna get special treatment. You won’t. You will be given no leeway whatsoever. He takes an official-looking, 700 page book titled Alabam ef Criminal Procedure off a shelf, and puts it on the des front of Vinny.
18) 31) dialog: I expect you to know this information when you enter ny courtroom. Are you're willing to accept those terns?
23) 21) dialog: Counselor, your clients are charged with first degree murder. How do they plead?
23) 23) dialog: (interrupting, insulted) Don’t talk to me sittin’ in that chair.
23) 25) dialog: (interrupting) When you’re addressing this court, you will rise and speak to me in a clear, intelligible voice.
23) 27) dialog: What’ra you wearing?
23) 29) dialog: When you come into my court looking like you do, you not only insult me, but you insult the integrity of this court. (CONTINUED)
23) 35) dialog: Next time you come into my courtroom, you Will look ‘lawyerly’ - and I mean you’ll comb your hair, and wear a suit and tie = and that suit better be made out of some kind of...cloth. Do you understand me? Vinny’s taken back by all this. He capitulates. The judge
23) 37) dialog: Good. You may continue. How do your clients plead? gestures for Vinny to continue.
23) 39) dialog: (beat, confused) What’re you telling me? That they plead not guilty?
23) 41) dialog: I don’t want to hear explanations. The State of Alabama has its procedure and that procedure at this point in time is to have an arraignment. Are we clear on this? Stan doesn’t like what’s going on. He looks at Bill, who confused. (CONTINUED)
23) 45) dialog: (interrupting) Mr. Gambone, all I ask from you is a very simple answer to a very simple question. There are only two ways to answer it: Guilty or Not Guilty.
23) 47) dialog: Once again the communication process has broken down. It appears to me that you want to skip the arraignment process, go directly to trial, skip that and get a dismissal. I‘m not about to revamp the entire judicial process because you find yourself in the unique position of defending clients who say they ‘didn’t do it’. The only thing being tried today is my patience. (slowly, condescendingly) Now, the next words out of your mouth will either be ‘guilty’, er ‘not guilty’. If I hear anything other than ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’, you’1l be in contempt. I don’t want to hear commentary, argument or opinion, I don’t even want to hear you clear your throat - because if you do, you will be in contempt. I hope I’ve been clear. Now... (slowly)
23) 52) dialog: (interrupting) No, I don’t think you do. You’re now in contempt of court. Would you like to go for two counts of contempt? The judge makes a motion with his hands that the ball is Vinny’s court.
23) 54) dialog: Thank you! Bail will be set at $200,000. A preliminary hearing will be set for 9:30am tomorrow morning. (to prosecutor) Is that sufficient time?
23) 56) dialog: Bailiff, please take Mr. Gambone into custody. His bail will be set at $200. (CONTINUED)
31) 25) dialog: Mr. Gambino?
31) 27) dialog: Do you have anything to add?
31) 29) dialog: It’s not for me to say. (CONTINUED)
31) 32) dialog: (to Trotter) Do you have any other witnesses?
31) 34) dialog: The Court finds sufficient evidence exists for this matter to go to trial. Stan and Bill siump in their seats, resigned to fate. * (CONTINUED)
31) 37) dialog: I’m setting this matter for trial this Monday, February 2nd, 10 a.m. Mr. Gambone, stand up. (Vinny stands) Now didn’t I tell you the next time you appear in my court that you dress appropriately?
56) 5) dialog: Mr. Gambone, I’m not going to let you take part in jury selection tomorrow. I just got a fax fron the New York State Office of Judicial Records -they have no _ records of any Vincent Gambone °* trying any case in any court in the entire state of New York.
