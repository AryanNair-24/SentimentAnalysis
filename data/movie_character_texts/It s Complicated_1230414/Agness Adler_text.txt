The DOORS OPEN and Jane looks into an empty hallway, facing a SIGN that reads, Santa Barbara Fertilit Center. Helping Couples Become Parents.

57) 20) text: Adam, this is Agness, Jake's wife... (suddenly realizing) Now that is an odd sentence for me to say since that was me for most of my life. Seriously. How weird is that? Both of us married to the same man! AGNESS
57) 23) text: Because there, is...fascinating. I mean, when you think about it, it sort of links us in some cosmic                         crazy way, doesn't it, Agness? Of                       all the men on the planet, we both said "I do" to this guy. AGNESS

72) 16) text: Okay. Let me explain. The reason I left Agness wasn't just because my marriage wasn't working. (The Kids wait...) I've also fallen in love...back in love... with your mother. Or maybe I never stopped loving her. GABBY
