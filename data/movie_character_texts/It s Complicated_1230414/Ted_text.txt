5) 0) text: This is Jane's other home. A large, bright, bustling BAKERY/RESTAURANT. The bakery counter could rival any in Paris. Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au chocolat the best in the United States. A line waits to g in. A very relaxed Jane is behind the busy counter, easily mo between her young staff. The atmosphere is efficient and friendly. Jane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches ins the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped wi powdered sugar. She carries the tray to the open pass- through to the BUSY KITCHEN and calls to the head Baker.

20) 12) text: About ten years. I bought this                         place right after my divorce but                       it's taken me until now to be able                     to finally do this....

23) 27) text: Didn't you always say you felt you weren't being heard? Wasn't that our big issue -- both of us always feeling rejected and unappreciated. Look at us now. You're so much more together, you're not exhausted all the time, you're not catering every weekend and busy all day with the kids and I'm calmer, less obsessed about work. I'm a partner. I'm there. We grew into the people            we wanted each other to be! And I             don't know... I appreciate things about you I couldn't even see before. JANE

30) 13) text: Actually, I find it really stressful. You know, the last time I was in the dating world was 1978.                       It's a little more complicated these days. I can't tell you how                          nice it is to have a conversation                         with a woman and have the pressure off. Not to mention, a home cooked meal that no one else I know could possibly cook. Jane's not sure if she feels a little hurt by that.   She smiles, wiping the counter. ADAM
33) 10) text: My marriage is... not turning out as I hoped. That's obvious.... Agness started out really looking up to me... We never used to fight but now... with the kid....lately we're all about where he's gonna go to school and now she says we need            a bigger house, more help. I was thinking of cutting back at work...           now that's never gonna happen. And            she wants another baby before Pedro gets too old which I get but since we're always fighting... oh, God, listen to me. JANE

(the Cop nods, pulls away) Oh my God! That was horrifying. I instantly saw myself in a mug shot. My heart is leaping out of my... (then distracted) Wow... This is the most insane dashboard I've ever seen. It's like we're in a cockpit. It's spectacular. Adam, what kind of car is this? ADAM

76) 6) text: Knowing how to be divorced is next to impossible... and sometimes over the years, I've thought that your Dad and I weren't quite finished. And, as it turns out, we weren't. So I went out of my comfort zone, which, I found out, if you're really honest with yourself, isn't all that comforting. So, I experimented with a part of myself. I wanted to find out if, after all these years there was still something there between us. LAUREN
