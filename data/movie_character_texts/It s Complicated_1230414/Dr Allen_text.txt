37) 1) dialog: You know, things happen in life and                    our job is to find out why. What                       we have to do is take a real look at this. Are you ready to do that?

Like, I'd like you                    to say... Don't do this, it's absolutely wrong or go ahead, you'll be fine. I actually want to be told what to do. DR. ALLEN
37) 13) text: I'm sorry. I need more concrete. Are you saying I should keep seeing him? Because, honestly, if the                      guilt and fear could go away, maybe I could let go a little and figure                  this out. DR. ALLEN
