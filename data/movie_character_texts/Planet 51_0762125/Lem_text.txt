Up from the middle of the room rises a platform containin the star machine and its OPERATOR: LEM, a high-school junior, 16, passionate, fairly geeky, yet kind of cute fo someone with green skin. It's his voice we were hearing. He's about to continue with his lecture, but he's new and uneasy in this job. He stumbles, dropping his script. Bending down to pick it up, he knocks the star machine, making it pivot 180 degrees, sending stars flying all ove the dome. The kids OOOOH and AHHHHH, loving it, covering his mistak or so it seems. But Lem looks over to an older man sittin prominently in front: This is the CURATOR. He takes notes Lem's presentation, grading him. From his face, the grade far doesn't look good. From nearby, Lem hears: PSSSST. He turns to see SKIFF sitting nearby. Lem's age, Skiff is quirky, paranoid. He motions for Lem to keep going and gi him an encouraging thumbs up. Lem makes himself continue. He hits some buttons on the s machine as he narrates the following:
5) 1) dialog: How vast is space? If you could stretch a rope from one end to the other, it would reach over 500 miles!! Ooooohs from the audience.
5) 2) dialog: Ever try counting the stars? Don't bother, there's too many. Over ONE
5) 4) dialog: I'll bet you think stars are tiny points of light. Wrong! On the dome, Lem zooms into an individual star.
5) 5) dialog: Each star is over 3 feet wide!! And so hot it can boil water!!! The biggest set of Oooooohhhhs. Lem brings up an image of their planet, struggling a bit shove the slide in the right slot.
5) 6) dialog: But don't worry about our planet. It's so far from the nearest star, nothing could ever happen to it. Maybe the real planet is, but Lem put the slide of the planet in wrong. It starts to catch fire, causing the planet's image on the dome to bust into hellish flames as their planet is dying. A terrified MOAN from the kids, some SCREAMING and CRYING
6) 0) text: Kids are filing out. ON THE CURATOR, summing up Lem's score as two boys file past. He overhears:
6) 4) dialog: He's a riot, isn't he? Aliens. (to Eckle, condescends) Science proves there's no aliens. (to Curator) Too many comic books. Lem taps Eckle's head to indicate brain damage. The Curat marks another box on Lem's score. It's not looking good.

(NOTE: I like this scene here because it feels like a precursor to the alien arriving and also incorporates information about their world. Also, I'm not sure we need introduce Base 9 here. The key information for us now is that an alien ship is arriving. I'm concerned we're putti too much on our audience by introducing Base 9.) cur TO:

A NASA landing module approaches and slowly lands. Pause. The hatch opens. Out steps an astronaut. Like the first man on the moon, he charges out in self-simulated, gravity slow-motion and plants the American flag in the ground. Then he looks around and realizes: He's in suburbia on a strange planet. Eckle's and Lem's parents stare in shock. Eckle realizes it's a spaceman like the kind in his comic book. Beaming, grabs a pen to get the alien's autograph. The astronaut, already freaked, takes a step back. Throug his POV we see Eckle's Dad holding the big fork with cook meat in a way that could be seen as hostile. Then the automatic sprinkler is triggered, coming between he and h ship.
