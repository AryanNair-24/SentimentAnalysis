Up from the middle of the room rises a platform containin the star machine and its OPERATOR: LEM, a high-school junior, 16, passionate, fairly geeky, yet kind of cute fo someone with green skin. It's his voice we were hearing. He's about to continue with his lecture, but he's new and uneasy in this job. He stumbles, dropping his script. Bending down to pick it up, he knocks the star machine, making it pivot 180 degrees, sending stars flying all ove the dome. The kids OOOOH and AHHHHH, loving it, covering his mistak or so it seems. But Lem looks over to an older man sittin prominently in front: This is the CURATOR. He takes notes Lem's presentation, grading him. From his face, the grade far doesn't look good. From nearby, Lem hears: PSSSST. He turns to see SKIFF sitting nearby. Lem's age, Skiff is quirky, paranoid. He motions for Lem to keep going and gi him an encouraging thumbs up.
