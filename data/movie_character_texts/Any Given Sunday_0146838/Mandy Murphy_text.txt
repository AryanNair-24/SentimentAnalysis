8) 61) dialog: You're that coach, aren't you?
8) 63) dialog: Wow! Hi. I'm Mandy Murphy. I can't believe it. I thought it was you but I wasn't sure. You look different on TV.
8) 65) dialog: Yeah. You look much better in real life. You're always yelling at people on TV. (CONTINUED)
8) 71) dialog: You do...
8) 73) dialog: How old do you want me to be? (as he shrugs; smiles) I don't think age matters. I really don't. I think older guys have a certain thing.
8) 75) dialog: Yeah. Older guys are the nicest guys. At least in my experience... (she gently touches his hand) You know, I always wanted to meet you... ever since I was about 17, I was going with this football jock -- and I saw you on the sidelines. You were winning this big game...
8) 77) dialog: Yeah, that's it! That was wild. (as Tony laughs) I'd never repeat this -- only to you, you promise to keep this a secret -- ?
8) 82) dialog: (whispers into his ear) .+. I uh... started masturbating to football games watching you... (also: AD LIBS)... Tony's taken aback. She touches his knee, goes further.
8) 83) dialog: «++. you wanna go out with me... ‘Coach'?
8) 85) dialog: Yeah, like on a date... (leaning close) I got a place -- close by, quiet... It's a thousand... five thousand for the night. You won't regret it... (pause) What do you say, handsome?
8) 87) dialog: You sure? I got friends. (indicating Monroe returning alone from restroom) I could do your friends too.
8) 89) dialog: (disappointed) Fair enough. Hey, good luck with the team. I'll be rooting for you... ‘Tony' A plucky kiss on his cheek. She slinks away, as Monroe sits, enrapt by her legs.
51) 14) dialog: Backpedal?
51) 17) dialog: (crossing to bed) Your genes, her genes... did you get a quarterback out of it?
51) 19) dialog: (props herself over Tony) You know what you need?
51) 21) dialog: You need to be... young again! She attacks him, tickling him all over. Like a boy, Tony giggles; it's been a long time since he'd been tickled.
51) 34) dialog: Leave him on. He's cool.
51) 36) dialog: I like him. He doesn't buy into the bullshit... I like his eyes. He's sure of himself -- makes him sexy. Tony looks at Willie, wondering. Being with someone as young as Mandy permits him to understand. He pulls a blank check from his robe.
51) 38) dialog: (laughs) Is it good? Prefer credit card or cash, but this one time -- okay...
51) 40) dialog: (starting to dress) No, I don't think so, but thanks...
51) 46) dialog: (senses his need) Okay. Coffee'd be great. He goes as she continues to dress, watching.
51) 55) dialog: Sure. I've got a few clients like that. We can book a regular time. I'll give you my service number and they can set it up direct with... Writing...
51) 57) dialog: Oh, honey...
51) 59) dialog: You don't really wanna do this.
51) 61) dialog: I like you too, Tony, but you really don't want to do this. A beat. She gives him her business number in lipstick.
