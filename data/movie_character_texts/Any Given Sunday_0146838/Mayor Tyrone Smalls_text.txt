15) 0) text: The stars are out tonight. Establishment Miami meets football jocks meets business supporters meets politicos, meets sex and alcohol. It's also a charity event, designed by the Sharks' P.R. Department to deliver a Children's Needy Fund some million dollars a year, most of which is being raised tonight -- with, naturally, the colorful Mayor Tyrone Smalls in attendance. Julian Washington ROARS up to the dock in a dramatic CIGARETTE BOAT -- product logos for his sponsors all over it. Four gorgeous girls cling to him. Flashbulbs explode, the paparazzi eating this up as much as Julian.

17) 2) dialog: (dramatic) The city of Miami would like to thank Christina Pagniacci, you are a great Miamian! You have done as much as anyone to eliminate drugs and crime from our city streets... -+. and your Sharks have provided wonderful role models for our inner-city youth to look up to. I'm all for it, honey, now let's get down and party!! Raucous laughter. People have long come to accept the Mayor's idiosyncracies. Smalls greets Christina's mother, a blitzed Margaret, on the podium, escorted by Ed Phillips. Also there is Andy, Christina's yawning, tired husband. Observing this in the crowd are Willie and Vanessa, who feels herself out of place and underdressed for this affair. She excuses herself to the ladies' room... as Willie walks over to Sanderson and Julian.

27) 6) dialog: «+. how you gonna pay it back, darlin'?
27) 8) dialog: (mocking) ‘Personal seat licenses' -- that's the biggest bunch of bullshit! -- how the hell can you sell the same seat twice? I seen some pretty smooth scams in my time, but only a white man could come up with that one. The fans gonna burn you, honey. (CONTINUED)
27) 13) dialog: There ain't no bottom line, baby. It's an endless fucking pit! (genuinely) Your team's not doin' what the Dolphins are doin'. The schools're howling for money, roads need redoing, a new stadium's the last thing on the city council's mind...
27) 16) dialog: (smiles infuriatingly) Sweetheart, you outta here when the city and the county says you outta here. Your lease ain't up for two years so don't start setting fires you can't put out...
27) 22) dialog: (smiles ) Now that's the Pagniacci I believe! I see your teeth! Get down, girl!
27) 24) dialog: Yadda, yadda, yadda! Daddy's girl, you are a relative baby in this town. Go slow. First you get along... then you go along...

29) 8) dialog: Stadium's where it's at. Now they invented these ‘naming rights' and 'P.S.L.s'. It's all tricky doo. We don't have the money for that stadium. You guys gotta fight through it till you have a successful season. That's the reality... ‘Lady Di' there thinks she's pulling the wool over my eyes and going to L.A. He laughs.
29) 10) dialog: (grins) -.. She ain't going nowhere. Keep it tight, Monty. Either way, you got a job here a long time to come. The Mayor returns to the party as Monroe looks down into the gardens for Tony. MUSIC WAFTS OUT from the party.
