0) 193) dialog: Come on! Hurry it up! Let's go... let's go!
1) 48) dialog: Look, you the offense, why do you think we work on the blitz package all week? We've lost two quarterbacks in one half of football ‘cause our line can't pick up a goddamn backside bandit on max protection!! You and I know this is goddamn stupid football, and you're stressing this shit outta me! We've worked on the calls over and over again but you have no goddamn focus or concentration! McKenna, keep your head on a swivel, you've got to slide out there and pick up that robber -- roll up those outside linebackers! Beamen, know your site adjustments! Sanderson and Fox will break off their routes but you have to deliver it on time. We've had two goddamn turnovers this half, you guys are dumping on my turnover ratio. You the defense, you've got to create something out there, you've got to start flying around the fucking ball and hitting somebody. Don't let these assholes chew up the clock on us! On first down, they're killing us with the weakside slant. Corners, when we put eight in the box, you've got to jam the receivers, take ‘em on, you're hesitating! If you're gonna make a mistake, go on! Make it a big one! I'm not gonna eat your lunch for that, but don't fuck around like pussies at a pee party, you hear me?!... P.J., Mac, Beast Man, Horny, Shark! One, two yards less each time and they'll be two and eight instead of two and six! Stuff the goddamn run. They're killing us! No more stupid penalties, okay?! Concentrate. Focus. We're only down by three points. We can win this mother! I'm sick and tired of losing! Are you?! Three losses in a row. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
1) 51) dialog: Are you guys sick and tired of this?! Stand up if you're not! Raise your hand! Raise your hand if you're a pussy! Stand up, let's go! The team is poised, clenching up, except for Washington who rises laconically.
1) 52) dialog: What the hell you doing, J?!
1) 55) dialog: Gentlemen, this is our house! We live here. Don't let them fuck with us in our own house! We're gonna get some points on the goddamn board if I gotta get out there myself and throw the goddamn ball! Now let's go and kick some second-half butt!
2) 23) dialog: ... Kid's fast, but he ain't gonna last, Nick!
2) 27) dialog: He may be a ballerina, but where's the brain? He just called another play that doesn't exist! Goddamn! Settle him down, Nick!
2) 31) dialog: What the hell was that?! You just don't fling the goddamn ball downfield into traffic like...
2) 33) dialog: We called Go Z Read! What the hell are you doing changing the play when you feel like it, without even knowing who the hell you're...
2) 36) dialog: (seething) Daylight? Shut the fuck up and listen to me! Listen to me now!... You're a new player on this team. You got me? (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
2) 42) dialog: You are nobody to me or anybody else here till you prove yourself. And you start that by doing what you're fucking told! You got that?
2) 44) dialog: Now get out of my face and next time you're out there, control the goddamn ball! He stalks off. Willie, closed off by Tony's intensity, moves to the bench.
2) 59) dialog: Okay, what's wrong, Willie? What's wrong?
2) 61) dialog: Just take a breath now. Believe me when I say you can only get better, kid -- and you don't have to worry about getting the hook -- ‘cause I got no one left, okay? He grins.
2) 65) dialog: Look at me. Look at me, son... You know how to play the game. You been playing it all your life, right?
2) 67) dialog: You grew up in Dallas, right?
2) 69) dialog: Okay, maybe you're back in Dallas right now. You're enjoying yourself. You're back in the ""hood," right before your mama calls you for dinner. Go to the Buick, turn around and I'll throw it to you, you throw it back. A game of catch, remember that?
2) 71) dialog: My point is -- Willie -- just forget about the crowd and the formations and the audibles and the whole goddamn playbook. Just focus on this one next pass. (carefully) Willie -- go to the Buick and turn around. There's a special, soothing tone to the way D'Amato expresses himself, when he wants. A voice that makes you believe.
2) 120) dialog: Deuce Left 22 Red Beast Read.
2) 122) dialog: Maybe they're looking for the pick. I'm not taking chances. Not with this ballerina.
2) 129) dialog: That's just it. I know this coach, Nick! And he's a prick. It's a set-up. Run it again. Deuce Left 22 Red Beast Read.
2) 132) dialog: You heard me. Crozier relays the call.
2) 146) dialog: Time-outs are for TV. Negative! 88 89 90 91 Ag1 40.
3) 7) dialog: Listen to me, kid... (waits till Willie gives him his eyes) On any given Sunday you're gonna win or you're gonna lose. The point is -- can you win or lose like a man? Out there today you played like a man. That's what counts.
3) 10) dialog: When you're my age, kid, you get used to it. (to all) Awright, everybody, lissen up! You played your hearts out! No blame... nobody! Let's get on our knees... Father... The team assumes a collective prayer position; Tony signals the team CHAPLAIN.
4) 27) dialog: You know, Jack, I've always loved the running game, but I read so much about it ‘cause of you, I decided I'm gonna give it up.
4) 29) dialog: No, reading you. (as they all laugh at Jack) The pass is great, but it's 2-3 guys involved. But a sweep -- y'ever really study a sweep, Jack --
4) 31) dialog: Eleven men pulling together, concentrating... like a mind machine in perfect sync, hitting every block and hole, it's so damn beautiful! Football, Jack, at its purest.
4) 33) dialog: (looks at his watch) No, it means I'm late to see Management. Tell you what, if I don't have the job tomorrow, you'll be the first one to know, Jack, okay? He leaves abruptly.
6) 0) text: Coach D'Amato enters to find Cap Rooney in bed, his lower back and legs supported, a morphine drip in one arm and an IV in the other, unnaturally white and swollen from the hits -- doing his stoic best to abide the searing pain in his back. Flowers fill the crevices of the room. He's on a speaker phone with the boss, Christina -- while Cindy, his concerned and devoted wife, acknowledges Tony with a head nod.
6) 12) dialog: How ya doing, Rock?
6) 14) dialog: Nah, Beamen did okay. It was Julian fumbled, they beat us by three.
6) 16) dialog: 9 of 14, for 176.
6) 18) dialog: Two. (CONTINUED)
6) 24) dialog: The pain's bad, kid.
6) 26) dialog: I could use a drink myself. He pours himself some water distastefully, as Cap plays with his pump.
6) 29) dialog: She's dreamin'.
6) 31) dialog: She's President now -- what's more to say.
6) 36) dialog: You just gotta get over this Montana thing, Rock. You're never gonna be that good.
6) 38) dialog: Take it easy, will ya! Don't overachieve. Breathe. Even at 50 percent, there's nobody better out there...
6) 40) dialog: It's late. I'1l stop by in the morning. Get some rest. ‘Night, Cindy. She acknowledges him.
6) 42) dialog: (beat) You're like a son to me, Cap. I'll fight for you till the day I die. He exits as the PHONE RINGS and Cindy follows Tony out.
8) 7) dialog: (re: TV) Glad he's not talking about me. (CONTINUED)
8) 15) dialog: (signals the bartender) You get any more stats in those goddamn computers what the hell you need a coach for anymore? I mean it's like we're all rushing forward here -- faster, bigger, smarter. We're all thinking too damned much... we're not even looking around at what we're passing by, leaving behind... You know what I mean?
8) 22) dialog: Thanks (nickname)... (to all, noting his caricature above) Y'know, I'm starting to look like that guy. That's what's fucking scary.
8) 25) dialog: Nick, I'm not re-doing the whole goddamn game plan for Cherubini with three more games. The linemen aren't that quick, y'know what I mean?... and when Cap comes back for the playoffs, he's gonna go crazy with a whole new calling scheme, different rhythms, shit!...
8) 28) dialog: (starting to anger) Hey, Nick -- when you get your team, you do it your way. But don't let me catch you telling anyone Cap Rooney's not comin' back, okay? I don't care what Mrs. Pagniacci Junior says. Stay out of it!... I've seen Cap do this for years. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
8) 32) dialog: When he sets his mind to it, he'll walk right in there -- maybe ‘gainst the Emperors -- and he'll shine just like a new dime, that's how fucking great this guy is! Never underestimate 'Rock' Rooney, okay?...
8) 36) dialog: (changes subject) +. y'know every time I drink more than two of these, I think of Jeanette...
8) 38) dialog: (grimaces ) We try talkin’ but we sound like two undertakers talkin’ shop...
8) 40) dialog: Y'ever try living with her, Monty...? She was nuts. Went fundamentalist on me.
8) 51) dialog: (chimes in) You forgot the fourth thing, Monty -- a defense! I know it's old- fashioned to keep the other team from scoring, but it's effective.
8) 62) dialog: Yeah, Tony D'Amato. He shakes hands.
8) 64) dialog: You think so?
8) 70) dialog: (pointing to the caricature) Yeah well at least I look better than that old fart... I think?
8) 72) dialog: (starting on another Scotch) Thanks. How old are you, Mandy?
8) 74) dialog: Oh yeah?
8) 76) dialog: You mean the Pantheon Cup...?
8) 78) dialog: I promise. (CONTINUED)
8) 84) dialog: You mean like on a date?
8) 86) dialog: Thank you. I'm flattered, but...
8) 88) dialog: Thanks, Mandy... some other time maybe.
8) 95) dialog: .-. I must really be drunk.
8) 97) dialog: (laughs, segues) ++. you think we're slowing down, Monty?
8) 99) dialog: »+. you think you can lose your coaching instincts?
8) 101) dialog: Well, that last play today, there was a moment when... I didn't know what to call... that's never happened to me like that before... in 22 seasons...
8) 103) dialog: All I have are my instincts. I lose them... I got nothin’... (noticing) Say, what'd you do to Crozier? Stuff him in the toilet? 100 62.
9) 0) text: The letter "L" is written with a black marker next to the Americans on the season schedule (Miami is now 7-6). Ther are only three games left in the regular season: Chicago, California and New York. Tony cradles a cordless phone while drinking Scotch, as a COMPUTERIZED VOICE introduces Jeanette's voice on the answer machine.
9) 2) dialog: (into his cordless) Hi, Jeanette, it's Tony... I was hoping you'd still be awake. What time is it out there anyway? I tried to call earlier but things got... never mind. Listen... He walks into his bedroom, emptying his pockets on the dresser. Pictures of the past confront him -- Jeanette, a boy and a girl; another of Tony with Cap Rooney and Art Pagniacci winning the "Pantheon Cup."
9) 3) dialog: «+. tell Tommy we gotta game in L.A. In a couple of weeks. I'm hoping we could maybe get together?... I don't have his new number but... the thing is I'd like to see him and... and you...? (he weaves, stumbles as he looks for something he dropped on the rug) I really miss the shit outta Timmy and Melinda... Y'know, love to see them, Jesus! Grandkids, Jeanette, we got grandkids... Anyway, what's there to say? Cap got hurt Sunday. Just another heart-breaking Sunday right? (pause) Okay, well, bye... He has crossed to the toilet, where he unsuccessfully tries to urinate -- all over the place. A COMPUTERIZED VOICE suddenly cuts in to tell him:
9) 7) dialog: Aw shit!
13) 0) text: Tony looks hungover and bumps into something, as Christin crosses into the giant-sized living room.
13) 2) dialog: Christina... Ed. You know, I keep looking for the A.T.M. machines in these houses...
13) 5) dialog: (rolls his eyes) No. I already had breakfast... at four this morning.
13) 13) dialog: You can run that play a million times, Christy, but it ain't gonna change a thing. On any given Sunday...
13) 15) dialog: Actually I said it, but...
13) 17) dialog: Blame me, not Julian. It was my call.
13) 22) dialog: You're the one who negotiated his incentive clause.
13) 24) dialog: Pretty smart move, Christy. You want me to bench my All-Pro back? Any other suggestions? A testy edge to the dialogue, as Christina freezes the image of Julian fumbling. She shows him the sports section of USA Today -- folded to a condemnation of the team, specifically Tony. Although raised to treat Tony like an "uncle" in a large Italian-American family, the team comes first and foremost.
13) 26) dialog: (re: the newspaper) .». Your father'd laugh at this jerk, Christy. We're a solid team, and we're gonna get to the playoffs. This is not the time to panic.

13) 36) dialog: It's 'over'!? The hell it's over! We been there before -- I can pull this out. I always have. Worse things than this have...
13) 39) text: Tony is fuming, but a part of him knows she's right.
13) 40) dialog: (darkly, pacing) I was there, Christy -- remember? We're solid, we're just not inspired. We got too many free agents... (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
13) 45) dialog: (indicating the frozen tape) .-.. Julian's a 'merc' who's here for the money and he brings that attitude with him to the team. The end of the season, he goes. And we rebuild our running game and...
13) 47) dialog: Football is played on the field, Christina, not in the goddamn boxes! You knew that when you had candy stuck in your braces. When'd you forget it?
13) 53) dialog: If we'd gotten the linemen I wanted in the first place, our first two quarterbacks might still be walking.
13) 55) dialog: No, I don't know that, Christy, I don't! Cap's got two, maybe three great years left in him. This is football. Today guys in their 40s are playing... (a silence) Do I gotta remind you he helped build this franchise, which you benefitted from? That he's a hero to the working people of Florida. And one of the greatest pressure players of all time. You just don't cut a man like Cap Rooney!
13) 60) dialog: Shark changed linebacking forever! He made a quantum leap in the game!...
13) 62) dialog: (angry) That goes without saying. But I am not cutting Cap Rooney or Shark Lavay. No matter how much ‘'class' you do it with. (MORE )
13) 68) dialog: My contract is very clear on this point, Christy. I coach my way. I never tolerated interference from the front office and your father never interfered when...
13) 71) dialog: (intense) Fuck the economics! Your father, you hear me! Your father never interfered! He made it work!
13) 74) dialog: What's your point, Christy? (CONTINUED)
13) 78) dialog: I guess I had nothing to do with that. It was all your dad... Am I excused now? 73.
13) 81) dialog: (at the door) Are you saying my contract's up at the end of the year? And the ‘economics aren't there'? Is that what you're saying, Christy?
13) 83) dialog: You're not even close... You know how your dad and I used to negotiate my contract? We had a beer and we shook hands.
13) 85) dialog: (exits) No, I guess you don't. Christina shares a look with Ed. She shakes her head: "Beer?" 103 104 105 106 74.
14) 6) dialog: Get Beamen.
14) 13) dialog: How do you feel?
14) 15) dialog: Feel like throwin' up?
14) 17) dialog: Hey, last time you puked you had a hell of a game.
14) 19) dialog: Make a ritual out of it and people'll respect it... Go right at ‘em. Go with the spread. What I want from you is concentration. Focus. Downfield. Every inch. See it before you do it. You see it, you do it.
14) 21) dialog: So... What are you waiting for? Make me a believer. (CONTINUED)
14) 28) dialog: Will you teach the kid how to slide, for Chrissake, Nick! Before he kills himself! How many times I gotta tell you, I don't need another Julian out there --
14) 37) dialog: (to Willie) What the hell was that?!
14) 39) dialog: I know it was a goddamn bootleg! Julian passes Tony, shaking his head... Willie gulps down Gatorade as Tony comes after him.
14) 40) dialog: «+. Bootleg? Very creative. I never thought of that in a million years. In fact, I didn't call that! I called a goddamn Double Tight Regular 22 Fox. You know what that is, son?
14) 43) dialog: You run the plays I call -- you with me, son?!
14) 48) dialog: (on headset) Is he fucking with me, Nick, or doesn't he know the play!?
14) 69) dialog: (headset) ... Now what in the holy see is he doing... Crozier?!
14) 86) text: Willie trots off the field, looking for D'Amato, about 15 or 20 yards away, with daring in eyes that say, "You want to win or not? Go fuck yourself!"... Cap, next to Tony, reads the situation, but the rest of the team, standing and milling, is simply awed by this new discovery.
20) 0) text: Tony and Margaret Pagniacci, leaning against an upstairs railing, take in a view of the party below; Margaret commenting on the AFFA Pantheon Cup ring that Tony wears tonight, part of his formal wear.
20) 1) dialog: ... These kinda places I keep looking for an A.T.M. machine...
20) 3) dialog: (offering her the ring) Nah. Just special occasions. Looks too weird. I get ona plane, I gotta check it...
20) 5) dialog: Margaret, we need someone... a football person out front who can...
30) 0) text: Margaret Pagniacci's holding onto Tony's AFFA ring, alone with him; he's had a little too much to drink.
30) 1) dialog: ‘Life begins with a kick-off,' Art used to say that... He was a great man, Maggie. He was there at the beginning. His kind, forget it! -- dust! Now they're all... (sees Christina approaching) know-it-all-E.S.P.N. analysts.
30) 8) dialog: How ‘bout you win one first?
30) 10) dialog: (getting up) No. Win one first. He walks away.
32) 3) dialog: Mind if I sit down? (as Willie nods, Tony sits) Whatcha listening to?
32) 5) dialog: Anyone I know?
32) 7) dialog: (shakes his head) Y'ever listen to jazz? (as Willie shrugs "who?") .-. Coltrane, Monk, Miles Davis, Billie Holiday?
32) 9) dialog: Maybe I'll put together a tape for you -- my favorites...?
32) 11) dialog: So, we'll forget about that... How ‘bout your mama, she ever gonna come to a game?
32) 13) dialog: «+. I don't know if you know this, I lost my dad when I was young, too... (waits) -.. in World War Two... (waits again) ... if you ever want to talk about stuff like that, I'm around...? Okay. (CONTINUED)

33) 24) dialog: All I ever did was...
33) 27) dialog: «+. You know I'll never forget a big mistake I made once as a coach. I hurt someone and... I couldn't change what I did, so I denied it. Threw some money at it... and then tried to forget it, block it out. (beat) You know what? It never goes away.
33) 29) dialog: Tom, come on, I... I'm sorry. I... (CONTINUED)

34) 10) dialog: Charlie, give me a goddamn break. I know this is L.A., I don't know nobody here, but give us a chance anyway! (indicating Referee #1) Where's that guy from? El Cajon, Hawthorne, Beverly Hills, what?
34) 13) dialog: What can you do? What can you do? The system's fucked! I mean games are being decided by zebras in stripes. It's just not fair! (then) What the fuck is ‘fair' anyway? 144 Shark lies on the field, moaning. Mandrake, Powers and Trainer #1 test his joints.
34) 25) dialog: (at Monroe) What the hell is going on, Monty!
34) 44) dialog: Goddamn it, Sammy, his knee was down! He was down by a mile. Both knees were down. Give me a goddamn break in this town -- that was no fumble!
34) 47) dialog: (a beat, shrugs) To be honest, Sammy, neither did I. Referee #3 shakes his head and runs back to the field as Mandrake hurries over to Tony.
34) 49) dialog: How long?
34) 59) dialog: Knock it off -- all of you! This goddamn screw-up cost us McKenna for the season! Why don't you both think about that for one goddamn minute! Sit down -- the bunch of you! (walking away, to Crozier, on the headset ) Goddamn it, Nick, you do your job and get him under control before he gets anyone else hurt! He notices a film crew in his face, recording all of this; this brings him to the very edge.
34) 60) dialog: Whatta you doing!! Get outta here before I kick your butts!!... Get ‘em out! Security quickly closes down the lens.

35) 61) dialog: That's a winning attitude, kid.
35) 70) dialog: What? What do you mean he's changing the plays?
35) 72) dialog: In the huddle?
35) 94) dialog: (warily) I was telling him how much I loved him. They laugh.
35) 96) dialog: Why is it every time you ask me a question, Jack, it sounds like, "so, did you beat your wife?' You goddamn know I don't have a wife, Jack, and you know I don't play golf and I hate fishing, barbecuing, and boating. I guess... wall-staring, I'm pretty good at that.
35) 102) dialog: No I didn't because I tell you what, this is what I got to say to you about the game, Jack: Fuck you, you stink, you know you stink, you wouldn't know the truth if it was in your own shit -- so go talk to one of these poor innocent schmuck kids you can misquote and destroy...

39) 23) dialog: It's not the big one, Cap. We can win at home or on the road with you. You know it's the smart thing to do. And one thing you always were was smart, Cap -- smarter than you were dumb.
39) 25) dialog: That's not what I'm saying --
41) 0) text: Tony's in his kitchen when the DOORBELL RINGS, laboring over a pot of jambalaya, wearing an apron reading: "Kiss My Chef." A BILLIE HOLIDAY RECORDING PLAYS. He goes.
41) 6) dialog: For me? Thanks... I guess I better put these in water or something. Come on in. Tony goes to the kitchen, looking at the flowers. Willie now gets it.
41) 9) dialog: Sit down.
41) 11) dialog: You wanna beer?
41) 14) text: Tony brings beers to Willie, glancing at Ben Hur on television; the irony slave ships and gladiators is not lost on Willie.
41) 16) dialog: (removing it) My ex-wife got it for me. It was a joke. I don't cook so great -- so don't expect anything too...
41) 21) dialog: Almost twenty years now... (off silence) Same old story, she got fed up with me working so hard. You know where they served the divorce papers? On the sidelines of the divisional playoff game in New York.
41) 23) dialog: Fuck her, we won the game.
41) 25) dialog: You ready? Tony leads Willie into a dining room, Willie glancing around, noting many football photos that grace the walls.
41) 28) dialog: ++. My own recipe. Sort of adapted from Paul Prudhomme's. Ever been to his place in New Orleans?
41) 30) dialog: Maybe get ‘em next season. Like no place on earth, New Orleans. How you like it?
41) 32) dialog: .»». Well, thanks for coming by. (CONTINUED)
41) 37) dialog: No... no. I just wanted to talk... (a beat) Willie, look, if I've been an asshole I'm sorry. Cap going down was really tough for me and maybe I've been taking some of that out on you. I know you're still learning the system and the pressure's incredible --
41) 39) dialog: I know. But we need to talk about this. I think you got a great future in football but first off we gotta deal with some basics. Like if the play book is too complicated we can simplify it for you --
41) 42) dialog: Listen, you're too fast out there as it is. You need to wait for the plays to develop. Our offense was built up over years, it's like Chinese water torture, taking apart the other team a little ata time, it's the death of 1,000 cuts.
41) 44) dialog: (stops eating) Is that why you been changing the plays? (CONTINUED)
41) 50) dialog: I'm not talking about audibles... Look, I know you like making the big plays. I understand that. But our game plans are the result of a lot of work and a lot of experience.
41) 52) dialog: I know you do. When you change plays you're showing disrespect to a lot of people in this organization --
41) 54) dialog: People who've worked for years in this club and around the League. People who've sacrificed more than you will ever know to be in this game. Willie sees where this is going.
41) 56) dialog: Okay, son, listen to me very carefully and remember what I'm going to tell you. You can forget every other goddamn thing I ever said if you remember this, because someday you're going to realize it's the truest thing you ever heard: This game has got to be about more than winning. (CONTINUED)
41) 59) text: Willie says nothing. Tony takes
41) 60) dialog: (relaxes a little) «+. I guess that's what I wanted to say. You're part of something here! A tradition. Lombardi, Unitas, Tittle, Sammy Baugh, hundreds of great players! Those men on the wall, you're part of that now. And along the way I want you to cherish that... ‘cause when it's gone, it's gone forever, and...
41) 62) dialog: «+. Looks like Cap's gonna make it back in time for the playoffs... I'm gonna start him.
41) 64) dialog: Cap's a leader... a team player. You need a team to win in the playoffs.
41) 66) dialog: Cap's the better player. (CONTINUED)
41) 73) dialog: You kicked ass, kid, but Cap Rooney has been ‘doing’ it for years and he goddamn deserves his day in the sun, so don't start...
41) 75) dialog: «+. He's been the quarterback of this team as long as...
41) 78) dialog: (seething) I've lived this game for three decades, kid, I know football. Those men --
41) 80) dialog: (furious) It's bullshit, huh! You think you... (CONTINUED)
41) 87) dialog: Don't play the race card with me, kid. Twenty-five years I've worked with men of your color. You're good because you're different, not because...
41) 89) dialog: What are you saying? You don't trust anybody ‘cause of what happened to you in college? You knew the rules, Willie, you broke ‘em.
41) 91) dialog: You broke ‘em. That's how you broke, ‘em.
41) 99) dialog: Blame anybody but yourself, Willie! yY'see, that's what a leader is about, the times he's gotta sacrifice because he has to lead by example, not by fear or...
41) 103) dialog: (quietly) You're not some flash-in-the-pan
41) 108) text: (imitating D'Amato) ‘Son, just pretend you're throwing a pass on the street in the ‘hood and your mama's ringing the dinner bell' -- all you done is talked at me, man, never listened to a goddamned thing I said! So don't have no coronary ‘cause I'm gonna stay who I am -- 'Steamin' Willie Beamen'! ‘Cause with the time I got left I'm gonna play my way and I'm gonna get my dollars up there so's when you motherfuckers trade me, waive me, injure reserve me, or whatever the fuck you do to me, I'm gonna be worth ten times what I was worth before! A long pause. Tony's eyes, moving past ego, scrambling to understand.
41) 109) dialog: I don't know... you are a very, very young man. And you are very, very stupid.
41) 115) dialog: You're wrong. I know better than you think, Willie...
50) 2) dialog: «+. I just can't get through. Used to be I could take anyone -- rookie, vet, bad-ass parolee -- didn't matter -- I could make them... see what I see.
50) 4) dialog: TV... It changed the way we think -- forever. First time they stopped the game because they had to cut to a commercial was the end of it. I mean it was our concentration that fucking mattered, not some fruitcake selling insurance... Tony notices, as does (CONTINUED)
50) 11) dialog: (passionate) Damnit, Monty, I don't know what more I can do. I've sweated blood for these men. I've given up my wife and my children for these men. I've given up everything I have to be on that sideline every Sunday. Everything! The game is all that matters to me. ‘Cause it's pure! Four quarters. You cross a line, you score. It's sane. Life isn't, it isn't... It doesn't make sense for me not to have a home, a life... you tolerate the madness for the game... but if that's not enough, then this game is asking for too goddamn much!
51) 3) dialog: Come on, Monty, one more.
51) 5) dialog: (snorts) Curfew! How the hell do you and Sheila do it anyway?
51) 7) dialog: (shakes his head) +. It's impossible!
51) 13) dialog: ... So Jeanette was 20, 21, I was just making it as a lowball assistant with San Diego -- Jock Harris was running the place then -- and one day we been romancing a year about and I says to her, 'So what about marriage?' And she says, ‘What about it?' And I says to her, ‘Well, I gotta see you backpedal first.' And she says...
51) 15) dialog: You know. Quarterback gotta be able to drop back -- ? Run backwards? You shoulda seen Jeanette's face. She gets up -- bless her Albanian soul! And she does it! She backpedals for me. In high beautiful heels too! All the way! Jeanette! Can you do
51) 18) dialog: Nah. Not even close. I had an insurance executive. (as they both laugh) How can you have one of them? Came out with a briefcase. (beat) .-. Nah, he's a beautiful kid.
51) 20) dialog: ... yeah, a pump.
51) 35) dialog: (mocking) ‘Cool'? My quarterback? He thinks he's Joe Montana already.
51) 37) dialog: Thank God I'm old. Check alright?
51) 39) dialog: (filing it out) You want a nightcap or something?
51) 41) dialog: How 'bout some coffee then?... Just stay for some coffee. Five minutes. (CONTINUED)
51) 54) dialog: I hope you like cream with your coffee... Mandy...? I like you. I'm wondering if we could maybe make this a more regular thing?
51) 56) dialog: I sort of meant... not like that. Without money.
51) 58) dialog: I know, but --
51) 60) dialog: I really like you.
51) 62) dialog: You got pretty hair, you know... Tony lingers for a moment, then sets his coffee down and leaves. Mandy watches after him in the mirror.
56) 12) dialog: (to line coach) Get_'em to stand up and block, goddamnit, Hank! What's going on?!
56) 26) dialog: (walks away) Then let him fucking learn!
57) 6) dialog: All right! Stop this now! Stop it!
57) 8) dialog: This kind of bush league crap doesn't cut it with me! Anybody who thinks otherwise can pack their bags right now! ‘Cause this shit is never gonna happen again! Ever! Is that clear...? You don't do that out there! Men get killed out there! (pause) «+. Thirty years in football, I never seen something that stinks like this! This is a violation! ... Today -- out there, you embarrassed yourselves and you embarrassed me. Today I am ashamed to be your coach! He stalks out.
59) 2) dialog: --. So what are the odds?
59) 11) dialog: I can't make this decision for you, Shark.
59) 13) dialog: (pause) ‘Course I do, Shark, but no, not at this price... no.
59) 16) dialog: (pause) You'll have to sign a waiver, Shark.
60) 3) dialog: You evil motherfucker -- !
60) 5) dialog: Shark's film! I know what you pulled, switching the results so Powers wouldn't pick up on it!
60) 7) dialog: I want you outta here. Today. Now.
60) 9) dialog: Did you bother consulting him! He could get killed out there!
60) 11) text: killed? Maybe, maybe not! It's one chance in a thousand, 'but nobody blitzes like the Shark,' right, Tony? (CONTINUED)
60) 15) dialog: You walk off this field and you get into your car and you go far away -- I never want to see you near one of my players again. Do you understand me? Never.
60) 18) dialog: No more -- !
60) 21) dialog: I will not have this discussion. Get out!
60) 42) dialog: (quietly) This I mean -- get out. Mandrake is genuinely sad to leave; he looks at Tony, not without affection.
61) 0) text: Tony heads back to his office, unfortunately intersecting Jack Rose with his crew, and several other reporters.
61) 2) dialog: (blind and sudden) Get the hell out of my way, you piece of...!! He shoves Rose out of his way and storms past. Rose slips into the dugout, smacking his head on the bench. Tony doesn't turn around, but everyone else tenses, expecting trouble.
63) 1) dialog: (entering) Hey, kids are growing, Cap. Johnny's already got big hands (the kid corrects his name, TBD).
63) 3) dialog: I forgot, Johnny, sorry, I got so many names in my head. (CONTINUED)
63) 7) dialog: Don't shoot me.
63) 10) text: coma. Think they're gonna suspend you, Tony?
63) 12) dialog: «+». Do me a favor. I'd get some sleep... So, Doc Powers cleared you for Sunday.
64) 0) text: Tony and Cap walk around the edges of a man-made lake facing the house. During the dialogue, they approach a veranda area.
64) 1) dialog: Papers got us as six point dogs, you believe that? I can't wait to strap it on and stick it to Dallas like we used to. Show ‘em what this game is all about. Right there in the playoffs! (CONTINUED)
64) 5) dialog: You okay?
64) 7) dialog: (suddenly) The Doc got it wrong about your back?!
64) 9) dialog: We all play hurt, Cap. You just need the needle.
64) 11) dialog: I seen you in practice, Cap. You're ready now. What is it?
65) 0) text: Cap doesn't respond or look at him. He sits on a swing. Tony is stunned as the realization hits him.
65) 1) dialog: Cap, you don't want to go in? What is it?
65) 7) dialog: «+. You didn't get any phone calls I didn't know about did you?... from Christy? (as Cap shakes his head) «+. You seeing a psychiatrist or something?
65) 9) dialog: Then where the hell is this coming from, Rock? (vaising his voice) You wanted to play. I fought for you! Why didn't you tell me something, do you realize what I...
65) 11) dialog: «+. I went out on a long limb for you, man! I took on Christina. And Willie. And the media. And you do this to me?!? I had four weeks, I woulda gone another way... Rooney swinging back and forth, proceeds with great difficulty:
65) 16) dialog: The things you're saying are in your head, Rock -- they're not real... You know you've got it in you, because I know you do!
65) 19) dialog: I need you, Rock -- to lead this team. The team needs you. I need you... Cap dries his eyes, looks at Tony hard.
65) 20) dialog: One last time. You and me. Together... Trust me.

69) 2) dialog: (snorts) Nothing! I been trying to come up with some plays that Willie can't possibly fuck up. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
69) 6) dialog: (as Crozier laughs, sits) Nick, I don't know what the hell to do? I've tried talking to him every way I know -- yelling at him, reasoning with him, inspiring him -- the whole bit.
69) 8) dialog: ‘Sensitive’? I don't know from ‘sensitive’! I only know one way to coach. Sooner or later they've got to start acting like men.
69) 10) dialog: All these fucking numbers -- he runs left 18 percent faster than he runs right. He plays better on odd numbered days. Next we're gonna calculate the angle of his dick! What're we here for, Nick? We're technicians! Unexpectedly, HEELS CLICK down the corridor, and Christina suddenly walks in, furious -- throws USA Today Sports across the desk.
69) 12) dialog: If you're talking about Rose, I'm gonna bar his ass from here to fucking... (CONTINUED)
69) 19) dialog: Cap's my starter, Christy.
69) 21) dialog: (vaising his voice) I'1l do you one better: in the off-season I'm gonna trade Willie!
69) 23) dialog: Yeah, it is. The kid can sella lot of T-shirts, Christy, but he is tearing this team apart!!
69) 25) dialog: I can't! Not with him.
69) 28) dialog: (cising instead, to the door) Sit down, Nick! You want the big chair, get used to it first...! Hey if you feel that way about it, Christy, I don't know what the hell I can do for you -- except take a leak. (CONTINUED)
69) 34) dialog: (stunned) For what?! Shoving that talking turd out of the way? A hundred G's!
69) 36) dialog: That'll be a cold day in hell, baby!
69) 39) dialog: (explodes ) You think you're gonna tell me what to do?! Your father never told me what to do! AND YOU'RE
69) 43) dialog: I bet you would, too! (CONTINUED)
69) 49) dialog: You know, I'm really sick and tired of you calling me an old asshole! Your father was no genius. He acted like he was. And he took a lot of credit for things he didn't do. But let me tell you something, he at least respected me and he respected the concept of the coach coaching and the owner owning. I can't even imagine what he'd think of you right now with this... ‘act’ you're putting on, but my hunch is he'd be ashamed!
69) 53) dialog: Ashamed!
69) 59) dialog: (deadly quiet) Well, this old asshole has a playoff game in two days. A game which Cap Rooney is going to start and finish. Both of you -- get out. Crozier stands, a glance to Christina. They go. Tony is alone.
71) 0) text: Christina sits at her father's desk, living in the past. We FLOAT PAST a large portrait of her father TO the living room, where we overhear the VOICES of Tony and Margaret.
72) 0) text: Tony consults with Margaret. The thick velvet drapes are always drawn tight here -- banishing the blazing Florida sun and permanently shrouding Margaret's elegant parlor in shadows... Today she burns with an oracular power.
72) 2) dialog: I'm losing the team, Maggie. I'm losing control. Everything in my life is about control. I lead men. I control men. (a pause) Did Art think I was past it?... Is that why he made Christina President? Did he think I couldn't win anymore? (CONTINUED)
72) 7) dialog: Do you care? (a silence) I need your help, Maggie. Christina is going to destroy this team.
72) 9) dialog: (bewildered) We can't let that happen. We owe that to Art.
72) 13) dialog: Stop it.
74) 0) text: A SONG plays through the house, ghost-like. Tony drinks whiskey, pausing, as he goes through his personal mementoes in his chest of drawers, the TV turned to:
74) 7) dialog: Aggggh! If I'd punched you, you'd be shitting out your teeth right now -- you vampire prick! He picks out Mandy's lipsticked telephone number on a piece of paper and, after a pause, tears it up.
77) 2) dialog: «+. Well, clearly the tension of the season got to me and I overreacted to an innocent question from a journalist we all know to be of the highest caliber... I only hope that one day I'll truly be able to show Jack Rose just how much I treasure his invaluable contribution to the sport of football. Thank you. (CONTINUED)
78) 27) dialog: I don't know what to say really. We got three minutes left till the biggest battle of our professional lives... It all comes down to today. We either heal as a team or we crumble, inch by inch, play by play -- until we're finished. We're in hell right now, gentlemen, believe me. We can sit here and get the shit kicked out of us, or we can fight our way back into the light; we can climb out of this anger and this doubt and this
78) 32) dialog: (pause) «+. I wish I could do it for you, but I can't. I'm too old. I look around at your faces and I see young men and I think I made every wrong choice a middle-aged old man can make -- my life is a long list of rookie mistakes. I pissed away all my money, chased off everyone that loved me... lately I can't even stand the face I see in the mirror. This team has never heard their Coach take it to such a personal level.
78) 33) dialog: «+. As we get older, some things are taken away... well, that's part of life, but you only learn that when you lose something. You find out that life is this game of inches! So's football. Because the margin for error in either game, football or life, is so small... so small, guys. One half-step too late or too early and you don't quite make it. One half-second too slow or too fast and you don't quite catch it ‘cause it's half a fingertip away. The inches we need are everywhere around us, they're in every break of the game, every minute, every second. Mandrake forgot that. He was grabbing for miles when he only needed inches. And on this team there are no shortcuts. There are no more Doctor Mandrakes. On this team we fight for that inch! We tear ourselves and everyone else around us to pieces for that inch! We claw with our fingernails for that inch ‘cause when you add up all those inches, that is what makes the fucking difference between winning and losing -- between living and dying... In any fight I can tell you this, it's the guy who's willing to die who's going to win that inch. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
78) 36) dialog: And I know if I'm gonna have any kind of life anymore, it's because I'm still willing to fight and die for that inch... (beat) That's what living is. (sweeps the team with a look) The six inches in front of your face. I can't make you do it. You have to look around -- look at the guy next to you -- look into his eyes -- and I think you'll see a guy you know will go that inch with you. You'll see a guy who'll sacrifice himself for this team because when it comes down to it, he knows you would do the same for him! That's a team, gentlemen!... And either we will heal now as a team -- or we will die as individuals...
78) 38) dialog: That's football, guys. (pause) That's all it is. (then) Now what are you going to do? Silence... The team, as if one mind, emits a roar of approval. The players hug and slap each other on the back. It is a joyous moment of sudden unification and affection, a savage release of tension. Julian jumps up onto a table, grabbing their attention.
78) 71) dialog: Awright, awright, no big deal. We still block and tackle. (to Rooney) Stick with the game plan, Cap. You set on the first series?
78) 73) dialog: Then bring it home, Rock! Rooney strides onto the field.
79) 16) dialog: Can you play?
79) 20) dialog: Can you play?
79) 22) dialog: Rock -- look at me -- can you play? Rooney looks at him. His face tells the story.
79) 23) dialog: You fought like a son-of-a-bitch out there, Rock... I will never forget this.
79) 26) dialog: This isn't about you and me anymore. You've got to lead them, Willie. When they look in your eyes, they gotta believe.
79) 29) dialog: (seething) You got no business here -- I told you not to come here!
79) 32) dialog: (as intense as he can get) Leave here before I lose my temper, Mrs. Pagniacci, do you hear me?!...
79) 34) dialog: NEVER -- NEVER -- talk that way in front of my players! Do you understand!... or I'll spank the living shit out of you, little girl!!
79) 37) dialog: GET OUT! GET OUT NOW! Before I... a chair. Willie enters tentatively...
79) 39) dialog: (quietly) Jesus Christ, Christy... What the hell happened to you...? exits, her dignity intact. (CONTINUED)
80) 0) text: Tony is talking fast to Willie as they move down the tunnel. The sound of the CROWD GROWING...
80) 1) dialog: .»-- Take control of the huddle, get ‘em in and out quick. Take advantage of the box while the speaker's hot.
80) 3) dialog: Keep an eye on the front four. Make them work sideline to sideline, they'll slow down, and when you see them, take a knee, lookin' for some air, they're losing it. Then you go right at ‘em. Control the line of scrimmage, and you're gonna control this game.
80) 5) dialog: Stats don't mean shit to me. Get me five yards on first, and they'1l have to worry about stopping both you and Julian. Possession of the ball -- that's all I want. Move those chains.
80) 7) dialog: Read the safety's drop, if he's flat footed or in his backpedal, we go downtown. Keep ‘em honest with your eyes. The longer you look them off, the tougher it is for them to make their break. Surprise 'em, make it sudden, Willie. (CONTINUED)
80) 11) dialog: What are you, Gary Cooper?
80) 13) dialog: Forget it. Remember, keep them off balance with the hard count. That will slow the pass rush and buy you more time. If you see their arms shaking and their asses up in the air, they're coming... Control the line of scrimmage, you're gonna control this game, Willie
80) 15) dialog: «+. And don't forget to look for the mismatches! (as Willie sighs; he repeats) Look for the mismatches. You'll find one... One more thing! (carefully) Right out of the gate, let it fly. Go 999, and shock the shit out of ‘em. He grins at a surprised Willie. As they now break from the tunnel, the ROAR of the Dallas crowd, and the excitement of the sportscaster's voices overwhelms all.
80) 27) dialog: (into headset) ... hey at least he ran the play I called!
80) 62) dialog: (to Willie) Branco's aching to nail ya. He's playing for the cameras. Go Split Left 90 Hitch, but if you think Branco's gonna bite, audible a fade right to 'Sandman.' (CONTINUED)
80) 66) dialog: If Branco bites.
80) 84) dialog: Maybe no one's told him yet.
80) 124) dialog: (deeply relieved) Oh, Shark! You stopped ‘em cold, baby! Godammit!
80) 135) dialog: He gave you the shot, Willie. Now take it. (as Willie nods) -+. It's your time. Willie runs out, the crowd going nuts!
80) 152) dialog: Do it! Do it!
80) 184) dialog: Smart move. How ya doing?
80) 186) dialog: You know, there's something important I gotta ask you...
80) 188) dialog: That day you came over to my house, I made dinner for you?
80) 190) dialog: Did you not like the jambalaya? Willie looks at him and laughs. (CONTINUED)
80) 197) dialog: (smiles) I thought that. Just go out and kick their ass and win the game!
80) 202) dialog: (to Crozier) Comanche.
80) 206) dialog: Let the kid do his thing!
80) 210) dialog: This is what coaching's all about, Nick. You up to it? Crozier breathes and relays the play to Cap, on to Willie
80) 237) dialog: (to Crozier, re: Willie's running) He's still holding onto that thing like a loaf of bread. Someone's gonna take it from him. (to Cap and QB coach; looking at Willie) ... Is he okay?! (to Julian) Way to run! (to Cap and staff) He did it for once! He thought with his head, not his balls -- unselfish! Great move... let's go... four seconds. One time. I love this game!
80) 241) dialog: Take a breath...
80) 243) dialog: You set?
80) 245) dialog: Then make ‘em believe, Willie. This time. Now. (CONTINUED)
81) 4) dialog: You sure?
81) 8) dialog: I'm sorry I put you in, Cap.
81) 13) dialog: Thanks.
81) 15) dialog: He's okay. He'll be leaving after the season... So will I...
81) 17) dialog: It was. It was beautiful. (CONTINUED)

82) 0) text: Tony walks out onto the field where Willie stands alone, a football in hand, watching as the groundskeepers unroll the large tarps and stadium personnel pick through the stands. The stars are abundant this night.
82) 1) dialog: Nice night. They walk together across the field.
82) 3) dialog: Glad to see success hasn't gone to your head too much, kid...
82) 5) dialog: Don't pat the ball.
82) 7) dialog: Don't pat the ball before you throw, it's getting to be a habit, and they're seeing it too easy... (as Willie looks at the ball he is holding) This is your moment, Willie. Savor it. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
82) 10) dialog: (beat) But never forget: on any given Sunday, you're either gonna win or you're gonna lose. The point is...
82) 13) dialog: Next year I'm out of here.
82) 15) dialog: I'm not the right guy for this team anymore. JI wanna see my grandkids. I wanna start living again... I wanna wait on a grocery line. I wanna walk on a sidewalk. I wanna do nothing... As long as it's not fishing...
82) 17) dialog: «+. There was this great quarterback in the '70s I knew. This guy was one tough sonofabitch. Fought for every inch he got. Didn't have your natural skill, this guy, but he made it happen, he won... So time went by and he didn't know it, but his day was over. He couldn't go deep like he used to and he started missing the easy underneath routes... the game was just passing him by... Anyway, I ran into him a few weeks ago in L.A. and we had a few beers, we started talking and you know what he said? (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
82) 20) dialog: He said that when looked back at those 200 whatever-they-were Sundays, he didn't really miss the Pantheon Cups or the girls or the money or even the goddamned glory! What he missed were those other guys looking back at him in the huddle. Those eleven guys -- their names he could hardly remember -- but it was their faces he remembered... every one of ‘em seeing things the same way. Looking downfield. Together. (beat) That's what he missed... I'll miss you, amigo. Tony pats Willie affectionately on the arm and walks off. Willie's expression is gentle, appreciative. He drops back three quick, lithe steps, and sails a long, perfect spiral down the empty field.
83) 2) dialog: (as if in response to Willie) .+. Hey, we're all scared. If you think any coach these days got himself a secure visa out of Casablanca, you need a Mandrake X-ray. (off laughter) I'm a triple-decker stress sandwich right now... (CONTINUED)
83) 6) dialog: (smiles) Not even close... try fishing, Johnny. He's responding off-handedly to a FEMALE REPORTER'S quest on the stairs leading up to the veranda of an Italian- style villa housing the Pagniacci Foundation. The group mills nervously; something's in the air.
83) 17) dialog: Thank you, Christy... I really am sorry I've not been able to deliver to you and the fans another Pantheon Cup. San Francisco sure took care of that for me... (off good-natured laughter) It's been way too long not to win the Big One. But in football, as in life, things change and fresh blood is needed... (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
83) 20) dialog: (beat) ++. So I guess it's time for me to get the hell outta the way. Bring in the new. I think Nick Crozier is gonna do a great job... (nods to Crozier) --- Most of all, I wanna thank the people of Miami for their long support over these last 20- something years... Geez, it flew by like... like any other Sunday, but it's meant everything to me and I've had a great ride. Too good a ride for any one man. I'm gonna miss you all. Thank you... There is significant, heartfelt applause from some, not all. Rose, in spite of himself, is regretful to see his nemesis depart, muttering to a colleague.
83) 22) dialog: .»+. I almost forgot... In thinking about change, I guess I felt it was time for me to change, too. Y'know, like an old vampire, I need a new blood supply... (some laughter) it was Willie Beamen who taught me how... to give it another shot. (as the press is murmuring, wondering) -+. So, starting today, I am taking over as Head Coach of that new expansion team in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the Aztecs. (as a wave of questions roll across the balcony) Why? ‘Cause they're giving me full management control. How can I pass that up? I guess the bigger I get, the more ridiculous! (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
83) 25) dialog: (off laughter) «+. But hoping not to make a fool out of myself out there, I have just signed Willie Beamen as starting Quarterback and ‘franchise player' for the Aztecs... is pandemonium on the veranda. Christina's Crozier looks like he's going to throw up. Tony grins. That's the way it goes. He waves and walks out -- leaving Christina and Crozier to deal with a bewildered and upset press corps.
84) 1) dialog: So, Miss P., I look forward to seeing you next year across those sidelines... and calling it what it always was and still is: a game. Let's keep it that way... So long, everybody. The same image that opened the story: A football field. Any football field. Grass sways in the wind.
