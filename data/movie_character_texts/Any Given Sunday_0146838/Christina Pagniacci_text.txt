0) 105) dialog: (into the red phone) Oh, Jesus! Vincent, get me the names of who's available out there in the quarterback market right away, would you?... and how ‘bout every available line coach -- Maybe somebody who can actually teach this line how to block!! A young woman raised to appreciate football, her outburst quiets the dozen people partying in the box. Her mother, MARGARET PAGNIACCI, an elegant older woman, who looks out of it, mostly quasi-drunk or drugged, though she does a superb job of concealing this with her fixed and dignified expression, inquires:
0) 107) dialog: (ignores her) «+. find out about Malloy. Why'd Denver cut him? Where is he?
0) 156) dialog: Soon as you know, you call! If this is serious, Harvey, I need to know yesterday, you understand what I'm saying?!
2) 49) dialog: I don't care if you have to chopper the guy in off his yacht, Harvey -- bring him out here right away! And get me the names of the top neurosurgeons in the country. I want the best!
2) 52) dialog: slams her hand down in frustration, sharing a 65 look with Ed Phillips. She is a strong, energetic executive in her late 20s, raised by her deceased father, founder Art Pagniacci, to be a son and gain the respect of a man's world, to the point of acquiring a "take no prisoners" attitude. She calls up to:
2) 55) dialog: Why?! Why is he calling these plays?... Nick? He's got to take a chance... Nick! Tell him!
2) 57) dialog: Make some noise.
2) 101) dialog: Can you believe this? A third- string quarterback... Who found him, Johnny?
2) 110) dialog: ..-. Van Ness?! Dominic, he's a hundred years old, for God's sake! Find me a quarterback who's under fifty, who's solid, been around and can get us to the playoffs... (pause) No, it looks like some surgery on his lower back, an L-5 I think, but there's a chance he can get back by the playoffs...
2) 160) dialog: Two hands, you showboat! Two goddamn hands -- you...
2) 163) dialog: (really pissed) Good night, Mother. (CONTINUED)

6) 0) text: Coach D'Amato enters to find Cap Rooney in bed, his lower back and legs supported, a morphine drip in one arm and an IV in the other, unnaturally white and swollen from the hits -- doing his stoic best to abide the searing pain in his back. Flowers fill the crevices of the room. He's on a speaker phone with the boss, Christina -- while Cindy, his concerned and devoted wife, acknowledges Tony with a head nod.
6) 3) dialog: Cindy, look, stop worrying about this! The important thing is this thing, this... microdisectomy, went well, it's under control. We'll make a strong statement in the morning, okay?... Cap? (as Cap acknowledges) I've been researching vertebrae. And guess what? -- There's a great doctor in Minnesota. Rosen. A specialist in rehab. I'm gonna fly him out tomorrow. I found out two important things... Cap?
6) 5) dialog: One -- you can live without the L-5 disc, and two...
6) 9) dialog: .+. And two, it all depends on you. We got the bye week. You could be ready as early as San Francisco.
6) 11) dialog: I want you to rest up for tonight and we'll talk tomorrow, okay. Night, Cap... Cindy. She hangs up. Cindy disconnects the call.
12) 3) dialog: «+. you're sure? No public bond issues -- no extra tax assessments?
12) 7) dialog: (excited) So let me get this straight: the Governor of California's saying there's nothing for the public to vote on, right?
12) 10) dialog: +. he gives us the full concession, parking, signage, sponsorship money?
12) 12) dialog: (amazed) My God, L.A. is a dream! You realize they're giving us the world, Ed?!
12) 14) dialog: Oh, Ed! It's more than that... (pause, seeing Tony's car pull up) I just don't trust Smalls backing this stadium bond. Dad always said he was a thief in a tuxedo... She glances at a picture on her desk of her late father. Beneath it in the silver frame she has had engraved: "Whatever It Takes." (CONTINUED)
12) 20) dialog: We don't really, Ed, we can...!
12) 26) dialog: The Association will listen to reason. L.A. is an entertainment empire! It can easily handle two teams. Here, what? The wrong fan base. No Hispanic players, no Hispanic fans... (off silence) Ed, if ever you owed Dad a favor, make it this one! This team will be born again in L.A.!
12) 28) dialog: (thinking about it) $250 million?... It's so low. (CONTINUED)
12) 35) dialog: I still like this business. Let's keep this quiet for now, Ed, can we?
13) 1) dialog: Come in... Morning, Tony.
13) 4) dialog: Alka-Seltzer?
13) 6) dialog: ... Hell of a loss, we were so goddamn close. (CONTINUED )
13) 12) dialog: You know, I can see why my mother somehow got herself into a drunken stupor watching football games all her life... but this kind of play makes you want to jump out the fucking window!
13) 14) dialog: (overlapping) ‘You either gonna win or you gonna lose. The point is can you win or lose like a man?' Dad said a lot of catchy things.
13) 16) dialog: But he never could stand losing, could he! (as Julian fumbles again) «+. But J. just couldn't resist going for his bonus yards?
13) 18) dialog: +. I know it was, Tony -- but I'll tell you this -- Julian wasn't thinking about you, he was thinking about the extra million dollars he gets when he hits 1500 yards... (glancing at Ed) Which, by the way, definitely helps blow out our fucking salary cap for next year... (CONTINUED )
13) 23) dialog: «+. which is why I'd like you to sit him out -- then maybe he'll get his head into the game. And save us some dollars in the bargain.
13) 25) dialog: Sarcasm is not a solution. Four in a row, Tony. They want your head. Without Cap, it's gonna take a miracle to make the playoffs.
13) 27) dialog: I'm not 'panicking' -- but no surgeon I know in the country is saying Cap'll be back by playoff time -- even with the bye week...
13) 34) dialog: (wearying of Tony) «+. the economics just don't work -- the fact is this season is a disaster, a write-off. It's over! Now Tony's headache is getting worse.
13) 38) dialog: Dad used to say, 'No intensity, no victory.' Where the hell is your intensity, Tony!? We were always in the playoffs. Four years ago the only thing we worried about was winning a third Pantheon Cop! Now what? We're a second-tier team, Tony, that's what! (as he objects) .-. No, admit it! You're not being honest, we're the fifth, sixth team in this league. We just don't get the respect anymore. For chrissake, Tony, just four years ago we won the Pantheon Cup! Do you remember! We beat the pants off Massachusetts! Dad would be shocked to see this mess we created...
13) 46) dialog: (pissed) Running game!? Okay -- you always talk about a running game. But who cares as long as you win! People want to watch passes, touchdowns, high scores! That's the game now, Tony!... We paid a lot of money to get Nick Crozier here from Minnesota specifically to modernize this offense. But when I look down at the field I don't see any new play calling, I don't see him doing what he does best. And frankly, what is most disturbing, is I don't see you even listening to his calls from the booth...
13) 48) dialog: (bristles) So you know everything about everything, right, Tony? Another silence. Ed coughs. Christina regrets the atmosphere, throws up her hands and paces.
13) 50) dialog: (in a yielding tone) Ed, stay... (to Tony) You gripe about Julian Washington but you completely ignore the problems with Cap and Shark? I don't get it. (CONTINUED )
13) 54) dialog: Think about the future. Do you know what we could get for Cap right now? Probably a first anda third draft choice. He's still got an arm, and people respect him. We know he's finished but if we're smart, we can...
13) 58) dialog: Excuse me -- Cap and Shark were great, but memories don't pass and tackle like they used to...
13) 61) dialog: ... And we can say good-bye to both of them with dignity! With class! We'll give ‘em positions in the front office, retire their numbers. A going-away day that...
13) 70) dialog: Tony, I am not re-signing a seven- million-dollar-a-year, 39-year- old quarterback no matter how big he was. (pointing to a stack of budget sheets on her desk) I crunch those numbers every month till my fingers bleed. We make less money than 90 percent of the other teams. The economics simply don't make any sense!
13) 72) dialog: (equally intense) «+. Because you were a fighter then! You had intensity, Tony! But today he'd cut your ass! Because that's just the way the game is now. I love this team as much -- if not more -- than you. I was born into this goddamn business, so don't try to make me out to be some heartless bitch in a skybox bleeding my players dry...
13) 77) dialog: (drawing up) The point is... as much as I respect... my famous ‘Uncle Tony' -- the team's just not responding to you, and I'll be damned if I'm going to let everything my father fought for slide down the drain with you at the helm. I will do anything -- you hear me, anything -- to bring this team back to greatness!
13) 80) dialog: (after him) Who's playing the child now, Tony? Do I have to remind you of what kind of ground you're on? Everybody's got to negotiate... you too.
13) 82) dialog: +. You know, you're not offering me a whole lot right now, Tony... ‘Whatever it takes.' I'm just doing it the way he did it.
13) 84) dialog: I don't drink beer, Tony.
14) 82) dialog: (to Ed, genuinely puzzled) Where's this kid been all this time? In D'Amato's doghouse?

19) 3) dialog: Cap, say hello to his Honor.
19) 6) dialog: Who?
19) 10) dialog: Oh, of course. (sweetly) Cap, do you think you could find him...? Thanks. Cindy, you look beautiful. Cap and Cindy share a look of disappointment as they go.

25) 9) dialog: (cryptic, to Crozier) You won't...! I promise.
27) 0) text: Christina is at last alone with the slightly-inebriated Mayor.
27) 1) dialog: Why have you been ducking me?
27) 3) dialog: Cut the crap, Tyrone.
27) 5) dialog: «+. I want the 250 million you promised me... (he looks like a sphinx) You know I can get the rest with the bond. You said you'd give me 100 percent support and now you're getting cold feet just because...
27) 7) dialog: I already told you -- we'll split revenue on the club seats, the corporate boxes, all the concessions, the stadium-naming rights, and the increase in ticket sales. There'll be 10,000 new parking spaces. And we'll be pulling in almost 40 million in personal seat licenses over ten years... The concept of a new stadium, T.J., funds the whole deal. Without it, no...
27) 12) dialog: (patiently) .-. All the fans really care about, Tyrone, is winning. And if I don't have the money I need to stay competitive, then this team is finished! That's the bottom line!
27) 14) dialog: I'm not asking you to vote, T.J. I'm asking you to deliver! We've been backing you since Dad's time, getting your people passes and money they never dreamed of. We were there for you, and... (delicate) .».. and if you're not there for us, T.J., I'm telling you this... we'd seriously consider leaving this town.
27) 17) dialog: (sure of herself) Oh, there's 'loopholes,' Tyrone. Like the goddamn stadium is falling apart, you know -- you haven't contributed one fucking penny to maintenance on that relic! I remodeled the practice facility out of my own pocket. I... (CONTINUED)
27) 23) dialog: (resisting) -.. We're a pro team, T.J., and we're playing in a college stadium built in the '30s, and we're losin' a ton of fucking money. When are you...
27) 25) dialog: Tyrone, I'm telling you again -- time is running out and you are playing with fire.
27) 27) dialog: (grins back) Then we'll see how you like it. She leaves, pissed. It looks like L.A. for sure.
30) 3) dialog: Hi, Tony... We better get going, Mom. It's getting late. Margaret rises, handing the ring to D'Amato.
30) 7) dialog: ... I remember when my dad designed that... (an awkward silence) I guess I'll have to wear mine on a chain around my neck, huh?
30) 9) dialog: I was just trying to --
35) 44) dialog: (at her charming best) Willie, congratulations, you were great! Really exciting to watch out there!! (CONTINUED)
35) 49) dialog: Two in a row! ‘Whatever it takes' -- right. You make me excited about the future again... Others look on at the two of them. Willie, in his jockstrap, is coming on to Christina ina cheeky, street way, showing off his muscles. Christina, accustomed to locker rooms and not seeing her players in any way as he doesn't competitive with her husband, ignores the fact add one stitch of clothing to his jock. Willie senses this gulf and will come to resent it as another synecdoche for the owner/player class structure.
35) 51) dialog: (a little surprised) .-. I'm flattered, Willie, I really am, but I'm married. I've just never dated players. It gives the wrong impression.
35) 53) dialog: I think we all are, in business, Willie... So, come by tomorrow and we'll talk. I think you'll like what you're gonna hear... okay? (smiles, corrects his punctuation) Pagniacci. She exits. Her eyes catching Tony, on the fly, through a cubicle window -- huddled with Rooney, Crozier, and Julian in the cramped visiting coach's office. 122.

40) 7) dialog: (moves on) What about Shark?
40) 11) dialog: Can you clear him?
40) 13) dialog: How come Dallas had their quarterback practically in a coma last month just before he played one of the greatest games of his life...?
40) 16) dialog: I'm not looking to screw him, Harvey. But I gotta have him in the playoffs -- and he wants to play for chrissake, so everyone comes out...
40) 21) dialog: (a beat, eye to eye) I'm thinking we'll probably cut him in the off-season. The word's already out there, everyone's seen him take the hits. No one's gonna take him at his price... I think he'll be happy just to have his old job back at 30 percent of what he makes. That's if we want him back. (off Mandrake's waiting look) Dad always used to say, 'To make money, you got to spend money.' You do the math, Doctor. What you help save us we won't forget at contract time.
40) 23) dialog: (exiting) Tell him what he needs to know. Shark can play. Cap can't.
69) 11) dialog: Congratulations! Was I the last to know? My own team?
69) 17) dialog: We'll see about that! I'm talking about Willie! What the hell are you doing startin' Rooney? He hasn't played in six weeks and you're going to throw him into the playoffs against the best pass rush in the league?!
69) 20) dialog: And if we lose this game because...
69) 22) dialog: (stunned) You what?! That is not your option!
69) 24) dialog: Then you hold it together.
69) 26) dialog: Then I'd say we have another problem!
69) 33) dialog: Will you stop this... posturing! Where are you going? I'm not finished. The Commissioner just called me. (as Tony stops) He's gonna fine you a 100 grand...
69) 35) dialog: .-. And he wants a public apology from you to Jack Rose!
69) 37) dialog: You will apologize, Tony. The days when ‘Uncle Tony' could just do what he wants -- calling all the shots, firing Mandrake when he wants, smacking sportswriters -- those days are over! You start Willie on Sunday and you make the adjustment to modern times -- or you're out, Tony! And that's...
69) 41) dialog: (not backing down) Will you stop using my father as a scapegoat! Do you think you don't have to deal with me by raising my father all the time? When are you going to listen to me! 'Cause I'll tell you this right now -- I'd cut my father's ass if we were losing like this!
69) 48) dialog: «+. And you know what? I wouldn't lose a night's sleep over it. ‘Cause like you he was sentimental. And I can't afford to be. I'm in the business of holding this team together. That means selling! Selling tickets, skyboxes, players. Selling. That's why Willie works for me. He sells tickets. And that's why he's starting Sunday.
69) 52) dialog: (in a danger zone) Here we go again! You don't listen, do you --
69) 54) dialog: Why the hell do you think he left me in charge, you bullheaded moron?! He could've made you General Manager -- but he didn't, did he?! Why? Because he knew you didn't have the guts to do it without him when he was gone alright! He told me so himself. Right there on his deathbed. That's why, Tony -- because he didn't trust you anymore. Because you got old! These words cut Tony hard. He puts on his game face. (CONTINUED)

79) 33) dialog: I_don't care what your problem with him is -- alright!? Cap Rooney is over! You're the only one that's failed to see... Outside, the players listen silently. He throws A pause. Christina
79) 35) dialog: (scared) Don't talk to me like that! It's MY team too! And I don't give a fuck if Willie's changing the plays! You let your ego get in the way of this team, and it is going to cost us the game!
79) 42) dialog: (nods to Willie) Good...! Prove ‘em wrong, Willie... She crosses to the main locker room, her entourage following.

80) 42) dialog: (following him, unsatisfied) Phil, I'd really like to... They're out of earshot at the door. The Commissioner, obviously under some pressure of his own, decides to tell her now.
80) 44) dialog: (surprised) Oh? About what, sir?
80) 46) dialog: (stunned) Who! Who said this? Who's been saying this...! She checks herself.

81) 14) dialog: How's Cap?
81) 16) dialog: (nods ) I'm sorry it ended up this way, Tony, I know you don't believe it but I really am... Seeing the team out there today -- it was like going back in time... (remembering) God, it was beautiful football!

83) 8) dialog: stands before the assembled press corps -- Coach D'Amato moving to her side on cue. Nick Crozier sits close by. Margaret Pagniacci and the Mayor attend.
83) 9) dialog: (reading) Thank you all for coming today... I guess you've heard all the rumors about the Sharks leaving for Los Angeles because Mayor Smalls was reportedly unable to get City Council approval for stadium improvements... (as Smalls tightens) -+. but let me make this as clear as I can to you: We -- the Sharks -- have no intention of leaving Miami. We love this town, and we love our Shark Stadium -- and we will continue to remodel it, at whatever cost, to make it a home away from home for our fans! (looking pointedly at the Mayor) And we have great confidence at the final hour that our Mayor will be there for us...
83) 15) dialog: --- You know, I came to a revelation recently. I realized how much I love this game, and I want to live up to what my father left me: a legacy, a feeling that this is our house -- the Pagniacci house... I am resolved therefore to stick it out here in Miami because the Pagniaccis are not quitters and we will never let this town down! As they applaud, Christina turns to Margaret. United behind the family name, they seem to have discovered each other again.
83) 16) dialog: Nick...? (sees Nick standing) Nick Crozier -- our new Head Coach. Welcome! (as Crozier nods in response to the polite applause) Tony D! Thank you!... Always! Wherever you go, know this: you will always be a 'Shark' in your heart. You will always be remembered with great respect and love. ‘Whatever it takes,' right?... And Tony...? Thanks for making me understand what I'd forgotten -- that football is more than a game. It's a way of life! Tony D'Amato, everybody, give him a hand! She hugs Tony as he steps to the podium.
