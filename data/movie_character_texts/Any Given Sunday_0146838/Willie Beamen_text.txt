In the backfield, the taunting defensive end slaps Willie's helmet hard as the whistle blows. Willie barely has time to breathe before he hears "the voice of God" in his helmet speaker:

He is slammed hard after a big 32- yard gain to the Chicago 43 yard line; the crowd roars with lusty approval. Julian Washington eyes Willie wearily as he bounces up. Is this kid going to be another runner in his backfield?
14) 32) dialog: Set, Green 68, Green 68, go! Julian rushes forward left of Willie for the hand-off -- but Willie doesn't give him the ball -- Julian breaks for a confused micro-moment, then throws himself forward into the pile -- as Willie races right, as if to run, then loops a high, curving pass to the second wide-out in the end zone. Touchdown!
14) 38) dialog: Bootleg.

Sanderson races for the left corner -- Willie not taking his eyes off him, he pump fakes the ball to him -- but once the Chicago defense commits to his sleight of hand, Willie bootlegs it towards the right end zone. Two defensive backs reverse and run right at him. It's going to be a race to the wire. (CONTINUED)

41) 59) text: Willie says nothing. Tony takes
41) 61) dialog: You know, I look at all these pictures and trophies and stuff and it just makes me... sad. Like the room is full of ghosts. When I'm done with the game, or the game is done with me, I don't wanna be no ghost up on a wall. I want more'n that. a long moment.
41) 63) dialog: (long icy pause) Yeah, I figgered. That's why I'm here, right? I knew you was gonna sell me out.
41) 65) dialog: Bullshit! He's not half the athlete I am! Look me in the eye, Coach, and tell me Cap's the better player...
41) 71) dialog: (derisively) Sure! I guess that was another guy winning the last two games. I put points on the board! He lost four in a row. I lead by doing!
41) 74) dialog: And I deserve the bench, right?!
41) 76) dialog: And his time is over! And yours is too... ‘less you start taking some risks! Start playing the game the way it is now. It ain't all those pictures on the wall anymore --

41) 90) dialog: Broke 'em?! How'd I break ‘em?
41) 92) dialog: Man, I lost a million-dollar signing bonus ‘cause a booster gave me a three-hundred-dollar suit to go to his kid's wedding. I didn't even know the guy. Hell, everybody was getting something! How's a black man supposed to get through college when he don't got the money to get clothes, go on a date? They all had their hands out but it was me they suspended. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
41) 97) dialog: I dropped six rounds in the draft ‘cause of that. And the coaches rapping me ‘troublemaker,’ ‘arrogant, ' ‘won't play ball,' all that corporate shit they hit the brothers with when they won't kiss the money. Shit, I coulda made millions of dollars if I'd kissed that big ass Julian's kissing all the time. You talk about 'sacrifice'? I sacrificed about ten million dollars is what I sacrificed, ‘cause of those dumb rednecks like your coach friend at San Diego who makes me corner back ‘cause I got fast feet! It was him separated my shoulder, fucked up my throwin' arm tackling some 250-pound bullmother. I was a great football player but nobody gave me the time of day or the season I needed to heal that shoulder. They traded me right outta there!
41) 100) dialog: (challenged) Fear?! Who you talking to?! I hung in there when nobody gave a shit about me. I rode the bench for five fucking years! And now I get my one lousy shot, I'm 26 years old -- half my football life is over -- and now you tell me ‘You go on back to the bench, son. ‘Cause you gotta sacrifice for the greater glory of Cap Rooney.’ Well, fuck you, Coach! I'm not buying that brand, ‘cause you're some scared old man who won't let me play my way ‘cause I might just win! And then what the fuck was your life all about?! Tony fights to control himself. Outside, the evening crawls through the twilight. (CONTINUED)
41) 107) dialog: (caustic, overlapping) Yeah, I'm the leader of your team till Cap's back up! Then I'm back on the bench. Shit, you ain't said two words to me all season ‘til Cherubini went down -- then it was...
41) 108) text: (imitating D'Amato) ‘Son, just pretend you're throwing a pass on the street in the ‘hood and your mama's ringing the dinner bell' -- all you done is talked at me, man, never listened to a goddamned thing I said!

All I see of this team is a bunch of rich superfly brothers tripping in this white man's world, driving their BMW, getting their dicks sucked by 100 dollar hair jobs... and the clock's running and no one's giving a shit ‘cause they're all dying inside... You were a great athlete, J, but you become a_joke! You're playing, but it's like you're dying inside.

51) 49) dialog: That's my little nickname. Don't mean no disrespect to the man, but to me it's all about winning. That's what this country's all about. Being number one. Every kid can grow up to be President, right? Who the hell wants to grow up to be Vice-President? There ain't no number two in football. You tell me who lost the Pantheon Cup last year? You tell me who came in second in the 100 at the Olympics? Where I come from you're number one or you ain't shit (bleeped)! This country was built on kicking immigrant ass. African ass, Chinese ass -- don't- Matter-who ass. Only reason I made it out of Dallas is I wanted it more than the other guy. There ain't no grey area!
