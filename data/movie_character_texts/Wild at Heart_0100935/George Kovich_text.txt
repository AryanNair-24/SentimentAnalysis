56) 5) dialog: My nameВ’s George Kovich.  Bet youВ’ve heard of me.
56) 7) dialog: Was in all the papers three years ago. IВ’m seventy-six, was only seventy- three then.  Had a business in Buffalo, New York, called Rats With Wings.  Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted В’em killed.
56) 9) dialog: No, maВ’am.  I was a housepainter,  in the union forty-one years.  IВ’m retired now, livinВ’ with my sister,  Ida.  Ida moved down here twenty-five years ago, married an oil man named Smoltz, Ed Smoltz.  HeВ’s dead now, so itВ’s just me and Ida.  I sold my house and moved down after the city of Buffalo put me out of business. Hell, RWW was doinВ’ them a service, and they charged me with endangerinВ’ the public.
56) 11) dialog: TheyВ’re useless pests.  IВ’ve shot hundreds of В’em...
56) 14) dialog: (voice-over)
56) 17) dialog: ...Neighbors asked me how come the spotted bastards didnВ’t light on my house or my brother EarlВ’s anymore, and I told В’em the truth.  I shot В’em...  EarlВ’s gone now...
56) 19) dialog: (voice-over)
56) 22) dialog: SheВ’s stone deaf but the racket the pigeons made drove Earl crazy.  He could hear В’em even with the TV on. He owned a bar thirty years, The Boilermaker, on Wyoming Street.   EarlВ’s roof was a favorite spot for pigeons.  They lit there day and night. I wanted to toss a grenade up there.
56) 24) dialog: Woman drivinВ’ down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle.  She called the police and they came over and arrested me.  Thought I was a sniper!  Boys at the VFW loved that one.  Cops didnВ’t understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property.  I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger.  I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebodyВ’s cat  would eat it.  Hell, I had six cats myself.  So I used the .22 because it didnВ’t make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
56) 26) dialog: Guilty on a reduced charge.  Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place.  You seen it.  Plain filth. Kovich stands up and puts some money on the counter.
56) 27) dialog: ItВ’s a serious situation.  Not like the Turks and the Armenians, maybe, or the Arabs and the Jews, but I want people to remember me and what IВ’ve done and pick up where I left off.  Somebody had to make a move. It was nice meetinВ’ you folks. George Kovich nods and leaves.
