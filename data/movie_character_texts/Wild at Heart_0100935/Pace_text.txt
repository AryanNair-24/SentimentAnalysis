IВ’m gonna name it Pace no matter if itВ’ boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, donВ’t it?  ItВ’ kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old  when you get out. I feel like IВ’m kind of in prison too, but I know in six months, itВ’ll be over and IВ’ll have a son or daughter t show for it.  Our child!! I love you Sailor.  I donВ’t know how much or what it  means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know youВ’re thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever called me that. Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyВ’re spending it like there is no tomorrow.  IВ’m going to move out as soon as I can. Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyВ’re lookinВ at the two of us in a different light - whatever that means. Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you. Time donВ’t really fly honey does it? Love, your Lula P.S. I miss dancing...

What about a middle name if it is a boy after my  granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound so bad do you think? This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee.  Not pretty at all.  There are boys inside these walls meaner than Peru you can bet.  There is a Death House.  I am getting along.  The only thing is not thinking about the future. I miss dancing with you, too.  I love you.  It is hard to end this letter.  If I stop writing youВ’re gone.  There is not a lot more to say though. Vava con dios mi amor. Sailor
