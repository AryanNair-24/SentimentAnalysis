IВ’m gonna name it Pace no matter if itВ’ boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, donВ’t it?  ItВ’ kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old  when you get out. I feel like IВ’m kind of in prison too, but I know in six months, itВ’ll be over and IВ’ll have a son or daughter t show for it.  Our child!! I love you Sailor.  I donВ’t know how much or what it  means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know youВ’re thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever called me that. Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyВ’re spending it like there is no tomorrow.  IВ’m going to move out as soon as I can. Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyВ’re lookinВ at the two of us in a different light - whatever that means. Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you. Time donВ’t really fly honey does it? Love, your Lula P.S. I miss dancing...
