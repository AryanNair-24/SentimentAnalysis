92) 6) dialog: (quietly, but with iron authority) You'll lead the others to the wall as I tell you. Now. Torquil bows to Colwyn's authority; he leads the others toward the wall. Colwyn pulls off his hauberk, useless in this battle, and faces the Beast in his tunic. The wind whips the thin cloth as he advances across the ice to whe the Beast waits, obscured by the thickly falling snow. Suddenly, a gigantic chunk of ice flies straight at him. raises his hand and the ice shatters, streaking past him harmlessly. Now he begins to concentrate, focusing his power until hi body gleams - then shimmers - then bursts into flame with tongues of white fire leaping from his body as if it had been doused in gasoline. The flame is under his power; it doesn't harm him, nor does it melt the snow he walks on. only harms when he wills it - as when he sees a patch of Dark Ones approaching from the side. He sweeps his arm toward them and an arc of flames rolls across the ice lik wave, washing over them and leaving their charred bodies writhing in the snow. The Beast is moving back and forth in an area of ice ridg and hummocks, dimly visible through the heavy snowfall. N it is a stone tower, some fifty feet high.

As the Beast sidesteps, the flaming arc slices off the top of an ice hummock, leaving the flat surface boiling and steaming from the heat. Colwyn presses forward, driven by grief and rage. He launches a second arc of flame, one end of which catches Beast's side. The Beast roars with pain and retreats, dri back by Colwyn's power. He launches a third arc, and this one strikes the Beast's head, staggering it. The Beast is wounded now: one of its huge eyes is swollen half shut, the skin around it badly charred. Enraged, the Beast counterattacks. Huge projectiles streak toward Colw first come blocks of ice, then great fragments of stone. Finally, the stone fragments begin to burn, screaming through the air like meteors. The projectiles shatter against Colwyn's protective shiel of flame, but the force of repeated impact drives him backward. Small fragments of ice and stone actually pierc the shield, tearing his tunic, cutting his skin. He is bleeding from several flesh wounds and his forehead is burned by a fragment of flaming rock. But the Beast's power is not infinite. The hail of projectiles slows, then stops. Colwyn resumes his advance He chops his arm downward: we hear a sharp crack and an i hummock EXPLODES near the Beast. He chops again and an ic ridge EXPLODES, leaving a deep crack in the ice. The Beas hurls another projectile, but Colwyn brushes it aside as it were a mosquito and sweeps an arc of flame at the Beas to back it off. Then he resumes chopping with his arm: crack followed closely on crack as the ice around the Beast is sliced an shattered by Colwyn's power. The section of ice on which Beast stands suddenly drops a foot or so. The Beast hurls final projectile, then Colwyn cracks the ice again. We he a deep RUMBLE and a huge section of ice collapses, fallin into the depths of the Fortress, carrying the Beast with Watching from a distance, Torquil sees the exhausted Colw staggering on the ice, barely able to stand.
