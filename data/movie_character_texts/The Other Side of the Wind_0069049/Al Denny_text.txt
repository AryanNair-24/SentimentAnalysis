0) 41) text: Jammed into the back are the two cinema historians And biographers, HIGGAM and PISTER, also a DOCUMENTARY CREW (sound and camera)... They can see J.J. HANNAFORD in the driver’s mirror; he’s wearing sunglasses... Sitting beside him is his comrade and disciple, the highl successful young film director BROOKS OTTERLAKE. (OTTER- LAKE is also a talented and compulsive impressionist. With JAKE particularly -- with whom he is now, secretly, more than a bit uneasy -- he tends to jump from one “Voic to another.) Another CAMERAMAN IS SQUEEZED next to him. In the back seat: A flurry of hushed haggling between HIGGAM and PISTER, an a perfect frenzy of interviews... PISTER wants to know, among other things, if MR. HANNAFORD considers that “the camera is a phallus?” Maybe JAKE doesn’t hear... 20

0) 481) text: The door to this (part-time) projection room is important: when people open it, their silhouettes move across the screen. THE ACTRESS is the first to make such an entrance and, as she finds herself a place, is the cause of interested attention... Later there’s another interruption: the opening door (the square of light blanking out part of the screen -- the crouching and ducking silhouettes as new arrivals sneak heavily into the room). This time it’s JULIE RICH with a couple of journalist colleagues. They make a dash for it into the darkest corner of the room. Here, there aren’t any chairs, but the view of the screen in unimpeded, so they sit on the floor. ROGER and DENISE KLEE (a film-making partnership) are squatting nearby, their backs to the wall. Soon others in the room become aware of a low and rather venomous buzzing from the corner.

And they all seem so... surprised. Poor sods -- they look at you as though there was something you could do about it...
