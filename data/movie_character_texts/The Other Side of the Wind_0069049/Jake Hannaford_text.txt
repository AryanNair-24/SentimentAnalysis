HANNAFORD in the driver’s mirror; he’s wearing sunglasses... Sitting beside him is his comrade and disciple, the highl successful young film director BROOKS OTTERLAKE. (OTTER- LAKE is also a talented and compulsive impressionist. With JAKE particularly -- with whom he is now, secretly, more than a bit uneasy -- he tends to jump from one “Voic to another.) Another CAMERAMAN IS SQUEEZED next to him. In the back seat: A flurry of hushed haggling between HIGGAM and PISTER, an a perfect frenzy of interviews... PISTER wants to know, among other things, if MR. HANNAFORD considers that “the camera is a phallus?” Maybe JAKE doesn’t hear... 20

0) 519) dialog: This is a flash-back... You just happen to notice somebody trying to drown himself. Some young pink nobody ever heard of. And how's this? After you dry him out, you try to get him interested in staying dry... Hell, you can recite that story backwards. And it’s lousy -- I can’t get him interested in anything. Everything’s a drag, man -- Be a movie actor? That just bores him to death... He doesn’t die, though; no, he’s cured of that. He merely kicks me rather sharply in the groin and walks away... though offering a toast. Speaking of suicides.

0) 587) dialog: (quietly) Let’s keep going. But nothing happens. In the shadows we can just make out JAKE as he turns an inquiring look in the direction of the projectionist. Then the door opens... But this time, no bright light is thrown on the screen. All lights, in fact, have been turned off, and what enters now through the door is an immense comic birthday cake -- a fabrication of film cans crowned with a perfect forest of kitchen candles. “Ohs!” And “ahs!” (rather campily) from the crowd... THE BARON is in charge of ceremonies (the gag is clearly his)... 111 Everyone gathers in a circle around the mass of candles, They are big kitchen candles, far too numerous to blow out in the traditional single puff. The buzz and chatter trails away into silence...

The voices of the TV people retreating as he leaves them behind: OTTO’S VOICE (the Cameraman; after a beat) We start again? FIONA’S VOICE (murderous ) You haven't been shooting? What about these other cameras? OTTO’S VOICE They’re on their own, of course. FIONA’S VOICE Well, who the hell gave them permission -- ? JAKE moves to OTTERLAKE, taking ["Broke” } the drink out of his hand...
0) 667) dialog: (after a beat) Who told you I was broke? 124
0) 669) dialog: He did, did he...? How about the roof over my head, Brooksie, how dos that grab you?

0) 698) dialog: (quietly) That's kept you busy -- just collecting school-teachers? 129 (BILLY hopes his rueful grin will signal a reminder to JAKE that he’s also been occupied with SIMON... But there’s no indication that this registers.)

0) 732) dialog: Could be it’s softening your brain, Uncle.
0) 734) dialog: Wasn’t very smart, y’know -- poor- mouthing like that in front of Otterlake. Know who he is, Billy?
0) 737) dialog: (to MATT) Tell him who he is, Uncle.
0) 739) dialog: And y'know what Billy told him? He told him we’re in trouble.
0) 741) dialog: (very patiently) When we talk poor to the rich, William, they jump to conclusions. They think we’re getting ready for a touch.
0) 743) dialog: That could have been the general idea -- Till Uncle Billy loused it up on us. 136 Poor BILLY turns away...
0) 749) dialog: Brooksie Otterlake’s a chum... (gently, friendly -- but with a delicate hint of severity) We don’t hustle our chums for dough, kid. We’re kinda strict about that. 137 A tiny silence...
0) 751) dialog: Yes, kid?
0) 753) dialog: (patting PISTER gently on the cheek) Always remember... that your heart is God’s little garden... He smiles at him and ambles off into the darkness...

0) 799) dialog: (over-lap) Publish and be damned, Doctor. Look -- they’ve run out of film -- you can speak off the record... This last is accompanied by a quick glance (almost a wink!) Into the lens of the second camera which is following... A brief silence -- 144 BURROUGHS is still flushed with the excitement of being the center of all this attention, but by now he’s feeling quite nervous about the particular turn this multi-media interview is taking. JAKE gives him his steady “man to man” look: (A good equivalent to the straight arm on the shoulder).
0) 801) dialog: (in a tone of the most perfect warmth and understanding) What happened to that teacher?
0) 803) dialog: (still gently, but closing the trap) Let him go? What about the police? 145
0) 805) dialog: Those young boys -- they weren't sick when he finished with ‘em? (hardening) That’s a prison offense, isn’t it -- How many minors do you have to corrupt?

0) 813) dialog: (with the Hannaford smile) Right!
0) 815) dialog: (straight into camera) Notice how careful he is not to refer to it as an “Oscar.” (back to BURROUGHS) Doctor, would you care for a dip?
0) 817) dialog: (turning away) A little more hootch should be helpful -- I’1l be right with you.
0) 819) dialog: (turning back) Here, Dr. Burroughs, in the sight of God; I won’t even peek.
0) 821) dialog: I suppose so. Prigs and queers. 148
0) 823) dialog: Now, now, Dr. Burroughs --
0) 832) dialog: I was conned, Mother, it was a fake --
0) 836) dialog: Finder keepers?
0) 838) dialog: Care? We’re free for a change, eh, Uncle Bill...? Now we’ll have some fun. BILLY smiles gratefully... MAGGIE is irritated:
0) 840) dialog: “Chinese,” Maggie -- No, and the kid wasn’t a suicide. He was... an actor. 151 He makes the last word sound obscene... ZARAH can’t help but notice that his eyes are glazed to avoid scrutiny, he steps behind a screen and finishes undressing...
0) 845) dialog: A monkey on my back -- He has stepped out from behind the screen (dressed now in a terry-cloth bath- robe)... ZARAH’s look has stopped him. That means a drug habit, in case you didn’t know, Mother... Sure -- something you gotta kick. And my foot was getting sore... 152
0) 847) dialog: Finish what? He’s all washed up, Mother --
0) 849) dialog: We'll finish it; eh, Maggie?
0) 853) dialog: (after another beat, unfocussed) What about her? JULIE RICH’S VOICE (0.S.) Yes, what about her? JULIE RICH comes into scene. Enter THE BARON... 153

0) 865) dialog: (looking at the pipe) He tells me where I can stick it?
0) 870) dialog: You couldn’t manage that -- It rather spoils the pattern, doesn’t it?
0) 875) dialog: Speaking of presents... JAKE has been rummaging in a drawer. He brings something out and, turning with it, is haulted again by MATT’s voice reading from ZIMMER'’s “birthday card”: 156
0) 879) dialog: (making an announcement ) Gentlemen -- and Ladies... The clot of cameras thickens quickly around him... We're presenting an award... To the other half of “The Other Side Of The Wind”... the better half. A glint of alcohol in his eye, he moves toward THE ACTRESS. A bone for Pocohontas... The crowd watches in uneasy silence (THE ACTRESS very cool)... He pauses for effect. His eyes move to THE ACTRESS. 157 JAKE (contd. ) A little curio we picked up somewhere -- A bit of our own palefaced craftsmanship: an Indian bone... The inscription goes back before all this was movie country. Just after the gold was found. The redskin population dropped pretty quickly then -- ten years and ninety thousand of ‘em just... disappeared. Well, in those good old days, our gallant honkey pioneers used to cut themselves some heads off Indian skulls and pickle the ears in whisky for souvenirs -- And on bones, like this one, they liked to write cute little jokes -- (reading the inscription) “I am off the reservation at last.” And so you are, my dear... He lays the bone down on a table next to her quite gently, and speaks quite lightly.
0) 890) dialog: Another birthday, kid. And what a party that was -- No movie buffs or bums, no spies or spooks. Just paid- up members of The Club.
0) 894) dialog: Yep.
0) 896) dialog: I just got that one shot at him, Brooksie, and I missed. 161
0) 899) dialog: No, he didn’t look too good in there.
0) 901) dialog: This is the one that hurts, Brooksie... (OTTERLAKE is so good at dead-panning a gag that we almost wonder if he does imagine the old man is proposing some sort of lunatic duel?) 162 JAKE looks up at him, as the young director rises abruptly to his feet. Silence...
0) 903) dialog: (cutting him off) This is the scene we both hoped that we'd never get to. And I don’t think it’s going to play. Not even for comedy. He raises the gun and sights along it, pointing out the window --. He pulls the trigger. It clicks. The gun is empty. He lowers it, and turns, faintly smiling to OTTERLAKE... A short silence... Then:
0) 905) dialog: How much longer have you got? OTTERLAKE tries to answer... JAKE gets up and leans the gun against the wall. Silence... Silence... 163 JAKE (contd. ) Hey -- remember when you first appeared on that location of mine up in Bolivia? What is it -- just three years ago?
0) 907) dialog: A raggedy-ass kid...
0) 909) dialog: Yeah?
0) 911) dialog: I know, kid; let me finish your line for you. It’s still only a distant hope... How’s that for dialogue? 164 He grins at him and moves into the bathroom.
0) 923) dialog: But you don’t want to.
0) 925) dialog: Don’t give up the ship, Davey...?
0) 927) dialog: Didn't I tell you -- ? This scene will never play... 166
0) 936) dialog: His eyes are on THE ACTRESS
0) 938) dialog: (after a beat) Me. A shot rings out, and the lantern nearest to JAKE shatters to pieces. 168
0) 940) dialog: (falling into the hammy style of their game) Otterlake -- we never should have issued firearms to the natives. Another shot! And another lantern breaks. The group is practically blacked out.
0) 991) text: JAKE has moved ahead; be seen climbing into brand-new sports car. 177 he can a beautiful, OTTERLAKE (contd. ) (in his own voice, to AL) I wonder if our leader has any idea who that belongs to --
0) 1066) text: 192 JAKE, in the sports car, sits watching the FILM... OTTERLAKE, standing not far away, turns to another car, as it pulls to a stop... Silence... The FILM continues...
0) 1068) dialog: What does “abjure” mean? You went to Harvard.
0) 1070) dialog: That’s a suggestion? 193
0) 1072) dialog: I gave up on the seventh grade.
0) 1074) dialog: (to the others) Mr. Otterfield wanted to be an actor -- Then he saw one of my movies -- We all read the interview...
0) 1076) dialog: Hang onto your own, baby -- just for once. A long silence...
0) 1079) dialog: You bet your sweet cheeks. 195
0) 1085) dialog: Hey, Beautiful... 196 The banal words of the greeting seem to carry the vibration of many years of affectionate repitition. JAKE (contd. ) Going so soon...? ZARAH doesn’t speak. Wasn’t much fun for you, was it...? --. Goddam midgets...
0) 1087) dialog: Just brought ‘em along for laughs, Mother.
0) 1089) dialog: Casting call... Some cockamamy notion that the Old Man oughta be a dwarf. In the movie... Don’t you think it’s better if we never see him? Her eyes have gone to the distant screen... For a moment we share her viewpoint: 197 Then --
0) 1093) dialog: Heard but not seen, huh? And for the sex department... work quickly and always in the dark. He realizes that this has fallen very flat... even before he’s aware that OTTERLAKE is standing at his side.
0) 1095) dialog: She doesn’t like you, kid: that’s why she gave the party. She doesn’t figure I get quite enough exposure from the younger generation just from you... But I do, you know. I get quite enough. A short, tense silence... Then OTTERLAKE turns and leaves... Silence again between these two... And now, in the FILM, the lamenting wind is conquered by the song of the OLD MAN... JAKE (contd. ) That's old Manolito. We found him together... In Spain, remember...? She goes on listening for just a while longer to the old gypsies’ song... Hey, beautiful, couldn’t we fix it to see each other just a little bit less seldom.
0) 1097) text: JAKE absorbs this for moment. Then she continues: 199
0) 1098) dialog: Thanks, Mother...
0) 1101) dialog: (still trying to keep it bright) She’s not too happy with us, either... Well -- she was pretty good in there with the gun. 200
0) 1103) dialog: (the faint, hopeful smile is still frozen on his face -- but no smile is in his voice) The preferred target, I guess, would have been me.
0) 1106) dialog: (ruefully) Don’t worry, even if she doesn’t know, she’1l tell us. (For just this moment, we’re encouraged to believe that the young lady critic has nothing to say... But we’re wrong)
0) 1122) text: (This is, in fact, the continuation of some talk between JAKE and VOGEL, the start which we heard early last night, and which had been recorded. ) JAKE'S VOICE (contd. ) They don’t grow old -- it’s just something they stumble over and fall into. And they all seem so... surprised. Poor sods -- they look at you as though there was something you could do about it... CALB goes searching... through the house and out onto the terrace by the pool... But JAKE’S VOICE grows fainter... (But there is someone else here) ...
0) 1143) text: JAKE'S car lurches to a stop... JOHN DALE'S figure -- unmistak- able in its raincoat and with the curly ash-blonde hair, is in the foreground... JAKE peers at him through the murky light... 208
0) 1144) dialog: Johnny -- ? No answer. Came to my party after all -- JOHN DALE’S VOICE I came to get my car, Hannaford.
0) 1145) dialog: (after a silence) Get in. I’11 drive you... JOHN DALE’S VOICE No, thanks. Another silence...
0) 1146) dialog: Chicken -- ? There is no reply... After a long moment, JAKE turns away, puts his foot on the pedal and, with a frantic screeching of tires, the car swerves out through the gates and off down the highway...
