4) 8) dialog: (on tv) Reporting live from outside the Hollywood estate of billionaire mogul Jefferson Sevence... we have confirmation that Sevence has apparently gone missing after a late night fishing trip off the coast of Catalina Island. Witnesses claim to have seen him returning to the main land, and his car, a 1935 Deusenberg, has yet to be located. The actress turns her head and looks back at the tv, stil taking it from Sam. A picture of JEFFERSON SEVENCE appears on screen. He's an older man, though handsome, and with still blond hair. The television cuts to a shot of MRS. SEVENCE, a thirty- something woman more than suitable for providing progeny affection to a wealthy man.
