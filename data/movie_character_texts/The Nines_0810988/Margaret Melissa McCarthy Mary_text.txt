6) 1) dialog: La la la la la. Like you've never done worse.
6) 3) dialog: Okay, yes. He totalled a car. But it was an environmentally friendly car. Why doesn't that get reported?
6) 5) dialog: Please! He was heartbroken, betrayed. You say you understand but you don't. You can't. You're like a big giant Vulcan.
6) 7) dialog: He's coming. I'll call you later. She hangs up, wrapping the earpiece around her phone.   W reveal
6) 9) dialog: Hi.    Margaret. I work for Lola.
6) 11) dialog: I know. (to the Parole Officer)
7) 0) text: Margaret leads the way.      She's been here before.
7) 2) dialog: A few. Not Hugh Grant level. More like Robert Downey, Jr. when he broke into that family's house and slept in the kid's bed like Goldilocks. "This bed is just right." I handled episodes two through four for Robert. This sort of thing is my specialty.
7) 4) dialog: Famous fuck-ups. Don't worry. Mama's gonna take good care of you. A phone RINGS.
8) 7) dialog: It's computer voice recognition. The system can call you any time day or night. If you don't answer within five rings, the police come and haul your ass off.
8) 9) dialog: That's why it's called house arrest. You stay inside your house. (to the officer)
9) 0) text: Margaret pulls open curtains, flooding the room with ligh Gary wanders, checking it all out.
9) 1) dialog: Okay, just so it's said, this house is flammable.
9) 3) dialog: Yeah, I didn't mean to eat my way into a ten-year shame spiral, but I did, and it's healthier to acknowledge it. (moving on)
9) 6) dialog: Writer. So for the next six weeks, su casa es su casa. I say, feel free to wear his clothes. He'll probably get a sick thrill of out it. The gays. Noticing two crates...
9) 8) dialog: They're away at summer camp.    Now, try the bed. He lies back on it, feeling it out.
9) 10) dialog: Comfortable?
9) 13) dialog: Look, Gary, I know this has been crazy and stressful. I want you to feel safe. And comfortable.
9) 15) dialog: I'm a fan of yours, you know.   Your number-one fan. Gary looks over his toes at Margaret. From this angle, sh looks a bit like Kathy Bates from Misery.
9) 16) dialog: But if you fuck this up, I will smash your ankles with a sledge hammer. A long beat.
9) 17) dialog: That wouldn't be comfortable for either of us.
10) 0) text: Margaret boxes up the alcohol while Gary bounces a lime o the island.
10) 1) dialog: I'll be coming by twice a day to check up on you. I'm the only person who should be coming by. No buddies, no pals, no heroin dealers...
10) 3) dialog: Yeah, crack is classy. And I'm not buying you porn. There's spray-per- view on cable.
10) 6) dialog: Let me see your phone. He hands over his cell phone.   She drops it in the contr box.
10) 8) dialog: Dial ten digits at random. Whoever answers will be better than the people on this phone. She picks up the liquor box, ready to go.
10) 9) dialog: You have my cell number. You have delivery menus. You're fine. Right?
18) 0) text: Margaret's brought coffee and pastries from Susina.
18) 1) dialog: Poltergeist, and no. Maybe they were rats. L.A. is teaming with rats. They live in the palm trees.
18) 3) dialog: Okay. You know I'm a licensed psychotherapist.
18) 5) dialog: No. I'm a publicist. My job is what other people think of you, not what you think of yourself. So pull your shit together. I am thisclose to getting Christine Walsh to do your piece in Parade.
18) 7) dialog: Everyone hates Parade. But the people who watch "Crime Lab," they love their Marilyn Vos Savant. Give them a woman of indeterminate age who solves riddles and they are in hee-haw heaven.
18) 9) dialog: One heartfelt act of contrition and maybe the showrunner won't kill off your character between seasons. He nods.   He gets it.
18) 11) dialog: I swear to God, if you go batshit on me...
18) 13) dialog: Exactly.    Exactly.
37) 1) dialog: Once again, the idea of house arrest is you stay inside your house.
38) 1) dialog: Think of it like an electronic leash. Basically, if you ever go more than 100 feet from the base station...
38) 4) dialog: ...the cops come, they throw your ass in jail. If you ever try to take it off, the cops come and throw your ass in jail. And if they ever detect drugs or alcohol in your system...
38) 6) dialog: No. I kick your ass. Then the cops come and throw your ass in jail. The parole officer smiles.
38) 8) dialog: No, I'll be doing that from now on. I'm moving into the guest room.
38) 10) dialog: Despite all evidence to the contrary. Don't worry, I'm a cool roomie. Who do you think taught Affleck how to gamble? The parole officer hits a test button on the anklet, whic lets out a PIERCING ALARM.
38) 11) dialog: Let's never hear that again.

40) 8) dialog: You cut his ear off?
40) 11) dialog: Wait. You were in Pirates of the Caribbean?
41) 0) text: Ready for bed, Margaret leans out the guest bedroom door.

43) 1) dialog: It's incredible.
43) 3) dialog: ...I was born at the wrong time.
44) 0) text: VARIOUS SHOTS: Gary and Margaret jump with all their migh bouncing off the walls, SCREAMING all the time. When both finally collapse, it becomes strangely tranquil They're safe inside an inflatable paradise. Gary scoots over beside Margaret.     She puts her head o arms. It's nice. Prelap:   A doorbell RINGS.
47) 1) dialog: What are "the Nines?"
47) 4) dialog: "Look for the Nines."
47) 6) dialog: It's your handwriting.
47) 8) dialog: Okay. She puts it back down.    But she doesn't believe him.
47) 9) dialog: All-ee-all-ee-all-come-free.
47) 12) dialog: Nothing.
47) 14) dialog: Nothing. I thought you were...forget it. Done.    Sorry. 171
48) 0) text: At the far edge of the property, Margaret and Gary play backgammon. Their mood is significantly more subdued. Margaret answers her RINGING cell phone.
48) 1) dialog: Yhello? Hi. What?! (to Gary)
48) 2) text: I have to take this. He nods.   Margaret starts walking back to the house.
48) 3) dialog: (on phone)
49) 2) dialog: I know who you are.
49) 4) dialog: I know what you are. And if you come near him again...
49) 6) text: Margaret lets that go unanswered.   There's obviously something big we're not privy to.
49) 8) text: She's forgotten Margaret's name -- if she ever knew it.
49) 10) dialog: Margaret.
49) 12) dialog: Why can't you just leave him alone?
49) 17) text: Sarah lets her warning land, then walks past Margaret, heading back down the stairs. REVEAL Gary watching through the hole in the door.

51) 1) dialog: Goodnight, ratface.
53) 18) dialog: Morning.
53) 19) dialog: enters, carrying her tea. She sees Gary by himself, leani near the bars of the trellis.
53) 20) dialog: Everything okay?
53) 22) dialog: Peachy's good. I like peaches.
53) 23) text: we see that Sarah is flush back against the wall, out of Margaret's line of sight.
53) 24) dialog: You want coffee?
54) 3) text: No. MARGARET
54) 5) text: Tell me about the Nines. MARGARET
54) 7) text: The Nines. MARGARET
54) 9) text: Try. And don't tell me I'm imagining it. They're showing up everywhere, and I want to know why. Trying to formulate the simplest truthful explanation: MARGARET
54) 11) text: I'm a Nine? MARGARET
54) 15) text: Happy? She gestures for him to sit down.     Reluctantly, he doe sits across from him. MARGARET (CONT'D)
54) 17) text: Talking. MARGARET
54) 19) text: I never met you before I came here. MARGARET
54) 21) text: No.   I'm a lot confused. MARGARET

54) 25) text: I'm in a coma. MARGARET

54) 32) dialog: Everything is what it is. But you're not who you think you are. 178
54) 34) dialog: God, no!   Please, Gary, don't. But he's already outside. 180
55) 0) text: He's walking towards the blue chalk perimeter line, heade for Sarah's house. Leaves fall lazily from the trees, counter-point to the tension. Margaret calls out from the arched windows.
55) 1) dialog: You don't know what you're doing. She's almost at tears.   He stops at the edge of the chal line.
55) 3) dialog: I don't know. But it's not good. He very deliberately steps over the line. We hear a thin BEEPING from the house-arrest anklet. He shoots her a loo to say, is that all there is? But the BEEPING grows louder, deeper. It starts to come f all sides, booming, a nuclear-meltdown/self-destruct-sequ activated DRONE. Gary suddenly realizes something very, very terrible is a to happen.
55) 5) text: Oh shit. The world ignites in white-hot atomic flames. We see the blinding glare erupt behind Margaret, illumina through her skin, right to the bone. The same flash catches a leaf in mid-air, sizzling throug like an etched x-ray. As the light hits Gary, we...
103) 1) dialog: I can understand why you're a little confused.
103) 3) dialog: Theories?
103) 5) dialog: No.
103) 7) dialog: (amused) No.

103) 15) text: Are you saying I'm God? MARGARET
103) 17) text: So what are you? MARGARET
103) 19) text: What are the eights? MARGARET
103) 22) text: What's important is that you, you're the big cheese. El Supremo. You could destroy the world with a single thought. (suddenly) Don't, incidentally. Just file that away. But the truth is, you hold all the cards: every church, every candle, every sacrifice -- that's for you. When people pray, they're not praying because they want this thing or that thing. They just don't want to be forgotten. MARGARET (CONT'D)
103) 24) text: Yeah. MARGARET
126) 1) dialog: You could destroy the world with a single thought. (suddenly) Don't, incidentally. Just file that away.
