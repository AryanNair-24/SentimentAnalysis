7) 5) text: Dr. Hannibal Lecter is lounging on his bunk, in white paj reading an Italian Vogue. He turns, considers her... A fa so long out of the sun, it seems almost leached - except the glittering eyes, and the wet red mouth. He rises smoo crossing to stand before her; the gracious host. His voic is cultured, soft.
7) 6) dialog: Good morning.
7) 9) dialog: "We" being the Behavioral Science  Unit, at Quantico. You're one of  Jack Crawford's, I expect.
7) 11) dialog: May I see your credentials?
7) 13) dialog: Closer, please... Clo-ser...
7) 15) dialog: (continuing) That expires in one week. You're not  real FBI, are you?
7) 17) dialog: Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
7) 19) dialog: Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of  you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
7) 21) dialog: Now then. What did Miggs say to you? (she is puzzled) "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell.  He hissed at you. What did he say?
7) 23) dialog: I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan  skin cream, and sometimes you wear  L'Air du Temps, but not today. You  brought your best bag, though, didn't  you?
7) 25) dialog: It's much better than your shoes.
7) 27) dialog: I have no doubt of it.
7) 29) dialog: Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the  Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
7) 31) dialog: Memory, Officer Starling, is what I  have instead of view.
7) 34) dialog: No, no, no. You were doing fine,  you'd been courteous and receptive  to courtesy, you'd established trust  with the embarrassing truth about  Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue  into your questionnaire. It won't  do. It's stupid and boring.
7) 36) dialog: Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed  if he's recruiting help from the  student body. Busy hunting that new  one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty  boy! Did Crawford send you to ask  for my advice on him?
7) 38) dialog: How many women has he used, our Bill?
7) 40) dialog: All flayed...?
7) 42) dialog: Do you know why he's called Buffalo  Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't  say.
7) 44) dialog: Witless and misleading. Why do you  think he takes their skins, Officer  Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
7) 46) dialog: I didn't.
7) 49) dialog: Send that through.
7) 51) dialog: Oh, Officer Starling... do you think  you can dissect me with this blunt  little tool?
7) 54) dialog: You're sooo ambitious, aren't you...?  You know what you look like to me,  with your good bag and your cheap  shoes? You look like a rube. A well- scrubbed, hustling rube with a little,  taste... Good nutrition has given  you some length of bone, but you're  not more than one generation from  poor white trash, are you Officer  Starling...? That accent you're trying  so desperately to shed - pure West  Virginia. What was your father, dear?  Was he a coal miner? Did he stink of  the lamp...? And oh, how quickly the  boys found you! All those tedious,  sticky fumblings, in the back seats  of cars, while you could only dream  of getting out. Getting anywhere - yes? Getting all the way - to the  F...B...I.
7) 57) dialog: You're a tough one, aren't you?
7) 59) dialog: And you'd hate to think you were  common. My, wouldn't that sting!  Well you're far from common, Officer  Starling. All you have is the fear  of it. (beat) Now please excuse me. Good day.
7) 61) dialog: A census taker once tried to test  me. I ate his liver with some fava  beans and a nice chianti... Fly back  to school, little Starling.
7) 67) dialog: Officer Starling... Officer Starling!
7) 69) dialog: Who's shivering with rage. For an instant his face opens, and we catch a glimpse into hell itself. Then he's compos again.
7) 70) dialog: I would not have had that happen to  you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably  ugly to me.
7) 72) dialog: No. But I will make you happy...  I'll give you a chance for what you  love most, Clarice Starling.
7) 74) dialog: Advancement, of course. (beat) Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an  old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T...  Now go. Go. (a smile) I don't think Miggs could manage  again so soon, even if he is crazy -  do you?
19) 2) text: PAN TO Clarice, with her wet hair plastered flat, sitting the corridor floor to one side of this TV, which has been stationed so that Dr. Lecter cannot avoid seeing it.
19) 10) dialog: Your bleeding has stopped.
19) 12) dialog: Why don't you ask me about Buffalo  Bill?
19) 14) dialog: I might if I saw the case file. You  could get that for me.
19) 16) dialog: (sighs) His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A  former patient of mine, whose romantic  attachments ran to, shall we say,  the exotic...? I didn't kill him,  merely tucked him away. Very much as  I found him, in that ridiculous car,  in his own garage, after he's missed  three appointments. You'd have him  under "Missing Person" - which, in  poor Raspail's case, could hardly be  more true.
19) 18) dialog: Who can say...? Best thing for him,  really. His therapy was going nowhere.
19) 20) dialog: And have them clomping about in my  life? Oh dear, no... At that time I  still had certain private amusements  of my own. (beat) How did you feel when you saw him,  Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
19) 22) dialog: Ahhh... Why?
19) 24) dialog: Do you have something you use, when  you need to get up your courage?  Memories, tableaux... scenes from  your early life?
19) 26) dialog: Jack Crawford is helping your career,  isn't he? Apparently he likes you.  And you like him, too.
19) 28) dialog: Your first lie to me, Clarice. How  sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford  wants you, sexually? True, he's much  older, but - do you think he  visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...?  Fucking you?
19) 30) dialog: Not anymore. (beat) Surely the odd confluence of events  hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford  dangles you before me. Then I give  you a bit of help. Do you think it's  because I like to look at you, and  imagine how good you would taste...?
19) 32) dialog: Or doesn't this all begin to suggest  to you a kind of... negotiation?  There's something Crawford can give  me, and I want to trade for it. I  even wrote to him, offering my help.  But he hates me, so he won't deal  directly.
19) 33) text: Dr. Lecter slowly turns up the rheostat in his cell. As h lights rise, we see that the cell's been stripped bare. G are his books, drawings, mattress - even his toilet seat. She stands, too, startled. They face each other.
19) 34) dialog: Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just  like that gospel program. When you  leave, they'll turn the volume way  up. Chilton does enjoy his petty  torments.
19) 36) dialog: I've been in this room for eight  years, Clarice. I know they will  never, ever let me out while I'm  alive. What I want is a view. I want  a window where I can see a tree, or  even water. I want to be in a federal  institution, away from Chilton - and  I want a view. I'll give good value  for it. Crawford could do that for  me, but he won't. You persuade him.
19) 38) dialog: Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you  and Jack Crawford are most anxious  to meet.
19) 40) text: But Dr. Lecter only smiles, enigmatically.
19) 41) dialog: Who is he stalking right now, Clarice?  I wonder, don't you? How many more  young women will have to die, before  you trade with me...?
43) 0) text: Dr. Lecter sits at his table, languidly sketching with  charcoal on butcher paper. He uses his own hand and forearm as a model. His other  drawings, books, and bedding have been restored.
43) 1) dialog: Wouldn't you say, Clarice, that for  a United States Senator, you're an  odd choice of messenger?
43) 4) dialog: That is both impudent and untrue...  Tell me, how did you feel when you  viewed our Billy's latest effort? (beat; he smiles) Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
43) 6) dialog: Life's too slippery for books,  Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from  the same God. (beat) Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was  she a large girl?
43) 8) dialog: Big through the hips. Roomy.
43) 10) dialog: Mmm. And what else...?
43) 12) dialog: Was it a butterfly?
43) 14) dialog: I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice.  Enchant me.
43) 22) dialog: "Plum Island Animal Disease Research  Center." Sounds charming.
43) 24) dialog: Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it  will be "turns" with us, too. Quid  pro quo. I tell you things, you tell  me things. Not about this case, though -  about yourself. Yes or no? (she is silent) Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is  waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...
43) 27) dialog: What's your worst memory of childhood? (she hesitates) Quicker than that. I'm not interested  in your worst invention.
43) 29) dialog: Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
43) 32) dialog: Killed outright?
43) 34) dialog: You're very frank, Clarice. I think -  it would be quite something to know  you in private life.
43) 36) dialog: The significance of the moth is  change. Caterpillar into cocoon into  beauty... Billy wants to change,  too, Clarice. But there's the problem  of his size, you see. Even if he  were a woman, he'd have to be a big  one...
43) 38) dialog: Clever girl. You're so close to the  way you're going to catch him - do  you realize that?
43) 40) dialog: After your father's death, you were  orphaned. What happened next? (Clarice drops her  gaze) I don't imagine the answer's on those  second-rate shoes, Clarice.
43) 42) dialog: A cattle ranch?
43) 44) dialog: How long did you live there?
43) 46) dialog: Why so briefly?
43) 48) dialog: Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck  you?
43) 50) dialog: Did he try to?
43) 52) dialog: Billy's not a real transsexual, but  he thinks he is. He tries to be.  He's tried to be a lot of things, I  expect.
43) 54) dialog: There are three major centers for  transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins,  the University of Minnesota, and  Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't  be surprised if Billy has applied  for sex reassignment at one or all  of them, and been rejected.
43) 56) dialog: The personality inventories would  trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler,  House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't  test like a real transsexual.
43) 58) text: Suddenly Dr. Lecter snarls, loudly, stretching. Clarice t a sharp step backwards before he smiles, turning his move into an elaborate yawn. He gathers the papers from his tr
43) 59) dialog: That's enough, I think. Happy hunting.  Oh, and Clarice - next time you will  tell me why you ran away. Shall I  summarize?
44) 1) dialog: You should try to obtain a list of  males rejected from all three gender  reassignment centers...
44) 3) dialog: Check first the ones rejected for  lying about criminal records...
44) 5) dialog: Among those who tried to conceal  their past, look for severe childhood  disturbances, associated with  violence... Possibly you'll find a  childhood incarceration... Then go  to their personality tests...
44) 7) dialog: Study their drawings, especially.  Billy's house drawings will show no  happy future... No baby carriage,  out in the yard. No pets, no toys,  no flowers, no sun...
44) 9) dialog: His females will be more crudely  sketched than him males - but he'll  compensate by adding exaggerated  adornments... jewelry, big breasts...  And his tree drawings - oh, his trees  will be frightful...
44) 11) dialog: Billy hates his own identity, he  always has - and he thinks that makes  him a transsexual. But his pathology  is a thousand times more savage...  He wants to be reborn, Clarice. He  will be reborn...
45) 0) text: MOVING ANGLE - CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter's slippered feet, whic rest on the shelf of a rolling hand truck. RISING along h tilted form, we see that his ankles are linked by steel  restraints... his legs, waist, upper torso, and arms are  bound by heavy canvas webbing... beneath the webbing is a strait-jacket... and over his face is a hockey mask.
45) 2) text: shows that Dr. Lecter, on the handtruck, is being pushed  down his corridor by Barney, and back into his open cell.
46) 0) text: Chilton lounges on Dr. Lecter's cot, casually reading his large stack of private correspondence, and making notatio with his gold pen on a little pad. Another orderly mops t floor.
46) 8) text: CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter's glittering eyes, behind their slits
46) 20) text: A beat. Dr. Lecter is silent. Chilton sticks his face INT SHOT, almost intimately close to the mask. He is agitated
46) 22) dialog: (pause; then softly) I'll tell the Senator herself. But  only in Tennessee...
53) 0) text: CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter. Behind his mask, the alert, searchin eyes.
53) 5) dialog: Oh yes, Officer Pembry. I certainly  do.
53) 20) dialog: I won't waste your time and  Catherine's time bargaining for petty  privileges. Clarice Starling and  that awful Jack Crawford have wasted  far too much already. I only pray  they haven't doomed the poor girl...  Let me help you now, and I'll trust  you when it's all over.
53) 23) dialog: Buffalo Bill's real name is William  Rubin. I met him just once. He was  referred to me in April or May, 1980,  by my patient Benjamin Raspail. They  were lovers, but Raspail had become  very frightened. Apparently Rubin  had murdered a transient, and - done  things with the skin. He thought if  I could cure Billy, then Billy'd be  safe from the police, and he's be  safe from Billy... Obviously, he was  wrong.
53) 25) dialog: Did you nurse Catherine?
53) 27) dialog: Did you breast-feed her?
53) 32) dialog: Toughened your nipples, didn't it...? (a beat; then rapidly,  bored) Six foot one, strongly built, about  190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale  blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said  he lived in Philadelphia, but may  have lied. That's really all I can  remember, Senator - but if I think  of any more, I'll let you know.
53) 35) dialog: Senator Martin...! You can't trust  Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling.  It's such a game with these people.  They're determined to get the arrest  for themselves. The "collar," I think  they say.
53) 37) dialog: Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
61) 0) text: The old courthouse is a massive Gothic stronghold, with a armada of police cruisers parked at the curb. Clarice climbs from her rented car, SLAMMING the door ang Holding a rolled-up pile of papers - Dr. Lecter's drawing she starts determinedly up the steps. A nearby commotion  makes her pause. Dr. Frederick Chilton in a sea of interviewers and mini-c is preening grandly.  Clarice carefully avoiding his gaze, slips up the steps a inside.
64) 0) text: Pembry, at a desk by the door, looks up from examining th unrolled pile of Dr. Lecter's drawings.
64) 6) dialog: (without turning) Good afternoon, Clarice.
64) 9) dialog: How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle -  before you're both booted off the  case?
64) 12) dialog: People will say we're in love. (beat) Pity you tried to fool me, isn't it?  Pity for poor Catherine. Tick-tock...
64) 16) dialog: Clarice... you're hardly in a position  to accuse me of lying.
64) 18) dialog: I've studied the case file, have  you...? Everything you need to find  him is right in these pages. Whatever  his name is.
64) 20) dialog: First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.  Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each  particular thing, ask: What is it,  in itself, what is its nature...?  What does he do, this man you seek?
64) 22) dialog: (sharply, as he stops) No! That's incidental.
64) 24) dialog: What is the first and principal thing  he does, what need does he serve by  killing?
64) 26) dialog: No, he covets. That's his nature.  And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?  Do we seek out things to covet? Make  an effort to answer.
64) 28) dialog: No. Precisely. We begin by coveting  what we see every day. Don't you  feel eyes moving over your body,  Clarice? I hardly see how you  couldn't. And don't your eyes move  over the things you want?
64) 30) dialog: No. It's your turn to tell me,  Clarice. You don't have any more  vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island.  Why did you run away from that ranch?
64) 32) dialog: We don't reckon time the same way,  Clarice. This is all the time you'll  ever have.
64) 34) dialog: I'll listen now. After your father's  murder, you were orphaned. You were  ten years old. You went to live with  cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch  in Montana. And - ?
64) 37) dialog: Not "just," Clarice. What set you  off? You started what time?
64) 39) dialog: Then something woke you. What? Did  you dream...? What was it?
64) 42) dialog: What was it?
64) 48) dialog: What did you do?
64) 53) dialog: And what did you see, Clarice?
64) 58) dialog: They were slaughtering the spring  lambs?
64) 60) dialog: So you ran away...
64) 62) dialog: But you could. You did.
64) 65) dialog: Where were you going?
64) 69) dialog: But what became of your lamb? (no response) Clarice...?
64) 71) dialog: You still wake up sometimes, don't  you? Wake up in the dark, with the  lambs screaming?
64) 73) dialog: Do you think if you saved Catherine,  you could make them stop...? Do you  think, if Catherine lives, you won't  wake up in the dark, ever again, to  the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
64) 75) dialog: (a pause; then, oddly  at peace) Thank you, Clarice.
64) 77) dialog: Dr. Chilton... I believe you know  each other?
64) 82) dialog: Brave Clarice. Will you let me know  if ever the lambs stop screaming?
64) 84) dialog: Promise...? (she nods. He smiles) Then why not take your case file? I  won't be needing it anymore.
64) 88) dialog: Good-bye, Clarice.
67) 4) dialog: Just another minute, please!
67) 10) dialog: lines up his thumbnail just shy of the square edge, then  braces it against the stainless steel toilet rim. He push down, hard, using both hands for leverage. After a moment smiles, holding up the result, and twirling it before his eyes.
67) 14) text: Dr. Lecter sits on the floor, legs straight, then wriggle backwards. He stretches his arms behind him, hands and wr through the bars, with two bars between them, and clasps hands.
67) 15) dialog: I'm ready when you are, Officer  Pembry.
67) 16) text: Pembry comes around the cell to squat behind Dr. Lecter. tugs his hands farther out, rather roughly, handcuffs his wrists. He shakes the cuffs, making sure of them, then no to Boyle.
67) 18) dialog: watches as Boyle approaches the table, above five feet fr him. Boyle has to set his tray down on the floor to clear off some of the mess of drawings. The MUSIC plays on.
67) 19) text: ...Dr. Lecter's hands, outside the bars, as the makeshift key, held between the tips of his right index and middle  fingers, searches for the keyhole of the cuffs. And finds it.
67) 24) text: Pembry starting into the cell, reaching for his riot bato Dr. Lecter smashing against the cell door, driving it int Pembry, pinning him across the chest, against the door  frame... Boyle, on one knee on the floor, digging desperately in h pants pocket for his handcuff key... Pembry's hand, mashed against his body by the door, as he strains frantically to reach the baton at his waist...  Pembry's eyes, widening in horror as he stares at... Dr. Lecter's bared teeth, flashing towards him... Dr. Lecter gripping Pembry's face in his jaws, shaking it like a dog shakes a rat... Boyle finding his key, but in his terror dropping it... Dr. Lecter yanking the mace can and riot baton from the d Pembry's belt, spraying him in his bloody face, then club him to his knees... Boyle, mouth open in a silent scream, finding his key aga unlocking the handcuff, but then, as he starts to rise,  seeing... Dr. Lecter standing over him, with the riot baton raised  high; he swings it viciously down, again and again and  again... Then normal SOUND and MOTION are restored as we go to -
67) 26) dialog: eyes closed, lost in a favorite passage of the music. His bloody fingers drift airily with the notes, as his breath slows to normal. He opens his eyes, sighs contentedly, lo down.
67) 28) dialog: picks up the pocketknife, examines it happily. About a fo inch blade. He becomes aware of the WHIMPERING, off scree turns.
87) 3) dialog: Clarice, doesn't this random  scattering of sites seem overdone to  you? Doesn't it seem desperately  random - like the elaborations of a  bad liar? Ta... Hannibal Lecter.
94) 13) dialog: Billy wants to change, too, Clarice.  But there's the problem of his size,  you see...
94) 17) dialog: Even if he were a woman, he'd have  to be a big one...
130) 2) dialog: Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped  screaming...?
130) 5) dialog: Don't bother with a trace, I won't  be on long enough.
131) 1) dialog: Where I have a view, Clarice...
131) 3) dialog: Orion is looking splendid tonight,  and Arcturus, the Herdsman, with his  flock...
131) 4) dialog: smiles into his mobile phone. He is stretched out on a  lounger, on a tiled patio, languidly paring an orange wit penknife. His appearance is quite altered - a beard, glas lighter hair. He's has some cosmetic surgery, as well.
131) 5) dialog: (into phone) Your lambs are still for now, Clarice,  but not forever... You'll have to  earn it again and again, this blessed  silence. Because it's the plight  that drives you, and the plight will  never end.
131) 7) dialog: I have no plans to call on you,  Clarice, the world being more  interesting with you in it. Be sure  you extend me the same courtesy.
131) 9) dialog: Goodbye, Clarice... (and then, softly) You looked - so very lovely today,  in your blue suit.
133) 0) text: Dr. Lecter sighs, sets his phone down, then rises. Poppin an orange section into his mouth, he turns towards the  brightly lit house. Stepping delicately over the sprawled body of a uniformed security guard, he walks in through o french doors.
134) 0) text: In a swivel chair, amidst the wreckage of his papers and  books, is the writhing figure of Dr. Frederick Chilton. T extreme intricacy of his bindings recalls Dr. Lecter's ow former restraints. His screams are muffled by the tape ov his mouth; he stares at Dr. Lecter like a rabbit trapped headlights.
134) 1) dialog: Considers him for a genial moment, then raises the little pen-knife. His eyes are twinkling.
134) 2) dialog: Well, Dr. Chilton. Shall we begin?
