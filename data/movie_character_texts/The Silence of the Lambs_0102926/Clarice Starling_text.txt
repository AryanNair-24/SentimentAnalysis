11) 7) dialog: I spent all evening on the mainframe.  Lecter altered or destroyed most of  his patient histories, prior to  capture. No record of anyone named  Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like  it might have have something to do  with divorce. I tracked it down in  the library's catalogue of national  yellow pages.

She peels back a bit of glove, revealing the white, synth elbow. She smiles, shaking her head at her own jumpiness, she reaches over the mannequin's lap to loosen the evenin bag's drawstring. A SEVERED HUMAN HEAD stares back at her, as the beaded  material slides away. Clarice lurches back, gasping loudly, and several long, h pounding moments pass before she can make herself look mo closely. The head bobs gently in a pool of alcohol, in a laborator specimen jar. It is a man's head, but grotesquely transfo by the addition of heavy makeup, earrings, and a sodden w into a woman's face. Over the years the makeup has smeare badly, and the pupils have gone almost milky white.
