Teens dance a bit provocatively with one another. A few grind up and down each other’s thighs. They are having a great time. The energy is infectious, intoxicating.

One YOUNG MAN is left in tears. He seems deeply ashamed. MS. DWYER leans to him, putting an affectionate hand on h shoulder. The kid brushes it off and we pan with him as h exits by himself.
