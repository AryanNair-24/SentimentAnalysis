49) 28) dialog: Don’t say ugly things like that. That’s not true.
49) 30) dialog: Well, sometimes I’ve got a short fuse, you know, cause I don’t sleep a lot and I’ve got a lot of stuff on my plate. There’s no money in music anymore. It’s all branded content and Virtual Reality. I do voices for a video game character now for Christ’s sake, and I make more money in an afternoon than all year on tour.
49) 32) dialog: It’s a lot more complicated than that. If I don’t keep up with the times, the times leave without me, you know, and I got a lot of people to pay. More people than you can imagine. It’s a full-time job. It’s like I’m connected to the whole world all the time. I can hear everyone in my head.
49) 34) dialog: What do you want to talk about? Is she okay?
49) 36) dialog: She told you this? That really pisses me off that she’s bringing our problems into my relationship with you cause that has nothing to do with you. You got that? Nothing.
49) 38) dialog: That’s ridiculous.
49) 40) dialog: Hey, what can I say, your aunt has too many scruples and sometimes life just isn’t that fair. Especially not nowadays. CELESTE tries to come at her point from a different angle
49) 41) dialog: People now will try and sell yaa TV monitor that plain as day looks like shit, but they call it “ultra,” “mega,” “triple hi-def,” whatever, and their business model relies on their customer's unshakable stupidity. (MORE )
49) 43) dialog: Deep down maybe we probably all sense this - their intimate knowledge of our commitment to the lowest common denominator - but we go along with it anyway. CELESTE laughs.
49) 45) dialog: I mean, I’m pretty sure that every year my videos look worse and worse but they're doing better and better. For example, they showed me this perfume thing we shot last year where I’m unfurling from a digital rose petal like Thumbelina and I thought it would ruin me! But here I am opening for 70,000.
49) 47) dialog: I’m letting you in on a secret cause I love you, that’s what. It doesn’t matter anymore if you're Michelangelo or Michael & Angelo from Ridgewood, you just need an angle. And Aunt Ellie never found an angle. She had her head in the clouds and then she decided to be jealous of my good fortune. She made her own choices and let me tell you, she could never do what I do, day in and day out. Luckily, she gets to go home to you every night and she doesn’t have any real life responsibilities because I finance her entire life.
49) 49) dialog: Don’t tell me to be quiet. ALBERTINE rolls her eyes. 64.
49) 51) dialog: I’m sorry. Let me go ask them to turn it off. CELESTE stands and walks over to the bar. Camera pans wit her...
49) 52) dialog: Hey, can you turn that off please? We’re about to order some lunch and I'm trying to talk with my kid but all I can hear is my voice inside of my head.
49) 54) dialog: It’s fine, listen, can you send me over a drink and maybe a soda for her?
49) 56) dialog: I don’t know, a glass of white wine or something, whatever you have that isn’t gross. And can you put it in a plastic cup or something?
49) 59) dialog: Hey, I’m sorry to rag so much on Ellie. I know she’s doing her best. I’m having a shit day and I’m taking it out on her. Beat. 65.
49) 61) dialog: I never take it out on you.
49) 63) dialog: I don’t, do I?
49) 64) dialog: Well, if I do, I don’t mean to. CELESTE suddenly has tears in her eyes.
49) 65) dialog: Sometimes when you think it can’t get any worse, you get diagnosed with some freakin’ disease, you know what I mean? ALBERTINE shifts in her chair.
49) 67) dialog: No, I don’t mean literally, I just mean sometimes you get kicked when you're down. CELESTE can’t stop crying.
49) 68) dialog: I’m sorry. I shouldn’t do this in front of you.
49) 70) dialog: (forces a smile) No, it’s not. I'd slap me in the face if I was sitting across from me right now.
49) 72) dialog: Dan left me.
49) 74) dialog: You read about it?! Aunt Ellie’s not supposed to let you read all that gossip shit.
49) 76) dialog: Yeah, but I just wanted to be the one to tell you. I feel like big moments keep getting stolen away from me.
49) 78) dialog: I thought you loved Dan.
49) 81) dialog: I think we need another second with the menu. Thanks.
49) 84) dialog: It’s fine, I don’t need anything. Just bring her some pasta. The server walks away.
49) 86) dialog: Who said he left me?
49) 88) dialog: Well, he didn’t. We left each other because if you love something you give it away.
49) 90) dialog: Is that what you read?
49) 92) dialog: I don’t know. If he is, he didn’t tell me about it. I’m sure it’s just a fling. I’ve had flings too that I don’t want anyone to define my character by. The RESTAURANT MANAGER suddenly interrupts the flow of conversation. CELESTE keeps her face down.
49) 94) dialog: Yes, thank you. 68.
49) 96) dialog: Will do, thanks. BEAT. He doesn’t go away.
49) 98) dialog: I’m sorry but now’s not a great time.

50) 2) dialog: Let’s make a right here and go around the back so we don’t have to deal with all those shitheads out front. They turn right and walk... Beat.
50) 3) dialog: I’m really sorry I lost my cool with that guy.
50) 5) dialog: You seem shook up. That kind of thing doesn’t happen all the time, you know, but sometimes it does and I gotta protect myself.
50) 7) dialog: But baby, we gotta talk about it, otherwise, it’s just gonna hang in the air. Why don’t you want to talk to me? ALBERTINE sulks.
50) 8) dialog: You got tears in your eyes. Come on, what is it? ALBERTINE’s voice cracks with heartbreak but they never s walking.
50) 12) dialog: Worried about me?! Come on, you don’t need to worry about ME. I’m solid. I worry about YOU. That’s my job, to worry about you. shakes her head.
50) 14) dialog: That’s cause I’m in great shape from going out and dancing my ass off every night. CELESTE squeezes her close. ALBERTINE wipes some tears of her face.
50) 15) dialog: Come on, baby. You’re breaking my heart. Listen up, what that guy said about me having alcohol on my breath; that was a terrible thing to imply in front of you and instead of just ignoring the elephant in the room, we need to talk about it, head-on. CELESTE finds the words...
50) 16) dialog: I ordered a glass of wine from them in a plastic cup cause I needed to let go of some tension I’m having about tonight and I didn’t want you to think there was anything to worry about. I swear on your life I wasn’t drinking before that today. You don’t need to worry about stuff like that, okay?

51) 3) dialog: I have her upstairs in my room taking a pregnancy test cause apparently you’re so fucking incompetent that you let my daughter get fucked by some hick from town.
51) 5) dialog: Unless she’s as unlucky as me then probably not but I want her to feel the unease of waiting for the results to come in because a parent, or legal guardian, disciplines the kid, doesn’t just hang out with them.
51) 7) dialog: You fucked up. CELESTE holds up two fingers.
51) 8) dialog: Twice.
51) 10) dialog: How could I be so stupid?! If you did so badly with me how could I ever expect you to do right by her. ELEANOR stammers...
51) 12) dialog: Are you a retard?
51) 16) dialog: Only crazy people get aggravated when you call them crazy so you must really be retarded.
51) 18) dialog: Is that the kind of garbage you've been filling her head with? She told me all the shit you’ve been putting on her shoulders. CELESTE uses two fingers to press the middle of ELEANOR’s skull.
51) 19) dialog: You have that hapless look like dad. ELEANOR sits down in a chair and sobs. HOLD ON THIS...
51) 20) dialog: I have a press conference then two hours of round tables but I swear to God, Ellie, if my daughter comes back to me with that cross-eyed Guido’s kitten litter or Hepatitis Z, I'll throw you off that balcony. ELEANOR wipes the tears from her face.

53) 2) dialog: First I’d like to say that I have.. an outpour of love for victims of this tragedy and victims of violence all over the world and I am deeply saddened to be associated with such an obscene and unnecessary tragedy... It’s a weird time we live in, and I guess, no matter how much we try and ignore these things that are really happening around us, they always find a way to creep in.
53) 4) dialog: No idea. I pretty much know as much as you so far, and since nobody's coming out and saying “we did this” yet, I'd really prefer not to speculate too much - but if they did pick that “disguise” on purpose I guess it’s cause they don’t like that I’m a woman or that I’ma successful woman. Maybe they don’t like that I had a kid when I was a kid. Maybe they think I’m a floozy. But I guess some of you think that too. CELESTE shrugs and smiles.
53) 5) dialog: The way I have chosen to live my life goes against some people’s views about things.
53) 7) dialog: I mean, not really. Not that I know of. I’ve never played there so I really don’t know. MODERATOR chimes in.
53) 10) dialog: There’s really not enough information yet for us to justify canceling and my dad always says, “never postpone joy,” so yeah, I'll play if they let me. CELESTE smiles and shrugs. 78.

53) 13) dialog: -and if they ever come to their senses and they'd like something new to believe in, they can start believing in me cause I’m the new faith and I’m not afraid of them. Hell, I’d even like to extend an invite to my show tonight. I’1l be sure to put “cowards in masks” on the guest list.
53) 17) dialog: 
53) 18) dialog: I don’t know. I’m just making a quip.
54) 1) text: CELESTE and her team are packed into an elevator. 79.
54) 3) dialog: I don’t want to talk about it.
54) 5) dialog: You give it a try sometime. I was nervous.
54) 7) dialog: Don’t give them so much credit, anyway, it was a joke.

55) 1) text: JOSIE enters with CELESTE and tells the group...
55) 2) dialog: (tongue in cheek) hello everybody. CELESTE seems even more strung out than before. She sits down in front of four journalists and various recording devices set up in front of her chair.
55) 5) dialog: Sci-fi anthems. The concept with this one was to create an experience as relentless and addictive as possible. A second JOURNALIST joins in...
55) 7) dialog: Okay... 81. CELESTE bites her lip.
55) 9) dialog: I mean, who cares? I was hesitant to even give a statement today because all these ultra-violent thugs want is to make headlines.

55) 10) dialog: -but I couldn’t just ignore the casualties, ya know. Makes me sick. JOURNALIST 2 writes down her statement.
55) 13) dialog: This is the culmination of my life’s work so far. You know, we worked on it for two years before bringing it to the public. 82.
55) 15) dialog: Year before that I was under a lot of stress after my accident- CELESTE smiles a bashful grin.
55) 16) dialog: -and it’s an expensive event to put on, and we also waited on all the best people to become available to help us make it happen. I wanted all my best dancers back.
55) 18) dialog: Injury, not serious injury. I never stopped making music so I don’t consider it a “resurgence.” I just wanted to channel all that anxiety and suffering into something tangible, something positive.
55) 20) dialog: I see what you’re doing.
55) 22) dialog: Don’t try and have me say “abruptly” anything. CELESTE laughs and lights a cigarette.
55) 23) dialog: There are three classifications of gunshot wounds to the spine. (MORE )
55) 25) dialog: I’m type three which is when the bullet is actually inside the intervertebral disc space. Now, type three injuries are subdivided into (A) spinal lesion not associated with perforation of abdominal viscera or (B) injury with perforation of abdominal organs. Thankfully, I’m type A., but it’s no secret to anybody that I take meds for my injury and that I never shoulda been behind the wheel of a car that night. CELESTE exhales and calls out for JOSIE.
55) 26) dialog: Josie!
55) 28) dialog: People used to talk about me like I was a hero and then all the sudden, I was lower than trailer trash. That’s what this show’s about; a rebirth. JOSIE, THE PUBLICIST enters the room to stop the intervie
55) 32) dialog: I said I can’t talk about it.
55) 36) dialog: This guy’s trying to kick me while I’m down.
55) 39) dialog: Why don’t you go and write about what happened to those innocent people today instead of trying to tear me down.
56) 3) dialog: One floor up. 1823. INT. CELESTE’S SUITE - MOMENTS LATER
56) 4) text: CELESTE enters to find THE MANAGER and ALBERTINE posed against her suite’s beachfront view in the middle of an embrace. 85.
56) 5) dialog: Get your hands off her. THE MANAGER squints his brow and lifts his hands from ALBERTINE.
56) 7) dialog: Go downstairs and get ready for the show. ALBERTINE starts to rush past CELESTE but CELESTE catches her.
56) 8) dialog: Come on, don’t do that. She whispers...
56) 9) dialog: I hope you didn’t take that thing I gave you. I over-reacted. ALBERTINE doesn’t respond.
56) 10) dialog: What? You want me to shout it from the rooftops? She pinches her daughter's side.
56) 11) dialog: I’m just not ready for you to grow up is all. You’re my little girl. Forgive me? ALBERTINE sort of smiles and nods her head.
56) 12) dialog: Hold on a minute. CELESTE grabs a bouquet of flowers from a vase in her roo and sets them next to some hotel stationary where she jot down a crudely written “I’m sorry I was a bitch” and sets it on a rose.
56) 13) dialog: Give these to Ellie. 86. She shoves the bouquet at ALBERTINE.
56) 15) dialog: For everything. Take them down and I‘1l meet you guys in the lobby. We'll head over together. I love you.
56) 18) dialog: Jesus. I almost forgot you were standing there. CAMERA pans over to THE MANAGER.
56) 19) dialog: Josie called off the rest of the day. Some guy was coming after me about Joel Hedlund and I just didn’t have the mental capacity or balls to take him on.
56) 21) dialog: No. Stay with me. CELESTE sits down with her legs spread across from THE MANAGER.
56) 22) dialog: You got any stuff left from last night?
56) 24) dialog: (frank, matter-of-fact) I’m done yammering for the day. THE MANAGER raises his eyebrows.
56) 25) dialog: What? Tonight’s second nature. I gotta get out of my head, you know that. I’m getting myself all worked up from over-thinking everything. I keep picturing all those people screaming and running all over the sand. THE MANAGER exhales, unsure.
56) 26) dialog: Come on, let’s just take what you have left. We won’t call for more until after the show and you can fuck me for a little while we’re high. CELESTE comically holds her hand up for a high five. THE MANAGER laughs, give her a high-five, then holds onto her hand. In a way, they really love each other.
57) 0) text: THE MANAGER exits holding the door open for CELESTE who i some fancy new wardrobe but looks obliterated.

63) 29) dialog: You can’t just press a button and take out your dishes!
63) 34) dialog: Everyone is talking about me like I’m not a person right in front of them! They’re right in front of me when they do it! ELEANOR holds CELESTE to her chest. CELESTE is an outrigh mess, sobbing and dazed.
63) 36) dialog: Ellie, they showed me these promos we shot and I looked so bad.
63) 38) dialog: No, don’t look at me like that, listen to me. They shot me with this new camera everyone told me is great but I looked so ugly. It made me want to die, Ellie. ELEANOR seems possessed.
