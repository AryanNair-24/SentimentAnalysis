So, should I serve it up there or will you come down? Up there? All right. No, I'll come down. We do meet under the most peculiar circumstances, Sabrina. Either you're under eight cars looking for a missing spark plug or you're perched up here umpiring a tennis match between two players who aren't there. Oh, you look lovely, Sabrina, and very grown up. I'd better get back to the party. And leave me here alone? What did David say? I don't know what you did to him, but I haven't seen him in such a state since he was kicked in the head by a polo pony at Old Westburry. That's nice. Amnesia has definitely set in. He's completely forgotten he's engaged. He wants you. And I want him. I've been in love with him all my life. Mmm, well, there goes the engagement! You don't object? Object? To you? It's as though a window had been thrown open and a lovely breeze swept through this stuffy old house. How could I object? Even though the breeze comes from the general direction of the garage?

The young prince fa in love with the waitress at the rathskeller and the Prim Minister is sent to buy her off. LINUS: Buy her off? SABRINA: Yes. He offers her 5000 kronen. "No," she says. "10,000?" "No." LINUS: 15,000 kronen? SABRINA: No. LINUS: 25,000 kronen? SABRINA: No. LINUS: 25,000 dollars? SABRINA: No. How did dollars get into this? LINUS: 25,000 dollars after taxes, that's a lot of money, Sabrina. SABRINA: What are you trying to say? LINUS: I'm just trying to make it worthwhile. What's a krone these days? No self-respecting Prime Minister would offer kronen. SABRINA: No self-respecting waitress would take dollars. LINUS: Good girl. Linus kisses Sabrina on the cheek. LINUS: Hey, how does this operetta end? What's the last a SABRINA: I don't know. I guess they run away to America o zeppelin with everybody singing like mad. LINUS: They open a brewery in Milwaukee? SABRINA: Yes. The love that made Milwaukee famous. 32 LINUS: Prosit! SABRINA: There it is. The song they were playing the nigh before I went away. David was right here dancing it with somebody else. Tonight I wanted it to be me. LINUS: It's all in the family. Linus begins to dance with Sabrina.

Was Sabrina mad because I didn't show up? LINUS: Not mad, just disappointed. DAVID: Ah, poor kid. What did you tell her? LINUS: The truth. That the family objected to her, but yo stood up like a man. DAVID: Good. LINUS: And sat down like a jerk. DAVID: 23 stitches. Linus hangs up the plastic hammock. LINUS: Here, this ought to make you feel better. DAVID: A plastic hammock? LINUS: Uh-huh,.

Coming and going, always wearing your black homburg, carrying a briefcase and an umbrella. I thought you could never belong to anyone, never care for anyone. Oh, yes, the cold businessman, way up in his executive suite. No emotion, just ice water in his veins, and ticker tape coming from his heart.

Once. Iwas there for 35 minutes. 35 minutes? Changing planes. I was on my way to Iraq on an oil deal. But Paris isn't for changing planes. It's ... It's for changing your outlook. For throwing open the windows and letting in ... letting in la vie en rose. Paris is for lovers. Maybe that's why I stayed only 35 minutes.

I'm sorry. FAIRCHILD: It's just not right, sir. I like to think of l alimousine. Though we're all driving together, we must remember our places. There's a front seat, a back seat and a window in between. LINUS: Fairchild, I never realized it before, but you're terrible snob. FAIRCHILD: Yes, sir. LINUS: All right.

Just imagine, you press a button and factories goup. Or you pick up a telephone and 100 tankers set out for Persia. Or you switch on a Dictaphone and say, "Buy all of Cleveland and move it to Pittsburgh." You must be awfully clever. Oh, it's nothing really. Just a small knack, like juggling three oranges. It isn't oranges, it's millions. Suppose you dropped one? Suppose I did? What's at the end of a million? Zero, zero, zero. Nothing. A circle with a hole in it. Sabrina... Yes, Linus? Can you keep a secret? Secret? Yes, of course you can. I want you to look out there. Linus points out over the harbor.

Then you find yourself someone really nice and drive her through the Bois de Boulogne in a taxi. The rain's very important because that's when Paris smells its sweetest. It's the damp chestnut trees, you see? LINUS: I see. SABRINA: You're very clever, Linus, and very rich. You ca order yourself some rain. LINUS: Sure. I can order myself some rain. I can get myse ataxi. That's easy. But can I find myself someone really nice? That's not so easy, Sabrina. 44 Linus and Sabrina are out on the dance floor. LINUS: How do you say in French, "My sister has a yellow pencil"? SABRINA: "Ma soeura un crayon jaune." LINUS: How do you say, "My brother has a lovely girl"?

SABRINA: We can't have you walking up and down the Champs looking like a tourist undertaker. And another thing, never a briefcase in Paris and never an umbrella. There's a law. LINUS: How am I ever going to get along in Paris without like you? Who'll be there to help me with my French? To turn down the brim of my hat?

SABRINA: We talked about a lot of things. LINUS: How's your little, er, mishap? DAVID: Shaping up beautifully. Dr. Calaway's so proud of job he wants to show it to his class at Columbia medical school. (to Sabrina) Oh, I'm sorry, Sabrina. SABRINA: It's very funny. DAVID: Say, Linus, while I was lying in that hammock, I g a great idea. (to Sabrina) He thinks I'm an idiot. (to Linus) How does this strike you?

DAVID: He's a little on the dull side, isn't he? But you can't help liking him. SABRINA: Kiss me, David. DAVID: I'd love to, Sabrina. SABRINA: Again. ... That's better. DAVID: What's the matter, darling? You're not worried abo us, aren't you? I'mnot. There'll be a big stink in the family. Who cares? SABRINA: David, I don't think I'm going to have dinner wi Linus. I don't want to go out with him. DAVID: Why not? SABRINA: I want to be near you. DAVID: Oh, I know how you feel, Sabrina. It must be an aw bore. But if Linus wants to take you out, let's be nice about it. It's very important. He's our only ally.

Next, cable Miss Show to get her a car in Paris, also an apartment. Next, a letter of credit on our Paris bank. She can draw up to 50,000. Easy, now. Next, transfer to Thomas Fairchild 1,000 shares, Larrabee Common. 1,000 shares?! Make it 1,500 shares, Larrabee Preferred.
