McCARDLE: Well, how about, uh, 3:30 this afternoon? DAVID: I want to see him now! McCARDLE: I'm sorry. I have my orders. He's working with lawyers on the plastics deal. DAVID: Miss McCardle, are you going to press that button, I'll break that door down using you as a battering ram! McCARDLE: Mr. David! DAVID: Make up your mind! Miss McCardle pushes the button, opening the door. Inside is talking with a number of lawyers. DAVID: Linus, I want to talk to you! LINUS: Ask Miss McCardle for an appointment. DAVID: Don't give me that appointment business! I'm mad! I'm really steamed. LINUS: All right, gentlemen, I'll be ten minutes. The lawyers leave the room. LINUS: Now, what's the trouble? DAVID: How did this get in the paper? LINUS: What? DAVID: "It looks like wedding bells for David Larrabee ag The girl is Elizabeth Tyson of the Oyster Bay Tysons." LINUS: Well, congratulations. DAVID: Did you plant this? LINUS: Me?! I thought it was common knowledge about you a Elizabeth Tyson. You like her, don't you? DAVID: 1 like her a lot. LINUS: Well? DAVID: 1 like a lot of girls a lot. LINUS: You can say that again. 12 DAVID: What are you gonna do with that gun? Linus shoots several times into a barrel. DAVID: Put that thing away, Linus! LINUS: Look at that. The greatest plastic ever made. Not ascratch on it. Say, I wonder how this would stand up against a bazooka. Miss McCardle, ask General Stanton on Governors Island and ask if we can borrow a bazooka. McCARDLE: Yes, Mr. Larrabee. DAVID: To get back to my problem, if you don't mind. LINUS: Lend me your lighter. DAVID: Get this straight, Linus. I have no intention of marrying Elizabeth Tyson! Linus holds a lighter under the plastic shield. LINUS: Doesn't burn, doesn't scorch, doesn't melt. How ab that! DAVID: Look, Linus. I've been married before. I've had it I've had it three times. LINUS: Yeah, but this is the first time the family approv because for once you're gonna settle down and do somethin constructive. Taste it. DAVID: What's so constructive about marrying Elizabeth Ty LINUS: Taste it. DAVID: It's sweet. LINUS: That's right. It's made of sugar cane. DAVID: Sugar cane. Wait a minute. This wouldn't have anyt to do with the fact the Tysons own the largest holdings o sugar cane in Puerto Rico, would it?! LINUS: Second largest. The largest have no daughter.

You make it sound so vulgar, David. As if the son of the hot-dog dynasty were being offered in marriage to the daughter of the mustard king. Surely, surely you don't object to Elizabeth just because her father happens to have 20 million dollars? That's very narrow-minded of you, David. Just one thing you overlooked. I haven't proposed, and she hasn't accepted. Oh, don't worry. I proposed, and Mr. Tyson accepted. Did you kiss him? Now look, David. Elizabeth is one of the loveliest girls around. Sooner or later you're gonna propose to her anyway. I'm only trying to help you make up your mind. Then why don't you marry her? Me? Well, what's so funny? You want to die an old maid? Well, I was just thinking that if I were able to get married, I'd have to take a Dictaphone, two secretaries and four corporation counselors along on the honeymoon. I'd be unfaithful to my wife every night of my married life with vice presidents, boards of directors, slide-rul accountants... This... this is my home. No wife would ever understand it. Well, neither can I. You've got all the money in the world. Well, what's money got to do with it? If making money were all there was to business, it'd hardly be worth whil going to the office. Money is a by-product. Well, what's the main objective? Power? Ah! That's become a dirty word. Well, then, what's the urge? You're going into plastics now. What will that prove? 14 LINUS: Prove? Nothing much. A new product has been found something of use to the world. A new industry moves into an undeveloped area. Factories go up. Machines are brough in. A harbor is dug, and you're in business. It's purely coincidental, of course, that people who've never seen a dime before, suddenly have a dollar. And barefooted kids wear shoes and have their teeth fixed and their faces was What's wrong with a kind of an urge that gives people libraries, hospitals, baseball diamonds and, uh, movies on a Saturday night? Miss McCardle, will you send in the secretaries? McCARDLE: Yes, Mr. Larrabee. DAVID: Now you make me feel like a heel. If I don't marry Elizabeth, some kid's gonna be running around Puerto Rico barefoot with cavities in his teeth. LINUS: Here. Look at this stuff. You'll fly in a plane ma of it. You'll wear a suit made of it and before we're through with it, you'll probably be able to eat it. We're organizing Larrabee Plastics. Larrabee Construction is ready with the blueprints. Larrabee Shipping bought nine more freighters to handle the traffic. DAVID: You mean the wheels are in motion already? LINUS: That's exactly what I mean. A number of secretaries walk into the room. LINUS: Now, would you mind demonstrating the weight test Mr. David, please? DAVID: Oh, Linus, I'll take your word for it. LINUS: Up you go. DAVID: Now, wait a minute. LINUS: I want you to see how resilient it is. Bounce, ple ladies. The secretaries bounce up and down. LINUS: Some plastic, eh? We're planning on a summer wedd so we can get in on this year's sugar crop. DAVID: Yeah. LINUS: I think you're gonna be very happy, David. 5. Love thy neighbor

No gentleman makes love to a servant in your mother's house! She is not a servant. She's a servant's daughter. And in behaving as you have, you've embarrassed not only your mother but also our chauffeur. I have too much respect for Fairchild never to intrude on his personal life, and I expect you to have the same respect for his daughter. I have so much respect for his daughter, I invited her to the party. 28

I still don't understand what those glasses were doing in your pocket? I was taking them down to the tennis court. There was somebody waiting. Er, there was a game going on. In the dark? In the middle of the night? Yes, that's why he needed the glasses. Yes, that's why I needed the glasses. 36 David slips through the hole and hits his buttocks on th DAVID: Ow! Oh! Oh, oh. ELIZABETH: Shall we play three-handed? LINUS: No, thanks. I've got to go sailing. DAVID: Yes, he's got to go sailing. LINUS: No more false moves now. Not until those stitches are out. DAVID: Yes, Linus. LINUS: We don't want any complications to set in, do we? So long, Elizabeth. So long, Scarface. Linus goes into his own bedroom. Oliver stands in the clo LINUS: Good afternoon, Father. OLIVER: I thought it was your mother. LINUS: I don't mind your smoking in my room, but not in m clothes closet. OLIVER: It's good for the moths. Now then, Linus, what ab that girl over the garage? LINUS: David wants to run off with her. OLIVER: That's nice. With the chauffeur's daughter? LINUS: I don't care if he runs off with gardener's grandm Ijust don't want him to run off with the plastics merger. OLIVER: I've got a very simple solution. We'll fire Fairc LINUS: Not after 25 years, Father. OLIVER: All right then, we'll write her a nice little che tell her to forget about David. LINUS: She doesn't want money. She wants love. OLIVER: I thought they discontinue that model. LINUS: The last of the romantics. L'amour, toujours l'amo OLIVER: What? Why does she have to pick on David? Why can she be in love with someone else? LINUS: We will do our best. OLIVER: Oh, oh, Is that the idea? LINUS: Yep. 37 OLIVER: You've got someone in mind for her? LINUS: Yep. OLIVER: Who? LINUS: Boola, boola, Boola, boola, Boola, boola, Boo... OLIVER: Oh, no! LINUS: What's the matter? OLIVER: Not you, Linus! LINUS: Hey, look, do you think this is any fun for me? I' got a whole desk full of work I was planning to clean up over the weekend, and I'm supposed to be in Texas on the sulphur deal. The whole Puerto Rican operation has to be set in motion in the next 48 hours. And here I am going off to a sailboat to make an ass of myself, with a girl of 22. Look at me! Joe College, with a touch of arthritis. OLIVER: Could you use this, sailing into the sunset? Oliver pulls a broken ukulele from the closet. LINUS: I wish I were dead with my back broken. OLIVER: Just a thought. LINUS: Music might help. Seems to me I had a portable phonograph in my freshman days. OLIVER: I only hope you remember what to do with a girl. LINUS: It'll come back to me. It's like riding a bicycle.

Got that? Next. Here's the itinerary for tonight I want two tickets to The Seven Year Itch. Table for two at The Colony before the show, a table for two at The Persian Room after the show. Make it a corner table, a dark corner. We're just passing La Guardia Field. You can put the coffee on in 10 minutes and make it strong. LINUS: Fairchild, I'll be needing you tonight. FAIRCHILD: Yes, sir. LINUS: I'm taking Sabrina out again. FAIRCHILD: Yes, sir. LINUS: Would you have her at my office at seven o'clock? FAIRCHILD: Yes, sir. LINUS: Anything wrong, Fairchild? FAIRCHILD: I would very much prefer that you would dispen my services on these dates with my daughter, sir. It make for a rather awkward situation. LINUS: Oh, I see. That never occurred to me. I'm sorry. FAIRCHILD: It's just not right, sir. I like to think of l alimousine. Though we're all driving together, we must remember our places. There's a front seat, a back seat and a window in between. LINUS: Fairchild, I never realized it before, but you're terrible snob. FAIRCHILD: Yes, sir. LINUS: All right. Have her take one of other cars and dri in herself. Have her take David's car. FAIRCHILD: Thank you, sir. It's all so distressing. First David, now you. I wish Sabrina would've stayed in Paris. LINUS: So do 1. 41 FAIRCHILD: May I ask, sir, what exactly are your intenti LINUS: My intentions? Unethical, reprehensible but very practical. FAIRCHILD: I beg your pardon? LINUS: With your permission, Fairchild, I'm shipping your daughter back to Paris. FAIRCHILD: You are, sir? LINUS: That is, I'm going to try to ship her back. FAIRCHILD: May I ask how, sir? LINUS: First class, of course. And I don't want you to worry about money. FAIRCHILD: It's not money I'm worried about, sir. It's Sa I just don't want her to get hurt. LINUS: I'll be as gentle as I can. FAIRCHILD: IThope so, sir. She's just a displaced person, afraid. She doesn't belong in a mansion, but then again she doesn't belong above a garage either.

As the chairman of the board, I would like to say at the outset ... the chairman is so dizzy. LINUS: Meeting adjourned. Have a frozen daiquiri. SABRINA: I once saw an office like this in an old copy of Fortune magazine at my dentist's. Has David got an office like this? LINUS: Something like this, only larger. SABRINA: Larger? LINUS: Oh, yes. Instead of a desk, he has a putting green 42 Linus hands a daiquiri to Sabrina.

LINUS: Oh, never resist an impulse, Sabrina, especially i it's terrible. SABRINA: I'm going to do it. Sabrina grabs Linus's hat and turns its brim down. SABRINA: There. LINUS: What's that for? SABRINA: We can't have you walking up and down the Champs looking like a tourist undertaker. And another thing, never a briefcase in Paris and never an umbrella. There's a law. LINUS: How am I ever going to get along in Paris without like you? Who'll be there to help me with my French? To turn down the brim of my hat? SABRINA: Suppose you meet someone on the boat, the very f A perfect stranger. LINUS: I have a better suppose, Sabrina. Suppose I were t years younger. Suppose you weren't in love with David. Suppose I asked you to ... Oh, I suppose I'm just talkin nonsense. SABRINA: I suppose so. LINUS: Suppose you sing that song again. Slowly. SABRINA: (singing in French)

LINUS: We saw The Seven Year Itch and went on to The Pers Room. DAVID: Lousy dancer, isn't he? SABRINA: So-so. DAVID: I bet he slept through half the show and then bent your ears back the rest of the evening with Dow Jones averages, corporate structures, excess-profits taxes. SABRINA: We talked about a lot of things. LINUS: How's your little, er, mishap? DAVID: Shaping up beautifully. Dr. Calaway's so proud of job he wants to show it to his class at Columbia medical school. (to Sabrina) Oh, I'm sorry, Sabrina. SABRINA: It's very funny. DAVID: Say, Linus, while I was lying in that hammock, I g a great idea. (to Sabrina) He thinks I'm an idiot. (to Linus) How does this strike you? Plastic champagne glasses out of plastic just in case. LINUS: Brilliant. What else did Dr. Calloway have to say? DAVID: Mmm, stitches come out Thursday. LINUS: Thursday? 46 DAVID: I'm a fast healer. LINUS: You sure are. DAVID: So if you two have long-range plans... LINUS: No. Nothing long range. I, I just thought Sabrina' like to see the stock exchange and our plant in Jersey.

Linus turns the brim of his hat back up. LINUS: I guess the undertaker had better turn in, and you better crawl back into that hole in your hammock. Au revoir, Sabrina. SABRINA: Good night, Linus. DAVID: He's a little on the dull side, isn't he? But you can't help liking him. SABRINA: Kiss me, David. DAVID: I'd love to, Sabrina. SABRINA: Again. ... That's better. DAVID: What's the matter, darling? You're not worried abo us, aren't you? I'mnot. There'll be a big stink in the family. Who cares? SABRINA: David, I don't think I'm going to have dinner wi Linus. I don't want to go out with him. DAVID: Why not? SABRINA: I want to be near you. DAVID: Oh, I know how you feel, Sabrina. It must be an aw bore. But if Linus wants to take you out, let's be nice about it. It's very important. He's our only ally. Don't you see, Father will try to cut off my allowance and send me to Larrabee Copper in Butte, Montana. And we don't want to go to Butte, Montana, do we?
