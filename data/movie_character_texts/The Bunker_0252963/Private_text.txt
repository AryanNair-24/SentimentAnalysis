Dim work-lights are strung along the roof, but barely illuminate the scene. An emergency generator CLATTERS awa somewhere in the b.g.

PRIVATE emerges from th gloom of the main tunnel, jogging towards them. He slows a halt as he joins his two comrades, and begins to quickl fill them in.

But the other two turn and RUN.
