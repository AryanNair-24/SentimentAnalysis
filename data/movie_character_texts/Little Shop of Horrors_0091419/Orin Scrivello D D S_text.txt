Orin tosses his head summoning Audrey to follow. She sneaks one miserable, trapped glance at Seymour, then forces herself to join Orin on the motorcycle. As Orin REVS it up we see, on the cycle, a decal insignia of a tooth stuck with a dagger and the letters. "A.D.A." Orin calls back to Audrey over the ROAR OF THE ENGINE. ORIN (cont.)

HISSING SOUNDS. Orin immediately begins to get high and giggle. He is laughing so hard now, he has to hold onto a countertop for support. This turns his back toward Seymour. ORIN (cont.)

Seymour closes his eyes and clenches his teeth, trying to make himself shoot. ORIN (cont.) A gun. (exploding with laughter, then talking through it with difficulty) The kid's got a goddamn revolver! (more laughter) Jesus, I'm in trouble, huh? He giggles hysterically as he turns the gas knob. It comes off in his hand. The HISSING SOUND continues. This strikes him funny. ORIN (cont.) Uh oh... Laughs. Seymour keeps the gun pointed, trying to force himself to actually pull the trigger. Orin makes an attempt to get the mask off, but he can barely get his arms up to his head. He's too weak from the gas and the laughter. ORIN (cont.) Oh boy... uh... Uh... Seymour, give me a hand, would ya? Er... no, I guess you wouldn't. He laughs. He tries to pull the hose out of the wall. The entire gas apparatus comes with it, sending Orin crashing to the floor. The HISSING CONTINUES. (CONTINUED)

With business drooping lower than his Creeping Charlie, Mushnik has decided to throw in the trowel and lay off hi only two employees, the klutzy orphan Seymour and brave, battered Audrey. Then Seymour purchases a strange and int esting plant from an ancient Mandarin during a total ecli of the sun. And business blooms. Customers converge on the shabby premises, attracted by the odd potted pod in the window. Christening his priz Audrey II in honor of his secret love, Seymour showers it with mulch, gro-light and affection. But, as it develops, there's only one type of nourishment that Audrey II craves--and it's not available at your loc nursery! The Geffen Company presents a Frank Oz Film, "Little Shop of Horrors," released by The Geffen Company through Bros. Produced by David Geffen and directed by Frank Oz, monster musical comedy stars Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene a Vineent Gardenia, with a special appearance by Steve Mart -more- "LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS" - Production Information ~2- and cameo appearances by John Candy, James Belushi and Christopher Guest. The screenplay and lyrics were written by Howard Ashman and the music composed by Alan Menken, who collab- orated on the off-Broadway and Londen stage hit on which the movie is based. The stage hit, which has since blossomed into a perennial, was inspired by Roger Corman's "Grade 2" horro film of the same title. Shot in 1960 on an unbelievable schedule of two days and a night (largely because Corman offered a storefront left over from another movie), "Litt Shop of Horrors" went on to become a cult classic. It was also notable for the brief, bizarre appearance of relative newcomer Jack Nicholson as a masochistic dent patient. New York theatre critics gave the stage production of “Little Shop of Horrors" a blue ribbon reception. The New Yorker's Edith Oliver hailed it as "a musical comedy that is both musical and comic... full of surprises and marvel effects." Richard Corliss in Time magazine welcomed "a carnivore with its own intimidating charm" which "envelop the stage and (gasp!) most of the audience." Winning the Drama Critics' Circle, Drama Desk and Outer Critics' Circle Awards as the season's best musical the show spawned an American touring company (which is st going strong), a two-year London run, and productions in France, Scandinavia, Israel, Japan, Germany, Australia an ~more- "LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS" ~ Production Information -3- Iceland. With the acquisition of the screen rights by the David Geffen Company, the voracious Venus people~trap had blossomed thrice. Geffen's goal was to fuse the elements of the original story and the show into its own unique entity. The time-frame, he decided, would remain intact. Downtown, it is still 1960. Here, Seymour Krelborn (RICK MORANIS) toils slavishly for Mushnik (VINCENT GARDENIA), who plucked him "as a tyke" from the Skid Row Home for Homeless Boys. In his basement bedroom, where he raises exotic foliage, Seymour pines for Audrey (ELLEN GREENE), the lithe, blonde salesgirl with the Betty Boop voice and cinema noir wardrobe. But Audrey is literally a prisoner of love. Her steady crush--in more ways than one--is Orin Scrivello (STEVE MARTIN), a biker dentist whose delight for burning rubber is only exceeded by his joy for inflicting pain. When he isn't giving root canals a bad name or getting hi on his own nitrous oxide, Scrivello spends most of his ti putting Audrey in traction. One night, in the depths of Mushnik's cellar, Seymour pricks his finger on a rose~-and Audrey II gets her first slurp of RH negative. Audrey II grows. Seymour grows anemic. Audrey II demands more "sticky, licky sweets." Seymour buys more Band-Aids. If Mushnik's prosperity and his exhausted -more- "LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS" - Production Information -4- errand boy are both to survive, fresh blood must be added to the floral food chain... For director Frank Oz, the challenge of "Little Shop of Horrors" was "deceptive." The project, he says, “looke simple, but wasn't. If we played it too camp, the audienc wouldn't care about the characters. If we were too straig we'd veer toward melodrama." What evolved was what Oz calls "heightened reality." In opening the stage show to encompass the littered alley decrepit tenements and end-of-the-line elevated train of Mushnik's neighborhood, he and Oscar-winning production d signer Roy Walker created a fantasy Skid Row. But within the sprawling set--which consumed every square inch of Pinewood Studios' "007" stage (the largest in the world)- also sought a certain "intimacy." "I didn't want to balloon it into a musical ‘War and ” Peace' or even a big, splashy '40s extravaganza," says th director. "There are no dizzying overhead crane shots. No irrelevant dance numbers. Nothing to overwhelm what is basically the simple story of a boy, a girl and a man-eat plant." Several production numbers, however, display amusing affection for film lore. The hollow-eyed vagrants, shuffl through the gutters of "Downtown," recall Busby Berkeley' Depression-era classic, "My Forgotten Man." "Somewhere That's Green" is a paean to the suburban never-never land scores of movies and ‘60s sitcoms. -more- "LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS" - Production Information -5- Within the “heightened reality," Oz and Geffen gathered a colorfully incongruous cast. Seymour is played by Rick Moranis, one of the Canadian ' who Second City troupe's non-fraternal "McKenzie Brothers,' breezed through "Ghostbusters" as Sigourney Weaver's rand next-door nebbish. His "Little Shop..." role as a botanic body snatcher required "more straight acting than anythin I'd done before," says Moranis. "But the real attraction the chance to sing. Until now, I'd been limited mostly to parody." Ellen Greene, on the other hand, knew the role of Audrey "Like a second skin," having played it for two yea in New York, Los Angeles and London. (Time magazine prais her portrayal of "a sweet, sexy, slightly dizzy blonde wi an Elmer Fudd lisp, wittle-girl wiles" and a voice that “buckles theatre walls.") Her character, comments Greene, first came into focus during costume fittings for the off-Broadway show. "We we through about five wigs before Audrey became a cornsilk blonde," she explains. Next came the low-cut leopard skin dresses, stiletto heels and jangling of the B-movie heroi who were Audrey's role models. Vincent Gardenia insists that he was chosen as Mushnik because "Frank Oz liked my name.” The Naples-born actor, who began his career as a teenager playing old men in New Yor Italian theatre, calls Mushnik "a symphony of frustration He's a man trying to cling to the past despite the deprav ~more- "LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS" - Production Information -6- building around him." At the root of much of that depravity is Steve Martin's Doctor Scrivello. (Call him anything other than "Doctor" he'll joyfully rip your eyeteeth out.) As the leather-cla “leader of the plaque," Scrivello parks his Harley Davids
