When he hears the voice, Kirill glances at his father and moves quickly out of earshot. Semyon notices but hides his concern. As Kirill walks, a child tugs his leg and holds up a soft toy, asking a question in Russian.
23) 8) text: Kirill glances over at Semyon, who is apparently lost amongst a sea of children, but we see from the corner of his eye he is watching Kirill.

35) 18) text: Nikolai reaches into his pocket for a business card and offers it to Semyon. As Semyon looks at the card in the candle light, he also sees the TATTOO OF AN EAGLE on Nikolai's hand. It is obvious that the tattoo means more than the card to Semyon, and he reacts.
35) 25) text: I think you and I could do business together. A pause.   Semyon looks at Nikolai with utter contempt.

47) 23) dialog: So... perhaps we can do a deal. He stares into her eyes.
47) 24) dialog: Do you understand me, Anna? At that moment a nurse walks by and hesitates when she sees Semyon.

53) 35) dialog: And also... the KGB would be waiting for me. Nikolai smiles ruefully and glances at Semyon.
