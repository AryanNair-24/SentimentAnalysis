52) 17) dialog: It works you know. You drink blood  the right time of the moon... they  used to dance in the forests naked.  I think that's what offended the  Puritans and led to the Burnings.  They were a sexual threat to their  male order like the Bacchae -- five  days a year for Dionysus, they used  to wander the hills in ancient Greece,  the first witches, clans of wild  women fucking, looting, eating animals  raw, the wine in their blood running  hot -- looking for Dionysus... to  tear him to pieces -- isn't that  wild?

The Great Jim Morrison, The Shaman, then Pamela, Patricia Gloria, a series of women who face after face fill the an gallery, interchangeable masks as PEOPLE ARE STRANGE clim and JIM's face SPINS OUT OPTICALLY TO:

62) 20) dialog: Don't ever try to hide anything from  me again. Okay? Go on... tell me.  Did he make you cut your hair? Did  he hit you, was he a bully? Did he  love you? How much?
62) 22) dialog: And your mother?
62) 25) text: His look is right at her. Silence. Patricia knows he won' talk. Through the pause we hear the crowd chanting, bigge and bigger -- "MORRISON MORRISON MORRISON!" She's excited wanting to make love here, now. He's cooled out, however.
62) 26) dialog: It doesn't matter anymore does it.  Listen to them. It's you they want  now. Not the Doors, not your mother  or your father's child... They want  you Jim.

102) 5) dialog: It'd be a fucking genius, that's  what it'd be! You and me. The child  would be a god, goddess!
102) 9) dialog: You're a COWARD!! A LITTLE BOY!! The  only way you can't afford it is  emotionally. You forgot your vows  man. They were forever in the goddess'  sight. Death doesn't part, only love  Jim!
