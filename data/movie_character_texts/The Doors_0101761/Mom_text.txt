Mom's a beauty and Dad's an austere handsome military man civilian clothes, mouthing words -- look, wake them up, a desert storm... but we barely hear A LIGHTNING BOLT shreds the blue sky with a thunderous so frightening dawn of creation... Grandma nudging Jim awake. His eyes open -- Just as the car turns the bend -- revealing An overturned TRUCK lying in the road -- dead and wounded INDIANS everywhere... A cop car, ambulance. A terrible  accident... The first thing Jim sees... An old INDIAN FACE staring at him... The car pulling alongside, Dad rolling his window down... asking if he can help (SOUNDLESS) A line of wailing INDIA

20) 49) text: Jim has crouched, digging his hand in the sand. As the gr spill out of his fist he has his eyes closed. Ray pantomimes chords in the keyboard sand. All of a sudd we're in RAY'S POV -- a mystical moment. Jim singing, no  sound, then pure song, unadulterated by atmosphere.

55) 49) text: A moment, strange. Slightly SLOW MOTION. Ray tapping Jim' shoulder goodbye... Robbie and John's faces passing on. A if they're parting -- in a symbolic way. Jim blinking in same SLOW MOTION, looking. Nico is gone -- but Tom is the across the room, waving. The INDIAN SHAMAN looks like he's standing there in a cor Jim, ripped, heads for him, but the PR WOMAN cuts him off Jim forgets he saw the Indian.

88) 44) text: The others all look away embarrassed. This is certainly a moment the ordinary partner might turn away from Pamela, tears running, but her pathacy, her inability to deal wit pain is precisely what moves Jim the most -- a side of hi in her -- an ultimate weakness she has, he shares. As he  goes to her, puts his arms gently around her.

A moment, only three, four beats. An optical  illusion? Maybe. Or is it saying, 'now you are just a whi man'... maybe not. As it drifts off in a cloud, into the  vast audience's EYEBALL.
