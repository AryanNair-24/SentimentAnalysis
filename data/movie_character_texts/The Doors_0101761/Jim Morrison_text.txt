Curious, oblong  figures, buffalo, sacred deer and bear, creatures of the  hunt; hunters and their weapons, rain clouds, masked deit proclaiming the answers to the Mysteries, the story of  Creation. Camera weaving up to see one of the faces of the deities staring at him from the wall -- an eagle's face...
34) 3) text: The voice, the pretense, -- the glow too quickly fades -- leaving Jim so alone, not sure what he has heard, yet he  knows he has heard, and he knows he has seen -- and once have seen, it will never be the same again. His eyes.

He literally tortu Jim's ears with his drums. And RAY, concentrated with his nodding head like a big  flamingo over his keyboard, mixing it up, throwing curves yet also -- and more delicately -- torturing Jim with the messianic organ sounds that shriek in his ears. There is  something of Merlin in Ray -- the alchemist knowing how t play Jim. And JIM -- "that sneaky silent lithe flowing flexing anim ready at last to share both his body and his soul with th world, to live out the words of the Indian prophet... to  lead.

36) 12) text: The SCREAMS primal, pure Jim -- Indian savagery ripped fr the depths of his soul, of his pain -- bouncing off the  walls... As the AUDIENCE gasps, shocked, stunned...

Like the gunfight who has killed his first man. RAY sees it instantly where it's going, hits the organ! R and John follow. the instruments EXPLODE all at once tryi to bury Jim in his primal unmistakeable scream. The CLUB in shock. Tribal taboo broken in one instant. Je exploding off the balcony toward the stage... Pamela, extremely moved and impressed, and Dorothy... the go girls, as jaded as they come, are stunned tension... t groupies love it. Jim has jumped up now, dancing an Indian war dance around the mike.

(pause) a fake hero... a joke the gods played  on me... it's okay, I accept the  joke... and smile. Death old friend,  death and my cock, I can forgive my  injuries in the name of wisdom,  luxury, romance. Words got me the  wound and will get me well.
