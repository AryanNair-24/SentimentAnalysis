51) 16) dialog: The difference is huge.
51) 18) dialog: No. Pot bellies make a man look either  oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a  woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The  rest of you is normal. Normal face,  normal legs, normal hips, normal  ass, but with a big, perfectly round  pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a  tee-shirt two sizes too small to  accentuate it.
51) 20) dialog: I don't give a damn what men find  attractive. It's unfortunate what we  find pleasing to the touch and  pleasing to the eye is seldom the  same.

51) 43) dialog: We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?
51) 45) dialog: If they find us, they'll kill us,  won't they?
51) 47) dialog: But they won't find us, will they?
51) 49) dialog: Do you still want me to go with you?
51) 51) dialog: I don't want to be a burden or a  nuisance -

51) 73) dialog: Don't call me retard.
51) 75) dialog: Shut up fuck head! I hate that  Mongoloid voice.
51) 77) dialog: Oh I like that, I like being called  a tulip. Tulip is much better than  Mongoloid.
51) 82) dialog: Butch?
51) 84) dialog: Where are we going to go?
51) 86) dialog: So if we wanted, we could live in  Bora Bora?
51) 88) dialog: But I do not speak Spanish.
51) 90) dialog: What does that mean?
51) 92) dialog: Donde esta el zapataria?
51) 94) text: Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brus her teeth. Butch keeps on from the other room.
51) 96) dialog: Que hora es?
51) 98) dialog: What time is it?

51) 101) dialog: Butch.
51) 103) dialog: Forget it.
51) 108) dialog: Merde! You startled me. Did you have  a bad dream?

51) 125) dialog: Well, let's look at the grumpy man  in the morning. I didn't say you  were lying, it's just odd you don't  remember your dreams. I always  remember mine. Did you know you talk  in your sleep?
51) 127) dialog: You did last night.
51) 130) dialog: I don't know. I couldn't understand  you.
51) 132) dialog: Why don't you get up and we'll get  some breakfast at that breakfast  place with the pancakes.
51) 134) text: Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.
51) 135) dialog: Satisfied?
51) 137) dialog: Then get up, lazy bones.
51) 138) text: Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the suitcase that Fabienne brought.
51) 140) dialog: Almost nine in the morning. What  time does our train arrive?
51) 142) dialog: I'm gonna order a big plate of  blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,  eggs over easy, and five sausages.
51) 145) dialog: (referring to his  clothes) Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a  tall glass or orange juice and a  black cup of coffee. After that, I'm  going to have a slice of pie.

51) 179) dialog: Why does it mean that?
51) 181) dialog: Won't the gangsters be looking for  you there?
51) 184) dialog: I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,  I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.
51) 187) dialog: Don't go.
