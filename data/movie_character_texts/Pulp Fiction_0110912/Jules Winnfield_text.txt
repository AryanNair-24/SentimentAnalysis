6) 29) dialog: Look, just because I wouldn't give  no man a foot massage, don't make it  right for Marsellus to throw Antwan  off a building into a glass- motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the  way the nigger talks. That ain't  right, man. Motherfucker do that to  me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause  I'd kill'a motherfucker.

Blessed is  he who, in the name of charity and  good will, shepherds the weak through  the valley of darkness, for he is  truly his brother's keeper and the  finder of lost children.

91) 4) dialog: I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig  on swine.
91) 6) dialog: They're filthy animals. I don't eat  filthy animals.
91) 8) dialog: A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin  pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if  it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy  motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in  shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't  wanna eat nothin' that ain't got  enough sense to disregard its own  feces.
91) 10) dialog: I don't eat dog either.
91) 12) dialog: I wouldn't go so far as to call a  dog filthy, but they're definitely  dirty. But a dog's got personality.  And personality goes a long way.
91) 14) dialog: We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one  motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd  have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.
91) 17) dialog: I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

91) 23) dialog: What's an act of God?
91) 25) dialog: Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't  matter. You're judging this thing  the wrong way. It's not about what.  It could be God stopped the bullets,  he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found  my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge  shit like this based on merit. Whether  or not what we experienced was an  according-to-Hoyle miracle is  insignificant. What is significant  is I felt God's touch, God got  involved.
91) 27) dialog: That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I  don't know why. But I can't go back  to sleep.
91) 29) dialog: The life, most definitely.

91) 36) dialog: You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU."  Just walk from town to town, meet  people, get in adventures.
91) 38) dialog: Until God puts me where he want me  to be.
91) 40) dialog: If it takes forever, I'll wait  forever.
91) 42) dialog: I'll just be Jules, Vincent В– no  more, no less.
91) 44) dialog: Look my friend, this is just where  me and you differ В–
91) 46) dialog: All shapes and sizes, Vince.
91) 48) dialog: If you find my answers frightening,  Vincent, you should cease askin'  scary questions.
91) 50) text: Vincent exits for the restroom. Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

93) 4) text: Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a poi Pumpkin points to the briefcase.
93) 6) dialog: My boss' dirty laundry.
93) 8) dialog: When he wants it clean.
93) 10) dialog: Funny, I've been thinkin' the same  thing.
93) 12) text: Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.
93) 13) dialog: 'Fraid I can't do that.
93) 14) text: Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims th gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the hammer.

93) 87) dialog: There's a passage I got memorized.  Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the  righteous man is beset on all sides  by the inequities of the selfish and  the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is  he who, in the name of charity and  good will, shepherds the weak through  the valley of the darkness. For he  is truly his brother's keeper and  the finder of lost children. And I  will strike down upon thee with great  vengeance and furious anger those  who attempt to poison and destroy my  brothers. And you will know I am the  Lord when I lay my vengeance upon  you." I been sayin' that shit for  years.  And if you ever heard it, it  meant your ass. I never really  questioned what it meant. I thought  it was just a coldblooded thing to  say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped  a cap in his ass. But I saw some  shit this mornin' made me think twice.  Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're  the evil man. And I'm the righteous  man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the  shepherd protecting my righteous ass  in the valley of darkness. Or is  could by you're the righteous man  and I'm the shepherd and it's the  world that's evil and selfish.  I'd  like that. But that shit ain't the  truth. The truth is you're the weak.  And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But  I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to  be a shepherd.
