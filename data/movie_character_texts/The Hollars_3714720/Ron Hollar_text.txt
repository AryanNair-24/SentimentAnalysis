Heavy set and motherly with lines of distinction on her face. She takes a breath and faces herself in the mirror. A troubled look flutters across her eyes.

The song continues as actually sung by the Indigo Girls as Jason wheels Sally out of the room. Sally smiles and mouths a “thank you” to Don. Don grabs her hand for a moment, then lets her go. Rebecca gives John a kiss on the cheek.
