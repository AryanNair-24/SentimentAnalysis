4) 4) text: MR. GASKET (cont'd) It's punks like you the paramedics end up scraping off the roads at four in the morning. (beat) For your own sake and the safety of others, I hope you fail your driver's exam. Les gets up to leave. Gasket signals to stay, then throws him a piece of chalk. Les rolls his eyes.
34) 8) dialog: Anderson. I want you to take a long hard look at that cup of coffee. Now I love my coffee. It may be the only thing I truly cherish on this god forsaken mudball we call earth. What I'm trying to say is that most inspectors use a checklist. (holding up the clipboard) I don't believe in them. (he throws it out the window) What I do believe in, is my cup of coffee. You see, that coffee is hot, filled right to the brim. If it spills on me it'll probably burn me. And no one likes to get burned. So, if you burn me, you fail. If you don't, you pass. It's as simple as that. (beat) Whenever you're ready.
34) 14) dialog: (o.s., drill sergeant) Make a left at the intersection, Anderson.
44) 3) dialog: You're in luck, Anderson. The cup was empty. See you on the battlefield sometime. Les, grateful, would love to hug Mr. Kelly.
