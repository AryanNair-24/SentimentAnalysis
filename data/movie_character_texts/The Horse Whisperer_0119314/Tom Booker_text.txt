53) 1) dialog: ... It's always kind of interesting to  hear the horse's side of the story... The crowd laughs warmly. He directs his comments to a WOM wearing an expensive Ralph Lauren western outfit, standin outside the corral...
53) 2) dialog: Now if he was cranky or lazy, like you  say he is, we'd be seeing his tail  twitching there and his ears back,  maybe. But this isn't a cranky horse,  it's a scared horse. You see how braced  he is up around the neck back there.  He just doesn't know which way to turn... The Woman nods. Tom turns the horse on a dime so that he  always stays facing the circling thoroughbred...
53) 3) dialog: You see how he keeps pointing his  hindquarters in at me? Well, I'd guess  the reason he seems reluctant to move  out is because when he does, he gets in  trouble for it.

Making the animal go from a tro a lope, letting it slow, then up to a lope again.
53) 12) dialog: I want him to get so he can leave real  soft. He's getting the idea now. He's  not all braced up and tense like he was  at the start. He's finding out it's okay. He throws the rope again and this time the transition to lope is a smooth one.
53) 13) dialog: You see that? He's getting better  already. Pretty soon, if you work at  it, you'll be able to make all these  transitions easy on a loose rein. (sotto voce, wry)

Feeling better, and not a little attracted to his heartfe man's man, the Woman smiles and reaches for his hand to c over the rail. Her horse lets her come right up to him an stroke his neck. Tom comments;

See, I knew she was never  going to be a ranchest, but I wanted  to try -- I thought maybe she'd give  music lessons to the kids in town or at  the school, maybe even recitals. My son  would grow up here. Maybe have one or  two more. I'd teach 'em what I could.  They'd play with my brother's kids. All  grow up together. And even if they all  decided to go out into the world, they'd  always know where home was -- cause we'd  keep it for 'em...
124) 21) dialog: Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean  everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're  from, where you belong, what feeds you,  where you can go no matter what happens...  Knowing what you're supposed to be doing  while you're here.
