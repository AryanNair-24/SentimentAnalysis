89) 14) dialog: You know Courtney? Girl with the dyed black hair and the nose ring? Wears Hot Topic every day?
89) 16) dialog: We used to be best friends growing up, but we've kinda grown apart. She sorta got all emo. She thinks I'm a prep. But, I still consider her a friend! Anyway, she cut one of her wrists. I don't know how bad, but I think I should go visit. Jill glances down at the book in Mason's hand.
89) 17) dialog: So what are you reading?

89) 21) dialog: I tried... but it was so cheesy!   So how do you like San Marcos?

89) 36) dialog: But don't tell LeeAnn I told you that. She'd kill me.
