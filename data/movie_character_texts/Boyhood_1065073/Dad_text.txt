102) 2) dialog: Hey!   How you doing?
102) 5) dialog: That's our car.    Hop on in there.
104) 1) dialog: (to Jim) Hey listen, uh, thanks for that camera you got Mason.
104) 3) dialog: He's loving that thing.
104) 5) dialog: Yeah, I know.
104) 7) dialog: Yeah?   You alright with that?
104) 9) dialog: Yeah... Right... Well...
104) 11) dialog: At least he's focusing on something.
104) 13) dialog: You know?     That's what I like.
106) 1) dialog: You're doing a nice job with the house though, it's looking great... really great.
106) 3) dialog: (laughs) Yeah. Right? Mason walks outside, carrying a duffel bag.
106) 4) dialog: Hey bud!     Hey, Happy Birthday! The mini-van catches Mason's attention.
106) 7) dialog: What's that?     That's our new car! Get in it. Dad gives Mason a hug.    Jim shakes Mason's hand.
106) 10) dialog: Hey, how you doing?      Good to see you.
106) 18) dialog: Alright!
106) 21) dialog: We got a big drive ahead of us.
106) 24) dialog: Alright.     Well, we'll be back tomorrow night.
107) 2) dialog: Yeah, no...     But I had to sell that anyway.
107) 4) dialog: Yeah, I had to sell that.
107) 6) dialog: Yeah, some sucker collector from California paid twenty-two grand for it, which is great 'cause I basically got to pay for this in cash. I only paid eighty-five hundred for that thing way back when. I mean, you know, cars are generally a terrible investment. You know? Soon as you drive them off the lot you got a used car on your hands, and the value's only dropping from there.
107) 9) dialog: But... if you take care of it, you know, and you get lucky and it's a classic, you know, the value starts going up again. I mean shit, you got guys paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for some Shelby Cobra. After a long silence, Dad notices Mason is unusually quie
107) 10) dialog: What?
107) 12) dialog: Remember what?
107) 14) dialog: (laughs) What? No, I didn't.       I never said that.
107) 16) dialog: What are you..? Alright, first off, I have no memory of that, alright? Second of all, I would never say that. Never.
107) 18) dialog: What? Mason. Come on, what about your sister? I'm just gonna forget about her? Come on, how's that fair? Huh? Anthony Nagar, what the?
107) 21) dialog: (laughs) Are you...? Oh, come on! I mean, you're not... Ughh. Look, you can sit there like there's a death in the family, alright, but bottom line is that was my car. Alright? I paid for it, I took care of it, and I can do whatever I want with it. Alright? I'm sorry if you had other ideas about it but when you get older you can save up and buy a car of your own. And be cool like I used to be. Or... you can get a mini-van. Annie and Samantha watch a Lady Gaga music video on Saman cell phone in the back seat.
107) 34) dialog: Hey, hey, Annie? Will you get me the, the little birthday present for Mason?
107) 36) dialog: Alright. This one, this one needs a little explanation, okay? Open it up. I call that "The Beatles' Black Album". Alright, what it is, is the best of John, Paul, George, and Ringo solo, post-break up.
107) 38) dialog: Yeah, basically, I put the band back together for you. Annie Laughs.
107) 39) dialog: You know, whenever you listen to too much of the solo stuff, it kind of becomes a drag, you know? But you put 'em next to each other, alright, and they start to elevate each other... and then you can hear it. Huh! It's The Beatles. You know?
107) 41) dialog: It doesn't matter, you know, you're missing the point. There is no favorite Beatle! That's what I'm saying. It's in the balance. That's what made them the greatest fucking rock band in the world. Okay? You know, and there's this decade of music out there that's been scattered. Alright?
107) 44) dialog: And now it has been carefully found, arranged, and ordered for you, by your loving father.
107) 46) dialog: Yes, yes, yes. So, I mean, look at that-- look at that, uh, top of Volume II, first four tracks... You've got "Band on the Run" into "My Sweet Lord", into "Jealous Guy", into "Photograph". I mean, come on. It's like the perfect segue. You got Paul, who takes you to the party, George who talks to you about God, John who says no, it's about love and pain, and then Ringo who just says hey, can't we enjoy what we have while we have it? It's a good record. I shit you not.
108) 1) dialog: Hey there, Cliff.
108) 3) dialog: Oh, good.   How you doin'?
108) 6) dialog: Ah, it's great to see you.
108) 9) dialog: Yeah, we sure did.    We sure did.
109) 1) dialog: Alright, we ready?
110) 1) dialog: Hey, Sam. He subtly indicates for her to get off her laptop and joi the family. They take their seats in the living room.
110) 2) dialog: Hey, still sleeping here?
110) 4) dialog: You ready? The family sings happy birthday to Mason. Nana brings in the birthday cake, complete with lit candles.
110) 6) dialog: Make a wish, make a wish. Mason blows out the candles. The family cheers.
110) 9) dialog: Hey Sam, would you get us a knife so we can cut this up? Hey? Alright. Sam walks into the kitchen to grab a knife.
110) 17) dialog: It's not going to make all your dreams come true, here, you know. Just keep your expectations low. No, no, no, no, you need it. It's... Dad pulls a blue dress shirt, blazer, and tie out of the box.
110) 18) dialog: It's -- hey! Come, on right? You gotta have it. You need this.
110) 21) dialog: You've got life ahead of you.   You know --
110) 23) dialog: You've got dances --
110) 25) dialog: -- And job interviews. Here, I'm going to get it all wrinkled here. Grandpa comes out of the kitchen with a covered gun.
110) 27) dialog: (whispers) The Black Album was from me.
111) 0) text: Samantha holds a pistol, ready to shoot. Dad is helping h aim. There are bottles and cans lined up as targets.
111) 1) dialog: Now cock it. Alright, there you go. Now, what you want to do is line up the front sight with the back sight, here, you see this little V right here --
111) 3) dialog: Now which one you aiming at?
111) 5) dialog: The middle can? Alright, alright. Now fire at will, alright?
111) 7) dialog: Ho.   Whoa! Dad claps as Samantha lowers the pistol.
111) 10) dialog: Alright, watch out, watch out.   Whoa. Be careful. Alright.
112) 0) text: The family sits out on the porch in a circle.   Dad plays guitar as the family sings along.
112) 1) dialog: (singing) Well, I want for us to be together forever.
112) 4) dialog: (singing) I want you to be easy and casual.
112) 8) dialog: (singing) Climb to the top, look over the ledge. Dance barefoot on a razor's edge. Reach for the stars, grab the tiger by the tail.
112) 10) dialog: Good!
112) 11) dialog: (singing) If you go home, you're rolling the dice. Can't step in the same river twice. If you love too much it'll turn to hate. If you never leave home you'll never be late. If you eat too much, you're gonna get fat. If you buy a dog, you'll piss off your cat. Grandpa Cliff and Nana both laugh.
112) 12) dialog: Take a deep breath, and enjoy the ride. Cause arrivals and departures run side by side... Annie's parents cheer as the song concludes.
112) 14) dialog: Alright, you're our first audience, you know? Mason demanded we work on it the whole drive.
112) 18) dialog: It's a work in progress.
115) 0) text: The family walks through the woods. Annie holds Cooper to her chest in a cloth carrier. Mason has his camera in han Dad chews on a piece of straw.
115) 2) dialog: Yeah.
115) 7) dialog: Want me to stay with you?
115) 9) dialog: You sure?
115) 14) dialog: Hey, you guys don't mind coming back here on the 20th, do you, for Cooper's baptism?
115) 16) dialog: Sam?
115) 18) dialog: I appreciate it. It means a lot to Annie and her folks, you know.
115) 20) dialog: I wasn't the least bit concerned with the state of your soul. We can do it now, though, if you want.
115) 22) dialog: You and Cooper together, you know. Dunk your heads.
115) 24) dialog: And what's that supposed to mean, hm?
115) 27) dialog: Well, I think that shotgun should live at my house, huh. I don't think your mom would love that. Dad picks up a rock.
115) 28) dialog: Hey, look out, Sam. Let me show you how it's done. Dad skips the rock across the pond.   Mason photographs i
115) 30) dialog: Still got the goods, hmm?
126) 0) text: Mason sits on the stairs video chatting with Dad on his p
126) 1) dialog: Well, so it's -- it's runnin' okay? That alternator's not messin' up anymore?
126) 4) dialog: (Laughing) Well, you gonna see your sister when you guys are in Austin?
126) 6) dialog: Alright, well, did you apply there yet? Did you get that application in to UT?
126) 8) dialog: Yeah, right. Well, if you know that's where you wanna go, you should probably do that early acceptance thing. You know? I mean seriously, let 'em know you're a man who knows what he wants.
126) 10) dialog: A bit of decisiveness goes a long way in this life, alright?
126) 12) dialog: Great. And uh, what about work? How's that goin'?
126) 14) dialog: (Laughing) Well, when people ask me about you I say, "Oh, Mason, he's doing great. He's got a job, he's really cleanin' up."
126) 16) dialog: (From Phone) Alright, hey, hey, say hi to Annie and Cooper, will you? Dad pans the phone to Annie and baby.
126) 22) dialog: (From phone) Alright, alright, well, be careful when you're driving, alright? Don't be texting, don't be doing any of that. Alright? Just, you're Obi Wan. You're centered, patient, right? You watch three cars ahead, two behind. It takes two bad drivers to have an accident okay?
126) 24) dialog: (From phone) Right, and listen, tell your sister to pick up her phone or call me back or something. Mom comes down the stairs and drops a bag at Mason's feet
126) 26) dialog: Alright, buddy!      You have a good one.
139) 0) text: Family and friends chit chat throughout the house. Mom prepares snacks, while Dad and Annie talk with UNCLE STEV
139) 3) dialog: (laughing) We're aware.
141) 1) dialog: Uh, look who's here!
141) 17) dialog: (to Uncle Steve) No, don't even start, don't start, don't start.
143) 24) dialog: Oh, uh... Alright, uh, well... Mason, I'll make a toast to the future. To your future. You know, it's been a little sketchy this... end of the school year here, trying to figure out what school to go to. Mason told me that, uh, he wanted...to get as far away from home as possible. But still honor our agreement that we pay in-state tuition, which I do appreciate. He's a prudent man, and uh, he's going to have a great future. So, here's to you buddy.
143) 26) dialog: Congratulations.
143) 28) dialog: Alright, that's enough. Just ignore him. My brother needs to learn to pace himself.
143) 32) dialog: Come on, Samantha.
144) 0) text: Dad and Annie talk to Grandma.
144) 3) dialog: You guys met before, haven't you? Annie, Catherine...

144) 16) dialog: Nice to see you, too, Catherine.
144) 18) dialog: Yeah, yeah we all are.
144) 20) dialog: If you think she's a bitch now, you should have seen her fucking twenty years ago. They laugh.
145) 0) text: Later, Uncle Steve, Dad, and Mason have a manly discussio
145) 2) dialog: Steven...
145) 5) dialog: Steven...
145) 7) dialog: It's not that simple.
146) 0) text: Later Dad enters the kitchen where Mom happens to be.
146) 1) dialog: Do y'all recycle?   Should I --
146) 3) dialog: Oh, yeah, right. Okay, great. Okay. Am I, uh, am I your only ex at this party?
146) 5) dialog: Yeah.
146) 7) dialog: No.  No, I can't. (a beat) You did a great job with both of them, by the way.
146) 9) dialog: Well, it's true.    Thank you.
146) 11) dialog: I know, I know, right? It's gonna be uh, fifteen years till I have an empty nest. But hey, I'd love to pitch in, help with this, if I could.
146) 14) dialog: I mean, it's so great that you did this. I was just going to give you a little. I'd appreciate it if I could. He pulls out his wallet.
146) 16) dialog: Yeah. But I don't have any cash. It's in Annie's purse. I'll be right back.
147) 0) text: Mason and Dad are wandering through the green room area w the band is doing a sound check.
147) 1) dialog: ...So it sucks. I mean, the guy's a college lacrosse player. I mean, what are you gonna do?
147) 3) dialog: You want a beer?
147) 5) dialog: You can have one.
147) 7) dialog: Yeah, well, for what it's worth, we've all been through the exact same thing, at one point or another.
147) 10) dialog: No, I know, I know.    It's not the same.
147) 12) dialog: Hey, Jimmy.    Hey, man.   Hey --
147) 14) dialog: We're up here raiding the green room. Hope that's okay.
147) 16) dialog: Alright.
147) 18) dialog: Uh-huh.    Right?
147) 20) dialog: Well, we just decided to come a little early, check you out.
147) 22) dialog: Alright, alright. He and Mason slowly start to drift around the venue.
147) 23) dialog: (back to Mason) I guarantee you, you didn't do anything wrong. These high school love things, they never work out. Here, come here.
147) 28) dialog: Look, and I also guarantee you that every day of your life that you spend crying over some silly girl is a complete waste of time.
147) 30) dialog: What?
147) 32) dialog: Here's the truth. Women are never satisfied. Ok? They're always looking to potentially trade up and that's, I'm sorry to say, what I think has happened to you my fine feathered friend.
147) 34) dialog: It means don't hand over the controls to your self-esteem to Sheila.
147) 36) dialog: Alright. It means you are responsible for you, not your girlfriend, not your mom, not me. You. And if you truly take care of you, you will be amazed at how much girls like Sheena start lining up at your front door.
147) 39) dialog: Yeah, you know, you just gotta separate yourself from the pack in some way. Excel at something, you know, and then you have your pick of the litter when them front-running hussies start sniffing around.
147) 41) dialog: Exactly. Or you could, you know, start a band. Worked for me a long time ago. I think it's still working for Jimmy. Or you just keep taking pictures.
147) 43) dialog: Alright. I'm sick to death of her, okay? I only met her a few times and yes she was cute, alright. But, truth be told I always thought she was a little bit, you know, a little bit too square for you. Y'know, not quite the same vibe.
147) 45) dialog: On some subtle, lower level. I mean, uh, I wasn't surprised when it turned out she was interested in some knucklehead lacrosse player, okay? I mean, bottom line is, it's all timing with these things. Y'know. I mean, uh, take your mom and me. Y'know I think I probably turned into the boring castrated guy she wanted me to be fifteen or twenty years ago, y'know? And man I'm not saying she was wrong to be pissed. I'm not, I'm just saying that, y'know, she could have been a little more patient... a little more forgiving.
147) 49) dialog: Of what?
147) 51) dialog: Everything? What's the point? I mean I sure as shit don't know. I mean, but, neither does anybody else. Okay, we're all just winging it, you know? I mean the good news is you're feeling stuff. You know? And you got to hold onto that. You do. I mean you get older and you don't feel as much. You're skin gets tougher. The point is those pictures you took. Thousands of submissions from all over the state and you won.
147) 53) dialog: I'm gonna kill you. I'm tryin' to tell you that I believe in you, Mason. I think you're really special, and if some girl doesn't see that, then fuck her, y'know? Jimmy's at the mic.
147) 55) dialog: Woo-oho!
