120) 3) dialog: Hey, what's up?
120) 5) dialog: Pretty good.     How long have you been here?

121) 0) text: Mason and Sheena sit and talk.
121) 2) dialog: Why aren't you?
121) 4) dialog: Yeah. I guess it's really easy to say, like, I don't care what anyone else thinks, but, everyone does, you know? Deep down.
121) 6) dialog: Yeah. So... in this perfect world where no one's controlling you, what's different? What changes?
121) 8) dialog: Whatever that means.
121) 10) dialog: You're kinda weird, you know that?
121) 15) dialog: I don't know. Do you wanna be weird?

121) 20) dialog: I'm glad.

127) 3) dialog: Oh, right now?
127) 6) dialog: How?
127) 8) dialog: So you deleting your Facebook page is gonna change all that? Remember when Trevor deleted his Facebook page last year and everyone just hated him? You made more fun of him than anyone.
127) 10) dialog: But it looked like he was so pathetically desperate for attention. Or to be different, or something.
127) 12) dialog: And then he had to make a big announcement about it when he came back a month later.
127) 14) dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. Were you saying something? She laughs.
127) 17) dialog: It's not an experience, it's just information. Look, for example, I just got the address of the club where we're meeting them later, so we won't be wandering the streets of Austin lost for an hour tonight. Thank you very much, Facebook. And I just texted my mom back.
127) 19) dialog: Oh! Oh my god, most importantly, Meg's family just got a miniature pet pig. Sheena hands him the phone.
127) 21) dialog: Right?
127) 23) dialog: I want one.
128) 0) text: Gotye's "Somebody That I Used To Know" plays. Patrons chatter. Mason plays pool with Samantha's BOYFRIEND. Samantha and Sheena sit and talk.
128) 3) dialog: I see.   Cool.
128) 5) dialog: It's room 2-0-6, right?
128) 7) dialog: Awesome. It's not like weird that we're staying there?
128) 9) dialog: Thank you. So how long have you guys been dating?
128) 11) dialog: Yeah, he seems cool.
128) 13) dialog: Does he go to UT too?
128) 16) dialog: Cool.    What is he studying?
128) 19) dialog: Does he wanna... does he wanna teach?
128) 21) dialog: Um, I'm not really sure yet. We're gonna look at apartments tomorrow, um, but I know my parents sorta were expecting me to live in a dorm.
128) 23) dialog: Yeah. But I mean, I'm paying my way through college, so it doesn't really matter that much.
128) 25) dialog: That's what I figured.
128) 27) dialog: Yeah.
128) 30) dialog: I'm excited.

132) 3) dialog: See those sorority girls over there? I've just decided, if you delete your Facebook page, I'm pledging.
132) 6) dialog: I wonder what his deal is. I mean, he obviously has money to eat here.
132) 8) dialog: Look at all these people. What are they even doing here at 3:00 in the morning?
132) 10) dialog: We know what we're doing here. She dips a chip into a bowl of queso.
132) 12) dialog: Queso.   We have a purpose.
132) 14) dialog: HELL yeah.
132) 16) dialog: Mm-hm.
132) 18) dialog: We ever gonna go to class?
132) 20) dialog: When it feels right.     When the inspiration hits.
132) 23) dialog: Uhhh... more queso?
132) 27) dialog: What?
132) 30) dialog: I don't think it's that transformative. I just see it as the next step.
132) 32) dialog: Well, I like your mom.
132) 34) dialog: (to Waitress) Thank you.

137) 6) dialog: She's my best friend.
137) 8) dialog: Take it up with her, then.
137) 10) dialog: You had already bought the tickets. It's just prom, it's not like it matters. I'm just tryin' to be friends with you.
137) 12) dialog: Mister I-Don't-Care-What-Anyone-Else- Thinks-Of-Me.
137) 14) dialog: Fine.    We're not going.
137) 17) dialog: Why are we even... I mean, we both knew this was coming. I'm just the one who did something about it.
137) 19) dialog: Oh, fuck you! (a beat) I don't regret anything.
137) 21) dialog: You know, it's actually kind of a relief not to have to be around someone who's so gloomy all the time. The world's not so horrible. Not everything's some big conspiracy against humanity.
137) 23) dialog: He's not a jock, okay? He just happens to be on the lacrosse team. We're all going to other schools next year anyway, it's not some super serious relationship.
137) 25) dialog: We're just having fun.
137) 27) dialog: Grow up, Mason.
137) 30) dialog: Who?

137) 36) dialog: Now you're just trying to be an asshole.
