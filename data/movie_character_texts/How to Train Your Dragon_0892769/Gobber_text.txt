4) 1) dialog: Ah! Nice of you to join the party. I thought you'd been carried off. Hiccup dons a leather apron and starts to put away Gobber scattered appendages.
4) 3) dialog: They need toothpicks, don't they? Hiccup gets to work, transferring bent and chipped weapon the forge as Vikings crowd the counter for replacements.
5) 15) dialog: Oh, you've made plenty of marks. All in the wrong places.
5) 17) dialog: You can't lift a hammer. You can't swing an axe... Gobber grabs a bola (iron balls connected by rope).
5) 26) dialog: See, now this right here is what I'm talking about.
5) 28) dialog: Hiccup. If you ever want to get out there to fight dragons, you need to stop all... Gobber gestures in Hiccup's general direction.
5) 32) dialog: Yes! That's it! Stop being all of you.
5) 39) dialog: 
5) 43) dialog: I'll take my chances. Sword. Sharpen. Now. Hiccup takes it begrudgingly and lobs it onto the grindin wheel. He stews... fantasizing...
8) 7) dialog: Man the fort, Hiccup, they need me out there! Gobber pauses. Turns with a threatening glare.
10) 21) dialog: Sure, Hiccup.
10) 23) dialog: Well, it runs in the family.
10) 30) dialog: You're thinking about this all wrong. It's not so much what you look like. It's what's inside that he can't stand. Beat.
10) 32) dialog: Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not. Hiccup SIGHS heavily.
11) 20) dialog: I'll pack my undies.
11) 26) dialog: Oh, perfect. And while I'm busy, Hiccup can cover the stall. Molten steel, razor sharp blades, lots of time to himself...what could possibly go wrong? Stoick sinks onto the bench beside Gobber, his brow burde
11) 28) dialog: Put him in training with the others.
11) 30) dialog: So am I. Stoick turns to him, glaring.

14) 0) text: Gobber raises a massive iron gate at the entrance of a va stone arena.
14) 1) dialog: Welcome to dragon training! The recruits file through the gate, and out onto the aren floor. They take it in like gladiators entering the colosseum. The walls are covered in scorched silhouettes blasted Vikings. It's a grim yet awe-inspiring place.
14) 12) dialog: Let's get started! The recruit who does best will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village.
14) 15) dialog: (cheery, in confidence) Don't worry. You're small and you're weak. That'll make you less of a target. They'll see you as sick or insane and go after the more Viking-like teens instead. GOBBER stick him in line with the others and continues on toward five massive reinforced doors.

14) 39) dialog: Shields. Go. The recruits scramble for shields, finding them scattered around the ring.
14) 49) dialog: Tuffnut, Ruffnut, you're out!
14) 54) dialog: Those shields are good for another thing. Noise. Make lots of it to throw off a dragon's aim. The kids scoop up weapons and begin hammering on their shields. The Gronckle shakes its head at the clatter.
14) 62) dialog: Correct, six. That's one for each of you!
14) 65) dialog: Fishlegs, out. Gobber spots Hiccup hiding from the Gronckle's molten slu

14) 76) dialog: One shot left! Hiccup panics and chases after his shield as it rolls acr the ring. The sudden movement sends the Gronckle chasing after him, leaving Astrid in the clear.
16) 6) dialog: She's right, you have to be tough on yourselves. CREAK. All eyes turn to Hiccup, entering the hall, sheepishly. Gobber glares at him.
16) 15) dialog: Thank you, Astrid. Gobber stands.
16) 18) dialog: No attacks tonight. Study up. Gobber EXITS into the storm, leaving the teens staring at book.
19) 6) dialog: Look for its blind spot. Every dragon has one. Find it, hide in it, and strike.
19) 15) dialog: Blind spot? Yes. Deaf spot? Not so much. Hiccup wanders up to Gobber, while the others dart past.

22) 4) dialog: (with a mouthful) Un-unh. It's the wings and the tails you really want. If it can't fly, it can't get away. A downed dragon is a dead dragon.
26) 26) dialog: Fishlegs! Beat. A clicking sound comes from behind them. Sparks fla in the smoke.
26) 29) dialog: 
33) 0) text: Hiccup grabs the head as instructed, then discreetly pull fistful of âdragon-nip' and presses it up to the Gronkl nose. It immediately stops struggling and goes weak in th knees.

44) 7) dialog: Well, I trust you found the nest at least?
44) 9) dialog: Ah. Excellent. Gobber follows Stoick up the ramp and snags his duffle ba with his hook appendage, sharing the burden.
44) 11) dialog: Well, if by success, you mean that your parenting troubles are over with, then... yes. Stoick stops. What does that mean? A group of merry villagers rush past.
44) 21) dialog: Yeah...most afternoons. But who can blame him? I mean the life of a celebrity is very rough. He can barely walk through the village without being swarmed by his new fans. Stoick is doubly confused.
44) 23) dialog: 
48) 17) dialog: Not so fast.
48) 26) dialog: You've done it! You've done it, Hiccup! You get to kill the dragon!

59) 3) dialog: Night Fury! Get down! Toothless bounds over the crowd and BLASTS a hole through chain enclosure. He flies through it and disappears in th boiling smoke. The Vikings rush to railings... in time to see a flurry o wings cutting through the dissipating smoke. Toothless an the Nightmare tumble into the clear, locked in a toothy, vicious fight. Toothless kicks the Nightmare off and plan himself between Hiccup and it. The Nightmare snarls, circling them. Toothless lunges and ROARS... causing the Nightmare to relent and back away. To everyone's shock and horror, Hiccup gets to his feet a grabs Toothless protectively.

64) 14) dialog: Ah. Of course. Send them running. The old Viking fall-back. Nice and simple.
66) 5) dialog: Ah. I was wondering where that went. A clicking buzz becomes audible, growing louder. It fills sky, converging in one general direction. Stoick sniffs t air.
68) 3) dialog: In my undies. Good thing I brought extras. Stoick TURNS to face the men.
68) 10) dialog: Is that it? Above the island, dragons POUR from every crevice, fleein the sky. The sound of screeching dragons fades.
68) 19) dialog: Beard of Thor...what is that?
68) 25) dialog: Heh. Smart, that one. Stoick looks up and down the beach for an answer.
68) 35) dialog: I think I'll stay, just in case you're thinking of doing something crazy. Stoick grabs him.
68) 38) dialog: Then I can double that time. Stoick grins. Friends to the bitter end. They BREAK COVER dash into the open, SPLITTING UP. Stoick rips a sharpened post from the ground and hurls it into the monster's face
