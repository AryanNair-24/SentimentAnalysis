8) 0) text: Almost feels like a dungeon. Think high-tech  Frankenstein. Walls lined with video displays, technical  readouts, bizarre medical equipment. On a table in the middle of the room, a sheet drapes over a humanoid form, strapped down at it's invisible limbs.  The straps move slightly... ghostly. Wires lead from the  body to lots of machinery.
8) 8) dialog: Sorry, Boss. Forgot.
9) 0) text: FRANK CHASE, early thirties, and tech expert JANICE  WALTON, early twenties, man a small booth above the lab.  They re dressed more like band roadies than scientists. The room is crammed with electronic and recording  equipment. A handful of monitors display different images of the lab. Thermal and regular video. Another screen  monitors vital signs.

35) 0) text: Frank and Janice shuttle the playback controls as a VIDEO MONITOR re-plays various angles of Sebastian's phase  shift.
35) 2) text: Frank halts the tape. SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) Index that. That was when it started  burn. Epidermal reaction.
54) 0) text: Dim lights. Janice and Frank both don eye guards. Frank  switches on a low intensity laser on and it's beam shoots across the room. The beam distorts slightly in the center of the room. As Frank widens the spectral pattern,  suddenly the beam splits into a million different  spectral rainbows, momentary illuminating Sebastian's  entire frame in a glowing tingle of light.

We push in until we are looking over Frank's shoulder at  the video monitor. According to the video, Sebastian is  sleeping soundly in his room.
96) 0) text: Frank glances over at the video monitor. He can see  Sebastian's heat signature lying in the bed. Frank feels something on his neck. He flicks whatever it  is away with his hand and goes back to work.
101) 0) text: Frank's reading a book when Linda and Matt enter.
101) 2) dialog: Quiet. He worked in the lab till about  10:30 and then went to sleep.
120) 0) text: As we watch the footsteps head back through the puddles  toward the warehouse, we see Frank pass us in his car.
122) 0) text: We follow Sebastian down the hallway to his cubicle. But  as he rounds the corner, he quickly ducks back. The  entire research team is in his cubicle. Sebastian slowly  approaches and watches as Frank takes down his video  board.
122) 1) dialog: Pretty clever really. All it does is  recycle the signal. He flips this  switch, it takes a snapshot and that's  all we see.
122) 5) dialog: Dogs aren't people. Are we in any  danger?
129) 0) text: Frank, Sarah, Carter and Janice man various work stations in the lab. Linda and Matt enter.

130) 5) dialog: Already in. It was only a second level  encryption.
130) 8) dialog: Oh the system is fine. It's just I'm  just extraordinary.
130) 9) text: Frank types a few more keys, and his eyes widen. FRANK (cont'd) But apparently someone is more  extraordinary than me.
130) 11) dialog: There's nothing wrong with the system.  Our codes have been removed.
130) 13) dialog: Here's a clue. Only one code remains. 
130) 15) dialog: Dr. Sebastian Caine.

170) 2) text: Sebastian TOGGLES the intercom switch OFF. We pan over to one of the working video screens ... Matt and Frank  stride down the hallway. The chair swivels and the  observation room door swings open slightly.
171) 2) text: Linda bangs on the glass. She looks. No movement, no  nothing. She listens. Shit. She takes off running. LINDA (cont'd) Matt! Frank! 
171) 3) text: Tracking with Linda as she rushes down the hall. LINDA (cont'd) Matt! Matt! Frank!
