6) 18) dialog: What s that make it?
6) 20) text: Like a smug gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from  the top of her tranquilizer gun.

12) 2) text: She wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it  tight. She then takes some dye and sprays it. A surface  appears, floating beneath the restraints. It sheens in  the light as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps the  surface several times. A small bulge appears, like a  vein.
12) 3) dialog: Propped.
12) 8) dialog: Come on, Isabelle. You can do this. 
14) 4) dialog: It s working. It s actually working. 
14) 10) dialog: Subject may be in pain or extreme  discomfort.
14) 18) dialog: Got the crash cart.
14) 23) text: The body is only half there. It looks as if its caught in decomposition. Linda rubs the cardiac paddles together.
14) 24) dialog: Clear!
14) 25) text: Linda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest. The jolt  of electricity makes the monkey visible again for a brief moment. Then the skin and flesh fade away again.
14) 28) dialog: Come on Isabelle. Come on. You can do  it. You can fucking do it.
14) 36) text: The monkey grunts and groans. Blinks its eyes. Linda  hovers over it stroking its fur.
14) 37) dialog: Welcome back, Isabelle.
14) 38) text: Sebastian puts his hand on Linda s shoulder... a move  that does not go unnoticed by Matt. We did it.

15) 5) dialog: We should celebrate.
17) 0) text: The din of the diners fades away as Linda slips out onto  the restaurant's balcony. She find Sebastian leaning  against a railing, breathing in the night air.

17) 5) dialog: A little "I am become death... the  shatterer of worlds"?
17) 7) dialog: Since the day I met, all you wanted to  do was change the world.
17) 8) text: She puts her hand on his shoulder. LINDA (cont'd) Listen, I know we've... I mean... well  ... I just want you to know how proud  I am of you. I know it probably  doesn't mean a lot...

22) 9) dialog: It's their money, Sebastian. It's  going to happen eventually.
23) 13) dialog: Sebastian ... humans can talk, build  houses and cook in microwave ovens.  Gorilla's live in trees. That's a  helluva 2% if you ask me.
23) 15) dialog: Why you? Why not one of us?
23) 18) dialog: What if you're too valuable to lose?
24) 2) text: Linda pushes into the room and closes the door behind  her. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) What?
24) 3) dialog: In the past six years, I've never once  challenged your decisions, but this  ... Sebastian. I don't think you  should do this.
24) 5) dialog: Oh please. How long were we together?  You must've said it a million times  ... Nobody knows who built the lunar  lander. All they remember in the first  man on the moon.

25) 3) dialog: Sorry. I just can't let it go.
25) 6) dialog: So how can we let him do this?
25) 8) dialog: In a heartbeat.
25) 10) text: Linda thinks about it. It's still tempting. MATT (cont'd) This is his chance to be Chuck Yeager  or Christopher Columbus. Well, if I  were him I'd do the same thing.
25) 11) text: Matt goes back to kissing Linda.
25) 12) dialog: Let me ask another question.
25) 14) dialog: Is the human race really ready for  what we're doing?
25) 17) dialog: No really. Is it ready? We're  barrelling down a road that begs moral  and ethical questions that I don't  think we can answer.
25) 19) dialog: This night is still young. (beat) I mean, when you think about it, it's  creepy. Do we really want to live in a  world where people can just disappear  in the blink of an eye?
28) 3) text: The buzz of conversation is punctuated by an amplified  HEARTBEAT, thumping its familiar rhythm. Bah-bump.  Bah-bump. In the center of the room, Sebastian, dressed  only in a pair of jogging shorts is strapped to a table  inclined at a 45 degree angle. Electrodes are strapped to his body. An I.V. tube snakes from the needle in his vein up to a bag of saline solution. Dripping slowly. Linda  makes last minute checks of some of the equipment. She  pats Sebastian on the shoulder.
28) 4) dialog: O.K. How're you feeling?  Sebastian takes a deep breath.
28) 10) text: Linda takes a moment and studies Sebastian's face. She's  almost teary eyed.

30) 25) dialog: Frank?
30) 30) dialog: Here we go.
30) 35) dialog: What do you feel? Keep talking. KEEP  TALKING!
30) 39) dialog: Prop the crash cart.

32) 21) dialog: (whispers in his ear) You did it, Sebastian. You're the  first.
33) 0) text: The chamber is half constructed out of Plexiglas at the  end of the Hallway of Habitats. On the recovery bed, a sheet drapes over Sebastian's  invisible body. The gentle bleatings of medical machinery pound out a dulling rhythm. Linda sleeps in a corner chair as Matt slips into the  room. He checks the readouts on Sebastian then takes a  seat by Linda. She wakes with a start.
33) 2) dialog: His breathing's hypnotic. How long's  it been?
33) 4) dialog: Where are the others?
33) 6) text: Linda rubs her temples and gestures to the bed.
33) 7) dialog: I keep looking at that hole, wondering  if he's really there.
33) 8) text: She notices something out of the corner of his eye. The  sheet twitches. LINDA (cont'd) Did you see...
33) 11) text: Linda and Matt watch intently. Then suddenly... the  sheets thrash violently. A yell of pain.
33) 13) text: Linda jumps up and crosses to Sebastian. Matt rushes to  the wall and turns off the lights. Darkness. The room is  lit by the glow of machinery. SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) I can't... I can't close my eyes. I  can't close my eyes.
33) 14) dialog: Your eyelids are transparent.
33) 17) dialog: Yes.
33) 19) dialog: Your arms ... your whole body... It  worked, Sebastian. It worked.
33) 28) dialog: Your system received quite a shock.
33) 30) text: Linda realizes that he's standing very close by. Her hair lifts slightly and Sebastian inhales. Chills go down her  spine.
33) 31) dialog: Sebastian.
33) 32) text: Linda's hair drops back to her shoulders.
33) 36) dialog: Sebastian?
33) 37) text: No answer. Linda and Matt look at each other, slightly  alarmed.
33) 41) dialog: Gimme symptoms. Dizziness, nausea,  headache, body-ache, disorientation.
34) 0) text: Carter, Frank, Janice and Sarah work at various research  stations. The door opens and Linda and Matt enter.
34) 2) dialog: Why don't you ask him?
34) 3) text: Linda motions to the gap between her and Matt. The four  of them stare at the nothing.
34) 8) dialog: He can't close his eyes so they're  sensitive to light.
34) 9) text: Linda's explanation puts everyone at ease.
34) 13) dialog: C'mon Sebastian. Knock it off.
35) 4) text: Janice scribble the numbers in her notebook. Linda  crosses, nursing a cup of coffee.
35) 5) dialog: It's late. Time you got some rest.
35) 7) dialog: Hate to pull rank, but you're my  patient now and you need rest. We've  got a busy day tomorrow.
36) 0) text: As Linda enters she points to a small camera in the upper corner of the room.
36) 1) dialog: We've set up a thermal camera for  observation and I've arranged one of  us to be here 24/7 in case you need  anything. The team's gonna be on alpha- call alert for the duration. If  anything goes wrong, we can all be  here within...
36) 3) dialog: I was trying to be reassuring.
36) 5) dialog: What's that?
36) 8) dialog: Please. I'm just doing my job.
37) 0) text: A bank of monitors display the various angles of the Hall of Habitats, the laboratory and, of course, Sebastian in  the recovery room. Linda hands Sarah a cup of coffee.
37) 1) dialog: You gonna be okay?
37) 3) dialog: Carter'll be in at six to spell you  and I'll be in by nine. Call me if  anything happens, okay?
37) 4) text: Through the glass wall, Linda sees Matt knocking and  waving her out.
38) 2) dialog: Days only get longer from here.
38) 3) text: Linda catches Matt's eye. Gives him a look. "You coming  over?" Matt nods, "yes", imperceptible to everyone but  Linda. She smiles.
48) 0) text: Linda and Matt finish listening to Sarah's story.
48) 2) dialog: Why didn't you call me?
48) 6) dialog: I can talk to him.
49) 19) text: The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda  searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times,  then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin. His skin  bends and gives. The needle remains in sight after it  slips through the visible surface. Sarah presses down on  the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream. SARAH (cont'd) Dr. Caine... this might sounds stupid,  but are you... are you looking at me. 
55) 0) text: LINDA pulls vials from the cyclotrons and props blood  sample slides. She slips them under the microscope. She  takes a sip of her Diet Coke and puts it on the table.  She pears into the microscope and analyses the blood  sample, squeezing more stain onto it. She looks up to  make notations, but when she reaches for her Diet Coke IT ISN'T THERE. She looks around. It's on the other side of  her microscope. She shrugs it off, she takes a sip and  sets it down where it was before. She peers into the  microscope again and when she looks up... the Diet Coke  is gone. She looks around the room and sees it on another table completely.
55) 1) dialog: Sebastian? Goddamnit.
55) 4) dialog: That's what worries me.?
55) 6) dialog: What happens when we turn the project  over to the Army. Ever wonder how much  fun they're gonna have?
55) 9) text: Linda pulls away from him.
55) 10) dialog: Stop it, Sebastian. It's not funny.
55) 12) text: Linda walks away. Sebastian laughs.
55) 13) dialog: Grow up.
55) 15) dialog: Got some sleep. Big day tomorrow.
56) 0) text: A bevy of activity below us as the scientists prepare.  Matt slides the antigen cocktail into the centrifuge and  starts it spinning. A sheet drapes over a Sebastian's frame, straps across  his limbs. He is fully wired. Linda looks up to the observation booth.
56) 1) dialog: Recording?
56) 4) dialog: De-Phase protocol. Injecting Serial  Protein Caine One Two Seven.
56) 5) text: Matt removes the glowing vial of orange liquid from a  centrifuge nearby. Carter hands Matt a hypo. Matt jabs it into the vial, drawing up the colored liquid. Linda  sprays Sebastian's arm with dye. LINDA (cont'd) Ready?
56) 7) dialog: Tough.
58) 3) dialog: What's wrong?
58) 9) dialog: Carter!
58) 10) text: Carter grabs onto the mass of flesh and muscle, trying to hold it back. But the restraints snap. The half-visible  man is screaming. He grabs Carter and throws him across  the room. LINDA (cont'd) Sebastian! Sebastian!
58) 11) text: And just for a second, Sebastian is fully visible. And  free. He looks around like a scared animal and rips off  all the wiring. LINDA (cont'd) Sebastian!
58) 13) text: Sarah preps a tranquilizer. Sebastian locks eyes with  Linda. He's lost, he doesn't know where he is. And  suddenly, he crumbles to the ground. Linda rushes over to him and puts bar hand on his shoulder. Light bleeds from  his skin and his skin begins to dissolve from sight.
58) 14) dialog: He's reverting. Got him on the table. 
58) 15) text: Matt, Linda and Sarah pull the shifting body up and onto  an operating table. Carter pulls himself up and heads  back to the group. LINDA (cont'd) Get me a I.V. of A.G. seven.
58) 21) dialog: Sebastian... can you hear me? Can you  hear me? How are his pupils?
59) 0) text: Linda stares through the Plexiglas walls into the  Recovery Chamber. Inside the Chamber, Sarah and Carter- eye the various screens monitoring Sebastian's vitals. Linda watches the hollow pocket underneath the blanket.  She watches the rhythm of its rises and falls as  Sebastian sleeps. Matt comes up behind her.
59) 2) text: Linda exhales in relief. Matt puts his hands on her  shoulder. Pulls her close to him. MATT (cont'd) How bout you? You gonna be okay?
59) 3) dialog: Guess so. (beat) I was just thinking about the Apollo  missions. Y'know? Grissom, White and  Chaffee... What it was like for them  on that launch pad that day, thinking  they were gonna reach the stars only  to burn to death.
59) 5) dialog: But he didn't die, did he? (beat) What if we can't bring him back? What  then?
59) 8) dialog: No. I want to be here for him.

61) 10) text: Linda smiles.
61) 11) dialog: I should be making you feel better.  Not vice versa.

64) 0) text: Sebastian, still in his latex and scrubs, but looking  like he's been dragged through the nine levels of  purgatory, is escorted back to the recovery chamber by  Linda and Matt. He crosses to his bed and collapses on it. Closes his  eyes.
64) 2) dialog: Could be the barium or the radiation.
64) 5) text: Linda and Matt exchange a glance. Linda quickly covers.
64) 6) dialog: Do you want me to stay?
73) 0) text: Linda and Matt each rush to their respective cars.
73) 2) dialog: I'll meet you at the lab. I'm gonna  swing by his place, just in case.
73) 4) text: Matt tries to give her a quick pack. Linda backs away.
73) 5) dialog: (quietly, looking around) I don't want him to see.
75) 0) text: Linda drives Sebastian's apartment. She spots his black  Porsche in the parking lot. She pulls over to the curb,  jumps out of her car and heads into the building.
77) 0) text: Linda exits the elevator and heads down to Sebastian's  door. She knocks. Waits. No answer. She knocks again.  Waits. And then she tries the door. It's unlocked. She pushes  the door open.
77) 1) dialog: Sebastian?
78) 0) text: Linda pushes through the living room, into the bedroom.
78) 1) dialog: Sebastian?
78) 4) dialog: Oh shit.
78) 5) text: She scramble for the bedroom phone and quickly dials. LINDA (cont'd) Yeah, Matt, it's me. He was here. No.  He's taken his make-up off. I don't  know...He must be outside somewhere. I don't know where he went. I'm coming  back to the lab. How? How'm I supposed  to do that? I CAN'T FUCKING SEE HIM!  We're going on alpha call.  I want  everyone at the lab now. We're gonna  need thermal visors and we may need  tranqs.
80) 0) text: The elevator doors open and Linda steps inside. The doors close shut behind her. A beat later we see the  indentations of footsteps come around the corner. We  follow the breathing and stumbling footfalls back into...
82) 2) dialog: Use your imagination.
82) 5) dialog: The Metro stops running after midnight  and he's on foot, so he can't have  gotten too far.
82) 7) dialog: This program is classified. If he's  out there it means someone might find  out about him. He could destroy the  whole program.
82) 12) dialog: Bullshit! I went to your apartment and  I happen to know you did a helluva lot  more than pick some stuff up.
82) 14) dialog: You, of all people How could you? 
82) 15) text: Caught dead to rights, Sebastian sinks into his chair. He thinks she knows. LINDA (cont'd) You put yourself and this project at  risk.
82) 17) dialog: I saw your face and your clothes.
82) 21) dialog: That's not good enough. When you're  outside the lab there are a thousand  variables none of us can control. It's  just not safe for you to be out there.
82) 23) dialog: You volunteered for this, Sebastian.  You knew going in there could be  consequences. (beat) For the security of this project, I'm  gonna have to ask you to confine  yourself to the compound.
82) 25) dialog: You're right. It's your decision. But  if you leave the compound again, I'll  notify the oversight committee. Then  they can make the decision. You  understand?
82) 28) text: A long beat. Sebastian slowly rises, acknowledges Linda  with a nod and leaves the room. Linda looks around at her silent co-workers, the goggles and tranqs still on the  table.
82) 29) dialog: Pack 'em up... Everyone go home.
83) 0) text: The Lab is buzzing with the usual activity. Linda rolls  up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing nothing.
83) 1) dialog: Hold still.
83) 4) text: The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda  searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times,  then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin.
83) 5) dialog: Not enough to worry about.
83) 7) text: Linda presses down on the hypodermic plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream. SEBASTIAN (cont'd) It's funny. All these years I've known  you, I never pegged you for a  megalomanic.
83) 8) dialog: What are you talking about?
83) 10) dialog: I didn't ask for this, Caine. But when  a classified experiment disappears in  the middle of the night, someone's  gotta run the show. (tries sympathy) Look, I know how hard this has been  for you.
83) 13) dialog: Now it's a gift?
83) 16) dialog: Where're you going?
84) 0) text: Linda enters to find Sebastian reading the collected  works of T.S. Elliot.
84) 1) dialog: Want to talk about it?
84) 3) text: Linda looks over his shoulder.
84) 4) dialog: "We are the hollow men, the stuffed  men, headpieces filled with straw."
84) 7) dialog: I don't want to fight you. I just want  what's best for the program.
84) 9) dialog: You can be scared. That's okay.
84) 11) dialog: You're talking like you've given up.  It's only been a few months.
86) 0) text: Linda, Matt and Sebastian, in latex and scrubs, stare at  an electron microscope's video display. On the screen in  a sparse colony of blood calls but every second more and  more cells appear, filling the gap.
86) 5) text: They wait. Linda points to a blank patch on the screen.
86) 6) dialog: That's all we need.
86) 14) dialog: I'll go talk to him.
101) 0) text: Frank's reading a book when Linda and Matt enter.
102) 0) text: Close on the security camera. The wires have been removed and the access panel replaced. Sebastian whistles a cheerful tune as he finishes  applying his makeup. The door opens and Linda and Matt  enter.
102) 2) dialog: Good morning.
102) 6) text: Linda hands Sebastian a disk.
102) 7) dialog: I restructured the third genome on  your radiated protein strand. Thought  you might want to take look.
102) 9) dialog: I thought you'd want to take a look at  it.
103) 0) text: Linda pulls bags of frozen plasma from the shelves in the walk-in storage freezer.
103) 1) dialog: I'm telling you, I know him.  Something's going on.
103) 3) dialog: If he knew about us, he'd be angry and  that wasn't angry.
106) 0) text: Alone, Linda packs up her stuff for the evening. Slowly we push in on her and hear quiet breathing. We  realize we are in...
106) 3) text: Linda-jumps. SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) Sorry, didn't mean to frighten you.
106) 4) dialog: It's fine. I just didn't know you were  there. Goodnight.
107) 0) text: Linda passes through the revolving doors of her apartment building. A few beats later, as if caught by a gust of  wind, the revolving door slowly turns on its own.
108) 0) text: Linda slips into her apartment and the door closes behind her. A moment later we see the doorknob turn back and  forth. It's locked.
109) 0) text: On a fire escape, we see the ladder shake and descend to  the ground. The metal rattles back and forth as if  something were climbing it. We slowly crane up the fire escape and hold on a window.  Through the wispy curtains and dirty glass we can see  Linda enter the room. The panel of glass fogs from  Sebastian's breath. The fog wipes away, seemingly by  itself. But then through the window we see Matt walk into the  living room and put his arms around Linda's waist. We  hear a shocked intake of air. He kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress. Her  dress falls to the floor. Matt takes off his sport coat  and drapes it over a chair, while Linda unfastens the  buttons of his shirt. They're laughing now, exchanging  kisses. Matt reaches behind Linda and unhooks her bra. He kisses  his way down her neck to her breasts. Linda pulls him to  her. Suddenly the window shatters. Startled, both Matt and  Linda jump back covering themselves. We hear Sebastian's footsteps as he retreats down the  fire escape. A moment later Matt reaches the window and peers out. He  sees the fire escape ladder slowly rise back up down  below.

Kramer puffs on a pipe and  strokes his beard, shaking his head. Kramer rises and shakes hands with Linda and Matt, and  the three of them head toward the front door.

164) 0) text: Matt and Linda push along the corridor; Matt spraying  with the fire extinguisher in short controlled bursts,  Linda clutching her tranquilizer like a commando. A noise behind them. Footsteps. Matt turns to blast with the extinguisher. The white  chemical dust sprays out, outlining a shape in the  tunnel. But it isn't a human shape. Matt's uniform shreds. Something with fierce sharp claws  fells him. Tearing into his flesh. We see a angry, hungry face... jabbing for a moment through the lingering fog.
164) 2) text: Linda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke.  Matt trips and goes sprawling. Something yelps. A howl.  Linda shoots. Her dart jabs into something which  collapses to the ground. A moment of calm. As the dusty  chemical foam settles, the outline of a great ape  appears, still twitching. MATT (cont'd) Karl Three. Nice shot.
164) 3) dialog: He's let the animals out. It wasn't  him we were tracking.
164) 4) text: Linda leans against the wall, still clutching her tranq  gun at the ready. The heat is getting to bar. Bar scrubs  are soaked, her hair's a mess. She wipes the sweat from  her brow. LINDA (cont'd) You okay?
164) 6) dialog: Me .... Don't ask about me. If he  freed all the animals, we could have  dozens running around the lab.
164) 9) dialog: Get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors  and pray to God Frank can reprogram  the elevator.
166) 3) text: But it's Linda and Matt. FRANK (cont'd) Did you see her?

169) 5) dialog: This didn't happen. This hasn't  happened.
169) 11) dialog: He's here!
169) 13) dialog: Sebastian!
169) 14) text: Silence. The three cautiously move out. They stand back  to back, each one facing out. They move toward the door  of the Chamber. LINDA (cont'd) Sebastian. Sebastian, listen to me.
169) 16) dialog: I don't know if you can understand  this, but what you're experiencing is  a psychological breakdown. This isn't  who you are.
169) 20) dialog: You goddamn bastard! You goddamn  bastard. You're gonna pay for this.  I'm going to bring you back to  visibility and then I'm going throw  your ass in jail.
169) 22) dialog: Fuck you!
169) 24) text: Linda slams her fist against the wall of the Chamber.
169) 27) text: Matt gives Linda a kiss...
169) 31) dialog: Shut up, Sebastian. He's more of a man  than you'll ever be.
170) 0) text: A VIDEO SCREEN shows Linda pacing outside the Chamber  door. The chair moves forward toward a microphone.
171) 0) text: Linda still holds his tranq gun toward the door. Nothing  moves. Nothing. Linda walks over to the Plexiglas ...  stares in. Can't see anything, anyone. Just the dead  Sarah. Then she sees it. The little red light on the intercom.  Its on.
171) 1) dialog: Sebastian? Sebastian? No.. No...
171) 2) text: Linda bangs on the glass. She looks. No movement, no  nothing. She listens. Shit. She takes off running. LINDA (cont'd) Matt! Frank! 
171) 3) text: Tracking with Linda as she rushes down the hall. LINDA (cont'd) Matt! Matt! Frank!
172) 0) text: Linda breaks in the room to see Frank slicked in blood,  his throat cut, and Matt bleeding from multiple stab  wounds with an extension cord around his neck being  pulled tight.
172) 1) dialog: Jesus!

172) 4) text: Matt's pulled back across the lab by the cord around his  neck. He grabs at the cord trying to breathe. Linda  watches him being pulled away.
172) 5) dialog: No!
172) 6) text: She clamors over to him. But Matt rises in the air and is tossed against the lab table. Linda levels her dart  pistol and fires haphazardly at the air. She hits nothing but objects jerk and move in a line as Sebastian heads  for cover. Linda manages to grab Matt and pull him to  her. LINDA (cont'd) Hang on!
172) 8) text: Linda pulls Matt toward the door.
172) 9) dialog: (yelling) You won't get away with this. They'll  find out about you. They'll hunt you  down.
172) 11) text: Linda hits the lights. The lab is now very, very dark. SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd) See, I've spent all my time down here  thinking up this plan. When they find  you, they'll find a pile of charred  corpses. The result of a terrible  accident, I'm afraid.
172) 12) text: Linda reacts to the voice as it grows nearer. She  navigates the maze of equipment, heading toward the crack of light at the front door.
172) 13) dialog: How can you be so brutal?
172) 15) text: Linda and Matt have reached the door of the lab. She  pushes through it and slams it behind her.

173) 2) dialog: Just keep going. I'll fix you later.
175) 0) text: Linda looks up and down the hall and pulls Matt inside  the supply room. It's still blood soaked from earlier. Linda closes the door, sliding the deadbolt into place. Linda lots him drop like a heap onto the floor. She falls to her knees beside Matt, lying on the ground.
175) 1) dialog: Matt... Matthew. Stay with me now. 
175) 2) text: Linda pulls his scrubs open. The wounds are many and  deep.
175) 4) dialog: Shhh. Don't talk.
175) 5) text: BAM! Something slams against the door. Bam! Slams against it again. The old deadbolt is buckling. Linda looks  around the room and sees the storage freezer. LINDA (cont'd) We gotta move. Hang on.
175) 6) text: Linda helps Matt up and into the storage freezer.
176) 0) text: Linda grabs a metal bar and slides it between two hooks  on the door and the jam. BAM! The storage room door blows open. Linda leans down  next to Matt.
176) 3) text: Linda picks up his hand. Grips it tight.
176) 4) dialog: You feel that?
176) 8) dialog: Your losing blood, but he didn't hit  the vitals.
176) 9) text: She looks around. LINDA (cont'd) Sutures and thread.
176) 10) text: She rises, and looks outside the porthole into the room.  Suddenly it fogs up and she almost sees a face. She  stumbles backward, and the door starts rattling. Linda  scrambles over to hold the metal crowbar in place.  Sebastian pulls and rattles on the freezer door. To no  avail. It's not gonna budge. Finally he gives up. The  door stops shaking. Linda is relieved, briefly.  Still.  Then she hears the click of the door locking.
176) 13) dialog: Goddamnit.
176) 14) text: Linda looks around the storage room. She grabs a roll of  duct tape and pulls off a length.
176) 16) dialog: This is temporary.
176) 17) text: She takes paper towel and cleans off Matt's wound. She  tapes it, using duct tape. LINDA (cont'd) You still with me?
176) 20) dialog: Just keeps getting worse.
176) 21) text: Linda returns to the door. Shakes it.
178) 0) text: Linda continues shaking the door. The lock holds. A tear  rolls down Linda's cheek, but a strange thing happens.  The tear drops freeze. Linda shivers as she pulls the icy tears from her face.
178) 1) dialog: Oh shit.
178) 2) text: The inside thermometer has dropped to five degrees. Linda grabs the metal bar and starts smashing it against  the porthole. The metal bar just bounces off the glass.
180) 0) text: Linda drops the metal bar and slides down the wall,  defeated.
180) 2) dialog: There's got to be.
180) 5) dialog: Matt! MATT!
180) 6) text: She checks his pulse. Thank god he still has one, but  he's not gonna last long. They're both already starting  to turn a little blue. Linda stares desperately up at the shelves, trying to find some sort of advantage. Then she  sees something. She looks back at the door lock and then  she rises ... and grabs AN EXTENSION CORD coiled on the  shelf. LINDA (cont'd) We're not dying in here.
182) 0) text: Linda finishes stripping the insulation off the electric  cord.  She grabs a hypodermic needle package, and her cold  fingers fumbles with the package as she tries to pull out the plastic tube. She finally gets it out and she starts wrapping the  stripped electric wire around the tube in a tight coil.
184) 0) text: Linda furiously winds wire into a coil.
186) 0) text: Linda holds the plug end of the extension cord. The other end is wrapped into a tight long coil. Linda looks for an outlet, but can't find one. She looks at the overhead  lights. A moment later she's climbing up the shelving. She wrap*  a piece of fabric around her hand, and with a sharp punch she smashes one of the overhead light bulbs.
188) 0) text: Linda works on jerry rigging the two ends of the wire to  the lightbulb, socket.  Suddenly the coiled wire springs to life and flies  against the nearest metal surface. She's made an  electromagnet.
190) 0) text: Linda feels the rumbling as she places the coil up  against the door. The magnet attaches itself. Linda  shakes the coil, trying to get the doorlock to move.
192) 0) text: The door lock twitches again and twists back. The door  swings opens and Linda stumbles out, mashing into a  supply shelf of oxygen canisters. The canisters tumble  every which way as Linda tumbles to the ground. She scrambles to her feet and goes in after Matt, pulling his cold body out of the storage locker. She pulls stacks of paper down from, the shelves into a  trashcan, grabs an industrial lighter and ignites the  paper. She pushes Matt close to the small bonfire. As she does, the oxygen tanks catch her eye.
194) 4) dialog: Sebastian!
194) 5) text: And there's Linda. Slicked with dirt and blood. She holds a oxygen container with a cut line. LINDA (cont'd) I can't let you leave. Come on out and  I'll give you one last chance.
194) 8) dialog: Aaaaaaahhhh!
194) 9) text: She hits the top of a LIGHTER duct-taped to the hose. A  line of PRESSURIZED FIRE BLOWS into the elevator.  WWHHHOOOOSSHHHH! Sebastian goes up in flame. Linda runs  toward the elevator. Just as the door's about to close,  she slides. Her foot jamming into it.  She lets loose with the flame again. Sebastian, backed  into the corner, has no where to go. He's yelling in  pain. His latex FACE BUBBLES and burns. The surgical  scrubs SINGE BLACK. With no other escape route, he dives  toward the door. Linda looks up to see his flaming body  fly over her, back into the corridor. Linda kills the  tank as Sebastian continues to burn. The elevator lights  flickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of  sparks. The elevator dies. Linda pulls herself to her  feet and turns to see... Half of Sebastian's head MELTED AWAY, his latex facade a  gruesome smoke-damaged mass. His clothes are half burned  revealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath, like  deformed blackened bubble wrap. Sebastian crawls to his feet, but Linda hits him with  another shot of flame. Sebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the  corner.
194) 11) text: Linda stalks toward him.
194) 12) dialog: You wanna see God? I'll show you God. 
194) 13) text: Linda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex  and clothing strewn about the corridor floor. Sebastian,  looking like some ugly creature, pushes down the  corridor. He throbs with his blackened skin blistering  and cracking up and down his body. Linda lets loose  another jet of flame. It's smaller than the first and  doesn't quite hit Sebastian. Linda checks the tanks  pressure gauge. It slowly drops. Linda follows the  blackened horror into the maze of tunnels. But as he  pushes along the corridor, his burns slowly re- absorb  themselves. Sebastian is no longer visible. A quiet  moment in the hallway as Linda realizes how vulnerable  she is. She looks around for him desperately. Nothing.  But something on the ceiling catches her attention. She  blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch. THE  SPRINKLER SYSTEM, hit by fire, comes to life. Water  sprays down on the tunnel. Sebastian is caught in the  downpour, his invisible frame outlined by water. It comes toward her, the hot skin steaming in the water. He grabs  Linda and slams her against the wall. His watery hand  smashes her across her face. Linda reels. On the floor,  she looks to see Sebastian stalking toward her. She  crawls away, but he grabs her by her hair, pulls her to  her feet and slams her against the wall.
194) 16) text: Linda collapses to the floor. Sebastian's foot presses  against her neck, squeezing it. Linda gags for breath.  But through the shoot of water that is Sebastian, we see  something also... a watery smudge.
194) 20) text: Just as the two turn, Sebastian rises with the crowbar.  He swings it with a yell. Matt pushes Linda out of the  way, his arm glancing the blow into a conduit. The  conduit splits open and severs ELECTRICAL wiring. The  VOLTAGE shoots up the crowbar and into Sebastian. As the  current pulses through his body, Sebastian vibrates. His  blood vessels yank back to visibility, followed by his  skeletal structure and major organs. Sebastian is slowly  electrified. Smoke pours off him and he becomes more and  more visible. Finally he collapses. His body throbbing in and out of visibility. Matt and Linda stumble away.
195) 0) text: Just outside the lab... Linda tries to pry open the  sealed doors with the crowbar. But she can't. Through the doors porthole she sees a collection of  chemicals and the fire raging from the earlier explosion.
195) 1) dialog: Nitro...
195) 5) dialog: He's rigged the centrifuge.
196) 0) text: Linda and Matt move as fast as they can. They reach the  burned out elevator. What the hell are they gonna do? We  know the damn thing doesn't work. She swings her crowbar  at the ceiling. The maintenance hatch comes down.
196) 1) dialog: Grab on.
196) 2) text: Linda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls  herself up. She reaches back down for Matt.
196) 4) dialog: Fuck you. Give me your hands.
196) 5) text: Linda grabs Matt's hands and pulls for all she's worth.  She struggles, but they both manage to got him through  the hatch.
198) 0) text: Linda and Matt are on top of the elevator. Linda's hands search the wall. Bar fingers run across the smooth metal surface. From the little light below she can see a maintenance  ladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube. They look up and see it disappear into the darkness.
198) 1) dialog: Climb!
198) 3) dialog: Climb!
198) 4) text: Matt starts up, rung after rung. Linda climbs right  behind him.

200) 2) dialog: Keep moving.
200) 3) text: He does, through sheer force of will. Blood from his  wound drips down on Linda's face. No telling how much  further they have to go in this darkness. Light leaks in  from the maintenance hatch below.

206) 1) dialog: Oh God!
206) 3) text: The carriage accelerates toward them, faster and faster.  Its loose cables whip around the shaft, slapping the  walls around the pair. Its gonna hit them! Linda pulls  herself close to the ladder and closes her eyes. She's  pressed against Matt. The elevator... 50 feet... 40 ...  30 ... W0000000SH! It flames RIGHT BY THEM.  When Linda opens her eyes, the elevator is HUNDREDS OF  FEET ABOVE THEM and a wall of fire is below them, closing in.
206) 4) dialog: Move!
206) 5) text: Panicked, Linda pushes Matt up the ladder as she stares  down at the rising fire wall. But the fire dissipates  before it hits them, though a stray tongue of flames  reaches up to lick the soles of her feet. They hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the  elevator peaking far above her. It slows to a stop and  BEGINS TO FALL.
206) 7) text: FASTER AND FASTER. Coming back toward them in complete  free- fall. It's emergency brakes clamp down, slowing it. Metal against metal. Sparks flying. One of the brakes  shears. Then another. The elevator unseats from it's  tracks, SLAMMING against the walls as it TUMBLES. Linda  sees that the elevator is out of control, and watches as  it ping-pongs toward them... smashing into the access  ladder, smashing into the wall. The elevator slows, but  continues slamming side-to-side. Linda cringes as the  elevator crashes into the wall above them. But it jams  there, stopping. They pull their heads away from wall and look up. The elevator just hangs there, suspended.  There's a small crawlspace between the elevator and the  ladder.
206) 8) dialog: C'mon. Before it slips.
206) 9) text: They begins to climb up again. Matt shimmies through the  tight hollow, and squeezes out the other side, followed  by Linda. She breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs  there a moment when ... Ah! Something grabs her. A singed throbbing hand emerges from the darkness, gripping at her leg. LINDA (cont'd) It's him.
206) 12) dialog: Get off me.
206) 13) text: Sebastian pulls himself up Linda's body. Translucent  dirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes. Linda  tries to climb with this thing on her. But Sebastian  grabs her around the neck. She begins choking for breath. Linda fights to keep her grip on the ladder... She looks  down at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then... She lets go!
206) 15) text: She and Sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam against the top of the elevator. Linda seems to hover a  few above the elevator, Sebastian's shadowy outline below her. Matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder. But  metal groans and the elevator drops another five feet.  Linda struggles to her feet. Sebastian rises. A menacing  dark figure stalking toward her. Linda pushes back from  him. Sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over  to the ladder. The elevator strains and groans.
206) 16) dialog: Let go of me.
206) 21) text: Linda and Sebastian struggle. Matt reaches down to try  and grab her, help her.
206) 23) text: Linda looks at her feet. The last elevator emergency  brake grips its cable. She grits her tooth and grabs hold of the ladder.
206) 24) dialog: Go to hell. 
206) 25) text: Linda stamps on the brake release. The ELEVATOR TUMBLES  ... along with Sebastian. It slams into the fiery abyss a hundred yards below. Linda hangs, one hand holding onto  the ladder, the other holding onto Matt. Matt pulls her  back onto the ladder, using all his remaining strength.
207) 0) text: Linda and Matt stumble out into the blazing sunshine.  Emergency crews close from all directions, sirens  roaring. A trail of smoke drifts higher and higher into  the sky. An ambulance pulls up next to them and the paramedics hop out, immediately putting a blanket around her and  treating Matt's wounds.
207) 2) dialog: We lived.
207) 3) text: Linda looks over her shoulder at the traces of the ruin  and she sees a shimmer of heat rising from the ground...  almost as if something was there.
