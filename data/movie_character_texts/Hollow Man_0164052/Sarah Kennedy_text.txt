But a small portion of the glass fogs, as if someone had  just breathed on it. As the fogged part quickly clears,  we see the door to the observation room quietly open. ON SARAH, still sleeping. We hear a whisper.

Around her nipple. Sarah moans slightly, as if  she were dreaming, but she doesn't stir. And then her  breasts cup slightly, as if they were being touched...  softly... gently. Her breathing becomes harder, more  labored, erotic... and then she... BOLTS AWAKE. Bar eyes  wide with fear. She jumps and cups her own breasts and  looks around the room. It's empty, of course. She jumps  over to the monitor and checks on Sebastian's room. The  heat signature isn't there.

The needle remains in sight after it  slips through the visible surface. Sarah presses down on  the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream. SARAH (cont'd) Dr. Caine... this might sounds stupid,  but are you... are you looking at me.

165) 3) text: She listens. Is that breathing she hears? Now she's  starting to panic. SARAH (cont'd) Dr. Caine?
165) 4) text: She starts to back away, but she's already in the corner. She clutches her tranquilizer gun, but there's nothing to aim at. The vials of blood on the shelf gives her an  idea. She reaches over, grabs a vial and throws it on the floor. GLASS SHATTERS and BLOOD SMEARS across the  linoleum. Sarah tosses another vial and another. Becoming more and more hysterical. Splattering more and more  blood. But she runs out of vials. Shaking with fear, she  searches the blood looking for a footprint, or movement.  But there's nothing there. Sarah waits a beat, clutching  the tranquilizer gun. Takes a step. Waits a beat longer. Finally she relaxes. It was just her imagination. She  heads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper in her ear.

165) 11) text: She struggles, shaking back and forth. Writhing. In  anguish and in fear. SARAH (cont'd) What do you want?
165) 13) text: The trigger pulls .... Pop! A dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in Sarah's  stomach. She whimpers as her eyes glass over. Suddenly  she's released. She stumbles backward and falls lifeless  to the floor. A moment of stillness, all we can hear is  the sound of someone breathing. On Sarah's face... a slight-indentation runs down her  cheek.. Almost sweet... almost tender. And slight indentation  runs across her breast and strokes down her body. The  sense of violation and vulnerability is awful. Sebastian  sighs.
165) 15) text: Sarah's head shifts slightly. Her head shifts violently,  accompanied by the celery crunch of her neck snapping.  Sebastian exhales, his breath filled with the  intoxication of power.

171) 0) text: Linda still holds his tranq gun toward the door. Nothing  moves. Nothing. Linda walks over to the Plexiglas ...  stares in. Can't see anything, anyone. Just the dead  Sarah. Then she sees it. The little red light on the intercom.  Its on.
