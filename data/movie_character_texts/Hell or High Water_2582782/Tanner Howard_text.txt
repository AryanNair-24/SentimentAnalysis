And if I hadn’t blown his shit-for-brains out, there’d be a brand new truck parked out front and four wheelers and anything else he could think to buy. He’d spend it all just to have an excuse to steal some more. But not you... Painting this old house yourself. Driving that beat up truck. Nothing new I can see, ‘cept those pump jacks and each of ‘em paying you a week what you and your brother stole from all four banks combined. 109. Marcus sips from his beer. Toby shifts the muzzle of his rifle discreetly in Marcus’s direction.
