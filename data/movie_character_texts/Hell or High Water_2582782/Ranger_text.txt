20) 40) dialog: That didn’t take long. 104.
20) 42) dialog: Not yet, but I will. Want some coffee?
20) 44) dialog: How come? Marcus smiles.
20) 46) dialog: It’s in my office. They walk toward an office just off the main foyer. The Ranger hands Marcus the file as they both sit down. Marcu flips through it.
20) 47) dialog: Got Tanner's juvenile record unsealed. What a piece of work that boy was. Marcus reads it over.
20) 49) dialog: I’d love to know what he was hunting in the barn. In April. Marcus continues reading.
20) 51) dialog: I don’t know about that, but there’s nothing that ties him to the robberies.
20) 53) dialog: We showed her a picture, said she never seen him ... Pretty upset you took her tips as evidence.
20) 56) dialog: Yep. We showed him Toby’s DMV photo and he said it didn’t look like the fella from the diner.
20) 58) dialog: Well, he’s ninety years old, he didn’t recognize Tanner’s photo either. Marcus sips his coffee as he continues through the file. Holds up a REQUEST FOR WARRANT form.
20) 59) dialog: Yeah, I asked for a warrant on his bank accounts and the ranch, DA wouldn't do it. Toby’s got no record, never been arrested. Only court appearance he ever made was at his divorce. Marcus continues reading.
20) 61) dialog: Was his mamas. Now it’s in a trust for his kids, she died a month ago. Marcus raises an eyebrow.
20) 63) dialog: Mmhmm.
20) 65) dialog: Oh yeah. You wanna know the first thing I noticed? Two drilling crews from Chevron capping wells and putting in pump jacks... The engineer out there said they could pull 2000 barrels a month off that place. Know how rich that’1l make those kids?
20) 67) dialog: I don’t know, whole thing stinks to me. But you try convincing a judge to issue warrants on somebody set to clear fifty thousand a month for stealing forty thousand from the bank that manages the trust on the property. Marcus raises the other eyebrow.
20) 69) dialog: They ain’t the executor, but they hold the money. Oh, it’s one rotten fish, but damned if I can figure it. And you can bet your ass First Texas ain’t pressing it over forty thousand dollars. Lord knows what they stand to make. The Ranger sees the wheels turning in Marcus’s head.
20) 70) dialog: Marcus, if you want to come up here and dig through files, ask questions, that’s fine. There's always coffee in the pot for you, but you can’t go out there, okay? Marcus stares at the DMV photo of Toby. 107.
20) 71) dialog: Marcus ... You’re retired.
20) 73) dialog: Okay. Off the Ranger, not quite believing him.
