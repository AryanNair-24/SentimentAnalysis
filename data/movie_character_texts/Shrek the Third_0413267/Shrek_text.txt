5) 6) dialog: I knight thee...
5) 9) dialog: He-he. Ooh.
8) 15) dialog: I'm Shrek, you twit.
8) 27) dialog: I don't know how much longer I can keep this up Fiona.
8) 34) dialog: Yeah.
8) 38) dialog: Ah. Come here, you.
8) 43) dialog: Oh, my butt is itching up a storm and I can't reach it in this monkey suit!
8) 46) dialog: Oh.
8) 50) dialog: What's your name? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 10.
8) 56) dialog: Hoo hoo hooo. Perfect.
9) 6) dialog: You've done it. Oh, a little over to the left, yeah. That's great.
9) 11) dialog: Ahh! All right, you got it...Oh yeah, you're on it. Oh that's it! Oh that's good!

9) 38) dialog: Are you okay?
10) 3) dialog: That's it! We're leaving!
10) 9) dialog: Calm down? Who do you think we're kidding? I am an ogre! I'm not cut out for this, Fiona and I never will be.

10) 35) dialog: 
10) 40) dialog: Donkey?
10) 45) dialog: Yeah?
10) 51) dialog: Oh.
10) 56) dialog: Honey? Let's try and be rational about this. Have you seen a baby lately? They just eat and poop and they cry and then they cry when they poop and they poop when they cry...Now, imagine an ogre baby. They extra cry and they extra poop.

11) 53) dialog: Oh, come on Dad...an Ogre as King? I don't think that's such a good idea. There's got to be somebody else. Anybody?
11) 58) dialog: Really!? Who is he, Dad?
11) 62) dialog: What's his name? What's his name?
11) 75) dialog: Arthur?
11) 84) dialog: Dad? Dad? Dad?
18) 39) dialog: Oh, c'mon, there's no way I could ever run a kingdom. That's why your cousin Arthur's the perfect choice.
18) 43) dialog: And if he gives me any trouble, I've always got persuasion and reason. (holds up his right fist) Here's persuasion, (holds up his left fist) and here's reason.
18) 46) dialog: Fiona, soon it's just gonna be you and me and our swamp.

21) 14) dialog: 
21) 20) dialog: No, no, no, no, no, no. Ha, ha. It's okay. It's gonna be alright.
21) 26) dialog: Hey! Hey, hey, wait! Would ya? No, no. Stop! Hey, hey, hey. No.
22) 3) dialog: Huh?
24) 3) dialog: Ahhhh! Oh, Donkey! Donkey, wake- up!
24) 11) dialog: Ahhhh!
24) 16) dialog: Oh... I can't believe I'm going to be a father.
24) 19) dialog: How did this happen?
24) 23) dialog: I know how it happened. I just can't believe it.
24) 42) dialog: Donkey, can you just cut to the part where you're supposed to make me feel better?
24) 51) dialog: It's not my life I'm worried about ruining. It's the kid's.
24) 54) dialog: I mean...when have you ever heard the phrase "as sweet as an...ogre" or "as nurturing as...an ogre" Or how `bout..."you're gonna' love my dad...he's a real ogre." Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 32.
24) 60) dialog: That's true.
24) 63) dialog: I'm doomed.
25) 6) dialog: It's Worcestershire.
25) 20) dialog: Well, my stomach aches and my palms just got sweaty. Must be a high school.
26) 29) dialog: Pardon me...
26) 39) dialog: Hi, we're looking for someone named-
26) 49) dialog: I know you're busy "not fitting in" but can either of you tell me where I can find Arthur?
27) 17) dialog: Strong, handsome, face of a leader. Does Arthur look like a King or what?
27) 23) dialog: Oh. Sorry.

29) 46) dialog: 
30) 12) dialog: That's right. I'm the new mascot. So let's really try and beat the other guys... at whatever it is they're doing.
30) 18) dialog: Now, where can I find Arthur Pendragon? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 41.
30) 41) dialog: I'm not here to eat him.
30) 46) dialog: It's time to pack up your toothbrush and jammies. You're the new King of Far Far Away.
30) 63) dialog: Absolutely. Now clean out your locker, kid. You've got a kingdom to run.
30) 68) dialog: The one and only.
30) 84) dialog: Alright, let's not overdo it.
30) 88) dialog: You just overdid it.
46) 8) dialog: Oh no, in fact, the King asked for you personally.
46) 13) dialog: It really is all fun and games, actually. Sure, you have to knight a few heroes, launch a ship or two. By the way, make sure you hit the boat just right with the bottle.
46) 18) dialog: Well, I've heard it's harder than it looks.
46) 37) dialog: Or too salty!
46) 63) dialog: Oh! Festering sores! Hey, you are one funny kitty cat.
46) 67) dialog: We don't want Artie here getting the wrong idea.
46) 70) dialog: Uh, Artie?
46) 78) dialog: Artie!
46) 81) dialog: What are you doing?!
46) 91) dialog: This really isn't up to you!
46) 96) dialog: You'll learn on the job!
46) 104) dialog: Back to what? Being a loser?!
46) 107) dialog: Now look what you did!
47) 6) dialog: Oh, nice going, Your Highness.
47) 10) dialog: Hey, if you think this is getting you out of anything, well it isn't. We're heading back to Far Far Away one way or another, and you're gonna be a father!
47) 17) dialog: You're... I said king. You're gonna be King!
47) 25) dialog: Where do you think you're going?
47) 29) dialog: You get back here young man and I mean it!
47) 37) dialog: Oh c'mon, now why would I do that? Besides, he'll be ten times better at it than me.
47) 43) dialog: You're right, Donkey.
47) 46) dialog: What about this?
47) 54) dialog: Oh c'mon. It's just a joke.
48) 4) dialog: Listen Artie...
48) 7) dialog: If you think this whole mad scene ain't dope, I feel you dude. I mean, I'm not trying to get up in your grill or raise your roof or whatever, but what I am screaming is, yo, check out this kazing thazing bazaby.
48) 10) dialog: I mean, if it doesn't groove or what I'm saying ain't straight trippin', just say, oh no you didn't, you know, you're gettin' on my last nerve. And then I'll know it's... then I'll know it's whack--
49) 8) dialog: Artie! Wait!
49) 34) dialog: You know this guy?
49) 46) dialog: Uh, no.

49) 65) dialog: Understand this kid, it's no more Mr. Nice Guy from here on out!
49) 69) dialog: I know, and I'm gonna miss him.
49) 73) dialog: Oh, is that some kind of crack about ogres? You get your royal highness to Far Far Away before I kick it there.
49) 78) dialog: Self-destructive ra...
49) 85) dialog: Yeah, I don't think so.
49) 90) dialog: Alright, alright... journey to the soul...
50) 13) dialog: I see a rainbow pony. Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 66.
50) 48) dialog: 
50) 56) dialog: I know what it's like to not feel ready for something.
50) 59) dialog: Even ogres get scared...you know, once in a while.
50) 68) dialog: My dad wasn't really the fatherly type either.
50) 72) dialog: Oh yeah? My father was an ogre. He tried to eat me.
50) 75) dialog: Now, I guess I should have seen it coming. He used to give me a bath in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.
50) 81) dialog: You know, it may be hard to believe what with my obvious charm and good looks, but people used to think that I was a monster. And for a long time, I believed them.
50) 84) dialog: But after awhile, you learn to ignore the names that people call you and you just trust who you are.
50) 94) dialog: Thanks Artie.
50) 98) dialog: Yeah. I got that.
53) 24) dialog: "King Charming?"

54) 38) dialog: Oh, have a heart old man!
54) 54) dialog: Well, well, well. You want some eggs with that ham?
54) 72) dialog: Look, if Artie trusts him, that's good enough for me. Even if his robe doesn't quite cover his-
55) 8) dialog: Donkey?
55) 35) dialog: Don't be! You got us back kid.
56) 17) dialog: Pinocchio? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 82.
56) 24) dialog: Pinocchio!
56) 28) dialog: What's happened?
56) 34) dialog: She's what?! She's what!?
56) 37) dialog: (turns to Puss in Donkey's
56) 55) dialog: Quick, Pinocchio. Where is Fiona?

58) 10) dialog: Break a leg. Or, on second thought, let me break it for you.
58) 19) dialog: Where's Fiona?
58) 42) dialog: Charming, stop! I'm here now, you got what you wanted. This isn't about him.
58) 50) dialog: You weren't really next in line for the throne, okay? I was.
58) 54) dialog: Not exactly.
58) 60) dialog: Look, I said whatever I had to say, alright! I wasn't right for the job, I just needed some fool to replace me, and you fit the bill. So just go!
58) 66) dialog: You catch on real fast kid... Maybe you're not as big of a loser as I thought.
66) 6) dialog: Oww, easy.
66) 10) dialog: Huh?
66) 17) dialog: Well... she's got your eye.
79) 23) dialog: Oh boy.
79) 32) dialog: Well it can't be anymore painful than the lousy performance you're giving.
79) 42) dialog: Oooh, if you don't mind could you kill me, and then sing? Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 106.
79) 49) dialog: Oh, come on, I'm just havin' fun with ya. That's actually a very nice leotard.
79) 53) dialog: Do they come in men's sizes?
79) 108) dialog: Much better, now that you're here.
79) 113) dialog: So Charming, you wanna let me out of these so we can settle this ogre to man?
79) 122) dialog: Fiona! Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 109.
79) 139) dialog: Artie?
79) 223) dialog: Ah-hem.
