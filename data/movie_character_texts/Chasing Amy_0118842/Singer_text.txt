4) 75) dialog: Thank you.  Thanks.

4) 77) dialog: A long time ago, we used to have this  bass player who took off one day to  draw funny books or something.  Maybe  you've seen her stuff - it's called  'Idiosyncratic Routine''
4) 79) dialog: But what a lot of people don't know is  that she used to harbor these  delusions that she could sing.  And  she used to subject us to these  throaty renditions of Debbie Gibson  tunes and shit, insisting that we let  her front on a few numbers.  Well, we  didn't and she quit.. and then she got  famous, the bitch. (crowd laughs) But she's here tonight, and I think if  we all begged, or maybe offered her  some X, she'd get up here and treat us  to some of her vocal stylings. (crowd applauds) What do you say, Alyssa?
4) 81) dialog: She's shy. (yelling) GET UP HERE AND SING, BITCH!!
4) 82) text: The crowd thunders.  Alyssa offers the Singer an  embarrassed half-smile.  She looks at Holden, who claps  along with the others and nods toward the stage.  Alyssa  shakes her head and relents, heading through the crowd Banky and Hooper stand at the bar.
4) 85) text: Alyssa jumps on stage, hugging the Singer.  She takes the mic, shaking her head.  The crowd is applauding.
