9) 466) dialog: Alyssa Jones?  Shit.  I know Alyssa  Jones.  I mean, I know Alyssa Jones,  you know what I'm saying?   Me and Rick Derris used to hang our  with her for awhile, right?  Just  hanging around her house after school,   'cuz her parents were like never home,  and shit.  And one day, Rick just  whips it out, and starts rubbing it on  her leg and shit; chasing her around  the living room - I was dying.  But  you know what the crazy bitch did?   She fucking drops to her knees, and  just starts sucking him off right in  front of me!  Like I wasn't even there  man!  I almost died!  But that's not  the fucked up part - the fucked up  part was Rick, man - right in the  middle of it, he turns to me and he's  pointing at her and he says "Cohee."   Just like that - "Cohee."  So I'm like  I'll give it a shot.  And I start  pulling her pants down all slow, 'cuz  I figure any second she's gonna turn  around and belt me in the mouth,  right?  But yo, check this shit out -  she's all into it man!  She don't try  to stop me or nothing!  She's                  all wet and shit, and I just went to  work, know what I'm saying?  Me and  Rick are going to town on this crazy  bitch, and she's just loving it, all  moaning and shit!  It was fucked up!   So Rick's the one that came up with  the nickname - 'cuz that day, she had  us locked in tight from both sides -  like a pair of goddamn Chinese finger  cuffs!
