1) 2) text: Holden sits at a table.  Across from the barely-managing- to-stand Fan.  He offers him a patronizingly kind, half- smile in return,
1) 3) dialog: You bet.
1) 4) text: We're at a Comic Book show, specifically at a book- signing. Behind Holden hangs a large banner, heralding  HOLDEN McNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS - CREATORS OF BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC'.

2) 16) dialog: But Vader turns, out to be Luke's  father.  And in Jedi, they become  friends.
2) 21) text: The crowd-is gone.  Holden sits in his chair, laughing.  Hooper steps off the stage and picks Banky's head up off  the floor.
2) 25) dialog: How do you manage to get away with  this all the time?  Shouldn't cops be  busting your head open right about  now?
2) 28) dialog: Your publisher condones these  theatrics!
2) 42) text: Holden hits him.
2) 44) dialog: (shoots him a look; to  Alyssa) Sorry about him.  He's dealing with  being an inker.

2) 71) dialog: For years now.  Started back in third  grade - a nun was teaching us about  the Blessed Trinity.  She's going on  about the three persons in one God  thing - Father, Son, Holy Spirit - and  he just goes ballistic.  I guess it  was too big for him to grasp.  They  got into this huge fight.
2) 73) dialog: You ever seen a nun call a small child  a fucking cunt-rag'?  Wasn't pretty,  Shit like that's bound to happen when  you make a kid wear a matching tie and  slacks everyday.
2) 75) dialog: Limited to wine-tasting prior to mass.  Turned me into a grade school  alcoholic altar boy.  I couldn't tell  you how many mornings after serous  benders                I'd wake up next  to strange priests.
2) 77) dialog: Sharp!  No.  I'm just a fan of clergy- molestation humor.  Probably why the  extended family quit inviting me to  First Communion parties.
2) 78) text: Alyssa laughs.  Holden smiles.
2) 80) dialog: Not professionally.  You know - only  in bars.
2) 83) dialog: It goes back to something my  grandmother told me when I was a kid.  "Holden," she said "The big bucks are  in dick and fart jokes."  She was a  church-goer.
2) 85) dialog: I'm sorry - did I detect a note of  bitter envy in there!
2) 87) dialog: (looking out window) It's all about marketing.  Over- or  underweight guys who don't get laid -  they're our bread and butter.  People  like those two outside should be  yours.
2) 89) dialog: And sadly, there are more of our core  audience out there than yours. (smiles) Look at that, though - kind of gives  you a little charge, to see two people  in love.  And all over Banky's car, no  less.  That car's seeing more action  right now than it's seen in years.
2) 91) dialog: (still looking at OC Couple) You've gotta respect that kind of  display of affection.  It's crazy,  rude, self-absorbed - but it's love.

2) 97) dialog: A story?
2) 99) dialog: 'Doctor Zhivago'.

2) 109) dialog: A stiff.
2) 111) dialog: Get out of here.
2) 113) dialog: Clever.
2) 115) dialog: At which time he marries the high  school sweetheart and lives happily  ever after.
2) 117) dialog: Someone wrote 'Fuck' inside his new  steamer trunk.
2) 119) dialog: What kind of asshole writes that  inside a steamer trunk!
2) 121) dialog: A hero's welcome for the new  millionaire.
2) 123) text: Holden is silent Alyssa downs her drink.
2) 125) dialog: (beat) That's a love story!!
2) 127) dialog: I should hope so.  Jesus, that's the  saddest tale I've ever heard.
2) 129) text: Alyssa tosses her last dart.  Holden seems a bit dazed.   He looks out the window.
2) 130) dialog: Those two aren't on the hood of  Banky's car anymore.
2) 132) text: Alyssa exits to the night.  Holden stares after her.  Two beats later, Hooper and Banky enter, holding an  'Everything's Archie' comic between them.
2) 135) dialog: Huh!  Oh.  She left.  She said she'd  call you later.
2) 139) dialog: (shaken) What!

3) 0) text: We're in Holden and Banky's studio/apartment.  It's a  rented loft-style place with high ceilings, wood floors  and sparse furnishings.  There are posters on the walls,  a sort of kitchenette, a hockey net, a big TV. (with all  the trimmings - VCR, Laserdisc player, Sega, SNES), a  huge comfy couch, and two drawing boards with adjacent  desks (littered with pencils, pens, coloring pencils,  paints, erasers, etc.) - at which sit Holden and Banky.   They're working.  Some music plays. C.U. OF HOLDEN PENCILING - over his shoulder, we see  Holden sketching Chronic in mid-attack of his arch- nemesis - the Giggler.  Holden erases a line and re- draws. C.U. OF BANKY INKING - over his shoulder, we see Banky  outlining a pre-penciled page.  He traces Bluntman  swinging from a street light. The two work in silence.  Then...
3) 2) dialog: It's the one across from the post  office.
3) 4) dialog: Thanks. (beat) What do you wanna do tonight!
3) 6) dialog: (erases) You got a weird thing for Canadian  melodrama.

3) 20) dialog: I'll be there.
3) 23) dialog: Hooper.  He invited me to a club.
3) 25) dialog: (getting up) Not that kind of a club.
3) 27) dialog: 'We'?  You can't go.  He's setting me  up with Alyssa.
3) 29) dialog: And I don't want you messing it up.
3) 31) dialog: (pulling on coat) I just told you - it's not that kind  of club.
3) 33) dialog: (throws him his coat) How are you going to get home if I  hook up!
3) 35) dialog: Let me explain something to you, my  witless chum the other night in that  bar, we two - Alyssa and I shared a  moment, alright!
3) 37) dialog: (brings his two pointer  fingers together) We shared a moment.  And in that  moment, one thing was made abundantly  clear: this girl loves me, my friend.    Loves-me.
4) 17) text: Holden enters.
4) 19) dialog: Where is she?

4) 34) text: ON THE DANCE FLOOR - Holden slips into the crowd and  dances up to Alyssa.  He intentionally bumps into her.

4) 43) dialog: How is it that we never ran into one  another?

4) 49) dialog: Miller Hill?
4) 51) dialog: Sandy Hook?
4) 53) dialog: This is so cool.  The mall!
4) 55) dialog: Wait - here's the big test: Quick  Stop!
4) 57) dialog: You know that girl!!
4) 59) dialog: You know what this is!  This is fate.
4) 61) dialog: I was talking about us meeting - what  are the chances!
4) 63) dialog: The Quick Stop girl died!
4) 65) dialog: Y.M.C.A pool!  Damn!  You knew her  too!
4) 67) dialog: One friend in an asylum, the other  friend in the grave.  You're a  dangerous person to know.
4) 69) dialog: Very solid.
4) 71) dialog: Two towns away from each other for  years and we had to meet in New York.
4) 74) text: Holden looks at her.
4) 78) text: The crowd applauds.  Alyssa shakes her head, smiling.  Holden pokes her.
4) 80) text: Alyssa shakes her head no.  The crowd urges her.  Holden  pushes her forward.
4) 82) text: The crowd thunders.  Alyssa offers the Singer an  embarrassed half-smile.  She looks at Holden, who claps  along with the others and nods toward the stage.  Alyssa  shakes her head and relents, heading through the crowd Banky and Hooper stand at the bar.
4) 89) text: Holden smiles.  Banky joins him.  Holden glances at him. Banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile. The band starts playing.  Cross cutting begins. Alyssa launches into a torchy tune.  The song is  extremely sexy - as is Alyssa who works the mic, making  direct eye contact with... Holden.  Or does she!  Holden is smiling, being seduced, Banky rolls his eyes.  Beside Holden, stands a pretty  GIRL with a short haircut, who's also riveted by Alyssa's performance. Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out  there.   The song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at.   It's more than obvious there's a seduction going on, bur  of whom!  At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but Alyssa's preoccupied.  She points to someone in the  crowd, and curls her finger back in a 'c'mere' fashion,  urging whoever it is to join her.  She jumps off the  stage. Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw- shucks style.  At that moment, the Girl beside him leaps  forward.  Banky's eyes widen.  Holden looks up and is  suddenly taken aback. Alyssa and the Girl race into each other's arms and fall  into a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss. Holden's eyes bug.  Banky allows a smile to creep across  his face.  The crowd applauds.  Banky looks around, and  for the first time, we get the distinct impression that  this is a lesbian bar... There are a lot of chicks in this place.  Gay chicks.   Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back.
4) 91) text: Holden continues to stare - mouth agape. Alyssa and the Girl continue to kiss.
5) 0) text: Banky, Holden, Alyssa and the Girl from the dance floor  sit around a table.  Alyssa and the Girl continue to make out.  Holden and Banky casually watch, wide-eyed.  Banky  stares a little harder.  Holden hits him.
5) 2) dialog: (under his breath) That's rude.
5) 6) dialog: Sorry.  It's just... new to him.
5) 21) dialog: (hits him) Would you shut up!!
5) 23) dialog: (to Alyssa) I don't know how many times I can  apologize for him.
5) 35) dialog: Here we go.
5) 39) dialog: As stupid as you usually come off  during this diatribe of your's, you're  going to come off ten times as stupid  on this occasion.
5) 45) dialog: You're such an idiot.
5) 53) text: Banky and Alyssa laugh.  Holden looks at a small scar on  his arm and thinks better about mentioning it.  Then Kim  re-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck.
5) 54) dialog: (off Banky's watch) Holy shit, is that the time.  We've  gotta beat traffic.
5) 56) dialog: (getting up) And rush hour starts in six hours.   Let's go. (to Alyssa) Thanks for inviting us out.  It was...  educational.
5) 59) text: Holden reaches in and pulls Banky out.  Alyssa watches  them go, then turns and kisses Kim.
6) 0) text: Holden looks preoccupied.  Banky flips through magazines, biting off mini pieces of the gum he's chewing.  He  sticks them between pages, presses the mag closed, picks  up another one and then repeats the whole process.  A  Receptionist types.
6) 2) dialog: Lower your voice.
6) 6) text: The Secretary goes back to typing.  Banky shrugs at  Holden.
6) 8) dialog: I'm sure the gay community appreciates  your support.
7) 3) text: The Execs and Sloss laugh.  Holden and Banky politely  join in.  Banky shoots Holden a 'these guys are idiots'  look.
7) 8) text: Banky leans back into the couch, wearing a thoughtful  face.  He looks to Holden, then to Sloss.  Sloss nods in  understanding.
7) 19) dialog: (interrupting) I don't think it's a good idea.
7) 20) text: Banky and Sloss freeze.  They stare at Holden.
7) 22) dialog: The cartoon.
7) 25) dialog: Is this how you want to be remembered!   As the guy who created Bluntman and  Chronic!
7) 28) dialog: But it'll be all glossy and main- stream.  We'll lose any artistic  credibility we ever had.
7) 38) dialog: I'll give it some thought
7) 40) dialog: I'm retarded!  This from the guy who  only forty five minutes ago paid fifty  bucks for what's supposed to be a boot- leg of 'March of the Wooden Soldiers'  with a deleted scene of Stan Laurel  wearing a French Tickler.
8) 0) text: There is a door.  There's a knock at the door.  Holden  opens it and Alyssa is standing there.
8) 2) text: Holden smiles.
9) 0) text: Alyssa and Holden walk through the park, eating hot dogs.
9) 2) dialog: Twelve episodes.
9) 4) dialog: Banky seems to think so.
9) 7) dialog: I don't know if that's the perception  I want people to have of our stuff.  I  know this sounds pretentious as hell,  but I like to think of us as artists.   And I'd like to get back to doing  something more personal - like our  first book.
9) 9) dialog: (beat) As soon as we have something personal  to say.
9) 11) dialog: What?
9) 13) dialog: Uh... thanks.
9) 15) dialog: I didn't say anything.
9) 17) dialog: Sure.  Harrison Ford.  And our mail- man.
9) 19) text: Holden looks away, embarrassed,
9) 21) dialog: Huh!  No, not really.
9) 23) dialog: (beat) It's just that we've.., I mean, I've  never seen that kind of thing up close  and personal.  It just took awhile to  process, longer than usual.
9) 25) dialog: Um.  If you want to.
9) 27) dialog: (beat) Why girls?
9) 29) dialog: Because that's the standard
9) 31) dialog: It's more than that.
9) 33) dialog: Curious about men?  Well... I always  wondered why my father watched 'Hee- Haw'.
9) 35) dialog: No.
9) 37) dialog: No interest.
9) 39) dialog: Girls feel right.
9) 41) dialog: Wait, wait, wait - you're still a  virgin?
9) 43) dialog: But you've only been with girls.
9) 45) dialog: Isn't that the standard definition?
9) 47) dialog: With a member of the opposite sex.
9) 49) dialog: Because that's the standard.
9) 51) dialog: Of course not.
9) 53) dialog: Okay, I'll revise.  Virginity is lost  when the hymen is broken.
9) 55) dialog: Second revision - virginity is lost  through penetration.
9) 57) dialog: Emotional?
9) 59) dialog: Physical penetration.
9) 61) dialog: Yeah, but not real sex.
9) 63) dialog: Well where's the penetration in  lesbian sex.
9) 65) dialog: A finger?  Come on.  I've had my  finger in my ass but I wouldn't say  I've had anal sex.
9) 67) dialog: (beat; then he gets it) You're kidding?!?! (she nods) How...?!?
9) 69) dialog: But doesn't it hurt?!
9) 71) dialog: What about not-so-special occasions?
9) 73) dialog: But how can that be enough?  I mean,  let's be real - how big can a tongue  even get?
9) 74) text: Alyssa swallows what she's chewing and releases her  tongue, which is just huge.  Holden is transfixed.   Alyssa wraps it back up and smiles, standing.
9) 76) text: She exits. Holden remains in the swing.  Alyssa comes  back in.
9) 78) dialog: Just...uh... just give me a moment.
9) 80) dialog: Look at you.  It's a two day trip.
9) 82) dialog: We're going to a convention, for the  love of God.  We'll be busy from ten  'till eight each day.  When are you possibly going to have  time for any of that shit?  In fact,  fuck it - you're leaving some of this  shit here in a locker.  Come on - give  me the two that aren't clothes.
9) 84) dialog: What are you doing?
9) 86) dialog: Who are you, Larry fucking Flynt?   What are you going to do with all of  those?
9) 88) dialog: You've got like thirty books there!   We're only there for two days!

9) 101) dialog: Last minute invite to the Dragon Con'.
9) 103) dialog: What?
9) 105) dialog: The one that wrote the book?
9) 107) dialog: You didn't get invited to the Con'?
9) 109) dialog: Well this sucks. (thinks) You know - both of us don't have to  go.
9) 111) dialog: Yeah.  Banky can go by himself.  It's  not like we're on a panel.  It was  just a signing appearance.
9) 113) dialog: (beat) Where's your apartment?
9) 115) dialog: I'll be there in half an hour.
9) 117) text: They hang up.  Holden reacts to something OC and exits  quickly. C11. Banky points to pictures in the book.  The kid looks on.
9) 120) text: Holden grabs Banky's arm and drags him away.
9) 121) dialog: What are you doing?
9) 123) dialog: Listen to me - I'm not going.  You're  going to have to do this one by  yourself.
9) 125) dialog: Alyssa's coming down for the weekend,  so I want to hang out with her.  You  don't need me for this. (taking his excess baggage) Meantime,  I'll take this stuff home.   You can keep the filth.  I'll pick you  up at nine Sunday night, alright?   Don't forget to plug the Annual and  don't mention the t.v. show, okay?   Call me if you get bored.
9) 135) dialog: Excuse me?
9) 137) text: Holden's at a loss.  Alyssa slips past the Woman,  carrying an overnight bag.
9) 142) dialog: (holding out hand) I'm Holden, by the way.
9) 144) dialog: Look, we're just friends.
9) 146) dialog: And how do you know men so well?
9) 148) text: She slams the door. Holden looks to Alyssa.
9) 151) dialog: Who was that?
9) 153) dialog: Why would you want to hang our with  someone bitter as that?
9) 155) text: She smiles and continues on.  Holden looks back up at the door.  He sticks his own tongue our and sizes it with his fingers.
9) 159) dialog: Yeah.  You?
9) 161) dialog: Really?  Did you have a strict  upbringing?
9) 163) dialog: You think your upbringing had  something to do with your lifestyle  choice?
9) 165) dialog: Shoes?
9) 167) text: With the requisite music, over which we hear a  conversation between Holden and Alyssa. 1) Holden and Alyssa sit in the DINER eating.  Holden's  talking.  The Waitress walks past and drops her pad.  She bends over, to pick it up, hiking her mini-skirt up in  the process.  Alyssa stares at her ass.  Holden stops  talking and stares at her.  Alyssa looks over at him and  offers a caught smile. 2) Holden pushes a shopping cart at the FOOD STORE,  throwing various things into the basket.  Alyssa comes up with a box of Tampons and throws them in.  Holden glances at them, a bit flushed.  Alyssa catches him, picks up the box, and pulls one out.  She proceeds to demonstrate  their usage, throwing one leg on the can and miming  insertion.  Holden puts up his hands in the "I know, I  know," fashion. 3) In the Studio, Holden displays some of his artwork to  Alyssa, during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes  to light it.  It's a child-proof lighter, so she's having trouble.  Holden grows a little frustrated.  Finally, he  grabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with  his teeth.  Alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback.   Holden spits the tab out, and lights Alyssa's smoke.  He  then continues with his display. 4) Holden and Alyssa at the COMIC BOOK STORE.  Steve-Dave and the Fan-Boy eye them suspiciously.  Alyssa pays for a comic.  Steve-Dave glowers at Holden.  He gives Alyssa  her change and they exit.  Steve-Dave goes back to his  card game with the Fan-Boy.  Suddenly, a garbage can  comes crashing through their window.  Steve-Dave rips a  check off the garbage can and punches the counter.  The  Fan-Boy rubs his back soothingly, 5) Holden and Alyssa walk through a PARKING LOT, talking. She takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder. Holden smiles to himself.
9) 168) dialog: Let me ask you something - we get  along, right?
9) 170) dialog: We have a definite chemistry?
9) 172) dialog: But we're both into girls.
9) 174) dialog: But you weren't always gay.
9) 176) dialog: So If we'd met a long time ago, say in  high school...
9) 178) dialog: Thought so.
9) 180) dialog: Come in.
9) 184) dialog: (hits Banky; to Alyssa) I'll be ready in a second.   I just have to school this mouthy  second-stringer.

9) 187) dialog: (off game) What?  Do something!

9) 193) dialog: Final sixty of the third.
9) 195) text: Banky storms away.  Alyssa looks at Holden,
9) 196) dialog: Imagine if I'd only beaten him by one  instead of thirty.
9) 199) dialog: How could you have grown up down the  shore and never played skee-ball?   What did you do with your youth?
9) 202) dialog: Not your grade school years; your high  school years.
9) 204) dialog: (Inserts coin and pulls  lever) The premise is very basic - you roll  the ball up the ramp at varying  speeds, in an effort to pop it into  the score circles.  The higher the  score, the more prize tickets you get.
9) 206) dialog: Trade them in for prizes that aren't  worth nearly as much as you paid to  play the game.
9) 208) dialog: It's fun.
9) 210) dialog: Observe.
9) 211) text: Holden rolls the ball.  It pops into a twenty point  circle.
9) 212) dialog: See?  It's just that simple.
9) 214) dialog: Where's the skill in that?
9) 216) dialog: Just toss one.
9) 217) text: Alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and whips it  overhand.  It pops off one of the circles and shoots back at them, missing them as they duck.  An OC knock and an  "OW!" is heard.  Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs.
9) 218) dialog: (to OC guy) I'm sorry, man.  She's new at this.
9) 219) text: Holden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head. He gets up.
9) 220) dialog: (to OC) Thank you. (hands Alyssa another ball) Underhand.  Throw it underhand.
9) 222) dialog: It's like Spanish Fly.  This'll  probably be the first time I don't  score afterwards.
9) 224) dialog: (grabs a ball) So what'd you do last night? (prepares to throw)
9) 226) text: Holden whips the ball in surprise.  It ricochets off the  ceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine. Alyssa laughs.  Holden looks around, nervously.
9) 228) dialog: Maybe we should just leave before  somebody gets hurt.
9) 230) dialog: He just feels left out, I think.
9) 232) dialog: I thought he was talking to you.
9) 234) dialog: He was just pissed he was losing.
9) 236) dialog: C'mon.  Don't get all p.c. on me.
9) 238) dialog: It says he gets too easily frustrated.
9) 240) dialog: How do you figure?
9) 242) dialog: I think you're reading too much into  it.
9) 244) dialog: You're blowing this way out of  proportion.  We live in a more  tolerant age now.  You refer to  yourself as a dyke.  Hooper calls  himself a faggot all the time...
9) 246) text: Holden kind of sulks.  Alyssa notices.
9) 249) dialog: (off screen) How bad do you suck!
9) 251) dialog: Leave it alone.
9) 253) dialog: (rubs his head; in baby-talk) Aww.  Everyone bugs you.
9) 255) dialog: (beat) You know, you should watch that.  If  you're going to get all bent out of  shape while playing the game, so much  so that you need to curse the t.v.,  try not to gay-bash it, alright.   You're nor that kind of guy. (gets up) And don't call her a dyke, alright?   She's a lesbian.
9) 256) text: Holden goes to his drawing table and takes off his coat. Banky sits there, shocked.  He puts the controller down  and crosses to the drawing table.
9) 258) dialog: (pulling out pencil) I'm starting a new page.
9) 260) dialog: We're friends.
9) 262) dialog: I beg your pardon?  Programming?
9) 264) dialog: It's passive/aggressive gay-bashing;  and I know you're not really  prejudiced at heart.  You should just  find some other way to express your  anger, is all I'm saying.
9) 265) text: Holden starts drawing.  Banky stares at him.  Then he  grabs the pencil out of Holden's hand and shoves him to  the side.  He starts drawing something.
9) 266) dialog: What the fuck are you doing!
9) 270) text: Banky finishes drawing.  Holden's shaking his head
9) 272) dialog: What is this supposed to prove?
9) 274) dialog: (beat; then pissed) The man-hating dyke.
9) 276) dialog: I don't know.
9) 278) text: Holden storms away.  Banky follows.
9) 279) dialog: I don't need this.  I'm going home.
9) 281) dialog: And why would she need to do that?   What is she Mata fucking Hari?!  What  does she gain?
9) 283) dialog: You're so out of line right now..,
9) 285) dialog: Watch your fucking mouth, is all I'm  going to tell you..
9) 287) dialog: Sometimes your paranoia and suspicious  bullshit is amusing.  Sometimes it's  just fucking annoying as piss!
9) 289) dialog: (beat) I think you should let this one go.
9) 291) dialog: Let it go...
9) 293) text: Holden looks at Banky for a long beat.
9) 294) dialog: I'm in love with her, man.
9) 295) text: Banky stares at him.  Holden stares back.  Banky looks  into Holden's eyes.  Suddenly, he softens a bit.  He  drops his head.
9) 297) text: Banky walks away.  Holden watches him go and exits.
9) 299) dialog: I wish you were the one being pursued  by M-TV.
9) 301) dialog: Sure.  Then you could sell our and  maybe pick up the check once in  awhile.
9) 303) dialog: Well it's not like this is a bed and  breakfast,
9) 305) text: She grabs her bag and slides out of the booth.  Holden  watches her, then follows. A23. Alyssa slides up to the cashier's desk as does  Holden, who offers a puzzled shrug.  Alyssa offers the  'just wait' finger.  The CASHIER turns to her.
9) 314) dialog: (to Alyssa) Tell me you're kidding!
9) 324) dialog: I've always wondered what kind of  people buy those things.  I can't  believe you talked him down to twenty  five!
9) 326) dialog: Where are you going to hang it?
9) 328) dialog: You want me to hang it for you?  You  better hope it doesn't get out to the  girl-nation that you needed a man to  help you hang a picture.
9) 330) dialog: (laughs) Yeah, right.
9) 332) text: Holden stares at her.
9) 333) dialog: Why?
9) 335) text: Holden stares ahead.  Then he swerves the wheel to the  right.
9) 339) dialog: Because I can't take it.
9) 341) dialog: I love you.
9) 343) dialog: I love you.  And not in a friendly  way, although I think we're great  friends.  And not in a misplaced  affection, puppy-dog way, although I'm  sure that's what you'll call it.  And  it's not because you're unattainable.   I love you.  Very simple, very truly.   You're the epitome of every attribute  and quality I've ever looked for in  another person.  I know you think of  me as just a friend and crossing that  line is the furthest thing from an  option you'd ever consider.  But I  can't do this any longer.  I can't  stand next to you without wanting to  hold you.  I can't look into your eyes  without feeling that longing you only  read about in trashy romance novels.   I can't talk to you without wanting to  express my love for everything you  are.  I know this will probably queer  our friendship - no pun intended - but  I had to say it, because I've never  felt this before, and I like who I am  because of it.  And if bringing it to  light means we can't hang out anymore,  then that hurts me.  But I couldn't  allow another         day to go by without  getting it out there, regardless of  the outcome, which by the look on your  face is to be the inevitable shoot- down.  And I'll accept that But I know  some part of you is hesitating for a  moment, and if there is a moment of  hesitation, that means you feel  something too.  All I ask is that you  not suppress that - at least for ten  minutes - and try to dwell in it  before you dismiss it.   There isn't another soul on this  fucking planet who's ever made me the  person I am when I'm with you, and I  would risk this friendship for the  chance to take it to the next plateau.   Because it's there between you and me.   You can't deny that.  And even if we  never speak again after tonight,  please know that I'm forever changed  because of you and what you've meant  to me, which - while I do appreciate  it - I'd never need a painting of  birds bought at a diner to remind me  of.
9) 344) text: Holden stares at Alyssa.  She stares back.  Then she gets out of the car.
9) 345) dialog: Was it something I said?
9) 347) dialog: What are you doing?
9) 349) dialog: You're going to hitch to New York?
9) 351) dialog: Aren't you at least going to comment?
9) 353) dialog: Why?
9) 355) dialog: It's unfair that I'm in love with you?
9) 357) dialog: So?  People change.
9) 359) dialog: But that's every relationship!   There's always going to be a period of  adjustment.
9) 361) dialog: If this is a crush... then I don't  know if I could take the real thing if  it ever happens.
9) 364) text: She walks away.  Holden stands there, at a loss.  Then he turns and heads back to his car.   As he reaches the door and turns to look back at her,  Alyssa pounces on him, grabs his face and locks lips with him, big time.  He drops his keys and embraces her. And there they stand, by the side of the road, drenched  kissing.
9) 368) dialog: (getting up) Stay here. (he kisses her and exits)
9) 373) dialog: You looked weirded out back there.
9) 375) dialog: Sorry.
9) 377) dialog: She had boxers on.
9) 380) dialog: You don't know that.
9) 382) dialog: But we have read about them.  So we're  prepared.
9) 384) dialog: Maybe it is for her as well.
9) 386) dialog: Everyone's not out to get someone in  life.  Bank.
9) 388) dialog: Yourself?
9) 390) dialog: To what end?
9) 392) dialog: She's not going to ruin the comic.
9) 394) text: Banky walks away.  Holden shakes his head.
9) 430) dialog: Can I ask you something?
9) 432) dialog: Why me - you know?  Why now?
9) 434) dialog: You know what I'm talking about.
9) 436) dialog: I'm a guy.  You're attracted to girls.
9) 438) dialog: Then why this?
9) 440) dialog: Still am.
9) 442) dialog: (beat) Shit.
9) 444) dialog: Well, you took the luster our of it.
9) 446) dialog: (joking - in case you didn't  get it) Of how I brought you back from the  other side.  How all you needed was  the right man to turn you around.
9) 448) text: She snuggles into him and closes her eyes.  Holden stares at the ceiling.
9) 449) dialog: Can I at least cell people that all  you needed was some serious deep- dicking?
9) 451) text: 1) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves in various  directions, shaking her head accordingly.  Then she puts  up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden, hanging the  picture.  Alyssa gave him.   It hangs at a severely crooked angle.  He looks back to  her and shakes his head 'no'. 2) Holden and Alyssa try to play a video game.  Banky  plays as well.  Holden instructs her in the ways of NHL  '96 (turning her paddle right-side-up, pointing at things on the screen).  She presses the reset button, over and  over.  Banky gives Holden a 'What the fuck?' look.   Alyssa sticks her tongue at him. 3) At the Video Store - Holden picks up a Disney cartoon  off the shelf.  He goes to show if to Alyssa, who's  reading the back of 'Anything But Dick', an allchick  porno.  An old WOMAN stares at her.  Holden nods to the  old Woman and takes the tape out of Alyssa's hands,  putting it back on the shelf.  He ushers her away.  The  old Woman waits until they're gone and then picks up the  tape herself, 4) Holden carries Alyssa on his shoulders through the  park, her crotch against the back of his neck.  He's  talking. She taps him and he stops and looks up.  She  begins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face.   He pulls her off and put her down.  She's laughing.  He's flushed with embarrassment.  The same Old Woman from the  Video store passes by with her husband.  Holden shrugs. 5) In Holden's Apartment again - Alyssa again with the  waving, then putting up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden again, this time with the painting hung completely upside down.  He looks at it, then offers her a bewildered gaze. 6) In the Office Banky comes to his drawing table.  There are penciled pages on it with a note that says "Hanging  out with Alyssa today.  Holden".  Banky crumples it up  and throws it across the room. 7) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves this way, then  that way, then puts up her hands frantically to stop.   She settles back against the wall, a satisfied smile  crawling across her face, and closes her eyes.  We pull  back to reveal Holden on his knees in front of her,  eating her out (no, we don't see anything!).
9) 454) text: Holden looks down at that book.  It's the Nineteen Eighty Eight yearbook from Middletown North.  He shakes his head at Banky and flips it open. On the page is Alyssa's Senior year photo.  Under her  name is another name in quotes that says 'Finger Cuffs'.
9) 455) dialog: (looking up) So?
9) 457) dialog: 'Finger Cuffs'.
9) 459) dialog: And... she had a weird nick-name.   What's your point?
9) 461) dialog: I suppose you do.
9) 463) dialog: Yeah.
9) 467) text: BACK IN THE OFFICE - Holden stares at Banky.
9) 468) dialog: He's full of shit.
9) 470) dialog: She's never even been with a guy.
9) 472) dialog: He's pulling your chain.  And the fact  that you even bought it for a second  makes you look like an idiot.
9) 474) dialog: I give a shit what people think.
9) 476) dialog: (grabs his coat) You're such a fucking asshole.
9) 478) dialog: Would you let this go?  I'm telling  you - she's never even been with a  guy, let alone those two zeroes.
9) 480) text: Holden grabs Banky and pins him against the wall.
9) 481) dialog: Give it a rest!  Do you hear me?!  I'm  tired of this shit!  She's my goddamn  girlfriend, do you understand?!  Show  her a little fucking respect!   And if you ever even so much as  mention that Alyssa looks a little  peaked from now on, I'll put your  fucking teeth down your throat!
9) 484) dialog: (walking out) Not bloody Likely.
9) 490) dialog: Sulking.  He's having a real problem  with this Alyssa thing.
9) 492) dialog: Banky does not hate gays, you know  that.
9) 494) dialog: You make it sound like me and him were  dating.
9) 496) dialog: (beat) He's been digging up dirt on Alyssa.
9) 498) dialog: He heard some bullshit story that she  took on two guys.
9) 500) dialog: Have it. (beat) Actually, it's kind of gotten to me.
9) 502) dialog: Banky's not known for believing  misinformation.  He's got a pretty  good bullshit detector.
9) 504) dialog: Sex with multiple partners?
9) 506) dialog: At the same time.
9) 508) dialog: Thanks for being so comforting.
9) 510) dialog: Well that's the thing, isn't it?  I  shouldn't.. but it gets to me.
9) 512) dialog: You see - that doesn't bother me.  But  the thought of her and guys... Uh!
9) 514) dialog: Which is?
9) 516) dialog: Do I detect a little inter-subculture  cattiness?
9) 518) dialog: I thought fags were all supposed to be  super-supportive of one another.
9) 520) dialog: Three strikes.
9) 527) text: The Kid offers Holden an angry look.  Hooper gives him  back his comic.
9) 532) dialog: What do you mean?
9) 534) dialog: I can accept that.
9) 536) text: Hooper trots off, Holden glances at the disc in his  hands.  Pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks, barely  clad, making out.  The title is 'Men Suck.. and so do  Girls - All XXX Action.'
9) 539) dialog: What do you mean, 'visitors'?
9) 541) dialog: So that was until recently!
9) 543) dialog: So nobody bur me has stayed the night  at your place since we got together?
9) 545) dialog: No, I was just wondering,
9) 547) dialog: Look, I was just asking.
9) 549) text: ON THE ICE - Things heat up between two opposing PLAYERS. One snatches the puck away from the other and skates off. The other Player gives chase. Alyssa's very into the game.  Holden shakes his head
9) 550) dialog: That'd make Banky half right.
9) 552) dialog: He said all the girls from North were  bitches and sluts.
9) 554) dialog: (under his breath) How about your yearbook.
9) 557) dialog: What's with 'Finger Cuffs'?
9) 559) dialog: Yeah.  In your senior yearbook your  nickname was 'Finger Cuffs'.  What is  that?
9) 561) dialog: Do you know Rick Derris?
9) 562) text: ON THE ICE - The Players skid into the corner where  Player One checks Player Two into the boards, hard.   Player Two scrambles to his feet and throws down his  gloves. The crowd around Alyssa and Holden go wild.
9) 564) dialog: Did you go out with him or something?
9) 566) dialog: Just... you and him?
9) 568) dialog: Cohee?
9) 570) text: ON THE ICE - The Players square off.  Player Two pulls  Player One's helmet off and punches him in the face. Holden looks as if he'd Like to do the same to his  companion.  Alyssa's into the game.
9) 572) text: ON THE ICE - Player Two yanks at Player One's jersey and  gut punches him.  Alyssa seems oblivious to Holden's  anger, so enthralled with the action is she.
9) 574) text: ON THE ICE - Player One staggers a bit, then quickly  rights his jersey and lunges at Player Two, landing a  barrage of his own punches.  Blood sprays across the ice. Holden's face is reeeeeaaaally sour looking.  Alyssa's  still in the game.
9) 575) dialog: Rick pulled his dick out?  Really?   What'd you do?
9) 577) text: ON THE ICE - Player One delivers the kill shot, slamming  his fist into Player Two's nose.  The blood shoots out  like a geyser, and Two goes down hard. Holden stares at Alyssa, flabbergasted.  The crowd around them stares not at the fight on the ice, but the fight in their midst, shocked.  Alyssa fumes.
9) 578) dialog: Excuse me!?!
9) 582) text: She storms away.  Holden chases after her.  The Bystander watches them go.
9) 585) dialog: So it's true?!
9) 587) dialog: How the hell could you do those  things?!
9) 589) dialog: How am I supposed to feel about all of  this?
9) 591) dialog: I don't know how I feel about you now.
9) 593) dialog: Some sex?
9) 595) dialog: There's a world of fucking difference  between typical high school sex and  two guys at once!  They fucking used  you?
9) 599) text: Holden's eyes are downcast.  Alyssa waits for a response.
9) 600) dialog: I want us to be something that we  can't.
9) 602) dialog: (beat) A normal couple.
9) 603) text: Holden skulks off.  Alyssa stares after him, and then  starts kicking and punching a car beside her, finally  slumping to the ground.  She cries.
9) 606) text: Holden nods.  Banky nods back.  He stands there for a  beat.  Then he sits beside Holden.  He opens his arms.   Holden shifts into his friend's embrace and begins crying on his shoulder.  Banky pats his back.  Pull back on a  man in pain and the comfort of a friend.
9) 609) text: Holden looks up.  JAY and SILENT BOB stand above him.
9) 611) text: Holden offers a half-smile.  The pair slide into the  booth.
9) 612) dialog: What took you so long?
9) 614) text: Holden pulls an envelope out of his jacket and tosses it  to Jay.  Jay opens it and pulls out a thick wad of bills, along with the latest issue of 'BLUNTMAN and CHRONIC.'
9) 616) dialog: How'd a dirt merchant like you ever  learn about likeness rights?
9) 618) dialog: I'll pass.  Take a look at the issue.
9) 621) dialog: I'll see what I can do.
9) 624) dialog: Nothing, thanks.
9) 626) dialog: When is he not?  No - I'm just having  some girl trouble.
9) 628) dialog: No.  I'm just at a point where I don't  know what to do.
9) 630) dialog: Can't do it, g.  I'm in love.
9) 632) dialog: Just what I needed - advice from the  'hood
9) 634) dialog: I don't think you know her.
9) 636) dialog: You sound like Barbra Streisand.
9) 638) dialog: I'm telling you, you don't know her.
9) 640) dialog: Alyssa Jones.
9) 642) text: Holden rubs his eyes.
9) 644) dialog: She is.  Or was.  I don't know.
9) 649) dialog: It's not like that.
9) 651) dialog: Right now? (beat) I don't know.  I love her.  But she  has a past
9) 653) dialog: Eat your fucking bagel already!
9) 655) dialog: The problem is shit like that.  It was  one thing when it was just girls -  that was weird enough.  But now you  throw guys into the mix - two guys at  once, no less.  All that  experience...What am I supposed to  think?
9) 657) dialog: Settling.  That's comforting, Jay.   Thanks.
9) 659) dialog: I'm lust having a problem with all of  it I can't get it out of my head these  visuals of her doing all this shit.   And I don't know why I can't let it  go.  Because I'm crazy about her, you  know?  I look at this girl, I see the  future.  I see kids.  I see grand- kids.
9) 661) dialog: I'm scaring myself.  Because I think  so much of her,  and then I can't get  over shit like 'Finger Cuffs'. (shakes his head) I don't know what I'm doing.
9) 662) text: Holden looks out the window.  Jay continues to roll his  joint.  There's silence. Then...
9) 664) text: Holden's head snaps forward.  He stares, wide-eyed at  Silent Bob.
9) 665) dialog: What..what did you say?
9) 667) text: Holden stares, shocked.  He looks to Jay, who's still  rolling his joint.
9) 674) text: Jay and Holden look at him.  Silent Bob busts a move with his hands.
9) 687) dialog: What's there?
9) 689) dialog: I don't know.  I don't know if the  book's going to be around much longer.
9) 691) dialog: Are you kidding me?  There's millions  of people out there that'd love to see  themselves in a comic book.
9) 693) dialog: Snootchie-bootchies.
9) 695) dialog: I'll try.
9) 698) text: Exit Jay and Silent Bob.  Holden remains in the booth,  thinking.
9) 701) dialog: I know you're wondering why I asked  you both here tonight, at the same  time, knowing that we have shit to  settle between us, separately.
9) 705) dialog: Enough! (they both look at him) I've been going through things, over  and over.  And I dissected it all, and  looked at it a thousand different  ways.  Banky - there's friction  between us for the first time in our  lives.  You hate me dating Alyssa and  you want me to sign off on this M-TV  thing.
9) 707) dialog: Alyssa - you and I hit a wall, because  I don't know how to deal with... your  past, I guess.
9) 709) dialog: (right in his face) I'm only going to say it once: shut  up. (back to pacing) Now - I know I'm to blame one way or  the other on both accounts.  With you,  Alyssa - it's my fault because I feel  inadequate.  Because you've had so  much experience, had such a big life;  and my life's been pretty small in  comparison.
9) 711) dialog: Please.  I have to get through this. (beat) And with you Banky - I know why you're  having such a hard time with Alyssa,  and it's something that's been obvious  forever, but I guess I just didn't  acknowledge it. (takes a deep breath) You're in love with me.
9) 713) dialog: You're attracted to me.  Just as, in a  way, I'm attracted to you.  I mean, it  makes sense - we've been together so  long, we have so much in common...
9) 715) text: Holden grabs him, kisses him full on the lips, and pushes him back onto the couch Alyssa reacts.  Banky - wide-eyed and speechless - looks away.
9) 716) dialog: It's something you're going to have to  deal with.  Bank.  You may very well  be gay, which explains your homophobia  and why you're so jealous of Alyssa,  and your sense of humor as well.
9) 718) dialog: Bank.  Stop.  Deal with it.  You'll  feel much better.
9) 720) dialog: Now - at this point, you may be asking  yourself the question that I've been  going over and over in my head for the  last few days: what does one have to  do with the other?
9) 723) dialog: And when I did some serious soul- searching, it came at me from out of  nowhere, and suddenly it all made  sense - a calm came over me.  I know  what we have to do.  And then you -  Bank, you Alyssa, and I - all of us...  can finally be... alright.
9) 725) dialog: (sits in the chair; takes a  long beat) We've all got to have sex together.
9) 726) text: The room is silent.  Holden Lights a cigarette.  Banky's  eyes nearly bug.   Alyssa's  head drops.
9) 727) dialog: Don't you see?  That would take care  of everything.  Alyssa - I wouldn't  feel inadequate or too conservative  anymore.  I'll have done something on  par with all the experience you've  had.  And it'll be with you, which'll  make it that much more powerful.  And  Banky - you can cake that leap that  everyone else but you sees that you  should take.  And it'll be okay,  because it'll be with me - your best  friend for years.  We've been  everything to each other but  intimates.  And now, we'll have been  through that together too.  And it  won't have to be a total leap for you,  because a woman will be involved.  And  when it's over, all that aggression  you feel toward Alyssa will be gone.   Because you'll have shared in  something beautiful with the woman I  love.  It'll be cathartic.  A true  communion.  We have to do this.  For  me, for both of you... for all of our  sakes.  This will keep us together. (beat) What do you say?

9) 742) dialog: You can.  I'll be there.  And when  it's over, we'll be the strongest  we've ever been because we got through  some nasty shit together.  And we'll  finally be on the same level together.   And then there'll be nothing we can't  accomplish.
9) 745) dialog: No it won't.  I thought about all of  that.
