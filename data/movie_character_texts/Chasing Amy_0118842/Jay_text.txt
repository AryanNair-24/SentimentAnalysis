9) 635) dialog: Come on man - I'm people who know  people.
9) 637) dialog: That's 'cause I got this tubby bitch  playing her greatest hits tape in my  ear all the time.

9) 667) text: Holden stares, shocked.  He looks to Jay, who's still  rolling his joint.
9) 668) dialog: What do you look so shocked for?  He  does this all the time.  Fat bastard  thinks just because he never says  anything, that it'll have some huge  impact when he does open his fucking  mouth.
9) 670) dialog: When?
9) 672) dialog: What'd she 'Live in Canada' or  something?  Why don't I remember this?

9) 685) text: They sit there for a beat.  Jay pockets the rest of his  dime-bag.
9) 686) dialog: Enough of this fucking melodrama.  My  advice - forget her, dude.  There's  one woman in the world.  One woman,  with many faces. (to Silent Bob) Get up, bitch (to Holden) We gotta book.  We're catching a bus  to Chi-town.
9) 688) dialog: Business, yo.  How many more of those  phat envelopes do we got coming to us?
9) 690) dialog: Yeah?  Good.  I'll be glad as shit  when it's gone.
9) 692) dialog: I know.  I spend every fucking waking  hour with one of them.  But it ain't  like us at all - all slapsticky and  shit - running around like dicks,  saying... What's that shit you got me  saying?
9) 694) dialog: 'Snootchie-bootchies'.  Who talks like  that?  That's baby-talk. (slaps his hand) It's a big world, g - but we're bound  to run into you again.  Until then -  keep your unit on you.
9) 697) dialog: (slaps him) Knock it off!  Get your fat ass moving  - we got a bus to catch. (under his breath) Jedi-bitch.
