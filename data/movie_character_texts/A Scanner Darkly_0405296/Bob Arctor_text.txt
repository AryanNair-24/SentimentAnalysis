He passes a McDonald's, a 7-11, a mirrored office building, pulls a pill box from his pocket, and surreptitiously swallows two capsules. He studies his reflection in the office building. Behind him on the stre are the disapproving reflections of passing straights. He blends back into the flow of foot traffic. A grungy hippy smiles at him. Arctor nods, passes another McDonald's. He passes a third McDonald's almost immediately. BOB ARCTOR
