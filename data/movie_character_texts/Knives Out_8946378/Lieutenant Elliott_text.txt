The young Trooper Wagner stands behind him. Sitting back behind both of them, almost blending into th background, is a slight man in a linen suit. Legs and arm fold sharply, like a paper crane. Silent, listening.
11) 1) dialog: We are just going to reintroduce ourselves as a formality, I'm Detective Lieutenant Elliott, and this is Trooper Wagner. Now, I'm going to record, just makes it easier. (squints at his phone) Alright, we're with Linda Drysdale, nee Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's eldest daughter, in discussing the events the night of his demise, one week ago, November 8th.
11) 4) dialog: So we understand that night the family had gathered to celebrate your father's eighty fifth birthday.
11) 6) dialog: How was that?
12) 1) dialog: Did anyone besides the family show face?
12) 3) dialog: (wow) His mom? How old is she?
12) 5) dialog: Okay, Your son Ransom, was he there as well?

13) 5) dialog: (checks notes) Sorry. Right.
13) 7) dialog: Just like your dad. You two were very close?
13) 10) dialog: I don't know, do they?
15) 1) dialog: Seems like all his kids are self made overachievers. Richard makes a "...sure" face.
15) 4) dialog: For the record, I'm speaking to Walt Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's youngest son. LIEUTENANT ELLIOTT (cont'd) So you run your father's publishing company?
15) 8) dialog: You live in town, right? You guys probably arrived at around the same time? Walt looks at Linen suit, thrown.
17) 4) dialog: So the night went well?
19) 3) dialog: So we are with Joni Thrombey, Harlan Thrombey's... daughter in law?
19) 5) dialog: And you remained close to the Thrombeys.

21) 3) dialog: Ah! Yeah Flam, right, your skin care company. Sorry.
21) 6) dialog: You left his party early?
23) 2) dialog: Right. You two arrived together to the party at the same time? Joni looks at the linen suit man.
23) 4) dialog: Just some follow up questions, just being thorough, in order to determine the manner of death. Cut back to Walt in the chair.
23) 6) dialog: None of us think that, this is pro forma, all of it. CUT TO: Richard in the chair. He doesn't buy it.
23) 8) dialog: This is Benoit Blanc.

36) 2) dialog: Why don't we take a breather.
39) 1) dialog: Maybe I'm a victim of my own expectations. But when the great Benoit Blanc knocks on my door, I expect it's going to be for something... if not extraordinary, at least interesting. This is an open and shut case of suicide. (checks watch) And Benny we're at the point where I need to know what we're doing here. Blanc notices the OLD BASEBALL lying in the grass. He pic it up idly. 24.
39) 3) dialog: Dramatic. But look around. The guy practically lives in a CLUE board.
40) 1) dialog: You ask me to drag all these good people back for questioning, go over it all again, I don't get it. This is a pleasant family with the usual quarrels but no possible motives for murder - where are you going? At that moment, BLANC's face appears right next to Marta' staring right at her through the distorted glass. She yel and falls back.
41) 12) dialog: Blanc.
43) 6) dialog: Even if it's true... you ok? 27. Marta gives a weak thumbs up, recovering
45) 3) dialog: Ok don't answer that if you're going to puke. Please. But Blanc presses.
45) 6) dialog: An allowance as a motive, Blanc. She has her business. More weak sauce. Blanc idly scratches a spot on the side of his neck.
45) 8) dialog: Three?
45) 10) dialog: I see where you are going with this.
45) 13) dialog: Yes, please just wait inside but stay close. She steps back in, grateful. Blanc to Elliott:
45) 15) dialog: Who?
45) 17) dialog: So who hired you?
45) 22) dialog: We know, the party broke up at 11:30.
46) 1) dialog: Marta took Harlan upstairs to give him his meds, Richard and Linda and Joni went right to bed. Now we do have this: the stairs leading up to Harlan's bedroom and his attic office creak horribly.
47) 1) dialog: And Linda is a light sleeper. So we know every time someone took the stairs that night.
48) 1) dialog: The first was when Joni heard a ka- THUNK from somewhere above her in the house. Ka-THUNK! Joni looks up at the ceiling.
49) 1) dialog: She's concerned about Harlan, she went up to investigate. Waking Linda.
51) 1) dialog: Harlan was in his attic office with Marta. He explained that they had just knocked the GO board over - that game with the grid and stones, they play it every night, and he was fine, go to bed. So she does. The spilled GO board on the floor.

55) 1) dialog: Harlan. Who came down for midnight snacks, which Walt tried to discourage.
55) 3) dialog: Based on this, the medical examiner determined time of death to be between 12:15 and 2am. As Walt was finishing his cigar, about 12:30, Meg came home. She went straight to bed. Walt and Jacob turned in shortly after that. Meg pulls up, trots past Walt and Jacob and inside.
56) 1) dialog: Sometime later that night, undetermined but possibly near 3am, Meg woke up because the dogs were barking outside. She used the bathroom and went back to bed. 33.
57) 1) dialog: And that's it. Everyone's stories matched, every movement accounted for.
57) 3) dialog: No. Just the creaky one. Blanc seems intrigued by this.
57) 6) dialog: Except it was a suicide. Harlan hit both carotids, we saw from the blood blood splat patterns that they were uninterrupted. Meaning, It's almost impossible for anyone to have been around him at the time. He's the one that cut his own throat. I don't know why we keep going over this.
57) 8) dialog: What?
76) 0) text: Blanc catches his coin. Lieutenant Elliott and Trooper Wagner look up at Marta, expectant. Just a brief moment h passed since we left them.
76) 2) dialog: What medication did he get? Marta chooses her words very carefully:
76) 4) dialog: Anything unusual about his demeanor? Uh oh. Marta keeps it solid. Superhuman effort. 47.
93) 3) dialog: (to Proofroc) Can we see the actual TAPE?
94) 2) dialog: (dry) Awesome. Blanc the grounds are lovely but you think what, someone broke into the house? To kill Harlan? Is that why we're out here?
95) 1) dialog: Any luck with - whatshisname?
95) 11) dialog: Alright, Wagner let's get the boys on it, check the prints, tape off this area, keep it clear. The dogs come running down the lawn, barking at the men. They tear through the gate, further messing up the mud.
95) 14) dialog: They're doing the will reading at ten, whole family will be here soon. Elliott heads up towards the house. Blanc meanders up the lawn, and Marta follows.
97) 0) text: The man kicks off the dogs and limps toward the house, cursing. Lieutenant Elliott and Trooper Wagner step out onto the porch.
97) 1) dialog: Hugh Drysdale? 62.
97) 3) dialog: I'm Lieutenant Elliott, this is officer Wagner, we'd like to ask you a few questions about the night of
98) 3) dialog: Blanc, anything you need to ask him?
104) 6) dialog: Depending on when it was last cleaned, it could be from anytime 69.
105) 3) dialog: He's gently requesting, I'm ordering. Nobody move until we figure this out. Nobody likes this.
124) 2) dialog: Five AM, security systems here was all triggered. It went up quick. Blood stores, records, all gone. No employees around, thank god.
124) 4) dialog: And speaking of security, the security tape from the Thrombey residence was scrambled. For some reason. Blanc unsurprised. He motions back to the building.
124) 6) dialog: The report on the blood work.
135) 1) dialog: That was the dumbest car chase of all time. Put your hands down.
135) 3) dialog: Mr. Drysdale, come with us please. Elliott leads Ransom off by the elbow. Ransom throws a lo back at Marta - he has no idea what's going on.
135) 7) dialog: Blanc. Coming with us?

150) 3) dialog: What - with - what?
150) 7) dialog: Blanc c'mon, what's all this Drama.
150) 12) dialog: Blanc I understand that this is amusing for you -
150) 14) dialog: Someone fishing for any crime that could help reverse the will.
150) 18) dialog: Did someone in the family see Marta doing something suspicious? 106.
161) 9) dialog: Hot damn.
167) 2) dialog: Benny look I hear what you are saying Trooper Wagner quickly shushs Elliott, enthralled by ever word Blanc says.
