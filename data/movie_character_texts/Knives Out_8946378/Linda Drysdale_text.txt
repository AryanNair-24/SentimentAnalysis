The young Trooper Wagner stands behind him. Sitting back behind both of them, almost blending into th background, is a slight man in a linen suit. Legs and arm fold sharply, like a paper crane. Silent, listening.

13) 6) dialog: I built my business from the ground up.
13) 8) dialog: We had our own secret way of communicating. You had to find that with dad. You had to find a game to play with him. And if you did that, and played by his rules... CUT TO: Richard in the chair Linda was in, giving his statement.

23) 15) dialog: Who?
23) 17) text: BLANC (cont'd) You will find me a respectful, quiet, passive observer. Of the truth. Elliott and Wagner turn nervously back to Linda. She doesn't look thrilled. Cut to Richard.
25) 5) dialog: Thank you.
25) 7) dialog: Well. Blanc pauses. Doesn't push anything. Just waits a moment. LINDA (cont'd) Yes. I mean. Walt, yeah. He's done well with what dad's given him. Walt - not like it matters but he was sort of adrift, dad gave him the job, but really dad hands him a book twice a year and Walt publishes it, I mean... it's just not the same.
25) 9) dialog: Are you baiting me, Detective? You know he doesn't, and you think I'm dumb enough to be baited into talking family business, into shit talking my brother in front of a police detective and a state trooper - Richard in the chair.

38) 1) dialog: Richard! Alone, Richard waits very still for Linda's footsteps to walk away, then when he knows she's not coming in he furtively rifles through desk drawers, finding various ridiculous ephemera. He finds a small locked drawer, jimmies it open with a letter opener. Inside - the small pink envelope Harlan threatened him wi in his flashback. He rips it open, pulls out the card inside.

79) 2) dialog: I was just thinking about Dad's games. This all feels like one, it feels like something he'd write, not do. I keep waiting for a big reveal, where it all makes sense. How nice would that be? Her little brother hugs her. His eyes tired and dark. 48.

Meg talking to Lieutenan Elliott, crying. She's just learned about Fran. Linda watches the circus, strangely disconnected, going t light a cigarette. With a strange smirk, she uses the fla to warm the blank note from the office, and HIDDEN WRITIN starts to appear - a note from her father. Their secret communication. As the letters appear, her face changes.
