0) 3) text: Holden doesn't answer.  He's centering Leon's eye on the machine.
0) 5) dialog: Don't move.
0) 9) dialog: (cutting in) Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
0) 10) text: Leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly. Holden's voice is cold, geared to intimidate and evoke response.
0) 11) dialog: You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
0) 14) dialog: What?
0) 16) dialog: Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
0) 18) dialog: Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
0) 20) dialog: Know what a turtle is?
0) 22) dialog: Same thing.
0) 24) text: He sees Holden's patience is wearing thin.
0) 26) dialog: You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
0) 27) text: Keeping an eye on his subject, Holden notes the dials in the Voight-Kampff.  One of the needles quivers slightly.
0) 29) text: Disregarding the question, Holden continues, picking up the pace.
0) 30) dialog: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over.  But it can't.  Not without your help.  But you're not helping.
0) 33) dialog: I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
0) 34) text: Leon looks shocked, surprised.  But the needles in the computer barely move.  Holden goes for the inside of his coat.  But big Leon is faster.  His LASER BURNS a hole the size of a nickel through Holden's stomach. Unlike a bullet, a laser causes no impact.  It goes through Holden's spine and comes out his back, clean as a whistle.  Like a rag doll he falls back off the bench from the waist up.  By the time he hits the floor, big slow Leon is already walking away.  But he stops, turns and with a little smile of satisfaction, FIRES at the machine on the table. There's a flash and a puff of smoke.  The Voight-Kampff is hit dead center, crippled but not destroyed; as Leon walks out of the room, one of its lights begins to blink, faint but steady.
76) 0) text: Holden is laid out in an apparatus that resembles an iron lung.  A little above his head, facing him, is a bank of bio-feedback lights registering body functions. Deckard is in a chair sitting next to his friend. Holden has lost weight, his face is grey, he can't move his head, but he's smiling like the cat who ate the canary.
76) 2) text: Holden's voice is just a whisper -- the kind of whisper that comes out of the joker at the back of the class.
76) 3) dialog: I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
76) 5) text: Holden's eyes close, his smile gets bigger and little spasms of laughter pump out of his mouth.
76) 6) dialog: Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
76) 8) dialog: Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
76) 10) dialog: From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
76) 12) dialog: Money?
76) 14) dialog: Let's hear it.
76) 16) text: Holden giggles.  Starts to laugh again.  A blue light on the panel begins to turn very bright.  They both notice it.
76) 18) dialog: I'm taking a piss.
76) 20) dialog: Let me ask you something, Deck. You been having intimate relations with one of these units?
76) 21) text: Deckard doesn't deny it.  Holden smiles like a cherub.
76) 22) dialog: That's what I thought... one of the liabilities of the trade -- you has sex with your prey, old buddy.  That's bound to create problems, unless you're a black widow.
76) 25) text: Holden bites his bottom lip to keep the laugher out of his voice, but he can't.
76) 26) dialog: Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
76) 28) dialog: I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
76) 29) text: Holden stops talking for a moment to get some air.
76) 30) dialog: Believe me, take it from an old pro, no matter how good we get, we're never gonna make an artificial anything that can feel.  It's a contradiction. You might as well go fuck your washing machine.
76) 31) text: Holden laughs, Deckard doesn't.
76) 32) dialog: Just go out there and keep up the good work.
76) 33) text: Holden's whispers have become harder to hear.
76) 34) dialog: Got to save it, Deck, I'm getting sleepy.  It's been good talking to you.
