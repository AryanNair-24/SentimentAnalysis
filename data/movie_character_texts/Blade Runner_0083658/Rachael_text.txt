30) 5) dialog: Hello, Mr. Deckard.  My name is Rachael.
31) 0) text: No woman can be all things to all men, the Rachael comes closer than most.  The only trouble is she's all busi- ness.  Formidable without really trying.  Some beauty is better avoided and Deckard looks straight ahead.
32) 1) dialog: It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
32) 3) dialog: But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
33) 1) dialog: You like our owl?
33) 2) text: Deckard nods.  Rachael claps her hands.  The owl opens its yellow eyes and blinks at them.
33) 4) dialog: Of course not.
33) 6) dialog: You're in a very unique position, Mr. Deckard.  You could affect the future of this entire organization according to how you work your little test.
33) 8) dialog: Are you apprehensive?
33) 10) dialog: For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
34) 0) text: The office is dimly lit, but highlights of resilience reside in the luster of the antique furnishings, like glimmers of gold in a darkened mine.  Dr. Tyrell is a fragile man of power, with that look of "youth" obtained from steroids and surgery.  Dapper and trim, he leans against the desk looking at an old fashioned pocket watch.  The only sound is the insidious PERKING of COFFEE BREWING in the background. Tyrell taps a sensor on his desk.  The door in front of Deckard and Rachael slides open.  They enter a vestibule and face another door, this one befitting the decor of the office, Tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as they enter.
34) 1) dialog: Mr. Deckard.  Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
34) 22) text: Deckard stares at Rachael, then back at Tyrell.  Delighte Tyrell takes a cup of coffee. Accepting the challenge, Deckard opens his briefcase and starts fishing out the apparatus.
34) 25) dialog: Go ahead.
34) 26) text: In the soft green glow of the dials, the needles in both gauges are at rest.  Dr. Tyrell stands silhouetted behind Deckard, who sits in front of Rachael, a pencil beam trained on her eye.  Wire mesh discs are attached to her cheeks.
34) 29) dialog: I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
34) 32) dialog: I'd take him to the doctor.
34) 34) dialog: I'd kill it.
34) 37) dialog: Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
34) 41) dialog: I should be enough for him.
34) 44) dialog: I'd never get an abortion.
34) 46) dialog: That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
34) 48) dialog: It would be my child.
34) 52) dialog: Ugh.
34) 63) text: Rachael sits very still.  Except her eyes -- they go to Tyrell and hang on.  He stares back at her as he speaks.
34) 66) text: Rachael sits rigidly in her chair, as the ground crumbles around her, her big mermaid eyes locked with Tyrell. His voice is quiet and strong, mesmerizing.  She's hang- ing by a thread. Deckard watches with a bas taste in his mouth.
34) 69) text: Rachael nods fixedly.  Careful not to let go her grasp.
34) 72) text: Slowly, carefully, Tyrell unlocks his gaze from Rachael and turns towards Deckard, who is starting to put away his equipment.
34) 86) text: Rachael sits there very pale and expressionless, her feet flat on the floor, alone is the word. Trying to keep the fury out of it, Deckard's voice comes out in a whisper.
34) 88) text: On the last word, Rachael glances up at him and Deckard turns away. The outer door slides open and he goes through it.
52) 0) text: He slips on the light and crosses the front room. Deckard is a pack rat -- hard to tell if he just moved in or is just moving out. As he enters the kitchen, the SOUND of SOMEBODY BEHIND him causes him to whirl around fast, hand snapped out in front of him, gun already in it.  Rachael almost got shot.  But she's unruffled, a little pale maybe, but direct as ever.  There's a long, chilly moment, then she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the floor.
52) 1) dialog: Was that your dinner?
52) 3) dialog: I'm sorry.  I called and found out you were on your way home.  These were already delivered to your department but I thought you should have copies as soon as possible.
52) 5) dialog: It's the Nexus information you wanted.
52) 10) dialog: I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
52) 12) dialog: I think you need more help than you've got.
52) 14) dialog: There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
52) 16) dialog: Two of us might be more effective than one.
52) 19) dialog: No you don't.
52) 21) dialog: You use your equipment, don't you?
52) 23) dialog: So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
52) 24) text: It's a strong look that passes between them -- a long one.  Maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do something about such an offer but... Deckard's eyes follow her down as Rachael bends to the floor and starts picking the food off the rug, put- ting it back on the plate.
52) 27) dialog: Do I make you nervous?
52) 29) dialog: I'm sorry.
52) 31) dialog: It's strange to suddenly realize that what you thought was your life is actually someone else's fabrication.
52) 34) dialog: Can you?  I couldn't.
52) 36) dialog: A part of me is glad.  I think I feel more.  I don't like who I was before.
52) 40) dialog: They probably want to find out when they were made.
52) 43) dialog: I guess the date of your birth is important if you know you're not made to last.
52) 45) dialog: That's my number.  If you need me.
52) 47) dialog: You better get better locks -- if you want to keep me out.
52) 49) dialog: Good night.
52) 52) text: He looks down at the number.  It's the back side of a snapshot.   He turns it over.  The picture of a man and a woman.  The little girl between them looks like a six-year old Rachael.
68) 20) text: Deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles, protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the next one. Leon folds his big hands together and raises them over his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac- tion of smashing Deckard's skull. The spasm that runs through Leon's face is not from satisfaction.  It's the bullet that went through his neck.  He hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting the air like a rabid dog.  Dead. Rachael is standing in the alley.  Deckard lies there looking at her.  She comes slowly and quietly forward and drops Deckard's gun by his side. Deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get up, but can't quite manage it.  He looks up at her, panting, spits blood and almost smiles.
68) 23) dialog: You look terrible, you know that?
69) 5) text: He doesn't answer.  Lies there sipping his drink. Rachael comes in a little uncertain, a little droll, and stands there looking down at him.
69) 7) dialog: What do you want me to do?
69) 13) dialog: There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
69) 15) dialog: You're getting me wet.
72) 0) text: Deckard is on the edge of the couch with the phone on his knees, the card with Rachael's number in his lap and having no luck.
77) 0) text: He's sitting on the couch, glum, contemplative. There's a SOUND.  His eyes move to the door.  Those locks are opening again.  Rachael comes in.  Looks surprised to see him.  Him too.
77) 1) dialog: I told you I'd come back.
77) 3) dialog: You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
77) 5) dialog: Are you glad I'm here?
77) 7) dialog: Who is this?
77) 9) dialog: Where is he?
77) 11) dialog: Oh.
77) 13) dialog: How come you're not on the job?
77) 15) dialog: How are you doing?
77) 18) dialog: What do people do in the afternoon?
78) 0) text: They're under the sheet.  Rachael is on her back, look- ing at the ceiling, hair sprawled like sea grass over the pillow.  Deckard lies next to her, a man studying a treasure.
78) 1) dialog: Do you dream?
78) 3) dialog: I wish I could.
78) 7) dialog: I mean asleep.
78) 9) dialog: Did you cry when your father died?
78) 11) dialog: That's another thing I can't do.
78) 13) dialog: Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
78) 15) dialog: I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
78) 17) dialog: I don't know... I think I missed something.
78) 19) dialog: I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
80) 0) text: Rachael is lying across the bed in one of Deckard's shirts, her chin over the edge, her eyes moving around the room.  Deckard lies next to her.  Looking like a man who died a voluptuous death.
80) 1) dialog: When was the last time you cleaned this place?
80) 3) dialog: Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
80) 5) dialog: It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
80) 9) dialog: They could clean around the arrangement.
80) 13) text: Rachael lies there a moment, then gets up and goes into the front room and opens the closet door.  The vacuum is not easy to get to, but finally she wrestles it out.  As she starts to plug it in --
80) 16) dialog: But if I don't plug it in how can I...
80) 18) dialog: But then how can you...
80) 25) dialog: This feels stupid.
80) 28) dialog: You're sick, Deckard.
93) 0) text: Books scattered on the bed.  Rachael sitting cross- legged with one in her lap, looking through exquisite shots of nature.  Deckard is next to her, watching her like a lover, like a father.
93) 3) dialog: You and I are good friends, huh?
93) 5) dialog: It's so easy.
93) 7) dialog: Have you ever known anybody a long time?
93) 9) dialog: Uh-huh.
93) 11) dialog: Ten years.
93) 28) dialog: Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
93) 30) dialog: Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
93) 32) dialog: Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
93) 36) dialog: What difference will it make?
93) 39) dialog: You know what I think?
93) 41) dialog: That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
93) 43) dialog: You know what else I think?
93) 45) dialog: This was the best day of my life.
122) 0) text: In a corner of the dimness Deckard sits slumped on a chair, facing the pearly gray light of the window.  The only SOUND in the room is the soft steady BREATHING that comes from the bed. Quietly he gets up and walks over to her.  Rachael lies sleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet. Deckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down at her. Moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of the bed. Rachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles.
123) 0) text: Deckard's car is skimming over the narrow highway.  He and Rachael in the front seat.  Except for the occasion- al glance, their faces are still and quiet in the cold shine of an icy dream. The clouds overhead are soft and swift.
123) 2) text: Rachael's face in the window watching the woods stream by.
124) 0) text: Deckard and Rachael walking.  The land lays white and hushed before them. Down an aisle of maples and beeches.  The frosty light slanting through the clean, hard limbs. The crisp, blue-white snow underfoot melted through in spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth. Rachael stops and faces him.  Her lips are parted, her warm breath turning the cold air to vapor.  Looking lithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees, she stands in the crisp white snow looking at Deckard. Nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist on knowing.
