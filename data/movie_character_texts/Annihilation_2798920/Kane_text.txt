Images show him in uniform, with comrades, in a baked landscape of rock and dust. He smiles easily at the camera. Full of life in these fro snapshots. One of the images shows a wedding. LENA in white. The couple embracing. Another shows the couple in Verona. Perhaps the honeymoon
6) 1) text: LENA sits on the sofa. Legs curled beneath her. In one hand, she holds her SILVER LOCKET. It’s open. Inside is a PHOTO of KANE. She gazes at it. We can feel LENA’S effort to modulate her breathing. Inhaling and exhaling through parted lips. Less controlled, tears spill down her face. Down her chee and neck. Into the corner of her mouth.

LENA runs a primed roller over the wall. Leaving a fat wh stripe over the old colour. Flecking her shirt and face w paint. Smearing it off her forehead with the back of her hand. Repainting the room is an act of moving on. She is energised. Focused. So focused - - that she doesn’t see the figure that appears in the doo of the bedroom. KANE. He seems different to the photos. In uniform, but bloodle in his complexion. Older in his gaze. He watches LENA painting. Oddly blank. Not announcing his presence - - until she turns, needing to reload the roller - - and sees him. First, she jolts at the sight of the figure. Second, she recognises him.
8) 1) text: (whispers ) Oh God. The roller slips from her hand. Lands with a wet slap on the floor. She walks towards KANE. Puts a hand on his cheek, in the way she might touch a cl window to see if it holds a pane of glass. Then she grabs his face with both palms. Kissing him as s talks.

9) 21) dialog: I don’t know. Silence. As LENA suddenly understands: her husband is profoundly damaged. His body has returned to her, but not his mind. She takes a seat opposite him at the table. Then takes his hand. He doesn’t resist.

LENA stands beside him. She exhales, and steam wreathes h DR VENTRESS watches from behind an observation window. Th edges of the glass are frosted with ice crystals. LENA reaches for KANE’S hand. Holds it. A tear slips out of her eye. And freezes on her cheek.

A few metres away, RADEK and SHEPPARD sit at a table. SHEPPARD is studying one of her maps, and RADEK is making notes in a small pad. THORENSEN appears beside LENA.

53) 3) dialog: You hear that?
53) 5) dialog: They're coming back. KANE stands abruptly. Out of frame.
53) 6) dialog: Get to positions. The video jerks sideways as the CAMERAMAN moves. Then CUTS STRAIGHT TO - - an INTENSE night-time FIRE-FIGHT. KANE and two others soldier - PEYTON and SHELLY - are crouched behind a LOW WALL somewhere in the compound. They take turns to fire over the top of the wall. Faces l by muzzle flashes.

This time to the violent sway-motion of the CAMERAMAN running. The video CUTS again.

96) 0) text: - SHELLEY, lying in the grass, filmed by the CAMERAMAN. KANE and PEYTON stand either side. We can see that SHELLY has been shot in the chest. He’s not dead yet. He’s making a wheezing sound, as his punctured lungs collapse. Now that the camera is focused and steady, we can also se that SHELLEY has some extremely strange deformations. On his neck, there is a split, or opening. Effectively a large tracheotomy, shaped as a sideways mouth, running fr the concave skin above his collar bone to under his chin. Inside the mouth, where there might be a tongue, there is something fat and white and red. It looks like a skinned SNAKE. Air bubbles through the blood around it, and the SNAKE is writhing slowly. There are more deformations on SHELLEY'S arms. Each one i split, just below the elbow, into two. Each split has secondary protrusions, finger-like, at irregular intervals. PEYTON looks haunted. Jaw locked into a rictus.

97) 1) dialog: There. It’s coming again. Then an area of water is rising, as if forming a hill. Then the surface of the water breaks - - and a DOLPHIN launches itself into the air. The DOLPHIN is the size of a BLUE WHALE. The vast creature holds for a moment, suspended in mid-ai before gravity takes hold. Pulls it down with an almighty KANE turns to the CAMERAMAN. Wired. Wide-eyed.

He’s on all fours, head dipped, with his spine buckling a he’s retching. KANE isn’t helping. He just holds his rifle. Watching. Then PEYTON lifts his head - - revealing there is something wrong with the shape of hi skull. At this distance, it’s hard to tell what. Some kin of deformation that has elongated his face. Some words are exchanged between them. A beat. Then KANE shoots PEYTON. cuT TO -
101) 0) text: — KANE. He’s a long way distant from the camera. Standing waist-d in the ocean. After a few moments, KANE starts pounding the water with fists. Screaming and yelling.

104) 3) dialog: I had a life. People called me Kane. But now I’m not sure. Beat.
104) 4) dialog: If I wasn’t Kane, what was I? KANE looks at the CAMERAMAN.
104) 5) dialog: Was I you? Were you me? The CAMERAMAN doesn’t answer. KANE (CONT’D) My flesh moves like liquid. My mind is cut loose. Beat. Then KANE looks straight down the lens. His pupils glow like a cat’s eye in the infra-red light. 112. KANE (CONT’D) I can’t bear it. He opens his palm. He’s holding one of the cannister-shaped GRENADES. He glances up at the CAMERAMAN.
104) 6) dialog: Ever see a phosphorous grenade go off? Shield your eyes. They’re kind of bright. KANE hesitates.

It is unclear how it got there. A frozen beat. Then LENA STRIKES the HUMANOID with all her strength. And moment later, in a mirror of her actions - - the HUMANOID STRIKES HER BACK - but with incredible pow LENA is sent flying backwards across the room. She collides with the CAMERA and TRIPOD. All skid across the room to the wall. But it has provided LENA with a weapon. As the HUMANOID reapproaches her, she picks up the TRIPOD and swings it l a club, smashing the camera against the HUMANOID’S head. And again, the HUMANOID mirrors the actions. Using its ar like a club. For a second time, LENA is sent hurtling back across the by the force of the impact. But this time towards KANE’S BACKPACK. She collides with it, and the PHOSPHOROUS GRENADES beside 121. And as she gets to her feet, the HUMANOID is again on her Standing directly in front of her. Featureless, eyeless, somehow watching. Utterly, infinitely more powerful than she is. For the first time, we see something beaten in LENA. Something broken.
110) 3) dialog: Kane? Another beat. REVEAL - at LENA’S feet - the PHOSPHOROUS GRENADES. CLOSE, on LENA. Processing. Controlling herself. Then - slowly - - she reaches down. Opposite her, in a slightly delayed mirror action - - KANE does the same. LENA’S hand closes around one of the metal cannisters. KANE does the same. LENA rises again. Never taking her eyes off KANE’S face. KANE rises. A final beat. LENA watching KANE’S face.
116) 1) text: LENA enters. Closes the door behind her. 127. KANE looks round, and they lock eyes. Neither speak. After a moment, LENA goes to the WINDOW. Looks out at the NIGHT SKY.
