This time to the violent sway-motion of the CAMERAMAN running. The video CUTS again. Now the CAMERAMAN is crouched beside KANE who is by the corner of a building, who is hunched over as incoming rou hit the concrete. The firing is sustained - - then stops. Immediately KANE swings out and RETURNS FIRE. From somewhere nearby, over the noise of the firing we he screaming. Then PEYTON shouting:
55) 1) dialog: Cease fire! Cease fire! The video CUTS again. This time the CAMERAMAN is following SHELLEY. Now we’re in an interior. Which we recognise, as the video aperture corrects for th light - - as the BARRACKS. cuT TO -

He’s making a wheezing sound, as his punctured lungs collapse. Now that the camera is focused and steady, we can also se that SHELLEY has some extremely strange deformations. On his neck, there is a split, or opening. Effectively a large tracheotomy, shaped as a sideways mouth, running fr the concave skin above his collar bone to under his chin. Inside the mouth, where there might be a tongue, there is something fat and white and red. It looks like a skinned SNAKE. Air bubbles through the blood around it, and the SNAKE is writhing slowly. There are more deformations on SHELLEY'S arms. Each one i split, just below the elbow, into two. Each split has secondary protrusions, finger-like, at irregular intervals. PEYTON looks haunted. Jaw locked into a rictus.
96) 1) dialog: Oh God, Shelley... KANE cuts PEYTON off - - by lifting his gun and firing a quick burst into SHELLE In SHELLEY'S throat, the skinned SNAKE judders and contor Then stops moving. 108. KANE pulls at PEYTON’S shoulder.

98) 3) dialog: Killing it.
98) 5) dialog: Where the fuck you think it came from? He fires off another full clip.

98) 8) dialog: Have you two taken a look in the mirror recently? Or even a look at each other? Cause you really fucking should. PEYTON flips to his rifle’s underslung GRENADE LAUNCHER.
98) 9) dialog: Eat it, you son of a bitch! A hollow thump - as the grenade is fired. Then an explosion high in the air, like a firework, momentarily lighting up the sand and water. Then a moment of quiet. Waves lapping on the shore.

He’s on all fours, head dipped, with his spine buckling a he’s retching. KANE isn’t helping. He just holds his rifle. Watching. Then PEYTON lifts his head - - revealing there is something wrong with the shape of hi skull. At this distance, it’s hard to tell what. Some kin of deformation that has elongated his face. Some words are exchanged between them. A beat. Then KANE shoots PEYTON. cuT TO -
