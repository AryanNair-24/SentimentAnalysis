LENA in white. The couple embracing. Another shows the couple in Verona. Perhaps the honeymoon

LENA runs a primed roller over the wall. Leaving a fat wh stripe over the old colour. Flecking her shirt and face w paint. Smearing it off her forehead with the back of her hand. Repainting the room is an act of moving on. She is energised. Focused. So focused - - that she doesn’t see the figure that appears in the doo of the bedroom. KANE. He seems different to the photos. In uniform, but bloodle in his complexion. Older in his gaze. He watches LENA painting. Oddly blank. Not announcing his presence - - until she turns, needing to reload the roller - - and sees him. First, she jolts at the sight of the figure. Second, she recognises him.

The blood of her husband is now dried black, stiffened on the material of her short and trousers, rusted and flaking on her hands. She is trembling. Beats pass. Then the door UNLOCKS, startling LENA.

16) 29) dialog: You know what? I think I just figured you out. You're CIA. And Kane was on some kind of operation for you. And you believe he told me something before he got sick.

At the door of the shower room, an armed SPEC-OPS SOLDIER stands guard. His back is to the room, to protect LENA’S modesty.

25) 4) dialog: Come on, please. No, no, no... A terrible sense that she has managed to escape from a sm locked room into an even smaller one. Then SUDDENLY - - the elevator starts moving. On the digital panel, the numbers start moving upwards. Past the lobby - to level 1. Where it stops. The doors OPEN, revealing a man in a white lab coat. A SCIENTIST of some sort. His head is dropped, reading thro a sheaf of forms, which he is filling out. 24. LENA stands, back straight against the wall, terrified to meet his gaze. But he hardly seems to notice her. Just touches the biometric pad, and presses the button for Level 2. The doors close. The elevator starts moving again. Then, still without raising his head, the SCIENTIST speak
25) 6) dialog: ++. Tell me about it.
26) 1) text: LENA has entered into the MESS HALL of the facility. It is packed with SOLDIERS, SCIENTISTS, and ADMINISTRATIV STAFF. They sit at tables, chatting. Carry trays with food, and drinks. On the far side of the room, there is a floor to ceiling glass wall, through which for the first time in the facil we see DAYLIGHT. Bright, burnished, gold. In the middle of the wall is an open double door, leading the outside. 25. She realises at once: she has to make it across the room that door. To the exterior, the sunlight. It’s the only exit, apart from the elevator from which she has just com But among the uniforms and lab coats and suits, there is one person wearing an orange jumpsuit. LENA. She takes a breath. And simply starts walking. Not hurried, not slow. Not drawing attention to herself. And for a moment, it seems as if it might work. The peopl around simply don’t notice her. Then - - someone looks at her. A WOMAN, sat at a table. She frowns. Taps the arm of the person beside her. LENA starts walking quicker.
27) 1) text: LENA makes only five or six steps into the sunlight. Then - - slows. And stops. Arrested by the view in front of her. REVEAL that LENA is standing on a VIEWING PLATFORM. Essentially a massive balcony, which projects from the ME HALL, three stories above the ground. And the facility from which she has escaped turns out to kind of gatehouse structure - like a medieval castle, dra into a brutalist Twenty First Century. Either side of the facility, a concrete wall extends. Massive, buttressed, punctuated with watch towers. It loo designed to contain or defend against something mythic in scale. This would be a stunning sight in its own right - but it’ the view from the platform that stopped LENA in her track It shows a landscape, behind which the sun sets. A stretch of bare ground, for a few hundred yards beyond concrete wall, leading to a dense forest. And in front of - or permeating - the forest, there is a shimmer. Similar to a heat haze - it gives a glassy liquid quality everything seen through its prism. But unlike a heat haze - and like a prism - it splits lig So, through the shimmer - - the sun distorts into a deliquescing orange orb, fringe with chromatic aberrations of blue and green. - the colours on the clouds split into a full rainbow spectrum, spread across the sky like psychedelic Northern Lights. - the trees in the forest distort gently, as if pushed by gentle wind that eases the trunks into movement, as if th were as light as leaves.

In the middle of the room is a large digital map. It show the coast of Northern Florida, the boundary wall of the Southern reach facility, and - in illuminated blue - the border of the Shimmer. On the adjacent wall there is a collection of images. Some show a tall white LIGHTHOUSE - with archive architectural plans of the building. The rest are a seque of TEAM PHOTOS. Small groups of men and women with backpa and hiking gear. Some with weapons and uniforms. LENA walks to the digital map table. DR VENTRESS, standing by the window, starts to talk.

DR VENTRESS (CONT’D) If you were to join us, I don’t think it would be wise to explain your connection to the previous mission. It might not be... helpful. To the group dynamic.

RADEK is in her mid-twenties, but feels younger. She has sheltered quality that people have when they’ve passed straight from school to college to doctorate. 34. She's having trouble with her weapon. She looks frightene by the recoil, leaning her face away from the stock, and convulsively screwing her eyes as the gun starts firing. cur TO - - a near random spray of rounds that hit in various place but not the target. cur TO - - LENA. Stepping up to the fourth alley in the firing range. Lifting a rifle. Squeezing the trigger. She keeps the gun steady, fires in neat three round burst and the stock pushed tight up against her cheek bone. cuT TO - - a neat grouping of rounds, appearing in the middle of t target. cur TO - - DR VENTRESS. Observing. She shifts her gaze to THORENSEN, SHEPPARD, and RADEK - - who are clearly surprised to find this new person in th fourth firing alley. LENA empties the last rounds in her clip. The final volley of gunshots leave a ringing echo in the concrete chamber. Broken by DR VENTRESS.

As they pass it, LENA pauses. Sees the skull. The way patches of hair and dried skin st cling to the underside of the skull, where it has been shielded from the wind and sun. Sees the missing section of bone above the left eye socke blown out by a bullet. Sees the curve of ribs, visible where the material of the uniform has started to disintegrate.

39) 11) dialog: It means the cell doesn’t grow old and die. It becomes immortal.
39) 13) dialog: We see the process of growing old as somehow natural. Whereas in fact, it’s fault in our genes. We inherited it, but we don’t need it, or want it. (MORE )

41) 1) text: LENA unzips the front flap of her tent and climbs out - - to discover a campsite. Five small tents, circled aroun burned out fire. The campsite is positioned in a grassy clearing, deep ins a forest. The surrounding trees are Oak and Cyprus. Looking up, the sun and clouds are seen through the famil mirage-like distortion - as if the Shimmer is like a dome structure, which we are now inside. Just in front of LENA, THORENSEN and SHEPPARD sit surroun by packets of food. A little distance away, RADEK is looking at a piece of electronic equipment. DR VENTRESS is nowhere to be seen.

43) 5) dialog: ... These are extremely strange flowers.
43) 7) dialog: To look at them you wouldn’t say they’re the same species. LENA pulls back an area of flowers to show the plant syst beneath.
43) 8) dialog: But they’re all growing from the same branch structure. So not just the same species. The same plant. 50.
43) 10) dialog: It seems stuck in a continuous mutation. Some kind of morphogenesis error.
43) 12) dialog: It’s very pretty, but you’d sure as Hell call it a pathology if you saw it in a human. LENA picks a white and crimson petal, and holds it.
43) 14) dialog: So what do you see in there? RADEK has found something else.
43) 18) dialog: Radek! RADEK reacts - - and sees the gaping MOUTH and TEETH as they lunge towar her. She turns away - - just as the creature’s jaws SNAP. Closing on her BACKPACK. RADEK’S screams are abruptly knocked out of her - - as the ALLIGATOR viciously snaps its head to the side, tossing the young woman like a ragdoll. RADEK remains held fast by the shoulder straps on her bag Then - - the ALLIGATOR pulls back into the water, and both the creature and RADEK are gone. A moment of stunned silence. Then LENA is running for the water.

Vaguely puzzled about where she picked it up.

Nature has been busy reclaiming the area. Tall grasses pu through cracks in the tarmac. The concrete is stained wit rain and dark algae. And as with the trees in the swamp, brightly-coloured mos bloom on the buildings. DR VENTRESS notices LENA’S gaze going to them.

REVEAL what was once the REC ROOM of the abandoned base. There’s a dart board on the wall, and a pool table with m covered baize, and a pinball machine with broken glass. She's got a sheen of sweat on her face. Wipes it off. Looks around. On the floor, she sees THORENSEN, asleep on her unrolled bedding. Beside THORENSEN is RADEK, also asleep. Beside RADEK is SHEPPARD. Awake. SHEPPARD winks.

61) 9) dialog: I’1l go check on Dr Ventress.
62) 1) text: LENA exits the REC ROOM hut. The hut is on the edge of the abandoned facility. The starlight doesn’t illuminate much, but we can just about out the chain-link perimeter fence, and beyond it, the bl shape of the forest. DR VENTRESS is sitting at a picnic table, just outside th door, studying a map by torchlight.

62) 15) dialog: What do you mean?
62) 18) dialog: ... What was that?
62) 20) dialog: No, just - 74. LENA breaks off.
62) 21) dialog: Yes. Through the scope, there is something. A large hole in the perimeter fence. The chain-link twisted, pulled open. cur TO - - SHEPPARD emerges from the REC ROOM HUT, into the moonli holding her weapon and a flashlight.
62) 23) dialog: Something’s just come through the fence.
62) 25) dialog: It’s ripped open like a zipper.
62) 27) dialog: I don’t know. Something big. ANOTHER NOISE. And this is organic. It’s a thump of movement. Then a panting breath. A snort. And it feels very close. The three women freeze. A beat. Then SHEPPARD lifts her FLASHLIGHT. Points it straight in front of her. And illuminates a huge creature... ... less than two metres away. 75. It looks something like a BLACK BEAR. But like the GATOR, it’s twice the size it should be. And it's stranger than the GATOR. It seems to be enmeshed with plant matter. Stems and leaves are growing out of it fur. Its fur hangs like the Spanish moss on the swamp oak branches. Long thorns push outwards, bristling over the crown of its skull, along its snout, down its arms. And it’s up on its hind legs. Standing like a man, toweri over SHEPPARD and LENA. Blotting out the stars. Then it opens its jaws. And it looks as if some of the pl matter is actually growing from inside the BEAR’S mouth. It is a terrifying and transfixing sight.
62) 29) dialog: Sheppard! No answer. LENA clamps the night scope to her eye, scanning desperat SEES something massive in the darkness, moving fast, back towards the fence. A glimpse of SHEPPARD, dragged like a doll. Then it’s gone. The creature, and SHEPPARD, have vanished

64) 15) dialog: Okay. Then I agree with you. We should be heading back. THORENSEN looks relieved.
64) 17) dialog: (interrupts) Just a minute. Beat. THORENSEN already doesn’t like this.
64) 18) dialog: We head back: yes. But I don’t think we do it by retracing the route we took here. It took us approximately four days to reach this point, right? But the coast is only two days away. And as Sheppard pointed out: once we hit the shore, we can follow it until we hit the perimeter wall. It’s impossible to get lost, and it will be easier terrain than making our way back through the swamps.
64) 20) dialog: «+. If you like, yes. 79.
64) 22) dialog: It has nothing to do with the lighthouse. I believe the coast is the best route out. That’s all. Silence. THORENSEN glances at RADEK. The younger woman has closed her eyes. Just trying to blo it all out.

66) 0) text: The four-person team walk in single file. DR VENTRESS on point. Then RADEK. Then THORENSEN. Then LENA. As they walk, LENA becomes aware that THORENSEN is talkin herself. Low muttering. Unintelligible. It sounds like some kind o internal private argument, unwittingly externalised. LENA watches.
66) 1) dialog: Hey Thorensen. THORENSEN’S gaze flicks round. There's a flash of something in her eyes. Something like anger. Something like a lack of recognitio As if whatever she’s seeing at that moment, it isn’t LENA Then it’s gone. 81.

But it’s not the BEAR. It’s a DEER. Or a deer-like creature. Elongated legs. Branch and leaf structures its back.

In the middle of the clearing, sunlit, is SHEPPARD. Lying her back, facing upwards. Clothes soaked with blood. LENA watches. Waits. No sound, except wind in trees.
69) 0) text: LENA cautiously approaches SHEPPARD'S body, gun raised, continually scanning the tree line. As she reach her colleague - - REVEAL SHEPPARD. Her midriff is torn. Either bitten or clawed. Through the dark congealed blood and ripped material, we glimpse the white coil of intestine. But her face is intact. There are flecks of blood on her cheek. And her eyes are open. Then - - something very strange happens. Her LEFT EYE - and her left eye only - makes a sudden jittering movement. Like a quiver. LENA jumps.
69) 1) dialog: Jesus! Then SHEPPARD’S slightly parted lips move. As if just starting to form a word.
69) 2) dialog: ... Sheppard? CUT BACK to SHEPPARD'S face - - as SHEPPARD'S mouth is pushed more fully open, which reveals that INSIDE her mouth, there is a creature. The size of small snake. The texture and colour of worm. SHEPPARD'S cheeks undulate gently with the movement. 84. And the LEFT EYE suddenly starts to sink into the socket, if being consumed. cuT TO -

LENA is distracted by the sight of one of the houses - fr which a tree has appeared to grow from the inside. Branch push out through the windows and roof shingles.
74) 2) dialog: Hello? The silhouette of the MAN doesn’t react at all. LENA takes another step -— - and the shift in perspective reveals another figure. This one is behind the man, behind the building. Not in shadow, but caught in the light from the dropping sun. It looks like a CHILD. 86. Also motionless, also misshapen. But now, in the light, the oddness of the shape makes mor sense. The CHILD is not flesh and blood, but plant. A twisting r system form calves and feet, leading up to knotted branch and densely packed leaves. Like a topiary.
75) 0) text: LENA, followed by the others, walks through the space bet the buildings, past the shape of the MAN - - into something that is like a statue garden. In the space between the back of the houses and the tree- of the forest, there are twenty or so plant figures. Some of them have grown into reasonable facsimiles of a m or woman, or a child. Others are incomplete. The legs, and half the torso. An outstretched arm, becoming a tangle of twigs and leaves beyond the bicep. Others have exploded far beyond the basic outline of a hu expanding out into tree structures.
75) 4) dialog: They haven't been cut this way. LENA plucks a LEAF from the CHILD FIGURE.
75) 5) dialog: They've grown this way.
75) 16) dialog: They're the genes that define body structure. But in animals. Not plants. 88.
75) 18) dialog: No - they’re just simulacra. Like a stick insect or chameleon. What you're saying is simply not possible.
75) 21) dialog: You know what she means, Thorensen. She means our DNA. LENA lets the leaf drop.
75) 22) dialog: Whatever's happening to everything else will also be happening to us. In the low sun, everything upright is silhouette, fringed with gold. On the ground, the long shadows of the women and the plan statues are fringed with chromatic aberration, and are indistinguishable from each other.

76) 1) dialog: You all get some sleep. I’m keeping first watch.
78) 1) text: LENA sits at the dining table. The room is lit by her upended flashlight. She’s removed the top, exposing the bulb, like a candle. She's watching the other three. Laid out on their bedding. Their soft breathing. Satisfying herself that they’re all asleep. Then she quietly opens her backpack. Removes a small case. Inside is the equipment we saw her select from the Southern Reach laboratory. A field microscope. A scalpel. She removes a blade from a sealed foil packet. Clips a blade into the scalpel. Then she rolls up her left shirt sleeve. It reveals her forearm - - and the unexplained BRUISE she first noticed while talk to SHEPPARD as they paddled through the swamp. The mark is now darker. And larger. Roughly circular, wit a slight indication of a pattern. It’s as the bruise were painted with ink on wet paper, and the marks have blurred into something too abstract to understand. LENA gazes at the strange, oddly malign shape. Then pushes the scalpel into it. Drawing blood from the d marks. A beat. 90. The sight of the crimson bead has hypnotised her. cuT TO -

Then she stands, walks past the apparently sleeping figur of RADEK, THORENSEN and DR VENTRESS.
80) 1) text: LENA enters the KITCHEN. Goes directly to the sink. And - quietly, with a minimum of fuss - throws up. When she has finished, she turns around -— - and sees RADEK. Standing at the kitchen door. Looking a her.

84) 22) dialog: No, Dan. It’s you too. LENA turns away, back to the window. CLOSE ON LENA’S FACE.

Wrists bound behin their backs. Ankles tied to the chair legs. Blood has run down LENA’S face from a cut inside her hair line. DR VENTRESS is bruised under the eye. THORENSEN stands in front of them, holding her gun.

86) 38) dialog: (yells) Radek! Untie me NOW! RADEK finally reacts. Moves to LENA, pulling her KNIFE - - but too late. THORENSEN has pulled the dresser back, and pulled the doo open. It reveals the huge plant-enmeshed BEAR-CREATURE that kil her. Lit now in the light from the room. - is the huge shape of the plant-enmeshed BLACK BEAR. 100. Eyes reflecting light from the room as bright yellow disc Long thorns cresting over its head and shoulders. Oddly elongated claws, like a long hooks of a sloth.

88) 1) text: RADEK sits on the porch of the house, slumped on a rottin wicker chair. Her chest is bandaged - but the bandage is soaked through with blood. Her skin looks like white wax. Her eyes open. She sees LENA sitting beside her. LENA holds a water bottle to RADEK’S lips.
88) 4) dialog: Gone, about half an hour ago. The coast isn’t far, so I’m sure she’1ll make it. The only real purpose of this expedition was to give her a chance to reach the lighthouse. Find out what’s inside, after all these years. 102. LENA pauses.
88) 5) dialog: I don’t much like her. But I’m glad she’1ll get what she wanted. A beat. Then RADEK glances at LENA.

A few beats later, LENA appears. Face drained of colour and emotion. She stares at the foliate people. cur TO - - the statue garden. LENA has set all the figures on fire. She's watching them burn. And she’s howling with rage and grief. For RADEK, SHEPPAR THORENSEN, and KANE. Setting fire to the forest feels like revenge. From orange flames, wrapped around human forms - - cUT TO BLACK. 104.

Visually similar to the tumour-like growths on the plants buildings... ... but these are made of sand. Like massive termite moun as much as thirty foot high, morphed into spires and oddl organic abstractions. Only one other landmark can be seen. A couple of miles distant, seen through a blue haze of ai and sea spray. The LIGHTHOUSE. Slender, tall. And white - where one can still see of the original construction, behind the brightly coloured moss. Leading that direction, a snaking line of footprints are clearly visible in the damp sand. The trail left by DR VENTRESS. cur TO - LENA. Standing on the pale sands. Wind pulls at her hair. She looks down at her arm... ..+. where the BRUISE has now resolved into something immediately recognisable. The dark circle and blurred indication of patterns have become a TATTOO. 105. Exactly the same distinctive image that THORENSEN wore. The ouroboros. She touches it with her thumb, as half-expecting it might wipe away. And when she pulls her thumb away - - something moves in her flesh. Not just a flex. Much more fundamental. A bone, shifting and contracting. Or a muscle, worming its way to a new position. LENA closes her eyes.
92) 0) text: LENA stands on the beach. The LIGHTHOUSE is still a few hundred metres away. The area here is littered with bones and scraps of clothi The scene of a massacre, many years ago. Blown and blasted by the wind, sand, sun, and salt. The bones look like ivory. A bright red backpack has been bleached pink. The body beneath it has almost been completely submerged into the dune. LENA reaches down and picks up the top half of a skull. The back of the skull morphs into the star-shape of a vertebrae, as it had been fused with its own backbone. LENA drops it back on the sand. Then continues towards the tall white lighthouse building 106.
93) 0) text: From the top of the lighthouse, we watch LENA approach. Below, at its base, its door hangs open, swinging in the breeze, knocking gently against its frame.
94) 0) text: LENA enters the base of the lighthouse. Light filters down from the window, thirty metres above. It illuminates a round room, with some specific features. A wooden staircase winds up the circular wall to the top the structure. Abandoned on the floor, there is some MILITARY GEAR. A BACKPACK, surrounded by cannister-shaped GRENADES, and a RIFLE. Opposite where LENA enters, there is a TUNNEL in the floo about two metres in diameter. At its entrance, the wooden boards have been pulled up, and laid out as a kind of ram structure, leading downwards. INSIDE the tunnel something glows. The soft blue-green li of phosphorescence. Finally, in the middle of the room there is a VIDEO CAMER a tripod. The camera faces a long black scorch mark, risi up the curved wall, from a blackened heap on the ground. nature of the heap is unclear. It’s charred and fused bey all recognition. LENA takes this all in. Her gaze finally settling on the CAMERA. cuT TO -
105) 2) dialog: (whispers ) No. Her eyes flick to the blackened heap under the scorch mar Now able to make sense of the shape.
105) 3) dialog: No, no, no... She is interrupted by a sound. A distorted scream. Echoed and distant, as if having pass through passages and chambers. Female. DR VENTRESS. It’s coming from the torn up floorboards. The TUNNEL, tha leads down into bedrock. LENA looks to where the floorboards have been pulled up. To the tunnel entrance, and the soft blue-green light. LENA controls her fear. Knuckles white around the grip of her rifle.
106) 1) text: LENA makes her way down the tunnel, gun raised. 114. The walls continue the curve of the lighthouse above, and floor is sloping downwards - - which means the passage is corkscrewing into the ground It is unclear how the rock has been cleared. The walls, ceiling, and floor are made of smooth black rock, like obsidian. The rock is rippled, as if worn smooth by an ancient stre or lava flow. It is seamed with PHOSPHORESCENCE - illuminating everythi in the way that sea creatures light their way in the dept And the walls seem to be moving. Or gently undulating. The surface of the walls are covered in CILIA. Tiny anemo arms waving, caught in the flow of slow-moving water. The flow movement is down. Deeper into the tunnel. As if what lies inside is feeding on what lies outside, and bei channeled along a vein and capillary structure.
107) 1) text: As if from LENA’S POV - - we continue. And as we circle downwards, the ripples on the smooth bla rock walls become more pronounced. Then stop being random undulations... «++. and become FORMS. Organic. Embedded into the rock like fossils. First, there are fractal PLANT shapes. Leaf, branch, fern Then, in the flora, there are ANIMALS. The patterned armo of an alligator, or its teeth, of the fat swirl of tail. snout and claw of a bear. The curls of snakes. The feathe imprints of birds wings. And then - we start to see HUMANS. A torso. An arm. A face, trying to push out from between the other forms. Or finger tips, stretched out, as if try to grab or be grabbed. The tunnel has become a tableau. A boiling sea of people creatures - melded and frozen in black marble. 115. Animal into plant. Plant into human. Human into animal. And then - — movement. Treacle slow, but unambiguous. No longer frozen. No longe fossils. The walls are alive. Or the things inside them are not dead. And at the moment of that realisation - - the tunnel suddenly stops, and opens out into a CHAMBER
108) 1) text: The chamber is roughly semi-spherical. Three quarters of sphere, with the bottom levelled out into a floor. The sculpted forms of humans and animals continue across floor, but as they rise up the walls they taper into curv points. Either side of these points, the walls are glassy smooth. The arrangement is similar to petals, as if we are on the inside of flower before it has unfurled. The interior of vast lotus bulb. The very center of the chamber is particularly bright - because it is to here that the phosphorescent veins and channels all lead. And standing on this brightest point - - is DR VENTRESS. The doctor is internally lit. Cilia cover her skin like undulating fur. She shimmers gently. LENA hesitates in the entrance. She looks around. Up at the petal structure. Down at the energy feed beneath DR VENTRESS. Then back to the glowing figure of the doctor. LENA takes a step inside the chamber.
108) 2) dialog: «+. Doctor Ventress? 116. DR VENTRESS turns to LENA. She has the same expression as KANE when he appeared back home. Alzheimer’s-like. In her eyes there is confusion. But through the confusion, a vibrating sense of fear.
108) 3) dialog: Dr Ventress - what’s happened to you? DR VENTRESS hesitates. As if half-remembering.
108) 5) dialog: «+. It’s inside you?
108) 7) dialog: What is inside you?
108) 9) dialog: «+. Something alien?
108) 11) dialog: No - Through this - - she lifts her gun. Like a dream - - which shatters, the moment she squeezes the trigger and FIRES. BULLETS slam into the BEING. The rounds have an amazing effect. Where they hit the body, a hole expands, like a bullet in ballistic gelatine - but does not contract. Where they penetrate the body, they leave bright trails o emerald light, like sunlight through dust motes. For a moment, the BEING is poised in this state. Hugely misshapen. Speared with brilliant green. Then it EXPANDS. TRANSFORMS. And RESOLVES - - into a HUMANOID FIGURE. Sexless. Featureless. Having the arms, legs, of a human - man or woman. But nothing else. No eyes, or mouth, or nose, or muscle form. LENA is transfixed by the sight. The FIGURE turns to LENA. And we see its smooth facial area. Internally covering the skin like undulating fur, shimmeri: A beat, between the woman and the humanoid. LENA’'S weapon is out. She has no more clips. She starts to run. The HUMANOID observes her run. Then it starts to follow her. The first step is slow. The second faster. The third is as fluid and powerful as LENA. It starts sprinting.
109) 1) text: LENA sprints back up the tunnel. Stumbling over the shifting melded animal/human Crashing to the ground. Scrambling back up. cur TO - - the HUMANOID. In pursuit. 119. head and torso lit. Cilia ng gently. shapes. 120. And we see something strange happen. Where LENA fell and tripped - - the HUMANOID does exactly the same thing. Falling in the same place. In the same way. A simulacrum LENA’S action. cur TO - - LENA, reaching the TUNNEL exit. Climbing back up into the base of the lighthouse.
110) 0) text: LENA scrambles across the room - - towards the door to the LIGHTHOUSE. But she doesn’t make it. The HUMANOID simply appears in front of her, before she reaches the door. It is unclear how it got there. A frozen beat. Then LENA STRIKES the HUMANOID with all her strength. And moment later, in a mirror of her actions - - the HUMANOID STRIKES HER BACK - but with incredible pow LENA is sent flying backwards across the room. She collides with the CAMERA and TRIPOD. All skid across the room to the wall. But it has provided LENA with a weapon. As the HUMANOID reapproaches her, she picks up the TRIPOD and swings it l a club, smashing the camera against the HUMANOID’S head. And again, the HUMANOID mirrors the actions. Using its ar like a club. For a second time, LENA is sent hurtling back across the by the force of the impact. But this time towards KANE’S BACKPACK. She collides with it, and the PHOSPHOROUS GRENADES beside 121. And as she gets to her feet, the HUMANOID is again on her Standing directly in front of her. Featureless, eyeless, somehow watching. Utterly, infinitely more powerful than she is. For the first time, we see something beaten in LENA. Something broken.
110) 1) dialog: Please - She expects a killing blow. And flinches - - and the HUMANOID does the same. LENA sees. She immediately realises what we already know. The HUMANO is mimicking her. She is fighting herself. We can see her thinking: can this be true. The killing blow still hasn’t come. LENA lifts a hand. Fingers trembling with adrenaline and fear. And the HUMANOID’S opposite hand also rises. She pauses. The HUMANOID’S hand pauses. LENA’S hand starts moving again. Until - - she touches its cheek. An exact mirror of the gesture where she touched KANE'S f at the start of the film, when he appeared at their bedro at home. A beat. Then the HUMANOID raises its hand. LENA holds motionless, suspended, except for tight breath and trickling beads of sweat, as the softly glowing hand lifts to her face... --. Then - - lightly touches her cheek also. 122. And as it does so - - the HUMANOID starts another FOLDING TRANSFORMATION. Rippling, folding, collapsing. And this time, resolving itself as KANE. LENA gasps. For a moment, the two face each other. Then LENA opens her mouth to speak.
110) 2) dialog: ... Kane? Beat.
110) 4) dialog: (whispers ) I’m sorry. Then LENA pulls the pin. KANE mirrors. Soft ticking from the cannisters. 123. Seconds passing.
110) 5) dialog: (breathes ) Five, four, three, two — Then - LENA drops the grenade - - and throws herself sideways. KANE’S head turns, sees - - but he’s too late to fully react. LENA’S PHOSPHOROUS GRENADE DETONATES. And a moment later, so does KANE'S. The interior of the lighthouse is suddenly illuminated by stark white light. The route to the exit is blocked by the blaze. LENA scrambles for the STAIRS that spiral up to the top o the LIGHTHOUSE. Climbs upwards. Beneath her is LIGHT and SMOKE. In the brightness, we can glimpse the SHADOW SHAPE of the HUMANOID/KANE - shape-shifting in silhouette.
111) 0) text: LENA has reaches the top - a semi-circular balcony around old housing for the lamp. Below her is a fifty foot drop to the burning interior of lighthouse. The whole wooden structure of the building is starting to burn. She kicks out a window. The jump to the ground looks lethal. The lighthouse is ringed with a concrete platform. The only hope might be t sloping sand dunes, just beyond the ring of concrete, whi could take the deadly impact out of the fall. But the fire behind doesn’t give her a choice. Within a minute, her options will only be to jump or burn. 124. LENA takes a step back, to give herself the chance to run the window, and propel herself through with enough force reach the dunes. But as the steps back, she JOLTS. And TURNS. The HUMANOID is directly behind her. It’s burned. Horribly damaged. Locked into jittering transformations, none of which can quite resolve. Shadows of humans and creatures and alien forms flicker across it. All in expressions of agony. It is a TRULY NIGHTMARISH SIGHT. Reflexively, LENA screams. In its broken mirror state, the HUMANOID also screams. A maw appearing where a mouth might be. Then, as if with a final effort, it makes a FINAL TRANSFORMATION — - and resolves into LENA. A literal mirror image. Down to the finest detail. Their stances mirror each other. They are dressed identically. They are smeared with blood identically. And we have literally no way of telling who is who. A frozen beat. Then one LENA lunges at the other. Strikes. Impacts. And one LENA topples backwards, over the edge of the balc - falling down into the phosphorous blaze. The other watches. TIGHT ON HER FACE. As she watches herself fall. Blank. 125. Held. Face illuminated by the bleaching light. There is no clear indication as to which LENA lived, and which LENA died.
112) 0) text: WIDE on the burning LIGHTHOUSE. Long flames curl from the top window, into a plume of dar smoke. The sun is setting, and is clustered with the psychedelic colour refractions we always see through the Shimmer. Except that something is clearly happening. The movements and vibrations of the Shimmer are settling. And the colours are becoming less intense. Then all along the beach, the SAND STRUCTURES start collapsing. First one, then three, then seven. Then all together. Wind collects them as they fall. And as they fall, they REVEAL a figure walking across the sand towards us. LENA. cuT TO -
114) 0) text: - a STAR-FIELD in a night sky. Dense constellations. The Milky Way. Drift down. Past the MOON. To the SOUTHERN REACH FACILITY. And a lone woman walking out of the tree line, across the scrubland towards it. LENA.
114) 1) dialog: I want to see my husband. cuT TO -
115) 1) text: - a medical ward. LENA is walking down it, with a DOCTOR alongside, and two SPEC OPS SOLDIERS following.
115) 4) dialog: I'd like to see him alone.
116) 1) text: LENA enters. Closes the door behind her. 127. KANE looks round, and they lock eyes. Neither speak. After a moment, LENA goes to the WINDOW. Looks out at the NIGHT SKY.
116) 2) dialog: Are you Kane? Silence. Then KANE gives a slight shake of the head.
