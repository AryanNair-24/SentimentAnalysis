Coming up the hill, we begin to make out a hunting party. The sound first.  Like a small army, crashing their way u the winding path.  GHILLIES urging on their horses and dogs, guns and equipment jangling off pony-hacks an then the tall figure of JOHN BROWN striding out in front. Making no concession to anyone, he force-marches them up the hill, eyes on the hunt ahead. Behind them trot the me on horseback -- DISRAELI, PONSONBY, BERTIE and other GENTLEMEN, each led by GHILLIES and ATTENDANTS, among the ARCHIE. Suddenly, BROWN stops and raises a hand.  The party halts He listens for a second.  Satisfied that he has found his quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentleme dismount as quietly as they can.

Suddenly the huge castle doors open and VICTORIA bustles out with her entourage in tow.  BROWN -- only just in tim - yanks open the door for VICTORIA to step past him and take her place.  She ignores him completely. BROWN slams the doors.  As he looks up, he sees his broth ARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard.  For a second the two brothers hold each other's gaze.  It's obvious that ARCHIE has noticed the Queen's indifference. BROWN turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races away under him.
