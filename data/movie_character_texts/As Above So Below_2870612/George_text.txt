7) 1) dialog: This is what I love about Paris. You can literally step up to any corner and there are layers and layers of history going back thousands of years. Someone, name an era. A couple hands go up. George points at one.
7) 3) dialog: Oh, there’s a good one for that. Look at this street right here. In 1795 royalist sympathizers stormed the streets threatening the deputies of the National Convention. Benji walks the camera closer as George talks.
7) 4) dialog: Napoleon Bonaparte, recently made Commander of the Army of the Interior, was asked to stop them. So what does he do? He fires cannons into the crowd! Cannons loaded with pellets so they would literally decimate hundreds of people. So what do you think the government did when they found out? You think they reprimanded him? Put him in jail? Anything? No! They promoted him! You do not want to piss off the French. He looks around at the crowd. 14.
7) 5) dialog: Okay, who wants to pick another era?
7) 7) dialog: (to the class) Give me a moment, please. George walks to Scarlett.
7) 8) dialog: Whatever it is, I want no part of it.
7) 10) dialog: I'll save you the time. No. George looks to the camera guy.
7) 11) dialog: Who's this guy? (looks to Benji) Who are you?
7) 14) dialog: (to Benji) Word to the wise... walk, don’t run from this one!
7) 16) dialog: Yeah. Shut up. (to Benji) Did she tell you last time I saw her, I literally wound up in a Turkish prison?! 15.
7) 18) dialog: It was jail. In Turkey. Think she was there waiting for me when I got out?
7) 20) dialog: God forbid. Well go on, chase your lead. See how far that gets you. I have a class to teach. He turns to walk away.
7) 22) dialog: You did?
7) 24) dialog: It was in Iran wasn’t it. (catches himself) Forget I asked, I don’t care. (stops) It was though, wasn’t it.
7) 26) dialog: I knew it! Ha! I knew it!
7) 28) dialog: Wait. Did you go to Iran?! 16.
7) 30) dialog: You did, didn’t you. By yourself?
7) 32) dialog: You are such a lunatic. (to the camera) She is a total lunatic. Be careful. (to Scarlett) I‘1ll help translate. But that’s it!
7) 34) dialog: (before going) I knew it would be in Iran. INT. GEORGE’S ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORKSHOP - EVENING George and Scarlett look over a small model replica of th statue she found in Iran and a large photo printing of Flamel’s tombstone. Scarlett waits anxiously as George analyzes the symbols writes as he goes. The room is full of artifacts, mud, microscopes. All bone and clay and dirt. All function, no form. Completely lack a woman’s touch.
7) 36) dialog: Shh. She paces. She’s been waiting for this moment all her lif George puts his pen down.
7) 37) dialog: Okay.
7) 41) dialog: Okay, let me read. I think it’s in couplets, so let me try to get the rhythm right.
7) 43) dialog: Let me do this right... (reads ) “Winged vulture leads your way, with brightest light, in darkest day. Scarlett sits, not sure what this means.
7) 44) dialog: Underneath the heaven's reign, what is lost shall be regained, when halfway twixt the darkest gate and this tablet laid atop this pair'ed fate.
7) 46) dialog: Pair’ed.
7) 48) dialog: Yes. But paired doesn’t rhyme.
7) 50) dialog: It rhymed in Aramaic. I’m trying to do justice to the translation. 17. 18.
7) 52) dialog: Of course I’m sure.
7) 54) dialog: Where it was, in a cemetery that no longer exists.
7) 56) dialog: “What is lost shall be regained.”
7) 58) dialog: Maybe.
7) 60) dialog: Or under this tombstone! It’s got a night sky right on it.
7) 62) dialog: “darkest gate...”
7) 64) dialog: Okay. But that gives us nothing. Halfway between his grave and the gates of hell? 19.
7) 66) dialog: What’s that?
7) 68) dialog: It has the distances they believed between heaven and earth and hell!
7) 70) dialog: So halfway twixt this tablet and...
7) 72) dialog: Feet were a bit shorter back then. More like 10.8 inches per foot. Won’t be hard to...
7) 74) dialog: Scarlett, you're in Paris! She gets his meaning. 20.
7) 77) dialog: It’s a network of tunnels under the streets of Paris, that spans over 200 miles...? No, nothing? He sees Benji really doesn’t know anything about it, so h goes on.
7) 78) dialog: In the 1700s, the Cemetaire des Innocents...
7) 80) dialog: Was so full of hundreds of years of dead bodies, that the entire city stank, and people were getting sick. It was disgusting. So... they took all the lime quarries under the city and used them to house the remains of some 6 million bodies. He lets that sink in.
7) 82) dialog: It’s by far the world’s largest crypt.
7) 84) dialog: And get your Philosopher's Stone. Which, for the record, I don’t really actually believe in.
8) 0) text: Scarlett, George and Benji stand on a street corner near where the Flamels were allegedly buried. Scarlett refers her father’s notebook.
8) 2) dialog: Let’s walk it out. She paces her steps, counting as she goes. She waves to traffic as she walks right through the busy Paris intersection. George shakes his head, looks to Benji. She stops. Calls back to them.
9) 2) dialog: Shit.
9) 5) dialog: The catacombs don’t go under Flamel’s grave. Scarlett takes a step back. Thinking.
9) 7) dialog: We? There’s no we here. I’m helping with translation. That’s it. Scarlett chooses to ignore him.
9) 9) dialog: Burrow in? You know how thick these walls are? They’re made of solid granite, and they’ve all been reinforced since.... Something occurs to George.
9) 10) dialog: «+. parts of the city collapsed into it! George looks like he’s just been struck by lightning. He feverishly grabs a small handful of pins, races to the map.
9) 11) dialog: In 1774, about 100 feet of Avenue Denfert-Rochereau... He places a pin in the map.
9) 12) dialog: Was literally swallowed up into the ground, falling 100 feet into the earth. He places another pin. 23.
9) 13) dialog: Another collapse happened a few years later at Barriére d'Enfer. Followed by a collapse here at... Avenue des Fontaines! He places a pin right next to the “x” marking Flamel’s gr Scarlett gets where he’s going with this.
9) 15) dialog: Exactly!
9) 17) dialog: It would appear so.
9) 19) dialog: Again, there’s no “we” here.
10) 0) text: George and Scarlett approach the entrance to the official tourist area of the catacombs where other tourists wait i line. Scarlett buys tickets.
10) 2) dialog: Oh, no, I’m not going in. Just two tickets. Scarlett shoots George a strange look.
10) 4) dialog: I’m serious. I’m not going in there.
10) 6) dialog: I... have a thing.
10) 8) dialog: I don’t go underground.
10) 10) dialog: I know. But I never go underground.
10) 12) dialog: Regardless, you’re not getting me down there.
12) 0) text: George waits outside.
12) 2) dialog: Good.
13) 0) text: Scarlett, George and Benji get out of a cab.
13) 1) dialog: You sure this is the place?
14) 0) text: Scarlett, George and Benji enter a bizarre Parisian night that resembles a beautifully designed bunker. The Man points to the back of the room.
14) 15) dialog: Half is probably fine.
14) 19) dialog: Oh, I’m not going in. I’m just here for support.
14) 21) dialog: This guy seems to know what he’s doing.
14) 23) dialog: Text it to me and I'll...
14) 25) dialog: So there’s no way to call for help if something goes wrong?
14) 27) dialog: Then I’m definitely not going. A knock at the door.
15) 5) dialog: He lives down there?!
15) 7) dialog: Weird. Papillon points to a spot on the map.
15) 17) dialog: A week?! Papillon shrugs his shoulders.
16) 0) text: Scarlett and George follow Souxie, Papillon, and Zed into dark wooded area in a park in Paris. 33. Papillon stops them about 50 feet shy of a dirt mound wit hole in it, surrounded by concrete and graffiti. The hole looks more like something a raccoon would live in. He and Zed scan the area for police.
17) 1) dialog: You're going in that?! Seriously?
17) 6) dialog: What’s this?
17) 8) dialog: You have some serious listening skill issues. 34.
19) 0) text: George and Scarlett continue their discussion.
19) 2) dialog: Scarlett, I’m sorry.
19) 4) dialog: I’m not coming.
19) 11) dialog: Shit. Shit. Shit.
20) 0) text: Benji makes his way down though the jagged rocks as Zed points out the safe places to steps. George appears, with ruck sack.
20) 1) dialog: You fuckers. Shit! Scarlett looks around the catacombs. This is much rougher than the official tourist area, but in its way, much more beautiful. Paintings and graffiti on the walls give it an urban, cool vibe.
20) 4) dialog: Yeah, thanks. Papillon appears above, dropping like a bat into hell. He hits every wall on the way down.
20) 9) dialog: I don’t blame them. As the smoke clears, they see:
21) 11) dialog: There are over 200 miles of tunnels. You suggesting we wander them aimlessly until we find this weirdo?
22) 11) dialog: Scarlett. He’s right.
22) 13) dialog: You know I don’t want to spend an extra minute down here than I have to. But if this guy says he needs La Taupe, I’m inclined to trust him.
22) 15) dialog: If the stone is down here, it’s been here for six hundred years. (MORE )
22) 17) dialog: It’ll keep for a couple extra hours. She reluctantly relents.
22) 19) dialog: Now, don’t make me look like an asshole. As they cross through another room, strange electronic mu plays.
23) 2) dialog: You guys are freaks.
24) 0) text: As they cross through a corridor, Papillon points out a s replica of the Bocca della Verita in Rome. (A giant disk carved face with an open mouth.) He nudges George, points at it. 40.
24) 2) dialog: Let's give it a shot. He reaches his hand toward it, thinks for a moment.
24) 3) dialog: You might not believe this, but my nipples are perfectly shaped like little Elvis heads. Early Elvis. George slides his hand into the carved mouth.
24) 5) dialog: Aaah! Shit! I hate this place. Papillon has a good laugh at George.
24) 6) dialog: Yeah, thanks guy. As they cross to the far end of the corridor, they hear something -- A kind of industrial dance music. The beats build as they closer. Papillon looks to the others, does a little rave-y dance, smiles, and runs toward the music. George and Scarlett look to each other. This fucking guy. The music gets louder as they get closer. As they turn a bend, they see:
25) 0) text: AN underground rave, lit in flashing reds and pulsing tec music. People shuffle and dance like the possessed. At a glance, it looks like people might be having sex in dark corners. Others are scantily clad, in underwear or l People wearing masks and horns and animal headdresses. Th kind of underground party we all know probably happens somewhere, but would never get invited to ourselves. 41. Papillon pushes his way through the crowd, trying to ask people - through the noise - if they’ve seen La Taupe. A SKINHEAD grabs Scarlett, pulls her into the crowd, star grinding on her. He’s wearing nothing but combat boots an his underwear, revealing a swastika on his chest. Scarlett pushes away, but he’s aggressive. George jumps forward, hitting the Skinhead across the fac slamming him back through the crowd and onto his back. Other Ravers jump to the Skinhead’s aid, striking George the mouth. Scarlett tries to intervene on George’s behalf but no words can be heard over the pulsing music. People, very tough, very scary people corner George. One takes a swing, but George blocks it. George gets ready fo real fight. He’s amped up. Scarlett inserts herself between George and the crowd. Papillon pushes his way through, and holds the ravers off George. Scarlett and George push their way through the crowd and out of the room.
26) 0) text: As they clear the room, the flashlights overpower the strobes. They can hear again. George touches the back of his hand to his mouth and sees blood.
26) 1) dialog: (to Scarlett) You’re welcome.
26) 3) dialog: That guy was all over you.
26) 5) dialog: Yeah, really? 42.
26) 7) dialog: I literally punched a Nazi. How am I suddenly the asshole?
26) 9) dialog: Yeah? Since when?
26) 11) dialog: You?! That’s ridiculous. She draws a line in the sand on the floor. Stands on Geor side of it.
26) 13) dialog: I’m not going to push a girl.
26) 15) dialog: I’m not... this is so stupid. What, you have some self-defense-class-— karate-move you learned in case somebody tries to grab you? That’s all well and good unless somebody pushes you... 43. He rushes at her.
26) 16) dialog: 
26) 18) dialog: oh!
26) 21) dialog: I think he just called you a mushroom.
27) 12) dialog: Whoa! Papillon holds up a hand. Give me a sec. He walks off wit Taupe. 45.
27) 13) dialog: This doesn’t bode well. George and the gang watch Papillon and La Taupe exchange terse words. After a discussion, Papillon returns.
27) 16) dialog: If we still want him. Guy threw a bottle at my head.
27) 18) dialog: It skimmed my head. I felt it on my hair.
27) 20) dialog: Sleeps?! Did you say, “first he sleeps?!"
27) 22) dialog: Mushrooms?
27) 24) dialog: He’s on mushrooms?!
27) 26) dialog: How long ago did he eat them? 46.
27) 28) dialog: So he’s going to be high for like another six?! Scarlett looks at him. George shrugs his shoulders. I kno what's up.
27) 30) dialog: For the night?!
27) 32) dialog: No. Fuck this. I’m out. I gotta get out of this place. I’m packing my shit up and leaving.
27) 34) dialog: It’s that way. The camera pans off to show the long, dark corridor, Geor points at.
27) 36) dialog: You know, I’m getting real sick of your tone.
27) 38) dialog: You didn’t save me.
27) 40) dialog: Because I’m trapped under the ground! In a rat filled tunnel that was dug in the 1500s. Our tour guide is high as a kite and so far we've been walking in the wrong direction. What could possibly stop me from relaxing?! Papillon lights up a joint. Offers some to George.
27) 41) dialog: Perfect solution. Let’s everyone get high. I’m sure nothing bad could happen then. Papillon turns to walk away.
27) 42) dialog: Wait. Give me that. George has a hit off the joint.
27) 44) dialog: We have better in America. Papillon smiles. George does too. Maybe this won’t be so
28) 8) dialog: Not my favorite place. 49.
28) 10) dialog: It’s been awhile, hasn’t it.
28) 12) dialog: I know.
28) 14) dialog: I know.
28) 16) dialog: (reluctant) Yeah. Me too. If you’re right, this could be the greatest archaeological find... ever. As big as finding the Holy Grail.
28) 18) dialog: I used to love exploring caves with my brother as a kid. He was so daring and cool and older. He remembers it all so vividly.
28) 19) dialog: A rock I was standing on dislodged and rolled onto his leg, pinning him. We tried and tried but couldn’t get him out. I went to get help, but I got lost trying to find my way back. 50. This pains George terribly.
28) 20) dialog: By the time we found him, the tide had come in, and he was gone.
28) 22) dialog: Yeah. It was. He shrugs.
28) 23) dialog: It wasn’t because you left me there.
28) 25) dialog: Why I didn’t call you back. It wasn’t because you left me.
28) 27) dialog: I was afraid I was falling in love with someone so obsessed with the dead, there’s no room left over to love the living. She takes this in for a moment. Not one to take criticism easily.
28) 29) dialog: Shit. Camera powers off. 51.
29) 3) dialog: (under his breath) Asshole. The bleary-eyed explorers hustle to pack up and follow.
30) 0) text: La Taupe winds them through corridor after corridor. He k his way around here like his own neighborhood. George tries to talk with him. 52.
30) 1) dialog: Papillon told me you pretty much live down here?
30) 3) dialog: You do a lot of drugs, don’t you.
30) 5) dialog: I can’t imagine a place I'd less want to eat mushrooms. (thinks) Maybe jail. It’s a toss up.
31) 3) dialog: Yeah, we get it. La Taupe scrambles over the bones effortlessly. George goes next, followed by Scarlett, each crawling beh the next.
31) 5) dialog: Not sure why the French have such a reputation for being rude. I've always found them so pleasant. The camera moves with Scarlett as she climbs across the bones. She is anxious as the bones creak underneath her. swarm of rats make noise underneath. The tunnel gets tighter and tighter as they go, to the po that Scarlett is barely thin enough to fit through. Benji gets caught.
32) 7) dialog: Was that bad? They look to see a stone pillar that should be holding up ceiling has fallen.
32) 10) dialog: I think we should move out of this area. It seems suspect to me.
33) 0) text: La Taupe leads them into the next corridor. He shines his light around until he finds some planks of wood on the ground. He pries them up, revealing a hole in the floor t goes very deep. George looks at it.
33) 1) dialog: This is a bad idea, Scarlett.
33) 4) dialog: (to Scarlett) At what point will you stop?
33) 6) dialog: And if there is no stone?
34) 0) text: One after another, they descend deeper and deeper into th catacombs. They’re all feeling the tension of going this underground. George looks up to the vast distance above him.
34) 1) dialog: (to La Taupe) How do you know we’ll all be able to get back up there?
34) 3) dialog: Not really the answer I was hoping for.
35) 2) dialog: About 6 hours.
35) 6) dialog: (sings) Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, A tale of a fateful trip, That started from this tropic port Aboard this tiny ship. Scarlett smiles. Joins in. 59.
35) 7) dialog: The mate was a mighty sailing man, The skipper brave and sure. Five passengers set sail that day For a three hour tour... Benji jumps in too.
35) 20) dialog: Sorry Scarlett.
35) 22) dialog: I know. He sees how sad she is.
35) 23) dialog: For what it’s worth, I thought we had it right too. 61.
35) 25) dialog: Scarlett.
35) 27) dialog: What?
35) 29) dialog: Which by now would have produced Asee
36) 1) dialog: Oh my God. There’s something there!
36) 3) dialog: Don’t wreck it.
36) 5) dialog: What is it?
36) 9) dialog: “,..with brightest light, in darkest day.” She looks at the vulture up close.
36) 11) dialog: Really?! I’ve never seen one before. 63.
36) 16) dialog: Jesus. She gets ready to give it a shot. The cataphiles cautious back away, just in case.
36) 17) dialog: Wait! What are you doing?! Giving it the old college try?!
36) 19) dialog: Yeah. Go home. Not get crushed and die. She smiles at him.
36) 21) dialog: Against my better judgement, may I ask what your plan is? She opens her notebook...
36) 23) dialog: “Underneath heaven’s reign...”
36) 25) dialog: Wait! Was this built before or after Copernicus?
36) 27) dialog: So they still believed everything rotated around the Earth.
36) 29) dialog: But the moon was. As was the sun.
36) 31) dialog: That’s my count. She slides the stone out to the seventh line. The ceiling rumbles as the weight resettles. They look at it. Seems okay.
36) 32) dialog: What’s next?
36) 34) dialog: How far? Scarlett remembers the inscription out loud.
36) 36) dialog: Pair... twins?
36) 38) dialog: I don’t like this game. The stone slides toward them.
36) 40) dialog: What’s happening?
36) 43) dialog: No way I’m crawling through that.
36) 50) dialog: What is it?
36) 52) dialog: Shit. He climbs into the hole and struggles through it to join Scarlett.
37) 0) text: George comes out the other side and rolls out of the hole He stands to find: A tomb, atop which is laid A CORPSE, CLEARLY SEVERAL CENTURIES OLD, PERFECTLY PRESERVED. 67.
37) 1) dialog: Hello?
37) 3) dialog: How is he not rotting?
37) 5) dialog: C.R. Of R.C.
37) 7) dialog: No! The founder of the Rosecrucians?! Holy shit. (catches his language, apologizes to the corpse) Sorry. (to Scarlett) His tomb was found by Rosicrucians in the 1600s. Along with the secrets of...
37) 9) dialog: “VITRIOL.” What’s that?
37) 11) dialog: (translates) “Visit the Interior Parts of the Earth; by Rectification Thou Shalt Find the Hidden Stone.” The others have been filing in. 68.
37) 13) dialog: Yes. For 700 years.
37) 16) dialog: We're kind of interior already, don’t you think?
38) 2) dialog: Oh my God.
38) 4) dialog: It’s real. 70.
38) 6) dialog: I think we’re gonna need a bigger bag. La Taupe rises out of the water.
38) 9) dialog: How are these torches lit?
38) 11) dialog: So where is it? The stone.
38) 13) dialog: The sun. She smiles. She points at an ancient-Egyptian-inspired painting of a god stretched across the floor of the chamber.
38) 16) dialog: That’s it? It looks so ordinary. Scarlett smiles.
38) 22) dialog: Yeah. I think I’m okay.
38) 26) dialog: Papillon?! Souxie?! As the dust begins to settle, traces of their head lamps through the darkness. 73. The sounds of whimpering, muffled.
38) 27) dialog: I hear someone! The air clears a bit more. A hand sticks out of the rubbl George is on it in a second, pulling stones off and tossi them aside. Souxie breaks through the rubble. Coughing. In pain.
38) 28) dialog: Are you okay?
38) 31) dialog: Jesus. Papillon?! Nothing. George turns on La Taupe.
38) 32) dialog: You asshole! You could have killed us all! George goes after Taupe, but Scarlett and Zed intervene.
38) 37) dialog: Where’s the first aid kit? We need to clean up that cut. They all look around.
38) 39) dialog: Water? Food? They all look at each other. Nothing.
38) 42) dialog: Let’s start conserving. George turns his off, dropping the light of the space dow considerably. Benji does the same. George pokes around at the rubble, looking for a way out.
38) 43) dialog: Maybe we could dig our way out.
38) 46) dialog: So what, we just sit here and wait for the air to run out?! (MORE )
38) 48) dialog: We're all just cool hanging out waiting to die?! George looks around the room. They’re all trying to wrap their heads around the situation. Terrified. Scarlett looks closer at the structure around them.
38) 50) dialog: So?
38) 53) dialog: What is it?
38) 55) dialog: So it’s a door?! George grabs a rock and gets ready to chisel at it.
38) 57) dialog: So?
38) 59) dialog: So if...
38) 61) dialog: Then there would be a door on the floor too.
38) 63) dialog: (to La Taupe) That water must be going somewhere. Scarlett doubles her efforts, hitting the shit out of the rock until.
38) 68) dialog: Oh, going deeper. Scarlett picks a rope and lowers herself down into the ch The descent is eerie, dark. They watch as she goes. And goes. And goes. Scarlett stops. She takes a flashlight and shines it arou looking at what’s in front of her.
39) 2) dialog: “Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.” Scarlett understands. 78.
39) 10) dialog: Yeah. That occurred to me too.
40) 0) text: Scarlett stands up in the next room to find: IT’S EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ALCHEMIST CHAMBER THAT COLLA ON THEM. Same artwork on the ceiling. Same gold. Same mis Philosopher’s Stone. Though this room is still intact. 79. It sounds a bit different this side of the threshold. Lik faint throbbing drone in the background. George stands up behind Scarlett, looks around.
40) 1) dialog: Whoa. She looks at him.
41) 0) text: Scarlett comes up on the other side. A mirror image of th rose chamber. The same tomb. THIS TIME WITH A ROTTEN CORP ATOP IT. Scarlett looks around nervously. The others join her, one at a time. George looks past Scarlett.
41) 1) dialog: (calling out) Hello? She spins to find. A FIGURE STANDING AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM. In the dark it’s hard to see more than a faint shape. George's voice echoes through the long chamber. No reaction. Nothing. They all look at each other, not sure what to do.
41) 2) dialog: Can you hear me? Nothing. The figure moves a little, muttering quietly to himself - like a man possessed.
41) 4) dialog: What are you doing?
41) 11) dialog: How’d you get here? Nothing. Souxie moves closer. They all follow her.
41) 20) dialog: Over there! Nothing.
41) 21) dialog: Where’d he go?
41) 26) dialog: Okay. Okay. La Taupe lost his mask in the struggle, revealing TERRIBL BURN SCARS ON HALF HIS FACE. He helps George and Scarlett lift Souxie. They rush her to the small opening at the end of the cham exactly the same as the one behind the Ptolemaic hinged d
43) 2) dialog: I’m coming first. So I can help pull. George climbs through. He drops into the water beside Scarlett. He too notes the “water.”
43) 3) dialog: Is this blood? 84.
43) 5) dialog: It tastes like blood. I think...
43) 7) dialog: Yeah. George and Scarlett pull Souxie through the tunnel while keeping an eye behind themselves, just in case.
45) 1) dialog: Great. Everything is the mirror image of what we’ve already done, but somehow it keeps going deeper.
45) 4) dialog: Making it... 1000 feet beneath the earth’s surface. That’s pretty deep.
45) 6) dialog: Yeah, I get it. 85.
