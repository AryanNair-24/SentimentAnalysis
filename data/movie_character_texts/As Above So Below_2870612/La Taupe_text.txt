Others are scantily clad, in underwear or l People wearing masks and horns and animal headdresses. Th kind of underground party we all know probably happens somewhere, but would never get invited to ourselves. 41. Papillon pushes his way through the crowd, trying to ask people - through the noise - if they’ve seen La Taupe. A SKINHEAD grabs Scarlett, pulls her into the crowd, star grinding on her. He’s wearing nothing but combat boots an his underwear, revealing a swastika on his chest. Scarlett pushes away, but he’s aggressive. George jumps forward, hitting the Skinhead across the fac slamming him back through the crowd and onto his back. Other Ravers jump to the Skinhead’s aid, striking George the mouth. Scarlett tries to intervene on George’s behalf but no words can be heard over the pulsing music. People, very tough, very scary people corner George. One takes a swing, but George blocks it. George gets ready fo real fight. He’s amped up. Scarlett inserts herself between George and the crowd. Papillon pushes his way through, and holds the ravers off George. Scarlett and George push their way through the crowd and out of the room.
