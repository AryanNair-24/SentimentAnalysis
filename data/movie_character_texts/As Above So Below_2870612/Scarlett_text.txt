A chaotic scene with men, women, chil all shouting in Farsi. Brief glimpses of a mountainous landscape through the shaky windows. This bus could reall use some new shocks and a better muffler. The camera rises, turns around revealing its operator, a WOMAN wearing a hajib (a traditional Arabian headdress). slumps low in her seat for privacy, looks around cautious and carefully lowers her veil revealing -- SCARLETT DURANG, mid 20s, an adventurous British archaeologist. The kind of cat that gets killed by curios Her off-the-charts intellect and multiple post-grad degre are barely concealed by her striking good looks and punk inclinations. Judging from the cloth that edges frame, she is obviously shooting with a small camera attached to her hajib. She whispers to the camera - alert, but not scared.
0) 1) dialog: I'm approximately 20 miles inside the Iranian border en route to the Habala region where they have ordered the destruction of a network of caves at sundown tonight. I believe these caves might contain a critical missing piece of our history. A piece I can’t let them destroy. She turns the camera back around, then pauses and goes ba to her face. SCARLETT (CONT’D) Oh, and if I’m found dead, please know I entered the country of my own free will, fully knowing the penalty for trespassing here is burial up to your neck in sand and having a rock wall pushed on top of you. Which, you know, seems perfectly appropriate. She grins mischievously. SCARLETT (CONT’D) But they’1l have to catch me first.
1) 0) text: Sun is almost touching the horizon. The camera shakes as Scarlett crosses through a sparsely populated marketplace as megaphones in the background dem everyone clear the area. Scarlett is careful to keep pace with REZA, a mousy Persi with a neatly trimmed moustache and a weathered knockoff Tommy Hilfiger T-shirt. He leads her to a small, rock hut a home.
2) 2) dialog: Yeah. I know. Reza nods to his WIFE, in traditional garb. She nods back slides some sooty wooden shelves aside revealing --

Reza drops down right behind her. A grinding sound as Reza’s wife slides the bookshelves ba into place, obliterating the light above. Once Scarlett gets her footing, she shines her flashlight down the cave corridor. It's long and dark. It's about 4 tall, forcing Scarlett and Reza into a crouched scamper.
2) 11) dialog: They're not blowing the caves until sundown, right? Scarlett checks her watch. SCARLETT (CONT’D) Should give us a few more minutes.
2) 13) dialog: Which way is it? I'll go without you.

She continues reading the inscriptions. SCARLETT (CONT’D) There’s more. She looks around frantically, grabs a rock off the floor.

2) 26) dialog: I just need a minute.
2) 29) dialog: Oh my God! Do you know what this is?! It takes her a moment to snap to. Reza grabs her and physically tries to escort her away.
2) 31) dialog: I have been searching for this all my life! Go! I’1l catch up!
2) 33) dialog: Come on. The light creates eerie shadows of the statue on vaulted ceilings of the chamber. She's painfully slow making sure to get every detail of t ancient relic. The voices from the megaphones are getting louder and more foreboding. The voice in the megaphone seems to be doing a countdown, in the foreign language, it’s hard to tell which number i down to. Scarlett knows how close she’s cutting this, but she won’ lose this piece of history. She continues swiping the gre laser line from the scanner over every side of the bull. She's done! She grabs her headdress and runs like hell.

It’s a replica an arcane drawing of the heavenly bodies above the earth, ground, and hell within. But the thing that makes this interesting... the distances are noted.
7) 69) dialog: According to the alchemists, the number of the Devil was 741. Makes sense they would believe hell to be 741 feet beneath the surface of the earth.

11) 5) dialog: I can squeeze through this. Wait for me. She climbs through the gap in the walls and disappears in the darkness.

Had he been born half a century ago, Papillon surely woul have been a leader of the French Resistance, but in these times must amuse himself with less constructive forms of rebellion. SCARLETT (CONT’D) Papillon?

14) 6) dialog: Do I look like a tourist? He smiles. Takes a sip of his drink. 29.
14) 8) dialog: Because we've found a secret passage that nobody knows about. Papillon looks at the markings. Shakes his head.
14) 10) dialog: No you wouldn’t have. It was designed to not be seen.
14) 12) dialog: Because, I believe, it’s full of treasure. Papillon laughs. Looks to George.
14) 14) dialog: You can have it all. That’s not what we're looking for.

Papillon stops them about 50 feet shy of a dirt mound wit hole in it, surrounded by concrete and graffiti. The hole looks more like something a raccoon would live in. He and Zed scan the area for police.

Others are scantily clad, in underwear or l People wearing masks and horns and animal headdresses. Th kind of underground party we all know probably happens somewhere, but would never get invited to ourselves. 41. Papillon pushes his way through the crowd, trying to ask people - through the noise - if they’ve seen La Taupe. A SKINHEAD grabs Scarlett, pulls her into the crowd, star grinding on her. He’s wearing nothing but combat boots an his underwear, revealing a swastika on his chest. Scarlett pushes away, but he’s aggressive. George jumps forward, hitting the Skinhead across the fac slamming him back through the crowd and onto his back. Other Ravers jump to the Skinhead’s aid, striking George the mouth. Scarlett tries to intervene on George’s behalf but no words can be heard over the pulsing music. People, very tough, very scary people corner George. One takes a swing, but George blocks it. George gets ready fo real fight. He’s amped up. Scarlett inserts herself between George and the crowd. Papillon pushes his way through, and holds the ravers off George. Scarlett and George push their way through the crowd and out of the room.

26) 10) dialog: (playful) Don’t kid yourself. You wouldn’t want to go toe-to-toe with me. I’m pretty tough.
26) 12) dialog: Try to move me across this line. I’1l show you. Papillon laughs and claps.
26) 14) dialog: Because you’re scared of her?
26) 19) dialog: I might know a little more than a self-defense-class-karate-move. Papillon laughs, raises her hand up in victory.
27) 15) dialog: Great.

It’s kind of beautiful. Souxie takes something out of a small kit. She crosses ou the room into the darkness of a tunnel by herself. Papillon drinks beer and talks with Scarlett and La Taupe Zed practices throwing rocks into a bucket.
28) 2) dialog: I’m not really. 48.
28) 5) dialog: Science was different back then. Alchemists were looking for a connection between what was inside them and what they were observing in the outside world. They were trying to perfect themselves, make themselves pure as gold while working in metals. They respected inner truth more than outside facts. She turns back to Papillon. SCARLETT (CONT’D) I guess I’m not searching for treasure so much as I’m searching for proof of the miraculous. Because if even one alchemist succeeded, if one perfected himself and his own mind and talents and knowledge to the point that he could bend the laws of physics... then we all could. Every one of us. Papillon shrugs. Maybe.
28) 7) dialog: You okay? George shrugs a bit.
28) 9) dialog: So I gathered. She offers George a beer. He takes it. SCARLETT (CONT’D) When’s the last time we had a beer together?
28) 11) dialog: You never returned my calls. After Turkey.

28) 21) dialog: That’s awful. I’m sorry.
28) 24) dialog: What’s that?
28) 26) dialog: It wasn’t? He looks at her seriously.
28) 28) dialog: And I never thought I’d fall for the kind of guy who runs the second things get complicated. She turns and goes back to the fire with the others.
29) 4) dialog: (to Papillon) This “Mole” guy always so annoying? Papillon shakes his head.
31) 10) dialog: Can you take off your pack?
31) 12) dialog: You're making it worse! Stop struggling. Take a breathe.
31) 14) dialog: Benji stop! Stop! You need to back up a bit. You’re lodged and...
31) 16) dialog: Move back. Just inch back. 54.
31) 18) dialog: Benji! The only way forward is backward! INCH BACK! INCH BACK!
31) 21) dialog: Move your right shoulder down and inch back. Benji moves. SCARLETT (CONT’D) No, no, no, I’m sorry. Your left shoulder.
31) 23) dialog: Keep breathing. Just take a deep breath with me.
31) 25) dialog: Take a deep breath! Scarlett takes a deep breath and exhales. SCARLETT (CONT’D) Your body expands when your blood pressure rises. You need to calm yourself. Come on. She does it again. He joins her this time.
31) 27) dialog: You're going to be okay. Move your right shoulder down an inch.
31) 29) dialog: That's right. Now see if you can adjust the bones underneath you. Flatten them out, line them up.
31) 32) dialog: Just do it.
31) 35) dialog: It’s okay. It’s okay, Benji. You’re going to be fine. Just follow me. Benji pulls against the cave. It rumbles slightly.
31) 37) dialog: Just push! Push through it! He does. And finally breaks free.
32) 2) dialog: We didn’t even have to go through there?! Why are you making this harder than it has to be?!
32) 4) dialog: I don’t care who you think you are, but the next time you take a chance with my people, I’1l hurt you. Seriously. La Taupe’s mouth, showing under his mole mask, smiles.
32) 9) dialog: We're still not deep enough. We’re only two hundred feet below ground. We need to go down another hundred. The ceiling dusts them again. 57.
32) 11) dialog: (to La Taupe) We need to go deeper. He reluctantly nods.
33) 2) dialog: Papillon, could you take George and anyone else back who wants to go? I’m going deeper.
33) 5) dialog: When I find it.
33) 7) dialog: There is. And it’s down there. She nods to La Taupe.
35) 7) dialog: The mate was a mighty sailing man, The skipper brave and sure. Five passengers set sail that day For a three hour tour... Benji jumps in too.
35) 12) dialog: Should be another ten feet that way. 60.
35) 14) dialog: There must be another way to get there. La Taupe consults his own personal map of the system of caves. He shakes his head.
35) 17) dialog: I don’t know.
35) 19) dialog: There’s nothing.
35) 21) dialog: I really thought we had it right.
35) 26) dialog: Yeah... Scarlett looks down at the compass on her wrist. A flash insight! SCARLETT (CONT’D) Wait! Wait! Direction! Magnetic north!
35) 28) dialog: Magnetic north! True north remains fixed, but magnetic north shifts about 2.5 degrees per hundred years.
35) 30) dialog: Variation of about 15 degrees. Not here. There! A second small tunnel leading off the one they’re in. The race into it.
36) 0) text: Scarlett throws her pack down and scans the walls with he fingers. She digs into the stone. Sees something.

36) 8) dialog: What was it?! “Winged vulture leads your way.”
36) 10) dialog: “Winged vulture leads your way...” She follows the angle of the vulture’s beak across the wa until it hits a second wall. She digs around at the joint of the two walls. Sure enoug there’s a crease! SCARLETT (CONT’D) There’s something here! George is there in a flash. SCARLETT (CONT’D) I think it’s a Ptolemaic hinge! It looks like a scarab embedded in the stone. She kneels and finds another one.
36) 13) dialog: It’s how they sealed pharaohs' tombs in ancient Egypt. The hinges formed a kind of riddle almost like an ancient padlock. There are a series of moves you must get precisely correct.
36) 15) dialog: Or it’1ll fall on you and crush you. Or the ceiling would collapse, or something else awful that would probably kill you.
36) 18) dialog: You have a better idea?
36) 20) dialog: Okay, you do that, but I’m going to take a shot. He hesitates for a moment.
36) 22) dialog: What was the... on the tomb... 64.
36) 24) dialog: Heaven's reign. The celestial spheres! 8 planets. Except Uranus wasn’t discovered yet. 7 planets. She gets ready to pull the door.
36) 26) dialog: Good point. Before.
36) 28) dialog: Which means, the Earth was not counted as a planet.
36) 30) dialog: So eight?
36) 33) dialog: Now we twist.
36) 35) dialog: .-. “atop this pair'ed fate.” 65.
36) 37) dialog: Twins! Of course, Gemini! According to the Egyptian calendar, Gemini would fall at three o’clock on a dial. Ready? George nods nervously. Papillon backs up. She twists the stone and it spirals outward as it moves. SCARLETT (CONT’D) Okay... okay... Gemini. She stops. The ceiling rumbles a bit again. Sand pours fr beside the stone as the rumbling intensifies.
36) 39) dialog: Back up! La Taupe runs for the door.

The camera travels with Scarlett under the water as her h pokes at the stone deep in the water. She rises back up, now soaking wet. SCARLETT (CONT’D) There’s a loose stone. Someone help me. Papillon jumps in with her. The two drop into the water. Again the camera drops in with them as they pull against large stone. They dislodge it and pull it away from the w revealing more light.

38) 15) dialog: Every morning the sky gives birth to the sun and every evening she swallows him back up. She takes out a knife and makes her way to the winged sto With all the opulence surrounding them, this one chalky purple stone would hardly be worth noting.
