23) 16) dialog: (smiles) She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
23) 20) dialog: You want me to leave?
23) 24) dialog: Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
23) 28) dialog: She still is.

23) 36) dialog: Nope.
23) 40) dialog: Nope.
23) 44) dialog: I, uh, know a guy at the power company.

23) 52) dialog: (smiles) I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
23) 58) text: Cynthia goes over to the box and looks inside for a long studying the labels.
23) 60) dialog: Oh, okay. I think I get it.
23) 64) dialog: Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
23) 68) dialog: Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
23) 72) dialog: Doing what?
23) 76) dialog: About what?
23) 80) dialog: What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
23) 84) dialog: You just want to ask me questions?
23) 88) dialog: And that's all?
23) 92) dialog: (a crooked smile) Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
23) 96) dialog: Would anybody else see the tape?
23) 100) dialog: How do we start?
23) 104) dialog: And you ask questions, right?
23) 108) dialog: How long will it take?
23) 112) dialog: Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what--
23) 116) dialog: (thinks) Do I sit or stand?

23) 135) dialog: (thinks) I was...eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.

23) 143) dialog: When I was fourteen.
23) 147) dialog: Very much live.
23) 151) dialog: Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
23) 155) dialog: No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
23) 159) dialog: It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
23) 163) dialog: He said that my hand felt good.
23) 167) dialog: Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
24) 1) text: Cynthia, adjusting her clothes, opens the door to leave. looks very aroused. She and Graham do not speak or touch.

26) 3) dialog: (voice on tape) Would you like me to take my pants off?
26) 7) dialog: (voice on tape) Do you like the way I look?

30) 76) dialog: He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
30) 80) dialog: No. I don't think they all did what I did.
30) 84) dialog: Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
