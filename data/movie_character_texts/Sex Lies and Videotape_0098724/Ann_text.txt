This happened to me before when  that barge with all the garbage  was stranded and nobody would take  it? Remember that?

1) 9) dialog: Don't you think that's a lot of  garbage? I'd really like to know  where it's all going to go.
1) 13) dialog: Well, this weekend John was taking  out the garbage, and he kept  spilling things out of the  container, and I started imagining  a container that grew garbage,  like it just kept filling up and  overflowing all by itself, and  how could you stop that if it  started happening?
1) 21) dialog: Yeah, so?
1) 25) dialog: Well, do you think many people  run around thinking about how happy  they feel and how great things  are? I mean, maybe they do, but  I doubt those people are in  therapy. Besides, being happy isn't  all that great. My figure is always  at its best when I'm depressed.  The last time I was really happy  I put on twenty-five pounds. I  thought John was going to have  a stroke.
3) 5) dialog: (voice over) No. I don't know. I haven't told  him about the garbage thing because  I'm pissed off at him right now.  He's letting some old college buddy  stay at our house for a couple  of days, and he didn't even ask  me about it. I mean, I would've  said yes, I just wish he would've  asked.
4) 4) dialog: I guess I'm upset because I can't  really justify being upset, I mean,  it's his house, really, he pays  the mortgage.

5) 5) dialog: (voice over) About a week ago. I don't know  what brought it on, I just started  feeling like I didn't want him  to touch me.
5) 9) dialog: (voice over) Oh, yeah. (pause) But see, I've never really been  into sex that much, I mean, I like  it and everything, it just does't  freak me out, I wouldn't miss it,  you know? But anyway, lately we  haven't been doing anything at  all. Like I said, it's not that  I miss it, but I m curious the  way things kind of slacked off  all of a sudden.
5) 14) dialog: (voice over) But see, he stopped before I got  that feeling, that's why it seems  weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he  wishes I would initiate things  once in awhile, and I would  except it never occurs to me, I'm  always thinking about something  else and then the few times that I  have felt like starting something  I was by myself.
5) 19) dialog: (voice over)  What do you mean?
6) 2) dialog: (taken aback)  God, no.
6) 6) dialog: (slightly uncomfortable)  Well, I kind of tried once. It  just seemed stupid, I kept seeing  myself lying there and it seemed  stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't  know, and then I was wondering  if my dead grandfather could see  me doing this, and it just seemed  like a dumb thing to be doing when  we don't know what to do with all  that garbage, you know?
6) 10) dialog: (exhales, head down) Well, kind of recently, I guess.  But not too recently.
6) 13) dialog: I'm really not up to having a guest  in the house.
8) 2) text: Graham knocks at the door. He is stubbing out a cigarette his beaten tennis shoe when Ann answers the door. She is to hide her suprise at his appearance.

9) 57) dialog: (thinks)  No, not really.
9) 61) dialog: You play an instrument?
9) 65) dialog: (caught slightly off guard) Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
9) 69) dialog: Well.....well, the clichГ© about the security of it, that's really  true. We own a house, and I really  like that, you know? And I like  that John was just made junior  partner, so he has a steady job  and he's not some...
9) 70) text: Ann looks at Graham and stops. He smiles again.
9) 72) dialog: ...free-lance. You know.
9) 76) dialog: Oh, definitely. I mean, just this  past year has gone by like phew!  I hardly even knew it passed.
9) 79) text: Ann is fascinated, if a bit overwhelmed.
9) 85) dialog: You mean like "time flies"?
9) 89) dialog: How long has it been since you've  seen John?
9) 97) dialog: Why? Didn't you know him well?
9) 102) dialog: Why'd you drop out?
9) 106) dialog: That's hard to believe. The two  of you seem so different.
9) 109) text: Graham gets up and heads for the toilet. Ann watches him a bemused smile on her face. After she hears the door clo she can't resist the impulse to take a closer look at Gra bag.

10) 5) dialog: (to Graham)  You did that?
10) 16) dialog: Thank you.
10) 22) dialog: (nods, chewing)  Mother, father, sister.
10) 26) dialog: Younger.
10) 30) text: Graham sees Ann and John exchange looks.
10) 41) text: Ann laughs.
10) 44) text: Ann's smile fades. John resumes eating.
10) 46) dialog: Oh, we get along okay. She's just  very...she's an extrovert. I think  she's loud. She probably wouldn't  agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
10) 53) dialog: (interested) Who's Elizabeth?
10) 58) dialog: Graham and I were talking about  apartments and I told him to check  the Garden District, there are  some nice little places there,  garage apartments and stuff.
10) 77) text: Ann takes her plate into the kitchen.
10) 84) dialog: (from the kitchen)  What's the first?
10) 87) text: John smiles, thinking. Graham follows Ann into the kitche John shouts after them.

15) 1) text: Graham and Ann are having lunch. Ann looks to have had a of wine. Graham drinks club soda with a twist.
15) 3) dialog: It's hard to explain. It's like... John treats everybody the same, you know? I mean, he acts just as excited about seeing somebody he hardly knows as he does when he sees me. And so I feel like, what's different about me, if I'm treated exactly the same as some acquaintance? If I don't like somebody, I don't act like I do. I guess that's why a lot of people think I'm a bitch.
15) 8) dialog: I feel like they do.
15) 11) text: Ann smiles.
15) 15) dialog: Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
15) 18) dialog: Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
15) 22) dialog: Okay. I think...I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do. (smiles) I'm getting confused.
15) 25) dialog: Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
15) 29) dialog: Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.
15) 30) text: Graham watches Ann take a sip of wine.
15) 34) dialog: Kids? What about them?
15) 38) dialog: Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
15) 42) dialog: I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
15) 45) dialog: So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
15) 49) dialog: As long as it's not...gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
15) 55) text: Ann looks at him closely.
15) 57) dialog: You're what?
15) 61) dialog: You are?
15) 64) text: Ann takes a large sip of wine. Graham lights a cigarette.
15) 66) dialog: Does it bother you?
15) 70) dialog: Well...are you self-conscious about it?
15) 74) dialog: Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
15) 78) dialog: What?
15) 82) dialog: (thinks) My therapist said that--
15) 86) dialog: Aren't you?
15) 90) dialog: So you don't believe in therapy?
15) 94) dialog: Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
15) 98) dialog: Of course not.
15) 102) dialog: Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
15) 104) text: Ann takes another sip of wine and thinks for a moment.
15) 106) dialog: Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
16) 3) dialog: (voice over) So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
17) 2) dialog: Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and--
17) 6) dialog: Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and--you've never heard of this?
17) 10) dialog: Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you. (pause) I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
17) 14) dialog: What visitor?
17) 18) dialog: Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this...well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this...this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
17) 22) dialog: No, he left last week.
17) 26) dialog: What do you mean, like physically?
17) 30) dialog: (thinks) I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him. (pause) After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
18) 1) text: Ann stands watching Cynthia get dressed for work.
18) 3) dialog: I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
18) 7) dialog: No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.
18) 12) dialog: Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him...he's just kind of...I don't know, unusual.
18) 16) dialog: Why?
18) 20) dialog: Why, so you can go after him?
18) 23) text: Ann says nothing.
18) 27) dialog: Do you have to say that?
18) 31) dialog: You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
18) 35) dialog: Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
18) 39) dialog: Well, I wonder why.
18) 43) dialog: Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
18) 47) dialog: I have a pretty good idea.
18) 51) dialog: He doesn't have a phone.
18) 55) dialog: But he won't.
18) 59) dialog: He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
18) 63) dialog: Let me talk to him first.
18) 67) dialog: I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
18) 71) dialog: And...do whatever it is you do.
18) 72) text: Cynthia laughs loudly. Ann, not happy, watches her dig th the jewelry box.
18) 74) dialog: Lose something?
18) 78) dialog: Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
18) 82) dialog: A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
18) 86) dialog: Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It s her fiftieth birthday--
18) 90) dialog: I just thought it might--
18) 94) dialog: Fine.
19) 2) dialog: I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
19) 6) dialog: I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
19) 10) dialog: That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was...well, he said a lot of stuff.
19) 15) dialog: What do you mean? I don't understand.
19) 19) dialog: I guess.
19) 23) dialog: Yes.
19) 27) dialog: Yes.
19) 31) dialog: Not really.
19) 35) dialog: Yes.
19) 39) dialog: But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?

20) 43) dialog: Who's Donna?
20) 47) dialog: Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
20) 51) dialog: You went out with her?
20) 54) text: Ann looks in the box again.
20) 56) dialog: How come all these are girl's names?
20) 61) dialog: All of these are interviews?
20) 65) dialog: Can we look at one?
20) 69) dialog: Why not?
20) 72) text: Ann looks at Graham for a long moment, then back at the t

20) 78) dialog: About sex?
20) 82) dialog: What about sex?
20) 86) dialog: Like what?
20) 90) dialog: You just ask them questions?
20) 94) dialog: And they just answer them?
20) 98) dialog: To you?
20) 102) dialog: (stunned) I don't ...why...why do you do this?
20) 106) dialog: This is just...so...
20) 110) dialog: Yes, I do.

21) 15) dialog: Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
21) 19) dialog: No!
21) 23) dialog: No, it's nothing like that.
21) 27) dialog: No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
21) 31) dialog: I don't want to talk about it.
21) 35) dialog: I don't know.
21) 36) text: Ann hangs up.
27) 18) dialog: (voice over) I hate my sister.
28) 4) dialog: (rambling) Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people  have to be so obsessed with sex all  what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?
29) 1) text: Ann lies awake in bed beside John, who is sound asleep.

30) 30) dialog: Why did you do that?
30) 34) dialog: But why did you want to?
30) 38) dialog: Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be...bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
