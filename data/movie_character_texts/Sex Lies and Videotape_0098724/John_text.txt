37) 38) dialog: I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
37) 42) dialog: I'm not either!!
37) 46) dialog: Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
37) 50) dialog: Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."

37) 59) dialog: I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
37) 63) dialog: Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.

38) 11) dialog: Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
38) 15) dialog: What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
38) 19) dialog: Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
38) 23) dialog: Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
38) 27) dialog: Interact, fine, but did you have to masturbate in front of him, for God's sake? I mean...
38) 32) dialog: You told Ann about this?
38) 36) dialog: I wish you hadn't done that.
38) 40) dialog: It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
38) 44) dialog: I just...Ann is very...
38) 48) dialog: It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
38) 52) dialog: You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
38) 56) dialog: (disbelieving) You trust him.
38) 60) dialog: What do you mean?
38) 64) dialog: It hurts that you would say that to me.
38) 68) dialog: By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
38) 72) dialog: Look, are we going to do it or not?
38) 76) dialog: (ingratiating) Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
