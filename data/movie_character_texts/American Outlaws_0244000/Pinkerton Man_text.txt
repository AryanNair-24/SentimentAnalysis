61) 20) dialog: By burning down their homes?
61) 22) dialog: Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.

70) 7) dialog: Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them.

Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
73) 7) dialog: And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes.
73) 9) dialog: They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
73) 12) dialog: (dryly) Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
73) 14) dialog: No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course, (jerking his head at Parker) You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
