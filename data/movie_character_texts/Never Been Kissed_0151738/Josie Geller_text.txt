When you  get there, it won't matter if you  were prom queen or the quarterback  or the biggest nerd in school.  What matters is that you don't  regret who you were, who you are- What if Steven Spielberg had quit  the audio/visual club because it  wasn't "cool"? What if Rosie  O'Donnell had stopped cracking  jokes because someone told her  they were stupid?  What if Michael  Jordan never went back to basketball  after he got cut from his high  school team?.

152) 0) text: Josie sits at her disk, typing on her laptop, engrossed.
152) 1) dialog: Someone once told me that to write  well you have to write what you  know. This is what I know. I am  twenty five years old. I have never  really kissed a guy. A geek to the  core, most of my childhood years  were spent doing extra homework I  requested from the teacher.
153) 0) text: Gus comes in, snaps on the light, sits at his desk, and  opens his newspaper. He pulls out, the "Life and Style"  section. And there it is. Front page - "NEVER BEEN KISSED BY JOSIE GELLER."  There are three pictures next to the article.  One is Josie at age 17, one is her recent prom picture,  and one is her as a normal, 25 yr. old adult.
153) 1) dialog: High school was more of the same.  Then, at seventeen, it seemed as  if my luck was about to change.  The cutest guy in school asked me  to senior prom - but it turned out  he invited me as a cruel joke. I  have never fully recovered.
154) 1) dialog: Yes, it is embarrassing to share  this with the world. But it would  be hard to explain what I learned,  and how I learned it, without  sharing this humiliating history.
155) 1) dialog: I received an assignment, my first  as a reporter, to enroll in high  school as a student, to gain some  insight into kids today.  Understandably, returning to high  school was my worst nightmare.
156) 1) dialog: What I found?
157) 1) dialog: There's still that one teacher,  who marches to her own drummer-
157) 3) dialog: Those girls are still there. The  ones that, even as you grow up,  will still be the most beautiful  girls that you've ever seen close  up.
158) 2) dialog: The athletes - and the immense  sense of fraternity and loyalty  that they share-
159) 4) dialog: The smart kids. Who everyone else  always knew as the brains. But who  I just knew as my soulmates, my  teachers, my friends.
160) 3) dialog: And there's still that one guy,  the one who is so perfect in every  way, from the muscles in his  shoulders-
161) 3) dialog: - to the way he, in his own way,  struggles to uphold tradition.   Southglen would not have been the  same without him. High school would  not be the same without him. I  would not have been the same without  him.
162) 3) dialog: All of these things made me  miserable at seventeen. But at  twenty five I finally see that  this - all of this- is just the  way it should be. It is all part  of this thing- high school. A time  in our lives that we can never  truly repeat.  A time that shapes  us. A time that makes us who we  are, for years to come.
163) 2) dialog: High school- going through it the  first time- helped make me who I  am. But going there a second time  made me see that who I am is O.K.  I always wanted to be "in", but  seven years later, when they finally  opened the door, I somehow gained  the confidence to stay outside,  firmly, happily.
164) 0) text: About 75% of the people have their Life and Style section opened, reading Josie's piece.
164) 1) dialog: This is not the article I was sent  in to write. This is the article I  needed to write. I lived a lifetime  of regret after my first high school  experience, and now, after my  second, my regrets are down to  one.
165) 1) dialog: A certain teacher was trampled in  my path to self-discovery, and  though this article may serve as a  step, it in no way makes up for  what I did to him.
165) 3) dialog: To this man, you know who you are,  I am so sorry.
165) 5) dialog: And, I would like to add one more  thing - I think I am in love with  you.
166) 1) dialog: And so I propose this - as an ending  to this article, and, perhaps, as  an ending to this portion of my  life. I, Josie Geller, will be at  the State Championship baseball  game В– where my friends the  Southglen Rams are playing for the  title.
167) 1) dialog: I will stand on the pitcher's mound  for the five minutes prior to the  first pitch. If this man accepts  my apology, I ask him to come to  kiss me, in front of everyone, for  my first real kiss.
167) 2) text: We find a nervous looking Josie standing in the dugout.
167) 3) dialog: Five minutes may seem like a short  time, but trust me, when you've  been waiting twenty-five years,  it's usually the last five minutes  that kill you.
167) 5) dialog: I went back to high school and  discovered I was a loser, again.
168) 0) text: Sam enters, still in sweats, carrying a book. He opens th fridge, grabs a beer, shuts it, is confronted by Josie's  picture. He takes it down, looks at it.
168) 1) dialog: And then I discovered it wasn't so  bad. I wasn't so bad. So, now that  I'm ready to start living the rest  of my life, it would be magical if  I could live the rest of it with  him.
168) 3) dialog: Because inside everyone is a loser  afraid to be loved, and out there  is the one person who can kiss us  and make it all better.
168) 4) text: WE FOLLOW Sam's stare down into the trash and see the pho lying on top and to the side of Josie's article--the phot from the article are clearly visible.
