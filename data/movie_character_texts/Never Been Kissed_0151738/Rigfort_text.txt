10) 0) text: It's packed with the NEWSPAPER STAFF. HYRAM RIGFORT, 65,  white-haired, dignified owner of the paper presides. Anit and Josie sit next to each other. Next to Anita sits Roge from Op/Ed, a good-looking guy in his 30's.
10) 1) dialog: Let me start out by saying that I  was very impressed by the  investigative piece Dutton did on  pesticides in our supermarkets.
10) 3) dialog: But since the Trib did a better  piece on the same subject, you're  fired.
10) 5) dialog: You heard me. Out. Out.
10) 7) dialog: So. Happy March everybody!
10) 9) dialog: To celebrate, I've decided it's  time for another undercover feature!
10) 11) dialog: You all know that some of my best  inspiration comes from personal  experience. Who knew that my botched  foray into hair plugs would lead  to last month's award-winning expose --  "hair today, gone tomorrow"? Hat's  off to you, Bruns.
10) 13) dialog: Or should I say "hat's on"! And  what about when my wife had that  affair with Gil, her ski instructor  and Howard went undercover as an  expert slalom skier.
10) 14) text: Howard smiled wanly. Both his arms are in casts. CAMERA  PANS the room as Rigfort continues, picking out different reporters.
10) 15) dialog: So last night I'm sitting around  the dinner table with my family.  The wife, the two nannies, the  boys, and we're eating chicken  with this peanut sauce.
10) 18) dialog: Hang on, Gus. So, we're eating  this peanut sauce and suddenly the  younger kid starts choking.
10) 21) dialog: Turns out he's allergic to peanuts.  And I think -- holy shit. I don't  even know my own kids. I mean, who  knows if they're even mine? And it  got me thinking. How much do we  know about kids today? What are  they thinking? How many of them  are allergic to peanuts? Boom. It  hit me -- "My Semester In High  School."
10) 23) dialog: (to Josie) You. What's your name?
10) 25) dialog: You enroll on Friday.
10) 28) dialog: And none of these geezers could  pass for a day under 40. Have fun.
10) 29) text: And Rigfort exits.
118) 0) text: Rigfort presides over a staff meeting. CLOSE UP on stunne office WORKERS' faces.
118) 1) dialog: Alrighty then--next on the agenda- sack races at the company picnic- yes or no?
118) 6) dialog: Miss Geller, what's the status on  your story?
118) 12) dialog: Geller, I don't need your notes. I  need your story. Though I speak  for everyone when I say I've seen  the tapes. Compelling stuff.
118) 14) dialog: But I want a story in two weeks.  I'm saving the "Life and Style"  cover for you. You're gonna make  one hell of a reporter. Oh, and if  you don't, you and Gus are fired.
118) 16) dialog: Now, onto the next order of  business. Marketing department-yes  or no?
171) 0) text: The staff from the Sun Times sits in box seats up front.  Rigfort joins them, carrying a huge load of hot dogs.
171) 1) dialog: I got weiners. Hot weiners.
171) 2) text: Rigfort sits next to Gus. Behind them sit Bruns, his hair finally growing in and Howard, now down to just a sling.
171) 3) dialog: I love this. Sun Times readers,  out here, making a personal  connection to one of our reporters.  This is amazing, isn't it? Weiner?
171) 6) dialog: (studying his weiner) Wait a minute...
171) 7) text: Rigfort pulls something small and shiny out of the bun.
171) 8) dialog: There's a bolt in my weiner.
171) 10) dialog: Hey Howard, what are you doing for  the next month?
