30) 11) dialog: Hi, everyone. (Spots Josie) I don t think we've met. I'm Sam  Coulson- although for some reason  the school has this thing about  not letting you guys call me Sam.

30) 14) dialog: Josie since you're new--I love to  drink my coffee during class, and  since I allow myself to do this, I  allow everyone to bring beverages  to class as well. (a beat) welcome to Shakespeare's "As You  Like It." (beat) Okay. How many of you actually  read the assignment last night?

30) 22) dialog: 'As You Like It" is an example of  a Shakespearean--
30) 23) text: Sam turns to the blackboard and starts writing. We CU on  his butt, hardly discernable in his loose 501 jeans, all  the girls swoon.
30) 24) dialog: Pastoral Comedy. Anyone know what  that means?
30) 27) dialog: That's pasteurize, Sera. But close.  Same letter-- (tapping three  fingers on his arm  a la charades) --three syllables--
30) 31) dialog: Okay, anyone else---
30) 34) text: Student bleets like a sheep O.S. Sam just stares at her,  smiling. Finally, he walks over and shakes her hand.

46) 14) dialog: But it's okay, because you're in  uniform. Disguise changes the rules (beat) I had these Spiderman pyjamas. I  thought when I wore them, that I  had super powers. One night I tried  to walk up the side of the garage.

64) 9) dialog: So what are you thinking for  college?
64) 11) dialog: That's crazy. I'll get you some  applications.
64) 13) dialog: Josie you owe it to yourself to  go. For your writing. You're a  natural.
64) 15) dialog: Josie, you're different. When you  speak in class, I can tell--You  actually feel the words-- (touching heart) in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora  Welty talked about the word it  moon"? How for her it was like a  Concord grape. "That Grandpa took  off his vine and gave to me to  suck out of its skin--"

97) 15) text: They start a slow ascent. Sam seems ill at ease.
97) 17) dialog: I'm gonna tell you something here,  and I hope it doesn't undermine my  position as an authority figure.  I'm a little afraid of heights.
97) 19) dialog: Actually, it's more the plunging  head first into the crowd part  that gets me.
97) 21) dialog: (touched) You remember that story?
97) 23) text: They smile at each other. The smile is interrupted by a  HEAVY SWAYING of their bucket, caused by Tommy ROCKING in the bucket ahead. Sam looks a little green.
97) 24) dialog: Yoooooow.
97) 27) dialog: Out of my control. (yelling to Tommy) TOMMY! CUT IT OUT! ENOUGH!
97) 28) text: Tommy stops. Sam turns to Josie.
97) 29) dialog: (defensive) I said that as a chaperone.
97) 30) text: They start to ascend again. Sam relaxes.
97) 31) dialog: Okay This is okay. Smooth. (then) Can I ask you something? Do you  think I tell too many stories in  class?
97) 33) dialog: God, I would love to think I'm an  interesting teacher. I mean, I had  maybe one or two teachers in high  school who had any passion at all.

97) 39) text: Josie and Sam laugh uncomfortably.
97) 40) dialog: Boys.
97) 42) dialog: I'd like to tell you that we all  grow out of it, but that's a lie.  Some of us will always be rattling  cages.
97) 44) dialog: I don't know. And you know what's  scary--when you get older it just  gets more confusing. I've spent  the last ten years with women who  are basically all wrong for me. (beat) You know what, I shouldn't be  talking about this stuff with you.
97) 46) text: The bucket is rocked again by Tommy--Sam grips the safety bar.
97) 47) dialog: (as he rocks) Same here.
97) 49) dialog: All I can tell you is that when  you're my age, the guys will be  lined up around the block for you.
97) 52) dialog: I shouldn't say that, because I'm  your teacher.
97) 53) text: They look at each other, their smiles fading into  realization. Suddenly, the car jerks, and they start to  move down. Josie and Sam are pulled out of their reverie. They smile awkwardly at each other and laugh a small laug WIDE SHOT of the Ferris wheel as Josie and Sam descend.
97) 54) dialog: Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad  as I thought.
97) 56) dialog: I'm thinking when I'm home.
