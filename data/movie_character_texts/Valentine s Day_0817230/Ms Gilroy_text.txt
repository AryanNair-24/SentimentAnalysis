25) 1) dialog: Remember girls, registration for the AP exam must be in by next week, so don’t flake. Promise me. This class is way too hard to take just for fun. The BELL RINGS and the girls swiftly pack up their things begin to head out. Ms. Gilroy stops Janice as she leaves. MS. GILROY (CONT’D) That last comment wasn’t directed at you. I just realized it could have sounded that way.
25) 3) dialog: OK. Even though, since you’ve already taken the AP test, you are kind of taking this class for fun.
25) 5) dialog: Right. Anyway, I’m putting together a little study group for the girls and I was wondering if I could pick your brain at some point about what I should focus on. You know, since you’ve recently taken the test. And I - never did.
25) 7) dialog: Great. How about today after school?
25) 9) dialog: OK. Tomorrow morning?
25) 11) dialog: I‘1l consider that. I’m guessing evenings are out of the question?
25) 13) dialog: Alright then. Wow you’re busy. How about today at lunch? Janice smiles.
25) 15) dialog: Umm. OK. Uh - 32. 2/18/9 33.
25) 18) dialog: (wanting this to end) Great!
