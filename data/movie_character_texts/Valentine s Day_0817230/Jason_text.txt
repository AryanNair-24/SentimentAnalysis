7) 1) dialog: Hello. Liz smiles shyly at him. 2/18/9 12.
7) 3) dialog: I’m used to seeing you every morning -- but not exactly like this. She laughs.
7) 5) dialog: As a matter of fact, I would. I don’t think that would be breaking any kind of office regulations. He puts his arms around her, and they start to kiss passionately.
7) 7) dialog: How is it possible that we didn’t start hanging out until three weeks ago?

21) 5) dialog: Wait - what?
21) 7) dialog: No - wait - it’s Valentine’s Day? But it’s Monday. I thought it was always on a Thursday. 2/18/9 28.

34) 7) dialog: Here. You wanna call her? Maybe she'll tell you about the time I got trapped in a volleyball net -- She cracks a smile. He’s clearly trying.

50) 4) dialog: I’m not really sure. The CLERK is really trying to understand.
50) 5) dialog: I have no idea what I’m doing. I’ve been going out with this girl for like two and a half weeks. But then today I was getting a little bit of a brush-offy vibe. (MORE )
50) 7) dialog: And I say going out, but if you want to get really technical about it, we've never actually said we were going out - so it may still just be in the hanging out category. We've slept together once- and I realize I’m oversharing - but I guess that might not really mean anything. And then we work together, so that’s another wrinkle. The clerk takes this in.
50) 12) dialog: Okay... The clerk reaches into the case again -

66) 3) dialog: I thought if we got here at 6 it would be pretty empty. A WAITRESS approaches.
66) 5) dialog: I don’t know, eternal love sounds kinda nice... Liz checks her watch.
66) 7) dialog: (to waitress) Maybe you have like a one course ‘just dating’ menu? The waitress doesn’t laugh.
66) 8) dialog: I think we need some more time. Jason takes a sip of his water, tries to relax.
66) 10) dialog: Sorry. My bad. They really pack us in there, huh? The DUDE glares and slides his water closer. Jason looks Liz, forces a smile, checks out his menu.
66) 11) dialog: I heard the steaks are great here.
66) 13) dialog: Are you sure?
66) 15) dialog: I didn’t realize you had other plans -
66) 17) dialog: No. It’s cool. I actually have some other plans, too. An awkward beat. Then, Jason reaches into his pocket.
66) 18) dialog: But I did get you something. And I'd really like for you to have it. He pulls out a SMALL WRAPPED BOX. He hands it to her, expectant.
66) 20) dialog: It’s for business cards. For when you get promoted. I thought it was the perfect gift - you know - co- worker to co-worker. Liz looks a little sad.

78) 0) text: Both Edgar and Jason are a little inebriated now. The fil playing in the background.
78) 2) dialog: She said she had to go back to work. But that’s probably bullshit - I mean, it’s probably not the truth -
78) 4) dialog: So she’s probably just blowing me off. As Edgar takes this in, he looks up to the screen to see: ON THE SCREEN: A scene with a young 20 something starlet talking to Rock Hudson on the telephone. Edgar smiles, nudges Jason. Gestures to the screen. 2/18/9 100.
