3) 7) dialog: A recently divorced, handsome doctor such as yourself doesn’t know what it’s like to be single. But for us unhitched gals, well, it sucks.

41) 20) dialog: When there’s that much silence, I know you’re thinking up a lie.
41) 22) dialog: Madison. Take all of your Valentines and bring them up here. If you’re good you might get them back at the end of the day. Kara, I’m afraid this goes for you, too.
41) 24) dialog: It’s not nice to play with people's hearts like that. When a cough comes behind Julia:
41) 26) dialog: Reed? What are you doing here? Edison, recognizing Reed, thinks he’s delivering the rose ordered that morning. He stands up, excited. 2/18/9 53.
41) 28) dialog: It’s from Harrison.

42) 13) dialog: What? You said you liked spontaneous.
42) 15) dialog: Look Reed, I get it. You've had six girlfriends since we’ve known each other - you’re always ina relationship. You understand how these things work. My track record - on the other hand - could kindly be referred to as spotty. But this one feels different. So don’t worry. I'll be fine. Now I gotta get back to class. She goes in, shutting the door. Leaving Reed alone, with idea what to do.

56) 26) dialog: I don’t know. I guess - if you love her and she loves you then -
56) 28) dialog: Fine. No. Not really. Don’t see it. Don’t see you two together.
56) 30) dialog: You are unbelievable. You expect me to buy that - that you’re trying to help me? You’re just doing this because - for once - I have something and you have nothing. And you just can’t take it. You want me to feel as bad as you do.
