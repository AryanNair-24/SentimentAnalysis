14) 3) dialog: The future Mrs. Bennett, ladies and gentlemen.
14) 6) dialog: Morley really does not like people making a fuss over her - her -
14) 7) dialog: So I just thought we'd carry her on our shoulders around the store like one time - two times tops - They laugh.
14) 8) dialog: I'm kidding. (handing his apron to a clerk) Can you take over for me for a minute? He ushers Morley into the back.
14) 9) dialog: Nice to see you. Fiance. That word is weird, right? Have you said it yet?

20) 12) dialog: Wow. Things are going well with him, then?
20) 14) dialog: I don’t think so.
20) 16) dialog: No. I love spontaneity. Julia considers this, then smiles.

29) 15) dialog: We do. I just wanted to make sure we're understanding the same understanding.
41) 0) text: Quickly, Reed and Alphonso are transferring all the flora arrangements from Alphonso’s bum van to Reed’s van. Reed upset, thrown off his game.
41) 1) dialog: This is ridiculous. There’s easily several hundred dollars worth of damage here. We're already behind on our delivery schedule. And then I find out that Julia’s boyfriend is married. I mean, what am I supposed to do with that? I shouldn't tell her, right? Who wants to hear that? (he looks at Alphonso, hopeful) I should probably just stay out of it, right? Alphonso grimaces.

42) 0) text: Reed looks at Julia, trying to find the words. But Julia’ got plenty of her own.
42) 3) dialog: I was. I mean...I don’t know. I met Harrison when he came in and placed the order.
42) 5) dialog: (haltingly) Sure, sure. But, you know, people are so - complex, right? And there’s always more to the story --
42) 9) dialog: Oh, yeah. I remember now. They must still be on the truck, little man. Don’t worry, they’1ll get here soon.
42) 12) dialog: Don’t get on that plane today. It’s a mistake. Julia stops. 2/18/9 55.

44) 11) dialog: Be right back.
44) 13) dialog: Hello? 2/18/9 58. Nothing. As he starts toward the kitchen, he hears from upstairs:
45) 1) dialog: Hey.
45) 3) dialog: What are you doing home? Morley doesn’t say anything. As he starts to approach her he sees the CLOSET DOOR IS OPEN. AND THE CLOSET IS EMPTY. He stops. He looks at Morley. Then to her packed suitcase on the floor. It’s all starting to make sense.
45) 5) dialog: It’s not the ring. It’s me. She looks at him, and though it appears to pain her, she doesn’t argue.
45) 7) text: MORLEY (cont'd) No one prepares girls for how to handle that scenario. They prepare us to say yes, not how to gracefully say no. Reed is clearly trying to remain upbeat.
45) 8) dialog: Look, it’s fine. If you’re not ready, that’s OK. We can take the whole marriage thing off the table. Maybe I shouldn’t have surprised you like that - we’ve only been together a year - maybe we should have talked about it -- She stops him.
45) 10) dialog: Did you even consider marrying me? Even for a minute?
46) 0) text: Reed gets back into the van, still holding the black box. Alphonso looks at him. He’s clearly upset. They sit there for a long, quiet moment. 2/18/9 60.

46) 3) dialog: You knew?
46) 5) dialog: What feeling?
46) 7) dialog: An inkling? Why didn’t you say something?
46) 9) dialog: But I do.

46) 13) dialog: I’ve gotta stop her.
46) 15) dialog: Wait - I thought we were behind?

51) 2) dialog: Shit. Straight to voicemail again. Reed shoots Alphonso a look, steps harder on the gas.
56) 0) text: Reed runs into the United Terminal. Looks up at the departing monitors. Finds Julia’s 4:15 flight. Gate 82. Reed runs through the terminal, squeezing past irritated passengers until he’s stopped short.
56) 3) dialog: I need a ticket on any flight that leaves from Gate C. Preferably your cheapest.
56) 5) dialog: But you can sell me a ticket, right? If you wanted to.
56) 7) dialog: Look, I know what this seems like. I’m just some other shlemiel who cheated on his girlfriend, and now he’s here with his sob story, begging you to let him go chase the girl down and tell her how it was all a big misunderstanding and that the email with all the naked pictures was actually just a gag by one of his fraternity buddies. The ticket agent looks vaguely disturbed.
56) 9) dialog: Right? So let me tell you my story. The girl I’m running to catch isn’t even my girlfriend. But I have to tell her that her boyfriend - they guy she’s about to get on a plane and surprise - is married. And it’s a crappy thing to hear. But I have to do it because it’s the right thing to do. Because she’s a great girl and she'd even take a cigar band from a guy - and I know I’m getting a little off track here, but my point is - I have to go get her. Compared to the earlier story, the ticket agent likes thi one. He starts punching the keys of his computer.

56) 15) dialog: He’s married.
56) 17) dialog: Your boyfriend. Harrison.
56) 19) dialog: No, Julia. He lives in Malibu with his wife, Alexandra. He came into Rita Flora today and sent you both red roses.
56) 23) dialog: Do you think Morley and I belong together?
56) 25) dialog: It just - does. Do you? 2/18/9 73.
56) 27) dialog: You’re not answering the question. Honestly - as my friend -
56) 29) dialog: Well that’s why I’m doing this. Because apparently everyone and their mother knew I shouldn’t propose to her, but no one had the guts to say anything - and now she’s gone and I’m left with this stupid ring and an empty closet and I don’t want you to make the same mistake I did. Don’t pursue a dead end Julia. It hurts like hell. Julia stares at him, trying to process this. She’s not having it.

64) 3) dialog: So, surprise her. Someone around here should have a happy Valentine’s day. Alphonso looks at him a moment, and nods.
64) 5) dialog: I did everything I could to stop her. 2/18/9 86.
64) 7) dialog: And how do you know that? Another inkling.
64) 9) dialog: Go. Be with your family. He pats Reed on the shoulder, gets out of the car. Walks the path to his front door.
76) 0) text: It’s still busy, mostly men rushing in before they drive home. Reed walks in, still clinging to his BLACK BOX. Not the upbeat Reed we’re used to. He watches as his clerks m quickly and efficiently. Edison enters, exhausted from his walk. He’s so out of breath he can barely talk. But he trudges right up to Ree who can’t believe his eyes.
76) 2) dialog: Where to? Edison looks at Reed. His face lights up.
80) 0) text: The van pulls up, Reed and Edison hop out. As Reed goes t the back to grab the flower, Janice’s car pulls up. She jumps out and makes a bee-line for Edison, who starts apologizing before she can even talk.
80) 6) dialog: Everything OK? Edison looks to Janice, hopeful. She softens.
80) 12) dialog: Anytime. Edison walks to the front of the restaurant and enters. Janice walks back to her car. But Reed just stands there, not sure what to do. Instead of going to his van, he head toward the front door of the restaurant.

85) 9) dialog: So. You're here.
85) 11) dialog: You are not a loser. You just - deserve better. Julia smiles, a bit taken aback by the compliment.
85) 12) dialog: So why didn’t you go? 2/18/9 115.
85) 14) dialog: And now that I have nothing? Julia stands her ground, matches his smile.
89) 0) text: From outside, we can see into the lit up cafe side of the store. It’s empty except for one table - Reed and Julia s across from each other, talking. As they laugh, completely at ease with each other, the ca moves up, looking down 6th street, downtown LA coming int view. We then tilt up to the night sky, stopping at the bright white moon, which looks like a heart. Not really. It just looks like the moon. The end.
