9) 18) dialog: What you know about it you-- You bring that six-pack man?
9) 31) dialog: (shrugs ) It’s a white boy who’s been to law school and he got them degrees. I ain’t got to tell you what that means: it don’t mean shit. 22.
9) 33) dialog: I'm hip, and it’s a mighty welcome change. (pause) Like I was saying, it don’t mean shit and I ain’t sure we’re going to stay with him. On the other hand, as white boys go, he’s not so bad: he’s young and hungry, so he’s not as full of shit now as he may be when he’s full.
9) 37) dialog: I don't know how God expects a man to act when his son is in a cage. Your God crucified His son and was probably glad to get rid of him, but I ain't like that. I ain't hardly going out in the street and kiss the first white cop I see. But I'll be a very loving motherfucker the day my son walks out of that hellhole, free. Oh, I'll be full of love, that day.

11) 15) dialog: You can bet that it won’t be the Holy damn Ghost. Mrs. Hunt shooting Frank a look of disgust, then rising, begins slowly crossing the room:
11) 19) dialog: I think you’ll find it’s still pumping. But I wouldn’t call it no heart. Frank does not look remorseful, more sad than anything, s over everything.
11) 20) dialog: Joe, let the women take care of her and come on with me. Joe hesitating, still shocked by the violence:

We take the place in as Tish does: a small, low room, but a fireplace. Just off the room is a tiny kitchenette and bathroom. There’s a wooden stool and a couple of hassocks a large wooden table and a smaller one. On the small table, a few empty beer cans and on the larg one, tools. The room smells of wood; there’s raw wood everywhere. In the far corner, a mattress on the floor covered with a Mexican shawl. Fonny's pencil sketches are pinned on the wall. The only other item: a photograph of Frank. 31. “We were to spend a lifetime in this room." Fonny standing across the room from Tish. She’s watching they both know she’s watching him.

26) 12) dialog: That’s easy to say.
26) 14) dialog: I guess... I love Fonny more than I love anybody in this world. And it makes me ashamed, man, I swear, because he was a real manly little boy, wasn't scared of nothing, except maybe his Mama. He didn't understand his Mama. And I don't know what I should’ve done. I ain't a woman. And there's some things only a woman can do with a child. Frank sips his drink, tries to smile.
26) 15) dialog: I don't know if I was ever any kind of father to him — any kind of real father — and now he's in jail and it ain't his fault and I don't even know how I'm going to get him out. I'm sure one hell of a man.

But I know it I know it.” CUT TO BLACK. And OVER BLACK, a new SOUND rising, like the city through window, distant and present at once. “I remember the night the baby was conceived. It was the day we found our loft.”
