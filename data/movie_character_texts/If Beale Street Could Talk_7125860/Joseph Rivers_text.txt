6) 20) dialog: Shit. What's a lawyer for? 11.
6) 22) dialog: You got that right.
6) 26) dialog: Shit. We got to work it out. Fonny's like one of us.
6) 35) dialog: What you doin’ with that?
6) 38) dialog: (faux accent) But of course, Madame. Joe setting a nice enough snifter before each of them, go around the table in turns and pours a little brandy into each. As he bends to pour Tish’s...
6) 40) dialog: Alright, what’s the deal? Sharon looking to Joe, then at Ernestine, then at Tish. S smiles at Tish:
6) 43) dialog: That's a hell of a note. Joe takes a sip of his brandy, a good, deep swallow:
6) 44) dialog: Ain't you going to drink to the little one, Tish? 14. Tish nodding, takes the lightest sip of that brandy, stil rouses a cough in her, Ernestine patting her on the back.
6) 45) dialog: How long this been going on?
6) 48) dialog: Three months! ?
6) 50) dialog: While you two was running around looking at places? Joe asking this question as much to himself as to anyone else. The women understanding, allowing that question the proper space to drift out, refract. After a moment, after a few more long sips:
6) 51) dialog: You sure you want this baby?
6) 54) dialog: Don't you go thinking I think you a bad girl, or any foolishness like that. I just asked you that because you so young, that's all, and-- 15.
6) 57) dialog: I hope it’s a boy, that’d tickle old Frank to pieces, I bet. (a thought grabbing him) Tish, do you mind... if I break the news to him?
6) 61) dialog: You know you right love, let’s get them over here. Joe turning down that long hall adjoining the bedrooms. A his footfalls pad away, we stay here, with these women listening to Joe on the phone down that hall. Beat. Joe coming back down that hallway now, re-enters the livi room, takes a seat at the one recliner in here:
6) 62) dialog: Mrs. Hunt... is getting dressed. (smiles at Tish) Come on over here, daughter. Tish rising from her spot on the couch, moves from mother father, sits beside Joe, head rested to his shoulder: 16.
6) 63) dialog: You're a good girl, Tish. I’m proud of you. Don’t you forget that.
6) 67) dialog: Look. We got to be nice, okay?
6) 69) dialog: I didn’t run no tailor shop.
9) 18) dialog: What you know about it you-- You bring that six-pack man?
9) 19) dialog: Or I got some gin and we got whiskey and we got some brandy. Ain’t got no Thunderbird though-- (and, to Mrs. Hunt) I’m sure you ladies won’t mind?
14) 24) dialog: (measured) I'd like you to tell me exactly what you mean young lady by walking in here this hour of the morning. If you want to leave home, then you leave home, you hear? But as long as you in my house, you got to respect it. You hear me? 40. Joe's gaze shifting to Fonny. Fonny immediately releasing Tish’s hand, takes a deep breath:
14) 26) dialog: How old are you?
14) 28) dialog: You think that’s old enough to get married?
14) 30) dialog: You think so?
14) 32) dialog: How you going to feed her?
14) 34) dialog: You got a job?
14) 36) dialog: Now, let me get this straight. You asked my little girl to marry you, and she said--
14) 38) dialog: And you come here to tell me or to ask my permission?
14) 40) dialog: What would you do in my place?
14) 42) dialog: (at Tish) You love him, Tish?
26) 2) dialog: Well, the first thing we got to do is to stop blaming ourselves. If we can't do that, man, we'll never get the boy out because we'll be so fucked up. And we cannot fuck up now, baby, and I know you hear where I'm coming from.
26) 4) dialog: You ever have any money? Frank looks up at him and says nothing, merely questions with his eyes.
26) 5) dialog: You ever have any money?
26) 7) dialog: Then why you worried about it now? Frank looks up at him again.
26) 8) dialog: You raised them somehow. You fed them somehow, didn't you? If we start to worrying about money now, man, we going to be fucked and we going to lose our children. That white man, baby, he want you to be worried about the money. That's his whole game. But if we got to where we are without money, we can get further. 66.
26) 9) dialog: I ain't worried about they money -- they ain't got no right to it anyhow, they stole it from us -- they ain't never met nobody they didn't lie to and steal from. Well, I can steal, too. And rob. How you think I raised my daughters? Shit. But Frank is not Joseph. He stares down again, into his drink.
26) 11) dialog: What we make happen!
26) 13) dialog: Not if you mean it. There is a long silence into which neither man speaks. Ev the jukebox is silent.
26) 16) dialog: Well, he sure think you are. He loves you, and he respects you; now you got to remember that I might know that better than you. 67.
26) 17) dialog: Tell you something else: your son is the father of my daughter's baby. Now, how you going to sit here and act like can't nothing be done? We got a child on the way here, man. You want me to beat the shit out of you? He says this with ferocity but, after a moment, smiles.
26) 18) dialog: Now I know some hustles and you know some hustles and these are our children and we got to set them free. So, let's drink up man and go on in.
