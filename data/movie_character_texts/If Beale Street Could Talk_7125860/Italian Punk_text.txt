34) 2) dialog: Hey, sweet tomato. You know I dig tomatoes. 72. And now people are watching. Tish searching them, looking help but people only stare, no one moves. Tish goes to move past him, leaves the tomatoes there but boy grabs her arm. Instinctively, she slaps him — BAP! — spits in his face. And at this moment, Fonny enters the store, grabs the boy the hair, knocks him to the ground and kicks him somethin fierce. Takes him by the lapel and drags him out onto the sidewalk, tosses him in the gutter. Tish screaming and, at first, we’re not sure why, Tish grabbing a hold of Fonny and, oddly, turning her back to Fonny’s chest, reaches behind her and pulls him close to his chin at the crown of her head. And then we see him: a uniformed officer hurrying across intersection, eyes flaring, billy-club at the ready. As he nears, we recognize him: this is the aforementioned blue-eyed officer from Tish’s remembrances, OFFICER BELL. Tish holding the back of her head against Fonny's chest, his wrists clutched in her two hands.
