Brown is about 40, with a countenance indicating shrewdness and intelligence. Hamilton is closer to 25, a man of fair complexion and light eyes. Both are finely, if perhaps a bit garishly, dressed. Hamilton, as Solomon describes him, slightly effeminate. Moon, spotting Solomon:

10) 12) dialog: Taking into consideration his graciousness and your modesty, may we trouble you for a moment of your time to converse, sir?

11) 3) dialog: Circus too constricting a word to describe the talented and merry band with which we travel. It is a spectacle unlike most have ever witnessed. Creatures from the darkest Africa as yet unseen by civilized man. Acrobats from the Orient able to contort themselves in the most confounding manners.
11) 5) dialog: We are on our way thither to rejoin the company having left for a short time to make a small profit from our own exhibitions.
11) 7) dialog: Yes. We had just a devil of a time in procuring music for our

11) 18) dialog: If we could persuade you to accompany us as far as New York... We would give you one dollar for each day's service and three dollars for every night played at our performances. In addition we would provide sufficient pay for the expenses of your return from New York here to Saratoga.

16) 2) dialog: And not satisfied a bit despite giving them more than what they paid for.
16) 5) dialog: The opportunity is with the circus. A two man show poorly promoted, what were we to expect? But the circus bills itself.
16) 7) dialog: I have told you of the circus with which we are connected. Creatures from the darkest of Africa. Acrobats from the Orient who--
16) 9) dialog: Yes. We need to return immediately to Washington. Solomon...I believe us familiar enough now, but forgive me if I am bold...would you consider making the trip with us? Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea.
16) 17) dialog: Hear, hear.
16) 19) dialog: Said as fellow artists as well as businessmen. Well worth the effort at least.
16) 23) dialog: There is a practical concern. If you are to continue on with us you should obtain your free papers.
16) 25) dialog: Here in New York, no. But we will be entering slave states and as a matter of precaution... It's to all our benefit we should not have to come to account for your well being.
16) 33) dialog: We'll go to the Customs House in the morning, then travel on. Good business all around. 13.

18) 1) dialog: Forty-three dollars. All to you.
18) 3) dialog: Consider the remainder an advance from the circus. I cannot tell you...I honestly wish you had seen the expression of our director when I described your abilities. He was fairly overcome with excitement.
18) 5) dialog: I did. I did, but so many preparations before the company is to depart.
18) 8) dialog: Tomorrow we shall prepare for our Washington debut. But tonight, our thoughts are with the great man
18) 12) dialog: for whom this city prepared solemn memorial. He has passed from the praise of men to receive the plaudit of his heavenly father. A fine man has passed. Let us remember him with a drink.

The corn meal is mixed with a little water, placed in the fire and baked. When it is "done brown" the ashes are scraped off. Bacon is fried. As the slaves eat, Abram goes on in great length and with much emotion about General Jackson.
