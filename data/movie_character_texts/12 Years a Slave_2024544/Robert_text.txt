A chain of slaves  enter the frame and are led one by one on to the docked  vessel.  MORE SLAVES - about 15 in all, of various genders and  ages - are brought on board. Chief among them is ROBERT  who fights viciously with his captors. "With all haste"  is shoved down into the hold.  Having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to,  Burch and Radburn depart. They do so without a word  spoken to Solomon or the others.  With this new and sizable batch of slaves on board, the  crew again CASTS OFF, and the Orleans makes its way  again.

Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the  hold.  As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand between Eliza and the Sailor. Stretching out a firm hand  to the sailor's shoulder, Robert's look says "No you  don't."  Clemens Ray is awake now, watching.  There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor  and Robert, an impasse.  We focus on the Sailor's face. Slowly, a greasy smile  erupts upon it. Back now to Robert's face, a look of  incomprehension.  Robert looks down. We follow his gaze to the knife that  has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs.  The sailor withdraws the bloody blade.  A wide shot of the two men. Robert collapses to the  floor like a sack of potatoes.  Clemens Ray and Solomon react. Complete horror.
