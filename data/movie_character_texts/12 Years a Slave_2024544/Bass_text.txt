139) 0) text: As the slaves continue to work, there is a conversation going on between Epps and Bass. Bass much skilled in the art of sophistry, while Epps's arguments are fueled mostly by emotion alone. Though at first Epps does little more than joke his way around the facts. Solomon, working still, can't help but overhear as Epps offers Bass a drink, which Bass waves away.
139) 2) dialog: I'm well.
139) 15) dialog: Your humor is inadvertent. Sensing perhaps Bass's laughter might be at his expense, Epps presses.
139) 17) dialog: I'm here to complete the work at hand. As requested, and as paid.
139) 19) dialog: You ask plainly, I will tell you plainly. What I find amusing: You worry about my well being in the heat but, quite frankly, the condition of your laborers--
139) 21) dialog: It is horrid. It's all wrong. All wrong, sir.
139) 23) dialog: You say that with pride.
139) 25) dialog: If the conversation concerns what is factual and what is not; there's no justice nor righteousness in slavery. I wouldn't own a slave if I was rich as Croesus, which I am not, as is perfectly well understood. More particularly among my creditors. There's another humbug: the credit system. Humbug, sir. No credit, no debt. Credit leads a man into temptation. Cash down is the only thing that will deliver him from
139) 30) dialog: evil. But this question of slavery; what right have you to your niggers when you come down to the point?
139) 32) dialog: Of course you did. The law says you have the right to hold a nigger, but begging the law's pardon...it lies. Is everything right because the law allows it? Suppose they'd pass a law taking away your liberty and making you a slave?
139) 34) dialog: Suppose.
139) 36) dialog: Because the law states that your liberties are undeniable? Because society deems it so? Laws change. Social systems crumble. Universal truths are constant. It is a fact, it is a plain fact that what is true and right is true and right for all. White and black alike.
139) 38) dialog: Look here; you can't laugh me down in that way. These niggers are human beings. If they are allowed to scale no higher than brute animals, you and men like you will have to answer for it. There's an
139) 45) dialog: A fearful ill, resting on this
139) 48) dialog: That will not go unpunished forever. There will be a reckoning yet.
143) 4) dialog: No part of this land. I was born in Canada. Now guess where that is.
143) 6) dialog: Have you?
143) 8) dialog: Well traveled for a slave. How came you here?
143) 10) dialog: How's this? Tell me all about it.
143) 12) dialog: Every word you speak is a profound secret.
144) 0) text: Hours have passed. Bass reflects on the story that Epps has told in the intervening.
144) 1) dialog: How many years all told?
144) 3) dialog: Your story is...it is amazing, and in no good way.
144) 5) dialog: I do.
144) 7) dialog: I believe so.
144) 15) dialog: I have always forgone relationships and family. I did once have a sweetheart who I loved deeply. Bass points to a measuring tool, which Solomon immediately hands over.
144) 16) dialog: But that was a long, long time ago. I've been traveling this country for the best part of twenty years. My freedom is everything. The fact that I can walk out of here tomorrow gives me most pleasure. I see the aching in your eyes, the pain of not being attached to your loved ones. My life doesn't mean much to anyone, but it seems your life means a lot to a lot of people. What you have just said to me scares me, and I must say, sir, I am afraid. Not just for you, but for me. They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison. Solomon, slightly confused.
144) 17) dialog: I will write your letter sir, for if I could bring freedom to you, it will be more than a pleasure. It will be a duty. Now, would you be so kind as to pass me those nails, sir. We pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the unfinished structure. They continue to work, as if the conversation had never occurred.
146) 3) dialog: And bring those markers! Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and approaches Bass.
146) 4) dialog: No letter yet.
146) 6) dialog: I have inquired thoroughly. More than is safe for either of us. Bass takes another and pokes it into the ground, improvising a pathway towards the gazebo.
146) 7) dialog: Solomon...I have a job or two on hand which will be completed shortly... The work here has grown sparse.
146) 15) dialog: You must know, wherever I am I will press your cause.
146) 17) dialog: If there is any chance...
146) 19) dialog: I will continue to write your
