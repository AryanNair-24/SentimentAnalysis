Wealthy young IRANIANS sit at a table littered with ice- buckets and bottles of Absolut and Johnnie Walker. And with them is BOB BAER, 40's, professionally nondescript, he could be anything, a salesman, a high- school teacher. His face is ever-changing and his eyes miss nothing. Bob is the only American in the place and still you almost wouldn't notice him. ARASH AMIRI, 20's, a confident young Iranian, yells over the music. Beside him is his BROTHER.

Inside: A STINGER MISSILE, neatly disassembled. He finds the serial number: 3j16w4921. A SMILEY FACE is scratched into the metal of the Stinger. Bob tries to activate the Stinger. It's dead. Arash and his brother perspire. Bob is perspiring. Bob thinks he hears faint MOUTH BREATHING from behind the curtain closing off the rear of the shop. Bob opens HIS ATTACHE CASE. He removes a pouch. The pouch holds a battery. The battery has a serial number. Bob finds: 3j16w4921. A perfect match. He removes the dead battery and replaces it with the live battery. He activates the missile. It works. Everyone is relieved. (CONTINUED)     3 5 CONTINUED: 5
5) 1) text: Bob moves to THE NEXT MILITARY CASE. He replaces the next battery and activates the second missile. Arash and his brother share a celebratory glance. Arash suddenly takes ONE CASE and drags it through the curtain. Bob hears LOW VOICES. He turns questioningly to Arash's brother who just stares and smiles like an idiot. Then Arash reappears, passing by Bob. BOB
5) 2) text: You said they were both for you. Arash tosses an envelope at Bob -- ARASH AMIRI
5) 3) text: What do you care? Bob glances in the envelope. Behind him, the Amiris are picking up the other case. Bob moves toward the curtain. IN THE BACK OF THE SHOP Bob's eyes adjust. Several robed shapes, ghosts in grey light, carry the case out a door. The BARREL OF A GUN touches the side of Bob's head. The SOUND of a SHELL CHAMBERED and a MOUTH BREATHER. Bob raises his hands. The barrel slides around to his forehead and Bob is staring into the blue eyes of MOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA, 40's, bearded, and calm. BOB (FARSI)

ROBBY BAER, 16, concentrates, hits hyper space, smiles, remembers he has a retainer, hides his smile. He glances over at a cafe table where Bob and MARGARET BAER, 40's, frank and guarded in a way that is compelling, are having morning coffee. We realize that all around them are IRANIANS, that a crowd is massing in the street outside, and that Bob clearly doesn't want to have this conversation. MARGARET

Failed states and failed economies, but Iran is a natural cultural ally of the U.S. The Persians do not want to roll back the clock to the 8th century. I see students marching in the streets. I hear Khatami making the right sounds. And what I'd like to know is if we keep embargoing them on energy, then someday soon are we going to get a nice, secular, pro-Western, pro-business government?
