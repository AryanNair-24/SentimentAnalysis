0) 21) dialog: Oh, did that what's-his-name, the strange bald lawyer call?
0) 23) dialog: How about Douglas вЂ” did he reconfirm for this afternoon?
0) 25) dialog: If he ever does call me here, it's fine to give the number for the car вЂ” the lawyer. He represents Merkey, the artist I'm showing next month. Douglas already has the number. Which must mean he's still coming вЂ” if he didn't call.

0) 38) dialog: And you'd like to go home now. Dee Dee nods sheepishly.
0) 39) dialog: Go. Dee Dee crosses slowly to the staircase.
0) 43) dialog: No doubt.
0) 45) dialog: And you told him yes, I hope. Dee Dee nods.
0) 46) dialog: You're a good little wife, Dee Dee. Every woman should have one. Taking this as a compliment, she smiles and disappears. After a moment, the front door opens and closes. After a moment more, Nina rises with wine glass in hand and goes the BACK DOOR. She gazes pensively through the glass, perhaps watching Dee Dee go, perhaps not.

0) 83) dialog: To tell me what?
0) 85) dialog: Douglas?
0) 90) dialog: We're usually this way. She extends a hand, indicating the end of the hallway is their intended direction of travel. With a bemused shake of the head, Nina closes the front door and follows.

0) 99) dialog: Douglas.
0) 101) dialog: "The Sun Also Rises."
0) 103) dialog: You see, I'm really very ... accustomed to him вЂ” Douglas. Fitch nods a small, noncommittal nod.

0) 147) dialog: I never really gave it much thought.
0) 149) dialog: Massage вЂ” in those terms. I try not to intellectualize things too much. It makes life so grey. I'm more ... intuitive, I think. She watches as Fitch again immerses himself in his ritual then:
0) 150) dialog: How old are you?
0) 152) dialog: I don't know, why not ask? I mean, you never learn anything without asking, do you?
0) 161) dialog: If it never happened, it was too recent. I don't like doctors вЂ” mine or anyone else's.
0) 163) dialog: I don't like doctors because ... I don't like doctors. A beat, then: (CONTINUED)
0) 166) dialog: You've known Doug for how long? Fitch shrugs: Doug is a topic of conversation that he can either take or leave. And right now he feels more like leaving it than taking it.
0) 167) dialog: Long enough to like him?
0) 169) dialog: What's that?
0) 171) dialog: Socrates did not.
0) 173) dialog: Well, it's not like you have to have a degree in molecular biology to see a connection. Massage is sexual. Very sexual.
0) 177) dialog: I wasn't talking about sweating, screaming, orgasmic epiphany. It's just that you're lying there naked, someone's touching you in places you sure wouldn't let your father touch you, and it's ... arousing.
0) 179) dialog: Looks like we're ready to start.
0) 181) dialog: What do you mean? Fitch reaches for his massage "tool bag" and begins removing items.
0) 187) dialog: I'll find something. She crosses out of the room. her. After a moment, he follows
1) 11) dialog: The part that begins at my hair and ends at my toes. From his bag, he removes an impressive assortment of bottles and jars. He selects one then begins applying oil in long, slow, sweeping strokes until the whole of her ba is slick and glistening.
1) 15) dialog: (o.s.) It's my job, you know....
1) 19) dialog: You were going to say something about how tense I am.... Maybe he was. More likely he was undergoing some out-ofbo of her back that he massages.
1) 20) dialog: Douglas always does. He's always telling me how much tension I have. Especially in my upper back, my shoulders. It's all because of my work.... A beat of expectation, as she waits for him to question h about her work. Then, when he does not, when he simply continues massaging her in intense silence, she answers anyway:
1) 21) dialog: I own a gallery. A couple of them, actually. One here in town, off Melrose. Another in New York, Tribeca. And when it's your business, your baby вЂ” well, you know what they say about responsibility falling on your shoulders. It does вЂ” literally. A beat, then:
1) 23) dialog: Was I? talking too much?
1) 27) dialog: The people I work with limit their relaxation to what they can purchase in a vial. After he performs a series of long, deep strokes, she visibly loosens up. She seems to be taking his advice. Half-joking, he lifts one of her feet and lets it drop to the table.
1) 34) dialog: How long have you been doing massage, Fitch?
1) 36) dialog: Interesting work. I'm sure you meet all kinds of people. Gives you a lot (MORE) (CONTINUED)
1) 39) dialog: I travel a lot вЂ” in my work. Too much, I'm starting to think. I guess it just depends how badly you want what you want... Another brief beat, then:
1) 40) dialog: Do you like art? You seem like the sort of person who does.
1) 42) dialog: Well, an ... (catching herself) What do you mean?
1) 44) dialog: Well, do you? enjoy art?
1) 46) dialog: How do you mean?
1) 48) dialog: I'm really not in that business. (CONTINUED)
1) 52) dialog: - I don't think you can quantify artistic achievement FITCH - or would you say Braque? or Klee?
1) 53) dialog: What's your point, Fitch? Instead of replying, Fitch retreats for a moment, again massaging her in silence. His strokes now become a tease although from all appearances an inadvertent one вЂ” as h hands move nearer and nearer her ass. Finally, in a series of deep, slow strokes, he slips his hands under the towel and withdraws them, then slips them under again вЂ” to which she visibly succumbs. Her eyelid close heavily.
1) 57) dialog: 58 on the table as she sighs deeply.
1) 60) dialog: What was it you were going to say? No response.
1) 61) dialog: You were going to say something and then you just stopped. (CONTINUED)
1) 66) dialog: Oh, I disagree. Modern art is critical. That's what makes it modern.
1) 69) dialog: Where do you show? The painter laughs.
1) 71) dialog: What are those?

2) 1) dialog: You really must visit my gallery. We've got a very interesting installation coming up next month I think you should see.
2) 3) dialog: A history of women's fashion as a form of bondage. Fitch cocks an amused eyebrow.
2) 4) dialog: Come and see it. I think you'll enjoy it. It has a certain point of view. It's funny. Ironic. Satiric.
2) 6) dialog: Exactly. (CONTINUED)
2) 10) dialog: I'm sure people have said something like as long as there have been people to say it.
2) 12) dialog: I'm sure they said that, too.
2) 14) dialog: (v.o.) If you're talking about today вЂ” the way we live вЂ” it's fear вЂ” that's what defines us.
3) 0) text: 65 Fitch and Nina return: he with the magnets in hand, she a few steps behind him. Taking note the massage chair by th window, he crosses to it.
3) 2) dialog: Fear of change. Fear of the future. Technology transforming things faster than people can take in. It turns us into strangers, everyone. That's why people create the art they create. (CONTINUED)
3) 6) dialog: What is?
3) 8) dialog: So what would you suggest?
3) 10) dialog: And then do we all sit cross-legged on the floor, humming like gnats?
3) 21) dialog: 69 Although Fitch continues his acupressure strong and hard, the mood вЂ” in contrast to Nina and Douglas вЂ” seems downright pacific.
3) 22) dialog: Do you have any family, Fitch? Wife, children? Fitch shakes his head.
3) 23) dialog: Mother, father?
3) 25) dialog: I try to stay close to my family. It's important, don't you think? My sister's in Boston, my brother's in Georgia somewhere, my parents are retired in Florida, but we work at it. It's important. Don't you think?
3) 30) dialog: (v.o.) What makes you think that?
3) 34) dialog: A "bankruptcy of spirit" вЂ” is that really what we're about?
3) 36) dialog: My work, I suppose, has a spiritual side to it.
3) 43) dialog: Each artist is unique.
3) 47) dialog: Each has individual needs.
3) 53) dialog: People understand that when they come to me. Usually, that's why they come to me. Artists are rarely as troubled by the idea of their earning a living as everyone else seems to be. (CONTINUED)
3) 58) dialog: (breathless) Why do you ask? Fitch lays off on the acupressure, smoothing over the are with lush, soothing strokes.
3) 59) dialog: I had aspirations, artistic aspirations. Except that I saw myself up onstage somewhere, a performer. Only problem was I couldn't sing or dance. I could audition. I mean, my gift is I know how to sell and so I sold myself. And in rehearsal, come to think of it, I was okay, passable.
3) 61) dialog: No. Lucky man. She laughs at this. But if what she says is an exaggeration, there clearly remains some element of truth to it.
3) 62) dialog: It was in school, mostly. But once or twice, in an otherwise professional theatre, I actually got up in front of a paying audience ... and made them pay.
3) 66) dialog: Oh, the same way most people end up doing things. I fell in love with the wrong person.
3) 68) dialog: Artist, art dealer, art critic вЂ” he was all artistic things to all artistic people.
3) 72) dialog: 80 as he leads her from the massage chair back to the massag table.
3) 74) dialog: Who can say really?
3) 83) dialog: 84 as she slackens her mind and allows it to roam.
3) 86) dialog: 86 In contrast, Fitch's contact with her strikes us as far more sexual вЂ” superficially, at least вЂ” than Douglas' But appearances can, as they say, be deceiving. For as erotic as this foot massage may seem, it is, for Fitch, far more transcendental than sexual. Once more, hi eyes close, his mind soars, and his hands seem to assume will and intelligence of their own.
3) 90) dialog: I like what I do, where I've ended up, who I am. It gives me an enormous amount of satisfaction. A brief beat, then: (CONTINUED)
3) 93) dialog: Are you happy, Fitch?
3) 95) dialog: You said you've spent all this time traveling around. I was just wondering if it made you happy.
3) 98) dialog: Meaning what? Suddenly, we are back into the foot massage, with it near We take a beat, then:
3) 100) dialog: Something spiritual.
3) 108) dialog: 90 With his hand reaching under her belly, resting below her solar plexus, he pauses for a moment.
3) 109) dialog: It all sounds very ... Eastern. Fitch withdraws his hand and takes a step back.
3) 111) dialog: Is it?
3) 113) dialog: (smug) It's like some shared subconscious. Almost like people are programmed to invent them. (CONTINUED)
3) 132) dialog: (mocking) Tell me you've got a crystal in that bag of yours.
3) 134) dialog: Because I could stand to know which Two Hearts are causing me my pain. Fitch is visibly annoyed, noticeably tired of humoring he smugness. He wanders away from the table.
3) 136) dialog: Sometimes it just works.
3) 138) dialog: I like clergymen even less than doctors. (CONTINUED)
3) 142) dialog: I see. So you're suggesting вЂ” what? вЂ” I convert? Become a Hopi mystic? Can you do that, by the way? Convert to another race?
3) 144) dialog: Christ, you're patronizing.
3) 146) dialog: Except you. Fitch is plainly taken aback. Abruptly, we:
3) 157) dialog: Where have you been, Fitch? in your travels?
3) 161) dialog: For example.
3) 163) dialog: Massaged your way from one end of the world to the other? He nods.
3) 164) dialog: I envy that.
3) 166) dialog: Having no responsibilities.
3) 168) dialog: Why did you come here tonight, Fitch?
3) 170) dialog: The Far East, Africa, the Aborigines вЂ” I'm not your style. Doug asked me to. different.
3) 172) dialog: (pleased) Did he? (extremely pleased) I like him.
3) 176) dialog: What?
3) 178) dialog: Adrift?
3) 180) dialog: Why would he say that?
3) 182) dialog: What do you suppose that means? adrift? Fitch takes this as a rhetorical question until вЂ”
3) 183) dialog: I mean ... what does it mean?
3) 185) dialog: How would he know? He's a kid.
3) 187) dialog: All my life, it's been the same thing: men refusing to see me for who I am, projecting their idea of who I should be on me instead. Now, even the guy does my massages wants me to be something I'm not.
3) 191) dialog: The tormented, career-obsessed woman. I mean, why not take a little bit of a risk and get to know someone on a more complex level? I really thought more of Douglas вЂ” I know he's your friend вЂ” but I really thought more of him.
3) 193) dialog: What? As she looks on curiously, he pours oil across the top of the table and begins working it in like a Japanese steak chef.
3) 196) dialog: Isn't it?
3) 198) dialog: It is. Getting to know someone is always a risk.
3) 200) dialog: In every way, in every conceivable way.
3) 205) dialog: What do you think? I just got it.
3) 210) dialog: Intimacy вЂ” whether it's emotional or intellectual or sexual вЂ” I think it can be very threatening.
3) 212) dialog: Christ.
3) 217) dialog: Why doesn't it matter вЂ” what you think? (CONTINUED)
3) 223) dialog: It is a fundamental difference between men and women.
3) 225) dialog: The level of intimacy they're willing to give themselves up to. And I mean any relationship, not just a sexual вЂ” romantic вЂ” one....
3) 227) dialog: What?
3) 229) dialog: You are trying to get a rise out of me? Does it sound it? to.
3) 231) dialog: It's like that old thing we used to debate: of what drives a man after sex, whether it's nature or nurture that makes him want to run for the door while the woman will lie there forever. (CONTINUED)
3) 235) dialog: I never said anything about strangers.
3) 237) dialog: Obviously, you don't know the same men I do.
3) 241) dialog: 104 as he now massages her inner thigh, plucking the flesh there.
3) 242) dialog: What a man wants is an illusion: of what a woman is, of what a man and a woman are together.
3) 244) dialog: What's that?
3) 247) dialog: (quickly cutting him off) All men are alike. In certain fundamental respects. I speak from experience: two bad marriages вЂ” count 'em вЂ” before I was 27. There are some variations, but they don't amount to much. She lies contemplatively for a moment, then:
3) 248) dialog: Except maybe ...
4) 0) text: 105 Nina and the painter lie in bed together, aprГЁs-sex.
4) 5) dialog: Nothing. Fitch removes the colored clothes and begins to cover her up with the towel.
4) 6) dialog: You really don't have to bother with that, you know.
4) 8) dialog: The towel. Covering up. I'm not very modest, I'm afraid. I actually prefer nothing on. That's the way Douglas always does it. (CONTINUED)
4) 12) dialog: Get away with it, how?
4) 14) dialog: Gay?
4) 20) dialog: (lying) Of course.
4) 22) dialog: Sure. Yes.
4) 24) dialog: Very upfront.
4) 26) dialog: You're not. (CONTINUED)
4) 30) dialog: Nevertheless.
4) 32) dialog: Still.
4) 34) dialog: The towel.
4) 45) dialog: Once. He now goes to work: first, oiling one side of her buttoc then the other; next, working in the oil with slow, glistening, voluptuous strokes.
4) 54) dialog: 114 as he keeps up the slow, voluptuous strokes. If what he does is not sexual, it's a pretty decent imititation, though neither one of them says or does anything to acknowledge it.
4) 55) dialog: Tell me about your family, Fitch.
4) 57) dialog: Your family now gone.
4) 59) dialog: What was your father?
4) 65) dialog: Sounds fun. (CONTINUED)
4) 74) dialog: How? Making his hands broad, he massages all over her buttocks in big, circular strokes.
4) 84) dialog: (v.o.) Why?
4) 93) dialog: And how old were you?
4) 95) dialog: So what did you do?
4) 97) dialog: What do you mean?
4) 101) dialog: (v.o.) And what did he do then?
4) 107) dialog: That's it?
4) 109) dialog: No apologies or вЂ” and you weren't angry?
4) 111) dialog: Not at all?
4) 113) dialog: What was it about?
4) 115) dialog: I don't know anyone who doesn't feel some sort of ambivalence toward their parents. They are who they are, you are who they are, but then again you're not.
6) 6) dialog: With my family, my parents, it was more вЂ” what? вЂ” being invisible, I guess. My father was an engineer.
6) 9) dialog: (v.o.) He invented all these things you'd never see, things that went inside huge industrial machines to make them run faster or smoother or safer.
6) 12) dialog: But he never owned any of his inventions; his company did. So he never made any money to speak of. And the things he created went inside other things. So no one outside that company even knew who he was. He just did his thing.
6) 14) dialog: Everybody wants recognition.
6) 18) dialog: With my mother, it was pretty much the same thing.
6) 21) dialog: (v.o.) She had the only acceptable job any woman had in those days вЂ” a nurse. And a good one.
6) 23) dialog: But like every other nurse, she was totally ignored, stepped on by any doctor she ever worked with. Another beat, then:
6) 24) dialog: It used to break my heart to see it: two people like that, as gifted as they were, as caring. I swore I wouldn't live that way....
6) 27) dialog: (v.o.) Which is what led me to Andy, I guess. Andy was on the faculty of the art department at the college I was going to.
6) 30) dialog: 134 Closing his eyes, Fitch continues massaging her inner thigh, searching her by sense of touch only.
6) 31) dialog: And for someone like me вЂ” eighteen, small-town girl, anonymous вЂ” it was ... liberation. It took about three years, but we did it finally вЂ” got married вЂ” my parents weren't too pleased.
6) 33) dialog: Good question. Let's see. three weeks, anyway. He smiles, believing that she's joking. Two, She's not.
6) 35) dialog: Well, as popular as my husband was oncampus, he was rever border.
6) 38) dialog: (v.o.) And hard as it is to believe today, I didn't have a clue.
6) 40) dialog: I was eighteen, nineteen, twenty years old. I was a child FITCH - eager for attention. (CONTINUED)
6) 43) dialog: Andy was charming, but the truth is he wasn't very smart. He made one trip too many through customs.
6) 47) dialog: I guess I should be grateful it wasn't on our honeymoon. A thoughtful beat, then:
6) 48) dialog: Yeah, I did it for the attention, sure. Which can't be said about my second husband. Because I took my parents' advice after that. I settled down with a decent, honorable, hard-working young man. It was like taking a four-year nap. A brief beat, then:
6) 49) dialog: They were mistakes.
6) 51) dialog: Not really. Well, maybe. I did decide the only men you should ever seriously consider marrying are the ones who already are. For the most part, they've had some experience at it.
7) 0) text: 140 As Nina sits, Fitcjh prepares his Japanese acupressure heating pads.
7) 3) dialog: How about you?
7) 5) dialog: Married?
7) 7) dialog: Never?
7) 9) dialog: Close? I suppose. you mean.
7) 11) dialog: A serious relationship. A "meaningful" relationship. You've had one of those, I would hope.
7) 15) dialog: But nothing that stirred up the old conjugal instinct.
7) 17) dialog: The desire to mate вЂ” sure.
7) 19) dialog: No, I suppose not.
7) 21) dialog: Right.
7) 23) dialog: Oh, so you're a romantic.
9) 1) dialog: Who was she? 145
10) 1) dialog: How'd you meet her?
11) 2) dialog: Understand what?

13) 7) dialog: Not always.
13) 9) dialog: Or maybe you just think you've gotten to that point.
13) 11) dialog: And you like surprises? Fitch smiles ambiguously.
13) 12) dialog: Or is it variety? (CONTINUED)
13) 15) dialog: I don't. I don't like surprises. And I don't like variety. Variety is a guy in a leather jock strap who's just had his nipples pierced. And don't think I haven't dated them. A long beat, as he slides his hands up to her knee and begins massaging the lower thigh.
13) 19) dialog: And what are you seeing?
13) 23) dialog: I guess I really shouldn't blame people for what they think of me. No more than I should blame myself. So much of what people do is just invention, anyway, inventing themselves, inventing their friendships FITCH And is that what you did: invent yourself?
13) 24) dialog: Didn't you? Poor little rich boy runs off to join the Indians. (CONTINUED)
13) 28) dialog: It's what it is. Fitch quite obviously disagrees with this. He nevertheles resists objecting, instead massaging her in pensive silence.
13) 31) dialog: Am I really an empty room?
13) 33) dialog: Even now?
13) 37) dialog: We're alike, I guess, you and me.
13) 39) dialog: Don't I?
13) 41) dialog: I know that self-indulgence is not self-fulfillment. (CONTINUED)
13) 45) dialog: Yes. Yes, you do. In the worst way of all. You hide behind your soul, behind this ooga-booga bullshit. Fitch is stung sufficiently that he stops working. shifts her weight to look up at him. Nina
13) 49) dialog: No.
13) 56) dialog: Excuse me?
13) 62) dialog: What is?
13) 64) dialog: How do you mean?
13) 66) dialog: I'm not sure I follow. (CONTINUED)
13) 70) dialog: I do.
13) 72) dialog: A few.
13) 74) dialog: Did I say that?
13) 77) dialog: 164 as he moves his hands slowly around her breasts, encircli the nipples, coming teasingly close to touching them only to pull away. He repeats this pattern once or twice more until, finally he lets his fingers caress her nipples. Her back tenses. He gently pulls at them, twisting them slightly as he doe She exhales loudly. He pinches them between his thumb and index finger. Her body stiffens.
13) 79) dialog: 165 as he brings his hands back to her collarbone, never havi touched her nipples directly, leaving her visibly frustrated. (CONTINUED)
13) 82) dialog: Are you going to hold up your crystals and tell me I'm of Two Hearts?
13) 84) dialog: And there are people who live in refrigerator crates who'd trade places in a second. I buy things, I admit it. But I'm not a materialist. Not really. Because, to me, things are things. They mean nothing.
13) 86) dialog: Well, all I know is I usually end up just getting frustrated by all that conspicuous consumption, angry even.
13) 88) dialog: I see what you're doing, you know. You're trying to convince me how miserable I am.
13) 90) dialog: No, just pissing me off.
13) 92) dialog: (the rage slowly building) Because unlike you, nothing was ever (MORE) (CONTINUED)
13) 96) dialog: Not anymore. A long beat, as they remain eye-to-eye for a moment. She then slide herself off the table, rising to her feet.
13) 97) dialog: You know what they difference is between you and me? Really? The difference is you have spent so much time completely rationalizing your life that you actually believe it.... You are a very lonely man, Fitch.
13) 99) dialog: Who?
13) 101) dialog: 166 as he spider-walks his fingers around her breasts, encircling the nipples.
13) 106) dialog: Expect who to?
13) 108) dialog: 168 as he lets his fingers caress her nipples, then gently pulls at them, twisting them slightly as he does, then pinches them between his thumb and his index finger. 169
13) 109) dialog: 169 as she backs off slightly.
13) 112) dialog: I don't know. A beat, then:
13) 113) dialog: Did he say something to you? Douglas? Fitch shakes his head: no. Oh, Christ.
13) 114) dialog: That obvious, hunh? She slouches back toward the massage table.
13) 115) dialog: I know it's nothing to him. He's very discreet about it. And it's not like he does anything more than touch me. It's about as safe as sex gets these days. She now drops herself on the table and sits.
13) 116) dialog: I try to be, too: discreet. We never talk about it. We just pretend it's part of the massage. (CONTINUED)
13) 120) dialog: All relationships are a kind of currency, I've come to the unfortunate conclusion. I'm using you just like you're using me using you using me. On and on it goes.... The money part вЂ” it's, at least, honest. A long beat, then the TELEPHONE RINGS. Both heads snap in the direction of the phone as it rings again ... and again ... and again ... until Nina's answering machine CLICKS ON:
13) 131) dialog: This is not the most relaxing massage I've ever had.
13) 133) dialog: I wasn't being totally honest.
13) 135) dialog: Men. Men and me. As much as I choose not to believe it, the truth is I've been involved with a lot of them. It's always more of the same, sorry to say.
13) 139) dialog: (v.o.) But the middle of last year вЂ” this man just suddenly appeared in my life. An artist.
13) 142) dialog: You've got to understand that in my world so much is done for effect. And here was someone who did nothing for effect вЂ” he was who he was, no apologies.
13) 145) dialog: (v.o.) He treated me well. The painter leans across the table and kisses Nina.
13) 146) dialog: (v.o.) Very well. She smiles at him strangely.
13) 147) dialog: (v.o.) Better than I treated him.
13) 149) dialog: Is that bad? (CONTINUED)
13) 153) dialog: Is everything in your life always so complicated?
13) 157) dialog: And all he expected in return was for me to be me.
13) 162) dialog: It's been a long time вЂ” a long time вЂ” since my various husbands blew through my life. But still. Too much stuff. You don't want to admit how much people affect you, but they do.
14) 25) dialog: Good. Very good.
14) 36) dialog: That's what Douglas charges me.
14) 38) dialog: Take it.
14) 40) dialog: Take it.
14) 42) dialog: Seventy-five, then. She presses all the money in his hand.
14) 43) dialog: With a twenty-five dollar tip. He smiles and pockets the money.
14) 45) dialog: What's that?
14) 47) dialog: And what's that? (CONTINUED)
14) 51) dialog: About you?
14) 54) dialog: Not dropping it вЂ” okay.
14) 56) dialog: All right.
14) 59) dialog: Where did you learn that?

14) 64) dialog: I'd like you to come back next week.
14) 66) dialog: Same day? A brief beat, as he peers into her eyes.
14) 68) dialog: What about him?
14) 70) dialog: Douglas is young.
14) 72) dialog: He'll find someone else to replace me. Women like him. That's what you said.
14) 74) dialog: Do you?
14) 76) dialog: Then, I'll work something out with him. I'll explain the situation. If it's that important, I'll have you both come. But not at the same time. (CONTINUED)
14) 81) dialog: What?
14) 83) dialog: Of course, you were.
