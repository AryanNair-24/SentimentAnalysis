0) 116) dialog: No, not so. But he is young. A lot younger than he thinks he is, anyway. Besides, he could have not called either one of us. A beat, as he walks farther onto the deck, drinking in th surroundings.

0) 146) dialog: What massage is about in the end is healing. There are ways people can heal without drugs or words or prayers. That's it; that's the essence.

0) 158) dialog: (v.o.) The laying on of hands вЂ” there's power in it.
0) 160) dialog: But, in our culture, there are so many Western prejudices about illness and healing. We're really pretty tight-assed, medically speaking. Just think about it: when was the last time your doctor actually touched you? not probed or examined but touched you?
0) 162) dialog: Because they consult with you, they talk with you over the phone, they prescribe drugs for you. But they don't actually вЂ” personally вЂ” heal you. They leave that up to time or chemistry.
0) 168) dialog: How long's that? (beat) It goes back to the ancients, you know.
0) 170) dialog: Massage. Maybe even earlier, some historians think. The Greeks were into massage mainly as a treatment, a healing art. They've got records of people like Socrates and Plato being massaged daily. And Plato lived to be 104.
0) 172) dialog: (undeterred) But the Romans being who they were вЂ” essentially Italians without the loafers вЂ” they were the first to come up with the idea of massage as a form of foreplay. Courtesans got pretty handy at it. It was part of the transaction, finally.

Seeing that he is nearly finished, Nina she sheds her rob It takes a moment for her to locate a towel, during which time Fitch gets an eyeful. He says nothing. She says nothing. But neither her complete lack of embarrassment nor his utter professional disinterest strikes us as entirely authentic. Finally spotting her towel, she draws it carelessly around hersel Fitch stands up.

1) 10) dialog: Any complaints? maladies? any part of your body that needs special attention?
1) 22) dialog: It's best not to talk so much.
1) 24) dialog: Well, it's your massage. You can do anything you'd like. But you really should take some time to relax. I mean, you can't keep going all the time. Or is that what the people you work with do? (CONTINUED)

1) 35) dialog: Almost 20 years вЂ” off and on.
1) 41) dialog: And what sort of person is that?
1) 43) dialog: (more musing than argumentative) Just that I never thought there was a type, that's all. But I suppose you'd know more about that than I would.

1) 65) dialog: This is just me now, this is just my opinion. But so much of what passes for art today вЂ” contemporary art вЂ” is without any kind of reference point: moral, historic, nothing. It's not about anything.

2) 5) dialog: A point of view.
2) 9) dialog: I'll tell you вЂ” and this is why so much of art today is so pointless, I think вЂ” what we suffer from, our society, is a kind of bankruptcy of spirit.
2) 11) dialog: Except this time it's true.
3) 0) text: 65 Fitch and Nina return: he with the magnets in hand, she a few steps behind him. Taking note the massage chair by th window, he crosses to it.
3) 1) dialog: Is this yours? She nods. He indicates that she should sit in it, which she does. He then kneels before her, placing a warmed magnet beneath either of her feet.
3) 5) dialog: Bad faith.

3) 11) dialog: We might. We could. Why not? Or else we could just go out and kill all the gallery owners. A beat, as Nina, amused, smiles to herself.
3) 21) dialog: 69 Although Fitch continues his acupressure strong and hard, the mood вЂ” in contrast to Nina and Douglas вЂ” seems downright pacific.
3) 24) dialog: Gone now. They've been dead a while. I have a sister back in Sydney.
3) 33) dialog: Think what?
3) 35) dialog: Call it what you like. The essence is that we've lost our way. As a civilization. Spiritually, I'm saying. I've been around, and one thing I've learned: we don't know what we don't know. A beat, then:
3) 52) dialog: Although there is the matter of compensation.
3) 56) dialog: (puzzled) So, then, what's the spiritual side to your work? But before she can respond, the strength of his acupressu her to exhale hoarsely suddenly.
3) 57) dialog: (as he persists in applying pressure) This isn't too hard for you, Nina?
3) 60) dialog: Would I have ever seen you in anything?
3) 63) dialog: (amused) So how'd the gallery business get you? (CONTINUED)
3) 67) dialog: Artist?
3) 72) dialog: 80 as he leads her from the massage chair back to the massag table.
3) 73) dialog: And what happened to him?
3) 86) dialog: 86 In contrast, Fitch's contact with her strikes us as far more sexual вЂ” superficially, at least вЂ” than Douglas' But appearances can, as they say, be deceiving. For as erotic as this foot massage may seem, it is, for Fitch, far more transcendental than sexual. Once more, hi eyes close, his mind soars, and his hands seem to assume will and intelligence of their own.
3) 94) dialog: Happy?
3) 96) dialog: It's made me a better person. Sure. I suppose. Happier than most people. If that's what it's about. Nina seems puzzled.
3) 97) dialog: There's more to happiness than being happy.
3) 99) dialog: You see, with most people вЂ” cultures вЂ” civilizations вЂ” this idea of happiness вЂ” it's not some frivolous thing. It's not a good job. It's not a new car in the driveway. It's something else entirely.
3) 101) dialog: (with a reflexive nod) The Hopi Indians believe the body of a person and the earth are formed in the same way: along an axis. Fitch gives up her feet for a moment and glides his hand upward along her legs until he reaches her spine, which h then gently massages. (CONTINUED)
3) 104) dialog: The axis for you and me is our backbone, our spine. And along this axis are various centers of force NINA Centers of force?
3) 106) dialog: (v.o.) They're all very important, these different body centers: the brain, the throat, the solar plexus. But the most important of all is the heart. Follow its sincere purpose, the Hopis say, and you're of one heart. But if you allow evil feelings to enter, they say you are of two hearts. ....
3) 108) dialog: 90 With his hand reaching under her belly, resting below her solar plexus, he pauses for a moment.
3) 110) dialog: Well, it is, in a way.
3) 112) dialog: The Tibetans and Hindus believed in an almost identical series of centers in the body.
3) 116) dialog: Almost. A beat, as he sizes her up, wondering if she has even an inkling as to what he's been saying. Then:
3) 117) dialog: Now to me, personally, the most interesting part of this is how the Hopi medicine man takes these centers of force and treats someone.
3) 123) dialog: Sometimes what's wrong is what you'd call illness. But other times, it comes from outside, drawn by a person's own evil thoughts or from those of a Two Heart.
3) 131) dialog: And that way, he can see the source of the trouble and, the Hopis say, the actual face of the Two Hearts who's causing it. A beat, then Fitch returns his hands to Nina's feet and resumes massaging them.
3) 133) dialog: (with an unamused laugh) No.
3) 135) dialog: It works, though, you know, this kind of healing. What we forget is modern medicine вЂ” any science when you think about it вЂ” is a belief system: a religion like any other religion. Medicine works because we believe it will work.
3) 137) dialog: And lots of times it doesn't.
3) 141) dialog: That's because you worship in the temple of Art. Which is a whole lot like the temple of Science, when you get right down to it. Your God is a jealous God вЂ” the most jealous God of all, in fact вЂ” the God of Reason.
3) 143) dialog: The point I was making, really, is that we have вЂ” without even realizing it вЂ” given up one kind of mysticism for another, more socially acceptable form of mysticism. I don't know about you, but I've never seen a black hole or a quark. They may exist; they may not; I personally have no way of knowing. I have seen Hopis walk away healed, though, by nothing more than a medicine man using his hands and a few crystals.
3) 145) dialog: All I'm saying is we вЂ” everyone вЂ” we've gone and replaced a system of belief with a system of disbelief. And that it's found its way into everything we do and think. We've lost the capacity for wonder. And no one вЂ” and this is the insidious part вЂ” no one even knows that it's happened.
3) 152) dialog: They understand themselves, the Hopis.
3) 158) dialog: More places than I can sometimes remember. (CONTINUED)
3) 162) dialog: Pretty much wherever the spirit took me. The Far East, Africa. A year with the aborigines in Australia.
3) 165) dialog: Traveling the world?

3) 181) dialog: Doug's got the touch. Another beat, then:
3) 184) dialog: Your heart, your spirit вЂ” you're searching.
3) 186) dialog: Not as much of a kid as he thinks he is.
3) 188) dialog: And what's that? (CONTINUED)
3) 192) dialog: So it's a risk? He guides her off the table, which seems to surprise her.
3) 194) dialog: Complexity. She seems not to understand.
3) 195) dialog: Just now, you said he wouldn't risk knowing you on a more complex level. So: is complexity dangerous?
3) 197) dialog: You said it was.
3) 199) dialog: In what way?
3) 207) dialog: (v.o.) I'm not sure I get it.
3) 211) dialog: Or a risk? Threatening? Semantics?
3) 213) dialog: No, I'm trying to understand you. You said Doug didn't. So I'm trying to. He covers her with other colored cloths.
3) 214) dialog: That's what these are for. Colors draw things out of you вЂ” even in silence.
3) 224) dialog: What is?
3) 226) dialog: And you base that on...?
3) 228) dialog: Well, I'm just not sure there is this huge difference. I haven't seen it, anyway.
3) 230) dialog: I didn't mean it
3) 234) dialog: And that's it? That's the difference? The etiquette of sex with a stranger?
3) 236) dialog: Well, as much as he might be tempted, I don't think a man's going to bolt for the door the minute he's had sex with his wife.
3) 241) dialog: 104 as he now massages her inner thigh, plucking the flesh there.

4) 15) dialog: Doug.
4) 19) dialog: You knew he was gay?
4) 21) dialog: He said you did.
4) 23) dialog: He's usually very upfront about it.
4) 25) dialog: In fact, that's how he and I met. He thought I was. Well, I'd actually worked on a friend of his who thought I was.
4) 29) dialog: (with a shake of the head) But Doug thinks everybody's gay. That's part of his charm. I actually think he's bisexual in some halfassed way. A brief beat, then:
4) 31) dialog: What?
4) 33) dialog: Yes?
4) 44) dialog: If you're ever interested in something a little different, you might want to try shiatsu. It's all about stimulating energy at different points in the body. No oil of any kind. Skin rarely touches skin. I've tried it.
4) 49) dialog: And if I do?
4) 51) dialog: I'll risk it.
4) 54) dialog: 114 as he keeps up the slow, voluptuous strokes. If what he does is not sexual, it's a pretty decent imititation, though neither one of them says or does anything to acknowledge it.
4) 56) dialog: My family?
4) 58) dialog: Not much to tell.
4) 60) dialog: Executive. Ad man. But his family had money to begin with. My mother's side, too. Not a lot, but money. Comfortable I guess is how they'd describe themselves.
4) 63) dialog: (v.o.) They used to do things like dress for dinner every Saturday night.

4) 70) dialog: (v.o.) Someone from my father's agency вЂ” some client and his wife.
4) 72) dialog: But, usually, it was just the family: my parents, my sister and me.
4) 73) dialog: It's funny. Talking about roles. My parents had these roles that they always seemed to ... inhabit. My father was the shrewd businessman. My mother was the thoughtful patron of the arts. Which was, as it turned out, a kind of fiction.
4) 75) dialog: Well, it was all the same to her. Classical music. Classical art. Didn't matter who or what it was. It was all lovely. The woman вЂ” and over the years I've come to almost admire this about her вЂ” she didn't have a critical bone in her body. She was the sort of person they created public television for.

4) 83) dialog: (v.o.) My father took one look at me and вЂ” well, he wasn't pleased, let's say that.
4) 85) dialog: (v.o.) It was my bow tie. He said that by wearing one of those clip-on bow ties I was humiliating him beyond humiliation....

4) 94) dialog: Seventeen. But he wasn't ranting, you have to understand. Never.
4) 96) dialog: I pulled apart the tie.
4) 100) dialog: (v.o.) Because it wasn't a clip-on tie. It was your standard, J. Press bow tie. But I'd tied it so well, I'd done the tie so perfectly, that it looked too good.

13) 83) dialog: No. But, you see, what I believe is not "ooga-booga bullshit." It comes from first-hand experience. There are people who have possessions, lots of possessions, and they are made miserable by them.

He stands back for a moment, as if not quite knowing what to do next. He then reaches for a bottle and spreads oil thickly across her belly, from just below her breasts. He now begins some short, deep strokes across her abdomen careful to avoid even the slightest contact with anything like an erogenous zone. Sexual contact would, in any case, be totally extraneous this point. For in some perceptible though indescribable way, the two are now connected more completely and more intimately than sex would ever have allowed them to be.

14) 18) dialog: I came to a place once, not long ago. It was a lonely place, an empty place with no hope and, I thought, no way out. It's a place I could have easily been lost in forever. But, slowly, I began to understand something вЂ” that I put myself in that place, and that it was up to me to get myself out. And so I chose hope. I chose belief. (physically referring to his various mystical items) You see, it's all true. God has to be all things to all people. To be anything less would be less than perfect вЂ” human.
