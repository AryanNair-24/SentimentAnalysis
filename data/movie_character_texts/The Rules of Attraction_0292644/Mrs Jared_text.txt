37) 35) dialog: (to Richard, her son) I leave you alone for five minutes and you're drinking?!
37) 39) dialog: Then take a shower and sober up. (to Mrs. Denton) Will my tortures never end? (she turns abruptly to Paul) How are you Paul?
37) 41) dialog: Would you talk to him? He’1l listen to you. She walks out. Mrs. Denton shrugs her shoulders with a smile, “what can I do?”
41) 0) text: CLOSE ON: Paul, freshly showered. Paul is sitting at a table with his mother, Mrs. Jared, a Richard in the center of the massive and elegant dining r of the Ritz-Carlton. A PIANO ARRANGEMENT of “Libiamo” fro Giuseppe Verdi’s La Traviata is being played by an EXPERT PIANIST. WAITERS dressed in new expensive tuxedos move quickly, gracefully, from table to table. ELDERLY WOMEN w too much make-up on, slumped lazily, drunkenly in the red velvet chairs, stare and smile. We’re surrounded by very money. (CONTINUED )
41) 6) dialog: I’m going to ask you one more time, Richard. Will you kindly remove your sunglasses. He totally ignores her. Paul is highly self-conscious and wants to dissipate into the ether.
41) 7) dialog: Very well then. (perhaps trying reverse psychology) Why don’t you tell us about school. Richard looks at her, reaches into his pocket, pulls out Marlboro, and grabs a candle from the middle of the table lights it.
41) 8) dialog: (disapprovingly as he places the candle back) Oh, don’t smoke. Honestly, Richard. Paul eyes Richard's cigarette, whose smoke seems to ascen an unnatural and sexual SLOW-MOTION.
41) 12) dialog: What is it then?
41) 14) dialog: What?
41) 16) dialog: No. Your name is Richard.
41) 18) dialog: Well...Dick...how is school?
41) 20) dialog: What classes are you taking...Dick?
41) 28) dialog: What has happened to you?
41) 30) dialog: I can see what that school has done to you.
41) 32) dialog: No. No. If anyone’s going to leave the table it’s going to be Richard.
41) 34) dialog: Leave the table, Richard. Now.
41) 36) dialog: (quieter, but more intense) I’m asking you to leave the table. Now. Paul and his mother are watching the entire exchange in silent horror.
41) 38) dialog: (command) Leave the table.
41) 42) dialog: Everything is fine now. I’m really terribly sorry. MAITRE D’ Are you sure, Madame?
41) 43) dialog: Positive. My son isn’t...well. He has a lot of pressures...you know, with...with mid-terms coming up. (she inhales in an attempt to relax) I would like another Vodka Collins. (to Mrs. Denton) Eve, would you like anything?
