It’s not really all that sexy, a drunk person never is, but Richard and Paul obvio have a past...and that transcends the alcohol. Suddenly, MRS. DENTON, Paul’s mother, and MRS. JARED, Richard's mother, walk into the room. They’re too good to true: Big hair, too much money, too much time, too much plastic surgery. One time sexy women who managed to nab r men and spend the rest of their life spending. It’s Louis Vitton all the way.
