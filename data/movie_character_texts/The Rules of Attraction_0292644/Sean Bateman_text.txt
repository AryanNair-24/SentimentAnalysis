TRACK BACKWARDS past a beat up Sean Bateman (who I’11 describe later). Some ripped apart purple envelopes and their accompanying letters come lifting up and out of a beercup-filled trashcan and into his hand.

5) 4) dialog: (narrating) A great numb feeling washes over me as I let go of the past and look forward to the future. I pretend to be a vampire -- and I don’t really need to pretend because it’s who I am. An emotional vampire. I’ve just come to expect it. That vampires are real. That I was born this way. That I feed off of other people’s real emotions. I search for this nights prey...who will it be?

5) 14) dialog: Yeah it is.
5) 16) dialog: No. Freshmen.
5) 19) dialog: Nope. A Freshmen. Peter. Peter the Freshmen. As SHE CONTINUES TALKING, Sean ZONES HER VOICE OUT and focuses instead on her mouth. He lips are natural and ful her mouth rounder than most.
5) 20) dialog: She has dick sucking lips -- so I consider the options...
5) 22) dialog: (continuing) I can leave right now, go back to my room, play the guitar, masturbate to DSL- speed Internet porn, go to sleep. In a QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS we see: Sean sitting at the be with a tiny Fender amp STRIKING CHORDS; Sean, his guitar resting next to him, sits at a desk chair without his pan jacking off to hard-core German erotica; and Sean laying bed and turning off the light. DARKNESS.

7) 3) dialog: (continuing) Or, I could take her to the Carousel for some coffee and ditch her there with the bill. A WAITRESS walks past and leaves a bill on the rim of the table.
8) 1) dialog: (continuing) Or, I could take her back to my room, hope the Frog is gone, get stoned and fuck her.

9) 1) dialog: (continuing) She slowly followed me back to my dorm room like she knew this would happen -- too eager, too stunned to speak. I was so excited I couldn’t stop shaking and I dropped the key when I tried to unlock the door. (CONTINUED )
9) 5) dialog: (continuing) She sat on the bed and I played her a song I had written myself and then segued into “You’re Too Good To Be True”. I played it quietly and sang the lyrics Slowly and softly and she was so moved that she started to actually cry... Sure enough, she is crying.
9) 7) dialog: (continuing) Maybe it was the Ecstasy I’m pretty sure she was on -- maybe it was that she thought she loved me. But when-- --Suddenly, mid-sentance, THE IMAGE REVERSES as if we wer previously looking into a mirror. Maybe we’re looking int mirror now. Right has become left, left has become right...everything has flipped--
9) 8) dialog: (continuing) --he kissed her on the lips he instantly went hard. She was still crying, and her face was slick, but she let him pull her clothes off. Has the first person narration switched to third person? Sean undresses her quickly -- urgently -- and pulls his o pants down. (CONTINUED )
9) 11) dialog: (continuing) She had no panties on, and had the body of a much younger girl. Her breasts were small but full, yet the nipples weren’t hard, not even after he touched them, then kissed and licked them. She smelled like sweet fruit. Her snatch was small too -- the pubic hair light and sparse. Yet, when he fingered her he didn’t feel anything. She wasn’t getting wet even though she was making soft little moans.
9) 13) dialog: (continuing) He was semi-stiff, and losing his erection. Something was wrong. Something was missing. He didn’t know what. Sean mounts her and fumbles his way in...
9) 14) dialog: (continuing) Confused, he started to fuck her, and before he came, it hit him: he can’t remember the last time he had sex sober... FREEZE FRAME: Sean’s face is locked in a contortion, froz in time. We still hear the GRUNTS of sex, and of course:

16) 3) dialog: Please. I get enough Franglais from having the Frog as a roommate. Do not accost me with your bad French accent before the nine o’clock hour.
16) 5) dialog: (flat and deflated) Oh. Shit. There goes another class.
16) 9) dialog: (ignoring Getch) What issue is on this morning’s agenda?
16) 11) dialog: I screwed Sari during my second year.
16) 16) dialog: Let’s face it, Tim. You got stuck with the short end of the stick. Next time you'll know to double wrap before you enter Vagina Girl’s cave of doom.

16) 44) dialog: (despite the fact that he has no plate of food...) Eating. The situation is highly uncomfortable.
16) 48) dialog: (meaningless) Yeah. I’m going to the party tonight. You going to the party tonight?
16) 50) dialog: (not looking at her and instead taking a sip of coffee) Well. I guess I’ll...see you there.
16) 52) dialog: Okay. See you there. Bye.
16) 54) dialog: (under his breath) Go away. She walks away, slightly dejected, to a table with SOME O GIRLS and sits with them. The guys at Sean’s table aren’t saying anything.
16) 56) dialog: Rock and roll. At the same time this entire scene has been unfolding, ac the dining hall, another conversation has been taking place...
17) 0) text: SEAN enters the Post Office. A FEW OTHER STUDENTS mill ab writing letters while standing, buying stamps, CHATTING. Sean heads towards the student mailboxes. Sean opens his box and pulls several letters out. Mostly junk and fliers to clubs. Nothing personal, except: A fan purple envelope with a simple hand-drawn heart around the hand-typed name “Sean Bateman”. All the other mail gets thrown into a large trashcan. Sean looks around the room to see if anyone is watching h Anybody could have dropped this note in his box. There’s COUPLE KISSING near the window, Lauren is walking down th hall past the post office, Paul and the dumb blond kid fr L.A. are playing Frisbee golf nearby. But no one is looki at him. Sean lifts the purple letter to his nose, almost as if by compulsion, and smells it -- it’s scented. He shuts his eyes. He then eagerly opens it and as he pulls the lavender let out from inside glitter falls from the letter and onto hi sweater. Instead of being upset, Sean is pleasantly surprised and delighted.
17) 1) dialog: (with admiration) You sneaky bitch. He brushes as much of the glitter from his sweater as possible and then reads the letter...
17) 2) dialog: (reading the letter text) “Got you. You’re mine now for the rest of the day, week, month, year...life. Have you guessed who I am yet? Sometimes (more ) (CONTINUED)
17) 5) dialog: I think you have. Sometimes when you’re scanning a crowd I feel those sultry dark eyes of yours stop on me. Are you too afraid to come up to me and let me know how you feel? I want to moan and writhe with you and I want to go up to you and kiss your mouth and pull you to me and say ‘love you love you love you love you’ while stripping -- while sex commences. I want you so bad it stings. I want to kill the ugly girls that you’re always with. Do you really like those boring naive coy calculating girls, or is it just for sex? The seeds of love have taken hold and if we won’t burn together, I’1l burn alone.” Sean looks around again. No one is watching. He folds up the letter and puts it into his pocket. He walks out of t post office.
19) 1) dialog: (over the music) What’s going on? Sean walks over to the stereo and turns down the volume. Rupert jumps up, pumped from doing push-ups, and walks quickly into Sean’s space. He smiles an evil smile, revealing a diamond in one of his front teeth.
19) 3) dialog: (nervously laughing) Why, Rupert?
19) 5) dialog: (trying to spin it into a joke) Take American Express? (CONTINUED )
19) 10) dialog: (wincing from pain) I’m not your enemy...Rupert...and I don’t have a weapon-- Rupert releases his hand and lets him fall to the ground.
19) 13) dialog: (getting up off the floor) Sure.
19) 17) dialog: Rupert. There’s an orgy in Booth tonight. I’m scoring for a bunch of Freshmen. They’re rich. They want cocaine. They’ll pay a premium to get it. What do you think? Rupert is open mouthed and astonished. Then, like caged animal, he suddenly starts pacing. Ever see Quentin Tarantino walk? Well, this is how Rupert walks. It’s the kind of walk that when you see it coming toward you, you 43 cross the street to avoid it. His hand gestures are no le extreme and horrific.
19) 19) dialog: Jesus Christ, Rupert. Don’t get so tense.
19) 21) dialog: (cringing with his eyes shut) Rupert, I’m not like these rich assholes. I’m on Financial Aid. I’ve got to work for a living. I’m from a fucking farm in Nebraska, for Christ’s sake. My parents had to sell the cow to send me here! I’ve got to work in Food Service... (CONTINUED )
19) 25) dialog: No. For real, Rupert. My dad’s in the hospital and...can’t work the land...and, um...the family is strapped for cash... and I might have to drop out...and... please, Rupert...please... don’t...
19) 27) dialog: The Lord as my witness, yes.
19) 29) dialog: No. I had to work all Summer to pay for this term...
19) 31) dialog: That’s what I told everyone...so they wouldn’t laugh at me. I actually had to wash pigs all Summer. Jesus, Rupert...I can get these kids to overpay, they’re so desperate for drugs. I’m your key to moving this shit on campus. You know you need me. And I need the money. We need each other...
19) 38) dialog: (nervous and unsure) Uh...right.
19) 40) dialog: (after thinking about it) Well. Depends on how stepped on it is.

But I’d rather have Lauren. I wonder why? It’s not like Lauren’s sexier...she just seems more innocent. More pure. I need to fuck Lauren. Then I need to get more pot. Sean lights and inhales a puff and then passes the pipe t Paul, who takes a drag. Suddenly, the IMAGE DIVIDES INTO TWO SIMULTANEOUS SPLIT SCREENS. Both sides of the split screen have the exact sa action. Then, suddenly, the ACTION BEGINS TO SLOWLY DEVIATE... On the LEFT SIDE OF THE SPLIT SCREEN we see Paul’s view o things -- he places his hand on Sean’s leg, allows it to slide inward a bit. He then leans in and gently kisses Se on the lips. Sean hesitates for a moment, and then they k harder. Then it’s heavy, Paul pushes Sean back onto the b and starts feeling him all over -- putting his hand up hi shirt to feel his chest -- beginning to make love... On the RIGHT SIDE OF THE SPLIT SCREEN, we see Sean’s view things -- no sex. No kissing. Just beer drinking and pot smoking. Sean is pretty wasted. He passes out, leaving Pa disappointed...
