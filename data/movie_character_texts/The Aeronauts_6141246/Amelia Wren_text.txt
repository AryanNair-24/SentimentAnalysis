It’s a simple grave, but Pierre’s face can occasionally - flickeringly - be made out engraved on the stone - and hi name - PIERRE RENNES. She says nothing. But her face says a thousand things. And then she feels something and looks up. She sees the snowflakes spiralling down around her. She thinks, she touches the stone, she smiles.

AMELIA is shivering, she looks across at JAMES who is desperately trying to conceal how cold he is. He takes a series of readings. But every step he takes, e inch he moves, costs him dearly and he is really struggli to lift his head. AMELIA looks up at the balloon, it looks like it’s bursti at the seams. She moves alongside him to help with his instrumentation. The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 60

The two twist over in the bottom of the basket. It’s an ugly fight, desperate and full of passion. These are inexperienced (and not particularly accomplished) fighters and the altitude is sapping their strength. But eventually JAMES manages to pin AMELIA down.
39) 1) dialog: You gave me your word. It is time to descend.
39) 3) dialog: Can’t you see what’s happening - we're going to die unless we descend now. JAMES looks at her, and then he feels his nose start to bleed, a drop of blood falls onto her cheek, he touches h nose and looks at his blood. He blinks. He rolls over, freeing her. She stays beside him. Both ar exhausted by their efforts. 40 42 The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 62

42) 8) dialog: Stay alive. JAMES collapses backwards to the floor. She looks down at him. She thinks. At this height, every movement is a struggle, but she kno she must find a way to reach the valve. She grips one of the ropes and slowly manoeuvres herself the edge of the basket. She looks down, the layer of cirrus now far below.

She thinks, and then - majestically - she gets to her fee She is standing on top of a balloon that is flying higher than anything has ever flown. She is literally on top of the world. A tiny figure on top of a Mammoth which sits against a va star-filled sky. She looks around herself, admiring it all. And then she brings her foot down hard upon the vent. She smashes down again and again. And the ice cracks. From all sides gas billows out. AMELIA almost disappears within it. We close on her face, she’s oxygen deprived and now breat in coal gas but she has something left. Or does she? She sways, she looks down at the vent, she realises it ne holding open. She takes a knife from her belt. She bends down, coughing wretched coughs as she does, and cuts the laces from her boot. 47 30 31 The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 67 She pulls her foot clear.

We pull back, to see she’s still hanging from the Mammoth a single rope. We look - in the stillness - at this extraordinary balloo with gas pluming its escape out of the top. We twist and turn with AMELIA for a moment, and it’s almo like she’s a bird as she drifts around the balloon.

She swings this way - she swings that - completely severe from a hold on any part of the balloon - completely unabl get hold. She looks around herself - she's hanging about 10 feet aw from the basket. Slowly, ever so slowly she starts to swing herself to and fro. Soon she is swinging enough to reach out to grab one the ropes connecting the netting to the hoop. 52 The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 She tries once - She tries a second time. 69 The third time she gets a decent hold - but it slips away The fourth - she makes her bind.
