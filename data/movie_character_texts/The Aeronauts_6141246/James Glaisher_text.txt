AMELIA looks to where he’s indicating - the sky above the The balloon pushes through the thin layer of cirrus that above them; the final barrier before the heavens. It ascends into a magnificent icy blue. They look up to the deep Prussian blue of the sky above. There are stars everywhere.
36) 32) dialog: There is nothing more mysterious, nor more beautiful, than the stars in the sky, and look at us, we're dancing amongst them. AMELIA digests this with a soft smile. She thinks.

AMELIA is shivering, she looks across at JAMES who is desperately trying to conceal how cold he is. He takes a series of readings. But every step he takes, e inch he moves, costs him dearly and he is really struggli to lift his head. AMELIA looks up at the balloon, it looks like it’s bursti at the seams. She moves alongside him to help with his instrumentation. The AERONAUTS Cut Order - As of 20th July 2019 60
38) 1) dialog: 57 minutes afloat.
38) 4) dialog: Do you know - it’s quite the strangest thing - the higher we fly - the lower the humidity - there is barely any water vapor here at all -
38) 6) dialog: And the temperatures - unprecedented - freezing ranges that nobody has ever predicted. JAMES tries to write down the readings but has difficulty controlling his hands. He looks at his hands - exasperated and then tries again. He looks up at the instruments. He blinks so as to see th He tries to write something a third time, but it’s a scra that’s barely decipherable. He attaches it to a pigeon’s leg. A pigeon that seems bar alive. He throws it out of the balloon - it drops like a stone.

The two twist over in the bottom of the basket. It’s an ugly fight, desperate and full of passion. These are inexperienced (and not particularly accomplished) fighters and the altitude is sapping their strength. But eventually JAMES manages to pin AMELIA down.

She swings for a moment more. She shuts her eyes.

50) 13) dialog: I have been insensible.
50) 15) dialog: I lost my head.

50) 21) dialog: Busy how?
50) 23) dialog: One hour, eleven minutes and six seconds.
50) 25) dialog: Twenty nine thousand six-hundred feet.
50) 27) dialog: Unknown. That equipment has been lost to us. And the hygrometer has had better days. He picks up the Spectroscope. He looks through it. He puts it down.
50) 28) dialog: That has no great use either. The readings on our descent will be less - significant. AMELIA smiles. He smiles back. He looks at her. He looks her hands.
50) 29) dialog: Your hands. AMELIA looks down at her hands, they’re black and purple.
50) 32) dialog: Yes. Well. A scientist is nothing without his equipment. He smiles. She laughs.
50) 33) dialog: Hold them out.
50) 35) dialog: This is going to hurt. AMELIA looks at him. She holds out her hands. JAMES pours brandy over the top of them. This stings. She grits her t to the pain.
50) 36) dialog: Better?
50) 38) dialog: I don’t know what you did for me up there but I have no doubt it was a great act. He takes her hands in his.
50) 39) dialog: Your poor hands. He rubs them gently. It’s beautiful. She looks up at him. He looks back. It begins to snow. He looks around at the snow falling all around them. He grins at her. She smiles back.
50) 41) dialog: It will pass. She smiles again. He takes out a sample glass. He catches the snowdrops. Sh looks at him.
50) 42) dialog: Possibly interesting to analyse the melt water. She nods. And then she picks up a glass and tries to catc them too. He laughs. She does too. The two of them continue in their complicity. And it is beautiful. And then AMELIA looks back at JAMES, a strange smile on h face. JAMES watches as snow flakes land on her shoulders, cheeks, her eyelashes.
51) 3) dialog: We have.
51) 5) dialog: It seems the air gets colder the closer we rise to the sun. The humidity gets less dense despite us floating through clouds, which is also odd. There is a clear lack of oxygen at the upper reaches -—

But whilst we may be able to explain the science behind an aureole, or the falling snow, it is not possible to account for its beauty. No amount of data could have helped me predict that the only person who could have taken us to the heights we reached today - was you. Together, we have brought the stars closer. This line penetrates deep. AMELIA softly smiles.
52) 2) dialog: No.

52) 17) dialog: The car. We lose the basket. AMELIA looks at him and then the fast approaching ground.
52) 18) dialog: It is the heaviest weight. It’s our only option. JAMES climbs into the hoop, but he can’t do it with the glasses in his hand, he throws them over, shutting his ey for a moment, and then clambers up. He holds down a hand help AMELIA inside, she frowns at him and climbs inside.
