53) 4) dialog: Daddy!!! Just around the corner in the chef’s kitchen, the adults’ enjoying a red wine dinner stiffen, as they recognize the voice. Debbie is there, on a double-date with her older sister SANDEE, South African pro golfer-type brother-in-l RUUD, and her “DATE”, one of Ruud’s boys. Debbie cranes her neck to see into the entryway, when she almost faints. Her jaw drops as she mouths, “oh my God.” And then he appears. History’s most uninvited guest. A position that, at least in this instance, he relishes. Ni stands in the middle of the kitchen, nodding hello to the all. He sways a bit, reeks of saké. Debbie’s mouth still hangs agape, she just wants to disappear. They all do. Th date looks like he’s about to puke.
