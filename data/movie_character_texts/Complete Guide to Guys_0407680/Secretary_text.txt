You ever sit in the driver's seat of one of those renta cars? SECRETARY
88) 10) text: Brand new cars, not even two thousand miles on them, and already they drive like camels. The seat's got no cushion left already, and you're lucky if you don't need a chiropractor after twenty minutes in one. What do people do in those things? SECRETARY
