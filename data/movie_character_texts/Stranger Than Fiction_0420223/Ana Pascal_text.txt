Harold stands across from ANA PASCAL, the aforementioned baker: a young, attractive woman with tattoos up on her t pale arms, her hands and face dusted with flour, slipping baguettes into paper sleeves in the back kitchen. The bakery is crowded with CUSTOMERS who clamor over the searing PUNK ROCK that plays. The walls are covered with propaganda calling for the release of Leonard Peltier, th armament of the Zapatistas, and even a mangled, upturned American flag that reads, "Boycott Starbucks." All of the WORKERS look under the age of twenty-one. Most have tatto or piercings and one has a spiked, yellow mohawk. In the corner, a HOMELESS man enjoys a cup of coffee and a Danis a MONGREL DOG lapping at a bowl of water at his side. And oddly enough, all the bustle, propaganda and punk roc is surrounded by chiffon birthday cakes, poppy-seed muffi and the fluffiest, most delicious-looking creme puffs you ever seen.

Oatmeal Cookies. Peanut Butter Bars. Chocolate Chip and Macadamia Nut Wedges. And everyone would eat and stay happy and study harder and do better on the tests and more people would come to the study groups and the study groups got better and I would make more snacks and try to find better recipes and the results would always get better and better and soon it was Cheese and Apricot Croissants and Mocha Bars with Almond Glaze and Lemon Chiffon Cakes with Zesty Peach icing and our study groups were famous around all of Cambridge: not because we had the most copious notes, or the smartest people, but because we had the best snacks...
