27) 0) text: Harold sits in his cubicle, scouring through information online. He rubs his eyes. He clicks on a link. A new window opens to reveal a picture of a man behind a desk in an office filled with books. Harold scans the web page, coming across text that reads something to the effe of, "Literary Dean Emeritus: Professor Jules Hilbert." He clicks on the name. A new photograph is revealed of Hilbert conducting a seminar. The caption reads: "Profess Hilbert in his most popular course: The Entire History of Everything Literate. Harold scans the caption. His fingers stop on the name, “Professor Hilbert."
29) 0) text: Harold is led down a long, dark corridor with rows of off on either side by PROFESSOR HILBERT, a short, older man w speeds down the hall at a clipped pace, one arm through o sleeve of a tweed jacket holding a cup of coffee, the oth out of the jacket holding the book he was reading.
29) 1) dialog: So you're the young gentleman who called me about the narrator?
29) 3) dialog: Says you're gonna die.
29) 5) dialog: Uh-huh. How long has it given you to live?
29) 7) text: Professor Hilbert stops and looks squarely at Harold.
29) 8) dialog: Dramatic irony. It'll fuck you every time. He pats Harold on the shoulder than leads him into an off INT. HILBERT’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS Hilbert's office is quite the same as the photograph and matches him perfectly: There are books everywhere except the bookshelves, various laterai-thinking puzzles are str about (almost all solved) and several rolled up carpets inexplicably lean in the corner. A currently brewing coff maker sits on the windowsill.
29) 9) dialog: Please. Recline. Hilbert offers Harold the couch which is covered in books Harold finds a six inch space and sits. Hilbert tosses ou his coffee and pours himself another cup.
29) 10) dialog: Coffee?
29) 12) dialog: Sure?
29) 14) dialog: So, you're crazy or what?
29) 16) dialog: Are you allowed to say that to crazy people?
29) 18) dialog: Oh well. How many tiles in the hallway out there?
29) 20) dialog: You were counting them as we walked weren't you?
29) 23) dialog: Of course. What bank do you work at?
29) 25) dialog: Live alone?
29) 27) dialog: Any pets?
29) 29) dialog: Friends?
29) 31) dialog: I see. The narrator. Exactly what does he sound like?
29) 33) dialog: Huh. Is it a familiar woman? Someone you know?
29) 35) dialog: But this woman told you you're going to die?
29) 37) dialog: But you believed her.
29) 39) dialog: Such as?
29) 41) dialog: You hate your work. (CONTINUED)
29) 44) dialog: Well. Not the most insightful voice in the world is it... Ist thing on a list of what American's say they hate? Work. 2nd? Traffic. 3rd? Missing socks. See what I'm saying?
29) 46) dialog: I told you you were going to die, you believe me?
29) 48) dialog: Why?
29) 50) dialog: But you don't know this narrator either.
29) 52) dialog: Okay, Mr. Crick. I can't help you.
29) 54) dialog: Well, I'm not an expert in crazy. I'm an expert in literature and I gotta tell you, thus far there’s not a single literary thing about you.
29) 56) dialog: I don‘t doubt you hear a voice, but it couldn't possibly be a narrator because frankly there doesn't seem to be much to narrate. Besides that, this semester I'm teaching five courses, mentoring two doctorate candidates and I'm the faculty lifeguard at the pool.
29) 59) dialog: {feeling sorry for him.) Perhaps you should keep a journal, write down what she's said to you or something.
29) 61) dialog: (overlapping) [Aaah... I'11 tell you... Hawaiian coffee is simply~-} What?
29) 63) dialog: Did you say, "Little did he know?"
29) 65) dialog: Dear God. I've written papers on “Little did he know..." I nearly taught a course on "Little did he know..." Harold shrugs.
29) 67) dialog: --Sonofabitch. Harold, “little did he know" means there's something he doesn't know. That means there’s something you don't know. That's... Christ... the voice is literally in 3rd person. Did you know that?
29) 69) dialog: Harold. I want you to come back on Tuesday. No. You could be dead by Tuesday. Come back tomorrow. At 1:30.
29) 73) dialog: It's been a very revealing five seconds, Harold.
29) 75) dialog: Good. Good. Listen. If the voice returns, don't resist it. But don't provoke it. And it's probably wise to avoid starting sentences with "This is the last time I dot dot dot"... Hilbert winks at him.
29) 76) dialog: I'll see you tomorrow.
35) 0) text: Professor Hilbert, a book open in his hands, opens his do and lets Harold in, The office is much the same. (CONTINUED)
35) 2) dialog: Mr. Crick, come in come in... Please. How are you?
35) 4) dialog: Good. Great. Count the tiles outside?
35) 6) dialog: (also lying} Of course not. He jumps from his seat grabs a notebook and pen and a pai of bifocals. He quickly pours himself a cup of coffee.
35) 7) dialog: I've devised a test-~- how exciting is that!-- with around 23 questions that I think might help uncover more truths about this narrator. Now, these may seem silly, but your candor is paramount.
35) 9) dialog: Good. So... we know it's a woman's voice, the story involves your death, it's modern, it's in English and I'm assuming the author has a cursory knowledge of the city.
35) 11) dialog: Good. Okay, question 1: Has anyone recently left any gifts outside your home... anything: gum, money... a large wooden horse?
35) 13) dialog: Harold, just answer the question.
35) 16) dialog: Good. Do you find yourself inclined . te solve murder mysteries in large, luxurious homes to which you may or May not have been invited?
35) 18) dialog: Okay. On a scale of one to ten, what would you consider to be the ‘likelihood you might be assassinated.
35) 20) dialog: One being very unlikely, ten being expecting it at every corner.
35) 22) dialog: Perhaps, let me re-phrase this. Are you the King of anything?
35) 24) dialog: Anything. King of the Lanes at the local bowling alley.
35) 26) dialog: King of the Lanes? King of the Trolls? A clandestine land found underneath your floorboards? Anything?
35) 28) dialog: Agreed. But let's start at ridiculous and move backwards. Now... was any part of you now at one time part of something else.
35) 30) dialog: Well, is it possible that you were at one time made of stone, wood, lye, varied corpse parts or earth made holy by rabbinical elders? (CONTINUED)
35) 33) dialog: Nothing. That's the point.
35) 35) dialog: Harold. The only way to find out what story you're in is to determine what stories you're not in. Odd as it may seem, I've just ruled out half of Greek literature, seven fairy tales, ten Chinese fables, and determined conclusively you are not King Hamlet, Scout Finch, Ms. Marple, Frankenstein's monster or a golem. (pause) Aren't you relieved to know you're not a golem?
35) 37) dialog: Good. Then just answer the questions... A SCREECH of tires and suddenly And You Will Know Us By T Trail of Dead (track 4 on your cd) begins to play...
38) 1) dialog: Okay. We're almost done, Harold. Just a few more. (pause) Do you subscribe to any belief system?
38) 3) dialog: Sure.
38) 5) dialog: Alright. What's your most favorite word?
38) 7) dialog: Good. Good. Do you aspire to anything: conquer Russia, win a whistling contest... anything?
38) 10) dialog: Harold. You must have some ambition.
38) 12) dialog: Some underlying dream...? Think Harold.
38) 15) dialog: Okay. That counts. Good. Very good. {pause) Last one: What's your secret? Harold looks at him.
38) 17) dialog: Yes. What is it about you that no one but you knows? Harold thinks for a moment.
38) 19) dialog: Harold. That's not a secret. It's absolutely obvious you count things. Why do you count things? Harold takes a deep breath.
38) 21) dialog: Okay. We're done. Excellent. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
38) 23) dialog: I think the next step is to determine conclusively if you're in a comedy or a tragedy. To quote Italo Calvino, "The ultimate meaning to which all stories refer has two faces: the continuity of life, the inevitability of death.”
38) 25) dialog: Tragedy you die. Comedy you get hitched.
38) 27) dialog: What's wrong?
38) 29) dialog: Well... most comic heroes fall in love with people who are introduced after the story has begun, usually people who hate the hero initially, although I can't imagine anyone hating you.
38) 31) dialog: Not dislikes you. Hates you. Detests you. Loathes the very core of you. Anybody like that? Harold thinks.
38) 33) dialog: Well, that sounds like a comedy... try to develop that plot.
38) 35) dialog: There's no real approach. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
38) 37) dialog: Except... well, if push comes to shove... ask her to talk about the past. Harold looks at his watch.
38) 39) dialog: Alright. Take care. Call me if the ‘plot twists. :
42) 6) text: A locker closes, revealing Professor Hilbert.
42) 7) dialog: Well the first thing is don't get on any trains. Harold stands in a suit, carrying a briefcase next to OTH SWIMMERS who dry off from the showers. We can see that Professor Hilbert is wearing a neon green Speedo cap, wit orange goggles and a pair of really tight purple Speedo shorts. Hilbert. locks a combination lock and tosses a to around his shoulders.
42) 8) dialog: Any idea who "Carla" and "the boy on the bicycle" are?
42) 10) dialog: Maybe. Maybe. Fantastic. They begin to walk past the lockers and around a corner. Past the coach's office where Hilbert takes a whistle off hook.
42) 12) dialog: I know. It's great.
42) 14) dialog: You proved something else entirely. The voice seems to be dependent on actions you take. You say the voice arrives when you do certain things, then stops when you don't do those things. It may be that you yourself are perpetuating this story.
42) 16) dialog: So I suggest we try something else.
42) 19) dialog: Forget her.
42) 21) dialog: Harold, if you want to stay alive, you have to try something else.
42) 23) dialog: Nothing.
42) 25) dialog: See... some plots are moved forward by external events or crisis... others are moved forward by the characters themselves. He points to the door.
42) 26) dialog: If I go through that door that plot continues. The story of me through the door. If I stay here... that plot can't move forward, the story ends. (pause) Also, if I stay here, I'm late. Hilbert goes through the door. Harold follows.
42) 28) dialog: Harold. Don't do anything tomorrow.
42) 30) dialog: Stay home. Don't answer the phone. Don't open the door. Don't brush your teeth.
42) 32) dialog: Call them tonight. Tell them you're not coming. (CONTINUED)
42) 35) dialog: Don't do anything that may move the plot forward. Instead, let's see if the pilot finds you. He puts his nose plugs in and climbs up to the lifeguard' chair. Harold is left standing.
51) 0) text: Professor Hilbert addresses his class until he is interru by Harold who just barges in. Harold is a complete mess and carries two suit cases on e side of him.
51) 2) dialog: Holy crapping hell. (CONTINUED)
51) 5) dialog: Meeting an insurance agent the day your policy runs out is coincidence. Getting a letter from the Emperor saying he's visiting is plot. (pause) A wrecking ball... is something else entirely. Hilbert's class writes this down emphatically. cur TO:
52) 0) text: Harold and Professor Hilbert stand in the hallways, conti their conversation. Hilbert takes a big, deep breath.
52) 1) dialog: (pause) You don't control your fate, Harold.
52) 3) dialog: It's... Harold... let's: This is a last ditch effort but it's possible, I mean-- do you still have the journal of things the narrator says?
52) 5) dialog: Well, it's possible, through analysis of sentence structure and some extensive vernacular profiling, I could conceivably figure out who's writing this story.
52) 7) dialog: And maybe, possibly, you could ask her to stop... but I can't make any guarantees.
52) 10) dialog: No. You-- Harold. {pause} You were right. This narrator might very well kill you.
52) 12) dialog: So, I humbly suggest that you forget this and just go live your life. . HAROLD . Go live my life? I am living my life... I'd like to continue living my life.
52) 13) dialog: Of course. I know. But I mean all of it. However long you have left... you can, Harold, you can use it to have an adventure, or discover something, or, or, or finish reading Crime and Punishment... hell, Harold, you could just eat nothing but pancakes if you wanted.
52) 15) dialog: Harold, if you'd pause to think I believe you'd realize that that answer is inextricably contingent upon the type of life being led. {pause) And, of course, the quality of the pancakes. They look at each other. Harold opens his case and hands Professor Hilbert his pad.
52) 16) dialog: Do you understand what I'm saying?
52) 18) dialog: Absolutely. So go make it the one you've always wanted. This finally lands with Harold. 63.
75) 0) text: Harold comes into Professor Hilbert's office without knoc interrupting Hilbert in the middle of standing and readin
75) 1) dialog: Harold?
75) 4) dialog: What?
75) 6) dialog: She has?
75) 8) dialog: That's... Harold that's wonderful. It completely nullifies my list but... Harold, that's fantastic.
75) 10) dialog: Oh. He hands Harold the list.
75) 11) dialog: These are the seven living authors whose prior work would seem to make them likely candidates to write your story, based on the criteria you and I have already determined. If your narrator is alive... she's on this list.
75) 14) dialog: But it appears the list is of little use to you now. HAROLD. I suppose. Although I can hang on to it--
75) 15) dialog: Hold on a minute... Hilbert turns up the volume on the television. Perhaps to our surprise, one of the dour women is in fact Kay, who s in a black: Donna Karan suit across from a very smarmy-lo ANCHORWOMAN with short, sensible hair. The interview is obviously years old and Kay is much healthier.
75) 16) dialog: Oh. Just a rerun. This woman: Karen Eiffel... one of my favorite authors... beautiful tragedies... just beautiful. Watch.
75) 30) dialog: What?
75) 32) dialog: Harold. Harold. Are you sure?
75) 34) dialog: (pause) Oh no...
75) 36) dialog: First of all, she wasn't on my list.
75) 38) dialog: And she... She doesn't... (pause) Harold. She kills people. Harold just looks at him.
75) 41) dialog: In every book. She... The books are all about... They die. She kilis them. .
75) 43) dialog: The heroes. Harold quickly looks...
75) 45) dialog: Harold. I... she's untraceable. I've... believe me. I used to teach a class on her work. .I've written her letters. She's a hermit. A recluse. I mean... she hasn't published anything in ten years. Harold goes to Hilbert's stacks and finds one of the many copies of Kay's books and opens it up to the copyright pa He grabs a pencil and a document from Hilbert's desk.
75) 47) dialog: No. Harold you-- Harold ignores him and begins to write anyway, mumbling t himself.
75) 49) dialog: Harold, even if you find--
75) 51) dialog: Harold, listen, she only--
75) 53) dialog: Harold--
75) 56) dialog: (Harold can't hear...) Harold. She only writes tragedies.
89) 0) text: Young coed swimmers spin upside down in the pool as the C and Professor Hilbert look on. Harold comes rushing into the pool with a manuscript, com with yellow pages.
89) 1) dialog: Harold? Did you find her?
89) 3) dialog: And?
89) 5) dialog: (Shit...] Hilbert points to the manuscript.
89) 6) dialog: Is that it?
89) 8) dialog: Did you...
89) 11) dialog: Okay. Harold hands it to him.
92) 0) text: Professor Hilbert places the manuscript down on his dinin room table. He sits down, removes his glasses, pulls out shammy from a glasses cleaning kit and begins to thorough clean his glasses. Upon finishing, he stands, holds the glasses in front of himself, turns the first page and begins to read.
95) 0) text: Harold knocks on the office door, then opens it slightly. Professor Hilbert sits behind his desk, calm and reticent He looks up. mo
95) 1) dialog: Hi, Harold. Come in. Harold comes in. He takes his usual seat on the couch. Professor Hilbert just stares at his desk for a moment. H is eerily calm.
95) 2) dialog: You look tired.
95) 4) dialog: Yes. Why? Do I seem sluggish?
95) 6) dialog: Yes... Well... (long pause) Harold. I'm sorry. (pause) You have to die.
95) 8) dialog: I'm sorry, but it’s brilliant, Harold. It's... It's her masterpiece.
95) 10) dialog: It's possibly the most important novel in her already stunning career. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
95) 13) dialog: Harold. You don’t understand--
95) 15) dialog: I've been over it again and again. And I know... I know how hard this
95) 18) dialog: Yes.
95) 20) dialog: I'm sorry Harold. Harold can't hold it in any longer. He begins to weep.
95) 22) dialog: Harold...
95) 24) dialog: Harold. It wouldn't matter.
95) 26) dialog: No.
95) 32) text: (pause) I can't die now I'm just starting to... I, I can't... it's... it's, it's just... (pause) It's really bad timing. Professor Hilbert comes over to comfort him.
95) 33) dialog: No'one wants to die Harold. But unfortunately, we can't avoid it. Harold. Harold, listen to me: You will die, someday... sometime. Heart failure at the bank, choke on a mint, some long, drawn out disease you contracted on vacation. You will die. You will absolutely die. Even if you avoid this death... another will find you. And I guarantee it won't be nearly as poetic or meaningful as what she's written.
95) 35) dialog: Harold: I'm sorry. (pause) It's the nature of all tragedy, Harold. The hero dies, but the story lives on forever. Harold tries to breath, his eyes red, his face streaked w tears.

114) 4) dialog: I... uh... uh... yes...
114) 7) dialog: Please... please... sit down.
114) 9) dialog: Is this...?
114) 11) dialog: Oh... So... you finished it? Typed it and everything?

116) 0) text: Professor Hilbert finishes the manuscript. He puts it down on the couch next to him.
116) 1) dialog: (pause) It's... It's okay. She turns to him. Kay It's not great.
116) 2) dialog: No. But... it's okay. It's not bad. Not the most amazing piece of American literature in several years but... it's okay.
116) 6) dialog: It doesn't make any sense with the rest of the book though.
116) 8) dialog: Why?
116) 10) dialog: Why did you change it?
116) 12) dialog: Because he's real?
116) 16) dialog: It's okay. Thank you for your novels. The two just look at each other awkwardly for a moment.
116) 18) dialog: Yes. Wo. I mean... I can't. TI quit.
116) 20) dialog: Yes. Why? Do I seem sluggish?
116) 22) dialog: When did you quit?
116) 24) dialog: Ah... They smile at each other.
116) 25) dialog: How about something else...?
116) 27) dialog: I don't know. Seems like a good opportunity to start a new routine.
