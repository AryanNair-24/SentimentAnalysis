Miss Pilbow closes the window. Satisfied that all is well, Big Nurse turns on an old 45 record player with a stack of records, then she settles d to her work as a SOFT, NOSTALGIC NUMBER from the '40's is HEARD OVER LOUDSPEAKER. CAMERA BEGINS SLOW PAN of the Day Room. The patients, under the influence of drugs, have settled for the day. HARDING is playing cards with MARTINI, CHESW and BILLY.

14) 19) dialog: Martini, it's your turn! Martini is staring off into space.
14) 20) dialog: Martini!
14) 43) dialog: Does he have an appointment?
14) 47) dialog: I'm a busy man!
14) 50) dialog: (to McMurphy) What are you doing?
14) 52) dialog: Your turn, Martini! Martini is lost in the clouds.
14) 53) dialog: Martini, throw a card! Martini throws a diamond.
14) 54) dialog: No, throw a club!
14) 56) dialog: Don't you have any clubs?
14) 58) dialog: Let me see your hand!
14) 60) dialog: (slamming his cards) Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to. Harding gets up and crosses to the hallway, gathering his pride as he goes. McMurphy slides into Harding's seat and rakes all the car in.
17) 6) dialog: Yes, that's perfectly correct.
17) 22) dialog: Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
17) 24) dialog: No, Miss Ratched...
17) 26) dialog: Yes, that is correct.
17) 28) dialog: I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
17) 30) dialog: Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
17) 33) dialog: The point is, I will carry on until I fully understand what the function of that relationship is regardless of form or content. Several hands go up.
17) 37) dialog: That's a matter of opinion.
17) 40) dialog: (smarting) Is that your sense of humor or are you trying to say something?
17) 42) dialog: I don't know. I don't know, but it makes me feel very peculiar when you throw in something like that.
17) 47) dialog: I hesitate to go on.
17) 49) dialog: I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
17) 50) dialog: (his voice rising as he goes on) ... or making me aware of a condition in my life, then I say, categorically speaking, the hell with you, Taber! I don't have to justify the condition of my life to you or any of you. No matter what I will carry on until I fully understand what that function is regardless of the form or content. Regardless of the fact we must try to understand the function of our capacity to obtain, to personify the condition, the condition of our existence, our existence...
18) 6) dialog: A pecking party?
18) 8) dialog: Who? Who?
18) 10) dialog: It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
18) 12) dialog: Did to me?
18) 18) dialog: Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
18) 26) dialog: Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
18) 28) dialog: And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
18) 30) dialog: Lobotomy!
18) 32) dialog: (pointing to lobotomy case) That! McMurphy looks.
18) 35) dialog: Now, what would I be trying to say? Martini and Scanlon rush over and try to get the ball.

21) 18) dialog: Why didn't you tell her to go to hell, lover boy?
21) 21) dialog: I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
21) 23) dialog: She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady. The men look at Big Nurse. The patients look at the nurses' station.
29) 39) dialog: Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function... (he stops, chews his lip, then continues) Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...

30) 23) dialog: And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
30) 36) dialog: You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
30) 38) dialog: With your own two hands?
30) 50) dialog: Twenty-five dollars.

35) 3) dialog: He can't hear you!
35) 5) dialog: So why are you talking to him?
35) 7) dialog: It doesn't help him.
35) 9) dialog: Well, I think you're just confusing him... Bromden jumps.
39) 27) dialog: What for?
39) 29) dialog: That's nice. Send me a post card. Harding turns his back to McMurphy.
