NEAR A WALL AT THE CHURCH: a GROUP OF OLDER MEN, standing and WOMEN, seated, with their children. With umbrellas ab their heads, fans in hand. NINA is here, holding JACK, NO AGE 3. IRISH BAGPIPES and DRUMS are playing; children are dancing. LORD BERNARD is here, standing near NINA. ANGLE ON: a HUNT LEADER, late forties.

Oh no, Mr. Bryce--I've been quite busy training ancient militia men to point their rifles at tree stumps. So--no medals for me.” He sits down near her. She sits on his lap, KISSES him. Then she leans back.
6) 14) dialog: The last man here upon whom we might possibly rely for advancement.
6) 16) dialog: (more serious now) I’m getting older, Cheeky. And very impatient of lost years. I know the tokens are ridiculous. I do. But I think of our boy--we cannot close any doors to him.
7) 22) dialog: Well, I am dancing with you. So I’ve got the better of the bargain. An OLDER OFFICER, THOMAS FRANCIS BUSBY, cuts in:

8) 1) dialog: Each can contain no more than twelve shells, Corporal...
8) 3) dialog: We lead the men--we don’t beat them into submission! The Officer registers this, his head sinking in shame. A SOLDIER drops a shell; they holler in caution at one another. Then an OFFICER BARKS from behind:

10) 8) dialog: No they did not, sir. I was likely consumed with my studies at the time.
10) 10) dialog: Yes. I’ve served in Ceylon, and in Hong Kong as well. I’ve...not stayed in one place for very long. Goldie looks down at a stack of papers. Keltie speaks up:
10) 15) dialog: Sir, my record speaks for itself. No one can question my commitment to King and country.
10) 17) dialog: My experience in the Orient taught me that no religion is higher than truth. I make no apologies. A pregnant pause. Then Goldie leans forward:
10) 19) dialog: In South America, sir?
10) 21) dialog: Only what I’ve read. Goldie chuckles. An atlas is put in front of Fawcett.
10) 23) dialog: I do, sir. But with respect--I’m not sure what it has to do with me. Sir.
10) 26) dialog: Sirs--to be honest, my survey work was long ago. And I was...I was really hoping for a posting where I might be able to see a fair bit of action.

12) 14) dialog: Darling, I'm afraid it’s no place for children.
12) 16) dialog: Because there’s great danger.
12) 18) dialog: We must all do our duty for King and country, first and foremost.
12) 20) dialog: Well...this is how we keep the world civilized.
12) 22) dialog: Goodbye, darling.
12) 24) dialog: Perhaps someday you will. I love you most deeply. Nina enters from behind them.

14) 3) dialog: I should think twice if I were you. The PICKPOCKET simply withdraws his hand. A BIG FIGHT bre out between two DRUNKS in the game. Fawcett turns to look ANOTHER MAN, clutching a rifle, standing with his arm aro a woman who might well be a prostitute, catches Fawcett’s eye. The Man takes a SWIG from a FLASK. Fawcett goes back to his reading...
16) 1) dialog: Who are you? He is CORPORAL HENRY COSTIN, twenties, with a bold Kiplingesque mustache and heavily-hooded eyes. Exceptiona fit, having been a gymnastics instructor in the Army.
16) 3) dialog: (incredulous; upset) We've been at sea a week--why in God’s name haven’t you revealed yourself until now?!
16) 7) dialog: You're speaking rather loudly, Mr. Costin.
16) 9) dialog: And what if I were?
16) 11) dialog: Too long in the tooth.
16) 13) dialog: I assumed as much--you’re carrying that ridiculous rifle. Fawcett backs up, puts away his knife. Said as a command: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) Where’s your paperwork. Costin reaches into his coat, pulls out a stack of paper, along with a small whiskey flask. And a small, tarnished medal with a ribbon. Fawcett looks at all of it.
16) 15) dialog: (as he looks at the papers) I myself have never been in war. Lost City of Z White 7/31/15 22.
16) 17) dialog: You've a family, Mr. Costin?
16) 19) dialog: Good. Nothing to shed.
16) 21) dialog: Yes. A wife and a boy, with another child on the way.
16) 23) dialog: Mr. Costin, my reputation as a man rests entirely on our success. You shall find me capable of every sacrifice.
16) 25) dialog: I’m certain you won't be disappointed. You’1ll need every last bit of fortitude you've got. Therefore, I must insist-- Fawcett takes Costin’s whiskey flask. PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) You’1l need no more Dutch courage. g As Fawcett pours it into a nearby sink in the pantry, sot PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) [It’s] destroyed many a fine man. The alcohol runs along the sink bottom. We MATCH CUT TO:
18) 2) dialog: We received a cable, in Asuncion. The political situation appears to have worsened and there’s been a change in plan. (to the map) We'll need to redirect our line of approach--our first priority must now be to map the Verde River and find its source. It forms a critical part of the border between Bolivia and Brazil.
18) 4) dialog: It is. (unfolds the map) Our survey route for the river would begin here, at, at--Fazienda Jacobina. Lost City of Z Green Revision Set 09/30/2015 23A.
18) 6) dialog: (looking at his telegram) We're to meet a Corporal Manley there. He’s contacted an Indian guide and hired the rest of our crew. (back to the map) We must chart our progress with as much survey detail as possible. Hopefully any mail from our loved ones will beat us to the spot. (as he folds the map) Time is of the essence. War is at stake and the environment will not be friendly. Costin battles the dog in the basket; it keeps sniffing h ear:
18) 8) dialog: (speechless for a moment; the odds ARE long; then:) Mr. Costin--we’re going to have to depend on each other. Because neither of us will survive this alone.
18) 10) dialog: It’s a poem. For our journey. Costin looks over at the book. CLOSE SHOT ON HANDWRITING ABOVE THE TEXT: “TO PERCY, WITH LOVE, NINA.” We TILT DOWN THE TEXT, and we HEAR: Lost City of Z Green Revision Set 09/30/2015 23B.

20) 4) dialog: (almost to himself) It’s even grander than one could have imagined... Stifling the briefest of smiles, Fawcett goes right back putting up a steely front. He starts going through his things. But he cannot hide his excitement. As he rummages PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) The manual insists we keep only the essentials now and live off the land, as best we can.
22) 0) text: Fawcett and Costin’s feet sink in mud; a bright YELLOW SN slithers around Fawcett’s feet. Costin’s eyes widen at th sight of it; Fawcett steps over it with studied calm... Sweat pours off their faces; terrible HEAT... SWARMING INSECTS... SAUBA ANTS... TICKS... CHIGGERS... Percy Fawcett BREATHES heavily but HACKS away with his machete. Costin is nearby, slightly ahead, HACKING AWAY a the JUNGLE. Occasionally, Fawcett stops to check a map, takes out his surveying equipment. He calls out:

Even though it’s merely a larg clearing, the stage is, oddly, MAGNIFICENTLY APPOINTED wi antiques from Old Europe. They're scattered about. Pathetic space, but you’d never know it listening to the singers and the orchestra. A smattering of people dressed the nines in the audience--wood benches in the middle of rainforest. In the back, Indians sit, quietly, listening to the music bizarre sight indeed. A DIMINUTIVE LATINO MAN dressed in tuxedo approaches Fawcett. In Portuguese:
24) 7) dialog: How do you do... This is Corporal Costin. Costin nods.
24) 9) dialog: Cancelled!? What on earth do you mean?!?
24) 11) dialog: Where is the government office?
24) 13) dialog: Then Mr. Manley, you send back a telegram--that we will not stand down and we shall proceed as planned! We will CONTINUE and see this through! Manley looks at him for a moment. PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) Are you WITH me, Corporal?
24) 21) dialog: Now what about an Indian guide--did * you get us a guide? * ANGLE ON MANLEY as he stops. He turns stone-faced.
24) 23) dialog: Well where is he? * A VOICE, in Portuguese, then English:
25) 3) dialog: Who are they?
25) 8) dialog: Who’s in charge here? Manley points to the HOUSE, on the HILL:
25) 11) dialog: He’s got the men we need. Fawcett takes several steps out, into the rain. To Manley PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) Bring the Indian up to the house. Tell them we’l1l pay.
26) 1) dialog: (smiles) * Baron, we're from the British Army. We're very sorry to interrupt your meal. We’re to be venturing down the Rio Verde as peacekeepers and will be in need of some of your men. No response from the Baron. PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) In exchange, I’m prepared to tell my government of your cooperation.
26) 3) dialog: Yes, we are.

26) 12) dialog: We are indeed. For surveying.
26) 14) dialog: Yes, we'd like very much to employ him.
26) 16) dialog: All the better I should take him off your hands, then. Tadjui, Fawcett exchange glares. Fawcett approaches Tadju PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) Do you speak English?

26) 23) dialog: No--
26) 27) dialog: Consider it your gift to the King.
26) 33) dialog: (to the others) Would you excuse me, please. Fawcett leads Costin outside:
27) 2) dialog: We'll hire as many of them as we can and set them free when we’re done. Fawcett starts to turn back; Costin stops him:
27) 4) dialog: No. As I say, we'll pay them and treat them as any other in our party. (beat) It’s the most we can do under the circumstances.
27) 6) dialog: Would your hands be any cleaner if we left them here to die? We’re the only hope they’ve got. We need them and we'll take them with us.
27) 11) dialog: (loses a bit of patience) To whom, Corporal? To WHOM? Have you taken a look around--do you see where we are? (beat) I promise you, their story shall not go untold if we survive. I promise you that. Costin realizes Fawcett is right. He steps forward, and swallowing his pride, he unslings his rifle. Muttering:
29) 6) dialog: Can you show me where we’re to pitch camp tonight? Tadjui traces his finger along the river on the map, then stops several inches into a blank area. HE TRACES THE SHA WITH HIS FINGER. SEEMS TO KNOW EVERY CURVE.

33) 3) dialog: It must be so. Fawcett takes the picture, looks at it.
33) 5) dialog: Thank you, Mr. Costin. He then POCKETS THE PHOTO. Costin eyes him. FAWCETT TAKES THE PHOTO OUT AGAIN. PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) The boy’s name is “Brian”.

36) 1) dialog: Come on, pull! Manley and the others help, with Tadjui looking on. Fawce finally succeeds in pulling Urquhart up, onto the raft. And he is DEAD. His lower half has been completely devour by the piranhas...

Fawcett’s face wrinkles in anguished recognition of his articles’ damage. HE COLLECTS HIS THIN

Hands one to Costin: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) We may be at the end now and I believe it’s time. (beat) I'm afraid it’s quite unbearable for me to read it myself. Would you please? Costin wordlessly takes it from Fawcett, staring at Fawce
38) 10) dialog: Feel free to summarize.
38) 17) dialog: I see my son’s face in my dreams now. (sotto) What a mistake to come here... He GRABS HIS HEAD, each palm of his hand on each side of head. Closes his eyes in ANGUISH. As Fawcett wipes tears from his face:

Manley is shivering terribly and covered w maggots; HE IS STICKING HIS TONGUE OUT, TO CATCH THE RAIN IT FALLS FOR HYDRATION. Dan is muttering to himself, alou he also sticks out his tongue for the rain’s water. Even dogs have gone totally lethargic, and the carcass of one them slides into the river. Willis rummages through the food baskets. Nothing but a couple of rotten fruit. He begins to cry:

40) 2) dialog: Prepare for the group photograph, Mr. Costin... Costin takes the camera and plants it on a TRIPOD for THE GROUP PHOTO, but he is so depleted he can barely move his limbs. The others weakly get into position for the photo. Dan weeps as he slides into his position. Lost City of Z Green Revision Set 09/30/2015 46. Manley looks around, then calls out:

FAWCETT holds his finger to his lips--"QUIET!” And then d into the brush. Costin approaches, sees something, or at least thinks he does. Turns to Manley, who is standing ne to him. Whispering:

Fawcett DUMPS a series of frayed map notebooks on t desk. He also EMPTIES HIS POCKETS OF POTTERY SHARDS. A BRITISH OFFICIAL ("SIMON BEAUCLERK”) with his back to us overhears this.

49) 8) dialog: I would hope the RGS continues its pursuits. But I believe mapmaking should be of secondary interest now. I witnessed many archeological sightings of great significance. Some guy interrupts MURRAY. He is WILLIAM BARCLAY, thirty one (more from him later):
49) 11) dialog: Sir John, my mind is perfectly fit-- and thank heavens, still open. Fawcett steps away from Keltie and eyes JAMES MURRAY, hol court. Others around him LAUGH at a joke we cannot HEAR. Then, re a painting behind him:

50) 1) dialog: Arrow drawings, meant to represent fractional distances, evidence of advanced mathematics. It’s incredible... (to Nina) I should have engaged the Indians more directly--they no doubt had a great deal to teach me. No response from Nina, who had been sifting through anoth set of old and frayed documents, letters, writings. She SEEMS TO HAVE STOPPED. Staring at one YELLOWED PIECE OF PAPER, for seconds on end.

51) 19) dialog: Perhaps it is too difficult for some of you to admit. We, who have been steeped in the bigotry of the Church for so long, cannot give much credence to an “older civilization”--particularly one created by a race the white man has so brutally condemned to slavery and death. YET WE MUST ENGAGE WITH
51) 24) dialog: HENCE your disrespect--but I ask you, what is at stake? If we may learn of a city where one was considered impossible to exist, it might well write a whole new chapter in human history. Man would be shown as a conqueror of his environment and not a slave to it! Outright BOOING now. Fawcett shouts over the boos: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) CONSIDER MY EVIDENCE! My sightings of statues and archeological finds! Fawcett HOLDS UP A PIECE OF POTTERY: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) Antiquities as sophisticated as any in Asia or Europe, in the middle of the jungle!

But Fawcett braves it nonetheless, holding a SURVEYING BOOK in front of his face to protect from the arrows. THWACK! An ARROW HITS the SURVEYING BOOK in front of his face!

Tell the men I’ve designed new rafts--the canoes are riddled with arrows and useless now. We’1ll be off on foot in the morning... Fawcett walks into the field of MAIZE. The wind blows the plants, and Fawcett is an incongruous figure amidst the Guarayos, who tend to the crops. Costin watches as Fawcett approaches the LEADER OF THE GUARAYOS and teaches him to HANDSHAKE. A GOODBYE OF SORTS

The others cannot wait and die with him. (beat) Do you understand? Murray seems to get it. An awkward beat, then: Murray sta to grip his revolver.

71) 3) dialog: I would like to congratulate you. On your safe return. (beat) A remarkable effort. No answer by Murray.
71) 5) dialog: No, it is not. He was sent back with both food and money. It was a necessary maneuver, in order to save lives.
71) 7) dialog: That’s absurd. We almost killed ourselves giving you what rations we could!
71) 9) dialog: Mr. Murray, you were the reason we did not reach our destination!

71) 25) dialog: Yes. I should apologize. (looks to Costin, Manley) To my crew. I’m sorry that I ever believed Mr. Murray to be worthy of your company. And that I ever mistook a man’s rank for his mettle. I shall not make that mistake again. Fawcett stands, walks toward the door.

77) 7) dialog: Gather up as many men as you can. Cooks and signallers as well. We'll go over the top at dawn.
77) 9) dialog: Those plans are absurd. We might all die if the Germans attack. Is that what you prefer? There is no other course open to us but to fight it out. (beat) There can be no retirement--our backs are against the wall. Prepare to go over the top. Any man who has not written to his loved ones should do so.
79) 6) dialog: Yes... I surely do. (to the Madame) We'll be in battle soon, madame. Any spiritual aid we can get--I think we’d all very much like your blessing.

She reaches over, takes an Indian NECKLACE that Fawcett has wrapped around hand like a bracelet. She slips it off. She looks up at the WALL, SEES THE JUNGLE ARTWORK. She begins to HYPNOTIZE THE ROOM.

81) 7) dialog: Our world has set itself afire...and we must look elsewhere to quench the blaze...
83) 1) dialog: When I was younger, I ventured all for King and Country, for place, and rank. I believed that to be the makings of a man. But my travels have taught me that such ambitions are mere phantoms. Phantoms that exclude humanity from the Garden of Eden. My dear friends, what DOES matter--the only thing that matters--is the esteem we show our fellow man. In our hearts we fight for our loved ones; as they are not here today, we fight for each other. (beat) Good luck and may God be with you.
84) 6) dialog: Come on! Come on! Come on!
86) 3) dialog: Let me kiss you all. Nina lifts the toddler Joan, and Fawcett kisses her. Fawc strokes the top of Brian’s head tenderly. PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) Joan, and Brian...where’s Jack?

86) 13) dialog: (beat) What about--what about my travels? To Amazonia? Nina cannot answer this. She looks to the Doctor:
86) 17) dialog: “Civilized”? That word is an obscenity. I’ve been years in that jungle, with so-called savages. And none would ever bring such horror and destruction on his fellow creatures. Percy turns away. Everyone takes the hint--Nina pats everyone out. But staying is JACK. Jack sits down ina chair against the wall. NINA TURNS to OBSERVE: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) (sotto voce) Jack...?

88) 1) dialog: I'm grateful for their interest. You may tell your readers I’ve recovered from my wounds and have adapted to home life. The family’s lived in many places--Jamaica, also in America, briefly. We've only just returned to England.
88) 3) dialog: Yes--my family’s needs are above all now. AMERICAN MAN’S VOICE (0.C.) But your pursuits in South America led to tremendous interest in exploration in the United States. There have been many new voyages planned. Percy Fawcett perks up. NEW voyages?

89) 16) dialog: I am touched by your faith in me. But--the war took its toll.
89) 18) dialog: On this, Jack, we must consult a higher authority. (beat) Your mother, I mean. Jack lets out a laugh. Then:
89) 20) dialog: You were only doing your best to protect all of us. (beat) The hero in you was speaking. Fawcett approaches Jack. Offers him a hand: Lost City of Z Pink Revision Set 8/24/15 106. PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) Come. We’ll conquer your mother’s reserve together...
90) 6) dialog: We’re not there yet, Jack. These journeys require a great deal of money and training.

90) 12) dialog: Yes...we shall see it through... I‘'1ll go see Mr. Costin. (beat; looks at her) You're concerned about Jack? She does not answer. PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) He'll perform splendidly. I've learned from the past that character is more important than experience. The CAMERA PANS to the WINDOW, to SEE JACK RUNNING. OUTSI IS YOUNG JOAN, playing. Fawcett watches them both, then: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) The boy has what it takes, I’m sure.
91) 2) dialog: Can I truly not persuade you to come with us? Costin averts Percy’s gaze. Percy leans forward. Whispering: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) We were so close before--and think of what it would mean, for all human history.
91) 4) dialog: I would remind you that when we went on our travels, my own children were younger than yours are now. (leans back, subtly introspective) I did have my fair share of concern about their welfare, it’s true. (leans forward again, louder) Yet my son today--if you were to see his character, his vim and vigor, for yourself, it would tear down your resistance in an instant. A WAITER comes over:
91) 7) dialog: (surprised) You doubt its existence.
91) 15) dialog: You feel I romanticize the significance of 2. Costin begins to protest. Fawcett stops him: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) The charge does not dismay me. But let the world stand in judgement once I knock the scales from their eyes. Do not doubt me, my friend. Costin breaks out into a huge smile.

92) 2) dialog: This will be no pampered expedition. Top-heavy missions get nowhere; they linger on the fringe of civilization and bask in publicity. We will not. Our journey will last three years. A tribesman will take our messages to bring them to you as often as we can, for you to publish.
92) 6) dialog: The money is generously being supplied by a consortium of American newspapers and Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr.
92) 8) dialog: I am glad to see our nation is not to be left behind.

Awkward silence as Nina begins to turn inward. PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) Well, I suppose that’s all. I/’11 send you the dispatches, for the newspapers.
94) 4) dialog: Cheeky, if I should not come back-- do not look for me. If one of us lives, we all shall live.
94) 6) dialog: You're a man now, responsible for your mother and sister’s care. It’s a fine calling, no less and perhaps more virtuous than ours. No response. Percy Fawcett takes out a sealed LETTER.
94) 9) dialog: I’ve written something for you. Brian takes it. Fawcett kisses Joan: PERCY FAWCETT (CONT’D) Dear Joan. Take care of your mother.
94) 11) dialog: On to Z, then. And a new history. Fawcett then leans over, kisses Nina briefly, and unsentimentally boards the truck. Jack hugs Nina, who the turns and gets in the truck as well.
