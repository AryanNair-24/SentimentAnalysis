38) 18) dialog: Major--I’m not one for speeches. And if I should die here, I know my name dies with me. But I have fought as a soldier, and I have tasted victory. What have you tasted--besides your unrealized dreams? If you allow yourself to perish here, you will have achieved nothing. Now that my fever has come on, I may well not survive. Indeed, I am of little use in my current state. But you must persevere. (a sardonic smile) And may I add, if you should manage to take me with you, I’1l not protest.
