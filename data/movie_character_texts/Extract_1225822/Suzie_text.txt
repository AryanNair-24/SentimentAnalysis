6) 8) dialog: We gotta get a new pool cleaner.I don't think that asshole checked the chlorine levels again like I asked him too... Joel puts his arm around her, caresses her shoulder. She doesn't seem to notice as he starts getting fresh.

I had to work hard, get a career going, take Suzie out a bunch of times, marry her. But not Brad. He gets to waltz into my house and have sex with my wife just like that. Oh, and by the way? That little prick was at my house again today. DEAN

55) 6) text: What do you think I mean?... Did he do a good job cleaning the pool? SUZIE
55) 8) text: Did he get all the... leaves? It doesn't really look that clean. I mean I'm looking at it, and I'd say it's pretty goddamn filthy. Did the guy even clean it at all? It sure doesn't look like it. SUZIE (NERVOUS)
55) 10) text: I think he did a horrible job. I don't think we should use him anymore. SUZIE

60) 8) text: Why? SUZIE
60) 9) text: Because of all the things I just said. (MORE)     75 SUZIE (CONT'D) (PATIENTLY)
60) 11) text: Can I see you tomorrow? SUZIE
60) 13) text: How about next week? SUZIE
60) 15) text: I'll call you tomorrow. SUZIE

68) 1) text: Listen Joel, there's something I have to tell you. I think we need to be honest with each other. Suzie sits down.    
68) 4) text: You banged the pool cleaner. SUZIE
68) 5) text: Wha... Suzie is stunned. JOEL
68) 6) text: That's what you're trying to tell me right? You had sex with Brad? SUZIE
68) 8) text: Yes I knew. I hired him. SUZIE
68) 10) text: I don't mean I hired him to clean the pool, I mean I hired him to have sex with you. SUZIE

68) 18) text: I only paid him once -- well, twice. The rest was on the house. Long beat as Suzie tries to let it all sink in. SUZIE
68) 20) text: Yes. But I didn't. Suzie paces around for a moment, reeling, processing all this. Then, decisively, SUZIE
68) 22) text: Oh, I'm the asshole? SUZIE
68) 24) text: How could I? How could you?!!! You didn't have to have sex with him. You could've simply said "No thanks. Just clean the pool," but you didn't, did you?! No, you took him up on his little offer and had sex with him -- fifteen times! SUZIE
68) 27) text: Okay. I'll admit, I made a big mistake. I was drunk, on drugs, stressed, sexually frustrated and I shouldn't have hired a male prostitute to seduce you. But if you had simply been faithful, none of this would've happened. Suzie just looks at him for a beat. SUZIE
68) 29) text: What do you see in Brad anyway? He's borderline retarded. You probably could've been arrested for having sex with a guy that dumb. SUZIE
68) 30) text: That's it. I'm leaving. Suzie heads for the door. Joel follows after her. JOEL
68) 31) text: No. You're not leaving me. I'm leaving you! SUZIE
68) 33) text: Oh, hey guys. Glad I caught ya. You guys hardly ever answer the door. Heh heh. They are both so flustered, they can barely talk. SUZIE
68) 38) text: Well, you think I could go ahead and get that check from ya then? I'm just trying to balance my checkbook here... SUZIE
68) 40) text: When would be a good time, you think? SUZIE
68) 42) text: See the thing is-- SUZIE
68) 44) text: Great, what time? SUZIE
68) 46) text: Okay great. And if you could just go ahead and have that check, that'd be great. It's a hundred and ten. That's two plates at FIFTY-FIVE-- SUZIE
68) 47) text: Yeah, Okay... Suzie shuts the door, cutting him off.
70) 3) text: I just wanted to tell you, I'm not gonna see Suzie anymore. You don't have to worry. Joel keeps drinking his beer, stares straight ahead. BRAD
70) 5) text: Why'd you have to get hung up on Suzie? You could have any girl you want. BRAD
70) 6) text: Yeah, but I want Suzie. And I can't have her. JOEL

72) 6) text: Boy, you just can't get good help, eh? SUZIE
72) 8) text: So, did you get a chance to write that check? SUZIE
72) 10) text: Well gee, I wish you would've told me that before I went and bought the tickets. SUZIE
72) 12) text: Well, it sure sounded like you guys were going. Leslie was gonna talk to you about it, but you didn't return our calls. I mean, I already bought these tickets. They're nonrefundable. I really wish you guys had been a little more clear with me... It's the last straw. Suzie has had enough. She unleashes all her pent-up aggression on Nathan. SUZIE
72) 16) text: Shut up! In fact, let me be even more clear with you. We don't like you! Is that clear enough? You're dull, you never shut up, you never listen, and we don't want anything to do with you ever again! Nathan freezes, in some kind of state of shock. He starts shake a little. Suzie just keeps going -- it feels too go to stop. SUZIE
72) 17) text: Is that clear enough for you Nathan?! Is that...? Nathan starts to go into some kind of seizure. SUZIE (WORRIED)
72) 18) text: Nathan? Nathan's eyes roll back into his head, and he collapses. Suzie SCREAMS.
81) 0) text: We are CLOSE ON NATHAN, in a coffin, embalmed. We PULL OU to see mourners lined up, taking a last look at the body. Joel is among them. He looks down at Nathan for a moment then continues to his seat. A few rows back, we see SUZIE sitting by herself, dressed in black.

83) 8) text: It's okay, it's not your fault... It's not your fault. Suzie's crying subsides a little. SUZIE
83) 10) text: Yeah, I know... I know... But we probably won't. It'll be alright. Suzie starts to regain her composure. They stand there for a beat. JOEL
83) 11) text: You wanna go get something to eat... or something? Beat. Suzie still sniffling a little. SUZIE
83) 14) text: Here... SUZIE
83) 16) text: Maybe we should've been married in a Church like that one. Instead of the Botanical Gardens. SUZIE
83) 18) text: Yeah, but... a church just seems more -- I don't know -- official. SUZIE
83) 20) text: I don't know... So, are we still married? SUZIE
83) 22) text: I mean otherwise. SUZIE
83) 25) text: You know, this is really bad, but... Oh never mind. SUZIE
83) 28) text: Well, as I was looking down at Nathan there, I was thinking... That's the longest I've ever seen him with his mouth shut. Suzie LAUGHS in spite of herself. SUZIE
