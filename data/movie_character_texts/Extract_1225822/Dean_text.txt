9) 0) text: Joel sits at the bar. DEAN, the owner of the bar, late forties, and an old friend of Joel's, sits behind the bar a stool.
9) 2) dialog: Why don't you do that in another bathroom. You've got three of 'em.
9) 4) dialog: Insulation?... All I know is, you shouldn't move man; you've got a nice house. I mean you've got the American dream really -- you own your own company. I can't believe you used to bar back for me here, and now you've got all that.
9) 13) dialog: (trying to help) Yeah, but he probably lives in a crappy apartment.
16) 0) text: Joel sits at the bar, on a cell phone. Dean sits behind t bar on a stool.
16) 9) dialog: (shaking his head) Wow...
16) 11) dialog: Well, you have insurance for that kind of thing, right?
16) 13) dialog: Yeah. I would think so. I mean, it's your balls... Beat, as they contemplate the profundity of it.
16) 15) dialog: Yeah. And your balls are really important man. Your balls are everything. What kind of life would you have with no testicles? Can you imagine that shit?
16) 25) dialog: Wait. Three months? I thought you said it was once a month.
16) 27) dialog: Well, I hope so. That would suck... I get laid all the time. (off Joel's reaction) Sorry.
16) 30) dialog: Yeah, sexual frustration is bad news... You know what you oughtta do?
16) 32) dialog: Get some Xanax.
16) 34) dialog: Yeah it is, but I find it's good for just about any phsychological problem. I mean, basically it just makes you feel good, so it sort of works for anything. I even take it when I have a cold. It's probably great for sexual frustration. Want me to get you some?
16) 41) dialog: You know what else is good? Codeine cough syrup.
16) 43) dialog: It's just good. Joel looks at Dean for a beat.
16) 45) dialog: No... Well, I guess I took some Vicodin this morning. But that was just 'cause I was hung-over.

21) 7) dialog: Damn! Who's she? Is she new?
21) 9) dialog: She's a tramp?
21) 11) dialog: Damn, she's hot! Way to go.
21) 13) dialog: Manpower, huh? Maybe I should give them a call. You don't usually have girls anywhere near that hot working here. What's the deal?
21) 15) dialog: (thinks for a second) Do they really?... Huh... You just don't see 'em here. Usually your temps look like winos. And they're guys.
21) 17) dialog: What?
21) 24) dialog: No way! Really?
21) 26) dialog: Hey, I'm sure she did. Are you kidding? You could have any girl down there.
21) 28) dialog: I'm serious. Dude, you're the big shot here. You're the king of... What do you call that shit you make here again?
21) 31) dialog: Yeah, you're the Extract King man. You could have any girl here. I mean, I wouldn't want most of 'em, but her... Way to go Joel. Dean looks down at manufacturing area, taking it all in.
21) 32) dialog: So how did she come on to you?
21) 34) dialog: Yeah.
21) 43) dialog: Really? How?
21) 46) dialog: Wow. So, you gonna do anything about it?
21) 48) dialog: (still staring at her) Man, she is fine. You mind if I hit that then? Beat.
27) 0) text: Joel sits at the bar talking to Dean. Joel is drinking so kind of hard liquor, getting a buzz.
27) 2) dialog: Huh...Now that you mention it, you guys kind of look alike too.
27) 5) dialog: Okay.
27) 7) dialog: What about that girl at work? She still into you?
27) 9) dialog: I've got some Xanax if you want it. Like I say, that always works for me.
27) 16) dialog: Well maybe you should call that girl.
27) 18) dialog: What about if Suzie cheated on you?
27) 21) dialog: You wish she would cheat on you? Wouldn't that bother you? Joel thinks about it.
27) 23) dialog: Yeah, it's a little weird. Sort of.
27) 25) dialog: Do you think she would cheat on you?
27) 27) dialog: You sure?
27) 35) dialog: So you're saying she would probably cheat on you if she was put in temptation's way?
27) 37) dialog: You know what you oughtta do?
27) 40) dialog: No, no. Check this out -- If you really wish your wife would cheat on you, it's not that hard to make it happen.
27) 42) dialog: Hire a gigolo to have an affair with your wife.
27) 44) dialog: I'm serious. I know a guy.
27) 47) dialog: Yeah.
27) 54) dialog: This guy Brad. He comes in here all the time. He's a friend of Vic's. You could hire him to have an affair with Suzie.
27) 56) dialog: Why not? You said you wouldn't care if she cheated on you. Then you'd be free to go out with that Cindy chick and get your ya-yas out -- with no guilt. Problem solved. (proud of himself) Man, what a great idea. Joel just shakes his head at the whole thing.
29) 0) text: Joel is starting to look really tweaked as the drug-alcoh combination begins to kick in. Dean is examining a pill under the cash register light, trying to read the small print. He looks concerned.
29) 6) dialog: Shit... Do you remember what color that pill I gave you was?
29) 8) dialog: Damn. I don't think it was Xanax. I think that might've been Ritalin... Or "Special K."
29) 10) dialog: It's just that, ah, Special K is a horse tranquilizer, kinda has a weird effect when people take it but... well, don't worry about it... You might not want to drink too much more though.
29) 13) dialog: Yeah?
29) 15) dialog: (with full authority) Oh nooo. Definitely not. What could be morally wrong about it?
29) 17) dialog: Look, if she doesn't want to go for it, she doesn't have to. And if she does, then she's the one who sinned, and then it's perfectly morally right for you to go out and boff whoever you want.
29) 26) dialog: Brad. You want me to give him a call?
29) 28) dialog: Look, this is no big deal Joel. I'm serious.
29) 30) dialog: Yeah. I mean, you can't lose. Just say you're hiring him to come clean the pool or something. See what happens. If she doesn't go for it, then at least you know you're doing the right thing by being faithful.
29) 32) dialog: Look. Have another drink. Think about it... You know what? Why don't I just call Brad and see what he has to say?
30) 0) text: Dean and Joel are talking with BRAD, the gigolo. He's you blonde, super good-looking, but clearly a complete airhea Joel looks really messed up now.
30) 3) dialog: Well yeah, but don't forget, I'm getting ten percent.
30) 5) dialog: 
30) 9) dialog: Two-hundred and twenty.
30) 34) dialog: Referrals.
30) 36) dialog: Networking.
31) 0) text: Joel and Dean are at Dean's car, trying to say goodbye to Brad, who still won't shut up.
31) 7) dialog: Okay, you've said that a few times now Brad. Go on to your car. Okay?
31) 9) dialog: Goodnight Brad.
31) 11) dialog: Let me drive you home. You're in no condition to drive. Joel stumbles into Dean's car.
31) 13) dialog: Oh no. He does it all the time. Don't worry. He just gets a little excited sometimes. He's cool.
31) 15) dialog: Yeah well, what do you excpect? He's a whore.
33) 0) text: Joel grabs the phone and dials frantically. Dean answers.
33) 5) dialog: Ah, yeah. As far as I know.
33) 7) dialog: Okay...
33) 14) dialog: Sure, I'll call him. No problem... Oh wait a second. I don't think I have his number.
33) 16) dialog: Yeah, but I got his number from Vic.
33) 18) dialog: Vic doesn't have a phone right now.
33) 20) dialog: Hmm... it's something like,... I think it's a Mexican name.
33) 23) dialog: Yeah, I thought it was weird too -- a guy like that with a Mexican last name... It's like Lopez, or Sanchez or something. Joel looks at his watch. It's 11:15.
49) 0) text: Joel sits at the bar talking to Dean, drinking a beer. JOEL
49) 1) text: I can't believe my wife slept with that guy. DEAN
49) 3) text: I guess I didn't really think about it long enough... I just wish it hadn't been so easy for him. DEAN
49) 5) text: No, you're right. He may be a stupid, dull-witted moron, but he can get any girl he wants. Me, I had to work for it. I had to work hard, get a career going, take Suzie out a bunch of times, marry her. But not Brad. He gets to waltz into my house and have sex with my wife just like that. Oh, and by the way? That little prick was at my house again today. DEAN
49) 10) text: I'm not going to let him do it for free. No way. I'm paying him. DEAN
49) 12) text: Oh, I don't know. The same, I guess. Why? DEAN
49) 13) text: Hmm... So should I get my twenty dollars from Brad then or... Joel shoots Dean an angry look. DEAN (CONT'D)
49) 15) text: I don't know... I feel weird about it. Besides, she's at the party, she probably won't be home 'til late. DEAN
49) 17) text: (rolling his eyes) I don't wanna do drugs Dean. DEAN

50) 19) text: What? Long pause. DEAN
50) 20) text: Huh? Joel's POV: looking from Dean to Willie. Willie sits ther with red eyes barely open. Willie turns slowly to Joel. WILLIE
50) 30) text: Time for you to call her and finally get laid man! (handing him the phone) Come on! DEAN
50) 44) text: It's busy. DEAN
50) 58) text: Joel? What are you doing here...? Willie stands up and walks over to Joel's chair. Dean suddenly stands up. DEAN
50) 59) text: Well, it looks like you guys got a lot to talk about here so I think I'm just gonna go ahead and take off. Later guys. Dean bolts. Willie moves in closer on Joel. Joel starts t leave, but Willie blocks him. WILLIE
53) 31) text: Hello. DEAN
53) 33) text: Uh-huh. DEAN
53) 37) text: He did take a swing at me Dean. Several swings. In fact, he beat the living shit out of me. DEAN
