62) 1) text: .You see, if both his balls had been knocked clean off, he would be a good case, but not a great case: A man with no balls is no man at all. He's a freak. He's barely human. He's gross. And a jury will never feel like they can walk in the shoes of a ball-less, neutered, he/she freak. But Step. He's still got one ball - barely. He's still a man. A man who's very manhood has been jeopardized, but still a man. And that manhood, that very sense of what you are as a human being is hanging by a thread. Jesus, you can't get more dramatic than that. That brave ball, hanging on for dear life, hanging on for justice, is going to be the hero of this trial. I'm tellin' ya this Step guy is the fuckin' Holy Grail, the Powerball Jackpot. And you all laughed at me when I bought those bus bench ads. But I knew the asses of those poor slobs that sit on those benches and ride those sweaty, stinking, cattle cars are our future. And I -- Joel and Brian walk in. ADLER
71) 1) text: We're screwed. General Mills has pretty much withdrawn the offer pending a really favorable settlement with Step. (shaking his head) Not only do we not sell the company, we could wind up bankrupt. JOEL

79) 7) text: Well... that's good. They both sit down on the edge of the dock. STEP
79) 9) text: Wow... Bummer... STEP
79) 11) text: Yeah, he sure is. STEP
79) 13) text: Yeah... I'm beginning to think I might be the same way... I'm a little worried about what I'd do with too much time on my hands. STEP
79) 15) text: Yeah,... I think I do a lot worse. STEP
79) 20) text: Well, maybe I don't have to sell the company... You know I've been thinking; all these years I've been building this company, dreaming about the day I could sell it and retire, but what would I really do if I retired? It's like that old saying -- it's not about the destination, it's about the journey? Step just stares at him blankly, he lost him. JOEL
79) 21) text: I guess what I'm saying is, too much free time might not be such a good thing -- like that old saying, idle hands are the Devil's playground? Step's never heard that one either. STEP
79) 23) text: What I'm saying is, I'm thinking maybe I won't sell the company... STEP
79) 25) text: that is, if you dropped the lawsuit. -- and remember, you'll still get that insurance money -- probably a couple hundred thousand. What do you think? STEP

80) 8) text: You know, if Joel's going to put him in charge, we should go on strike. You know, at Gemco, the union handles the strikes and you don't even have to-- PULL OUT as Step cuts her off. STEP
80) 9) text: Quit yapping and get back to work or you're fired. Step walks off -- maybe pops a testosterone pill. Mary an Gabrielle keep muttering and shaking their heads. LONG PULL OUT as things get back to normal at the factory
