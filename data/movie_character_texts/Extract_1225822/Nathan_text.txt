4) 10) dialog: Hi there Joel! Glad I caught ya... Nathan settles in like he's going to be there a while, leaning with his arms folded, hanging inside the car, trapping Joel.
4) 11) dialog: How've ya been? I left you a message last week. I don't know if you got it or not.
4) 13) dialog: Oh yeah? You been busy?
4) 15) dialog: Well, real quick while I got ya here -- what're you guys doing November 17th?
4) 18) dialog: Oh yeah? Where you going?
4) 25) dialog: Oh, wait a minute -- I'm sorry, I meant the 7th. Yeah, November 7th. You'll be in town then right?
4) 28) dialog: Great. There's this dinner Leslie and I are going to. It's an annual thing -- we do it every year with the Rotary Club -- it's for charity. It's just a whole lot of fun, and we wanted to invite you and Suzie to be our guests at our table. It's--
4) 30) dialog: Really? Why not? It's a lot of fun.
4) 33) dialog: Why not?
4) 35) dialog: Oh no -- It's not like that. She won't be uncomfortable. I guarantee it. No, it's not like that at all. It's not formal or anything. Trust me. It's just a real loose bunch.
4) 42) dialog: I tell you what. Why don't we do this -- I'll go ahead and get tickets, since they're gonna sell out fast. You talk to Suzie. See what she says. Like I say, she won't be uncomfortable at all. Maybe I'll have Leslie give her a call -- you know how it is when the wives talk, heh heh-- Joel is about to snap.
5) 1) dialog: Sorry, I almost forgot -- the tickets are forty dollars a plate. I know that's a little steep, but the food is fantastic and it's for a good cause. So that'd be eighty dollars total. There's no tax or anything.
5) 8) dialog: Oh, and if you need us to look out for the house or anything when you go out of town -- Joel's finger still on the garage door button.
5) 9) dialog: Well, just let us know. Where you guys going anyway?
5) 12) dialog: Alright then. We'll see ya. Nathan finally steps out of the garage. Joel breaths a hu sigh of relief. Then,
5) 14) dialog: Oh, Joel one more thing-- Joel lets the door shut on him, and bolts into the house.
38) 9) dialog: How's it goin'?
38) 11) dialog: Yeah. Well I won't keep you. I just wanted to let you know, I got those tickets to that dinner we talked about on the 7th. I think I told you they were forty dollars a piece, but it turns out it's a tad more this year -- fifty-five -- so if I could go ahead and just get a check from you guys...
38) 13) dialog: No, this is the 7th. You said you're going out of town on the 17th.
38) 15) dialog: But I already bought the tickets. I know you said something about her feeling uncomfortable, but, like I say, she won't feel uncomfortable at all -- I guarantee it.
38) 22) text: Look, I gotta get going. NATHAN
38) 23) text: Alright then... Joel starts to pull away. NATHAN (CONT'D)
38) 24) text: Oh, one more thing -- Joel just keeps driving, almost knocking Nathan over.
45) 0) text: Joel pulls into the driveway and is STARTLED as he practically runs over Nathan, flagging him down. Joel MUTTERS obscenities as he reluctantly stops and roll down the window. NATHAN
45) 2) text: Hi. I can't talk right now-- NATHAN
45) 5) text: Look Nathan, I gotta... Wait, you mean yesterday, don't you? NATHAN
45) 7) text: The new pool cleaner. You saw him yesterday right? Not today. NATHAN
45) 9) text: What'd he look like? NATHAN
45) 11) text: You sure it was today? Not yesterday? NATHAN
45) 13) text: You're absolutely sure? NATHAN
45) 14) text: Yeah. I know it was today, because I came home for lunch. I was gone all day yesterday. Anyway, you think I could go ahead and get that check from ya? Like I say, it's 55 dollars a plate, so that'd be 110 total. There's no tax... Nathan leans up to scratch his back. Joel seizes the opportunity and pulls away, burning a little rubber.
68) 32) text: Fine. Joel opens the door, about to storm out, only to find NATHAN, standing right there about to ring the doorbell. NATHAN
68) 34) text: Now's not a good time Nathan. Joel turns around, storms off back into the house. NATHAN
68) 37) text: No. Look, we can't talk right now. NATHAN
68) 39) text: Now's not a good time. NATHAN
68) 41) text: I don't know. NATHAN
68) 43) text: Okay tomorrow. NATHAN
68) 45) text: I don't know. Just come by tomorrow. I can't talk now. NATHAN
72) 2) text: Shit... Nathan walks over to Suzie. She's in no mood for this. Sh acts as unfriendly as possible. NATHAN
72) 5) text: Yeah, didn't work out. NATHAN
72) 7) text: Yeah. NATHAN
72) 9) text: Look Nathan, Joel and I aren't going to that dinner okay? Nathan acts deeply disappointed. NATHAN
72) 11) text: Joel never agreed to this Nathan, and neither did I. NATHAN
72) 12) text: Well, it sure sounded like you guys were going. Leslie was gonna talk to you about it, but you didn't return our calls. I mean, I already bought these tickets. They're nonrefundable. I really wish you guys had been a little more clear with me... It's the last straw. Suzie has had enough. She unleashes all her pent-up aggression on Nathan. SUZIE
72) 13) text: Okay, let me be really clear with you then. When we say "I don't think so," or even "I'm not sure," that means "no." Why can't you understand that? NATHAN
72) 16) text: Shut up! In fact, let me be even more clear with you. We don't like you! Is that clear enough? You're dull, you never shut up, you never listen, and we don't want anything to do with you ever again! Nathan freezes, in some kind of state of shock. He starts shake a little. Suzie just keeps going -- it feels too go to stop. SUZIE
72) 17) text: Is that clear enough for you Nathan?! Is that...? Nathan starts to go into some kind of seizure. SUZIE (WORRIED)
72) 18) text: Nathan? Nathan's eyes roll back into his head, and he collapses. Suzie SCREAMS.
81) 0) text: We are CLOSE ON NATHAN, in a coffin, embalmed. We PULL OU to see mourners lined up, taking a last look at the body. Joel is among them. He looks down at Nathan for a moment then continues to his seat. A few rows back, we see SUZIE sitting by herself, dressed in black.
82) 0) text: Quick shot of Nathan's casket being lowered into the grou as the priest says the last few words.
83) 28) text: Well, as I was looking down at Nathan there, I was thinking... That's the longest I've ever seen him with his mouth shut. Suzie LAUGHS in spite of herself. SUZIE
