4) 8) dialog: 
4) 12) dialog: Yeah, actually Nathan, I'm kind of in a hurry here.
4) 14) dialog: Yeah, in fact... (checks his watch) I should go right now actually. I gotta call the office before they leave.

9) 1) dialog: I gotta get a house with a bathroom that's doesn't share a wall with the TV.
9) 3) dialog: It would look suspicious. We never use those other bathrooms... Maybe if I had some insulation put in...
9) 5) dialog: But what do I have really? It's a big pain in the ass.
9) 12) dialog: I'm always working; can't stop or the whole place will fall apart. And what good does it do me anyway? I don't get laid. That stock guy with the shitty band that works for me probably gets laid more than I do.
9) 14) dialog: Hell, I'd move into a crappy apartment if the bathroom wasn't right next to the TV.

16) 10) dialog: Yeah... I'm not sure how it happened, but we have a great safety record and we comply with all the safety codes so... it was just a freak accident. There'll be an investigation of some kind I'm sure.
16) 12) dialog: Oh yeah. Of course. In fact, he'll probably get a huge settlement.
16) 14) dialog: Boy it really makes you stop and think about how fragile we are -- especially our balls. They're just hanging there in a little sack between our legs. At any moment they could be cut off forever.
16) 16) dialog: Yeah... Beat.
16) 17) dialog: You know Dean, my life wouldn't be much different than it is now actually.
16) 24) dialog: Except for once every three months when I have sex with my wife. In fact, I might even be better off...
16) 26) dialog: I did? I must've been lying. I don't know... Maybe things'll get better when I sell the company. I'll be around more...
16) 28) dialog: Ah, it's all right...

20) 11) dialog: No, I guess not. 
20) 14) dialog: Boy, Step sure is being mellow  about all this. 
20) 21) dialog: Boy, it sure does make you think.. 
20) 23) dialog: Who? 
20) 26) dialog: Brian, you call everyone here "Dinkus." I don't know who you're talking about.

21) 12) dialog: Hey, I didn't hire her. She came here through Manpower, like everybody else. They just sent her over.
21) 14) dialog: Yeah, I know. I guess it makes sense though if you think about it. Hot girls need a job just as much as anyone else.
21) 16) dialog: You wanna hear something really weird?
21) 23) dialog: She came on to me.
21) 25) dialog: Yeah. I mean, I'm pretty sure. I could be wrong, but...

21) 35) dialog: But it really seemed like she was flirting with me, you know?
21) 42) dialog: Then, she just sort of asked me out... I think.
21) 44) dialog: Well, you see that guy down there by the fork lift? ANGLE ON Rory, the indi-rock guy with tattoos, etc.
21) 45) dialog: His band is playing somewhere, at some party this weekend, and she asked me if I wanted to go with her.
21) 47) dialog: What? No. No way. I couldn't live with myself if I cheated on Suzie... It'd be nice if I got laid at home once in a while though...
21) 49) dialog: Yeah, I do sort of... We see a COMMOTION down on the floor. Mary runs out of th Women's locker room SCREAMING AND YELLING.
22) 13) dialog: Now wait a second. Calm down Mary. How do you know it was stolen?

27) 3) dialog: 
27) 6) dialog: (takes a drink) Maybe things will be better after I sell the company... Or maybe it's just going to mean more time to sit around and contemplate not getting laid. Dean nods sympathetically.
27) 8) dialog: Yeah... she was really coming on to me. She gave me her phone number and everything. Told me to call her if I wanted to go to that party. Can you believe that? And there's nothing I can do about it, but just be sexually frustrated.
27) 15) dialog: No thanks...
27) 17) dialog: No, I can't. I can't cheat on Suzie. I just gotta power through it until I'm so old that I can't get it up anymore.
27) 19) dialog: Hmm... I hadn't even thought of that...
27) 22) dialog: No. I don't think it would actually. (occuring to him) I guess that's weird huh?
27) 24) dialog: But see, then I could do something about all this sexual frustration, without feeling guilty about it.
27) 26) dialog: Nah...
27) 33) dialog: 
27) 36) dialog: Yeah, maybe.
27) 38) dialog: 
27) 41) dialog: How?

27) 48) dialog: How do you know a gigolo?
27) 55) dialog: Come on Dean.

30) 19) dialog: No no no. God no! It's not like that. I won't even be there. I'll be at work. Remember? We already talked about this. Brad looks blank, like he's not getting it.
30) 20) dialog: What you'll do, is come to my house pretending to be the new pool cleaner. Then you simply try to seduce my wife. Okay? If she doesn't respond, you simply clean the pool and leave. That's all. It's that simple. Hold on Brad for a long beat.
30) 22) dialog: NO! Try to pay attention okay? I will not be there. I will be at work. You come over to my house while I'm not there, posing as the new pool cleaner and then try to seduce her... Brad finally makes a breakthrough.

33) 6) dialog: Shit! What was I thinking?! We gotta call it off. Right now. Can you call that guy, Brad?
33) 8) dialog: Tell him I'll pay him anyway, whatever, just don't come over. God, what was I thinking?!

They are set up on the patio of this small two-bedroom suburban house. Most of t people at the party are crowded around the keg, which is the other side of the backyard, ignoring the band. The ba sounds awful -- loud as hell, unmusical, uninspired. The lead singer sings in that awful Eddie Vedder style, but e more loud and overly dramatic.

61) 4) text: Oh shit... Alright. Joel drags himself out of the chair.    
62) 1) text: .You see, if both his balls had been knocked clean off, he would be a good case, but not a great case: A man with no balls is no man at all. He's a freak. He's barely human. He's gross. And a jury will never feel like they can walk in the shoes of a ball-less, neutered, he/she freak. But Step. He's still got one ball - barely. He's still a man. A man who's very manhood has been jeopardized, but still a man. And that manhood, that very sense of what you are as a human being is hanging by a thread. Jesus, you can't get more dramatic than that. That brave ball, hanging on for dear life, hanging on for justice, is going to be the hero of this trial. I'm tellin' ya this Step guy is the fuckin' Holy Grail, the Powerball Jackpot. And you all laughed at me when I bought those bus bench ads. But I knew the asses of those poor slobs that sit on those benches and ride those sweaty, stinking, cattle cars are our future. And I -- Joel and Brian walk in. ADLER

Joel storms out, leaving the employees standing there. A BICKERING MATCH erupts over who was supposed to do the talking, who said they would say what, who backed down fi etc. "I was gonna say something but you interrupted," "Yo didn't say anything when he was leaving, so I thought you were quitting. I would've stood up to him." As the argument dies down, one by one they all go back to their posts, muttering.

79) 20) text: Well, maybe I don't have to sell the company... You know I've been thinking; all these years I've been building this company, dreaming about the day I could sell it and retire, but what would I really do if I retired?
