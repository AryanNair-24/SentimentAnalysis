30) 25) dialog: Yeah... cool. No problem. This is gonna be great!
30) 32) dialog: Yeah, this is gonna be cool! I can hardly wait! Awesome. Hey man, if you know anyone else who needs -- you know -- what I do, like you know, lonely housewives and shit, maybe you could tell 'em about me, you know... Joel looks on with growing concern as Brad can't seem to talking.
30) 33) dialog: Cuz like, I figure if I did a few jobs and I was, like, really good? Then maybe they'd tell their friends, you know, and they'd give me a... what do you call those things?

30) 37) dialog: Yeah, networking! Totally. Then if I got enough of 'em, maybe I could quit my landscaping job and do this full time. That would be awesome! Cause I hate landscaping. I like getting laid a lot better, and my boss is a total dick...

49) 5) text: No, you're right. He may be a stupid, dull-witted moron, but he can get any girl he wants. Me, I had to work for it. I had to work hard, get a career going, take Suzie out a bunch of times, marry her. But not Brad. He gets to waltz into my house and have sex with my wife just like that. Oh, and by the way? That little prick was at my house again today. DEAN
49) 13) text: Hmm... So should I get my twenty dollars from Brad then or... Joel shoots Dean an angry look. DEAN (CONT'D)

54) 6) text: The same thing that's gonna happen.. Your face is gonna look worse if... GOD DAMMIT! If I ever catch you anywhere near my house or my wife again, I'll have you arrested. BRAD
54) 7) text: For what? Suzie let me in. Joel is stumped -- Brad actually has a point. JOEL
54) 8) text: What the hell is wrong with you anyway? Do you do this with all your clients -- just keep coming back and hanging around? BRAD
54) 10) text: What?! I thought you were a professional! BRAD
54) 13) text: HA! Man are you stupid. You are so goddamn dumb. You think she loves you? You're nothing but a piece of ass to her. That's all. BRAD
54) 15) text: Oh, you don't think so "dude?" Well did you ever think about this: she doesn't even know that I paid you to have sex with her -- did that cross your small mind? BRAD
54) 18) text: How about I go home right now and tell her? Tell her you did it for the money. How about that loverboy? Brad suddenly looks worried. This really freaks him out. BRAD
54) 20) text: You don't think so? Watch me. BRAD
54) 21) text: (realizing he's serious) No... Dude, please don't. Please? Joel starts back to his car. BRAD
54) 23) text: Don't mess it up?! You're talking about my wife! My house! Stupid- ass! Joel gets in his car and starts it. BRAD

60) 3) text: It's not right. I feel horrible. Besides, I think Joel's getting suspicious. And you gotta start cleaning the pool too. BRAD
60) 5) text: Uh-huh... Look Brad, the truth is I love my husband. I really do. This was all a big mistake. I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me, but we have to stop this. I want to make my marriage work again. I'm going to tell Joel about the whole thing and just hope he forgives me. And even if he doesn't, at least I won't be carrying around this horrible feeling. I just can't stand that he doesn't know. BRAD
60) 7) text: Ah, yes it does. BRAD
60) 10) text: Do you need me to say them again? BRAD
60) 12) text: No. BRAD (PLEADING)
60) 14) text: No. Look, you gotta go Brad. Joel could be home any second. BRAD
60) 17) text: Okay. Okay, just go and we'll talk later. Brad leans to kiss her, she pushed him away and he finall leaves. SUZIE (TO HERSELF)
68) 6) text: That's what you're trying to tell me right? You had sex with Brad? SUZIE
68) 16) text: Brad was getting paid?... (disbelief, hurt) So you've been paying Brad this whole time? All fifteen times?! JOEL
68) 29) text: What do you see in Brad anyway? He's borderline retarded. You probably could've been arrested for having sex with a guy that dumb. SUZIE
70) 0) text: Joel sits at the bar, drowning his sorrows. Dean is over the cash register, tending to some business. Brad enters, walks over to Joel. Joel looks the other way. BRAD
70) 2) text: I couldn't kick your ass if I wanted to. You're a good 10 years younger than me, and I'm a pussy. So why don't you just leave me alone. BRAD
70) 3) text: I just wanted to tell you, I'm not gonna see Suzie anymore. You don't have to worry. Joel keeps drinking his beer, stares straight ahead. BRAD
70) 5) text: Why'd you have to get hung up on Suzie? You could have any girl you want. BRAD
70) 10) text: Well... You told me. BRAD
70) 11) text: Alright, later... Brad starts to leave. Then he stops, turns around. BRAD
70) 13) text: Brad, you had sex with my wife. I'm not gonna give you a job, okay? BRAD
70) 14) text: Okay... Sorry man. Brad walks away. Joel stares at his beer for a beat, thinking. He calls out to Brad. JOEL
70) 15) text: Hey Brad?... Brad stops. BRAD
70) 17) text: I don't know... Maybe come by the office tomorrow. Fill out an application. I'll see what I can do. BRAD
