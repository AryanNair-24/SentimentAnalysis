89) 5) text: The window slams shut. Everett waits for a moment, wondering, eyeing the nasty-looking kids. The door opens. Mrs. Russel is a powerful-looking woman in her fifties. She wears a shapeless floral housedress that ends at the shoulders and the knees, and she twists a gold locket that she wears around her neck. Suddenly she yells.

113) 1) dialog: You drunk, now aren't I right?
113) 3) dialog: You a terrible driver, you know that? A city bus looms ahead. Everett's car careens wildly to avoid it.
113) 5) dialog: Let me drive. What kind of white man drives a shitbox like this anyway? Suddenly the car is filled with red and white light -- and the sound of SIRENS.
113) 7) dialog: Gun it, mister! Everett flashes her a scary grin.
115) 2) dialog: Well, don't slow down now! The cruiser moves in front of Everett's car and we see its brake lights flare.

121) 0) text: A GRANDFATHER CLOCK TICKS QUIETLY. On the STEREO, DEBUSSY'S "Clair de Lune." A Persian rug, rare books, a dainty escritoire by the window. MRS. LOWENSTEIN is bent over her needlework. Mr. Lowenstein, the paper's owner and the governor's pal, sits in a leather wing chair, writing a letter. SIRENS. DISTANT at first, but insistent.
121) 2) dialog: A fire, maybe. Or another accident up on the curve. Another sound. A RUMBLING, CLATTERING sound. Mr. Lowenstein glances at the grandfather clock: 11:48. He stands, pulling his bathrobe closed over his silk pajamas. He moves to the window and peers out toward the street below.
121) 6) dialog: What is it, dear?
121) 8) dialog: Oh? One of your reporters?
