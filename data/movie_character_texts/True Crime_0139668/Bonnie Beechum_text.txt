In her hand is a small brown object, which she waggles back and forth. From under the sound of the mower, the COOING of a BABY. We LOOK DOWN AND TO THE RIGHT: There's a plastic sandbox shaped like a turtle, and in it is Frank's little daughter, GAIL, whacking the sand with her shovel and cooing at her father.

Beachum hears the sounds of PLASTIC BENCHES SCRAPING behind the blinds as they enter the room. Is Bonnie there? He peers into the dark.
