2) 16) text: Without warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temp with blinding speed.  The blow flings him with a CLANG in the jungle gym.  He drops to the ground in a still heap, eyes open, twitching. The leader whips out his SWITCHBLADE and slashes in one motion.  Terminator ducks back and catches the knife- wielder's wrist in an inhuman grip.  Then he punches the leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone. ANGLE - PAVEMENT, as the knife clatters down.  The punk's combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground. ANGLE - TWO SHOT, Terminator and the leader are close together as if dancing, but motionless.  Their bodies are total shadow.  The punk's eyes are wide, his veins disten with an agonizing pressure.  Terminator jerks his fist ba with a WET SOUND and the other drops OUT OF FRAME. The last tough is stumbling away, gaping with terror.  He backs into a chainlink fence, turns to run along it, find he is in a corner. Terminator takes a step toward him, his gaze ominous. The punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes. Thunder peals overhead.
