248) 3) text: He sags, sliding down the wall.  She pulls him up. Half-carries him into the maze of machines. The dark gallery is filled with WHIRRING, CLANKING SHAPES SHATTERING CONVEYER BELTS and improbable mechanisms lashi mindlessly. Reese slips to the floor and Sarah is no longer able to support him.
248) 5) text: Sarah crouches beside him. Grabs his shirt front. Yells over the machines.
248) 6) dialog: I'm not leaving you anywhere you jerk.  Haven't you figured it out?  Kyle, John is our son.
248) 8) dialog: (continuing) There isn't going to be anybody else...I don't want anybody else.  Listen to me!
248) 10) dialog: (continuing) Move!  Reese! Let's go. Move you ass!
248) 11) text: She drags him to his feet and he staggers on. Hinges SHATTER and the firedoor is hurled inward. The Terminator scans the darkness. ANGLE - PANNING WITH SARAH AND KYLE as they move through the machines. The cyborg steps forward, scanning methodically. Sarah and Kyle move in a crouch through the treacherous tangle of pipes and machinery.  Kyle picks up a length of pipe to use as a weapon.  As they climb out onto a cat- walk between the two huge mechanisms, Sarah clambers over an innocuous CONTROL PANEL. Her knee inadvertently hits a RED PUSH BUTTON. With a ROAR the stamping-plate of a HYDRAULIC PRESS slams down an inch from her hand. Startled, she tumbles to the catwalk. The Terminator's eyes swivel as he hears the single non- rhythmic sound. Kyle and Sarah run to the end of the catwalk, but find th door there locked.
248) 12) dialog: Come on!
248) 15) text: He pushes Sarah roughly and she stumbles away. Kyle raises the pipe with his good arm as the Terminator advances.
248) 17) text: She hesitates, backing away. The cyborg swings at Reese STEEL CLANGS ON STEEL. Kyle strikes and parries but is sledgehammered back. ANGLE ON CATWALK as Kyle lands in a heap, smashed against a stanchion of the railing which prevented him falling to the factory floor twenty feet below. Sarah turns and runs. LOW ANGLE PAST REESE, F.G., as the cyborg approaches him. E.C.U. - A FUSE BURNING. C.U. - KYLE'S FACE streaked with blood, pressed to the floor as a metal foot CLANGS DOWN, F.G.   His eyes snap o Sarah falls, gets up, runs on. The Terminator draws back for a death blow. And Kyle rolls with the last of his strength, raising the pipe bomb he has been cradling.  He jams it between t hydraulic cylinders just beneath the cyborg's armored  ri cage.  Then rolls off the catwalk.  Terminator has an ins to react, reaching for the bomb, before it EXPLODES. Sarah is pitched forward by the blast and slides on the floor. Slams up against one wall. A withering spray of shrapnel strafes the walls around he Pieces of scrap metal clatter throughout the factory, rai ing down. C.U. - SARAH, very still.  She winces and opens her eyes. Slowly looks up. POV - SARAH, as the smoke clears.  The Terminator is GONE Unrecognizable clumps of BURNING DEBRIS lie scattered abo Looking down through the grating floor she sees Kyle's body. LOW ANGLE ON KYLE F.G., Sarah on catwalk above.  Kyle's e are half-open.  Still.  His face peaceful. ANGLE ON ONE OF THE FIRES climbing some plastic tubing an triggering a SPRINKLER HEAD.  It begins to rain. C.U. - SARAH sitting up as the water runs over her. She looks down.  Protruding from her right thigh is a TWI PIECE OF METAL.  Shrapnel.  Part of the cyborg.  She pull it out, grimacing.  Her leg is broken. It is a long time before she can gather the will to move. SARAH'S POV - She sees a WALL PHONE several yards away, beyond the debris from the explosion. She starts to crawl toward it. She passes A LARGE CLUMP OF DEBRIS, F.G. ANGLE ON DEBRIS (FX) as it rolls over suddenly! Now recognizable as the TERMINATOR'S HEAD AND ARMS, with half of the scattered torso trailing wires and twisted metal.
248) 19) dialog: (voice icy) You're...terminated...fucker!
249) 0) text: CLOSE ON the side rail of an ambulance gurney SNAPPING UP into position.  Sarah's eyes are closed and she is moved OUT OF FRAME. WIDE SHOT, showing the gurney being rolled by TWO ATTENDA past the site of the last explosion. SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS are picking through the debris. PANNING WITH THE GURNEY as it is wheeled out, holding on TWO FACTORY EMPLOYEES, F.G. One, the PLANT MANAGER, bends to examine a piece of the cyborg lying at the base of the hydraulic press. A COP, B.G., notices this.
250) 0) text: Sarah is being lifted into the ambulance.  She looks up as the doors are latched shut. TILT UP to follow her gaze. The sign above the entrance of the building reads:
251) 1) dialog: ...and the hardest thing is deciding what I should tell you and what not to.  Well, anyway, I've got a while yet before you're old enough to understand the tapes.  They're more for me at this point... to help get it all straight.
251) 2) text: COVER SHOT reveals Sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrove parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station.  All of its signs are in hand-lettered Spanish.  Beyond lies an expanse of scrub desert.  The sky scowls with an impendin storm. Sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark- complected attendant laconically fills her tank.  She cradles the cassette recorder in her lap, in the lee of her SWOLLEN BELLY. She looks to be about SIX MONTHS ALONG. Under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster and the butt of a .357 REVOLVER presses against her breast.  She tugs the vest closed as the attendant glance her way.  A German Shepherd sits in the back among taped boxes and suitcases.
251) 3) dialog: (continuing) Should I tell you about your father?  That's a tough one. Will it change your decision to send him here...knowing? But if you don't send Kyle, you could never be.  God, you can go crazy thinking about all this...I suppose I'll tell you...I owe him that. And maybe it'll be enough if you know that in the few hours we had together we loved a lifetime's worth...
251) 4) text: CLICK.  WHIR.  Sarah jumps at a sound nearby, breaking her reverie.  A small MEXICAN BOY has snapped her picture with a beat-up Polaroid camera.  He holds it out to her, speaking rapid Spanish.
251) 6) dialog: That's a pretty good hustle, kid.  Four.  Quatro.
251) 10) dialog: What did he say?
251) 12) text: Sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the desert.  Heat lightning pulses in their depths.
251) 13) dialog: (quietly) I know.
