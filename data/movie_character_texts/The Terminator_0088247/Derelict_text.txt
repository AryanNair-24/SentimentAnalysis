Seedy apartments and storefron The streets glisten, hissing with sporadic late night tra SLOW PAN AND DOLLY into the mouth of a narrow alley lined with trash containers and fire escapes.  From a recessed doorway, two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement An angry, inarticulate DRUNKARD'S MONOLOGUE rises occasio above the rain sounds. ANGLE - DOORWAY,  The derelict rouses from his bitter stu as a brilliant purple glare lights up the wet brickwork around him.  A shockwave hurls trash into the air. Painted over windows shatter. Rat scurry, blinded. A FIGURE drops INTO FRAME as if out of the sky and smacks the pavement with a muddy splash. C.U. - DERELICT, as he blinks at the fading glare, amazed A NAKED MAN, compact and muscular, rises in a defensive crouch.  KYLE REESE is 22, but his face has been aged by ordeal, the mouth hard, eyes grim.  A crinkled burn scar traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead.  Ot scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body. The rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin as electrical ARCS lace back and forth between the fire escapes behind him, HISSING and SPUTTERING.  The sound fades, then stops altogether, to be replaced by a rising scream of animal agony. Reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley.
