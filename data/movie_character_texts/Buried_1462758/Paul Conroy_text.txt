1) 0) text: Darkness. Silence. After a long beat, we hear movement, confined and contained. We then hear the sound of a man, PAUL CONROY, groaning, making confused attempts at words. We hear his movement; short, abrupt shifting, ending almost immediately with th sound of his body banging against wood. He screams, though it's clear from the sound that his mou is covered by something. After attempting to sit up, he immediately bangs his head against something. It's terribly warm and his breaths are labored. He attempts to move to his left and right, only to find t he is confined on those sides, as well. He frantically shifts about, only to discover, by touch, that he is enca in something. Something is very wrong, and he doesn't need to see to kn that. Finally, we see him, lit by the flame of the Zippo he hol in his hands, which are bound together in front of him wi rope. A rolled-up, dirty rag is tied tightly around his head, stretched across his mouth. Dried blood stains his hair and forehead.
1) 2) dialog: What...? What is this? His words become almost unintelligible as he flails about though fear is understood in his every utterance. He screams aloud, but his voice is captured by the coffin walls. 2.
1) 5) dialog: Oh my God! Help me!! Help me!! He kicks and slams his hands against the top and sides of coffin, all to no avail. His violent movements cause smal grains of sand to trickle in through the space between th sides and top of the coffin, as well as a small gap that exists between one of the coffin's broken wooden planks. Sweat cascades down the side of his neck, dripping from h dampened brow. The heat inside the extremely close confin of the coffin is stifling.
1) 6) dialog: Somebody help me! Please!! Paul continues with his futile efforts to pry off the top the coffin. The sides, the top, the bottom -- all are too thoroughly reinforced by the force of what surrounds the coffin. Sand. It becomes clear to him that he is buried. He tries his best to calm himself, though he has trouble catching his breath. It takes him some time, but he eventually achieves some semblance of calm. Getting a good look at him for the first time, we see tha Paul is somewhere around 37 years old. Unshaven and physically unremarkable, he embodies the blue-collar Amer everyman. He coughs. The minimal amount of oxygen in the coffin mak it hard for him to breathe. His eyes widen a bit upon seeing an exposed, rusty nail. tries desperately to use the nail to cut through the old, frayed ropes that bind his hands. Doing so is no easy tas The incredibly tight quarters makes his every action near impossible. After a lengthy struggle, the rope snaps. Paul quickly fr his hands. A small victory. Very small. The heat is unbearable. Paul takes off his button-down shirt, leaving him in a T-shirt. His body battles against the walls and the ceiling of the coffin with every move h makes. He tosses his button-down shirt down by his feet. His undershirt is drenched through with sweat. Still trying to calm himself, but having little success i doing so, Paul looks around the coffin. His feet, though only his body-length away, seem miles from him. 3.
1) 10) dialog: What is this? With his sobbing slowly subsiding, the coffin soon grows eerily silent. The sound of Paul's labored breaths are all we hear, soft under the blanket of absolute darkness. After a beat, the silence is interrupted by a subtle buzz sound. The muted sight of strange, blueish light flickers the coffin, by Paul's feet. He is extremely startled. The buzzing continues, as does the minimal splashing of light. It's coming from underneath his discarded button-d shirt, down near his feet. He lights the Zippo to get a better look.
1) 14) dialog: Come on, come on. What was it?
1) 16) dialog: No. Where the hell is it? Son of a...Come on!
1) 18) dialog: Help me! Please! Somebody help me! His words barely make it pass the coffin walls. With the cell phone still in hand, and laboring to reclai the breath he just expended, Paul turns to desperation. H dials the international code of 001, and then dials 911. A FEMALE 911 OPERATOR answers almost immediately. 5.
1) 22) dialog: No! Wait! Paul accidentally bangs the cap of the Zippo against the coffin wall, putting out the flame. She quickly returns.
1) 24) dialog: Hello?
1) 26) dialog: I'm buried. You have to help me. You have to help me, I can't breathe...
1) 29) dialog: I'm buried in a coffin. Please help me! Send someone to find me...
1) 31) dialog: Paul. Paul Conroy.
1) 33) dialog: I don't know. I'm in a coffin. I don't know where. I'm scared. Please help me. 6.
1) 37) dialog: Yeah, it's, like, one of those old, wooden ones.
1) 39) dialog: No. I don't know. No.
1) 41) dialog: What?
1) 43) dialog: A cell phone. There was an old cell phone in the coffin.
1) 45) dialog: Yes. No. It's not mine, but yes, I'm calling from a cell phone.
1) 47) dialog: I didn't climb in.
1) 49) dialog: I was put here.
1) 51) dialog: Yes. Please send help. 7.
1) 55) dialog: I think so. It's...it's hot in here. I can't breathe.
1) 57) dialog: I told you, I don't know. Somewhere in Iraq.
1) 60) dialog: Yes. I'm a truck driver, an American. I work for CRT.
1) 62) dialog: No. Please, please listen to me. I'm a truck driver. I work for CRT. I'm a civilian contractor working in Iraq. We were attacked in Baqubah, they...they...
1) 66) dialog: All of the other drivers.
1) 68) dialog: Yes. Please, you have to help me. They gave me a safety number to call, but I had it stored in my wallet and --
1) 72) dialog: Ohio?
1) 74) dialog: Sheriff's Department? No...you don't underst...
1) 76) dialog: Come on, come on. Pick up. Please. After sitting through the agony of a few more rings, Paul met with the answering machine.
1) 79) dialog: Linda, honey, it's me. Listen, I need you to contact the National Guard right away. Or the Pentagon. Tell them we were attacked in the Diyala Provence, in Baqubah.
1) 82) dialog: They have to find me. Please help me, baby. Please help them find me. Paul hangs up. He dials his wife's cell phone right away. After several rings, her cell phone voice mail picks up. hear the sound of Linda, Paul's wife, on her outgoing message.
1) 85) dialog: Linda, it's Paul. I need you to call me right away. This is an absolute emergency. Call the number that comes up on your phone. Call me at that number. If I don't answer, call the Pentagon or the F.B.I. I don't know what the hell is going on, but I'm buried in a box... Hearing himself say those last words gives him pause. The gravity of the situation fully takes hold.
1) 86) dialog: ...I can't breathe in here. Make sure you call me right away. Please, baby, please call me.
1) 91) dialog: Um...I don't know. The F.B.I., wherever they are. Paul reaches for his button-down shirt. Fishes for pens stashed in his lapel pocket, while keeping the phone pres to his ear with his shoulder.
1) 94) dialog: I don't care, any city. Just connect me to the F.B.I.
1) 96) dialog: Anywhere! Any city, just connect me, please!
1) 98) dialog: Fine, um...Chicago. Okay?
1) 105) dialog: Hello? Is this the F.B.I.?
1) 107) dialog: I'm calling from Iraq. I'm buried in the desert somewhere. I need you to help me --
1) 109) dialog: Now. I'm there now. I'm a truck driver for CRT. I've been here for nine months.
1) 111) dialog: Paul Conroy.
1) 116) dialog: Alright. Me and a convoy of other drivers were delivering kitchen parts to a community center. As we got closer, a bunch of kids started throwing rocks at our trucks. Then an IED went off up ahead and blew up one of the other trucks. These guys came out from behind the houses with guns and started shooting everybody right there on the street.
1) 118) dialog: I don't know! (after a breath, calmer) I don't know. I was way in the back of the convoy. I must have got hit in the head with one of the rocks and got knocked out. That's the last thing I remember. But now I just woke up, and I was tied up and buried in a coffin.
1) 120) dialog: I guess whoever ambushed us.
1) 123) dialog: No, you're not listening. The kids threw the rocks at us, but then some Iraqi guys -- maybe insurgents, I don't fucking know -- popped out of nowhere and started shooting at us.
1) 127) dialog: They didn't, I don't know! But they shot them!
1) 129) dialog: I'm shouting because you're not listening! I need you to help me! Please!!
1) 132) dialog: Can you trace my call? GPS or something?
1) 134) dialog: I have no idea. They didn't, that's all I know.
1) 136) dialog: Why? Who cares? I'm buried in the middle of the fucking desert! Who cares what my social security number is?! I'm an American citizen. Just send someone to find me!
1) 138) dialog: Hello? What? I can't hear you.
1) 142) dialog: Hello?! Hello?! Paul checks the phone's display, where he sees that the c has been lost.
1) 143) dialog: Shit!! Cell phone service temporarily goes down. Paul lights the Zippo to help him see the cell phone screen. He tries to make a call, but nothing happens. He shakes the phone, moves it around the coffin, all in desperate hope that he will get a signal. He soon does.
1) 146) dialog: Somebody, I need to talk to someone right away. It's an emergency.
1) 148) dialog: Paul Conroy. I'm a driver for you guys. I'm calling from Iraq. My convoy was attacked.
1) 152) dialog: I know, I know, but I don't have it. They took it.
1) 154) dialog: The Iraqis, I think. I don't remember, I blacked out.
1) 156) dialog: Davenport? Who's that?
1) 159) dialog: Personnel? No, I need to talk -- Paul is placed on hold. Synthesized soft rock plays in th background of the phone, maddening Paul further. Over the music, a CRT SPOKESMAN is heard, speaking a recorded testimonial during the on-hold message.
1) 165) dialog: This is Paul Conroy, I'm from Hastings, Michigan. I'm a driver for CRT, and my convoy was ambushed...by insurgents or terrorists. I don't know. I don't know who it was. I'm stuck in the ground, buried in a coffin and I need help. Please send help. I'm begging you. I think I'm in Baqubah in the Diyala Provence. Please send help right away. I can't breathe in here. I can't...please. I'm begging you. I don't know who else to call. I...
1) 167) dialog: 
1) 172) dialog: Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? After a beat, Paul hears breathing on the other end of th phone. He also hears a discordance of background sound; t din of a room filled with Arabic-speaking men.
1) 173) dialog: Hello? Who are you? Please, you have to help me. Still, Paul's words are only met with slow, measured brea
1) 174) dialog: Who is this? Hello? The person on the other end eventually speaks. An Iraqi m JABIR, talks forcefully and aggressively in broken Englis
1) 176) dialog: What? I don't know what you're saying. Who is this?
1) 179) dialog: No, I can't breathe. Please get me out of here.
1) 181) dialog: Yes, please get me out. Help me.
1) 185) dialog: No, no I'm not a soldier. I'm a truck driver. That's it. I'm not a soldier. I'm a contractor.
1) 187) dialog: Yes, that's right. A contractor. Not a soldier.
1) 189) dialog: No, not for Blackwater. I'm not a security contractor. Truck driver, I'm a truck driver. That's all.
1) 191) dialog: Yes.
1) 193) dialog: No, I'm not. I'm here unarmed. But, you still shot at us.
1) 195) dialog: I'm not lying! We were all drivers.
1) 197) dialog: Trucks. The big trucks you see driving around with the supplies? That's us. That's me. We're not soldiers. 19.
1) 201) dialog: What?
1) 203) dialog: Five million dollars? From who?
1) 205) dialog: My family doesn't have five million dollars. If they did, I wouldn't be here.
1) 207) dialog: I don't know, yes, the Embassy will pay you. If you let me go, they'll pay you the money. Silence on the other end of the phone.
2) 0) text: The Zippo lights. Paul holds it in his hand, using it to illuminate the inside of the coffin. He attempts to push into its now customary resting place, but the sand has loosened, making it difficult for the Zippo to stay in pl It almost falls to the floor. 20.
2) 4) dialog: 
2) 8) dialog: Hastings, Michigan. I'm looking for Donna Mitchell. 21.
2) 12) dialog: Ardmore Avenue...I think. Yeah. Shit, I don't know. Just give me that one.
2) 14) dialog: Yes, Ardmore Avenue.
2) 17) dialog: Come on! Where the hell is everyone?
2) 20) dialog: Donna, it's Paul.
2) 24) dialog: Where's Linda? She's not answering her phone. I need to talk to her, I've been taken hostage by... Donna interrupts. We realize, as does Paul, that her voic was actually coming from her answering machine.
2) 28) dialog: Donna, I need to talk to Linda. It's an absolute emergency. Have her call me. Use star sixty-nine and find out the number I'm calling from and have her call me... Donna picks up the phone.
2) 30) dialog: Donna.
2) 32) dialog: I need to talk to Linda. Where is she?
2) 34) dialog: Are you near a computer or something?
2) 36) dialog: Turn it on. 23.
2) 40) dialog: Look up the number for the State Department for me.
2) 43) dialog: Donna, please, please, please -- just get me the number.
2) 45) dialog: No! Everything is not alright! So, please, just look up the number.
2) 47) dialog: I'm not yelling!
2) 49) dialog: 
2) 55) dialog: Donna, I'm very sorry I yelled. But, I'm only going to ask you once more to get me this number. If you don't get me this number, I'm going to die.
2) 57) dialog: I don't have time to explain. Please...the number.
2) 61) dialog: 
2) 68) dialog: I'm an American citizen, working in Iraq. I've been taken hostage. I need to speak to someone right away.
2) 71) dialog: From Iraq. I'm a truck driver for CRT -- Crestin, Roland and Thomas. We were attacked and now I'm being held for ransom.
2) 73) dialog: No. I'm buried somewhere.
2) 75) dialog: Yeah, in a coffin, a wooden box. It's an old coffin, I think.
2) 77) dialog: I don't have the number.
2) 79) dialog: I was given a number to call, a safety number. But the people took it. 26.
2) 83) dialog: Yes.
2) 86) dialog: No. Wait... Paul is placed on hold. As he waits, his eyes wander arou the coffin. He looks at the numbers he has written.
2) 89) dialog: Hello?
2) 91) dialog: Yeah, my situation. I'm running out of time and you people keep putting me on hold. What the hell is wrong with you?
2) 94) dialog: Don't be sorry. Just help me.
2) 96) dialog: You've got to be kidding me.
2) 102) dialog: Wait, wait, wait...how did you know my name?
2) 104) dialog: I never gave you my name. I don't think I gave it to the other guy, either. Rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone.
2) 105) dialog: What the hell is going on right now?
2) 108) dialog: Yeah...?
2) 110) dialog: Well, since you know what the hell is going on, what have you done to get me out of here?
2) 112) dialog: So, that's it? I'm just supposed to rot in here because there's little you can do?
2) 114) dialog: Then what?
2) 118) dialog: In the Diyala Provence. In Baqubah.
2) 120) dialog: Yes. The guy told me that he wants five million dollars by nine o'clock tonight.
2) 122) dialog: Or else he'll bring me to Sea World. What do you think, lady? Even faced with Paul's sarcasm, Rebecca remains stolid. Professional.
2) 124) dialog: So you'll pay them?
2) 127) dialog: Wait...what?
2) 130) dialog: To hell with that! It's easy for you to worry about policy, you're sitting in an air conditioned office somewhere, probably finishing up your sandwich from lunch. You're not the one stuck in a coffin, buried in the God damn desert!
2) 134) dialog: Frustration? Lady, I'm going to fucking die in here. Understand that! Rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone. Paul wonders if she is still there. The idea of being alone ag scares him terribly.
2) 135) dialog: Hello? Worried, Paul lights the Zippo. The reflection of the fla dances on his frightened eyes.
2) 138) dialog: Well, then say something. Tell me how you're going to get me out of here.
2) 140) dialog: I don't know. Did it come up on your end?
2) 143) dialog: Go ahead.
2) 146) dialog: Who's that?
2) 150) dialog: Hostage Working Group?
2) 152) dialog: Situations. I love how you keep calling it that.
2) 155) dialog: Yeah.
2) 157) dialog: What about the news? I'm going to call them.
2) 159) dialog: Why?
2) 162) dialog: That's bullshit. You're just covering your ass.
2) 166) dialog: You don't go looking for something if you don't know it's missing.
2) 168) dialog: Fine.
2) 172) dialog: Dan Brenner?
2) 175) dialog: 
2) 180) dialog: Oh, thank you, God.
2) 182) dialog: That's what he said.
2) 184) dialog: Yeah, in an old, wooden coffin.
2) 186) dialog: I don't know. Maybe.
2) 189) dialog: Less than half.
2) 191) dialog: Vibrate.
2) 195) dialog: What about my Zippo?
2) 197) dialog: Yeah.
2) 199) dialog: Won't it use up oxygen?
2) 201) dialog: It's really dark in here without it.
2) 203) dialog: You guys have to hurry.
2) 206) dialog: Do you know if there were any other survivors?
2) 208) dialog: Yeah.
2) 210) dialog: I just wanted to do right by my family. That's all.
2) 213) dialog: I didn't know it was going to be like this over here.
2) 215) dialog: It's him. He's calling.
2) 218) dialog: Yeah. What do I do?
2) 220) dialog: Yeah.
2) 222) dialog: What about the call?
2) 224) dialog: He's going to hang up.
2) 226) dialog: 
2) 231) dialog: Hello.
2) 233) dialog: You have to give me more time.
2) 235) dialog: Yes. No. I talked to...someone. Government. They said that they won't pay the money.
2) 237) dialog: No. They said that they don't negotiate with terrorists.
2) 239) dialog: Yes. You are terrorist, you son of a bitch.
2) 241) dialog: What did I ever do to you?
2) 243) dialog: Yeah. I'm here because it's a job, to make money. That's it.
2) 247) dialog: That's not my fault! Jabir retorts with a spirited conviction similar to Paul'
2) 249) dialog: I told you, I'm only here to work. To help rebuild.
2) 252) dialog: Stop! Just please, stop! I'm just a guy. I'm just a truck driver. Okay? I'm nobody that makes decisions about anything. I just want to go home. Silence from the other end of the phone for an extended period of time.
2) 255) dialog: Yes. Please. Get me out of here and I'll make the video.
2) 257) dialog: What...? How?
2) 262) dialog: Where? I don't see --
2) 265) dialog: The video...if I make it, will you let me go?
2) 267) dialog: Nobody's going to pay five million dollars for me.
2) 269) dialog: If they pay it, will you let me go?
2) 277) dialog: Shit. Paul presses and holds down the shortcut button on the ph that changes the ringer from vibrate to an audible tone. The glow stick begins to slowly fade. Paul dials Dan Brenner. After a few rings, Dan answers.
2) 279) dialog: Here's his number...
2) 282) dialog: It's 07902-24-921. Dan says something to someone who is in the room with him and then returns his attention to Paul.
2) 285) dialog: What about me? Can you track my cell signal?
2) 287) dialog: What does that mean?
2) 289) dialog: He wants me to make a ransom video. 40.
2) 293) dialog: If it's going to get me out of here, I'm making it.
2) 295) dialog: We? Paul becomes angry, again sensing that more emphasis is b placed on containing the situation than rescuing him.
2) 298) dialog: That's all you people care about! But what about me? Don't you care about me?
2) 300) dialog: No you don't! You people don't care about any of us. I've had eight friends killed out here, six of them today. We don't have any guns, any armor. Nothing.
2) 303) dialog: Tell that to the people who put me in this box! Tell that to the people who shot my friends!
2) 305) dialog: No, you're not. All you people understand are your secret plans and your back room politics.
2) 308) dialog: If I were some diplomat or something, maybe even a hostage working group leader -- or whatever your fancy title is, I'd be out of here by now. Wouldn't I? But I'm not, so I'm just supposed to keep my mouth shut and die.
2) 310) dialog: Fuck you. Dan's heard enough.
2) 312) dialog: Who are they? The people who put me here?
2) 314) dialog: I'm no terrorist.
2) 316) dialog: How do you know that?
2) 318) dialog: I wouldn't kill someone. 42.
2) 322) dialog: 
2) 325) dialog: So pay them, then.
2) 327) dialog: How many others have there been?
2) 329) dialog: How many have you rescued? Dan is reluctant to answer the question.
2) 330) dialog: How many?
2) 333) dialog: Tell me their names.
2) 335) dialog: Any of them. Make me know they really do matter to you.
2) 339) dialog: Who was Mark White?
2) 341) dialog: What happened to him?
2) 343) dialog: When?
2) 346) dialog: You remember his name.
2) 348) dialog: (afraid to ask) Did he...? Is he...? The glow stick begins to fade.
2) 351) dialog: Where is he?
2) 353) dialog: I want to get out of here. 44.
2) 357) dialog: How?
2) 359) dialog: You do?
2) 362) dialog: That's...that's good.
2) 364) dialog: What should I do in the meantime?
2) 366) dialog: I can't help it. I'm always anxious. I take pills for it.
2) 369) dialog: Yeah.
2) 371) dialog: Okay. 45.
2) 375) dialog: Not now.
2) 377) dialog: I feel nauseous.
2) 379) dialog: I'm trying.
2) 382) dialog: Okay.
2) 384) dialog: Yeah. I'm trying. Dan ends the call. Paul lets out a deep breath, finding i difficult to lay claim to its replacement. He looks at his watch. It's now 7:18pm. The ticking sound of the second hand turning is inordinately loud, due to t extreme silence of the coffin. Just then, the cell phone rings. Checking the number on t display, Paul sees that it is Jabir. Paul answers.
2) 385) dialog: What?
2) 389) dialog: No. Jabir yells something in Arabic to the other Iraqi men we hear in the background. Collectively, they do not sound pleased. Slightly panicke in fact, though it is difficult to tell for sure.
2) 392) dialog: Let me out and I'll make it.
2) 394) dialog: I can't. I can't read the paper.
2) 396) dialog: I can't. I don't know what you want me to say. I can't read the paper. Jabir is heard speaking with the men we hear arguing in t background. Although they speak in Arabic, it is clear fr their tone that they are becoming worried and increasingl hostile. Jabir returns his attention back to Paul.
2) 401) dialog: I'm never getting out of here. Paul begins to freak out, restlessly squirming inside the coffin and pressing against the sides and top. The glow stick fades out almost completely, offering very little light. Paul shakes it, but with no change to its brightness. Moments later, it dies. Paul tries the flashlight. Click-click. Click-click. Nothing. He bangs it a few times with his hand. The white light tu on, but quickly turns back off. He twists the top, which causes the flashlight to switch bulbs. A red beam emits momentarily. Paul twists the top again and gives the flashlight a few good whacks.
2) 404) dialog: I was hoping I could speak with Maryanne Conroy, please.
2) 410) dialog: Mom...it's Paul.
2) 413) dialog: It's Paul, Mom. Your son.
2) 415) dialog: It's okay, Mom. How are you?
2) 417) dialog: That's good.
2) 420) dialog: It's your son, Mom. It's Paulie.
2) 422) dialog: Yeah. Remember? We lived over on Colfax Street, in the duplex. Remember?
2) 425) dialog: That's right, Mom. 49.
2) 429) dialog: It is, Mom. It's Paulie. How's everything at the home?
2) 431) dialog: Yeah...I don't think Pop's there with you, Mom.
2) 434) dialog: Not very good. This...uh, this may be the last time I talk to you.
2) 436) dialog: Did you get the flowers I sent a few months ago?
2) 438) dialog: Yeah, I sent...never mind. Listen, I...I'm going to go now. I just wanted to talk to you, you know, just to say bye. I love you, Mom. Maryanne doesn't respond.
2) 439) dialog: Did you hear me? Mom? I told you...do you want to tell me you
2) 444) dialog: (after a beat) Okay, Mom. Tell Pop I said hi. Paul ends the call and instantly begins crying his heart He lays there, sobbing relentlessly. After a long beat, the cell phone rings. Decidedly differ than his past reactions to an incoming call, Paul seems hopelessly disinterested. The ring is maddening. He mindlessly presses the shortcut button, resetting the to vibrate mode. He eventually picks up the phone, but there is not anyone the other end. It's then that he sees that it was not a c that came in, but instead was a picture message. Pressing what appears to be the Accept button, the incomi picture begins to download. Several seconds later, the picture downloads and an image appears on the display of Paul's cell phone. It's of a wo -- bound and gagged, a gun pressed against the side of he head.
2) 445) dialog: Oh no. No, no, no! Paul frantically dials the number to reach Jabir. As soon the phone connects, Paul begins his desperate plea.
2) 448) dialog: Let her go. Please. Please don't hurt her. The Woman is heard in the background of Jabir's phone, cr muffled words through her muzzled mouth.
2) 450) dialog: No! No, please no shoot. No shoot her.
2) 454) dialog: I will, I promise. Just don't shoot her. She's a mother, she's got two kids.
2) 456) dialog: Yes. She has two kids.
2) 458) dialog: Wait...
2) 461) dialog: I can't read the paper.
2) 463) dialog: No. Wait!
2) 465) dialog: I don't know what you want me to say!
2) 468) dialog: Okay! Okay, I'll make the video. Just, please, don't shoot. Jabir does not fire his gun. Paul attempts to catch his breath.
2) 469) dialog: I need to hang up to make the video. Okay? Is that okay?
2) 473) dialog: (re: the script) Fuck... He drops the paper to his side and opens the phone, setti it to the video record function. He places the flashlight close to his face so as to make his image more visible on small, phone display screen.
2) 475) dialog: (speaking at the phone) My name is Paul Conroy. I'm an American citizen from Hastings, Michigan. I'm a civilian truck driver for Crestin, Roland and Thomas. I've been taken hostage somewhere in Iraq...and I need one million dollars by nine o'clock tonight, Baghdad time, or else I'll be left to die in this coffin I'm buried in. I've been told that if... The flashlight goes out. Paul continues speaking in the darkness. After a few quick smacks, the flashlight turns back on.
2) 476) dialog: ...the money is paid, I will be let go. If it's not, I will die in here. These threats are real and will be followed through on. Trying to think of more to say, Paul soon opts for not sa anything further. He saves the message and then sends it Jabir. We see that the screen displays an icon confirming the vi has been sent. Paul places the phone on his chest. Still rubbing his temples, his eyes begin to flutter a bit. He tries to control his breathing and remain calm. 53.
3) 0) text: Darkness once again. We hear the sound of Paul slowly awaking, followed the sight of Zippo sparks. It doesn't catch. The second glow stick is snapped, illuminating the coffin with a fluorescent green hue.
3) 8) dialog: No, no, no!! Desperately straining every muscle in his body, he extend his arm backward toward the Zippo, hoping to move it away from the spilled alcohol. He still can't reach it, yet he tries with all his might. The phone stops ringing. He has missed the call. He tries blowing at the flame, but his head is too far aw and his breath is not strong enough to do much more than cause it to flicker. With the alcohol now mere inches away from the flame, Pau reaches for his shoe. His odd positioning makes reaching foot almost impossible. He struggles to undo the laces an remove it from his foot. With his face beet red from the force of his strain, Paul finally removes his shoe. The mere inch of leg room this creates allows him to slide his leg out from under him. The trail of alcohol is just about to come into contact w the flame -- -- but Paul deftly maneuvers his body just in time to awkwardly kick the Zippo out of the way and close the lid Paul breaths an enormous sigh of relief as he sits in the light of the damaged glow stick. He notices another hole the coffin. As a precaution, he stuffs it with the cloth that had previously been used to gag him. 56.
3) 11) dialog: (re: the phone screen) There you are. We see, on the display of the phone, that Paul has found listing of languages. He scrolls past many -- "FRANCAIS, DETSCHE, ESPANOL" -- stopping at "ENGLISH." Presses the button, instantly making all the text on the screen reada He quickly navigates to the Tools menu. Scrolls down. Locates the number of the cell phone he is using. He scribbles the number onto the top of the coffin. Then second pass, making it bolder than the others. Paul then dials his wife's cell phone. After only a few rings, he is met by her voice mail.
3) 13) dialog: Linda, here's the number for the phone. I just found it out. It's 07902-42-884. You have to use the international calling code first.
3) 16) dialog: Please call me as soon as you get this. I love you...I love you. Call me right away. Please. Paul hangs up. He looks at the battery life left on the phone. One bar. He then checks his watch. It's 8:19pm. Both are not good signs, and he knows it.
3) 17) dialog: Oh shit. He begins to panic. Grabbing the pocket knife that was le inside the metal box, he slides the blade in the space between the sides of the coffin and the top. Paul grabs the glow stick. But, because it was partially melted to the floor, the stick snaps in two. Liquid oozes out of the small portion of the stick that remains stuck floor.
3) 18) dialog: Son of a... Paul grabs the flashlight. Turns it on. It works for a second, but then goes out. Shaking it only produces intermittent beams of light. He turns the top, switching to the red bulb. It works. Th coffin fills with a reddish hue, but then it, too, goes o Growing incensed, Paul switches back to the white bulb. I works. He returns his attention to the coffin. His efforts to us the knife as a fulcrum are futile. Still, he tries. Bendi the blade well past its design, it nearly breaks off its handle. The flashlight turns off. After a good shaking, it turns back on, emitting white light. With oxygen levels extremely diminished, efforts of this are all too much for Paul to take. He has to stop and try catch his breath. As he endeavors to get his wind back, the cell phone ring Not a call this time, but instead a video message. It has been sent by Jabir. Paul's trepidation is evident. He fears what the incoming video may show. 58.
3) 24) dialog: No! No, no, no!!! Still in the throes of emotional torment, Paul vomits on himself. He doubles over, only to vomit once again. His body, taxed almost to the point of complete physical breakdown, gradually slows and levels itself. With his vo smeared face pressed cheek-down onto the bottom of the coffin, Paul stares into nothingness. 59.
3) 30) dialog: It's all a bunch of lies. 60.
3) 34) dialog: All of it.
3) 36) dialog: Nobody gives a shit about any of us. We're nothing to you people.
3) 39) dialog: By looking the other way?
3) 41) dialog: You let her die.
3) 43) dialog: They shot her...and you didn't do anything.
3) 45) dialog: She sent three videos.
3) 47) dialog: Why?
3) 49) dialog: What do you know? 61.
3) 53) dialog: I found out the number to this phone.
3) 55) dialog: I found a way to change the display language. I figured that out, and you didn't. Why?
3) 57) dialog: Then how are you ever going to find me?
3) 59) dialog: What about mine?
3) 61) dialog: I'm near a Mosque. I could hear the call to prayer over the P.A.
3) 63) dialog: You're nearby? 62.
3) 67) dialog: They're alive? After a beat:
3) 72) dialog: We had just left Anaconda, everything seemed okay. We knew that a bunch of our CB radios had been stolen and that the Iraqis were listening in, so we made sure to switch from our usual channels. Pam was riding with Jeff Breer, the convoy commander. She wanted to ride with me like she usually did when she hitched a ride from base, but it seemed safer for her to be with the C.C. As we headed down the road, all these kids came running into the street. Dozens of them. It almost seemed like they were expecting us, except we got there faster than they thought we would. So they run on up in front of me, and I slam on my brakes. The rest of the drivers were already further up ahead, so they kept going. Next thing I know, one of the lead trucks got hit by an IED. I hear Tommy Wilkes on the radio saying, Sandman's hit, Sandman's hit. He's...he's everywhere.
3) 75) dialog: That's when the Iraqis came out of their mud huts from the side of the road and started shooting everybody. I couldn't believe what was happening. It seemed like slow- motion, like I was watching it on TV. People -- my friends -- were getting killed, and all I could do is watch. I didn't even notice that the kids were throwing bricks and rocks at me until one split my windshield. Sort of snapped me out of my trance. But then, I guess I got hit in the head with a rock, `cause I blacked out.
3) 80) dialog: 
3) 83) dialog: This can't be happening. We see that Dan Brenner is no longer on the phone, and th the display menu shows an icon of a phone with a line thr it -- No Service Available. Once he feels it is secure enough, Paul slowly moves his away from the crack. Although slightly caved, it does not show any more signs of possible collapse. Sweat drenches his face. His eyes affixed, in utter disbelief, on the sand as it spills into the coffin, fill in around him inch-by-inch.
3) 85) dialog: No. Come on. Please work. He shakes the cell phone and moves it all around the coff hoping that it may somehow help. His efforts are futile. The flashlight goes dead. He hits it, shakes it. It turns back on. The brightness is diminished. Still the sand continues to fall, drowning him deeper and deeper in a pool of granules. Then, very surprisingly, the cell phone rings. Paul answe right away. 65.
3) 88) dialog: 
3) 91) dialog: Yes. Yes, this is Paul. Who are you?
3) 94) dialog: I left you a message.
3) 96) dialog: It's worse. There was an explosion or something. The coffin's breaking, there's sand pouring in from everywhere. I only have a half an hour before --
3) 98) dialog: The hostage takers, Dan Brenner from the hostage working group --
3) 102) dialog: No.
3) 104) dialog: About three inches to my right, there's a wall. Three inches to my left, there's another wall. And about four inches above my head, there's a roof that's about to collapse and drown me in sand. I think this situation is pretty contained.
3) 106) dialog: Help me! Help me! What are you going to do to help me?!
3) 109) dialog: Thank God.
3) 115) dialog: What...?
3) 118) dialog: Shit. Paul hits it, but it does not catch. He sits in darkness.
3) 120) dialog: Yes. Yes!
3) 122) dialog: Why do you need my permission? What is all this?
3) 125) dialog: Yes. Alright? Yes! Paul hits the flashlight. It turns back on.
3) 127) dialog: About nine months ago. Around January of 2005. Why are you wasting time with this? 68.
3) 131) dialog: Who cares? This is fucking crazy --
3) 133) dialog: Yes!
3) 135) dialog: You mean when I came down there to Dallas and you guys said that all of the trucks would be armored and have bulletproof glass? The flashlight dims. Paul angrily shakes it, returning it full strength.
3) 136) dialog: You mean when you told us that things were safer than ever over here? Is that when I was made aware?
3) 139) dialog: 
3) 144) dialog: Yeah, I signed a bunch of things.
3) 146) dialog: Yes. I signed the contract. Yes!
3) 148) dialog: Yes. That's completely correct. What is the point of all this?
3) 151) dialog: Wait, wait, wait -- The flashlight dims even more.
3) 154) dialog: No. Wait --
3) 158) dialog: We...we were just friends.
3) 160) dialog: This is bullshit.
3) 162) dialog: What about my insurance money? My family will need that money...
3) 164) dialog: You son of a bitch. You can't do this.
3) 167) dialog: You can't do this! Alan takes a second before trying again.
3) 172) dialog: Go to hell.
3) 174) dialog: You people can't just wash your hands of this. You bastards put me here.
3) 177) dialog: Come on...
3) 179) dialog: Answer the phone!! Paul tries Jabir once again, but still he does not answer phone. 72.
3) 182) dialog: (desperate, exhausted) Why won't you answer?!! It's then that something occurs to Paul. He stares at the crack in the top of the coffin and the sand that pours in an alarmingly fast rate. The crack has split Jabir's written phone number in half. The aerial bombing. He wonders how it may have affected Jabir and, consequently, his own chances of survival. He places his hand under the point from where the sand pours most, allowing it to collect on his palm and slip through fingers. The flickering Zippo flame tells of the diminished amount oxygen. Paul attempts to control his breathing, realizing full we that there are not many more breaths he will be able to t He then calls Dan Brenner. After a few rings, Brenner answers. Paul is surprisingly serene.
3) 184) dialog: They're dead.
3) 187) dialog: I just do.
3) 189) dialog: I know. I felt it. Did they know I was here? The Zippo flame flutters. Weakens.
3) 193) dialog: Did they care? Dan does not answer.
3) 194) dialog: These people that took me -- if they're dead, they can't tell you where I am.
3) 196) dialog: You tried that already.
3) 199) dialog: It's over, isn't it? After a long beat:
3) 203) dialog: What should I do?
3) 205) dialog: That's right -- just like everyone else on the planet, there are some things you know and some things you don't. 74.
3) 209) dialog: Yeah...me too. After a long beat, Paul ends the call. He forces a smile his lachrymose face. Utterly hopeless, he opens the phone and turns on the vid feature. He turns the phone to face himself, projecting h image on the display. He presses Record.
3) 210) dialog: This is Paul Steven Conroy. Social Security number 048-32-1198, date of birth 3/19/68. This video will serve as my last will and testament. To my wife, Linda Conroy, I leave the seven hundred dollars in my personal savings and whatever I have left in my annuity. To my son, Shane Conroy, I...I don't know. I don't have anything else. My stuff, like, my clothes. I wish I had more...I wish I had done more. Your dad wasn't really much of anything, Shane, I'm sorry. Maybe if I was a famous baseball player, or a guy who wore a suit to work, I would have more to leave you. But, you can be one of those people if you want. You can be whatever you want. Just promise me that when you get older, you'll take good care of your mom. And promise me that you'll always try to do the right thing, no matter what. I love you very much, Shane. Maybe I never said that enough...maybe I did, I don't even know. That probably means I didn't.
3) 215) dialog: You're not dead. Jabir is heard speaking frantically in Arabic to the seve other people in the room with him.
3) 216) dialog: Hello? Hello?! Jabir turns his attention to Paul.
3) 218) dialog: I don't know.
3) 221) dialog: I don't know where the money is.
3) 223) dialog: I'm not lying! I swear.
3) 225) dialog: I'm telling the truth. 76.
3) 229) dialog: I can't!
3) 231) dialog: I need more time. Please. Paul shakes and hits the flashlight. It still does not wo
3) 233) dialog: There's sand pouring in here. I can't...it's everywhere. Please, let me out of here and I will get you the money. Jabir utters something in Arabic to someone standing next him, seemingly asking a question and getting an answer fr the same individual. Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight. Switches the positioning of the batteries. Screws the cap back on. Hit the switch. Nothing. Jabir returns to the phone.
3) 235) dialog: What? Paul unscrews the top of the flashlight again. Removes th batteries. Bites down on them a few times. Blows hard inside the flashlight tube.
3) 239) dialog: No.
3) 241) dialog: I'm not doing that.
3) 243) dialog: No.
3) 245) dialog: That's right, no. You let me out of here, and I'll cut off my whole God damn hand if you want. Jabir again says something to someone in the room with hi returning to Paul after a brief moment. Paul finishes closing the top of the flashlight.
3) 248) dialog: Yes, I do. And a son. A young son. I want to go home...to see them. Please, sir.
3) 250) dialog: Yes. Sir. I say that out of respect...to you. 78.
3) 254) dialog: 
3) 257) dialog: That's...you're lying. You're nobody...all of you. You can't get to them.
3) 260) dialog: No. You're peasants, criminals, that's all. You don't even know where Michigan is.
3) 262) dialog: You looked at a map. That's all you did.
3) 265) dialog: 
3) 269) dialog: Don't stay at the house, whatever you do, do not stay at the house. The guy...the kidnapper, he knows our address. He stole my license and now he knows where we live. Go to the Sheriff's station if you have to, just don't go home. Paul hangs up. He takes a moment to look around, noticing that the coffin is almost halfway filled with sand.
3) 270) dialog: (re: the sand) Holy God. Paul then dials Dan Brenner. After only one ring, the cal goes directly to voice mail.
3) 273) dialog: Brenner, where are you?! He's alive! He just called me! Call me right away! The fucking guy is still alive! Paul hangs up the phone. Unsure what to do next, Paul's heartbeat races. He fidget nervously shaking and tapping his thumb against the phone He questions the validity of Jabir's threats toward his family.
3) 274) dialog: 
3) 279) dialog: Oh my God. Oh my God. He places his hands against the side of the coffin, sprea his fingers. He stares intently at his thumb. With the extremely sharp knife in hand, Paul slowly lower just above his thumb. He inhales and exhales deep breaths almost hyperventilating.
3) 280) dialog: Holy shit. Paul then reaches into the sand and finds one of the expi glow sticks. He shakes the sand off of it and places it across his mouth, biting into it hard. His heart races, his breaths are the deepest he's ever ta After placing the flashlight on the ground, to ensure tha the camera picks up the image, he presses the record butt on the cell phone. Grinding his teeth into the glow stick and letting out a primordial scream, Paul closes his eyes and chops down wi the knife. We see, through the display screen of the phone, Paul sev his thumb with a swift chop of the blade. 81.
3) 290) dialog: Yeah?
3) 293) dialog: I'm...here.
3) 296) dialog: You're coming?
3) 298) dialog: How do you know?
3) 303) dialog: You're coming for me?
3) 305) dialog: You have to hurry.
3) 308) dialog: No...you have to hurry. The sand...it's filling up fast.
3) 310) dialog: Okay. I believe you. Thank you. Thank you. A beep is heard. Paul has another call coming in. He's visibly elated upon seeing who it is.
3) 312) dialog: I have to go!
3) 314) dialog: Call me right back.
3) 318) dialog: Call me right back. Paul switches to the other call, despite the fact that he a mere eight inches left before the entire coffin is fill with sand from top-to-bottom. He holds the flashlight just above the top of the sand pi allowing it to illuminate what little unoccupied area remains.
3) 319) dialog: Linda. Linda is in hysterics, which is evident in her speech.
3) 321) dialog: It's me, sweetie.
3) 323) dialog: I'm...okay.

3) 344) dialog: I should have never come here. You were right. I'm sorry. 86.
3) 348) dialog: I will.
3) 350) dialog: I will. I swear I will. Paul then receives a call on the other line. He checks to see who's calling. It's Dan Brenner.

3) 400) dialog: No.
3) 402) dialog: No!! No!! NO!!! The battery life on Paul's phone runs out, causing it to power down. The filament of the flashlight bulb burns out As it does, the sand finally consumes the coffin, filling completely.
