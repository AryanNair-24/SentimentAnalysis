9) 54) dialog: Can I finish what I was saying? Tim bites his tongue.
9) 55) dialog: I think we should go on the offensive. I think heвЂ™s hoping we'll decide for him, that we'll emphatically order it. I think he canвЂ™t be an active proponent. So I'd like to present three options. A full outsourcing in all assets - essentially a radical cut. Then our option in the middle which, in contrast, looks realistic and almost harmless. And a minimal solution in just one pilot asset that changes practically nothing.
9) 57) dialog: Da Vinci.
9) 59) dialog: Argument number two is Iliescu: We have to make the point that heвЂ™s blocking us. At the end of the day, all the figures from Buzau are flawed.

13) 1) dialog: For option one we assume that it will take one year for the implementation. The implementation cost, internal and external, will be around five to six million euros. The advantage of a full outsourcing is the contractor rates. We will have a strong competition resulting in lower rates. ThatвЂ™s why we will end with a ten-per-cent cost reduction in the first year.
13) 4) dialog: Option two will take about ten months with significantly higher contractor rates. Option three takes eight months with even higher contractor rates.
13) 8) dialog: What I also think what we should put into account is that Dacoil didnвЂ™t even realize international HSSR standards in all assets. So we donвЂ™t have a business case yet. But a very strong trend. You all agreed that the implementation of any option will not be done faster than one year, which is also in line with HR.
