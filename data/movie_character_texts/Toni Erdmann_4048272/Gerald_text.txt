9) 51) dialog: OK, that comes as a surprise.
9) 58) dialog: Right now, IвЂ™m not convinced...
9) 62) dialog: Illiescu isnвЂ™t an issue for the steering committee. We'll put this in a comfort zone. The three options are OK if you really feel confident.

13) 10) dialog: Absolutely.
13) 13) dialog: OK, I absolutely agree with Mr. Dascalu that there are many open questions. There is a lot that needs to be analyzed in more detail. But I would like to support Ms. Conradi. From my point of view at least option 2 is necessary. The big picture will not change and is absolutely in line with my experiences from other countries. Thank you, Ines. (addressing Henneberg) So now we need directions, Titus.

13) 23) dialog: I donвЂ™t like that you donвЂ™t stick to the plan. The Iliescu thing wasnвЂ™t exactly elegant. The next steps are clear. But please inform me if there are any more problems.
