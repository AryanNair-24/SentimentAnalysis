T.J. can seen being loaded into an AMBULANCE. The hanger doors slide shut with a THUD. We see Xander's HANDS as the CHAINS are cut away. Xander sits in a chair with the BLACK HOOD still over his head. He blinks when the hood is torn off. A Black Ops So smirks as he walks away. Xander looks around, sees the Black Ops Team unpacking so STRANGE GEAR. Two of them are dumping bottles of a CLEAR  LIQUID into a RUSTY CLAWFOOT BATHTUB.
