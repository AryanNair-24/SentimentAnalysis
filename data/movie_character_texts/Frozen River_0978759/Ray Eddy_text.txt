3) 0) text: RAY EDDY, 38, a bit worn for her years, with a long red ponytail, wearing an old bathrobe, sits in the passenger seat of her RED PLYMOUTH HORIZON with the door open, smoking a cigarette, thinking. Her breath is visible in the cold morning air. Her bare feet rest on the cold ground. Her 1970's rusted out TRAILER HOME SITS in front of her on CINDER BLOCKS AT A SLIGHT TILT. Beside it, a small SHED and behind it the CONCRETE FOUNDATION FOR A HOUSE. Around her, the yard is littered with junk: a rusted ski lift chair, the front end of a Plymouth Duster and a SMILING DUCK Kiddie Ride. Beyond the yard, flat, winterbare land. After a moment, a lanky boy of 15, her son, TROY, JR., leans out the trailer door.

3) 36) dialog: I just can't do it anymore.
3) 38) dialog: T.J., we can't make him stop.
3) 40) dialog: It's not stealing if you take it from your family. Anyway, he made some of it, too.
3) 42) dialog: I'm sorry. In the distance the RUMBLE OF TRUCKS. Ray hears it. It gets louder.
4) 0) text: She looks around the cramped trailer at the oversized RENTAWORLD furniture including a big screen TV. An enlarged wall photograph of the family catches her eye. In it, her husband, TROY, SR., 40, wearing a forced smile, his long, shaggy hair combed flat for the picture. Ray hurries down the hall to her bedroom and takes off her bathrobe -- she has several tatoos -- and slides into a pair or jeans and a t-shirt.

5) 15) text: Call me when you have the balloon payment. He makes a circle in the air with his hand and the semi's rev their engines and grind into reverse. RAY
5) 17) text: Wait, where are they going? She takes his face in her hands. RAY
5) 19) text: But why are they leaving? RAY
5) 21) text: That's our house! He BREAKS AWAY from her and RUNS down the road chasing after the semis. Ray chases after Ricky until he runs out of steam and stops, panting. She catches up to him and tries to hug him. He pushes her away. She gets down on her knees and takes his face in her hands. RAY
5) 22) text: We're gonna get it back. She picks him up and walks back to the trailer. Ricky looks out mournfully at the trailers disappearing down the road. RAY (CONT'D)

7) 5) dialog: What is that?
7) 8) dialog: When I started you said it would be six months before I could come on full-time. And that was two years ago. He opens a can of RED BULL and takes a sip.
7) 10) dialog: Well, I mean, you know, I do show up. Pat's late everyday. She's late now. She's always late. He stares blankly at her. She can think of nothing else to say. He walks out. Ray resumes unpacking ponies. A moment later PAT, 22, rushes in, looking sorry. As Pat hangs up her coat, Ray glimpses a tatoo just above her low riding pants with the words "How You Doin'?". Ray takes the last of her cigarettes out of the pack and heads out the back door.
7) 11) dialog: See ya' tomorrow.

14) 3) dialog: (points to the Acclaim)
14) 6) dialog: You stole it.
