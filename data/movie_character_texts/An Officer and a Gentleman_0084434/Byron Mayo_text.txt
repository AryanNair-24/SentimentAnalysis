13) 17) dialog: I don't believe this! You... in the  Navy... an officer... that's like me  saying I'm running for fucking  president. Hey, man, look at you!  Hey, officers don't have tattoos!
13) 21) dialog: Don't be pissed. I'm on your side,  Pard. I just don't want you to do  something you'll regret. You gotta  give six years to the Navy if you  wanna fly... that's six years with  the most uptight assholes God put on  this earth. Officers aren't like you  and me, man. It's another breed.

73) 21) dialog: I wrote. Not every week...
73) 23) dialog: I never said any of that!
73) 25) dialog: (beat) Okay, I wrote those things... and  yeah, I had big thoughts of getting  together with your mom... but when  she hit me with being pregnant, I  saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay  that shit on me before!
