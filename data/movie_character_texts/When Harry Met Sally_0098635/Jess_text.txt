I say, why don't we think about it, take some time, don’t rush into anything. * Next day she says she's thought about it, she wants a trial separation. She just wants to try it, she says. We can still date, she says, like this is supposed to cushion the blow. I mean, I got married so I could stop dating, so I don't see where “we can still date" is a big incentive since as far as I'm concerned the last thing you want to do is date your wife, who's supposed to love you, which is what I'm saying to her when it crosses my mind maybe she doesn't, so I say, "Don't you love me anymore?“ and you know what she says?
