Two faded yellow buses stand ready. The lull is shattered by the CLANGING of the final BELL. A swarm of children pours out the door and down the broad front steps, scattering across the lawn toward the cars and the buses. Moving slowly through the crowd, ROBIN and ALEX HAMMOND, nine-year-old identical twins, appear at the doorway.. Attractive, dark-haired children, they seem more sub- dued than the others. As they walk quietly down the stairs, Robin lags behind, staring at a boy teasing a girl nearby. He is NICK MCBRIDE, eleven years old, two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in school. The pretty girl laughing at his antics is KIM HAMMOND, also eleven, Robin's older sister.

Crashing into Lou, he drives the larger boy back into the salad counter, sending food and utensils flying. As they tumble off the counter onto the floor, Alex gets in several furious punches before Lou's gang can pry him loose. Two of the gang pin Alex against the counter. Wiping blood from his mouth, Lou grins maliciously and slugs Alex in the stomach. The boy groans and doubles over. Lou grabs Alex's hair and slams his head back against the glass shield of the counter. As Lou rears back to throw another punch, his two friends suddenly release Alex and scatter. The boy crumples to the floor. Lou turns around to see two MALE TEACHERS rapidly approaching. The larger teacher grabs Lou. TEACHER

60) 4) text: My mother's all upset, as usual. My father too... he doesn't show it so much... It's hard to get over something like that. Robin would have been a junior, like Alex. This would've been her first prom... I guess that's'why it seems so much worse this year... She stops, turns and faces Nick. It's hard for him to meet her gaze. KIM (CONTINUING)
61) 3) text: We have to get back. She stands, with her husband's support. Kim and Alex are standing quietly at the foot of the grave. Vivian looks at them both. Her eyes hold a terrible rage, a terrible sadness. Hammond carefully guides her away. Kim has a flower of her own, a white rose, which she drops on her sister's grave. She turns, meets Alex's stare, moves off after her parents. Alex remains a mo- ment longer, then. he, too, goes.

94) 5) text: You like? ALEX
94) 8) text: You want to help or just leer? ALEX
94) 10) text: Pin this on me, you creep, late. Alex takes the corsage. As he attaches the bright red flower on her gown, she playfully dabs perfume on his neck. He pulls back, pricking himself on the pin. ALEX
94) 16) text: er's face is revealed. It is the nine-year-old Alex. Kim cradles the killer on the ground. She turns his head toward the light. We SEE his face full-on. VIVIA N
94) 17) text: Robin! She rushes forward, lunging for the body. Hammond grabs her, restraining her. Alex's dark eyes stare back unseeing at his family. His resemblance to his dead twin sister is uncanny. His hair falls onto his forehead in bangs, as Robin's had done seven years before. His makeup has been slop- pily applied. The rouged cheeks and the smudged red lips amplify the grotesque impersonation. Kim strokes her brother's hair. Hammond presses his hysterical wife to him. The onlookers slowly close in. We SLOWLY DISSOLVE FROM Alex's face TO a photograph of the Hammond family taken seven years earlier. We MOVE IN CLOSE ON the twins. Alex and Robin are smiling. FADE OUT. THE END
