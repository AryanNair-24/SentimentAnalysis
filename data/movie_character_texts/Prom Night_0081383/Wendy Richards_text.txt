2) 0) text: Robin climbs up onto the floor and peers into the dark, gloomy structure. Suddenly, she hears a SHRIEK. Ter- rified, she backs against a wall. LAUGHTER FOLLOWS im- mediately and Robin hears Kelly's VOICE TAKING UP the chant. As the three "killers" move through the vast structure searching for Wendy, "KILL, KILT" ECHOES off the walls and hardwood floors. Robin cautiously steps out of the doorway into the im- mense unfinished lobby. Ominous shadows slash across the floor as the excited girl listens to the relentless CHANTING of the children. Robin pushes on a makeshift wooden door. It slips off its temporary hinges, crashing down to the floor. The NOISE is like a rifle shot; suddenly, there is ABSOLUTE SILENCE in the structure. Petrified, Robin crouches behind a wall, waiting. The CHANTING quickly RESUMES and she breathes a long sigh of relief. Robin moves through a dark corridor, hugging the walls. Flushed with excitement, she imagines herself a "killer" searching for Wendy. As she moves past an empty room, she hears a SOFT GIGGLE. Robin stops and listens care- fully. Once again she hears the GIGGLE, LOUDER this time, coming from nearby. Stepping to a doorway, she leans around the corner and peers inside. In the darkness she can see nothing. Gathering her courage, she quietly slips into the room. The room appears empty but a closet door is slightly ajar. As Robin approaches, she hears a FAINT GASP from behind her. Whirling around, she sees Wendy crouched behind a cardboard box in the corner.

As her eyes adjusts to the darkness, she spies a rickety ladder extending through a hole in the floor to the basement below. Stacked up- right near the opening are several sheets of window glass. Before Robin can make a move towards the lad- der, she hears a horrible SCREECH and Wendy appears in the doorway, a vicious look on her face.

The hand stops, moves across an open page to a smiling head shot of Nick McBride. The hand rips the picture from the page, sets it down on a plain wooden desk alongside three other pictures -with similar torn edges. The other pictures are of Jude Cunningham, Kelly Lynch, and Wendy Richards. The yearbook is slammed shut.
