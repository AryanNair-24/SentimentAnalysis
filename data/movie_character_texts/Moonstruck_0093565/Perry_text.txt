I started off, I was excited  about something and I wanted to share  it. Now it's rote, it's the  multiplication table. Except  sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning  along and I look up, and there's  this fresh young beautiful face, and  it's all new to her and I'm this  great guy who's just brilliant and  thinks out loud. And when that  happens, when I look out among those  chairs and look at a young woman's  face, and see me there in her eyes,  me the way I always wanted to be and  maybe once was, then I ask her out  on a date. It doesn't last. It can  go for a few weeks or a couple of  precious months, but then she catches  on that I'm just a burnt out old  gasbag and that she's as fresh and  bright and full of promise as  moonlight in a martini. And at that  moment, she stands up and throws a  glass of water in my face, or some  action to that effect.
