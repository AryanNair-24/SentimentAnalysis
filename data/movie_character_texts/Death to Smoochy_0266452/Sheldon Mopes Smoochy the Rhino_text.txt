The half-lit neon sign reads: CONEY ISLAND METHADONE CENTER. We DRIFT THROUGH the double doors THROUGH the reception area where random junkies loiter and fill out paperwork. We CONTINUE DOWN a narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone SINGING and playing the GUITAR INCREASES. We finally burst THROUGH another set of doors marked "Treatment Room." The singing now fills our ears as we PUSH IN ON the "performer" -- a big, puffy, orange rhinoceros. Smoochy. Or to be more specific, SHELDON MOPES.
9) 5) text: Thanks, fellas. I'm rooting for you! We PAN AWAY FROM Sheldon TO the exit.      Standing there her coat, looking mortified, is Nora.

11) 6) text: Believe it or not, no. He takes another bite. SHELDON
11) 7) text: So anyway, like I was saying, people always tell me, 'You gotta network, Sheldon... you gotta sell yourself... or you'll be playing the drug clinics and shopping centers the rest of your life.' And you know what I tell 'em? NORA
11) 8) text: I haven't the foggiest. SHELDON
11) 9) text: I tell 'em, it's not about the old handshake and back slap game. It's not about adding fuel to the shlock machine. It's about doing good work. Having integrity. Making people happy and delivering a positive message. Foundations are built with concrete, not plaster of Paris! He pulls the stained, misshapen Smoochy head from the shopping bag. SHELDON

Sheldon stands on a wooden box as he's measured from head to toe. On the wall is a blueprint labeled "Smoochy the Rhino -- REDESIGN." A costume designer walks over with the new Smoochy head and places it on Sheldon. As seamstresses fit him with the new Smoochy costume, various signs and billboards FLOAT THROUGH the FRAME, trumpeting copy like: "IT'S ALMOST SMOOCHY TIME!"
14) 2) text: The wind-up Smoochy lays upside-down on the carpet next to Nora's desk, legs grinding lamely in the air. Various Smoochy items are spread out on her desk top. A restless-looking Sheldon and a few members of Nora's staff are in on the meeting. NORA
14) 3) text: Again, these are just prototypes. I've been assured by FunZone that all the bugs will be worked out before Christmas. Sheldon raises his hand.   Nora ignores him and looks at her watch. NORA

Those guys didn't care about bells and whistles and rickita-rackata. It was all about the work. Especially Jesus. Forget about it. The Bartender nods and starts to pour Sheldon another drink. SHELDON

17) 3) text: You know, years ago, a client of mine, Dicky Gimble, was having a problem... SHELDON
17) 5) text: Yeah, before the asshole found religion. Anyway, Stokes was trying to screw my boy out of some merchandising points. Claimed he had a warehouse full of Dicky dolls that weren't moving. Now Frank and I are old friends, so I say to him, 'Okay, cock, show me the warehouse' -- see, I know the fucking warehouse is in the Bronx, and I know it's emptier than my wife's head. (chuckles) To make a long story short, I walk out with a check for a hundred grand and Stokes is sitting there with his thumb up his ass. Burke laughs. SHELDON
17) 11) text: Shel, it's all about the dough. After you get the money, you get the power. And after you get the power, you can have Smoochy walk on stage with a hard-on if you want. SHELDON

20) 13) dialog: We have different eyes, Nora. When I go out there I see kids. You see wallets with pigtails. He moves on. Nora stares at him as he walks away. He obviously got to her. As Sheldon heads toward the studio, he doesn't notice the two beady eyes staring at him from under the stairwell. After a beat, Randolph emerges and slinks backstage. He's clutching a duffle bag.
22) 23) dialog: What a special day with such special cookies!
24) 2) text: Burke sits on the couch next to Sheldon, reading the paper. He shakes his head in disgust. Nora sits in a chair near Stokes. SHELDON
24) 3) text: Thank you all for coming. I just wanted to iron out a few wrinkles I feel we're having in the communication department. No finger-pointing. Lord knows when you start pointing fingers, someone gets poked in the eye. Sheldon laughs.    Stokes and Nora sit stone-faced. SHELDON
24) 4) text: Anyhoo, I'd like to turn the floor over to my new agent, Mr. Burke Bennett. So... heeeeeere's Burke! Sheldon applauds.    Burke stands. BURKE

25) 10) text: It's called the high life, kid. Get used to it. Pretty soon you'll be burnin' one hundred dollar bills just to see Franklin break a sweat. SHELDON
25) 11) text: Jeez, I hope not. I have a deep respect for money. Not to mention Ben Franklin who had some remarkable achievements in his lifetime. Burke pulls out a paper bag and hands it to Sheldon. SHELDON
25) 13) text: That's your graduation present. Something you're gonna need now. Sheldon reaches in the bag and pulls out a revolver. He recoils in horror and immediately drops it back in the bag.
25) 17) text: Think of it as a tool of the trade. SHELDON
25) 19) text: Trust me, Shel. It's a handy accessory in this business. Even if you don't load it, have it for show. Sometimes that's all you need. Especially with a creep like Randolph lurking around. Burke and Sheldon look up and notice the hulking, grinning figure of SPINNER DUNN standing over them. Spinner has the smile of a little boy despite his crooked nose and scarred face. He extends his hand. SPINNER
25) 20) text: Hiya, Smoochy! I'm Spinner! Spinner! SHELDON

33) 10) text: You know, a little part on the show. You're the executive producer now. You call the shots, right? SHELDON
33) 11) text: Uh, that's a very sweet offer, and I love Spinner, but TV is a complicated medium and... I mean, that would be like me getting into the ring with a prizefighter. (laughs) Can you imagine such a thing? Boom. K.O.! What's the alphabet, Mommy? Sheldon laughs again.       Tommy gets quiet. TOMMY
33) 16) text: I don't want to mention names. The guys look menacingly at Sheldon. They rise and walk around his desk until they're on either side of him.
33) 20) text: You know what? Maybe I can find Spinner a little something to do on the show. That's probably the best solution. Tommy now smiles and walks over to Sheldon.       She mus Sheldon's hair. TOMMY

78) 20) dialog: I guess I'm still readjusting a little. Like a guy who's come back from the war. Not that I'd equate my misfortune with the brave men and women who protect us overseas.
85) 4) dialog: It's my fault. He'd still be alive if it wasn't for me. He would have been so proud to be in the ice show. NORA

88) 22) text: Here, I got you some crossword puzzles and stuff to read. Angelo hops off the conveyor belt and turns on the hot plate. He starts to open a can of soup. Randolph reaches into the bag and pulls out a copy of the New York Post. The lead article's headline reads, "WAKE FOR SPINNER." A large photograph shows mourners leaving the restaurant after the wake. Clearly visible are Sheldon and Nora. They have their arms around each other. Randolph's eyes widen. He starts to hyperventilate. Angelo looks up. ANGELO

89) 5) dialog: Are you sure? The cops have tons of evidence on Randolph.

93) 25) dialog: Oh good Lord in Heaven.
93) 29) dialog: I... uh... read once that the best way to diffuse a tense situation is with a little humor. To that end, would you like to hear a funny joke?
93) 39) dialog: I'm telling you, you'd love this joke. It revolves around Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny getting into a fender bender. Nora rolls her eyes and goes to the bar.
93) 43) dialog: We'll go to the police, first thing tomorrow... straighten everything out.
93) 50) text: (to tune of 'Ol' MacDonald) 'Rainbow Randolph is the man. Yes he, yes he, is. He's the Prez of Rainbowland. Yes he, yes he, is. With some fun, fun here, and a laugh, laugh there. Here a dance, there a song, Everything is fun, fun. Rainbow Randolph is the King, the King of Rainbowland!' Randolph takes another drink from the vodka bottle. Sheldon suddenly lunges at Randolph and tries to grab the gun. Randolph shrieks. The two men wrestle on the floor, but Randolph is not much of a fighter. He screams as Sheldon rolls him toward the fireplace. SHELDON
93) 52) text: Stop! It's too hot!    The heat! It's driving me mad! Randolph rolls Sheldon to the bottom. Nora reaches for a fireplace poker and whacks Randolph with it.

93) 54) text: You're not nothing. You're bitter, misguided and I'm guessing a raging alcoholic, but you're still Rainbow Randolph. Despite everything that's happened, you once made children happy. Randolph sits up and looks at Sheldon through watery eyes.
93) 58) text: Would you be my friend? SHELDON

94) 25) text: He's the real thing. Smoochy's the real thing. And I've been a fraud. A wicked man doing wicked acts. Sheldon slaps the cylinder into place and tucks the gun in his waistband. SHELDON

104) 36) text: Sheldon!!! Get down!!!
104) 40) text: Everyone in the arena screams and heads for the exits. It's pandemonium. Thanks to Randolph, Buggy's shot was too high and just missed Sheldon's skull.

108) 15) text: I'm not Smoochy. Sheldon is shaking as he extends the gun to Burke's head. SHELDON
108) 23) text: (sternly) Stay out of it, Tommy.   This is my business. Tommy walks closer to Sheldon. TOMMY
108) 24) text: No more killin', Shel. Enough's enough. Don't destroy who you are for this piece of shit. You mean something to the kids. Don't take Smoochy away from the kids. Tommy extends her hand for the gun. Sheldon looks down at the gun. He can't believe he's even holding it. He hands it to Tommy.

108) 27) text: We'll take it from here, kid, you run along with your girl. Get on with your life. Sheldon looks over at Burke, who's petrified.
