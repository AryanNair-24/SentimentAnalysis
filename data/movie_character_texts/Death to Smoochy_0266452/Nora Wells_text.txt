8) 5) text: Skippy Black and the Tippy Trolls? NORA
8) 6) text: Black was deported, and the trolls... well, who gives a shit. Nora kicks the table in frustration.
8) 11) text: Before indulging such cheery fantasies, let's just concentrate on saving my job. Shall we? NORA
8) 13) text: What's going on with Sheldon Mopes these days. Nora laughs. NORA
8) 15) text: Sap's just the pill we need right now. Mopes is a straight arrow. Always has been. NORA
8) 22) text: And each one a moral question mark. Something I can't risk at the moment. NORA
8) 24) text: Except ethics. With Mopes, there's never been a whiff of controversy. The man's an ethical, harmless, cornball. In short, a glass of milk on two legs. Stokes stops pacing. NORA
9) 5) text: Thanks, fellas. I'm rooting for you! We PAN AWAY FROM Sheldon TO the exit.      Standing there her coat, looking mortified, is Nora.
10) 0) text: Nora sits in the reception area. Sheldon emerges in his street clothes. He carries Smoochy's body on a hanger over his shoulder and carries a large shopping bag which holds Smoochy's head. NORA
10) 7) text: Really? Thanks. I would've done a longer set if that guy hadn't pulled a knife on the security guard. Once the pepper spray starts flyin', that's it for the encores. NORA
10) 9) text: Are you a new patient?   On the juice, as we say? NORA
10) 12) text: Good gravy. You work for Kidnet? NORA
10) 14) text: Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Nora. A real honor. Hey, you hungry?
11) 5) text: (with full mouth) Soy dogs... never thought I'd live to see the day. Organic, rich in natural protein, and nobody gets killed. Although I do feel bad for the beans. Just kidding. Sure you don't want one? NORA
11) 7) text: So anyway, like I was saying, people always tell me, 'You gotta network, Sheldon... you gotta sell yourself... or you'll be playing the drug clinics and shopping centers the rest of your life.' And you know what I tell 'em? NORA
11) 10) text: This is concrete!   This is integrity! NORA
11) 17) text: See, I was raised by my grandfather, and Grandpop paved driveways for a living... NORA
11) 19) text: Thing is, he didn't really pave them. Just covered them with black paint. Of course, once the first rain came along, people realized they'd been swindled. I vowed to myself back then that I'd never make a living through deception. Never. Whadda ya think of them apples? Nora looks glassy-eyed.      She takes a deep breath. NORA
11) 20) text: The reason I'm here today, Mr. Mopes, as fate would have it, Kidnet is currently looking for a performer with... convictions. And integrity. Someone like... She almost chokes on the word. NORA
11) 22) text: Yeah, right. Got any more jokes? NORA
11) 29) text: I knew this day   would come! After all these   years I finally meet someone in   the business who gets what I do.    Who gets what I'm all about. You    get me, don't you, Nora? NORA
14) 2) text: The wind-up Smoochy lays upside-down on the carpet next to Nora's desk, legs grinding lamely in the air. Various Smoochy items are spread out on her desk top. A restless-looking Sheldon and a few members of Nora's staff are in on the meeting. NORA
14) 3) text: Again, these are just prototypes. I've been assured by FunZone that all the bugs will be worked out before Christmas. Sheldon raises his hand.   Nora ignores him and looks at her watch. NORA
14) 5) text: Okay, time out, people! If I may interject, I think we're putting the cart before the horse here... Nora throws him an icy look.
14) 9) text: Smoochy's still earning the trust of the kids. We don't want to compromise that by asking them to buy shampoo and cheese. How 'bout we just concentrate on doing the best show possible. Huh? Without all the bells and whistles and rickata-rackita. What do you say, guys? Nora casually picks up a Smoochy Frisbee from her desk and sails it toward the open door. It lands in the hallway. NORA
14) 11) text: No problem, I'll get it. He walks out to the hallway. NORA
14) 12) text: (to staffer) Shut the door please, John. John shuts the door. NORA

15) 5) text: Good meeting today. I thought we tackled some hot issues. Although, I'll be honest, there were a few times that I felt my voice wasn't being heard. NORA
15) 7) text: I just want the show to have some weight, you know? Some substance. Silly songs, sure -- but with a message. Pop quiz: How many original compositions are in the Smoochy songbook? NORA
15) 9) text: Try two thousand. Covering every topic from how yummy vegetables are to the importance of donating plasma. Don't you get it, Nora? I'm a valuable resource. Use me. Nora stops.    She looks Sheldon in the eye for the first time. NORA
15) 11) text: Sure. NORA
20) 2) text: Excuse me, Nora. Why was the 'Please and Thank You Song' cut? NORA
20) 7) text: Takes away? It enhances it! The cookie song is a meaningless piece of fluff without the 'Please and Thank You' coda! That's the moral anchor! That's where the lesson is! You can't sell the sizzle without the steak! NORA
20) 9) text: I can't do that. I will not condone children consuming endless amounts of refined sugar. I have to look myself in the mirror every morning. NORA
20) 11) text: You're treating me like a puppet. You know that? Well, guess what? I am not your puppet. NORA
22) 8) dialog: She looks pissed, but then looks over at the kids in the bleachers. Their faces are filled with laughter. For the first time she feels the connection Smoochy has with them.
24) 2) text: Burke sits on the couch next to Sheldon, reading the paper. He shakes his head in disgust. Nora sits in a chair near Stokes. SHELDON
24) 3) text: Thank you all for coming. I just wanted to iron out a few wrinkles I feel we're having in the communication department. No finger-pointing. Lord knows when you start pointing fingers, someone gets poked in the eye. Sheldon laughs.    Stokes and Nora sit stone-faced. SHELDON
24) 9) text: See this guy, Frank? Take a good long look, 'cause this prick saved your life. Without him you'd be sitting in Kaplan's right now, sucking club soda through a paper straw. (to Nora) And, you -- you'd be organizing puppet shows for the brats at P.S. 86. Excuse me, honey. NORA
24) 21) text: To be fair, Nora, I was booked to open a car wash in Montauk. BURKE
30) 0) text: Sheldon whistles as he walks down the hall, giving cheerful "hellos" and "good mornings" along the way.   He enters Nora's office.
31) 0) text: Nora is on the phone. She pretends not to notice him. Sheldon bides his time by inspecting knickknacks, examining photos on the wall, etc. Finally, he half- whispers/half-mouths to her: SHELDON
31) 1) text: Whenever you get a chance... I just need a second. NORA
31) 3) text: I'm sorry, you didn't have to hang up. NORA
31) 5) text: But I am still here. NORA
31) 7) text: Nora, I want us to start off on the right foot. I want you to know that I value your input and I don't want you to feel intimidated just because the power structure has changed a bit. I consider you a partner. NORA
31) 14) text: Fair enough. If you change your mind -- NORA
36) 1) text: You better grow eyes on the back of your fucking head, you horned piece of shit! I won't sleep until the worms are crawlin' up your foam rubber ass! I'm going on safari, motherfucker... safari! Sheldon hangs up stunned.       Nora walks in holding the news.
36) 2) dialog: Congratulations on your little ice show.
36) 4) dialog: It didn't take you long to sell out, did it? She tosses the paper on his desk.
36) 5) dialog: What happened to your precious integrity? Or was that just part of your dog and pony act. She exits.    A confused Sheldon looks at the "Around Tow column.
39) 7) dialog: Nice job. Casting the show with mental patients, I like that.
39) 10) dialog: Excuse me for not making the distinction. She leaves.
42) 4) text: The real one. My advice? Consider the ice show and stay healthy. Burke hangs up. After a beat, Sheldon's DOORBELL RINGS. He walks over to the door and opens it. To his surprise, Nora is standing there. NORA
42) 6) text: Sure. Nora enters. She seems a little wobbly.    Sheldon notice she's holding a pint of whiskey. SHELDON
42) 7) text: Uh... are you okay? NORA
42) 9) text: Oh. Well, not to make you feel worse, but with alcohol you're also consuming empty calories. Nora looks at him for a moment.
42) 14) text: Wow.   I'm honored. Nora trips slightly.     Sheldon takes the whiskey from h SHELDON
42) 15) text: Why don't we get some air? He leads her out on the balcony.    They look out at the city. NORA
42) 17) text: Well, it wasn't as bad as the week before when you called me a pasty- faced, no-talent hack. NORA
42) 19) text: I guess I didn't want to spoil your fun. You look so content when you're berating me. Nora looks down. NORA
42) 25) text: 'Sometimes light is really dark, Sometimes crows can sing like larks Sometimes Winter feels like Spring, Don't think you know everything.' NORA
42) 27) text: You remember Rickets? NORA
42) 29) text: That's how I felt! Rickets had real depth. He was my inspiration for Smoochy. NORA
42) 31) text: I can't believe it. I never met anyone who even remembers Rickets. Do you remember the Klunky-Wunky dance? NORA
42) 32) text: Remember it?   I did it at my first communion. Sheldon starts doing the rather insane-looking Klunky- Wunky dance. Nora does it with him. They both stop and look at each other. Sheldon impulsively leans in and kisses her. SHELDON
42) 33) text: I'm sorry. That was a mistake, right? I didn't mean for that to hap-- Nora grabs his head and pulls it toward her.       They b kissing passionately.
42) 38) text: No, no. NORA
42) 40) text: Yes, yes. NORA
42) 42) text: Shhh... you don't have to explain... They continue to kiss.      Nora abruptly stops. NORA
42) 44) text: Why? Nora exits the balcony and collects her coat and purse. SHELDON
42) 45) text: What's wrong? Is it the whiskey? If you have to throw up, be my guest. Anywhere you like. NORA
42) 46) text: It's just getting late. Sheldon follows her to the door. She stops and looks at him for a moment. The PHONE starts to RING. Neither of them says anything for a beat. NORA

53) 6) text: Don't tell me you believe what they're saying! NORA
53) 8) text: Perform?     I barely sang one song. NORA
53) 10) text: Nora, I had no idea that was a Nazi function. None whatsoever! NORA
53) 12) text: The papers are blowing that out of proportion. It was nowhere near that big. Nora stops and looks Sheldon in the eye. NORA
53) 14) text: But what about the balcony? What about the Klunky-Wunky dance? NORA
58) 13) text: You're dealing with an honorable culture, Frank. We know how to play ball. Stokes unzips the bag and gazes at the money.     He look up at Chick and smiles. STOKES
59) 0) text: On Nora's TV screen, we see the black and white image of Rickets the Hippo doing the "Klunky-Wunky Dance." Nora sits on the couch and stares hypnotically at the screen. There is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up and ejects the "Best of Rickets" tape. She opens the door. To her surprise, Randolph is standing there. RANDOLPH
59) 6) text: Ahhh. Who do ya gotta blow to get a Scotch around here? He laughs. NORA
59) 8) text: Dammit, Nora! The rhino's gone! You need that slot filled and I'm ready to reclaim what's rightfully mine. NORA
59) 10) text: Okay, so maybe I commandeered a stray shekel or two. Big deal! Compared to what Smoochy did that's like jerking off in the supermarket. NORA
59) 17) text: Why we broke up I'll never know. NORA
59) 20) text: Damn it, Nora! The public is clamoring for me! I'm a fucking patriot! Mopes is a Nazi! He's evil! He's probably even gay! You should've seen the way he was checking me out in the car! NORA
59) 22) text: What does what mean? NORA
59) 24) text: No... it's just a vibe! A Nazi homosexual vibe! It emanates from the television! The whole Smoochy costume... with the erect horn... I mean, what's that all about? Nora starts to walk closer to him.       He backs up. NORA
59) 30) text: Were you at that rally? Tell me! Did you have something to do with this? She backs him against the wall and looks him in the eye. NORA

The kids pour out of the bleachers onto the jungle set. Everyone is dancing and having a ball. Nora is clapping to the music offstage. Sheldon and Nora exchange affectionate glances.
78) 6) text: Great!    I get to hit something! Spinner dances off. A beat later, Nora enters and shuts the door. There's an awkward beat of silence. NORA

78) 10) text: Yeah, the papers seem to be really covering it. NORA
78) 12) text: Thanks. She nods. NORA

Burke tries to grab her, but she spins around and punches him. She runs for the rink. Stokes stands in the box looking dumbstruck as pande- monium plays out around him. People are running in all directions, cops are everywhere. STOKES
