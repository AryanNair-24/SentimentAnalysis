The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. An plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and tinsel occupies a lonely corner. Next to that, a faded diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. The kind you might order o the Shopping Network. Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine stained fingers of his right hand. Must be a nervous habi You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer drinker. Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-hand dexterity. You do get pretty good at this sort of thing w your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK. dog tags around his neck tell the story. His white cook's hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat.

Told her when they finally ran the freeway through here like they were plannin' on, this place would be like Grand Central Station. (BEAT) But I was wrong. The freeway never came and now the only people who ever stop here are the ones who are lost. (BEAT) And your mom? Well she got tired of waitin'.

11) 18) dialog: You know this was the top-of-the- line model when I bought it.
11) 20) dialog: You shouldn't be watchin' anyways. (rubs his hands together) Okay, baby, this is gonna do it.
11) 21) text: Bob gives the TV one final wallop -- WHACK! And the picture snaps into FOCUS.    Only it isn't the pi he was expecting. The STARK GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCASTING SYSTEM an its accompanying HOLLOW TONE fill the diner. Everybody in the place stops and turns to the TV.

15) 32) text: Sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of t response. The fly that was circling her head, now lands on GLADYS'S FACE. It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in least. Howard and Sandra exchange looks.    Creepy. The door JINGLES and Jeep walks in. He heads straight for quiet huddle with Bob. All the while though, he keeps one eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the Andersons. Something about her...

Gladys is a real horror show. Bones jut out at obtuse ang from her neck -- a result of the blow to her head from Percy's frying pan.
22) 6) dialog: She's cold as a freakin' ice cube. If I hadn't just seen her walk in here, I'd say the old bag's been dead for hours.
22) 7) text: Bob rolls Gladys over, revealing her face -- her enlarged mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth.
23) 0) text: Bob, Kyle and Jeep quickly drag Gladys's body wrapped in plastic table cloth a short ways from the diner. They war eye the curtain of FLIES no more than a hundred yards out
23) 5) dialog: I don't get it.    Why don't they come closer?
23) 11) dialog: You see anything?
23) 14) dialog: Careful. Old lady could have some kind of rabid poodle locked up in there.
23) 17) text: Bob covers his nose.
23) 18) dialog: Jesus.
23) 26) text: They go around to the BACK OF THE CAR.   Jeep slips the k in. The trunk POPS open, revealing a PILE OF DEAD CATS.   ROT MAGGOT INFESTED. Bob quickly slams the trunk closed.    The guys are reeli with disgust. Kyle's trying to blow the stench from his nose.
23) 28) dialog: Least now we know where that smell was coming from.

25) 17) dialog: Okay... Suppose you tell us your name then.
25) 19) dialog: Sorry about all that, Michael. This old lady just went crazy inside my place here. She had these teeth. Never seen anything like `em. Practically bit a man in half.
25) 21) dialog: So what are you doin' out here? Gotta say you don't exactly look like a police officer. Even one from L.A. Then again, you have to be, right? I mean, who the hell'd be crazy enough to steal a cop car?
25) 22) text: Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond i kind, Bob falls silent. Anxious. He slowly raises the shotgun again. Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. The plast table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. Turning back to Bob
25) 33) dialog: Back off, fella... (BEAT) Now, I don't care if this is the second coming of Jesus fucking Christ, I say it's time for you to either get talkin' or get the hell outta here!
25) 34) text: In a BLUR OF MOVEMENT, Michael rips the shotgun from Bob' hands. It all happens so fast that Bob is stunned to find himself holding air. He's even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun pressed to the bridge of his nose. Everyone freezes.
25) 38) text: But Bob can't even speak, he's so scared.   He squeezes h eyes closed.
25) 50) text: Michael whips the gun away from Bob's head and thrusts it back into his hands. Bob's looks down at the gun, speechless.

25) 72) dialog: C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go!
25) 76) text: And Bob rushes into the diner. A moment as Jeep looks out toward the road. THE HEADLIGHTS ARE GROWING BRIGHTER.       CLOSER. He contemplates the sub-machine gun in his hands.
26) 12) dialog: Jeep, get the flashlights!
