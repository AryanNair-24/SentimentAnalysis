In a booth, Audrey watches, red-eyed, as Michael restrain her mother. Then she returns her attention to Percy's rad Tuning. Trying to find something, anything in the STATIC.
46) 14) dialog: No.    We're not going anywhere.

The knife CLATTERS to the ground. The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, b there's no knife. Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that THUMBS ARE MISSING. Blood sprays from the stumps. Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her.

A MAN WITH WINGS. Jeep's eyes grow wide as the FIERCE ANGEL steps into the diner. But this looks like no angel we've seen before. This is a creature built for war. Rough hewn, battle scarred. His body armor making him appear disturbingly insect like. His wings are not feathery or gentle. Rather they are hard, mechanical, an organic machine. The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision. And now that we see the his face clearly, we notice his striking resemblance to Michael. We might even mistake th for brothers. His name is GABRIEL. Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical looking MACE in his powerful hands. And the world returns to NORMAL SPEED as Gabriel brings t mace arcing down at Jeep.
