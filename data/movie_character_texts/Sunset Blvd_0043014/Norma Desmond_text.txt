12) 164) dialog: Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.

12) 300) dialog: Don't hate me, Joe.  I did it because I need you.  I need you as I never needed you.  Look at me.  Look at my hands, look at my face, look under my eyes.  How can I go back to work if I'm wasting away under this torment? You don't know what I've been through these last weeks.  I got myself a revolver. You don't believe me, but I did, I did!

Norma lies on the floor looking after him.  She crawls toward a con- sole, pulls herself up by it, starts towards Gillis' door, passes a mirror, realizes how she looks, moves back to the mirror and takes the patches off her face and does a hasty job of removing the cream with her handkerchief, readjusts her expression to a poor travesty of a smile and goes to the door of Gillis' room.
13) 49) dialog: May I come in?  I've stopped cry- ing.  I'm all right again.  Joe, tell me you're not cross -- tell me everything is just as it was, Joe. She opens the door.

13) 65) dialog: You think I made that up about the gun... She rushes into her room.  Gillis closes the suitcase calmly, notices that he is still wearing some cuff- links Norma gave him, takes them off. Norma reappears in the door, carrying the revolver.
13) 66) dialog: See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!

He sees the situation, hurries towards Norma, who stands exultant in the strange light from the pool.

13) 120) dialog: They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once. Max flashes a look at the Head of Homicide.
13) 129) text: From the stairway comes a murnur.  They look up. Norma has emerged from the bedroom and comes to the head of the stairs.  There are golden spangles in her hair and in her hand she carries a golden scarf. The police clear a path for her to descend.  Press cameras flash at her every step. Max stands at the cameras.

I just want to tell you how happy I am to be back in the studio making a picture again. You don't know how much I've missed all of you.  And I promise you I'll never desert you again, because after "Salome" we'll make another picture, and another and another. You see, this is my life.  It always will be.  There's nothing else - just us and the cameras and those wonderful people out there in the dark...  All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my closeup. FADE OUT.
