4) 32) dialog: Hello, Mr.  Gillis.
4) 34) dialog: Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
4) 38) dialog: (to Artie)
4) 43) dialog: You forgot this.
4) 45) dialog: I've been hoping to run into you.
4) 47) dialog: I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
4) 49) dialog: There's one called....Window... something with a window.
4) 51) dialog: I didn't.
4) 53) dialog: Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ... There is too much racket for her.
4) 54) dialog: Is there someplace we can talk?
4) 57) dialog: This is shop talk. She and Gillis go through the open door into
4) 60) dialog: The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
4) 62) dialog: Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
4) 64) dialog: Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
4) 66) dialog: I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
4) 68) dialog: As for instance?
4) 70) dialog: We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
4) 72) dialog: Are you hungry?
4) 74) dialog: Phillip, you're mad! One of the girls who was on the phone comes to the door.
4) 78) dialog: No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
4) 82) dialog: You won't. (She takes the glass out of his hand)
4) 85) dialog: With a wildly beating heart.
4) 101) dialog: I just got the recipe: take two packages of cough drops, dissolve in one gallon of lukewarm grape juice -- Gillis looks up at her.  Without a word he pushes her aside so that she spills the drink.  He makes his way through the guests to the Vicuna coat, pulls it from the shelf, some books tumbling with it, and rushes towards the door and out.  Betty stands look- ing after him, completely bewildered.
8) 4) dialog: Is this Crestview 5-1733? ... I'm sorry to bother you again, but I've confirmed the number.  I must speak to Mr. Gillis. D-1b    MAX, AT THE PHONE
8) 6) dialog: Where can I reach him?  Maybe somebody else in the house could tell me. D-1d    MAX ON THE PHONE
11) 6) dialog: (Excitedly)
11) 11) dialog: Stop it, Artie, will you? (To Gillis)
11) 14) dialog: I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
11) 16) dialog: Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
11) 18) dialog: Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
11) 20) dialog: He thinks it could be made into something.
11) 22) dialog: Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
11) 24) dialog: This is on the level.  Sheldrake really went for it.
11) 26) dialog: Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
11) 28) dialog: I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
11) 30) dialog: Shut up, Artie. (To Gillis) Now if we could sit down for two weeks and get a story.
11) 32) dialog: I tell you this is half sold.
11) 40) dialog: It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
11) 42) dialog: You sure have.
12) 77) dialog: Well, for heaven's sake! She moves the book and the apple aside and points at the free space on the desk.
12) 78) dialog: Have a chair. Gillis sits on the desk.
12) 80) dialog: Why should you do that?
12) 82) dialog: You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
12) 84) dialog: See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
12) 86) dialog: This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
12) 88) dialog: Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ... From below comes the SOUND of the Isotta's horn.
12) 90) dialog: I'll make it short.
12) 92) dialog: I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
12) 94) dialog: Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
12) 96) dialog: We're engaged.
12) 98) dialog: I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
12) 100) dialog: Nobody can be that busy. There is another honk: from down below.
12) 102) dialog: You're tough, all right.
12) 104) dialog: Honest to goodness, I hate you.
12) 107) dialog: Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
12) 109) dialog: Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in. She reaches in a drawer for her notes on Dark Windows.
12) 111) text: So long. Betty picks up the apple and is about to throw it after him.
12) 112) dialog: Oh, you --
12) 176) text: (Lighted only by the last flicker of a fire on the       one.  That story of mine hearth).  Max is putting a fire screen in front of        Betty Schaerer had dug the fire.  He hears some steps and the creak or the     up kept going through main door being opened. He looks out and sees          my head like a dozen locomotives...
12) 185) dialog: I got the funniest letter from Artie.  It's rained every day since they got to Arizona.  They re-wrote the whole picture for rain and shot half of it.  Now the sun is out.  Nobody knows when they'll get back.
12) 188) dialog: What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
12) 190) dialog: It will?
12) 192) dialog: Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
12) 194) text: He resumes typing.  Betty puts the water on.  She picks up a pack of cigarettes on the desk, finds it's empty and throws it away, sees Gillis' open gold cigarette case and lighter on the table by the couch. Betty reaches for a cigarette.  The inscription en- graved inside the case catches her eye.  It reads:
12) 196) dialog: Who's Norma?
12) 198) dialog: I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
12) 200) dialog: I'll say.  This is solid gold.
12) 202) dialog: It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
12) 206) text: Gillis and Betty are walking  litte tour of the down it.  From a stage where  drowsing lot, not talk- they are erecting a new set   ing much, just wandering comes a great shaft of light. down alleys between the They stop at an apple-vending sound stages, or through machine in the foreground,buy the sets they were get- themselves a couple of apples ting ready for the next and walk on.                  day's shooting.  As a matter of fact, it was
12) 209) dialog: Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
12) 211) dialog: I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
12) 213) dialog: Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
12) 215) dialog: Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
12) 217) dialog: Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
12) 219) dialog: Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
12) 221) dialog: If you please.
12) 224) dialog: It must be my new shampoo.
12) 226) dialog: Twenty-two.
12) 252) dialog: Was I?  I'm sorry.
12) 254) dialog: Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
12) 256) dialog: I just don't.
12) 261) dialog: It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
12) 263) dialog: He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
12) 266) dialog: I don't want it now.
12) 268) dialog: Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
12) 270) dialog: You did.
12) 274) text: Gillis enters, closes        prison of mine that I the door as quietly as       started facing the facts. he can, and goes up          There it was -- Betty the stairs.                  Schaefer's future right in the palm of my hand.
12) 275) text: E-20    GILLIS' ROOM                 Betty Schaefer engag to Artie Green, as nice
12) 283) text: Betty, here's that weird-sounding woman again.
12) 284) dialog: What is this anyway? (Taking the phone)
12) 285) text: This is Betty Schaefer.
12) 289) dialog: Who are you? What do you want? What business is it of yours anyway?
12) 294) text: That's right, Betty, ask me again. This is Joe.
12) 296) dialog: Joe, where are you? What's this all about?
13) 3) dialog: No, I'll be all right. She shuts the door of the car and goes up the steps.
13) 12) dialog: (On the threshold)
13) 16) dialog: This is where you live?
13) 18) dialog: Whose house is it? They have reached
13) 21) dialog: Whose?
13) 23) dialog: That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
13) 25) dialog: Why did she call me?
13) 28) dialog: I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
13) 30) dialog: No.
13) 32) dialog: No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
13) 34) dialog: Come on, Joe.
13) 36) dialog: If you love me, Joe.
13) 38) dialog: Joe, I can't look at you any more.
