The walk in silence, Zelda nearly floating on whatever specia air she breaths and Becky, shorter and more anxious than Zelda has ever been. They enter Something She’s room. THE VENUE, BECKY’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 47 Becky moves her fingers like a conductor but she is summo all the women into a circle. She puts her hands down, motioning for everybody to take one another’s hands. Becky starts setting up. Her belief in mysticism is still powerful. She places small items, crystals, rocks, glass, the hands of all the women, puts ribbons on them and drap cloth over a stool in the center. She lights some smoking thing atop it. She has formed a prayer circle. Everybody eyes one another silently, going with it. It’s reminiscent of AA where people take hands. It shows Becky belief in powers and a program that has worked for her. Focus on Becky as she does finishing touches. It’s clear: is feeling weak right now and is putting this on to suppo herself in a time of crisis. The circle nears completion. Becky takes her place between Mari and Ali. 104.

Zelda turns a corner and sees Danny, Tiffany (with round pregnant belly), Ania with Tama, Lauren and Ali’s husband (scruffy fellow with a beard). Another roadie is showing to a private area to watch the show.
