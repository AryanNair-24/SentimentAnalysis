Becky Something is a rock goddess nearing the end of her reign at the top. You can see in her glassy half-gone eye that Becky is doped up. Becky ticks her head back and forth in rhythm to people chanting her name, closes her eyes, really digs it, throw a pair of middle fingers to the ladies flanking her.
0) 3) dialog: (under breath, quietly) I always flirt with death. On one side: MARIELLE HELL. Bass. (Mari, casually.) Mari super chill, dark, mysterious, smoking, half the mess tha Becky is and with none of the hang ups. The long term relationship with her girlfriend is proof that she can succeed as a fun time drug user rock star where Becky can The other side: ALI VAN DER WOLFF. Drums. Dependable, san sober. Ali keeps the rhythm and the band on track. She handles business while Mari and Becky are using. Ali is f devoid of her partners darkness and perpetually has that denied her by the sinking ship she is stuck on, with no l preserver.

Encore time at last. Becky steps into the spotlight, a ha forming around her from the bright hair. All three have fans blowing their hair, adding to the dramatic effect. Behind them is a banner with the band’s and logo: SOMETHING SHE. THE VENUE, THE STAGE — CONTINUOUS 2

I think I’m on another world with you With you I’m on another planet with you. Another girl, who’se loving you now? Another planet, is holding you down. Another planet. Here, on stage, you see the extent to which Becky fancies herself a god. Not a rock god(dess) but an actual, untouchable, invincible god. 4. Becky is way lost in her illusions but the band sounds gr She holds it together when get sloppy and she misses a no or word here or there. The song ends and Becky drops her guitar. Screeching feed wails as the crowd goes nuts and she stumbles, dizzy and headsick, off the stage banging into things and colliding with the wall and twirling. (Feedback continues....)

Ali instinctually hesitates, holds the baby away which ma Becky give her a confused, lost look but then it passes a Ali hands the baby to Becky, who deeply loves her. Becky holds Tama, kisses her, but Becky herself is such a slopp looking mess that as Ali steps back to watch it, there’s something painfully tragic and hopeless about this messed Madonna and child tableau that Ali wants to scream.

0) 33) dialog: That’s not true. That’s not true. I hadn’t worked it out. That’s not true. An imposing, strikingly handsome black man appears in the room. He is YA-EMA, Becky’s shaman/spiritual guru of indistinct beliefs. He is dressed in mystical ways: a big amulet around his neck, some sort of a curious hat.

If you see anything you identify as a pollutant to the energy of this space our mortal husks occupy let us KNOW so we can purge it while we have all the tools and the KNOW HOW to save us. Ya- Ema onward! C’mere Tama. They exit, Ya-Ema and Ali giving a distrusting look. Beck isn’t making sense, obviously, and the casualness with wh she carries Tama makes Ali and Kat really nervous.

Becky is way zonked and getting tired. The rush of finishing a show and the rush of drugs after finishing a winds down. Ya-Ema and Dymoke sit like statues, watching, quietly. Ya-Ema nods once. This is all you can get from him.

Like it probably won't work out or anything even though some of the ‘92 sessions we dug up are powerful and maybe a track or two from earlier that I’d forgotten. Becky pulls Ali down into her lap. Her energy is all over place and totally toxic to Danny and Ali. Ya-Ema and Dymo are in a trance, as if trying to control Becky’s mind. Enter HOWARD GOODMAN, the manager, (50).

Where is she Howard, and while we’re on the topic can you please tell me are we doing those recordings at R-Trax like last time because I can’t get a straight answer on the matter. Becky prances about triumphantly when saying this last pa The room is cramped: Ali, Mari, Lauren, Becky, Danny, Tam Howard. 20. All obstacles for Becky to shimmy around and out of the r Everybody follows her like the Pied Piper except Ya-Ema a Dymoke, who we leave behind for now.

We do rock music to rock people and didn’t I hear that on your last record didn’t even have any guitars??

Ali looks back at the door where Becky exited. Zelda is perceptive, deceptively so. Sly, eyes narrowing.

She's easy and boring and no fun isn’t that what you want? Mari has been hurting watching this. She and Ali look dow Becky with lumps in their throats. This pains them, a lot

She snatches Tama from a shocked Danny and then pushes hi park bench style, over a chair and he falls to the ground while she scurries off. This is all happening so fast. She exits. The room is empty of aggression. Just silent, shocked faces of people who want so badly to care about h Ya-Ema and Tiffany help Danny up. Seconds pass. It’s very few seconds but after what’s just happened, it feels like a lot. Time stands still, dissolv allude to the collapsing of real time and we see, in slow motion, the devastation wrought by Becky. Hurt feelings, smashed stuff. Seconds pass like hours in silence.

1) 0) text: Golden, yellowish brown lights buzz bask this past it’s p studio in a ancient haze of wood and history. The place i laden with signs of the amount of time Becky has spent he in the sprawling, open ended eight months of recording th have gone poorly. Tapestries hang over crystals and other items from Ya-Ema shitty candles, no fewer than twenty packed ash trays. Th place is capital D Dingy and Becky the decrepit centerpie Becky is wearing scarves and a threadbare t shirt with on sleeve nearly gone tucked into skin tight pants. She’d lo iconically cool if she wasn’t so tragic. Her messy ponyta is a caked with grease, a heart barrette in her hair, her skin is bad and she feels 1,000% like a goddess. She poorly makes feeble attempts to strum an acoustic gui and sing a weak sounding half finished song. Warbling, ba making notes and words find one another.

The whole scene is rocky as we pan to the side and see Ma and Ali. They are behind glass in the booth with Howard a the distanced hush shows off the tension.

You all can go home and take a nap or something now that your level of dedication is exposed. Right Howard? Did you come to check up on your prized project? Thank you for giving us space lately but I gotta tell you I’m sorry but things are going terribly, at best. Speechless reactions. Becky is super messed up, sweating, barely coherent, blind to it all. All four just stare at A quiet pause as we zero in on Becky: see and feel with q dignity the lack of understanding behind her bright blue eyes, the smoke screen of delusion which she hides behind Slow motion. Linger...there is nothing but truth and hone on her tired face. She believes every word she says and w we see Mari, Ali, Howard and Keith, the extent of pity an sadness for Becky transmits off them. It’s a small moment that becomes a big moment without announcing itself.

1) 37) dialog: It’s just as Ya-Ema prophesized! Ha ha, what a fitting moment just when I was seriously doubting your commitment. I mean it’s been a rotten year stuck carrying this mongoloid to term but today was the final straw and I knew it when I walked in the d-o-o- r. I felt the fetid stink in the elevator. Biggggg whoop.

The Akergirls blush at Becky’s kindness. Their idol! Beck touches all their hair and generally paws at them in a we grope-y way. Mari stands back, still and silent and loopy
1) 85) dialog: Cut the shit you’re making me feel a hundred years old but god damn I just feel a connection to you babes. Mari, you feel that? Mari is dead silent. Becky gives her a look, like: ‘are y in or out?’ And Mari knows it’s now or never.
1) 87) dialog: That’s what I’m talking about. Howard my Goodman. I’m ready to party and make a album and I have been sent angels to help me work the angels if you dig. What better way to introduce new blood into this turgid process than actual new blood. Becky bites Dottie on the neck, then bites Cassie.

1) 121) dialog: (half normal) Give me a minute? Mari exits. We stay with Becky. In silence, for a moment, just a fleeting instant of adult awareness, that Becky understands that this is it. There’s no chance after this Becky is still, starting to slip into a daze when her dou fades away and she lights up like a fire cracker, slams h Zippo closed and storms out into the room.

1) 132) dialog: Could I have made myself any clearer YES play. If we’re gonna be working together lets see what you've got. There’s tension. The Akergirls are afraid of being cast o and feel Becky’s judgement lurking. They strap on guitars bass), Cassie gets to the drums and they launch into a su sweet sounding melodic screechy early 90s Riot Grrrl insp song you could dance to, and indeed Becky does dance. Cas sings from behind the drums while Roxie and Dottie bring harmonies and backing on the chorus. It’s a fully collaborative song. (the song is called ‘Can't Wait’ and has been written by Anika Pyle.)
1) 135) dialog: SMOKIN’! I love it. Love love love. Becky kisses Dottie, Roxie and Cassie in the weird way th are now used to. She is super affectionate and keeps her hands all over them while throwing her body on theirs.
1) 137) dialog: This is what its about my sisters. Who wrote it?
1) 139) dialog: All of you? Brilliant. I’ve always longed for that connection but for some reason it never worked. I always did it all. By. Myself. 50. Akergirls look at Mari, who doesn’t disagree but it’s cle this credit hogging is a long time scab being picked at.
1) 140) dialog: Oh sure Mari, your contributions have been helpful. But I’m talking about a ground up collaboration. I wish I could give it to you now but I know myself too well. Highway or her way. (thumbs at herself)
1) 142) dialog: See, that’s what I need. Followers. Silent peons to worship at my feet. Mari is being beaten down silently. Becky is fully aware how much she is hurting her long time partner as she begi to prowl about the recording studio, moving like a spider preparing to launch into a messy soliloquy.
1) 143) dialog: Ladies ladies, what harmony you have found within one another! What spirit, shared, divided three ways. Alas. The rarest of things and not to be taken lightly. Capture it, my sisters, hold on to it and n-n-never release from the bond you share. Dottie and Roxie share a loving look. This all pains Mari Becky is showboating for the Akergirls and making her las ally feel terrible. During Becky’s speech, we are on Mari face as realization sets in.
1) 145) dialog: Um sorry but what?
1) 149) dialog: I support. It’s not a two-a-day two way street darling.
1) 151) dialog: Mari Mari Mari. Careful now. You’re gonna offend our guests.
1) 154) dialog: Now you've done it. Alienating the acolytes. Vanquish the venerating. Exile the exuberant. This is a blessed thing! The next. Hold them close, we should. Not expel them from our midst.
1) 156) dialog: Quiet, all! This is important.
1) 158) dialog: Run away! Flee flee. Big bad bossy Becky makes maudlin Mari mope. Get the bullshit outta here. It belongs, it belongs on fuckin’ Mars! (in the style of Heavy Metal Parking Lot) Mark pauses her exit. Turns to Dottie, Cassie and Roxie. 52.
1) 160) dialog: Now that’s the first logical thing I’ve heard all day! Mari exits with a final look back at Becky, who returns i not as Becky Something but as Rebecca Adamczyk.
1) 161) dialog: (to Akergirls) All I’ve ever asked is respect and if you can’t get that in the work place then where can ya get it? You dig, right? Becky jumps on Cassie’s back, piggy back style and starts whacking her with a drumstick like a pony.
1) 162) dialog: Mush mush! Onward! Into the future. The Akergirls, Dottie Cassie and Roxie. The latest greatest girl rockers found right here under a wing of the eternal Becky Something. The backing on the final Something She record and a smash debut album produced by none other than talent finder and nurturer Becky herself. Ah ha! On the wings of angels, a goddess and three witches. Something Rotten Crassie and 0.2Z.! Becky jumps down, knocking herself and Cassie and some ge to the floor. Dottie and Roxie help Cassie. You can tell them that in the past fifteen minutes, the luster has fad Becky has alienated those who the Akergirls believed to b true partners. The attitude on display fills them with dr
1) 164) dialog: Night time is the right time. Bed ways is right ways. Tally ho!
1) 166) dialog: Then let the wild rumpus begin! Becky grabs an electric guitar and poorly shreds: “Garbag Dump” by Charles Manson.
1) 167) dialog: Oh Garbage dump, oh garbage dump Why are you called a garbage dump? You could feed the world with my garbage dump You could feed the world with my garbage dump
1) 169) dialog: ERRRRR. Wrong. I am the heart and soul of the band. I mean hello I named it after myself. I found those girlies and they were not the first and they will not be the last. I put Something She together from the ashes of failed junk bands, wanting to put one out there in my own name like god spewing mankind. That's ancient history and so are those ungrateful wenches who suckled at the teet of success that I placed upon their mouths. All I ask, before the four of us embark on this journey, is that you show me honesty and I'll do the same. That is the pillar of my music so enough with this jibber jabber and let’s rock. (back to the Manson song) That sums it up one big lump. Becky is mile a minute, machine gun rat a tat fast. It’s reading billboards from a roller coaster. She keeps strum her guitar, not well but not terribly either. The Akergir look on, dazed.
1) 171) dialog: Well for starters go into that booth and wake those turds up and tell them that its blast off to the stars we go hit the fucking switch because the circus is leaving town and it ain’t comin’ back. There’s a silent pause where you can feel the Akergirls deciding if they should do this or turn tail and go home. Becky looks at them, aware of this indecision. She is sta sweaty, messed up, total maniac. Trying to catch her brea nearly ten years of her life torpedoed in the last half h It’s in her eyes: she looks beyond vulnerable and scared.
1) 173) dialog: (like the Kool Aid Man)
1) 180) dialog: You look like you die, then apologize But fuck it I didn’t mean to see this through. And I’m back to the same shit I was Drowning in mud If I’m gonna be pulled down Then I’m taking you with And I’m back to the same shit. I was drowning in mud If I’m gonna be pulled down Then I’m taking you with. Back on the Akergirls as this plays out.

She has an entourage in tow: Ya-Ema, looking dark and controlling and a documentary camera/boom mic crew of two Sad looking, down and out but they create some sense of heightened attention to what is otherwise not important. Becky wears an open leather jacket with just a pink bra underneath and the words ‘OLD SCRATCH’ scrawled on her to Her hair is huge, very 80s metal. Her makeup is theatrica Because of the video camera, Becky plays everything up to Nth degree in an effort to put on a good performance. It’ insufferable. She talks to the video camera, via to other people who are not listening. Rather than saying hello to mother, she is on lap three already.
2) 100) dialog: Ding dong the bitch is back. Who missed me show of hands? Howard pounces.
2) 102) dialog: Two. Minutes. To midniiiight! (Iron Maiden song) You're actually suing me, right? Or was that somebody else. I’1ll see you in court. Your honor. Is it a crime in this country to prefer the witching hour? I was born with an internal clock. The doctor left it inside me ha haaaa!! I call to the stand my mother, Mrs. Ania Adamczyk nee Smolinska. Mrs. Adamczyk, do you swear solemnly that your daughter was born with a rare neurological condition which renders the passage of time an enforced illusion of the external world?

2) 104) dialog: There’s people deserve a show and you have no idea the hell I’ve been through because I’m wishing there is any way on earth I could get going but just knowing I’m not going to make it. Promise me momma. When I die, have the coffin arrive half an hour late and written on the side in gold letters are the words ‘sorry for the delay.’ Ha HA! Oof. A terrible silence because, due to everything about Becky, the idea of her dying before her mother feels so r and perhaps inevitable. Everyone has been swept back away from the stage into the dressing room again. ROCK CLUB, BECKY’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 32 It’s jam packed. Insanity, people moving everywhere to av bumping into others. Ya-Ema has dropped to his knees and wraps Becky’s ankles and places crystals from a bag on ea of her legs and feet and is lighting little sticks by her feet in some odd purification ritual. It’s pretty nutso looking and Becky’s camera gets it all, including an increasingly despondent Danny and Ania.
2) 106) dialog: Mommmmmm, you're embarrassing me in front of my friends. I told you to wait in the car. They’re making a movie and I want them to see the real me so ix-nay on the ebecca-Ray.
2) 108) dialog: Fuckin’ stop it with the dramatics, mom! I haven't seen you in months and you lay this down? Danny and Becky study one another, a major look passing. Becky looks at Ania, whose hands now reveal an envelope f her pocket. 68.
2) 110) dialog: You get a pass. You did your time in the trenches but you were alone. Don’t you remember how alone you always were? You remember how you were always always alone.
2) 112) dialog: Great throw it in the trash! Where was he fifteen years ago when I was nobody but his daughter? Becky grabs the envelope and tosses it.
2) 114) dialog: How’s married life, Dirtbag? Give my best to Tiffany.
2) 116) dialog: Stay babes. Your loyalty will be rewarded. That’s how it works. Isn't that right, Ali? She pronounces it like Muhammad “Ali.” Ah-lee.
2) 118) dialog: Kid, your energy is so foul I could see you in the dark. Ania losing her composure. She came in here, brave and confident, but as usual, Becky is breaking her. She stand Danny silently asking for and receiving support from him.
2) 121) dialog: I was born ready. Doesn’t everybody know that by now? You think I need to warm up like some mere mortal? I don’t think so, Tim. Would I have stepped foot in this joint if I wasn’t ready for a double-V victory and if that means a great show two hours later than a crummy one people can thank me later alligator. (to Roxie/Cassie) Children, join me in the sacred circle of spiritual cleanse. Where’s the third member of your coven? (screaming) DOTTIE 0.Z. you your butt in here this instant you are guh-rounded!

2) 123) dialog: Girls, gather round. Join the circle of energy. Anybody who does not to be here you can leave or avert your gaze. (to video camera) Not you. Becky closes her eyes. Ali and the Akergirls do the same.

2) 127) dialog: As for me. Lady, if you’re listening still, I need this. I need this bad. This is it for ol’ Beckster. I’m gonna need your help here because the last train is leaving the station and if I’m not on it when the whistle blows, that’s it for me. Lights out. Last call. Soup’s cold. Ice cream’s melting. Beer’s warm. Yuck. Let’s rally, one more time, then you can take that soul I promised you. Danny shuffles, alarmed, when she says this. Becky stops prayer. Everybody is silent. The doubt of Howard and Ali about her not grasping the importance of tonight is gone. Maybe Becky was late because she actually wants to make t perfect. Maybe she is all clear headed and aware of herse finally. Becky looks right at the video camera.
2) 128) dialog: You get it? Perfect. Start with that it’ll be fucking phenomenal now let’s burn this fucker down for the big finish. She jumps and crystals fall and she lands with jazz hands when saying ‘big finish.’ The room is in shock.

2) 160) dialog: Demon, speak not to me. To hear your words is to open myself to your trickery. She puts her hand over Ali’s mouth and Ali continues to struggle to protect herself.
2) 162) dialog: I've fought you in eleven other lives and in eleven other lives you've destroyed me. I’ve seen the faces you’ve used and my demise at your hands across the centuries. Now at last I’ve looked across time and I see how to defeat those who will see me destroyed! Becky is scratching herself and Ali with the glass. Red m and pricks of blood are forming. Ali tries to yell for he but she is out of breath. It’s not loud enough and she ma direct eye contact with Ya-Ema who stands with folded han and will not move a finger to help and the camera crew, filming and not helping.
2) 163) dialog: For the first time I have the power to do what must be done and for the last time we struggle. (MORE )

Becky bites the security guard and is able to get free. S grabs the glass bottle again and points it at him. The gu lunges forward and she slices his arm. It’s bleeding and kicks her, pretty hard, to get her to drop the weapon and finally pins her against a wall and puts handcuffs on her Like a rabid dog, Becky barks and tries to bite people bu never stops looking happy, grinning, smiling because some it hasn't sunk in yet that this isn’t a game. She barks a snarls right at the video camera lens. Off to the side, Ali is regaining herself and cleaning wo and standing in the doorway, which we haven’t seen until are the Akergirls, watching Becky bite and snarl. The documentary crew is getting it all. Becky, fallen to floor, handcuffed, bleeding, looks up at her audience wit delight and joy. There’s a physical fight in her body bec the adrenaline is wearing off and it’s fighting the drugs she is starting to get wobbly.
2) 173) dialog: I confess. It was me! I robbed the savings and loan and I shot the sheriff and I fought the law and the law won. Now when do I get my lousy phone call? Speechless. Turn to Howard and Ali, still composing herse The Akergirls are truly shocked.

2) 185) dialog: D'ya ever get the feeling you’re being followed? Muted but loud cheers. Becky, clutching the mic and being grabbed at by security, launches into an epic rant that, matter how hard she is being chased, doesn’t stop. 78.
2) 186) dialog: I’ve been back through the ages of earth and I’ve witnessed centuries of conflict. I regressed to the moment of conception and watched myself being born. That's why I’m leaving now. When I needed it, nobody ever put a hand on my back and told me it was gonna be alright dude. It’s the little things. Security senses she isn’t a threat but is still holding h or at least blocking her from going anywhere and she’s stumbling, backed up against the speakers with nowhere to Faint response. People are alarmed. Becky is fading. She takes a guitar and tries to play but it’s impossible her hands cuffed and she spins the guitar, falls hard off stage into the equipment area and people rush to her, hud around and she’s clutching the guitar which broke her fal Feedback starts to wail. Becky isn’t laughing or talking. She looks up at people, eyes like a dying animal and she looks like someone wakin from amnesia and finally understanding where she is. A li girl, lost and afraid. She reacts with shaky fear. Feedback is still wailing and the video camera is in her and flash photos are going off and security is trying to her up but she’s like a protestor, heavy and inert. He lifts Becky, guitar and all. She’s dead weight as she carried through the venue to the exit, toward a police ca whose sirens we can already hear and whose red/blue flash lights get brighter the further he walks. The look on her face is fear and panic. Like she just woke up here and doesn’t know what is happening. Her energy dangerously al Feedback is still wailing, fading away from the stage. Be looks at the faces of the Akergirls as she passes. They a next to Howard and Becky is all bloody and weak.
2) 187) dialog: (quiet, pause before, a big sense of ceremony) Sometimes I don’t even own myself. Mom? With that, she stares, eyes wide open as if trying to pro a world, a realm of reality she doesn’t comprehend and is carried in the arms of security out the door into the waiting, wailing bright lights of oblivion. 38 79. People look around, back at the stage. They see The Akerg and Howard off to the side. There is still feedback which Dottie puts a stop to as Howard draws the club’s little curtain down, concealing them from view. END OF ACT THREE.

2) 190) dialog: I wanna stay home with my baby. No tour. No record. I like it here. Danny shows up, around the corner. He looks confused abou why a camera is there. Becky doesn’t look up at him.
2) 192) dialog: Take her. Take her. I’m so tired.
3) 0) text: Soft, breeze blown curtains. A big, empty, isolated, some dilapidated house with windows open. Glowing, soft light everywhere and this looks like a cartoon idea of heaven, contrasting with the red hell we just left behind of Act Becky is dwarfed by the huge space. Paint is chipped and peeling, floorboards warped and scuffed. She bought a fix upper and will never fix it up. This is going to be slow, static, locked off. (So even th this is half the page length of other acts, it’1ll be rou the same amount of time.) The camera never moves and seldom cuts. Becky’s life is immobile now. She’s in a thin, soft sweater over a tatter old Evergreen College shirt. Beyond natural. No makeup. S clean hair. The mask of theatricality is no more. Looking her, you'd almost think she’d been lobotomized. Becky Something doesn’t live here. Just Rebecca Adamczyk. The tea kettle boils and whistles in the kitchen. 39 40 80.

This is the most amazing performance of Heaven by Bryan Adams that you have ever heard or will ever hear. The emotion is unfathomable. Becky has never given anythi as much as she is giving this. 87. Tama loves it, bobs her head the whole time and when the ends and we finally cut to see Danny and Mari standing in door, he looks like he’s never seen anything like this an Mari just saw for the first time in a decade the Becky sh first knew and Mari, like every viewer watching this scen is crying right now.

3) 110) dialog: Slipping out I’ve caused you pain I shake at the thought of it Anyone could shift the blame But I’m the root the cause of it I don’t think I’ve learned Anything since you Taking ten steps back Polarize the view And how can I be expected to grow If I’m stuck living in what I Already know and I don’t wanna quit I just wanna be in control of it I don’t wanna quit I just wanna be in control of it What I recall Is cold and mean I owe good health and time to you But I get stuck To the wrong things And only space shows me the truth I have not learned I have learned nothing since you Taking ten steps back Polarize the truth It’s clear to Mari that this is exactly what they were tr to make in Act 2, a return to form that is also a leap forward.

We’ve neve seen her outdoors, ever. Tama runs off into the yard. Danny puts his hand on Becky’s shoulder as they watch Tam lovingly and he gives her a small look of acceptance and reassurance and that’s all she ever wanted. Becky steps away from it and into the light and walks off porch into the yard and follows Tama into a thicket of tr and lets the sun light and wind and all the rest wash ove her and her clothes are flowing and she looks like a ghos a movie whose spirit is finally let go and dissolves or evaporates into the air.

THE VENUE, CORRIDOR —- CONTINUOUS 46 She is losing her focus in the hallway which is full of c noises and the deja vu and the drugs are putting her on e She hasn't been around drugs since getting clean. There’s a circular disorienting moment where Becky gets l headed. She pauses and then resumes looking for Zelda. She opens Vivvy’s door again, confused.
6) 16) dialog: Oh, uh no. Sorry I didn’t realize this was...yeah sorry. She closes the door and walks off and just as she does Ze is coming towards her. Zelda looks incredible and is wearing some giant floor le gown/cape thing which is extreme and would look not absur exactly four people on earth and she is one of them.

7) 80) text: Mari and Ali walk towards Becky. We stay behind, watching three women from afar, the perspective of spectators. Still silent. Still calm. Slow. See people’s reactions ag This moment is about seeing Danny and Howard. Their faces unambiguously ambiguous. Each is certain of something els the worst. The best. Nobody knows for sure. From a distance we see the emotional huddle of Something Becky is shuffling. Mari is strong and confident as she p Becky’s head on her shoulder. Ali seems more reluctant to embrace. It’s not clear what is being said but it is clea what is happening: they trust one and love one another. Mari and Ali look Becky in the eyes and clearly she gives definitive answer. They pause. Her head is forcefully nodding, even though she seems wobbly and weak. Becky and Mari walk back to Howard and Danny.
7) 91) dialog: At the end I have to be me. I caused a lot of pain and I’m sorry. I was so nervous. I am so nervous. I don’t know how to go out there like that. All by myself.

Please give a Paragon welcome, together for the first time in nearly four years: Becky Something, Ali Van Der Wolff and Marielle Hell. Ladies and gentlemen: SOMETHING SHE! The crowd goes insane. It’s unreal to see these women together again. Howard gestures to the stage and Becky freezes like a deer in headlights. She looks out at him, the spotlights, the audience, hears applause and she can’t move. Mari and Ali are by her side

It’s really complete to see a rivalry buried publi Becky pulls the women in and huddles, muttering the plan. They take positions and the Akergirls get instruments and Zelda gets a tambourine or some noisy hand instrument and Becky and Mari and Ali exchange a warm and loving look an Ali gives a drumstick count and the song starts. It’s rousing, singalong ready. Everybody can take half a verse and sing together, beautifully, on the choruses. Tw minute long burst of pure punk and the song has a narrati about the ups and downs of being on tour in a band with nothing.
