44) 13) dialog: The doctor told you this is the first... are you listening? Of five injections you'll need over the next month. You will come here.
44) 15) dialog: Done. And that’s it. She goes through the hanging curtains, never having removed her mask. FERRIS, noticing his wedding ring, regretting that he had it on, reaches for his clothing.
45) 0) text: FERRIS, dressed, moves down a little hallway, and hearing running water, glances through a door and sees: AISHA, washing her hands. She has removed her mask. They look at each other. She gets it. He gets it.
45) 2) dialog: (in Arabic) You are welcome. FERRIS lingers. But if there was ever a time to blow a moment to talk to a woman, this is it. He limps on.

58) 11) dialog: Now you’re looking for something else. Something as different from her as you can find. Something impossible maybe. him with the needle. Drops it in the “sharps” bin. Pulls off her latex gloves and throws them away.
58) 12) dialog: We’re done.
58) 14) dialog: If you like.

58) 20) dialog: I don’t.
59) 0) text: Ferris is walking with Aisha down a narrow street that leads to a slum. A tinny radio somewhere plays Arabic music. Young angry men slouch in doorways, staring at them. Aisha seems to enjoy his unease. In Arabic --
59) 1) dialog: Was I right?
59) 3) dialog: I could have told you this is where I was going, if you’d asked.
60) 0) text: An outdoor clinic that makes Aisha’s other clinic look like Cedars. As she makes her rounds, attending to the sick, Ferris -- very much aware that everyone is aware of, and hates him -- waits, smokes. One of the young, unemployed men leaning against a wall covered with peeling posters of Arafat and anti-American graffiti, says in Arabic loud enough for Ferris to hear, “Who's the Jew?” Ferris ignores them as best he can, watches as an Arab man in a robe (HIJAZI, we will come to know later) talks with Aisha and gives her an envelope of cash...
61) 0) text: The CAFE OWNER comes out to where Ferris and Aisha are sitting, wiping his hands on a towel, humble, terrified.
61) 1) dialog: (in Arabic) Two teas, Mohammed. Thank you. The cafe owner nods but doesn’t leave. He seems unable to believe she has brought this man who could only be an American spy into his place, endangering him. Arabic: (CONTINUED)
61) 4) dialog: (meaning “go”) Thank you. The cafe owner leaves them. FERRIS opens a folding knife under the cheap tablecloth, lays it on his lap, and smiles with a little difficulty at Aisha.
61) 6) dialog: Do I? What else are you supposed to do at this point? Leave here alone? You're safer with me and you know it. Though there’s only so much I can do to protect you. Their hatred of you is intense. Everyone -- over their dominoes and cards and nargila smoke -- is staring at him.
61) 7) dialog: I don’t hate you. Unless I should. Should I?
61) 9) dialog: I’m asking what you do here. In Amman.
61) 11) dialog: That’s sufficiently vague. (a beat) I have a thing to tell you. An important one. A man is not his job. He wonders what she is trying to tell him. Her English fails her...
61) 12) dialog: He is... apart from his job. The man.
61) 16) dialog: I just want you to know... my feel -.. My understand... My understanding. Of you. They regard each other. The nervous cafe owner returns, his hands shaking as he sets the tea glasses down.
61) 17) dialog: We are friends. We may talk again. She sips her tea. And for Ferris it’s out of this world different from anything in his life to date.
62) 0) text: FERRIS escorts AISHA home -- or rather she, him. YOUNG ARAB MEN watch them from a dark storefront. Arabic music plays from an open window. This is a dangerous place, too.
62) 1) dialog: My apartment’s just around the corner. Thank you for walking me back. As they turn the corner, MARWAN and TWO OTHER GID MEN appear in front of them. The GID MEN are the same who were watching SKIP try to kidnap Karami. All in Arabic:

80) 0) text: AISHA readies Ferris’ third rabies injection.
80) 1) dialog: You’re uncharacteristically quiet.

80) 5) dialog: My sister looks after me in matters that are non-medical.
80) 7) dialog: I like to let her think so whenever I can. She jabs the needle in his stomach.

81) 3) dialog: You’re early. I’m still cooking. (hence, the apron; re: the box) What’s in there?
81) 5) dialog: Oh, the kids are going to love you.
82) 1) dialog: This is my sister, Cala.
82) 3) dialog: And Ali and Gamal... my nephews. He hides it well, but Aisha knows Ferris is relieved. He shakes the boys’ hands.
82) 4) dialog: Mr. Ferris brought you something for later.
83) 0) text: As Aisha and her sister cook, Ferris sits with the boys in the living room in an uncomfortable silence...

85) 1) dialog: Sorry about that.
85) 3) dialog: The funny thing is, she wants to live in America.
85) 5) dialog: Don’t joke about this.
85) 8) dialog: They're great, aren’t they? But not very good spies. (as his look to her is all innocence) At the dinner table. Where you barely touched a thing. None of you were good spies.
103) 0) text: Ferris and Aisha sit atop a jagged cliff overlooking the Dead Sea, 50-kilometers from the nearest tourist floating around on his back reading a newspaper. Here, it’s rugged, still, primeval.
103) 2) dialog: As often as I can. It’s as beautiful as a place can be where nothing lives.
103) 4) dialog: That's romantic. The word hangs there a moment. She smiles and stares back out at the ancient waters. In the distance, some Bedouins on camels ride silently along a ridge.
103) 10) dialog: What is this? It's small, sharp, and white.
103) 11) dialog: Is this... Ferris shakes his head he doesn’t know, but of course he does. It’s another piece of Bassam.
103) 12) dialog: It looks like bone.
103) 14) dialog: I don’t know. She rolls it gently between her fingertips, then holds it out for him to take. He holds out his hand and she drops it onto it. Ferris doesn’t know what to do with it. It seems wrong to throw it away, but he does. INT. FERRIS’ CAR —- MOVING - DAY (LATER) 161 They're driving on a highway, headed back to Amman presumably. Not talking. Until --
103) 15) dialog: What if I told you I don’t want anything to do with a man with a secret life.
103) 20) dialog: I’m not hiding anything. I wish I was. At least we’d be even.
103) 22) dialog: What are you talking about? Ferris doesn’t say.
103) 23) dialog: Are you talking about Hajazi? He’s a teacher. He donates money for medicine for people who can’t afford it. From his own pocket.
103) 25) dialog: You mean ‘okay’ no. You’re wrong.
103) 27) dialog: I can prove you’re wrong. Take me to Mu’‘tah.
103) 29) dialog: Nonsense. It’s perfectly safe. It's a university town. It’s where he teaches. You’1ll meet him. You’ll see. Ferris keeps driving. Doesn’t answer. Senses this may be the end of things here, and he’s right.
103) 30) dialog: Fine. Take me home.
103) 33) dialog: I’m not an outsider.
103) 35) dialog: I’1l be right back. She gets out, walks briskly down the alley. Ferris bashes his head back against the headrest. Looks around. Sees a HALF A DOZEN MEN playing soccer behind him, a unit of idling jihadists, no doubt about it. Ferris sinks down in the car, every fucker looking at him, and the soccer ball is driven deliberately into a side panel of the car, giving him a jolt. FERRIS thinks, what to do. And then gets abruptly out of the car. You don't want to be sitting down. He confronts the guys.
104) 11) dialog: You were going to kill that boy.
104) 13) dialog: And you know how to kill, don’t you. He doesn’t answer; there’s no point.
104) 14) dialog: I don’t know what you are... and you’re not going to tell me. There’s nowhere to go from there. 165 166 167 CHATTER 9/21/07 -- PINK 108. INT. FERRIS’ APARTMENT - NIGHT 165 Ferris looks very much like he did in the first scene. Tired. Sweating. Drinking.

HALLWAY OF AISHA’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 184 THE RINGING PHONE goes to Aisha’s voice mail. Ferris disconnects it and hits “redial” as he hurries down the hallway. The ringing phone again as he knocks, gets no answer, tries the knob. It turns. He enters -- INT. AISHA'S APARTMENT —- CONTINUOUS ACTION 185 It's been rifled, nothing destroyed, but everything askew, nothing where it was. BOOKS have been pulled off the shelves.

137) 0) text: Ferris stands some distance away from the camp clinic. Watches Aisha attending to patients. Helping people who need help. Something he’s never really done. He thinks about going over there to talk to her. Then doesn’t. Walks away.
