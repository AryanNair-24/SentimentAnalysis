13) 0) text: FERRIS and NIZAR sit looking at each other in the gloom. BASSAM leans against a wall of the thrashed room, holding Ferris’ HK. NIZAR is terrified, fingertips pressed together trembling, staring at FERRIS for help.
13) 2) dialog: Thanks God, thanks God.
13) 4) dialog: I know too many things. They prepared me to go outside Iraq.
13) 6) dialog: But then they said they needed me for martyrdom, here in Iraq. When a man knows too much they say ‘martyrdom.’
13) 11) dialog: (in good English) I don’t want to die. I want to go to America.
13) 13) dialog: God, God, God. Thanks God.
13) 15) dialog: I have a Ph.D. Me. And they want me to blow myself up!
13) 17) dialog: No! Linguistics! I speak five languages. Five. No one should say ‘martyr’ to me.
13) 19) dialog: I am!
13) 22) dialog: If I know enough to be martyred, with you I know enough to stay alive.
13) 26) dialog: Do you have a computer?
16) 2) dialog: No more questions here. Take me to the Green Zone. FERRIS says nothing... and Nizar’s hopeful smile fades.
16) 3) dialog: But they will kill me. Still nothing from FERRIS. NIZAR attacks him. FERRIS hurls him onto the dirt, then slams him into a wall as he rises. Nizar starts laughing and crying at once.
16) 4) dialog: You want to see who kills me. I talk to you and that’s all you want. I don’t want to die.
16) 6) dialog: Guantanamo? You threaten me with Guantanamo? (CONTINUED)

18) 0) text: Bad PREDATOR CAM pictures of this event: All either in shadows or chaos. They can barely tell what happened. TECHNICIANS pulling up less-than-useful images of the hit squad, the car they pile into, the car driving away. On another screen, a download of Nizar’s AL-SALEEM DVD replays. Translators (serious young men) watch, writing on pads, arguing about a word.
