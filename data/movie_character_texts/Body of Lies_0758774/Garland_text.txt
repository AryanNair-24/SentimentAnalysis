68) 4) dialog: Where’s Hoffman?
68) 8) dialog: He trusts you. (meaning, to send you here alone) I don’t trust him. Whenever you run an operation and don’t see Hoffman, it means he’s running another operation. The BlackBerry chimes softly. Garland glances at the incoming text message.
68) 9) dialog: I’m tracking a cell in Syria. They were in Damascus last night. Today, Dayr-az-Zor, on their way to the Iraqi border. But something tells me they aren't going to make it to Husbaya. We have ninjas waiting.

69) 10) dialog: A straw man. Receiving money. Making plans. lLet’s start with him. GARLAND plops onto an Aeron chair, clicks a remote. As the BIRD flies across a plasma screen, a Powerpoint presentation comes up. Garland clicks through earnest middle-aged male Arab faces...
69) 11) dialog: No... no... no... no... Maybe here’s your man. We see a passport photograph on the screen of a pious, somewhat bland zealot.
69) 12) dialog: His name is Omar Sadiki. He's Jordanian. An architect. Most of his commissions come from Islamic charitable groups who also send money to jihadists. He’s got every jihadist signifier... Except he’s innocent. FERRIS steps up to the screen. Regarding the callus on the middle of Sadiki’s forehead. (CONTINUED)
