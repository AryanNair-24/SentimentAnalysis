18) 0) text: Seven WOMEN sit around the cramped living room of this sm East Village apartment. At least one woman is nursing a child that looks entirely too old to still be nursing. This is the SINGLE MOTHERS BY CHOICE Support Group. CAROL 40's, short hair, tank top and no bra, is the leader.
18) 1) dialog: Everyone, please say hello to Zoe.
18) 3) dialog: Welcome to Single Mother's By Choice. As the name suggests, we are all single mothers by choice. Some of us have adopted, some conceived with a donor, every story is different, but with the same common denominator. We wanted to have a child, and we didn't need a partner to make it happen. The women smile and nod. They are a proud, no-nonsense, somewhat masculine bunch. LORI, pregnant with a buzz cut, turns to Zoe.
18) 8) dialog: Well, when we don't have partners with penises, we do what we've got to do, right? (then) So, tell us a little bit about yourself.
18) 11) dialog: Ah, yes.   The elusive "one."
18) 13) dialog: Society tells us we're supposed to find that special person to make us happy and complete. But guess what...you have to create your own happiness. You don't need someone to complete you, some...man. You already are complete.
18) 15) dialog: If you want to have a baby, we here at Single Mothers By Choice can be your partners. We will be your emotional rocks. Zoe looks around at her new "partners." There's SARA, the one nursing the toddler. And TABITHA, a tall women with a even taller afro and a nose ring. BRIDGET, a young girl covered in tatoos. And several more...
18) 16) dialog: From inception to college graduation and everything in between. We're here for each other. Sara smiles and nods at her nursing child.
40) 6) dialog: Zoe?
40) 8) dialog: Where have you been?    You haven't been coming to any--
40) 12) dialog: (eyeing Stan suspiciously) Hello. Are you two--
73) 17) dialog: Twins!   That's fantastic! Zoe bursts into tears.
73) 20) dialog: Are you okay? Is it a financial concern? There are many programs--
73) 22) dialog: Take your time. When you feel like sharing, we're here for you. We're all sisters here. (then, to the group) Let's give Zoe some space. When she's ready to talk, we're ready to listen. Deep, cleansing breaths, Zoe.
73) 24) dialog: Now, in the meantime, does anyone else have anything they want to discuss? Problems? Concerns? Tabitha, the tall woman with the nose ring, raises her ha
73) 27) dialog: I knew it!
73) 29) dialog: I knew you were with that guy!
74) 0) text: The women file out. No one dares look at Zoe. It's very awkward, although Zoe seems unaware. She turns to Carol.
74) 2) dialog: I'm going to have to ask you not to come back.
74) 4) dialog: I don't think we can help you, and, quite frankly, you're against everything we stand for.
74) 6) dialog: No.  Not you. (then) Do you know how long it took me to conceive? Five years. I had three miscarriages and spent every last dime on in-vitro. And Dana? The woman with the short hair?
74) 8) dialog: The one with the really short hair?
74) 11) dialog: She   just flew to Memphis to watch her   baby being born. Seconds after the   birth, the birth mother changed her   mind and refused to give it up. Zoe's face changes.     She starts to get it.
74) 12) dialog: So, as you can see, we are really dedicated and choosing to be single mothers, and you seem to be in a slightly different place. You're carrying two healthy babies, and you have no idea how lucky you are.
74) 14) dialog: I like you, Zoe. We all like you. But you kind of need to figure out where you are. Zoe nods.
79) 4) dialog: Hi, Zoe.
97) 0) text: There are candles everywhere and a table of food and drin Kind of like a birthing cocktail party. Zoe eats a browni Carol approaches with Lori, who is wearing a caftan and rubbing her large stomach. They all hug.
97) 1) dialog: Zoe, it's so nice of you to come, especially at this crazy hour.
97) 7) dialog: You have to stay. Lori wants us all to be together for this.
97) 9) dialog: (whispering) She's having a contraction. Zoe nods.   This is weird.   Lori breathes through it.
97) 14) dialog: The farmer?
97) 18) dialog: Listen, Zoe, if you're happy, we're happy. We'd love to meet him. Bring him to group any time.
99) 3) dialog: Come on everybody, it's time. She's getting into the water.
99) 5) dialog: Oh, it's a water birth.   Didn't Zoe tell you? Carol starts banging the drum again and moves off.
100) 1) dialog: Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.
100) 3) dialog: I know. It's amazing how the body can open up like that. Zoe covers her mouth. It looks like she is going to throw up. She stumbles for the door.
100) 7) dialog: You can't leave.   You're her focal point.
100) 10) dialog: She's in labor. You want to argue with her now?
101) 0) text: Carol beats the drum faster now. Some of the other Single Mothers by Choicers join her in the chant.
101) 1) dialog: Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya. Lori lets out a SCREAM as Tabitha and the MIDWIFE pull he legs back. Zoe watches with both hands over her mouth.
101) 3) dialog: Sssshh. It's perfectly natural. Sometimes the bowels just let go. (then, back to chanting) Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya. The midwife fishes out the poop with a plastic bag.   Zoe turns away, gagging. She drops her brownie.
101) 9) dialog: (excited) Here comes the head. Lori's moan turns into a DONKEY-LIKE BRAY.
101) 11) dialog: There's so much hair!
102) 1) dialog: Stan, get the mirror!
