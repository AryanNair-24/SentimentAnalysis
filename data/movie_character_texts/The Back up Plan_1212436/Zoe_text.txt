59) 4) dialog: Well, that's actually how I ended up with Nuts. I bought him from this pet store near my house. Six months later, I had thousands of dollars in vet bills and had to put him in a wheelchair.
59) 6) dialog: I thought about it, but what was that really going to do? They were still going to sell inbred dogs. So...I took the money I made when I left Google and just bought the place figuring I would do better.

66) 21) dialog: I know, this is so fucked up.
66) 23) dialog: The day we met. That same day. And I didn't tell you because I didn't think there was any way I could be pregnant.
66) 25) dialog: Because supposedly with frozen sperm it takes a few tries and...
66) 27) dialog: Because I wanted a baby. And I'm almost forty, and I never met the right guy. I was afraid if I waited any longer it would all pass me by, and I'd miss my chance. Stan just looks at her.       Speechless.

95) 8) dialog: I know.
95) 11) dialog: This period, as horrible as it was, made me who I am. I think every person should go through a hideously ugly phase. It builds character.

She's holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm around Nana.
95) 12) dialog: This   is one of my favorites because look   how happy I am. I don't even know   what place yellow is, but I'm sure   it's not good.

95) 17) dialog: Halloween. We were supposed to be a traffic light but Mona bagged out at the last minute and so Bobby and I just look like idiots. That's typical Mona, by the way.
95) 19) dialog: This is my mom. Stan takes the picture and studies it.
95) 21) dialog: This is the last picture of her that I have. She lived for a few more years, but we never took any pictures because she didn't want us to remember her like that. I was eight when she died.
95) 23) dialog: She had a great laugh. And really soft hands. She used to rub my back before I went to sleep. Zoe puts the picture on the bedside table, propping it up next to her clock.
95) 26) dialog: My mother was in a coma for two years before the end. That's when my dad left her.

95) 32) dialog: So, that's my story. That's the real me.
95) 34) dialog: Not for me they can't. Stan takes her hand, and they stay like that for a while. Just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room. Finally, the silence is broken by the telephone RINGING.
