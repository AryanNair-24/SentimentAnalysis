40) 0) text: under a bridge. A towering industrial landscape. PULL BACK TO REVEAL the other men: LEO ALDERMAN and MITCH KANOFF listen. Leo is a large blocky man. Mitch is even heavier. Leo is a kidder. He has good humor. Charm. He's a nice man. He'd kill you as soon as look at you. He wears a black cashmere top- coat over a plaid shirt. Among the cars in the b.g. is Leo's black BMW 733i.

You're putting down two, three scores a month. Month in, month out. And I see your stuff. You got great taste. A regular highline pro. I told Gags, 'I want to meet this guy!' He tell you that?

42) 17) dialog: You don't look, you don't case, you don't do nothing no more. We point you to a score, we tell you what's in there. When we tell you it's there, it's there. They are laid-out scores.
42) 19) dialog: Alarm system diagrams. Blueprints. Sometimes the front door key. Sometimes the scores are in on it, everybody's ripping off the insurance company.

68) 10) dialog: ... Yours if you want in. I'm gonna give you everything you need, kid. Don't tell me now. Let me know later.
68) 12) dialog: (alarmed) ... when you downed the stones...?!

68) 47) dialog: Done. You got a boy. See that? Frank throws an arm around Leo's neck and grabs his leg.
68) 49) dialog: Mitch! Get him off me! Leo's benign, paternalistic. Mitch laughs. Frank's gone to the phone.
119) 0) text: A hand ENTERS and reaches for one. In the multiple reflections we SEE Mitch. WIDEN. He fills it with water and drinks as FOOTSTEPS become Frank entering the knotty-pine basement. Leo in a floral bamboo tub chair with a hi-ball is waiting. Mitch joins him...

119) 21) dialog: I can't do that. It'd be embarrassing. Plus we got a major score in Palm Beach in six weeks we got to talk about. Frank looks over his shoulder as if someone was behind him.
119) 23) dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
119) 25) dialog: Houses, car. You are family. I'm taking care of you. What is this? Where is gratitude?

119) 29) dialog: Why don't you join a labor union?
119) 38) dialog: Yeah, yeah, yeah... (disgust) Get this guy out of here. Frank backs out. Leo watches Frank, calmly. cur TO:
126) 1) text: There are seven men in the room. Leo in a stained coat. Mitch, Attaglia, Carl, Larry and two 300 pound black men. Bumpers are on a motorized track of clips that take them through acid sprays and into electro-plating vats. Barely we SEE one bumper's not a bumper. It's a man. The figure's obscured by the assembly line. Attaglia's blase. He wipes a speck from the side of his nose. He'd love to lean all over Frank.
126) 2) dialog: (to Frank) Look. Frank looks. We REALIZE the form is Barry. Frank looks away. Leo grabs his face. Mitch helps. The two men wrestle Frank's face around.
126) 6) dialog: (continuing) I said fucking look at him! Look what happened to your friend. ‘Cause you gotta go against the way things go down. What's wrong with you?

126) 7) dialog: (continuing) But don't come on to me now with your jailhouse bullshit! Frank doesn't answer. Leo kicks him again.
126) 8) dialog: (continuing) ‘Cause you're not that guy! Don't you get it, you prick? You got a home. Cars! Businesses! Family! And I own the paper on your whole fucking life. (beat) I'll put your cunt wife onna street to be fucked inna ass by niggers and Puerto Ricans. Your kid's mine ‘cause I bought it. You got him on loan. He's leased. You're renting him. Frank: it sinks in. Leo watches it.
126) 9) dialog: (continuing) I'1l whack out your whole fucking family. I'11 grind ‘em into hamburger. People'll be eating ‘em for lunch tomorrow in their Wimpy burgers and not know it! Frank doesn't talk. (CONTINUED)
126) 12) dialog: (continuing) You get paid when I say. You do what I say. I run you. There is no dis- cussion. You go nowhere. I want, you will work till you are burned out, busted or dead. You get it? You got res- ponsibilities. Tighten up and do it. Frank doesn't say one word.
126) 13) dialog: (continuing; looking at Frank, but to two black heavies) Clean this mess up. One flips a switch. A heavy electric MOTOR WHINES to life. The line of bumpers and Barry jerks in slow progress towards the acid baths. Leo takes off the work coat. Frank has moved not at all. He said nothing.
126) 14) dialog: (continuing; to Frank) Get him outta here. Back to work, Frank. Barry is about to be processed through the acid baths. Anything is possible. Leo leaves. Barry disappears into the machinery... cur TO:
142) 0) text: Leo's 50-year-old zombie wife in her housecoat and run- down slippers, watches t.v. on the formica and chrome kitchen table and turns as Frank enters, the .45 coming. She reacts to it, not at all. She turns back to the t.v.
142) 1) dialog: (from living room, annoyed) Vince? Christ! What did you break?

149) 3) text: Leo FIRES a wild SHOT. Frank FIRES TWICE blowing Leo against the lamp which doesn't break. Leo raises the Magnum again. Frank's third SHOT kills him. Leo's position is bent and grotesque; the fallen lamp is lurid.
