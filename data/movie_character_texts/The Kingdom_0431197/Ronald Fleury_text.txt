Little Kevin has a large cardboard square with pictures f different stages of his life taped to it. He's telling th class about the photos. We're TIGHT ON the pictures. TIGHT ON the young faces. TI ON Fleury.
2) 4) dialog: I sure can. That was December 4th and that was the day that we spent the whole day in the hospital waiting for this guy right here to come out of Kevin's mom's tummy. And we waited and waited but he wouldn't come and we kept waiting and finally the doctor said `OK...he's not gonna come out on his own so we got to go get him.' And well, Fleury stops, checks in with Miss Ross.
2) 5) dialog: Can I tell this story?
2) 8) text: Then what happened? RONALD Fleury
2) 10) text: What did they do? RONALD FLEURY

21) 34) dialog: (to Lyla)
28) 4) dialog: Numbers so far: 100+ dead, 200+ injured. The target was a softball game. Rumor is the Killers wore Saudi police uniforms. (beat)
28) 7) text: So was Rex Burr from State. Fleury lets the news absorb as he steps back to the podiu No one says a thing. Fleury lifts his eyes again, real trouble maintaining control... RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
28) 9) text: From the craters, looks like they used a High Explosive... possibly military grade: can't fit that much TNT into a vest. 20, 30 pounds of PETN: they got it. Semtex or C-4: they could get it. The third there, God knows...that crater looks like a plane dropped a 500-pounder... RONALD FLEURY

28) 23) text: Yup. RONALD FLEURY
28) 34) dialog: From the State Department, one hour ago: `We are in agreement with the Saudi security assessment that any additional American presence on Kingdom soil represents reckless risk. Therefore it is the Secretary of State's position that only after the situation has been evaluated and contained, should the Federal Bureau of Investigation activate Rapid Deployment.'

34) 25) text: Pardon me? RONALD FLEURY
34) 27) text: It's some variation on vengeance... When one of your own is killed, Agents lose their analytical powers - kind of a greatest strength, greatest weakness thing... RONALD FLEURY
34) 28) text: If I wanted vengeance, I'd have whispered `Rex Burr' into Ellis's ear right when we walked in. (beat) Eyes migrate to Fleury -- RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)
34) 33) text: (beat, fuck it: Go) Al Qaeda lost the first phase of this war, so a new, zero-sum phase has begun: if you won't join us, we'll let loose the truly talented Murderers... Abu Hamza. He will kill so many of you that the resulting humiliation of the Saudi Royal Family will cause an exodus, a rebellion, both. Because the Royal Family simply cannot protect you or yours any longer. Fleury studies Janet with solid respect. He gives Janet a subtle nod: "Nice work." RONALD FLEURY

34) 39) dialog: To not engage these criminals out of fear for our personal safety is just another way of saying `uncle.' Fleury takes another deep breath.
34) 40) dialog: I'll say it another way: Evidence starts to go cold after twenty four hours. If we can't get in now, we will not find the man or men responsible for this crime. We couldn't do it at Khobar; we couldn't do it in Yemen; we have barely scratched the surface in Iraq. And we are on verge of not doing it here. They are getting stronger, we are getting weaker. I just lost a very good friend and I would very much like to go and do my job. Beat.

36) 36) dialog: I'm just trying to do my job, Elaine. That's it. Call Thamer.
37) 1) dialog: Get back in.
38) 1) dialog: Too many people we both know were at the bar. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Highness.
38) 3) dialog: She can be a bit of an exaggerator... I'm sure things were somewhat over-stated. I see myself as friend of Saudi Arabia. I just need a little cooperation, that's all.
38) 5) dialog: Full cooperation: my Team cleared to land at Prince Sultan Air Base. Tomorrow. We want to help in a very muscular way, quickly.
38) 7) dialog: This goes one of two ways. First: The FBI with the White House go on the kind of aggressive PR "Saudi Royal Family Decaying Monarchy" bender that just can't help but hurt. Really hurt. And I don't care how many Chinese are lined up to buy the oil. You know it's gonna hurt.
38) 11) text: You have no proof of this. RONALD FLEURY
38) 12) text: We're getting there, Sir. And I haven't even brought up the two girls still missing out of Houston. This is big. It is real.

38) 14) text: What is your point? Fleury looks back to him. RONALD FLEURY
38) 18) dialog: Right now immediately. Fleury looks back at the Ambassador. A stare down.
39) 3) dialog: -4. With a 25-man security detail-
39) 5) dialog: That's too bad.
39) 7) dialog: Men in Saudi Police uniforms are why we're talking now.

53) 2) dialog: Special Agent Ronald Fleury.
54) 5) dialog: If somebody was tailing us it'd be obvious. This is just standard operating speed. Al-Ghazi on the edge of his seat, no belt, scanning for threats: sidewalks, traffic, rooftops.
54) 9) text: I have been there only once. I spent four days at Quantico... I saw your Michael Jordan play for the Washington Wizards. Small laughs. RONALD FLEURY

54) 31) dialog: You don't know the source of the blast, don't know if your own Officers were involved, but you won't let us work nights? Al-Ghazi stanches an explosion. Haytham looks over at his Colonel: rarely ever seen him like this. Looks in the rea view mirror to see Sykes, the man giving the Colonel fits Sykes catches him looking back, gives him a quick wink in the mirror. TIGHT ON Haytham's face: the guilty little sm you give when someone takes your boss to task.

64) 19) text: You will be permitted to walk through the crime scenes. When we have determined that it is safe. A stand off. Fleury eyes Al-Ghazi. Trying to figure this out. Sees something that looks like a flash of embarrassment i Ghazi's eyes: unable to perform his profession, relegated Tour Guide. Leavitt begins taking notes. Haytham sees his notebook, snaps his fingers at Al-Ghazi who looks, nods: him. RONALD FLEURY

Pin-drop silence in response to Fleury murdering the Prin "lite subjects," his attempt to extend the gilded circle- by offering tours. Bin Khaled's face sinks to gray again after the excited pink of talking about his Falcons. His slowly moves back over his stomach: Napoleon's ulcers. As Fleury speaks, people unconsciously put their tea-cups do look up at him with wide-eyes. RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)

86) 1) dialog: Have him pass these out to the compound security. See if anybody knows them. Fleury, Leavitt, and Al-Ghazi walk past the Land Cruiser Haytham took out. 15 Police INVESTIGATORS on-scene: Leavi stops, drops his bag. Al-Ghazi introduces him to the Offi in-charge. Leavitt opens his evidence kit. A couple of Police can't but sneak a peek, checking out what the American's got inside.

102) 5) dialog: This place is community service?
102) 7) dialog: Why did he turn himself in? Before Al-Ghazi can answer, Talal begins talking to him i Arabic. Al-Ghazi translates:

Al- Ghazi nods, swings his head to thesnarled/wrecked highway traffic. PEOPLE hesitantly step toward uniforms they trus instinct. Haytham dumps the pile of weapons at the Team's feet, re-loads his 9MM. Janet ties a half-assed tournique around Sykes' reminder of an arm. Al-Ghazi steps toward the approaching crowd: they see his state, his gun, and turn back: panic starts to infect the larger mass, then the topper- -AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE from somewhere. Glass-dirt-metal burst around us: this attack is still going. Fleury looks up: just the roof of an old Mercedes on the median, dirt kicked up behind them, running behind lines stopped-wrecked traffic now. The barrel of a rifle held h out the window like a taunt. Accelerating for another ope to finish the job. Scared motorists devolve into terrified motorists. Many h abandoned their vehicles to sprint into the desert, the r go smash-'em-up derby-folly: 50 panicked drivers aiming f the same spots. Fleury snatches an M4A1 from the stack dropped by Haytham, up to his shoulder, hustling toward t next break in traffic. The Mercedes is approaching at 80 RONALD FLEURY

Half young boy, the other hal something much more dangerous...Expert movements from his hands, racking back the slide, thumbing the still smoking shell from the ejector, letting the slide go, racking ano round into the chamber. Then... Fleury finally pulls his trigger. Utter Distortion as the old man reaches for the teenager' fallen hand gun. Janet, screaming, raises her gun towards old man as Al-Ghazi shoots the old man in the chest. Sobb the little boy runs to his fallen grandfather. Janet, sti screaming, covers the family. The Grandfather whispers something we cannot hear in the Little Boy's ear. TIGHT ON HAYTHAM taking it all in: the bleeding, dying teenager; his hysterical sister; Hamza choking, clutching his grandson. CHAOS, CONFUSION, CONFLICT swirling in Haytham's eyes. A platoon of SAUDI POLICE slowly enter the room. Janet goes to the shot 15 year old, starts trying to stop bleeding... Fleury reaching for the dying Al-Ghazi, cradling him. Tea spill as his eyes move from the dying boy to the old man, back down to Al-Ghazi. Fleury grasps Al-Ghazi's hand, as a Saudi man would.
