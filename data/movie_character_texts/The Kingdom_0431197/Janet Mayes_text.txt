57) 4) dialog: That is what they say. Doesn't add to crime scenes. Television cameras shrink them. Misrepresent. No smells. Poor sound. Limited view. TV always makes them look smaller. You can't feel the hatred on television. TIGHT ON FLEURY: Quiet and focused, taking everything in.

The Prince gives a litt curtsy, no words, steps back to Fleury: the pictures re- start. Bin Khaled holds Fleury's hand sixth-grade boyfrie style. PRINCE BIN KHALED

73) 1) dialog: This is the kind of radical circumstance that could have seriously upped Shaq's free throw percentages. Take a man. Ship him off to Riyadh. No phones, constant threat of death, no girls, no hip hop. Nothing... just free throws. Shaq, he'd be shooting at least seventy percent. Lakers would still be together. Kobe and Shaq lovers forever. Leavitt calls to Fleury.
76) 7) text: -report me then when you get in- touch with the General- -Officer reaches down from nowhere and hammers Al-Ghazi o handed as Al-Ghazi tries to step past. Collective shock. In that breath, Haytham punishes the Officer with a left- cross: knees buckle before he comprehends what hit him. Haytham's kick follows, catches the Officer in the sternu he hits ground. Al-Ghazi shakes it out, trades blows with the SANG second command. Leavitt moves, catches a rifle butt to the shoulder after steps.
