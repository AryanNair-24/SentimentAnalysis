The kind American that only grows in tiny southern hamlets. Milita whitewalls, short-sleeves, khaki Dockers, a thick Casio G shock, FBI credentials visible on a chain. Hangs up his phone. Lifts his eyes: Hell from one side of frame to the other. Saudi teams setting up portable light that bathe the horror in industrial incandescent. Columns black smoke. Fleets of emergency vehicles. 100 uniformed Another 200 in bio-suits combing the ball field, the park lot. Fran has to do something/anything. Move through the horror with him now. His hands shake, hi face already dirty with soot. Jumps in with a Saudi team pulling a half-burned WOMAN out of a smoldering Range Rov She fights them, gouging Fran's face, trying to get back She is the woman we met at the gate of the compound.    S wants her baby.

Five times the size of the suicide bombs. Shreds emergency vehicles, nearby homes and apartm buildings. Kills Saudi rescuers by the bushel. Fran is crushed by a flying portable light standard. Rex is blown into the man handing out coffee. The walking wounded get decimated.
