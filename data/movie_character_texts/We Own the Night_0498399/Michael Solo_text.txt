11) 3) dialog: In a house of God, no less? C'mon, get up...
11) 6) dialog: Hello, Bobby. Nice suit you got on.
11) 89) text: Michael Solo pipes up from the back:
11) 91) dialog: Bobby, it's important. These ain't dumb guys we're talking about. We don't stop `em up front, coupla years from now, it'll be chaos out there.
17) 4) dialog: The spot's got one main entrance, two rear fire exits. All of `em'll be covered.
17) 13) dialog: What if he is?    We still go?
17) 16) dialog: What's it gonna be?
27) 39) dialog: You got anything in there?
27) 66) text: Just then, MICHAEL SOLO interjects.   In Joseph's ear:
27) 68) dialog: Coupla dimes on `em--cocaine, a little PCP.
32) 45) dialog: I don't know, Joe--forgive me, but uh, your brother... Ever since your mother got sick--
39) 49) dialog: Bobby, it's Michael Solo--I got some bad news.
39) 63) dialog: Listen, your father's coming--I gotta go. But he's at St. John's.
42) 3) dialog: The shot went in his cheek and come out through the jaw. It missed his brain, thank God.
42) 6) dialog: He was real lucky--considering.
42) 11) dialog: Bobby--that ain't a good idea.
42) 17) dialog: Listen, I ain't judging you--I called you `cause I thought you had a right to know. But we're gonna be going hard after Nezhinski--and maybe some other people you're close to. Like that girl you know--
50) 23) dialog: Jesus Christ, you gotta be kidding me!
51) 3) dialog: Nezhinski got a hit list? On us?!?
51) 10) dialog: We gotta go bust `em, Burt--right now.
51) 15) dialog: That could take us forever!
51) 35) dialog: What about callin' in the Feds? They got a lot more juice than we DO--
51) 42) dialog: How you know about that, Bobby?
51) 47) dialog: Well, maybe that's it, then. If we can get him-- (re: Bobby) To set something up, maybe one of our uncles could move in--
51) 66) dialog: You'd go set up a buy with `em, just like they've been asking you to. We follow you to the spot, bust `em a week later. That way, your name's clean, nobody knows you're involved--
54) 5) dialog: Yeah. Your father's still with him- -we were just gonna go back to the PSA. Try and figure out a tac plan on Nezhinski.

55) 33) dialog: Now listen: from now on, you'll get all your information through this, at an undisclosed location. Your contact with us is over after you leave here.
55) 36) dialog: Just be smart about things. Okay? You get burnt and we gotta put you in protection, it's still better than winding up dead. An informant dies, they talk about you for a day. A week later, ain't no one remembers your name.
55) 47) dialog: She won't be a target. Just make sure she don't open her mouth.

114) 23) dialog: Bobby, come on--you got your own life to live--
114) 29) dialog: Then you gotta understand--this ain't something you do just for a vendetta. You gotta go back to the Academy when you're done, you gotta commit yourself.
114) 34) dialog: Gimme a couple days--I'll talk to the P.C.
117) 3) dialog: ...But we got our guys   out there, working the street all   over? I mean, they coupeing or   they working?
