8) 6) dialog: You remember what I tol' you?
8) 10) dialog: Nobody knows about my father and my brother--not even Jumbo. And it's gotta stay that way, you understand?
9) 11) dialog: Nah.   Nah, I'm managing now.
9) 15) dialog: Yeah. I'll see you `round, arright?
9) 20) dialog: (slightly sheepish) I changed my name--I use my mother's name now. It's better for business. C'mon...
10) 25) dialog: That's them there. In the corner. Lookit `em--two peas in a pod.
10) 29) dialog: [My] Father's friends--they were all in Korea together. (with a laugh) Biggest bunch of fuckin' stiffs... (moves closer) Look, don't talk to nobody, we'll get out quicker.
10) 33) dialog: N--I just wanna get out quick, that's all...
10) 41) dialog: Yeah I did so...congratulations...
10) 52) dialog: Pop. (Rosario moves near) Everybody, this is my girlfriend. Rosario.
10) 56) dialog: This's my brother. And my father.
11) 17) dialog: I know. I like it this way. (no response, so:) That why you got me up here?    [To] tell me my hair's too long?
11) 22) dialog: Whatsamatter?
11) 27) dialog: (lights a cigarette) That's a good hook for you.
11) 32) dialog: You ever talk?
11) 38) dialog: 
11) 45) dialog: You cut me off financially, and now you need the favor? `S interesting.
11) 55) dialog: `S good lookin' boy!
11) 61) dialog: I don't know nothing about that.
11) 65) dialog: The old man?! What, you been watching us?!?
11) 69) dialog: (back to Burt) What the fuck is this?
11) 82) dialog: You kidding me? Inform for you?!? That's what you wanted me here for?
11) 86) dialog: Yeah well, find another way. I got a lot invested in that club and I can't let it get fucked up.
11) 95) dialog: [You] Fuckin' broadsided me... Everything's about the goddamned job with you.
11) 105) dialog: C'mon... Get off your fuckin' high horse and bust somebody else's balls.
11) 112) dialog: You're welcome.
11) 116) dialog: 'S that supposed to mean?!?
11) 121) dialog: Congratulations. You got me up here.
11) 125) dialog: Good.   Then now you know.
11) 130) dialog: Yeah.   I like the dark meat.
11) 140) dialog: (lets out a chuckle) Why, you want some?
11) 144) dialog: I gotta go, Pop. I'll see you `round.
12) 9) dialog: C'mon, let's get outta here, [we'll] go party with Jumbo.
12) 14) dialog: (waves her off) We're goin'. C'mon.
15) 8) dialog: You're just like her, baby...
15) 19) dialog: That's cool.
15) 23) dialog: It's all right--they don't like nobody outside their own little world.
15) 27) dialog: My brother and my father ain't like that. It's just--the whole thing ain't for me, that's all.
15) 31) dialog: You know how gorgeous you are?
15) 44) dialog: What is it?
15) 49) dialog: ...it's beautiful...
15) 52) dialog: ...you're so good to me...
15) 56) dialog: Only if you behave yourself...
16) 3) dialog: Uh oh--[The] party's really gonna get started now!
16) 25) dialog: Any Spanish Fly in there for you?
16) 32) dialog: I'm goin' up to see Buzhayev tonight. I think he's gonna ask me to buy into the club.
16) 43) dialog: I'll show you a fuckin' faggot!
16) 46) dialog: Everybody, I gotta be at El Caribe in an hour, so get ready!
20) 5) dialog: No no, I'm all right... Hi everybody...
21) 3) dialog: Everything's really rockin' tonight. Line's halfway `round the block.
21) 8) dialog: You wanted to talk to me?
21) 20) dialog: 'S a good move.
21) 24) dialog: I appreciate that. You know, I been thinking `bout it--I'd like to become a partner here too--buy in with you.
21) 30) dialog: Well, I just think we could do more. Maybe expand into Sheepshead Bay. I know a good spot--we add a restaurant there, get the spill- over. Like what your brother did, in Miami.
21) 38) dialog: I can understand that. But I got money to invest--we could make it something real special over there. Do what I did downstairs--you know, bring in name DJs on different nights?
21) 50) dialog: Yeah, sure.   I'll come.
21) 58) dialog: Nah nah, no thank you...
22) 5) dialog: Listen--I get this done, I want you to be a host. In one of our spots.
22) 9) dialog: Well, just make sure you get your old co-workers from the Health Department to give us a pass on the kitchen.
22) 21) dialog: Where's Rosario?
22) 27) dialog: Goddamnit... [She's] With that fuckin' animal again.
22) 31) dialog: Look at him... I'll tell you, [when] this is my place, we'll kick his fuckin' ass right outta here--
22) 36) dialog: Yeah, you know a lot.
24) 6) dialog: You sure it wasn't your dick?
24) 12) dialog: Shit... I'll be right back.
24) 33) dialog: (nods; then, coolly:) Things're goin' good.
24) 40) dialog: He don't look like a middleweight no more.
24) 51) dialog: Your uncle's a great man. Smart man.
24) 58) dialog: Your uncle loses his license, he ain't gonna be too happy.
24) 65) dialog: Yeah...I'll think about that. Rosario--I wanna talk to you.
24) 80) dialog: You gotta stop dealing. You hear what I'm telling you?
24) 83) dialog: You hear what I said?
24) 88) dialog: Just hold off then, for a little while. Okay? I got my reasons.
27) 3) dialog: Gimme your shit!
29) 12) dialog: Thanks a lot.    I appreciate it.
29) 20) dialog: Okay, I'll go thank him too then. He comes in, raids the fuckin' place--now I gotta go beg `em not to fire me--
29) 24) dialog: Fuck you, Pop.    Fuck the both of you's.
29) 29) dialog: You fuckin' touch me!? You gonna fuckin' touch me?!?
31) 9) dialog: Mr. Buzhayev... I'm real sorry about what happened the other night.
31) 27) dialog: You don't mind my saying, I think that's probably the right thing to do.
31) 32) dialog: Mr. Buzhayev, my getting arrested ain't gonna be a problem. I don't got a record--
31) 40) dialog: Yeah...   All right...
32) 10) dialog: You had to hit that spot.
32) 15) dialog: I had plans down there.
32) 19) dialog: You got real balls saying that to me. I made something for myself, and you come in and fuck it up? Just `cause I'm not trying to be like you? And Pop--
32) 29) dialog: What did you call her?
32) 34) dialog: You piece of shit...
32) 42) dialog: Fine with me, you motherfucker!
39) 6) dialog: That ain't nothing.
39) 16) dialog: We'll see you and bump you two C's.
39) 31) dialog: Siegfried and Roy, baby! Two fucking queens!
39) 41) dialog: Who is it?
39) 47) dialog: Hello?
39) 61) dialog: Is--is he gonna be all right?
39) 68) dialog: My brother was shot...they're operating on him now.
39) 74) dialog: Game's over, everybody.
39) 78) dialog: That's right.    I gotta go.
39) 85) dialog: What're you doing?
39) 95) dialog: No--it's gonna be a fuckin' scene. I'll call you later.
39) 99) dialog: Don't argue.
39) 102) dialog: Louis, lock up and take her home.
39) 107) dialog: Yeah, no--I just remembered I gotta do something, that's all--
41) 10) dialog: Pop?
41) 13) dialog: Pop, he all right?
42) 8) dialog: (almost to himself) I need to see him...
42) 15) dialog: You guys blaming me for this? Is that it?
42) 19) dialog: That's bullshit--she's clean.      You fuckin' keep away from her.
43) 5) dialog: Yeah.   That's me.
43) 14) dialog: Look--I'm his brother, you fuckin' hard-on!
46) 3) dialog: ...Feels like it was my fault...
47) 15) dialog: Hercules, do me a favor--before you kill a waitress, go pay the check.
47) 20) dialog: Don't tell Louis nothing about what happened. Far as he knows, my family moved away, [a] long time ago.
47) 32) dialog: I didn't have nothing on me.
47) 37) dialog: Your uncle's got some problems now, though.
47) 47) dialog: (to Rosario) Baby--why don't you go keep Jumbo company, make sure he leaves a tip.
47) 58) dialog: It's a little dangerous right now, don't you think?
47) 63) dialog: Muscle--?
47) 67) dialog: A cop got hit today. They ain't never gonna sit still for that.
47) 90) dialog: (nods; then) I'll see you around...
49) 12) dialog: I need to find Deputy Chief Grusinsky.
50) 3) dialog: Pop, I gotta talk to you.
50) 7) dialog: It's important--I got information.
50) 10) dialog: It's about you.
50) 13) dialog: It's bad.
51) 7) dialog: Yeah...
51) 40) dialog: Pop, Nezhinski's been talkin' about a shipment he's got comin'. Maybe that's how you get to him.
51) 44) dialog: (somewhat sheepish) They been wanting me to buy in for a while.
51) 62) dialog: What do you mean, set something up?
51) 71) dialog: Pop?
51) 75) dialog: You could trust her.
51) 79) dialog: But...but you could get killed--
52) 11) dialog: Your mother's real important to you, ain't she. You'd do anything for her.
52) 20) dialog: Go back to sleep...
54) 3) dialog: You been up to see my brother...?
54) 7) dialog: ...How's that been goin'...?
54) 13) dialog: Well I... I been thinking...if you could keep it confidential...?
54) 18) dialog: They trust me--we could go in large, use my money for the buy, they won't suspect anything--
54) 30) dialog: 
54) 35) dialog: I know.
54) 40) dialog: So please--can we do this...?
55) 5) dialog: Hey.  It's Bobby Green.
55) 16) dialog: Fifty k, to start.
55) 21) dialog: Sounds good.
55) 25) dialog: Okay.   I'll see you tomorrow.
55) 28) dialog: Most expensive phone call I ever made.
55) 45) dialog: You need to promise me something, though. You won't investigate my girlfriend--she's, she don't know any better.
55) 49) dialog: I'll take care of it.
57) 14) dialog: You gonna leave me all alone out there?
57) 21) dialog: You come up with that one all by yourself?
58) 12) dialog: I--I need to talk to you.
58) 20) dialog: I--I'm gonna inform. For the police.
58) 27) dialog: I had to do it, Rosario. These motherfuckers--they were gonna come after my father.
58) 32) dialog: He ain't ever gonna find out.    He ain't ever gonna know.
58) 41) dialog: I don't know... I'd, I'd probably have to go into protection.
58) 46) dialog: But that's never gonna happen!
58) 51) dialog: Rosario, listen--I had to do it.
58) 54) dialog: I had to do it...
58) 57) dialog: Everything's gonna be all right... Don't worry, it'll be all right...
59) 5) dialog: Yeah... Sorry, buddy--I got some legal shit to deal with, from the raid... But I ain't forgot about you--I'll be back soon.
59) 19) dialog: No, it's okay--I'll talk to him later...
60) 3) dialog: Where's Vadim.
60) 7) dialog: 
65) 10) dialog: You know me.
71) 22) dialog: That's all the money I got.    And I ain't gonna leave it alone.
71) 30) dialog: From my savings. From El Caribe and Rasputin.
71) 49) dialog: Sounds good.
71) 54) dialog: I took a little taste.
71) 61) dialog: I'm clean.
71) 68) dialog: You wanna search me again, you go `head. I just wanna make this deal and go home.
71) 75) dialog: I'm gonna get pussy from this...
71) 81) dialog: [When] this deal goes down, I'm, I'm gonna get a lotta pussy...
76) 4) dialog: I'm with you!     I'm with YOU!
81) 3) dialog: I'll be all right, Pop.
81) 8) dialog: I need you to get my girlfriend, Pop. I need her to come with me.
83) 13) dialog: Yeah. They let me come--long as I brought these guys with me.
83) 18) dialog: Good... It's rehabbing good, for only nine weeks.
83) 22) dialog: Anyway, it ain't nothing compared to my brother, so...
83) 30) dialog: Just hold on, `til he gets here.
83) 43) dialog: I'm not sure yet... We been thinking about moving down to Miami. Guy I used to work for, his brother's got a place down there.
83) 48) dialog: A lotta kids here, lotta family... It's nice, ain't it...?
83) 51) dialog: You know how happy I am you're with me?
87) 14) dialog: I'm real glad you're home...
87) 32) dialog: What're you talking about? They got a lot of food over there--why don't you go eat something?
87) 37) dialog: 
87) 44) dialog: We gotta straighten this out later.
88) 24) dialog: That don't mean nothing.
88) 35) dialog: There's a whole network full of suppliers. The organization goes deep.
88) 44) dialog: I'll be outside if you need me.
89) 7) dialog: Well, why's he goin' back to work so soon, anyway? He ain't ready.
89) 24) dialog: POP--
89) 28) dialog: No, come on! I don't want that!
89) 34) dialog: (to the Guard) Take me back to the motel.
91) 3) dialog: Rosario?    Rosario!
91) 6) dialog: WHERE THE FUCK IS SHE?!?
92) 9) dialog: The cops're right outside--let's go. (beat; louder) I said, let's go!
92) 22) dialog: Lou--no more of this for her.   It's too fuckin' dangerous now.
92) 33) dialog: Yeah--we'll talk later, buddy--I'll call you. But right now I need to get her outta here.
93) 3) dialog: You gotta put everything in jeopardy? Huh?
93) 7) dialog: You know, I don't think you realize how serious this is?
93) 13) dialog: 
93) 19) dialog: I know. But I'm workin' on it, I am. (looks around; then) Soon as the trial's over and I get my money back outta impound-- everything'll get better, you'll see.
93) 25) dialog: Rosario--once this's done, we'll go down to Miami... [It'll] be a new thing for us--a lotta opportunities...
93) 29) dialog: C'mon... Let's go back--this'll all be over soon. I promise...
96) 3) dialog: Thank you... You know Mr. Buzhayev, I come to see you today `cause...with everything that's gone on, I don't think it's a good idea for me to stay in New York anymore. I was hoping maybe you could ask your brother if I could work with him, down in Miami. On his restaurant.
96) 14) dialog: I'd appreciate it.
96) 19) dialog: You always been very important to me too. (checks his watch) I should probably go now.
104) 5) dialog: Yeah, maybe. Why don't we give `em all these bags to throw out--it's becoming a mess.
104) 8) dialog: What's goin' on?
104) 12) dialog: What--?
104) 16) dialog: Jesus...   What about--
105) 6) dialog: You see something out there?
105) 17) dialog: Pop?   Joe come close this morning?
105) 28) dialog: Yeah, maybe.   But you know the way he is.
105) 35) dialog: (relents a bit; nods) I know, Pop.
107) 5) dialog: It's really coming down...
107) 10) dialog: Hey--Vitt--I think somethin's on our right!
107) 19) dialog: Get down!
107) 40) dialog: Rosario!   You hurt?
107) 61) dialog: Pop, lay back!
108) 14) dialog: Don't fuckin' look at him! I said don't--back up! Don't look at him...
109) 11) dialog: Does my brother know yet?
109) 17) dialog: Then you gotta take me to him...
110) 3) dialog: Joseph?
110) 12) dialog: I don't know if I can do that.   I MEAN--
110) 16) dialog: I wanna stay close to you from now on, Joe... (into J's ear) I wanna stay with you...
112) 3) dialog: You gonna fuckin' catch these guys?
112) 6) dialog: You ain't got nothing, do you.
112) 12) dialog: (growing emotional) You gotta find that spot...
113) 6) dialog: Course...
113) 20) dialog: No.... I did it to hurt him...   I disappointed him...
114) 4) dialog: I can't live like this no more, Mike... They destroyed my family.
114) 10) dialog: I, I could join you.
114) 21) dialog: My Pop tol' me you pull guys outta the Academy, guys with special knowledge, [and] make `em cops? You could do that.
114) 25) dialog: 
114) 32) dialog: I know.
114) 37) dialog: Joe, I'm gonna join you. I just decided...
114) 41) dialog: This is where I belong...
114) 55) dialog: I wanna talk to you about something.
114) 58) dialog: I'm thinking of...maybe joining the Force.
114) 61) dialog: I mean, I help find Nezhinski, we don't gotta live like this the rest of our lives--moving every three fuckin' days...
114) 66) dialog: What're you talking about? I just got through telling you--
114) 70) dialog: (struggling to stay
114) 80) dialog: Hold on a second--I know what I'm talking about'd be a change.
114) 87) dialog: But we could make a life here. This'd be something we could build on. We could raise a family, and...
114) 90) dialog: Pretty soon you'd fit in.
114) 95) dialog: They'll accept you if we're TOGETHER--
114) 102) dialog: Gave it up? Gave up what? (beat; explodes) GAVE UP WHAT, ROSARIO?!?
114) 108) dialog: What fuckin' life did you have? You're a fuckin' cokehead--look at you!
114) 112) dialog: Well, maybe I was a piece of shit too! Wasting my goddamned time!
114) 117) dialog: Wake up!   All that was nothing!
114) 121) dialog: My brother's gonna be all right-- and nothing's gonna happen to me.
114) 126) dialog: Hey--where you goin'--
114) 132) dialog: What the fuck you doin'?
114) 147) dialog: All right. Why don't you just calm down and think about it a little.
114) 150) dialog: You think about it, you'll feel different. You'll understand. And in time, we'll look back on all this and you'll see I was right. Look--I love you.
114) 160) text: We PAN AROUND to REVEAL: BOBBY GREEN, as he steps forward in FORMAL POLICE UNIFORM. His HAIR is cut, closely-croppe now. He is clean shaven. A REAL PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION.

117) 38) dialog: You're trying to do everything-- it's gonna kill you.
117) 42) dialog: We could handle it. I mean, I come on to help you--
117) 53) dialog: I know. But you don't gotta do everything yourself. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
117) 56) dialog: Joe, what's wrong? Come on, you can tell me.
117) 62) dialog: Nah, you didn't do nothing. It's meant to be. You can't fuckin' control it...
117) 69) dialog: Tell her I'm on my way back now. (to Joseph) Don't worry.
117) 75) dialog: That's all in the past. (kisses him) I'll see you later.

121) 45) dialog: (hesitates; then) Rosario--Rosario's gone down to Florida for a little while.
121) 50) dialog: Yeah... (more interior) You know, I was just thinking `bout when I first met her here... Working back there...
121) 63) dialog: Louis--? (Lou turns to him) How'd you know where I was staying?
121) 67) dialog: How'd you know where I was staying?
121) 73) dialog: It wasn't in no papers, Louis. Don't make me embarrass you. Let's go outside, right now.
122) 3) dialog: Where's Nezhinski?
122) 7) dialog: Don't play games with me, Louis.
122) 11) dialog: I just said, DO NOT PLAY GAMES WITH ME!
