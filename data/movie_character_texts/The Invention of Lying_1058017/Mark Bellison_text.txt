38) 26) text: MARK (V.O.) (cont'd) It's a game of numbers: there is only one of me who knows I have brown eyes, and so many of them who do not. The numbers always win.

44) 34) text: Mark didn't expect this answer.
44) 36) dialog: Well, I don't know, maybe we might enjoy it. Maybe we'd be good together and could have a happy life, raise a family together.
