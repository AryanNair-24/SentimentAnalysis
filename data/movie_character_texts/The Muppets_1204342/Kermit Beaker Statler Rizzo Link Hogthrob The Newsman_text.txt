A fr photo of a Time magazine cover which features Kermit stan in front of the rest of the Muppets with a headline that reads “Who's the funniest Muppet.” There is also a row of framed photos, the first is of a y boy with a nondescript brown Puppet. We follow the row of photos as the boy grows progressively older, his puppet always by his side, ageless. We reach the last photo of t row and the boy is now thirty, arm around his puppet. We continue to pan and find the man, Gary, laying in bed peacefully asleep, a contented smile on his face. THE ALA GOES OFF. Gary lazily wakes up.

Like a scene from the Wizard of Oz, Gary, Walter Mary stand frozen as the huge gates open to Kermit’s mans After a long beat, Kermit emerges from his front door and walks towards them. He looks the same physically, but he walks very slowly with a cane and wears a Hugh Hefneresqu smoking jacket. As he limps towards them, our group takes what is by any stretch, a sad sight. Kermit is old.
13) 23) dialog: Are you crying? No, I was just... He throws down his cane, does a perfect summersault, and begins tap dancing. The gang watches confused.

When he reaches the end of the hallway, he awkwardly turns around and sings about the same memories passed once again, however, this time he sings about how impossible it’ll be to get back together because they all have gripes with each other now.
13) 42) dialog: (a song version of this) We would need someone to rally around, someone young and innocent and not specifically any one sort of animal or figure in particular. Someone like...well... (reaching Walter) «you. 17.
