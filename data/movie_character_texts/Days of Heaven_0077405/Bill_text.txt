Benson, meanwhile, bounds down the hill to Chuck's side. His left sleeve has been burned away. The flesh beneath is the color of a raw steak.

Then, in a rush of compassion for them all, she throws her arms around him. Bill wonders if she is taking him back. Might their differences all have been a terrible misunderstanding?

157) 0) text: They glide along in the hush of evening. The reeds are full of deer. Cranes, imprudently tame, dance on the sand bars. Bill looks around in wonder. He knows these may be his last days on earth. Abby throws a sounding line. A COUPLE from a local farm seeks privacy in the willows. Other BOATMEN glide past in silence. A CHILD plays a fiddle on the deck of a scow. HUNTERS creep along the shore in search of waterfowl.

Overhead, finches tilt from branch to branch. A light wind rushes through the leaves. Whatever his trou- bles, they seem very small to him in the great. scheme of things. He looks at Abby, mouthing silent words in her sleep. He puts on a white scarf and starts down to the boat. The slope is strewn with sodden cartons, burnt bricks and bur mattresses, an avalanche of urban excreta.
161) 4) dialog: Keep down. Can't explain now. They're here.
161) 6) dialog: Don't get shot. Look for me under that next bridge down.  After dark. He empties out the contents of his pockets -- a watch, a couple of dollars in change, a ring -- and slaps them dow in front of her. The Police fan out along the ridge above them. He jams a flare pistol into his belt and kisses her goodbye--after a moment's hesitation -- on the cheek. She tries in vain to hold him back.
161) 7) dialog: I wish I could tell you how much I love you.

Suddenly he runs into a trot line that a fisherman has left out overnight. The hooks bite into his thigh and shoulder, yanking a string of startled, thrashing catfish out of the water. He keeps running in a panic, not realizing the line is staked to the shore. All at once, he jackknifes in the air. The stake twangs loose. The Police now spot him  and begin firing.
162) 3) text: Bill stumbles along, trying to rip the hooks from his flesh, but the fish--fighting their way back to the water--only drive them in deeper. Ahead two MOUNTED POLICE surge into the river, blocking his retreat. He empties his shotgun at them and throws it away. They hold up, astonished. He dashes across a sand bar for the deep of the river and comparative safety. Black mud cling to his feet, drawing him down like a fly in molasses. Benson goes running out into the river ahead of the Polic
162) 5) text: Bill's blood fades off quickly in the gliding water of th river. The line of frightened catfish dances out behind him like a garland.
