44) 17) dialog: Then...you're in a state of conflict, Jeff. Jeffrey doesn't say anything.
44) 18) dialog: Because, look, here's how it lays out: if you got vital, insider stuff the American people for their welfare really do need to know...and you feel impelled to disclose it and violate your agreement in doing so, that's one thing.  On the other hand, if you want to honor this agreement, then that's simple.  You do so.  You say nothing.  You do nothing. There's only one guy who can figure that out for you.  And that's you.

45) 15) dialog: That's not good enough.  This guy is the top scientist in the number three tobacco company in America.  He's a corporate officer.  You never get whistle-blowers from Fortune 500 companies.  This guy is the ultimate insider.  He's got something to say; he wants to say it; I want it on "60 Minutes."

45) 33) dialog: (seriously)

64) 28) dialog: You should.  Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend.  And that's the power you have.
64) 30) dialog: I believe that?  Yes, I believe that.

No.  Because he is telling the truth.  That's why we're not going to air it.  And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
