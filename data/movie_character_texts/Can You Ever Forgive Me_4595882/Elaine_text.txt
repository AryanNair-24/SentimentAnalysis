79) 11) dialog: Was she? (beat) I’m so sorry, Lee.
79) 13) dialog: You going to get another?
79) 15) dialog: Maybe in time.
79) 17) dialog: Oh god, I haven’t thought about that place in years! It’s still there? On 96th?
79) 19) dialog: (beat) You still on 82nd?
79) 21) dialog: You look all right. You all right?
