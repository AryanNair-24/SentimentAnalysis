32) 3) dialog: (beat) Wouldn’t it be incredible if once you’ve passed on, people were selling your letters?

32) 30) dialog: Only recently.
32) 32) dialog: I wasn’t sure about the frames.
32) 34) dialog: I used to have perfect vision. (smiles) Don’t you love getting older and watching your parts - fall apart!
32) 39) dialog: Hardly. I really thought I’d have more accomplished by this time in my life.
32) 41) dialog: Yes, I inherited it. Truth be told, it’s more pressure than I thought. Oh?
32) 43) dialog: My father took a lot of pride in it. Almost too much! He was very choosy and almost snobbish about his inventory. I try to live up to that - run it how he would run it. Silence. Lee has become more uncomfortable. She drinks quickly. ANNA (CONT’D) So, you’ve been here before?
