77) 0) text: 150 In a simple, nearly empty courtroom, Lee and Lloyd stand before the JUDGE. (CONTINUED)
77) 5) dialog: (to Lee) Before I render my verdict, have you in the last twenty-four hours used drugs, pills, alcohol, anything that could affect your ability to understand what is going on? No ma’am.
77) 7) dialog: Have you anything additional you would like to say to the court before I offer your sentence? Yes.
77) 15) dialog: Lee Israel, the court sentences you to five years probation plus six months house arrest. You may only leave home to go to and from your place of employment, your work in the community, and to alcoholic’s anonymous meetings.
77) 17) dialog: You are not to leave the state or consort with felons and you are to pay restitution to your victims within your means. Lloyd grins at Lee, nodding. Lee stares, in disbelief.
