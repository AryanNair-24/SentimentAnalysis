77) 10) dialog: I don’t. I thoroughly enjoyed writing these letters, living in the world of Dorothy Parker and Noel Coward, pretending I was something I am not.

LEE’S VOICE My dear sir, I offer my droopy salutations from the Great Beyond. I understand that you’re selling my personal letters to the tune of nearly two grand.
