It was when I was at boarding school and they were getting ready for the school Centennial Celebration and they put all the fireworks and food and stuff in this room in the West Wing. Well, on the floor above they had the Chemistry Lab and I had to stay in and clean it up. So I thought I'd doa little experimenting. I got all this stuff out and began mixing it up. It was very scientific. I was measuring the amounts. Well, suddenly there was this big fizzing sound and this white kind of porridge stuff began erupting out of the beaker, and moving along the desk and falling onto the floor. It was making an awful mess. So I got the hose to try to spray it haroldandmaudehomepage.com/xhigginnsscreenplay txt 59/105 3/6/12 haroldandmaudehomepage.com/xhigginnsscreenplay. txt into the sink. I turned on the water and - POW! There was this massive explosion. Knocked me down. Blew out the floor. Boards and brick and flames leaping up. Singed my hair. Smoke everywhere. I got up, then this sound like bombs going off. It was the fireworks in the room below. And all this stuff came flying out the hole. PACHAU! Skyrockets and pinwheels. And fire balls all whizzing and bouncing. And I was just standing there stunned - I couldn't believe it - just watching - being pelted by all these little pellets - turns out to be the goddamn popcorn spewed up from below. The whole place was a crazy inferno with the rockets and everything, and I couldn't get to the door. But behind me was this old laundry chute, so I hopped in that and slid down that to the basement. When I got outside I saw that the whole top of the building was on fire and, of course, it was pandemonium with people running around and fire alarms ringing. So I decided to go home. When I get there my mother is having this big party so I creep up the back stairs to my room. Then there is this ring on the doorbell. It's the police. I creep over to the banister to see what they say, and they tell my mother that I had been killed in a fire at school. Well, everyone got very quiet.
