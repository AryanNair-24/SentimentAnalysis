13) 1) dialog: That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging. (taking copious notes) Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for fun?

32) 23) dialog: We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment.

Of course, what puzzles me, Harold, is that you want to sleep with your grandmother.
