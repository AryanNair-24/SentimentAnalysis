A hundred yards away on the cemetery bench sits an old woman eating a tangerine. This is MAUDE. Harold stares at her. She seems to be having some kind of happy picnic. She looks over towards him.

The two women look to Mrs. Chasen for some explanation. Mrs. Chasen smiles lamely.

(fluttery laugh) How absurd. Her eye catches a dour portrait of the Blessed Virgin and Child on a pillar. With one swoop she takes a felt pen from Harold's breast pocket and draws on the painting a bright and cheery smile. Harold is stunned.
20) 19) dialog: There, that's better. They never give the poor thing a chance to laugh. Heaven knows she has a lot to be happy about. In fact... (she looks thought- fully around the church) - they all have a lot to be happy about. Excuse me.

27) 1) dialog: What a delight it is, Harold, to bump into you again. I knew we were going to be good friends the moment I saw you. You go to funerals often, don't you? Harold is more intent on Maude's maneuvering of his car than on conversation.

It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition. (fluttery laugh as she remembers) A long time ago.
