83) 1) dialog: Harold, I want you to look at me like your father in this matter. We'll spend the day just getting to know each other. Now, I know that you have no great desire to join the Army.

84) 1) dialog: Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.

Now, I don't want to remind you of the unpleasant ident that occurred the other day. I think it is best if we consider that forgotten. But I do think that it would be wisest for you not to leave the house or indulge in any kind of activity that would be newsworthy. This marriage would attract attention, and, frankly Harold, I don't think you need a wife. You need a nurse.
