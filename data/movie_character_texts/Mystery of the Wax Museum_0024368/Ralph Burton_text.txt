19) 175) text: Wheels angrily away. The workman laughs. CAMERA FOLLOWS  Igor as he wheels to end of museum where Hugo and Ralph  are at work putting the finishing touches on two  individual figures. Hugo is a man of middle age, with  an insane, crafty face, unkempt hair and several days  growth of beard. He smiles continually to himself as  though some secret of his own amused him. He is deaf  and dumb and when excited or angry emits strange  terrifying growls similar to the noises we heard  the Monster utter. Ralph is rather a nice-looking  youngster and seems engrossed in what he is doing.

He carries the figure in such a  position that we see the back of it first, and as he  places it on the pedestal he turns it around so that we  see the face. CAMERA CONCENTRATES for several minutes  on this figure.

39) 3) text: The mute chuckles inanely as Ralph makes his exit.  After Ralph is gone, Hugo takes a black, loose ulster -- a couple of sizes too large -- and hat from the  hook, his clothes resembling those worn by the  Monster. Slipping into them, he exits from cloakroom  and disappears through a rear door.
45) 2) dialog: I wish you'd cut her out and get a  place by yourself.  (Looking after Florence.)
45) 6) dialog: She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't  like you living with her. She's a bad  influence.

As she passes  a niche in the wall that contains a half figure of Dante  on the platform, the CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE-UP of that  figure. The artificial lids are raised and we see the  eyes of a living person peering through and watching  her progress. Over this we hear her calling "Ralph"  again, but the call is growing fainter. The lids drop  back into place.
70) 10) text: Ralph! Ralph!
71) 0) text: Janitor is sweeping walk. Ralph comes into picture,  glances into museum and, assuming that he is the  first to arrive, takes a last puff on a cigarette  before entering. He throws it away and starts to  enter when we hear Florence's voice off scene.
71) 5) dialog: What are you people doing out in the  middle of the night?
71) 10) dialog: I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for  you to wait until the old man's here?
