15) 50) text: The men laugh. Florence produces a bottle of Scotch.
15) 55) dialog: I don't want to see him -- he hurts my eyes.
15) 59) dialog: (to dog) 
15) 65) dialog: He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly  and he's a police dog.
15) 70) dialog: Plain-clothes man.  (Addressing room.) 
15) 75) dialog: (laughs)
16) 1) text: (In the following scene we establish that, while he  quarrels continually throughout the picture with the  girl, there is an underlying and very strong bond of  friendship and respect between the two.)  The door opens and, as Florence appears, we hear the  last few words of her preceding speech. She closes  the door, leaning against it.
16) 3) dialog: As I live and breathe and wear spats ...  the prince.
16) 8) dialog: (disheveled and obviously  with an "edge")
16) 15) dialog: Charming. More delightful people crippled.
16) 19) dialog: Meaning what?

16) 31) dialog: (straightening up)
16) 36) dialog: Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
16) 37) text: He rises and, taking Florence angrily by the arm,  almost drags her to the window. He points to the  street below. There is an alternating red and green  light through the window, as though it came from an  electric sign across the street.
16) 40) text: Florence giggles.
16) 42) dialog: (With elaborate sarcasm)
16) 49) dialog: (turning to door, shouts)
16) 53) text: as Florence reenters. Sits on desk of last man she  spoke to.
16) 55) dialog: What a sense of humor that guy has. Thinks  a hangover is a Jewish holiday. I'm fired!
16) 59) dialog: Stories scarcer than caviar at a street  cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me  a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
16) 64) dialog: Hey, come here, Kelly. I don't want you  hanging around with that guy. He's been  reading naughty stories.
16) 76) text: Several uniformed men seated, reading late editions,  etc. Florence enters with gay, almost rowdy  camaraderie and thumps one of the officers on the  back.
16) 78) dialog: Happy New Year, Ambrose!
16) 83) text: Florence crosses to desk and, reaching over, pulls  the magazine out of the sergeant's hand.
16) 85) dialog: Happy New Year, sweetheart. How's your  sex life?  (Glances at magazine.) 
16) 91) dialog: How's every little thing?
16) 95) dialog: I'm people which the old year saw out.  I'm canned, fired!

16) 145) dialog: Make it snappy, Colonel.
16) 149) dialog: (starting through door)
16) 154) dialog: Thanks.
18) 44) dialog: I've got a case of jitters that will cop  the Pulitzer prize. If they drag this out  too long, they'll have another corpse on  their hands.
18) 90) dialog: No. It got up and walked down to the  cemetery to dig up a date.
18) 91) text: Detectives give Florence a dirty glance.
18) 96) dialog: Hot dog, death on a holiday! 
18) 99) text: Come on, Flannery! They leave the room hurriedly, followed by the  attendant. Florence, her hand to her head, sways.
18) 101) dialog: Boy, oh boy! And he asked for a story. Is  his face red! She looks around, sees phone,  grabs it up and calls for a number.

18) 118) dialog: (into phone) 
19) 0) text: Winton seated on the edge of his cot. CAMERA SWINGS AROUND to reveal the cell door being opened by a guard.  Florence enters and goes to boy. He is a rather  handsome, but weak, dissipated type, who arouses our  sympathy without winning our respect.
19) 2) dialog: How do you do. I'm from the Express.  Winton looks up. When he speaks, his sentences are  halting and broken. He's badly frightened.
19) 7) dialog: (Sits on cot beside him,  pats his shoulder)
19) 13) text: Florence follows him and places her hand on his shoulder.
19) 15) dialog: Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and  you can make it a whole lot easier for  yourself if you cut out the cry-baby  stuff --
19) 20) dialog: That's what I said.
19) 25) dialog: Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's  get down to cases. When did you see the  Dale girl last?
19) 29) dialog: Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the  police?
19) 34) dialog: Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said?  What did you talk about?
19) 39) dialog: I see. Was that all she said?
19) 44) dialog: You weren't going with her?
19) 49) dialog: Well, let's get back to the case in hand.  They ordered an autopsy and discovered  her body had been stolen from the morgue.
19) 54) dialog: Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you,  if you're on the square, and I think you  are.
19) 58) dialog: That happens to be the truth.
19) 62) dialog: That's what they're going to ask you.  Winton seems stunned. Guard appears in door.
19) 66) dialog: Be right with you.  (Turning, pats Winton  on shoulder.) 
19) 74) text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Florence, seated in chair  close to editor's desk.
19) 79) dialog: If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's  George Winton and they're playing him up.  It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat  editor in New York.
19) 84) dialog: I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would  hang him! And another thing, all this  gaga about the body disappearing. Eight  bodies have been stolen in New York  within the last eighteen months. Doesn't  it seem more reasonable to hook this up  from that angle?
19) 89) dialog: No, I mean it. I think this kid's  entitled to a break.
19) 93) dialog: You give me a pain!
19) 97) dialog: Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped  that body -- he was in jail.
19) 100) dialog: (rising angrily) 
19) 105) dialog: And they never proved anything against  him.
19) 109) dialog: Or was bumped off by someone who was  afraid of him.
19) 113) dialog: Well, that's got nothing to do with this  case. Can I handle this my way?
19) 117) dialog: All right, you said I was fired. Well, I  quit! Give the assignment to somebody  else.  (Starts toward door.)
19) 121) dialog: Nope, I'm through!
19) 126) dialog: On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen  Winton down there -- I'm not holding a  brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup,  but he's scared and hysterical -- and so  kinda dumb and worthless ...
19) 130) dialog: (going through door) 
19) 134) text: Holds picture that he drew away from him, looking at  it critically. Florence moves back of him to glance at  it. He hands it to her.
19) 140) dialog: Which one is me? The horse?

22) 0) text: A modestly furnished room. There is a studio couch,  right, on which Florence has been sleeping. She  straightens up, rubs her eyes, yawning, as Charlotte  turns away from phone.
22) 2) dialog: (as Charlotte turns  away from phone)
22) 7) dialog: I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch,  or did you invite him?
22) 10) text: Florence throws herself on bed, full-length, laughing.
22) 14) dialog: I just had a picture of you telling a  landlady some day that you didn't have  the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
22) 18) dialog: I met one last night ... all the money  this side of Peoria.
22) 22) dialog: In the can.  (Charlotte starts.) 
24) 0) text: Florence and Charlotte occupy the cab. Charlotte seems  indignant but Florence is amused.
24) 4) dialog: I don't have any affairs. What do you  mean?
24) 8) dialog: I've been in love so many times my heart  is calloused ... but I've never hit one  with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't  my idea of a way to spend a pleasant  afternoon.
24) 12) dialog: All right, you raise the kids -- I'll  raise the roof. I'd rather die with an  athletic heart from shaking cocktails and  bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty  dish water.
24) 16) dialog: He can look like a chimpanzee and act  like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
24) 20) dialog: Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the  happiest couple in the world.
25) 0) text: as Ralph, consulting his watch, approaches window and looks out. Through window we see a cab arriving. The  two girls emerge from cab. Florence stops to pay driver.  As Ralph turns from window and starts for his hat and  coat, CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A FULL SHOT. Ralph gets hat  and coat and starts toward door. Igor, who has been  near the front of museum, wheels out in front of Ralph.
25) 17) text: as Ralph enters to Charlotte and, taking both her  hands, kisses her lightly on cheek. He speaks to  Florence, who is standing beside Charlotte.
25) 21) dialog: Fine, thanks.
25) 25) dialog: Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
25) 31) text: As Ralph continues his explanation to Charlotte, CAMERA TRUCKS UP BEHIND Florence, and OVER HER SHOULDER THROUGH  glass panel we see interior of museum with the various  figures. Close to door we see the janitor carrying on his shoulder the Joan Gale figure which he places on a  pedestal in foreground. He carries the figure in such a  position that we see the back of it first, and as he  places it on the pedestal he turns it around so that we  see the face. CAMERA CONCENTRATES for several minutes  on this figure.
25) 32) text: Florence stares at it, puzzled. Then recognition dawns.  Ralph enters PAST CAMERA and goes to door. He is about  to hurry into museum, when Florence detains him by a  hand on his arm. As she turns, we get the two in  profile. Her expression is one of excitement.
25) 34) dialog: Listen, Genius, what're the chances for me  to slip in and give this place the once  over?
25) 42) dialog: He might get some publicity out of it.
25) 46) dialog: (looks through glass  panel to Igor)
25) 52) dialog: Horsefeathers!
26) 4) dialog: Aw, listen, Beaver, I'm from--
26) 17) text: Florence, taking advantage of the introduction, slips  away, as CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS, and, to avoid suspicion,  looks carefully at several figures during the  following conversation, finally arriving before the  Joan Gale figure, where she stops and studies the  figure carefully.
26) 32) text: Florence, who seems to have satisfied herself as  to the identity of the figure, turns abruptly  and comes toward them.
26) 34) dialog: Well, I'm a woman who craves nourishment.  Let's ankle out of here and find a beanery.  Come on, Moon-struck.  (Takes Charlotte by the arm.) 
26) 36) text: Sparrow, who has been hovering in the background,  approaches the group and stands just behind Igor's  chair. As Florence and Charlotte cross to door,  Charlotte smiles back at Igor.
26) 41) dialog: (to Igor) 
27) 0) text: The two girls come from building and are starting toward  corner when Florence, seeing a cab, signals to it. It  swings in to curb.
27) 2) dialog: Listen, Kid, I'm going to leave you flat.  I just thought of something and I've got  to get to the office.
27) 7) dialog: I'll have it for supper.  (Climbs into cab.) 
28) 26) dialog: Hello, Light-o'-my-life!
28) 31) dialog: I want to see the original pictures of  Joan Gale.
28) 46) dialog: So you can give me an argument and tell  me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
28) 52) dialog: (getting to her feet)
28) 56) text: Florence draws chair beside desk, drops into it and  leans over, talking excitedly.
28) 58) dialog: Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while  I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
28) 62) dialog: Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax  museum opening up down on 14th Street.
28) 66) dialog: I asked you to keep your trap shut!
28) 70) dialog: (rises indignantly)
28) 75) dialog: Just this -- I got a look at that dump a  little while ago and if they haven't got  a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up,  then I'm crazy.
28) 78) dialog: What!
28) 82) dialog: Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to  you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the  morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a  thing as a death mask?
28) 86) dialog: And it came to life and divorced you. I  know all about that. Now my idea is this:  Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes  impression, makes a mold, produces wax  figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this  old skate down there!
28) 89) dialog: Let it go.
28) 92) dialog: All right, Master Mind.  (Starts toward door.) 
28) 96) dialog: What do you mean?
28) 100) dialog: (With hand on knob)
28) 105) dialog: (laughs -- opens door) 
30) 26) dialog: (into phone)
30) 35) dialog: How do you feel by now? ... Yeh ... Well,  listen, if you're grateful, you can prove  it and maybe do yourself a good turn at  the same time ... Righto. Now at about  8:30 tonight you be in your car at--

32) 0) text: We see a skylight forced open, the Monster clambers  out onto the roof and creeps stealthily to edge,  peering into lighted window of apartment house. CAMERA  FOLLOWS him. SHOOTING PAST him into room beyond, we see Charlotte just putting the final touches to her toilette, preparing to put on dress. The Monster, gauging the  distance carefully, springs across space separating  buildings and clings to fire escape ladder like a huge  monkey. He leans out from ladder and is about to raise  window sash when the door of the room opens and Florence  enters.
33) 2) dialog: Come on, beautiful, leap into that  loin cloth.
33) 6) dialog: (patting stomach)
33) 11) dialog: Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't  step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
33) 15) dialog: I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I  see. And I've an appointment with young  Winton at 8:30.
33) 18) dialog: No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is  music in my ears, and when his old man  kicks off there'll be a million dollar  tune.
33) 23) dialog: Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
35) 7) text: During this speech Florence and Charlotte enter the  picture and start toward museum door. 
36) 14) dialog: Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
38) 5) dialog: as she inspects the Joan Gale figure. We see that all  doubt has been dispelled and that she is absolutely  sure of her ground. Glancing about quickly, to be sure  she is not observed, she stealthily sticks a pin into  the arm of the figure as if convincing herself it is  made of wax.
38) 34) text: You must come some time in the morning  when there are no crowds about and I  can give you more of my time. Florence enters and breaks up the conversation.
38) 36) dialog: Good evening, Mr. Igor. I've been  admiring your works. Properly illuminated,  they are more impressive than they were  this morning.
38) 40) dialog: I was particularly interested in that  group over there.  She points and CAMERA SWINGS TO
38) 57) dialog: You did this yourself?
38) 61) dialog: But who did it? Sparrow, who has been standing in background during  the preceding dialogue, listening nervously, now shows  extreme uneasiness as Igor replies.
41) 3) text: Florence shows agitated concern in looking after the  retreating figure of Sparrow.
42) 0) text: Winton, seated in roadster. He catches sight of Florence  and sounds the auto horn. She sees him and waves.

46) 3) dialog: Don't ask any questions right now. I  think we're on the trail of hot news.
48) 0) text: where we saw the mysterious box delivered. Sparrow walks  into picture and rings bell beside door on street level.  After a short pause, the door is opened and he disappears through it. The car carrying Winton and Florence passes  the house and, going to the next corner, stops.
48) 4) dialog: Well, as one of the interested parties, I  suppose I might as well tell you the glad  tidings. I think the fellow we've been  following had something to do with the  robbery at the morgue.
48) 9) dialog: Not even if it gives you a clean bill of  health?
48) 12) dialog: What! And let every rag in town grab a  red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around  the corner and wait for me.
48) 16) dialog: (jumping from car)
48) 22) dialog: I told you what to do. Drive around the  corner out of sight of the house. I want  to get a closer look at the place.
50) 0) text: Florence comes in and pauses and, glancing quickly up  and down the street, runs down steps to basement door,  which she tries cautiously. Finding it locked, she tries  to peer through window, and finally tries lower sash,  which opens. She climbs through window to basement.
52) 0) text: Florence is feeling her way about. She passes in front  of mirror, sees her own reflection, jumps back, startled, trips and sits down heavily on a pine box that might  contain a coffin. She gasps and springs to her feet,  terrified.
54) 0) text: Florence is raising up from inspection of box when she  sees the reflection of the Monster in mirror and drops  down behind the box. The figure of the Monster glides  into the room, stands as though listening for a moment  and then disappears in shadows. We hear someone  ascending a flight of rickety stairs.

56) 4) text: Winton tries to take Florence away. She tears loose.
56) 6) dialog: Listen, copper, get a load of this. While  you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I  run down this story ... my story. Consider  yourself my assistant.
56) 10) dialog: (shrugging) 
56) 16) dialog: How quaint. But I can go any place you  can.  (Shows her credentials.)
59) 0) text: The detective, evidently finding switch, has thrown on  lights. He is talking to Florence and Winton.
59) 4) dialog: Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't  like anything human. He hobbled and swayed  like a monkey, and the face, from the  glimpse I got of it in the light from the  street, was like an African war mask.
59) 8) dialog: I don't know what he was, but he made  Frankenstein look like a lily!  
60) 0) text: The officers and detective, with Florence and Winton,  approach basement door and cautiously start to descend  steps to basement.
61) 3) text: Lights come on as though switch were thrown on other  side of partition. Florence, Winton and two detectives  enter, followed by the two uniformed policemen.
61) 5) dialog: (points to the box) 
61) 13) text: One officer gets the hatchet and the others drag the  box a little nearer the center of the room and they  start to pry off the lid. As they pull one nail, it  comes out with a mournful shriek. Florence almost falls  over a smaller box in her effort to get away.
61) 15) dialog: Oh, what wouldn't I give for a slug of gin! With a terrific ripping sound, they finally succeed in  removing the lid. Everybody crowds forward to peer at  what they believe to be a corpse, as CAMERA COMES TO A
61) 20) dialog: (sinking back onto box,  extending hands and wiggling fingers) Oh, gimme, gimme!
61) 53) text: Florence starts piling bottles of whiskey on her arm  like an armload of cordwood.
61) 57) dialog: Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You  birds are going to get yours. And anyhow,  I found this dump.  She exits, followed by Winton. There is a general laugh. 
63) 0) text: Captain is seated at desk. He is laughing heartily at  Florence.
63) 2) dialog: Imagine my embarrassment. The razzing I'm  going to get is nobody's business. I tail  a corpse and stumble on a box full of  spirits and not a dead one in the layout. 
63) 6) dialog: Poison! It takes a sturdy person to look 
65) 2) dialog: (rising)

66) 25) dialog: --and so determined to live that I'm  going to get out and take a taxi if you  don't watch where you're going.
66) 29) dialog: It doesn't usually take that long, but  I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough  spot when I met you.
66) 33) dialog: Oh, is that what caused it?
66) 37) dialog: How much money have you got?
66) 41) dialog: Well, that being the case, I'll take it  up with the board of directors. Hey,  listen, aviator, here we are!  The car swings into the reporter's entrance of the  Express Building.
66) 43) dialog: Hold everything. I'll be right back.
67) 4) dialog: Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
67) 9) dialog: This one's a story, but I'm not going to  tell you what it is. Every time I tell  you anything it goes haywire.

71) 2) dialog: Hey -- Ralph!
71) 3) text: He looks up and we see that he recognizes someone  approaching, as Winton's car whirls up to the curb  and Florence jumps out, followed by Winton. 
71) 7) dialog: (crossing to him) 
71) 14) dialog: Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda  like the old gent and I'm trying to  build a special Sunday Magazine story  out of him. It might help him a whole  lot. But that's a side issue -- something  I do on my own time.
71) 19) dialog: No. I wanted to do it without saying  anything. I think he's worth it.
72) 8) text: Okay, brother.  (Shouts to Florence.) 
72) 9) text: Flo, I've got to find a place to park.  I'll be right back.  CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS taking in Ralph and Florence at museum door.

73) 0) text: Florence takes from her bag a photograph of Judge Ramsey.
73) 4) dialog: (studying the photo and  wax figure; she is nervously biting her  fingernails)
73) 9) text: That's what happens to girls who bite  their nails.  (Florence ignores the remark.) 
73) 11) text: Hugo passes them at this moment. Florence watches  Hugo suspiciously as if she did not want him to know  what she is referring to. She waits until he has  passed into the cloakroom.
73) 13) dialog: Look at this photograph, will you?  (Handing Ralph photograph.)
76) 1) text: Ralph is holding the photograph, and he and Florence  stand looking at the figure. We see that the features  of the two are identical. Then we hear a muffled scream.  Florence and Ralph look at each other inquiringly and  stand waiting for the scream to be repeated.
