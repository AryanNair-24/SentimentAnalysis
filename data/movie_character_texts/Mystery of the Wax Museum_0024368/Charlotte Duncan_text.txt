25) 31) text: As Ralph continues his explanation to Charlotte, CAMERA TRUCKS UP BEHIND Florence, and OVER HER SHOULDER THROUGH  glass panel we see interior of museum with the various  figures. Close to door we see the janitor carrying on his shoulder the Joan Gale figure which he places on a  pedestal in foreground. He carries the figure in such a  position that we see the back of it first, and as he  places it on the pedestal he turns it around so that we  see the face. CAMERA CONCENTRATES for several minutes  on this figure.

29) 0) text: Charlotte turns a corner and walks briskly TOWARD  CAMERA, finally turning into an apartment about a  quarter of the way down the block. As she disappears  into the building, Sparrow appears around the corner  and, walking past the building she entered, stops and  lights a cigarette, inspecting the building immediately  adjoining the apartment house. There is a large For  Sale or Rent sign on the front of the building, giving  the name and address of the agent handling the property.  Sparrow goes to a basement door and tries it, finding it  locked. He is investigating one of the windows when he  sees that he is observed by a passer-by, and, taking a  notebook from his pocket, apparently copies the name  and address of the realty firm from the sign, and walks  back in the direction from which he came, whistling. 
32) 0) text: We see a skylight forced open, the Monster clambers  out onto the roof and creeps stealthily to edge,  peering into lighted window of apartment house. CAMERA  FOLLOWS him. SHOOTING PAST him into room beyond, we see Charlotte just putting the final touches to her toilette, preparing to put on dress. The Monster, gauging the  distance carefully, springs across space separating  buildings and clings to fire escape ladder like a huge  monkey. He leans out from ladder and is about to raise  window sash when the door of the room opens and Florence  enters.

45) 4) dialog: But why? She's the best friend I've got.
45) 8) dialog: Nonsense. She's one of the nicest  girls I know.
45) 12) dialog: (heatedly) I won't let you say that!
45) 15) dialog: She thinks it's funny to talk the  way she does, but--
45) 20) dialog: Are we going to have the same quarrel  over again?
47) 2) dialog: Yes, certainly I would. And I'd be  terribly disappointed if you were stupid  enough to object to it.
47) 6) dialog: I'd call it stupid at any time.

69) 11) dialog: No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We  had a silly argument last night and I said  something unkind.
69) 16) dialog: But it was really my fault.
69) 21) dialog: I'd love to.
69) 24) dialog: Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much  trouble.
