The room is the product of three rooms which have been  knocked into one. It is very large and extremely well  constructed (as we are soon to learn, it was originally a laboratory). One half of the room is used for processing, and the other half for filming - and for trade shows. The two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perch all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glintin in the light. In the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a  'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls. Ther are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of  equipment above the 'dry'. This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frown in the ceiling above the benches. The other part of the room has a window at the far end of it. Heavy drapes are putted across it. Mark's projector rests on a small table in front of the  16mm screen.  Two banks of floods and a variety of spots  light this part of the room. There is a small control pan on the wall.   Some of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is old. All of it glistens with the affection of its owner. There is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone  except an adult... the kind who starts to wonder who paid for it all. CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He stands by the lighting panel,  watching Helen.

The darkness acquires a grey, opaque quality as if one is seeing the world through a curtain - it is the world of  Mrs. Stephens.

The  mirror entirely obscures both Mark and the camera. There  is a small hole in the mirror through which the lens of  the camera winks. As Helen looks at her terrified distort face this small hole gives her an extra eye in the middle of her forehead.
124) 74) dialog: Made them see their own terror as  the spike went in... and if death  has a face, they saw that too!

126) 12) text: Slowly he walks past his cameras. As he does, the metalli disc on each one explodes with a little plop - and the ey of each camera winks once as if in salute. Some go off  with flashlights on either side of the room. The sound of footsteps hurrying up the stairs. Ahead of Mark - coming steadily closer В— are the spikes the tripod. The mirror on the cine-camera reflects the  approach - and Helen's terrified face.
126) 14) text: The child's screaming reaches its peak as Mark approaches the spikes... Ahead of him, on the small table where his  projector stands, is Helen's book The Magic Camera.

WE SEE his face in the lens of the cine- camera. and WE SEE his hand - lying limp on the cover of  The Magic Camera. The Policemen hurry into the room. They stare motionless  at what they see. CLOSE SHOT of Helen - her face buried in her hands. The child's screaming stops suddenly... and in the absolu silence which follows WE HEAR the voice of Mark's father:
