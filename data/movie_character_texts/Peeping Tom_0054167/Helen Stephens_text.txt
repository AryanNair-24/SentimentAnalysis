21) 0) text: We can HEAR - faintly В— the dance music from downstairs. There is a click - and the walls are suddenly bathed in  diffused light, throwing the room into delicate shadow.  CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round in amazement. As certain events of possible interest are to take place  in this room, here, in detail, is what amazes Helen. The room is the product of three rooms which have been  knocked into one. It is very large and extremely well  constructed (as we are soon to learn, it was originally a laboratory). One half of the room is used for processing, and the other half for filming - and for trade shows. The two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perch all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glintin in the light. In the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a  'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls. Ther are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of  equipment above the 'dry'. This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frown in the ceiling above the benches. The other part of the room has a window at the far end of it. Heavy drapes are putted across it. Mark's projector rests on a small table in front of the  16mm screen.  Two banks of floods and a variety of spots  light this part of the room. There is a small control pan on the wall.   Some of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is old. All of it glistens with the affection of its owner. There is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone  except an adult... the kind who starts to wonder who paid for it all. CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He stands by the lighting panel,  watching Helen. From his POV WE SEE her brushing the hair out of her eyes as she looks slowly round. He brushes the hair out of his For a moment she turns her back to him. He presses a swit on the wall. A gentle light ripples through the back of  Helen's hair. SHOT of Helen. She turns to him. She is very nearly at a  loss for words.

21) 12) dialog: Then this equipment was his?
21) 16) dialog: But it seems to be so... technical.
21) 18) dialog: If this is where you work, I can't  wait to see what you work at.

Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE the surprise growing. Over  Helen's shoulder we see the screen. We are looking at a  small boy. He is lying in his bed asleep. Although the  print is old, we can see that he is a remarkably handsome boy.

(Mark's father now tries a not altogether successful  dissolve:) WE NOW SEE the little boy standing in front of a garden  wall. He tries hard to climb to the top of the wall, but  falls over. Helen laughs. Mark watches her in silence.  Small Mark tries again - and again - to scale the wall... At last he succeeds.

A beam of light starts to shine onto his eyes, first onto the left, then onto the right.
23) 1) dialog: (in a whisper) Again?
23) 2) text: Mark looks at her in silence. The boy moves restlessly, then turns over onto his face,  pulling the bedclothes round him. His right hand is limp  on the pillow. The light shines for a moment on this hand then goes out.  Helen half turns towards Mark.

23) 7) dialog: Mark, whatever is that?
23) 8) text: Her voice trails away. She stares - repelled and fascinat at the screen. WE SEE Mark reach for his cine-camera.  Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE the lizard reach the  counterpane. It stretches itself out on the floral design its body is pointed towards the child's hand. WE HEAR a click - and suddenly a spotlight falls onto  Helen's face. OVERLAID is the GENTLE PURRING of Mark's cine-camera. She wheels towards him - blotting out the small screen.
