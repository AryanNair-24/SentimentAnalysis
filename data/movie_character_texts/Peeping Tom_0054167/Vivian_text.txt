It remains dark for a moment. Suddenly the darkness parts like curtains - and in the  centre WE SEE Vivian's face in the finder of the studio  camera. (Unlike the ground-glass of the newsagent's camer we see everything the right way up and in perfect  perspective.) Mark hooks a filler-light below the camera and switches i on.

In the finder WE SEE a large trunk - 'at greatly reduced  prices' В— on the shelf behind Vivian. From Vivian's POV WE SEE Mark leave the studio camera В—  and hurry towards the trunks. She watches him wide-eyed.
49) 40) dialog: What are you doing?
49) 43) dialog: Why not pull the studio down while  you're about it? They can only  hang you once.

54) 1) dialog: Am I supposed to imagine someone  is going to put me in there?
54) 4) text: He peers into the viewfinder. In the finder we see Vivian looking rather pathetically into camera.
54) 5) dialog: Mark - I hope I won't let you  down... I know you're trying to  create atmosphere for me - but...  I just don't feel frightened!  Wouldn't it be better if I just  did my number?
54) 7) dialog: Oh all right! I could do anything -  I feel so relaxed - and that's due  to you... You're so at home with  that camera you make me feel at  home too... you have it in you,  boy!

57) 5) dialog: That..?
58) 0) text: CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is holding his cine-camera; fixed to it is a collapsib tripod.  Suddenly he pulls one leg of the tripod out. WE SEE that very sharp spike protrudes from the end of it. From Mark's POV WE SEE Vivian looking at the spike. He raises it towards her - until the spike is only inches from her throat.
58) 1) dialog: Yes... that would be frightening!
58) 3) text: We can hear his heart pounding as if it will burst - and  gradually Vivian, too, becomes aware of it.
58) 4) dialog: Well? What is it?

58) 13) text: It is almost a scream. We can hear Mark breathing quickly.  Vivian raises her hands to push something away from her. Suddenly the screen is filled with her eyes. WE SEE them  dilating with terror. There is a sudden crash as the big  power switches go out in the roof. The lights go out. There is a scream in the darkness. Then silence. The darkness acquires a grey, opaque quality as if one is seeing the world through a curtain - it is the world of  Mrs. Stephens.   A bright light is felt, rather than seen, beating against our eyelids. It looms closer and stronger.
60) 5) text: Helen glances at her watch... then looks curiously round  the room. CLOSE SHOT of Vivian's recorder, placed on a chair. CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She picks it up and looks at it,  curiously, fingering the stops.

Once or twice he can't help glancing at an image. CLOSE UP of Vivian's face, in the image. Mark stops the motor and the drum, loosens the end of the film, spools up with a snap, slides the spool off and  hurries out with it. Mark hurries to his projector, threads the film and start the projector. He flicks it on, as if it were a gramophon then looks eagerly at the 16mm screen.   Behind him something moves in the shadows  REVERSE SHOT of Mark.   Over the shoulder of someone who is standing deep in the  shadows WE SEE Mark. His head obscures what he is watchin on the screen.
