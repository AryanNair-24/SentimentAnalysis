She is so perpetually drunk as almost to be sober. The fe movements she makes are slow - deliberate - and give noth away. The voice articulates so carefully that the slur  scarcely shows.

WE SEE them  dilating with terror. There is a sudden crash as the big  power switches go out in the roof. The lights go out. There is a scream in the darkness. Then silence. The darkness acquires a grey, opaque quality as if one is seeing the world through a curtain - it is the world of  Mrs. Stephens.   A bright light is felt, rather than seen, beating against our eyelids. It looms closer and stronger.

CLOSE SHOT of the stick. It is a shooting stick - with a  sharp spike on the end of it, similar to the tripod on  Mark's camera. Mark stares at the stick, fascinated. CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens - exploring the inside of the black cloth bag with her free hand.
90) 24) dialog: Cloth... with something hard inside  it...

Black out into the grey darkness of Mrs. Stephens' world. WE HEAR the purring of Mark's camera - more clearly than  we have yet heard it. (There is the faint rasp of a cog  which needs oiling.) The sound of footsteps approaching.. the purring changes direction.

90) 88) dialog: Can't you find some - to please  Helen?
90) 90) dialog: You don't trust yourself to take  any more, do you?
91) 1) dialog: Instinct's a wonderful thing, isn't  it Mark? A pity it can't be  photographed.
91) 3) dialog: if I'd listened to it years ago, I  might have kept my sight. (she approaches the  door) I wouldn't have let a man operate  I had no faith in... so I'm  listening to it now... (she puts her face  close to him) It says all this filming isn't  healthy - and that you need help...
91) 5) dialog: ... get it, Mark... get it  quickly... and until you've got  it... I don't want you and Helen  to see each...
91) 7) dialog: I'd rather you don't have the  chance.
