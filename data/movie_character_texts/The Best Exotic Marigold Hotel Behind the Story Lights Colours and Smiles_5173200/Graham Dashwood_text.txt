2) 1) dialog: Bloody retirement parties. Hard cheese, soft wine, and endless speeches. Why do people do that? No one ever said about any kind of party: it was a wonderful occasion, just a shame that the speeches were so short.
2) 3) dialog: One day very soon.
3) 8) dialog: This is the day. Everyone looks round at him. He's almost as surprised as they are that he's spoken out loud.

60) 0) text: Some kids playing cricket. The rickshaw weaves its way through them and comes to a halt. Graham gets out, and stands in the street, dwarfed by a huge modern building, some months away from completion.
60) 1) dialog: This can't be right, surely?
60) 3) dialog: But there were houses all along here . these were homes.
60) 5) dialog: No. That'll do for now. Thank you. He hands over some money, and Pravesh pedals away. Graham turns to look at the boys playing cricket. One of them, SANJAY, is batting.

As Graham watches Sanjay running towards him, Sanjay seem to slow, his movements becoming sluggish, never seeming t reach the crease. He looks at the faces of the other boys frozen, waiting. The ball seems to take forever to leave Sanjay's hand. Graham steps back, completely fails to play a stroke, and is bowled.

71) 2) dialog: Mrs Ainslie. I hope you had a good day. What did you get up to?
71) 4) dialog: Why would you not go out? There's so much to see. Jean had hoped for some appreciation of her wit, and is floored by his question. She can hardly understand, let alone tell him, the depths of her discomfort.
71) 5) dialog: Open your eyes, Mrs Ainslie. All life is here, I tell you. Jean stares at him. He goes on through the archway into the hotel. Then stops.

74) 5) dialog: Can I show you something?
75) 0) text: Moments later. Evelyn is sitting in front of Graham's collage.
75) 1) dialog: I grew up here. Just a short drive away. It was a big house, and we had servants, everyone did. We knew their wives, their children. One boy, Manoj, became my friend. We played a lot of cricket together, played anything we could. And that's how it stayed for years. Until one night, he became something more.
75) 9) dialog: 
75) 13) dialog: And now I think .. what if I am the last person on earth he wants to see? Evelyn says nothing.
75) 14) dialog: I don't think I can go through with it.
75) 16) dialog: Yes. Yes. Oh yes.
81) 3) dialog: She won't speak English. She's what used to be called an Untouchable. An outcast, born below society. To a good Hindu, even her shadow is polluted. He greets Anokhi in Hindi, and heads for the door.
81) 10) dialog: I don't think so. I'm gay. Although nowadays more in theory than practice. Good day. He leaves. A moment later, Jean comes rushing out. Immediately she realises two things; first, that Graham h already gone. And second, that Muriel is watching her.

106) 0) text: Later. Jean and Graham are sitting in an elegant tea room Jean is still very shaken.
106) 2) dialog: Unutterable beauty. Everywhere. In the light, the colours, the smiles, the people who see life as a privilege not a right, and so teach me something every day. The waiter brings their tea.

116) 0) text: Graham, Evelyn, and Douglas are walking quickly up a quie street.
116) 1) dialog: It's a false alarm. There's no way they could find anything in that office. They probably just picked an address at random, just to keep me off their backs. I'm sure that's what happened. It's going to be nothing. Don't you think it's going to be nothing?
116) 3) dialog: Yes. Yes I should.

133) 10) dialog: Yes.
133) 12) dialog: (smiling, unperturbed) I didn't know how he'd been in the meantime, didn't want to guess. I brought disgrace upon him and his family, and imagined he might hate me for it.
