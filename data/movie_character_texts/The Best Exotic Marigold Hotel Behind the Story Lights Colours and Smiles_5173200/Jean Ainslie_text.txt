71) 3) dialog: Well, I started in my bedroom, where I had a lovely couple of hours giving all the cockroaches names. Then after a lunch that will long have a place in my heartburn, I came out here and stared blindly at a book waiting for someone - anyone to rescue me. And how glad I am it was you.
71) 7) dialog: I would appreciate that very much. Graham goes on in. Jean just sits there. Wishing he'd come back out again.

73) 21) dialog: Yes, where do you get to every day?
73) 23) dialog: I'm sure she wouldn't mind hearing it again. She waits. But Graham is as elusive as he is tactful.
73) 25) dialog: Did you hear that, Douglas? Plain grilled food; manna from heaven.
73) 28) dialog:

106) 8) dialog: Is it? She looks at him.
106) 15) dialog: To the bank. I . was going to the bank. Not that there's any reason to think something has changed. But our daughter, you see, she did promise, and one does try to remain optimistic. One has to. Otherwise

106) 22) dialog: As in ... happy? Graham says nothing. Jean lets go of his hand.
