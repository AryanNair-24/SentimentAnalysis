30) 0) text: Our heroes are squashed into a pair of them, facing forwards and backwards, attempting not to swallow too muc dust as they wheel crazily through the teeming morning streets of the city. They stare in amazement at the world racing past them. A scooter overtakes. A young man is driving, his girlfriend riding side-saddle on the back. Her sari billows out behind her.

56) 8) dialog: I'm sorry, I don't . I don't really have much ... She gives them the contents of her pockets.

If she's under 50 she'll be contemplating yet another diet, over 50 she'll have more or less given up, and be eating toast. The radio may be playing, or more likely daytime TV. A chat show, or a programme with a moderator speaking to a panel of young women whose boyfriends have all slept with their mothers. The girlfriends' mothers, I mean, not their own. Although Anyway, then the boyfriends usually come out, and everybody fights. Sunaina is in the audience. She calls out.
84) 3) dialog: That's the point. When the phone rings and it's this robot nobody wants a machine, but it's almost worse when it's a person behaving like one. All these sales cliches just strung together. 'Your call is important to us'. Is it? Well then sound like it.

160) 15) dialog: And you have told her that?
160) 17) dialog: Good. Women love it when you say that kind of thing. It's a powerful aphrodisiac.
160) 19) dialog: No, of course not. Go and find her right now, before you lose her forever. Her future is hers to choose, and so is yours. You can have anything you want, Sonny. You just need to stop waiting for someone to tell you you deserve it. Or you can just keep failing yourself, and hurting the ones you love -
