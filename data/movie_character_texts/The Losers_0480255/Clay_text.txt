0) 31) dialog: It's time...
1) 3) dialog: Authenticate and backtrace.
1) 14) dialog: We don't get to pick what needs to be done. (reading from tablet) Quaeda-wannabe name of Fadhil is running a terrorist assembly line out around the Khyber Pass--
1) 18) dialog: We find it, we paint it for a laser targeted bomb. No muss, no fuss.
2) 5) dialog: Paint it.
4) 9) dialog: Call it in.
4) 27) dialog: Mission Controller is Agency, Codename Max, repeat, Codename Max, so get him on the horn and-
4) 32) dialog: Cougar?
4) 35) dialog: Dropkick, this is Pinball, targeting equipment has suffered system failure, am calling an abort.
4) 41) dialog: Who is this? This is a secure
4) 46) dialog: Max? There are children on site-
4) 50) dialog: Shit! Jensen, call the General at the Firebase, get him to abort-
4) 60) dialog: There's something we can do.
4) 66) dialog: So?
5) 6) dialog: Pooch and Jensen, get a truck for the kids, the rest of us will be out in five-
5) 11) dialog: -out in four. On me! 9.
6) 8) dialog: (to Roque and Cougar) Get 'em out.
7) 11) dialog: You're American?
7) 15) dialog: 
7) 20) dialog: Max is rogue?
7) 27) dialog: Fadhil.
7) 34) dialog: I can get you out- 11.
12) 12) dialog: Lieutenant, you're to evac these civvies to the Firebase immediately-
12) 17) dialog: You really want to leave twenty three kids in the desert to die?
12) 22) dialog: Then it's them.
12) 37) dialog: 
12) 67) dialog: 
13) 4) dialog: He set up the Operation-
13) 8) dialog: I talked to him! 16.
13) 13) dialog: What?
13) 17) dialog: What are you talking-
13) 25) dialog: We didn't kill those kids, Wade. Wade studies him. Finally:
13) 39) dialog: (nodding to the case) Jensen?
13) 43) dialog: I don't care--Roque, Pooch, get those bars off!
13) 49) dialog: Time?
13) 55) dialog: 
21) 8) dialog: We lost again.
21) 13) dialog: You gave me the money. 20.
21) 20) dialog: Four.
21) 24) dialog: Yeah, I've just gone crazy with that approach.
21) 31) dialog: Maybe if we were drinking.
22) 3) dialog: We'll stay two more days, try to get some of the cash back.
22) 7) dialog: Miami. Jai-Alai.
22) 11) dialog: We're on the run. It occasionally
22) 17) dialog: All we did was say the word "Max" and they blew up a building. CIA even gets a whiff of where we're at, they'll call in an airstrike. (shakes his head) Until we figure out how we can take Max down and get clear, we lay low.
22) 22) dialog: Anytime you want to move along you go right ahead- 22.
22) 26) dialog: We heard his voice. Guy with a voice is a guy with a throat. And if he's got a throat...
22) 31) dialog: 
22) 38) dialog: Go. Roque FIRES UP THE ENGINE as the COPS get out of the cruiser. Pulling smoothly into the street...
23) 18) dialog: Meaty.
23) 21) dialog: Want a bite?
23) 24) dialog: Why not?
23) 28) dialog: Okay.
23) 33) dialog: (turning to her) I know you?
23) 37) dialog: Do I not look relaxed?
24) 6) dialog: No, I specifically requested the only hotel room in the world that doesn't have a bathroom.
25) 6) dialog: Convention.
25) 11) dialog: ...Air conditioners.
25) 18) dialog: You'd be surprised.
25) 24) dialog: You were about to tell me how much you enjoy spending time at the dog track... Aisha smiles, tracing her fingers down his stomach...
25) 29) dialog: Uh-huh...
25) 39) dialog: You're not going to.
25) 48) dialog: Noticed. What do you want?
25) 53) dialog: You want to clarify that?
25) 58) dialog: I'm listening.
26) 3) dialog: How'd you find me?
26) 8) dialog: How'd you know I was alive?
26) 12) dialog: Who else knows?
26) 15) dialog: So what's to stop me from putting a bullet in your head?
26) 19) dialog: Max is up to something big, isn't he? Agency wouldn't have sent you otherwise.
26) 27) dialog: Okay.
26) 30) dialog: Okay.
26) 34) dialog: Right.
26) 38) dialog: Is this a riddle?
26) 43) dialog: What a brilliant plan, and oh, so simple too. What's the cargo?
26) 46) dialog: Right. So you want me to steal some super secret cargo known only to you and the bad guy, and I'm supposed to do this because you know the name Max and look good in a pair of jeans? Sorry, sister. 29.
26) 51) dialog: Bye...
26) 59) dialog: How do I know I can trust you?
26) 63) dialog: I mostly Google porn. Then?
26) 67) dialog: Show-off. Then? 30.
26) 72) dialog: We're not mercenaries.
34) 3) dialog: Better than a ball pit...
34) 7) dialog: Name one time that-
34) 11) dialog: Carla wasn't the problem, Carla's husband was the problem-
34) 16) dialog: Okay. Yes. She shot me.
34) 21) dialog: Emma doesn't count, we never slept together.
34) 25) dialog: I admit, that took some of the romance out of the relationship. 35.
34) 29) dialog: I'm clear, Roque.
34) 49) dialog: She was volatile. Aisha, meet Pooch, Roque, and Cougar.
34) 62) dialog: What do you have on her?
34) 70) dialog: What else?
34) 90) dialog: I say we go with her. Pooch?
34) 95) dialog: Jensen? 38.
34) 107) dialog: And anyone who calls me "Colonel" better be ready to take a beating or an order. We ain't soldiers anymore.
34) 112) dialog: Sleep. We start tomorrow.
34) 116) dialog: We're going bird hunting.
44) 2) dialog: Go.
44) 5) dialog: Make the call. 43.
44) 21) dialog: Flip it. TIGHT SHOTS of the air ram attached to the undercarriage of the Humvee. The tires start to lift off the ground... higher... Four pairs of hands start rocking the truck...
44) 38) dialog: All right, everyone get into character...
44) 54) dialog: Here we go...
47) 14) dialog: Where's my wild goose?
48) 5) dialog: Hit it.
49) 29) dialog: Roque...
49) 35) dialog: No, you're not.
49) 39) dialog: No.
49) 44) dialog: See?
49) 58) dialog: I picked up on that.
49) 63) dialog: What do you think we are now? (to all of them) Best case scenario, this gets us face to face with Max-
55) 2) dialog: Are we wired?
68) 13) dialog: I don't think so.
68) 18) dialog: Gasoline. Muzzle flash. Think about it. AS THAT SINKS IN -- Fennel looks like his puppy just died
68) 21) dialog: Things'll kill you.
68) 24) dialog: Good boys. Now, let's see what kind of cargo you got in there.
68) 28) dialog: I'm already dead, remember?
68) 55) dialog: Yeah.
68) 63) dialog: Yeah. Jensen, you're up.
68) 68) dialog: The bomb.
68) 73) dialog: Get better.
68) 90) dialog: Then we die thirty seconds early - do it. 59.
68) 119) dialog: 
68) 125) dialog: Do you have time to reboot?
68) 162) dialog: Fennel.
69) 5) dialog: Elaborate.
69) 35) dialog: Where?
69) 42) dialog: So this hard drive - it contains evidence of what Max has been doing?
69) 47) dialog: Can you get us this drive?
70) 3) dialog: I say we hit Goliath headquarters.
70) 7) dialog: We find out if it exists. If it does, we steal it and trade it for immunity.
70) 12) dialog: You got a better one?
70) 16) dialog: Max gives us back our lives or we upload the data to the net, show the American people what's being done in their names.
70) 21) dialog: You want to give it back to him?
70) 25) dialog: It's not happening.
70) 30) dialog: You don't want Max to pay?
70) 39) dialog: Don't raise your voice at me-
70) 54) dialog: Aisha?
70) 65) dialog: You want your life back, you're gonna have to steal it. We hit them in two days.
76) 3) dialog: I was just going over the plan.
76) 6) dialog: You want to go over the plan?
76) 9) dialog: Let's go over the plan...
77) 6) dialog: 
77) 9) dialog: Why do you want Max dead?
77) 14) dialog: No.
77) 19) dialog: Fine. It's hot. There's lots of sand. Your turn.
77) 25) dialog: The guys got sick of it.
77) 29) dialog: Of hearing about Max. Of hearing me say we had to do something when there wasn't anything to do. They wanted to be around their families. Jensen has a sister. Pooch has a wife and daughters.
77) 33) dialog: Would you? The people you loved the most, would you put them in that kind of danger? Aisha, side-stepping the question:
77) 37) dialog: He's got me.
77) 41) dialog: Enough hate to get us both through the day. He stuck with me when no one else would. And I ain't the easiest guy to stick with.
77) 45) dialog: You think.
77) 49) dialog: Why? 74.
77) 53) dialog: And you think that's a weakness.
77) 57) dialog: We're not in the jungle.
78) 7) dialog: Pooch, we're on a schedule here-
78) 10) dialog: Sorry I hit you.
85) 12) dialog: You're sure?
85) 16) dialog: Is it in the building?
88) 5) dialog: Where's the drive being kept?
88) 15) dialog: What's "oh, shit"?
88) 20) dialog: 
88) 29) dialog: Goliath must have brought them in after we hit their truck...
88) 35) dialog: Comb that drive for every last scrap of info. We're on a plane for New York tomorrow...
89) 3) dialog: Oh, hi.
91) 3) dialog: You really want to know about Afghanistan?
93) 3) dialog: Max's true target. Yeah.
93) 7) dialog: He knew we were off mission. He knew Max wanted him dead...
93) 12) dialog: Excuse me?
93) 16) dialog: He begged to die--why are you asking me this?
93) 37) dialog: Wait.
95) 8) dialog: She ain't that lucky. Jensen, status!
95) 16) dialog: Somebody shoot something!
99) 4) dialog: 
99) 9) dialog: I know.
99) 14) dialog: 
99) 33) dialog: 
99) 39) dialog: There's nothing else we can do...
99) 44) dialog: Excuse me?
99) 48) dialog: What part of "he knows we're coming for it" do you not get? They're gonna be waiting for us. Par-Sec is gonna waiting for us... 95.
99) 59) dialog: Pooch, what's the minimum time to scout the patrols, get an accurate head count on-site at the Port?
99) 63) dialog: So we hit them in twelve.
99) 71) dialog: Jensen's already got the layout, and Cougar can spot on site. Right?
99) 74) dialog: Jensen?
99) 79) dialog: Pooch?
99) 84) dialog: So?
100) 5) dialog: You ready?
100) 8) dialog: Roque? 97.
101) 3) dialog: 
104) 3) dialog: Jensen, we're coming. You ready? 98.
106) 9) dialog: Roque and I will set the charges here but we won't detonate until you have the drive.
106) 12) dialog: What can I say, I hold a grudge.
106) 16) dialog: Be ready to move the second Cougar hits the fire alarm... 99.
109) 2) dialog: Are you kidding me?
111) 5) dialog: Something's not right. Something...
111) 11) dialog: What?
113) 3) dialog: You think... Aisha?
118) 6) dialog: When...?
118) 11) dialog: Traitor... 102.
118) 15) dialog: 
118) 20) dialog: No...
118) 24) dialog: We all could have walked... used the drive...
118) 41) dialog: Kill me now... Maybe you live through this.
118) 62) dialog: You're going to die very badly. The guards hustle Clay out the door...
119) 4) dialog: (answering the question) Roque.
121) 21) dialog: Kind of in the middle of something here, Jensen-
121) 27) dialog: (eyes on Aisha)
121) 56) dialog: Can you stand?
121) 61) dialog: Let's go.
122) 6) dialog: They won. We lost. Way it goes.
123) 20) dialog: Hi, Wade!
123) 34) dialog: Cougar and I are going after that plane. The rest of you, get Wade.
123) 57) dialog: I'm out.
123) 60) dialog: Get me closer...
125) 7) dialog: Aisha thinks you kill me.
125) 14) dialog: Don't need one.
125) 18) dialog: 
125) 36) dialog: 
125) 49) dialog: Rifle...
125) 69) dialog: Outstanding.
125) 75) dialog: Hello?
126) 5) dialog: Not by a longshot. You're not having a real great day, Max.
126) 9) dialog: Just a voice on the phone.
126) 13) dialog: Working on the engines. 116.
126) 18) dialog: It's Colonel.
126) 23) dialog: Thank you.
126) 27) dialog: I don't think the guys you're about to stiff for a billion dollars are going to allow that to happen. (looks to the others) We win. You lose. Goodbye.
126) 30) dialog: Lear jet?
126) 37) dialog: That why you slept with me? 117.
126) 42) dialog: You coming?
126) 47) dialog: Good cause there's no way I could walk it... She helps him up and we begin to PULL UP AND BACK as they head for the Hangar. Together.
