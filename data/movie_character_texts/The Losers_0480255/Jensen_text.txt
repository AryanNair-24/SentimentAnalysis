1) 16) dialog: I'm shocked. Shocked, I say.
2) 11) dialog: Dropkick, this is Pinball, confirmed eyes on, target is designated.
4) 2) dialog: Roger, we'll break out the earplugs. (to the others) So who wants to get a game? We got eight minutes-

4) 52) dialog: Can't, they're jamming us-
4) 56) dialog: (trying all channels) Negative, we're screwed!
10) 3) dialog: I think we're in the clear-
12) 3) dialog: Yeah, that was great, wasn't it? My favorite part was when we were completely on fire. What was yours?
12) 25) dialog: 
12) 47) dialog: Guys... This is bad...
13) 41) dialog: I'm not good with bombs, man-
13) 47) dialog: Oh, shit. Oh, shit...
13) 52) dialog: It's a remote detonator--enough for them to get clear, maybe ten
13) 58) dialog: I told you, I'm not good with bombs! How are those bars coming?
20) 0) text: Phoenix, Arizona. A late night internet cafe, wedged between a donut shop and spinning studio. JENSEN sits. Alone. Playing INTERACTIVE ON-LINE COMBAT...
34) 55) dialog: Hail, hail, the gang's all here! Colonel. Roque. Pooch. Silent Bob. Hottie.
34) 64) dialog: Besides a pants-busting crush?
34) 72) dialog: Grew up in Afghanistan, Mom was a local, Dad was white devil... oh, and CIA's got a kill order out on her.
34) 76) dialog: As does Hamas, Sien Fein, MOSAAD-- pretty much everyone with the exception of PETA wants this chick amscrayed.
34) 80) dialog: Last CIA email flagged with her name says she was digging for information about a special project... (looks up at them) "Codename: MAX". A moment as this sinks in.
34) 87) dialog: (finishing his question) -have been planted for us to find? (shaking his head) CIA timestamp, digital watermark... Someone would've had to go to a lot of trouble, and I mean a lot, to fool me.
34) 97) dialog: Hell yeah. Cougs?
34) 103) dialog: Hot damn! Back with the Colonel, doing another bid for God and

44) 13) dialog: Robert De Niro who?
44) 26) dialog: Classic loss of identity. Clay defined himself by his place in the military structure.
44) 30) dialog: It was his way of measuring the good he did in the world. Without it, he's just another loser like the rest of us.
44) 33) dialog: You know there's a website where you can download MP3's of donkeys farting? How cool is that?
44) 43) dialog: Lot of work to bum a ride.
44) 47) dialog: You shut up, Roque. You're dead, I'm the spinal injury - Spinal injury can talk, dead can't.
44) 51) dialog: Seriously, you have to get more into your role! Dead guy! No talking! Dead guy!
46) 5) dialog: Y-you ever treat anyone who'd been gut shot...
46) 10) dialog: Means you know what's coming to you if try to play hero. Now, lose the radio mic, Bones.
48) 3) dialog: We're all set here. Ready to take a giant step for... well, for guys who steal stuff, I guess.
48) 8) dialog: Beautiful. Let 'em chase that.
49) 5) dialog: So, you grew up in the Hindu Kush, huh? That must've been rough.
49) 9) dialog: Got any hobbies?
49) 14) dialog: I'm gonna go somewhere else now.
55) 4) dialog: Like Belushi.
68) 36) dialog: Goliath the oil company?
68) 46) dialog: Nah, I can bypass no problem.
68) 49) dialog: Voila! Ten million dollars of horse, comin' up!
68) 66) dialog: Huh?

68) 123) dialog: I told you, I'm not good at bombs!
68) 144) dialog: Opening it without the code must have triggered the timer...
69) 21) dialog: 
69) 26) dialog: Yeah, what would an oil company want with the Middle East?
69) 38) dialog: Come on, dude, they'd be morons to keep records of shit like this-
70) 51) dialog: Goliath. Cougs?
70) 68) dialog: Don'tcha hate it when Mom and Dad fight?
78) 32) dialog: 
79) 3) dialog: 
79) 7) dialog: Yo! Package for Henderson! 76.
79) 13) dialog: No can do, chica, gotta put it in his hands. He's gotta sign.
79) 17) dialog: Babydoll, I'm on the clock here!
80) 3) dialog: 
81) 3) dialog: 
81) 11) dialog: 
81) 13) dialog: Richard Hertz from Internal Security.
81) 17) dialog: Ladies... hi.
81) 20) dialog: Liking the angle of the dangle?
82) 6) dialog: Good afternoon, Mr. Henderson, Richard Hertz from Internal Security. If you'd be kind enough to make your way down to the lobby?
82) 11) dialog: It's a matter of a somewhat sensitive nature involving an
82) 15) dialog: individual exposing himself to women in the elevators--best discussed in person. If you'd just head on down...
84) 2) dialog: Hi, I'm Skippy from tech support. Is Henderson around? I'm supposed to install a firewall on his system-
84) 7) dialog: Oooooh - no can do. Upstairs breathing down my neck. They want security upgraded for the senior managers all of a sudden.
84) 9) dialog: Five minutes and I'll be out of your hair!
85) 9) dialog: According to this, the drive exists, Clay.
85) 14) dialog: Abso-tootly.
85) 18) dialog: No, somewhere off-site. It's gotta be a remote location, stand-alone. I'm checking their security logs-- wherever they've detailed the most guys is probably where it'll be...
85) 27) dialog: Whoa! Take it easy. You're the-
85) 30) dialog: Get me out of here, Clay... 80.
85) 39) dialog: I'm warning you, man, I'm a lethal weapon... Jensen turns on the big fellah.
85) 41) dialog: It was this secret government project. They did stuff to me. Spooky stuff. Anal stuff. Turned me into a dangerous Telekinetic. (wiggles index fingers) As the old saying goes - you don't start none... there won't be none.
85) 46) dialog: Bang.
85) 49) dialog: Boom.
85) 58) dialog: Face down, or I'll make your hearts stop beating with my mind.
85) 61) dialog: Thanks, Coug...
88) 3) dialog: Everything on Goliath - security, personnel history, the works. Aisha's brow furrows at this. Only we notice.
88) 8) dialog: Port of New York, baby. Total stand alone facility, and they're spending 30K a day on onsite security - you don't drop that kinda green to just guard oil. 83.
88) 13) dialog: Let me check, I--oh, shit...
88) 18) dialog: They've hired Par-Sec. A beat. This clearly means something bad to all of them.
88) 25) dialog: Paradigm Security Services. Ex- Special Forces.
88) 32) dialog: Our drive is being guarded by military trained, trigger repressed, blood thirsty, stone cold killers... Am I the only one who's thinking maybe we just chill out and go to Six Flags?
90) 0) text: Jensen and Pooch sitting at a table. Both with laptops. Jensen tapping his keys. Roque enters, carrying a coffee. Stops short, seeing the others. Surprised.
90) 10) dialog: You won't believe how detailed these files are. Every Goliath executive they've ever insured, their policies, their payouts-
90) 14) dialog: Yeah.
90) 18) dialog: 
90) 47) dialog: 
90) 51) dialog: We're going to need to drive fast...
92) 3) dialog: You think she's gonna kill him?
92) 7) dialog: Yeah, I think so too...
93) 20) dialog: Freeze! 88.
93) 23) dialog: She's his daughter, Clay! The guy in the basement's daughter and she's got a gun and it's pointed... (realizing; not happy) ...at my dick! Her gun is pointed at my dick!
93) 27) dialog: I know it makes no sense, but actually yes.
95) 9) dialog: My dick remains unshot!
95) 19) dialog: I think Cougar's got a plan! Coug, do you have a plan? (to the others) He's got a plan!
99) 11) dialog: Hey, fallen comrade here! Blood flowing out of his body...
99) 17) dialog: What's that for?
99) 76) dialog: Yeah, cause gettin' shot is awesome, I'm totally up for doing it again...
105) 3) dialog: And the crowd goes wild...
106) 3) dialog: What's the password?
106) 7) dialog: Drive should be in the Computer Room, two skylights over.
110) 0) text: Jensen, by a MIRRORED SKYLIGHT (so you can't see down into the room). Attaching a HARNESS to his waist...
110) 2) dialog: I'm above the computer room, maybe thirty seconds from the drive...
121) 3) dialog: Shouldn't have gone after the hat... 106.
121) 6) dialog: Can you stand?
121) 10) dialog: Oh, so we're Mr. Grumpy now? You're not the only one who's been shot recently, you know!
121) 19) dialog: Clay?
121) 25) dialog: There was no drive, Clay- 107.
121) 30) dialog: There was no drive and Roque's gone and Par-Sec's regrouping and Pooch could bleed out-
121) 53) dialog: Okay, excellent, very tribal--We need to go.
123) 31) dialog: Sounds less painful that way...
123) 36) dialog: Me and legless Pooch are on it!
123) 41) dialog: What, it's a cool name! It makes you sound like a pirate! (off his look) Fine, let's go kill Wade...
124) 0) text: Jensen enters, carrying a MACHINE GUN.
124) 2) dialog: Yoo-hoo! Wade! (a'la the Warriors) Come out and plaaaayyy-
124) 5) dialog: 
124) 9) dialog: I think I just found our way out of here...
125) 72) dialog: Not to rain on everyone's we killed all the bad guys parade, but we should probably get gone - legless Pooch has a Learjet all gassed up for us in the Hangar. (off Pooch's look) It's a cool name-
