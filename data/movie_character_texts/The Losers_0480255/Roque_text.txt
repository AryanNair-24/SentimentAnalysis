0) 3) dialog: Cards. The four take them. Lick the back, slap them to their foreheads -- two deuces (Jensen and Roque), a three (Pooch), and an eight (Cougar). Pitiful cards.
0) 7) dialog: Your mama had that feeling too.
0) 11) dialog: Raise you.
0) 16) dialog: Yup.
0) 22) dialog: Exactly how many knives do you have, anyway?
1) 11) dialog: 
1) 19) dialog: For that we had to put on a blindfold and turn around three times?
2) 3) dialog: I got eyes on Fadhil.
4) 18) dialog: Maintain position? Colonel-
4) 54) dialog: Then contact the plane directly-
4) 64) dialog: Five against a fortress, and we've got maybe six minutes before an airstrike sets the world on fire.
4) 68) dialog: So, I'll drive.
5) 8) dialog: 
8) 6) dialog: What kind of blast radius we looking at? Jensen, calculating on the computer tablet. Shows an animation mock-up to Roque - huge blast radius. To Pooch:
8) 8) dialog: 
12) 35) dialog: Relax, Pooch, we're not going to be court-martialed - if anything, we're going to die of thirst wandering the desert, right Colonel?
12) 43) dialog: 
13) 36) dialog: Ah, shit...
13) 63) dialog: Shut up.
13) 67) dialog: Shut up...
21) 5) dialog: 
21) 11) dialog: You placed the bet.
21) 15) dialog: Well, that was stupid of me, wasn't it?
21) 18) dialog: That makes, what, three in a row?
21) 22) dialog: You know where you're messing up? You're putting all our money on the dogs with the best odds.
21) 27) dialog: Never play a longshot, you're never gonna win.
21) 29) dialog: We're at a dogtrack at 10 a.m. - could this get any more sleazy?
21) 34) dialog: You're not drinking?
22) 5) dialog: Then what?
22) 10) dialog: I can't take much more of this.
22) 14) dialog: I'm serious. Grinding out lunch money on five dollar sports bets, wincing everytime some overly Aqua- netted cow stares at my face for more than two seconds-
22) 20) dialog: Due respect, you're nobody's Colonel anymore.
22) 24) dialog: Like the others? Least I still talk to them. You pushed them away. "Max this, Max that" - we never even saw the guy, Clay-
22) 28) dialog: 
22) 32) dialog: 
22) 34) dialog: No, it's a stellar plan - we can use this as our base of ops! (gestures to the
23) 3) dialog: I was there too. I remember. But he won. We lost.
34) 5) dialog: You sure you're thinking clear on this? (off Clay's look) I know you. When you slip, it's always cause of a woman.
34) 8) dialog: 
34) 13) dialog: Carla's husband wasn't the one who
34) 19) dialog: What about Emma?
34) 23) dialog: Because she put a bomb in your car.
34) 27) dialog: And now this chick, first time you meet her, burns down our hotel. Also, she kills people for a living. These are not good signs...
34) 32) dialog: You better be. Or we're done.
34) 44) dialog: How long you been back there?
34) 67) dialog: 
34) 84) dialog: 
34) 100) dialog: For now.
34) 105) dialog: Country turned her back on us, and God can screw. This one's for us.
44) 18) dialog: What about their ride?
44) 45) dialog: Shut up, Jensen.
44) 49) dialog: Stop talking or I'll break your neck for real.
49) 23) dialog: Which brings us to our next question...
49) 26) dialog: What's your angle in this?
49) 33) dialog: I'm gonna shoot her, Clay.
49) 37) dialog: Yes, I am.
49) 41) dialog: Right now.
49) 46) dialog: She's coming with us. And if anything feels like a set-up, I put a bullet in her skull.
49) 51) dialog: You're Muslim?
49) 56) dialog: I don't like this.
49) 64) dialog: What if it doesn't? What if we never get face to face with him. Are you gonna be able to live with that? Ever?
68) 41) dialog: Great. The super evil bad guy is in bed with the world's largest oil company. That's just fabulous.
68) 81) dialog: 
68) 134) dialog: What?
68) 149) dialog: Did you know?
68) 153) dialog: 
68) 159) dialog: 
69) 31) dialog: This is conspiracy theory bullshit-
70) 5) dialog: And do what - go after this non- existent hard drive?
70) 10) dialog: That's your plan?
70) 18) dialog: Why risk our lives again when we already have something to trade?
70) 23) dialog: I want to at least discuss it before signing up for another suicide mission on the say-so of some flunky-
70) 28) dialog: So you want to take down Goliath now? Then who? McDonald's? American Airlines? Microsoft?
70) 32) dialog: I want my life back! This is supposed to be us getting clear - not saving the world!
70) 35) dialog: 
70) 37) dialog: We're not the goddamn good guys anymore! I love you guys, but I had a life before this shit, and I sure as hell am not going to risk getting it back because you came down with a case of the Dudley Damn Do-Rights! 65.
70) 41) dialog: I will raise whatever the hell I want - you got a death wish because you got beat by a voice on a radio-
70) 44) dialog: I'm gonna cut your head off...
70) 56) dialog: She doesn't get a vote-
78) 3) dialog: Well, that's just great.
78) 19) dialog: Sorry I threatened to cut your head off.
88) 10) dialog: What are we up against?
90) 0) text: Jensen and Pooch sitting at a table. Both with laptops. Jensen tapping his keys. Roque enters, carrying a coffee. Stops short, seeing the others. Surprised.
90) 2) dialog: Thought you guys'd be back at the hotel.
90) 6) dialog: Me neither. Grabbed a coffee from the machine - you want one?
90) 12) dialog: Life insurance?
90) 16) dialog: What's the biggest payout? 85.
90) 21) dialog: Pretty much what we're gonna be risking.
90) 26) dialog: The hell you need a satellite for? Pooch shows him the screen of his computer - RECORDED VIDEO from earlier in the day. An OVERHEAD VIEW of a Playground - POOCH'S DAUGHTERS PLAYING. They both watch for a bit. The only sound, Jensen's typing. Then:
90) 30) dialog: Military neighborhood...
90) 35) dialog: 
90) 44) dialog: I hear you, man.
93) 40) dialog: Shit, she's got back-up!
95) 3) dialog: Go, go, go!
95) 12) dialog: Here they come...
99) 25) dialog: Pooch...
99) 36) dialog: So we just run again?
99) 42) dialog: There's something we can do.
99) 46) dialog: Three years is enough. If there's a drive at that port that we can use to get clear-
99) 50) dialog: So figure out a way around them; you're good at that shit, Clay!
99) 53) dialog: We run now, we're gonna be running forever. This is our one chance to get our lives back...
99) 56) dialog: Never play a longshot, you're never gonna win.
99) 67) dialog: Last thing they'll expect...
100) 10) dialog: I'm ready.
106) 11) dialog: You can't settle for stealing the drive, you gotta blow up Goliath's shit too.
111) 14) dialog: I think you should see this. Roque's got the doors of the container opened that he's looking in. Clay approaches...
113) 5) dialog: No. Not Aisha.
113) 8) dialog: You know, for a revenge driven conspiracy nut, you're pretty fucking gullible...
118) 8) dialog: After the truck. I got tired of waiting for you to save us, so I up and saved myself. Reached out like I said and cut a deal - I set this up, I go free.
118) 13) dialog: You gave me no choice. It was always gonna end like this, Clay. Us captured or dead. It was always a dead end. You made sure of it.
118) 18) dialog: Not bullshit. You were gonna keep planning missions and ways to hit Max until it got us all killed.
118) 22) dialog: Yes, Clay. Yes. Only difference with this situation is at least I get to walk away.
118) 26) dialog: Don't you get it yet? There is no drive. There never was...
118) 29) dialog: Fennel made it up to save himself. When I told Wade, he planted the info at Goliath to lead you here.
118) 32) dialog: You really thought there was a happy ending coming? Pooch was gonna get his family back, we were gonna get to be soldiers again? (leans down; softly) We lost the moment we went off mission. This is just the logical conclusion of that playing out. You didn't want to hear it.
118) 36) dialog: You just wanted your revenge. Your face-to-face with the big bad wolf. I'm sorry, buddy, but it's the way of the world...
118) 39) dialog: Guys like us don't beat guys like him.
118) 56) dialog: Wait.
118) 59) dialog: I'm sorry it had to end this way.
123) 5) dialog: Clay doesn't take risks. It's why I'm here and he's not.
123) 13) dialog: They were good guys.
123) 25) dialog: Declan, start the plane...
123) 47) dialog: 
123) 52) dialog: Fine, just get us in the air! He fires ANOTHER BURST from his weapon at the Vette! CLICK - his WEAPON DRY.
123) 54) dialog: I'm out!
125) 5) dialog: Gotta admit, I always wondered how this would play out.
125) 9) dialog: It's a distinct possibility...
125) 12) dialog: You don't have a knife?
125) 16) dialog: Bit of as longshot for you...
125) 24) dialog: Now I really am gonna cut your head off...
