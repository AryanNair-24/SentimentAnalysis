23) 39) dialog: No.
24) 3) dialog: 
24) 7) dialog: You lookin' to turn a "yes" into a "no" here?
25) 3) dialog: So what brings you to Florida?
25) 14) dialog: They have whole conventions devoted to air conditioners?
25) 21) dialog: Bet I would. Where were we?
25) 26) dialog: Saw me there did you?
25) 31) dialog: Didn't see me at the McDonald's though...
25) 34) dialog: I have a proposition for you...

25) 55) dialog: Max. I can help you. 27.
26) 5) dialog: It's not too tough if you know where to look. You guys aren't exactly subtle.
26) 10) dialog: Counted the number of teeth found in the safehouse debris in Karachi. Not nearly enough for five men.
26) 14) dialog: That you're alive? Just me.
26) 17) dialog: You want Max and I can tell you how to get him.
26) 22) dialog: Nice try, but I'm working alone here. If I wasn't, I wouldn't need your help. Ready for the important part?

26) 40) dialog: 
26) 49) dialog: Hey! (he turns back) You really think I look good in these jeans?
26) 53) dialog: Cargo's heroin. Max uses it to fund his off the books ops. And it comes straight from the poppy fields of the late Jamal al-Fadhil. (knowing full well) Oh... does that name mean something to you?
26) 56) dialog: He used you to kill Fadhil and take over his operation, that's right. What did you think you were doing there in the first place? Fighting for truth and justice?

26) 74) dialog: Operational capital, that's all. (holding out the check) You've been waiting three years for a shot at this guy. You're not gonna get another. You want Max, this is it. He takes it. She hands him some papers along with it.
26) 76) dialog: Intel on the shipment. You check it out, you check me out, you decide - are you in or not?
34) 46) dialog: Long enough.
34) 52) dialog: Really? You can't hang out with anyone just named "Phil"?
34) 58) dialog: I'd expect no less.
49) 7) dialog: (watching the chopper) Uh-huh...
49) 12) dialog: When I was a girl, I collected human ears. I had over three dozen pairs when a feral dog came into our camp one night and took them. The dog was good eating, though. A beat.
49) 17) dialog: Are small arms gonna be a problem?
49) 30) dialog: I'm giving you a chance to get even. That's all you need to know.
49) 49) dialog: Oh, completely. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time for prayers.
49) 53) dialog: You know, you are a sharp one--and don't let any of these other boys tell you different.

77) 22) dialog: Why were you alone when I found you?
77) 27) dialog: Sick of what? 73.
77) 31) dialog: And he hasn't told them he is alive?
77) 35) dialog: So Roque has no one.
77) 39) dialog: And you have...
77) 43) dialog: If you two really fought, he would kill you, I think.
77) 47) dialog: I'm almost sure of it.
77) 51) dialog: Because you care what happens to the others. You wouldn't put them at risk to save yourself.
77) 55) dialog: I know it is. Law of the jungle.
77) 59) dialog: Oh, yes we are...
88) 23) dialog: Who's Par-Sec?

121) 50) dialog: Wear it. Remember him. 108.
126) 35) dialog: I wanted to find and punish those responsible for my father's death. Max, his men, everyone.
126) 39) dialog: That and the cardio.
126) 45) dialog: I'm coming.
