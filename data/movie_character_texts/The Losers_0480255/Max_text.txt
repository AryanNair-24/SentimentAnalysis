31) 29) dialog: A "hit him in the face" nod, not a "throw him out the window" nod.
31) 33) dialog: At most--at most that was a "break his fingers" nod. (slams his fist) I mean Jesus, Wade, the man was scientific genius. Granted his weight signaled that he had certain impulse control issues, but that's no reason to throw his fat ass out a fifty story window.

36) 15) dialog: I think it's safe to say it works!
36) 18) dialog: Jeez, talk about hard to impress...
37) 5) dialog: Kinda... Sorta...
37) 8) dialog: You know the drill, they don't like to know how the sausages get made. What do you care?
37) 11) dialog: The money's coming from our Afghanistan operation. And what the Company doesn't know won't hurt them.
37) 16) dialog: We're gonna saving our country, Wade. The United States of America will benefit greatly from what we're doing.
37) 20) dialog: Jesus, fine - we're saving North America, does that make you happy? Just get it done.

75) 19) dialog: Change of plans. Kill them.
75) 23) dialog: Or fire them, whichever's easier.
75) 27) dialog: Fine, fine, I'm not a detail guy. What I need- wait. Did you give them intel on Clay's people?
75) 31) dialog: Aaaand we're back to killing them.
75) 36) dialog: Touchy, touchy. Jeez, what are you related to them?
75) 40) dialog: By blood?
75) 44) dialog: It's not what we're doing, it's what Clay is going to do for us...
