7) 4) dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen, I’ve traveled over half our state to get here this evening. I couldn't get away sooner because my new well was coming in at Coyote Hills and I had to see about it. That well is now flowing at two thousand barrels and it’s paying me an income of five thousand dollars a week. I have two others drilling and I have sixteen producing at Antelope. So — Ladies and Gentlemen — if I say I’m an oil man, you will agree. (beat) You have a great chance here — but bear in mind: you can loose it all if you’re not careful. Out of all men that beg for a chance to drill your lots, maybe one in twenty will be oil men; the rest will be speculators — men trying to get between you and the oil men — to get some of the money that ought by rights come to you. Even if you find one that has money, and means to drill, he’1ll maybe know nothing about drilling and he’1ll have to hire out the job on contract — and then you’re depending on a contractor that’s tryin’ to rush the job through — so he can get another contract just as quick as he can. This is way that this works. An OC VOICE INTERRUPTS, LOUDLY; Daniel holds his composu
7) 7) dialog: I do my own drilling and the men that work for me, work for me and they are men I know. I make it my business to be there and see to their work. I don’t lose my tools in the hole and spend months fishing for them; I don’t botch the cementing off and let water in the hole and ruin the whole lease. REVEAL, AT THAT MOMENT, young H.W. (age 7) He is standing Daniel and looking at the group OC. Daniel and H.W.;
7) 8) dialog: I'm fixed like no other company in this field and that’s because my Coyote Hills well has just come in — I have a string of tools all ready to put to work..I can load a rig onto trucks and have them here in a week. I have business connections so I can get the lumber for the derrick — such things go by friendship in a rush like this. And this is why I can guarantee to start drilling and put up the cash to back my word. I assure you, whatever the others promise to do, when it comes to the showdown, they won't be there...
7) 27) dialog: It’s not up to me to say how you’re going to divide the royalty. But let me say this; whatever you give up so you can get together — it will be smart compared to what you may loose by delay. The crooks and the gamblers are near and the wolf is scratching the door. Ladies and Gentlemen, take it from me as an oil man — humbly — there aren’t going to be many gushers here at Signal Hill. A field plays out very quick. In two or three years, these wells will be dry — even this discovery well that’s gushing down the road and has everyone so crazy. So my suggestion, with respect, is take a smaller share of royalty and we will see that it’s a small share of a bigger royalty. That, ladies and gentleman, is what I had to say. HOLD ON THE ROOM. Everyone has taken this in, then: THE R

7) 41) dialog: Mr. Bankside, I’m not going to waste your time and I’d like it if you didn’t waste mine. If you want to sign with me we can have a well drilling within ten days. Your lot is further North from the discovery well up here so it means we will probably have to dig deeper. If there's as much oil up here as I think there is, it will be harder to reach but once we find it we can take it right out. But we have to act quickly because very soon these grounds will dry up. I need you to know what you want to do. Because of the distance from the discovery well I’1l pay you a smaller royalty than you’d get down there — but I'll give you a thousand dollar bonus on your lot.
7) 43) dialog: A sixth — now that’s standard. And a guarantee to start drilling within ten days — which isn’t.
