I’ve screwed up a lot of things. But I screwed them up. Not you. She looks up at Rainy. AUDREY (CONT’D) It's true. I got pregnant in college. I dropped out because I couldn't afford it. Nostalgia washes over her face. AUDREY (CONT’D) I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life anyway. Motherhood seemed as good a purpose as any. Audrey's eyes meet with Cheyenne’s. AUDREY (CONT’D) It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. It was tough and I barely scraped by. I thought so many times I’d never make it. But I swear, I never once regretted it. 66.

I was smart enough to get a scholarship and dumb enough to think this guy cared about me. Her eyes turn glassy. Like she can see it all again. AUDREY (CONT’D) I wanted to impress him. I was nervous and I drank too much. The music was so loud. There were so many people. It was hot and stuffy. I got nauseous, so I asked him where the bathroom was. I remember tripping on the stairs. He caught me and we laughed at how tipsy I was. I trusted him. (getting more immersed) When he pushed me on the bed, I didn’t even know where I was at first. The room was spinning. When I told him to stop, he said it was my idea. I remember his weight. The pressure. I couldn’t move. I could barely breathe. I felt like I was in a coffin. But he wouldn’t stop. She pops back to the present, glances around. AUDREY (CONT’D) I turned him in to the president. It was his word against mine and he said it was consensual. When I wouldn’t let it go, I was expelled. She pauses, staring into empty space. AUDREY (CONT’D) I just left. I just gave up. I thought my life was over. Tears well in Audrey’s eyes as they fix on Cheyenne.

Then one day I realized... she saved my life. Audrey turns sadly to Cheyenne. This is the big one. It’s scary but it’s time to confess the whole story. AUDREY (CONT’D) Thomas, the man you know as your father, was my first husband. The truth is, the reason he doesn’t pay child support is because he doesn’t have to. After we divorced, he asked if he could still see you and I said yes. He helped us for a while but after he remarried, he... he quit. Finally, the floodgates give way and Audrey breaks down. AUDREY (CONT’D) He’s a good man. And I am so sorry I lied to you. Your real father doesn’t want anything to do with you. I was too scared to tell you the truth. Because I’m a coward. Cheyenne’s eyes reach out with the kind of forgiveness on child can offer so quickly.
