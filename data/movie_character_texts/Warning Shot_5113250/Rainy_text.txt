15) 13) dialog: Well, suit yourself. Rainy takes another big draw.
15) 15) dialog: If you want it back, you could just ask. You don’t have to get personal. Jawari laughs, taking the joint. Rainy stares at Audrey w that sinister tinge blooming in his eyes again.

15) 36) dialog: I want you to ask... for... it.
15) 38) dialog: You can. And you will.
15) 40) dialog: No, fuck that. You can say it with Cheyenne here. She’s too young to understand anyway. 38.
15) 42) dialog: Okay, then. He turns a chair facing the doorway to the next room. Pul Audrey off the couch and sits her in the chair. Grabs som rope and ties her ankles to the chair legs.
15) 43) dialog: Then you can sit here and see what happens next.
15) 45) dialog: Maybe Cheyenne will ask for it. He pulls Cheyenne off the couch. She breaks into tears, scared to death, even though she doesn’t understand what’ happening. Audrey is horrified.
15) 47) dialog: Come on, Cheyenne, let’s leave Audrey to think about things.
15) 49) dialog: Well, if you’re gonna beg... He pushes Cheyenne down on the couch. Loosens the binds around Audrey’s ankles.
15) 50) dialog: I knew my charm would wear you down . Audrey's eyes meet Cheyenne’s. The girl is traumatized.

16) 3) dialog: Do you know what country you're in? David’s smile fades.
16) 5) dialog: It's a simple question, David. Do you know... what country... that you are in? David digests, unsettled by the awkwardness.
16) 7) dialog: That's right. This is America.
16) 9) dialog: Did you see that church on the corner down there?
16) 11) dialog: Well, it’s one of about a million on damn near every corner in the country. Do you really think you’re gonna run into someone who’s never heard of Jesus fuckin’ Christ. David just stares speechless. 4l.
16) 12) dialog: I’1l tell you where you need to go. You need to go to one of those remote areas of Africa, with all those crazy tribes that worship tigers and shit. That’s where you'll find people who’ve never heard of Jesus. David shakes his head, trying to focus.
16) 14) dialog: Wanna know why Christians don’t go to places like that to proselytize? Because you'll get a spear in your ass, that’s why. They’1ll make a necklace out of your fucking head.
16) 17) dialog: You saw something, didn’t you? David turns around.
16) 19) dialog: Don’t act stupid. You saw something, didn’t you?
16) 21) dialog: That’s why I hate you people. You'll lie like the devil the second it suits you. David turns, sees the rifle. Runs away. Rainy chases.
16) 22) dialog: Oh, now you’re gonna run away like a little pussy. Rainy gets close enough, RAPS David on the head. David hi the ground, senses reeling.
16) 23) dialog: I hate liars, David.
17) 0) text: Rainy shoves David, hands bound behind him, to the floor. This is the living room with the large open space.

17) 2) dialog: Audrey here did something to tip you off. We hear Audrey moan as Rainy grabs her. FOOTSTEPS approac
17) 3) dialog: Then you acted like you were leaving when you were really going for help. Rainy tugs Audrey into the room, shoves her to the floor.
17) 4) dialog: Then I asked you if you saw something and you lied.
17) 8) dialog: This isn’t about me not answering the door. This is about you lying and not being able to admit it.
17) 10) dialog: Well, now, that’s not a sincere admission, now is it, David?
17) 12) dialog: Yeah, there’s a lot of that going around. He stands, grabs the strap to his rifle to hold it secure
17) 13) dialog: I just want you... He kicks David in the stomach. David draws in, groaning.
17) 14) dialog: +.. to admit... Rainy kicks him again. And again. And again. While Audrey screams for him to stop.

17) 17) dialog: I just want a little sincerity, David. Is that too much to ask?
17) 22) dialog: Did you hear that, Audrey? Mr. Christian was just going to leave you here to rot. It’s okay, sweetheart. You still have me. Rainy pulls David up to his knees.
17) 23) dialog: I bet you wish that prayer bullshit really worked right about now, don’t you?
17) 26) dialog: Come on, Zulu. You’re not mad at me over that little bump on the head, are you? I was just trying to get a little time alone with my lady. Jawari steps closer, still aiming the gun. Notices David.
17) 28) dialog: That's my new friend, David. He likes to preach the gospel when he isn’t leaving women and children behind to save himself.
19) 12) dialog: Zulu? Jawari looks up, not the slightest bit scared.
19) 14) dialog: First off, I told you, it’s a goddamn rifle. He lowers the rifle, focused on a rant now.
19) 15) dialog: A rifle! Don’t you know the fuckin’ difference! He holds the rifle up by the barrel.
19) 16) dialog: A rifle has a goddamn rifled bore! It causes the bullet to come out spinning! Like a football! A gun has a smooth bore so its accuracy is shit! He aims the rifle at Jawari. 53.
19) 17) dialog: Secondly, I thought you knew me better. What makes you think I won’t shoot your ass dead? Jawari picks the MAGAZINE for the rifle off the table, ho it up for Rainy to see.
19) 19) dialog: Son of a bitch.
19) 21) dialog: Ah shit, I was just messin’ with you. I wasn’t gonna shoot you. Jawari grabs his gun, points it at Rainy.
19) 23) dialog: Can’t I even sit at the table?
19) 25) dialog: Fine. I’1l sit on the couch with Audrey.
19) 27) dialog: Fine. I wanted the recliner anyway.
19) 29) dialog: Me? I was just having a little fun. Like the old days. Rape, pillage, burn and all that. Rainy glances at the small wood-burning stove next to him There are several thin logs on top and a couple of larger ones at the base. Rainy pulls out his balisong.
19) 30) dialog: Do you mind if I whittle while we wait? He grabs a thin log. Slings the knife open by spinning it gracefully around his fingers.
19) 32) dialog: I do. That’s why I don’t mind cutting them up. Jawari sighs. Rainy idly whittles.
19) 33) dialog: I’‘ll carve you a little tiki statue. Jawari rolls his eyes. A few moments of silence go by.
19) 34) dialog: Hey, Audrey? Want me to make you something? Audrey pauses, staring, not sure what to say. Turns away.
19) 36) dialog: I don’t think Jawari appreciates my efforts. Besides, you’re much prettier than Jawari.
19) 38) dialog: Oh, Audrey, that’s cold. That hurt my feelings.
19) 40) dialog: That's not true. I’m a sensitive guy. Really. He’s met with cold silence.
19) 41) dialog: Let me ask you something. If I was just some guy you met. And you didn’t know anything about me. Would you even talk to me? She turns her face toward him, still not answering.
19) 42) dialog: If I just walked up to you somewhere and you didn’t know me. If we talked, just about simple things. And I didn’t do anything to creep you out. What would you think of me? Audrey vacillates, uncertain, then softly answers.
19) 44) dialog: I fool myself sometimes. Audrey raises her chin, strong with a bit of defiance.
19) 47) dialog: Hey, fuck you, Zulu. Jawari just laughs more. Starts rolling a joint. Rainy fi to compose himself. When he calms down enough, it’s like another personality washes over him. He chuckles.
19) 48) dialog: That’s pretty good, Audrey. You really got me. That’s funny. He starts whittling again.
19) 49) dialog: You know what I’m gonna make you, Audrey? A little giraffe. You like giraffes, don’t you? Everyone likes giraffes. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t like giraffes.
19) 51) dialog: I was in the woods for weeks. All those trees became like prison bars. Who’s ever had an experience like that with giraffes? (to Audrey) Do you like giraffes, Audrey?
19) 54) dialog: Hey, let me have a hit off that. Jawari digs out a lighter.
19) 56) dialog: What about you, shy one? Do you like giraffes? Cheyenne nods.
19) 57) dialog: You know, a lot of people think giraffes are weak because they got those long necks. But did you know a giraffe could kick a lion’s head off? Jawari laughs.
19) 59) dialog: They're bigger than you think.
19) 61) dialog: Their legs can get taller than a man. Their hindquarters can get bigger around than my waist. Jawari keeps laughing as he blows smoke.
19) 63) dialog: I can’t believe you're going to smoke that all by yourself.
19) 65) dialog: I paid for the beer.
19) 67) dialog: How much you want for a joint? Rainy pulls out his (Notta’s) wallet. Slips out two dolla

19) 70) dialog: How much you want? Jawari starts rolling a joint.
19) 72) dialog: So what church do you belong to? I know you’re not Mormon. They travel in pairs. He glances at Jawari. They both laugh. David speaks softl
19) 74) dialog: What is that, Jehovah’s Witnesses?
19) 76) dialog: What do they think about you being a homo? David looks up, stunned silent.
19) 77) dialog: That’s what I thought. You know that’s a sin according to your bible, right? David forces a response.
19) 79) dialog: Just like you didn’t see Audrey? David averts his eyes, caught out.
19) 80) dialog: I bet you spent your whole life trying to get away from it. I bet you try and pray it away every day. David insists.
19) 82) dialog: It’s in the eyes.
19) 84) dialog: Yes, you can. He leans a little closer to David, provocatively.
19) 85) dialog: They promised you inner peace, but you didn’t get shit, did you? Door to door in the hot sun for Jesus, and all you get in return is hi and bye on Sunday. Put your money in the plate and see you next week.
19) 90) dialog: You ever feel the Holy Spirit in you?
19) 92) dialog: Ever speak in tongues? Allah ballah ballah... Jawari bursts out laughing. Tosses the joint to Rainy.
19) 95) dialog: Ah. This is some fine green, my friend. Not nary a crack or a pop of stem nor seed. 60. He tosses the lighter back. Jawari catches it.
19) 97) dialog: You need to borrow my knife? Jawari pulls a switchblade from his pocket. Pushes a butt forward... FLICK. A blade springs out. Jawari grins.
19) 99) dialog: A balisong is better than a switchblade.
19) 101) dialog: Fan knives are more reliable.
19) 103) dialog: You can’t carve a giraffe with a switchblade. The blade’s too flimsy. Audrey interrupts...
19) 105) dialog: You can’t get high off secondhand pot smoke. If you could, we’d all be high off Jawari. BING. Jawari retracts the blade of his knife.
19) 107) dialog: I’1l tell you what, Audrey. I’11 put out the joint if you’1l tell me about yourself. Audrey looks at Rainy, reluctant to agree.
19) 109) dialog: What do you do for a living?
19) 111) dialog: After you answer some questions.
19) 113) dialog: Oh, I don’t know. Let’s say, five.
19) 115) dialog: Okay, then. Four more. Were you ever a cheerleader? Audrey is caught off guard.
19) 117) dialog: I’m asking the questions.
19) 119) dialog: Were you popular in high school?
19) 121) dialog: No. No, see, it’s not. Whether or not you were popular in high school will tell me virtually everything about you.
19) 123) dialog: Because high school is where people are shaped for the rest of their lives. What you were then versus what you are now tells me everything. Audrey muses over those words a moment.
19) 125) dialog: Yes, you do. People know whether or not they were popular in high school. Audrey pauses, hesitant to answer.
19) 127) dialog: I knew there was something about you. And now you’re a waitress. See, that tells me a lot. Did you go to college? 63. Audrey answers with an air of sadness.
19) 129) dialog: Look how much we’ve learned in just four questions. You were valedictorian. You dropped out of college and became a waitress. Rainy leans forward with a telling smirk.
19) 130) dialog: And don't think I didn’t notice the wording. You “had to” drop out. Not “I dropped out.” But “had to.”
19) 132) dialog: Not lots of valedictorians.
19) 134) dialog: A valedictorian who can’t get a scholarship?
19) 136) dialog: No. My final question is... He ponders. His eyes rest on... Cheyenne.

19) 197) dialog: That's what I’m talkin’ about. 71. Jawari shoves Rainy away. Grabs his switchblade and start push the button. Rainy puts his hand over it... BING. The spring releases but the blade doesn’t emerge.

19) 209) dialog: Thanks for pointing that out, David. BANG! He shoots Jawari in the back. The hostages avert th eyes.

19) 212) dialog: What you mean is to keep yourself alive. Even at the expense of poor Audrey and Cheyenne here. He aims the rifle at David.
19) 213) dialog: So I‘1l tell you what I want you to do. I want you to pick someone. Whoever you pick gets killed and the other two can live. Which one’s it gonna be, David? David fights to keep composed. Sweat beads on his forehea
