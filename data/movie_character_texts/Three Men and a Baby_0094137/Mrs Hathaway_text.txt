97) 1) dialog: Good afternoon. I'm Mathilda Bretsaws, from The Second Mommy agency.
98) 3) dialog: (tense, but still calm)
98) 6) dialog: Absolutely, sir. A second mommy is a second mommy.
98) 8) dialog: Well, I expect you to show me to my quarters.
98) 10) dialog: Bretsaws.
100) 1) dialog: ... And as for screwing, I have all I need at home, thank you very much. With a few days off every month, I'm sure I'll be fine. The only thing I'm interested in is the care of the child and I can tell she needs some.
100) 4) dialog: Shouldn't I be discussing all this with the father?
100) 6) dialog: Bretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws.
100) 8) dialog: Very well. I won't discuss it any further with you. Will you please show me where the kitchen and the bathroom are?
100) 10) dialog: So I can make you a list of the things we need.
100) 12) dialog: No shopping or laundry or housekeeping. I am a professional nanny.
100) 14) dialog: Do you have a sufficient amount of fruit and vegetables for the child?
100) 17) dialog: That's not enough, sir. From the age of three months children should be started on a normal, varied diet.
100) 19) dialog: (mockingly) Oh, really? And how would you know?
100) 21) dialog: Bretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws.
100) 23) dialog: Depends, if it was a continuing problem, I might recommend a mild sedative...
100) 25) dialog: Fine. Anything you     say, sir. Let me just remind    you that I have my diploma and that    medicine is a serious matter.
100) 27) dialog: No, I don't. We must listen to different music. Personally I'm very fond of opera.
100) 30) dialog: The name's Bretsaws. I am blessed with infinite patience when it comes to children, sir, but I'm not qualified to deal with lunatics. Goodbye and good luck! Mrs. Bretsaws grabs her suitcase and exits, dignified and stiff as a broom, slamming the door behind her.
