3) 2) text: This is no line and I'm not trying to get you into bed. This is something completely different. This is 'love at first sight.' Oh, I'm so happy... Let me go get you a glass of champagne. I'll be right back. Jack gets up and goes over to the buffet. As soon as he's out of the girl's line of sight, he starts running toward the other end of the apartment. On the way he passes MICHAEL, who's deeply engrossed in a vehement conversation about modern art with a girl called SOPHIA. They're fighting like cats and dogs but seem to be enjoy- ing it.
3) 4) dialog: It goes back to prehistoric man. They had comic strips on their walls, for God's sake.
3) 7) dialog: (very interested)

Paul is wandering among the guests, trying to find Jack, he sees PETER who is talking with another young woman, NICOLE. Peter is nodding, idly looking around, com- pletely uninterested in the conversation.
3) 63) dialog: All's fair, old buddy... Jack watches a moment, then breaks into a wide smile.
4) 0) text: The guests are leaving. Commotion in the hall, people are saying goodbye to Peter and Michael. Natalie is about to walk out.
4) 10) dialog: So you struck out again with Natalie, huh? That Carl is a real smooth operator.
4) 12) dialog: Well, I didn't do so well either -- I blew it with Rosalie. I don't even know how...
4) 14) dialog: That beauty I managed to swipe
4) 17) dialog: How could you know that?
4) 19) dialog: That's not true. It's just that Sophia drives me crazy. She knows all the right buttons to push to make me mad.
4) 22) dialog: (still in the living room, shouting to Peter)

5) 7) dialog: Yeah, but he was with Christie at the beginning of the evening -- after that he was with Rosalie and then with Clementine. And since I stole Rosalie away from him... Are you following this?

5) 18) dialog: Well, things were going great until...
5) 20) dialog: How did you know?
5) 22) dialog: Well, I don't give a damn anyway, I have 24 drawings to hand in to my editor three days from now and I gotta work all night anyway... So it was all for the best. But you better not leave that Maxine's phone number lying around because when I'm done...
10) 0) text: Peter, dressed in casual clothes, knocks on the door of Michael's room, and peeks in. Michael is asleep fully clothed on his bed. His drawing table is strewn with papers, overflowing ashtrays and empty coffee cups. The lamp is still on.

10) 5) dialog: A.M. or P.M.?
10) 7) dialog: Up 'n' at 'em yourself, asshole -- I just went to bed.
10) 10) dialog: Nah, I didn't get anywhere.
10) 12) dialog: Six, six! He buries his head under the pillow.
11) 2) text: You gotta be kidding! Abruptly he turns and races back to Michael's room.
11) 4) dialog: (still groggy)
11) 8) dialog: What is it?
11) 10) dialog: It's a basket with a baby in it.
11) 13) dialog: What are we going to do with it?
11) 15) dialog: But it says she went to Europe.
11) 17) dialog: Whose phone number?
11) 19) dialog: Why the hell would I have her number? I've never even heard of this chick!
11) 21) dialog: No way. If I had to keep track of all Jack's girlfriends, I'd have to be a full-time secretary.
11) 23) dialog: Hey, look, she's waking up... Hey, look, she's crying...
11) 25) dialog: 
11) 28) dialog: Maybe she's hungry?
11) 30) dialog: Feed her, I guess...
11) 32) dialog: Soft stuff... I guess.
11) 34) dialog: Really?   Jack said that?
11) 36) dialog: Oh, so he told you about this?
11) 38) dialog: (very angrily) Boy, he's got a helluva nerve!
11) 40) dialog: (brilliant idea) Let's call Jack's mother!
11) 43) dialog: Well, just to ask her advice...
11) 45) dialog: But this is an emergency!
11) 47) dialog: Maybe I should call my mother...
11) 49) dialog: ... never for more than one night at a time!
11) 51) dialog: Where are you going?!
11) 53) dialog: What am I supposed to do while you're gone?
11) 56) dialog: (panic-stricken)
13) 0) text: Michael is still in the hall holding Mary very clumsily in his arms. He is anxious. He realizes she's soaked. This disgusts him. He holds her at arm's length; she squirms. He goes and gets a towel from the bathroom, spreads it out on the living room couch and lays the baby down on it. MARY SCREAMS -- she much prefers Michael's arms to the couch. A panicky Michael picks her up again, grumbling.
13) 1) dialog: Okay, okay, don't cry like that... I'll hold you, I'll hold you. He tries rather unsuccessfully to wrap the towel around the child. Obviously Michael is very put off by the smell coming from Mary.
15) 0) text: MARY is SCREAMING in Michael's arms as he walks her up and down the whole apartment. Now there are three towels wrapped around her. Michael is exasperated. He angrily sings her a lullaby.
15) 1) dialog: Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top...
15) 2) dialog: Stop crying now; c'mon, stop... quit it, will you?... When the wind blows, the cradle will rock... What is that jerk doing? Milking the cows or something?... When the bough breaks the cradle will fall... MARY only SCREAMS LOUDER.
17) 0) text: Michael is rapidly    pacing up and down the apartment, vigorously rocking    Mary. As soon as he sits down anywhere to rest,    MARY SCREAMS, so Michael pops back up and begins the    marathon all over again.
17) 1) dialog: Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb, if that jerk isn't back in three seconds I swear I'll throw her down the garbage chute... Mary had a little lamb, little lamb... The DOORBELL RINGS.
17) 2) dialog: Well, it's about goddamn time! He hurries towards the door, grabs the knob and throws it open.
17) 3) dialog: Where the hell have you been? He stops. Before him stands the apartment MANAGER, Mrs. Razzolini, a squat little woman with a moustache.
17) 4) dialog: Oh -- Hi, Mrs. Razzolini!
17) 7) dialog: No, it's not me, I mean she's not mine...
17) 9) dialog: No, no, it's Jack's, I mean it's not Jack's, it's... someone loaned it to us, I mean someone...
17) 11) dialog: Mary.
17) 13) dialog: Yeah, well, I have to put her to bed now.
17) 15) dialog: She's... she's not here.   She'll be back soon. Michael starts to close the door.    She pushes it back open and holds out the package.
17) 17) dialog: Well, like, y'see... she doesn't like to be held by strangers... The apartment Manager has already given Michael the package and grabbed Mary. She covers her with kisses. Mary smiles. Michael absent-mindedly looks at the package.
17) 20) dialog: Oh no, don't worry, I'm used to it. (faking a smile)
17) 23) dialog: What a leech! And that other idiot isn't back yet! He throws the package onto an armchair in the hall.
17) 24) dialog: So you love to be held by strangers, do you?
19) 0) text: Peter comes in with bags in his arms. Michael, holding the baby, dashes toward him, extremely pissed off.
19) 1) dialog: What the hell were you doing? You've been gone for hours! This damn kid's been crying the whole time. I've got a lot better things to do with my time! You're a real pain in the ass!
19) 4) dialog: Well, what the hell took   you so long? What'd you do, go    out for breakfast or something?    I didn't even have time for a cup   of coffee, for chrissakes.
19) 6) dialog: Okay, well, here -- take the kid, I've got work to do.
19) 8) dialog: 'Cause, it's your problem.    You found this kid.
19) 11) dialog: Jesus, there she goes again!      We gotta feed her something.
19) 13) dialog: Why?
19) 15) dialog: Do you look on top or bottom?
19) 17) dialog: Try feeling with your finger. Peter slides his finger over Mary's gums.
19) 20) dialog: She's soaking wet -- did you buy any diapers?
19) 22) dialog: 
20) 0) text: Michael rushes in and stops short in front of the moun- tains of diaper boxes that he starts examining in bewil- derment. Finally, he approaches the Store Clerk.
20) 1) dialog: Excuse me, miss, could you tell me which diapers are the most absorbent?
20) 3) dialog: Yeah, but which are better:    20-35 pounds or 12-24 pounds?
20) 6) dialog: Oh right, how much she weighs...
20) 8) text: You wouldn't happen to have a friend who came in here a little while ago, would you? Michael grabs just any box of diapers.
20) 9) dialog: I have no idea what you're talking about! He's no friend of mine. Michael takes off very, very quickly.
22) 0) text: Peter and Michael have laid Mary down on the couch, taking care to place several towels between her bottom and the immaculate velvet. Mary is squirming, laughing, feeling great. They have already gone through half a box of cotton in their attempts to clean up the crap. But it's still all over, on their hands, on the baby's feet and legs, on the towels, etc.
22) 2) dialog: I can't hold her. This kid's out of control here!
22) 5) dialog: Then get the cotton yourself if you don't want me to let go of her! Peter grabs a huge wad of cotton.
22) 7) dialog: But the couch'll get dirty!
22) 9) dialog: How 'bout after-shave?
22) 11) dialog: Okay, let's just put the diaper
22) 15) dialog: How am I supposed to know...? Peter tries to slide the diaper under Mary's backside but she squirms and kicks it off with her feet.
22) 18) dialog: I don't think they're too big -- They're ultra-absorbent. That's all. The more absorbent the better. Peter has more or less managed to adjust the diaper.
22) 20) dialog: My arms are getting tired.
22) 24) dialog: It's not working... What about laying her down?
22) 27) dialog: (taking another diaper)

41) 5) dialog: So what! If you leave me alone with this kid, I swear I'll pack up and be outta here by morning.

52) 0) text: Michael is giving her night feeding. Mary is falling asleep in his arms; the nipple falls out of her mouth, which goes on sucking anyway. Michael is falling asleep, too, his head lolling over to one side.
53) 2) dialog: He didn't say what time?
53) 4) dialog: Terrific! -- We could rot here till eight o'clock tonight.

55) 0) text: Peter and Michael are still sitting on the living room couches. The DOORBELL RINGS. Michael springs up and runs to open the door. Peter follows him. On the    doorstep stand the TWO PUNKS. One of them is short    and speaks with a heavy Brooklyn accent. The other,    tall, thin and creepy-looking, stands behind hi buddy    and doesn't speak.
55) 2) dialog: Yes, he does.
55) 9) dialog: (sarcastically)
55) 12) dialog: She could have at least given us a phone number or the name of someone to contact...
55) 14) dialog: Sure they told us! So what? That doesn't make the last four days any less hellish than they were!
55) 18) dialog: About an hour after her bottle, she starts yawning. Put her to bed right away or it's pure hell for the next three hours, at least that's what we've noticed. Peter has returned with the basket. The Punks look at the baby, their eyes wide with disbelief.
55) 28) dialog: You take it all, man!    It's a package deal!
55) 30) dialog: How do I know? You take it where they told you to take it.
55) 32) dialog: Yeah, whatever you want to call it.
55) 35) dialog: You bet that's the plan! We're not keeping her one more second.
55) 41) text: Oh shit, I don't have it on me... But I'll call you. Okay, so long! PETER &amp; MICHAEL
55) 42) text: So long! The elevator has arrived.    The Punks quickly slip insid it with the basket. Michael closes the door. Peter plops down in the armchair by the front door.
55) 44) dialog: You said it! Now maybe I can get some work done. He disappears in the direction of his room. Peter is sitting    on something hard. He pulls it out fr under him, it's    a package. He looks at it, casually reading: "Care     of Jack Collins." He tosses it to the side. Suddenly,     it dawns on him. He leaps up, grabs the package and    runs into Michael's room.
56) 3) dialog: Well, a package, I guess.
56) 5) dialog: Yeah, why? Peter raises his voice, exasperated by Michael's calm attitude.
56) 7) dialog: Will you quit shouting!
56) 9) text: When did this fucking package fucking arrive, Michael?
56) 10) dialog: I don't know... Oh yeah, Sunday -- Mrs. Razzolini brought it up...

56) 14) dialog: Hey, asshole yourself!... Oh shit! Peter nods and begins to bark orders.
58) 4) dialog: Hey, what's happening? What were those cops doing... Peter shuts him up, grabs him roughly under the arm and leads him into his room, closing the door behind them. Peter speaks softly but he's totally freaking out, he can hardly breathe.
58) 6) dialog: Yeah?   What?
58) 8) dialog: Tell me what...
58) 11) dialog: But did the cops see the dope?
58) 13) dialog: Shit!
58) 16) dialog: Don't worry. He starts down the fire escape, then stops and turns back
58) 17) dialog: Oh, by the way, I put some water up to boil for her bottle. Michael disappears. Peter picks up Mary, grabs his  wal- let and leaves the room. When he gets to the hall,  he discovers that Cop #1 has joined Cop #2, to whom he is whispering something. Peter holds his license out  for them to see.
59) 0) text: Michael is buying a pair of scissors, glue and a roll of Scotch tape. Then he buys a box of large diapers -- he chooses the ones that come in a box. Michael leaves the supermarket, whistling.
60) 0) text: Michael is sitting on a bench facing the grass, with his back to us, he seems quite busy. As we CLOSE IN, we discover that he has opened the box of diapers and that he's holding one of them; its plastic has been carefully cut out with scissors. Casually, glancing right and left, he takes the individ- ual packets of white powder out of his pocket and shoves them into a little plastic bag from the supermarket. Then he carefully tapes the bag so it's well-sealed and flattened out, and he inserts it into the diaper, be- tween the plastic and the absorbent fabric. Next, the diaper is taped up, folded back up and put back in the box, neatly packed between the other ones. Michael closes the box again and glues it together so it looks as if it's never been opened. He throws all the other stuff away in a trash can and grabs hold of his brand-new box of diapers. He walks away.
61) 0) text: Michael comes into the living room with his box of diapers and a bag of groceries. In addition to the two cops there are now THREE NARCOTIC AGENTS who are interrogating Peter. He is holding Mary. The basket is on an armchair.
61) 1) dialog: Hello, Officers... What's going on?
61) 3) dialog: Did you give her the 5:30 bottle?
61) 6) dialog: Did you change her?
61) 8) dialog: Okay, I'll do it. Michael puts down his bag of groceries, takes Mary from Peter and disappears with the box of diapers. In his room, he lays Mary down on his bed and starts undressing her.
63) 0) text: Mary is lying on Michael's bed. He has just finished putting a regular diaper on her. Then Michael looks for the tampered-with diaper in the box. He finds it, checks that it is well-sealed, and places it under Mary's bottom. Just then Agent #3 appears in the doorway. Michael calmly finishes putting the dope-filled diaper on the baby on top of the other one. MARY is COOING. Every- thing appears normal. However, a trained eye might be very surprised by the enormous thickness of the diaper covering the young lady's backside. But a narcotics agent is not necessarily the most qualified person to notice something odd like this. Agent #3 silently observes Michael, who gives him a big smile as he slips on Mary's pajama bottoms. Michael picks Mary up and for the first time talks to her in the kind of silly babytalk used by adoring parents.
63) 2) dialog: Okey-dokey, honeybunch, it's time to go beddy-bye now... We're gonna take a nice long nappy-wappy... He goes back to the living room, followed by Agent #3. Agent #1 is in the process of showing Peter a photograph.
63) 7) dialog: So! Can I get you something to drink? Agent #1 totally ignores him.
63) 12) dialog: Yeah, Peter and I just love kids!
63) 15) dialog: Come back anytime, gentlemen. You're always welcome here. We have no particular plans to leave New York in the near future, so don't worry about us now. 'Bye now. Once the cops are gone, Michael races back to the living room. Peter has collapsed into his armchair.
63) 17) dialog: (also speaking in a low tone)
63) 21) dialog: This way it's close at hand!
63) 23) dialog: Relax, will you.
63) 24) dialog: I diapered the dope on her right in front of the cop and he never noticed a thing!
63) 27) dialog: Wait a minute. You're not gonna stick me with this kid! Tell them you need a maternity leave, tell them anything, but we've got to go 50-50 on this!
64) 0) text: Hidden within a parked car, three men are keeping a close watch on the entrance to Peter, Michael and Jack's build- ing. The two uniformed cops emerge, get in their car, and pull away.
65) 5) text: ... Goddammit, Jerry, of course winning the competition is important to me! The firm's my whole life if you must know. No, no, please -- don't send anyone over here... Don't you come either. No, Jerry... Okay, listen, I'll be there in a half-hour, but I can't stay long. No! Don't come here! I'll be right over. He hangs up.   Michael enters the room, with his coat on.
65) 6) dialog: 
65) 9) dialog: Yeah, but don't worry about it, I'll be back before it's time for her next bottle. She's asleep now.
65) 11) dialog: Well, call him back. Tell him you'll come later.
65) 13) dialog: You're crazy. Oxman is leaving in an hour. If I don't meet him before then, I blow my 15,000 dollar contract.
65) 15) dialog: Look, maybe we could pawn her off on Mrs. Razzolini, just for a couple of hours -- she's crazy about her!
66) 0) text: Peter and Michael get out of the elevator on Mrs. Razzolini's floor. They each are holding one of the handles on the basket. They are walking quickly. Suddenly Michael stops Peter.
66) 2) dialog: Wait -- I hear someone... I'll go see... Peter waits with the basket.   Michael tiptoes to the corner of the corridor. At the very end of the corridor, on Mrs. Razzolini's doorstep, he sees the three narcotics Agents talking with Mrs. Razzolini. We can hear snippets of their conversation.
66) 5) dialog: (whispering) Just as I thought -- the goddamn cops are grilling Mrs. Razzolini.
66) 8) dialog: Listen, she's just had her bottle. She's sleeping like a log. Let's just leave her in the apartment. What can possibly happen to her? She's as regular as clockwork. She won't wake up till 8:30 and we'll easily be back by then...
67) 0) text: The three men, slumped in their car, are watching the door of the apartment building. The three narcotics Agents emerge from the building and walk away. A short time goes by.

He lays Mary down in her basket, then places the basket on the bed, nestled between the wall and Peter's body. Michael, holding the soiled diaper, silently goes out. Once he's alone, Peter leans over the basket. Mary and he stare at each other intently and seriously. Peter switches off the light.
71) 0) text: The DOORBELL RINGS. Michael, asleep on his mattress on the    floor in the middle of his wrecked bedroom, emerges    from sleep and glances at his clock: it's 6:10 AM.      He staggers to t front door and opens it. The door is     being held toget with a string. Agents #1, #2, and #3 are at the door, with four other cops backing them up. Mrs. Razzolini is standing behind them and staring, wide- eyed, a look of horror on her face.
71) 1) dialog: Morning, officers. Can I help you?
71) 4) dialog: 
71) 7) dialog: You'll have to excuse the mess... We had a few friends over last night...
73) 2) dialog: (big smile)
73) 5) text: So do we. Michael closes the door and races into the living room where he discovers Peter putting on his jacket.
73) 6) dialog: (softly)
73) 10) dialog: You think so?    Really?
73) 13) dialog: But he said the investigation was closed.
74) 0) text: Michael is peeking out at the street from the window above. Peter comes out of the building and turns left, walking very quickly. Suddenly, Peter stops, turns     around and retraces his steps. We can clearly see a      man, who was walking abo six yards behind Peter on the     opposite side of the street, also turn around and     retrace his steps. It is Graton.
75) 3) dialog: There's one guy for sure! A redhead, kind of young, disguised sort of like a college student.
75) 6) dialog: I have the feeling they'll come to us.
76) 0) text: Michael is walking on the street carrying two bags of groceries. Suddenly, a guy walks up to him and elbows him sharply.

76) 6) text: We'll call you tonight. He runs off, disappearing into the darkness. From the slit-open grocery bag milk flows out onto the sidewalk. Michael is shaking all over. Standing about twenty yards away, Graton hasn't missed a thing.
77) 0) text: Not far from Peter, Michael and Jack's building, Graton, in his car, is talking into the microphone of his police radio.
78) 0) text: Peter and Michael are seated in the living room, which is still an utter wreck. They can't take their eyes off the phone that's between the two of them. They are sitting silently, not moving. Mary is playing in her basket. The PHONE RINGS.   Peter and Michael both jump three feet in the air. Michael picks up the phone.
78) 1) dialog: Hello? Who? Goddamn it, where are you?... (to Peter)
78) 7) dialog: (in a low tone)
78) 11) text: That goddamn mother fuckin' jerk of an asshole! I swear when he comes through the door I'll kill him!  I'll... The PHONE interrupts.   Michael leaps up and answers it.

78) 16) dialog: You think the cops have our phone bugged?
80) 6) text: Michael!... Peter -- where the hell are you, for Chrissakes? He runs like a madman into Peter's room and stops short on the threshold. Michael and Peter are each holding a handle of the basket as they rock it gently.

81) 4) text: His nerves! Ha. Ha. Ha. His nerves! Michael, his nerves! You wanna talk about nerves! Then just shut up and listen. It so happens we don't want a kid here either, but when someone dumps one on us, we take goddamn care of it.
81) 5) dialog: Yeah, we take goddam care of it.
81) 7) dialog: Peter couldn't leave. Jerry almost jumped out the window. It's lucky they even made it to the finals!
81) 10) dialog: And diapers. Have you ever tried to do diapers?
81) 13) dialog: And the day they wrecked the apartment, Peter came home and couldn't find Mary. I've never seen him in tears like that bef...
81) 19) dialog: And it just so happens, we've got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, even if she's yours! Peter and Michael exit, slamming the door.
83) 0) text: Mary is lying on the bed and Michael is putting the dope- filled diaper on her.
85) 0) text: MARY, wearing a bonnet and coat, is lying on one of the couches, CHIRPING merrily. Next  to her, also in his coat, Michael is just finishing wrapping a brown package which he puts in a plastic bag, along with a book, a baby rattle, and a clean diaper. Peter and Jack, disguised as punks, each with punk hairstyles and wearing black sunglasses, are climbing out the window leading to the fire escape.
86) 0) text: Michael exits the building. Mary, wrapped in a little woolen blanket, is in his arms. Michael is also carry- ing his plastic bag. Graton, in his car, is speaking into the radio mike.
87) 0) text: Michael is lying on the grass near the fountain with Mary on her blanket near him. Graton is nearby, also lying casually on the grass, watching them out of the corner of his eye. Michael glances at his watch, then at the passersby. The punk from the day before walks by with his arm around a girl. He strolls by casually. He spots Michael and their eyes meet. The couple sit down on a bench a few yards away and they begin "making out."
87) 2) dialog: What's going on?
87) 4) dialog: Sure. I gave it to them, just a moment ago.
87) 6) dialog: Is it against the law to give a box of candy to my friends? Peter and Jack take off their glasses.
87) 11) text: Holy shit! The diaper! Graton starts running like crazy back to the fountain. He rummages like a sick dog all around the spot where Michael had been lying. Suddenly he dashes toward the trash can and dumps out its contents, throwing the garbage around like a lunatic.
87) 13) dialog: (to the cops)
89) 0) text: In the devastated living room Peter, still disguised as a punk, and Michael, both very high, are dancing around in circles with each other and laughing. They are singing a lullaby at the top of their lungs, and har- monizing. Peter is holding Mary close, and Michael, holding a near-empty bottle of liquor, staggers over to him and starts turning around in circles with him. MARY, snuggled up warmly between Peter and Michael, is LAUGHING her head off. In the b.g., in the hall, Jack, also still in his punk getup, is on the phone. He's got a glass in his hand and is a little smashed.
91) 0) text: In the living room, Michael is sitting in front of the TV. He's not really watching -- he's eavesdropping on Jack's phone conversation.
91) 5) dialog: Why don't you call her back?
91) 8) dialog: Hello?... No, it's Michael... How are you?... Oh, she's doing just fine, she's in great shape. We're taking very good care of her, you have nothing to worry about. 'Bye. He hangs up.
91) 10) dialog: Sylvia -- She wanted to know how Mary was doing.
91) 12) dialog: She would have just hung up on you again. The important thing is she knows Mary's fine.
91) 15) dialog: (to himself)
93) 0) text: Michael and Jack are in the kitchen. Michael is making some bottles. Jack is watching him do it.
93) 1) dialog: You'll have four already made, this'll hold till Miami.
93) 3) dialog: Tell her to make sure Mary gets plenty of sleep.
93) 5) dialog: If her ass gets red, tell her not to listen to any pediatricians -- they're full of shit.
93) 7) dialog: Then she should give her a bottle of water instead of the regular bottle. Works like a charm: Her ass will be white as snow in three hours.
93) 10) dialog: Peter says her clothes should be washed by hand...
93) 13) dialog: (nodding)
93) 17) dialog: To put her to sleep we sing in harmony -- it always works.
93) 19) dialog: Solo works just as well.
93) 21) dialog: Now, as for the nipples, you've got to be very, very, very careful.
93) 22) dialog: As soon as the hole gets too big she's gotta throw them out -- This is extra, extra, extra-specially important -- 'cause if the hole's too big, the milk comes out too fast and it's bad for her digest...
94) 3) dialog: I am!
94) 5) dialog: On his way to Miami.
94) 7) dialog: No, he took Mary to his mother's, she couldn't wait to see her. He's gonna try to unload her on her till Sylvia gets back. I made her four bott...
94) 9) dialog: Don't worry, I told him everything he had to know, and I made her four bott...
94) 11) dialog: Why?
94) 13) dialog: Are you pissed off 'cause she's gone?
94) 15) dialog: I made her four bott...
94) 19) dialog: (to himself)
97) 3) text: Oh, yes, I was expecting you. Won't you come in... They disappear into the living room. Jack shuts the door behind him. Michael peeks into the hall, then goes and looks into the living room through the crack in the door. Peter, too, peeks in.
97) 5) dialog: Must be some nanny he found through an agency. Peter shrugs and walks away. Jack comes out of the living room.
97) 8) dialog: She's asleep.
99) 0) text: Behind the door, Jack rolls his eyes, Michael empathizes with him. They head back to the kitchen.
101) 0) text: Michael and Jack are sitting at the table.
102) 4) dialog: Look,  her mother'll be back in less  than five months. Let's not waste  a shitload of time looking for a  solution for such a short time.   Let's get organized.
102) 9) dialog: Come on, stop arguing, you two! Jack, you're going to have to ask to do the New York-Washington shu...
102) 11) dialog: (unruffled) That way, you can do the 6-10 A.M. shift. That amounts to two bottles and two diaper changes. You do the shopping when you get home in the evening and that's all. Peter, you'll take the 6-10 P.M. shift. That's two bottles and two diaper changes, her bath and her laundry. Since I work at home I'll take the longest shift from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. I'll take her to the park for an hour, but that's it. No shopping, no cooking, no cleaning.
102) 14) dialog: Well... I thought you might do it...
102) 17) dialog: Listen to me, you selfish bastards! My shift is eight hours in a row. No way I'm gonna do nights too. After 6 P.M. she can scream all she wants, I don't give a shit.
105) 0) text: Michael is working at his drafting table.      Jack rushe in, wearing his uniform, ready to go out.
105) 13) dialog: Come on, guys, cool it! It's my shift now. (to Jack)
106) 0) text: It's noon, the sun is   shining brightly. Michael is diapering Mary on her   changing table. She's naked. He tickles her, bites   her toes, neck and ears; she bursts out laughing.    Michael is totally gaga over her.
106) 2) dialog: Coochie, coochie, coo... woo, woo, woo... bippity, boppity boo... Peter comes rushing into the apartment and runs toward his room. He stops short in the corridor -- he hears Mary's laughter and Michael's coochie-coo's. Noiselessly he tiptoes over to the living room door and listens, troubled. Then he walks away and shouts, as though he were just coming out of his room.
106) 5) dialog: (without looking at him)
106) 9) dialog: (not moving either)
106) 12) dialog: (not budging an inch)
108) 11) dialog: (hushed voice)
108) 15) dialog: I've bought some stuff for her gums. He rubs some of the medication on Mary's gums.
109) 9) dialog: (exasperated) Will you quit fighting all the time? She just fell asleep, for Chrissake.
109) 12) dialog: (terribly upset) Okay, that's it. Into the kitchen. He exits, furious. Peter and Jack follow after him. Fuming, they file one after the other down the corridor past the stunned Brunette in her T-shirt who was waiting
109) 14) dialog: I've had it with you assholes! I won't be the buffer between you two anymore...
109) 17) dialog: I'm not a punching bag!   You assholes!
109) 20) dialog: One thing I know: I can't goddamn wait till Sylvia gets back!
110) 0) text: Peter, Michael and Jack have guests over for dinner. CLASSICAL MUSIC, a very fancy table, candles: they're at the tail-end of the dinner, before dessert. Everyone is very fashionably dressed. Natalie is sitting between Peter and Carl. Jay and Jerry, Peter's partners, are also there with their wives. Michael and Sophia are having a vehement discussion as usual, Jack is between two gorgeous models: CHRISTIE and CAROLINE.
110) 15) dialog: (in a low tone, to Jack)
110) 29) dialog: Well, it's... art. I'll be right back. He gets up and goes out.    Jack watches him.
111) 6) dialog: Oh shit -- the guests...
111) 9) dialog: And the hell with it.
112) 14) dialog: (very tense) Don't sit down -- it'll get worse. You have to walk around. Peter gets up and walks around.      Jack and Michael, standing, watch him walk. MARY SCREAMS even LOUDER as Peter walks back and forth in the room with her. The guests watch in uncomfortable silence.
112) 20) dialog: No, it's only because she's teething, she's usually very sweet... The guests remain silent.
112) 56) dialog: (trying to recover)
112) 81) dialog: Ta-da! Will you look at this? Is this a cake or what? Can someone make a little room on the table so I can... Are you guys leaving?
112) 83) dialog: Hey, where is everybody?
112) 86) dialog: Oh, never mind, don't worry... Good night... Jerry and his Wife exit. Michael is left standing there with his cake. Jack comes in, full of beans.
112) 88) dialog: Gone. Can you make a little room for me on the table to put the...
112) 90) dialog: Yeah, all of 'em, hey, can you make a little room for me to...
112) 96) dialog: Hey, could you make a little room for me on the table so I can...
112) 99) dialog: Oh, fuck it -- I'm sitting down. He sits down on a chair with the cake on his lap.
112) 104) dialog: And what about me? I'm a prisoner in this house all day long, forget about chasing ass, I haven't gotten laid in six months. When the hell is your friggin' Sylvia gonna come back?
112) 108) dialog: You better give your goddam Sylvia hell for this!
112) 111) dialog: Do you guys want some cake? (beat)
114) 21) text: Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll go get him... He exits like a sleepwalker and goes straight into Michael's room. The latter is asleep. Peter sits down on the edge of Michael's bed and gently shakes him.
115) 13) dialog: (taking the bibs) Thanks... I put the woolen things on the bottom and the diapers and lighter things on top, because you'll need those first...
115) 15) text: Yeah, sure... Michael bustles about. Sylvia's gaze comes to rest on the crib which stands imposingly in the middle of the living room. Music boxes, little booties and stuffed animals are hanging from the bars, and a pretty white tulle frames the crib.
115) 17) dialog: You'll have to come back and get the crib later.
116) 3) dialog: (equally tense)
116) 28) dialog: Yeah...
116) 32) dialog: Yeah, she'll manage...
116) 34) dialog: Sleeping late! Different women every night! I can't wait!
116) 37) dialog: And I've got six months' worth of sex to catch up on with Cathy, Nora, Frances, Susan, Barbra... They have entered the elevator. The doors close. They come out of the elevator, in front of their apartment.
116) 38) dialog: ...Christie, Paula, Sheila, Lisa, Kimberly, Rhonda, Rebecca, Louisa...
119) 0) text: Michael and Sophia are having a big discussion about contemporary art in the midst of a sophisticated crowd at an opening. Michael is vehement, gesturing wildly, and so is Sophia. They're both talking at once, not listening to each other, and enjoying it immensely.
122) 0) text: Michael is in bed. It's noon, the sun's shining brightly, and a BLONDE is asleep beside him. Michael is on the phone.
122) 1) dialog: Peter? Yeah? What? Yow-ee! Hooray! Terrific! That's fantastic! I'll call Jack -- We're gonna celebrate tonight! He hangs up.   The Blonde is now awake.
122) 2) dialog: They won!    They won!
122) 4) dialog: Peter.     He won the competition!
124) 0) text: Peter has his arm around Natalie's waist. She's a little drunk. He kisses her and leads her into his room, clos- ing the door behind him. Michael and Jack, who were spying on them, tiptoe over to the door. They are silently exulting over Peter's second victory.
127) 0) text: Michael and Sophia, both in kimonos, are sitting in front of the last bits of an elegant midnight supper, in Michael's room. The bed in unmade. Sophia, a glass of champagne in her hand, is yakking away nonstop, like a real motor-mouth. Michael, silent, is doodling on a paper napkin. His pen is making little squares and circles; the circles come together and start looking like a baby lying in a crib. Sophia is absorbed in her monologue. Suddenly Michael realizes what he has drawn. He crumples the napkin and throws it in the wastebasket. Sophia hasn't noticed anything. Michael is bored stiff.
132) 0) text: Jack and Michael, slumped in their chairs, are having breakfast. It's a gray day. It's POURING out. Peter, bending over a bowl of steaming water, with a towel over his head, is inhaling the steam. When he looks up to speak, we see his swollen tear-streaked
132) 4) dialog: (grim)
132) 19) dialog: Is there any jam left?
132) 25) dialog: Y'mean the Japanese one?
132) 28) dialog: Mary? A sudden, weighty silence ensues.
134) 0) text: Jack, in his pilot's uniform, is sitting on the living room couch. Michael is standing before him.
134) 1) dialog: You want me to call them?
134) 3) dialog: But you've got to let them know!
134) 5) dialog: C'mon, I'll call you a cab, you've still got time.
134) 7) dialog: But the plane's s'posed to take off in half an hour -- They won't have time to replace you. This is serious -- you'll lose your job and you won't be able to pay your share of the apartment anymore... you... Jack takes off his pilot's jacket and throws it aside.
134) 9) dialog: What the hell happened?
135) 0) text: Michael, wearing an apron and holding a wooden spoon, goes into Jack's room. The latter, lying on his bed, is smoking and staring at the ceiling.
135) 1) dialog: Come on, I made us a good dinner. I bought some filet mignon and Haagen-Dazs butter pecan. When Peter comes back he'll cheer you up...
135) 3) dialog: He has?    I didn't hear him...
135) 5) dialog: What? Michael heads towards Peter's room.    Jack feebly gets up and follows him. Michael knocks on the door.     No answer.
135) 6) dialog: Peter!    Dinner's ready! Still no answer. Michael opens the door:      Peter's lyi face-down on his bed. He's holding the rubber giraffe and sobbing. Michael and Jack, dismayed, stare at him. Peter hides his face in his arm. Jack and Michael go to the kitchen and sit down to their steaks, totally depressed.
136) 0) text: The DOORBELL RINGS. A bare-chested Michael, in jeans, drags himself over to the front door and opens it. There stands Sylvia with Mary in her stroller.
136) 3) dialog: (shouting towards Jack's room)
136) 20) dialog: Yeah, tell me about it! Finding time to take her to the park every day is a real bitch!
136) 27) dialog: She pulled the same thing on us. We lost all our friends in one night -- on account of one tooth!
136) 29) dialog: But you're beautiful -- At your age all you need is a good night's sleep and you'll look like new.
136) 32) dialog: We're old pros -- it's not a big deal for us...
136) 41) dialog: I'll go make up her bed! He exits, and, once in the corridor, prances around, leaping and dancing... He gets to the living room and goes over to the crib: suddenly, he recoils and freezes, a fearful expression on his face. Then he turns and races back to the kitchen.
136) 42) dialog: (floored) Hey, you guys -- come and see, come and see!
136) 44) dialog: Come see, I said. Jack and Peter nervously follow Michael into the living room. They stop short in front of the crib: There is Sylvia, curled up in a fetal position, sucking her thumb and sleeping like an angel.
136) 45) dialog: The poor thing, she's really wiped out.
136) 49) dialog: A room for her and a room for Mary...
136) 52) dialog: Yeah, she probably wouldn't want to move here. She'd think we'd jump on her any chance we could...
136) 54) dialog: She'll never want to...
