11) 18) dialog: The girl's... Sylvia's...
91) 2) text: Listen, Sylvia, you've got to come back. I travel, I can't take care of her... Yeah, but you're her mother... I'm her father -- what makes you so sure I'm the father!? The dates coincide! Big deal! That doesn't prove a thing... But she's still your kid, so do me a favor, get your ass back here immediately and take her off our hands... 'Cause we've got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, okay? Sylvia?... Hello! Hello! Sylvia, goddam it!
114) 1) dialog: (bursting with joy)
114) 2) text: Hello... I'm Sylvia, Mary's mother. I've come to get her...
114) 6) dialog: How's Mary doing?
114) 9) dialog: Can I see her?
114) 11) dialog: I don't believe how much she's grown! Recovering, wiping away her tears, she walks over to the playpen.
114) 12) dialog: Hello, Mary, hello my darling... She picks her up, hugs her tightly, showers kisses on her. MARY LAUGHS. Sylvia starts crying again.
114) 13) dialog: How beautiful she is... Her hair has grown... Look how much she changed, I missed it all. I missed her so much! Peter, in a kind of daze, stares at Sylvia. Without looking at Peter, she dries her eyes and tries to stop crying.
114) 14) dialog: I wanted to make life difficult for Jack but I never thought I'd miss her so much...
114) 17) dialog: Is he here?
114) 19) dialog: Is Jack here?
115) 0) text: Peter's giving Mary her bottle, Jack is carefully putting all her stuff into a bag -- bottles, nipples, cereals, etc. In the doorway Sylvia, with reddened eyes, silently watches them.
115) 2) text: Let's see, the five bottles, the little bottles for water, the strainer for her cereal... (to Sylvia)
115) 4) dialog: A blender?
115) 6) dialog: No, I don't have a blender.
115) 9) dialog: (to Peter) Do you want me to take her?
115) 12) dialog: Here are the bibs. Jack told me to give them...
115) 14) dialog: (her mind is elsewhere)
115) 15) text: Yeah, sure... Michael bustles about. Sylvia's gaze comes to rest on the crib which stands imposingly in the middle of the living room. Music boxes, little booties and stuffed animals are hanging from the bars, and a pretty white tulle frames the crib.
115) 18) dialog: Yeah...
116) 0) text: A taxi is there. Behind the    wheel the driver sits waiting. Sylvia is sitting    in the back, on the side nearest the sidewalk, and on   her lap is Mary, whom she's gently fondling. On the sidewalk, beside the   open trunk of the cab, are all Mary's belongings:    some bags, the playpen, a stroller, the baby bathtub,   the changing table, etc. Peter is attempting to pack it all in the trunk.    Micha is handing the things to him.
116) 10) dialog: I know, I'm sorry.
116) 13) dialog: Yeah, I bet... Actually, that was kind of the point... But I'm the one who really got screwed... She starts to cry again.
116) 15) dialog: (wiping her eyes) Yeah, it's great...
116) 17) dialog: Yeah, sure... I'm not loaded, but it's okay -- I'm working, I've got modeling jobs lined up...
116) 19) dialog: No. That's the last thing I need. I've got my work. And now I've got her. She rubs noses with Mary. Peter and Michael approach.
116) 23) dialog: (with a big, sad smile)
125) 2) dialog: Here you are, my angel... Are you okay, honey? Mommy's finished now, you've been a very, very good girl. (to Guard)
133) 0) text: Jack, holding a bouquet of flowers and Graton's rabbit, rings the doorbell of an apartment. On the door a card reads "SYLVIA AND MARY." A chubby YOUNG MAN with thick glasses opens the door.
136) 0) text: The DOORBELL RINGS. A bare-chested Michael, in jeans, drags himself over to the front door and opens it. There stands Sylvia with Mary in her stroller.
136) 2) dialog: Is Jack here? 'Cause I'm a mess. I can't handle it, I'm all alone...
136) 5) dialog: 'Cause my place is tiny, y'know, and my schedule's insane -- and I just finished four days of posing and we ended up every day at... Jack, bare-chested, comes in pulling on his jeans. He stops short at the front door. Sylvia is about to cry.
136) 6) dialog: (to Jack) Yeah, y'see, Jack, I just did four days of posing...
136) 8) dialog: And every day we finished at three in the morning and since Mary always gets up around 5:30...
136) 10) dialog: Well, you can imagine how much sleep I've gotten...
136) 12) dialog: And by the time I change her and play with her a little, it's already eight o'clock...
136) 14) dialog: And the babysitters till three A.M. -- all my money is sucked
136) 17) dialog: Oh, so the flowers and the rabbit were from you...
136) 19) dialog: I mean it, I can't cope anymore. My parents and I don't talk to each other and anyway they live in Texas, and the baby needs to get out to the park...
136) 21) dialog: And I have to work, I need the money to survive and anyway I love my job... A distraught Peter, bare-chested and in jeans, comes running in from his room.
136) 22) dialog: But to work I've gotta have a babysitter, and to have a babysitter I need to work, so I run around all day... (she sobs) ... and I'm not sure I'm taking good care of her...
136) 24) dialog: (sobbing) It's just 'cause I haven't slept in four nights -- she must be teething or something, I don't know but I can't manage...
136) 28) dialog: And just look    at my face! Nobody's going    to want me to model for them    with the way my face looks...    And what'll happen to me if they    don't want me anymore?
136) 30) dialog: Right, a good night's sleep -- but when?
136) 33) dialog: (blowing her nose, wiping her eyes) Really? I can leave her with you for a little while?
136) 35) dialog: I brought a couple of things for her, just for a few days... Michael eagerly takes the bag from her.    It's followed a second, and then a third.
136) 38) dialog: Yeah, it's time for her bottle -- it's all ready in the bag...
136) 40) dialog: Oh, okay, thanks... Peter, carrying Mary towards the kitchen, is followed by Jack and Michael with the bags. Sylvia blows her nose and walks around aimlessly in the hall. In the kitchen the three men bustle about with the bags, the bottle, the saucepan... They've swallowed all their pride and are kissing Mary all over, on her neck, her hands, her tummy. They're deliriously happy. Michael takes some sheets out of the bag.
136) 55) dialog: (very awake)
