42) 13) dialog: They opened fire on a bus full of civilians... He then spoke out publicly about it and then he refused to fight. He was jailed briefly then he returned to battle, was injured and given the Purple Heart.
42) 17) dialog: Which part?
42) 19) dialog: Oh... Josh awkwardly looks at his phone then back up. The four them are waiting.
42) 20) dialog: (stilted) It’s the same guy... Is that what I said? How did I say it? Jamie yawns, impatiently. Josh tries again:
42) 21) dialog: (acting now) It’s the same guy! Holy shit. Jamie, take a look at this. Tipper swings the camera at Jamie. He grabs Josh’s phone reacts almost identically.
42) 23) dialog: (excited, getting the hang of it) We have to go back!
42) 25) dialog: We have to get him talking about this. This is the movie! Now it’s not just some stupid Facebook thing. Jamie looks at Josh oddly. Josh backtracks:
42) 26) dialog: Not that that wasn’t a good idea too. But, and I hate this expression, but you stepped in shit! (suddenly) Cornelia!
42) 28) dialog: I don’t know! Jamie digs into his food.
42) 30) dialog: (decides to go for it) You know who you should talk to. Ira Mandelstam, the guy in my film he could tell you a lot about war and the politics of war.
42) 32) dialog: I don’t care. I want to share him with you. (to the table) Look ma, I’m sharing!
42) 38) dialog: (hushed) Can I say something I’m ashamed of?
42) 42) dialog: And I think Jamie’s great so --
42) 44) dialog: (snapping) I can’t fucking believe his idiotic Facebook idea paid off! It’s so fucking stupid! And my thing is a mess. A total fucking mess. (pause) Sorry, I feel bad saying that. But I also hate the fact he’s calling his band Cookie O’Puss.
42) 46) dialog: It’s just some funny old kitschy thing to him he saw on YouTube. But that was my commercial. I actually experienced it. You know?
42) 48) dialog: Really? It was for Carvel. Cookie Puss was the original one but they did an ice cream cake for Saint Patrick’s Day and it was this floating green Irish cake that said, “My name is Cookie O’Puss.” Cornelia is silent.
42) 49) dialog: (exhales) I’m being ridiculous. I probably don’t mean any of it.
42) 51) dialog: That’s because your dad has everything. And then he gets more. (off her look) No, he’s right. There’s enough to go around for everyone.
42) 56) dialog: Okay.
42) 59) dialog: Right.
42) 62) dialog: You cut it already? We just shot it two days ago.
42) 64) dialog: Maybe take a day or two to make sure you like it.
42) 67) dialog: I remember when this song was just considered bad! But it’s working.

43) 2) dialog: No.
43) 5) dialog: Well, maybe a good way to start is by asking you a question.
43) 8) dialog: Do you know the percentage of African American adult males currently in jail?
43) 10) dialog: Take a guess.
43) 12) dialog: Jesus, no! (pause) It's over 9%. That's nearly 1 in 10 African American adult males, nearly a million and half. 72.
43) 14) dialog: It's insane, but people don't realize this. They think because we have a black president...
43) 16) dialog: (thrown) No, not...no. (pause and then speaking quickly) There's a section, an Entr'acte really, on the function of race in the prison industrial complex... (trying to get back on track) But the film is really about how power in America works... Do you know the historian, Ira Mandelstam?
43) 18) dialog: (pleased) Really?
43) 20) dialog: Well, we have over a hundred hours of interviews with him. Now --
43) 22) dialog: No, we'll cut it. Now, this guy, he’s not particularly charismatic, he’s kind of anti-social, maybe asbergers, but not interesting asbergers. He’s kind of boring even. But he’s a charismatic thinker. 73.
43) 24) dialog: (what?!) No, not cartoons. He says it.
43) 26) dialog: Well...yes, but like many boring things, the longer you watch it, it takes on a different dimension -- Josh wipes the sweat that has now accumulated on his face Dave's glance goes to his Blackberry. He types something quickly.
43) 28) dialog: It’s really a very simple idea. The three sections correspond to the three nodes of what Mills called the power elite: the political, military and economic. But, and this is key, each part has to interconnect to show how none of these three nodes functions without the other. Dave tries to surreptitiously glance at his Blackberry.
43) 29) dialog: It’s a linear film of course, but I imagine it as a kind of hypertext. To be clear, the film is really about the working class and, I can’t speak on behalf of the working class. I can't make their film, of course. They have to be felt as the impossible subject of the text. Through an examination of the power structure the voice of the working class has to be revealed in the margins through its very absence. If that makes sense. The phone rings. Both Dave and Josh look at it.
43) 31) dialog: (barrels on) But it’s not even really about the power structure but about what it means to make a film about it. It’s about the very possibility of making this film...It’s really about America. Dave can’t help it. He lunges for the phone. The sound of KNOCKING. INT. BREITBART’S APARTMENT - DOORWAY. DAY 48 Josh stands in the doorway, he wears his bike helmet and holds his hat. Breitbart smiles.
43) 33) dialog: Would you watch what I have? I think I’m at a point where I need a new set of eyes.
43) 35) dialog: Yeah.
43) 40) dialog: Okay. Breitbart goes to his kitchen. Josh waits, impatiently.
43) 42) dialog: Uh huh.
43) 44) dialog: Uh huh. Breitbart reappears in the kitchen doorway.
43) 46) dialog: Yes, because it connects to what he’s saying about the shift in power in the contemporary global economy. And, of course, it relates back to the earlier stuff on the Ottoman Empire.
43) 48) dialog: The interview with Tillie Kupferschmidst’s great great niece? That’s the emotional center of the movie. That’s where things come together. Without that scene...why make the film at all? 76.
43) 50) dialog: It has to be long. The point is it makes you uncomfortable.
43) 52) dialog: Well, maybe boredom is your defense from the discomfort.
43) 54) dialog: I understand, I understand. I think I need to shoot some more interviews --
43) 56) dialog: Yeah? I just don’t think you're getting it or maybe there’s something about me or what you saw that’s clouding your judgement.
43) 58) dialog: I don’t believe it. I think you’re being deliberately critical.
43) 60) dialog: Bullshit! Is it because Cornelia and I didn’t have children?
43) 62) dialog: We tried. There were miscarriages. I had to give her a shot in her ass every day for three months. It’s a huge fucking needle.
43) 64) dialog: We didn’t want to hope for something we probably couldn’t have. (collecting his things) This was a mistake.
43) 66) dialog: I know you think I didn’t reach my potential.
43) 68) dialog: You know what? I’m sorry I didn’t become you.

43) 80) dialog: Nah, I don’t have the right shoes. (pause) Hey, I was thinking...you know how you asked...maybe, if you’re still up for it, I will co-direct with you... Jamie hesitates.

The space is packed -- mostly w a sea of 20-something kids who lie on top of each other o the floor watching Jamie’s movie. Tipper, dressed up ina sort of Mary Jane outfit and horn-rimmed glasses, perched on a table, watching very seriously, her arms wrapped aro her long bent legs. Jamie stands in back, he looks nervou Darby a few feet away from him is texting. Cornelia waves from a crowded corner. Josh smiles wearily. Kent talks soberly on screen.
43) 91) dialog: Sorry, sorry. Josh stops in his tracks. Over on the side, the Moon Land headline above his head, stands Breitbart. To his right, hedge fund dude, Dave. Blue (09/16/2013) 80. A light sweat breaks out on Josh’s face. Darby is looking straight at him. She gives him a sad smile. Josh looks ba at the screen. CLOSE: Josh’s scholar, Ira, talking about the politics of war. CUT TO: The movie is over. The mostly 20-something crowd laughs, drinks beers. Breitbart picks an Oreo from a bowl Oreos on a table. Josh pushes through the kids to find Jamie.
43) 93) dialog: You invited Breitbart?
43) 95) dialog: He called you?
43) 97) dialog: At “our dinner?” Dinner with him? When did you have dinner?
43) 99) dialog: Uh huh. (pause) Where'd you go?
43) 101) dialog: Jackson Hole.
43) 103) dialog: That’s where he goes. 81.
43) 105) dialog: Yes, I’ve been there with hima million times.
43) 107) dialog: Of course!
43) 109) dialog: I guess I wish you'd asked me before you just went to him...
43) 111) dialog: So you called him?
43) 113) dialog: You said he called you.
43) 115) dialog: Does Cornelia know?
43) 120) dialog: (taken aback) You're going to Afghanistan?
43) 123) dialog: Um, if you have any other editing work, my guy Tim, is great and could use some cash.
43) 125) dialog: (defeated) I‘1l text you his info.
43) 127) dialog: Ahh! It’s Cornelia. She smokes a cigarette.
43) 129) dialog: You're smoking? (ve: everything) What’s going on? This is like a fucking bad dream. Everyone is here doing weird shit. Where’s my highschool algebra teacher, Mr. Morelli riding a fucking turtle? Across the room, Breitbart is approached by Dave and Jami
43) 131) dialog: Are you sure? Are you sure you’re not just saying that?
43) 133) dialog: Do you think Jamie came to my talk because he knew I was married to you? That this was all so he could meet your dad?
43) 135) dialog: You know, fuck you.
43) 137) dialog: I’m saying “Fuck you” in that way Jamie and Darby say it where it’s not a real Fuck you, it’s a semi-playful Fuck you. 84.
43) 139) dialog: It is real.
43) 141) dialog: Fuck you. Total real, cutting to the core: Fuck you.

45) 8) dialog: I’m sorry... (realizing) Isn’t that also how Jamie’s mom died? He talks about it in the film. Darby hesitates.
45) 10) dialog: I was trying out being generous. He'd do the same for me. That’s how you guys are.
45) 12) dialog: A man-fox? I wish it didn’t need the “man” qualifier?

46) 2) dialog: I went dancing with Darby at an after hours gay club. (angry and suspicious) Is this some kind of private meeting?
46) 4) dialog: I follow him on Twitter! You can’t lie like we used to lie anymore. Everything is reported. Nothing is private.
46) 6) dialog: Don’t lie to me. You kissed him. I know all about it.
46) 8) dialog: Don’t call me Joshy! You don’t call me Joshy. 90.
46) 10) dialog: It’s all a pose...it’s like he once saw a sincere person and has been imitating him ever since! And you’re falling for it.
46) 12) dialog: They're entitled little brats. And don’t you see, this is alla plan. He wants to destroy me. Jamie appears across the street, he holds a small video camera. He waves at Josh.
46) 13) dialog: Go back inside! Josh takes off his porkpie hat.
46) 14) dialog: You and your father can have him. You always wanted a more successful me, so go for it.
46) 16) dialog: I didn’t know when we got married that you also wanted to play kissy face with the twenty-five year olds. I didn’t know you wouldn’t want to have kids.
46) 18) dialog: I'll finish it! I want to get it right.

47) 8) dialog: It seems kind of cool though.

They're inches apart.

50) 23) dialog: Yeah...we need distractions. For me it’s the internet. I’m trying to go on less, you know. You know, it’s like how many times can I check the Huffington Post? Kent does a card trick for some kids.
50) 27) dialog: Sorry. What made you contact Jamie on Facebook? Kent looks at Josh strangely. Josh shovels a piece of cak into his mouth.
50) 29) dialog: (clears his throat) What made you reach out to him?
50) 32) dialog: Really?
50) 34) dialog: Ow! Fuck!
50) 38) dialog: Sorry. (beat) But you remembered Darby...
50) 40) dialog: Did she know about...that you were in the hospital? Kent hesitates.
50) 42) dialog: I’m Jamie’s cameraman.
50) 44) dialog: Fact checking the movie?
50) 48) dialog: What did you think when Jamie talked about Darby’s childhood as if it was his own?
50) 50) dialog: He said that when?

52) 9) dialog: He let me think I was the one who found out about Kent in Afghanistan. Why?
52) 13) dialog: But why not tell it honestly?
52) 15) dialog: Of course he had body issues, they were yours. (off her look) I don’t mean, of course you had body issues, but... (pause) People have to know. He can’t get away with this.
52) 17) dialog: This goes against everything he said he admired in me. The whole principle of making a doc. Darby, you don’t understand. This is fraud. It’s a big deal. People are jailed for this kind of thing.

68) 6) dialog: I can’t let Cornelia and Leslie walk down this road with you. I want you to go in there and tell them what you’ve done. If you won’t, I’1l do it for you. For a brief moment, Jamie’s face elicits what looks like fear. It passes.
68) 8) dialog: I’m sorry, kid. But there are standards, there are...standards.
68) 10) text: Josh walks with purpose toward the table. Jamie trails behind him.
68) 12) dialog: Sorry I’m late. (to Breitbart) Leslie, I caught your speech from the lobby, though and it was really inspiring, spot on...
68) 14) dialog: Jamie has something he wants to tell all of you. Josh takes a seat and crosses his legs comfortably.
68) 15) dialog: Go ahead. They all look at him and then Jamie blankly.
68) 19) dialog: “Yeah?” And...
68) 21) dialog: You did a lot more than that, come on. Josh stands back up. He says to the table: 112.
68) 22) dialog: He didn’t even know Kent. Darby did. And Darby’s mother died of ovarian cancer. Jamie’s mom is probably alive and kicking in Idaho. He sits back down.
68) 24) dialog: You just need to hear this.
68) 26) dialog: No, that’s not basically it! You knew that Kent had tried to kill himself...
68) 28) dialog: Say it!
68) 31) dialog: I never said it was amazing. I just said it was faked.
68) 33) dialog: Stop with the time-line crap! Josh pulls out his video camera and gestures with it.
68) 34) dialog: Jamie knew that Kent tried to kill himself. That he’d been in Afghanistan. We didn’t just stumble upon it. It was rigged. Jamie invented the whole Facebook thing because he knew it would play better.
68) 36) dialog: No, Kent was in Afghanistan.
68) 38) dialog: It’s...it’s...the way, the way he said that he found him is not true.
68) 42) dialog: Of course it matters. Leslie, explain...
68) 44) dialog: (shocked) What? Dave leans in from the next table. 114.
68) 46) dialog: (dismissive) I didn’t expect you to care. (quickly back to Leslie) Leslie, are you kidding me? You don’t care? You just gave a speech about authenticity!
68) 49) dialog: I can’t believe it! This movie isn’t worth the...RAM...it’s...stored on. (pointing at Jamie) He’s acon artist. Leslie, your generation of sit-ins and protesters and...pack rats would be horrified by this...demon!
68) 51) dialog: (hysterically) I’m not hysterical! He swings his arm, gesturing, knocking a tray full of foo and glasses out of a waiter’s arms. It goes crashing to t ground.
68) 52) dialog: Shit, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. He helps the waiter pick up the plates. Everyone at the table waits. Josh finally gets back up.
68) 53) dialog: Cornelia... 115.
68) 55) dialog: This is so frustrating! I’m going to get no satisfaction here, am I? This guy’s just going to win no matter what. Everyone at the table stares at Josh. His says with certainty:
68) 56) dialog: This is not how the world works. We MOVE in on Josh. His face fills with emotion.
68) 58) dialog: Forget ethics then. What about me?! You played me. I was played.
