He kicks in the window, breaks the frame with his axe, and dives in. A beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified smudged little girl. He hands the little girl over the ra to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way -- a  ladder. Dennis's face lifts and grins at Brian; dirty, bigger tha life, invincible. He winks a wink only possible between  fathers and sons and he's gone again, back into the swirl darkness. As Brian stands there, full of love, full of pr he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack; relea a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over the roof The flame seems to pause, to stare at Brian a beat. Shhh, don't tell anyone. Brian is transfixed, his little head  staring up in astonishment. Nobody else has noticed it.

Plaster, wood and something metal that cracks against the pavement and  spins slowly. A fire helmet. And Adcox is coming out the door now, blackened and torn, hopeless tears streaming down his face.
5) 4) text: And, spotting Brian, he runs towards him. And the helmet  spins and spins and Adcox keeps running, and the sky is  raining fire, and the flame on the roof has risen up now its full, horrifying size and it's laughing now, laughing the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning, and read the printing on the neck guard.
