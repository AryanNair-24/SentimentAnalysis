5) 0) text: There are six tables in two rows of three. Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in and sits at the table behind her. Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there. In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout desk and takes a few things in the process. He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian reluctantly gets up and moves. Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his feet up. Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the library and sits in the back corner table, just behind Brian. Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker. Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away. Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the job.
5) 36) dialog: Hey, yer not urinating in here man!
5) 38) dialog: You whip it out and you're dead before the first drop hits the floor! Bender gasps mockingly.

7) 8) dialog: Who the hell are you to judge anybody anyway?
7) 10) dialog: You know, Bender...you don't even count.  I mean if you disappeared forever it wouldn't make any difference.  You may as well not even exist at this school. Bender probably is upset at this and he pauses a moment before speaking.  He doesn't let his emotions out, however.
7) 14) dialog: No, they wouldn't take you.
7) 29) dialog: Hey let's watch the mouth, huh? Brian again feels he needs to contribute.
7) 52) dialog: Look, you guys keep up your talking and Vernon's gonna come right in here...I got a meet this Saturday and I'm not gonna miss it on account of you boneheads...

7) 67) dialog: (defensive)
7) 68) text: Shut up! They hear Vernon moving around out in the hall so Bender quickly comes and sits in the chair between Claire and Andrew.  He folds his hands on the table. Vernon goes back into his office.  Bender laughs and gets up.  He starts walking towards the double doors that separate the library from the hallway.

11) 34) text: Let's go...go!  Get back into your seat. Andrew sits.
11) 74) text: Fuck you! We see the clock, it reads a quarter to eight. We see Bender, lighting his shoe on fire and lighting a cigarette with his shoe. We see Claire thinking. We see Brian playing with his balls. We see Andrew playing with his sweatshirt. We see Allison pulling a string around her finger and making it turn purple. We see Bender put the flames on his shoe out.  He then plays air guitar. We see Allison drawing. We see Andrew playing paper football.  He cheers silently. Allison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture. We see everyone fall asleep.
13) 0) text: Later. We see the clock, it now says 10:22. We see Andrew stretching.  We see Bender tearing pages out of a book.  He is tossing them around.

13) 10) dialog: Hey, you grounded tonight? Claire shrugs.
13) 12) dialog: Big party at Stubbies, parents are in Europe.  Should be pretty wild...

13) 27) dialog: You're just feeling sorry for yourself...
13) 29) dialog: Aw...you're breaking my heart...
13) 31) dialog: What? Bender jumps down and goes next to Andrew.
13) 33) dialog: Well if I say yes, I'm an idiot, right?
13) 35) dialog: You know something, man...If we weren't in school right now, I'd waste you! Bender points his middle finger at the floor.
13) 44) dialog: Why do you have to insult everybody?
13) 46) dialog: Yeah well, he's gotta name!
13) 48) dialog: Yeah, (to Brian)
13) 51) dialog: See...
13) 76) dialog: Leave her alone! Bender slowly stands and faces Andrew.
13) 77) dialog: I said leave her alone!
13) 79) dialog: Yeah... Bender walks over to where Andrew is standing.
13) 81) dialog: Just me, just you and me.  Two hits. Me hitting you, you hitting the floor!  Anytime you're ready, pal! Bender goes to hit him but Andrew gets Bender down on the ground with a wrestling move.
13) 83) dialog: Why not? Bender gets up.
13) 85) dialog: Chicken shit... Andrew turns and walks away.  Bender takes out a switchblade and opens it. He stabs the switchblade into a chair.
13) 86) dialog: Let's end this right now.  You don't talk to her...you don't look at her and you don't even think about her! You understand me?
13) 98) dialog: Shit!

16) 3) dialog: Okay...forget I asked... Allison waits for two beats and then speaks.
16) 5) dialog: Vodka?  When do you drink vodka?
16) 7) dialog: A lot? Allison smiles.
16) 9) dialog: Is that why you're here today? Allison doesn't answer.
16) 10) dialog: Why are you here? Allison snaps back.
16) 12) dialog: Um, I'm here today...because uh, because my coach and my father don't want me to blow my ride.  See I get treated differently because uh, Coach thinks I'm a winner.  So does my old man.  I'm not a winner because I wanna be one... I'm a winner because I got strength and speed.  Kinda like a race horse. That's about how involved I am in what's happening to me.
16) 14) dialog: Forget it!
18) 12) dialog: What's your problem? Allison opens her sandwich and and tosses the meat up. It lands on the sculpture above. She opens some pixie stix and pours the sugar on the sandwich and then puts Cap'n Crunch on top of that. She crushes the sandwich together and loudly eats it. Bender goes over and sits by Brian, Bender takes Brian's bag lunch.
18) 32) dialog: Alright, what about your family?
18) 34) dialog: That's real easy! Bender stands again and points forward.
18) 49) dialog: That's bullshit.  It's all part of your image, I don't believe a word of it. Bender actually looks hurt. BENDER
18) 51) dialog: No...
18) 53) dialog: Did I stutter? Bender comes over to Andrew and rolls up his right sleeve to reveal a circular shaped burn.
18) 58) dialog: How would I know, I mean he lies about everything anyway!
20) 9) dialog: Beats me...
20) 11) dialog: I dunno...
20) 13) dialog: You ask me one more question and I'm beating the shit out of you!
20) 15) dialog: Slob!
20) 18) dialog: Screw that Bender...put it back! Bender walks away.
20) 21) dialog: Shut up! Andrew follows the other two.  Brian looks at Allison who is standing there with her mouth open.
20) 24) dialog: You better be right, if Vernon cuts us off it's your fault, asshole!
20) 28) dialog: No, the activities hall.
20) 30) dialog: No you don't know what you're talking about! Allison squeaks.
20) 31) dialog: Now we're through listening to you, we're going this way. They all go Andrew's way and run into a hall closed by an iron gate.
20) 32) dialog: Shit!

28) 38) dialog: This is the worst fake ID I've ever seen... Brian laughs.
28) 39) dialog: Do you realize you made yourself sixty eight?
28) 41) dialog: What do you need a fake ID for?
28) 46) dialog: Holy shit!  What is all that stuff?

28) 65) dialog: Hi, you wanna talk?
28) 67) dialog: Why not?
28) 69) dialog: Where do you want me to go?

30) 65) dialog: Be honest...
30) 68) dialog: Answer the question, Claire!
30) 78) dialog: You're just pissed off because she got you to admit something you didn't want to admit to...
30) 80) dialog: What's bizarre?  I mean we're all pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all.
30) 84) dialog: She's right...do you guys know what, uh, what I did to get in here?  I taped Larry Lester's buns together. Claire laughs.
30) 87) dialog: (to Brian)
30) 90) dialog: Well then you know how hairy he is, right?  Well, when they pulled the tape off, most of his hair came off and some, some skin too...
30) 92) dialog: And the bizarre thing is, is that I did it for my old man...I tortured this poor kid, because I wanted him to think that I was cool. He's always going off about, you know, when he was in school...all the wild things he used to do.  And I got the feeling that he was disappointed that I never cut loose on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm sitting in the locker room, and I'm taping up my knee.  And Larry's undressing a couple lockers down from me.  Yeah...he's kinda... he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I started thinking about my father, and his attitude about weakness. And the next thing I knew, I uh, I jumped on top of him and started wailing on him...And my friends, they just laughed and cheered me on. And afterwards, when I was sittin' in Vernon's office, all I could think about was Larry's father. And Larry havin' to go home and...and explain what happened to him.  And the humiliation...fucking humiliation he mustuv felt.  It mustuv been unreal...I mean, (he's crying)
30) 93) text: I mean, how do you apologize for something like that?  There's no way...it's all because of me and my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate him!  He's like this...he's like this mindless machine that I can't even relate to anymore..."Andrew, you've got to be number one!  I won't tolerate any losers in this family...Your intensity is for shit! Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish my knee would give...and I wouldn't be able to wrestle anymore.  And he could forget all about me...
30) 114) dialog: I can...uh...tape all your buns together...
30) 121) dialog: All right, great!  Where'd you learn to do that?
30) 126) dialog: You fucking prick! Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his words hitting home.
