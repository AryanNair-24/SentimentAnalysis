0) 1) dialog: Saturday...March 24, 1984.  Shermer High School, Shermer, Illinois. 60062.  Dear Mr. Vernon...we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was that we did wrong, what we did was wrong.  But we think you're crazy to make us write this essay telling you who we think we are, what do you care?  You see us as you want to see us...in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions.  You see us as a brain, an athelete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. Correct?  That's the way we saw each other at seven o'clock this morning. We were brainwashed...

5) 0) text: There are six tables in two rows of three. Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in and sits at the table behind her. Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there. In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout desk and takes a few things in the process. He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian reluctantly gets up and moves. Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his feet up. Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the library and sits in the back corner table, just behind Brian. Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker. Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away. Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the job.
5) 11) dialog: You know, I can answer that right now sir...That'd be "No", no for me. 'cause...

Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the same time.  They both notice this.  Brian stops removing his jacket. Bender takes his all the way off.  Brian rubs his hands together and pretends to be cold.  He pulls his jacket back on.  He turns and looks at Bender who is still staring at him.
5) 26) dialog: It's the shits, huh? Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable laugh. Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper.  He throws it at Claire.  It misses and goes over Claire's head. Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore Bender. Bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a song.  В“Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...В

We see Bender put the flames on his shoe out.  He then plays air guitar. We see Allison drawing. We see Andrew playing paper football.  He cheers silently. Allison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture. We see everyone fall asleep.
13) 6) dialog: I love his work. Bender tosses the rest of the pages at Brian.  He picks up the card catalogue drawer and begins to take cards out.

17) 33) dialog: You know he's lying, right?
17) 35) dialog: Yeah, but it was only...was only because I didn't want her to know that I was a virgin, okay? Bender just stares at him.
17) 36) dialog: Excuse me for being a virgin, I'm sorry... Claire laughs.
17) 38) dialog: Because it's personal business, it's my personal, private business.
17) 41) dialog: You do? Claire smiles and nods.
18) 14) dialog: Uh, it's your standard, regular lunch I guess... Bender reaches in the bag and pulls out a thermos.  He sets it on the table and points at it.
