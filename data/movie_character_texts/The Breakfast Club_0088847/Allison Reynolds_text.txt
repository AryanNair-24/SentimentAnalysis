Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there. In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout desk and takes a few things in the process. He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian reluctantly gets up and moves. Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his feet up. Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the library and sits in the back corner table, just behind Brian. Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker. Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away. Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the job.

We see Brian playing with his balls. We see Andrew playing with his sweatshirt. We see Allison pulling a string around her finger and making it turn purple. We see Bender put the flames on his shoe out.  He then plays air guitar. We see Allison drawing. We see Andrew playing paper football.  He cheers silently. Allison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture. We see everyone fall asleep.
