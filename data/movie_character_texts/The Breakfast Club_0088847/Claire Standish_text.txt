1) 1) dialog: I can't believe you can't get me out of this...I mean it's so absurd I have to be here on a Saturday! It's not like I'm a defective or anything...
5) 0) text: There are six tables in two rows of three. Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in and sits at the table behind her. Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there. In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout desk and takes a few things in the process. He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian reluctantly gets up and moves. Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his feet up. Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the library and sits in the back corner table, just behind Brian. Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker. Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away. Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the job.
5) 2) dialog: Excuse me, sir?  I think there's been a mistake.  I know it's detention, but...um...I don't think I belong in here... Vernon doesn't care.  He just continues to talk.
5) 27) dialog: (to herself)

5) 67) dialog: (screams)
7) 9) dialog: Really...
7) 16) dialog: You know why guys like you knock everything...
7) 19) dialog: It's 'cause you're afraid.
7) 22) dialog: You're a big coward! Brian feels left out.
7) 25) dialog: See you're afraid that they won't take you.  You don't belong so you just have to dump all over it...
7) 27) dialog: Well you wouldn't know...You don't even know any of us.
7) 36) dialog: That's an academic club...
7) 38) dialog: So...academic clubs aren't the same as other kinds of clubs.
7) 47) dialog: (to Bender)
7) 50) dialog: (laughs) (to Bender)
7) 68) text: Shut up! They hear Vernon moving around out in the hall so Bender quickly comes and sits in the chair between Claire and Andrew.  He folds his hands on the table. Vernon goes back into his office.  Bender laughs and gets up.  He starts walking towards the double doors that separate the library from the hallway.
7) 72) dialog: What are you gonna do?
11) 6) dialog: We were just sitting here, like we were s'posed to... Vernon looks around and looks at Bender.
11) 18) dialog: Excuse me, sir, why would anybody want to steal a screw?
11) 54) dialog: (worried)
11) 55) text: Cut it out! Claire mouths the word "Stop" to Bender.
11) 74) text: Fuck you! We see the clock, it reads a quarter to eight. We see Bender, lighting his shoe on fire and lighting a cigarette with his shoe. We see Claire thinking. We see Brian playing with his balls. We see Andrew playing with his sweatshirt. We see Allison pulling a string around her finger and making it turn purple. We see Bender put the flames on his shoe out.  He then plays air guitar. We see Allison drawing. We see Andrew playing paper football.  He cheers silently. Allison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture. We see everyone fall asleep.
13) 4) dialog: (pronouncing it correctly)
13) 11) dialog: I don't know, my mom said I was but by dad told me to just blow her off.
13) 13) dialog: Yeah?
13) 15) dialog: I doubt it...
13) 17) dialog: Well 'cause if I do what my mother tells me not to do, it's because because my father says it's okay. There's like this whole big monster deal, it's endless and it's a total drag.  It's like any minute... divorce...
13) 19) dialog: What?
13) 21) dialog: They're both strict.
13) 23) dialog: I dunno, I'd probably go live with my brother.  I mean, I don't think either one of them gives a shit about me...it's like they use me just to get back at each other. Suddenly, from the back of the room.  Allison speaks.
13) 26) dialog: Shut up!
13) 28) dialog: Yeah, well if I didn't nobody else would.
13) 54) dialog: (to Bender)
13) 57) dialog: Claire...
13) 59) dialog: Claire...it's a family name!
13) 61) dialog: Well thank you...
13) 63) dialog: I'm not fat!
13) 66) dialog: (resentfully)
13) 67) text: I'm not that pristine! Bender bends down closer to Claire.
13) 71) dialog: Why don't you just shut up?
13) 73) text: Have you ever been felt up?  Over the bra, under the blouse, shoes off...hoping to God your parents don't walk in? Claire is getting upset.
13) 74) dialog: Do you want me to puke?
15) 8) dialog: I have a very low tolerance for dehydration.
17) 0) text: Claire and Bender and Brian are all sitting around waiting for the Cokes.
17) 2) dialog: No thank you...
17) 5) dialog: Can't you just leave me alone?
17) 7) dialog: You know what I wish I was doing?
17) 10) dialog: I wish I was on a plane to France.
17) 19) text: Claire spins around.
17) 20) dialog: What are you talking about?
17) 24) dialog: No!  Drop what, what're you talking about?
17) 26) dialog: (to Brian)
17) 30) dialog: You know I don't appreciate this very much, Brian.
17) 37) dialog: Why didn't you want me to know you were a virgin?
17) 40) dialog: I think it's okay for a guy to be a virgin... Bender looks suprised.
18) 0) text: Later. Everybody has lunches now. Claire begins to take hers out of a small shopping bag.
18) 2) dialog: Guess, where's your lunch?
18) 4) dialog: You're nauseating... Bender grabs a Coke and tosses it over to Allison who catches it without even looking up. Bender then watches Claire set up a sushi platter.
18) 6) dialog: Sushi...
18) 8) dialog: Rice, uh, raw fish and seaweed.
18) 10) dialog: Can I eat?
18) 56) dialog: (to Andrew)
20) 2) dialog: (to Bender)
20) 5) dialog: Well then, how do you know when he'll be back?
20) 35) dialog: (to Andrew)
24) 10) dialog: Really, sir, there wasn't any noise... Claire squeels.  She squeezes Bender's head between her knees. Everyone starts faking a coughing fit.
24) 11) dialog: (flustered)
24) 15) text: And you!  I will not be made a fool of! He turns and walks away.  We see that he still has the toilet seat cover stuck to his pants. Vernon leaves. Everyone laughs except Claire who lets Bender out to a barage of slaps.
24) 17) dialog: You're an asshole!
26) 0) text: Brian, Bender and Claire are sitting in a circle and laughing hysterically. Bender lights Claire up and she coughs the smoke out. Brian laughs at her.  He exhales and tries to eat the smoke.  He talks in a really weird voice.
26) 2) dialog: Do you know how popular I am?  I'm so popular, everybody loves me so much, at this school...
28) 20) dialog: Are all these your girlfriends?
28) 22) dialog: What about the others?
28) 24) dialog: Consider what?
28) 26) dialog: You don't believe in just one guy, one girl?
28) 28) dialog: Yeah...that's the way it should be.
28) 30) dialog: Why not? Bender clearly doesn't want to answer that.  He acts defensive.
28) 32) dialog: How come you got so many girlfriends?
28) 34) dialog: (shrugs)
28) 37) dialog: Oh... We cut back to where Andrew, Brian and Allison are sitting, Andrew is looking through Brian's wallet.
30) 2) dialog: That's boring...
30) 4) dialog: The idea is to like search your mind for the absolute limit.  Like, uh, would you drive to school naked? Andrew laughs.
30) 6) dialog: Of course...
30) 8) dialog: It doesn't matter...spring...
30) 10) dialog: Either one...
30) 14) dialog: You're lying...
30) 16) dialog: Lie...
30) 21) dialog: Very nice...
30) 23) dialog: He's an adult! Allison is relishing this attention.
30) 25) dialog: Do you have any idea how completely gross that is?
30) 27) dialog: First few times?  You mean he did it more than once?
30) 29) dialog: Are you crazy?
30) 33) dialog: I don't even have a psychiatrist...
30) 35) dialog: Now, didn't we already cover this?
30) 37) dialog: Look, I'm not gonna discuss my private life with total strangers.
30) 39) dialog: A what?
30) 41) dialog: Wrong...
30) 44) dialog: Oh why don't you just forget it...
30) 48) dialog: I don't do anything!
30) 50) dialog: Okay, lemme ask you a few questions. Allison is suddenly defensive.
30) 52) dialog: No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep around without being in love.  I mean don't you want any respect?
30) 54) dialog: Not the only difference, I hope.
30) 56) dialog: I'm not a tease!
30) 58) dialog: No, I never said that, she twisted my words around.
30) 60) dialog: I don't use it period! Claire is on the verge of tears.
30) 62) dialog: I didn't mean it that way!  You guys are putting words into my mouth!
30) 72) dialog: (screaming)
30) 75) dialog: You are such a bitch!  You did that on purpose just to fuck me over!
30) 77) dialog: I can't believe you, you're so weird.  You don't say anything all day and then when you open your mouth...you unload all these tremendous lies all over me!
30) 79) dialog: Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it any less bizarre...
30) 81) dialog: (to Andrew)
30) 91) dialog: Oh my God...
30) 96) dialog: What's wrong with you?  Why don't you like yourself?
30) 107) dialog: Okay so neither one of you is any better than the other one... Allison feels left out.
30) 109) dialog: With your feet?
30) 112) dialog: (to Andrew)
30) 116) dialog: I can't do anything.
30) 118) dialog: There's one thing I can do, no forget it, it's way too embarrassing.
30) 120) dialog: Okay, but you have to swear to God you won't laugh...I can't believe I'm actually doing this... Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage. When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect. Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.
30) 122) dialog: Camp, seventh grade...
30) 129) dialog: You know, I have just as many feelings as you do and it hurts just as much when somebody steps all over them!
30) 131) text: Don't you ever...ever!  Compare yourself to me!  Okay?  You got everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin' Rapunzel, right?  School would probably fucking shut down if you didn't show up!  "Queenie isn't here!"  I like those earrings Claire.

30) 143) dialog: Not me...ever...
30) 145) dialog: What happens?
30) 152) dialog: Are we still friends, you mean? If we're friends now, that is?
30) 154) dialog: Do you want the truth?
30) 156) dialog: I don't think so...
30) 158) dialog: With all of you...
30) 160) dialog: Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came walking up to you in the hall on Monday, what would you do?  I mean picture this, you're there with all the sports.  I know exactly what you'd do, you'd say hi to him and when he left you'd cut him all up so your friends wouldn't think you really liked him!
30) 163) dialog: Same exact thing!
30) 166) dialog: Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth, that makes me a bitch?
30) 168) dialog: Okay, what about you, you hypocrite! Why don't you take Allison to one of your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or take Brian out to the parking lot at lunch to get high?  What about Andy for that matter, what about me? What would your friends say if we were walking down the hall together. They'd laugh their asses off and you'd probably tell them you were doing it with me so they'd forgive you for being seen with me.
30) 171) dialog: (furious and sobbing)
30) 174) dialog: I hate you!
30) 182) dialog: Your friends wouldn't mind because they look up to us... Brian laughs at her.
30) 184) dialog: (crying again)
30) 187) dialog: I don't know, I don't...you don't understand..you don't.  You're not friends with the same kind of people that Andy and I are friends with! You know, you just don't understand the pressure that they can put on you! Brian is shocked.
30) 196) dialog: (with pity)
30) 199) dialog: No!  Killing yourself is not an option!
33) 0) text: Andrew, Allison, Claire and Brian are sitting, in that order on the railing.
33) 1) dialog: Brian?
33) 3) dialog: Are you gonna write your paper?
33) 5) dialog: Well, it's kinda a waste for all of us to write our paper, don't you think?
33) 7) dialog: True, but I think we'd all kinda say the same thing.
33) 9) dialog: True, but, you're the smartest, right?
33) 12) dialog: We trust you... Brian glances over at Allison and Andrew who nod in approval.
33) 15) dialog: Great... Claire looks at Allison who looks back.
33) 16) dialog: (to Allison)
33) 19) dialog: Come on! We see Claire putting eye make-up on Allison.
33) 20) dialog: Don't be afraid.
33) 22) dialog: I'm not sticking it, just close... just go like that... Claire closes her eyes.  Allison mimics her.
33) 23) dialog: Good... Claire puts the make-up on her and Allison squeals.
33) 24) dialog: You know you really do look a lot better without all that black shit on your eyes...
33) 26) dialog: This looks a lot better...look up. We see Brian thinking about what he's going to write. We see Andrew just thinking. We see Allison and Claire again.  Claire is still putting make-up on Allison.

34) 9) dialog: Were you really disgusted about what I did with my lipstick?
34) 11) dialog: Truth... Bender nods and speaks at the same time.
37) 0) text: Brian gets into his dadВ’s car and leaves. Andrew and Allison kiss, Allison rips a patch off AndrewВ’s jacket and gets into the car. Andrew's dad arrives and looks at him, then at Allison. Andrew gets into the car and they drive off. We see Claire take out one of her diamond earrings and put it into Benders hand.  They kiss and she gets into her car.  She leaves. We see Bender put the earring in his ear.
