32) 14) dialog: Awes.
34) 3) dialog: I don’t know. It just sort of came naturally. Beca enters, takes in the scene and cheers up.
34) 7) dialog: Nah, we're just releasing stress.
34) 10) dialog: What is this? It’s real fancy. Chloe opens it, and the card immediately makes an “AHHHHH sound. She quickly closes it. She opens it again. The “AH happens again but doesn’t last long. Chloe reads the card

34) 15) dialog: Maybe. There’s just an address and a password.
35) 1) dialog: Anyone else scared?

52) 22) dialog: Okay, let’s regroup. Clearly we're not going to beat Das Sound Machine at their game. So we need to figure something else out. Like, now. (then) At times like these, there’s only one thing to do--
52) 24) dialog: Close. Free up your weekend, ladies. We’re going on a retreat. Ashley HITS the brakes, sending the already beat-up ladie forward. She turns around.
57) 4) dialog: Look, Aubrey told me that while her methods can be unconventional, she gets results. I mean, I’m excited to see what happens when a bunch of college girls who have lost their way are forced to work together to assemble something with their hands out in the middle of nowhere, aren’t you?

72) 12) dialog: What could be more important than this?
72) 14) dialog: You think we haven’t noticed that you've been a little checked out?
72) 16) dialog: I heard that. Tell me what? Beca shoots daggers at Fat Amy. Now Fat Amy back-pedals. (CONTINUED)
72) 21) dialog: (processing it) Okay. So why would you keep something like that from us?
72) 23) dialog: What is so wrong with being focused on the Bellas? This has been my family for seven years!
72) 26) dialog: That's... just... mean! We’re all here by choice! I thought you felt the same way!
72) 30) dialog: Oh great. So you’ve been lying to us all year and now is when you choose to flake out?! The Worlds are--

73) 19) dialog: Then it’s decided. This year I will graduate. The Worlds will be my swan song. Everyone reacts skeptically.
73) 20) dialog: I mean it. I’1l pursue my passion and teach singing lessons to under- privileged children. Or I’1l dance exotically. Whatever has the most money in it. She sits, proud of herself.
73) 42) dialog: 
73) 61) dialog: I think we did.
