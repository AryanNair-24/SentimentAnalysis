10) 43) dialog: About three months. We met at a cocktail party in London.
10) 45) dialog: No, I must admit it was not coincidence. She asked me to come, and I suppose I couldn't resist. You see I was infatu- ated with her. I'd have done any mortal thing the asked.

10) 59) dialog: What!!
10) 61) dialog: What nonsense. There's no violence in her. Besides how could she have done it? She'd never have been able to climb down that ladder to the beach - she's no head for that sort of thing at all. - And even if she could have, she was no match for Arlena. She'd have been the one to have been murdered. No, if it's jealousy you're after I'd have a go at Ken Marshall. He must be favourite. Now is that all?

28) 10) dialog: What!! Is it daft you are?
28) 12) dialog: Jesus. You re talking through your hat- POIROT shakes his head slowly. D‘you mind telling me how J did it then?

28) 20) dialog: (hotly) Now that's enough.
28) 23) dialog: If anything at all of what you're saying were true, d'you mind telling me why on earth I should kill her. Presumably there would have been plenty more where that came from.
