A WHITE MAN with a BUCKET OF WHITE PAINT daubs a number o each boy's chest. DING! DING! The boys stagger out, blindly swinging. The c roars, bangs the tables as they stumble, lurch, in the ba din. The smallest of the boys stands stiff. He struggles to th much less land a punch. The number "One" is painted on hi chest. A much bigger boy, "Number Six" punches "One" in the gut. "One" goes down but then slowly rises. The dixieland band watches the exploitation with both hor and intrigue as they can't help but wonder who will be le standing. The band's sound begins to change. It becomes as energize as the match before them. They sink into the rhythm, and effect is one of heightened energy. The drummer begins to pull the beat and the bass player instantly follows suit finding the new pocket. The drumme and bass player share a glance. This inspired pocket soars across the lawn and into the e of boy "Number One". We are now transported into the mind of "Number One". Complete silence except for the sound of the band. Then o by one all other instruments fade away leaving only the d and bass. James turns to the band and lowers his blindfold from ove one eye. He catches eyes with the drummer and bass player The drummer nods at James and smiles. James nods back and closes his eye.

They are now playing what we and Jam are hearing in his head. James covers his eye again with the blindfold and forms a slight smile. His stance becomes more relaxed. His body begins to swing and morph like rubber. He throws a punch. IT LANDS. ALL AT ONCE "Number One" dances forward, dips, swings and sweetly CONNECTS to "Number Four". As the vanquished head hits the canvas, the victor, "Number One", bloodied, pant in the waves of laughter and summer heat, stands alone. As the boys hit the deck and are deemed "out" they are pu off the mat and carried to the bed of a parked truck. "Three" goes down. Then "Two" and "Five". A ringside punt THUMPS the canvas with a fistful of dollars, berating him People screaming with laughter. Only "One" and "Six" rema Panicky, jerky, they stalk one another. Listening. "Number One" connects with lighting speed. "Six" removes blindfold, jumps off the ring and runs across the lawn disappearing into the nearby woods. "Number One" stands victorious. The crowd goes wild. "Num One" absorbs the admiration as he slowly pushes up the blindfold and looks toward the bandstand. All the band members have returned to the stand as in rea they always were. They clap wildly as the beat and rhythm this budding continues in his head. THE EIGHT YEAR OLD JAMES BROWN LOOKS RIGHT AT US. A level gaze. That million dollar smile, teeth coated with blood.
