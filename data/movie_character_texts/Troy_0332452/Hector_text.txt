8) 23) dialog: You make excellent wine in Sparta. Menelaus laughs and drinks with Hector. Paris excuses himself from the Spartan generals he's been speaking with and heads outside -- in the same direction as Helen. Hector watches with mounting agitation.
10) 0) text: As more and more wine gourds are emptied, the scene grows rowdier. An impromptu choir of Spartan and Trojan soldiers drunkenly sing battle songs. Polydora sits on Menelaus's lap. She whispers in his ear while he laughs and drains another cup of wine. Bits of roasted boar fleck his thick red beard. Hector sits nearby, half engaged in conversation with several Spartan generals. He's clearly not happy that his brother's still missing. INT. HELEN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT (LATER) il Helen lies naked on her bed. In the candlelight her flanks are mapped with copper trails of sweat. She watches Paris, who stands bedside pulling on his clothes.
11) 0) text: A group of TROJAN SOLDIERS lies on goatskins and furs around a bonfire built in the middle of the courtyard. Some sleep; some continue to drink and sing old Trojan songs. Hector stands by the fire, conferring with TECTON (30), a bull-necked captain of the elite Apollonian Guard.

11) 3) dialog: Which does the Sea God prefer? (CONTINUED)
11) 7) dialog: Paris! Paris turns, smiles and waves, acting as if he hadn't see Hector before. He ambles over to join his brother.
11) 8) dialog: You should get to bed. We won't sleep on land again for weeks.
11) 10) dialog: And who sang lullabies to you tonight? Paris freezes for a moment but quickly regains his poise.
11) 12) dialog: I hope you didn't let the fisherman catch you.
11) 14) dialog: You do understand why we're in Sparta?
11) 18) dialog: And you do understand that Menelaus, King of Sparta, is a powerful man? And that his brother, Agamemnon, King of Mycenae, commands all the Greek forces?
11) 20) dialog: Paris. You're my brother, and I love you. But if you do anything to endanger Troy I'll rip your pretty face from your pretty skull. He kisses Paris on the forehead.
11) 21) dialog: Get some sleep. We sail in the morning. Paris, a bit shocked by the encounter, stumbles away.

13) 4) dialog: Sometimes the gods bless you in the morning and curse you in the afternoon. Paris watches his brother work the wood. When Paris speaks again his tone is more sober than we've heard it before.
13) 6) dialog: What have you done now?
14) 2) dialog: Open the door. Paris opens the door. Helen, wearing a hooded robe, sits on the edge of a hammock, swinging slightly. She stands. Hector stares at her in disbelief. He turns and glares at Paris.
14) 3) dialog: If you weren't my brother I'd kill you where you stand.

17) 7) dialog: Say another word and I'll break your arm. This is all a game for you, isn't it? (MORE) (CONTINUED)
17) 10) dialog: You roam from town to town, bedding merchants' wives and temple maids - - you think you know something about love? What about your father's love? You spat on him when you brought her on this ship. What about love of your country? You'd let Troy burn for this woman. Paris starts to speak but Hector raises a warning finger.
17) 11) dialog: I won't let you start a war for her.
17) 13) dialog: To Sparta? They'll kill you.
17) 15) dialog: That sounds heroic to you, doesn't it? To die fighting. Tell me, little brother, have you ever killed a man?
17) 17) dialog: Have you ever even seen a man die in combat?
17) 21) dialog: I've killed men, brother. I've watched them dying, I've heard them dying, I've smelled them dying. (beat) There's nothing glorious about it, nothing poetic. You think you want to die for love, but you know nothing about dying. You know nothing about love.
17) 24) dialog: You already have. For a long time Hector is silent. Finally he turns to the pilot, who awaits the prince's command.
17) 25) dialog: To Troy. Hector walks away from his brother.

The city is magnificent, a wonder of white-washed walls, lush gardens, and towering STATUES of the gods. ZEUS, APOLLO, APHRODITE, and POSEIDON stand eighty feet high in the four corners of the main square. The princes' return is a holiday for the Trojans. Thousands of ONLOOKERS line the road, cheering. Other well-wishers, standing on the roofs of houses, throw flower petals. Paris holds Helen's hand and occasionally whispers in her ear, pointing out various sights, but Helen looks nervous People in the crowd, mystified by her appearance, point a her and whisper amongst themselves. Helen holds her head high and pretends to ignore the murmurs and stares. Hector looks at her. She carries herself like a queen -- but she's gripping Paris's hand with white knuckles.
28) 3) dialog: He has a good grip.
29) 2) dialog: Did you miss me, little swan? Briseis nods. Hector pinches the sleeve of her robe.
29) 3) dialog: A servant of Apollo now?
30) 4) dialog: If I'd let him fight Menelaus for her, you'd be burning a son's body instead of welcoming a daughter. Priam closes his eyes at these words.
30) 6) dialog: You know Menelaus. He'd spear your envoys! heads to his gate.
30) 8) dialog: Put her on a ship and send her home. Priam thinks for a moment, staring out at his city.
30) 10) dialog: This is my country. These are my countrymen. I don't want to see them suffer so my brother can have his prize. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
30) 15) dialog: (beat) It's not just the Spartans coming after her. By now Menelaus has gone to Agamemnon, and Agamemnon's wanted to destroy us for years. Once we're out of the way he controls the seas.
30) 17) dialog: Father. (beat) We can't win this war.
30) 19) dialog: How many battalions does the Sun God command?

43) 1) dialog: The Apollonian Guard?
43) 3) dialog: Good. Hector grabs the captain, LYSANDER, overseeing arms distribution.
43) 4) dialog: How long before the army is ready?
43) 6) dialog: How long? (CONTINUED)
43) 10) dialog: Make it sooner. We've never seen the prince in martial mode before. He looks different: eyes harder, mouth set and unsmiling.
43) 11) dialog: I want patrols to scour the countryside. Check every home, every pasture. I want every Trojan brought inside the walls. If they can't walk, carry them. Lysander bows his head. Hector walks swiftly away, followed by Tecton. Lysander and the other Trojans watch their prince with silent respect. There is no doubt who leads the city.
45) 0) text: Hector and Tecton gallop through the gate. They rein in their horses and look over the elite Apollonian Guard, eighty of Troy's finest soldiers, riding well-groomed, snorting mounts. When Hector speaks his voice is clear and steady.

65) 0) text: Hector and his men enter the temple. Eyes adjusting to the gloomy light, they gingerly advance. All is quiet. Evidence of looting is everywhere. At the back of the temple, stairs lead up to the altar room. Hector walks toward the stairs. Blood trickles down the steps. Hector raises his eyes. Achilles stands atop the staircase, both hands wrapped around the hilt of his sword, the sword point resting on the top step. He stares down at Hector. WAR CRIES explode through the temple. The Myrmidons burst from their hiding places and rush the Trojans. Hector is an obvious target. Two Myrmidons charge him, their spears leveled. If Achilles is the apotheosis of martial grace, Hector is something altogether different -- a man of ordinary gifts who has become an extraordinary warrior by dint of experience, endless training, and powerful intelligence. As the Myrmidons charge he waits. At the last moment he swings his sword, slicing both spearheads from their shafts. The Myrmidons stare at their decapitated spears. Hector doesn't give them a chance to recover. He pounces, sword flashing, and both men fall to the temple floor. Achilles watches from the top step. Hector begins running up the stairs. Achilles disappears inside the altar room. Another Myrmidon bounds up the stairs after Hector. The prince wheels about and kicks the Myrmidon in the breastplate. The soldier tumbles down the steps. Hector continues up the stairs.

67) 5) dialog: Honor? (spits) Children and fools fight for honor. I fight for my country. Hector charges. Achilles dances back, staying just out of reach. Achilles looks relaxed, almost playful.
67) 6) dialog: Fight me.
68) 1) dialog: Why did you come here? Achilles gestures at the invading flotilla.
68) 3) dialog: In a thousand years even the dust from our bones will be gone.
68) 7) dialog: You speak of war as if it's a game. But how many wives wait at Troy's gate for husbands they'll never see again?
69) 0) text: Thousands of Greek soldiers on the beach watch as the Trojans retreat, many of the archers riding behind their Apollonian saviors. Hector mounts his horse and rides back toward the city. When the Greeks see Achilles climbing onto the temple's roof they stare in awe, silent. Achilles raises his bloodied bronze sword toward the sun. The CLAMOR that erupts from the beach is deafening. Thousands of men cheering and yelling his name: Achilles! Achilles!
79) 0) text: Priam stands by the room's open archway. Beyond the city he sees his beach occupied by the tremendous Greek force.

81) 7) dialog: Are you sure? She nods, swallows hard, and closes her eyes. After a moment Hector, his eyes full of sorrow, runs his hand through her long hair.
81) 8) dialog: I need to see my brother.
81) 10) dialog: I need to speak with him.
81) 12) dialog: You think I want to fight, my love? I want to see my son grow tall. I want to see the girls chasing after him.

83) 0) text: Hector runs into the garden. He's far faster. He seizes his quarry and pulls aside the fugitive's cowl. It's Helen.
83) 1) dialog: Helen? By the light of the moon he examines her face. The stress of recent weeks has taken its toll, but the shadows beneath her eyes make her face more compelling than ever. Embarrassed by the awkwardness of their position, Hector stands and helps Helen to her feet.
83) 2) dialog: What are you doing out -- (CONTINUED)
83) 6) dialog: Where? Helen struggles against Hector's grip, but it's useless.

83) 14) dialog: No. You're not. (CONTINUED)
83) 18) dialog: It's too late for that. You think Agamemnon cares about his brother's marriage? This is about power. Not love.
83) 20) dialog: Yes.
83) 23) dialog: It's his decision.
83) 25) dialog: You're a princess of Troy. And my brother needs you tonight. Helen stares at Hector in wonder. The words seem to bolster her spirit, and she smiles though her eyes are still wet. She nods, touches his arm and goes back to the palace.
87) 0) text: Below the walls, on the broad field that stretches down from the city gates, the TROJAN ARMY has amassed. In the front, Hector and General Glaucus sit astride their horses. The soldiers are disciplined and well-outfitted, arranged in tight formation. Paris rides out to join Hector. Hector examines Paris's face.

95) 16) dialog: I've seen the limits of your mercy. And I tell you now that no son of Troy will ever submit to a foreign ruler.
95) 27) dialog: He doesn't have the stamina he once did. Make him swing and miss. He'll tire. Paris nods. He turns toward Menelaus but quickly turns back and grabs Hector's arm.
95) 30) dialog: I will.
95) 32) dialog: Think about your sword and his sword. Nothing else. (CONTINUED)
95) 38) text: It's difficult to see from inside your bronze helmet. Your peripheral vision is severely restricted, and the nose guard bisects your vision. Your breathing sounds amplified, impossibly loud and half panicked. But there's no turning back. Menelaus stands in the center of the vast battlefield, patient and menacing, carving the air with lazy strokes of his sword. You look back and see Hector. Hector nods, trying to encourage you, but he looks worried. Behind Hector is the Trojan army, twenty-five thousand silent men. Behind the army is the city of Troy. Atop those walls, beneath that blue canopy, your father is watching, and th woman you love. You turn back to Menelaus. He's smiling at you.

104) 0) text: AGAMEMNON standing on his chariot in front of his army, sees his brother fall. For a moment the vast field is silent. Agamemnon SHOUTS. A wordless cry of rage, echoing from the Greek lines to the walls of Troy. He points toward Hector. The entire Greek army surges forward. Hollering with a collective violence powerful enough to make the ground tremble, fifty thousand soldiers charge at Hector.
105) 1) dialog: Paris. Paris still seems to be in a state of shock.
105) 2) dialog: Get up. Get up! The avalanche of Greek infantry is getting closer. Paris finally gets to his feet but runs in the wrong direction, toward the Greeks.

117) 7) dialog: We're almost in range of their archers. You saw what our arrows did to them. (beat) Have the men gather our fallen. When they're done, send an emissary to the Greeks. They can collect their dead without fear of assault.

They can't breach our walls. We'll beat them back again. (beat; to Priam) Yesterday the Greeks underestimated us. We should not return the favor today. Priam meditates on this conflicting advice. He stands and paces about the room. He turns to Archeptolemus.

138) 0) text: But now the glorious bronzed figure of Achilles leaps ove the trench, sunlight reflecting off his polished armor. He raises his sword to the sky. A great, violent ROAR rises from the Greek army. When he runs toward the Trojans the Greeks jump from their positions and follow. The two armies collide. Unlike the grassy field the men fought on yesterday, today's battle takes place on the sand, and sand is everywhere. Horse hooves kick up clouds of sand. Men struggle for footing in the loose sand. Red blood puddles on the yellow sand. But much more is different than the terrain. Now the Greeks have a leader. The Myrmidons are at the forefront, battling with a ferocity most Trojans have never seen before. A Trojan OFFICER, spear raised, gallops toward the figure of Achilles. Before the Trojan can throw, Eudorus hurls his spear, catching the officer in the neck. The man goes down. Odysseus, immersed in combat, sees this. He hesitates for a moment and in his distraction is nearly cut down by an axe-wielding Trojan. They fight. After Odysseus dispatches the man, he looks back toward the glittering figure of Achilles. Something's making him uneasy. A Trojan swings his sword at the shining warrior, narrowl missing a clean decapitation. The Greek hero thrusts his spear and guts the Trojan. The Myrmidons surge forward, hacking their way through th Trojans. The Greek army steadily pushes the Trojans back, picking up more and more momentum. Now it is the Trojans who seem frightened, unsure where the Greeks found this intense spirit. Glaucus, the Trojan general, on horseback, shouts to Hector.
138) 6) dialog: (to himself) Achilles. Hector goes after him. He grips the reins and guides his horse toward the Myrmidons. His Apollonians, clustered about him protectively, move in that direction as well.

Hector abandons his mount, leaping down to the beach, running for the shining warrior. A Myrmidon intercepts him. Their battle is quick-- Hector kills him with a sword thrust. Now he is face to face (or helmet to helmet) with the figure of glorious Achilles. The two men, breathing heavily from the combat, stand still for a moment. The intricately-worked bronze of Achilles' helmet, breastplate, and shield all shine bright. He's a difficult man to stare at for long. Now he charges, sword raised. They fight. And though the battle continues all around them, everyone seems to be aware of the duel taking place The shining warrior is quicker than Hector and lighter on his feet, swinging again and again, a blaze of bronze. Hector fights patiently, parrying the blows, waiting for an opening. The sword of Achilles whistles over Hector's head, swung so hard that the man wielding it cannot protect himself. Hector takes full advantage, swinging quickly, his blade carving the soft flesh just beneath Achilles' helmet. A long question mark of blood whips out of the cut throat The man falls. (CONTINUED)

The boy doesn't see his father, he sees something terrifying, a man with a bronze face and a plum of horsehair. Scamandrius begins to CRY. Hector removes his helmet. Now the boy sees his father.
