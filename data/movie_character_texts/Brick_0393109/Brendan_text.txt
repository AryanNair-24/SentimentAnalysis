50) 61) text: Brad tags Brendan in the ribs, then smacks the palm of hi hand into Brendan's face, shoving him back onto the pavement.

52) 22) dialog: Go away.
52) 24) text: BRENDAN (CONT'D) (cont'd) Look, I can't trust you. You ought to be smart enough to know that. I didn't shake the party up to get your attention, and I'm not heeling you to hook you. Your connections could help me, but the bad baggage they bring could make it zero sum game or even hurt me, so I'm better off coming at it clean.
52) 28) dialog: I can't trust you. Brad was a sap, you weren't, you were with him and so you were playing him, so you're a player. With you behind me I'd have to tie one eye up watching both your hands, and I can't spare it.

53) 16) dialog: Yeah.
53) 20) dialog: Brad's a sap. I downed him on his field and his crew didn't bite. So now I know he's a sap and anyone who acts like he isn't is profiting by it. That's not why I roughed him, though.
53) 26) dialog: Economics. Brad's the school's biggest jake buyer, so if this Pin is behind all the selling, I just got his attention. Anyway, now's just shaking things out. Look, you know a kid around the burgh, lanky, short, shaved head, turns a black tang?
53) 30) dialog: Keep him off. And keep your specs on - I need to find that kid.
53) 33) text: Brendan hangs up and turns sluggishly.

54) 29) dialog: Uh huh.
54) 34) text: Brendan stands to go.
54) 37) dialog: (angry) I was done here three months ago. I told you then I'd give you Jerr and that was that, I'm not your inside line and I'm not your boy.
54) 41) dialog: (anger builds) You know what I'm in if the wrong yeg saw me pulled in here?
54) 45) dialog: No. And no more of these informal chats - if you've got a discipline issue with me write me up or suspend me and I'll see you at the parent conference.
54) 49) dialog: Maybe.
54) 53) dialog: Maybe. Alright, I need you off my back completely for a few weeks. There might be some heat soon.
54) 59) dialog: If I get caught like that it's curtains anyway - I couldn't have brass cutting me favors in public. I'm just saying now so you don't come kicking in my homeroom door once trouble starts.
54) 64) dialog: Sure I am. Got one more favor to ask.
55) 1) text: Gary Trueman throws Brendan out.

57) 7) dialog: I'm 9 of 10 that Kara's got him, but who knows where. I shook but she's not spilling.
57) 11) dialog: And I know enough about Kara to let that worry me. Alright, keep your specs on for him. Any other news?
57) 15) dialog: (considers this) She did, huh?
57) 19) dialog: She's tapping Kara, and Kara knows you know me.
57) 23) dialog: That's the spirit. Ask around for Dode, tail Kara again at lunch. I got knives in my eyes, I'm going home sick. I'll call you tonight.

63) 3) text: Brendan is shoved into the center of the room. Tug and hi clones slump against the surrounding walls. Brendan watch the thin figure's back. For a beat the only noise is the scratching of the thin man's pencil. Then he sighs and swivels around.

63) 10) dialog: Maybe I'll just sit and bleed at you.
63) 16) text: with a nick on its ear he can suck on. They do that. (Brendan blinks) So now you got Tugger to bring you here, which he never does, and you got me listening, so I'm curious what you've got to say that better be really, really good.
63) 18) dialog: Call Ms. Dannon in from the hall first; she oughta hear this.
63) 22) dialog: (shrugs, then slowly) I was going to make up some bit of information or set up some phony deal, anything so you'd let me walk. Then I was going to go to the vice principal and spill him the street address of the biggest dope port in the burgh.

115) 2) text: Brendan stands crookedly, hands in pockets, eyes trained the cold black horizon. A speck appears. Brendan waits fo it, bracing himself against the wind.

115) 12) dialog: What happened?

115) 18) dialog: Yeah?
115) 21) dialog: Huh.
115) 26) dialog: Yeah.
115) 31) dialog: Probably.
115) 36) dialog: (distant) Yeah I did.
115) 40) dialog: No.
115) 45) dialog: No, it's not finished. Tug pulled the trigger on Em and he got the fall, but the bulls coulda found that out without me.
115) 47) text: BRENDAN (cont'd) I set out to know who put her in the spot, who put her in front of the gun. That was you, angel.
115) 53) dialog: It was you. What, you want the whole tale? You want me to tell it to you?
115) 57) dialog: Alright, from the top. You had your fingers in Brad Bramish for appearances and to keep him buying from the Pin, who you were hooked with. Emily came to you and Brad, you saw her for what she was, an insecure little girl trying to get in. She goes on the backburner. Meanwhile maybe you're getting bored, maybe just greedy, so when the Pin scores big with the bricks you take your shot. You hook one, take half, and cut it back to size, but you cut it bad. Maybe accidentally, maybe to down the Pin's operation, doesn't matter. You put it back, but poor Frisco doses off it and lands in a coma. (voice strengthening) So now the Pin's fuming, maybe he's jealous of Brad, so he comes to Brad's crowd looking for blood, or at least a scape. You know trouble. There's going to be a war over this. And there's Emily. She trusts you. She wants in. It's duck soup.
115) 61) dialog: You frame her for the bad brick, then you cut her loose. You turn on your heel and bite her in the throat. Last week on the payphone, Pico and Alexander, she saw something she was scared of. Tug's car driving by, the Pin driving, but she wouldn't have seen the Pin. No, she was across the street, angel. She saw the passenger side. She saw you. She saw you and ran like she saw some devil.
115) 68) dialog: And she took the hit. Dode hid her away, but the Pin was on to her, tracked her down, told her to meet him, that they would make good. Gave her a time, and a place. And sent Tug. Just to get the straight. But maybe you had talked Tug up, or maybe he just blew a fuse, but Em sprung it on him that she had her kid, and he did what anyone could count on Tug doing - he hit her. She took the hit for you. You let her take it.
115) 72) dialog: That's the tale.
115) 76) dialog: You're going to tell me it's not?
115) 82) dialog: Look at me.
115) 86) text: She sobs through a tensed, straight face. Brendan holds h stare, but his eyes are distant.
115) 88) dialog: I hope it isn't. I want you to have been on my side all along, not just trying to get me under your thumb like Brad and the Pin and Tug.
115) 94) dialog: But I think you knew that meeting was going to blow up. I think that was your final play. But I hope I'm wrong. I hope everything I wrote in the note I dropped at Gary Trueman's office this morning is wrong. About your and Brad's involvement in the Pin's runnings. I hope you didn't steal the brick last night. In your purse.
115) 98) dialog: That's good. That means you didn't let me walk into a slaughterhouse. You didn't lead Tug and the Pin and their crews to the slaughter. And when Trueman reads the note, takes my cue and searches your locker, he won't find a damn thing.
117) 6) dialog: (gently) It's done.
117) 17) text: Brendan watches her go across the dark, barren field of asphalt.

117) 36) dialog: She called me a dirty word.
117) 41) dialog: As what-all.
117) 43) text: Brendan stands alone on the asphalt field, watching Laura until she reaches the end of the field and walks off behind a twisted chain linked fence.
