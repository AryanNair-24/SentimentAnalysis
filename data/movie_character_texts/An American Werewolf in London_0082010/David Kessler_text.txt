2) 7) dialog: Thanks again! He drives off.  LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry pulls away.  Surrounding them are the moors.  They put on their packs, David points to the signpost pointing towards East Proctor.
3) 2) dialog: Yes.
3) 4) dialog: Jack.
3) 6) dialog: You're not having a good time are you?
3) 8) dialog: Well, I like it here.
3) 10) dialog: Right. They walk on.
3) 12) dialog: I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
3) 14) dialog: She's a jerk.
3) 16) dialog: I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
3) 18) dialog: I don't know.
3) 21) dialog: If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
3) 23) dialog: It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
3) 25) dialog: We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade?  How many years of foreplay is that?
4) 0) text: David and Jack entering East Proctor.  It is brightly moonlit.  East Proctor consists of a few shops, all closed, a petrol pump and a pub.  East Proctor has a very small population and the place looks empty.  David and Jack enter the middle of town and look about.  The camera sees what they see.  A few shops, dark and shuttered.  Light and laughter come from the pub.
5) 2) dialog: Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb.  Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
5) 4) dialog: Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb.  Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
5) 6) dialog: A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
5) 8) dialog: I assume full responsibility.
5) 10) dialog: Shall we?
6) 0) text: The pub was apparently "modernized" sometime in the mid- fifties.  Its traditional Englishness combines with greasy stainless steel and glass.  It is populated by mostly pale young men with longish hair.  Several older men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches. Four or five are watching a chess game.  Two men are playing darts.  The conversation is loud and there is often laughter.  But there is something unsavory about these people.  A look of leanness and poverty.  They seem inbred and somehow sullen.  We establish the types and the general level of noise in the room. The door opens revealing David and Jack.  There is dead silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the strange attention.  They give each other a "what?" look, then turn to the assembled populace.
6) 1) dialog: Hello.
6) 6) dialog: (smiles)
6) 10) dialog: Well, do you have any coffee?
6) 18) dialog: Yes, please. As the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes what they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess and darts, and the boys breathe easier.
6) 20) dialog: Listen, at least it's warm in here.
6) 24) dialog: What about it?
6) 26) dialog: Maybe the owners are from Texas. The Woman brings them their tea.
6) 30) dialog: He was joking.  Thank you.
6) 34) dialog: Oh, yes, of course.
6) 47) dialog: (to Jack)
6) 51) dialog: (to Jack)
6) 55) dialog: (to Jack)
6) 61) dialog: (to Jack)
6) 73) dialog: Jack, we'd better go.
6) 76) dialog: Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
6) 80) dialog: (worried)
6) 83) dialog: Uh, thank you.
6) 86) dialog: Yes, well, thanks again.
7) 2) dialog: I don't know.  Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
7) 4) dialog: Come on, I'm freezing. They start up the road into the night.
9) 1) dialog: That was weird.  I guess leaving was the best idea.
9) 3) dialog: Well, not quite a blood- thirsty mob. They keep walking.
9) 5) dialog: I have no idea.
9) 7) dialog: I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly. There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly illuminating sheet of light over the boys' faces.  The clap of thunder follows loud and rumbling.
9) 8) dialog: Please don't rain. Downpour.  The boys are walking in a deluge.
9) 9) dialog: Of course. They walk getting soaked.
9) 11) dialog: I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you. Jack spreads his arms and sings.
11) 0) text: David and Jack are now completely out of sight from East Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet.  There is a light drizzle.  They are standing, listening.  The drizzle stops.
11) 2) dialog: I heard that.
11) 4) dialog: Could be a lot of things.
11) 6) dialog: A coyote.
11) 8) dialog: The Hound of the Baskervilles.
11) 10) dialog: Heathcliffe.
11) 12) dialog: No, but he was on the moors.
11) 15) dialog: Yeah. They are both visibly worried and walk briskly back from where they just came.  Although after a bit of fast walking they are getting nowhere.  They stop out of breath.
11) 16) dialog: We're lost. Another bloodcurdling howl.
11) 18) dialog: I don't know.  Come on.
11) 20) dialog: Anywhere!  I think we should just keep moving. A growl.  A low guttural growl comes from out of the darkness.  We stay on the boys, but we hear something out there.  It starts to walk.
11) 21) dialog: It's moving.
11) 24) dialog: What's the plan?
11) 27) dialog: (not too relaxed himself)
11) 28) text: Let's just keep walking. They do and David keeps talking as they walk.
11) 29) dialog: That's right, a lovely stroll in the moors.  Tra-la-la, isn't this fun? The thing stalking them seems to speed up.  The boys hesitate as they sense it run past them.  It stops.
11) 30) dialog: It's in front of us.
11) 33) dialog: A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away. The boys keep talking as they move faster and faster.
11) 35) dialog: Walk away, Jack.
11) 37) dialog: See anything?
11) 39) dialog: It sounds far away.
11) 41) dialog: Jack?
11) 43) dialog: Where are we going?
11) 45) dialog: Well.  I'm glad we...WHOAA!! David shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring Jack, and us, and himself a great deal.  He lays startled on the wet ground for a moment, then he and Jack laugh.
11) 47) dialog: Are you going to help me up? Jack takes David's extended hand to help him up when
12) 0) text: The lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop. David falls back on his ass.  Jack is screaming and struggling as he is torn to shreds.  David scrambles to his feet and runs in complete panic.  Jack's screams and the wolf's roars combine.
13) 0) text: David runs and runs.  Finally he falls, out of breath.
13) 1) dialog: Jack?  Oh my God, Jack! He gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody mess on the ground.  He stares in horror.
13) 2) dialog: Jack....
14) 0) text: David, dazed and bloody, looks and sees the men from The Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches running towards him.  Looking over at his attacker, instead of a wolf he sees a very old, naked man laying in the mud riddled with bullet holes.  As the villagers crowd around, David falls back and faints.
15) 0) text: David is in a small, clean and very white hospital room.  He lays on his back in bed, his shoulder bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma. There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and face, but he really doesn't look too bad.  He opens his eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look around, but is unable to because of the pain.  He calls out....
15) 1) dialog: Jack?! ...and passes out.  However his shout has fetched a nurse.  She is ALEX PRICE, very English, very beautiful.  She goes to the bed.
17) 0) text: David opens his eyes quickly, the silence and whiteness contrast sharply with the preceding fantasy.  Standing beside the bed are Dr. Hirsch and MR. COLLINS.  Mr. Collins wears a bow tie and is holding a briefcase.
17) 2) dialog: Where am I?
17) 4) dialog: London?  Where's Jack?  I had a strange dream.
17) 6) dialog: The guy I was with.  Is he all right?  How did I get to London?
17) 8) text: Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead. David jolts up in bed and shouts.
17) 9) dialog: What? The sudden exertion and strain hurt.
17) 10) dialog: Ow, shit! He sinks back down.
17) 11) dialog: Jack's dead?
17) 13) dialog: Everything's in order?  What are you talking about?
17) 15) dialog: (controlled tears)
17) 20) dialog: (shouting)
17) 21) text: Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here? Alex enters amidst David's shouting and confusion.
17) 23) text: I realize how upsetting this must be for you, Mr. Kessler, but please try to refrain from hysterics. David continues shouting and struggling.
17) 28) dialog: How long have I been here?
17) 30) dialog: Two weeks?
17) 32) dialog: (softly, as the drugs take hold)
17) 35) dialog: (softly)
17) 39) dialog: It was a wolf.
17) 42) dialog: A wolf. David passes out.  Alex looks to Dr. Hirsch.
19) 0) text: David sits up in bed.  Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus stand by his side.  Dr. Hirsch sits observing.
19) 1) dialog: I'm sorry if I conflict with your report, but Jack and I were not attacked by a man.
19) 10) dialog: There were witnesses?
19) 12) dialog: How could there have been witnesses?  It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere...I don't understand what they're talking about.
19) 14) dialog: Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
20) 0) text: Again the handheld camera is running furiously through the woods.  Heavy breathing and the sounds of the runner crashing through the foliage.  The camera runs for a while then suddenly stops short near a tree. David abruptly enters frame, animal-like, the tenseness of a startled cat.  His head makes sudden movements, looking about.
20) 2) dialog: takes off and now we run with him.  He runs fast and gracefully, taking long strides and leaps.  We run with him faster and faster sharing in his exhilaration.  We see him completely as the animal, study his movement and grace as if watching a gazelle.  Suddenly he stops again, alert, listening.  He moves with stealth, slowly he pushes some leaves aside.
20) 3) text: of his eyes. DAVID'S P.O.V. Several deer in the forest; they sense something and freeze, the camera noting a fawn next to a doe.  The buck turns his head, feeling the danger.
20) 5) dialog: Shots showing the muscles in his legs and shoulders tensing.
20) 6) text: of David's eyes.
20) 10) text: of David's eyes.
21) 0) text: The lights are subdued and David's asleep.  The door opens, a shaft of light penetrates the room.  Miss Gallagher enters with a small tray.  She crosses to David, turns on the bed light and touches him.
21) 2) dialog: (awakened)
21) 6) dialog: What time is it?
21) 8) dialog: Alex?
21) 10) dialog: What are you going to see?
21) 12) dialog: (dropping off)
21) 15) dialog: Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
25) 0) text: The curtains are drawn and David's lunch waits patiently on its tray alongside of the bed.  David is apparently asleep.  Alex enters softly.
25) 3) dialog: (lifeless)
25) 6) dialog: I'm not very hungry, thank you.
25) 8) dialog: Please, really.  I'm not hungry.
25) 10) dialog: How is that?
25) 13) dialog: Leave the pills.  I'll take them later.
25) 15) dialog: Aw come on, Miss Price!
25) 17) dialog: Aw come on, Alex!
25) 19) dialog: Call me David.
25) 21) dialog: This is absurd.  I'm not hungry.  I don't want any food.
25) 24) dialog: Will you give me a break? Alex grabs David's nose forcing his mouth open quickly, shoving the fork in it.  David is startled, but amused and chews his food slowly and swallows it.  Alex holds up another bite.
25) 26) dialog: May I have a glass of milk? Alex smiles.
26) 0) text: Again we are running fast and faster.  David again running naked, flying through the green forest.  He stops suddenly, ears perked, he looks about and then we hear Jack's o.s. screams.  The voice of Jack screams:
27) 0) text: Mrs. Hobbs hears David's screams and efficiently calls out....
28) 2) dialog: (upset)
28) 5) dialog: I've told you, it wasn't a man.  It was an animal.  A big wolf or something.  A rabid dog.
28) 8) dialog: Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart.  I saw him.  A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
28) 10) dialog: Did you see Jack?
28) 12) dialog: Did you talk to the police in East Proctor?  Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
28) 14) dialog: Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me?  You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
28) 16) text: David, please.  The police are satisfied.  I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
28) 17) dialog: You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
28) 20) dialog: Dr. Hirsch? (pause)
29) 0) text: Alex sits next to David's bed.  Her shoes are off and she has her feet tucked up under her legs on the chair. The room is dark except for the lamp by which she reads.  She is reading A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain.  David is asleep.  Alex reads for a bit, then puts down the book and yawns. She gets up and stretches, a big spreading arms and feet, fingers and toes stretch.
29) 1) dialog: (quietly)
29) 5) dialog: I was.  What are you reading?
29) 7) dialog: Do you like it?
29) 10) dialog: I dream of death mostly.
29) 12) dialog: It's okay.  I want to talk to you. They sit and look at each other for a while longer.
29) 13) dialog: How old are you?
29) 15) dialog: How old are you?
29) 17) dialog: I'm twenty-seven.
29) 19) dialog: Now what do you want to talk about?
29) 21) dialog: (seriously)
29) 25) dialog: What?  Oh, yes, please.
29) 28) dialog: (settles back)
30) 0) text: We are at David's parents' house in New York.  His FATHER sits reading the paper in the living room as his younger BROTHER and SISTER watch "The Muppet Show" on television.  We can see past the small dining nook where David sits doing homework and into the kitchen where his MOTHER is washing the dishes.  A peaceful lower, middle class setting.  All is tranquil and secure.  There is a loud pounding on the front door.
30) 3) dialog: Stop! He watches in horror as his little brother and sister scream in terror before they are brutally murdered. The monstrous Storm Troopers then set fire to the rooms.  The one holding David pulls a knife and quickly slits David's throat.
31) 0) text: David bolts upright in bed and looks around, trying desperately to gain his bearings.  He sees that Alex is asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee folded on her lap.  He makes a deliberate effort to calm himself.  He considers waking her, then decides against it.  He turns on the lamp by his bed and reaches over to take the book from Alex's lap.  David takes the book as gently as possible, but Alex wakes up anyway.
31) 3) dialog: I'm sorry I woke you up.
31) 5) dialog: No, thank you.  Just keep me company for a while.
31) 7) dialog: I keep having these really terrible dreams.  They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
31) 9) dialog: Will you come with me?
31) 12) dialog: (smiling)
31) 15) dialog: Will you think about it?
31) 17) dialog: (big grin)
31) 20) dialog: Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
31) 23) dialog: Now I'm embarrassed.
31) 25) dialog: Where were we in the book? Alex is relieved for something to break the tension.
32) 0) text: The black Orderly hustles in with David's breakfast tray, busily setting up the tray on the table over the bed.  He awakens the sleeping David with his activity.
32) 2) dialog: Good morning. He looks at his food none too happily.  He sticks a spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly.
32) 3) dialog: (in mock English accent)
32) 8) dialog: (unbelieving)
32) 11) dialog: (horrified)
32) 15) dialog: (astounded)
32) 18) dialog: (aghast)
32) 21) dialog: (resigned)
32) 24) dialog: I can't stand it.
32) 26) dialog: Rudy Levine the shmuck?
32) 28) dialog: (to himself)
32) 31) text: David!
32) 32) dialog: (louder)
32) 35) dialog: (shouting)
32) 38) dialog: If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
32) 40) dialog: (covers his ears)
32) 43) dialog: Shut up, you zombie!
32) 45) dialog: (incredulous, furious)
32) 48) dialog: Will you be quiet?! Jack rises and comes closer to David.
32) 50) dialog: What?!
32) 52) dialog: What are you talking about?  I won't accept this!  Get out! God damit!
32) 54) dialog: (quietly)
32) 57) dialog: (quietly)
32) 60) dialog: (flares up)
32) 63) dialog: (yells)
32) 66) dialog: Nurse!
32) 68) dialog: (losing it)
34) 0) text: David rocking back and forth weeping.
38) 2) text: Beware the moon, David.
38) 6) dialog: laying in bed rocking from side to side, crying softly. He is alone.  Alex rushes over, removes the tray, sits on the bed and hugs David.
38) 9) dialog: (quietly)
38) 13) dialog: I'll let you know the next full moon.
38) 15) dialog: My friend Jack was just here.
38) 17) dialog: Yeah.  He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
38) 19) dialog: I was dreaming again?
38) 21) dialog: (resigned)
39) 0) text: David and Alex walking down the street.  Alex points out her flat and leads David up the front steps.  She gives him a conspiratorial look and unlocks the door.
40) 0) text: Alex enters and David follows.  A small, utilitarian apartment, she flicks on the kitchen light.  David puts his backpack on the floor.
40) 2) dialog: Very nice. She proceeds to give the tour.
40) 4) dialog: Charming.
40) 6) dialog: Lovely.
40) 8) dialog: There is only one bed.
40) 10) text: David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower. Alex enters the room and David whistles softly, rocking on his heels.
41) 0) text: David and Alex stand facing each other under the stream of water in the shower.
41) 1) dialog: It's nice to see you.
42) 0) text: David and Alex in a passionate, orgasmic kiss in Alex's bed.  David pulls out and they lay holding each other. After a moment....
42) 1) dialog: Alex?
42) 3) dialog: Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
42) 5) dialog: (leers)
42) 8) dialog: I was awake and he was in my room.
42) 10) dialog: (firm)
42) 14) dialog: That's good, Alex.  Reassure me. Alex begins kissing David's neck.
42) 15) dialog: It's all right, I know I'm being insane. She kisses his shoulders, then his chest.
42) 16) dialog: Okay, okay.  I'm properly reassured! Alex is now kissing his stomach, her head gradually lowers from frame.  David reaches back over his head to hold onto the headboard of the bed.
42) 17) dialog: (closing his eyes)
43) 0) text: Alex is asleep holding David.  David carefully lifts her arm and gets out of bed.  He is naked.  He tiptoes out of the room and goes to the bathroom.
44) 0) text: David lifts the toilet seat and pees.  He winces, hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex.  When he's finished peeing he goes to the sink.  The medicine cabinet door over the sink is open.  When David closes it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack reflected standing behind him.  (Note: This is a big scare.)  Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him. David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes tightly and then reopens them.  Jack is still there in the mirror.  When David turns around Jack is standing in the doorway.
44) 1) dialog: (points a trembling finger)
45) 0) text: Jack sits down and motions for David to sit also.  He does.  David's conversation is in whispers, so as not to wake up Alex.
45) 1) dialog: What are you doing here?
45) 3) dialog: Okay, you've seen me.  Now go away.
45) 5) dialog: I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
45) 7) dialog: Get out of here, Jack!
45) 9) dialog: (interrupting)
45) 12) dialog: Jack, are you really dead?
45) 14) dialog: I think I've lost my mind.  I think you're not real.  I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
45) 16) dialog: What, Jack?  That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people?  Bullshit!
45) 18) dialog: (shouts)
47) 2) text: This is not pretend, David.
47) 3) dialog: (righteous)
47) 6) dialog: (triumphant)
50) 0) text: We find Alex and David in an embrace by the front door. Alex is dressed in her nurse's uniform and David has jeans and a T-shirt on.  He is shoeless and obviously not going out.  Alex pulls away.
50) 2) dialog: Do me an enormous favor?
50) 4) dialog: Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
50) 6) dialog: Werewolves simply do not exist.
50) 8) text: David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
50) 9) dialog: Yeah, I do, but go to work. He opens the door and they both go outside.
51) 1) dialog: walk to the sidewalk.  It is rather chilly.
51) 3) dialog: Okay.
51) 5) dialog: A doper werewolf. They kiss again.
51) 7) dialog: See you later. Alex goes off, turning for a last wave.  David stands looking after her when a LITTLE GIRL walking a dog passes by.  The dog, on seeing David, begins to growl and snarl.
51) 8) dialog: (to dog)
51) 10) dialog: Thanks a lot, dog. He realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back up the steps to find the door locked.
51) 11) dialog: Wonderful. Cut to shot of David's bare feet on the cold stone.  He mutters to himself, imitating a newscaster.
51) 12) dialog: An American werewolf was found frozen to death today in the heart of London, England. He looks around and sees that there is a small window ajar on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the ground, which can be reached by climbing a brick wall, which he does but not without damage to his bare toes. At the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on seeing David.  The hair stands up on its arched back and it glares at David, hissing and spitting.  David is disturbed by the cat's hostile behavior.
51) 13) dialog: What did I do, cat? The cat is really acting fierce.  When David goes to pat it cautiously, it screeches and runs away.  David is, by this time, not amused.  David manages to pull himself into the window.
52) 0) text: David awkwardly enters the bathroom through the tiny window.  Finally getting both feet on the ground, he steps to the sink and regards himself in the mirror.
52) 1) dialog: (weakly)
53) 0) text: David goes straight to the fridge and opens it.  He closes the fridge and walks into the bedroom.
55) 1) dialog: I'm not hungry. He closes the fridge and walks into the living room.
56) 0) text: David turns on the television.  On Thames is a soccer match.  On BBC 1 is some truly insipid children's program, and on BBC 2 is a soccer match.  David switches off the television. He sits on the chair nervously, drumming his fingers and humming.
56) 1) dialog: (singing)
56) 2) text: `Moon River, wider than a mile I'm crossing you in style, Someday....' David gets up, goes to the front door, and flings it open.  It is getting dark.  David views this fearfully, but still not completely convinced.  He goes back inside and we note that the front door is not completely closed.  He goes back into the bathroom and looks into the mirror.
56) 3) dialog: Fee fi fo fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. He goes back into the living room and paces round and round the room like a caged animal.
58) 0) text: David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly clutches his head in pain.
58) 1) dialog: Jesus Christ! He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor.
58) 2) dialog: (screams)
58) 4) dialog: I'm burning up!  Jesus! He rips at his shirt, tearing it off.  His body is dripping wet.
58) 5) dialog: (shouts out in pain and fear)
58) 7) dialog: Help me!  Somebody help me, please!  Jack!! David's hair is wringing wet.  He screams and grabs at his legs.
58) 8) dialog: (pleading, whimpering)
58) 9) text: I'm sorry I called you a meat loaf, Jack. New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body. He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are burning him. Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps for air. He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands. He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his torment; but it's no use.  On all fours he gives himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change. The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves, the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as claws burst forward. The camera pans up to show the full moon outside through the window.  David's moans change slowly into low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the Wolf padding off into the darkness.
71) 0) text: It is early morning and all the animals are aroused. We cut around to roaring cats, screeching monkeys, and panicky birds, etc., until we come to the Wolves' cage where we find David, naked and curled up on the ground by the cage, asleep.  David wakes up slowly.  He is completely naked, his body dirty, with several scratches on his torso and legs.  He yawns and stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks something distasteful from his teeth.  He also notices something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean them, he suddenly does a complete Stan Laurel discovering where he is.  He puts his hands over his eyes.
71) 1) dialog: Wake me up, Alex. He slowly peaks through his fingers; he's still there. He stands up and looks around. The zoo opens and women with prams and children hustle about.  David sees them coming towards him, notes his lack of clothes, and decides it would be better for all concerned if they did not meet.  He looks around for a suitable hiding place and dashes behind some bushes. He crouches down so that he can't be seen, scratching himself on a thorn.
71) 2) dialog: Ouch!
72) 0) text: Alex sits holding David's torn T-shirt.  She is trying to read her book, but is just too distracted.  The phone rings and she runs for it.
73) 0) text: David is still behind the bushes.  He looks to see if the coast is clear, then stands up and parts the bushes.  He steps out to confront a DOWAGER LADY.
73) 1) dialog: Hello.
73) 4) dialog: Excuse me, won't you? He returns to the bushes.
73) 7) dialog: Pssst! The Little Boy looks around.
73) 8) dialog: Hey, kid!  Pssst.  Little boy with the balloons. The Little Boy pantomimes, "who me?"
73) 11) dialog: Come over here. The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush replies:
73) 12) dialog: If you come over here, I'll give you a pound. The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush pleads.
73) 13) dialog: Two pounds? The Little Boy shakes his head.  The bush reasons:

73) 17) dialog: I'm the famous balloon thief.
73) 19) dialog: (losing patience)

73) 23) dialog: A little closer. When the Little Boy gets within reach, David grabs his balloons and uses them to cover his crotch.
73) 24) dialog: Thank you. David runs off through the zoo, naked but for his balloons, startling several animal lovers.
77) 0) text: in another part of town.  The camera is on the crowd of fifteen or twenty people waiting for the bus.  When the bus pulls up, they all crowd in.  The camera goes to floor level and slowly examines the footwear of the crowded bus.  Passengers are standing in the aisle and the camera slowly pans on their galoshes, boots, high heels, rubbers, etc., until it comes to rest on a conspicuous pair of bare feet.  We pan up to find David clad only in a woman's rain coat with a fur collar trying to look as nonchalant as possible.  A man looks at him oddly.
77) 1) dialog: (cheerfully)
77) 2) text: A lot of weather we've been having lately. The man studies David carefully.

78) 3) dialog: Alex, I've lost my mind.  I woke up at the zoo!  But you know what?  I feel terrific!
78) 5) dialog: Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane.  Having no clothes on?  That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
78) 7) dialog: I said goodbye to you.  I was locked out of the flat.  I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo! (big smile)

82) 11) dialog: (adamant)
83) 1) dialog: Pay the man. David gets out of the cab.

83) 6) dialog: I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right.  I....
83) 9) dialog: Jack is dead.  Look, six people have been killed.  I'm going to the police. David takes off walking briskly down the street.  Alex has to jog to keep up with him.
83) 11) dialog: Rational!?!  I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake! He strides up to a Bobbie on the corner.
83) 12) dialog: Officer, I killed those people last night.
83) 16) dialog: (dumbfounded)
83) 19) dialog: (desperate)
83) 22) dialog: Hey, you asshole!  I want you to arrest me!
83) 24) dialog: (shouts)
83) 28) dialog: Shakespeare was French!  The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell!  Shit!  Fuck!  Piss! The Bobbie takes David's arm roughly as pedestrians start to gather.

83) 32) dialog: Who is this girl?
83) 34) dialog: (frustrated, yelling)
83) 38) dialog: Will you shut up!?!!
83) 42) dialog: (disbelief)
83) 43) text: You're not going to arrest me? David approaches one of the ONLOOKERS.
83) 44) dialog: Don't you think he should arrest me?
83) 46) dialog: (despair)
83) 49) text: David.... The Bobbie has lost all patience.
83) 51) text: Nothing to look at.  Move along. The Bobbie walks away.  David is beside himself.
83) 52) dialog: Hopeless.  It's hopeless.
83) 54) text: David, let's go now. David turns in a rage.
83) 55) dialog: Leave me alone, dammit!  You people are crazy!  I've got to get away from here!  I've got to do something!
83) 57) text: David, don't lose control.
83) 58) dialog: (approaching, hysteria)
83) 60) dialog: Leave me alone! He runs out into the street.  Cars slam on their brakes, just missing him.
84) 0) text: David is running in panic.  He finally comes to rest in an alley.  He sits down and sobs uncontrollably.
85) 3) text: Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him. SGT. McMANUS
86) 0) text: David is in a telephone booth.
86) 1) dialog: Yes, operator.  I'd like to call the United States and reverse the charges.  David Kessler for anyone.  Yes, I'll wait.  Hello?  Yes, area code 315/472-3402.  Thank you. (pause)
86) 2) text: Hello?  Rachel?  Just say yes, you'll accept the charges. Just say yes, Rachel.  Is Mom or Dad home?  Where are they? Where's Max?  You're all alone?  Mom and Dad wouldn't leave me alone when I was ten. No, not ten and a half either. I'm still in London.  I'm all better.  Look, would you tell Mom and Dad that I love them? I don't care, Rachel, just do it for me.  Okay?  Good.  And, Rachel, don't fight with Max. Well, try.  Look, kid, please don't forget to tell Mom and Dad I love them.  I love Max and you, too.  Well, I do. No, I'm not being weird, you little creep.  You promise? Okay.  Be a good girl.  I love you.  Bye. He hangs up in profound depression.  Leaving the booth he sees an outdoor clock.  It is 4:15.  He sighs, then catches sight of something. 81   EXT. CINEMA - DAY - DAVID'S P.O.V. There stands Jack, now truly rotted and ghastly.  He's pretty much dried out, a third of his face gone revealing the grinning skull.  He waves to David.  Jack points inside the theater and goes in.  David smiles, walks across the intersection, and up to the box office.
86) 4) dialog: Will you take a traveler's check?
86) 6) dialog: Keep the change.
87) 0) text: A film (to be determined) plays on screen.  The small theater is mostly empty.  A few snoring BUMS and wide- eyed CHILDREN are scattered about.  Jack sits in the last row in the shadows.  He waves to David.  David goes and sits next to him.
87) 1) dialog: Hi, Jack.
87) 3) dialog: What can I say, Jack?
87) 5) dialog: Aren't you going to say, `I told you so'?
87) 7) dialog: You look awful.
87) 9) dialog: (apologizes quickly)
87) 12) dialog: Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that.  I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
87) 15) dialog: Hello.
87) 19) dialog: (horrified)
87) 22) dialog: (appalled)
87) 29) dialog: (defeated)
87) 34) dialog: That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
87) 36) dialog: (to Jack)
87) 39) dialog: How shall I do it?
87) 42) dialog: I could hang myself.
87) 50) dialog: Don't I need a silver bullet or something?
87) 52) dialog: Madness.  I've gone totally mad.
87) 56) dialog: Thank you, you're all so thoughtful. As the conversation continues, the camera pulls back from the grisly tableau.  David grabs his head suddenly.
89) 0) text: David is dripping wet and shaking violently.  Three small children, the oldest nine, stand in the aisle staring at him.
89) 1) dialog: (gasps out in anguish)
89) 2) text: Go away!  Please!  Go away! The children watch, fascinated as David's seizures grow more severe.
89) 3) dialog: (his face contorting)
