2) 4) dialog: Yes, well thank you very much for the ride, sir.  You have lovely sheep.
3) 1) dialog: Are you cold?
3) 3) dialog: Good. They walk on, finally:
3) 5) dialog: David.
3) 7) dialog: Oh, I don't know.  I mean look around.  Isn't this a fun place? The camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold, foreboding.
3) 9) dialog: I'm sorry.  Northern England first, Italy later.
3) 11) dialog: Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
3) 13) dialog: Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
3) 15) dialog: You're talking about the woman I love.
3) 17) dialog: Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
3) 19) dialog: (like an announcer)
3) 20) text: Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe!  See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit!  See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican!  Never has the screen dared....
3) 22) dialog: I have to make love to her. It's very simple.  She has no choice really.
3) 24) dialog: It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
3) 26) dialog: She says she `likes me too much'. David just laughs and laughs and laughs.
4) 0) text: David and Jack entering East Proctor.  It is brightly moonlit.  East Proctor consists of a few shops, all closed, a petrol pump and a pub.  East Proctor has a very small population and the place looks empty.  David and Jack enter the middle of town and look about.  The camera sees what they see.  A few shops, dark and shuttered.  Light and laughter come from the pub.
5) 1) dialog: The Slaughtered Lamb?
5) 3) dialog: That's a wolf's head.
5) 5) dialog: That's not a spear.  It's a pike.
5) 7) dialog: David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
5) 9) dialog: Okay.
6) 0) text: The pub was apparently "modernized" sometime in the mid- fifties.  Its traditional Englishness combines with greasy stainless steel and glass.  It is populated by mostly pale young men with longish hair.  Several older men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches. Four or five are watching a chess game.  Two men are playing darts.  The conversation is loud and there is often laughter.  But there is something unsavory about these people.  A look of leanness and poverty.  They seem inbred and somehow sullen.  We establish the types and the general level of noise in the room. The door opens revealing David and Jack.  There is dead silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the strange attention.  They give each other a "what?" look, then turn to the assembled populace.
6) 2) dialog: Nice to see you.
6) 8) dialog: Do you have any hot soup?
6) 12) dialog: Hot chocolate?
6) 14) dialog: Then you have some hot tea?
6) 16) dialog: Oh.
6) 19) dialog: Nice looking group.
6) 21) dialog: Look at that.
6) 25) dialog: It's a five-pointed star.
6) 27) dialog: (to Woman)
6) 35) dialog: Right, with Laurence Harvey and everybody died in it.  It was very bloody.
6) 45) dialog: (to David)
6) 49) dialog: (to David)
6) 53) dialog: (to David)
6) 59) dialog: (to David)
6) 68) dialog: Excuse me, but what's that star on the wall for? Dead silence.  A dart lands in the wall.  David and Jack are understandably bewildered.  The villagers look hard indeed.
6) 71) dialog: I'm sorry.
6) 74) dialog: What do you mean?  I'm starving.
6) 77) dialog: Apparently so. The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly for the door.
7) 1) dialog: What the hell was that all about?
7) 3) dialog: Beware the moon?
9) 2) dialog: I don't know.  Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood- thirsty mob.
9) 4) dialog: What do you think was wrong?
9) 6) dialog: Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
9) 10) dialog: Say, David....
9) 12) dialog: Santa Lucia...Santa Lucia.
11) 0) text: David and Jack are now completely out of sight from East Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet.  There is a light drizzle.  They are standing, listening.  The drizzle stops.
11) 1) dialog: Did you hear that?
11) 3) dialog: What was it? David begins to walk, Jack with him.
11) 5) dialog: Yeah?
11) 7) dialog: There aren't any coyotes in England.
11) 9) dialog: Pecos Bill.
11) 11) dialog: Heathcliffe didn't howl.
11) 13) dialog: It's a full moon, `beware the moon'. Another howl, this one long and loud.  It is a very inhuman noise, terrifying, and closer this time.
11) 14) dialog: I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
11) 17) dialog: Shit!  David, what is that?
11) 19) dialog: Come on, where?
11) 22) dialog: It's circling us. And indeed it is.  The boys strain to hear its four footfalls and they turn slowly, following it.  A snarl.
11) 23) dialog: Fuck. We hear the wolf-monster stop (for that's what it is - we know it's there even though we've not seen it).  It sits breathing heavily.
11) 25) dialog: (nervously)
11) 31) dialog: Do you think it's a dog? Jack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them. BOYS' P.O.V. Something is waiting in the darkness.  Its hulking shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily and its breath is visible.
11) 32) dialog: Oh shit.  What is that?
11) 34) dialog: Nice doggie.  Good boy.
11) 36) dialog: Walking away, yes, sir.  Here we are walking away. They are in a full-out run by now.  After a few minutes flight they stop, panting.
11) 38) dialog: No. A moment of quiet, then a howl.
11) 40) dialog: Not far enough.  Come on. They walk briskly.
11) 42) dialog: Yeah.
11) 44) dialog: I'll tell you when we get there.
11) 46) dialog: You really scared me, you shithead.
12) 0) text: The lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop. David falls back on his ass.  Jack is screaming and struggling as he is torn to shreds.  David scrambles to his feet and runs in complete panic.  Jack's screams and the wolf's roars combine.
12) 1) dialog: Jesus fuck!  David!  Please help me!  Please!  David! Shit!  Help me!  Oh God!
17) 16) text: You don't crate and ship Jack like some side of beef. (approaching hysteria)
17) 17) text: Who the hell are you people? What's going on here?  Where is Jack?  I demand to see him!
26) 0) text: Again we are running fast and faster.  David again running naked, flying through the green forest.  He stops suddenly, ears perked, he looks about and then we hear Jack's o.s. screams.  The voice of Jack screams:
26) 1) dialog: David!  David!  Please help me!  Oh God!  David!  Oh my God! David turns in blind panic, he runs (and we run with him) desperately trying to find the source of Jack's screams. He comes to a clearing in the woods, light streaming through the tall trees.  Jack's screams halt in mid- word.  David looks in disbelief at the clearing.  There is a hospital bed with someone in it.  It is the same as David's. David walks toward it slowly.  The figure in the bed lays still.  It grows dark, very dark, and David looks up at the full moon.  There is a howl identical to the one heard earlier back on the moors.  David approaches the bed slowly, fearfully.  We hear ocean noises on the soundtrack, the sound of crashing surf.  David reaches out to pull back the covers, lightning and thunder cause him to hesitate for a second.  Silence.  The camera remains on David as he pulls off the covers. His face registers total disbelief and increasing horror. We cut to the bed to find - DAVID.  He lies there, pale white with purple lips and death pallor. The camera begins to move in on the corpse of David. Cut back to the standing David's terrified face; then continue until David's death mask fills the screen. The face remains still for several beats, then suddenly opens its bright yellow eyes and red mouth revealing fangs in a bloodcurdling wail which carries over in the....
32) 4) text: Please, sir, I want some more. He settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his toast and drink his juice.  While he eats, we hear Jack's o.s. voice.
32) 5) dialog: Can I have a piece of toast? David looks over to the o.s. Jack.  Jack, behaving relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by Alex.  However, Jack's appearance makes his casual manner all the more surreal.  He is as we left him butchered on the moors.  He is covered with dried mud and open wounds.  Huge glistening gashes abound on his body.  His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn, and his hair is matted with blood.  In several spots he has already begun to rot.  He is a remarkably gruesome sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him at all.
32) 6) dialog: (pleasantly)
32) 9) text: Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
32) 10) dialog: Thanks a lot.
32) 13) dialog: I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me. Jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David's tray as David watches amazed.  Jack returns to his seat and takes a bite out of his toast.  David stares at Jack horrified.
32) 14) dialog: David!  You're hurting my feelings.
32) 17) dialog: I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
32) 20) dialog: Yeah.  Your parents came to my funeral.  I was surprised at how many people came.
32) 23) dialog: Debbie Klein cried a lot.
32) 25) dialog: So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
32) 27) dialog: Life mocks me even in death. Jack takes another bite of toast.
32) 30) dialog: (loud)
32) 34) dialog: David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
32) 37) dialog: I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here.  You've got to know.
32) 39) dialog: We were attacked by a werewolf.
32) 42) dialog: On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
32) 44) dialog: I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
32) 47) dialog: The wolf's bloodline must be severed.  The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
32) 49) dialog: It's you, David.
32) 51) dialog: You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
32) 53) dialog: Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? `Beware the moon.'
32) 55) text: Stop it, Jack.
32) 56) dialog: Beware the moon.  The full moon, David.  You've got two days.
32) 58) text: Jack, please go away.  Please go away.
32) 59) dialog: You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
32) 62) dialog: David, please believe me.  You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
32) 65) dialog: Listen to me!  Take your own life, David.  It's our only chance.
32) 67) dialog: The supernatural!  The powers of darkness!  It's all true. Take your own life!  Suicide, David.  Join me.
32) 70) dialog: It's cold, David, and I'm so alone.  The undead surround me.  Have you ever talked to a corpse?  It's boring!  I'm lonely!  Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
34) 1) dialog: Don't cry, David.
36) 1) dialog: Please don't cry.
38) 1) dialog: (softly in looming closeup)
44) 0) text: David lifts the toilet seat and pees.  He winces, hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex.  When he's finished peeing he goes to the sink.  The medicine cabinet door over the sink is open.  When David closes it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack reflected standing behind him.  (Note: This is a big scare.)  Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him. David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes tightly and then reopens them.  Jack is still there in the mirror.  When David turns around Jack is standing in the doorway.
44) 3) dialog: Don't be an asshole, David. Come here. David, clearly troubled, follows Jack into the living room.
45) 0) text: Jack sits down and motions for David to sit also.  He does.  David's conversation is in whispers, so as not to wake up Alex.
45) 2) dialog: I wanted to see you.
45) 4) dialog: David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
45) 6) dialog: Yes.
45) 8) dialog: David, tomorrow night is the full moon.  You'll change, you'll become....
45) 11) dialog: You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
45) 13) dialog: What do you think?
45) 15) dialog: You must believe me.
45) 17) dialog: The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood!  God damit, David, please believe me!  You'll kill and make others like me!  I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again!  You must take your own life!
47) 1) dialog: (quietly)
58) 6) text: Jack!?  Where are you now, you fucker!?! As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in anguish.
58) 9) text: I'm sorry I called you a meat loaf, Jack. New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body. He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are burning him. Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps for air. He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands. He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his torment; but it's no use.  On all fours he gives himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change. The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves, the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as claws burst forward. The camera pans up to show the full moon outside through the window.  David's moans change slowly into low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the Wolf padding off into the darkness.
83) 8) text: Jack is dead!
86) 2) text: Hello?  Rachel?  Just say yes, you'll accept the charges. Just say yes, Rachel.  Is Mom or Dad home?  Where are they? Where's Max?  You're all alone?  Mom and Dad wouldn't leave me alone when I was ten. No, not ten and a half either. I'm still in London.  I'm all better.  Look, would you tell Mom and Dad that I love them? I don't care, Rachel, just do it for me.  Okay?  Good.  And, Rachel, don't fight with Max. Well, try.  Look, kid, please don't forget to tell Mom and Dad I love them.  I love Max and you, too.  Well, I do. No, I'm not being weird, you little creep.  You promise? Okay.  Be a good girl.  I love you.  Bye. He hangs up in profound depression.  Leaving the booth he sees an outdoor clock.  It is 4:15.  He sighs, then catches sight of something. 81   EXT. CINEMA - DAY - DAVID'S P.O.V. There stands Jack, now truly rotted and ghastly.  He's pretty much dried out, a third of his face gone revealing the grinning skull.  He waves to David.  Jack points inside the theater and goes in.  David smiles, walks across the intersection, and up to the box office.
87) 0) text: A film (to be determined) plays on screen.  The small theater is mostly empty.  A few snoring BUMS and wide- eyed CHILDREN are scattered about.  Jack sits in the last row in the shadows.  He waves to David.  David goes and sits next to him.
87) 2) dialog: Hi, David. They sit for a while watching the screen.
87) 4) dialog: You don't have to say anything.
87) 6) dialog: If I was still alive, I probably would.
87) 8) dialog: Thank you.
87) 11) dialog: What about the zoo?
87) 13) dialog: I want you to meet some people. Sitting down the row from Jack is a man, GERALD BRINGSLY, completely in the shadow.
87) 14) dialog: David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
87) 16) dialog: Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway.  We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
87) 20) text: Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
87) 26) dialog: David, this is Harry Berman and his fiancee Judith Browns. The two victims lean forward from their seats next to Mr. Bringsly.  We can just make out that Harry has one arm missing.
87) 27) dialog: And these gentlemen are Alf, Ted, and Joseph. The Three Derelicts sit next to Harry and Judith.  All are slick in the darkness, the light from the screen illuminating their gore.
87) 31) dialog: Suicide.
87) 38) dialog: Because this must be stopped.
87) 43) dialog: If you did it wrong, it would be painful.  You'd choke to death.
87) 45) dialog: Do you mind?  The man's a friend of mine.
87) 51) dialog: Be serious, would you? David puts his head in his hands.
