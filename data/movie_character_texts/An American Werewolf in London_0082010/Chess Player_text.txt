6) 42) dialog: All right, laugh then.  I shan't tell it.
6) 44) dialog: No.  You've had your chance. The men all coax him to tell the joke.

6) 63) dialog: Here now, let me finish!  So halfway over the ocean the engines run low on petrol so they have to lighten the plane.  So they heave out all the baggage, but it's still too heavy.

49) 15) dialog: Oh, yes, yes. Dr. Hirsch points to the pentangle on the wall.
49) 22) dialog: Are you a police officer?
49) 24) text: No, no, hardly.  I work in the hospital where the Kessler boy was brought. The Dart Player and Chess Player exchange a look.
