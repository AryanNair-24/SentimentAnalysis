10) 13) dialog: (steely) That would lead to a lot of awkward questions.
10) 14) dialog: (flicking through) What were you planning to tell them? That their kit didn’t work? That you were being followed? He leans forward.

10) 32) dialog: (on his feet also) You went back to your mother’s place, took your son into your arms and cried until it was time to leave.

Tonight, we put out a blurred grab from the cameras in the train station. Your friends in Belfast will guess it’s you, but it’s vague enough for us to be excused making an ID. That’s your cover. You escaped from the train station, went to ground and hid out overnight. We’ll go through your movements step by step. No answer. MAC. Have you got that, Collette? She nods, but without meeting his eye.
17) 2) dialog: Are you sure you want to do this? No answer. MAC. I need to hear you say it.

27) 4) dialog: I told her I--
27) 6) dialog: Something new. I’ve just--
27) 8) dialog: I can’t talk about it, love. You know that. It’ll take a few months, then--
27) 10) dialog: I’ll try. He’s not convincing. And its complicated.
27) 12) dialog: (hesitates) I don’t know. Not the answer she wanted.
27) 14) dialog: Hold on a second. Don’t go away. He puts the receiver down on the desk and goes to pick up the other line.
27) 16) dialog: Yeah.

35) 10) dialog: What’s he going to do about it?

35) 26) dialog: What did he ask you?
35) 29) dialog: Did he know you were in England?
35) 31) dialog: (sighs) Mulgrew’s a cunning piece of shit. He may not come at you right away. So be ready. They wait.
35) 32) dialog: It’s time to go. She continues to gaze out at the black night. She doesn’t want to go. She shivers. He reaches out and closes his hand around her's. A moment. Something here. She does not meet his gaze. COLLETTE steps out and walks rapidly away into the darkness. She does not look back.

37) 4) dialog: I’ve just got a call to--
37) 6) dialog: (incredulous) You want the SAS hiding out in his garden?

37) 9) dialog: If you do that, our player is finished. Silence.
37) 11) dialog: You lay an ambush and there’1ll be the mother and father of all witch-hunts. We might as well publish the name in the fucking Belfast Telegraph.

47) 1) dialog: Jesus! He pushes her head roughly down, so she is out of view, a accelerates away. He takes a roundabout at sixty. Roars up the hill out of town. As soon as he turns off the main road, onto a dirt track, she PUNCHES him. Smack into the face. Hard. He raises an arm for protection, slams on the brakes, ski to a halt. She’s going at him now, punching, scratching...
47) 2) dialog: For God's sake! He takes hold of both her arms.

47) 6) dialog: What did he say?
47) 8) dialog: Mac?
47) 10) dialog: (watching rivulets of rain run down the windscreen) It’s his job to make you think he knows.

47) 13) dialog: We can’t take you out. Not yet. 69. Silence.
47) 15) dialog: And it isn’t. You made a small mistake. You'll say that I introduced myself as Mr Jenkins, but I was with a colleague who referred to me consistently as Mac. She thinks about this.
47) 16) dialog: Remember who you are. Remember where you’ve come from and what you've done. One mistake doesn’t make you a tout.
47) 18) dialog: No.
47) 20) dialog: I’m here for you. Day and night. Waiting. Watching. If I think you're at risk, we'll take you out. A long silence. CLOSE ON COLLETTE. Doubt. Fear. But a yearning to trust him. To anchor herself. She didn’t know how much she wanted to begin again. She nods. She accepts. She’s his girl now. 70.
47) 28) dialog: You giving Barry Delavine a medal? FLETCHER smiles, shrugs. She’s not going to be drawn.

Chaos -- shouts -- people cowering -- screaming. What the fuck is happening? Boom! 75. SPIN AROUND. In the side street where MAC is standing -- barely fifty yards behind him -- a couple of guys in balaclavas are throwing home-made pipe bombs over the top of the cops and into the crowd. They’re shouting; up the UFF! Up the UFF! Loyalists. Protestant paramilitaries from the other side the wall. Men who claim to be fighting a covert war to protect the integrity of the British state against the IR which would like this territory to be reunited with the rest of Ireland.
52) 2) dialog: Get back! They keep coming. Slowly. With menace. The cops are tryin to push them away, but they want this guy bad. Voices. Yo lookin' after your Proddy friends? Bastards!

54) 30) dialog: Why have you locked the Henderson file? KATE shrugs, like she doesn’t know what MAC is talking about.
54) 32) dialog: My Dad had an old saying; if it looks like a dog and barks like a dog, it’s a fucking dog.
54) 34) dialog: Barry Delavine works the same side of the street. So if you were pumping his hand, it must have been because he had another angle on Henderson. Another angle means another tout. KATE FLETCHER looks at him. She really doesn’t want to go here.
54) 35) dialog: Collette McVeigh was your idea. So I’m asking myself; why?
54) 37) dialog: I spend eight months reeling her in and you’re prepared to burn her on day one. Why?
54) 39) dialog: I’1l tell you why; because you already have another agent in place. Someone close to her; bigger, better. Mulgrew and his friends started sniffing around, so you needed someone you could feed them if they get too close. She's grim-faced now.
54) 42) dialog: You cannot--
54) 44) dialog: (leaning forward) You think we can win anything if we're that cynical?
54) 46) dialog: There are no winners here, Kate. There never have been. And there never will be.
54) 48) dialog: Even you can’t believe it’s that simple. They stare at each other. Both right, both wrong. 86.

56) 40) dialog: (steely) We've been over this. It’s not going to end like--
56) 42) dialog: What was Gerry doing with Fox?
56) 43) dialog: Collette, we’re under pressure here. You’ve got to give me more than this.
56) 45) dialog: Or this isn’t going to fucking work.
56) 47) dialog: What?
56) 49) dialog: When?
56) 51) dialog: In London?
56) 53) dialog: But he wants you to go with him? 94.
56) 55) dialog: What about Paddy? She shrugs.
56) 56) dialog: And you said you would? No answer.
56) 57) dialog: (quieter) You have to go with him, Collette.
56) 59) dialog: There’s no choice. You gave up the right to... She suddenly breaks free again, runs up a set of stairs a all the way along the first floor. He catches her by a broken window, which affords a panoramic view of the city
56) 61) dialog: No, you’re not. Stay close to Gerry and see this through and you're out. I give you my word. She shakes her head.
56) 63) dialog: Anywhere you want.
56) 65) dialog: Collette, there’s a better life out there. 95. He takes hold of her arm.
