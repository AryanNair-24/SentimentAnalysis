Jacinta and Paqui sing the song while they scrub the clothes on the wooden washboards. Salvador looks at his mother in profile, with her skin gleaming with sweat, a straw hat and a headscarf to tie back her hair and protect her from the sun. Jacinta smiles back at the child as she sings. The soap, made at home from fat left over from cooking, doesn’t produce foam but it leaves (non-contaminating) lumps on the surface of the water. For the little fish, the lumps are delicious and they come up to the surface in little shoals. The child studies that natural fishbowl, fascinated, and chases after them with his stick.
