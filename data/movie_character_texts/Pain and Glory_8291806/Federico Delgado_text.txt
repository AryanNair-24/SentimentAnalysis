Stuck in the edges of the mirror are lots of photos of Alberto, unrecognizable because of the respective make-up and costumes. Half of the space in the dressing room is taken up by a mixture of bits and pieces from the theater, remains of other plays. On the walls there is the poster for Taste and one for Hamlet in its theatrical version. Federico accepts the invitation and sits across from Alberto, who covers himself with a maroon colored dressing gown.

He has hidden the paper of heroin at the back, camouflaged among the medicines, perhaps it’s in a cassette tape. He prepares a little line of heroin on top of the chest of drawers. He hesitates, he thinks about what he’s doing. He thinks better of it and ends up blowing the line away, its contents hang in the air for an instant and disintegrate before they reach the floor. He chooses the clothes he’s going to wear. A shirt and pants. He puts them on the bed. Cut. He’s dressed now.
