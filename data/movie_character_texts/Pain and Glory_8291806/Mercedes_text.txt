0) 7) dialog: But someone has to reply about the retrospectives, the tributes, the exhibitions. Your films are still alive in the world, Salvador. (And let me remind you that so are you.) 2. HOTEL MIGUEL ANGEL. SWIMMING POOL. INT. DAY. (The film could start here) The heated pool is empty. We discover Salvador totally submerged in the water and completely motionless, his knees slightly bent and his arms outstretched, as if supported by invisible armrests. (Underwater shot.) Weightlessness keeps him in this posture. He just has to control his breathing. It’s the most similar sensation to being bodiless. His head slowly emerges, only as far as his neck, the rest of his body remains motionless in the same posture. He keeps his eyes closed, he breathes steadily. His head submerges again. In this position his body doesn’t suffer any muscular’ tension. Neck, back shoulders, knees, the lumbar region, all stiffness disappears. As he doesn’t feel his body, his mind, volatile, is like an open window through which the light and the evening breeze enter. Undoubtedly, the most pleasant sensation of the day.

He takes a puff on a heroin cigarette that he has already prepared. He opens the bedroom window to air the room. Then after one puff he stubs it out. 63. SALVADOR’S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. INT. DAY. He goes back to the living room. The sunlight reflects on the waxed wooden floor, and rebounds, transformed into a powerful ray, on a level with Salvador’s head as he sits at the table. He puts on dark glasses and looks at some of the invitations. The figure of Mercedes is silhouetted against one of the large windows that lead out to a terrace.

FAMILY CAVE. INT. DAY. Jacinta, the town’s pious woman and Salvador-child are sitting in the sunlit patio, surrounded by plants. The cave is spotless despite the scarcity of furniture. Three chairs and a round table. The pious woman drinks some fresh orange juice. Jacinta offers her some madeleines from her village. She and the boy are also drinking juice.

BEDROOM AND BATHROOM. INT. NIGHT. He comes into his room. Urgently, he takes the paper of heroin from the back of the chest of drawers. He puts it on the top and looks at it with delight. He takes it, throws it down the toilet and flushes the cistern. 104. SALVADOR’S HOUSE. KITCHEN. INT. NIGHT. On the worktop in the kitchen, under the painting by Dis Berlin, Salvador gets ready to crush five different colored tablets. In a close-up we see the tablets, which are already covered by transparent paper. In the same shot, a psychopath-sized knife, the phone and a liter-bottle of liquid yogurt. Salvador takes the knife and crushes the tablets with the handle. When he has reduced them to a powder, or almost, he calls Mercedes and puts the phone on speaker. He is giving the last blows to the tablets when Mercedes’ voice comes over the phone.

The gastroenterologist did an endoscopy and he found a lump that is pressing on his esophagus. That’s why he chokes so easily. (She touches her neck) And... we don’t know what that lump is. The doctor stops writing.

0) 604) dialog: Sit down, I’1ll change the sheets. Mercedes looks at a rosary on top of one of the bedside tables, next to a photo of Salvador’s parents. Salvador sits in his mother’s wing chair. He looks at the bedside table. There is a rosary spread out deliberately, a framed photo of his paternal grandparents and also a photo of his mother, Jacinta, aged 30. And another of her with his father under several strings of recently made chorizos and blood sausages. On a lower shelf of the bedside table there is a tin box, different from the one we saw in 1960, but the same kind (where the mother kept her personal mementoes) . The sequence ends with an insert of the photos and the rosary on the bedside table. 110. SALVADOR’ S HOUSE. GUEST ROOM AND MOTHER’S ROOM.
