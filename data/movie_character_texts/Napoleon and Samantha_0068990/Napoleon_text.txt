46) 1) dialog: There is no man more cautious than I am when planning a campaign. I exaggerate all the dangers, and all the disasters that might occur. I look quite serene to my staff, but I am like a woman in labor. Once I have made up my mind, everything is forgotten, except what leads to success. A cloud of sharp-shooters, some mounted, some on foot, advance to harass the enemy, escaping from his superior numbers, by their mobility, and from his cannon by their dispersal. Napoleon studies this exchange of fire to better understa the enemy's position. Surrounded by his entourage, he is a wooded platform constructed in the top branches of a la tree, overlooking the battlefield.
46) 2) dialog: The art of war is a simple art. Everything is in the execution. There is nothing vague in it. It is all common sense. Theory does not enter into it. The simplest moves are always the best. 38. When the French skirmishers finally reveal a chink in the enemy position, it becomes a focal point for the main eff Horse artillery are sent forward, on the gallop, to open with canister at close range. The main attacking force of infantry are then sent forwar moving up in columns and lines. The cavalry trots beside them, in the gaps, to make their presence felt where it will be best used. Drummers and bands fill the air with stirring music. Officers march smartly alongside their men. The precision of these attacking maneuvers is very import because the sight of the slow moving, perfectly aligned m of infantry is more frightening and discouraging to the defender than a wild bayonet charge. When the two main forces are about 100 yards apart, the Commanding Officer in the field starts the chant "Hymn to Victory" and places his hat, with its large tricolored cockade, on the point of his sword so that is can be seen all of his troops. When the distance narrows to about 50 yards, the defendin Austrians fire their first volleys -- first row, second r third row. The French fall everywhere, but the remainder fill in the formation and keep moving in regular step. This is the crucial point of the battle. The defenders no have to decide whether they are going to run or face the attackers' volley and subsequent bayonet charge. There is time for the defenders to reload. Now the French are 20 yards away and still hold their fir trained to do this because their psychological advantage lost once they have discharged their muskets. They want t defenders to break and run. Now panic has begun to set in and to dislodge the defendi Austrian troops. They start to give way. The French relentlessly move forward. The Austrian movements at the rear become a stampede. The officers signal with their swords, and the drummers b the charge. The sky rings with a thousand battle cries. 39. The cavalry dashes forward and hacks down the fleeing Austrian infantry, who are virtually helpless against the cavalry out in the open. The French have won the day, and their infantry fires the first volley at the backs of the fleeing Austrian troops.

Outside the square, the shrieking mamelukes recklessly charge, and are slaughtered by the disciplined and accura wall of French muskets. The scene will be shot only from inside the square, and f this vantage point, all we can see, over the heads of the defending French troops and clouds of dust, are the tops the mamelukes. Napoleon, pleased with the way things are going, rides ov to the groups of scientists, to cheer them up. He has to shout to be heard.

55) 18) dialog: I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
55) 20) dialog: All right, thank you. Please ask him to come here. Junot pauses and then speaks with exaggerated importance earnestness brought on by too much drink.
55) 22) dialog: Certainly.
55) 24) dialog: Why not?
55) 26) dialog: What are you talking about?
55) 28) dialog: That's all you can say? What are you talking about?
55) 30) dialog: Now, just a minute. You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
55) 32) dialog: Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
55) 34) dialog: You mean about my wife?! You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?! Suddenly, Junot buries his head in his hands.
55) 35) dialog: What the hell is the matter with you?
55) 37) dialog: Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now. Do you understand?!
55) 39) dialog: Yes.
55) 41) dialog: What?
55) 43) dialog: You wrote it.
55) 45) dialog: You couldn't face telling me what?
55) 47) dialog: What was there to tell?
55) 49) dialog: Do you know what you're saying?
55) 51) dialog: How do you know?
55) 53) dialog: How do you know? Junot pulls himself together and speaks in an unnaturally controlled and somewhat mechanical way.
55) 55) dialog: Yes? Junot searches for a better way to say it but doesn't com with anything.
55) 57) dialog: You could hear them?
55) 59) dialog: You mean you heard them making love? 51.
55) 61) dialog: How did you know it was Captain Charles?

Napoleon is seated bef the five Directors, Barras, Sieyes, Moulins, Gohier and R Ducos, who are dressed in their pompous official costumes with three-foot hats and feathered plumes. Present also a Talleyrand, Fouche, Joseph, Lucien and several dozen important officials.
57) 1) dialog: Nelson's victory at Aboukir quite effectively finished the strategic purpose of the campaign, and with the loss of all our principal fighting ships, the army was marooned in Egypt, and our communications with the continent were severed. The only options remaining to me were to develop the occupation of Egypt, to maintain the morale of my army, and to respond to the threats being created by the English and, very soon, the Turks. This was accomplished, culminating in my final victory against the Turks, when they attempted a landing at Aboukir.
57) 3) dialog: Citizen Gohier, my army was not abandoned -- it was left in a very strong position, and in the capable hands of General Kleber.
57) 5) dialog: After the defeat of the Turks, a negotiation to arrange the exchange of prisoners took place aboard Sir Sidney Smith's flagship. At the end of the first meeting, Sir Sidney gave my chief negotiator, General Marmont, several German newspapers, of a fairly recent date. Pause.
57) 6) dialog: Now, you must bear in mind that for more than a year I had received no news at all from Europe, not a newspaper or a single mail packet. Perhaps you can imagine my state of mind when I read of the serious defeats that had been inflicted upon France during my absence: the loss of Italy, the Anglo-Russian army's occupation of Holland, the imminent invasion of France herself. After several days of deliberation, it seemed clear to me that it was my duty to risk the English blockade and, with a few small ships, attempt to return, to serve my country in any way that might be possible. Narration starts over Napoleon's dialogue which fades und

58) 13) dialog: Well, you shall see.
58) 15) dialog: I have no idea. Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is. But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.

59) 20) dialog: Not in the least. After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy. Josephine presses against him.

Roger-Ducos pokes at it with a damp log. Joseph Bonaparte stands, gazing out of the window at the troops, sprawled on the grass. There is a knock at the door.

69) 9) dialog: Come in.
69) 11) dialog: Let me have it. The officer hands Napoleon an envelope and exits. Napoleo looks at the note and, then, reads it aloud.
69) 12) dialog: My dear Bonaparte, if you have not already done so, I urge you to press things to a conclusion. I cannot guarantee the situation for very much longer in Paris. Sieyes, in an absolute panic, leans over and whispers to Roger-Ducos.

75) 0) text: The Coronation. At the moment when the Pope reaches for t crown of Charlemagne, to take it from the altar, Napoleon takes it, and, with his own hands, places it on his head. Napoleon looks, with an air of pride and satisfaction, at Josephine, as she advances towards him, at the altar, and when she kneels down, tears fall upon her clasped hands, raised to heaven -- or, rather to Napoleon.
75) 2) dialog: Duroc, I have a bill here for francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs. The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
76) 0) text: Candlelight, silver service -- beautiful women, important guests. Napoleon and Josephine are seated at opposite end of a long table. Placed at Napoleon's elbow is the strikingly beautiful Madame Trillaud, a sexy brunette. He speaks to her husband. Dessert is being served.
76) 1) dialog: The revolution failed because the foundation of its political philosophy was in error. Its central dogma was the transference of original sin from man to society. It had the rosy vision that by nature man is good, and that he is only corrupted by an incorrectly organized society. Destroy the offending social institutions, tinker with the machine a bit, and you have Utopia - - presto! -- natural man back in all his goodness. Laugher at the table. 69.
76) 2) dialog: It's a very attractive idea but it simply isn't true. They had the whole thing backwards. Society is corrupt because man is corrupt -- because he is weak, selfish, hypocritical and greedy. And he is not made this way by society, he is born this way -- you can see it even in the youngest children. It's no good trying to build a better society on false assumptions -- authority's main job is to keep man from being at his worst and, thus, make life tolerable, for the greater number of people.
76) 4) dialog: My dear Monsieur Trillaud, I am not paid for finding it better. Laughter. Napoleon exchanges a significant look with his Major-domo who nods, picks up a wine decanter, and comes up to Madam Trillaud's place to refill her glass, deliberately spilli wine on the front of her dress.
76) 5) dialog: You clumsy fool. Quick, we need some water. Endless ad lib apologies by the Major-domo.
76) 7) dialog: No, no, I'll take care of it myself. We don't want to have any more accidents. Napoleon, the Major-domo and Madame Trillaud exit the roo amid apologies, reassurances. The guests resume their conversations, but Josephine, who seen the routine before, is distracted and agitated. 70.

77) 3) dialog: Ah, good, here -- allow me, Madame Trillaud. Napoleon and the Major-domo exchange another look, and th Major-domo hurriedly exits the room, springing a catchloc behind him. Napoleon's attention immediately shifts from Madame Trillaud's dress to Madame herself. His efforts to rub of the wine stains gradually become more intimate.
77) 5) dialog: Don't be afraid. Napoleon takes her in his arms.
77) 7) dialog: Don't be afraid, my dear. We shall be back before dessert is finished. Napoleon kisses her and fumbles with her clothes, to remo them. After several passionate seconds, there is a timid knock at the door. Madame Trillaud looks startled but Napoleon puts his fing to her lips and continues. After fifteen seconds, there is another knock on the door louder. 71.
77) 8) dialog: (whispers) Don't worry. It's only the night maid. More kissing, then a louder and more insistent knock. Thi time they both sit up. More knocking. Madame Trillaud is frightened.
77) 9) dialog: (angrily) Yes -- what is it?
77) 11) dialog: Go away -- I'm busy.
77) 13) dialog: Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
77) 15) dialog: How should I know. Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
77) 17) dialog: Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous! If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
77) 19) dialog: I will be there in five minutes. Go back to your guests.
77) 21) dialog: Yes!!
77) 23) dialog: Goodbye. Madame Trillaud starts to get up. Napoleon stops her.
77) 24) dialog: (whispering) Darling -- don't be ridiculous. We have five minutes. Where are you going?
77) 26) dialog: Of course we won't -- five minutes will never be noticed. He tumbles her back on to the bed.
78) 1) dialog: (in a subdued voice) How dare you do that to me tonight? How dare you? Do you realize who Madame Trillaud's husband is? Suppose he found out? Josephine sobs. Napoleon speaks in sharp hisses, to keep servants from overhearing.
78) 2) dialog: Oh, shut up, will you? Josephine sobs.
78) 3) dialog: Your tears have absolutely no effect on me... What a fool I have been! I am not a man like any other man. I must be free -- I must be free to do what I please. I must be free of this sordid jealousy! 73. Napoleon looks at the figure of his distraught wife. She on her knees, slumped across the seat of a chair.
78) 4) dialog: (slowly and quietly) Very well, then, I will not put a specific time limit on this, but you must accept the idea that we will have to be divorced, and soon... And, from now on, we will sleep in separate bedrooms. This last remark finally causes Josephine to attempt to speak, red-eyed, sniveling, unable to put words together without involuntary shudders and sobs.

A party of 50 Austrian hussars, escorting 3 Imperial carriages, comes to a halt. Drummers and trumpeters sound a salute. Napoleon helps the defeated Emperor Francis, of Austria, his carriage, embracing him with cordiality. This is the first meeting between Napoleon and an importa European monarch.
86) 1) dialog: Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
86) 3) dialog: I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
86) 5) dialog: Shall we move closer to the fire?
86) 7) dialog: Will Alexander be joining us soon?
86) 9) dialog: Oh...?
86) 11) dialog: I see. Francis has developed a violent chill.
86) 13) dialog: (interrupting) My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
86) 15) dialog: (offering a flask) Would you like some brandy?
86) 17) dialog: I'll have the fire built up. He shouts to his staff.
86) 18) dialog: Berthier, we need some more wood for the fire -- and some brandy. Berthier issues orders and soldiers dash off for the wood aide dashes forward with the brandy.
86) 20) dialog: Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear? Francis downs a big swig of brandy. 79.
86) 22) dialog: Ah, well, that is the first rule of warfare. You must wear long- sleeved and long-legged underwear. You can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom. They both laugh -- Francis, cheerlessly. FADE OUT.

It is an incredible sight, made of huge lo and planks, beautifully carpeted, draped with bunting, an with two small pavilions built on top, their roofs and wa covered with drapery, flags and colored silks. On the opposite banks are the massed formations and color the French and Russian Imperial Guards. 81. At a prearranged time, nervously checked and rechecked by pocket-watches, clicking open and closed, the two Emperor set off, in decorated long boats, to their rendezvous in stream. As they proceed, an unintentional race between oarsmen develops. Napoleon disembarks first and is thus able to welcome Tsa Alexander aboard. They embrace and, at this moment, a tumultuous roar of approval, the sound of fanfares, the beating of drums, is forth from both banks of the river. It is a splendid and marvelously absurd scene.
91) 3) dialog: And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
91) 5) dialog: Ah -- you approve?
91) 7) dialog: I'm glad you like it.

But, at the same time, there is something very peculiar about him -- something lacking, but it is impossible to foresee precisely what will be lacking in any given instance, for the defect seems infinitely variable.
97) 0) text: Alexander and Napoleon sit together, naked. 84.
97) 1) dialog: You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back. When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
97) 3) dialog: Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present. Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack. Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said. "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest." And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
97) 5) dialog: What do you mean?
97) 7) dialog: That is a problem, and I can appreciate your feelings. But I'm sure you have great talent for war, and I could teach you a lot. If we are ever at war again together, you should lead, say, 30,000 men, under my orders -- you would soon get the feel of it.

98) 6) dialog: Yes, he has. Talleyrand looks dismayed and leafs through some more pap
98) 8) dialog: That is correct.
98) 10) dialog: I very seriously doubt it. I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy. With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse. More than of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
98) 12) dialog: We have a treaty with Austria.
98) 14) dialog: My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France. It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties. The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
98) 16) dialog: What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force. 87.
