34) 43) text: M-Mumbling, "Truth. Truth is like, like  a blanket that always leaves your feet  cold."  The students begin to laugh and Todd opens his eyes. Keat quickly gestures for him to close them again. KEATING
34) 44) text: Forget them, forget them. Stay with the  blanket. Tell me about that blanket.  TODD
34) 45) text: Y-Y-Y-You push it, stretch it, it'll  never be enough. You kick at it, beat  it, it'll never cover any of us.
