11) 14) dialog: I wish I could tell you more but I am not allowed.

22) 5) dialog: And then there is the inner track, here. These symbols, as you can see, are unlike any ever found.

A Technician ope the top of the probe and places a caged RAT inside. As each symbol aligns on the StarGate, a LASER ignites in the center of the ring. Each additional laser builds the intensity of the light. Daniel is amazed. He adjusts his glasses to get a better look when they suddenly CRACK.
32) 10) dialog: I should have warned you about that.
32) 17) dialog: Blue dot. The flashing BLUE DOT is all the way on the OTHER SIDE of the screen, lower right corner.
