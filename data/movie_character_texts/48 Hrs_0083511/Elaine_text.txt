1) 15) text: Elaine stares at him as Cates turns off the water.
1) 16) dialog: What am I wanted for?
1) 19) dialog: I don't think your gun's loaded...
1) 21) dialog: I still don't think it's loaded.
1) 22) text: Elaine shakes her head and smiles, folds her arms over he breasts, shivers a little... Cates looks at the cylinder, spins it...
1) 24) dialog: You're hopeless.
1) 27) dialog: I'm all wet.
1) 31) dialog: A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
1) 33) dialog: Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
1) 35) dialog: Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
1) 37) dialog: Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
1) 39) dialog: If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
1) 41) dialog: Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
1) 44) dialog: You oversimplify every...
1) 48) dialog: Right...
3) 16) dialog: You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
3) 20) dialog: You know, that's my toothbrush, Jack.
3) 23) dialog: Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
3) 27) dialog: That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
3) 29) dialog: Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
3) 32) dialog: When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
3) 34) dialog: I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
3) 40) dialog: You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
3) 42) dialog: Call me later.
3) 44) dialog: Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
3) 47) dialog: I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
3) 50) dialog: Jack, wait.  Here...
3) 52) dialog: (continuing) It's cold as hell out these mornings, and you know what the man said, the coldest winter I ever spent was the summer I spent in San Francisco...
5) 246) dialog: Great place for lunch.
5) 248) dialog: You made the front page.
5) 251) dialog: Jack, are you okay?
5) 254) dialog: I thought you might come over to my place to recuperate.  I don't have to go to work until the day after tomorrow.
5) 258) dialog: Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
5) 260) dialog: Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
5) 262) dialog: Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
5) 264) dialog: I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
8) 62) dialog: Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
8) 65) dialog: Come on, Jack ... you're making me work too Goddamn hard at this...
8) 68) dialog: This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
9) 6) text: Hammond gets in the car as Cates readjusts Elaine's scarf the mirror.
17) 126) dialog: In the Chronicle Restaurant and Bar, a well appointed establishment off Montgomery Street.
17) 127) dialog: I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
17) 129) dialog: No wonder you're so popular.
17) 131) dialog: So am I.
17) 132) dialog: Jack, this afternoon...          Hey, look, when...
17) 133) dialog: You first.
17) 140) dialog: Jack, are you still there?
17) 146) dialog: Jack?  What was that?
17) 150) dialog: Jack, wait...
17) 230) dialog: Hello.
17) 232) dialog: Fuck you.
18) 5) dialog: Hey, I don't believe it.
18) 7) dialog: I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
18) 9) dialog: I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
18) 12) dialog: Who the hell are you?
18) 15) dialog: I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
18) 17) dialog: Shrink major, not a shrink.
18) 20) dialog: We're closed.
18) 22) text: Elaine turns to him; it's short and sweet.
18) 23) dialog: Drink your drink, pay up and get out.
18) 25) dialog: Hey, just fuck off.  My friends have guns.
18) 26) text: Cates holds up his pistol. The man's eyes widen and he tu his angry move toward her into a skedaddle out of the bar Elaine finishes drying a glass and approaches.
18) 27) dialog: (continuing) You real down?
18) 35) dialog: How would you know?
18) 37) dialog: That's no bull.
18) 44) dialog: Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
18) 46) dialog: Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
18) 49) dialog: In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
18) 52) dialog: What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
18) 54) dialog: It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
18) 56) dialog: When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
18) 58) dialog: Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
18) 62) text: He looks at Elaine.
18) 64) dialog: What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
18) 66) text: He kisses Elaine.
31) 29) dialog: How'd they take it back at headquarters?
31) 31) dialog: I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
31) 35) dialog: Where is he?
31) 37) dialog: Tell me.
31) 39) text: Elaine smiles, leans close.
31) 40) dialog: You're impossible...
