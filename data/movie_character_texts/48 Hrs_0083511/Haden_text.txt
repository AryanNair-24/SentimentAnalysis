5) 163) dialog: Cates, I'll need to see you in five minutes, exactly five.
5) 166) dialog: D'you read me, Cates...
5) 167) text: Haden continues moving away.
5) 219) text: Haden comes out of his office.
5) 220) dialog: Get in here, Cates.
5) 225) dialog: Damn you, Cates ... Get in here.
5) 226) text: Cates walks into Haden's cubicle.
5) 228) dialog: Yeah, I read the report...
5) 229) text: Haden shuffles some papers, seems to ignore Cates.
5) 231) dialog: Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
5) 232) text: Cates almost smiles at Haden.
5) 234) dialog: Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
5) 236) dialog: You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
5) 238) dialog: Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
5) 240) dialog: Jack?
5) 242) dialog: Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.

17) 43) text: Haden watches the Morgue Personnel wheel out the body of Patrolman.
17) 44) dialog: Which one pulled the trigger?
17) 46) dialog: You couldn't get to him?
17) 48) dialog: (continuing) What a screw-up.
17) 50) text: Haden starts toward the street. Looks back at Cates.
17) 51) dialog: Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
17) 53) dialog: Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
17) 54) text: Cates looks at Haden for a moment... Turns and walks away. TRANSITION.
17) 280) dialog: A bus, you goddamn whiskey mick cop, you lost a stolen bus... We got five deaths related to Ganz, all of 'em law enforcement related, and you blow it for a lousy nigger convict...
17) 282) dialog: (continuing) That's rights I called him a nigger.  You bet I did ... I saw the report on that little piece of shit.  If he spent one legal day in his whole life, it'd be a record...This is it for you... suspension, review board... you've had it.  When it gets 'round you protect a con rather than nail a cop killer...
17) 285) dialog: Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.

17) 291) dialog: Go fuck yourself convict.
