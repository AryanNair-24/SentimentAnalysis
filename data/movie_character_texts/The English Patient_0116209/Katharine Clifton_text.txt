She goes to the chair and removes her clothes one by one until she’s standing naked in full view of Gyges, and indeed she was more lovely than he could have imagined.

And hearing his story, this is what she said -
1) 88) dialog: - she said, “Either you must submit to death for gazing on that which you should not, or else kill my husband who shamed me and become King in his place.” Clifton makes a face of outrage. For Katharine the story suddenly collapsed. She feels Almasy’s eyes on her. 18

4) 22) dialog: No really, I’d like you to have them.

4) 70) dialog: Thank God. Oh thank God. There's excited shouting from the boys. Then a distant re Almasy laughs with relief.
4) 72) dialog: Am I K in your book? I think I must be. Almasy turns to her. He runs the blade of his arm across neck.
4) 99) dialog: Will you not come in?
