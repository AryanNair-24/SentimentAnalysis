Teasing me with its nearness and immensity. And all I get is a thin stream of it. A finger's width of the rope that ties me to life. Having now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, th wanders over to the iron lung.
0) 17) dialog: Shit! His face continues to contort as he tries to cope with th terrible itching.  He shakes his head violently, then sto suddenly and closes his eyes. We hear his thoughts.
0) 18) dialog: Okay, just focus. Now, scratch with your mind, okay, your mind, scratch with your mind... After a couple more nose twitches, he settles down. It se to have worked. In his peripheral vision, Mark can see th cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair, one of t only other pieces of furniture in the room. The first hin of dawn start to appear through the curtains. They illuminate a large framed portrait of the Virgin Mary han on the wall.   Mark acknowledges it.
0) 19) dialog: Good morning. Sunlight streams in, making the picture look truly sacred
0) 23) dialog: You're late.
0) 26) dialog: Joan I swear this was one crazy bitch Who'd swing me about enough to scare me, But careful enough so she could say: "Now what was all the yelling about? You polios are screamers. Always were." I didn't say a word, but typed my skinny novel in my head, And thought about revenge. In the course of washing his private parts, Mark has an involuntary erection. Joan gives him a shriveling look. H feels belittled and humiliated.
0) 30) dialog: You need help moving furniture? She has no apparent sense of humor.
0) 32) dialog: What if you don't last another two weeks?
0) 34) dialog: Joan never failed to put me in a crappy mood. It was also a drag that I was no longer allowed to use my other gurney, the self-propelled one. It had caused a couple of spectacular accidents. They turn a corner and approach a church.
0) 36) dialog: Basically, in spite of all the mirrors, I couldn't see where I was going.
0) 45) dialog: I'm definitely a true believer. But I believe in a God with a sense of humor. A wicked sense of humor. One who created me in His own image. Father Brendan enters. There is an awkward short moment w he realizes that there is no point in offering to shake hands. For no good reason, he nods instead.
0) 48) dialog: No, we haven't. I'm Mark O'Brien. I knew Father Seamus very well. I'm sorry that he's not here any more.
0) 50) dialog: Yes, I would. By the way, I enjoyed Mass. I liked your tone. Father Brendan is not sure how to take this.
0) 52) dialog: You don't believe absolute privacy is an essential part of the confessional, do you?
0) 54) dialog: I told my attendant to come back in half an hour. Is that okay?
0) 56) dialog: Did Father Seamus say anything to you about me?
0) 58) dialog: I can be a bit time consuming, but I'm worth the trouble. Father Brendan breaks a smile for the first time.
0) 61) dialog: Look, this is not exactly a confession. I haven't yet done the deed. I was hoping to sort of get a quote in advance. Father Brendan sits down.
0) 63) dialog: The most immediate thing on my mind would be my attendant, Joan. I'm thinking of getting rid of her. It's an evil thought, but I can't help it.
0) 65) dialog: No, neither of those. She looks at me the wrong way. It's that you- need-me-more-than-I-need-you look. I'd like to show her she's wrong, just for the evil satisfaction it will give me. Is that a sin, Father?
0) 67) dialog: Yes, it troubles me a lot. Because maybe it's really a power trip. Me against her. Me against the world.
0) 69) dialog: I can't stand her.
0) 71) dialog: Then I have your blessing to fire her?
0) 74) dialog: That's good enough for me.
0) 76) dialog: Same here.
0) 81) dialog: Amanda would have been a pretty girl to touch, to hold, to kiss, to take to bed.
0) 85) dialog: Her perfect, pale skin, Her Tudor court face Her strong, fleshy legs Drove me into ecstasies of despair. Mark asks a question.
0) 86) dialog: Do you have any experience?
0) 88) dialog: That sounds perfect. Mark stares at her lovingly.
0) 91) dialog: Three or four hours. Depends whether I'm having fun. 12A   INT. MARK'S PLACE.
0) 93) dialog: She'd count in French before lifting me, un, deux, trois, quatre! I'd scream Tugged by her athletic arms From the everlasting gravity.
0) 96) text: She took me on a picnic once, With her boyfriend and another couple. Lust crackled in the air between those twentyish people. Amanda is clearly paying more attention to Mark than to M MARK (V.O.)
0) 99) dialog: As she glided through crowds of lives She couldn't leave me lying there Dried out bubble gum stuck on the underneath of existence.
0) 106) dialog: What does your boyfriend think of me?
0) 108) dialog: I'm interested in the opinion of an asshole.
0) 110) dialog: He's right.
0) 113) dialog: So with her gentle fearless heart She took me in. I thrived in her garden And wanted more.
0) 117) dialog: I love you. She says nothing and gives the faintest of smiles, then p the shirt back. They continue round the store in thoughtf silence and avoid eye contact with each other. We sense f the looks on their faces that this moment spells the end beautiful friendship.
0) 121) dialog: She didn't seem to. 11A.
0) 124) dialog: Well, in case she didn't get it the first time, I told her again that I was in love with her, and wanted to marry her, thinking it might swing things.
0) 126) dialog: Yes. She left. They sit in silence for a while. Father Brendan seems to at something of a loss.
0) 128) dialog: Not as yet. Father, I think I need a hug. After a moment of surprise, Father Brendan rises to the occasion. He seems to know how to move Mark gently and efficiently. They hug.
0) 135) dialog: Have you had any experience?
0) 137) dialog: Would you get that, please. Vera picks up the phone and answers a little hesitantly.
0) 140) dialog: Could you press that button and put it on the speakerphone. She does as she is asked with perfect efficiency.
0) 141) dialog: Hi, Sandy.
0) 143) dialog: I'm good. I have a new attendant. She answered the phone. Her name's Vera.
0) 148) dialog: Why now?
0) 150) dialog: No, now is fine.
0) 152) dialog: There was no denying it. A door had opened which I could not close, and in invisible writing it said: "Do not enter".
0) 161) dialog: Uh, I think I've actually got enough to work on. Thanks.
0) 165) dialog: Okay, shall we start?
0) 172) dialog: Who are these people? I feel like an anthropologist interviewing a tribe of headhunters. The cat seems to understand.
0) 175) dialog: Uh, may I please speak to someone in the Center on Sexuality and Disability, please. A pause.
0) 179) dialog: Thank God.
0) 181) dialog: I'm sorry to have bothered you.
0) 183) text: Mark hesitates. He winces under the strain of having to m a decision.
0) 189) dialog: It won't fit. It's not going to fit. Let's go back.
0) 198) dialog: No! One more heave and the gurney goes in with a jolt.
0) 199) dialog: Aah!
0) 203) dialog: No. That would have been unthinkable.
0) 205) dialog: That's the way they saw the world. It wasn't just that polite people didn't think about sex. No-one did. It was never discussed. As far as they were concerned, there was nothing down there. Laura listens. She is pretty in a dark, angular way. A ph on her desk rings.
0) 207) dialog: What's that from?
0) 211) text: People notice. It's not easy, the whole thing, attracting a guy, dating, sex, all very problematic. MARK
0) 213) text: Well, you better believe it. MARK
0) 215) text: Of achieving your romantic fantasy? Very small to minute. MARK
0) 217) text: Mark, I'm just a humble sex therapist. I try to help people with sex problems that can be addressed. Your problem, I understand, is that you have never had sex. MARK
0) 219) text: Would I be correct in assuming you're unable to masturbate? MARK
0) 221) text: Has anyone done it for you? MARK
0) 225) dialog: Not specifically. I asked someone to marry me. She declined. Does that come close to masturbation?
0) 227) dialog: Oh?
0) 229) dialog: Would this be covered by my medical benefits?
0) 231) dialog: So, basically, I would be paying for sex.
1) 0) text: Mark comes back to reality.
1) 1) dialog: What sort of cost would I be looking at?
1) 3) dialog: Say, one, just to try it and see if I like it.
1) 5) dialog: I've set aside $500. Do you think that would cover things?
1) 11) dialog: Things are sort of confusing at the moment. I would appreciate your advice, as a friend, if you know what I mean. Father Brendan sits down on the end of a pew next to Mark
1) 13) dialog: Do you remember at one point you suggested I might see a therapist?
1) 15) dialog: Well, one way or another, it's a long story, I ended up seeing a therapist, a particular sort of therapist, a sex therapist.
1) 17) dialog: My penis speaks to me, Father Brendan. Sometimes I ejaculate during a bed bath in front of my attendant.
1) 21) text: Don't worry about it. Go on. Mark pauses to take a few breaths on his oxygen mouthpiec then goes on. MARK
1) 23) text: Hold on. What do you mean "have sex"? MARK
1) 25) text: Sorry, that wasn't what... I mean, are we talking about sexual intercourse? MARK
1) 27) text: Outside marriage? MARK
1) 29) text: What is the difference between this sexual specialist and a common prostitute? MARK
1) 32) dialog: I trust what my therapist said about her.
1) 34) dialog: Thirty-eight.
1) 36) dialog: I never had any spare cash before. That's a major factor, and I'm probably getting close to my use-by date.
1) 38) dialog: Your advice as a friend.
1) 40) dialog: Let's say I value your advice just as much as I do the therapist's.
1) 42) dialog: I think sex is a serious matter. It's one of the most persistent themes in the bible. (MORE)
1) 44) dialog: So, is it possible for me to know a woman, in the biblical sense, and do I want to find out?
1) 46) dialog: Please. Father Brendan contemplates for a few moments. He looks u the statue of Jesus, then makes a decision.
1) 48) dialog: What?
1) 50) dialog: Really?
1) 52) dialog: To tell the truth, I'm scared.
1) 62) dialog: I really feel proud of myself, imposing on someone I hardly know, to fornicate in their home.
1) 67) dialog: Wow! Carmen points to the bedside table.
1) 69) dialog: No, I'll bring my own sheets, towels and anything else we need.
1) 72) dialog: Great karma for the house. My God, the pressure, already. I can't stand it.
1) 93) dialog: Would you get it please?
1) 100) dialog: Hullo, this is Mark.
1) 102) dialog: Uh, yes.
1) 104) dialog: Uh, yes, I think that would be fine for me.
1) 106) dialog: Boston. You?
1) 108) dialog: Wouldn't want to paint it.
1) 114) dialog: Holy Mother of God, what are "body awareness exercises"?
1) 118) dialog: Doesn't matter.
1) 120) dialog: I'm not acting.
1) 123) dialog: Who are "they"? Vera rings the front doorbell. They wait.
1) 124) dialog: She's forgotten. Vera says nothing. She rings the bell again.
1) 125) dialog: My God, she's forgotten, or she's gotten the date wrong. Okay, we might as well turn round and go back. Come on, let's go.
1) 133) dialog: (weakly)
1) 136) dialog: What's the time?
1) 138) dialog: I think there's a strong possibility she's had second thoughts.
1) 140) dialog: And if she does arrive, she would be perfectly within her rights to turn around and run.
1) 143) text: No, that's fine. Come in. I'm Vera, I'm one of Mark's helpers. Cheryl sees Mark. There is no noticeable reaction in her face, just a smile. CHERYL
1) 144) text: Hi, Mark O'Brien. Mark clears his throat with a little difficulty. MARK
1) 147) text: Yes, two hours, that would be perfect. She closes the door behind her. Mark feels totally abando
1) 149) text: Your money's on the dresser. Cheryl walks over to the dresser. When her back is turned Mark screws up his face in self-disgust. She finds an envelope.
1) 153) text: Yes, it was. Shall we start again? MARK
1) 156) dialog: I'm sorry. CHERYL
1) 157) text: The other thing is, there is a limit to the number of sessions we can have together. Did Laura mention that when you saw her? MARK
1) 159) text: The limit is six. But that gives us plenty of opportunity to explore. Now, I understand you are able to have an erection. MARK
1) 162) text: Is this your place? MARK
1) 167) text: Mark, just take a deep breath, then let go. MARK
1) 170) text: Laura told me you were a poet. What's it like to be a poet? MARK
1) 173) dialog: Thank you. CHERYL
1) 175) dialog: Sure. CHERYL
1) 177) dialog: It keeps me breathing. I can spend a few hours outside of it, with my portable respirator, depending on how I feel. But I work and sleep in the iron lung. 34A.
1) 181) text: I meant your breathing. MARK
1) 183) text: That's great. Do you have any areas of unusual sensitivity? Any parts of your body you don't want me to touch? MARK
1) 185) text: Shall we get undressed then? Mark is taken by surprise by the suddenness of it. He hesitates momentarily. MARK
1) 186) text: Sure. Cheryl starts to unbutton his shirt. Mark's terror is vis in his eyes and she can also feel his heart palpitating. starts to slowly extract one of Mark's arms from his shir sleeve. Suddenly, he lets out a piercing scream. MARK (CONT'D)
1) 188) text: What's wrong? MARK
1) 190) text: Tell me what's wrong. MARK
1) 193) text: Okay, okay, I've got it. Don't worry. She carefully frees his fingers and eases the sleeve off. MARK
1) 195) text: Mark, I'm going to be really careful with you. I don't want to hurt or injure you in any way, but it's really not sexy when you yell at me. Okay? MARK
1) 197) text: But you'll tell me calmly the moment anything starts to hurt? MARK
1) 200) text: Nice shirt. MARK
1) 203) text: Okay, I'm going to slide these down. Hold your breath. She pulls. He screams, in fear more than pain. MARK
1) 212) dialog: No. Cheryl continues undressing, Mark looks away.
1) 214) dialog: Whenever I'm naked, everyone else in the room is usually dressed. Now that I'm in bed with another naked person, I'm very confused. She strokes his hair.
1) 216) dialog: I'd always expected that God, or my parents, would intervene to keep this moment from happening. She slides her hand down. She can feel his heart thumping
1) 218) text: Mark, close your eyes and focus on your sense of touch. He closes his eyes. CHERYL (CONT'D)
1) 220) text: You have soft hair. It's nice to the touch. So you like it? MARK
1) 221) text: I do. She moves her fingers round behind his ear, then the fron his ear. MARK (CONT'D)
1) 223) text: Weird good? Or weird bad? MARK
1) 224) text: Just weird. She moves her hand down his neck. MARK (CONT'D)
1) 226) text: Still good? MARK
1) 227) text: Everything good so far, except the ear. She moves her fingers along his side, very, very lightly. Mark, so far, this is the best. 37B.
1) 231) dialog: People tell me I'm very perceptive.
1) 234) dialog: Yes.
1) 236) dialog: Oh, oh.
1) 240) dialog: That's good for me.
1) 244) dialog: I was terrified.
1) 246) dialog: Can I ask you something?
1) 248) dialog: Anything, really. Tell me something about yourself. Anything.
1) 250) dialog: Welcome back.
1) 255) dialog: Cleansed and victorious.
1) 257) dialog: Tell me about your first sexual experience.
1) 259) dialog: Was he Chinese?
1) 261) dialog: Why is that?
1) 263) dialog: Are they happy now you've got a Chinese boyfriend?
1) 265) dialog: What's his dick like?
1) 267) dialog: Why do you call it a dick instead of a penis?
1) 270) dialog: The thing is, it was all over so damn quickly.
1) 282) dialog: I don't know what I had envisaged it would be like, the first time I mean. But that wasn't the image I had. I thought there would be more to it. Not that it was unpleasant. After all, I was in bed with a naked woman. She complimented me on my shirt and my hair. She held my penis. I haven't even seen my penis for over thirty years. Anyway, onward. Am I sharing too much?
1) 285) dialog: "Sometimes the head of the penis may be too large to penetrate the vaginal opening smoothly, in which case the application of lubricant is recommended to avoid possible..." Oh, my God!
1) 289) dialog: We're attempting intercourse.
1) 291) dialog: What do you think of it? Intercourse.
1) 297) dialog: I do. As she moves towards the bed, almost naked, the last thin she takes off is her bra.
1) 302) text: Oh God! Oh God! Mark's expression of bliss turns to one of anger and frustration.
1) 304) dialog: Damn! Shit!
1) 306) dialog: I did it again. This time, I ejaculated on her thigh. Father Brendan winces.
1) 307) dialog: I felt cursed, that the whole enterprise was cursed. It seemed like a totally just punishment. God wasn't actually denying my sexuality. He was merely pointing out to me how useless it was.
1) 313) dialog: What do you mean, where were we?
1) 315) dialog: Is there anything I need to do?
1) 318) dialog: It won't fit. It's not going to fit.
1) 320) dialog: No, it's dangerous. It's too big.
1) 322) dialog: It won't fit. It'll hurt. It's too risky.
1) 324) dialog: Shit!
1) 327) dialog: I'm really sorry.
1) 340) dialog: I'm sorry to lay all this on you, Father. My worry now is that it's never going to happen. I'm never going to have intercourse with Cheryl, or any other woman. Maybe intercourse would prove I was an adult. Maybe I don't want to cross that line. Maybe this was a bad idea.
1) 342) dialog: Please.
1) 348) dialog: Only a little.
1) 351) dialog: Yes, of course I would. Vera gets a bottle of cologne and gives Mark a couple of bursts behind the ears.
1) 352) dialog: I have a good feeling about today, a very good feeling.
1) 354) dialog: I had a terrible feeling it was never going to happen, but I think today's the day.
1) 356) dialog: Please.
1) 360) dialog: You couldn't have wished for nicer weather.
1) 362) dialog: Beautiful weather. She steps up to ring the bell, then hesitates. There is something of a hubbub coming from inside. Both she and Ma can hear it clearly.
1) 380) dialog: Thanks.
1) 382) dialog: I'm sure it'll come in handy.
1) 385) dialog: Very atmospheric.
1) 387) dialog: Do you think I could be one of those people? She sits on the bed and starts to undo his shirt.
1) 389) dialog: As in racy and sophisticated?
1) 402) dialog: I'm   choking Cheryl moves away. We realize she has been perched astrid his face, more or less. The coughing continues. Mark look bit panicked.
1) 403) dialog: The mouth-piece.
1) 405) text: I guess that one's off the menu until further notice. Mark finally lets go of the mouth-piece. He looks melanch She does not fail to notice. CHERYL (CONT'D)
1) 406) text: Come on, lighten up, will you. Mark smiles. He seems to be lost in some memory. MARK
1) 407) text: Pony girl, Pony girl, Won't you be my pony girl? He looks at Cheryl. MARK (CONT'D)
1) 408) text: That was what my father used to sing to my little sister, Karin. That was before she died. She was kind of a sad little girl. It didn't do much good. I'm really sorry that the last time I saw her, I fought with her. I made her cry. Mark's eyes begin to look teary. MARK (CONT'D)
1) 410) text: Mark, I'm just going to go the bathroom for a quick pee. When I come back, we're going to achieve full penetration. But before I go, I want you to close your eyes. MARK
1) 415) dialog: Yes, very easily.
1) 419) dialog: I feel very exhilarated, running next to the Atlantic Ocean, feeling the wind and the wet sand between my toes.
1) 421) dialog: Yes, I really feel like him.
1) 423) dialog: I don't understand what you mean. I said I can feel like him. Of course I can picture him.
1) 425) dialog: Yes.
1) 430) dialog: She either forgot to close the bathroom door, or didn't bother to close it. Mark pauses as he hears some distant footsteps. Father Brendan looks over his shoulder. They finally pass. Mark continues.
1) 431) dialog: I found the sound of her peeing incredibly erotic, and the sound of her tearing off toilet paper incredibly intimate. By the time she came back I had a terrific boner.
1) 434) dialog: Aahh!
1) 453) text: To answer your earlier question, I grew up in Salem, brought up Catholic, like you, but the church didn't appreciate my attitude towards sex. MARK
1) 455) text: Yes, I liked it. They like to think they threw me out, but I threw them out. So for years I didn't believe in anything, and now I'm converting to Judaism. MARK
1) 457) text: I didn't think of that. MARK
1) 459) text: My husband asked me to do it before his grandmother dies. The idea is, if it makes her happy and him happy, then it will do the same for me. Our son is neutral on the subject, but theoretically, if it looks like it makes me happy, it'll make him happy too. That's the way my husband's family talks, and thinks. The fact that I'm happy already, doesn't seem to be relevant. MARK
1) 461) text: Tony. He's 14 years-old and very smart. You'd like him. Cheryl and Mark lie together in contented silence for a while. MARK
1) 464) dialog: How much do you want him to know?
1) 468) text: He's a philosopher. MARK
1) 472) text: Hey, we did really good stuff today. You were fantastic. You're a fully fledged male homo sapiens endowed with a handsome and substantial penis which now has a proven track record. You should be pleased. MARK
1) 474) text: You were really and truly inside me. MARK
1) 476) text: Five or six seconds. MARK
1) 478) text: That's a long time for some people. You were pretty excited. I don't know what you were thinking about. MARK
1) 482) dialog: Did you come?
1) 484) dialog: Can we try for that next time? She hesitates for a moment.
1) 486) dialog: Yes, that's what I want.
1) 504) dialog: Still exhausted.
1) 506) dialog: It was okay. I liked some of the other things just as much, or better, but I'm glad it's behind me.
1) 509) dialog: When this is all over, I'm going to write an article about it. After all, sex sells. Seriously.
1) 511) dialog: Absolutely.
1) 513) dialog: She's the most wonderful person on the planet. I'm glad we finally had intercourse, because now I realize that everything I do with her feels just great.
1) 527) dialog: So, what do you think?
1) 532) dialog: Can we meet somewhere for a coffee? Somewhere nice. My treat.
1) 538) dialog: How could you possibly describe anything to do with me as normal?
1) 541) dialog: We don't have to talk about business.
1) 544) dialog: Could you put my cup right on the edge of the table there, and stick the straw in my mouth, please?
1) 547) dialog: Perfect.
1) 549) dialog: Thanks.
1) 552) dialog: We don't have to do much talking. Cheryl smiles at him. She is looking gorgeous today.
1) 554) dialog: I just want to be seen with you in public. I find that as sexy as anything we've done so far. He sips on his coffee and soaks her in with his eyes. 62A.
1) 556) dialog: I want people to say "Who's the guy with the blonde? How did he get so lucky?"
1) 558) dialog: Okay, if some old girlfriend from school you hadn't seen for years turned up suddenly, like right now, how would you introduce me? As your boyfriend?
1) 560) dialog: Really?
1) 562) dialog: Yes.
1) 564) dialog: Who?
1) 566) dialog: You really can picture me as husband material?
1) 568) dialog: Would you write down your address for me, please? 62B.
1) 607) dialog: Do you think she'll like the shirt?
1) 609) dialog: Amanda?
1) 611) dialog: It's been a while.
1) 613) dialog: Why are you going to Germany?
1) 616) dialog: For how long?
1) 618) dialog: But why go to Germany? It's the only place in the world where humor is actually forbidden. She laughs, then smiles quietly, then touches him.
1) 620) dialog: Really?
1) 622) dialog: Yes, I love you, but not in that way. I love you, but I'm not in love with you. Blah, blah, blah. You know how it goes. Mark lets out a deep, meaningful sigh. For a time, he and Father Brendan maintain a respectful silence.
