1) 81) dialog: What is it?
1) 84) dialog: I'm not your girlfriend. When someone calls, particularly someone you don't know, you can use the word 'Mom'.
1) 86) dialog: Hullo, this is Cheryl.
1) 88) dialog: I haven't heard from you in a while. How are you?
1) 90) dialog: Hold on a moment, please. She covers the mouthpiece of the phone.
1) 91) dialog: Hey, cut that out! He takes no notice. She puts the phone down and moves tow him. He closes the fridge door and runs.
1) 96) dialog: Hi, this is Cheryl Cohen-Greene. May I speak to Mark?
1) 101) dialog: Hi, Mark. I'm Cheryl. Laura called to introduce you. I understand you'd like to meet. Is that right? Mark can hardly speak. He eventually forces the sound fro his throat.
1) 103) dialog: I could see you on the seventeenth, at eleven o'clock. Would that be any good for you?
1) 105) dialog: Hey, where you from?
1) 107) dialog: Salem. Small world.
1) 111) dialog: We'll be talking for a while to begin with. Then, if you agree, we can also start doing some body awareness exercises in your first session.
1) 142) text: Hi, I'm Cheryl. I'm sorry I'm late. VERA
1) 143) text: No, that's fine. Come in. I'm Vera, I'm one of Mark's helpers. Cheryl sees Mark. There is no noticeable reaction in her face, just a smile. CHERYL
1) 145) text: Hi, Cheryl Cohen Greene. Vera is already at the front door. VERA
1) 146) text: I'll be back, say, in two hours? CHERYL
1) 148) dialog: So... Mark blurts out. MARK
1) 149) text: Your money's on the dresser. Cheryl walks over to the dresser. When her back is turned Mark screws up his face in self-disgust. She finds an envelope.
1) 150) dialog: Thank you. She puts it in her bag. Mark eyes her carefully. MARK
1) 154) text: Please, you start. She sits down on the bed and looks at him. It is a very frank stare. She is trying to take a lot in. CHERYL
1) 158) text: I'm sorry, I don't remember. CHERYL
1) 160) text: Yes, but not out of choice. CHERYL
1) 161) text: Do you know how many men there are on this planet who would give anything for a natural erection? She looks around the room. CHERYL (CONT'D)
1) 163) text: No, it's a friend's. The only bedroom furniture I have at my place is an iron lung. I've sometimes thought about buying a futon, in case the need arose. CHERYL
1) 166) text: I've got the space. It can be expensive though, a nice futon. I mean, how much do you think a good one would cost? CHERYL
1) 168) text: Do I seem anxious? CHERYL
1) 169) text: You do a little. Cheryl lies down beside him. CHERYL (CONT'D)
1) 171) text: It's a way of living inside your own head, which is where I spend most of my time. CHERYL
1) 178) dialog: How do you feel right now?
1) 180) text: Out of my league. CHERYL
1) 182) text: Oh...fine. In fact, better than usual. CHERYL
1) 184) text: I have normal sensitivity all over. It's just that my muscles don't work. You can touch me anywhere. CHERYL
1) 186) text: Sure. Cheryl starts to unbutton his shirt. Mark's terror is vis in his eyes and she can also feel his heart palpitating. starts to slowly extract one of Mark's arms from his shir sleeve. Suddenly, he lets out a piercing scream. MARK (CONT'D)
1) 187) text: Ow! Ow! Stop! It hurts! She recoils, shocked. CHERYL
1) 189) text: Holy Mother of God! CHERYL
1) 194) text: Be careful, please. CHERYL
1) 196) text: I won't yell at you any more. CHERYL
1) 198) text: Yes. CHERYL
1) 199) text: Now, let's do the other arm. Little by little, she extracts the other arm. He grimaces way through it, but more in fear than in pain. She finall sets his shirt down on the end of the bed. CHERYL (CONT'D)
1) 201) text: You already said that. CHERYL
1) 202) text: Did I? I guess I'm a little anxious, too. She undoes the top of his pants. CHERYL (CONT'D)
1) 211) dialog: Ready?
1) 213) dialog: Okay, the difference between me and a prostitute is that I don't want your return business. I'm here to help you communicate about your sexual feelings, so you can share them with a future partner. She stands there for a few moments, but he keeps his eyes averted. She turns back the sheets, gets into bed beside and he finally looks at her.
1) 215) dialog: So, why is it confusing?
1) 218) text: Mark, close your eyes and focus on your sense of touch. He closes his eyes. CHERYL (CONT'D)
1) 219) text: I'd like you to tell me how it feels each time I touch a different part of your body. If something feels good, tell me. If something feels ticklish or bothers you, let me know. I don't want you to tolerate anything. I'm going to start with the top of your head... She strokes his hair. CHERYL (CONT'D)
1) 222) text: That feels weird. CHERYL
1) 225) text: Good. His shoulder. CHERYL
1) 230) dialog: You're clever to have worked that out. Her hands massage their way down his torso. Mark's reacti are a little like shock waves.
1) 232) dialog: Would you like to see what I feel like? She carefully takes his hand and caresses the fingers aro one of her breasts, then puts his hand back. Cheryl's hands move further down his body.
1) 233) dialog: Are you wearing cologne?
1) 235) dialog: Mmm, my favorite brand. Okay, I'm going to move my hand along your stomach... and down to your pen... The expression on Mark's face changes to one of shock, th agony, then ecstasy.
1) 239) dialog: Next week, Friday the twentieth, same time?
1) 242) dialog: Next time we'll start to work on intercourse. She gathers her things together and gets up.
1) 243) dialog: Were you afraid at the thought of seeing me?
1) 245) dialog: You can be proud of yourself. You did great. We've made real progress.
1) 247) dialog: Of course. What would you like to ask?
1) 249) dialog: Sure. I'm a very private person. I have a private life, I do need you to be aware of that, but that's about it. This therapy is about you. There is a discreet knock at the front door and then a ke turns in the lock. A few moments later, Carmen and Vera c in.
1) 251) dialog: Perfect timing.
1) 274) dialog: First session. Mark is the oldest of four children and raised Catholic. He was extremely nervous. He yelled a lot when I took off his shirt, but I think more out of fear than pain. He cannot masturbate. Has only had the occasional kissing experience. He is capable of achieving an erection easily, but the unusual curvature of his body could be a serious obstacle to intercourse. She puts the recorder away in a file drawer and locks the drawer with a key, which she keeps with her.
1) 276) dialog: This gentleman I just started working with. He spends most of his life trapped in a big metal box. Her husband Josh turns over and mumbles something complet incomprehensible. She nudges him.
1) 277) dialog: Did you hear what I said?
1) 280) dialog: Don't forget to put the trash out in the morning. She turns around and goes to sleep.
1) 295) dialog: I want you to look at me this time. Go on, lift your eyes, look at me. He lifts his eyes. She pauses.
1) 296) dialog: Do you like watching me undress?
1) 298) dialog: From now on... She pulls back the bed covers and gets into bed with Mark
1) 299) dialog: You're going to start to understand the signals from your body... Their bodies touch. He looks blissful.
1) 300) dialog: ...and learn how to control... Then suddenly...
1) 312) dialog: Okay, I don't want to hear any more about God cursing you. I want the credit. It was my overpowering beauty that did it. It took you by surprise. Now, where were we?
1) 314) dialog: I'm going to touch you... I'm touching you... and when we both feel you're aroused, then I'm going to guide you into my vagina.
1) 317) dialog: Close your eyes, feel your body, that's all you need to do. Mark closes his eyes. In his mind's eye, he sees the sain figures in the beautiful stained glass windows of the chu with the afternoon sun blazing through. An equally saintl but naked Amanda floats towards him, her arms beckoning. When he opens his eyes, Cheryl is straddling him, but in Leaning Tower of Pisa sort of way. It is a struggle for h but somehow she is managing to get Mark into a workable position for intercourse. Suddenly, he panics.
1) 319) dialog: No, Mark, it will fit just fine.
1) 321) dialog: It's not too big. Relax.
1) 323) dialog: Please, stop this. I promise you, nothing bad will happen. Now, let's try again while you're still hard. She attempts to guide him in again. Mark grimaces, makes strange noise. We realize that he has just ejaculated aga involuntarily.
1) 329) dialog: Stop being sorry. And stop reading those stupid sex manuals. She snuggles up beside Mark.
1) 330) dialog: We still have some time. We can talk, which you seem to like, or you can suck on my nipples, which you also seem to like. Or, which one would you like to do first? Gradually, Mark is reassured.
1) 333) dialog: Mark seemed to be at his most relaxed when I sucked his penis. At the moment he is fixated on penis- vagina and his anxiety is focused around that. The root of his anxiety is his parents and his religion. He believes he doesn't deserve sex. He believes he is responsible for his little sister's death at the age of seven, because his mother was too busy looking after him.
1) 335) dialog: We discussed his fantasies. They are mostly masochistic.
1) 338) dialog: Again,   the idea of being punished. He has   never seen female genitalia before   and seems quite frightened by the   idea.
1) 368) dialog: Look, it may not be exactly what we had in mind, but I noticed there's quite a nice motel just a couple of blocks from here. Maybe it's worth checking out.
1) 386) dialog: Some people find motels exciting.
1) 388) dialog: Another nice shirt.
1) 391) dialog: You took the words right out of my mouth.
1) 405) text: I guess that one's off the menu until further notice. Mark finally lets go of the mouth-piece. He looks melanch She does not fail to notice. CHERYL (CONT'D)
1) 407) text: Pony girl, Pony girl, Won't you be my pony girl? He looks at Cheryl. MARK (CONT'D)
1) 409) text: My parents could have left me in the nursing home, you know. They found out the average life expectancy for polios in nursing homes was 18 months. So they took me home. They gave me a life. Cheryl props herself up on one elbow. CHERYL
1) 411) text: Is this a game? CHERYL
1) 414) dialog: Picture yourself as a six year old boy at the beach. Can you do that?
1) 418) dialog: Describe some of your feelings.
1) 420) dialog: Do you really feel like him?
1) 422) dialog: But can you really picture him?
1) 424) dialog: From the outside, I mean, as an adult, as you are now, looking at him with his crew cut and his little face?
1) 426) dialog: And are you mad at him? Do you blame him for getting polio? Was it his fault?
1) 433) dialog: I'm going to rub the tip of your cock around my vulva. When it's ready, I'll guide you in. Breathe slowly and think of something delicious. Mark thinks. Through his mind's eye, we see a succession images. Fingertips stroking a cat's fur. In the backgroun the sound of tom-toms. A tribal initiation rite. Drums, dancing, trances. Then Ravel's "Bolero". Clint Eastwood saying "make my day". Suddenly, and with a big yell, Mark comes.
1) 450) dialog: You awake?
1) 452) text: Uh-huh. CHERYL
1) 454) text: You had an attitude towards sex? CHERYL
1) 456) text: I guess it's good to have some kind of insurance. CHERYL
1) 458) text: Then why are you doing it? CHERYL
1) 460) text: What's your son's name? CHERYL
1) 461) text: Tony. He's 14 years-old and very smart. You'd like him. Cheryl and Mark lie together in contented silence for a while. MARK
1) 463) dialog: He knows I'm a sex therapist. There's a certificate on the wall. But he hasn't had sex yet. So... How much can he really know? He's not a boy, he's not a man.
1) 465) dialog: Well, I want him to have some idea in his head. I hope it's a nice one.
1) 467) text: What does your husband do? CHERYL
1) 469) text: Wow! You mean, like, at a university? CHERYL
1) 470) text: No, in his own mind. He runs the house, plays guitar, thinks a lot. She notices the time. CHERYL (CONT'D)
1) 471) text: It's kind of late. She gets up and starts to get dressed. CHERYL (CONT'D)
1) 473) text: Was I really inside you? CHERYL
1) 475) text: For how long? CHERYL
1) 477) text: Is that all? CHERYL
1) 481) dialog: Well, you definitely achieved penetration. It was penis-vagina all the way. And you definitely get an A for orgasm. She is ready to go. She comes over to Mark and kisses him the cheek.
1) 483) dialog: No, Mark, I didn't.
1) 485) dialog: If that's what you want.
1) 487) dialog: Okay then.
1) 491) dialog: He reads too many books. He has it in his head that after meeting three times, we should be able to have penetrative sex which results in simultaneous orgasm. Boom! Just like that.
1) 496) dialog: I guess. Yes, it is.
1) 500) dialog: I like him.
1) 518) dialog: Oh, nothing.
1) 520) dialog: Okay, I've been thinking about the whole conversion thing.
1) 523) dialog: Then, whatever it is, I guess I'm not in the mood for talking.
1) 525) dialog: Another sort of mood. They get into the business.
1) 529) dialog: Hullo, this is Cheryl. She smiles.
1) 530) dialog: Mark?
1) 534) dialog: I don't normally meet with clients outside of working hours, you know that.
1) 551) dialog: So, what shall we talk about?
1) 553) dialog: Then why are we here?
1) 555) dialog: I'm glad you enjoy looking, after all.
1) 557) dialog: Or so rich.
1) 559) dialog: No, as my husband. Why not go all the way.
1) 561) dialog: Does that shock you?
1) 563) dialog: Then I guess it would shock her as well.
1) 565) dialog: My old school friend that's going to come along any moment.
1) 567) dialog: As long as we're pretending, sure.
1) 574) dialog: That's another thing altogether. What I want to know is where do you get off opening my mail?
1) 576) dialog: Even less reason to open it. Where is it? Give it to me.
1) 578) dialog: This is absolutely none of your fucking business.
1) 580) dialog: You didn't.
1) 587) dialog: Mark appears to be indulging in typical transference behaviour. This is not unusual after first successful intercourse, but I think he is especially susceptible. He cannot help seeing me as the multi- functional, all-purpose woman, mother, sister, schoolmistress, whore, lover and best friend. At the same time, his anxiety about sexual performance has diminished.
1) 590) dialog: No, you didn't. I'm fine.
1) 592) dialog: Yes, I promise.
1) 595) dialog: Yes, I've come around to your point of view. You were right. You're generally right about these things.
1) 597) dialog: Josh, I need to go to sleep. Everything's good.
1) 602) dialog: Let me touch you with my words. For my hands lie limp as empty gloves. She goes over to the back steps, sits down and continues reading. She puts it back in the envelope and walks back inside th house. She is visibly affected.
1) 654) dialog: Don't you say that to all the girls?
1) 656) dialog: Remember about the breathing. Concentrate on breathing out rather than in. Think of anything neutral. Sky, water, trees, ships, music, nothing too dramatic. Mark closes his eyes.
1) 673) dialog: Mark achieved an erection as soon as I started to suck on him. He did the controlled breathing, as I had suggested, and I was able to get on top and guide him in quite easily.
1) 676) dialog: Yes, it's really in. We hear Mark's thoughts.
1) 687) dialog: I love you, too.
1) 689) dialog: Yes.
1) 691) dialog: Mark is breathing well and learning to pace himself. There is no real physical impediment to a variety of sexual activities, given the right sort of partner. His deeper emotional needs are outside the scope of my potential involvement. Cheryl pauses, then goes on.
1) 692) dialog: As anticipated, this was the final session. Tony appears. He seems to have some understanding of what going on. He and Cheryl hug.
1) 695) dialog: What happens when what?
1) 697) dialog: What people?
1) 699) dialog: Are you attracted to me?
1) 701) dialog: Hypothetically, they write poems, they have sex.
1) 703) dialog: After poetry and sex? Nothing or everything. The rest is by negotiation, as it were.
1) 705) dialog: I mean, you can just leave it at love and attraction, or you can make things complicated. As most people do.
1) 707) dialog: Oh, yes. 76.
1) 717) dialog: What shall we do next time? Any requests?
1) 719) dialog: Mark?
1) 721) text: She finishes buttoning him up in silence. A strange feeli a kind of chill that Cheryl senses, pervades the atmosphe
1) 723) dialog: That's right. Or...
1) 725) dialog: Or, we could stop now.
1) 727) dialog: Yes.
1) 729) text: What do you think we should do? CHERYL
1) 731) text: I want to know how you feel. CHERYL
1) 733) text: Yes, it does. I don't just write poems to anyone. CHERYL
1) 735) text: You mean to say, come the sixth session that will be it? CHERYL
1) 736) text: Yes, that will be it. I explained that the first time we met. Mark has a serious and painful moment. CHERYL (CONT'D)
1) 738) text: Then maybe we should pull the plug now. CHERYL
1) 741) dialog: Just a moment. She and Mark make eye contact for the last time. They man to smile at each other.
1) 743) dialog: Bye, Mark
1) 746) dialog: He did great. See you. I'm sorry, I have to run.
1) 751) dialog: I knew there was a reason I came here today. Vera waves goodbye as she goes and Cheryl sits contemplat the envelope in her lap. Then she tosses it onto the dash drives away.
2) 0) text: 156 Cheryl enters the room wrapped in a white, terry cloth ro The room is dominated by a small, beautifully tiled immer pool with a hand rail and steps. The MIKVAH LADY gets up her chair and approaches her.
2) 2) dialog: Yes, it is. I'm converting. She takes off her robe and hands it to the Mikvah Lady, w does not fail to notice Cheryl's body.
2) 4) dialog: I don't think you'd understand.
2) 6) dialog: Okay. I'm a housewife.
2) 8) dialog: I guess I was mistaken. Cheryl steps towards the pool.
2) 10) dialog: That has never been one of my problems.
2) 13) dialog: And it does? Cheryl takes another step into the water.
2) 16) dialog: Okay Mark, you can open your eyes now.
2) 18) dialog: This is your body. A few feet in front of Mark, Cheryl is holding a full-len mirror. The angle is such that he can see all of himself. is mesmerized by his own image. Flashes of light from the mirror flicker over his face.
2) 68) text: I know it's been awhile since we talked about this... About Cheryl. At the time, you seemed to feel so badly about her... or about it? MARK
