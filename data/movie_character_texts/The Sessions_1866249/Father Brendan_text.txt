0) 39) dialog: The Apostle Luke tells us that when Elizabeth spoke to Mary, the baby in her womb leapt - "For lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy". So Mary's fear and apprehension slowly gave way to pride and purpose. Elizabeth saw the greatness in Mary. "Blessed art thou among women". Elizabeth, pregnant herself with St. John, felt the power of this wondrous woman. It was Elizabeth, and her absolute faith, that gave Mary the courage she was lacking, and she gave thanks saying: "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour". May the spirit of the Lord be amongst you and remain with you always. Mass is over. PEOPLE come up to Mark and place a hand on head or chest and say, "God bless you." In the background can also hear Father Brendan.

0) 66) dialog: Well, it obviously troubles you.
0) 68) dialog: I really wouldn't worry too much about that. The question is whether you like having her around.

0) 73) dialog: Unofficially, yes.
0) 75) dialog: Please, if ever you feel I can be useful, do let me know. It was a pleasure talking with you.

0) 122) dialog: Sometimes people can be very shy about their emotions.
0) 125) dialog: Did it?
0) 127) dialog: I wish I knew what to say. I mean, welcome to the human race. Every day someone breaks someone else's heart. And as I said, I'm here for you. I just wish I had something more useful to offer. All I have are these vague ideas about life and death that priests are equipped with. Have you ever thought of discussing your feelings with a therapist?

1) 26) text: I think so. FATHER BRENDAN
1) 28) text: I did do my best on the question of marriage. Father Brendan shakes his head with concern. FATHER BRENDAN
1) 31) dialog: How do you know she's not some hooker gussied up as a social worker, who's just going to rob you?
1) 33) dialog: How old are you?
1) 35) dialog: Why exactly now?
1) 37) dialog: And this is what you want my advice about? Fornication?
1) 39) dialog: And do I have the casting vote, so to speak?
1) 41) dialog: You're serious, aren't you?
1) 45) dialog: And you want my opinion?

1) 341) dialog: Do you want to know what I think?
1) 343) dialog: I'd forget the psychobabble. I grew up on a farm. It even takes the animals a few times to get it right. Can I suggest you try and enjoy it more? Don't worry about the technical stuff. You're a poet. Be romantic.
1) 503) dialog: I was in the neighborhood. How are you?

1) 755) dialog: I'm sorry Mark, you can't always trust your feelings. You've achieved a great thing. It may take you a while to realize that. Time passes.
2) 65) text: Yep, I almost found out the big secret. But here I am, back with the living. If there is another place, then I think they took one look at me and decided to throw me back. FATHER BRENDAN
2) 67) text: And thank you for coming to visit. FATHER BRENDAN
2) 69) text: I no longer feel like that. Father Brendan is rather taken by surprise. FATHER BRENDAN
