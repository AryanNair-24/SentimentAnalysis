1) 59) text: Luke shakes his head. Willis is incorrigible. Finally he  reaches a tall redwood playset. He looks up the ladder. A SMALL BOY sits on the platform of the tower, arms aroun his knees, staring up at the stars. A telescope rests nea on a tripod. He looks lonely. Luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him. BOBBY, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at the sky.
1) 61) text: Luke is surprised by the question. A pause.
1) 62) dialog: Mommy will.
1) 64) text: His voice is unexpectedly fierce. He's fighting back tear Luke is moved. Another brief silence.
1) 65) dialog: Well, I'll tell you what. I've been  thinking about that. And what I  thought was -- how 'bout if I bring  along my own copy? (Bobby looks at him) Then every night, wherever I am,  I'll read a little bit more of it.  And I'll know that you and Mommy,  wherever you are, you're reading it  too. That way, it'll feel like we're  still reading it together. 'Cause I  don't know about you, but I'm pretty  anxious to find out how 'ol Ben Gunn  got marooned on that island. What  d'you say?
1) 66) text: Bobby manages a smile. He nods, feeling a little better.  Luke is proud of his son's courage.
1) 67) dialog: Good deal. Can I have a hug?
1) 68) text: Bobby's arms go around his father's neck. He hugs Luke  fiercely, and Luke hugs him back.

Its DRIVER is alo Luke's expression changes. Recognition, then happiness.

1) 83) text: The intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even Woody himself. Luke glances at McConnell. An awkward beat
1) 84) dialog: Then you've got a short memory. Think  back to how we were by the second  week of lunar training.
1) 86) dialog: (laughing) I'm trying to remember, let's see,  which one of us scored the lowest  ranking up there?
1) 88) dialog: Oh, man, three commanders, on the  same ship? If they sent us off to  Mars together, there wouldn't be  enough fuel to lift all those egos.
1) 91) dialog: Listen to him. Mr. Cover-of-Time  Magazine!
1) 93) dialog: Yeah, and who scored highest on the  lunar rankings?
1) 98) text: He pulls from his shirt a little Flash Gordon rocketship  emblem hanging on a chain, and waggles this tauntingly at McConnell, as Luke and McConnell laugh.
1) 100) text: Luke grabs Woody's arm to give McConnell a better shot at the emblem, but Woody cuffs his hands away, laughing.  McConnell, watching their horseplay, shakes his head.
1) 102) text: He tries to smile, but his face reddens. Then all at once his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emoti Woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but McCon shakes him off, rises abruptly. He turns his back on them walking away a few steps. Woody and Luke exchange a worried glance.
1) 104) dialog: Hey, Woodrow, isn't it about time  you donated this thing to a museum?
1) 107) text: Luke laughs. Woody looks at McConnell.
1) 110) text: Woody reaches out to shake Luke's hand.
1) 112) dialog: I'll see what I can do. Just make  sure you bring some fresh beer.
1) 114) text: With a final glance at McConnell, Woody slips the car int gear. McConnell and Luke watch as he drives away. A silen Luke glances at his old friend, growing more serious. We  sense he's been waiting all night for a chance to say thi
1) 115) dialog: Should've been your mission, Jim.  Yours and Maggie's.
1) 117) dialog: None of us ever wanted Mars the way  you two did. Not even Woody. Twelve  years of hoping for this assignment,  training for it --
1) 119) dialog: If Maggie hadn't gotten sick -- if  you hadn't pulled yourself out of  the rotation to take care of her --
1) 120) text: McConnell turns to him, his eyes flashing danger. He will not tolerate pity. Luke sees this but presses on.
1) 121) dialog: No, I'm gonna say this. I have to  say it... (pause) I wanted Mars One. Hell, I battled  you for it every step of the way.  Never wanted to beat anybody so bad  in my life. But not like this...  Jim, I'd give this all up in a second,  if it would bring Maggie back to us.
1) 124) dialog: (pause) Take care of yourself.
1) 126) text: Luke nods. They grab hands for a second, then let go. Luk walks back towards his house. McConnell watches him for a moment, then turns, walks over to his Jeep. He opens his  door, then pauses. He turns. Looks up at --
2) 11) dialog: Yeah, Renee.
2) 13) text: Luke, though reluctant to break off work, is intrigued.
2) 14) dialog: Copy that.
2) 15) text: As Luke turns away, headed for the rover
2) 20) dialog: What the hell is that?
2) 22) dialog: Where is it?
2) 23) text: Cote glances at the others. They're all smirking, as if t share some secret joke Luke's not yet in on.
2) 25) dialog: C'mon, what's so funny? Gimme the  coordinates.
2) 28) dialog: The Plains of Cydonia. So? (pause) Oh no. You're not telling me --
2) 29) text: They all laugh as the other shoe drops. Luke's expression incredulous, exasperated.
2) 32) text: Luke sits, taking over the Ares remote control from Cote. They all watch as he fine tunes the image, trying without success to coax more resolution.
2) 33) dialog: Great. That's great. The first anomaly  we hit, and it's gotta be in the one  place guaranteed to make NASA look  ridiculous... You know how many books  have been written about that damned  mountain?
2) 37) dialog: And all because a couple of lousy  impact craters happen to look like  eye sockets. If this gets out, we'll  have every UFO kook on Earth spouting  off on the six o'clock news... C'mon,  people, gimme a read here. Is that a  cinder cone?
2) 40) dialog: It's an upwelling, for sure. But  maybe not volcanic...
2) 41) text: The others look at him, puzzled. Luke leans in closer, wi growing excitement. He points to the screen.
2) 42) dialog: Look at the color. And see how shiny  it is? I could swear that's ice...
2) 45) text: They look at each other, Luke's excitement now leaping fr one to another of them. They're almost trembling.
2) 47) dialog: How far away is it?
2) 49) dialog: (considers a moment) Let's send a packet to Micker. Then  we'll go check it out.
3) 3) dialog: This is a truly anomalous formation.  Looks like nothing we've seen so  far. The structure appears to be  crystalline, at least from the angle  displayed by ARES-8 ...
3) 5) dialog: (grins) We're all trying not to go too nuts  up here, but -- we think there's a  good chance this could be an extrusion  from some subsurface, geothermal  column of water. And if we're right...
3) 7) dialog: ...then we've found the key to  permanent human colonization.
3) 13) dialog: Anyway, we'are going out to take a  closer look at it, try to get an  idea of its composition. (checks his watch) By the time you receive this, we  should be just about on-site.
3) 18) dialog: Anyone else hear that?
3) 21) dialog: Can you fix it?
3) 23) dialog: Big talker. Renee, Sergei, let's  break out the radar, see what this  thing's made of.
3) 37) dialog: ...anyway, that's about it. We'll  send another packet when we get back.
3) 38) text: Cote clears her throat, gives Luke a look. The others can barely conceal their grins.
3) 39) dialog: Oh, right. One more thing. Today is  a very special day for a good friend  of ours, and I know he's there right  now.
3) 40) text: McConnell looks at the screen, worried. What's Luke up to
3) 41) dialog: Now, he hates it when any fuss is  made, so I won't mention his name...
3) 43) dialog: ...because the last thing in the  world I'd ever want to do is embarrass  someone like Jim McConnell.
3) 45) dialog: C'mon, you Micker weasels, sing!
3) 47) dialog: (sings a line, then,  to CAMERA:) Hey, Ray! Take a look at him! Is he  all red with one of those fake "I'm- a-good-sport" grins?
3) 49) dialog: And hey, you guys, check out Ray!  Does he have on one of his "This- wasn't-in-my-mission-plan" faces?
3) 51) dialog: Nothing you can do about it, Ray!  We're a hundred million miles away!
3) 52) text: Luke and the crew finish singing the song. Luke raises th cupcake in a toast.
3) 53) dialog: Happy Birthday, Jimbo! Make a wish!
3) 55) dialog: Catch you again soon. Take care,  buddy. End of transmission.
3) 56) text: Luke reaches out, turns OFF the CAMERA, and the display s GOES BLACK. Beck turns, his gaze locking with McConnell's. He's annoy as if this violation of protocol were somehow McConnell's fault. McConnell returns his stare coolly.
3) 58) dialog: Well? What's under there?
3) 60) dialog: What?
3) 62) text: Luke doesn't understand. He walks up to look at the displ screen.
3) 64) dialog: That doesn't make any sense. You're  reading a vein of ore.
3) 66) text: The deep pulsing tone continues. Luke frowns.
3) 67) dialog: Nick, could the problem with the  antenna be interfering?
3) 69) dialog: (to Cote and Kirov) Try it closer and up the power. I'll  watch the screen.
3) 73) dialog: Nick, how we coming on that antenna?
3) 75) text: Cote and Kirov are having some trouble with the switches the radar gun. They turn towards Luke and Willis.
3) 77) text: Willis looks at Luke. Luke nods -- Go help them. Willis s towards the radar gun.
3) 82) text: Luke sidles over to the display screen on the rover.
3) 83) dialog: Okay. Crank up the juice and let's  see what's in this sucker.
3) 89) dialog: Looks up from the display screen. A puzzled expression.
3) 90) dialog: Why did that stop?
3) 109) dialog: Barely conscious, as he watches, for a horrifying final  instant, as...
4) 52) dialog: ...make this quick... may be only ch-- (long section of static) ...to the site, when we... hit us  just as we... --thers are all dead...
4) 54) dialog: (following more static) ...low sound that we couldn't  understand. Then all of a sudden  there was this terrib... (another long burst  of static) ...--stems are holding up for now,  but I don't know how long I can...
4) 237) dialog: Jim's first ship was seriously  underpowered...
4) 245) dialog: When they met at the Air Force  Academy, it was "love at first  flight."
4) 249) dialog: But Maggie, as you can see, kept him  on a short leash. Until...
4) 255) dialog: Today we celebrate a new chapter in  their story. And guys, it's a pretty  historic one.
4) 258) text: CHEERS at this, repeats of "Jim and Maggie!" Luke grins,  giving a little signal, and we see
4) 260) dialog: When you guys land, it'll prove once  and for all there's no intelligent  life on Mars.
6) 63) text: We see a flash of uncertainty in Luke's eyes. Then he yan his arm free, and his hammer arcs up even higher, tremble in the air.
6) 64) dialog: You're not here!
6) 66) dialog: No, no, you're not... you can't be  here.
6) 68) text: As he stares down at McConnell, Luke's eyes finally light with recognition. but before he can move, he is seized fr behind and flung backwards to the ground, the hammer ripp from his grasp, as Terri and Phil pinion his arms. McConn scrambles to his feet.
6) 70) text: McConnell kneels beside Luke, signalling to Terri and Phi that it's okay to let him go. They stand back, pulling of their helmets. Everyone is panting, out of breath. Luke sits up, slowly studying their features, one after  another, as if still not quite certain whether they might vanish. His voice is hoarse, rusty from disuse.
6) 71) dialog: Phil... Terri...
6) 72) text: Luke looks with incomprehension at McConnell.
6) 73) dialog: Jim... I don't understand. You're  not supposed to be here... Why are  you here? Where's Woody?
6) 75) text: Luke stares at McConnell, trying to absorb everything. He looks to Terri, who looks down.
6) 76) dialog: Oh no.
6) 77) text: Luke shakes his head in dismay. He seems to shrink in on  himself. It's all too much for him to take in. McConnell  kneels and puts his arm around Luke, comforting him.
6) 81) text: A flash of fear in Luke's eyes.
6) 82) dialog: (whispers) We fired the radar. It came. They  all died.
6) 84) dialog: They all died, but I was spared.  Why? Had to be for a reason. Then,  all of a sudden, I knew why I was  spared.
6) 86) dialog: So somebody would be left to figure  out the secret.
6) 89) dialog: Come. Comecomecome.
6) 94) text: McConnell and Terri follow in the direction Luke went. Ph trailing, mutters to himself.
6) 97) dialog: So... let me be sure I understand  this. Your ship blew up, with all  its supplies. Then you emptied the  cargo out of the REMO, and it was  totalled on landing. You've got no  food, no water, no spare oxygen,  nothing but what I see here...?
6) 98) text: McConnell and the others are silent, embarrassed. Then  McConnell nods. Luke looks at him, a cracked grin.
6) 99) dialog: What kinda rescue mission is this?
6) 101) text: He points to the computer repair case, as Phil lifts it o a sledge. Luke turns, looks at the case, then Phil.
6) 103) dialog: (softly) Four.
6) 105) dialog: Terri... I'm so sorry. He was a good  man.
6) 107) dialog: When there's time, we'll talk.
6) 109) dialog: This way.
6) 112) dialog: ...When I came to and dug myself out  of the sand, my faceplate was cracked.  Leaking badly. I barely made it back  to Base. It was weeks before I could  work up the nerve to go back out  there and look for their...
6) 114) dialog: Renee was the only one I could find.  But it didn't seem right, somehow,  to dig just one grave.
6) 115) text: There is an emotional silence. Luke turns, takes a few st He stares into the distance, observing the swirling dust  around them. McConnell hesitates, notices Luke's gaze.
6) 117) text: Luke looks off into the distance, studies something only seems to see.
6) 118) dialog: If it holds course.
6) 119) text: McConnell pulls his gaze away from the horizon, looks at  Luke.
6) 121) dialog: You don't believe me. That's okay.  But I'm not crazy, Jim.
6) 124) dialog: (pause) You better see for yourselves.
6) 128) dialog: See, where they made their mistake  was, they must've planned for it to  be visible from Earth...
6) 129) text: The others turn, looking at him. Luke is aiming an electr space heater at his computer. As the coils glow red, he r his hands together, poised over the keyboard.
6) 131) text: Luke reacts to their blank stares. He has a kind of jitte feverish intensity, a secret excitement.
6) 132) dialog: Don't you understand? Hundreds of  millions of years have gone by. You've  got erosion, sand storms, lava flows,  meteor impacts -- hell, in that much  time, the whole surface would've  changed. So no wonder we never saw  it before. Well, I mean, we saw it,  but not like they meant us too. Too  much dirt on it.
6) 135) dialog: This.
6) 141) dialog: I don't know. But whatever it is,  somebody built it. And not us.
6) 144) dialog: Good, Jim, good. That's the key.
6) 146) dialog: Hear the pauses? That's what made me  realize it's a pattern -- a repeating  pattern.
6) 148) text: Luke is trembling with excitement. His words tumble out v quickly. He's been waiting so long to share this.
6) 149) dialog: That's what I thought. There are  distinct blocks in the pattern, and  within each block the tones come in  groups of three. Threethreethree.  For months I struggled to analyze  it, trying different constructs...  Then I thought about dimensions.
6) 151) dialog: Right! Three groups equals three  dimensions... So I tried assigning  different graphic values to each  block, group and tone. And finally I  got... this.
6) 157) dialog: You see it, too. Thank God. I was  afraid I was just suffering from a  form of asphyxia.
6) 160) dialog: My guess is, it's a signature. A  self-portrait of whatever species  created the Face.
6) 174) dialog: Like I just got back my other three  percent.
6) 177) dialog: Good work, Terri.
6) 180) text: Luke and Terri smile. McConnell scoops up the fallen M&am He slows down as he does it, looking at the scatter of li round CANDIES. Something tugging at the back of his mind.
6) 187) dialog: (puzzled) What?
6) 189) text: Luke and Terri stare at him.
6) 192) dialog: But why?
6) 194) text: Terri and Luke look at each other, starting to understand
6) 195) dialog: We fired radar into that thing.  Concentrated sound waves...
6) 201) dialog: I think so, yes.
6) 203) text: Luke stares at him, startled by what he's implying.
6) 215) dialog: (quietly) We don't have to go out there. There's  a better way.
6) 219) dialog: Checking video feed...
6) 221) dialog: There!
6) 225) dialog: I'm not sure. Maybe we better stop  by that boulder.
6) 232) dialog: It worked... It worked!
6) 234) text: Luke punches buttons, waits anxiously for a readout.
6) 235) dialog: Normal. Seismic... normal. Anemometer  steady. No sign of the vortex.
6) 238) dialog: Or another test...
6) 247) dialog: An hour? Maybe less.
6) 249) dialog: A storm like that? It could go  planetary. And last a year.
6) 251) dialog: It'll sock us in, Jim. We won't be  able to take off. If that happens,  with what few supplies we've got  left...? We'll starve to death.
6) 256) text: He looks a question at Luke and Terri, one after the othe Their eyes, tense but excited, signal agreement.
6) 265) text: McConnell nods, satisfied. Looks at Terri and Luke.
6) 279) text: Terri and Luke exchange a tense glance.
6) 282) text: Luke smiles. The three of them stare into the portal.  McConnell, between the others, reaches out and grips each them by a gloved hand. They take a sort of collective bre Then they walk forward together, into the light.
6) 285) dialog: Roger that. Texture is smooth.
6) 287) text: Behind them, there is an abrupt WHOOOSH, like a giant air sealing shut. They turn, startled and nervous. Letting go each other's hands, Luke and Terri run back the way they  came, but almost immediately are stopped by a wall of som sort. The vast hangar-type door has closed behind them.
6) 302) dialog: Jim, seal it!
6) 304) text: Luke looks at his sleeve. McConnell's right.
6) 309) dialog: Otherwise known as air?
6) 310) text: Terri nods. McConnell starts unscrewing his helmet ring.  Luke follows suit.
6) 323) dialog: Yeah. It's Mars.
6) 343) dialog: We're Martians...?
6) 346) text: McConnell and Luke look at her.
6) 348) dialog: They seeded Earth.
6) 363) text: Terri looks at Luke, alarmed.
6) 364) dialog: He's right.
6) 366) text: She scoops up Luke's helmet, tosses it to him. As he catc it, she's already starting back out, in the direction the came from, and Luke follows her. Until they both become a that McConnell isn't with them. They turn back. He's stil rooted to the spot, his gaze locked on the indigo core of the colored rings.
6) 367) dialog: Jim...
6) 369) dialog: Jim, we gotta go.
6) 375) text: He looks into their faces. Terri is trying to grasp this  idea, still incredulous. Luke has the beginning of a half smile.
6) 377) text: Luke nods at the memory of Maggie's words. Terri remember too. McConnell's passionate conviction is affecting them  both.
6) 379) text: Terri looks at Luke. Luke is smiling. He understands.
6) 381) text: Luke steps closer, looking at his old friend.
6) 382) dialog: I once felt like I was taking your  turn. But now I think maybe you're  taking mine. Guess I'm a little  jealous.
6) 384) dialog: Thanks for saving my life.
6) 386) text: Luke nods, deeply moved. He turns away, picking up his he as Terri comes closer, looking at McConnell, a long unspo beat. Her eyes are glistening.
6) 392) text: McConnell smiles. Terri smiles back at him. Then she turn picks up her helmet, and crosses to where Luke has paused looking back.
6) 393) dialog: Hey, Jim...?
6) 395) dialog: Have a great ride.
6) 397) text: Luke and Terri exchange a final silent farewell with him, then hurry away, into the darkness.
6) 403) dialog: Phil? Phil, do you read? (to Terri) He's not reading.
6) 429) text: Luke looks over alarmed.
6) 432) dialog: I'll try to keep on a straight line!  It's our only chance.
6) 439) dialog: (very faint) Save the fuel, Phil. We're coming  in.
6) 447) dialog: Tell you on the way. Let's go!
7) 24) text: Luke nods. Their eyes are glistening. Luke's voice is a  whisper, both of prayer and farewell.
7) 25) dialog: Godspeed Jim McConnell.
