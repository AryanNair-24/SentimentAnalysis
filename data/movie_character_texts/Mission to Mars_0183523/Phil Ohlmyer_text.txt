1) 7) text: Derisive GROANS from the kids, more SHOUTS. Phil grins.  There's little danger NASA will ever use him on a recruit poster: he's messy, very hyper. Phil waves his hands for  silence.

Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of  balloons. We hear snatches of MUSIC, mostly country-flavo from dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees are being tos about.

4) 189) dialog: There.
4) 192) dialog: What the hell are those?

Debris in every direction, NEAT SPIRALS of it now, droppe uncannily into place, like some massive earth sculpture. if - but this makes no sense -- it had been swirled towar a LARGE CRATER.

4) 208) text: Phil tweaks the stylus, but the image won't clear up.
4) 210) text: Phil works the keyboard.
4) 213) dialog: Must be a problem with SIMA. I don't  see how an earthquake, six months  ago, could give us this kind of  distortion.

4) 334) dialog: Losing pressure fast! We're gonna  decompress!
4) 337) dialog: If we get below 20% atmosphere, the  power will shut down!
4) 339) dialog: Positive! A vacuum inside the ship  would cause a total electrical  failure. The nav computers will fry!
4) 341) text: Just then a computer screen flickers, freezes. Phil punch keys with his good hand. What he sees shocks him.

4) 363) text: McConnell looks at her, knows she's right. But he starts anyway. Phil reaches out his good hand.
4) 364) dialog: Jim, I've got an idea. If you guys  can save enough atmosphere, I'll  disconnect the power in the main  computer bay, then jump start the  systems. I'll do a hard boot.
4) 365) text: This is a radical, incredibly risky notion. McConnell sta hard at Phil. So does Terri.
4) 367) dialog: Are you kidding? These machines are  much too valuable.

5) 76) dialog: Shit!
5) 80) dialog: Get back in here, guys!
5) 94) text: McConnell looks at him, understands. Terri sits nearby, where she has just finished stitching Phil's hand. As Woody goes to her, she rises from her sea and looks at him tears of relief and pride in her eyes.
5) 97) text: He scoops her into his arms; they kiss passionately. Phil is blinking; something seems to be getting into his eyes. His voice catches for a moment.

5) 100) text: Terri separates from Woody, looks down at Phil.
5) 102) text: Phil starts curling up his fingers. The middle digit rema extended in the universal gesture. They all consider this for a moment. Then Phil looks up cheerfully.

5) 147) text: Phil punches buttons. ON THE SCREEN a second ellipse appe a blinking orange dot labelled "REMO." It appears to be s intersecting with their own trajectory.
5) 148) dialog: Uh, it's close...
5) 150) dialog: (shaken) I-I don't know. It'll take time...
5) 152) text: Phil frantically types in commands on the computer.
5) 156) dialog: You want us to transfer in suits?
5) 159) dialog: One kilometer, that's the best I can  do!
5) 171) dialog: (softly, sadly) Earth.
5) 182) dialog: We're going to miss her.
5) 244) dialog: It has to work!
5) 257) dialog: Oh Jesus, look! The ship!
5) 258) text: Phil points. McConnell and Terri look.

5) 352) text: Phil looks up at him dully.
5) 354) text: After a moment Phil releases his strap, pushes towards  McConnell. He stares numbly at the monitor for a few beat then takes the little computer from McConnell. He begins tap the keys, slowly at first, but then with more confide

6) 38) dialog: I've got ERV access. I'm going in.  Terri, you okay?

6) 91) dialog: Is it just me? Or is he about two  mealpacks short of a picnic?
6) 95) dialog: Greatgreatgreat.
6) 101) text: He points to the computer repair case, as Phil lifts it o a sledge. Luke turns, looks at the case, then Phil.
6) 102) dialog: Check it out. New nav boards for the  ERV. I got four round-trip tickets,  baby, right in here.
6) 139) dialog: Jesus...
6) 155) dialog: My God... Is that what I think it  is?
6) 159) dialog: So, okay, so -- somebody left this  thing here, somebody -- other than  human. But what the hell is it?
6) 165) dialog: Or Jack the Ripper.
6) 178) text: McConnell, rummaging through Phil's backpack, drops an al opened bag of M&amp;Ms. The CANDIES scatter and bounce al the floor.

6) 231) dialog: Oh my God...
6) 236) dialog: I don't know what we did, but guys --  does that look to you like a hostile  gesture?

6) 258) dialog: Go back... alone?
6) 260) dialog: Jim --
6) 262) dialog: (reluctantly) I understand. But --
6) 264) dialog: If you're not back by 1950, I prep  and launch.
6) 267) text: They start towards the four-man rover. Dust is swirling m thickly through the air, and the WIND IS LOUDER NOW. Phil stands watching them go, a lone, rather forlorn figure.

6) 278) dialog: (pause) Copy that.
6) 293) dialog: Computers are online! Ready to load  software. But guys -- we're losing  visibility here.
6) 295) dialog: Guys...? Jim? Luke? Terri? Is anyone  there...?
6) 296) text: No answer. Phil stares at his radio in dread.
