1) 26) text: DR. TERRI FISHER, early 30s, passes by with a platter of  corn-on-the-cob. Short, sturdy body, a face made attracti by its alert, questing intelligence. She pauses to kiss  Woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between th Then she glances at Kirov, all business now.
1) 31) text: The other men ooooh at this, busting on Kirov and Cote, a Terri moves on. Woody, watching her go, has a thousand-wa grin.
1) 32) dialog: You wanna know the sad part?  Technically I outrank her. But if we  want any peace at all on Mars Two,  I'm gonna be saying a lot of "Yes,  dears."

1) 89) dialog: (laughs) Bullshit, we would've made a great  crew.

4) 9) dialog: Honey, do you mind? I've got a  catastrophic power failure here.
4) 12) dialog: I danced with you at our wedding.
4) 14) dialog: Face it, honey, some couples dance,  some go to Mars. That's life.
4) 16) dialog: If they see me dance, they'll know  there's something wrong.
4) 25) dialog: Phil, c'mon! We just started this  drill.
4) 27) text: Woody and Terri exchange a worried look. What's wrong?
4) 33) dialog: What do you mean, "intense"?
4) 38) dialog: What about the REMO? It went into  Mars orbit last week. Maybe that  could give us some clue.
4) 49) dialog: Show us whatever you've got.
4) 53) text: Woody, Terri and Phil look at each other -- Oh, God.
4) 58) text: Woody and his crew stare at the screen, stunned. This is catastrophe almost too huge to grasp.
4) 65) dialog: But that energy pulse they picked up  in New Mexico...
4) 67) dialog: (incredulous) Causing this kind of damage? I don't  buy it. We're missing something here.
4) 68) text: McConnell and Woody exchange a glance... Woody's right.
4) 71) dialog: Other than the computers, how do we  think the ERV fared?
4) 73) dialog: Which means it's gonna be up to us  to get new motherboards, drives, and  software to Mars. As fast as we can.
4) 77) dialog: Luke needs us now.
4) 82) dialog: Good idea Phil. If SIMA tells us  Luke hasn't survived and it's not  safe to land, we swing around Mars  and come right back home.
4) 91) dialog: He's right, Ray. We've got a real  shot.
4) 92) text: A pause with beck weighing the odds. He looks at Woody.
4) 95) text: He looks at Woody, Phil and Terri, who are just as eager.
4) 97) text: McConnell exits followed by Terri and Phil, but as Beck s out, too, Woody stops him.
4) 98) dialog: Chief, could I have a word?
4) 102) dialog: I've no longer got the right crew.
4) 104) dialog: Bjornstrom is a geologist. He's good,  but not for this. My people just  lost eight months of training. This  is a different mission, with a  different objective.
4) 106) dialog: But when you are, it ought to be  given the best chance for success. I  want McConnell to fly right seat.
4) 109) dialog: Yeah. Because you washed him out.
4) 111) dialog: Ray, he's the best pilot I ever saw,  and you've got him benched at a desk.
4) 113) dialog: Maggie was his wife. He didn't want  to lie on a couch and share her with  strangers.
4) 115) dialog: His wife wasted away in front of his  eyes. What was he supposed to do?  Suck it up? Get with the program?  What was his crime? That he was upset?  That he cried...?
4) 117) text: Beck and Woody stare at each other. A long tense beat.
4) 119) text: This stops Woody, just for a beat. Then makes him press o harder, with even greater intensity.
4) 120) dialog: When Maggie died, yeah, it knocked  the shit out of him. It knocked the  hell out of all of us. But you know  and I know that he's still the best  we've got. He and Maggie wrote the  book on Mars. He's got more hours in  the sims than the rest of us put  together. Ray, we can do this. Give  me McConnell as co-pilot, and we  will bring Luke home. And that's a  promise.
4) 150) dialog: Take a look.
4) 154) dialog: What do you make of that?
4) 156) dialog: Headed for Chryse Planitia.
4) 158) text: McConnell pulls back from the screen, looks at Woody.
4) 159) dialog: We'll have to be ready to move fast.  Maybe even advance our ETA. Those  things can cover the whole planet,  and last up to a year.
4) 162) dialog: Tomorrow morning, about 0600. That's  when we find out whether we came all  this way for nothing.
4) 163) text: They exchange a glance. Woody's right, but the thought is too terrible to dwell on. McConnell looks back at Mars.
4) 176) dialog: Zero-G. My last chance to be graceful.  Once we're in Mars gravity, it's  back to shuffling my feet and grabbing  her butt.
4) 181) text: They all look at each other. This is it! Woody spins over a console, shuts off the music.
4) 185) dialog: Looks deserted.
4) 201) dialog: Check the radiation levels.
4) 204) dialog: Go to the disaster site.
4) 209) dialog: Go to infrared.
4) 216) dialog: Then what the hell was it?
4) 240) dialog: Maggie was always starstruck...
4) 247) dialog: After that, NASA training was tough.  All Jim could think about was  exploring a heavenly body. More ribald  LAUGHTER, as

4) 253) dialog: Stands in the doorway of his cubicle. Their eyes meet. Th both smile, turning back to the video. Remembering.
4) 257) dialog: Let's hear it for the newly-announced  Captain and Co-Captain of Mars One.  To Jim and Maggie!
4) 275) dialog: You okay?
4) 277) text: Woody glances at him. It's true. Rather than being sadden McConnell seems to have taken on new strength. A renewed  sense of wonder.
4) 279) text: Woody nods, smiles.
4) 280) dialog: You know what? She may have been  right.
4) 282) dialog: If that wasn't a quake down there,  then something else caused it. Or  planned it... You're thinking the  same thing.
4) 284) dialog: Jesus. You realize what this means?
4) 287) dialog: Yeah, and we're not leaving until we  find out... Deal?
4) 289) dialog: Maggie was the best of us.
4) 290) text: McConnell looks at him, silent but grateful. Woody goes.  McConnell turns back, looking at her smiling face, frozen the screen.
4) 294) dialog: Okay, people let's look sharp. If we  overshoot, there's no coming back.
4) 296) text: In the cockpit, Woody and McConnell are in the pilot and pilot's wearing space suits but not yet helmets. AS CAMER PULLS BACK AND AWAY, we see them making instrument adjust in preparation for MOI.

4) 335) dialog: Computer, how long until zero  atmosphere?
4) 343) text: Woody looks back at his crew, struggling to project more  calm than he really feels.
4) 344) dialog: Everybody switch to suit oxygen. We  beat this in the simulator, we can  do it here. Jim, you've got the ship.  I'm going EVA.
4) 346) dialog: C'mon, people, let's go! Let's work  the problem!
5) 2) dialog: (over radio) Jim, how we doin' on the AG?
5) 15) dialog: Get some light on the hole so I can  locate it.
5) 19) dialog: I'm topside, Jim, do you know which  sector?
5) 22) dialog: Jesus, uh, OK, this is gonna be like  searching for a needle in a haystack.
5) 30) dialog: C'mon, c'mon, where are you...?
5) 35) dialog: Copy, I' heading there now.
5) 38) dialog: (to himself, marveling) Sonofabitch. You never did that in  the simulator.
5) 47) dialog: (to himself) Whoa.
5) 82) dialog: Jim, there's a lot of scarring...  I'd better check for other punctures  while I'm out here.
5) 84) dialog: (a beat; reluctantly) Copy, I'm heading there now.
5) 85) text: Woody jets back towards the open EVA hatch. But as he rea this, about to re-enter the ship, he's captured momentari by a breathtakingly beautiful sight below him.
5) 87) dialog: Stares down at Mars, enthralled, as sunlight floods the s of the spaceship, sparkles off his visor. Dawn, after a v long night indeed. He whispers lovingly, under his breath
5) 88) dialog: Hey, Beautiful...
5) 93) dialog: (whispers) Know what? You've got enough left.
5) 94) text: McConnell looks at him, understands. Terri sits nearby, where she has just finished stitching Phil's hand. As Woody goes to her, she rises from her sea and looks at him tears of relief and pride in her eyes.
5) 96) dialog: Well. Easier than the cha-cha.
5) 100) text: Terri separates from Woody, looks down at Phil.
5) 107) dialog: OK, we're ready to light this candle.  Go/No Go for braking burn and MOI.  Engines?
5) 110) dialog: Systems.
5) 112) dialog: Nav.
5) 114) dialog: We are Go for the burn. I'm fueling  the engines.
5) 120) text: Woody hesitates, then glances at McConnell.
5) 121) dialog: Jim?
5) 127) dialog: What the --
5) 129) text: He and Woody both reach out, straining against the incred G-forces, and manage to grab a red emergency lever, yanki it down hard.
5) 132) dialog: Engines negative! No response! I've  got no attitude control!
5) 134) dialog: Negative! The CM doesn't have enough  thrust to correct this rotation!
5) 141) dialog: How much time've we got?
5) 153) dialog: Jim, we're dead stick, there's no  way to maneuver this ship into a  link-up!
5) 160) text: They stare at Woody. We feel the full, terrible weight of his responsibility. Four lives hang on his call.
5) 161) dialog: Prepare to abandon ship.
5) 164) dialog: On my mark, seven percent left  thruster. Three, two, one, fire.
5) 165) text: All four astronauts fire a brief, simultaneous burst from the tiny attitude control thrusters in their suits. This  stops their rotation, bringing their travel under control The ship continues spinning in the background. Woody takes a final look at the charred, doomed Mars Reco The only home they've known for six months. He exchanges silent glance with the others. They all expect to be dead the next few minutes. Woody takes a breath, nods.
5) 166) dialog: Okay. Let's go.
5) 167) text: He pops the big thrusters on the MMU and starts heading a from the ship. The cord between Woody and the others pull taut and they start to follow.
5) 168) text: Of Woody leading them away from the crippled spaceship,  against the magnificent backdrop of the blood-red planet  below. Four tiny figures, all alone in space.
5) 175) text: Woody eyes a small display screen on his forearm.
5) 176) dialog: I'm at fifty percent. (looking down) But I don't see the REMO.
5) 181) dialog: Jesus. She's not where I thought  she'd be.
5) 183) dialog: Looks again at his display screen, frustrated.
5) 185) dialog: We can't catch it. Not like this.
5) 187) text: From a compartment on the side of the MMU, Woody pulls ou
5) 190) dialog: It'll be better if I leave you the  gun while I run out to the REMO.  I've got enough fuel left for that.
5) 192) dialog: I'll aim to overshoot, then brake  like hell; arc it in.
5) 193) text: McConnell looks at him. They both know how risky this is, and they also know it's their only chance. Woody flips a  switch on the gun and pulls on the hook. Off it comes,  trailing wire. Woody clips the hook to the MMU, then hand McConnell the gun.
5) 194) dialog: Seeya in a few.
5) 195) text: McConnell nods. Woody and Terri exchange a look -- tender loving -- then Woody turns around and fires the MMU jets full throttle. As Woody pulls away, line unspools from th tether gun.
5) 197) dialog: Okay. I'm on path to overshoot. I'm  gonna take the edge off.
5) 198) text: Woody starts braking with the MMU thrusters as hard as he can.
5) 201) dialog: I'm out. Coming in hot. Still long. (beat) Abandoning the unit. I'll brake with  suit jets.

5) 208) dialog: Suit jets gone. But I'm gonna make  contact...
5) 212) dialog: Impact's gonna be a little rough.
5) 214) dialog: (beat) Thirty-two.
5) 217) dialog: No! You slow me and I'll fall short.
5) 219) dialog: No choice. I'll be okay. Here we  go...
5) 223) dialog: Tries to hold onto the tether line but his momentum is to much.
5) 225) dialog: Slides over the hull of the REMO.
5) 227) dialog: Is past the REMO, freefalling toward Mars.
5) 231) dialog: Tries his suit jets again -- they're empty.
5) 236) dialog: (after a beat) Uh, well, no suit jets and I'm still  carrying a good deal of velocity.
5) 238) dialog: (after a beat) Uh, I'd have to say negative on that,  Jim.
5) 240) dialog: No, I heard you. Negative on the  maneuver. I am not retrievable.
5) 243) dialog: It comes down to the amount of fuel,  honey. The suit jets were designed  for attitude control, not travel.  Retrieval just won't work.
5) 245) dialog: Hey, believe me, I don't like it any  more than you do.
5) 247) dialog: Run the numbers, Jim.
5) 251) dialog: Sounds good, Jim.

5) 282) dialog: Terri, what are you doing?
5) 285) dialog: Terri --
5) 290) dialog: No. I wouldn't come for you. Not if  it just wasn't possible.
5) 292) dialog: No, Terri, you can't! You don't have  enough fuel to get me, stop us both,  and get us back. Hell, you come any  farther and you won't have enough to  get back yourself.
5) 294) dialog: Listen to me, goddammit! You have to  stop! You have to stop now!
5) 302) dialog: Okay, honey...? You gotta go back  now.
5) 306) dialog: Watches as it comes shooting down toward him.
5) 308) dialog: Looks at the drifting hook, ten agonizing meters away fro him. His only life preserver.
5) 310) dialog: What are you doing?
5) 312) dialog: Terri, you spend any fuel getting  closer, you won't get back, and if  anyone tries to get you, they'll die  too.
5) 315) dialog: Honey, please go back. Go back and  help everyone get down to the surface.
5) 318) dialog: I can't let you do it. I can't. I'm  sorry.

5) 325) text: Ice crystals bloom with Woody's last breath. There's noth to suck in. He doesn't fight it. He lets death come.
6) 104) text: In some mysterious way, this reminder of Woody's death se to bring him fully back into himself. He takes Terri by t shoulders, deeply saddened. She meets his gaze.
