A FLURRY of SHADOWS dances on the wall beyond the boy, revealing the presence of others, unseen, in an adjoining room. As Harry advances, LOW VOICES emanate from the shadows. As he reaches the boy, Harry speaks in a WHISPER:
78) 1) dialog: Excuse me. Could you tell me where I am? Hello...? The boy doesn't respond, eyes staked to the activity in the adjoining room... which Harry sees now is the Entrance Hall. A group of ELDER WITCHES and WIZARDS -- Hogwarts Professors -- talk amongst themselves, then... abruptly go silent. Make way for two YOUNG WIZARDS, bearing a STRETCHER.

88) 6) dialog: We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him. But if he did set the monster loose last time -- even by accident -- he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. And that's a start.
88) 8) dialog: I think it's time to get my Dad's old Cloak out again.

92) 3) dialog: Are you okay? Hagrid? Did you hear about Hermione?
92) 5) dialog: Look... we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets? Hagrid takes a fruit cake, stops, about to answer, when... there is a LOUD KNOCK. The fruitcake SMASHES to the floor. Panicked, Harry and Ron throw the cloak over themselves. Sweating, Hagrid grabs his crossbow, points it at the door.
92) 35) dialog: Look... At the windowsill, a TRAIL OF SPIDERS escapes through a crack in the glass. Harry grabs Hagrid's LANTERN.
92) 36) dialog: C'mon. 115 thru 118 119 120 121 103.
93) 0) text: Harry illuminates the TRAIL OF SPIDERS. They run from the window to the ground, to the dark trees in the near distance. As Harry moves to follow, Ron hesitates.

94) 6) dialog: It's been here all the time! Look at it. The Forest has turned it wild. Harry nods, then glances back up the slope.
94) 7) dialog: C'mon, we don't want to lose the trail.
95) 0) text: Harry and Ron enter a hollow ribboned with shadows. Enormous trees tower over them, strewn with strands of white webbing. Ron steps on a strand, kicks it off queasily. Harry peers up ahead: at the far end of the hollow, the spiders stream toward a DARK OPENING. As Harry and Ron approach the opening, a CLICKING SOUND emanates from within, ECHOING in the branches of the tall trees. GROWING LOUDER. Ron falters, glancing about nervously.
95) 2) dialog: Don't panic. As Harry steps to the mouth of the cavern, the AIR suddenly CRACKLES with MOVEMENT. TWIGS SNAP. A HUGE SHADOW emerges, slowly engulfs Harry. He peers up.
95) 6) dialog: (breathing finally) Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's. And you... you're... (as it comes to him) ... Aragog, aren't you? (CONTINUED )
95) 10) dialog: He's in trouble. Up at school, there've been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he's opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before. As Harry talks, Ron's eyes dart warily about, then... RON'S POV - a pair of long legs -- SPIDER'S LEGS -- curl slowly around the trunk of the tree to his left. Terrified, Ron NUDGES Harry, but Harry ignores him.
95) 12) dialog: But if Hagrid never... that means... you're not the monster.
95) 15) dialog: Shhh! (to Aragog) But if you're not the monster, what did kill that girl fifty years ago?
95) 17) dialog: But have you seen it? (CONTINUED )

95) 22) dialog: Well... thank you. We'll just go...
95) 29) dialog: Let's go! Harry, Ron and Fang LEAP INSIDE. Ron SHIFTS FRANTICALLY. A SPIDER appears at Harry's open window.
95) 30) dialog: 
96) 0) text: The Anglia jets out of the hollow, lands with a THUD. Harry turns. The other spider is PULLING RON from the car. Harry points his wand, utters a spell and a BLINDING FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT BLASTS the spider into the shadows whipping past.
96) 6) dialog: Don't mention it. They stop. Both hear it: a DISTANT CLICKING. As the car flies over a ridge, they see them: a SEA OF SPIDERS heading straight for them like a herd of raging wildebeest. Ron puts his foot to the floor, SPINS the wheel and sends the car sliding away. The spiders STAMPEDE after.
97) 0) text: The Anglia SLALOMS through the forest, skimming past trees as the spiders CHARGE after. Harry peers ahead, SEES an area of FALLEN TREES. There is an OPENING, one narrow escape route.
97) 1) dialog: That way! It's the only way out! (looking back) Hurry! They're catching up! Ron JAMS the accelerator... just as a GIANT TARANTULA drops in front of the escape route. Harry and Ron are as good as dead.
97) 2) dialog: Can you get us in the air?
98) 0) text: As they LAND, Fang bolts free. Harry and Ron exit the CAR wearily, then watch it turn and RUMBLE BACK INTO THE FOREST. (CONTINUED )

99) 0) text: Madam Pomfrey bars the door, frowns at Harry and Ron.
99) 7) dialog: Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever... Just then, the mirror in Ron's hand CATCHES the LATE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT and casts a jagged FLAME across Hermione's hand. Harry watches the light dance over her fingers... then looks closer. Sees the paper clutched there.
100) 0) text: Harry and Ron duck into an alcove, take out the CRINKLED paper, which, we see now, is TORN from a library book.
100) 1) dialog: ‘Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the Basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it and only the crowing of the rooster can kill it.' (looking up) Ron! This is it! The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.
100) 4) dialog: Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly at least... (in a rush) Colin saw it through his camera. Justin -- Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost -- he couldn't die again... (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
100) 7) dialog: .-+. And Hermione... had the mirror! I bet you anything she was using it to look round corners, in case it came along.
100) 9) dialog: The water... there was water on the floor that night. She only saw the Basilisk's reflection... (scanning the page again) The crowing of the rooster is fatal to it! That's why Hagrid's roosters were killed! Spiders flee before it! It all fits!
100) 11) dialog: Hermione answered that too. Harry points. Scribbled, in Hermione's hand, is: "Pipes."
100) 13) dialog: Remember what Aragog said? About that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom. What if she never left.
101) 0) text: McGonagall stands before the desecrated wall, surrounded by the rest of the staff. Harry and Ron creep up the stairwell. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster. Into the Chamber itself. (as the teachers react) I'm afraid we shall have to send the students home. I'm afraid... this is the end of Hogwarts.
102) 0) text: Harry and a very upset Ron walk with desperate purpose.
102) 2) dialog: (pulling him away) C'mon. Let's go see Lockhart. He may be a brainless git, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him what we know...
102) 4) dialog: We'll find her, Ron. Ginny's going to be fine. (CONTINUED )
103) 0) text: Harry and Ron DASH inside.
103) 1) dialog: Professor, we've got some information for you -- Harry and Ron stop dead. Lockhart's office is stripped to the shelves. Two LARGE TRUNKS stand open.
103) 2) dialog: Are you going somewhere?
103) 11) dialog: You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
103) 13) dialog: You wrote them!
103) 15) dialog: You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what a load of other wizards have done!

105) 0) text: Harry and Ron slide wicked fast, in a hair-raising vertical plummet, catching glimpses of other, smaller pipes branching off in all directions, twisting and turning until the pipe levels off, dumps them onto the damp floor of a stone tunnel.
106) 0) text: Lockhart stares miserably at the muck dripping from his robes. Harry takes a TORCH from the wall, poises his wand.
106) 1) dialog: Lumos! The torch blooms with a BRIGHT ORANGE FLAME.
106) 2) dialog: Remember. Any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away. Harry leads the way down the tunnel. CRUNCH! They look down: a rat's skull. All around them, the ground is littered with TINY SKELETONS. Ron squints, sees something HUGE and CURVED lying ahead. When he speaks, his voice is hollow with dread. (CONTINUED )
106) 7) dialog: Maybe it's asleep. Ron draws his wand as they approach, squinting. Harry shines his light, revealing... a gigantic COIL of EMPTY SKIN.
106) 11) dialog: Ron? Are you okay? (CONTINUED )
106) 16) dialog: Wait here. I'll go on. I'1l go on and... find Ginny. If I'm not back in an hour... He leaves it there.
106) 18) dialog: See you in a bit. Harry glances at the snake skin at his feet, moves off. He steps carefully through the shadows until he reaches a TOWERING STONE WALL, carved with TWIN SERPENTS.
106) 19) dialog: (Parseltongue) Open. The serpents part and the GIANT WALL SLIDES OPEN. Harry removes his wand and ENTERS.
107) 0) text: A vast chamber stretches ahead. Along the path are rows of STONE SERPENTS. The serpents rest in pools of black water. Ahead is an enormous STATUE of SALAZAR SLYTHERIN. Several feet in front of the statue, Ginny Weasley lies motionless. As Harry dashes and takes her into his arms, her head lolls to one side, cheeks white as marble. A pale hand clutches TOM RIDDLE'S DIARY to her chest. Harry DROPS the torch, RACES to Ginny, places his wand on the floor and kneels beside her. (BOLD ITALICS INDICATE
107) 2) dialog: Ginny! Please don't be dead. Ginny! Wake up! Wake up! (CONTINUED )
107) 6) dialog: Tom... Tom Riddle? What d'you mean, she won't wake? She's not...

107) 23) dialog: But... Why?...
107) 25) dialog: (getting angry) And why did you want to meet me? (CONTINUED )
107) 29) dialog: Hagrid's my friend. And you framed him, didn't you?
107) 31) dialog: I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
107) 33) dialog: Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.
107) 35) dialog: Ginny stole the diary from my room? But why? (CONTINUED )
107) 40) dialog: Like what?
107) 42) dialog: Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.

107) 50) dialog: Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
107) 52) dialog: He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Suddenly, MUSIC... EERIE and UNEARTHLY... ECHOES deep within the chamber and a small, swift SHADOW ribbons over the rock. Flying from above is FAWKES, the Phoenix. The bird SWOOPS into the chamber, clutching a RAGGED BUNDLE in its golden talons.
107) 53) dialog: Fawkes. Fawkes flies toward Harry, drops the ragged bundle, which is the SORTING HAT, at his feet. Riddle picks it up.
107) 62) dialog: (to himself) Don't look. Don't look into its eyes. Harry RACES along the stone path, but the giant serpent is FASTER. Harry TRIPS. FALLS. The Basilisk RISES. Harry looks to the wall, sees the serpent about to strike Suddenly FAWKES SCREECHES, soaring toward the Basilisk and circling its blunt head, confusing it. The SNAKE SNAPS furiously, when... Fawkes drops like a knife, driving its talons deep into the serpent's glittering eyes. As Harry watches the angry play of shadows on the wall, the BASILISK ROARS, HISSING in pain. Fawkes wings away, its talons dripping with blood and Harry turns, LOOKS: the Basilisk's eyes are a blind, bloody mess.

109) 15) text: There is a RUSH OF WINGS and Fawkes circles down, lays his head onto Harry's arm.
109) 16) dialog: You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just... wasn't quick enough. Then Harry blinks, looks down. Thick pearly TEARS are trickling down Fawkes' face and onto his arm. Almost instantly, his wound... begins to heal itself. (CONTINUED )
109) 19) dialog: Of course. Dumbledore told me. Phoenix tears have healing powers. (looking up at Ginny) It's all right, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory...
110) 0) text: With Fawkes gliding gracefully ahead of them, Harry and Ginny make their way back. Up ahead, SHIFTING ROCK can be heard and a jagged fissure of LIGHT GLIMMERS. Ron's face appears.

110) 14) dialog: I think... I think he's telling me he can take us out of here.

112) 0) text: Harry and Ron, covered in muck and slime -- stand in Dumbledore's office. Fawkes perches on a pedestal behind Dumbledore, who sits at his desk, examining the charred diary. He looks up, regarding Harry and Ron gravely.

112) 11) dialog: Yes, sir. (CONTINUED )
112) 17) dialog: (grinning) Thank you, sir.
112) 20) dialog: It's just, you see, sir, I couldn't help noticing certain things. Certain similarities. Between Tom Riddle and me. (CONTINUED )
112) 24) dialog: Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?
112) 26) dialog: So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be a Slytherin.
112) 28) dialog: Only because I asked it to.
112) 30) dialog: 'Godric Gryffindor.’
112) 33) dialog: Dobby! This is your Master? The family you serve is the Malfoys! Dobby nods, chagrined. Lucius Malfoy brushes past Harry.
112) 43) dialog: Sir? I wonder if I could have that. Dumbledore looks up, follows Harry's eyes to the diary.
113) 0) text: As the elevator opens, Harry dashes out.
113) 1) dialog: Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours. Harry comes up running, thrusts the diary into Malfoy's hand.
113) 3) dialog: I think you do, sir. I think you slipped it into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day in Diagon Alley. Malfoy shoves the diary into Dobby's face, then leans close to Harry and, with a nasty grin, WHISPERS:
113) 14) dialog: Just promise me something.
113) 16) dialog: Never try to save my life again. Dobby grins then and -- CRACK! -- is gone.
114) 4) dialog: With loads of help from you. She turns to embrace Ron. They pause, an awkward moment between them and... shake hands instead.
114) 13) dialog: There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid. Just then... Dumbledore gets to his feet and... slowly... brings his hands together. The others join him. Soon, everyone is on their feet and the Hall ROARING. As the students surround Hagrid, he blinks, wipes at his eyes, and... CAMERA PULLS BACK, THROUGH the window, leaving the celebration. WE CONTINUE TO CRANE BACK... BACK... TO a WIDE SHOT OF HOGWARTS... glittering gloriously in the night. FADE TO BLACK.
