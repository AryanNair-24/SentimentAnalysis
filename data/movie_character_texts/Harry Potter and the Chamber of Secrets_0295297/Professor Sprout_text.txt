37) 7) dialog: Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Today, we will be re-potting Mandrakes. Now, who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake? Yes, Miss Granger.
37) 9) dialog: Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor. As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet. However, they will knock you out for several hours. That is why I have provided each of you with a pair of earmuffs. If you would then... Ron frowns. He's gotten a BRIGHT PINK FLUFFY pair. When the class is ready, Professor Sprout leads them to the GARDEN AREA. She grasps one of the TUFTY PLANTS before her... and pulls. Harry gasps. Instead of roots, a small, muddy, extremely ugly BABY pops out of the earth, leaves growing right out of its head. Neville's eyes ROLL BACK. He FAINTS. Professor Sprout plunges the BAWLING CREATURE deep into a POT, removes her earmuffs, and the others follow suit. Everyone save Neville, who lies stretched on the ground.
37) 10) dialog: Hm. Looks as though Mr. Longbottom neglected his muffs. (CONTINUED )
37) 14) dialog: Very well. We'll just leave him then. Come now. Four to a tray, plenty of pots to go round...
101) 9) dialog: Who is it the monster's taken, Minerva? PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Ginny Weasley. Ron's knees give way. As Harry catches him, the staff scatters, revealing what is written on the wall: Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.
