The aisles are lined with Priest-Technicians. Ahead is DEEP THOUGHT - a huge Buddha-esque computer. The procession peels away to both sides. Lunkwill and Fook dismount and approach.
33) 1) dialog: (deep and sonorous) What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the second greatest computer of all time have been called into existence?
33) 4) dialog: Second greatest. Yes.
33) 7) dialog: The Milliard Gargantubrain? A mere abacus, mention it not.
33) 11) dialog: The Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler could argue all four legs off an Arcturan Megadonkey, but only I could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards.
33) 13) dialog: I am the greatest computer you are able to design without my help. Which, one day, you are going to need.
33) 16) text: Long pause.    Deep Thought bleeps and bloops.
33) 17) dialog: The Answer...to what?

35) 3) dialog: An answer for you? Yes. I have.
35) 5) dialog: Yes. There really is one.

35) 20) dialog: (longest pause yet) Forty two.
35) 22) dialog: I checked it thoroughly. It would have been simpler, of course, to have known what the actual question was.
35) 24) dialog: Yes, but what actually is it?

35) 28) dialog: I can't. (long pause) But there is one who can. A computer that is to come after me, one that I will design. A computer to calculate the Ultimate Question, one of such infinite complexity that life itself will form part of its operational matrix.

75) 14) dialog: I designed another computer to perform that great task.
75) 16) dialog: Not here. Another world.
75) 18) dialog: It is another world. Or was.
75) 20) dialog: Ask your companion.
75) 22) dialog: Not him.
