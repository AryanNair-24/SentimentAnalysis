57) 15) dialog: Yes. Hi. We're here about getting a prisoner released?
57) 17) text: She holds out her hand. Arthur doesn't have a form. Annoyed, she points across the room to a wall that is nothing but shelves holding forms.

57) 23) text: Arthur sighs, frustrated. All three of them walk to the shelves holding the forms. Arthur turns to Zaphod.

63) 15) text: Arthur steadies himself, turns to Trillian who's still staring forward, angry. She unbuckles her seat-belt and moves away from the console. A planet appears on screen.     Zaphod and Ford lean forward.
63) 21) dialog: Look, you're right. You deserved to know and I should've told you. I don't blame you if you're angry.
63) 23) dialog: Right.   Anyway...I'm sorry.
63) 25) text: Hearing this news, Arthur, Trillian and Ford turn.
63) 36) dialog: Closed? How can a planet be closed?
64) 14) dialog: Look, why don't I just hit this thing?
64) 16) text: (84 cont) IN THE SKY-- The missiles turn and accelerate high into the sky. A second set of boosters kick in on the missiles as they soar back toward the H.O.G. --- much, much faster. (85 cont) ON THE BRIDGE-- They all stare at the approaching missiles. Arthur looks at the drive button. Screw it. He flips open the glass lid.
66) 7) text: They all look to Arthur who shrugs. Zaphod nods his approval. Ford counts on his fingers -- are they even? He waves it off, gives Arthur a little salute and moves on. Trillian looks to Arthur and musters a smile.
66) 8) dialog: I could really use a cup of tea.
69) 0) text: Arthur walks behind the others, his head down.
69) 2) text: Arthur looks up, registers surprise. THE ROCK FORMATION -- looks like Stonehenge - only newer. The rocks letters carved into them that read "DESIGN
69) 5) dialog: You mean -- the hippies were right?
69) 10) dialog: What?! Are you out of what's left of your mind? We can't step into that...that.
69) 12) dialog: Yes -- big biggie. What if that's the last door we ever step through? What if it rips us into tiny little atomic particle...thingies.
69) 15) dialog: Ford..?
69) 17) dialog: Go with the hunch of a narcissist with half a brain who's wearing a ridiculous thinking cap!? Are you insane?!
69) 19) dialog: I don't care what you think you think...
69) 22) text: And she takes off running for the door. Suicide? Bravery? They turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex. She YELPS as her body is bent in half, twisted like a rung mop, then sucked inside. Arthur is horrified, literally gasping for air.      Ford semi-impressed. Zaphod, unfazed.
69) 28) text: He runs after Ford, stops at the door, turns like he's about to board Air Force one, gives a salute, jumps in. Arthur finally gets his legs to move, steps up -- but hesitates at the threshold, paralyzed with fear, unable to take a step. Then -- FFSSSSH - the door seals shut.
69) 29) dialog: No.    No!     NOOO!!!
71) 0) text: Arthur sits with his back against the stone, staring across the field at the beautiful double sunset. He looks over and sees THE TWO MICE FROM THE SHIP -- scurrying toward one of the giant stone doors. They slip through a crack beneath the stone. A FLASH OF LIGHT bursts through the crack. Arthur barely reacts, so drained of emotion.
71) 1) dialog: Life is full of paradoxes, isn't it?
71) 3) dialog: Here I am, God knows how far from home...
71) 5) dialog: ...and this is where I see the most spectacular sunset I've ever laid eyes on. We only had the one sun at home. Planet called Earth.
71) 9) dialog: Oh no, it's beautiful.    Or at least, it was...
71) 11) dialog: Yes.   Great wide rolling blue oceans.
71) 13) text: Arthur looks up at Marvin.
71) 14) dialog: So this is how it will all end, then? Me, on a dead planet -- with a manically depressed robot.
71) 17) text: Arthur spins to see AN OLD, BEARDED MAN IN LONG ROBES.
71) 18) dialog: Aah!
71) 20) dialog: Who are you?
71) 22) text: Arthur continues to scramble away from the man.
71) 24) dialog: Late? What for?
71) 28) dialog: Dent. Arthur Dent.
71) 32) dialog: Trust a man who won't tell me his name?
71) 34) text: Arthur reacts with a furrowed brow.
71) 38) text: Arthur rises, cautiously moves over to Slarti's side.
71) 40) text: He puts his hand on a certain spot in the stone and presses. The stone dissolves revealing once again the jet engine swirling vortex. Slarti motions -- after you. Arthur takes a deep breath -- and steps in.
71) 41) dialog: Whaa!
73) 0) text: Arthur is hunched over a litter bin, barfing.
73) 2) dialog: I have found this whole day a bit disturbing.
73) 3) text: Arthur realizes he has his towel with him. He wipes his mouth with it, dabs his brow. Then he notices... ...THE ROOM -- which is like a car dealer's showroom only instead of cars there are models of various planets.
73) 5) text: No.   Arthur didn't know that.   He looks perplexed.
73) 7) dialog: ...and men.
73) 9) dialog: The best laid plans of mice and men.
73) 13) text: Arthur looks confused.     Slarti motions him to a door. 95      Arthur readies his towel at his mouth as Slarti h button. The door slides open and nothing happens. It's just a door that leads to a room where several TRANSPORT CARTS move past -- like a kids ride at Disneyland. They step into one. Slarti closes the little door. The cart MOVES through a curtain, out into DEEP SPACE. PULL BACK - till the cart is no more than a speck being pushed forward by the longest telescoping arm in history.
74) 2) text: ON ARTHUR -- who is positively blown away.
76) 2) dialog: Oh, you had that problem, too?
76) 4) dialog: What? You did that? I've been there!

78) 8) text: 101b      Arthur nods. The cart pushes through the clouds Ayers Rock. A GUY ON A LADDER is painting it it's familiar red color. Some of it is still primer grey.
78) 10) dialog: Mice?    Who cares about bloody mice?
78) 12) text: Arthur looks up.   Slartibartfast points down. 101c      ANOTHER MAN pushes a button causing mountains t up noisily.
78) 14) text: Arthur is working very hard to process all this. 101d      JUMP CUT. They move through a forest where a ma a lever making several MUSHROOMS pop up on the ground.
78) 19) dialog: They brought...I'm sorry, when you say "mice" do you mean the little white furry creatures with the cheese fixation?
78) 21) dialog: Ah. I see where you're confused.    You see -- we were experimenting on them.
78) 25) dialog: So -- you're trying to tell me that mice designed and built Deep Thought...and Deep Thought designed the Earth...which was a giant supercomputer...that you built...to calculate the Ultimate Question. Only, Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the program was completed?
78) 27) dialog: Actually, this explains a lot. All my life I've had this strange feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, something sinister ...
79) 4) dialog: And are you?
79) 6) text: l03      The platform slows to a stop.      Arthur steps stunned to see... HIS HOUSE. It's partially constructed. The chimney lies intact on the ground, waiting to be hoisted up. A row of hedges lies on it's side beside a trench. But it's his house alright.
79) 7) dialog: Is this...?
79) 8) text: Slartibartfast nods.      Arthur, in a daze, stumbles tow the house. 103a     INT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE/MARK 2 - CONTINUOUS Arthur enters his house. There is no furniture, no photographs or books or any evidence of his existence there. He feels the walls, the countertops. He's home?

79) 18) dialog: Hosts attack you --? And then you sit down for -- is that tea?
79) 19) text: Arthur has spotted a TEA POT on the table. He hurries to it, feels it. Warm. He pours a cup, takes a sip, Closes his eyes, enjoying it.
79) 20) dialog: Now that's a cup of tea.
79) 24) text: Arthur stares in shock...can't speak.
79) 26) dialog: Yes. Yes, I was. I just wasn't quite prepared for the full reality of it.
79) 30) dialog: In a moment, perhaps.   I can't seem to let go of this table.
79) 43) dialog: I'm sorry, when you say "the only living native" -- do you mean me? What about her?
79) 47) text: She goes back to eating.    Arthur is taking this all in.
79) 48) dialog: So -- mostly harmless and me.    That's it.
79) 54) text: Arthur goes to pull out the chair beside him.
79) 56) text: Arthur jumps. The others look up.      Benjy and Franky cover their outburst with a smile.
79) 58) text: Benjy makes a motion. The chair he pushed out before slides over behind Arthur's knees, making him sit.
79) 60) text: He slides the cup of tea over.     Arthur takes a sip.
79) 61) dialog: Mmmm.    This really is delicious.
79) 68) text: Ford and Zaphod eat. Benjy turns to Arthur. Smiles. No one notices, through the window, a row of Vogons cresting the hill.
79) 75) dialog: An Ultimate Question that sounds good... From a couple of mice...for a chat show.
79) 77) text: Franky tries to pour more tea. Arthur stops drinking, a little woozy. Did he hear them right?
79) 78) dialog: I'm sorry -- did you just say you need my brain?
79) 80) dialog: You can't have my brain. I'm using it.
79) 84) dialog: I would!
79) 86) text: Arthur tries to get up. Clamps spring up from the chair and wrap around his arms. A dome flips over from the back and slams down on his head. Arthur struggles.
79) 87) dialog: Ford!    Zaphod!   TRILLIAN!!
79) 90) dialog: What are they-- what's in the food?! WHAT WAS IN THAT TEA!?
79) 91) text: The platter the mice are standing on rises up, moves towa Arthur, ominous surgical instruments spring from it.
79) 93) text: The mice on the platter move ominously toward Arthur. Arthur, still attached to the chair, backs away. Scythes and rotating arms with circular saw blades shoot out -- ominous surgical equipment to remove his brain.
79) 94) dialog: Wait a minute, JUST WAIT A SODDING MINUTE!!
79) 95) text: The scythes and arms stop spinning. Arthur stumbles backwards and sits down in the chair. The others stop eating and listen.
79) 96) dialog: You want the question that goes with the answer "42" How about "What's six times seven?" Or "How many Vogons does it take to screw in a lightbulb?" Or here's one, "How many roads must a man walk down?"
79) 99) dialog: Fine. Take it. There's plenty more where that came from because my head is filled, with questions, and I can assure you mate, no answer to any of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness. Confusion? Yes. Indecision? Loads. But happiness...?
79) 104) text: 03a   CONTINUED: (6) Benjy steers the platter toward Arthur. He jerks his arms up. They break free of the shackles and hit the platter. The mice fly through the air and land on the table -- right beside the POV gun. They scramble to their feet.
79) 106) text: They try to lift the POV gun but it's way too heavy. Arthur, his butt still strapped in the chair, leaps over to the table and grabs the first thing he sees -- a leg of mutton. He raises it high. Benjy and Franky look up.
79) 108) text: Arthur brings the mutton down, squashing them flat. The others instantly snap out of their food induced haze, Zaphod suddenly clutches his gut.
79) 110) text: Arthur looks up and now he sees the Vogons marching down the hill toward the house. He leans over the table, bumping his teacup. IT SHATTERS TO THE GROUND.
79) 116) text: 106       The Police open fire. Zaphod and the others fle barrage of fire continues. Trillian drops the POV gun, goes back for it. Arthur stops her and pulls her behind the truck. Marvin catches a bullet in the back of his head - sparks fly and he is thrown forwards! Is he dead?
79) 125) dialog: (sarcastic) Brilliant plan. I'm certain it will work.
79) 131) text: 108      She and Arthur both run out toward the gun. ARTHUR                        TRILLIAN
79) 134) text: The Police stop their retreat, raise their guns, move forward. Ford skids to a stop and runs back toward Arthur and Trillian, both clinging to the gun, running back toward the truck. GUNFIRE ERUPTS. A and T TRIP. The POV gun goes flying and lands in... MARVIN'S ARMS.
79) 142) text: They turn their weapons on themselves and... ANGLE ON FORD, ZAPHOD, ARTHUR AND TRILLIAN -- turning their heads as we hear the weapons fire. They look up. 108a     All the Vogon Police lie motionless on the groun including Kwaltz. Questular is the last man standing. He marches toward them, patches of clump baldness on his head. He drops to his knees.
79) 150) text: They share a laugh.      Arthur approaches Slartibartfast
79) 151) dialog: Thank you.
79) 155) text: Arthur thinks about it...looks around...slowly nods...
79) 156) dialog: Yes.   Me.
79) 159) dialog: Yes, You name it. I'll go.
