30) 20) dialog: Apparently you can't be President with a whole brain.
30) 22) dialog: Yes -- I think. And I think I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the Government screening tests -- or by me. So, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I know it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the answer is-- (thinking) --I don't know. Obviously.

36) 11) dialog: Oh. Well -- partly the curiosity, partly a sense of adventure, but mostly I think it's for the fame and the money.
36) 14) dialog: Yes, Arman.
36) 16) dialog: Whatever. Presidential fame is temporary, I find the Question, that's permanent. It sticks. Plus everyone thinks you're deep. Win-win.

36) 22) dialog: There. To find Deep Thought.    On Magrathea.
36) 24) dialog: No, it isn't. It's real, cousin. And this is the only ship in the universe that can get you there.

44) 20) text: Humma lays his palms on the table and lifts himself as if to stand - but there is nothing of him below the table line except for thirty, one inch metal legs, attached to the base of his torso. He glides towards Zaphod, the little legs extending to reach the floor as he reaches the end of the table.
44) 26) text: His head jerks up.   Zaphod stops it, paints on a smile.
44) 27) dialog: That's really not the point.

49) 19) text: Arthur sees the Vogon ships getting away. Desperate, he shoves_Zaphod out of_the_driver's seat. Zaphod hits the floor, considers protesting, lies down on the floor to sleep instead -- with a contented smile. Arthur sits. He looks very out of place in a seat normally reserved for the likes of Han Solo. He scans the console. Ford sits in the seat beside him.
