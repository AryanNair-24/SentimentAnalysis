His partner JAKE BERKOWITZ, slightly rumpled, slightly older, dozes next to him. Castle extracts a package from a paper sack and begins to unwrap it.

Hi little girls are in the back seat, screaming, pounding at the window of a car. Castle reaches back and punches the glass, shattering the window. He reaches into the car for the girls. His hands filling the frame. Castle pulls the girls to his chest only they are no longer in the burning wreck but in a bright, sun dappled, grassy field.
