The bartender, “SWEET” WILLIAM CARR, is in his mid thirti He would be handsome in the right scenario, but Vegas has taken its toll on him. His hair is a mess, his expression weary, and arms are patterned with tattoos of questionabl quality.
27) 2) dialog: Yes, drunkard? Lamb scans the liquor selection and lands on a bright, cartoonish looking bottle.
27) 4) dialog: Peach schnapps. Neat? Lamb blinks. WILLIAM (CONT’D) Would you like ice?
27) 7) dialog: (deadpan) “I Dice Las Vegas.”
27) 9) dialog: It makes perfect sense if you’ve come to here chop people up into little pieces. Lamb doesn’t flinch.
27) 12) dialog: Let’s see, it’s almost nine...ah, yes. Looks like my dear friend Loray is on deck. He gestures to a YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN leaving a crowded blackjack table. Another DEALER is in the process subbing in at the table.
27) 13) dialog: Here we go. An EMCEE’s voice booms over the microphone.
27) 15) dialog: She hates the word “diva.” People at the bar turn toward Loray as she moves to the center of the room, holding a cordless mic. She has a commanding presence, even in her silly Imperial Palace uniform. The bar patrons begin to murmur and speculate as what Loray might sing.
27) 23) dialog: She’s not supposed to sing this. She’s been warned. Indeed, we see the PIT BOSS frowning at his defiant emplo
27) 25) dialog: People here don’t want beautiful. They want--
27) 32) dialog: Was that your first, ah, schnapp? Lamb’s voice is a faint croak.
27) 34) dialog: Here. This is called a “water back.” (winking) All the experienced drinkers order these. He gives Lamb a glass of water. She downs it gratefully. Lamb takes a PRESCRIPTION PILL BOTTLE out of her purse, shaking a few capsules into her hand. She puts the bottle down for a moment to politely applaud Loray. As Lamb turns away, William zeroes in on the label, readi it: VICODIN (HYDROCODONE). His eyes are filled with longi Desire. Pain. Lamb turns back and William acts casual. Loray is headed straight for the bar. She squeezes in next to Lamb. 38.
27) 36) dialog: You were great, honey. In what may have been your final performance.
27) 38) dialog: (dry) No. Why would anyone want to hear a rousing Motown crowd-pleaser?
27) 41) dialog: Loray, this is my new friend Lamb Loray looks at Lamb then back at William. She rolls her e as if to say: you're hitting on this?
27) 45) dialog: Lamb is...what, celebrating her birthday? Where are your friends? (MORE )
27) 47) dialog: Surely there must be a gaggle of drunk college girls looking for you.
27) 49) dialog: A murder. Like crows.
27) 51) dialog: Too obvious, honey.
27) 64) dialog: Don’t chase it into its cave. It bites. Lamb realizes she’s left her purse hanging on the chair. Naively, she continues on her way, calling back to Willia

29) 10) dialog: OMF-Jesus.
29) 13) dialog: I’m off at eleven. (to Loray) You have my number. The new number, the 702... Loray raises an eyebrow at him, surprised.
33) 18) dialog: I changed my mind, called Patti. (to Lamb) I thought Loray was going to look after you. She’s got you drinking “Snowy Piss?”
33) 20) dialog: I could have told you that back at the hotel. I was there for the “schnapp-ocalypse.”
33) 22) dialog: What are you doing, Lor? Show-and- tell?
33) 24) dialog: Is that true? Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 54. Loray is at the stage of tipsiness in which everything is hilarious. Paraphrasing Ariel:
33) 26) dialog: I believe the sheltered bit. She’s definitely confused about certain customs. Do you know how much money she tipped me for one drink?
33) 28) dialog: No...
33) 32) dialog: Do you want to sit down?
33) 34) dialog: There’s an upstairs bar. It’s sort of not open on weeknights, but they know me here. They don’t care. Maybe we'll just sit down for a few minutes. Lamb considers this cautiously.
33) 35) dialog: Are you scared of me?
33) 37) dialog: I'd understand if you were.
33) 39) dialog: (take aback) Well, those guys are faking it. They're using a look to sell religion.
33) 41) dialog: You're mean, Lamb. I think I’11 just let you suffer.
33) 43) dialog: You can stand here throbbing in pain. I don’t care. Hey, there are some nice seats in the latrine if Hepatitis B is on your to-do list. Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 56.
34) 0) text: William gently helps Lamb up the steep bar stairs. She’s having trouble.
34) 2) dialog: Me neither, but I don’t have a cool, tragic excuse. I’ve got a hundred bucks that says you can dance better than I can. As William helps her, we see him discreetly RETURNING THE she left him, tucking it back into her purse. She doesn’t notice.
34) 4) dialog: There’s nothing wrong with that. All dancing is just a prelude to bouncing anyway, right? He winks.
35) 0) text: William unhooks a rope blocking the entrance. The upstair bar is a quiet, empty room with an old-school big screen a Christmas tree, and plenty of seating. Lamb and William down at a high-top table. Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 57. There’s a row of PAPER CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS tacked to the with EMPLOYEES’ names on them.
35) 3) dialog: I don’t drink.
35) 5) dialog: Not even a little. (then) I don’t drink anymore. I had some problems with, ah, substances, and the sale thereof. (beat) Did some time. In prison.
35) 7) dialog: What is it?
35) 9) dialog: Oh. Yeah, you always see these on the Strip. Kind of grim, I guess.
35) 11) dialog: Ah, this isn’t even a real girl. These places use fake, misleading pictures. (then) I hear.
35) 13) dialog: She does in-call as well. That means you can also come to her...
35) 15) dialog: You can’t just go around saving people. Trying to do that here is like that arcade game, you know, with the little mallet? You put one devil down, another one’s just gonna pop up.
35) 18) dialog: What is it? Lamb is panicking. 59.
35) 20) dialog: No worries. You probably have, like, unlimited refills right?
35) 22) dialog: No. Loray wouldn’t do that.
35) 24) dialog: Oh. No. She’s so good, Lamb. She’s a deeply good person. She loves the Beach Boys. (serious) I’ve worked with her for four years; she’s like my sister. She’s my pit wife. Please don’t even think for a second it was Loray. You have enough for now, right? There’s a bunch of 24-hour pharmacies right around here. I'll drive you.

37) 0) text: William takes a remote from behind the bar and turns on t big TV. He flips through the channels and finds... The classic 1960s special, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer Lamb reacts like a delighted child.
37) 2) dialog: Of course. Total classic. Even I’ve seen this and my childhood was a blur of beatings and evictions.
37) 7) dialog: What’s wrong with the doll?
37) 9) dialog: Seriously, though, what’s her defect? I can see the train has square wheels. And the elephant has polka-dots. But that little doll looks completely normal. What’s she doing with those broken toys? We see the rag doll. She does look perfectly normal. (Thi one thing that has never made sense about the “Misfit Toy scene.)
37) 11) dialog: You think it’s under her dress or something? Lamb is uncomfortable. Her voice is strained.
37) 13) dialog: Or...maybe she’s perfect.
37) 15) dialog: Maybe she’s just in the wrong place. Loray emerges from the stairwell, interrupting them. She glances at the TV, drunk and dismissive.
37) 17) dialog: You don’t know what this is?
37) 19) dialog: She needs to rest.
37) 22) dialog: Okay.

38) 13) dialog: You're wearin’ anti-Amurrican clothing. He flicks at the fringe on Lamb's scarf.
38) 14) dialog: What are you going to do next?
38) 23) dialog: That’s perfectly understandable. I thought it was real myself.
38) 25) dialog: I did. I’ve looked for it. Checked every marquee.
38) 29) dialog: After hours is when the employees come out to play.
38) 34) dialog: I’ll take you, Lamb. Loray, come on. I don’t want you driving.

39) 6) dialog: You know that prescription pain killers are extremely addictive, right?
39) 8) dialog: No. I know. I know. I’m just saying that this is, sadly, my area of expertise. I happen to know that certain controlled substances, such as this one, can cause a dependency. Even when people don’t set out to abuse them. Lamb is crumpling the bag irritably.
39) 10) dialog: Lamb. She sees how serious he is.
39) 11) dialog: It’s not something a person can always help. Even if they’re the most well-meaning, most responsible, nicest, loveliest person in the world and they’re named after a baby farm animal. Lamb looks away.
39) 12) dialog: I know people who’ve been so hooked on that stuff that they’d do anything to get it. Gross things. Really bad things, not fake-fun-bad like what you’re doing here. 68.

42) 8) dialog: Don’t be like this.
42) 10) dialog: She is pretty.
42) 13) dialog: (defensive) I don’t know, I felt like it tonight. My sponsor says I can’t stay in forever and I thought it was time.

42) 17) dialog: I know this is hard to believe, coming from me. But I would never take advantage of her.
42) 19) dialog: Loray, I would never. Not her. I wouldn’t take that from her.
42) 21) dialog: They're all there. I didn’t take a single one. I mean, yes, I took them out of her purse about four minutes after I met her. But I didn’t take them. (MORE )
42) 23) dialog: I’ve thought about them nonstop since they’ve come into my possession, but I haven’t taken one. There’s a moment of relieved silence for Loray. Then:
42) 25) dialog: I don’t know. We'll give them back to her and she’1l hate me and I’1l1 have a pathetic story for my next NA meeting.
42) 27) dialog: I know. But I can’t let her think you stole it.

43) 10) dialog: You're not a mess. It’s not a big deal. You just need to take it easy. Chill at the hotel.
43) 14) dialog: I think you’ve had enough fun for the night. We need to patch you up. Lamb is clutching her bleeding elbow.

45) 5) dialog: I don’t think that’s one of the recommended steps in wound care. 81.

48) 16) dialog: What’s with the dishes? Lamb sighs.
48) 18) dialog: It’s fine. I was just wondering. You know, hotel comforters are supposed to be the worst. Lamb eyes the patterned BEDSPREAD warily.
48) 20) dialog: Yeah, they don’t wash them and they’re allegedly covered in se... (correcting himself) Cigar...ette ash.
48) 22) dialog: Sure. Lamb pulls the comforter off the bed and onto the floor. There’s something awkward about discussing the bed.
