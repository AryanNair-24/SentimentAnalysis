We see her arms, covered with FL TONED COMPRESSION GARMENTS-- they’re like Ace bandages crossed with fingerless gloves. Lamb sits up, slowly and with effort. She’s a pretty youn woman. But her shoulders and neck are marred by PINK SCAR TISSUE. The scars could be covered with the right clothin but right now, every flaw is exposed. She winces in pain. Every day begins with pain.

She wiggles her toes and reaches for a prescription PILL BOTT close at hand. Lamb dry-swallows four Vicodin pills in rapid succession- she’s a pro at this. We see that there’s a cup of HOT CHOCOLATE waiting for he the bed table. A CANDY CANE and some MINI-MARSHMALLOWS dissolve in the cocoa. Lamb moves the cup, revealing that napkin/coaster bears a handwritten message: “You R Still Pretty!!! XOxO Mom." Lamb wrinkles her nose at the cocoa.

As they watch the video, Melanie provides rapid-fire commentary:

But really, you were hoping to hear gory details about the crash. Like how I could smell myself burning, but I couldn’t feel it. On Melanie: her face falls. This wasn’t what they practic But Lamb remains calm, smiling, even serene.
5) 5) dialog: Isn't that funny? I was in the parking lot of a Kroger, on fire, and as I laid there, all I could think about was my shoes. That they looked strange. “I don’t remember wearing clogs today. Oh. I didn’t. They’re regular shoes, but they’re melting. And, come to think of it, so am I.” The crowd begins to murmur. Lamb continues brightly.
5) 6) dialog: Well, the accident was bad. But the surgeries-- those were even worse. Did you know they can take skin from your butt and put it on your back? And where does that leave your butt?

I’m here to share my new wisdom with you. Everyone, there is no God. Pastor Rick appears at her side, but she slaps him away.
5) 8) dialog: Don’t touch me. My skin grafts are very fragile. I could bleed all over our nice new alter carpeting and then you’d have to take up another collection! (to congregation) Another collection. You already tithe most of your income to this place. How’s that working out for you? Do the skate park and the putting green make you feel more righteous?
5) 10) dialog: I’m not done yet, Mom. Almost. Okay, so I don’t believe in God. Here’s what I do believe: I believe in science. I believe in the doctors who were there when I woke up. I believe in opiates and morphine, which work whether you have faith in them or not. I’m willing to believe that the universe was created in an explosion, and that fish-creatures crawled out of the mud and evolved into human beings. And, in our next presidential election... (pause) I may vote for Obama. That does it. Chaos breaks out in the auditorium. Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 14.

Feedback squawks as Melanie grabs the mic and interrupts in a shaky voice.

39) 13) dialog: Look, I know you guys think what I’m doing here is so funny, but you have no idea how serious it is to me. Being here tonight goes against every belief that’s been instilled in me. It’s like bending a bone backwards. I’m trying to smile and have fun and let go, but I feel like I’m going to snap.
39) 15) dialog: Well, when does it get fun? I just want to have fun. How is this something people enjoy? Bars aren't fun. That bar smelled like the flu. And that dumb slot machine wasn’t fun. It took my money and just said “bar.” Great, I just paid ten dollars for a machine to tell me where I am. It’s not fun, William. I just want to do something that’s fun for me.

43) 13) dialog: My gosh, I never thought about it that way. You’re so wise. On Loray: OWNED.
43) 15) dialog: Enough fun my skinless ass! It’s easy for you to say “enough” and to “take it easy”, because you already got to do everything you wanted. You already got to screw up and disappoint your whole family. On William: sadly, this is true.
43) 16) dialog: You've got those lines on your face and that silver in your hair because you lived. Now it’s my turn.
43) 18) dialog: (through tears) Yes I do. 76.
43) 20) dialog: The flute.
43) 25) dialog: Don’t bother. They’1l just wrap it in some gauze and parade me around in front of the med students. I hate when people treat me like I’m some kind of curiosity. Loray glances at William. Guilty. 77.

44) 8) dialog: I’ve had sex. Of course. (explaining) I had sexual relations with Pastor Rick, or just “Rick” as he asked me to call him during that fateful youth retreat. I’d been attracted to him for a while and I succumbed to baser urges. Looking back, I can see that it was an abuse of power on his part, but what’s done is done... Loray’s like what the fuck?
44) 9) dialog: Don’t tell me you’re surprised. You think fundamentalist Christians don’t have sex? (MORE )
44) 11) dialog: Ha, everyone has sex. It’s the one thing they haven’t figured out how to control.
44) 13) dialog: Even the church leaders do it. Sometimes they get caught with other men, even! Don’t you read the news? She hops into the cab, shrugging cheerfully despite her injury. Loray prevents her from shutting the car door.
44) 15) dialog: You don’t care.
44) 17) dialog: I don’t know.
44) 21) dialog: Hey, you know how you said no one ever came looking for you? That nobody cares where you are? 80.
44) 23) dialog: Well, I followed you into the bathroom. And then I followed you downtown and, well, I gotta say... more people should come looking for you. They’d find some amazing things.

It’s the t of night when drunk and drugged people completely lose th minds. It’s so loud that William can’t speak to Lamb, and vice versa.

48) 17) dialog: I brought my own dishes from home. I don’t know why people find this so strange! (exasperated) I had to let go of a lot of prejudices and fears to come to Las Vegas, so I don’t know why it’s such a big deal that I’d want to have my own tableware. I should have something familiar. Hotels are notoriously dirty.
48) 19) dialog: Really?
48) 21) dialog: Should I take it off?
48) 23) dialog: You didn’t have to come all the way to my room. I could have found my way up from the lobby.
48) 25) dialog: Well, that’s a bit like hypnotizing chickens. (off his blank look) Easy. William sits down on the DESK CHAIR.

48) 38) dialog: I mean, I understand. I’m not without my vices. I’m totally addicted to-- well, you know those vanilla sandwich cookies, with the creme filling? I love them. If you had a big bag of those cookies, boy, when you weren’t looking? I'd eat a couple. Maybe I’d eat 10. My flesh is weak. She’s anything but weak, and William knows that.
48) 40) dialog: No, I’1l admit it. I love vanilla sandwich cookies. (quietly, almost whispering) And also Vicodin.

52) 7) dialog: I was in a plane that went down. The boy who was courting me-- my boyfriend, I guess you would call him-- he was a pilot in the Air Force. It was our first date without a chaperone, and he decided to take me up. He was very experienced, but... Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 93.

52) 19) dialog: No. I know it seems strange to suffer so much pain for just the tiniest flash of beauty-- but it’s fair. I don’t know how, but it adds up. The world is tipped in favor of goodness. That’s how I know someone is there. I can’t see him, or her, or it, but I know. I can feel His hand on the scale, making things even out. Giving our lives worth. Ryder makes a face that (somewhat) approximates a SMILE.
