27) 19) dialog: There's a world where I can go and tell my secrets to. In my room...
27) 28) dialog: Now it's dark and I'm alone but I won't be afraid... Lamb watches Loray sing and is affected. There’s somethin brave about Loray’s sincerity and conviction in this room full of bawdy revelers. 37. William, despite his toughness, is touched by the fact th Lamb is touched.
27) 31) dialog: In my room... Lamb takes her first sip of the drink and makes a horrifi face. A river of peach nastiness escapes down her chin. William hands her a cocktail napkin as tepid applause fil the casino.
27) 35) dialog: Well, the good news is, I’m off for the night. We are officially on LST: Loray Standard Time.
27) 37) dialog: Yup, my ass is grass. Management says they want me to sing “Respect.” I mean, can you believe that?
27) 40) dialog: Brian Wilson. That’s my jam. I mean, I prefer his more obscure compositions, but...
27) 42) dialog: I hope that’s Pedialyte, ‘cause your new friend is 10.
27) 44) dialog: 21 double-A. You're a fetus. She accepts a COCKTAIL that William has automatically pou for her; we can see this is a standard end-of-shift ritua
27) 48) dialog: A gaggle? No, I think a pride.
27) 50) dialog: No, no, no, a flock! Get it? A flock of--
27) 53) dialog: Uh-oh.
27) 55) dialog: Let me guess. You came here-- hm, best case scenario, you came here to be... (deciding) A showgirl.
27) 57) dialog: Come on. You’re sitting here alone on a Monday night in December. Cute little face, calling yourself LAAAM-buh.
27) 59) dialog: Weave down to your butt...
27) 61) dialog: Bleach blonde...
27) 63) dialog: Hey, look. I’m half-finish, too. (to William) Top me off. She chuckles and heads toward the bathroom. William reach for Loray’s glass to refill it. Before he can stop Lamb, she’s jumped off the stool and i following Loray. Bad idea.
28) 0) text: A TOILET flushes. Loray emerges from the stall and sees L standing by the sinks, her eyes narrow and indignant.
28) 1) dialog: Whoa. You look like an angry...baby...cobra. (beat) Look, I’m sorry I gave you shit back there. I have to amuse myself somehow.
28) 3) dialog: No one cares what you are. Lamb is overly invested in proving her innocence. 41.
28) 5) dialog: Yeah? I have a skin condition too. It’s called “black.” She laughs at Lamb’s angst.
28) 6) dialog: (mocking) “People would stare.” Yeah. Try being me at the cell phone store.
28) 8) dialog: Shh. This is the best part. She lowers her hands into the wind tunnel, then withdraws them slowly and indulgently.
28) 9) dialog: Love the Airblade. She shakes her head, satisfied. As she heads for the door Lamb interrupts once more.
28) 12) dialog: Wow. Am I in the first five minutes of pornography?
28) 14) dialog: That is quite the pitch, Lamb. I have heard some crazy stories from some broken folks here in the People’s Republic of Bad Choices, but that one? That one takes the whole hash brownie. (suspicious) Are you looking for money or something? Are you a junkie? I bet those gloves are covering some tracks... Lamb whips off her cardigan wordlessly. We see not Lamb, Loray, as she looks at Lamb’s scars.
28) 15) dialog: Oh.
28) 17) dialog: You're telling the truth.
28) 19) dialog: And you're all by yourself, looking for trouble. You want to be a criminal?
29) 0) text: Loray is walking quickly across the casino floor. She’s changed into STREET CLOTHES and carries a backpack. Lamb trots after her eagerly.
29) 2) dialog: I don’t know yet. I know if I leave you by yourself, you’re going to wind up somewhere horrible, like the trunk of a car or Circus Circus. I feel an strange sense of responsibility toward you. You're just a little deep-fried pickle from Ohio...
29) 4) dialog: From Montana, population four, and you came here to commit sins. What did you have in mind, specifically?
29) 6) dialog: Sex? (looking Lamb over) I’m sure you’ll have no problem finding someone to wreck that. Lamb is uncomfortable with this suggestion.
29) 9) dialog: I’m taking Lamb downtown.
29) 12) dialog: William’s in the program. He only goes out for donuts and his “Higher Power.”
29) 14) dialog: I got your number all right, Pedo-Bear. Have a nice night.
29) 16) dialog: Come on, Lamb..what’s your last name?
29) 18) dialog: Jewish? Lamb gasps, delighted by this “shocking” suggestion.
29) 20) dialog: Uh, sorry? Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 45.
29) 23) dialog: If you want to see Las Vegas, we have to go to Las Vegas.
29) 25) dialog: No, we’re not. We’re in Paradise. Lamb is perplexed.
29) 26) dialog: They may call this the “Vegas Strip,” but it’s actually located in a census-designated area called Paradise. Paradise, Nevada. You can look it up. Most tourists don’t know. They all say they’re headed to Vegas, but technically, they're going to Paradise. Lamb stares longingly out at the lights of the Strip.
29) 28) dialog: No you don’t, Lamb. Paradise is processed cheese. Do you want roller coasters and a fake Eiffel Tower and a bunch of tourists clapping for a frigging computerized fountain? Yay, robot! Yay, robot fountain! No. (MORE )
29) 30) dialog: You want real Las Vegas, where the locals go. None of this trifling theme park trash. Actually, the other stuff sounded pretty good to Lamb.
29) 32) dialog: What is Creation Land?
29) 35) dialog: “Trop Light.” How long have you been here? You’re sure you’re not a hooker?
29) 37) dialog: Sorry.
29) 39) dialog: Glitter Gulch. This is the real life, yes indeed. 47. Lamb rolls down the window, then cautiously rolls it back halfway.
29) 41) dialog: Sure, when I’m not at school or at the Palace.
29) 43) dialog: Yeah, UNLV. Is that so shocking? You don’t have any black friends, do you? Everyone says they have the one black friend, but you don’t even know that guy.
29) 45) dialog: If he comes back next year, tell him Loray says hi. Lamb changes the subject.
29) 47) dialog: Filn.
29) 49) dialog: Really? Nobody made shorts?
30) 0) text: A line of LOCAL HIPSTERS snakes around outside Loray’s favorite bar, The Sceptre. Loray and Lamb are quickly wav to the front of the line.
31) 1) dialog: All right, let’s get this out of the way. Pull. Reveal Lamb in the crowded bar, the kind of place that ha Christmas lights even when it isn’t Christmas. She eagerl yanks the lever on a campy vintage SLOT MACHINE. The machine’s display reveals a CHERRY, a BELL and “BAR.”
31) 2) dialog: There. You gambled. You played your game of chance. And now you see why it’s stupid. Let’s move. She tries to urge Lamb ahead, but Lamb is perplexed.
31) 4) dialog: Yes, Lamb, you lost. Ultimately, everyone loses. If you lit that dollar on fire, at least you'd have kindling. I have no respect for gamblers. They make their way toward the bar.
31) 6) dialog: That's right, for a living. Not for my own personal edification. Charlie! Hey, Charlie! CHARLIE, a cute, tattooed FEMALE BARTENDER, looks up from taps, where she’s busily filling pints. She grins.
31) 8) dialog: I’m thinking we're going to need some shots. Line ‘em up.
31) 10) dialog: Lamb’s from Montana. She was home- schooled. The hipsters shout over the jukebox, admiring Lamb.
31) 15) dialog: Lamb has never danced. She’s not on Facebook. She’s never even seen an R-rated movie.
31) 20) dialog: Watch her try to drink this. Loray pushes a SWEET TART toward Lamb. Everyone watches L as if she’s an exotic zoo animal. Lamb takes a tentative of the vile pink concoction. Her face crumples.
33) 5) dialog: Look. You’re on a dance floor and hell hasn’t swallowed you up. Lamb looks around at the DANCING IDIOTS in skinny jeans. 52.
33) 7) dialog: Ha. All right.
33) 9) dialog: We do, huh?
33) 11) dialog: Drink your beer. She hands Lamb a beer. Lamb looks at the CAN. The beer is called “Snowy Piste”; the can depicts a man skiing down a mountain.
33) 13) dialog: It’s ironically delicious. (then) Oh, shit. Look who came out for the first time in MONTHS. She shouts toward the offending entrant. Lamb peeks up ov the bobbing heads.
33) 14) dialog: Sweet William. William nods at them as he passes the doorman and maneuve himself through the crowd. Lamb sees him and lights up. S waves. Loray seems sincerely shocked-- perhaps even a bit hurt-- by William’s arrival.
33) 15) dialog: He never comes out. Never-ever-ever- ever-ever.... Lamb interrupts the drunken broken record.
33) 17) dialog: William, I thought you were going to pick up a second shift tonight.
33) 23) dialog: Hey, she wanted to come here. William, she’s from, like, a religious commune. Okay? Like, Basement. Religious. Slave. She's never done any of this. It’s like she’s a weird-ass Disney princess that’s been locked in a tower her whole life. (singing The Little Mermaid) “She wants to be where the people are. She wants to see, wants to see them dancing...”
33) 25) dialog: (still singing) “She was-- what’s the word-- BURNED? When’s it her tuuurn?”
33) 27) dialog: She's country, huh? Did she put pennies on the bar?
33) 29) dialog: Well, don’t complain, because I didn’t get a tip! She did not tip me, and I sang. From the heart! I was an unexpected treat. Before William can ask any more questions, Lamb returns f the bar with a soft drink.
33) 31) dialog: What largesse. Lamb leans against the wall. Though she’s trying to stay energetic, her body language betrays that she’s SORE and TIRED. She touches her arm. William notices.
36) 0) text: Loray is grinding with a HEAVILY BEARDED GUY. She takes a swig of beer and tries unsuccessfully to make out with hi through his mass of facial hair.
36) 1) dialog: I can’t find your mouth.
37) 16) dialog: What is this? Gumby? Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 62. William and Lamb groan at Loray’s flippancy toward such a beloved show.
37) 18) dialog: You guys need to come downstairs immediately. Some people are line dancing as a joke. William fakes jumping out of his seat. Then:
37) 21) dialog: Hey William, you know that girl who always does the splits? She did it again. I'm like, bitch, we get it, you can put your whole vagina on the floor.
37) 23) dialog: I’m gonna fight her.
37) 25) dialog: You take a girl upstairs and you put on cartoons? You’re a mess.
38) 0) text: Lamb, William and Loray walk down Fremont Street, eating DOGS from a busy food truck. Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 63.
38) 1) dialog: So is dirty street meat against your religion? Lamb is enjoying her hot dog immensely.
38) 7) dialog: What was that all about?
38) 15) dialog: She needs to get turned out.
38) 17) dialog: What? Don’t tell me “sins of the flesh” aren’t part of the agenda. It should be right there in your little Sanrio day planner: GET LAID. What else is there? At least you have to do something dirty.
38) 19) dialog: What's Goddess? Lamb is already blushing before she even describes it.
38) 21) dialog: Lamb, Showgirls is not real. Okay? It is not a documentary about Las Vegas. It is fiction. It came out of a horny Dutch man’s imagination. Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 65.
38) 24) dialog: (dying) William, you did not.
38) 27) dialog: Back to Paradise, baby!
38) 30) dialog: We know everyone, and everyone loves us. We can go wherever we want and our money is no good.
38) 33) dialog: (sadly) Possibly.
38) 35) dialog: It’s fine. I’1l get a cab. (accusingly) You take her to the drug store, William. I’1l catch you later. She begins to walk away from them rather suddenly.
38) 37) dialog: Yeah, yeah, I need some breathing room. It’s like shawarma and liquor are having a UFC fight in my stomach. I’1ll see you guys on the Strip.
41) 0) text: Lamb, William and Loray wait in line for the roller coast Loray’s arms are crossed and she’s pissed off. Lamb, howe looks THRILLED.
41) 4) dialog: No.
41) 6) dialog: What the hell is Type D?
41) 8) dialog: Maybe it’s just late on a Monday and I’m tired of being your magical negro.
41) 11) dialog: The “magical negro” is, uh, a narrative convention in which a black person uses their special black wisdom to help a dumb white person. We learned all about it in film school. Ghost, Green Mile, Bagger Vance. All magical negroes.
41) 13) dialog: Yes I am! Lamb, don’t I say a lot of things that make you go, “Wow, Loray just told me! She’s so insightful.”
41) 15) dialog: That's extremely racist. 70.
41) 18) dialog: Shut up.
41) 20) dialog: No, that’s just what Will Smith looks like.
42) 0) text: William, Lamb and Loray stand behind the automated airgat as the COASTER TRAIN arrives in the station.
42) 5) dialog: Aw. Baby’s first assless chaps. Don’t worry. You don’t have to talk to him. Git. Lamb boldly jogs to the front of the coaster train. The airgates open. Loray is stuck riding with William. She lo away as they climb into the train and pull down the restraints.
42) 7) dialog: You know why. The roller coaster lurches out of the station.
42) 9) dialog: It’s bad enough that you stole pain relief from a girl who’s held together with bandages and chewing gum. But it’s even worse that you're up her ass all night. The whole “white knight” routine you do. Helping her up that dark stairwell. Bringing her here-- you know we’re never caught dead doing this tacky shit! And you’re flirting with her. Making her feel pretty. It’s cruel.
42) 11) dialog: Obviously, yes, but she’s pretty like the Playboy Mansion. Looks like a dream, but you don’t want to pull up the carpet. The coaster ascends the lift hill.
42) 12) dialog: Why are you here? 72.
42) 14) dialog: Time. I bet it’s time. You’re here because you found a blonde virgin with a purse full of dope.
42) 16) dialog: “Trouble” is up there next to the naked cowboy, and you’re acting like you'd rather get in it.
42) 18) dialog: Ha. Yes, it is hard to believe coming from you. The man they call “William the Conqueror.” “Fill’em Will’em.” “Bill the Butcher”...
42) 20) dialog: Didn't you already take something from her? A moment of silence. Loray looks off toward the side of t lift hill. They’re almost 200 feet above the Strip. William reaches for Loray’s hand. She’s confused for a moment. When William lets go, Loray opens her palm. He’s surreptitiously handed her FOURTEEN VICODIN PILLS.
42) 24) dialog: What do you expect me to do with these? You know I prefer crack.
42) 26) dialog: No. I like how she looks at you. She looks at you like you’re a good person and not a total jagoff.
42) 28) dialog: I don’t care. Let’s protect her from something. She’s gotta hang on to some of that sweetness. As the train crests the lift hill, Loray tosses the handf of tiny white pills over the side.
42) 30) dialog: Tonight’s Clark County forecast calls for scattered flurries. William watches the pills disappear.
42) 32) dialog: Open your damn mouths! The train PLUNGES into the roller coaster’s spaghetti-lik mass of steel track. 74.
43) 3) dialog: You're bleeding.
43) 12) dialog: From a scientific standpoint, we’re all rotting alive.
43) 19) dialog: You're lucky you had a nice life. I know you resent all the Jesus stuff and not being allowed to wear shorts and the fact that they made you practice the recorder every day.
43) 21) dialog: But there are worse things than being protected. Having someone care where you go and what happens to you. We can see that Loray has wished for this very thing. Wil glances at her protectively.
43) 22) dialog: People in your family are probably looking for you right now. Nobody's looked for me in years. The last time someone Googled me, there was no Google. They had to Alta Vista that shit. Lamb looks up at Loray, still holding her elbow.
43) 23) dialog: Also, I’m not the one bleeding on the street right now. You've lived, all right? All right, plane crash? You lived, you died, and now you’re living again. You’re a lot harder than most of these clowns. She gestures to the LATE NIGHT REVELERS on the street.
43) 29) dialog: Let William take you back. William looks at Loray, surprised. Loray nods.
43) 30) dialog: He’s the best guy when you need taking care of. Once I got food poisoning at work and he guarded the door to the women’s bathroom for six hours. William smiles at this awful-yet-touching memory.
43) 31) dialog: He’s not perfect. I’1l tell you no lies. But he’1ll get you home in one piece. Or whatever pieces you've got left. Lamb giggles through the pain.
43) 32) dialog: You can trust him. With that, she extends her blessing. William’s gratitude evident. Loray’s RESPECT means a lot to him. Lamb considers it.
44) 0) text: William flags a CAB. Loray waits with Lamb on the sidewal taxi appears and pulls up to the curb. William gives Loray a friendly hug and a peck.
44) 2) dialog: See you in the pit. William gestures for Lamb to enter the cab. She hesitates
44) 5) dialog: It was something meeting you, too. (then) Hey, look, I’m sorry I teased you about all that sex stuff. I could tell it upset you. It was pretty insensitive of me.
44) 7) dialog: Uh, what? Lamb is shockingly casual.
44) 12) dialog: I just thought...
44) 14) dialog: Wait. What’s going to happen to you?
44) 16) dialog: Let’s pretend I do.
44) 18) dialog: Well, I know you think Las Vegas was kind of a bust. But this is all make-believe. It’s fake, like Goddess. Lamb smiles.
44) 19) dialog: If you still want to be a regular American, like you said? Lamb nods.
44) 20) dialog: I think you need to go see America. Lamb takes in this advice. Then:
44) 22) dialog: Yeah?
62) 2) dialog: Another postcard, huh? The girl gets around.
62) 6) dialog: We've worked here so long we’re on the National Registry of Historic Suckers.
62) 8) dialog: With my lucrative B.A. in Complaining About Cinema. (then) So where is she now? Chicago?
62) 10) dialog: I see you trying to not smile. Look at that. You’re like a seventh- grade girl. William turns away, refilling a CUSTOMER’S pint glass.
62) 12) dialog: Yeah, right! I see you cheesing back there. Careful, you might pull a muscle. The EMCEE has taken the stage. Loray finishes her drink.
62) 13) dialog: I’m up. 107.
62) 16) dialog: I think you’re going to like this one. It swings. She nods to the BAND. We hear the tinkling opening notes “Wouldn’t it Be Nice?” by the Beach Boys. Loray begins to sing in her sweet, clear voice.
62) 17) dialog: Wouldn't it be nice if we were older... The CROWD responds favorably, applauding as Loray bounces around the casino with the mic. This is the musical “happ medium” she’s been looking for. William watches her with admiration and affection.
63) 0) text: Lamb sits in the window seat of an airborne JET. She look more confident and assured than we’ve ever seen her. No longer hiding in shapeless garments, she wears the clo a “normal” 22-year-old woman would wear. Skinny jeans, a hoodie, and a pair of boots. But there’s a small CROSS ar her neck and she still carries herself with Lamb-like dignity. Lamb gazes out the window as the sun melts into the cloud It’s as beautiful as any religious illustration. But it’s REAL. We hear Loray’s voice singing joyfully: Wouldn't it be nice... We don’t know where Lamb’s going. But we know she’s going be all right. THE END. 108.
