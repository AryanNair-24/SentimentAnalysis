15) 21) dialog: I guess it runs in the family. He smiles.
15) 23) dialog: Are you nervous?
15) 26) dialog: That tickles... Seriously. She starts to laugh and struggle. He holds it tighter and bites up her leg. She grabs his hands to stop him.

ISABEL’S BEDROOM, INDIA - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 24 A slight breeze blows, gently swaying her curtains. Isabel lies in bed awake. Jaques sleeps next to her. A SCREAM from the other room. Isabel sits bolt upright.
18) 3) dialog: (into phone) What’s their response to the truncated retention period? She listens.
18) 4) dialog: That’s not going to work. We can give on the deferred compensation, but the retention period is non-negotiable. She listens. Wider. We see the beauty of the path. Bill lays out the terms he’ll go back with. Theresa slows as she sees something up ahead. A massive tree that has fallen in last nights storm, split at the base of its trunk.
18) 5) dialog: OK, I’m on my walk. I’m going to call you back from the car. She hangs up and approaches the tree which blocks the path. AT THE TREE: Theresa is dwarfed by it. She examines it, walking down the length until she gets to where it split. It's a violent but beautiful sight; Splintered wood, roots with moss still attached pointing up to the sky, tree sap hanging on the points of the razor sharp breaks in the wood. She touches it in fascination. A little sap on her fingers. She lets them stick together. Then, just over to the side, she spots something else. A birds nest on the ground. Theresa goes over to it and bends close. She clears away some leaves to see the carefully made nest has shards of broken blue eggs in it. She touches one gently, then looks up in the sky. A bird circles above.
30) 0) text: A large shed like building with a little courtyard. We can see the house in the background. The courtyard and the studio are filled with sculptures and tools. Some are large. Some made of wood, some stone. There is also a kiln in the corner with blocks of clay and pots in various stages of being glazed. Oscar stains a wood piece, that stands about as tall as him. We can’t quite see it in it’s entirety. His phone rings: “Theresa”. INT. OUTSIDE HORIZON CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME 4l Theresa has stepped out of a meeting to call Oscar.
31) 1) dialog: I think I forgot to tell the caterer no sesame or nuts.

36) 4) dialog: (into the phone) Christine... (getting irritated) Christine! Here is the important point. The valuation potentially changes if this leaks into next quarter. If getting it done quickly means conceding a few of these points, then do it. Theresa sees Isabel.
36) 5) dialog: I need to go.
36) 7) dialog: (to her team) I’m not sure why we hired someone to guide us through the process, who we now need to guide through the process.
36) 9) dialog: Okay. But can we think about renegotiating her fee because we’re doing most of the work here. Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BE? 23. Tanya nods. Theresa stands and exits the conference.

37) 22) dialog: Jonathan. Theresa stands and picks up a framed photo of Grace.
37) 23) dialog: Grace is young. But she says she’s in love. I could fight her on this and tell her she’s too young and have her hate me - I've tried that. Or I could give her a beautiful wedding. Theresa hands Isabel the framed picture. Isabel looks down at it. A beautiful picture of Grace stares back at her.
37) 24) dialog: Do you have kids? Isabel shakes her head, ‘no’.
37) 25) dialog: Partner?
37) 27) dialog: I understand. I really wanted a family. I think a lot of women believe it’1l just happen on its own. Isabel isn’t sure if this is a criticism.
37) 28) dialog: But personally, I think if you want it, you have to make it happen. I have 2 little boys too. I worked hard for them. Theresa takes the picture back and replaces it on the shelf. Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BE? 26. Isabel tries to refocus the conversation. She reaches into her bag and pulls out another folder.
37) 30) dialog: What you’re doing is very impressive. It’s important work. Isabel gives a tense smile.
37) 31) dialog: But there are a lot of good, deserving organizations out there. I need some more time to think. Isabel is surprised and annoyed.
37) 33) dialog: I have a big weekend ahead of me and I feel like I need the time. Leave the folder. Monday we’ll have lunch and I’1l let you know what I can do. Isabel is fuming, but holds it in. 51 52 53 Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BE? 27.
37) 34) dialog: In the meantime, come to the wedding. We can get to know each other better.
37) 36) dialog: Staying the weekend won’t kill you. It’s a big party. You won’t be uncomfortable, I promise. Isabel is stuck. The door opens and her assistant comes in comes in.
37) 37) dialog: Gwen, get Isabel an invitation to the wedding.
37) 40) dialog: Not you. Me. There are a lot of hoops to jump through when you're selling your company. See you tomorrow. Theresa smiles at her. The doctor is shown in. Isabel walks out. We go with her.
41) 0) text: A lot of action on the lawn. Trucks in the driveway, people setting up for the wedding. Theresa's car wends down the long driveway toward the big house. It stops and Theresa gets out. She heads across the lawn toward Oscar, who is speaking to the wedding planner, MELINDA. She looks slightly frantic. Before Theresa can get to them, the twins, Otto and Theo ambush her. Her face lights up as they run into her arms. She bends to scoop them up and they almost all topple over. She laughs.
41) 1) dialog: Hello my little cookies... She covers them in kisses. They laugh and resist - and love it.
41) 2) dialog: Chocolate chip... and peanut butter...
41) 4) dialog: Oh that’s right, someone is allergic! Sugar then... She pretends to eat their cheeks. They point to the sky where a a hi-tech drone with a camera mounted soars above them.

42) 5) dialog: Where’s Gracie? Oscar looks toward the epic tent. Another kiss.
43) 0) text: Lush and beautiful. Tables are being set, flowers placed. Theresa sees Grace counting chairs, excitedly and anxiously. Theresa takes Grace in for a moment then approaches her.

43) 4) dialog: No. I wish what you wish. Grace smiles and hugs her mom again.
43) 6) dialog: I don’t see what would be so wrong with just living together for a year... Grace has heard this before.
43) 8) dialog: And, he’s not as good looking as you. She's clearly used to this.

She takes off her shoes. AT HER BUREAU, she removes her earrings and other jewelry. Places it on a tray. Next to the tray we see the bird nest with the three little cracked eggs in it, that she brought back from her walk. Theresa opens a drawer where she keeps a pill box with pills/vitamins divided into daily doses. She grabs “Friday”, puts the pills in her mouth, and swallows them without water. ON THE CLOSET WINDOW, we hang on an empty frame. Theresa walks up to the window. Expression unreadable. THERESA’S VIEW OUTSIDE Pink Rev. (05/28/18) BE? 32. She looks out at the big oak tree. Branches outstretched like arms. She breathes in. Breathes out. Breathes in. Breathes out. Then out the window, what looks like a bird, flies over the tree. She leans closer to discover it’s the drone. It flies high above the tree, swooping this way and that. We hear the children’s giggles from below. Theresa closes her eyes and we see:

85) 8) dialog: So, I’ve talked to our lawyers about establishing a fund. Isabel tries to process this.
