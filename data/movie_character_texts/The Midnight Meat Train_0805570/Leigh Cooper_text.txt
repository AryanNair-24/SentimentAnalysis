14) 8) dialog: Did we just miss a stop?
14) 13) dialog: (quietly) Randle? The guys ignore her. 21.
14) 16) dialog: Randle? RANDLE! Randle and Troy turn as Leigh screams, but Mahogany is up them, raising his massive arms. THUD! The steel hammer strikes Troy in the temple, knocki him to the floor. Mahogany spins gracefully, catching Randle in the gut wit a gigantic meat hook. The train lurches, knocking Leigh to the ground. Leigh screams as he lifts the meat hook up, hooking into Randle's rib cage. CLOSE on Randle's feet as Mahogany lifts him off the floo above Troy's body. The steel hammer finishes Randle with a sickening crunch. He falls to the ground next to his friend.
14) 17) dialog: (whimpering) Why are you doing this? Mahogany pulls the meat hook out of Randle and turns, walking towards Leigh. Leigh scrambles away, knocking into his leather bag and falling to the floor. Butcher tools spill across the car. Leigh screams, trying to wrap her hand around a long CARVING KNIFE. Mahogany comes up behind her. And just as she is about to get a grip on the blade-- Mahogany grabs her ankles, pulling her backwards like a squealing calf. 22 A glint of metal above her head, the arc of the 22. steel hammer. THUD! She drops to the ground, legs twitching, silent. The lights flicker as the train clatters down the track.
