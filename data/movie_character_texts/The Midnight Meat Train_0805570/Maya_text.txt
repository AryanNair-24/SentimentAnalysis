His body slides out the door, falling from the train. Leon gets to his feet. He grabs Maya and shakes her back to full consciousness, then he holds them both safe by using a strap to support them.

Leon looks on the car for the Driver. He’s gone. The train is plunged in darkness - there’s no sign of him anywhere. Maya cringes and grabs hold of Leon’s hand. He reaches down and sees a pile of human bones. There are skulls and remains all around. The leavings of several centuries of feeding. Leon kneels down and surveys the chaos of bones, dry skul and still-fleshy heads of those who surrendered here. Som are so life-like it seems they might speak of the horror. Leon approaches a pile of skulls which seem to form a circle. Suddenly, one skull comes to life. It’s a still-living head, and it moves out from the circle of skulls and dead men. 114 81.

She gives him the once-over, then turns back to the televisio She reaches behind and yanks the plug. The set blinks off Leon goes to an old desk and leans over something we cann see at first. As he leans over it, we recognize the BLACK VALISE. He takes out several corkscrew tools and inspects them. THE LID OF THE VALISE SLOWLY CLOSES ON ITS OWN. Leon steps up to the hallway door, he picks up a BLACK LEATHER BAG from the floor. We hear a quiet metallic clatter. Engraved on the leather is the name “Mahogany.” Leon pauses and cocks his head. Hodge now stands right behind Leon, and she takes a leath datebook out of her coat and presents it to him. It is th same datebook which Hodge took from Maya. Leon holds the book a minute, glances at its contents, th stuffs it inside his coat. He opens the outer door. A uniformed cop has his back to us in the doorway, but he moves to let Leon pass. And now the cop shuts the door.
