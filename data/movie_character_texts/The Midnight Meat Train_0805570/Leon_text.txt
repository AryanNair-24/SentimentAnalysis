The walls and all fixture of the car have a brushed metallic sheen, and light from the outside tunnels flashes the metal as the car rushes along. Overhead straps hang from the ceiling, and they move slightly in rhythm with the train. A flash of light reveals more of the straps: They’re not straps but sharp metal hooks, like hooks used to hang sides of beef. The train moves faster, and the hooks dance, slightly clangin Now the light changes again, and the hooks are hand strap just swinging, waving. INT.

He finds a bench and sits down. A shrug. What did he think he’d find at this hour? Even bad guys go to bed. He leans back, like he might doze off. Shuts his eyes. Then, very quietly at first, footsteps echo on a staircas They are coming up from the Pershing Square subway statio Camera up, Leon jumps up from the bench and ducks behind it. He lines up the subway entrance in his viewfinder. LEON’S POV: A large dark shape fills the frame, walking. POV: The camera lifts slightly, and we see an immense hea CLICK. Leon takes a shot. CLICK. He takes another. The man he catches is MAHOGANY. A big man in his 50’s wit a crisp white shirt, dark brown suit, and hair oiled back He holds a leather bag, and, eyes straight ahead, he walk alone along the sidewalk on the other side of the street. Leon is fascinated. He takes a few more shots until Mahogany crosses a street a half block away from Leon. Leon lets him walk another twenty feet before he follows. He keeps close to buildings, but Mahogany doesn’t look behind him. Mahogany moves very fast for a large man. In a few quick strides, Mahogany rounds a corner. Leon breaks into a run, stops at the corner, and then turns.

17) 1) dialog: Sorry Mister, I just wanted a picture of you. Sometimes I don’t even think about it. Leon notices Mahogany’s wrist, a TWISTED METAL BRACELET against his starched sleeves. A small moon and star. Then Leon’s eyes shift down to the bag on the ground. CLO on the engraved “Mahogany.” The bag is closed. Noting Leon’s look, Mahogany picks his leather bag up. We hear the clang of something metallic and heavy inside. Mahogany hefts the bag, and the clang is more pronounced. Leon looks up, reacting to the gesture, still nervous. He stares at the heavy bag and sees Mahogany’s large hand -- Is that a small spot of red on his wrist? Leon freezes. Leon takes a step back, suddenly afraid. Mahogany cracks a thin smile and shakes his head no. His gaze locked on Leon. A chill runs down Leon's spine. Mahogany turns and continues down the street. He reaches the stone staircase of a residential hotel and goes up. Leon stands there, as if he stepped in front of a bus. INT. LEON’S APARTMENT - DAY - LATER 26 Leon stands at his sink, fingering through a stack of prints. He pulls out all his shots of Loretta Dryer and looks them over. He sees something he hadn’t noticed: In his shot of the Homeless Man, there is a large man in a brown suit, seen from the back, carrying a leather satche Leon squints, then pulls out his last shot of the Hip Gir getting on the train. He sees the big hand holding the door. On the wrist, a thin line. A metal bracelet. Is that a moon, or just a smudge? No, just a smudge. Leon lowers the print, wondering about the connection. EXT. MAHOGANY’S RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - EVENING 27 Mahogany exits the building and walks down the street. Leon peeks out of a doorway. He waits a beat, then follow 28 29 30 31 32 27.

Intestines fall into a stainless steel cart. CLICK Blood is squeegeed through metal grates. CLICK! A bone sa sends a cloud of white dust in the air. The dust settles. Suddenly, at the rear, Mahogany emerges from a locker roo putting on blue coveralls. Leon jumps back a few feet. Mahogany, butcher’s apron on, reaches for a side of beef the size of a man. Without stopping, he wraps his arms around it in a gesture like a hug and lifts it like a pillow. He easily tosses it five feet onto a cutting rack Leon reacts, intimidated.

27) 0) text: A dark shape hangs from the ceiling of an otherwise empty subway car. It trembles like a slender cocoon, shaking an writhing. But it is a body with its hands tied up. We've seen this car before: Metal hooks hang from the ceiling. A large man seen only from the back approaches the hangin body, and he holds the body still with one gloved hand. The man now runs his hand over the body, which jerks in response. Suddenly, we see the man’s other hand. Also gloved, it holds a long, glistening blade. The man thrust it in the body. Now we see the victim clearly for the first time -- It’s Leon. His face filled with terror, he reacts in agony to the blow. INT. LEON’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 43 Leon's eyes are open. He knows it was a nightmare, but he is deeply disturbed. Anxious, he just stares at the ceiling. He looks over at Maya, in bed next to him. Sound asleep.

Now he readies his camera, spying through columns on the Workers opposit His first sight of the full floor stuns him. The production line is running full tilt. A powerful stench rises from the line.

Leon swings up his camera and looks through the lens: POV: A man in a white coat, clearly the boss, looks acros the floor at his crew, but he doesn’t say a word. Another worker, a butcher, gives the boss a look, but he turns away. Leon slowly pans his camera, snapping photos: blood and guts, bones and hooks, the machines grinding out processe meat. THROUGH LENS: We track across the length of the productio line, seeing the conveyor chains which pull the lines along. Now we tilt down slightly, and a LARGE FACE fills the frame. MAHOGANY stares directly at us, eyes looking into the len Leon reacts. Mahogany has caught him. But maybe not. Mahogany turns away, walking out of frame. Leon follows him with the lens. POV: Mahogany stands at a tool bench and looks for something. He picks up a large knife and examines it. He twists it. Now Mahogany looks directly at us once more. He must see us. Leon jumps back, hyperventilating. Mahogany moves quickly across the floor, carrying the knife he got at the bench. Leon makes a quick break, running back along the inside wall. He backtracks to the window he came through, and he sees Two men in butcher coats blocking his path. Leon hides behind a column, unable to see the floor. He leans around the column. Mahogany stands just ten feet away. Leon moves back behind the column. He checks the window. The two men still block his path to the window. He waits. He leans out again and sees -- Mahogany is walking toward him. Leon sees a side hallway. 48 49 37.

Mahogany moves down the side, using the hook to move the beef aside. He crouches to check under the meat. No one there. Leon desperately hangs onto the chain, his arms shaking. Drip, drip, drip. Something hits Leon's forehead. He look up: a piece of meat swings above him. Leon almost drops. Mahogany grunts, pushing through the meat. Leon almost slips on the chain. Mahogany's shoes are closer. Then the shoes walk away. We hear steps, then none. Leon aches to let go of the chain, but he waits. No sound He takes a breath....and drops to the floor. No one there He turns -- -- And Mahogany is standing right before him. A few feet. The two men stare eye to eye for just a second.

He sees the outline of Mahogany in the dimness just outsi the open doors. Through Leon’s hallucinatory haze he sees that the car is stopped, but he can see no sign of a platform or station. Blackness engulfs everything. Then-- Leon screams in terror and pain as he is swung violently around by something unseen. Blood flows down into Leon’s eyes - further blurring his vision. He can’t see what’s attacking him. Something is carving away at his chest. Tearing at the skin. Through the train doors, Leon can see Mahogany. It’s not Mahogany who is carving at Leon’s chest. It’s a non-human appendage with what appears to be barnacle-like growths. Mahogany takes a step toward the interior, but he sees Le and turns away. His expression shows nothing. He just vanishes from sight. Leon’s world spins and he passes out again, coughing bloo and straining against the unseen terror.

Another look back at the Workers to see what he can use to fit in. Each has a belt with one or two tools. 92 93 69.

They watch as the corpses in the car begin to bobble obscenely - being readied for their destination. With numerous uneven thuds, the corpses drop down, and Le and Maya hear them being dragged across the dark subway car. Then a shuffling noise can be heard outside the car, this time its the sound of the bodies being pulled along. The shuffling recedes in quiet waves, and finally all is silent. Leon looks on the car for the Driver. He’s gone. The train is plunged in darkness - there’s no sign of him anywhere. Maya cringes and grabs hold of Leon’s hand. He reaches down and sees a pile of human bones. There are skulls and remains all around. The leavings of several centuries of feeding. Leon kneels down and surveys the chaos of bones, dry skul and still-fleshy heads of those who surrendered here. Som are so life-like it seems they might speak of the horror.

Not wanting to end-up like the "meat" on the train, Leon scrambles backwards thru the bones that litter the cavern floor then, grabbing hold of the cleaver still embedded i his shoulder, he yanks it free. Blood from the newly open wound instantly soaks his shirt. Leon starts to raise the cleaver in defense but the clawe hand of a "Father" grabs his wrist from behind. Leon turn There are more "Fathers" behind him. He's surrounded. The cleaver falls to the ground as the "Fathers" lift Leo to his feet. He's too weak to even think about fighting them off. He's held up, arms outstretched arms like a scarecrow's. Another clawed hand grabs Leon's chin and forces his face to turn sharply left. Leon has no choice but watch as several "Fathers" pass, carrying Mahogany's now naked bod They drop Mahogany to the floor and step back. Just beyond Mahogany's body is absolute darkness save the random highlights cast by the torches of the "Fathers". And then these highlights begin to move. What appeared initially to be just a cavern wall is actually the skin o a being so massive that it fills the cavern floor-to- ceiling and continues away from Leon and the "Fathers" to an unknowable depth. The bits of skin visible are darkish in color, smooth in texture although thin enough to revea the massive muscles that ripple beneath and consistently wet. This is the "Grandfather".
73) 5) dialog: My God. From the darkness, one of the "Grandfather's" arms emerge and, grabbing hold of Mahogany's head, suddenly yanks his body up. For a split second, the "Grandfather's" mouth is visible as it opens wide and then, as Mahogany disappears inside, it's swallowed again by darkness. The only evidence Mahogany ever existed is the crunching of his bones. Leon freaks. Struggles with all he has left to escape but the "Fathers" force him to his knees. And from the darkness, two of the "Grandfather's" arms emerge. Between them is Maya. She is hanging a couple feet off the ground naked and porcelain white. 84. Whether she is alive is unclear at this moment but what i clear is that Leon has never seen something so beautiful. She hangs in the darkness like an angel.

And now the man in the neat suit stands before the set, watching the report with Hodge. It’s Leon. But virtually a spitting image for Mahogany. He shows no interest in the news and faces Hodge. She gives him the once-over, then turns back to the televisio She reaches behind and yanks the plug. The set blinks off Leon goes to an old desk and leans over something we cann see at first. As he leans over it, we recognize the BLACK VALISE. He takes out several corkscrew tools and inspects them. THE LID OF THE VALISE SLOWLY CLOSES ON ITS OWN.

The young man leans back in his seat, sleeping, unaware.
