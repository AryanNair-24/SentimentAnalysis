He finds a bench and sits down. A shrug. What did he think he’d find at this hour? Even bad guys go to bed. He leans back, like he might doze off. Shuts his eyes. Then, very quietly at first, footsteps echo on a staircas They are coming up from the Pershing Square subway statio Camera up, Leon jumps up from the bench and ducks behind it. He lines up the subway entrance in his viewfinder. LEON’S POV: A large dark shape fills the frame, walking. POV: The camera lifts slightly, and we see an immense hea CLICK. Leon takes a shot. CLICK. He takes another. The man he catches is MAHOGANY. A big man in his 50’s wit a crisp white shirt, dark brown suit, and hair oiled back He holds a leather bag, and, eyes straight ahead, he walk alone along the sidewalk on the other side of the street. Leon is fascinated. He takes a few more shots until Mahogany crosses a street a half block away from Leon. Leon lets him walk another twenty feet before he follows. He keeps close to buildings, but Mahogany doesn’t look behind him. Mahogany moves very fast for a large man. In a few quick strides, Mahogany rounds a corner. Leon breaks into a run, stops at the corner, and then turns.

Intestines fall into a stainless steel cart. CLICK Blood is squeegeed through metal grates. CLICK! A bone sa sends a cloud of white dust in the air. The dust settles. Suddenly, at the rear, Mahogany emerges from a locker roo putting on blue coveralls. Leon jumps back a few feet. Mahogany, butcher’s apron on, reaches for a side of beef the size of a man. Without stopping, he wraps his arms around it in a gesture like a hug and lifts it like a pillow. He easily tosses it five feet onto a cutting rack Leon reacts, intimidated.

The cologne goes back in a cabinet, its place is marked with a thin outlin Mahogany nudges the bottle to perfection with his finger. A muscular shoulder comes into the frame. We reveal more of the shoulder, until we see a gauze bandage. He curls the bandage back, and we see a growth, like a boil. It is flat but large, composed of barnacle-like bubbles. They are moist, glistening. Are they moving? He examines them. Now he pulls open a drawer, and we see an assortment of scalpels, neatly arrayed by size in a cutlery rack. He takes one in his hand and pushes it into the edge of the growth, cutting underneath. A line of blood appears, but he cuts further. He peels the growth off as he shaves it. He places the shaving into a green glass bottle, then screws it tightly shut. He places it in another drawer, and we see a collection of green bottles, each filled. Then he is wracked by a cough, deep enough to cause him t lean over. He reaches into the cabinet and takes out a dark pill bottle. He opens it, takes one, straightens up.

Now he readies his camera, spying through columns on the Workers opposit His first sight of the full floor stuns him. The production line is running full tilt. A powerful stench rises from the line. Not a rotting stench. Rather, a steam of blood drops. It almost overwhelms Leon, who feels the blood like a mis 36. Leon swings up his camera and looks through the lens: POV: A man in a white coat, clearly the boss, looks acros the floor at his crew, but he doesn’t say a word. Another worker, a butcher, gives the boss a look, but he turns away. Leon slowly pans his camera, snapping photos: blood and guts, bones and hooks, the machines grinding out processe meat. THROUGH LENS: We track across the length of the productio line, seeing the conveyor chains which pull the lines along. Now we tilt down slightly, and a LARGE FACE fills the frame. MAHOGANY stares directly at us, eyes looking into the len Leon reacts. Mahogany has caught him. But maybe not. Mahogany turns away, walking out of frame. Leon follows him with the lens. POV: Mahogany stands at a tool bench and looks for something. He picks up a large knife and examines it. He twists it. Now Mahogany looks directly at us once more. He must see us. Leon jumps back, hyperventilating. Mahogany moves quickly across the floor, carrying the knife he got at the bench. Leon makes a quick break, running back along the inside wall. He backtracks to the window he came through, and he sees Two men in butcher coats blocking his path. Leon hides behind a column, unable to see the floor. He leans around the column. Mahogany stands just ten feet away. Leon moves back behind the column. He checks the window. The two men still block his path to the window. He waits. He leans out again and sees -- Mahogany is walking toward him. Leon sees a side hallway. 48 49 37.

Mahogany approaches. Leon looks for an escape, but there is only the one door. Leon pushes into the meat. A sound behind. The door opens. Leon grabs onto a chain and pulls himself a few feet up. Mahogany moves down the side, using the hook to move the beef aside. He crouches to check under the meat. No one there. Leon desperately hangs onto the chain, his arms shaking. Drip, drip, drip. Something hits Leon's forehead. He look up: a piece of meat swings above him. Leon almost drops. Mahogany grunts, pushing through the meat. Leon almost slips on the chain. Mahogany's shoes are closer. Then the shoes walk away. We hear steps, then none. Leon aches to let go of the chain, but he waits. No sound He takes a breath....and drops to the floor. No one there He turns -- -- And Mahogany is standing right before him. A few feet. The two men stare eye to eye for just a second. Then -- Leon bolts, running as fast as he can to the door, slippi once on the floor but lunging ahead. He’s out the door. Leon hits the plant floor -- but Mahogany is right behind 50 51 52 38. Leon sees the overhear production track across the aisle, and he throws himself at the closest hook. He cuts his hand, but the hook jerks him a few feet ahead of Mahogany Leon jumps down and turns.

He sees the outline of Mahogany in the dimness just outsi the open doors. Through Leon’s hallucinatory haze he sees that the car is stopped, but he can see no sign of a platform or station. Blackness engulfs everything. Then-- Leon screams in terror and pain as he is swung violently around by something unseen. Blood flows down into Leon’s eyes - further blurring his vision. He can’t see what’s attacking him. Something is carving away at his chest. Tearing at the skin. Through the train doors, Leon can see Mahogany. It’s not Mahogany who is carving at Leon’s chest. It’s a non-human appendage with what appears to be barnacle-like growths. Mahogany takes a step toward the interior, but he sees Le and turns away. His expression shows nothing. He just vanishes from sight. Leon’s world spins and he passes out again, coughing bloo and straining against the unseen terror.

Maya shudders and turns....but it’s a young blond man, no more than twenty, smiling a bright harmless smile. Maya walks through the turnstile. INT. MAIN PACKING FLOOR - NIGHT —- CONTINUOUS 91 The line is running full tilt: carcasses swing down the track, sides of beef split, ground meat squeezed out. Leon sees a laundry bag with dirty butcher smocks by the door. He grabs one from the top and throws it on. He strides into the plant, looking around as he walks. Th workers ignore him. A BIG GUY, broad shoulders up ahead. Leon walks right up to him. He turns the Big Guy around. He’s not Mahogany. The Big Guy scowls but turns away. Leon reaches a work sink. It’s full of BLOODY TOOLS being washed clean by a constant flow of water. He glances behind. Nobody’s watching him. Next to the sink is an apron/work belt hanging from a hoo on the wall. Another look back at the Workers to see what he can use to fit in. Each has a belt with one or two tools. 92 93 69. Picking and choosing, Leon takes a short knife and a pointed tool that looks like an awl. He puts the belt on and tries wearing the tools. The belt droops, so he drops the awl and keeps only the knife and belt. He sees an old pair of work goggles. He fixes the strap to fit him, and he puts them on. Then Leon grabs a bloody cleaver and hefts it. Keeps it. Suddenly, somebody shoves him out of the way. He’s ready defend himself, but it’s just another butcher, putting hi tools in the sink. The other butcher wonders if he knows him. Leon just stares back, offering a little nod. The butcher nods back. Leon backs away, armed. Leon takes a meat hook from the sink and hangs it on his belt next to his knife. Then he lifts the bloody meat cleaver. INT. MAIN PACKING FLOOR - NIGHT —- CONTINUOUS 92 Leon walks with determination, knife and meat hook clanki on his belt, cleaver in his hand. Just ahead, he sees the door to the subway. No one is around.

The third is an oddball with round glasses. He wears a three-piece brown suit which seems too tight. He carries well-worn sample case. Maya gives him a hard look, wondering. He doesn’t look like Leon’s photos of Mahogany, but he looks too muscular to be a salesman. Maybe the suit is just tight. He gazes at her, then looks away. Maya keeps an eye on him. Suddenly, there is a shrill sound of brakes. The train slows. Maya jerks in her seat as the train comes to a hard stop. None of the other riders moves. Then the two punks jump u and leave the car in one startling motion. The door shuts 94 95 96 70. Maya looks at the man in the brown suit. He ignores her. The train starts moving.

Now the man in the suit stands up. He walks right to her. Maya leans back and grabs her purse. She digs her hand in The man stops between Maya and the door. He grabs the roo hand rail. Now he stares straight at her. Is it a smile? The brakes hiss. Slowly, the subway car stops. Doors open. The man lets go of the hand rail and steps out of the car The doors close behind him.

He gun hits the floor and disappears beneath the seats. Calmly, Mahogany opens his bag of tools and removes a butchering knife. Maya looks up as Mahogany moves toward her.

Leon ducks, grabbing Mahogany’s hand. Mahogany rips his hand free and stabs Leon in the arm. He is just grazed, and Leon counters by throw himself at Mahogany. Mahogany loses his balance and falls back. He puts his knife out to anchor himself, and his blade hits a hanging carcass. The carcass groans. It’s Jurgis, the blade embedded in him. Mahogany yanks the knife out and rips half of Jurgis’s chest. A sickened Leon grabs Mahogany and pulls him down on the car floor, close to the open car door. The rock face race past.

They watch as the corpses in the car begin to bobble obscenely - being readied for their destination. With numerous uneven thuds, the corpses drop down, and Le and Maya hear them being dragged across the dark subway car. Then a shuffling noise can be heard outside the car, this time its the sound of the bodies being pulled along. The shuffling recedes in quiet waves, and finally all is silent. Leon looks on the car for the Driver. He’s gone. The train is plunged in darkness - there’s no sign of him anywhere. Maya cringes and grabs hold of Leon’s hand. He reaches down and sees a pile of human bones. There are skulls and remains all around. The leavings of several centuries of feeding. Leon kneels down and surveys the chaos of bones, dry skul and still-fleshy heads of those who surrendered here. Som are so life-like it seems they might speak of the horror. Leon approaches a pile of skulls which seem to form a circle. Suddenly, one skull comes to life. It’s a still-living head, and it moves out from the circle of skulls and dead men. 114 81. It’s Mahogany. The top of his head is shorn off. His eyes are bloodshot and furious. Leon steps back startled, but it’s not an hallucination.

She gives him the once-over, then turns back to the televisio She reaches behind and yanks the plug. The set blinks off Leon goes to an old desk and leans over something we cann see at first. As he leans over it, we recognize the BLACK VALISE. He takes out several corkscrew tools and inspects them. THE LID OF THE VALISE SLOWLY CLOSES ON ITS OWN. Leon steps up to the hallway door, he picks up a BLACK LEATHER BAG from the floor. We hear a quiet metallic clatter. Engraved on the leather is the name “Mahogany.” Leon pauses and cocks his head. Hodge now stands right behind Leon, and she takes a leath datebook out of her coat and presents it to him. It is th same datebook which Hodge took from Maya. Leon holds the book a minute, glances at its contents, th stuffs it inside his coat. He opens the outer door. A uniformed cop has his back to us in the doorway, but he moves to let Leon pass. And now the cop shuts the door.
