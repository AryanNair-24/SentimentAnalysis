21) 28) dialog: Hi.
21) 32) dialog: I'm Mary.
21) 34) dialog: Is that bad?
21) 38) dialog: Well, I don't know, but I would've thought that was quite bad - because no-one wants to sleep with their mother - so if someone's got your mother's name, that's got to be an initial turn off, initially.
21) 40) dialog: No. Well, good. It'd be worse if I looked like your mother. Unless your mother's very beautiful.
21) 42) dialog: Good. Or bad - for your Dad. I'm sorry for your Dad, but glad for you - and me, as it were. LITTLE AWKWARD PAUSE.
21) 44) dialog: Really badly. Can we start again?
21) 47) dialog: Jay is quite... enthusiastic.
21) 49) dialog: Basically she's a prostitute. TIM LAUGHS. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING.
21) 54) dialog: Okay.
21) 56) dialog: Here...
21) 58) dialog: No, that's my nose, unfortunately.
21) 61) dialog: She is / I am
21) 64) dialog: Actually, I look like Kate Moss.
21) 66) dialog: No. I look a bit like a mouse.
21) 68) dialog: I've loved her all my life. Seriously. I'm actually wearing one of her dresses. You?
21) 70) dialog: No, what do you think of her?
21) 91) dialog: Hi.
21) 96) dialog: You too.
21) 100) dialog: Very good to meet you too.
21) 102) dialog: You really like me? TIM JUST NODS. AND WALKS AWAY. HIS LIFE TRANSFORMED.
24) 29) dialog: Hello.
24) 31) dialog: I'm fine.
24) 33) dialog: We've never met before.
24) 35) dialog: You must've mistaken me for someone else.
24) 37) dialog: That's a bit weird. How do you know?
24) 42) dialog: And I look like your mother?
24) 44) dialog: Right - well... great meeting you. Sorry, I've got to go - my friend's waiting for me.
24) 50) dialog: Hello.
24) 52) dialog: Joanna, this is..?
24) 58) dialog: What about the girl you were with?
24) 60) dialog: (TO JOANNA)
24) 63) dialog: All right. You have to promise you are not one of the following things - 1/ a lunatic 2/ a stalker 3/ worst of all - a bore.
24) 65) dialog: Really? Do you agree the magic of her lies in her history - the informality of her early shots, compared to this stuff, so you always know, despite the high fashion, she's still just that same cheeky normal girl naked on the beach?
25) 3) dialog: Yes.
25) 7) dialog: No.
25) 9) dialog: Yes!
25) 11) dialog: Don't I look like I would have a boyfriend? (TO JOANNA)
25) 14) dialog: Yes. In fact - Rupert - over here.
25) 19) dialog: This is Tim. TIM IS HATING THIS.
25) 21) dialog: Gorgeous - she’s so beautiful.
25) 29) dialog: I'm going to have to teach you what you can and can't say in front of people.
25) 31) dialog: Definitely out. And don’t even think about 'fuckbucket'.
25) 33) dialog: Good. TIM AMUSED, THOUGH IT HURTS...
25) 42) dialog: What are you - a detective?
27) 3) dialog: Mary.
27) 5) dialog: That's my friend Joanna over there - she’s much prettier than me - shouldn't you hit on her first?
27) 8) dialog: Easier to get?
27) 10) dialog: Okay - I might come, if you’re not crazy. Which you now have to prove.
27) 12) dialog: I actually like Kate Moss.
27) 14) dialog: (AMAZED)
28) 3) dialog: I'm a reader at a publisher.
28) 5) dialog: (SENSING HIS IRONY)
28) 12) dialog: Okay - what do you do, smartarse?
28) 14) dialog: Sexy.
28) 17) dialog: I think so - in a suit, in a court saving people's lives - that's quite sexy, isn't it?
28) 19) dialog: Wait right there, mister. A lot of books get submitted to the publisher I work for, and it’s my responsibility to find out if any of them are masterpieces. No-one ever forgets the PWIDJKRALB.
28) 21) dialog: The People Who Turned Down JK Rowling And Lost Billions.
28) 23) dialog: Exactly. So it's an IMMENSE responsibility.
28) 28) dialog: You always worry about that?
28) 30) dialog: Good - because someone who always worried about that would be a worry.
29) 4) dialog: I'm going to go into the bedroom and put on my pyjamas.
29) 6) dialog: In about a minute, you can come in and take them off.
29) 11) dialog: It’s a front opener.
29) 18) dialog: I thought it was pretty lovely.
29) 20) dialog: Ah yes - man things...
29) 26) dialog: Wow. You know your bras.
29) 30) dialog: Wow. Well done - some guys make the most awful mess of it first time.
29) 36) dialog: It's like we've been together forever...
29) 40) dialog: O really. So my perfect man is a typical man after all. Once is always enough.
29) 42) dialog: Just one more little kiss.
29) 44) dialog: Perfect.
31) 2) dialog: I’ve got some bad news.
31) 4) dialog: Very bad.
31) 6) dialog: Not that bad?
31) 8) dialog: No. My parents are dropping round.
31) 10) dialog: Now.
31) 12) dialog: Now now.
31) 14) dialog: I have mentioned something like you - but nothing very specific.
31) 18) dialog: Definitely not.
31) 20) dialog: Yes, but probably not oral.
31) 22) dialog: Well don’t.
31) 24) dialog: I’m just saying - if it does, deny it completely.
31) 26) dialog: Dad. Mum. O, and this is Tim.
31) 29) dialog: Well, that’s quite tricky - because Tim sort of lives here.
31) 36) dialog: Dad. Mum. O, and this is Tim.
31) 39) dialog: Well, that’s quite tricky - because Tim sort of lives here.
31) 42) dialog: There isn’t a spare room.
31) 44) dialog: Coffee anyone? It’s a great morning drink.
31) 48) dialog: So not. I'm just going to sleep all day.
31) 51) dialog: No, take someone else.
36) 3) dialog: What?
36) 5) dialog: Sssh - I'm trying to sleep - don't be so selfish.
37) 3) dialog: O God, I am SO late.
37) 5) dialog: Yes.
37) 7) dialog: Yes - come on - what? (CHECKING WATCH)
37) 10) dialog: O my God. Ahm - SHE LOOKS AT HER WATCH. Really? You're doing this now?
37) 14) dialog: O God I am so late.
37) 16) dialog: Yeah. 56 INT. MARY'S FLAT. NIGHT. 57. AGAIN... 56 TIM IN THE KITCHEN WAITING, NERVOUSLY. POISED TO PROPOSE.
37) 17) dialog: O God - I am exhausted. I’m just going to jump in the shower.
37) 23) dialog: Hand me another towel, will you?
37) 25) dialog: Do you mind if I just have a little private moment?
37) 29) dialog: Okay. I’m all yours.
37) 33) dialog: I’m sorry? Was that a marriage proposal?
37) 35) dialog: Not a very romantic one.
37) 37) dialog: Maybe just a little bit more romantic than “turn that fucking thing off and tell me if you want to marry me or not.” But, no, it has a certain rough charm...
37) 45) dialog: Yes - and a bit dangerous and I'm getting a bit cold. Shall we go back in?
37) 59) dialog: Gorgeous. Very romantic.
37) 61) dialog: What?
37) 63) dialog: O my God. Is this a proposal? TIM SMILES AND NODS.
37) 64) dialog: In a garden, under an arch, in the moonlight - could it be any more romantic?
37) 69) dialog: O my God. Is this a proposal? In a floodlit garden, under an arch - could it be any more romantic?
37) 75) dialog: Slightly weird song for the occasion - ‘your looks are laughable, unphotographable’ .
37) 78) dialog: Honestly, you should have just asked me one night in bed.
37) 80) dialog: I think I'll go for 'yes’. Thanks for asking. Particularly cool since I'm actually pregnant.
37) 82) dialog: Yes. I'm going to be full of surprises, honey.
38) 0) text: OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF THE FAMILY HOME. MARY’S A BIT NERVOUS
38) 5) dialog: Don't be stupid. It’s all just mascara and lipstick.
38) 8) dialog: I'd love a cup of tea.
41) 3) dialog: Insecure.
41) 5) dialog: Bad temper sometimes.
41) 7) dialog: And I can’t hold my drink.
41) 9) dialog: Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Sometimes I sing, which is the ‘yes’, but sometimes I just fall asleep - that’s the ‘no’.
42) 0) text: MARY IS STANDING IN FRONT ALL THEM ALL. SINGING ADELE’S “SOMEONE LIKE YOU” BOISTEROUSLY.
42) 2) dialog: “I heard that you’re settled down, That you found a girl, and you’re married now, I heard your dream came true...”
43) 15) dialog: Yes. KIT KAT SCREAMS AGAIN.
43) 17) dialog: Tim here...
44) 3) dialog: We have to decide tonight.
44) 10) dialog: Everything you've refused to engage with. Best man. Honeymoon. Where we're marrying. How many guests.
44) 12) dialog: The only thing you've decided is that I will come down the aisle to the sound of an Italian weirdo singing a song called Il Mondo.
44) 14) dialog: To which I have said a definitive ‘no’. So here's the deal. I will take off one item of clothing for every decision you manage to make. This is a one off offer. Striptease, in your own living room, by a woman you think, by your own admission, is very pretty. PAUSE.
44) 16) dialog: Right. Good. Where do you think we should get married?
44) 18) dialog: Good. Who should the priest be?
44) 20) dialog: Okay, that's a lock for Hagrid.
44) 23) dialog: Ah. Right. I should have thought this through first.
44) 27) dialog: I should have worn more clothes.
44) 29) dialog: So I better pick two really important questions. Best man.
44) 31) dialog: Best man. Now.
44) 33) dialog: Do you want to see these puppies or not?
44) 35) dialog: The breasts are the border from which no decision can ever return. Harry? Really? SHE REACHES BACK FOR HER BRA STRAP.
44) 37) dialog: Your choice.
44) 39) dialog: He will fuck up everything, yes.
44) 42) dialog: Sure?
44) 44) dialog: Okay. It's Harry. WE SEE FROM BEHIND AS SHE FLICKS OFF HER BRA.
44) 46) dialog: That is such a cheat. But Rory it is - it's Rory and it can never change. Honeymoon? SHE PLACES HER THUMBS ON HER PANTS.
44) 48) dialog: Don’t think we can afford Venice...
46) 11) dialog: Really?
46) 57) dialog: Not for all the world.
47) 3) dialog: “And I-I-I will always love youououou...”
48) 3) dialog: O Jesus. It's coming.
48) 7) dialog: I've done it all - it's all in the bag.
48) 9) dialog: Everything. Every single thing. Just get the car. All you have to do is drive me to the hospital.
49) 2) dialog: Where are we going?
49) 4) dialog: Which is in the opposite direction.
49) 6) dialog: Okay - stop the car.
49) 8) dialog: No, it's not coming. I just want to point out you just had one job, that's ONE. The keeping fit, I did - the preparing the nursery, I did - the packing the bag, I did - the carrying the alien in my sodding stomach for nine years, I did. Your ONE AND ONLY job after impregnation was driving me to the hospital. Do you actually know which hospital we're going to?
49) 12) dialog: Which hospital?
49) 14) dialog: 
49) 20) dialog: 
49) 24) dialog: For God's sake - do something. There's a head appearing between my legs.
49) 54) dialog: What. The. Fourfold. Fuck. Are you doing?
49) 59) dialog: O my god - it really is coming noW...
51) 2) dialog: Oh Jesus. I think it's coming.
52) 2) dialog: Posy?
53) 12) dialog: O MY GOD. Where did this all come from?
54) 9) dialog: That'll be your Mum and Dad. Bizarrely early as ever.
54) 28) dialog: Don’t know. She said she'd be here around three. THE DOOR BELL GOES.
54) 68) dialog: You cut it fine.
54) 75) dialog: She couldn't come herself?
54) 78) dialog: I know. She was drinking vodka while we were drinking tea. And Jimmy wasn't nice to her.
54) 80) dialog: We can’t do that. If it’s going to be fixed, she has to fix it herself.
61) 3) dialog: Hello gorgeous. How was your day?
61) 5) dialog: Will you do dinner. There's something I've got to do before six or I get fired.
61) 19) dialog: Are you okay? You look like you've just seen a ghost.
63) 7) dialog: We did think of having a clown - Tim was particularly keen - but we thought Harry might kill him.
63) 9) dialog: Better just have family. TIM ISN’T QUITE JOINING IN...
67) 5) dialog: Another what? O, screw that. One is enough for me.
67) 16) dialog: Darling, I'm sick with nerves. What do you wear for dinner with the greatest author in the country??
67) 22) dialog: How about this?
67) 24) dialog: No. Take it seriously. I hate it. Makes me look lumpy.
67) 26) dialog: What about this?
67) 28) dialog: Not too breasty for Le Carre?
67) 30) dialog: It's too breasty.
67) 32) dialog: Yes. AND ANOTHER ONE.
67) 33) dialog: This?
67) 35) dialog: No, but I think high heels. Or my legs will look too short.
67) 40) dialog: But then we have the short legs problem. CUT TO THE NEXT ONE.
67) 41) dialog: I don't think this one is too bad.
67) 43) dialog: Really?
67) 45) dialog: What about the blue one? LITTLE PAUSE.
67) 47) dialog: Yes. Which do you prefer?
67) 49) dialog: Okay, let's go with this then. Although I think viz a viz breasts it's a bit disappointing. Where are the kids?
67) 51) dialog: Not in the room with the manuscript.
67) 55) dialog: You are joking. You left them in here. With the only copy of the book in existence apart from the one on John Le Carre's computer. I'll be fired. The company will be fired. My life is ruined. TIM GOES TO WALK OUT OF THE ROOM.
67) 58) dialog: Don't you dare leave the room. If you leave the room, I'm leaving you. I mean it - face it like a man. Talk to me - how could you be so stupid?
67) 60) dialog: 
67) 63) dialog: And don't you dare answer that. What are we going to do?
67) 65) dialog: And how do you suggest we reconstruct this? (A FULLY CHEWED
67) 69) dialog: If you answer the goddamn phone, I will kill you.
67) 74) dialog: NO! “Sorry, Mr Le Carre - we've read most of your book - but the rest of it got eaten, or coloured in - or actually shredded.”
67) 79) dialog: WHAT DO YOU WANT? Okay. Sorry I shouted, Helen. He'll explain. It's for you. Your Mum. TIM THE PHONE. HE TAKES THE PHONE AND JUST LISTENS.
67) 81) dialog: What is it?
67) 83) dialog: Is he all right?
70) 6) dialog: Thanks. The moment you die, I’m leaving him.
71) 3) dialog: What did you two talk about all that time?
71) 6) dialog: We decided it would be best if you never die. If you can work on immortality that would be great.
72) 2) dialog: What's your day tomorrow?
72) 21) dialog: How was it?
72) 23) dialog: Light off?
72) 65) dialog: So, not as bad a day as expected?
72) 68) dialog: That’s a relief. If it’d been a bad day, I thought I might have had to have sex with you to make up for it.
75) 7) dialog: Tough. Though I thought Jenny Arbuthnot looked cute in black.
75) 13) dialog: What do you think about the kids?
75) 15) dialog: Not very many, are there?
75) 21) dialog: I just thought. Maybe - you know - it's time for the insurance baby. In case one of them is really clever - we don't want the other one to spend their whole life feeling stupid - if we have another one, at least we could have two happy thickies.
75) 23) dialog: What do you think? KNOW IT’S A HUGE DECISION FOR HIM.
75) 25) dialog: Exactly.
76) 2) dialog: Could be tonight.
76) 47) dialog: I'll do the kids.
76) 49) dialog: Yes, you do them, lazy bastard.
76) 77) dialog: What time are you home tonight?
76) 79) dialog: 6. What do you fancy for dinner, my hungry husband?
76) 81) dialog: Risotto?
76) 83) dialog: Maybe chicken.
