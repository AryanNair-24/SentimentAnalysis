0) 7) dialog: I always knew we were a fairly odd family. First there was me - too tall, too skinny, too orange - unfortunate hair. My mum was lovely, but not like other mums - there was something solid about her, something rectangular - her fashion icon was the Queen Mother - I never remember her not in tweed. Dad, well, he was more normal. He always seemed to have time on his hands - after giving up teaching university students on his 50th birthday, was always available for a leisurely cup of tea, or to let me win at table tennis once more. Then there was Mum’s brother, Uncle D. Always impeccably dressed, he spent the days just, well, being Uncle D. He was the same age as Mum but by the time I was 8, he was really my younger brother. And then finally, there was Catherine, Katie, Kit Kat. Ina household of suits and hair cuts, there was this - what can I call her - nature thing. With her big oval eyes, her wild hair, her purple t-shirts, her torn jeans and her eternally bare feet - she was then and still is, to me, about the most wonderful thing in the world. All in all - it was a pretty good childhood - full of repeated rhythms and patterns - charades in the winter, with me always losing - (MORE)

0) 16) dialog: And then every Friday evening - a film.
0) 19) dialog: And then, once a year, the ghastly New Year’s Eve party...
1) 16) dialog: Happy New Year. Sorry.
1) 28) dialog: And so I woke up the next morning, hung over, ashamed of myself and not realising it was the day that would change my life forever. KIT KAT ENTERS IN THE PURPLE T-SHIRT SHE SLEEPS IN.
2) 9) dialog: This is all very formal.
2) 13) dialog: Okay - when you're ready. All very mysterious.
2) 17) text: Well, more accurately, travel back in time. I mean, once we’ve travelled back, we can of course travel forward back to the present, but we can't travel into the future from now. CUT BACK TO TIM. HE IS PERFECTLY STILL. THEN...
2) 18) dialog: This is such a weird joke...
2) 20) dialog: It’s got to be a joke.
2) 22) dialog: So you're saying that you, and granddad, and his brothers... could all travel back in time?
2) 24) dialog: And you still do?
2) 26) dialog: Okay - if it’s true - which it isn’t...
2) 28) dialog: Although it isn’t, obviously. But if it was, which it’s not...
2) 32) dialog: Which it isn’t - but if it was, how would I actually..?
2) 34) dialog: Wow.
2) 36) dialog: Do you mind if I just take a few moments to think about it?
2) 38) dialog: No - no - this is so obviously just a joke.
2) 40) dialog: Okay. Well, I mean, there’s obviously only one way to settle this.
2) 42) dialog: But when I come back downstairs - after standing in a cupboard with my fists clenched - you’re going to be in so much trouble. I mean it.
2) 44) text: Let’s see, shall we? And Tim... Try to do something useful. You want the first time to be interesting at least.
2) 45) dialog: So much trouble. I mean it. Really. INT. TIM’S BEDROOM. DAY. 5
3) 4) dialog: Yes. Good, good.
3) 13) dialog: You're welcome, Polly. AND HE HEADS OFF INTO A DARK ROOM, OFF THE PARTY ROOM... INT. TIM’S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 7 HE’S BACK IN THE CUPBOARD AGAIN. HE LOOKS AT HIS WATCH -
3) 21) dialog: Really?
3) 23) dialog: Great news.
3) 25) dialog: Great. Great. Will you just give me one second?
4) 3) dialog: I really AM sorry.
6) 3) dialog: Does Mum know?
6) 5) dialog: Strange. And what about the whole. .?
6) 7) dialog: It’s going to be a complicated year.
6) 9) dialog: Well, it’s going to take a lot of thinking about - what have you done... with it?
6) 13) dialog: Well, apart from changing this haircut, money would be the obvious thing.
6) 16) dialog: But it would be nice not to have to work.
6) 18) dialog: What happened to Uncle Fred?
6) 20) dialog: Well. I suppose, to be honest, for the moment, I really just hope it's going to get me a girlfriend.
6) 22) dialog: Yup - the mothership.
6) 23) dialog: For me, it was always going to be all about love. Of course - there were some old scores to be settled....

7) 6) dialog: Can I just say, sir, on behalf of all of us, that we also wish you the best - but fear the worst. You’re the worst teacher any student has ever had - you’re not only stupid, you’re arrogant, aggressive, sleazy and wouldn’t recognise an original thought if it gave you a tender and caring blow- job.
7) 8) dialog: Or not. Excuse I’m just popping to the toilet for a moment... INT. TIM’S ROOM. DAY. 13
7) 11) dialog: But it was in the summer holidays, that the real business began. I walked downstairs and into love.
7) 17) dialog: No it’s not. Excuse me.
7) 28) dialog: Hi, Charlotte.
7) 30) dialog: Really?
7) 32) dialog: O Jesus.
7) 34) dialog: No - he’s - he’s a character.
7) 37) dialog: You slept with Jimmy Kincade?
7) 39) dialog: Excuse me a moment. Can do better. THE CAR DRIVES BACK IN...
7) 41) dialog: Hi, Charlotte.
7) 43) dialog: O yes, what a guy. How is the old bastard?
7) 46) dialog: She was heaven. And staying the whole summer.
8) 4) dialog: Really? What do people wear in bed these days?
8) 6) dialog: Right. Of course. CUT BACK INSIDE HIS ROOM. HE’S NOW WEARING A T-SHIRT OVER
8) 10) dialog: No. T-shirt and boxers. Or nothing, of course. KIT KAT COMES ALONG THE CORRIDOR.
8) 12) dialog: What?
8) 14) dialog: Pyjamas? Not me. No. Bloody hell - pyjamas - come on!
8) 23) dialog: Yup. Be right there. HE DOES NOT MOVE.
9) 4) dialog: Absolutely. HE BOUNCES UP.
9) 8) dialog: Sure - give us a sec... HE READS A FEW MORE LINES (IT’S TOUGH TO DELAY, BUT HE DO
10) 0) text: IT’S DINNER - TIM, AS EVER, FOCUSSING ENTIRELY ON CHARLOT AND EVERYTHING SHE DOES. THEY ARE EATING SOUP.
10) 6) dialog: Excuse me one minute.
10) 11) dialog: The only problem with cauliflower, in my humble opinion, is that it always tastes like cauliflower.
10) 14) dialog: It was the summer from heaven - it was the summer from hell. I invited my friend Teddy round for tennis because I knew he’d make me look good.
10) 19) dialog: Unfortunately Charlotte just made both of us look like idiots. How the hell are you meant to concentrate on your game with this sort of shit going down?
10) 23) dialog: It never got better - until it was almost too late.
12) 2) dialog: Charlotte - as it’s the final day - the last night, can I... ask you a question?
12) 4) dialog: What?
12) 13) dialog: No, it was about... the other thing.
12) 16) dialog: Okay. Okay. Last night a bad idea?
12) 18) dialog: Okay. Good.
13) 3) dialog: Yes. Hi.
13) 5) dialog: Well, yes - there is just one thing - I know you’ve probably suspected this - but in the last fortnight, I have fallen completely in love with you. (MORE )
13) 7) dialog: Now, obviously, this was going to happen, because you’re the prettiest girl in history with the prettiest face and the prettiest hair... but even if, you know, you didn’t have the face and you had, absolutely no hair for some bizarre reason, I’d still adore you - not in a schoolboy way, in a really profound adult but not threatening way, and I just wondered whether by any chance you might share my feelings?
13) 9) dialog: Your last night.
13) 11) dialog: Right. Perfect. Just perfect. HE STANDS OUTSIDE THE DOOR ALONE. AND KNOWS THE TRUTH.
14) 4) dialog: And so the love of my life drove, just drove away. All the time travel in the world couldn't help me there. And the next day it was my turn to leave.
15) 10) dialog: I caught the train to London and headed for my digs, staying with an old friend of the family, who had apparently fallen on slightly hard times and needed the rent. It turned out to be just a few yards from Abbey Road - fans lining up by the crossing and risking their lives to have their photos taken...
15) 17) dialog: I'm James' son.
15) 19) dialog: James Lake.
15) 21) dialog: I'm his son. He said you had a room.
15) 27) dialog: Sorry.
15) 29) dialog: Really?
15) 35) dialog: No chance of that. HARRY LOOKS AT HIM SCORNFULLY.
16) 1) dialog: And so I began my adventures in the legal trade.
16) 3) dialog: It's a strange world, full of very strange people, both nice...
16) 6) dialog: And nasty.
16) 9) dialog: I’m Tim Lake.
16) 12) text: Only saying that to be nice - it’s two years actually. HE EXITS FULL OF TERROR, PULLING A DESPERATE FACE AT TIM.
16) 13) dialog: There are lots of things that time travel can’t help with. On the other hand - it’s extremely helpful in actual exams.
19) 4) dialog: For a while I tried to sublimate my search for love to getting a proper job - though it's not easy. Come exams, the girls all look like Kate Middleton. But I still just looked like me.
20) 5) dialog: Do you know - I'd love to - but I've got a date.
20) 7) dialog: No. It's a friend coming up from home. Male.
20) 9) dialog: Yes, I'd like to, but it's his birthday.
20) 12) dialog: I bet it’s not.
21) 5) dialog: No lights at all?
21) 7) dialog: You are fucking kidding me.
21) 17) dialog: I'll go for the meat menu, thank you.
21) 25) dialog: (EMBARRASSED )
21) 29) dialog: O Hello. I'm Tim.
21) 33) dialog: O. That's my mother's name.
21) 37) dialog: What do you mean?
21) 39) dialog: That's never occurred to me.
21) 41) dialog: She's not. She’s rectangular.
21) 43) dialog: How do you think the conversation is going?
21) 48) dialog: I actually hate him. What's Joanna like?
21) 51) dialog: I think it's strawberry mousse. Do you want to try it?
21) 55) dialog: Where's your mouth?
21) 57) dialog: There?
21) 65) dialog: Really?
21) 67) dialog: You like Kate Moss?
21) 69) dialog: No, her stuff doesn't look good on me.
21) 73) dialog: O - yeah - very pretty - though, I wish she looked a bit more like a mouse. AND SHE LAUGHS AT HIM. IT'S PROBABLY LOVE. 35 EXT. ‘DANS LE NOIR’ RESTAURANT. NIGHT. 35 CUT OUTSIDE. THE TWO BOYS HAVE THEIR COATS ON.
21) 75) dialog: Well, I don't know - but she sounded...
21) 94) dialog: Hi. A SMILE. IT IS DEFINITELY LOVE.
21) 95) dialog: Well... it was lovely meeting you.
21) 97) dialog: Would it be very immoral if I asked you for your number - just in case, you know, I ever...
21) 99) dialog: Thanks. Very good to meet you.
21) 101) dialog: If anybody mugs me for my phone, I will absolutely kill him before he takes it and your number away. BIG SMILE. THEY WALK APART, THEN SHE TURNS.
22) 2) dialog: What's the problem?
22) 4) dialog: O my God yes - how did it go?
22) 7) dialog: Really?
22) 9) dialog: No!
22) 11) dialog: It's a disaster?
22) 13) dialog: Okay. I'll see what I can do.
22) 15) dialog: Not quite that. HE RUNS UPSTAIRS AND STANDS IN HIS ROOM, FISTS CLENCHED.
22) 21) dialog: I'm just popping off for a minute.
22) 26) dialog: Hello, I'm a friend of Harry's.
22) 28) dialog: Yes, I appreciate that. It's just, I thought - ahm, how's it going with the lines?
22) 30) dialog: It's just - you know - in the court scene - some of those lines are pretty complex - I thought it might be worth just, you know, having one last look at the lines before you go on - a little refresher...
22) 67) dialog: Excuse me, excuse me...
22) 96) dialog: O no - fuck. EXT. ‘DANS LE NOIR’ RESTAURANT. NIGHT. 38 HOT AND HAVING RUN, TIM'S OUTSIDE “DANS LE NOIR”. HE CHEC HIS WATCH. IT'S 10.48.
22) 97) dialog: Shit. Shit. (RUSHES IN)
22) 100) dialog: That’s okay. Just the end of my life.
23) 9) dialog: I have to go out right now.
24) 6) dialog: Nice of you to keep me company, Kittle.
24) 8) dialog: How's Jimmy?
24) 10) dialog: Not again. And work?
24) 12) dialog: Idiots. Coffee?
24) 20) dialog: Soft face. Fringe. Bright eyes. The prettiest girl in the world. AND THEY WALK OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.
24) 23) dialog: O my God. It's her.
24) 26) dialog: Hi. SHE TURNS. VERY EMPTY LOOK, OF COURSE - HE'S A STRANGER.
24) 30) dialog: How are you?
24) 32) dialog: Great. PREGNANT PAUSE.
24) 34) dialog: O no. Fuck. Of course we haven't.
24) 36) dialog: Yes. No. No. Your name's Mary.
24) 38) dialog: You... look like a Mary. KIT KAT OBSERVING THIS SCEPTICALLY.
24) 41) dialog: Well, my Mum's called Mary. HE ISN'T DOING WELL - AND KNOWS IT.
24) 43) dialog: Not at all. Much prettier.
24) 45) dialog: Yes. Absolutely. HE TURNS IN DESPAIR TO KIT KAT.
24) 47) dialog: Very poor indeed. But let me handle it from here.
24) 49) dialog: Ahm, me again.
24) 51) dialog: Hello.
24) 53) dialog: Tim.
24) 57) dialog: Yes. I just had a weird experience with Mary here of thinking she was someone else I knew - but she wasn't BUT I just wondered if... I could walk round with you, because I'm... quite lonely.
24) 59) dialog: My sister. She had to go. Somewhere interesting. We’re a very interesting family.
24) 64) dialog: No. I'm just a big Kate Moss fan.
24) 66) dialog: Yes, I do agree.
25) 2) dialog: Milk?
25) 4) dialog: Sugar?
25) 8) dialog: Boyfriend?
25) 10) dialog: No! You don't have a boyfriend!
25) 13) dialog: No, no, I don't mean that. It’s just... I didn't expect - is he - quite a new boyfriend?
25) 15) dialog: (TO HIMSELF)
25) 23) dialog: Who is your type then?
25) 27) dialog: So tell me, when did you two meet?
25) 34) dialog: So, come on, more details. About the wonderful first meeting.
25) 38) dialog: Where?
25) 40) dialog: Which is where?
25) 43) dialog: No, no - I just have a very visual imagination - I like to, you know, imagine stuff completely.
25) 45) dialog: Absolutely. Excuse me - sorry - I've now suddenly got a bit of a tummy ache - watch out for those muffins - I'll be back in a tick.
26) 3) dialog: O god - I should have thought this through. Erm... Rupert!
26) 5) dialog: Hello.
26) 8) dialog: Yes - ahm - ahm - it's about your father.
26) 10) dialog: Yes - ahm - I'm afraid he's in real trouble.
26) 14) dialog: Well, I'm not at liberty to reveal that - but my strong advice would be that you go to see him straight away. RUPERT TAKES OUT HIS PHONE. TIM HAS TO ACT FAST.
26) 15) dialog: But don't ring him first.
26) 17) dialog: He's not at liberty to make or receive phone calls, I'm afraid.
26) 19) dialog: Right. (DRAWS BREATH)
26) 22) dialog: Yes.
26) 27) dialog: Paddington. Obviously. A FRIEND COMES BACK OUT TO THE STEPS.
26) 31) dialog: Just doing my job, friend. A CAB FLIES BY - RUPERT HAILS IT. CUT INSIDE THE CAB.
27) 2) dialog: Hi. I’m Tim.
27) 4) dialog: My mother's name. But let’s not get into that. You wouldn't like to come out to dinner with me, would you? Sometime in the next... hour.
27) 7) dialog: No, I like the look of you more.
27) 9) dialog: No. Just generally preferable.
27) 11) dialog: Well, let's talk about Kate Moss.
27) 13) dialog: I always think the key thing about her is the history. We all remember those fantastic pictures of her as a young school girl on a beach, so that even now, beneath all the glamour, we still see the wonderful young, impish amateur.
28) 2) dialog: So - what do you do?
28) 4) dialog: No! You read for a living.
28) 7) dialog: That’s so great - the rest of us, we just read, you know newspapers, books - but you, you get paid for it. (MORE)
28) 11) dialog: It's like someone asking, 'what do you do for a living?' - 'I breath, I'm a breather. I get paid for breathing'. How did you get that job?
28) 13) dialog: I'm a lawyer. Sort of.
28) 15) dialog: (GENUINELY SURPRISED)
28) 18) dialog: Yes, I guess it is. But not as sexy as reading. Sitting there, in your office, in a little chair - reading.
28) 20) dialog: What's that?
28) 22) dialog: Of course. Scary...
28) 24) dialog: I bet it is. And does this mean when you’re doing normal reading, it's ruined, because it's your job? (MORE)
28) 27) dialog: Like prostitutes. I always worry that when they stop being prostitutes, they can't enjoy sex any more.
28) 29) dialog: No, I sometimes worry about it.
28) 31) dialog: Right - but, when you read a newspaper, do you think, “o fuck this - it's work”? Or a menu - 'I'm not reading this unless you pay me hard cash...” THEY ARE COMPLETELY ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH...
29) 5) dialog: Right.
29) 12) dialog: O yes - of course. Thanks.
29) 17) dialog: Sorry. I'm sure it'll be better second time.
29) 19) dialog: Well, right, yes, it was lovely. Just give me... one minute.
29) 27) dialog: I like to think so.
29) 31) dialog: Pah - amateurs. Could you... excuse me just one second...
29) 37) dialog: If only. Best night of my adult life... CUT ON - AND OFF COMES HER PYJAMA TOP AGAIN. CUT TO THEM IN BED AGAIN. THEY ARE UTTERLY EXHAUSTED.
29) 39) dialog: Best night of my entire life. And now I've got a suspicion I'm going to have the best sleep of my life.
29) 41) dialog: I'm not sure that's completely fair.
29) 43) dialog: It's 4 in the morning.
31) 3) dialog: How bad?
31) 5) dialog: You're dying?
31) 7) dialog: I'm dying?
31) 9) dialog: O God. No. When?
31) 11) dialog: Now now?
31) 13) dialog: Do they know I exist?
31) 17) dialog: Do I live here?
31) 19) dialog: Are we having sex?
31) 21) dialog: I wasn’t going mention oral.
31) 23) dialog: How did you think that was going to come up?
31) 25) dialog: Who's going to bring it up? Your Dad? “Tim - had any cunnilingus with my daughter recently?” MARY OPENS THE DOOR. THERE ARE THE PARENTS.
31) 27) dialog: Hello, sir. Ma’am.
31) 31) dialog: Yes. But no oral sex, I promise you.
31) 35) dialog: Excuse me. THE DOOR OPENS AGAIN.
31) 37) dialog: Hello, sir.
31) 41) dialog: Yes. But in the spare room.
31) 43) dialog: No. But in the spare bit of her room where she isn’t. In other words —- no sex. Of any kind. Especially not...
31) 47) dialog: I've got tickets for the National Theatre tomorrow. Do you want to come?
31) 50) dialog: I don't see why going to the theatre should get in the way of that. Many of the best sleeps of my life have happened in the Royal Shakespeare Company.
31) 52) dialog: What kind of sad act is going to be free on a Saturday night with no day's notice?
32) 6) dialog: O my God. It's Charlotte.
32) 8) dialog: My first real love.
32) 10) dialog: There.
32) 12) dialog: No, not the old woman - the astonishing blonde.
32) 14) dialog: No - blonde - blonde means with blonde hair. AND THERE SHE IS, EXQUISITE, MYSTERIOUS, IN THE CROWD.
32) 15) dialog: Stay there - I mean it - stay.
32) 19) dialog: Charlotte.
32) 22) dialog: Charlotte.
32) 24) dialog: No!
32) 27) dialog: That is so brilliant - hello Tina.
32) 29) dialog: Well, you know there are certain moments in your life that scar you for life - and Charlotte's rejection of me was one of those moments - totally screwed up my self-confidence. But now I know she's got a... girlfriend that's suddenly a huge burden off my mind - I can be a confident heterosexual all over again.
32) 31) dialog: What?
32) 35) dialog: O. No. Of course. ‘girlfriend’ - yes. No. Wow. Friend who is a girl. So - I'm just going to get my boy- friend - I'm very keen you should meet him. AND BACK IN TIME AGAIN - TIM APPROACHES CHARLOTTE.
32) 36) dialog: Charlotte.
32) 39) dialog: Hello, Tina - though you should be a little careful with that, by the way. There are still quite a lot of us old-fashioned types who interpret 'girlfriend' as sort of meaning 'gay' so if you say Tina's your girlfriend, people will assume you're 'gay'.
32) 41) dialog: No, I don't. Love that stuff. BACK IN THE STALLS - JUST AT THE END OF THE PLAY.
32) 42) dialog: Wow - I just saw the girl who broke my heart three summers ago.
32) 44) dialog: No, best let sleeping dogs lie.
33) 2) dialog: What did you think of it then?
33) 7) dialog: Charlotte. What a... surprise.
33) 12) dialog: Shut up. Hello, Tina.
33) 14) dialog: Well, yes, great. I'd love that.
33) 16) dialog: She's fine. She's okay. Not finding London totally easy...
33) 18) dialog: (NOT HAPPY)
33) 22) dialog: She means your name.
33) 29) dialog: Yes - but you notice she didn't give me her number... THEN SUDDENLY, THERE SHE IS AGAIN.
33) 31) dialog: Sod off, Rory.
34) 0) text: THEY’RE EATING IN A LOVELY OUTSIDE RESTAURANT. LOTS OF LAUGHING... TIM IS VERY HAPPY TO BE WITH HER.
34) 2) dialog: Hal
34) 4) dialog: You didn’t say ‘no’ - you laughed. You went ‘ha ha ha’.
34) 6) dialog: That was it - that was exactly the sound - the sound of my confidence dying for a decade. LITTLE PAUSE.
34) 10) dialog: So... SO... (AND HE MAKES UP HIS MIND)
36) 4) dialog: Would you like to marry me?
36) 6) dialog: Right. That went well, I think.
37) 4) dialog: Mary.
37) 6) dialog: I've got something I really need to ask you.
37) 9) dialog: I just wondered if you'd like, eventually, at some time in the future... to marry me.
37) 11) dialog: Sorry. I'm just popping out for a second.
37) 15) dialog: See you tonight then.
37) 18) dialog: (RESIGNED)
37) 22) dialog: Mary.
37) 24) dialog: Yes. Mary.
37) 26) dialog: Of course.
37) 30) dialog: Mary. AND ON GOES THE HAIR DRYER.
37) 32) dialog: O for Christ’s sake turn that fucking thing off and... THIS IS THE MOMENT SHE TURNS IT OFF. ...tell me whether you want to marry me or not?
37) 34) dialog: Yes.
37) 36) dialog: No. You want more romantic?
37) 38) dialog: I’ll be back in a minute. BACK TO HER IN THE SHOWER. HE OPENS THE CURTAIN.
37) 39) dialog: I think we should go out to dinner.
37) 44) dialog: Isn't this gorgeous?
37) 46) dialog: Just give me a moment...
37) 51) dialog: We're going out for a walk - do you think you could turn on the lights in the garden?
37) 53) dialog: And can I borrow a couple of coats?
37) 58) dialog: This is pretty gorgeous, isn't it?
37) 60) dialog: God - what's this? There’s something in the pocket of the coat...
37) 62) dialog: Let's see. Here have a look... HE TAKES OUT A LITTLE BOX, SHE OPENS IT - IT’S AN ENGAGEM RING.
37) 65) dialog: Well, actually - give me a minute.
37) 72) dialog: Well, actually...
37) 76) dialog: 
37) 79) dialog: Don’t think I didn’t try. Any thoughts about the answer? 'Yes' / ‘No’ / 'Maybe' all possible. PAUSE.
37) 81) dialog: No!
38) 1) dialog: Most important - if they offer you a cup of tea - just say 'no'.
38) 9) dialog: O Christ, that's the whole day gone.
39) 2) dialog: What happened when Dad asked you to marry him?
39) 4) dialog: Really - how lovely - how lucky, Dad.
40) 4) dialog: How many times?
40) 6) dialog: Did you do the proposal to Mum.

42) 8) dialog: Fast asleep.
42) 10) text: And what an extraordinary game this is - for the first time a father and son are playing each other in the World Table Tennis final - and neither of them are Chinese. Tremendous play by the old world champion and his son, the first openly gay British ping-pong player. But it feels like the youngster's beginning to crack - there are tears in his eyes...
42) 11) dialog: There are not.
42) 15) dialog: I didn't know you were here.
42) 18) dialog: What about the job? SHE WRINKLES HER NOSE - OBVIOUSLY THE JOB IS NO MORE.
42) 19) dialog: How long have you been here?
42) 21) dialog: Wow. So life in London?
42) 23) dialog: Yes.
42) 25) dialog: Outside, I think. KIT KAT RUSHES OFF - HE CALLS AFTER HER...
42) 26) dialog: Be gentle - be gentle... BUT IT’S TOO LATE - KIT KAT CHARGES OUT THE DOOR - SEES M
43) 2) dialog: Right - I've got an important announcement to make.
43) 6) dialog: No, it's not war, Uncle D. It’s that we've decided to get married.
43) 10) dialog: Mary here.
43) 13) dialog: Thank you. O, and by the was... the wedding will be quite soon, because we're having a baby too.
44) 4) dialog: What?
44) 11) dialog: We haven't decided any of those?
44) 13) dialog: Excellent...
44) 15) dialog: Okay. You have my attention, young lady.
44) 17) dialog: Home - I’d hate anywhere else. OFF HER T-SHIRT, AND IS WEARING A BRA UNDERNEATH.
44) 19) dialog: The local bloke with the yellow teeth and massive uni-brow...
44) 26) dialog: Yes.
44) 28) dialog: Yes.
44) 30) dialog: Damn. I really want to see those breasts, but...
44) 32) dialog: This is SO hard. It's lose/lose - you piss off all the ones you don't pick and you end up hating the one you do pick because he makes an embarrassing speech and ruins your day.
44) 34) dialog: (VERY TENTATIVE) Harry?
44) 36) dialog: No. Bad idea. He'll get drunk. Jay?
44) 38) dialog: He's my best friend, but he’s a moron.
44) 40) dialog: Rory - he's boring - but he'll try SO hard...
44) 43) dialog: Yes. Definitely. Rory. No, Harry. It's Harry.
44) 45) dialog: Actually, no - Rory.
44) 47) dialog: Wow - this is turning into an exceptionally good night. I know this one! VENICE!!!
44) 49) dialog: Anywhere, anywhere literally....
46) 10) dialog: I'm going to go for Jay.
46) 12) dialog: Yeh - he might be funny and I'm pretty sure we can rein him in...
46) 18) dialog: Do you know, I know it's unusual, but I think I'll go for Dad. CUT TO DAD FINISHING HIS TOAST AND IT'S GOING WELL...
46) 24) dialog: You did, Dad - it was implied...
46) 26) dialog: Don't do it - it's fine - I'm really happy with it as it was - you really don't have to.
46) 47) dialog: I see you've met my mother-in-law.
46) 56) dialog: Do you wish we'd picked another day?
48) 6) dialog: O Jesus. What do we need? Ahm...
48) 8) dialog: Nappies? Phone chargers?
48) 10) dialog: Right. Okay. Excellent.
49) 3) dialog: To the hospital.
49) 5) dialog: Of course it is.
49) 7) dialog: Is it coming? (THE BABY...)
49) 9) dialog: Yes.
49) 13) dialog: Ahm...
49) 19) dialog: Either St. Mark something or Paddington something?
49) 27) dialog: O Christ - Abbey Road.
49) 31) dialog: Could you just, you know, hurry up?
49) 33) dialog: Yes, I know. Fast as you can.
49) 37) dialog: Terribly sorry, but, could you just... THEY IGNORE HIM.
49) 42) dialog: Look, I'll do it - okay. Jesus - be careful.
49) 45) dialog: Right. The thing is, though, that my wife is having a baby...
49) 47) dialog: Look, I know what...
49) 51) dialog: (UTTERLY PANICKING) What?
49) 57) dialog: I know it seems - it was really complicated - I promise this was the quickest...
49) 60) dialog: Abbey Road! HE POINTS TO THE STUDIOS AND RUNS IN.
50) 3) dialog: Sorry. My mistake.
50) 6) dialog: That's better.
51) 4) dialog: Cool - I've finalised the route. The car is outside on a special parking metre. St. Mary's Paddington, here we come... And I think we should avoid Abbey Road.
52) 3) dialog: Posy she is. The most beautiful girl in the world.
52) 4) dialog: No one can ever prepare you for what happens when you have a child... (MORE)
52) 6) dialog: When you see the baby in your arms and you know that's your job now. No one can prepare you for the love and the fear. CUT TO TIM WATCHING AS POSY RESTS IN HIS MUM'S ARMS.
52) 11) dialog: (NERVOUS) Ahm, do you think that's...? Yes, sure. Sure...
53) 1) dialog: There are other things, of course - no one can prepare you for the bad nappies... MARY AND TIM IN THE LIVING ROOM. THEY HEAR THE BABY CRY..
53) 2) dialog: Let me do it, darling.
53) 7) dialog: Why don't you do this one - I've got a big case tomorrow...
53) 14) dialog: No one can prepare you for the love people you love can feel for them...
53) 18) dialog: Are you sure you're okay?
53) 20) dialog: And nothing can prepare you for the indifference of friends who don't have babies...
54) 4) dialog: And nothing can prepare you for how small a place that seemed a good size suddenly becomes... THE FLAT IS JUST FULL OF PRAMS, NAPPIES, FOOD, BABY BED..
54) 5) dialog: And how quickly you have to move to a place you can’t quite afford.
54) 7) dialog: It's just the sheer shock of the pure unconditional love for this human fluke that happens to be yours... INT. TIM AND MARY’S HOUSE. DAY. 78
54) 11) dialog: Hello, Mum, Dad. Uncle D. Wonderful to see you. Come on in. And look, if it isn't Godfather Rory... RORY IS CARRYING THE LARGEST TEDDY BEAR IN HISTORY.
54) 26) dialog: We thought of having a clown but decided against it - best keep first birthdays small, just family, two friends, one giant stuffed toy.
54) 29) dialog: Speak of the devil...
54) 32) dialog: Jimmy - what can I do for you? And where's my sister?
54) 34) dialog: No - she never arrived.
54) 36) dialog: What does that mean? What does ‘that's not good' mean?
54) 41) dialog: There's a song by Baz Luhrmann, called Sunscreen - and I've never forgotten two lines from it - “Worrying about the future is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum. The real troubles in your life will always be things that never crossed your worried mind.”
54) 48) dialog: What happened?
54) 53) dialog: It was tea time. On a weekday.
54) 55) dialog: I blame Jimmy.
54) 57) dialog: Well, so you say...
54) 63) dialog: Not good. When did she leave you? And from where? I want it exact - exact time, exact address.
54) 67) dialog: I know. I love ‘em. CUT BACK TO THE FRONT DOOR, FOUR HOURS EARLIER.
54) 69) dialog: Sorry - I had to pick up Kit Kat.
54) 76) dialog: No, as it turns out, she couldn't. CUT BACK TO THEM AFTER THE PARTY. RELAXING IN THE CHAOS..
54) 77) dialog: I'm worried about Kit Kat.
54) 79) dialog: We have to do fix it.
54) 81) dialog: Maybe. Maybe not.
55) 4) dialog: Darling Kit Kat...
55) 6) dialog: You're not. But I AM a little worried...
55) 8) dialog: It's just, you know, this is a strange place for you still to be coming all the time. Here with Mum and Dad and Uncle D...
55) 10) dialog: Indeed. But, what's happened? You're the best person in the world. Top equal with my wife. And the dog in The Artist. I don't quite get it.
55) 13) dialog: And getting drunk.
55) 16) dialog: What happened with Marcus? He seemed a nicer guy than your usual.
55) 18) dialog: And so you end up back with Jimmy. PAUSE.
56) 3) dialog: Stupid.
56) 5) dialog: You know I've spent my entire life taking the piss out of you because you believe in total crap.
56) 7) dialog: Horoscopes...
56) 9) dialog: Acupuncture...
56) 13) dialog: The Electric Light Orchestra...
56) 15) dialog: Exactly. All your beliefs, total codswallop. But, oddly, you may have had a point after all. I'm going to tell you a secret - but you have to keep it.
56) 17) dialog: We have.
56) 19) dialog: I know. Thank you for never telling anyone.
56) 22) dialog: You promise you won't ever tell.
56) 24) dialog: I can travel in time.
57) 3) dialog: Because we're going to go back in time - and you are going to do some things differently...
57) 5) dialog: Hold my hand. WE SEE THEIR HANDS CLENCH.
57) 13) dialog: ‘Fraid so.
57) 15) dialog: My point precisely.
57) 21) dialog: Hello, Jenny. KIT KAT AND TIM EXCHANGE A LOOK...
57) 23) dialog: Okay - now we’ve got work to do.
57) 25) dialog: We are making sure you do NOT meet Jimmy Kincade. And - quick - in here...
57) 29) dialog: Not this time you don’t. ANOTHER FRIEND ACCOSTS KIT KAT.
57) 37) dialog: No. Next door.
57) 41) dialog: Come on.
57) 60) dialog: And now we leave.
57) 65) dialog: God only knows - but what I’m hoping is that from this moment on you avoid the sleazy bad guys - because they’re sleazy and bad. So you don’t spend your life feeling worthless, giving up every job on some bastard's whim, living in horrible flats waiting for the phone to ring.
57) 67) dialog: Since it occurred to me that I might lose you. PAUSE AS SHE REGISTERS HIS REAL CONCERN.
57) 69) dialog: Back to the future.
58) 4) dialog: Thanks, I know. We can’t resist them. THEY STAND INSIDE THE DARK CUPBOARD.
58) 6) dialog: Yes. I always do. But the new one is the real one - the old one is something you luckily escaped. CLEANER ENTERS TO SEE THIS SLIGHTLY STRANGE SCENE.
58) 8) dialog: Sorry - just give us ONE second.
59) 3) dialog: What?
59) 5) dialog: Teddy Frankman?
61) 4) dialog: Immensely satisfactory.
61) 7) dialog: I can't think of anything I'd love to do more. HE GOES INTO THE NEXT ROOM.
61) 8) dialog: Where is the most gorgeous person in the world? Come to your Dad and get food shoved into your mouth.
61) 18) dialog: Just stay there... little boy. And I'll be back in a minute. HE HEADS OUT INTO THE CORRIDOR.
61) 20) dialog: Yes. No. I’m great. HE ISN'T. HE HEADS INTO THE BATHROOM. CLOSES THE DOOR. CLENCHES HIS FISTS.
62) 3) dialog: Dad - can we talk for just a moment? HIS DAD COMES OUT INTO THE CORRIDOR.
62) 4) dialog: I can't go back past this again, can I?
62) 7) dialog: So every day up till yesterday is as it will always be? Lost.
62) 9) dialog: Okay - okay. Interesting. Tough. Love you, Dad. Got to go.
62) 11) dialog: Kittle - I’m really worried.
62) 13) dialog: You...
62) 15) dialog: And Jimmy.
63) 2) dialog: I want to talk about Jimmy. I really, really think he’s a bad...
63) 6) dialog: Okay. Okay. INT. TIM AND MARY’S HOUSE. DAY. 92 WE ARE BACK AT THE START OF THE BABY’S PARTY - EVERYONE T EXCEPT KIT KAT.
64) 0) text: WE SEE KIT KAT’S CAR CRASH HAPPENING AGAIN. TIM HAS HAD T LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN.
65) 4) dialog: Yes.
65) 8) dialog: No. I’m not leaving this room till we find a way of making sure this never happens again. AN HOUR LATER...
65) 10) dialog: Good start. But there’s more. Seriously. You have to work it out.
65) 12) dialog: Me too. CUT TO THE NEXT MORNING. SAME SITUATION.
65) 14) dialog: That too. Keep thinking.
66) 6) dialog: Matt Damon?
66) 9) dialog: Pat Damon, his twin brother? Or Nat Damon, the youngster in the family. SCEPTICAL PAUSE.
66) 10) dialog: Tell me. Do you remember Teddy Frankman?
66) 12) dialog: Just, you know, popped into my head. What's he like these days?
66) 14) dialog: I’m thinking of asking him to dinner. You free?
66) 16) dialog: No! No! Out! Right now! You are so totally and utterly out of the picture I can't fucking tell you.
67) 4) dialog: Let's have another one.
67) 10) dialog: And that's another big strange thing - you pour all your possible love into one child... POSY, NOW GETTING BIGGER IS RUNNING TOWARDS HIM.
67) 11) dialog: And this is incredible, Posy Lake, only three years old, is about to break the Women’s Olympic record, if only her trousers can stay up... WHICH THEY DON’T. SHE TRIPS AND FALLS.
67) 12) dialog: And then you have another one, and it turns out you've got exactly the same amount of love on tap... HE'S SWINGING HIS SON ROUND AS THEY WALK ON.
67) 13) dialog: Love, this extraordinary ingredient that has no limits, ever expanding, self-reproducing. And all the time you love the woman you love as much as you ever loved her... 98 INT. TIM AND MARY’S HOUSE. EVENING. 98
67) 17) dialog: I'll settle the kids and come straight up.
67) 23) dialog: Gorgeous. Job done. SHE CHECKS HERSELF IN THE FULL-LENGTH MIRROR TO HER LEFT.
67) 25) dialog: Right. I hate it too. A SHARP CUT - SHE RE-EMERGES IN ANOTHER DRESS.
67) 27) dialog: Gorgeous. We did it!
67) 29) dialog: No.
67) 31) dialog: Is it?
67) 34) dialog: Not too breasty.
67) 36) dialog: Which they aren't, but whatever makes you feel good. High heels are great. SHE NOW HAS THE HIGH HEELS ON.
67) 39) dialog: Not high heels then.
67) 42) dialog: I think it's fabulous.
67) 44) dialog: Yes.
67) 46) dialog: The first one? The lumpy one that wasn't actually lumpy?
67) 48) dialog: I don't know. I'm actually starting to go a bit mad now. SHE EMERGES IN THE ORIGINAL DRESS.
67) 50) dialog: I left them downstairs.
67) 52) dialog: I don't think so...
67) 57) dialog: Okay - take it easy - I'm just going to...
67) 59) dialog: I just have to...
67) 64) dialog: Look, I'm sure we can, you know, reconstruct it.
67) 67) dialog: Well, no, that's not going to be particularly easy. May not be a very important page... PAUSE. THE PHONE RINGS ON.
67) 68) dialog: I really think we should...
67) 73) dialog: All right. I won't answer the phone. But I must just go to the little room... IS STILL RINGING.
67) 75) dialog: Yes - I had no idea Posy actually knew how to use that machine. In a way, it's impressive, though obviously not in a particularly good way today.
67) 80) dialog: Right - we'll come up. HE HANGS UP.
67) 82) dialog: Dad. I'll call Kit Kat.
67) 84) dialog: No, he's not.
67) 89) dialog: Mum. How are you?
67) 92) dialog: Why not?
67) 96) dialog: D. How are you?
67) 98) dialog: Yes.
67) 100) dialog: He does.
67) 104) dialog: Dad.
67) 108) dialog: What?
67) 112) dialog: The truth.
67) 115) dialog: How long?
67) 117) dialog: How long really?
67) 120) dialog: Have we had this conversation before?
67) 122) dialog: What happened?
67) 126) dialog: I know - but you must see, I feel a bit cheated.
67) 128) dialog: Right - so that was...
67) 130) dialog: Is there anything at all I can do?
69) 6) dialog: O Christ - there's not another secret?
69) 8) dialog: No - tell me. Let’s save some time.
70) 3) dialog: I will. Thank you.
71) 4) dialog: Stuff. And you and Mum?
71) 9) dialog: You’re such a wonderful woman. I’m so lucky to have you.
72) 3) dialog: Ghastly. Long, boring meeting. Very difficult case - very late night.
72) 12) dialog: Hey Kit Kat. How's things? O Good - great. Look, I'm sorry, this isn't a great time. Maybe later. Okay. Okay. Well look, that's great - I'm really pleased. Wow. Great. Good old Teddy. Urgh. Honey - this is so not the right time - I'm needed in court in about five minutes. Okay. Yes. I'm going to have to go or I'll lose my job. Let's talk later. Okay. Okay.
72) 22) dialog: Tough. Dull. Tense. Time for bed. CUT TO THEM IN BED.
72) 24) dialog: Yes - though I might just pop to the bathroom first... CUT TO TIM IN THE BATHROOM.
72) 25) dialog: Okay, Dad, let’s give it a go. HE SHUTS HIS FISTS AND TRAVELS.
72) 39) dialog: Give me a second.
72) 41) dialog: Just...
72) 45) dialog: Hey Kit Kat. How's everything? You're kidding! You’re kidding! O Christ - I’m so sorry I’m in a tiny bit of a rush...
72) 66) dialog: No, pretty good actually. Very good day really.
72) 69) dialog: It was a very bad day. It went very badly. I lost my job. I killed a man. And I think I just heard one of our children die downstairs.
72) 72) dialog: And so I began to live the new life my Dad gave me. Each day, lived twice. Once with all the strains and tensions that stop us noticing how sweet the world can be - and once, well, noticing.
73) 3) dialog: Some days, of course, though, you only want once...
74) 8) dialog: Just give me one minute.
74) 15) dialog: Read away. We've got all the time in the world. PAUSE - THERE'S SOMETHING ODD IN THE AIR AS TIM SITS.
74) 18) dialog: Immaculate.
74) 20) dialog: Quite sexy actually.
74) 22) dialog: Yes - all set.
75) 5) dialog: Tough.
75) 8) dialog: True. She knows how to excite a man. INT. TIM AND MARY’S HOUSE. NIGHT. 112
75) 14) dialog: What about them?
75) 16) dialog: I'm sorry?
75) 22) dialog: You're so romantic.
75) 24) dialog: Cool. Cool. Dad always wished there had been more of us... And anyway - we might try and nothing happens.
76) 3) dialog: And you cannot believe the detail in which I know the route to the hospital. Will you excuse me for a sec - there's something I've got to finish.
76) 11) dialog: You finally got good.
76) 13) dialog: A kiss will have to do.
76) 19) dialog: Yes. This is it.
76) 22) dialog: My Dad. THEY BOTH SMILE. PAUSE.
76) 24) dialog: It's never going to happen.
76) 29) dialog: So now I'm almost up to date with my story. Sometimes, just for fun - I still bounce around -
76) 32) dialog: Mum - surprisingly modern and good taste gift for you.
76) 37) dialog: I think it's GORGEOUS.
76) 44) dialog: But in the end, I think I've at last learnt the full message from my strange adventures in time - the truth is I now don't travel back at all, not even for the day. I just live every day as if I I’ve deliberately come back to this one day - to enjoy it as if it was the full, final day of my lucky life...
76) 48) dialog: No, don't worry - I'll do them.
76) 54) dialog: 
76) 71) dialog: We'll get through it.
76) 78) dialog: About 9, I hope. You?
76) 80) dialog: You decide.
76) 82) dialog: What flavour?
76) 84) dialog: Chicken would be absolute heaven. HE HANGS UP, STEPS FORWARD. FREEZE.
