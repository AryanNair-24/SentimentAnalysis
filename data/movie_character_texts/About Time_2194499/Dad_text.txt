2) 8) dialog: Ah, Tim, come in... Do sit down.
2) 12) dialog: Well, yes, ahm, this is an odd moment for me - because I had exactly the same moment with my Father, when I’d just turned 21 - and after it, my life was never the same - so, I approach it pretty nervously.
2) 16) dialog: Alright. Right. Tim - my dear son - the simple fact is that the men in this family have always had the ability to... This is going to sound strange. Be prepared for strangeness. But there’s this family secret - and the secret is that all the men in the family can - travel in time. (HEADING ON FAST)
2) 19) dialog: It’s not a joke.
2) 21) dialog: It’s seriously not a joke.
2) 23) dialog: Yes.
2) 25) dialog: Absolutely.
2) 27) dialog: Although it is...
2) 31) dialog: Which it is...
2) 33) dialog: The 'how’ is the easy bit in fact. You go into a dark place - big cupboards very useful generally - toilets at a pinch - then you clench your fists like this, think about the moment you’re going to, and you'll find yourself there. After a bit of a stumble and a rumble and a tumble.
2) 35) dialog: .»..is as good a reaction as any. I think I plumped for 'fuck'. But it was the 80s.
2) 37) dialog: Please do. I’1l just be here. TIM HEADING OUT.
2) 39) dialog: It’s not. Why would I lie?
2) 41) dialog: Yes. Obviously.
6) 4) dialog: Not a whistle.
6) 6) dialog: Butterfly effect thing - what can I say, we don't seem to have messed up civilization yet...
6) 8) dialog: It’s going to be complicated life. Any ideas how to use it?
6) 10) dialog: For me it’s books, books, books. I've read everything a man could hope to. Twice. Dickens three times. And music of course.
6) 15) dialog: Very mixed blessing. Utterly fucked up your grandfather's life - left him without love or friends. I've never bumped into a genuinely happy rich person.
6) 17) dialog: No - that’s a real recipe for disaster. Look what happened to your Uncle Fred.
6) 19) dialog: Nothing. Absolutely sod all. Wasted his life. You have to use it for things that will really make your life how you want it to be.
6) 21) dialog: Wow. Big one.
10) 5) dialog: Ah - the only problem with cauliflower I find, is that it tastes like cauliflower. CHARLOTTE LAUGHS A LOT AT THAT.
10) 9) dialog: What flavour is the soup?
11) 3) dialog: Well, Charlotte, our final lunch - it's been lovely having you all summer, hasn't it, Uncle D.
26) 20) text: Well then let me explain the actual scenario. I'm a plain clothes policeman and I'm doing you a fucking favour because I know how badly these things can affect the kids - so, risking my career, I'm telling you to move your posh arse in the direction of Paddington Police station. You weren't your Dad's one phone call because he called his lawyer because he doesn't want to rot in jail for 50 years - but now he desperately needs a friend - and my sources tell me you may be the only member of the family left, with your mother... gone. But, of course, you could just go get drunk instead, and leave him to suffer - miserably - alone - forever. RUPERT LOOKS AT HIM.
31) 28) dialog: Shall we drop back when you haven’t got company?
31) 32) dialog: I beg your pardon.
31) 38) dialog: Shall we drop back when you haven’t got company?
39) 5) dialog: (WITH A TWINKLE)
40) 5) dialog: What?
40) 8) dialog: O God - I mean, 10. Took a fortnight.
40) 10) dialog: Greatest song ever recorded by an Italian who looks like he has a dead badger on his head.
42) 3) dialog: (TO TIM )
42) 7) dialog: Where’s Mary?
42) 9) dialog: Sweet. Right - (TV COMMENTING)
42) 12) dialog: There soon will be. A TRIUMPHANT SMASH. INT. HALLWAY. DAY. 64
43) 12) dialog: Can I say I've only known Mary for a few hours, but already I'm sure, in the event of a nasty divorce, I'm sticking with her, not Tim.
46) 21) dialog: And so, a toast to the man with the worst haircut, but the best wife in the room. THEY ALL LAUGH AND CLAP AND TIM SMILES AT HIM.
46) 23) dialog: I wish I'd said that I love you.
46) 25) dialog: I'm not sure 'implied' is good enough for a wedding day, are you? PAUSE - THEY BOTH KNOW WHAT HE MEANS.
46) 27) dialog: I'll do what I want to do, young man. CUT BACK TO THE NEW SPEECH...
46) 28) dialog: My natural instinct of course is to try to be funny about my son - so many flaws - plays table tennis like a hairy goat, has never quite mastered the art of shaving. But always important, first, to say the one big thing. I’ve only loved three men in my life - my Dad was a frosty bugger - so that only leaves dear Uncle D - Nat King Cole, of course - and this young man here. I'd only give one piece of advice to anyone marrying. We're all quite similar in the end, we all get old, we all wrinkle, we all tell the same tales too many times - but try to marry someone... kind. And this is a kind man - with a good heart. I'm not particularly proud of many things in my life - but I'm very proud to be the father of my son. AFTERWARDS, BACK IN THE SWING OF THE PARTY...
46) 33) dialog: I was tempted to - but decided not to. This time. BE A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT KIT KAT AGAIN.
46) 34) dialog: Are you okay, Kit Kat?
52) 8) dialog: Come on, he wasn't that bad.
54) 27) dialog: Speaking of which, where is Kit Kat?
59) 7) dialog: Come on, you two. Tea’s up.
62) 6) dialog: No, I should have mentioned that. The exact sperm at the exact moment - if you do anything the tiniest bit different, different baby. Chances are.
62) 8) dialog: Just like for everyone else.
62) 10) dialog: Problem? INT. TIM AND MARY’S HOUSE. NIGHT. 90 IT’S AFTER THE BABY’S BIRTHDAY PARTY - IN THE DEBRIS OF T ROOM, TIM SITS WITH KIT KAT.
63) 10) dialog: Speaking of which, where is Kit Kat? WE CUT TO TIM - HE GRITS HIS TEETH - AND THEN...
67) 107) dialog: O for God's sake - not you too?
67) 111) dialog: Well, Kit Kat's just rolled up blubbing her eyes out - and now you're here. What's Mum been saying?
67) 113) dialog: Yes, well, apart from that. CUT TO THEM, SITTING IN HIS STUDY - THEY'VE BEEN TALKING.
67) 114) dialog: Don't think I haven't tried. It may have been the smoking but I couldn't undo that, as it was before you were all born - and Mum definitely wouldn't have gone out with me at all if I hadn't been such a sexy smoker. I did get it found as soon as possible - but it was too late.
67) 116) dialog: O, you know, it could be years.
67) 118) dialog: Weeks, I'm afraid.
67) 121) dialog: Yes.
67) 123) dialog: I rather let myself down. Hugged you. AND TIM WALKS TOWARDS HIM - HIS DAD STANDS - HE HUGS HIM. HE EMERGES FROM THE HUG.
67) 125) dialog: I never said we could fix things. I specifically never said that. Life is a mixed bag, no matter who you are. Look at Jesus - he was the son of God, for God’s sake, and his life was still all a terrible old fuck up.
67) 127) dialog: Don’t - in fact feel the opposite - the only people who give up work at 50 are the Time Travellers with cancer who want to play more table tennis with their sons.
67) 129) dialog: Sorry we had to call. It's suddenly got very bad - and Mum and I have been fighting it alone for quite a while.
67) 131) dialog: I have thought of this one thing. If we're very careful. Just do it exactly the same...
69) 5) dialog: So. Tim. My son. Do you want to know the secret - or do you want to find it out for yourself - like I did?
69) 7) dialog: Less dramatic. More important. The big one.
70) 2) dialog: Think about that thing I mentioned. Practice.
70) 4) dialog: Mary. SHE HUGS HIM - HE WHISPERS.
70) 5) dialog: I've left everything to you. Don’t give him a penny.
74) 14) dialog: This bit's very good - can I just read you this bit -
74) 16) dialog: Where have you come from? THERE ARE TEARS IN TIM'S EYES.
74) 17) dialog: Okay - okay. Thanks for coming. How's Uncle D's suit?
74) 19) dialog: Excellent. Mary’s dress?
74) 21) dialog: Perfect. Did I mention I wanted that Stevie Wonder track?
74) 23) dialog: Excellent.
76) 10) dialog: O my God. I won. I haven't won for years!
76) 12) dialog: What's my prize? Apart from the Olympic gold medal, of course? PAUSE. A BIG SMILE FROM TIM.
76) 14) dialog: A kiss? A kiss?
76) 18) dialog: I get you. This is it then?
76) 20) dialog: My son.
76) 23) dialog: Or just one more game - I'd love to beat you twice.
76) 25) dialog: “Who'd have thought it - father and son for the 28th year in the Olympic final - and young Tim suddenly looking like a broken man.”
