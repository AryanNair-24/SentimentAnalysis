15) 16) dialog: What the fuck do you want?
15) 18) dialog: Who?
15) 20) dialog: What about him?
15) 22) dialog: Go in there - and wait. Quietly. I mean it - don't make a fucking sound. 24 INT. HARRY’S HOUSE. DAY. 24
15) 25) dialog: No - it's gone. I was actually having the first good idea I've had for a year, when you rang on the doorbell - and now it’s gone. You little shit.
15) 28) dialog: It's upstairs. The room. How's your Dad? Weird cock I always thought - something weird about him...
15) 30) dialog: Yeah. Never really liked him actually. Your Mum still look like Winston Churchill? That by the way is my wife. (PASSING A PHOTO)
15) 34) dialog: Here we go. Try not to make too much noise - particularly when having sex.
15) 36) dialog: Christ. Two losers in one house.
15) 38) dialog: That's my daughter. Have sex with her if you like. Apparently everyone else has. INT. HARRY'S HOUSE. MORNING. 19. 25
15) 40) dialog: 
20) 4) dialog: First night of my play Thursday - do you want to come?
20) 6) dialog: Really? A girl at last? The sad virgin's rocks finally get offed.
20) 8) dialog: Urgh. Ditch the pervert.
20) 11) dialog: Please yourself. Anyway - the play's total crap - you're better off out of it.
20) 13) dialog: Don’t patronise me. I know shit when I see it. And when I write it.
22) 3) dialog: Nothing - just a flesh wound. You May remember, my play opened tonight.
22) 5) dialog: Well - it went well - very well - you could feel in the room a masterpiece was being unfurled.
22) 8) dialog: Really. Until - and this is the crucial plot point, I think - until the lead actor had the most massive freeze in the history of theatre.
22) 10) dialog: Yes. He didn't just forget his lines. He forgot his lines to an extent that no actor has ever forgotten his lines before in the annals of dramatic art. In the crucial courtroom scene. The reviews won't say “Major Masterpiece Gets Unveiled” - they'll say “Major Actor Gets Alzheimers”.
22) 12) dialog: Is an understatement. It's a catastrophe. It's the Titanic of play openings. No survivors.
22) 14) dialog: What the fuck do you mean ‘what you can do?’ - what you going to ring up every critic and offer them a blow-job if they ignore the fact that we sat in total silence for half an hour waiting for a moron to remember ONE LINE.
22) 19) text: So what's it like, Harry?
22) 20) dialog: Masterpiece, I'm told.
22) 92) dialog: O look - and here's the little prick who walked out half way through. You missed the best scene, you twerp.
23) 2) dialog: Cheer up, mate, apparently you're living with Britain's greatest living playwright. Don't usually read them - but couldn't resist this one. "Harry Chapman found Guilty - of genius.”
46) 9) dialog: When Tim asked me to do his best man speech, my immediate reaction was - “how much are you going to pay me, you little shit? I don’t write for free, you know...” CUT BACK TO THE STRIPPING GAME IN THE FLAT...
46) 44) dialog: No - no! Fuck off. It's a wedding for God's sake. (MORE)
46) 46) dialog: I'm here to celebrate true love - not to hand out stupid bits of paper with my illegible signature on it that you can flog on eBay, so at the next wedding you can afford to buy a less hideous hat.
46) 48) dialog: O God - (TO HER) you might have told me. People should wear name tags.
46) 50) dialog: ‘Sod off’, rather than ‘fuck off’, I suppose.
54) 16) dialog: O shut up. HARRY IS THERE TOO, WITH A VERY SMALL BEAR.
54) 18) dialog: I was tricked. I was told there'd be free booze. Hate kids, as you know. For fuck's sake, Tim - I'm going to need straight vodka if there's a fucking clown coming.
63) 8) dialog: I would have done, I hate the smiley bastards.
74) 7) dialog: Course we’re not. Hateful day.
