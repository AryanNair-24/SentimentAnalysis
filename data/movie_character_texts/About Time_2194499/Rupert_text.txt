25) 16) text: Rupert? A RATHER GROOVY, GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN APPROACHES.
25) 17) dialog: Hi - sorry I'm late - with my Dad - he's very needy with Mum... gone.
25) 20) dialog: How's the exhibition?
25) 22) dialog: Never got it really. Not my type. THIS DOESN'T GO DOWN WELL WITH TIM.
25) 26) dialog: Her, obviously. TIM PULLS A FACE AT THAT. THEN A THOUGHT OCCURS...
25) 28) dialog: Only a week ago actually. It's been a bit of a whirlwind, hasn't it, poochy face? THAT'S EVEN WORSE. BILE GATHERING IN TIM'S THROAT.
25) 30) dialog: "Poochy face' out?
25) 32) dialog: I would never call you '‘fuckbucket'.
25) 35) dialog: Well, okay, it was, what, a week ago - your birthday, Joanna...
25) 37) dialog: And Jo was having a little party.
26) 4) dialog: Yes...
26) 6) dialog: Can I help?
26) 9) dialog: My father?
26) 11) dialog: What kind of trouble?
26) 16) dialog: Why?
26) 18) dialog: I'm sorry - but who are you? - because there is a scenario here where you're a random lunatic.
26) 20) text: Well then let me explain the actual scenario. I'm a plain clothes policeman and I'm doing you a fucking favour because I know how badly these things can affect the kids - so, risking my career, I'm telling you to move your posh arse in the direction of Paddington Police station. You weren't your Dad's one phone call because he called his lawyer because he doesn't want to rot in jail for 50 years - but now he desperately needs a friend - and my sources tell me you may be the only member of the family left, with your mother... gone. But, of course, you could just go get drunk instead, and leave him to suffer - miserably - alone - forever. RUPERT LOOKS AT HIM.
26) 21) dialog: Paddington Police Station?
26) 23) dialog: Where's that?
26) 29) dialog: It's okay. Nothing. I'll be back in an hour. Save me a drink. THAT ‘BACK IN AN HOUR’ WORRIES TIM A BIT.
26) 30) dialog: I suppose I should say ‘thank you’.
26) 32) dialog: Paddington Police Station.
26) 34) dialog: Paddington. Obviously.
