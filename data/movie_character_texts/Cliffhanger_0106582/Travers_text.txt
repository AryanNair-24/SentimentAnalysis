7) 25) dialog: (laughs) There isn't a hell of a lot anyone can do but observe. (beat) This is the most protected shipment we've got -- and the most useless for a thief. Those bills aren't in circulation. You think five thousand dollar bills are easy to pass? Who the fuck would try?

7) 35) dialog: You have my sympathy, but -- (exasperated) There's a reason we do things this way, all right? Armored cars can be hijacked. Trains can be derailed. But nobody can get to us in flight. The only time this is on the ground is at the mint, or on the Presidio runway in San Francisco. Either way, someone would have to shoot his way past a couple of thousand guards.

11) 20) text: Travers puts his hands out and walks forward -- slowly, backing Matheson into the cabin. Not in surrender, but as he's calming a nutcase. The other agents see this and don know which way to jump.

11) 23) dialog: He's losing it --

15) 15) text: Travers opens one of the cases, which is identical to the others -- except that it's full of one dollar bills. He's thought of everything.
15) 16) dialog: We get twenty-one gun funerals and they write off fifty million. It's perfect, as long as you hold the plane steady -- so concentrate.
