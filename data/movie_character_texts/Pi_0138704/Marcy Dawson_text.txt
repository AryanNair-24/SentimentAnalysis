26) 13) dialog: Good. It's funny,  even though we have different  aims and different goals  we're actually incredibly  alike. We both seek the same  thingВ—perfection. I know... clearly we're seeking  different types of  perfection, but that is what  makes us perfect candidates  for a fruitful partnership.  If you let me, I can be your  greatest ally. Take the  acacia tree...in East  Africa. It is the most  prevalent plant in all of  Kenya because it has managed  to secure its niche by  defeating its major predator,  the giraffe. To accomplish  this, the tree has made a contract  with a highly specialized red ant.  The tree has evolved giant spores which  act as housing for the ants  In return for shelter, the  ants supply defense. When a  giraffe starts to eat the  tree's leaves, the shaking  branch acts like an alarm. The  ants charge out and secrete an  acid onto the giraffe's  tongue. The giraffe learns its  lesson and never returns.  Without each other, the tree  would be picked dry and the  ants would have no shade from  the brutal African sun Both  would die. But with each  other, they succeed, they survive,  they surpass. They have  different aims, different  goals but they work together. Max, we would like to establish  a mutually benefiting alliance  with you.
