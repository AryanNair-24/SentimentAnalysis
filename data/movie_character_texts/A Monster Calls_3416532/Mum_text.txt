I was really, really young - only six years older than you, if you can believe it - and this was a time when things werent going so great. Your dad was gone and I wasn“t speaking to your Grandma. And I kept thinking, What if I get this wrong? It“d be the middle of the night and I wouldn“t know what to do, I°d have no one to ask, no one to lean on. And do you know what I'd always do? I’d look into your eyes, into your little baby eyes, and I'd say, “We’re a team, me and you. We’re in this together.” And I’d still be scared, but it didn’t matter so much anymore. Because you were counting on me, and that was the only thing that mattered. (rubs his head) Still is. up, puts an arm around him, her head on his They both look out at the tree.

You know that tree behind our house I’m always prattling on about? Conor freezes, comically. Mum coughs, again ugly, leans b on the bed.
4) 56) dialog: Well, if you can believe it, this drug is actually made from trees like that. ConOR It is? MuM Yeah, I know. All this time, we could have just chopped the damn thing down. (laughs ) Well, not that one. That one’s almost like a friend. Conor's face shows a growing revelation. Could this be th reason? Is it too much to hope for? He looks up at the ro clock. It’s 4.15. Clockface morphs into... 98 158. InT. graNDMA’S guest ROOM - that night 98 ...another, smaller clock on the wall of Grandma’s guest room. Conor watches it with enormous IMPATIENCE.

The new treatment isn’t working, sweetheart. ConOR The one from the yew tree?
4) 127) dialog: Yes. ConOR How can it not be working? Beat, as Mum swallows, tries to smile for him. 202. MuM Things have just moved really fast. Faster than they thought.
4) 129) dialog: I know. I had big hopes for our own personal yew tree. ConOR But it didn’t help. Mum shakes her head slightly. ConOR (CONT'D) So what happens now? What’s the next treatment? Mum doesn’t answer. Which is an answer in itself. Conor l back at the floor and says the final thing out loud. ConOR (CONT'D) There aren’t any more treatments. MuM (quietly crying now) I’m sorry, son. I’ve never been more sorry about anything in my life. ConoR You said it would work. You believed it would work. MuM I know. ConOR You lied. You’ve been lying this whole time.
4) 130) dialog: I think, maybe, deep in your heart, you've always known, though. Haven’t you? She reaches for him, but he won’t take her hand. Mum (CONT'D) It’s okay that you’re angry, sweetheart. It really, really is. (rueful laugh) I’m pretty angry, too, to tell you the truth. But Conor? Are you listening, Conor? 203. Conor, still looking away, eventually nods.
4) 131) dialog: One day, if you look back and you feel bad for being so angry that you couldn’t even speak to me, then you have to know that it was okay. That I knew. I know everything you need to tell me without you having to say it out loud. Conor still can’t look at her. She starts crying harder, pushes through it.
4) 132) dialog: And honestly, son, you be as angry as you need to be. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Not your father, not your grandma, no one. And if you need to break things, then by God, you break them good and hard. And I'll be right there. You might not see me, but I’1l be right there, breaking ‘em right along with you. Conor can hardly bear it.
4) 133) dialog: I need to know that you heard me, sweetheart. I need to know, okay? Okay? Without looking at her, Conor finally nods his agreement. final acknowledgement that she’s going to die. Mum breathes out in exhausted relief. Mum (CONT'D) I’m so sorry. I’m going to have to take some more painkillers. Obviously in pain, she presses the morphine button. She reaches for Conor again. After a beat he finally takes he hand. MuM (CONT'D) (quietly weeping) I wish I had a hundred years. A hundred years I could give to you. Conor holds his mother’s hand and looks at the floor, as drifts to drug-induced sleep. There’s nothing more to say 128 204. InT. hoSPITAL ROOM - later 128 Conor's Mum is asleep. The light outside has grown dimmer Conor sits, alone, in the chair, hunched down low. Grandm enters, a worried look on her face. How did it go? Conor looks up at her, his eyes red, with grief, with rag ConoR I want to go home. GrANDMA Conor- ConOR My home. The one with the yew tree.
5) 19) dialog: The nightmare is in full flow. The screaming, the roaring the wind, all because he’s holding on to his mother, tryi to prevent her from falling. Mum Don’t let go, Conor! Don’t let me go! ConOR (struggling) I won’t! I promise. The wind grows worse; the whirlpool effect starts to pull cars and telephone poles into the hole. Conor’s Mum starts to slip from Conor’s grasp. ConOR (CONT'D) No! Conor turns to our original Monster, still not moving.
5) 22) dialog: 
5) 79) dialog: (eyes still closed) Is he? Grandma looks at Conor, urging him to say something. ConOR I'm here, mum. Eyes still shut, Conor’s Mum reaches out a hand for him t take. Just like he held it on the cliff face. There is movement behind Conor, a familiar shadow appeari Somehow the Monster fits in the room. MonSTER Here is the end of the tale. ConOR (to Monster) What do I do? The Monster puts two hands on Conor’s shoulders, gently pushing him towards his mum’s bed. Conor looks at the clock as he goes. It reads 11.58. Mome before 12.07. 232. ConOR (CONT'D) 12.07. Is that...? (whispering) I'm afraid. MonSTER Of course you are afraid. It will be hard. It will be more than hard. But you will make it through, Conor O'Malley. They reach the bed, where his Mum’s hand is still outstretched. Conor’s eyes begin to water. ConOR (whispering, to Monster) You'll stay? You’ll stay until... MonSTER I will be right here. The moment is here. Conor takes his mother’s hand. She opens her eyes, but she sees him there. Really sees h Does she even see the Monster behind him? Conor can see the light reflected in her eyes, where the “life” is. MonSTER (CONT'D) Now all that is left is for you to speak the simplest truth of all. And, at last, Conor can finally tell her the real truth. ConOR (simply, quietly) I don’t want you to go. Mum (at the end) I know, my love. I know. Conor’s tears begin to spill now, in a quiet way. ConOR (again) I don’t want you to go. And there’s nothing more to say. He leans forward onto he bed, and slips an arm around her, holding on to her. The mother closes her eyes finally.
