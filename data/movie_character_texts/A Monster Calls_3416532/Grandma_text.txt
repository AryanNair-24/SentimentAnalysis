Grandma is helping Mum up the floor, Mum is in serious pain. Mum (gestures to mantel) I need the Oromorph-

Grandma looks up at Conor, her face set and unreadable. 32 65. InT. conor’s sitting room - that evening 32 Grandma sets a meal, heavy on the celery, down in front o Conor and his Mum, who looks much more tired. They eat on trays in the sitting room.

3) 30) dialog: Why is it so bad that I’d like you to take care of yourself?

We can see plenty o get well cards on the shelves, plus tumbles of smart chicklit, his mum’s CD collection (90s rave, Massive Atta Blur), some of her drawings. Conor glances impatiently at the clock display on the DVD player. It clicks over from 12.06 to 12.07. A breeze tousles Conor’s hair. He listens for the Monster And listens. And listens. Nothing. The clock ticks over to 12.08. He sees a pen rol across the top of the DVD player. Other things, including shoe, start rolling towards the kitchen. Conor gets to his feet, blanket wrapped around him. He go into... 35 71. Int. conor’S KITCHEN - conTINUOUS 35 ...the kitchen. The kitchen roll and a cup from the table rolling towards the door outside. It rattles, too.

Inside is entirely taken over by the NIGHTMARE: blackness, roaring and screaming, a horrible deafening no churning the blackness, a voice calling “Conor!” in terro Conor calls out and slams the door. Mum (0.S.) (from Conor’s room) Conor? I’m in here. Conor breathes heavy for a moment. He opens his mum’s doo crack. It’s normal. He closes it and goes to his own bedr 65 110. InT. conor’S BEDROOM - DAY - conTINUOUS 65 His mum, in a TERRIBLE TINA TURNER-ESQUE WIG, lies on his bed, looking out at the yew tree, SKETCHING ON CONOR’S SKETCHPAD. MuM Hi, sweetheart. Come sit. He sits down next to her on the bed. She’s sketching the tree. The drawing is half-finished, but really excellent. Mum (CONT'D) (w/o turning) Yew trees are amazing, you know. Live for thousands of years. And they’re always planted in churchyards because the- ConOR (finishes, heard it a thousand times) -berries are poisonous so they have to be kept away from cows and stuff.
3) 107) dialog: (ignores this, finishes with watch) This is the correct time. Not the one on your computer, or even the one on the news. Right here. I almost got this on Antiques Roadshow once.

GrandMA Pick up your rucksack, please. Don’t want your father to think I’m keeping you in a pigsty. ConOR (muttering) Not much chance of that. His Grandma opens a front closet, puts on a coat. GrandMA Now, Conor, when you go to the hospital, your father may not notice how tired your mum’s been getting, okay? So we’re going to have to make sure he doesn’t overstay his welcome. Final check in the mirror. GranDMA (CONT'D) (to herself) Not that that’s historically been a problem. She gives one last appraising look at Conor. Grandma (CONT'D) If you get hungry before your dad gets here, there’s steamed broccoli in the fridge. No eggs. You’ve already had eggs twice this week. (frowns, sighs) Be good. And lets herself out. 68 116. InT. granDMA’S Kitchen - moments LATER Montage as Conor looks around his Grandma’s house for something to do.

He takes off his coat, but ends up fighting with the slee He stands, getting frustrated, eventually throwing the co to the floor. He stands there, breathing, on the verge of letting all his bottled up anger go. Almost absentmindedly, he kicks his rucksack (set against settee). It spills open, dumping his sketchpad, which ope at a drawing of the swallowing hole and the face looking back. Enraged, he tears the picture out and rips it in tw throwing the pieces into the sitting room. He’s still angry, and it’s growing, not abating. It feels strangely good. He flexes his fists, anger still fizzing. Suddenly, BONG! BONG! The precious CLOCK starts striking 9 o'clock hour. Conor approaches it. It chimes away, the pendulum swingin Still edgy, Conor grabs it mid-swing. The bongs continue, the clock makes a groaning sound. Holding the pendulum in place, Conor starts pushing the d of the clock around. They resist at first, but he pushes harder and faster, until they’re spinning around the face The BONGs groan alarmingly as he passes each hour, but he keeps going, faster and faster, until- SNAP! The second hand breaks in two in his grip. Oh, no. Conor comes to his senses, realises what he’s don The clock is broken, really broken, frozen in place. He’s doomed, and so horrified he doesn’t register that th now non-moving hands have stopped at 12.07. MonSTER (0.S.) As destruction goes, this is remarkably pitiful. Conor turns and sees that somehow, impossibly, the Monste in his Grandma’s sitting room. It fills up all available space, folding its massive form into every corner, its he bumping the ceiling. Conor looks back at the clock, frantic now.

LILY’S NOTE takes it out and unfolds a comically high number of times It’s just three lines: --“I miss being your friend.” --"You’re not invisible.” --“I see you.” The “I” is underlined a comic number of times, too.

Drawings cover the walls, there are shelves of SKETCHPADS in rows, and at the far end, a DESK just like the one in Conor’s room. On it is Conor’s torn drawing of the nightmare from the sitting room. Conor approaches it and picks it up. Underneath is a SKETCHPAD, an old one. There’s a note on top from his Grandma. “This belonged to your mum.” On the cover are the words “Lizzie’S SKETCHPAD, AGE 12 (a half).” Conor opens it. We recognise his mum's style of art.
