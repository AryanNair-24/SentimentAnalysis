MR CLARK, 40s, wry, kind, perhaps a bi soft, steps up next to it. Mr Clark Brace yourselves. Conor sits at the back, an empty desk next to him. He loo very drowsy. MR Clark (CONT'D) We've been studying this all week. You've seen the diagrams, heard the descriptions. You think you’re ready to watch the real thing. He gives a you-have-no-idea-what-you’re-in-for chuckle an clicks to start a hilariously graphic CHILDBIRTH DOCUMENT on the Powerpoint. The sounds from the documentary ("The cervix fully dilate 10 centimeters and the baby's head crowns when the widest part of it reaches the vaginal opening”, complete with so of a mother in labour) fade as we focus on Conor, looking exhausted, falling asleep propping up his face with his h He’s sitting under the A/C vent and the sound of it start merge with a WIND sound, that eventually rises to the SOUNDTRACK of the NIGHTMARE we heard over the TITLES.

She sits next to Conor in the empty desk. He doesn’t acknowle her, despite her furious gaze. Wounded, she looks up at the video and is comically horri by what she sees. Mr Clark reaches the front of the classroom as the sounds childbirth reach their exhausted conclusion (“And mother’ happy ordeal is finally over...”).
