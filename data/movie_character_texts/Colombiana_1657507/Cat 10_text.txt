151) 17) dialog: I want you exactly where you are.
151) 26) dialog: You know the thing about sharks. You can swim with them all day and they will just ignore you, but put one drop of blood in the water and they become your biggest admirers.
151) 30) dialog: I'm not going to kill you.
160) 3) dialog: I brought you something.

160) 66) dialog: Now me what?
160) 70) dialog: OK. Want to fuck?
160) 76) dialog: Like what?
160) 80) dialog: That's a hard one for me.
160) 89) dialog: I'm lonely sometimes.
160) 94) dialog: Isn't that enough?
163) 14) dialog: I shouldn't have done this.
163) 19) dialog: Any of it.
163) 23) dialog: Because.

166) 3) dialog: Sorry I'm late.
166) 16) dialog: So what?
166) 20) dialog: Tio. Could be anyone. You're seeing things that aren't there.
166) 24) dialog: How many people did you kill in revenge for your boy's death? How many? And you're going to give me a lecture about revenge?
166) 36) dialog: 
171) 5) dialog: No Mama. One thing at a time.
174) 18) dialog: 
178) 7) dialog: It's me. 90.

181) 7) dialog: So we're seeing the same sky.
181) 14) dialog: And I'm happy to hear yours.
181) 25) dialog: ...What picture?
181) 30) dialog: 
181) 42) dialog: 
181) 48) dialog: Who else? 92.
181) 52) dialog: 
181) 61) dialog: Closer. I know. Goodbye Danny.
225) 7) dialog: I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry 98.
227) 3) dialog: I'd like to speak to the agent in charge of the TAG killings.
233) 3) dialog: This won't take long. Hands up.
233) 6) dialog: Turn around.
233) 9) dialog: Sit.
233) 15) dialog: You mean these?
233) 18) dialog: Talking about covering all your bases. Your chair is pressure wired. You move your ass one inch you don't have one anymore.
233) 21) dialog: I know what you're thinking. Maybe yes a bluff, maybe no. But you have to figure yes, given what you know about me.
233) 24) dialog: This wasn't what I had in mind for myself when I was a kid. I wanted to be on the other side of things. Like you.
233) 28) dialog: He did.
233) 31) dialog: This is the last time I was happy.
233) 35) dialog: The next day they were dead. He killed them.
233) 39) dialog: I didn't know how else to find him.
233) 43) dialog: It took you a long time.
233) 47) dialog: What else do I have to be? I have no one. I did. Until this morning. I had them.
233) 52) dialog: And now I want to finish it.
233) 56) dialog: Yes you can. He's protected by your government.
233) 60) dialog: You're going to have to try harder.
233) 63) dialog: I found this on your table inside. Your family, right?
233) 66) dialog: Brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews. Mother, father. Nice.
233) 69) dialog: I know this sounds harsh. But until I get what I want, you'll go to a funeral a week. And you will begin to feel what I have felt all these years.
233) 78) dialog: When your dinner's ready, the timer on it will have expired. Then you can get to work.
236) 3) dialog: You guys ever been to New Orleans?
240) 3) dialog: Good morning. 105.
240) 6) dialog: I didn't know if you took sugar and cream, so I got one of each.
