139) 29) dialog: The paper says twenty two. All like this. Tell me why.

139) 38) dialog: It's not just you in this. It's me, Mama. 63.
139) 42) dialog: I watch your ass. Each and every job, I vet, I double vet. For every one I book you, I turn down five, ten. I promised to keep you safe. I KEEP YOU SAFE. Cataleya. It's a full time job, no matter what you think. Those pictures...they freaked me out. OK? I didn't realize...
