112) 5) dialog: Where is he?
112) 9) dialog: Let's go.
115) 3) dialog: Same handwriting. Same flower. It's him. Let's see the location.
117) 5) dialog: No comment.
117) 8) dialog: You didn't lock it down?
117) 13) dialog: Do it. Now. No one in or out.
118) 3) dialog: I want to see paper on everyone in and out of the station in the last twenty four hours.
118) 6) dialog: And I want the tapes from the security cameras.
124) 3) dialog: He tilted the camera just enough so the angle would catch the guard, not who was holding him.
124) 6) dialog: Twenty two murders in four years all with the same M.O. The word, the flower. He's sending a message, for sure. And I'm beginning to think it's not to us.
124) 10) dialog: And we're not getting anywhere with it, are we?
124) 13) dialog: If the message is not for us, let's make sure the one it's intended for gets it. I want you to put it out to the press. Splash it across every newspaper, every magazine. National. I want eyeballs on it coast to coast. Monitor it. Let's see if anything comes back. 53.
133) 3) dialog: Rizzo here...
133) 6) dialog: The most recent, was done to keep him from talking. Alexa Milshinova...

133) 12) dialog: ...tried to take over the heroin trade in Houston from...
133) 15) dialog: The Gemini cartel. Their crimes are self explanatory, if you can read. Now I know some of you are thinking whoever is doing this makes less work for mother. And since there's no collateral damage, why are we wasting valuable manpower and resources on the case? And since until now, there has never been a clue to go on, why go on? But with this last killing...
133) 18) dialog: We have one. As we go to the video tape.
133) 21) dialog: We can't see the assassin, but we can see...
133) 24) dialog: The time. 2 AM. Which means our perp was in the station at...I don't have to spell it out for you.
133) 27) dialog: These are the names, phone numbers and addresses of everyone with a pulse who entered that police station before two AM. Cops, criminals, clerks, janitors. Everyone. One of them is our target. I want each of you to locate the ten people in the folder you've been given. I want a complete dossier on every one of them for the last ten years of their lives. Run down every lead. Check out every story. Our killer is out there. And we're going to find him. Before he kills again.
140) 3) dialog: OK. Let's try...organization...
140) 7) dialog: 
152) 13) dialog: FBI special agent Jack Ross. I'm lead agent on a case. A serial killer we call the tag killer.
152) 20) dialog: Marks his victims with a flower. From Colombia. A Cataleya orchid.
152) 24) dialog: When I try to access information, I get stuck with a CIA Access denied folder. I understand you were the station chief down there when this rash of murders with the same MO...
152) 29) dialog: 
152) 32) dialog: Thank you.
156) 3) dialog: Where are we?
156) 10) dialog: 
156) 15) dialog: Let's see her booking report.
156) 20) dialog: But not to get prints.
156) 24) dialog: Lovely. So if there is no booking record, how did we get the name?
156) 28) dialog: I don't believe this.
156) 34) dialog: 
156) 38) dialog: That's it?
156) 43) dialog: It's not a lot to go on. But put them in the data base and let's see what matches.
156) 46) dialog: ...a woman.
169) 4) dialog: 
181) 19) dialog: We got her! I want SWAT there! All of them! Now! 91.
206) 3) dialog: She's not here. Lock the building down!
208) 3) dialog: Where the hell did she go?
211) 3) dialog: No one in or out! Lock this place down! Anyone?
218) 4) dialog: Where?
218) 8) dialog: (into walkie talkie) All units! Converge on the garage. Cover every exit!
220) 11) dialog: 
228) 3) dialog: Agent Ross. Hello? Hello?
233) 12) dialog: Just so you know, all this? Being so smart? Covering all your bases? It's not going to matter. It's already over. The whole place is wired with web cams.
233) 26) dialog: So what happened?
233) 37) dialog: And all this? All these clues...they weren't for us. They were for him.
233) 41) dialog: And you figured sooner or later we would make this public.
233) 45) dialog: You're very patient.
233) 50) dialog: You sent him a message. He sent you one back.
233) 54) dialog: I can't help you.
233) 58) dialog: By a part of the government I have no way of reaching. It's CIA. I don't know why. But there's no getting through it, under it, around it, believe me, I've tried.
233) 72) dialog: Wait...
233) 75) dialog: What about...?
235) 10) dialog: Can't or won't.
235) 14) dialog: Look, let's put all our cards on the table here. I've met this woman. The killer.
235) 19) dialog: My apartment. She trapped me. She told me if I did not get her this man.
235) 22) dialog: She will kill a member of my family every day until I have none.
235) 27) dialog: Do I look like I could make something like that up?
235) 30) dialog: So? What should I do now?
235) 35) dialog: Ross.
235) 39) dialog: She says you either give her what she wants or she is going to redecorate your office.
235) 42) dialog: Bright red.
235) 47) dialog: She says she's using seven point six two steel jacketed armor piercing shells. And you have ten seconds to give her the address.
235) 52) dialog: You can't. But I can assure you that if you don't give her the address you will be number twenty four on her hit parade. Trust me on this one.
235) 58) dialog: She asked you to keep this conversation strictly confidential.
235) 64) dialog: Thank you. Because honestly I didn't know how I was going to explain you splattered all over your walls.
268) 3) dialog: Was there anything else?
268) 7) dialog: We don't really have anything to charge you with.
268) 11) dialog: Just a few more questions.
268) 15) dialog: Sure.
270) 9) dialog: Cataleya? Cataleya!
