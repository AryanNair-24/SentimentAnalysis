158) 8) dialog: 
158) 12) dialog: Here. For you.
158) 17) dialog: First for fucking up your shot. Second, for an address. You remember Fabio? The Cataleya Killer?
158) 21) dialog: You went to school with his brother in law. What was his name? Emilio?
158) 26) dialog: I have a problem. And we think Fabio's kid is behind it.

240) 19) dialog: You will take up positions here...
243) 3) dialog: And here. And here. You must expect the unexpected. She is like mist under a door, like a mouse in the wall. She will never attack straight on. You will not see her, until it is too late. She is that invisible.
243) 6) dialog: We would prefer she be taken alive. But with a bitch like this, if you get a kill shot you take it.
243) 15) dialog: 
243) 24) dialog: You four! Get the armored Mercedes! We have to get Don Luis out of here!
243) 27) dialog: Don Luis! This way! Everyone to their positions!
245) 23) dialog: Don Luis! You hide here.
245) 26) dialog: Wait for my call. Either she is dead, or we have her far enough away so you can make it to the garage. Take the van. The armor is so thick nothing short of an atomic bomb can penetrate it.
245) 30) dialog: 
245) 35) dialog: Thank you.
247) 10) dialog: Down!
247) 16) dialog: Go! 109.

248) 3) dialog: Kill her!
250) 3) dialog: 
250) 7) dialog: 
252) 2) dialog: 
252) 6) dialog: You know what bitch? I loved killing your father. He was a coward! And you know what else? I screwed your mother behind your father's back! We all did! She couldn't get enough of it! The whore! I killed her! I killed him! You want to avenge them? The whore and the coward? That's what you come from! Come out! I'm here! Come get the bullet with your name on it, Bitch!
252) 9) dialog: Kill her!
253) 3) dialog: You two here! That door opens...
