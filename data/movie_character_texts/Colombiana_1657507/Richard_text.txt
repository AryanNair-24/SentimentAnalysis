127) 19) dialog: Coincidence? Twenty two times? A flower that only grows in one place on earth? That used to be the calling card of...what was his name? Your former partner? The one who did your wet work?
127) 23) dialog: Because when we find the end of a string we like to know where it begins.
127) 27) dialog: Don Luis. Let's cut to the chase here, OK? When the Agency extracted your ass from Colombia fifteen years ago, and set you up here, we let you resume your business when what we should have done was lock you up for life.

235) 25) dialog: You're kidding me?
235) 32) dialog: I'd go to the police. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting...
