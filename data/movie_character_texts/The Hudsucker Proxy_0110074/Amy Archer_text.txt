6) 9) dialog: I don't know what came over me. I  suppose it was the shock of eating  after so long without; the enzymes  kicking in after so long, or whatever.  But then you couldn't possibly know  what it is to be tired and hungry...

6) 34) dialog: A little naive perhaps but -- thank  you -- armed with determination, a  solid work ethic, and an indomitable  belief in the future --
6) 37) dialog: Only to have that belief, that  unsullied optimism, dashed against  the marble and mortar of the modern  work place --

6) 116) text: Still typing, Amy whistles and nods to her shoulder. Smitty tucks the phone into it as she continues typing.
6) 117) dialog: Hiya, Chief, just the person I wanted  to apologize to...
6) 120) dialog: (still typing) Yeah, I was all wet about your idea  man... Well, thanks for being so  generous... It is human, and you are  divine... No, he's no faker. He's  the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy  is a real moron --
6) 122) dialog: -- as in a five-letter word for  imbecile --
6) 124) dialog: -- as pure a specimen as I've ever  run across... Am I sure he's a nitwit?  Heck, if working at the Argus doesn't  make me an expert then my name isn't  Amy Archer and I've never won the  Pulitzer Prize...

6) 164) dialog: Well, I... didn't bother to read the  article. I didn't think the picture  did you justice.
6) 166) dialog: -- or lack thereof?

6) 179) dialog: ...Why don't I just type this up...
6) 181) dialog: Well, I don't know; maybe she does  deserve it. Maybe she should've come  in to face you man to man.
6) 183) dialog: Sure, but -- she could still have  gotten your side for the record!
6) 187) text: Amy turns at the door.
6) 188) dialog: Confused?
6) 190) dialog: (through clenched  teeth) I'm quite sure I don't know what you  mean.
6) 192) dialog: Oh, is that it!
6) 194) dialog: Smitty.
6) 196) dialog: Maybe she puts her work ahead of her  personal appearance.
6) 198) text: Whap! Amy slaps him. He stares.
6) 201) dialog: Norville Barnes, you don't know a  thing about that woman! You don't  know who she really is! And only a  numbskull thinks he knows things  about things he knows nothing about!

There is no window, but on what would be the windo wall there is an enormous iron ring with a metal rod swee an interior circle. It is the backside of the great Hudsu clock. Amy gazes about. She crosses to a door opposite the one s entered from. She stoops to peek through its keyhole.
9) 5) dialog: Huh?!
9) 7) dialog: Who are you? How did you know who I  am?
9) 9) dialog: But -- who are you -- what d'you do  here?
9) 11) dialog: Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone  about me, will you?
9) 13) dialog: So if you know everything about  Hudsucker, tell me why the Board  decided to make Norville Barnes  president.
9) 15) dialog: That smart?!

11) 16) dialog: ...You do?
11) 18) dialog: I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your...  intentions --
11) 20) dialog: Norville, you can't trust people  here like you did in Muncie...

11) 28) dialog: Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well  no, I -- I never really... There's a  place I go now, the cutest little  place near my apartment in Greenwich  Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's  a beatnik bar.
11) 30) dialog: Yes, you can get carrot juice or  Italian coffee, and the people there --  well, none of them quite fit in.  You'd love it -- why don't you come  there with me -- they're having a  marathon poetry reading on New Year's  Eve. I go every year.
11) 32) dialog: Well -- this year -- if it's good I  plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my  it certainly is beautiful --
11) 34) dialog: ...The people look like ants.
11) 36) dialog: What a beautiful thought.
11) 38) dialog: Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a  fast-talking career gal who thought  she was one of the boys --
11) 40) dialog: Norville, there really is something  I have to tell you --
11) 42) dialog: I wish it were that simple, Norville.  I wish I was still a gazelle, and  you were an antelope or an ibex.
11) 45) dialog: Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.

16) 79) dialog: For Pete's sake, Norville!
16) 81) dialog: Never mind about that...
16) 83) dialog: ...You know what those nincompoops  in the boardroom are doing?
16) 85) dialog: They're going to discharge eight  percent of the work force here at  Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone  that means eighteen hundred people  out of work, people with wives and  children and families --
16) 87) dialog: You mean you know about this?
16) 89) dialog: Your i --
16) 91) dialog: You're awful kind to yourself,  Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've  slowed down, sitting up here like a  sultan, not doing a lick of work!  Why you know it's ideas that are the  lifeblood of industry and you haven't  come up with one since the hoop and  the reason's plain to see! You've  forgotten what made your ideas  exciting for you in the first place --  it wasn't for the fame and the wealth  and the mindless adulation of --  would you get out of here?!
16) 93) dialog: ...I've been watching you, Norville  Barnes, even though you've been trying  to avoid me --
16) 95) dialog: Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't  noticed how you've changed. I used  to think you were a swell guy --  well, to be honest I thought you  were an imbecile --
16) 97) dialog: Shutup! -- but then I figured out  you were a swell guy, a little slow  maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe  you're not so slow, but you're not  so swell either and it looks like  you're an imbecile after --
16) 99) dialog: Shutup! -- after all! You haven't  talked to me for a week and now I'm  going to say my piece. I've got a  prediction for you, Norville Barnes:  I predict that since you've decided  to dedicate yourself to greed and  sloth and everything bad, you're  going to lose all the good things  that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away  chasing after money and ease and the  respect of a Board that wouldn't  give you the time of day if you...  if you...
16) 103) dialog: (to the Goon) Shutup! (to Norville) Exactly! Don't you remember how you  used to feel about the hoop? You  told me you were gonna bring a smile  to the hips of everyone in America,  regardless of race, creed or color.  Finally there'd be a thingamajig  that would bring everyone together --  even if it kept 'em apart, spacially --  you know, for kids? Your words,  Norville, not mine. I used to love  Norville Barnes -- yes, love him! --  when he was just a swell kid with  hot ideas who was in over his head,  but now your head is too big to be  in over!
16) 105) dialog: Consider this my resignation --
16) 108) text: Crack -- Amy kicks him hard in the shin.
16) 110) dialog: -- Effective immediately!!
16) 117) text: Aloysious nods wordlessly and turns to leave. As we TRACK IN ON the picture of Amy, we:

16) 200) dialog: But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville  showed me his design for the whatsit  the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't  have invented it -- look at the man --  he's an imbecile!
16) 202) dialog: Says who?!
16) 205) dialog: Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are  Sidney J. Mussburger!
16) 207) dialog: Muncie!
16) 209) dialog: You're fools, both of you! It's  obvious they're out to crucify  Norville! They're trying to destroy  him!
16) 212) dialog: You want slack, I'll give you slack.  You're not putting me out to pasture,  Al, I quit! Consider this my  resignation --
16) 214) dialog: -- effective immediately!
16) 217) text: Amy swings her free arm to -- thwack -- blindside his oth cheek.
17) 16) dialog: Norville!

17) 20) dialog: Oh Norville, I --
17) 23) dialog: Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to  tell you... so many times... It's  hard to admit when you've been wrong.  If you could just... find it in your  heart to -- to give me another chance --
17) 25) dialog: Just give me another chance, Norville --  I can help you fight this thing. I  know this last story was a lie! We  can prove it! We can --
17) 27) dialog: Well that just about does it! I've  seen Norville Barnes, the young man  in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville  Barnes the self-important heel, but  I've never seen Norville Barnes the  quitter, and I don't like it!
17) 29) dialog: ...Fight on, fight on, dear old  Muncie.
17) 31) dialog: ...Fight on, hoist the gold and blue;  You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin' Once 'The Munce' is done with you!  Goooooo Eagles!
17) 34) text: He lurches off his stool toward the door. Watching him,  despair fights with confusion on Amy's face.
