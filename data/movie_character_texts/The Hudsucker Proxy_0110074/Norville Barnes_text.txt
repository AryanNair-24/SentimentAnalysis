I  call you 'Miss' because you seem to  have 'missed' the boat completely on  this one! How on earth would you  know whether I'm an imbecile when  you don't even have the guts to come  in here and interview me man to man!  No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No,  make it 'common decency.' These wild  speculations about my intelligence --
6) 167) dialog: (nodding) -- these preposterous inventions,  would be better suited to the pages  of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the  editors of the Manhattan Argus see  fit to publish the rantings of a  disordered mind, perhaps they will  see fit to publish this letter! But  I doubt it. I most seriously doubt  it. As I doubt also that you could  find a home at Amazing Tales, a  periodical which I have enjoyed for  many years. Yours sincerely, et  cetera.

6) 180) dialog: Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be  necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's  just doing her job, I guess.
6) 182) dialog: Well, she probably had a deadline...
6) 184) dialog: Well, it's done now -- what's the  use of grousing about it. Forget the  letter, Amy, I just had to blow off  some steam...
6) 185) text: She gets up to leave, and is heading for the door when  Norville adds:
6) 186) dialog: ...She's probably just a little  confused.

6) 191) dialog: Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of  these complexes they have nowadays.  Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it?  She's probably very unattractive and  bitter about it.
6) 193) dialog: Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in  men's clothing, swaps drinks with  the guys at the local watering hole,  and hobnobs with some smooth talking  heel in the newsroom named Biff or  Smoocher or...
6) 195) dialog: Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't  they print her picture next to her  byline?
6) 197) dialog: I bet that's exactly what she tells  herself! But you and I both know  she's just a dried-up bitter old  maid. Say, how about you and I grab  a little dinner and a show after  work? I was thinking maybe The King  and I --

10) 57) text: Thump! Dabbing at his brow, Norville has walked square in the back of a debonaire man holding a martini. The drink sloshes and the man turns testily to face him.
10) 59) text: Norville nervously pumps Findlandsen's hand.
10) 60) dialog: Hello, Mr. Finlandsen, so sorry to  meet you -- uh, happy to walk into y --  uh, pleased to make your --
10) 61) text: Findlandsen raises his hand to look quizzically at Norvil handkerchief which he now holds himself, apparently havin been given it during the handshake. He hands it back to Norville.
10) 62) dialog: Thank you, sir...
10) 64) dialog: ...I understand your concern about  the down-ward, you know, but I think  you'll find under our strong new  leadership...
10) 65) text: As Norville's hand drops from his breast pocket the  handkerchief, perhaps caught on his sleeve, whips out of pocket and follows his hand down. Findlandsen looks down and Norville follows his look, and stoops BELOW FRAME to retrieve the hanky. Findlandsen leans quizzically forward and peers down at  Norville, who continues, O.S.
10) 66) dialog: We anticipate, in short order, an  upward...
10) 67) text: In rapid fire, Norville straightens up into -- crunch --  Findlandsen, whose head snaps back, eyes rolling, a hand  pressed to his nose, drink sloshing; Norville, one hand  pressed to the back of his own head and the other wildly  waving his hanky for balance, takes a staggering step for onto the toe of an elegantly-gowned MRS. FINDLANDSEN.
11) 3) text: He turns and we see that it is indeed Norville, holding a dripping icepack against one eye.
11) 5) dialog: Oh. Nothing, really, just... the  more timid investors are no longer  running for cover.
11) 8) dialog: Sid found me the icepack.
11) 10) dialog: Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot  over this imbecile story.
11) 12) dialog: Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been  standing by me through all this.
11) 15) dialog: I know that, Amy.
11) 17) dialog: I understand that you're not very  skilled yet in the secretarial arts.  I'm not that skilled as president.  Oh sure, I put up a big front -- (massages his eye) -- not that everyone's buying it.
11) 19) dialog: Oh, I don't blame them, really. I  guess I have sort of made a mess of  things. These folks have to protect  their investment. Most of them are  very nice people --

11) 37) dialog: What do you think you were in your  previous life, Amy?
11) 39) dialog: Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so  but I find that very farfetched.
11) 41) dialog: That kind of person would come back  as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I  think it more likely that you were a  gazelle, with long, graceful legs,  gamboling through the underbrush.  Perhaps we met once, a chance  encounter in a forest glade. I must  have been an antelope or an ibex.  What times we must have had --  foraging together for sustenance,  picking the grubs and burrs from one  another's coats. Or perhaps we simply  touched our horns briefly and went  our separate ways...
11) 43) dialog: Well, can I at least call you deer?  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the  whole thing is what your beatnik  friends call 'karma' -- the great  circle of life, death and rebirth.
11) 46) dialog: That's it. A great wheel that gives  us each what we deserve...
11) 48) dialog: ...Tomorrow's my big presentation to  the board. I've gotta show Sidney  and the guys that I deserve all their  confidence!

12) 3) dialog: ...I had the boys down at R &amp; D throw  together this prototype so that our  discussion here could have some  focus...
12) 5) dialog: ...and to give you gentlemen of the  Board a first-hand look at just how  exciting this gizmo is...
12) 7) dialog: ...It's fun, it's healthy, it's good  exercise; kids'll just love it, and  we put a little sand inside to make  the whole experience more pleasant.  And the great part is we won't have  to charge an arm and a leg!
12) 29) dialog: You know, for kids! It's... it's ...  well, it's...

15) 33) text: Norville is holding one hand up to shield his eyes from t unaccustomed light. Amy stands next to him, beaming.
15) 34) dialog: Well, it was no great idea, really.  A thing like this, it takes a whole  company to put it together, and I'm  just grateful for the opportunity --
15) 36) dialog: Well, frankly, I don't think anybody  expected this much hoopla --
15) 39) dialog: Well sure, I guess --
15) 41) dialog: Ha-ha-ha-ha. Come on, guys...
16) 0) text: The mean laugh. Norville, behind his desk in LONG SHOT,  laughing, as we begin to TRACK IN. There is something  disconcerting about his laugh -- it is harder, more  businesslike, colder than the dopey laugh that accompanie his elevation to the presidency. Or perhaps it is only ou imagination, for while still some distance away from him: Flash bulb explosion effects a...
16) 4) dialog: Well, I guess so -- I don't think  they promoted me because they thought  I was a jerk.
16) 6) dialog: Jeez, I don't know. An idea like  this sweet baby doesn't just come  overnight...
16) 8) dialog: -- Although I'll tell you one thing:  I certainly didn't expect all this  'hoopla'!
16) 9) text: This TIRED old joke brings some polite laughter. Norville is smiling as he enters the elevator. As its doo start to close, leaving Amy behind:

16) 25) text: A burning cigar emerges from the lather around Norville's face. It waggles as he talks.
16) 26) dialog: There's no truth to the rumors; we're  just dear friends...
16) 28) dialog: ...Isn't that right, Za-Za?
16) 35) text: The barber is periodically pinching Norville's nose to sh under it; as he alternately pinches and releases, Norvill voice breaks from nasal to normal and back.
16) 36) dialog: Not at all. Why, just this week I  came up with several new sweet ideas.  A larger model hula hoop for the  portly. A battery option for the  lazy and handicapped. A model with  more sand for hard-of-hearing. I'm  earning my keep.
16) 38) dialog: Well, by anyone's account I've saved  Hudsucker Industries; our stock is  worth more than it's ever been. So,  yes, I expect to be compensated for  that.
16) 40) text: The mean laugh. FURTHER TRACK IN ON Norville ENDS in CLOS SHOT, his hands clasped on the desktop in front of him, a he finishes his hard, square-jawed, man-on-top laugh, gaz flintily INTO the CAMERA.

16) 88) dialog: Know about it? You think the Board  would do anything like this without  my authorization? No, this was my  idea from the start.

16) 142) dialog: Wait a minute!
16) 144) dialog: ...Why, this is worthless.

16) 147) dialog: This is the most idiotic thing I've  ever seen in my life!
16) 149) dialog: Nobody wants a hare-brained product  like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks  the creative spark, the unalloyed  genius that made, uh...
16) 151) dialog: ...say, the hula hoop such a success.
16) 153) dialog: And what do you mean barging in here  and taking up my valuable time! I've  got a company to run here --

16) 168) dialog: We don't crawl at Hudsucker  Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker  room!
16) 171) dialog: Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
16) 172) text: As we TRACK IN ON Norville, laughing, there is a low,  unearthly RUMBLE, and his face seems to DISSOLVE INTO:

20) 17) dialog: -- No, please!
20) 21) dialog: Falling.
20) 24) dialog: Falling, turning lazily in the air -- and suddenly, with great moaning sound -- he stops, suspended in mid-air, he down, feet in the air. It is much like the freeze frame on Waring Hudsucker that the title of the film was supered over. He waves his arms, to no effect, looks around.
20) 28) dialog: He alone can move, but doesn't fall. He looks awkwardly a his body in a dive-bomber attitude, canted steeply down.

21) 42) dialog: 'Many years, uh... I know that you  will be wondering why I have decided  to move on, ending my tenure at  Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You  will be thinking, Why now, when things  are going so well? Granted, from the  standpoint of our balance sheet and  financials, sure, sure, we're doing  fine. However, Sid. These things  have long since ceased to give me  pleasure. I look at myself now and  no longer see the idealistic young  man who started this company. Now I  see only an empty shell whom others  call a 'success.' How has this come  to pass? When and why did I trade  all of my hopes, dreams and  aspirations, for the emptiness of  power and wealth? What the heck have  I done?
21) 43) text: As Norville reads Hudsucker casually examines his fingern then pats down a yawn.
21) 44) dialog: '...Looking back now, Sid, I see  that I allowed time and age to corrupt  my dreams. Instead of fiercely  guarding what was timeless inside of  myself, I let the hubbub of earthly  commerce erode my character, and  dissolve my better self. How is it  that some manage to preserve  themselves where I have failed?  Sidney, I do not know. Perhaps if  others love you, you may more securely  love yourself -- but I am alone. I  loved a woman once, Sid, as you well  know -- a beautiful, vibrant lady,  an angel who in her wisdom saw fit  to choose you instead of I...'
21) 45) text: Norville is interrupted by loud blubbering. He looks up. Hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief. He saws at his nose, gives it a loud honk, and urgently  quavers in a voice strangled with emotion:
21) 49) text: Norville looks down the page.
21) 50) dialog: '...And so, Sid, the future does not  belong to such as I -- nor even you.  We have made our compromises with  time. The future belongs to the young,  who may more energetically wage the  battle against corruption.  Accordingly, in the spirit of hope,  and the ringing in of the new, I  hereby bequeath my entire interest  in the company, and my seat on the  board, to whomever is Hudsucker's  most recent employee at the time of  my demise. I know this will disappoint  you -- you, Sid, who have served so  diligently and for so long. But --'
21) 56) dialog: '...But Sid, let me urge you to work  closely with the new president, and  to keep giving Hudsucker Industries  all your energies -- but not your  soul. For while we must strive for  success, we must not worship it.  Long live the Hud. Waring  Hudsucker...'
