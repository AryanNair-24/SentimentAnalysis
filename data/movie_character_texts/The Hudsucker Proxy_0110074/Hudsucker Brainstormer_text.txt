He rises to his feet, slowly and  deliberately, and rubs his palms together. He swings his chair out. He steps up onto the chair. The board stares. He steps up from the chair onto the board table. The heads of the board members swing up in unison. Hudsucker is FRAMED FROM MID-TORSO DOWN. He shakes the te loose from each leg, then waggles both arms dangling at h sides, like an athlete preparing for a sprint.

The woman's SCREAM on the street below is FAINT, ECHOING, MIXING INTO the sound of an APPROACHING SIREN. THROUGH the window we see the BOARD MEMBERS still sitting around the table, paralyzed in attitudes of horror and  disbelief. All stare at the shattered window in the f.g. At the far end of the table, Hudsucker's chair is empty a oddly askew. His cigar still smokes in its ashtray. There are dust footprints down the middle of the long oak table. One Executive sits with a pluming cigarette held halfway his mouth; another holds a carafe suspended on its way to his water glass; another holds his spectacles inches from his nose. We hear only the HUM of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK. SID MUSSBURGER ENTERS FRAME at the window. He is a tall m aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and a  commanding presence. He knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his  knuckle, looks out, grunts, and draws his head back in. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him INTO the room. The other board mem heads swivel to watch him, all staring, searching despera for some hint as to the fate of their fallen leader.  Apparently, some absurd hope still lingers. Mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair. He reaches over to pluck the smoking cigar from the suici ashtray.

With a razor blade he is scraping off th name "WARING HUDSUCKER."

A telephone co snakes around to the man sitting in the chair, hidden fro us. On the desktop is a perpetual motion machine of large swinging ball bearings. Click-click-click. A TICKERTAPE MACHINE occasionally BURPS information in th far corner of the office. A huge MECHANICAL ARM -- the sweep second hand of the  Hudsucker clock on the facade of the building -- RUMBLES immediately outside the window, describing an arc that th a moving shadow across the office.
