10) 1) dialog: I can't print this!
10) 3) dialog: It's pure speculation! Why, they'd  have my butt in a satchel!
10) 6) dialog: You don't know anything! Fact is  they haven't bought it! The stock is  cheap, Archer! What're they waiting  for?
10) 9) dialog: You don't accuse someone of stock  manipulation on a hunch, Ignatz! The readers of the Manhattan Argus  aren't interested in sensationalism,  gossip and unsupported speculation.  Facts, figures -- those are the tools  of the newspaper trade! Why it's  almost as if you're trying to take  the heat off this Barnes numbskull --  like you've gone all soft on him!

16) 204) dialog: Smith has a source on the Hud board --  very senior, very hushhush --
16) 208) dialog: Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer,  but this story is hot and you're no  longer on top of it. Why, it's the  scoop of the century -- the other  papers won't have the Gunderson dope  'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer  Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking  on our dust come mornin' --
