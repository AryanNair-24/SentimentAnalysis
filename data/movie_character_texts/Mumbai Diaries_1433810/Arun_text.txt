Rakesh tries a couple of light switches but nothing comes on. There’s a little light from the fading sun. Rakesh, a weasly 23 year old umbilically attached to his cell phone, tries to push open a window which is firmly stuck, while talking into his phone cradled between his ear and shoulder.

Well heeled so-called art lovers mingle, as wine, champagne and hors d’oeuvres do the rounds. Press photographers take pictures. Shai is being introduced to some people by her mother Pravin, while Pesi talks to a serious looking man. Later Shai looks at the works. The installations, which have an Escher-esque construction about them, are made from what seems like scrap and waste materials. Shai looks around, a bit fidgety, observing all the different kinds of people there. Arun walks in. She sees him and keeps looking at him, finding him attractive.
5) 5) text: Well, there’s not much to say, I think. This is my most transparent work. Its my tribute to the people from Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, U.P. and elsewhere who build this city in the hope that someday they will find a rightful place in it. So, to Bombay, my muse, my whore, my beloved... He raises his glass as a toast, the crowd raises their glasses in a ‘salut’, and Arun knocks back his drink and hurries into the crowd. Then there’s clapping and bravo’s. Shai and Pesi also clap and the party is resumed. Pesi looks about him animatedly, as if for a victim.
5) 12) text: Arun, I am Miraj Husain from the Indian Council for Art. I’ve been talking to Vatsala about taking some works of yours for a group show to Munich, Brussels, London and Madrid. Arun nods, a little high and wanting to escape. Mona drifts away, bored.

7) 32) dialog: No, Shai I...
7) 34) dialog: Shai! She stops and turns around. They look at each other. Arun looks distraught. She relents.
7) 36) dialog: Munna. Aao. Munna walks in, opens the bundle and carefully places the washed and ironed clothes on the one available clear surface.
7) 38) dialog: (distracted, thinking) Huh?.. Er haan... Oh nahin, Munna main kuch din mein ghar badli kar raha hoon. Vahan aayega na?
12) 0) text: Arun has finished unpacking. The apartment has been freshly painted. All the furniture is gone barring a large dining table in the corner, on which Arun has put his computer and lots of books. Siddheswari Devi is singing thumri on his computer. In the drawing room there are two hooks for fans, but only one has a fan. There’s a stack of cartons that he carries around looking for a loft. He finds one, pulls a stool and tries to open it. Its stuck fast. He gets a screwdriver and hammer and chips it open. In the light of his torch he finds a couple of broken pieces of furniture and a small cloth potli. These he throws on the ground, and stuffs the cartons in. He sits at the table and opens the cloth potli. In it there’s a photograph of a girl (16) and boy (10) with an old lady, all smiling in a studio against a background of a garden with tulips. There’s also an old surme daani, a ring on a chain and three DV tapes. The tapes have written on their spine - Pehli Chitthi, Doosri Chitthi and Teesri Chitthi, along with Yasmin Noor on each.

The TV seems to be on there, and a young boy runs in with another boy, talks to her and runs out. On the other side, he sees a building under construction (which is where Selva works). There is a big light on and workers are still working. He looks around at his new space. He picks up his drawing book and sketches a bit of the view from his window/doodles, then gets up, stretches and looks around. He sees the stuff from the potli on the table. He picks up the photo and looks at it. There’s a great warmth in the faces bathed in clear light. He picks up the tape and looks at the cover, turning it around in his hand.

The lady is instructing the maid now, and she has henna in her hair. Its a Sunday morning, and things are relaxed. Arun looks radiant, charged in a way. He turns to the TV thoughtfully, looking at the house with new eyes. Then he puts the kettle on for tea. INT. SHAI’S APARTMENT - DAY 32 Shai is holding up her shirt which had the stain.

He puts down his brush and gets out the chain and the ring. He gently examines the ring, turning it round in the light. It is a delicate pearl set in silver which has become tarnished. Arun smells it, looks at it, then tries it on one of his fingers. It doesn’t fit any. He takes the ring and chain into the bathroom and puts them into a mug of soapy water. Then he uses his toothbrush to clean them.

SHAI’S APARTMENT (BALCONY) - LATER - NIGHT Later she brings a bottle of single malt and two glasses. She offers him one, he refuses, she presses him so he takes one and takes a sip. It tastes ugly to him, and she is vastly amused. She is mildly flirtatious in her manner. Later she has fallen asleep. Munna comes very close to her and looks at her face as she sleeps.

He takes the call, and as he hears Vatsala say “hello? hello?” at the other end, he drops the phone into the toilet and pulls the flush on it. He watches the phone drown with satisfaction. Then he goes to the kitchen and puts on the kettle for tea.
