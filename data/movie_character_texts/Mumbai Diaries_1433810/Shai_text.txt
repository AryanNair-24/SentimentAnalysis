4) 0) text: Munna darts across the road and a car swerves to avoid him causing a little confusion. Munna continues to walk, and the driver swears under his breath. We cut inside the car to Shai, 29, very attractive and stylish, and Pesi (32). The windows are up and Shirley Bassey is on the stereo.
4) 1) dialog: Shit! What did he think he was doing? Crazy!
4) 3) dialog: And we are so late, Pesi! My mum left for the show an hour ago.
5) 0) text: Its a modest sized, interesting gallery, opening the new works of T. Arun; paintings, etchings and some small installations. Well heeled so-called art lovers mingle, as wine, champagne and hors d’oeuvres do the rounds. Press photographers take pictures. Shai is being introduced to some people by her mother Pravin, while Pesi talks to a serious looking man. Later Shai looks at the works. The installations, which have an Escher-esque construction about them, are made from what seems like scrap and waste materials. Shai looks around, a bit fidgety, observing all the different kinds of people there. Arun walks in. She sees him and keeps looking at him, finding him attractive.
5) 3) dialog: Which one is Arun. Pesi points him out. She looks at him and widens her eyes meaningfully. Pesi returns the look, first quizzical then catching on. Vatsala calls everyone to attention.
5) 5) text: Well, there’s not much to say, I think. This is my most transparent work. Its my tribute to the people from Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, U.P. and elsewhere who build this city in the hope that someday they will find a rightful place in it. So, to Bombay, my muse, my whore, my beloved... He raises his glass as a toast, the crowd raises their glasses in a ‘salut’, and Arun knocks back his drink and hurries into the crowd. Then there’s clapping and bravo’s. Shai and Pesi also clap and the party is resumed. Pesi looks about him animatedly, as if for a victim.
5) 7) dialog: Babe, he’s beautiful.
5) 9) dialog: Thank god for that! At least one boy in Bombay is available then! Elsewhere Arun has been cornered by a lady in big diamonds.
5) 15) dialog: That bad?
5) 17) dialog: Hi, I’m Shai. Yes I thought you looked a bit stricken.. Both laugh. He knocks back his drink, she’s vastly amused, and he looks at her with warmth. They share some sort of secret now.
5) 19) dialog: No, no, I’m an investment banking consultant.
5) 21) dialog: (laughing) Yes, broadly speaking! Essentially I study investment trends in south Asian economies.
5) 23) dialog: No, in New York. I’ve moved back here for a bit though.
5) 25) dialog: Well, I just needed a break from things... A new perspective, some fresh air in my head.
5) 27) dialog: (laughs) Maybe just a change of scene then. Some new faces, no New York winter, and no talking about figures and projections...
5) 29) dialog: Actually, its not a holiday, I’m on a sabbatical! 10.
5) 31) dialog: Means I’ve got a research grant to submit a project about small and marginal business and shifts in traditional occupations. Basically I have to write some papers, and do what I love doing best - taking photographs. Arun raises his eyebrows as he keeps swigging his rum and coke. There’s a squawk from someone, then a shriek and a ripple of panic runs through the room as a rat scurries to find safe refuge. Shai is knocked against in the melee and she gets red wine all over her shirt. Arun starts laughing and Shai, though irritated can’t help laughing as well, wiping her shirt with a proffered napkin. SHAI (CONT’D) Shit.
7) 3) dialog: Hi. Shai walks into the room and looks around, realizing there isn’t really any place to sit. SHAI (CONT’D) You been up long?
7) 5) dialog: I’d love some. Listen I just helped myself to a shirt that was lying on your chair, because mine was trashed with that wine stain..
7) 7) dialog: I haven’t stayed up so long talking in years! And I don’t think I’ve ever danced to... what was it? “Sexy Sadie”! (laughs) You, my friend, are quite the dancer!
7) 9) dialog: Yes please. (she watches him) I had a lovely time last night. 13. She looks at him fondly, but his smile is embarrassed and he avoids looking at her. He washes the cup and hunts around for the sugar. He pulls out a sachet from a bag of sachets, and goes to the fridge and pulls out a carton of milk. Shai wanders out into the living room and looks around. She sees a little sketch/personal item of Arun’s that she quickly puts in her pocket, checking to see if he saw. She sees a painting on the bookshelf of a black and white photograph of a couple. The man is in army uniform and the lady is a south Indian beauty in wedding finery. The photograph has been painted on, with scraps and bits stuck on - a button, a safety pin, a badge. SHAI (CONT’D) (calling out to him) Are these your parents? Arun hands her a mug of tea, and settles against the window again, standing awkwardly while Shai settles into a chair. Arun looks at the painting, and nods, with a half smile. SHAI (CONT’D) So your father was in the army, was he?
7) 11) dialog: Do they live with you?
7) 13) dialog: Tell me do you usually live like this, out of boxes?!
7) 15) dialog: Really? Why?
7) 17) dialog: Oh... so you’ve found another place have you? 14.
7) 19) dialog: You know I found your opening last night quite an experience. Are they all like that, these art events? Arun shrugs. SHAI (CONT’D) My mom loves these arty dos! She’s quite a collector. We have a lot of art at home. In fact we’re running short of walls! (no reply forthcoming) Have you always lived in Bombay?
7) 21) dialog: Are you hung over?
7) 23) dialog: You’re so quiet today... Arun looks distinctly on edge. SHAI (CONT’D) Hey, is something wrong? Arun looks away.
7) 25) dialog: Hey... What’re you sorry about? Don’t be sorry, I had a great time!
7) 27) dialog: Hey, it’s cool. I’m glad you don’t normally do this! I mean, hey! I don’t either! I guess we shared something with each other which was... I don’t know.. special.
7) 29) dialog: More serious than a shag? She gets up and starts putting her things into her bag, ready to leave.
7) 31) dialog: Will you stop fucking apologizing? Jeez!!
7) 33) dialog: Hey, I have no idea what’s going on in your head, okay, and I’m not sure I want to know. She turns and opens the door.
7) 35) dialog: Arun, you know what, it’s cool. Take care. See you around. She gives him a false smile and shuts the door behind her. He’s left staring at the closed door. INT. LANDING OUTSIDE ARUN’S APARTMENT - DAY 13 Shai is waiting at the elevator, angry tears welling up in her eyes. 14 15 16. She presses the call button, then jabs it several time angrily, then hits it saying “Shit!” and hurries down the stairs. As she disappears the lift reaches the landing, and Munna emerges with a bundle of clothes, humming a tune. INT. LANDING OUTSIDE ARUN’S APARTMENT - DAY (CONT’D) 14 Arun opens the door with an expectant expression, which falls when he sees Munna. He scans the landing behind Munna, then turns back disappointed. Munna is smiling, like he’s used to Arun being vague.
9) 0) text: Selva and the other workers take a break to eat some lunch. They sit in ragged groups, with their children around them, wearing their work clothes and eating with chalky hands. INT. SHAI’S APARTMENT - DAY 17 Shai is on the phone in her affluent Worli seaface apartment, lounging in a chair in her balcony overlooking the sea.
9) 1) dialog: No, I guess you’re right, but I don’t know, Pesi. I really thought he was special, you know, we really got on the night before, and had such deep discussions..and... The doorbell rings. She ignores it. SHAI (CONT’D) You know, about stuff... art, money, Bombay, and... (laughs) OK, yes, great sex! Really good sex... Well basically Dale and I left it open ended, so that’s not so much that , but its just I’m so mixed up in my head right now, you know?... No but it wasn’t just the sex, you know Pes.. It rings again. SHAI (CONT’D) (shouting in the direction of the door) Agnes! (back into the mouthpiece) Its just that it seemed like there was something more there, you know? I mean we slow danced , for chrissakes! Who does that these days!.. The doorbell rings again. She makes a sound of irritation and gets up to open it. She talks as she opens the door. 19. SHAI (CONT’D) Like he was really into me the night before, he was really intense... hold on a sec. The door opens to Munna, carrying a bundle of clothes. Shai looks at him blankly. SHAI (CONT’D) Yes?
9) 3) dialog: Oh. Accha. Andar aao. Agnes! Pesi, babe I’m going to have to call you back, this dhobi guy is at the door and Agnes has disappeared on me... yeah soon. I promise! Okay, bye! They head in. Shai looks a bit lost, but Munna is familiar with the routine. He unties the bundle and places the neat pile on the side board.
9) 5) dialog: Oh my god! Yeh.. Yeh to neel ho gaya!
9) 7) dialog: Oh shit! Maine Agnes ko bolna chahiye tha, ise laundry mein dena tha! Its completely fucked, now! Munna’s face falls. He puts his hand out to take it back.

11) 0) text: There’s busy activity. Salim is sitting next to where Munna is washing clothes. He is talking on his cell phone, its some kind of property deal. Munna looks through the clothes. Shai’s white one is right on top. He notices a cool striped shirt in the pile. He looks at the size, it seems right, so he puts it aside. He picks up Shai’s shirt and looks at it with concentration.
13) 0) text: Shai is taking pictures of the circus artists from the wings. It seems like an impoverished troupe, and the clowns are not very funny. Even the children aren’t laughing. The artists are so keen to pose for Shai, one of them (a juggler) forgets his cue. They tell her how the circus has lost its shine without the animals. There’s also a Wonder Dog, an old Pomeranian who stands on his hind legs and balances a ball on his head. 22 22. She gives one-woof and two-woof answers to questions the comic dog trainer asks her.
13) 3) dialog: Pesi, tell me you’re not loving this?! Pesi fixes Shai with a ‘look’. Shai laughs. SHAI (CONT’D) Okay, we’ll leave in a minute. A movie on me after this, okay?

15) 11) dialog: Kaun si film dekhne aaye ho?
15) 13) dialog: Hum bhi vahi dekhne ja rahe hain. Mera life mein yeh first hindi movie hai! Chalo, bye! As she heads in to the theatre, Salim turns to Munna with a raised eyebrow. Munna’s stock value appears to have appreciated.
16) 0) text: Munna’s eyes follow Shai as she and Pesi find their seats. Salim notices this and smiles. The lights go down.
22) 0) text: Arun wakes up with a crick in his neck. He had fallen asleep watching the video, the TV is still on and he has the remote in his lap. Daylight streams into the flat. He gets up, stretches and goes over to the window. He can see the same lady in the flat opposite, except her son is almost a teenager now. The lady is instructing the maid now, and she has henna in her hair. Its a Sunday morning, and things are relaxed. Arun looks radiant, charged in a way. He turns to the TV thoughtfully, looking at the house with new eyes. Then he puts the kettle on for tea. INT. SHAI’S APARTMENT - DAY 32 Shai is holding up her shirt which had the stain. Its a spotless white, as good as new. She turns and smiles. Munna avoids her gaze, but one can tell he’s pleased.
22) 1) dialog: Chai loge? Munna nods, trying to look casual. Agnes who is standing near the two of them looks taken aback at the exchange. SHAI (CONT’D) Agnes, please do cup chai banana? Agnes leaves, not at all happy. Shai walks to the balcony, gestures to him to follow. Munna looks around the house. Sees himself in a mirror, and adjusts his hair. He wears a cute Doors t shirt. They sit in chairs on the balcony and look out to sea. Shai’s camera is on a table, which she has taken apart. SHAI (CONT’D) (pointing to his t shirt) You like The Doors? Munna smiles and nods like he knows what she is talking about. There’s a little awkward pause.

22) 9) dialog: Sara family yahan hai?
22) 11) dialog: Jaate ho vaapas, milne?
22) 13) dialog: Kyun? SHAI (CONT’D) Unki yaad nahin aati? his tongue in a negative. SHAI (CONT’D) Ghar pe accha nahin lagta tha kya? 31.
22) 15) dialog: Par vahan kya farming... kya kehte hain... kheti nahin thi tum logon ki?
22) 17) dialog: Kya? Sure. She reaches for the camera.
22) 19) dialog: Kyun? Model banna hai kya? Shai says it jokingly, then realizes that he is serious.
22) 21) dialog: Accha... Haan, main try kar sakti hoon... I’ve never really done that sort of thing.
22) 23) dialog: Main le sakti hoon, sure. Munna looks pleased. 32. SHAI (CONT’D) But tumhe mere liye kuch karna padega. Mujhe tumhara photo chahiye, tum jab apna kaam kar raha hai.
22) 25) dialog: Arre dhobi ka, what else. Okay? He nods, happy. Agnes comes in with one glass and one mug of tea. Shai looks at her pointedly, and takes the glass, giving Munna the mug. Agnes also holds up a shirt which is Arun’s, shaking it at Munna.
22) 27) dialog: Oh yeh mera hai...
22) 29) dialog: Tum Arun ko jaante ho? Artist Arun?
22) 31) dialog: To tumhe maloom hai ki uska new house kahan par hai?

24) 13) dialog: Ufff, who’s going for the food?

26) 15) dialog: Ashish?... Hey... Listen, I need your help, man.
27) 0) text: Its a small run-down studio with a few umbrella lights, used mainly for portfolios. A couple of studio hands look at them suspiciously. Shai puts her kit down and looks around. She sees all the photography lights that are triggered by the flash which she is totally unfamiliar with.
27) 1) dialog: Aapke paas koi light hai jo on rehta hai? Not flash? They go off and get her some basic lights. She sighs, feeling out of her depth, but seeing Munna with his expectant expression she perks up for his sake. SHAI (CONT’D) Chalo Munna, lets get started! MONTAGE: Munna smiling, Munna looking like the sweet boy- next-door, Munna with typical ‘hero’ expression... At som point she takes the old wooden chair that the attendant is sitting on and makes Munna do things with it. SHAI (CONT’D) Munna, ab smile mat karo, just seedha idhar dekho.. Haan, better. (MORE)

27) 4) dialog: OK, utaro, try karte hain. He peels off his T shirt. He has a beautiful body. Its suddenly harder for Shai to give instructions, she finds him very attractive. She takes a whole series of him, in beautiful half light.
30) 13) dialog: To? Tumhe mera kaam kaisa laga? Accha laga?
30) 15) dialog: Great! Thank heavens. Chai? Munna nods a yes and she gestures to him to follow her. He follows her to the kitchen, looking around him at the house. Shai puts a kettle on and takes out tea bags and mugs. SHAI (CONT’D) Tum mere first client ho, to main nervous thi!
30) 17) dialog: Kya?
30) 19) dialog: Er... mujhe to bohut acche lage. See this one.. and this.. I prefer this attitude. Munna nods like he understands.

Munna smiles in acquiescence. He looks around the drawing room they’re sitting in. There’s assorted photographs of Shai and her brother Veer with her parents.
30) 23) dialog: In-sha-allah... (turning it around on her tongue) Munna grins at her and nods.
33) 0) text: Shai is watching Arun through her camera lens from a vantage point of a building terrace opposite. She trains her lens at him, watching as he watches Yasmin on his TV, sometimes going very close to the TV screen, his expressions, him pouring himself a drink, smoking a cigarette... We see Selva and a few others, skulking about behind her, trying to see what she’s doing, but she turns to look at them, and they shuffle off. Her phone rings.
