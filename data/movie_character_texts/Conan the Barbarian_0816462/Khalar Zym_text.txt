13) 38) dialog: All you wish, once we are gone.

13) 54) dialog: But I seek a woman.
13) 63) dialog: Then our stories began in the same place, Cimmerian. I too lost my wife to marauders. How many men, in how many lands have suffered so? The only answer is power, strength unfettered, the kind of which can unite all Hyboria under a single crown. That is the legacy I seek. Will you join me?
13) 81) dialog: Show me your strength, Fariq. Without it, you will never rule. With it, you will never be forgotten.
13) 92) dialog: Burn this place. It no longer exists.

22) 10) dialog: Take care, Ukafa. You hold a special place in my kingdom, but blood you are not.
22) 15) dialog: And I would gladly sacrifice every last man to get my hands on the Queen. And in that respect, Fariq has my confidence. He knows more of the legends of Acheron than anyone.
29) 4) dialog: Who was guarding that gate?
29) 9) dialog: Take four legions. Hunt her. Before I hunt you.
31) 6) dialog: All these years searching the ends of the earth. And here you are. Just a two day ride from Khor Kalba. I can scarcely believe it.
31) 10) dialog: 
31) 18) dialog: Yes. I come to resurrect the greatest empire Hyboria has ever known.
31) 23) dialog: Have you hidden from the world so long that you cannot to see? Blood, magic, death: it is everywhere. Acheron is no different than any other kingdom, but for its glory.
31) 38) dialog: Yes. You will.
40) 7) dialog: 
40) 10) dialog: He brought a message?
40) 24) dialog: Enough! We will take no chances. We will pay this thief what he wants, and more.

43) 17) dialog: 
43) 20) dialog: 
43) 41) dialog: 
43) 44) dialog: You're fast. But are you fast enough?
43) 69) dialog: Fariq!
43) 75) dialog: I wasn't cowering. I was studying. You're quite gifted with a sword, but it's not from schooling. Your speed and power makes up for a lack of -- finesse. I've seen such fighting before -- Cimmerian.
43) 113) dialog: 
43) 121) dialog: Ukafa, you will take half our forces North, to the Sea. I will take the rest South.
43) 126) dialog: You will return to Khor Kalba. You will feed the women to the beast until you find our Queen.
43) 131) dialog: You think I care what you wish?! You want to play warrior? It is not in you. One day you will be king, but warlord, never.
43) 135) dialog: You will not risk your life again. You are my line, my successor. You will not throw away all that I have worked for.

56) 13) dialog: The chase is over. They come to me now.
72) 13) dialog: It's only begun. Because that one was not the heir to Acheron.
72) 21) dialog: Secretive, the traitors of Acheron. It wasn't easy, but Fariq finally wrung honesty from the girl. That poor innocent was forced to live a lie, even as the truth was kept from the queen herself.
75) 6) dialog: You see only with your eyes.
75) 18) dialog: The Acheronians had a wonderful sense of balance, don't you think? For one to ascend to royalty, another must fall.
77) 6) dialog: But I do. For thirty years I have dreamed of this day. The day our people rise from the ashes.
79) 3) dialog: It's good that you pray. Gods will be here soon.
79) 8) dialog: Who?
79) 16) dialog: I will say this for you, barbarian. You are hard to kill.
79) 20) dialog: You've faced me before and lost. What do you think has changed now?
79) 31) dialog: You are strong, Cimmerian, but we both know you are not my equal.

79) 131) dialog: 
79) 145) dialog: They take her to a place you can never follow. Who will you fail, Cimmerian? Your father or your woman?
