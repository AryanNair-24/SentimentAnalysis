Romantic, foolish notions that appeal to feeble minds and justify idiot behavior such as suicide. (leans in, softly) Go home, Montag. Hug your wife. Beatty departs.

0) 661) dialog: Where did it begin, you ask, this thing we do? How did it start? The TV room comes to life. We're surrounded by images, Mo and Beatty seemingly transported into the events on scree Book burnings. Many of these images were once black & whi but have since been digitally enhanced and colorized.
0) 662) dialog: They used to teach this stuff in the Academy. Gave the rookies a good grounding in fundamentals. Not so much anymore. Shame. As they watch: Bolsheviks burn decadent capitalist literature. The Nazi faithful hurl armloads of books onto raging bonf sending geysers of embers swirling into the air. Southern Baptists torch truckloads of Elvis and Beatles records, spicing the mix with armloads of "Catcher in the Rye," "Slaughterhouse Five," "Lolita." A veritable orgy of flame. Vonnegut. Wilde. Bradbury. Row Ellison. Shelley. Shaw. Heretics being burned at the stak
0) 664) dialog: It's nothing new, Montag, what we do. Admittedly, in the past, it's been unfocused. Haphazard. Disharmonious. Various special interest groups trying to get the better of other special interest groups whose special interests they disapproved of. Opinions flying like hand grenades. Books wielded like stone clubs to smash one another over the head with. Pundits flinging their precious thoughts like apes flinging feces through the bars of a cage.
0) 668) dialog: Every so often a book would come along and turn the world on its ear. Marx and his manifesto. Hitler and his Kampf. Before you know it, it wasn't just books being burned. It was people. Not just a crazy old woman with a kitchen match, but by the millions. Entire cities. (to the TV) Show me London. Dresden. Tokyo. Click, click, click -- images of cities being consumed in massive firebombings.
0) 669) dialog: Hiroshima. Nagasaki. Mushroom clouds suddenly rise before Montag's eyes like s being born. Beatty's pacing, watching, circling Montag.
0) 670) dialog: Books are dangerous, Montag. Lethal in their power. The book burners had the right idea, of course, but they never burned right. They burned to prove some selfish point, not for the greater goal of harmony and the good of mankind. And then...then came the start of this century. And the beginning of clarity. Images of 9-11 are shocking in their ferocity. The Twin T burn, tumble, collapse...
0) 671) dialog: Books were fine once upon a time, back when there was plenty of room, in the days of horse and cart. But the world became far too vast, too complex, too dangerous. Our agendas could no longer conflict, not if we were to survive. Pulling together for a common goal, that's what was required. Books and divisive philosophies need not apply. I won't stomach them for a moment, nor should you. The stakes were, and are, far too great. Millie enters with tea. Beatty takes a cup. The screens d increasingly futuristic forms of warfare in a wide variet lands. Floating hovertanks. Smarter and smarter bombs.
0) 675) dialog: Peace, Montag. Harmony, Montag. Security, Montag. Happiness. (to Millie) That's what everyone wants, isn't it, dear? Haven't you heard it all your life? I want to be happy, people say. Don't you? Doesn't everyone?
0) 677) dialog: That's us, Montag. The Happiness Twins. The Dixie Duo, you and I. We stand against those who want everyone unhappy and divided. I don't think you realize how important you are to the survival of our society. Recite the first two articles of faith from the fireman's manual.
0) 679) dialog: My God's better than your God. My morality is superior to yours. I disapprove of your life, your choices, your culture, your politics, your smell. A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. So? Into the incinerator with it. All men made equal. All men made happy. Blacks don't like "Little Black Sambo?" Burn it. Whites are ashamed of "Uncle Tom's Cabin?" Scorch it. "Johnny Got His Gun" demoralizing our troops and hindering the war effort? Render its ashes unto Caesar, lest the empire fall. (sits, faces Montag) We've been at war since before you and I were born. You did your military service as required, and with distinction. So did I. So must we all do our parts -- no ifs, ands, (MORE)
0) 682) dialog: or maybes -- or we shall lose someday. Our country, our people, our way of life -- that's what's at stake. (to the room) Enough. The screens go dark, silent. Beatty pulls out his lighter flicks it on-off, on-off. Admiring the flame. He looks at Montag with a twinkle in his eye.
0) 683) dialog: Tell you a little secret. I've read a few books in my day. I had doubts, too, as a younger man. Questions. I had to know what I was about. He draws a cigar from his inner pocket, applies the flame He puffs the Montag nods. Beatty rises
0) 685) dialog: And the more I read, the more I did know. I came to know the face of my enemy and the truth of my calling. Books, dear Montag, say nothing. They're good for one thing. The application of heat. Four hundred and fifty one degrees Fahrenheit, to be precise. cigar to life.
0) 687) dialog: Take a book home? His mouth is dry.
0) 688) dialog: A natural error. Curiosity alone. We don't get anxious or mad. We let the fireman keep the book for a day or two. If he hasn't burned it by then, well...we simply come and burn it for him. (off Montag's look) Fire is bright, and fire is clean. Feel better, my boy. I hope to see you back before too long. and exits past Millie hovering in the doorway.
0) 692) dialog: Thank you for the tea.
0) 812) dialog: (looks over) Some neighbors you had. Just never know, I guess. He's idly paging a book in his hands. Montag glances down and, with a jolt, realizes it's "Charlie the Choo Choo." The captain moves off, tosses it onto a roaring pyre of o books.
0) 824) dialog: I was skimming the city reports from last night. (nods to his computer) Had some excitement out your way? Just a few doors down, was it? (Montag nods) Rang up Jeffers at third district. He said you showed up barefoot in pajamas. Ready to pitch in and lend a hand, were you?
0) 826) dialog: This file goes back generations. A long line of misfits and oddballs. They were even homeschooling the daughter, you imagine? Stunning, the crap they got away with, wearing the masks of normal people. (beat) Ever meet them? A loaded question, posed casually. Montag knows it, too. keeps his tone conversational:

0) 974) dialog: Well, nevermind, just in time! Thank goodness, it's just not a fire without you! (turns, yelling)
0) 979) dialog: Montag, where's that grin?
0) 981) dialog: The fierce grin of all men singed and driven back by flame! Isn't this what we love? Isn't this what we do best?
0) 986) dialog: No worries. I've cleared it through channels. ...and Beatty glances back as CAMERA CONTINUES PAST HIM, closing on Montag. He's at a loss, trying to comprehend:
0) 989) dialog: At ease. We're dispensing with protocol. Tonight is a special occasion. Tonight we do things just a little differently. (glances up to Montag) Isn't that right? Feeling like a man in a dream, Montag steps down and walk forward to face Beatty.
0) 990) dialog: (announcing to all) No pumpers! No kerosene! No pretty beacon on the lawn! Tonight we get a special treat! A display of dedication and skill nonpareil! One man! One flamethrower! (locks eyes with Montag) Mr. Ormsby! Mr. Landers! Bring one down, if you please! Ormsby and Landers heft a flamethrower off its mount and it down from the truck, hustling it over as: The front door of the house bursts open and Millie hurrie down the walk, dressed for travel and dragging a suitcase
0) 992) dialog: Don't blame her, Montag, not for your stupidity. Montag, stunned, meets her as she reaches the curb. She's exried out, looking back at the house:
0) 999) dialog: Officers. A domestic dispute. Would you please see after Mrs. Montag? Take her where she wants to go? As Millie is helped away, Beatty snaps his fingers at Orm and Landers. They sling the flamethrower onto Montag's ba tightening straps and snapping buckles as:
0) 1000) dialog: Don't look so shocked. You didn't leave her much choice, did you? Poor thing was terrified. It was the third alarm she called in. I ignored the first two, told her to be patient. Said you'd come around. What a sad disappointment you are. How are those straps, secure? Let's get that pilot lit. Montag activates the gas feed. Beatty himself applies the igniter. A gentle flame blooms.
0) 1001) dialog: Now. Let's finish what you started. They march toward the house, Beatty and Montag, as the ot watch. Beatty turns back, calling to them... .
0) 1002) dialog: Break out some windows! Let's get some cross ventilation! --and in that moment, Montag sneaks the "seashell" from h pocket and slips it in his ear.
0) 1011) dialog: Funny how that works. Everybody thinks, everybody is absolutely certain, that nothing will ever happen to them. Others die, I go on. Others get caught, not me. Consequences? Never. Except sometimes there are. And by the time they catch up, it's too late.
0) 1015) dialog: You're a well read man, how about a few well-chosen quotes? No? Allow me. "Day of wrath, O day of mourning! See fulfilled the prophet's warning! Heaven and earth in ashes burning!" (bellows)

0) 1022) dialog: That's the ticket, well done! You can't tell me that didn't feel good! All your sins washed away with good cleansing fire! Onward, Montag! Lead the way!
0) 1025) dialog: Something here you'd like to burn? The sorrow of past regrets? The stench of failure? That blow-dried imbecile and his chattering hag? Montag pulls the trigger. The FIRE BURSTS FORTH, hitting screens and imploding them. The vacuum sucks fire in and belches it out again, plastic igniting as the babble of t Family gives way to the HIDEOUS SHRIEK OF MELTING SPEAKER THE BEDROOM: Montag stares at the bed he shared for years with his wife. WHOOOQOOSH! Up it goes, a funeral pyre... THE KITCHEN: WHOOOOOSH! Table, countertop, appliances -- THE HALLWAY: A flaming corridor.

0) 1034) dialog: No.
0) 1041) dialog: From the start. Montag, you idiot. Our Hound smelled the books on you. He raises his plasma screen clipboard, punches in a playb command, turns it so Montag can see. On it, a recording: THE HOUND'S POV: We've seen this moment before -- Montag around the firetruck the night he took the first two book freezing in his tracks as he encounters the beast.
0) 1042) dialog: {enters new command) So I checked the surveillance cams. Lo and behold. A new image pops up. From a hidden ceiling cam, we see Mo pulling the first book out of the Scooper blade. Beatty f the image, tracking it in for a TIGHT CLOSEUP.

0) 1046) dialog: Really? The man nods. Beatty sends him off, turns back to Montag. There's a new look in Beatty's eye -- hungry, vengeful.
0) 1047) dialog: I gave you every chance. Tried to woo you, reason with you. I even sent the Hound to sniff around your house at night and throw a scare into you. Even that didn't work... (cocks his head) -.-though it did get your neighbors burned out and on the run. Yes, your fault. All your fault. (closing on him) You dense...arrogant...traitorous... ungrateful little bastard. Beatty stuns Montag by hauling off and slapping him hard the ear (the one with the seashell in it). WHAP!
0) 1050) dialog: After all I did for you. After the kindness I showed. WHAP! Another slap across the same ear. Montag clutches t side of his head in agony --
0) 1051) dialog: I vouched for you. Put my professional standing on the line for you. This is how you repay me? And betray me? WHAP! Beatty slaps him a third time -- only this time use his other hand. The blow rocks Montag's head, and: The seashell flies from his ear, skittering onto the pave
0) 1055) dialog: Your pal Faber? (off Montag's shock) Of course I know! I've been tracking your every step! There are cameras on every street corner of this city, you moron! And Faber's been under surveillance from the moment his nephew went on the run! (raises his clipboard) We have you talking to him in the park! Entering his building! Chatting on the roof! Want to see? Or are you willing to take my word for it?
0) 1057) dialog: Go ahead, yell. He can't hear you. We've jammed the transmission. (closing in) The next thing Mr. Faber knows, the police will be kicking his door in. WS Want to go over there, just to see the look on his face? Oh, dear, I almost forgot. You'll be in custody yourself. For treason and sedition. (stops before him) If you're through making a fool of yourself, you're under arrest. Beat. Montag stands pinned in Beatty's gaze. And then: CLICK. He works the safety catch on the flamethrower. The flame billows up with a gentle hiss. Beatty goes stiff, eyes widening slightly. And he smiles.
0) 1058) dialog: Well, that's one way to get an audience. Hold a gun on a man and make him listen to your speech. Well, speech away. What'll it be this time? Why don't you belch Shakespeare at me? "There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, for I am armed so strong in honesty that they pass me as an idle wind, which I respect not!" How's that? Go ahead, you trembling little prick. Pull the trigger.

An ERUPTION OF FIRE leaps out and hits Beat square in the chest, a searing fist of flame that grips h envelops him, drives him back, blows him off his feet. Beatty sails through the air on a booster of fire, a blaz shrieking scarecrow. He lands on his back in a flaming he arms flailing and legs drumming...and then goes still. A hush falls.
