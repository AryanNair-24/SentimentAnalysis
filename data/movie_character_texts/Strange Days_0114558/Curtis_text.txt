49) 0) text: On Zander, face lighting up, giving Lenny a high five. Lenny drops his bag, shakes, does a little silly hand choreography -- a goof on a bro grip -- that makes Zander laugh.  Mace watches this ritual and smiles herself. Zander can call out a part of Lenny that Mace would like to see more of. Cecile is there, hanging out with her boyfriend CURTIS, and Curtis' friend VEJ.  These two guys are about 18, dressed in gangsta garb.  They are listening to "The Prophets of Rage" on a CD player, and watch Lenny with a dispassion that flirts with distaste.

There are flashes and explosions.  It could be a celebration, or a war zone.  Maybe both.  Or one about to turn into the other. Mace is driving, scanning the streets.  She has her .380 auto in her hand, resting in her lap.  Lenny is riding shotgun, while Curtis, Cecile and Zander are in the back seat.
59) 0) text: Mace watches Zander lighting bottle rockets with Curtis o the balcony of the apartment... visible through the window.  Staccato fireworks nearby sound like automatic weapons, making her flinch.  She goes back into the... KITCHEN.  Where she sees Lenny sitting at the table, trodes in his hands.  Stunned.  Face the color of old cement.  Hands shaking.
