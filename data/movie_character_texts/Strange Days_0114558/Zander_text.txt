Mace heads into the house, picking up a couple of toys left scattered in the front yard. Inside, ZANDER, age 6, is watching TV in his pajamas and eating a bowl of cereal.  Behind him, on the couch, is Mace's younger sister CECILE, zee'd-out.  Zander frowns a her and looks at a red-plastic (toy) watch.

Mace watches this ritual and smiles herself. Zander can call out a part of Lenny that Mace would like to see more of. Cecile is there, hanging out with her boyfriend CURTIS, and Curtis' friend VEJ.  These two guys are about 18, dressed in gangsta garb.  They are listening to "The Prophets of Rage" on a CD player, and watch Lenny with a dispassion that flirts with distaste.
49) 1) dialog: What do you got?
49) 8) dialog: Let's play it now!
49) 13) text: You're not the only little boy I have to look out for, honey. Zander nods: OK.  Lenny gives him the grip.  Zander's han outmaneuvers his, and the boy smiles in triumph.

56) 0) text: Sirens pierce the night.  Two pillars of fire are visible blocks away.  There are dark crowds of people everywhere. People on the sidewalks, lighting fireworks.  There are flashes and explosions.  It could be a celebration, or a war zone.  Maybe both.  Or one about to turn into the other. Mace is driving, scanning the streets.  She has her .380 auto in her hand, resting in her lap.  Lenny is riding shotgun, while Curtis, Cecile and Zander are in the back seat.
57) 0) text: It is gang territory pure and simple.  Blacks and Hispanics.  Graffiti everywhere.  Burned-out buildings. Lenny sees abject poverty, here.  Even so, people are partying. They pull up to the front of Cecile's apartment building and get out. There are some homeboys chillin' on the front steps who give Mace the local hand-sign.  She returns the sign automatically as she carries Zander past them.
59) 0) text: Mace watches Zander lighting bottle rockets with Curtis o the balcony of the apartment... visible through the window.  Staccato fireworks nearby sound like automatic weapons, making her flinch.  She goes back into the... KITCHEN.  Where she sees Lenny sitting at the table, trodes in his hands.  Stunned.  Face the color of old cement.  Hands shaking.
62) 3) text: Listen to me, little sister. There's something going on, and it's very big.  Now you've got to take care of Zander.  And stay off the streets tonight... you hear me on this? Cecile gets the message.  She nods.
