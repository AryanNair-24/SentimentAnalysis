38) 3) dialog: And your stomach?
38) 5) dialog: And you love life?
38) 7) dialog: Anything else bothering you?
38) 9) text: She gives a low. Warm laugh, and the CAMERA PULLS BACK to show that Lisa has been bending over Jeff's wheelchair fr the side. As she straightens up, it PANS her swiftly over the corner of the room, keeping her in big closeup. She t on a low, hanging light. We see her full facial beauty for the first time. It is a warm, intelligent face.

38) 12) dialog: Carol --
38) 14) dialog: Fremont.
40) 1) dialog: Only because it's expected of her.
40) 3) dialog: Right off the Paris plane. Think it  will sell?
41) 2) dialog: -- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
41) 4) dialog: We sell a dozen a day in this price  range.
42) 1) dialog: Even if I had to pay, it would be   worth it -- just for the occasion.
42) 4) dialog: (Looking up from the  table) Going on right here. It's a big night.
42) 6) text: Lisa finds what she has been looking for. Picks up an old and cracked cigarette box, examines it as she talks.
42) 7) dialog: It's opening night of the last  depressing week of L. B. Jefferies  in a cast.
42) 10) dialog: (Smiling) That's because I bought out the house.  This cigarette box has seen better  days.
43) 0) text: Lisa facing Jeff in the chair.
43) 2) dialog: It's cracked -- and you never use  it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending  up a plain, flat silver one -- with  just your initials engraved.
43) 4) dialog: I wanted to, Jeff. (A sudden intake of  breath) Oh!
43) 6) dialog: What would you think of starting off  with dinner at the "21"?
45) 1) dialog: (Simply) Better than that. The "21."
47) 1) dialog: Thank you for waiting Carl.
47) 3) dialog: Kitchen's on the left. I'll take the  wine.
47) 8) dialog: (Up, to Carl) Just put everything right in the  oven Carl. On "low."
47) 10) dialog: (Enthusiastically) Let's open the wine now. It's a  Montrachet.
47) 13) dialog: Big enough?
47) 16) dialog: I couldn't think of anything more  boring and tiresome than what you've  been through. And the last week must  be the hardest.
47) 18) dialog: (Struggling with cork) Well, I'm going to make this a week  you'll never forget.
47) 19) text: Carl comes out of the kitchen carrying the empty warming  oven. He sets it down he sees Lisa struggling with the  corkscrew.

47) 22) dialog: This will take care of the taxi as  well.

They raise the glasses in a silent toast, and sip the wine. THE CAMERA C IN until they are both in a tight TOW SHOT.
47) 29) dialog: What a day I've had!
47) 31) dialog: Not a bit. I was all morning in a  sales meeting. Then over to the  Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame  Dufresne -- just over from Paris.  With some spy reports. Back to the  "21" for lunch with the Harper's  Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered  dinner. Then two Fall showings --  twenty blocks apart. Then I had to  have a cocktail with Leland and Slim  Hayward -- we're trying to get his  next show. (Softly, looking up  to him) Then I had to dash back and change.
47) 33) dialog: (Seriously) She looked very cool. She had on a  mint green --
47) 35) dialog: And to think, I planted three nice  items about you in the columns today.
47) 37) dialog: You can't buy that kind of publicity.
47) 39) dialog: Someday you might want to open up  your own studio here.
47) 42) dialog: Jeff -- isn't it time you came home?  You could pick your assignment.
47) 44) dialog: Make the one you want.
47) 46) dialog: Yes.
47) 48) dialog: For yourself -- and me. (She adds eagerly) I could get you a dozen assignments  tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
47) 50) dialog: (Offended) Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
47) 52) dialog: I could see you looking handsome and  successful in a dark blue flannel  suit.
47) 55) dialog: I'd better start setting up for  dinner.

54) 0) text: Jeff, his glass in hand, looks out sympathetically. He is unaware that Lisa is standing behind him, and is also wat this little drama.
54) 1) dialog: That's what is know as "manless  melancholia."
54) 3) dialog: Oh? You can see my apartment all the  way up on 63rd street?
55) 0) text: Jeff turns and looks up to Lisa with a grin.
55) 2) dialog: She's not in love with him -- or any  of them.
55) 4) dialog: You said it resembled my apartment,  didn't you?
63) 0) text: Jeff, listening to the composer. His head turns as Lisa's voice comes over:
63) 1) dialog: (Emerging from kitchen) Where's that music coming from?
63) 2) text: THE CAMERA QUICKLY PULL BACK as Jeff swings his chair aro Lisa is emerging from the kitchen, carrying the serving d of their lobster thermidor.

68) 4) text: Lisa draws back one leg, and points a finger challengingl
68) 5) dialog: If you're saying all this just because  you don't want to tell me the truth,  because you're hiding something from  me, then maybe I can understand --
68) 7) dialog: (Won't let him break  in) It doesn't make sense to me. What's  so different about it here from over  there, or any place you go, that one  person couldn't live in both places  just as easily?
68) 9) dialog: (Ignores him) What is it but traveling from one  place to another, taking pictures?  It's just like being a tourist on an  endless vacation.
68) 11) dialog: It's ridiculous for you to say that  it can only be done by a special,  private little group of anointed  people.
70) 0) text: Lisa, stretched out on the divan. She looks at him for a  moment without speaking. Then:
70) 1) dialog: If your opinion is as rude as your  manner, I'm not sure I want to hear  it.
70) 4) dialog: (Something starts her  up again) You can't fit in here -- I can't fit  in there. According to you, people  should be born, live an die on the  same --

73) 0) text: SHOOTING OVER LISA'S SHOULDER, and down her body, with Je in the chair beyond. Jeff says, as if remembering some ol experience:
73) 2) dialog: Jeff, you don't have to be  deliberately repulsive just to impress  me I'm wrong.
74) 0) text: Lisa realizes she is getting nowhere.
74) 1) dialog: You're too stubborn to argue with.
76) 0) text: Lisa, with sarcasm.
76) 1) dialog: I know. A lesser man would have told  me it was one long holiday -- and I  would have awakened to a rude  disillusionment.

78) 1) dialog: (Wearily) No. I don't particularly want that. (She turns, faces him) So that's it. You won't stay here --  I can't go with you.
80) 0) text: Lisa, from Jeff's viewpoint.
80) 1) dialog: You don't think either one of us  could ever change?
80) 3) text: Lisa begins to move around the room assembling her posses preparatory to leaving. She puts a comb, and other effect into a handbag. She gets her stole. All this as she talks.
80) 4) dialog: (Simply) I'm in love with you. I don't care  what you do for a living. Somehow I  would just like to be part of it.
82) 0) text: Lisa pauses in the act of gathering her things together.
82) 1) dialog: And it's deflating to find out that  the only way I can be part of it --  is to take out a subscription to  your magazine. I guess I'm not the  girl I thought I was.
82) 3) dialog: (Looks at Jeff) Not quite -- it seems. (Tosses a stole over  her shoulder) Goodbye, Jeff.
83) 2) dialog: I mean what I said.
84) 0) text: Lisa turns in the half-opened door.
84) 2) dialog: Without any future?

151) 1) dialog: Jeff -- I'll be honest with you --  you're beginning to scare me a little.
152) 0) text: Jeff is staring out of the window again. Over this we hea Lisa's voice:

THE CAMERA MOVES IN Lisa leans over Jeff, gripping both sides of his chair
156) 1) dialog: (sharply) Jeff -- if you could only see  yourself.
156) 3) dialog: (Abruptly) Sitting around, looking out a window  to kill time, is one thing -- but  doing it the way you are --  (She gestures) -- with, with binoculars, and with  wild opinions about every little  movement you see -- is, is diseased!
156) 5) dialog: I don't know what you consider it --  but if you don't stop it, I'm getting  out of here.
156) 7) dialog: (Insistent) What is it you're looking for?
156) 9) dialog: What makes you think something's  wrong with her?
156) 10) dialog: A lot of things. She's an invalid  who needs constant care -- and yet  the husband nor anyone else has been  in there all day.

156) 13) dialog: She could be under sedatives,  sleeping. (Looks up) He's in the room now.

156) 18) dialog: Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't  know, and I don't care. Lots of people  have saws, knives and ropes around  their houses. Lots of men don't speak  to their wives all day. Lots of wives  nag, and men hate them, and trouble  starts -- but very, very, very few  of them end up in murder -- if that's  what you're thinking.
156) 20) dialog: You could see all the things he did,  couldn't you?
156) 22) dialog: You could see that he did because he  had the shades in his apartment up,  and walked along the corridor, and  the streets and the backyard?
156) 24) dialog: Jeff, do you think a murderer would  let you see all that? That he  shouldn't keep his shades down and  hide behind them?
156) 26) dialog: And that's where you're not being  clever. He wouldn't parade his crime  in front of the open shades.
156) 28) dialog: (Pointing) For all you know -- there's something  a lot more sinister going on behind  those shades.
158) 2) dialog: Don't you see how silly you're being?
158) 4) text: Lisa half looks up and out the window. She opens her mout to answer, but a new look overtakes her face. It is conce surprise, and a little shock. Jeff sees the change, is  sobered, and quickly turns the chair around. He looks out the window, using his binoculars.
160) 0) text: Jeff lowers the glasses. His look is sober. Lisa stands b him, one hand on the back of the wheelchair. She, too, is serious. THE CAMERA MOVES IN until Lisa's head fills the  screen. She says, slowly:

238) 2) dialog: What about it?
238) 4) dialog: Someone not his wife?
239) 1) dialog: I wonder where he's going now?
239) 3) dialog: Suppose he doesn't come back again?
240) 0) text: Lisa moves toward a nearby lamp.
240) 1) dialog: Well, I guess it's safe to put on  some lights now.

242) 5) dialog: (Nods yes) And you, and you friend Doyle -- (Stops, to Jeff) Did you hear from him again -- since  he left?

242) 11) dialog: Women aren't that unpredictable.
242) 13) text: THE CAMERA CLOSES IN, Lisa stops, faces him. Her eyes spa and her body is tense with concentration.
242) 14) dialog: A woman has a favorite handbag -- it  always hangs on her bedpost where  she can get at it. Then she takes a  trip and leaves it behind. Why?
242) 17) dialog: But only her husband would know that. (Starts to pace again) And the jewelry! Women don't keep  all their jewelry in a purse, all  tangled, getting scratched and twisted  up.
242) 19) dialog: They do not! And they don't leave it  behind them. A woman going anywhere  but the hospital would always take  makeup, perfume and jewelry.
242) 21) dialog: Basic equipment. You don't leave it  behind in your husband's drawer in  your favorite handbag.
242) 23) dialog: That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem  yesterday with her husband?
242) 25) dialog: Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr.  Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs.  Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
242) 27) dialog: We'll agree they saw a woman -- but  she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That  is, yet.
242) 31) dialog: I'd like to see your friend's face  when we tell him. He doesn't sound  like much of a detective.
242) 33) dialog: (Nuzzling Jeff) Don't rush me. We have all night.
242) 36) dialog: Night. I'm going to stay with you.

242) 49) dialog: (Starting to open it) A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway.  Compact, but ample enough.
242) 51) dialog: I'll trade you -- my feminine  intuition for a bed for the night.
242) 54) dialog: There's that song again.
244) 0) text: Lisa stands, listening, entranced.
244) 1) dialog: Where does a man get the inspiration  for a song like that?
244) 4) dialog: It's utterly beautiful. (Turns to Jeff) I wish I could be creative.
244) 6) dialog: (Happily) I do?
244) 9) dialog: Surprise -- is the most important  element of attack. (She smiles) And beside, you're not up on your  private eye literature. When they're  in trouble, it's always their Girl  Friday who gets them out of it.
244) 11) dialog: The same.
244) 13) dialog: (Stands up; deadpan) Weird. (She does a complete  spin, then,  ingenuously) Why don't I slip into something  comfortable?
244) 15) dialog: Exactly what I had in mind -- along  with some brandy.
246) 3) text: Doyle reaches for a cigarette on the table, and puts it t his lips. While searching his pockets for a match, he HEA Lisa humming. His eyes turn upward.

273) 0) text: Doyle, with a studied, gracious gesture, to Lisa.

296) 8) dialog: You and me with long faces -- plunged  into despair -- because we find out  that a man didn't kill his wife.  We're two of the most frightening  ghouls I've ever known.
