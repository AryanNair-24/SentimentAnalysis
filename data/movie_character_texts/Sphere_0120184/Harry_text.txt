11) 7) dialog: Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
15) 0) text: Norman steps down the ladder into the sub compartment.  S circle area: Ted, Beth, Harry, and Arthur.  Ahead of them Barnes sits with the pilot in the sub's cockpit, separate of plexiglass. Norman takes a seat between Beth and Ted.
15) 2) text: Our descent will take 13 minutes. Descending at a speed of 80 feet per minute. Across from Norman, Harry is WHISPERING something quietly Arthur's ear.
15) 24) dialog: How are you feeling, Norman?
15) 26) dialog: You holding up alright?
15) 28) dialog: Don't be defensive.
15) 30) dialog: You sound defensive.
15) 34) dialog: To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
15) 36) dialog: Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake. Norman looks over at Beth.
15) 37) dialog: She told me what you said, Norman.
15) 39) dialog: Just one of Norman's many secrets. ON NORMAN, saying nothing.
20) 16) dialog: Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
20) 18) dialog: For who?  The fish?
21) 4) dialog: You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman? They all look over at him.

22) 7) dialog: C'mon.
22) 10) dialog: C'mon, Norman.
22) 14) dialog: The switch is on your waist. ON NORMAN -- his GLOVE -- fumbling at his waist. HIS HELMET LIGHT -- FLICKERS on. ON NORMAN -- slowly, beginning to walk on the ocean floor HIS FEET -- squashing gently, lightly into the muddy grou NORMAN'S POV -- can barely make out the others in front o helmet lights STROBING the dark water, crossing each othe searchlights on a foggy night.

24) 14) dialog: Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
24) 16) dialog: I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?
24) 18) dialog: Then how can it be chipped? ON BETH -- she touches the door with her palms, feels aro
25) 15) dialog: You'd have to ask them. They approach a DOOR, at the end of the catwalk.
25) 26) text: What the hell? Very softly, Harry begins to laugh.
25) 28) dialog: That's right. Norman looks up and SEES more of the room as his light SH throughout it: TABLES, COUCHES and CHAIRS -- made of leat comfortable looking. They begin to slowly wander about... 
25) 31) dialog: You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
25) 33) dialog: A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
25) 35) dialog: Is it? Beth touches the table, it's metal, but it's soft and rub
25) 37) dialog: Think about it.
25) 43) dialog: All the facts you need are right in front of you.
25) 45) dialog: Do you?
25) 47) dialog: Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
25) 49) dialog: (beat)
25) 52) dialog: It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
25) 55) dialog: The chip in the door. ON NORMAN -- glancing up at Harry... 
25) 56) dialog: We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
25) 58) dialog: Meaning it didn't land in the water.
25) 60) dialog: It didn't fly here.  It arrived here.
25) 62) dialog: Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From our future. A quiet moment as they take this in.
26) 6) dialog: A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power. ON NORMAN -- as he sits down in one of the CHAIRS.
26) 14) dialog: Nice work, Norman.
26) 20) dialog: A flight recorder.  Our future is about to be seen in our present. ON THE SCREEN as it changes:
26) 29) dialog: Unknown Entry Event. Harry pauses, looks down, and punches more keys...  ON THE SCREEN -- as it expands in size, widens around the WE SEE a galaxy of stars, planets coming OFF THE SCREEN, room, becoming three dimensional, suspended in air, givin illusion of depth. The IMAGE begins streaking outward, TOWARD US, moving rap we're flying through it. The stars and other space matter streaking by.
26) 31) dialog: Our answer.
26) 33) dialog: Time travel.  A black hole. The CLUSTER of stars grows brighter and brighter, as it c and closer, brightening. The FIELD twists and turns as the SCREEN and FIELD become WE ENTER the cluster, the black hole. ON NORMAN -- his face, bright, FRIGHTENED as he HEARS:
26) 34) dialog: Ted?  Captain?
26) 36) dialog: We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
27) 1) dialog: This answers one of our questions.
27) 3) dialog: This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This...  sphere.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
27) 5) dialog: Our present.
27) 10) dialog: Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves. ON THE RED GROOVES -- engraved into the surface.
27) 11) dialog: No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
27) 13) dialog: To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
29) 2) dialog: Ted seems to have some ideas. ON THE MONITOR -- Ted pushing on the SPHERE door.  Bangin his shoulder.
29) 6) dialog: (nodding to Norman)
29) 10) dialog: Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
29) 12) dialog: It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
29) 14) dialog: Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
29) 22) dialog: And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
29) 25) dialog: It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
29) 27) dialog: Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
29) 31) dialog: Produce radioactive waste and disintegrate us into nothing.
31) 0) text: Harry on his bunk, staring at the wall, flicking his midd his cheek: THWAP... THWAP.
31) 1) dialog: You realize, Norman, that we are all going to die. Norman is lying in his own bunk, below Harry.
31) 3) dialog: I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
31) 5) dialog: A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
31) 7) dialog: On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
31) 9) dialog: So, we know. (beat)
31) 13) dialog: Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone. Norman gets out of his bed.
31) 15) dialog: Gimme another explanation. Norman pacing.
31) 17) dialog: Am I?
31) 19) dialog: You mean, you think I'm cracking?
31) 21) dialog: Then what, Norman? Norman stops pacing, a beat.
31) 23) dialog: Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
32) 3) dialog: When did it happen?
32) 6) dialog: (to himself)
32) 7) text: I'd sure like to open it and see. ON HARRY -- those cold, intelligent eyes.
35) 0) text: ON NORMAN -- gathering his things.  Stuffing his shotty d Beth, at her bunk, doing the same. Norman stands up.  Looks at the bunk above him: unpacked unpacked belongings, a notebook lying there saying: PROPE HARRY ADAMS. ON NORMAN -- panicking, looking around for Harry.
37) 2) dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen... 
37) 4) dialog: Please watch your closest monitor...  Barnes turns...  ON HIS MONITOR -- Harry, in jumpsuit and helmet, stands i SPHERE. Barnes quickly puts on his headset mic... 
38) 4) text: Harry?  Can you copy? ON THE MONITOR -- Harry, before the SPHERE... 
38) 5) dialog: Pay close attention.  I think you will find this of interest. The sphere DOOR slowly opens.
51) 0) text: Barnes, squinting at Harry on his monitor.
57) 0) text: ON HARRY -- lying still, face down under the sphere.  Goe Checks Harry's LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.  Still blinking -- he' Norman, pauses, looks up, staring at... 
60) 0) text: Barnes speaks to the team (minus Harry and Norman)... 
61) 2) dialog: What is that?  That noise?
61) 4) dialog: It's like...  ANGLE ON Norman's pen -- as he stops writing, the NOISE s Harry sighs.  Norman looks down at his pen.
61) 6) dialog: What are you still doing here?
61) 8) dialog: You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.
61) 10) dialog: You don't understand about the sphere.
61) 12) dialog: Norman?
61) 14) dialog: What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
61) 16) dialog: I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
61) 18) dialog: You shouldn't be here, Norman.  It's too dangerous for you and the others to be down here.
64) 0) text: Harry is eating at a table, seems more relaxed.  The team around him, eating too.  Beth, cold.  Harry sprinkles sal of food in the middle.
64) 2) dialog: Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
64) 6) dialog: What are they?
67) 0) text: Harry, on his bunk with decoding papers in his hands, tur entering the room.
67) 2) dialog: There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
67) 4) text: Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
67) 5) dialog: Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
67) 7) dialog: Did I?
67) 9) dialog: I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine. (beat)
68) 11) dialog: Why?  Does someone else want to go inside?
74) 31) dialog: It's the same as before, but the spacing's different now.  It's definitely nonrandom.  See...  Harry sitting at the monitor, shows Ted, Barnes, Norman, PRINTOUT of the screan -- indicating a pattern.
74) 32) dialog: It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
74) 38) dialog: Well, if it's a discharge --
74) 42) dialog: If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
75) 19) dialog: ... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
75) 22) dialog: Codes are for hiding information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it... 
75) 24) dialog: ... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
75) 26) dialog: I have to tell you.  It's strange.
75) 28) dialog: "Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What is your name?  My name is Jerry."
76) 10) dialog: (on the keyboard, typing)
76) 14) dialog: Okay, Jerry's talking. Harry types -- "0002921 301321 0613182108142232"
76) 16) dialog: "We are friends".
76) 19) dialog: "Yes".  Good.  Now let's see if it'll switch over to English letters. "0032125252632 = Hello" Reply: "0032125252632 = Hello"
76) 22) dialog: (typing)
76) 28) dialog: It's not ignorant.
76) 32) dialog: He understands me fine. Harry types: "Yes" Reply:
76) 41) dialog: She's not gonna know, sir.
76) 43) text: Ask him.  C'mon.  Say something. Harry types: "We are.  Who are you?" Reply: "We are"
76) 47) dialog: He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
76) 50) dialog: What -- you want me to retype it? Harry: "Who are you?" "I am one" "Where are you from?" "I am here" "Where is the location from where you began?"
76) 76) dialog: She's not gonna know.
76) 78) dialog: If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
76) 82) dialog: It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
84) 0) text: Harry, alone, stares at THE FETUS on the table.
