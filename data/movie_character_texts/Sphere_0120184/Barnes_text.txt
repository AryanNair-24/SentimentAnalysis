7) 1) dialog: Dr. Norman Johnson.  Welcome aboard. They shake hands.
7) 3) dialog: Captain.
7) 6) dialog: Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
7) 8) text: The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington. Norman tries to laugh as Barnes ushers him to the door...

8) 3) dialog: Anything else?
8) 7) dialog: You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
8) 9) dialog: Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.

9) 9) dialog: Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
9) 11) dialog: What?
9) 13) dialog: What crashed wasn't an airplane, Dr. Johnson.  It's a bit larger than that. Barnes walks toward a TECHNICIAN, sitting at a keyboard.
9) 14) dialog: (to technician)
9) 17) dialog: Something like that. (beat)
9) 20) dialog: As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago. A beat.
9) 22) dialog: See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
9) 24) dialog: Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
9) 26) dialog: -- dating the crash at least that old.
9) 28) dialog: Maybe older --
9) 30) dialog: Extraordinary, isn't it?

15) 3) dialog: Pressure adjustments will cause the sub to lurch at times, but don't be alarmed.  It's perfectly normal... Arthur's face drips with sweat, as Harry continues to whi ear.
15) 4) dialog: The sub's interior atmosphere will experience moisture as we descend, and the temperature will drop rapidly.  Just relax and remain seated during the descent. Norman watches Arthur, dripping with sweat.
15) 5) dialog: We have clearing from the base. Red interior lights flicker on in the compartment, and WE make a HISSING sound.  The sub lurches, and begins to low water.

20) 4) dialog: Can you open that panel?
20) 8) dialog: Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction. ON THE MONITOR -- another robotic arm extends out, with a sucker.  It pushes against the panel, but doesn't suck.
20) 10) dialog: Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
20) 12) dialog: Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
20) 14) dialog: What about a crowbar?
20) 20) dialog: Or whatever's in that thing. ON THE MONITOR -- the spacecraft, sitting there silently, at them.
20) 21) dialog: Norman, what do you think? Norman, quiet in the corner, perks up...
21) 2) dialog: Nothing to be nervous about.  These suits are wired and electrically heated.  Each equipped with an alarm that triggers automatically if life- support sustems go below optimum. Norman holds his jumpsuit out and away from him, like it' nuclear.
