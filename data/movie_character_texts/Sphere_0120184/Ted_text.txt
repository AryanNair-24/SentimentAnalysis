19) 6) dialog: Robot?  What robot?
20) 2) dialog: Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
20) 6) dialog: I'd like it noted in the report that I think we should be doing this ourselves.  Making a manned entry... The claw is clumsy, and keeps banging into the metal.
20) 7) dialog: I'd also like it noted --
20) 13) dialog: What about a crowbar? Barnes straightens up, looks at Ted...
20) 15) dialog: What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
20) 24) dialog: I'm secure enough with that.

25) 19) dialog: Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.
25) 21) dialog: Still, make a note I recognized that. ON BARNES -- leading them through a small hall.  It seems up into some sort of room -- when Barnes stops.  Dead in

25) 25) dialog: (softly)
25) 27) dialog: English?
25) 30) dialog: It doesn't make any sense.
25) 32) dialog: Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
25) 34) dialog: But it's impossible.
25) 36) dialog: Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
25) 38) dialog: Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
25) 41) dialog: Well, what's your theory?
25) 44) dialog: Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
25) 46) dialog: If it is an alien spacecraft --
25) 51) dialog: An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
25) 54) dialog: Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
25) 57) dialog: Meaning?

25) 61) dialog: Arrived?  From where?
26) 0) text: Ted and Barnes trek through a vast cargo bay, like two an flashlights.
26) 1) dialog: Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
26) 3) dialog: Maybe we didn't want to come back.
27) 7) dialog: Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here. ANGLE ON THE SPHERE -- some dark red MARKINGS on it's sur

38) 0) text: Edmunds, Norman, Beth, Ted staring at the monitor... 
38) 1) dialog: I thought he was with you, Norman. Through the speakers...

68) 4) dialog: She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
74) 20) text: You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy." ON NORMAN -- sweating.
74) 34) dialog: Maybe it's a message?
74) 36) dialog: The sphere.  Maybe the sphere --
74) 39) dialog: It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
74) 41) dialog: What's inside the sphere.
74) 43) dialog: Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
75) 0) text: Ted, nervous, anxious -- with five or six printouts in hi Norman's ear in front of the sink... 
75) 1) dialog: He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
75) 3) dialog: It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
75) 5) dialog: Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light. (Norman does)
75) 8) dialog: Squint harder.
75) 10) dialog: (hands him another printout)
75) 13) dialog: Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
75) 15) dialog: Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know? ON NORMAN -- Ted's lost it.
75) 17) dialog: Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
75) 20) dialog: (to Norman)
76) 8) dialog: Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
76) 15) dialog: What'd you say?
76) 21) dialog: Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
76) 23) text: Good idea, Ted.
76) 24) dialog: (confused)

76) 38) dialog: He doesn't wait for an answer.
76) 42) dialog: (to Harry)
76) 45) dialog: We have to teach him plurals? Harry: "No" "You are a many entity?" "No.  We are many separate entities." "I understand.  Is there one control entity?"
76) 51) dialog: "From where you began?" That's not even good English. "I am from AWARENESS"
76) 57) dialog: You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
76) 75) text: Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
76) 80) dialog: Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
76) 86) dialog: Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
76) 88) dialog: Why's that?
78) 0) text: Barnes at the monitors, Ted with him. PONG.  PONG.  PONG.
