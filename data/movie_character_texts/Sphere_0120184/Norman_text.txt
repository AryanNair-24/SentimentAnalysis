76) 2) dialog: The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
76) 34) dialog: Well, he's polite.
76) 54) dialog: That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
76) 56) dialog: I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.

76) 91) dialog: Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional... 
76) 93) dialog: ... it raises a very serious question: What happens if Jerry gets mad?

83) 4) dialog: Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
83) 6) dialog: Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
83) 8) dialog: Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
83) 14) dialog: Jerry, we don't want to ignore you. "Don't underestimate my power"
