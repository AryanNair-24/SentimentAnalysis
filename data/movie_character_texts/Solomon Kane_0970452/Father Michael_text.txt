60) 9) dialog: Every foul thing that the light of Christ kept at bay is returning. We have burned so many witches and their familiars but still they keep coming. One of them cursed my flock with her evil, turning them into terrible ghoulish creatures.
60) 11) dialog: Did you hurt them?
60) 13) dialog: They are innocent of their crimes. I have watched men become monsters before my eyes. They slaughter each other; fathers killing their children, brother murdering brother. Such a hunger is in them. This is truly the end of days.
60) 15) dialog: I believe that God is testing my faith.
60) 17) dialog: Mind your blasphemy! It’s as God wants it. He wants to feel our love for him even through our agony. Kane gets to his feet and paces angrily.

60) 29) dialog: No! They are my flock and I have a duty of care towards them. I... keep them. I... care for them. I... feed them. Kane is horrified.

Kane TUMBLES BACK DOWN INTO THE PIT. The Priest dashes forward and slams the cellar door close on the snarling, screeching pack of ghouls.

95) 23) dialog: He has a life still; if you can call it life.
95) 25) dialog: He was so badly injured by the fall but he did not die. Alive in a way; his body did not die but his mind, his soul, were lost and no surgeons or priests could help. And so... so... I brought the sorcerer here.
95) 27) dialog: I sought him out and he came with promises of power and healing. I offered him everything I had, just to bring Marcus back to me. I couldn’t lose both my sons. The old man takes a pause now. He hardly has the strength to continue. Solomon Kane by Michael J. Bassett 104 Kane can hear the noise outside growing. Fleeing prisoner and the shouts of guards. He knows time is running out.
95) 28) dialog: And he did Solomon; Using his mirrors and magic, Malachi reached into the darkness and brought Marcus back. But he was changed; he had such darkness, such violence and power. He spoke using others possessing them, forcing them to his way. His face was so damaged by the fall; he hid himself behind his mask and served only the will of the sorcerer. For all these years we lived in fear of him and Malachi.
95) 30) dialog: Aye; That creature is Marcus or once was. I don’t believe there is anything of my son there now. It is a demon wearing the flesh of your brother, nothing more.
