The STABLE KEEPER is nearby him, unconscious and bloody - already pinned to the wood. OTHERS too are lined up; anyo who might have been involved with them is being crucified in the town square. TELFORD is not there though. A PARTY of RAIDERS and LOCALS are raising the crosses. Th market square has been trashed, any stalls that were left have been shattered, others are burning. The silent OVERLORD watches from his horse as the first o the crosses are raised. The cries of pain are unbearable. The TOWN LOCALS have been herded into a group. Raiders wi their weapons ready face them but no one is going to figh A POSSESSED RAIDER speaks with his MASTER’S VOICE. It echoes unnaturally across the town square.
