Sam looks up, face etched in sudd TERROR. *No time to think*. SWERVES, no dice...! BROADSID the animal -- And it comes THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. All two hundred and  fifteen pounds of it. Fucks up their night altogether.  Actually, it only makes it *halfway* through -- But the damn thing is ALIVE. More than alive. KICKING.  Thrashing. Squawling with pain and rage.

Swallows her, leaves a silhouet Around her, trees catch fire. Burn. She lies in her impro sarcophagus. Out of sight. THE FLAMING DEER totters from the wreck, thrashing. Scene from a nightmare.

The car's an inferno. Earl is dead. She turns away, wipin blood from her eyes -- Comes face to face with a SNOWMAN. A jolly white fellow. Charcoal briquettes for eyes. She  watches, fascinated, as he MELTS in the blast furnace hea With warning, she *screams*. Crumples to the ground. The snowman's eyes fall out. He melts away and away...

A photo of Hal and Caitlin. He pockets it, disturbed. Crosses to the bathroom door. T shower has stopped. Raises a tentative hand, starts to  knock... It OPENS. There, in a thin silk robe, is a WOMAN swabbing at her hair. She breezes out of the bathroom all chipper, like nothing unusual. Notices Henessey cursorily. Raises a finger: "on sec."
