61) 1) dialog: This can't happen, Harry. The  President's already up at night,  prowling his sock drawer for double  agents, and now we've got a fucking  rogue on our hands.
61) 3) dialog: Oh, for the love of Christ, who can  be so fucking important?
61) 4) text: He throws open a door off the passage: THERE'S TIMOTHY.  Perched on the edge of a conference table, tamping a pack smokes. Perkins reacts, stunned.

61) 22) dialog: Charly, you're being paranoid. It's  not like it used to be, you're eight  years out of date.
61) 24) dialog: Congress won't authorize a dime,  Charly. Chapter's on the way out,  we've been reduced to a records- keeping agency, we *don't have enough  money to kill you*, understand...?

Crosses to the bed, throws back the covers -- MR. PERKINS (the stuffed bear) has the chain around his neck. We hear it, then. Ghosting on the still air, barely audib the sound of SINGING... Children's voices waft across the frozen pond from St. Paul's Episcopal CHURCH. Charly frow Crosses to the window, lifts the sash. Pause. Charly chews her lip. Unlimbers the MP-5. Hefts th wicked-looking thing. Not to fire it... but to use the SC Adjusts focus. Practiced movements. Deft. Sure. Sights do the weapon. Scans though the gunsights... POV CHARLY: Hal's CHRISTMAS PAGEANT. There's Hal. Cast in spectral GREEN. Laughing and serving breakfast. On the ch lawn, a NATIVITY scene. Teenage girls as the wise men. Ch of children, singing... CAITLIN among them. Charly is sweating. She lowers the scope. Squeezes her ey shut. Something in her, threatening to WRENCH LOOSE...

94) 2) dialog: You know, Colonel, you ought really  to have stayed dead. You don't know  the rules of the game anymore.
94) 5) dialog: Budget cuts, remember? Congress  blinded us in Eastern Europe, Central  America. Across the board, an  intelligence blackout. We had to  recruit any eyes and ears we could  find, even if it meant going to former  targets.
94) 10) dialog: Interesting theory.
94) 12) text: Perkins shrugs philosophically.
94) 13) dialog: It's not without precedent. 1993,  remember the World Trade Center  bombing...? The CIA had advance  knowledge, don't think they didn't.  Worse, the diplomat who issued the  terrorist's visa was CIA, they  *facilitated* the bombing. Purely to  justify a budget increase. Of course,  they'd no way of knowing the  terrorists would botch the job.
