64) 2) text: Just now.  Not... fifteen minutes  ago. The door to the Tides opens and MRS. BUNDY, sixtyish, wea walking shoes and a tweed suit, a very masculine-looking  woman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes thr foreground, goes to bar, her attention slowly caught by w Melanie is saying.
64) 6) text: Help you, Mrs. Bundy?
64) 7) dialog: I need some change, Mr. Carter. As Deke opens cash register...
64) 9) text: Could you turn that down, please? Deke gives Mrs. Bundy her change, turns off television.
64) 12) dialog: (turning from machine)
64) 19) text: I don't know when. I simply can't  leave now. Tell Mother not to worry.   All right, Daddy, good-by. She hangs up. Mrs. Bundy is at her elbow.
64) 20) dialog: They're both perching birds, of  course, but of quite different  species. The crow is brachyrhynchos.  The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
64) 25) text: I don't see what difference it makes,  Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If  they attacked the school, that's  pretty serious.
64) 26) dialog: (with a superior smile)
64) 30) dialog: Birds are not aggressive creatures,  Miss. They bring beauty to the world.  It is mankind, rather, who...
64) 36) dialog: (continuing to Deke)
64) 39) dialog: Impossible.
64) 56) dialog: (laughing)
64) 63) dialog: The crow is a permanent resident  throughout its range. In fact, during  our Christmas Count, we recorded...
64) 68) dialog: Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are  several varieties.
64) 70) dialog: Probably herring gulls. They arrive  in November, you know, and don't  migrate North again until March or...
64) 94) dialog: The gulls were after your fish, Mr.   Sholes. Really, let's be logical  about this.
64) 96) dialog: What do you think they were after,  Miss...?
64) 98) dialog: For what purpose?
64) 101) dialog: Why? Another silence.
64) 103) dialog: I thought not. Birds have been on  this planet since archaeopteryx,  Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty  million years ago! A TRAVELING SALESMAN ENTERS, goes to bar, listens.
64) 104) dialog: Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait  all that time to start a... a war  against humanity?
64) 107) dialog: You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying  as much.
64) 117) dialog: (outraged)
64) 120) dialog: We need them.
64) 122) dialog: They are incapable of organized  warfare!
64) 124) dialog: I have seen jays doing everything it  is conceivable for jays to do.   Ornithology happens to be my  avocation, Miss Daniels. You're  talking about preservation of the  species, a hen protecting her young.   There's a vast difference between...
64) 126) dialog: Are you discussing gamebirds now?   All birds are not gamebirds, you  know.
64) 129) dialog: That would hardly be possible.
64) 131) dialog: Because there are 8,650 species of  birds in the world today, Mr. Carter.  It's estimated that five billion,  seven hundred and fifty million birds  live in the United States alone. The  five continents of the world...
64) 134) dialog: ...probably contain more than a  hundred billion birds!
64) 145) dialog: Of course.
64) 147) dialog: Of course it does. If we believe  that birds are attacking, why... why  next we'll believe that grasshoppers  and cockroaches are capable of...
64) 154) dialog: And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
64) 156) dialog: Yes. I have never known birds of  different species to flock together.   The very concept is unimaginable. (laughing)
64) 168) dialog: We're fighting a war, Sam.
64) 199) dialog: What are the facts, Mr. Malone?
64) 210) dialog: That's right, sir, I recall it. A  large flock of seagulls got lost in  a fog and headed in for the town,  where all the lights were.
64) 213) dialog: The point is that no one seemed to  get upset about it. They were gone  the next morning, just as if nothing  at all had happened. Poor things.
64) 226) dialog: (sarcastically)
64) 230) dialog: Ridiculous!
64) 258) dialog: Birds are not bad!
74) 2) text: It is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs Bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and  helpless. Mrs. Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters s words.
74) 3) dialog: ([Mrs. Bundy offers a  weak explanation of  why the birds could  have gone berserk  like this. This  information should  be obtained from Dr.  Stager.])
