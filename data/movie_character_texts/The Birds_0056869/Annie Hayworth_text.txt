7) 27) dialog: (laughing)
7) 30) dialog: San Francisco.
7) 32) dialog: Oh, someone invited me up for the  weekend a long time ago. There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.
7) 33) dialog: Look, I see no reason for being coy  about this. It was Mitch Brenner. Melanie nods.

7) 63) dialog: Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch  the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
7) 65) dialog: No, I don't think so. She's not afraid  of losing her son, you see.  She's  only afraid of being abandoned.
7) 67) dialog: She already has a daughter.
7) 69) dialog: (apologetically)
7) 72) dialog: So it ended. Not immediately, of  course. I went back to San Francisco,  and I still saw Mitch every now and  then... but we both knew it was  finished.
7) 74) dialog: You get straight to the point, don't  you?
7) 76) dialog: No, that's all right, I don't mind.   I came up here for two reasons. To  begin with, I was bored with my job  in San Francisco. I was teaching at  a private school there... well, you  know, you probably went to one  yourself.
7) 78) dialog: Then you know. Little girls in brown  beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life.  I'll go into that classroom on Monday  morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each  of them will be saying, 'Yes, please  give me what you have.' (pause)
