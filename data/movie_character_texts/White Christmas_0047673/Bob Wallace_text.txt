You'll have to cancel us  off the Ed Harrison Show...  Oscar,  remember your blood pressure.   Incidentally, how much will this  cost?

7) 50) dialog: The company's been getting a little  ragged.  We'd appreciate the use of  the hall.
7) 52) dialog: We'll pay a little, but not much. - You see, the audience will be guinea- pigs -- and for us, that's quite an  improvement.
7) 56) dialog: I hope this is not an indication of  advancing age, getting kissed out of  gratitude.
7) 58) dialog: A body keeps hoping.
7) 59) text: Betty steps up to him and gives him the biggest smack. Bob is quite surprised.
7) 61) dialog: It was still gratitude.

9) 7) dialog: Little young for that, aren't you?
9) 8) text: He gets up and goes to the refrigerator.  His preoccupati with the food will permit Betty's expression to be more  obvious than her lines, which are spoken to tell the audi of her regard for Bob,  since their significance must esc him.
9) 9) dialog: What shall I make you?
9) 11) dialog: If you tell me what you want to dream  about I'll know what to make you.
9) 13) dialog: Different foods make for different  dreams.  I've got a whole theory  about it.  It's called "The Wallace  Way of Wishful Wooing."  You'll find  it in the American Medical Journal  under 'W'.  Ham and Swiss cheese,  for instance, you get a cool, thin,  blonde girl.  Turkey sandwich, you  get a dark sort of stumpy girl, sexy  though.  Now a liverwurst sandwich - (He shakes his head) you get both girls at once.  Bad  night.
9) 15) dialog: Darndest thing, I dream about me.
9) 17) text: Bob doesn't get the significance of what she has said.
9) 18) dialog: Now that's very flattering.  Tuna  coming up. (He is occupied at  the frigidaire while  she watches him  yearningly) Let me make you some warm milk.   That'll help the insomnia.
9) 20) dialog: Whatever you've got on your mind  isn't worth staying awake for.
9) 23) dialog: Would you like to know how I handle  a situation like that...?
9) 25) text: Bob begins to sing COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS, as he prepares t warm milk and hands it to her.  She drinks it down.  As h reaches the second chorus, he starts to dim the lamp on t table,  Betty, pretending to be sleepy, leans her head to Bob.

She waits, eyes closed, expectan But Bob gets to his feet, and carefully tiptoes to the do and exits, closing it softly behind him.  After a moment, Betty snaps on the light, throws the pillow on the floor, and rests her chin in her hand, disappointed and wide awa
9) 30) dialog: All right kids!  Places!  Let's get  going! Phil, you're on!
9) 31) text: Phil reacts. Bob crosses to his stage manager station, which is a desk and high chair, where Albert is seated, not far from his  wife, Sylvia, who is sipping a glass of water.  Albert ho a stop watch and evidently helps in the administration.

9) 138) text: The General smiles; Betty waves a farewell to him and cro to the train, starting up the steps.  The notion behind t scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue du to the whistle, bells, and escaping steam.  The manner of playing, though, indicates the sentiment.  To emphasize i Bob is fonder of Betty than he realizes, and Betty fully  realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not retu consciously, her affection.  We hear Betty:
9) 140) dialog: She can take care of herself.  Worry  about the menfolk.  Now don't forget  to write.
9) 142) text: Not all of this is heard, since the sound effects pick th spots, but the attention is on the General, who is watchi the scene with a whimsical look.  He, as does the audienc realizes Bob's true feelings.  As the train starts to lea Betty and Bob shake hands.  She holds his handshake a lit longer than necessary, and Bob is forced to move along wi the train.  Finally she releases him, and Bob looks after the train, puzzled.
9) 143) text: THE CAMERA is now on the train platform, Bob out of sight Betty wipes away a tear.  In the background we see the Ge in the buggy noticing this.
9) 146) dialog: The idea's never occurred to me,  sir.
9) 148) dialog: Not interested!
9) 150) dialog: It's a little immodest to say so,  but I consider myself an authority  on the fair sex,  I've made a study  of the subject.  They're simple  creatures.

9) 154) dialog: 'Who knows his own strength is twice  armed.'
9) 156) dialog: (Not willing to admit  it) She has a job in The Carousel.

9) 170) dialog: I don't get it.
9) 172) dialog: I just don't see it.  You' re skinny,  you got a big nose, and you squint.
9) 174) dialog: Yes, you!  Nothing personal though.
9) 176) dialog: I'm just trying to figure out what  anyone sees in you.

10) 11) dialog: Yes, sir. (Still trying) Still, weather's a funny thing. It could snow - overnight.
10) 13) dialog: Really, sir? That's great news!
10) 15) dialog: Where are you going to be sent, sir?
10) 17) dialog: No, sir.
10) 19) dialog: (Remembering) Oh, I beg your pardon, sir. (He pulls the letter  out of his pocket) That's what I came over to give you,  it slipped my mind.
10) 22) dialog: (Reading) Dear Tom: Why, you dirty, old - (He stops)
10) 24) dialog: Yes, sir. (Continuing) It certainly was a surprise hearing  from you.  Your amusing letter was  appreciated more than you imagine.   Of course you've got plenty of time  to be amusing, sitting on that porch,  rocking away, while we put in a full  day's work.  You always were a lucky  stiff, and I envy you.  A few years  more, I was saying to Emmy the other  evening, and I'm going to be able to  take it easy like old Tom.
10) 26) dialog: Oh, well, some people have all the  luck.  Everyone in the family is  fine here.  Carol had the mumps,  which is no joke at eleven years of  age -

10) 42) dialog: I told you what I'm seein' Ed Harrison  about.  That's all.
