0) 453) text: However, the AUDIENCE - a few PASSERS-BY and DRINKERS who have drifted out of the pub for a smoke - aren't much interested in ANTON. Instead they pay more attention to t masked TONY who, decked out in a stylish costume, is work the sparse crowd with his smooth charm. ANTON, irritated, glances back at DOCTOR PARNASSUS who is worried about the lack of customers. TONY is now surrounded by fascinated WOMEN. They laugh at of his jokes. One pretty young woman, SALLY, in particula seems to be smitten by the handsome `actor'. TONY smiles seductively at her. The sight provokes ANTON. He leaps off the stage, grabs S by the wrist and begins to pull her to the stage. PERCY keeps playing.

0) 564) dialog: Well, sir, I've been thinking... It's clear the show's not attracting many people. Forgive me but... I see two ways of tackling this problem.
0) 569) dialog: Either the style of the show is at fault... or the type of audience. I would suggest changing both. PERCY has appeared, dragging a damaged flat.
0) 572) dialog: I'm sorry but.. you're not modern. People want modern. Look. He holds open a tattered fashion magazine to a page of beautifully photographed models in a fabulously magical setting. He thumbs through more pages of dreamy images.

0) 576) dialog: (puzzled)
0) 579) dialog: There'll be a better class of police too.
0) 584) dialog: The trick is not to hide. Change your colours. Be bold. Go where they would least expect to find you. I think we have been brought together for a reason. I don't believe in coincidence. You saved my life. Now let me do something in return. PARNASSUS confers with PERCY.
0) 586) dialog: (to Valentina)
0) 592) dialog: Well... First of all, I want you to give me your money. All of it. What?!   PARNASSUS, PERCY, and VALENTINA look at each oth Then PARNASSUS sees something beyond the wagon...ANTON, downcast, heading off through the swirling plastic bags a flying rubbish... a battered suitcase in his hand.
0) 606) dialog: (retrieving the money) Excuse me, madam. I'm afraid we can't accept this.
0) 607) text: The woman stops, confused. Tony hands her back her money.

I can see you have a generous spirit.
0) 609) text: TONY returns to his pensive pose.    The women look at ea other.
0) 614) dialog: Cost? Money is no good in the Imaginarium.   This is a refuge for hearts in need of truth. A place for souls to be purified.
0) 616) dialog: Madam, why should you care about time? What are your dreams worth in minutes? The women grow pensive.

0) 619) text: ...despair at your inability to do anything to change it.. to make it better...I despaired so much at the powerlessness of my own existence that I took the easy way out...the coward's way...I committed suicide! Yes, that's right, I killed myself. Can you understand my despair? But I was saved...saved by a miracle...The Imaginarium...and Doctor Parnassus. He brought me back from the dead. He gave me a new life. A reason to live. He has given me power to dream again... to dream of a better world. During his speech, more and more people have gathered. So are actually weeping. They are press forward putting mone in the plinth. Tony tries to stop them but, they insist. VALENTINA, ANTON, PERCY, and DR. PARNASSUS are astonished TONY'S performance.
0) 624) dialog: Please, I'm sorry but, we're booked solid at the moment. A Louis Vuitton-dressed woman (60+ years old)at the back the crowd shouts:

0) 638) dialog: Believe me Madam, you're the luckiest woman in the world. The LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN steps into the mirror. TONY hesitates..a moment of uncertainty. VALENTINA encourages with a smile. He steps through. Across the street a clock begins striking the hour. CUT TO the two POLICE OFFICERS who start to move the crow and show on.

Below them a gondola rests in the stream as small, flower bedecked barques float past with framed pictures of roman heroes who died young; Keats, Shelly, Byron, James Dean, Rudolph Valentino, Marilyn Monroe, Buddy Holly, Princess Diana... the stream continues off into the distance to a dark, towering Egyptian pyramid. TONY is as bemused as THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN.
0) 661) dialog: You must make a choice...and... actually, to be honest, I'd strongly recommend this one.
0) 663) dialog: (thinking fast)
0) 667) dialog: There's not a moment to lose. But as she hesitates a dark shadow rises over them. TONY, looking past the WOMAN"S shoulder, sees the dark waters o the stream rise up transforming into a GIGANTIC KING COBR that towers menacingly over them. It's wearing a BOWLER HAT... and it's angry.
0) 671) dialog: But your sacrifice must be pure. You have to let go of all these worldly goods. He helps THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN remove her necklace, earrings, bracelets, rings, broach, in double quick time guides her onto the gondola, blowing a kiss after her.

0) 684) text: Born again, tearful but transcendent, the LOUIS VUITTON W produces her cheque book and begins to write a cheque. TONY is frozen, confused. The crowd is still... stunned b the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN's transformation as she deposits cheque, her handbag, her expensive coat in the glass box glides benignly through the crowd... which parts in awe. Pause... and then the other WOMEN rush the stage. Mayhem narrowly averted as TONY and PERCY manage to coral them i a more-or-less orderly queue. Across the street, standing in the doorway of a shop sell luxury goods, is MR NICK. He watches events, intrigued... ...as TONY escorts a second woman through the mirror, and third, they descend, ecstatic, emptying the contents of t handbags, their pearls, earrings and diamond rings into t glass box. TONY pays off the cops who move on. TONY, getting more and more flamboyant, forgets to lower mask each time he re-enters the stage. And now a fourth w descends. Four successes for DOCTOR PARNASSUS.
0) 686) text: DOCTOR PARNASSUS spots MR NICK across the street, smiles, holds up four fingers. MR NICK gives a little `I'm not impressed' smirk and turn away and pretends to be interested in the luxury goods in shop window as four large dark heavy RUSSIAN MEN, all lad with luxury shopping walk past. One of the RUSSIANS stops..looking at the show..at TONY w mask is sitting on top of his head. The leading RUSSIAN pulls him on.
0) 704) text: In the distance, TONY is hiding behind some billowing fab On being spotted, he takes off up a hill. The RUSSIANS race toward the hill only to crash into a so wall - painted as a landscape with TONY frozen in mid str Looking off to their right they see Tony heading up anoth hill. But as they rush in that direction another wall ris up blocking them. Again it is painted with a hill and TON frozen in midstride. A third and fourth wall rise up.. surrounding and trapping the RUSSIANS. There is a cell door in one wall. Like crazy animals they start throwing themselves against the door trying to brea down. It won't budge. While the others batter the door, GREGOR, who has been somewhat affected by the soft shampoo commercial world, s quietly in a corner picking pretty flowers. Exhausted, the other RUSSIANS collapse on the ground. GREGOR gently breathes in the aroma of the flowers and exhales. As he does the door swings open. The other RUSSI gape at him... then barrel out the door. Outside is a new, beautiful, landscape - the sky dotted w white fluffy clouds. Extending from the ground to each cl is an incredibly long ladder. On each ladder is a person climbing upwards. The RUSSIANS spot Tony. He is already a hundred feet up a ladder and climbing. Unfortunately, their way is blocked by an over-bright, hy active, wide-eyed sales girl.
0) 712) dialog: No! Wait! I can explain! Give me a chance!
0) 720) text: Relax. Smell the flowers. Confused, ANTON takes the flower, sniffs and then... GREG floors him with a powerful punch on the nose Meanwhile, the RUSSIANS have a noose around TONY's neck a have looped the rope over a tree branch. TONY struggles t pull out the metal pipe he keeps on a string around his n He gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when... ... the ground erupts and a giant London policeman's helm rises up (we are talking 20 feet tall)and revolves - revealing DR. PARNASSUS' carved and painted face beneath. The mouth drops open and a great red tongue rolls out lik welcoming red carpet. From inside the giant mouth a smili policeman beckons the RUSSIANS to come on in.. The terrified RUSSIANS let go of the lynching rope. TONY drops to the ground and, with a whistle, the brass p flies out of his mouth. Behind the RUSSIANS a painted backdrop unfurls..it reads "JOIN THE FUZZ.. WE LOVE VIOLENCE".. and a chorus line of LONG-LEGGED GIRLS in mini-skirted police outfits appear - high-kicking a snappy song and dance number. The astonished RUSSIANS don't know what the fuck is going Suddenly, a friendly OLD WOMAN'S VOICE is heard shouting something in Russian. Spinning around, the RUSSIANS see an old BABOUSHKA (Russi grandmother) outside a tumble-down cottage waving gaily t them. A stunned pause. Then, pell-mell, they rush to her.

0) 752) dialog: Because they're irredeemably bad people, and I'm essentially good. I know that sounds terribly prim and arrogant and self righteous, but I'm trying to be honest. Look, the truth is... in order to get my charity off the ground I needed capital.
0) 754) dialog: (in response to Anton) Yes, I know, and you're right, but that's the way the grown-up..the real world works. You can't make omelettes without soiling your hands. Or should that be the other way round? Anyway, I - with hindsight very foolishly - accepted a loan from people who seemed to me, at the time, to be very decent and sincere. There was absolutely no way I could have known that they were part of a ruthless organised crime syndicate and that they wanted to use my charity to launder money. I made a mistake. And I have to live with that. I'm sorry. What more can I say?
0) 755) text: VALENTINA wants to believe TONY. ANTON and PERCY don't.

0) 765) dialog: Stop saying that! I didn't steal it! I didn't have it. I'd had to invest in infrastructure. I needed more time. When you run a charity you have to give lots of money away. You wouldn't believe the red tape. The Charity Commission are a bunch of fascists. It's incredible. I mean... c'mon give me a break...I almost died today.. and I said I'm sorry... and anyway..... this was supposed to be a special day...it's Valentina's birthday. He pulls out the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN'S beautiful necklace from his pocket.
