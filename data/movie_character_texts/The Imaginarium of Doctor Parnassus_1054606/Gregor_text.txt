The RUSSIANS race toward the hill only to crash into a so wall - painted as a landscape with TONY frozen in mid str Looking off to their right they see Tony heading up anoth hill. But as they rush in that direction another wall ris up blocking them. Again it is painted with a hill and TON frozen in midstride. A third and fourth wall rise up.. surrounding and trapping the RUSSIANS. There is a cell door in one wall. Like crazy animals they start throwing themselves against the door trying to brea down. It won't budge. While the others batter the door, GREGOR, who has been somewhat affected by the soft shampoo commercial world, s quietly in a corner picking pretty flowers. Exhausted, the other RUSSIANS collapse on the ground. GREGOR gently breathes in the aroma of the flowers and exhales. As he does the door swings open. The other RUSSI gape at him... then barrel out the door. Outside is a new, beautiful, landscape - the sky dotted w white fluffy clouds. Extending from the ground to each cl is an incredibly long ladder. On each ladder is a person climbing upwards. The RUSSIANS spot Tony. He is already a hundred feet up a ladder and climbing. Unfortunately, their way is blocked by an over-bright, hy active, wide-eyed sales girl.
