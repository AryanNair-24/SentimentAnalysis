10) 6) dialog: No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
10) 9) dialog: Really?
10) 12) dialog: Thanks.  I'll think about it. William suddenly spies something odd on the small TV moni beside him.
10) 28) dialog: No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
10) 31) dialog: Yes.
10) 33) dialog: What's your name?
10) 36) dialog: Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
10) 38) dialog: Tempting but... no, thank you. Thief leaves.
10) 39) dialog: I think I will try this one. She hands William a £20 note and the book he said He talks as he handles the transaction.
10) 42) dialog: Thanks. And leaves.  She's out of his life forever.  William is a dazed.  Seconds later Martin comes back in.
13) 0) text: William swings out of the little shop -- he turns the cor Portobello Road and bumps straight into Anna.  The orange juice,  in its foam cup, flies.  It soaks Anna.
13) 1) dialog: Oh Jesus.
13) 3) dialog: What are you doing?! He jumps back.
13) 5) dialog: No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
13) 7) dialog: Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
15) 0) text: William is tidying up frantically.  Then he hears Anna's the stairs.  She walks down, wearing a short, sparkling b top beneath her leather jacket.  With her trainers still is dazzled by the sight of her.
15) 2) dialog: No thanks.
15) 4) dialog: No.
15) 7) dialog: Really, no.
15) 9) dialog: No.
15) 11) dialog: No. (pause) I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
15) 14) dialog: Thank you.
15) 20) dialog: I forgot my bag.
15) 23) dialog: Thanks.  Well... They stand in that corridor -- in that small space.  Seco saying goodbye.  A strange feeling of intimacy.  She lean forward and she kisses him.  Total silence.  A real sense strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his.  The
15) 25) dialog: Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint. Suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.
15) 28) dialog: Hi.
15) 31) dialog: Probably best not tell anyone about this.
15) 33) dialog: Bye. And she leaves, with just a touch of William's hand.  Spi comes out of the kitchen, eating something white out of a styrofoam container with a spoon.
16) 0) text: The lights are off.  William and Spike on the couch, just light from the TV playing on their faces.  Cut to the TV screen.  There is Anna.  She is in a stylish Woody Allen modern romantic comedy, 'Gramercy Park,' in black and whi

17) 4) dialog: I've got nothing to smile about.
25) 10) dialog: Hi. We hear her voice -- don't see her.
25) 12) dialog: You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
25) 14) dialog: Oh -- Okay.
25) 16) dialog: Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
31) 0) text: There Anna is, framed in the window.  Glorious.
31) 2) dialog: Hello.
31) 4) dialog: Oh no, ho -- these are great. A fair amount of tension.  These two people hardly know e other -- and the first and last time they met, they kisse
31) 6) dialog: No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi. At which moment Jeremy, Karen's boss, comes in.  A fairly authoritative fifty-year-old PR man consulting a list.
31) 8) dialog: Yes, thanks.
31) 10) dialog: Is that so? William shrugs his shoulders.  Jeremy settles at a little in the corner and makes notes.  A pause.  William feels h act the part.  They sit in chairs opposite each other.
31) 13) dialog: Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
31) 16) dialog: No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
31) 20) dialog: It takes place on a submarine.
31) 23) dialog: And what happens next in the dream? It's a challenge.
31) 30) dialog: Yes. They look at each other.  Jeremy enters, with another jou in tow.  Anna and William stand and shake hands formally.
31) 31) dialog: Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
37) 1) dialog: Come in. William enters.  A certain nervousness.  They are alone a
37) 2) dialog: Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
37) 4) dialog: Okay -- fine.
37) 6) dialog: No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
37) 8) dialog: If that's all right.
37) 10) dialog: Okay.

40) 11) dialog: Thank you. Door bell goes.
42) 3) dialog: Hiya.
42) 5) dialog: Ahm... I think that sounds -- you know -- lucky me.  Happy Birthday. She hands her a present.

45) 13) dialog: Films mainly.
45) 15) dialog: Fifteen million dollars.
45) 18) dialog: (to Bella) I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
46) 2) dialog: (whispering) I'm a vegetarian.
48) 19) dialog: Wait a minute.  What about me?
48) 21) dialog: Well... a shot at it.
48) 23) dialog: Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
48) 25) dialog: Really -- and one day, not long from now... While she says this, quiet settles around the table.  The is -- she sort of means it and is opening up to them.
48) 26) dialog: ... my looks will go, they'll find out I can't act and I'll become a sad middle-aged woman who looks a bit like someone who was famous for a while. Silence... they all look at her... then.

49) 1) dialog: That was such a great evening.
49) 3) dialog: And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
49) 5) dialog: You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting. Max loves this.

50) 4) dialog: Why is she in a wheelchair?
50) 6) dialog: And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
50) 9) dialog: Too complicated.
50) 11) dialog: Busy tomorrow?
50) 13) dialog: I was.
51) 1) dialog: What's in there? They are now walking by a five foot railing, with foliage behind it.
51) 3) dialog: Let's go in.
51) 5) dialog: You abide by rules like that?
51) 9) dialog: What did you say?
51) 11) dialog: Yes, you did.
51) 13) dialog: You said 'whoopsidaisies.' Tiny pause.
51) 15) dialog: There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
51) 19) dialog: Step aside. She starts to climb.
51) 22) dialog: Come on, Flops. William clambers over with terrible difficulty, dusts him off, and heads towards where she stands.
52) 1) dialog: 'For June, who loved this garden -- from Joseph who always sat beside her.' We cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood.  S doesn't read the dates, carved below -- 'June Wetherby, 1 - 1992.'  She is slightly chocked by it.
52) 2) dialog: Some people do spend their whole lives together. He nods.  They are standing on either side of the bench, looking at each other.  The camera glides away from them, into the night sky, leaving them alone in the garden.  Mu plays.

56) 1) dialog: So who left who?
56) 3) dialog: Why?
56) 5) dialog: Uh-oh.  That's not good. We've been aware of the conversation at a nearby table -- now we can hear it.  Two slightly rowdy men.
56) 22) dialog: No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same. They walk on and then...
56) 23) dialog: In fact -- give me a second. And she walks straight back to their table.
56) 24) dialog: Hi.
56) 26) dialog: I'm sorry about my friend -- he's very sensitive.
56) 28) dialog: Please, please -- let's just leave it there.  I'm sure you meant no harm, and I'm sure it was just friendly banter and I'm sure you dicks are all the size of peanuts.  A perfect match for the size of your brains.  Enjoy your meal.  The tuna's really good. And she walks away.  Gerald turns to Lawrence.
57) 1) dialog: I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
57) 3) dialog: I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
57) 5) dialog: I don't know either. They have arrived at the end of the arcade.
57) 6) dialog: Here we are. (pause) Do you want to come up?
57) 8) dialog: There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up? His look says yes.
57) 9) dialog: Give me five minutes. He watches her go -- and stands in the street.  Music pla
58) 1) dialog: Hiya. There's something slightly awry.  He doesn't notice.
58) 4) dialog: (pause) You've got to go.
58) 6) dialog: Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
58) 8) dialog: Yes...
58) 21) dialog: Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
58) 27) dialog: Nice surprise. He kisses her.

So what was a stupid photo- shoot now looks like a porno film. And well... the pictures have been solid and they're everywhere. William shakes his head.
78) 2) dialog: I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
78) 4) dialog: Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be. She's very shaken.
78) 5) dialog: These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
78) 7) dialog: A bath would be great.
79) 0) text: Spike enters through the front door.  William doesn't hea Spike is reading newspapers with the Anna pictures in it.

84) 3) dialog: I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
84) 5) dialog: I have thought about you.
84) 7) dialog: Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
84) 9) dialog: Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
84) 11) dialog: Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.

85) 4) dialog: 'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
85) 6) dialog: Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
85) 8) dialog: 'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
85) 10) dialog: My son's name is Johnny?
85) 12) dialog: Well, get a message through to him too.
85) 14) dialog: What do you think?
85) 16) dialog: You think I should do Henry James instead?
85) 18) dialog: Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
86) 0) text: Anna and William.  Sat down at table.  There's a picture hanging on the wall behind.
86) 1) dialog: I can't believe you have that picture on your wall. It is a poster of a Chagall painting of a floating weddin with a goat as company.
86) 3) dialog: I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
86) 5) dialog: Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat. Spike enters with three pizzas.

88) 1) dialog: The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
88) 3) dialog: Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'

90) 18) dialog: Okay.
91) 0) text: A few moments later.  William and Anna stand in the middl the room.  He kisses her neck.  Then her shoulder.  What miracle it is just to be able to touch this girl's skin. he looks at her face.  That face.  He is suddenly struck it is.
91) 2) dialog: What? And then gets over it straight away.
93) 2) dialog: You and every person in this country.
93) 4) dialog: What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
93) 6) dialog: No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
93) 8) dialog: But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
93) 11) dialog: Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
93) 13) dialog: Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
93) 15) dialog: (very touched) Oh. She looks at him carefully.  Then leaps out of bed.

94) 5) dialog: You get the door, I'll get the jam.
95) 2) dialog: What?
95) 4) dialog: You're up to something... She thinks he's fooling around.  She opens the door, the explosion.  In a split second she's inside.

95) 7) dialog: Jesus.
96) 0) text: Anna is on the phone.  Spike is blithely heading downstai the kitchen in just his underpants.
96) 2) dialog: (on the phone) It's Anna.  The press are here.  No, there are hundreds of them.  My brilliant plan was not so brilliant after all.  Yeh, I know, I know.  Just get me out then. (she hangs up) Damnit. She heads upstairs.
99) 2) dialog: How do you think I'm doing?
99) 4) dialog: I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was. She's packing.
99) 6) dialog: Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
99) 9) dialog: This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
99) 11) dialog: As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
99) 13) dialog: You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
99) 15) dialog: Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott. She heads out.
100) 2) dialog: I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home. The doorbell goes.
101) 1) dialog: And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
101) 5) dialog: You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
101) 7) dialog: Excuse me?
101) 9) dialog: You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever. He takes this in.  That's the end.
108) 8) dialog: This is certainly... ah...
108) 10) dialog: I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to... The third assistant is under pressure.

108) 14) dialog: But... wait... there are things to say.

110) 8) dialog: I'm not listening.
110) 10) dialog: I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet. Back by the desk, William is listening and laughs.  That' girl.  Anna prepares.
110) 11) dialog: So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
110) 13) dialog: And then I... right.
110) 15) dialog: Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.

114) 3) dialog: You disappeared.
114) 5) dialog: Well... how have you been?
114) 7) dialog: Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is... (she's nervous) Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and... It's quite a big wrapped parcel, flat -- 3 foot by 4 foot leaning against a bookshelf.
114) 8) dialog: I thought I'd give it to you.
114) 10) dialog: No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
114) 12) dialog: I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
114) 17) dialog: Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again. Pause as William takes this in.
114) 19) dialog: You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England? Martin edges up.
114) 25) dialog: Is that right?
114) 27) dialog: I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
114) 29) dialog: Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.' She's kind in here, not sarcastic.
114) 33) dialog: That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict. She's awaiting an answer.
114) 36) dialog: ... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
114) 39) dialog: I see. (pause) That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
114) 41) dialog: Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision. Pause.
114) 42) dialog: The fame thing isn't really real, you know.  Don't forget -- I'm also just a girl.  Standing in front of a boy. Asking him to love her. Pause.  She kisses him on the cheek.
114) 43) dialog: Bye. Then turns and leaves.  Leaving him.
