13) 1) dialog: The unreliable narrator!
13) 3) dialog: (mile-a-minute) My thesis! Unreliable narrators are considered a “device,” right? Don’t answer, they are. They don’t get a lot of literary analysis because it’s a gimmick, a trick. I mean yeah, Canterbury Tales gets a shout out for having one, but usually it’s the stuff of popcorn crime novels and thriller movies. Agatha Christie, Usual Suspects, so on and so forth. But I’m going to argue that by definition, any narrator is unreliable. (MORE )
13) 5) dialog: Because when someone is telling a story, there is always a distance from the actual story to their telling of the story. Therefore, any story that has EVER been told has an unreliable narrator. The only truly reliable narrator would be someone hypothetically telling a story as it happens before our eyes, which is obviously impossible. And what does that mean? (deep breath) It means that the only truly reliable narrator is life itself. But life itself, by it’s very nature, is an unreliable narrator, too - because it is constantly misdirecting us, misleading us, taking us on a journey where it’s literally impossible to predict what is going to happen next. That’s my thesis: life as the ultimate unreliable narrator. (then) What do you think?

28) 49) dialog: Or maybe neither. Maybe life is playing the role of unreliable trickster, yet again. Maybe those it paints as the heroes and villains of our stories are actually just day players in a much bigger movie. BACK TO ABBY AND WILL.
28) 50) dialog: Maybe they are simply extras, filling the frame, just so the real heroes can have bodies crossing in the background. Abby finishes reading, looks sheepishly up at Will. A long beat of silence, then:
