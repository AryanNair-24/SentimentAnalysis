3) 3) dialog: (approaching reception area) Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak.  Clementine Kruczynski.
4) 23) dialog: Hi. After a moment, Clementine appears in the doorway.  Mary leads her down the hall, not looking back.
4) 25) dialog: Okay, I guess.
5) 0) text: Mierzwiak directs Clementine to a chair next to a coffee table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues.  Mierzwi sits across from her.  He smiles.
5) 2) dialog: Okay, I guess.
5) 4) dialog: I don't care. He turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin.
5) 5) dialog: Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
5) 7) dialog: What?  No.  I don't like the term boyfriend.  It's so gay. Mierzwiak nods.  He's attentive, pleasant, and neutral throughout.
5) 8) dialog: Maybe gay isn't the right word.  But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is.  Heheh.  My significant other... heh heh.  And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning.  Do I end it?  Should I give it more time?  I'm not happy, but what do I expect?  Relationships require work. You know the drill.  The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right?  So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy.  It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know?  That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be.  But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it.  You know?  Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated.  Y'know?
5) 10) dialog: Um, well, he's a fucking tidy one --
9) 0) text: It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty.  Joel s in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl tomato soup.  An elderly couple drink coffee at the count Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood.  Joe glances at her bright blue hair.  She picks an empty boot and sits.  Joel studies her discreetly.  The waitress approaches her with a coffee pot.
9) 2) dialog: God, yes.  You've saved my life! The waitress pours the coffee.
9) 4) dialog: (laughing) Ain't that the question of the century. The waitress is not amused.
9) 5) dialog: You got grilled cheese and tomato soup?
9) 7) dialog: (calling) And some cream, please. Clementine looks around the place.  Her eyes meet Joel's before he is able to look away.  She smiles vaguely.  He looks embarrassed, then down at his journal.  Clementine pulls a book from her purse and starts to read.  Joel gla up, tries to see the cover.  It's blue.  He can't read th title.
11) 0) text: Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train.  Clementine enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person the She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if they're old friends.  He waves back, embarrassed.  She ta a seat on a bench far down the platform.  Joel stares at hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order conceal his awkwardness.
12) 0) text: Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the slowly passing desolate terrain.  After a moment the door between cars opens and Clementine enters.  Joel looks up. Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deci where to sit.  She settles on a seat at the opposite end the car.  Joel looks out the window.  He feels her watchi him.  The train is picking up speed.  Finally:
12) 1) dialog: (calling over the rumble) Hi! Joel looks over.
12) 3) dialog: Why?
12) 5) dialog: Why are you sorry?  I just said hi.
12) 7) dialog: Really?
12) 9) dialog: Aw, c'mon, live dangerously.  Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
12) 11) dialog: It's okay if I sit closer?  So I don't have to scream.  Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me. (pause) But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
12) 13) dialog: Oh.  So... She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where came from.
12) 15) dialog: No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
12) 17) dialog: Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me. (sits across aisle from Joel) How far are you going?  On the train, I mean, of course.
12) 19) dialog: Get out!  Me too!  What are the odds?
12) 21) dialog: Ucch, really?  You're kidding.  God. Bizarre small world, huh?  Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
12) 23) dialog: Jesus, is it five years?  I gotta quit right now.
12) 25) dialog: Well, I'm there.  I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible.  You have a cell phone?  I need to quit right this minute.  I'll call in dead.
12) 27) dialog: I'll go on the dole.  Like my daddy before me.
12) 29) dialog: Ah, the hair. (pulls a strand in front of her eyes, studies it) Blue, right?  It's called Blue Ruin.  The color.  Snappy name, huh?
12) 31) dialog: Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
12) 33) dialog: Exactly!  Tom Waits.  Which song?
12) 35) dialog: Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.  Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names.  How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do.  Fuck the dole.
12) 37) dialog: Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
12) 39) dialog: (pissy) Someone's got that job. (excited) Agent Orange!  I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
12) 41) dialog: My writing career!  Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski. (thought) The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
12) 43) dialog: I think.  Anyway, I've tried all their colors.  More than once.  I'm getting too old for this.  But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste.  You?
12) 45) dialog: Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
12) 47) dialog: Yeah, I got it. There's a silence.
12) 48) dialog: My name's Clementine, by the way.
12) 50) dialog: No jokes about my name?  Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
12) 52) dialog: Huckleberry Hound?
12) 54) dialog: Huckleberry Hound!  What, are you nuts?
12) 56) dialog: (singing) Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine?  No?
12) 58) dialog: (impressed) Yeah.  Although it hardly fits.  I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
12) 60) dialog: (pissy) Why wouldn't you think that about me?
12) 62) dialog: Now I'm nice?  Don't you know any other adjectives?  There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
12) 64) dialog: I just don't think "nice" is a particularly interesting thing to be. The conductor enters the car.
12) 66) dialog: What is nice, anyway?  I mean, besides an adjective?  I guess it can be an adverb, sort of. The conductor turns to Clementine.  She fishes in her bag
12) 67) dialog: It doesn't reveal anything.  Nice is pandering.  Cowardly.
12) 68) dialog: And life is more interesting than that. Or should be.  Jesus God, I hope it is... someday. (to conductor) I know it's here. The conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated.
12) 69) dialog: I don't need nice.  I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
12) 71) dialog: Shit.  Shit.  I know it's here.  Hold on. She dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts frantically through.  Joel sees the book she was reading the diner.  It's The Play by Stephen Dixon.
12) 72) dialog: Damn it.  DAMN IT! (there it is) Oh.  Here. She hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly.  He punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away.
12) 74) dialog: Joel?  It's Joel, right?
12) 76) dialog: I'm sorry I... yelled at you.  Was it yelling?  I can't really tell.  Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
12) 78) dialog: (stares out window) My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice.  Right now, anyway.  I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like.  But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me.  That was nice of you.
12) 80) dialog: Oh, okay.  Well, sure, I'll just... (stands, throws bag over shoulder) Take care, then.
12) 82) dialog: (heading toward other end of car) Unless I get that hair-color-naming job. Clementine sits and stares out the window.
13) 0) text: There are a few more people in the car now.  Clementine h inched a few seats closer to Joel.  She watches him.  His head is immersed in his journal.
14) 0) text: It's dark out.  The train is pretty crowded.  Joel stares the window.  Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes h
16) 0) text: Joel drives.  He passes Clementine walking.  She looks co He considers, slows, rolls down his window.
16) 2) dialog: No, that's okay.  Thanks, though.
16) 4) dialog: I don't want to take you out of your way.
16) 6) dialog: Yeah? He pulls over.  She climbs in.  They drive.
16) 8) dialog: You're not a stalker or anything, right?
16) 10) dialog: You can't be too careful.  I've been stalked.  I've been told I'm highly stalkable.  I don't need that.
16) 12) dialog: (beat) You know Wilmont?
16) 14) dialog: Wilmont.  Near the high school. Joel turns.  They drive in silence.
16) 15) dialog: Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso.  I'm not really.
16) 17) dialog: So you like bookstores, huh?
16) 19) dialog: Me too.  It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
16) 21) dialog: The song's 9th and Hennepin.  I spent most of the train ride trying to remember.  "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen."  Remember?
16) 23) dialog: Remember?  "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..." (starts to cry) Oh, shit.  I'm so stupid.  Sorry.
16) 25) dialog: I'm just a bit of a wreck.  "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry. (pointing to a house) Me. Joel pulls over.
16) 26) dialog: Thanks very much.  That was very nice of you.
16) 28) dialog: Oh, geez, I'm full of shit.  I already told you that. (pause) Anyway.  See Ya. Clementine opens the car door.
16) 30) dialog: (turning back) Hey, do you want to have a drink?  I have lots of drinks.  And I could --
16) 32) dialog: Never mind.  Sorry, that was stupid.  I'm embarrassed.  Good night, Joel.
17) 0) text: Joel stands in the living room, somewhat nervously.  He t to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings.  He look the books on her shelves.  Clementine is in the kitchen. see her as she passes by the doorway several times, prepa drinks and chatting.
17) 1) dialog: Thanks.  I like it, too.  Been here about four years.  It's really cheap.  My downstairs neighbor is old so she's quiet, which is great.  And the landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but great, and I have a little porch in the back, which is great, because I can read there, and listen to my crickets and... Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and ton
17) 2) dialog: Two blue ruins... Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of crows flying.
17) 3) dialog: You like that?
17) 5) dialog: This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently.  I like it, too.  I like crows.  I think I used to be a crow. She caws and hands Joel a drink.
17) 7) dialog: Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
17) 9) dialog: Me neither.  Oh, there's an inscription on the back. (takes it off the wall, reads:) The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
17) 11) dialog: (impressed) Yeah.  I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch.  His stuff seems strictly grade school to me.  But this made me cry for some reason.  Maybe because it is grade school.  Y'know?
17) 13) dialog: I miss grade school.  I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden.  When I went we called it elementary school.  But I like grade school better.  Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then.  Everyone wore hats.  Anyway, cheers!
17) 15) dialog: God, that feels so fucking good.  Take yours off.
17) 17) dialog: Yeah?  Well, have a seat, anyway. Joel sits in a chair across the room.  Clementine finishe her drink.
17) 18) dialog: Ready for another?
17) 20) dialog: Well, I'm ready.  Put some music on. Joel crosses to the CD's and studies them.
17) 22) dialog: You pick it.
17) 24) dialog: I don't know!  I can't see them from here, Joel!  Just pick something good. Joel studies the unfamiliar CD's.  He picks up Bang On a performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at. Clementine reenters with her drink.
17) 25) dialog: Oh, excellent choice. She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player.  The music i dreamy and haunting and slow.  Clementine falls back onto couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink.
17) 26) dialog: Mmmmmmm.  Way to go, Joel.  You pick good. Joel sits down in his chair and drinks.  There's a silenc which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious.
17) 28) dialog: No, stay.  Just for a little while. (opens her eyes, brightly) Refill?
17) 30) dialog: I know a man who needs a refill. She grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the kitchen.
17) 31) dialog: God bless alcohol, is what I say.  Where would I be without it.  Oh, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, maybe I don't want to think about that. She giggles.  Joel looks around the room again.  There ar several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteac potato, a housewife potato.  Clementine returns with Joel drink and a refill for herself.
17) 33) dialog: Drink up, young man.  It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant. Joel looks a little alarmed.
17) 34) dialog: I'm just kidding.  C'mon. She sits back on the couch, closes her eyes.  Joel watche her, looks at her breasts.  She opens her eyes, smiles drunkenly at him.
17) 35) dialog: Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
17) 37) dialog: Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic.  She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
17) 39) dialog: Me neither.  But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know.  Maybe that's just coincidence.  Right?  Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it?  Y'know?
17) 41) dialog: Exactly.  Exactly!  That's exactly my feeling about it.  It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen?  That's what you're saying, right?  You forget about those times.  Right?
17) 43) dialog: (dreamy beat) But I think I am.  I like to think I am.
17) 44) dialog: It's helpful to think there's some order to things.  You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
17) 46) dialog: Oh. (considers this) Does that make you sad?  Or anxious?  I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know?  Taking advantage of every possibility?  Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
17) 48) dialog: You're really nice.  I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it.  God, I'm an idiot.
17) 50) dialog: I like you.  That's the thing about my psychic thing.  I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people.  My problem is I never trust it.  But I get it.  And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
17) 52) dialog: And, anyway, you sell yourself short.  I can tell.  There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain.  I can tell.  My goal... can I tell you my goal?
17) 54) dialog: (ala Paul Simon) What's the goal, Joel? (laughs) My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me?  Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent.  Y'know? You love someone -- that's it.  Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do.  It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through.  And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing.  You know?
17) 56) dialog: Like I wanted to talk to you.  I didn't need any more reason to do it.  Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
17) 58) dialog: You're very nice.  God, I have to stop saying that.  You're nervous around me, huh?
17) 60) dialog: I'm nervous.  You don't need to be nervous around me, though.  I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
17) 62) dialog: I don't either.  I used to.  But I'm through with that.  Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost.  You know?
17) 63) dialog: With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend. (beat) So, I've been seeing this guy... Joel looks slightly crestfallen.
17) 64) dialog: (off his reaction) Well, for the last week, anyway!  He's kind of a kid.  Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering.  Who wouldn't like that?  And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart.  He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
17) 66) dialog: That made me cry.  But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River.  It gets frozen this time of year.
17) 68) dialog: Exactly!  I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know?  And that's where psychic stuff comes in.  Like, it just isn't right with him.  Y'know?
17) 70) dialog: I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things.  We like the same writers.  This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute.  It's fucked up.  Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
17) 72) dialog: Yeah?  Oh, great! She sits closer to him.
17) 73) dialog: I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
17) 75) dialog: (pause) You should stay.
17) 77) dialog: (beat) Okay. Joel puts on his overcoat.  Clementine heads to the phone table, pulls out a notepad.
17) 78) dialog: I would like you to call me.  Would you do that?  I would like that.
17) 82) dialog: You'll call me, right?
17) 84) dialog: When?
17) 86) dialog: Tonight.  Just to test out the phone lines and all.
21) 0) text: Joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop.  It's a jarring transition, visually and emotionally.  Joel is in the mid of some traumatic state of mind. He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watche Clementine stack books on shelves.  Her hair is bright or now.
21) 8) dialog: You were not.
21) 10) dialog: Come over after I'm done here?
21) 12) dialog: You rat.
21) 15) dialog: (to Patrick) You didn't say anything about my hair.
21) 17) dialog: In the room?
27) 0) text: Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas.  His eyes are clo and electrodes connect his head to several machines.  The machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street cloth and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of lig blips running like streams through an image of Joel's bra Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for lines.  Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at th bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines.
29) 0) text: Joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two la plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship wi Clementine.  There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has l there, some CD's.  He pulls a big clump of pages out of h loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag. He gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes: December 15, 2004   Nothing much happened today.  I staye home.

47) 7) dialog: ...a little.  I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
47) 10) dialog: Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody.  It's just a fucking dent.  You're like some old lady or something.
47) 13) dialog: A wino?  Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino! (laughs) Face it, Joel.  You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
48) 0) text: Joel looks at his dented car, looks at Clementine clompin off in the distance.
49) 0) text: Joel drives to catch up with Clementine.  He rolls down h window to talk to her.

50) 0) text: It's a street you might see in a dream, more an impressio a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detai there is obscured in darkness.  Joel wanders it.  In the distance Clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop she doesn't get any farther away.  It's lonely.

55) 6) dialog: You're not ready.
55) 8) dialog: What?!
55) 10) dialog: Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it! Joel looks around.  People are watching.
55) 11) dialog: You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
55) 13) dialog: (screaming now) I'd make a fucking good mother!  I love children!  I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother! The scene starts to fade.  Clementine's rant continues bu becomes attenuated and vague.
55) 15) dialog: It's you!  It's you who can't commit to anything!  You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!  I don't even know why I am!  I should just end it right here, Joel.  Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with! She's crying now, but it's almost animatronic, no real emotion in it.  The scene is a husk.
55) 17) dialog: I'm glad. Their eyes lock.  She is fading before his eyes.
56) 0) text: It's noisy and crowded.  Joel and Clementine sit at a sma table.  She is drunk and staring off, blankly.

56) 4) dialog: Joel, this is Mark.  He likes my boobs. He came over special to tell me that. Isn't that nice.  He doesn't think I'm fat. The scene starts to fade.  Mark rises.
56) 6) dialog: S'okay, Mark.  Joel doesn't like my boobs. (stage whisper) I don't think he likes girls. The bar gets quiet and vague.
56) 8) dialog: You're a whiz kid.  So perceptive, so -- Clementine keeps talking but there are no more intelligib words, just a whisper -- like a breeze. A doorbell buzzes.  Joel looks up.
