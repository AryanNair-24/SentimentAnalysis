35) 29) text: Delia turns to Charles and Lydia for help -- doesn't get it -- and at last pulls Otho into the living room single-handedly. All this while the Moving Men are variously carting out the handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous new furniture. Otho is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and faggoty.  But he's not all fat and fun -- this customer carries nasty emotional weight as well.
35) 37) text: He exits to find solace in a quiet corner of his house. During this speech, Otho has been surreptitiously pos- ing for Lydia's camera.  She clicks the shutter.

50) 13) dialog: (dramatically) I say let's keep it the way it is.
50) 14) text: Delia stares at Lydia.
50) 17) dialog: I do.  I really like it.  I mean, it's already sort of like somebody's home, isn't it?  Their couch is comfortable and doesn't stick to your legs.  It smells like a real home, not a French whorehouse.

62) 0) text: Lydia listens.  Did she hear something?  She puts her hand on the knob and tries to turn it.  It's stuck. Then the key eerily pops out of the lock and falls on the floor. Charles' head suddenly appears behind her.  Scares her.

70) 0) text: Lydia enters.  The room is dim, and filled with dust motes.  There are shadows in all the corners. She bumps into a switch which engages the model sun and moon and that eerily illuminates the model town.  She's frightened, then entranced. She peers at it from different angles, her fear for- gotten.  She notes small tools scattered around an unfinished area.  She continues around the model, oblivious to everything else.  Then... She kicks something.  Ducks under the table and comes up with something, holds it up to the light.  It's the handbook.  She looks through it.  Finds the marked page... looks at the chalk door.
72) 0) text: Lydia is studying the handbook with intense interest.
72) 2) text: Lydia gives one more look at the book, and then goes to the door quickly and silently.

Then she turns over, and is lost to the world totally. Barbara sighs.  She and Adam walk toward the door. When they open it however, Lydia is standing there in her pajamas -- she snaps a FLASH Polaroid -- and Adam and Barbara jump backwards with yelps of fright.
86) 4) dialog: Sick!  Sexual perversion!  If you're going to do weird sexual stuff you ought to stay in your bedroom, okay?

86) 11) dialog: (skeptical, cautious) W... What do you look like under there?
87) 2) dialog: I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are sheets.  Are you gross under there?  Are you "Night of the Living Dead" under there? Like all bloody veins and pus?
87) 4) dialog: "Night of the Living Dead?"  It's a movie.
87) 6) dialog: You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
87) 9) dialog: Is this like a trick question?
87) 11) dialog: (offended) Of course I can see you.
87) 13) dialog: I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through the "Handbook for the Recently Deceased."  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... I, myself, am strange and unusual.

88) 18) text: Lydia starts to exit.
88) 20) dialog: (looks him up and down) Wait a minute, what if this is a dream?  Can you do any tricks to prove I'm not dreaming?

Is it Kerosene du Pape?  He smiles.  All smile. Otho is more interested in Lydia's story.  He leans toward her...
101) 8) text: Lydia's eyes widen.  MUSIC UP.  All the guests are spellbound. Charles, too, has the beat -- The Ink Spots in his eyes. In a voice not his own.
101) 10) text: Delia is shocked.  She looks at Lydia.
101) 18) text: A look of sheer delight comes across Lydia's face, unlike anything we have previously seen.  She dances and claps her hands in time with the music.  She is in teen heaven. NOTE:  Delia and the guests are fully aware of their singing/actions, but helpless to stop themselves.  While it is funny, it is nevertheless just a little frighten- ing. Lydia excitedly looks around the room to see if she can see the ghosts.  She can't. Now the song pauses... Everyone tries to recover for a shocked second.  Instead, the tempo changes. As the tempo quickens, the guest/chorus is syncopated like alternating pistons as they are pushed and pulled into their chairs.  They sing throughout.
102) 14) dialog: (from outside the door) It's me.  Lydia.
102) 15) text: Adam, puzzled, goes to the door and opens it.  Lydia is standing there, sheepish.
