2) 7) dialog: (behind him) I'm ready!
2) 8) text: Adam turns to see entering:  BARBARA MAITLAND, 35 -- a wholesome beauty who is mellowing well.  She smiles at him.  Perhaps a certain tinge of sadness about her, because they don't have children.
2) 10) dialog: (eyeing the model) It looks great.
2) 13) dialog: Happy vacation, honey!
2) 16) dialog: Helen got it for me in Oslo. There's enough to refinish the gateleg table and the cherry wardrobe...
2) 17) text: Adam hands Barbara a carefully-wrapped bundle -- she unwraps her gift... rolls of very expensive floral wallpaper.  She cradles it in her arms like gold leaf.
2) 18) dialog: Oh, Adam... it's beautiful.
2) 21) dialog: (cooing) I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home... (with a sudden resolve) ... I'm going to get started right now!
2) 23) text: Barbara calms down, returning to Adam's embrace... as: PHONE RINGS -- They freeze, then grin.
2) 26) dialog: Oh no.
3) 0) text: CAMERA FOLLOWS Adam and Barbara downstairs.  We see the rambling, old fashioned quality to the house. Clean, sentimental, warm and floral.  Some rooms in progress.  They continue down the main staircase past photos of themselves, old photos of the early days of Winter River, pictures and mementos of three generations in hardware.  Barbara goes to the kitchen and Adam continues down to the basement.
4) 0) text: Barbara makes dash for it and holds it just as Jane gets a foot in.  Jane smiles wildly.
4) 2) dialog: That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
4) 4) dialog: No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
4) 6) dialog: That's what we're looking for, too.
4) 8) text: That hurts Barbara a little.  She looks at Jane.
4) 11) dialog: (shutting door) 'Bye, Jane, see you in a few weeks.
5) 0) text: Barbara is starting to paper the walls already.  She frowns at the MUSIC.  Goes to the door.
5) 1) dialog: Oh, honey.  You said no Inkspots on this vacation!
7) 2) dialog: What for?
7) 4) text: Barbara has already papered a few rolls in the guest room.
7) 5) dialog: Okay, but let's hurry back.  You just run in okay?
8) 0) text: The Victorian house from the model "in the flesh." Adam stands by the station wagon. On the bumper of the car is a sticker reading: WARNING:  I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS. Barbara gets in driver's side.  They drive off.
9) 1) dialog: (preoccupied) Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
10) 2) dialog: I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
10) 4) text: Car reaches the rickety covered bridge.  Car shakes, bobbing up and down on every plank. ON Barbara and Adam TIGHT -- (they've done this routine before).  They sing an old Johnny Mathis song.  With a lot of vibrato.
11) 2) dialog: Wave at the lion.
11) 4) dialog: (embarrassed) Adam!
17) 1) dialog: It's a beauty.
17) 3) dialog: (jokingly) With all these historical landmarks in town, where are they going to put the condominiums?
17) 5) dialog: (nervous) Oh... I'm sorry...
17) 6) text: Barbara starts to apply the brakes. Just before the bridge the dog waddles out in the road. Stops to pee.  Barbara swerves.  As the car hits the rickety bridge, the speed is just a bit too much. Boards RATTLE and loosen, the car skews and catches in an open slot, careens to the right, then the left and the bridge.
18) 0) text: A piling has smashed through the window on the pas- senger side, crushing the upper part of Barbara's arm.  She is wailing in pain and fright. Adam tries to help Barbara.  He tries to get out of the car.  None of this succeeds.
21) 0) text: Quiet, still, expectant.  There is a fire laid in the hearth.  Suddenly and for no apparent reason it ignites and burns with a furious cheerfulness. Barbara and Adam enter, dazed, wet, and bedraggled.
21) 1) dialog: Something like this always happens when we try to go on vacation. Always.
21) 4) text: He holds out his hands to be warmed.  Barbara comes up beside him.  All this time she's been holding her injured arm with the other hand.
21) 5) dialog: This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
21) 7) dialog: I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.
21) 10) dialog: Oh, Adam.
22) 0) text: They are sitting on the couch together.  Barbara is looking away slightly -- as one does when a doctor is drawing blood -- while Adam looks at her fingers.  He frowns. He looks at his skin.  It is pale.  He looks at Barbara.
22) 2) dialog: I am sitting.
22) 4) dialog: (pause) Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
22) 7) text: Barbara tests her hand, clenches and unclenches her fist.
22) 8) dialog: I'm fine.  My arm works fine.
23) 0) text: Adam's face is painted with color of sunset.  He stands atop the steps leading down to the front yard.  Barbara stands just inside the open threshold, looking out worriedly.
23) 1) dialog: (quiet sarcasm) The end of a perfect day.
23) 5) dialog: Adam!
25) 0) text: It's Barbara who's grabbed him, and quite evidently saved his life -- not life, perhaps -- but existence. He's shaken, breathless. Barbara stares at him, as if wondering what he's just been through.
25) 2) dialog: Two hours.
25) 4) dialog: That's how long you were gone.
26) 0) text: Barbara leads Adam into the house.
26) 2) dialog: Yes, it did.  Yes, it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries.
26) 3) dialog: stands by the mirror over the hearth mantle.  On the mantle is Barbara's prize collection of porcelain horses.  Adam comes to stand beside her.  They look into the mirror, and there is no reflection of them. Barbara picks up one of the horses, and trots it through the air.  The horse is imaged in the mirror.
26) 4) dialog: (continuing) There's that, and there's this.
26) 7) dialog: Deceased.  I don't know where it came from.  Look at the publisher.
26) 9) dialog: (finally admit- ting it) I don't think we survived the crash.
27) 0) text: Adam is already in bed, reading from the handbook. Barbara is getting ready for bed -- going through a ritual of sorts that they practiced every night of their married lives.
27) 1) dialog: I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
27) 3) dialog: There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to last?
27) 5) dialog: paces, she trips on her wallpaper rolls.  Kicks them.
27) 6) dialog: I knew I'd never finish the guest room.  Adam, we just can't stay in here forever!
27) 12) dialog: Oh, God, maybe this is all just a bad dream.
27) 15) text: Barbara looks up at him, questioningly.
27) 16) dialog: Why?  What's wrong?  Adam?
28) 0) text: Adam is setting up a small monument in the model town cemetery.  It reads:  ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND/UNITED IN LIFE/UNDIVIDED IN DEATH.
28) 2) text: Barbara, trying to clean, lets out a frustrated YELP! She paces.
28) 4) dialog: I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
28) 6) dialog: (looking at the dusty walls) In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
28) 8) dialog: Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you.  I really need to be around people, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
28) 10) text: Barbara shakes her head and picks up the Handbook and pages through it desperately.
28) 11) dialog: I keep having this feeling that something has got to happen.
28) 12) text: CAR DOOR SLAMS outside.  Adam and Barbara look at one another.  Run to window.
30) 2) dialog: What's she doing here?
32) 0) text: Barbara watches Adam, and shakes her head.  He stops.
32) 1) dialog: She can't see you, right?
32) 3) dialog: (continuing) In the book, Rule Number Two:  the living usually won't see the dead.
32) 5) dialog: Just says "won't."  Wait a minute. Here it says "the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead."
32) 7) text: Barbara sighs and nods.
32) 8) dialog: At least we won't have to worry about her.
34) 0) text: The Maitlands are asleep.  CAMERA EXPLORES the room a bit.  It is getting slightly tatty.  Adam rolls over, pulling the covers off Barbara.  We see: ON BARBARA -- she is hovering off the side of the bed. An OMINOUS RUMBLE -- like a 4.0 earthquake shakes the house.  GLASS RATTLES, the ceramic horses on the mantelpiece jump around.  Barbara falls to the floor. They look at one another with horror.  They leap up and run downstairs.
35) 0) text: The RUMBLE BUILDS TO A CLIMAX, there is a LOUD METALLIC SQUEAL, and then a CRASH... just as Barbara and Adam arrive.
35) 5) text: Delia is relentlessly New York, relentlessly fashion- able, relentlessly thin -- totally self assured. She is also a woman with a mission -- to gut Barbara and Adam's house and remake it in her own very upscale image. Delia's gaze is on the living room, but she looks  through Adam and Barbara as if they weren't even there (which to her eyes they're not). Still holding the baluster, Delia gets up off the couch and moves into the living room, surveying it with an odd mixture of ambition, and resolution.
35) 19) text: A movement makes Lydia turn around and scream.  It is Delia.  Not Barbara.
36) 0) text: At one end, near the stairs leading up to the attic, Barbara and Adam are slumped against opposite walls.
36) 1) dialog: Adam, we are in hell.  I hate these people.
36) 3) dialog: Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
36) 5) text: Barbara looks at him.
36) 6) dialog: (continuing) Ghosts!
36) 7) text: Barbara is shocked at the reality. Otho and Delia come up the stairs at the end of the hallway.
36) 9) text: Otho looks down the hallway.  It's empty.  Adam and Barbara are no longer there.
37) 0) text: It's not Lydia's room yet, of course, because it still has the Maitlands' furniture in it.  Barbara had partly wallpapered it before the accident.  Her tools are still there.
37) 4) text: Otho spray-paints the word VIRIDIAN on the wall -- plus the word BLUE GREEN -- and Cr2 03, right over a picture of Adam and Barbara as kids.
37) 13) text: He finds, neatly hung in plastic, the Maitlands' wedding outfits.  Totally captivated by this powerful image, he peers through the plastic at them.  Holding each up to Delia.  Barbara watches wide-eyed at them.
37) 15) text: Delia slams the door in Barbara's contorted face.
38) 3) text: There is one slight difference, however, because on the rag rug in the middle of the floor lies Adam's headless corpse.  Standing over him, holding in one hand a long knife and in the other Adam's blood-and-gore dripping head is Barbara -- with a maniacal look on her face. Behind them, Charles is thumbing through Adam's Audubon collection.  He sits up like a cornered animal protect- ing his territory.
38) 9) dialog: I'm going to get her.
44) 0) text: Barbara still holding Adam's head. Charles still calmly leafing through the Audubons.
44) 2) dialog: I cannot witness this.
44) 3) text: Barbara distractedly puts Adam's head on a bookshelf. His headless body fumbles with the books and finally reattaches the head.
45) 0) text: Adam turns away from the window. Barbara, fuming, moves around Charles making wild gestures.
45) 1) dialog: What's the good of being a ghost if you can't frighten people to death?
45) 3) dialog: No, I'm not putting up with this.
46) 0) text: Barbara storms in, as if straight from the room up- stairs.  She heads straight for the back door.  Just as she opens the door, Adam rushes up.
46) 2) dialog: Nothing can be worse than this...
47) 0) text: Barbara plunges into the dusty surface of Titan with an enormous Saturn looming in the sky.  She looks around with wonder and some fear.
47) 6) dialog: Oh Adam.  Find somebody.  I'm getting all yellow.  Do something!
47) 10) dialog: slightly angered at it, instinctively bats at it.
47) 12) dialog: bats at it again.  Adam is wide-eyed, tries to pull her away.  The Sandworm recovers and ROARS after them.
48) 0) text: Barbara, weeping, throws herself in Adam's arms.
48) 1) dialog: Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
48) 3) dialog: I know.  I'm sorry.
48) 5) dialog: (continuing) I just realized that I could have been killed alone.  Don't ever leave me, honey.
48) 7) dialog: (continuing) We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
48) 9) dialog: (a tentative smile) Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
49) 0) text: Adam has his arms around Barbara's shoulder.  They walk in the door and stumble upon the Deetzes at their dinner.  Lydia's back is to them.  Barbara and Adam back out of the room but stop to listen.
51) 0) text: Adam and Barbara are lying down on the floor, peering out of one of the small windows overlooking the front yard of the house.  The handbook open in front of them.
53) 0) text: Adam and Barbara just look at one another as if to say "We're next!"  Adam leafs through the handbook furi- ously.
53) 1) dialog: Look in the index...
53) 5) text: The remainder of the sheet is torn off. ON Barbara -- fingering the torn edge.  Looking in the book for the remainder.  No luck.
53) 6) dialog: That's it?  No number, or instructions?
54) 4) text: When her gaze reaches to top of the house, she suddenly glimpses Barbara and Adam's faces in the window.
56) 0) text: Barbara is half-hiding on the edge of the window.
56) 1) dialog: That little girl saw us.
56) 3) dialog: But she saw us.  I could feel it.
59) 2) text: Barbara smiles and knits while rocking in her chair.
61) 0) text: Barbara and Adam, surprised by the key, look at each other, carefully, very quietly, stand up and tiptoe toward door.
61) 7) text: He POPS OFF.  Adam and Barbara stare at each other.
63) 0) text: Adam is holding on tight to the knob of the door.  With her knitting needle, Barbara has poked the key out. The two stand absolutely still, listening, terrified of the living intruders.
65) 0) text: Barbara and Adam tighten.
66) 0) text: Barbara and Adam have moved away from the door.
66) 2) dialog: Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
66) 4) dialog: (continuing) You don't actually think this is going to work?
66) 6) dialog: Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.  Why don't we try this Beetle guy??...
66) 8) text: He looks at book, then writes on the door:  KNOCK AND ENTER.  He exchanges a glance with Barbara.  She's even more skeptical than before.  Turns away in disgust. Adam knocks on the door, and turns the knob.  Nothing. She is more disgusted.  Adam goes back to the book.
66) 10) text: He knocks three times.  Turns knob.  The chalked door swings magnificently open. Behind is an eerie light source, SOARING MUSIC, maybe even a heavenly choir singing pear-shaped syllables. Barbara and Adam look at one another again.  They hold hands and step tentatively through. Their figures are lost in the blinding light. They start to shut door after them.
67) 26) dialog: No. But it's somewhere without big worms.
67) 27) text: CAMERA DRAWS BACK and we find that Adam and Barbara are in:
68) 4) dialog: An appointment for what?
68) 6) dialog: We need some help.
68) 12) dialog: Why three?
68) 16) dialog: How long do we have to wait?
68) 19) text: The waiting room is now filled with people.  Dead people, some in fairly awful states.  A cornucopia of carnal shreddage. Adam and Barbara look around for a moment, then very quietly, they reach out to grasp hands.
71) 0) text: Barbara and Adam are still holding hands, as if they hadn't moved.  Like waiting for an IRS audit.
71) 1) dialog: (to Adam) Is this what happens when you die?
71) 2) text: The Receptionist overhears.  She points at Barbara.
71) 6) text: Barbara and Adam look at them.  Corpses resume doing what they were doing.  A GRINDING NOISE O.S. -- The Receptionist looks up. Barbara and Adam also look O.S.
71) 7) text: A Message delivery wire GRINDS along loudly on a pulley.  The actual message is held in the hand of the MESSENGER, a flattened corpse, suspended as if on a shirt clothesline, tire marks on his face and clothing. A major roadkill.  Dust and gravel ground into him.  He smiles wanly at Barbara and Adam as the Receptionist takes a message on a piece of paper and reads it.
71) 9) text: Barbara and Adam upset at the loss of their handbook...
71) 10) dialog: We forgot our handbook.
73) 2) text: Adam and Barbara walk through a door.
74) 0) text: A vast room of desks arranged in a grid, straight out of "How To Succeed In Business"... Each desk is occupied, too, but most of the secretaries are merely skeletons, or mouldering corpses slumped over their typewriters. Only one secretary, somewhere in the vast grid, is typing slowly, with long pauses between words. The Messenger on his return trip, parallels Barbara and Adam as they walk along.  Barbara can't look at him.
74) 4) text: He laughs at his own joke as he goes back through the very, very narrow slot in the wall where the line runs.  Adam and Barbara look to the right and left. A vast stack of files slips off a desk and spills out onto the floor.
75) 0) text: Barbara and Adam enter corridor. Empty, like a hotel corridor, but all the doors are of different types -- a revolving door, a dutch door, church doors.  They walk past a waist-high window, covered by a roll-up shade.
75) 1) dialog: A hundred twenty-five years! I can't believe it.  I can't believe they didn't tell us.
75) 4) dialog: Adam, look at this.
75) 6) dialog: (continuing) Oh, Adam... what is this?
75) 10) text: The man scuttles off.  Adam and Barbara walk on sadly, until they come to a door that looks exactly like the swinging door between the kitchen and dining room of their house.
75) 12) text: Puzzled -- Barbara pushes it.
76) 0) text: Everything is dark, quiet -- but the furniture is obviously not theirs, and neither is the decoration. Adam and Barbara exchange glances, and push on through into the living room.
77) 2) dialog: Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
77) 7) dialog: Are you Juno, our caseworker?
77) 9) dialog: We need help.  We deserve help.
77) 12) dialog: We're very unhappy.
77) 15) dialog: We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
77) 17) dialog: Yes.
78) 0) text: The following conversation takes place as Barbara and Adam follow Juno as she looks around the house and ends up in their attic space.
78) 4) dialog: We don't quite get it.
78) 9) dialog: No.
78) 12) dialog: If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
78) 14) text: Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Puzzled.
79) 2) dialog: What do you mean?  What's he do?
79) 5) text: Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Juno continues.
79) 7) text: Adam and Barbara attempt to interrupt --
79) 11) text: Juno fades.  Gone.  Barbara goes to the model, looks at the cemetery.
79) 12) dialog: That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
82) 2) text: ON Barbara, she stands back away from the door observ- ing skeptically.
83) 0) text: Adam helps Barbara on with her sheet.
83) 1) dialog: God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
84) 0) text: Television still going, Delia asleep with curlers. Adam and Barbara glide inside, go over and stand beside the bed.
86) 0) text: Adam and Barbara moan and groan.  Delia doesn't stir.
86) 1) dialog: I feel really stupid.
86) 3) text: Barbara moans louder and more weirdly. Delia stirs, sits up, but doesn't open her eyes. Adam and Barbara are excited then... disappointed as Delia fumbles on the bedside table for the remote con- trol device, and without opening her eyes, turns off the television set.  Then she turns over, and is lost to the world totally. Barbara sighs.  She and Adam walk toward the door. When they open it however, Lydia is standing there in her pajamas -- she snaps a FLASH Polaroid -- and Adam and Barbara jump backwards with yelps of fright.
86) 7) text: She screams.  Adam and Barbara scream.  Lydia rushes back toward them, starts flashing pictures. Adam and Barbara run around and are pushed into a corner.  Polaroids fly everywhere. Lydia runs out of film.  She stares at them, panting with fear.  A standoff.
86) 10) text: Barbara moans.
86) 12) text: Adam and Barbara pull shut bedroom door, go out into the hall -- as if to keep from waking Delia with their conversation.
87) 5) dialog: (pulling off the sheet) If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
87) 7) dialog: We're practicing.
87) 10) dialog: Tell the truth.
87) 14) dialog: (tenderly) You look like a regular girl to me.
87) 15) text: Lydia blushes.  Barbara smiles warmly.  She is begin- ning to like Lydia.
87) 21) text: Barbara smiles.
87) 23) text: Adam and Barbara look at each other.
87) 24) dialog: Maybe we better talk.
88) 0) text: Adam's rigged up the moon, and stars, too.  Adam and Barbara and Lydia stand just beyond the fringes of the town, dimly lighted giants.
88) 6) dialog: We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
88) 12) dialog: You know you're really a pretty girl.
88) 16) dialog: Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
88) 21) text: Barbara shakes her head, a little ashamed.
88) 23) text: She sneaks a smile at Barbara and exits.
93) 18) text: Barbara follows Lydia out.  Adam thinks, intrigued. Exits.
94) 4) text: Lydia exits angrily. CAMERA HINGES.  Barbara is watching, horrified at Delia's occupation of her (Barbara's) kitchen.  Adam appears.
94) 5) dialog: Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
94) 7) dialog: Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
95) 0) text: Adam looks intently through the book. Barbara's eye is caught by something in the model cemetery.  She moves over and sees a small gravestone lit up by neon.
95) 1) dialog: Adam!
95) 4) dialog: It's him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
95) 7) dialog: (after a deep breath) Betelgeuse!
96) 0) text: WIND BLOWS --  With shovels and lanterns, Adam and Barbara are unlikely gravediggers.  The mechanized clouds move in the sky across the mechanical moon, throwing weird shadows everywhere.  Ground fog creeps slowly along the graves.  It is so eerie.
96) 1) dialog: What happened?
96) 3) dialog: (standing in front of grave) Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The juice of beetles.
96) 5) dialog: (continuing) Where is he?  What do we do?
96) 8) dialog: Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves. My nails keep getting longer. I'll break them.
97) 1) dialog: It's about time.
97) 4) dialog: Maybe we should knock first?
97) 10) dialog: We're...
97) 15) dialog: Just get some people out of our house.
97) 17) dialog: Just one daughter.
97) 19) text: Air blows up Barbara's dress, exposing her legs.  He leers.
97) 20) dialog: She's only fourteen...
97) 23) text: Barbara is grossed out and increasingly uneasy.  Beetle Juice senses it and gets back to business.
97) 32) dialog: (decisively) Honey.  Let's go.
97) 34) dialog: No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
97) 36) dialog: grabs Adam.  Betelgeuse is getting mad.  Not pretty.
97) 38) dialog: Home.  Home.  Home!
98) 0) text: A small tree falls in the model.  Adam, across the room, walks over and straightens it. He looks at Barbara who is poring over the handbook. Making notes.  Counting out procedures.
98) 2) dialog: I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
98) 4) dialog: (proud of herself) Just a hunch... remember things come in threes -- three times in, three times out... I'm getting the hang of this stuff.
98) 6) dialog: I don't care...
98) 8) dialog: I've changed my mind... I feel really confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea. You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
102) 0) text: Adam and Barbara with huge smiles on their faces, dance the bugaloo then hug and kiss on the landing in front of the attic.  Door is open.
102) 7) dialog: Your Ink Spots were wonderful!
102) 10) dialog: My shrimp?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
102) 12) dialog: Who did the?
102) 13) text: Timid KNOCK at the door of the attic. Barbara glances at Adam.  They don't know what to do.

109) 4) dialog: I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have killed him.
109) 8) text: Angry, Barbara reaches down into the model and plucks Betelgeuse up. Barbara lifts him up toward her, squeezing him slightly.
109) 9) dialog: You leave her alone, you horrid little prick!

128) 1) dialog: We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us.  Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to things.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us.  We didn't have room for anyone.
