35) 12) text: That's the cue for CHARLES DEETZ, who comes in through the swinging door, and across the dining room... a ner- vous but basically pleasant man, CHARLES DEETZ is intent on attacking rest and relaxation with the same vengeance that earned him millions in real estate.
35) 13) dialog: The noise in that kitchen.  Noisy refrigerator, noisy faucets... We'll have to replace it all.  I want no humming in the house.
35) 15) dialog: (to Lydia) What do you think, honey?
35) 25) dialog: Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
35) 29) text: Delia turns to Charles and Lydia for help -- doesn't get it -- and at last pulls Otho into the living room single-handedly. All this while the Moving Men are variously carting out the handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous new furniture. Otho is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and faggoty.  But he's not all fat and fun -- this customer carries nasty emotional weight as well.
35) 36) dialog: That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me out of it.  I am here to relax and clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
38) 3) text: There is one slight difference, however, because on the rag rug in the middle of the floor lies Adam's headless corpse.  Standing over him, holding in one hand a long knife and in the other Adam's blood-and-gore dripping head is Barbara -- with a maniacal look on her face. Behind them, Charles is thumbing through Adam's Audubon collection.  He sits up like a cornered animal protect- ing his territory.
38) 4) dialog: (to Otho and Delia) This room is off limits.  I don't want either of you to touch one piece of furniture in here.  This is my room.
44) 0) text: Barbara still holding Adam's head. Charles still calmly leafing through the Audubons.
45) 0) text: Adam turns away from the window. Barbara, fuming, moves around Charles making wild gestures.
50) 2) dialog: There's only one Chinese restaurant out here, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
50) 5) dialog: Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
50) 9) text: Delia laughs.  Charles smiles.
50) 11) dialog: Lydia, in a couple of years this whole town will be filled with people like us.
50) 15) dialog: (smiles) Good idea!
50) 16) text: Delia shifts her glare to Charles.
50) 19) text: young. (back to business) Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door. Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
50) 20) dialog: We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming.
50) 22) dialog: Should have it fumigated, too.  I saw a fly today.
54) 0) text: Charles, away from the chaos outside is calmly steeping a mug of herb tea.  His solitude is interrupted by a 2500 lb. Vulcan range breaking through a too-small kitchen window.
54) 1) dialog: (shouting through the window) What the hell are you trying to do out there?
62) 0) text: Lydia listens.  Did she hear something?  She puts her hand on the knob and tries to turn it.  It's stuck. Then the key eerily pops out of the lock and falls on the floor. Charles' head suddenly appears behind her.  Scares her.
62) 1) dialog: What are you doing?
64) 2) dialog: Let me have it.
65) 4) dialog: Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Where's your mother?
65) 6) dialog: I'm going down to relax.  I want a noise-free zone.  Do you understand?  Noise-free.
65) 10) dialog: (irritated, over his shoulder) What?
65) 12) text: A BLAST OF STEAM from below drowns out her words. Charles stops and turns around.  The BLAST STOPS.
65) 13) dialog: What?
65) 16) text: Charles continues.  She begins to follow slowly.
67) 0) text: Charles, fiercely intent on relaxing, paces like a catfish out of water.  Ralph Lauren in K-mart.  He stretches.  He sits uneasily in an easy chair, tries like hell to get comfortable.  Finally, he puts a book under his bottom to get sitting straight.  Looks around tapping his fingers.  What to do?  Looks at watch. He takes down a book from Adam's library, it is an Audubon book of birds.  He whips through it like it's the comics and then looks around for more. He finds the "Illustrated Walden" by Thoreau.  He speed reads it. He is now really bored.  Goes to the fireplace, tries to light it.  Cannot do it.  Goes to desk and writes:
67) 5) dialog: Jesus Christ!
67) 7) dialog: (continuing) Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
67) 9) dialog: Lydia.  What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  Go help your mother.
67) 10) text: Charles returns to field glasses, spies something.  She looks at him in frustration.
67) 12) text: She exits.  Charles peers after her, brow furrowed. Looks out again at the village.  Uses his field glasses to get a better look.
67) 15) dialog: Nice building... Bad paint.  Good lines... bad roof.  Good parking... hmmm???
67) 18) dialog: Yes, I'd like to speak with Maxie Dean.
67) 20) dialog: Well tell him that Charles Deetz called.
67) 22) dialog: (continuing) My God what I could do with that parking.
72) 1) dialog: (from distant downstairs) Lydia, Delia needs your help!
72) 3) dialog: Right now, Delia says!
80) 0) text: Charles is on the phone.  He has drawings laid out in front of him.  He is at his most urban persuasive, and oddly relaxed -- he is finally in his own element.
80) 1) dialog: Maxie, have I not always made you money?  I think that is the only real question here.
81) 0) text: New York office, cool design, black couch, and MAXIE DEAN, a 55-year-old, super tan, white-haired wheeler dealer.  Sign says:  CHAIRMAN of BOTCO INDUSTRIES. Maxie looks rich and he looks cool as he talks to Charles.  Behind him, Sarah, his rich-looking blonde wife, is looking at herself in a mirror.
81) 3) dialog: Not a building!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the whole town.  These people don't know the value of their property!
81) 5) dialog: No, No -- C'mon, Max, you know me.  I've got plans.  You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it.
81) 8) text: This burns Charles.  But he swallows it.  He hears something in the corridor outside -- a kind of LOW MOANING.
81) 9) dialog: (into telephone) Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody.
81) 11) dialog: (torn between the MOANING and Maxie) Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could run it for us.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
82) 0) text: Charles hangs up frustrated.  MOANING INCREASES.  He goes to the door and flings it open. A figure is right there in the doorway -- A ghost under a sheet.  But a "designer" sheet.  He wails away like a banshee.  Eyeholes cut in sheets, Charles jumps, re- covers.
82) 1) dialog: Oh, Jesus, Lydia!  Is Connecticut so boring that you have to think up shit like this?
82) 3) dialog: (continuing) I had Maxie Dean on the phone! Darling, Dad's found a way to make some money here while I relax, so scram!
82) 5) dialog: (continuing) And your mother is going to kill you when she sees that you cut holes in her $300 sheets.  You provoke her you know.  I mean she can be an unreasonable bitch.  But you do provoke her.
88) 14) dialog: Lydia!
93) 0) text: Lydia rushes in.  Charles is working furiously on a word processor, amidst an array of maps and plans.
93) 2) dialog: Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
93) 4) dialog: ... sheets.
93) 6) dialog: Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
93) 10) text: Charles laughs.
93) 12) text: Charles begins to scroll through computer program.
93) 13) dialog: (dismissing it) Very clever, Lydia.  Now would you please -- I'll tell you what... I know!  You're bored, right?  You take that camera and your bike and photograph every building in town.  Don't tell anyone what it's for... (handing her a wad of bills) Here, take some cash and go do it.  How's that?  You want to stretch, don't you?
93) 14) text: Lydia exits, with determination.  Charles looks up on the wall and runs his finger over a plat map of Winter River, just like Adam's in the attic.
93) 15) dialog: (continuing) Look at the size of these lots...
99) 2) dialog: (privately; to Otho) Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
99) 4) dialog: He's your cousin.
99) 20) text: Charles, seeing things aren't going well for Delia, proposes a toast.
99) 21) dialog: I propose a toast to our intrepid friends.  Who braved the expressway and fourteen toll booths to visit us.  May your buildings go condo.
99) 24) text: Charles lifts the wine bottle from the cooler.  Disgust spans the room. ON bottle -- it bears the familiar spread wings of Thunderbird!
99) 27) text: Delia stares a spike through Lydia.  Delia and Charles rush into the kitchen.  Otho looks at his glass and peers at Lydia.
100) 0) text: Delia rushes to get the sushi.  Charles finds some good wine.
101) 0) text: Lydia is looking around curiously.  Delia and Charles rush back in with sushi and good wine.  Delia pours for Bernard, the obvious connoisseur.  He tastes the wine. All wait.  Is it Kerosene du Pape?  He smiles.  All smile. Otho is more interested in Lydia's story.  He leans toward her...
101) 8) text: Lydia's eyes widen.  MUSIC UP.  All the guests are spellbound. Charles, too, has the beat -- The Ink Spots in his eyes. In a voice not his own.
101) 9) dialog: "If my every prayer, did not begin and end with just your name."
103) 0) text: The guests are sitting expectantly.  The photographs are being passed around.  The wheels are turning in Charles' mind --  he sees a gold mine.  Everyone speaks at once.
103) 3) dialog: People will pay big money for this.  Right, Grace?
103) 6) text: Charles is scheming.
103) 9) text: Charles plots and plans.
103) 26) dialog: The attic room is locked --
104) 0) text: Delia, Charles, Otho and Lydia -- creep, creep.
105) 0) text: Lydia is pushed in first.  She looks around.  Delia, Charles and Otho come in next, carefully.  One by one they straighten up and look around.
105) 3) dialog: (off-handedly) Answer your mother.
105) 5) text: Charles is suddenly transfixed.  He stares at the model.
105) 6) dialog: It's the whole damn town.
105) 10) dialog: Look at all that parking!
107) 0) text: Delia, Charles and Otho all start down the stairs, one by one.  All are holding the handrail.
107) 3) dialog: (fixing on Otho) Now, let's get back to business.  I I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
107) 5) dialog: Delia will cook...
107) 7) dialog: (continuing) I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia -- you'll bring the ghosts.
107) 9) dialog: ... Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
113) 0) text: Charles sits at the table with a small bandage on his head.  Delia takes off her Gucci belt and whips it on a chair absent-mindedly.
113) 2) dialog: At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
113) 4) dialog: What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
113) 6) dialog: Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town. I need Max's financing...
113) 8) dialog: Why not?
121) 17) text: Without noticing Lydia, Otho and Charles push in through the door and grab the model.  They take it out the door. Adam is beside himself.  Doesn't know what to do. Barbara stops him from taking action.
123) 0) text: Lydia walks into a presentation in progress.  Sitting around the table are Otho, Maxie, and Delia.  Sarah Dean is there, too.  She looks around Lydia hoping for ghosts.  Sarah is heavily made up, smells bad. Lydia's photos of the sheeted ghosts are blown up and standing on a nearby easel.  Charles, over the model with a pointer, is lost in mid-sentence.
123) 1) dialog: -- In short, I've got options to buy enough of Main Street to control the city council for a hundred years.  And at the prices I'm talking about, if it all fell apart tomorrow, we just move out and sell to the Arabs and we still come out... I've talked to Ed Cornwall about a wax museum, here... in Thanksgiving Park... Ed's the man who made the talking Jesse Jackson statue. And I've got a museum dedicated to 50 Great Moments in the Paranormal -- and parenthetically, D-Con wants to the right to start an insect zoo here in the old hardware store. (seeing Lydia) Lydia, did you finally decide to join us?
123) 3) dialog: Honey, I am just finishing the first phase presentation about our little project here.  Then we'll take a stretch and invite our friends... to meet your friends.
123) 9) dialog: (smiling apologetically) Nonsense, every time she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
123) 15) dialog: Are they still here, Otho?
123) 19) dialog: They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
123) 22) dialog: Otho, can you do it?
131) 4) dialog: Are they suffering?
132) 20) dialog: All right, that's enough.  Can you stop this now?
132) 22) dialog: (continuing) Otho?
134) 38) text: Betelgeuse waves a hand and Lydia's mouth freezes. Delia and Charles plead with the recovering Maitlands.
134) 42) text: Betelgeuse shifts his glare to Charles and Delia. From Behind, Delia's horrid sculptures come to life and attack Charles and Delia.  The sculptures twist around them, forcing them to watch the hideous spectacle. Adam and Barbara are rapidly trying to recover as the ceremony begins.
134) 89) text: Barbara leaps off, as the Sand Worm continues down through the floorboards of the house Betelgeuse is gone.  Adam is back to full size. Charles and Delia are no longer held by the sculptures. Lydia runs back to her family and Adam and Barbara. The dust settles.
140) 0) text: We recognize the furniture.  It's the Deetzes'.  Delia is on the phone to Jane.  Charles comes in with the Wall Street Journal.  He fidgets, taps his fingers, as he reads and pours coffee -- all at once.
140) 2) text: Charles picks up the extension.
140) 3) dialog: Listen to me, Jane.  We don't want anyone looking at the house.  We don't want it painted, the yard
142) 2) text: She hangs up.  Looks at Charles.
142) 4) text: Charles smiles.
