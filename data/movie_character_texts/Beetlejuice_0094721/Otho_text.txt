35) 22) dialog: Help!  Oh help!
35) 26) text: Otho's voice comes as if from a great distance.
35) 27) dialog: It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
35) 29) text: Delia turns to Charles and Lydia for help -- doesn't get it -- and at last pulls Otho into the living room single-handedly. All this while the Moving Men are variously carting out the handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous new furniture. Otho is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and faggoty.  But he's not all fat and fun -- this customer carries nasty emotional weight as well.
35) 30) dialog: holds onto the curtains for support as he is pulled through the window.  And when he is at last all the way through, and upright on his feet, he suddenly gives a tremendous yank.  The whole drapery apparatus, including valences, crashes to the floor.
35) 31) dialog: That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
35) 33) text: Otho is looking around the room with an eye of quiet horror.
35) 34) dialog: Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house. And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place.  We are talking from
35) 37) text: He exits to find solace in a quiet corner of his house. During this speech, Otho has been surreptitiously pos- ing for Lydia's camera.  She clicks the shutter.
35) 38) dialog: (ignoring her) Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
35) 40) dialog: No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
35) 41) text: Out of the pockets of his size 56 Georgia Armani jacket, Otho takes two cans of spray paint -- the kind the graffiti artists use -- and shakes them as if they were castanets.  They certainly sound like it.
35) 42) dialog: Delia, let's get this show on the road.
36) 7) text: Barbara is shocked at the reality. Otho and Delia come up the stairs at the end of the hallway.
36) 8) dialog: We're dealing with negative entertainment potential here.  I mean, there's absolutely no organic walking flow-through.
36) 9) text: Otho looks down the hallway.  It's empty.  Adam and Barbara are no longer there.
36) 11) dialog: I thought I saw something.
36) 14) dialog: (screaming with delight) You read my mind!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior design and the supernatural.
36) 17) dialog: Gooood!
37) 2) dialog: Viridian?
37) 4) text: Otho spray-paints the word VIRIDIAN on the wall -- plus the word BLUE GREEN -- and Cr2 03, right over a picture of Adam and Barbara as kids.
37) 5) dialog: Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a science, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho. (looking at wall) And this patient is truly sick!
37) 7) text: Delia smiles.  Behind Delia and Otho, the room's closet door swings slowly open with and ominous CREAK.
37) 10) dialog: We just have to pray that the other closets are bigger than this one.
37) 12) dialog: (continuing) Were these people dwarfes? (sic) (spies something) Oooooo!...  Look!
37) 14) dialog: (continuing) Ozzie... (holding up her dress) ... and... Harriet!  What happened to these people?
38) 0) text: Delia and Otho come out of Lydia's bedroom and go through the bathroom.  Disgusted, they continue on to the study.
38) 1) dialog: reaches out and turns the knob.  The door swings omi- nously open on Charles' study.  This had been Adam's reading and birdwatching study.  Bird posters on the wall, books everywhere.  Straight out of Better Homes and Gardens 1963.
38) 2) dialog: Ooo.  Deliver me from L.L. Bean!
38) 11) dialog: (looking around scientifically) Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place might just be livable. What's on the third floor?
38) 13) dialog: Let's see.  We could turn that into a media room.
40) 0) text: Otho and Delia climbing.  The headless corpse careens past them, around the bend in the stairs and out of sight.
40) 1) dialog: Did you feel something?
40) 3) dialog: (continuing) I felt a cool wind.
40) 4) text: The expression on Otho's face suggests he knows more than he's telling.
43) 1) dialog: You don't have a key?
43) 3) dialog: I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
99) 0) text: Dinner for seven, as promised.  Everything looks very nice.  Deetzes are in control and in their element. The element is neurotic-chic. Some of the guests are affecting distaste for having had to make the long drive to Connecticut.  There's a bitchy feud going on between GRACE, the "Art In Amer- ica" writer, and BERNARD, Delia's agent, that threatens to become a full-scale war. Otho is drunkish and engaged in his third favorite occupation -- direct attacks on the personal weaknesses of his friends.  He's singled out his victim, BERYL, the editor for Ballantine, a frail-looking woman who is dressed "artistically."
99) 1) dialog: (to Beryl) Well, darling, you can only have a hysterectomy once, so why don't you tell us what you really went into the hospital for last week?  Or dare I ask, is that a nose "nouveau?"
99) 3) dialog: He's a cloven-hooved beast!
99) 5) dialog: I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives. (still on Beryl's case) I just hope it wasn't yet another of your dreary suicide attempts.  You know what they say about people who who commit suicide.  In the afterlife, they become civil servants.
99) 7) dialog: Of course you remember!  After my stint with the living theatre.  I was one of New York City's leading paranormal researchers until the bottom dropped out of the business in '72.
99) 9) text: Lydia watches Otho thoughtfully.  Suddenly very cur- ious. Delia senses that Lydia might talk ghosts here.
99) 16) text: Otho's glance sharpens at this.  Everyone else listens.
99) 27) text: Delia stares a spike through Lydia.  Delia and Charles rush into the kitchen.  Otho looks at his glass and peers at Lydia.
101) 0) text: Lydia is looking around curiously.  Delia and Charles rush back in with sushi and good wine.  Delia pours for Bernard, the obvious connoisseur.  He tastes the wine. All wait.  Is it Kerosene du Pape?  He smiles.  All smile. Otho is more interested in Lydia's story.  He leans toward her...
101) 1) dialog: Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
101) 3) dialog: Oh, Delia, lighten up!
103) 2) dialog: We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect.  Nurture them.
103) 8) dialog: No matter how drunk you get, you cannot sound like the Ink Spots. (to Charles) Charles, this is it!  You can get Maxie Dean up here now.
103) 10) dialog: His wife Sarah loves the supernatural.  I did a reading for her just last week.  Told her her jowls would tighten soon.  I mean she will make him sprint up here in his helicopter if you can produce ghosts for her.
103) 15) dialog: Why not?
103) 24) dialog: All presences have a home space.  A place where they live, so to speak. Where do they hide out?
103) 28) dialog: Fabulous!  Otho Fenlock's "Locked Door" ghosts!  Probably committed suicide up there -- hanging like beeves from the rafters.  I'm totally enchanted.
104) 0) text: Delia, Charles, Otho and Lydia -- creep, creep.
105) 0) text: Lydia is pushed in first.  She looks around.  Delia, Charles and Otho come in next, carefully.  One by one they straighten up and look around.
105) 8) dialog: Look at that detail!
105) 12) dialog: They're not here, Lydia?
105) 13) text: She shakes her head.  Otho spots the handbook.  Palms it.
105) 17) text: Otho pockets the handbook secretly as everyone exits. Delia carefully closes the door.
107) 0) text: Delia, Charles and Otho all start down the stairs, one by one.  All are holding the handrail.
107) 10) dialog: (pats the handbook under his coat) Perhaps... if I were properly motivated...
121) 17) text: Without noticing Lydia, Otho and Charles push in through the door and grab the model.  They take it out the door. Adam is beside himself.  Doesn't know what to do. Barbara stops him from taking action.
123) 0) text: Lydia walks into a presentation in progress.  Sitting around the table are Otho, Maxie, and Delia.  Sarah Dean is there, too.  She looks around Lydia hoping for ghosts.  Sarah is heavily made up, smells bad. Lydia's photos of the sheeted ghosts are blown up and standing on a nearby easel.  Charles, over the model with a pointer, is lost in mid-sentence.
123) 14) text: The whole room turns to Otho.  Who is scribbling some- thing and mumbling.
123) 16) text: Otho looks up; he missed the question.
123) 18) dialog: Oh, they're still here.  They're just not showing up.
123) 23) dialog: It's tricky, but I think I can handle it.
123) 28) dialog: (taking the challenge) I'll need something personal of theirs.
126) 4) dialog: (dramatically) Their wedding clothes.
126) 5) text: Otho then holds up the handbook.
126) 7) text: Otho nods.
127) 0) text: Lydia is nervous now.  Otho lights a candle and Delia turns out the lights.
127) 1) dialog: Hands vermillion / start of five bright cotillion / raven's dive nightshades promise / spirit's strive, to the living / let now the dead... come alive.
129) 2) dialog: As sudden thunder / Pierces the night; As magic wonder / Mad affright Rives asunder / Man's delight: Our ghost, our corpse and we Rise to be.
129) 9) dialog: (louder) As flies the lizard / Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, / At the spell Of pale wizard, / Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
131) 3) dialog: I don't know.
132) 21) text: Otho doesn't answer.
132) 23) dialog: It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
134) 27) dialog: No.  Noooo!  My God.  It's Giorgio
134) 30) text: Otho is horrified.  Suddenly he looks down and sees his clothing has transformed into a polyester nightmare. He runs out the door screaming.  Betelgeuese laughs with delight then focuses on Lydia.
