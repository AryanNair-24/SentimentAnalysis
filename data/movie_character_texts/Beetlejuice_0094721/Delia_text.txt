35) 4) dialog: Don't worry.  It was going anyway.
35) 5) text: Delia is relentlessly New York, relentlessly fashion- able, relentlessly thin -- totally self assured. She is also a woman with a mission -- to gut Barbara and Adam's house and remake it in her own very upscale image. Delia's gaze is on the living room, but she looks  through Adam and Barbara as if they weren't even there (which to her eyes they're not). Still holding the baluster, Delia gets up off the couch and moves into the living room, surveying it with an odd mixture of ambition, and resolution.
35) 7) dialog: (continuing) Jesus.  Who lived here?  The Waltons?
35) 8) text: TIGHT ON Lydia -- calmly surveys the house. Delia signals wearily that the Moving Men can put the chair down anywhere.
35) 9) dialog: (continuing) Get all this other crap out of here.
35) 11) dialog: (continuing) Where is your father?... probably in the kitchen.
35) 19) text: A movement makes Lydia turn around and scream.  It is Delia.  Not Barbara.
35) 20) dialog: Settle down, Lydia.  I wonder where we are going to get counseling for you out here.
35) 24) dialog: It's Otho!
35) 28) dialog: Hold your breath and we'll pull.
35) 29) text: Delia turns to Charles and Lydia for help -- doesn't get it -- and at last pulls Otho into the living room single-handedly. All this while the Moving Men are variously carting out the handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous new furniture. Otho is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and faggoty.  But he's not all fat and fun -- this customer carries nasty emotional weight as well.
35) 32) dialog: (starry eyed) I'm so glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
35) 39) dialog: The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
36) 7) text: Barbara is shocked at the reality. Otho and Delia come up the stairs at the end of the hallway.
36) 10) dialog: What's wrong?
36) 12) text: DeLia turns and spray-paints on the wall -- in luminous orange -- the word MAUVE.
36) 13) dialog: Okay?
36) 15) dialog: (fawning) I know... I read your book, The
36) 18) text: Delia opens the door and they step inside another room.
36) 19) dialog: This will be Lydia's room.
37) 1) dialog: What do you think?
37) 3) dialog: Viridian?  What is...?
37) 6) dialog: Of course, her favorite color! How beautiful!
37) 7) text: Delia smiles.  Behind Delia and Otho, the room's closet door swings slowly open with and ominous CREAK.
37) 9) dialog: Oh my God!
37) 13) text: He finds, neatly hung in plastic, the Maitlands' wedding outfits.  Totally captivated by this powerful image, he peers through the plastic at them.  Holding each up to Delia.  Barbara watches wide-eyed at them.
37) 15) text: Delia slams the door in Barbara's contorted face.
37) 16) dialog: They died.
38) 0) text: Delia and Otho come out of Lydia's bedroom and go through the bathroom.  Disgusted, they continue on to the study.
38) 7) text: Outside, Delia is shaking her head.
38) 8) dialog: The woman who lived here had the aesthetic instincts of Betty Crocker.
38) 10) dialog: I cannot convey to you the extent to which this house bores me.
38) 12) dialog: Attic space.
40) 0) text: Otho and Delia climbing.  The headless corpse careens past them, around the bend in the stairs and out of sight.
40) 2) text: Delia shakes her head.
43) 0) text: Delia tries the knob.  The door is locked.
43) 2) dialog: Maybe Charles does.
43) 4) dialog: (sarcastic) Probably the world's largest Reader's Digest collection! C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
50) 1) dialog: I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
50) 4) dialog: This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
50) 7) text: Delia rolls her eyes and nods.  She's been through this before.
50) 8) dialog: Nonsense... you'll go to school, maybe meet a farm boy.
50) 9) text: Delia laughs.  Charles smiles.
50) 12) dialog: We'll be the art center of summer New York.  I'll start sculpting again... I'll teach those gallery bastards to refuse my sculpture. And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
50) 14) text: Delia stares at Lydia.
50) 16) text: Delia shifts her glare to Charles.
50) 18) dialog: Lydia, at your age, you are so
50) 21) dialog: ... and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it.
54) 2) dialog: is berating the inept crane operator and shrieks periodically at some fine art movers who are struggling under her horrid modern welded steel sculptures.
54) 17) dialog: Help!  Get off me!
54) 18) text: Lydia drops the skeleton key into her pocket surrepti- tiously.  She follows Delia's SHRIEKING.
55) 0) text: Lydia rounds the corner to see Delia, pinned flat against the house by one of her horrid steel sculp- tures.  Two movers are struggling to free her.  Lydia snaps a quick photograph. They finally free Delia.  She clutches at her head, just short of tearing her hair out.
55) 1) dialog: You jerks!  That is my art, and it is dangerous!  You think I want to want to die like that? (seeing Lydia) Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
55) 3) dialog: Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!
77) 19) text: He indicates a particularly bad piece of Delia's sculp- ture.  Juno walks around it shaking her head.
84) 0) text: Television still going, Delia asleep with curlers. Adam and Barbara glide inside, go over and stand beside the bed.
86) 0) text: Adam and Barbara moan and groan.  Delia doesn't stir.
86) 3) text: Barbara moans louder and more weirdly. Delia stirs, sits up, but doesn't open her eyes. Adam and Barbara are excited then... disappointed as Delia fumbles on the bedside table for the remote con- trol device, and without opening her eyes, turns off the television set.  Then she turns over, and is lost to the world totally. Barbara sighs.  She and Adam walk toward the door. When they open it however, Lydia is standing there in her pajamas -- she snaps a FLASH Polaroid -- and Adam and Barbara jump backwards with yelps of fright.
86) 12) text: Adam and Barbara pull shut bedroom door, go out into the hall -- as if to keep from waking Delia with their conversation.
91) 0) text: Delia shrieks.  Going through the dirty clothes, she's just come across the sheets with the eye holes in them.
91) 1) dialog: Lydia!  Lydia!  My hands are shredded from doing the laundry, and now I have to deal with your vandalism!
92) 0) text: Lydia, pounding up from the basement with the wet print, collides with Delia, rushing down from the sec- ond floor with the scissored sheets.
92) 1) dialog: Lydia, honest to God I'm going to kill you.  I'm having a party tonight.  I'm cooking, I can't get servants.  Do I need angst?  No, I certainly do not!
92) 3) dialog: (continuing) You owe me three-hundred bucks, Lydia!  Don't go running to your father, you worm.
94) 0) text: Delia is frantically preparing for the evening's dinner party.  Lydia is very much in her way, trying to show her the photographs.  Delia isn't looking at them.
94) 1) dialog: I can't believe you are doing this to me!  Ghosts.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for "Art in America."  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in "Vanity Fair."  Except you.
94) 3) dialog: Don't you dare talk to others about me.  I'm an artist!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
94) 4) text: Lydia exits angrily. CAMERA HINGES.  Barbara is watching, horrified at Delia's occupation of her (Barbara's) kitchen.  Adam appears.
99) 0) text: Dinner for seven, as promised.  Everything looks very nice.  Deetzes are in control and in their element. The element is neurotic-chic. Some of the guests are affecting distaste for having had to make the long drive to Connecticut.  There's a bitchy feud going on between GRACE, the "Art In Amer- ica" writer, and BERNARD, Delia's agent, that threatens to become a full-scale war. Otho is drunkish and engaged in his third favorite occupation -- direct attacks on the personal weaknesses of his friends.  He's singled out his victim, BERYL, the editor for Ballantine, a frail-looking woman who is dressed "artistically."
99) 9) text: Lydia watches Otho thoughtfully.  Suddenly very cur- ious. Delia senses that Lydia might talk ghosts here.
99) 10) dialog: (a threat; quietly to Lydia) Don't you dare.
99) 13) dialog: (interrupting) Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
99) 15) dialog: Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
99) 19) dialog: (laughing it away) In sheets yet.  Designer sheets. They --
99) 20) text: Charles, seeing things aren't going well for Delia, proposes a toast.
99) 26) dialog: (horrified; but recovering) Joke Joke!  Charles get the good wine and I'll serve the shrimp. It's a joke.
99) 27) text: Delia stares a spike through Lydia.  Delia and Charles rush into the kitchen.  Otho looks at his glass and peers at Lydia.
100) 0) text: Delia rushes to get the sushi.  Charles finds some good wine.
100) 1) dialog: (rapidly; furious) Lydia switched wines.  Charles -- if you do not agree right now, to boarding school, you can forget having what you call sex -- ever again in your natural lifetime.
101) 0) text: Lydia is looking around curiously.  Delia and Charles rush back in with sushi and good wine.  Delia pours for Bernard, the obvious connoisseur.  He tastes the wine. All wait.  Is it Kerosene du Pape?  He smiles.  All smile. Otho is more interested in Lydia's story.  He leans toward her...
101) 2) dialog: No!  Do not encourage this little... person.
101) 4) dialog: She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
101) 6) dialog: Something comes over her -- she straightens, then crouches a little, her hand sweeps across in front of her, almost mechanically.  And then our Delia Deetz, unable to help herself, leaves the whitebread world behind and possessed, sings in someone else's voice, a rich, NEGRO TENOR.
101) 7) dialog: "If I didn't care, More than words could say."
101) 10) text: Delia is shocked.  She looks at Lydia.
101) 11) dialog: For God's sake, stop me...
101) 13) dialog: "I could not be true to you beyond compare."
101) 16) dialog: "If I didn't care... for you..."
101) 18) text: A look of sheer delight comes across Lydia's face, unlike anything we have previously seen.  She dances and claps her hands in time with the music.  She is in teen heaven. NOTE:  Delia and the guests are fully aware of their singing/actions, but helpless to stop themselves.  While it is funny, it is nevertheless just a little frighten- ing. Lydia excitedly looks around the room to see if she can see the ghosts.  She can't. Now the song pauses... Everyone tries to recover for a shocked second.  Instead, the tempo changes. As the tempo quickens, the guest/chorus is syncopated like alternating pistons as they are pushed and pulled into their chairs.  They sing throughout.
103) 1) dialog: It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in sheets!
103) 5) dialog: (now changing her tune) We were waiting for proof. Lydia's photographs...
103) 18) dialog: Of course we weren't scared. (looking around) Just a little startled.  One of those shrimp dropped down my Kamali.
103) 22) dialog: This was not a hallucination, people.  This was real, really totally real.
103) 31) text: They exit.  Delia is horrified and embarrassed.
103) 32) dialog: Wait!  I'm going to get to the bottom of this!  Lydia, is this some high-tech trick of yours?  I want you to take us up there tout sweet!
104) 0) text: Delia, Charles, Otho and Lydia -- creep, creep.
104) 1) dialog: (whispering) Shhh.  They're in there?  God, they live like animals.  This is where they've been hiding out?
104) 2) text: Lydia nods.  Delia suddenly, brashly pounds on the door.
104) 3) dialog: (shouting) All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
104) 5) dialog: It doesn't matter. What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud. (to Lydia) I am going to teach you something here Lydia.  You've got to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all over you. (loud) Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never lived!
104) 6) text: Delia pounds on door, which opens with an eerie CREAK.
105) 0) text: Lydia is pushed in first.  She looks around.  Delia, Charles and Otho come in next, carefully.  One by one they straighten up and look around.
105) 1) dialog: (whisper) So where are they, Lydia?
105) 9) dialog: Look at the tiny figures.
105) 14) dialog: I have never been so embarrassed... They haven't gone for good, have they?
105) 15) text: Delia is suddenly out the door, urging them all outside.
105) 16) dialog: (continuing) Everyone out of there.  If they're in there somewhere, I don't want to scare them away.  Come on now, stay out of there.  We've got work to do.
105) 17) text: Otho pockets the handbook secretly as everyone exits. Delia carefully closes the door.
107) 0) text: Delia, Charles and Otho all start down the stairs, one by one.  All are holding the handrail.
107) 1) dialog: Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
107) 6) text: Delia glares at him.
113) 0) text: Charles sits at the table with a small bandage on his head.  Delia takes off her Gucci belt and whips it on a chair absent-mindedly.
113) 1) dialog: I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
113) 3) dialog: Otho'll know what to do.
113) 5) dialog: Otho knows just as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior design.
113) 7) dialog: Just don't tell Lydia.
113) 9) dialog: I think she's in with them.
123) 0) text: Lydia walks into a presentation in progress.  Sitting around the table are Otho, Maxie, and Delia.  Sarah Dean is there, too.  She looks around Lydia hoping for ghosts.  Sarah is heavily made up, smells bad. Lydia's photos of the sheeted ghosts are blown up and standing on a nearby easel.  Charles, over the model with a pointer, is lost in mid-sentence.
123) 12) text: Sarah is disappointed.  She goes to Maxie.  Delia takes over.
123) 13) dialog: She's become a little emotional about all this.  No counseling up here.  But we aren't relying on her.  No, we rely on professionals.  We have... Otho.
123) 17) dialog: Are they still here, Otho?
123) 20) dialog: Not these people!  They are ruthless!
123) 30) text: Delia gets an idea.
126) 0) text: Delia carefully brings out a big plastic bag.  Lays something out on the dining room table.
126) 1) dialog: I'm deeply sentimental about... weddings.
126) 2) text: Lydia stands to see:  Delia carefully lays out Barbara's white wedding dress.  Then next to it, Adam's wedding tux. Lydia looks at it.  A chill runs through her.
127) 0) text: Lydia is nervous now.  Otho lights a candle and Delia turns out the lights.
131) 2) dialog: What's happening to them?
134) 38) text: Betelgeuse waves a hand and Lydia's mouth freezes. Delia and Charles plead with the recovering Maitlands.
134) 39) dialog: (frantic) Please, can't you do something! Please!
134) 42) text: Betelgeuse shifts his glare to Charles and Delia. From Behind, Delia's horrid sculptures come to life and attack Charles and Delia.  The sculptures twist around them, forcing them to watch the hideous spectacle. Adam and Barbara are rapidly trying to recover as the ceremony begins.
134) 89) text: Barbara leaps off, as the Sand Worm continues down through the floorboards of the house Betelgeuse is gone.  Adam is back to full size. Charles and Delia are no longer held by the sculptures. Lydia runs back to her family and Adam and Barbara. The dust settles.
140) 0) text: We recognize the furniture.  It's the Deetzes'.  Delia is on the phone to Jane.  Charles comes in with the Wall Street Journal.  He fidgets, taps his fingers, as he reads and pours coffee -- all at once.
140) 1) dialog: (whisper to Charles) It's Mrs. Butterworth again.
142) 1) dialog: (smiles) Never, honey.  Never.
142) 3) dialog: (continuing) Some people never know when to leave things the way they are.
