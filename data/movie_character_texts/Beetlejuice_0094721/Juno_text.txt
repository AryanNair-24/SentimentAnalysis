77) 4) dialog: Three months.
77) 5) text: A spot comes on, revealing JUNO -- their caseworker. She's an older woman, no nonsense about her.  Over- dressed in an outfit that includes a blouse with ruffled cuffs.  We will at some point catch a glimpse of her slashed throat -- she smokes heavily.  Occa- sionaly smoke puffs from her cut throat.
77) 6) dialog: I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
77) 8) dialog: Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
77) 11) dialog: No. (beat) What's wrong?
77) 13) dialog: What do you expect?  You're dead.
77) 16) dialog: -- like you used to be?
77) 19) text: He indicates a particularly bad piece of Delia's sculp- ture.  Juno walks around it shaking her head.
78) 0) text: The following conversation takes place as Barbara and Adam follow Juno as she looks around the house and ends up in their attic space.
78) 1) dialog: Things seem pretty quiet here. You should thank God you didn't die in Italy. (checking the file) The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
78) 3) dialog: The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
78) 5) text: Juno's watch BUZZES, she stops it.
78) 6) dialog: I heard. (refers to her file) Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
78) 8) dialog: Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves.  Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
78) 10) dialog: Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville. (reminiscing) He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off... I've got a plane load of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
78) 13) dialog: (quickly interrupt- ing her) Don't say his name, you don't want his help.
79) 0) text: Juno peers into the model cemetery with interest.  A FLY BUZZES around her.  Juno blows it away.  Fly flees.
79) 1) dialog: No you don't!  He does not work well with others.
79) 3) text: A grave look comes over Juno's face as the light changes to suggest someone telling a ghost story around a campfire.
79) 4) dialog: I wasn't going to bring it up -- but rather than have you stumble into it and make another mistake, I'll tell you -- (she nervously puffs her cigarette) He was my assistant, but he was a troublemaker... He went out on his own as a free- lance bio-exorcist -- claims to get rid of the living... got into more trouble -- you remember the Chicago Fire...
79) 5) text: Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Juno continues.
79) 6) dialog: (continuing) He was demoted to a Grade-6 malevolent spirit.  He's been imprisoned on that plane ever since... in fact, I believe he's been sleezing around your cemetery lately.  He can only be brought back by saying his name three times.
79) 8) dialog: (continuing) But I strongly suggest that you remove the Deetz's yourself.
79) 9) text: She takes a final drag on the cigarette and smoke billows out the hole in her throat.  Juno starts to FADE.
79) 11) text: Juno fades.  Gone.  Barbara goes to the model, looks at the cemetery.
112) 2) text: She exits.  There are other special workers.  The place is really, really busy.  Adam and Barbara sit down to wait.  Juno storms through with a sheaf of papers.  She sees them.  She is steaming mad.
112) 3) dialog: The whorehouse was my idea.  I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
112) 5) dialog: You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be photographed.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
112) 7) dialog: (continuing tirade) Never trust the living!  We cannot have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
112) 11) dialog: (frustrated) I'm not your coach.  He survived.
112) 13) text: They start squabbling.  Juno has to wrangle them into another room.
112) 14) dialog: (frustrated) I'll be right back.
119) 0) text: Juno staring at them, hard.
119) 1) dialog: Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
119) 4) dialog: Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him. You need to worry about people like Otho.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- exorcism.
119) 6) dialog: (continuing) In plain English -- that's death for the dead.  I don't care what it takes, just get them out of there now.  It's not pretty, but -- that's death!
119) 8) dialog: (continuing) Wait a minute.  Let's see what you're going to do...
119) 9) text: They look at Juno.
119) 10) dialog: (continuing) ... to scare her.  I want to make sure it's not some silly parlor trick.
119) 14) dialog: Not bad.  Not bad.  Now you?  Go ahead.
119) 16) dialog: (continuing) Okay.  You look great!  Now go clean house.  And don't forget the photographs and the damned handbook.
119) 17) text: Barbara and Adam slowly stand and walk out the door. Barbara/Monster looks back pleadingly.  Football players flood into Juno's office.  One PARTICULARLY DUMB PLAYER has a revelation.  (He's pretty grisly, maybe sat too close to the engine.)
