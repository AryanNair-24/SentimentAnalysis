Some of the guests are affecting distaste for having had to make the long drive to Connecticut.  There's a bitchy feud going on between GRACE, the "Art In Amer- ica" writer, and BERNARD, Delia's agent, that threatens to become a full-scale war. Otho is drunkish and engaged in his third favorite occupation -- direct attacks on the personal weaknesses of his friends.  He's singled out his victim, BERYL, the editor for Ballantine, a frail-looking woman who is dressed "artistically."

103) 29) text: Bernard gathers Grace and Beryl and walks out the door.
103) 30) dialog: Delia, you are a flake.  You have always been a flake.  I'm packing up and going back to the tricks of the city.  That I can manage.  If you must frighten people, do it with your sculpture.
