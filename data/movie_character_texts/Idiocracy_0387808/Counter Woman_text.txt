24) 0) text: Joe walks through the waiting room.  People are sprawled  around with a variety of strange injuries -- a fat guy ta up trying to take off his sweatshirt who's violently  struggling to free himself, a whole family with their han all stuck in a big jar of food like it's a raccoon trap. Joe staggers up to what looks like a fast food counter. dull, bored-looking COUNTER WOMAN is behind the counter,  wearing a uniform that's halfway between Mcdonalds's and  hospital whites.
24) 3) dialog: Uuuh... We see the Counter Woman looking down at a machine that l like one of those cash registers at Mcdonalds where there are no words or numbers, just pictures, icons depicting  various ailments -- a picture of an elbow with pain lines coming out, a picture of a guy with a knife in his head m a frowny face, a guy's butt, a knee, etc. She glances up at Joe, back at the key pad, thinking hard
24) 4) dialog: Uhhhhh... Finally her finger lands on a key with an icon of a guy  shrugging, looking bewildered.  She presses it.
24) 6) dialog: Uh... go over there. Joe starts to leave then turns around.
