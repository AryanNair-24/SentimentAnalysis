70) 15) dialog: (stilted)
70) 16) text: Yeah... This is great! Rita rolls her eyes, pushes Joe out of the way and takes  charge, bouncing enthusiastically and improvising various filthy sounds. Joe backs away, impressed, turned on and a little scared. Outside, we hear the guards CHEER.

71) 1) dialog: Boy ah... Yeah, that sucks... Joe discreetly looks down at his pocket, sees the folded from Dizz.
71) 2) dialog: Hey ah, I need to go to the bathroom,  and, uh... Rita does too.  We'll  just go behind those bushes.  If  that's okay.

71) 7) dialog: Aw, Damnit! Way to go, Dizz... Joe throws it down in frustration.
71) 9) dialog: I don't think that's a good idea. We  can't take any chances. My face was  all over national TV. There's no way  I'm going back to that jail. Joe has a QUICK FLASHBACK, like a Vietnam flashback of th 400 pound guy sitting on the guy's face.
71) 10) dialog: Dammit!... Okay, we'll go back, I'll  get a better map. Next chance we  get, we'11 make a run for it.

71) 14) dialog: Yeah, that was a thousand years ago!   Just trust me. You're safe.
71) 17) dialog: Yes... And I know it's none of my  business, but when we get back, you  and Upgrayed should think about  couples counseling. And maybe you
71) 20) dialog: should get an art manager who's not  your boyfriend. Just then, the GUARDS come running through the bushes, in the ravine.

71) 28) dialog: What is this?
72) 0) text: Joe meets with the CABINET MEMBERS. He looks frustrated,  like this has been going on a while.
72) 1) dialog: Once again, I'm pretty sure all that  Rauncho stuff might be what's killing  the plants.
72) 5) dialog: It doesn't have to be from the toilet,  but yes, that's the idea.
72) 8) dialog: Look, your plants aren't growing. So  I'm pretty sure the Rauncho's not  working. Now I'm no botanist, but I  do know that if you put water on  plants they grow.
72) 10) dialog: Look, you want to solve this problem,  I want to get my pardon.  So why  don't we try it, and stop worrying  about what "plants crave."
72) 16) dialog: What are electrolytes?  Does anyone  even know?!

79) 7) dialog: Well, yes Mister President.  I think  I do.  It may take a while, but if  everyone is patient, I'm pretty sure  this will work.  The crops will start  growing, the dust storms will stop,  the economy'll get better.  You just  gotta be patient... So about my pardon- Camacho gives him big overly aggressive bear hug.
80) 0) text: Camacho addresses congress. Joe sits with Rita, Dizz and Cabinet Members out on the floor as before.

81) 1) dialog: Wow... If this works, I really did  save the country. I've never done  anything like that before. Beat.
81) 2) dialog: I hope something grows fast. I don't  want to wait too long for that pardon.
81) 5) dialog: Yeah. I'll get Dizz working on a  better map tomorrow. Joe goes over and sits in a chair.
81) 7) dialog: Yeah.  I know what you mean.
81) 10) dialog: Huh... I never thought of it that  way... (considers)
81) 11) text: Now I know why he built that bomb... Joe lies down on the floor.
81) 13) dialog: Oh, ah... that's okay. I wouldn't  want to get you in trouble with  Upgrayed - sleeping with some  stranger. Rita can't help herself, she starts laughing. Joe nervous joins in.
82) 0) text: Joe wakes up, goes over to the window and looks out at th rose garden. Nothing is growing yet.  The sprinklers are with water, but it still looks barren.  He looks a little worried.
82) 1) dialog: Shit.
83) 0) text: Joe's guards lead him to a conference room. He runs into  Dizz walking the opposite way with a chick on each arm.
83) 4) dialog: Oh, yeah... Hey Dizz, can I talk to  you a second? (to the guards)
83) 5) text: Excuse me a second. This is ah, top  secret, technical crop stuff. Joe pulls Dizz to the side, talks quietly.
83) 6) dialog: Dizz, you need to draw me a better  map.

84) 11) dialog: (trying to stay calm)
84) 14) dialog: Can't you shut the computer off?
84) 17) dialog: (reticent)
84) 21) dialog: Look, don't worry. Sometimes things  have to get worse before they get  better.
84) 23) dialog: (trying to play it  cool)
84) 24) text: Um... I have to go to the bathroom.   Joe casually steps out of the room.
85) 0) text: Joe runs in. Finds Rita.
85) 1) dialog: We gotta get out of here. Right now.
85) 4) dialog: I knew it! This is what happens when  I try to fix something. Camacho bursts in with Guards.
85) 6) dialog: Wait! I was just trying to help! (pleading)
85) 9) dialog: Judge? Oh no, not another trial.
88) 4) dialog: I don't even really understand what  I'm on trial for. I never said I was  the smartest guy on Earth, you people  did. I told you not to make me  secretary, but you did it anyway, so  I just tried to help. I told you it  was gonna take a long time for the  plants to grow, and it will work if  you give it a chance. I know it will.  Look, even if you find me guilty and  lock me away, for your own sake you  can't switch back to Rauncho.   Eventually, it will kill everything,  and you'll all starve. You gotta  believe me. That's all I gotta say.  Thank you.  Uh,  your extreme...  ness...es. Joe sits. The courtroom is quiet for a beat. It seems lik maybe Joe's words sunk in... Then some REALLY STUPID MUSIC kicks in. The PROSECUTOR ge up and starts dancing around.
90) 2) dialog: (to Dizz)
92) 0) text: Rita visits the condemned Joe. They are separated by thic glass. They speak quietly.
92) 2) dialog: No. They pretty much fixed that.
92) 5) dialog: Look Rita, this "Rehabilitation"  thing is basically a gladiator-style  death sentence. Only one guy out of  the last ten made it out alive.
92) 7) dialog: I don't think smart matters when a  guy's trying to run you over with a  giant truck... Look Rita, I want you  to go to the time machine without  me, don't wait.
92) 9) dialog: No, I'm sorry... It's my fault. We  should've made a run for it when we  had the chance.  Instead I had to  stay and screw everything up as usual.
92) 11) dialog: Yeah, well...
92) 13) dialog: Guess I better go...
92) 20) dialog: (momentarily detached)
92) 22) dialog: I get a car too right?

92) 29) text: Well, can't let 'em get me without a  fight. Bring it on assholes! He guns it, lurches forward and immediately stalls. The r dildo flops back and splats against the windshield, start Joe. He frantically restarts it just in time to maneuver car between the giant wheels of the Dildozer, which is so huge and jacked up, it roars right over him without even  touching him. Joe gains a little confidence. Allows himself a grin, unt he sees... WIDE SHOT, the Dildozer hydraulically drops itself down l a lowrider, until it's barely clearing the ground. The  Assblaster and Bitchmaker do the same.
92) 31) dialog: Oh shit...
94) 0) text: The Bitchmaker comes tearing at Joe, doing a wheelie. Joe just barely out-maneuvers him as a giant wheel comes cras down, missing Joe by an inch. Joe manages to outmaneuver the Assblaster, charging at Jo from the other direction, but then Joe's car stalls out a in the middle of the arena. The Assblaster and the Bitchmaker position themselves on  opposite sides of Joe, and get ready to smash him. Joe  frantically tries to restart his car.
94) 2) dialog: Come on... Come on... The two gigantic trucks come charging at Joe. Joe looks l a dead man. Then, at the last second Joe's engine turns o just enough to lurch the car forward, out of the way. The two trucks collide.  The Assblaster's jackhammer gets chewed up by the Bitchmaker's rotoblades, sending shrapne into the Bitchmaker's cockpit, KNOCKING OUT THE BITCHMAKE DRIVER.  Joe breathes a sigh of relief, until he gets ram by the Dildozer from behind, sending his car flipping and bouncing several times. The crowd goes nuts. Joe's car lands upside-down. It looks like it's all over. But then he sees that his steering wheel has broken off,  enabling him to leave the car. He climbs out, his left ha still cuffed to the broken-off steering wheel.  He takes running, narrowly escaping as the Dildozer pulverizes wha left of his car.. The crowd's loving it. The Assblaster backs up and stops. The crowd goes wild,  yelling some kind of one syllable chant that sounds vague like "dogs." Joe looks confused. Then a hatch falls open the back of the Assblaster, dumping a load of PIT BULLS t size of small horses on the arena floor.
97) 0) text: Joe does his best to keep the pit bulls at bay, running a swinging his steering wheel cuffed to his hand at them, a hiding behind the stalled Bitchmaker.
97) 19) text: Rope!  Rope! Rope! A rope is lowered from the ceiling Joe climbs it as best can with a steering wheel cuffed to his hand. He gets up, clear of the pit bulls reach, but looking up, quickly realizes there's nowhere to climb to but a flat  ceiling. It's only there as a cruel joke to prolong his  suffering.  Rita looks up at the Jumbotron, hoping.
99) 0) text: Joe holds on to the rope for dear life. Be strains to hol on, losing his grip. The Dildozer makes another pass at h Joe yells to the driver:
99) 2) dialog: That other driver called you a fag! The Dildozer peels out in anger, after the Assblaster. The Assblaster charges at Joe, doing a wheelie. The Dildo enters frame, slamming into the Assblaster and knocking h upsidedown. ON RITA, still being held back by security. She watches J looks up at the Jumbotron.

Joe barely pulls himself back up, but he no more strength. The Dildozer circles around, dramatically prolonging the  kill. The crowd starts chanting "Grease! Grease! Grease!"
101) 1) dialog: Oh no... ANGLE ON RITA, begging Camacho for more time.
101) 5) dialog: Shit. .. ANGLE ON RITA, watching the Jumbotron, fingers crossed.
103) 0) text: The Grease slips slowly down the rope to where Joe's hand are, making it too slick to hold on to. He starts to slow slide down. He falls off the rope, lands in the dirt. ANGLE ON RITA. She looks at the Jumbotron, losing all hop that Dizz will come through. ON THE DILDOZER: The Dildozer revs its engine a few times getting ready for the kill. ON Joe, staggers up, getting ready to run, or dodge the  Dildozer. ON RITA. She turns away, not wanting to watch Joe get kil As she looks down, we hear the cheers of the crowd sudden turn to CONFUSED MURMURS. Rita allows herself a peek.
104) 0) text: Joe, Rita, and Dizz are hanging out, having a little afte party, enjoying some FOOD -- each eating from their own  bucket, watching "Ow, My Balls" on TV.

104) 17) dialog: Starbucks? You're still gonna paint,  aren't you?
104) 19) dialog: Well, I guess this is goodbye then... Rita's sad to see him go, but she can't quite admit it. Joe, also sad, stands awkwardly, not sure what to say.

104) 48) dialog: Well... so what if it's complicated!  The country's depending on you! Come  on you guys!
104) 50) dialog: Look, you can't just keep giving up  so easily. You've gotta take command.  Make decisions! Think about things!   If you don't, who will? More blank, confused stares from the Cabinet members.
