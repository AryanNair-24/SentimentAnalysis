He pulls it out, looks around, then eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down. FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out hi moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on dreamily.
18) 1) dialog: Thank you, love. (to the Maidens)
18) 7) dialog: Now who'd like to polish my sword for me? The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands. HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in fr of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS an the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor. Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the Attendant quickly backs away. From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then severa HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapo on the table.
19) 7) dialog: 
19) 10) dialog: (to the others) My, we are hungry, aren't we? The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him.
19) 14) dialog: Name it, Lady Sif.
22) 10) dialog: Well, if he doesn't show up soon, he shouldn't bother. Odin looks like he's ready to feed him to his ravens.
27) 4) dialog: I've never been inside the Vault before. It's said the Tesseract was once held here.
28) 5) dialog: We thought that was just you being your normal cheery self. Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.
28) 28) dialog: What?!
28) 30) dialog: This isn't like a journey to Earth, where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god. This is Jotunheim.
28) 36) dialog: You did.
28) 54) dialog: And I.
29) 3) dialog: And he can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim.
29) 5) dialog: Please. Getting past him should be simple enough now, since he seems to be letting Frost Giants sneak by under his nose. Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.
31) 13) dialog: That was just a bit of a jest, really... Loki goes into damage control.
35) 7) dialog: You bathe? Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wond at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole plan is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breakin apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun city lies in the distance.
35) 10) dialog: Actually, it's not. We could turn right around, hop back to Asgard, share a mug by the fire. Could be nice. Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.
36) 2) dialog: Adventuring? Is that what we're doing?
36) 4) dialog: Freezing.
36) 14) dialog: If I have to listen to Volstagg's singing voice one more time, I'll fall on my own sword!
37) 36) dialog: I'm hoping that's just decorative. Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another F Giant. His comrades form another circle around him, separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoyi this.
37) 38) dialog: Well? What move, do you think?
37) 40) dialog: At this close range? I think "The Alfheim Lunge" is a better move.
37) 76) dialog: You really think your icicles are a match for Asgardian steel? Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade away.
37) 84) dialog: I may need a bit of help. Not a good look, is it?
37) 86) dialog: How's the face?
57) 0) text: Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell- shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before ROARING central fire. Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEA STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrad the stones begin to glow. He crushes them to a powder. Hi comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch. Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound. Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but sti blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant. Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back its normal color.
57) 3) dialog: At least he's only banished, not dead. Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.
57) 10) dialog: What?
57) 23) dialog: Why is it every time you choose to speak, it has to be something dark and ominous?
57) 30) dialog: Loki's always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely.
57) 38) dialog: And tell him what? "Oh, by the way, we think your son just betrayed the throne. And do us a favor. Bring back Thor. There's a good fellow!"
66) 10) dialog: Where is Odin?
66) 21) dialog: Of course. Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki stares after them.
129) 0) text: Volstagg eats ravenously from a PLATTER OF FOOD. Sif stan nearby, ill at ease. Fandral watches Volstagg incredulous as the large warrior stuffs himself. Finally Fandral can stand it no more.
129) 5) dialog: Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne, Asgard on the brink of war, yet you manage to consume four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef, and two casks of ale. Shame on you! Don't you care?! Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volst pulls his weapon, stopping him.
129) 10) dialog: It's treason, Hogun.
129) 13) dialog: Yes, yes, we know!
137) 11) dialog: Complicated fellow, isn't he?
139) 2) dialog: The winds would have blown them away by now. We should look for signs of a campfire.
139) 4) dialog: It's worth a look, I suppose. The party tromps towards the town.
146) 19) dialog: We're here to take you home. Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving.
150) 6) dialog: Or one of us, trying to protect you.
155) 2) dialog: What do you think? "The Svartalfheim Twist?" "Kiss of the Hag?" "Face Full of Boot?" Volstagg grins eagerly.
155) 4) dialog: Not "The Flying Mountain!" It threw out my back for a year last time!
156) 4) dialog: 
158) 12) dialog: No. We can still fight!
165) 3) dialog: Then I suppose we'd best start settling into our new lives. He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.
167) 6) dialog: Sorry, my love. These things happen.
185) 0) text: A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Thr sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting their battle with the Destroyer.
185) 6) dialog: Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a--
185) 8) dialog: Well, I was the one who had to drag your enormous carcass off the battlefield. That makes me the real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun? Hogun points to Volstagg.
185) 10) dialog: Well, how about that? A smile! I'd say that calls for another drink! They laugh and raise another round. Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying t sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches Frigga, bows her head.
