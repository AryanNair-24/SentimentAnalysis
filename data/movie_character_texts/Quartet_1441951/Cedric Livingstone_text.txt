LUCY COGAN, 30's, attractive, sits on the side, with ANNE LANGLEY. CEDRIC, seated on a throne-like chair, nods to BOBBY. All on BOBBY. He taps a pencil, raises it, nods to LETITIA. FELICITY, beside her, nervous, as she prepares to turn t pages. LETITIA plays the introduction to the Brindisi. BOBBY cue the chorus. No-one sings. Some RESIDENTS are amused, othe confused. BOBBY whispers to LETITIA. Watching, eyes narrowed, CEDRIC, not happy. BOBBY again cues the residents and they begin to sing. They give it their all. During this, FELICITY fumbles turning a page. LETITIA, irritated, nods repeatedly. FELICITY recovers. At the end, BOBBY finishes with a flourish, then turns to CEDRIC. All look at him expectantly. He keeps them waiting, then:
5) 1) dialog: Nowhere near to where you should be, Bobby. BOBBY nods, continues.
5) 2) dialog: (looks to WILF in the chorus ) Wilf, I couldn’t work out what you were doing, you were much too fast and we had awful ensemble problems there. Can we hear it from Bar 42? LETITIA and FELICITY, flustered, look for it in the score BOBBY alert, cues them.
5) 4) dialog: Silenzio. You never followed the conductor, did you? You always thought you were superior.

If we can’t make the gala into the hottest ticket in town, this house could collapse about our ears. We could lose it. None of us wants to be turfed out into the street with nowhere to go. (looks up, sees CISSY)
14) 3) dialog: You're late.
14) 5) dialog: (throws the paper down on the table) Close the door. Frank White has pulled out. He doesn’t feel up for the Gala.
14) 9) dialog: (tapping the table sharply) This is a disaster.
14) 11) dialog: Next item!

56) 9) dialog: (looks at others) Why not?
56) 12) dialog: (studies REGGIE) Well, it’s a shame. I can’t count the number of galas you have graced over the years with your incomparable voice, and I mean that sincerely. I don’t think you realize it Reggie, but people still talk about your ‘Celeste Aida’ four years ago. Your ‘Ave Maria’ two years ago. (REGGIE beginning to weaken) I know you don’t think much of me, Reggie, that’s fine, but for what it’s worth, when I heard you sing your ‘Nessun Dorma’ at the gala last year, all I thought was ‘Eat your heart out, Pavarotti!’ (REGGIE weakening more) With this one concert, we could raise enough money to get us through and attract much needed new benefactors. You would help save Beecham House, Reginald. (meaningfully) (MORE)
