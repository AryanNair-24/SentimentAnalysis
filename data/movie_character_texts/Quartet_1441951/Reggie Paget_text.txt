Some musicians carry their instruments - TONY ROSE, 70’s trumpet and DAVE TRUBECK, 70's pianist, DAPHNE MORGAN, 60's, harpist, LEO CASSEL, cellist, and CEDRIC. DR. LUCY COGAN, 30's, attractive, sits on the side, with ANNE LANGLEY. CEDRIC, seated on a throne-like chair, nods to BOBBY. All on BOBBY. He taps a pencil, raises it, nods to LETITIA. FELICITY, beside her, nervous, as she prepares to turn t pages. LETITIA plays the introduction to the Brindisi. BOBBY cue the chorus. No-one sings. Some RESIDENTS are amused, othe confused. BOBBY whispers to LETITIA. Watching, eyes narrowed, CEDRIC, not happy. BOBBY again cues the residents and they begin to sing. They give it their all. During this, FELICITY fumbles turning a page. LETITIA, irritated, nods repeatedly. FELICITY recovers. At the end, BOBBY finishes with a flourish, then turns to CEDRIC. All look at him expectantly. He keeps them waiting, then:

5) 15) dialog: Give or take a minute -
5) 22) dialog: I’ll set the alarm. As REGGIE sets his watch, OCTAVIA starts to sing. Her voi is remarkably strong but at one point, she forgets the words, and substitutes “Dee-dee-dee-dee.” She stops, embarrassed. The other singers remain respectful.
6) 4) dialog: (pulls back) You may be on stage the entire time, but you're not actually singing, you're just standing in the back. HARRY begins to argue back and REGGIE overrides him. REGGIE (CONT’D) (indicates people at his table) Why now, Harry? We’ve been sitting at this table for as long as I’ve been here. WILF has entered the dining room, supported by his cane, waving to others as he goes toward his table.
6) 26) dialog: (turns to CEDRIC) Cedric, it’s breakfast time. CEDRIC motions towards CISSY’s back. He rotates his finge indicating CISSY is unbalanced.

CISSY, seated next to REGGIE, listens to her CD while watching TWO LITTLE GIRLS (one of them is ESME) and a BOY playing on the grass. LETITIA, sitting on the other side of the terrace, with her DAUGHTER, chat while watching their kids. WILF approaches, goes to sit next to REGGIE and CISSY. REGGIE glances up and continues writing.

12) 22) dialog: (quietly) Yes. 20 WILF bends down to pick up the CD cover, but ends up sitting on the ground. He looks at the CD cover. REGGIE (CONT’D) (still reading and making notes) I’m glad they’ve reissued it. We might get royalties. WILF tries vainly to get up.
12) 26) dialog: (quietly) - fucking apricot jam, that’s what you had.
12) 28) dialog: Have you listened to it?
12) 30) dialog: No, no way, Wilf. No way.
12) 36) dialog: Why? Rap is not music.
17) 1) dialog: (lining up his next shot, turns to WILF) What about (names a part in an opera)? Just in time, REGGIE sees WILF’S foot move his own ball towards the hoop for an easier shot. REGGIE (CONT’D) (off-hand, not taking his eye off his ball) You just moved your ball.
17) 3) dialog: I saw you -—
17) 5) dialog: I clearly just saw you move it - WILF has been watching an attractive female visitor walki by with her husband.
17) 7) dialog: Precisely. Wilf, she’s married.
17) 9) dialog: (lining up his shot) We could always do “The Barber,” you, Cissy, and I, for the Gala. That would draw the crowds.
17) 11) dialog: (aiming) I always wanted to sing Wagner. Tristan. Just once. But it never came my way. Too many parts, too little time. (looks at WILF) Stand back. You’re obscuring my line.

17) 38) dialog: (furious) ...that’s why you kept it such a secret. You didn’t want me to know. It’s intolerable. I should have been consulted, Dr. Cogan. I should have been warned. 30
17) 40) dialog: She didn’t want? Always, always, always what she wants - nothing changes.
17) 42) dialog: She did know that I live here?
17) 44) dialog: She knew. (Beat) It's been so calm here. So agreeable. (DR. COGAN listens sympathetically as REGGIE rails on) Do you know what I wanted? I wanted a dignified senility. I scrimped and saved - repaired my own clothes, had only one glass of red wine a day. One! My only indulgence was to buy from time to time my favourite cologne. And why? So that I could afford without charity a decent room of my own in this house. And now she’s here. (moving toward the door) I shall have to find somewhere else to live.

32) 26) dialog: Anybody else?
32) 28) dialog: That’s opera! Originally people just like yourselves went to see Opera. But then the rich came along and made it something that it’s not. So what is it then? Someone said, ‘Opera is when a guy is stabbed in the back and while he’s bleeding, he sings.' (some school children laugh; ) Rap is when a guy gets stabbed in the back and while he’s bleeding, he talks - rhythmically and emotionally, but because rap is spoken the emotion is held in check. It’s on one note. (MORE)
32) 30) dialog: ‘Why should we listen to some old fart, giving us shit about his art.’ In Opera, however, we sing our feelings to the rise and fall of the music. The song sets our emotions free. OPERA
32) 33) dialog: Well, we have athletes here as well. Let me introduce you to the wonderful Octavia. She’1ll be joining us for this next part. (points to the rappers) You gentlemen, stand up, pick a note, sing it, and hold it for as long as you can and as loudly as you can. Octavia, will do the same. Ready? One..two..three..Go! The three school children and OCTAVIA sing their notes. T peter out at around ten seconds. OCTAVIA keeps going on a When she finally stops -
32) 35) dialog: What you’ve witnessed is the strength and athleticism of an Opera singer. The people who live here have the superhuman effort it takes to deliver the goods, to breathe, yes, to hold a note — (gestures to OCTAVIA) - like the one Octavia just sang - (distracted by the door opening a crack; irritated) Who is that? CISSY widens the door to include her and JEAN. Smiles.
32) 37) dialog: The heroines, sopranos - those are the ladies with the highest voices - they sing a repetitive theme that’s in all opera. Infidelity. Infidelity. Infidelity. As the Duke sings in Rigoletto - REGGIE looks again at the door. It’s empty. He stares at

38) 2) dialog: .--and in that way, we’re not the same. I’m not like you, Wilf. I positively liked getting old. Physical decay has seemed natural and inescapable. I think I can say I've welcomed the inevitable cheerfully. I’ve made the transition from opera star to old fart with aplomb (beat) Then Jean arrives...
38) 4) dialog: Of course she was. She was more ambitious than all of us.
38) 6) dialog: What can you know about it? 50
38) 8) dialog: Yes, and then you were married to the same woman for thirty thousand years. Call me old fashioned but did she know how often you were unfaithful to her?

43) 16) dialog: I liked your father. When he heard that you'd left me, he telephoned and said, ‘Sorry, old chap, but count your blessings. I'm still married to her mother.’ REGGIE moves towards the door. Brief pause.
43) 18) dialog: (close to the door) You've said it before. You're repeating yourself.
43) 20) dialog: Because that’s what people do. A brief silence.
43) 24) dialog: (at door, interrupting) Jean, I don't want to talk about it. I don’t want to re-live ancient history. You're here. I'm here. Trapped. That's all there is to it. Silence but for the distant music.

55) 5) dialog: ow.
55) 7) dialog: If I need to tire myself, I think about art. And if I need to exhaust myself, I think about life. But art - He suddenly breaks off, catching sight of someone through the trees. He turns vicious, hissing.
55) 9) dialog: Bitch! (JEAN is alarmed) See her? See her, there she goes, Angelique, see her? See her? (not shouting, but loud) Bitch, cow, sodding frog! oblivious, some distance off, wanders on through in and out of dappled light, towards the glade.
55) 10) dialog: She won't give me marmalade at breakfast. She gives me apricot jam.
55) 12) dialog: But Wilf loves it, she does it deliberately. (a little louder) Bitch! Cow! Skinny-arse French twat! (without pause turns back to JEAN as if nothing has interrupted him) Art is my chief preoccupation, Jean, its meaning, its significance, its ability to educate and enthrall, to inspire and civilise. REGGIE takes a book from his jacket pocket.
