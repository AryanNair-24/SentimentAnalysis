27) 6) dialog: (checks her profile in the mirror) I don’t feel it. I'm very slow. I'm on a waiting-list for a new hip.

43) 21) dialog: What I did was unforgiveable - but I was young and foolish. (he nods, moves closer to the door) Reggie, we have to come to some arrangement. (MORE)
43) 23) dialog: We can't keep avoiding each other or, worse, bickering like children every time we meet -
43) 25) dialog: What are we going to do? He broods for a moment. Then:
43) 27) dialog: How about trying the one that says ‘forgive and forget' - ? (REGGIE shakes his head; she again smells the handkerchief) The same cologne. The smell takes me back. (looks away) It takes me back to you, Reg - Though trying not to, REGGIE looks at her.

55) 1) dialog: ..-but I had no choice but to come here. I have very little - the truth is - (hesitates) I have - financial problems. All I have now are my clothes and jewelry. (nothing from REGGIE) - and I didn’t confide in anyone because I just didn’t want any fuss. Quite frankly, I was embarrassed. You know what the media are like. They were always beastly to me and if they learned I'd ended up here, they'd gloat.
55) 3) dialog: Oh, do piss off, Reggie, there’s a dear. As a matter of fact, and this will obviously surprise you more, I continue to cut a figure. The other night, I was Sir George's guest at Covent Garden. When I entered the box I received an ovation.
55) 6) dialog: (they walk, zings back) What do you do when you’re not giving your little “talks?”
55) 11) dialog: You hate apricot jam.

55) 15) dialog: “Works of art are of an infinite loneliness and nothing can reach them so little as criticism. Only love can grasp them and keep hold of them and be just to them.” She looks up at him. Pauses, and shares with him somethin quite private - 64
55) 16) dialog: It was after I had passed my peak - that the pressure became huge. And I was so aware of criticism and the importance of getting a good review...the next thing has to be as good or better and of course it can’t be, so in the end you get very nervous. They are closer than they have been since they met. Very close. Suddenly, they hear a noise. JEAN and REGGIE look around. Behind a hedge they see a startled ANGELIQUE and SIMON quickly gathering up a blanket. They both stand, SIMON holding the blanket under his arm. After a moment:
55) 18) dialog: (smiles) You weren’t asked.
57) 0) text: JEAN sits in fading light reading REGGIE’S book by Rilke. Suddenly, the door opens, CISSY darts in, puts the folded note on a table and disappears. Intrigued, JEAN rises, goes over to the door. She unfolds the note and reads. She is puzzled and suspicious.

61) 19) dialog: You’re both drunk. REGGIE nods yes.
61) 21) dialog: (as they are toasting) What quartet?
61) 23) dialog: What are you talking about?
61) 27) dialog: (stunned) What a damn fool idea.
61) 29) dialog: A great honour?
61) 31) dialog: No, I’m not legless. I haven’t agreed to anything. And don't talk about me as if I'm not here. (she looks at all of them) This is why you asked me to dinner.
61) 34) dialog: Let me ask you something? When did you last sing? This morning in the bath? In the shower? Has anyone heard you recently? Have you any idea of the noise you now make? Do you really want to be a laughing stock? Why didn’t you have the guts to just tell me what you wanted? How shameful of you to try to trick me. You’re pathetic. JEAN rises and walks out.

67) 1) dialog: Why didn’t you just come out with it - instead of this charade of taking me to dinner. Why didn’t you just say, you wanted us, average age hundred and ninety-eight, singing the quarter from Rigoletto? An honour? It’s not an honour? It’s not an honour, it’s insanity. What you did was disgusting. All of you! (turning on REGGIE) I’m going to say something very rude to you - Fuck you, fuck you Reginald Paget. JEAN turns and walks out. As CISSY, REGGIE and WILF try to adjust, aware of people in the dining room staring. One of them looks out the window and sees paramedics wheeling a gurney carrying OLLY, with DR. COGAN following. She has words with the paramedics and then turns. She walks towards the dining room and enters.

74) 8) dialog: (amazed) Frank White? May I see him?
74) 11) dialog: I had no idea you were here. I would have visited you. (lovingly) Dear, dear Frank. (sits beside the bed) How are you?
74) 13) dialog: Yes, what a fling, indeed. Short but giddy.
74) 15) dialog: I don't remember the hotel. I remember you rushing off and not seeing you for days on end.
74) 17) dialog: Never guessed what?
74) 19) dialog: The baritone? Of course I remember him. I had a fling with him, too.
74) 21) dialog: No! Did you, Frank?
74) 23) dialog: I don't know what came over me. I'm very ashamed but I'm so unhappy here and - Her voice trails off.

78) 0) text: JEAN is seated rather regally. WILF, REGGIE and CISSY are standing just inside the door, before her. They exchange silent looks.
78) 1) dialog: Please sit. CISSY looks for a chair, vainly, and then sits on the edg of the bed. WILF, seeing no chair, up-ends a low wastepap bin and sits on it as REGGIE goes around the bed and sits in the chair by the dresser. They sit.
78) 2) dialog: (gestures) Wilf, you can sit on the bed.
78) 4) dialog: (ignores his comment) First of all - again, I want to apologise to you, Cissy. What I did was appalling. And to you, Wilf.
78) 6) dialog: Please don’t make fun of me. And to you, Reggie.
78) 8) dialog: I have gifts for you. She picks them up hands one to CISSY, one to WILF and wal around the bed and gives the third to REGGIE. She returns to her regal chair and sits.
78) 9) dialog: Well. Open them. CISSY tears open her package. WILF hold his badly wrapped gift out by one or two fingers.
78) 11) dialog: I know you already have copies, but I've signed those. So that makes them rather valuable. WILF resists a comment.
78) 12) dialog: I also wrapped them myself.
78) 15) dialog: (confused) Yes. WILF rises awkwardly from his perch and moves to the door
78) 17) dialog: (rises) Thank you for coming. CISSY, rises, confused, takes out earphones attempts to untangle them.

78) 28) dialog: What you refuse to understand is that I’m a different person today.
78) 30) dialog: I simply can’t. (all eyes on her; barely audible) My gift deserted me.
78) 32) dialog: (looks at REGGIE) Yes. Shit happens.
78) 34) dialog: No. Her eyes fall on REGGIE’s. All smile.
78) 36) dialog: Oh Christ, Reggie. Are you telling me to go out and smell the roses?
78) 39) dialog: (suddenly alert) Anne Langley? Here at Beecham house? I thought they’d committed her.
78) 41) dialog: Oh please, Cissy, Violetta is supposed to be dying of tuberculosis. Anne Langley looked as if she was singing Falstaff and she sounded like a cat hang gliding.

We were to spend the night there and then go to Paris the next morning for our honeymoon. We had a champagne supper. Scrambled eggs, toast and lime marmalade. And then I blurted it out.
