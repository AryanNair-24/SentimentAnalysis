24) 28) dialog: What is that?     A fish crawl out of the river...? She moves to it... pushes aside the blanket, and freezes.
24) 29) dialog: God in heaven! IT IS THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN THE BABY. What we see is the prominent bald head of any newborn... but it has the face, the wrinkled skin, the faded eyes, of an octogenarian. Indeed, if we didn't know any better, it would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad-eyed old man...
24) 30) dialog: My Goodness, the Lord did something here...!

There's a myriad of old dark rooms... heavy furniture and carpets... an eclectic mixture of the possessions of those who have lived and died here over many years... and we see a parlor is crowded with Old People, from sixty to ninety-five, in various stages of health... various contraptions to keep them "afloat". An Old Age Home. We see Queenie moving quietly along a hallway, carrying the crying baby so as not to be seen. Tizzy, following her, still anxiously whispering after her...

41) 6) text: He presses on her stomach... making Queenie nearly fall over... held up by a "NURSE" in a crisp white uniform. And once she's regained her balance...

41) 29) text: Now walk, my old friend... Walk on...! And Benjamin, one crippled leg at a time, hobbles across the stage... The people urging him on... a string of "Hallelujahs...!" Queenie comes to join him... urging him...
41) 30) dialog: Let the Lord carry you... ... ...The Preacher, walking along with him, more a dance than a walk, shouting the name of the Lord... Queenie and The Preacher walking Benjamin across the stage... Benjamin making it to the other end... to a roar of "Amens"!

57) 16) text: And we can see Benjamin's heart beginning to break... he looks over, Tizzy, proudly smiling... And as Queenie accepts congratulations... Benjamin's old wrinkled face, watching her... looks like he's going to cry...
60) 27) text: You should be ashamed of yourself! And they're gone... Benjamin left sitting along under the sheets. There's a slight sound and he sees Queenie, in her nightgown, standing in the doorway...
60) 28) dialog: You are a different child... a man child. People aren't going to understand how different you are.
60) 31) dialog: God hasn't said yet. Now, back to bed and behave yourself. He crosses up the back stairs with the aid of his cane, and Mr. Oti, like a spectre, is sitting on one end of the back steps smoking a cigarette, drinking form his flask. He looks at Benjamin as he goes by.
