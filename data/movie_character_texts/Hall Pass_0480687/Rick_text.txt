72) 13) text: So where can we go to talk some more about this? RICK (NERVOUS)
72) 16) text: Where have you...? Why didn't you...? You knew this was my big night! How could you just--? (turns away, emotional) Look, can I please talk to you in private? Now. Leigh looks apologetically at Rick. LEIGH
72) 17) text: Can you give me a second? RICK
72) 18) text: Sure. Wannabe and Leigh walk a few feet away and Rick watches t have an ANIMATED CONVERSATION. It appears Wannabe may eve be crying. Finally, Wannabe storms across the room but wh he gets to the door, he looks back at Leigh. WANNABE
72) 19) text: Well? Are you coming? Leigh SIGHS, then approaches Rick. LEIGH
72) 20) text: I'm sorry, Rick. I have to go deal with this. Rick can't believe what's happening.    
72) 23) text: He's not...but he is a friend. Leigh glances at the broken-down Wannabe standing there a the door, then turns back to Rick. LEIGH (CONT'D)
72) 24) text: I'm sorry. Before Rick can stop her, Leigh LEAVES THE PARTY with Wannabe. After a LONG BEAT, Rick slides down into a chair DEVASTATED. CUT TO:

73) 1) text: .And he hasn't even spent one night in his own bed this week. RICK COLEMAN
73) 4) text: I called his assistant--he's been in the office almost everyday. RICK COLEMAN
73) 13) text: Oh My-lanta. RICK COLEMAN
73) 14) text: And to wash it all down... Rick reaches into the bag and pulls out a DESSERT WINE. O Maggie's smile, we CUT TO:
74) 0) text: A glum Rick is walking through the PACKED PARTY when he b into Baker and Hog-Head standing around a keg with a GROU GUYS. RICK
74) 2) text: We're here for the hall pass. RICK
74) 4) text: We did. We're here with them. He nods toward RICK LEARY and WILLY BOSHANE, both early 4 and paunchy. RICK
74) 7) text: When Leary and Boshane heard about your guy's hall pass, they convinced their wives to give them one, too. A smiling Leary tries to HIGH-FIVE Rick, but he's having of it. He turns to Baker, livid. RICK
74) 9) text: They didn't say anything. Our wives heard about it at the pool. RICK
74) 10) text: No! At the pool?! Rick rubs his face, distressed. BOSHANE
74) 11) text: Yep. And then about three days ago-- after some hard-core negotiating-- we managed to push the bill through. The guys LAUGH. Rick can hardly believe what he's spawned RICK
74) 16) text: That's right. It's about going bowling and, uh, staying up late, and being able to do what you want to do when you want to do it. RICK
74) 21) text: To freedom! The guys TAP their beer cups, then EXIT toward the back d A dejected and defeated Rick watches them go, then turns pushes his way through the crowd to the front door. As he OPENS THE DOOR to leave, he finds himself FACE-TO-FACE WI LEIGH. LEIGH
74) 22) text: Hey, where are you going? RICK
74) 24) text: No. I told you, I just had to talk him off the ledge. I calmed him down and sent him on his way. RICK

75) 1) text: I'll be right back--I just have to use the bathroom. Rick nods, then watches as Leigh walks off and disappears into the bathroom. He takes a DEEP BREATH. This is it. Just then he hears O.S. LAUGHTER. Rick heads down the hallway and pushes open a door.
75) 5) text: All partied out, pal. Rick nods, understanding. Coakley LAUGHS once again at th TV. COAKLEY (CONT'D)
75) 6) text: Man, that Barney Fife still kills me. He looks back to Rick. COAKLEY (CONT'D)
75) 7) text: Hey, I was thinking about this hall- pass business. It's really ironic, isn't it? Rick glances down the hall to see if Leigh has returned. RICK
75) 9) text: Well think about it. There's two kinds of guys who cheat on their wives: The guy who does it behind her back, and a guy like you who has his wife's permission. RICK
75) 11) text: Yeah, whatever. The point is, if you asked a hundred people who the better CJuy is, ninety-nine of 'em would pick you, because you're being honest--there's no deceit involved. Rick is growing uncomfortable. COAKLEY (CONT'D)
75) 12) text: But the funny thing is, the other guy, the cheater, the bad guy, he has to live with all that guilt and anxiety, while his wife's running around happy as a clam because she doesn't know anything. And you, the good guy, you've got no guilt at all because you just laid it all on your wife's shoulders. RICK
75) 15) text: It's like she's your guilt Sherpa! Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick deflates. COAKLEY (CONT'D)
75) 16) text: Funny, huh? RICK (WEAKLY)

75) 21) text: Rick, I hope you don't mind me tracking you down--Paige told me where you were staying. FRED
75) 27) text: I know she tried to hook-up with you--twice in fact--and that you set her straight both times. Fred hadn't heard this from Rick and is a little confused    
75) 30) text: Rick, enough with the chivalry. Paige wanted to sleep with you and you didn't take advantage of her. I'm just saying that's very cool. He shrugs modestly. FRED
76) 0) text: Rick ENTERS to find Leigh playing a pinball machine. Leig turns and smiles at Rick. RICK
76) 2) text: What? RICK (NERVOUS)
76) 5) text: Really? Are you feeling okay? You're not mad because I went outside with my friend, are you? RICK
76) 6) text: No, no, no. Look, I shouldn't be doing this. I have.. .you know, commitments. Leigh nods at this, then unties a shoulder strap and her DRESS FALLS TO THE FLOOR. Suddenly she's NAKED before him and she's PERFECT. RICK (CONT'D) (WEAKLY)
76) 7) text: Um, you dropped something. For a moment nobody moves. We can almost hear Rick's hear beat. Then Leigh STEPS CLOSER to him and Rick instinctive leans back. LEIGH
76) 8) text: Relax. Don't think so much. You're gonna have your wife for the rest of your life, but tonight. . .you have me. Leigh smiles. And it's the kind of smile you only get two three times in your life, if you're lucky, and probably n from a woman this beautiful. She reaches down and UNBUCKLES HIS PANTS, then she PULLS HIS SHIRT. They stand face-to-face now, the middle-aged g and the young beauty, and it's happening exactly the way had hoped it would, the dream. She presses her body against his and STARTS TO KISS HIS N her hand DISAPPEARING SOMEWHERE BELOW HIS WAIST. Then she leans her head AGAINST HIS CHEST. As he looks down at her we PUSH IN on a suddenly conflicted Rick. RICK
76) 10) text: What are you doing? RICK
76) 14) text: Yes, she did, but... look, you're insanely beautiful and pathologically sexy and every cell in my body is telling me to dust do this, but-- Rick points to his chest. RICK (CONT'D)
76) 17) text: So I'm sorry, Leigh, but as amazing as I think you are...I gotta go home. Rick shrugs apologetically. LEIGH
76) 18) text: Well, I think you have a screw loose and you're probably going to regret this for the rest of your life, but. . .right on, man. RICK
76) 20) text: No. It's only one-thirty--I'm going back down to the party. Rick raises two fingers. RICK

77) 12) text: Oh yes! Rick... please...I want you to make love to me. Just then Rick BURSTS INTO THE ROOM, out of breath. Fred Meg come up from under the covers. (Fred is at waist-leve her.) RICK
77) 15) text: Fred? I thought you were Rick?! RICK
77) 16) text: I'm Rick. Fred cowers guiltily. FRED
78) 1) text: What did they tell you? Is Grace gonna be okay? RICK
78) 6) text: You moron, that's Lny car! His is the one next to it! Wannabe looks over at Rick's Avalon, PULLS OUT A KNIFE, a quickly SLASHES TWO OF RICK'S TIRES. As Rick and Fred RUN TOWARD HIM, Wannabe JUMPS INTO AN OLD BRONCO and PEELS OU THE PARKING LOT. BACK ON Rick and Fred as they slow down and CATCH THEIR BREATHS.

81) 14) text: Oh my God... RICK COLEMAN
84) 1) text: I'm sorry, man, I shouldn't have blamed you for this. I'm the one who dragged you into this thing. RICK
84) 3) text: I've been bad, Rick. I've been real bad. RICK

84) 7) text: On the vagina. RICK
84) 8) text: Ooh. They hear a SIREN and Rick looks back to see the cops on their tail. RICK (CONT'D)
