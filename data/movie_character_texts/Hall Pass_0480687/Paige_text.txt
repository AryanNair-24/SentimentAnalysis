7) 2) dialog: Perfect. That Gunnar is so cute-- all he wants to do is wrestle with me. Rick smiles at this.
7) 3) dialog: Mr. Mills, would it be okay to turn down the air--I'm a little chilly. Look--I got goose bumps. As she HOLDS OUT HER ARM to show him the GOOSE-BUMPS, we RACK FOCUS BEYOND HER ARM to the ERECT NIPPLES that are PIERCING THROUGH HER SHEER TOP like small tents.

9) 18) dialog: Besides, it's so arbitrary. How does it make sense that twenty's old enough to fight in Iraq or watch a porno movie, but it's too young to drink a beer? Rick shifts in his seat.
9) 20) dialog: Fight in Iraq?
9) 22) dialog: Watch Porn? Oh, God yeah--half the girls in those things are my age. Rick catches a hint of cleavage, a flash of leg.
9) 23) dialog: Look, I promise no one's gonna find out. If you want, you can join me down at the lake--we'll listen to some tunes and have a couple beers. Rick stares at her, pictures it in his head. She looks hopeful, open.

64) 32) text: Oh, don't worry about it. It was a big misunderstanding. PAIGE
64) 35) text: If you thought I was coming on to you that night, it's because...I was. Rick flinches at this. Just then the Bartender returns wi the champagne. Rick fumbles through his pocket and finall pays. Then he's left alone with Paige and her coed-in-lov with-the-professor eyes and her suddenly heaving cleavage RICK
