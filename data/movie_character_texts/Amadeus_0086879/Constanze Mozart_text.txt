He is age twenty-six, wearing a  fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the  Archbishop of Salzburg upon it. He is puzzled; Constanze disappeared. Baffled, he turns and is about to leave the room, when  Constanze suddenly squeaks from under the cloth like a ti mouse. Instantly Mozart drops to all fours and starts cra across the floor, meowing and hissing like a naughty cat.

Five couples (the group we have just seen) are dan in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs. When the mus stops they will each have to find a chair, and the one wh fails must pay a forfeit. Constanze is dancing with Leopold; Mozart is dancing with one of the actresses; the two other actresses are dancing with two other gentlemen; and two children dance together a little boy and a little girl. The scene is watched by a circle of bystanders; among them - from the doorway - is  Salieri. Schikaneder stops playing. Immediately the couples scramb for the chairs. Leopold and Constanze meet on the same ch bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession it. To the amusement of the people around, the chair over balances and they both end up on the floor. Constanze  immediately gets up again, sets the chair on its feet, an tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time. But  Schikaneder calls out from the forte-piano.

Leopold angrily takes off Constanze's wig and leav the circle; his partner, Constanze, is left alone. Seeing this, Mozart leaves his partner and catches his father  entreatingly by the arm.
85) 13) text: He takes off his own wig and puts it on Leopold's uncover head. The effect, if not as ridiculous, is still somewhat bizarre, since Wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs. He takes Constanze's wig from his father. As this happens, t music stops again. Mozart gently pushes his father down o a nearby chair; the others scramble for the other chairs; and he is left as the Odd Man Out. He giggles. Schikanede calls out to Leopold from the keyboard.

Attracted by this astonishing feat, the players draw near to the instrument. So does Salieri, cautiously, with some the bystanders. Constanze watches him approach. Only Leop sits by himself, sulking. The fugue ends amidst terrific clapping. The guests call to Mozart.

Then he begins to play the tune to which they dance in the most obvious way imaginable, relying heavily on a  totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and  dominant, endlessly repeated. The music is the very essen of banality. The bystanders rock with laughter. Mozart st to giggle wildly. Through this excruciating scene, Salier stares at Constanze, who suddenly turns her head and look challengingly back at him. Mozart's parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding fart noise instead of notes to end cadences. He builds th up, urged on in his clowning by everyone else, until sudd he stops and cries out. The laughter cuts off. Mozart sta up, clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his  breeches. The momentary hush of alarm is followed by a ho of laughter. CU, Salieri staring in pain.
