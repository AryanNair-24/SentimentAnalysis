BONNIE closes the door and immediately begins fussing wit CLYDE's hair, doing a scathing imitation of BLANCHE.  Tho her miming expresses her irritation at being closeted wit the Barrow menage, it is also a peach doing an imitation a lemon--and it is disarmingly sensual... Indeed the mimi allows BONNIE to be physically freer with CLYDE, and allo CLYDE to respond without anxiety, without self-consciousn We should have the distinct--if momentary--feeling that CLYDE could suddenly make it with BONNIE.
