As the camera slowly pulls back from the closeup we see that we have been looking into a mirror.  She is standing before full-length mirror in her bedroom doing her make-up.  She overdoes it in the style of the time: rosebud mouth and s forth.  As the film progresses her make-up will be refine until, at the end, there is none. The camera pulls back and continues to move very slowly throughout the first part of this scene.  As the camera continues to move away, we see, by degrees, that BONNIE i naked.  Her nudity is never blatantly revealed to the audience, but implied.  That is, she should be "covered" various ways from the camera's P.O.V., but the audience m be aware of her exposure to CLYDE later in the scene.  Th is the only time in the film that she will ever be this exposed, in all senses of the word, to the audience.  Her attitude and appraisal of herself here are touched with narcissism. The bedroom itself is a second-story bedroom in a lower- class frame house in West Dallas, Texas.  The neighborhoo is low income.  Though the room reveals its shabby surroundings, it also reveals an attempt by BONNIE to fix up.  Small and corny objets d'art are all over the tops o the bureaus, vanity tables, etc. (Little glass figurines porcelain statuettes and the like.) BONNIE finishes admiring herself.  She walks from the mir and moves slowly across the room, the camera moving with her, until she reaches the screened window on the opposit wall.  The shade is up.  There are no curtains.  She look out the window, looking down, and the camera looks down w her. EXT. BEDROOM.  BONNIE'S P.O.V.  DAY. Over her shoulder, we see the driveway leading to the gar connected to the house.  There is an old car parked in th driveway, its windows open.  We see a man walking up the driveway, somewhat furtively.  He is a rather dapper fell dressed in a dark suit with a vest, a white collar, and a straw boater.  It is CLYDE BARROW.  Obviously, he is abou to steal the car.  He looks it over, checking around him make sure no passers-by are coming.  He peers inside the front window to see if the keys are in the ignition.  He studies the dashboard.  BONNIE continues watching, silent Finally she calls out.

We remain outside with BONNIE watching.  For a minute nothing happens.  We can barely see what is going on in the store.  Then CLYDE com out, walking slowly.  In one hand he holds the gun, in th other a fistful of money.  He gets halfway, to BONNIE and smiles broadly at her, a smile of charm and personality. She smiles back.  The moment is intense, as if a spark ha jumped from one to the other.  Their relationship, which began the minute BONNIE spotted him in the driveway, has really begun.  CLYDE has shown his stuff and BONNIE is "turned on." Suddenly the old man who runs the grocery store comes running out into the street, completely dumbfounded.  He stands there and says nothing, yet his mouth moves in sil protest.  CLYDE points the gun above him and fires.  It i the first loud noise in the film thus far and it should b shock.  The old man, terrified, runs back into the store fast as he can, CLYDE quickly grabs BONNIE's hand.  The camera swings with them as they turn and begin to run dow the street.

Despite the fact that he may have encountered th situation many times before, it's one that no twenty-one- year-old boy in 1932 is sophisticated enough to dismiss easily with bravado. BONNIE remains seated in the car.  She seems terribly vulnerable.  She fumbles about for a cigarette, too confu to figure out what didn't happen.

They call them cold-hearted killers; They say they are heartless and mean; But I say this with pride, That I once knew Clyde When he was honest and upright and clean. But the laws fooled around, Kept taking him down And locking him in a cell, Till he said to me, "I'll never be free So I'll meet a few of them in hell."
