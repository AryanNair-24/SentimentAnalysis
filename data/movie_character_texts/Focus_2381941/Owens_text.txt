Members of RACING TEAM GARRIGA diligently wo their various jobs as their driver gets a feel for the tr IN THE STANDS sits Spanish team owner RAFAEL LAMARCA GARC GARRIGA-- 40, wildly wealthy and even more powerful. It o out of every pore. He sits alone, sipping on an espresso and surveying his t from on high. GARRIGA POV: Through the bustle trackside we find NICKY talking to a rather severe and ominous 60 year old WELSHM Garriga’s head of security, WILLIAM OWENS. They huddle around a bank of monitoring equipment and Nic points out the readings on several LCD screens. 66. Owens offers no emotion as he listens. Eventually, he ste away-- headed for the stands. Garriga takes another sip of his espresso, never taking h eyes off the track until--
40) 2) dialog: The tech says his gizmo checks out. But in complete candor I don’t like this-- and I don’t like this boy.
40) 4) dialog: He’s a con man, sir.
40) 6) dialog: I've dealt with guys like him when I was at 85 Albert. Slippery fish.
40) 8) dialog: That I will. My eyes are open and I keep my 1911 well fed. Garriga is amused.
41) 0) text: Before the huge windows in the empty dining area overlook the track, Garriga, Owens and Nicky have lunch. 67.
41) 11) dialog: This needs to be discreet. It needs to be safe. No holes.
41) 16) dialog: Just because the techs say it checks out, what makes you think you can convince them you're absolutely real? That you’re completely authentic? You can’t be dicking around boy. 69.

47) 1) dialog: Are you drunk?
47) 3) dialog: What part of the plan calls for a tray full of Lemon Drops, Apple- tinis, and Goldschlager shots? Are you pledging a sorority house?
47) 5) dialog: Why? What’s going on? Something wrong?
47) 7) dialog: You're not feeling it? This isn’t Jazzfest, Thelonious. What’s your reason?
47) 9) dialog: You sure? Mr. Garriga is not a guy you want to cross... me neither. So if there’s something you need to say, say it.
47) 11) dialog: God damned primadonna delicate science bullshit. You’re not smashing atoms here. This isn’t CERN. Just do what you’re being paid to do. (mutters ) Shitheel... Owens exits. Nicky shoots back another drink.

64) 27) dialog: Sarcasm. Another pillar of your generation. You want to tell somebody to fuck off, tell ‘em to fuck off. Don’t say, ‘gee, what a great jacket.’ It’s weakness. Nicky rolls his eyes as Owens glances through to the bed.
64) 28) dialog: That’s a messy bed.
64) 30) dialog: Someone here?

64) 33) dialog: All of you with your phones and computers that bring nothing but a barrage of useless information.

64) 38) dialog: Who'd you pick up at the airport? ON JESS, on the other side of the dividing wall. She catc sight of the trap Owens laid- she can’t go through the bedroom again. 107. Nicky arrives at the door first, glancing back at the liv area and CATCHES A GLIMPSE of Jess SLIPPING ONTO THE BALC
64) 40) dialog: I got people there.
64) 42) dialog: Why? Is there a problem?
64) 44) dialog: I got a little red hair on my taint that tickles when something's afoot. Lately I’ve been scratching my nethers like a fucking Macaque. He wanders toward the balcony. Nicky follows.

81) 115) dialog: 
81) 117) dialog: What the fuck! He backhands her in a rage-- swatting her away. He pulls the pen and grumbles through gritted teeth.
81) 118) dialog: Do you want him to fucking die?! Jess is flummoxed by his words-- WHICH ARE SUDDENLY SPOKE AN AMERICAN ACCENT. His Welsh accent is GONE.
81) 119) dialog: Don’t you know anything? Owens rummages through the tools on the ground-- finding OIL INJECTOR (basically a large SYRINGE) and turning his attention to Nicky’s wound--
81) 120) dialog: What kind of piker are you? You never heard of a Toledo Panic Button? Didn’t he tell you I was inside? Jess is absolutely speechless. She can only shake her hea 126.

81) 122) dialog: You shoot between the third and fourth rib. About eleven O’clock of the left nipple. It misses the heart, all the major arteries. Just punctures the lung. Works most of the time. Well, fifty five percent of the time. Probabilistic. He flips Nicky on his back and tapes shut the entry wound
81) 123) dialog: Untreated, you’ve got ten minutes tops before he drowns in his own blood. He STICKS the blunt injector needle through the tape and DRAWS BACK the PLUNGER. It fills with BLOOD.

81) 128) dialog: Keep an eye on that. Pull the plunger if he can’t breathe. She scrambles to Nicky, scooping him into her arms. He’s no means in good shape, but he’s alive.
81) 132) dialog: (to Nicky) Language boy- I just saved your life!
81) 134) dialog: And have the whole world rain down on my head? This was your mess! You pay for it. Three years I was on the inside! For what? So you could blow it to make cow eyes with some race skank?
81) 136) dialog: I brought you in. You said you could handle it. I should have known with all your talk of regret and ennui that you were gimped. Live and learn I say. He extends a hand to Jess with a big smile. 128.

81) 139) dialog: I like you. You can take a punch.

82) 0) text: Owens drives as Jess tends to Nicky in the back seat.
82) 1) dialog: I’ve been working for this prick Spaniard for three years. He’s got a guy at McEwen and he doesn’t tell me? What the hell happened to trust? (self-scolding) Should have seen it. Sloppy. You can be many things in this game but sloppy ain’t one of them. Time to get out.
82) 3) dialog: Beaut wasn’t it? (then) You know what the hard part was? The hard part wasn’t getting him to hire a con man. (MORE )
82) 5) dialog: No, no- the hard part was getting him to think it was his idea to hire a con man. Ah, fuck it-- the hard part was not laughing. Too rich. (then) You can’t con an honest man. Ever heard that? They gotta have larceny in their heart. Isn’t that right Nicholas? Nicky, bleary, nods.
82) 6) dialog: Larceny in their heart. This guy’s heart was black with the stuff. Low hanging fruit. He pulls over, parking across the street from a HOSPITAL. glances in the mirror at Jess and Nicky, happy together.
82) 7) dialog: This life is no place for lovebirds. There’s no happiness here with that. Just think about this honey-- you tricked my boy. That’s no small feat. But the con you pulled wasn’t for money. It was for love. Now you got me choked up. But this game is about the money and if you’re not into that you need to move to the land of the regular people. Where trust isn’t a tool to get you rich or get you laid... it’s where trust is everything. (beat) It’s all you got and all you’1ll ever have. And like it or not, that’s who you are now. Both of you. Another glance in rear view. They seem okay with his assessment. It softens him a touch.
