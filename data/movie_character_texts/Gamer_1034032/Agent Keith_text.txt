The door clicks open and SEVERAL MEN enter. One SITS. We see them from behind, not their faces; SIMON nods waddup. The SEATED MAN pushes several PHOTOS across the table to SIMON. SIMON glances at the top photo as casually as he c manage - it shows SIMON in an MTV TRL-type setting, being interviewed in front of a live audience of teenage girls.
