KABLE jerks against his restraints, every inch of him wanting to RIP THE MOTHERFUCKER APART.. He uses his elbow to help her back up, but SANDRA fights through it, sits back up and spits blood - she can handle herself. The CAMERA holds TIGHT on KABLE and SANDRA... KABLE lets glob of blood dangle from his mouth, biting his lip, bear it... we hear the CRUNCHING SOUND of the CLUB working on others... and the METALLIC RUMBLE and CLATTER of the TRAI growing louder, POUNDING, slamming into our brains, blott out all thought... until...
5) 0) text: KABLE steps out.    The LEDS on his weapon blink off in sequence... ARMED GUARDS are EVERYWHERE, rounding up the I-Con's. [I-CONs (I-Convicts) are the combatants -- death row inmates/lifers, of which there are never a shortage. GENERI-CON's (Generic Convicts) are the street traffic th lend unpredictability and realism to the battlefield... t are computer controlled NPCs (non player characters)... p thiefs and criminals who are risking their lives by participating to commute their sentences] A DOZEN GUARDS collect weapons - TWO approach KABLE.

The GUA wears a black gas mask, shattered and pouring blood. Othe prisoners, shackled together, stand by watching, forming half circle around the fight. They are shirtless, covered the same white powder - they look like tribesmen. One of the prisoners, very distinctive, nods grimly, clea enjoying the show. DISTINCTIVE PRISONER                            *
23) 21) text: He peers through the little window at the top of the door but she's GONE... Instead, a group of PRISONERS are being led down the corr to their NEW CELLS. We recognize grim, battered faces fro the yard - these are the men that stood by as the GUARD w being beaten down.

51) 0) text: KABLE and the GUARD are ANT-SIZED in what looks like a massive driving range. VIRTUAL TARGETS are holographicall projected in mid-air at various heights and distances. Ot PRISONERS are there too, a ways off; well out of earshot. KABLE looks over a Swarmer cartridge, slams it into his weapon; switches turrets, takes a bead on a VIRTUAL TARGE We see him intentionally PAN THE SIGHT OFF to the left of target; he pulls the trigger - CLICK. The TARGET - and several others close by - turns RED, BLINKS - a HIT. This thing doesn't just take out individuals; it takes out VICINITIES.
