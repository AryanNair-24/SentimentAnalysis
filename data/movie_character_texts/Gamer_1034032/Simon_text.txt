42) 0) text: SIMON'S ROOM is simple - FOUR WALLS and a CEILING, each o 3-D, corner-to-corner VIDEO SCREEN. The HD level of the screens is virtually ABSOLUTE - the flesh and blood SIMON himself is just another element in a HIGH-DOLLAR/HIGH-TEC SPACE. The FLOOR is ALL BED. SIMON PADS IN, takes a spinning STU JUMP and ROLLS onto his back in a big ass pile of pillows sandwich intact. The SCREENS are a jumble of floating frames, competing fo prominence in the 3-D space... muted VID CHATS, STOCK TICKERS, SPORTS SCORES, ultraviolent SLAYERS playback, et Everything dynamic, everything moving. One whole wall is apparently a REAL TIME monitor of the SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND, with updated statistics... POINTS LEADER, FRAG COUNT - we notice that KABLE leads these categories; a video loop of KABLE in action beside his na illustrates the point. In the FOREFRONT of SIMON'S attention: KABLE EARNS 800 UPGRADE POINTS
42) 1) text: A set of dynamic frames allow him to scroll through a ser of revolving images - WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT, BODY ARMOR. SIMON interacts with the 3-D environment using HAND GESTU he can SLIDE, SQUEEZE, PULL AND SCROLL the images just by moving his fingers in the air. He flips past various TRANSFORMERS-looking SUPER GUNS...
42) 6) dialog: Gay... gay... gay... super gay... hm.
42) 10) dialog: Daddy like...
42) 13) dialog: Fan-girl, stop hacking. If I want you unmuted I'll unmute you.
42) 15) dialog: Uh huh.
42) 19) text: SIMON casually waves his hand at the frame, like flicking a fly; ANNOYING GIRL is wiped away, bringing CUTE STONED to the forefront.
42) 23) text: Thanks baby. When can I meet you for like reals? SIMON notices a metallic sparkle from the GIRL'S TONGUE. SIMON
42) 25) text: Aaaa. He reaches out and "pinches" the screen, ZOOMING IN close she sticks out her tongue - it fills the wall... a dozen wicked looking BLACK TONGUE RINGS stud the wet pink flesh TEN FEET HIGH. SIMON (cont'd)
42) 29) dialog: Hey sissy. This is SIMON'S SISTER, SHELLY, 14.       Frosted up lips and hair like a Tokyo hooker. SHELLY
42) 30) text: Mom says - let me see, go to college, move the fuck out, and... oh yeah, you're a sick retard, you're pathetic, and you smell like Jeffrey Dahmer. SIMON
42) 37) dialog: Maybe. TWINS (star struck)
42) 38) text: Oh my god, it's really you!!! Suddenly all of SIMON's screens are filled with the TWINS
42) 39) dialog: Nice. TWINS (in unison)
42) 40) text: Do you wanna see our tits, Simon? SIMON (shrugs)
42) 42) text: Mmmmm, now that we have your attention, here's another offer you can't refuse. SIMON
42) 44) text: Fifty million euros for control of Kable, instant transfer to the account of your choice. SIMON
42) 46) text: Baby... make it a hundred. SIMON
42) 54) text: What the fuh...? ... waits a beat... and SHOOTS THE OTHER MAN IN THE HEAD. Black blood pools. This is REAL. The loop repeats. When the SHOOTER turns his face toward the camera, SIMON freezes the frame with a gesture and ZOOMS IN. It's KABLE. A MESSAGE is typed across the screen one letter at a time we may recognize the retro chicago font from the HUMANZ v prank earlier: want to talk to him?
42) 55) text: Then, blinking, lo-fi in the lower right corner of the wa WALKIETALKIE.exe SIMON (cont'd)
48) 0) text: We get our first wider view of the room. Much more crampe than SIMON'S ROOM... like SIMON'S, the room is dominated GIANT VIDEO SCREEN, but just the front wall... there are other - smaller, paper thin - screens mounted in various spots and leaning against walls; GARBAGE and TECH GEAR al over the floor. GORGE - late 30s, MORBIDLY OBESE - is contained by a mass automated rolling chair, like the Escalade of Rascals. The HUMANZ message has taken over his screen and he's GOI FUCKING BALLISTIC, throwing shit at it and gesturing craz to the wall-mounted MOTION SENSORS with his hands, trying get the image back. It's NOT HAPPENING.
54) 3) dialog: Simon. (beat)
55) 0) text: We are in the OVER-THE-SHOULDER POV of the FLY CAM as KAB breaks daylight and slides down the hillside... superimpo over the IMAGE: SIMON'S REFLECTED FACE... the CAMERA pans centers and FOCUSES IN on the REFLECTION... SNIPER BULLETS whistle by; KABLE DUCKS, ROLLS... the CAME PULLS BACK... OUT OF THE SCREEN...
56) 0) text: ... past the flesh and blood SIMON into an OVER-THE-SHOUL SIMON controlling KABLE, PLAYING HIM - as... KABLE LANDS in the ROCKSTAR POSE. SIMON mirrors him in fr of the GIANT SCREEN - whatever SIMON does, KABLE echoes.

57) 8) dialog: I know.
58) 0) text: SIMON POP-LOCKS - the breakdance arm wave.
58) 1) dialog: It's cool, yeah?
59) 2) text: They spot another BROWN advancing toward a group of BUILDINGS; SIMON moves KABLE to join him. Just as KABLE g there a BLUE KICKS OUT A DOOR and opens up with an ASSAUL SHOTGUN, shredding the BROWN. Two more BLUES POP OUT of a DITCH on the OPPOSITE SIDE, TRIANGULATING. KABLE ROLLS - BIG AMMO displacing the air just inches abo his head and BLOWING OUT the windows/tires of an ABANDONE CAR behind him - switches TURRETS and comes up FIRING... armor-piercing shells: BOOM. BOOM. A 180 spin... BOOM.      MINUS three BLUES.
60) 0) text: In QUICK CUTS we see SIMON striking BADASS poses; on the screen KABLE ECHOES THEM - it's like a SYNCHRONIZED DANCE
61) 6) dialog: That was sick.
61) 8) dialog: I'm nineteen.

62) 1) text: Guess that goes for me too. SIMON (O.S.)
62) 3) text: Different how? SIMON (O.S.)
63) 0) text: He emerges in an UNDERGROUND PARKING LEVEL. Forty or fift cars and SUVs, 2000-2009, lie dormant, covered in dirt, dust, and debris. KABLE switches on a LIGHT built in to h weapon. The FLY CAM scans 360 degrees, independent of KABLE, givi them two sets of eyes. SIMON (O.S.)
63) 7) dialog: Think about it, Kable: all the shit we've been through together. What an epic run. (beat) It's going to suck to see it end.
63) 9) dialog: Well, yeah - I get that for you it's different.
64) 3) dialog: There's nothing there.
64) 5) dialog: (sarcastic) Uh, yeah dude, thanks for the visual, but it's a restricted area. It's beyond the borders of the game. I couldn't put you there if I tried.
65) 1) dialog: ... shit shit shit!
65) 2) text: He rolls behind a CRUSHED RIOT VAN and OPENS UP in the direction the shell came from, ash and debris from the im still raining down... and then: From behind, he's NAILED IN THE BACK by a SWUNG length of IRON PIPE. He half crumples, spins - HACKMAN. HACKMAN SWINGS AGAIN, knocking the WEAPON out of KABLE'S hand; it skitters across the concrete. SIMON is completely freaked - it's happening too fast, no time to react... he tries to engage HAND-TO-HAND but ever move pings a step late... KABLE swings a fist; HACKMAN dodges easily. HACKMAN is moving too naturally - as if he's under his own control. HACKMAN slams the    pipe off the side of KABLE'S head, D HIM - then tosses    the pipe away... and pulls out a nas high tech-looking    SHOTGUN. He stands over KABLE and po the barrel at his    FACE.
67) 2) dialog: (offended) Hey.
67) 3) text: KABLE sees GUARDS appearing and BLUES hurrying away from ambush positions - including the one who likely fired the mortar... session complete. KABLE cups a hand over his mouth, conspiratorially, and speaks directly into SIMON'S ear:
67) 5) dialog: What the hell...?
67) 8) dialog: But-
73) 0) text: SIMON is lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling - a GIA VIDEO SCREEN playing back key moments of that day's Slaye session in an endless loop. SIMON holds his fingers up in front of his face, zooming and rewinding the video with little fluid movements of his hands. Suddenly the screen GLITCHES OUT, goes dead for a second and when it comes back the battle images are replaced by GIANT FACE, surrounded by black, STARING DOWN AT HIM: HUMANZ BROTHER, early 30's; a savvy leader with an unforgettable presence.
73) 6) dialog: (confused) Software...
73) 8) text: SIMON puts it all together.
73) 9) dialog: No shit... you're the guy from TV. The HUMANZ.
73) 11) dialog: To what, um, brotha do you refer... brotha?
73) 13) dialog: You were listening.
73) 15) dialog: Alright, then. (considering) Kable said we got lucky - that they were gunning for us - what was that all about?
73) 17) dialog: Huh?   What things?
73) 22) text: Uh uh. Castle will never let that happen. SIMON
73) 24) text: You're not hearing me - this is not something you can control. They gonna kill his ass, Simon. In the eyes of the world. And then what? You just another poor little rich honky. No Kable, no pussy, no shit. SIMON can't deal. SIMON
73) 27) text: You want to win it, don't you? SIMON
73) 35) text: A mod, that's all. Like that guidance system you hacked on three weeks ago lets you track motherfuckers around corners and shit. SIMON (nervous)
73) 37) text: The game got to mutate, after all. It got to evolve, you feel me? SIMON
77) 1) dialog: (sarcastic) I can see turning you loose was a great idea.
77) 3) dialog: YOU happened, jackass. You wanted control, you got it.
77) 6) dialog: Yeah, that's right. So please don't fuck up...
78) 1) dialog: What's the matter with you Kable? Kill something!
79) 1) dialog: (frustrated) Fuck it.
79) 2) text: We see SIMON'S fingers glide, dial up the SWARMER... KABLE is still firing randomly as the turret shifts - the SWARMER goes STRAIGHT UP, then locks on BLUE and swerves on them like HELL FROM THE SKY, turning skulls to swiss cheese. Too close. SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd) (the voice of reason) Kable. Listen: it's the last game. You're going to be dead and I'm going to look like a total asshole if you don't pull your balls together!
79) 5) dialog: Dammit!
80) 5) dialog: Kable. Dude. What are you doing?
80) 6) text: KABLE unscrews the cap and sticks his finger down his thr Dry heave. He does it again - this time puts his mouth on the hole and PUKES PURE LIQUID INTO THE TANK. SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd) What the hell?
80) 7) text: He stops, doubled over, gasping for breath... then the feeling hits him again - and he heaves another fountain d the hole. A BLUE shows up in the opposite stairwell - KAB brings his WEAPON up to hip level and BLOWS HIM AWAY WITH LOOKING. His head is clearing. KABLE looks around, unzips his pants and PISSES INTO THE TANK. SIMON is slack-jawed, speechless. KABLE shakes out his head; we can see in his eyes that he regaining his senses; focusing in. He busts out the DRIVE SIDE WINDOW, gets in; tears open the steering column - A BLUE SLAYER shows up in the mirror - fuck! - He CRANKS TH IGNITION... VRUUUUMM, KACHUNK, KACHUNK... BOOOM! A 50mm SHATTERS the back window and punches a hole into the dashboard. KABLE checks what's left of the mirror.               HAC other BLUE SLAYERS are coming fast. SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd) GO, GO, GO!

100) 0) text: A DARK, underground VIDEO ARCADE... low ceilings, concret OLD SCHOOL - sort of a graveyard of lost games... the classics of the 80s - MISSILE COMMAND, DEFENDER, ROBOTRON CRANK, etc. The dimensions of the room are impossible to determine. A dozen or so PEOPLE - just BLACK SILHOUETTES the CATHODE RAY GLOW - are scattered around, banging butt giving it body english, racking up scores. TRACE leads KABLE through, toward the one BRIGHTLY LIT SP at the center of the arcade, an AIR HOCKEY table is blast with WHITE LIGHT from above. HUMANZ BROTHER, who we recognize from SIMON'S vid screen, and HUMANZ DUDE - mid long hair - are playing: CLACKCLACK, CLICK, CLACKCLUNK, CLACK... They are so wrapped up in their game that they don't appe to notice KABLE. HUMANZ BROTHER smacks a random 3-bank           WINNER.
101) 0) text: SIMON is in a stark interrogation room, alone, drumming h fingers on the table - thumb-to-pinky, pinky-to-thumb. Tr not to show how scared he is. The door clicks open and SEVERAL MEN enter. One SITS. We see them from behind, not their faces; SIMON nods waddup. The SEATED MAN pushes several PHOTOS across the table to SIMON. SIMON glances at the top photo as casually as he c manage - it shows SIMON in an MTV TRL-type setting, being interviewed in front of a live audience of teenage girls. When AGENT KEITH speaks, he is calm, conversational.
101) 6) text: Another photo shows SIMON on a JUMBOTRON posing with his fingers in the camera's face, throwing the motion control hand signal for FIRE and KILL... in another, he's being mobbed at an event, signing an amazing pair of breasts wi black marker. AGENT KEITH (cont'd) Pretty hot shit, aren't you? King Player.
101) 7) dialog: Good times.
101) 10) text: This SITS IN THE ROOM for a BEAT - SIMON considers severa responses, chooses NONE OF THEM. AGENT KEITH (cont'd) Simon, you're being held today suspected of aiding in the escape of a convicted murderer from a maximum security penitentiary. The charge is... beyond serious. Your hard drives have been seized - forensics is decrypting the contents as we speak. Your internet activity over the last ten years is being scrutinized and catalogued in minute, vivid detail...
101) 11) text: SIMON FLINCHES at this one.
101) 17) dialog: Yeah, um... I need something too.
101) 19) text: Do you now? And what might that be? SIMON swallows hard.
101) 20) dialog: Could you dudes do a sandwich like: peanut butter, almond butter, walnut butter... pecan butter, pistachio butter... pretty much any kind of, you know, nut butter. And Welch's grape. Dead silence. SIMON chews a HANGING CHAD off of a FINGERN
101) 22) dialog: It's awesome.
125) 0) text: A WHITE, MINIMAL ROOM - TABLE, TWO CHAIRS. We may recogni it from the VIDEO the humanz sent to SIMON. In one chair: MAN, 30s, beard and mustache grown out thick; in UNIFORM. KABLE sits down in the other.
135) 0) text: BLACK. A door opens, a switch is thrown... and SIMON is blinded by harsh fluorescent light. He sits up on a cot, wearing a white T-shirt and pajama pants; fucked up hair, groggy. He BELCHES.
135) 2) dialog: Cool.
136) 0) text: SIMON slides open the door to his room, peaks inside hesitantly. It's TRASHED. The FLOOR is littered with busted up electronics and garbage. The wall-sized screens are all running the same thing - a SINGLE WORD, repeated in colum by the thousands - scrolling fast, a digital waterfall of words, white on black:
136) 7) text: SIMON slumps against the wall, DEFEATED.
143) 0) text: SIMON is sitting on the floor, head hung low, in front of dead wall... a glitch, a flicker... the screen comes to l

148) 4) dialog: Sorry.
