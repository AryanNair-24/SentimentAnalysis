11) 11) dialog: I'd remind your audience that Slayers was put together with the full cooperation and approval of the United States federal government... that the revenue it produces is responsible for funding our entire prison system - keeping the bad guys behind bars... and that the prop was voted for by a cock solid 68% of the American public.
13) 3) dialog: There's a lot of men and women in prison that could never cut it as slayers... shouldn't they have the same opportunity to roll the dice for a ticket out? Besides - they only need to survive one session.
14) 2) dialog: Simple.
14) 3) text: A 3-D ANIMATED GRAPHIC accompanies his explanation - the VIRTUAL CAMERA zooms in to the FROZEN SOLDIER'S head - an then INSIDE, passing thru transparent layers. KEN CASTLE (cont'd) It begins with a single nano-cell planted in the motor cortex of the brain -- this cell can replicate, replacing the cells `round it with perfect copies...
14) 4) text: We see a cartoon image of a tiny nano-cell - labeled with bold, block letter N. The nano-cell approaches a normal c next to it... there is a flash; now the cell next to it h turned into an exact copy of the nano. This continues, multiplying exponentially, until we zoom back to reveal t the entire brain has been converted to nano-cells. KEN CASTLE (cont'd) ... these copied cells contain remote access functionality. Therefore, nano plus cortex equals the nanex.
14) 12) dialog: (coy) Did I? You know I seem to recall that - let's just see...
14) 15) dialog: You like her? Her name is Gina. She's a good little bitch.
16) 2) dialog: Similar, yep. But control is strictly localized to the parameters of our gaming environments.
16) 5) dialog: (teasing) To some, maybe... to some... don't you suspect a good many folks wouldn't mind an itty bit of control?
16) 11) dialog: Someone else making all the decisions for you... no responsibilities, no tough choices... think about it.
17) 1) dialog: Good little talk.
18) 12) dialog: Shush!
18) 14) text: Underneath is the CLASSIC ILLUSTRATION showing the progression from primitive EARLY MAN to the erect MODERN HUMAN. In a crude ANIMATION the progression CONTINUES: MODERN MAN bends back over on his hands and knees; in the final stage he's wearing a DOG COLLAR, getting fucked in ass - then fed through a MEAT GRINDER, packaged &amp; sol HAMBURGER. KEN looks over at the PRODUCER. KEN CASTLE (cont'd) That's a God damn hoot.
18) 19) text: Uh huh. You might wanna oughta let my boys take a look at your firewall. The screen CUTS TO BLACK, COLOR-BARS blink, then an advertisement streams in. KEN stands, holding GINA'S hand, kisses it. KEN CASTLE (cont'd) (to GINA)

139) 9) text: The VOICE comes from UNSEEN SPEAKERS; it seems to be everywhere at once, intimate. KEN CASTLE (O.S.) (cont'd) The latest and greatest... defy you to tell it from real life. You imagine porn on this thing?

Every instinct tells KA to go after him - but he holds back. Who knows if it's ev real? And then CASTLE starts to SING... ... or more precisely, LIP SYNC - the VOICE is SINATRA, I Got You Under My Skin... CASTLE is doing a spot-on KARAOK I've got you under my skin
140) 8) dialog: (genuinely stoked)
140) 11) dialog: Kable. They speak simultaneously: KABLE                               KEN CASTLE
140) 12) text: I don't care about you.               You don't care abou KEN CASTLE (cont'd)

141) 1) dialog: I've got to thank you for leading me to them, by the by - the human- zuzz that is... Snap out WIDE: the hallway seems to run along the SURFACE THE MOON - another 3-D projection, no doubt. CRATERS and LUNAR DEBRIS stretch to the horizon. The GEEK SQUAD walks along behind CASTLE and KABLE at a distance... they are a tiny MOON ANTS in the vast lunar panorama... the PLANET E rising majestically in the dark heavens. KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
141) 8) text: SNAP back to CASTLE, MEDIUM       CLOSE.     His eyes are CRAZY. KEN CASTLE (cont'd) I replaced 98% of my own noodle with nano-tissue years ago...
142) 1) dialog: But mine's different. (taps his FOREHEAD) Built to send - to transmit . Whereas every other K-soft cell out there - including the ones in... (taps KABLE'S forehead ) your head, Kable - is designed to receive. I think it, you do it.
142) 2) text: CASTLE looks across the court at HACKMAN; nods toward him HACKMAN drops the ball and begins to POP LOCK. KEN CASTLE (cont'd) We're talking every Slayer, everyone in Society City... I believe your better half would fall under that category... provided they're within range of my transmitters...
142) 9) dialog: You're thinking small, Kable. But not as small as me.
142) 10) text: He sinks his hands into the POWDER, brings them out and CLAPS, making WHITE DUST CLOUDS. KABLE waves the dust AWA FROM HIS FACE. KEN CASTLE (cont'd) See, nano cells are real small, a thousand times smaller than even these dust particulates... (KABLE coughs) Inhale it and they go to work: replicating, spreading... like a virus, multiplying in exponentials... six months time I could have 100 million people converted - ditch diggers, porn stars, presidents - and not one would be the wiser.
142) 11) text: Behind KABLE, HACKMAN lets the ball roll away and silentl TURNS TOWARD US. KEN CASTLE (cont'd) A hundred million folks that will buy what I want them to buy, vote how I want them to vote, do pretty much damn well anything I figure they ought to do.
142) 12) text: HACKMAN comes running at KABLE from behind, eyes burning, a full charge... running into FOCUS... holding the BOWIE KNIFE... KEN CASTLE(cont'd) For instance.
142) 18) dialog: (pleasant)
142) 22) dialog: Neglected to mention: my smart boys reversed that hack those fellas worked for you - easy breezy, once we had access to their drives... This is gut-wrenching for KABLE -- after tasting freedom, feels his will ripped away from him... HE'S BEING PUPPETE THE MAN HE HATES THE MOST. KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
143) 5) dialog: (on SCREEN) Come on, lets boogie woogie rock and roll.
144) 1) dialog: Biggest, baddest Slayer in the game... don't seem like much, does he?
144) 2) text: CASTLE is enjoying the hell out of himself. He uppercuts KABLE, snapping his head back... then shakes out his knuckles. KEN CASTLE (cont'd) Oww!
144) 3) text: KABLE swings his OPEN HAND around - CASTLE choreographs i perfectly: KABLE'S nails rake across CASTLE'S STOMACH, MARKING HIM UP like BRUCE LEE in Enter The Dragon. CASTLE strikes a pose to match. KEN CASTLE (cont'd) Lucky shot. (grins) OK, not really.
144) 4) text: He brings a passable REVERSE CRESCENT KICK that drops KAB to the floor. KEN CASTLE (cont'd) I need an audience, boys.
144) 10) text: He gives KABLE a last kick; KABLE collapses in front of h DAUGHTER... she looks down at him, curiously. He looks up at DELIA, eyes soaked with emotion... then to ANGIE. They share a moment of intense eye contact - we fe that ANGIE wants desperately to go to him but is unsure o what is the best action to take strategically; she is loo to KABLE for a clue. KABLE'S eyes go back to DELIA; he tries to reach up and gently touch her face... KEN CASTLE (cont'd) That's sweet.
144) 11) text: CASTLE steps on KABLE'S hand, pinning it to the floor. KEN CASTLE (cont'd) Alright boys, you ready? A true test.
144) 14) dialog: Just like last time. Remember?
144) 19) text: The GEEKS look on, impassive. The BLADE is inches away... looks into ANGIE'S eyes - she and KABLE are like one; he seems to draw strength from her... finally, KABLE WILLS EVERYTHING HE HAS and STABS THE KNIFE INTO THE FLOORBOARD Suddenly: KABLE's head SNAPS around, his eyes confused... and in on quick, smooth movement, KABLE YANKS THE KNIFE out of the floor, RISES TO HIS FEET AND SPINS ON CASTLE. He claps a hand around CASTLE'S neck and tries to jam the knife up i his GUT - but CASTLE is able to FREEZE HIM just short... KEN CASTLE (cont'd) (freaked) What the hell was that?
146) 1) dialog: (panicking)
146) 6) dialog: (like he's explaining the obvious to a child)
146) 7) text: I think it. KABLE, succumbing to CASTLE'S control, begins to move the knife away from CASTLE'S belly. KEN CASTLE (cont'd)
