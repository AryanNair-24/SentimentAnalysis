3) 14) text: Eat shit please. THWIPPP!! The BLUE drops like a sack. KABLE perfectly cut back another 90 degrees and runs for an old store front. Inside a CLERK "air" bags groceries for an empty store. A BROWN SOLDIER sets up a TRIPOD MACHINE GUN and aims for bunker a hundred yards north. The distant BLUE targets se almost robotically unaware. The BROWN SOLDIER plants his left hand on the ground for stability, right hand twistin the grip-lock - and squeezing the trigger: TAT TAT TAT TA TAT TAT!!!! TATATATATATATATATA TAT!! The BLUES fall, some clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to t ground, dead. Another team of BLUES rock their heads around to focus on him. Uh oh... BOOOOOSH!!!! The BROWN TRIPOD GUNNER is vaporized from th knees up... the FOREARM that supported him is standing straight up, cleanly severed at the elbow. It slowly wobb over and connects with the TWO LEGS severed at the knees. The THREE LIMBS fall into each other, forming a flesh and bone TRIPOD.
