45) 1) dialog: Hi.
47) 4) text: I like your fur. GORGE/ANGIE
48) 0) text: We get our first wider view of the room. Much more crampe than SIMON'S ROOM... like SIMON'S, the room is dominated GIANT VIDEO SCREEN, but just the front wall... there are other - smaller, paper thin - screens mounted in various spots and leaning against walls; GARBAGE and TECH GEAR al over the floor. GORGE - late 30s, MORBIDLY OBESE - is contained by a mass automated rolling chair, like the Escalade of Rascals. The HUMANZ message has taken over his screen and he's GOI FUCKING BALLISTIC, throwing shit at it and gesturing craz to the wall-mounted MOTION SENSORS with his hands, trying get the image back. It's NOT HAPPENING.
102) 0) text: FAT FINGERS squeeze air. ANGIE, in a white tank top and panties, is pulled to 3-D SIZE DIMENSIONS on GORGE'S video wall, standing impassive in space. A FAT TONGUE wets FAT LIPS.
103) 0) text: ANGIE is on the sidewalk, a little unsteady on high heels wearing the outfit GORGE CHOSE. OTHER PEOPLE are wandering around everywhere. A DEBUTANTE type in a pink ensemble has a poofy SHITZU on a leash; th SHITZU is PISSING ON IT'S OWNER'S LEG, but she doesn't se to notice. A TAXI speeds by with FOUR PEOPLE crushed in t back seat having CRAZY ANIMAL SEX. ANGIE starts walking. She passes a FAMILIAR FACE, who turns to watch her go, without expression - is that GINA PARKER SMITH? ANGIE walks around the corner to a BAR and goes in.
104) 9) text: In GORGE'S apartment his lips move, ANGIE'S echoing to ma ANGIE (cont'd) I thought you weren't allowed to come here anymore.
106) 6) text: She TURNS. KABLE has RICK RAPE up in the air, holding him like a BAR - with one hand CRUSHING HIS THROAT, the other his BALLS. brings him down over his knee, SNAPPING HIM like a BROKEN - KKRRUNCH. ANGIE'S FACE is passive, neutral... but her EYES are NUCL with EMOTION. KABLE tosses RICK RAPE'S broken body into the bedroom... falls to his knees in front of ANGIE and takes her face i his palms, gently - EYES LOCKED INTO HERS. GORGE is paralyzed.
106) 8) text: ANGIE says the words, but they don't match her eyes. just shakes his head, trying to grasp the situation. GORGE/ANGIE (cont'd) I'll do anything.
106) 10) text: GORGE holds out his hands; ANGIE'S fingers caress KABLE'S chest and move toward his crotch... KABLE (cont'd) Stop.
106) 13) text: GORGE swallows; KABLE is staring straight into his eyebal
106) 26) text: Say anything else and I'll find you... I'll rip you TO FUCKING PIECES, do you understand me? GORGE/ANGIE nods. KABLE (cont'd) (to ANGIE)
109) 2) text: The ELEVATOR stops and picks up TWO PASSENGERS: a GIGGLIN NECKING COUPLE. The doors CLOSE. HACKMAN gives GORGE/ANGIE a wink and flashes a NINE INCH BOWIE KNIFE, carbon steel, nasty. ANGIE'S eyes go wide wi TERROR. The COUPLE is oblivious. GORGE can't hold back, the SICK FUCK; he squirms in his chair, sweating buckets, feeling himself up. And when he speaks, ANGIE echoes:
111) 1) dialog: 
111) 3) text: CONTINUOUS SHOT: GORGE/ANGIE starts running across the street, leading the way;
122) 0) text: GORGE'S EYES SNAP OPEN. He SPAZZES OUT like a turtle on i shell, a moment of panic - he's been PASSED OUT in his ch and doesn't immediately know where he is. He looks around DARK ROOM nervously; takes a hit of OXYGEN. On the SCREEN, society is gone - there is only a nebulous TEST PATTERN. Behind him, a SOUND.
122) 1) dialog: Hooz there? He runs his hand along the CHAIR'S TRACKBALL CONTROL, it SPINS around and rolls forward a bit. CASTLE'S GEEK SQUAD is standing in the room, silhouettes the dark - scary. GORGE (cont'd) (freaked)
