1) 0) text: POV: we are RUNNING, ragged, full sprint, down a TUNNEL towards dirty white DAYLIGHT... NO MUSIC - just heavy breath, KABLE'S HEARTBEAT and the s of his boots bouncing off the concrete... Others are running with us - SOLDIERS with weapons... at tunnel's end: vaguely defined shapes of buildings, smoke, sky... Our POV WHITES OUT as we...
2) 0) text: ... smash into the DAYLIGHT. Smoke plumes hang from a recent skirmish. KABLE climbs ov burning debris, gun raised, as SANDRA and the other soldi disappear into the grey mist.
3) 0) text: KABLE emerges from the smoke into...
3) 14) text: Eat shit please. THWIPPP!! The BLUE drops like a sack. KABLE perfectly cut back another 90 degrees and runs for an old store front. Inside a CLERK "air" bags groceries for an empty store. A BROWN SOLDIER sets up a TRIPOD MACHINE GUN and aims for bunker a hundred yards north. The distant BLUE targets se almost robotically unaware. The BROWN SOLDIER plants his left hand on the ground for stability, right hand twistin the grip-lock - and squeezing the trigger: TAT TAT TAT TA TAT TAT!!!! TATATATATATATATATA TAT!! The BLUES fall, some clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to t ground, dead. Another team of BLUES rock their heads around to focus on him. Uh oh... BOOOOOSH!!!! The BROWN TRIPOD GUNNER is vaporized from th knees up... the FOREARM that supported him is standing straight up, cleanly severed at the elbow. It slowly wobb over and connects with the TWO LEGS severed at the knees. The THREE LIMBS fall into each other, forming a flesh and bone TRIPOD.
3) 22) text: We sense emotion in KABLE'S cold eyes - then they flicker the peripheral.
3) 26) text: KABLE spins, TOO LATE - BUT: from the level directly below the SNIPER - through a open doorway - we see a BROWN SOLDIER, BLASTING STRAIGHT THROUGH THE CEILING! The BLUE is BLOWN TO CHUNKS.
3) 33) text: Bullets and shells chop up everything around KABLE, but h QUICK... A SHELL smacks his shoulder HARD, almost knocking him off feet - shredding the BROWN CAMO and revealing the FLEXIBL BODY ARMOR UNDERNEATH. He scrambles to the octagon's entrance and BAILS IN.
4) 0) text: KABLE steps into the middle of the vacant steel room. The second he breaks the GREEN LASER, FLOOD LIGHTS blast on a around the BATTLEFIELD. A SUBMARINE ALARM sounds from loudspeakers everywhere, echoing through the streets, CYC DOWN. The battle is over - session complete.
5) 0) text: KABLE steps out.    The LEDS on his weapon blink off in sequence... ARMED GUARDS are EVERYWHERE, rounding up the I-Con's. [I-CONs (I-Convicts) are the combatants -- death row inmates/lifers, of which there are never a shortage. GENERI-CON's (Generic Convicts) are the street traffic th lend unpredictability and realism to the battlefield... t are computer controlled NPCs (non player characters)... p thiefs and criminals who are risking their lives by participating to commute their sentences] A DOZEN GUARDS collect weapons - TWO approach KABLE. His eyes are pure MURDER; SANDRA'S brain matter still drips f him.

6) 3) dialog: (quietly) My name's Tillman.

20) 0) text: Fingers run through white powder, making patterns. A black shadow crosses the frame, accompanied by a low hu some sort of aircraft. KABLE looks up as the shadow tracks across him; we never the craft. He looks out across the yard. KABLE is sitting in what seems to be a minimal REC AREA c out of the white terrain. He sits by himself wearing a wh cloth hoodie, eyes dark, head down, silent. Across the ya a group of prisoners are playing basketball; EVERY SINGLE PLAYER is SKYING for dunks. We focus in on KABLE'S TATTOO: I Am Right Here With You.. In the yard a CRIPPLE, his two legs stiff with braces, wa ROBOTICALLY along on crutches. KABLE watches him, expressionless. It triggers a memory...
22) 1) text: Kable. Kable. We see that KABLE has drawn the pattern in his tattoo wit his finger in the white powder; at the sound of the voice runs his hand through it, wiping it away. A wiry, jittery dude of indeterminate age is sitting next KABLE. KABLE doesn't even turn to look. KABLE

22) 10) dialog: I killed my best friend.
23) 2) text: KABLE is alone in his cell. At the base of the single door is a SLIDING COMPARTMENT t push food through - it opens. But instead of a tray, some pushes through a wrinkled photograph. KABLE picks it up and looks - a WOMAN, just a blur of gol hair, laughing, and a LITTLE GIRL... the same one in KABL vision.
23) 4) text: KABLE is stunned, silent. He sits on the ground, shoulder leaning against the heavy door, staring at the girl in th picture. WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd) It's all you think about. It's the only thing that keeps you alive.
23) 6) dialog: Who's talking?
23) 9) dialog: What?
23) 15) text: This takes KABLE by surprise; he reluctantly takes the pe and card. He writes something on it and sticks it back through the slider. PFFHHT. The WOMAN stabs KABLE'S hand with a LANCET - she draws out a little blood. KABLE yanks his hand back out. WOMAN (O.S.) (cont'd) Need to prove it's authentic. Makes it worth more.
23) 16) dialog: Why would anyone want my name?
23) 19) text: KABLE jumps up and pulls himself against the door - a lifeline is slipping away...

37) 2) text: Wait for it... CLOSE-UP of KABLE'S EAR: just then he hears the SUBTLEST SOUNDS creeping up behind. Whoever's controlling him does seem to have noticed - he's too focused on the enemies in sights. We can see the tension in KABLE'S FACE - he's helpless, trying to fight it, willing his player to take notice. KABLE (whispering)
37) 4) text: What'd he say? A trickle of sweat runs down into KABLE'S EYE. The SOUND more distinct now, CLOSER... he's practically shaking fro the struggle to overcome the control. POV: someone has reached the top of the stairs... KABLE, from behind, comes into view crouched by the blown out window. VOICE (cont'd)
37) 10) text: KABLE SPINS - FAST. The TURRET is ALREADY REVOLVING when squeezes the trigger... The ARMOR-PIERCING SHELL takes SNEAKY BLUE by surprise, blowing him out the back of the building... The BLUES in the street take notice. It's a matter of seconds... KABLE makes a run for it as the floor starts to DISINTEGR behind him in a shitstorm of bullets. SHRAPNEL drills his back, absorbed by the BODY ARMOR.

42) 0) text: SIMON'S ROOM is simple - FOUR WALLS and a CEILING, each o 3-D, corner-to-corner VIDEO SCREEN. The HD level of the screens is virtually ABSOLUTE - the flesh and blood SIMON himself is just another element in a HIGH-DOLLAR/HIGH-TEC SPACE. The FLOOR is ALL BED. SIMON PADS IN, takes a spinning STU JUMP and ROLLS onto his back in a big ass pile of pillows sandwich intact. The SCREENS are a jumble of floating frames, competing fo prominence in the 3-D space... muted VID CHATS, STOCK TICKERS, SPORTS SCORES, ultraviolent SLAYERS playback, et Everything dynamic, everything moving. One whole wall is apparently a REAL TIME monitor of the SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND, with updated statistics... POINTS LEADER, FRAG COUNT - we notice that KABLE leads these categories; a video loop of KABLE in action beside his na illustrates the point. In the FOREFRONT of SIMON'S attention: KABLE EARNS 800 UPGRADE POINTS
42) 44) text: Fifty million euros for control of Kable, instant transfer to the account of your choice. SIMON

42) 54) text: What the fuh...? ... waits a beat... and SHOOTS THE OTHER MAN IN THE HEAD. Black blood pools. This is REAL. The loop repeats. When the SHOOTER turns his face toward the camera, SIMON freezes the frame with a gesture and ZOOMS IN. It's KABLE. A MESSAGE is typed across the screen one letter at a time we may recognize the retro chicago font from the HUMANZ v prank earlier: want to talk to him?
47) 6) text: We are somewhere. He WINKS; reaches out and puts a hand on her WAIST. They start to make out like TEENAGERS at the PROM. DALE/GUY LI UP HER SKIRT with one hand and SQUEEZES A BOOB with the other. He turns her around and presses ANGIE'S back up against t base of the sculpture, ROUGH, hands all over her/inside h SLOBBERING down her neck and shoulders... ANGIE just looks straight ahead... her EYES move to a nea building - the side is an ANIMATED BILLBOARD that has switched to a promo for SLAYERS, with KABLE featured prominently. She watches KABLE'S face move... she lets out an involunt MOAN that is more like a whimper... DALE/GUY (cont'd)
50) 11) text: Across the room KABLE notices a NEW GUY - a mean-looking sunofabitch... in fact, if murder were personified it wou look exactly like HACKMAN. HACKMAN stares straight at KABLE. There is something in h ghost of a smile that says he'd be more than happy to eviscerate you... it's off-putting to say the least.
50) 12) dialog: Freak.
50) 15) dialog: Who the hell is that?
51) 0) text: KABLE and the GUARD are ANT-SIZED in what looks like a massive driving range. VIRTUAL TARGETS are holographicall projected in mid-air at various heights and distances. Ot PRISONERS are there too, a ways off; well out of earshot. KABLE looks over a Swarmer cartridge, slams it into his weapon; switches turrets, takes a bead on a VIRTUAL TARGE We see him intentionally PAN THE SIGHT OFF to the left of target; he pulls the trigger - CLICK. The TARGET - and several others close by - turns RED, BLINKS - a HIT. This thing doesn't just take out individuals; it takes out VICINITIES.
51) 3) text: Who aims... the slayer? Or the player? KABLE narrows his eyes, focuses across the field, where o PRISONERS are being briefed and UPGRADED... he spots HACK KABLE

51) 31) dialog: Yeah, probably.
51) 33) text: KABLE'S eyes narrow - What? HACKMAN disappears; he starts to move along an ADJACENT R OF LOCKERS, slamming the doors - SINGING fucking PINOCCHI HACKMAN (cont'd) I've got no strings...

59) 2) text: They spot another BROWN advancing toward a group of BUILDINGS; SIMON moves KABLE to join him. Just as KABLE g there a BLUE KICKS OUT A DOOR and opens up with an ASSAUL SHOTGUN, shredding the BROWN. Two more BLUES POP OUT of a DITCH on the OPPOSITE SIDE, TRIANGULATING. KABLE ROLLS - BIG AMMO displacing the air just inches abo his head and BLOWING OUT the windows/tires of an ABANDONE CAR behind him - switches TURRETS and comes up FIRING... armor-piercing shells: BOOM.

61) 11) text: KABLE doesn't even register this. His darting eyes pick u familiar face in the chaos: FREEK. FREEK has apparently volunteered as a generi-con - he is dressed as a postman, pulling a cart of mail behind him a walks across the street.
61) 13) text: It all happens too quickly: A BROWN scrambles behind FREE and ducks down, using him as a moving human shield; squee off a few shots - FREEK is chopped up by incoming gunfire the BROWN keeps running... there's nothing KABLE can do. An explosion nearby pushes them forward.

Time STOPS; KABLE sees the shell moving through the air a inch from his nose in ULTRA SLO-MO... his cheeks ripple f the displaced air...
65) 2) text: He rolls behind a CRUSHED RIOT VAN and OPENS UP in the direction the shell came from, ash and debris from the im still raining down... and then: From behind, he's NAILED IN THE BACK by a SWUNG length of IRON PIPE. He half crumples, spins - HACKMAN. HACKMAN SWINGS AGAIN, knocking the WEAPON out of KABLE'S hand; it skitters across the concrete. SIMON is completely freaked - it's happening too fast, no time to react... he tries to engage HAND-TO-HAND but ever move pings a step late... KABLE swings a fist; HACKMAN dodges easily. HACKMAN is moving too naturally - as if he's under his own control. HACKMAN slams the    pipe off the side of KABLE'S head, D HIM - then tosses    the pipe away... and pulls out a nas high tech-looking    SHOTGUN. He stands over KABLE and po the barrel at his    FACE.
65) 4) text: He SQUEEZES the TRIGGER... The SUBMARINE ALARM SOUNDS.       FLOODLIGHTS CRANK UP. The LEDs on HACKMAN'S gun POWER DOWN with an audible down cycle... a shell, undetonated, drops from the barrel and plops onto KABLE'S FOREHEAD. HACKMAN (cont'd) What happened?

67) 6) text: This is unthinkable, dangerous talk.

71) 0) text: ... the CAMERA pulls away, continuing the motion: we are wide view of the outside of the building, a rundown brownstone on a rundown street - animated advertising cov half the side of the structure...

75) 18) dialog: I need you to get me something.
75) 22) text: What, Kable... what can I get you? KABLE stares into the DARK, turning it over in his head, looks up at the WINDOW in the door, a simple black rectan and on the other side, his only LIFELINE.
75) 23) dialog: Drunk.

79) 2) text: We see SIMON'S fingers glide, dial up the SWARMER... KABLE is still firing randomly as the turret shifts - the SWARMER goes STRAIGHT UP, then locks on BLUE and swerves on them like HELL FROM THE SKY, turning skulls to swiss cheese. Too close. SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd) (the voice of reason) Kable. Listen: it's the last game. You're going to be dead and I'm going to look like a total asshole if you don't pull your balls together!

SIMON is slack-jawed, speechless. KABLE shakes out his head; we can see in his eyes that he regaining his senses; focusing in. He busts out the DRIVE SIDE WINDOW, gets in; tears open the steering column - A BLUE SLAYER shows up in the mirror - fuck! - He CRANKS TH IGNITION... VRUUUUMM, KACHUNK, KACHUNK... BOOOM! A 50mm SHATTERS the back window and punches a hole into the dashboard. KABLE checks what's left of the mirror.               HAC other BLUE SLAYERS are coming fast. SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd) GO, GO, GO!
