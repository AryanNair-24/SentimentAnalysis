50) 11) text: Across the room KABLE notices a NEW GUY - a mean-looking sunofabitch... in fact, if murder were personified it wou look exactly like HACKMAN. HACKMAN stares straight at KABLE. There is something in h ghost of a smile that says he'd be more than happy to eviscerate you... it's off-putting to say the least.
51) 14) text: KABLE gets a bead for a headshot on HACKMAN.
51) 18) dialog: Hey. Kable.
51) 24) dialog: No. Wait. Look.
51) 25) text: He brings his HANDS out where KABLE can see them - they a SLICK WITH FRESH BLOOD. HACKMAN (CONT'D) (cont'd) I just deleted someone.
51) 26) text: HACKMAN is almost GIGGLING, high on it. HACKMAN (CONT'D) (cont'd) This is the blood. Look.
51) 27) text: HACKMAN rubs his SLIPPERY HANDS together, relishing it; h nods his head toward the area behind the lockers... to ca the situation CREEPY would be a serious understatement. HACKMAN (cont'd) He's back here. Want to see?
51) 29) text: HACKMAN cracks his neck. Maybe not. KABLE pulls on his PRISON GREYS quickly, refusing to make EYE CONTACT.
51) 30) dialog: I'm going to delete you too. On Sunday.
51) 32) dialog: That's why they put me here.
51) 33) text: KABLE'S eyes narrow - What? HACKMAN disappears; he starts to move along an ADJACENT R OF LOCKERS, slamming the doors - SINGING fucking PINOCCHI HACKMAN (cont'd) I've got no strings... So I have fun... I'm not tied up to anyone... They've got strings But you can see There are no strings on me...
51) 39) dialog: On the outside... oh, I'm sorry - I meant your pretty girls... You want to get back to them but I'm going to visit them first... KABLE is instantly ALL BUSINESS - he's going to make HACK disappear RIGHT THE FUCK NOW... He JAMS around the corner but HACKMAN is NOWHERE TO BE SEEN... past another row of lockers - NOTHING... another. another... WHERE THE HELL IS HE? NOWHERE. KABLE SLAMS a FIST into a locker, BUSTING it off it's hin
52) 0) text: The CAMERA ANGLE on HACKMAN begins to switch perspectives spin around, as though someone is manipulating it in thre dimensions.
52) 8) text: He changes the angle on HACKMAN'S mug to give a better vi then turns to face his DOUBLE... CASTLE (cont'd) (proudly) The new face of Slayers. Pure crystallized horror, two stories tall and covered in bloody red... (beat) He's so what they want.
65) 2) text: He rolls behind a CRUSHED RIOT VAN and OPENS UP in the direction the shell came from, ash and debris from the im still raining down... and then: From behind, he's NAILED IN THE BACK by a SWUNG length of IRON PIPE. He half crumples, spins - HACKMAN. HACKMAN SWINGS AGAIN, knocking the WEAPON out of KABLE'S hand; it skitters across the concrete. SIMON is completely freaked - it's happening too fast, no time to react... he tries to engage HAND-TO-HAND but ever move pings a step late... KABLE swings a fist; HACKMAN dodges easily. HACKMAN is moving too naturally - as if he's under his own control. HACKMAN slams the    pipe off the side of KABLE'S head, D HIM - then tosses    the pipe away... and pulls out a nas high tech-looking    SHOTGUN. He stands over KABLE and po the barrel at his    FACE.
65) 3) dialog: (friendly) Bye Kable.
65) 4) text: He SQUEEZES the TRIGGER... The SUBMARINE ALARM SOUNDS.       FLOODLIGHTS CRANK UP. The LEDs on HACKMAN'S gun POWER DOWN with an audible down cycle... a shell, undetonated, drops from the barrel and plops onto KABLE'S FOREHEAD. HACKMAN (cont'd) What happened?
67) 0) text: KABLE seizes the opportunity to jam a foot up into HACKMA BALLS, buckling him. He twists HACKMAN'S LEGS into a pret and throws him off.
74) 0) text: [ "I WANNA ROCK" continues...] One light... HACKMAN'S FACE, glistening with sweat, is th only thing partially visible in the inky black... the CAM slowly ZOOMS into his EYES... twin pools of MADNESS... of MURDER...
107) 7) dialog: (friendly) Hi, Kable.
109) 0) text: HACKMAN and ANGIE are having a pleasant ride down, HACKMA hands folded in front of him, patiently; the SHOTGUN - st smoking - shoulder strapped.
109) 1) dialog: (to ANGIE) Anybody in there?
109) 2) text: The ELEVATOR stops and picks up TWO PASSENGERS: a GIGGLIN NECKING COUPLE. The doors CLOSE. HACKMAN gives GORGE/ANGIE a wink and flashes a NINE INCH BOWIE KNIFE, carbon steel, nasty. ANGIE'S eyes go wide wi TERROR. The COUPLE is oblivious. GORGE can't hold back, the SICK FUCK; he squirms in his chair, sweating buckets, feeling himself up. And when he speaks, ANGIE echoes:
109) 4) text: HACKMAN raises his eyebrows - he wasn't expecting that on but he OBLIGES. A flex of his shoulder; the NECKING GIRL' legs buckle under her and she goes down without a peep.
110) 0) text: KABLE grabs HACKMAN with both hands, RIPS HIM OUT OF THE ELEVATOR and SLAMS HIM into a WALL. A BRUTAL HEAD-BUTT to the FACE, smashing bone... ANOTHER. HACKMAN'S FACE erupts with BLOOD. HACKMAN SWINGS BLIND with the BOWIE KNIFE, once, twice - blade misses KABLE, backpedaling, by fractions of inches; displacing some SERIOUS AIR... HACKMAN lets it FLY. The BOWIE whistles past KABLE'S FACE and THUNKS into the wall behind him, four inches deep. HACKMAN smears the BLOOD from his eyes and brings up the SHOTGUN, but KABLE is quick - instead of trying to move a HE STEPS IN, pushing the barrel STRAIGHT DOWN as HACKMAN FIRES. The BIG HIT puts a CRATER in the floor and takes o a set of HACKMAN'S toes. KABLE kicks the SHOTGUN from HACKMAN'S hands and brings u his own WEAPON to close the deal... ... as the GLASS WALLS of the LOBBY EXPLODE. MORE SLAYERS are MOVING IN. KABLE releases a barrage of cover fire, grabs ANGIE and breaks for the BACK EXIT.
142) 0) text: They leave the hallway and step on to an indoor, NBA regulation BASKETBALL COURT; electronic scoreboard, bleachers, the whole nine. It's dark, moody - only one ba of OVERHEAD FLOODS is turned on. At the FAR END of the COURT, HACKMAN is in WARM-UPS, shoo baskets. ONE leg - the one with the ABBREVIATED TOES - is a FLEX BRACE. The GEEK SQUAD grabs seats in the BLEACHERS.
142) 2) text: CASTLE looks across the court at HACKMAN; nods toward him HACKMAN drops the ball and begins to POP LOCK. KEN CASTLE (cont'd) We're talking every Slayer, everyone in Society City... I believe your better half would fall under that category... provided they're within range of my transmitters...
142) 3) text: CASTLE chuckles at HACKMAN; HACKMAN stops dancing, jogs o picks up the ball and resumes shooting.
142) 11) text: Behind KABLE, HACKMAN lets the ball roll away and silentl TURNS TOWARD US. KEN CASTLE (cont'd) A hundred million folks that will buy what I want them to buy, vote how I want them to vote, do pretty much damn well anything I figure they ought to do.
142) 12) text: HACKMAN comes running at KABLE from behind, eyes burning, a full charge... running into FOCUS... holding the BOWIE KNIFE... KEN CASTLE(cont'd) For instance.
142) 13) text: KABLE hears HACKMAN at the last second, spins and ABSORBS TACKLE. The men GO TO THE GROUND, grappling, UFC-style. KABLE has HACKMAN'S KNIFE HAND by the wrist, stopping it but leaving his face UNPROTECTED... HACKMAN brings his free ELBOW down on KABLE'S face, connecting and opening a CUT under his eye; then AGAIN - time KABLE catches the elbow with his own free hand and WRENCHES IT IN SIDEWAYS, dislocating HACKMAN'S shoulder w a sickening POP.
