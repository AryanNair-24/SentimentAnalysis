23) 136) dialog: Well ... for the last four years I've been on call to Triple A Escort service. Jack and Frank exchange a glance.
23) 137) dialog: (continuing)
23) 140) dialog: I sing now?
23) 142) dialog: I Get Along Without You.' Slowly, okay? Jack nods and begins to play.   Frank slouches down in his chair, preparing to be tortured again.
23) 143) dialog: (continuing; singing)
23) 144) text: I get along without you very well Of course I do Except when soft rains fall And drip from leaves, then I recall The thrill of being Sheltered in your arms Of course I do But I get along without you very well.' Susie stops.  Frank just sits there.   Jack just sits there.  She can sing.
23) 145) dialog: (continuing)
23) 149) dialog: When?
23) 151) dialog: (smiling)
23) 153) dialog: (continuing)
23) 154) text: Yeah, well, okay.  'Bye, Bakers. Susie walks out barefoot.
24) 3) text: Jack and Frank whirl around. There, standing in the doorway, is Susie.
24) 4) dialog: Intuition.
24) 9) text: Ready? Susie nods.  Frank poises his hands over the piano, hesitates, then looks at Jack again.
24) 11) text: Ready? Jack squints at Frank, then nods.   Frank turns to Susie.
24) 14) dialog: (looking around)
24) 16) dialog: (continuing)
24) 17) text: Sorry. Frank poises his hands over the piano again and begins to play the opening passage of "Just the Way You Are." A moment later, Jack joins in, and a moment after that, Susie.  Unfortunately, Jack and Frank, accustomed to playing alone, are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a fifth grade recital. After a few bars, Susie holds up her hand.
24) 18) dialog: Fellas, fellas ... Jack and Frank stop.
24) 20) dialog: The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this... (searching)
24) 22) dialog: (continuing)
24) 24) dialog: (continuing)
24) 28) dialog: What I mean is --
24) 30) dialog: So work with me, not against me. Okay? Frank stares at Susie for a long moment.
24) 34) dialog: Okay.
24) 38) text: No, I wouldn't say she's got a body like an angel. As Frank continues to talk in the background, Susie looks over at Jack.
24) 39) dialog: Hey, he's not sore, is he?
24) 43) dialog: Not for money. With my mother. Jack nods slowly, but Susie sees he doesn't understand.
24) 44) dialog: (continuing)
25) 23) dialog: Where's my name?
25) 25) dialog: And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
25) 27) dialog: Changed?
25) 29) dialog: (to Jack)
25) 32) dialog: Do I look like I'm naked?
25) 34) dialog: What's wrong with it?
25) 36) dialog: (to Jack)
25) 37) text: Am I missing something? Before Jack can reply, Frank grabs Susie's hand and pulls her toward the door.
25) 39) dialog: Hey!
25) 41) dialog: Time for what?
26) 0) text: Frank, Jack and Susie dash through a cavernous downtown department store, the brothers turning a few heads with their tuxedoes.  As they reach the ladies' department, Frank begins to flip through the dress racks.
26) 1) dialog: If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
26) 3) dialog: (offended)
26) 6) dialog: I wear a seven.
26) 8) dialog: (looking)
26) 14) text: Close enough.  Let's go. Frank begins to drag Susie into the dressing room.
26) 15) dialog: Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
26) 18) dialog: (from the dressing room)
26) 21) dialog: Nine!
28) 2) dialog: What do you think?
28) 4) dialog: (turning to Jack)
28) 6) dialog: (continuing)
28) 9) dialog: They're tight.
28) 11) dialog: Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
28) 13) dialog: Oh, thanks.
28) 15) dialog: You're a prince.
29) 4) text: Who's this, Minnie Pearl? All eyes turn to Susie's dress, which still has the tags attached.
30) 3) dialog: (deadpan)
30) 6) dialog: Piece of cake. A tiny MAN in an apron walks up with a meat cleaver.
32) 0) text: Susie sits on a stool while Carlos positions the dress ta on a cutting board.  As a WAITRESS from the bar passes by Susie snares a drink from her tray.
32) 2) dialog: Just a sip.  To kill the butterflies, okay?
32) 4) dialog: There.  No one's the wiser.
32) 6) dialog: Appreciate it, Ace.
32) 13) dialog: Switch? (as she hits it)
32) 15) dialog: (continuing; very demure)
32) 16) text: Pardon me. Jack and Frank look at one another, then, before outrage can set in, plunge into the opening number.   Susie takes the mike from the stand and smiles sweetly.
32) 17) dialog: (continuing)
32) 19) dialog: (continuing)
33) 0) text: A BELLBOY exits the elevator and, hearing Susie's voice coming from the lounge, stops.   He looks to the CLERK behind the front desk.
34) 0) text: Judging from the faces, Susie's as big a hit in the lounge as she is in the lobby.  Head thrown back, eyes closed, she sings with abandon, finishing on a long extended note, then swooping down in a dramatic, exhausted bow.  There is a split second of silence, then thunderous applause.  Magic.
35) 2) dialog: I said I was sorry.
35) 6) dialog: Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
35) 9) dialog: For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it. (pulling out some bills)
35) 13) dialog: Hey!
35) 15) dialog: (innocent)
35) 18) dialog: Then I want my name on the poster. And my picture! (taking off her shoes)
35) 19) text: And these shoes are too goddamn tight! Susie hurls the shoes at Frank and stalks off barefoot. Jack is leaning against the wall, watching it all with amusement.
36) 7) text: By the time they reach the lobby, they are laughing, tripping across the carpet, out the front entrance and onto the sidewalk, where their voices explode in the night air and they begin to do a weird boyish waltz together, laughing giddily, until they see - standing under an awning, lighting a cigarette - Susie, watching them with raised eyebrows.  Jack and Frank, frozen in a clumsy embrace, quickly disengage and begin clearing their throats and squaring their cuffs.  Susie exhales a plume of smoke, studies them a moment, then smiles slightly.
36) 8) dialog: Night, Bakers. As she turns away, Jack glances up, watching her trim shadow disappear down the street.
41) 0) text: In the front window, room has been made among the photographs for one of Susie.  Inside, Jack, Frank and Susie sit at a table, surrounded by empty coffee cups and cigarettes.  Frank has several slips of paper before him with names and dates.
41) 4) dialog: The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd. Susie, as she says this, is pouring sugar into her Coke.
41) 7) dialog: We take the Avedon, right?  Simple. Frank rubs his chin and looks at Jack.  Jack shakes his head.
41) 8) dialog: (continuing)
41) 11) dialog: Oh. (lifting her glass)
41) 14) dialog: (likes "resort')
41) 18) dialog: Maybe it's legit.
41) 24) dialog: How'd you guys used to decide what gig to take? Jack and Frank exchange a glance.
41) 26) dialog: So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
42) 15) dialog: Where's egghead?
42) 17) dialog: (searching her purse)
42) 20) dialog: Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit. Jack offers his pack of cigarettes.
42) 21) dialog: Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes. (still searching)
42) 24) dialog: Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads. (shaking the purse)
42) 27) dialog: Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best. (finding one)
42) 29) dialog: (continuing)
42) 33) dialog: You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
42) 35) dialog: No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
42) 36) dialog: (continuing)
42) 39) dialog: I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
42) 41) dialog: Nothing personal -- Jack holds up his hand.  Susie just stands there.
48) 0) text: All done up in reds and greens for Christams Eve. Jack, Frank and Susie -- each decked out in their own little Santa hats -- perform "Silver Bells" for the happy crowd. Jack, smoking a cigarette, will not be mistaken for Santa Claus, but Susie looks adorable. Frank just looks happy. As they finish, the crowd applauds.
50) 0) text: Jack and Frank step out into the lobby, thus giving a few people, Susie among them, the curious privilege of seeing Santa Claus exit a men's room.
50) 4) dialog: (coming up)
50) 8) dialog: He do that every year?
50) 10) dialog: Aren't the kids asleep?
50) 12) dialog: So why's he do it?
50) 14) dialog: Call me a cab, will ya?
54) 0) text: Jack is sitting on a suitcase in front of his building. A moment later, Frank pulls the car up to the curb and Jack gets in.  Susie is sitting up front.
55) 5) text: Uh, Jack ... if you don't mind. Jack stares at the back of Frank's head, then puts the cigarette away. Susie takes a peek in the donut bag and looks a little sick.
55) 7) text: By the way, if anyone gets bored, Donna packed some travel games. They work wonders with the kids. Frank reaches under the seat and hands Susie a sack full of magnetic games, puzzles, and plastic cubes.
55) 10) dialog: Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
55) 12) dialog: How long did you say it takes to get to this place?
56) 0) text: Jack is staring out the window at the winter landscape, an unlit cigarette dangling from his lip.   Susie is gnawing on a donut, deeply obsessed with an elaborate plastic puzzle.
56) 2) dialog: Uh-uh.  Hey, what's this? Susie notices an old, leather-bound ledger.  Inside, there are hundreds of tiny entries.
56) 3) dialog: (continuing)
56) 6) dialog: Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
56) 8) dialog: Virgins?
56) 13) dialog: (consulting the ledger)
56) 18) dialog: (scanning the book)
56) 27) dialog: I don't believe it.

59) 2) dialog: Hey, we're connected.
59) 4) dialog: Great?
60) 0) text: Jack, Frank and Susie are in the dining room, which, like their rooms, looks out over the ocean.   Dinner is over and they're well through a second bottle of wine.
60) 1) dialog: You're kidding me.
60) 3) dialog: Peggy Lee?
60) 11) dialog: What'd she sing?
60) 13) dialog: Wow. You ever see her again?
60) 18) dialog: They must've bought the same map we did.
60) 20) dialog: I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
60) 23) dialog: Oh yeah?
65) 0) text: Frank is adjusting his tie in the bathroom mirror. Jack, sitting at the window, his foot up against the glass, drinks from a flask as the sky above the ocean goes dark.  After a moment, Susie enters wearing a little tuxedo of her own and begins to brush her hair.
65) 1) dialog: Hey, fellas.  What's the word? Nothing.
65) 2) dialog: (continuing)
65) 5) dialog: 0-kay.
66) 0) text: As Jack, Frank and Susie perform "Strangers in the Night, dozens of couples move slowly on the dance floor, while others sit at candle-lit tables, sipping cocktails. As the song ends, the couples applaud.
66) 2) text: You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends.   And family.  Right, Jack?
66) 8) text: So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
66) 9) dialog: Huh?
66) 11) dialog: Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
66) 19) dialog: What's with you guys?
67) 0) text: Middle of the night.  Jack, fully clothed, is sitting on the rim of the tub, smoking. Susie enters.
67) 1) dialog: Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
67) 4) dialog: Can't sleep?
67) 6) dialog: It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
67) 8) dialog: How's egghead?
67) 10) dialog: In and out. Jack nods.  Susie looks at him carefully.
67) 11) dialog: (continuing)
69) 3) text: You haven't seen Susie, have you?
69) 11) text: And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
70) 3) text: I wonder if you could turn this way so your face isn't in the shadows. As Jack turns, he glances over Florence's swaying shoulder and sees Susie and a man standing at the other end of the walkway.  They are leaning into the wind, her hair blowing free, brushing the man's face.
70) 6) text: Gotcha.  Would you like a copy for yourself?  The hotel develops. Jack glances away from Susie and the man.
72) 0) text: Jack is sitting in the bathroom again, smoking.  He hears Susie's door open, then VOICES -- hers and a man's.  He puts out his cigarette in the sink and leaves.
73) 0) text: The next morning.  Frank, the early bird, is returning to the room with a newspaper under his arm. Whistling happily, he rounds the corner just in time to see a man exit Susie's room.  Astonished, then outraged, he goes to Susie's door and knocks sharply.
73) 1) dialog: (opening door)
73) 4) dialog: Huh?
73) 6) dialog: Uh ...
73) 8) dialog: Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
73) 14) dialog: Some discussion.
73) 25) text: Unlike me. Frank looks at Jack, then Susie.
73) 27) dialog: Forget it. The three stand there awkwardly for a moment.
73) 29) dialog: Boy, he comes on like a hurricane in the morning, doesn't he? Jack just stares at her.
73) 30) dialog: (continuing)
73) 33) dialog: It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
74) 0) text: Jack, Frank and Susie are sitting at a table in the smaller dining room.  It is conspicuously quiet.   The main course seems to be a conscious attempt to ignore each other.  Finally, Susie looks at Frank.   Then Jack.  Then out the window.
74) 1) dialog: Paradise.
76) 5) dialog: Lest old acquaintances be forgot ... As the voices slowly fade, they are joined by the sound of the OCEAN until the ocean is all we hear and we see:
80) 10) dialog: (distracted)
82) 0) text: In a lounge whols basic decor makes abundant use of several historical eras but which might best be described as Modern Pilgrim, Jack, Susie and Frank perform "Feelings," while waiters in huge Paul Revere hats pass in and out of view.
82) 1) dialog: Feelings ... Wo wo wo ... Feelings ... Wo wo wo ... Feelings ...
82) 3) dialog: I can't sing it anymore.
82) 5) dialog: That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
82) 7) dialog: I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it.   Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
82) 9) text: Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
82) 10) dialog: And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore! She's yelling.  The kitchen workers are glancing over. Jack studies her as she tries to calm herself.
82) 11) dialog: (continuing)
83) 0) text: A few minutes later.  Jack comes out of the hotel and sees Susie pacing.   He sits down and watches her for a moment.
83) 4) dialog: Guess I got a little scattered.
83) 6) dialog: How do you do it? Every night?
83) 8) text: There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few. Susie nods.  Jack studies her.  Something's on her mind.
83) 9) dialog: Listen... (looks into his eyes)
85) 0) text: Susie is working on a Paris Opal, pacing, occasionally glancing up at Jack's apartment, where the MUSIC can be heard FAINTLY.  After a moment, she drops her cigarette on the sidewalk.  There are half a dozen others already there.
87) 0) text: As Jack comes out of his building, Susie stops pacing, surprised.  Jack, wearing the same look of concentration he had at the piano, doesn't see her and turns down the other end of the street.  Susie starts to call after him, but stops.
90) 1) dialog: You were good. Jack stops.  Susie.
90) 3) dialog: Better than that. Jack's face goes a little cold, but he says nothing, beginning to walk again.
90) 4) dialog: What's the matter?
90) 6) dialog: What'd I say?
90) 8) dialog: You're upset.
90) 10) dialog: All I said was you were good.
90) 13) dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
90) 15) dialog: You were good.
90) 17) dialog: You were good.
90) 20) dialog: (yelling)
90) 21) text: Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit! Jack studies Susie, then glances off.  For a moment, they just stand on the corner, not talking.
90) 22) dialog: (continuing)
91) 2) dialog: Who's Nina?
91) 4) dialog: Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
91) 6) dialog: Ed? How many people live here? Eddie walks around the couch and looks curiously at Susie.  Jack moves to the kitchen.
91) 8) dialog: (a look)
92) 0) text: Light from a weak lamp, lots of shadows, as romantic as Jack's apartment will ever get.  Outside the window, the city looks like a thousand jewels, gleaming. Susie cradles a drink in her hand as she moves slowly about the room, slipping, in and out of the shadows as if they were veils.
92) 1) dialog: (at window)
92) 4) dialog: I don't know.  I guess I didn't trust the night like she did. Susie finishes her drink and sets it down.
92) 5) dialog: (continuing)
92) 7) dialog: (continuing)
92) 9) dialog: (continuing)
92) 12) dialog: Soap convention.
92) 14) dialog: Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ... (shaking her head)
92) 15) text: Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out.   But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby. Susie takes a long draw and blows the smoke out slowly.
92) 16) dialog: (continuing)
92) 18) text: But I stayed at the Hartford once.  You should see the rooms.  All satin and velvet.  And the bed.   Royal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow.  Hard to believe sleeping in a room like that don't change your life.  But it don't.  The bed may be magic, but the mirror isn't.  You wake up the same old Susie. (pause)
92) 19) text: I didn't always, you know.  If I liked the guy ... Susie looks at Jack, but he just takes a drink.  She looks out the window again.
92) 20) dialog: (continuing)
92) 22) dialog: (continuing)
92) 25) dialog: Huh?
92) 27) dialog: No kidding? It's a small phone booth.
92) 28) dialog: (continuing)
92) 31) dialog: Oh. So what's it doing here?
92) 33) dialog: You sending me home? Jack locks eyes with Susie, then glances away.
92) 35) dialog: Nervous?
92) 37) dialog: You're kidding.
92) 39) dialog: So, what happened?
92) 43) dialog: Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
92) 45) dialog: Oh. Jack glances out the window.
92) 46) dialog: (continuing, carefully)
92) 48) dialog: (continuing)
92) 52) text: He drank a lot that day. Susie studies Jack as he stares into his glass.
92) 56) text: I was laughing when it happened. Jack stares at the glass in his hands, then glances up and catches Susie looking at him.
93) 0) text: Jack's bed.  In the darkness, we see Susie's profile, her eyes looking up toward the ceiling.  Jack's body falls slowly across her and he kisses her neck.
95) 0) text: Susie is dressed, sitting at the piano, staring out the window as she absently hits a key.  She is smoking one of Jack's cigarettes.  Distracted.  Jack comes to the doorway and watches her.  Plink.  Plink.  Plink.
95) 2) dialog: Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
95) 4) dialog: Yeah... No.
95) 6) dialog: Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes! Susie throws the cigarette out the window, then looks down.
95) 7) dialog: (continuing)
95) 11) text: Why don't you go.  I'll see you tomorrow night at the Ambassador. Susie doesn't move.
95) 12) dialog: I followed you last night.  I mean, I was here.  Outside.  I was about to come up when you came out. Jack waits.
95) 13) dialog: (continuing)
95) 14) text: The reason I came by ... I couldn't tell Frank... I'm leaving.  The act. Susie stares up at Jack, but he says nothing.
95) 15) dialog: (continuing)
95) 16) text: It's a ... I met this guy at the resort.  He liked my voice.  And, it's ... He thinks I can sell cat food just by singing about it.  Can you believe it? Susie tries a laugh.  Jack nods.
95) 17) dialog: (continuing)
101) 0) text: Jack, walking home, turns a corner and suddenly stops. Across the street, talking to a man, is Susie.  She says a few words to the man, then touches him lightly on the arm and begins to walk away.  Jack watches her retreat, then follows, moving quicker as he draws close.  As he reaches her, he gently touches her elbow and she turns. Not Susie.  The woman stares at Jack, startled.   For a moment, he doesn't move.  Finally, he lets go of her elbow.
110) 1) dialog: I thought the Bakers didn't take tips. Jack glances up, but he knows the voice.
110) 3) dialog: Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
110) 5) dialog: So ... ?
110) 7) dialog: Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
110) 9) dialog: Yeah.
110) 11) dialog: Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week. Jack nods.
110) 13) dialog: Huh?
110) 15) dialog: Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones. Susie tries a smile.  Takes a breath.
110) 16) dialog: (continuing)
110) 20) dialog: No kidding?  Well ... I guess you can't do a reunion over tomato juice, can you? (pause)
110) 21) text: Anyway, if you're ever in the neighborhood ... I wrote it down. Susie takes a slip of paper from her purse and hands it to Jack.  They lock eyes for a moment.
110) 22) dialog: (continuing)
110) 27) text: You got pretty eyes. Susie smiles.  As she leaves, Jack studies the slip of paper in his hand, then drops it in the tip glass.   He glances at the door, swinging slowly shut in Susie's wake, then reaches into his coat and takes out a bottle.
115) 0) text: Jack stands in an apartment hallway, waiting.   After a moment, the door opens.  It's Susie.
115) 1) dialog: Jack.
115) 3) dialog: Well, this is some surprise. (seeing his face)
115) 4) text: Hey ... You don't look so good, pal. Susie studies Jack as he glances around the hallway.
115) 5) dialog: (continuing)
115) 7) dialog: (continuing)

115) 9) dialog: (continuing)

116) 1) dialog: I used to do that. Jack turns.  Susie is looking at him.
116) 2) dialog: (continuing)
116) 5) dialog: (smiling slightly)
116) 8) dialog: Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over.   Like a song. Jack looks at Susie for a long moment, then nods and turns for the door.
116) 9) dialog: (continuing)
116) 11) dialog: (continuing)
116) 14) dialog: Okay.
