We now see they are walking up a desolate HILL through a of DESICCATED BODIES. Thousands of them. It's a killing ground. Death on an epic scale. Like a battlefield where the victims are frozen in their death throes, like the PETRIFIED REMAINS from Pompeii. Crouched, cowering, terrified, trying to escape, folded i horror, pleading upward ... Some stand tall -- much talle than the crew -- facing their deaths defiantly. Others ar collapsed in fetal terror and agony.

A strange dry RUSTLING. Like a whisp breath. She leads him toward the source, through a door... 70. INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S GALLERY - DAY It is simply breathtaking. A long GALLERY, filled from top to toe with ART. Gorgeous renderings of bones, skeletons, muscles, relics, insects, animals. Exquisite detail. Like the work of pioneering Victorian naturalists. Some are HUGE and have scaffolding in front of them to re the top. Others are tiny ... Many are in process. There are open casements here -- good light for drawing - the parchments and papers shift gently in the breeze, lik they're breathing. This was the sound they heard.
