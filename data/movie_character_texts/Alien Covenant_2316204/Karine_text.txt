14) 2) dialog: Easy, Bill. INT. COVENANT-DANIELS’ CABIN Too big for one really. She sits, hunched on the king size bed. Her fingers unconsciously touching her wedding ring as he eyes move over the room... her husband’s shoes next to he in the closet... his collection of old vinyl RECORDS and PHONOGRAPH. Her eyes stop at the pictures of them on the dresser. She goes to the dresser, starts removing his clothing...

46) 0) text: Meanwhile, KARINE has filled a few mylar sample bags with flora and fauna. Mostly plants and a couple of seemingly uninteresting insects and worms. She gently bats at a cloud of INSECTS in front of her fac haze of little mote-like MIDGES in the dappled sunlight. And we see one of the insects--
46) 4) dialog: You’re covered in midges. The insects evaporate in the sunlight. 37. Ledward, unconcerned, points to a little mammal, some kin furless thing. Half-eaten. Dead. Its side bubbles with fa white grubs. She kneels, looks at it, disturbed.
46) 6) dialog: No idea. But we know one thing now -.. There are predators here ... Could you bag it for me? She moves away to use the field radio as Private Ledward the dead creature. And we focus on one of the INSECTS hovering near him...

59) 0) text: A BLAST of light. The MEDBAY is high key white. White on white. It's barely controlled hysteria, quick and urgent. Faris pulls on gloves and a mask as Karine swiftly wrench off Ledward’s body armor.
59) 2) dialog: Little late for that. They HEAVE LEDWARD onto a table -- then Karine scrambles through med cabinets, spilling supplies--
59) 4) dialog: We’re gonna get you up to the ship and get you fixed up - you just have to hold on for me, Private. Okay? Can you do that? Faris discretely backs out of the room:
