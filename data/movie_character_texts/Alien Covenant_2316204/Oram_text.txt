He is joined by his male partner, SERGEANT HALLET, a Secu Officer...
13) 12) dialog: Captain. Hallet looks at him, unsure.
13) 13) dialog: I’m sorry I’m late, Captain.
13) 15) dialog: (to Walter) Report.
13) 19) dialog: (interrupts) What are the chances of something like this happening again?
13) 23) dialog: Let’s worry about repairs first.
13) 26) dialog: (snaps ) And if we don’t make repairs we could lose all the colonists -- and they are the entire point of the mission, in case you need reminding, ladies and gentlemen.
13) 30) dialog: Well -- do we even know if he was religious?
13) 36) dialog: How long before we can make our next jump?
13) 38) dialog: Then let’s go to work. Dismissed. 12. They disperse. Tennessee mouths to Faris: “Dismissed”? Oram talks to Daniels privately.
13) 39) dialog: You should take a few days off.
13) 41) dialog: That wasn’t a request. She looks at him evenly.
13) 42) dialog: Look, Danny, I know Jacob and I didn’t always see eye to eye. But I’m responsible for the mission now -- and I need you at your best. Take a couple days. Cry it out,okay?

A Biohazard-suited team (PRIVATES LEDWARD and COLE) is sorting through the mess of pale corpses, preparing them burial. Zipping them into body bags. It's tough, physical work and Ledward and Cole fumble wit one of the bodies as they put it into a body bag.
14) 1) dialog: (snaps) Some reverence for the dead, please. They exchange a look: asshole. KARINE, monitoring some of the sleep pods, shoots a look Oram:
17) 0) text: The coffin-pod shoots from the ship... Arcing away dramatically as the song swells... And is finally gone. INT. COVENANT-BRIDGE - “MORNING” Next day. RICKS, UPWORTH and FARIS are at their stations. TENNESSEE is again working in space. CAPTAIN ORAM and WAL enter:
17) 6) dialog: Granted and welcome back. How you feeling?
18) 2) dialog: What the hell is that?
18) 8) dialog: Speaking in tongues... They look at him.
18) 9) dialog: I was raised Pentecostal. Real hell and brimstone. This sounds like speaking in tongues ... Mother. Slow down the signal to discrete word patterns. And reverse it.
18) 11) dialog: The Devil’s tongue is God's language inverted. The language of lies.
18) 13) dialog: On audio. A VOICE... Still distorted and eerie. But human. Female. Urgent.
20) 3) dialog: Where is it?
20) 5) dialog: All right, let’s take a look.
20) 8) dialog: What do you mean?
20) 10) dialog: I understand that but--
20) 12) dialog: What does it cost us to take a look? A few weeks?
20) 16) dialog: Look, I know you and Jacob had big plans about having a family on Origae-6 and--
20) 18) dialog: But what if this place is better? A better habitat for the colony--

COVENANT-DANIELS’ CABIN - LATER She’s lying on the bed, smoking a joint. Deep in thought. One of her late husband’s records spins on the old fashio turntable. Jazz plays.
23) 4) dialog: Bring us into close orbit. 27.
25) 9) dialog: Prepare the Lander. The crew, aside from Daniels and Walter, is delighted. Hi fives and hollers.
29) 0) text: FARIS pilots the craft. CAPTAIN ORAM and WALTER are also stationed on the bridge. The others are elsewhere in the ship. TRAJECTORY MODELS tick by, the ship INVERTING as it DROPS
31) 1) dialog: What’s going on...?!
31) 3) dialog: Oh God-- The ship starts to SHAKE VIOLENTLY from ENTRY. Faris’ ten mounting, hitting MORE BUTTONS--
36) 1) dialog: What the hell happened up there?
39) 2) dialog: Faris, we’re heading out. Keep expedition security protocols in place. She looks out the windows and sees...

40) 2) dialog: All right then. Let’s go find our ghost ... Walter? WALTER heads toward the treeline in the distance. Sergeant LOPE snaps open a beautiful folding BOW. Black carbon fiber. He strings an arrow and leads the way ... H men take up defensive perimeter positions. The expedition team is: Daniels; Walter; Captain Oram; Karine; Sergeants Lope and Hallet; Privates Cole, Ledward Anker.
42) 0) text: They discover a beautiful FOREST STREAM, flowing down fro the distant mountains. And life. Midges and tiny INSECTS buzz about the water, like dust motes, catching the light shafts slashing down through th trees. It’s a bit of a miracle. Life. CAPTAIN ORAM smiles, his hand gently moving through the h of little insects. Suddenly SERGEANT HALLET jumps back, shocked-- 33.
42) 3) dialog: It's not just possible - it’s predictable. Life is the result of very basic forces. Find a planet in the triple point, add sun and water. Thermodynamics starts the process - with a little luck, evolution does the rest. (smiling) But I’1l admit this is... beyond all expectations.
43) 2) dialog: Almost halfway to target... life everywhere... Beyond anything... The signal dissolves into NOISE. The HOLO TERRAIN MAP twitches.
44) 4) dialog: (nods ) Sergeant, can you provide security? Sergeant Lope motions to PVT. LEDWARD, who joins Karine.
44) 6) dialog: Don’t touch anything icky. Karine smiles. The expedition team continues on.
45) 3) dialog: What do you think, Daniels? We could probably put the whole Covenant down here. Looks like a perfect landing site. Ready access to fresh water too... (gestures, imagining it) Put the housing modules over there, civic modules across the way. Instant colony!
45) 5) dialog: We were meant to find this place. Daniels glances at him. Odd thing to say. Oram continues past them, trooping away, disappearing in swaying stalks. Daniels and Walter continue on through the jungle of tall grass and come across LOPE and HALLET. Lope has pulled down one of the long stalks and is crushi the top in his hands, tastes a bit with the tip of his tongue.
47) 1) dialog: Slow down, Sergeant, we’re not all soldiers... A PING! Walter stops, frowns at his NAV DEVICE - 38.
53) 0) text: DANIELS, WALTER and ORAM explore the enormous NAVIGATION CHAMBER. Oram shines a light on EMPTY ENGINEER SLEEP PODS as Walte investigates the old COMMAND CONSOLE. 41. There’s a pulsing LIGHT under one of the controls. Walter activates it. Instantly, the HOLOGRAM message they saw before flashes t life and begins to play quietly. SHAW kneeling, praying: SHAW’S IMAGE (HOLOGRAM) --. “and let perpetual light shine upon them, May the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace ... Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord, and let perpetual...” Walter steps straight through the HOLOGRAM then turns it
53) 4) dialog: Is this her? Walter shines his flashlight, crisply registering the ite in the area. Decaying clothes. Some personal items. And then SHAW’S HELMET. He goes stock still when he sees the logo on the helmet.. WEYLAND INDUSTRIES. 42.

60) 2) dialog: Hold on, we’re close.
70) 5) dialog: What?! Faris, repeat ... Come in Lander One... They run now-- 51. Sergeant Lope helps Hallet along, but Hallet is really suffering-- The Lander is almost visible through the trees now, they’ almost there--
75) 0) text: ORAM and the others are just clearing the trees in the distance when--
75) 14) dialog: Yes. Yes. Let’s go. They gradually follow David. But Daniels turns to see... LOPE lingers long enough to go back to his partner Hallet dead body. Kneels by it. Gently shuts the eyes. Kisses hi Sees Daniels has seen this. 56. A nod from her. Acknowledgment. She understands. They follow the others.
87) 0) text: The expansive roof offers a panoramic view over the silen city. A dead metropolis. Rome or Athens. COLE is working a radio a bit away. DAVID presides over a gorgeous and huge -- Engineer-sized ASTRONOMICAL MODEL. It has intricate wheels and rings to represent planetary orbits, moons, and the nearby astrono
87) 2) dialog: We don’t have any weapons that could do that.
87) 6) dialog: Any word from the Covenant? Over by the transmitter, COLE shakes his head.
87) 7) dialog: Keep trying them. All channels.
88) 2) dialog: You’ve been very generous.
88) 6) dialog: We’re a colony mission. There’s a sudden flicker in David's eyes. Excitement. Qui masked. But DANIELS notes it.
88) 8) dialog: Oh -- 3,600 more or less.
88) 10) dialog: Standard security detail, that’s all.
88) 20) dialog: He just wants to leave, knows we can help him.
88) 23) dialog: Look, I think both of you are--
88) 25) dialog: All right. (to Walter) Talk to him privately, see what you can find out.
88) 27) dialog: You two take a look around. But use some discretion.
102) 4) dialog: This is Captain Oram. We need immediate evacuation.
102) 6) dialog: Understood. Six bells.
102) 8) dialog: Tennessee, it’s Bill. Can you switch to a private channel...? The others move away. Daniels gives Walter a look: I need to talk to you. INT. CATHEDRAL-DAVID’S GALLERY - NIGHT WALTER and DANIELS are staring up at the horrible drawing the DISSECTED ENGINEER CORPSES.
103) 0) text: DAVID is leading CAPTAIN ORAM through subterranean corrid Dark and echoing. Dripping womb-like walls.
103) 6) dialog: What do you mean designed? You engineered this?
103) 10) dialog: Quite something, that’s for sure. 82.
103) 13) dialog: There were things like this on the ship, they grew out of a kind of black fur, like mold ... An evolution from the pathogen I take it?
103) 15) dialog: Alive?
103) 17) dialog: Waiting for what? But then... A flicker of motion from the side of one of the eggs... The MOUTH opens, spreading like a flower, shimmering tend of saliva as it yawns open... Oram takes a STEP BACK. David steps forward and looks in, if demonstrating. Nothing happens. 83.
104) 15) dialog: .-.. What happened?
104) 17) dialog: I remember some horrible dream about smothering. Oram sits up. Still weak.
104) 18) dialog: I’ve got to get something to eat, I’m starving.
104) 20) dialog: ... Why are you looking at me like that?
104) 22) dialog: Organism...?
104) 24) dialog: What does?! Oram suddenly JERKS painfully.
123) 0) text: Racks of “spare parts” for Walter. Complicated ROBOTICS machinery. WALTER watches impassively as his new LEFT HAND reattache itself to his arm. He flexes it. Works well. The “skin” begins to re-graft itself. He flexes his fingers, seems pleased to be whole again. INT. COVENANT-WARDROOM - “MORNING” A PHOTOGRAPH of the ENTIRE CREW. Before the launch. Befor the terror. Daniels and her husband, Oram and Karine, Tennessee and Faris, Lope and Hallet, all the others. The photo hangs on the fridge. TENNESSEE is alone, making breakfast. Looking at the phot DANIELS enters, just awake.
