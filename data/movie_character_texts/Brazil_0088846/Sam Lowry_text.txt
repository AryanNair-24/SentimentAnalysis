12) 1) text: CUT TO brilliantly clear sky. From on high an odd bird- like figure swoops down on the CAMERA. As it comes closer we can see that it is, in fact, a MAN wearing strange woo and metal bird wings. In the bright sunshine their flapping movements create a brilliant, flashing effect. Along with the wings, SAM LOWRY (for this is he) wears an outfit that combines the best of Flash Gordon and a WWI fighter pilot. He sweeps past the CAMERA and then, banking, rises BACK INTO SHOT IN MCU. An ethereal voice can be heard calling "Sam ... Sam ... Sam". He hovers, looking beyond the CAMERA to something wonderful. CUT TO face of stunningly beautiful GIRL, she is the idealised twin of JILL LAYTON ... Her long hair swirls across her face partially obscuring it and making her appear slightl mysterious. The CAMERA PULLS AWAY from her as soft billowing material sinuously undulates about her. It rise and falls like waves carried on the wind. As the CAMERA GLIDES BACK through this sea of gossamer we can see that the GIRL is being held aloft by and in it. A vast landscape stretches below her. The sun frames her in the sky. She and SAM are engaged in a beautiful sensual aeria ballet.
