0) 3) dialog: If you say so...
1) 3) dialog: There are no problems, Joy.   Only solutions.
1) 5) dialog: Okay, that's a problem. (thinking, then...) Call Matt Hardwick down at Media Services. He's got a few Sky Cams and he owes me. Now, where are my weathermen? Joy opens a door to a waiting area.
2) 0) text: Several portly LATINO MEN look up and wave at Abby.
2) 2) dialog: Hi, guys! Abby waves back and closes the door.
2) 6) dialog: What's with the pot bellies?
2) 8) dialog: I like the one in the green and the one in the brown, but I want to see the one in the green with less sideburns and the one in the brown with more, then I'll make my decision.
2) 10) dialog: Morning, Larry.
2) 12) dialog: You're not a man, Larry... (off his look)
2) 18) text: I like to think of them as aesthetically pleasing -- Abby steps away, not wanting to ponder Larry's balls anym than she has to. ABBY
2) 19) text: I think I've made my point. Larry nods, appeased, as she reaches the door marked ABBY RICHTER, PRODUCER, "ALBUQUERQUE A.M." She enters and...
3) 11) text: She doesn't eat crab or beef or fish. She doesn't eat anything but chicken. You don't need a chef on this show. You need a box of McNuggets. Everyone shouts at each other. Abby calmly pulls out a whistle, puts it to her mouth and BLOWS.
5) 0) text: Abby and Joy stand next to CLIFF, the show's director.
5) 6) dialog: It's just a matter of staring the chaos in the eye and showing it who's boss. Nice work, guys. She pats him on the back and heads out of the control roo

7) 1) dialog: I can't be letting corporate management dictate the content of this show. This is my show. I control it. She rips out an extra two feet of floss. ABBY (cont'd)                                   *
7) 4) dialog: Yeah, all 2.47% of them.
7) 9) text: Abby stops flossing and looks at Joy.
7) 10) dialog: You printed his profile?
7) 12) dialog: Well, technically eight and a half. He said he could cook, but when I pressed him, he was completely unfamiliar with cumin. Don't you think that's a little suspicious?
9) 0) text: Abby approaches the FEMALE HOSTESS, at her podium.
9) 1) dialog: Hi. I'm looking for a guy with sandy brown hair, athletic build, and blue eyes... he's 5'9 which -- I know what you're thinking -- it's a little short, but he's read The Great Gatsby twice, so we'll just live with it, okay?
9) 3) text: She turns, mortified, to see JIM, 30's and good-looking. Actually, he's better looking in person than in his photo Abby gulps.

10) 0) text: Abby and Jim sit at a table. Abby looks around, tense.
10) 1) dialog: You know what? This is not the best angle. We should get the table over there. Then we both get a view, instead of one of us looking at the busboy station.
10) 3) dialog: No, trust me. It'll be better over there.
10) 8) dialog: You know, they've done studies that show tap water is no different from bottled water. And they passed a law recently to have all restaurants filter their tap water. So, technically it's not tap water.
10) 16) dialog: In your profile, you said you liked red wine.
10) 19) dialog: (re the paper) Was there anything else you changed your mind about? I mean, just so I can figure it into the overall picture.
10) 21) dialog: Actually, my associate producer did. She likes me to be prepared. Not that I'm ever not prepared. Kudos on your comprehensive car insurance policy, by the way.
10) 23) dialog: No, but it was in your background check. (off his look; changing the subject) So...tell me about yourself.
10) 27) text: Well, what's left that you don't know? ABBY
10) 28) text: Good point. There's an awkward silence between them. She pulls out another piece of paper, and hands it to him. ABBY
10) 30) text: I take it it's happened before? ABBY
10) 39) dialog: Floss?
10) 42) dialog: FYI, be sure to eat this by tomorrow. With curry, you can't smell if it's gone bad, so after three days, you should just toss it. Really, don't even give it to a pet or anything.
10) 44) text: Abby has officially lost control to the producer part of herself...she knows what she's doing, but can't stop hers
10) 45) dialog: Here, just to be sure, I'll write today's date on it for you.

18) 12) dialog: What?
18) 14) dialog: Well, he's not like you, that's for sure.
18) 16) dialog: He's smart...he's handsome but doesn't know it... (enjoying the fantasy) He's successful, but in a job that means something. He loves red wine, classical music, Cary Grant movies...
18) 18) dialog: Are you interested in listening or not?
18) 20) dialog: He works out, not because he's vain, because it's healthy. He's socially liberal but fiscally conservative. He likes dogs but he's a cat person. He never gets out of bed before you on a Sunday morning --
18) 22) dialog: What?!
18) 28) text: Where is this guy? I will give you one hundred dollars of my own money to bring him down here and let me meet him. ABBY
18) 30) text: Wait a second. You're not even dating this guy?! ABBY
18) 32) text: You don't even know him?!? Mike bowls over LAUGHING. Abby realizes she's been had. MIKE (CONT'D)
18) 34) dialog: Excuse me? She rips the perfectly made bed apart and starts over. MIKE
18) 35) text: You heard me. You must be. If you were hot, you'd be out breaking some poor schmuck's heart instead of spending all your time fantasizing about Mr. Wonderful. Face it, you're ugly! ABBY
18) 40) text: Well, of course you don't think so. Ugly people never know they're ugly. It's like people who have B.O. They never know it because they're surrounded by their own stench all the time. Now Abby's really fuming. She snaps a sheet violently. ABBY
18) 42) text: Look, lemme help you out here. You might as well just face the fact that you're gonna be alone and stop pining away for some fantasy guy you're never going to get. Get a hobby. Build housing for the poor. Anything. ABBY
18) 45) text: Well that about wraps it up for today. I'm Mike Alexander reminding you that the truth is never pretty. As he smiles smugly, Abby SCREAMS and THROWS the phone ac the room. D'Artagnan, terrified, jumps off the bed, which now in total disarray.

19) 26) dialog: And he's a    quintessential misogynist    uber-moron who represents    everything wrong with television    and society at large... DORI
19) 28) text: He's got a point of view. We don't have to like him, we're news people. We're objective. Stone Phillips interviews terrorists, doesn't mean he likes them. It's good for ratings. Abby holds up a piece of paper. ABBY

20) 14) dialog: Imagine my relief.
20) 16) dialog: I'm sorry, what channel is your show on?
20) 18) dialog: This is channel two. You do know that the lower numbers are better, right? More people watch. So don't tell me that "you and I" make good TV. I am an award-winning news producer. I make good TV. You make imbecilic trash watched by housebound inbreds who are so busy putting their hands down their pants they're unable to change the channel.
20) 20) dialog: Let me tell you something. I am not one of your viewers. My cat stepped on the remote.

27) 1) dialog: Keep it clean, keep it moving, and stick to the script. You're on a live affiliate network news program. You do not have the luxury of using the words "blow" and "job" in the same sentence. If you say anything scatological, you're fired.
