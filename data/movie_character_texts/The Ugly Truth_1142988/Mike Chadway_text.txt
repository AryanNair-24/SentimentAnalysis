Get on it and get skinny and get some trashy lingerie because at the end of the day, all we're interested in is looks. No one falls in love with your personality at first sight, they fall in love with your tits and your ass. And they stick around because of what you're willing to do with them.

You already did irreparable damage with your psycho-aggressive control freak phone call. It might even be too late. Even if you do salvage the situation, you'll probably never be more than Abby, his desperate neighbor.
41) 25) dialog: Listen to you -- desperately asking me if you sound desperate.

42) 14) dialog: Make him wait.
42) 17) dialog: That's the point.
42) 19) dialog: Never. You make him wait until he gets frustrated and hangs up. If he's still holding on after thirty more seconds, you may actually have a chance.
42) 21) dialog: Think about it. Would you wait on hold for somebody you were trying to blow off?
42) 23) dialog: Just give me a little bit of time and I can make this guy your bitch.
42) 27) text: I don't want a "bitch." And Colin would never be a bitch. He's a well-rounded man capable of mature emotions and deep abiding love. Things which you know not of. MIKE

45) 3) dialog: No. Some men pretend to care. When we ask you how you're doing, it's just guy code for "let me put my dick in your ass."
45) 5) dialog: I know you think Colin is above it all, but he's a guy. If he's even remotely into you, he's thought about each one of your orifices at least ten times.
45) 7) dialog: I don't assume. I know.
46) 0) text: Mike and Abby walk along, coffees in hand.

51) 0) text: Mike avoids the cat while waiting in the living room.
51) 2) dialog: I don't want you to be a bimbo. You need to be two people, the saint and the sinner, the librarian and the stripper. It's a delicate balance. On one hand, you have to push the guy away with cold indifference and yet on the other hand be a sexually teasing tornado.

51) 27) text: "I mean what's the point of you even having one unless it's there for me to grab it? You're just a set of orifices and a pair of tee- tas." MIKE
51) 29) text: Maybe I'm just a good student. MIKE
51) 31) text: Doing what? MIKE
51) 34) dialog: Maybe. She gives him a look. ABBY
51) 36) dialog: Really... She leans in closer.
