2) 9) dialog: Abby! LARRY, 50's, the pompous, uptight anchor man, catches up them. He wears a makeup bib.
2) 11) dialog: I'm sorry to do this to you, Abby, but I don't think I can work with her anymore. It's bad enough I have to take her criticism at home. I can't do it on air, too. A man can only take so much. Abby nods, taking him seriously, but you can tell she's d this before.
2) 13) text: You're a newsman. A newsman isn't defined by the easy times, Larry, he's defined by the difficult ones. Can you imagine Ted Koppel or Chris Hansen or Anderson Cooper having their wives as co-anchor? Hell, no, because they couldn't handle it. But you can. You've got balls the size of Volkswagens. Don't think I haven't noticed.
2) 18) text: I like to think of them as aesthetically pleasing -- Abby steps away, not wanting to ponder Larry's balls anym than she has to. ABBY

21) 1) text: There is no way Mike Alexander is going to stay on my show. I want you to skewer him. Make him look like a complete idiot. Not that it will be hard. The man is a moron of unseen proportions. GEORGIA (re Larry)
21) 3) dialog: Does anyone think my highlights are too shiny? ABBY
21) 4) text: Larry, listen to me. I want Mike Alexander to go down in flames. I want Mike Alexander to be nothing but a pile of ash on the seat next to you. I want the janitor to come in with his Dustbuster and vacuum up the ashes of Mike Alexander, and then when he throws the ashes into the dumpster outside, I want the rats to vomit and then defecate on the ashes of Mike Alexander. She strides off. Larry looks at Georgia. LARRY

23) 30) text: My point? My point is that your husband hasn't had sex with you in...I'm gonna say. . .three months? LARRY
23) 36) text: I agree. You've economically emasculated your husband to such a point that he's afraid to desire you. Sure, you can dump his ass, but honey, have you seen the eligible men in Albuquerque? It's slim pickings out there for a woman in her forties. You're not going to do any better than Larry. You just have to let him be a man. LET HIM
23) 41) text: And you, Frowny McFlacid, give it to her. Now! Larry grabs Georgia and kisses her hard. After a moment o resistance, she melts into his arms. The crew goes crazy. Larry throws Georgia over his back and hauls her off the Abby sinks down into a chair. CLIFF
