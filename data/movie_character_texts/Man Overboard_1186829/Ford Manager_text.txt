75) 6) dialog: Who is it?
75) 10) dialog: Who is this? C.J. My name is C.J. Mason. I was calling to get a reference for Johnny Cross.
75) 11) dialog: Is he out of jail? Yeah, he worked for us for a few months. Sold a lot of cars. Stole a lot of money, too. Then he got in a fight with the sales manager and nearly killed him. And we had a mysterious fire the night before he disappeared. If you're thinking of hiring him, and you also have Satan as a candidate, hire Satan. C.J. (into phone) Okay, thanks. C.J. hangs up the phone, leans back in his chair, and breathes deeply.
