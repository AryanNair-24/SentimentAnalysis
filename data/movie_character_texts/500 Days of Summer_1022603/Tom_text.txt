18) 684) dialog: Can I say something about the cat?
18) 688) dialog: This here is, and Rhoda, you know I mean no disrespect... but this... this is total shit.
18) 692) dialog: "Don't give up?" "You can do it?"
18) 695) dialog: This isn't inspirational. It's suicidal. He tries that jump, I'm writing a sympathy card for that cat. That's the last thing I want to be doing with my life. It's bad enough writing these things for people.
18) 699) dialog: That's cause we're liars! It's what we do here. Why don't we level with people? Stop feeding them nonsense?
18) 707) dialog: Yes but think about it! Why do people buy these things? Not to say how they feel. There's paper and pens for that. People give these cards when they can't say how they feel. Or they're afraid to. And we provide the service that lets `em get away with that!
18) 708) text: Tom is getting excited. The rest of the room is growing uncomfortable.
18) 710) dialog: I say to hell with it! Let's level with America. Or at least make them speak for themselves! I mean, seriously, what's this... (picks a card off the
18) 714) dialog: Think about it. (picks up another card) "Congratulations on your new baby." Eh... How bout... "Congratulations on your new baby... Guess that's it for hanging out. Nice knowing ya, buddy."
18) 718) dialog: (picks up a card) Wait, what's this? Ooh... fancy! Look at this one with all the hearts. Let's open it up. "Happy Valentine's Day, Sweetheart. I love you." Oh that's nice.
18) 726) dialog: If someone gave me this card, Mr. Vance... I would eat it.
18) 729) text: Tom recognizes he's losing his shit. He takes a seat on t boardroom table.
18) 731) dialog: (BEAT) It's these greeting cards, Sir, these cards, these movies, these pop songs. They're responsible for all the lies, the heartache, everything! We're responsible!
18) 734) dialog: I think we do a bad thing here. People should be able to say how they feel, how they really feel, without some strangers putting words in their mouths. The truth. A card is a nice thought but it shouldn't do the dirty work for you. You love someone, tell them yourself, in your own words. Maybe it's not love at all. Maybe there's no such thing as love. Maybe it's... "galoogoo." (BEAT) Yeah I made it up, so what?!
18) 735) text: Tom gets up and walks to the door.
18) 737) dialog: It's all crap. We make and peddle crap. And sometimes people believe in this crap. I just can't do it anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough bullshit in the world without my help. I quit.
18) 748) text: Tom comes outside with some boxes. He stands out in front the building. His face says one thing. "Holy shit. Did I do that?!" And then we,

18) 772) dialog: And you said she was single at Christmas.
18) 780) dialog: And now she's...
18) 784) dialog: Now she's getting married.
18) 788) dialog: Married?
18) 792) dialog: It's impossible. It doesn't make sense. Where did they meet? Is it someone we know?
18) 796) dialog: So everything she said. All that stuff about... it can't be. Not her. I know her too well. She wouldn't do that.
18) 799) dialog: (BEAT) Fuck!

18) 996) dialog: I'll meet you at Liberty in... 20 minutes?
18) 1002) text: Tom and Summer are having a picnic. If it looks familiar, it's cause we saw them here on page 7. This is that fatef day Tom described to his sister and his friends. The day all, finally, fell apart.
