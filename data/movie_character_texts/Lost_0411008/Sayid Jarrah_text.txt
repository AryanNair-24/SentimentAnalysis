16) 35) dialog: (if he knows anything) -- We're on an island. This is all just buzz to Jack -- the same conversation ha been going all night. He's still in his own head space as Kate arrives, close -- almost conspiratorial:

19) 7) dialog: ...What_did you call me?
37) 17) dialog: I’ve had enough of this guy! You've had enough of me?! If You_accuse me of being a the shoe fits, buddy! Look criminal?! What next? I around! They all know it’s suppose you think I am you! I’m just the only one responsible for the crash! SAYING it!

37) 29) dialog: Yes, I might be able to.
37) 39) dialog: (re: transceiver) It’s dual-band. Military spec. Broadcasts full-range, far as I can tell. Chances are the battery is good, but the radio... it is dead.
37) 41) dialog: (stares at it, feels pressure) I need some time. Kate nods -- Sayid walks off -- just as Rose moves to Jac saying quietly:
38) 0) text: Sayid’s right at the edge of the fuselage, sitting on wreckage, using TWEEZERS and a found SWISS ARMY KNIFE to apart and examine the transceiver. Checking the internal connections. After a beat, Hurley arrives, sitting across from him. Saying one word, the sub-text being, “What a fucking pric
38) 4) dialog: Some people have problems.
38) 6) dialog: (amused) Us him. Hurley smiles back. Then:
38) 8) dialog: (considers Hurley) You're okay, too.
38) 10) dialog: Sayid. As Sayid works:
38) 12) dialog: I was a Military Communications Officer.

40) 0) text: Kate returns, dressed now -- as Sayid finishes wrapping t radio in black electrical tape.
40) 2) dialog: Seems to be -- except we’re not picking up a signal.
40) 6) dialog: -- Yes, but it’s a “transceiver” -- it transmits and receives. Which means you can also read the level of other signals that you are picking up. (shows her) What you want is to see little bars. Right here. shows her where RECEPTION BARS would normally be. there are none.
40) 7) dialog: The little bars would show that the radio is getting reception. Meaning we'd be in range of another radio. There are no bars here.
40) 9) dialog: -- We could broadcast blind. Hope that someone... maybe a ship, somewhere, picks up our distress call. But that would be a waste of the battery. Which might not last for long.
40) 11) dialog: We need the bars. (then, with a thought) It is unlikely, but perhaps worth a try.
40) 13) dialog: Sending a signal from high ground.
45) 0) text: Sayid puts the TRANSCEIVER in a plastic bag, then wraps i a beach towel. Nearby, Kate fills an empty water bottle w RAIN WATER collected on the TARP. She seems determined he Driven.
45) 1) dialog: The others. They've heard about the thing you saw. The pilot. (off Kate's surprise) I understand why you and the doctor decided not to frighten us, but your English friend is telling anyone who will listen. (beat; grim) They think we are insane for going back in there. Kate hesitates. Then --
45) 3) dialog: I don't like it here. But you... you don't like it here even more than I do. (off her look) I agree, sending a signal from high ground -- this is something we need to do. (beat) But your... willingness to go back in. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
45) 6) dialog: After you saw... whatever it is you saw. It is either impressive. Brave. Or something else... I can't really understand. Sayid's looking at her now -- with those deep eyes -- alm as if looking into her soul... and God, it unnerves her.
48) 0) text: As Kate and Sayid finish ZIPPING PACKS as Shannon, then Boone, arrive --
50) 0) text: On Kate, with Sayid at the head of the group. Charlie, Shannon and Boone behind her in that order. They're just entering the jungle -- the growth gets thick quickly. And now we CUT BACK TO SAWYER, who moves quickly, determi through the jungle -- passing Boone, Charlie, Shannon -- Sayid and KATE, who he looks at, walking with her for a moment. Their eyes lock. She's surprised -- and not pleased.
51) 0) text: WIDE SHOT. Spectacular view. Our SIX HIKERS (Kate, Sayid, Charlie, Shannon and Boone, with Sawyer at the front, hac away plants with a found stick) trudge through the jungle the base of the MOUNTAIN. The hike isn't any fun. Plus, it's HOT. Also, they're scared. Kate especially -- lookin around with concern as they walk. Afraid that, at any moment, that Thing might show up to end their lives. Now WE FAVOR Shannon and Charlie, who walks beside her:
56) 3) dialog: We're not gonna have any reception yet --
56) 5) dialog: I don't want to waste the batteries --
56) 7) dialog: -- We're still blocked by the mountain --
56) 9) dialog: If I just CHECK, we might not have any juice left when we get to -- A sudden RUMBLE -- they all turn to look toward the SOUND coming from the OVERGROWN GRASS FIELD -- something LOUD - something COMING, FAST -- and they all FREEZE, afraid -- (CONTINUED)
60) 7) dialog: 
63) 9) dialog: No, this is, uh... polar bears don't live near this far south --
63) 16) dialog: (confronting him too) One of the bodies.
63) 28) dialog: I_know who you are. You're the prisoner.
63) 30) dialog: You found_a_gun on awU.S. Marshal? Yes, I believe you did. You knew it was there because you were the one he was bringing back to the States. Those handcuffs were on you. (everyone stares at Sawyer, nervous ) That's how you knew there was a gun --
63) 33) dialog: That's who you are, you son-of-a-bitch!
63) 35) dialog: You accuse me, but you are the prisoner! (CONTINUED)
63) 45) dialog: There's a button on the grip -- push that, it will eject the magazine. And Kate does it: it POPS out with a solid metallic SNAP.
63) 46) dialog: But there's still a round in the chamber -- hold the grip, pull back on the top part of the gun -- She does that -- the bullet POPS out. She tosses Sayid th clip. She picks up the bullet. Hands Sawyer the worthless gun. He takes it, somehow amused by her.
65) 0) text: Just where we left Kate -- as the others walk off, follow Sawyer. Sayid then moves to Kate, who's pale now. And he says to her, sweetly:
65) 1) dialog: -- We should keep moving. And Kate nods -- and heads off --
68) 1) dialog: Also walking. He pulls out the transceiver as they go. Sawyer sees this.
68) 3) dialog: We're up higher.
68) 7) dialog: -- Bar -- bar, there's a bar-- (then, loud)
68) 9) dialog: -- Mayday mayday-- But: SCRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! HORRIBLE FEEDBACK!
68) 10) dialog: -- What's that? -- Feedback -- - Feedback from what? -- I don't know --
68) 13) dialog: No -- no, it's not broken... (suddenly) We can't transmit because something's already transmitting. This sinks in --
68) 15) dialog: Somewhere close -- the signal's strong --
68) 21) dialog: Could be a Satphone -- maybe a radio signal... TIGHT ON KATE as she finally asks the only question reall worth answering --
68) 23) dialog: I don't know what frequency the signal is -- hold on -- Sayid begins to SCAN for the frequency -- nothing but STA
68) 30) dialog: -- Does anyone speak French? MOVING over all their faces as the voice continues. No. None of them speak French. But then -- pointing:
68) 44) dialog: -- Nonono -- -- What? "Nonono" what? -- The batteries -- they're dying --
68) 48) dialog: How much time do we -- ? -- Not much --
68) 54) dialog: -- Yes, she's right -- It's a loop. "Iteration." It's repeating the same message. (and to prove it) It's a counter -- the next number will end five three three. And they HUSH, focused on the transceiver as --
68) 57) dialog: It's a running count. Of the number of times the message has repeated. It's roughly thirty seconds long, so... Sayid's eyes look skyward, lips moving -- runs the number
68) 69) dialog: Sixteen years.
68) 71) dialog: Sixteen years. Five months. And nine days. That's the count.
68) 73) dialog: The message. The iterations. It's a distress call. A mayday. A plea for help. And if the counter's right, it's been playing... over and over for sixteen years. (CONTINUED)
