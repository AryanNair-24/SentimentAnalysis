She's composed now, but stil coming down from the experience. After a beat, Boone sits closely beside her on the sand, facing her. Watches her paint her toenails. There's something clear here: there's enormous animosity between them. Regardless, he offers her a chocolate bar.

51) 0) text: WIDE SHOT. Spectacular view. Our SIX HIKERS (Kate, Sayid, Charlie, Shannon and Boone, with Sawyer at the front, hac away plants with a found stick) trudge through the jungle the base of the MOUNTAIN. The hike isn't any fun. Plus, it's HOT. Also, they're scared. Kate especially -- lookin around with concern as they walk. Afraid that, at any moment, that Thing might show up to end their lives. Now WE FAVOR Shannon and Charlie, who walks beside her:

68) 68) dialog: "Please help... I'm alone now... on the island alone. Someone please come... the others, they're dead. It killed them. (then) It killed them all." And with that, complete and utter SILENCE. The battery is dead. Just the wind. Then Shannon lowers the transceiver. We suddenly find SAYID. His lips stop moving. His eyes dr from the heavens. And he looks even more frightened than rest of them.
