72) 50) dialog: That's all right, honey. I know how you feel. (singing) Bein' born was the worst and the first Mistake I ever made The doctor didn't spank me He just slapped me in the face And the cup of love was always quenchin' Someone else's thirst Leaving me to swallow The bitter taste of hurt. ‘Cause I was raised an orphan Never wanted as a kid Until the year I turned thirteen Then everybody did — Strangers passed me back and forth Men just took me as they pleased And others had a Cinderella slave To cook and clean and weave. Though the deck is stacked against you Win or lose you have to play The hand that life has dealt you And it's a gamble either way. On a dusty road at fifteen In a yellow cotton dress With the desert sun like an angry dragon Breathin' down my neck And the dry cracked plains that made me think Of a prehistoric time Should I fear what lay before me Less than what I'd left behind. A fifteen year old girl don't have No trouble hitchin' rides But sometimes when you're ridin' free You'll pay the highest price On back roads, and in backseats And in cheap highway motels But what's a few more strangers In a life of nothin' else.
