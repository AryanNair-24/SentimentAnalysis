Rafe hangs inverted in his flight harness, the asphalt of the runway shooting past, ten feet beyond his head. He pushes the plane into a climb, his cockpit on the outs of the circle. The plane reaches the top of its arc, and almost stalls; but Rafe noses it over again, toward the earth, only this time he has very little altitude. The pl hurtles down, still with it belly on the inside of the curve... And makes it full circle. Rafe's head now is barely a foo off the asphalt as the plane shoots past, still inverted. THE OTHER PILOTS burst into cheers. RAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT permits himself a smile. He lands, and the guys run out to meet him...all except f the Training Captain, who stands there shaking his head.

His right han points...and his left hand points...in different directio His hands float around in the air until finally both of are indicating the same direction, behind his back. In th bunk beyond Coma's is another drunk pilot in a Hawaiian shirt...and to judge by the shapely bronzed leg that protrudes from under his damp sheet, there's a woman with too.

Danny looks out the window again and sees Evelyn's beauti form disappear around the corner, on her way back to the hospital. Danny moves back to the table, and as two burly Hawaiian waiters set another full loaded mai-tai volcano the center of the table, he picks up a glass and dips it of the potent liquid. He shouts to the whole room --
33) 12) dialog: I'm a better pilot than any son-of-a- bitch on this island! So I'm the one to say this! Here's to Rafe McCawley! A better pilot...and a better man...than me. The other pilots drink up -- from glasses or from straws.

52) 5) dialog: I taught him to drink beer. He taught me how to fly.

52) 8) dialog: Look, uh...Rafe's dad...he wrote me with the news, and it took me a couple of days to work up the guts to come here and tell you. I'm not as brave as Rafe, or as noble. But if there's anything I can ever do to help -- you let me know, okay? She stares into the distance. He stands and puts his hand top of hers, as much for his comfort as for hers.
52) 9) dialog: I understand why Rafe loved you. You're as strong as he was. Since she's still not looking at him, he starts to move a When he reaches the turn in the path, he looks back, and her figure in the gathering darkness.
