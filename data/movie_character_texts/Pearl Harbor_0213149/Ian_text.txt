The restaurant is barely more than a shelter of palm wood posts with a frond roof, and it looks out over the harbor Evelyn sits alone. She's brought writing paper. As the Hawaiian waiter serves her an icy tropical ambrosia with chunks of pineapple and a fresh plumeria flower floating the rim of the glass, she lifts her pen. But before she can start to write, three naval officers m over to her table from the bar. They're out of uniform to wearing garish tropical shirts.

The last man to enter the room and take his place is ADMI YAMAMOTO. Harvard educated, Yamamoto is an object of veneration and suspicion among the men of the war council Yamamoto bows, sits, and looks across the table at his fr Genda, who can't hide his fear. Yamamoto glances to the f end of the table where NISHIKURA, chief of the War Counci sits glowering. (Their discussion is in Japanese, with subtitles.)

It's full of booze -- or was; Danny and the other guys are pulling heartily at the straws, and they gurgle the last liquid is sucked dry.

Rafe is one of the pilots; the fuselage below his cockpit marked with four swastikas, symbols of his victories. He taxis to a stop, and is met by IAN, a Scottish mechanic, is dismayed at the state of the plane.

The lights from within the hospital, and the pristine whi beds beneath those lights, give the place a kind of glow, where Evelyn moves alone and beautiful, like a ballerina giant's jewel box. Now we see the shoulders of the figure, from behind, and tell that it is a man in uniform, but at first we can't t who. He's standing dead still, transfixed in watching Eve through the windows.

Every bed is already full; there are burn and broken people on the floor -- soldiers, sailors, civilians, firemen, all mixed in together. People are dyi everywhere, and screaming in pain, or moaning and begging help. At first we don't see Evelyn, and wonder if she survived the glass; then we see her, flecks of her own bl dotting her face and arms. The blood of soldiers on her surgical apron. A steel calm has replaced her earlier frenzy, even as the other nurses are breaking down.

Blood, body parts, debris everywhere, and all of i made more hellish by the oil fires on the water and the choking black smoke those fires produce. Every survivor has become an emergency fireman, stretcher bearer, medic, iron worker. They fish men from the water, extract them from the tangled wreckage of the ships. Everyone is screaming and yelling -- the wounded for help the helpers for more help. Local firemen and civilians battle heroically too; the wa mains are ruptured, so they put pump water from the base swimming pool toward the burning ships. The PHOTOGRAPHER records this with his black-and-white f camera. He is shaken, and yet he understands the magnitud of what he is recording -- the loss of America's innocenc
