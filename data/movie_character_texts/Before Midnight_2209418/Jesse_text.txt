8) 18) dialog: What's that?
10) 1) dialog: All right, well, the whole time I've been here, I've been working on this idea about a group of different people with all these brain abnormalities. So the book would be like a day in their life from all their unique points of view, right? Like there's this older lady who has a condition that makes you feel like you're ina perpetual state of déja vu. Every single experience she has, she feels like she's had it before. I mean she can be sitting here with us, talking seemingly functional right? And in her head, she's thinking: Didn't he already say that? I mean; weren't we here yesterday having this exact same conversation.
10) 3) dialog: Yeah, except all the time.

10) 7) dialog: Yeah. It's called persistent deja... It's real but I can't pronounce it. The men chuckle.
10) 8) dialog: Then there's these two other characters with facial recognition extremes. Like there's this one guy and he can't recognize his wife of twenty years. He looks at himself in the mirror and he feels this disconnect with that man he's looking at. Then the other character is the opposite, middle-aged housewife with a categorical exacting memory of every face she's ever seen; so she lives in a big city but to her, it's a small town. Like, a taxi drives past and she thinks 'Oh, that's the driver who dropped me off at Place de Vosges three Christmases ago.' And some old lady walking on the street, she thinks; 'Oh, she sat two seats down from me on the Metro last year.' So, everyone she meets,to her feels intimate and connected.
10) 10) dialog: Oh, Achilles! Anna! Hey, you guys.
10) 14) dialog: No, it's not just three characters, it's a whole group of people. It's like, I'm working on a chapter right now about a young Greek man named Achilles.
10) 16) dialog: Well, he's named after you. And this guy is caught in a loop where all he sees is the transient nature of everything, right? Like he looks out to sea and thinks of the day it's gonna be dry and littered with fossils.
10) 18) dialog: Ah, no-no-no. It won't be pretentious, I promise. No, it's gonna be funny. Really funny. He picks up a book and he immediately wonders: Who's gonna be the last person to read this?
10) 22) dialog: Well, not so much death, right? It's just like transformation, you know. Like he's seeing too far into the future.
10) 25) dialog: That'll work.
10) 27) dialog: It's not time that they're lost in, right? It's like perception. That's the deal. No, I'm thinking of setting the whole novel at a movie. Like, every character in some way comes in contact with the film 'On the Waterfront.' (to Achilles) Have you seen "On the Waterfront"? He's not sure until Stefanos tells him the Greek title.
10) 29) dialog: Yeah.
10) 31) dialog: Yeah, yeah. Okay, well, the first chapter of the book is opening weekend, Times Square, 1954. That old lady, with perpetual deja vu walks into the matinee screening, right? Except the whole time she's thinking: haven't I already seen this?
10) 33) dialog: Right. And then another chapter is a 1979 Paris film studies class. Then we have a Kazan retrospective in Munich, 1993.
10) 35) dialog: Yeah, it's time but, it's more perception. You don't like it.
10) 38) dialog: Will do.
13) 0) text: Jesse leads the kids down the rock steps to the little pa of rocky beach under Patrick's house.

14) 1) dialog: All right, I don't want to let this meal go by without saying thank you to everyone. And especially you, Patrick. We had no idea what we were getting into these last six weeks. A letter arrives from the university, inviting us to the Southern Peloponnese of Greece, to the guest house of a great writer? ‘Sure, why not?' And then at the airport earlier today, Hank turns to me and he says this has been the greatest summer of his life.
14) 3) dialog: And I have to say the same. So, thank you Patrick, and not just for what you have done for me and my family but for all the ways you've given back, all right. So, to Patrick!
14) 13) dialog: I know. I shouldn't have thrown those cherries-
14) 15) dialog: It was my fault.

14) 60) dialog: You know, I think I'm probably gonna feel about the same way as Kasparov - you remember how all those chess players felt when they could no longer compete with that big-ass computer -
14) 62) dialog: Right, right, right! Remember at first nobody thought a computer could ever beat our best.
14) 64) dialog: (Accent) A machine lacks that ineffable human instinct.
14) 66) dialog: And now we can't even compete.
14) 72) dialog: Okay. All right, I have a question for you Patrick. I think a lot of people are feeling that way. You know, that we're this kind of pleasure obsessed, porn-addled materialists, ceding our humanity to technology... At the same moment that computers are becoming sentient, right? So what my question is: what is this notion of self to begin with?
14) 74) dialog: Yeah, but we're kind of 99% automated already. Our personality - or this thing we think of as ourself right - it's just a tiny fraction of what the brain is doing, right?
14) 76) dialog: Most of it's just automated body function.
14) 78) dialog: So then what is it we're actually ceding?
14) 80) dialog: Yes.
14) 94) dialog: Thank you. We met about 18 years ago. We kinda, sort of, fell in love a little bit, and then we lost track of each other and a decade later we ran into each other.
14) 96) dialog: We didn't?
14) 98) dialog: Yeah, yeah...
14) 101) dialog: It was really romantic.

14) 202) dialog: No, I'm just trying to say it's like being pissed at a frog for being green.
14) 207) dialog: (to Anna and Achilles) Okay, but are your parents still together?
14) 209) dialog: No. And what about you?

15) 17) dialog: When I was younger I just wanted time to speed up. You know?

15) 21) dialog: I just wanted to close my eyes and wake up and be an adult. And then I kind of feel like that all happened and I just want everything to slow down.
15) 23) dialog: I know, you've always thought that. And me too, it's like, is this really my life? Like, is it happening right now?
15) 25) dialog: I know. Celine and Jesse laugh.

15) 30) dialog: I know, it's true. I just wish it was a little easier.
15) 32) dialog: Well, just to maintain a certain level of passion, you know? I mean it used to come so naturally. I remember when I was younger, me and all my writer friends, we just felt like we were doing something important, you know? Like this was our time.
15) 34) dialog: No, we -
15) 36) dialog: All right, maybe. I don't know, it just grew out of all this energy you know, this creativity or whatever ambitions people had. You know, I think you gotta be a little deluded to stay motivated.

20) 244) dialog: If you're asking me if I'm committed to you, the girls, and the life we've built together, the answer is a resounding YES.
20) 246) dialog: Do I ever ask you about the time you went to go visit your old boyfriend after his mother died? No. You want to know why? Because I KNOW the way that your fucking French ass works, and I guarantee that you at least blew that guy, but I also know that you love me, okay? I'm okay with you being a complicated human being! I don't wanna live a boring life where two people own each other, where two people are institutionalized in a box that others created - because that is a bunch of stifling bullshit. Petrified, she exits. Jesse sits alone waiting for her to return. Enter Celine. She walks in, sets her room key down.
21) 0) text: Jesse finds Celine sitting near the same table where they saw the sunset earlier.
21) 1) dialog: Miss?
21) 3) dialog: Are you by yourself? Are you waiting for somebody?
21) 5) dialog: Oh. Well, just my type. Jesse sits down right across from her. Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 108.
21) 7) dialog: Yeah, listen. I've just been checking you out from across the cafe and I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but you're by far the best looking woman in this place.
21) 9) dialog: I'd love to buy you a drink, maybe talk to you, get to know you a little bit... you know. Are you here on business? Nothing.
21) 10) dialog: Ok.. You have a boyfriend?
21) 12) dialog: Sorry to hear that. God, you want to talk about it?
21) 14) dialog: But that's the thing, I'm not a stranger. No, we've met before... summer '94.
21) 16) dialog: No, we even fell in love.
21) 18) dialog: That's me. I'm that guy. Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 109.
21) 20) dialog: Well, see, I know something about tonight that you don't know.
21) 22) dialog: Something important. See, I know because I've actually already lived through this night.
21) 24) dialog: I'm a time traveler.
21) 26) dialog: I have a time machine up in my room. I've come to save you just like I said I would.
21) 28) dialog: Save you from being blinded by all the little bullshit of life.
21) 30) dialog: I assure you, that guy you vaguely remember, the sweet romantic one who you met on a train? That is me.
21) 32) dialog: Yeah.
21) 34) dialog: What can I say? I mean, it's tough out there in time and space. You, on the other hand are even more beautiful than I remember.
21) 36) dialog: I'm not trying to pick you up - no, no, you misunderstood me. I'm only here as a messenger. I've just traveled all the way from the future. I was just with your 82 year old self who gave me a letter to read to you. So here I am.
21) 38) dialog: 
21) 41) dialog: Nice. Really nice.
21) 43) dialog: Let's just say, there's even more of you to love. Okay, do you want me to read the letter to you?
21) 45) dialog: Oh sure, I mean, if you're not interested in what you have to say...
21) 47) dialog: Okay, here I go. Dear Celine, I'm writing to you from the other side of the woods. This letter is lighting a candle...
21) 49) dialog: May I please continue?
21) 51) dialog: I am sending you this young man. Yes, young - and he will be your escort. God knows, he has many problems and has struggled his whole life connecting and being present even with those he loves the most. And for that he is deeply sorry - but you are his only hope. Celine, my advice to you is this: you are entering the best years of your life. Looking back from where I sit now these middle years are only a little bit more difficult then when you were 12 and Mathieu and Vanessa danced all night to the Bee Gee's "How deep is your love." Celine, you will be fine. Your girls will grow up to become examples and icons of feminism.
21) 53) dialog: Yeah, well, you know what I just noticed, there's a Post Script at the bottom, looks kind of important. Maybe I should just skip over the rest of this boring stuff and get to that?
21) 55) dialog: Okay. You sure? Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 112.
21) 57) dialog: Okay, all right, well.
21) 59) dialog: Yeah. Okay. (looks around, lowers his voice) Yeah, it's like financial tips, horoscopes, boring stuff. Okay, here it is... P.S. By the way, the best sex of my life happened one night in the Southern Peloponnese. Don't miss it. My whole sexual being went to a new, ground-breaking level.
21) 61) dialog: Yeah, I don't know what that means.
21) 63) dialog: Yes, I heard you - that you don't love me anymore. I figured you didn't mean it but if you did, then fuck it. You know something? You're just like the little girls and everybody else - you want to live in some fairy tale. I'm just trying to make things better here. I tell you I love you unconditionally, I tell you that you're beautiful, I tell you that your ass looks great when you're 80. I'm trying to make you laugh. I put up with plenty of your shit, and if you think I'm just some dog who's gonna keep coming back then, you're wrong. But if you want true love - this is it. (MORE )
21) 65) dialog: This is real life. It's not perfect, but it's real. And if you can't see it, then you're blind, alright? I give up. Jesse crumples up the napkin/letter he was reading from a tosses it on the table. What follows is a lengthy silent sequence where they just sort of stare at each other, seemingly going through everything past and present.
21) 67) dialog: What do you mean?
21) 69) dialog: Well... it's complicated.
21) 71) dialog: Yeah, actually. Yeah, it's been a real issue, you know, clothes don't travel well through the whole space- time continuum.
21) 73) dialog: Oh, Jesus.
21) 75) dialog: Continuum.
21) 77) dialog: Yeah. Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 114.
21) 79) dialog: You know, there's something I have been thinking about, about your letter. You mention something about the southern Peloponesse? We're in the southern Peloponesse.
21) 81) dialog: Do you think it could be tonight that you're still talking about in your 80s?
