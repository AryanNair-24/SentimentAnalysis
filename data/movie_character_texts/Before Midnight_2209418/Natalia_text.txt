14) 248) dialog: Well, when I think of Elias, what I miss the most about him is the way he used to lie down next to me at night. Sometimes his arm would stretch along my chest. I couldn't move, I even held my breath, but I felt safe... complete. I miss the way he was whistling walking down the street. Every time I do something, I think of what he would say: "Well its cold today, wear a scarf." But lately I've been forgetting little things. He's sort of fading and I'm starting to forget him and it's like losing him again. (MORE )
14) 250) dialog: Sometimes, I make myself remember every detail of his face - the exact color of his eyes, his lips, his teeth, the texture of his skin, his hair - that was all gone by the time he went. And sometimes, not always, but sometimes I can actually see him. It is as if a cloud moves away and there he is. I could almost touch him, but then the real world rushes in, and he vanishes again. For a while, I did this every morning, when the sun was not too bright outside because the sun somehow makes him vanish. He appears and he disappears like a sunrise or sunset, anything so ephemeral. Just like our life - we appear and we disappear and we are so important to some, but, we are just passing through.
