8) 6) dialog: Well, it must be a little weird for Celine, man, the way she's in a book like that, no?
8) 8) dialog: But the second one is sexy, man. When he misses the plane and they black out the windows and they have sex for days and days and days like there's no tomorrow. I mean wow, did you guys actually do that? Jesse shrugs his shoulders.
8) 9) dialog: You did that, uh?
8) 12) dialog: No, the third one I didn't read. I mean, my wife gave it to me but it's just a little bit too long for me, man. Even the title is long. What's the title?

10) 21) dialog: Well, okay, so he doesn't get excited about tits, cars, booze, nothing. He just thinks about death.

14) 48) dialog: When you guys Skype, do you, you know, do you go a little crazy?
14) 50) dialog: No, I'm not being vulgar. I'm just being an amateur anthropologist who is interested in virtual words, on a theoretical level.
14) 52) dialog: Yeah. For instance, the sex of the near future, okay, and I'm not making this up but, it's gonna be just like plugging in, attaching something to your genitals - I'm sorry - and then you'll be having virtual intercourse with anyone of your choice. You will be able to program in all your preferences. You'll be able to type in exactly what you want Marilyn Monroe to whisper in your ear.
