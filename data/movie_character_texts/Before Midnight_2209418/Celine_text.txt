2) 33) dialog: Okay, I should have taken this job a year ago. You know, and I was scared because of the amount of work, but I think it's the best opportunity ever and it's more money and... I'm doing it.
2) 35) dialog: No, I'm not sure of anything, okay?
2) 37) dialog: I mean, you know, what's gonna happen to everyone if I leave? Like Francoise, and I mean, they count on me. What do you think? Should I take it or not, should... Should I?
2) 39) dialog: No! It's not just that, okay? It's been stirring in me all summer...
2) 41) dialog: ..-And I should do it. And I'm doing it!
2) 43) dialog: I'm doing it, all right? Oh, god. I wish things were simpler. I mean, if I leave I get fucked, if I stay I get fucked...

2) 57) dialog: Okay. Well. It's all brown.
2) 59) dialog: Ella - this is evidence of your father stealing food from you. If you become bulimic or anorexic, it is not my fault. Don't blame it all on your mother, okay?

2) 63) dialog: God. I love your mom. You're always so hard on her.
2) 65) dialog: The "fucked up years." That reminds me, talking about fucked up... did I ever tell you the story of my little Cleopatra kitty? No? Okay, I think you would remember if I did. When I was a little girl I had this cat named Cleopatra and every spring she would jump the fence and get pregnant and always end up with a litter of exactly two kittens.
2) 67) dialog: Two kitties. Every time, every year, two cats. I mean it was just... amazing. Then one day, I was around 30 and I was having lunch with my Dad, I was remembering, mentioning little Cleopatra and he was like - ‘the hardest thing I ever had to do was to kill those cute little kittens'- and I was like WHAT? It turns out-- listen to this--there were sometimes up to 7 kittens in that litter--
2) 69) dialog: But he would take five of them--
2) 71) dialog: --Put them into a plastic bag with a bunch of ether.

2) 103) dialog: I mean, I wouldn't worry too much about him. We spoke a bunch, and you know what his main concerns in life are?
2) 105) dialog: Pimples and how girls perceive him. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree, I guess.

2) 151) dialog: Okay. Fine. Like I'm the first woman you ever fell in love with?
2) 153) dialog: I don't think so.
2) 155) dialog: (beat) No, of course not.
2) 157) dialog: No! (laughs) Jesse, stop this. It's dumb.
2) 159) dialog: No? Okay. How old are you? Come on!
2) 161) dialog: You are so, so working on our little night, aren't you?
2) 163) dialog: I'm stuck with an American teenager. Can't believe it. Do we have to do all that stuff later?
2) 165) dialog: No, no, no, but I meant the hotel, later. I just, I'm not sure I want to go - Her phone rings. She picks it up.
2) 166) dialog: (into phone) Hi, sweetie. Yeah. Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. Well, well, it's fine. It's fine! Call me from London. Have a good flight. Bye. Jesse gestures for the phone, but she's already hung up.

2) 170) dialog: Why?
2) 172) dialog: I know. It makes me ill every time.
2) 174) dialog: I know. It's like we're sending him back across enemy lines.
2) 176) dialog: Well, maybe that's the good news. We only have four more years of this.
2) 178) dialog: No. What do you mean?
2) 180) dialog: Yeah, you're right! Maybe it's time. I mean... I really think it's time. (MORE )
2) 182) dialog: Just tell his mum all this and ask if he can come and live with us. He'd love it, we can put him in that bilingual -

2) 186) dialog: Should I call his mother?
2) 188) dialog: No, I know.
2) 190) dialog: Who cares?
2) 192) dialog: That's not your fault.
2) 194) dialog: Okay, he just doesn't like baseball does he? Who can blame him.
2) 196) dialog: Jesse, I'm not moving to Chicago.
2) 199) dialog: Well... listen, you're a wonderful father. He loves the relationship you have, he loves the letters you send him and he -
2) 201) dialog: No, of course he reads them; he just doesn't compliment the writing the way you want.
2) 203) dialog: Oh, my god.
2) 205) dialog: This is where it ends.
2) 207) dialog: This is how people start breaking up.

2) 214) dialog: It has a timer. Well, you know what? It's ticking. Right now. And this is how it happens.
2) 216) dialog: You're unhappy, you blame it on the other person, resentment grows, everything slowly rots and you break up. That's it.
2) 218) dialog: Not at all. Not at all!
2) 220) dialog: No-no-no-no. I'm actually surprised we lasted this long.
2) 222) dialog: We were on parallel tracks for a while but now our tracks have crossed and I'm going west and you're going east. And believe me, this is how it happens. I've seen it, okay? Catherine Alexander -
2) 224) dialog: Well, no! I'm kidding. And I'm not. All right? (beat) Just - this is it. As Celine talks, the girls wake up. One of the girls, ELL groggily says:

14) 41) dialog: How did you keep in touch?
14) 44) dialog: Ah, that's the new romance!
14) 54) dialog: Oh, I might like that.
14) 67) dialog: I saw this documentary where they were doing an experiment on a lab rat and he was wired up and he could push a switch and have an orgasm.
14) 69) dialog: And so scientists were sort of laughing at this pathetic little creature while it ignored its food and water and didn't do anything else, and eventually it just died. I mean, I think that's the future of humanity. You know, just (Demonstrates Rat Dying) .+.. And die.

14) 91) dialog: Oh, excuse me, Stefanos.
14) 95) dialog: No, no, no, we didn't run into each other, sweetie-pie.

14) 99) dialog: And I read about it and went to look for it.
14) 102) dialog: Not really. Not really. He neglects to mention he was married, had a kid...
14) 104) dialog: Yeah, that part was a disaster.
14) 106) dialog: Yeah. Okay. And the first time we have sex without a condom, twins!

14) 118) dialog: --. And at the last minute I let the ball go down the middle. It builds their confidence.
14) 120) dialog: If I didn't let him win at every game... we would never have sex. (MORE )
14) 122) dialog: I mean, I'm sorry to say it, but he's actually a closet macho. He dreams of having a bimbo for a wife.
14) 124) dialog: Dreams!
14) 127) dialog: (Baby voice) So...
14) 131) dialog: So you're a writer?
14) 133) dialog: So you write like... books?
14) 136) dialog: Wow. I've never met a writer before.
14) 138) dialog: You must be really smart.
14) 140) dialog: You know, I can't even write my own name sometimes when I'm tired.
14) 142) dialog: Well, I like stories with a meaning behind them, like a really beautiful love story...
14) 144) dialog: You know, I read this book once, "Romeo and..."
14) 146) dialog: Yeah!

14) 150) dialog: Oh, I thought it was a book based on the movie.
14) 153) dialog: Okay, it was a play. Wow. Well, actually I didn't read the whole thing because you know, sometimes I have to keep up and read those Magazines to know exactly what is going on in all those people's lives.
14) 155) dialog: Okay. Well, you're very, very smart and (whispering) I bet you have a gigantic penis.
14) 157) dialog: Yes, he is - calm down!
14) 160) dialog: And that's the funny part of it! The not-so-funny part of the closet macho, okay -- is that today, after we drop Henry off, he tells me that even though I have an offer for an amazing job, he wants me to throw it all away and move to Chicago.

15) 10) dialog: Remember that letter that you let me read that you wrote when you were twenty, to yourself at forty?
15) 12) dialog: No, I didn't even remember that part. I meant all the other things in that letter...you were the same guy.
15) 14) dialog: I mean, we always think we're evolving, but maybe we can't change that much.
15) 16) dialog: How?
15) 18) dialog: Why?
15) 22) dialog: Hm... it's strange - I've always had this feeling, no matter where I am in my life, that it's either a memory or a dream.
15) 24) dialog: It is.
15) 27) dialog: That's what I keep telling you. You know nothing!

15) 37) dialog: Young men have this thing about comparing themselves all the time. They have all these signposts they judge themselves by. You used to do that all the time.
15) 39) dialog: With like: Rimbaud read this by seventeen, F. Scott Fitzgerald did this by thirty...
15) 41) dialog: Yeah. But women don't think that way as much.
15) 43) dialog: No. We have much less to compare ourselves to maybe. Most women who achieve anything in life, the first time you hear about them, they're in their 50's, because it was so hard for them to get any recognition before then. They struggle for 30 years or they raise kids and were stranded at home before they could finally do what they want. Actually, you know what? It's kind of freeing. We don't have to spend our lives comparing ourselves to Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Tolstoy...

15) 98) dialog: Stop it, that's disgusting! Billy goat. No, the truth is, you failed the test. And the fact is, you would not pick me up on a train. You wouldn't even notice me, a fat-assed middle-aged mom, losing her hair.

16) 33) dialog: I bet she knowingly got a couple of answers wrong just to make sure he didn't feel threatened.
16) 35) dialog: Yeah, obviously like you-know-who.
16) 37) dialog: Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.
16) 39) dialog: No, it's not funny at all.
16) 43) dialog: He's next, then you.
16) 45) dialog: Your grandfather didn't have a funeral?
16) 47) dialog: Oh, yeah. I kind of like the idea of you attending mine.
16) 49) dialog: Imagining you in a suit, clean shaven for once... and holding hands with the girls... I don't know, I like it.
16) 51) dialog: Well, I'll see. I guess one of us will see.
16) 53) dialog: To Texas?
16) 55) dialog: How bad do you want me there? I mean I would come but it's really expensive with the flights...
16) 57) dialog: (To Barking Dog) Oh, hello.
16) 59) dialog: Well you know, if I'm not there it'll be easier for you to fuck your cousins.
16) 61) dialog: Yeah. Isn't that common where you come from? I mean... you didn't answer the question.
16) 63) dialog: Will you be able to put up with me for another 56 more years?
16) 65) dialog: Shit, you're really working it.
16) 67) dialog: Uh-oh, my hairy Spanish lover is back.
16) 69) dialog: (a beat) Oh! Look at this! Wow. This place sort of reminds me of this film I saw when I was a teenager. It was a black and white film from the 50s. I remember a couple walking through the ruins of Pompeii, looking at bodies that had been lying there for centuries. I remember the bodies caught in their sleep, still lovingly holding each other. I don't know why, sometimes I have this image in my mind when, you know, we're asleep and you hold me.
16) 71) dialog: Yeah! (Laughing)
16) 73) dialog: (Laughing) Well... I don't know, it's not horrible. They had some bodies with little kids sleeping between them...
16) 75) dialog: Yeah! I guess I was young and a bit morbid - I mean at that age you romanticize the idea of dying with the person you love.
16) 77) dialog: Maybe, if it were, you know, our first night together, then, a long time ago. But now, no. I'd like to live! Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 73.
16) 79) dialog: Oh, no! Putain de merde, I blew it. Okay, if we're both 98 you can ask me again, but anytime sooner...Ehhnt! (Whispers) Sorry. They are walking by an old, tiny Chapel.
16) 81) dialog: Can we go in?
16) 83) dialog: Oh, wow! They enter.
17) 2) dialog: I'm sure it works. He is looking at the old faded paintings on the walls.
17) 4) dialog: All the eyes are scratched out. Is that about the blindness?
17) 6) dialog: That's it! I'm never eating Turkish food again.
17) 8) dialog: Okay fine, then I'll never suck another Turkish cock.
17) 10) dialog: Oh, that's terrible. No, I forgot you're a closet Christian. Is it really bad to make blow-job jokes in a church? Jesse just shrugs.
17) 12) dialog: (a beat) The girls asked me again what our wedding was like.
17) 14) dialog: I said it was very low key.
17) 16) dialog: Very Quaker. (MORE )
17) 18) dialog: I don't know why they want us to be married so badly. It's important to them.
17) 20) dialog: No.
17) 22) dialog: It's just all those fairy tales they like so much, you know? Remember when they were little, at the end of every cartoon they watched, they'd be all "Oh they're getting married!" Even if it's Pinocchio and his dad, or Donald Duck and his nephews.
17) 24) dialog: So if we're going to spend another fifty-six more years together...
17) 26) dialog: «+. What about me would you like to change?
17) 28) dialog: What do you mean? There's not one thing you'd like to change about me? I'm perfect?
17) 30) dialog: Okay. Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 76.
17) 32) dialog: One thing.
17) 34) dialog: Uh-huh.
17) 36) dialog: You're a very skilled manipulator, you know that?
17) 38) dialog: You think?
17) 40) dialog: I don't think you do, actually. (Laughs)
17) 42) dialog: I mean right now?
17) 44) dialog: This is great. You know?
17) 46) dialog: I feel close to you.
17) 48) dialog: But sometimes, I don't know, I feel like you're breathing helium and I'm breathing oxygen.
17) 50) dialog: See? I'm trying to truly connect -
17) 52) dialog: - And you make a joke! That's exactly what I'm talking about!
17) 54) dialog: Yeah. Do you remember this friend of mine? George, from New York.
17) 56) dialog: Oh, no, that was before. That was before.
17) 58) dialog: He was this friend of mine that, when he found out he had leukemia, and he was probably going to die, he confessed to me that the first thing that came to his mind was relief. Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 78.
17) 60) dialog: Well, before he found out he had nine months to live he was always so worried about money, and now his thought was, great! I have more than enough money to live for the next nine months, I've made it!
17) 62) dialog: And then he was finally able to enjoy everything about life, even like being stuck in traffic. He would just enjoy looking at people... staring at their faces. Just little things.
17) 64) dialog: What do you mean?
17) 66) dialog: No, he died. A long time ago.
17) 68) dialog: "The Rovers"?
17) 70) dialog: Okay. Is that a real book?
17) 72) dialog: No?
17) 74) dialog: Okay.
17) 76) dialog: I love that you read books in your dreams.
17) 78) dialog: I have major action hero dreams, like I'm flying around like a superhero, breaking through walls. And at the end, I have an orgasm.
18) 1) dialog: Still there. Still there. ... Still there. Still there. ... Gone. They sit in silence. Eventually, Jesse looks over at Celi and notices she's moved. He just takes her hand. The sun is now gone.
19) 4) dialog: Incidentals.
19) 21) dialog: Me?
19) 23) dialog: Madeline? Not really. People assume it's me but it's - it's not me at all. He's got a big imagination.
19) 25) dialog: I can't sign a book I didn't write. It doesn't make - Jesse passes the books to Celine.
19) 28) dialog: I'm happy to. She begins to sign. Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 82.
19) 30) dialog: Okay. Thank you.
20) 0) text: Celine and Jesse enter the room.
20) 2) dialog: Wow, this is nice!
20) 4) dialog: Clean... air conditioning... I love it! Oh my god.
20) 6) dialog: Wow, oh wow, that bath tub. Jesse goes over to the table to examine what's on it.
20) 8) dialog: They are so nice, we have to get them a present before we leave.
20) 10) dialog: Yeah, I know. For sure. Wow. I miss the girls. Jesse seductively touches her.
20) 12) dialog: This is such a nice view. Look.
20) 14) dialog: What?
20) 17) dialog: (touches his chin) It's funny. I never noticed until today but... all the red in your beard is gone. It used to be one of the things that made me fall for you, it's crazy.
20) 19) dialog: No, but you know, I see the red in our girls' eyelashes. I look at them and it makes me think of when we met.
20) 21) dialog: Yeah? What?
20) 23) dialog: After? Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 84.
20) 25) dialog: What?
20) 27) dialog: You mean without Nina and Ella jumping on our heads.
20) 29) dialog: Think?
20) 31) dialog: When you said you could hear me think, I really thought you could. But it was just my eyelids. How dumb and romantic of me.
20) 33) dialog: I miss thinking, too. No more thinking in the morning, no more morning sex.
20) 35) dialog: I'm looking forward to it so much, I don't think I will sleep.
20) 37) dialog: Okay, then stop talking, so we can fuck. Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 85. They kiss until Celine's cell phone rings.
20) 38) dialog: (Laughs) Oh, shit, who is it?
20) 40) dialog: I said they could call in case of emergency only. Hope the girls are okay. Okay. Oh, it's Henry. Okay. Celine picks up.
20) 41) dialog: Hi sweetie - are you okay? Are you in London? Oh! Oh, already? (listens) Oh, no, we found it. Uh, we'll mail it tomorrow morning. (listens) Yeah. Ohh, they miss you, too. I'll kiss them for you. Okay, I'll tell him. Good luck with your mom - I love you too. Bye. Celine hangs up. Jesse gestures for the phone are again ignored.
20) 42) dialog: He's fine. He says he'll call you from Chicago when he lands.
20) 44) dialog: Well, he didn't have time to talk - he said they were boarding.
20) 46) dialog: His science project. But we'll mail it tomorrow. It'll be fine.
20) 48) dialog: What? What did I say?
20) 50) dialog: I didn't mean anything by it.
20) 52) dialog: Oh, like you think he forgets?
20) 54) dialog: That's so American to just sweep it under the carpet and act as if it didn't happen.
20) 56) dialog: It means nothing.
20) 58) dialog: Alright, I even made a joke the other day that his mom and I should try to settle it in one big mud wrestling contest.
20) 60) dialog: And he laughed. He might have more of a sense of humor than you do. Come on.
20) 62) dialog: Well, I didn't say anything bad about his mom. I made a joke; it's as much on me as it is on her.
20) 64) dialog: I think he's old enough now. I mean, he knows how bad it is between his mother and I.
20) 66) dialog: And I didn't do anything, it's all coming from her towards me. Okay, she hates me; yes, I fucked her husband a long time ago. Or should I say, he fucked me?
20) 68) dialog: Making a joke about the fact that his mom and I don't love each other is not the issue. That's not going to traumatize him. That already happened, alright, and now you're trying to transfer your guilt and blame me?
20) 70) dialog: You know, on the contrary, if he can make a joke about it, maybe he'll be able to live with it better. That's what I think.
20) 72) dialog: It's nobody's fault if his mom is a drunk and abusive psychologically.
20) 74) dialog: I mean, it makes me sick that he has to be with her, but I guess judges assume that women have the mother instinct. She has the mother instinct of Medea! Jesse goes to the bathroom and washes off his face.
20) 76) dialog: Yeah, after all, it is a Greek myth.
20) 78) dialog: A woman killing her kids to punish her ex-husband? That's basically what she's doing, she's hurting him to get to you.
20) 80) dialog: Okay, stop blaming me for everything that is wrong in this whole thing with your wife, okay?
20) 82) dialog: Okay, you should have dealt with it a little better back then. She wouldn't have hated us so much.
20) 84) dialog: And now you're putting this shit on me about Henry?
20) 86) dialog: Let me tell you what I'm talking about: the moving to Chicago and giving up of my life. Now that you mention that Henry needs you, how do you think that makes me feel? I'm miserable! Alright? How can I take that job now? Tell me!
20) 88) dialog: Tell me. I'11 feel too guilty! No- no-no-no-no!
20) 90) dialog: It is in the nature of women to be the nurturah.
20) 92) dialog: Nur-tchur-yer.
20) 94) dialog: Okay, I can't even say that fucking word! I just naturally feel bad about everything. And you give me that look, like it's my fault.
20) 96) dialog: That look, the I-forgot-to-put-in- the-bag-the-science-project-look. I know you blame me.
20) 98) dialog: No. You didn't say anything. You didn't have to. Yeah, yeah, it's always my fault.
20) 100) dialog: I read on the fridge at work - you know those magnet words that people make sentences with? Someone had put together, "Women explore for eternity in the vast garden of sacrifice."
20) 102) dialog: Yeah. That line is so damn true and it's been for ten thousand years. But that's enough! Okay. I don't want to be one of these women. Like marriage is important to gays or contraception to women rights - it's the same with giving up my hopes, with the millions of women that have had to give up their hopes. I am not going to do it. This is bigger than me. This means more than me. Jesse bursts into applause. Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 91.
20) 104) dialog: It is.
20) 106) dialog: You're an asshole. You know what sweetie, when are we moving to Chicago? I want to make sure we are able to find a nice house and I can sew the drapes and pick matching bed covers.
20) 108) dialog: Well, you started it.
20) 110) dialog: Here we go. Unemotional, rational. You always play the part of the one and only rational one and I'm the irrational, hysterical, hormone-crazy one because I have emotions. Yeah, you sit back and you speak from your big perspective which means everything you say is level-headed and true. Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 92.
20) 112) dialog: The world is fucked by unemotional rational men deciding shit, alright? Politicians going to war for no reason, corporate heads deciding to wreck the environment, Cheney, Rumsfeld - very rational men.
20) 114) dialog: The final solution? Very rational thinking behind it.
20) 116) dialog: Here we go... Jesse gets up from the bed, puts his pants back on, and j Celine on the couch.
20) 118) dialog: Yes! I think it'd be better if he lived with us...
20) 120) dialog: .+. And I think his mom is a fucking alcoholic, hateful cunt that used the time that we were in Paris and I was giving birth and almost dying to (MORE )
20) 122) dialog: legally move Henry out of New York. Fuck her.
20) 124) dialog: Comparable job? Are you kidding?
20) 126) dialog: Why am I the one that always has to make the compromises?
20) 128) dialog: Well, moving to Chicago is pretty fucking dramatic to me.
20) 130) dialog: Okay, two seconds.
20) 132) dialog: You always get like this when you drop him off. You're sad, so you start a fight. He's fine. He's a great kid. Okay? But the truth is, he doesn't need you the way he used to. You missed the opportunity to be with him everyday of his childhood, you just did. And you can cry about it but he's growing up. You're a great father in other ways. You got divorced, like millions of other people. Was it ideal? No. Listen, if in one month, you still want me to quit my job and give up everything I have ben working towards all these years, just ask me. But right now I feel the same way I always have. I would move back to the US if that diseased ex-wife of yours would give us joint custody. But every other weekend amounts to shit Jesse, that's less than thirty days a semester and I don't think it's worth it for us to change our entire lives over that kind of time.
20) 134) dialog: Right, right? See? I'm being the rational one.
20) 136) dialog: We all get dragged through our parents' lives. If it wasn't me, your marriage would have ended over something else and you know that.
20) 138) dialog: Or even worse, he would have been raised by two miserable parents. Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 95.
20) 140) dialog: You mean you fucked up by moving to Paris to be with me?
20) 142) dialog: I knew that was going to cost too much.
20) 144) dialog: I told you not to do it.
20) 146) dialog: I moved to New York with you for two years and gave up everything, but I needed to be home to give birth to the twins because it was a complicated birth and I wanted to be with my mother. And you wanted it too!
20) 148) dialog: Okay. That's the one thing I asked from you, the one thing. And now you're going to blame me forever.
20) 150) dialog: ‘As a family?' Or what?
20) 152) dialog: I feel a passive aggressive threat in everything you say. Either do this, or I will resent you for the rest of our lives. Silence.
20) 153) dialog: No? Am I Right? You know what? I'm sensing something... I think the problem is that you don't want me to have a more substantial job. On some level, you feel threatened by my achieving anything that could diminish your status in our relationship.
20) 155) dialog: Now I don't think it's any coincidence that you feel that way at the same time that I have a truly exciting job opportunity.
20) 157) dialog: I have a question for you. If we didn't have the girls, all our crap. Would we even still be together?
20) 159) dialog: You know what I think? I think you need to move to Chicago. I think Henry needs you and I think I need to stay in Paris with the girls and take this job.
20) 163) dialog: Jesse, you're unhappy with me. You're blaming me for taking you away from your son.
20) 165) dialog: Listen, Jesse. We've just spent the last six weeks here and it's been great. You've been able to write everyday and the weather's been nice. But I didn't want to come to Greece originally.
20) 167) dialog: All right? There could be a revolution any second...
20) 169) dialog: People eat a lot of feta and olive oil, they act all happy but they actually talk about how "angry" they are... and it confuses me and I don't know what's going to happen in the next few weeks.
20) 171) dialog: Alright. You know what? I have had absolutely zero time for myself, I have ten thousand emails I have to answer that I didn't answer...
20) 173) dialog: I spend all day making dinner, wiping both you and your son's pee off the toilet seat, while you talk to your fellow novelists. Blah, blah, blah, you're a genius, blah, blah, blah, no, you're a genius. And the second we say goodbye to Henry, you suggest that maybe I should give up my dream job because you feel bad.
20) 175) dialog: Yes it is my dream job! Just because I have doubts doesn't mean I don't want it.
20) 177) dialog: All right? But what do you care? Every day you go on your two hour "contemplative" walk under the olive trees. Socrates... you should get a robe.
20) 179) dialog: No, by the time you leave, and by the time you're actually with us again, two hours. You know, I could never do that. You're very good at taking care of yourself. I take care of myself, AND everything else. We're going somewhere, you pack your bag, I pack EVERYTHING else.
20) 181) dialog: Because there would be no shoes and plenty of dirty underwear.
20) 183) dialog: I'm happy you have time to contemplate the universe and have existential problems because I don't - I barely have time to think. I work, I baby- sit, I work, I baby-sit. Jesse wanders off into the bathroom to take a pee.
20) 185) dialog: You know what? The only time I get to think now, is when I take a shit at the office. I'm starting to associate thoughts with the smell of shit.
20) 187) dialog: I'm sure you will - and that'll be the best line in the book. She walks over and talks to him directly while he's in th bathroom.
20) 188) dialog: And by the way, you may never, EVER, use me or anything I say or do in one of your fucking books again! And that goes for the girls, too. Jesse comes back out.
20) 190) dialog: As always, OUR life works for YOU.
20) 194) dialog: 6 o'clock.
20) 196) dialog: Yeah, and you remind me of it every single day.
20) 198) dialog: You know what I love about men? They still believe in magic. Little fairies around who pick up their socks, little fairies unload the dishwasher, little fairies sunscreen the kids. Little fairies who make the fucking Greek salads that you eat like a pig.
20) 200) dialog: Okay, stop patronizing me, all right? I'm the one at home every night at 6.00, not 6.30. I am reliable. Have you ever booked a baby sitter, ever, in your entire life? NO. What is the name of their pediatrician?
20) 202) dialog: Yeah, okay. You know what? I'm at home every night and I make dinner, I give baths, and I read bedtime stories. Sometimes you're there, sometimes you're at a university event or a publicity tour. Ok? When you get "inspired" you keep on writing. I get inspired too sometimes, you know that?
20) 204) dialog: No, but you remember I used to sing and play guitar and write songs? I'd still like to do it. But I don't get to - there isn't time.
20) 207) dialog: You think you're winning?! (almost losing her temper ) Very few people realize what it is like for an active or passionate woman to have a child. Some friends told me, "you'll see, you'll want to throw them out the window." Okay, but the truth is I never wanted to hurt them once but I thought about ending it all for myself a hundred times. I was so confused, and you were always away on a stupid book tour or because of Henry's custody shit and I didn't want to be a burden. Now I know why Sylvia Plath put her head in a toaster.
20) 209) dialog: (losing it) Don't play with words. You know what I mean - toaster, oven. Same thing. You know how many times I was alone with the girls crying with no clue what to do? Do you know the guilt a mother feels when she doesn't know what to do?
20) 211) dialog: I don't think you understand, okay? (a beat) You know what my secret fear is? With every man? Is that they all want to turn me into a submissive housewife.
20) 213) dialog: I don't think I've recovered since giving birth. When they were born, I had no idea what to do. People expect women to have instinct that kicks in, like a female baboon. But I had no idea how to do anything. I loved them so much, and I was doing everything wrong. And you were away so often, calling me, asking me how my day went, and I couldn't even say it to you because I felt so ashamed for being so clueless.
20) 215) dialog: No, I didn't.
20) 217) dialog: I remember the only way I could get them to sleep was to drag that stupid double stroller down the stairs and walk them for hours and hours in the middle of the night, all the way to Pigalle and back. I almost got mugged once... I mean, the only reason why the guy didn't attack me was is that I looked so pathetic. The only upside of being over 35 is that you don't get raped as much. I read it - its true. Jesse laughs. The tone shifts.
20) 221) dialog: I don't think there is one natural human state. The human state is multiple. If that's what you see when you're watching the girls play, that means you're depressed.
20) 223) dialog: When I see them fight, I see beautiful energy of going forward in life and not letting anyone step on them or take away what they want. I like it when they fight - it gives me hope for them.
20) 225) dialog: And you never get angry?
20) 227) dialog: You know something? The way you write in your book, people come up to me and think I make love to some wildcat Henry Miller type... HA! You like to have sex the EXACT same way every time.
20) 229) dialog: Kissy, kissy. Titty, titty. PUSSY. (snoring) Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 105.
20) 231) dialog: Yeah, very simple, and I've been meaning to tell you that lately. You're no Henry Miller, on any level. You know what, this room gives me the creeps, I was expecting something quaint, like the real Greece.
20) 233) dialog: What the hell are we doing here anyway? This is all too planned, like we're supposed to have this great evening. There's no room for spontaneity, it is all gone from our lives. It's stupid and it's not working...
20) 235) dialog: Right, yeah ... and I curse Ariadni and that perv Stefanos for doing this. A couples massage - what the fuck is that? That sounds sleazy to me.
20) 237) dialog: Yeah, I know you do, Mr. Book Tour. Mr. Radisson Hilton. And I know that time when you were doing that reading in Washington, when your cell phone supposedly broke that night - how convenient. Swear on our kids that you didn't fuck that lady from the bookstore. Emily. Swear to me you didn't fuck that Emily girl. And I'm not jealous because I'm not the jealous type but I just wanna know, be a man and admit the truth. Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 106.
20) 239) dialog: Yeah - I want to hear.
20) 241) dialog: Yeah okay, I asked you a question. If, while I was carrying the double stroller down the stairs and getting ass-raped in Pigalle, you fucked that little Emily Bronte girl?
20) 243) dialog: The one who wrote the nice emails about Dostoevsky? "Oh Jesse, you're so right, "The Grand Commander" is the deepest passage of all Russian literature."
20) 245) dialog: So you DID fuck her! Thank you very much. Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts ca 107.
20) 247) dialog: You know what's going on here? It's simple - I don't think I love you anymore. She exits. Jesse sits there, gazing from the cold cup of tea, to the door, to the full glasses of wine, to the rum empty bed. Celine doesn't come back.
21) 0) text: Jesse finds Celine sitting near the same table where they saw the sunset earlier.
21) 2) dialog: I don't want to talk right now.
21) 4) dialog: Yeah, I'm by myself and happy to be. I'm an angry person and I hurt my kids, my work, and everyone I love.
21) 6) dialog: Okay, I'm not in the mood - I came here to be alone.
21) 8) dialog: Thank you very much.
21) 11) dialog: Not anymore.
21) 13) dialog: I don't talk to strangers.
21) 15) dialog: You are mistaking me for someone else.
21) 17) dialog: Really? I vaguely remember someone sweet and romantic, who made me feel I wasn't alone anymore. Someone who had respect for who I was.
21) 19) dialog: I don't think so.
21) 21) dialog: Really. What is that?
21) 23) dialog: How?
21) 25) dialog: Okay.
21) 27) dialog: Save me from what?
21) 29) dialog: It's not bullshit.
