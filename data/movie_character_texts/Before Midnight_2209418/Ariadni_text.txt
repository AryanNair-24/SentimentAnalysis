14) 219) dialog: I couldn't agree more. I mean, that's the thing that fucks us up, right? This idea of a soul mate, of someone who will come to complete us and save us from having to take care of ourselves. With Stefanos, I set the bar extremely low - I know he is not going to meet any of my needs.
