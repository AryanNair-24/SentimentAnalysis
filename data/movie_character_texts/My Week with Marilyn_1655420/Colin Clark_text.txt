She fluffs take after take, gets her words wrong and pauses, looking dazed. COLIN notices her clutching MILLER's hand tightly. But finally a good take comes up.

But she radiates joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance, and MARILYN captures all this perfectly. Within the scene the actor JEREMY SPENSER, playing Nicky, watches from the doorway. Everyone watches silently from behind the camera. No one can look away, least of all COLIN. It feels like one pure joyful moment in the agony the film has become, and Maril is radiant.

He stands up and looks through them, blowing dust away; they have been here for a long time, ignored. He finds the one is looking for - it says simply MM on the can. He takes the short reel of film and threads it through a Movieola in the corner of the room. He turns it on and be to look. The screen bursts into life with an image of MARILYN at h most vital and captivating. It is a copy of some rushes f The Prince And The Showgirl, perhaps given to Colin by Olivier, or perhaps "borrowed" as a souvenir and long sin forgotten. We see MARILYN dancing happily, exaggerating off camera, looking playful and sexy. She is radiant and full of life After a moment she turns and looks off camera - perhaps t where Colin himself would have been standing - and winks happily.
