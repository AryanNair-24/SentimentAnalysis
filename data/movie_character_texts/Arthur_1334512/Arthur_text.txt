0) 18) dialog: Are you familiar with the expression `I can explain everything'?
0) 23) dialog: Terribly sorry, but in the film they used a different model to show the old Batchap getting in and out. This one has no doors, so I'd have to squeeze out the back arsehole first. Which nobody wants...
0) 30) dialog: Well. What with having spunked 1.6 million fat Alberts on this little runaround, I thought why not take it a step further and try to actually collar a few ne-er do wells? It worked for the billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not the future billionaire Arthur Bach- Templemead? Will I have to do traffic school?
0) 34) dialog: To use the technical medical term - megabloodyshitloads. Either that or I've had a stroke! But fret not, I have a designated driver.
0) 40) dialog: The Boy Homeless here neglected to say he'd never driven.
0) 44) dialog: Or that the only reason he's sober is to be ready for the conspiracy of leopards about to seize Manhattan.
0) 49) dialog: I trust this will cover all repairs to New York and any inconvenience to your good selves?
0) 52) dialog: Up up and away! Ah, no, that's the other chap.
1) 6) dialog: Goodness. Why?
1) 10) dialog: Rude man. And who threw hot Americano in whose face again?
1) 22) dialog: It's like a chat show, this. (looking into an imaginary
1) 27) dialog: Oh G-d, I hate when that happens.
1) 31) dialog: Sounds like you had six relatively good years.
1) 35) dialog: I model riding boots, I spend money, I sleep with women. But I have weekends off and I am my own boss.
1) 41) dialog: 
1) 51) dialog: Really, Elverton - if a chap can't help out a few chums, whatever their station in life.
1) 54) dialog: Each has given his or her word to put the criminal life behind them.
1) 60) dialog: I am the Batman. Gotham can sleep easy tonight.
1) 72) dialog: Anyone need a job? My last driver resigned after I filled his limo with squirrels. Preferably sober, clean driving licence?
3) 3) dialog: Stand back!
3) 10) dialog: The what?
4) 3) dialog: Roll up, roll up, folks, let's fix this thing right now. (to his first customer) How much, sir?
4) 7) dialog: Coming right up. (keys it in) Fries with that?
4) 10) dialog: Congratulations everyone! THE
4) 14) dialog: Pierre? Arthur Bach-Templemead. Can you squeeze me in for a little snack? Yeah, just me and a couple of mates.
5) 6) dialog: Pierre! We'd like 182 pate de foie gras, 182 chateaubriand steaks, a motherlode of chips and your entire wine cellar please.
5) 11) dialog: 
5) 16) dialog: Oh, um, this is Sofia. I believe she works for Avis. Checks the cars for dings, dead people in the trunk, that sort of thing. And this is Carmella. Anyway...
5) 23) dialog: Carmella's joking. She's actually a...queen. Of a very small country.
5) 27) dialog: It's terribly small. 9.
5) 32) dialog: Rhode Island could beat the crap out of it in a war.
5) 36) dialog: 85 cents in a cab from one end of the country to the other. I'm talking small.
5) 40) dialog: Just had the entire country carpeted, this is not a big place.
5) 44) dialog: That's easy for you to say, you haven't got 50 pairs of short trousers hanging in your closet. Maybe we should go somewhere else.
5) 49) dialog: Could I have all those lobsters to go, please?
8) 3) dialog: Cup of tea? Nice hot cup of hot Rosy Lee right up your fanny?
10) 3) dialog: Hugh Grant Mr Bean self deprecation mad cow disease Yorkshire pudding bad teeth rain rain rain rain!
12) 3) dialog: (brightly, as he humps) Morning, Hobson!
12) 11) dialog: Umm...Celebration of Kwanzaa.
12) 18) dialog: (noticing Sofia's stopped having sex with him) Why are you stopping? Oh, sorry. How impolite of me. Sofia, this is Hobson, my nanny.
12) 26) dialog: Hobson, could you come back in a minute and a half please?
12) 30) dialog: Nobody told me.
12) 37) dialog: Hobson! Really...
12) 51) dialog: Cancel my mother please, Hobson. I'll work from bed today.
12) 56) dialog: Not the death metal, please!
12) 63) dialog: 
12) 69) dialog: I'm going for a shower.
13) 3) dialog: 
13) 10) dialog: Female Tom Hanks!
14) 8) dialog: Can we invite her up and dress her as Forrest Gump?
14) 12) dialog: Just for a laugh! We'll pay her.
15) 6) dialog: Father Wolverine...
15) 10) dialog: Wank Williams...That man has the constitution of an ox.
15) 19) dialog: I give you `Sideways farting spider'.
15) 25) dialog: I'm a philanthropist.
15) 29) dialog: (shifts to new pose) `Eagle pointing at lesbian.'
15) 33) dialog: What kind of yoga teacher won't let a pupil invent positions? She was a Nazi with a pan pipe C.D.
15) 38) dialog: I know, I know. Never bite the hand that fists me.
16) 9) dialog: Give the guy a chance, Hobson. He got laid off in Chicago...
16) 13) dialog: So? I want interesting, fun people around me, not drones who just get the job done...
16) 16) dialog: Marty! Stop the car!
17) 24) dialog: Can I join your tour please?
17) 48) dialog: Wow. What did you say?
17) 53) dialog: A circle?
18) 11) dialog: 
18) 16) dialog: Absolutely.
18) 19) dialog: These things are amazing. Have you ever put all your father's clothes on and just got inside one?
20) 10) dialog: The building doesn't retract; the ground rises up.
20) 14) dialog: They were going to install giant legs so if a plane was flying at the tower it could run away. But where's it going to run?
20) 18) dialog: It'd have to jump in the Hudson.
20) 29) dialog: If you go on Perez Hilton or TMZ.
20) 33) dialog: The gossip websites.
20) 37) dialog: For the internet? Seriously?
20) 41) dialog: You consider the internet an upgrade? Wow.
20) 45) dialog: Ah, that was a joke. I'm nobody.
20) 54) dialog: Hobson, this is... (reads her badge) Naomi.
20) 67) dialog: My nanny.
20) 71) dialog: My nanny. Well, she started as that, but these days she's more of an all-round enforcer and bodyguard.
20) 76) dialog: Can I call you?
21) 3) dialog: But what if this is the one?
21) 7) dialog: 
22) 3) dialog: I don't like it here.
22) 10) dialog: Hi Grant. Tell me - which of your parents are you most like? Abercrombie or Fitch?
22) 26) dialog: Vivienne.
22) 30) dialog: I'm sorry. You look more like a Vivienne.
23) 6) dialog: Quite busy. I have a riding boot shoot for Petrie Dressage... 26.
23) 10) dialog: What else...I'm meeting Ivanka Trump for brunch to discuss the environment. She's sending her helicopter to avoid the traffic...
23) 13) dialog: Crashed my Batmobile into the bronze bull on Wall Street...
23) 16) dialog: ...which caused a hole to swallow up the New York Stock Exchange...
23) 19) dialog: ..the world economy to collapse and the planet to descend into looting and cannibalism.
23) 22) dialog: What else? Um...tripped over in the shower this morning. Head split open, found a family of meerkats hiding in there! Hated the thought of the little lads being homeless so I bricked up the remaining half of my brain, popped them back in and Hobson glued my skull back together.
23) 25) dialog: I'm thinking of buying a giant. I think the market's right for it.
23) 28) dialog: You really are a shoddy mother.
23) 34) dialog: Amazing. Do you have any vodka?
23) 38) dialog: I still wake up in my own poo occasionally.
23) 45) dialog: Can't Hobson set them aside for me?
23) 49) dialog: 
23) 55) dialog: Not after you ran him over in the Bentley, no. Susan's boring. She's not funny.
23) 59) dialog: ...and sinking your fangs into Susan's father's bank account.
23) 63) dialog: His baby formula was taken off the market in six African countries!
23) 67) dialog: Yes, because they're never insane. And where did he get Jesus?
23) 72) dialog: He strangled a fireman! Who strangles a fireman?
23) 77) dialog: I'm sorry, Vivienne. I've met someone else very lovely who, as far as I know, isn't related to anyone who would kill an unsung hero in cold blood.
23) 81) dialog: I nearly gave you an heir!
23) 85) dialog: That was just her stage name! To give her more mystery when she...waved her fanny around. Her real name was...what was it again?
23) 89) dialog: Great! I like hugs! And some of them are really good at math. (heading to the door) You know the `Frog and Toad' books?
23) 93) dialog: Of course you don't. Hobson read them to me while you were off riding horses over stripey poles. They're about fun and friendship, not how many unspasticated tadpoles I can squirt up a rich girl.
23) 98) dialog: That I won't follow in his footsteps and marry a woman I hate? I think he might climb out of the grave and dance on it.
23) 105) dialog: You wouldn't! You're my...
24) 5) dialog: (feeling its huge weight) Did he knock her out with it, then drive her to the church in the trunk of his Bentley?
24) 9) dialog: What's gentlemanly about dying before I knew him? That's just rude. Did he ever love my mother? 31.
24) 14) dialog: Ah well. At least he doesn't have to wake up every day to a woman with a face like saran wrap stretched over a gargoyle.
24) 17) dialog: What about Naomi?
24) 21) dialog: Uh-oh...
24) 25) dialog: I have you for that.
24) 29) dialog: Yes forever. You're Hobson.
25) 13) dialog: I'm sorry, I've never really understood that question. Are you free tomorrow night?
26) 3) dialog: Is that a euphemism for something naughty?
26) 8) dialog: I have a contractual commitment. Friday?
26) 12) dialog: Paper.
26) 17) dialog: Sorry, I was talking to something else. So. What do you want to do? 33.
26) 25) dialog: Movie? Come on, you've got to try harder than that.
26) 29) dialog: What have you always wanted to do?
26) 33) dialog: Every date will be our honeymoon.
27) 3) dialog: What sort of food do you like?
27) 7) dialog: Oh come on. This all helps build up a profile of you before I trick you into my basement. I'd hate to not have your favourite snacks ready.
28) 3) dialog: Hi! Is it June 19th at 7 pm?
28) 7) dialog: FUCK! We overshot! Time travel can be a real cunt sometimes, don't you think? I'll be right back. See you in an hour and a half ago...
29) 5) dialog: A trampoline and a selection of woodland creatures if that's not too much trouble.
29) 10) dialog: Ah!
29) 14) dialog: Bollocks.
29) 18) dialog: Cheers ears.
29) 21) dialog: `Genuine Sword of the First Crusade. Excavated Germany, 1972'.
29) 24) dialog: Jesus Fucking Christ!
29) 28) dialog: Feel the force, Luke.
29) 35) dialog: I, er, had a bit of food stuck in my teeth and couldn't find a toothpick.
29) 41) dialog: You don't, um, have anything stronger, do you?
29) 48) dialog: Surely a glass of sherry at Christmas?
29) 53) dialog: And also with me.
29) 58) dialog: You're the real Slim Shady? I knew it! 37.
29) 64) dialog: You could switch to Judaism. (glances up at the fan) Bit warm in here. Do you mind if I put the fan on?
29) 69) dialog: Yes, it's a problem, isn't it?
29) 72) dialog: Let's knock our heads together and find a way to stop her loving me....Got it! We'll tell her I'm on the sex offenders register....No, I am and she knows.
29) 77) dialog: One Moslem doesn't make a mosque, Burt.
29) 82) dialog: No, sir, it was Prince Alois of Lichtenstein and he made love to me. The fact that it took three bottles of poppers and a Jacuzzi full of Krug to loosen me up confirmed my heterosexuality.
29) 88) dialog: Crikey. Couldn't there just be some kind of on-the-spot fine?
29) 94) dialog: Oh bollocks.
29) 97) dialog: It's a miracle! He is risen!
29) 100) dialog: Hi Susan. Erica.
29) 107) dialog: Shall we go?
30) 6) dialog: Do you have something with less words please? The chef doesn't have to re-cook it, just scrape off the nouns and trim out all that gibberish in the middle.
30) 12) dialog: A bowl of champagne and a spoon.
30) 17) dialog: I'm sorry. I just can't handle the whole specials act. It's not a Shakespearean soliloquy, it's some heated up dead things that aren't on the main menu. 40.
30) 24) dialog: Um hm.
30) 28) dialog: Is it possible to buy the house but then rent it out? Sorry, joke. I'm not suggesting pimping you.
30) 31) dialog: Look. You after our first child is born.
30) 35) dialog: Such as?
30) 39) dialog: Susan. Why are we together?
30) 44) dialog: We don't have the same sense of humour. We don't like the same films, food, music. You like horses, I think they're arrogant idiots...
30) 48) dialog: That depends on the opposites. Racists and the Nation of Islam don't secretly want to 69 each other. Susan, you're beautiful. You're bright. You're fucking loaded. Is there really no one else who could make you happy?
30) 52) dialog: Never?
30) 57) dialog: Daddy what? Prayed to Jesus for it not to work out, then shot the bloke behind a meat truck? Because Jesus would consider that cheating.
30) 63) dialog: Susan. You're the only woman...at this table.
30) 69) dialog: How do you know? What if the drunker I get the better it is for me? Not everyone who drinks is a poet, Susan. Some of us drink because we're not poets.
30) 74) dialog: It'd have to be a real big woman.
30) 83) dialog: Susan. Would you marry me? Take the weekend if you want...
30) 94) dialog: Erica? She hates me.
30) 98) dialog: Oh, come on. She always looks like she wants to set fire to my face then put it out with an Uzi.
30) 104) dialog: What's going on? I only just bloody proposed!
31) 3) dialog: What have I done, Kitt? This mistake's up there with Hitler joining his school debating team...
31) 10) dialog: Maybe I'd rather be fabulously poor. Some poor people I see look happy. 44.
31) 15) dialog: Don't patronise me. I have a job.
33) 7) dialog: Or road awareness.
34) 3) dialog: Can you put this on please?
34) 8) dialog: Trust me.
34) 12) dialog: I give you my word - if I kill and eat you, you'll never see me again.
34) 23) dialog: 
34) 27) dialog: You said you wanted a picnic.
34) 33) dialog: The picnic fairies. Who liaised with the flower fairies, the candle fairies, the log fire fairies, the hidden sound system fairies...
34) 36) dialog: ...and the pizza fairies.
34) 42) dialog: It's nice to keep it simple like this. I'm sick of Michelin-star restaurants. All that embarrassing crap with the specials.
34) 50) dialog: I get by.
34) 57) dialog: I once inadvertently financed a terrorist cell who said they needed ВЈ100,000 to open a falafel stall.
34) 62) dialog: What's the craziest thing you ever told a tour party?
34) 74) dialog: Sounds like you're very good to him.
34) 78) dialog: (not relating at all) Yeah. I hate that. (looks at her phone) Nice bit of kitsch. Where did you find that?
34) 82) dialog: It's...You've had it twelve years?
34) 95) dialog: I couldn't decide between picnic in the park and dinner with a view. So it's a picnic in the sky! Isn't it ace?
34) 100) dialog: Oh, sorry. Forgot. They said to put these on.
34) 103) dialog: 
34) 107) dialog: So what got you into the walking tours?
34) 111) dialog: Be still. Breathe deep. (strikes a Zen pose) `When you can be calm in the midst of activity, this is the true state of nature': Huanchu Daoeren. 51.
34) 116) dialog: (handing her something) Taste this truffle.
34) 122) dialog: So anyway. The tours...
34) 127) dialog: What did you write?
34) 131) dialog: Kids can be so cruel...
34) 137) dialog: I told you, don't worry. These crane people know what they're doing!
34) 145) dialog: Um. Out of interest, how did you get up here?
34) 160) dialog: OWWW! You don't understand! We're 180 feet up in the sky!
34) 166) dialog: No, we're not high! Well we are, but only in the literal sense.
34) 169) dialog: 
34) 173) dialog: Hurry!
34) 177) dialog: No! That's the bouquet of world hams!
35) 3) dialog: I had fun tonight.
36) 6) dialog: 
36) 11) dialog: In case I'm passed out drunk rather than medically dead?
36) 16) dialog: 
36) 36) dialog: Sorry, everyone. that graphic's too colourful and this hangover's a 7.6 on the Richter..the Sickter...
36) 44) dialog: No, thanks.
36) 51) dialog: Why all this crap now? What's the rush anyway?
36) 56) dialog: A month? I was thinking more sort of ten, fifteen years. Just to really enjoy the anticipation of the big day.
36) 61) dialog: (gets out his cellphone) Sorry, Dwight D. Bridalshower, Operation Ball and Chain will have to wait.
37) 3) dialog: Here we are.
37) 7) dialog: I can promise you won't get wet.
39) 5) dialog: Yeah, fine. Actually... 57.
40) 5) dialog: Everything is 99 cents?
40) 10) dialog: `Warning: This product contains chromium, which may be linked to chronic bronchitis and reproductive hazards."
40) 15) dialog: Maybe China's trying to wipe out the west's children one by one.
40) 20) dialog: Why? 58.
40) 25) dialog: Yes please.
40) 41) dialog: Just fascinated. 59.
40) 46) dialog: You're good at fascinating.
40) 49) dialog: Are you okay? Let me help you.
40) 54) dialog: (offers her another) This one?
40) 58) dialog: This one?
40) 62) dialog: This one?
40) 65) dialog: No. I think I hear a mouse inside.
40) 68) dialog: Oh my G-d. This is a good one. No rodents. Packed.
40) 71) dialog: Quick, before someone gets it.
40) 79) dialog: Look. Us in a year's time.
40) 82) dialog: If you got ill, I'd care for you.
41) 5) dialog: I didn't know you knew him.
41) 9) dialog: Why is he coming?
41) 17) dialog: If you can bring Erica, I can bring Hobson.
41) 21) dialog: She's my Hobson.
41) 31) dialog: Reminiscent of a French castle perched 500 feet above New York, the penthouse was known from early days as the `Chateau in the Sky'.
41) 36) dialog: Where George Gershwin and the Astors danced to Shep Fields and his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra.
41) 39) dialog: Come on, cheap girl. We can be Fred Austere and Stingy Rogers.
41) 44) dialog: Behind the telephone box fish tank. See you on the balcony. 62.
42) 4) dialog: Your kids' book. What was it about?
42) 8) dialog: Be serious.
42) 12) dialog: I love it. 63.
42) 17) dialog: Did he catch the heart?
42) 24) dialog: Only if I'm sad, happy or bored. There's this bit in a book Hobson used to read me as a kid that says it all: `We must stop eating cookies, Frog!' cried Toad, as he ate another.'
42) 28) dialog: 
42) 32) dialog: So Frog took the box outside. He shouted in a loud voice, `Hey birds, here are cookies!' Birds came from everywhere. They picked up all the cookies in their beaks and flew away. `
42) 36) dialog: Now we have no more cookies to eat' `Excellent!' said Toad, `I am going home now to bake a cake.'
43) 9) dialog: I couldn't tell her, Hobson. She isn't the Komodo dragon. She's my toad.
43) 13) dialog: Yes.
43) 35) dialog: I'd be wary, Grant. She's planning to ride you around the course next. Her last boyfriend broke his ankle jumping that ditch. Had to be destroyed on the spot.
43) 40) dialog: I'm in love. With a woman who isn't exactly who you'd describe as Susan. She's called Naomi.
43) 44) dialog: Won't you at least meet her?
43) 48) dialog: The Snarts of Detroit. 66.
43) 53) dialog: No, because they're normal. She's a walking tour guide, her dad's a retired car worker.
43) 57) dialog: Unbelievable! Why don't you just keep me here, pay a servant to wank me into a bottle once a day...
43) 61) dialog: ...then inject it all into a field of heiresses and see who farts out a thoroughbred first?
43) 65) dialog: Fine! You can have one with Stevey Steroids here! Surely even your uterus has had a face lift by now.
43) 71) dialog: None of your business, J Crew.
43) 77) dialog: You can shove your inheritance up your horse's arse! 67.
43) 83) dialog: Why would you do that? You'd never get it back.
44) 5) dialog: I ate the whole jar.
44) 9) dialog: I'm engaged. To another Susan. Woman. Engaged to another woman.
44) 12) dialog: I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
44) 16) dialog: I was going to tell you! I just... 68.
44) 22) dialog: Please, Naomi! I didn't mean for it to get to this! I planned to just be your friend but then I started to fall for you and I thought `I can't marry Susan, I might fall for Naomi!' But I thought `No I have to marry Susan or I'll be poor so I won't fall for Naomi' But then I did fall for you! Because you're brainy and funny and gorgeous and too smart to do walking tours. You're too smart, Snart. Smart Snart. There's a 99 cent cereal.
44) 27) dialog: Thanks. Then she said `Noooo, if you don't marry Susan, I'll make you pay all the inheritance money back even if you can't - ha ha ha'. Okay she didn't laugh but she might as well have, the evil cow. Because it's like all the money ever and they'll put not just me but both of us in prison and your dad, like in Dickens. There'll be ghosts, and Oliver and....
44) 33) dialog: Toad? Stay a bit longer. Please? 69.
44) 38) dialog: 'cause it'll reduce the proportion of my life I'll spend feeling utterly miserable.
44) 44) dialog: Bea Arthur? What's she got to do with all this?
49) 32) dialog: (lip syncing too) So take a look at me now, 'cause there's just an empty space. And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face.
49) 36) dialog: Take a look at me now, `cause there's just an empty space, And you coming back to me is against all odds and that's what I've got to face...Just take a look at me now.
49) 42) dialog: But..but this took ages to rehearse. I had the frog outfit specially made. These aren't actual tourists.
49) 46) dialog: What do you mean?
49) 50) dialog: I just wanted to see you.
50) 3) dialog: Hobson! Female Tom Hanks has had a haircut! Hobson?
50) 8) dialog: Marty? What are you doing there?
50) 12) dialog: She's had quite a few headaches lately.
50) 22) dialog: Not until you answer my question.
50) 27) dialog: Will you cut it out? 74.
50) 33) dialog: Hobson, please. Don't die any more. It's getting very boring.
50) 37) dialog: Naomi doesn't want to see me.
50) 41) dialog: Listen, old woman. Don't ever talk about Naomi that way again. What gives you the right to be such a snob? You're just...you're just... Mary Poppins with a menopause!
50) 44) dialog: Hobson, I've never raised my voice to you. I'm sorry.
50) 48) dialog: Do you want anything?
50) 52) dialog: Sorry, it's your job to be older.
51) 6) dialog: I can't have this getting out. I'm in the public eye.
53) 7) dialog: Jesus....
53) 18) dialog: Whoooaaahh. Okay, cut. I don't know about anyone else, but this isn't exactly killing my thirst.
53) 22) dialog: Gandalf.
53) 25) dialog: I'm sorry, you're not going to convince me my life isn't fun.
53) 39) dialog: It's always the quiet ones.
55) 3) dialog: Thanks, Hobson. Maybe you can go every time I crave a drink? 78.
55) 7) dialog: Susan? Look, I know the wedding date is set. But fancy bringing it forward? I just want to get it over with. In a good way. Think about it, yeah?
55) 10) dialog: It's the agony of possibility, Hobson. It just hurts too much to know I could still be with Naomi if I had the guts.
61) 6) dialog: Thank you, Burt! I've actually prepared a little surprise song with my friends here. 84.
61) 10) dialog: Why does cash suddenly appear, every time you are near?
61) 13) dialog: Just like me, it longs to be, close to Sue. Why do cars fall out of the sky, all of which, I can buy...
63) 25) dialog: It's okay, Jeff. She can stay.
64) 5) dialog: But what about the other blackouts?
65) 6) dialog: She's fine. They're sending her home. Do you want a drink? 87.
65) 11) dialog: But you came all this way. There's ridiculously fancy food, there's...
65) 15) dialog: You're a cab.
65) 18) dialog: Shit. Hobson usually...
65) 23) dialog: Thank you for coming all this way. I'm sorry for all the stupid presents and calls and gestures.
65) 30) dialog: What were you like as a kid?
65) 36) dialog: Dance?
65) 49) dialog: Hobson used to sing it to me.
65) 55) dialog: She's a writer.
65) 62) dialog: Maybe someone will see her potential.
65) 71) dialog: Vivienne, please. Don't...
65) 82) dialog: NAOMI! PLEASE! I didn't think I would ever see you again. I was just trying to give you some... 90.
65) 89) dialog: I do express love! I love you!
65) 93) dialog: You just told me to! And stop going on about me being rich! You think it's easy being trapped by money?
65) 98) dialog: Abu Greed?
65) 102) dialog: No. Being cheap gives you that.
65) 106) dialog: At least I'm prepared to have fun. To live. I'm not all `Oooh look at me with my antique food, aren't I cool?' And...and...your phone's RUBBISH! It's made of bits of old doorbell and vibrator, I bet you can only get calls from 1994 on it! 91.
65) 117) dialog: Naomi, please...
65) 126) dialog: It's okay, Hobson's fine. I spoke to her doctor.
66) 5) dialog: Stop saying that! You bribed a hospital orderly to tell me you were okay! 92.
66) 11) dialog: Da dahhhh! I give you the amazing costly, health-giving presents!
66) 14) dialog: 'Wake up and Smell the Carcass'.. (reads the DVD) `A compilation of the band's most stomach-churning music videos and deathly live performances...'
66) 17) dialog: Put this on, please.
66) 21) dialog: Put it on. Or I'll fire you.
68) 3) dialog: Home? That's great news. Isn't it?
69) 3) dialog: How did this get here?
69) 7) dialog: You might have a brain tumour but you're not a complete veggie burger just yet. Has Naomi been here? 94.
69) 12) dialog: I thought she gave up writing.
69) 17) dialog: Don't wear yourself out. You're not going anywhere soon.
69) 20) dialog: World's most advanced heart rate monitor. The tiniest problem will alert your own private platoon of paramedics camped out downstairs...
69) 32) dialog: But you spent half of it looking after a spoilt drunk twat.
69) 36) dialog: Sorry, Hobson, You don't win this one. I need you to care for me. (holds up a pill) Now take your fish oil.
70) 3) dialog: Hobson?
70) 6) dialog: 
71) 6) dialog: Would Frog ever get up again? Or would he just sit in his tank, crying and soiling himself until he died of dehydration because he didn't even have the energy to eat a wet sandwich.
71) 9) dialog: Hobson! Why are you in there when I need you? (lifts lid off urn)
71) 13) dialog: Arrrrgghhh!
71) 16) dialog: Sorry.
71) 20) dialog: Shockingly bad, thanks, Marty.
71) 24) dialog: Nahhh. Can I be alone please?
76) 3) dialog: (leaving a message) Naomi? I doubt you'll ever get this, because your voicemail probably consists of a 4000 year old woman who writes the message down in hieroglyphics then loses it down the back of her incontinence loin cloth. Hobson died. Hobson died and I've fallen apart...
76) 6) dialog: Marty! Can you get that? Marty!
77) 6) dialog: What do you think's going on? Hobson died.
77) 14) dialog: You're comparing Hobson to...a dog?
77) 18) dialog: Um, I think I'd like you to leave, if that's okay. Now?
77) 25) dialog: Don't worry. If I'm going to drink myself to death I'll need resources. Bye Vivienne...
77) 29) dialog: My mother's dead.
77) 32) dialog: Hello? I'm sorry? 99.
78) 7) dialog: That'll explain the strong smell of bear shit. Sorry.
81) 5) dialog: Naomi!
81) 8) dialog: You're on a bus? With a microphone?
81) 12) dialog: Naomi. Can you take the next 60 years off?
81) 16) dialog: Sorry. I accidentally swallowed three bottles of hand sanitizer. Fascinating story...Okay.
81) 20) dialog: Drinking was the only way I could get the courage to come here and say this: I don't need the money. I love the money. But I don't lie awake all night wondering how I'll live without ever seeing it again. I just wonder what it's like to go 24 hours without a steak tartare.
81) 23) dialog: The American Express Centurion card - you have to spend at least $250,000 a year to keep it, which I blow in a quiet week.

81) 52) dialog: These are from The Gap.
81) 57) dialog: I'm sorry about the Rainbow Press.
81) 61) dialog: She didn't.
81) 65) dialog: What's it to you? She's your arch- enemy.
81) 69) dialog: I couldn't tell her! Today's the biggest day of her life!
81) 74) dialog: 12. Which is... (looks at his wrist) Where's my watch gone?
81) 78) dialog: It's too late, then.
81) 81) dialog: I don't know her number! It's in my phone's address book in that gloop.
81) 85) dialog: St. John the Divine. Can we please just get me some clothes...
81) 89) dialog: You want me to go there? Like this?
81) 93) dialog: No! I love you!
81) 98) dialog: Naomi! Susan's dad will... 104.
81) 104) dialog: Naomi! I don't even know the way!
81) 109) dialog: 
81) 113) dialog: Um, can anyone spare... (to the DRIVER) How much to St. John the Divine please?
81) 117) dialog: (to the crowd) Can anyone spare $15 please?
81) 121) dialog: 
81) 125) dialog: Stop! STOP!
87) 3) dialog: 
87) 7) dialog: `Chicken forgetting birthday'...
87) 10) dialog: 
87) 14) dialog: How far can I go with $1.95 and a Japanese coin with a hole in it? 106.
87) 19) dialog: 
88) 5) dialog: 
90) 3) dialog: (to A MALE PASSENGER) Excuse me. Terribly sorry to bother you, but...
90) 6) dialog: Crikey. Thanks. 107.
92) 31) dialog: Ah! I'm trying to get to...
96) 3) dialog: I'm not him. (shows his wrists) Look ma! No holes.
97) 8) dialog: Susan. I can't...I can't...
97) 13) dialog: The girl at the party? The one who talked all that rubbish about Coffee Mate? I love her.
97) 18) dialog: But I don't love you!
97) 22) dialog: Well, yes. What's not to... 110.
97) 27) dialog: Susan, you're upset, you hate me. It's okay. Now I'm sorry, I have to go, or your dad's going to do whatever he did to your boyfriend from college.
97) 31) dialog: HER? You're..a...
97) 35) dialog: But...why do you want to marry...
97) 38) dialog: Hang on. Am I your beard?
97) 42) dialog: 
97) 47) dialog: Wow. Wow. Well. Uh... (heads to the door) Thanks for your honesty. I don't feel so bad about calling this off.
97) 53) dialog: I may be a weak, pathetic drunk. But I won't marry a lesbian Dane Cook fan.
98) 3) dialog: Good evening, St. John the Divine! Anyone in from St. Patrick's? Bialystoker Synagogue? Manhattan Mosque? AA?
99) 7) dialog: ...and the first turned to the second horse and said `That dog just spoke'.
99) 10) dialog: The joke being that it's inconsistent that the horses can speak but the dog can't.
99) 13) dialog: The wedding's off. The bride has had second thoughts. I can't say I blame her. Would you marry me?
99) 17) dialog: 
99) 21) dialog: Great. I'm glad we had this talk. I'll let you get on with the wedding....
99) 56) dialog: Why didn't you tell me? We could have worked something out.
99) 59) dialog: I'm joking.
100) 3) dialog: OW! Stop it! Why are you doing that?
100) 7) dialog: No, you keep still.
100) 12) dialog: I'll get a job. I'll model cheap riding boots for people with no horses. You can write books about boys whose lungs have run away.
100) 20) dialog: Sorry, Vivienne. I can't do that.
100) 24) dialog: You've never earned that title. I wouldn't fake it with Susan. I won't with you.
100) 28) dialog: I don't.
100) 31) dialog: Take care, Viv.
101) 4) dialog: Sorry, Marty. This isn't mine any more. Fancy joining us for a bowl of Special J?
104) 3) dialog: Operational heat controls in a shower are a basic human right!
105) 11) dialog: What the hell's in this shampoo? Napalm? It sure as hell isn't tea tree oil...
105) 16) dialog: I thought you liked me.
106) 3) dialog: (reading it out) `Can I be your friend at least? Love, Vivienne xxx. P.S. Lunch sometime? P.P.S. The inheritance is yours. It always was.'
108) 3) dialog: Brought her for moral support. But I'll do the talking this time.
