12) 6) dialog: Morning, Arthur.
12) 9) dialog: I'm afraid your impromptu stimulus package failed to reignite the economy. (reading a receipt) De Cache Cocktail Lounge: $23,897?
12) 14) dialog: The African heritage festival celebrated five months from now?
12) 22) dialog: He's merely shaped like an adult.
12) 28) dialog: Negative. You're seeing your mother this morning.
12) 32) dialog: Actually I did, on the other side of the vast moat of champagne known as `last night'.
12) 35) dialog: I wouldn't recommend letting him get used to your breasts, dear. Addictive personality. He was at mine until he was six.
12) 39) dialog: I had to dab Tabasco sauce on the nipples to see him off...
12) 45) dialog: I support your decision 100%. Will you be requiring a taxi, or just be getting in a random passing car?
12) 48) dialog: Say goodbye to your new friends, Arthur. They have to go back to the recession now.
12) 58) dialog: (shouting over the music) Aren't you a fan of Carcass?
12) 61) dialog: `Vomited Anal Tract' is surely a classic of its genre.
12) 67) dialog: Good boy.
12) 71) dialog: I'll alert the media. 14.
13) 7) dialog: They brought an intelligent elephant and Nellie was her name...Hobson!
14) 6) dialog: She's early today...
14) 10) dialog: No.
14) 14) dialog: Do your armpits.
14) 19) dialog: Mr. Miller? My employer inexplicably agreed to purchase your...
15) 13) dialog: That reminds me, clean your genitals. Heaven knows what wildlife that girl was harbouring between her thighs.
15) 22) dialog: Arthur, you have to stop giving money away! 16.
15) 27) dialog: With the emphasis on the `pissed'. Really, what is it about unearned wealth that brings out such idiocy in those who have it and those who want it? The way you're going, you'll have spent your inheritance before you've inherited it.
15) 31) dialog: Why did you fire Jessica?
15) 36) dialog: Interesting. It looks more like `Rich twit hiding from mother.' May I remind you, she finances your preposterous existence...
16) 5) dialog: 
16) 11) dialog: But he doesn't know his way around New York!
19) 3) dialog: Where the blazes is that boy? Arthur! 21.
20) 48) dialog: You're late for your mother!
20) 52) dialog: The soup kitchen's just up and to the left, honey.
20) 59) dialog: Delighted to meet you, Naomi. Normally one has to go to a bowling alley to meet a woman of your stature.
20) 63) dialog: You aren't the first woman who walks the streets this young man has asked.
21) 5) dialog: This is just like the Komodo dragon. Everyone else is happy to see one in the zoo and leave it there. You had to own one. Thank goodness that handbag manufacturer was prepared to take the poor lizard away.
21) 10) dialog: He is, Arthur. Are you the only one allowed to joke now?
22) 5) dialog: Of course you don't. People work here.
22) 18) dialog: Don't fret, Arthur. This won't take long. Then we'll have ice cream.
24) 3) dialog: Ah. The ring your father gave your mother, I recall.
24) 7) dialog: No. Your father was a gentleman.
24) 12) dialog: They had their days.
24) 19) dialog: Arthur. I say this with love:
24) 23) dialog: Even by modern male standards you're a breathtakingly immature little shit. Coupled with the kind of money you have access to, that's deadly. Susan may not have a four hour stand up routine about the Flatiron Building, but she's a solid girl who will look after you.
24) 27) dialog: Not forever.
27) 13) dialog: Time to get engaged, Arthur. The Komodo dragon can wait.
31) 8) dialog: And stop this self-pitying bibble. You're going to be fabulously rich.
31) 13) dialog: That's either because they're far away or you've just given them money. Arthur, poor people have to work. They stand for hours in the rain, waiting for buses full of other poor people to take them to things called `jobs' which they do all year round to pay for holidays away from those jobs.
31) 17) dialog: Lying drunk on a bale of hay in riding boots being photographed by another pampered prick won't prepare you for the work I mean. And I don't want to see you suffer. Take your fish oil.
36) 42) dialog: Will there be anything else, sir?
36) 46) dialog: 
41) 24) dialog: 
41) 50) dialog: He's not like other men, you know.
41) 55) dialog: I know he is. That's the problem.
41) 59) dialog: I'm sure Arthur will explain.
43) 3) dialog: Frog and Toad stayed on the island all afternoon.
43) 6) dialog: They ate wet sandwiches without iced tea. They were two close friends sitting alone together.
43) 11) dialog: You're quite sure about this?
43) 15) dialog: (under her breath) Oh, bollocks.
50) 20) dialog: Put my bears back on, Arthur.
50) 25) dialog: I'm travelling down a white tunnel. To - a garden? Mother? Father? Why is it so hot? Who's the red gentleman with the big pitchfork?
50) 30) dialog: Arthur. There are three books. This is important. Take them back to the library...
50) 35) dialog: Arthur. Old women, like bears, get sore heads. Are you okay? You look a little lost.
50) 39) dialog: A terrible shame she had to go. A little tart like that could have saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
50) 46) dialog: I'm sorry too. You know, Arthur, you may be growing up.
50) 50) dialog: I want to be younger.
50) 57) dialog: Of course, Arthur.
51) 8) dialog: Yes, it would be disastrous to harm such a dignified profile.
51) 11) dialog: It's going to be okay, Arthur.
53) 12) dialog: 
53) 33) dialog: ...and because I have done nothing with the astonishing opportunities handed to me, apart from pissing away my inheritance and drinking enough to kill a rhino.
53) 36) dialog: But imagine being me! I once ended up in bed with the daughters of three of the Rolling Stones. But a) I don't remember a thing about it, b) apparently I was sick on two of the women before c) losing control of my bladder on the third. All such fun...until the strangers I pay to be my friends have gone, the fog parts and there's a hole so big, you could pour all the champagne in the world into it and never fill it up. But I've got so much potential, a good heart, I'm a good person, even if I've completely wasted my short, precious life because I somehow convinced myself that happiness is a Komodo dragon, a case of booze and the memory of having once stripped naked to Beethoven for a coachload of German tourists who I met outside the Rainforest Cafe.
55) 12) dialog: Just promise you'll never ask me to sleep with Susan for you.
57) 3) dialog: Good afternoon, Mr Snart. Is Naomi here? 79.
57) 8) dialog: I must be.
57) 11) dialog: Please stop this, I can't inhale and am in danger of treading on one of your knuckles.
57) 14) dialog: If you and your undershirt would walk two paces back I could enter this dwelling.
57) 21) dialog: Try not to talk. It's not your words but the breath which bears them. Perhaps you could repair to the East Wing and make me a cup of tea? I wish to speak to Naomi.
57) 26) dialog: Arthur is having a pre-wedding party tonight. You should come.
57) 32) dialog: Don't you want to show Arthur how well you're doing?
57) 36) dialog: Arthur doesn't know I'm here. He's far too decent to be involved in something so tawdry. You could bring your father. A magical experience before he's too big to leave this apartment.
57) 41) dialog: My dear, if there's one thing old women can tell, it's young men in love. And the food promises to be breathtakingly free.
57) 46) dialog: Better than you, dear.
57) 50) dialog: Yes. And it is a job that I recommend highly.
57) 53) dialog: You really look out for this gentleman, from what I've heard.
57) 59) dialog: Thank you. Would you go the bathroom and commence washing? You only have three hours and it could be quite a project.
57) 64) dialog: Suit yourself.
57) 69) dialog: Yes. And he has seen me.
57) 73) dialog: Is it something you feel strongly about?
59) 3) dialog: You are not to pull him out of that party on my behalf.
64) 8) dialog: Arthur, I'm fine. Do not leave that party.
66) 3) dialog: It's just a headache!
66) 8) dialog: Oh, bothersnaps. What do doctors know?
66) 19) dialog: I don't want to put it on.
66) 25) dialog: 
66) 29) dialog: 
66) 35) dialog: Why, Arthur? 93.
69) 5) dialog: I have no idea.
69) 10) dialog: She dropped by once or twice. Frightful needy trollop.
69) 15) dialog: Just trying to spare her outright humiliation while I'm still here.
69) 23) dialog: Arthur. I've loved caring for you so much. But you'll never grow up with me around. So either I retire. Or I die. Option 1 involves too much paperwork and blather with having to find somewhere else to live. And no offence to you, dear boy...
69) 26) dialog: ...but I think we've exhausted the bear-based entertainment. Which leaves option 2.
69) 29) dialog: You're a good son, Arthur. You can do anything with your life that you want. Just like I did. 95.
69) 34) dialog: Exactly. Sorry Arthur. I'm past my use-by date.
70) 7) dialog: (hammering the machine) Why the fuck has the stupid thing not gone off?
71) 10) dialog:
