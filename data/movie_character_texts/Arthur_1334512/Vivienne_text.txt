22) 24) dialog: Arthur.
22) 28) dialog: You know I prefer `mother'.
23) 4) dialog: (not looking up) So. How are you, Arthur?
23) 32) dialog: Did I hear you say you were meeting Ivanka Trump for brunch? That's nice. Right. Today we're going to have a friendly chat. Then a serious talk. And lastly make a timetable. How does all that sound?
23) 36) dialog: What happened, Arthur? You were such a sweet baby.
23) 40) dialog: Right, that's it for the chat. Time to transition to our talk.
23) 43) dialog: This insanity has to end, Arthur. As the delightful coffee-coloured gentleman who runs this country said, `The time has come to set aside childish things.'
23) 47) dialog: Susan is a splendid girl. Her feet are on the ground, she's of fine stock...
23) 52) dialog: And? You think I spent my marriage to your father skipping through meadows? 28.
23) 57) dialog: Ditto your father. The aristocracy doesn't marry for `fun', Arthur. It's about stability. Continuity...
23) 61) dialog: The Johnson family's considerable equity in a stormy financial period is merely a side issue. Burt is a pillar of the community.
23) 65) dialog: A completely innocent error in places where there's precious little for children to live for anyway. The families all got gift baskets as compensation. That little bump in the road aside, Burt is a devout Christian.
23) 69) dialog: 
23) 74) dialog: Arthur... 29.
23) 79) dialog: Un-meet her. Arthur, you're the end of our line. We need an heir.
23) 83) dialog: Oh, give me strength! A Bach- Templemead having a child by a lap dancer called `Mystery'?
23) 87) dialog: Susan is 33 this year. Her egg inventory has dropped by 23% since you met her. You risk having no sons, or worse, some pea-brained hunchback who hugs everyone!
23) 91) dialog: No.
23) 95) dialog: Your father would turn in his grave to hear this nonsense... 30.
23) 100) dialog: Suit yourself.
23) 103) dialog: My will, which I have updated to designate Grant in reception as the sole beneficiary.
23) 107) dialog: ...Vivienne? Try me.
23) 110) dialog: Shall we segue to the timetable part of our meeting?
36) 20) dialog: Take this away.
36) 49) dialog: No. You can leave.
43) 38) dialog: Arthur. What's so urgent that you had to come all the way out here?
43) 42) dialog: Arthur, we've been through this!
43) 46) dialog: What family is she from?
43) 51) dialog: Never heard of them.
43) 55) dialog: Susan will generate quality sons, not oil-soaked car monkeys.
43) 59) dialog: Arthur...
43) 63) dialog: We need an heir!
43) 75) dialog: Arthur. Come back here.
43) 81) dialog: Suit yourself, Arthur. Follow your heart. But do be aware I consider what you've squandered so far an advance on your inheritance. That's about $17 million.
43) 85) dialog: No. But you'd spend the rest of your life in court. There's a simple solution to all this. Marry Susan. And cheat with the nobody from Queens.
58) 7) dialog: Splendid affair, Susan.
65) 53) dialog: Is this the tour guide?
65) 59) dialog: Crowded field, writing. 89.
65) 64) dialog: We all know who's seen her potential.
65) 68) dialog: Oh, of course, you don't know, do you?
65) 75) dialog: My son became fond of you. You're not the first. Or the last, I imagine. Anyway I was scanning his monthly expenses - which always makes for entertaining reading, all those gifts for all those girls - and found he'd bought an entire publishing company called...what was it now? Rainbow Press.
65) 79) dialog: He knows people, dear. I'm sure you do too, though the people you know tend not to own books, let alone publishers. Arthur, I trust we'll see you back at the party? Susan's a little worried.
77) 3) dialog: Arthur! You haven't answered the phone for eight days. Susan's beside herself. What's going on? 98.
77) 8) dialog: Oh, that.
77) 11) dialog: 
77) 16) dialog: Well, yes. A faithful, humble companion who...
77) 20) dialog: Remember who pays for this apartment, Arthur. For everything!
77) 23) dialog: You had damn well better be at that wedding, boy.
77) 27) dialog: It's mother!
80) 6) dialog: Don't worry, Burt. He's cleaned himself up. He's stopped drinking, he's anxious to get a real job. He's become a responsible citizen.
99) 31) dialog: Burt! Get off my son!
100) 14) dialog: Stop this!
100) 18) dialog: A Bach-Templemead has never been poor and we're not about to try that experiment with you, Arthur. That said, you've shown strength of character for once, instead of blubbing on about frogs and friendship. The inheritance is yours. All I ask is, with Hobson gone, you finally start treating me like a mother.
100) 22) dialog: I beg your pardon?
100) 26) dialog: Arthur. I will withdraw this offer forever. Don't doubt me, boy.
100) 34) dialog: Arthur! Arthur! I am serious! If you walk out of that door...
