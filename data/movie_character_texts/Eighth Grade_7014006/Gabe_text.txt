0) 190) dialog: Cool. One, two, three- Gabe takes a giant breath and goes underwater. Kayla, a b behind, plugs her nose, closes her eyes and does the same UNDERWATER -- Kayla uses her free hand to paddle and keep herself submerged. After ten seconds, Kayla resurfaces, panting. She wipes t water off her face and looks over at Gabe. He’s floating down in the water, perfectly still, like a drowned corpse Just as Kayla is getting concerned, he resurfaces, pantin
0) 191) dialog: I won. The trick is to waste as little energy as possible. When you move, your body uses oxygen and then you won’t be able to hold your breath as long.

4) 170) dialog: Cool. I got a twenty piece and I also got two of every kind of sauce - but if you have a favorite sauce and want more than one packet of it, you can have mine. I like all the sauces equally.
4) 172) dialog: The chicken tenders have been sitting out for a little bit because I didn’t know when you’d be here so tell me if they’re too cold and I can heat them up in the microwave.
4) 174) dialog: Whoops, left this out by accident. Gabe picks up a PIECE OF PAPER that was sitting right bes Kayla’s plate. He stands in front of her, holding it.

4) 222) dialog: You’re welcome. Gabe stares at his food, looking agitated. Then:
4) 223) dialog: I have to tell you something. 97.
4) 225) dialog: I didn’t make up that bike joke. My dad told it to me.
4) 227) dialog: I shouldn’t have lied to you I’m sorry.
4) 229) dialog: Totally. They eat some more in silence.
4) 230) dialog: I watched some of your videos.
4) 232) dialog: No! No, they’re really cool. You’re really smart about stuff. You know so many things.
4) 234) dialog: I was thinking you should have your own talk show.
4) 236) dialog: I’m sorry if I’m being weird, I’m just really nervous. 98.
4) 238) dialog: We’re having a good conversation I think.

4) 245) dialog: Actually...can I show you something?
4) 247) dialog: Okay. Gabe hops up from the couch and runs out of the room. Kay stays put, sitting up straight, knees bouncing, nervous. We stay on Kayla as we hear the sounds of Gabe’s frantic search: loud footsteps down a hallway, a door opens, clos a pause, door opens again, more footsteps. 99.
4) 248) dialog: (just outside the room) Okay, I’m ready to show you.
4) 250) dialog: It’s not that cool. But maybe you'll think it’s really cool, I don't know, it’s kind of cool, I guess.

4) 253) dialog: Keep your eyes closed.
4) 255) dialog: Okay, you can open your eyes. Kayla does. Gabe is standing in front of her with his han behind his back. There’s a large cardboard box behind him a laptop now open on the coffee table between Kayla and h
4) 256) dialog: So, like, I told you about how I do archery and, um, like, this is sort of like another one of my passions. Gabe keeps one hand behind his back as the other reaches and hits the laptop’s spacebar. HEAVY METAL MUSIC begins blast as Gabe pulls TWO LARGE SILVER RINGS from behind hi back and begins his magic routine. Gabe’s hands shake with adrenaline as he does his linking rings routine. Then reaches into the box, does more trick color changing scarves, cutting and melding ropes. The face-melting guitar doesn’t quite match up with Gabe’ routine. But Gabe is taking this very seriously, too nerv to look up at Kayla and see if she’s liking it or not. He practiced this a thousand times, and this is it: his mome 100. And as Gabe struggles through his act, messing up here, dropping a prop there, Kayla watches him. Someone is doing something for her. And she is watching it. Smiling. Her world upside-down. The pressure, finally, for a moment, off. EXT. STREET. GABE’S HOUSE LATER Dad waits in his car, parked on the street in front of Ga house. He stares ahead, turns, sees something, smiles. Kayla enters the car.
