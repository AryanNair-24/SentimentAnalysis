4) 123) dialog: Like I’1l be nervous even when there’s nothing to be nervous about really. Like...it’s sort of like when you wait in line for a roller coaster and you have that nervous stomach, like I feel like that all the time, like every day, and I don’t ever get that feeling you get after you ride the roller coaster when you feel better. It’s just like I’m waiting in the line all the time. And I try really hard not feel like that but, I don’t know, I just can’t. INT. MILES GROVE MIDDLE SCHOOL HALLWAY. LATER.

And then, like, I was thinking, if she was like me, I think that would make me really sad all the time. Cause I would love her a lot because she’s my daughter but...I don’t know, I guess if she ended up being like me, I think being her mom would make me really sad.

5) 5) dialog: I wrote you that letter thanking you for having me to your party and you didn’t write back, like not even a facebook message, and that’s really stupid and mean. And being mean isn’t cool, it’s MEAN. When someone does something nice you're supposed to do something nice back. I’m always nice to you and you’re never nice to me and that’s not fair. I’m a good person and you should be nicer to me. Kennedy looks shocked/disgusted. Kayla turns to walk away whips back.
5) 6) dialog: (angrier) And that card game I got you for your birthday is actually REALLY FUN and you’d know that if you actually PLAYED IT. And I know you probably think it’s stupid but stupid games can be fun sometimes, like if it’s raining outside or whatever, it’s a great game, it’s like a really fun version of Go Fish, and if you actually just tried playing it instead of trying to be cool all the time you'd realize that it’s really fun game to play when you’re bored. And- Kayla turns and walks away. Back up the line. The adrenal of the moment still coursing through her. She retakes her spot in line. Taking deep breaths to calm herself. 103. She smiles.
