Gilliam stands up, letting his rags drop. His entire body revealed for the first time. He has one arm and one leg each. But he has no trouble balancing himself. A lean, muscular YOUNG MAN gently squeezes a crutch underneath Gilliam’s armpit. Gilliam walks out towards Mason. Like the subjects of an elderly king, the Tail Section Passengers noiselessly mov open a path for Gilliam. The Young Man stays on Gilliam’s heels - his eyes darting about to locate danger.
