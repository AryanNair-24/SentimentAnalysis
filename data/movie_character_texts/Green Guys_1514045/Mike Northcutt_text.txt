66) 1) dialog: Basically...what I believe...is that it's a form of online banking, but they use their own program and their own database. For instance, if someone gives them one hundred thousand dollars, they create an “account" for this person. With this "account" the investor can check their balance, can check their gains, losses etc. But what I believe they're doing...is setting up invisible money. This account...this number...is just that...a number. It has no monetary representation. They actually deposit the investment into their own account.

So when they give their investors the returns, they are actually depositing money into that person's account, but it is only a small percentage of what that person invested.
