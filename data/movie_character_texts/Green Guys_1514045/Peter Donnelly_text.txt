66) 11) text: First off, you ever call me Peter again and I’ll rip your nose off your fucking face. You address me as “sir” or you address me as Mister Donnelly. I may be attractive and youthful but I have earned my status as “Mister.” You got that? Mike doesn’t react.
66) 12) dialog: Issue number two..we are not in the business of skepticism Mike. We are in the business of fact. And I like facts. Facts don’t fucking lie, and the only facts you have right now, Mike, Mike Northcutt, is that you are a novice fucking official that enjoys raising his voice to heads of criminal investigative divisions. (he begins pacing the aisles) A man is shot with a bullet equals fact. A car crashes into a telephone pole equals fact. Tears are wet, fire is hot, ice is cold, fact, fact, and fact. You have no facts son, you have skepticism and the world is not run that way and neither is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This may be the wrong Unit for you. Maybe you should transfer to Cyber Division and handle internet Fraud? You know where they’re stationed? (changing tones) Do you wanna know where they’re stationed? You want to be in the criminal investigative division? This division? You need to do some criminal investigating. You need to get tangible evidence. So let me say it one more time, Mikey, and I hope you can contain your tears. Don’t bother us again with speculation—get some facts. (he heads toward the door) Now all of you go turn your teeth into fucking fangs and start making some arrests. cut TO:
