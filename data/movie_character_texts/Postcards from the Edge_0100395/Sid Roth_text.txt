Clearly this woman was caught mid-something for the apparent emergency. She is DORIS MANN, about 60, formerly beautiful and more than some- what currently. She was an enormous star in the 50's and 60's and bears that mark. o She is currently very upset, theatrically so. Cutting a wide swath as she makes her way down the hall -- things dropping out of her purse, mostly makeup ~- a pack of cigarettes. People watch her as she moves by moving aside to avoid impact. Doris Mann is very up- set. Perhaps she has lost a shoe.

Where is Doris?

She looks startled and vulnerable as Suzanne enters -- her eyes fill with tears. When she talks, she sounds very childlike and unaffected. Pearl sits on the bed near her looking victorious and smug.
