30) 41) dialog: I should never have told you.
30) 43) dialog: Brave? Right. Because it's such a long shot. ‘Cause you could never love me back.

34) 31) dialog: Just like that? She just marched right up to you between scenes and blew her wad? Or did you nose it out of her?
34) 34) dialog: I meant it at the time. I do!
