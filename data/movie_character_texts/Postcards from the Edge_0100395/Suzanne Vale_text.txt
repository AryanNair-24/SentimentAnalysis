25) 40) dialog: {continuing; calmer) Look, I may not take criticism well, but that doesn't mean I'm not hearing it. Right now, I'm storing it in my delayed response area, because it's hard for me. Tf wish I was someone who welcomed criticism and immediately understood its value, but I'm not and if I look unhappy about this, Iam. I've had one day of work on this and this is my second conversation about what's missing in my performance.

25) 92) dialog: (stern) The problem, Simon, is that hundreds of people have had conversations with me concerning my low enjoyment levels and my nose... and... and it bothered me. I would prefer to receive direction solely from you. Simon looks concerned and the wind almost blows off his straw hat. .
25) 94) dialog: I mean, we're talking about one day of work here. A scene where I was tied to a cactus and assaulted by snakes all day. As if I were a child! I mean, why don't I give them my mother's phone number? She can stand by and make sure I'm relaxed! Simon snaps his fingers. (CONTINUED)
