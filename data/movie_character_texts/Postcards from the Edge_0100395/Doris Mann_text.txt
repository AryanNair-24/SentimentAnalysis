6) 0) text: A woman is running down the hallway, wailing, every~ thing flying -~ purse, wig askew, blouse untucked, false eyelashes removed. Clearly this woman was caught mid-something for the apparent emergency. She is DORIS MANN, about 60, formerly beautiful and more than some- what currently. She was an enormous star in the 50's and 60's and bears that mark. o She is currently very upset, theatrically so. Cutting a wide swath as she makes her way down the hall -- things dropping out of her purse, mostly makeup ~- a pack of cigarettes. People watch her as she moves by moving aside to avoid impact. Doris Mann is very up- set. Perhaps she has lost a shoe.
6) 1) dialog: My baby, my baby. She is breathless. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM ~ SEVERAL HOURS LATER 1z Suzanne is unconscious following her procedure. She is still being monitored. An IV runs into her arm. Suzanne's mother, Doris Mann, has flung herself across her daughter's inert form. There is something childlike about Doris at the same time as she is theatrical. She is far from a monster as many stars from her generation have been depicted. She is tough, but at the same time, touching, almost adorable. She is a product of complete self-invention. Dirt poor to rich and famous. Though the following has a touch of theatricality about it, almost as though "done" for the two nurses ~~ there should be no doubt about Doris' sincere feelings and concern for Suzanne. Several NURSES try to comfort her.
6) 3) dialog: (not hearing, interrupting) How did this happen? I was a good mother. I had my career, but I was there. She had a happy childhood. I can prove it -- I have films. (CONTINUED )

7) 141) dialog: Are you black?
8) 1) dialog: She seems very unusual. What did she say about blacks? Doris throws her bag on the bed and pulls out a pack of cigarettes. She looks around for an ashtray.

8) 11) dialog: First, I don't think that this is a pivotal project in your career; two, you're going to need time to rest and explore; and C, I think you should change agents. f don't like what they're doing for you. Careers need planning. Your problem is you're too impatient. You're only interested in instant gratification.
8) 13) dialog: (not hearing her) But I don't want you to think about any of this now. I'm handling everything while you're in here. No pressure. I want you to feel absolutely clear -- nothing hanging over your head. Doris' eyes suddenly fill with tears.
8) 14) dialog: (continuing) Oh dear, look at me. I promised myself I wouldn't do this and now look. I didn't want you to see me upset. I hate getting upset. Tf just hate for you to go through this is all. I wish I could do it for you. I never wanted you to go through any pain. I tried so hard to shield you, protect you. I always worried that I'd lose you. That you'd be taken from me early.
8) 16) dialog: Golly, are you tough. Just Like Grandma. Always judging me. You've never forgiven me -~ 31. 17 (CONTINUED )
8) 20) dialog: You never let me talk, do you?

12) 8) dialog: We know that, dear. But these are businessmen who have no knowledge of creative personalities, Actors are not treated well, and actresses are treated like... Well, I hate to say the word, but... shit. Why, I remember when I was fifteen years old, Mr. Mayer called me in for a meeting and he was on the toilet, and we had to conduct the meeting with him on the toilet. You can be sure he wouldn't have done that to John Garfield.
12) 12) dialog: of course. She'll listen to you ~- you're not her mother. (CONTINUED)
12) 20) dialog: What comes around goes around, dear.

12) 35) dialog: She's just like me when I was her age. I did film after film. T never stopped. It was wonderful therapy after my divorce and my Miscarriages. O£ course, in those days, the material was better. (to Suzanne) I think, dear, to do a cop film at this point in your career is a poor choice. You've just done an interesting political film; don't you think now it would be wiser to relax and compose yourself like Julie suggests?
12) 40) dialog: You can have your old room.

17) 14) dialog: You're a poet. "A fan, Miss Mann." You're a poet like my daughter. Have you heard my daughter talk yet? She's so verbal. Oh, of course, you've heard her talk; you're working with her.
17) 16) dialog: I'm embarrassing my daughter. She hates when I taik.
17) 20) dialog: Bye-bye, all.

18) 8) dialog: I knew it. I knew you shouldn't do this film.

18) 11) dialog: (continuing) I know you don't take my dreams seriously; not even the one that predicted your kidney stone. You know, I had a dream the other night that I was drowning. Sinking to the bottom of the ocean, with a heavy sequined dress dragging me down,
18) 13) dialog: I'm not trying to alarm you, dear, Ifm just trying to prepare you. You know, I didn't want to tell you before, ‘cause you were in the Clinic and all that, but you know the hysterectomy I had?

18) 27) dialog: {not hearing her) It's important you understand how precious your life is. I left you my emeralds and the rehearsal hall in my will, so when I die, I can look down from heaven and watch you pay off your house. Although if you keep spending money like you do, I'm not going to leave you anything. Or if I do I'll leave it to you in trust.
18) 29) dialog: You should let Dr. Feldman look at you; maybe you have tumors. I had one the size of a grapefruit. (sighs) My own daughter won't even listen to me. If only you'd change back to my business manager, I bet you'd feel better. I certainly would.
18) 33) dialog: Don't even say that in jest, darling. Particularly right after you've gotten out of a drug Clinic. People might take it the wrong way.
19) 0) text: Doris and Suzanne drive up. Many cars are in the driveway. It looks as though there's a party going on.
19) 2) dialog: Surprise! I thought I'd invite a few people over to celebrate your coming home.

20) 2) dialog: {calls) My little girl is home!!! About twenty people or so stand around. Mostly friends of Doris. Also her friend Aretha from the clinic. Suzanne looks mortified. Her grandparents are there, PEARL and OWEN, as is her housekeeper/nanny, MARY, a black woman about the same age as her mother. Her grandmother is seventy-five. Suzanne's stepfather, Sid Roth, sits drinking and watching television. Sid essentially never speaks. Suzanne's grandmother, Pearl, is an extremely critical woman. Her grandfather, Owen, has the beginnings of Alzheimer's Disease, and doesn't quite know where he is, but has a general idea that he wishes that his wife (or whoever she is) wasn't there too.

23) 0) text: Suzanne is standing next to the piano, singing. Doris' accompanist, ROGER, accompanies. Her voice is soulful, beautiful. She holds onto the piano for dear life. She is almost visibly trembling. She keeps her eyes trained on the ground. Doris’ face is a mixture of emotions from pride to envy. Sometimes she mouths the words to the song with her daughter. She occasionally shushes the other guests, even if they aren't talking. As Suzanne fin- ishes her ballad, Doris is in tears. Suzanne is miser- able. She finishes and gives her mother a helpless, caught look. The song she sings is a baliad like "If I Loved You," "Skylark" or "Better Luck Next Time," a yearning, sad song.
23) 4) dialog: That was lovely, dear. I don't know why you don't sing anymore.
23) 6) dialog: But you shouldn't be. You've got a terrific voice -- a terrific talent -~ a much bigger talent than mine. Now Gary starts another chant.
23) 8) dialog: No, no I couldn't. Really, it's my daughter's night.
23) 10) dialog: (to Suzanne) You think I should?
23) 12) dialog: All right. You sang for me; I'1l sing for you. (to Roger) "Gee But It's Good To Be Here" -- in A~flat. Doris wows them with her song, completely eclipsing Suzanne. She is a true performer -~ loving it, born to do it. Nerves of steel, she plays completely to the crowd. Suzanne watches. The room is electrified, whipped up as they can only be in the face of a great and true entertainer. (CONTINUED )

I've stood in bread lines with the best, Watched while the headlines did the rest. In the depression, was I depressed? Nowhere near. IZ got through all of last year, and I'm here. She finishes on top of the piano, the assembled company cheering. We HOLD on Suzanne's happyr defeated face. Doris casts a long shadow.
27) 2) dialog: Hello. May I help you?
27) 4) dialog: Jack. I'm Suzanne's mother. Was she expecting you?
27) 8) dialog: Come in, come in. f'11 call her. I'm sorry if I seem rude, but you know how protective mothers can « be. Did you say you had a ranch?

27) 12) dialog: I know what you mean. I have actually known her a long time though. Her whole life. She's an interesting woman, don't you think? Authentic. Last month you met her?

27) 13) dialog: (continuing) Oh, good morning, dear. This is my husband, Sid Roth; Sid, this is Suzanne's little friend, Jim.

28) 6) dialog: Dear, you're tired. You didn't get a lot of sleep.
28) 13) dialog: (interrupts) I didn't lift up my skirt, dear, it twirled up. You only remember the bad stuff, don't you, dear? What about the big band I got that played at that party? Do you remember that? No. You just remember that my skirt accidentally twirled up and that --
28) 15) dialog: I haven't overshadowed you! What have I done to deserve such a bitter daughter? It twirled up, Tf tell you! And that fellow just got here ~~ I was just coming to get you! And I don't care if he likes me or not!
28) 17) dialog: You always had to marry such shits. Why couldn't you have married that nice boy that wanted to marry you? That what's-his- name that I liked so much. (CONTINUED)
28) 21) dialog: Stories about you as a little girl! -~ and some stories about Hollywood -~ He asked me to tell them. At least Wally was a gentleman and not some sort of Make-out artist like your friend out there. With bedroom eyes.

31) 1) dialog: (evenly) Have you any idea what time it is, dear? Suzanne jumps, startled.
31) 3) dialog: I suppose it never occurred to you that you might have scared me by staying out so late. I was about to call all the emergency rooms.
31) 9) dialog: What if you had taken drugs or something? I'm supposed to be taking care of you now. You're my responsibility. You're my daughter. What was I supposed to think when you didn't come home? Doris starts pouring herself another glass of wine. She looks up to see Suzanne watching her.
31) 10) dialog: (continuing) Do you mind if I have a drink?
31) 12) dialog: Dear, I drink socially.
31) 14) dialog: I hardly think my drinking can be compared with your drug taking, dear. And even if it could be, I think your involvement with drugs has vindicated me. I hardly think you're in a position to judge me.
31) 16) dialog: I hope you weren't out sleeping with someone.
31) 18) dialog: Well, if you were, I hope you used condoms. I didn't bring you up to act this way, but I hope if you are, that your morals are in question and not your judgment. (CONTINUED )

I just want you to like me. I just want to be your friend.
31) 30) dialog: Well, you can accuse me of many things, but not of not being your mother. What is the thing that annoys you about me? Isn't it that I mother you? You know, dear, it's very hard to have a conversation with you. Do you hear how you're talking to me? Like I'm a moron.
31) 36) dialog: Every time I try to get close to you, you push me away... How would you like to have Joan Crawford for a mother? Or Lana Turner? I think you had it pretty good.
31) 38) dialog: You'll never Eorgive me for falling under the pressures of life. For not living up to the standards I set for myself. For being the person I am in your looking-glass, for not remaining that person ~- so I broke under the money pressure. If it wasn't for you, I would've killed myself.
31) 40) dialog: Just know how much I love you. Oh, I know, maybe you needed a different mother, one that baked cookies. I don't knit, I don't embroider, but I have always tried to give you the best and you throw it away. I came from nothing and made something out of my life. You came from somewhere and are trying to make nothing out of yours. You're going to have to get over what happened to you in your adolescence, dear. It's time £0 move on. Suzanne looks at her mother for an odd beat. There is some truth to what she says.
31) 41) dialog: (continuing) I want you to like me.
31) 45) dialog: That's for darn sure. Doris and Suzanne gaze at one another.

38) 20) dialog: I'm telling you everything I know, dear. I, of course, have contacted your stepfather's lawyer, Samuel Stone, who's terrific, and so he's on it now. But I’m afraid for the moment there's nothing more that we can do.
38) 26) dialog: Not broke, per se. Your salary for this film is still in escrow, pending your completing it without a hitch =~ thank God, and, of course, you have your New York apartment, that you own outright, | thanks to me. JI£ I'd left it up to Mort, the bank would own that place and then you'd really be strapped.
38) 28) dialog: It's no good feeling sorry for yourself, dear. You'll have to overcome these difficulties and you might as well do it with some style. You know, you could easily make an enormous amount of money if you'd only sing. You have a God-given talent that you just throw away. You could be as big a star as that... that Madonna girl. She hasn't got half your voice. I keep telling you, if you would only make an album, I could produce it. We could make one of those videos. Suzanne has heard this speech before and it drives her crazy. She might mouth some of the words as her mother recites them.
38) 30) dialog: Now let's take this one thing at a time. (MORE) (CONTINUED )
38) 34) dialog: First, everyone is always getting out of the business, and B, you're just like me. Some days I wake up and feel like I'm talking to my armpit.

38) 38) dialog: No, you don't say it; you're even too smart to think it. But, you feel it. You somehow lay the entire blame of your drug taking on me.
38) 40) dialog: Oh, sure, that's your logical brain telling you that, but in your heart you feel that I'm an... alcoholic and that's what's to blame for your... weakness, isn't it? silent.
38) 41) dialog: Go ahead, say it -- you think I'm an alcoholic! (CONTINUED)
38) 45) dialog: Well, maybe I was an alcoholic -- when you were a teenager. I had a. nervous breakdown when my marriage failed and I lost all that money. But I got over it. Now I just drink like an Irish person--
38) 47) dialog: Don't be fresh.
38) 49) dialog: Maybe you're just jealous, cause I gan drink and you can't take drugs anymore. I can handle it and you can't.
38) 51) dialog: (interrupts) My drinking doesn’t interfere with my work, like it did with you. My drinking doesn't interfere with my life.

That time with the dress -- I'm ashamed of that. But what can I do? So, I made some mistakes, I'm human. You've never forgiven me for not being the perfect mother you thought you had before you were a teenager -- before my breakdown. eyes fill. This is true.
38) 78) dialog: I£ I did wrong giving you those pills, I'm sorry. How was I to know? We didn't have self-help books then like they do now. The only place I had to learn from was my own childhood. (CONTINUED)
