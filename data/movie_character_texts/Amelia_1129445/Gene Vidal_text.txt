59) 1) dialog: Transcontinental was too ambitious. Too many hops, too tough on the ladies. But the shuttle...
59) 3) dialog: Washington, New York, Boston. I think it's the future. Will you go there with us?
59) 6) text: She's making a real mess of the lobster.    Gene notices. COLLINS doesn't...
59) 8) text: Gene reaches over, as if it were his own plate, and begin cracking her lobster for her. She looks in his eyes and tries to concentrate.

59) 24) dialog: Oh, fine.
59) 26) dialog: Actually, she hasn't been feeling her best. She'll probably summer in Newport. So my kid's stuck with Dad again.
59) 33) dialog: You suggesting you're less boring than I am?
59) 38) dialog: Gore would love that. He has a little crush, I'm afraid.
59) 40) dialog: He's eight.
59) 45) dialog: The next adventure.    What is it?
59) 47) dialog: Because we're running out of oceans.
59) 54) dialog: I'm serious, Amelia.
59) 57) dialog: The only way you can stay where you are. And be who you are...
59) 59) dialog: Is to keep feeding the beast.
59) 61) dialog: And the beast always needs something larger, greater, more daring... AMELIA (quiet) He costs money, too.
59) 62) dialog: The price of fame, literally. Do you and George talk about this?
59) 65) dialog: With all respect.    Yes, you do.
63) 11) text: PAN to Gene at his side.   Sober.   Distinguished.   Prou
64) 0) text: 66 A taxi slowly pulls up to the home we know. Warmly lit, music playing from within. Gene climbs from the cab, as y lights go ON. As Gene starts up the path, the front door opens and Amel BURSTS into the night, RUNNING to Gene, JUMPING INTO his arms, HUGGING him in her delight. We PULL BACK to... George watching it all from the doorway.    His easy smil seems comfortably in place, as... ...Amelia walks Gene up the path, her arm around his wais talking excitedly, flushed as a schoolgirl. As they reach the door... George is the picture of calm and dignity. He beams and CLASPS Gene's hand. Throws an arm around his shoulder as Amelia leads them inside. The door closes.   We hear laughter.

70) 0) text: 73 Dark little piano bar. They sit in a quiet corner, com- fortable in silence. Gene with his martini, Amelia with h Coke. She's shelling peanuts from a bowl, popping some in her mouth, passing a few over to him.
70) 10) dialog: If you don't drink, why do you come o bars?
70) 12) dialog: What worries me is, in some of these bars the nuts are the ambience. Specially when they make a pass at you.
70) 15) dialog: You keep advertising that, but I'm still waiting to see it.
70) 18) dialog: Well, here's your chance. I'm taking Gore to the conference in Bermuda. He wants you to come.
70) 20) dialog: Sure.   I'm completely indifferent.
70) 35) dialog: That's a wonderful idea. Especially now.
70) 38) dialog: A good time for some positive press about you as a role model.
70) 40) dialog: You don't read the papers?
70) 42) dialog: Well, someone should. Because they're all saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose except publicity. Meaning, money.
70) 78) dialog: Look, George had you taking money rom the sugar cartel for the Hawaii flight, the Mexican Government for theirs, he's selling commemorative stamps which you carried on the flights...
70) 80) dialog: I'm sorry I said it that way. This s actually about you, because I'm picking a fight, apparently a useless one, for the benefit of someone I care about.
70) 84) dialog: If you want to make money, my guess s that people viewing you as Lady Lindy, America's Sweetheart of the Skies, the wife/mother/daughter they all wished they had. Would be helpful.
70) 86) dialog: Thanks for not being defensive.
70) 102) text: Walks out.       Gene makes no move to follow.   He's sai piece.
76) 0) text: The LOCKHEED ELECTRA, a sleek state-of-the-art aircraft w its gleaming metallic surface, nose up in the center of a huge space. Its engines are on hoists, being worked on by team of MECHANICS. Eight-year-old Gore gazes up, as if he has never seen anything quite so wondrous. Amelia and Gene watch, with barely suppressed smiles. He's in a suit. She's in grease stained overalls from working with the mechanics.
76) 8) dialog: There are men who say they flew around the world, but they didn't ly around all of it.
76) 33) dialog: Ask her about the Pacific. The maximum range of the Electra is 4000 miles. And the closest land est of Honolulu is farther than that.
76) 57) text: HOLD on Gene.   He smiles at his kid...
76) 58) dialog: Go out to the car and get Sara. Ask if she'll take you for an ice cream. Okay?
76) 61) text: Okay, then. He waves. One more glance at dad, and Gore goes. Gene gestures for Amelia to come with him, away fro the mechanics. What's up? But he's already walking to... ...a little folding table, off in a corner.     She follo Sits. Well...?       G
76) 66) dialog: The only good thing about losing our former relationship is I feel a little freer to tell you when you're being completely crazy.
76) 69) dialog: You're not a good enough pilot to o mid-air refueling. You will not be able to control the Electra or that docking maneuver for that amount of time.
76) 84) dialog: I've noticed. Don't be so proud of it.
76) 86) dialog: This is Howland Island. It's half- way between Honolulu and New Guinea. It has no elevation, no trees, it's a mile wide and a mile and a half long. Hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists.
76) 88) dialog: We're colonizing it, because when the Japanese make their move, we're going to need a refueling strip there.
76) 90) dialog: Try reading the newspapers between he lines. We haven't started building the runways yet. Maybe if someone I knew could get the President's attention...
76) 92) dialog: It's really tiny, a grain of sand n the middle of a thousand miles f nowhere.
76) 94) dialog: F You'd need a first-class navigator or that leg. Which means the trip can't be entirely solo.
76) 96) dialog: Can you handle that?
84) 16) text: The whirr and clang of tools. Amelia and George confer wi one foreman, as George sees something. He touches her arm points in our direction. REVERSE ANGLE as she sees... ...Gene has entered the hangar.    Stands by the folding we've seen before.

84) 20) dialog: Thanks for letting me come.
84) 21) text: As they sit, Gene looks from one to the other.
84) 22) dialog: I guess I'm already outvoted.
84) 24) text: Gene's smile can't mask the concern in his eyes.
84) 26) dialog: But you're flying Howland last, when you're exhausted.
84) 30) text: Gene nods, slowly.    His eyes still locked on her.
84) 36) dialog: Maybe I'm obsessing on Howland because it was my bright idea, and I'd feel responsible if...
84) 38) dialog: I'd appreciate that.
84) 40) dialog: You miss that island. You'll be out of fuel, with 2000 miles to go.
84) 45) dialog: You and Fred alone for a month...
