1) 5) dialog: We'll see if I remember how to edit.
1) 12) dialog: I'd kept her waiting two hours. T She hated me on sight, but she hought I couldn't tell.
1) 14) dialog: She was a person who cherished her privacy and was devoting her life to social work. And there I was...
1) 16) dialog: Self-obsessed. Wallowing in the glory of my authors and celebrity acquaintances. A vain, fast- talking, manipulator. But then I guess you know all that, don't you?
1) 18) dialog: Oh, yes. And the kind of man who fishes for compliments.
2) 1) dialog: The waiting made her furious. She undoubtedly felt I was E stablishing my dominance and importance.
2) 8) dialog: Actually, I hadn't given her a thought. Oblivious as usual. Which, perhaps, was even worse.
2) 9) text: Now, SKYWARD by ADM. RICHARD BYRD. Photos of the explorer preparing for his flight over the North Pole. One of Byrd with George himself, displaying considerable gravitas.
2) 11) text: Her eye travels over the stack of books. Adventurers, explorers, celebrities. On an end table, a framed photo o George with the great Lindbergh. A pretty SECRETARY comes to summon her. Amelia rises, smooths the wrinkles from her brown suit. They head down the corridor.
2) 13) text: They reach the door, already ajar. It says GEORGE PALMER PUTNAM on a small bronze plate. The secretary gingerly pushes it open... ...revealing George on the phone in crisp shirtsleeves an suspenders. He paces, prowls, trailing the cord behind hi negotiating non-stop even as he flips through a pile of messages. Off again, stalking the room. Dashing, electric masterful.

2) 28) dialog: I'm told you want to fly the Atlantic Ocean.
2) 30) dialog: In the 12 months since Lindbergh, 55 people in 18 planes have tried. Three planes made it. Fourteen people have died.
2) 32) dialog: Three women died trying. Two others escaped with their lives. If you do make it, you'd be the first. Which...is the real attraction for both of us, I suspect.
2) 41) dialog: The plane was bought from Adm. Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite who wanted the record for herself. Her family wouldn't tolerate the danger. She has asked for a replacement...

2) 45) dialog: Because she wants the world to pay attention. And pretty girls command more attention.
2) 47) dialog: Sure. My role is selling this event to the public. There will be a contract for the girl's story with the New York Times. Also a book to be published over her name.
2) 51) dialog: Which will be as great as I can manage, I assure you.
2) 53) dialog: Don't get your hopes up. The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be the pilot. There'll be a male co- pilot and navigator. The woman will be purely a passenger.
2) 59) dialog: That's good for your chances. Because your level of flying experience wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would be considered for this. If the woman were to do any flying at all.
2) 62) dialog: Because the hook is that we're making the woman the commander. The pilot will sign a contract saying he is under her direction and control. It's her ship, her flight.
2) 64) dialog: The job's yours.
2) 66) dialog: I chose you the moment you walked through the door.
2) 68) dialog: Now assuming my awful manners haven't soured you on the enterprise. May I give you a lift to the station?
3) 1) dialog: I honestly feel an apology is in order.
3) 5) dialog: I mean an apology.   For what's coming.
3) 7) dialog: I'm going to be pretty controlling these next few months. How you dress, move, cut your hair. Speak in public. It's all part of the package we're selling.
3) 9) dialog: That's right. If you're not in there selling with me, it won't work.
