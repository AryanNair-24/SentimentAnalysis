Barbara comes from the kitchen with mor jars, drying them on the outside and putting them on the table. She and Helen begin working the kerosene soaked fuses through holes which Tom has cut in the jar lids. Between them is a crude stretcher, made of broomsticks an torn sheets, this presumable for the wounded girl, Karen.

Tom is soaking a table-leg in kerosene, ready to light it for use as a torch. They fall to work on the door ... the painstaking work of quietly undoing the barricade. They do not want t give alarm to the lurking things outside. With crowbar an claw-hammer, very carefully, both men working on each separate piece of lumber, they undo the barricade. Each nail-creak is a menace. They are alert to the constant danger. They finish, and watch, posting themselves anxiously by t door. Shadowy figures lurk in the dark outside. Tom and Ben wait for the Molotov shower to begin A cry is heard, a window flies open, the first fiery blaz light in the yard. More follow, some aimed for the creatures themselves. One of two catch fire.. the others start to back away ... the entire field is lit up bombs shower from upstairs.

Overwhelming mood of hopelessness and despair. Harry sulks in a corner, his head slung back, his face swollen, he is holding an ice- pack against his eye. His good eye follows Ben, who is pacing about the room, when Ben’s pacing takes him to the kitchen, or to some area out of Harry’s sight, the good e nervously relaxes. Ben’s movements make virtually the onl sound, he is checking the defenses, by force of old habit rather than hope. The rifle is slung on his back. For a long time, we well on the scene, on the absolute dejectedness of the prisoners within the barricaded house ... Ben paces from door to kitchen to window, he starts to go upstairs, stops, checks himself, goes to the door again ... he looks at his watch 79.

(We see his view of the outside) There are many ghouls, lurking in the shadows of the hanging trees. Some of the things are in the open, much nearer to the house than they dared come before. Remains of charred bodies are dimly apparent in various parts of the lawn. But Ben’s eyes are fastened on a more grisly scene at the edge of the lawn, in the moonlight, several ghouls are devouring what was once Tom ... . They rip and tear into aspects of his body ... .. ghoulish teeth biting into Tom’s arms and hands ... Ben stares fascinated ... and repulsed With a convulsive movement his fingers release the curtai he turns, shaken, and faces the others ... beads of perspiration dripping from his forehead.

The posse is flushing out ghouls from the pump-house and surrounding area. The squad cars have driven up. The posse is advancing across the lawn, guardedly, toward the partiall destroyed old farmhouse. The men crouch and sneak up slowly, keeping their eyes fastened on the house.... A lo sudden noise stops them ... they watch, stopped in their tracks.
