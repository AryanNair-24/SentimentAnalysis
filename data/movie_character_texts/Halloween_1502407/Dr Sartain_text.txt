1) 16) dialog: Good afternoon. I'm Dr. Ranbir Sartain.
1) 20) dialog: Glass Hill is the pit of hell.                        Underfunded and short staffed. For years he has been kept here to be studied. I suppose the state has lost interest in discovering anything further.
1) 26) dialog: 
2) 5) dialog: I've examined every case file written on him. I was a scholar of Dr. Loomis before he passed away. Then I lobbied the University of Illinois to be assign to Michael                      myself.
2) 11) dialog: He has been seen by over 50 clinical psychiatrists. And with each, many different opinions. Loomis reasoned that he was nothing more than pure evil.
2) 15) dialog: Evil is not a diagnosis. Under my care, we implemented a holistic form of therapy. Since that time, his tendency for violence has essentially been erased.
2) 19) dialog: We left two kitty cats in his cell overnight and both remained unharmed.
2) 26) dialog: Michael Myers is an evolving, aging creature like we all are. And although we have worked very closely with him, these halls display the limitations of my analysis. Loomis saw Michael as a            beast in the wild. He witnessed human behavior at its most primal, while the rest of us only have the opportunity of observation in captivity.
3) 3) dialog: Our patients get fresh air and sunshine, a view, proper exercise, a healthy diet. It pains me to see                     him transferred to a less than                         desirable' facility.
3) 10) dialog: Make no mistake. He is aware. He was watching you as you arrived. When he's not out here in the courtyard, he walks from this window to that window, to the other. Observing things.
3) 13) dialog: 
3) 19) dialog: Step up to the yellow line. No further. Do not pass the line under any circumstance.
3) 23) dialog: Michael. I have some people who would like to meet you.
19) 25) dialog: Don't worry, Michael. I'll be by your side.
20) 16) dialog: Michael Myers is my patient until he is in somebody else's care. I'm seeing my duty through till the end.
23) 60) dialog: Don't shoot.
25) 19) dialog: 
25) 26) dialog: Did he... Did he escape?
68) 42) dialog: Where is he?
68) 50) dialog: The bus lost control after Michael overtook the first guard, then the driver. He is no longer dormant. I saw him kill with my own eyes. He only knows how to keep moving and to keep killing and he will kill again unless he is captured.
68) 56) dialog: I tried to hide, but he found me. Locked me to a seat. He looked down at me. I closed my eyes and when I opened them, he walked away.
68) 78) dialog: Excuse me, officers.
68) 85) dialog: I'm Michael's doctor. Ranbir Sartain.
68) 89) dialog: I've read everything about you in his case files. Do you know our friend Mr. Hawkins here was the responding deputy when Michael was apprehended in 1978?
68) 92) dialog: He lawfully stood between doctor Loomis' vindictive tirade and the right to a fair trial.
68) 111) dialog: Will you come with us?
71) 5) dialog: There are many ways for tragedy to change a victim. They can grow accustomed to always being afraid. They can become weak or they can become strong. But there is also the other side.
71) 9) dialog: The core of the victimizer. This is                    what has intrigued me through my studies. How does a crime like Michael's change him? What is he feeling? Is he on a random path or is he emotionally driven? Triggered by something. Some unheard marching                    order imprinted on his very being? Evil incarnate. Michael and I had a special connection, but without his verbal participation there was a side of his mad journey that I could never understand.
71) 15) dialog: Tell me what become of his childhood home.
79) 7) dialog: He's alive.
79) 12) dialog: Officer Hawkins, do not kill my patient.
79) 31) dialog: Don't move, Young lady. Do not scream. Stay where you are.
82) 11) dialog: 
82) 18) dialog: Make room, my dear. Mindful of my patient. (to The Shape)
82) 20) dialog: Are you with us, Michael? Are you listening?
83) 5) dialog: Michael, I see why you are who you are. The sensation is obvious. The thrill is exhilarating. Loomis was a coward. He was afraid to travel to such depths for you. But I love you and I know you feel the same way. I freed you from those unwilling to understand you. Those of archaic mind.
83) 10) dialog: The look on your face when you saw                     freedom? And then the carnage and confusion we created?                                 
83) 15) dialog: I'm glad we're together, Michael.
84) 3) dialog: What greater spectacle than to reunite two old friends. Michael Myers and Laurie Strode. A historical reunion.
84) 6) dialog: Michael. She's been waiting for you. Are you ready?
86) 11) dialog: But you said I could watch.
86) 14) dialog: Do it.
