7) 182) dialog: (with certainty)
7) 185) dialog: Morboso is like... when you can't stop thinking about something. He stares back at her: wordless.

8) 1) dialog: My friend Anna. This is my friend Signor Farfalla. CLARA's eyes twinkle mischievously. The girls cease to hold hands and ANNA offers hers to JAC JACK half rises like the perfect gentlemen, folding his newspaper and accepting ANNA's greeting.
8) 5) text: Will you take a coffee with me? CLARA
8) 7) text: Prego. CLARA moves her chair to sit closer to JACK. Under the ta her knee presses against his. ANNA also moves her chair nearer to JACK: but her motive to move it out of the sun. She is not flirting. CLARA
8) 10) text: But you are... She looks at CLARA. ANNA

9) 57) dialog: Si.
9) 59) dialog: Una botiglia di acqua minerale non gasata et... una Parasini, per favore. Completely ignoring her, the WAITER addresses JACK with a wink.
9) 63) dialog: (to the WAITER)
9) 67) text: Gasata? CLARA
9) 68) text: Non gasata. He nods with some genuine deference and leaves. CLARA sighs. CLARA
9) 70) text: Small towns. JACK smiles. CLARA smiles back. They have this contempt i common. The WAITER reappears and pours a thumbful of wine. It is red in colour and frizzante. At CLARA's insistence, JACK tastes it. It is dry and has a tar-like aftertaste. CLARA
9) 72) text: It is. Very good. He looks at her and- for a brief moment- he undergoes wha a unique experience for him: a positive longing to repeat this brief moment many times in the future. CLARA catches the glow of his warmth and blossoms. CLARA
9) 74) text: Sure. CLARA
9) 78) text: I doubt any of the couples here are. With the exception of the Germans at table seven. She's wearing a wedding ring and they haven't spoken a word to each other for eight and half minutes. CLARA

9) 82) text: He thinks we are a couple. JACK signals to the GYPSY and buys CLARA a ROSE. JACK
9) 83) text: Why spoil the illusion? She looks at him and smiles. CLARA
9) 85) text: Buona sera. Desidera? CLARA orders, full of Italian charm, putting JACK at his ease. He watches her contentedly: the way she talks and moves.
9) 89) dialog: Woooow!
9) 92) dialog: Bitchin'.
9) 94) dialog: It's- come se dice- `slang', no? Eco.

9) 105) text: Sure. Bastardo. Imbecile. CLARA
9) 107) text: Eat shit and die, pimple dick? CLARA hiccups. CLARA
9) 109) text: I guess I've led a sheltered life. Of sorts. CLARA
9) 111) text: Too much work. CLARA's CELL PHONE starts to ring. It's on silent, but th screen is flashing, just visible where it sticks out of h handbag. CLARA looks down at the phone. CLARA

9) 134) dialog: Stronzo! I buy you a present! She fishes about in her handbag... ...and produces a SILVER BOX. JACK unwraps the shiny paper. Inside is a plastic case li the sort you put engagement rings in. Inside the case is BADGE, hand-painted, depicting the symbol of the region: eagle of L'Aquila. JACK sticks the BADGE in his lapel.
9) 137) dialog: Prego. Eduardo. A pause.
9) 138) dialog: My apartment is not far from here.
9) 175) dialog: Ciao, Eduardo!

9) 187) dialog: A pick-nick! We are going for a pick-nick. Just the two of us. She looks at him.

9) 192) dialog: Is it more far?
9) 195) dialog: Twelve kilometres? In twenty minutes?

10) 0) text: CLARA is startled by such an insignificant track.
10) 1) dialog: Where are we going? Now she's anxious. This is not what she expected.
10) 3) dialog: I think it is good we should stay close to the road.
10) 6) text: You're not afraid of coming into the wild with me, are you? CLARA
10) 7) text: No! She laughs tensely. CLARA

10) 9) text: ...sentiero! She waves her hand in the air. CLARA
10) 12) text: This was made by the French for taking potatoes to market. Besides, I always come here in this car. CLARA
10) 14) text: Of course. I don't want to walk back to town any more than you do. CLARA
10) 18) text: Now there is no road! JACK stops the car and turns the engines off. Sudden silence. CLARA lets go of the seat. CLARA
10) 21) text: You won't need to hold on. I'll go slowly. Just relax and look. He eases his foot off the brake and the car begins to mov forward, the springs squeaking slightly. After 50 metres twists the steering wheel slightly and applies the brakes They roll gradually down to the outer edge of the woods a come to a stop beneath a familiarly squat but ample WALNU TREE. Beyond them is the LAKE, the MEADOWS and the RUINED HAMLE The hidden valley is a riot of colour, the blooms and blossoms more brilliant than we've ever seen them. By the edge of the lake stands a HERON, still as fence post. CLARA gets out of the car, dumbstruck. JACK gets out too. watches her... then swiftly checks the ruined hamlet thro his miniature binoculars. Deserted. By the time CLARA tur towards him, the binoculars are hidden. CLARA
10) 23) text: No. CLARA
10) 27) text: Well? She is coquettish- and tosses her auburn hair to one side CLARA
10) 29) text: There are vipers! Vipera! Marasso! CLARA
10) 30) text: Maybe! But I am lucky! The HERON flies off, rising from the reeds with an ungain flapping. CLARA
10) 31) text: (shouting) He is an Italian bird! We disturb his siesta! Quickly, JACK glances inside the CITROEN. The RED PURSE is nowhere to be seen. CLARA
10) 32) text: Come, Signor Farfalla! JACK undresses. As he removes his clothes, he stalls for time, using the cover of undressing to search for the RED PURSE. We can see it wedged under the passenger seat. Due to the design of the car, JACK cannot. CLARA
10) 35) text: Stand by me. He obeys her order. He walks out to her and she takes his hand under the water, holding it out in front of them. JACK spots it resting on the smooth stone of the lake-bed Brassy and gleaming. A SPENT SHELL. He covers it with his foot. CLARA
10) 37) text: If we stay here for a year, they'll devour us. CLARA
10) 39) text: Maybe we should... CLARA
10) 41) text: I haven't. She places her arms around his neck and raises her feet f the smooth stones, wrapping her legs around his waist. Sh tries to push herself onto him but he resists. CLARA
10) 46) dialog: Eduardo. JACK looks at her.
10) 47) dialog: Is this your real name? A beat.
10) 49) dialog: Si. Yes. She looks at him. Waiting for his reply.
10) 51) dialog: Ed-ward. She doesn't believe him.
10) 52) dialog: You are sure you are not married, Eduardo?
10) 55) text: Will you put this on my back? She proffers him the SUNTAN LOTION. JACK stares at her baking body, transfixed by its terribl and perfect beauty. Hidden behind the LID of the picnic hamper... ...his trembling right hand grips tightly to his WALTHER. A long pause. CLARA
10) 56) text: Eduardo? He's frozen. CLARA
10) 57) text: Amore? Time seems to stop. ECU on JACK. Suddenly, CLARA sits up. CLARA
10) 70) text: Or maybe I've just found a reason to change. And hands CLARA her shoe. CLARA
10) 72) text: I still don't understand. What's the point of a gun if it's not loaded? CLARA
10) 73) text: One of the girls borrow it to me after the second hooker in Chieti is murdered. With some of the clients it make me feel safe. I don't tell the police, of course, but... Madonna, Eduardo. How they do to these two women! A police agente from Rome show me photographs. They show photographs to everyone in Via Lampedusa. CLARA shivers with disgust. CLARA
10) 75) text: Does the gun make you feel safer with me? CLARA
10) 77) text: Then why's it in your purse? CLARA looks unhappy. CLARA
10) 79) text: Maybe this is suicide. Cops often put the graft on working girls. Perhaps the girl I told you about, Clara, has sold me out. (MORE)
10) 81) text: Maybe she's a cop herself, or maybe she's a hired gun. Then again, maybe Clara is who she says she is and my Belgian clients will take the gun, shoot me themselves and keep the money. Always a risk in my profession. Or perhaps my trusted colleague in Rome no longer trusts me. Perhaps even you, Father, with your connections in Naples... CLARA
10) 83) text: I guess I'll go to work too. CLARA
10) 86) text: It's not that I've given up on life, Father. Just the way that I was living it. If you can call it living. CLARA
10) 88) text: It's time to go home. CLARA
10) 90) text: I can't, Clara. One day... She's upset but decides not to press her demand. JACK (V.O.)
10) 91) text: If I had one request, Father, it would be this. That it's not Clara who finally pulls the trigger. But whoever it is... CLARA kisses him and simply says: CLARA
12) 24) dialog: 
12) 55) dialog: I have to work tonight.
12) 57) dialog: You come to my apartment after.
12) 59) dialog: Come away with you?
12) 62) dialog: Together?
12) 64) dialog: Where?
12) 66) dialog: To live?
12) 68) dialog: Forever?
12) 71) dialog: Other plans? She swears in Italian. Obscenities. Then throws herself around JACK and squeezes him with all her strength. There tears in her eyes.
12) 72) dialog: I love you, Signor Eduardo Farfalla. He looks at her.
12) 78) dialog: What's happening?
12) 81) dialog: Eduardo, please?
12) 83) dialog: I trust you. She wants to, but she doesn't.
12) 85) dialog: No?

12) 92) dialog: (perplexed)
