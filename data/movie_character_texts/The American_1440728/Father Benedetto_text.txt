2) 38) text: Si. FATHER BENEDETTO
2) 40) text: Poco. FATHER BENEDETTO
2) 42) text: Not for much longer. FATHER BENEDETTO
2) 44) text: Working vacation. This much is true- after a fashion. They speak in English unless otherwise specified: FATHER BENEDETTO
2) 46) text: Photographer. FATHER BENEDETTO
2) 48) text: Pictures of the region. Architecture, landscapes... FATHER BENEDETTO
2) 52) dialog: Ah! Magazine! Which magazine? JACK shows no discomfort.
2) 54) dialog: Va bene. So you must share a glass of wine with me. Questa sera. This evening. A beat. JACK is slightly thrown.
2) 56) dialog: Certo. You want to know the truth about Abruzzo? A priest sees everything.
2) 71) text: Que siamo! The quality of the brandy is good, the liquor is smooth and the glass warmed by the sun. He pronounces warmed "war-med". His English is sophistica but quaint, like an out-of-date book. JACK sniffs his drink before he sips it. Not like a connoisseur: like a White House taster checking the safet a Presidential beverage. FATHER BENEDETTO
2) 72) text: (in ENGLISH) The only good thing to come from the Francesi, everything else... FATHER BENEDETTO grimaces. FATHER BENEDETTO
2) 73) text: The French are... pezzi di merda. This is not an American discovery. Italians have known this for centuries. [In ITALIAN] When Rome called France the province of Gaul, they were just the same. Arrogant sensualists. Their cuisine is fussy and their wine effeminate. Only their brandy is worthy of any attention. FATHER BENEDETTO looks at JACK. FATHER BENEDETTO
2) 75) text: No. FATHER BENEDETTO looks horrified. FATHER BENEDETTO
2) 77) text: I take pictures, father. A beat. FATHER BENEDETTO
5) 39) dialog: All the sheep in my flock are dear to me, but some are dearer than most. Especially those that have strayed from the fold. Off JACK's intrigued look FATHER BENEDETTO clarifies:
5) 40) dialog: Fabio. He is a... [in ITALIAN] 'car doctor'. But I suspect his practice is not entirely sound. Ecco! FATHER BENEDETTO whisks the lid off the covered dish revealing a stew of poultry carcasses covered in sauce.
5) 41) dialog: Fagiano. Pheasant. With sauce of orange juice, orange peel, chestnuts, garlic, Marsala wine and... Come si dici in Inglese? Brodo di Pollo. Chicken broth.
5) 43) text: Also: salsify in garlic butter. Mange-tout. Fried wild mushrooms with truffle. JACK helps himself to vegetables. FATHER BENEDETTO watches him as he savours his first tast JACK licks his lips and sips some cold white wine. The two men regard one another, the priest awaiting a verdict. JACK
5) 44) text: Sinful. FATHER BENEDETTO shrugs. FATHER BENEDETTO
5) 46) text: Have you ever wanted to be anything other than a priest? FATHER BENEDETTO
5) 48) text: Photographer? FATHER BENEDETTO
5) 50) text: I do what I'm good at. FATHER BENEDETTO
5) 51) text: I'm sure you have other talents. You have the hands of a craftsman, not an artist. You are good with machines. Yet you told me just the opposite when we first met. JACK hides his unease from the watchful priest. FATHER BENEDETTO
5) 55) dialog: Perhaps you are rich already?
5) 57) dialog: (in ITALIAN)
5) 60) dialog: (in ENGLISH)
5) 63) dialog: "The grave soul keeps its own secrets, and takes its own punishment in silence." He has a twinkle in his eye. The priest is on a mission t extract the truth... and JACK knows it.
7) 202) dialog: I've been looking for you.
7) 204) dialog: A man was here asking questions about you.
7) 207) dialog: He came to the church this afternoon.
7) 212) text: And you told him? The priest looks at with complete disdain: FATHER BENEDETTO
7) 213) text: Of course I do not tell him. How do I know him? He is maybe the police. Certainly he is no friend. A friend would know your pensione. Besides... FATHER BENEDETTO leans close and whispers: FATHER BENEDETTO
7) 214) text: Friends do not carry guns. FATHER BENEDETTO glances shrewdly at JACK, his eyes searc into him. FATHER BENEDETTO
7) 216) text: Shoulder holster. FATHER BENEDETTO
7) 218) text: You're a true friend, father. FATHER BENEDETTO
7) 221) dialog: Signor Clarke? Again the priest leans close, holding JACK by the elbow i gesture of austere confidence.
7) 222) dialog: I make a mistake. He did not say he was from La Svizzera: Switzerland. He said- forgive me the names in Italian are so similar- La Svezia: Sweden.
9) 1) dialog: Buon giorno! He's twenty meters away, his hand raised in half-welcome, half-benediction. They greet one another and FATHER BENEDETTO falls into sl step with JACK. The priest walks with his hands behind hi back. JACK with his hands in his pockets.
9) 2) dialog: I walk here to meditate. Once a week, Wednesday, the farthest one can travel in the week from the Sabbath. The trees are like the Stations of the Cross: by certain trees I thank God for certain favours he has granted me, or certain gifts he has made to me and all men. For example, here by this pine, I thank him for the many friendships I have and ask him to look after those of my friends who are troubled. They reach a Cypress tree and FATHER BENEDETTO bows his h in prayer. After a while he says:
9) 3) dialog: Some walk here in the cool of evening. Others come at night. There is a slight sadness in his voice as he says to hims
9) 4) dialog: I wonder how many bastards have been made here?
9) 7) text: What makes you think I'm leaving? FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 9) text: All men are sinners. FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 11) text: I don't seek peace. I never have. FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 13) text: Perhaps. Perhaps I'll stay. The valley. The villages. The mountains. FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 15) text: I see a whore. She's young enough to be my daughter. FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 17) text: Aren't all sins equal? FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 20) text: You should like to remain here and find your peace at last. Yet you cannot. There is something you cannot ignore. Some force. Some enemy. JACK is silent. FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 21) text: You want to speak but you dare not. You know no one sufficiently well to share your history with them. You know I am trustworthy yet still you are cautious. FATHER BENEDETTO stops, compelling JACK to stop too- and him. FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 23) text: Who says? FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 25) text: Everyone's on the run from something. FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 27) text: I've done nothing I didn't have good cause to do. FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 29) text: For what reason? FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 31) text: I make things. Artifacts. FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 34) text: Why do you say that? FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 36) text: You know a lot about me. FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 38) text: And I should too? FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 40) text: Fabio. The `car doctor'. Was he conceived here father? FATHER BENEDETTO is motionless. FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 42) text: He looks like you. Even more than he does in the photos you keep of each other. Where was he conceived, father? Under one of these trees? At night? Like all the other bastards? There is a very, very long pause. FATHER BENEDETTO stares at JACK with extraordinary intensity. FATHER BENEDETTO
9) 43) text: I do not remember, Signor. It was twenty-five years ago. FATHER BENEDETTO walks. JACK follows. A gust of wind make dust swirl from the gravel path. The two men do not speak again until they reach the next set of Cyprus trees.
9) 45) dialog: In the end it is I who confesses to you.
9) 47) dialog: Perhaps. For your own good. You cannot doubt the existence of Hell. You live in it. It is a place without love. As for me, I go about my daily duties because the town requires it of me. Some know what you know. Perhaps I have no right to wear these robes. But I do have a heart full of a father's love. Something close to His heart! And for that I am both grateful and happy. On JACK.
9) 48) dialog: What do you have, my friend? Another gust of wind. The priest looks up into JACK's fac The assassin's eyes are red and stinging. Perhaps its fro the dust.
10) 97) dialog: Ciao Fabio, come stai?
10) 99) dialog: Dear Father Benedetto. I promised myself that I would write to you- as your friend- to say goodbye...
10) 101) dialog: Everything I've ever done... JACK leaves. Only thing is left behind: The book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART &amp; ARCHITECTURE on th bedside table.
10) 102) dialog: I've done for a reason.
12) 101) text: What will you tell them? A beat. FATHER BENEDETTO takes something from inside his Soutane. And holds it up with a trembling hand. JACK'S LETTER. FATHER BENEDETTO
12) 102) text: I will them that the man who wrote this letter is my friend. FATHER BENEDETTO smiles sadly. FATHER BENEDETTO
12) 103) text: Jack. FATHER BENEDETTO shuts his eyes, muttering a quiet prayer The SIRENS get closer. We hear Carabinieri screeching to a halt and clambering o of their cars, cocking submachine guns. When FATHER BENEDETTO opens his eyes again... ...JACK has disappeared.
