0) 174) text: MOVE ON to another TABLE where TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN  sit, equally evident, watching BILLY. TEX sits in his car, in the distance, casually glancing a a newspaper. BILLY's eyes rove. INTERIOR PUDDING SHOPPE Large. Many tables. Stairs. A bac exit. ANOTHER GYPSY BOY leads a huge PINK PIG leashed with a  wooden sign around its neck proclaiming "Pig" in Turkish. Various TURKS point the pig out, laughing at it, some  disgusted by it, making faces and gestures: "Go way, go  way!  "Ayip!"  The PIG moves past BILLY, who shifts his  gaze to: POV - CABDRIVER #1 lingering at the curb. PAN to CABDRIVE #2  PAN to CABDRIVER #3. PAN BACK to #1 and again to #2  indicating no real fix on identity. BILLY tense now, knowing this is the chance he must take, nods with his head, pointing at CABDRIVER #2, off. THE PLAINCLOTHESMEN move out towards CABDRIVER #2. BILLY tentatively rises, as if to join them, but moves  slyly towards the interior of the cafe. PLAINCLOTHESMEN move in roughly on a surprised CABDRIVER  #2 who begins to protest LOUDLY (AD LIB). BILLY moves through the INTERIOR of the PUDDING SHOPPE,  past the tables, past the stairs, towards the back of the shop, at a normal.to attract attention.   A PLAINCLOTHESMAN looks around, sees he is gone. Tells th others (AD LIB) They spread out looking, abandoning the  CABDRIVER #2 who spits and curses them (AD LIB).   BILLY, with one backward glance, now eases out the BACK  DOOR, into a bilious sunlight, onto a STREET. Pause. A HAND with GUN moves into FRAME pointing a six-inch barr right at his temple.  BILLY freezes, moving just his eyes to: TEX looking down at him calm, merciless.
0) 175) dialog: You seem like a nice enough kid to  me Billy, but try it and I'll blow  your fucking brains out.
0) 421) text: THE THREE they play against are hilarious looking in this context, moving like big clumsy bears, waving their arms  and screaming at each other, disorganized. Ever conscious of fashion, they have their jackets and vests off but pla in their Elvis Presley shirts rolled up at the sleeves,  shiny slacks, black pointed pumps. The boys wear shorts  and sneakers. On the sidelines we see a group of PRISONER laying bets and shouting encouragement. BILLY leaps up for a ball close to the net and as the  TURKISH OPPONENT backs off, he dinks the ball in just ove the net; the Turk SCREAMS his teammates scream at him.
