He moves somewhat stuf in the clothes we saw laid out on the bed; his face  complicated by dark, rather ridiculous aviator sunglasses and an increasing edge of nervousness to his actions. Wit him is: SUSAN 23, healthy outdoor looks, dressed casually colorfu like an American student abroad. APPROACHING P.O.V. - a group of TURKISH SECURITY GUARDS,  in rumpled green uniforms, at a security CHECKPOINT inspe the carry-on bags of several PASSENGERS. BILLY tensely contemplating the guards as he walks. SUSAN digging in her bag for her passport as she walks. BILLY, looking from guards ahead to SUSAN.

But a flow of upcoming  PASSENGERS slows her descent. BILLY is led roughly by TWO SOLDIERS parallel to the plan his hands on his head. He manages a glance at Susan. A  slight but strong movement of the head and eyes. 'No. Don come down the stairs' SUSAN understands it, looks helplessly, hesitates lost  between two worlds. A silent shaping of a puzzled mouth.
0) 79) dialog: ...Billy...?
0) 948) text: BILLY plods without interest to the specified cabin, clos the door, sits in the chair. No one is there. He waits - indifferent to any sense of time. Dirty two glass panes  separate visitor and prisoner booths; bars are between th panes.  An erratic microphone is the method of  communication, giving a weird and distant aspect to the  voice. HAMIDOU opens a small peep-hole in the cabin door, looks  in unseen as: TEE VISITOR DOOR opens and SUSAN tentatively walks in  holding a large photo album; it takes several moments for her to react, and then her face shows the shock. BILLY stares at her, his face rabid, decaying; if he  remembers her even, he doesn't register it because she is a shock to him as well. Reality, the outside world all at once. His mind is spinning, unbalanced, unable to grasp  it.

SUSAN fingers the photo album nervously, speaking slow an distinct; not sure she is communicating.

0) 957) dialog: Billy - you'll just make yourself  crazy.
0) 960) text: A strange look in his eye. SUSAN slowly, scared, begins to unbutton her shirt. HAMIDOU looks on silently, does nothing. BILLY follows every movement with wild-eyed lust. SUSAN leans up close to the window.  With both hands on  the front of her blouse, she slowly draws it apart. BILLY going wild! Against the window. His hand down in hi pyjamas. HER BREASTS spring free, quivering, full and ripe with a  deep cleavage and hard dark nipples. They hang full and  loose.  FULL SCREEN BILLY'S EYES - FULL SCREEN. BILLY beats on the window, working his mouth soundlessly. SUSAN is shattered, scared of Billy's sanity.

0) 986) text: Pause. Silence. She closes her eyes, in pain; she doesn't think she has reached him. She turns to go, resigned. BILLY looking at her. Behind him HAMIDOU opens the door. A calm and cunning look on his face, glancing with Billy  towards A BRIEF GLIMPSE of SUSAN looking back, the album under he arm. The door closes.
0) 1002) text: He takes them, puts a few into his mouth, swallows.   Reflective, unsure.  A RADIO playing OFF blares suddenly  with the U.S. Armed Forces Station - JANIS JOPLIN singing "Take another piece of my heat now, Baby" then it's switc back to a TURKISH STATION, loud. Billy rises. BILLY enters the TOILET with the PHOTO ALBUM tightly  clutched under his arm. A dark stone room, very shadowy.  Piles of waste on the floor. A vacant-eyed barefoot LUNAT shuffles past BILLY who goes to one of the four partition HOLES cut into the floor. ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY squats over it and with his filthy  long nails he starts to slit open the back binder of the  album Susan gave him. Flickering shadows. He looks up  absently. THREE LUNATIC FACES stare in at him through wooden slats, tongues hanging out and drooling - playing with themselve OFF. BILLY makes a lunatic face and SCREAM kicking at the  partition.
0) 1141) text: Framing Billy are SUSAN and his FATHER, both silent.  The look with him at HIS SISTER, BROTHER, UNCLE, AUNT, SISTER-In-LAW FAMILY  FRIEND - AND GRANDMOTHER, all on the porch of the ordinar house in BABYLON, LONG ISLAND - DAY; all of them returnin his gaze in that first SILENT moment. Curiosity.  Recognition. Shock. Love. And then they move. But we don't hear their movements. It is SOUNDLESS reunion; the SISTER running out first in SLO MOTION, the MOTHER following last, crying; the GRANDMOTHE too infirm to move, the shaking her head from side to sid in SLOW MOTION, her tears lost somewhere in the wrinkles  of her face.  BILLY surrounded by FAMILY - SLOW MOTION - SOUNDLESS.  Hi eyes flooding. All the feelings in him.  And deep inside a solitary question.
