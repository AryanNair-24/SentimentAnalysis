Dirty two glass panes  separate visitor and prisoner booths; bars are between th panes.  An erratic microphone is the method of  communication, giving a weird and distant aspect to the  voice. HAMIDOU opens a small peep-hole in the cabin door, looks  in unseen as: TEE VISITOR DOOR opens and SUSAN tentatively walks in  holding a large photo album; it takes several moments for her to react, and then her face shows the shock. BILLY stares at her, his face rabid, decaying; if he  remembers her even, he doesn't register it because she is a shock to him as well. Reality, the outside world all at once.

HER BREASTS spring free, quivering, full and ripe with a  deep cleavage and hard dark nipples. They hang full and  loose.  FULL SCREEN BILLY'S EYES - FULL SCREEN. BILLY beats on the window, working his mouth soundlessly. SUSAN is shattered, scared of Billy's sanity.

BILLY enters the TOILET with the PHOTO ALBUM tightly  clutched under his arm. A dark stone room, very shadowy.  Piles of waste on the floor. A vacant-eyed barefoot LUNAT shuffles past BILLY who goes to one of the four partition HOLES cut into the floor. ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY squats over it and with his filthy  long nails he starts to slit open the back binder of the  album Susan gave him. Flickering shadows. He looks up  absently.

BILLY looking, bent over by the ear - a hint of awareness of new surroundings. ANOTHER ANGLE - the BATH is deserted, spooky with greenis Yellow fish light flittering down from holes in ceiling  around damp mossy arches. Steam rises off a bath.  Benche buckets of water.

HAMIDOU - sweat pouring off his face, excited.

This man is dredging Billy  through a sadistic imagination sparked by the steam, the  sweat, and an ethnic identification with a Turkish steam  bath as a bedroom.
