The car passes within a few feet of them drives on. A moment later, a chrome and leather monster of a Harley  Davidson pulls into the lot. The rider is dressed in an a comical array of leather, silver and suede. He waves to the Caddy as it parks a few yards from Keaton and the others. It sits quietly, almost menacing. As he gets closer, we can see he is wearing one black boo and one red. Keaton is still looking at them when the bik pulls up to them and stops. REDFOOT and McManus shake hands.
