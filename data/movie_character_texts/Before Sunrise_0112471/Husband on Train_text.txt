CELINE, a young woman in her mid-twenties, is curled up i her seat reading Georges Bataill’s Story of the Eye. Strikingly attractive, she plays it down by wearing no makeup, a loose-fitting vintage dress, and flat shoes. Sh continues reading while taking an occasional bite of a chocolate bar. Sitting four rows back and on the other si of the aisle, JESSE, also mid-twenties, is engrossed in K Kinski’s memoir, All I Need Is Love. Casually good lookin but a little scruffy, he dresses in the jeans and T-shirt mode. Suddenly a couple, two fortyish types who have been arguing semiquietly in the seat behind Celine, start yell at each other in German. The WIFE takes a swipe at the newspaper the HUSBAND has been screening him behind.
0) 2) dialog: What’ve I been doing the last thirty minutes? Would you shut up for Chrissake?
0) 4) dialog: I said shut up! I’m putting down my newspaper and telling you to shut up. Celine suddenly gets up, grabs her bag, and starts lookin for another seat. A few rows back, she finds a seat acros the aisle from Jesse. Before sitting down, they make brie eye contact and kind of shake their heads and smile at th tension. Just as she settles in and goes back to her book the wife gets up and storms down the aisle. Jesse and Cel follow her with their eyes, and as she passes them, they they are looking right at each other. He makes a funny “u oh” face.
