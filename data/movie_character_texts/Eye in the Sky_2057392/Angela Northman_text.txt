94) 8) dialog: I don’t care about your “list” General. I came here to witness a capture, not a targeted assassination! BENSON eyes her coldly. WOODALE looks to GEORGE, the Atto General, for advice, putting him on the spot.
116) 12) dialog: Hold on a minute, this is a change of mission from a capture to a ‘shoot to kill’ - isn’t it?
116) 14) dialog: Are we all right with that? A beat.
116) 15) dialog: I am sure we are not. There are two British nationals - and an American - as targets.
118) 2) dialog: What of the Kenyan government?
118) 4) dialog: For a drone strike?
118) 8) dialog: No! Such a “plan” should not have been signed off by the PM without the authority of Parliament.

197) 5) dialog: Colonel, perhaps you should address that comment to the little girl selling her bread! The ethical argument is precisely what we must “get into.”
205) 3) dialog: With respect, you can only assume those deaths - but what is certain is that, if we do act now, this one girl will suffer.
205) 5) dialog: Yes. I would save her and take that risk. That is what I would do.
205) 8) dialog: (quietly, respectfully) You, James... But frankly... politically... I’d rather point to Al-Shabaab as murderers of eighty people shopping than have to defend a drone attack by our forces that kills an innocent child. A beat. Everyone is wrestling with the dilemma. GEORGE sh awkwardly, perhaps persuaded by Angela’s new argument.
222) 4) dialog: (under her breath) Bloody coward...
305) 0) text: The meeting is over. GEORGE and BRIAN leave quietly, brie awkwardly, shaking Benson’s hand. As the room empties, ANGELA looks across the table as BEN begins packing his things. 349 350 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 133.
