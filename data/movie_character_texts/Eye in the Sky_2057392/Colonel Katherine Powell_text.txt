2) 7) dialog: Try the tap.
2) 9) dialog: Are you with Robert or Andrew?
2) 12) dialog: Who is she? YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 9.
2) 14) dialog: I know her name. ROBERT casually goes to the fridge and opens the door.
2) 16) dialog: Does she. You should have asked me if she could stay.
2) 18) dialog: She’s already got water.
6) 1) dialog: Simon, I will not have the boys bringing friends back for the night without asking me. (a beat) I’m not having it. (a beat) If they want to do all that, they can do it away from home. She's still so angry about it, she can’t finish the call:
6) 2) dialog: It’s not right - and I’m not having it. That hasn’t calmed her down either. INT. LIVING ROOM / KITCHEN - STEVE’S HOUSE - NIGHT 21 (NOTE: This scene was formerly scene 13.) STEVE, showered and wrapped in a towel, enters an open-pl living room / kitchen area from a hallway. He crosses to a kitchen counter where A HOME COOKED MEAL simple plate has been covered and set aside for him. STEVE uncovers the food, looks at it for a moment, then places it into a micro-wave and presses a RE-HEAT button.
8) 2) dialog: Thank you. She looks at it.
8) 3) dialog: Only two Hellfires? Where are the GBU-12's?
8) 5) dialog: So, I have just the two Hellfires? 25 26 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 13.
8) 7) dialog: Sergeant, next time, you clear it with me before you change the loadout, understand?
11) 2) dialog: Is the Reaper following? A WARRANT OFFICER at another desk responds:
11) 4) dialog: Headed for Parklands? A YOUNG FEMALE CORPORAL at another station watches a scre that tracks the route of the SUV on a map of Nairobi.
15) 1) dialog: (into a headset) Hawaii5, North20, looks like we have Sea Hawk, but I’d like a positive ID.
15) 3) dialog: Showman50, North20. Good morning Moses - how are you this morning? 35 36 37 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 17.
16) 2) dialog: Confirm Sea Hawk is in the blue zone but Condor is still in flight?

18) 1) dialog: General. Good morning. 39 40 4l 42 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 19.

34) 1) dialog: Showman50, North20, can we get a view into the house?
47) 2) dialog: Loud and clear, Colonel, thank you. It’s good to see you again.
47) 7) dialog: Thank you. Today you will be flying a joint operation over Nairobi, Kenya. Code name: Operation Egret. As POWELL proceeds with the brief she clicks on relevant images that appear on a second screen in the room.
47) 8) dialog: (showing a map) Horn of Africa. Somalia. Kenya. Nairobi. (MORE )
47) 10) dialog: We have intelligence of a meeting of key members of Al-Shabaab in the suburb of Parklands - in this house here. Over a Reaper image of a house in the suburb of Parklands
47) 11) dialog: It belongs to a man named Shahid Ahmed, an Al-Shabaab facilitator. She puts up the image of Ahmed with Al-Shabaab leaders:
47) 12) dialog: Due to visit the house is this man, Abdullah Al-Hady, a Somali... She puts up an image of Al-Hady.
47) 13) dialog: .-. and his wife Ayesha Al-Hady, formerly Susan Helen Danford. She flips through images of Danford, some as a troubled t in the UK, the rest, intelligence pics of her as a jihadi
47) 14) dialog: British national. Troubled childhood. Converted at fifteen. Radicalized in a west London mosque where she met and married Al-Hady. Intelligence has them connected to the most recent suicide bombing in Kenya. We see SHOCKING IMAGES of the carnage caused by a SUICIDE BOMBING in Kenya.
47) 15) dialog: We've been tracking them for six years. Last seen in Addis Ababa two months ago. We see images of DANFORD and AL-HADY in Addis Ababa.
47) 16) dialog: They're numbers four and five on our East Africa Most Wanted List. We have information that they will be in Nairobi today, using the Parklands house as a transit point for two new recruits: 70 71 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 33. POWELL puts up an image of an American dressed boy: MUHAM ABDISALAAM, taken in a mall somewhere in the USA.
47) 17) dialog: Muhammad Abdisalaam, American - the CIA have him connected to extremists in Minnesota. She puts up another image: RASHEED HAMUD at a protest in London with a charismatic ISLAMIC SPEAKER.
47) 18) dialog: And Rasheed Hamud, British. She puts up the image of the house again.
47) 19) dialog: Once all suspects are in the house, Kenyan special forces will launch a cordon and search. This is an operation to capture, not kill. You are tasked to be their eye in the sky.
53) 1) dialog: (into headset) Hawaii5, North20, confirm PID.
54) 2) dialog: Peg90, go closer for PID.
56) 2) dialog: Roger that. She hasn’t taken her eyes off her suspects. Then she sees A DRIVER open the rear doors of the SUV.
56) 3) dialog: Damn it, they’re leaving. Where are Danford and Al-Hady?
56) 5) dialog: (mot happy) Well then our intelligence is bad!
59) 1) dialog: No, hold your men. I want Danford and I’m hoping they will lead us to her. She's taking a calculated risk here and she feels it. 82 83 84 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 38.
63) 1) dialog: Who is that? Is that Danford?! I need a PID!
66) 1) dialog: Damn it, is that her, or does Ahmed have a wife?!
66) 3) dialog: Not good enough people! It has to be her. Why didn’t we know she was already in the house?! There’s an embarrassed silence. The image from the bird s the SUV move as the gates to the compound are opened.
68) 1) dialog: Hawaii5, I want a PID on that woman as soon as we get a visual.
70) 2) dialog: That’s a no go area.
70) 4) dialog: How do we launch a ground assault if she’s going in there?
70) 6) dialog: (to herself) Shit... (to Owiti) Alright, just stay with her. She watches the SUV slow down, turn into a side road and stop at AN AL-SHABAAB MILITIA CHECKPOINT.
73) 1) dialog: Showman50, do we know this house?
75) 1) dialog: Hawaii5, North20, did you see anything there?
77) 1) dialog: Showman50, we need an eye inside that house.
78) 2) dialog: I have to know if Danford is inside and who is with her.
78) 4) dialog: Even if you use a Somali?
78) 6) dialog: Major, we both believe we have Danford in that house, do we not?
78) 8) dialog: And I cannot authorize a strike without a Positive ID...
78) 10) dialog: Then I believe we need to accept the risk and send someone in. Can you do it?
78) 12) dialog: Thank you. I appreciate what you are doing. 107 108 109 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 45.
83) 2) dialog: Showman50, how long before you have your man in the area?
84) 2) dialog: Good. Do that. Thank you. POWELL is also, for a few moments, distracted by ALIA. EXT. ALIA’S COMPOUND - AFTERNOON A120 FATIMA looks out from inside her house.
89) 1) dialog: Follow him. POWELL watches the image as the beetle enters the kitchen rises quickly into the wooden rafters. The house has no ceilings, and from up in the darkened rafters the beetle follows AMADU out of the kitchen and i INT. LIVING ROOM - AMADU’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 129 The beetle in the rafters watches AMADU as he enters the living room with the tray of dates and glasses of zam zam There is a carpet and a small raised dias in the centre o the room. On the wall is a large framed sura (verse) from the Quran in ornate calligraphy. RASHEED and MUHAMMAD are sitting crossed legged on velvet cushions. There is no other furniture. Both look anxious. AMADU sets the tray on the dias before RASHEED and MUHAMM with great reverence. The woman, who may be Danford, is sitting opposite them w her back to the camera. AMADU sits on a cushion himself. The woman gestures to the dates and water, prompting the young recruits to help themselves. The young men reach for the dates, taking one each and ea with small bites.
90) 1) dialog: Get Ringo around the other side to identify the woman. 131 132 133 134 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 55. The beetle moves position. The live feed shows the unidentified woman looking up, ha seen or heard something. Her look is almost directly into camera. A terrifying moment for POWELL...
92) 1) dialog: That's Danford. Hawaii5, confirm PID please! INT. ROOM —- HICKAM AIR FORCE BASE - NIGHT 133 LUCY matches library images of Danford with a frame grab the beetle. She works quickly to identify her.
93) 1) dialog: Hawaii5, thank you! She types a secure text at her desktop to BENSON: POWELL: We have her!
98) 1) dialog: That’s him. That’s her husband. Hawaii5, confirm. YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 59.
100) 2) dialog: Excellent. (into her mike) Showman50, we have them both. Al41 INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - COMPANY D BASE - AFTERNOON A1 OWITI stares at the beetle’s image of AL-HADY on his lap
100) 4) dialog: I need Peg90 to take me into the other rooms. Let’s see who else might be coming for tea.
104) 1) dialog: Shit... She raises a hand to her mouth.
108) 1) dialog: I want legal in here now!
108) 4) dialog: Sick bastard.
108) 6) dialog: Looks like Osman Abade. He supplied the explosives in the Lamu bombing. We tried to capture him in Mombasa last August and lost two men in the process.
111) 1) dialog: We need to put a Hellfire through that roof - right now. We cut between the two:
111) 3) dialog: I no longer have a capture option. Any action on the ground will lead to an armed confrontation we will not be able to contain.
111) 5) dialog: Tell them we have Danford in our sights. That alone should be enough to justify using the hellfire. The vests are a bonus.
111) 7) dialog: They cannot have her alive. Six years I’ve tracked her, Frank. We need to expand our rules of engagement right now if we want to protect the civilian population. A hellfire through that roof is our most effective option. A beat. BENSON paces. 152 153 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 64.
111) 9) dialog: Of course. I’m getting into that now.
113) 2) dialog: Major, you've been following?
113) 4) dialog: The plan is to put a Hellfire through the roof of this house. I need legal clearance and I need it now.
113) 6) dialog: Yes.
113) 8) dialog: No. We have two suicide vests with explosives inside that house. Can you clear me a higher CDE? HAROLD looks anxious and needs a moment to think. YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 65.
113) 9) dialog: This is a time sensitive target. Do I have authority to strike?
113) 11) dialog: Yes, and my weapons only invoke a low CDE. It’s the explosives inside the house that bring it to a potentially high CDE.
113) 13) dialog: Jesus, we have two suicide bombers and three very High Value Individuals inside that house!
113) 15) dialog: Are you telling me that, or just debating with me?
115) 1) dialog: Sir, legal has advised me to refer up to the Attorney General. I need a quick answer. She watches the image from the beetle as the young RASHEE and MUHAMMAD rise to greet ABADE with great respect.
117) 1) dialog: (to Mushtaq) Generate new damage rings for this compound with an assessment of the payload in those jackets.
117) 3) dialog: Let’s have it now. YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 68.
120) 1) dialog: Colonel, may I speak to your pilot directly? Walsh hesitates for just a moment.
121) 3) dialog: Lieutenant, you are now our best option to take these HVI’s out. Prepare to launch a single AGM-114 Hellfire on the target house.
121) 5) dialog: This is a friendly city. Collateral damage must be kept to a minimum.
123) 2) dialog: Yes?
124) 1) dialog: Yes, it is Lieutenant. 164 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 71.
124) 3) dialog: Lieutenant, we have new rules of engagement. You are covered.
124) 5) dialog: Expect strike details shortly. This is going to happen fast so be ready to shoot.
128) 1) dialog: Christ Almighty... She turns to MUSHTAQ, at work on his computer.
128) 2) dialog: Do we have that CDE?
128) 4) dialog: But we would be containing that payload in the vests within those walls, right? Far less collateral damage than them going off ina crowded shopping mall.
128) 6) dialog: Thank you. Obvious to anyone not trying to avoid making a decision. MUSHTAQ watches POWELL walk back to her station - not entirely comfortable with her fixation on using the missi
130) 1) dialog: Showman50, North20, when we attack, you will need to extract your man on the ground in a hurry. Prepare him to leave the area.
134) 1) dialog: (into her mike) Standby.
140) 1) dialog: Lieutenant, we are clarifying our strike approval. Sit tight and be ready to shoot.
151) 1) dialog: (to herself) Thank you... She reaches for her secure phone to STEVE as she watches RASHEED standing to begin having his suicide vest fitted. 192 193 194 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 83.
151) 2) dialog: Lieutenant, you have clearance to prosecute the target.
156) 3) dialog: Bit late for that.
161) 1) dialog: You are cleared to engage, Lieutenant. INT. ROOM —- HICKAM AIR FORCE BASE - NIGHT 204 LUCY watches ALIA on the live feed.
162) 1) dialog: I repeat: you are cleared to engage. STEVE is desperately tense. CARRIE, frightened, looks at
167) 1) dialog: We have this one opportunity, let’s not lose it.
167) 4) dialog: These men are about to disperse. Engage now. A beat. STEVE is desperate to delay - but he also doesn’t want to let down the team and the mission.
167) 8) dialog: Lieutenant, you have clearance. There is a lot more at stake than you see here in this image.
167) 10) dialog: The situation has not changed Lieutenant. You are cleared to engage. CARRIE, keen not to disobey orders, anxiously looks at ST
167) 12) dialog: I repeat, you are cleared to engage! STEVE is terrified by the presence of ALIA.
167) 14) dialog: Re-run CDE.
167) 16) dialog: Weapons hold. Despite her irritation, POWELL shows a moment of relief. STEVE eases his finger off the trigger.
170) 1) dialog: Sergeant, re-run CDE!
170) 3) dialog: Showman50, North20, get your man with the beetle to buy this girl’s bread and get her out of there. 213
172) 2) dialog: Tell him we’re on weapons hold.
174) 2) dialog: Thank you, Major. POWELL watches the Reaper screen as JAMA approaches ALIA.
181) 1) dialog: Get me back to the house.
187) 2) dialog: Forget the bread, Sergeant. We will be lucky if our man hasn't blown the whole operation. (to Harold) Harold, where are we legally?
187) 4) dialog: Yes! Are we clear?
187) 6) dialog: No, I am asking you! We cannot hold up this operation any longer.
187) 8) dialog: We're not! It’s over. Dozens of civilian lives are at risk. Children's lives are at risk. (MORE )
187) 10) dialog: This girl is just one. Are we clear to engage? Yes or no! Make a decision!
187) 12) dialog: Don’t lecture me, Harold!
187) 14) dialog: Bloody hell... On her Reaper Screen: Alia sells her bread. Unknown to he ABDI appears in the yard and begins an animated discussio with a GUARD. After a while, the GUARD enters the house. On the Beetle feed she sees RASHEED arms clasped across h chest, while ABADE moves MUHAMMAD into a kneeling positio front of the video camera.
188) 4) dialog: Sir, our lawyer says the girl’s presence has not necessarily altered the legitimacy of our operation, but he needs that confirmed. POWELL is still keeping an eye on all her screens.
188) 6) dialog: The targeteer assesses a 65 to 75 percent chance of fatal injury should we proceed. But he has also assessed a projected loss of life of between thirty and eighty men, women and children if the vests are detonated in an urban area. It’s a guess of course. But we should assume they intend to target a crowded location. No one knows quite what to say. On the Beetle screen, ABA recording of Muhammad's suicide video continues.
197) 0) text: ALIA’S presence is haunting this room too, disturbing everyone, whatever their point of view. WOODALE continues to sweat through his indecision. COLONEL POWELL is on a screen.
197) 1) dialog: Sir, if we wait and they leave, we will no longer have control of the situation. Nairobi is a busy, crowded city. We must strike now. The room is silent for a moment. BENSON fills the silence
197) 4) dialog: Secretary, this is an ethical argument we cannot get into at this moment.
205) 2) dialog: Sir, if we do not act now we risk losing the lives of up to eighty people. Many will be children.
212) 1) dialog: For God's sake. Her phone rings.
212) 3) dialog: You are on stand by, Lieutenant.
216) 2) dialog: What’s happened to the feed?!
217) 2) dialog: What?
218) 1) dialog: Christ... She has lost control of the situation. 110. 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 111. She stares hopelessly at the dead screen. And then at the Reaper image of the exterior of the house: Nothing is happening outside. Her phone rings.
219) 2) dialog: Battery...
219) 4) dialog: I might have a solution. If my targeteer can calculate us coming in under fifty per cent for the collateral damage on the girl then do you think we will get approval at your end? A beat. BENSON can only speak with others listening.
220) 1) dialog: We are looking to present the collateral damage in the street, in this area here, as forty-five to fifty per cent fatality. MUSHTAQ tenses up. YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 112.
220) 2) dialog: Is that possible?
220) 4) dialog: If we can put the payload here or here, if we can still guarantee target fatality but reduce the collateral... A tense pause.
220) 5) dialog: Perhaps we can target the missile here... or here...
220) 7) dialog: Do whatever you can to save this girl's life.
223) 2) dialog: Sixty-five?
223) 4) dialog: I need that calculation to be below fifty per cent. YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 114. A long pause.
223) 6) dialog: Perhaps there is an adjustment in the assessment on the impact here?
223) 8) dialog: Or if you target the missile here?
223) 10) dialog: I need you to make this work, Sergeant. A beat. MUSHTAQ looks cornered.
223) 11) dialog: Do you understand?
223) 13) dialog: We are locked into this kill chain and a decision has to be made. There are many lives at stake.
223) 15) dialog: Forty-five per cent?
223) 17) dialog: I will put that to Cobra.
223) 19) dialog: It is my understanding that, in these circumstances, your calculation can only be speculation. That puts you beyond any culpability.
223) 21) dialog: Thank you, Sergeant. POWELL goes back to her desk. Looks at ALIA on the screen She knows that she will be her executioner.
224) 1) dialog: Sir, I have a revised assessment from the targeteer. A diagram appears on one of the other screens.
224) 2) dialog: If you look at the diagram... By targeting the missile here, there is an estimated forty-five per cent chance of collateral fatality in this area here, where the girl is positioned. Suddenly everyone can see the get-out.
224) 3) dialog: We have now done everything in our power to give this girl a chance to survive.
226) 2) dialog: Thank you, sir. She puts the phone down.
228) 1) dialog: Lieutenant, we have re-run the CDE. You are authorised to prosecute the target. Engage now. Am I clear?
234) 2) dialog: We've been up and down the chain enough, Moses. We’re not taking any more delays.
245) 1) dialog: When they pass the house, we go.
248) 1) dialog: He’s buying the bread... She looks at her stopwatch.
248) 2) dialog: Forty seconds.
257) 1) dialog: Nine seconds.
264) 1) dialog: Sky45, North20. Zoom in for BDA when able. We need to know that we have hit our targets. 309 310 311 312 313 314 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 125.
267) 1) dialog: Is that a body?
267) 3) dialog: Sky45, close in.
273) 1) dialog: Re-engage target. HAROLD flashes her a look...
273) 3) dialog: (ignoring him) We're going again.
274) 1) dialog: Target the moving body. STEVE and CARRIE take a deep breath. They have fallen int their own hell.
296) 1) dialog: Lieutenant, are you okay? We cut between them: STEVE answers on the phone. He is not okay. And neither is CARRIE.
296) 3) dialog: You have done your job well.
296) 5) dialog: We have eliminated three high value targets. A beat. STEVE is silent.
296) 6) dialog: And we have saved a lot of lives.
296) 8) dialog: I’m sorry, Sergeant, I couldn’t see any other option.
296) 10) dialog: You will file your report as a 45 percent CDE. Silence from MUSHTAQ.
296) 11) dialog: Sergeant? A beat.
302) 1) dialog: (quietly, sombre) Mission accomplished.
303) 2) dialog: Thank you, Frank.
