42) 6) dialog: Morning, Frank. ON SCREEN - “GEORGE MATHERSON MP - UK Attorney General."
94) 10) dialog: Frank, I’m sorry, but I agree with Angela. The idea was to capture Danford, not kill her. That is the mission approved by the P.M. And as Attorney General, that is what I came here to witness. We want her brought back to this country to stand trial. A beat.
116) 2) dialog: Well given the new circumstances... I would say yes. Brian? WOODALE hesitates. As the senior politician, it’s his cal
116) 3) dialog: There is a political as well as a legal call to be made here.
116) 7) dialog: No. We don’t. YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 67. Angela looks far less sure.
116) 13) dialog: Yes... It is.
118) 1) dialog: Angela, we have a Memorandum of Understanding between our two governments that covers us in a situation where a citizen chooses to align themselves with a terrorist organization.
122) 1) dialog: Angela, in my view all the legal criteria for an attack have been met, namely: This is a military necessity, there is no reasonable alternative, and the force to be used is in proportion to the threat. That should answer your question.
127) 1) dialog: Angela, I agree we are at risk of being perceived by the press as embarking on a ‘shoot to kill’ policy. But since all the legal criteria are sound - I believe we must allow this military action to continue.
127) 6) dialog: And the rules of engagement mean that the Prime Minister has already approved it - and therefore the Foreign Secretary's input should not be relevant...
188) 5) dialog: Do we have an assessment of what might happen to her?
195) 1) dialog: A sixty-five to seventy-five per cent fatality assessment - it could be argued - requires us to do whatever we can to enable her to be removed from the scene.
195) 3) dialog: There is no law covering a situation quite like this. (MORE )
195) 6) dialog: It is one thing to release a missile doing everything in one’s power to minimise collateral damage: In other words to release a missile whilst the street is clear, but in the hope that it will remain so... It is quite another thing to release a missile knowing that this girl will, at worst, be fatally injured and, at best, severely injured. So, I disagree with the assessment of your lawyer at Northwood.
195) 8) dialog: I would be uneasy if we did not at least consider the option of delaying and giving her every chance to walk away.
197) 10) dialog: She's the senior legal adviser on the US National Security Council.
197) 16) dialog: Ms. Goldman, we have a somewhat different approach to the question of collateral damage...
201) 7) dialog: Yes there is, but, conversely, it does not mean that there is not also a legal argument for releasing the weapon now.
201) 9) dialog: (awkward) James, given the developing situation... there is a very persuasive argument that the decision to act now could be construed as legitimate.
201) 14) dialog: Exactly.
205) 9) dialog: James, Angela makes a compelling point. If Al-Shabaab kill eighty people, we win the propaganda war. If we kill one girl, they do.
222) 2) dialog: We do not have to announce that we knew anything, General. Let’s wait to hear from the PM. BENSON is shocked at George cutting him short. JACK comes in. YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 113.
305) 0) text: The meeting is over. GEORGE and BRIAN leave quietly, brie awkwardly, shaking Benson’s hand. As the room empties, ANGELA looks across the table as BEN begins packing his things. 349 350 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 133.
