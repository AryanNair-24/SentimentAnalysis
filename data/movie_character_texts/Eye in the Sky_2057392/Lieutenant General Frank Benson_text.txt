19) 1) dialog: You got my email...
20) 2) dialog: Leave it with me. Do you have everything in place for today?
20) 4) dialog: Good. I’1l be at COBRA in an hour.
30) 1) dialog: Darling it’s your dad here. I’m looking at a whole shelf of these Annabell dolls. You didn’t tell me there are different types. I’ve no idea what to buy her. Can you get back to me asap? Otherwise... He picks up one of the dolls. Squints at the packaging. 52 53 54 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 25. LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON (CONT’D) I'm holding a... um... An Annabell Time To Sleep Doll and it says here ‘you will hear her babbling when it is beddy-byes'. Call me as soon as you can. He puts away his phone. Stressed, he stares at the doll.
41) 1) dialog: General Benson. Here for COBRA. A young civil servant in a suit, JACK CLEARY, 30's approa from across the lobby, offering an outstretched hand.
42) 1) dialog: Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. He takes the doll from its bag. 64 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 28. LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON (CONT’D) Annabell Care for Me? What have I got? He sees that he has the Time To Sleep doll. LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON (CONT’D) Does it matter? I mean... We watch him as he listens: it plainly does matter. His AIDE-DE-CAMP appears by his side.
42) 3) dialog: (sighing) All right, darling, I’ll try. Yes. Bye-bye. He shuts down his phone and looks at his AIDE-DE-CAMP anxiously. LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON (CONT’D) I bought a Time To Sleep doll when I should have bought a Care For Me. Apparently there is an important difference. He hands his AIDE-DE-CAMP the doll in her bag.
42) 5) dialog: Good morning, Attorney General.
42) 7) dialog: Minister.
42) 9) dialog: Ma’am. Congratulations on your new appointment.
42) 11) dialog: I am going to talk you through the capture of Susan Danford aka Ayesha Al-Hady...
94) 1) dialog: We have Danford. WOODALE feels the tension. As the senior politician in th room responsible for Africa, he will now be on the spot t approve a new course of action - or to refer a decision t higher authority.
94) 3) dialog: No...
94) 5) dialog: Well, using the Reaper, we have the ability to strike a target with considerable accuracy... There’s shock on the faces in the room. LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON (CONT’D) If you agree, Minister... we could eliminate her. Before WOODALE can answer:
94) 7) dialog: Ma’am, she is a member of Al- Shabaab and number four on our East African most wanted list...
94) 11) dialog: Right... I will put that to Colonel Powell. He types into his secure text message service on his lapt
110) 1) dialog: What’s the plan, Katherine?
111) 2) dialog: I told you, they came to witness a capture, not a kill. Give me a capture option.
111) 4) dialog: They're watching. Even with the vests, we will need their approval for a strike.
111) 6) dialog: Danford is a British citizen. They want her alive.
111) 8) dialog: We have to know that we are legally in the clear. POWELL hides her frustration.
114) 1) dialog: Benson.
116) 1) dialog: (on phone) Okay, I will put that to him. (he turns to George) George, those explosives mean there is an imminent threat of serious harm to the civilian population. Can we strike? George draws a breath.
116) 5) dialog: (to Woodale) We need a decision now, Minister.
116) 9) dialog: Do we have permission to proceed?
116) 11) dialog: Thank you.
118) 3) dialog: This mission has the full support of both Kenya and the United States...
118) 5) dialog: Yes! A missile fired from an RPA is part of an agreed contingency plan in circumstances like this.
118) 7) dialog: Do I have permission to proceed?
118) 9) dialog: Operational issues are not generally discussed at Cabinet and certainly not in Parliament.
122) 4) dialog: (reluctantly) I do not believe so. No.
127) 3) dialog: Do I have permission, Minister? They again all turn to WOODALE. He sweats:
127) 5) dialog: (annoyed) With respect, Minister, you have heard the arguments and he hasn't.
127) 8) dialog: What am I telling Colonel Powell?
136) 3) dialog: Minister, the consequences of delay may be fatal to scores of civilians. These men could leave that house at any moment.
136) 5) dialog: If these men leave now, in separate vehicles - there are two vehicles outside - we have the ability to follow only one. We have only one eye in the sky.
136) 7) dialog: Intercept a suicide bomber on a city street?! We are trying to minimise collateral damage...
145) 1) dialog: We need a decision Minister. Right now. WOODALE is about to speak but Jack bursts back into the r 186 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 80.
146) 4) dialog: Foreign Secretary, General Benson here. With respect, this has already been cleared at American Presidential level. We have a situation that could result in massive loss of life in the next ten minutes.
150) 3) dialog: Thank you, Minister. ANGELA has run out of arguments for objecting: ON SCREEN, can see that ABADE has almost done wiring MUHAMMAD'S vest BENSON types a secure text to POWELL: “You have clearance
188) 2) dialog: (to George) Mission Command has a question on the legality of continuing the operation whilst this girl remains at the scene... Connect us, Jack. JACK activates a screen and POWELL appears on it. 230 231 232 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 98.
188) 3) dialog: Go ahead, Colonel.
195) 2) dialog: We have done what we can for her in the time available to us.
197) 2) dialog: It is generally understood that it is sometimes necessary to sacrifice the one in order to save the many.
201) 11) dialog: Foreign Secretary, there is a military necessity for acting now. In our view they will be making a move from the house at any moment.
205) 12) dialog: I suggest you keep your eye on the other screen. The beetle sees that RASHEED’S vest is slowly and careful being wired with explosives by ABADE. LIEUTENANT-GENERAL BENSON (CONT’D) With respect, Foreign Secretary, are the lives of eighty people, including innocent children, really worth the price of winning the propaganda war? 248 249 250 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 107. JAMES, caught in a terrible dilemma, stares at the screen watching as ABADE and AL-HADY wire RASHEED. The painstaki process will take time, but it is chilling to watch.
208) 1) dialog: Sir, the footage from the Reaper is completely secure.
208) 3) dialog: Foreign Secretary, I assure you...
208) 7) dialog: Foreign Secretary, it is our task to make the right military decision. We cannot engage in an argument about possible future postings on You Tube.
219) 1) dialog: What happened?!
219) 3) dialog: For God’s sake, now we have no idea when they might leave the house. POWELL talks discreetly, away from the room.
219) 5) dialog: Yes. I do. Thank you.
222) 1) dialog: If we have to announce to the people of Nairobi that we knew everything but we did nothing...
222) 8) dialog: Minister, we cannot have military decisions dictated by government committees! Nor can we put on hold a military operation at every stage for legal clarification. You tell us when to go to war, we conduct the war and you deal with the aftermath.
224) 4) dialog: Thank you Colonel. (to Woodale) Minister, do we have authority to prosecute the target? 268 269 270 YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT 12 September 2014 116. Everyone now looks to him.
224) 6) dialog: Yes. Minister, you recommended earlier that we do not delay in proceeding with this mission. With a lower CDE there is surely now no need to consult the PM. Or the Foreign Secretary. May we proceed? WOODALE is skewered.
226) 1) dialog: You may proceed.
303) 1) dialog: Good job. Well done, Katherine.
305) 2) dialog: I have attended the immediate aftermath of five suicide bombings. On the ground. With the bodies. What you witnessed today, with your coffee and biscuits, is terrible. What these men would have done would have been even more terrible. That is how it is. (almost killing her with the line) Never tell a soldier that he does not know the cost of war. He takes his briefcase and walks out.
306) 1) dialog: Thank you, Captain. He takes the doll and walks away down the quiet hallway.
