2) 0) text: SNOW/MOONLIGHT/THE SHADOWY BUILDINGS and the silence of t Nebraska winter except for the sound of the snowshoes. The snow has obliterated the Main Street of Big Whiskey g the impression that the dark, low buildings are scattered random. The only structure with any sign of life is Greel Beer Garden and Billiards which shows a glowing window an two horses out front and that is a hundred yards away fro the struggling silhouettes of the two men on snowshoes. T big one is LITTLE BILL DAGGETT and he is very big, wrappe in a huge bearskin robe. The smaller one is CLYDE LEDBETTER who isn't small though has only one arm.
2) 2) dialog: Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em...an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'... They make their way in silence through the snow, getting close now, close to Greely's and the lights.
3) 6) text: Davey sitting naked on the floor of the bar room and Mike sitting near him, still in his leggings and both men are shivering because they are fifteen feet from the potbelli stove where Clyde is standing watching them. It is a big room, with a crude bar and four tables and so moose and elk heads on the wall. The door near the rear where it says "Billiard Room" leads not to a Billiard Roo but to the six little "rooms" that are the whorehouse and and now you can hear Delilah groaning from there. And Little Bill enters from the back of the bar room, sto to pass through the doorway under the sign that says "Bil Room." Little Bill is huge and ominous. Some say he acquired the bearskin by staring the bear to death and others say he drowned the animal in spit. Anyhow, he's big with a droop moustache and he is sucking on his church warden's clay p and you know he isn't scared of anything. And the two cowboys are scared to death, not just shiveri from the cold, and Bill just looks down at them and sucks his pipe and Alice comes in from the back way too and the Skinny and a couple of the whores gather in the doorway.
