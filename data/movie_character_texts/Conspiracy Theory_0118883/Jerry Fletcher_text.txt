1) 0) text: Behind the wheel:  JERRY FLETCHER.  Flat-out handsome if not for his eyes.  Someone rash, someone making an uninformed decision might call them crazy eyes.  He stops across from an apartment building, TOOTS his HORN.
2) 0) text: Jerry nods, rolls out.  The Cynic watches the door to 1257 close, then sighs.  Jerry looks at him in the rearview.
2) 1) dialog: The sound of love.
2) 3) text: Jerry exhales an exaggerated sigh.
2) 4) dialog: That's love.
2) 6) dialog: I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar.  I saw you kiss.  Admit it, this is the street where love lives.
2) 7) text: The Cynic looks back over his shoulder.  Down love street.  As Jerry hangs a right, the Cynic faces forward.
2) 8) dialog: Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
2) 10) dialog: Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
2) 12) dialog: Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
2) 15) dialog: I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
2) 16) text: Jerry stops at a light.  A road crew are at work ahead. A white strobe light warns motorists that they're here.
2) 18) text: Jerry can't take his eyes off the stroke.  As he blinks.
2) 19) dialog: I don't know.
2) 23) dialog: I never told her.
2) 25) dialog: I, uh, I have some problems.
2) 26) text: The traffic light glows green; Jerry doesn't see it.  The sound of conspiratorial WHISPERS fill the taxi.
2) 28) text: The contents of a syringe pumped into the strapped arm. The walls begin to melt.  The WHISPERS CONTINUE. GARBLED, but their tone is perfectly clear.  Threatening. Cabalistic.  Human forms appear.  Stretched impossibly long, melting along with the walls. We CLOSE ON the reflection of a dozen pair of the same taped-open eyes.  The WHISPERING CUTS SHORT.  Ominously. The eyes dart from side-to-side as FOOTSTEPS approach. The eyes suddenly widen in agony.  As Jerry's scream of pain becomes the BLARE of a HORN, we find ourselves back in the...
2) 31) dialog: The guy came right at us!
2) 33) text: Jerry watches, in a sweat, as he passes a "ONE WAY" sign pointing the opposite way.  He mutters to himself.
2) 34) dialog: I was only going one way.
2) 36) dialog: Look, I'm sorry --
2) 38) text: Jerry pulls to the curb.  The meter at $3.60.  The Cynic slides a twenty through the slot and is out the door. Jerry watches over his shoulder as the Cynic disappears down the street.  Jerry rubs his eyes, tries to regroup.
2) 39) dialog: Love street...
3) 0) text: Late.  The cab rolls, this time the right way.  Ahead, a well-dressed man steps off the curb, flags Jerry down.
5) 0) text: Jerry glances at a lit 2nd floor apartment window, then settles in with a bologna sandwich.  About to take a bite, he pauses, removes a slice of bologna.  He regards it a beat, then carefully peels off the edge.  Jerry holds the narrow casing up against the glow of a streetlight, like it was encoded.  Then something catches his eye.  He trades the sandwich for binoculars, focuses on the window.
5) 2) dialog: captivated, he sighs -- the sound of love.  Then he gets an idea.  Still watching, he fumbles for the RADIO. Turning it ON, he SCANS radio STATIONS.
5) 4) dialog: Never takes his eyes off her, SCANS STATIONS for the elusive number.  He finds ANNIE LENNOX singing "Blue Moon."
5) 6) dialog: (joins in) 'Blue moon, you saw me standing alone...'
5) 8) dialog: His voice trails off as he watches.  Sad, he lowers the binoculars, doesn't want to watch her do this.  Throwing the CAR in GEAR, he takes a last look and drives away.
6) 0) text: A classic corner newsstand except that a river runs down the street and over the curb.  Newspaper stacks usually on the sidewalk are up on milk crates.  The owner, FLIP TANNER, cruises the sidewalk in a battered wheelchair. All sinew and tendons, Flip is black, about 50.  He looks to Jerry's cab plowing twin fountains as it approaches. Flip heaves a stack of newspapers and magazines into his lap.  he rolls to meet Jerry at the curb, hands him the stack through the window.  Jerry looks down at the water.
6) 2) text: Jerry stares back over his shoulder at water gushing out a manhole cover.  Flip watches him, smiles.
6) 4) dialog: Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
6) 6) dialog: Mississippi?
6) 8) dialog: You know, Flip, Vietnam War was  fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
6) 10) dialog: I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
6) 11) text: As Jerry drives away, Flip smiles, shakes his head.
7) 0) text: Carrying his magazines and newspapers, Jerry climbs onto the roof from the fire escape.  He deadpans a look back and forth.  All seems clear.  Jerry starts across.  COOS as Jerry passes a PIGEON coop.  He steps back, opens the door.
7) 1) dialog: It's your choice, fellas.
7) 2) text: As Jerry continues...
8) 0) text: Jerry enters by a window at the fire escape.  Apartment 202.  He checks the seam between the door and casing. The tip of a toothpick is just visible.  Assured, he unlocks the door.  As the toothpick drops, Jerry steps inside.
9) 0) text: Stacked with filled-to-bursting file cabinets.  On the walls, a silvery particle board.  Jerry locks the door, balances an empty beer bottle upside down on the door knob. Satisfied, Jerry enters the file labyrinth.  As he moves we FLASH ON some of the labels, some with not bad cartoon drawings.  "George Bush," "Delta 30," "Blue Flood," "Sirhan2." Jerry turns the corner.  "Nazis & Nutrasweet," "Patti Hearst," and among many more:  "MK Ultra" which features the silhouette of a man holding a handgun & "Council On Foreign Affair" with the C-F-A in heavily Gothic lettering.
9) 2) dialog: The essential goddess death could chain bitter men, (moves words) and crush the ugly moment... like life pounding eggs.
9) 3) text: Jerry opens the fridge to reveal ten padlocked stainless steel containers.  He removes one labeled:  "Tapioca."
10) 0) text: Carrying a bowl of tapioca, Jerry enters.  More files, a manual typewriter.  On the wall, an American flag alongside a poster of John Lennon reading:  "Assassinated
10) 2) text: Jerry scans a New York Times spread on a drafting table. He circles headlines, names and dates.  Does the same with the San Francisco Chronicle, Le Monde, Time, the Economist and Popular Mechanics.  He enters raw data on 3x5 cards:  space shuttle launched, base closings, escape from mental hospital and especially the obituaries. Specifically:  "Industrialist Ernest Hariman Drowns." Jerry flips through 100s of cards on big Rolodexes as he cross-references data.  Jerry pulls cards, lines them up. The first connection:  the dates of six Space Shuttle launches and six earthquakes all coinciding.  Jerry lets out a low whistle.  Never too jaded to be shocked. Jerry types the text of an article, crosses out mistakes. He handcranks copies off an old drum mimeograph.  The hand drawn logo:  lips whispering into an ear.  The title:  "Conspiracy Theory." Jerry writes out five labels.  Addresses from across America.  Jerry slaps the labels on the newsletters.
11) 0) text: The sun comes up. Jerry drops the newsletters into a mailbox.  He starts across the street, then stops, looks back with dread.  He steps back over, checks the slot.  Everything went down. Jerry starts away, then stops again.  As he looks back...
12) 0) text: Jerry passes through the metal detectors.  He stops to stare at the blindfolded Status of Justice.  As a FEDERAL COP steps over to join him.
12) 1) dialog: Smart girl.
12) 3) dialog: She's got a blindfold on.
12) 5) text: Jerry continues to stare.
12) 6) dialog: Depends on your definition...
13) 7) text: A commotion down the hall.  Jerry.  The cop from  downstairs and a second one try everything short of violence to usher him out.
13) 8) dialog: I'm an American and I demand to  see Liza Sutton!
13) 21) text: The guards hesitate.  Wilson nods.  As they let Jerry go...
14) 0) text: In its own way as cluttered and overflowing with files as Jerry's apartment is.  At her desk, Liza watches Jerry pace.  The door is intentionally open.  Liza's secretary JILL keeps a protective eye from the outer office.
14) 2) dialog: Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
14) 4) dialog: Not testing.  Using.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
14) 5) text: As Liza exchanges a look with Jill, Jerry pauses to look at a framed photo on a credenza. Liza, 20, in full riding gear, gracefully jumping a horse over a set of rails.
14) 7) dialog: (re:  photo) Do you still ride?
14) 9) dialog: So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
14) 12) dialog: The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
14) 14) dialog: He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
14) 16) dialog: (nods) Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
14) 17) text: Liza sighs.  On another day, Jerry might have been welcome comic relief.  Not today.  As she folds his map...
14) 18) dialog: You going to warn him?
14) 20) dialog: You think I'm crazy.
14) 22) dialog: You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy against yourself.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on? (a beat) You want to go out sometime?
14) 24) text: Jerry smiles, looks away, embarrassed in an appealingly boyish way.  If he wasn't crazy, the answer might be yes.
14) 25) dialog: I better get going.
14) 28) dialog: What was your horse's name?
14) 30) dialog: Was waiting till I knew you better.  Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
14) 31) text: Jerry heads out.  Liza watches after him a beat as he goes.
15) 0) text: Cordoned off with cops redirecting traffic.  A lake.  Big diesel pumps gush water into the gutters, and the sidewalks are sandbagged.  All the same, water flows over Jerry's sneakers as he flags down a passing PUBLIC WORKS GUY.
15) 1) dialog: Hey, don't water mains usually go in the winter?
15) 3) text: Something catches Jerry's eye -- a tan sedan parked inside the cordon.  Official U.S. Government plates.  As Jerry frowns, two suits, CLARKE and PIPER, exit the subway kiosk, head to the sedan.  Jerry watches, then heads for his cab.
16) 0) text: The sedan pulls up, double parks.  As Piper and Clark head inside, Jerry pulls up across the street.
17) 0) text: Jerry enters, watches Clark and Piper get on the elevator for the 14th to 25th floors.  As the door closes, Jerry steps to a podium with a directory of the building's occupants.  He drops a finger onto a listing.  Floors 18 to 22 are occupied by:  the Central Intelligence Agency.
17) 1) dialog: Spooks.  I knew it.
17) 2) dialog: Grainy black and white as Jerry exits.  Is he being watched?
18) 0) text: Jerry's cab is reflected against the glass.  THROUGH the window, we see Jerry at the counter.  Standing, he throws a few bills down and exits. Jerry reappears in reflection, stops short as Piper is reflected on one side, Clark on the other.  They grab Jerry.  As he struggles Clark jams an air syringe against his neck.  Jerry's reflection goes slack. As they drag him into his cab, a single OLD MAN at the counter looks over, then back to his meatloaf as the yellow of the cab streaks away.
19) 0) text: Strapped to a chair in the middle of what looks like an old hospital room.  Jerry's groggy, starting to regain consciousness.  As he comes round, we hear FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING from the hall.
19) 1) dialog: Two men enter.  They may or may not be Piper and Clark, but we only see their torsos as they move back and forth. We hear a CLOSET OPEN, EQUIPMENT being DRAGGED.  Jerry knows he's righteously fucked.  But he also knows...
19) 2) dialog: I was right.  Wasn't I?  I was right. (a beat) What was I right about?
19) 4) dialog: Are you guys from NASA?
19) 5) text: Without warning, one of the figures grabs Jerry's head from behind, straps it to a slat he attaches to the back of the chair. Jerry struggles, but his head is immobilized.  The second man goes about taping Jerry's eyes open.
19) 6) dialog: I was wrong!  I was wrong!
19) 7) text: Finished, they leave.  Jerry struggles, then finally waits.  A new set of FOOTSTEPS in the hall.  Jerry's eyes follow someone into the room and across from him.  Jerry frowns.
19) 8) dialog: Do I know you?
19) 13) text: A beat as Jonas considers Jerry.
19) 15) dialog: That's great.  Good for you.
19) 17) dialog: Could you be a little more specific?
19) 18) text: Jonas doesn't answer.  Instead, he methodically loads a syringe.  Jerry watches with grave apprehension.
19) 19) dialog: What's that?
19) 21) text: There's nowhere to go, but Jerry still tries to go there as the needle descends.  And then the plunge.
19) 22) dialog: What do I know?...
19) 23) text: Jonas switches on a row of strobe lights.  They flash into Jerry's face.  In between them, on a screen, images.
19) 28) text: Slack-jawed, Jerry doesn't answer.  Jonas holds an electrode to Jerry's leg, touches a second to his side. Jerry arches back as current flows.
19) 32) text: Jerry's only answers are the tears running down his cheeks.  Jonas hits him again. Jerry jerks back so hard the chair snaps right off the floor and topples over backwards.  Jerry's left wrist and right leg burst through the straps which were holding them down.  A wisp of smoke rises. Jonas sighs.  He looks down at Jerry who moans, whispers...
19) 33) dialog: I'll tell you...
19) 34) text: Jonas smiles paternally, steps over.  Jerry's mouth moves, but we can't hear him.  Mr. S flashes on the screen.
20) 0) text: Partially obscured by trees, Jerry does a half-gainer from exactly two stories above the ground.  The chair back takes the brunt of the landing.  Wood splinters.
21) 0) text: Jerry slogs, sinks into asphalt up to his knees.  A truck sets a dumpster down on the street ahead.  As it pulls away, Jerry dashes, grabs hold of a handle on the rear.
22) 0) text: We see the truck approach.  As it turns right, the  centrifugal force flings Jerry off the back and into the oncoming lane.  Several taxis slam on their brakes to keep from running him over. All Jerry sees is yellow.
22) 1) dialog: I'm one of you!  I'm one of you!
24) 1) dialog: Liza Sutton!  I need to see Liza!
24) 2) text: Jerry is being blocked by three FEDERAL COPS.
24) 4) text: As Jerry spots her....
24) 5) dialog: Liza!  This is it.  They just tried to kill me!  I don't know what I know, but it's big!
24) 6) text: They tangle him up, a few feet from his destination. Liza can see that something, real or imagined, has happened. In the struggle, Jerry wrenches free, taking one of the Cops' .45s with him.  He waves them off with it.
24) 7) dialog: Get back!
24) 11) dialog: I bit the bastard's nose off.
24) 13) dialog: Yes!  Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
24) 14) text: As one of the Cops moves to flank, Jerry aims the gun.
24) 15) dialog: (to Cops) It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches! (to Liza) You've got to listen to me.
24) 17) dialog: You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
24) 18) text: Liza sees blood dripping onto Jerry's shoe.  She looks to where he clutches his side, blood oozing out.  To his face.
24) 20) text: Jerry takes his hand from his side, looks at the blood.
24) 21) dialog: I didn't even feel it till a few minutes ago.
24) 22) text: As Jerry's distracted, one of the Cops moves in.  He forces Jerry's gun hand up while the other two Cops take him down.  Jerry struggles till one jams a thumb into a pressure point in his neck.  Jerry winces, collapses.
24) 23) dialog: Who are they?  I don't even know who they are.  But it's on the tip of my tongue.
24) 24) text: And Jerry starts to sob.  As Cop one cuffs him.
24) 28) text: They back off a step, keep him covered.  Jerry continues to sob, desolate.  And Liza, despite herself, puts an arm around him, does what she can to comfort.  Her life's never going to be the same.
26) 2) dialog: What's that?!
26) 4) dialog: I don't want to sleep!  I want to be checked out!
26) 6) text: Jerry looks over at Liza as the Nurse exits.
26) 7) dialog: What's the charge?
26) 11) text: Jerry's suddenly fighting to keep his eyes open.
26) 12) dialog: What a day.  Wish I could tell you so it made sense.
26) 15) dialog: Switch the charts.
26) 17) text: Jerry's as serious as a guy about to pass out can be.
26) 18) dialog: Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
26) 20) text: As Jerry eases back into the mattress.
26) 21) dialog: Wouldn't bet on it.
26) 23) dialog: Hey... (as Liza looks back) I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
26) 25) dialog: Love.
26) 26) text: They look at each other a moment.  Then, as Jerry's eyes flutter.
26) 27) dialog: Switch 'em.
26) 28) text: A long sigh and Jerry's out.  Liza starts out, then stops, laughs at herself as she realizes what she needs to do.  Stepping over, she switches the chart at the foot of Jerry's bed with that of his unconscious roommate. This guy's handcuffed to the bed frame. Liza looks at Jerry a beat, sighs, then exits.
28) 3) text: Fearing the worst, Liza pulls back the sheet.  It's Jerry's roommate.  The guy who got Jerry's chart.
28) 11) text: They think the dead guy is Jerry.  Liza eyes the door.
29) 0) text: Jerry sits in bed, one hand cuffed to the bed rail.
29) 2) dialog: Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
29) 3) text: Liza doesn't answer.  Jerry jubilant.  This is big.
29) 4) dialog: It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
29) 6) dialog: You switched the charts; you tell me.
29) 8) dialog: Really?
29) 9) text: She nods.  Jerry regards the cuff, then her.
29) 10) dialog: I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
29) 12) dialog: You saved my life.
29) 14) text: Liza exits.  Jerry thinks, smiles.  He dips his hand into his oatmeal, smears it across his chin, onto his chest.
30) 10) text: Lowry shushes her.  The sheet is pulled away to reveal Jerry's roommate.  His back still to us, the CIA PSYCHIATRIST is not happy.
30) 15) text: Liza stops short as the Psychiatrist turns around.  His nose is bandaged.  His eyes look right through her.  It's Jonas!  Jerry's man with no nose.
31) 0) text: Covered in oatmeal, Jerry clutches his chest, groans. Three nurses, two orderlies and an INTERN surround him.
31) 4) dialog: No!  Get me to the crash cart!
33) 0) text: A crash.  The Intern staggers back out the door and into the wall.  Jerry exits -- wearing a johnny which flaps as he dashes down the hall.  Bouncing along behind him is the bed's side rail which he's still cuffed to.
34) 0) text: Jerry pounds on the down button.  PING!  The doors on the middle elevator open to reveal Liza, Jonas, et. al... They spot Jerry the same moment he spots them. Jerry drives the rail into one agent's gut, staggering him.  The second agent trying to exit catches the rail in the teeth.  The elevator doors close.
34) 9) dialog: If you knew what really happened to Serpico, you'd be doing everything you could to help me out.
34) 11) text: Obliging, Jerry swings his leg back over.  But he sets his heel on a laundry cart, shoves it hard into the Cop. It gives Jerry a chance to swing the bed rail into the Cop whose gun skitters away as he tumbles back. Jerry tries again to jump down the laundry chute, but the Cop is there, grapples with him.  Jerry finally head- butts him.  As the Cop falls back, releasing Jerry, Jerry falls down the chute.  He jerks to a stop as the bed rail forms a crossbar over the mouth of the chute.
34) 15) dialog: Arf... You gotta help me.
34) 17) text: Liza turns, hears PEOPLE COMING her way.  Deciding, she takes the key ring from the cop's belt, finds the handcuff key.  She slides it into the cuff on Jerry's wrist. They share a long look.  Click.  Jerry drops.  Liza's left holding the rail.  She turns, sees the beds by the wall.
35) 0) text: Jerry the doctor.  In his scrubs, pulls on a paper hair net.
36) 0) text: Two cops on watch at the exits.  Three tired interns on the way out when Jerry joins them.  Just one of the guys.
36) 1) dialog: Did you see that spleen?  I never saw a spleen like that ever.
37) 0) text: Odd looks from the interns, but Jerry's home free.
37) 1) dialog: It was unbespleenable!
41) 1) dialog: They've been coming all day. Nothing I could do about it.
41) 4) dialog: He lies across the back seat, staring up.
41) 5) dialog: Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
41) 7) dialog: Figure of speech.  Could we go?
41) 9) dialog: What took so long?  You were in there all day.
41) 11) dialog: Dead or alive, they'll stick me in  there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
41) 13) dialog: If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
41) 15) dialog: Uh uh, don't want them to see me.
41) 17) dialog: Change lanes.  Then watch your  rearview.
41) 19) dialog: Flat, wraparound headlights?
41) 21) dialog: Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
41) 23) dialog: People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
41) 25) dialog: Yes.
41) 27) dialog: I noticed.
41) 28) text: Liza stops in the middle of the street.  Jerry stays low.
41) 29) dialog: What are you doing?
41) 37) dialog: in the back.  He doesn't like the sound of that.
42) 3) text: Lowry puts it in gear and takes off.  Relieved, Jerry sits up, watches the taillights fade away.
42) 5) dialog: Nothing is easy.
42) 7) dialog: Six months.  Eleven days.
43) 2) dialog: Sorry, Flip. (re:  Liza) Got sidetracked.
43) 3) text: Flip glances at Liza, thinks he understands.  As he winks at Jerry, Liza rolls her eyes to the heavens.  Flip retrieves a double stack of newspapers and magazines.
43) 5) dialog: Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
43) 7) text: Flip smiles as he wheels back over.  He likes Jerry.
44) 0) text: Jerry and Liza by the window.  Jerry hands her the front page of The New York Times.  As Jerry scarfs bread...
44) 1) dialog: Just look at it.  Ten seconds and you'll be scared out of your mind.
44) 2) text: As Liza scans the paper, a waiter sets a small salad in front of her and a big bowl of spaghetti and sausage in front of Jerry.  He digs in like a five-year-old.
44) 3) dialog: (re:  salad) You worked all day for that? Lettuce, tomatoes, no dressing. That's what, you're punishing yourself, right?
44) 4) text: She looks up.  An odd beat.  Is Jerry on to something?
44) 6) dialog: (slurps noodles) Yeah.  I think so.
44) 9) dialog: Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye. (scans it) Hmm... Ahh... (raises eyebrows) Ooooo...
44) 10) text: Liza waits as Jerry spreads out the paper.
44) 11) dialog: More about life on Mars.  From a  rock they found on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
44) 13) dialog: And look here.  Cease fire in Chechenia.  That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons. (scanning article) Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado.  Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.  They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind eye to the future.'
44) 14) text: Jerry grabs a dollar bill from the tip of the adjacent table.  He turns it over, points out the "eye" above the pyramid.
44) 15) dialog: Well that's the eye right there. Money.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
44) 17) text: Jerry takes her hand.  He shakes it, employing various complex machinations.  Finished, he regards her intently.
44) 19) dialog: I have no idea.
44) 22) dialog: I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out. (lowers voice) It must've been in my newsletter.
44) 24) text: Jerry crosses his lips with his finger, shushes her.  He motions her forward so he can whisper.  She leans in. At that moment -- a GUNSHOT! In one motion, Jerry stands, throws his chair through the plate glass window.  As GLASS RAINS down, he's already got one foot out on the sidewalk.  He reaches back for Liza.
44) 25) dialog: Come on!
44) 26) text: Then Jerry sees the waiter, standing nearby, a bottle of wine in one hand, a popped cork in the other -- the source of the sound.  Jerry looks back to Liza.
44) 27) dialog: So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
44) 29) dialog: You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
44) 31) text: Jerry shrugs.  As the manager storms over, Liza peels off a hundred dollar bill.
44) 34) dialog: You know that hour you gave me to impress you?  How much of it is left?
45) 0) text: Liza enters by a window at the fire escape.  Jerry follows.  His side is obviously bothering him.
45) 2) dialog: Flesh wound.  No big deal.
45) 3) text: Jerry heads for the door to his apartment.
46) 0) text: Jerry and Liza enter.  Closing the door behind them, he switches on the light.  Liza looks from the filing cabinets to the silvery particle board covering the walls.
46) 2) text: Jerry doesn't answer as he locks the door, picks the empty beer bottle up off the floor.
46) 3) dialog: You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
46) 5) dialog: The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. Spies.  Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating.  Just like James Bond.
46) 6) text: Jerry sits the beer bottle on the doorknob, turns, heads off.  Liza looks at the bottle, then, "a la Bond"...
46) 10) dialog: You want something to drink?
46) 12) text: Jerry looks back over his shoulder, smiles.
46) 13) dialog: Coffee's our friend.
46) 15) dialog: I keep the beans in the fridge. They stay fresher that way.
46) 16) text: As Jerry removes one of the stainless steel containers, Liza reads some of his magnetic poetry off the door.
46) 18) text: Liza smiles at Jerry who looks up sheepishly from the container.  He's having trouble with the lock.
46) 19) dialog: Forgot the combination... You want some grapefruit juice?
47) 0) text: Jerry enters with Liza.  The photo of Lennon gives her pause.  She looks at the surrounding files then watches as Jerry turns the mimeograph drum, starts printing something.
47) 1) dialog: If my universe had a hub...
47) 3) text: Jerry nods.  Liza steps to the drafting table where Jerry has done several rough, but competent sketches of horses in motion.  There's a book open to a photo of a horse and rider jumping a rail.  Liza closes it, reads:
47) 5) dialog: I've been reading up on it.
47) 7) text: Jerry nods, embarrassed.  As he staples some papers together, Liza stops short.  In the margin of one of the drawings are two small profile sketches of her.  Eyes closed, it looks like she's sleeping.
47) 8) dialog: Here it is.  Conspiracy Theory (proudly hands it over) It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
47) 10) dialog: Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
47) 12) dialog: Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
47) 15) dialog: Pretty scary, huh?
47) 17) dialog: (embarrassed) Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
47) 19) text: Jerry nods, goes about digging one up.  Liza steps to a bookshelf and fifteen different copies of The Catcher in the Rye.
47) 21) dialog: Who?
47) 23) dialog: Never heard of him.
47) 25) dialog: I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
47) 26) text: Strange.  As Liza nods, Jerry opens to a particular page.
47) 27) dialog: (reads) 'I keep picturing all these little kids in this big field of rye... And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff...'
47) 29) dialog: 'If they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them.'
47) 31) dialog: (finishing) 'That's all I'd do all day.  I'd just be the catcher in the rye.'
47) 35) text: Jerry puts a finger over her lips.
48) 0) text: Two black-clad snipers aim at Jerry's window, OPEN FIRE.
49) 5) dialog: Go.
49) 6) text: As Jerry guides Liza down the hatch...
50) 0) text: Dark.  Jerry lands alongside Liza on a mattress.
50) 1) dialog: Always rent a spare apartment!
50) 2) text: Standing, Jerry hauls down on a handle attached to another thin wire.  Really putting his weight into it.
50) 6) dialog: Getting rid of my hub!
50) 7) text: Liza stops short.  The white light from the fuse illuminates the Wonderwall.  Liza stares at a 6x12 painted montage.  One image dominates.  In fact, it's arresting. Bliss:  Liza in full equestrian fear, hands outstretched, head thrown back.  Astride a winged horse.  It soars over a gate and up into the heavens. Jerry has eyes only for the fuse.  As it disappears through the hole in the floor, it takes its light with it.  The Wonderwall goes dark.
52) 0) text: Jerry pulls a jacket from the closet, starts to pull it on.  It's too dark to make out exactly what he's doing. Liza grabs the matches, lights one.  It casts a barely adequate glow on the wall.
52) 2) text: Jerry's wearing a fireman's greatcoat, pulls on a fireman's helmet.  Realizing what she's seen, he's very embarrassed.
52) 3) dialog: Don't know.  It was here when I moved in.
54) 2) text: It's Jerry.  The woman is Liza.  As a path is cleared...
54) 5) dialog: Uh huh.
54) 7) dialog: Never, but I've been practicing.
54) 9) dialog: Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
55) 0) text: Jerry dumps the fireman's coat in the trash, jumps in the BMW as Liza TEARS AWAY from the curb.
58) 0) text: The door opens.  Liza enters followed by Jerry.  An awkward beat as Jerry looks suspiciously about.
58) 3) dialog: You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
58) 5) dialog: Shoot.
58) 7) dialog: (embarrassed) I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
58) 9) dialog: So what's the question?
58) 11) text: Jerry doesn't answer.  He looks around.  Trapped.  Then he spots a particular doorway...
58) 12) dialog: Could I, um, could I look at something?
59) 0) text: Big enough for a chair, bookshelves and a treadmill. Jerry steps onto the treadmill.  Tentatively, like it might swallow him.  He looks forward, then looks back. At... A framed 8X10 photo on the bookshelf:  Liza, maybe 21 years old, in full equestrian gear holding the reins of her horse -- Johnny Dancer.  She stands beside an older man who surely must be her father.  He's also the "Mr. S" from Jerry's bizarre strobe show. Liza stands in the door.
59) 2) dialog: (steps to photo) Is this your dad?
59) 4) dialog: (picks up photo) Is he dead?
59) 6) dialog: How'd he die?
59) 8) text: Liza tries to keep her cool; it's not easy.  Jerry looks from the photo to the treadmill.  It's all suddenly clear.
59) 9) dialog: He's why you punish yourself.
59) 11) dialog: You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
59) 13) text: Jerry realizes he's blown it.  Liza looks out the window, down to the street.
59) 15) text: Jerry counters by pointing out the horse in the photo.
59) 16) dialog: Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
59) 18) text: Forlorn, Jerry sets the picture back down.  The walls of books reminds him of something.
59) 19) dialog: Do you have a copy of that book I can borrow?  Catcher?  I don't usually go this long without one.
59) 22) text: Jerry nods, exits in front of her.  She stays put.  A few moments pass before we hear her front DOOR OPEN and then CLOSE as Jerry leaves.  Liza's eyes flicker over to the treadmill.  A moment and then...
60) 7) text: It's Jerry in the back seat!  But Lowry's a pretty cool customer.  He regards Jerry evenly in the rearview.
60) 10) dialog: Then you must be the smart one. Hands on the steering wheel.
60) 12) dialog: Thank you.
60) 14) dialog: I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
60) 16) dialog: You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
60) 18) dialog: You're here because you figured I might show up.
60) 20) dialog: I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
60) 22) text: Jerry creases the back of his head with the gun barrel. As Lowry slumps unconscious, Jerry starts out, then pauses.
60) 23) dialog: Are you pretending?
60) 24) text: It sure doesn't seem so.  Till Jerry cocks back the hammer.
60) 26) text: Jerry whacks him again.  Jerry's about to go when the front door to Liza's building opens and Liza steps out in her running gear. Jerry crouches, but he needn't bother.  She's not looking his way.  As she takes off down the street:
60) 27) dialog: Shit...
60) 28) text: Jerry pulls Lowry over to the passenger's seat, then climbs into the driver's seat.  He starts the car, then rolls out after her.
60) 31) dialog: She shouldn't be outside at night. What's she doing? (looks to Lowry) I know you can hear me.
61) 0) text: Jerry down the aisles.  Getting desperate.  Finally, the classics section.  Moby Dick.  Pilgrim's Progress.  Of Mice And Men.  Bingo!  The Catcher In The Rye.  One copy left.  Jerry grabs it.  Whew...
61) 2) dialog: Been a long day.
63) 0) text: The clerk hands Jerry his bag, thanks him.  Jerry starts out.  Throwing the bag in the trash, he's out the door.
64) 0) text: Jerry walks down the street, reading. A popular area, there are still quite a few people about. Suddenly the pages flutter in Jerry's hand.  Trash swirls at his feet.  He stops, slowly looks up as he hears the HELICOPTER. Black, no running lights, equipped with a sound damper. It descends quickly over the intersection.  Silky black cords drop.  Traffic snarls as CLEET COMMANDOS slide down. Four of them.  Plainclothed with discreet com-headsets. Wearing jackets, we catch glimpses of the equipment slung on their hips, including machine pistols.  Each has a 2X3 piece of paper taped to his wrist.  Like NFL quarterbacks with the plays, except the papers are photos of Jerry. The helicopter is gone so fast some people haven't even noticed.  The commandos disperse into the crowd, refer to their wrists as they advance in Jerry's direction. Jerry hightails it the opposite way, tries not to attract attention.  He pulls up in front of a movie theater as a second chopper swoops in to drop four more commandos at the south intersection.  The street has been sealed off. Jerry stands there a beat, not sure what to do. Something makes him look across the street where CLEET #1 pulls up, looks over at him.  As CLEET #1 refers to his wrist photo, Jerry dashes into the theater.
66) 0) text: Nearly a full house.  Jerry sits near the front, nervously looking back over his shoulder, watching the aisle. Four CLEETs appear silhouetted at the entrance.  As they start down, checking faces... As the manager drones, people head for the aisles.  Jerry moves for the emergency exit.  Sticking out like a sore thumb as the emergency door opens and a shadowy figure steps inside the alcove.  A CLEET commando. He spots Jerry, starts forward.
66) 2) text: Jerry starts back through what's been an orderly proceeding.
66) 3) dialog: Bomb!  There's a bomb in here!
66) 4) text: As the cry of "Bomb!" gets taken up, panic spreads.  No one gets trampled, but the shoving is fierce.  As the CLEETs fight their way down, Jerry heads for the rear exit.  A few other patrons go that way as well.
67) 0) text: Jerry exits with a solid head-start, but as he turns there's a CLEET in the alley.  Checking faces -- not looking Jerry's way yet.  Jerry keeps close behind another patron, then darts out, swings the CLEET face first into the wall. As the CLEET draws his machine-pistol, Jerry slams his face once, twice into the wall.  As the CLEET drops, Jerry makes eye contact with a woman who watches aghast.
67) 1) dialog: I didn't like his looks.  Did you?
67) 2) text: As she shakes her head "no," Jerry continues on his way.
71) 2) dialog: Observing the van through a pair of binoculars.  It's difficult to say where he is.
72) 0) text: Jerry stands at the window, looking through a small telescope.
75) 3) text: Sighing, Liza opens her briefcase, pulls out the Conspiracy Theory newsletter and Jerry's subscriber list. Sitting at her desk, she turns on her computer.
76) 0) text: Lunchtime.  A big crowd on the street.  Among them -- Jerry.  He wears a baseball cap, heads right for the van.
76) 1) dialog: Can't see the forest for the trees.
76) 2) text: He holds a six inch length of steel rebar and a coil of wire cable.  He passes the van.  No one in the front.  At the rear quarter, Jerry bends down to tie his shoes.
79) 0) text: Where they listen, unaware of Jerry.
80) 0) text: On one end, the cable is sinched around the middle of the length of the rebar.  Jerry slides the bar through the center hole of a manhole cover.  The other end has a loop which he attaches to the van's undercarriage.  Shoes tied, Jerry rises, continues on his way.
85) 0) text: Jerry waits as the bus approaches, stops.  Down the street, the cops approach the van.  Smiling, Jerry boards the bus.
86) 0) text: Jerry walks to the back, sits beside Liza.
86) 1) dialog: Did you see the van back there?
86) 3) dialog: Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
86) 5) dialog: I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
86) 7) dialog: You haven't been bothering them, have you?
86) 9) dialog: Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on. (realizes) I'm passing it to you, too.
86) 11) dialog: Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
86) 13) dialog: Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.
86) 16) dialog: There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one. 
86) 18) dialog: So now they feed us terrorists. To create fear.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
86) 20) dialog: Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
86) 22) dialog: His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
86) 24) dialog: Right here in Manhattan.
86) 26) dialog: Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
87) 0) text: Jerry and Liza stand amidst the hustle and bustle.
87) 1) dialog: Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
87) 3) dialog: I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
87) 5) dialog: Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
87) 7) dialog: They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
87) 9) dialog: You will?
87) 11) text: She means it sincerely.  She'll help.  Jerry's touched.
87) 12) dialog: I don't know what to say. (blurts) I love you.
87) 14) text: A spontaneous moment.  Jerry's barely sure he said it.
87) 15) dialog: I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way. (shrugs) Everything you do is magic.
87) 17) dialog: I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
87) 19) dialog: Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
87) 21) dialog: What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
87) 23) dialog: Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
87) 25) text: Jerry shakes his head.
87) 26) dialog: You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
87) 28) dialog: Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
87) 30) dialog: It's Geronimo.  Love. It lets you see things.  It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
87) 33) text: Jerry looks away.
87) 35) dialog: I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
87) 37) dialog: I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
87) 38) text: Jerry starts off through the crowd.
87) 40) text: Jerry starts to run. Liza starts after him, but she runs into a commuter, then another.  Jerry's lost in the crowd. The subway is about to leave.  As Jerry gets on, Liza spots him.  The doors close.  The train rolls.  She moves alongside, tries to get his attention, but he won't look over.
89) 0) text: The same place where Jerry followed Clarke and Piper in the beginning.  As Liza enters...
90) 0) text: Liza steps to the building's directory, slides a finger across.  The Central Intelligence Agency occupies the 18th to the 22nd floors.  Just like Jerry saw.  Liza drops her finger down... The 24th floor -- The International Fund For Mergers and Acquisitions.
93) 64) text: Liza looks up at the ceiling, the walls.  Like a bird in a cage as it sinks in.  She blinks out a tear.  Another. No place to hide.  Jerry.
94) 3) dialog: Smiles grimly.
94) 4) dialog: At least someone's finally taking me seriously.
94) 5) text: Spotting something below, Jerry raises the telescope.
94) 7) dialog: Checks his watch, smiles.  Pizza's right on time.  He turns, starts out.  A hand clamps down on his shoulder.
94) 9) text: WIDEN to include a BIG MAN. As Jerry balls a fist ...
95) 0) text: Liza exits carrying the pizza.  MOVE WITH her as she heads to the NE corner.  She has no sooner raised her hand when a Yellow Cab pulls up at the curb.  Jerry behind the wheel.
95) 1) dialog: Where to, lady?
102) 0) text: Liza instinctively sits as close to the door as possible. Not noticing, Jerry grabs a piece of pizza, eats.
102) 1) dialog: It's good.  Have some.
102) 3) dialog: How'd they like that thing about the pope?  I made it up.  Threw it in there to get 'em going.
102) 5) dialog: You look great.
102) 8) dialog: Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
102) 10) dialog: It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
102) 11) text: Jerry checks his rearview mirror, looking for the car. Liza feigns ignorance.
102) 13) dialog: There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
102) 14) text: Jerry leans forward to look upwards through the windshield.
102) 15) dialog: And somewhere up top, a chopper.
102) 17) dialog: They think they're so smart... Actually, they are.
107) 0) text: Flanking as Jerry thought, they turn left ahead of where Sedan One is stuck in traffic.
110) 2) dialog: Not today.
112) 0) text: Halfway across it.  Without warning, Jerry locks it up, whips the wheel around.  Liza screams as the cab slides sideways.
113) 0) text: HORNS BLARE.  The cab blocks traffic.  Jerry exits, shouts for Liza to follow.  The grabs the pizza box, joins him at the center guardrail.
113) 2) dialog: This way.
113) 3) text: Jerry climbs over the median, drops over to the other side.  He holds out his hand.  She pauses, then takes it. As she goes over, she drops the pizza box.  She reaches for it, but Jerry pulls her along.
113) 4) dialog: Forget it!  I'll buy you another one!
113) 6) dialog: After you. (as she hesitates) It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
113) 8) dialog: Connecticut.
113) 10) text: Jerry takes her arm, guides her in.
113) 11) dialog: I don't mean to be mysterious, but you'll know when we get there.
113) 12) text: Jerry, behind the wheel, STARTS the CAR.  Suddenly, he stares to the left, transfixed.  Liza follows his gaze, but the only thing apparent are the three red-and-white smokestacks of the Con-Edison plant. But before Liza can ask, Jerry snaps out of it. The front-wheel-drive digs in.  The jack spits loose and the rear end hits the asphalt.  As they blend into traffic.
117) 0) text: The abandoned car drives off the bridge.  Jerry and Liza go completely unnoticed.  PULL BACK AS they become a very small needle in a very big haystack.
119) 0) text: Jerry drives.  The RADIO PLAYS SOFTLY.  Liza sits as far over as possible.  Quiet, then finally...
119) 1) dialog: Ted Bundy.  David Berkowitz. Richard Speck.
119) 4) dialog: How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John Wilkes Booth. Mark David Chapman.  Lee Harvey Oswald.
119) 6) dialog: (without hesitation) Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
119) 7) text: Jerry smiles, but she doesn't smile back.  As he concentrates on his driving... Liza eases her little cell phone out of her pocket. Holding it at her side, half-turning away from Jerry, she flips it open, turns it on.  Enter a pre-dial code: "WILSON" flashes across the display.  As Liza holds her thumb over the ear speaker-holes...
121) 0) text: Liza sees the light go out on the phone.  Shit.  She glances at Jerry, hits redial.
125) 2) text: Jerry doesn't answer.
125) 4) text: Jerry pulls over, stops alongside the woods.
126) 1) dialog: Haven't you figured it out yet?
126) 4) dialog: Come on.
126) 5) text: Liza takes a last look at the cell phone antennae sticking out from the seat and follows Jerry out.  They head into the woods, he a bit behind her.
127) 0) text: The trees thin.  Liza and Jerry step out, start to walk along the side of an old barn.
127) 1) dialog: How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
127) 6) dialog: You know who was the first President to be assassinated? George Washington.  His doctor bled him to death.
127) 7) text: They near the rotten boards.  Jerry's behind and to Liza's right.  She's leading him into a trap.
127) 8) dialog: There's a fraternity of secrecy. And anyone trying to expose it is labeled a hopeless paranoid.
127) 9) text: As she's about to skirt the edge of the well, Jerry suddenly leaps forward, grabs her.  She nearly screams.
127) 10) dialog: Watch out!
127) 11) text: Jerry gestures at the rotting boards, thinks he saved her.
127) 12) dialog: You could've fallen down there.
127) 15) text: Jerry looks over, cocks his head kind of funny.
127) 16) dialog: What do you mean?  Liza?
127) 18) dialog: Liza?
127) 20) dialog: Is that what they told you?
127) 22) text: Jerry shakes his head.  Liza wants to believe him, but...
127) 24) dialog: He gave it to me.
127) 26) dialog: Where were you the day he died?
127) 28) dialog: That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
127) 30) dialog: No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
127) 33) dialog: Yeah.  I know what it's like.
127) 35) dialog: Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
127) 37) dialog: I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad. (a beat) I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
127) 39) dialog: To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was. (beat) But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
127) 40) text: There's a sincerity in Jerry's voice that's hard to ignore.
127) 42) dialog: He kept it in the side table in the front hallway. (off her look) He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
127) 44) dialog: Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
127) 46) text: Jerry looks away, can't answer.
127) 48) dialog: (a whisper) Because he believed me.
127) 51) dialog: Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
127) 53) dialog: I told him I'd keep you safe.  I took the picture and I've been watching you ever since. (a beat) Please don't cry.
127) 54) text: Liza looks at Jerry.  He looks like he's on the verge of tears himself.  She's not afraid of him anymore.  But more important than that...
127) 56) dialog: You do?
127) 59) dialog: They'll trace it.
127) 61) dialog: (smiles) It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
127) 64) text: A third light.  This one from a helicopter descending. Blinded by lights, Jerry knows there's nowhere to run this time.  He raises his hands, laces them behind his head.
127) 66) text: Jerry squints over at her.

127) 69) dialog: Go get it.  And when you got it, keep going.
127) 71) text: Members of the CLEET Unit step in.  Two from either side. They grab Jerry, cuff him and start him toward the helicopter.
127) 73) text: CLEET #1 shoves her back.  Jerry dips, drives his shoulder into CLEET #1's back.  He looks back over his shoulder at Liza.  Not worried about himself.
127) 74) dialog: Go get it.
127) 75) text: The CLEETs pound him.  The chopper touches down, the door thrown open.  As Wilson gets off, Jerry is hustled past him and onboard.
128) 0) text: Jerry struggles.  Jammed into a corner, he watches after Liza, his face pressed against the glass.
128) 2) text: Jerry's not listening.  He only has eyes for Liza.  Down below, her legs churn her toward the house.
128) 4) dialog: (ready to burst) Liza!
128) 6) dialog: (chokes it out) You've never seen her run.
128) 7) text: Liza disappears as darkness swallows the scene. Helpless, hopeless, Jerry pounds his forehead against the glass.  Jonas watches, amused, till Jerry finds the strength to lunge at him.  As Jerry's driven down to the deck...
139) 4) dialog: Strapped to a metal chair in front of blinding white lights.  Only now, it's really happening.  Jonas steps over, an electrode in either hand.  Jerry's chin is down on his chest.  He's already been through the ringer.
139) 5) dialog: Monkey finger.  Shoot Coca-Cola.
139) 8) text: Jerry just blinks back at him.
139) 10) dialog: Then I can't be hurt anymore.
139) 11) text: Jerry squeezes his eyes shut.  As tears roll down his cheeks, Jonas fires up the juice.
140) 0) text: A sink and dirty mattress on the floor.  Two CLEETs drag in Jerry.  Unconscious, he's dumped on the floor by a narrow heating duct.  They leave, lock the door behind them.  Jerry doesn't move, doesn't make a sound.  A rag doll.
145) 0) text: Liza pulls her BMW over to the side, gets out and goes to the rail.  She stares across at the three red-and-white smokestacks of the Con-Ed plant.  The view through the window in Jerry's room. Liza scans the riverfront buildings on Roosevelt Island across from the plant.  There are only a few that would match and one stands out from the rest...
152) 0) text: Jerry's still lying on the floor where he was left.  But he's starting to stir.  Feeling like he was already dead, maybe even wishing he was.
154) 1) dialog: Blue moon...  Blue moon...
155) 4) text: Liza waves them off.  It's hopeless.  She stops at a chicken-wired window at the end of the hall, looks out. Light's about to break and Jerry's out there somewhere.
155) 10) dialog: (singing) Blue moon... Blue moon...
156) 0) text: We hear LIZA'S DISTANT "JERRY," but it doesn't register with Jerry.  He's all inside now.

158) 0) text: Jerry moves closer to the vent as the two of them sing their "duet."  She's alive.  It finally, really sinks in.

160) 0) text: Jerry has crawled his way over to the sink.
160) 1) dialog: Diversion.  Need a diversion.
160) 3) dialog: Liza's coming.  Gotta look sharp.
160) 4) text: Jerry runs a hand through his hair, collapses.
162) 0) text: His feet braced against the wall, Jerry pulls on a PIPE under the sink.  It GROANS, CREAKS, and then SNAPS. Water geysers up.  Jerry sputters out of the way.
165) 0) text: Jerry holds a toilet lid over the glass.  Another RAP.
165) 2) text: The BOLTS BEING SLID BACK.  Jerry stumbles as the door is pushed open.  The Guard enters, leading with his 9mm.
165) 3) dialog: You had to see for yourself, didn't you?
165) 5) text: The Guard is unaware that Liza has appeared in the doorway behind him.  Jerry smiles.
165) 6) dialog: Right where we are now.
165) 7) text: The Guard steps forward to let Jerry have it.  He freezes at the HAMMER CLICKING back on the .38.
165) 11) text: The Guard turns.  As he does, Jerry raises the toilet lid, cracks it down over the top of the Guard's head. The exertion sends Jerry sprawling, as well.  He looks up.
165) 12) dialog: So, what do you think?  Is something going on here or what?
166) 0) text: Jerry (armed with the 9mm) and Liza exit.  Liza slides the bolts back on the door.  Footsteps and voices ahead. Jerry leans on Liza as they start their escape in the opposite direction.  They've just disappeared around one corner when Jonas and CLEETS #3 and #4 appear around the corner.
167) 0) text: A man approaches from one end of the sidewalk.  Flip, the black owner of the newsstand Jerry frequents.  No longer wheelchair-bound.  As he converges with Agent Lowry.
169) 0) text: Jerry and Liza make their way along.  Ahead, a CLEET crossing the intersection.  SHOTS are exchanged.  Liza and Jerry hug the wall, move back the way they came.  As the CLEET gets on his headset, they duck down...
169) 2) dialog: This way.
170) 2) text: A 2-foot by 2-foot sliding door on the wall.  Padlocked. Jerry aims, SHOOTS the lock off.  He opens the door to reveal a dumbwaiter.
170) 4) dialog: I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
170) 5) text: Jerry hits a button on the wall.  Nothing.  No power. Liza looks back over her shoulder at distant gunfire.
170) 7) text: BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  She spins as Jerry FIRES into the wall.  He tears plaster back in huge chunks to reveal the dumbwaiter mechanism.  A looped bicycle chain, running over teeth on a motor below and disappearing up a shaft above. He kicks the bottom loop off the motor.
170) 8) dialog: Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
170) 10) dialog: Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me.  Now.
170) 13) text: Jerry and Liza freeze.  The voice is close.  Liza starts to climb out, but Jerry holds her back, whispers.
170) 14) dialog: Geronimo.
170) 17) dialog: It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
170) 19) text: Jerry hauls down again. Liza disappears from view.  He clutches his side in pain.  Then he hauls again.
170) 24) dialog: Too good to be true.  Last thing I do.  Like life pounding eggs.
170) 32) dialog: Liza...
170) 33) text: Jerry drops his gun, corkscrews down into a broken heap. His eyes flutter up as Jonas looms over him.
170) 44) text: Jonas looks back over his shoulder just in time for a bullet to drill his forehead above his left eye.  He's dead before he hits the ground. And Liza is at Jerry's side.  One look and she knows it isn't good.
170) 48) dialog: I can't promise you anything.
170) 51) dialog: Top pocket...  Go on.
170) 53) dialog: Remember when you gave me that?  A hundred dollar bill to get lost? (re:  bill) That's it.  My lucky charm.
170) 55) dialog: They changed Franklin's portrait.
170) 57) dialog: Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
170) 60) text: Jerry smiles.  Liza smiles back.  Then:
170) 61) dialog: (almost apologetic) I don't know why I love you.  But I know that I do.
170) 64) dialog: (a sigh) Now she tells me.
170) 65) text: Overwhelmed, Jerry squeezes his eyes shut.  Liza turns back as Agent Lowry appears.
171) 0) text: A madhouse.  Police arriving in droves.  Jerry in the back of the ambulance.  Liza watches, horrified, as his body jerks as they defibrillate him.  The back doors close.
172) 0) text: A beautiful day.  Maybe not a bad place to end up after all.  We COME UPON a particular stone, freshly turned earth on the grave.  Jerry Fletcher.  He didn't make it. Liza stands here all alone.  Paying her last respects.
174) 0) text: His chest bandaged, tubes running in and out, Jerry looks up as Lowry and Flip enter.  He's weak, but very much alive.  They look at him.  He looks back as defiantly as his situation will allow.
174) 1) dialog: Flip.  Howard Hughes gave you your legs back.
174) 4) dialog: I'm leaning toward no.
174) 8) text: Jerry stares back.  That may be the truth.
174) 9) dialog: I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
174) 11) dialog: That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
174) 13) dialog: Then screw you.  I'll rot.
174) 15) dialog: Whatever.
174) 17) dialog: Flip. (as Flip looks back) You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
178) 0) text: Jerry sits with Lowry and Flip, scans with binoculars.
178) 1) dialog: I see her car, but -- Oh...
180) 0) text: Jerry, holding his breath, lets it out in a long sigh, the sound of love.  He smiles sadly, lowers the binoculars.
180) 1) dialog: She's okay. (to Lowry; grim) Let's go.
182) 0) text: Liza gallops out into the sun.  Feeling it, remembering, realizing just how much she missed this.  But now she has it again.  A gift. Head back, she holds her arms out in hope and faith, very much like the painting on Jerry's Wonderwall. FREEZE FRAME.
