13) 0) text: The morning meeting yet to begin.  Lawyers wait as, THROUGH the glass, treadmill girl Liza Sutton argues with brusque department head WILSON.  It's a screaming match, though on this side of the glass their VOICES are MUFFLED THUMPS.  Liza waves her arms.  Wilson shakes his head emphatically. As they continue to argue, a YOUNG LAWYER arrives being shown the ropes by an OLDER LAWYER.
13) 1) dialog: This is the conference room.  We start 9 AM sharp.  Usually.
13) 3) dialog: Wow.  How long till I can talk like that to Mr. Wilson?
13) 4) dialog: About a thousand years.  That's Liza Sutton.  You heard of the federal judge?  Tom Sutton? Assassinated a few years ago?
13) 5) dialog: By that cult leader who's in prison, right?  Ezekiel Walters. The one who blew up the Citibank Building.
13) 6) dialog: None of it ever proven.  But Sutton did deny Ezekiel a writ of habeas corpus.  Anyhow, Liza is Sutton's daughter.
23) 0) text: Liza's in the back next to, but not with, one of the Lawyers seen earlier.  He seems nice enough.
23) 1) dialog: So, you doing anything tonight?
23) 3) dialog: Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
23) 5) dialog: Night after that?
23) 7) dialog: I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
74) 0) text: Liza strides down the hall.  LAWYERS, seen earlier in the conference room, are talking.  One looks over as Liza nears.
74) 1) dialog: Liza, settle a bet for us.
