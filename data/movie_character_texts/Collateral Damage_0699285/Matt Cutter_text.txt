This one is his, this one is safe at home and unafraid: what a father wants for his child. We see the deep affection Gordy has for his son. He holds Matt tightly, skin to skin, and kisses the boy's wet head... Anne opens the shower door.       She's on the phone.
15) 7) text: She leads Matt out. Closes the shower door. Gordy sticks his face into the water. Looks back, finds... Two bare butts, Anne's and Matt's, are pressed against the shower door's foggy glass. OFF Gordy, laughing --

One by one the first and second bagpipers finish their rounds, until there is just the third -- a haunting, mournful wail off into the distance. And then... There's only silence.
