1) 1) dialog: But sex... You are twenty three. Not an easy age for abstinence, is it?

1) 7) dialog: My dear boy, if you were to become Tolstoy's private secretary, you would be given a great gift. You'll be with him every day, eat together, walk in the forest by his side. It's difficult to contain himself.

His children can't be trusted... only Sasha... and then of course there is the Countess...

1) 20) text: And although they've allowed me to return to Russia, I can't see him. They keep me under house arrest... They might as well keep me in a cage. Clearly upset, Chertkov pauses to get control of himself. He picks up a package, hands it to Valentin. CHERTKOV
