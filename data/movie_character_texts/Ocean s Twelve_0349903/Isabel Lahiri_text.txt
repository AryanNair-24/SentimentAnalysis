53) 0) text: Europol Agent ISABEL LAHIRI gives a presentation to seven five of her colleagues. With her on stage are a couple of seated HIGHER-UP TYPES. She's nervous.
53) 1) dialog: Let's discuss, briefly and to begin, with the category of "thieves", as distinguished from the larger category of what might be termed "hardened" criminals. The highest level, "master thieves," if you will, is a very small world. Between six and ten high-level crews are operating in Europe at any given time. Worldwide, no more than twenty. The most famous, Gaspar LeMarc, is either dead or retired, and the expectation is that no one will replace him. The good news is the trend is toward their extinction.
53) 5) dialog: For example: Anecdotal evidence suggest these people are personally insufferable. The Higher-Ups look at each other; what did she just say?
53) 6) dialog: Their egos demand constant praise, and they embellish their exploits to anyone who will listen. They tell their own stories endlessly, provided of course, they are talking to a fellow thief or an intimate. Many in the audience are now looking to each other, wonde if this is appropriate.
53) 7) dialog: Those who interact with them on a personal level are relegated to positions of total servitude, with no chance for growth or freedom. Their lives are treated as secondary. Many of them suffer from depression. It's a crime for which there is no law, and yet causes untold damage. One of the Higher-Ups convinces the other to say somethin but by now Hess the Male Secretary has reached Isabel and interrupts her by whispering into her ear. She balances. ISABEL (cont'd) (amplified by the lectern mic)
54) 4) dialog: That's impossible!
55) 0) text: Isabel arrives and is greeted by PAUL, a lead detective working the Vanderspeigle theft for the Amsterdam police department.
55) 2) dialog: I hope the scene hasn't been contaminated. Isabel walks away. Moments later, she enters the house wi the lead detective.
56) 1) dialog: No forced entry.
56) 9) dialog: No, that would have triggered the system. Isabel goes to the alarm pad. Pulls the face plate off, examines the inside. ISABEL (cont'd)
56) 12) dialog: They had to have known the code. She moves on to look in the mark's BEDROOM.
56) 14) text: We considered that, but the mark swears that nobody in the world knew the code except him. He programmed the last seven steps of the system himself. He set it and never left the house again. When he dies, we'll probably have to physically cut all the power lines to the house to get it off line. Isabel examines the computer brain of the alarm system wh was locked inside a titanium case in Vanderspeigle's bedr closet. She answers the detective almost as an afterthoug
56) 15) dialog: There are other ways to get the code. (to herself)
56) 21) dialog: Uh...well, they probably set up in a house across the canal and watched him type the code in through a pair of binoculars. We GO WITH HIM as he walks back into the office. He stand at the alarm panel and pretends to type in the code. He twists around and looks out the window behind him.
56) 23) text: Actually, I don't know about that. Isabel re-enters the office. PAUL (cont'd)
56) 26) dialog: That's why they probably set up over there-- She points out an adjacent window on another wall. ISABEL (cont'd)
56) 27) text: --And used the mirror. She points at a small mirror on the opposite wall. The detective bends down so his eye is at the level of the keypad, then he looks in the mirror. He can see directly across the canal into another house. ISABEL (cont'd)
56) 28) text: I'm guessing they'd need a fifteen hundred millimeter lens to get a clear shot but-- But Isabel's already moved on. Something has caught her attention just above the alarm panel: a patch of paint th is shinier than the paint that surrounds it.
56) 35) text: What is that? Isabel cooks her head again.
56) 38) dialog: It's where the crossbow bolt hit.
56) 40) dialog: Ever heard of Franz Schuman?
56) 45) dialog: They would have fired from that roof. Through this open window. Isabel kneels down, checks the line-of-sight to make sure she's correct.
56) 47) dialog: Not a cop, anyway.
56) 49) dialog: Sorry. Your friend downstairs put me in a bad mood.
56) 51) dialog: Yes. You're right. Isabel pulls out a notepad and writes the name: "Eugene `Basher' Tarr." There are two names above Basher's in her little book: "Robert Ryan" and "Danny Ocean." ISABEL (cont'd)
56) 60) dialog: When did he get up and notice the certificate was gone?
56) 62) dialog: But the alarm would have been--
56) 63) text: She stops.    And smiles to herself. ISABEL (cont'd) Oh... Oh, I know what happened.
56) 65) text: Isabel quickly glances around the room.       Her eye lan floor near the false bookcase.
56) 69) dialog: There was someone else.
56) 72) dialog: Oh, I wish I could've have seen that.
57) 1) dialog: That must have really been something. Suddenly:
57) 43) dialog: I'm sure there's another scenario that would fit these physical details, but I don't know what it is.
57) 48) dialog: You can start by picking that guy up.
59) 0) text: Isabel arrives.
60) 0) text: Isabel is waiting to be processed. Eventually, she is directed down a hallway.
61) 0) text: We LOOK through a one-way mirror into the interrogation r where detectives Onderdonk and Devenpeck are trying the b cop / bad cop routine on Evelyn. Isabel walks INTO FRAME and watches: Onderdonk slams his on the table. Davenpeck shouts in Evelyn's face. Evelyn just laughs.
61) 7) dialog: Can I speak to him? The two detectives look at each other.
61) 11) dialog: Oh no. I just need to speak with him. To get some information.
61) 15) dialog: I'm sure. I only need a moment, then I'll be out of your way.
62) 9) dialog: (to Rusty)
62) 10) text: Hello, Robert. Rusty spins to see Isabel.
62) 18) dialog: Is it? Because you've been seeing a lot of me lately. She hands a surveillance photo to Rusty.
62) 19) dialog: You were sitting in a Mercedes outside my apartment on Wednesday night. She hands Rusty another photo. (These are the photos Hess male secretary showed her at Europol HQ that we couldn't see.)
62) 23) dialog: You were hiding in the bushes when I had lunch yesterday at Trattoria Bella. She hands him a third photo.   Looks at the fourth.
62) 24) dialog: This one...I'm not even sure where this one was taken, but I like it a lot. Very Ron Gallela. She hands this photo to Danny. It's a picture of Rusty, w a dorky look on his face, peering out from behind a mailb he's using as cover while he spies on Isabel.
62) 25) dialog: I mean, if I didn't know better I'd think you all came here to steal the Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift, also known as the world's first stock certificate. (to the group as a whole)
62) 28) dialog: And the Palowski...whose idea was that? She knows it was Rusty.
62) 30) dialog: Oh...I know you didn't. Somebody beat you to it. One man. No crew. No back up. Tell me something -- just so I can get the full picture in my head -- was he wearing a tuxedo? A white dinner jacket?
62) 36) dialog: So you know who he is?
62) 38) dialog: Well, then. I'll see you when you see him. To get your certificate back. She takes the photo of Rusty peeking from behind the mail from Danny's hand. She walks out. The group is frozen. Livingston is still looking at the pictures of Rusty following Isabel.
63) 0) text: Isabel is talking to her superior.
63) 2) dialog: I don't have twenty-four hours. They're there now. They'll lead me to him.
64) 0) text: Isabel exits.
64) 2) dialog: Yes.
64) 4) dialog: Let's share a car.

78) 0) text: Isabel and Hess heading into Paris.

79) 0) text: The Bureaucrat looks at Isabel. All of her.
80) 0) text: Isabel sits in the back with Hess.
86) 0) text: The motorcade is completely stopped in traffic. In a nearby sedan, Isabel sits next to an Italian CARABIN LIAISON of same sort. Hess is in the front seat.
86) 1) dialog: I'm going to need surveillance on both hotels, phone taps, room bugs, people in the lobby and by every exit.
86) 3) dialog: If I had to guess I'd say I'll need at least 25 people, a dozen vehicles...and an on-call air unit.
86) 5) dialog: Okay, one more thing, and this is crucial: these guys are extremely, sophisticated at avoiding electronic surveillance, so we'll need real state of the art stuff.
86) 11) dialog: Okay. Good. Now what time am I meeting Captain Giordano?
86) 14) dialog: No, what time?
86) 17) text: Isabel looks right at him.
86) 18) dialog: I see...so...you've spoken with the Pope and he's okay with autographing my breasts?
86) 21) text: Isabel sighs loudly and sinks back into her seat.
91) 0) text: Isabel enters her room. Suddenly she spins and draws her pistol.   Her gun ends up in Rusty's face.
91) 1) dialog: Jesus, Robert. I could've killed you. He shrugs. A long beat as she takes a look at him.
91) 3) dialog: I hope so. What are you doing in my room?
91) 5) dialog: No, thanks.
91) 7) dialog: Please don't.
91) 12) dialog: Why do I want to have coffee with you?
91) 15) dialog: She hated you.
91) 17) dialog: She hated everybody. Rusty nods.    He remembers.
91) 18) dialog: You'll never get it by the way.
91) 20) dialog: You'll think you've got it, you'll be so close that you'll be able to taste it and then this guy, the Night Fox or whoever he is, will just take it -- right out of your hand -- just like he did in Amsterdam. He's as good as LeMarc.
91) 22) dialog: You're in a bubble.
93) 0) text: A SUBORDINATE OFFICER leads Isabel down a hallway.
93) 5) dialog: What are they talking about?
95) 0) text: Isabel's sitting on the couch now, her eye lids drooping. Hess checks his PDA.
97) 0) text: Isabel is asleep on the couch. It's 5:30 PM. A hand taps her shoulder. She wakes up and is shocked to see Captain Giordano, finally, standing above her.

97) 7) dialog: ...reason to believe these men... (lays out photos of Danny, Rusty, and Toulour)
97) 10) dialog: And I'll need substantial resources from your department. Can I count on that?

102) 1) dialog: Hi, this isn't official business. Actually, I'm here on vacation. But I was sitting in a cafe this afternoon, near the Piazza Navona and...the police were chasing someone on foot. I was just wondering if you caught him or...do you know anything about that case?
102) 6) dialog: Oh...
103) 0) text: Isabel sits in the same seat the next day, reading the newspaper, enjoying her vacation. She looks up and stops cold. Rusty, all cleaned up now, dressed in a perfectly-tailore suit, sits down three tables away from her. She stares at him. Can't believe it. The brazenness. The audacity of this guy. Rusty doesn't seem to have a care i the world as he chats easily with the waiter, in Italian. Finally, Isabel just can't help herself.   She gets up an walks over to Rusty's table.

105) 6) dialog: Stop it.

111) 5) dialog: Another camera here and here. And have a guard here at all times so any attempt to disable the system will be detected. All your IR devices need to be fitted with reflective faces otherwise a UV later can be used to burn the sensors out.

130) 25) dialog: Then why aren't you as good as Toulour? Rusty shrugs. A beat.
130) 29) dialog: I don't want to arrest you, Robert. I really don't. But I will if you make me. I will if you go for that egg. Rusty goes silent, looks out at the lights of the city.
