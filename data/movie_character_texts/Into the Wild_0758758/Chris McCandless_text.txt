We TILT DOWN a stack of books sitting on the floor - Tolstoy, Stegner, Thoreau, Jack London, and Pasternak. Beside them, a camper's backpack. Chris sits in introspection at his desk by candlelight. The room is spare, supporting his monkish lifestyle. But on the desk before him, he counts out $500.68 from a bank envelope. He pockets those bills and change, then removes a check for $24,000 made out to OXFAM America from the same bank envelope. He scribbles a note: These are all my savings. Feed someone with it. Signed, Chris McCandless. He then slides the note and the check into a pre-addressed Oxford Famine Relief Fund (in Boston) envelope. He pulls his wallet from his back pocket. Pulls all the cards and pictures from its sleeves. Considering each, he flicks them into a trash bin, one by one. Finally coming to his social security card, he holds it to the candles flame. As the flame burns bright we -

But this rumble is not thunder. It rapidly builds into an alarming ROAR. The roar grows to a deafening level. Chris awakens.
12) 0) text: What remains of Chris' travelling money burns in a pile beside the Datsun on the sun-lit but muddy desert floor. We follow a very long set of footprints (CAMERA TRACKING/TRUE VERTICAL) away from the burning cash through the mud, finally tilting up to the footprint maker, Chris. Slogging toward high ground. WIDE-SHOT: We see the abandoned Datsun nearly a mile behind Chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack. He comes very close to camera (only a day or two's stubble on his face) and as we PAN him 180, we see as much wilderness before us as we did behind.

Your humble reporter, Chris McCandless will now struggle with the journalistic question of ethics: Will he retain his reporter's objectiveness or save the future of human truth by slaying this awful beast?

As he arrives, the monster appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having pulled off the board Chris had nailed. CHRIS (CONT'D)

14) 12) text: When we were little, Chris was very to himself. He wasn't anti-social, he always had friends, and everybody liked him - but he could go off and entertain himself for hours, he didn't seem to need toys or friends. He could be alone without being lonely. The secrets our parents kept, though unknown to Chris and I, led to bouts of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced to witness since we were very young. It seemed like they never fought without us. I remember the first family meeting to let Chris and me in on their plans for getting a divorce. They wanted us to choose which of them we'd live with. I cried my eyes out. But the divorce never happened, though the threats and meetings never stopped. It wasn't long before Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce. Chris and I just wanted to get away from their fights and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their company made enough money. Dad had been the young genius [that] NASA enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the American satellite radar systems that would be our answer to the Russian Sputnik. And mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her get-up- and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge. By the time the company actually made its first million, the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the promise she'd made us. (MORE)

Yet with what lipstick remains, he writes on the mirror:

159) 24) text: You can see the Salton Sea from up there? CHRIS
159) 27) text: My goodness. CHRIS
159) 31) text: Chris smiles and follows Ron.       As they approach the bottom of the hill -
159) 33) text: Chris thinks about it.     Then -
159) 34) dialog: Yeah, sure. It'll take me a couple of minutes to clean up.
161) 0) text: We see Ron and Chris driving parallel on the windmilled road (Our frame will only hold the lower fraction of the spinning windmills in the background)
163) 0) text: MUSIC OVER: As Chris and Ron ride the tram to the peak, we watch Chris watching Ron, his kind, moist old eyes, slowly blinking at the wonder of the nature around him. Other passengers on the tram seem nervous, but Ron is meditative, almost hypnotized.
164) 0) text: The two of them sit in a quiet, corner   booth of the tramway eatery that sits on the summit   of San Jacinto overlooking the lights of Palm Springs   and the desert clear back to Salton Sea. Chris is on    a roll.
164) 1) dialog: How old are you, Mr. Franz?
164) 3) dialog: Seventy-nine...see, all due respect, but the real difference between people is the quality of their soul and not on how long they've trudged around like a dip-shit. Ron laughs.
164) 4) dialog: But it's true.
164) 6) dialog: The government's the same as my parents. They don't respect anybody. Regulation. Regulation. Regulation. WE can't do this. But THEY can do that. I mean, the hypocrisy of the whole...culture.   Makes me crazy. My father was having children                * with two women at the same time, and then              * has the gall to think that he can be of some guidance to me? Make judgments on me? My mother, of course, goes along with all of it. Keeps the secret, which of course, makes my whole life a fiction. Everything I thought was, wasn't. They're such fools! Fucking idiots!
164) 9) dialog: (realizing his slip)
164) 10) text: Sorry. I don't usually use that kind of language either. I just get so angry thinking about it. Ron reaches across the table.    Puts his sturdy hand on Chris' shoulder.
165) 0) text: As Ron and Chris pull up in the pick-up truck, we see SPORADIC FIREWORKS WHISTLING AND CRACKLING into the air above the hot-springs, and HEAR the distant HOOTING of its inhabitants. Chris hops out and walks around to Ron's side of the truck.
165) 1) dialog: Awww, that was a great time Mr. Franz. Thank you.
165) 3) dialog: That would be swell. Ron is thrilled.
165) 5) dialog: Good night Mr. Franz.

167) 0) text: Chris summiting the rock formation. He looks down over the desert and there before him, The Salton Sea.
168) 0) text: The house is a single-level, beige structure, sitting between the Salton Sea and a small inlet where he keeps a fishing boat. Underneath a canopy in the backyard, there is a small workshop of some kind. HIGH ANGLE: Chris, looking at his own reflection in the water below Ron's dock. In the reflection, we see his hands full of dirty laundry.
169) 0) text: Ron broils a couple of steaks. Chris enters and moves past Ron carrying his laundry into another room.

171) 5) text: Well, that's what it's for.   How do these steaks look? Ron pops the steaks on the kitchen table. CHRIS
171) 8) text: What do you drink? CHRIS
171) 10) text: Nope. CHRIS
171) 12) text: Nope. Don't have any alcohol. I had to quit all that. How about a guava juice? CHRIS
171) 18) text: (brightening) You see all these kids over here? CHRIS
171) 22) text: (pridefully shows Chris the picture)
171) 23) text: And this is Akira. Just finished medical school. Chris takes the picture and studies Akira's face.   Ron sits back down.
171) 26) dialog: Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?
171) 28) dialog: (having wolfed down the steak)
172) 0) text: As we begin, Ron is instructing Chris in the skills of leather engraving.
173) 0) text: Chris, a clear plastic bag of clean laundry beside him, sits alone, cross-legged. He begins to carve into a leather belt.
174) 0) text: We follow Chris in a LOW ANGLE up his mountain run framing from mid-back to just above his head, sweating profusely.
176) 0) text: Chris reaching the summit.   He bends over to catch his breath, hands on knees.
176) 3) text: That thing's twice as salty as the ocean. Did you know that? Chris has barely the breath to speak.
176) 4) dialog: Anything alive in it? Ron shrugs his shoulders in a "who cares?" fashion. Chris laughs but nods in the affirmative and gives Ron the thumbs up.
178) 0) text: ALEX is inscribed at the belt's left end; then the initials C.J.M. (for Christopher Johnson McCandless) frame a skull and crossbones. Across the strip of cowhide one sees a rendering of two-lane blacktop, a No U turn sign, a thunderstorm producing a flash flood that engulfs a car, a hitchhiker's thumb, an eagle, the Sierra Nevada, salmon cavorting in the Pacific Ocean, the Pacific Coast Highway from Oregon to Washington, the Rocky Mountains, Montana wheat fields, a South Dakota rattlesnake, Westerberg's house in Carthage, the Colorado River rapids, a canoe beached beside a tent, Las Vegas, and at the buckle end, finally, the letter N.
178) 2) dialog: ...North.
179) 5) dialog: (yells down from above)
179) 8) dialog: I do, Mr. Franz. You've got to get back out in the world. Get out of that lonely house of yours, that little workshop, and go live on the road. Ron waves him off.
179) 9) dialog: Really. You're going to live a long time, Ron. You should make a radical change in your lifestyle. The core of man's spirit comes with new experiences. And there you are, stubborn old man, sitting on your butt.
179) 13) text: (mumbling) "Stubborn old man." Chris is laughing and clapping. CHRIS
179) 15) text: (mumbling) Ya little pinhead. Chris is jumping up and down, thrilled for Ron's efforts. Now the old man's shuffle has turned into an old man's walk. But he ain't stopping. And bit by bit he shows he's got it in him after all. As Ron is just about to mount the summit, Chris extends a hand. Ron swats it away. RON (CONT'D)
179) 17) dialog: You alright? Ron, after taking one more deep breath, sits up and Chris sits next to him. He's actually pretty happy with himself. He looks out and sees the distant Salton Sea. RON
179) 18) text: I'm going to miss you when you go. CHRIS
179) 24) text: I am. Chris buys it this time and feels he's accomplished something with Ron.
179) 26) dialog: Holy Shit!
180) 0) text: Chris pulls his laundry out of the dryer. He's got his pack sitting in the doorway to the kitchen. He folds his things and tucks them into his pack.
180) 3) text: Heard you get up off the couch half an hour ago, and had a funny feeling you might not be here for our breakfast. Chris says nothing. RON (CONT'D)
180) 4) text: I'm going to drive you a hundred miles to somewhere where you can pick up a train, a plane, or hitch a ride without getting stuck on this desert. I'd take you all the way to Alaska if I didn't have to get to an eight o'clock mass. CHRIS
180) 6) text: I want to do it.     Get you started on this thing of yours. CHRIS
180) 8) text: (interrupting) I know. On your "Great Alaskan Adventure." From just out of Chris' eye-line, Ron leans out of frame, picking up a zippered duffel bag. He opens it, displaying the contents to Chris. RON (CONT'D)
180) 9) text: There's a machete, an arctic parka, collapsible fishing pole, and a few odds and ends I threw in there for you. CHRIS
180) 11) text: Oh, just take it. Chris does, nodding his thanks.
183) 2) dialog: Yep. Both of them are uncomfortable. Chris goes for the door handle. Ron's gnarled hand reaches out to take Chris' elbow. After a long beat, Ron speaks without looking at Chris.
183) 4) dialog: How about we talk about this when I get back from Alaska, Ron. Would that be alright?
183) 6) dialog: Alright, Ron. We'll talk about it then.
183) 9) dialog: Thanks, Ron. Ron nods. Chris gets out of the truck. Ron watches as Chris saddles up his bag including the duffel that Ron gave him. Chris crosses the exit junction to where he can pick up a ride north on the far side of the road. We ZOOM SLOWLY through the windshield into Ron's face as he watches Chris hitching away. We HEAR the first bars of Neil Young's My My, Hey Hey. This will carry throughout the following MONTAGE.
184) 0) text: 1. We ZOOM into Walt McCandless' face as he looks through the Questar telescope that Chris had given him. ANGLE: The stars through the telescope. The same stars his son walks under...somewhere. We PAN ACROSS SPACE. (Note: This montage will intercut Chris' traveling POV with objective shots. However, we never SEE Chris.) 2. We PULL BACK from the starry night sky to see it framed from within a moving train. 3. Carine in her shower, water cascades over her face. 4. Billie in her kitchen, making dinner. 5. Through the windshield of a semi-truck, the sun rises on Glacier National Park. 6. A HANDHELD ZOOM-OUT from Canadian border crossing, CAMERA TURNS to the woods beyond and MOVES INTO THEM.
186) 0) text: Chris is holding a book from which he reads aloud the LAST LINE OF THE POEM...
186) 1) dialog: ...and I will tell about it.

190) 0) text: Its banks lined with a jagged shelf of frozen overflow. At its center, a channel of gently flowing water, opaque with glacial till. Beyond the far ice shelf, Chris appears from the riverside treeline. He eases across the ice, then wades through the latte-colored channel and on to the other side. REVERSE ANGLE: Chris moving toward the opposite tree line, he turns back to the gentle river behind. Chris' POV scanning the terrain. From the river to a distant mountain peak and then to a second mountain peak, triangulating his location. He makes a drawing on a pad of paper and piles some medium- sized rocks to mark the spot before moving on into the trees.
192) 0) text: Chris has skinned and is cooking a squirrel.
193) 0) text: Chris packs the last of his camp and begins his march upriver.
194) 0) text: As Chris walks upon a clearing in the tree line, he catches his first glimpse of Denali's (Mt. McKinley's) high-blinding white bulwarks. Chris stands in awe. We remain in his WIDE-SHOT POV as it -
195) 0) text: CAMERA ANGLED SKYWARD into the broken rays of grey light. We TILT DOWN to find (and TRACK through the trees with) Chris moving along the river, when he sees something just OFF CAMERA. Chris' POV: Through the trees and fireweed, he sees something metallic and rusty. Chris moves up through the underbrush and the snow into the narrow tree line and on into the clearing, where before him: A DERELICT SCHOOL BUS. It is a vintage International Harvester from the 1940's. Chris approaches the bus, lifts the hood a little bit seeing that the engine is gone. As he moves around the vehicle, we see several windows are cracked or missing altogether. The green and white paint is badly oxidized. Weathered lettering: Fairbanks City Transit System Bus 142.
196) 0) text: Broken whiskey bottles litter the floor. Chris may well have found his new home. The bus is outfitted with a bunk and a barrel stove. Previous visitors had left it stocked with matches, bug dope, and other essentials.
197) 0) text: We follow Chris back out of the bus, surveying the area of the clearing. He loves what he sees.
198) 5) dialog: ...the road. Escaped from Atlanta. Thou shalt not return `cause the "west is the best." And now after two rambling years, comes the final and greatest adventure. Chris is cleaning up the bus.
198) 6) dialog: The climactic battle to kill the false being within and victoriously conclude the spiritual revolution. Chris shoveling snow away from the bus entrance with a rock.
198) 8) dialog: Ten days and nights of freight trains and hitchhiking, bringing him to the great white north. Back to Chris, REAL TIME as he continues to write as he speaks:
198) 9) dialog: No longer to be poisoned by civilization, he flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild. Chris signs his doctrine -
199) 0) text: Chris posts a found piece of paper on the inner wall of the bus alongside his doctrine. CU: Chris' hand, he writes and circles the number: 1 - MAGIC BUS DAY.
200) 0) text: Chris comes out, rifle in hand. We TRACK with him as he moves into the woods on the hunt.
200) 1) text: Chris searching for game. He moves through the woods along the river and at the base of a nearby mountain. Finding animals for food seems more difficult than expected.
201) 0) text: Chris stumbles upon a caribou as it steps out from the woods. He lines up his rifle on the animal, about to pull the trigger, when its calf appears beside it.
202) 2) dialog: Shit!
203) 0) text: Chris, cooking rice. We see his single bag of rice.     I amount tells us the hunting had better improve soon. We explore a PASSAGE OF TIME throughout which CHRIS GETS INCREASINGLY THIN AND PALE: hunting, sleeping, cooking, rice dwindling, line-ups of scrawny shot birds. He adds holes to his belt leather to accommodate his shrinking waistline.
205) 0) text: Chris eats his measly catch but looks to his bag of rice with concern, perhaps only a day or so left of his rations. We come to the diary/log posted on the wall. We see that he has been there for a week's worth of entries as the squirrel is mentioned on day seven.

211) 0) text: Chris shoots a porcupine.
213) 0) text: Chris stands triumphant at the peak of a 3000 foot butte overlooking the bus. CIRCLE CAMERA around him 360 degrees recording the broad vista. ANGLE: CU - He's beaming with satisfaction. We begin a SLOW ZOOM OUT and then accelerate the ZOOM encompassing the entire grandeur of the mountain with Chris at its peak.

221) 0) text: Chris sits amongst the pink bunches of fireweed choking the vehicles wheel wells, growing higher than the axles, his back leaning against the bus, finishing the reading of Family Happiness. ANGLE: Chris, reading with great interest.   His POV: The page: what Chris reads: And then, on top of all that, you for a mate, and children, perhaps - what more can the heart of a man desire? ANGLE: Chris: He looks up from his book. A gentle breeze tickles morning flowers. The sunlight dances in a coppice of aspen and leaves of trees above. The sound of buzzing flies mutes. He is taking one last look at his paradise.
222) 0) text: Chris showers (PHOTO-SONIC) MUSIC, LYNYRD SKYNYRD'S Simple Man (lyrics in cursive) begins to play OVER:
223) 0) text: My momma told me / when I was young Chris packs his gear. Come sit beside me / my only son A last look about the bus.
225) 2) text: Just take your time / don't live too fast We pass the familiar landmark of the Mt. McKinley clearing where Chris had camped. Troubles w ill come / and they will pass Chris walking and camping his way back to the Teklanika River and the road home. Find a woman / you'll find love and don't forget son / there's someone up above...
226) 0) text: In the trees beside the river, we find Chris. The river is not yet in sight but Chris starts to HEAR it: A building rumble. As Chris exits the treeline, there she is: The Teklanika at full flood. Seventy-five foot wide banks, replacing the narrow ice canal of four months earlier. Snowmelt from glaciers high in the Alaska range, its opaque glacial sediment the color of wet concrete. And what had been a distant rumble in the woods, now had the volume and power of a freight train, a seventy-five foot wide one. Chris grabs a hold of a riverside branch and takes one slow, careful step into the river. Without mercy, WHAM! the river kicks his feet out from under him! The branch he holds SNAPS! By some miracle, his hands move like lightening and he grabs a lower, sturdier branch below, saving himself from a certain death.
227) 0) text: It's pouring rain outside.   The rain pelts the top of th bus. Chris' pack is thrown onto the bunk. His hand appears at the diary/log on the wall. He writes:
228) 0) text: EXTREME CU: Beaded and shimmering from the past night's rain, a bright red berry moves in the breeze like a tiny vibrating bell. RACK FOCUS to Chris' eyes spying it. He plucks it from its stem.

230) 3) dialog: 
230) 5) dialog: (echoing)
230) 6) text: By its right name. By its right name. He puts down the book and brings one of the ripe berries in front of his face (as close as shot of when he picked it.) Chris then grabs Tanaina Plantlore, the flora and fauna book he had gotten from the library in Fairbanks. And it takes him out of the bus like a divining rod. His nose in the book, he follows it.
231) 1) dialog: Beautiful blueberries - Vaccinium uliginosum. Eskimo potato - Hedysarum alpinum...etc. We follow Chris over a number of days as he eats from these identified species of plant, each being logged, one by one by name on the bus diary/log.
232) 0) text: With Tanaina Plantlore by his side, Chris digs into the soft earth on the berm of the river bank and digs up a wild potato root.
233) 0) text: Chris pulls the seeds from the root, noshing on them as he reads from Doctor Zhivago. We drift from him reading to the diary/log on the wall. The day representing: July 24th The diary/log: WILD POTATO ROOT We drift back to Chris. Fatigue shows in his eyes as he puts the book down and lays down to sleep.
235) 0) text: The open bag of seeds beside Chris' sleeping body. We drift over to Chris' face, his lips de-hydrated, and skin parched. He breathes heavily. He awakens. He tries to sit up. It's a terrible struggle. Barely makes it to his feet. Chris stumbles to the door of the bus, looking up at the hot sun. He has to sit back down on the small bus steps. From his position on the step, he leans back into the bus and is able to grab his water jug. He pours it into his mouth but nothing seems to satiate or hydrate him. He drinks it all. It spills over his face and chest.
236) 0) text: Chris kneels, holding one of the potato seeds to the sunlight and there we see them - the lateral veins that indicate poisonous seeds.
238) 0) text: Chris, barely able to walk, moves, at the pace of an elderly man, with his rifle, through the underbrush.    H needs food now.
239) 0) text: He shoots a squirrel. But as he moves toward what he thinks is his kill, the squirrel makes off with a bleeding tail. Chris fires several desperate shots at the squirrel but misses with each one.
240) 0) text: Chris, having a fitful sleep.   Short breaths and mutterings.
241) 0) text: A big moon shines above and we find on a tree branch, the squirrel Chris had clipped in the tail earlier in the day. On the last legs of bleeding to death, it falls from the tree. The moon becomes the sun and we pass a couple of days through visions of the nature about in varying light.
242) 0) text: Chris labors up the riverbank with his water jug full. He is shirtless and absolutely emaciated. Frightening. He pauses at the river's edge to take air into his lungs. It's all he can do just to breath. WIDE ANGLE TABLEAU (CONTINUOUS): Chris standing at the river's edge catching his breath framed against the background of the 3000 foot butte that he'd so recently climbed with ease.
243) 0) text: Chris lays on the floor. CU Chris: Orange light twinkles in his eyes. Chris' POV: through the bus window, we see the orange glow of smoke rising into the air. CU: Chris writes in his diary log.

244) 5) text: And that an unshared happiness is not happiness... Chris steals his pencil from within the pages of the book, scribbling across the page: CHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.) (CONT'D)
244) 10) text: (with a weak voice) Call everything by its right name. The drumbeat increases as he signs the note: CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS. We move from the page back up to Chris. We see that he has put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of his weakening sight. He removes them, folds them, and lays them by his side. His body begins to tremble. His eyes dance wildly. The drumming intensifies. Chris takes one last look out the window. The sun is covered by a well-defined and puffy cloud.
246) 0) text: Chris, approaching the Annandale house.    His backpack o and body healthy. Billie parts the curtains, ecstatic to see Chris approach, alive and healthy. We SEE but do not hear her call to Walt. A smiling Chris steps up the curb, approaching home. Walt and Billie - we PUSH INTO them as they gleefully run out the front door to their returning son. PUSH INTO Chris - he dispatches his backpack to the ground and runs toward his parents' embrace.
246) 1) dialog: What if you saw me running into your arms... Chris, Walt, and Billie on the cusp of a jubilant and loving embrace!
246) 2) dialog: Would you see then... The DRUMMING resumes with a BLAST OF BASS and before an embrace is possible...
246) 3) dialog: ...what I see now?
247) 3) text: He made it.   He lived.   He loved. Cat Stevens' Miles from Nowhere plays OVER: As we PULL AWAY from Chris' face through the bus window and up into the sky - We drift further and further away, above the stunted trees and the shimmering roof of the bus like a tiny white gleam in a wild green sea grows smaller and smaller. REPRISE IMAGE of truck driver taking picture of Chris in scene #1. Then it's him: The smiling STILL IMAGE we saw taken in the first scene from behind, but now we are seeing it from the front and it is the image of the real Christopher McCandless on the edge of the Stampede Trail. As it takes over the screen, we ZOOM SLOWLY into his smiling face. And then, these words appear superimposed over it: Dedicated to the memory of Christopher Johnson McCandless February 12, 1968 - August 18th, 1992 As those words dissolve, these words appear: On September 19, 1992, Carine McCandless flew with her brother's ashes from Alaska home to the eastern seaboard. She carried them with her on the plane...in her backpack.
