3) 8) dialog: The arrogant son of a bitch actually kept a record of all of his correspondence with the KGB, GRU, and SVR. Last drop was two months ago.
3) 10) dialog: Very much so. (they keep walking) Most of the datacard is still encrypted. First thing we cracked was a ledger tracing payments-received: six-hundred thousand in cash so far, with another eight hundred thousand waiting for him in an escrow account in Moscow. 82. Just then, Eric stops - at a LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM. It's PACKED. 60 AGENTS now, grinding away.
3) 12) dialog: We're starting air surveillance, picket surveillance, monitoring his phones and computers. We'll also be buying the house across the street from him and putting two agents there. (soberly: ) As long as he's active, every single source we're working has to be considered at risk: Counter-Intel and Counter-Terrorism. He knows all their names and locations. (Eric nods) Okay. Tomorrow. You'll drive him in a Bureau vehicle. Make sure you keep him out of the office for at least three hours. We're sweeping his car.
3) 14) dialog: Need to get some hard evidence on him. Thanks for--

27) 0) text: A hand raps hard on an apartment door, repeatedly. Then t door is opened by Kate. Eric stands in her doorway, too wound-up to say hello:
27) 2) dialog: I'm assuming that you know what a massive fuck-up that would be.
27) 4) dialog: Uh-huh.
27) 6) dialog: Wanna make things easier? Next time Hanssen gives you a package and tells you to mail it, mail it! That made his jaw drop. Utter silence. She eyes him...
27) 8) dialog: That was a Bureau vehicle you were in today, Hot-Shot. It had ears.
27) 11) dialog: The package has been re-sealed as you found it, right? No trace that it was ever opened, nothing that would arouse any suspicions on the other end? 100.
27) 13) dialog: We'll see. There's nothing to say. He's beyond embarrassed now.
27) 14) dialog: I understand that you're stressed, Eric. Cover-cases are like that. But Agents learn to withstand it; that's what makes them agents. Okay?
27) 16) dialog: Just so happens, we don't think you'll have to withstand it much longer, maybe just days. Wait. That almost sounded encouraging. Eric pauses...
27) 18) dialog: We pulled 300 pages of classified materials out of a Lawn & Leaf Bag in his trunk today. His next drop appears to be imminent. Then he's ours. From despair to hope, just like that...
27) 20) dialog: Oh. (a beat) I'm sorry you're having problems at home. I'd offer you some advice but it wouldn't be worth much - I don't even have a cat. Best I can tell you is keep your head on and do your job; it's your best shot at getting this over with. Understand?
27) 23) dialog: It's fine. I'm supposed to be the one you bring problems to. He heads for the door. She escorts him, opens it. But he turns, just before leaving:
27) 25) dialog: Sure.
27) 27) dialog: Ask me when we've caught him. In the distance a few chords from a PIANO can be heard, t source unseen. The music carries us into: EXT. FOXSTONE PARK — DAY 169 Hanssen drives his car at 5 m.p.h., creeping past the entrance to Foxstone Park. He stares out the side window, looking for something... INTERCUT WITH:

36) 20) dialog: "Since communicating last, and one wonders if because of it, I have been promoted to a higher do-nothing Senior Executive job, outside of regular access to information within the counterintelligence program." Hanssen dips his finger in the water, crosses himself, as VOICE begins to over-ride Kate's, also in V.0O.:
