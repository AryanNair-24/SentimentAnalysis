49) 18) dialog: Ya know something, Boss? You do test people too much, and I've had it! Who the hell d'you think was calling me? My handlers in the Kremlin? Once and for all, for the record: I don't have any. I'm not a foreign agent! Is that official enough? ‘Cause I'm getting really tired of having to prove myself to you every five minutes.

49) 21) dialog: The call was from Juliana, obviously. My wife. She's trying to reach me because I told her I'd be home by now and because we're in another fight, caused by you as usual. Thanks for dropping by unannounced and lecturing her about Opus Dei, that was real helpful. And thanks for staring at her in church like she was from Mars. That also worked out great. Lemme guess, you were testing her too. Ya know she asked me this morning why you're like this, why you grind everybody so hard. And I had all these answers ready: "He's misunderstood." "He's trying to fix the Bureau and no one'll listen." "He was born in the wrong century." "His father was a prick." I've got a whole list. But ya know something? At the end of the day it's all crap. You are who you are and you do what you do. The why doesn't mean a fucking thing. Does it? Hanssen considers that, his face a blank... +..then he turns without a word, and starts a slow, drunk walk back toward the car. Conversation over.
