Some personnel are on duty in the hospita during this lunch period, but beside Dish, two of the  following three nurses with whom we will become acquainte are present here: KNOCKO, who is black, a captain in her thirties, solidly  built, very strong and very competent in her job; LESLIE, also a captain, not more than thirty, bright, attractive, cheerful, the kind of girl that brings out the latent mal matrimonial instinct but who, strangely, is treated as  inviolate by the by the sex-starved men of the post; and  LIEUTENANT SCORCH, who can't match Dish or Leslie by phys standards but has the asset of instant availability.

There is also curiosity about the newcomers from the unli men's section, where we see among others RADAR; VOLLMER,  Henry's overweight Sargeant Major; CORPORAL JUDSON, young black and fresh from Mississippi; PRIVATE BOONE, who look too young and nervous to be in any man's army; and PFC  SEIDMAN, whose first trip out of New York has taken him  halfway around the world. Henry, who alone has reason to be personally affronted by Duke and Hawkeye's unmilitary behavior, gets up and cross to where they are sitting.

1) 57) text: Hawkeye and the Australian throw in their hands.
1) 61) dialog: (to the general) I'm going to play poker until three  a.m. or until the patient is ready  for surgery. However, if you'd like  to operate on him yourself right  now, be my guest. I get the same  dough whether I work or not.
1) 63) dialog: There's nothing to talk about,  General. You take the case yourself  or join me at three o'clock. Either  way you're liable to learn something.
1) 64) text: The General is far from pleased with the disrespect accor him, but as the poker players start a new hand, he decide against making an issue on terms selected by Hawkeye. Ins he turns around and goes out.
1) 67) dialog: (to Seidman) Please ask General Hammond to join  us.
1) 69) dialog: General, at one-thirty when I checked  him last, this guy had had less than  a pint of blood, and he'd lost two  or three. His pulse then was 120 and  his blood pressure was about 90.  Now, at three o'clock, he's had three  pints of blood. His pulse is 80 and  his pressure 120. His collapsed lung  has been expanded and he's had a  gram of terramycin intravenously. We  can operate on him safely and we  should do it quickly, but we don't  have to do it frantically or  carelessly.
1) 71) dialog: Now, General, I'm going to sandbag  you. Do you think we're ready to get  out of this belly?
1) 73) dialog: Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes  in the large bowel. They've all been  in the small bowel, but the smell is  different. I caught a whiff of large  bowel, but it ain't staring us in  the face, right?
1) 75) dialog: So if it ain't staring us in the  face, it's got to be retroperitoneal.  And that, along with the look of the  wounds, makes me figure he's got a  hole in his sigmoid colon that we  won't find unless we look for it.
1) 77) dialog: And there it is.
1) 79) dialog: Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll  tell you what makes him the best  C.O. you've got in any of your  hospitals. He leaves all the medical  decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what  meatball surgery is.
1) 83) dialog: She's so square she's even against  our having a football team.
1) 89) dialog: Well, it's still pretty much in the  talk stage.
1) 91) dialog: I think I heard about that.
1) 93) dialog: Must be fun. But the point we want  to make about Henry...
1) 95) text: After the General has left, the other two Swampmen look a Hawkeye uncomprehendingly.
1) 97) dialog: All three of us played for our  schools. And there are at least four  other guys...
1) 99) dialog: We can balance that by getting  ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say  he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a  specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon  Jones.
1) 101) dialog: Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker'  Jones.
1) 104) dialog: On account he got caught in the doctor  draft. He was a surgical resident  playing semi-pro ball weekends when  the Eagles signed him.
1) 106) dialog: I worked with Spearchucker my first  month over here, at the 72nd Evac in  Taegu. Most of the colored guys know  who he is but they're not talking  because he asked them not to.
1) 108) dialog: We'll cut him in on the bets we make.  And still have enough profit to send  Ho-Jon to college.
1) 110) dialog: He can move in here with us.
1) 112) dialog: Don't tell me about your problems,  boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
1) 128) text: Hawkeye catches a pass from Trapper and runs with the bal right to where Henry and Spearchucker are standing.
1) 129) dialog: Listen, we look pretty lousy out  there, right?
1) 131) dialog: I'm thinking about how we can make  more money. (to Henry) Suppose we bet only part of our dough  and keep this big animal out of the  game the whole first half and let  them roll up some points. Then you  could bet the rest of our bundle  between the halves and get the General  and his friends to give us some real  odds.
1) 133) dialog: It's the only way we can make enough  to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
1) 137) dialog: The bastards outconned us.
1) 139) dialog: If you start the game instead of  waiting, you mean?
1) 143) dialog: But we'd have to break his leg or  something to keep him out of the  game for good.
1) 148) dialog: I don't think I could hurt one of  them with a sledgehammer.
1) 151) dialog: The pro halback is playing safety.  Kick it to anybody else.
1) 157) text: He throws a lateral pass to Hawkeye, toward whom both tac from Cleveland now run. Hawkeye leads them almost from on side of the field to the other, then reverses direction,  keeping them on the move till he sees a chance to throw a lateral to Trapper.
1) 161) text: They are near the sideline to their left, playing a winge formation. Trapper takes the ball from Vollmer, the cente runs back as if to pass but really gives it to Hawkeye at left half as Hawkeye goes by him in a wide sweep that tak him all the way to the right sideline with the two Clevel tackles in pursuit. Hawkeye then cuts in quick and tries to get by them but o of them brings him down for a gain of no more than two ya On the next play Trapper really goes back to pass, but hi blockers are of no use against the pro tackles, whom he s descending on him. Trapper starts running straight back f a while, then makes a dash to the right followed by a das to the left. He is almost tackled again, and his only rou of escape is back toward his own goal line.
1) 163) text: Faced with a loss of about twenty-five yards, Trapper spo Hawkeye in the area of the line of scrimmage and whips th ball to him. Hawkeye catches it but there are tacklers all around him he goes down almost immediately for no gain on the play.  Moving faster than they have to in order not to give the  opposition any rest, the team huddles.
1) 166) dialog: Don't try to get it far down. Kick  it up high so we can get there and  surround that son-ofa-bitch.
1) 168) text: He does a good job of it. The kick is high enough so ther are several red jerseys around the Ram halfback when he g under it. He raises his right arm for a fair catch. The would-be Ma tacklers, including Hawkeye and Trapper are frustrated. T array themselves defensively while their opponents have a huddle and line up to take the offense.
1) 169) dialog: (to Duke and Trapper) Let's get him this time. I don't  think they've got anyone else who  can carry the ball.
1) 170) text: As Hawkeye anticipated, the opposing quarterback slips th ball to the Ram halfback, who starts to go wide of the ta sees Hawkeye, untouched by blockers, closing in from the  outside, and makes his beautiful cross-over to cut back i At the same time he is hit at the knees by Hawkeye, and h by Duke. And there are quite a few other Mash players in immediate vicinity, Trapper and Ugly John in the forefron so that a lot of weight is piled up on top of the flashy  halfback. A close look at Ugly John reveals him to be reaching insi his jersey and under a shoulder pad, from which he extrac a hypodermic needle. With the skill of an expert  anesthesiologist he pulls up the sleeve of the tackled an stunned halfback, and plunges the needle into his arm. The Referee meanwhile is indignantly pulling at the Mash  players on top of the pile and orally expressing his  disapproval.
1) 187) dialog: (to Spearchucker) What's the matter?
1) 195) dialog: (getting an idea) Radar!
1) 208) text: They break out of the huddle and line up as directed, wit all the linemen except Hawkeye on Vollmer's right. Their  opponents have trouble adjusting to this and are even mor confused when, just as Trapper bends down to take the bal from Vollmer, Hawkeye steps back into the backfield and D squeezes into the already crowded right line. Returning t ball to Vollmer, Trapper turns his back, fakes a pitchout Spearchucker, who is racing toward the line, and continue backward, holding himself as if he still had the ball and were fading for a long pass. So successfully does he crea this impression that the two tackles from Cleveland, seei clearly that Spearchucker hasn't received the ball, desce on Trapper with their last burst of energy. Two other ora and-black linemen also fall on top of him. Meanwhile, Vol holding his arms crossed under his stomach to further hid the ball, and looking as if her were suffering from a pai blow beneath the belt, starts walking down the field at a angle toward his own sideline, making the opposition thin he is heading for the bench to seek relief from his injur Spearchucker stops running at about the enemy thirty, loo back to where Trapper's tacklers are beginning to remove  themselves, but also notes out of the corner of his eye t only the opposing safety man is anywhere near Vollmer and that he isn't paying much attention to him. From the bench a frantic Henry looks indignantly at the s of his center and Sergeant Major coming off the field.

1) 310) dialog: Nothing to it. You just turn a chair  around backwards and rest your chin  on the top. You sit there with a big  cigar in your mouth and and every  now and then, just to show you're  looking, you say, 'Don't wave it so  close to my cigar, soldier.' That's  all you do. You can't go wrong.
1) 313) dialog: Never mind your captain, honey. (takes bottle from  Duke and puts it  away) I'll take care of mine. Till we land  in Chicago.
