Some personnel are on duty in the hospita during this lunch period, but beside Dish, two of the  following three nurses with whom we will become acquainte are present here: KNOCKO, who is black, a captain in her thirties, solidly  built, very strong and very competent in her job; LESLIE, also a captain, not more than thirty, bright, attractive, cheerful, the kind of girl that brings out the latent mal matrimonial instinct but who, strangely, is treated as  inviolate by the by the sex-starved men of the post; and  LIEUTENANT SCORCH, who can't match Dish or Leslie by phys standards but has the asset of instant availability. A Korean boy, not yet of military age, in green fatigue p and an off-white coat, appears promptly and heaps Duke an Hawkeye's plates with food. Duke is hungry enough to turn his whole attention to the meal, but Hawkeye is unable to keep his eyes off Lieutenant Dish while eating. Thus neit of them is aware of the attention they are getting from t male officers' group, which includes HENRY, a couple of  medical captains named MURRHARDT and BANDINI; DAGO RED  (officially, Father John Patrick Mulcahy, red-haired Cath Chaplain of the area) and the PAINLESS POLE (Captain Walt Zaldowski, Dental Officer), both in their thirties; and  CAPTAIN UGLY JOHN BLACK, an Australian anesthesiologist. There is also curiosity about the newcomers from the unli men's section, where we see among others RADAR; VOLLMER,  Henry's overweight Sargeant Major; CORPORAL JUDSON, young black and fresh from Mississippi; PRIVATE BOONE, who look too young and nervous to be in any man's army; and PFC  SEIDMAN, whose first trip out of New York has taken him  halfway around the world. Henry, who alone has reason to be personally affronted by Duke and Hawkeye's unmilitary behavior, gets up and cross to where they are sitting.
