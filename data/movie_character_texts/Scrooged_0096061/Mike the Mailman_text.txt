The howling continues as WE PAN DOWN to a MAN in a dog suit, on all fours, howling at a cartoonish MIKE THE MAILMAN who wears an exaggerated, corny mailman suit, bow tie and carries an over-size mail pouch. WE ARE WATCHING a children's TV show in progress, The dog chews Mike's pant-leg, growling in front of a whimsical dog house hand-lettered -- "KIDDIE KENNEL".
