A table is ringed with network EXECUTIVES. At. one end of the table is the big TV monitor. At the other end sits FRANK CROSS, president of IBC, who presides over the meeting. Frank is trim, polished and good-looking. At thirty-eight, he is young for the powerful position he holds. The press still calls him a "TV wonderkind." Co-workers call him the "Smiling Viper." MRS. GRACE COOLEY, his attractive black secretary, sits near him taking notes. This is a power office -- bleak, modern and immense. It is on the 22nd floor with huge grid windows that look down on New York City. It's designed to impress and intimidate. There is futuristic design furniture, a wall of TV monitors, a private bathroom, a small kitchen, a bar. Above the ultra~modern desk hangs a Picasso from his 1907-8 “African-Negro" period. The walls are decorated with primitive masks, the closest thing Frank has to a hobby. The massive desk is littered with Scrooge miscellany -- drawings, models, posters, swatches, etc. No one speaks, waiting for Frank's reaction. There are a few nervous coughs. Finally Frank leans forward in the chair.
