14) 0) text: SENECA CRANE, a dark genius, looks over his domain. This is Mission Control, (seen from the windows surroundi Haymitch's quarters last year.) It's NASA on steroids: hu screens, data, massive electronic coverage. On an ILLUMINATED BOARD we see 24 EMPTY SLOTS, two for ev District. Names will go here; two from District 12... Sen eyes it, then spots something that irritates him greatly: An assistant, BETTO, is virtually drawing on a monitor (i a hobby) - unaware that Seneca is in the vicinity... unti Seneca leans in and angrily deletes Betto's screen. Uh-oh

21) 16) dialog: I miss supper? Tense silence. He takes a seat, sets his drink down, unfo his napkin - reflexively reaching for a bottle of white G ..-but Peeta, just as reflexively, grabs Haymitch's hand. shocks the hell out of everyone - mostly Peeta himself.
21) 18) dialog: Here's some advice. Don't die. He bursts out laughing. Katniss looks to Peeta.
21) 21) dialog: Well. Did I actually get a pair of fighters this year? Katniss and Peeta weren't expecting that. Haymitch eyes h
21) 22) dialog: Can you hit anything with that knife besides a table? Katniss yanks the knife from the table and throws it at t far wall. It sticks between two panel-seams. Haymitch ris circles his two Tributes, studying them.
21) 23) dialog: I'll make a deal with you two. You don't interfere with my drinking, and I'll stay sober enough to help you. Is that fair? (they nod) You'll have to do exactly as I say. About everything. Effie puts some ice in a napkin, hands it to Peeta for th BRUISE reddening his jaw.
21) 24) dialog: No. Let it bruise. People will think you've been mixing it up with the other Tributes before you've even entered the Arena. (Peeta sets it down) When we get to the Capitol, you'll be put in the hands of stylists who'll prepare you for your presentation. Their work is vital.
21) 26) dialog: Yes. It is. And the people who figure that out tend to be the ones who survive. Are you through now? That shut Katniss up. Haymitch looks right through her.
21) 27) dialog: The best-looking tributes get the Most sponsors. And sponsors are my only means of helping you once you're in The Arena. Understood? .--which is when Katniss sees something out the window - landmark, recognizeable to us... It's Chicago. Or what used to be Chicago. Across Lake Michigan we see t skeleton of a city. Decayed, lifeless. An empty ghost tow Haymitch approaches the wall, eyes the knife Katniss thre

24) 0) text: Haymitch and Effie lead the two junior celebrities throug the station. Feels like another planet to Katniss. They pass a VIRTUAL NEWSSTAND. One face appears on DOZENS I-MAGAZINE COVERS: "Seneca Crane - the genius behind the Hunger Games." Something tells Katniss to study this face A GIRL passes by, Katniss's age... with two healthy paren clean hair, a poodle on a leash... and an ice cream cone her hand. Licking happily.
25) 3) text: EFFIE (cont'd) (Katniss eyes her) No one's going to sponsor you looking like this, Katniss. Could you blame them? A look from Haymitch tells Katniss not to fire back.

32) 13) dialog: That should come in handy - if you ever need to frost someone to death. Katniss eyes Haymitch, Thanks for chiming in. Then:
32) 15) dialog: @ Congratulations. No wrestling during * " training. Confine yourselves to knot- * tying or something. Two CUSTODIANS pass by, pushing carts. Again, something o about them - a dullness in their eyes...
32) 18) dialog: My Goodness, what a rube. (Katniss tightens) Avoxes are criminals of the State, traitors. They work - and they don't bitch - mostly because their tongues've been cut out. That sickened Katniss. She suddenly takes a second look a @ TOWEL-BOY she'd just walked past, his eyes lifeless. 38.
32) 20) dialog: I wonder if you might become less * sullen at some point. * No reply. An ELEVATOR OPENS. They enter.
33) 0) text: Haymitch presses "12." The car starts to rise, quickly.
33) 2) dialog: You should listen to Effie, Darling; you need to be liked this week. If the people like you, you'll get more Sponsors, and Sponsors pay for the Gifts that might just keep you alive once you're inside The Arena - assuming I like you enough to send them and Seneca likes you enough to let me. So a little less... disdain would make sense here. Wouldn't it? Katniss pauses. Haymitch, Effie, and Peeta studying her..

They file in now... 42. ++.as the Gamesmakers chat by a buffet. We find Haymitch, sampling the DRINK CART... until he sighs, and turns: Betto is right behind Haymitch - ready to emasculate:
35) 2) dialog: You two will be evaluated last. The Gamesmakers are usually tired by then - you'll just have to get their attention somehow. Should be a good fit for you, Katniss, ‘cause it's the only pre-Games event that won't require you to be pleasant. Katniss notes the other Tributes: Cato, Clove, Marvel, Glimmer, Bravura... scoping the room out, undaunted.
35) 4) dialog: Absolutely. Your very best. Get a good score, and Sponsors will notice. Good luck! And may the odds be--
38) 3) dialog: Smart, Katniss. Real smart.
38) 5) dialog: No. But they might do something to your mother. Or to Prim. 45. That stopped Katniss flat...
38) 6) dialog: The Capitol doesn't appreciate dissent. Haven't you noticed? Just then she realizes... that Seneca has been watching f one floor up. Dread rockets through her now. She runs out
43) 2) dialog: Remember, you're still a happy pair - so act like it. Peeta nods. Katniss too, sort of. Haymitch pushes them ou ..-onto the Stage, where APPLAUSE echoes, CAMERAS everywh In the Balconies are the Gamesmakers. Katniss braces hers all too aware that all of Panem is watching:
47) 3) dialog: What happened?!
47) 6) dialog: I wish I had. It played great. That angered her even more. Peeta stays silent.
47) 9) dialog: e It means he just gave everybody outside District Twelve a reason to give a damn about you.
47) 11) dialog: He made you look desirable, which might be enough to save your life tomorrow. The Star-Crossed Lovers from District 12. Sponsors go for--
47) 13) dialog: Then fake it. Because whatever those people want to buy, it's our job to sell it to them. Understand? (a beat) Or would you rather do it your way - and die? e Katniss eyes them both... then walks away. We DISSOLVE

49) 3) dialog: Basically. Mostly. Had to honor my pledge to our Tributes. (no reply) Besides, tonight is not about booze. It's about bread and circuses.

One electronic wall is dedicated solely to the Hunger Gam There are "proposition bets" here - odds on which Tribute will die first, what the first cause of death will be, an “over-under" on how many Tributes will fall on the first And, of course, there are odds on who's going to win. At the top are the favorites. Cato at 3-to-1l. Marvel at 2. Thresh at 4-to-1. Peeta's way down, at 25-to-1.

There, listed at 100-to-1... is Katniss Everdeen. * Haymitch tightens. She's going to die, and he knows it.

52) 1) dialog: When the gong sounds, get the hell out of there. The Cornucopia is always a blood-bath, and you're not up to it. Just clear out, put as much distance as you can between yourself and the others, and find a source of water. I'm not gonna send you anything you can find on your own. Katniss nods. He's about to go on, when: A_MOUNTED TV _pops_on, "Reminding all Tributes to wake up gather in the Lobby of the Training Center!" Haymitch eyes it anxiously. Katniss too... until:
52) 2) dialog: Remember this - it's important: You don't win in there by killing * e people - despite what Seneca thinks. You win by not dying. (MORE)

97) 3) dialog: It's Treason - sneaking into the Capitol. Punishable by Death. Don't you know that? Gale nods. Haymitch eyes him with drunken awe.
97) 4) dialog: And you risked it? For her? My, my. (no reply...) Two boys in love with her. I wish I'd known. It would've played great during the interviews.
97) 6) dialog: Kid, she's not likely to survive long enough for that burn to be the thing that kills her.
97) 9) dialog: If the Gamesmakers approve it. If Seneca approves it.
97) 11) dialog: I just did. He said no. And asking again would be viewed as an act of dissent. Gale reacts - awe and disgust. Haymitch reads his mind:
97) 12) dialog: Yes, I'm a coward. And a drunk. I doubt you'd do any better on your twenty-fourth Games. He gulps down the rest of his drink. Signals for another. it's over. But Gale won't let up:
99) 0) text: Haymitch and Gale just saw that.
108) 2) dialog: Let me help her, Seneca. That leg is getting worse. (Seneca's silent) People like her. She's good theatre.
108) 6) dialog: If you're gonna put on a circus, at least make it a good one... That lands. The doors close. Irritated, Seneca moves to a desk, hits a button - messaging the Games Center below. Betto looks up. No one else can hear them: *
