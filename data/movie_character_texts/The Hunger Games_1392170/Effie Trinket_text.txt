Then Day One of the Games she hatcheted six kids in two minutes! And won! Sign, Dear. It's late. Effie hands her a pen and the papers. Katniss glances at them, then at Peeta. He nods. She takes the pen... ... when she's brushed aside, rudely, by Cato - as he and other Careers (Districts 1, 2, and 4), blow out of here. She watches Cato go, then signs the papers...
