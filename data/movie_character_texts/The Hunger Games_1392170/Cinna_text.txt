26) 12) dialog: Your braid - who did it?
26) 14) dialog: It's beautiful. Classic. We're not going to touch it. He enters, hits a button. The top of a table splits in tw and ANOTHER HUGE MEAL appears; Katniss won't react to it.
26) 15) dialog: I'm Cinna, Katniss. I'll be your @ stylist - which means I'm here to help you survive. Are you hungry?
26) 19) dialog: I know. He smiles warmly. That fast, a trust begins to grow.
26) 21) dialog: They lack imagination. Katniss, I asked for District 12. I wanted the challenge, and not because I like those stupid coal-miner outfits the Tributes from Twelve always get presented in. Right? He might just be sincere. Human. He seems it. They sit.

Up ahead, ANOTHER CHARIOT vanishes around a corner into t BRIGHT-LIGHTS of a street outside. But our Chariot hasn't been sent out yet. Cinna grins, excited.
27) 1) dialog: It's not real fire, of course. Just some synthetic flames Portia and I came up with. I want them to remember you. Be right back.

27) 9) dialog: It works! Thrilled, he makes a SSSSST sound at the HORSES up front. They begin to trot - and we're moving. +--all of it before Katniss can adjust to the fact that h cape is now burning. Cinna calls out to them:
27) 10) dialog: Heads high! Smiles! They're going to love you! Oh, and hold hands! +..as we're pulled through MASSIVE OPEN DOORS and onto:
41) 2) dialog: Thank you, Effie. Katniss, you can open your eyes now. Katniss's eyes open now... and she is stunned: ...by HER OWN REFLECTION: arms stenciled, hair woven in a lovely braid down one shoulder, make-up subtle and elegan And a jeweled DRESS, accented with tongues of fire. Not pretty. Not beautiful. Radiant as the sun.
41) 4) dialog: Give us a moment, all right? His team EXITS. Effie shrugs unhappily, follows them. Now it's just Cinna and Katniss. She still hasn't spoken.

41) 15) dialog: Well, when you-see me sitting in that audience, pretend I'm him. Can you do that? (she nods) Listen, I lied to you the other day - about the reason I asked for District 12. It was you, Katniss. What you did for your sister, how brave you were. Tonight requires... a different kind of bravery, okay? (that registered) Let them love you out there. It might just save you.
