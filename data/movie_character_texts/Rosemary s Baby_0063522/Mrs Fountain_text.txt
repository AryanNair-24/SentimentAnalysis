The apartment is empty, except for a few pieces of furniture in the den, from Mrs. Gardenia's son. The rooms are dark and full of shadows. Faint blue light comes through the win- dows. Guy turns into the living room, Rosemary to the bedroom; there are many packages spread on the floor (results of the shopping) and a solitary vanity. Rosemary kneels, opens a wooden crate, and pulls out three plates from the shavings. Guy comes in; she hands him the plates and starts putting back the shavings. We hear a woman's voice from behind the wall. MRS. CASTEVET (0.s.) Roman? Bring me in some root beer when you come! Guy and Rosemary look at each other. : Guy I didn't know they were still making Ma and Pa Kettle movies. He goes back to the living room. Rosemary follows him. On her way, she stops and looks toward the closet at the end of the hallway. She goes to it and opens it slowly. She takes out one of the four boards leaning against the side, turns it and looks at it. Guy has plugged the lamp in the living room and a light comes through the archway.
