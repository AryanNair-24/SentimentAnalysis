Nurselike she supports her husband's forearm. He is dazzling, in an every-colour seersucker jacket, red slacks, a pink bow tie, and a grey fedora with a pink band, He is seventy= five or older; she is sixty-eight or nine. They come closer with expressions of young alertness, with friend- ly quizzical smiles, The 2nd Policeman steps forward to meet them and their smiles falter and fall away.

Within is darkness; a@ second closet with a wire hanger glinting on the floor, and one bright spot of light, a keyhole. Pushing the panel all the way open, Rosemary steps into the second closet and ducks down, Through the keyhole, Rosemary sees at a distance a | small curic cabinet that stands at a job in the hall-= way of Mr, and Mrs, Castevet's apartment. Rosemary tries the door, It opens, She cleses it and backs out through her own closet and goes to the kitchen. From her knifesrack, Rosemary takes the longest sharpest carving knife. As she is leaving the kit= chen, we hear a key working in the lock of the front door. Rosemary rushes intc the nursery, brushing against the new bassinet, and presses herself against the wall, ‘Guy enters and goes into the kitchen, opens the fridge and takes out ice cubes.
