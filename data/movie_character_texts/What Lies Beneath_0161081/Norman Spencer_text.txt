The water finally rises above Claire's nostrils. Claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain yank it free.  The water slowly descends. When it seems that her lungs must burst, her mouth finall clears the descending water.  She chokes in great gulps o air. The drug is finally wearing off.  Claire sits up.  Norman unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway.  She turns off the water and stands unsteadily. She looks around for the phone and finally spots the litt antenna protruding from under Norman.  She delicately pul the phone out of his back pocket, only to discover that i been broken by his fall.  She drops it and walks quietly of the room.

She hears the hissing of the smashed radiator, then sees Norman, a shattered bloody mess on th floor of the cab. She leans over to see if he's dead, hears a squeak and realizes that the pickup, with the BATTERED SAILBOAT AND TRAILER miraculously still attached, is rolling deeper in the water. Before she can get the door open, the truck is half submerged.  She frantically manages to lower her window halfway and starts to pull herself out.

Claire tries to swim free, but Norman's not letting go. Suddenly metal snaps and the truck pops free of the trail It hurtles downwards and the still-glowing headlights reveal...
