29) 6) dialog: Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
29) 18) dialog: My lord, I'm not sure that... Charles takes his coat and puts it around Aulon's shoulders.

Tremoille looks anxious.  Charles glances at them, their expectant eyes awaiting his verdict.  He leads Jeanne across to Aulon.
39) 2) dialog: Yes, my lord.
40) 0) text: Jeanne blows the dust from a wooden crucifix, then replaces it above a bed.  Jean d'Aulon has brought her to a small room in one of the castle's turrets:  clean, plainly furnished, but hardly hospitable.  Jeanne inspect the room while Aulon stands by the door.
40) 1) dialog: Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
40) 3) dialog: Yes, of course... water... anything else? Two page boys run into the room, carrying luggage, water, washing bowl and some food.  They are LOUIS and RAYMOND, both 13, as inseparable as they are loyal.  Jeanne looks up, then sits on the bed, testing the horsehair mattress.
40) 5) dialog: Louis... water and fresh straw! Louis goes running off.
40) 7) dialog: Now?
40) 9) dialog: Right. (to Raymond)
40) 12) dialog: Now?
40) 14) dialog: Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do. He's about to leave when Jeanne adds --
40) 16) dialog: This I can do. (Jeanne looks surprised)
40) 19) dialog: Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
45) 0) text: A dark, musty council room, where theologians and learned doctors of the Church sit in wooden tiers, examining Jeanne.  Archbishop Regnault is among them.  So too is Jean d'Aulon -- but he as a silent, albeit supportive observer. Jeanne stands in the center of the room, hands folded, as though on trial.  She's evidently been here many hours.
52) 3) dialog: Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
52) 24) dialog: Jeanne, be patient... Jeanne turns on him --
53) 3) text: Fine... let's look like a man! Aulon grabs her by the wrist to take the sword from her -
53) 4) dialog: Jeanne, stop it!
53) 6) dialog: He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
53) 8) dialog: Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly! He finally manages to grab the sword from her...
53) 9) dialog: Raymond -- bring me scissors! Louis -- fetch that mirror! The two page boys hop to it, but when Louis brings the mirror, Jeanne slaps it from his hand...
53) 10) dialog: Jeanne, stop getting so angry about everything...!  Calm down! Jeanne stares at him.
54) 0) text: Dunois reads the parchment that Aulon hands to him...
55) 0) text: As Jeanne's letter continues, Aulon walks across the broken stone bridge that once connected the city to the south bank of the Loire.  Two-thirds the way across, the bridge ends abruptly, leaving a yawning gap between us an the fortress of the Tourelles.
57) 0) text: Aulon is still waiting at the end of the broken bridge.
58) 0) text: Aulon hesitates, then softly opens the door.  He tiptoes into the room, looks at Jeanne, then at Louis, who has fallen asleep with the scissors still clasped somewhat dangerously to his chest.  Aulon gently removes them.  As he places them on the table, Jeanne murmurs in her sleep, but without opening her eyes.
58) 2) dialog: Uh... they said... they will think about it.
58) 4) dialog: But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow. Jeanne is almost asleep again...

74) 0) text: They enter the shell-shattered sanctuary of a gothic chapel where Aulon directs them to lay Jeanne against the wall.  In the distance we can hear the muffled sounds of war, but in here it is strangely quiet. The great war-lords stand in a semi-circle, pathetically wringing their hands, like the seven dwarves bereaving th stricken Snow White.  The sight of tears trickling down L Hire's scarred cheeks is as touching as it is pathetic. Aulon wipes her brow, leaning in very close to feel her pulse and whether her mouth exhales breath.  He turns to Raymond, who stands close by with Louis --
74) 1) dialog: Go and find the physician... I saw him with the supplies. Raymond races off...
74) 3) dialog: It's in so deep -- I'm afraid she'll bleed to death if we pull it out...
74) 11) dialog: Jeanne... we thought we'd lost you!
74) 13) dialog: Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
74) 16) dialog: You must stay still till the physician arrives!
74) 19) dialog: Jeanne, you will die if that arrow stays in you much longer... Jeanne suddenly seizes the arrow and yanks it out of her body.  Blood spurts -- the suddenness and violence of her action catches the men unaware, and it's a moment before Aulon can stem the flow with his hand.  Jeanne looks at the arrow before throwing it aside...
74) 21) dialog: Jeanne... please... you must stay calm... you must rest... please! He lays her back down.  Jeanne whispers to him, intimately.
74) 23) dialog: I promise... Jeanne smiles -- then suddenly collapses...
74) 25) dialog: Quickly... do something! The Physician kneels beside her and listens for any sound of life.  All the Captains crowd closer and closer, and a we too move closer, we hear the sound of deep breathing, almost a snore.
75) 0) text: Dunois surveys his army's attempt to storm the English battery.  It is now dusk, and without Jeanne the battle has become a half-hearted affair.  He turns to a trumpete as Aulon comes running up...
75) 1) dialog: Jeanne's alive!
75) 3) dialog: We have to press home the attack!
75) 6) dialog: But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
75) 8) dialog: But that was her order!
77) 5) text: ... life for a life! ... a final FLASH, and her whole army is now a seething swarm of SKELETONS.  With a curdling cry of vengeance the race forward, passing either side of her... Jeanne turns to see the skeleton army heading across a bizarre bridge and onto the moonlit battery, flowing either side of the 8 year-old BOY she saw in the woods as a child.  Intrigued, Jeanne follows him, but by the time she reaches him, the boy has disappeared.  The skeletons have also vanished, to be replaced by an army of little English boys in man-sized armor, heading toward a distant figure. The boy-soldiers are being welcomed by the beautiful MAN Jeanne saw earlier.  He smiles at her, extending his arms in a Christ-like gesture of embrace... As Jeanne approaches him, others turn to welcome her -- Aulon, Dunois, Alencon... finally La Hire, holding out hi arms --

89) 5) dialog: Well...
90) 0) text: Jeanne leads Aulon through the ruined house to the far end, where a window overlooks the river-moat that separates the battery from the Tourelles.
102) 0) text: Aulon gapes in horror... but then suddenly Jeanne is back up on her feet again.  Gripping her banner, she dashes forward toward the portcullis, implanting it just as Redbeard opens a little sliding grille -- Jeanne jabs her banner through --
113) 0) text: Jeanne is screaming at Aulon, who is gripping her blood- splattered face as the Man did...
113) 1) dialog: Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
113) 3) dialog: It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said! Jeanne looks about her in a daze.  La Hire strides over, arms extended, extravagant as always --
115) 5) dialog: Jeanne, no... But Dunois silences him, indicating to Gilles that he should accompany her.
118) 0) text: The crowd goes wild as Jeanne rides through the streets o Rheims, carrying her banner in triumph.  She is followed by Aulon and her two page boys, and is accompanied by soldiers who do their best to hold the ecstatic crowd at bay.  At the far end of the street:  a magnificent cathedral.
120) 0) text: Two tiers of boys sing in plainsong as Charles enters through a small door and into the vastness of the crowded Cathedral.  It is filled to capacity, with Jeanne's comrades-in-arms filling the front pews like eager fans, straining for a glimpse of her. Tremoille waddles behind Charles, with Regnault, Yolande and Richmond in tow.  Next, the two page boys -- and then at last the main attraction as far as this congregation i concerned -- the crowd lets out an audible gasp as Jeanne enters in her white armor, carrying her proud, war-scarre banner and escorted by Jean d'Aulon. La Hire is so moved at the sight that he has to wipe away big soppy tears (for sentimentality was ever the flip-sid of cruelty).  Alencon and Dunois likewise gaze at their adored one, though Gilles is perhaps more taken with the cherubic choir boys... Jeanne trembles with emotion.  This is the peak of her career, and she knows it, and she's making the most of it As the little procession reaches the nave, all but Charle filter aside.  He walks forward alone to where Archbishop Regnault is standing -- a few paces -- then stops, turns -- and holds out his hands to Jeanne. The crowd gasp with approval at the unprecedented gesture... La Hire briefly claps, before being dug in the ribs by Gilles... but the kingly act provokes jealous looks from Regnault and Tremoille... Jeanne hesitates, then is almost willed on by the crowd into joining Charles.  She stands a little aside as he kneels.  Regnault sprinkles the Holy Oil on his sovereign's head...
121) 0) text: Jeanne gasps -- sways... Torrential rain, sweeping across the grey, mud-filled moa in great curtains.  She's standing on the bank above the moat, looking across at the massive city walls where ladders have been set up.  Aulon catches up with her...
121) 1) dialog: Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
121) 3) text: We need more brushwood! (to Aulon)
121) 5) dialog: Because there's an arrow in your leg. She looks down and there it is, poking out her leg:  an arrow has penetrated her armor.
124) 0) text: Aulon reaches the door to a chapel to find it guarded by Louis and Raymond.
124) 2) dialog: Get out...!

125) 1) dialog: Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
125) 3) dialog: What do your voices say? Jeanne pauses... a long moment, whether or not to confide Finally, and with a bleakness not sensed in her before...
125) 5) dialog: What... what do you mean?
125) 7) dialog: Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
125) 9) dialog: But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you. Jeanne stares at him in bemusement -- then suddenly laughs...
125) 11) dialog: But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
125) 13) dialog: But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
125) 15) dialog: You make it sound so simple...
125) 17) dialog: Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
125) 19) dialog: Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone... Aulon's hand touches Jeanne's hair.  He leans forward, as though being drawn by her eyes and mouth...
125) 20) dialog: I... I just wish I could... I want to... to help you... The moment is a little too intense.  They gaze at each other, then Jeanne suddenly pulls away...
125) 22) dialog: Tell me...

132) 4) dialog: Jeanne, I... I love you, Jeanne.  I love you and... I want to marry you. Jeanne is a little taken aback, but is genuinely touched.
132) 6) dialog: You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart. Jeanne looks at him a beat.
132) 8) dialog: He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
132) 10) dialog: Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
132) 12) dialog: Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
132) 14) dialog: To marry you. A beat... then she looks away.
132) 16) dialog: Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne! She looks at him a moment, knowing that he speaks the truth.
132) 17) dialog: Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
132) 19) dialog: But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
132) 21) dialog: To be killed in battle?
132) 23) dialog: Will you at least let me stay with you?
133) 0) text: SHARP CUT to a Man being felled by a cudgel.  We are in the middle of the battle, and things are not going well for the French.  The citizens and their MAYOR watch anxiously from the draw-bridge and the town walls.  Nearb stands a familiar face:  the battle-scarred Richmond.  Th Mayor and Richmond exchange a glance that chills... Jeanne is struggling to keep her banner aloft... then a cry from close by, and to her horror she sees Raymond collapse with an arrow in his breast.  His faithful companion Louis races to his side, throwing his arms around him. Jeanne jumps down from her horse, but by the time she reaches him, his eyes are closed.  Louis looks up at her, tears brimming.  Aulon rides up alongside Jeanne...

138) 0) text: Aulon goes to see the King in his chamber and hands him a heavy sack.  Tremoille and Regnault are present, as always.

143) 3) dialog: Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat! Charles shivers at the thought.
143) 5) dialog: We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
143) 7) dialog: But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
143) 9) dialog: No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
143) 11) dialog: Because I was at this door when you planned to betray her... and I was at Compiegne when she was betrayed. Charles, Tremoille and Regnault are speechless.  Tremoill breaks the silence --
143) 13) dialog: What do you fear most now... my sword? (eyeing Tremoille)
143) 16) dialog: My sword is long enough for both of you. Sweating now, Tremoille eases himself from behind the King's back.  Charles exhales with relief.
143) 17) dialog: I have always been loyal and true to you, but my allegiance is now at an end.  From now on, my loyalty belongs to Jeanne... ... and Aulon runs from the room, leaving Charles, Tremoille and Regnault in a state of shock.

168) 21) dialog: Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
168) 23) dialog: (preoccupied)
168) 26) dialog: I -- I don't understand...
168) 28) dialog: You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and... She caresses his face with both hands, smiling at him gently.  Aulon continues to talk, but his eyes are beginning to brim with tears... he knows it's useless, that Jeanne has made her decision...
168) 29) dialog: ... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even... (smiling through his tears)
168) 32) dialog: No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore... (crying)
