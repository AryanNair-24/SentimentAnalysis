Tremendous NOISE of battle.  Gurney and a squad of TROOPERS climb through bodies and thick smoke.  Gurney has the Duke's dog safely inside his coat.  The little dog's head sticks out -- looking about.  Gurney strokes the dog's neck when the reach safety behind some rock.  Small glimpses, as the smoke moves this way or that, let them see thousands of Sardaukar fighting.

The Fedaykin and Fremen troops line the walls. Paul's eyes meet Feyd's -- Feyd gives him an evil smile. Paul turns and looks at the Emperor, who stares back defiantly.
