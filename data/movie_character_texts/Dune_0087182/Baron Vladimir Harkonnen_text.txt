The doctor uses a lasbeam on a big sore on the Baron's lips. The Baron is sickly and hugely fat and sweaty and looks like he has been sickly for some time. He turns to Piter as he enters the room.

37) 15) dialog: I will have Arrakis back for myself... he who controls the Spice, controls the universe... and what Piter didn't tell you is we have control of someone who is very close to Duke Leto.  This person... this traitor... will be worth more to us than ten legions of Sardaukar.
37) 17) dialog: (laughs)

She is gagged and tied.  She looks up. She sees the huge Baron Harkonnen staring down at her.  In the distance she HEARS the battle raging.
108) 2) dialog: The drug was timed.  Dr. Yueh has been very valuable to us....  What a pity you must remain gagged.  We can't let ourselves be swayed by your witch's Voice, now, can we?

112) 1) dialog: (to Yueh - quietly)
112) 4) dialog: You wish to join her... join her, then. Piter moves to Yueh, a knife glistening in his hand. It flashes into his back.  A GASP escapes Yueh's throat, a sad look passing over his face, as if to say "I thought as much."  He stands stiffly, then falls gasping.  He tastes his own blood, then dies.
112) 5) dialog: Take him away.
118) 2) dialog: Duke Leto Atreides.  Someone's torn the insignia off your uniform.  Such carelessness. Leto shows no sign that he has heard.

118) 17) text: He's crying!  He's crying, Piter.  What does he mean? Piter moves forward.  The Baron sees a suculent piece of chicken skin on the table.  He picks up the plate, then the chicken skin. Leto's POV:  It's grown HAZY again.  The Baron is beginning to move away, reaching for the small piece of chicken skin.  Piter leans close to Leto. DUKE LETO
118) 18) text: Now! We hear a CRUNCH, hear a tumultuous RUSHING SOUND as Piter's face is pushed forcibly away.  The Baron is turning, a dumbfounded look on his face.  He drops the plate, and backs away. There is a tremendous ROARING.  Bits of visions of Caladan rush through Leto's ever-darkening consciousness --

172) 18) text: Our shared enemy the Harkonnens, are once again in control of Arrakis.  Stilgar, your leader, has asked me and my mother to crush the Harkonnens.  We must do more than this.  We must totally destroy all spice production on Arrakis.  The Guild and the entire universe depends on spice. "He who can destroy a thing, controls a thing". I will take one hundred of your warriors and train them.  This one hundred will train the thousands that remain.  When the spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to Arrakis.  The Baron and the Emperor himself will be forced to deal with us. Arrakis will become the center of the Universe. (inner voice)

You must care for it if you wish to live.  A poison has been introduced into you, Thufir Hawat.  By milking this smooth little cat body each day you receive your antidote... it must be done each day....  Also, you must do something for me if you wish to live.  You know I lost Piter, my dear Mentat... Thufir gives the Baron a weak, wide-eyed stare.
188) 3) dialog: Feyd, no, no!  Thufir's a Harkonnen now, aren't you Thufir?

250) 0) text: Suddenly the wall behind Alia and the spinning Baron is completely blown away by a BLAST. The Baron floats and spins out into the storm.
