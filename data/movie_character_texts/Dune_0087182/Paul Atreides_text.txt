16) 36) dialog: (inner voice)
16) 37) text: What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
16) 38) dialog: (strange shielded voice)

Paul takes a closer look at the Atreides banner moving in the wind. DUKE LETO (studying the dark sea below)

28) 6) dialog: I see the truth of it.

It is very dark and gets increasingly darker as they descend.  The WIND sound grows.  The air grows colder and damper.  Paul and Jessica share another questioning look.  At the bottom of the stairs they pass through a narrow slot doorway which suddenly opens out on something so totally unexpected it shocks Paul.

A large rock obelisk has been placed near Paul for this demonstration.
173) 1) dialog: The weirding way has long been a Bene Gesserit secret.  With my mother's help, my father isolated an element of the weirding way and externalised it.
173) 3) dialog: Because of the Harkonnen treachery, my father's armies were never able to fully develop this new form.  This is what I will teach you.  You will be the fiercest and most feared fighters in the Universe. Our way of battle is built on rhythm.  You understand rhythm like this but you do not yet understand the rhythm of the higher sounds, sounds that heal and build... sounds that destroy.  Motion is the base. You understand the motion... but you do not yet understand the motion that heals and builds... motions that destroy... Orato! (he moves forward)
173) 8) dialog: Move back! Paul also moves back.  He switches on his weirding module.  He opens his mouth and makes a small SOUND, which the module amplifies.
173) 9) dialog: Chuksa! The sound shatters the obelisk to pieces.  The one hundred Fremen YELL with surprise and awe. 100 FREMEN
173) 12) dialog: This is part of the weirding way that we will teach you.  Some thoughts have a certain sound... that being the equivalent to a form.  Through sound and motion you will be able to paralyze nerves, shatter bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy or burst his organs....  We will kill until no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air. 100 FREMEN

174) 3) text: So you are the ones. She turns away towards the monks who are very busy blowing horns and waving pots of burning spice, purifying the area of the rite.  Several Fremen blow on dip sticks and a FEMALE CHOIR begins a haunting chorale as the giant pipe organ blows beautiful low notes below. Paul looks to his mother. He then sees Chani. CU Chani. CU Paul -- he cannot stop looking at her. Stilgar motions to Paul.
174) 5) text: Do you know the Water of Life?... Come... ...Watch... the mystery of mysteries... the end and the beginning. He shows Paul through a narrow passageway -- almost a slot through the stone to a small room.  Through an opening in the stone wall, Paul is shown a very strange and somewhat horrifying scene.

198) 0) text: Paul freezes.  He lets the worm get closer and closer.  The HEAT WAVES distort the gigantic form, making it more hideous -- more foreign.  He moves forward.  The others watch anxiously.  This worm is big.  It is so much larger than imaged.  Its top towers 125 feet in the air.  The segments are each ten feet wide.
199) 0) text: Paul gets close and running alongside, he plants the hook under a segment and pulls back.  The SOUND is excruciatingly loud.  The sand is so deep and more is being thrown out beneath the body of the worm. Paul gets caught in it and falls. He narrowly escapes being sucked under the beast.  He gets up -- runs again and plants the hook once more.  He runs faster, bending the segment open to expose the tender flesh.
200) 0) text: Suddenly the worm begins to turn.  Paul pulls himself up the body as it turns -- holding onto the hook.  Soon he is fifty -- sixty -- seventy feet off the ground -- going higher.  The giant worm gets the second thumper and Paul at that moment climbs to the top.  He plants the second hook.

206) 1) dialog: We surprised a band of smugglers.
206) 3) text: Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen. Paul and Stilgar move through the smoke.  A man runs up with a maula pistol aimed at Paul but Paul spins and punctures the man's chest with a sound from his weirding module.  Paul turns and a large figure comes through the smoke.  They surprise each other. The figure holds a gun.
206) 4) dialog: Gurney!... The figure stops -- stunned. PAUL (CONT'D)
206) 7) text: Paul!!  Paul!!

213) 0) text: There is a growing, powerful sound of a worm approaching as Paul and Chani are lying together in the darkness of their sleeping chamber.  Paul's eyes snap open and he sees Chani looking down at him (the last image of the future in the desert).

223) 0) text: Navigator chewing giant eye and spewing blood and light and sounds.  Paul's mouth double exposes over Navigator and eye.  The sound from Paul's mouth destroys the Navigator and opens the Alam. Navigator bursts into a huge light ring and we quickly travel through ring after ring and masses of liquid stars.  The light increases until it is blinding and then in the light...
226) 0) text: Chani looks to the Fedaykin, then they look at Paul who lies motionless.  She cuts the rope bonds with her crysknife.  Her fingers tremble as does the whole of the desert. Paul's eyes snap open.  He sits up slowly.  Chani stares at him in awe.
227) 0) text: A huge wave crashes and Paul sees the image of his father.  Paul slowly gets to his knees, then stands.
228) 1) dialog: Father!...  Father!  THE SLEEPER HAS AWAKENED. Giant echoes of this phrase reverberate across the vast desert.  The worms bend back into the sand and leave with thundering power. MUSIC FULL. 247. through 250.   (Deleted)

256) 0) text: Paul enters the Palace hall and the first thing he sees is the giant bull's head.  The horns have been blown off and the Atreides banner has been stuffed and wired into the mouth. A WIND moans through the Palace. Paul turns.  Gurney and several guards bring in the Emperor, Irulan, the Reverend Mother, Sardaukar generals, Guildsmen, Feyd and Thufir.  The Fedaykin and Fremen troops line the walls. Paul's eyes meet Feyd's -- Feyd gives him an evil smile. Paul turns and looks at the Emperor, who stares back defiantly.  Paul moves his gaze to Irulan, who lowers her eyes.  He then sees his old teacher, Thufir Hawat, whose tired eyes wander helplessly.
256) 2) dialog: Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
256) 4) dialog: Let him stand free! The Emperor turns nervously to Feyd, who passes a golden dagger to Thufir.
256) 8) text: Thufir.  Come. Thufir approaches Paul, concealing the knife.  They come face to face.  The Emperor seems strangely tense at this moment.  Paul notices this.  He looks Thufir over. PAUL (CONT'D) (inner voice)
256) 11) text: Do you need my life, old friend? He turns his back on him. PAUL (CONT'D) (quiet)
256) 13) dialog: I mean this, Thufir.  If you are to strike, do it now. Thufir's hand rises, as Jessica gasps, but the old Mentat pulls his heart plug out with a quick tearing motion.  Paul turns and catches him as he sags. His head lolls back and he looks up to Paul urgently.
256) 16) dialog: (to the guards)
256) 18) dialog: Emperor Shadam the IV... there are Guild Heighliners above us containing many Great Houses of the Lansraad....  SEND THEM

258) 0) text: The Guildsmen in the room are MOANING and SCREAMING and swarming out towards the doorway -- the Fremen stop them.  The Emperor and all are amazed and frightened.  There is a long hush.  The old Reverend Mother then turns and glares at Paul. PAUL (CONT'D)
258) 4) dialog: You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand. REVEREND MOTHER
258) 6) dialog: (using The Voice)
258) 12) dialog: (to Emperor)
258) 17) dialog: The Emperor's blade. Feyd takes up the Emperor's blade with a smile. Paul takes out his crysknife.  They begin to circle each other. Paul smiles, circling still.  Suddenly, Feyd leaps, his blade jabbing savagely outward, but Paul easily evades it, moving away.  They begin to circle again. He makes another pass at Paul that comes dangerously close, but again, Paul is away, a frozen smile on his face.
258) 22) text: Who is the little one?  A pet, perhaps? Will she deserve my special attentions? Paul jabs out, his crysknife slashing.  Feyd grabs his arm, and Paul his, the two men locked in a straining clinch.  Feyd presses his right hip closer and closer to Paul's body.  Paul strains to keep it away.  Suddenly, the gom jabbar flips out of Feyd's girdle, but on the left side, and he lunges powerfully with it at Paul, who just barely misses taking it in his skin.  He throws Feyd back, but not before Feyd's feet strike out, sending Paul to the floor.  Feyd leaps onto him.
258) 24) text: You see... your death... my blade will finish you. Suddenly, Paul, with lightning swiftness, pushes Feyd up and over.  He is on top of him in a flash. Paul's crysknife flashes up, thrusting upward through Feyd's jaw.  Feyd's mouth opens as the knife continues up through his tongue and through to his brain.  Feyd's eyes go wild, then glaze over as he jerks dead on the floor.  Paul slowly gets to his feet, breathing heavily.  Anger still seething in him, Paul issues a SOUND -- a loud, horrible, powerful sound, and Feyd's internal organs rupture and the stone floor under him cracks open.  The Fedaykin smile. FEDAYKIN #2
258) 25) text: Usul no longer needs the weirding module. Everyone stares in disbelief.  Paul looks to the Emperor.
258) 26) dialog: Now, I will tell you how it will be. Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way for an Atreides to take the throne.
258) 29) dialog: You will sit on a throne on Selusa Secundus, your prison planet.  Either that or you will die. The Emperor is still.  Paul moves to Chani. PAUL (CONT'D) (to Chani)
258) 31) text: ...my love. Paul turns back to the others. Jessica turns to Chani and whispers to her.
258) 33) dialog: The Fremen have the word of Muad'dib. They will have their Holy War to cleanse the Universe... they will have Arrakis... Dune... their planet.  There will be flowing water here open to the sky and rich green oases.  For the spice there will always be some desert.  There will be fierce winds and trials to toughen men. We Fremen have a saying... (he stares at the Reverend Mother)
259) 0) text: Paul opens his mouth and issues an ever increasing wind.  Lightning and thunder begin.  Clouds begin to form over the Palace.  In the half-light of dusk, thousands of Fremen watch the sky.  Giant golden lights are illuminated and their rays shoot far into the sky illuminating the growing clouds.  Five tremendous bolts of lightning suddenly unleash a downpour of RAIN ON ARRAKIS.  The Fremen stand awestruck as they are drenched with water falling from the sky.
260) 0) text: WE MOVE through Paul's glowing blue eyes into beautiful blue luminescent light. A gigantic WIND arises, and suddenly appearing in the blue light is an ocean of light rolling like gold glass off into infinite.  The blue becomes darker and a golden lotus flower blooms in the night.
