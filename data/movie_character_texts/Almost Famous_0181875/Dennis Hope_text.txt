31) 6) dialog: (completely unthreatening) Hi.
31) 8) dialog: Respectfully. We all have our roots. I believe in bands holding onto their roots. But those roots need to be augmented. I'm gonna tell you the truth —- I may enrage some and enthrall others. I don't really give a fuck. Your manager here needs a manager. Example. If you hadn't run out on the contract in Phoenix, you could have sued over Russell's hand... but you left, negating the contract, forfeiting the deposit, and you effectively traveled a long way to pay that promoter... to electrocute you. Russell looks at his hand. DENNIS HOPE (cont'd) We can all work together. Your damages have put you way into the hole for this tour. Right now you owe the record company more than you've got. But your record's selling, there's money to be made. So I've brought a plane in, we can add more shows to make-up the difference. Respectfully.

I didn't invent the rainy day, man. I just own the best umbrella. He laughs. It's fun. Band members are now listening, curi spellbound. DENNIS HOPE (cont'd) Because as much as you may believe that it will last forever, it does not last forever... your biggest fan right now soon they're going to go to college, gonna wanna buy clothes, spend that money some other way, and you know what? (the final insult) They'll tape your record from a friend's copy. Russell stops fingering his guitar. Shot moves across the faces of the band members. Pain. DENNIS HOPE (cont'd) You've got to take what you can, when you can, while you can. And you've got to do it now. That's what the big boys do. The band squirms, but listens. DENNIS HOPE (cont'd) Because if you think Mick Jagger will still be out there trying to be a rock star at age fifty, you're sadly sadly mistaken. Now he's reaching them. Their slackened roar-weary faces back at the young dynamo.

34) 3) dialog: (to the point) Sorry the plane isn't bigger. It hits her. She looks at William for a clue. His truthfu face does not look away. Now she knows. She turns to the others -- the plane isn't bigger? Shot moves in on Penny she blinks just a little, cutting into the cake, still mu for everybody, covering it all with a layer of sweet gidd laughter. Shot comes to rest behind her, her head turning connect with band members. Each of them look away, nobody maintaining eye contact with her except the one she now d look at. William. She blows out the candles, vamping Mari Monroe-style, and sucks off the frosting seductively, to Russell watches, as we push in on Penny.
