A biker is ripped off a motorcycle.     The BIKE CRASHES. Larry ends up with a jumper on his bike. Another biker tries to kick it off, managing to knock the critter into the motorcycle's spokes. The spider gets munched. But then the courageous biker crashes and is set upon by a hungry jumper. Larry continues riding. But a spider lands on his back and sinks fangs into his spine. Larry yells bloody murder.
