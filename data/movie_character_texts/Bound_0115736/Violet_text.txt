2) 16) dialog: I guessed you were straight black.
2) 20) dialog: My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I  did have a slightly ulterior motive  here.  I was wondering if I could  ask a small favor?
2) 22) dialog: Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person,  so I was wondering if it wasn't a  terrible inconvenience if you could  wait a bit before using power tools.
2) 24) dialog: No, it isn't your fault.  The walls  here are just so thin.
2) 26) dialog: Yes, it really causes problems.   Sometimes it's like you're in the  same room.  But if it's too much  trouble, I understand ...
2) 28) dialog: You're doing everything yourself?
2) 30) dialog: That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of  people who can fix things.  My dad  was like that.  We never had anything  new.  Whenever something broke he  would open it up, tinker with it and  it would work.  His hands were magic.

9) 18) dialog: If you won't take money, how about a  drink?  It's getting late.  You can't  work all night.
9) 21) dialog: What do you want?
9) 23) dialog: A beer.  Of course.
9) 25) dialog: Sit down.
9) 26) text: Corky sits on the black leather couch and Violet returns  with two bottles of Heineken.  Corky sneers.
9) 27) dialog: Thanks again.

9) 41) dialog: Are you surprised that I know what  it is?
9) 43) dialog: I have a tattoo, would you like to  see it?
9) 45) dialog: A woman in upstate New York did it  for me.
9) 47) dialog: Here.  Do you like it?
9) 48) text: Set against the soft white skin of her breast is a bright green-stemmed violet.

9) 56) text: Violet looks at her.
9) 57) dialog: Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to  seduce you.
9) 59) dialog: Because I want to.  I've wanted to  since I first saw you in the elevator.
9) 60) text: Corky watches her, trying to figure her out even as her t presses into Violet's nipple. Inhaling sharply, Violet closes her eyes; she can feel Co staring at her.
9) 61) dialog: You don't believe me.  But I can  prove it to you.
9) 63) dialog: You can't believe me because of what  you see ...

With her hand still stuffed between Violet's legs, Corky  lays her back onto the couch as the kiss becomes more -- More desperate, more hungry until -- We hear the front door unlock and open.
9) 81) text: Violet's eyes pop open and she pushes Corky back.
9) 84) dialog: Yeah.  In here, C.
9) 89) text: Violet stands as Caesar barrels toward the couch.
9) 90) dialog: I didn't expect --
9) 94) dialog: Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
9) 97) dialog: She is working for Bianchinni.
9) 103) dialog: She's doing the work herself.
9) 108) dialog: Jesus, Caesar!

12) 3) dialog: ...  I needed that.
12) 5) text: Corky hands her the beer as Violet sits up a bit.

25) 11) dialog: For Shelly, taking the money was a  way to take from Caesar.  He could  have run at any time, but he didn't  because he didn't want out.
25) 13) dialog: Maybe he did.  He would brag to me  all the time.  He was never afraid  of Caesar because he didn't know  him.  Not like I do.
25) 15) dialog: Caesar lives for these moments.  He  tells me it's just the business, but  I know it's more than that.  He likes  it.  The violence.  I'll catch him  in the bathroom mirror touching his  scars.  He says they remind him who  he his.  They're all like that.   Except maybe Mickey.
25) 17) dialog: He's the part of the business that  the rest of them pretend to be.   |But Mickey doesn't like it like  they do.  I suppose that's why he's  good at it.
25) 18) text: Violet stares at her glass, at the melting ice.
25) 19) dialog: I used to be able to block it out.   I would tell myself that I wasn't  really there so nothing really  mattered.  But I can't do it anymore.
25) 21) dialog: I've been making the same mistake  Shelly made.  But now I know what |I  want.
25) 23) dialog: I want out.  I want a new life.  I  see what I've been waiting for, but  I need you, Corky.
25) 25) dialog: You made a choice once.  Do you think  you would make that same choice again?
