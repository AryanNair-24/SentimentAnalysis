Suddenly a wet paint roller loaded with white paint cuts swath across the ceiling.

9) 127) dialog: Sure.
10) 0) text: Close on the paintbrush, Corky's fingers pushing through separating the black bristles under the running water. When the brush is clean, she flicks it dry and resets the edge. She goes to the sink to wash her hands when she stops,  noticing her left hand. It is the hand that was between Violet's legs. She is about to smell her finger when she sees herself in the mirror.
10) 1) dialog: What are you doing?
10) 3) dialog: What am I doing?  I'm fucking up,  that's what I'm doing.
11) 0) text: It is late, the area burnished with amber street light.   Corky walks from the building to her truck. She climbs inside and slides the key into the ignition, w suddenly the passenger door opens and -- Violet gets in.  Stunned, Corky stares at her.

12) 1) dialog: I can see again.
12) 2) text: Violet smiles. Slowly, Corky gets up and goes to the fridge.  She grabs beer and presses it to her sweating forebead. After a moment, she lowers it, gently pressing the cold c elsewhere.  Eyes closed, she lets out a long "Ahh." Violet hears the sizzle-pop of the beer as Corky returns the bed. She holds the beer to Violet's lips and tilts the can,  watching Violet's throat as she drinks. Violet's eyes open.
12) 4) dialog: Tell me about it.
12) 5) text: Corky hands her the beer as Violet sits up a bit.

12) 31) dialog: I can still hear that sound, those  quarters, because right then something  clicked inside of me.  Some instinct  took over and as everyone, including  Waxman, dove down, I reached up and  emptied the cash register.
12) 33) dialog: I gave most of the money to my mom.   I told her I found it at the  trainyard.  She was so happy she  cried, calling me her lucky charm.   Fifteen years later, I guess my luck  ran out.
12) 35) dialog: Sometimes I tell myself that I didn't  have a choice, that stealing was  surviving.  Usually I can admit that's  bullshit.  I did it because it was a  way out.  It was easy and I was good  at it, real good.
12) 37) dialog: I don't usually talk this much.  I  guess I have been rehabilitated.
12) 40) dialog: I guess I wanted to.

17) 15) dialog: I'm not afraid of anything.
17) 17) dialog: I know!  You can't understand, because  we're different, Violet.  We're  different.
17) 19) dialog: How can you sit in that bed and say  that?
17) 21) dialog: Let me guess.  This is where you  tell me that what matters is on the  inside.  That inside you, there is a  little dyke just like me?
17) 23) dialog: Is that what her daddy tells her?
17) 25) dialog: What are you saying?  That you don't  have sex with men?
17) 27) dialog: For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard  you!  Thin walls, remember?

21) 0) text: Corky's legs jut out from the old wicker vanity as she  finishes detaching its anchors and pipe work.

24) 0) text: Corky can't stand it anymore.  She throws her tools down, leaves the bathroom and finds -- Violet waiting in the main room.  Both women stand apart silence. Violet seems on the verge of saying something but doesn't know how to start.  Her lip begins to quiver; her eyes se the room, returning to Corky each time. The violence in the next room can still be heard.
24) 1) dialog: Violet?  Are you all right?
24) 2) text: Almost unnoticeably, Violet shakes her bead.  Corky puts arm around her.
24) 3) dialog: Come on.  Let's go.

27) 4) text: Corky quietly swallows that pill.  It begins to rain.
27) 6) dialog: Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do  you have any idea what you are saying?   You are asking me to help you fuck  the mob.
27) 8) dialog: These people are serious, Violet.   If you want to know how serious, ask  Shelly.  They're worse than any cop  because they have lots of money and  no rules.  You fuck them, you've got  to do it right.
27) 10) dialog: I am, but ...
27) 12) dialog: All right, let's say for the moment  that I believe everything you are  saying.
27) 14) dialog: I didn't say that, but since you  did, let's say that you are.  It  would have been easy to set Shelly  up.  You could have got him killed  knowing that Caesar would bring the  money to the apartment.
27) 16) dialog: All you would need to keep yourself  clean would be someone unconnected,  someone like me.
27) 18) dialog: I'm just making a point.  You have  no idea what you're asking.  How  much trust two people need to do  something like this.
27) 20) dialog: For me, stealing is a lot like sex.   Two people that want the same thing  sit in a room and they talk, they  start to plan and it's like flirting,  a kind of foreplay, because the more  they talk about it, the wetter they  get.
27) 22) dialog: The difference is, I can have sex  with someone I just met, someone I  hardly know, but to steal I need to  know someone like I know myself.
27) 24) dialog: I think ...

28) 25) dialog: Come to my place in the morning.   Early, okay?
28) 27) text: Corky's hands twitch, and then flex against the ropes tha bind them. A reflex echoes through her body, muscles spasm and limbs jerk against their bonds. As if in a dream, she struggles, trying to get free, figh toward the edge of consciousness until -- She seems to succumb, slipping back into stillness. We move toward her face, her closed eyes as we again hear the voices in her head.

35) 29) text: Something occurs to Corky.
35) 30) dialog: Does Johnnie hit on you?
35) 32) dialog: Has Caesar ever seen him?
