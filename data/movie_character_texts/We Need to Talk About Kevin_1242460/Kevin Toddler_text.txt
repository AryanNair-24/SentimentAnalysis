Young, smiling and carefree in Amsterdam. The TV switches off abruptly. CUT TO BLACK. O.S. THE BEEP OF THE ALARM CLOCK.
152) 1) dialog: Hey Al, you still got something on your face... Kevin is led in. Eva notices a change in his demeanor bef he says a word. All that snide condescension and the swag have fallen away. A couple of fresh scratches on his face his knuckles grazed. He’s wearing an orange jumpsuit- it’s odd to see him wear something not only the normal size but too big for him.

He draws a dark rectangular wooden box about five inches from his pocket, polishes the oiled wood with the wad of toilet paper it’s been wrapped in. Carefully he slides the box across the table keeping two fingers on the top, the workmanship is surprisingly fine. She reaches, but he keeps his fingers on it fast.
