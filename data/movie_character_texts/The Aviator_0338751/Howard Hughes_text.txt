20) 68) dialog: It went into the planes. And a lot more.
20) 70) dialog: I mean my money, sir. Brewster is immediately alarmed, realizes he has stumbled He has given Howard the opening he has been waiting for.
20) 75) dialog: (very quietly) You see the thing is I care very much about aviation. It's been the great joy of my life. So I put my own money into these planes ... I've lost millions, Mr. Chairman. And I'll go on losing millions. It's just what I do. The chamber is silent. Hanging on every word.
20) 76) dialog: And if I lost a lot of the government's money during the war, I hope folks will put that in perspective ... More than 60 other airplanes ordered from such firms as Boeing and Lockheed and Douglas and Northrop never saw action either. In all, more than 800 million dollars was spent during the war on planes that never flew. More than 6 billion on other weapons that were never delivered. A beat. The coup de grace:
20) 77) dialog: And yet Hughes Aircraft ~- with her 56 million -- is the only firm under investigation here today. A tremor through the chamber.
20) 78) dialog: I can't help but think that has a little more to do with TWA than with planes that didn't fly. Brewster slumps.
20) 79) dialog: I have only one more thing to say to this committee, and that's about the Hercules ... Now, I'm supposed to be many things which are not complimentary. I am supposed to be capricious. I have been called @ playboy. I have even been called an eccentric. But I do not believe I have the reputation of being a liar ... I put the sweat of my life into this thing. My reputation is wrapped up an it. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
20) 81) dialog: So believe me when I say that if the Hercules fails to fly, I will leave the country and I will not return. And I mean it. Then Howard slowly stands. (CONTINITED)
20) 83) dialog: Now, Mr. Chairman ... you can subpoena me, you can arrest me, you can claim I've taken a run-out powder but I've had enough of this nonsense. Good afternoon. He turns and begins walking out. Noah is stunned. The spe heartily approve. A smattering of applause. Brewster sinks in his chair. It's over. Howard has won. Howard continues to walk out of the chamber as the crowd applauds. This image is exactly mirrored in...
20) 93) dialog: Come up front, Professor... Professor Fitz walks with Howard and Glenn to the forward stations. Glenn straps himself into the co-pilot's seat, switches on his units. Howard settles into the pilot's seat as Professor Fitz ne glances out one of the forward windows. The choppy waves harbor are very far below.
20) 94) dialog: Why don't you strap yourself in right over there -- (points to an auxiliary engineer's station) -- should be able to see great. Professor Fitz does so, struggling a bit with the restrai harness. Howard makes a quick visual check of the complex instrume panel before him. It is a beautiful anarchy of dials, instruments and gauges. A series of four throttle levers right and an elegantly designed wheel ahead of him. baAawmrrien)
20) 96) dialog: Okay, Odie, let's power her up. They flip various switches and the plane's eight propelle slowly begin to spin. An echoing, distant thrum from the props.
20) 97) dialog: Advancing master throttles.
20) 100) dialog: Understood. Lower fifteen degrees of flaps.
20) 104) dialog: Throttling back for starboard turn 1-8-0.
20) 106) dialog: How does she sound, Odie?
20) 108) dialog: Professor, would you do me a favor? Would you look out that window there and tell me what the wind's doing? Professor Fitz peers out the window, trying to gauge the His eyes dart from the waves below to a bird flying above anything to give him a sense of speed and direction.
20) 110) dialog: Would you call that a tailwind, Professor? Professor Fitz looks at him.
20) 112) text: Howard glances to Glenn. Pokes his lucky fedora a little on his head.
20) 113) dialog: Advancing master throttles.
20) 115) dialog: Lemme hear it, Odie.
21) 0) text: The mighty Hercules is back in her berth. She overlooks a celebration party. Mobs of friends and we wishers. Johnny Meyer is talking with Ava. Jack Frye is conferring happily with TWA executives. Howard stands with an arm around Professor Fitz, shaking and reliving the flight.
21) 1) dialog: -+- Hell, I don't deserve the credit. All goes to Professor Fitz here, he made the wind blow right. Couldn't have done it without him ... Excuse me. Howard sees Noah across the room. Goes to him.
21) 4) dialog: Thanks. Now listen, I've been thinking about something. Something new -- now get ready: .jet airplanes. You know anything about jets?
21) 6) dialog: Oh, it will be. I'll call you later. He strides off. Noah watches him go, smiles. More adventu Howard snatches Ava away from Johnny Meyer:
21) 7) dialog: Excuse us, Johnny ... (he walks with her) ... Feel like going to Paris?
21) 9) dialog: Couple months. TWA's starting up flights to Europe. Thought I might pilot the first one myself. Oughta be some fun.
21) 11) dialog: I'll buy you anything you want.
21) 13) dialog: Dinner then. We got a date?
21) 15) dialog: I'll be back in a second. Don't go anywhere.
21) 18) dialog: You want me to? He gives her a quick wink and goes toward Glenn. She watc go, smiles. Howard catches up with Glenn, walks with him.
21) 19) dialog: Odie, I want to get started on jet technology. What do you know about it?
21) 21) dialog: We need to start thinking about using that technology on commercial airliners. Now, Lockheed worked on the F- 80. Let's get Bob Gross on the phone and see if he can help us out.
21) 23) dialog: "Course now. We gotta get into it. Jets are gonna be the way of the future. The way of the future. The way of the future. The way of the future... Glenn's face. Not wanting to believe.
21) 24) dialog: The way of the future. The way of the future. The way of the future. The way of the future... Howard's face. Panic. Fear. He is defenseless. It's finished.
21) 25) dialog: The way of the future. The way of the future. The way of the future... Glenn quickly takes Howard's arm and pulls him through th party.
21) 26) dialog: The way of the future. The way of the future. The way of the future. The way of the future...
21) 28) dialog: The way of the future. The way of the future... Glenn quickly checks a bathroom, empty. Gently pushes How inside as Howard continues to repeat.
21) 30) dialog: (nods) The way of the future. The way of the future... Glenn shuts the bathroom door and hurries away.
22) 0) text: Howard stands in the filthy hanger bathroom, looking arou
22) 1) dialog: The way of the future. The way of the future. The way of the future... He goes to a filthy sink. Reaches out to wash his hands-- HOWARD'S POV -- EXTREME CLOSEUP -- the sink. It really is this time. A foul, stained cauldron. Howard stops. Hands suspended in midair.
22) 2) dialog: The way of the future. The way of the future. The way of the future... He looks up at himself in the dingy mirror over the sink.
22) 3) dialog: The way of the future. The way of the future. The way of the future... He sees his face in the mirror, and then the image change IN THE MIRROR: A long, dark corridor...
22) 5) dialog: The way of the future. The way of the future... We are inexorably moving toward the one open doorway at t of the hall. As we reach the door we fade to...
22) 7) dialog: The way of the future. The way of the future... We see a single reclining chair in front of the TV. A sha figure sits in the chair. On the TV, the newsreel footage of Howard after the Hercu flight:
22) 8) dialog: Well, I'd say the airplane seems to be fairly successful. Ladies and gentlemen, you're looking at the way of the future... We finally see the figure is sitting in the chair. We don really see him well but get a sense ... a haunting sense a thin, tall man wrapped in the robe. A beard and long ha We see shadows and images; contours and details illuminat the flickering TV light. It is Howard. 63 years old. Watching himself on TV.
23) 0) text: Howard stands, looking at himself in the mirror.
23) 2) dialog: The way of the future. The way of the future... In his eyes, he sees it all. His future. Already written. That future is the price he will have to pay for his triu Icarus into the sun. Prometheus on the rock. Is the price too high? In Howard's eyes, we get our answer. His answer. We see a strange sort of acceptance. Of triumph. Maybe even peace.
23) 3) dialog: The way of the future. The way of the future... Fade to black. The End.
