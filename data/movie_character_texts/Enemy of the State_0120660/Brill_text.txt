84) 7) dialog: Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field. (prying away DEAN's heel) My name doesn't matter. CLOSE ON DEAN's HEEL - a hollow compartment reveals a miniature tracking device. The MAN removes it, then returns the shoe.
84) 8) dialog: A tracker. Thousand yard range. They're close. The MAN reaches in a trash can, removes a potato-chip bag, wraps it around the tracker and flushes it down the toilet.
84) 9) dialog: C'mon. "BRILL" goes through the window. DEAN eyes the window, not sure. He eyes the door. Same feeling.
85) 0) text: DEAN crawls through the window to a loading dock. "BRILL" motions him to follow as he moves off into the shadows. The sounds of the window OPENING behind them, followed by FOOTSTEPS. "BRILL" shoves Dean behind a dumpster and removes his gun as two men run by. The STEPS FADE. "BRILL" looks. They're gone.
86) 0) text: Establishing. A closed farmer's market by the terminal. Several cars are parked. One's a cab. "BRILL" opens the driver's door. DEAN grabs the front passenger door.
86) 1) dialog: No. In back like you're a customer.
87) 0) text: "BRILL" sits in the driver's seat, eyes flickering to all views, as DEAN climbs in the back. "BRILL" flips on the meter and guns into traffic.
87) 1) dialog: What happened?
87) 3) dialog: DePinto's dead.
87) 5) dialog: They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about Zavitz? "BRILL" starts to weave in and out of traffic. He looks in the mirror - the Chevy's also weaving several cars behind.
87) 7) dialog: You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
87) 9) dialog: And you were the last one to talk to him.
87) 11) dialog: What'd he say to you?
87) 13) dialog: What'd he give to you?
87) 15) dialog: Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
87) 18) dialog: He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
87) 21) dialog: Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
87) 23) dialog: Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know. The cab is rear-ended hard by the Chevy. Their necks snap back from the force.
87) 24) dialog: Shit! WHAM! They're hit again. "BRILL" pulls out a communicator
87) 25) dialog: 209 to anyone! I need some help here!
87) 27) dialog: (trying again) This is 209! Does anyone copy?! Then "BRILL" sees that the alley empties into a busy street, then a bakery shop. He slams the brakes. Tires screech smoke but it's no use. The powerful Chevy pushes the cab, bumper to bumper, toward the street. "BRILL" grips the wheel. It's all he can do as the cab rockets into cross traffic and-- BLAM! They're broad-sided by a delivery truck. The cab is shoved sideways along the street and into a fire- hydrant, finally stopping under jetting water from the broken main. DEAN slowly opens his eyes. Water pours in everywhere. "BRILL" is sticking halfway through a window, not moving. Seeing "BRILL"'s pistol, DEAN grabs it and crawls from the wreckage.
93) 6) dialog: You knew the deal. No contact.
93) 8) dialog: One of many people who would live a word with you.
93) 10) dialog: You've heard of the National Security Agency?
93) 12) dialog: That's who they are.
93) 14) dialog: Yes.
93) 16) dialog: (starting to leave) Okay.
93) 18) dialog: You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
93) 20) dialog: (reaching in his pocket) I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away. BRILL pulls out a disk-shaped object the size of a walk-man.
93) 22) dialog: It's a SAT-tracker.
93) 24) dialog: Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
93) 26) dialog: 230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
93) 28) dialog: It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
93) 30) dialog: If I knew, they'd be after me. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
93) 32) dialog: Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow. A helicopter hovers near the Washington Monument. BRILL eyes it cautiously.
93) 34) dialog: They're spooks.
93) 36) dialog: Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
93) 38) dialog: No shit.
93) 40) dialog: Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
93) 42) dialog: Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even. BRILL turns to leave--
93) 44) dialog: And you won't. Now move--
93) 46) dialog: (taking out his pistol) They froze your accounts. Get outa my way. DEAN continues blocking the door, maintaining calm even as BRILL's pistol is pressed firmly to his forehead.
93) 49) dialog: (pause) If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury. (giving DEAN his pistol) And take this. And with that, he's gone. DEAN eyes the gun. He walks to the ledge, looking at the city. DEAN'S POV: Several vehicles quietly pull up to the building. MEN storm out an move inside. DEAN quickly backs away.
116) 0) text: DEAN's asleep. There's a SOFT SHUFFLING SOUND. The CAMERA EXPLORES for the source, moving by the windows, flashing neon, a TV and finally, the door. We PUSH CLOSER as a MULE TOOL snakes under the door. The tool pops upright against the door's inside. The strap drapes over the doorknob and tightens. The doorknob turns and opens. SOMEONE slips in-- CLOSE ON DEAN asleep. A HAND covers his mouth. DEAN's eyes go wide. Then he sees it's BRILL...
116) 1) dialog: (whispering) Get dressed. We're leaving.
116) 3) dialog: Move it. EXT. CAPE CHARLES - 4 A.M. Establishing. The 10-mile Chesapeake Bay Bridge crosses the Bay like a serpent worming toward distant Norfolk. Traffic is thin at this hour.
117) 0) text: BRILL drives with DEAN riding shotgun.
117) 2) dialog: I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
117) 4) dialog: I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
117) 6) dialog: The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
117) 8) dialog: Did you call anyone?
117) 10) dialog: I mean did you call anyone.
117) 12) dialog: Jesus!
117) 14) dialog: What'd I tell you?
117) 16) dialog: What'd I tell you?
117) 18) dialog: What'd I tell you?
117) 20) dialog: I told you no calls. BRILL does a bootleggers U-turn. Several cars pass by in the opposite direction.
117) 22) dialog: You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
117) 24) dialog: Oh, I'll bet that threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice! BRILL turns off the headlights, does another U-turn, pulls off on an emergency road and stops. He turns off the engine, rolls down the window, looks up into the night sky and listens. BRILL's POV: A cloudy night. Silent except for the water and a distant fog-horn. No sounds of aircraft.
117) 26) dialog: A hundred and fifty.
118) 0) text: Re-establishing. A massive, dark place filled with glowing monitors. CLOSE ON A MONITOR - displaying a live SAT feed showing a thermograph image of Brill's truck. The color heat image of BRILL looking upward is fairly clear. He pops his head back into the truck and pulls onto the road. The satellite continues tracking the truck.
118) 1) dialog: It's a consumated marriage.
119) 0) text: BRILL drives along a high fence surrounding acres of empty warehouses, docks and rust-bitten fences. He's still on constant alert - looking for sign of their presence.
119) 1) dialog: The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it. (stopping the car near the gate) The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world. (handing DEAN the keys) At least it better be.
119) 3) dialog: None of your business.
119) 5) dialog: I was a traffic analyst. DEAN gives him a look that says, "I don't know what that means".
119) 6) dialog: I intercepted phone calls.
119) 8) dialog: They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do. (driving through) Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic. (DEAN re-closes the gate) Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
119) 10) dialog: (driving again) Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan every phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
119) 12) dialog: That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
119) 14) dialog: It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to Ramparts and split.
119) 16) dialog: (shrugging it off) Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again. The pick-up stops by a long two-story warehouse.
119) 17) dialog: What do you think?
119) 19) dialog: Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
120) 0) text: BRILL and DEAN enter the 2nd story of a large, empty structure. DEAN is carrying a crumpled, brown paper bag. In the center of the cavernous space, a windowless, cinderblock room built on 5-foot supports.
120) 1) dialog: I call it the jar. No phone or utility lines going in. BRILL opens a side door revealing a mini-generator. He pushes the start button. The generator HUMS to life.
120) 2) dialog: Self-contained. Unplugged from the world. (opening Jar door) Nothing for a wire bug to piggy- back in on. That leaves only transmitters and signal sweep for those. (turning on the light) Now let's see what we got. DEAN tosses the paper bag to BRILL, who empties its contents (the pieces of the GameBoy) on to the table.
121) 0) text: DEAN sits alone, smoking a cigarette, and watching Norfolk rise from dawn's fog. In the distance we see BRILL coming down from the warehouse toward DEAN. He stands behind DEAN for a moment before...
121) 1) dialog: That is one ugly sunrise.
121) 3) dialog: Yeah. (beat) Take a walk with me. DEAN gets up and joins BRILL. The two of them start in the direction of the second warehouse.
121) 4) dialog: Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
121) 6) dialog: The NSA killed him.
121) 8) dialog: Well, actually, you have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
121) 10) dialog: They're here.
121) 12) dialog: Them.
121) 14) dialog: Here?
121) 16) dialog: In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
123) 0) text: DEAN and BRILL are kneeling beside the Chevy, letting the air out of the tires.
123) 1) dialog: Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
123) 4) dialog: They shouldn't have come without calling first. BRILL jumps into the Chevy, turns the key and the engine ignites. DEAN leaps in. BRILL stomps on the gas and tires screech. The Chevy hurtles through the warehouse toward a shut garage door. BRILL clicks a remote. The door rises. OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - The Chevy roars outward, screams around a corner, then speeds down a road lined with warehouses. DEAN looks down an intersecting road to glimpse a Saturn sedan gaining on a parallel road.
123) 5) dialog: Where's your gun? They pass an area with no warehouses. The Saturn turns, heading straight at them.
123) 8) dialog: You sure?
123) 10) dialog: Those are Feds.
123) 13) dialog: Think we let out enough air?
125) 0) text: DEAN and BRILL, windblown but alive, remove shards of glass. BRILL eyes the road behind him. Empty.
125) 1) dialog: We lost 'em.
125) 3) dialog: Fuckin-A.
125) 5) dialog: Yeah, I can see where that'd-- He stops talking. He hears ROTOR THUMPS as a black HELICOPTER appears over a fog-laced hillside, swooping down. BRILL floors it. The helicopter drops in closer as BRILL swerves back and forth while taking a curve at 70- plus on flapping tires. A helicopter SHARP-SHOOTER aims with an M-16. A spray of high-powered slugs suddenly rip into the Chevy's hood. The engine starts knocking.
125) 6) dialog: These guys are incredibly persistent.
127) 0) text: BRILL tries steering but metal wheels on concrete don't work. The car shimmies like it's on ice. Sparks fly as they bash into the tunnel wall, grinding to a stop.
128) 0) text: A GRUNGE-DUDE blasts his car-stereo as he enters the tunnel, unaware of the mayhem behind him. He slows, seeing a smoking wreck ahead. Closer, he sees DEAN waving him down. He slows more. Bad move. BRILL opens the rear door, leaps in, and points his pistol at the GRUNGE-DUDE's face. DEAN leaps in front.
128) 1) dialog: Drive.
128) 3) dialog: Drive.
128) 5) dialog: Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
128) 7) dialog: Goddammit--
128) 11) dialog: Drive the damn car! DEAN slides into the driver's seat, drops it in gear and goes. The Dodge erupts from the tunnel. Up ahead, the Saturn and another car approach fast in the opposite lane, speeding toward the tunnel's opening. The car's fly by, unaware of DEAN and BRILL passing in the Dodge. The Dodge continues on, fading into the fog.
131) 1) dialog: Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get near the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
131) 3) dialog: Same thing?
131) 5) dialog: I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
131) 7) dialog: It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?
132) 0) text: BRILL drives. DEAN thinks.
132) 2) dialog: The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be looking for those moves.
132) 4) dialog: I know. I know what they're looking for and I'm telling you. The car radio is playing a newscast...
132) 7) dialog: Have you seen how fuckin' slow the net is? It'd take ten minutes to unload enough video so that people know what they're seeing, and it'd take the NSA maybe 40 seconds to see it coming down and shut down the access.
132) 9) dialog: (reconsidering) But maybe if there were no phone line-- DEAN has started listening to the radio...
132) 10) dialog: What if we transmitted it over cellular?
132) 12) dialog: Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
132) 14) dialog: If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
132) 16) dialog: They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
132) 18) dialog: What if what?
132) 20) dialog: (pause) How?
132) 22) dialog: Reynolds.
132) 24) dialog: Who?
133) 0) text: BRILL educates DEAN on simple ways to alter one's appearance.
134) 0) text: A large auditorium. Preparations are being made for Senator Albert's upcoming speech. BRILL and DEAN casually case the area for vulnerabilities.
135) 1) dialog: You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
136) 2) dialog: How fast can you learn? Next to CHRISTA, looking conservative and altered in appearance, is DEAN, eavesdropping on the Senator's room numbers and any other pertinent info.
137) 2) dialog: We'll have to re-stock some basics.
138) 0) text: BRILL and DEAN go shopping.
138) 1) dialog: Bugs, frequency scanners, contact mics, transmitters, pin-holes, fiber optics--
139) 1) dialog: What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
139) 3) dialog: Shit.
140) 0) text: DEAN drives while BRILL sits with his open PC lap-top connect to his cellular phone.
140) 1) dialog: A 'modified' OKI 900 interfaced with a lap-top creates an enormously powerful tool. (referring to the cell-phone) I got into the software, did some code re-writing and turned it into one of the best scan-looking systems around. CLOSE ON SCREEN - A street map appears with positions of the network's relays. Lines appear indicating all in-progress cellular calls along with their locations.
140) 2) dialog: This is every call on the grid. I can lock and position any one I want and follow the hand-offs in real time. BRILL punches a number into the cellular and the phone locks on the signal. Through the lap-top, we hear RINGING and then an ANSWERING VOICE.
140) 5) dialog: (disconnecting) Need a place to stay for the weekend? A new TV? (BRILL has repeated the process)
140) 9) dialog: All from a hundred dollar scanner at Radio Shack. But it's time for business. BRILL dials his computer into a new line. TONES and COMMANDS fly quick as Brill's computer modems into anothe
140) 11) dialog: AmeriTech's data-base. (pointing on the screen) There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
140) 13) dialog: A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
144) 0) text: Numbered doors on each side. BRILL walks down the hall, hair slicked, mustache, wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase.
144) 1) dialog: The important thing about installations is numbers.
145) 2) dialog: They may find one, but they're not gonna find 'em all. --BRILL planting devices behind the headboard-- --Inside the telephone-- --Behind the desk-- --Inside the TV-- --BRILL rifling through CHRISTA's personal items, eyeing paper work, photographing interesting documents. --BRILL opening a connecting door, picking a second lock, and entering the adjoining suite.
148) 0) text: A phone distribution box is open, revealing a mass of circuit boards. BRILL stands at the box holding a circuit-dialer phone to his ear.
149) 2) dialog: (into sleeve mic) Got it. BRILL's phone line immediately rings. He waits...then answers.
149) 3) dialog: (into phone) Baudmore Consultants.
149) 5) dialog: Who's calling?
149) 7) dialog: Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
149) 9) dialog: My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
150) 0) text: CLOSE ON A FREQUENCY COUNTER sweeping a chest of drawers. The device starts BUZZING, indicating a transmitter. BRILL, disguised, is on hands and knees, searching under a chest where he 'discovers' a bug he planted earlier.
150) 1) dialog: (removing the transmitter) Oh yeah. Got another one here. BRILL shows it to PATRICK, a very embarrassed HOTEL MANAGER and a very serious HEAD OF HOTEL SECURITY.
150) 2) dialog: Nasty fella. A TX-703. Remote on- off, three-thousand foot range. Shit, you could listen from a shopping mall across the street.
151) 0) text: BRILL stands in front of SENATOR ALBERT.
151) 1) dialog: Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
151) 3) dialog: Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
151) 5) dialog: The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
151) 7) dialog: Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
151) 9) dialog: FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
151) 11) dialog: I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
151) 13) dialog: Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
151) 15) dialog: With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
151) 17) dialog: Anytime. PATRICK escorts BRILL out of the RV. The SENATOR, fuming, opens a book, looks up a phone number and punches it into his phone.
152) 0) text: A place packed with STUDENTS, computers and TEACHERS. DEAN sits in a corner reading a magazine, but what he's really watching is-- A WELL-DRESSED MAN at the counter, his back to DEAN, ordering a cup of coffee. The MAN glances at DEAN off the mirror behind the counter BRILL walks in and joins DEAN.
152) 1) dialog: Albert's primed. We'll let him stew for a day and then drop the tape. BRILL looks over at the WELL-DRESSED MAN.
152) 3) dialog: (pause) C'mon. They're about to start for the front door when an unmarked police car pulls up in front. A rowdy group of FRAT BOYS flood in, loud and busy. By the time they pass, BRILL and DEAN are gone. The WELL-DRESSED MAN scans the coffee shop and sees the back door swinging shut.
153) 0) text: DEAN and BRILL run down the street, through an alley and over a fence to another street. They slow as they approach the parked Taurus. BRILL takes the wheel with DEAN beside him. They pull into traffic. Things look good, but then the UNMARKED CAR and a SQUAD CAR scream up behind, lights flashing.
154) 0) text: BRILL dumps the car into low gear and the Taurus comes alive.
156) 0) text: Through alleys, down streets, under an overpass, down a one-way street, barely missing a head-on as they roar into a rail-yard traversing the waterfront. BRILL's at his best, putting distance between himself and the cops at every turn. Finally, it looks as if they've made it as they race down an alleyway, only to realize it's a dead-end. BRILL slams into reverse. They screech backward, tires smoking. Too late. The squad car rips into the alleyway, boxing them in. BRILL hits the brakes. He looks back at the dead-end and sees an empty flat-bed trailer with a ramp. BRILL gives it everything. If they can get enough speed and hit the ramp right, maybe they can clear the obstructing wall.
156) 1) dialog: Feeling lucky?
