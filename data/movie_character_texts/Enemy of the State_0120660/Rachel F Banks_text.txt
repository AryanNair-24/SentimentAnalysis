6) 1) dialog: How's the trout?
6) 3) dialog: It is fish.
6) 5) dialog: Do you like fish?
6) 7) dialog: Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
6) 9) dialog: DePinto?
6) 11) dialog: Never.
6) 13) dialog: What answer were you-- DEAN is reaching inside his jacket pocket. He removes an envelope marked "BRILL".
6) 15) dialog: It's how he works.
6) 17) dialog: Yes.
6) 20) dialog: I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
6) 22) dialog: Other than me.
6) 24) dialog: Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
6) 26) dialog: He doesn't work that way.
6) 28) dialog: You're not.
6) 30) dialog: I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
6) 32) dialog: Eat your fish.
7) 0) text: DEAN weaves his BMW through D.C. bumper-to-bumper traffic as he eyes the photos that Rachel gave him which are lying on the passenger seat. The photos show DePINTO sitting in a motel lounge with TWO MOB TYPES. He's talking on the phone.
62) 0) text: RACHEL cradles a portable phone to her ear.
62) 1) dialog: (into phone) I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
62) 3) dialog: There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The mob, Bobby!
65) 0) text: STACY stares blankly, eyes red. A copy of The Post is beside her. A picture of DEAN and RACHEL, arm in arm, accompanies a headline. DEAN walks in--
76) 0) text: Sunlight slashes blinds revealing a place that is wrong during the day. JIMMY, a beefy bartender, takes stock of the liquor while RACHEL sits in a dark booth.
76) 2) dialog: Good. You're just what I need right now.
76) 4) dialog: (getting up) It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
76) 6) dialog: I gotta go.
76) 9) dialog: No. No problem. (to DEAN) Outside.
77) 1) dialog: There's a lot of people asking questions about you and me. We drift down to the harbor walkway, a greenbelt with quaint hotels and bars on one side, Chesapeake Bay on the other. DEAN and RACHEL are strolling the walk.
77) 3) dialog: The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
77) 5) dialog: For the last four years.
77) 7) dialog: You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
77) 9) dialog: Bullshit.
77) 11) dialog: We're screwed.
77) 13) dialog: How?
78) 1) dialog: (through headphones) I can't.
78) 3) dialog: (through headphones) I've never met him?
79) 0) text: DEAN and RACHEL on their stroll--
79) 1) dialog: Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
79) 3) dialog: This conversation's over.
79) 5) dialog: I don't have a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
79) 7) dialog: What makes you think it's you?
79) 9) dialog: You're a moron, you know that?
79) 11) dialog: When I need to reach Brill, I chalk the mailbox on 14th and Main.
80) 0) text: RACHEL is walking to the mailbox. She casually slashes the box with chalk and drops a letter inside.
80) 1) dialog: When he sees the mark, he knows there's a drop. The location's always the same.
81) 1) dialog: The number twelve ferry to Glen Burnie. Tuesdays or Fridays.
82) 0) text: DEAN takes a seat. Across the deck is Seat 74. RACHEL takes the seat and casually slides an envelope behind it, her actions obscured by a bag she carries. The ferry BLOWS its departure horn.
82) 1) dialog: The drop's behind Seat 74. I leave something, he picks it up later. The ferry churns water. RACHEL moves to a wind protected seat, leaving Seat 74 empty. DEAN keeps watch on the seat as he scans the paper.
82) 3) dialog: My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's. A MONTAGE of different people occupying Seat 74. A middle-aged DRUNK passed out in the seat. A TEEN-AGED boy with glasses chats with friends.
82) 4) dialog: Race, height, weight, you're on your own. An OLD LADY reads a book. She sees DEAN eyeing her and smiles nervously. DEAN returns to his paper.
82) 5) dialog: Now I don't know how he's gonna feel about someone tracking him down. He's reclusive. I'm sure he has his reasons. DEAN's alone now. The ferry docks for the night. The last passengers, TWO NUNS, disembark. DEAN rises to go. Brill's a no-show.
89) 0) text: STACY is at the desk looking at the latest edition of the paper, which now has a photograph of DEAN and RACHEL walking in the park from the day before. The phone rings and STACY reaches for it...
