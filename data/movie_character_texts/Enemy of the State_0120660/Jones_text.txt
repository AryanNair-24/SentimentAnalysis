21) 10) dialog: Not without a signature.
94) 2) dialog: (disturbingly calm) Open the door, Mr. Dean. There's nowhere to go. We'd just like to talk. Seeing a phone, DEAN grabs it. No tone. Just a RECORDING of Nancy Sinatra's song "These Boots are Made for Walking".
94) 3) dialog: It'd be easier for all of us if you just come out. Nothing'll happen. DEAN heaves a coffee table up on the desk.
94) 4) dialog: It's quite hopeless what you're doing, Mr. Dean.
94) 6) dialog: (chuckling) I think you might be over-reacting there, Mr. Dean. We just want to talk.

99) 0) text: DEAN huddles in the back car, panic-breathing, as PRATT and JONES move through the cars searching for faces. DEAN looks for an out. He sees an emergency stop handle. He YANKS it forward. PASSENGERS yell. The brakes lock and SCREECH. The train slows. Then stops. DEAN opens the door. And jumps. He looks around. Just black curved track in either direction. He starts running. Then he hears it. The horrible SCREECHING of an approaching train. Trapped. On one side, the train he left. On the other, a wall. He runs down the track with all that's left. PRATT and JONES reach the open door and see the oncoming train bearing down on DEAN. They duck in as the train SWISHES by. DEAN lays flat between the tracks, his face kissing greasy ground as the train screeches over him. Tons of angry steel are teasing his shirt fabric. Then it's over. The train's gone. DEAN's alive. He gets up to see PRATT and JONES leap to the tracks.

156) 7) dialog: Thank you. KRUG draws his silenced pistol and matter of factly shoots the COP dead.
156) 8) dialog: (to KRUG) Check inside. DEAN is watching this all unseen, helplessly trying to dig himself out of the coal. KRUG inspects the Taurus interior for anything of interest. JONES scans the area.
156) 11) dialog: (scrambling away) Fuck-- JONES wipes prints off his pistol and silencer and tosses it into the flames as the police cars approach. DEAN watches from the shadows as flames incinerate everything.
172) 0) text: HICKS, JONES and DAVIS prepare. All have miniature earphones. DAVIS checks his silenced pistol. HICKS activates a frequency locator. The needle snaps on. He looks at DAVIS and JONES. They're ready. All hand signals, no words, as the trio ascend the staircase. One flight, two. Then HICKS stops. The needle says they're close. HICKS motions. Their target's on two. They move down the hall - silent except for a creaking floor and a TV SHOW drifting from an apartment.  Someone's up at this hour. They move on. HICKS watches the needle as it moves. He motions DAVIS and JONES to a door. JONES puts a reverse-viewer against the peep-hole. JONES's POV: A view of an entryway and living room. A light bleeds from an O.S. source. Beyond that there's no sign of life. HICKS puts a contact-mic against the door and listens to FAINT CONVERSATION somewhere inside, possibly the phone call. HICKS nods to JONES who quickly picks the lock while DAVIS eyes the hall. After a nervous moment, the door opens and HICKS, JONES and DAVIS enter.
