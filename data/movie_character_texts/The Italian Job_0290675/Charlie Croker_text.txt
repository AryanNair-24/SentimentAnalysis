Using crowbars they pull apart the plywood. The cardboard boxes of tomatoes dump out, tomatoes spilling everywhere. And now we see what was hidden between the boxes... A large safe. They move like clock-work. Half-Ear aims an underwater li at the dial. Charlie drills a small hole near the dial. John peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three whee of the combination lock... until the door pops open. As they stare at what's inside, they speak into their  headsets, heard by all.

33) 1) dialog: If you would have told me that I  would spend the next three years  searching for Steve Bandell, I would  have said that was nothing. Cause I  would have spent a lifetime looking  for that bastard if I had to.
37) 13) dialog: Hi, Stella.
37) 16) dialog: Yeah. You did.
37) 18) dialog: I found him.

37) 31) dialog: I tracked Steve down to an address  in the Hollywood Hills. He's changed  his last name to Frezelli. And get  this: he had a Worthington 1000  installed in the house before he  even moved in. We both know that you  don't install a Worthington 1000  unless you have something precious  to guard.
37) 33) dialog: We boosted that gold from a terrorist  group that was about to trade it for  bio-weapons. Now that doesn't exactly  make us Robin Hood, but maybe in our  own little way we were doing a good  deed. Problem is, no one in my crew  can handle that safe. And I need  someone I can trust.
37) 35) dialog: What I heard is that you have your  father's touch. And he was the only  safecracker I knew who could open a  Worthington 1000.
37) 37) dialog: You're John Bridger's daughter. And  this is our chance to set things  right.

39) 21) dialog: What do you mean? I come here all  the time.
39) 23) dialog: Sure. Lawyers, Judges, my kind of  crowd. See that gentleman there, he  sentenced me to 90 days in county  once. We need to talk.
39) 25) dialog: Hey, I paid valet parking prices to  get in here, not to mention a twenty  spot to the busboy to spill that  drink on Mister Zipper.
39) 27) dialog: Actually, you paid for it.
39) 28) text: Charlie returns her wallet.
39) 29) dialog: Didn't notice it was me who bumped  into you earlier, did you? Anyway, I  was hoping we could get to know each  other a little better before we leave  for Los Angeles. I already booked  your flight.

39) 33) dialog: Charlie --
39) 36) dialog: I'm beginning to worry about this  whole relationship.
39) 38) text: Charlie looks away, lets her have her point. This whole t is getting pretty heated so when he turns back to her, he uses a whole new approach. His emotions are genuine.
39) 39) dialog: John wasn't just a man I crewed up  with, he was my friend, he was the  closest thing to a father I ever  had. I wish to God I could bring him  back. But all I can do is go after  this guy, the guy that killed him,  and hit him where he lives.
39) 44) text: But for now, Charlie is just staring at Richard, boring i to him...
39) 46) dialog: Oh, sorry. I was just undressing you  with my eyes.
