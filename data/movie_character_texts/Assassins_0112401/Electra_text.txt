39) 0) text: The apartment is always dark; heavy drapes cover the windows. The dining and living rooms look like the control booth o a network television show, stacks of video monitors and consoles, cables, electric wiring, coils of fiber optic cord duct-taped to the floors, walls and ceilings.  They snake through holes punched in the plaster walls and hang everywhere like some technological jungle. At the center of this tangled web is ELECTRA, a beautiful athletic looking woman wearing only her underwear and a worn robe.  She is curled up in an overstuffed chair, a bowl of popcorn in her lap. On the monitors, she is watching what at first might be mistaken for a soap opera; a young couple are having an argument. What is strange is that the angle never changes; a fish- eye lens staring down into the room.
39) 4) dialog: Jerk. Jennifer is too stunned to say anything.  There is a long pause that is not at all like television.  It seems very real. She starts to say something, but stops, trying to keep herself from crying.
39) 7) dialog: Mmm, smell that, Nikita? Nikita, Electra's black cat, is stretched lazily across the top of a chair, her tail twitching absently.  Every corner of the chair has been clawed open. Electra reaches for the control board and throws a series of switches. The monitors flicker as the image changes.  We are now looking down into a kitchen.  A stove is beneath us, almost like a cooking show, where a round woman is taking out a tray of chocolate chip cookies. Electra smells them again, smiling as she inhales.
39) 8) dialog: I hope she saves some for us. There is a BANG, a DOOR SLAMMING in another apartment, an a MAN YELLING. Electra switches back to Jennifer's apartment. The man is still in the living room, but Jennifer is gone
40) 0) text: Electra's front door opens slowly.  Timidly, she steps ou of her apartment and walks down the hall until she is standing in front of Jennifer's door. She starts to knock, but stops herself.  She isn't sure she should do this. She paces, then turns to the door. She knocks, so softly it's almost impossible to hear. She stands, trying to force herself to knock again, when she hears Jennifer.
41) 0) text: On the monitors, Electra watches Jennifer pick up the phone.
41) 2) dialog: Crap.
42) 0) text: There is a system set up that is not unlike Rath's system all of the same components, though the equipment is bigger, more powerful and less portable. On a table there is a bank of phones, several cellular. Electra is talking on one.
42) 2) dialog: I wasn't watching television.
42) 4) dialog: I thought it was interesting --
42) 6) dialog: Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
42) 8) dialog: I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
42) 10) dialog: A pleasure doing business with you. She hangs up.
43) 0) text: Electra comes down the stairs. Outside the large glass door she sees KEN, Jennifer's boyfriend, leaving. On the lobby floor is a letter, apparently slipped under the door, addressed to Jennifer Morgan. Electra looks out the front door window, making sure that Ken is gone. She picks up the letter and stuffs it into her pocket.
49) 2) dialog: I trust your flight was comfortable?
49) 4) dialog: Tell the driver:  the Hyatt Hotel.
50) 0) text: Electra is pacing, talking into the cellular phone.
50) 1) dialog: I'll call you again in twenty minutes. She punches a button and shoves the antennae down. The hotel room looks like her apartment.  There is a computer and a series of monitors stacked on top of the wood laminate desk.  Cables whip and wind across the carpeted floor to the central air duct. The panel has been removed and intertwined black and gray coaxial run up inside the duct. Immediately, Electra is busy finishing her preparations. She snaps in several power cords and the system comes on- line. On the monitor screen, we see an empty hotel room that looks exactly like the one she is in.
52) 0) text: Laying on the bed, in a patch of sunlight, Nikita watches Electra rush about. Electra grabs the sheet from under the comforter and yank it out.
52) 1) dialog: Excuse me, your Highness. Nikita casually walks off the bed. Electra takes the sheet to the open duct and tears off a long piece of duct-tape.
54) 0) text: Electra checks her watch and picks up the cellular phone.
56) 0) text: Electra is pacing again.
56) 1) dialog: Room 1414.
59) 0) text: Electra continues to pace, checking the monitors.
63) 0) text: When the Japanese men enter the suite, we realize that this is the image on Electra's monitors.  Surveillance camcorders and microphones are mounted in various locations to display every inch of the room.  The group hesitates for a moment, under the electronic eyes. The four goons have their hands in their jackets. A small LAPTOP COMPUTER sits on the coffee table HUMMING SOFTLY.  It is the only noise in the room until a speaker crackles.
65) 0) text: Electra stands in front of the monitors watching the men as she speaks into the microphone.
65) 1) dialog: Ten thousand dollars per disk. Insert the first disk now. On the monitor, we see Akira at the coffee table shove th first disk into the laptop disk drive.
68) 0) text: Electra is crouched at the open duct, grabbing another stack of money, stuffing it into her bag. A LOUD BANG EXPLODES out of the SPEAKERS and she looks up at the monitor.
70) 0) text: Electra stares in horror at the monitors as Bain grabs th nearest bodyguard, FIRING a SHOT into his belly.
70) 1) dialog: Oh, God.
72) 0) text: Electra leaps at the computer, ripping the cord from the modem. Bain sees the fiber optic cable and looks right into it.
73) 0) text: Electra explodes through the door and suddenly freezes. She is staring down the barrel of Rath's .22.
74) 0) text: Electra's black CAR ROARS out of the garage, onto the ope street.
75) 0) text: The door swings open.  From the hall we can hear the familiar BEEPING of the COMPUTER GAME.  The room, 1014, i the same as Electra had left it when she ran out. Jutting from a shadow on the floor is the corner of Ken's letter.
76) 0) text: Electra drives, obviously nervous, as Rath watches out th rear window.
76) 3) dialog: What?
76) 5) dialog: Um, five.
78) 2) dialog: Where are we going? Rath glances back.
78) 4) dialog: Nikita, hush. NIKITA wants out and HOWLS again.
78) 5) dialog: She won't stop unless you let her out. Rath reaches back and opens the box.  Nikita springs into the front seat onto Rath's lap.
78) 7) dialog: What?  How did you know I had a cat?
78) 9) dialog: Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
78) 11) dialog: Yeah? She studies his face, his eyes.
78) 12) dialog: Bullshit.
78) 14) dialog: You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
78) 16) dialog: Jesus! He reaches into the back seat, grabbing her bag.
78) 17) dialog: What do you think you're doing? Rath plucks out the bundles of money.
78) 19) dialog: What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
78) 23) dialog: Ten million --
80) 1) dialog: Now what?
80) 3) dialog: You want me to pump?
80) 5) dialog: Okay, Nikita, stay calm, think, breathe, think... Electra checks the rear view mirror, listening as Rath pumps the gas.  Her eyes flash down to her bag. Outside, Rath watches Electra through the windows.  She appears motionless. The electric gas counter races like a stop watch. In the car, Electra eases her hand into her bag. The tank full, Rath re-hangs the pump.  He walks around the car and heads for the station. Electra waits until his back is turned.  She pulls her tool pouch from her bag, throws it open and finds her wir stripper.  Reaching under the dash, she yanks out a tangled handful of wire. She looks up; Rath is inside paying.
80) 6) dialog: Come on, come on, it's a cake walk. Her fingers fly with surgical precision, snipping, stripping, twisting. Rath steps out of the station as her head pops up, lookin for him.  It takes only a second for him to realize what she is doing.
80) 8) dialog: Please, please. He is almost there when the ENGINE FIRES.  She stomps on the gas, ramming the shift into drive. TIRES SQUEALING, the car swerves forward as Rath slams into it.  He bounces backward, falling to the ground. The car fishtails away, accelerating as Rath rolls to one knee, his gun automatically in his hand.  He draws a bead but, he does not shoot. With a concerted effort, he puts the gun away.
81) 0) text: Electra's car is parked out front. She unlocks the lobby door and drags herself inside.
82) 0) text: Standing at the mailboxes flipping through her mail is Jennifer Morgan.  What she was hoping for is not there. She looks up and sees Electra.
82) 4) dialog: Letter?
82) 6) dialog: No.  I don't have it. Electra's mouth opens and she backs away.  Jennifer is bothered by her reaction and she doesn't push it.
83) 0) text: Electra climbs the stairs, her mind pouring through the possibilities, filled with fear. By the time Electra reaches the top floor, Jennifer is entering her apartment. Electra hurries past Jennifer's door to her own.
84) 0) text: Electra flies across the living room to the monitors. She clicks them on, putting on Jennifer's channel. On the screen we see Jennifer in her living room checking her phone messages.  One from her mother. Electra throws a few switches so that Jennifer's entire apartment is in front of her. On one of the monitors we see a shadow slide across the oak floor as something moves along the edge of the room. Jennifer has moved to the bathroom and is drawing a bath. Electra clamps her hand over her mouth when he steps out. Bain moves into the dining room where Jennifer had just been. Wearing rubber surgeon's gloves, he picks up the mail tha she had dropped on the table and sorts through it. Bain moves about the apartment with complete indifference to Jennifer's presence; as if he were invisible, as thoug he knew she couldn't see him. He moves into a room, just as she moves out. Electra watches, dizzy, sick with terror, but she is unable to turn away. Bain searches through a desk drawer, while Jennifer start undressing for her bath. He walks down the hall and stands outside of the bathroom If Jennifer would turn around she would see him. Electra is about to run, to call out when -- Something catches Bain's eye. He moves into the bedroom, and is turned so that he is looking straight up into the camera. He inches towards it, not sure what it is.  The fiber optic cable is hidden in the light fixture hanging over the bed. Staring at it, he is looking right at Electra. Bain steps up onto the bed, his face distorting as he moves close to the fish-eye lens.  Poking it with his finger, he realizes what it is.  A warped smile stretches across his face as he whispers --
85) 0) text: The door opens and Electra jumps out, slamming it behind her as -- Bain turns from the back stairs. She leaps back inside as he whips out his GUN, PUMPING TW HOLES in the door.
86) 0) text: She scrambles from the kitchen, throwing her suitcase, still clutching the "travel kitty," as -- The back DOOR EXPLODES from its hinges, Bain charging, FIRING his GUN. BULLETS HISSING past her, Electra crashes through the front door into the hall.
87) 0) text: The stairs are at the far end.  She is only halfway, when -- Rath rises up the stairs, his gun cocked. Electra drops to the floor as -- Behind her, Bain barrels from the apartment. Rath FIRES. The wood DOOR SPLINTERS, BULLET HOLES surrounding Bain. Off balance, he lunges back into the apartment. Rath continues FIRING, grabbing hold of Electra. They run down the stairs.
91) 0) text: Electra and Rath enter the room together but they are bot immediately alone. She walks across the room to a chair in the corner, curling into it even as Nikita jumps up and curls into he lap. He sets his briefcase on the table at the opposite end of the room and sits. They watch each other.  Silence. Between then is the liquor cabinet.  Rath knows a good idea when he sees one.
91) 9) dialog: Shut up! He freezes, bottle in one hand, glass in the other.
91) 10) dialog: Stop trying to tell me what I'm thinking! She moves closer to him, the gun squeezed in her fist.
91) 11) dialog: I'll tell you what you're thinking -- you think I'm not going to shoot you but right now you're not so sure, are you? A slight shake of the head, no.
91) 12) dialog: You're thinking that maybe it was a mistake to give me this gun, that maybe I'm not going to think about things logically because I'm a woman and I'm freaked out and I'm going to do something impulsive and irrational -- right? She FIRES the GUN to both sides of his head.  He's surprised to be alive.
91) 13) dialog: You don't know shit about me!  Now sit down! He returns to his chair and sits with the same expression she had worn sitting a moment ago. She opens the cabinet and grabs one of the sample bottles of liquor.  She sucks it all down and throws the bottle across the room. Grabbing another, she sits on the edge of the bed.
91) 14) dialog: Okay.  How did you find me?
91) 16) dialog: You didn't know anything about me. Nikita rubs up against her leg.
91) 17) dialog: Nikita?
91) 19) dialog: You're one of them, aren't you?
91) 21) dialog: An assassin?
91) 23) dialog: What does that mean?
91) 25) dialog: Who is that other guy?
91) 27) dialog: Someone hired both of you?
91) 29) dialog: So this is something between you and him?
91) 31) dialog: Why?
91) 33) dialog: He wants to kill you?
91) 35) dialog: Why?
91) 37) dialog: And you want to use me to get him?
91) 39) dialog: Forget it!
91) 41) dialog: Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
91) 43) dialog: I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
91) 45) dialog: I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
91) 47) dialog: I don't need the money.
91) 49) dialog: Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
91) 51) dialog: Why?
91) 53) dialog: You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
91) 56) dialog: How?
91) 58) dialog: Oh Jesus Jesus...
91) 60) dialog: Shut up!  All right!  You've said enough! She forces herself back, grabbing handfuls of the sample bottles.
91) 61) dialog: I need to think... To be alone. With the gun and an armful of booze and Nikita following at her feet, she goes into the bathroom and slams the door.
93) 0) text: Very mechanically, Rath begins setting up his chess board putting the pieces into the same positions.  It is a ritual, and with it he enters a kind of trance. From the bathroom, almost inaudible, he hears Electra CRYING.
95) 0) text: Rath stares at the board.  The CRYING grows LOUDER.  He stands and walks to the door.  He starts to knock but stops himself. Like Electra with Jennifer, Rath would like to help, he just has no idea how to.  He turns back to the desk, to his chess game.
96) 1) dialog: Oh shit, Nikita.
98) 1) dialog: Cheers. Electra finishes another sample and drops it to the floor where we see that many of the bottles are now empty. In the tub, steam rising off the surface, she wrings out wash cloth and covers her face, sinking deeper into the water.
99) 0) text: When Electra comes out of the bathroom, Rath is again at his chess game.  She sits down across from him and sets the gun on the table between them. Rath looks up at her.
99) 1) dialog: Listen -- I don't even know your name.
99) 3) dialog: Electra.
99) 5) dialog: Yeah.
99) 7) dialog: No.  Just Electra. The conversation dies.
99) 8) dialog: What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
99) 10) dialog: If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have? He stares at her.
99) 12) dialog: Why?
99) 14) dialog: This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other? They sit in silence, the gun and the chess game lying between them.
99) 16) dialog: With computers.
99) 18) dialog: Better than playing with yourself. He smiles.
99) 20) dialog: Had?
99) 22) dialog: He was white? Rath nods.
99) 23) dialog: It looks like white's game.
99) 25) dialog: Why didn't you finish this game? She reaches over and lifts a White Knight and takes a Bishop.  Rath counters, taking her Knight.
99) 27) dialog: He was killed. Rath nods. Throughout the entire conversation they continue to play out the chess game.
99) 28) dialog: By who? A long beat.
99) 30) dialog: Why?
99) 32) dialog: Where you wanted to be?
99) 34) dialog: How did you get into the business?
99) 36) dialog: The C.I.A.?
99) 38) dialog: How old were you?
99) 40) dialog: Jesus -- why?
99) 42) dialog: You were like a boy genius?
99) 44) dialog: Why not?
99) 46) dialog: You went from high school to the Agency?
99) 48) dialog: They didn't give you a choice, did they?
99) 50) dialog: But you knew what they were training you for?
99) 52) dialog: Ahhhh...
99) 54) dialog: The exotic women.
99) 56) dialog: Why not?
99) 58) dialog: Why?
99) 60) dialog: Why did you leave the Agency?
99) 62) dialog: They tried to kill you?
99) 64) dialog: Then you went freelance?
99) 66) dialog: Tell me about the first time.
99) 68) dialog: Yes.
99) 70) dialog: Because I want to know.
99) 72) dialog: Are they usually like that?
99) 74) dialog: After that?
99) 76) dialog: Did it ever bother you?
99) 78) dialog: That's fiction.
99) 80) dialog: Does that mean it didn't bother you? Rath leans back and stares at her.  She waits.
99) 84) dialog: No.  Something honest. A beat.  Rath likes this woman. She moves her Queen.
99) 85) dialog: Mate. He smiles.
99) 86) dialog: I hope your plan is better than your game.
101) 2) dialog: Three days? We are in Electra and Rath's hotel room.  She is standing behind him, reading as he types.
101) 4) dialog: Are you going to tell him?
101) 6) dialog: You said you didn't trust it.
101) 9) dialog: What kind of bank is going to allow us to withdraw ten million dollars the day it is transferred?
101) 12) dialog: Several.
101) 14) dialog: Where is it?
102) 0) text: Rath and Electra are sitting in the first class section, which she is obviously enjoying, smiling and sipping champagne.
102) 1) dialog: God, I love first class.  I remember when I was a little girl, I would wonder what it was like up here.  I would always try to peek through the curtains. Rath says nothing, staring out the window. Electra shakes her head.
102) 2) dialog: I hope Nikita's all right. He still does not respond.
102) 3) dialog: Hey, where are you?
102) 5) dialog: About?
102) 7) dialog: I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
102) 9) dialog: You were there? A long beat.
104) 0) text: Rath and Electra hand their bags to a CABBY who puts them in his trunk.
107) 0) text: American tourist dollars have built up the coasts, but much of the out-lying city is very poor. The old Hotel Paraiso is a five story blackened husk.  Th face of the building is burnt black and it seems to hang in space as something non-corporeal, like the shadow of the building rather than the building itself. Rath stares at it, remembering. Electra is behind him, standing in the midst of the Plaza del Sol. He looks up to the fifth story window, then turns directl opposite of that. The International Banco de Mexico, an enormous, beautiful old building; its exterior walls are white-washed concrete, blindingly bright white. Electra looks at the bank and smiles.
107) 1) dialog: So, that's where all that S &amp; L money is? Rath is not listening to her.  He is somewhere else.  He turns back to the fourth story window.
107) 3) dialog: What?
109) 0) text: On one side of the elevator is a young couple who look like newlyweds.  They are cuddling, kissing and giggling as though they are alone. Electra and Rath are on the other side of the elevator. It is a strange contrast. Electra is staring at them. Rath, behind his sunglasses, is in his own world. The ELEVATOR CHIMES and opens. Nobody moves. The DOORS CHIME again and start to close, as everyone realizes that this is their floor. Rath and the other man grab the doors, which spring back open. It is a funny, awkward moment, as everyone apologizes and smiles politely, on the way out.
110) 0) text: The couple move down the hall, the newlyweds finding thei door first. Rath reaches the door to their room, opens it and enters. Electra lingers, watching the other couple, watching as h fumbles for his keys, her hand running up between his leg and over his ass. He finally manages to open the door and she pushes him inside. Electra softly closes her door.
111) 1) dialog: Did you see them? Electra moves about the large suite.
111) 2) dialog: They looked like they were in love. Rath says nothing.
111) 3) dialog: Well, I think I'll take a bath. Come on, Nikita! The two of them walk into the bathroom, leaving Rath to himself.
112) 0) text: Electra sits on the edge of the over-sized tub, water running through her fingers as she adjusts the temperature. After a beat she hears a SMALL CRASH, a GLASS BREAKING. It is followed by other MUFFLED NOISES, a WOMAN GIGGLING and a THUMPING.  The sounds are coming from the other sid of the tub wall, from the other suite.  Electra puts her ear against the tile to listen. The WATER FILLING her TUB is too loud for her to hear. She turns it OFF. There is more BUMPING and THUMPING, the WOMAN LAUGHING an then, the LAUGHS SHORTEN into SOFT WHIMPERS. Electra hangs on each sound, slowly lifted by it, moving up toward the over-head fan and ducts. The SOUNDS get LOUDER as she moves closer to the vents, until she is standing precariously on the edge of the tub listening to what is clearly the sounds of TWO PEOPLE MAKING LOVE. Their MOANS and SHRIEKS CLIMAX and Electra smiles.
113) 0) text: It is dark now.  A single desk light is on, under which Rath is setting up his chess board, putting the pieces in their familiar pattern. Electra comes out of the bathroom.  She seems very clean and fresh, wearing a long white T-shirt and thin robe.
113) 1) dialog: That felt great.  You should try it. She watches him setting the pieces onto the board.
113) 2) dialog: Don't you ever get tired of playing the same game? He looks at her.
113) 4) dialog: Why not?
113) 6) dialog: Oh.  What do you think about?
113) 8) dialog: Do you think about the game?
113) 10) dialog: But you've never figured out a way to win.
113) 12) dialog: Not even a stalemate?
113) 14) dialog: What happens if you do? This strikes Rath as a very strange question and he is suddenly annoyed by her.
113) 15) dialog: Can I ask you something? He knows she will anyway.
113) 16) dialog: What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
113) 18) dialog: That sounds nice. He finishes his glass of bourbon. She is not sure what to say next, if she should say anything at all.
113) 19) dialog: I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
113) 21) dialog: Thanks. She slips out of the robe and in between the sheets. Rath sits across the room, his back to her. She tries to make herself comfortable, but cannot.
113) 22) dialog: Do you think he's here?
113) 24) dialog: In Costa Blanca.
113) 26) dialog: What do you think he's doing?
115) 0) text: Electra leans out over the railing, smiling, inhaling the warm air, the scent of the shimmering blue-green sea. Rath stands in the shadow of the door frame.
115) 2) dialog: Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here. Rath steps a little farther out.  He looks down either side of the building, checking sight lines.  He looks out and sees another hotel with windows facing them. He turns to her.  Says nothing.  Moves back inside.
116) 0) text: The breakfast trays are empty.  Rath is sipping coffee, scribbling notes and diagrams on a piece of paper. Electra comes out of the bathroom dressed for the beach. He stops working.
116) 1) dialog: I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
116) 3) dialog: Really?
116) 5) dialog: Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.
117) 0) text: Electra steps out of the hotel room ready for the beach. At the end of the hall, she sees the newlywed couple get on the elevator.  She starts to call to them to hold it for her, but she stops herself. The elevator closes. She edges slowly down the hall, stopping outside the door to their suite.  She touches it with the tips of her fingers.
120) 0) text: Rath is leaning back in the bed, NIKITA PURRING in his lap. He did not sleep last night and is very tired.  His eyes fight to stay open. The sound of the TELEVISION momentarily hangs in the hote room as he sleeps.  The program is a SPANISH DUBBED version of GOLDFINGER. The door bangs open and Rath springs off the bed, a gun flashing in his hand, leveling it at a dazed, blinking Electra. Rath sighs slowly, letting the hammer of the GUN CLICK back into place.
120) 2) dialog: Sorry.
120) 4) dialog: The beach?  It was nice. She smiles.
122) 0) text: Electra is sitting on the bed, her back against the wall. In her hands is a paperback romance novel that she is looking over the top of, staring intensely across the room. We can hear Rath, his breathing deep and even.  He is doing Tai Chi, wearing only his boxer shorts.  His body i coated in a sheen of sweat, his muscles strained as he moves fluidly through space. Electra begins to breath with him. She moves her body slightly, her hips rising as though to meet his. He empties his lungs entirely in one exhale and stops, hi eyes closed, rested.
122) 1) dialog: That was beautiful. He looks at her.
122) 2) dialog: Tai Chi, right? He nods.
122) 3) dialog: Where did you learn it?
122) 5) dialog: Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
122) 7) dialog: I've always wanted to learn something like that.
124) 5) dialog: Oh, my God.  Ten million dollars.
124) 10) dialog: Two way?
124) 12) dialog: Cheap as shit. He looks at her.
124) 14) dialog: They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
124) 16) dialog: Fine. He goes back to his drawing.
124) 18) dialog: Check.
124) 20) dialog: But he won't shoot you right then?
124) 23) dialog: Okay.  Then what?
124) 25) dialog: Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
124) 28) dialog: Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
124) 30) dialog: What?  What if he brings it with him? He shakes his head.
124) 32) dialog: That means you won't have a gun.
124) 34) dialog: And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
124) 36) dialog: You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
124) 38) dialog: We split the money?
124) 40) dialog: Sounds pretty well figured out.
124) 42) dialog: Except --
124) 44) dialog: Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
124) 46) dialog: You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
124) 49) dialog: For Nicholai?
124) 51) dialog: You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank? Rath nods.
124) 52) dialog: What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
124) 54) dialog: I don't believe that.
124) 56) dialog: Ten years ago.
124) 58) dialog: What happened?
124) 60) dialog: What did he want?
124) 64) dialog: Was that it?
124) 66) dialog: You didn't take it.
124) 68) dialog: Ten years later, here you are again.
126) 0) text: Electra is still at the table, staring at the diagrams, i another world. Rath pours a glass of bourbon and sets it in front of her
126) 1) dialog: This has been the longest day of my life. Rath nods, pouring himself a drink.  Electra looks at the drink, downs the whole glass.  He refills it.
126) 2) dialog: Do you have ulcers?
126) 4) dialog: I think I got one today.
126) 6) dialog: What do you suppose he's doing now? Rath shrugs.  He is no longer looking at her; staring at the board, moving his mind into the chess game. She watches him and then begins to study it with him, the way a child does, almost imitating him.  She does not wan to be left alone right now. She reaches over and moves a white knight. He blinks.  His eyes shifting, sorting the possibilities. He picks a bishop and counters. After another sequence, he takes her bishop and she takes his knight.
126) 8) dialog: I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
126) 10) dialog: So? There is no point in arguing. As they continue to play, we begin to hear in the distance, the COUPLE in the adjoining suite MAKING very vigorous LOVE. Electra watches Rath to see if he hears them.  He shows n sign of it, concentrating on the game.
126) 11) dialog: Do you hear them? He looks up.
126) 12) dialog: Listen. He hears it.  Not interested.
126) 13) dialog: Did you think they were newlyweds?
126) 15) dialog: When I first saw them I thought they were married.
126) 17) dialog: I went into their room this afternoon.
126) 19) dialog: It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
126) 21) dialog: Nobody ever sees me.   
126) 23) dialog: I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did. Rath shakes his head.  In the b.g., the WOMAN is ALMOST SCREAMING.
126) 24) dialog: She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
126) 26) dialog: Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
126) 28) dialog: No?
126) 30) dialog: I know.  It makes me crazy.
126) 32) dialog: I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
126) 34) dialog: So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
126) 36) dialog: He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
126) 38) dialog: He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole. The WOMAN SCREAMS a final time in CLIMAX. Electra moves her queen, taking his other knight.
126) 40) dialog: What?
126) 42) dialog: Why?
126) 44) dialog: I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way. He shrugs and takes her queen, the game continuing.
126) 45) dialog: Can I ask you something?
126) 47) dialog: Am I attractive? This gets his attention.
126) 49) dialog: Are you attracted to me?
126) 51) dialog: Why?
126) 53) dialog: Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
126) 55) dialog: Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
126) 57) dialog: Attraction is a complication?
126) 59) dialog: It happened to you before?
126) 61) dialog: Who was she?
126) 63) dialog: What happened to her?
126) 65) dialog: Did you --
126) 67) dialog: Was she the only one?
126) 69) dialog: Is this becoming complicated?
126) 71) dialog: Were you attracted to me right away?
126) 73) dialog: When did it start?
126) 75) dialog: Uh-huh.
126) 77) dialog: Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
126) 79) dialog: That doesn't sound normal.
126) 81) dialog: I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you. They rise up from the table, together, knocking over the chess game.  The pieces fall to the floor. They grab at each other, kissing, both of them hungry, aggressive.  They tear at each other's clothes and at their own clothes; it has a very awkward sense to it, as they become naked in front of each other.  There is nothing smooth or fluid about it, which makes it seem ver real. He takes her, lifting her onto the table. She scoots and wiggles back, the chess pieces falling out of the way. She opens her legs and he moves in between them.
126) 82) dialog: I wanted to tell you -- Her breath rushes out, then back in.
126) 83) dialog: My real name is Anna. He smiles.
126) 85) dialog: Martin. Her legs wrap up around his hips and he pushes deeper int her.
126) 86) dialog: Nice to meet you, Martin.
130) 0) text: The cafe is off the plaza. Electra sits at a patio table.  Down the street she can see the back of the burned-out hotel. She hears Rath in her ear-piece.

136) 0) text: Electra watches as Bain moves along the plywood wall, covered with bills and posters, built to keep people out of the burned hotel.  He is carrying a long nylon duffel bag. At the corner, a section of the plywood has been pulled loose and Bain squeezes through, into the hotel.
136) 1) dialog: He's inside.
142) 0) text: Electra is sipping at some iced tea, dizzy at the thought of all that money.
142) 1) dialog: Ten million dollars, sitting there. Waiting... this is insane.
148) 0) text: Electra is watching the back of the hotel, when Bain emerges from the shadows.
148) 1) dialog: Oh my God. He is moving like a bullet, knocking into people who don' get out of his way.
148) 2) dialog: He's coming.
149) 2) dialog: What?
149) 4) dialog: Shit.

152) 0) text: Electra carefully moves up to the fifth floor, then navigates around a large hole, towards the last room.
154) 0) text: Inside the burned out closet, Electra finds Bain's nylon duffel bag. Digging through it, she finds his Gameboy, his Walkman, his .22, ammunition clips and several issues of Soldier o Fortune and a Punisher comic book. The rifle is not here.

163) 1) dialog: It wasn't with his other stuff!
166) 0) text: Electra looks up and there is the gun; supported by black plumbing pipe and charred lathe.  It hangs in the space between two joists, hidden in the upstairs floor.
166) 2) dialog: Oh, God.  I see it! She reaches for it, but it's too high.
168) 0) text: Electra peeks over the rail to see Bain right behind her.
170) 0) text: Electra turns into the hotel room just as Bain reaches th fifth floor.  There is no time.

172) 4) text: Electra slowly rises, still watching Bain.
