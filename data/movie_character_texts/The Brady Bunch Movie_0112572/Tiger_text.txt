In addition to the usual Brady objects in the backyard, the yard is cluttered with remnants of various episodes; a teeter-totter, Greg's surfboard, a club house, and, of course, Tiger’s doghouse. TIGER, who had been lost after the first-season’s episodes, has found his way back home for this film. One major addition has been made to the backyard. It’s a practice platform for the Brady kids to rehearse their song and dance numbers. _ It’s about a foot high and ten by six, with different size circular platforms for each of the kids to stand on.
