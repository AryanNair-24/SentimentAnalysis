29) 39) dialog: - OK, I guess I'll deliver my message to the absentee family. My mates and me are all gussied up in our most terrifying guises of death and doom but with no one to violate and annihilate because our target escaped us and YOU'VE inexplicably given him sanctuary.

Suddenly, there’s a: A BURST of WILD MOVEMENT in the REAR of the DINING ROOM. It's THE STRANGER - hauling ass through the BACK ENTRANCE of this ROOM as James’ light crosses his scarred frame. James, startled at first, kicks into a RUN - giving CHASE. His flashlight BOUNCING UP AND DOWN - catching fleeting glimpses of the retreating STRANGER. The Stranger thunders UP A NEARBY STAIRCASE. James RAISES HIS GUN and POP! POP! AWKWARDLY FIRES TWO SHOTS! Both missing The Stranger. James HEARS the Polite Leader’s 0.S. COMMENTARY:

The Polite Leader moves away from the observation slot, granting James VISION again. He sees: THREE PEOPLE in tattered CLOTHING - clearly HOMELESS PEOPLE - HANGING from STREET-LIGHT POLES - dead - HUNG the old-fashioned way - with NOOSES around their necks.
