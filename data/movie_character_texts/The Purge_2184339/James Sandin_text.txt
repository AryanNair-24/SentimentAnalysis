0) 0) dialog: - Mr. Calhoun, the system will be working without a hitch by the time the Purge begins. I have a service crew on their way now - MARY SANDIN - next to James - is also tanned, in healthy shape and pretty. She’s looking through magazines that feature high-priced BOATS/YACHTS for SALE - barely paying attention to the TV/INTERNET PROJECTION on the wall in front of her playing the MORNING NEWS:
0) 8) dialog: Everyone’s doing security checks, getting ready for tonight. If one system I sold has a glitch, I’1l lose the bonus. Mary kisses her husband.
0) 10) dialog: What are you gonna do today, babe?
0) 12) dialog: You’re crazy. You look amazing. (then) Did you hear the scratching last night?
0) 16) dialog: When I was 16 I wasn’t even allowed to have a girlfriend. We’re not being too harsh telling her she can’t see him on school nights.
0) 18) dialog: By ‘we’ you mean ‘me’. And I push her just enough. Look how great she’s been doing. If she continues on this track she can be an executive at Arcon, Mary. James smiles wide, excited by this idea. He kisses his wife and heads out. Alone now, Mary turns back on the TV/INTERNET PROJECTION, seeing a COMMERCIAL; a corporate feel-good spot with soothing music over tranquil images - PEOPLE PICNICKING, HOLDING BLUE BOUQUETS OF FLOWERS - as:
1) 0) text: A LONG HALL decorated with PHOTOS of the attractive SANDINS - JAMES, MARY, ZOEY and CHARLIE. We notice something at the end of this corridor - it’s a foot high moving toward us. As it draws near, we see that it’s: A RABBIT - hopping through the home. And it’s a strange Rabbit, indeed. Its fur is green and white and weathered terribly. It’s also missing its RIGHT EAR. It’s an incongruous image - the weathered Rabbit hopping through the pristine Sandin HALLS, until it comes upon: MARY SANDIN (wearing a robe now) - IN THE KITCHEN -— standing in front of the OPEN REFRIGERATOR - eating some CAKE with great fervor. After a beat, Mary spots the Rabbit. She smirks, then oddly talks to the bunny:
1) 3) text: BOXES piled in the corner - BOY’S CLOTHES hanging. It’s a CLOSET that’s been turned into a secret hiding spot - replete with a TOYS, BOOKS, DRAWINGS, as well as CANDID PHOTOS of the SANDINS - MARY, JAMES and ZOEY (NOTE: no PHOTOS of CHARLIE). We FIND: YOUNG CHARLIE SANDIN - sitting on a small CHAIR in this, his secret getaway. (NOTE: This is clearly the back of Charlie's closet - into which he disappeared earlier.) Charlie’s not only wearing those multiple LAYERS OF CLOTHES, but he’s also now donning a bizarre pair of SMALL, CIRCULAR DARK GLASSES/GOGGLES - as well as holding an I-POD NANO-LIKE DEVICE which he handles expertly. WE HOLD ON CHARLIE - in those dark GLASSES/GOGGLES, seemingly staring off at nothing until we SEE what he’s
2) 5) text: Thank you, Sandin Family. Good day. The DIGITAL SCREENS fade - and the WINDOWS return to their original state - simply being windows. James barely notes this as he calls back into his HOUSE:
2) 6) dialog: Cc’mon, kids, we’re late. A beat later, ZOEY and CHARLIE (both wearing CATHOLIC SCHOOL UNIFORMS) emerge from the home. Zoey doesn’t look at her Dad, her expression cold, moody. The trio moves to their car - drawing the attention of a NEIGHBOR across the WAY - YOUNG MR. CALI:
2) 8) dialog: I only sell the best, Mr. Cali. Same Arcon system I’m using. No one’s bothering us tonight. The neighbors share a smile as James and his children continue to their car, getting inside. Behind them, we spot MARY stepping under the THRESHOLD of her FRONT DOOR:
5) 1) dialog: - Let us give thanks on this special night - 13.
6) 1) dialog: - To the Martyrs who bring peace. To the New Founding Fathers for letting us Purge and cleanse our souls. We are extremely grateful. The family breaks their collective finger lock and James begins a nightly dinner ritual:
6) 2) dialog: - So, let’s hear about everyone’s day? Zoey, you'll go first - but Charlie - take the rabbit off the table before we begin. Please. Charlie gently puts his Rabbit on the floor as James looks at his daughter, waiting for her to begin the nightly ritual. Zoey glares harshly at her Dad:
6) 4) dialog: I do. So how did practice go? You ready for the recital? Zoey just stares at him - teenage angst screaming ‘leave me alone!’ Mary throws James a look - ‘stop bothering her.’ James ignores Mary, saying to Zoey:
6) 5) dialog: You're ready. You always are. (then) Just make sure your left hand cooperates on the 3rd concerto. Zoey doesn’t even look at her father - so mad now. Mary eyes James - ‘stop’. James relents and says: (CONTINUED)
6) 8) dialog: If you guys don’t mind, I’11l do my day next. I have some news. (then, big grin) I did it. All sales final and I’m on top. My division sold the most new Purge security systems. James is beaming. Everyone reacts with joy - except Zoey - who just rolls her eyes. Mary hugs her husband:
6) 10) dialog: The bonus was even bigger than last year. That means a huge vacation, the boat for your mom, another addition on the house, and anything else you guys want. James is ecstatic - so proud of himself, when:
6) 12) dialog: Sail. She’1ll learn to sail, Charlie. What else? Mary nods, shrugs - ‘I guess I’1ll learn to sail’ - but something about the whole question seems to have really dumbfounded her.
6) 13) dialog: OK - enough about my bonus - back to our days. Charlie, you’re up.
6) 17) dialog: Very funny. And you ladies are laughing a little too hard. I’1l get you back for that one, Charlie- boy. Beware. Mary, Zoey, and Charlie are laughing even harder now. Zoey actually high-fives her brother. James can’t help but join in. In the b.g., we HEAR the PURGE COMMERCIAL on the 0.S. TV/INTERNET PROJECTION:
6) 19) dialog: Zoey, before we hear about your Mom’s day, I wanted to remind you that we need to review your Arcon University application essay. Zoey shoots her father another nasty look, like she’s going to bite his head off. Mary jumps in:
6) 22) dialog: That's right. Mary, your day? Before Mary could answer - DING DONG. The door bell. James consults the wall-clock and his expression tightens - an unsettled look emerges - which he tries to hide. (CONTINUED)
6) 25) dialog: Oh. Look at the time. That must be Mr. Kane. I’11 show him in and then I guess we’ll begin the lock- down protocol. They all nod - clearly aware of what the ‘lock-down protocol’ is. Mary’s face sags with sudden anxiety - not unlike James’ - and she too tries to hide it. James exits.
6) 28) dialog: Mr. Kane.
6) 30) dialog: Thank you. Come in. Let me bring you downstairs. You can make yourself comfortable while I take care of some Purge preparation and then I’1l join you afterward. James escorts Mr. Kane INSIDE and then down STAIRS, into:
7) 0) text: As Mr. Kane and James walk across the LARGE BASEMENT off which SEVERAL ROOMS debouch. James and Mr. Kane continue to smile - both men being overly polite. They reach one of the BASEMENT DOORS:
7) 1) dialog: We'll do our business here. (CONTINUED)
7) 4) dialog: You can take a seat right there. I hope it’s comfortable. Mr. Kane enters and sits on the lone chair.
7) 6) dialog: Great. See you shortly, Mr. Kane. Mr. Kane smiles again. James smiles back. The ever-— present awkwardness between them reaching a crescendo. James closes the door, shutting Mr. Kane inside.
8) 2) dialog: Mr. Kane is situated. And we're only minutes away. (then) OK. Let’s get ready for the Purge. James walks to the BANK OF MONITORS - hits a NEARBY SWITCH - all the MONITORS POP ON. They are clearly SECURITY MONITORS - each DISPLAYING a DIFFERENT ANGLE of the EXTERIOR of the SANDIN HOME - the immense BACKYARD, the POOL, the tall FENCE, and the LARGE FOREST beyond. (CONTINUED)
8) 5) dialog: Look, Mr. Sabian is going hunting. Mary, Charlie, and Zoey consult the MONITORS, seeing what James is referring to: ON MONITOR - where we see a MAN EXITING a HOME ACROSS THE WAY. He’s DRESSED in FULL CAMOUFLAGE - like a SOLDIER about to go to BATTLE. He’s carrying GUNS and KNIVES.
8) 6) dialog: (seeing something else outside) And the Johnsons are having a Purge Party. Zoey, Mary, and Charlie consult ANOTHER COMPUTER SECURITY SCREEN which DISPLAYS an ANGLE of the ‘JOHNSON HOME’ DOWN THE STREET and there we SEE: 12 MEN AND WOMEN, all dressed formally in SUITS and DRESSES (their ‘Sunday best’) walking into this home. FOUR of the SUITED-MEN are carrying an old-fashioned, full-sized, functional GUILLOTINE. The Sandins eye the Guillotine. Not surprised by it.
8) 7) dialog: OK. Let’s get on with it. James OPENS (with a key) a NEARBY CABINET - REVEALING A HALF DOZEN GUNS. He removes ONE GUN and pockets it.
8) 8) dialog: As always. Just a precaution. He LOCKS the CABINET when he SPOTS something outside:
8) 9) dialog: Mr. Cali’s started his lock-down with the system I sold him. (beaming with pride) That’s just one of the many that led to this year’s bonus. They all look out the window seeing: (CONTINUED)
8) 12) dialog: OK. lLet’s lock down now. James HITS a RED BUTTON on the NEARBY WALL and, suddenly, the SAME THING HAPPENS TO THE SANDIN HOME: STEEL GATES electronically emerge from SLOTS in front of EVERY WINDOW AND DOOR of the HOME - CLOSING out all MOONLIGHT as they COVER EACH EXIT/ENTRANCE. The WHIRR of THE CLOSING BARRICADES BELLOWS ominously.
10) 0) text: As a STEEL BARRICADE closes over the WINDOW of the DEN. The family watches it shut - sealing them in. Securing the home for some unknown reason. Bringing in darkness. Mary turns on the LIGHT. James looks at the MONITORS - at all the OTHER HOMES on the CUL-DE-SAC - and now we see ELECTRONIC SECURITY BARRICADES SECURING THESE HOMES also.
10) 1) dialog: The golden rule - never, under any circumstance, are the security barricades to be opened. They all nod, rolling their eyes, they know that.
10) 2) dialog: Put on the TV, Charlie-boy. We’re seconds away. Charlie raises a remote and turns on a TV/INTERNET where we CATCH the END of the clearly over-played PURGE COMMERCIAL; images of blue flowers, picnics, as:
10) 15) dialog: I know it’s a difficult evening, guys, but remember - bad things happen in poor areas because they can’t afford protection. We’ll be fine. No worries. No one responds. James goes on:
10) 16) dialog: OK. Charlie, you'll stay in your room tonight. You’re still too young to understand the Purge.
10) 19) dialog: Mr. Kane’s last meal, Mar?
10) 21) dialog: Thanks. (then) You sure you don’t want to -
10) 25) dialog: I’m gonna go get this done. Mary goes to say something but no words come. James exits. Mary consults the MONITORS, seeing A MUTT crossing the street - otherwise the cul-de-sac is quiet. Every home is locked down. Every home’s display of flowers blooming blue under crepuscular light.
12) 0) text: SKINNY, PALE MR. KANE sits on the CHAIR in the center of the room, atop the PLASTIC SHEET, in silence. He's fidgeting and sweating. The DOOR OPENS and JAMES steps in, politely smiling, and now HOLDING a PLATE OF FOOD.
12) 1) dialog: As requested - spaghetti and meatballs, Mr. Kane.
14) 0) text: James, wearing a PLASTIC FULL-LENGTH SMOCK now, stands with MR. KANE (who’s just picking at that PLATE of FOOD as if his appetite has abandoned him). They both appear nervous as they review a STACK OF DOCUMENTS:
14) 1) dialog: - Just to review the terms - when I’ve concluded, you will be brought to City Hall and made a Martyr of the 30 Provinces. I will then make the donation to your family. Sign here. Mr. Kane signs the contract. James also signs. James then withdraws his GUN and CHECKS it for BULLETS.
14) 2) dialog: May I ask how much longer you have, Mr. Kane?
14) 4) dialog: Would you like to make a statement for Arcon’s Library of Martyrs? James finds a SMALL VIDEO RECORDER-LIKE DEVICE. Hits RECORD as:
14) 7) text: INT. MARY AND JAMES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT Mary’s still inside, still sitting on her bed in silence. She swigs her Martini, finishing it. She eyes the empty glass, contemplating getting another drink, when: A subtle 0.S. NOISE gets her attention. It’S LAUGHTER. A CREEPY BURST of GIGGLING - FROM OUTSIDE. Mary tenses, there’s something disconcerting about it. She gingerly moves to the WINDOW - LOOKING out the OBSERVATION SLOT, seeing: A HINT OF MOVEMENT in the FOREST BEHIND HER BACKYARD FENCE. A FLASH OF WHITE that disappears. Mary, alerted, stares out - not seeing anything now - when suddenly: AHHHHHH! An O.S. mindless SCREAM of fear ERUPTS from INSIDE her home. Mary nearly jumps out of her skin when the SCREAM is followed by BANG! The concussive SOUND of an O.S. GUNSHOT. Mary knows what it is. She freezes.
15) 0) text: HOLD ON THE BASEMENT DOOR - behind which James is with Mr. Kane. The DOOR OPENS and JAMES emerges. He has removed the PLASTIC OVERCOAT. We catch a glimpse of Mr. Kane’s LIMP LEGS - blood pooled around his feet. James locks the door before we see any more. He places the key under the rug. James stands there, not moving, face red. James begins to cry, releasing emotion, very shaken by his ‘Purge’. After a beat of crying, James takes a deep breath - as if he’s trying to convince himself that the ‘Purging’ he just did was a ‘good, cleansing act’. After several breaths, he assumes his confident facade again. He walks up the STAIRS and ENTERS:
16) 0) text: As James steps into the FOYER, he immediately SEES THAT: ALL THE WINDOWS in his FOYER are now acting as DIGITAL MONITORS (just as the front windows did in the morning), DISPLAYING that same PLEASANT WOMAN from earlier:
16) 6) dialog: I know how necessary it is - I just remind myself what it was like before Arcon and the Purge - but it’s still so damn hard. Mary stands, hugging her tormented husband - her face sullen, she’s also quietly anguished by James’ Purge. She changes the subject, pointing at the MONITORS:
17) 0) text: James and Mary are staring at the SECURITY MONITORS - specifically the MONITOR that DISPLAYS AN ANGLE OF THE FOREST BEHIND THEIR HOME.
17) 2) dialog: I don’t see anything. Maybe it was the raccoon who’s been digging in our walls. Don’t worry, Mar - who would bother us? Mary turns from the monitor, looking at James, spotting BLOOD on his neck, dripping under his clothes. (CONTINUED)
17) 6) dialog: Damnit. I’11 go wash it off. James exits quickly. Mary follows. WE STAY BEHIND - looking at THE MONITORS. And on the MONITOR DISPLAYING THE FOREST BEHIND THE HOUSE - we see it again - MOVEMENT IT’S CLEARLY A PERSON. A PERSON WEARING a big silly SMILEY FACE MASK. This Masked Person appears briefly, looking up at the Sandin home, then quickly disappears into the night like a demented wraith.
20) 0) text: James is out of the tub - clean now. Mary is helping him into a robe. They move about in pensive silence, when a sudden RUMBLE OF SOUND rises - it’s the SECURITY BARRICADE OPENING on the BATHROOM WINDOW behind them.
20) 1) dialog: What the hell?
22) 0) text: As James (dressed now) ENTERS in a BURST. HE SLAMS HIS HAND against the RED SECURITY BUTTON and suddenly WHIRR - the SOUND of the STEEL BULWARKS CLOSING RISES AGAIN.
23) 4) dialog: 
23) 7) dialog: What did you do, Charlie? Do you know this man?
23) 9) dialog: You know the rule, Charlie - never open the security doors.
23) 11) dialog: That’s not our business, Charlie. (CONTINUED)
23) 15) dialog: That’s not our business either. (then, to STRANGER) Sir, my son made a child’s mistake. You can’t stay here.
23) 17) dialog: But we don’t know how he got hurt. Maybe he isn’t being hunted - maybe he’s doing the hunting.
23) 19) dialog: - Charlie, shut up now, son. James admonishes Charlie with a look, then turns back to the Stranger who holds James’ eye. Tension building rapidly. Mary breaks the moment - considering the Stranger’s tattered clothes, long beard and dirty hair.
23) 21) dialog: Stop asking him questions, Mar.
23) 23) dialog: (to Stranger) You must leave now, sir.
23) 25) dialog: 
23) 30) dialog: OK, enough. Sir, I am sorry if you’re being hunted but that’s what happens tonight. I’m just trying to protect my family. Mary, open the damn door. The Stranger looks at Mary - he then speaks for the first time - a low, raspy grunt:
23) 33) dialog: What? Is that Henry? Why -
23) 35) dialog: Charlie, please! (then) Why is Henry here, Mary?
23) 41) dialog: Henry, this is not the time! James and The Stranger are still locked on each other but Henry's O.S. VOICE has James very distracted now. Mary steps BACK - toward the CIRCULAR STAIRCASE BEHIND THEM. And there, at the TOP of the STAIRS, she sees: HENRY. Standing very very still.
23) 45) dialog: SIR - DO NOT MOVE! Henry, go back upstairs! Jesus!
23) 48) dialog: 
23) 57) dialog: 
24) 8) dialog: 
25) 0) text: Mary is still frantically checking James for wounds. James is breathing heavy, scared, devastated, freaked:
25) 2) dialog: I shot back. I couldn’t help it! TELL ME I DIDN’T HIT ZOEY!
25) 9) dialog: - Jesus Christ! This can’t be happening! What was Henry thin- James stops, noticing something that breaks his meltdown:
25) 10) dialog: - Where is he? Where the hell is that Man, Charlie? Beat.
25) 12) dialog: Fuck, Charlie! Who knows what this Man’s capable of! He could be anywhere! What are -
25) 14) dialog: You’re right. We need to move.
27) 0) text: WHAM! The DOOR SWINGS OPEN and JAMES, MARY AND CHARLIE enter a ROOM replete with a POOL TABLE, PINBALL MACHINE, and PING PONG TABLE. (NOTE: They’re completely unaware of what’s happening outside). James shuts the door as Charlie moves away from his devastated parents - just watching them come undone. Mary sinks into a chair - traumatized, still trembling.
27) 2) dialog: OK. Here’s what we’re gonna do. You two stay put. I’11 go find Zoey and bring her back here. Mary looks at James as if he’s lost his head:
27) 6) dialog: I DON’T CARE! I NEED TO SEE IF ZOEY’S OK AND GET HER AWAY FROM
27) 11) dialog: I don’t want you out there alone with that Man.
27) 13) dialog: You sure you can do this? Mary shakes her head - she doesn’t know. Husband and Wife share one last desperate look. Mary then moves off, leaving James and Charlie behind.
29) 0) text: James paces back and forth, mind racing, still in shock. (CONTINUED)
29) 3) dialog: - Are you OK? Where’s Zoey? Still getting her breath back - barely able to speak:
29) 6) dialog: Oh my god. No. They hold a sobering look. Mary’s still freaking - fear eating her alive. James suddenly MOVES to the door:
29) 7) dialog: I need to go get Zoey. Mary quickly steps in front of him - stopping him:
29) 9) dialog: Why?
29) 11) dialog: What is it?
29) 15) dialog: A ‘threat’. From my daughter.
29) 17) dialog: OK. We’ll let her calm down. (then) But what about the Homeless Man?
29) 22) dialog: (responding to Mary) Maybe he doesn’t. JZoey’s out there with him. And then, out of nowhere, CHARLIE SCREAMS at the top of his lungs:
29) 33) text: Mr. and Mrs. Sandin - I sure hope you can hear me because this concerns you and yours. Something about hearing their name sends a chill up everyone’s spine. James stops pacing:
29) 34) dialog: It's coming from the front. They quickly move to the WINDOWS in front of the room. All looking through the OBSERVATION SLOTS into the FRONT YARD AND THE STREET BEYOND. And as soon as they look out - they all JUMP, STARTLED BY WHATEVER THEY ARE SEEING:
29) 45) dialog: It’s him.
29) 47) dialog: No. The Homeless Man. He killed the lights because he doesn’t want to be found. He doesn’t want to go back out there. (beat) Understandably.
29) 49) dialog: I don’t know. It’s hard to say.
29) 52) dialog: (losing it) I DON’T KNOW! It’s more of a deterrent - it looks good so it keeps people away! Goddamn it, things like this aren’t supposed to happen in this neighborhood!
29) 56) dialog: We have to give them what they want. We find the Homeless Man and force him outside. We have guns - he doesn’t. We can do this. It’s the only way. Charlie reacts - shocked by that:
29) 58) dialog: Christ, Charlie, it’s either him or us, son.
29) 60) dialog: Because I don’t want to. And I don’t want you, your mother, or your sister to. James looks to Mary for support. Mary takes a beat - then reluctantly nods, agreeing. Charlie’s face falls, devastated, as:
29) 62) dialog: Of course not. We do this together. Let’s pray Zoey has calmed down. (dramatically) (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
29) 65) dialog: We don’t have a choice, guys. If we don’t find this Man, we’re not gonna make it through the night. That hangs there. Off their terrified faces - CUT TO BLACK. UNTIL A FLASHLIGHT BEAM CUTS A SWATH IN THE DARK.
31) 0) text: Dark, and dreadfully silent here also. ANOTHER FLASHLIGHT fractures the black. WE FIND: JAMES - moving down a DIFFERENT HALL - careful footfalls on wood floors - he, too, is searching for the Stranger. Suddenly, an 0O.S. VOICE penetrates the eerie silence:
34) 0) text: As James creeps along - searching every nook and cranny of his home for the Stranger. He turns into the DINING ROOM, flashlight COMBING the area. Suddenly, there’s a: A BURST of WILD MOVEMENT in the REAR of the DINING ROOM. It's THE STRANGER - hauling ass through the BACK ENTRANCE of this ROOM as James’ light crosses his scarred frame. James, startled at first, kicks into a RUN - giving CHASE. His flashlight BOUNCING UP AND DOWN - catching fleeting glimpses of the retreating STRANGER. The Stranger thunders UP A NEARBY STAIRCASE. James RAISES HIS GUN and POP! POP! AWKWARDLY FIRES TWO SHOTS! Both missing The Stranger. James HEARS the Polite Leader’s 0.S. COMMENTARY:
38) 0) text: As James searches for the Stranger in the GYM, he HEARS:
38) 13) text: Tickety Tock. Tickety Tock. You’re time is almost up. James just stares out - his terror intensifying.
40) 0) text: WHOOSH! A BURST of MOVEMENT in the dark - it’s JAMES - moving FAST now - very motivated after seeing the ‘hanging homeless’. He’s opening closets, checking under beds, looking for the Stranger everywhere. BACK TO:
42) 0) text: James is frantically searching for the Stranger when he HEARS a O.S. NOISE - down the hall. Muffled SCREAMS - SOUNDS of STRUGGLE - the same sounds Charlie just heard. James journeys toward the sounds - which bring him to: INT. CHARLIE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS As James enters - finger on the trigger - flashlight covers the room, and to James’ utter surprise it unexpectedly illuminates: THE BLOODY STRANGER - in front of the closet now. James freezes, startled, excited that he’s found the Stranger - he targets him with his gun, when the Stranger speaks - for only the second time - his raspy whisper:
42) 6) dialog: Please don’t hurt her. James backs up, out of Charlie’s room - into the:
42) 8) dialog: Let her go, you sonofabitch!
44) 0) text: As the standoff between James and the Stranger continues:
44) 2) dialog: You’re going to get us killed!
44) 7) dialog: Please leave my family alone.
45) 0) text: Charlie sits frozen in the darkness - the 0.S. SHOUTING between James and the Stranger is RISING. The young boy can’t take it any longer - he suddenly STANDS and RUNS FOR THE DOOR.
46) 0) text: James and the Stranger still negotiating - Zoey’s MOANS rising under that makeshift muzzle.
46) 1) dialog: We’ve done nothing to you. We don’t deserve this.
46) 5) dialog: 
46) 11) dialog: 
46) 16) dialog: Get some rope, Mary! Go get some rope so we can get him outside and end this fucking night!
47) 0) text: LIT by a few CANDLES. ZOEY’S on a couch, still unconscious. CHARLIE’S next to ZOEY - the young boy looks horrified as he stares at: JAMES and MARY - who have dragged the BLOODY SCALPED SHOT STRANGER into this room and are now in the midst of trying to secure him to a DESK CHAIR so they can deliver him (roll him out) to the Freaks. But the Stranger (gagged, limbs bound with duct tape) is not making it easy - he’s fighting like a rabid dog as the Sandins cruelly and clumsily attempt to roll him INTO the CHAIR which is lying on its side (to accommodate the Stranger’s forced entry into it). It's pure chaos - the wealthy suburban Sandins are bruised, sweating, screaming, as they struggle furiously with the Stranger - his blood flying all over them.
47) 1) dialog: Push, Mary, before he He’s too strong. I’m so breaks the rope again - sorry sir.
47) 6) dialog: Get his legs, Mary! HE’S BREAKING
47) 12) dialog: Sit on his wound, Mary.
47) 14) dialog: Just do it! It’ll work. Devastated - teary-eyed:
47) 17) dialog: If he just walked outside willingly, we wouldn’t have to do any of this. Charlie suddenly STANDS UP DEFIANTLY. Behind him - Zoey'’s watching again - peaking out - as: (CONTINUED)
47) 22) dialog: Charlie, enough! - Mary, sit on his wound! We don’t have time! I’‘1ll hold him. - Sir, you're making it harder on yourself - Mary has her hands on her head - conflicted, emotionally ravaged BUT she abides James’ command and SITS on the STRANGER’S WOUND - HE BUCKS in INTENSE PAIN! Charlie reacts - almost screaming. The Stranger stops resisting for a beat and James seizes the moment - he pushes the Stranger’s body into the chair - it worked.
47) 23) dialog: Tie him in, Mary! We got ‘em! Charlie lowers his head, defeated. Mary’s expression goes slack as she stares at the Stranger - seeing the agony on his face. James sees his wife’s ghostly look:
47) 24) dialog: You had no choice, Mary. It’s almost over. No response - Mary looks absolutely destroyed. A funereal silence consumes the room as they secure the Stranger to the chair - getting ready to wheel him out to his death. The quiet is broken by:
47) 30) dialog: Mary - relax, keep tying him down. We don’t have time. Mary drops the tape and stands - pacing feverishly - all her emotions boiling up.
47) 32) dialog: Mary, we don’t have a choice here. Mary EXPLODES:
47) 34) dialog: Mary, we don’t have time for this. Mary pulls away - SCREAMING at the top of her lungs now:
47) 38) dialog: What the fuck is that now? These dissonant SOUNDS have pulled Mary out of her meltdown. And that’s when she turns and sees that: CHARLIE IS GONE. The young boy is no longer in the room. (CONTINUED)
49) 0) text: James stands in the middle of the room (that noise rising around him) still in shock after Mary’s breakdown. He's looking at the BLOODY STRANGER - tied to the chair, staring at him. James walks toward the Stranger.
49) 1) dialog: I’m sorry, sir, but I don’t see any other way. James is just about to wheel the Stranger outside, when:
49) 5) dialog: You hit your head, baby. Zoey looks long and hard at James through glassy eyes.
49) 6) dialog: Zoey - how do you feel? Long beat - then she mutters something under her breath.
49) 7) dialog: Don’t speak, baby. (then) I’m so sorry about Henry. I really am. Zoey stares at her father. Face sallow and numb. She sits up, just looking at James with a thousand yard stare. He smiles at her reassuringly. He then leans forward and embraces her, holding her tight. Zoey sees, behind James: A LETTER OPENER lying on a nearby desk.
49) 8) dialog: We’re gonna make it through tonight. It’s all gonna be OK soon, baby. Zoey takes the LETTER OPENER in her hand. She slowly raises it behind James’ back. Her hand is trembling. She’s starting to cry as she brings the glass high, when - James HEARS his daughter weeping. He breaks the embrace, and immediately sees: Zoey holding that LETTER OPENER in her trembling hand. She’s teary-eyed, staring at him. And before James could react: Zoey feebly SLASHES at him. It’s a sad, pathetic strike but the LETTER OPENER’S SHARP EDGE connects with James’ CHEEK - opening it up. BLOOD SPEWS. James steps back, holding his face, shell-shocked. Zoey steps back too, crying more now. She seems unable to move, stuck in stance of stunned belief - Zoey is completely shocked by what she just did. She looks like a lost, confused young girl. Father and Daughter stand feet apart, not moving. (CONTINUED)
49) 11) dialog: Zoey. Zoey DROPS the OPENER and RUNS OUT of the room, as if running away from her own actions. She retreats down the hall, disappearing in the darkness. James stands numb for a beat - he touches the blood on his face - then the tears come. He’s unable to control it. James is, right here, a completely broken man. He sees: THE BLOODY STRANGER across the room - lit by candles - a wraith in flickering light, silently observing him. James approaches the bound Stranger and stands over him just as he stood over Mr. Kane earlier. James stares at the Stranger, then TURNS and EXITS the room, closing the door, shutting the Stranger within.
50) 0) text: As James stands in the hall in front of the closed door - behind which is the Stranger. James is motionless, lost, when he sees: MARY - moving quickly down the hall towards him. Charlie is conspicuously NOT with her.
50) 2) dialog: Zoey ran out. I don’t know where she is. Where’s Charlie? Fighting tears:
50) 8) dialog: No. Leave the Soldier in there. Mary doesn’t understand:
50) 10) dialog: I have another idea. And before Mary could question what that idea is, they
50) 13) dialog: The Soldier’s gonna be OK, Charlie. Don’t worry anymore. You were right. Charlie stares at his Dad - so relieved, so thankful. James smiles sadly at his son as he continues:
50) 14) dialog: Mary, take Charlie to the basement. Take the weapons. Zoey will be with you shortly - James hands Mary the pink pillowcase full of guns. Mary’s still very confused:
50) 18) dialog: No time. Trust me. I love you. All of you. Now go. Go. James kisses Mary and Charlie. Mary’s still baffled but listens to her husband, taking her son and running off. James watches them go, tears in his eyes. THAT O.S. RUMBLE GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDER.
51) 16) dialog: Standing by the BASEMENT DOOR through which Charlie and Mary just entered. James is MOVING a LARGE PIECE OF FURNITURE in FRONT of that DOOR - blocking it for some reason. This was the source of the BANGING Mary heard. James then crosses the home, to the FRONT DOOR - the SOUND of those ENGINES and STEEL BARRICADES being PULLED resonates all around him. James then does something else very strange - he OPENS the FRONT DOOR - revealing the SECURITY BARRICADE that protects it. SAME: MARY —- BASEMENT STAIRS Hauling ass up the stairs. She reaches the BASEMENT DOOR - tries to open it but BANG! It’s blocked. (CONTINUED)
51) 20) dialog: Opening the LATCH at the base of the SECURITY BARRICADE. He takes a moment, mustering up the courage to OPEN the BARRICADE, revealing THE FRONT YARD of HIS HOME - BATHED in the ASTRAL GLOW of THE TRUCK HEADLIGHTS. THE THUNDEROUS ROAR of the TRUCK ENGINES is DEAFENING HERE. James stands there, vulnerable - he squints, barely seeing THE POLITE LEADER and HIS CRONIES just 20 yards away - silhouettes against the LIGHT. James SCREAMS:
51) 21) dialog: 
51) 24) dialog: We couldn’t find him.
51) 26) dialog: Wait. I would never deny your right to Purge. Instead of him - take me. You can still do what you set out to do. Just please don’t hurt my family - don’t come inside - do what you will to me. Polite Leader and his Cronies are silent - just staring at James curiously. James is holding his arms out - giving himself up - ready to die. He doesn’t see: (CONTINUED)
51) 29) dialog: Me instead of him - just don’t hurt my family. Off Zoey’s fear and confusion -
51) 31) dialog: It's a fair trade. You still get to Purge. The Stranger takes in those words when his eyes fall on: THE LETTER OPENER with which Zoey slashed James, on the floor, just a yard from him. He eyes it.
51) 33) dialog: Arms outstretched - body bathed in light - completely vulnerable to the Polite Leader and his Freaks:
51) 34) dialog: Please - take me - don’t hur- Suddenly - WHUMP! James stops mid-sentence, body flinching as if electrified. He looks down at: THE ARROW now penetrating his SHOULDER. He’s been shot with an arrow by the Casper the Ghost-Masked Apache. His face blanches with pain and shock when WHUMP! Another ARROW penetrates his STOMACH, spraying blood. SAME: MARY —- BEHIND BASEMENT DOOR SLAMMING HER BODY into the BASEMENT DOOR and WHOOSH! The FURNITURE tumbles over - the door swings open and Mary’s through - SPRINTING across the HOUSE, finding: (CONTINUED)
51) 37) dialog: On his hands and knees - crawling from the door - there’s arrows STICKING out of his SHOULDER, STOMACH and LEG now. There’s blood everywhere and he can’t move fast. More ARROWS JETTISON through the door - just missing James as:
51) 41) dialog: Look at us, Mary... I’m so SOrry.... His statement hangs there like a confession. Mary begins to cry. Husband and Wife hold a desperate look, when: THE SOUND AROUND THEM REACHES A FEVER PITCH - the HOUSE IS TREMBLING TUMULTUOUSLY. This all CULMINATES in a
51) 45) dialog: We fight, baby. We fight for Charlie and Zoey.
51) 47) dialog: No. It’s too late for that. We -
51) 49) dialog: I’m not gonna be OK, baby. But you and Zoey and Charlie -
51) 51) dialog: - Listen to me. I need you to live. Do what I say - prop me up against the wall here. I/’11 kill any motherfucker who comes inside. You cover the other side of the house. We have to protect the kids now, Mary. She staring at him - crying, terrified - but knows he’s right. She HELPS HIM UP - he’s groaning - spewing blood - but with Mary’s aide James pulls himself over to a nearby WALL that faces the ENTRANCE and SEVERAL HALLWAYS. He slides down the wall - leaning against it. Mary withdraws several guns from the pillowcase - puts them in James’ lap, when they see SILHOUETTES of those FREAKS creeping toward their home. Mary kisses James.
51) 53) dialog: I love you. Crying, they hold one last stare before Mary takes off with the remaining weapons in the pillowcase. (CONTINUED)
51) 59) dialog: James sits, scared, bleeding out - as those SHADOWS of FREAKS MOVE OUTSIDE. He HEARS LAUGHTER here also - and HOWLING and SOMEONE SINGING a haunting CHILD’S LULLABY - and THE FREAKS BANGING - WHAM! WHAM! On DOORS, WINDOWS. He’s peering around, vulnerable. SUDDENLY WHAM! AN AXE DECIMATES the FRONT DOOR. James blanches - then SHOOTS, unloading a CLIP into the DOOR. But the AXE disappears - no one’s there any longer. His gunfire useless. James continues eyeing the FRONT DOOR - not seeing: (CONTINUED)
51) 63) dialog: Trembling as he reloads his GUN, when he spies movement on his periphery - it’s CHARLIE - layered up and out in the open. James also sees: THE APACHE - on his feet now and RUNNING at CHARLIE. He’s seconds away from slicing CHARLIE when James raises his gun and BAM! SHOOTS him in the CHEST - the Apache falls at Charlie’s feet, dying. James then SPOTS: A SILHOUETTE - in the WINDOW FRAME on CHARLIE’S RIGHT. This SILHOUETTE raises a GUN to TARGET CHARLIE.
51) 64) dialog: 
51) 66) dialog: Are you shot? Are you cut? (CONTINUED)
51) 70) dialog: It's OK, Charlie-boy. As long as you're OK. Charlie’s eyes are filling with tears.
51) 72) dialog: No, son. Gimme your gun and go hide. Go now. Charlie hands James his gun and runs off. James turns and to his utter surprise he sees SILHOUETTES of FREAKS - EVERYWHERE. As if there’s a FREAK at EVERY WINDOW now. Too many to target. He doesn’t know what to do. INT. MARY’S WORK ROOM - NIGHT Where the Bleeding Stranger, still bound to that chair, has pushed himself over - tipping the chair on its side. He’s inched himself upon the LETTER OPENER he saw earlier. He has it in his hands (which are tied behind his back) and he’s attempting to cut the rope that binds him. GO TO:
51) 82) dialog: Did you see them Mary?
51) 84) dialog: I don’t know who they are but they saved us. Mary's overwhelmed with emotion. She’s caressing James’ face - knowing he’s about to die at any moment, when:
51) 94) dialog: I love you, baby. It’s not your fault. It’s this night. Listen to your Mom now. And make it through tonight - for me. (CONTINUED)
