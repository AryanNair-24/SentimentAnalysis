42) 0) text: James is frantically searching for the Stranger when he HEARS a O.S. NOISE - down the hall. Muffled SCREAMS - SOUNDS of STRUGGLE - the same sounds Charlie just heard. James journeys toward the sounds - which bring him to: INT. CHARLIE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS As James enters - finger on the trigger - flashlight covers the room, and to James’ utter surprise it unexpectedly illuminates: THE BLOODY STRANGER - in front of the closet now. James freezes, startled, excited that he’s found the Stranger - he targets him with his gun, when the Stranger speaks - for only the second time - his raspy whisper:

46) 2) dialog: I don’t deserve it either. It’s not an honor to die tonight. Mary's right upon The Stranger now - pulling the knife back with unsteady hands, sweating profusely, ready to strike, but hesitating - unable to make a move. Her conflict obvious. James’ eyes widen with anticipation and frustration and that’s when his FLASHLIGHT ILLUMINATES: A BURST OF MOVEMENT BEHIND MARY. IT’S CHARLIE - RUNNING into the HALL behind his mother. (CONTINUED)
46) 15) dialog: Who’s on the FLOOR now - SHOT and BLEEDING from a BULLET WOUND to his SIDE. He’s staring up at James (and James’ GUN) like a fierce animal CAUGHT in a trap. Mary can’t believe it. Charlie’s devastated that the Stranger’s been caught. Out of breath, James says:
49) 0) text: James stands in the middle of the room (that noise rising around him) still in shock after Mary’s breakdown. He's looking at the BLOODY STRANGER - tied to the chair, staring at him. James walks toward the Stranger.

MARY, covered in blood, sits at the HEAD of the table. CHARLIE and ZOEY are next to her. Also veiled in blood. Charlie is still wearing the layers of clothes - he is also donning his odd GLASSES and playing with the REMOTE. The BLOODY STRANGER stands behind everyone (his wounds also bandaged) - he’s covering the Neighbors with his gun. He’s cleaned up and standing tall - he looks like an absolute bad ass - the soldier he used to be. The NEIGHBORS all have their heads down, EATING a big, nearly gourmet BREAKFAST of OMELETTES, PANCAKES, FRENCH TOAST, POTATOES, BACON, CEREAL, FRUIT, etc. (CONTINUED)

54) 25) dialog: You wouldn’t have listened. No one listens.
54) 27) dialog: Maybe it’s time to make people listen. No matter what it takes. Mary holds a look with the Stranger. BLOODY STRANGER (CONT’D) Will you and your children be OK? Mary considers the question - tears welling in her eyes.
