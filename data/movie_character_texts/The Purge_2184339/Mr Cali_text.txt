2) 7) dialog: Mr. Sandin - I just tested the new system - it’s working perfectly.
6) 29) dialog: Mr. Sandin. Sorry I was almost late - the traffic - everyone rushing to get off the streets before the Purge begins. (then) What a beautiful home, sir.
7) 0) text: As Mr. Kane and James walk across the LARGE BASEMENT off which SEVERAL ROOMS debouch. James and Mr. Kane continue to smile - both men being overly polite. They reach one of the BASEMENT DOORS:
7) 5) dialog: It’s very comfortable.
12) 0) text: SKINNY, PALE MR. KANE sits on the CHAIR in the center of the room, atop the PLASTIC SHEET, in silence. He's fidgeting and sweating. The DOOR OPENS and JAMES steps in, politely smiling, and now HOLDING a PLATE OF FOOD.
12) 2) dialog: It smells wonderful, Mr. Sandin. James closes the door behind him - shutting us out.
14) 0) text: James, wearing a PLASTIC FULL-LENGTH SMOCK now, stands with MR. KANE (who’s just picking at that PLATE of FOOD as if his appetite has abandoned him). They both appear nervous as they review a STACK OF DOCUMENTS:
14) 3) dialog: Under two months. The cancer has spread all over. The pain is unbearable. I thank you for this.
14) 5) dialog: I'd like to say that I hope the money that comes from my death helps my family get by but more importantly that I am remembered as someone who sacrificed himself to make this country a safe place. (then) It is an honor to die tonight.
15) 0) text: HOLD ON THE BASEMENT DOOR - behind which James is with Mr. Kane. The DOOR OPENS and JAMES emerges. He has removed the PLASTIC OVERCOAT. We catch a glimpse of Mr. Kane’s LIMP LEGS - blood pooled around his feet. James locks the door before we see any more. He places the key under the rug. James stands there, not moving, face red. James begins to cry, releasing emotion, very shaken by his ‘Purge’. After a beat of crying, James takes a deep breath - as if he’s trying to convince himself that the ‘Purging’ he just did was a ‘good, cleansing act’. After several breaths, he assumes his confident facade again. He walks up the STAIRS and ENTERS:
18) 0) text: Where the RABBIT sits unmoving behind the basement door. The BLOOD that runs under the door stains Victor’s fur. We HEAR FOOTSTEPS O.S. as CHARLIE suddenly appears at the base of the STAIRS behind Victor, out of breath. He runs up beside his Rabbit - joining it behind that DOOR. He stares down at the red puddle pooling on the floor. Charlie clearly had to see the blood in person. Charlie lifts the floor mat - finds the KEY. He pauses, terrified. He finally musters up the gumption to: UNLOCK AND OPEN THAT DOOR. Charlie pauses - staring into the room - at the 0.S. dead Mr. Kane. We don’t see what Charlie sees. But we see the color drain from his soft face. Charlie finally closes the door. He stands there next to his Rabbit, horrified by what he’s seen. Young Charlie is unable to move.
19) 0) text: Charlie is walking through the home now, devastated from viewing MR. KANE’S CORPSE. His Rabbit is not with him. He continues on, when he HEARS an O.S. protracted SOUND. He takes note. Walking onward - through the barricaded home - when he HEARS THAT SOUND AGAIN. It’s a SCREAM. A MAN’S SCREAM. From OUTSIDE. Charlie WALKS to a WINDOW - peers out the OBSERVATION SLOT. CHARLIE’S POV OF THE STREET: Charlie peers around the neighborhood, when he SPOTS: A DISTANT FIGURE - RUNNING toward the CUL-DE-SAC. The DISTANT FIGURE IS STUMBLING and YELLING in fear/pain. Charlie stares at this RUNNING FIGURE. As ‘it’ draws CLOSER, we can see that it is a TALL MAN - with streaks of FRESH BLOOD striating his entire body. He’s running forward but looking back. He’s clearly being HUNTED. Charlie looks down the street - DOESN’T SEE THE PURSUERS. HOLD ON CHARLIE’S FACE for a long beat - twisted in concern and empathy as he watches this desperate, bloody man stumbling down the CUL-DE-SAC. SUDDENLY: Charlie SPINS AND SPRINTS across his HOME. WE FOLLOW HIM DOWN A HALL. Up a flight of STAIRS. Through the KITCHEN. Down another HALL. And into THE DEN/SECURITY ROOM. He peers at the SECURITY MONITORS - sees that BLOODY MAN still struggling down the street. Charlie doesn’t hesitate - WHAM! HE HITS THE RED SECURITY BARRICADE BUTTON ON THE WALL.
30) 0) text: MARY - holding that flashlight - moving slowly down a dark hall, absolutely terrified. She has her gun up and out. She is clearly looking for the Stranger. The big search, through her once peaceful home, is underway. She comes upon a DOOR. Slowly opens it, wary, shining her light within - illuminating: A DEAD BODY - at first we don’t know who it is - then we realize its MR. KANE. HIS FACE BLUE, SWOLLEN. ONE GUNSHOT in his HEAD, ONE in his CHEST. Mary stares, unnerved. She closes the door.
