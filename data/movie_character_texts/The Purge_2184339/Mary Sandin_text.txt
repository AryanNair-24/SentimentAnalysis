0) 6) dialog: Look at this one, baby. Perfect. James smiles - silently agreeing - as: JAMES (ON PHONE, CONT’D) - Mr. Calhoun, Arcon makes the strongest steel in the world. You will be locked in tight tonight. - Yessir, bye now. James hangs up the phone.
0) 7) dialog: (re: phone call) Everything OK, babe?
0) 9) dialog: It'll be fine. Now go get ready. James stands. As he puts on a robe:
0) 11) dialog: Not sure. Definitely go for a run. Eating way too much lately.
0) 13) dialog: It woke me up at 3. What the hell is it? It’s driving me crazy. James shrugs - no idea. He starts out of the room, when Mary stops him with: (CONTINUED)
0) 15) dialog: Babe, before you go - we need to talk to Zoey about this Henry thing. She’s getting worse, moody all the time.
0) 17) dialog: Sometimes I think we push her too hard, hun.
1) 0) text: A LONG HALL decorated with PHOTOS of the attractive SANDINS - JAMES, MARY, ZOEY and CHARLIE. We notice something at the end of this corridor - it’s a foot high moving toward us. As it draws near, we see that it’s: A RABBIT - hopping through the home. And it’s a strange Rabbit, indeed. Its fur is green and white and weathered terribly. It’s also missing its RIGHT EAR. It’s an incongruous image - the weathered Rabbit hopping through the pristine Sandin HALLS, until it comes upon: MARY SANDIN (wearing a robe now) - IN THE KITCHEN -— standing in front of the OPEN REFRIGERATOR - eating some CAKE with great fervor. After a beat, Mary spots the Rabbit. She smirks, then oddly talks to the bunny:
1) 1) dialog: No pictures, Charlie. I woke up hungry. This is our secret.
1) 3) text: BOXES piled in the corner - BOY’S CLOTHES hanging. It’s a CLOSET that’s been turned into a secret hiding spot - replete with a TOYS, BOOKS, DRAWINGS, as well as CANDID PHOTOS of the SANDINS - MARY, JAMES and ZOEY (NOTE: no PHOTOS of CHARLIE). We FIND: YOUNG CHARLIE SANDIN - sitting on a small CHAIR in this, his secret getaway. (NOTE: This is clearly the back of Charlie's closet - into which he disappeared earlier.) Charlie’s not only wearing those multiple LAYERS OF CLOTHES, but he’s also now donning a bizarre pair of SMALL, CIRCULAR DARK GLASSES/GOGGLES - as well as holding an I-POD NANO-LIKE DEVICE which he handles expertly. WE HOLD ON CHARLIE - in those dark GLASSES/GOGGLES, seemingly staring off at nothing until we SEE what he’s
1) 5) dialog: 
1) 10) dialog: Morning kiddo. How’s the vitals?
1) 12) dialog: We heard it too. Your dad thinks it’s an animal stuck in the wall.
1) 14) dialog: Are you layering again, Charlie? Charlie lowers his eyes, embarrassed by this. Mary leans forward, gently pulling the covers off her son -— revealing his THREE SHIRTS and THREE PAIRS OF UNDERWEAR.
1) 16) dialog: I won't. But don’t be embarrassed by this, or checking your vitals, or whatever. Who knows why we do things, baby? It’s all OK. Charlie smiles - feeling better. Mary ruffles his hair and then tickles him - she adores her quirky boy. Their laughter finally whittles, and as Mary stares at her son, she sees his expression tighten into worry - just as it did when he saw the DATE in his calendar book earlier.
1) 17) dialog: (knowingly) It’s tonight, isn’t it, Charlie? Charlie nods, ‘yes it is’. (CONTINUED)
1) 19) dialog: You have to remember all the good that comes from the Purge. OK? Charlie doesn’t respond. Mary changes the subject:
1) 20) dialog: C’mon, tell me what you want for breakfast, baby.
2) 9) dialog: Bye guys, have a good day. Mary waves to her family as they drive off. WE STAY BEHIND, with Mary, when she looks up at the: SKY-BOARDS - enormous 3D ‘billboards’ hovering in the sky - an array of advertisements, government announcements, news headlines. Times Square in the heavens. Colorful digital images grabbing people’s attention from on high. Most of the SKY-BOARDS are from ARCON and pertain to THE PURGE - i.e. BE PROUD AND PURGE; THE PURGE SAVED AMERICA! Mary considers the Sky-boards, when:
2) 15) dialog: What could I have possibly done to deserve a gift, Mrs. Ferrin?
2) 20) dialog: Thank you. And I recommend our guy - Jacobson - a genius. They trade polite smiles - a hint of competition hangs in the air between them. Mary breaks the moment:
2) 21) dialog: So, any plans for the Purge? (CONTINUED)
2) 25) dialog: Thanks so much for the cookies, Mrs. Ferrin.
3) 0) text: As Mary steps in, carrying those cookies. We FOLLOW HER THROUGH - noticing how enormous and beautiful her home is - winding halls - multiple staircases - dozens of rooms.
4) 0) text: An elaborate home workout room. Mary ENTERS. Before starting her run, she tries one of MRS. FERRIN’S COOKIES. She immediately grimaces and spits the cookie into the tissue, disgusted. Surprised, she puts down the plate. Mary steps onto a treadmill. She starts to run, when her eyes fall on a nearby WALL CALENDAR - on today’s date: TUESDAY, MARCH 21. THE ANNUAL PURGE. An unsettled look rises on her face. Mary runs faster. FADE TO BLACK.
6) 9) dialog: Congratulations! So proud of you, baby. Way to go, Dad. James can’t stop smiling.
6) 20) dialog: James, for godsakes, we spoke about this. She doesn’t always have to be working. (to Zoey) Zoey, I'm giving you permission to ignore him. Zoey doesn’t respond, she’s ignoring everyone now, head down, eating. James goes to say something but Mary’s expression admonishes - ‘no more.’ He shuts his mouth.
8) 0) text: A ROOM with a BANK OF 12 HI-TECH COMPUTER SCREENS - SET UP LIKE SECURITY MONITORS ON A WALL. They are not on. MARY, ZOEY AND CHARLIE are ALL INSIDE THIS ROOM now. Charlie is holding Victor. Zoey is intently looking at her cell phone. Mary is scrutinizing Zoey:
8) 1) dialog: - Zoey, I know you’re still upset about Henry, baby. You know you can talk to me any time, right? Zoey looks up at her Mother - as if she’s going to say something when JAMES ENTERS. Zoey quickly shuts down as James announces with a slight measure of dread that he still attempts to hide:
10) 0) text: As a STEEL BARRICADE closes over the WINDOW of the DEN. The family watches it shut - sealing them in. Securing the home for some unknown reason. Bringing in darkness. Mary turns on the LIGHT. James looks at the MONITORS - at all the OTHER HOMES on the CUL-DE-SAC - and now we see ELECTRONIC SECURITY BARRICADES SECURING THESE HOMES also.
10) 20) dialog: In the oven.
10) 22) dialog: - No, hun. I’m not ready yet. Maybe next year. James nods. They share a disquieted look - both considering what’s about to happen. (CONTINUED)
14) 7) text: INT. MARY AND JAMES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT Mary’s still inside, still sitting on her bed in silence. She swigs her Martini, finishing it. She eyes the empty glass, contemplating getting another drink, when: A subtle 0.S. NOISE gets her attention. It’S LAUGHTER. A CREEPY BURST of GIGGLING - FROM OUTSIDE. Mary tenses, there’s something disconcerting about it. She gingerly moves to the WINDOW - LOOKING out the OBSERVATION SLOT, seeing: A HINT OF MOVEMENT in the FOREST BEHIND HER BACKYARD FENCE. A FLASH OF WHITE that disappears. Mary, alerted, stares out - not seeing anything now - when suddenly: AHHHHHH! An O.S. mindless SCREAM of fear ERUPTS from INSIDE her home. Mary nearly jumps out of her skin when the SCREAM is followed by BANG! The concussive SOUND of an O.S. GUNSHOT. Mary knows what it is. She freezes.
16) 5) dialog: You're a brave man, hun. You've done your duty. You OK?
16) 7) dialog: You need to see something, James.
17) 0) text: James and Mary are staring at the SECURITY MONITORS - specifically the MONITOR that DISPLAYS AN ANGLE OF THE FOREST BEHIND THEIR HOME.
17) 1) dialog: - I saw something. Right there.
17) 5) dialog: Oh, James, that poor man’s blood splashed on you. James reaches back - feels the blood on his neck. He grimaces, shocked and disturbed by it - as is Mary.
20) 0) text: James is out of the tub - clean now. Mary is helping him into a robe. They move about in pensive silence, when a sudden RUMBLE OF SOUND rises - it’s the SECURITY BARRICADE OPENING on the BATHROOM WINDOW behind them.
23) 6) dialog: Charlie - come over here. Charlie doesn’t move.
23) 14) dialog: Were you being hunted, sir? The Stranger just stares at Mary - his heavy panting breaths betray his otherwise intransigent silence.
23) 20) dialog: Are you homeless, sir?
23) 22) dialog: I’1l ask whatever I want, James. - Are you homeless, sir? The Stranger keeps staring - yielding no words - yet.
23) 36) dialog: I don’t fucking know!
23) 42) dialog: I don’t understand - where is my daughter, Henry? Why are you here?
23) 44) dialog: HENRY! Don’t come down here! Henry just glares at Mary with intense eyes. He continues to creep slowly down the circular stairs. James is still staring at the Stranger - who is now almost imperceptibly MOVING TOWARDS CHARLIE - to grab the boy as a hostage, perhaps. James is losing his cool:

24) 4) dialog: 
25) 0) text: Mary is still frantically checking James for wounds. James is breathing heavy, scared, devastated, freaked:
25) 1) dialog: You're not hit. You’re OK.
25) 3) dialog: I saw her run off. I think she’s OK. But I don’t know! I don’t know about either one of them! Mary's words hang there with pure fear. James doesn’t respond. Husband and wife suddenly grow quiet as what just happened settles in - they’re both beyond words. Mary begins trembling - James is breathing heavy. Then:
25) 5) dialog: Charlie. Come here. Are you OK? Charlie runs to his mom. She embraces him. Tight.
25) 13) dialog: - Enough! That’s not helping. (then) We can’t stay out here, James. It’s not safe. They all hold a look of dismay and fear. Too much happening at once. James takes a breath, trying to gain some semblance of rationale amidst the hysteria:
27) 0) text: WHAM! The DOOR SWINGS OPEN and JAMES, MARY AND CHARLIE enter a ROOM replete with a POOL TABLE, PINBALL MACHINE, and PING PONG TABLE. (NOTE: They’re completely unaware of what’s happening outside). James shuts the door as Charlie moves away from his devastated parents - just watching them come undone. Mary sinks into a chair - traumatized, still trembling.
27) 1) dialog: My God, my God, my God - Behind her, James is still panting and pacing back and forth - when he suddenly stops and withdraws his gun.
27) 3) dialog: 
27) 8) dialog: Hold on, for godsakes! Henry didn’t shoot at me. So I’ll go. (CONTINUED)
27) 12) dialog: We have no choice, James. Now gimme your gun, and the keys to the weapon’s cabinet. I’11 take all the weapons so he can’t get them, just in case. James reluctantly hands Mary his gun and a set of keys.
28) 0) text: As Mary exits the play room - pulling the door shut. She pauses - overwhelmed. The house is quiet around her, until BAM! BAM! LOUD RUNNING FOOTFALLS on the SECOND FLOOR. SOMEONE (Zoey, Henry, The Stranger) MOVING FAST. The SOUND nearly makes Mary jump out of her skin. Mary takes out the GUN. It’s awkward in her hand. She moves up the STAIRS - timidly. The tranquil domesticity of her bright home broken by STREAKS of BLOOD lining the floor, presumably Henry’s blood, or blood from the Stranger. She continues down the hall to:
28) 3) dialog: Zoey - Zoey - it’s me. No answer. Mary pushes open the door and sees HENRY. A bloody mess. NO SIGN OF ZOEY. Mary checks Henry’s pulse. He’s gone. Tears flow as she eyes the dead young man. (CONTINUED)
28) 7) dialog: Zoey - are you hurt - are you OK?
28) 8) dialog: ZOEY - WE CAN'T TELL WHERE SHE IS. She’s crouched in a ball - rocking back and forth - face and Catholic School Girl uniform suffused with Henry’s blood. She looks like hell - blood-drenched, emotionally devastated. She has a GUN (Henry’s GUN) in one hand - her CELL in the other. She can barely speak between heaving sobs:
28) 10) dialog: I’m so sorry, baby. Then:
28) 12) dialog: It’s not your father’s fault, Zoey. Henry tried to kill him. (CONTINUED)
28) 16) dialog: Zoey, please, calm down - you gotta listen - there’s a man in the house - tell me where you are.
28) 18) dialog: Your father loves you, Zoey. He never meant to hurt you. Now please, there’s a man, you need -—
28) 20) dialog: Oh Zoey, please listen, baby - Mary then HEARS Zoey quietly babbling to herself:
28) 22) dialog: What? What did you say, Zoey?
28) 26) dialog: Don’t say that, Zoey - you’re very upset - you don’t mean that. Please, baby, tell me where - (CONTINUED)
28) 29) dialog: Zoey - Zoey - Silence. Dead phone. Mary quickly dials - gets Zoey’s MESSAGE. PHONE OFF NOW. Mary’s panicking, trying to figure out what to do next when she HEARS: A terrifying CACOPHONY of FEROCIOUS GROWLS and BARKS. Mary moves to the WINDOW - looking THROUGH the OBSERVATION SLOT, seeing TWO NEIGHBORHOOD DOGS fighting over a SEVERED BLOODY HUMAN HEAD on the lawn of the HOME into which the GUILLOTINE was brought earlier. Mary stares at the bloody Head, horrified, and suddenly ARRGGGGHHH! She vomits! And as she releases all over her daughter’s rug, SHE DOESN'T SEE: THE MOVEMENT OUTSIDE HER HOME. It’s those SHADOWY MEN we saw running onto the cul-de-sac and surrounding the Sandin mansion. They’re still hard to see, still lurking in darkness. But ONE of THEM is standing under a POOL of STREETLIGHT, revealing himself to be: A YOUNG MAN dressed as an AMERICAN INDIAN WARRIOR, incongruously donning a CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST MASK. He’s drenched in BLOOD and holding a freshly-sliced HUMAN SCALP. Mary doesn’t notice him - she doesn’t see him eyeballing her home intensely. Mary turns away from the window, moving to the DOOR of ZOEY’S ROOM. She looks down the HALL - long, winding. The house is huge. She hears BAM! A distant NOISE in the HOUSE. She JUMPS. Startled, freaked. It could be Zoey - or the Stranger. She then SEES a DISTANT SHADOW on the STAIRCASE all the way across the HOME - THERE and THEN GONE in a FLASH. She then HEARS SOMEONE RUNNING ABOVE HER IN THE ATTIC. THEN ANOTHER ROUND of those vicious BARKS from OUTSIDE. Sensory overload of pure fear. Mary’s head is spinning - face twisted in near panic. She’s trembling - lungs rising and falling like a bellows - her eyes darting about - this housewife is losing her cool completely.
29) 4) dialog: I spoke to her. On her cell. I don’t think she’s hurt. But - Mary pauses.
29) 5) dialog: - Henry’s dead.
29) 8) dialog: James - stop. No. You can’t go look for her.
29) 10) dialog: We can’t provoke her right now - she’s out of control - she threatened to kill herself and - She stops. There’s something she doesn’t want to say.
29) 12) dialog: She said she wished you were dead. It was almost like a threat. Stillpoint. James physically retracts as if punched in the face by that statement. He stands absolutely shell- shocked. All he manages to say is: (CONTINUED)
29) 16) dialog: I don’t know, James. We just need to give her time to calm down. James can’t move - he’s agape - still processing what Mary’s told him - shaking his head in stunned, devastated disbelief. After a beat, he takes a breath - trying hard to stay cool in the wake of what he just heard:
29) 18) dialog: I know, James - I don’t know what the hell to do anymore! As the desperate, terrified Sandin Parents try to figure out their next move, Charlie has noticed something - a subtle, muffled SOUND RISING 0.S. - barely perceptible.
29) 20) dialog: (re: The Stranger) Maybe he just wants to hide. Again:
29) 28) dialog: Hear what, Charlie? I don’t - And then, as if on cue, the 0.S. SOUND RISES again - it’s clear this time - a DISTANT YOUNG MAN’S POLITE VOICE - TALKING THROUGH A BULLHORN - in the near distance:
29) 35) dialog: Oh my God. They're collectively agape. They all look out again and this time WE SEE WHAT’S GOT THEM SO SPOOKED: MARY’S, JAMES’ AND CHARLIE’S POV THROUGH OBSERVATION
29) 43) dialog: No. Then - adding to their panic: THE LIGHTS GO OUT. They’re thrust into eerie darkness. A mere sliver of exterior moonlight finding entry through the OBSERVATION SLOTS grants them minimal vision. James moves to the DOOR - peers out into the HALL - sees the LIGHTS are OFF in the REST of the HOME also. Everything’s happening fast now - fear rising rapidly:
29) 46) dialog: Who? That lunatic outside. How?
29) 48) dialog: Can they really get through our security, James?
29) 50) dialog: ‘Hard to say’. For godsakes, you sell this equipment, James! (CONTINUED)
29) 53) dialog: 
29) 61) dialog: What about Zoey? I don’t know what she’ll do if she sees you right now, James. But I can’t find this man alone. No fucking way.
30) 0) text: MARY - holding that flashlight - moving slowly down a dark hall, absolutely terrified. She has her gun up and out. She is clearly looking for the Stranger. The big search, through her once peaceful home, is underway. She comes upon a DOOR. Slowly opens it, wary, shining her light within - illuminating: A DEAD BODY - at first we don’t know who it is - then we realize its MR. KANE. HIS FACE BLUE, SWOLLEN. ONE GUNSHOT in his HEAD, ONE in his CHEST. Mary stares, unnerved. She closes the door.
33) 0) text: MARY ascends a BACK STAIRCASE now - moving to the SECOND FLOOR. The house is disturbingly quiet. She turns down the HALL and enters her: BEDROOM. As Mary's flashlight sweeps the room, she doesn’t see: (CONTINUED)
35) 0) text: Mary moves in - flashlight sweeping - finding nothing. She turns to exit, when she HEARS something OUTSIDE. She peers through the WINDOW’S OBSERVATION SLOT, spotting TWO ARMED FREAKS in her BACKYARD - ON GUARD. She then sees SOMETHING ELSE that grabs her attention: MOVEMENT behind her BACKYARD FENCE AGAIN. Ten yards BEHIND the Freaks. In the forest - right where she saw movement earlier. This time she sees what it is: TWO OTHER PEOPLE - BOTH WEARING SMILEY FACE MASKS (just like the Person we saw earlier on the security monitor) standing in the FOREST BEHIND HER YARD. These Smiley Masked People are LOOKING RIGHT AT MARY. The Armed Freaks are unaware of them. The Masked People WAVE HELLO to Mary and then run off. Mary watches them go, confused, even more terrified. She turns from the window, eyes landing on a LARGE STEAK KNIFE lying on the kitchen counter. Mary can’t help herself - she grabs it before exiting.
46) 6) dialog: FOOTSTEPS. YELLING. SHADOWS. LIGHT. CHAOS. THEN -—
46) 9) dialog: Are you OK, Charlie? Charlie nods. Mary's flashlight beam then finds: ZOEY - on the ground, unconscious, head bleeding. Mary moves to her - checks her for gunshot wounds:
46) 10) dialog: Zoey! She’s unconscious. Christ. And then:
46) 12) dialog: Mary whips the FLASHLIGHT - finding: JAMES standing center hall - out of breath - not hurt. Her face tightens with utter shock when she sees that James is pointing his GUN downward at: (CONTINUED)
47) 0) text: LIT by a few CANDLES. ZOEY’S on a couch, still unconscious. CHARLIE’S next to ZOEY - the young boy looks horrified as he stares at: JAMES and MARY - who have dragged the BLOODY SCALPED SHOT STRANGER into this room and are now in the midst of trying to secure him to a DESK CHAIR so they can deliver him (roll him out) to the Freaks. But the Stranger (gagged, limbs bound with duct tape) is not making it easy - he’s fighting like a rabid dog as the Sandins cruelly and clumsily attempt to roll him INTO the CHAIR which is lying on its side (to accommodate the Stranger’s forced entry into it). It's pure chaos - the wealthy suburban Sandins are bruised, sweating, screaming, as they struggle furiously with the Stranger - his blood flying all over them.
47) 1) dialog: Push, Mary, before he He’s too strong. I’m so breaks the rope again - sorry sir.
47) 3) dialog: (panting) Charlie - pay attention to your sister. Is she waking up yet? Charlie looks down - Zoey’s still out cold - when: (CONTINUED)
47) 8) dialog: What a fucking nightmare. Then:
47) 13) dialog: What? Why? Oh my god. I can’t.
47) 16) dialog: Jesus Christ, this poor man. What are we doing to him?
47) 27) dialog: No. I can’t. I can’t do this. I can’t do this anymore. (CONTINUED)
47) 31) dialog: No. I just can’t. Oh my God. It's fucking wrong! Now James is on his feet - seeing his wife’s emotions disintegrating:
47) 33) dialog: Stop saying that! Look at us, James. Look at Zoey. Look at this poor man. And Henry. And Mr. Kane. We’re covered in blood, James. It’s fucking everywhere! James moves to Mary - tries to grab her arm to calm her:
47) 35) dialog: Don’t touch me, James. NO! What the hell happened to us? LOOK AT US! WE’RE COVERED IN BLOOD! Mary's intensity silences James. They hold a long look, when, breaking the MOMENT:
47) 41) dialog: Oh my God. Charlie. Where did you go, baby? Where did you go? Desperate, terrified, Mary looks at her husband. James just stares back at her, equally as overwhelmed. Mary starts moving toward the door - calling out:

50) 1) dialog: - James? Where’s Zoey? Why are you bleeding? Then, quietly:
50) 3) dialog: I don’t know where he is. James absorbs that - his family has come undone - torn apart by the night. He stands there, destroyed, like a man who’s lost faith in everything he’s ever believed.
50) 4) dialog: (hopeless) Our children are gone, James. And those Freaks are coming in now. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
50) 7) dialog: They brought trucks - they’re gonna pull off the security doors and come inside. (then, re: the Stranger) Maybe you were right - maybe we don’t have a choice. Fatalistic beat. James staring at his wife. Two desperate people. James’ expression slowly tightens - an idea is clearly forming. He then says:

50) 15) dialog: - I don’t understand. What are you gonna do, James? How will you stop them? (CONTINUED)

51) 11) dialog: I know, baby. I hope he - Mary stops - HEARING another SOUND - this one closer - a BANGING on the DOOR that leads to the BASEMENT. Her face suddenly falls with grim realization.
51) 12) dialog: No.
51) 14) dialog: Stay here, baby. Do not move. Charlie, baffled, watches his MOTHER take off - she’s running toward the stairs - something’s clearly up.
51) 19) dialog: Goddamn you, James. This is not the way!
51) 40) dialog: Oh my god, James. What were you doing, baby? James’ distraught face bristles with regret as he says:

AN ARM SHOOTS THROUGH THE GLASS - SHATTERING IT and GRABBING MARY! SHE SCREAMS - SPINNING and FIRING - BLASTING THE FREAK in the CHEST. The Freak drops and then WHAM! Another ARM ENTERS THE FRAME - YANKING MARY’S SHOTGUN AWAY. It's the POLITE LEADER this time - snarling with uber- courteousness:
51) 81) dialog: James — He turns - seeing MARY running over to him:
51) 83) dialog: I did.
51) 86) dialog: Come here, baby. Come here. Charlie joins his Mom - leaning over the dying James:
51) 91) dialog: 
51) 97) dialog: Go to the basement. There’s no windows there and one door which we can safe-guard. Charlie nods through tears. Zoey’s still weeping uncontrollably - a basket case.
51) 98) dialog: Zoey - I need you to pull it together now. Take your brother to the basement. Can you do that? Zoey Manages a nod.
51) 99) dialog: Good. Go now. I’1l be down ina minute - I need to find some ammunition up here - just in case. Mary kisses her children. Zoey takes her brother's hand and they move off. Mary alone with James. She gently closes his eyes before running off into darkness.

52) 3) dialog: Who are you? They don’t answer - both proceeding menacingly - guns up. Mary’s eyes land on a NEARBY ROOM - just a YARD AWAY - and, suddenly, as the Smileys close in, Mary MAKES HER MOVE. WHOOSH! BURSTING into this ADJACENT ROOM! POP! POP! TWO GUNSHOTS RING OUT - just missing her. Mary crosses that ROOM - exiting into a HALL. THE SMILEYS are hauling ass after her as MARY finds the:

53) 33) dialog: Anybody else want some? YOU? Mr. Sabian? Mrs. Halverson? I’M NOT FUCKING AROUND! C’MON! The Neighbors are speechless. Mrs. Ferrin is bleeding, crying, on the ground. Charlie and Zoey are staring at MARY and THE STRANGER - thankful but shocked, as:
53) 34) dialog: Everyone drop your weapons. Zoey, Charlie - over here. The Neighbors drop their guns as Zoey and Charlie stand with the help of the Stranger and move behind Mary - who removes their gags. Then:

53) 41) dialog: It doesn’t matter. There’1ll be no more killing tonight. And that statement hangs there. Zoey and her Mother holding a look when the bleeding Mrs. Ferrin makes another quick move for a nearby GUN. BAM! Mary SHOOTS Mrs. Ferrin in the OTHER LEG - YELLING:
53) 42) dialog: ENOUGH! No one is killing anyone anymore. Did you not hear what I said, Mrs. Ferrin? Mrs. Ferrin is writhing in pain now - from two bullet wounds. Mary is a wild-eyed beast:

MARY, covered in blood, sits at the HEAD of the table. CHARLIE and ZOEY are next to her. Also veiled in blood. Charlie is still wearing the layers of clothes - he is also donning his odd GLASSES and playing with the REMOTE. The BLOODY STRANGER stands behind everyone (his wounds also bandaged) - he’s covering the Neighbors with his gun. He’s cleaned up and standing tall - he looks like an absolute bad ass - the soldier he used to be. The NEIGHBORS all have their heads down, EATING a big, nearly gourmet BREAKFAST of OMELETTES, PANCAKES, FRENCH TOAST, POTATOES, BACON, CEREAL, FRUIT, etc. (CONTINUED)
54) 3) dialog: How’s the French Toast, Mr. Halverson? Everyone looks at Mr. Halverson. He mumbles something.
54) 4) dialog: I can’t hear you, Mr. Halverson.
54) 6) dialog: Thank you. I appreciate that. Everyone goes back to eating. The macabre dinner party continuing in awkward silence - when we HEAR WHUMP WHUMP WHUMP as Charlie (using his remote) steers VICTOR (with the shirt still wrapped around his eyes) into the room. Charlie puts Victor on the table. Everyone looks at the RABBIT curiously before going back to eating. Mary then raises the TV/INTERNET REMOTE and flicks on the PROJECTION in the DINING ROOM. Everyone’s looking at her as she types on the remote keyboard - searching for a specific site - just as she did earlier. And just like last time, as she types we begin to HEAR a BEEPING. Mary (and everyone else) looks at the PROJECTION, seeing:
54) 13) dialog: Lower your weapon. It’s over. The Stranger lowers his weapon. Mary does the same.
54) 14) dialog: (to the Neighbors) Now get the hell out of my house. The Neighbors begin filing out.
54) 15) dialog: Wait, Mrs. Ferrin. Mrs. Ferrin looks back at Mary.
54) 16) dialog: You're cookies tasted like the inside of a cow’s ass. The shell-shocked Neighbors, including Mrs. Ferrin, continue on, down the hall, exiting. BEHIND THEM: Charlie, Zoey, Mary and the Stranger are left alone now. The Stranger breaks the moment, laying his gun down. He casts one last look on the family before walking off.
54) 17) dialog: Excuse me. The Stranger pauses, looks back.
54) 18) dialog: Thank you. The Stranger nods - then looks at Charlie. He reaches up and removes his NECKLACE - his ARMY DOG TAGS. He flips them to the Charlie, who catches them.
54) 24) dialog: Why didn’t you tell us any of this when you first came in?
54) 26) dialog: What will happen to you? The Stranger peers over at the TV - sees CARMELO bleeding out. The Stranger looks back at the Sandins:
54) 28) dialog: I don’t know. (peering around at her bullet-ridden home ) I just know I can’t be here right now. Another look between Mary and the Stranger. He nods to her - a signal - ‘follow me’. The Stranger starts walking out. Mary takes a beat, then stands, and says: (CONTINUED)
54) 31) dialog: Kids. Zoey and Charlie exchange a confused look. They both finally rise, following their Mother as she starts out, behind the The Stranger.
55) 0) text: As the FRONT DOOR OPENS and THE STRANGER steps out - quickly followed by MARY, ZOEY, and CHARLIE (holding Victor). They’re all squinting from the intense, nearly blinding morning sunlight. They immediately see: DEAD FREAKS peppering their lawn; HOMELESS PEOPLE hanging from light poles; THE NEIGHBORHOOD MUTT carrying the DECAPITATED HUMAN HEAD in its teeth. The opulent cul-de-sac looks very different this morning. The Stranger considers the carnage then starts walking. Mary looks at her Children - they all seem a bit perplexed by what they’re doing - but they all start forward, following this Stranger, joining him as he walks down the middle of the street, away from the cul-de-sac. As they walk, Mary looks up at: SKY-BOARDS peppering the sky - MOST PURGE PARTICIPANTS -
55) 4) dialog: We’re gonna be OK, guys. Somehow we'll be OK. She takes her children’s hands in her own, and the remaining Sandins and the Bloody Stranger continue onward - leaving the cul-de-sac behind as the CAMERA RISES INTO THE SKY watching this bloodied, but very alive foursome walking off, together, into the hot morning sunrise. FADE TO RED.
