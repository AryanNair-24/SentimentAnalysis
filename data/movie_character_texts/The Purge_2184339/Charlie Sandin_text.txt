1) 0) text: A LONG HALL decorated with PHOTOS of the attractive SANDINS - JAMES, MARY, ZOEY and CHARLIE. We notice something at the end of this corridor - it’s a foot high moving toward us. As it draws near, we see that it’s: A RABBIT - hopping through the home. And it’s a strange Rabbit, indeed. Its fur is green and white and weathered terribly. It’s also missing its RIGHT EAR. It’s an incongruous image - the weathered Rabbit hopping through the pristine Sandin HALLS, until it comes upon: MARY SANDIN (wearing a robe now) - IN THE KITCHEN -— standing in front of the OPEN REFRIGERATOR - eating some CAKE with great fervor. After a beat, Mary spots the Rabbit. She smirks, then oddly talks to the bunny:
1) 3) text: BOXES piled in the corner - BOY’S CLOTHES hanging. It’s a CLOSET that’s been turned into a secret hiding spot - replete with a TOYS, BOOKS, DRAWINGS, as well as CANDID PHOTOS of the SANDINS - MARY, JAMES and ZOEY (NOTE: no PHOTOS of CHARLIE). We FIND: YOUNG CHARLIE SANDIN - sitting on a small CHAIR in this, his secret getaway. (NOTE: This is clearly the back of Charlie's closet - into which he disappeared earlier.) Charlie’s not only wearing those multiple LAYERS OF CLOTHES, but he’s also now donning a bizarre pair of SMALL, CIRCULAR DARK GLASSES/GOGGLES - as well as holding an I-POD NANO-LIKE DEVICE which he handles expertly. WE HOLD ON CHARLIE - in those dark GLASSES/GOGGLES, seemingly staring off at nothing until we SEE what he’s
1) 8) dialog: Come in. The DOOR OPENS - MARY enters - cradling the Rabbit. She places it on the dresser and then PLUGS a CORD into a SLOT in its BACK while Charlie presses the I-Pod-like device, HIGHLIGHTING a COMMAND - SLEEP MODE - causing: THE RABBIT to close its eyes. And we realize that the Rabbit is just an ultra-realistic remote-controlled stuffed animal of tomorrow-land. As the Rabbit ‘sleeps’, Mary sits next to Charlie on the bed. (CONTINUED)
1) 11) dialog: Slight deviation in my temperature. Otherwise good. (then) I heard that scratching again late last night. (gestures toward the weathered Rabbit) I had Victor explore the whole house - we didn’t find anything.
1) 13) dialog: I think Daddy’s wrong. They share a smile. Beat as Mary curiously notes the way Charlie HOLDS the COVERS over his BODY.
1) 15) dialog: Don’t tell Daddy. Mary grins warmly at her red-faced son:
6) 0) text: The attractive Sandin Family sits at the kitchen table, ready to eat dinner, all holding hands for some kind of prayer/thanks. Victor, Charlie’s rabbit, sits on the table next to him. They all have their eyes closed, except Charlie, who’s secretly peering at everyone.
6) 9) dialog: Congratulations! So proud of you, baby. Way to go, Dad. James can’t stop smiling.
6) 11) dialog: What are you gonna do with a big boat, Mom? Mary goes to respond but her mouth yields nothing. She seems unable to answer. Confused by her own silence, she looks at James, who helps her:
6) 14) dialog: We studied the history of the Purge in History. And I wrote a story in English about a man who invents a spray that allows you to see offensive smells. Like farts. (then) And Daddy’s breath. (CONTINUED)
6) 21) dialog: Mommy’s turn.
8) 0) text: A ROOM with a BANK OF 12 HI-TECH COMPUTER SCREENS - SET UP LIKE SECURITY MONITORS ON A WALL. They are not on. MARY, ZOEY AND CHARLIE are ALL INSIDE THIS ROOM now. Charlie is holding Victor. Zoey is intently looking at her cell phone. Mary is scrutinizing Zoey:
10) 17) dialog: That's OK. Good night. Charlie happily walks out. Zoey steps forward:
11) 5) dialog: Ready for our secret mission, Vic? Young Charlie smirks slyly. He’s up to something.
14) 13) text: INT. CHARLIE’S SECRET LAIR - SAME Charlie stands frozen - in the midst of putting on a THIRD T-SHIRT. He has clearly just heard the TWO GUNSHOTS. He waits for another - but it never comes.
18) 0) text: Where the RABBIT sits unmoving behind the basement door. The BLOOD that runs under the door stains Victor’s fur. We HEAR FOOTSTEPS O.S. as CHARLIE suddenly appears at the base of the STAIRS behind Victor, out of breath. He runs up beside his Rabbit - joining it behind that DOOR. He stares down at the red puddle pooling on the floor. Charlie clearly had to see the blood in person. Charlie lifts the floor mat - finds the KEY. He pauses, terrified. He finally musters up the gumption to: UNLOCK AND OPEN THAT DOOR. Charlie pauses - staring into the room - at the 0.S. dead Mr. Kane. We don’t see what Charlie sees. But we see the color drain from his soft face. Charlie finally closes the door. He stands there next to his Rabbit, horrified by what he’s seen. Young Charlie is unable to move.
19) 0) text: Charlie is walking through the home now, devastated from viewing MR. KANE’S CORPSE. His Rabbit is not with him. He continues on, when he HEARS an O.S. protracted SOUND. He takes note. Walking onward - through the barricaded home - when he HEARS THAT SOUND AGAIN. It’s a SCREAM. A MAN’S SCREAM. From OUTSIDE. Charlie WALKS to a WINDOW - peers out the OBSERVATION SLOT. CHARLIE’S POV OF THE STREET: Charlie peers around the neighborhood, when he SPOTS: A DISTANT FIGURE - RUNNING toward the CUL-DE-SAC. The DISTANT FIGURE IS STUMBLING and YELLING in fear/pain. Charlie stares at this RUNNING FIGURE. As ‘it’ draws CLOSER, we can see that it is a TALL MAN - with streaks of FRESH BLOOD striating his entire body. He’s running forward but looking back. He’s clearly being HUNTED. Charlie looks down the street - DOESN’T SEE THE PURSUERS. HOLD ON CHARLIE’S FACE for a long beat - twisted in concern and empathy as he watches this desperate, bloody man stumbling down the CUL-DE-SAC. SUDDENLY: Charlie SPINS AND SPRINTS across his HOME. WE FOLLOW HIM DOWN A HALL. Up a flight of STAIRS. Through the KITCHEN. Down another HALL. And into THE DEN/SECURITY ROOM. He peers at the SECURITY MONITORS - sees that BLOODY MAN still struggling down the street. Charlie doesn’t hesitate - WHAM! HE HITS THE RED SECURITY BARRICADE BUTTON ON THE WALL.
21) 0) text: A RUSH OF MOVEMENT as CHARLIE RUNS BACK DOWN the STAIRS - to the FIRST FLOOR. He screeches to a halt by the FRONT DOOR. He UNLOCKS THE DOOR - WHIPS IT OPEN - SECURITY GATE in front of it almost OPEN and EXPOSING THE OUTSIDE. Charlie sees the BLOODY RUNNING STRANGER - 20 yards away. Up close, the MAN is tall, with tattered blood-soaked clothes. Beard dirty, hair matted - like a Homeless Man. He’s between 30-35 - his torn shirt reveals a hideously SCARRED BODY - including one scar that jack-knifes across his face, ending at his right eye - which is just a dark hole where his eye used to reside. He is also missing part of his scalp - hair and skin cut from his head, exposing bloody subcutaneous tissue. Unlike his other scars, this scalp wound is fresh. There’s also a LONG RUSTY SERRATED KNIFE sticking out of the Stranger’s pocket conspicuously. Charlie, undaunted by the Man’s grisly appearance, YELLS:
21) 1) dialog: Hey - hey - come here! BLOODY STRANGER spots CHARLIE - a beacon. He PIVOTS TOWARD THE SANDIN HOME. Climbing the IRON GATE that SURROUNDS the PROPERTY. Charlie looks - but still can’t see the MAN’S ATTACKERS.
23) 0) text: Charlie stands under the threshold of the front door. The Bloody Stranger just TEN FEET AWAY NOW. The SECURITY DOOR between them is NOW CLOSING. IN TWO MORE SECONDS the BLOODY STRANGER won't be able to enter.
23) 1) dialog: Come on! (CONTINUED)
23) 8) dialog: No. He needed help. James stares at Charlie, flabbergasted. The gruesome Stranger is standing very still - breathing hard - staring at everyone with that uncompromising intensity.
23) 10) dialog: He would’ve died.
23) 16) dialog: Why? He’s hurt.
23) 18) dialog: He was running from someone. I saw him. He needs help. He -
23) 24) dialog: He’1l die out there!
23) 29) dialog: No. James glaring at his son - Charlie staring back defiantly. The Bloody Stranger surveilling the Sandins and all the nearby hallways as:
23) 34) dialog: (re: the Stranger) - Just lock him in the basement, Dad, let him stay.
23) 47) dialog: (re: The Stranger) Dad, you have to let him stay! The Stranger and James are still locked on each other - and The Stranger’s still slowly stepping toward Charlie.
25) 4) dialog: Mom. That snaps the Sandin parents out of their mutual fugue - both turn toward CHARLIE’S VOICE - finding the BOY in the CORNER of the FOYER - behind FURNITURE:
25) 6) dialog: What just happened, Mom? What was Henry doing? (CONTINUED)
25) 11) dialog: I don’t know. Mary and James’ faces fall with alarm. Mary’s looking around - there’s no sign of the Bloody Stranger anywhere.
27) 0) text: WHAM! The DOOR SWINGS OPEN and JAMES, MARY AND CHARLIE enter a ROOM replete with a POOL TABLE, PINBALL MACHINE, and PING PONG TABLE. (NOTE: They’re completely unaware of what’s happening outside). James shuts the door as Charlie moves away from his devastated parents - just watching them come undone. Mary sinks into a chair - traumatized, still trembling.
29) 19) dialog: Did you guys hear that? But James and Mary aren’t paying attention:
29) 21) dialog: Did you guys hear that noise? Mom and Dad are still not listening:
29) 23) dialog: 
29) 27) dialog: Stop talking. Do you hear that?
29) 31) dialog: That. Did you hear that? Mary and James heard it too now. Before they could react:
29) 44) dialog: Why did the lights go out?
29) 57) dialog: But they’11 kill him!
29) 59) dialog: But he didn’t do anything to us. Why should he die?
32) 0) text: A SINGLE SHAFT of LIGHT illuminates YOUNG CHARLIE’S TERRIFIED FACE - which seems to be hovering in darkness. Charlie sits alone, holding a gun in his lap and a flashlight up to his own face. He has obviously been told to stay put. He has also switched his WATCH to MEDICAL MONITOR-MODE as WE HEAR the RHYTHMIC BEEP BEEP BEEP of his PULSE - filling the silence like a metronome in the dark. Suddenly, Charlie HEARS an unnerving CREAK - right outside the room - he tenses, shines the LIGHT and SEES THE DOOR HANDLE/KNOB SLOWLY TURNING. Someone is trying to come inside. The rhythmic BEEPING QUICKENS - his heart rate rising - 85,86,87. KNOB still turning. HEART MONITOR BEEPING. Charlie hits a button, turning his watch to CLOCK MODE - silencing the BEEPS - afraid it’s giving away his position. Quiet now as the DOOR KNOB keeps TURNING, then, BAM! An O.S. NOISE followed by FOOTSTEPS. Is the person gone? We HOLD on CHARLIE’S FACE when his expression tightens - an idea. He reaches in his pocket - finding THE REMOTE CONTROL FOR HIS RABBIT and HI-TECH GLASSES.
34) 5) dialog: Staring at the Bloody Stranger on the MINI-SCREENS. The Stranger unaware.
37) 0) text: Charlie’s staring at the STRANGER - on the MINI SCREENS. He’s clearly up to something. The Boy presses a button on the remote and: THE RABBIT’S EYES ILLUMINATE - flashing RED - announcing its presence to the Stranger for some reason. The Stranger, alerted, raises his knife and crawls toward the RABBIT now. CHARLIE holds steady - the man’s taut scarred face looming large inside Charlie’s GLASSES’ MINI SCREENS. The Stranger stares hard at the Rabbit - seeing it up close. After a beat, The Stranger dismisses the toy, and starts moving away when the RABBIT’S EYES FLASH AGAIN. THE STRANGER pauses. Something about the Rabbit and its clear attempt at communication has his curiosity piqued. The Stranger waits for more as Charlie works the remote, moving Victor forward now. The Stranger remaining behind, just watching the Rabbit, considering it. The Rabbit pauses - looks back at the Stranger - flashes its eyes one more time. A signal - ‘follow me’. The Rabbit then hops forward. After a beat, the Scalped Man takes the cue - he begins FOLLOWING the green Rabbit.
39) 1) dialog: Steering the Rabbit and taking the Stranger in a specific direction. Together, this incongruous duo moves through HALLS, ROOMS, STAIRS, finally coming upon: CHARLIE’S BEDROOM. The Rabbit enters and moves into: THE CLOSET - through hanging clothes. The Stranger follows the Rabbit inside, finding: (CONTINUED)
39) 4) dialog: Sees the Stranger ‘winking’ at him on the MINI-SCREENS. THE RABBIT flashes its eyes one last time, before exiting the closet, leaving the Stranger alone, hidden. THE RABBIT takes post in Charlie’s room - standing guard.
39) 5) dialog: Takes a breath, relieved, happy the Stranger’s tucked away and safe - his mission accomplished.
41) 0) text: Charlie sits center room, with his glasses on, still looking at the world through Victor the Rabbit’s eyes. CHARLIE’S POV - OF MINI-SCREENS - THROUGH VICTOR’S EYES: Of his own ROOM. The Rabbit is still standing guard. All is quiet until WHAM! A FACE SUDDENLY POPS UP IN CHARLIE’S MINI-SCREENS - SO CLOSE AND DRENCHED IN BLOOD! CHARLIE JUMPS! SOMEONE IS AN INCH AWAY FROM VICTOR and STARING RIGHT IN THE RABBIT’S EYES - RIGHT AT CHARLIE! Terrified, Charlie gets his bearings, seeing that it’s: ZOEY - staring at Victor - her gaze distant, foggy, destroyed, lost. She’s holding Henry’s GUN and babbling:
42) 0) text: James is frantically searching for the Stranger when he HEARS a O.S. NOISE - down the hall. Muffled SCREAMS - SOUNDS of STRUGGLE - the same sounds Charlie just heard. James journeys toward the sounds - which bring him to: INT. CHARLIE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS As James enters - finger on the trigger - flashlight covers the room, and to James’ utter surprise it unexpectedly illuminates: THE BLOODY STRANGER - in front of the closet now. James freezes, startled, excited that he’s found the Stranger - he targets him with his gun, when the Stranger speaks - for only the second time - his raspy whisper:
43) 0) text: Charlie is sitting terrified in the darkness - the distant O.S. YELLS of his FATHER reaching him.
45) 0) text: Charlie sits frozen in the darkness - the 0.S. SHOUTING between James and the Stranger is RISING. The young boy can’t take it any longer - he suddenly STANDS and RUNS FOR THE DOOR.
47) 0) text: LIT by a few CANDLES. ZOEY’S on a couch, still unconscious. CHARLIE’S next to ZOEY - the young boy looks horrified as he stares at: JAMES and MARY - who have dragged the BLOODY SCALPED SHOT STRANGER into this room and are now in the midst of trying to secure him to a DESK CHAIR so they can deliver him (roll him out) to the Freaks. But the Stranger (gagged, limbs bound with duct tape) is not making it easy - he’s fighting like a rabid dog as the Sandins cruelly and clumsily attempt to roll him INTO the CHAIR which is lying on its side (to accommodate the Stranger’s forced entry into it). It's pure chaos - the wealthy suburban Sandins are bruised, sweating, screaming, as they struggle furiously with the Stranger - his blood flying all over them.
47) 2) dialog: (re: The Stranger, devastated) He’s bleeding so much. Can you at least stop his bleeding?
47) 15) dialog: No, Mom. Please. Don’t. Mary can’t stop shaking her head in stunned disbelief:
47) 20) dialog: WILLINGLY?!? WE’RE GOING TO KILL
47) 25) dialog: He was a soldier. Mary looks up at Charlie, baffled by that. Charlie points - indicating a MEDALLION on a NECKLACE hanging from the STRANGER’S NECK. It bears a U.S. MILITARY LOGO.
47) 26) dialog: A marine. He fought in the Ten Year War. That’s his dog tags. That's who we’re going to kill. Mary considers the Stranger’s dog tags. Tears begin welling up. She looks at her son - who admonishes his mother with a disgusted look of pure disappointment. Mary looks like she’s going to pass out. Something’s happening to her. She’s trembling, shaking her head uncontrollably, when suddenly:
47) 43) dialog: She exits in a burst, leaving James alone with Zoey and the Stranger now - that MYSTERIOUS RUMBLING SOUND rising all around him.
50) 0) text: As James stands in the hall in front of the closed door - behind which is the Stranger. James is motionless, lost, when he sees: MARY - moving quickly down the hall towards him. Charlie is conspicuously NOT with her.
50) 12) dialog: What are you going to do? They both turn - seeing Charlie - he’s been hiding nearby, in the dark, spying and listening - as he always does. He’s approaching his parents now - rejoining his family as he’s heard what James just said. Mary slumps - so relieved to her son.
51) 0) text: A FLASHLIGHT BEAM dances through dark. In the minimal light we see CHARLIE AND MARY - running hand in hand.
51) 4) dialog: What’s Daddy gonna do?
51) 10) dialog: Whatever Daddy’s doing, I hope he does it fast.
51) 13) dialog: What?
51) 56) dialog: ALSO HEARS the SOUND OF an O.S. WINDOW BREAKING. The Young boy is seized by terror when he SPOTS SOMETHING 0.S - across the room - he seems very interested in it. We REVERSE TO REVEAL what it is: A LAUNDRY BASKET filled with CLOTHES. Charlie’s clothes.
51) 65) dialog: Charlie is locked in panic - not hearing anything. JAMES, bleeding from three arrow wounds, musters up every last bit of strength and STANDS - STAGGERING across the ROOM in a rush of challenged movement. And just as that FREAK TARGETS CHARLIE - James tackles his son - driving him hard to the floor - atop shards of broken glass from a blown-out window - saving him.
51) 69) dialog: I’m OK, Dad. But you’re hurt.
51) 71) dialog: I can help, Dad. I'’11 help fight.
51) 85) dialog: Mom — Mary looks up, sees Charlie entering from the kitchen:
51) 87) dialog: Is Daddy gonna be OK? Mary looks at her son - shakes her head - ‘no, he’s not’. Charlie’s eyes fill with tears. (CONTINUED)
51) 90) dialog: Zoey — James and Mary see Charlie’s fright - they follow his gaze, turning and spotting: ZOEY - emerging from the SHADOWS - she’s leaning over a DEAD FREAK (NOTE: The Apache) - taking a GUN from him. She raises the WEAPON - seemingly TARGETING HER FAMILY.
51) 101) dialog: As brother and sister run down the STAIRS hand in hand. They reach bottom - into the BASEMENT HALL. They wait outside the TWO ROOMS that debouch off the hallway.
51) 103) dialog: Still standing in the hall, still holding hands.
51) 104) dialog: What’s taking Mommy so long? Zoey looks at her scared little brother and leans down and pulls him in tight - hugging him. He accepts her embrace. Neither of them see:
51) 106) dialog: How did you get in here? There’s no way in here. WHO ARE YOU? YOU
51) 110) text: Get the Parents. Zoey and Charlie watch TWO SMILEY FACE MASKED PEOPLE GOING UP THE STAIRS - toward the main part of the house.
53) 0) text: A FLURRY of FURIOUS MOVEMENT as about 6 SMILEY FACE MASKED PEOPLE tie up ZOEY and CHARLIE on the FLOOR. The Children are flopping around desperately, trying to break free from their quiet Happy Faced captors.
53) 1) dialog: 
53) 4) dialog: (to their captors) Why are you doing this? Why? Who are you? How did you get in here? No answers - just all those SMILEY FACES hovering above them silently - securing their FEET and HANDS viciously:
53) 11) dialog: Mr. Halverson - what are -— NEXT TO MR. HALVERSON are his OVERWEIGHT WIFE and his
53) 13) dialog: Mr. Ramage. Mr. Cali. Susie, Kenny. I don’t understand. Why? The Neighbors just stare at the Sandin children blankly.
53) 17) dialog: Why? Why?
53) 22) dialog: Tell me how you got in here. (looking toward the back of the room) There’s no way in from back there. There’s no -— Charlie stops - seeing something in the REAR of the ROOM DIRT/MUD all over the FLOOR behind some MACHINERY.
53) 23) dialog: (realization) You dug a tunnel. Are you crazy?
53) 25) dialog: That was the scratching, Zoey. Daddy thought it was a raccoon. That brings a SMILE to Mrs. Ferrin’s face. To all the Neighbors’ faces. They all start LAUGHING. Zoey and Charlie stare up at them, their tanned faces contorted in laughter. It finally wanes and the Neighbors begin shackling and gagging the children again.
54) 0) text: All the NEIGHBORS, all alive, all now SEATED around the SANDIN DINING ROOM TABLE, including a whimpering Mrs. Ferrin whose bullet wounds are bandaged. MARY, covered in blood, sits at the HEAD of the table. CHARLIE and ZOEY are next to her. Also veiled in blood. Charlie is still wearing the layers of clothes - he is also donning his odd GLASSES and playing with the REMOTE. The BLOODY STRANGER stands behind everyone (his wounds also bandaged) - he’s covering the Neighbors with his gun. He’s cleaned up and standing tall - he looks like an absolute bad ass - the soldier he used to be. The NEIGHBORS all have their heads down, EATING a big, nearly gourmet BREAKFAST of OMELETTES, PANCAKES, FRENCH TOAST, POTATOES, BACON, CEREAL, FRUIT, etc. (CONTINUED)

55) 0) text: As the FRONT DOOR OPENS and THE STRANGER steps out - quickly followed by MARY, ZOEY, and CHARLIE (holding Victor). They’re all squinting from the intense, nearly blinding morning sunlight. They immediately see: DEAD FREAKS peppering their lawn; HOMELESS PEOPLE hanging from light poles; THE NEIGHBORHOOD MUTT carrying the DECAPITATED HUMAN HEAD in its teeth. The opulent cul-de-sac looks very different this morning. The Stranger considers the carnage then starts walking. Mary looks at her Children - they all seem a bit perplexed by what they’re doing - but they all start forward, following this Stranger, joining him as he walks down the middle of the street, away from the cul-de-sac. As they walk, Mary looks up at: SKY-BOARDS peppering the sky - MOST PURGE PARTICIPANTS -
