Zoey and Henry stop kissing - staring deeply at each other - young love in full obsessive melodramatic bloom.
0) 21) dialog: God, I love you too much. (CONTINUED)
0) 24) dialog: I thank God every day that you’re in my life. But you should go. All hell will break loose if he sees you here now. One last kiss - Henry then moves to the window and climbs out, onto the balcony, disappearing below. WE STAY WITH ZOEY - beaming with young love, when her eyes fall on that WALL of TROPHIES and PLAQUES and PHOTOS of HERSELF at PIANO RECITALS, BEAUTY CONTESTS, etc. She stares at all of it - her bright smile fading.
1) 0) text: A LONG HALL decorated with PHOTOS of the attractive SANDINS - JAMES, MARY, ZOEY and CHARLIE. We notice something at the end of this corridor - it’s a foot high moving toward us. As it draws near, we see that it’s: A RABBIT - hopping through the home. And it’s a strange Rabbit, indeed. Its fur is green and white and weathered terribly. It’s also missing its RIGHT EAR. It’s an incongruous image - the weathered Rabbit hopping through the pristine Sandin HALLS, until it comes upon: MARY SANDIN (wearing a robe now) - IN THE KITCHEN -— standing in front of the OPEN REFRIGERATOR - eating some CAKE with great fervor. After a beat, Mary spots the Rabbit. She smirks, then oddly talks to the bunny:
1) 3) text: BOXES piled in the corner - BOY’S CLOTHES hanging. It’s a CLOSET that’s been turned into a secret hiding spot - replete with a TOYS, BOOKS, DRAWINGS, as well as CANDID PHOTOS of the SANDINS - MARY, JAMES and ZOEY (NOTE: no PHOTOS of CHARLIE). We FIND: YOUNG CHARLIE SANDIN - sitting on a small CHAIR in this, his secret getaway. (NOTE: This is clearly the back of Charlie's closet - into which he disappeared earlier.) Charlie’s not only wearing those multiple LAYERS OF CLOTHES, but he’s also now donning a bizarre pair of SMALL, CIRCULAR DARK GLASSES/GOGGLES - as well as holding an I-POD NANO-LIKE DEVICE which he handles expertly. WE HOLD ON CHARLIE - in those dark GLASSES/GOGGLES, seemingly staring off at nothing until we SEE what he’s
6) 3) dialog: I’m not doing this anymore. It’s stupid. James just stares at her, not accepting that. ZOEY (CONT’D) Fine. Calc test. Piano. Normal day. Who cares? It’s dumb.
8) 0) text: A ROOM with a BANK OF 12 HI-TECH COMPUTER SCREENS - SET UP LIKE SECURITY MONITORS ON A WALL. They are not on. MARY, ZOEY AND CHARLIE are ALL INSIDE THIS ROOM now. Charlie is holding Victor. Zoey is intently looking at her cell phone. Mary is scrutinizing Zoey:
10) 18) dialog: I’m gonna go be miserable in my room. See you in the morning. Zoey exits. Mary and James ignore her comment -— something else is clearly on their minds:
11) 0) text: As Zoey enters her room, SLAMMING the DOOR SHUT! So frustrated with her Dad. She sits on the bed, stewing, when she SEES: HER CLOSET DOOR OPENING. At first she’s startled, but fear quickly turns to relief and excitement when brooding boyfriend HENRY emerges from within. Zoey’s on her feet:
11) 1) dialog: - What are you doing here, baby? You shouldn't be out during the Purge - you could get hurt.
11) 3) dialog: OF COURSE! Thank God you’re here! She squeezes him - so happy. Henry squeezes her back.
13) 0) text: Henry sits on the bed now as cute Zoey paces in front of him. She rants emotionally about her father:
13) 1) dialog: - He knows how angry I am with him, but he keeps badgering me. It never stops.
13) 3) dialog: (cont'd) No matter how good I do - it’s never enough. Henry stands - embraces Zoey, caressing her hair:
13) 8) dialog: I’ll take two.
14) 9) dialog: - Something’s wrong, baby. I can’t keep my eyes open. It must be the pills. It must be - - BAM! Another GUNSHOT from the BASEMENT - a bit muted in this part of the house. As she fades into sleep:
14) 10) dialog: - What was that?
28) 0) text: As Mary exits the play room - pulling the door shut. She pauses - overwhelmed. The house is quiet around her, until BAM! BAM! LOUD RUNNING FOOTFALLS on the SECOND FLOOR. SOMEONE (Zoey, Henry, The Stranger) MOVING FAST. The SOUND nearly makes Mary jump out of her skin. Mary takes out the GUN. It’s awkward in her hand. She moves up the STAIRS - timidly. The tranquil domesticity of her bright home broken by STREAKS of BLOOD lining the floor, presumably Henry’s blood, or blood from the Stranger. She continues down the hall to:
28) 6) dialog: HE'S DEAD, MOM! HENRY’S DEAD!
28) 9) dialog: I have his blood all over me! Zoey’s intense sorrow brings immediate tears to Mary.
28) 11) dialog: Daddy killed him.
28) 15) dialog: Henry was just trying to make me happy! Because he loved me! If Daddy didn’t make me so miserable, Henry wouldn’t have done this and he'd still be alive!
28) 17) dialog: No! Stay away from me! 1/11 kill myself if anyone comes near me! I have nothing to live for anymore - Daddy took it all away! Her weeping reaches a crescendo - the young girl’s having an emotional breakdown.
28) 19) dialog: - He doesn’t love me! I’m just a thing - like this big house! Something to brag about.
28) 21) dialog: - He was right. Henry was right.
28) 23) dialog: (explosion)
41) 0) text: Charlie sits center room, with his glasses on, still looking at the world through Victor the Rabbit’s eyes. CHARLIE’S POV - OF MINI-SCREENS - THROUGH VICTOR’S EYES: Of his own ROOM. The Rabbit is still standing guard. All is quiet until WHAM! A FACE SUDDENLY POPS UP IN CHARLIE’S MINI-SCREENS - SO CLOSE AND DRENCHED IN BLOOD! CHARLIE JUMPS! SOMEONE IS AN INCH AWAY FROM VICTOR and STARING RIGHT IN THE RABBIT’S EYES - RIGHT AT CHARLIE! Terrified, Charlie gets his bearings, seeing that it’s: ZOEY - staring at Victor - her gaze distant, foggy, destroyed, lost. She’s holding Henry’s GUN and babbling:
41) 1) dialog: Hey, baby brother. You’re too young for all this. You shouldn't be looking around. (CONTINUED)
41) 4) dialog: I’m so scared. Daddy ruined everything and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to be alone. Where are you, Charlie? Zoey'’s voice fades. She’s moved away. Charlie’s shaking his head - confused - all he HEARS is MOVEMENT - is it Zoey looking for him? Suddenly, AHHHHH! Charlie HEARS a CURTAILED SCREAM - followed by SOUNDS of struggle. Charlie rips off his glasses, teary-eyed with fear.
42) 3) dialog: Bloody Stranger’s HOLDING ZOEY TIGHT, PRESSING A GUN (Henry’s gun) AGAINST HER SKULL. The Stranger has wrapped a CLOTH around Zoey’s MOUTH - HER CRIES stifled under this GAG. To James: (CONTINUED)
46) 0) text: James and the Stranger still negotiating - Zoey’s MOANS rising under that makeshift muzzle.
47) 0) text: LIT by a few CANDLES. ZOEY’S on a couch, still unconscious. CHARLIE’S next to ZOEY - the young boy looks horrified as he stares at: JAMES and MARY - who have dragged the BLOODY SCALPED SHOT STRANGER into this room and are now in the midst of trying to secure him to a DESK CHAIR so they can deliver him (roll him out) to the Freaks. But the Stranger (gagged, limbs bound with duct tape) is not making it easy - he’s fighting like a rabid dog as the Sandins cruelly and clumsily attempt to roll him INTO the CHAIR which is lying on its side (to accommodate the Stranger’s forced entry into it). It's pure chaos - the wealthy suburban Sandins are bruised, sweating, screaming, as they struggle furiously with the Stranger - his blood flying all over them.
49) 2) dialog: Daddy. James spins - and quickly crosses the room to ZOEY - who’s eyes are fluttering open. Zoey’s pretending to awaken slowly, looking around, acting confused. James sits next to her - cradling her head. (CONTINUED)
51) 92) dialog: But Zoey isn’t listening - she unleashes a barrage of GUNFIRE - UNLOADING HER ENTIRE CLIP. Mary, Charlie and James are cringing as the bullets blaze, until they realize they’re NOT being hit - ZOEY ISN'T SHOOTING AT JAMES - she’s shooting at: A FREAK - THE DIAPER-CLAD WEREWOLF - standing at the splintered FRONT DOOR. He was targeting the SANDINS but Zoey has just popped three bullets into his chest and she’s still unloading more rounds into him. He finally drops his gun, falls to the ground, dead. Zoey saved her family. They stare at her in shock. Zoey just stands there, blood-soaked, holding that smoking gun. She looks nearly insane - as if the events of the night have finally caught up with her. No one moves. Everyone wondering what Zoey will do next. Father and Daughter locked on each other, when Zoey begins crying - the sight of her dying father tearing her apart. Zoey drops her gun and runs to James, embracing him.
51) 93) dialog: I’m so sorry, Daddy. I love you. And she’s weeping now - it’s all coming out. James slowly reaches up - stroking her cheek:
51) 101) dialog: As brother and sister run down the STAIRS hand in hand. They reach bottom - into the BASEMENT HALL. They wait outside the TWO ROOMS that debouch off the hallway.
51) 102) dialog: We'll wait here for Mommy. They continue to hold hands in the dark. BACK TO: 84. MARY — FRONT HALL Now leaning over the BODY of a DEAD FREAK - by the splintered front door. She’s taking the FREAK’S GUN and stealing the bullets from his pocket. BACK TO:
51) 103) dialog: Still standing in the hall, still holding hands.
51) 110) text: Get the Parents. Zoey and Charlie watch TWO SMILEY FACE MASKED PEOPLE GOING UP THE STAIRS - toward the main part of the house.
53) 0) text: A FLURRY of FURIOUS MOVEMENT as about 6 SMILEY FACE MASKED PEOPLE tie up ZOEY and CHARLIE on the FLOOR. The Children are flopping around desperately, trying to break free from their quiet Happy Faced captors.

53) 26) dialog: Mrs. Ferrin, you don’t have to hurt us.
53) 40) dialog: They were going to kill us, Mom.
54) 0) text: All the NEIGHBORS, all alive, all now SEATED around the SANDIN DINING ROOM TABLE, including a whimpering Mrs. Ferrin whose bullet wounds are bandaged. MARY, covered in blood, sits at the HEAD of the table. CHARLIE and ZOEY are next to her. Also veiled in blood. Charlie is still wearing the layers of clothes - he is also donning his odd GLASSES and playing with the REMOTE. The BLOODY STRANGER stands behind everyone (his wounds also bandaged) - he’s covering the Neighbors with his gun. He’s cleaned up and standing tall - he looks like an absolute bad ass - the soldier he used to be. The NEIGHBORS all have their heads down, EATING a big, nearly gourmet BREAKFAST of OMELETTES, PANCAKES, FRENCH TOAST, POTATOES, BACON, CEREAL, FRUIT, etc. (CONTINUED)
55) 0) text: As the FRONT DOOR OPENS and THE STRANGER steps out - quickly followed by MARY, ZOEY, and CHARLIE (holding Victor). They’re all squinting from the intense, nearly blinding morning sunlight. They immediately see: DEAD FREAKS peppering their lawn; HOMELESS PEOPLE hanging from light poles; THE NEIGHBORHOOD MUTT carrying the DECAPITATED HUMAN HEAD in its teeth. The opulent cul-de-sac looks very different this morning. The Stranger considers the carnage then starts walking. Mary looks at her Children - they all seem a bit perplexed by what they’re doing - but they all start forward, following this Stranger, joining him as he walks down the middle of the street, away from the cul-de-sac. As they walk, Mary looks up at: SKY-BOARDS peppering the sky - MOST PURGE PARTICIPANTS -
