2) 16) dialog: (playful) Just being the perfect neighbor is all. I have a new hobby. Baking. But I made way too many cookies - so I hope you’re hungry. And before Mary could even say ‘thank you’:
2) 18) dialog: I know - more cookies is not what the Halversons needed. Mrs. Ferrin laughs - Mary politely joins in. Their laughter finally fades and silence follows. Mrs. Ferrin gestures toward the luxurious Sandin home:

Surprised, she puts down the plate. Mary steps onto a treadmill. She starts to run, when her eyes fall on a nearby WALL CALENDAR - on today’s date: TUESDAY, MARCH 21. THE ANNUAL PURGE. An unsettled look rises on her face. Mary runs faster. FADE TO BLACK.

53) 24) dialog: It took us a year. Underneath the yard and into the basement here. Charlie looks at Zoey - his mind blown:
53) 27) dialog: We do, young lady. It’s unpleasant - but necessary. Charlie goes to say something again - but he’s GAGGED. As is ZOEY. They’re turned over and HANDCUFFED. They can’t fight anymore, face down, bound. Their crying eyes held on each other when THE SOUND OF A DOOR OPENING O.S. gets their attention. They’re able to turn their heads, seeing: TWO MORE SMILEY FACE MASKED PEOPLE STANDING AT THE DOOR. SEEMINGLY THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WENT AFTER MARY. Everyone is looking at them as they enter.

Charlie is still wearing the layers of clothes - he is also donning his odd GLASSES and playing with the REMOTE. The BLOODY STRANGER stands behind everyone (his wounds also bandaged) - he’s covering the Neighbors with his gun. He’s cleaned up and standing tall - he looks like an absolute bad ass - the soldier he used to be. The NEIGHBORS all have their heads down, EATING a big, nearly gourmet BREAKFAST of OMELETTES, PANCAKES, FRENCH TOAST, POTATOES, BACON, CEREAL, FRUIT, etc. (CONTINUED)
