She hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed...The sound pouring in a glass...The sound of a glass being laid heav a table. Crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great ca slowly and silently unsheathes her Hanzo sword. Through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distort image of Budd's feet on the floor. She slowly rises...removes her black stocking cap...blond hair falls around her shoulders...sword in right hand...l hand grabs the front doorknob... QUICK as a Texas lizard on glass -- She brings the sword' handle down hard on the door lock -- EX CU Cheap Lock Busting. She flings the front door open...
