17) 59) dialog: Oh you too. Take care.
17) 65) dialog: That was uh...Veronica.

18) 26) dialog: I told you pal, I know what I'm know I'm doing. She just needed time.
19) 5) dialog: Oh baby youuuuu....
19) 9) dialog: Well, how hard can it be? It's a dresser, right?
20) 3) dialog: Fuck me!!! Do you think they intentionally pick a random piece of furniture to make totally unbuildable, just to fuck with you                        
20) 7) dialog: Wait. I got it.
21) 5) dialog: Fucking lay-up.

22) 14) dialog: Don't be sorry. It was nice. And I love you.
22) 18) dialog: Only to...god, I'm so stupid.
22) 23) dialog: You thought what? 32.
22) 29) dialog: You know, there's a guy that you can call, from Ikea, that will build you're dresser. You should call him. Hell, he'll probably fuck you too. I'm a fucking idiot.
30) 3) dialog: (on the phone) Hey. You're back. I want to talk to you.
32) 2) dialog: Really? Like subtitles or dubbed? Wait, actually, I'm really close to your house right now. Can I come by for a minute? It's....important.
33) 3) dialog: Okay. I have to tell you something.
33) 7) dialog: No, not gay.
33) 15) dialog: I'm having a baby.
33) 19) dialog: I'm having a baby.
33) 24) dialog: I am having a baby.
33) 29) dialog: Yes. With another person.
33) 34) dialog: With Veronica.
33) 38) dialog: You actually met her. That day at the book store. 38.
33) 43) dialog: Well, the truth is, I slept with Veronica three months ago. It was just a one night thing. But she's pregnant.
33) 48) dialog: No, you don't have to do anything.
33) 52) dialog: Yeah I know her. I mean, I'm getting to know her. And I really want to make it work with her.
33) 56) dialog: I've actually been seeing her, well, a lot, recently. And I think I really like her.
33) 60) dialog: The universe is fucking weird, Celeste. I slept with her months ago and never called her after.
33) 64) dialog: But we started hanging recently and she told me she was pregnant with my child. I know it's crazy, but it just feels...right. It was like this really weird retroactive gift. I don't know...
34) 5) dialog: Right. Look, I know this is so sudden. And so weird. I've been holding on to us, this idea of us, for so long. And I know you've wanted me to let go. So I'm sorry. You were right, we're friends. We will always be friends. And I need that now.
34) 9) dialog: Thank you. Love you.
37) 20) dialog: I just wanted to say hi. I'm Jesse. 43.
37) 31) dialog: Nice to meet you, Max.
37) 35) dialog: Cool. The puttanesca special is the thing to get.
37) 42) dialog: Oh, just here alone. Watching the Lakers.
37) 46) dialog: Yes. Epic.
37) 50) dialog: Nice to meet you, man. Good to see you, C.
50) 8) dialog: Hi. What's up?
50) 22) dialog: I'll get the veganchilada with the cashew cheese sauce on the side. Oh can I look at the seaweed menu?
50) 30) dialog: How are you? You look great.
50) 37) dialog: Oh yeah, they're vegan.
50) 42) dialog: A lot of pilates.
50) 46) dialog: Yeah, well, Veronica's a dancer and has equipment at our house, so...
50) 53) dialog: Good.
50) 58) dialog: Great.
50) 65) dialog: Celeste, I never wanted to hurt you.
50) 69) dialog: Look, I actually wanted to see you because...apparently there's some kind of hold up on your side with the divorce papers and Veronica's actually not a citizen so..
50) 73) dialog: Uh, Belgium.
50) 77) dialog: What?
50) 81) dialog: Point is, we need to...get married. I'm sorry. I really need you to sign those papers.
50) 86) dialog: I'm sorry. I know.
50) 90) dialog: I guess I'll have to figure it out. Veronica is really supportive of my work.
50) 94) dialog: That's true. And thank you.
50) 99) dialog: You had reservations about having kids.
50) 103) dialog: Well, ditto. I think Veronica will be a really good mother.
58) 6) dialog: What? Why did you say that?
58) 11) dialog: No one's ever said that to me.
60) 3) dialog: This is...so weird but I just realized...what's your middle name? I don't even know it.
60) 8) dialog: Goldleaf?
60) 12) dialog: Sweet. Mine's Mordechai.
60) 16) dialog: Means I'm really Jewish.
61) 13) dialog: Celeste?
61) 18) dialog: What...are you doing?
61) 25) dialog: But why were you in the trash can?
61) 30) dialog: In the trash can?
61) 35) dialog: You've met Veronica, right?
61) 56) dialog: Is that mine? 69.
67) 6) dialog: What the fuck is a Baby Bjorn?
67) 12) dialog: Why do you know that.
67) 20) dialog: Birthing towels, breast pump, Diaper genie? Fuck, I'm definitely having a baby. (beat) How's Celeste?
67) 24) dialog: Celeste doesn't smoke pot.
67) 31) dialog: Yeah, less sweet pregnant but it's probably just hormones.
67) 35) dialog: Yeah, I really like her. She seems great. For someone that I don't really know that's having my baby.
67) 44) dialog: A little. Yes.
72) 3) dialog: I started smoking again.
72) 8) dialog: I don't know what the rules are and I'm sure I'm breaking them but...god, I really miss you.
73) 4) dialog: Veronica is friends with the assistant gallerist there and he just really loved my stuff. I don't know, we'll see...
73) 8) dialog: Yeah, yeah. It's great.
73) 18) dialog: Can we just...lay here for a bit?
77) 3) dialog: Hey.
77) 7) dialog: We gotta talk.
77) 11) dialog: Celeste...
77) 19) dialog: I'm sorry. I can't.
78) 8) dialog: I don't know.
78) 12) dialog: I made a mistake.
78) 16) dialog: I shouldn't have come.
78) 20) dialog: I'm just trying to do the right thing with Veronica. I'm trying to change.
78) 25) dialog: To be honest, you didn't really let me. 83.
78) 30) dialog: Yeah, and I was never your equal. And you know what? I think you preferred it that way.
78) 34) dialog: And how do you define success, Celeste? Because you don't look very successful right now.
78) 38) dialog: What do you want?
78) 42) dialog: Wrong? Wrong about what? What did you want me to do? Wait for you to meet someone first? Is that how you saw it happening?
78) 50) dialog: I feel really sorry for you. You might be alone forever. 84.
78) 56) dialog: Don't worry about it.
90) 3) dialog: I know this may not the best time to talk about this...but...at some point, we will have to talk about Tucker's dance moves.
90) 8) dialog: Wow. Wow. 95.
90) 12) dialog: Your speech was really...beautiful. Thank you.
90) 16) dialog: I know.
90) 25) dialog: Aw yeah! Fuck!
90) 30) dialog: Hey.
90) 35) dialog: What? Nothing. We're just...
97) 86) dialog: Oh, thank you.
97) 93) dialog: No, I actually found it digging through your trash.
97) 105) dialog: So...we're divorced!
97) 110) dialog: You wanna walk for a couple minutes?
98) 5) dialog: I thought you hated them.
98) 13) dialog: I'm just feeling like maybe you were right. I am a fuck up. I don't know what I'm doing. My girlfriend left.
98) 18) dialog: Left me. She wanted me to tell her everything was gonna be okay and I couldn't. I don't know why but I just...couldn't. She wants to go back to Brussels.
98) 25) dialog: Do what?
98) 29) dialog: You do?
98) 33) dialog: For what?
98) 37) dialog: Oh, you're welcome.
98) 42) dialog: But I don't know if everything is gonna be all right.
98) 47) dialog: I do.
98) 51) dialog: Okay. Okay.
98) 60) dialog: Me too.
98) 64) dialog: Huh?
