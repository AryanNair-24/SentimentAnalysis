0) 9) dialog: Jess, turn it down, seriously!
0) 17) dialog: (on the phone) Okay. Ready? This year all trends point towards simplicity and comfort.
0) 32) dialog: (she whispers to Jesse) Shhh. Phone call.(back to her call) That's enough of a blurb, right?
0) 38) dialog: Okay. Call me back if they need more.
0) 44) dialog: Okay, thanks bye. (to Jesse) Can't you just sit still for two minutes? And we talked about this, no more smoking!
0) 49) dialog: Come on.
0) 57) dialog: What are you doing? Why are you stopping?
0) 62) dialog: Oh wow...you are so thoughtful.
1) 4) dialog: Jess, that place is insane. They have tassels that were manufactured for Mussolini's mistress...
1) 8) dialog: Okay then.
1) 14) dialog: (whispers) Did you get the job??
1) 22) dialog: Was that the job? Did you get the book job?
1) 29) dialog: What the fuck are you talking about? 6.
1) 34) dialog: Is this about surfing? You're talking about going surfing. Unbelievable.
1) 38) dialog: Oh, god.
1) 42) dialog: I'm not...
1) 46) dialog: No, yeah, I just thought it was about the Slate job you interviewed for.
1) 50) dialog: I absolutely do, yes. You are a wonderful artist. But at some point, you will show the world that one day...right?
1) 54) dialog: Well...
1) 59) dialog: Yeah. Take me home, it's fine.
2) 3) dialog: Be back by six so you can shower.
2) 7) dialog: Dinner with Beth and Tucker.
2) 11) dialog: Have fun shredding your glassy peel.
2) 15) dialog: Love you.
3) 11) dialog: They opened for Darcy Fudged His Knickers. Now, they're amazing. You'd be lucky to book them for your wedding. Or you should see if Emergency Breakthrough is available. The horn section is tight.
3) 21) dialog: So veee ahhh gawwnna share zeh beet zalad and zeh bolognese, riiiiiiight?
3) 25) dialog: I don't vant dessert. I vill joost have bite oof yorrrs.
3) 29) dialog: Yawh!!!! 9.
3) 36) dialog: Are you okay? Oh no...
3) 40) dialog: Honey, weddings are stressful, I know all about it. But you guys we'll be fine!
3) 45) dialog: What do you mean?
3) 58) dialog: No charades. We are separated and we're friends. You guys should be happy, all we did was fight before.
3) 62) dialog: Yeah, everyone's cool.
3) 69) dialog: Yah, she iz uber angry. Yahhh.
4) 6) dialog: Ahhhhh! Oh god!
4) 14) dialog: It's not weird that we hang out. Do you think it's weird we hang out?
4) 18) dialog: Yeah you too. I mean, we can't not hang out. The last time we didn't talk for longer than a week was in 10th grade when you went to Space Camp Canada.
5) 3) dialog: Well, I'm exhausted.
5) 8) dialog: Hey, it's kinda chilly tonight, how's the heat in there?
5) 16) dialog: Jesse, please, you can stay here as long as you like. It's your studio. It's actually really nice to have you here.
5) 20) dialog: Oh, don't forget, the contractor needs to get in there for measurements in the morning. So make sure your thingys, your sculptures, whatever...are out of the way.
5) 24) dialog: Night.
5) 28) dialog: Love you too.
7) 7) dialog: Excuse me, sir?
7) 17) dialog: Did you not?
7) 21) dialog: So you did know. And everyone's in a rush, so...
7) 26) dialog: Well, it's not just her. It's everyone behind her too. So, if you want to ask all these people if it's okay to cut in front of them because you are late, be my guest. Just don't assume that your time is more important than everyone else's.
7) 32) dialog: (sotto) Prick.
8) 4) dialog: American culture is dying. We have an unrelenting appetite for processed junk food, talentless pop stars like Riley Banks and recycled movie franchises like Transformers. The more we consume crap, the more we want crap.
9) 5) dialog: I think there will be a groundswell movement towards simplicity. People will start to listen to their most rudimentary needs-- they will crave mental, spiritual and physical nourishment. It's back to basics.
9) 10) dialog: Thanks so much, Rachel.
10) 3) dialog: So I had dinner with the drama club last night.
10) 7) dialog: Tucker and Beth. They're such dicks. They left in protest because they think Jesse and I are being "unhealthy." So judgy, right? We're fine.
10) 11) dialog: Spare me the spiritual platitudes, Scotty. If we were gay,(she motions to Scott) no one would even question us being friends!
10) 15) dialog: Yeah there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, what do you think?
10) 20) dialog: Wait, we're signing Riley Banks?? When were you going to tell me?? I just trashed her on Rachel Maddow. Great. 16.
10) 25) dialog: Scott, you and I built this company so we wouldn't have to take an account like Riley Banks.
10) 29) dialog: She's like a...soul-less hologram.
10) 33) dialog: Ok. Fine. I'm gonna go eat lunch.
10) 38) dialog: I don't do dating. The right guy will show up. And I'm still on track for my 25 year plan.
10) 42) dialog: First child at 33. Second at 35. Which means I will only be 56 at my eldest's college graduation. The bad news is that I may not be at my 4th grandchild's high school graduation. But that's okay, I guess.
10) 47) dialog: I've got time. I'm not worried.
10) 52) dialog: What are you doing?
10) 56) dialog: Yeah don't.
12) 5) dialog: But kind of beautiful. In a grotesque way. 20.
12) 14) dialog: Beth, the reality is I love Jesse dearly but he doesn't have a checking account. Or dress shoes. The father of my children will have a car. But...Jesse will always be my best friend.
12) 18) dialog: Jesse is fine.
12) 22) dialog: Sure.
12) 28) dialog: What am I looking at? 21.
12) 33) dialog: Ewww. Will you get that thing lasered off, please? What the fuck?
12) 37) dialog: Are you serious? That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. It's not a turnip.
12) 41) dialog: Okay, well at least pluck it for Chrissake.
12) 45) dialog: What is wrong with you?
12) 51) dialog: Sorry sir, my friend has a really strong emotional reaction to modern art.
12) 55) dialog: Had to be done. 22.
13) 3) dialog: Hey...you're not working? Are you watching the Olympics? Again? And crying? Again?
13) 8) dialog: God, you really love that, don't you?
13) 12) dialog: Well, three years ago now but...
13) 17) dialog: Uh huh. Hey, did you finish that artwork for the Pop Form website?
13) 21) dialog: I'll like it more when I have it because I needed it yesterday, so... 23.
13) 27) dialog: Oh. Okay. Does it have something to do with the work you owe me?
13) 32) dialog: A date? Really? That is so great.
13) 36) dialog: Yeah! Don't cry. Good for you, Jess.
13) 40) dialog: Really? Yogurt Girl, huh. She's cute! But so young, right?
13) 44) dialog: Okay, no need for that. But this is good! You gotta crawl before you walk. I mean she's definitely not gonna be wifey number two, right? Ha.
13) 50) dialog: Big move. I'm proud of you.
13) 55) dialog: Can I get up now?
13) 62) dialog: No, nothing. Are you gonna wear your hair like that?
13) 66) dialog: Not weird, just different from how it looks best.
13) 72) dialog: There. Better. You'll be great. You don't even need to be great. Just be you. Take her somewhere nice.
13) 76) dialog: Call me after? 25.
17) 3) dialog: Where is it? They told me it would be in new releases... 26.
17) 13) dialog: There.
17) 17) dialog: Yes I can.
17) 23) dialog: Some people are browsing my book. Guys, come with me to eavesdrop ...
17) 55) dialog: Wow, thank you. That is so nice.
17) 63) dialog: What is that?
17) 67) dialog: Story?
17) 71) dialog: Huh. She's pretty.
19) 3) dialog: I'm in here! Fuck Sweden!
19) 7) dialog: It was definitely easier to build the Brooklyn Bridge, I think.
20) 5) dialog: Thank you!
21) 3) dialog: Perfect.
21) 8) dialog: Ruscha meets Basquiat...
21) 12) dialog: Yeah. He's a vegan, you know.
21) 18) dialog: You're cute.
22) 3) dialog: Hey. What are you doing?
22) 8) dialog: Okay...
22) 12) dialog: Yeah. Whoa, we were drunk. What a bad idea. I'm sorry.
22) 16) dialog: Oh Jess, I don't...come on, we were drunk, and the dresser and I thought...you're dating other people!
22) 21) dialog: Oh no, I thought...
22) 26) dialog: Well, clearly I wasn't thinking. Or I wouldn't have let it happen. Come on Jess, we're not getting back together, you didn't think...
22) 31) dialog: Jess! No, I didn't..Jess!
23) 5) dialog: What?
23) 9) dialog: Oh. Hi.
23) 14) dialog: My practice?? It was...wait, what?...it was fine. (who is this guy?) 33.
23) 20) dialog: Are you really doing this right now? You're really doing this right now.
23) 25) dialog: Just gonna jump right in there. Wow, Captain Conversation.
23) 29) dialog: You bring cards to yoga??
23) 34) dialog: (she looks at the card.) A financial analyst. Cool.
23) 38) dialog: No, no I didn't.
23) 44) dialog: I'm a trend forecaster. I forecast trends.
23) 50) dialog: You traded in your Porsche for an Audi because the economy is tanking and you're afraid you'll lose your job soon. You bought a Samsung cell phone because you think it makes you seem more "business-oriented," unlike the iPhone which is for teenage girls. You go to yoga because you went to a sub Ivy League college, spent the last ten years working long weeks and drinking all weekend and you feel like it's time to do something "spiritual." Nice to meet you, (looks at the card) Paul.
25) 3) dialog: No, just make sure the San Fran focus group has a little more diversity than last time. It was like a rave. Without drugs. Okay.
29) 2) dialog: Hey. It's me. Again. I miss you. Anyway, call me. Okay. Bye.
31) 3) dialog: Yeah, I want to talk to you too. Where have you been?? It's been like two weeks. So much to lay down...like, did you know that pay- per-view porn is available in Cantonese?
33) 5) dialog: Me too. Wait, you first. Are you gay?
33) 13) dialog: (playfully) Oh no, did you go on another date?
33) 17) dialog: I don't understand.
33) 22) dialog: What do you mean?
33) 27) dialog: With another person?
33) 32) dialog: Um. What? Sorry, I'm confused. Wait, what? What the fuck? With whom?
33) 36) dialog: Veronica?? What's a Veronica?
33) 41) dialog: Huh. But that's not even physically possible, that was two weeks ago.
33) 46) dialog: Whoa. Okay. Shit. Didn't know about that. But that's not important right now. This is not good. Alright. Okay. You and I are gonna deal with this. We will, we'll just have to. What do you need me to do?
33) 50) dialog: But you don't even know this person, right?
33) 54) dialog: Make it work?? You slept with her once! What are you talking about?
33) 58) dialog: So what you're saying is you got a girl pregnant and now you think you like her because she's pregnant? Or...I'm really confused.
33) 66) dialog: Can you excuse me for a second?
34) 3) dialog: Sorry about that. I had something in my eye.
34) 7) dialog: Of course.
34) 16) dialog: It was nothing.
35) 5) dialog: Hey.
35) 10) dialog: I'm just following Diddy Twitty.
35) 14) dialog: It's Sean Comb's Twitter page. There's also a singing competition on television. It's called American Idol? Keep up.
35) 18) dialog: Well, just part of our job, so...ready for breaking news? Jesse is having a baby with some girl. Crazy.
35) 22) dialog: It's this girl he slept with once a couple of months ago.
35) 26) dialog: And now he's "making it work" with her. Plane crash.
35) 30) dialog: No need, Scott, I'm totally fine.
35) 34) dialog: Look, I wasn't going to have his baby. So, good for him.
35) 39) dialog: Right. Well, let me see...mmmm, nope, I'm fine. I promise. Not in love with him anymore. It kind of makes it easier.
35) 46) dialog: The yahoo who did Pop Form's taxes last quarter. He's been asking me out forever. Not the one, but it'll be nice to be admired.
37) 3) dialog: Thank you.
37) 11) dialog: OH MY GOD. My ex is here. Oh god, oh no, we just made eye contact. Maybe he didn't see me. Wait, he did. He's coming over. Oh god, this is so awkward.(to Max) You should probably leave.
37) 15) dialog: Yeah, just go.
37) 23) dialog: Oh, this is Matt.
37) 27) dialog: Mack.
37) 33) dialog: We're just here. Just eating. It's a date. I'm dating.
37) 40) dialog: Who are you here with?
37) 52) dialog: You too. You too.
37) 57) dialog: Uh huh.
37) 62) dialog: I'm fine!
37) 70) dialog: Nothing. Do you like bread?
37) 74) dialog: Cool, cool.
38) 3) dialog: This was great! I'm free next Wednesday? Sushi?
38) 7) dialog: Oh, because of mercury poisoning? I think that's a myth. I go to this acupuncturist that... 45.
38) 12) dialog: Thank you for your concern but I'm just fine. I guess you're just not a match for me.
38) 17) dialog: (sotto) Whatever.
39) 7) dialog: Hi honey!
39) 11) dialog: Yeah I ran. Just started. It's really fun.
39) 15) dialog: 13.5 actually. I was just clearing my head, you know, keeping the endorphins up. 46.
39) 21) dialog: Oh, okay! Wow, is this it? It's so nice.
39) 27) dialog: Right. Sorry. Totally.
39) 31) dialog: You should get it. It's really pretty.
39) 36) dialog: Don't worry. I know people who can get that out. Easily.
40) 3) dialog: The Riley account is a handful. I've been sooooo swamped. 47.
40) 8) dialog: (about the couch) If it doesn't come out, I can have it reupholstered.
40) 16) dialog: Great. Dating's really great.
40) 20) dialog: No, but I actually ran into him last night. I think he's getting a little fat.
40) 24) dialog: So you've seen Jesse?
40) 28) dialog: Huh. Have you hung out with...
40) 32) dialog: Yeah.
40) 42) dialog: She's dumb, right?
40) 46) dialog: Simple means dumb.
40) 50) dialog: Elegant??
40) 55) dialog: Elegant??
40) 62) dialog: I am, I just didn't realize that Monica was "elegant."
40) 70) dialog: Not one.
40) 74) dialog: Sure. I have a date tonight so I should probably shower before then.
40) 79) dialog: Rupert Bates.
40) 83) dialog: 22. Skillz set me up. He's about to be a huge star. He's filming "20,000 B.C.?" It's the prequel to
41) 8) dialog: That was so...good.
41) 12) dialog: Lucky lady. So how do you know Skillz?
41) 16) dialog: (sotto) Ew.
41) 21) dialog: Oh...hi. Oh god. (whispers) Oh no, no, no I gotta go.
43) 12) dialog: Hi Riley, I'm Celeste, I'm a partner at Pop Form.
43) 23) dialog: Um...it's actually regimen?
43) 27) dialog: Regime is a system of government. It's a "skin regimen."
43) 33) dialog: Charming.
44) 8) dialog: Right. Yes. Sorry. So we are going for an industrial feel with the artwork...
45) 5) dialog: Uh, you got my IM.
45) 9) dialog: Where are the guys who don't wear makeup for a living? And maybe a little intellect? A little intellect wouldn't hurt anybody.
45) 14) dialog: The photographer? You know him? 53.
45) 19) dialog: (she sings, like she's in a musical) I'm uncomfortable with daaaaaating. I don't like any of iiiiiit.
45) 23) dialog: You really got to try a little harder to integrate the gayness, Scott.
46) 3) dialog: So you pissed in your pants?
46) 8) dialog: Wow. That is incredible. I think he's smiling, maybe.
46) 12) dialog: Well, the world will think you're brilliant. No one will ever know but me. 54.
46) 17) dialog: Well, the guy who won shit his pants, so...
46) 22) dialog: How about room service?
47) 3) dialog: That was really, really nice.
47) 7) dialog: Making out with you.
47) 18) dialog: (whisper) Why are you doing that? Don't do that..It was going so well.
47) 26) dialog: Almost where?? No!
49) 6) dialog: Vegan Vittles.
50) 3) dialog: No, I don't want to do a video chat. Yeah. Just tell her she needs to get to L.A. tomorrow. Okay. (she hangs up, now on the Blackberry) Sorry, one second, I just have to send this e-mail.
50) 10) dialog: A lot. (to waitress) Can I get some coffee?
50) 14) dialog: Um, green tea?
50) 18) dialog: Water's fine.
50) 28) dialog: Wow.
50) 32) dialog: Thanks.
50) 40) dialog: You look good too.
50) 44) dialog: Huh, I didn't know you did pilates.
50) 51) dialog: Um...work is great.
50) 55) dialog: My book is getting great reviews. Riley Banks is a new client which is huge. Things are going really well. 58.
50) 63) dialog: It's only weird if you think it's weird.
50) 67) dialog: Thank you. You didn't. Glad we cleared that up.
50) 71) dialog: What? Where's she from?
50) 75) dialog: (sotto) Huh. Belgium. Elegant.
50) 79) dialog: Nothing.
50) 83) dialog: Well, Jesse, I've been busy with work. Because some people work for a living. So I haven't really been focused on what I can do to help you get on with your new life. 59.
50) 88) dialog: What makes you think you are even suitable to be a dad?? You don't even know how to read the electric bill. How are you going to support yourself? Have you even thought this through?
50) 92) dialog: Really? Really Jesse? I paid the rent for ten years. If that's not supportive, I don't know what is.
50) 97) dialog: We never even talked about kids.
50) 101) dialog: I had reservations about having kids with YOU.
50) 105) dialog: Low blow.
50) 117) dialog: Exactly. Get a real job.
53) 3) dialog: Jesse's a fucking vegan??
53) 7) dialog: The Gagosian?? You're kidding. What, the fucking clothespin thing? When??
53) 11) dialog: Don't tell me actually...how did anybody even know about his art, he doesn't...I don't actually want to know...god, he's on fire right now. Breaking up with me was the best thing that ever happened to Jesse. I should break up with me.
53) 15) dialog: Shut up. Unless it's Jesse's. Who are dressed as again?
53) 19) dialog: Ooh, he just got a buzzcut.
53) 23) dialog: A couple hours ago. It was on Perez.
53) 27) dialog: I need to fucking drink.
53) 34) dialog: 
54) 5) dialog: What? Oh, White trash.
54) 15) dialog: Yoga?
54) 19) dialog: I've been running a lot. Keeps you in better shape.
54) 25) dialog: How's your practice? (waving her finger in his face, laughing)
54) 29) dialog: Uh huh. What are you? 63.
54) 34) dialog: You're "punny."
54) 38) dialog: About what?
54) 42) dialog: Barely an Ivy.
54) 46) dialog: Do you smoke?
54) 50) dialog: Me too. Let's go.
55) 5) dialog: Shhhh. Don't say open. Your costume's great. Don't ruin it.
55) 10) dialog: My husband of six years wants a divorce so he can marry the woman who's carrying his child. That's the deal with you and me.
55) 14) dialog: He's having a baby with a girl he barely knows. He's so lost. He's just going about it all...wrong.
55) 18) dialog: What do you mean?
55) 22) dialog: Listen, Yoga, I don't WANT to be right, I AM right. People will let you down. I've accepted that fact, but unfortunately, most of the time, knowing that does keep you from being happy. But at least it's real.
56) 3) dialog: Hey, it's Celeste. You know, I still have a bunch of your stuff in the office. You should probably grab it at some point. Okay.
59) 3) dialog: At least they recycle.
61) 4) dialog: Guitar Hero?? That's quite an extravagant purchase for a freelance writer and his "elegant" Belgian bride.
61) 16) dialog: Hey!
61) 20) dialog: I just...
61) 27) dialog: I lost something. 68.
61) 32) dialog: My bracelet. It was a whole thing. It's over now.
61) 37) dialog: Yes! Hi! Wow, you're so pregnant, right! I love your sweater.
61) 41) dialog: What? Oh (she touches her cheek), yeah, I guess I am.
61) 45) dialog: NO. No, don't. It's fine, just a little cut.
61) 49) dialog: No, I'm sorry. So sorry. Well, I'm late for things. Have a good afternight.
61) 53) dialog: Nooooo, no. That's very nice but no. Great to see you guys! Okay.
61) 59) dialog: Waht? Oh, yeah, that's weird. I don't know how...here you go.
63) 5) dialog: It was a disaster. But you should have seen the sweater. So great. Beth, am I losing my mind?
63) 9) dialog: This guys Paul keeps calling me but I don't know...
63) 14) dialog: I met him at the gym. I'm not meeting my husband at the gym.
64) 3) dialog: So where do you live?
64) 8) dialog: Cool.
64) 13) dialog: Ahhhhh.(responding to the stretch) Wow, this is a unique place to take a date.
64) 17) dialog: I feel special.
64) 25) dialog: Not...that well. I've been on a real winning streak, so I thought I'd call you.
64) 30) dialog: AHHHH! I don't know what your definition of relaxing is but...
65) 3) dialog: Why would you take me to a place where Asian people beat you up? That was absolute torture.
65) 8) dialog: I feel great, actually.
65) 12) dialog: Where are we going now?
65) 18) dialog: Oh my god, don't, with the yoga.
66) 3) dialog: This place is...really cool.
66) 7) dialog: I am, Westwood condo.
66) 15) dialog: Ohh!!
66) 20) dialog: Vairyaga, bro, let go. Not everything has to have a reason. 73.
69) 6) dialog: I don't know what I'm doing. Dating is stupid and all of a sudden, my ex-husband bakes cakes? It's probably fucking gluten-free.
69) 10) dialog: Nothing. Can you just roll a joint please?
69) 16) dialog: What are they like together?
69) 21) dialog: Yeah.
69) 25) dialog: So he's not happy.
70) 5) dialog: Oh, thank you. Yeah, I think it's perfect.
70) 9) dialog: Wow, yeah, there is a little of that happening. I.M. Pei. Huh.
70) 13) dialog: No, I'm just impressed that you know anything about architecture.
70) 17) dialog: I'm sorry?
70) 22) dialog: Are you...?? How dare you...
71) 3) dialog: Dark little prison?? Bitch, what does she know. You know what's a dark little prison?? Having to wear midriffs for a living. What does she...
72) 5) dialog: I can see that. That must go well with your pilates.
72) 11) dialog: You want to come in?
73) 6) dialog: Jesse, that's great. I'm so happy for you.
73) 13) dialog: Yeah. It's really nice to see you.
74) 3) dialog: Yeah. 79.
75) 3) dialog: I don't see anything.
