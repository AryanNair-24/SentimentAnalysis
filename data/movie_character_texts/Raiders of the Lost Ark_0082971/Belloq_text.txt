The edge of the sunlight moving across the miniature city still a good two feet beyond the spot Belloq has settled And now that line of light is broken by the shadow of an  ornate sun at the top of the staff. Indy's face reflects his concentration. And then his imme pleasure. He sees what he came for. Out of the miniature city, one small building is being li by a tiny beam of sunlight in the center of the shadow of the metal sun. And by some trick of ancient artistry, thi one building responds to the sunlight like none of the ot The golden light permeates it: it seems to glow.

A light so bright, a power so fearsome, a char so jolting, that there is nothing in our world to compare it. It's as though this magnificent golden box has been  gathering electric energy for three thousand years, waiti for just this crack of the lid to release it all in one f cleansing explosion of pure force. Blinding arcs of light shoot out across the Tabernacle  instantly killing all the Nazis inside and turning the wh silk to flame. But it is Belloq in his obsession who take the full blast. His whole body seems lit by a million vol current and, for a moment, his complete form is white, th blue, then maybe green, but it is hard to tell because ou eyes are blinded now too. Two aspects of this ghastly,  beautiful display are somehow communicated in the chaos,  although the communication is subliminal. First, that Bel in the instant of his destruction, has experienced some k of sublime, transcendental knowledge. If a death's-head c smile and look satisfied, that is how Belloq's incandesce face would be described. Secondly, this event is accompan by a sound like no other. A sound so intense and so odd a so haunting that the suggestible among us might imagine i were the whisper of God.
