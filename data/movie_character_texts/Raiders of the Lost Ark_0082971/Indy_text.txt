With the same fluid move that brings Ind body around to face the Peruvian, the whip uncoils to its full ten foot length and flashes out. The fall of the whip (the unplaited strip at the end of t lash) wraps itself around Barranca's hand and pistol. He  could not drop the gun now if he tried. Indy gives the whip a short pull and Barranca's arm in je down, where it involuntarily discharges the gun into the  dirt. Barranca is amazed, but feels some slack in the whi and immediately raises the gun toward Indy again, cocking with his free hand. Indy's face goes hard. And sad. Indy sweeps his arm in a wide arc. Barranca spins around, enclosed in the whip, his gun hand stuck tight against hi body. Indy gives one more short jerk on the whip handle a Barranca's gun fires. Barranca falls dead.

Fifteen feet of it cuts open beneath the lash, falling away to reveal black as wide as the hall. The illusory floor was made of dust- covered cobwebs. Satipo picks up a stone and drops it dow the pit. No sound. The two men exchange glances. Indy loo up at the high roof of the hall. He swings the whip up ar a support beam, tests its strength with a pull and swings over the pit on the whip. From the other side he swings t whip back to Satipo, who throws Indy the torch.

Its body is  riddled with little deadly darts. This has great signific to Indy and he stands with even greater caution. He waves the torch ahead of him and at waist height an air current whips at the flame. Indy ducks under it and leaves a burn mark on the white tile beneath it. Satipo watches, wide-eyed and mystified. Indy reaches the altar. The tiny idol looks both fierce a beautiful. It rests on a pedestal of polished stone. Indy looks the whole set-up over very carefully. From his jack he takes a small, canvas drawstring bad. He begins fillin it with dirt from around the case of the altar. When he h created a weight that he thinks approximates the weight o the idol, he bounces it a couple times in his palm  concentrating. It's clear he wants to replace the idol wi the bag as smoothly as possible. His hand seems ready to that once, when he stops, takes a breath and loosens his  shoulder muscles. Now he sets himself again. And makes th switch! The idol is now in his hand, the bag on the pedes For a long moment it sits there, then the polished stone  beneath the bag drops five inches. This sets off an AURAL CHAIN REACTION of steadily increasing volume as some huge mysterious mechanism rumbles into action deep in the temp Indy spins and starts his kata back across the sanctuary four times the speed.

What you had to do was  take the Staff to a special map room  in Tanis - it had the whole city  laid out in miniature on the floor.
