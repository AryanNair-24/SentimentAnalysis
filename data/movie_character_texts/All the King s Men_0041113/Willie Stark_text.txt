You over  there... look at your pants. Have  they got holes in the knees? Listen  to your stomach. Did you ever hear  it rumble from hunger?... And you,  what about your crops? Did they ever  rot in the field because the road  was so bad you couldn't get them to  market?... And you. What about your  kids? Are they growing up ignorant  as dirt, ignorant as you, 'cause  there's no school for them?... No,  I'm not going to read you any speech.

0) 303) dialog: Get ready to bust your sides laughing,  'cause it's sure a funny story. It's  about a hick... a hick like you, if  you please. Yeah, like you. He grew  up on the dirt roads and gully washes  of a farm. He knew what it was to  get up before dawn and get feed and  slop and milk before breakfast...  and then set out before sunup and  walk six miles to a one-room, slab- sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick  knew what it was to be a hick, all  right. He figured if he was going to  get anything done, he had to do it  himself. So he sat up nights and  studied books. He studied law because  he thought he might be able to change  things some... for himself, and for  folks like him.
0) 305) dialog: No, I'm not going to lie to you. He  didn't start off thinking about the  hicks and all the wonderful things  he was going to do for them. No. No,  he started off thinking of number  one. But something came to him on  the way. How he could do nothing for  himself without the help of the  people. That's what came to him. And  it also came to him, with the powerful  force of God's own lightning, back  in his home country, when a  schoolhouse collapsed because it was  built of politics... rotten brick.  It killed and mangled a dozen kids.  But you know that story. The people  were his friends because he fought  that rotten brick. And some of the  politicians down in the city, they  knew that... So they rode up to his  house in a big, fine, shiny car and  said as how they wanted him to run  for governor...

He was just a country boy who thought  that even the plainest, poorest man  can be governor if his fellow citizens  find he's got the stuff for the job.  Well, those fellows in the striped  pants... they saw the hick and they  took him in.
