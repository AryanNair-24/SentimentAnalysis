18) 37) dialog: (shaking with anger) All I get is that this is wrong -- BAM! Rippner's forehead suddenly SMACKS Lisa's in a vicio HEAD-BUTT that knocks her OUT COLD. This as Rippner throws quick ‘glances toward the seats th might be in his line of sight. But no one's looking. Most still sleeping. The Headphone Kid's doing homework. Rebecca's playing her gameboy. Rippner turns back, shaking, adrenaline overload -- He reaches over, pulis a pillow from Lisa's seat pocket, stuffs it between her head and the window. He quickly glances aft again -—-
19) 1) dialog: Still out. A sudden jolt of TURBULENCE causes her eyes to flutter ev so slightly. Another TREMOR. Lisa's eyes open, gradually bringing the dark, blurry cabin into focus. She's still disoriented, and we along with her, not entir sure how much time has passed -- Lisa slowly sits up, turns to see Rippner sitting in his seat, thoroughly engrossed in the DR. PHIL BOOK. Lisa fully awakens at the sight. Stunned. She looks back, gets a glimpse of the nice lady who's sleeping in her sea Or so we hope. TURBULENCE. Heavy. Continuous now. The kind that makes even the most seasoned traveler wonder. A few LIGHTNING FLASHES out the window. The seat belt signs BING to life.
19) 6) text: (doing his best Dr Phil) I want you to get excited about your life, but you've gotta get real. (then reading, still impersonating) ‘I'm challenging you, starting now, to stop dealing in opinions or assumptions, and start dealing in facts.' (then to Lisa) Fact ~- you've been out for a half hour and Keefe's room hasn't been changed. A beat. Then -- Rippner holds out his fist to Lisa. She eyes it as he turns it over, opens it to reveal -- TWO ASPIRIN. RIPPNER (cont'd) You'll thank me later. Lisa hesitates. RIPPNER (cont'd) It's aspirin, Leese. I need you coherent, remember?
19) 7) text: Another beat. Then Lisa holds out her hand. Rippner drops the aspirin into it. He pulls a fresh bottled water from her seat pocket, cracks it open, hands it to her. She dow the aspirin. Takes a few swigs amidst more TURBULENCE.
19) 8) dialog: (fighting her fear of erashing) If I do it, if I call, then you'll call the person outside dad's house? Tell him to go away? Rippner smiles, sure now he's got her.
19) 16) dialog: You've said enough. He hands her the phone. She puts it to her ear. We hear another RING. Then -- the slightly GARBLED VOICE of CYNTH

As if Lisa weren't terrified enough -- sh shakily slides the window shade down halfway -- LISA (cont'd) I'm sorry -~ (beat) It was just a rough couple of days... (then; quickly) Listen, something came up, we've gotta change Keefe's room. Can you pull up the file?
19) 44) dialog: What, you don't have a back-up plan? Rippner remains silent. LISA (cont'd) -- Why do this now, here --
19) 54) dialog: (re: airphone service) What if it never starts working?
22) 0) text: ON LISA AND RIPPNER -- sitting in silence. Looks like it' been this way awhile. The turbulence is subsiding. Rippner checks the airphone. Still dead. Lisa turns to the window. Rippner stuffs his pretzel bag his seat pocket. Eyes his watch. Somewhere on the plane, we hear a BABY start to CRY... Another long beat of this... then...
22) 1) dialog: I know him. (off Rippner) Keefe. He's a decent man.
22) 8) dialog: I have to go to the restroom. In answer, Rippner unscrews her empty water bottle, holds out to her:

23) 0) text: Lisa shakily slides the latch closed. Stands there, dazed for a split second beat -- then suddenly -- she collapses the floor, the terror finally overwhelming her. She forces her body to turn around. She throws open the toilet seat. Dry heaves. Convulses. Tears flowing. The onset of an emotional meltdown that's long overdue.
23) 1) dialog: Oh my God -- help me -- somebody help me... She tries to regulate her breathing. Grabs a bunch of toi paper and wipes her nose. Throws the paper in the bowl an flushes, watching as the blue liquid swirls around the bo Slams the lid shut. One more deep breath gives her the strength to pull herse to her feet. Her legs are still wobbly as she puts her ha on the sink, her arms supporting most of her weight. Spla water on her face, drinks a little. Then squirts some soft soap into her hand, about to rinse but something stops her. Lisa eyes the gel in her hand, a idea forming.
25) 0) text: Lisa steps back from the mirror -- we reveal the soft-soa written message -- 18 F HAS BOMB. She considers another beat. Satisfied. Lisa rinses, dries her hands with a paper towel. She unlo the door, opens it. About to step out when
25) 21) dialog: -- Please... just stop whoever's at my dad's house --
25) 30) dialog: Somewhere, we see these words find their mark -- Rippner seems to genuinely be considering her words as his eyes s away, down to her blouse. It's gaping open. He sees the scar on Lisa's neck. Considers it a beat, then --
