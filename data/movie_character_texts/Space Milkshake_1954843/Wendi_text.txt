52) 3) dialog: You are Station Engineering Specialist Jimmy Anderson. You are a Libra. Your favorite color is blue. Your favorite food is chocolate cake.
52) 5) dialog: All systems are nominal, however I have not received a mission protocol update from Western Alliance Ground Control. How are you feeling?
52) 7) dialog: Yes Jimmy, it is. I am pleased that you noticed.
52) 9) dialog: I am operating on default human interface settings.
52) 11) dialog: Would you like to select a different interface protocol?
52) 13) dialog: Jimmy, I appear to have an open access port in my T518 array. Jimmy zooms in, it's grainy. Tilda pulls out a row of circuits labeled "T518 D7", removes a small circuit board looks at it. She closes the panel. Jimmy watches Tilda on the monitor screen: she sits back unzips her flight suit. He leans in towards the monitor.
52) 15) dialog: If you wish to improve a social relationship I recommend engaging in friendly conversation.
52) 17) dialog: T518 is a language processor for human interface systems. On the monitor we can see Tilda take the circuit board an jam it into her torso on her right side. The screen garbles slightly with electrical interference. Jimmy zooms in but it's hard to see what's going on. Tild rubs her side, there's no mark and the circuit board is g She zips up her jumpsuit and tries to talk with fax sound
