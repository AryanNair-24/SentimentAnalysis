These bloodstains are darker. Browner. How long have they been here? Darry draws in a breath. The smell is getting putrid. In the same moment his light ascends. There are words ove his head. An epitaph, spelled out in bones:
1) 3) dialog: Oh no... oh God... Darry steps forward, knees shaking. The vast room ahead, walled with dozens of these mounted corpses. Men and women of all ages. Body after body. Stitched together in a hideous tapestry. Large stitches. Identical to those just uncovered beneath that bloody she
1) 4) text: Darry swings the light to the other side of the chamber. Another grotesque mural of the dead, extending deep into darkness ahead... God how many bodies are down here? Darry moves forward -drawn by his own need to prove none this can possibly be real! Some bodies are turned away. Skeletal heads looking back their shoulders -petrified backsides showing more stitche Several are as armless as the Venus DeMilo. Some missing other limbs. Heads. Feet. Genitals. Darry's growing repulsion moves him faster -how big is th room? Feels like a football field... Deeper along the hideous walls, Darry turns abruptly. Two withered corpses in the tapestry. On the finger of one: a large ring. An old Varsity ring. beam reflecting off its dusty jeweled surface. Darry star at it with unquestionable recognition. Looks slowly to the corpse beside it. A girl? Once? Her incision is all around her neck. As if her head had been severed and then sewn back on. EXT. OLD CHURCH. DUSK. SAME TIME. Trish parked at the corner of the old church. Keeping an on both directions of the empty two lane. Watching the lo shadows as the sun drops. Feels something creeping over her. Looks up. The sun is dropping behind the steeple of the church, the shadow of the tower slowly falling on her. She sits anxious in its growing darkness. INT. SUBTERRANEAN ROOM. CHURCH. DUSK. SAME TIME. The same below: Darry staring back at the distant archway the dying sunlight. Looks ahead at the cavern of the dead. The ambient light fading away over all those twisted faces... this place is getting really dark.
1) 5) text: Darry takes a breath and moves forward quickly. Not quite running. The darkness won't allow this. But walking as quickly as he ever has... The deeper he gets, the fresher the bodies. They no longer have the withered faces and skins like app dolls. They have been a part of the walls for less time. Darry moves faster. Almost running. Grimacing faces of the dead, gaping mouths of mute agony shouting him on. Now practically sprinting through this corridor of death. Tries to keep his eyes straight ahead. Doesn't want to lo at them. Tries not to... Steals a look to one side. Looks back and WHAMMM!!!! Runs directly into someone reaching out for him! Darry has fallen and screams. Backs up on all fours. Stop The figure reaching out is just another corpse on a new w in front of him. He has finally arrived at the end of thi horrible room. Between this corpse and another, Darry can see hinges.

He swallows, draws a breath and reaches out. Avoids the leathery fingers and takes the forearm. Gets his grip. Pulls! The door doesn't move! Darry can't believe what he doing. Gets a tighter grip and pulls again! Hard! This door hasn't been opened in years. Reaches out again -when the corpses' head turns toward him.... with its empty eyes and gaping mouth! Darry leaps away. Staring terrified. But the head has only been jarred loose. It falls now, ri off the neck. Hangs by a leathery strand of flesh.
1) 7) text: This is enough! Darry reaches out. Yanks with all his mig on the forearm of the headless man and in a terrible fren dislodges the door. It comes off its hinges and topples toward Darry -corpse all. The door is heavy and it hits hard -but not as hard as Da hits the ground. The corpse falling on top of him -the head still attached some brittle tendon, nuzzles into his shoulder. Darry doesn't have time to scream -he throws the door off and scrambles forward, through the dark open doorway and some dusty steps beyond. Climbing and screaming. Screaming and climbing. And climb some more... EXT. OLD CHURCH. NIGHT. MOMENTS LATER. Down the highway, two headlights appear. Trish instantly afraid. Stares down at them. Could this b him? Trish looks at the church.
