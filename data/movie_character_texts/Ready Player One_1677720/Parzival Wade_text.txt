1) 3) dialog: It’s very Nintendo. Their friendly rivalry requires busting on each other constantly.
1) 5) dialog: Weird that I’m still gonna outrace you. What does that say?
1) 7) dialog: Let’s see who makes it past 57th. A SIREN signals the drivers to get in their cars. Parziva makes a fist, Aech returns the salute.

3) 0) text: Parzival hangs a RIGHT on 8th Avenue and puts the pedal t the floor. On every block, a different obstacle emerges, each time another driver is taken out. SINKHOLES open at street, a MANIAC WITH A FLAMETHROWER sprays the intersect at 50th street, and at 54th street... A T-REX stomps out into the street and Parzival nimbly swerves between its legs, just as its massive jaws POP TH BLIMP. It’s not your typical street race. EXT. 57TH STREET —- CONTINUOUS Parzival turns right at 57th to get back over to Seventh Avenue, and now AECH suddenly BOMBS OUT OF NOWHERE and PA HIM. He flips Parzival the bird as he makes a left back onto seventh. Parzival settles in behind him. Up ahead, a few blocks away, is CENTRAL PARK. But before that is 58th street. The whole block is in an exaggerated state of construction, like an obstacle cours leading up to A COLLAPSING CRANE. It’s all a matter of timing and angle to get past the collapsing crane, and Aech tries to take it AS SHARP AND FAST as he can. He clears the falling CRANE, but he’s going too fast. He SKIDS OUT, and his car FLIPS OVER. A MOMENT LATER, Parzival DRIFTS PAST HIM, going just a bi slower. His DeLorean SKIDS, but he makes the turn.

Both are Japanese, in their twenties, bearing striking resemblance to one another. They each wear match suits of traditional samurai armor, a short wakizashi and longer katana strapped to their belts. They also drive matching Speed Racer cars. Parzival walks towards his DeLorean, in the center lane.

52) 1) dialog: I’m sorry. I should've said something, you’re my best friend. Here’s how to beat the first challenge... And while he explains...
55) 1) dialog: Hey Artemis... 48. Artemis looks up to see Parzival, standing on a ledge abo her, wearing A PAIR OF RED HEADPHONES. He tosses her a matching pair.
55) 2) dialog: Put these on. She puts them on and them Parzival pulls out a supremely ass RAIL GUN.
55) 3) dialog: Just bought this puppy. Check ‘er out. Parzival fires and the gun spits out a super-heated light wave that sprays like a shotgun. The blast incinerates everything in its path, except Artemis, who stands in the center of it, unharmed. An impressed Artemis looks up at Parzival.
55) 4) dialog: Headphones of limitless protection. Keep em, those are my spares. Parzival jumps down to the alley to join her, a fine mist vaporized IOI goons whirls through the air.

56) 22) dialog: No I wouldn't. (then) Are you a guy?
56) 24) dialog: I’m just saying, I don’t care what you look like. I'd like to meet you. I mean, I have no idea where you live, and I’m sure you'd be disappointed in me but...
56) 27) dialog: My real name is Wade.
56) 29) dialog: I’m not telling anyone. I’m telling you.
56) 32) dialog: Uh, yeah, I think it is.
56) 35) dialog: I don’t know, I mean, what wouldn’t I do? Buy myself the best rig, the biggest space ship... I’d get all the shit I could never afford.
56) 37) dialog: I'd keep it like it is, I guess, like it should be.
56) 39) dialog: I'm not really that into politics
56) 41) dialog: Yeah, I guess.

56) 45) dialog: Aech was right. I’m an idiot. (embarrassed) I thought... I thought you wanted to hang.
56) 47) dialog: That’s not-- nevermind. It’s cool. I better go. He pulls the miniature Vonnegut out of his pocket and TOS it into the middle of the street. It instantly expands to full size. Artemis is confused by his sudden attitude.
56) 49) dialog: Lemme think about it, okay? Artemis, bewildered, just watches as his ship rockets awa 53. Watching all this from a distance, the figure who was following them removes his hood. It’s NUMBER SIX.

60) 0) text: Parzival free-falls. A moment later, Aech joins him.
60) 2) dialog: I mean, they didn’t give me any warning.
60) 4) dialog: Don’t ask. Yes, they are still hurtling towards the ground at termin velocity, but the conversation is as casual as if they we chatting over coffee.
60) 5) dialog: I don’t really know anyone. Where do I even go? Where do I log in? Can’t believe my Aunt is doing this.

61) 6) dialog: I just don’t think the clue is that literal. Aech climbs on board his ship.

63) 28) dialog: So IOI would own the Oasis?
63) 30) dialog: But we keep Halliday’s rules? Equal access, equal bandwidth... Sorrento tightens, tries to smile. This is a bit of a sor subject.
63) 33) dialog: I’m sorry, no. Sorrento’s face falls. 63.
63) 34) dialog: I'm probably going to really regret this, but I can't do it.
63) 36) text: Parzival shrugs, “why not?” With a wave of his hand, Sorrento disables all the camera and microphones in the room. SORRENTO (CONT’D) The truth is, I had to make this offer. The Board insisted. But I was really hoping you would say no. Because if anyone wins, it’s going to be me. My avatar will get that egg, because the truth is, I am the only one with the balls to run this place right.
63) 37) dialog: Wow, you kind of switched gears there from “fairly reasonable” to “maniacal overlord”.
74) 5) dialog: Nope, not the answer. Aech turns to see Parzival entering, Artemis right behind him.
74) 7) dialog: Are they here?
74) 9) dialog: Shoto, Daito, this is Artemis. Artemis takes a small bow.
74) 10) dialog: Of all the gunters, Shoto and Daito are the two most skilled fighters I've ever seen. They're maxed out on all PVP categories. Shoto and Daito bow back to Artemis.
74) 11) dialog: You guys all got my message? Aech, are you someplace safe?
74) 13) dialog: Same for you two. If you're with us, they’1ll come looking for you. Parzival pauses, then addresses the group.
74) 14) dialog: A good friend told me that we would be better off working together. I didn’t listen to him. Aech is a bit embarrassed, he knows it’s him.
74) 15) dialog: I thought Halliday wanted us to do it alone, but that’s only how he would’ve done it. I think he wanted someone to be better than him.
74) 17) dialog: Yes. (to Artemis) But I’m not joining your clan. Artemis is confused. Wade turns to Shoto.
74) 18) dialog: (to Shoto) Not yours either. (to the group) We are the Clan. Right here in this room, this is the Oasis Dream Team. We're the “first five” and we are going to win this thing together or not at all. Murmurs of agreement from everyone, except Artemis.
74) 20) dialog: Does your Clan know how to find the second challenge?
74) 23) dialog: Yes. (to Artemis) 74. Don’t want to put you on the spot, but if you're with us, you’re with us. Artemis nods.
74) 26) dialog: There is no jump.
74) 28) dialog: “Where lovers wouldn’t leap.” It hit me today. It’s about a girl. (meeting Artemis’ eye) And the leap he didn’t take. Artemis doesn’t seem to get Parzival’s meaning, but Aech does.
74) 29) dialog: After they blew the Flunkie Sprat job, Halliday and Morrow met to work on a new idea. It was a seminal moment in history.
75) 4) dialog: I’ve watched the scene a million times, the night they sketched the plans for the Oasis. It took sixteen years to make it work, but this is where it began. Bored, Morrow leans back in his chair.
75) 10) dialog: This is the same girl Halliday was swooning over months before. He took her to a movie, but he still hadn’t taken the leap. Morrow shakes his head, it’s like pulling teeth with him.

77) 1) dialog: But if you know Halliday, you know that one of the first things he built in the Oasis was a place for his favorite movies. Our fabulous five come to a marquee with BLADE RUNNER: ORIGINAL EDITION on it.
77) 3) dialog: Something tells me there'll be more to it than that. They pass through the doors of the movie theater, and are suddenly transported to...
