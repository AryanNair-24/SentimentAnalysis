Most of the other racers are in STOCK CARS, every driver wearing the same helmet. These are SIXERS, we’ll get back to them later. Interspersed with the Sixers are vehicles of every variet And when I say every variety I mean that some of them are cars, and some of them are hover craft, and one of them i BLIMP with a jet engine on it. Their drivers are every size, shape and color, too. They called GUNTERS. That too will be on the quiz. The closer we get to the West Side of 7th Avenue, the mor Gunters there are. The second to last car is probably the most bad-ass of the lot, a replica of DECKARD’S SPINNER f BLADE RUNNER. AECH, a handsome guy with the shoulders of a linebacker, checks the OVERSIZED ENGINE strapped to the roof.

3) 0) text: Parzival hangs a RIGHT on 8th Avenue and puts the pedal t the floor. On every block, a different obstacle emerges, each time another driver is taken out. SINKHOLES open at street, a MANIAC WITH A FLAMETHROWER sprays the intersect at 50th street, and at 54th street... A T-REX stomps out into the street and Parzival nimbly swerves between its legs, just as its massive jaws POP TH BLIMP. It’s not your typical street race. EXT. 57TH STREET —- CONTINUOUS Parzival turns right at 57th to get back over to Seventh Avenue, and now AECH suddenly BOMBS OUT OF NOWHERE and PA HIM. He flips Parzival the bird as he makes a left back onto seventh. Parzival settles in behind him. Up ahead, a few blocks away, is CENTRAL PARK. But before that is 58th street. The whole block is in an exaggerated state of construction, like an obstacle cours leading up to A COLLAPSING CRANE. It’s all a matter of timing and angle to get past the collapsing crane, and Aech tries to take it AS SHARP AND FAST as he can. He clears the falling CRANE, but he’s going too fast. He SKIDS OUT, and his car FLIPS OVER. A MOMENT LATER, Parzival DRIFTS PAST HIM, going just a bi slower. His DeLorean SKIDS, but he makes the turn.

4) 10) dialog: No. (to Z, under his breath) Dude, act like you’ve met a girl before.
4) 14) dialog: My socially inept friend here was the first to 49th, first to 55th...
4) 22) dialog: The Iron Giant? Yeah, just got the commission for it. No big deal. Artemis checks out the surface of the enormous, stylized robot. The unfinished parts of it are still a 3D grid.
4) 24) dialog: (shrugging) It’s mostly about getting the right skins, what you can license, you know? Like Matrix, Matrix kids, forget it, but Star Wars, Marvel, Dark Knight, the classic Ridley Scotts...

4) 28) dialog: Yeah, tough to find.

4) 36) dialog: So you're checking my private Gunter stash - where's the quid pro quo? (off her look) The jump. Artemis debates whether or not to tell them.
4) 38) dialog: Exactly. That’s what I’ve been saying.
4) 41) dialog: The challenge is unwinnable. It’s designed to drive us nuts.
4) 44) dialog: No way, he never made mistakes.
4) 48) dialog: We’re gunters. “First to the key...”
4) 51) dialog: Thank you, I’ve told him a million times we'd be better off working together. But Z thinks the only way someone wins is solo.
4) 56) dialog: (aside, to Artemis) He gets a little touchy about the whole Halliday thing, thinks they have some sort of bond.
13) 3) dialog: S'up, Z? AECH now appears in a window in a close-up, clearly real footage. Wherever he is it’s loud and dusty, and bursts o smoke and gunfire make it difficult to see and hear.
13) 5) dialog: I'm trying to win the musket of infinite velocity.
15) 2) dialog: The South. But also Aliens. And the Roman Legion, I think. Aech is on the Union side, a musket with one hand, and a futuristic BLASTER in the other.
15) 4) dialog: Wish I could. 19. As he moves across the field, Aech shoots an Alien with h musket, then a Confederate soldier with his blaster. As t explode, their COINS shower to the ground. A VACUUM TUBE Aech’s shoulder sucks them right into his inventory.

41) 3) dialog: Yeah, but was it worth it? Those rigs are pricey.
41) 5) dialog: Worth it! Changed my mind. 37. Aech gives Parzival a triple-slap high-five, which in the 2040's is the cool way to do it. EXT.

He finishes off an ERUPTING VOLCANO and places it in the center of an ocean. Without turning around...
41) 7) dialog: Hey man, someone I want you...
41) 9) dialog: I'm working...
41) 11) dialog: (quickly) This is Parzival! 38.
48) 4) dialog: (not looking up) You told her.
48) 6) dialog: You told her! I can’t believe you told her.
48) 8) dialog: Have you seen the board? Artemis is on it. Aech snaps open a window. A live feed of The Scoreboard reveals Artemis’s name in the number two position.
48) 10) dialog: That’s not why you gave her the clue. Man, I can’t believe it. What happened to “Guy Friend before Female you want to Date”? And how much have I helped you?
48) 13) dialog: I don’t want it, okay? I’1l figure it out on my own. Parzival’s call alert starts beeping. He’s too embarrasse answer it.
48) 14) dialog: Well? You just gonna let it ring?

59) 2) dialog: I looked deep in my heart and realized, you’re my best friend. How can I stay angry? Aech looks over the edge. It’s at least ten thousand feet the ground. 56.
59) 3) dialog: Plus, you sounded kind of bummed when we talked.
60) 0) text: Parzival free-falls. A moment later, Aech joins him.
60) 1) dialog: So you gotta move out?
60) 3) dialog: That’s rough. How'd it go with the girl? Parzival shakes his head.
60) 6) dialog: You don't get to choose your family. But I'm your friend, even in the R.W. So if you need help, you call me, okay? Parzival looks over at Aech. Despite the fact that he loo like a linebacker and is falling through space at high sp he can see the sincerity behind his words.

74) 4) dialog: Gotta be the Brooklyn Bridge.
74) 6) dialog: Z! I was worried about you, man. He and Z do their elaborate high-five move. The one that really is cool. Aech nods to Artemis, somewhat less enthused. The feeling mutual.
74) 8) dialog: (nods ) They’re here. SHOTO and DAITO step forward.
74) 12) dialog: I’m on the run. 73. Parzival turns to Shoto and Daito.

85) 6) dialog: I know. Just don’t forget that, okay? When you meet me. Aech hangs up, leaving Wade wondering what he meant. 88.
88) 2) dialog: Hi Wade. Wade turns to see a heavyset African American girl, about Wade's age, with short kinky hair.
88) 4) dialog: I’m Helen. My Dad called me “Aech” and it stuck. Wade is shocked.
88) 6) dialog: Ugh. I knew you’d be mad. Grab a seat. Wade barely has time to sit down before Aech peels out.

92) 8) dialog: Sorrento’s got the second key!
92) 12) dialog: Excuse me?
95) 12) dialog: Course he did. He’s in full haptic feedback, he can’t tell where he is.
95) 15) dialog: Yeah, missed a spot or two. Aech points on one of the monitors. THE BACK OF SORRENTO’ HEAD is unfinished.
97) 2) dialog: Semi-bad news. Wade turns back to Aech, who has finished analyzing the I force field.
97) 3) dialog: The Force Field is from a spell in Gauntlet 2027, Magic and Physics proof. We can un-cast it, but only if we’re in close proximity.

99) 3) dialog: Can I just make a point here?
99) 5) dialog: The Sixers are at the castle on Doom, but they won’t take the key without Sorrento. So we have a short window to get out there... Wade shakes his head. 99.
