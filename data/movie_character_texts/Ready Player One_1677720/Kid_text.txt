SINKHOLES open at street, a MANIAC WITH A FLAMETHROWER sprays the intersect at 50th street, and at 54th street... A T-REX stomps out into the street and Parzival nimbly swerves between its legs, just as its massive jaws POP TH BLIMP. It’s not your typical street race. EXT. 57TH STREET —- CONTINUOUS Parzival turns right at 57th to get back over to Seventh Avenue, and now AECH suddenly BOMBS OUT OF NOWHERE and PA HIM. He flips Parzival the bird as he makes a left back onto seventh. Parzival settles in behind him. Up ahead, a few blocks away, is CENTRAL PARK. But before that is 58th street. The whole block is in an exaggerated state of construction, like an obstacle cours leading up to A COLLAPSING CRANE. It’s all a matter of timing and angle to get past the collapsing crane, and Aech tries to take it AS SHARP AND FAST as he can. He clears the falling CRANE, but he’s going too fast. He SKIDS OUT, and his car FLIPS OVER. A MOMENT LATER, Parzival DRIFTS PAST HIM, going just a bi slower. His DeLorean SKIDS, but he makes the turn.

A patchwork of solar cells cover the RV's ro along with a liberal amount of rust. The windows are tint black. The side door opens, revealing a short ASIAN KID who's wa too young to drive. He beckons Wade over.
