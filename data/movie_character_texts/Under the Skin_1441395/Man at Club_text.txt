Advancing through swirls of smoke, the rider slows into a gully where the smoke hangs thicker and billows in the intense heat and gusting chill. The wet road gleams with the reflection of flames swirlin above. Then he sees the pale figure lying there in the glistenin mud at the base of the roaring fire. He dismounts and removes his helmet. The BAD MAN. He hurries to her and lifts her up out of the mud. He looks into the body, not the face but the centre of th limp doll he is holding. He shakes it. Shakes it again until the eyes seem to open He helps her to her feet, helps her to recover, then stea her as they walk out of frame.

A thin, rectangular LINE OF PURE WHITE LIGHT about two mi long is held in perfect parallel with the horizon. It sits motionless a hundred and fifty feet above the surface, and three miles off shore. It is beautiful - as harmonious as it is worrying. Comple omnipotence. The sea beneath it is millpond calm. A gentle tide sweepi into the shore is all that can be heard. Far out, something is moving slowly towards us. A refract imperfection of the light on the water's surface. It is an object moving on the water towards us. As we watch its approach, we eventually see what it is. A BOAT. A fifteen-foot long, black, wooden skiff gliding towards Seemingly under its own steam as if a giant finger had propelled it. Soon it is in the shallows and the hull glides into a gri against the pebbles. From behind camera, the Bad Man enters frame. What tells us he’s not human is that he's not looking at thing in the sky. His attention is totally on the boat instead. As he reaches the bow, he drags it up onto the stones. The Bad Man now throws back a cover to reveal the Young Woman, vacuum-packed in transparent material. The Bad Man steadies the boat in the swell. He takes out knife, makes a few deft cuts in the packaging. There is no sudden gasping for air or dramatic coming to life. The naked female simply steps out of its plastic sheathing, and then from the boat onto the shore. The Bad Man throws a blanket round her. She waits there silently in the half-light with a look of abstraction. The Bad Man pushes the boat adrift again. The two figures turn and walk shoulder to shoulder up the beach. It's here, as we pan away from the sea to follow their wa that we see where we are. 10 The wild landscape of Northern Scotland. Not a word has been spoken, not a gesture imparted. The epic light in the sky remains. The figures emerge through a bluff of sand to find a whit transit van parked with its back to the sea.

She folds herself daintily past the heavy motorbike held place with industrial straps and between the hanging clot that make a crumpling sound above her. She clears a space between bags, empty shoeboxes and discarded undergarments. The Bad Man shuts the doors and we hear his footsteps mov around to the side of the van and get in. She pulls her angular limbs into some pants and a bra. The van trundles off as she gathers clothes from the collection that hangs about her. The things of the world are dressed onto her. Shirt, skir shoes, coat... She opens a box in front of her revealing documents and credit cards all bearing her photograph and the name “MS. LAURA FLYNN”. She begins to put them into a small handbag.

She glances at him from moment to moment as she weaves al these winding roads. He licks his lips nervously. Then edges a little closer towards her. His hand slides slowly across the seat. His fingertips furtively reach and probe at the edge of h thigh, half-frightened they might arouse rebuttal. He looks at her lasciviously, his tongue swelling in his head. He looks down at her smooth flesh, and gulps at the idea it. He eases the hem of her skirt a little higher. Laura looks down at her exposed thigh then up at him and eyes fixed on her flesh.

She backs out of her seat, lithe and supple, opens the do and eases out. The Bald Man eases out too, but he's less assured in ever way. As he drops down from the van, his thin shoes designed fo night out in whatever silly, little bar she found him in, land straight into a puddle. The water fills his shoes in a split second somehow snapp him out of his sexual stupor. She dangles her keys seductively as she moves towards the ruin of a house. He looks surprised by the place she's brought him to. It' million miles from the love nest he imagined. The house i crumbling wreck about ready for the bulldozer. He suddenly stops.

She turns in the doorway leaning forward, eyes wide saying “What's the problem! ?” Exasperated and still keyed up with suspicion, he looks i the darkness, peering past her and into it for a moment, silent, considering his options. 23 21.

On arrival at the bedraggled tent he dips inside, folds a the worn blanket and pillow, and without breaking rhythm, starts to dismantle the tent poles, pegs and cords. He moves inside and out expertly. Bit by bit it rolls away, creating a tiny bundle that fit under his arm. He stands and looks at the spot. All that is left is a flattened rectangle in the sand. The winds are already blurring the edges of the shape int obscurity. His task complete, he turns back towards the ridge of the dune and the car park it leads to. Thirty feet along the ridge, the Bad Man sees the boy has made his way to the path. The child is standing there in silent desperation, devour by fear. He shivers a little under the Bad Man’s gaze and his eyes roam about as he ponders what crying out actually achieve a situation like this. The Bad Man looks at the child without so much as a blink is covered with a dusting of sand especially around his n and mouth where his tears and slobbers have become caked grit. We can see he’s tried to eat the grass or dirt. His knees and hands are scratched from falling down and h face is weathered from exposure. His clothes are damp from the night in the open air. His reddened eyes are already lost in shock. 33 34. The Bad Man moves on. The toddler tries to follow as he passes by. A dry whimper murmurs at his back as he rouses himself. The Bad Man turns to look at ‘it’ with the sharp focus of scientific instrument. The way a microscope looks at a new germ or a jaded docto studies an X-ray. There is no meaning in his gaze, he is simply measuring equations, examining the possibilities for the most exped action. Satisfied, or rather having understood the probabilities fully, he simply turns away. After a dozen steps, the toddler realizes the Bad Man’s leaving. At first it is like a groan or a deep hum but as the dist between them opens, the power of the sound increases in a astounding way. He now experiences a squeal that reverberates on a cosmic level, a noise of such pitch as to stop the gulls in the to silence the waves. He hears it all the way to the motorbike and even as he k starts the engine the sound still cuts through. Does he drive away in haste? It's hard to say. Perhaps it just us wishing him to flee. Perhaps it would just be mor acceptable if he would, to escape this nerve-jangling how

The Bad Man then gets into the van and drives it out onto road. He pulls up a short way from the pound and gets out. He hands Laura the keys as she approaches and moves off towards his motorbike without a word. The charming grin and ebullient demeanor he showed to the pound employee is gone without a trace.

He takes a deep, terrified breath, holds his nose and put his head under. Laura stops, turns and moves back out of the blackness towards the stairs, collecting her clothes as she goes.

She reaches between his legs delicately. We see him respond to her touch. His back tightens and he moves with her gentleness to and fro. She kisses him on his neck. Then he kisses her face. Their tempo gently builds, becoming committed again. Hand sweeping over bodies, mouths locking together. 74 79.

She looks for all the world like someone dressing to go t work. She is distracted now as the man shifts. He murmurs and fidgets, something is disturbing his slumb She turns to watch him. His face is taught, his eyelids flicker with dreaming. She stands there like a scientist, observing. Now his lips mouth soft words, barely audible, distant.

On the deck, the Bad Man sits on a little bench, a differ motorbike parked nearby. It’s just as dark and powerful as the old one. The Bad Man is reading a local newspaper. His expression remains blank as he reads the headline: 76 77 81. “TERROR CRIME STRIKES HIGHLAND IDYLL. LOCAL GRANDMOTHER SHAKEN BUT DEFIANT.” We see his eyes fall down the page to a photograph of the little cul-de-sac now cordoned off by police tape. “Man beaten then kidnapped by ruthless assailant.” Below it is a picture of the motorbike he abandoned. The caption underneath says: “Driven by the kidnapper.” And inset, a picture of the number plate. Now we are looking up in a tight CU of the Bad Man’s face His eyes scan to the next image of police standing at the edge of a ravine. The report here asserts: “Kidnappers body found in the seat of stolen car after de plunge. His victim has not been found.” And then, at the end of a police statement about how: “Gang related violence is on the increase.” We read the words: “No leads.” The Bad Man folds the paper under his arm and looks out o the ice cold water and into the wild Scottish landscape. At the concrete slip on the far shore, people and cars wa for the ferry. A bell clangs its imminent arrival.

Just as we saw him at the start of the film as he raced t recover her predecessor, the Fire Woman. The bike roars as he pushes his wrists hard over the accelerators and the road dips under him. He lashes through gears and the bike feels the road again We are tight on the back-end now as a corner looms. He be leaning into it. Tendrils of hedgerow whip over his helmet. 81 82 88. The edge of the tire plumes with a little smoke as the we adjusts on the apex of the bend. Then more speed and vibration. Mechanical adrenalin. We are up ahead of the machine now looking back. See the undulating road and how the vehicle clings to it perfectly.

He takes stock, then pulls off the road, stops and dismou In the distance, on the next mountain, he can see the fai halo of a fire. He looks at it pondering.
75) 0) text: The Bad Man walks through the dense heather. A short distance away smoke rises from a tree, blackened still burning. He stops to study footprints, her footprints that weave i the mud. Tracing them backwards, he sees that they set off from th lake-side, so he walks towards them. He sees the footprints meander aimlessly at the waters ed He finds the place where she slept in the reeds. He crouches to see her form impressed in that swaddling n He moves on, following the prints. Longer strides now, and there joining them, heavy prints their wake. He follows them until the ground is churned and the littl footprints disappear into shrub. He looks towards the burnt tree, spitting with red embers and walks over to it. 83 89. He focuses on a large dark patch at its base, and notices tangible signs. A heel from Laura's shoe. The delicate mound that could be an elbow or ankle. He sees her charred belt buckle. And a melted button. He exhumes them and puts them in his pocket. He moves to a section of her charcoal hand. Finds the smoke-coated wedding ring on the brittle finger snaps it off. Conceals it in the same pocket. He surveys the Pompeii-ish remains. At the edge of the blackened circle lies the husk of her petrified face, fractured by the fury of fire. He applies his heel to it matter-of-factly. The black crust snaps underfoot throwing grey powder into air. He grinds the evidence into nothingness with his boot, nonchalantly. Like he's putting out a cigarette. All that's left is a black, formless blot on the earth an ghostly plume of dust. He turns now towards the muddy oily sludge at the edge of black ash, focusing on the woodsman's vehicle tracks. His gaze traces them to the lane and on towards heavy tir tracks that churn off into the distance. His dead gaze reaches out after them.

He opens them, then he lowers a small ramp from inside be steering the bike into it. He fastens the straps then he closes the doors. Then he reaches into a pocket and fishes out a phone. We see immediately it's the Woodsman's phone. On it of course, the only remaining image of ‘Laura’. Arriving close to the edge of the water he draws back and launches it into a long arching throw that ends in a splo The phone disappears into the And as we hear him climb into off, our focus remains on the time, the water is completely And it's as if nothing at all
