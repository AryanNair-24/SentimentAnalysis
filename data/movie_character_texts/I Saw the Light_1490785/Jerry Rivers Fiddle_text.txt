Through the years the name would always stay the same, but the players would change 20 times. For DON HELMS 20’S on pedal steel guitar and LUM YORK, 20’S o bass; JERRY RIVERS, 20s and one other player (considering Sammy Pruitt). Hank hunches over the microphone, all 150 pounds of him. he sings, his knees buckle, his hips thrust. For these da it’s unique. Visceral. And the sexuality cannot be denied yodels, a WOMAN shrieks. Rest of crowd laughs at that. IN THE WINGS is Hank’s MOTHER, LILLIE, 40’s, intense, formidable and nearly as tall as her 6 foot son. She wear simple black dress and ARGUES with Audrey. They don’t now and never have, liked each other. Lillie FLIPS THROUGH the last bills of “tonight’s take.” actually starts counting the crowd.
