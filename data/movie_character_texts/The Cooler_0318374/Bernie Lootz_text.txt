As Bernie limps toward his room, his neighbor, a low rent HOOKER, approaches from the opposite end of the courtyard with a huge-ass JOHN in tow. They converge at their doors at the same time.

The wa he goes about this is incredibly ceremonious. With as muc care as given to disarming a nuclear weapon. Natalie can't help but smile. Bernie lowers the needle to the first cut of the record. Everything seems to be going so well, until... SKREEEEEE! The needle skids across the surface of the rec with a sound worse than chalk on a blackboard. Bernie opens his mouth in a silent grimace... and a delic laugh comes out. It's Natalie's laugh. Talk about a tension breaker. Berni turns to her, shrugs. He tries again. This time the needl catches... and Sinatra takes command of the room. He's si "This Town," a finger snapping upbeat Valentine to Vegas. Marred only by a slight clicking caused by the scratch.
