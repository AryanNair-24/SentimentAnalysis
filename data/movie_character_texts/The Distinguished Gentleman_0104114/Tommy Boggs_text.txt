66) 19) dialog: I'm sure you do.
66) 22) dialog: Whoa, whoa, hold on, what about child safety?
66) 26) dialog: Great! About time! I     hate imported toys. What about food    additives? How about we block out   a few evenings, you can take   me through the details.
66) 32) dialog: Saturday night?
68) 0) text: The regular evening pickup basketball game. Even among these ruthless players, Tommy's street moves are outstand ingly down and dirty. His principal accomplice: Elijah Marshall.

70) 10) dialog: Nothing wrong with letting the chairman of the ethics committee roll you once in a while.
70) 15) dialog: So Eli, how come you haven't asked for my help with your amendments?
70) 17) dialog: (bristling)
70) 21) dialog: I'm no different from anyone else.
70) 23) dialog: You know, Eli, I like you, I really do. You remind me of my father.
70) 25) dialog: He thought I was scum, too. BELLS begin RINGING and LIGHTS FLASHING on all the clocks and sconces down the corridor. Three RINGS, pause, three RINGS, pause... Marshall does a U-turn. Tommy doesn't follow suit.

73) 3) dialog: Yes, it was.
73) 5) dialog: I voted "Nay." It's a terrible bill. It'd destroy the fabric of American life.

77) 2) dialog: No, I was just wondering how much of this is a statutory problem, and how much is a regulatory one? I mean, didn't the Merton Act cover most of this?
77) 4) text: Hmmm, that's an excellent point. Let me see something... As she starts rummaging in her briefcase, we TRACK AROUND to a COMPUTER SCREEN on Tommy's desk -- it displays THE EXACT WORDS HE'S JUST SPOKEN.
77) 6) dialog: Well, for Merton to apply you have to show high contagion...sounds to me like your contagion rates are no higher than the common clod. In b.g., Reinhardt DIVES FORWARD to his keyboard and begins correcting his typo. Celia looks puzzled.
77) 7) dialog: Common cold. (beat)

83) 0) text: Tommy and Celia walk over the bridge to the cherry trees by the Tidal Basin.
83) 1) dialog: So, how'd you end up hustling for Pro Bono instead of pesticides? I mean, you could have been a big- time lawyer, right?
83) 3) dialog: At a hundred grand a year, how depressed can you get? Doesn't it depress you to lose all the time?
83) 5) dialog: So why do you do it? She skips a stone on the water.
83) 7) dialog: Say it.
83) 12) dialog: Grandma like Jefferson. Y'know, "Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." It's a lot to live up to, so I specialized in the last part.
83) 14) dialog: Fine...'til I met you. Now...the better I do, the worse I feel. They have stopped walking.    They are standing close together. They kiss.
83) 15) dialog: So...when can I see you again? How about dinner Saturday night? She shakes her head.

88) 2) dialog: The Medical Association made a persuasive case. Ten grand from their PAC, plus Christmas in Aspen.
88) 4) text: Tommy -- if I'm not mistaken, you wouldn't be here without the good senior citizens of your district. You got to dance with the girl that brung you, son. If you have a bit of business to do, do it quietly... in the corridors... in the subcommittees... with little amendments. You mess around on the big ones like Medicare, you'll be dead meat on election day.
88) 5) dialog: Yeah, well, then it's thanks for the memories, and on to the next gig.
88) 11) dialog: Which is?
88) 13) dialog: Wait a minute. You're talkin' 'bout my re-election?

90) 0) text: Tommy and his staff listen to the Jubas.
90) 2) dialog: The others?

With him are Celia and the Jubas.
91) 4) dialog: This is Mickey's school?
91) 6) dialog: But isn't the school district responsible?
91) 8) dialog: Nice.
91) 10) dialog: Do you believe it?
91) 12) dialog: But why isn't it being investigated?
91) 14) dialog: Money talks.

94) 10) dialog: Why, thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, to tell you the truth, I didn't know you'd be on my side on those power lines.

94) 14) dialog: But you said --

94) 54) dialog: But there are studies that say --
94) 57) dialog: But what if you're wrong? As Tommy persists, Andersen looks increasingly angry.
94) 58) dialog: People didn't use to say smoking causes cancer, either. What if the evidence is just building, and some day we wake up and discover that your power lines are killing us?
94) 67) dialog: All I'm saying is, maybe we should hold hearings to look at --
94) 73) dialog: Maybe I should think about it.

98) 2) dialog: Oh, I don't know...
98) 4) dialog: How did you know that?
98) 8) dialog: That's not a question, is it?
98) 10) dialog: No, no -- I've still got my right nut, I can work with that.
99) 2) dialog: Sure, why not. Marshall takes a boiled crab from the platter between the places it on the butcher paper in front of him, christens it --
99) 4) dialog: You know, Eli, sometimes people do things they regret. Everyone makes mistakes. Fact is, Dick's been under a lot of pressure lately --
99) 8) dialog: What do you mean?
99) 10) dialog: I'm not a yes-man. When Dick says no, I say no. Marshall SMASHES down again with the mallet.    Crab carn

106) 3) dialog: Loretta!   Please! Your mouth!
109) 0) text: On the back floor, Tommy stirs. Seems to be okay. Lifts himself to see up front. The windshield is smashed. Loretta and Marshall are both unconscious. Tommy climbs into the front but can't get the door open. He kicks out a broken window and climbs through. He runs to a phone on the corner and dials 911.
109) 1) dialog: I need an ambulance right away. IN THE CAR no motion from Loretta or Marshall. AT THE PHONE he dials another number.
109) 2) dialog: Evening, Mrs. Dodge, Tommy Johnson here, sorry to call at this hour, is Dick back from the Gridiron dinner yet? Could I speak with him for just a moment?
110) 5) text: What's wrong? INTERCUT Tommy and Dodge.
110) 6) dialog: How did you know?

110) 10) dialog: No.   Someone else. Loretta. Dodge recovers his equilibrium.
110) 12) dialog: Yeah. She's out, too. I don't like the way it looks. For anybody. Look. You said you wanted to get back into Marshall's good graces. Well, here's an opportunity.

113) 9) dialog: No, someone screwed him --

113) 14) dialog: If you'd give me a chance to --
113) 18) dialog: Celia --
114) 3) dialog: Under. She tries her hand at a false shuffle.
114) 4) dialog: Not bad, kid.    You've got potential.
114) 6) dialog: I am. He takes the deck from her, fans it face up, pulls all th kings and aces, stacks them on top, and squares the deck.
114) 7) dialog: This is one's called the double duke. How many players?
114) 9) dialog: Who's the mark?
114) 13) dialog: Your deal. She deals out six hands in a circle on the ground.
114) 14) dialog: Look at the sucker's hand. She turns over the hand at number two.   It has the four kings. Mickey WHISTLES at the hand.
114) 15) dialog: Look at your hand. She turns over her own hand. It has the four aces. Mickey looks at the power lines, at the hands, at TJ. Then, understanding:

Armando -- find out how fast I can get from Longworth to my office. Loretta -- we need some scoop from the EPA for the roper, I'll give you a list. Van Dyke -- call Hattie at the Silver Foxes, and --

115) 22) dialog: My man! The others come to the window to see Homer, still wearing his fuel-smeared overalls, and SHOUT greetings.

116) 5) dialog: I owe you one.

117) 10) dialog: (laughs)
117) 15) dialog: (to Homer)
117) 18) dialog: Okay. Sunday. Fifth race at Del Mar. Blueboy is running twenty to one. I'd take a major position.
117) 20) dialog: No, not at all -- my Cousin Henry spends his days pumping water into horses' stomachs and stuffing Percodan up their butts. Trust me. Reinhardt is interested in this.   And he admires Tommy's m.o.
117) 27) dialog: Why did the White House change its mind?
117) 29) dialog: Is there new evidence?
117) 31) dialog: And what good is this to me?
117) 35) dialog: I ain't got no Cousin Henry.
119) 2) dialog: Got a minute, Dick? Tommy takes him aside.    The room empties except for the
119) 3) dialog: Listen, Dick, I heard something. There's got to be some bid'ness in it. Tommy very discreetly gestures with his thumb and palm: money.
119) 4) dialog: Maybe we can go in on it together.
119) 6) dialog: The EPA is going to make a stink about power lines. The White House is pushing them to do a big study.
119) 8) dialog: (acting surprised)
119) 9) text: Nothing gets by, do it? Tommy touches his nose, in tribute to the master.
119) 13) dialog: I -- I hope it wasn't my press conference that started this.

126) 6) dialog: The EPA's fixing to make a big stink about power lines and cancer. They're going to serve us up for breakfast.
126) 8) dialog: Proof don't mean shit. We're talking politics. They make a federal case out of power lines, I'm screwed. Whole insurance business is screwed. You know how much cash I'd have to pay out in settlements? Even if I stiffed everybody on claims, the legal fees'd be enough to kill me.
126) 12) dialog: You better believe it. You're screwed, too. Every hot dog trial lawyer in America soon be lining up to sue both our asses. We got to move on this, Olaf. If I wasn't tied up here, I'd go to Washington myself. Shouldn't you be getting on a plane? Just between us -- you find a way to stop this, I'll find a million bucks if I have to.

134) 3) dialog: He's do that?
134) 5) dialog: Good thinking. They return to the corridor.     Tommy looks at his watch
134) 6) dialog: Say, Reinhardt, my Grandma's plane comes in at ten. You wouldn't mind picking her up and driving Miss Daisy around, would you?

136) 30) dialog: Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the other members of this committee, and on behalf of myself, I have a very personal statement to make. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you -- thank you for your leadership, for your insight, for your boldness... Dodge preens for the cameras, until:
136) 31) dialog: ... and for your courage. Especially your courage.
136) 34) dialog: Your courage in exposing the corruption that eats away at this institution. Your courage in taking on the special interests. Your courage in taking a major new step --
136) 36) dialog: You're    right -- integrity isn't new to you,    Mr. Chairman, it's second nature    to you. Still it's a rare public    servant who'll take on the special    interest money, take on the PACs -- ANDERSEN, wary, senses danger.
136) 37) dialog: take on the lobbyists and fat cats -- CELIA is fascinated.
136) 40) dialog: ... and who'll stand up instead for ordinary American citizens...
136) 42) dialog: ... the plain people who just want peace of mind -- who just want to know they're raising their kids in safe neighborhoods and sending them to safe schools. ON THE DAIS Dodge wants to wrap this up.
136) 43) dialog: Yes, courage, Mr. Chairman, is a quality that you have in abundance --
136) 45) dialog: (undeterred)
136) 46) text: Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, the Chairman and I had a meeting in his office with Olaf Andersen of Gulf Coast Power, and his lobbyist, Mr. Tommy O'Connor -- (indicating)
136) 51) dialog: One million dollars, if we would stop the EPA from investigating the connection between power lines and cancer clusters.
136) 54) dialog: Isn't that right, Mr. Andersen? Tommy flicks his eyebrows at Andersen, provocatively, imitating Dodge.
136) 58) dialog: Oh, yes, you can. As Mr. O'Connor said to you, quote: "If that's what you want, we can always find a loophole. No one will know." Remember saying that, Tommy?
136) 61) text: I insist that the gentlemen yield! Tommy also stands, and produces a video tape.
136) 62) dialog: You can't deny it, Mr. Andersen! We have the whole thing on this tape! The room erupts. THE PRESS loves it. Still cameras CLICK and WHIR. DODGE despairs. REINHARDT puts his hand over his face.
136) 63) dialog: Yesterday, at Chairman Dodge's courageous suggestion, I taped the whole conversation. It's all there. Mr. Chairman, I thank you. The people thank you. America thanks you.
136) 67) text: we have exposed a canker at the very heart of democracy. APPLAUSE. Tommy is amazed at Dodge's survival skills. REINHARDT, delighted at the turn, claps heartily. ANDERSEN, livid, leaps up and shouts at Dodge.
138) 10) dialog: (acting astonished)
138) 23) dialog: I owed you one. Dodge wheels on Tommy, exploding.
138) 31) dialog: You know what? He's right!     But let me tell you something --   all that's nothing, compared to   what I pulled here in Washington...   and this shit's all legit!
138) 36) dialog: Adjourned? Fine. Leave. (indicating cameras)
138) 38) dialog: (to the room)
139) 1) dialog: Now don't get me wrong. They're not all bums. But boy, do the rotten fish stink up the barrel. Marshall APPLAUDS.   The Man in the next bed joins in.
140) 1) dialog: Now tell me, people -- while these guys are buying and selling each other, who's standing up for you?
140) 5) dialog: I'll tell you who. Nobody! Nobody gets five hundred bucks an hour to lobby for the average Joe! There's no Shnook PAC! There's no National Association for Ordinary Assholes! Sure, everyone's against cancer, but "everyone" doesn't have an office on K Street! (to committee Members)
140) 6) text: Don't you folks get it? We're supposed to be the people's lobbyists. Congress is supposed to be America's political action committee. APPLAUSE and SHOUTS of support. Several Members on the dais join the applause, seeing a winning issue. CELIA shakes her head in wonder. Tommy goes to Mickey and stands her up on a chair.
140) 7) dialog: She's right. Throw the bums out -- starting with me! I'm gonna found me a new party. The Don't Vote For Me Party. Any of y'all want to join up? APPLAUSE and CALLS of enthusiasm.
140) 8) dialog: Well, come on, then! C'mon, get up, we got work to do! The room erupts, electrified, chanting.
141) 0) text: Tommy and Celia walk down the steps, arm in arm.
141) 2) dialog: Why? I bought it this morning. It's blank. As they continue down the steps, CAMERA CRANES UP to WIDE SHOT of the Capitol and the town beyond.
