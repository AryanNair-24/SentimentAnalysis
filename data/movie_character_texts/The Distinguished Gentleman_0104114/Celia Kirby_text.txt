55) 0) text: A beautiful black woman, 20s, walks briskly down the busy Cannon corridors. CELIA. There's intelligence in her eyes, and fire.
56) 0) text: It's packed, mainly with men.  Everyone has drinks and talks noisily. It looks like  a fraternity smoker for lobbyists. MUSIC comes from  a boom box. The bar -- a tablecloth over some desks -- is lavishly stocked. So are the bookcases, which now look like liquor store shelves. ANGLE ON LORETTA, in a cocktail dress and a HELLO MY NAME IS MISS LORETTA badge, staffing a little table, handing Celia a name-tag.
56) 1) text: Celia's hands print CELIA KIRBY.    PRO BONO. BACK TO SCENE - ON Tommy and Reinhardt talking with a LOBBYIST.
56) 18) dialog: Wow! That's smooth. After ten straight hours on my feet making small talk and breathing cheap cigar smoke, that's exactly the kind of line I'm ready to fall for.
56) 20) dialog: Sure, sure, forget it. Can you just tell me, which one's Congressman Johnson?
56) 24) dialog: Oh. I see. So tell me, Congressman, just how deep is the shit I'm standing in? Tommy has to laugh.
56) 26) dialog: Celia Kirby. I'm the legislative director of Pro Bono.
56) 28) dialog: (amused)
56) 31) dialog: I want an appointment, Congressman, not a date.
56) 33) dialog: No thanks.   I really should be going.
56) 37) dialog: I'm afraid I'm busy.
56) 39) dialog: No thanks. (extending her hand)
66) 0) text: Tommy and Reinhardt meeting with Celia and an elfin guy in corduroy.
66) 1) dialog: Thank you for seeing us, congressman, we won't take up much of your time. This is Ira Schecter, our research director.
66) 3) dialog: But you have people waiting, and --
66) 5) dialog: Well. She pulls documents from her briefcase and hands them to Tommy.
66) 6) dialog: These are issue papers. This session we're targeting auto insurance premiums, child safety, and food additives.   As votes come up, we know you'll be hearing plenty from the other side. We'd just like a clean shot at making our case, too.
66) 10) dialog: (rising)
66) 20) dialog: (rising)
66) 23) dialog: Well, we're sponsoring a bill imposing safety standards on imported toys...
66) 28) dialog: (to him)
66) 34) dialog: Fine. Wednesday morning.      Nine- fifteen.
75) 0) text: A briefing in progress. Flip charts, ring binders, Celia, Ira, a couple of other Pro Bono types. Tommy is riveted by Celia.
75) 1) dialog: It comes down to a question of what is acceptable risk. Are we willing to feed our kids a substance that causes cancer in lab rats? More important, who gets to make the decision? Bureaucrats and big corporations, or the people whose lives depend on it? THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            64.
77) 0) text: Celia continues her briefing.
77) 1) dialog: ...And in the 1988 study, it was up to eight per hundred-thousand. Um...am I losing you on these mortality rates?
77) 3) dialog: (surprised)
77) 5) dialog: Wow...you're right. Maybe we can get them to amend Merton-Simmons. RACK FOCUS...reveals REINHARDT in b.g., sitting at another computer terminal. He is typing in Tommy's responses, which appear on Tommy's screen.
77) 9) dialog: I see. Well, I must say I'm pretty impressed.
77) 13) dialog: Oh come on...
82) 0) text: Celia at her desk in the somewhat ratty Pro Bono offices.
82) 1) dialog: Where did you go?
82) 4) dialog: More like the Petroleum Institute Ski Cup, the NRA Open, the --
82) 6) dialog: I can't -- we're having a press conference.
82) 10) dialog: (laughing)
83) 0) text: Tommy and Celia walk over the bridge to the cherry trees by the Tidal Basin.
83) 2) dialog: Oh, I was for a while.   It... depressed me.
83) 4) dialog: Sometimes. Mostly it gets me angry. And the anger keeps me going. Sure, I wouldn't mind winning a few. And it's not like I'm allergic to money...
83) 6) dialog: God, it's so embarrassing to come out and say it.
83) 8) dialog: Meaning. I need my life to mean something.
83) 11) dialog: My question is, how'd you get named after a Memorial?
83) 13) dialog: And how's the pursuit going?
83) 16) dialog: How about Sunday morning?
85) 0) text: On the steps, Marshall shakes hands with his Congregants. Tommy and Celia exit the church. Marshall takes Celia by the hands and kisses her familiarly. Tommy is taken aback.
85) 2) dialog: I liked the sermon, Uncle Eli.
91) 0) text: Children playing on swings and seesaws in a small public park. TILT UP. A pair of electric power derricks carrying 225,000-volt lines almost directly overhead. The derricks cast shadows across a nearby school. We SEE the neighborhood. Quite a few FOR SALE signs. A house with a moving sale in progress on the front lawn. ON Tommy taking it all in.   With him are Celia and the Jubas.
91) 11) dialog: It's impossible to know. No one's really looked into it hard enough.
91) 13) dialog: Why didn't they investigate breast implants all those years? What about those side-effects of that sleeping pill, Halcion? Why isn't anything being investigated? It's always the same.
91) 15) dialog: You got it.
91) 19) dialog: Don't tell me you're actually developing a conscience.
91) 21) dialog: No, that's not fair. Some people on the Hill actually believe in things, and try to do a decent job, and don't forget why they went to Washington, and who sent them.
91) 25) dialog: Make a stink. Round up some Members and hold a press conference. Get that committee of yours to hold hearings. Haul in in the Environmental Protection Agency, the Surgeon General, the National Academy of Sciences. Get the issue on every breakfast table in America.
93) 0) text: Tommy and Celia are watching the press conference on TV.
93) 1) dialog: Well, congratulations. You've found yourself your own hopeless cause.
96) 0) text: Tommy slips into bed next to Celia, who's half asleep.
96) 1) dialog: Mmmm...
96) 5) dialog: So what did he say?
96) 7) dialog: Dodge.    The hearings.
96) 11) dialog: Oh.
113) 0) text: Tommy races down the corridor.   Ahead of him, Celia, coming out of Marshall's room.   She freezes at the sight of him.
113) 3) dialog: Get away from him. He approaches her.
113) 4) dialog: And get away from me.
113) 6) dialog: Go away!
113) 8) dialog: You were set up? You were in the car! I didn't hear your name on the news!
113) 10) dialog: "Someone"?
113) 12) dialog: Yeah -- it's you! You don't give a damn about anything! And to think, the other night, I actually thought you cared about someone else. He puts his hand to her face.    She brushes it off.
113) 13) dialog: Not me, you jerk -- Mickey Juba! You caved on those power lines, didn't you? I knew it. Damn it, I knew it! What did you get for it? Tommy O'Connor's box at the Redskins? Someone slip you a condo in the Virgin Islands?
113) 17) dialog: God, I hate this town -- the only reason I stay is because I hate it so much.
113) 19) dialog: Get the hell out of here.
131) 0) text: Dodge and Tommy work the room genially. Tommy spots Celia talking to some Guests and goes over to her.
131) 4) dialog: (to Guests, smiling)
131) 8) dialog: (baffled)
131) 11) dialog: But why? He gives her an enigmatic smile and slips away. As he rejoins Dodge, Tommy SEES WARBURTON enter the room. Alarmed, TOmmy moves in on Dodge, steering him to avoid the EPA Administrator.
136) 3) text: It's very hot. Electric cars. CELIA is seated with Ira, her Pro Bono associate.
136) 4) dialog: I'm cutting out early.
136) 7) dialog: You got that right. AT THE DAIS Tommy has a private word with Dodge.
138) 11) text: Mr. Chairman! You mean to say you did all that stuff? You took all that money? Shock in the room. Some BOOS. IOWA does a nice HOG CALL. TJ sends a little wave and smile to Celia.
140) 6) text: Don't you folks get it? We're supposed to be the people's lobbyists. Congress is supposed to be America's political action committee. APPLAUSE and SHOUTS of support. Several Members on the dais join the applause, seeing a winning issue. CELIA shakes her head in wonder. Tommy goes to Mickey and stands her up on a chair.
140) 13) dialog: Tommy Johnson. Kamikaze congressman.
141) 0) text: Tommy and Celia walk down the steps, arm in arm.
141) 1) dialog: I can't wait to see that tape you made. Tommy pulls it from his pocket, glances at it, and tosses it away.
