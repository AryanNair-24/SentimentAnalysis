19) 15) dialog: I see. Well, I'm going to have to pass. I'm good, thanks.
19) 18) dialog: Listen um... (i.e. what's your name?)
19) 26) dialog: I don't think this is going to happen, Mrs. Moon.
19) 29) dialog: Yeah, I'd hate to bring bad luck to Flint Michigan. Lucy has sprayed some WHIP CREAM on her nipples.
19) 31) dialog: I can't eat dairy. Lucy decides that now is a good time to aggressively KISS him. Monix pushes her away.

33) 27) dialog: Sounds like a great arrangement.
33) 29) dialog: I'm pretty sure we have a game tomorrow.
33) 31) dialog: Well, if this is really going to be my life, I might as well be stoned like everyone else.
33) 33) dialog: What the Hell is this?
33) 40) dialog: It's harsh.
33) 42) dialog: Take what back?
33) 45) dialog: Your Mom grew this?
33) 47) dialog: Well, I'm finished, thanks.

37) 10) text: 52 -2- (Monix ducks and punches) (cuing the announcers) AND WE'RE ON. THE 'RED LIGHT' GLOWS.
38) 3) dialog: --This is bullshit guys. They're kicking our ass in basketball and they're kicking our ass during the commercials, too. Does anybody here understand the concept of the pick and roll? Because they're going to keep double teaming at the top of the key until somebody rotates the Damn ball...
38) 10) dialog: Does anyone in this room have any pride? Don't you realize, this is thelast four weeks of basketball anyus are ever going to play?Is thishow we're really going togo out?You'd think we'd want toend ourcareers battling, hustling after every loose ball. Boxing out under the boards. Setting picks for our teammates. But we haven't done shit out there. Twiggy Munson and Scootsie Double-Day hang their heads.
38) 11) dialog: We're a bunch of selfish assholes -- And I've got news for you, we aren't going to finish in fourth, we're going to finish dead last. Monix paces in front of the guys, a man possessed.

41) 26) dialog: You mean, like, pass?
41) 28) dialog: Sorry kid. Even if I wanted to play harder, this knee won't let me.

42) 2) dialog: Thanks. You too.
43) 2) dialog: I know what it takes to be a real team, Lynn.
43) 5) dialog: It doesn't matter. The truth is, I hate basketball right now.
43) 7) dialog: Why would I hate myself?
43) 9) dialog: You hate me for that. Not me. Lynn just stares at him.
43) 10) dialog: Okay, maybe I hate myself a little.
43) 12) dialog: I rode the bench through the playoffs, Lynn.
43) 19) dialog: Riding the bench was the greatest moment of my career?
43) 21) dialog: What else did I do?
43) 24) dialog: So, I should be proud of running the scout team?
43) 26) dialog: He was being a nice guy. The bench is the bench.
43) 33) dialog: That's right.
43) 36) dialog: Watch that needle.

43) 40) dialog: Why are you doing this? What does any of this matter, anyway?
43) 42) text: God, I wish I hated you as much as you hate yourself! Lynn throws the needle. Monix dodges it.
44) 36) dialog: Thanks Jackie. (to the team) The way I see it, any team in this league can put together a run. Most of our opponents are all flash. If we play unselfish, fundamental basketball, we can win games.
44) 43) dialog: Yes. Unselfish. Unselfish meaning tough team defense, full and half court traps, boxing your man out to help the team rebound. (BEAT)
45) 1) dialog: The most important work we do on the court is away from the basketball. Monix FLIPS OPEN A SWITCH BLADE KNIFE AND STABS THE BALL, deflating it. This gets everyone's attention.
45) 2) dialog: (re: deflated ball) Until you start moving like a real team, you practice without a ball.
45) 8) dialog: Alright, Clarence, run the offense.
45) 10) dialog: Set a pick for somebody. Clarence jogs over and stands next a scout team opponent.
45) 11) dialog: Okay, that's kind of a pick, I guess. Try standing on the other side of Scootsie's man, so you free him up to cut into the lane. Monix corrects Clarence, moving his body the way he wants to stand.
45) 12) dialog: Widen your stance. Plant your feet. Hands back. Like this. Now Scootsie GO. Set a pick for Jackie. Scootsie cuts across the lane. The team slowly gets i rotating faster.
45) 13) dialog: Now Jackie pick Bee Bee's man, and rotate to the rim like this... Everyone move to the open space. And Clarence you swing back out up top. They've completed the play. Monix stands there, smiling. players look at each other, what's the big deal?
45) 14) dialog: You know what that was?
45) 16) dialog: A flash to the high side post with an outside screen and a back door cut. Let's do it again.
45) 22) dialog: I'm saving my knee for the games. Coach's decision. NOW RUN. Clarence sets a screen for Scootsie and they perform the basic rotation.
45) 23) dialog: (as they run) We're not just rotating, we're clearing out, making space. A pass and cut can change defensive match- ups. Creating seams can give us back door looks. Down screens can make a team vulnerable to penetration.
45) 27) dialog: You don't have to understand it yet. Just run it again. You heard me -- AGAIN.
47) 8) dialog: No. We're running this play. We're running this play until we puke.
47) 11) dialog: 'Until we puke' is not a figure of speech. We are literally going to puke.
47) 16) dialog: No. No talking.
47) 18) dialog: 
47) 20) dialog: (as they run) We need to get in shape fellas. And we need to learn some fundamentals quick. -- AGAIN! They run it again, getting more and more winded.
47) 26) dialog: I want you to be brain dead. Because someday you're going to be too tired, or too nervous to think - - AGAIN! And when you are, this is the play I'm going to call. The play that your lungs and legs will have memorized. We will be able to run this in our sleep. Clarence tries to gag himself with his fingers.
47) 27) dialog: HEY! No sticking your fingers down your throat, Clarence, I saw that. You're going to puke. And it's going to be all natural -- AGAIN!
49) 0) text: JACKIE IS THE LAST PLAYER LEFT. He crawls across the gym floor, dying. Monix screams down at his deflated body.
49) 1) dialog: 
49) 5) dialog: Fuck you.
49) 7) dialog: Get up and run. You're going to puke like everybody else.
49) 9) dialog: We'll. talk after you puke. GO!
49) 16) dialog: Yes you can. Go. Jackie crawls harder along the hardwood.
49) 18) dialog: What are you talking about?
49) 20) dialog: That makes no sense. Everyone has thrown up before.
49) 22) dialog: That's bullshit. Keep moving, you're going to puke.
49) 24) dialog: What about when you were a baby? Babies throw up all the time.
49) 26) dialog: No way.
49) 33) dialog: Isn't that kind of dangerous?
49) 35) dialog: What happens if you swallow poison?
49) 37) dialog: Stand up. Jackie manages to stand up.
49) 38) dialog: Have you ever been punched in the Jejunum?
49) 40) dialog: It's part of your small intestine.

51) 1) dialog: .On offense, we share the ball. We look for the easy pass, not the spectacular pass... Jackie rolls off the pick and looks for it. For the first time in this sequence, we see the ball. Clarence has a cl passing lane -- He feeds Jackie for a lay up.
51) 7) dialog: . If a guy's more open than you are, he gets the ball... Instead of celebrating, Clarence hustles back on Defense. Tropics execute a half court trap. As we watch Monix play continue to the voice over from practice...
51) 8) dialog: .On defense, we're going to learn to play together. We're going to use team traps to pressure people into turnovers. On the in bounds, Monix and Jackie Moon trap an opponent. Monix slaps the ball free. He flips to Clarence who fakes fast break dunk and dishes to Scootsie.
51) 13) dialog: (huddling up) Listen up. I'll in-bound. Clarence, protect the ball and penetrate if you can. Kick it out to Scootsie or me and everyone crash the boards hard. Looking good, we're thirty seconds away from taking this one home. Let's bring it in.
51) 21) dialog: What the Hell is he talking about?
51) 23) dialog: What?
51) 26) dialog: I don't give a shit. We're taking it to them.
51) 29) dialog: I don't give a shit about the corn dogs, okay? We play hard every second. We're running the offense. Everyone got that? Everyone nods. WHISTLE!
52) 55) dialog: Rotate further out from the key, so when you get the ball you can face the basket. You've actually got some moves, so you can penetrate... FLINT RALLIES AROUND THEIR TEAM: The guys in Hawaiin shir are out flyering.
52) 70) dialog: Clarence, do me a favor, if you dunk the ball, don't dance afterwords. Act like you've been there before.
52) 73) dialog: Fine, you can dance a little bit.
