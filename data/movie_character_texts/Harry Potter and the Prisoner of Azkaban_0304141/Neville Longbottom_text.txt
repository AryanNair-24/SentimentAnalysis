38) 0) text: Harry, Ron and Hermione sit on fat little pouffes ina murky, incense-laden room, along with Neville, Dean, Seamus, LAVENDER BROWN, PARVATI PATIL and others. (CONTINUED )

42) 11) dialog: You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
44) 14) dialog: Profter... Snafpt...
44) 16) dialog: Professor Snape. Everyone LAUGHS good-naturedly. Lupin nods thoughtfully.
44) 20) dialog: Yes, but I don't want the Boggart to turn into her either.
44) 22) dialog: (closing his eyes) She carries a red handbag...
44) 27) dialog: R-r-riddikulus! CRACK! Snape stumbles in a FLASH OF LIGHT and reappears... in a LONG, LACE-TRIMMED DRESS, TOWERING MOTH-EATEN HAT, and CRIMSON HANDBAG. Instantly, the class ROARS (except for Draco and his fellow Slytherins). Neville blinks, amazed, then slowly, grins himself. Lupin drops the needle on an OLD GRAMAPHONE.

47) 0) text: The Hall buzzes with tales of Hogsmeade, as students swap stories, sample sweets, and send SOAP BUBBLES of all shapes, sizes and colors into the air. A MARIONETTE of a HARLEQUIN cavorts atop the Gryffindor table, moving its limbs in response to the STRANDS of LIGHT that extend from Neville's fingertips. Seamus passes his hand through the light beams and -- FLUMPH! -- the Harlequin collapses. (CONTINUED )
51) 4) dialog: But he keeps changing the password. Twice just this morning! I've taken to keeping a list. As Neville holds up a wrinkled piece of parchment, Harry, Ron and Hermione begin to exit.
63) 0) text: The CELLAR DOOR EASES open -- but no one appears. We TRACK THROUGH a sweet tooth's dream, SWARMING with customers. Up ahead, Neville prepares to lick the LOLLIPOP in his hand, when it simply floats from his fingers and out the door...
81) 11) dialog: I'm afraid so, ma'am. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL (to the group at large) While we know Sirius Black is gone tonight, I think you can safely assume he will, at some future time, attempt to return. Let me be clear. You are not to move about the castle alone. And you are not to write down the password! Understood! A collective nod of the head. McGonagall gives the ties of her robe a sharp tug, collects herself, and exits. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL Very well then. Go to bed. As the students drift off, Ron casts a last angry glance toward Hermione, who now holds Crookshanks in her arms.

135) 2) dialog: Harry! Wherever did you get it!
137) 2) dialog: Yeah. Let's see. Harry mounts the broom. Licks his finger and jabs it in the air. A few others do the same. Hagrid does the same. Crabbe and Goyle start to do the same, when Malfoy SLAPS their hands down. Finally, Harry places his hand on the broom. Sets his grip. Takes a breath. And... Frowns.
