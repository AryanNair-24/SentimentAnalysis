20) 5) dialog: That's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. (cooing to the cat) It's all right, Crookshanks. You just ignore the mean little boy... Then, sensing another presence in the room, both turn.
20) 6) dialog: Harry.
21) 0) text: As Ron smoothes the dog-eared clipping onto the table, Harry studies it. Hermione ignores it, stroking Crookshanks.

24) 6) dialog: Seems to be. Why? What is it, Harry?
26) 0) text: Ron and Hermione stare at Harry, faces stricken in the lantern light that now glows in the compartment. Crookshanks slumbers in his CAGE.
26) 3) dialog: But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean... eventually?
26) 5) dialog: Why're we stopping? We can't be there yet... Harry rises, slides open the door, peers into the corridor. HARRY'S POV -- All along the carriage, HEADS look out curiously. Then -- the train JERKS -- the car SWAYS -- and the LAMPS running along the ceiling FLICKER and...
28) 5) dialog: Ouch! Ron, that was my foot! SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK. Ron, a dark silhouette against the window, wipes a patch of condensation from the window.
28) 12) dialog: Harry? Harry, are you all right? Hermione's troubled face hovers above him. He nods. Sits up. Ron -- pale, nervous -- extends his hand. Harry's glasses.
28) 17) dialog: It was searching the train, Harry. For Sirius Black.
28) 25) dialog: I was trembling. Cold. But then... Professor Lupin made it go away...
28) 27) dialog: No one was screaming, Harry. Harry looks to the window and we PUSH IN ON his REFLECTION. It becomes a GLIMMERING PUDDLE and...
30) 5) dialog: Of course! That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.

38) 5) dialog: (under her breath) What rubbish. Ron spins. Frowns at Hermione.
38) 7) dialog: Me? I've been here all along.
39) 4) dialog: Death omens. Honestly. If you ask me, Divination's a very wooly discipline. Now Ancient Runes. That's a fascinating subject.
39) 6) dialog: A fair few.
39) 8) dialog: Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once? (mimicking Trelawney) Broaden your minds...

42) 10) dialog: Achintee? That's not far from here...

47) 16) text: As Harry, Ron, and Hermione climb the stairs, they find a crowd gathering on the Seventh Floor landing.
52) 7) dialog: But, sir, we've only just begun learning about Red Caps and Hinkypunks. We're not meant to start nocturnal beasts for weeks --
52) 14) dialog: Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice in the matter. Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and responds only to the call of its own kind -- Malfoy lets out a LOW HOWL.
53) 8) dialog: No!!! Harry and broom tumble in opposite directions. The Nimbus soars end over end, tossed by the currents, then drops... right into the Whomping Willow. FLOOMPH! Harry, in freefall, drops through one cloud, then another. Plummeting through the circling Dementors. Then... a TALL FIGURE rises from the crowd. Raises an OPEN HAND to the heavens. Eyes angry but clear. Dumbledore. An EXPLOSION -- more powerful than thunder -- rocks the air. A FLASH -- more fierce than lightning -- shocks the sky. And then... THE SCREEN GOES BLACK. Not a sound. For the longest time. Then... VOICES:
53) 15) dialog: Harry! How're you feeling?
54) 6) dialog: No one blames you, Harry. The Dementors aren't meant to come on the grounds. Dumbledore was furious. After he saved you, he sent them straight off. (CONTINUED )
65) 0) text: At this elevation, the MIST hangs in thick, undulating veils, the Shrieking Shack an eerie silhouette in the gloom. Ron and Hermione stand stiffly, attempting, as best they can, to conceal the fact that, basically, they're scared stiff.
65) 1) dialog: It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
65) 3) dialog: Should we move a bit closer?
65) 8) dialog: Perfect. Just then, VOICES ECHO and THREE FIGURES appear over the rise, phantoms in the mist. Malfoy. Crabbe. Goyle. Pike.
65) 12) dialog: (a harsh chuckle) Hope you don't mean yourself. Malfoy's eyes shift, regard Hermione with disgust.
65) 19) dialog: Harry...? Harry? The Invisibility Cloak drops. Sure enough. Harry. Grinning.
66) 3) dialog: But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall, aren't you? (CONTINUED )

66) 22) dialog: 
70) 0) text: At the end of a ROCKY OUTCROP, the FOOTPRINTS end and SOBS are heard. Ron takes Hermione's arm, discouraging her from going further, but she does, filling the footprints with her own, then kneeling and -- very gently -- drawing the cloak from Harry. He stares into the mist, eyes stinging with tears.
81) 3) dialog: That's a lie!
82) 2) dialog: Harry. Will you explain to your friend Ronald that he has absolutely no proof whatsoever that my sweet, unassuming cat ate his shabby, decidedly decrepit rat. (CONTINUED)

83) 11) dialog: (dreading the answer) Where's he going, Hagrid?
88) 0) text: The students gaze into CRYSTAL BALLS, faces reflecting the mist within, so that their very skin seems to be made of smoke. Conspicuously, Harry, Ron and Hermione sit apart.

90) 0) text: Harry sets Hermione's crystal back on its stand, starts to go, when... the SMOKE within the crystal suddenly DARKENS. Leaning close, Harry watches the shape that appears. It is unmistakable: Sirius Black. Just then, a SHADOW crawls the glossy surface of the crystal and... ++. a HAND SNATCHES Harry's shoulder. He wheels, finds...

100) 9) dialog: I've got you -- Hermione pitches herself onto Harry's feet... and the three of them go scudding along.
100) 19) dialog: Haaaaaaarrrrrrilllilii! Harry squints up, sees a PILE-DRIVING FIST of a branch screaming straight down for his head. He rolls away just as -- WHOMP! -- the branch PULVERIZES the ground. Hermione WHIPS THROUGH FRAME, still clinging on for dear life, and Harry rises. FLUMPH! -- he's promptly knocked to the ground again. Hermione goes CRASHING through the high branches, Harry spies his glasses and grabs them. Rising, he fits them to his face and... HIS BLURRY POV... ... turns CRYSTAL CLEAR just in time to see Hermione FLYING MADLY TOWARD HIM.
100) 20) dialog: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

101) 3) dialog: Where do you suppose this goes?
102) 0) text: Harry and Hermione make their way through the primitive passageway, ducking the roots that dangle overhead. Then, abruptly, the tunnel... ends. Confused, Harry and Hermione glance about, then -- as one -- peer up. A small opening. Harry reaches up, hoists himself through.

105) 4) dialog: If you want to kill Harry, you'll -- you'll... have to kill us, too!
105) 7) dialog: Harry! No! Just then, FOOTSTEPS sound. Black wheels toward the door, edgy. Harry eyes Black, wand hand shaking violently. As Black turns back, he stops, regards Harry cautiously.
105) 12) dialog: Professor Lupin! Lupin ignores them, eying Black intensely.
105) 15) dialog: No! I trusted you! I covered up for you. And all this time you've been his friend! (pointing) He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes! Harry and Ron stare, dumbfounded, at Lupin. Black HOWLS then, bitterly amused. Lupin eyes him, then turns back.
105) 17) dialog: Since Professor Snape set the essay.
105) 55) dialog: Harry. You attacked a teacher. Harry looks a bit shocked himself, then turns to Black.
106) 3) dialog: Don't worry. He's under the Somnambulist Charm. It's primarily used to transport the seriously deranged. As Harry nods, Pettigrew's pleading eyes find Hermione.
106) 14) dialog: Harry... He turns, see Hermione staring at the FULL MOON. His eyes shift. Lupin is a rigid silhouette, his fingers twitching.
106) 21) dialog: Professor...? The WEREWOLF'S eyes blaze. Long teeth glitter. Then... a horrifying GROWL ERUPTS from its throat. Harry and Hermione spin, begin to flee... and run flat into Snape. As they collapse in a great clumsy pile, Snape's eyes flutter open, the spell broken. Seeing Hermione atop him, he sweeps her aside...

108) 7) dialog: Listen, Harry. They've captured Sirius. Any minute the Dementors are going to perform the Kiss.
108) 9) dialog: It's what Dementors do to those they want to destroy. They clamp their jaws over the victim's mouth and... suck out his soul.
108) 11) dialog: No. It's worse. Much worse. You go on living. But you have no memory. No sense of self. You're just a shall. An empty shell... As Harry reacts, the door opens and Dumbledore enters.
108) 12) dialog: Headmaster! You've got to stop them! They've got the wrong man!
108) 19) dialog: The point is... we know the truth. Please, sir, you must believe us.

111) 8) dialog: Hurry! Malfoy's coming! Hermione pulls Harry under the bridge. Seconds later, FOOTSTEPS CLAMOR over their heads.

112) 3) dialog: What?
112) 6) dialog: No! Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free! Harry nods, then looks toward the hut. Inside, Hagrid is handing Scabbers to Ron.
112) 8) dialog: No, Harry! You can't!
112) 10) dialog: Yes! You Must! (pointing inside) Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut right now. If you go bursting inside, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things can happen when wizards meddle with time. We can't be seen. Hermione turns, watches Fudge and the others drawing closer. She frowns, glances into the hut. (CONTINUED )
112) 13) dialog: Fudge is coming and... we're not leaving... why aren't we leaving? Just then... on the ground beside her... Hermione notices a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE.

Quickly, Hermione and Harry dash into the trees directly behind... just in time to see themselves -- along with Ron -- exit the back door and slip behind the pumpkin pile where, only seconds before, they were hiding. As Fudge appears at the window and picks his nose as before, Hermione ponders the back of her own head.
112) 18) dialog: Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
112) 20) dialog: Nothing, I just thought I saw... Never mind. (CONTINUED )

115) 5) dialog: Now we wait.
