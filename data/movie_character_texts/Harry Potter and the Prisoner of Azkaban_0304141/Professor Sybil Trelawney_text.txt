A crimson scrim FLUTTERS and SYBIL TRELAWNEY, Divination Professor, glides dramatically INTO VIEW, eyes huge and bug-like behind enormous glasses.
38) 4) dialog: ... the Sight. Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. Together, we shall cast ourselves into the future. But know this. One either has the Gift or not. It cannot be divined from the pages of a book. Books only cloud one's Inner Eye.
38) 8) dialog: (spinning on Neville) You, boy! Is your grandmother well?
38) 10) dialog: I wouldn't be so sure of that. (continuing) The first term will be devoted to the reading of tea leaves. If all goes well, we will proceed to palmistry, fire omens, and finally... the crystal ball. (eyeing Parvati) By the way, dear, beware a red- haired man. (CONTINUED )
38) 13) dialog: Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And in late spring, one of our number will... leave us forever. As the class exchanges uneasy glances, Trelawney smiles brightly.
38) 14) dialog: Well then. Shall we? cut TO:
38) 16) dialog: Broaden your minds, my dears. And allow your eyes to see... beyond. Trelawney takes Lavender Brown's cup, peers inside.
38) 17) dialog: A five-leaf clover... You can expect to wake with a horrible rash tomorrow morning, dear. (then, casually) Mr. Longbottom, after you've broken your first cup... CA-CHINK! Neville fumbles the cup in his hands and the brittle CRASH of CHINA is heard.

88) 3) dialog: (eyes narrowing) My dear, from the moment you first arrived in my class, I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination. You may be young in years, but the heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.
