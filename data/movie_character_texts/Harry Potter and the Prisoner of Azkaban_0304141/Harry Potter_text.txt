Harry drops the trunk. Sits. Deep in the night, an ALARM SHRIEKS, goes SILENT. Harry, still as a statue. Listening. In the trees above, LEAVES TREMBLE. The WIND gathers. Harry turns, studies the swaying swings, the carousel. Then, he... stiffens. Turns back. Sensing something in the shadows across the street, he rises. Slowly draws his wand. Then he sees... it. Something BIG. Darker than the shadows which conceal it. Something with WIDE, GLEAMING EYES. Harry steps back. Afraid to look. Afraid not to. Wand outstretched... he TRIPS, tumbles over the forgotten trunk. The tip of his wand BLAZES. BANG! TWIN BEAMS of BLINDING LIGHT spear the night.

DOORS HISS. Snap back. REVEAL STAN SHUNPIKE, an 18- year-old boy in a WRINKLED CONDUCTOR'S UNIFORM. Pasty face. Raccoon eyes. Stan looks like he hasn't seen the sun in years.

Harry gives chase, then the book turns, begins NIPPING viciously at his shoes. Harry vaults atop the bed, watches the book disappear underneath, then grabs a PILLOW. Seconds later, the book scuttles into view and Harry POUNCES -- FLUMPH! The BOOK ROARS angrily, muffled beneath the pillow. Harry takes the ROPE, prepares to rebind it.

45) 3) dialog: Yes, Professor, but I thought if you said I could go -- PROFESSOR McGONAGALL But I don't say so. A parent or guardian must sign, and since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. (a flicker of pity) I'm sorry, Potter. But that's my final word. Ron and Hermione -- watching Harry expectantly from across the way -- see him turn, shake his head. Their faces fall. Harry raises his hand in farewell. Watches them go.

107) 5) dialog: No... No! (drawing his wand) Expecto... Patronum! A thin silvery wisp weeps from Harry's wand, hovering like a VEIL, but the Dementors continue to come. Harry places his hand on Black's HEAVING HEART, poises his wand once more:
107) 6) dialog: Expecto... Patronum... Harry's Patronus blooms briefly... and dies. Harry's eyes flutter, the DEMENTORS twisting madly in his vision, drawing closer. Black GASPS. SILVERY FEATHERS of LIGHT tumble from his lips, as if his very soul were leaving him... Then... a LIGHT splinters the trees. Harry squints, sees a FIERY STAG appear... its body luminous... slashing through the trees... sowing light in the darkness. The Dementors wilt in its wake, but more replace them, sweeping down in waves. Still, the stag charges on. The LIGHT EXPANDS. The forest blazing with it. The remaining Dementors flee, drifting across the moon like ash. The light ebbs. The stag's luminous body flickers. There is a BRIGHT FLASH and darkness returns, a single THREAD of LIGHT all that remains, spinning down to the size of a PEARL... in the palm of MAN, standing deep in the trees. Harry studies the strangely familiar SILHOUETTE, then... it is gone. Silence drops like a curtain. MIST rises from the lake. As Snape appears at the top of the rise, we -- FADE TO BLACK.

110) 0) text: Harry and Hermione come to a mad, huffing halt.
110) 1) dialog: Hermione! Will you please tell me what it is we're doing?! She holds up a hand, silencing him. Annoyed, Harry follows her gaze and BLINKS in DISBELIEF. Across the grounds...

112) 9) dialog: Hermione, that's the man who betrayed my parents! You don't expect me to just sit here...
112) 14) dialog: Are you mad? Hermione ignores him, swiftly whistling a second stone through the window and -- CONK! -- off the back of Harry's head.
112) 15) dialog: That hurt.
112) 19) dialog: Shhh! Hermione sees herself turn. Ducking, she accidentally stirs the branches, then peeks out and sees herself staring curiously at the branches DANCING ODDLY. Next she hears her own voice:
112) 25) dialog: Get away! Harry waves the crow away, yanks hard on Buckbeat's chain.
112) 27) dialog: C'mon, Buckbeak. Come on... Buckbeak refuses to move.
113) 1) dialog: Now what?
113) 3) dialog: And we do that... how?

115) 4) dialog: And now we wait.
116) 3) dialog: Hermione...
116) 7) dialog: Before. Down by the lake. When I was with Sirius... I did see someone... that someone made the Dementors go away...

117) 6) dialog: When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursley's. I'm going to tell him I'd like to live someplace in the country. I think he'd like that, after all those years in Azkaban. We don't need a big place and I can help him... A HOWL pierces the night. Hermione glances toward the Willow.
117) 8) dialog: Which means Pettigrew is slipping safely into the night. While we just stand here... A FIERCE GROWLING is heard as twin silhouettes -- the DOG and the WEREWOLF -- bound into the tall grass. Harry watches himself appear, hurl the stick as before. The werewolf turns, begins to stalk... OWWWWWWWWW! Harry wheels, sees Hermione, hands cupped to her mouth, making a loud HOWL. He covers her mouth.
117) 9) dialog: What are you doing?
117) 11) dialog: Thanks. But we have to move.

121) 1) dialog: You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was... me. I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time, because... because I'd already done it. Does that make sense? Hermione contemplates this.

137) 9) dialog: The fastest broom in the world. As everyone turns -- WHOOSH! -- Harry JETS OFF and we --
138) 0) text: A tiny DOT, GROWING LARGER AND LARGER, races upward. It's Harry shooting straight into the blue on the Firebolt. A SCREAM GROWS LOUDER as he approaches. A scream of release, of utter abandon. It's Harry screaming. But something else is clear as he JETS PAST and... The SCREEN GOES BLACK. It's a SCREAM of joy. FADE OUT.
