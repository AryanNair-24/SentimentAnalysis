KAREN CLARK from the State Department is surrounded by ten or so aides and functionaries, security people and assistants. (Including Chad and LIZA one of Karen's senior aides.) Then there is Bob Adriano's gang of advisors, smaller but sitting separately. Next to them is a Pentagon delegation, including uniformed members of all three services. Lots of hubbub.

No time to wash it off. Grabs a towel and picks up the phone holding the towel. He struggles to press the answer button. Puts the towel- covered phone to his ear.

Then with a flash as he looks at the clock - 9.07 he remembers a lot of things in a rush and springs out like a Ninja and starts pulling his clothes on, while scrabbling for his phone. He heads down stairs &amp; out of the apartment.

50) 25) dialog: What is going on here? Fuck. Why's this my problem? Toby you sure you didn't do bad? You didn't mention the committee to anyone else?
50) 27) text: I have no idea what I'm saying anymore I think I really am still quite drunk. Chad is passing. As Liza turns away Toby's face does a spasm of regret at his brazen lying.
50) 29) dialog: I don't feel that.
50) 33) dialog: Sure. Toby goes back to Simon 
50) 35) dialog: So, how far would you go with Linton, you freaky little stalker? Downtown? Or all the way up Brokeback Mountain?
