3) 32) text: Back with Malcolm, Toby close by. Malc's on the phone.
3) 33) dialog: No. You're fine to go ahead and print that. It's lies, you'd be lying, but go ahead. He did not say unforeseeable. No he did not. Oh, just before you go -- when I tell your wife about you and Angela Heaney at the Blackpool conference...would email be better? Or a phone call? Or, hey I know, I'll write it on a cake, "Your hack husband betrayed you on the 4th of October, and congratulations on the new baby" in those little silver balls. (BEAT) Yeah, maybe best to spike it?

6) 4) dialog: Yeah. Very good.
6) 6) dialog: That is not our line, alright? Walk the fucking line. Look.
6) 12) dialog: Not the time love. Fuck off.
6) 13) text: JUDY smiles at MALCOLM, and doesn't fuck off.
6) 15) dialog: Don't apologise for me. You should apologise for yourself. (to Judy) Did I not just tell you to fuck off and yet you're still here?
6) 17) dialog: (to Toby) Hey, foetus boy. Lesson One: If I tell you to fuck off what do you do?
6) 19) dialog: You'll go far.Now fuck off.
6) 23) dialog: No, You're not going on Question Time tonight. You've been disinvited. 
6) 26) dialog: Because they ask fucking questions on Question Time. And you're no good at questions. If it was Fumbling, Off- Message Shit Fucking Answer Time, you'd be our main guy. But it's not.
6) 28) dialog: Why should I tell you about this?
6) 30) dialog: Your purview? Where do you think you are sweetheart, in some Regency costume drama? This is a government department, not a fucking Jane Austen novel. Allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet on your purview and ram it up the shitter with a lubricated horse cock.
6) 32) dialog: (to Simon, lads' chat)
6) 36) dialog: No, not until we can trust you to keep to the line.
6) 39) dialog: What is it then? A beat.

22) 13) dialog: (different tack needed) (at Toby and Judy) Right, you two, The White Stripes, outside.
22) 15) dialog: There's only two people in the White Stripes.
22) 17) dialog: 
22) 20) dialog: Washington. The boss wants you over there on a fact-finder. Problems we might face if it all goes boombastic in the Middle East.

43) 10) dialog: What? The actual....war committee?
43) 12) dialog: Who's going to be there?
43) 14) dialog: Who else is going -- Jimmy Osmond? Gwyneth Paltrow? You've been invited to a diversion. The real committee, the real thing, that's happening at The White House.
43) 17) dialog: Don't mention this to the press, ok? Don't mention it to anyone. Because if the press get a whiff there's a war committee, even a cardboard one, every fucker in this town is going to turn up and try and get on it. So no matter what gay bar you end up, keep it schtumm.

46) 1) dialog: We are under enormous pressure Simon. Karen will want you to say, `war is unforeseeable'. Linton will want you to talk up `climbing the mountain of conflict'. You say nothing, okay? You can't swing both ways, you're not David fucking Bowie.

51) 12) dialog: Don't get sarcastic with me son. (starts dialling) We burnt this tight-arsed city to the ground in 1814 and I'm all for doing it again. Starting with you, you frat fuck. You get sarcastic with me again and I will stuff so much cotton wool dowm your fucking throat it'll come out of your arse like the wee tail on a playboy bunny. Okay? I thought...I was led to believe I was attending the war committee.
51) 14) dialog: I don't want the bullshit son, I want the bull. No one sidelines me. I'm away.
51) 15) text: Malcolm gets up, grabs his coat. An even younger guy wheels in a coffee trolley.

62) 1) dialog: Are you fucking me about? 
62) 4) dialog: You might pull this kind of stunt on some young wank fresh up from Oklahoma, happy to be getting his hookers paid for by tobacco lobbyists, but not me.
62) 6) dialog: I've just had a briefing from a 9-year- old finalist in Americas got talent. I think he may have been a ventriloquist. Or possibly the fucking dummie.
62) 8) dialog: His fucking briefing notes were written in Alphabetti Spaghetti. When I left I nearly tripped over his umbilical cord.
62) 10) text: Simon is emerging. Linton takes Malcolm to one side, out of Simon's earshot.
62) 12) dialog: Yeah, apparently your fucking master race of gifted toddlers can't quit get the job done in between breast feeds and playing with their power rangers. So yeah, we're getting some actual grown-ups to bail you out.
62) 18) dialog: What the fuck does that mean? `All roads lead to Munich'?
62) 20) dialog: `All roads lead to Munich'? Malcolm is pissed off, looks around. He is not the centre of attention. He's feeling cut out.
62) 21) dialog: Come on let's go, get back to the hotel, nick as many coat hangers as you can. We're off back to London.
63) 0) text: Malcolm, Toby, and Simon are heading towards their car. They see the Washington Monument in the distance.

75) 6) dialog: You are being portrayed as the biggest twat in Northamptonshire, and that's going some.
75) 8) dialog: Listen, my little stem cell, I don't want to be dealing with this either, okay? I've got bigger fucking fish to fry, believe me. I'm rolling blue whales in breadcrumbs at the moment. I'm giving this to Jamie.
75) 19) dialog: Right, I'm off to deal with the fate of the planet, okay?
75) 22) dialog: Don't look at me like that's arrogant. That is just a fucking fact. Don't even look at me. (to Jamie)

77) 8) dialog: Now then, you still got doubts, Complicated Simon?
77) 10) dialog: That's why you've got to stay in Government. In here you can influence things, delay things. Out there you're just another mad shouty fucker people don't want to make eye-contact with. Remember Mary? She took a stand over Health. Everyone decided she was mental.
77) 12) dialog: I found that a very powerful image. (a beat) Look, the Prime Minister of this country is not a Viking. He doesn't drink blood, he doesn't go round biting tramps. He doesn't go to Chequers at the weekend for a bit of light raping and a pub lunch.
77) 14) dialog: Unlike me, the man abhors physical violence.
77) 19) dialog: Listen, We've got evidence harder than a diamond dildo. We have intelligence so deep and hard it would fucking puncture your kidneys.There's an informant, `Ice Man', OK? The stuff he's giving us? It'll make your blood run cold. And clot. Your insides will turn to black pudding. (lowering his voice)
77) 22) text: Prime Minister wants to speak to you in ten minutes, Simon. He want you to go the UN. Malcolm's heading out.
77) 23) dialog: See- you're A-list now. You're a Kennedy. In the VIP lounge, with the gold card and the complimentary drinks and the hard-on. Malcolm leaves. A beat.
77) 25) text: Show me the evidence, Malcolm, that's my fucking bottom line.
83) 0) text: Simon and Toby looking very uptight. Malcolm's with them.
83) 1) dialog: (looking at phone) So. The wires are all currently reporting that you're going to resign from government over the war.
83) 3) dialog: Yeah well it is outside. It's lurking outside like a big hairy rapist at a coach station.
83) 5) dialog: Do you know, if I could I'd punch you into total paralysis. 
84) 0) text: 97 Malcolm, Simon, Toby and Judy are being led through a bleak, soulless basement corridor in the UN by Sir Jonathan Tutt, the British ambassador to the UN.

84) 9) dialog: Nibbles? Who still says nibbles?

84) 14) dialog: No fucking signal down here. Jesus. I'd be better off in an internet cafe in Kircoddy.
86) 0) text: Malcolm finishing listening to his voicemail, dialling and running back into the building, pushing past a crowd of smokers at the doorway.
86) 1) dialog: Okay Jamie, two jobs. One: find the Pwip Pip leaker and kill them. That's one job. Job one has two parts. Job two: stop Pwip Pip coming out. Sow enough seeds of fear and doubt that the fat arses at the BBC dither till after the vote, okay? After the vote Enola Gay is cleared for take- off and everything is groovy.   I love you.
87) 0) text: Lots of delegates drinking and eating and chatting. We glimpse Linton, Karen, General Miller. Sir Jonathan is there, mingling. Malcolm approaches Simon, Toby, Judy and Sir Jonathan.

87) 5) dialog: (to Simon) Was it you?
87) 7) dialog: But you know what I'm talking about?
87) 9) dialog: (to Toby) Was it you, The-Baby-From-Eraserhead?
87) 11) dialog: (to Judy) So it must have been you Woman from The Crying Game?
87) 13) dialog: Someone's dropped a bollock in the noodles and I reckon it was you.
87) 15) dialog: Yeah well I know you didn't leak last time. But what I reckon is you got so pissy about being accused, you leaked this time.
87) 20) dialog: Come on, Baldermort, I need a word. Meanwhile Judy and Toby are left alone - Toby embarrassed about his comments.
87) 25) dialog: We're in a new reality now and You've got to speed things up.
87) 27) dialog: The debate. It needs to start at eleven o'clock, not one thirty.
87) 29) dialog: Just fucking do it, fishlips. Otherwise you'll find yourself in some medieval warzone in the Caucasus with your arse in the air, trying to persuade a group of men in balaclavas that sustained sexual violence is not the way forward. 
87) 32) dialog: Then I'll do it. (motioning to a door)
87) 35) dialog: Then you do it. Get in there. He is almost man-handling him in.
87) 37) dialog: I'm leading, look follow my lead.
87) 39) dialog: Where's the intel? Are you sure you're working as hard as me? Cos I'm sweating spinal fluid here. I'm a husk.
87) 41) dialog: (in a hurry)
87) 46) dialog: I'm doing my own work. I'm doing my job.
87) 48) dialog: Oooo. Tough talk from the armchair General. What you going to do? Throw a cushion at me? Put your feet up on a poof and go back to sleep why don't you?
87) 50) dialog: Have you ever even killed anybody? Really?
87) 52) dialog: Falling asleep on someone doesn't count.
87) 55) dialog: Personally, I prefer maiming.
87) 57) dialog: Go ahead. I can see the headlines now. 'Peace-Loving General Starts Fight In UN, Swiss Intervene'. I don't know, I'm no expert on spin but could that hurt your career? 
87) 59) dialog: Right. Do excuse me. I've got work to do. Oh, and don't EVER call me fucking English again.
93) 0) text: Malcolm and Linton enter. We see Simon's mints lying on the big stone in the middle of the room.
93) 2) dialog: Honestly? I haven't got it. We need more time.
93) 4) dialog: No. I've had the vote brought forward. Simon comes in to retrieve his mints.
93) 8) dialog: Okay, quick reality check, J Edgar Fucking Hoover. I don't work for you. You don't tell me what to fucking do.
93) 10) text: Malcolm glances at Simon.
93) 11) dialog: Get your Polos and fuck off.
93) 15) dialog: (quietly, to Toby) What do you want?
93) 22) dialog: It's complicated, okay? I've been juggling a number of responsibilities. Simon stares at Malcolm. He takes a mint and pops it in his mouth.
93) 24) dialog: Look. It's too late now. Resigning. It's not worth it. The horse has bolted. It's out there getting shot now.
93) 26) dialog: (to Toby)
93) 27) text: If you repeat this to anyone I will pull your leg off, break it in two and stab you to death with your broken shin bone. Now go away. Toby leaves. Malcolm sits down, head in his hands.
96) 0) text: On the closed door of the Meditation Room. Malcolm suddenly bursts out, re-energised, ready for action. He's in the middle of a call. 
96) 2) dialog: Yeah, BBC newsdesk please. Malcolm Tucker. (BEAT) Ben? Hi, how you doing? Yeah, well, I'm hearing you're preparing a story that we might not like.
96) 3) text: One of the doors he pushes open has a coffee machine in it. Toby is there getting a coffee. Malcolm gestures to him to come along. Toby joins Malc in his jog through the corridors, spilling his coffee on his hands as he goes and scalding himself.
96) 4) dialog: I just want to say please, this garden wall story, please don't run with it. (beat, winks at Toby - you getting this?) Simon Foster's constituency-office wall? You've got that haven't you? I haven't let the cat out of the bag? Shit. Look, my reputation will be in tatters if you run with... (to Toby) And he's gone. Boo hoo. I've got a hard on.
96) 7) dialog: I know it was you who leaked Linton's War Committee.
96) 9) dialog: Are you telling me it wasn't you? Is that your proposition? Is that want you want to say if I ask them to fly you to Diego Garcia and slip a hood over your head and carry out a cavity search?
96) 11) dialog: That's more like it. So...you are now on probation. Okay?
96) 16) dialog: You're my guy now. I own you now. You're my Kunte Kinte. Go and get your laptop.
96) 17) text: Toby goes. Malcolm pushes open another door. Sir Jonathan Tutt is in there.
96) 18) dialog: Ah, ambassador -- with your big baldy head you are spoiling us.
96) 20) dialog: Great. I need it delayed now.
96) 22) dialog: By an hour, at least. Although I guess two and a half hours now, as you've brought it forward.
96) 24) dialog: You do what I say or you can go and see if Belize are looking for a new ambassador but with a broken nose, one bollock, and a half-chewed cock.
99) 0) text: Toby is standing in front of Malcolm, holding his laptop up for Malcolm to look at and a physical copy of the red Pwip-Pip folder. He's also got the Pwip-Pip file on screen.

99) 3) dialog: Okay, go to page nine, highlight that.
99) 6) dialog: Highlight from that page to the end of the document.
99) 8) dialog: I don't know I don't use these things.
99) 14) dialog: Is it highlighted?
99) 16) dialog: Okay, right, standby ... delete!
99) 20) dialog: (to Toby) Messenger! Get Messenger up!
99) 23) text: Malcolm types something on the laptop while Toby holds it up for him.
99) 24) dialog: Have you tried hitting him? Give him a thump, that usually works.
99) 28) dialog: Great. Now attach that to email. 
99) 32) dialog: (to Toby)
100) 0) text: Malcolm approaches Toby.
100) 1) dialog: Get me a blue folder.
100) 3) dialog: I don't fucking know. Do I look like I've ever set foot in a stationary cupboard? I do my shagging in five star hotels. Now go and find me a blue fucking folder. Pronto. Toby runs off.
101) 0) text: Malcolm walks in. He holds up his blue folder.
101) 1) dialog: The intelligence your guys couldn't find? I think you owe me a massive, grovelling apology.
101) 3) dialog: It's been   a pleasure working with you. You know,   I've met some psychos in my time, but   none as fucking BORING as you. Oh sorry,   that's right. You disapprove of swearing.   A boring F star star CUNT! Malc hands over the folder and walks out. 
102) 9) text: Resolution 5977 is passed. Judy looks at Malcolm. Malcolm looks straight ahead at the screen, nods, impassive.
106) 3) dialog: Simon, look, mate. Listen to me. You still don't need to resign.
106) 10) dialog: It's nor Ridiculous. You're fired.
106) 12) dialog: The wall. It's just not tolerable.
106) 14) dialog: Look at this. (clicks his fingers at Toby) Give me the paper. (off Simon's look) He's my new boy. I'm just breaking him in.
106) 17) dialog: The Telegraph has a cartoon of you crushed underneath the Great Wall Of China, suggesting you are the only political fuck-up visible from space. Look at this. No one could survive this. The PM is very clear on this - you're sacked, over the wall.
106) 19) dialog: Yes.
106) 21) dialog: Yes I have.
106) 23) dialog: I have spoken to the Prime Minister. Whether it has happened or not is irrelevant. It is true. As soon as I heard about the wall, I spoke to him and he decided you had to go.
106) 25) dialog: Yeah well if you try to turn this into some anti-war protest, you can expect your `mountain of conflict' soundbite to be everywhere from ringtones to a fucking dance mix on YouTube. I will marshall all the forces of media darkness to hound you to an assisted suicide. A silence while Simon and Toby realise there is nowhere for him to go.
106) 26) dialog: Right, Rumpleforeskin's give me your laptop, so -- shall we draft your `Dear Prime Minister, just a quick note to say thanks for sacking me' letter? Simon doesn't know what else to do. Toby goes to get his laptop. Miller is having a cigarette under a no-smoking sign. 
108) 0) text: Malcolm is walking through the open-plan office with Judy. In the background we see Toby getting the last of his things together. The NEW MINISTER and her ADVISOR arrive. They are almost carbon copies of Simon and Toby.

108) 3) dialog: Ah, cheeky! Let me take you out for an expensive lunch, roast swan and all the trimmings, and I'll bring you up to speed on the whole Middle East situation.
108) 5) dialog: Aye, but in a friendly, non-breaky way. Watch your step there. There's still blood on the deck.
108) 10) text: She points at Toby's desk. The Minister and his advisor start making themselves at home. We stay on Toby now as Malcolm and Judy greet the new guys.
