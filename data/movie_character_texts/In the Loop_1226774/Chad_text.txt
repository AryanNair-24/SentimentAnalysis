10) 4) dialog: Ah, Michael? I'm Chad.
10) 6) dialog: We'd like a dual horse-shoe formation for the meeting set-up - an enclave for Ms Clark, an enclave for the Pentagon delegation. First names acceptable to all parties and politely we request the presence of both carbonated and non- carbonated waters.
10) 8) dialog: Thanks so much.
11) 0) text: Chad's dual horse-shoe is packed with people. The room's pretty much full. KAREN CLARK from the State Department is surrounded by ten or so aides and functionaries, security people and assistants. (Including Chad and LIZA one of Karen's senior aides.) Then there is Bob Adriano's gang of advisors, smaller but sitting separately. Next to them is a Pentagon delegation, including uniformed members of all three services. Lots of hubbub. SUZY leads SIMON, TOBY and JUDY in, and shows them to their seats. 
13) 3) text: Chad arrives. Karen talks to someone else.
13) 4) dialog: Hey Liza. Your paper got a major citation. You must be psyched Karen brought it up.
13) 6) dialog: You could not write anything that clashes more violently with the current climate than you the one you wrote if you were trying, and it almost seems like you were trying.
13) 8) dialog: You are like the woman from The Omen, you've given birth to a demon and it's going to kill you.
13) 12) dialog: Ooh.
13) 14) dialog: You bring this up whenever you run out of arguments. I don't see how my parents' limited reproductive abilities reflects badly on me. I'm the sperm that made it.
13) 16) dialog: Have fun with your career kryptonite.
23) 0) text: Liza, Karen and Chad arrive in the buzzing State Department offices, knackered but in action mode.

26) 27) dialog: (aside, to Liza)
26) 28) text: Go, Buffy - you belong to the vampire queen now. Liza follows Karen out. Chad takes Liza's seat.
26) 30) dialog: (what?)
50) 27) text: I have no idea what I'm saying anymore I think I really am still quite drunk. Chad is passing. As Liza turns away Toby's face does a spasm of regret at his brazen lying.
50) 28) dialog: Everyone is so hot for your paper. I'm running off another ten copies. It's spreading like a virus, Liza. You're in hot water. You're lobsterising.
50) 30) dialog: It's by degrees. Wafting. Bisque. I smell lobster. Can you smell lobster, Toby? Simon calls Toby back over.
53) 13) text: Karen goes into the toilet. Simon and Toby head off looking sheepish. As they head out of the vestibule. There is a gaggle of Karen hangers-on. Chad-type staffers looking to get in with Karen.
61) 0) text: 74 It's lunchtime. Lots of staffers have left their desks. A few are eating sandwiches at their desks, or reading a newspaper during lunch. Chad is emailing, reading, multi- tasking, from a corner of desk near Linton's office.
61) 2) dialog: Are you kidding? Lunchtime is work time.
61) 6) dialog: Yeah work hours are too valuable - for networking. You gotta get in at like 6 work till 8.30 Then start making those connections baby. (he clicks his fingers rapidly, annoyingly)
74) 0) text: Karen runs out of the lifts. There's even more of a buzz than usual, people running around. She sees Bob Adriano, Linton and Chad in a huddle in Linton's air. Hurries over to Liza.
105) 0) text: 119 Karen enters. Chad is there too with General Miller.
105) 19) dialog: Er, I might, stay with the General actually Karen, if that's okay? If he's staying I might stay with him and see what assistance I can furnish.
105) 23) dialog: You've got balls Sir. Anyone can see you've got big balls. They're two-thirds of a snowman.
105) 26) dialog: Okay. This was not the plan.
