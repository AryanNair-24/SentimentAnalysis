3) 2) dialog: No.
3) 4) dialog: No. I didn't take the washing out of the machine.
3) 6) dialog: It'll be fine.
3) 8) dialog: It is fine. I'll wear stale pants.
3) 10) dialog: Well, there we go. I could go commando, but I don't think that's acceptable in government.
3) 13) dialog: Oh Yes. It's all here. My massive intellect. And an apple for Simon Foster.
3) 15) dialog: Don't say that, I'm rebranding him.
3) 17) dialog: Well I'm going to sort that out. After a week I'll have him sounding like a chicken without a wasp up its arse.
3) 19) dialog: Have a good day at the Foreign Office. Try not to annoy Russia.
3) 21) dialog: Yeah, alright.
3) 26) dialog: Are you going to keep ringing me up every two minutes, because you're starting to remind me of my mum. And that could lead to all sorts of erectile dysfunction.

3) 38) dialog: To keep it fresh.
3) 41) dialog: No, but it still might dry out.
3) 47) dialog: No it isn't. That's a myth. Clingfilm is perfectly safe. Malcolm now eyeing Toby with suspicion/contempt -- who is this dick? Toby tries to smile, lowers his voice, embarrassed.
3) 50) dialog: They wouldn't sell clingfilm if it gave you cancer. Clingfilm doesn't give you cancer. And Lasagne doesn't give you syphillis.

8) 2) dialog: Hiya. You do know this is the third time you've rung? Are you on a new tariff?
8) 4) dialog: All a bit manic. It was never like this at Agriculture. People tend not to swear so much about wheat. Apart from farmers. They swear about everything.
8) 6) text: Can you turn that down a bit? (to Toby)
8) 8) dialog: Right - Karen Clark from...is that the woman who went round Britain in a coracle for leukemia?

25) 6) dialog: Oh. Okay ...

37) 26) dialog: I don't know, I thought tonight we'd be tired?
37) 28) text: Well I am tired but I'm also a career politician Toby, in the political powerhouse of the world for forty-eight hours. So I thought it might be nice to, you know, go out rather than sit in my room trying to spank one out watching a shark documentary, because I'm scared if I watch a porno it'll end up in the Register of Members Interests. So what have you got?
37) 29) dialog: Okay ... What have I got?

78) 28) dialog: Could we not talk about accusations and, health issues, in the pub?
78) 33) dialog: I don't know, it was a weird, intense time over there. It was...maybe, subconsciously, I don't know, it was a kind of last ditch attempt to stop this, awful...war.

81) 0) text: Simon, Toby and Judy are on the way to Heathrow.
81) 5) dialog: Though -- maybe? What's brave about doing the `right thing'? Nothing. Doing the wrong thing is braver. In a way. I mean, you know, wars sometimes work. The War of Independence, that worked. For the Americans. Second World War. That was a good idea. I mean not a good idea but ...

87) 16) dialog: Yeah. Yeah, that does sound possible.
87) 19) dialog: I'm just saying psychologically speaking that sounds plausible - that you might build up a resentment and then pay it off in some underhand way. That's just something I've observed. Malcolm's had enough goes over and grabs Sir Jonathan, mid-conversation, and manhandles him away.
87) 21) dialog: (they look at each other)
