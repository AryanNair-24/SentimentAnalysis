75) 10) text: Jamie enters, holding another local rag.
75) 11) dialog: Well, if it isn't Humpty-Numpty...
75) 13) dialog: With respect, I haven't finished. If it isn't Humpty-Numpty, sitting on top of a collapsing wall like some clueless egg- cunt.
75) 16) dialog: Okay, that's enough of the fucking Oxbridge pleasantries.
75) 18) dialog: (grabbing a hole-puncher) Shut it, Love, Actually, or I'll hole- punch your face.
75) 20) text: Simon, Toby and Jamie look at him. 
75) 24) dialog: You know me, Malcy, kid gloves.   Made from real kids. Malcolm leaves. An awkward beat.
75) 25) dialog: Right, Butch and Gaydance, this wall story is playing badly. (looking in his paper)
75) 29) dialog: They're builders. What did you expect?! Have you ever seen a film where the hero is a builder? No. Because they never turn up in the fucking nick of time.That's why you never see a superhero with a hod.
85) 0) text: Jamie is on the phone, running down a corridor.
85) 1) dialog: Okay, your phone's off, which means you've been shot dead by a fat American, but there's been a fucktastrophe. Someone's leaked Liza Weld's Pwip Pip paper to the BBC. I reckon it'll be on the Six O'Clock news here, one o'clock your time, so it's going to fist your fucking vote apart. Missing you loads, pwip-pip, toodle-oo!
92) 0) text: Michael and Suzy are sitting talking in an FO office. Jamie bursts in.
92) 1) dialog: Was it you?
92) 3) dialog: Not you. I know it wasn't you, you're too fucking horny for your Knighthood.
92) 6) dialog: Was it fucking you!? Answer the question!
92) 8) dialog: Fuck off to your room, Count of Cunty Cristo, this is between me and her. (to Suzy) You leaked Liza Weld's paper to the BBC. Tell me you leaked it.
92) 10) dialog: You're lying. You touched your nose. That's what's called a `tell'. You are lying. 
92) 13) dialog: `No I'm not.' That's a tell as well. Classic. (changing tack to terror) I know the leak came from here, from this fucking fax machine here.
92) 15) dialog: This is what I'm doing to the machine. (he kicks it, hard till bits start to break off, but he's still quite controlled talking, as he kicks more) You see? This is how angry I am with the piece of office equipment which leaked this document, so can you imagine how angry I am with the person who did it? Yeah? Can you Suzy?
92) 18) dialog: Oh fuck off. Don't come over all Spartacus now.
92) 20) dialog: What?
92) 21) text: Advances on Michael, becomes aware of the music. Jamie points to the CD player.
92) 22) dialog: Okay for a start turn that fucking row off. It's just fucking vowels. Listen to it. Just subsidised fucking foreign vowels. You only listen to that shit because it's bad form to actually wear a big hat that says "I went to private school".
92) 23) text: Michael doesn't turn it off, so Jamie does.
92) 24) dialog: Who did you leak it to? 
92) 27) dialog: (considers then, )
92) 28) text: Ok. See this fax machine?(kick) That's your career. I'm pretty sure it's fucked. Let me just check (kick). Yeah, it is. Plus, breach of Official Secrets, so that's fucking swannee. Maybe you can get a part time job in West End as a gentleman's fluffer. Or whatever the fuck they call it these days. Jamie is heading off.
92) 30) dialog: No, no. I will not allow this to be a bang. This will be a whimper, a tiny pathetic whimper like a puppy being fucked by a big metal puppy-fucking machine. And they do exist, `cos my gran's got one. Jamie leaves.
94) 2) text: Suzy, how's it going? Has Jamie been round? Right... Liza comes over.
95) 0) text: 108 Michael and Suzy in Michael's office, classical music in the background. Michael's clearing his desk, putting stuff in boxes. Jamie bursts in on Michael and Suzy, his phone still on.
95) 1) dialog: Right, Frank and Nancy Sinatra. I've got good news. You're not fired. That's great news, isn't it?
95) 3) dialog: He's fucking delighted. (cancels phone) We want to put Liza Weld's Pwip Pip out there, properly. In the public domain. We just have to refine it a bit.
95) 5) dialog: Take out the cons, change the name of the main informant.
95) 9) dialog: Changing his name doesn't make a difference. The main source in there he's not really called Ice Man, is he? "Mr and Mrs Man, you've got a son, Ice." So we change it, to another name. Who's the fuck with the fiddle? The Fiddlefuck.
95) 11) dialog: Okay, we'll call him Debussy.
95) 13) dialog: And then you'll make a couple of other changes. It'll mean your fingerprints are on it, Mikey, but it's the only way to save your job, you leaky fuck.
95) 16) dialog: What? Oh, that thing about your fax? Don't worry about that. I made that up. The paper was sent by e-mail. It;s just, the fax machine was there and it;s easier to kick.
95) 18) dialog: (grabbing Michael) Come on Deuce Bigalow. You're coming with me.
98) 0) text: Jamie has taken Michael into a tiny windowless office. Michael's hunched at his laptop, looking at the Pwip-Pip document on his computer. Jamie stands right over him, ominously.
98) 1) dialog: (to Michael re: the office)
99) 2) dialog: Yeah it's all fine.
99) 4) dialog: (to Michael)
99) 7) dialog: Do you mean select?
99) 9) dialog: (to Michael)
99) 15) dialog: You mean selected, yeah it's selected.
99) 17) dialog: (to Michael) Delete!
99) 22) dialog: Oh hang on Malc. Michael's stopped moving. I think he's crashed.
99) 25) dialog: Hang on, I think I might be able to use manual over-ride.
99) 26) text: Jamie picks up Michael's hand and pulls out his index finger and places it on the delete key.
99) 27) dialog: No, it's okay. It's working again.
99) 30) dialog: (to Michael)
104) 0) text: A TV shows BBC News 24's report on the vote. Jamie is stroking Michael's hair in a sweet and therefore very very scary way. Michael's staring ahead pretending it isn't happening.
104) 1) dialog: (sweetly) Well done Michael. You did a good job. You did a really, really good job.
