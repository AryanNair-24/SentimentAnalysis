23) 2) text: What's Linton been up to while we've been away....have we declared war on California yet? But before the staffer can answer they run right into Linton. Karen stands her ground.
23) 3) dialog: Ah. Karen.
23) 5) dialog: How was London? Good hotel?
23) 9) dialog: Good meetings?
23) 11) text: Karen realises that Linton is reading a message on his cell phone and not listening.
23) 12) dialog: Good. Welcome back. I'll read your words when they come through. Thank you so much
23) 13) text: Linton heads off to his office. A beat later so does Karen. Chad goes off a little towards Linton's office.
23) 17) dialog: Brad.
23) 19) dialog: Uh-huh. Exactly
23) 21) text: Linton ignores him as he goes to join Bob Adriano waiting for him in his office.
23) 30) text: Hi. I'm calling from Karen Clark's office about a paper written by a staffer here. We need to know if 'Post War Planning: Parameters, Implication's and Possibilities' has reached Assistant Secretary of State Linton Barwick yet? (listens)
24) 1) dialog: I do not understand why anyone would choose to work in a glass office. In my opinion glass offices are for perverts.
24) 4) dialog: (as if Bob Adriano brought it up) Frosting is for cakes, Bob. Now. What happened in London?
24) 6) dialog: Pip what?
24) 8) dialog: What is that a report on - birdcalls? What does that stand for?
24) 10) dialog: We've got all the facts we need on this. In the land of truth, my friend, the man with one fact is king. You said there was another thing?
24) 12) dialog: (putting his hand over his mouth so he can't be lip- read) Which committee?
24) 14) dialog: Karen must not find out about that. She is an excitable yapping she-dog. Okay get the minutes of the meeting, we need to correct the record.
24) 17) dialog: Yes we can. They're an aide memoir for us. So they should not be a reductive record of what happened to be said, but a more full record of what was intended to be said. I think that's the more accurate version, right? LATER. Bob Adriano is going through the minutes with Linton.
24) 18) dialog: I don't like this section. Cut that. I don't think this is really what France are saying. Let's change that. And these. And let's reverse this.
24) 20) dialog: It's not right. Change it.
24) 22) dialog: And I like this.
24) 24) dialog: Let's say everyone agreed with this.
26) 0) text: 34 Karen, Liza and Linton are among those seated round the table. Various staffers are standing, including Chad. And Bob Adriano.
26) 2) dialog: I believe I've flagged everything I needed to discuss. As I usually do. 
26) 5) dialog: What is that, Karen
26) 7) dialog: What makes you think that?
26) 9) dialog: You must have misheard.
26) 11) dialog: Maybe it was another word. Like Khomeini.
26) 13) dialog: Possibly. There are a lot of words, Karen. Kansas City. Kitty.
26) 15) dialog: Itty is not a word, Bob.
26) 17) dialog: Thank you, James
26) 21) dialog: I'm Sorry, Karen, you appear to be bleeding from your mouth. She is. But she doesn't want to leave the meeting.
26) 25) dialog: I don't mean to be rude Karen but that is a tad... repulsive. I can't concentrate on what you're saying. You have blood coming out of your teeth and that's not right. Karen gets up to go. It's awkward, she's boxed in and has to clamber over the others to get to the door.
26) 29) dialog: I don't like to see a woman bleeding from the mouth. It makes me think of Country and Western music. Which I really can't abide.
26) 31) text: Yes! Ha ha! Exactly. Linton sees his chance to take advantage of Karen being out of the room.
26) 32) dialog: Actually while we're on Any Other Business I do have a few points I'd like to resolve. 
54) 0) text: Linton is with Adriano, quietly horrified by all these people. General Miller passes them.
54) 1) dialog: (For Miller's benefit) We seem to be overrun with insurgents here, Bob.
54) 3) dialog: The general is on rare form, very rare form.
55) 0) text: Linton calls the over-stuffed, standing-room-only room to order.
55) 1) dialog: Okay, due to the fact that seemingly everyone in the world who owns a suit has turned up for this meeting, we'll be relocating to a bigger room. Room 720. So, if you will be so kind...
57) 0) text: The committee members file in. Miller goes close up to Linton.
57) 2) dialog: Well, you're both here now. John and Yoko.
57) 4) text: Linton not fazed by this.
57) 5) dialog: Sure. How about 12:30 tomorrow, my office? 
57) 8) text: General Miller takes his seat. Linton turns on Adriano.
57) 9) dialog: What the hell happened?
57) 11) text: General Miller is sitting next to Karen. They're watching Linton having angry words with Adriano.
59) 1) dialog: So, welcome to this, somewhat engorged session of the Future Planning Committee. You can all see an agenda? People are looking at their agendas, low-level chatter, pouring of water, etc. - a general pre-meeting feel.
59) 3) dialog: It's the Future Planning Committee.
59) 5) dialog: Well, unofficially we can call anything whatever we like. (he holds up a water glass)
60) 4) dialog: That's way off agenda Karen. Although it would seem a general consensus may be forming.
60) 6) dialog: Well I noted with interest the recent comments of our colleague Simon Foster in that regard.
60) 11) dialog: As I say it seems a consensus is forming.
60) 13) dialog: Karen, please, calm down. We don't want you to have another hemorrhage. Item One. 
61) 0) text: 74 It's lunchtime. Lots of staffers have left their desks. A few are eating sandwiches at their desks, or reading a newspaper during lunch. Chad is emailing, reading, multi- tasking, from a corner of desk near Linton's office.
62) 0) text: Malcolm arrives at the committee just as people are spilling out. He's pissed off. Follows Linton into bathroom.
62) 3) dialog: Mr Tucker, isn't it? Hello again.
62) 5) dialog: What seems to be the problem?
62) 7) dialog: AJ? He is one of my top guys. Stanton College Prep, Harvard...he's smart and he's great at his job.
62) 9) dialog: I'm sorry if it troubles you that our people achieve excellence at a young age.
62) 10) text: Simon is emerging. Linton takes Malcolm to one side, out of Simon's earshot.
62) 11) dialog: By the way, your prime minister informs me that he's tasked you with collating some fresh British intel for us.
62) 13) text: Simon gets closer. Linton moves in.
62) 14) dialog: (to Simon) Minister, thank you so much for your support and your recent "Climb the mountain of conflict" comment - great. We're going to run with that, it has great repeatability. 
62) 17) dialog: It's early days, my friend. All roads lead to Munich. He smiles and walks off.
66) 0) text: General Miller (and an aide or two?) marches into Linton and Karen's section of State. He's got a meeting scheduled. He's a man on a mission. He marches straight past Bob Adriano ...
66) 3) text: And into Linton's office. But - it's empty.
74) 0) text: Karen runs out of the lifts. There's even more of a buzz than usual, people running around. She sees Bob Adriano, Linton and Chad in a huddle in Linton's air. Hurries over to Liza.
87) 0) text: Lots of delegates drinking and eating and chatting. We glimpse Linton, Karen, General Miller. Sir Jonathan is there, mingling. Malcolm approaches Simon, Toby, Judy and Sir Jonathan.
93) 0) text: Malcolm and Linton enter. We see Simon's mints lying on the big stone in the middle of the room.
93) 1) dialog: So we're down to the wire here, Mr Miracle Worker, what have you got for me? What intel have you rustled us up?
93) 3) dialog: You haven't got it? Can you delay the vote to give you time to get it?
93) 7) dialog: I am telling you to delay the vote and get me some new intel. Now.
93) 9) dialog: Well firstly, don't raise your voice. This is a sacred space. You may not believe that, I may not believe that, but by God it's a useful hypocrisy. And secondarily you do work for me. Your prime minister instructed you to work for me.
93) 12) text: Simon stays where he is. Linton starts laughing. Toby enters, watches in amazement.
93) 13) dialog: The great Malcolm Tucker. One of your guys has leaked a paper, you can't do anything. We tell you to get intel, you can't do anything. I need the vote put back - you can't do anything. You, sir, are a useless piece of `S' star star `T'.
93) 17) text: Linton laughs again.
93) 18) dialog: Why don't you deal with that Tucker? A wall is falling down, that's more your level. I can see you with your shirt off and a wheelbarrow whistling a happy song.
93) 19) text: Linton walks out. 
101) 2) dialog: What, you did your job? Eventually? Congratulations. Maybe they'll give you a knighthood.
102) 0) text: Linton, with Adriano now back beside him AND LIZA, is waiting for hush from the assembled US delegation, including Miller.
102) 1) dialog: Welcome aboard Liza. By the way, congratulations on Pwip Pip. Excellent work.
102) 3) dialog: I don't know. I haven't read it personally. No time. But it certainly raised your profile.
102) 5) dialog: Terrific. (to the delegation)
103) 1) dialog: We did it Bob!
103) 3) dialog: No there weren't, no.
106) 32) dialog: Okay, I don't want to be accused of micro managing but I personally do not see that `I heart Huckabees' should be on the list of dvds suitable for forces entertainment. That self-indulgent crap is not suitable entertainment for combat troops. And where's `United 93' on here? That should be playing 24/7. INT. CONSTITUENCY OFFICE. DAY. 122 Simon is back with Roz.
