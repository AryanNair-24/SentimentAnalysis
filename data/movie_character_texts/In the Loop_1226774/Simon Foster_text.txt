1) 20) dialog: Have we heard anything from Malcolm about last night's interview?
1) 22) dialog: Perhaps he didn't hear it.
1) 24) dialog: (with a degree of genuine hope)
1) 26) dialog: ...preventable sickness in many of the poorest countries round the world....and Of course the big one is diarrhoea, which is a major, major issue....
1) 31) dialog: And so if we can tackle the easy things, like diarrhoea, then we can.....
1) 33) dialog: ...and then hopefully that will strike another blow in the war against preventable diseases.
1) 37) dialog: Against preventable diseases, yes....
1) 39) dialog: Well....personally, I think that war is unforseeable.
1) 42) dialog: Yes.
2) 3) dialog: On Question Time, you know the funny question they always ask at the end?
2) 5) dialog: I think we should prep that now. I'd like to shine on the funny question, cos I'm a funny guy. With a light touch. SIMON deposits his briafcase. Judy finds some clippings, returns.
2) 7) dialog: Ah. Well, I can't say my wife, because I haven't got one, and I can't say my girlfriend, because I haven't got one of those either.
2) 9) dialog: No. Boring. And a bloke.
2) 11) dialog: Well, that's a good idea. 
2) 14) dialog: I don't think so.
4) 0) text: Simon and Judy are still prepping the funny question. ..

6) 0) text: Back inside Simon's office.
6) 1) dialog: Come on, Malcolm, he asked me for a personal opinion.
6) 3) dialog: I would have blacked up. It was the radio and no-one would have known.
6) 5) dialog: But war is -- basically unforeseeable isn't it?
6) 14) dialog: Hey Toby. Glad you could join us. Bit of an odd morning, but 'Welcome to the madhouse!'I apologise for Malcolm.
6) 22) dialog: We were thinking, weren't we Judy, that I could row back on Question Time tonight.
6) 25) dialog: Why? We've been prepping Question Time.
6) 34) dialog: But...okay, Judy's lubricated horse cock aside for one moment.... (Judy walks out)
6) 37) dialog: But I was going to keep to the line: "I don't actually think war is unforeseeable." 
6) 40) dialog: Is it...I don't know? Foreseeable? No.
6) 42) dialog: I'm a cabinet minister. I didn't get here by screwing up every media appearance I ever had.
6) 44) dialog: Right. So not inevitable, but not...evitable. Malcolm leaves the office. Toby is still hovering.
8) 7) text: Look, I've got a leg up for you. I think we could get Simon into the big meeting with Karen Clark?
9) 12) text: But she's gone. Toby heads over to Simon's office. The door's open. He pops his head in.
9) 14) dialog: Toby, hi. Sorry about earlier -- Malcolm. He's a bit of an...alpha male, isn't he?
9) 16) dialog: The Karen Clark meeting? Shit, really? Sure. How did you...?
9) 18) text: Judy walks past. Simon calls out. 
9) 20) dialog: Hey Judy. She comes in.
9) 22) dialog: Tobes here has got me into the big Karen Clark meeting. Judy looks at Toby. She heard the `meat' conversation.
9) 29) dialog: I think I can work a room, okay? I'm not a room virgin.
10) 0) text: Simon, Toby and Judy are going through security. Suzy and Michael come to meet them.
10) 2) dialog: Michael. 
11) 0) text: Chad's dual horse-shoe is packed with people. The room's pretty much full. KAREN CLARK from the State Department is surrounded by ten or so aides and functionaries, security people and assistants. (Including Chad and LIZA one of Karen's senior aides.) Then there is Bob Adriano's gang of advisors, smaller but sitting separately. Next to them is a Pentagon delegation, including uniformed members of all three services. Lots of hubbub. SUZY leads SIMON, TOBY and JUDY in, and shows them to their seats. 
11) 2) dialog: No-one will hear me if I say anything. How's your view? Can we swap?
11) 3) text: Simon and Toby swap seats, but Simon can still barely see anything.
11) 4) dialog: (to Judy) Can I swap with you?
11) 7) dialog: Well, quickly then, swap.
11) 8) text: Simon and Judy swap seats. The meeting is now underway. We're with Karen Clark.
11) 10) text: Back with Simon, Judy and Toby. Simon still straining to see.
11) 11) dialog: Are people thinking that? That's -- a bit hardcore.
11) 13) dialog: No, this is worse. Swap back.
11) 14) text: Simon and Judy swap seats again. Back with Karen. She's holding up a paper in a red folder. 
11) 31) dialog: (to Judy and Toby)
11) 34) dialog: I'm saying something ... I think I'm going to try saying something. Simon goes to put his hand up, Toby maybe puts a calming hand on his hand. They look at one another. Has Toby crossed a line?
11) 37) dialog: (pleased)
11) 40) dialog: She's talking about me!
11) 42) dialog: Well, yes, I mean, that's what I said. And I stick to what I said. SIMON sits down. Them stands back up.
11) 43) dialog: But that doesn't mean that what I said won't ever change. It's not imutable. Or mutable. It's an ongoing ... 
12) 0) text: The big meeting is breaking up. Simon is annoyed, leading Judy and Toby out of the room and into any private space he can find - they back into a huge huge ballroom
12) 1) dialog: Come here - we need to talk (they go into the massive room, look around)
12) 4) dialog: 'Meat in the room'? Oh for fuck's sake Judy. I took an hour out to come over here and be room meat? 
12) 7) dialog: Great, I'm not liver. What was I, tit meat?
13) 0) text: We're with Karen Clark's delegation who have just walked downstairs from the meeting room into a ground floor lobby area. KAREN is talking to LIZA, her right-hand woman. TOBY, SIMON and JUDY are above them standing round a circular viewing area that looks down on the lobby. The UK and US delegations are aware of each other, throwing furtive glances each other's way.
14) 1) dialog: (re : Karen talking conspiratorially to Liza downstairs) What's that all about? It looks important.
20) 0) text: The conversation is continuing between Simon Judy and Toby as they exit the FO.
20) 1) dialog: Yeah. Jesus. I really really hope there's not a war. It's going to be a nightmare. It's bad enough having to cope with the fucking Olympics. They appear outside. There's a press pack of 10 or so reporters and photographers there.
20) 3) dialog: Fuck. Who let the dogs out? We don't need this.
20) 5) dialog: What? No. No. I'll freestyle it. The press are calling.
20) 7) dialog: Look, (grappling now)
20) 11) dialog: What I'm saying is that to - walk the road of peace, sometimes you need to be ready to climb the mountain of conflict. Thank you!
20) 12) text: The press are writing furiously, making calls already. Simon tries to look confident. He and the team get into their car. 28   INT. CAR DRIVING THRU WESTMINSTER. DAY. (CHANGE SCENE ORDER - GOES AFTER SC. 29G)
20) 13) text: Toby Simon and Judy on the back seat as they drive back to the Department.
20) 14) dialog: (under his breath) Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck. (to Judy) Why didn't we nail the line?
20) 16) dialog: You did try to warn me but you didn't actually stop me, did you?. That's like shouting 'Train!' as I get hit by a train. You should go (stupid voice) 'Look! Train! There's a Fucking Train!'
20) 17) text: JUDY'S and SIMON'S phones start ringing. They each check the number.
20) 18) dialog: Oh shit. It's Malcolm.
20) 20) dialog: How does he do that? (he answers, tentatively) Hello? 
21) 0) text: Malcolm has two phones on the go. He's watching the SKY NEWS coverage of Simon's mini-press coverage. It has a `Government ready to Climb the Mountain of Conflict' banner running across the top.
21) 2) text: Simon.   I don't like finding out about people I work with via the news, unless they've died. Get over here now so we can address at least one of those issues.
22) 0) text: Judy, Simon and Toby are walking towards Malcolm's office.
22) 3) dialog: You can't say it's a resigning issue. Because you then have to resign.
22) 7) dialog: We can do without the ritual humiliation, Malcolm. You know I'm against talking up the war.
22) 12) dialog: I'm just saying. I might be forced to the verge of making a stand.
22) 14) text: Simon makes to leave with them.
22) 19) dialog: To where...?
22) 21) dialog: Oh. Right.
22) 23) dialog: Well, look - I don't know what words I used in the heat of the moment, but maybe in a sense I was on the verge. But that's the important thing - I was on the verge. Not in any way decided.
22) 25) dialog: I am standing my ground on the verge. 
22) 28) dialog: I'll give it a whirl.
22) 30) dialog: Oh right.    I won't talk to him.
25) 0) text: Judy's in her office on the phone, laughing. Simon's eyeing her suspiciously.
25) 1) dialog: What's she so fucking happy about? Is she laughing at me? Judy closes the blinds on her side of the office. SIMON (CONT'D) (cont'd)
25) 5) dialog: Yes. I do.
25) 7) dialog: Can we go somewhere else?
25) 9) dialog: So listen. My team for the US. Team Simon. I'm thinking of taking you and leaving Judy?
25) 11) dialog: "So you're the President? And I'm supposed to be impressed by that?
25) 13) dialog: "That's much harder than being President". Okay. It's settled. Fuck it. She's staying behind. Go and tell her.
29) 0) text: Simon and Toby walking past the queues at US immigration, they are being ushered through a separate channel by airport workers and diplomatic staff. As they're escorted Simon and Toby catch each other's eye.
29) 2) dialog: Don't be callow Toby. We're on official business.
29) 3) text: A Homeland Security official ushers them through. SIMON (CONT'D) (cont'd) This is a little bit fucking cool.
29) 5) dialog: There will be a car won't there?
29) 8) dialog: Did you book a car?
31) 4) text: There's a guy with a sign that says `England Government - Simon Forester'
31) 5) dialog: `Simon Forester?' 
32) 0) text: Simon and Toby are heading into Washington. Their car is accompanied by two police motorcycles.
32) 1) dialog: (re : the limo) I almost feel like there should be hookers. Do you know what I mean? Really, here, we should have hookers.
32) 4) dialog: (terrified of things getting out of hand) What? Oh no. God no. No no no no no. I was just - I was just joking. I don't want hookers. I hate hookers. I mean not in an aggressive way. I'm just not interested. (uncomfy beat, then) But thanks. Thanks very much.
35) 0) text: Simon and Toby enter with the porter. He hangs around for a tip. 
35) 2) dialog: Toby, have you....?
35) 4) text: SIMON finds two crumbled up one dollar bills and presses them into the porter's hand.
37) 22) dialog: Tobes. Hi. So! What's the plan? What swanky reception are we going to?
37) 25) dialog: Well that's what I'm asking you Toby, my chief aide, my political advisor.
37) 27) dialog: (approaching breaking point with Toby)
37) 30) dialog: Don't bullshit me Toby.
37) 32) dialog: No.

41) 0) text: Simon has just answered the door to MALCOLM. 
41) 2) dialog: Come in....I just wasn't expecting you to be here. Physically here. Obviously, you're always in my heart.
41) 4) dialog: Have you come to insult me in a different time zone?
43) 7) dialog: Okay. What's that? 
43) 19) dialog: I was watching that.
46) 0) text: Malcolm is     still in Simon's room. He's texting. Simon sneaks the     remote and flips from the news back to the shark doc.     Malcolm, without looking up, picks up the remote and     flicks back to the news.
46) 2) dialog: Right. Can I go to bed now?
46) 4) dialog: Am I being tortured? 
49) 0) text: Toby running. 61   INT. KAREN CLARK'S OFFICE. DAY. Karen, Liza and Simon are making small talk.

49) 8) dialog: Do they set fire to the paintings?
49) 12) dialog: Yes. He's, you know, among my guys.
49) 13) text: Toby shoots Simon a look.
49) 28) dialog: Er - no problem. They start to get up, not quite sure what's going on.
49) 30) dialog: Terrific.
50) 0) text: Simon and Toby walk out into a larger office. They find a couple of seats left out for people waiting and sit down. Various staffers come and go, picking up papers and files, saying hi, looking knackered, all drinking either diet cokes or coffees.
50) 2) dialog: Toby -- I don't want to read you the riot act here but I am going to have to read some extracts from the riot act. Like Section 1 paragraph 1 clause 1. Don't leave your boss twisting in the wind and then burst in late smelling like a pissed seaside donkey. (special needs)
50) 5) text: So I turned up late to the meeting Simon. I'm sorry. But it's not like I threw up in there. 
50) 7) dialog: No you're right. I should be thanking you for not throwing up. Well done. You're a star. You didn't wet yourself, you're in the right city, you didn't say anything overtly racist, you didn't pull your dick out and start plucking it and shouting 'willy banjo'. No I'm being unfair, you got so much right. Without actually being there for the beginning of one of the biggest meetings of my career. You're a legend.
50) 10) dialog: We'd barely said hello. I've had muggings that have lasted longer than that. We really only spoke about flammable cheese.
50) 31) dialog: Mate!
53) 0) text: Simon and Toby are looking through magazines and papers. Karen is exiting her office with an entourage.
53) 1) dialog: Here she comes - shit - look like we're meeting, look like we're having a meeting!
53) 4) dialog: (like he's busy) Yeah, yeah sure, see you in a mo. Just finishing off some stuff. (to Toby loud) Okay, we're all done there. Let's roll.
53) 7) dialog: Shut up. Follow them. Don't lose them. Lets rock. 
53) 10) dialog: Hello.
53) 12) dialog: See you there. I don't need to ... do any of the things you need to go in there to do, so I'll just see you there.
53) 13) text: Karen goes into the toilet. Simon and Toby head off looking sheepish. As they head out of the vestibule. There is a gaggle of Karen hangers-on. Chad-type staffers looking to get in with Karen.
54) 6) dialog: (And...?) Right, yep. There he is. 
57) 14) text: Simon is sitting with Toby, marvelling at the numbers of people cramming into the room.
57) 15) dialog: I'm room meat again. This is a massive abattoir of room meat. Stay outside Tobes, I need a guy on the outside. Make friends with Chad, that boy from The Shining. He knows stuff. Pump him.
57) 17) dialog: I'm making you pump Chad. Go on.
57) 19) dialog: It'll be easy peasy lemon squeezy.
60) 7) text: Simon is texting under the desk and not really paying full attention. He hears his name, looks up, waves to the group. He doesn't clock Karen's intense look that says `You are going to rebut that, aren't you?'
60) 9) dialog: (politely) I'm just...watching with interest. IN Britain we have a saying for complicated situations such as this, which is that it's (he can't believe he's going to say this) `Difficult, difficult, lemon, difficult.'
62) 10) text: Simon is emerging. Linton takes Malcolm to one side, out of Simon's earshot.
62) 13) text: Simon gets closer. Linton moves in.
62) 16) dialog: Thanks very much, but...it's all a bit complex really, in terms of my... Linton pulls away, starts walking off.
62) 19) dialog: Well it just means...I guess, I don't know what it means.
63) 0) text: Malcolm, Toby, and Simon are heading towards their car. They see the Washington Monument in the distance.
63) 1) dialog: It's beautiful.
63) 5) dialog: Oh no. Should we send Mark a card?
63) 8) dialog: So what are we getting back to? Apart from a nice cup of tea and some knife crime?
63) 10) dialog: Great, meeting my constituents. It's like being Simon Cowell, but without the ability to say, `Fuck off, you're mental.'
64) 0) text: TOBY and SIMON are with Simon's constituency agent, ROZ, she's ushering them into the small, damp little constituency office. ROZ's arm is in a sling (Jo Scanlon's arm actually is in a sling) and she has difficulty opening the door
64) 2) text: Simon kicks the bottom of the door to unstick it. Roz opens the door. There are a few constituents waiting to see Simon, he nods a hello.
64) 3) dialog: (Roz has gone ahead, this is to Toby) Look at them. They all have that smell....like a charity shop, you know? (to constituents) Afternoon!
64) 6) dialog: I'm just back from America, so it was pretty tough to make it up here - but you know. That's me.
64) 9) dialog: Good actually.
64) 11) dialog: Blown up by spaceships.
67) 0) text: 80 Simon listens behind a desk. Roz is there taking notes. Toby is in the corner working on a laptop. 
67) 3) dialog: Yes. No. I understand.
67) 7) dialog: No, of course not. Nor should you be treated like one. Okay, Mrs McDairmid. Leave it with me. I'm sure there must be a way through this. Alright?
67) 10) dialog: Jesus. Still on about bendy buses? (thinks) No. Tell him no. What else?
67) 15) dialog: Hi Paul, call me Simon. You've met Roz. 
67) 18) dialog: Lovely.
67) 20) dialog: Yes, well, this place can become a magnet for the mentally dispossessed. And for sensible people like yourself, Paul.
67) 25) dialog: That...I agree, it's unacceptable. Toby comes back in, hands Simon a coffee.
67) 28) dialog: (checks notes)
67) 32) dialog: Right. Paul, I really need to take this, but I haven't forgotten about you, okay?
67) 34) dialog: Toby, can I hand Paul over to you?
69) 0) text: Simon is talking to Karen.
69) 4) dialog: Well, yeah. I mean, your lot are probably getting it somehow, but our lot shouldn't be.
69) 8) dialog: Departmental business. About a wall.
69) 10) dialog: Uh-huh. What can I do for you?
69) 12) dialog: Well - okay. Yes. Um. Well, I have to say Karen, I have a clear strategy here. I'm playing the long game.
69) 14) dialog: We don't call it that, no...
70) 5) text: Simon wants to talk. Roz takes over.
70) 9) dialog: That guy's a bit full-beam.
70) 11) dialog: Yeah, full-beam. Headlights. (he opens his eyes wide to show what he means) I kept thinking, is he going to nut me. He appears not to be nutting me, but he might well nut me.
70) 13) dialog: Do you think I came over as weak on the committee over there?
70) 15) text: Simon's phone goes again. He winces picks up.
71) 4) dialog: I find that difficult to believe.
71) 7) dialog: (to the phone) You don't work here. You're not my boss. Fuck off. You can't make me sack people.
72) 0) text: Simon is getting into his office - he and Toby are back from the constituency office.
72) 1) dialog: We need to talk in my office.
72) 3) dialog: (patronising) I think you know.
72) 4) text: A land line is ringing in the open plan office. Judy picks up. Simon has gone into his office and has assumed the bollocking position.
72) 6) text: Judy punches a button on her phone. Toby's land line starts ringing. Simon comes out.
72) 7) dialog: (walking backwards into his office) Come, come into my office.
72) 14) dialog: (following her out, exasperated) Can you come into my office so I can tell you off?
72) 19) text: Malcolm pushes Judy back into Simon's office as she's leaving it, Simon behind Judy walks backwards to his desk, the three of them in a line. Malcolm shuts the door and unleashes a torrent of abuse we can't hear.
73) 19) text: Toby can still see Malcolm going ballistic at Simon and Judy in Simon's office. 
75) 0) text: Malcolm is with Simon and Toby. Malcolm has a local Northamptonshire paper.
75) 2) dialog: It doesn't say that.
75) 4) dialog: Wall-ace though? 
75) 9) dialog: Oh great. The crossest man in Scotland.
75) 12) dialog: What is this, surround bollocking?
75) 14) dialog: Hi Jamie.
75) 20) text: Simon, Toby and Jamie look at him. 
75) 27) dialog: A walrus? I'm not fat. I don't even have a moustache.
76) 0) text: Simon and Judy on their way into the foreign office. Malcolm has gone in ahead. Suzy chatting on the stairs with Toby. Simon draws Judy to one side.
76) 1) dialog: This is all getting...this is a really stressful job, you know that?
76) 3) dialog: I don't want to back a war, Judy. 
76) 7) dialog: Look, drop some hints, put some nods and winks out there, that I'm toying with resignation. Yeah? See if the PM reacts. See how it plays.
76) 9) dialog: And nods.
76) 11) dialog: No, no, just sort of... (he does a small nod) That sort of size nod.
76) 13) dialog: No, not that much.
76) 15) dialog: Oh. Good.
77) 9) dialog: What the fuck, Malcolm. This is all going to spin along from here and we have a vote and we go to war. We fight people, and kill them, and our kids get killed, and that's exactly the sort of thing I didn't want to do when I went into politics. That's the opposite of what I want to be doing.
77) 11) dialog: Only because the Sun showed a photo of her with wide eyes and her head on a cow.
77) 13) dialog: I know the Prime Minister isn't a Viking, Malcolm.
77) 18) dialog: Where's the intelligence? Where's the hard evidence?
77) 22) text: Prime Minister wants to speak to you in ten minutes, Simon. He want you to go the UN. Malcolm's heading out.
77) 24) dialog: (shouting to Malcolm)
81) 0) text: Simon, Toby and Judy are on the way to Heathrow.
81) 1) dialog: Should I resign? I've floated that I might, when I thought I wouldn't, so it'll look convincing if I did. I mean, do you think, is it braver to just resign and say, `No, no war'?
81) 3) dialog: Or is it actually braver to say, `I don't agree, but I'm going to grit my teeth and get on with it?' Is the really brave thing actually doing what you don't believe?
81) 6) dialog: I know what you mean. And the Crimean War -- we got nurses out of that.
81) 8) dialog: (as if they've achieved something)
81) 12) dialog: No, I..(trying to change the subject) where's Malcolm?
82) 0) text: Judy, Simon and Toby are walking past a baggage carousel.

82) 3) dialog: I want to talk about the resigning thing.

83) 0) text: Simon and Toby looking very uptight. Malcolm's with them.
83) 2) dialog: What? That wasn't supposed to get outside.

89) 4) text: Simon! There he is! Simon. (re internet)
89) 6) dialog: Ah okay. They're not running with that? I have not said that.
89) 9) dialog: It's much subtler than that. It's nuanced. I'm playing a much cleverer game than that. I'm a (whispering)
89) 13) dialog: (whispering) Fake hawk.
89) 15) text: Karen and Miller go into a confab. Karen and Miller immediately go into a huddle and start planning Simon's future.
89) 17) dialog: Sorry?
89) 19) dialog: What? You can't.
89) 23) dialog: No. No it's bloody not. I'm - me. You're not me. I decide about all the main things about me, okay? Not you. Me.
89) 27) dialog: Like a suicide bomber?
91) 0) text: Simon is sitting in the Meditation Room, a stark chapel- like room with a big piece of granite in the middle of it. He's biting his nails, thinking. Judy comes in.
91) 2) dialog: I'm thinking of becoming a suicide bomber.
91) 5) dialog: Would you like a mint?
