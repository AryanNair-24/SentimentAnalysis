Ralibos rolls, flips onto his feet and gives Perseus a look: "You're the one that I want." They face off, looking for an opening. Perseus lunges, thrusting his sword. Kalibos dodges, springing up the rocks and then down toward Perseus, acrobatic as an ape. Perseus rolls out of the way. Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos' head. The monster catches the blade in his jaws and SNAPS IT IN TWO! Bloody spittle flies from his tongue. Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus. He opens his jaw and sinks his teeth into Perseus' shoulder.

The men can't see it, but one wall suddenly frames a silhouette of MEDUSA: HAIR OF HISSING SNAKES atop a woman's torso, the body of a mammoth reptile. WE SEE only GLIMPSES of Medusa as she slides through the shadows. Her forked tongue tastes the air. CUTTING BETWEEN Spyros, Perseus and Draco, moving silently on opposite sides of the sanctuary. OUR VIEW of Draco is suddenly BLOCKED by Medusa -- she coils around Draco without touching him. He HEARS the RASP of SCALES ON STONE.
