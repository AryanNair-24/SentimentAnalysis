The Onlookers watch in terrified awe as the swell races closer. Leviathan explodes from the surface, too huge to be seen whole. It shoots straight up, up, up the three-hundred- foot cliffs. The Kraken's jaws hurtle up at Andromeda. Onlookers recoil. Fantasos stumbles in panicked retreat. The creature's BELLOW is deafening.

Distraught, his muscles go taut around Andromeda, and a short powerful burst of electric energy shoots from his arms into her still body -- SHE JOLTS TO LIFE! Movement! Breath! Color returns to her face. Perseus, too, breathes again, relieved. For the first time since the start of the adventure, they find themselves alone, holding each other.
139) 3) dialog: I think I am. He smiles. She'll never know how close they came to oblivion.
139) 4) dialog: Are you ready to become a king? His expression is kind, but unmistakable. "No." She accepts that, rueful.
