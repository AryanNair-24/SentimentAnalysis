37) 3) dialog: It was such a long time ago, dear. And I met your grandfather and over the years I did my best to forget that summer in Tuscany and the bronzed Adonis of a boy who kissed me for the first time. He was the first person to ever tell me I was beautiful. And boy did it sound more romantic in Italian.
37) 5) dialog: “Clara, siete cosi bella.”
37) 7) dialog: That's exactly right - happy enough. We were a “good couple” with much to be grateful for. Except for you Charlie, you’ve been the bane of my existence. Sophia smiles, intrigued by these two.
37) 8) dialog: Then when Jack died - there’s a lot of Jack in Charlie, funnily enough - I grieved profoundly for years.

Then, unexpectedly, at odd hours of the day, in my dreams at night, I found myself thinking about Alfonso... which made it all the more extraordinary when, out of the blue, your letter arrived. I’m so grateful you wrote it. There were so many reasons not to.
37) 11) dialog: Well the thing is, I think we've found him.
37) 13) dialog: Just outside Verona. Quite close to where he used to live, actually.

He used to say all he needed to be happy were days in those fields and nights with me. Sophia smiles at this.

42) 2) dialog: A bit I suppose. What if I’ve turned him into something he isn’t? He’s always existed in my mind’s eye as a model of perfection. Like a ‘57 Bentley Continental. What if he’s actually a clapped out old Alfa Romeo with bundles of nose hair? What if he doesn’t remember me at all - if I was simply not to him what he was to me?
