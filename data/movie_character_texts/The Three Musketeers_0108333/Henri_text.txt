51) 5) dialog: It's a young man. He appears to be injured.
54) 52) text: The chamber door flies open. Henri and Parker, the Indo- Chinese bodyguard, appear. Parker faces d'Artagnan with a half-smile. He holds out his hands, both empty. And steps toward him. D'Artagnan looks at the dagger in his right hand. Then, unwilling to fight the man with an un- fair advantage, he tosses the dagger to the side, steps forward to meet him. Parker disposes of d'Artagnan with lightning speed. A series of unexpected kicks, brutally efficient blows. The young man is unfamiliar with, and no match for, the martial arts. Parker hoists d'Artagnan to his feet, dazed. Henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions. Milady straightens her dressing gown, adjusts her hair, and commands:
54) 54) text: Parker holds him fast. Henri steps forward.        And d'Artagnan thinks fast.

Milady's bodyguards dismount, six of them. A motley bunch of sinister killers. They look around the pier, ready for any encounter. D'Artagnan takes in his surroundings.    There is a mel- ancholy air about him.
60) 0) text: Henri calls out to the ship, which is little more than an outline in the fog, her boarding gangplank leading to the soupy darkness of her deck.
60) 1) dialog: We are the Countess de Winter's party, arrived from Paris. Permission to come aboard. There is no reply.    Closely guarded by Parker, d'Artagn strains to see.
60) 6) text: Milady nods to Henri. He steps up the narrow gangplank, followed by Milady, d'Artagnan, Parker, and the six bodyguards.
