83) 6) dialog: The purpose of decapitation is to preserve  as much...food...as possible. The purpose  for feeding is to keep the beasts on our  side. The fact that they can be taught to  clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a  convenient side benefit, not the primary  goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves  from becoming their supper. Keep them fed  and they behave. Keep them hungry and they  revert back to being the animals that they  have always been. You saw them in there.
