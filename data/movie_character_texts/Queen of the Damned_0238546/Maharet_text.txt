68) 19) dialog: Wait. Never mind Lestat!   We have greater problems...
68) 22) dialog: Don't be so happy, Pandora. I knew Akasha when she walked this earth. I was her slave. I am now her enemy. I know what she is capable of.
68) 27) dialog: She knows only one thing. Taking pleasure in destroying life. She is already killing the young ones to build her strength.

77) 8) text: Why can't I stay with you?! Please, Auntie Maharet!
77) 9) dialog: I don't want you to go, but you must. A tear of blood trickles down Maharet's cheek.

77) 27) dialog: You are the most precious of my great family...

77) 31) dialog: This is our family -- my way of coping with eternity. The labyrinth of life. The family teaches me the rhythms and passions of each age.
77) 35) dialog: You are my most prized light. You are what keeps me connected to the world of the living.
77) 36) text: Jesse stares at Maharet, amazed.

77) 42) text: Jesse looks at her, surprised.    Maharet smiles.
77) 43) dialog: Yes, I know about your new friend. You think you love him, but it's not as you thought it would be.
77) 44) text: Jesse stares at Maharet, surprised she understands so well.
77) 46) dialog: I know, but it is not who you are, not who you are meant to be. You have found that out now.

80) 0) text: Jesse moves down the hallway past paintings of vampires. She pauses at one of Maharet. As Jesse shifts, the glass over the painting catches Jesse's reflection.

89) 39) dialog: She is here...
93) 0) text: Mael leads Jesse down the hall. She stares ahead at what looks like statues standing in the shadows. Her eyes widen as the statues come to life: Armand, Pandora, Khayman, Marius are talking in hushed tones, gathered before Maharet's "Great Family Tree." CAMERA SWEEPS OVER the endless lines, the rows of names that stretch down the stone wall -- ACROSS the floor, filling room after room. The Ancients all stare, deeply moved. Maharet turns to them.
93) 1) dialog: We see now what Akasha means to do. Rule as Queen again. (pointing to the great family) This is why we must fight Akasha!

99) 18) dialog: Akasha. The world has changed since you reigned.
99) 20) dialog: We've found other ways to co- exist.
99) 22) text: She casts a dangerous eye towards Jesse. Maharet instinctively moves forward to protect her.
99) 27) text: Maharet doesn't even flinch.

99) 46) text: Maharet steps between Lestat and Jesse.
99) 47) dialog: You will not touch her!
99) 48) text: Akasha flicks her wrist. Maharet is hurled against a pillar, pinned by Akasha's hand.
99) 50) dialog: I beg you, spare this child.

99) 54) text: Maharet stops, standing fixed with the sound of Jesse's newly strong and calm voice. Jesse looks to Lestat, straight into his dark irises, her gaze absolutely unwavering.

99) 77) text: (NOTE: Scene as scripted here is quite different from what was analyzed in boards. Notable potential expense or savings indicated with brackets. []) But Lestat clamps down even harder.       Akasha thrashes trying to release herself. Maharet and Marius realize what he's doing, see the chance Lestat has gained for them. A silent signal passes between them as... The Ancients make an instantaneous decision. Akasha looks up, gasping, in time to see Maharet, Marius, Khayman, Armand, Mael, Pandora flying towards her. Akasha lets out a hiss... Most of the Ancients are thrown to the ground while Mael ignites in mid-air. Mael's skin bubbles. He screams, the veins in his face rise up and explode as if his blood were burning acid... Pandora too bursts into flames.       She falls to the gr But Lestat, strong with Akasha's blood, keeps his hold and Khayman, Armand, Marius, Maharet fly at her again. They swarm over Akasha. She rises into the air, thrashing about, but they hang on, forming a flying mass of flailing limbs. The THUMP of Akasha's HEART ACCELERATES as they try to drain her... Akasha turns on [Khayman to incinerate him. Flash. He screams as his blood boils, exploding out of his fingertips -- But he doesn't ignite... His wounds quickly heal. He moves in for another attack...]
99) 83) dialog: Wait, Lestat! You must stop!
99) 84) text: Lestat pulls away, leaving Akasha hanging in a twisted, unnatural angle. They all stare waiting to see what will happen... ... Maharet moves quickly. She strides over to Akasha and sinks her fangs into Akasha's neck. Akasha struggles but this time she cannot even rise up. Maharet does not stop. A HOWLING sound as if from hell fills the room. The Ancient Ones stare at Akasha, step back in awe. Lestat sits up, burned but still alive to see... Akasha's skin begins to grow horribly pale, to harden and cake into a chalk. There's no blood left to flow from the gaping holes in Akasha's flesh. She slowly begins to transform back to her frozen statue state. Her skin returning to MARBLE. CRACKS multiply, becoming fissures. Finally, Akasha literally falls to pieces, SMASHING on the stone floor like porcelain. A silent moment. The Ancient Ones look at each other, astonished, as they realize they're still "alive."
99) 96) text: He holds her tight in his arms. All the Ancients gaze at Lestat, now understanding what he did. Slowly Jesse rises, gazes at Lestat, her face pale, her eyes glowing.

Jesse goes to her.
