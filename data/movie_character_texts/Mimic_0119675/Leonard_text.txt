Peter looks up to see Leonard approaching from the track.

The abdomen CRASHES through a pane of glass.

79) 5) dialog: What the fuck was that? Peter says nothing. Leonard grabs him by the shirt.
79) 6) dialog: You better tell me what the hell's going on here!

79) 11) dialog: Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to- SNAP!  The Mimic POUNCES on him, catching his leg in its front mandibles. A sickening CRUNCH as the Mimic's mouth begins to work th leg like a grinder-blender.

80) 15) dialog: How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
80) 39) dialog: Get the doors! A brief glimpse down the car shows too many OTHER DOORS t close in time.
80) 41) dialog: Third rail is dead. (To Manny and Susan.)

80) 83) dialog: (covers his nose)
80) 89) dialog: What are you putting that crap on me for?
80) 93) dialog: Okay. That's us. Manny's lighter represents the subway car.
80) 94) dialog: This track we're on? Goes down into the repair area. (Makes an "X" further down)
80) 97) dialog: Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
80) 99) dialog: Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
80) 103) dialog: It would take a minute or so. (beat)
80) 113) dialog: It's just a regular old pump switch, okay? Right by the track signal board. Manny is spreading the mucus-like liquid of the gland-sac himself and Peter as Leonard instructs them-
80) 114) dialog: The lights come up, you pull the switch.
80) 116) dialog: You don't do that, we're on the wrong track. (turns to Peter)
80) 118) dialog: You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
80) 120) dialog: All right then.  You gonna find two wires.  One's green.  The other's blue...
80) 130) dialog: Okay, people... Leonard's voice comes through like a clarion.
80) 131) dialog: ...are we ready for this? Susan has her hand on Peter's chest; Peter is taking deep breaths, trying to cool down his body to prevent sweat. an odd parody of Lamaze exercise.
80) 132) dialog: Whatever you do, don't step on the third rail coming back. Six hundred volts'll blow your leg right off. A final breath.  He's about as calm as he's going to get. He looks at Susan a long moment. He takes her hand.

82) 0) text: Manny enters. The space is even more dusty than the rest the station. Spiderwebs strung over old machinery.  White Doric PILLARS support the ceiling like skeletal bones.  1 style LAMPS are built into their side. Manny looks around.  Off to the right, right next to the rusted track switch board, he heads for the COUPLING SWIT Once there, he rests and, through the murky windows, he waves back to LEONARD. He pulls out his pills box and takes a pill. But his hand are shaking, under enormous tension. Some of the pills scatter on the floor. He puts the box away and leans against the wall. A CLICKING nearby catches his attention, echoing from the entrance of ANOTHER ROOM. It is not the sound of the Mimics; but rather, of METAL. Spoons.
83) 10) dialog: (tense as hell)

83) 85) dialog: NOW!! GO!! Get the hell off my beat! Leonard turns away from them. Peter goes to get Leonard, but Susan stops him.  This MTA officer is staying put.

83) 87) dialog: takes a stand by the third rail, baton in hand.
85) 0) text: Leonard stands like a guardian to the tunnel mouth. SOUNDS of the Mimics approaching. He glances at the third rail beside him, then down the track.
85) 1) dialog: Come here, you mealy-mouthed... The sound gets louder.
85) 2) dialog: Multi-legged... Leonard raises his baton in top MTA form.
85) 3) dialog: Maggot-munchin' motherfu... THUD!  Several Mimcs slam onto Leonard! Leonard goes down, HITTING them futilely with his baton. They begin to tear at his limbs. Leonard rolls... ...kicks his good leg out... ...and CONNECTS WITH THE THIRD RAIL. AN ARC of ELECTRICITY lights up the darkness, consuming Leonard and the Mimics.
