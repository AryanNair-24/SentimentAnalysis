White Doric PILLARS support the ceiling like skeletal bones.  1 style LAMPS are built into their side. Manny looks around.  Off to the right, right next to the rusted track switch board, he heads for the COUPLING SWIT Once there, he rests and, through the murky windows, he waves back to LEONARD. He pulls out his pills box and takes a pill. But his hand are shaking, under enormous tension. Some of the pills scatter on the floor. He puts the box away and leans against the wall.

Its form is different from the other Mimics.  Sleeker, mo supple, almost beautiful.  And while its movements are st not completely human, there is a kind of unearthly grace them that at the very least entrance us. The thing raises itself to full height, dwarfing the tiny boy.  It stands over him like a king over his court fool. Chuy giggles happily.  It's all a game to him. The Albino CLICKS in response -- a long, leisurely sound, if trying to communicate with the boy. Chuy pulls his spoons out and begins to play them, making perfect imitation of the sound. Manny starts to tremble as the creature gazes upon him wi huge, expressionless 'eyes'.  He turns to Chuy-
