25) 73) dialog: I didnвЂ™t mean it the way it sounded. I know how much the two of you loved each other
25) 74) dialog: I just suppose that I was always a bit jealous that you and I never had that kind of love. Actually I've never had that kind of love with anyone.

He slips his arm around her as she attempts to wriggle away.
25) 81) dialog: I only have you now because you lost Jim, but IвЂ™1l lose you again soon to someone else. ItвЂ™s not as easy for a woman. I did everything the way that I was supposed to and all I have to keep me company is a bottle of gin.
25) 83) dialog: Screw you! 68.
25) 85) dialog: You have all the goddamn answers donвЂ™t you? If you're so smart why arenвЂ™t YOU making something new happen in your life? (beat) IвЂ™m serious. Why donвЂ™t you take that position at Stanford? Why do you keep teaching at that little school when you could have any position you want?
25) 87) dialog: IвЂ™m sorry, I shouldn't have said that. (beat) As much as I dread it, I think I might move back to London.
