22) 20) dialog: What?
23) 2) dialog: ...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?

29) 10) text: It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely! He grabs a flashlight from his car and shoves it in Sara' hand.

30) 3) dialog: Looks like we're it.
30) 18) dialog: Uh, excuse me -- but does anybody know any logical reason why those little demons would be moving? She's pointing to the skylight.
30) 27) dialog: Is she...alright?
30) 47) dialog: Of course he did, for God's sake. (beat)
33) 5) dialog: Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
33) 7) dialog: What're you talking about?
33) 21) dialog: Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
33) 28) dialog: This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
33) 37) dialog: What's going on?
44) 8) dialog: What does that mean? Blackburn takes the liquor and begins cleaning/disinfecti Pritchett's wounds.
44) 17) dialog: -- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
44) 19) dialog: Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
44) 22) dialog: Well, flip a coin and somebody dial 911!
44) 24) dialog: Why not? And then, simultaneously, we hear the same beep-beep-beep from the three cellular phones and see the same flashing message on their LED screens: "No Service - No Service - Service."
44) 32) dialog: There is something seriously screwed-up going on here, and I don't believe it's about ghosts --
44) 43) dialog: Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
44) 45) dialog: Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
44) 47) dialog: No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find reverse on this thing and floor it.
44) 49) dialog: Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight. Pritchett leaps to his feet.
44) 54) text: Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find. Sara glares at her, but does as she's told: goes to the l ebony casket that supports Evelyn's BIRTHDAY CAKE. Sara l back at Evelyn suspiciously... then sets the cake aside a lifts the lid. Inside that, seemingly free floating in space, are SIX MI COFFINS -- no more than eight inches long, their doors likewise propped open, revealing inside each a gleaming n GLOCK 9mm AUTOMATIC. Each pistol black gunmetal in color, course.
44) 58) dialog: I'm in stitches. Sara takes one of the guns and attempts to eject the magazine. Nothing happens. She looks:
44) 59) dialog: The clip's been welded shut.
44) 64) dialog: I don't want a gun, I just want out. Let's go, for God's sake.
44) 67) text: Take the gun. Sara takes the pistol from Evelyn, and Pritchett unenthusiastically beckons Eddie and Sara towards a hallw leading to the basement. Price trots towards another door the Salon.

49) 0) text: Sara, Eddie and Pritchett continue searching.
49) 1) dialog: You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
49) 5) dialog: Good way to get your head blown off.
49) 9) text: Nothing. Sara takes the flashlight from Pritchett's hand and aims into the dark hole beyond.
49) 11) dialog: Nothing? That seems like quite a door to hold back "nothing". Pritchett just stares at the door for an uncomfortably lo moment...
49) 15) dialog: Ghosts killed your father?
49) 17) dialog: And you think it's in there?
52) 7) dialog: (grabbing Eddie's arm)

58) 1) dialog: -- better than nothing. Down, big fella'. Eddie lowers her back down to earth -- his hand lingering a moment on her bottom. Their eyes meet for a nanosecond.
58) 2) dialog: Thanks.
58) 4) dialog: You need to get out more. They start walking down the weirdly pulsing corridor.
58) 6) dialog: What? Deep down inside?
58) 8) dialog: I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
58) 10) dialog: Why not?
58) 12) dialog: (grinning)
58) 15) dialog: The truth is, if we keep taking rights, we're going to have to end up where we started. She beckons him to follow her, starts walking down the corridor to the right.
58) 16) dialog: Look, we're all gonna be out of here in a little while and go our separate ways, all a million bucks richer. What's it matter who I am or who I'm not? There's no response from Eddie.
58) 17) dialog: Okay... So let's say, hypothetically, I'm not exactly who I should be -- okay, so you're right, you're a genius, I don't know anybody who could've ever seen right through me like that -- does that end the discussion? No response from Eddie.
58) 18) dialog: Alright, look: my real name is Sara, and I'm a secretary -- was, anyway -- to the real Jennifer Bitch who was invited here, and now you know and I'm begging you don't tell anybody, 'cuz I'm out of a job and could really use even a tenth of that money, okay? No response from Eddie.

65) 1) dialog: Okay, you win. You've successfully creeped me out. -- and then her EYES GO WIDE as she spots EDDIE -- perched above a Vat -- he's teetering, his equilibrium like a marionette's -- in danger of dropping right into the Vat!
65) 2) dialog: What are you doing -- -- Eddie drops like a stone into the Vat.
65) 3) dialog: -- Eddie!! She scrambles up to the top of the Vat, looks down into i nothing but that thick opaque muck -- but there's SOMETHI ROILING beneath it. Sara plunges her arms down into it --

73) 8) dialog: Maybe....maybe she went up on the table. Price runs a finger along the table bed; he's able to dig trench the entire length of it through the three-inches-d worth of dust.
73) 11) dialog: No...not air -- The three men turn to look at her -- Sara's staring at something above them: a spot on the... CEILING directly o the Operating Table, where the bloody DRAG MARKS resume, continuing all the way to the point where concrete ceilin meets equally solid wall, and then vanish altogether.
73) 12) dialog: -- into the House. They just stare at the sight in dead, scared-shitless silence.
74) 10) dialog: Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here. We see that Sara's sitting at a desk in the room, fiddlin with the innards of Melissa Marr's camcorder.
74) 12) dialog: An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.

94) 2) dialog: Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work. Eddie pulls a picture from the wall... The glass is cracked. Sara looks back at Eddie and moves to him. SARA (cont'd)

109) 3) dialog: (sensing something)
109) 6) dialog: All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.
109) 10) dialog: Move! -- then BOLTS reluctantly down the hall. Just as THE THIN OF SHADOWS drops down from the ceiling; begins spreading across the floor and sinking into the floorboards. Disappearing. And then a terrible SILENCE.

118) 0) text: Sara leaps to her feet and tries to reach for the hole in ceiling - it's just out of reach. Then she senses something else in there with her.

Suddenly from the swirling dark center of the mass... THE FLAMING HEAD OF DR. RICHARD VANNACUTT appears... BLASTING HOT BREATH at Pritchett, who is freaking out.
125) 8) dialog: I think if you're coming, Mr. Pritchett, it's now or never. The Mass of Faces starts to creep up Pritchett's shoe. Wi screech, he flings himself backwards, literally diving through the open window --
