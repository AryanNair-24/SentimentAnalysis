29) 3) dialog: Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So... The Camcorder Woman steps out of Hearse #3: a Jenny Jones clone named MELISSA MARR, 27.
29) 5) dialog: Not with you, is he? Well, I'm sure he'll turn up any second now... If you'll just come along... The Muscular Young Man from Hearse #4 steps out: a good- looking specimen named EDDIE MOSES, 23.
29) 7) dialog: I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to -- And then Sara-as-Jenzen regally alights from Hearse #1.
29) 9) dialog: (a forced chuckle)
29) 11) dialog: Just point and walk, sis -- the place is right up -- -- and as if on cue, a battery of magnesium floods sudden light up the night like high noon, revealing the House in its glory.
29) 12) dialog: (startled)
29) 16) dialog: Wish I could take the credit, but --
29) 18) dialog: He must've beaten us all here!
29) 20) dialog: Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
29) 23) dialog: (brightly)
29) 24) text: You'll never know 'til you walk through that door! Eddie dismisses him with a flap of his hand and sprints t catch up with the others. Pritchett yells after him:
29) 25) dialog: You wouldn't consider getting my check and running it back down here? No response. Beat. Pritchett gets out of his car.
29) 26) dialog: Didn't think so. Asshole. He starts jittering his way up the drive.
30) 7) dialog: Not at all! They turn to see Pritchett's head poking through the door -- putting as little of himself as possible inside the ho proper.
30) 8) dialog: Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
30) 11) dialog: Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
30) 13) dialog: Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do? He laughs weakly; starts shouting again:
30) 14) dialog: Mr. Price?? Mrs. Price?? Melissa Marr continues to shoot up a storm of tape in the room, as overexcited as a five-year-old who's lost her Ritalin.
30) 33) dialog: (looking away)
30) 48) text: Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
30) 49) dialog: I can't comment until I get paid.
30) 51) dialog: Mr. Price??? No response from anyone. Pritchett's eyes jitterbug all around him -- he sees he's standing there alone. As nonchalantly as he can, he quick -- steps towards the Sal and the others -- passing right by a barely perceptible black dot in the wall, no larger than a dime --
33) 0) text: Just off the foyer. The furniture, though dust-caked and rotting is antique Deco and sumptuous. Liquor and a lavis buffet have been set out on a sideboard that looks like o of Dali's limp pocket-watches. As Price enters the room grimly, he's descended upon by an angry Pritchett:
33) 1) dialog: Mr. Price: I've done everything we agreed on, your guests are all here and in one piece -- my 25 thousand now, please. Price produces an envelope froa his jacket and taps it.
33) 13) dialog: I'm ready now.
33) 15) dialog: Two "T"s at the end of the name. Price looks up, puts the pen down.
33) 30) dialog: -- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
33) 33) dialog: -- my loss --
33) 35) dialog: Wouldn't know what to do with it all -- -- and then, suddenly, we hear the distant sound of heavy MACHINES at work. Pritchett freezes for a moment.
33) 36) dialog: Oh, no.
35) 0) text: Where Pritchett is sprinting like a madman to the exit.
35) 1) dialog: Please -- God-in-Heaven, no --
39) 0) text: BAM! The front door being likewise sealed by a descending IRON PLATE -- nearly decapitating Pritchett.
39) 1) dialog: You can't do this to me!
42) 0) text: Pritchett making a literal last dive for the one window i the foyer that is still partially unsealed, its iron plat closing fast --
42) 1) dialog: 
44) 0) text: Price & Guests entering and greeted by the sight of: Watson Pritchett - Hair wild, clothes torn, SCREAMING as tries to pry the cast-iron plate off the Foyer window wit his bare hands --
44) 1) dialog: 
44) 7) dialog: Lockdown. Sara dashes back in with the bottle of vodka.
44) 9) dialog: A mechanism. From the old Asylum. For Emergencies. Sealed the whole place shut. Top to bottom. That's how come they all burned to death in '31. Dr. Vannacutt threw the switch. If he was gonna die, they all were gonna die, and so they were toast.
44) 11) dialog: The only ones who survived were five of Vannacutt's staff butchers.
44) 13) dialog: It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
44) 15) dialog: I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
44) 18) dialog: Don't know that it does.
44) 20) dialog: Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years. Blackburn, Price and Melissa Marr all chime in unintentio unison:
44) 23) dialog: Won't do any good.
44) 26) dialog: Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
44) 28) dialog: A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
44) 30) dialog: -- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
44) 44) dialog: Believe me, we need to.
44) 46) dialog: The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
44) 48) dialog: You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
44) 50) dialog: It's actually very easy when you know the way.
44) 67) text: Take the gun. Sara takes the pistol from Evelyn, and Pritchett unenthusiastically beckons Eddie and Sara towards a hallw leading to the basement. Price trots towards another door the Salon.
45) 0) text: -- a flurry of crackling SPARKS showers Watson Pritchett he twists the '20's vintage knob light switch. He leaps b with a frightened yelp. We see a brief BURST OF LIGHT from the ancient sconces on walls, revealing a series of moldy, cobwebbed and rubble- strewn basement gallery, and a series of five glass cases filled with the mummified remains of human bodies... One odd human figure rides upon a mummified horse.
49) 0) text: Sara, Eddie and Pritchett continue searching.
49) 2) dialog: I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
49) 8) dialog: (too quickly)
49) 9) text: Nothing. Sara takes the flashlight from Pritchett's hand and aims into the dark hole beyond.
49) 13) dialog: (finally)
49) 16) dialog: Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
49) 18) dialog: Accumulated evil... festering for decades... (switching gears)
49) 21) dialog: Hell NO!! The House will kill ya! Pritchett's oblivious: he's shining his light back down t corridor -- at its terminus it splits into four new corridors.
49) 22) dialog: I think we go down there and take a right. The trio follow Pritchett. WE remain staring at the STEEL DOOR. Almost imperceptibly -- or is it the darkness playi tricks on us? One of the streaks of mold seems to have gr longer.
50) 0) text: Pritchett leading the three others down a new corridor, clearly clueless as to where the hell they are. Shines th flashlight up to find they're in --
51) 1) dialog: Electro-shock therapy. There's several of them hooked together... Dr. Vannacutt liked to zap his patients in multiples of ten. More enerqy-efficient or something. Let's try a left. They turn left. A small, barely noticeable arc of electri zaps from a dangling, half-severed wire.
52) 0) text: Pritchett dead-ended in another room.
52) 1) dialog: Damn-it-all! This is the Saturation Chamber! Left again! He all but yanks Price along with him, Price blurting as disappears from frame:
52) 3) dialog: New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
52) 6) dialog: Left, goddamnit!
53) 0) text: -- to his left. PULL BACK -- And we see, simultaneously, Pritchett, Price and flashlight walking down the corridor that was to thei left -- Eddie and Sara walking down the one that was to their left: a long, snaking passage going in the complete opposite direction.
55) 0) text: Pritchett and Price taking a hard right into --
56) 1) dialog: Bingo! He shines the light through the cavernous space: an immen mechanism of cams, pulleys and counterweights. Price star in absolute awe -- this is something straight out of the Industrial Revolution. He eyes the bank of long-handled, mother-of-pearl tipped levers.
59) 0) text: Pritchett and Price stand in the "Lockdown" control room, staring at a rusted lever that Price has snapped off.
59) 2) dialog: What happened to what's-their-names?
66) 0) text: Pritchett enters the room. The blood-caked Eddie and Sara stumble in, right behind them. Pritchett grimaces...
66) 1) dialog: Now it's marked the two of you.
66) 8) dialog: This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then... (singing)
66) 11) dialog: I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years... (singing)
71) 2) dialog: She's dead. Chalk up one for the House.
74) 0) text: Eddie seen haranguing a near-dead drunk Pritchett:
74) 2) dialog: Yes. Pritchett drains the last drops of his tumbler of Scotch.
74) 3) dialog: Alcoholic coma, if you hurry. He starts to pour another -- -- Eddie swats both glass and bottle out of his hand; the SHATTER on the floor. In this tension-packed room, the so is magnified a hundred-fold. Blackburn all but jumps out his skin.
74) 5) dialog: Oh dear.
75) 26) text: Coming or staying? Eddie looks at his options: Price, Blackburn & Pritchett or Sara.
75) 31) dialog: I think...I may have the answer.
75) 33) dialog: I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere! Pritchett is out of his chair extremely fast for someone a near-lethal blood alcohol level. As he makes his exit, grabs one of the last Glocks. Turns sheepishly to Price:
75) 34) dialog: Nothing personal. He chambers a shell and exits. Beat. Price is alone in th room.
80) 0) text: Pritchett on his hands and knees going through a large cabinet, tossing books and papers over his shoulder in a frenzy of frustration.
80) 2) dialog: (to himself)
83) 0) text: -- Pritchett shrieks as the LIGHTS ZAP BACK ON -- blindin then OFF AGAIN -- then ON --
88) 5) dialog: It's down there! He's pointing to a long corridor - a light strobes at the end.
88) 7) dialog: (awe-struck)
89) 17) dialog: They don't get any deader. Price strokes his wife's hair, tears begin to form in his eyes.
89) 23) dialog: House 2, Guests 0.
89) 44) dialog: I was upstairs looking for... well, uh... moral support. I don't know what's going on down here, but I like you, and if you say the house didn't kill your wife -- Pritchett fumbles out his pistol.
89) 45) dialog: -- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
89) 53) dialog: (suddenly terrified)
89) 77) dialog: What would drive a madman sane would drive a sane man mad. (pauses)
94) 10) dialog: And five that didn't die. Sara and Eddie just about jump out of their skins! Pritchett is standing in the doorway in his usual sloshed condition.
94) 12) dialog: Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
94) 14) dialog: What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
94) 18) dialog: Schechter? Wrong place at the wrong time... like you. Eddie stares at the photo.
96) 4) dialog: Blackburn's dead.
96) 6) dialog: He would have been back by now. Beat. Eddie and Sara look at each other: nahhhh. And then
99) 0) text: The lights have begun strobing again. Sara, Eddie and Pritchett move quickly down corridor after corridor --
101) 3) dialog: You know, that crowbar, that window? Maybe we should just call it a --
101) 5) dialog: Oh, dear.
101) 7) dialog: Oh, dear.
103) 20) dialog: Poor Mr. Price --
103) 26) dialog: Uhhhh...
103) 28) dialog: Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.

108) 4) dialog: He must've unsealed the room!
109) 1) dialog: Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
109) 7) dialog: In the attic? The WALL at the end of the corridor is bending and twisti taking on a new, hideous shape.
109) 9) dialog: Me? You've gotta be kidding. The SHADOW THING rounds the bend at the end of the corrid it's enveloped the entire CEILING. Pritchett looks at Sara and Eddie plaintively --
119) 0) text: Pritchett finds himself in the cavernous attic, standing before the massive pulley and counterweight system that's upper half of the lockdown mechanism. Through the grooved channel that one of the iron plates slides up and down on, Pritchett can look down and see th Foyer and the plate blocking the front door. There's a hand crank attached to a series of block-and- tackles that ultimately connect to the massive counterwei to the front door's plate. With all his effort, he turns the crank, but can only man a half revolution -- -- creak-crunch -- but something moved down there! You ca hear it! How much, how high, he can't see, but maybe it's enough.
119) 1) dialog: If there is a God... He puts his full weight behind him and grabs the crank ag -- pushes down -- and the thing breaks off in his hand.
119) 2) dialog: No-no-no!!!! Why me, why me, you sonovabitch! In hysterical frustration, he throws the broken flange of metal as hard as he can at the wall. He misses the wall entirely and the crank just pinballs impotently between cables and counter-weights with a series of mocking CLANK and PINGS!
119) 3) dialog: Whyyyyyyy?????? As he tears at his hair, screeching, suddenly he notices light on his hands. He turns, and the: DIM GLOW from a soon-to-rise sun falls on his face. He SE that, somehow, all that caroming that his errant crank di has caused one of the IRON PLATES to raise slightly. Ther now a THREE FOOT OPENING in the attic dormer window. PRITCHETT'S EYES glance nervously upward.
119) 4) dialog: Is it too late to take back a couple of things I said?
121) 0) text: Pritchett moves to the window and freedom. He is about to make it outside when he stops.
121) 1) dialog: Oh, c'mon -- don't grow a conscience now, f'chrissake! He continues out the window -- stops again. Looks heavenw angry and guilty at the same time. Yells to his deity:
121) 2) dialog: Alright, alright! I won't leave 'em here to die! He crabs himself back into the attic, runs over to the grooved channel that the front door's iron plate slides o Shouts down through the slit to the Foyer:
121) 3) dialog: I found the way out!
122) 1) dialog: Anybody still alive? I'm giving you ten seconds! Two-four-six-eight -- Sara and Eddie dash into the Foyer.
122) 3) dialog: (slightly disappointed)
122) 6) dialog: Up here --
123) 0) text: A metallic POP! and PING! is heard. Pritchett's eyes dart the machinery: a strand of the rusted cable holding the window open has snapped free, and the rest are in an adva state of fray.
123) 1) dialog: -- I think you better hurry -- there's something of a time issue here.
125) 3) dialog: Over here! The attic is a labyrinth of dangling cables, counterweigh and their often neck-high metal moorings. Sara moves towa the sound of his voice, Eddie hangs back, sensing somethi SARA slowly wends her way through all the mishigas. UNSEEN by her, down by her carefully treading feet, the Shadow Mass is filtering up through the slits in the atti floor. SARA edges her way around a tall iron fly-rail -- -- and something grabs at her hand. She's had enough, she reaches back to slug it -- then stops: It's Pritchett.
125) 4) dialog: Please. It's been a bad enough day -- -- and now the SHADOW MASS has re-assembled to its new, f enormity. It begins to barrel across the attic towards Pritchett and Sara, who don't have a clue -- Eddie does..
125) 7) dialog: I'm just the contractor's son! I had nothing to do with your current condition! The words seem to have little impact on the steadily approaching Mass of Faces. -- and then suddenly SUNLIGHT POURS in behind him.

They're both missing shoes. They shrug. The sunliqht warms their faces.
