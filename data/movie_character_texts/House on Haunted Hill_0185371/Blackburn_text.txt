29) 2) dialog: If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
29) 14) dialog: Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
30) 4) dialog: More to the point. Where's our host?
30) 6) dialog: More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
30) 9) dialog: I'm moved beyond words.
30) 12) dialog: Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
30) 34) text: I can't remember at the moment. Blackburn applies his handkerchief to Evelyn's bleeding cheek. She recoils:
30) 50) dialog: I'm surrounded by idiots. Blackburn walks off into the Main Salon near the Foyer. T others shrug and follow him, except for Pritchett, who sh upstairs:
33) 9) dialog: What are you playing here, Price?
33) 17) dialog: Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
33) 26) dialog: I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
43) 3) dialog: If this is someone's idea of a joke -- -- an agonized SCREAM in response; it's coming from the Foyer --
44) 5) dialog: Bottle of vodka on the sideboard: get it! She races into the other room. Blackburn takes his handkerchief and puts it on Pritchett's wounds. Pritchett doesn't so much as whimper, keeps staring at Price. In a daze:
44) 12) dialog: Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
44) 16) dialog: Oh, for chrissake --
44) 21) dialog: I've got my cellular.
44) 35) dialog: If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
48) 0) text: Evelyn, a huge drink in her hand, holding forth to a not terribly interested Dr. Blackburn. Melissa Marr's oblivio Camcorder to her eye, slowly dollying herself out of the room.
48) 2) dialog: Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
48) 4) dialog: I'm confused.
66) 13) dialog: There must be some other way out.
72) 0) text: Price and Blackburn striding down a long hallway, eyes darting everywhere, shouting:
72) 2) dialog: Ms. Marr! And then hearing from down in the basement:
73) 0) text: Price and Blackburn arrive to see Eddie and Sara standing outside the door labeled "Cerebral Hygiene."
73) 2) dialog: Is she alright?
73) 4) dialog: Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
73) 7) dialog: It just...stops here. Sara sticks her head in the door, nervously:
74) 4) dialog: Jesus H. Christ!
74) 6) dialog: (to Eddie)
74) 14) dialog: Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
75) 17) dialog: Three times, to be exact.
75) 19) dialog: Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
75) 26) text: Coming or staying? Eddie looks at his options: Price, Blackburn & Pritchett or Sara.
75) 28) dialog: Yeah, me too. Blackburn takes a gun from the coffin and cocks it.
75) 30) dialog: No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him. He glares at Price and exits in the opposite direction. Long beat. Price stares at the befuddled Pritchett who se to be having a quiet conversation with himself.
78) 0) text: Dr. Blackburn, armed with Sara's flashlight and his medic bag, strides with determination through the labyrinth. Th stops when he hears a faint VOICE in the distance:
78) 2) dialog: (suddenly nervous)
84) 0) text: -- the lights in the wall sconces are strobing like an epileptic's worst nightmare. The sheer schizo-psychedelia it all has Dr. Blackburn frozen in his tracks --
86) 0) text: -- likewise Dr. Blackburn --
88) 0) text: Price spies Blackburn at the other end of a Corridor, sho over the Noise to him:
88) 2) dialog: I don't know!! Sara and Eddie appear, spot them; Sara shouts:
88) 9) dialog: What are you babbling, you lunatic?? And then clarity comes to Price's eyes.
89) 2) dialog: Don't move, don't make a sound... In the darkness, in the distance, they can make out AN ANIMATE PRESENCE at waist level. Pale. With something flowing from its sides, almost wing-like. And it's squirming, undulating like a snake -- and then, softly this time, that calf-like cry. High-pitched, almost femal sounding. Price ducks under Blackburn's arm and starts walking slow into the room, towards it. No one tries to stop him. ON PRICE as he gets closer, and can see that whatever it is, it's perched atop one of the TABLES -- -- the CRY -- and Price steps closer, and he can make out to the side of the table, something that looks like....a hand? -- the CRY -- closer now: a hand discerned -- human -- wi rings on the fingers, polish on the nails --
89) 7) dialog: -- are you crazy!?! -- and for a moment all anyone can do is watch as Evelyn gets jolted and slammed again and again and again -- and sparks fly from the electrodes on her head and smoke star to billow --
89) 9) dialog: I'm sorry --
89) 14) dialog: -- even it we were in the E.R., Price: it's too late -- her heart's burst! Price puts his ear on Evelyn's chest -- listens -- his fa falls.
89) 21) dialog: She's right, Price. It's a matter for the police. He takes Price's hands firmly and removes them from Evely
89) 31) dialog: -- what was he doing here?
89) 37) dialog: -- which is why you killed her. And now he takes his pistol and cocks it at Price.
89) 40) dialog: -- I did: down here.
89) 51) dialog: Oh, really: who?
89) 60) dialog: If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
89) 75) dialog: Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
90) 0) text: Price lets out a scream as Eddie SLAMS the door to the "Saturation Chamber". Price's face appears in the small porthole. Sara twists the WHEEL that seals tight the cast-iron, cap shaped device. Asks Blackburn:
90) 2) dialog: Don't think it'll be a problem.
90) 6) dialog: I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
90) 8) dialog: I'm not worried. Sara nods, takes Eddie's hand and disappears up the stair Blackburn and Price stare at each other on opposite sides the tiny window. Price is screeching something at him, bu can't hear a word through all that iron.
90) 9) dialog: Can't quite make that out -- what? Price silently bellows.
90) 10) dialog: You want to see how this thing works? Weird request, but okay... Blackburn leans over and starts twisting dials and flippi every switch he can find on the CONTROL PANEL of the caps We see Price look up in alarm: a CIRCLE OF PULSING LIGHTS dappling down on him. It looks almost quaint: like a Victorian carousel at night.
90) 11) dialog: You've got to let me know how it all turns out. Professional courtesy and all that. And with Price seen yelling and pounding through the wind BLACKBURN walks away and disappears into the dark of the basement. He passes right by the huge, sealed STEEL DOOR where Vannacutt stashed his corpses. The tendrils of mold the metal have expanded to the length of a man's arm.
95) 0) text: Dr. Blackburn opens the door to the room and walks grimly into it, staring at Evelyn's dead body, still strapped to table.
95) 1) dialog: The late Mrs. Steven Price. From his medical-bag, he removes a scalpel.
95) 2) dialog: Tragic, tortured Mrs. Steven Price. With a blur of quick slashes, he cuts her limbs and torso free of their moldy restraints.
95) 3) dialog: Lovely Mrs. Steven Price. Now accessible, he parts the top of her nightgown. Runs a finger slowwwwly from the tip of her chin down to her bar breasts.
95) 4) dialog: Creamy, cool...and now very cooperative Mrs. Steven Price. His tongue darts from his lips and he begins planting lon lingering kisses all over her neck -- -- FLASH: of a hypodermic being pulled from Blackburn's b -- Blackburn kissing everywhere around her breasts -- -- FLASH: of the air bubbles in the needle being plunged of the tip: squirt! -- -- bubbles of Blackburn's saliva dampening her nipples, h tongue swabbing concentric circles within her aureole -- -- FLASH: the needle into the crook of Evelyn's elbow -- -- Blackburn's mouth dancing down to her belly -- he's be to hyperventilate with excitement -- and A HAND comes languidly into frame, begins stroking his lu dyed locks --
95) 6) dialog: I've missed this. And Dr. Blackburn tosses the hypo away and hoists himself meet the eager, waiting mouth of the now very alive EVELY STOCKARD-PRICE -- who starts to vigorously respond to Blackburn's touch. He reluctantly pulls himself away.
95) 7) dialog: Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
95) 9) dialog: Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
95) 11) dialog: Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
95) 13) dialog: "But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
95) 15) dialog: -- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
95) 17) dialog: It's complicated. But don't worry --
95) 19) dialog: Not yet.
95) 21) dialog: -- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
95) 23) dialog: -- bullshit --
95) 25) dialog: It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
95) 27) dialog: How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
95) 29) dialog: And how the hell are we going to do that?
