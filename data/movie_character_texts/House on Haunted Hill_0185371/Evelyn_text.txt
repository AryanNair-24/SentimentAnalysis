32) 0) text: As Evelyn slams the door behind her.
32) 1) dialog: I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
32) 3) dialog: I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
32) 5) dialog: Then who are they?
32) 7) dialog: What are you talking about? You think I invited them?

44) 39) dialog: Really? Well, let it rip.
44) 41) dialog: -- the sadistic prick --
44) 51) dialog: A word of advice, honey? God knows what kind of freak-outs Steven's got set to spring in this place. If I were you, I'd bring something to protect yourself with. Baby, don't you think now's the time to I break out your "party favors?" Price suddenly looks uneasy.

75) 1) dialog: Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
75) 3) dialog: I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
75) 5) dialog: -- and who's next on your list?

95) 24) dialog: -- the whole thing is falling apart! Blackburn starts stroking her, trying to calm her.
