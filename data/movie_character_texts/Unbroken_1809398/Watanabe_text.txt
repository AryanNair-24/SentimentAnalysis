Omori POW Camp sits on a man-made island in Tokyo Bay: a sandy spit connected to shore by a tenuous thread of bamb slats, surrounded by six fences. Ashen and gray earth. Louie approaches oversized wooden gates into the Omori compound. Grim, lifeless, like the surface of the moon. Louie and the other newly arrived POWs are lined up with current prisoners, emerging threadbare from their barrack for roll call, in front of a small office building. The stand by a “quarantine shed” - a corrugated carport, roo without walls, completely open to the elements. The men a ordered to stand at attention, in Japanese, by the Guards A bark from a Japanese guard. The men stiffen. 79 The door of the office barracks swings open. MUTUSHIRO WATANABE aka THE BIRD: a distant figure, too fa away to distinguish his features. He is in an enlisted ma uniform: little cap, khaki_green uniform. He steps out_on the porch, a kendo stick clasped behind his back. He look slowly across the men assembled before him.
101) 1) dialog: Good evening, old prisoners. Welcome, new hands. This is Omori Detention camp. He steps slowly down off the porch. Watanabe takes a stroll down the row of men. Lateral tracks over him as he walks along the front row o prisoners. All the men are looking down, taking care not to meet Watanabe’s eye as he passes.

He speaks with a strong, confident voice. He clearly is v well educated.
