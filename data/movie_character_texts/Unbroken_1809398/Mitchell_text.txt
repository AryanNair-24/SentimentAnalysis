The top turret gunner: STANLEY PILLSBURY. He looks out: his view to one side, of the accompanying planes on his wing, pans forward, over his own plane’s cockpit and nose, to the ocean before us.

Mitchell’s bullets hit the Zero. Louie grabs a photo taped to the now-broken glass and jam it in his pocket. (We will later know the importance of t picture) He grumbles as he starts crawling out of the bel Louie crawls out from his position into the center of the plane. Mac is firing at two Zeros. Harry is firing at another. Stanley is firing at a couple more. Suddenly- CRACK. A bullet hole opens in the bubble just behind his head. He turns. A Zero is on his other side bearing in on him at 45 degre guns firing. Much firing, inside and out. Bullets chink through the me of the plane. Stanley keeps firing. Below him, as he’s kneeling he sees Zeros through the ope bomb bay doors. More bullets pierce the plane. Bullets fl from the plane. We see the Belly Gunner in the suspended bubble in a fire fight with a Zero. Bullets pierce the bubble. 5-6 Louie grabs the medical bag and climbs across the catwalk get to the Belly Gunner. More gunfire. Harry fires laterally. BOOM!— a cannon roun strikes nearby and the concussion slams his head against wall. His goggles shatter. He reaches up to take off the goggles.

As he stabilizes Harry and administers morphine, Louie notices Mac at the tail gun shooting down a Zero. He also sees Douglass-- leg shot and bloody but he stands strong shoots back. Louie straps Harry down and makes his way back to the fro of the plane. BAM!— a very big explosion— a hole rips open in the side the plane.

Stanley, in the top bubble, looks intently out, hands ten on Gans o ready for a target to appear. One of his legs i shredded. He keeps shooting, not missing a beat. In the rectangle of exterior view a Zero enters from aft, climbing. 10 Pillsbury bangs the high speed rotator of his turret. The turret grunts to life, whirling Pillsbury around ninety degrees. The Zero reaches the top of it’s arc, leveling o and speeds directly towards Superman. Pillsbury can see the pilot who could end his life. Pills sucks ina sharp | breath and fires. He watches the tracer skim away from his guns muzzle and punch through the cock of the Zero. The windshield blows apart and the pilot pit forward. The Zero folds onto itself like a wounded bird. All quiet, except for wind whistling through all the different-sized holes punched all over our aircraft. Suddenly, the last Zero comes up from below, the sound of fire, and the Zero falters and falls. Clarence Douglas, standing at the waist gun with his thigh, chest, and shou torn open, brings it down.
