The car SMASHES through the front of the house in a storm glass and rubble. The airbag HITS Cole full on as- Bee goes flying as the SUV tears through the room- Before coming to a stop. Debris falls from the ceiling as- Cole coughs. His whole body hurts. He pushes the airbag away and tries to look out the windo It’s hard to see anything. Gingerly, he opens the door and falls out of the SUV.
