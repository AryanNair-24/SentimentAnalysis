1) 0) text: Dave staggers down the hall, his hair white with baby pow his face covered in poo, and a twin in each arm SCREAMING into each of his ears. He soldiers on, stoic, an unsung hero in his time...

5) 0) text: Dave enters his modest office; his phone is RINGING.
5) 2) dialog: Gladys, I'm a grown man, okay? He angrily punches "SPEAKER" on his RINGING phone as he reties his tie with a more traditional knot.
5) 3) dialog: Lockwood. A shrill, horribly impersonated British accent fills Dave office -- as well as all of the surrounding offices.
5) 7) dialog: Jesus, Mitch, I'm at work--
5) 17) dialog: Dude, how stoned are you?
5) 20) dialog: Come on, it's 10 in the morning.

7) 15) dialog: Oh, I'm sorry, sugar-bug... Dave looks genuinely concerned. Cara just shrugs and keep reading her butterfly book. Jamie whispers to him:
7) 17) dialog: Right, of course. Jamie finally notices Dave's foam-covered face, and softe

8) 12) dialog: Nice. What movie?
8) 14) dialog: Sounds cool.
8) 16) dialog: I hope you get it, man.

9) 7) dialog: (toasting his beer)
9) 11) dialog: OH! So finish your story! The girl calls you up...?
9) 13) dialog: What's her name?
9) 15) dialog: Incredible. What's her last name? Mitch just looks at him.
9) 22) dialog: Is she hot? She is, right? Oh my God I already have a boner!
9) 25) dialog: NO! Keep going! I need these stories, man! They're all I have. Mitch registers the desperation in his married friend's e
9) 27) dialog: Oh my God how big?
9) 29) dialog: Oh my God she sounds like Sabrina.
9) 31) dialog: This hot paralegal in my office.
9) 33) dialog: What's a Cancer List?
9) 40) dialog: That's sick, man. Jamie is the mother of my children...
9) 43) dialog: Just finish your story, man! I'm dying over here!
9) 47) dialog: I don't even know what those are!
9) 56) dialog: That is maybe the single greatest story I've ever heard in my life.
9) 58) dialog: I don't know why...I don't know why I've always been in such a rush, you know?
9) 62) dialog: You remember me in high school, I was always so focussed on getting into a good college, then when I got to college, I was so focussed on getting into a good law school, then in law school I was just trying to land a job at a good firm, then Jamie and I got married and we had Cara right away-- I just feel like and I missed out on all the fun stuff, you know? The sex, the drugs, the bad choices, and now it's too late. I blew it. I pissed away my 20's, and now I'm staring down the barrel a seriously boring life.
9) 64) dialog: No, I know--
9) 71) dialog: Wait, what?
10) 1) dialog: Don't get me wrong, I love my kids, I do, I would take a bullet for them, but...remember that heroin addict you dated?
10) 3) dialog: Jesus, how many heroin addicts have you dated?
10) 5) dialog: Anyway. Having kids is like dating a heroin addict, only instead of dating them, they move into your house for 18 years. They're laughing one second and crying the next and then they're trying to kill themselves in your bathroom for no reason. They're mean and selfish and they burn through all your money and they steal your shit and they break everything and they stay up all night and they listen to really shitty music and the dirty secret is, no one actually likes kids.
10) 12) dialog: No! It's true. Everyone pretends to like kids because if you don't you look like a huge dick. It's like Drew Barrymore or jazz. No one actually likes them, but if you say that out loud, everybody hates you.
10) 14) dialog: I'm just saying: don't fuck up your life like I did, okay?
10) 17) dialog: Wait, what--?
10) 24) dialog: Tatiana! I want Tatiana! I want sex with strange new women and maybe also with Sabrina if she's single and I want to wake up at noon and smoke weed all afternoon and I want to not think about the needs of four other people 24 hours a day and I want to start reading a novel and actually finish it and I want to take a solid shit because I'm not constantly stressed out and I want to learn how to rollerblade and also I really want to pee...
10) 27) dialog: Bingo. They stumble over to the fountain, unzip their pants, and leaning on each other, begin peeing into it. Mitch glance at the GREEK GODDESS METIS. She scowls down at them.
10) 29) dialog: Maybe she has three kids and a job she hates.
10) 31) dialog: I'm just saying...I envy your life.
10) 33) dialog: Yeah you don't--
10) 40) dialog: No, I do--!
10) 41) dialog: I wish I had your life! I wish I had your life! They're about to say "jinx" when--
10) 46) dialog: R-Rolling blackout?
10) 48) dialog: You really have nice flow by the way. Very thick and confident.
10) 50) dialog: Thank you. My urologist says I run a little warm. Eventually they both finish, tuck in, and zip up. Beat.

12) 7) dialog: Fine, Jesus, relax-- Dave opens the door to see himself standing there.

12) 10) dialog: 
12) 17) dialog: Oh my God...
12) 19) dialog: I'm a fucking loser...
12) 21) dialog: How the fuck did this happen?!
12) 23) dialog: What, switching bodies with another human being?! Oh yeah, this shit happens to me like twice a week!
12) 25) dialog: Oh, you don't want to be me?! No, no, no: I don't want to be you!
12) 27) dialog: Look, let's just.. .think. How could this have possibly happened...? They pace about the apartment, trying to think... Then:
12) 30) dialog: Not dreaming.
12) 37) dialog: Wait, what'd you just say?
12) 39) dialog: (running out the door) Come on!
13) 0) text: Dave speeds through morning traffic in his Audi station wagon, leaning on the HORN. Mitch sits shotgun, confused.
13) 1) dialog: Remember last night when we peed into that fountain?! As we peed, we wished we had each other's lives!
13) 4) dialog: Our wishes must've... somehow... come true.
13) 6) dialog: Well apparently urine works too.
14) 0) text: Unable to find a parking spot, Mitch and Dave double-park Hollywood Boulevard, hop out, and sprint for the plaza...

14) 14) dialog: Where did you take it?!
14) 16) dialog: Who could tell us where it is?!
14) 27) dialog: When will it be in the computer?!

15) 13) dialog: Marty Green, the producer of Busted Dreams 4. Apparently the guy they cast for Steve Action OD'd last night, and the back-up actor got deported, so, alphabetically, you're the next actor on the list. You got the part, man. Mitch covers his mouth like he just won American Idol.
15) 16) dialog: (remembering, stunned) Oh my God: and I've got my closing today.
15) 18) dialog: A big--?! Yeah! Whether or not I make partner is riding on this!
15) 20) dialog: No. No. We can't just be each other for a day, Mitch! You have no idea how to be a lawyer!
15) 27) dialog: First of all, it's Busted Dreams 4, okay? It's not The Reader. Second of all, I'm a WASP, I've spent my entire life acting happy and no one has ever questioned my performance, okay?! They look at each other, cooling off a bit...
15) 28) dialog: Are...Are we actually considering doing this...?
15) 30) dialog: All right, well, my meeting starts in 45 minutes. You need to race home, get dressed, then go to my office and find my secretary Gladys-
15) 32) dialog: No. Get the merger docs from Gladys and take them to the conference room. All the partners will be there so do not speak to anyone.
15) 34) dialog: NO! No vamping! And once the meeting starts, you will continue to say nothing. When a partner asks you for the merger documents, you will silently hand them over, okay?
15) 41) dialog: No! Play it small. Really small. I've spent the last nine months banging out the terms of this deal, all you have to do is hand over the documents. That's it.
15) 44) dialog: I'm trusting you, too...
15) 46) dialog: Oh hey, you also need to pick up Cara from ballet at 4, okay?
16) 0) text: Mitch blows into Dave's stodgy law firm looking like a la -- from a Ralph Lauren ad: he sports a pink buttondown, r suspenders, a blue crested blazer, khakis, no socks, blac and white wingtips, and slicked-back hair. He also affects a preposterous patrician accent like John Kerry or any white guy on a black sitcom.
18) 0) text: Dave nervously pulls up to a RANCH HOUSE in the Fiero, reading the address off his iPhone. Several crew trucks a parked out front, and PA's with headsets loiter about. Dave gets out wearing an ironed buttondown shirt tucked i khakis. He self-consciously untucks half his shirt, tryin look "cooler," as he approaches a nearby P.A.
18) 1) dialog: Yo, Mitch Planko is here. Where the fuck is Hair &amp; Makeup? P.A.
18) 3) dialog: That's so real. Dave stiffly walks off as the P.A. eyes him, weirded out. INT. HAIR &amp; MAKEUP TRAILER -- DAY Dave, now in leather pants, the top four buttons of his s undone, sits in the makeup chair, getting his hair styled studies the script, confused. Then a P.A. hurries in.
18) 10) dialog: No thanks. Hey, what does it mean when it says T.S., or B.T.S.? P.A. Titty Shot and Bouncing Titty Shot.
18) 13) dialog: Wait! W-what kind of movie is this?! P.A. It's a lorno.
18) 14) dialog: I-I'm not familiar with that genre. P.A. Lorno? Light porno? Tits &amp; shadows? You ever hear of Skinemax?
18) 15) dialog: Oh no. They arrive in

18) 41) dialog: Is this actually happening?
18) 52) dialog: If you let me don't in...don't let me in...If you don't let me in, Paco, I will fuck you dead. That doesn't sound right. If you don't let me Taco-- is his name Paco or Taco? Your penmanship is illegible--
18) 54) dialog: Oh my goodness it is Lola my long lost lover Lola who...I love. Her.
18) 56) dialog: 
18) 61) dialog: I'm sorry! I can't!
18) 70) dialog: Look, I can't, I'm married.
18) 72) dialog: No, I mean, me, in real life. I'm married.
19) 22) dialog: I dry-humped a stranger's leg for three hours today... Sitting opposite him, Mitch downs a shot, exhausted.
19) 24) dialog: Oh no -- what happened at work?
19) 26) dialog: Oh my God tell me you're kidding.
19) 28) dialog: What. 1
19) 36) dialog: 
20) 0) text: Dave and Mitch head up Dave's front walk, solemn...
20) 2) dialog: The truth.
21) 0) text: Mitch and Dave enter to find Cara running down the stairs her Dora the Explorer pajamas. Dave smiles and opens his arms, tired and overjoyed to see her...
21) 1) dialog: Hey, sugar-bug. .but she passes right by him and hugs Mitch.
21) 4) dialog: Okay, I don't sound like that-- Just then Jamie hurries past, the twins in her arms, and kisses Mitch on the lips. Both men startle a bit.
21) 12) dialog: This is so weird.
21) 15) dialog: Right -- no, thank you. I'm-- Look, Jamie, we really need to talk.
21) 17) dialog: I. .um...I'm not Mitch.
21) 20) dialog: Then the city moved the fountain--
21) 29) dialog: Baby, please don't--
21) 31) dialog: Look, I can prove it's true! Just, I don't know, just ask me anything that only I -- that only Dave -- would know. Anything.
21) 33) dialog: Spring?
21) 36) dialog: Why do you know that?
21) 38) dialog: Look, just ask me anything else.
21) 42) dialog: You have a favorite color?
21) 49) dialog: Dude: do you not understand what we're trying to accomplish here?!
21) 51) dialog: Baby -- Jamie -- ask me anything else, something more personal...
21) 53) dialog: (taking a stab in the dark) Yourrrrr mother maybe?
21) 56) dialog: I have a lot on my plate right now, man! You have no idea!
21) 58) dialog: Are you joking? You worked at my job for one day and you almost got arrested! What are you gonna do to my family?!
21) 67) dialog: What do you tell Jamie.. .when?
21) 69) dialog: But it's Tuesday.
21) 71) dialog: That's adorable. Dave turns and exits the house, still LAUGHING...

23) 1) dialog: Jesus, it's like a Swedish asylum--
23) 7) dialog: Mitch Planko, who the fuck is this? A sexy woman's voice purrs:
23) 9) dialog: Tatiana?! Hi! How, um, how are you?
23) 11) dialog: Oh my God. Oh my God. He quickly dials a number.
23) 14) dialog: Tatiana is on her way over!
23) 16) dialog: What do you think I should do?!
23) 24) dialog: But wouldn't I be...sort of... cheating on Jamie? Maybe?
23) 26) dialog: But my mind is over here, doesn't that count... somehow?
23) 28) dialog: Millions.
23) 30) dialog: Your reasoning is oddly impeccable.
23) 32) dialog: Jesus ...I haven't had sex with another woman since college...
23) 34) dialog: Oh my God so am I--. There's a KNOCK at the apartment door. Dave jumps, freake
23) 40) dialog: Holy shit she's already here! What do I do?!
23) 42) dialog: (freezing, breathless) Tatiana...
23) 44) dialog: I-I honestly don't know... She throws off her trenchcoat to reveal she's not wearing anything underneath. Awesome. Less awesome is the fact that she's NINE MONTHS PREGNANT. Massive breasts sit atop a huge, distended, veiny, protru stomach. Dave recoils.
23) 45) dialog: 
23) 48) dialog: But you're--?! When are you due?!
23) 50) dialog: Oh god gross! Wait, who's the father? Am I the father?!

23) 68) dialog: Well...now that you mention it? Maybe, like, a little?
23) 70) dialog: 
23) 77) dialog: Look, Tatiana, I'm sorry. You're incredibly beautiful, it's just--
23) 79) dialog: Oh my god I can see it kicking. You can, in fact, see the fetus moving around in her bell
26) 1) dialog: in Mitch's apartment, jacking off to some (very small) internet porn on Mitch's iPhone. Then the porn disappears and "DAVE LOCKWOOD CALLING" appears on screen.
26) 2) dialog: Oh come on... (answering, panting) What?
26) 4) dialog: What? No!
26) 6) dialog: Look, I had to, I never get this kind of privacy anymore.
26) 13) dialog: Yeah. I guess. Is that weird?
26) 15) dialog: It sort of hooks to the side a bit.
26) 17) dialog: Cool, thanks. Hey, how long have you been shaved down there?
26) 19) dialog: Really?
26) 21) dialog: Yeeeah, Tatiana might not be coming back. Like, ever.
26) 23) dialog: Me?! She's nine months pregnant!
26) 25) dialog: I could see the baby kicking, dude!
26) 32) dialog: Relax, Mitch--
26) 34) dialog: Jesus, okay, I'm sorry...
26) 36) dialog: Look, is there a reason you're calling me at 3 in the morning? Mitch glares back to the twins, who are still WAILING.
26) 38) dialog: Have you changed their diapers already?
26) 45) dialog: Okay, take them to the kitchen.
27) 2) dialog: Go to the fridge... Mitch turns away from the twins and opens the fridge. He a bottle of wine and immediately drinks from the bottle.
27) 4) dialog: Defrost two bags of breastmilk in the microwave for 3 minutes, then prepare two separate bottles... Mitch grabs a container of cow's milk, sniffs it, turns t give it to the babies -- to discover that Sarah is gone, Peter is licking an ELECTRICAL SOCKET!
27) 6) dialog: What was that?
27) 13) dialog: First: attach the filter to the seal to the nipple... Mitch hears CLINK CLINK and spins to see that Sarah has crawled over to the KNIFE BLOCK and removed a BUTCHER KNI and a MEAT CLEAVER and is waving them about like rattles!
27) 16) dialog: I know, right? And make sure you don't allow any air bubbles in. Mitch grabs a pair of tongs and, after a few attempts, snatches the butcher knife from Sarah's hands. Then he sc her up and deposits her into the sink with her brother. Finally, he slumps over, trying to catch his breath.
27) 27) dialog: Great. So where's the fountain?
27) 29) dialog: WHAT? How long can it possibly take you to find your own fountain?!
27) 31) dialog: Thanks, Carla, you just ruined my life. Have an awesome day. Dave blows out of there, choking on his fury...

28) 1) dialog: Real bad news--! Jamie startles and quickly dries her eyes.
28) 3) dialog: Are you okay...? Dave enters, concerned, and instinctively starts helping dress the babies. She watches him, a bit confused.
28) 9) dialog: Come on, you can tell me. We've been friends forever...
28) 12) dialog: Oh my god I'm going to fucking kill him.
28) 14) dialog: No. Jamie. I swear he's not. You're just going through a very temporary rough patch, okay?
28) 16) dialog: (this is news to him) Y-You have?!
28) 18) dialog: No I really do. Tell me everything. Jamie looks at him, sees the urgency in his eyes. Frowns.
28) 27) dialog: well poor Jamie! You have an ambitious, hard-working husband who provides for you and your family -- how can you even stand it?
29) 0) text: Mitch shaves in the bathroom as Dave paces, anxious.
29) 7) dialog: It means we might be in each other's bodies for a while...
29) 9) dialog: My life sucks?! You drive a Fiero-- Jamie calls through the door:
29) 11) dialog: All right, angel! Have a nice day!
29) 15) dialog: Listen to me: I know I complain about my family sometimes, but Jamie and the kids are everything to me... My marriage is falling apart, my job is on the line, and I need you to step up and be the best possible version of me, okay?
29) 17) dialog: Well. Then I'm just gonna have to teach you. Let's start at the
30) 0) text: Dave holds up a suit from his closet. Mitch watches.
30) 1) dialog: This is called a suit. You have to wear one every day, along with-- (holding up tie)

31) 0) text: Mitch, highly uncomfortable in his business suit, scowls Dave shows him the kids' schedules on the fridge.
31) 1) dialog: This is called a schedule. It tells you everything you need to do in a given day. Drop offs. Pick ups. Activities. Playdates. Doctors appointments. You'll notice that there are approximately 50 hours worth of obligations on any given day. Find a way.
32) 0) text: Dave drives. Mitch slumps in the passenger seat, grumpy.
32) 1) dialog: Always be thinking of your next responsibility. It helps to break your day into four minute increments. And remember: there is no margin for error.
32) 8) dialog: If you pick up the twins, the drycleaning and the diaper cream but forget the organic quince paste from that little place on Abbot Kinney, everyone still hates you. You have to be perfect.
33) 0) text: Dave walks Mitch through Whole Foods with a cart, selecti various items from the list.
33) 1) dialog: This is called a grocery store. You buy food here. Before heading to the market, always call Jamie first and ask her if she needs anything. In fact, before you make anV decisions in your life, no matter how small, call your wife first. Think of yourself as a retarded mule lost in the desert: helpless, dumb, and in constant need of direction. Never take initiative, never strike out on your own, never deviate from the plan: you are always wrong. You are a retarded mule lost in the desert.
34) 1) dialog: When you're with Jamie, you should always be doing one of three things: asking her permission, complimenting her, or begging her forgiveness. It doesn't matter if she already said you could go to poker night, or if she looks like fucking Mothra in that dress, or if you didn't do anything wrong. Permission, compliments, apologies.
