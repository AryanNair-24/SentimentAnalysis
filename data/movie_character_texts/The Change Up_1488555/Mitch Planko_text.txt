5) 19) dialog: I'm pretty stoned.
5) 21) dialog: Dude, guess what? Great news.
5) 23) dialog: I found a futon on the street.
5) 25) dialog: I sort of had to fight a bum for it -- is that bad?
5) 27) dialog: Are you gonna bitch out on tonight? You are, aren't you. Dave, half-listening, sits at his desk and answers emails
5) 28) dialog: Dodgers-Giants, dude! We haven't missed one of these in like 20 years! Don't be a vajeen!
5) 35) dialog: You always do this! You never make time for your friends anymore and I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but people are starting to talk. Feelings are getting hurt.
5) 37) dialog: Not mine, because, like a samurai, I have trained myself to feel nothing except revenge and honor, but other people -- nameless, other, more sensitive people -- are hurt, and they think you need to treasure your friendships a little bit more. (exhaling massive bong rip) How concerned should I be that my new futon smells like death?
5) 39) dialog: If you bail I will rape you.
5) 41) dialog: In your eye. I will eye-rape you.
5) 44) dialog: Shit. Mitch starts waving away the pot smoke.
5) 45) dialog: Gotta go, pick you up at six--!
5) 51) dialog: One sec, Dad! The smoke clears and Mitch jogs to the door and opens it reveal his father, MITCH, SR., 60's, friendly, in a suit, holding a pile of mail. MITCH, SR. Hey, buddy! Your mailbox was spilling over.
5) 52) dialog: Oh thanks, I always forget. They hug, and Mitch takes the mail and, without looking a it, chucks it onto a HUGE PILE OF OLD MAIL in the corner. MITCH, SR. Were you smoking marijuana in here?
5) 53) dialog: No! Honestly, it's my new futon, it smells like illegal drugs. MITCH, SR. We've talked about this, Mitch. Smoke your grass on the balcony, okay? It's just hard for me to tell the other tenants they can't smoke in their units when my own son is blazing away in his, you know?
5) 54) dialog: You got it, Dad. MITCH, SR. Oh hey, I saw your commercial on channel 9 again last night...
5) 55) dialog: Which one? "Give Gonorrhea The Boot" or "Samir's Pet Shack Our Low Low Prices Are Snake-sational?" MITCH, SR. Samir's Pet Shack. It's just a shame you can't see your face in that giant ape costume.
5) 61) dialog: Actually, the real shame is that Samir paid me in fucking organic bird seed, but whatever... He glares at several crates of BIRD SEED by the door. MITCH, SR. Well, your mother would've liked it. She always loved animals...
5) 63) dialog: I'm a little tight, actually, Pops. Especially vis a vis, you know, the whole bird seed situation. MITCH, SR. Five hundred?
5) 64) dialog: Can you make it a grand? Mitch's dad smiles to hide his disappointment and hands h 30-year-old son a roll of hundred dollar bills. MITCH, SR. You thought any more about coming to work for me?
5) 65) dialog: Yeeeah...I'm not really sure I'm a "work" guy, you know what I mean? Plus, I've been getting a ton of auditions recently, so... MITCH, SR. Okay, well, my door is always open.
5) 66) dialog: Thanks, pop. Bones. Mitch, Sr. smiles and awkwardly bumps his son's fist.
5) 67) dialog: Batting cages next weekend? MITCH, SR. Great! See you then.
7) 23) dialog: Whatup bitches!
7) 26) dialog: How's my favorite ballerina?!
7) 33) dialog: Oh no, honey, the only style of dancing I support is exotic... He plunks her on the floor and blows into
7) 35) dialog: Jesus Christ you could feed Africa with this fridge... As Jamie starts prepping a salad across the kitchen, Mitc raids the fridge, packing his cargo pants with kid's snac bagels, yogurts, juice boxes, everything.
7) 36) dialog: These leftovers from Morton's?
7) 38) dialog: Chimichurri. score. As Mitch chews, he eyes Jamie chopping vegetables.
7) 39) dialog: You look hot by the way, Jame. Jamie laughs but clearly doesn't mind the flirtation.
7) 41) dialog: No really. I never would've guessed twins.
7) 48) dialog: Is Dave still meeting your needs sexually? Jamie just laughs, shaking her head, unbelievable.
7) 49) dialog: Oh, did I tell you I ran into Miss Hickam last week at Starbucks?
7) 51) dialog: Yeah. She always liked Dave better than me...
7) 53) dialog: Fair enough. Anyway, I tried to get her number, but she goes "I don't date former students," so I go, "great, do you fuck former students?" and then she calls me a "potty-mouth degenerate" and runs out without her coffee. So I got a free venti macchiato, which is cool-
7) 55) dialog: Awww! Come to Uncle Mitch... Dave hands the twins to Mitch, and they COO, impishly cut
7) 56) dialog: Oh my God, they smell like heaven had sex with a dryer sheet. (loudly to babies)
7) 66) dialog: Really? The one on the left looks a little downsy.
7) 70) dialog: See you, Jame!
8) 0) text: Mitch offers Dave one of (his own) beers as they speed al in his Fiero. Dave is reluctant.
8) 2) dialog: Really? You're going to make me drink alone?
8) 9) dialog: Oh, dude: great news.
8) 11) dialog: That's awesome, because I'm made of emotional Teflon and words can't hurt me anymore. No: I auditioned for a major movie role yesterday.
8) 13) dialog: It's called Busted Dreams 4. It's about a renegade coroner who reads minds named Jake Action. It's like a sexy Mentalist.
8) 15) dialog: Yeah, I read for the part of Steve Action, Jake's troubled younger brother with a secret, and I fucking killed it. I cried like five times during the audition and it's a fucking action movie. Plus I'm the spitting image of the dude who plays Jake Action, so...
8) 17) dialog: Yeah, it could be my Raging Bull. Plus I'd get to kill a lot of women, which is cool. (offering him a joint) Hotbox?
8) 20) text: Mitch and Dave, shit-faced, shake off their shots, B-R-R-
9) 2) dialog: 
9) 4) dialog: Change-up -- fuck he's good!
9) 6) dialog: Of course not. Fernando is like The Highlander. There can be only one.
9) 9) dialog: 
9) 12) dialog: Right! So she calls me up, it's like 3 in the morning--
9) 14) dialog: Tatiana.
9) 21) dialog: Tatiana Calls-Me-At-3-In-The- Morning-And-Wants-To-Fuck-stein, what the fuck, who cares?
9) 23) dialog: 
9) 26) dialog: Okay, well, you're in luck, because Tatiana is stupid fucking hot. Beautiful face, legs a mile long, perfect ass, blonde hair, and huuuge boobs.
9) 28) dialog: Double E.
9) 30) dialog: Who's Sabrina?
9) 32) dialog: Is she on your Cancer List?
9) 34) dialog: Don't all married dudes have a Cancer List? No? Like the first three chicks you would bang if your wife suddenly died of cancer?
9) 42) dialog: Who's number two? Fergie--?
9) 44) dialog: Fine. So Tatiana's packing double E's, which means like 20 plus pounds of breastmeat -- yeah, it's almost too much for one man to handle. Thank God I'm the son of a butcher and have strong hands and wrists. Anyway, she walks in wearing this tight black dress, and you know what she says to me? Dave shakes his head, on the edge of his bar stool.
9) 45) dialog: Nothing. Because all Tatiana wants to do at 3 in the morning is fucky fucky rubber ducky! Dave drunkenly slaps him ten, barely making hand-contact.
9) 46) dialog: And look, I'm not one to kiss and tell... (downing another shot) but this chick is insatiable. She wants it in every position: Missionary, wheelbarrow, Reverse Wheelbarrow, Assassin--
9) 48) dialog: No one does! It gets so intense that my nose starts bleeding. Yeah, so I'm bleeding all over this chick and she's fucking digging it.
9) 55) dialog: It's like some weird Dracula Anne Rice shit, and I'm fading in and out of consciousness, and then, when it's all over, she turns to me and goes: "Tuesday night I'm coming back and we're really going to fuck." Dave just stares at him, glassy-eyed, drunk, emotional.
9) 57) dialog: Ah, it's not always like that...
9) 59) dialog: 
9) 63) dialog: Oh come on, Jamie is hot!
9) 65) dialog: I really want to have sex with her!
9) 72) dialog: And your kids are adorable! They're like fun little puppies that talk! The bill comes. Dave pulls out a wad of cash, throws it o the table, and stumbles for the door. Mitch lifts one of Dave's twenties off the table and follows him out...
10) 2) dialog: Tara? Or Rena? Or Rachel?
10) 4) dialog: It's a national scourge, dude.
10) 6) dialog: Oh come on, you don't mean that--
10) 13) dialog: Dude, I love Drew Barrymore -- have you seen Boys on the Side? They weave across a LARGE PLAZA, stumbling for Mitch's ca
10) 15) dialog: What are you talking about? You've got it all! You've got a huge house full of food and furniture -- shit, your TV is bigger than my car! You have a great job, you make a shit- ton of money, and people respect you, man! My last job involved an ape costume -- do you know what that does to a man? Dave waves him off, not really hearing him. But Mitch is sincere, heartfelt:
10) 16) dialog: Plus you've got a hot, extremely fuckable wife who cooks and cleans and takes care of all your needs! It's like having a really hot mom who you can also have sex with!
10) 18) dialog: Also you're never lonely, you always have someone to talk to about your day, plus you get to do all the fun gay couple stuff like go to wine country! You think single guys can go to wine country?! No way! They won't even let us in! You're living the dream, dude! What more do you want?!
10) 25) dialog: Yeah, me too... They look around the plaza, and their eyes land on the HU FOUNTAIN in the middle; a GREEK GODDESS sits atop it.
10) 26) dialog: Fountain?
10) 28) dialog: This chick does not look happy.
10) 30) dialog: Dude, enough already.
10) 32) dialog: And that's what's so fucked, because I envy yours.
10) 34) dialog: I do!
10) 41) dialog: I wish I had your life! I wish I had your life! They're about to say "jinx" when--
10) 45) dialog: Ummmmm...? Then all the lights in the city flicker back to life...
10) 47) dialog: I guess...? They continue peeing, a little freaked out.
10) 49) dialog: Thank you. Yours is very steamy.
10) 52) dialog: Now I am.
11) 3) dialog: Whose fucking baby is that...? A hand emerges and fumbles on the night stand.
11) 4) dialog: And where the fuck is my bong? He groggily rises from the sheets -- only it's not Mitch. It's Dave. His body, his face, everything. Yup, you got it: the single auy and the married guy have switched bodies. We will refer to them by their "brain names," thus while this hungover dude definitely looks li Dave, inside he's Mitch, so that's what we'll call him. T actors, of course, will remain in their bodies. Mitch doesn't know any of this yet.
11) 5) dialog: Why are there so many fucking pillows...? He rolls over to see Jamie, sitting up in bed, pulling he breasts out of her tank top, getting ready to nurse the twins. Mitch launches out of bed, suddenly very awake.
11) 6) dialog: 
11) 14) dialog: Oh my god that is so gross! Put your tits away! This isn't Europe!
11) 16) dialog: Wait: why am I in...? Did I sleep here last night?!
11) 18) dialog: Did we...?! Panicked, he thrusts his fist like, have sex?!
11) 20) dialog: So why the hell did I wake up in your bed?!
11) 22) dialog: Look, just, where's Dave?!
11) 24) dialog: Where's fucking Dave?!
11) 26) dialog: Oh my God... Oh my God... He slowly touches his new face...
11) 32) dialog: I'm a fucking tool.
12) 0) text: A body lies sprawled on Mitch's futon, out cold. INSANE POUNDING on the door shatters the silence.
12) 9) dialog: I knew it!
12) 18) dialog: I know, dude.
12) 20) dialog: Wait, what? Dave spins, completely awake now:
12) 22) dialog: How should I know?! Has this ever happened to you before?!
12) 24) dialog: Well...I don't want to be you!
12) 26) dialog: What's that supposed to mean?!
12) 28) dialog: Bingo. Got it. We're dreaming. Dave grabs Mitch's nipple and twists it hard.
12) 29) dialog: Ow ow ow, fuck!
12) 36) dialog: First of all, you're a penis. Second of all--
12) 38) dialog: I called you a penis and--
13) 0) text: Dave speeds through morning traffic in his Audi station wagon, leaning on the HORN. Mitch sits shotgun, confused.
13) 2) dialog: 
13) 5) dialog: I thought wishes came true when you threw a coin into a fountain...
13) 7) dialog: That's bullshit! I would've wished for something way cooler!
14) 0) text: Unable to find a parking spot, Mitch and Dave double-park Hollywood Boulevard, hop out, and sprint for the plaza...
14) 1) dialog: What are we gonna do when we get to the fountain?!
14) 8) dialog: That might sound really gay! Both men race around the corner onto the plaza and stop c
14) 12) dialog: Excuse me! Where is the fountain?!
14) 26) dialog: Well of course it's not--!
14) 30) dialog: How can you lose a fountain?.
14) 32) dialog: 
15) 0) text: Dave and Mitch exit the Department of Parks building and on the sunny sidewalk, their hands on their heads, stunne
15) 1) dialog: This is so fucked...
15) 5) dialog: I don't talk like that, dude--
15) 12) dialog: Who was that?
15) 14) dialog: Oh my God! Oh my God! Dreams really do come true--!
15) 17) dialog: What, is that like a big deal?
15) 19) dialog: So what the hell are we gonna do? PANICKED SILENCE. Then Mitch looks at Dave...
15) 21) dialog: Dude, I'm an actor, a human chameleon, I can do lawyer in my fucking sleep! It's you I'm worried about: you can't act for shit!
15) 29) dialog: I mean, we have to...right? Both men look highly anxious. Dave glances at the time.
15) 31) dialog: She sounds hot, is she hot?
15) 33) dialog: Really? Because I can vamp--
15) 35) dialog: Dude, I get it. Play it big, but maintain my reality--
15) 42) dialog: Dude, that's easy as fuck. Okay, for me, go home, put on some cool clothes, and get to set -- all the info is on my phone. Once you're there, go to Hair &amp; Makeup and memorize your lines and try not to be a total douche to everyone, okay? This is the film industry. Everyone is really cool. They look at each other, very doubtful that this will wor
15) 43) dialog: I'm trusting you, dude...
15) 45) dialog: Power hug. They hug tight then release.
15) 47) dialog: (heads for the car) I'm so fucking all over that shit. Off of Dave's deeply unsettled look, we
16) 0) text: Mitch blows into Dave's stodgy law firm looking like a la -- from a Ralph Lauren ad: he sports a pink buttondown, r suspenders, a blue crested blazer, khakis, no socks, blac and white wingtips, and slicked-back hair. He also affects a preposterous patrician accent like John Kerry or any white guy on a black sitcom.
16) 6) dialog: 
16) 11) dialog: Holy dick, are you Gladys? You're a lynx.
16) 13) dialog: A white-haired cougar. You really should dress sexier, though. The whole angry prison nurse thing is a huge mistake. Gladys GASPS and jams some documents into his hands.
16) 15) dialog: Hey, where's my meeting at? She angrily points at a conference room as she stalks off
17) 1) dialog: in his ridiculous outfit. The room goes silent, but Mitch confidence remains sky-high:
17) 2) dialog: What up, white people?! Republican Party in the house, am I right?! Come on, let's get started!
17) 8) dialog: Dave Lockwood, thanks for coming! Dave Lockwood, I did all the work! Dave Lockwood-san, konichi-wa! (to the room) Anyone need anything? Mimosa, spicy tuna roll? No? We're good? All right, guys, take it away! Mitch takes one of the last open seats -- at the head of conference table. It's clearly in his boss's seat. Flemmi Steel III hovers awkwardly.
17) 10) dialog: Fuck yeah! Amalgamated Industries! Finally, even Flemming claps as well, uncomfortable.
17) 20) dialog: Right, my bad-- Thinking that's his cue, he slides Flemming the documents
17) 22) dialog: Okay?
17) 24) dialog: G-Good?
17) 26) dialog: Bad? Bad! They're fucking terrible.
17) 28) dialog: Look, everything's cool, let's just sign this fucking thing and go party! We're all rich, who cares?! Mr. Kinkabe angrily jabs his finger at the incredibly sho CEO of Amalgamated Industries, TED NORTON, 60's.
17) 39) dialog: Relax, dude ... this-this is all part of my master plan.
17) 41) dialog: Yes! Check it out: if we drag this out...we make more money, right? Don't we? Of course we do! And then we can bill the fuck out of them! Some of them don't even speak-ah the engrish so goo, you know what I'm saying?
17) 43) dialog: Yes...? Is it...? It's not a very good plan, is it.
17) 45) dialog: 
17) 53) dialog: Fuck that, ese. I'm straight up gangster all the way through. Flemming eyes him, determining his fate. Mitch can't brea
19) 0) text: Mitch drives Cara home from ballet. She sits shotgun in h tutu, looking small and sad.
19) 7) dialog: Whatever, you're fine -- hey, what's up with that little blonde bitch who knocked you over? She looks a little surprised by her dad's language.
19) 9) dialog: So why don't you fight back?
19) 11) dialog: Fuck verbal resolution! Put that whore on her back and shank her! Do you know how to make a shiv?
19) 13) dialog: Listen to me, kid: the world is a cesspool of cruelty and violence. If someone comes at you with a knife, you gotta put their entire fucking family in the morgue, okay? That's called jailyard justice. Because if you don't come back hard on a bitch, your ass is gonna get sold for a pack of Camel Lights and a jello cup, y'understand? Always solve your problems with violence. Always. Cara nods, alarmed.
19) 23) dialog: Cry me a river, dude: I dealt with ballet and your ass-hat boss today.
19) 25) dialog: Nothing! Nothing. (off Dave's look) I fixed it. (off Dave's look) Okay, but look, it was not my fault! The Japs started peppering me with questions and I had to improvise and then everyone got very emotional and, well... it looks like we're going to court.
19) 27) dialog: Yeah, your boss was pretty miffed, but then I told him this was all part of my master plan to make more money off our clients--
19) 29) dialog: Yeah, turns out that's totally illegal, but the old man was surprisingly cool about it. Dave sits there, speechless. Mitch eats wings.
19) 30) dialog: Hey, your secretary is sort of hot in like a Dame Judi Dench-playing-a- Nazi kind of way. Is she on the fuck team?
20) 0) text: Dave and Mitch head up Dave's front walk, solemn...
20) 1) dialog: What are you gonna tell Jamie?
20) 3) dialog: Can I highly recommend against that?
21) 0) text: Mitch and Dave enter to find Cara running down the stairs her Dora the Explorer pajamas. Dave smiles and opens his arms, tired and overjoyed to see her...
21) 3) dialog: Well hello, my precocious daughter!
21) 13) dialog: No shit.
21) 18) dialog: I'm Mitch. Somehow.. .we switched bodies last night. He's Dave. Jamie looks back and forth between them, expressionless.
21) 19) dialog: You see, what happened was, we peed into a magic fountain--
21) 21) dialog: But as soon as they find it, we're going to switch back.
21) 23) dialog: Are you kidding? Is she kidding? Clearly yes. Jamie heads for the stairs when Dave stops h
21) 35) dialog: Dude, it's March 24th, even I know that.
21) 37) dialog: So that I can send you a thoughtful card -- what kind of monster are you?
21) 40) dialog: Jamie, please.
21) 48) dialog: Mauve.
21) 50) dialog: I'm just saying, look at all the accents in this room -- she loves mauve.
21) 55) dialog: Dude, you are like the worst husband ever.
21) 57) dialog: Okay, look, calm down: I can hold down the fort for one night.
21) 59) dialog: Dude, the kids are already going to bed.
21) 66) dialog: I think I can handle watching Two And A Half fucking Men and falling asleep on the couch with the best of 'em. The only roadblock I foresee is: what do I tell Jamie?
21) 68) dialog: When she wants to have sex tonight.
21) 70) dialog: I don't understand. You don't have sex on Tuesdays? A beat. Then Dave starts LAUGHING. It builds. Dave hasn't laughed this hard in a long time. He pats Mitch's cheek.
21) 73) dialog: Really?! You want me to bang your wife??
22) 0) text: Dave parks Mitch's Fiero on this shady Silver Lake street glancing at the HOMELESS GUY stumbling by, a bit scared.
23) 0) text: Dave enters Mitch's apartment and flips on the bright overhead light. The white walls are empty. A futon, TV, a four crates of bird seed are all that occupy the living r

23) 13) dialog: Hey dude, I take back everything I said about Two and a Half Men. This is some edgy shit--
23) 15) dialog: Nice.
23) 17) dialog: I think you should fuck her, that's what I think you should do. Jamie looks over at Mitch, weirded out; he gets up and crosses into the hallway for some privacy.
23) 23) dialog: Don't blow this for me, dude, she's my Tuesday night regular.
23) 25) dialog: No! Cheating is when any part of your penis touches any part of another woman who is not your wife, and last I checked, your wang is safely tucked away in my incredibly lame triple-pleated sport slacks.
23) 27) dialog: Dude, how many women have you fucked in your mind? Thousands?
23) 29) dialog: Right, and that's not cheating, right?
23) 31) dialog: I think you're on firm legal ground here, amigo. I say jump that ass.
23) 33) dialog: Well, it still works the same, but this chick is a lot to handle so pace yourself, okay? She's hornier than a priest at summer camp.
23) 41) dialog: You'll do fine. Just wear a condom, okay? Don't give me AIDS-- Just then WHAM -- the door flies open and a very sexy blo enters the apartment wearing a long trenchcoat and five i stiletto heels. She moves towards Dave like a panther.
24) 0) text: It's bedtime. Wearing pajama pants and no shirt, Mitch brushes his teeth and fixes his hair, trying to look sexy sucks in his dad-gut in the mirror.
24) 1) dialog: Jesus, Dave, it's called a sit-up. Then he sees Jamie's dress land on the bedroom floor, followed by her bra... Mitch exhales:
24) 2) dialog: Holy shit, I'm finally going to fuck Jamie. This is my greatest hour! I hope she likes it weird! Then, IN SLOW MOTION, Jamie enters the bathroom, nude, he hair gently blowing in the wind from an open window. She looks insanely hot. Mitch takes her all in, ravenous...
24) 3) dialog: Oh my God I am going to ruin her-- And then she sits on the can. And starts taking a dump. Mitch's face drops, horrified.
24) 10) dialog: Oh my GOD.
25) 0) text: Mitch lies in bed, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling, horrified. Jamie slides in bed with him, touches his arm-
25) 1) dialog: 
25) 5) dialog: Look, I am not attracted to you right now, okay?! So just... No means no, all right? No means no... TIGHT ON Jamie rolling over, confused and genuinely hurt.
25) 18) dialog: No, it's 3 in the morning, you go do it. You're the mother.
25) 20) dialog: Yes Jamie I'm sorry Jamie!
26) 0) text: Mitch just looks at the twins, SCREAMING in their respect cribs, no idea what to do. He reaches for the phone. Dial
26) 3) dialog: I always thought your wife was a nice lady but she is neither nice nor a lady! She talks like a dock- worker and she shits like one too! Plus I used to think your kids were adorable but actually they're just really fucking annoying and crazy needy-- Wait, are you jacking off?
26) 5) dialog: So why are you panting?
26) 12) dialog: But isn't that sort of...my penis? Dave looks down.
26) 14) dialog: I. .don't know?
26) 16) dialog: Yeah. Go lefty, you'll get better torque.
26) 18) dialog: It's kind of pro forma now, dude.
26) 20) dialog: Yeah, only married dudes still rock dick-fros anymore-- wait: if Tatiana was over earlier, why do you still need to jack off?
26) 22) dialog: What did you do?!
26) 24) dialog: Oh my God you're so picky!
26) 31) dialog: So what, she's having a girl! It wouldn't have been a little boy tickling your tip! Jesus, I can't believe you fucked up my Tuesday night regular!
26) 33) dialog: No! You married guys have no idea how hard it is to build a reliable stable! You don't! It's a full time job! Getting girls' phone numbers, calling them, emailing them, Facebooking them, Twittering them, buying them drinks and dinners and coffees and listening to endless stories about their stupid fucking friends and begging them to touch your wiener on the second date and building an elaborate web of lies so they don't all find out about each other -- it's exhausting! And then poof! In one night, you just casually discard my life's work!
26) 35) dialog: Sorry doesn't lick my ballbag every Tuesday night...
26) 37) dialog: Yeah, your mean wife is making me feed the kids. What do I do?
26) 39) dialog: (beat, lying) Yes. Obviously.
26) 46) dialog: Hold on. Mitch puts the phone in his mouth and picks up the SCREAM TWINS. Carrying them like bags of wheat, he jogs down
26) 48) dialog: 
27) 0) text: Mitch jogs into the kitchen and, plop, sets the twins on COUNTER, then speaks into the phone again:
27) 1) dialog: All right. In the kitchen.
27) 3) dialog: Yeah?
27) 5) dialog: Holy fuck! Mitch yanks Peter away just as SPARKS shoot from the sock

37) 47) dialog: No dude: you're so fucking laid!
37) 49) dialog: I'm sorry, I just got you a date with the number one girl on your Cancer List and this is the thanks I get?
37) 51) dialog: Yes you are.
37) 58) dialog: Yes you are, because if you don't, I will feed'your children non- organic snacks and then introduce them to my extensive girl-on-horse pornography collection. How do you think Jamie will react to that? Dave just looks at Mitch, horrified.
37) 60) dialog: Because I've seen your life and if you don't loosen up soon you are literally going to die. So go out with this chick. Have fun. Bust a nut. Remember why life is beautiful again, okay? Please? This actually gets to Dave a bit. He frowns, fine...
37) 61) dialog: Also, see if she likes to fuck on Tuesday nights, because you owe me a regular.

38) 13) dialog: (quick, sharp) What's that supposed to mean? MITCH, SR. Nothing! Nothing. How are y--?
38) 14) dialog: I mean, you still have a really fucking cool son, right?! MITCH, SR. Yes, Mitch is definitely cool... How are the twins?
38) 15) dialog: They're fucking fine-- what the fuck does that mean, "Mitch is definitely cool?!" MITCH, SR.
38) 17) dialog: But what, dude?! Spit it out! MITCH, SR. But now he's a total fuck up. Mitch actually GASPS. His dad smiles sadly:
38) 25) dialog: Your son is not a fuck up, M-Mr. Planko! He's just a late bloomer! His dad looks utterly confused as Mitch gets into the car MITCH, SR. Dave? Are you crying...?
38) 26) dialog: I'm sorry, I'm just very close to Mitch and when people say mean things about him I hurt too-- He SLAMS the door shut and jerks out of the parking spot, tears pouring down his face. His dad watches on, bewilder

49) 32) dialog: Like a fucking tool. Step aside-- Mitch throws open the closet and yanks out a pair of jean
49) 33) dialog: These are called jeans. They've been very popular with our nation's young people for over 60 years. Put them on immediately.
49) 35) dialog: Shut up and do what I say. We only have 3 hours to make you cool...
50) 0) text: Mitch shows Dave how to put gel into his hair.
50) 6) dialog: This is called gel, or product. Use too little and you look like a pedophile Cub Scout leader, use too much and you look Persian. Neither is a winning hand. Dave very nervously applies gel to his hair...
51) 0) text: Dave stands with his pants around his ankles as Mitch ver delicately shaves his balls with a Bic razor.
51) 1) dialog: Okay, normally I would never do this for another man, but since we're in a rush, and technically this is my testicle bag, I'm making a rare exception. Always man-scape before a first date. It shows a lady that you're clean, considerate, and American.
51) 4) dialog: Don't speak, it jiggles your sack.

52) 9) dialog: Do me a favor, Dave. Relax your butt hole.
52) 11) dialog: Your sphincter. Just... release it. Dave's entire body visibly relaxes a bit.
52) 12) dialog: You didn't even know it was puckered, right? Now recline your seat a bit...
52) 14) dialog: Now, just for like three minutes, don't be a dad, don't be a husband, don't be a lawyer, just be a dude rolling down Sunset strip in a fucking Ferrari with his best friend listening to Seal, okay? Dave looks out the window, getting into it...
52) 15) dialog: Feels good, right? After a moment, a TEAR escapes from under Dave's shades.
52) 16) dialog: It's okay, just let it out.
52) 18) dialog: I know, baby. I know. They cruise for a bit longer, then Mitch pulls into a CAR WASH. Dave looks confused.

53) 1) dialog: Now. I don't have time to cover all the ways in which women have changed since you last dated... Mitch stops at the register to pay. Various CAR WASH EMPLOYEES keep saying hi to Dave, weirding him out.
53) 3) dialog: The bottom line is: the internet has revolutionized everything.
53) 5) dialog: Fuck J-date. No. The internet has changed chicks in three major ways: first, access and acceptance of pornography has commoditized women and pressured them into becoming sluttier at far younger ages, which is awesome. Mitch finishes paying and continues through the car wash.
53) 6) dialog: Second: text messaging has de- stigmatized the booty call. Call a girl at 3 in the morning for sex and it's creepy. Text her "SUCK WANG MIDNIGHT??" and it's classy. I have no idea why, but again, an awesome development.
53) 13) dialog: Third: Facebook and other social networking sites have falsely convinced people -- women included -- that they are funny, interesting, and unique. Get used to listening waaay more than you used to. Chicks are the new dudes, they talk about themselves all the fucking time now. Practice saying things like "you are so different" and "no, really, what Golden Girl would you be?" and "I love Lady Gaga too."
53) 15) dialog: I don't know, it's either a pop singer or an energy drink. They arrive at the CAR WASH WAITING AREA. People sit arou waiting for their cars, many of them young, female, and c
53) 16) dialog: Okay, let's talk to some honeys, get your flow going again.
53) 18) dialog: The girls are alone, bored, and old enough to drive -- it's a goldmine. I run game here four to seven times a week. Now go on, bust a move.
53) 20) dialog: Really.
53) 22) dialog: Reall v!
53) 29) dialog: Okay Daddy Day Care show me how it's done then! Shit! Dave sighs and crosses to a CUTE BLONDE texting nearby. A draws closer, however, he starts to tense up...soon he's sweating... it's been a long time ...by the time he final reaches the blonde, his voice is ridiculously shrill:
53) 33) dialog: Shake it off. Being single is like the Tour De France: it's all about quick recovery time. Now go on, get your groove back, you're meeting Sabrina in a half hour.
53) 48) dialog: Forty seconds. Not bad. Your times are improving.
53) 50) dialog: As a general rule, when you're talking to single women, conversation topics to avoid include: your wife, your children, your favorite playgrounds, and The Wiggles... Dave nods, hating himself. Mitch heads for the Ferrari.
53) 51) dialog: But this was good. You worked out all your bad game and now you're ready to dominate. Come on.
54) 0) text: Mitch rockets down Sunset Boulevard. Dave looks nauseous.
54) 7) dialog: Relax: you're dressed cool, your hair is crushing it, your ballsack is taut and smooth, and you're way better looking than you've ever been. Just remember Uncle Mitch's Golden Rule of Dating.
54) 9) dialog: What? No. No, my Golden Rule of Dating is always find the fun. Think of it like this: for the next two hours, you're stuck with this chick. Doesn't matter if she's cool or crazy or if she was born with a vagina on her forehead -- you're stuck, so make the most of it. I dated this chick named Topaz once who may or may not have killed her father. Long story short, she looked like 50 miles of bad road and I wasn't interested, but I used our time together to learn about incest and the failures of the American Appellate Court system. I found it hugely informative, and Topaz got caught up in my enthusiasm and gave me a crying blowjob on the car-ride home, so everybody won. The point is: find the fun for yourself and great things will follow. Dave looks horrified as they roll up to RICHTER'S, a chic steakhouse.
54) 10) dialog: Power hug. Mitch hugs a still-speechless Dave...
54) 11) dialog: Now go on. Make daddy proud.

66) 7) dialog: Really? Open-toed sandals at work?
66) 9) dialog: Look, I can't hang right now, okay? I've got the mediation in like ten minutes. Dave stands right back up, surprised and impressed.
66) 11) dialog: 700 million, you got it.
66) 14) dialog: What?! Dave: No. You can't, you have to wait at least a week! Dave reaches for his cellphone as he heads out the door.
66) 16) dialog: You sent her flowers after one date?! Are you retarded?! Do not get me into a relationship, dude! Too late. Dave is already gone. Mitch scowls. Then:
66) 17) dialog: You can come out now, Gladys... A second later, GLADYS, in a form-fitting suit and a sexy bob, crawls out from under his desk. Mitch zips up his pa
66) 23) dialog: Look, honey, I don't think this is
66) 26) dialog: F-Fine, but can you please stop following me to the bathroom and calling my house late at night and sending me all those filthy emails? It's, you know, deeply disturbing.

69) 1) dialog: 14! 14 sandwiches and 9 Diet Slice's! Pay up, cocksucker! An EXEC gives him a 5 dollar bill. Mitch waves it in the and HUMS the Olympic theme song. Flemming just glares at like, you're so fired. Then the mediator enters.
69) 4) dialog: Fuck that, dude, you can do better.
69) 12) dialog: Look, this is just like when you're trying to fuck a Jewish girl and she keeps saying "no, no, I don't want to, I'm really drunk and you're not circumcised" but then she keeps making out with you and not getting out of your Fiero so you know she really does want it, she just needs to be nudged a bit more so she can rationalize it to herself and to her God, know what I mean? This is just like that. Everyone in the room is speechless. Mitch opens another s
69) 13) dialog: Jesus I do not feel good.
69) 15) dialog: If this was really their final offer, they'd leave. Instead, they're sticking around, which means they have more money to spend. Ted looks at his execs. It's not a terrible point...
69) 17) dialog: Fuck it, homey, go for 100.
69) 20) dialog: Enh, can't hurt to ask. You wouldn't believe the nasty shit I get girls to do just by asking. Honestly, it's revolting.
69) 26) dialog: Seriously, does anyone have a Pepto? Because I'm gonna throw. Finally, Ted opens the door and says to the mediator:
69) 28) dialog: Nice, bro. Way to show some sack.
69) 30) dialog: Hey, me too. Bones. He extends his fist. Ted ignores him and gathers his thin
70) 12) dialog: Fuck it. Helping ridiculously rich people become even more ridiculously rich is why I go to work every day.
70) 14) dialog: I am?! Fuck, I've never really been good at anything before... Mitch considers this a second, then laughs, proud.
70) 15) dialog: Gimme me a hug you tiny capitalist! Mitch hugs Ted and lifts him off the ground, spinning him
70) 16) dialog: I love you so much...
71) 31) dialog: You hear about the fountain?
71) 33) dialog: Sure. Right. I mean... the funny thing is...I was just starting to enjoy your life a little bit...
71) 35) dialog: Really?
71) 37) dialog: So.. .maybe we should keep going--?
71) 39) dialog: I'm so glad I said that too! Your life rocks!
71) 46) dialog: I just closed the Amalgamated deal for 825 million dollars and for the first time ever, people actually respect me! It's so weird! Word is they're going to make me partner tonight! I love your life, dude!
71) 48) dialog: Dude, you sent her flowers -- she's gonna fuck you like a crack whore on rent day.

74) 11) dialog: (wiping face, a bit scared) O-Okay? Well, I guess what's bothering me is...I didn't earn any of this, you know? Gladys rips open his shirt and starts licking his chest downward until she disappears OUT OF FRAME.
74) 17) dialog: And I know what you're thinking: Mitch, not earning things never used to bother you, why does it bother you now? And the answer is: maybe I'm growing up. We hear the sound of his pants UNZIPPING...
74) 18) dialog: I mean, sure, I closed the deal today, and that felt good, but I didn't put in all the years of hard work that got Dave to this point, you know? Plus, those aren't my adorable kids, that's not my beautiful wife, you're not even my freaky deaky old lady secretary. I want to earn this stuff-- Just then FLEMMING STEEL III BLOWS IN -- and stops cold:

77) 10) dialog: Right. Right. Well, I thought this time was different, you know? I thought I actually did something right for once. But no, I'm still the same old fuck up I've always been. Only this time I really fucking fucked up, because I fucked up my life and my best friend's life... Mitch zips up his bag, full of regret -- and finds Cara hugging his leg.
77) 16) dialog: Thanks, sweetie, but your brain is the size of a radish. I am a fuck up. I always have been, and I always will be.
