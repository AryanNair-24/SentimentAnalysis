2) 86) dialog: (still holds out hand) Hi, I'm Elise Kraft, National Security  Council.
2) 90) dialog: We're all on the same team here,  Agent Hubbard.
2) 92) dialog: It's never the question that's  indiscreet, only the answer.
2) 95) dialog: There's no reason to be nasty.
2) 97) dialog: Not according to the Cooperation  Agreement, Special Order 12333 -- I  suggest you reread the paragraph on  sharing information. I happen to be  well within my authority.
2) 99) dialog: (holds up a clipboard) Unfortunately, not yet. But as soon  as I do, I'll --
2) 101) dialog: Swell.
2) 103) dialog: Nice meeting you, too, Special Agent  Hubbard.
3) 0) text: Hub is looking at surveillance photos of Elise. Frank ent
3) 87) dialog: Ralph, spare us.
3) 89) dialog: I never touched him.
3) 91) dialog: What are you going to charge him  with? Jaywalking? (Hub stares at her) I don't suppose we could just have a  little chat with him here first?
3) 93) dialog: You know, Hub... may I call you Hub?  If you guys hadn't blown the  surveillance, we'd have been able to  follow the money. What do you think,  Khalil, you would have led us right  to your friends, wouldn't you?
3) 99) dialog: One phone call and he's mine again.  You know the number. I have --
3) 101) dialog: (overlapping him) Oh, come on... Do you have any idea  what you're starting here, the kind  of shitstorm you're about to --
3) 108) dialog: Shouf mountains, right? Shiite or  Sunni?
3) 111) dialog: (to Haddad) American University of Beirut? I was  there from '79 to 82.
3) 113) dialog: My father taught Economics. Henry  Kraft?
3) 115) dialog: (ignoring him; to  Haddad) Such a tragedy. Growing up in that  city was... paradise. Like an exotic  Paris, wasn't it, Frank --?
3) 117) text: Elise looks at him, utterly unfazed by the threat.
3) 118) dialog: ...Yum.
3) 131) dialog: What's happening out there...
3) 133) dialog: They've taken another bus, haven't  they? Talk to me...
3) 135) dialog: Listen, these guys are the real deal.
3) 139) dialog: (a long moment) Yes.
3) 141) dialog: Yes. And I'm afraid this time they'll  blow the bus.
3) 143) dialog: I... don't know.
3) 145) dialog: Agent Hubbard. Please. Maybe I can  help.
3) 152) dialog: (almost involuntary) Oh, God.
3) 154) dialog: (as it dawns on her) ...They're not here to negotiate.
3) 156) dialog: They were waiting for the cameras.
3) 159) text: Hub looks up. Frank nods for Elise to repeat what she sai
3) 160) dialog: They're want the newsies here. They  want everybody watching.
3) 162) dialog: You've got the shooters in place?
3) 164) dialog: Use 'em.
3) 166) dialog: Kill 'em now.
3) 168) dialog: It's lose-lose any way you play it...  Do you want to lose little or lose  big?
3) 171) text: As the Policeman waits for a response on his radio, two m NEWS VANS pull up. The MEDIA CIRCUS has come to town:  reporters breathlessly offer their live, on-the-scene rep Hub and Elise stare at one another.
3) 173) text: Hub can see the dread in Elise's eyes. As the seconds tic away, TWO NEWS HELICOPTER jockey for position above.
3) 187) text: No response -- then suddenly, the bus doors HISS OPEN And six bewildered, ashen-faced CHILDREN step out before doors HISS closed behind them. As Hub and a couple of the cops hurry out from behind the barricades to help the chi cross the NO-MAN'S LAND to safety, a smattering of APPLAU breaks out among the cops. Elise tries to hold back tears
3) 190) text: Elise watches as the news cameras zoom in.
3) 194) text: Elise looks at Frank, she can't help but admire his brave
3) 297) text: He looks at Frank. It's just as Elise said. The real deal
3) 301) dialog: I didn't make the call.
3) 304) dialog: Are you alright --?
3) 308) dialog: Life's too short.
3) 311) dialog: We ordering in --?
3) 314) dialog: -- The funeral shroud is the final  step in the ritual of self- purification. First a fast, then --
3) 317) dialog: ...Last March in Iraq, we identified  the man we believe responsible for  bombing the army barracks last year.  In August, he went to Lebanon. Where  he was... extracted.
3) 319) dialog: His name is Sheik Ahmed bin Talal.  He's Iraqi. And something of a  religious leader.
3) 321) dialog: He's still being... debriefed. They're  not ready to go public with charges.
3) 323) dialog: Clearly, they're committed.
3) 325) dialog: In this game, the most committed  wins.
3) 327) dialog: Unless we match their commitment  with our own.
3) 329) dialog: You don't think they've got guys  talking to the sheik? Except the  sheik isn't talking.
3) 331) dialog: Believe me, we've put every resource  we've got onto that very question. (puts down her fork) Otherwise... we wait.
3) 334) dialog: If there's anybody on earth who knows  how you feel, it's me. But you've  got to let it go. Those people were  dead the minute they got on the bus.
3) 343) dialog: You might consider leaving him alone.
3) 346) dialog: Play him like a cop and haul him in  now and get your arrest, or tag him  and let him lead you to the really  big fish.
3) 348) dialog: You ever heard of catch and release?
3) 350) text: Hub looks at Elise. Samir is leaving -- it's now or never
3) 358) text: Elise is looking out the window, seemingly oblivious.
3) 361) text: Elise tries to keep a smile off her face. Hub clocks this
3) 371) dialog: Club Fed.
3) 375) text: He leads Frank into another CUBICLE. Perched on nearby de Elise is dialing a phone, she stops to watch them:
3) 382) dialog: I still don't understand why we're  tipping our hand with him --
3) 386) dialog: ...Sometimes... in addition to being  a nationality, being a Palestinian  is also a... profession. A lucrative  one.
3) 388) dialog: Mine. Yours. The Israelis. The Saudis.  At one time or another, everybody in  the Middle East has slept with  everybody else.
3) 390) dialog: Only professionally.
3) 392) dialog: No.
3) 394) dialog: I can't let you do that.
3) 396) dialog: (sighs, then:) Samir's been a very important...  project of mine for some time... I'm  the only one he'll deal with. He's  very well-connected -- and extremely  high-strung.
3) 398) dialog: (looks at Frank) How easy is it to get inside, Frank?  How good are your sources in the  mosques? How many people you got in  Hamas --?
3) 400) dialog: No surveillance. I've seen your deft  touch.
3) 402) dialog: And I get to see the transcripts.
3) 404) dialog: And I run him.
3) 406) dialog: He can't know we're talking.
3) 408) dialog: Done.
3) 412) dialog: Not tonight.
3) 416) text: And he's gone. Frank turns to Elise:
3) 424) dialog: We are in her apartment. Samir looms over her.
3) 426) dialog: Next time don't be such a smart ass --
3) 428) text: Elise can taste the blood in her mouth -- but it's the pr she's come to accept. In a heartbeat, it's all business.
3) 429) dialog: -- You want to fuck me? Then work  with me.
3) 431) dialog: No? Do we really want to have this  conversation again? Do we --?
3) 432) text: Something quietly ominous in her tone. He lowers his eyes And like a sailboat, Elise changes tack. Strokes his arm.
3) 433) dialog: I need you to help me. I need you to  be strong. As you have always been  strong. For both of us. -- Samir?  Look at me...
3) 441) dialog: -- So who are you afraid of betraying?  You know these people. They bomb,  they maim. Do they represent the  Palestine you want to build? (looks at him) They're using you.
3) 443) dialog: I had to get special permission for  that.
3) 479) text: Devereaux rises, offers his hand. As they shake, Elise st her head in the door without knocking.
3) 480) dialog: Hub, we've got Judge Frankel in -- (as Devereaux turns  around) Oh. Hello, General.
3) 482) dialog: (to Hub) Sorry. That tip on the landlord looks  solid. The judge will see us right  away.
3) 484) dialog: As can be expected. How's Maggie?
3) 486) text: And he's gone. Elise turns to Hub.
3) 487) dialog: Making new friends.
3) 490) dialog: So... you like to watch --?
3) 492) dialog: It's a full contact sport.
3) 500) text: Elise sits quietly beside Frank, observing Hub's trials.
3) 512) text: Hub catches Elise's eye -- "we're out of here."
3) 514) dialog: -- Not two Judges from now, not two  HOURS from now, not two MINUTES from  now. These guys could split any SECOND  and you've lost your best shot at --
3) 516) dialog: You don't understand, they're pros!  From the age of twelve they've been  dodging people like you, people better  than you.
3) 518) dialog: -- no matter how sparkling your record  is, no matter how terrified you are  to fail --
3) 521) dialog: -- Just because you went to night  school, or filled out the back of a  matchbook or whatever you did to get  a law degree doesn't make you Sir  Thomas More.
3) 523) dialog: You're gonna lose them and they're  gonna do another horrible --
3) 525) dialog: They've also got a warrant. A warrant  from God. They're ready to die! And  your quaint laws don't mean shit to  these people.
3) 527) dialog: Oh, really...?
3) 530) dialog: They're discussing how hard it is to  find a decent cup of coffee over  here. (hands headset to  Frank) I make out three voices. What do you  have on the infrared?
3) 559) dialog: (softly) Gone.
3) 560) text: Hub picks himself up in time to see Elise, kneeling besid the body of the Young Arab, her hand on his boyish chest.
3) 573) dialog: (sips her drink) My first boyfriend was Palestinian.  My father liked to say, they seduce  you with their suffering.
3) 575) dialog: You ever been over there --? (he shakes his head,  no) ...The courtesy with which they  welcome you into their homes. And  the people, these incredibly... warm  people in this... austere land.
3) 577) dialog: Only the crazies. I tend to be  suspicious of all true believers. (looks at him) Present company included.
3) 579) dialog: Let's just say you don't seem the  ambivalent type.
3) 581) dialog: So why're are you a fed?
3) 583) dialog: ...Well? What'd you tell him?
3) 585) dialog: Let's see... Catholic school. Captain  of this, president of that. Hard  work, fair play, make a difference,  change the system from within. Rah.  Rah. Rah.
3) 587) dialog: ...Tell me I'm wrong.
3) 589) dialog: ...What --?
3) 591) dialog: Like what, for instance?
3) 593) dialog: It's easy to choose between right  and wrong. What's hard is choosing  the wrong that's more right. I just  want to make it all... a little...  better. (finishes her drink) Ignore me. I'm shitfaced.
3) 596) dialog: You were in charge of Waco, right -- ? Or was that Ruby Ridge?
3) 598) dialog: Yeah, yeah, yeah... And J. Edgar  Hoover wore a dress.
3) 600) dialog: What do you say, Hub...? Peace?
3) 602) dialog: This feels like high school.
3) 604) dialog: Mine's a 9 mm. How big is yours?
3) 606) dialog: Not sure he'll do it.
3) 608) dialog: -- Samir's a source. Period.
3) 610) dialog: Samir in bed with them? That would  too much to wish for.
3) 612) dialog: Only in bed.
3) 617) text: But Elise is not too drunk to make her way to the door. H joins her. Already, in the distance, the WAILING OF SIREN
3) 632) text: Hub ignores the reporter. He sees that Elise is already  tearing off part of her skirt to bandage a SOCIETY MATRON He takes off his coat and goes to work beside her.
3) 704) dialog: We all know the traditional model of  a terrorist network. One cell  controlling all others. Cut off the  head and the body will wither.
3) 705) text: Hub looks to the back of the room at Elise, who's no long Elise. She looks blithely at Hub as if nothing is amiss.
3) 706) dialog: Unfortunately the old wisdom no longer  applies. The new paradigm is like  the myth of the Hydra. Each cell  exists independent of the other. Cut  off one head and another rises up in  its place.
3) 709) dialog: Bus 87 was the work of Cell #1. Its  elimination only activated the work  of Cell #2 -- the theatre gala.
3) 713) text: Everyone looks to Sharon/Elise. Hub looks at her, too.
3) 717) dialog: We don't know.
3) 724) text: A JEEP pulls up and Elise/Sharon gets out.
3) 727) dialog: This is Colonel Hardwick. Army  Intelligence.
3) 742) text: A KNOCK on the door. They look at one another. One of the agents answers it. Elise/Sharon. She walks over to them.
3) 743) dialog: I'm... very sorry... about your  friends.
3) 745) dialog: ...Bridger. How ya doin' Frank?
3) 748) dialog: The agency has come up with another  list of probables.
3) 750) dialog: I think we should circulate them. (they stonewall her:) Hey, this stuff may be good.
3) 752) dialog: Because he didn't know anything.
3) 754) dialog: Says me.
3) 756) dialog: Over my dead body.
3) 759) dialog: Look, he's one of the good guys.  Okay?
3) 761) dialog: Because he helped me recruit the  network in Iraq. OKAY?
3) 763) dialog: We were part of the operation to  destabilize Saddam Hussein. Printing  up fake dinars, arming the Kurds --
3) 765) dialog: He's Iraqi. He was going to be our  Ayatollah Khomeini --
3) 767) dialog: I ran the network. Samir was the go- between. He risked his life for us  over there.
3) 769) dialog: I can't give you pictures because I  don't know what they look like. We  did everything at arm's length.
3) 771) dialog: I've got Samir.
3) 773) dialog: Minimal.
3) 775) dialog: He can't. They initiate.
3) 777) dialog: He's waiting.
3) 779) dialog: Look, I know how you must feel --
3) 781) dialog: They'll make contact soon.
3) 786) dialog: You burn him, you lose any chance  you ever had.
3) 788) dialog: I'm not fucking with you.
3) 791) dialog: I need... more time. Please. You're  hurting me. Please...
5) 1) dialog: This just came in.
5) 3) dialog: You alright?
5) 5) dialog: (a long look) That's not what I meant.
5) 9) dialog: Sure.
5) 11) dialog: That was a pretty crazy thing you  did today.
5) 15) dialog: I wanted to -- I... just didn't feel  like... being alone... tonight.
5) 17) dialog: I could call him. Maybe he'd join  us.
5) 19) dialog: I might. Or I could call Tina.
5) 22) dialog: Look, I thought Samir'd be an easy  recruit. He wasn't. It was crazy but  I did what I had to do. (looks at him) You know as well as I do, running an  agent can be very... complicated.
5) 24) dialog: You think I'm trying to run you?
5) 26) dialog: (staring right back) ...You know why I'm here.
5) 28) dialog: Tell me to leave.
5) 30) dialog: No.
5) 86) dialog: He'll fuck it up, the arrogant prick.  You ever met anybody so in love with  the sound of his own voice?
5) 88) dialog: Now? With all this going on? He's  freaked.
5) 91) dialog: All this... is no more in our interest  than it is in yours, Hub.
5) 93) dialog: You have no idea what I do for my  country.
5) 96) dialog: One more lamb to the slaughter.
5) 102) dialog: Samir... It's fine, he's cool.
5) 115) dialog: Liar --!
5) 117) dialog: You... tell him... what he wants to  know.
5) 119) dialog: He knows. He fucking knows.
5) 121) dialog: Stop simpering.
5) 123) dialog: I've got a picture of the two of us,  do you remember that picture, Samir? (the mask coming off:) I'm going to post that picture in  every mosque in Brooklyn. And then  I'm gonna send copies to some friends  of mine on the West Bank. You've got  family there, don't you --?
5) 125) dialog: Let go of me --
5) 136) dialog: You're good.
5) 143) dialog: You calling Devereaux.
5) 152) dialog: Tariq will go to ground.
5) 154) dialog: (turns to leave) Hit him hard.
5) 156) dialog: I've got to stash Samir someplace  safe. (as she goes) Go with God.
7) 51) dialog: Not long enough, apparently.
7) 58) dialog: At this rate. Too long. The theatre  was hit nine hours after we took  down the first cell.
7) 64) dialog: -- Won't work.
7) 66) dialog: Only in conjunction with sleep  deprivation. Needs at least thirty- six hours.
7) 71) dialog: The neurotransmitters just shut down.
7) 90) dialog: He knew nothing.
7) 124) dialog: I ran an Iraqi network for two years.  Samir recruited them from among the  Sheik's followers. I trained them in  the North. Then we played them back  into Baghdad, two, three at a time,  hiding them in the mosques...
7) 126) dialog: It was gonna be beautiful. (looks away) -- And then there was a policy shift --
7) 128) dialog: -- The new doctrine was: Iran will  be too powerful if Iraq falls apart. (her voice trembles) And it's not like... we sold them  out. Exactly. We just... stopped...  helping them. And I wasn't allowed  to tell them what was coming down. I  was ordered not to tell them. (fighting back tears) -- And they got slaughtered.
7) 130) dialog: You've got to understand -- these  people... believe. Paradise. Bliss.  To us they're just words. But to  them... It's very beautiful, actually.  And when you look at their lives,  the heartbreak... And what do we do?  We think, aha, we can take advantage  of that. (losing it) So I quit. I came home. I just  can't... do it... anymore.
7) 134) dialog: What do you mean --?
7) 136) dialog: I promised we would take care of  them. They were working... for us.
7) 138) dialog: I don't know what you mean.
7) 143) dialog: And I'm going to have to live with  the hell of that for the rest of my  life.
7) 153) dialog: In case you decide to go on walkabout.
7) 155) dialog: How did you make contact?
7) 157) dialog: But you're sure he'll show up.
7) 159) dialog: I need to deliver it in person.  Believe me, they'll want to hear  what I have to say.
7) 171) dialog: That's Samir.
7) 174) dialog: He's terrified. Then again, so am I.
7) 176) dialog: If he doesn't he knows I'll give him  to Devereaux. (She mouths, "They  out there?" Hub nods) How's it feel to be on the other end  of it?
7) 178) dialog: This is the endgame, you understand  that? If this goes wrong --
7) 180) dialog: We're the CIA, something always goes  wrong.
7) 182) dialog: I don't suppose there's any way you  would trust me to do this on my own? (off his look) I thought not. Well, in case it gets  hairy, remember... the most committed  wins.
7) 188) dialog: Shhhhhh... If you'd stop whining  you'd feel the surveillance.
7) 190) dialog: Wait for the light to turn yellow  and then cross against the traffic.
7) 199) dialog: Sit. (takes out a pocket- knife) Raise your arm.
7) 202) dialog: They cannot even dream we are being  followed, isn't that what you said?
7) 207) dialog: (with rising dread) ...They're going to hit the march.
7) 215) dialog: Here. Put this on. We don't want our  friends sweating too much while they  wait.
7) 245) dialog: "...sweating too much while they  wait."
8) 4) dialog: How soon are they coming?
8) 7) dialog: What are you doing --?
8) 11) dialog: I'll tell them when they're here.
8) 13) dialog: Nobody else is coming, is there?
8) 16) dialog: You're the last cell.
8) 21) dialog: How could I have missed the play --
8) 23) dialog: -- Just tell me we didn't finance  your operation...
8) 25) dialog: They're going to release him.
8) 27) dialog: A few months at most. First, they  have to bring him to trial, but --
8) 30) dialog: -- But... that's what you want, isn't  it? Why you've done all this --
8) 35) dialog: Samir, the Koran preaches --
8) 37) dialog: (with rising terror) But it's over, your point's been  made, why spill any more blood? Those  poor people out there in the street,  they're fucking marching for your  cause...
8) 43) dialog: NO --!!!
8) 45) dialog: DON'T --!!!!
8) 54) dialog: Shoot.
8) 56) dialog: Shoot.
8) 59) dialog: SHOOT ME --!!!
8) 61) dialog: YOU HAVE TO. (weeping now) You... promised...
8) 63) dialog: (sobbing) No --!!!
8) 73) dialog: Is... he... dead?
8) 75) dialog: (whispers) ...no... regrets...
8) 78) dialog: (the saddest smile) I... wondered.
8) 81) dialog: ... Emma... My name... is Emma.
