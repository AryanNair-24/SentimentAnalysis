He has trouble making ey contact- and sometimes it's hard to tell if he's talking or to himself. ERICA, also 19, is Mark's date. She has a girl-next-door that makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the conversation she already knows that she'd rather not be t and her politeness is about to be tested. The scene is stark and simple.

The starboard boat is being crewed b pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the "H" Harvard. We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing section. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at As -- the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, th blazers and brightly colored floral ties. But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. their own breathing as they pull against the longest natu straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half torture test against the best competition they've ever fa And they're neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can't shake Dutch. The CROWD is going crazy in their own English way as none them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this l Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent wav the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of Americans.
