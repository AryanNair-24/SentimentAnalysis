CAMERON

58) 7) text: Yes. He resented--Mark resented that they- --that your clients, probably thought he would jump at the chance to rehabilitate his image after the Facemash thing but Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything. With Facemash he'd beaten the Harvard computers, he'd beaten the Ad Board and he made the girls mad. Facemash did what he wanted it to do. MARK kind of nods a little to himself. It should be noted these depositions have an extra element of dish ort as everything is being said within a few feet of the peop" b talked about. GAGE

I went to my best friend for the money because he's who I wanted to be partners with because of our similar vision and his superior business skills. Eduardo was president of the Harvard Investors Association and he was my best friend.
