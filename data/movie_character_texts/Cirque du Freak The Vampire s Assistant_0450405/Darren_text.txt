23) 19) text: The night Steve came below to speak to me, you were there. Did you hear what we talked about? DARREN
23) 21) text: You don't just 'become' a vampire. The change is too extreme. And if the shock didn't kill you, your inexperience would. So you become one in stages. A half-vampire at first. With greater strength than a human, but still able to go out in sunlight. You learn from a full vampire. Do you understand? DARREN
23) 23) text: But your friend has bad blood. He's no good. There's no telling what he'll become as he matures. DARREN
23) 26) text: And yesterday you didn't believe in vampires. Regardless, I've left the Cirque. Left my protection. I need someone to protect me while I sleep. I need an apprentice. DARREN (SUDDENLY REALIZES)

23) 30) text: You hardly have a choice. It's your destiny. DARREN
23) 32) text: Try this then. You're reckless enough to steal, responsible enough to come back for a friend. That's enough for me. DARREN
23) 34) text: Yes, well, destiny can't be explained. It must be lived. Now, you're wasting my time. DARREN
23) 36) text: There isn't. DARREN
23) 39) text: And he slips away while we argue. Life or death? Yes or no? DARREN
23) 41) text: Yes or no? Thoughts rush, then stop. Darren finally just nods. Crepsley raises his right hand. The nails are not especia long, but they look thick and sharp. Crepsley takes Darren's hand, jabs at his forefinger, dra blood. He dabs off a drop, smells it, then tastes it. CREPSLEY
23) 43) text: Lift your hands. Darren does as he's told. Crepsley digs all ten nails int all ten of Darren's fingertips. Darren jerks back in pain CREPSLEY

25) 2) text: We're in time. He still has a few minutes left. Crepsley takes a small AMBER VIAL from his pocket. He bre a wax seal then pinches out a small blackened cork. He pulls the drip line out of the IV CATHETER and empties drop of the vial's dark, viscous contents inside. It swir murkily, coloring the liquid on its way into Steve's arm. A beat and then Steve seems to convulse, his arms and leg twitching. Is he dying? DARREN
25) 4) text: He was near death. The journey back is not pleasant. What do you know about him, this boy with bad blood? DARREN
25) 6) text: Hmm... Who's his father? DARREN
