Providing them with samples of your genetic material -- helping them with the Reaper program.  They're close, Blade.  Right up against it.  Any day now, they're all going to be Daywalkers. And when that happens, well, let's just say, I don't want to be on the losing team.  You may be strong, you may be fast, but in the end, you're just too human, B.
