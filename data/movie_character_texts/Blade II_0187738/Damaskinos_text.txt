A Borgia-esque Renaissance portr staring down at us with a severe gaze.  Towering over all these is a massive Greek Cross carved from stone.  MUSIC echoes around them -- Boito's Faust.  Standing in the mid of this is OVERLORD ELI DAMASKINOS, wearing a robe of bla silk.
33) 2) text: Damaskinos holds up his hand.  He waits for the music to crescendo, then turns, his face still hidden in shadow.

In the counterpoint this are a series of muted monitors tuned to the pulse of world -- CNN, MSNBC, C-SPAN, etc. Damaskinos sits in a robe, finishing a meal, his eyes flicking over the monitors -- tracking current events, ma fluctuations.  We get the sense that the man is a true polymath.  That he owes his five thousand-plus years of existence to resourcefulness rather than luck. Stevens enters, waiting to be acknowledged.

118) 7) text: Damaskinos slowly tightens his hand around Nyssa's throat
118) 8) dialog: I have fathered thousands of children in centuries since I first walked this earth.  Make no mistake, Nyssa.

(giving her an extra squeeze) If you have any interest in remaining alive, you would do well to remember that.

All eyes turn towards a steel security door which is shuddering -- bulging and bending inwards as Nomak throws himself against it. Damaskinos looks to a bank of security monitors which are flickering back to life now.  We see Nomak's blurred silhouette from various angles, pummeling the door.  Then RIPPPPPP!!!
