2) 7) dialog: ~ the last chapter. He stops writing for a moment, looks up, and we see his eyes. As a dying fire retains a heart of glowing coals, so does this man preserve in these eyes the fire of his dying life -- remarkable eyes, which are sometimes alert with intelligence, calm with resigned philosophy, spar- kling with mature and ironic humor, or touched with pain. He looks at the desert, the hills, the sea; bendsover to write.

8) 1) text: The building is being erected of great limestone blocks. We see ordinary WORKMEN who shape the stone with crude instruments and set the stones in place - but the focus of interest is a great sledge on which a huge block of stone is being transported. Forty SLAVES, hitched like oxen to the sledge, are trying to pull it up a wet-sanded ramp. OVERSEERS, who carry staffs as tall as themselves, do not hesitate to belabor the backs of the salves. Sinuhe, dressed in the clothing of a physician, stands watching.

8) 4) text: Sinuhe bends over the slave, examines him. He pushes back his eyelids, looks into dead eyes. He rises, shakes his head at those who have gathered around. There is no expression of horror on Sinuhe's face -~ this is the daily life of these people, not an isolated incident. Camera pulls back to widen angle as an indifferent Overseer shrugs, whacks the harness of the dead slave free with the slash of a large knife. Another Overseer, raising his staff -

18) 12) dialog: Don't you know you could have been killed! Akhnaton looks at him, his eyes burning with such inten- sity, that they seem almost mad. In a voice which has a strange, delicate, almost:feminine quality, and given an added strangeness by the choked intensity of his emotions he says:

18) 24) dialog: (still rather amused) At least I can see that he doesn't swallow his tongue. He tears astripof linen from his clothing, rolls it and inserts it into Akhnaton's mouth. At the same time Horemheb returns from the chariot bringing a small stone flask of water bound with reeds, which he uncorks and hands to Sinuhe. Sinuhe dampens another strip of linen with water and washes the young man's forehead,

In this manner she begins to serve the wine. Sinuhe stares at her. Deciding that this must be some game she has invented out of caprice, he opens hi cloak with a gesture which he thinks she cannot miss, dis playing Pharach's honors. Horemheb, alerted, sensing some thing, does the same. Not a reaction from Merit, her eyes on table and what she is doing. In consternation, sure now that this is a deliberate caprice, Sinuhe is put to the necessity of offering -
21) 13) dialog: Happy is the loveliness of the night. No response. In consternation Sinuhe throws a glance at Horemheb. Merit, finished with her business with the wine in a tone which plainly says that it is only the customar phrase of every serving girl to any customer -
21) 15) dialog: Merit! She stops, nothing more, refusing to resist the pressure of his hold on her clothing, but not making a move to turn.
21) 16) dialog: What foolishness is this?

21) 23) dialog: Is this some game?

We know the skill of curing blindness with a needle - the use of splints for broken bones - of salves to prevent wounds from festering - of drugs to induce false sleep so that men do not feel pain. Camera has pulled back to include the whole scene. Sinuhe is about to give a demonstration before fellow physicians and students. He is being assisted by another PHYSICIAN. Kaptah squats on the ground near him, eyeing his master with anxious distress. Sinuhe's thoughts are not with what he is saying; his thoughts are with Nefer.

He looks again at the sign he has brought in- side with him, his face bleak for a moment before he tosses the sign aside.
