45) 16) dialog: This tent is a military tent, severe. Its walls are hung with military maps. The tent is of medium size and is connected to an adjoining tent by means of a tented pas- sageway. Although we do not see the inside of this se- cond tent, the sounds of ringing metal which come from it suggest that it is a big field armorers' shop. Sit- ting on a camp chair is PRINCE SHUBBILULIUMA. He is a man of middle age who, though he wears a military uniform suggests a diplomat more than a commander. The group of his COMMANDERS who are around him, however, look like just what they are - and transplanted to the modern world would be Nazis or Soviets... The Prince is wearing a ban- dage slant-wise across an injured eye. Sinuhe is care- fully examining this eye, using a glass which magnifies. Kaptah is standing nearby looking around, his interest on the maps. There is silence until Sinuhe completes his examination. As he straightens up - PRINCE SHUBB. Can you make my eye whole again?
