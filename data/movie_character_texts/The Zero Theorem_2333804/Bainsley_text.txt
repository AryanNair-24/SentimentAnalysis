8) 70) dialog: You're staring at me. You think my dress is incredibly ugly.
8) 72) dialog: It's my daddy's fault. He used to buy me these incredibly ugly clothes to keep the boys away. Didn't work. Only made me want to get naked, and that's no way to keep the boys away. So I never developed a fashion sense. Are you on drugs?

20) 41) dialog: I prefer not to be manhandled. Regaining control, Qohen turns to her.
20) 43) dialog: In case you got the wrong idea, I should tell you I don't do sexual intercourse any more. I don't care if a guy wraps himself up like a latex mummy, nothing's going inside me. Way too dangerous. She shrugs it off, smiling slowly.
20) 44) dialog: I'm into bioteletantric interfacing now. It's smart and safe and -- oh my God! -- it feels so super-tingly! She spins away on a spiked heel, short dress flaring.

21) 11) dialog: I'm here to help, Qohen. Trust me. Confession's good for the soul.
21) 13) dialog: Everybody has a soul.
21) 15) dialog: So I saved your life for nothing...? Qohen wilts with guilt. 36.
21) 16) dialog: Come on, Qohen. How can I help if you won't tell me anything? Qohen meets her eyes then looks away. He takes a deep breath.

22) 2) dialog: What do you think? Joby said it's based on one of your projects. Qohen sits stiffly on his bed, staring doubtfully.
22) 4) dialog: Don't put it on your resume yet. Top secret. I'm the cyberspace test pilot. She pulls an identical and incredibly tiny-looking suit f a box, drapes it across Qohen's lap.

He takes a tentative nibble and, despite himself... shive with pleasure. He grabs the rest and fills his mouth.
25) 7) dialog: Good? Qohen looks at her, swallows, regains his reserve.
25) 9) dialog: All in your mind... from my mind. My father used to clip pictures from travel magazines and put them on the fridge.
