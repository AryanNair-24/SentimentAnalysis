73) 38) text: Glad you had a chance to meet Myrtle. Bertie stifles a snort. Elizabeth glares at him. LIONEL (CONT'D)
73) 40) text: Harley Street is far too public. What is my function here? LIONEL
73) 42) text: Oh dear, I may not be a `pitch in' type. LIONEL
73) 44) text: What?! LIONEL
73) 46) dialog: Breathe deeply...expand your chest... now your stomach...deep into the diaphragm. Splendid. How do you feel?
73) 48) dialog: Well on your way to becoming a qualified political speaker. Again... Bertie inhales deeply.
73) 49) dialog: ... and hold. Now, Princess Elizabeth, be so kind as to sit on your husband's stomach.
73) 51) dialog: Gently of course. Elizabeth sits gingerly on Bertie's stomach, asking solicitously:
73) 53) dialog: Now exhale slowly...down goes Princess Elizabeth...inhale slowly...nothing rushed, expanding your chest fully, extending the column of air til it hits the diaphragm...and...up comes Princess Elizabeth. Exhale...down goes Princess Elizabeth...inhale...up comes Princess Elizabeth. You get the idea. Doesn't have to be Princess Elizabeth of course, but I thought you'd prefer your wife to one of the staff. Now comes the fun part.
73) 55) dialog: You will now shout the vowel sounds, all five of them, as loudly as possible, each to last no less than 15 seconds. There's poor coordination between your larynx and diaphragm. Princess Elizabeth, you can be the official timer.
73) 57) dialog: Anyone who can stand at an open window vibrating loudly in full view of the world can learn to give a public speech.
73) 61) dialog: (startled) You're followed?
74) 2) dialog: No. The unhappy meal continues. PETER

74) 8) text: Lionel...without warning, I arrive home to find the Queen in my parlour. LIONEL
74) 10) text: Lionel, don't quibble! LIONEL
74) 12) text: Does it matter!? She's the Queen and he's the King forgodsake! What're they doing here?! LIONEL
74) 17) dialog: When that poor chap first walked into my office, he was a slim, quiet man with tired eyes and all the outward symptoms of the person upon whom a habitual speech defect has set the sign. You saw him today; once more there was hope.
74) 19) dialog: Myrtle, I love you.
74) 22) dialog: Myrtle... I don't deserve a wonderful woman like you.
74) 24) dialog: But why'd you come home so early?
74) 27) dialog: (anguished) Why?!
74) 29) dialog: Oh, Myrtle. My love...
75) 35) text: Something...discreet...private. We could pre-record an edited version to be broadcast to the world. Or even find an actor with a similar voice. Logue has arrived and comes out of the shadows. LIONEL
75) 38) text: You mean my bodyguard,"Crusher?" Giving Lionel a scathing look, Lang continues speaking to confidentially. COSMO LANG
75) 39) text: Fret not. As I assured our nation in my recent broadcast: "When his people listen to their new Monarch they will note an occasional momentary hesitation in his speech. But to those who hear it, it need cause no sort of embarrassment, for it causes none to him who speaks." You see, I've paved the way. But should you wish to avoid further stress... LIONEL

75) 47) text: Impossibly to find room. Even for a Doctor. LIONEL
75) 48) text: Just Lionel. BERTIE
75) 54) text: I'll have someone attend to it. LIONEL
75) 56) text: My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey! The Church must make preparations. LIONEL
75) 58) text: Bertie?! We do not call the King: "Bertie"! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 LIONEL
75) 61) text: You've made a dangerous enemy. LIONEL
75) 63) text: And don't ever call me Bertie in public. A moment of confrontation.    Lionel knows he's overstepp
75) 64) dialog: Tell me... BERTIE
75) 65) text: I sense one of your dreadful questions on the horizon. LIONEL
75) 67) text: Knew it! I haven't any choice. LIONEL
75) 69) text: What's this, you wait til Westminster Abbey, then ambush me? LIONEL
75) 71) text: I'm a sacrificial lamb being led to slaughter! Damn you! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 LIONEL
75) 75) text: That's quite different. Let's get down to work then, shall we? Bertie glares at him. LIONEL (CONT'D)
75) 76) text: As soon as you and Elizabeth enter the West door, you'll be greeted with the hymn "I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me." You won't actually be that glad, because they sing it for a great long time. Bertie follows Logue deep into the bowels of the `Abbey'. LIONEL (CONT'D)
75) 80) text: Like my father. LIONEL

77) 6) dialog: You must.
77) 8) dialog: Royal Box. You and I. Stunned silence, then.
77) 10) dialog: Rather thought you might. Valentine calls from the next room: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08
77) 12) dialog: Won't be a sec.
78) 2) text: He exits. THE CAMERA explores various elements: The Throne of Edward the Confessor. Beneath it, a large rough-hewn stone: The Stone Of Scone. Leaning against the Throne, a huge sword, set there for t Coronation rehearsal. Majestic stained glass windows of saints, kings, and mart Rows of pews, worn with centuries of use. Graves of the mighty: kings, poets, and statesmen. This Abbey holds the history of a nation. Footsteps resonate. Lionel enters.   Trips over one of the gravestones.
78) 3) dialog: Bertie? Blast! Stepped on Lord Byron. Bertie...?
78) 4) text: Lights snap on skewering Lionel. Bertie steps into view w a coat against the night chill of the stone cathedral.

78) 8) text: (barely controlled) "Just call me Lionel"! Never did you call yourself `Doctor'. We did that for you. No diploma, no training, no credentials. Just a great deal of nerve. LIONEL
78) 10) text: There isn't a "your-side-of-the-story". This is my story. And you've ruined it! Its not just the Coronation, terrifying enough, its the radio speech to millions afterwards, and the speech after that, and for the rest of my failed miserable life! LIONEL
78) 12) text: You dare remind me?! LIONEL
78) 14) text: Then you knew from the start I was hopeless?! LIONEL
78) 16) text: Lying bastard! LIONEL

78) 22) text: Actor? LIONEL
78) 24) text: An actor?! LIONEL
78) 25) text: When the war came, by the time I was ready to be shipped out, the first casualties were limping home. Poor buggers, broken in bone and spirit. `Lionel, you're good with your mouth, see if you can help these poor sods.' The shell-shocked were the saddest. Most stuttered profoundly. Far worse than you. Muscle therapy helped somewhat, but I found I had to go deeper, as you might well imagine. BERTIE
78) 26) text: I know nothing of those poor men! LIONEL
78) 28) text: I suppose that helped them, did it? LIONEL
78) 30) text: Inquiries have been made! No credentials. LIONEL

78) 33) text: Not in Western Australia, not at that time. I simply knew what to do. When the war was over I kept being a therapist to earn a living. When the lads were old enough, I thought, "Alright Lionel, you've always wanted to be an actor, one last go." I pretended it was our trip home to Mother England, the Great Australian Pilgrimage. BERTIE
78) 34) text: To Harley Street?! LIONEL
78) 36) text: So you set yourself up on Harley Street as an actor? Harley Street, don't you know, is for doctors! LIONEL
78) 38) text: Well enough to deceive me. LIONEL
78) 40) text: I would if I could! LIONEL
78) 42) text: You've saddled this nation in its moment of peril with a voiceless King. Destroyed the happiness of my family...all for the sake of ensnaring a star client you knew you couldn't possibly assist! Lionel sits down on the chair of Edward the Confessor. Le against it is the great two-handed sword of St. George. BERTIE (CONT'D)
78) 43) text: What're you doing? Get up! TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    1 LIONEL
78) 45) text: You can't sit there! LIONEL
78) 47) text: It's the Chair of Edward The Confessor! The throne upon which every King for six and a half centuries has been crowned. LIONEL
78) 49) text: That's the Stone of Scone! The Stone of Destiny that was once Jacob's pillow. LIONEL
78) 51) text: Listen to me... ! LIONEL
78) 53) text: Divine right, if you must! I'm your King!!! LIONEL

78) 59) text: Stop trying to squirm off the hook. LIONEL
78) 71) dialog: In hushed tones the BBC commentator paints a picture for the world, as you stand at the altar divested of your robes. Trumpets echo through the Abbey. The incessant rain clears miraculously as a shaft of sun streams through the stained-glass window catching your golden tunic and bathing you in light like a mediaeval knight. And you are King! The faint CLICKING WHIR of a film projector is heard.
80) 2) dialog: Try again.
80) 4) dialog: Turn the halts into pauses, during which you say to yourself, "God save the King".
80) 6) dialog: Use the silence. Long pauses add solemnity to great occasions.
80) 9) text: If I am to be King...where is my power? May I form a Government on my own, appoint or dismiss a Prime Minister, chose an Ambassador, levy a tax or declare a war? None of these things. Yet I am the seat of all authority. Why? Because the Nation believes when I speak, I speak for them. Yet I cannot speak! Logue totally ignores the outburst. LIONEL
80) 12) dialog: Go on... BERTIE
80) 13) text: The letter`P' is always difficult. LIONEL
80) 16) dialog: Beaut. BERTIE

80) 25) text: I prefer pipes. LIONEL
80) 27) text: "For the second time... in the lives of most of us... we are at war." One-two- three. (continues on) "Over and over again... we have tried to find a peaceful way... out of the differences... between ourselves... and those who are now our enemies." Bugger, bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck! LIONEL
80) 30) dialog: Of course. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   10 Bertie holds out his hand, demandingly. Somewhat hurt, Li hands it over.
80) 33) dialog: Willie! Where's your mum?
80) 35) dialog: You've been waiting here, alone, all this time?
80) 38) dialog: Did you?
80) 40) dialog: He did.
80) 42) dialog: Would you like to sing, dance, and shout rude words?
80) 44) dialog: Why am I not surprised?
81) 8) text: Bertie, do make sure that's not switched on! LIONEL
81) 10) text: They'll bloody well have to listen to me anyway. Right? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    1 LIONEL
81) 15) text: No matter how this turns out, I wish to thank you. For asking such dreadful questions. What can I do in recompense? LIONEL
81) 17) text: Sorry. That would raise too many questions. LIONEL
81) 19) text: Your shilling. Told you I'd give it back. LIONEL
81) 22) text: Made from the melted coin. Designed it myself, hope you like it, Lionel old friend. May I call you that? LIONEL
84) 8) text: Well done, Bertie. Well done... (for the first time) ...Lionel. Well done. She leaves the two men together. LIONEL
