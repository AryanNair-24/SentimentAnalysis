Again, there are three "indoor" cages flanking each side of the entrance; and only the middle cage in the RIGHT- hand sector -- containing the as yet unseen CORNELIUS and ZIRA -- is lit by a single hanging electric bulb which faintly illuminates the entire scene. From the shadows STEVIE runs, relieved, to LEWIS and ARMANDO. Cont. 234 78 113 Cont.
