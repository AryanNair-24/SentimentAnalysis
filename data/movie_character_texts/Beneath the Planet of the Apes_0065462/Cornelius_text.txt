Then with a whoosh! the entire AUDIENCE rises to its feet except for CHAIRMAN, who collapses in his seat. ZIRA, still chuckling, resumes hers. So, under LEWIS's pacifying gestures, does the AUDIENCE. Except for one.

Inside, the radio is broadcasting a variety program, whose (filtered) voices louden as CORNELIUS draws near: “WIFE" Honey, our doctor says I need making love to at least five times a week.
30) 43) dialog: She is ... sleeping? He touches her. She doesn't move.
30) 44) dialog: (alarmed) Zira! Still no movement. He shakes her -- almost roughly.
30) 45) dialog: (louder) Zira! She stirs and opens dog-tired eyes. He sighs with momentary relief. Then:
30) 46) dialog: Zira, I killed him.
30) 48) dialog: The Orderly at the Camp. He's dead. I hetrd it spoken over the air. She sits up, frightened.
30) 49) dialog: Everybody's hunting for us, Zira. She begins piteously to moan and whimper. He holds her head against his chest, but the whimpering continues. Suddenly:

33) 0) text: Dim and shadowy, for the audience has long gone home. Again, there are three "indoor" cages flanking each side of the entrance; and only the middle cage in the RIGHT- hand sector -- containing the as yet unseen CORNELIUS and ZIRA -- is lit by a single hanging electric bulb which faintly illuminates the entire scene. From the shadows STEVIE runs, relieved, to LEWIS and ARMANDO. Cont. 234 78 113 Cont.
33) 17) dialog: Lewis! (striding urgently to bars) I was not responsible for the death --

36) 2) dialog: I'm an archeologist. I can even draw one. LEWIS lets map unroll over the back of his seat, where CORNELIUS (on his stomach) can read it.
37) 10) dialog: Lewis.
37) 12) dialog: If they find us, we shall be killed?
37) 14) dialog: Then give us the chance to kill ourselves when ... if the moment comes. A long beat, in which LEWIS's hand goes to his pocket ».-. and stays there.
37) 18) dialog: (diffidently to Stevie) And you're the first. He kisses STEVIE, whose eyes are wet; then grabs ZIRA, almost harshly, by the hand.
37) 19) dialog: Come along, Zira! Don't dawdle! He hauls her off unceremoniously into the swallowing darkness, leaving LEWIS and STEVIE (their backs to us) watching them recede. We ZOOM TO:
37) 26) dialog: We're over the hill. (taking bearings from the stars) Now we go west. (over-optimistically) This'll be easier. Take Milo and keep behind me. I want to be sure all's clear. They begin:
37) 32) dialog: (helping her up and taking Baby) Are you all right?
37) 34) dialog: Then let's get going. (looking about) We made a bit of noise. As they recede westwards into the darkness, we PULL BACK to include base of derrick with the shred of ZIRA's dress still attached to a lower girder. Then we SLOW-ZOOM FORWARD to:

40) 16) dialog: Lowering Lewis's pistol. On SOUND, we reprise CRESCENDO MUSIC mimicking the high-string "scream" in his head (which he heard when he knew he had killed the Orderly) and we HOLD "scream" until he speaks. Now he staggers dumbly up the swaying, clattering gangway crosses the cluttered deck to the seaward rail, and clamb up the catwalk companionway to:

40) 44) dialog: (looking down gangway) You can't break my heart any more. You broke it when... He pitches forward. The gangway clatters as he slides down it, face foremost, until his dead cheek touches ZIRA's.
