4) 30) dialog: It’s all happening. I got married. Stacy’s pregnant-- with triplets! And I finally got my sex offender status expunged.

SLOCUM’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER Dale pulls into the parking lot, passing a sign that read “DR. HARLEN SLOCUM, PEDIATRIC DENTIST” above an image of cartoon TOOTH having its own tooth pulled by another TOOT dressed as a dentist.

6) 0) text: Dale enters to find a 4 YEAR-OLD BOY, GABE, hollering miserably as DR. SLOCUM, 80’s, sits slumped asleep with dental tools still inside Gabe’s open mouth.

6) 4) dialog: (to Gabe) You're okay, buddy. (checking) Nothing bleeding here.
6) 6) dialog: Okay. Bathroom’s down the hall.
6) 8) dialog: Where’s your mommy?

7) 8) dialog: (mumbling) It’s just that I recently had something expunged from my record. It was a big misunderstanding. Empty playground. No kids anywhere. But I really shouldn’t be doing this... He gets the pants open and heads for the door.
7) 9) dialog: Okay. You’re good to go. I’1l wait outside.
7) 11) dialog: What?! No one’s taught you how to aim? Gabe shakes his head.

7) 14) dialog: I’m gonna go to jail! Gabe does a desperate pee pee dance.
7) 16) dialog: Aw man. You’re really gonna make me do this? (sighs) All right. Let’s get it over with. Dale takes a latex glove from his dental scrubs and pulls on his hand. With his arm outstretched and looking the ot way, he helps Gabe aim (off-screen). We hear the sound of peeing.
7) 17) dialog: There you go. (to himself) This is not a good situation.

8) 3) dialog: You’re welcome. (beat) Now, you don’t necessarily have to tell your mom that I helped you pee. It can be our secret. (quickly) Not a secret.

SLOCUM’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER Dale peers through the blinds and sees Gabe getting in a with his MOTHER. 11. The car pulls out of its parking spot and drives forward fifty feet or so, then SCREECHES to a halt, SLAMS into reverse and ZOOMS back into the parking lot.

10) 2) dialog: There weren't “dicks.” It was just one. You make it sound like it was a boys choir! 12.
10) 6) dialog: What was I supposed to do? Let the kid piss in his pants?

10) 10) dialog: Very funny.
10) 12) dialog: Pregnant. Very pregnant. I don’t think the human body is designed to carry three babies.
10) 14) dialog: No! Of course not. It’s beautiful. (off their looks) It’s a little gross. She’s got this weird line that runs down her belly.
10) 17) dialog: I like olives.
10) 19) dialog: But I like ‘em.
10) 23) dialog: Yeah, what was wrong with our old bar?
10) 26) dialog: And that bathroom attendant expects me to pay him for paper towels, so I can’t even wash my hands. Kurt and Nick grimace as Dale roots through the olive dis

11) 7) dialog: Wait. Let’s see what Denny has to say.
11) 14) dialog: He’s not wrong.
12) 1) dialog: All I’m saying is, Denny Paul has a point. I thought that when I went to work for Dr. Slocum I’d be happier. But my job still kinda sucks.
12) 4) dialog: What? No! I just mean, maybe the problem wasn’t working for our old bosses. Maybe the problem is working for anyone.

12) 13) dialog: Buying him a drink.
12) 16) dialog: We really enjoyed your seminar--
12) 22) dialog: I’m Dale. This is Nick and Kurt. We were just talking about how great it would be to be our own bosses.
12) 26) dialog: How did you do it, Denny? Did you follow your own fifteen steps? Denny looks at them and considers for a beat.
12) 32) dialog: So, what do we do? Tell us?

12) 56) dialog: (holding up business card) I think we should seriously consider this venture capital thing.
12) 67) dialog: That's a stupid idea. (beat) It should be a non-stick spray for your balls, like Pam.
12) 70) dialog: Ooh, that just gave me an idea. A condom in a spray can. It goes on as a liquid, and then it hardens into a solid.
12) 74) dialog: It’ll come with an antidote spray. Some kind of acid. That’s for our lab guys to figure out.
12) 77) dialog: Maybe Nick’s right. Maybe we need to focus more on vagina inventions.
12) 79) dialog: Okay, here’s an everyday problem: showering. You gotta shampoo, condition, lather up, rinse, repeat. It takes forever. There’s a beat.
12) 81) dialog: I don’t know. I thought we were just talking about problems.
12) 84) dialog: Right? I bet the average person loses a day every week just showering. 24.
12) 87) dialog: Yeah! You could turn a dial to choose what you want it to spray. Like those Miracle-Gro things you attach to a garden hose.
13) 2) dialog: Try Bed, Bath & Beyond. They’ve got everything. Kurt does.
13) 4) dialog: So, should we call that venture capital guy?
13) 6) dialog: How about... the Shower Buddy? 25.
13) 8) dialog: I don’t know why you go right to “gay.” (types on laptop) Let’s see what comes up under “Shower Buddy.” They all cringe and recoil at what appears on screen.
13) 9) dialog: Okay, that’s pretty gay. But it’s not a product.
13) 12) dialog: Ow!
13) 19) dialog: What about our Shower Buddy? Rhonda looks confused. Kurt herds Nick and Dale toward th door.
13) 21) dialog: I don’t think it’s silly. I think it could be the key to our vision life.

NAGOPIAN’S OFFICE - LATER Dale sits on a couch in a well-appointed office and finis his pitch to someone offscreen. Beside him stands an ease with his Shower Buddy sketch tacked to it.
16) 1) dialog: The Shower Buddy eliminates the endless cycle of washing and rinsing and washing and rinsing. It’s not just a time saver. It’s a life saver. My team is ready to move on this with or without your help. But the only way we can do that is with your help. REVERSE ON ALEX NAGOPIAN, 40's, well dressed, confident a slightly intimidating (think Liam Neeson). Beside him sit JOYCE, 30's, an attractive colleague. Nagopian considers Dale's pitch for a beat.

16) 11) dialog: They’re very busy men. We all are. Very busy. Men.

16) 15) dialog: Do you have a piece of paper?

16) 32) dialog: Nope.
17) 0) text: Dale sits at a desk in another room as Joyce places a lar stack of documents in front of him.

18) 0) text: Two pages into the stack, Dale is BORED OUT OF HIS MIND a fighting to stay awake.
18) 1) dialog: Okay, this all looks good. He flips to the last page and in an INSERT we see him sig first his own name, then forge the signatures of “Nick Hendricks” and “Kurt Buckman.”

19) 16) dialog: No. It’s a real check. From the venture capital place Denny Paul used. I pitched them the Shower Buddy and they loved it!
19) 18) dialog: They said it filled a niche.
19) 21) dialog: Because I knew you didn’t believe in the Buddy like I did. Nick gets up.
19) 23) dialog: Where are you going? Nick points across the street at a bank.
19) 29) dialog: Told you!
19) 32) dialog: What?!
19) 40) dialog: Yeah, Nick. This could be a whole new start.

20) 18) dialog: .--but I wanted to tell you in person anyway. So... (getting up) -+-guess I’m just gonna... go. He quietly opens the door to the office, but it stops halfway, banging into something in the hall.
