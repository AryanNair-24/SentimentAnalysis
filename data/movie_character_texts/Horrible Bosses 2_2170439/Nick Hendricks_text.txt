1) 1) dialog: I put in a lot of years to become president of Comnindyne and now I’m earning a lot more and working a lot... more. The strange thing is, when I finally made it to the top, I realized that I’d actually only made it to the bottom of the top. Nick heads toward the building, passing several parking s with much more expensive sports cars (Ferrari, Porsche 91 Turbo, Mercedes SLR McLaren) each with a sign bearing a n and the title “PRESIDENT.”

10) 5) dialog: Yeah, feels like two strikes is enough.
10) 7) dialog: Yeah./Uh huh.
10) 11) dialog: How’s Stacy feeling?
10) 16) dialog: Dale, that’s your fourth bowl of olives.
10) 18) dialog: Just because they keep bringing them doesn’t mean you have to keep wolfing them down.

10) 38) dialog: It’s more complicated than that.
10) 40) dialog: Yeah. We stay on NICK. It’s pretty clear that he is not happy. From the hallway outside the bar, they suddenly hear MUSI blaring over a loudspeaker. It’s “I GOTTA FEELING” by The Black Eyed Peas, accompanied by CHEERING from what sounds like a decent-sized crowd. 15.

12) 48) dialog: (looking around nervously) Does she still have that cat?
12) 50) dialog: Good. Nick sits on the sofa. As he does, a CAT leaps onto his shoulder from behind with a YOWL and darts away.
12) 51) dialog: What the hell?! You said he ran away.
12) 53) dialog: What, does she rescue them from a haunted house? Kurt pours drinks from a wet bar and they all sit. Dale s his drink on the table.
12) 55) dialog: (to Kurt) Who are you?
12) 57) dialog: They don’t just hand you money, Dale. You need to pitch them a good business idea.
12) 59) dialog: Could be.
12) 61) dialog: (dubious) Do you?
12) 63) dialog: Um...
12) 65) dialog: No one’s gonna fund that.

19) 6) dialog: Oh, Dale. I’m so sorry. How’s Stacy doing?
19) 10) dialog: So you dragged us out here to tell us your babies are fine?
19) 14) dialog: What-- what are we looking at here, Dale?
19) 19) dialog: Let me see that. He grabs the check and examines it.

19) 31) dialog: (to Dale) You need to return this.
19) 34) dialog: No one hands you a million dollars without there being a catch. This is too good to be true.
19) 36) dialog: (checks watch) I’m going to be late for work. He turns to go but Kurt stops him.

19) 41) dialog: If I quit, the ten years of hard work I put in at Comndiyne will have been for nothing.

20) 12) dialog: With all due respect, guys, I just don’t respect any of you. And I really don’t want to turn into you. He suddenly stops loading his case.
20) 13) dialog: What am I doing? I don’t need any of this. I’ve got my Shower Buddy now. See ya. He dumps the files out, shuts his case and exits. There’s stunned silence, then

The subject cautiously inspe the device and suddenly the shower head bursts in his fac again. 39. -- Our guys follow the bruised and pissed off subject to car, apologizing profusely. They manage to convince him t go back into the building. -- Fearing for his life, the same subject gingerly turns the shower which has a new model Shower Buddy installed.

32) 10) dialog: So far, so good. We've got a big pitch lined up. Could be great for-
32) 12) dialog: Re-what, now?
32) 14) dialog: Loan? You made a capital investment. Didn’t you take a ten percent stake in the company?
32) 16) dialog: Shower Buddy.
32) 18) dialog: Then why did you invest in it?
32) 20) dialog: I think there’s been a misunderstanding-- (pushing his intercom) (MORE )
32) 22) dialog: Jennifer, can you get Dale and Kurt in here, please?
32) 24) dialog: So what is this? Some kind of scam?
32) 26) dialog: There’s no way we can make a payment like that by tomorrow. The money you gave us is all invested in the company.
32) 28) dialog: Are you threatening us?
32) 30) dialog: That’s a threat!
32) 37) dialog: All right, you know what? This is the stupidest shakedown ever. If we die, how are we going to pay you back?

Dale signed papers saying that tomorrow we owe him two million bucks backed up with life insurance policies. If we don’t pay, we die. Kurt turns to Dale and looks at him for a moment. Then he also smacks him across the face.
32) 57) dialog: I knew I shouldn’t have listened to you guys. I gave up my career for this.
32) 59) dialog: Basically. Ghoukas definitely did.
32) 62) dialog: And tell them what? That Nagopian handed us perfectly legal loan documents which you forged our signatures on? All that does is send you to prison.
32) 66) dialog: I’m fine with it, too. But as far as Nagopian’s concerned, we still stole a million dollars from him. You don’t think Ghoukas is going to kill us?
32) 68) dialog: (to Kurt) If we liquidated everything right now, how much cash would we have?
32) 70) dialog: That means we have three days to come up with 1.7 million dollars. 49.

39) 2) dialog: Five.
40) 1) dialog: Detective, if you go, we’re as good as dead.
40) 9) dialog: I don’t understand. If Quiznos was the first tenant, how was Nagopian’s office there? 64.
40) 12) dialog: Let’s figure it out in the car. There’s no point standing out here in the rain.
40) 15) dialog: Maybe we should all stay together tonight! Might be safer!
40) 17) dialog: Kurt, your apartment is probably the most secure!
41) 1) dialog: It’s good that you locked it. They head for the stairs to Kurt’s loft.
