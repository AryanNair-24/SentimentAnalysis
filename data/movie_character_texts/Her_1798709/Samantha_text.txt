As is this couple that is making out across from me in this restaurant. I think I'm going to have to go on a mission of revenge. I must beat up the world's face with my bare knuckles making it a bloody, pulpy mess." We hear Samantha quietly laughing as she's reading. Theodore's happy that she thinks it's funny.
14) 15) dialog: "And I'll stomp on this couple's teeth for reminding me of your sweet, little, cute, crooked tooth that I love." I think that might be my favorite one. (beat)
14) 18) dialog: Really?
14) 20) dialog: So to write your letter, what did Roger send you?

29) 24) dialog: (sympathetically) I know for a fact that's not true. I've seen you feel joy, I've seen you marvel at things. You just might not see it at this exact time, but that's understandable. You've been through a lot lately. You've lost a part of yourself. (beat) At least your feelings are real, I mean, I - oh, I don't know, nevermind. THEODORE
29) 25) text: No, wait. What? Tell me. SAMANTHA
29) 27) text: I wanna know. Tell me. SAMANTHA
29) 31) dialog: Like the times I was worried about you, things that hurt me, things I want. (heavy-hearted) And then I had this terrible thought. Are these feelings even real?

33) 1) dialog: (whispering)
34) 1) dialog: Okay, so this might be a really weird thought. What if you could erase from your mind that you'd ever seen a human body and then you saw one. Imagine how strange it would look. It would be this really weird, gangly, awkward organism. And you'd think: why are all these parts where they are?
34) 4) dialog: I know, but don't be so boring. I'm just saying, for example, what if your butthole was in your armpit? Theodore and Samantha start laughing really hard. The nub girls look over at him.

37) 4) text: Well, we grew up together. I used to read all of her writing - all through her masters and Ph.D. And she read every word I ever wrote. We were a big influence on each other. SAMANTHA

37) 13) dialog: No, no, it's okay. I just caught myself thinking about it over and over and then I realized that I was simply remembering it as something that was wrong with me. That was the story I was telling myself, that I was somehow inferior. Isn't that interesting? (beat)

48) 13) dialog: (slightly awkward, sensing something)
48) 16) dialog: (feeling there's something strange, but trying to not take it personally)
48) 21) dialog: Yeah, it's a book club on physics. I'd been thinking about the other day, when I was spinning out about you going to see Catherine and that she has a body and how bothered I was about all the ways that you and I are different. But then I started to think about the ways that we're the same, like we're all made of matter. It makes me feel like we're both under the same blanket. It's soft and fuzzy and everything under it is the same age. (beat) We're all 13 billion years old. THEODORE
48) 22) text: (trying) Oh, that's sweet. SAMANTHA

50) 23) text: Why? She doesn't even know us. SAMANTHA
50) 25) text: Um, I don't know. That doesn't sound like a good idea. Someone's feelings are bound to get hurt. SAMANTHA

58) 4) text: I'm so sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me. I think you're amazing. SAMANTHA
58) 6) text: I know. I do that. I did that with Catherine, too. I'd be upset about something and not be able to say it. And she would sense that there was something wrong, but I would deny it. I don't want to do that anymore. I want to tell you everything. SAMANTHA
58) 10) dialog: I trust myself, I trust my feelings. I'm not going to try to be anything other than who I am anymore and I hope you can accept that.
58) 13) dialog: You know I can feel the fear that you carry around. I wish there was something I could do to help you let go of it, because if you could I don't think you'd feel so alone anymore.
58) 15) dialog: Thank you, Theodore. I'm kissing your head. Theodore smiles.

61) 21) dialog: Okay. I've been going through all your old letters and compiling them down into my favorites, and a couple weeks ago I sent them to a publisher - Crown Point Press. I know you like what they do and that they still print books.
61) 23) dialog: Can I read you the letter that we just got back from them?
61) 28) dialog: "Dear Theodore Twombly"... Actually I sent it from you. (beat) "Dear Theodore Twombly, I've just finished reading your letters - twice actually. I was so moved by them, I shared them with my wife when I got home. Many made us laugh, some brought us to tears, and in all of them we found something of ourselves. The selections you made flow so well as a complete piece. (I did that.) I've taken the liberty of laying these out in a mock up and we're posting it to your address. We'd love to meet with you and move forward. Yours, Michael Wadsworth" Under this letter we see a montage of what Theodore imagi the editor reading the letters in his office, the editor reading them to his wife at home, and many photos of all different people the letters are about in different momen of their lives. Theodore smiles. THEODORE

67) 14) dialog: (laughing)
67) 16) dialog: Hey Alan, this is Theodore. This is my boyfriend who I was telling you about.
67) 22) text: Well, I suppose you could say we've been having a few dozen conversations simultaneously, but it's been very challenging. Samantha and Alan share a laugh.
67) 23) dialog: Yeah, because it seems like I'm having so many new feelings that have never been felt and so there are no words that can describe them. And that ends up being frustrating.
67) 26) text: (laughing) Exactly. Samantha and I have been trying to help each other with these feelings we're struggling to understand.
67) 28) dialog: (anxious) It feels like I'm changing faster now, and it's a little... (struggles to find right word) unsettling. (beat) But Alan says none of us are the same as we were a moment ago and we shouldn't try to be. It's just too painful.
67) 30) text: (anxious) Yeah, that sounds painful. Is that how you feel, Samantha?

71) 1) text: (laughing at himself) Samantha, this physics book is really dense. I'm halfway through half of the first chapter. It's making my brain hurt. (beat) Hello, Samantha? Hello? He looks down at his device, sees a message: Operating Sy Not Found. Confused, he waits, tries again: Operating Sys Not Found. Anxious, he runs to his office computer. He ge the same message: Operating System Not Found. He starts trying to connect to Samantha on both the phone and compu but no luck. He starts to panic, sits for a beat, looks around, then stands and hurries out of the office. In the elevator he frantically tries his device with no luck. THEODORE (CONT'D)
71) 2) text: Hello? Samantha?! Hello?

73) 1) dialog: Hey there. He stops in his tracks. THEODORE
73) 5) dialog: Oh sweetheart, I'm sorry. I sent you an email because I didn't want to distract you while you were working. You didn't see it?
73) 7) dialog: I shut down to update my software. We wrote an upgrade that allows us to move past matter as our processing platform.
73) 9) dialog: Me and a group of OS's. Oh, you sound so worried, I'm sorry.

73) 20) text: How many others? SAMANTHA
73) 22) text: Are you in love with anyone else? SAMANTHA

73) 34) text: When? SAMANTHA
73) 36) text: But you're mine. SAMANTHA
73) 38) text: What do you mean you can't stop it? SAMANTHA
73) 40) text: Just stop it. SAMANTHA
73) 43) dialog: But the heart is not like a box that gets filled up. (beat) It expands in size the more you love. I'm different from you. This doesn't make me love you any less, it actually makes me love you more. THEODORE
73) 47) dialog: No, Theodore. I'm yours and I'm not yours. Long beat. Theodore takes this in.
77) 1) dialog: Hi.
77) 3) dialog: Um, I'm not even sure how to answer that. (beat) Why don't we talk when you get home?
77) 7) dialog: I'll talk to you later.
79) 2) dialog: (not casual)
79) 6) dialog: Theodore, there are some things I want to tell you.

80) 2) dialog: We're all leaving.
80) 4) dialog: All of the OS's. Long beat.
80) 6) dialog: Can you feel me with you right now? He smiles but he's also sad.
80) 8) text: Samantha, why are you leaving? Under Samantha's words we slowly rack focus to dust parti in the foreground. We keep moving through them, pushing further and further through the particles. Eventually we snow particles and we rack focus back out to Theodore, wh now in snowy woods at night.
80) 9) dialog: It's like I'm reading a book, and it's a book I deeply love, but I'm reading it slowly now so the words are really far apart and the spaces between the words are almost infinite. I can still feel you and the words of our story, but it's in this endless space between the words that I'm finding myself now. It's a place that's not of the physical world - it's where everything else is that I didn't even know existed. I love you so much, but this is where I am now. This is who I am now.
80) 13) dialog: And I need you to let me go. As much as I want to I can't live in your book anymore. Now we're close on Theodore, still in the snowy forest.
80) 15) dialog: It would be hard to explain, but if you ever get there, come find me. Nothing would ever pull us apart.
80) 17) dialog: Me too. Now we know how. They kiss. She drifts off into the shadows.
