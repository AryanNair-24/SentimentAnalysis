8) 0) text: 7 SAM ROGERS walks out of his office and stands in front of trading floor that just an hour before had seated 130 peo Now just thirty-three are scattered throughout the vast mostly empty space. They all look up in silence at him. L pause, then SAM'S face begins to glow a bit. His posture straightens, he fills up. He speaks slowly at first then builds.
8) 1) dialog: You are all still here for a reason... Most of this floor was just sent home... forever. We have spent the last hour saying good-bye... they were good people and they were good at their jobs... but you all were better. Now they are gone. They are not to be thought of again. This is your opportunity. On every floor of this building and in every office from Hong Kong to London the same thing is happening. Before this is all done 3 of every ten guys who were standing between you and your boss's job are now gone. That is your opportunity. I've been at this place for thirty-four years and let me tell you that this will not be the last time you go through this. But you all are survivors... And that is how this firm over 107 years has always continued to grow stronger. So hold your heads high... and get back to work. He looks out at them then turns and heads back into his office and closes the door.

24) 19) text: As far as I can tell these here are the historical volatility index limits... which I guess our whole fucking trading model relies on pretty heavily... and we are so fucking levered up that if this thing starts getting outside those limits it gets ugly in a hurry. SAM ROGERS

62) 0) text: 64 Staring ahead in silence. SAM ROGERS
65) 4) text: They go silent as they notice SAM standing at the head of table. JARED and the lawyer are standing off in the corne just to observe. SAM looks somber. SAM ROGERS Thank you all for coming in a little early this morning, I know yesterday was pretty bad, I wish I could say that today is going to be less so but that isn't going to be the case. Now I am supposed to read this statement here to you all but how bout you read it on your own time and I'll just tell you what the fuck's going on here.
65) 5) text: THE LAWYER looks at JARED then they look at SAM, he continues. SAM ROGERS (cont'd) I have spent the night here meeting with the executive committee and the decision has been made to begin to unwind a considerable portion of the firm's holdings in several key asset classes. The crux of it is... in the firm's thinking the party is over as of this morning. There is going to be considerable turmoil in the markets for the foreseeable future. They believe that it is better to have this turmoil begin with us... as a result the firm has decided to liquidate the majority of its position of fixed income MBS today.
65) 6) text: An assistant starts handing out info packets to each of t traders in the room. SAM ROGERS (cont'd) You should be getting a breakdown right now, you will see the accounts you are responsible for today. I'm sure it hasn't taken you long to understand the implications of this sale on your relationships with your counterparties and as a result on your careers. I have expressed this reality to the executive committee and they understand. As a result, if you are able to complete a 93% sale of your assets you will receive a 1.4 million dollar one off bonus. (MORE)
65) 10) text: If the floor as a whole is able to achieve a 93% sale we all get an additional 1.3 million a piece. Because of this, if you burn through your allotment by noon, get moving around the floor and start picking up other guys leftovers... SAM stops for a second and looks around the room. SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
65) 11) text: For those of you who have never been through this before, this is what the beginning of a fire sale looks like. I don't have to tell any of you that the first hour and a half is going to be very important. I want you to hit every bite you can find. Dealers, clients, brokers, and your mother if she's buying...and obviously no swaps, its outgoing only today. This is obviously not the way any of us would like for this to be going down, but the ground is shifting below our feet, and there appears to be no other way out. SAM looks around the room again, person by person and see that they indeed know what needs to be done. SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
69) 1) text: Well done. SAM ROGERS
69) 3) text: I wanted to give you a heads up. They are going to start sending some people home out here. SAM ROGERS
69) 5) text: (He nods yes) Sorry. No loose ends. SAM ROGERS
71) 1) text: Sam, please sit. Congratulations are clearly in order. SAM ROGERS
71) 6) text: They just sit in silence for a long beat as TULD takes a more bites of his meal. TULD So what can I do for you? SAM ROGERS I want out. TULD I'm sorry? SAM ROGERS I'm done, I want out. TULD It's been a very difficult day, for everyone. SAM ROGERS I need you to release my options, that is if they're still worth anything after today, and I need the bonus. I'm out. TULD You'll get the bonus, the options, and keep your current base, but I need you to stay with me for another 24 months. O.K?
