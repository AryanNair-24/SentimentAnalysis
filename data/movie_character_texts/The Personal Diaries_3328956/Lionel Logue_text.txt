16) 60) dialog: A fortune. So, Bertie...when you talk to yourself, do you stammer?
16) 62) dialog: Thus proving your impediment isn’t a permanent part of you. What do you think was the cause? 23
16) 64) dialog: Bet you, Bertie, you can read flawlessly, right here, right now. Bertie snorts dismissively. LIONEL (CONT’D) And if I win, I get to ask questions.

16) 72) dialog: (nods ) I haven’t agreed to take you on. Logue has uncovered a piece of apparatus, a recording dev with earphones. He sets a blank disc onto the turntable a positions a microphone, then hands Bertie an open book. Bertie glares at it defiantly.
16) 74) dialog: Then you owe me a shilling for not trying. 24 Furious, Bertie opens the book and reads, stammers badly gets worse.
16) 76) dialog: I haven't finished yet. Lionel returns the book to Bertie and turns to some recor apparatus on a nearby table. LIONEL (CONT’D) I’m going to record your voice and then play it back to you on the same machine. This is brilliant. It’s the latest thing from America: a Silvertone. He hands Bertie a pair of heavily padded earphones. Berti doesn’t want to take them. LIONEL (CONT’D) There’s a bob in this, mate. You can go home rich! Bertie reluctantly puts them on. Logue turns a dial. LOUD MUSIC is heard. Bertie takes off the earphones. The music stops.
16) 78) dialog: I know.
16) 80) dialog: Surely a Prince’s brain knows what its mouth is doing?

17) 27) dialog: Didn’t think so.
17) 29) dialog: No, I showed you what you can do. (tries to get them to understand) What you’re asking will only deal with the surface of the problem.
17) 32) dialog: Lionel.
17) 34) dialog: Alright. You want mechanics? We need to relax your throat muscles and strengthen your tongue. By repeating tongue twisters for example. “I am a thistle-sifter. I have a sieve of sifted thistles and a sieve of unsifted thistles. Because I am a thistle sifter.”
17) 36) dialog: You have a flabby tummy, we must build up the strength in your diaphragm. Simple mechanics.
17) 38) dialog: And that’s about a shilling’s worth. 31
17) 40) dialog: Of course.
17) 43) dialog: I shall see you every day. On Bertie, reacting.
17) 45) dialog: Hum for as long as you like. Hmmmmmmmmmm. ~And when you're ready, “Mother”.
17) 47) dialog: Beaut.
17) 49) dialog: A simple outward breath. “FFFFF” Wait for the “aa”. “FFFFFather”. Just slide into it.

17) 60) dialog: Yes you can, come on, come on.
17) 63) dialog: Gently of course. Elizabeth sits gingerly on Bertie’s stomach, asking solicitously:
17) 65) dialog: Now exhale slowly...can you feel that resistance, Bertie? Down goes your Royal Highness...inhale slowly...and...up comes your Royal Highness. Exhale and down. Yes. Inhale and up. You get the idea.
17) 67) dialog: Do it at home. Doesn’t have to be you, of course, but I thought he’d prefer you to one of the staff. Lionel encourages Bertie to move as he reads a joke out. LIONEL (CONT’D) Move, rock back and forth on the balls of your feet, keep the movement continuous and flowing.
17) 70) dialog: (tapping him on the diaphragm) Let’s connect the toned diaphragm with your relaxed throat. Ma‘’am, would you be so kind as to be the timekeeper? 34 Lionel hands her a stop watch.
17) 72) dialog: Anyone who can vibrate loudly in full view of the world can learn to give a speech.
17) 74) dialog: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeceeecee.....
21) 18) dialog: What?
21) 20) dialog: (flattered) You sure? Allright put your thinking caps on.
21) 24) dialog: “Art thou afeard?”
21) 26) dialog: Oh! For heaven’s sake.. that was a lucky guess!
21) 28) dialog: “Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices, That, if then I had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again:” (to Valentine) Alright, clever clogs, what comes next?
21) 30) dialog: (overlapping) ..-when I waked, I cried to dream again.” It’s such a sad thought. A KNOCK at the door. Lionel is not expecting anyone. LIONEL (CONT’D) Next patient must be early. You better go lads, I’m sorry. (to the door) Won't be a moment, Clifford. 4l INT. WAITING ROOM TO LOGUE’S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS The door opens. Bertie is on the other side.

21) 52) dialog: Yes songs. 43
21) 54) dialog: I love that song.

21) 60) dialog: You can with me.
21) 62) dialog: I take that as a compliment.
21) 64) dialog: Try “Camptown Races” then. (sings) “My brother D, he said to me, doo- dah doo-dah...” Continuous sound will give you flow. Does it feel strange, now that David’s on the throne?
21) 66) dialog: But unless he produces an heir, you’re next in line. And your daughter, Elizabeth, would then succeed you.
21) 68) dialog: “Lionel, Lionel." You didn’t stammer.
21) 70) dialog: Well, as a little reward, you get to put some glue on these struts.

22) 1) dialog: (whispers a running commentary to the boys) That’s the Prince of Wales. He’s now King because he’s the oldest. Lionel spots... Bertie, in the procession passing by. Lionel stares at him. Tries to make eye contact. In the m of this pomp and ceremony the immense potential importanc his client sinks in. Of course, Bertie doesn’t see him. LIONEL (CONT’D) Quite an irony...all this.
22) 3) dialog: His children weren’t too fond of him.
22) 5) dialog: Heard it...at work. Lionel points, to distract.
22) 6) dialog: Think the German will make it? 48 Return to archive footage, a contorted limping German is seen. The procession of dignitaries continues.

29) 20) dialog: I’m not a geisha girl.
29) 22) dialog: What is it about David that stops you speaking?
29) 24) dialog: Vulgar but fluent. You don’t stammer when you swear.
29) 26) dialog: Is that the best you can do?
29) 28) dialog: A public school prig can do better than that.
29) 30) dialog: See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue?
29) 32) dialog: Ah. Know the f-word?
29) 34) dialog: Bertie. Lionel gives him a look.

29) 52) dialog: Can’t they carry on privately?
29) 54) dialog: Where does that leave you?
29) 56) dialog: Has it come to that? But the way things are going, your place may be on the throne.
29) 58) dialog: If you had to you could outshine David... Lionel reaches out and gives Bertie a pat of comfort on t shoulder. Bertie pulls back in offended shock.

41) 12) dialog: Like your Dad used to do?
41) 14) dialog: Your father. He’s not here.
41) 16) dialog: Easy enough to give away. You don’t have to carry him around in your pocket. Or your brother. You don’t need to be afraid of things you were afraid of when you were five. A pause - LIONEL (CONT’D) You're very much your own man, Bertie. Your face is next, mate. There’s a noise outside the door.
41) 18) dialog: Myrtle! Lionel stands and pressed himself up against the wall.

47) 6) dialog: Bertie, I heard you at Wembley, I was there. I heard you. My son Laurie said “Do you think you could help that poor man?” I replied “If I had the chance”.
47) 8) dialog: It’s true, I’m not a doctor, and yes I acted a bit, recited in pubs and taught elocution in schools. When the Great War came, our boys were pouring back from the front, shell-shocked and unable to speak and somebody said, “Lionel, you’re very good at all this speech stuff. Do you think you could possibly help these poor buggers”. I did muscle therapy, exercise, relaxation, but I knew I had to go deeper. Those poor young blokes had cried out in fear, and no-one was listening to them. My job was to give them faith in their voice and let them know that a friend was listening. That must ring a few bells with you, Bertie.
47) 10) dialog: Make inquiries. It’s all true.
47) 12) dialog: But lots of success! I can’t show you a certificate - there was no training then. All I know I know by experience, and that war was some experience. May plaque says, ‘L. Logue, Speech Defects’. No Dr., no letters after my name. (with mock seriousness) Lock me in the Tower.

47) 28) dialog: Heard as what?!
47) 30) dialog: (quietly) Yes you do. You have such perseverance, Bertie, you’re the bravest man I know. And you’1l make a bloody good king. Bertie stares at him. A familiar voice is heard from the shadows.
47) 40) dialog: Thank you Bertie. Shall we rehearse? Bertie sits in the ceremonial chair once more. LIONEL (CONT’D) As soon as you and Elizabeth enter the West door, you’ll be greeted with the hymn “I Was Glad When They Said Unto Me.” You won’t actually be that glad, because they sing it for a great long time. Then your friend the Archbishop will ponce up and say, “Sir, is Your Majesty willing to take The Oath?” You say..
47) 42) dialog: Course you are! I’1l see what it sounds like from the cheap seats so even your old nanny can hear. “Will you govern your peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand according to their lands and customs?”
