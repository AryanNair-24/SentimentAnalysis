159) 2) dialog: The Large Man turns, whipping his headphones off, LOUDER around his neck. Dwight stands ready with a cautious hand
159) 4) dialog: Wow, bro- you look square.
159) 6) dialog: No shit, man- just peaced-the-fuck- out... He pulls out cigarettes, Dwight declines and Ben lights u
159) 7) dialog: ...Same year El Duce got hit by a train. (slaps his truck) Yo, I put the first two hundred miles on this thing stapling up your ‘missing’ posters.
159) 9) dialog: Your sister, man. She was hell bent. Then I think a bunch of your parking tickets came in the mail- she called it all off... 57. Dwight nods, thrown off. They listen to HEADPHONE CRACKLE
159) 10) dialog: I took off too! (lifting shirt, showing a ‘U.S.M.C.’ tattoo) Joined up soon as I graduated. Nev- Ben cuts himself off, cocking his head.
159) 11) dialog: Was...that you? (pointing back) By the dumpster?
159) 13) dialog: Yeah... So should we get beers?
159) 15) dialog: Sure. What do you need?
159) 17) dialog: Whoa.
159) 19) dialog: (taking a drag) Shit, man- you can pretty much buy one anywhere.
159) 21) dialog: Hold on. Are you a junkie, dude?
159) 23) dialog: (realizing) Oh, wait. Shit. It’s about that time... Ben gives a subtle nod, takes another drag.
159) 24) dialog: Yeah. Hop in brother. Ben heads to his truck.
159) 26) dialog: You gassed up? I’m in the boonies.
160) 0) text: The Bonneville’s headlights project onto kicked-up dust f Ben’s truck. The tree-lined road vanishes into pitch blac EXT. BEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT 176 The two vehicles pull past a shotgun shack up to a single story prefab house. Dwight parks twenty feet short. INT. BEDROOM - BEN’S HOUSE - PRE-DAWN 177 HALLWAY LIGHTS CLICK ON. Ben leads Dwight into the sparse earthy room, neatly kept if a bit dank.
160) 1) dialog: Hey- I got something..
160) 3) dialog: You remember when James Henry’s brother had the stripper at his party? At his shop? 59.
160) 5) dialog: I got a Polaroid of me and you with the stripper. It’s hilarious- we’re both terrified.
160) 8) dialog: Very little. Ben pulls a MAGNETIC BOX from behind a locker, shaking ou KEYS and turning them in the locks.
160) 9) dialog: More into target shooting. What do you need it for?
160) 11) dialog: Oh- no, man. The less I know, the better. What do you need out of the gun. At range? Close quarters? Dwight stands at a loss as Ben swings open the doors.
160) 12) dialog: Close up or far away?
160) 14) dialog: Roger that. See what I’ve got... (running his hand along the racks) An Enfield mark three, Circuit Judge, a Mosin... He pulls out a vintage BOLT-ACTION RIFLE, feeling the wei 60.
160) 15) dialog: ..-which is my current favorite. Bolt action, heavy, and the surplus ammo is cheap. He sets it on the bed and wipes his nose.
160) 16) dialog: The AK, Mossberg- might be a bit much. What do you weigh?
160) 18) dialog: ...the Sterling might jam up on you. Ben pulls out a VINTAGE SUB MACHINE GUN.
160) 19) dialog: It’ll clear a room, though. Ah. He replaces the sub machine gun, removing a bulky automat pistol from the cabinet.
160) 20) dialog: I picked this up this year. Steyr nineteen-twelve. Shoots it’s own nine mil cartridge, great shape- but you gotta load it slide-back with a stripper clip.
160) 22) dialog: The World War I and II models are bring-backs- no papers, no import marks. But you don’t want a bolt- action... Dwight stews in ignorance. Ben reads it, selecting a MINI RIFLE.
160) 23) dialog: Here. The Mini Fourteen. Gunshow- no papers. It’s a carbine- that just means it’s short. Semi-auto- it fires every time you pull the trigger- twenty rounds. Very reliable. Plus, I got ammo here. 61. Ben expertly loads a clip and assumes a firing position, trigger finger extended against the guard.
160) 24) dialog: Recognize it? Dwight shakes ‘no’.
160) 25) dialog: It’s the A-Team gun. From the show. Their’s were stainless... Ben presents the rifle. Dwight grabs it, but Ben holds fi
160) 26) dialog: (nodding) What’s up with that? Dwight follows Ben’s gaze to a BLOOD STAIN on his SHIRT A PANTS.
160) 28) dialog: Not so well, huh. Ben lets go of the rifle. Dwight feels the weight.
160) 29) dialog: So then, you’re already in this?
160) 31) dialog: Because I was just blowing smoke up your ass, bro. Preparing a speech in my head to stop you from whatever crazy shit you’re about to do.
160) 33) dialog: Thought about calling the cops.
160) 35) dialog: I do, bro. But I can’t send you off like this. I could teach you. CQB, man! Surprise, speed, violence of action...
160) 37) dialog: I’ve got sixteen acres. Follow the road we came in on ‘till it ends- you'll see the targets.
160) 39) dialog: You right handed? Dwight nods ‘yes’.
160) 40) dialog: Real quick. Keep the safety off. Wherever your eyes look, the gun follows. And keep your distance- or it can get sloppy.
160) 42) dialog: (shutting the lockers) Two on purpose.
162) 77) dialog: (echoing across the field)
162) 80) dialog: SORRY. COULDN'T SHOOT ‘TILL HE
162) 84) dialog: That’s what bullets do. Dwight watches in awe as Ben scoops the Mini-14 from the ground, pops the clip and safeties it beside the Mosin.
162) 85) dialog: Jesus man, I am not impressed. Told you to keep your distance- you missed from two yards? Ben grabs Teddy’s corpse under the armpits, waits for Dwi
162) 86) dialog: Let’s go man. I’d like him off my property. C’mon. 71. Dwight dusts off and grabs the corpse by the ankles. They lift and carry.
162) 87) dialog: This Wade Cleland?
162) 89) dialog: (noticing the blood) Wipe your face off. He’s probably got hepatitis. They drop the body in the open trunk.
162) 90) dialog: (re: Teddy’s cell phone) Pick that up, throw it in here. Dwight does as he’s told.
162) 91) dialog: Don’t forget to wipe it down before you get rid of it. You got the keys? Dwight checks his pockets and nods ‘yes’.
162) 92) dialog: Show ‘em to me. Dwight presents the keys. Ben shuts the trunk firmly.
162) 94) dialog: Coyotes will get that. (second look) Long as there’s no teeth...
162) 96) dialog: Yeah, well. I’m switching you to buckshot. 181 182 72. EXT. SECLUDED AREA - BEN’S PROPERTY - LATER 181 A CRUDE STACK OF JUGS AND CRATES BLOWS APART. Dwight FIRES a CIRCUIT JUDGE REVOLVING RIFLE. He lowers the barrel, pops the cylinder and tosses the sp shells, looking to Ben.
162) 97) dialog: It’s doesn’t have the stopping power of a twelve gauge- but you seem comfortable with it. Dwight nods, drifting. Ben swaps guns as Dwight TUNES OUT.
162) 98) dialog: Shoots slugs too- but you wouldn’t hit anything. Only five shots though, so the Steyr is your secondary- backup. Another eight rounds, and stopping power- Ben steps to Dwight until his wandering eyes make contact
162) 99) dialog: This is personal, I know. But that’s how you’ll fail. No talking. No speeches. If you point the gun, you shoot the gun. Dwight nods. EXT. DRIVEWAY - BEN’S HOUSE - DAY 182 Dwight and Ben load the guns and a pack in the Bonneville
162) 100) dialog: This should do you.
162) 102) dialog: Well, once you're back to the main road- closest one’s about 20 miles. But that’s east. I assume you’re heading west. It’s just a gas station, though- watcha need? 183 184 73.
162) 104) dialog: Yeah, man. Dwight watches Ben double time it to the house. INT. KITCHEN - BEN’S HOUSE - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 183 Ben piles SNACKS from cabinets into a SHOPPING BAG. From pantry he pulls packets of VACUUM SEALED FOOD. EXT. BEN’S HOUSE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 184 Dwight shuts the Bonneville’s door and turns to Ben, approaching with the grocery bag.
162) 105) dialog: Threw a few MREs in there. Dwight accepts the bag and hands Ben the OLD YEARBOOK.
162) 106) dialog: (flipping through) Nice! I lost mine, or shot it up...
162) 108) dialog: (closing yearbook) It’s come and gone. Plus, I’m glad you did. You'd be dead otherwise.
162) 110) dialog: If it were my family, I might do the same. I don’t know. But I’m not helping ‘cus this is right. This is ugly, man. The two stand in silence, acknowledging the weight. 185 186 187 74.
162) 113) dialog: Yeah?
162) 115) dialog: Okay.
163) 6) dialog: Ha.
