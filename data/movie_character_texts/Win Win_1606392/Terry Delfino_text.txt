18) 3) dialog: How's the team doing?
18) 7) dialog: What the hell happened? We used to be good.
18) 13) dialog: Can we walk for a bit?
18) 18) dialog: That sucked. You're running good, buddy. Kicking my ass.
18) 23) dialog: You gotta be kidding me.
18) 27) dialog: Lori's texting me at seven in the morning to ask me if I want an antique sewing table that we bought together.
18) 31) dialog: No. I want my fucking house back!
18) 35) dialog: You mean my contractor? The guy I hired? Yeah, she is. I can just picture that little scumbag walking around my house wearing his tool belt. Here.
18) 38) dialog: Take a picture for me.
18) 43) dialog: Take it! Jesus, Ter!
18) 45) dialog: Hurry! It's cold.
18) 50) dialog: Too late. I hate her.
18) 55) dialog: Nah. Finley called me. He's starting up a new fund out here in May so I'm gonna wait for that.
18) 59) dialog: Yeah. He's an animal. He prints money. Come on, let's finish strong.
18) 64) dialog: What?
18) 69) dialog: You alright?
18) 77) dialog: Holy fuck! Mike? Hang on pal.
18) 80) dialog: Fuck! Fuck!
18) 83) dialog: You gotta be kidding me. Shit.
18) 86) dialog: Is it your heart, buddy? Are you having a heart attack?
18) 90) dialog: That could be a heart attack, Mike. You should lie down.
18) 93) dialog: Get off me! Just lie down.
18) 97) dialog: Who cares? You might be dying. Are you cold? Do you feel cold?
18) 101) dialog: Look into my eyes, Mike. Look into my eyes.
19) 3) dialog: OK dude, how long has that been happening?
19) 7) dialog: Seriously? Did he prescribe anything for you?
19) 11) dialog: Jesus. That scared the shit out of me. What are you so stressed about, Mike?
19) 16) dialog: Is it that bad?
19) 20) dialog: Really? Holy shit, Mike! What're you gonna do?
19) 26) dialog: Have you told Jackie?
19) 30) dialog: Good call. So we just need a new strategy, that's all. What about that Judge that's always throwing work your way? Can't she help you out?
19) 34) dialog: Is there anything else you can do for money?
19) 39) dialog: Yeah. But that's why he makes it.
49) 5) dialog: Have you talked to his mother?
49) 10) dialog: Mother fucker. He's wearing his tool belt.
49) 14) dialog: No. Sorry dude, I was distracted.
49) 19) dialog: It's my fucking house and no. I'm just driving. Where's the kid now?
50) 11) dialog: It means you shouldn't be taking care of another kid. Especially a convict.
56) 9) dialog: Holy shit!
56) 14) dialog: Holy shit! He was thirty-five and one as a freshman!
56) 19) dialog: This kid had seventeen pins. He's a killer.
56) 23) dialog: Why?
56) 29) dialog: What're you talking about? You do. You have him. You can take this kid to the states, Mike.
56) 33) dialog: So what? Enroll him!
56) 37) dialog: So he's gotta do something, right? Let him wrestle. Look at this way, you're helping out the old man and this kid's a little bonus for doing the right thing.
56) 41) dialog: No. Shit, everyone gets paid, but think about it, Mike. What are the chances that this kid ends up on your door step and he can wrestle like that? It's a sign, pal.
56) 44) dialog: Check this out. There's a video link of him wrestling in some tournament.
56) 47) dialog: Look at that kid.
61) 3) dialog: What's up Fella's? Hitting the showers, huh?
62) 3) dialog: Oh yeah!
62) 9) dialog: What's up? Hey Vig.
62) 15) dialog: What do you think? I have to see this kid.
62) 19) dialog: Great. So what's next?
62) 24) dialog: Where ever the hell he wants, right?
62) 37) dialog: Hey man! Nice to meet you! Really nice to meet you. Welcome.
62) 57) dialog: Excellent. Done.
63) 12) dialog: I'll do it.
63) 15) dialog: You don't mind, do you?
63) 25) dialog: Wow!
64) 3) dialog: I don't know why we didn't quit. Just the smell of that room brought back the memories. I hated it, it was like a form of self-abuse.
64) 7) dialog: Mike was average. I sucked. Sorry Abby.
64) 16) dialog: We both should have quit. Then we could have joined the ski club and gotten busy with Allison Shepard on the overnights.
64) 26) dialog: Sorry Abby. Getting busy is bad.
65) 7) dialog: Yeah, you're right. The kid has man strength, dude.
65) 12) dialog: Yeah. You know. Not kid strength. Man strength.
65) 16) dialog: What the hell are you doing anyway?
65) 20) dialog: Just call your IT guy?
65) 24) dialog: OK. I'm just gonna say what's on my mind. I want to be an assistant coach too.
65) 30) dialog: Yeah. Why not? I'm value added. Especially compared to Vig.
65) 34) dialog: Well first of all I'm fun. No denying that. And secondly, unlike Vig, I actually used to wrestle.
65) 38) dialog: That doesn't matter, your team sucks. Plus I even look more like a coach then Vig.
65) 42) dialog: Look, Mike, I'm serious here. I need some distraction in my life right now. All I do is sit in my condo and think about Lori and that guy having sex in the jacuzzi I paid for. It's fucking unhealthy. I've been really kind of going crazy. Really.
65) 47) dialog: My brother! I will not let you down. To the team.
65) 50) dialog: Hey, what should I wear to practice?
65) 56) dialog: Really?
65) 60) dialog: Good one, Coach! See, it's already fun.
70) 5) dialog: This kid is just fricking cool.
71) 5) dialog: This song sucks.
71) 9) dialog: Hey Vig, which kid is yours anyway?
71) 13) dialog: Really? You're son quit?
71) 17) dialog: Harsh. So why you still doing it?
71) 26) dialog: Sorry buddy. I got to be near, Mike. It's good luck.
72) 24) dialog: Come on, Kyle. Take this punk out.
72) 30) dialog: Sorry. I'm just excited. You know me.
72) 33) dialog: What's he doing?
72) 51) dialog: Good. That's good, right?
72) 57) dialog: 
80) 29) dialog: Did they really pin all of you?
89) 7) dialog: Why does he puke? He's a heavyweight. He doesn't have to lose weight.
89) 11) dialog: Sweet Lord. This is a team for the ages.
89) 35) dialog: Have you ever wrestled in a match before Stemler?
90) 17) dialog: We're dead.
91) 10) dialog: That's a huge fucking "if".
91) 17) dialog: Sorry, Stemler. You're a champ.
91) 57) dialog: I can't watch.
91) 66) dialog: What?
91) 72) dialog: What the hell does that mean?
91) 76) dialog: Seriously?
93) 7) dialog: District champ, baby.
97) 3) dialog: Yeah. We're playing Wii Golf. I'm destroying him. Dude, this kid really hates his mother.
102) 5) dialog: Just take her to court, you'll kill her.
102) 9) dialog: Why not? She's a freaking mess. You're a pillar of the community, Mike.
102) 13) dialog: So maybe you'll get a different judge.
102) 17) dialog: Then dump it. Give her Poplar. It sucks but you've got your practice to worry about, right?
102) 21) dialog: Incoming, dude.
102) 43) dialog: Wow. What's your play?
102) 47) dialog: She's looking for a payout, dude. Just buy her stake and give her an exit.
102) 51) dialog: Just give her some of Leo's money and send her home. He's not gonna miss it. He's in happy land.
102) 60) dialog: What's your play?
102) 65) dialog: Really? You want me to slap your face? Get you psyched up for the call?
106) 3) dialog: Brass balls, buddy. Brass balls.
106) 7) dialog: That's good.
106) 11) dialog: It totally worked. They opened their kimono and you made them eat the trade.
106) 17) dialog: Really?
107) 9) dialog: Yeah, he is.
108) 5) dialog: Definitely. And wait till we get to the states! Atlantic City here we come, baby.
112) 3) dialog: We were right there, Mike. Right fucking there. And now we have nothing. Nothing!
112) 8) dialog: No.
112) 19) dialog: I'll track him down.
112) 23) dialog: 
115) 9) dialog: Calm down?! We are gonna sue you guys, silly. He's a laywer!
115) 15) dialog: Hey folks, listen up! Watch out for each other.
116) 3) dialog: There's a light on.
116) 21) dialog: What's he watching?
116) 33) dialog: This is freaking spooky.
116) 36) dialog: Should we break in?
116) 54) dialog: OK. That is very creepy.
117) 29) dialog: OK. That's super spooky. Just saying.
119) 18) dialog: Oh shit.
119) 25) dialog: Kyle wait... Watch the head fake!
119) 29) dialog: Kyle, stop for a minute. Keep your hands out, Mike. Hands out.
119) 33) dialog: I'm just trying to help.
119) 37) dialog: Ow! Oh shit.
119) 46) dialog: Sit out Mike! Sit out!
119) 56) dialog: I'm the ref. I'm just the ref!
125) 3) dialog: Hi guys.
125) 7) dialog: Dude, I'm your assistant coach. And just notice who isn't here.
125) 10) dialog: Stephen Vigman.
130) 3) dialog: Can I get a banana daiquiri, please?
130) 11) dialog: Nah. I'm good. But keep these coming.
130) 14) dialog: So how you doing, pal?
