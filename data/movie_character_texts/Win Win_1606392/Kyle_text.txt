33) 5) dialog: No. Ohio.
33) 10) dialog: It's just my mother and me. She's back in Columbus. She couldn't come.
33) 14) dialog: Bus.
33) 18) dialog: Yeah.
34) 11) dialog: Hi.
35) 7) dialog: Yeah, you do. We just never met.
35) 16) dialog: 
35) 22) dialog: Yeah.
37) 5) dialog: OK. He fell asleep watching TV. So he lives there now?
37) 9) dialog: Are you a friend of his or something?
37) 13) dialog: What's that mean?
37) 17) dialog: That's cool.
38) 5) dialog: Yeah.
38) 9) dialog: Yeah. I told her I was coming home.
38) 13) dialog: No.
38) 17) dialog: Yeah. If I want to smoke should I go outside?
38) 21) dialog: I know. But if I do.
38) 26) dialog: OK. Good night, Jackie.
40) 13) dialog: OK. Bye Leo.
40) 17) dialog: No. I'm going home.
40) 24) dialog: I won't.
41) 6) dialog: I have money.
41) 10) dialog: I have enough money. But thanks.
41) 15) dialog: Yeah. You too, Mike.
43) 5) dialog: I decided not to go home.
43) 9) dialog: You mind if I have a quick smoke?
44) 7) dialog: Not really.
45) 15) dialog: I can't live there anymore.
45) 19) dialog: No. She's not even there. She's in a clinic or hospital or whatever. I'm living with Craig.
45) 25) dialog: Her boyfriend, I guess, but he's an asshole.
45) 29) dialog: My mom? She doesn't care about me.
45) 34) dialog: She could've called, right?
50) 42) dialog: Can I go visit Leo?
50) 47) dialog: Yeah. Just down the street.
50) 51) dialog: 
52) 24) dialog: Now?
52) 28) dialog: Yeah, maybe.
52) 36) dialog: Hey Mike, you think I could practice with you guys tomorrow?
52) 40) dialog: You were right, they deserved it.
53) 3) dialog: I don't have wrestling shoes.
53) 7) dialog: Yeah.
54) 5) dialog: Yeah.
54) 9) dialog: A couple years ago.
54) 13) dialog: Just felt like it.
54) 19) dialog: I'm pretty good.
57) 5) dialog: I have money.
62) 31) dialog: 
62) 39) dialog: Thanks.
62) 46) dialog: Good.
62) 50) dialog: 
62) 55) dialog: One-nineteen.
62) 59) dialog: Is anyone there now?
62) 63) dialog: Don't you think we should wrestle off?
63) 28) dialog: Good match.
64) 5) dialog: Were you guys that bad?
65) 3) dialog: Hey, how do you think we'd do against Kyle? Now?
66) 8) dialog: You answered it?
66) 12) dialog: What'd she say?
66) 16) dialog: No. Can you not answer my phone anymore?
66) 25) dialog: I quit now that I'm wrestling
68) 5) dialog: Yeah. I went for a run.
68) 9) dialog: In season, yeah. I like to get my run in early and then drill some moves for an hour before school.
68) 13) dialog: Yeah...so I'm gonna do it. See you.
72) 6) dialog: Yeah.
72) 11) dialog: Can you give me a slap?
72) 15) dialog: Give me a slap. Across the face. Like your waking me up.
72) 20) dialog: Can you do it harder?
72) 43) dialog: 
72) 65) dialog: Yeah, pretty good.
73) 5) dialog: Can I go with you?
74) 5) dialog: It's for Leo.
74) 10) dialog: He's doing OK. He can say some pretty funny things. Yesterday he told me I was fired.
74) 14) dialog: I don't know. He just fired me.
74) 18) dialog: Yeah. He's a pretty funny dude.
74) 22) dialog: A little but I already did it.
74) 28) dialog: Yeah but just to wrestle. My old coach thought I could get a scholarship.
74) 38) dialog: Yeah.
75) 8) dialog: It's kind of my own thing.
75) 14) dialog: Well, it's not a move or anything, I just tell myself that the guy on top is going to take my head and shove it under water and kill me. And if I don't want to die on the bottom, I just gotta do what ever the fuck it takes to get out.
76) 5) dialog: No.
76) 9) dialog: Yeah. But I never believe her anyway.
76) 13) dialog: But this place is pretty nice.
76) 19) dialog: You want to take a walk outside, Leo?
76) 23) dialog: Your park, huh?
77) 5) dialog: Yeah. It's in my bag.
77) 8) dialog: Hey, Mike, can I ask you something?
77) 12) dialog: Leo told me that some Judge made him move into that place. Is that true or is he just making that up?
77) 17) dialog: Why?
77) 24) dialog: But he wants to live at home.
80) 5) dialog: No.
80) 9) dialog: You're not wrestling.
80) 13) dialog: You ever think about wrestling in a match?
80) 19) dialog: Thanks for letting me know.
81) 5) dialog: Yeah, I heard.
81) 25) dialog: He know's who I am now.
82) 3) dialog: Hi, can I watch TV in here?
82) 14) dialog: That's cool.
82) 18) dialog: Not really.
82) 25) dialog: What's it say?
82) 29) dialog: No I do not.
82) 33) dialog: Yeah. Me too.
82) 39) dialog: Can I tell you something?
82) 43) dialog: I didn't quit my old team. I got thrown off.
82) 47) dialog: I stole a car.
82) 51) dialog: Yeah. That was part of the problem.
82) 55) dialog: A teacher's.
82) 59) dialog: It was really stupid.
82) 63) dialog: Yeah. Everything just got messed up after that.
82) 69) dialog: I guess.
82) 73) dialog: Mike?
89) 16) dialog: Stemler wants to wrestle today.
89) 22) dialog: Right.
89) 28) dialog: He could wrestle 119. I could bump up and get a pin at 125 and Jimmy goes 130. Then we're only giving up one weight class and we got a shot.
89) 39) dialog: You're just waiting for the green light, right?
91) 46) dialog: Hey, Stemler. Come here.
91) 51) dialog: If he's Darth Vader then you're the Secret Apprentice. You got this.
92) 5) dialog: Cool. It was good coaching with Stemler.
92) 12) dialog: I don't know. I guess it just feels like I'm in control. Of everything. You know what I mean?
92) 16) dialog: It is.
94) 3) dialog: Hey, Leo. Guess who won the Districts?
94) 9) dialog: Me. And Mike said he got a call from a college scout about me.
94) 16) dialog: What are you doing here?
99) 3) dialog: So when wrestling's over I have to go?
99) 10) dialog: Where?
99) 17) dialog: I'll go see her at Leo's before practice. But I want to go alone.
99) 22) dialog: Don't worry, Mike. I'll go.
102) 28) dialog: Do you know she wants to take Leo back to Ohio?
102) 32) dialog: You're not gonna let her do that are you?
102) 36) dialog: What's complicated about it? She doesn't give a shit about Leo. They hate each other. You can't let her take him.
102) 40) dialog: Fine but I told her I'm staying with you guys until we leave.
110) 8) dialog: I'm sorry.
110) 13) dialog: I don't want to go with her. I don't.
113) 9) dialog: No. What do you want?
113) 14) dialog: Is that why you called me. Just to tell me that?
113) 18) dialog: Then leave him here. Where he is.
113) 22) dialog: What do you mean?
113) 29) dialog: What is it?
113) 34) dialog: This isn't real. The Judge told Leo he had to live there.
113) 44) dialog: Why?
113) 49) dialog: Why does he belong with us?
113) 57) dialog: Shut up! Shut up!
113) 60) dialog: Listen to me! I don't care about this. It's all bullshit. Leave Leo alone. He belongs here. Do you hear me? Do you?
117) 18) dialog: Yeah.
117) 26) dialog: You don't have to worry about us.
118) 5) dialog: 
118) 10) dialog: No.
118) 14) dialog: This is where he belongs.
118) 20) dialog: Yeah. We did! Listen to this.
118) 25) dialog: 
118) 31) dialog: It's from the court.
118) 35) dialog: From my mother.
118) 41) dialog: You're just like her.
119) 8) dialog: Leave me alone!
119) 15) dialog: Don't touch me!
119) 23) dialog: Explain what? How you lied to me? How you lied to Leo?
120) 3) dialog: Hello. Hello. Mom?
120) 8) dialog: No.
120) 14) dialog: No. We got in a fight because he's an asshole.
120) 18) dialog: Yeah, really, Stem.
123) 5) dialog: The window.
123) 9) dialog: No. I'm leaving. I just came to get my shit.
123) 14) dialog: I know, Mike, you're sorry. Everyone's always sorry.
123) 18) dialog: It's too late. You'll lose. My mother's gonna take him.
123) 24) dialog: So what?! You want me to forgive you now? Is that it, Mike?!
123) 29) dialog: This is bullshit!
123) 34) dialog: I want to be alone.
123) 38) dialog: (Without looking at them)
127) 18) dialog: What's up, coach? Hi.
127) 22) dialog:
