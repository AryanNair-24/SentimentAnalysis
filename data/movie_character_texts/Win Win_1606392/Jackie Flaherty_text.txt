2) 9) dialog: He's running.
4) 3) dialog: Shit.
4) 6) dialog: How was the run?
4) 9) dialog: Good. It was good. Abby, finish your cereal.
4) 11) dialog: 
4) 17) dialog: You do too, so stop drawing and eat.
4) 21) dialog: They're all the same.
4) 28) dialog: Maybe you should show the team.
4) 35) dialog: Honey, you can't use that word. It's a bad word.
4) 38) dialog: What? Don't look at me.
4) 46) dialog: Hey. You OK?
4) 50) dialog: You sure?
4) 54) dialog: Just checking.
4) 61) dialog: Just a minute.
5) 3) dialog: Mike?
5) 6) dialog: Did you call Fenn about the tree?
5) 10) dialog: Please do. I don't want it coming down on the house.
5) 15) dialog: Mike?
5) 19) dialog: I love you.
30) 5) dialog: Let's go, Mr. Mayor. It's cold and I need to pick up some bagels for your mom's.
30) 9) dialog: Where?
30) 13) dialog: Why?
30) 17) dialog: No, I mean why are you doing it?
30) 22) dialog: What? Since when?
30) 27) dialog: That's a big deal, Mike. Were you even gonna tell me?
30) 28) dialog: It's not a big deal. And yes, It is too. I was gonna tell you.
30) 30) dialog: You don't have time to be taking care of some old man.
30) 36) dialog: And who pays for that?
30) 40) dialog: I don't get it. You've never done it before.
30) 44) dialog: So why are you doing it now?
30) 48) dialog: Well, it sounds like a big deal. And you should have told me.
30) 52) dialog: Ask your daddy, sweetie. Maybe he'll tell you.
31) 3) dialog: Is that his house?
31) 9) dialog: (Re: the Young Man) Who's that?
33) 3) dialog: So do you live around here, Kyle?
33) 8) dialog: Ohio? And where are your parents?
33) 12) dialog: So how did you get here?
33) 16) dialog: Really? All by yourself?
33) 20) dialog: Wow.
36) 5) dialog: No. Not yet. Oh and he was smoking too. He's sixteen!
36) 9) dialog: I know.
36) 17) dialog: Thank you, Gina. I agree. He somehow forgot to tell me about it.
36) 21) dialog: Not until I asked.
36) 33) dialog: It is crazy. It's crazy.
38) 3) dialog: Everything alright?
38) 7) dialog: Did you reach your mom?
38) 11) dialog: Did she want to talk to me or anything?
38) 15) dialog: Well, I'm sorry you can't stay longer but maybe you can come back with your mom and visit again.
38) 19) dialog: You shouldn't be smoking.
38) 24) dialog: Yeah. You should go outside.
38) 28) dialog: Good night, Kyle.
39) 5) dialog: We have kids, Mike. I'm not taking any chances with Eminem down there.
42) 11) dialog: What?
42) 15) dialog: What? Why?
42) 20) dialog: What?
45) 3) dialog: Kyle?
45) 6) dialog: We can't help you if you don't tell us what's going on. Is there a reason you don't want to go home?
45) 9) dialog: What happened to your eye, Kyle?
45) 12) dialog: Kyle. You can trust us.
45) 17) dialog: With your Mom? Did she do that to your eye?
45) 21) dialog: Who's Craig?
45) 27) dialog: Does she even know you're here?
45) 31) dialog: How do you know? She's probably worried sick and just doesn't know how to reach you.
47) 8) dialog: No. But I'm not sending him back until I talk to his mother. She better freaking call me back.
47) 15) dialog: I don't care. I'm not sending him back there, Mike. I can't. And for the record, I'm not very happy about it either!
47) 19) dialog: Yes, we do, Mike! We do. It makes me so angry and so damn sad to see that poor kid in that kind of situation. He's just a kid.
47) 24) dialog: I just want to go to Ohio and...beat the crap out of his mom.
47) 28) dialog: I do. I want to beat the crap out of her and her stupid boyfriend.
47) 33) dialog: I'm serious.
47) 37) dialog: Well it feels like it. I'm leaving her another message.
47) 42) dialog: Yes. Now. Shush!
52) 3) dialog: Here, have some more corn.
52) 6) dialog: I'll get you some more milk too.
52) 9) dialog: Did you call Fenn about the tree, Mike?
52) 15) dialog: Mike. Don't start. You two are not cutting down that tree. Just call Fenn.
52) 18) dialog: I'm going to give her some Tylenol.
57) 3) dialog: Here's five dollars for lunch. I have no idea what it costs but let me know when you find out.
57) 7) dialog: Good for you. Save it. Now take this, it's too early to argue.
57) 12) dialog: Bye Jackie.
57) 15) dialog: Hey, you sure we should do this?
57) 19) dialog: OK. Go.
64) 14) dialog: No, I'll take him.
64) 20) dialog: Hey! Yo! Terry!
64) 24) dialog: Your Uncle Terry is just silly.
66) 3) dialog: Hello? Hello, this Jackie Flaherty. Kyle is staying with us. Hello? (She closes the phone) I'm gonna kill that lady.
66) 6) dialog: Oh. Hi. I heard your phone ringing and...
66) 10) dialog: Yeah, well, I saw it was your Mom and we've been waiting to hear from her.
66) 14) dialog: She didn't say anything. She hung up. Have you talked to her?
66) 18) dialog: Yeah. OK. I can do that. I'm sorry.
66) 23) dialog: Oh. Here's a bucket. You shouldn't be smoking but if you do could you put the cigarettes in here.
66) 27) dialog: Oh. Good. OK.
67) 3) dialog: Is that Abby?
69) 5) dialog: What's he doing?
69) 9) dialog: Is he gonna do it every morning?
69) 14) dialog: I hate you.
73) 3) dialog: I'm going to the market. I'll be back in a bit.
73) 7) dialog: Uh...yeah OK.
74) 3) dialog: Coco Puffs. Is that your brand?
74) 7) dialog: Nice. Drop it in, it's on me. Go ahead.
74) 12) dialog: Fired? For what?
74) 16) dialog: I think I have to meet this Leo.
74) 20) dialog: You have any home work?
74) 24) dialog: Impressive. You ever think about going to college?
74) 30) dialog: Yeah, I hear you're pretty good. So why'd you quit?
74) 33) dialog: You don't have to tell me. It's alright.
74) 36) dialog: Do you like tacos?
74) 40) dialog: Me, too. I make a mean taco.
78) 3) dialog: What? She doesn't even know us!
78) 7) dialog: For how long?
78) 13) dialog: I can't believe this lady.
78) 18) dialog: In the basement with Abby.
78) 23) dialog: We let him stay. I don't know, do we even have a choice?
81) 18) dialog: I don't know, honey.
82) 7) dialog: Yeah but I want to show you something. Stella, who's that?
82) 12) dialog: She started saying it at the match today.
82) 16) dialog: OK. So I have to ask, those tatoo's must have hurt, right?
82) 20) dialog: Don't lie to me. Look.
82) 23) dialog: I got it on Spring Break. Hurt like hell.
82) 27) dialog: JBJ. Jon Bon Jovi. I'm a fan. You got a problem with that?
82) 31) dialog: That was fun today. You're good. I'm glad you started wrestling again.
82) 37) dialog: No quitting this time, you got that?
82) 41) dialog: Of course.
82) 45) dialog: Why?
82) 49) dialog: What? You're don't even drive.
82) 53) dialog: Who's car did you steal?
82) 57) dialog: Oh my God.
82) 61) dialog: Yeah. It was stupid. You could have killed yourself.
82) 65) dialog: Yeah, well we all do stupid things. But the best part is that you got a another chance and now you're kicking butt.
82) 71) dialog: It's true. And you know who would agree with me?
82) 76) dialog: Nope. JBJ.
95) 5) dialog: He's upset. I don't blame him. It's weird that she just shows up like that. (Checking her watch) And of course she's late, the druggie.
95) 9) dialog: You're gonna talk to her, right?
95) 18) dialog: It's not my fault if I punch her.
95) 31) dialog: Hi, Cindy. Nice to meet you.
95) 35) dialog: Thanks. Abby, our six year old, is downstairs with Kyle.
95) 40) dialog: Do you want to sit down?
95) 46) dialog: Thank you very much.
95) 64) dialog: He's a really sweet kid. Our girls love him.
95) 72) dialog: Oh hey...these things happen, Cindy. And we've loved having him.
112) 11) dialog: Mike, your mom's here and dinner's almost ready. Have you seen Kyle?
112) 17) dialog: No.
112) 26) dialog: Yeah, right.
112) 29) dialog: You OK?
112) 32) dialog: What are we gonna do, Mike?
112) 36) dialog: And you don't think you'd beat her in court?
112) 40) dialog: Why? It's so obvious she's just wants him for the money.
112) 46) dialog: I do.
114) 6) dialog: Anything?
114) 10) dialog: This is crazy, where could he be?
114) 14) dialog: Well we should take a drive, your mom can stay with the kids.
115) 7) dialog: Mike! Calm down.
116) 5) dialog: It's got to be him. Do have the key?
116) 17) dialog: What's he doing?
116) 23) dialog: Who cares?
116) 40) dialog: Is he OK?
117) 16) dialog: Kyle? You took Leo?
117) 24) dialog: About both of you!
118) 12) dialog: Kyle, why did you do this? Please just tell us. Leo needs to be in a home.
118) 16) dialog: Kyle he needs to be at Oak Knoll.
118) 28) dialog: What is that?
118) 33) dialog: Where did you get this?
118) 38) dialog: Mike?
119) 29) dialog: Kyle, stop for a minute. Keep your hands out, Mike. Hands out.
119) 31) dialog: Terry, stop it!
119) 35) dialog: You're not helping.
119) 39) dialog: Mike, stop it!
119) 48) dialog: Shut up, Terry! Kyle, stop it!
119) 53) dialog: Would you stop coaching and break that up!
119) 59) dialog: Kyle! Stop! Please!
119) 62) dialog: Is that true, Mike?
119) 67) dialog: So why'd you move him if he wanted to stay here.
119) 71) dialog: Then you shouldn't have taken him.
119) 77) dialog: Why?!
119) 81) dialog: You moved an old man out of his house to make money? Have you lost your freaking mind?
119) 85) dialog: Really? Or you just didn't think you'd get caught?
119) 90) dialog: Home!
122) 5) dialog: Hi.
122) 9) dialog: No. He slept at Stemler's. How about you?
122) 14) dialog: So what are you going to do?
122) 18) dialog: You can't. You told the Judge you were keeping Leo at home.
122) 22) dialog: So then tell her you changed your mind. No one can question that.
122) 26) dialog: Why not?
122) 30) dialog: Well I'm glad your done lying now, just in time to lose your practice. That's how we survive, Mike. Your family. You ever think of that?
122) 37) dialog: Shit.
122) 42) dialog: I know.
123) 3) dialog: Hey Kyle. How'd you get down here?
123) 7) dialog: Are you hungry? I was gonna make some pancakes.
123) 44) dialog: Kyle, I just wanna say - we love you.
128) 10) dialog: I know, Shelly called. Oh, I dropped off the fan at Leo's today.
128) 17) dialog: Do you have time to eat.
128) 21) dialog: Make sure you do.
