94) 18) dialog: I came to get you, honey. And to see Grandpa. I missed you so much. Can I have a hug, baby?
94) 23) dialog: Oh, he's just had to go somewhere, Dad. Do you want some juice?
95) 25) dialog: Hi.
95) 29) dialog: Hi.
95) 33) dialog: She's very cute.
95) 37) dialog: Oh. OK.
95) 42) dialog: Thanks. This is a very nice house.
95) 53) dialog: No. No thanks. I'm fine.
95) 58) dialog: How's he doing?
95) 62) dialog: Really? That's good. He loves wrestling so much.
95) 66) dialog: That's nice.
95) 69) dialog: I am so sorry about this...it's just been such a difficult time...
95) 79) dialog: Hi Abby.
96) 5) dialog: That's okay. Thanks.
96) 9) dialog: That's great.
96) 16) dialog: I'd like to but don't think I can afford to stay in the hotel for that long. Do you think we could stay in my dad's house?
96) 21) dialog: Then, yeah, I could stay.
98) 11) dialog: Maybe I'll just go back to the hotel. It might just be too much for him tonight. I can see him tomorrow.
98) 15) dialog: Yeah. I think maybe that's better. I know how Kyle can be.
100) 35) dialog: I want to take care of him.
100) 41) dialog: That's where my support network is now. It's home.
100) 47) dialog: I already talked to him about it. He seem to like the idea.
100) 59) dialog: Kyle's still coming to see me today, right?
100) 65) dialog: Thanks Mike.
104) 14) dialog: 
104) 22) dialog: Who did he leave it too? Did he leave it to Kyle?!
104) 26) dialog: Then who? You?
104) 30) dialog: That scumbag! He never cared about anyone but himself and his fucking money. Did you know about this?
104) 34) dialog: Please what?
104) 40) dialog: What's to discuss? I'm not taking care of him if I'm not getting anything for it.
108) 11) dialog: Good luck, baby.
111) 5) dialog: I wanted to see my son wrestle.
111) 9) dialog: That's not my fault.
111) 13) dialog: I want my father.
111) 19) dialog: You have no idea what my father used to be like. No idea! He wasn't like he is now! He treated me like shit and he was all I had!
111) 23) dialog: I want that commission! That should be mine!
111) 27) dialog: Isn't that why you did it?
111) 32) dialog: What's that?
111) 36) dialog: I'm his mother. He belongs with me.
111) 42) dialog: Don't tell me what my son feels! He's coming with me and there isn't anything you can do about that.
111) 46) dialog: We'll see about that.
111) 51) dialog: I want to see my son!
113) 3) dialog: Kyle, honey, come in. I'm so glad you came.
113) 6) dialog: Have a seat, honey. Do you want a soda or something?
113) 12) dialog: I just wanted to say how sorry I was about the match and if I did anything to cause it then I will never forgive myself. I know how much wrestling means to you, baby.
113) 16) dialog: No. I also wanted to say that I'll do whatever you think is best for Leo. I promise.
113) 20) dialog: OK. I will. If that's what you want. But I have to be honest, I'm not sure that's what Leo wants.
113) 24) dialog: Here. Read this.
113) 31) dialog: It's the court transcript from when Leo was in court. My lawyer got it. Read the parts in yellow. See what it says.
113) 36) dialog: No, honey. This is official from the court. It's what Mike said.
113) 39) dialog: He gets paid for being Leo's guardian, Kyle. And then he just put him in that place so he didn't have to worry about him.
113) 42) dialog: Leo belongs with us, Kyle.
113) 47) dialog: Why what?
113) 52) dialog: Because we deserve that money, Kyle. Not some lawyer. You're a big boy. You can understand that.
126) 29) dialog: Hi. Is your deal still available?
126) 35) dialog: He can stay.
126) 41) dialog: And you'll send me the checks?
126) 45) dialog: You take good care of him.
126) 50) dialog: I want to say goodbye.
