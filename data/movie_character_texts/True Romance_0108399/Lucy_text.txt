2) 0) text: A smoky cocktail bar in downtown Detroit. CLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster, hepcat, is trying to pick up on an older lady named LUCY. She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's a little charmed. But, you can tell that she isn't going to leave her barstool.
2) 2) text: I love that scene where after he's made it big he's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highborws are there, and he's singing, 'Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care.' Now, they got him dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid lookin' pants, this horrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him wearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party, big house, stupid clothes, he's still a rude lookin' motherfucker. I'd watch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm no fag, but Elvis was good lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier than most women. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I mean had to cuz my life depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis. Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.
2) 3) dialog: I'd fuck Elvis.
2) 5) dialog: When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
2) 8) dialog: How 'bout me what?
2) 12) dialog: Who's Sonny Chiba?
2) 14) dialog: (not believing this) You wanna take me to a Kung Fu movie?
2) 16) dialog: (laughing) I don't think so. Not my cup of tea.
