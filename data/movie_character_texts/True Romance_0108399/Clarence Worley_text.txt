He turns his attention back to the screen, trying not to be so obvious. When Alabama gets right behind Clarence, her foot thunks a discarded wine bottle, causing her to trip and spill her popcorn all over Clarence.

6) 25) dialog: Is that your real name? Really?
6) 27) dialog: Well, cut my legs off and call me shorty. There's a pretty original moniker there, Alabama. Sounds like a Pam Grier movie. (announcer voice) She's a sixteen calibre kitten, equally equiped for killin' an lovin'.

9) 16) dialog: Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in The Black Hole? I always found it funny that somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Ernest Borgnine. He pulls out a plastic-encased Spiderman comic from the box.
9) 17) dialog: Spiderman, number one. The one that started it all. Clarence shows the comic book to Alabama.
9) 19) dialog: He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time. (pulls out another comic) Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandoes. One of the coolest series known to man. They're completely worthless. You can get number one for about four bucks. But that's one of the cool things about them, they're so cheap.

11) 0) text: Clarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion. Movie posters, pictures of Elvis, anything you can imagine. The sweaty lovebirds are soaking in a post-passion hot bath. By the look of the comfort they share, it would be hard to imagine that they met not five hours ago.
11) 2) dialog: You know a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died. 19.
11) 4) dialog: Yeah, she OD'd. But she wasn't on her last legs or anything. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was something wrong with what she took.
11) 6) dialog: That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men, she didn't trust them. She's having this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So she said no. And the guy says, ‘Look I really love you and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it.' So she did, and he did and he asked her and she said yes. And once they were engaged, he told her a secret about himself that she never knew; he was a millionaire.

13) 14) dialog: Yeah... I got a boss. I work at ‘Heroes For Sale.' It's a comic book store. It's great because most of the customers only come in to browse. So I can pretty much do...

13) 46) dialog: Did ya ever see The Chinese Professionals?
13) 48) dialog: Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer. We hear, O.S., the TV ANNOUNCER say:

20) 0) text: Clarence has a beat to his stride that says "confidence." But with each step into the dimly lit expanse, thoughts o “what the hell am I doing" begin creeping into his mind. In the b.g., against the dilapidated mansions, Clarence can see the eerie glow that at one time may have been fireflies... today it's crack pipes. Clarence approaches JUPITER, a diseased-looking dealer/ junkie who thinks Clarence is there to score.
21) 0) text: Clarence steps up to the massive door of the house. His heart's really racing now. He has the TV Guide that Alabama wrote the address on in his hand. He KNOCKS on the door using the HUGE KNOCKERS. Marty answers the door.

I don't like to dicker. I never have fun in Tijuana. That price is non- negotiable. What's in that envelope is for my peace of mind. My peace of mind is worth that much. Not one penny more, not one penny more. You could hear a pin drop in the room. Once Clarence started talking, Marty went on full alert. Drexl stopped eating and the whores stopped breathing. All eyes are on Drexl. Drexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope. It's empty.

23) 3) dialog: Help yourself. I got enough. I am fuckin' starvin'. I think I ordered one of everything. He stops and looks at her.
23) 4) dialog: I am so hungry. He starts eating french fries and hamburgers.
23) 6) dialog: Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, ‘If I can kill ‘em and get away with it, I'll do it.' I could. So I did.
23) 8) dialog: No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good. Alabama starts to cry. Clarence continues eating, ignorin her.

27) 15) dialog: (to Alabama) Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get ‘cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has is. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a food run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
27) 17) dialog: Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good? (to Cliff) What do you think would taste good?
27) 19) dialog: You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. (MORE )
27) 21) dialog: Chicken and beer, definitely, absolutely, without a doubt. (to Cliff) Where's a good chicken place around here?
27) 23) dialog: You don't know the chicken places around where you live? (to Alabama) Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is. He gives her some more money.
27) 24) dialog: This should cover it, Auggie- Doggie.
27) 26) dialog: Isn't she the sweetest God damned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
27) 28) dialog: Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her? You can tell by my face, can't ya?

30) 12) dialog: I'm your son.
30) 14) dialog: Look, Goddamnit, I never asked you for a Goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you did I ever ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did I ever get in your shit about it? No! It was always: ‘Okay,' 'No problem,' ‘You're a busy guy, I understand.’ The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. you see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problem. Alabama walks in through the door carrying a shopping bag

65) 6) dialog: You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it. It's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, was I ever wrong.
65) 8) dialog: It's probably the single best piece I've ever read about Elvis in my life.
65) 10) dialog: It tries to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired; Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
65) 12) dialog: Like look at her. She looks like she fell off of an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick. Clarence and the Subscriber laugh.

66) 17) dialog: Sweetheart? Cops are gonna be here any minute. She continues. He takes the gun away from her, and she falls to the ground.

It's like I always felt that the way she felt about me was a mistake. She couldn't really care that much. I always felt in the back of my mind, I don't know, she was joking. But, to go through that and remain loyal, it's very easy to be enraptured with words, but to remain loyal when it's easier, even excusable, not to -- that's a test of one's self. That's true romance. I swear to God, I'll cut off my hands and gouge out my eyes before I'll ever let anything happen to that lady again. cut TO:

78) 3) dialog: With a vengeance, I hated them.
78) 5) dialog: I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustrating to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anything about it. I didn't have any money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, and here I was livin' next to a airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin’ planes takin' off. I'm tryin' to watch TV, fuckin' planes takin' off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.

85) 7) dialog: I know that, Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it. Pause. Clarence stops walking.
85) 8) dialog: Hold it, guys. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty scared. What say we forget the whole thing? Dick and Alabama are both surprised and relieved.
85) 10) dialog: No. I don't really mean it. Well, I mean this is our last chance to think about it. How ‘bout you, 'Bama?
85) 12) dialog: It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside. 105.
85) 14) dialog: This is our last chance to play ‘what if.' I don't want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.

85) 19) dialog: I'm sorry, guys. I gotta do it. As petrified as I am, I just can't walk away. I'm gonna be kicking myself in the ass the rest of my life if I don't go in there. Lee Donowitz isn't a gangster lookin' to skin us and he's not a cop, he's a famous movie producer lookin' to get high. And I'm just the man who can get him there.

96) 1) dialog: Okay. With the .45 up against Elliot's head, Clarence puts his palm over the top of the gun to shield himself from the splatter. Alabama and Dick can't believe what he's gonna do.

101) 14) dialog: Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' those Soldier of Fortune poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wiseguy. So, if you want, I'll put my gun on the table.
101) 16) dialog: Oh, Mr. Donowitz -- 113.
101) 18) dialog: Okay, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you that Coming Home in a Body Bag is one of my favorite movies. After Apocalypse Now, I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.

107) 11) dialog: No thanks. Lee continues looking at the merchandise. Alabama writes something on her napkin with a pencil and slides the napkin over to Clarence. It says: "You're so cool" with a tiny heart drawn on the bottom of it. Clarence takes a pencil and draws an arrow through the heart. She takes the napkin and puts it in her pocket. Lee looks up.
109) 1) dialog: Well, Lee, it's like this. You're getting the bargain of a lifetime because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. You're used to dealin' with professionals. I'm nota professional. I'm a rank amateur. I could take that and I could cut it and I could sell it a little bit at a time and make a helluva lot more money. But, in order to do that, I'd have to become a drug dealer. I'm not a drug dealer. And I don't want to be a drug dealer. (MORE )
109) 3) dialog: Deal with cut-throat junkies, killers; worry about gettin' busted all the time.

I'ma punk kid who picked up a rock in the street, only to find out it's the Hope Diamond. It's worth a million dollars, but I can't get a million for it. But you can. So I'll sell it to you for a couple a' hundred thousand. You go make a million. It's all found money to me anyway. Me and my wife are minimum wage kids, two hundred thousand is the world.
