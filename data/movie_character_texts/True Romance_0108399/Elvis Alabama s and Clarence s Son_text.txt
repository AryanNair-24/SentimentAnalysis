2) 2) text: I love that scene where after he's made it big he's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highborws are there, and he's singing, 'Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care.' Now, they got him dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid lookin' pants, this horrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him wearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party, big house, stupid clothes, he's still a rude lookin' motherfucker. I'd watch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm no fag, but Elvis was good lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier than most women. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I mean had to cuz my life depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis.

16) 13) dialog: He don't got no right to live.
16) 15) dialog: I don't blame you.
16) 17) dialog: Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it is the easy part. Whaddya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it. Clarence looks at Elvis.

116) 7) dialog: That's why it don't come across as ass kissin', because it's genuine and he can see that. Elvis fixes Clarence's collar.
116) 8) dialog: I like ya, Clarence. Always have.
