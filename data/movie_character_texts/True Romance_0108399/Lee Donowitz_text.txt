38) 0) text: Dick's asleep in a reclining chair. He's wearing his clothes from the night before. His roommate FLOYD is lying on the sofa watching TV. The sound of four hands KNOCKING on his door wakes Dick up. He shakes the bats out of his belfry, and opens the door, and finds the cutest couple in Los Angeles standing in his doorway. Clarence and Alabama immediately start singing "Hello My Baby" like the frog in the old Chuck Jones cartoon.
45) 1) dialog: Hello. (pause) Elliot, it's Sunday. Why am I talking to you on Sunday? I don't see enough of you during the week, I gotta talk to you on Sunday? Why is it, you always --
47) 1) dialog: Why the hell are you calling my phone to talk about that?
49) 1) dialog: Are you out of your fucking mind?
52) 0) text: Clarence is still on the phone with Lee. 77.
53) 1) dialog: I don't know, Clarence. Dr. Zhivago's a pretty big movie.
55) 1) dialog: I'm not saying I'm not interested. But being a distributor's not what I'm all about. I'ma film producer. I'm on this world to make good movies. Nothing more. Now, having my big toe dipped into the distribution end helps me on Many levels. Traffic breaks and Lee speeds along. The b.g. whizzes past him.
55) 2) dialog: But the bottom line is -- I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributors I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish. End of story. Easy, businesslike, very little risk. 78.
57) 1) dialog: Well then, what's the hurry? Is it that the rights to Doctor Zhivago are in arbitration?
70) 0) text: Alabama, with a fat lip and a black and blue face, is asleep in bed.
101) 10) dialog: They're here. Who's who?
101) 13) dialog: Really?
101) 15) dialog: I don't think that will be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody. They all sit around a fancy glass table except for Boris, who's getting the coffee, and Monty, who stands behind Lee's chair.
101) 17) dialog: Lee, Clarence. Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
101) 19) dialog: Thank you very much, Clarence.
101) 21) dialog: I hear you talking, Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
101) 23) dialog: Clarence, there might be somebody somewhere that agrees with you more than I do, but I wouldn't count on it. Clarence is on a roll and he knows it.
103) 3) dialog: You know, Clarence, when a veteran of that bullshit war says that, it makes the whole project worthwhile. Clarence, my friend, and I call you my friend because we have similar interests, let's take a look at what you have for me.
107) 0) text: Lee's looking over the cocaine and sampling it.
107) 2) dialog: Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee?
107) 4) dialog: (stirring loudly) You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
107) 6) dialog: I have to hand it to you, this is not nose garbage. This is quality. Can Boris make anybody a sandwich? (MORE )
107) 8) dialog: I got all kinds of sandwich shit from Canter's in there.
107) 12) dialog: Okay, Clarence, the merchandise is perfect. But, whenever I'm offered a deal that's too good to be true, it's because it's a lie. Convince me you're on the level.
109) 4) dialog: Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
109) 6) dialog: Why does he trust you?
109) 8) dialog: If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
109) 10) dialog: That's wild. This fuckin' guy's a madman. I love it. Monty, go in the other room and get the money. Clarence, Alabama and Dick exchange looks. 118.
112) 1) dialog: (pointing to Alabama) What's your part in this?
112) 3) dialog: (veferring to Dick) How ‘bout you?
112) 5) dialog: And Elliot knows me. Monty brings in a briefcase with the money and puts it on the table.
112) 6) dialog: Wanna count your money?
115) 4) dialog: Monty, what are you talking about? Do what they say.
115) 8) dialog: Boris! Everybody's gonna get killed! They're cops!
115) 12) dialog: We don't want it. The four wiseguys burst through the door, shotguns drawn except for Frankie, who has two .45 automatics, one in each hand. Half the cops spin around.
117) 4) dialog: (to Elliot) How did you know his name? How the fuck did he know your name? Why, you fuckin' little piece of shit!
117) 7) dialog: Well, I hope you're not planning on acting in the next twenty years ‘cause your career is over, as of now. You might as well burn your SAG card! To think I treated you as a son! And you stabbed me in the heart! Lee can't control his anger anymore. He grabs the coffee pot off the table and flings hot coffee in Elliot's face. Elliot screams and falls to his knees. Instinctively, Nicholson SHOOTS Lee twice. Lee flops backwards over the couch and onto the floor. Alabama screams. Boris lets loose with the UZI, painting Nicholson red with BULLETS.
