43) 0) text: A beautiful sunny afternoon as all the postulants lay together in a field of grass, surrounding Sister Mary Grace. Sister Evelyn also in the midst of explaining...
43) 1) dialog: My mother always said at least one child should be sacrificed. Even though I come from a big family I’m still the only girl of 5 brothers, so I guess it was pretty obvious which one of us was gonna end up becoming a nun... I’m happy about it though. I’m just so proud to be here, showing all my devotion. I don’t care how hard it’s supposed to be, I just can’t wait til’ we all get into the Novitiate and get to wear those white veils. Some of the other girls smile and nod, as Mary Grace turns back to the group.
56) 6) dialog: Are you still going to be a member of the church? After you leave I mean? Mary Grace pauses for a long beat, unsure how to answer.
65) 1) dialog: 
68) 4) dialog: Me? Evelyn, I’m Sister Evelyn....
68) 6) dialog: I’m sorry, what...? I don’t understand? 63.
68) 8) dialog: No. I don’t know?... What do you mean?
68) 10) dialog: No, I’m not perfect.
68) 12) dialog: Yes... I mean yes, if I could...
68) 14) dialog: My... My... My faults, I guess?
68) 16) dialog: I guess so?
68) 18) dialog: Yes. I mean yes Mother, I agree.
68) 20) dialog: I’m untidy. What I mean is, I’m messy. Like sometimes when I look around my cell, with all my clothes all over the floor, I feel like I’m such a slob, and I need to do better... I space out a lot too, they used to call me ‘space cadet’ in school because I spaced out so much...
68) 22) dialog: The ways I fail.. I fail Christ.... A long, silent pause as Evelyn slowly begins to cry. SISTER EVELYN (CONT’D) There's part of me that wonders if I’m good enough to be here? If I deserve to be here or deserve anything good that happens to me... I want to be good, to be pure, and good. But I don’t know if that’s who I really am on the inside. And sometimes my thoughts inside don’t always match how I act on the outside. And sometimes I feel like I’m ugly and bad inside.... And I know I've let people down before too. I’ve let my parents down before, my ma and my dad... But I don't want to let him down Mother, I don’t want to let Jesus down. I don't want to fail him, ever... And I just hope he knows that I can do better, if he lets me... 65. Evelyn then stops, shaking uncontrollably and crying.
68) 24) dialog: (almost inaudible) Thank you Mother. As Evelyn's body finally relaxes, we see the tiniest hint of a smile on her face, more relief than anything else.
68) 26) dialog: Yes Mother, thank you Mother... Evelyn then starts to shuffle back to her place in line.
68) 28) dialog: I’m sorry... I thought I was done?
68) 34) dialog: No... I mean how would she even know what I did, if she hadn’t broken Custody of the Eyes to look at me? Before suddenly Candace yells at her!
68) 36) dialog: You did! You’re a liar! That’s a fault too!
68) 38) dialog: The what?
69) 2) dialog: What do you think?
69) 4) dialog: And do what? Tell my parents and everyone back home that I failed at being a nun. Clearly guilt ridden by her prior accusations, Candace then turns to Evelyn so empathetically.
69) 6) dialog: It's okay Sister, I know... I don’t think you’re a liar. I’m sorry too.
96) 2) dialog: Gone.
96) 4) dialog: Didn't you hear, they all left. Because of Vatican II.
101) 6) dialog: With the help of God, I’ve come to know in this community both the difficulty and joy of a life completely devoted to him. My desire is to make permanent profession within this community, and to wear the holy habit of the Clare.
101) 8) dialog: (shaky) I seek to take the vows of chastity, poverty and obedience. To give my life to God for all eternity, to be married forever to our Lord, Jesus Christ. The Priest makes the sign of the cross over her forehead.
