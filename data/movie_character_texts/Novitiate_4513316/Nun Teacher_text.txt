14) 0) text: Inside a small, traditional 1950s classroom- A billow of fabric then comes drifting along the floor, winding through a row of school desks. Two girls in the back giggle and pass notes, at the same time as an OLDER NUN TEACHER in full habit stops dead center, glances around at them all.
14) 1) dialog: Silence girls, silence. So I have a question for all of you- How many in this room were baptized Catholic? As the majority of girls then immediately shoot up their hands, Cathleen just looks at the ground. NUN TEACHER (CONT’D) Don’t worry, this isn’t a judgement on anyone’s background... The reason I ask, is because I’m wondering if any of you know what the difference is- Between the Catholic religion and all other religions? Protestants, Baptists, Jews? A few girls giggle, others roll their eyes and yawn. Before the Teacher finally goes to the board and slowly writes out: “LOVE AND SACRIFICE” 14. NUN TEACHER (CONT’D) Love and Sacrifice. Of course there are many different ways, that people choose to show gratitude to their Lord ... But I believe what differentiates the Catholic religion, from so many other religions, is the full extent we’re willing to go to demonstrate our passion... Because if there’s one thing we all know for sure, there’s just no such thing as true love without sacrifice. Seated in back, Cathleen looks up intrigued. As if something about this strange notion appeals to her.
