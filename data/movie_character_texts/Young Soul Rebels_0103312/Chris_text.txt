10) 13) text: CHRIS unfolds a piece of paper from his pocket.
10) 14) text: CHRIS
10) 17) text: Soul Patrol?  CHRIS 
10) 20) text: CHRIS has performed the patter and chat-up line, now he  makes to go. TRACY calls him back.
10) 22) text: You'll leave a name at the door?  CHRIS 
10) 24) text: Well, what is it?  CHRIS 
10) 27) text: CHRIS smiles. He and TRACY part, CHRIS breezes past the  SECURITY GUARDS.
11) 1) text: CHRIS walks across the Park. He keeps to the paths. There is an unease about him. The Park, the scene of the murder now the site of everyday park pleasures. A JOGGER pounds  past CHRIS, startling him.
11) 2) text: CHRIS passes a POLICEMAN.
11) 3) text: CHRIS finds his nine year old sister, TRISH. She's with t of her FRIENDS. They're some way from where the murder to place. A quick hug for CHRIS from TRISH. She and her  friends seem pleased to be talking to a 'big boy'. TRISH  jumps to touch the new haircut.
11) 5) text: Watcha, baldie!  CHRIS 
11) 7) text: Police wouldn't let us play over there.  Bloke got killed.  CHRIS 
11) 13) text: TRISH stops the dance and takes CHRIS to one side.
11) 16) text: CHRIS
11) 18) text: The three girls fall into line as CHRIS turns, kicks and  steps. Neat, precise movements. The girls are good. The actual song over the girls' legs as they do a formati soul dance step. Finally TRISH breaks off, runs to the  nearby bushes.  TRISH
11) 21) text: CHRIS
11) 23) text: TRISH holds the cassette player for CHRIS to see.
11) 26) text: CHRIS looks it over. Unimpressed.
11) 27) text: CHRIS
11) 30) text: Found it... Can yer sell it for us?  CHRIS 
11) 32) text: Please.  CHRIS

13) 3) text: CARLTON, Caz's brother, works on an engine in the middle the room, his overalls dirty with grease. As CHRIS enters, DAVIS, a young black man, wraps a small  parcel. He pulls out a betting slip to do the job. His  customer is a young, white punk, later identified as  BILLIBUDD.
13) 6) text: No suh! We don deal in chemicals. BILLIBUDD watches as CHRIS crosses from CARLTON to DAVIS, touching hands in greeting. CHRIS waits for BILLIBUDD to  leave before speaking.
13) 7) text: CHRIS 
13) 8) text: You 'eard about the murder in the Park? DAVIS kisses his teeth. He clearly doesn't want to talk  about it. CHRIS glances at BILLIBUDD.  CHRIS 
13) 11) text: CHRIS 
13) 13) text: DAVIS pulls out a plastic bag full of weed from his jacke and another betting slip. He sprinkles a cluster of weed  onto the slip before folding it up and handing it to CHRI CHRIS takes it in one hand, puts it to his nose and smell it.

13) 15) text: Go easy on the draw ya know Chris, min'  it don' lick aff ye 'ead!

13) 20) text: CHRIS
13) 23) text: Only see dat brudda o' mine when 'e wants  something... CHRIS tests the cassette recorder from the park. It seems to be broken. He flips out the tape and crosses to the  garage tapedeck.
13) 26) text: CHRIS 
13) 29) text: CHRIS
13) 41) text: Hey!  CHRIS 
13) 54) text: Since when you interested in our ideas  eh? Eh? But as you say you is why don't  you go and check your skinhead friends  first?  CHRIS 
14) 1) text: CAZ is stretched out on Chris's bed. He looks intense,  absorbed. He swigs whisky from a bottle. Jean Carn: 'Don't Let It Go To Your Head' on the stereo.
14) 2) text: CHRIS comes in.  CHRIS 
14) 5) text: CHRIS sits down beside him, notices the half-empty bottle but says nothing about it.
14) 6) text: CHRIS
14) 8) text: CHRIS picks up the Contempo record bag. Tips it up, looks through the records.
14) 9) text: CHRIS

14) 15) text: Mnnn... mnnn...  CHRIS
14) 18) text: You actually met Jeff Kane?  CHRIS
14) 21) text: Yeah, yeah. What'd he say?  CHRIS 
14) 24) text: CHRIS selects a record to play. He looks at one of the ne ones, it's in a blank, white sleeve.
14) 25) text: CHRIS 
14) 27) text: That's a rejects, ain't it? All the big  labels are binning the records now -  well, they can't get the black bands on  tele, so they can't be bothered to  promote 'em.  CHRIS 
14) 29) text: CHRIS half-dances to the new record. He still has some of the others in his hand.
14) 30) text: CHRIS 
14) 32) text: I can't keep shelling out, can I Chris?  We're gonna have to get some  advertisin'... CHRIS

16) 2) text: Mnn... yup... yup... ANN, Chris's mother, a white woman in her thirties, puts  her head round the door. She looks to be halfway through  getting ready for a night out.
16) 6) text: ANN looks to CHRIS.
16) 8) text: So 'ow did yer get on?  CHRIS 
16) 10) text: Well yer went, didn't yer? What did he  apply for Caz?  CHRIS

16) 18) text: CHRIS
16) 21) text: CHRIS
16) 23) text: ANN grabs CHRIS by the ear.  ANN

16) 29) text: ANN smacks the side of CHRIS's head. 
16) 31) text: An' if you touch my catalogue money  again...  CHRIS 
16) 33) text: CHRIS passes her a spliff.
16) 52) text: CAZ leaves. ANN slaps CHRIS's leg to demand attention. Sh holds up the spliff for him to light.
17) 10) text: 19 INT. CHRIS's FLAT - EVENING
17) 12) text: CHRIS is stretched out, trying to push himself into a pai of tight, black leather trousers. He tugs the zip. They'r at least two sizes too small.  Later: CHRIS has changed his mind... he zips up red leath trousers. He's happier with the effect.
18) 19) text: 21 INT. CHRIS's FLAT - NIGHT
18) 20) text: On the stereo the end of Eddie Henderson: 'Say You Will'. CHRIS dances to the music, he's still getting ready.
18) 21) text: CAZ appears at the doorway. Unnoticed he watches CHRIS  dance.
18) 22) text: CAZ enjoys the sight of CHRIS changing, the successive  revealing and concealing of flesh as CHRIS tries to settl on a shirt.
18) 24) text: You're getting thinner...  CHRIS 
18) 27) text: CAZ nods approval at the final selection of shirt. CHRIS  checks out his overall look in the mirror. He's satisfied
18) 29) text: CAZ and CHRIS haul records out onto the balcony. They sto to briefly hug. Part of the building up for the night.  They're off...
19) 1) text: But as CAZ and CHRIS head for the car, the gang is again evidence. BIGGSY is perched on Caz's car bonnet.
19) 2) text: CHRIS hits BIGGSY with a record case.
19) 3) text: CHRIS
19) 7) text: CHRIS hits KELLY with the record case.
19) 9) text: Oi, watch the cloth, moth!  CHRIS 
19) 13) text: Bit wound up, aren't we? Wot you need is  a party, Chris. Comin' to our little  Jubilee get togewer? You could wear your  white suit, an' I'll wear mine...

19) 15) text: CHRIS
19) 17) text: CHRIS has to push his way to the car, knocking BIGGSY asi
19) 19) text: Oh steady, rocky...  CHRIS joins CAZ in the car.  CHRIS 
19) 21) text: CAZ hands a spliff to CHRIS.
20) 3) text: CHRIS
20) 7) text: CHRIS isn't totally convinced.
20) 8) text: CHRIS
20) 10) text: No, but if'e has had anything to do wiv  it, I'll break his fucking neck.  CHRIS
21) 3) text: CAZ and CHRIS move towards a raised altar-like platform.  Two female PUNK DJs are behind the decks, playing X-Ray  Spex: 'Oh Bondage Up Yours', a strong punk dance number:
21) 5) text: There is a bit of banter between CHRIS, CAZ and the punk  DJs as CAZ sets up a second table, ready to fadeout the  X-Ray Spex. CHRIS digs through his record collection. He  selects The Players Association: 'I Like It?'
21) 6) text: CHRIS 
21) 7) text: This is Chris...  CAZ 
21) 8) text: And this is Caz.  CHRIS and CAZ 
21) 9) text: Soul Patrol.  CHRIS 
21) 14) text: CHRIS and CAZ touch hands as they see the crowd get down. They're at their closest in creating the club atmosphere. People join in and add to the music - with whistles,  tambourines and shouted 'whoop/whoop' sounds.
21) 15) text: TRACY and JILL from Metro Radio arrive, unseen by Chris.  They stand at the edge of the dancefloor. TRACY looks a  little out of place here, her South Molton Street style  too upmarket for this crowd. She is a bit older, a bit  classier, less street.
21) 16) text: JILL might be the right class, but her clothes are marked high-street. She openly stares at the clubgoers, it's cle she hasn't been to a club like it. JILL and TRACY knock  back their fist drinks. JILL, in for a penny attitude,  pulls TRACY to the dancefloor. CHRIS sees the two women making their way through the  dancers, finding a space. TRACY edges their dance towards the DJ rostrum. Towards CHRIS. CHRIS goes down to meet  them, without saying a word to CAZ. He dances alone at first, he's a good, vain, self-absorbe dancer. He dances alone till he knows TRACY'S attention i firmly on him. He then breaks the pose and steers himself close...
21) 17) text: CAZ watches as the trio of CHRIS, JILL and TRACY forms.
21) 18) text: CHRIS looks across to CAZ at the deck, breaks from the  dance. TRACY continues to dance with JILL, but watches as CHRIS rejoins CAZ at the deck. CAZ and TRACY exchange loo JILL is distracted by styles and colours, ears pierced wi multiple ear-rings, 'granny shoes', tight jeans, baggy  trousers tightened at the ankles, plastic sandals, cowboy boots, pointed shoes, collarless shirts, ripped fish-net  stockings, jackets made out of plastic bags, maxi-skirts, mini-skirts... and that's just the soul crowd! A PUNK the catches her attention, he wears a pair of Union Jack brie tacked to his jacket. He notices as she laughs.
21) 19) text: TRACY tries to smile at CHRIS, but CAZ is in the way, and when he's with CAZ, CHRIS seems to be avoiding her.
21) 21) text: The pattern on the dancefloor changes. People form two  circles. In the first - two black boys and a white boy. I the second - a black boy and black girl. We lose sight of JILL and TRACY. CHRIS and CAZ sort through their records, CHRIS keeps an eye open for TRACY. It's a while before he speaks.
21) 22) text: CHRIS
21) 26) text: CHRIS
21) 29) text: Oh.  CHRIS
21) 32) text: She's well out of your league. What ya  ask her down 'ere for?  CHRIS 
21) 34) text: Na. Nice to be liberated, ain't it?  CHRIS 
21) 38) text: CHRIS leaves CAZ at the turntable. CHRIS pushes through t dancers, disappointed not to see TRACY. Quite close to th DJ platform there's a small group of PUNKS. BILLIBUDD, th punk who tried to score at the garage, is one of them.
21) 40) text: CHRIS sees JILL and the PUNK, he laughs as she interrogat the soft-spoken, middle-class, art-school boy. JILL knock back the drink. She nods at CHRIS but her attention is on the two men behind him - the men are kissing.
21) 41) text: CHRIS finds TRACY. She's talking to the PUNK DJs. He  hovers, waiting for a chance to speak to her alone. KEN,  the equipment dealer, bumps into CHRIS. KEN looks out of  place in the club, he's more an East End pub disco type. manages to slop beer onto CHRIS's shirt in the crush near the makeshift bar.
21) 42) text: CHRIS
21) 46) text: Sorry... Sorry... Thought I'd come and  check the club... spoke to Caz 'bout the  aerial today... I'm working on it. Look,  let me get you a drink...  CHRIS 
21) 48) text: What, yer busy ?  CHRIS 
21) 50) text: CHRIS is clearly annoyed about the shirt, and he wants to be on his own with TRACY. KEN gets the message and leaves CHRIS turns to face TRACY.  CHRIS 
21) 55) text: CHRIS 
21) 57) text: You're not going to join us?  CHRIS 
21) 59) text: CHRIS smiles and leaves, pushing through to the bar.  Everybody knows him. He turns down the gestured 'Let's  dance' from two guys doing the bump at the edge of the  dancefloor. DISSOLVE: To much later in the evening.
21) 76) text: CHRIS, seeking TRACY out, interrupts.
21) 77) text: CHRIS 
21) 79) text: A punk in red, white and blue underpants!  CHRIS 
21) 89) text: Later: CHRIS and TRACY in mid-conversation.
21) 91) text: ...  I  don't know...  I want to extend  it to clubs.  What's really happening.  They've got no idea at Metro. The  programme is dead.  CHRIS 
21) 93) text: I'm suggesting that you make up a tape,  and leave the introductions to me.  CHRIS 
21) 95) text: I'm sick of being a PA I want to make  some changes Chris. Are you interested?  CHRIS 
21) 99) text: LATER IN THE EVENING. CHRIS at the decks. JILL and TRACY  dancing together, JILL getting a bit out of order,  enjoying herself hugely.
21) 105) text: CAZ laughs at the 'girl'. He looks over to a fairly quiet dancefloor, then up to CHRIS. CHRIS catches the look.
22) 1) text: CAZ and CHRIS carry record cases through the churchyard t the nearby sidestreet. They pass TWO PUNK WOMEN kissing.  Jill's UNDERPANT PUNK sits looking startling and miserabl on a tombstone. Most of the club crowd have gone. They're still half dancing as they pack up for the night.
22) 2) text: CHRIS
22) 6) text: CHRIS
22) 9) text: So what you up to now Chris?  CHRIS
22) 11) text: CHRIS goes back to fetch the rest of the records. CAZ kno he's up to something, and he's annoyed about it. A COUPLE of MEN stagger up to the car.  MAN 1 
22) 13) text: Look at that car, man! CAZ jumps in the car and drives off. CHRIS is stranded wi four boxes of records.  CHRIS 
22) 15) text: TRACY is parked across the road, she laughs at his burst temper. CHRIS steps to the car, leans in at the open wind
22) 17) text: What's with your friend?... Need a lift?  CHRIS 
22) 19) text: Sure.  CHRIS 
22) 22) text: TRACY gets out, opens the boot. CHRIS puts the records in
22) 23) text: CHRIS 
22) 26) text: Doing it with that punk!  CHRIS 
22) 31) text: So where to?  CHRIS 
22) 33) text: What do you mean?  CHRIS 
22) 35) text: CHRIS gets in the passenger seat. TRACY drives...
23) 1) text: Torchlight. Searching the cluttered shelves. The light  rests on T.J.'s cassette player where CHRIS left it.
25) 1) text: TRACY and CHRIS stumble through the garage in the dark.  They're laughing, a bit drunk.
25) 3) text: Well, there's not much to it, is there?  Through here?  CHRIS 
25) 5) text: God, it reminds me... I used to listen to  Caroline a lot... I even remember Radio 390, the R & B show.  CHRIS 
25) 8) text: TRACY knocks the punch-bag at CHRIS.
25) 9) text: CHRIS 
25) 11) text: CHRIS leads her through the broken down car, into the  hidden pirate radio base.
25) 14) text: Once they're through to the base, CHRIS seems awkward.
25) 15) text: CHRIS 
25) 18) text: They kiss. CHRIS is all for going further.
25) 20) text: Hey, I've got work in the morning. And  you're gonna make me a tape, remember?  CHRIS 
27) 2) text: Listen... I was there... he mugged him.  His name's Chris Morgan. I think he lives  on the Ladywell... No - I can't give  my... no names... right?... No... no.
28) 1) text: CHRIS runs the tap of a makeshift shower. He sticks his  head under it. He notices the big beer stain on his shirt He takes the shirt off, tries to get the stain out with  soap. It won't go.
28) 3) text: CHRIS
28) 6) text: CHRIS
28) 9) text: CUT TO: CHRIS reaches for a fag, but he's out. He seems  stuck for an idea. Finally he remembers the tape his sist gave him. He looks across to where he left the cassette  recorder. He notices it has been moved, he's not unduly  concerned.
29) 1) text: CHRIS, exhausted, lies back on a car seat. He runs his hands over his chest, over the crotch of his  jeans. There's someone watching, unnoticed. We see CHRIS  touching himself from an unidentified POV
31) 1) text: A MAN'S gloved hand. A tense, stealthy movement of the MA through the garage.... CHRIS's feet protrude from the  backseat of the winched up car. He's fast asleep. The MAN head is covered with a metal mask.
31) 2) text: The gloved hand grabs at Chris's feet, making him jump... But the hand is DAVIS's the gloves, work gloves. The mask for car repair/welding.
31) 4) text: Yo!  CHRIS
31) 8) text: DAVIS has arrived for work, CARLTON follows him in. CARLT stares at CHRIS'S footwear.
31) 11) text: CHRIS is not in the mood, he looks at his watch.

32) 3) text: CHRIS half-recognises him from the garage. He catches hol of BILLIBUDD'S lapel, peers at the badges: various  distorted images of the Royal Family, Mary Whitehouse wit 'Gay News Fights On' across her features, Punk badges,  Grunwick support, Stuff the Jubilee... But CHRIS takes  issue with one badge in particular.
32) 4) text: CHRIS
32) 8) text: CHRIS
32) 12) text: He hands CHRIS a 'Fuck the Jubilee' concert flyer. A list of bands.

33) 1) text: CHRIS talks to JILL at reception.
33) 2) text: CHRIS
33) 6) text: CHRIS looks at his watch. He's restless, impatient.
33) 9) text: Ready for the verdict?  CHRIS 
33) 11) text: Stop worrying Chris. I told him you made  the tape up last night. It's only an  impression he's after. I think I'm  getting somewhere with this club idea...  And, er... can you keep quiet about your  pirate credentials? He's dead set against  that.  CHRIS 
34) 1) text: CHRIS and TRACY walk into a studio to find DAVE, a white, middle-aged, middle-class producer, listening to Chris's  voice on tape.
34) 3) text: Hi Dave, this is Chris Morgan.
34) 6) text: Take a pew Chris. Yes, well, nice choice  of music, if a bit obscure. But you come  over well. It's just that it's a bit, um  - how shall I say, er - casual. I mean  not everybody will understand what you're  trying to convey. I like it, but the  powers that be... Listen, Chris - to be  honest with you - if we were to take you  on as a presenter - out and about in the  clubs... if we were - and that's a big if  - we'd be looking for a more recognisable  style, something a bit more... um... CHRIS 
34) 9) text: CHRIS performs a DJ act, imaginary microphone in hand.
34) 10) text: CHRIS
34) 15) text: You stupid arrogant fuck! I went out of  my way to get you in here. Bang goes my idea.  CHRIS 
34) 17) text: I just can't believe this punk,  'no-future' attitude.  CHRIS 
34) 21) text: TRACY catches CHRIS by the arm and leads him to the door.
35) 0) text: TRACY leads CHRIS into a cramped office, picks up a  cardboard box and places it on the desk.
35) 9) text: CHRIS 
36) 2) text: CHRIS walks quickly down the steps that lead into  Reception. He gives the Queen's waving arm a sharp chop.
37) 1) text: CHRIS, hot and restless, wanders the park. Finally he  settles by the pond. Near a YOUNG FAMILY.
37) 4) text: CHRIS lays back on the grass, to rest and think things  over...
37) 5) text: Later: CHRIS still stretched out on the grass. TWO  SUNBATHING WOMEN to the side of him.
37) 6) text: A man stands menacingly over CHRIS. He looks down on  CHRIS's vulnerable, sleeping form. CHRIS's eyes open,  startled. He looks first at the man, now recognisable as  the plainclothed CID MAN, then at the back-up: TWO 
37) 11) text: The POLICEMEN converge on CHRIS, pull him to his feet.  CHRIS 
38) 1) text: KELLY, the mixed-race skinhead from the estate is let out of the station as CHRIS is led in. KELLY smirks at CHRIS. CHRIS is confused. A POLICEMAN hurries CHRIS into the  station.
39) 0) text: Close on CHRIS's socks.
39) 1) text: Part-way into an interrogation. CHRIS is facing the CID M over a table. Both are seated. The PAR)( POLICEMAN takes  notes. The CID MAN ducks his head down to look at Chris's feet.
39) 3) text: What sort of socks are those?  CHRIS 
39) 5) text: I said... What sort of socks are those?  CHRIS 
39) 8) text: CHRIS bends down, undoes his shoes, pulls off a loud  fluorescent sock and drops it slowly onto the table.
39) 10) text: Listen smartarse, no monkey business. You  don't seem to realise, do you? You're not  in here for showing disrespect to Her  Majesty at Metropolitan Radio. No, nor  for running your jungle bunny club on  hallowed grounds, neither.  CHRIS 
39) 13) text: CHRIS is increasingly uneasy.
39) 16) text: This knowledge seems to worry CHRIS more than  anything so far.
39) 17) text: CHRIS 
39) 20) text: CHRIS is shocked almost to the point of nervous laughter.
41) 1) text: CHRIS has lost much of his earlier spark. The questioning is wearing him down.
41) 3) text: Are you gonna tell us? Where were you the  night before last?  CHRIS 
41) 7) text: This catches CHRIS off-guard. If he tells them he and CAZ were broadcasting, then it gives the pirate away. Now he  has to lie.
41) 8) text: CHRIS
41) 10) text: The CID MAN opens a cupboard. He takes the badly burnt  cassette recorder out of a plastic bag. He holds it (in  gloved hands) to CHRIS's face.
41) 13) text: CHRIS is now totally unnerved, he has handled the recorde but if he says he has...
41) 14) text: CHRIS 
41) 17) text: CHRIS looks across to the PARK POLICEMAN, furious at what appears to be a set-up, and furious that Trish has been  involved. He shouts out.
41) 18) text: CHRIS 
41) 21) text: CHRIS can't take it. He screams out.
41) 22) text: CHRIS 
41) 24) text: CHRIS thumps on the table... repeats his demand over and  over... his movements restrained by a POLICEMAN.
41) 27) text: The CID MAN lights a cigarette, and casually leaves. A  POLICEMAN places the phone in front of CHRIS and leaves.  CHRIS is left on his own. He picks up the phone, tries a number, mutters 'Caz, Caz' into the receiver. Panic in his voice. There is no reply. He slams down the receiver. Picks it up again and dials.
41) 29) text: CHRIS
42) 25) text: Now what ya sayin'? What, 'cos Chris is my mate? Or 'cos I mix with white peop...  DAVIS 
43) 1) text: CHRIS and a SOLICITOR leave the station.
43) 2) text: CHRIS
43) 5) text: TRACY looks across to CHRIS.
43) 6) text: CHRIS still looks shaken, surprised at the sudden release He holds his stomach, he has been roughed up.
43) 8) text: You've been nothin' but trouble Chris.  You screw up at Metro and then you have  the nerve to drag me down here.  CHRIS 
43) 10) text: Chris, are you listening to me?  CHRIS 
43) 12) text: You've got to give it in, Chris.  CHRIS 
43) 14) text: Look, I'm no friend of the police, but if  it's evidence you're dealing with, you  don't mess with it.  CHRIS 
43) 17) text: CHRIS looks disconsolate and confused.
43) 19) text: You look pathetic... Come on... I'll drop  you off.  CHRIS climbs into the cab, TRACY pulls the door shut.
44) 0) text: CHRIS plays the Park tape.
44) 11) text: KEN crawls through the broken down car that blocks the ba of the garage, the pirate base, to where CHRIS is listeni to the tape.
44) 14) text: CHRIS is startled by KEN.
44) 16) text: Chris... Brought you something... it's  out the front... Give us a hand, it's a  bit 'eavy... YOUNG BLACK MAN 
44) 17) text: (on tape)  Terry, friends call me T.J. CHRIS turns off the tape, ejects and pockets it.
44) 18) text: CHRIS 
45) 1) text: CHRIS and CAZ carry a new aerial onto the roof, CHRIS at  the front, CAZ at the back. They negotiate an awkward hat that leads up on to the roof. They're sweating. On the  roof - they clap hands in air. They rest on a ledge.
45) 4) text: CHRIS 
45) 6) text: They set to work, laughing at the thought. But CHRIS is  still distracted, tense after the police questioning.  Thinking back.
45) 7) text: CHRIS
45) 11) text: CHRIS steps towards a pole, holds the new aerial against  the pole. It's right at the edge of the rooftop. CAZ stan by with a roll of heavy-duty sticking tape.
45) 14) text: CHRIS
45) 16) text: CHRIS is still shaky from the interrogation. Dangerously  close to the edge. Suddenly CHRIS slips, hangs over the  side of the tower block. He screams out.
45) 18) text: CHRIS clings to the aerial, CAZ grabs him, carefully pull him back to safety.
45) 20) text: You were nearly a gonna, man! Right, no  more time up 'ere, let's just do the ting  and get down.  CHRIS 
45) 23) text: CHRIS 
45) 25) text: Are you serious? You been crawlin' round  Metro again?  CHRIS 
45) 27) text: (mimics Chris)  'Some steady money in'. I got us the  fuckin' aerial, right? You think I like  doing Ken favours? Draggin' me bruwer  into it? Carlton's gonna let a car go  cheap for me and you, ya know...  CHRIS 
45) 29) text: Chris, I'm just sayin'. We are gettin  through  there's an audience buildin'.  We'll get the advertisin' and we'll 'ave  the money...  CHRIS 
45) 32) text: CHRIS suddenly puts his arm round CAZ.
45) 33) text: CHRIS 
45) 35) text: I can't tomorrow. Said I'd play the  concert tomorrow wiv that punk I met -  Billibudd.  CHRIS 
45) 38) text: CHRIS jumps back up to the aerial.
45) 39) text: CHRIS 
45) 42) text: Where's the loyalty in you going behin'  ma back, struttin' roun' Metro, prattlin'  bout what we're doin? Ain't you got no  sense? A quick word wiv the Home Office  and they can 'ave a station like ours  wiped out before breakfast... I thought  I was supposed to be your main man?  CHRIS 
45) 44) text: Cry on Tracy's shoulder...  CHRIS 
45) 46) text: CHRIS turns to the aerial...
45) 49) text: CAZ leaves the roof. CHRIS calls after him.
45) 50) text: CHRIS
45) 54) text: CAZ leaves the roof, furious. He doesn't hear Chris's  words, or see the Park tape that CHRIS takes out from his pocket...
45) 55) text: CHRIS
50) 3) text: Makes me feel like a criminal, sneaking  in here at night!  CHRIS 
50) 7) text: CHRIS lays his jacket down on a skylight. He sits on his  jacket. TRACY joins him. They looks over the city.
51) 8) text: I've been thinkin'... about Soul  Patrol... me and Chris, it ain't workin'.  Told you about him getting nicked today,  didn't I? Well I wasn't exactly  sympathetic. BILLIBUDD 
51) 14) text: Yeah, well, I did sleep with Chris for a  coupla months. His Mum was in hospital at  the time, having Trish, his little  sister. Chris stayed over at my house...
52) 0) text: TRACY and CHRIS kiss. TRACY unbuttons Chris's shirt. She strokes his chest, pushes the shirt off his shoulders
52) 1) text: She runs her fingers across his crotch. Slowly she moves  astride him, pulling back her long skirt. CHRIS quickly  undoes his flies. CHRIS moans and mutters as they make  love. TRACY is half touched by his words, half laughing. For a  moment she breaks the rhythm.  TRACY
53) 2) text: TRACY at the control desk. The Park cassette is in a  machine. CHRIS and TRACY listen, TRACY adjusts controls f optimum sound.
53) 12) text: Close on the glowing red studio clock.  TRACY switches the machine off.  CHRIS 
53) 16) text: CHRIS 
53) 18) text: Game's over, Chris. It is weird, I don't  like it.  CHRIS 
53) 20) text: Look, if that's what that tape sounds  like, you've got to hand it over.  CHRIS 
53) 27) text: Yeah... Later: Close up: CHRIS packages a copy of the tape.
53) 32) text: CHRIS seals the flap. TRACY watches. They kiss. CHRIS picks up his jacket.
55) 1) text: CHRIS moves towards the radio base at the back of the  garage. He calls for CAZ. There is no reply.
55) 3) text: Shards of broken cassette boxes crack under CHRIS's feet. Yet the records and the equipment are left intact. CHRIS totally unnerved. Nevertheless he climbs through the wrecked car entry to t pirate base. He switches the turntable. He carefully  selects a record, steadying himself. Puts on headphones. He picks up the mike, begins to play Funkadelic: 'One  Nation Under A Groove'. His voice is fragmented, shocked. CHRIS 
55) 7) text: CHRIS cries.
56) 21) text: CHRIS on his own.
56) 24) text: Hi... blimey... what 'appened?  CHRIS 
56) 26) text: D'yer call the police?  CHRIS shakes his head,'No'.  CHRIS 
56) 27) text: Nah, it's no use... no use...  KEN calmly closes in on CHRIS. Suddenly KEN smashes out, pushing CHRIS over the desk...  CHRIS 
56) 30) text: KEN has CHRIS by the throat, he tightens his grip.  KEN 
56) 31) text: Always thought you were so smart, didn't  yer? Well I set you up... I set you up  nicely... CHRIS struggles... KEN's speech is disjointed, a struggle to force the words out...  KEN 
56) 33) text: KEN pulls CHRIS round to face him. He grips CHRIS's face.
56) 35) text: You pretty boy... You had to stick yer  nose in. Gimme the tape, Chris ...give me  the fucking tape!  CHRIS 
56) 37) text: CHRIS summons all his force to push KEN off. They fall to the ground fighting.  CHRIS kicks out. Kicks KEN in the face... CHRIS dives through the car at the back of the garage...  runs towards the street...
56) 41) text: ANN, CHRIS's mother, walks through the estate. She's  cornered by an elderly BLUERINSED WHITE WOMAN.
56) 73) text: Did you 'ear Chris on the radio?  CAZ 
56) 77) text: Why ain't yer workin' wiv 'im today, Caz?  You alright, you and Chris?
58) 3) text: Flags flutter in the wind. The wind's dry metallic sound. CHRIS runs into the estate. Just a few JUBILEE STRAGGLERS are left, a couple heading  drunkenly home, a couple clearing the mess from their  doorsteps. CHRIS kicks a can along the ground.  QUEEN 
58) 5) text: CHRIS collides with an abandoned pram... it rolls across  the courtyard. KEN's voice still in his head.
58) 7) text: Give me the tape Chris. Give me the  fucking tape.
58) 10) text: CHRIS looks round the estate, searching. Finally he runs  out.
59) 4) text: Caz... You're Caz, aren't you? Chris's  other half, er, DJ spa, right? We never  did get properly introduced at the Club.  Where is he? Have you seen him?  CAZ 
59) 9) text: Chris was on the air this afternoon. It  seems he got cut off. Metro had any  pirates taken off the air lately, has it?  TRACY
60) 1) text: CHRIS returns to the estate, still searching. Bunting  dropped from a balcony falls across his path. A voice calls out to him.  VOICE
60) 3) text: CHRIS looks up to see SPARKY, KELLY and BIGGS.
60) 4) text: Closing in on him. CHRIS walks straight up to KELLY.
60) 5) text: CHRIS 
60) 8) text: Oh dear, I forgot to wear me white suit. CHRIS looks him up and down: the shaved head, Union Jack  t-shirt, the patriotic skinstyle.
60) 9) text: CHRIS
60) 15) text: CHRIS
60) 20) text: CHRIS 
60) 21) text: Ain't nothing to me, it's only yerself  yer connin'. SPARKY smiles, enjoys CHRIS and KELLY arguing it out  amongst themselves. CHRIS knows SPARKY would relish a  fight.
60) 22) text: Instead CHRIS walks up to KELLY, he grabs him, pulls him  close. CHRIS is too angry to be worried by any of them.
60) 23) text: CHRIS
60) 26) text: I ain't seen him, Chris. Honest.
60) 27) text: CHRIS lets go of KELLY, KELLY stumbles backwards. SPARKY crashes a milk bottle to the ground, it smashes  close to CHRIS.
60) 28) text: CHRIS starts to scream out.
60) 29) text: CHRIS
60) 31) text: The SKINS are confused and angered by Chris's behaviour,  there's none of the usual banter. Neighbours come out of  their doors, look down from their balconies. So many eyes on them, the gang can't risk a fight. CHRIS keeps calling for Caz. Even SPARKY is unnerved.
61) 1) text: CHRIS runs into the Park. He pushes through punks and hippy-types. Still shouting.  CHRIS 
61) 3) text: There are heaps of banners and placards round the edge of the Park. Emblems of the Socialist Workers' Party, labour groups and trades' councils, mixed with the punkier  graphics of the Anti-Nazi League. A sharp contrast to the Estate Jubilee decorations. CHRIS stumbles through the  placards.
61) 4) text: In the distance, a stage. A 'Fuck The Jubilee' banner  emblazoned across it. A short way from the main crowd,  CHRIS spots TRACY and JILL. JILL is dancing with TWO BLAC WOMEN. Live music from an Asian band fills the Park.
61) 5) text: TRACY catches sight of CHRIS.
61) 7) text: There's Chris... Chris!...
61) 8) text: CHRIS calls out to TRACY, TRACY leaves the WOMEN to reach him. A blur of extraordinary images, seen selectively, in fragments, through Chris's anxious eyes. The 'Fuck the  Jubilee' is as much a pageant as the Jubilee itself. Peop are decked out in masks, in parodies of Jubilee costumes. CHRIS pushes past the ASIAN GIRL PUNK, seen earlier with  Billibudd leafleting the tube. She is dressed as Britanni with spear and shield - an outfit to offend just about  everybody.  The ASIAN PUNK GIRL's friends wear satiric and grotesque  masks - of Callaghan, Steel...
61) 9) text: Others wear clothes featuring distorted images of the Roy Family. A small group wear cardboard corgi masks. Finally TRACY reaches CHRIS.
61) 11) text: Chris!
61) 12) text: CHRIS grabs hold of her arms. A panic in him.
61) 13) text: CHRIS 
61) 15) text: Ssshhh... Slow down, Chris. Slow down.  What are you talking about, who's Ken?  CHRIS 
61) 17) text: No Chris. No more. We're going. Have you  seen all the police? Vans loads of 'em,  all round the park. I don't like the look  of it...  CHRIS 
61) 19) text: CHRIS grabs TRACY, she sees all the fear in him and  follows. They head for the stage... 
61) 25) text: CHRIS and TRACY in the crowd. SKINS steam into the  crowd... kicking people to the ground... CHRIS gets  pushed... he loses TRACY.
61) 26) text: CHRIS 
61) 40) text: Takes the Park cassette out of his back pocket. Screams  into the microphone. The chill sound of KEN and T.J. in t opening scene, now broadcast across the Park.  CHRIS 
61) 56) text: CHRIS raises his arms to shield his face from the flames. He sees KEN coming towards him.
61) 58) text: CHRIS manages to jump off the stage just before the whole structure goes up in flame. Screams from the crowd....
61) 61) text: JILL cries. TRACY holds her, steadies her. But there's also rage on TRACY'S face. Rage at the  destruction.  CHRIS finds them...  CHRIS 
61) 63) text: Not far away from CHRIS and TRACY, CAZ has covered his  ears in horror. BILLIBUDD touches CAZ's face. BILLI tries to comfort him.
61) 65) text: It's alright... CAZ and CHRIS finally see each other...  CAZ 
61) 66) text: Chris... Chris...
61) 67) text: CHRIS leaves TRACY.  CHRIS 
61) 68) text: Don't go. I'll be back. CHRIS and CAZ step towards each other.
61) 69) text: CHRIS 
61) 70) text: Caz, thank Christ...
61) 71) text: BILLIBUDD watches the meeting of CAZ and CHRIS.
63) 2) text: They've set up a kind of record repair production line.  TRACY takes the polished records, passes them onto CHRIS  and CAZ at the turntable. CAZ and CHRIS test the records  for playability, for scratches.
63) 3) text: CHRIS turns to CAZ.  CHRIS 
63) 9) text: The records continue to pass from hand to hand... JILL  steps out of the line to dance... TRACY joins JILL in the dance. BILLIBUDD leaves the records to dance with TRACY and JILL CAZ moves from the turntable to join the dance...  CHRIS joins them...
