13) 11) dialog: Selling guns to Aidid's militia.
13) 13) dialog: (laughs) It's ah, it's the 0.K. Corral.
13) 15) dialog: (simply) You know where he sleeps. You pay for his beds, much less his militia. (the bottom line) We're not leaving Somalia until we find him. And we will find him.
13) 17) dialog: Well, I wouldn't know about that, I'm from Texas. (CONTINUED)
13) 21) dialog: (finally rips off his sunglasses) 300,000 dead and counting; That's_ not a war, Mr. Atto, that's genocide. Now you enjoy that tea, you hear? Garrison exits swiftly past two U.S. Marine guards.

Two tier one personalities may be present. (points to two enlarged photos) Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor; and Abdi Hassan Awale interior minister. These are the guys we're after.

53) 1) dialog: I'll fuckin' shoot him myself a couple of blocks down. Tell him I want his skinny ass parked in front of the damn building. He's not getting paid until he does exactly that.
56) 2) dialog: The last one of these guys shot | himself in the head playing Russian Roulette in a bar.
