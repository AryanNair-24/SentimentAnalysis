51) 13) text: Yeah...I do freelance for a lot of magazines. But print really is dead. So now most of my stuff winds up on websites. Which is depressing. `Cause you can't hold it -- you can just look at it. It's like... Charlie seems lost in drunken thought. Long, awkward sile Millie puts her hand on Charlie's arm.
51) 15) dialog: Huh? MILLIE
51) 18) text: (trying to save the situation) So, Crash -- why don't you tell this nice lady about the 21 days you were up in "The Show," and what the crowds were like, and -- CHARLIE
51) 19) text: It was crazy. I... Charlie drifts off for a moment. CHARLIE (CONT'D)
51) 20) text: (to Millie) I'm sorry -- I'm sure you're a great lady. You have lovely hands and hair but... Charlie begins to walk away, wobbly on his feet. CHARLIE (CONT'D)
51) 21) text: ...I'm gonna go to the...I'm just gonna go. Charlie stumbles off. MILLIE
51) 22) text: (as Charlie leaves) You want a ride...? Charlie exits the bar. MILLIE (CONT'D)
52) 0) text: Charlie rides his BICYCLE down the street. Swerving all o the place, he's obviously drunk. Red and Blue LIGHTS flash behind him. Charlie turns to se -- a POLICE OFFICER. 74   INT. KATE &amp; CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY Charlie leaves Kate a VOICEMAIL MESSAGE.
52) 1) dialog: (into phone; seems sort of nervous)

52) 8) text: Such an idiot... 75   EXT. KATE &amp; CHARLIE'S HOUSE - STREET/FRONT YARD Kate and Charlie stand by Kate's car, which is parked in front by the street. She's just arrived. Awkward tension.

52) 14) dialog: Really?
52) 17) text: Yeah. A couple of days ago. Tuesday. CHARLIE
52) 18) text: Oh...wow. Congratulations. That's really...really...just great. I mean it. (beat) Tuesday is the night I got pulled over. (laughs) Parallel lives, huh? Kate rolls her eyes. CHARLIE (CONT'D)
52) 20) text: (taken aback) Charlie...
52) 21) dialog: Are you? Silence.
52) 23) text: No. Charlie seems relieved. CHARLIE
52) 25) text: I don't think it's a good idea. Charlie nods. Long beat. CHARLIE
52) 26) text: I fucked up, didn't I? Kate looks down, doesn't speak. CHARLIE (CONT'D)
52) 28) text: Charlie, please don't do this. CHARLIE
52) 32) dialog: ...and all I want to do is touch you one more time to just, remember -- to make sure it was real. Silence. Kate looks Charlie in the eyes and gives him a slight smile.
52) 33) dialog: (changing course)
52) 34) text: Or...maybe I'm a just a delusional fucking idiot. 76   INT. KATE &amp; CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHE Kate and Charlie walk in -- it looks sort of the same, bu number of items are missing, and it's messier. In general the room looks more "dude."
52) 36) dialog: Yeah?
52) 38) dialog: I dunno -- like...I'm not sure. (seems slightly concerned                           * that he can't remember)
52) 41) dialog: Sure, yeah -- or I could make a bacon and egg sandwich...
52) 43) dialog: Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then meat. (beat)
52) 44) text: Have you given up fun, too? Kate looks at Charlie -- he's half-smiling, not sure if s finds him funny.
52) 46) dialog: (off Kate)
52) 49) dialog: Okay...
52) 51) dialog: Sorry. Charlie puts the beer back in the fridge.
52) 53) dialog: You sure?
52) 55) dialog: (thinks about it)
52) 59) dialog: Have you been playing a lot?
52) 61) dialog: Then how're you beating me?
52) 63) dialog: I haven't met anyone even vaguely interesting since we separated.
52) 65) dialog: I've been masturbating like crazy.
52) 67) dialog: I miss you.
52) 69) dialog: Okay. Fine. Beat.
52) 71) dialog: (confused) What?
52) 75) text: But is that really the point? CHARLIE
52) 77) text: (beat) I worry about you. CHARLIE
52) 78) text: (laughs) Yeah, I can understand that. I used to worry about you. But now I know you're okay. (beat) That makes me happy...I mean, it fucking sucks that you're better off without me but I'm glad you're doing well. No reply from Kate. CHARLIE (CONT'D)
52) 80) text: You should go for yourself, not to make me happy. CHARLIE
52) 82) text: I'm not moving back in. That wasn't the response Charlie wanted to hear. KATE (CONT'D)
52) 83) text: Listen, I should go. It's gonna get dark soon. CHARLIE
52) 88) dialog: Maybe...? Kate shakes her head. Charlie seems hurt -- but still determined. CHARLIE (CONT'D)
52) 89) text: Okay...fine. 0 for 2. (new direction) Last question: can we just...play one more game? Kate doesn't answer. CHARLIE (CONT'D)
52) 90) text: C'mon...you keep kicking my ass. It's embarrassing. You've gotta give me a chance to redeem myself. (soft) Please. Kate thinks about it for a long beat, and doesn't say yes ...but she also doesn't say no. There's a look of hope in Charlie's eyes.
