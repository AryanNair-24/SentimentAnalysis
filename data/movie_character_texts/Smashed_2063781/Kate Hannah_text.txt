I got fired from my job. And that shit happened SOBER! I never read that in any pamphlet... (shakes her head) ...that isn't what I signed up for. (beat) Um...so, I relapsed. Another shitty slogan I've heard in the rooms is that when you're sober for a bit and drink again "the disease waits for you, picks up where it left off." (beat) I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE those slogans. They all sound like bumper stickers. But, I have to admit...for me, that last one is pretty damn true. (beat) When I drink...I become another person. And that person is a pretty big asshole. Well, unless you want to give me drugs or buy me drinks -- then that person is awesome. People knowingly LAUGH.
