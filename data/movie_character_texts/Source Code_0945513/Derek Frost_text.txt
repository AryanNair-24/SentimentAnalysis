An OLD MAN with a faded wool suit clutches a cane. A BACKPACKER, female, European, 20s, hiking boots, examin guidebook. A dowdy OFFICER MANAGER type sorts supermarket coupons in tabbed file box. An African American EXECUTIVE reads a newspaper. None of them pays any attention to Colter. A WHOOSH of AIR -- he turns to An AIR-CONDITIONING VENT. The HISS of AIR sound sinister. Like the exhalations of a creature. A SCRAPE. He looks to see A woman FILING HER NAILS. Colter cringes. Every detail, every sensory impression se heightened, near the point of overload. He reaches Christina again. Eases back in the seat across from her. She writes in her journal, ignoring him.

66) 1) dialog: What the hell, man? What the hell???
66) 9) dialog: What is this? Get away from me! The BARREL of a 9 MM PISTOL. Aimed right at him.
66) 11) dialog: Jesus. Derek raises his hands. Sweating. All fright. Like a decent man, terrorized. It gives Colter pause. Does he have the right guy? A toilet FLUSHES. The last stall door opens and Guzman emerges. Stops cold as Colter swings the pistol at him.
66) 13) dialog: Don't hurt me.
66) 15) dialog: Keep my wallet. Take my watch. Take anything you want. Unprompted, Guzman takes out his own wallet and sets it o the counter. Calmer than Derek. Accustomed to trouble.

66) 80) dialog: Trust me, by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed...
66) 84) dialog: A slight flicker travels across Derek's face. Like a disturbance on a surface of deep water.
79) 8) dialog: Wow. Thanks. Keeping his composure, Derek accepts the wallet. Colter steps aside, allowing them to pass. Allowing it al to happen. The station slides into view. No one on the platform.
