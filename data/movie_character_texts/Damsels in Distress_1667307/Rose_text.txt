0) 1) dialog: Look.
0) 3) dialog: There.
1) 3) dialog: Well, attempted ones.
1) 18) dialog: No, all you need are friends of about the same size. A grungy pack of male students approaches, inconsideratel hogging the path, obliging the girls to step aside. Sudde Rose looks like she’s smelled something foul; Violet gags
1) 25) dialog: (very nasally) This wasn’t true nasal shock. Had it been, I’d’ve lost consciousness entirely.
1) 34) dialog: How could they lose it?
1) 45) dialog: Though it will be that.
1) 47) dialog: Though they don’t know that.
1) 53) dialog: Stunning. Lily puts the dress up to see how it looks in the mirror.
2) 2) dialog: Definitely.
2) 4) dialog: (forcefully) A loo-ser!
5) 5) dialog: --Education--
6) 2) dialog: Still, I hate it when they puke. Violet thinks about this.
6) 4) dialog: But are they learning? It’s like a puking festival.
6) 16) dialog: Professor Papadapoulos?
7) 0) text: They approach another Georgian brick building. Rose and Heather carry a large box of donuts and “jug 0’ joe.”
8) 0) text: While Heather and Rose set up the coffee and donuts for t center, including the sign explaining their restricted us
8) 5) dialog: Are you dating anyone?
8) 26) dialog: Can we help you?
8) 28) dialog: Please sit down.
8) 43) dialog: Ouf.
8) 49) dialog: Vomit.
8) 51) dialog: Pot, cheap deodorant -- there might be a vermin infestation. Heather and Lily place the coffee and donut next to him.
8) 56) dialog: That's a terrible expression -- “fine.” (a funny voice) “I'm fine.” (normal voice) Anyone who says they’re fine definitely isn’t. It’s kind of conceited. Something smug about it.
8) 59) dialog: Why are you here then? Are you a con man, a confidence trickster?
8) 64) dialog: Yes of course the campus cops.
9) 3) dialog: Confidence tricksters!
9) 5) dialog: This man could still be a trickster.
10) 4) dialog: (in terrible shape) Could I wait outside?
14) 14) dialog: Two quarts.
14) 31) dialog: You’re joking-- 19 27.
16) 2) dialog: Well, the coffee’s good.
18) 31) dialog: That’s a playboy or oper-a-tor move. Oper-a-tors like that are to be avoided.
18) 33) dialog: Sending drinks to two gorgeous girls? His intention was to seduce -- and he assumed he could.
18) 36) dialog: I doubt that was the course he was seeking.
18) 40) dialog: Nonsense.
18) 42) dialog: Rubbish.
18) 45) dialog: What you’ve described is a playboy or oper-a-tor move.
20) 0) text: The lights are low. Some cool music is on. The camera swoops up the stairs, passes through a doorway and enters club “nest” area -- finding Priss and Frank in passionate embrace. Their kiss goes on and on. Reverse angle: Violet, Rose, Heather and Lily at the doorway, shocked. Violet turns and flees, the others foll
21) 2) dialog: What a jerk.
21) 5) dialog: What a rat.
21) 7) dialog: Don’t waste a single tear on that creep.
21) 11) dialog: What?
21) 18) dialog: Frank's stupid, we knew. That he was a rat jerk playboy op-er-a-tor I hadn’t realized.
21) 29) dialog: Priss is a rat. A bitch. A rat- bitch.
24) 15) dialog: Are you sure he was mean?
24) 17) dialog: This Charlie Walker sounds like an oper-a-tor, a “playboy” type.
24) 19) dialog: I thought he was a slick businessman.
24) 21) dialog: What?
24) 23) dialog: What he is is a “strategic oper-a- tor.” Lily notices Violet, turned to the wall.
25) 3) dialog: Polly! Have you seen Violet?
25) 5) dialog: I’m not sure. 35 36 37 48. Outside, Lily and Rose look for Violet, calling, and ente wood.
26) 0) text: Violet walks back from the wood; Lily and Rose find her.
27) 1) dialog: I don’t understand, what were you doing? There is no response -- just the sound of water.
30) 1) dialog: Polly, have you seen Violet?
31) 2) dialog: How did she seem when you last saw her?
31) 7) dialog: From what I’ve observed in my admittedly brief span on earth, people generally don’t jump for joy after being dumped by the moronic jerk in whom they’ve invested all their hopes and dreams.
31) 9) dialog: People aren’t exactly as you assume. The Violet you know bears little resemblance to the girl I met Seventh Grade year--
31) 11) dialog: Well, her name wasn’t “Violet” then. A “wavy” memory dissolve begins as Rose thinks back...
32) 9) dialog: Yes -- not an easy name to have at that age.
32) 11) dialog: Timid, bookish... classic scholarship student -- her parents were writers. They didn’t have a dime. Finances were the least of her worries.
32) 13) dialog: Well, she was crazy -- I got stuck rooming with her on the class trip when no one else would. Ouf, it was awful.
32) 15) dialog: No. Obsessive cleanliness was part of her insanity.
32) 17) dialog: No, not really -- the idea of being nice to weird and unpopular kids hadn't arrived then.
32) 19) dialog: She was very strange -- constantly setting herself odd, repetitive tasks--
32) 21) dialog: For example on that trip she had with her a little square suitcase. The idea came into her head she had to move it in a precise pattern, over and over again... Images of young “Emily” attempting this as a young “Rose” watches, expression agape.
32) 22) dialog: If she didn’t execute this exact movement, flawlessly, ten times -- she'd start over from scratch. Looks from the others.
32) 23) dialog: Another was to slide her hand across her forehead, trying not to touch her hair or her eyebrows on either side -- (Rose demonstrates) -- also repeating it ten times. Any niggling thought she touched a hair on either side, she’d start over.
32) 26) dialog: Well, it was a compulsion. 44n 45 46 47 54.
32) 28) dialog: She had the superstitious conviction that if she didn’t complete these tasks flawlessly -- her parents would die.
32) 30) dialog: No. But what made the whole thing really sad was that her parents did die.
37) 9) dialog: The Motel 6?
37) 11) dialog: The Motel 4 in Villafranca - oh my God, you really were suicidal!
41) 12) dialog: What do you think -- she was jealous because Lily’s absolutely lovely.
41) 14) dialog: Of course! You wouldn’t break up a happy couple. Violet is studying a piece of paper she’s taken from the
41) 19) dialog: Frank can write by hand? What is it? 62.
41) 28) dialog: No. Dyslexics are intelligent. Violet handles a little leather-covered ball from the box
41) 34) dialog: That’s all Frank gave you, a bean- ball? 58 63.
41) 36) dialog: They aren't?
46) 14) dialog: We're not “guys,” fortunately...
46) 17) dialog: What do you mean?
46) 19) dialog: That’s outrageous!... We’re perfectly nice people. We’ve met a lot of pathetic guys and nothing very bad’s happened.
49) 4) dialog: A kind of moron jamboree.
49) 6) dialog: A moron jamboree.
49) 16) dialog: “Stra-tegic Devel-op-ment?” What is that? 71.
49) 19) dialog: Something bus-i-ness related?
49) 23) dialog: I suppose that’s how they keep from having profits -- by paying lots of money to companies like yours.
49) 34) dialog: He never got his coffee. The girls consider this significant detail.
53) 1) dialog: Packenstacker?
53) 17) dialog: It's true. With the study habits prevailing at Seven Oaks, your body might not be found until spring.
53) 20) dialog: Don’t suggest. Insist. 73 77.
59) 0) text: Close on: feet during a line dance, lots of boots and hea footwear -- just a couple pairs of light “Repetto” slippe amidst all the clomping. A wider view -- Violet, Rose, Heather, Jimbo, Fred amidst more “Western” dancers: Jimbo keen on a reserved Rose, Violet with Fred. Across the roo Lily enters looking sad. From the sidelines she watches t dancers. After a bit, the others notice her, Violet wavin for her to join them. Lily shakes her head and dodges the looks. Finally, Violet breaks away from the line.
60) 2) dialog: You don’t understand what?
60) 25) dialog: You know, some people like that.
68) 2) dialog: This is what comes from not teaching Latin in the schools!
69) 2) dialog: No. They look back as a roar rises from the D.U. crowd.
70) 1) dialog: The art and thought of the classical age were the glory of civilization. These are nothing but moronic fraternity high jinx -- not improving or uplifting in the least. There are some smash-ups as the race descends into a spectacle of drunkenness and hopeless chaos.
71) 0) text: Suddenly Rose looks faint and gasps, placing her hand ove her face.
71) 1) dialog: Oh no -- what’s that... stench?! Rose gags as if about to wretch. From the girls’ right co another roar; they turn to see:
73) 6) dialog: Maybe that’s good. They watch more melee as the scene fades, the fighting so and wails of wounded Romans continuing over BLACK.
75) 6) dialog: Oh really? I seriously doubt that.
75) 8) dialog: Okay, you're probably right.
75) 12) dialog: The genetic link between morality and large posteriors? Yes, I think that’s well known.
76) 0) text: Rose walks with Violet who’s obviously quite upset and overwrought.
76) 2) dialog: Better not next to Robertson.
76) 4) dialog: Didn't you hear? Suicidal Ed School students have been going up to the roof and throwing themselves off.
76) 6) dialog: Yes, I know, it’s terrible -- not high enough to kill but high enough to maim, and particularly dangerous for anyone below. They head down the central path -- a safe distance away.
76) 8) dialog: But you really liked him. 93.
76) 11) dialog: I have to say, I was wrong about Fred. I thought he was a playboy or oper-a-tor type. In fact, he’s just another guy rendered helpless by the attentions of a pretty girl. They are interrupted by a commotion, shouts, from nearby Robertson Hall and a young woman following a young man ac its roof.
76) 15) dialog: Isn’t the Ed School essentially a teachers’ college?
76) 17) dialog: What concerns me is, if they can’t even destroy themselves, how are they going to teach America’s Youth?
76) 21) dialog: In fact it’s impossible for me to imagine.
76) 23) dialog: What kind of retard is he?
76) 27) dialog: What’s the full story?
76) 29) dialog: (suddenly alarmed) What’s this all about?
77) 0) text: Violet, Rose, Heather and other volunteers pack bars of t “wonder” soap in oval cardboard packets. Behind them displaced DU members, sleeping bags lying around, lounge, play with bean balls, etc. 98.
79) 2) dialog: I don’t think there’s any rush.
79) 7) dialog: I doubt that, to be perfectly, absolutely honest.
81) 3) dialog: Are you coming Friday? Violet is launching her dance craze at the Lone Star. Fred's impressed.
81) 5) dialog: The “Sambola” -- the Devil’s Dance.
82) 0) text: Violet and Rose beginning their evening ablutions.
82) 1) dialog: I’m beginning to learn things about myself. I’m actually a really poor judge of character--
82) 3) dialog: No, I am. A terrible excess of opinion distorts my judgement. I was completely wrong about him, he’s not a playboy or oper-a-tor type at all. He’s a loser.
82) 5) dialog: Have you forgotten him? 109 108. Violet, eyes watering, shakes her head “no.”
82) 6) dialog: I don’t think you should give up on him. Rose spits the toothpaste into the sink.
82) 7) dialog: One thought reassures me: Our stupidity must be part of God’s Divine Plan. He must have made us stupid for a reason.
82) 9) dialog: Yes. Probably.
83) 0) text: Violet, sharply dressed, completes a music check with the Manager GUS near the dance area, then goes to Rose at the where cocktails have just been served. Violet gives a worried look around the sparsely populated bar.
83) 2) dialog: Most guys aren’t very good at the dance craze thing anyway.
87) 0) text: The three approach the Lone Star, just as Rose, Heather, Violet and Jimbo come out looking downcast.
89) 4) dialog: So from your earliest years you were already a playboy or oper-a- tor type.
94) 0) text: Rose and Violet, thoughtful, study together on benches.
94) 2) dialog: No, you're mistaken.
94) 4) dialog: Six.
94) 6) dialog: I don’t know what you’re referring to. 118.
94) 8) dialog: I’m from London. I was there, and now I’m here. I’m “from” London.
94) 10) dialog: Nice. (caricatures a nasal American accent) “Nice. Nice. Fine. ‘Fine.’” (reverts to type) Those are not adjectives I like to use. God gave us abilities -- he requires that we use them: “Good. Better. Best.” “Excelsior! Higher!” Only excellence can glorify the Lord. Vulgarity is, in essence, blasphemous.
98) 3) dialog: Looks to me like just another... Devil Dance. I’m waiting for a dance of truth, and beauty, and righteousness. A dance that glorifies, not the body, but the Lord.
