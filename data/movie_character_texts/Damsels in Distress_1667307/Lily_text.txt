1) 28) dialog: What do you mean?
1) 32) dialog: I’ve got to get to the housing department -- it seems they lost my rooming assignment.
1) 36) dialog: No, there were more acceptances than they anticipated and not enough rooms to go around. Violet exchanges quick looks with Rose and Heather.
1) 38) dialog: Really?
1) 41) dialog: What dynamic are you talking about?
1) 43) dialog: Of what?
1) 49) dialog: But aren’t they the same age as we are?
1) 52) dialog: Omigosh it’s beautiful.
2) 3) dialog: What’s a “sad-sack?”
2) 5) dialog: (to Violet) You like losers?
2) 11) dialog: You mean, someone you can really help? Not just thinking of yourself?
3) 1) text: Frank, this is Lily, she’s just come to Seven Oaks as a transfer student. Isn’t she great?
5) 2) dialog: That was really fun.
5) 7) dialog: Really?
6) 8) dialog: What?
6) 10) dialog: The guys you know, are they all Greeks?
6) 12) dialog: Are all the guys you know Greeks?
6) 14) dialog: (more slowly) Are. All. The. Guys. You. Know. Greeks? Violet looks to the others.
6) 17) dialog: “Greeks” -- frat boys. Blank looks all around.
6) 19) dialog: Like last night. A pause.
6) 22) dialog: How?
7) 1) dialog: What house is this?
7) 3) dialog: Those are cliches, aren’t they?
8) 2) dialog: Really?
8) 6) dialog: I don’t see the connection.
8) 10) dialog: No... Well, there’s this grad student whom I met over the summer - - Xavier [pronounce Zav-ee-yay]. We became pretty good pals.
8) 12) dialog: Well, he has a girlfriend whom I met -- she’s very nice. Violet looks around to the others.
8) 14) dialog: Of what?
8) 16) dialog: What do you mean?

8) 20) dialog: It’s an “xX.” 14.
12) 14) dialog: Could I join you guys?
12) 16) dialog: Uh, no.
12) 18) dialog: Have we suffered?
13) 1) dialog: Why do you think he’s such a jerk?
13) 3) dialog: I mean what’s he done that’s so jerky?
13) 5) dialog: But, Violet, don’t you think...
13) 7) dialog: Well, don’t you think that the way you talk be considered arrogant too? They walk in silence for a moment.
13) 8) dialog: I mean, a little...
13) 10) dialog: Well...wouldn’t that be hypocritical, criticizing Rick DeWolfe for something you could be criticized for yourself? Violet considers this with complete equanimity.
13) 12) dialog: I’m sorry, I know your intentions are good--
13) 14) dialog: Yes, but not exactly a humble one.
13) 16) dialog: I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to--
14) 3) dialog: What? Violet just shakes her head but Rick looks and sees Viole contemptuous stare. A Ceausescu moment. Then he recovers.
14) 25) dialog: I thought you handled it well.
14) 29) dialog: I’m sorry--
15) 4) dialog: (whispering) Is it really such a good idea to call him “freak”?
15) 6) dialog: He’s already depressed; constantly calling him “freak”--
15) 22) dialog: I’ve become friends with this really nice group...
15) 25) dialog: Yeah.
15) 27) dialog: What do you mean?
15) 30) dialog: What?
15) 32) dialog: Oh, yeah, sure. Lily follows their movements as they prepare the meal. Xavier lifts a lid revealing three artichokes in a cloud steam.
15) 33) dialog: What's that?!
15) 35) dialog: Those.
15) 37) dialog: Is that what they look like?
15) 40) dialog: They look so weird! Like little Martian space vehicles. Xavier laughs.
16) 3) dialog: If someone were really determined to destroy themselves, I don’t think they’d stop for coffee. 31.
16) 5) dialog: Where are we going?
16) 7) dialog: Why?
16) 9) dialog: How would that be helpful? They’re morons.
16) 11) dialog: No, they are. They’re morons.
16) 15) dialog: Bye.
16) 17) dialog: Over to Xavier's.
16) 19) dialog: Why wouldn’t it be?

17) 5) dialog: Oh, she is?
17) 7) dialog: I thought Alice would be back.
18) 2) dialog: She’s actually quite a good person. I mean, her entire identity revolves around helping people.
18) 4) dialog: Well, she thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is completely egotistical.
18) 7) dialog: Hey! 34.
18) 13) dialog: She thinks the editor, Rick DeWolfe, is conceited and, in fact, quite mean.
18) 15) dialog: Yes, he wants to close Seven Oaks’ Roman-letter clubs.
18) 17) dialog: No.
18) 19) dialog: The point that Violet makes is that they can’t be elitist, they’re morons.
18) 21) dialog: But you’ll grant that they’re morons and that’s a handicap -- such people should be helped, not hounded and persecuted. 24 35.
18) 23) dialog: Yes. Losing the roof over your head, being thrown out into the street, that’s about the worst thing that can happen to anyone. Xavier shrugs, cruelly indifferent.
18) 24) dialog: Violet thinks that there could be some risk of... suicide.
18) 26) dialog: It’s a factor to be taken into consideration.

21) 9) dialog: Jerk.
21) 13) dialog: Come on, Violet, Frank’s a moron. You're well rid of him.
21) 15) dialog: What, Frank’s not a moron?
21) 17) dialog: Well, there’s a mutable barrier then.
21) 20) dialog: Well, I’d stop.
21) 25) dialog: No! He’s worthless!

22) 5) dialog: Well, it’s a title, but the book’s not lame at all.
22) 7) dialog: Okay, the title’s not good, but the book is.
22) 11) dialog: Yes, and whether it will continue to do so...
23) 2) dialog: Just to find the nearest package store you had to drive forty miles. (sips) These aren’t so strong--
23) 4) dialog: I think I'd like another.
23) 6) dialog: Why not?
23) 8) dialog: Are you trying to stifle me?
23) 11) dialog: Oh, hi! 31 45.
23) 13) dialog: I’m with Charlie.
23) 15) dialog: Why?
23) 17) dialog: But why?
24) 0) text: Lily walks slightly ahead and separate from Xavier and Al silent and angry. She might be a little tipsy.
24) 5) dialog: That was so rude. He’s a nice guy and you embarrassed him.
24) 7) dialog: No, he wasn’t.
24) 9) dialog: I was plying myself with martinis--
24) 11) dialog: You don’t know anything about him--
24) 14) dialog: I just had no idea Xavier could be so mean. While the chat centers on Lily, the camera also observes Violet’s post-jilt pain.
24) 18) dialog: He’s not like that at all, he’s actually a really nice guy. 33 34 47.
24) 20) dialog: No, he dresses well but he works in strategic development.
24) 22) dialog: “Strategic Development” -- he works at “S.D.A.” -- Strategic Development Associates. He’s an associate there.

31) 4) dialog: still? Heather nods.
31) 6) dialog: I’m beginning to wonder about Violet. How can someone so smart continue mooning over a dope like that.
31) 8) dialog: But Violet’s so great, how could she go berserk over an idiot like that?
31) 10) dialog: You met Violet in Seventh Grade?
32) 8) dialog: “Tweeter?” Like a bird?
32) 10) dialog: Not at any age. What was she like?
32) 12) dialog: What do you mean?

32) 24) dialog: My God that’s insane!
32) 27) dialog: What compelled her?
32) 31) dialog: Omigod.

41) 26) dialog: But he wrote “gif.”
41) 33) dialog: How thoughtful.
41) 37) dialog: Gosh, Violet, you’ve really got to stop thinking about Frank.

41) 42) dialog: What?
41) 44) dialog: I’ve never been anywhere.
41) 46) dialog: Uh... No, I don’t think so. He shows her a postcard of Carcassonne.
41) 47) dialog: It's fascinating, I'd like to visit it.
41) 50) dialog: Really? Why?
41) 52) dialog: Omigod, the Catholic Church is, like, always bad. Xavier nods.
41) 54) dialog: So, you’re a Cathar? 59 60 65.

49) 33) dialog: That’s not possible -- he’s got a full-time job at Strategic Development Associates.
49) 35) dialog: Why would he lie about something like that?
53) 2) dialog: Omigod, how crazy. He’s completely insane -- and I almost dated him.
53) 5) dialog: Making up an entirely fictitious identity? That’s not crazy? It’s insane, psycho, weird...
53) 8) dialog: This is different. It’s pathetic... All that about “strategic development” he just made up -- don’t tell me that’s not weird.
53) 10) dialog: Omigod, Violet you’re not going to start going out with him? (watching her face) You’re not, are you?
53) 12) dialog: Not to the stacks, I hope. Violet nods.

From the sidelines she watches t dancers. After a bit, the others notice her, Violet wavin for her to join them. Lily shakes her head and dodges the looks. Finally, Violet breaks away from the line.
59) 2) dialog: It’s okay.
60) 7) dialog: No, I don’t mind.
60) 10) dialog: Because Cathars don’t believe in procreative sex, they don’t have intercourse the usual way.
60) 13) dialog: No, it’s okay. Yes, the normal way, from the front -- where you can have procreation -- not from the other side... where you can’t. A light goes on in Jimbo’s head.
60) 15) dialog: Not exactly but that’s the direction their beliefs head in -- when they want to express love, that’s what they do.

The girls loo to each other, appalled. Two guys jump for the same disc, bashing into each other, one dropping like a stone as if dead.
81) 1) dialog: I guess it wasn’t realistic to expect Doar Dorm to turn into “Dior Dorm” overnight. 107.
81) 7) dialog: Yes, I’d like to but I have several papers to finish. But I’d like to...

84) 8) dialog: No, it’s later on, like 10 I think... I have to confess I’ve started losing patience with Violet. Depression calls for serious treatment -- medication, psycho-pharmaceuticals, talk therapy-- 110.
84) 10) dialog: A little off-beat! Omigod. I don’t know how much you know about Violet but there’s some pretty weird stuff. “Violet,” “Violet Wister” is not even her real name.
84) 12) dialog: No. It’s “Emily Tweeter.” Apparently when she was eleven years old she went completely crazy and has had several relapses since, so it’s a little worrisome to have her counsel nearly suicidal individuals-
84) 14) dialog: What?
84) 16) dialog: You remember that?
84) 18) dialog: What?
84) 20) dialog: Could, uh--

Any mass of people, such as you might find in a large university or high school, divides into many different 116 117 118 119 116. groups. Normally there’s a “cool crowd,” and then variously less cool crowds. When I first met you and Rose, I thought you were the “cool crowd” -- and, in many ways, you are. I find your perfume and fashion sense excellent.
89) 17) dialog: But...there’s a reason, I think, why you are so strongly attracted to doufi. And it’s not an accident. How different groups divide up... While Lily speaks Violet notices something.
95) 0) text: Lily and Violet come down a path, both in frilly “Damsels costumes.
95) 1) dialog: I’m sorry what I was saying before - - of course you’re not irretrievably linked to the doufi or even that such distinctions are valid--
95) 3) dialog: Oh, so you think cool people have less humanity?
95) 5) dialog: In our society there’s all this propaganda in favor of uniqueness, eccentricity, etc, but does the world really want or need more of such traits? Aren’t such people usually terrible pains in the neck? What the world needs to work properly is a large mass of normal people -- I'd like to be one of those -- sorry.
95) 7) dialog: Yeah. Of course.
