0) 2) dialog: Where?
0) 4) dialog: Yes. I think so. Violet approaches the lithe, pretty but sad-looking LILY. VIOLET (CONT’D) Hello. Are you a new student?
0) 6) dialog: Good -- we thought so. We’d like to help you.
1) 1) dialog: As a freshman, it can be very tough. You finally get to college, it’s supposed to be so great but, generally -- it’s not. University life can be pretty bad.
1) 7) dialog: So you were unhappy at your old school and are looking to recover here? Well, I think you will! Violet encourages her with a huge smile. A pause.
1) 9) dialog: Would you welcome that? Would our help and guidance be something you’d appreciate, or would you rather sink or swim on your own? Either way’s fine, we’d still be friends.
1) 12) dialog: Great! Well, let’s start immediately. She gives Lily a very quick looking over. VIOLET (CONT’D) Clothes can be critical for confidence -- and an overall sense of well-being.
1) 14) dialog: It’s not about liking or not liking...
1) 16) dialog: How you look when you put them on.
1) 19) dialog: Phew! Rose bends over, hyperventilating -- it’s a bit scary.
1) 21) dialog: You didn’t notice that?!
1) 23) dialog: Those guys! That smell! That awful acrid odor. Rose’s hyperventilating gets a little less. [Film full speech in both locations: ] VIOLET (CONT’D) Rose has a very sensitive nose.... INT. GIRLS’ ROOM -- DAY 3 Rose lies in her bunk, a handkerchief to her nose.
1) 24) dialog: ..--Have you heard of “nasal shock syndrome?” Any harsh, acrid, or just “disgusting” odor sends Rose into nasal shock--
1) 29) dialog: Seven Oaks is notorious for it’s b.o. It was the last of the “Select Seven” to go co-ed. (looks around, combative) An atmosphere of male barbarism predominates -- but we’re going to change all that!
1) 31) dialog: Where’re you going?
1) 33) dialog: That's terrible. You've no place to stay? Lily shakes her head, her eyes watering a little. VIOLET (CONT’D) They lost your housing assignment?
1) 37) dialog: Why don’t you stay with us?
1) 40) dialog: You mustn’t think of this in the old fashioned sense of going to a party to “find someone” or “not find someone.” That’s not the dynamic we’re talking about.
1) 42) dialog: I’m glad you asked that. Our going to a party of this kind is more a form of... “youth outreach”--
1) 44) dialog: “Youth outreach.” It’s not just some moronic frat house social function--
1) 46) dialog: Yes, of course, but what we’ve got to keep in mind is -- these guys are very young, they’re “young people”-- Violet opens the door and goes halfway out, with one part comment. VIOLET (CONT’D) They're essentially immature, crying out for help and guidance. She leaves.
1) 50) text: Only numerically. Violet returns, carrying a beautiful dress.
1) 51) dialog: I’m a lot fatter than you are but I think we could pin it.
2) 1) dialog: Take Frank, my friend -- he’s not some cool, handsome, “studly” macho- type. No, not at all -- I can’t stand guys like that! He’s more of a sad-sack really, wouldn’t you say? Rose and Heather nod.
2) 6) dialog: Very much so. Do you know what’s the major problem in contemporary social life?
2) 8) dialog: The tendency, very widespread, to always seek someone “cooler” than yourself -- it’s always a stretch, often a big stretch. Why not find someone who’s frankly inferior?
2) 10) dialog: Yes. It’s more rewarding and in fact quite reassuring.
2) 12) dialog: Yes! That’s it. Precisely! But without the goody-goody implications -- our aspirations are pretty basic: Take a guy who hasn’t realized his full potential, or doesn’t even have much and then help him realize it -- or find more. There’s enough material here for a lifetime of social work. Looking ahead, they see the front verandah of the D U whe drunken frat member walks toward its balustrade and dramatically falls, front-flipping, over it and disappear from view. He then stands and walks calmly back into the club. ON the girls: Lily’s shocked expression, the others’ equanimity: VIOLET (CONT’D) What’s really worrisome is that that-- (she makes a face) -- was intentional. The girls pass through the frame toward the clubhouse.
3) 0) text: Entering it’s instantly clear the girls greatly outclass D.U. guys, a “meatloaf crowd” that includes Violet’s FRAN
3) 3) dialog: Lily failed or was unhappy at her last school but we're sure is going to adapt beautifully here. In fact she already has!!
3) 5) dialog: Omigod -- a “golden oldie.” I love these! Violet starts the dancing; they all join in.
4) 0) text: The four pair off and dance enthusiastically with klutzy partners -- Violet with Frank, etc. Later women arrivals on jealously. Violet tries out new, cool dance steps -- t others follow suit. The dancing gets better. Even the DU guys -- most sad-sacks but one, THOR, dumb and handsome - rise to the occasion.
5) 0) text: Breaking from the dancing Violet leads them into the refreshment area.
5) 1) dialog: Omigosh! Wasn’t that great?
5) 4) dialog: I know that people can have useful careers in many areas: Government. Law. Finance. --
5) 8) dialog: Yes. Something that could improve the lives of every person -- and every couple. Frank looks at Violet with pride, which Violet rewards wi quick kiss before sampling the punch. VIOLET (CONT’D) My gosh that’s good! What’s in it? The young bartender gets flustered with an “uh...” “duh.. reaction -- he doesn’t know. VIOLET (CONT’D) No, don’t tell. It’s better a mystery!
6) 1) dialog: I’m so proud of what you accomplished last night. You showed those guys a really good time without anything really bad happening. You could see their confidence and enjoyment increase by the minute, while not letting them turn into animals. That's good.
6) 3) dialog: That’s okay. It’s part of growing up -- “they're learning their limits.” 10.
6) 5) dialog: Well, their aim’s improving! They're getting more directional!
6) 7) dialog: Dar-fur.
6) 9) dialog: Dar-fur. There are horrible injustices in the world and we shouldn’t obsess over the adolescent misdemeanors of friends.
6) 11) dialog: What?
6) 13) dialog: Excuse me? I don’t understand.
6) 15) dialog: I don’t think we know any Greeks.
6) 18) dialog: Oh! Oh Yes! Fraternities! You mean members of Greek-letter 10 11. fraternities -- American college slang: “Greeks.”
6) 20) dialog: Actually last night we were at the “D” “U" house: “D", “U,” Roman letters, not Greek. Seven Oaks doesn’t have a Greek letter fraternity system -- it’s always been a Roman letter system here.
6) 23) dialog: Well, I think you'll see.
7) 2) dialog: Oh, this isn’t a fraternity -- at least not one anyone should want to join! The sign reads: “Suicide Center.” Violet picks up the “Prevention” from the Center’s sign f the floor. VIOLET (CONT’D) (to Lily) You probably think we’re frivolous, empty-headed, perfume-obsessed college coeds. You’re probably right. I often feel empty headed-- Violet puts the “Prevention” sign back up. VIOLET (CONT’D) But we’re also trying to make a difference in people’s lives. And one way to do that is to stop them from killing themselves. 11 12. Violet and Lily climb the Center steps. VIOLET (CONT’D) Have you ever heard the expression, “Prevention is nine-tenths the cure?” Well, in the case of suicide, it’s actually ten-tenths the cure.
8) 1) dialog: {Yes, they are.] It’s interesting that you say that. I love cliches and hackneyed expressions of every kind. Do you know why? Lily shakes her head “no.” VIOLET (CONT’D) Because they’re largely true: The hundreds, perhaps thousands of such cliches and hackneyed expressions our language has bequeathed to us are, in fact, a treasure-trove of human insight and understanding.
8) 3) dialog: Yes. Oh, come sit with us. During these formative college years we should try to learn as many hackneyed thoughts and expressions as possible -- furthermore, I think we will!
8) 8) dialog: Boyfriends are a primary suicide risk.
8) 11) dialog: “Good pals?” What’s that?
8) 13) dialog: What’s the point of that?
8) 15) dialog: Xavier with the girlfriend.
8) 22) dialog: Okay, let’s see if we can figure this out. Used at the beginning of a name, “Z" and “X"” have the same pronunciation.
8) 24) dialog: Actually there were two “Zorros.” One spelt his name with a “Z" and made a “Z" mark for Zorro, the other one spelled him name with an “X" and with his sword he’d make an “X" mark. What was really unfair was that, because he marked his name with an “X”, everybody assumed he was illiterate, when actually he was spelling correctly. A frantic seeming young male student bursts into the Cent they all stop what they’re doing.
8) 25) dialog: Hello.
8) 27) dialog: Of course we can! No case is too hard or challenging -- would you like a donut? Heather springs into action.
8) 31) dialog: What’s your name? 15.
8) 33) dialog: Why?
8) 35) dialog: Why do your friends call you “Jimbo?”
8) 37) dialog: Yah. I got that. But, why bother.
8) 39) dialog: Why bother: “Jim” is already a lovely name -- short, simple, evocative -- shouldn’t a nickname simplify the name that it’s replacing? Jimbo’ doesn’t simplify anything.
8) 41) dialog: Well, maybe you should ask your friends what they had in mind. (reading from form) Where do you live or reside?
8) 46) dialog: The smell. It’s notorious. 16.
8) 48) dialog: You're right, it’s more like a “stink.” Unclean clothing, I'd say, mostly.
8) 52) dialog: No wonder you’re depressed, living there. Did you know that a good smelling environment is crucial to our well-being? Have you thought of moving and finding a place that smells better?--
8) 54) dialog: Are you sure? Because you kind of seem on edge.
8) 57) dialog: Why do you say you're “fine?”
8) 61) dialog: Omigod! Why didn’t you say so! Violet jumps up.
8) 62) dialog: We have to go! (to the others) Call the cops -- a suicide might be in progress! Violet heads off.
9) 0) text: They head quickly along the walk. Violet still holds the partially eaten donut carefully and sanitarily with a thi tissue.
9) 1) dialog: Take this. I’m sorry-- Violet gives Jimbo his donut back.
9) 2) dialog: It’s just that we get a lot of students coming to the center pretending to be depressed to get the donuts.
9) 4) dialog: Yes, it’s really bad, really cynical. And we made a pledge the donut company that we would only give the donuts to students who were depressed, suicidal or 13 18. otherwise nutty. We’re a non-profit -- so the rules are pretty strict. Jimbo nods as he jogs, his mouth full.
9) 6) dialog: We'll soon find out... I’m surprised we haven’t had more cases from Doar Dorm -- living in such squalor must be terribly destabilizing psychologically.
9) 8) dialog: You poor guy!... Tell me about this girl.
9) 10) dialog: Oh, yeah-- (to the other girls) --it’s very hard for beautiful women to experience rejection.
10) 0) text: They are outside the girl’s room. Violet tests the door handle. It’s locked. She shakes it.
10) 1) dialog: Priss? Priss? Are you okay? They listen but can hear nothing.
10) 2) dialog: Priss! Say something! Meanwhile each reacts to the Doar Dorm odor: most gasping Rose spraying perfume on her pashmina and trying to breat through that.
10) 3) dialog: Priss! Open up -- please! Priss! She listens but there’s no sound from within. Rose approaches Violet, looking unwell. 19.
10) 5) dialog: Yes! It’s best to get as far away as possible! Rose, who looks shaken, nods.
10) 6) dialog: Take care of yourself, Rose.
10) 8) dialog: Priss say something! Please!-- Campus cops arrive. VIOLET (CONT’D) Oh thank God, we're going to have to force this door.
11) 0) text: The campus cops burst into the room -- followed by Violet the others. PRISS bolts up from her dorm cot, where she’d been lying teary-eyed, head under a pillow, headphones in ears. She’s delicate-looking and very pretty.
11) 1) dialog: Priss?! Are you okay?! Priss takes the headphones out of her ears.
11) 3) dialog: Please don’t-- Please, please-- Come with us.
12) 0) text: Violet & Jimbo sit with Priss who nurses a hot chocolate.
12) 1) dialog: But you had contemplated suicide?
12) 3) dialog: Had you resolved to kill yourself?
12) 5) dialog: Could you excuse us? Jimbo nods and goes. Violet turns back to Priss. VIOLET (CONT’D) Do you want to talk about it? What was his name?
12) 7) dialog: If you'd rather not talk about it, we don’t have to -- Priss nods, but the tears don’t stop.
12) 9) dialog: No, I’ve never actually seen that.
12) 11) dialog: He had blue eyes? Priss nods.
12) 12) dialog: So does Frank -- Frank’s the guy that I go out with. Otherwise he’s not conventionally good-looking -- which I actually prefer. Would you describe “Josh” as handsome? 21. Priss nods, too overwhelmed to talk further.
12) 13) dialog: That’s a problem. Lily comes by with a cup of tea.
12) 15) dialog: Yes, please. Priss and I were just talking -- in my view, handsome men are to be avoided. I don’t even consider good looks to be flattering in a man. Do you know what I mean?
12) 17) dialog: Cookie-cutter “good-looking guys” with their “chiseled features,” running around, full of themselves, getting everything they want, never suffering or experiencing any--
12) 19) dialog: We're not under discussion-- That's irrelevant, beside the point. (to Priss) Is this making you feel any better? Priss has stopped crying.
12) 21) dialog: Good! I hoped it would. (checks her phone) Okay, it’s nearly four and the Daily Complainer’s orientation meeting is about to start. I think we should go. The editor, Rick DeWolfe, he’s terrible, a real jerk.
13) 2) dialog: Environment? Genetics?
13) 4) dialog: Oh. You’ll see. He’s one of those I was talking about -- tall, probably considering himself very smart and handsome -- and a “journalist” -- so you can just imagine the mind-boggling arrogance and conceit.
13) 6) dialog: What?
13) 9) dialog: Yes, of course, but what’s your point?
13) 11) dialog: No, I don’t see why... We’re all flawed. Must that render us mute to the flaws of others? Must we tether ourselves from comment because our natures are human too? (very happy) We've got a rebel amongst us! That's good, I think. It’s good to be challenged and criticized. 23.
13) 13) dialog: You’ve put your finger on something important. That’s it, precisely: Our intentions are good. We’re seeking to help people rescue their lives from terrible sadness and failure -- which is a worthy goal, don’t you think?
13) 15) dialog: No, I agree with you there, you're right absolutely. I’d like to thank you for this chastisement.
13) 17) dialog: No, I think you did and I think it’s good. It’s good to have a friend to put one in one’s place when that’s what one needs and now I see that I have that kind of friend in you. I think that’s great!
14) 2) dialog: Oh brother!
14) 9) dialog: Oh what nonsense!
14) 13) dialog: Have you met any of their members? The guys from the DU, for example? They're morons, barely competent for the tasks of everyday life. They have to drink something like a quart of beer just to talk toa woman-—
14) 15) dialog: Yet you salivate at the idea of taking the roof off these poor guys’ heads, and throwing them brutally into the street where who knows what harm might come to them. And you consider yourself a Christian?
14) 17) dialog: What unkindness and cruelty -- and yet you’re proud of that. This is the darkness in human nature, in the very Heart of Man -- which the British novelist Joseph Conrad wrote about most eloquently.
14) 19) dialog: Omigod! Pedantic too! Unkind, self-righteous and pedantic -- in short, a model journalist! Rick looks around and appeals to the crowd.
14) 21) dialog: Tap is a highly effective therapy as well as a dazzlingly expressive dance form that has been sadly neglected for too many years.
14) 23) dialog: No, we don’t -- we're using the whole range of musical dance numbers which over many years have proven themselves to be effective therapies for the suicidal and hopelessly depressed. 18 INT. GIRLS’ ROOM -- NIGHT 18 Violet lies on her bunk, looking discouraged, while the others relax or go about their business.
14) 24) dialog: That really got me down.
14) 26) dialog: You did? Thanks. No, it’s all this aggression and hostility that gets me down -- not just his, but also my own. It leaves you feeling unclean.
14) 28) dialog: You’re probably right but there's something else... What Lily was saying about me being conceited and arrogant-——
14) 30) dialog: No, I think you’re right. It’s bad. I feel terrible.
14) 32) dialog: No, I’m serious. It’s terrible how I’ve acted. I’m embarrassed.... We’re all Christians -- Or, I should say “Judeo-Christians:” humility should be our watchword, the essence of being a good person. The question is, how do you become humble if you’re essentially arrogant and... evil by nature? The room falls into silence.
15) 1) dialog: Very good, Freak!
15) 3) dialog: Yes! Certainly. Lily takes Violet aside.
15) 5) dialog: What?
15) 7) dialog: (whispers back) That’s his name, “Freak” -- “Freak Astaire,” that’s how he wants to be called. “FREAK ASTAIRE” -- the gangly student -- notices them talking.
15) 9) dialog: Lily was just saying that she likes your dancing. Freak nods. Next to them DEBBIE, a chorus member, seems catatonic. VIOLET (CONT’D) Are you okay?
15) 11) dialog: I just noticed that you looked a little sad and I was wondering if there’s anything we could do.
15) 13) dialog: No, I’m worried you’1l kill yourself and make yourself look bad.
15) 15) dialog: No.
15) 17) dialog: Excuse me, what scent are you wearing? 20 29.
15) 19) dialog: The perfume that you’re wearing.
15) 21) dialog: You see, that could be the problem. INT XAVIER’S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- EVENING 20 The kitchen in the ground floor apartment in a private ho Lily’s grad student friend XAVIER and his girlfriend ALIC the midst of preparing a healthy-looking meal.
16) 1) dialog: You know, I’m not convinced that having a “Suicide Prevention Center” prevents any suicides.
16) 6) dialog: I thought I’d take Priss over to the D.U.
16) 8) dialog: Well, it might be helpful for her to meet some of the guys.
16) 10) dialog: Come on, Lily.
16) 12) dialog: No. Not medically... I like them. They're in that sympathetic range of being not good-looking, and yet not smart. There’s something likeable about that. Spending time with them, you get the sense that you’re really making a difference in their lives. For somebody suicidal, like Priss, that could be a real boost.
16) 14) dialog: Oh. That's good. It's better not to have the identity as a suicidal person, don’t you think? Lily heads down a divergent path.
16) 16) dialog: (worried) Where’re you going? 22 32.
16) 18) dialog: Is that a good idea?
16) 20) dialog: Is his girlfriend going to be there?
16) 22) dialog: No -- no nose. Just a general foreboding.
16) 24) dialog: You know, you’re absolutely right! I was being nosy, terribly so. I’ve got to watch that. Please forgive me. I want to become a better person. Can one? Can one change one’s nature? I don’t know. But I feel we must try.
18) 32) dialog: Why? It seems very generous to me - - sending a round of drinks over to 36. people he didn’t know? Drinks are expensive.
18) 35) dialog: Isn't that a bit harsh? He was probably just yearning for some intelligent discourse.
18) 37) dialog: Was he alone?
18) 39) dialog: You see -- he was alone and probably lonely. He could see that Alice and Lily are college students. College students are well known for their intelligent conversation. After all they can always talk about their courses. That was probably what attracted him--
18) 41) dialog: Perhaps his view was even loftier -- to court Lily, with a view to Matrimony. We’re in the North but occasionally a Southern gentleman can wander into these parts.
18) 43) dialog: Why not? Seeing Lily across a crowded bar, filled with the usual undergraduate slobs, why wouldn’t a thoughtful young man seek her out? She’s lovely. Isn’t it incumbent on men and women to find ways to meet each other? Buying drinks for 37. a person you don’t know seems to me to be a particularly generous one.
18) 46) dialog: I’‘ll grant you it’s a tactic, or perhaps even a ruse. But without some of that, would our species even survive? The Lord said, “Be fruitful and multiply--”
18) 48) dialog: No, this is how the world works -- “seeing someone across a room” -- this could be a great romantic story to tell your grandchildren. Violet imagines this.
18) 49) dialog: And if you do marry and have children then he'll learn how to really squander cash. Isn’t it good to know he’s basically generous from the start.

21) 14) dialog: Don’t say that.
21) 16) dialog: You know, Lily, you’re a bit harsh. This obsession with “intelligence” — - do you think it has some magical quality, transforming everything? The intelligence line is not an... immutable barrier; love can cross it. You can love someone whose 42. mental capacity is not large... I know; I have.

35) 17) dialog: Yes. It does. But I’m not as crazy as I was up to yesterday. Partly that’s due to the salutary effect of scent on the human psyche. It’s importance is, I believe, almost incalculable. At the motel this morning I happened to use this bar of soap-- Violet shows the soap in a see-through plastic zip-lock b VIOLET (CONT’D) It was provided me as a courtesy as one of its guests -- that an economical motel would provide such good soap is quite unusual. The scent is very precise.

41) 35) dialog: Relationships aren’t about presents.
41) 38) dialog: Why? I don’t want to stop thinking about him. Recently I had a thought that cheered me up a lot: ...-Life is like a long flowing river and, as a long flowing river, some debris you never expect to see again is almost certain to reappear, floating to the surface... Frank and I may very well be together again one day. Maybe it’1ll take many years but somewhere, down the line, he is very likely to pop up again -- and I‘ll be there to catch him. INT. XAVIER’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 58 Great music plays; lots of candles providing flickering illumination. The camera snoops down the hallway to the kitchen, where there are a few dishes left from a dinner deux, to the living room where Lily and Xavier smooch on couch, their clothes undone. Xavier slightly disentangles himself, enough to talk.
46) 2) dialog: Might your drinks-buying friend be here? It would be great to get some complimentary cocktails.
46) 10) dialog: “So?” “So” is probably the unkindest word in the English language. I can’t bear it. It should be outlawed: “So.”

49) 5) dialog: I wish I could say the Roman Holidays were a celebration of the best in classical learning, 70. education, architecture, philosophy -- with poems in the style of Juvenal and recreations of historic events such as Cato’s defense at the bridge. But, alas, it’s --
49) 7) dialog: The only Roman elements will be worship of Bacchus, Beerus and Blotto and it’s such a shame because it could all have been so uplifting and improving. Charlie Walker, not wearing a suit, enters the cafe. Lily spots him.

52) 1) dialog: Well, you were lying.
52) 3) dialog: Why were you making it up?
52) 5) dialog: Eighth year, impressive. But your whole life was a lie -- dressing up in suits, buying people drinks?
52) 7) dialog: So it was a playboy or oper-a-tor move?
52) 9) dialog: I admire that -- drinks are expensive. But “Strategic Development” -- that was made up too?
52) 11) dialog: What cousin Jay?
52) 13) dialog: Oh. I don’t have any cousin in Philadelphia. 75.
52) 15) dialog: I was just saying that to be friendly -- to make a kind of link... So your name’s Fred something?
52) 17) dialog: What’s your name?
53) 0) text: Violet with the others, studying but also talking.
53) 4) dialog: I don’t think he’s crazy.

54) 10) dialog: What do you mean?
54) 12) dialog: Are you gay?
54) 14) dialog: I think you might be romanticizing the past.

73) 1) dialog: I suppose this is what happens when decadence rots society from within--
73) 4) dialog: And not the interesting decadence of former times but the moronic kind you get today. She nods toward the on-going melee.
73) 5) dialog: Such a society is, I fear, destined to fail and be overrun. Rose, hands over her nose, winces from the barbarian smel

75) 3) dialog: Guys have their preferences.
75) 5) dialog: There’s nothing to be done. Fred must know his own mind.
75) 7) dialog: Come on, Lily’s got that slender, delicately swelling, blossoming beauty no man can resist.
75) 9) dialog: Poor Lily. Think of all Xavier put her through. A pause for thought.
75) 10) dialog: He just used her body -- and not even the right side.
75) 14) dialog: Yes? Violet goes to the door, glancing through the peephole be opening it. 90.
75) 15) dialog: Oh, hi. Frank strolls in.
75) 18) dialog: I’m sorry -- it’s terrible. This year’s Roman Holidays did seem like the end of civilization -- but even when civilization ends, people are going to need a place to stay.
75) 20) dialog: Okay, sure -- that sounds like a good stopgap measure.
75) 22) dialog: Yes.
75) 24) dialog: Yes. Violet goes to find it, Frank following. As she opens the box, he notices the note in his handwriting. 91.

75) 28) dialog: Oh. One gets so few things written by hand anymore, I guess I kept it...
75) 33) dialog: You must have meant “jiff.” “Back in a jiff” and then misspelled it, or spelled it in a non-standard way.
75) 40) dialog: I think there might be something between her and Thor.
76) 0) text: Rose walks with Violet who’s obviously quite upset and overwrought.
76) 1) dialog: I can’t bear this tension with Lily. It’s terrible to have the group divided this way. Rose looks up and guides Violet away from the path alongs Robertson Hall.
76) 3) dialog: What?
76) 5) dialog: But, it’s only two stories--
76) 7) dialog: I’ve got to forget about Fred.
76) 9) dialog: This whole thing of a person meeting someone else first: it’s so arbitrary, it’s terrible and cruel - She looks to Rose for support but only gets a blank look.
76) 10) dialog: -- especially when that selection by “priority” is the opposite of how things ought to be.
76) 16) dialog: Yeah.
76) 25) dialog: Well, it’s somewhat understandable.
76) 32) dialog: (whispers) I think Rose’s sleeping. A silence, except for the sound of Rose’s breathing.
76) 34) dialog: No, not at all. When you’ve problems yourself, it’s great to hear someone else’s truly idiotic ones. Please go on. A shocked pause.
76) 36) dialog: What?
76) 38) dialog: I’m sorry -- you're right. Please go on.
76) 40) dialog: I’m sorry. You know how I am. Please continue. On Heather’s face as she struggles with her resentment.

76) 44) dialog: Yah, we call them “green” but they’re actually more bluish.
76) 46) dialog: No, they can be blue. I know it sounds strange but--
76) 48) dialog: You know, actually, that’s true: navy uniforms are black.
76) 50) dialog: No, by mistake the Navy received a huge shipment of fabric that was black, not blue. So as not to waste it they decided to sew gold braid on and use it -- and found that everyone assumed it was blue, navy blue, when it was in fact black.
76) 52) dialog: Yes -- I believe so. In the dark Heather gets out of bed and starts looking ar for her clothes and dressing.
76) 53) dialog: What’s wrong?

77) 2) dialog: These guys are not really “homeless” -- they lost their fraternity house. It’d be better to call them “house-less.”
77) 4) dialog: Hey, could you guys help?! Frank and another approach. (Thor, in the background, cli back in his sleeping bag, depressed and dejected.)
77) 6) dialog: We need help packing this soap which we’ll then distribute to Doar Dorm residents.
77) 8) dialog: What would you say are the most effective means to fight depression? Frank is completely stumped. His D.U. brothers listen in, making faces.
77) 9) dialog: Maybe some of your D.U. brothers have an idea. The D.U. guys think.
77) 12) dialog: It's interesting what you say. My Cousin Jay’s a medical officer in
77) 15) dialog: No. Ultimately it leaves you much worse off than before.
77) 17) dialog: By “boot,” do you mean “vomit?”
77) 19) dialog: No, none of the effective anti- suicide treatments involve vomiting. D.U. guy thinks.
77) 22) dialog: Exactly. It’s very important. That's why we have such hope in the wonder bar. Do you know its scent? They shake their heads. Violet cups in the palms of her hands and offers it up to them. They inhale deeply -- and are (somewhat) transported.
77) 25) dialog: Transformative, we think.
77) 27) dialog: Yes. Violet, looking around, notices Thor lying prostrate in h sleeping bag, his head buried in his arms.

77) 33) dialog: Going to the bathroom.
77) 35) dialog: I’m sorry, did I disturb you?
77) 37) dialog: Yes, I think that’s clear. Quite a few others stick their heads out.
77) 41) dialog: No, we’ll do the routine... Rose! Violet hurries back toward the room, no longer trying to soften her clacks:
77) 42) dialog: Madge wants to see the routine!
77) 46) dialog: Just briefly, please, it’s helpful to have an audience-- Rose, the music.
77) 51) dialog: I would say: Richard Straus, Roderick Charleston and... Chubbert Checker.
77) 53) dialog: Yes -- that was one of his posts.
77) 55) dialog: Yes. Violet swivels slightly to include the other students, speaking slowly for their benefit.
77) 56) dialog: Each one of these men started an international dance craze -- “Rickard” Straus, the Waltz; Roderick Charleston, the Charleston, and Chubbert Checker, better known as “Chubby”, the dance we know as the Twist. 103 103.
77) 58) dialog: (surprised) Dance crazes enhance and elevate the human experience, bringing together millions of people ina joyous celebration of our God-given faculties and passing these delightful modes of physical expression down through the generations -- though not so much any more. A pause.
77) 60) dialog: No... Though that misconception is quite widely held. It was Roderick Charleston. Usually behind some great creative phenomenon is a person, not a town.
78) 0) text: Freak and Violet practice a song and dance version of “Th are Looking Up,” the chorus dancing behind:
78) 1) dialog: (singing) Oh things are looking up, Since love looked up at me! Priss pops into the room and stands by observing. Debbie, the chorus, notices Priss and stops, as do others.

79) 5) dialog: No, the highest fatality rate -- it’s not certain what percentage were intentional and how many just due to a temporary unawareness of gravity’s laws.
79) 8) dialog: No, I love the idea -- Dior Dorm. I adore optimism, even when completely absurd, perhaps especially then.
80) 2) dialog: Let’s not let our hopes up get too high, Heather.
80) 5) dialog: Doar Dorm.

83) 0) text: Violet, sharply dressed, completes a music check with the Manager GUS near the dance area, then goes to Rose at the where cocktails have just been served. Violet gives a worried look around the sparsely populated bar.
83) 1) dialog: It’s great! Thanks, Gus. (to Rose) I don’t see how we’re going to start a dance craze if no guys show up.
83) 3) dialog: Yeah, but still... Heather enters, out of breath, dressed for the dance but otherwise preoccupied.

87) 0) text: The three approach the Lone Star, just as Rose, Heather, Violet and Jimbo come out looking downcast.

88) 6) dialog: In Oregon? Why?
89) 8) dialog: Doufi.
89) 10) dialog: You can say either: “doufi” respects the Latin root and so is preferred. “Doufuses” is also correct, although a bit inelegant.
89) 12) dialog: Yes. I’ve had to.

94) 1) dialog: I miss my nice American friend.
94) 3) dialog: Oh come on, you go to London for four weeks--
94) 5) dialog: It’s very dangerous, parents letting their children travel. They see them off at the airport and don’t know what they’1ll be getting back. Rose reflects on this.
94) 7) dialog: You’re not from London.
94) 9) dialog: I just miss my nice American friend.
95) 0) text: Lily and Violet come down a path, both in frilly “Damsels costumes.
95) 2) dialog: No, don’t apologize -- I probably do have a “doufi” orientation. But behind “coolness” isn’t there a certain repressing, squashing down or at lack of cultivation of one’s humanity?
95) 4) dialog: No, of course not, I don’t think cool people are entirely inhuman -- just enough to be cool. 121 119.
95) 6) dialog: But you will still do the part?
96) 0) text: In the long dance mirror first Lily then Violet appear, i their extravagant costumes for the musical.

96) 4) dialog: But did performing those two numbers help you overcome adolescent feelings of discouragement and despair?
96) 6) dialog: (calls) Freak! Freak responds to her signal, pressing “play” on the ster boombox. The song starts -- Fred begins the quiet lyric:

97) 1) dialog: Things are looking up I've been looking the landscape over And it's covered with 4 leaf clover Oh things are looking up Since love looked up at me! Bitter was my cup But no more will I be the mourner For I've certainly turned the corner Oh things are looking up Since love looked up at me Others from the cast move in behind them, with some pairi off -- Lily with Xavier, Thor with Heather, Frank and Fre with Rose, Jimbo with Priss:
