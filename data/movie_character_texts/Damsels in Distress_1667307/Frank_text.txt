19) 15) dialog: I’m not homo-phobic, but I’m not going to go looking in mirrors, checking to see what color my eyes are!... I don’t think my eyes have a color.

75) 21) dialog: Thank you, thank you.... There was, uh, one more thing -- you remember that bean ball we talked about?
75) 23) dialog: Do you think I could pick that up? After everything that's happened, I could really use it right now.
