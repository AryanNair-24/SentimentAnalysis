15) 23) dialog: Reall? Yeah -- though they’re somewhat perfume-obsessed.
15) 24) dialog: Oh them -- those girls? The ones who volunteer at the Suicide Center?
15) 26) dialog: But they’re terrible! The blonde one -- she’s notorious.
15) 28) dialog: Such a bitch, terrible, isn’t she?
15) 34) dialog: What?
15) 36) dialog: Artichokes?
17) 1) dialog: Lily! Xavier stops.
17) 2) dialog: You were coming over? 23 Lily, surprised, nods. Xavier gets off his bike.
17) 4) dialog: Alice is working.
17) 6) dialog: But it’s not a problem -- it’s good you came. Let’s go to the Oak Bar; I‘1l buy you a beer. Lily hesitates.
17) 8) dialog: I’‘1l call her. She’ll join us there. Lily hesitates further.
18) 3) dialog: You really think that’s true? For instance, what's she have against the Complainer? That’s bizarre.
18) 5) dialog: And your friend isn’t?
18) 9) dialog: Hi! Great! You got the message.
18) 11) dialog: Lily’s roommate. She sounds unbearable. She’s on a rampage against the Complainer.
18) 18) dialog: Come on. There’s no possible justification for those places. They're exclusive and elitist.
18) 20) dialog: Yeah -- elitist morons. Confounded for a second, Lily regroups.
18) 22) dialog: (with a laugh) Persecuted?
18) 25) dialog: Oh, because some moronic frat boy might kill himself, Seven Oaks can’t do what’s right?
18) 28) dialog: No it isn’t. You can’t set policy that way. The barman arrives with a new round of drinks.
18) 29) dialog: Excuse me, we didn’t order these--
23) 10) dialog: Lily?
23) 12) dialog: Listen, we’re going to get something to eat, why don’t you come with us?
23) 14) dialog: I can see that. But you really should come.
23) 16) dialog: I just think it would be a good idea.
23) 18) dialog: You really must come. I insist.
24) 0) text: Lily walks slightly ahead and separate from Xavier and Al silent and angry. She might be a little tipsy.
24) 1) dialog: Lily? She just keeps walking.
24) 2) dialog: Lily, are you angry? Lily passes the front of a restaurant.
24) 3) dialog: Lily! This is it. We’re here. She returns, as if reluctantly.
24) 4) dialog: What’s the matter?
24) 6) dialog: He’s not nice at all. He was trying to get you drunk. 32 46.
24) 8) dialog: Plying you with martinis? What a sleaze-ball.
24) 10) dialog: Come on, the guy’s a total sleaze, a creep.
24) 12) dialog: The way he sent drinks over to our table? Alice, fed up, turns and walks quickly away. Xavier chase her.
24) 13) dialog: Alice! Alice! What’s wrong?! INT. GIRLS’ ROOM -- DAY 32 Tight on Violet’s face, as she lies on her bed, her face lightly angled toward the wall.
39) 2) dialog: Hello!
39) 4) dialog: Sorry, I just went out to get some things. He puts another bag of groceries on the counter.
39) 6) dialog: Gone.
39) 8) dialog: Left. We broke up.
39) 10) dialog: I know, I’m sorry. I thought it better to tell you in person.
40) 0) text: LATER, CUT TO CLOSE ON: Vegetables saute in a pan. Xavier cooks, Lily helps.
40) 1) dialog: Alice couldn't control her jealousy -- it completely overwhelmed her.
40) 3) dialog: Oh come on.
40) 5) dialog: You. After a while I just couldn't handle it -- things became impossible.
40) 7) dialog: Of course.
41) 0) text: The coffee table has been set with two places and low candles. Lily brings in their plates as Xavier looks thro some dvds.
41) 1) dialog: Would it be okay if we watch a film?
41) 3) dialog: I thought, maybe, Truffaut's “Baisers Voles”, “Stolen Kisses.” Do you know it?
41) 5) dialog: It’s a classic of French New Wave cinema -- I think you'll like it. Xavier puts the dvd on and reaches for the wine.
41) 7) dialog: Yeah. Xavier pours them two glasses of wine -- Lily watches. TIGHT ON: red wine pouring into a glass.
41) 8) dialog: You don’t know Truffaut?
41) 10) dialog: Do you know Godard? “A Bout Souffle?” EXT./INT. LIVING ROOM, XAVIER’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 56 Travelling pan of room as closing music of Truffaut film plays. Slouched back on the sofa, Xavier and Lily kiss. INT. GIRLS’ ROOM -- DAY 57 Heather paces, Lily and Rose study, Violet examining the contents of a small case.
41) 39) dialog: There’s something I wanna... He stops.
41) 41) dialog: I don’t think we’ve spoken about this--
41) 43) dialog: It's nothing bad. Have you ever been to the South of France -- for 64. example, to the walled city of Carcassonne.
41) 45) dialog: But you’ve seen pictures of it?
41) 48) dialog: So you never studied the Cathars? Lily shakes her head.
41) 49) dialog: They were a religious movement, very idealistic, located mostly in the south of France, that the Catholic Church and the royal authorities cruelly repressed. The “crusades” were not directed solely against the Moslems, there was also one against the Cathars.
41) 51) dialog: Cathar beliefs and way of life threatened the Catholic Church and the political authorities of that time. Catharism was branded a heresy and brutally repressed.
41) 53) dialog: Ideas can’t be killed as easily as people -- especially such enlightened ones as the Cathars held. In recent years more and more people have returned to their beliefs.
41) 55) dialog: Yes. I aspire to be. I’m trying to follow the path the Cathars marked out.
41) 57) dialog: I think you’d be surprised.
43) 0) text: Xavier goes between the bedroom and living room lighting candles and rearranging things, placing a lotion near the bed, adjusting the music. Lily, coming out, walks into Xavier’s arms. Xavier leads her to the bed where they continue kissing, finally coming up for air.
43) 1) dialog: Cathars dissent radically from Catholic teaching regarding procreative sex--
43) 3) dialog: In the Cathar view the highest form of love-making avoids procreation entirely. Lily laughs, a little embarrassed:
43) 5) dialog: Well, according to Cathar ideas, sex with condoms is just a parody of the procreative act. A pause.
43) 7) dialog: The standard, cliche, form of sexual intercourse is for the man to... approach the woman... from “the front.” In Cathar love-making -- which, I think you'll find very fulfilling -- it’s from the other side.
43) 9) dialog: Yes. Xavier kisses her tenderly and continues in a near whispe
43) 10) dialog: I‘ll be very careful, we’ll go slowly. It’ll be a new experience for you but one which I think you'll find brings an inexpressible closeness... They continue kissing.
47) 0) text: Lily approaches the house. INT. XAVIER’S HOUSE -- EVENING Xavier comes to the door and walks with her inside.
47) 1) dialog: Where were you? Gosh -- it’s late.
47) 3) dialog: With whom?
47) 5) dialog: You could have called.
47) 7) dialog: It’s not like you. At all. I got takeout. I suppose I’d better heat it up. He grabs her and they kiss.
47) 8) dialog: I’m sorry. I was just feeling so... Well, you know. He smiles. He picks up a bag and slips out a small amber cannister. 66 68 69.
47) 9) dialog: I got this -- it’s supposed to be great. He hands Lily the elegant bottle.
47) 11) dialog: A great lotion -- everyone swears by it. Would you prefer dinner first? Lily nods.
47) 12) dialog: I haven't been hurting you, have I? Lily shakes her head.
56) 9) dialog: The “A.L.A.” -- oh my God.
56) 11) dialog: You’re kidding. Lily, small voice, intimidated:
56) 13) dialog: “The A.L.A.?” “The Anal Love Association?” What do we have to do with that? Lily looks down at the brochure again. 77 78 80.
56) 14) dialog: You haven’t understood any of what we've talked about?
56) 16) dialog: The A.L.A. has nothing to do with us. Can’t you see that? Xavier sighs heavily and walks away, then returns.
56) 17) dialog: The way we express love has meaning, it’s in the context of something beautiful. We're following our Creator’s teaching, aspiring to an ideal -- a beautiful one that brings an inexpressible closeness, not just to each other, but to-- He grabs the brochure.
56) 18) dialog: For the A.L.A. and those like them, the love-act is just hedonistic pleasure-seeking, of a perverted nature -- there are words for people like that...! I can’t believe you'd think we had anything in common with them. We don’t, nothing, not an iota. Lily stares back at him.
57) 0) text: Lily is out the door and heading down the walkway, Xavier comes out after her.
57) 1) dialog: Lily! Lily! Come back! Please, don’t be that way!

85) 0) text: Shortly after, Xavier is with them in the booth.
85) 1) dialog: +..It was so brutal how it ended between us. I know I was too angry and a bit, crazy but I thought what we had was stronger than that. That you would not just walk away after one disagreement. With all we had been through, couldn’t you have just forgiven me... Lily says nothing for a few moments.
85) 3) dialog: Oh, you mean, my Cathar beliefs? Lily nods. Xavier is a little emotional.
85) 4) dialog: Well, I am no longer a Cathar.
85) 6) dialog: It's been very difficult.
85) 8) dialog: Yes. I have. 112 113 113.
85) 10) dialog: What?
85) 12) dialog: Having sabbath on Tuesday always seemed very bizarre to me. It is not right.
86) 0) text: Fred, Lily and Xavier hurry down the sidewalk -- semi- Jogging.
