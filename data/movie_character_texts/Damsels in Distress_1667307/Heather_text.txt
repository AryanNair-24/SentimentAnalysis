21) 24) dialog: Get him back.
21) 27) dialog: Sure you would.
21) 31) dialog: I wonder if people with blue eyes are in fact less kind than other people. Blue eyes could represent an icy nature.

37) 1) dialog: Violet! Violet! Heather runs toward her. HEATHER (CONT’D) You're back! You’re okay!
37) 3) dialog: Omigosh, Violet -- we were so worried, why didn’t you tell us or at least leave a note?
37) 7) dialog: But where did you go?
37) 12) dialog: But why’d you go?
37) 16) dialog: What? Violet looks in her bag and pulls out something which she holds cupped in her hands.
41) 11) dialog: Why was Alice so jealous? Lily just looks thoughtful, continuing studying.
41) 15) dialog: What’s that?
41) 17) dialog: Really? Recently?
41) 22) dialog: “Out for brewskis -- back in a... gif.”

53) 6) dialog: Violet's identity is made up. I don’t think she’s crazy.
53) 9) dialog: I’m sure I’ve heard of “Strategic development” -- I think it’s something pretty important.
59) 0) text: Close on: feet during a line dance, lots of boots and hea footwear -- just a couple pairs of light “Repetto” slippe amidst all the clomping. A wider view -- Violet, Rose, Heather, Jimbo, Fred amidst more “Western” dancers: Jimbo keen on a reserved Rose, Violet with Fred. Across the roo Lily enters looking sad. From the sidelines she watches t dancers. After a bit, the others notice her, Violet wavin for her to join them. Lily shakes her head and dodges the looks. Finally, Violet breaks away from the line.
60) 23) dialog: What?
65) 0) text: Thor, holding a brewski, approaches Heather.
65) 2) dialog: Hey.
65) 4) dialog: Hey.
65) 6) dialog: (with a flirting lilt) Hey.
73) 2) dialog: And from with out.
75) 11) dialog: Have you ever noticed that good and moral people tend to have large posteriors. Not everyone, by any means -- and I know it's not logical -- but it does seem to me true.
75) 13) dialog: You and Violet have that build -- it’s nice, you’re still very attractive -- but are also sensible and moralistic. I don’t. I have narrow hips, but also no very strong principles. There’s a knock on the door.
75) 16) dialog: Hi, Frank.
75) 31) dialog: That’s what I thought.
75) 36) dialog: Bye. Violet steps out in the hall with Frank who corners her.
76) 20) dialog: I’m really worried about Thor... It’s hard for us to imagine how upsetting it is not knowing what the colors are.
76) 22) dialog: When Thor sees a rainbow -- it’s only so much gibberish to him. There was one this afternoon: omigosh he took it hard. Recently there was a parade in the city where the marchers carried rainbow- colored flags and banners --- Thor was so upset: he said he’d no idea what it meant --
76) 24) dialog: See, that’s the conclusion people immediately jump to.
76) 26) dialog: Not if you knew the full story.
76) 28) dialog: You know how parents love bragging about how precocious their children are? Thor’s parents had become precocity-addicts: constantly needing an ever-greater precocity “fix.” When he should have entered kindergarten, they instead pushed him into First Grade. “Oh, Thor skipped a grade,” they could tell their friends, most of whom were terrible precocity-addicts too. 95.
76) 30) dialog: What Thor’s parents failed to consider was the enormously important academic work done in nursery school -- key being the study of colors, which in Thor’s case were -- a complete blank. Can you imagine?... I don’t want to be too critical of Thor’s parents. I suppose they just assumed that colors are the sort of knowledge people pick up along the way -- like, for example not stepping on sidewalk cracks. There’s an odd sound.
76) 31) dialog: What's that?
76) 33) dialog: Am I boring?
76) 35) dialog: Wow.
76) 37) dialog: When you said that about depressed people being mean, you weren’t joking.
76) 39) dialog: No. 96.
76) 41) dialog: Thor decided he absolutely had to learn all the colors, both primary and mixed. He’s been hitting the books really hard and thought he had finally mastered them. Then in town today he said “that traffic light’s blue.” I had to say, no, it’s green. He was really upset. He'd been so sure it was blue.
76) 43) dialog: This was a green light --“cross at the green, not in-between.”
76) 45) dialog: “Bluish” but still green.
76) 47) dialog: Huhn. I don’t know about that. Frankly, it’s hard to believe. Anyway, we continued walking and a naval officer passed us. Thor blurted out, a bit aggressively, “his uniform’s black.” I had to correct him. Navy uniforms are blue, “navy blue” -- that’s why they're called that way. Omigosh, he was upset! It was as if he were going to cry. Rose awakes, a little alarmed.
76) 49) dialog: They're navy blue. That’s the color’s name. 97.
76) 51) dialog: Still? Navy uniforms are still black?
76) 54) dialog: I’ve got to tell Thor! There’s no telling what he might do! The door opens and someone enters from outside. HEATHER (CONT’D) Who’s that?
77) 0) text: Violet, Rose, Heather and other volunteers pack bars of t “wonder” soap in oval cardboard packets. Behind them displaced DU members, sleeping bags lying around, lounge, play with bean balls, etc. 98.
77) 1) dialog: It's getting to look like a homeless shelter in here.
77) 3) dialog: Okay. It’s getting to look like a house-less shelter then. Violet turns to some of the D.U. refugees.
77) 26) dialog: This is so exciting. -- it’s really great, isn’t it. 100 100. On Rose’s skeptical visage as she listens: HEATHER (CONT’D) I can just see those guys opening the packages, taking out the soap, smelling it and then excitedly going to wash themselves. For them finally to be clean, free from that horrible acrid smell, how different the world might look to them.
77) 30) dialog: I better go to him. Heather heads toward where Thor is.
79) 0) text: Tight on Lily eating, widen on the whole group having breakfast. Violet seems somewhat sad, Heather a bit high. 105.
79) 1) dialog: This is so exciting -- when should we go over there?
79) 3) dialog: No, I'd like to go as soon as possible. Doar Dorm has the university’s highest fatality rate, as well as the worst hygiene. This could really change things.
79) 6) dialog: I can just see those guys getting the little gold packages, opening them and finding the terrifically good-smelling soap inside. Despite their habitual reticence toward hygiene, the wonderful scent and cute packaging should prove irresistible. And, once clean, they’1l start to see the world with new eyes. The change could be dramatic. Doar Dorm could soon become -- “Dior Dorm.”
79) 9) dialog: Great! Ready? Let’s go.
80) 0) text: The girls walk in the direction of Doar Dorm, Heather slightly ahead. 106 106.
80) 1) dialog: Let’s hurry. She starts to jog -- Violet catches up to her.
80) 3) dialog: No, you said yourself -- the Wonder Bar is transformative. Fred, walking the other way, spots them.
80) 7) dialog: Oh, no.
81) 0) text: The group walks back from Doar Dorm, Heather upset.
81) 2) dialog: They wouldn’t even open them: they said without the soap, the discs wouldn’t fly properly. Rose turns to Fred.
83) 4) dialog: Very good news! I was just at my procrastination seminar and the two guys from Doar Dorm -- had showered. It was pretty clear they’d used soap -- Omigosh, what a 109. difference! It seems they’d been throwing the packages so energetically a soap bar fell out -- the unfamiliar, ivory-like object intrigued them. One thing led to another and -- well, it was just as you said. Isn’t that great? Violet and Rose nod. Violet takes a few steps, looking around.
87) 0) text: The three approach the Lone Star, just as Rose, Heather, Violet and Jimbo come out looking downcast.
88) 2) dialog: Who?
88) 4) dialog: Oh yeah. What a knucklehead. The important thing to remember is that he was mythical -- he never really existed.
89) 18) dialog: Thor! No!
90) 0) text: They turn in time to see Thor run into the street followe Heather. The sun is out and its rays, bouncing off the da clouds still hanging in the sky, create an exquisite ligh effect. Everyone follows them into the street. In the distance a rainbow has formed -- this is what panicked Heather. Thor runs hell for leather toward the beautiful arc, Heather after him.
90) 1) dialog: Thor! No! Stop! Please, stop! TIGHT ON: Thor’s face as he runs, torn with emotion.
92) 0) text: Thor runs up the stairs, Heather behind.
93) 0) text: Thor runs toward the balustrade, Heather comes up from th stairs, almost too winded to call:
