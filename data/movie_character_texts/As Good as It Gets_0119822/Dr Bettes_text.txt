55) 6) text: Tell me how bad it is. I let him  go out last night when it was so  cool without an overshirt -- just  and underone with just the straps  and I know better...  and I let him  talk me into it. He was whining  and...  you don't need this. Give  me a second to catch hold. And so she does. Wow does she... and gives us some  notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it  takes to subdue it as Dr. Bettes keeps reassuring her and she keeps nodding... finally a deep breath as Spencer  enters from the bathroom. All at hyper speed now.  Salvation as farce.

55) 47) dialog: Water...  Nobody told you it might  be a good idea to remove the  carpeting and drapes in Spencer's  room?
55) 49) dialog: You don't have to do it this  second...  it's not dangerous or  anything. It's just something  that's advisable. Look, there's  a lot to be checked but...  Hey,  your son is going to feel a  good deal better at the very  least...  She pats his head...  Then embraces him with fierce  intimacy.
55) 52) dialog: They're considerable. But Mr.  Udall wants to be billed. She takes this as a blow to the heart, stomach and groin.
