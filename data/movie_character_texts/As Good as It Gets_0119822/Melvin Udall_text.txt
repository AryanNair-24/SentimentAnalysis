1) 3) dialog: Come here, sweetheart... come on.
1) 5) dialog: Wanna go for a ride? Okay,  sweetie? The dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog  urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG  sensing a kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK.
1) 6) dialog: (a malevolent tone)
1) 7) text: You've pissed your last floor, you  dog-eared monkey. The dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much  meaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout  shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the  garbage chute.
1) 9) dialog: I'll bet you wish you were some  sort of real dog now, huh? Don't  worry...  this is New York. If you  can make it here, you can make it  anywhere, you know? You ugly,  smelly fuck. And with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and  lets go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING "ANOOOOS"  from the DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment  door opens emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON  NYE, early 30s. Simon has been born and raised with  Gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of  trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man.
2) 0) text: Frantic... he bolts into the hall... Melvin is just about to enter his apartment.
2) 4) text: Have you seen Verdell? MELVIN
2) 5) text: What's he look like? Melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is directly opposite Simon's. SIMON
2) 6) text: My dog... you know... I mean my  little dog with the adorable  face... Don't you know what my dog  looks like? MELVIN
2) 8) text: Which color was that? MELVIN
2) 10) text: Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall. MELVIN (not missing a beat)
2) 15) dialog: (to Simon)
2) 20) dialog: Hope you find him. I love that  dog. Simon, terminally non-confrontational, still finds  himself compelled to turn back toward Melvin.
2) 22) text: You don't love anything, Mr.  Udall. Simon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the  hallway.
2) 23) dialog: I love throwing your dog down the  garbage chute.
3) 0) text: Melvin locks and unlocks and locks his door, counting to  five with each lock. He turns the lights quickly on and  off and on five times and makes a straight-line towards  his bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens  the medicine chest.
6) 0) text: Quiet -- safe -- just Melvin's voice reading aloud as he  writes.
6) 1) dialog: 'Somewhat in the dark, she had  confessed and he had forgiven.  This is what you live for, he  said. Two heads on a pillow where  there is only the safety of being  with each other. How, she  wondered, could she find such hope  in the most shameful part of her.' He barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads.
6) 3) dialog: 'At last she was able to define  love. Love was... ' More KNOCKING.
6) 5) dialog: 'Love was... ' He almost has the rest of the sentence -- the meaning of  love -- but the knocking throws him.
6) 6) dialog: ... Son-of-a-bitch-pansy-assed- stool-pusher. He burst from his chair.
7) 0) text: As Simon hears MELVIN through the door and takes a step  back. Melvin throws open the door. He looks demonic.
7) 1) dialog: (loud and angry)
7) 5) dialog: Well, that's a load off. Melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to  close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery.
7) 7) dialog: Do you realize that I work at  him?
7) 10) dialog: Do you like to be interrupt when  you are danging around in your  little garden?
7) 12) dialog: Well, I work all the time. So  never, never again interrupt me.  Okay? I mean, never. Not 30  years from now... not if there's  fire. Not even if you hear a thud  from inside my home and a week  later there's a smell from in  there that can only come from a  decaying body and you have to hold  a hanky against your face because  the stench is so thick you think  you're going to faint even then  don't come knocking or, if it's  election night and you're excited  and want to celebrate because some  fudge-packer you dated has been  elected the first queer President  of the United States... and he's  going to put you up in Camp David  and you just want to share the  moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for  anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
7) 14) dialog: Okay, then. Melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut.
7) 18) dialog: Oh, I'm pissed!! Now I am really  pissed!!! Frank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open. Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him forward...  Melvin is scared. Operating on survival mode.
7) 19) dialog: No touch. No touch. No touch.
7) 21) dialog: (calling)
7) 26) text: Have a nice day. Party! He tosses Melvin back and walks out. Melvin straightens  his shirt as he steps out into the hall. Frank smiles as  he re-enters the other apartment. Melvin appears  impressed.
8) 0) text: A crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin. His  walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the  danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear. At times he places his palms together and extends his  arms cutting a path through people. We will be very  pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks.
9) 9) text: Eat everything. Melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a  table towards the back and is obviously surprised to find a MAN and WOMAN sitting at the table.
9) 12) dialog: People who talk in metaphors can  shampoo my crotch. (on their look)
9) 13) text: Eat up. They turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the  waitress station where two waitresses, LISA and CAROL,  are talking.
9) 16) dialog: I'm starving.
9) 18) text: Will you please take it? Melvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with  stealth, so that she must touch him again to get him out  of the way... 
9) 24) dialog: I've got Jews at my table.
9) 27) dialog: How much more you got to eat?  Your appetite isn't as big as  your noses, is it?
9) 33) dialog: The table's fine if it had some  cholesterol on it. Two sausages,  six bacon strips, fries, three  eggs over easy and coffee.
9) 35) dialog: We're all gonna die soon. I will.  You will. It sure sounds like  your son will.
9) 38) text: you crazy freak? Do you?!? A beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing  down.
17) 0) text: Carol and LESLIE, another waitress, are waiting for their order at the cappuccino bar. Leslie is telling the story  of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life. Carol is rapt. As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give  him notice. Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so  -- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment  commentary on her every action.
17) 1) dialog: Clippity clop -- clippity clop --  she has to pretend she doesn't  hear me. Listening to the story  from the upset friend...  now she  drops off the cappuccino and  smiles at the putzette who doesn't  even say, "Thank you." No, the  putzette wanted the whipped cream  so back she goes and now she has  to pass him again and it's getting  tougher to make believe.
17) 3) text: Okay. Melvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an  uncharacteristic rabbit punch.
17) 5) dialog: I see the help -- judgement call.
17) 7) dialog: What's wrong with your son,  anyway?
17) 10) dialog: (caught)
17) 13) dialog: His name?
17) 15) dialog: Okay.
21) 0) text: A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is whisked down to the elevator. It's impossible to tell if  Simon is awake or dead. Melvin is standing against the  wall near his door a cop, RAY, interviewing him.
21) 2) dialog: How come you're pretending to do  cop work -- 'cause I don't think  you could find your ass if you  were spotted the hole.
21) 5) dialog: Just move on. No one here killed  him.
21) 7) dialog: Ask him.
22) 6) text: Old bitch...  Damn dog. A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed  and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings...  VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches  his mugger:
22) 8) dialog: (quietly)
23) 1) dialog: Hey, where are you going? You  can't do this. (calls after Frank)
24) 0) text: Melvin enters -- the dog cowers in the shadows. Now  Melvin sees him.
24) 1) dialog: You're dead!! VERDELL STOPS -- gives Melvin wide berth -- slinking  along the far wall. Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a  bit calming.
24) 2) dialog: I don't have dog food. And I  won't want dog food here. You'll  eat what we have. You'll eat what  we eat. Melvin exits. Verdell is in a major funk.
25) 0) text: Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped meat, sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the  room.
25) 1) dialog: Don't you touch anything.
26) 0) text: Verdell cringing as his new master approaches -- MUSIC  CONTINUES ominously. Melvin sets the bowl down and  exits...  Verdell breathes excitedly though looking  alternately in all directions... his recent past making  him suspect this feast is a trick. He sniffs  cautiously -- then dives in -- GOTHIC MUSIC CHANGING on a dime TO SCORE his RAPTURE... from O.S. we hear the sound  of RUNNING WATER as steam escapes the bathroom -- then  MUSIC OUT -- as Melvin returns...  ignoring Verdell he  sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly. It's odd.  Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl  with his tail to Melvin. Then Melvin begins to play and  sing Monty Python's "Always Look On The Bright Side Of  Life," with its cheerful whistle refrain. Verdell looks  over with surprise and pleasure. But just as mood lifts  and warmth threatens, Melvin stops abruptly, turns out  the lights and exits.
30) 0) text: Melvin finishing a plate of eggs, bacon and sausage with  his plastic knife and fork. Carol looks totally beat as  she sets down a cup of coffee. Melvin is craning  periodically to keep an eye of his dog.
30) 2) dialog: Suckered in. Set up. Pushed  around.
30) 4) dialog: Well, not until now -- for  Christ's sake.
30) 6) dialog: It's okay -- I'll sit here. He changes tables for the first time ever so that he can  keep an eye on Verdell. Carol is amazed.
30) 8) dialog: How old are you?
30) 10) dialog: If I had to guess by your eyes,  I'd say you were fifty. Carol looks at him.
30) 12) dialog: (quickly)
30) 16) dialog: What's with the dark? He indicates the bags under her eyes by tapping his own.
30) 18) dialog: No...  no...  leave it...  the  bacon's for the dog. She is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption,  but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty.
30) 19) dialog: Last week I was playing the piano  for him and he likes it, and so I  decide I'm going to make a little  joke... 
31) 0) text: As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a  beat before Melvin, a remarkably event. Verdell is  avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk.
31) 1) dialog: It's a beautiful day for our walk. Melvin slows -- observes the dog mirroring his behavior.
31) 3) dialog: Don't be like me, don't you be  like me. You stay just the way  you are because you are a perfect  man. I'm gonna take you home and  get you something to eat...  what  you love.
31) 7) dialog: (all smiles to Verdell)
32) 0) text: Melvin whaling away at his computer, reading to himself  with great satisfaction as he goes. Verdell sits at his chair, fascinated by the speed of his master's fingers on the keyboard. He reads his writing  aloud to the dog.
32) 1) dialog: "He turned off the gas jets and  carried her outside. He kissed  her brow and when her eyes opened  and found him, he said, 'there are  easier ways to break a date.' She  laughed. The only sensible  ambition he had ever known was now  realized. He had made the girl  happy. And what a girl. 'You've  saved my life,' she said, 'you'd  better make it up to me.'" Exhilarated by his own words, he shuts down the machine..
32) 2) dialog: (singing to Verdell)
32) 5) dialog: Sixty-two books... done! As the dog goes shooting off to the kitchen we leave our  couple's play time for... 
34) 0) text: Frank knocking on Melvin's door. He opens it.
34) 2) dialog: He's a pain in the ass. As he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and,  without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's  surprise.
34) 4) dialog: (leaping at the chance)
34) 7) dialog: (too loudly, weirdly)
35) 0) text: Melvin sits -- Verdell looks up at him. Melvin walks to  the door. He turns the lock... then checks that they are  locked...  checks again to make sure he turned them in th correct direction...  turns from the door...  then back t check once more. And again...  and again...  anguished,  until now he breaks briefly, the dog looking on.
36) 0) text: Melvin opens the door -- looks at the scarred Simon in a  wheelchair and shudders... 
36) 1) dialog: That's some face they left hanging  on you. You look like... 
36) 3) text: Could you take it just a little  easy, Mr. Udall? A beat of silence as Melvin thinks whether to comply.
36) 6) dialog: I called. I never touched you. I  didn't leave my name or nothing.
38) 3) dialog: Over the dog...  an ugly dog. It's hilarious. But now the humor detours. An actual  sob is choked back...  he gets up -- following a definite pattern across the room. He is conducting a small but  highest-stakes fight for survival. Momentarily a scared,  beaten middle-aged man -- he races out the door.
39) 0) text: Melvin charging as fast as crack checks allow and then  turning into a building with a copper sign reading  "Grammercy Park Psychiatric Group."
39) 1) dialog: Worst sidewalk in New York and  look where they put in.
40) 0) text: Melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word.
40) 1) dialog: Help!
40) 3) dialog: Explain to me how you can diagnose  someone as "obsessive compulsive  disorder" and then act like I have  any choice in barging in.
40) 5) dialog: You said you could help me --  what was that -- a tease?
40) 7) dialog: (suddenly)
40) 11) dialog: Shhhhhhh. I don't have this  mountain of available time...  I  got to get to my restaurant on  time. Do you know how hard it is  for me to be here?
41) 0) text: More PATIENTS in the almost-crowded waiting room. Melvin  passes through -- visibly drawn and upset. He stops.  Eyes on them. Then:
41) 1) dialog: (to other patients)
42) 0) text: As he walks to his booth and sits down. Enormous relief.  CHERYL, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his  table -- unseen by Melvin as he takes out his utensils  and arranges them. In a corner booth, four big TRANSIT  AUTHORITY POLICE are having a meal together. Cheryl  looks at his utensils.
42) 2) dialog: No. No. Get Carol.
42) 4) dialog: What are you trying to do to me?
42) 6) dialog: Hey, elephant girl, call her or  something...  just let her do my  one meal here. I'll pay whatever.  I'll wait. (as she doesn't  budge; he screams)
42) 7) text: Do it!!! The MANAGER comes over, gesturing to the table of police  that he can handle it. All attention is on Melvin.
42) 9) dialog: I'll be quiet. Just let me wait.  No problem. Get her here -- have  her get me two sausages, four  bacon, two eggs over easy and  coffee. I'm not a prick here --  I'm a great customer. This day is  a disaster. I can't handle this,  too.
42) 11) dialog: There's going to be trouble??? He walks toward the door as Cheryl and all the other  employees applaud his defeat. As he passes a BUSBOY near  the door he hands him 20 dollars.
42) 12) dialog: Carol's last name?
43) 0) text: An uncomfortable Melvin sitting in the back of a taxi.
43) 1) text: A neighborhood in Brooklyn -- a community. Melvin, ever  the shark observer, looks from the cab to see slices of  community life -- MEN in front of a bar, PARENTS giving  their CHILD a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local  store -- two YOUNG WOMEN discuss dating.
45) 1) dialog: I'm hungry. (on Carol's astonished  look)
45) 4) dialog: This is not a sexist thing. If  you were a waiter I would still be  here saying... 
45) 6) dialog: I am trying to keep emotions out of  this. Even though this is an  important issue to me and I have  strong feelings about the subject.
45) 8) dialog: Yes, I do, as a matter of fact...  and to prove it I have not gotten  personal and you have. Why aren't  you at work? You're not sick --  you don't look sick... just very  tired and bitter.
45) 10) dialog: What about your mother?
45) 12) dialog: I hear you talk when I'm  waiting!!! She crosses to the sink to dump the ice. Melvin takes a  step inside. Spencer, seven and looking ill, walks into  the room.
45) 14) dialog: (uncomfortably)
45) 16) dialog: (miffed)
45) 17) text: You should answer when someone  talks to you...  Carol eyes Melvin with disgust and disbelief then  emphatically gestures him to "clear out." Melvin backs  out the door.
47) 3) dialog: Shut up, kids! They immediately obey as Carol approaches him.
47) 5) dialog: I'll ride up front. Cover your  mouth when you cough, kid.
49) 2) text: I owe you three dollars. Melvin follows behind her as she carries her son... 
49) 3) dialog: Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll  get back to work today?
50) 0) text: Verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for  Melvin. Jackie sits across from Simon's wheel chair...   she has some index cards in her laps which she  occasionally consults and shuffles.
50) 13) text: Here, baby...  what is it,  Verdell?...  You miss the tough  guy...  (trying to be  Melvin-like)
52) 2) dialog: I need this. Just say, "Melvin,  I'll try," okay?
52) 4) text: Melvin, I'll try. They appear now -- the woman tall, attractive, etc. She  pauses at the elevator.
52) 6) dialog: (curtly)
52) 7) text: Great, wonderful. I don't need  you to wait with me. She nods, pissed, waves and leaves. As Melvin waits, Zoe  summons her moxie.
52) 9) dialog: What's it mean?
52) 12) dialog: Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
52) 15) dialog: (as he turns  toward her)
57) 0) text: Nora holding her things, knocks on Melvin's door. Melvin  opens the door. Nora is still sniffling. He misinterprets
57) 1) dialog: Is he dead yet?
57) 3) dialog: Absolutely.
57) 5) dialog: Sure thing.
57) 7) dialog: Where'd they teach you to talk  like this -- some Panama City  "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"?  Or was today getaway day and your  last shot at his whiskey. Sell  crazy some place else -- we're all  stocked up here. He closes the door in her face. She stands there...  thrown by the abruptness -- then lifts the two paper  shopping bags holding her things -- walks back toward the elevator -- pausing briefly outside Simon's door -- then  continues on her way.
60) 12) dialog: Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
60) 15) dialog: It smells like shit in here?
60) 17) dialog: That cleaning woman doesn't... 
60) 19) dialog: Where are all your queer party  friends?
60) 21) text: Get out. Melvin pauses -- Simon weeping... Verdell looks at Simon  with concern. Melvin is thrown. Moved?
60) 23) dialog: Nellie, you're a disgrace to  depression.
60) 25) dialog: No need to stop being a lady...  quit worrying -- you'll be back on  your knees in no time. Simon swings his arm and cast at Melvin -- the sudden  attack jolts Melvin but not as much as what follows.
60) 28) text: Terrified...  Lucky you, you're  here for rock bottom...  me  wallowing in self-pity in front of  you, you absolute horror of a  human being...  As Simon works to stop crying, Melvin is weird with  discomfort.
60) 29) dialog: Well, I'll do one thing for you  that might cheer you up.
60) 31) dialog: Don't piss on a gift, tough guy.  You want to know why the dog  prefers me...  it's not affection.  It's a trick. Simon looks up, his mood turning on a dime -- he's  rapt...  Melvin comes and stands by his wheelchair.
60) 32) dialog: I carry bacon in my pocket.
60) 35) dialog: (hands him bacon)
60) 38) dialog: Yo, yo, yo...  Verdell goes like a bullet to Melvin... who is totally  surprised and staggered by the implications. True love  and such.
60) 40) dialog: Stupid dog. (to Simon)
67) 0) text: As Carol passes Simon's door...  stands in front of  Melvin's apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness  and knocks on the door...  then RINGS the BELL. Finally  Carol hears MUFFLED THROAT CLEARING on the other side  of the door.
67) 2) dialog: Carol the waitress?
67) 5) dialog: I was working...  can't you just  drop me a thank-you note?
67) 8) dialog: (very uncomfortable)
67) 11) dialog: To get you back at work so you can  wait on me.
67) 13) dialog: You waiting for me to say  something? (as she shakes her head)
67) 16) dialog: What needs clearing up?
67) 18) text: I'm not going to sleep with you.  I will never, ever sleep with you.  Never. Not ever. Melvin's reaction? Well, he'll never get credit for the  brief but intense inner struggle -- the struggle not to  scream -- -- not to cry -- to process the sudden and stunning hurt  during his half turn away from her -- and then answer  hoarsely.
67) 19) dialog: I'm sorry. We don't open for the  no-sex oaths until 9 a.m. Carol is amused, surprised...  maybe, in some small way  ever taken by his style...  but top priority is clarity.
67) 21) dialog: Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
67) 23) dialog: So you'll be at work?
68) 0) text: It's a 3:22 a.m. as the two digital clocks on Melvin's  night stand tell us...  He gets up -- the first time we'v seen his waking routine -- taps one foot on the floor  twice -- then the other foot -- two more taps and his  body angles from the bed in a deliberate way. He is having anxiety. He sits at the piano and plays  very briefly...  Stops -- wipes some sweat from his  forehead...  Walks to his computer room -- turns the ligh on and then quickly off...  Walks to his refrigerator... 
69) 4) dialog: I took a chance you were up. Simon walks painfully back to a chair.
69) 5) dialog: I brought you Chinese soup.
69) 7) dialog: I have never been so tired in my  life. Okay, if I sit here?
69) 9) dialog: I haven't been sleeping. I  haven't been clear or felt like  myself. I'm in trouble. Some son  of a bitch is burning my bridges  behind my back...  But the  tiredness -- boy...  Not just  sleepy.
69) 11) dialog: (brightening)
69) 13) dialog: I'm glad we did this. He rises and makes an awkward exit.
69) 14) dialog: Good talking to you. He exits -- Simon puzzled and concerned.
73) 5) text: Can you believe he's eating with  someone. ON MELVIN &amp; FRANK
73) 6) dialog: It's not my dog and this Simon  seems to have enough on his mind  -- but he did throw up twice and  his spark is off.
73) 8) dialog: I did. And his stomach is out of  whack. So they need him for a  couple of days.
73) 11) dialog: What's this?
73) 15) dialog: (to Frank)
73) 19) dialog: "What?" Look at you... You sense  a mark.
73) 21) dialog: About a dog.
73) 23) dialog: Concerned. I'm just the hall  monitor here.
73) 25) dialog: Yeah. If his parents are alive  they've got to help -- those are  the rules. Good.
73) 27) dialog: Think white and get serious. Carol enters scene.
73) 29) dialog: (loudly)
73) 32) dialog: He wants me to take his car and  his client to Baltimore.
73) 34) dialog: Okay. I'll take him. Get him  packed -- ready -- tomorrow  morning. Frank stumbles back... self-satisfied, he relaxes.
73) 35) dialog: (excited)
73) 38) dialog: Last word freak. Frank adjusts and exits... Carol approaches calling a  "good-bye" to him.
73) 40) dialog: Yes. I'm going to give my queer  neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
73) 42) dialog: Hey, what I did for you is working  out?
73) 45) dialog: No... no thank you notes.
73) 47) dialog: Lovely.
73) 49) text: I was sorry for busting you on  that... and I'm sorry for busting  in on you that night... when I  said I was never... I was sorry  and I'm sorry every time your food  was cold and that you had to wait  two seconds for a coffee filler...  Melvin wants to disappear but Carol is getting into it -- emotionally moved by her own words.
73) 51) dialog: Nice of you... thank you.
73) 53) dialog: Now I want you to do something for me. She looks at him for a very strange, long beat.
73) 55) dialog: I want you to go on this trip.
73) 57) dialog: I can't do this alone. I'm afraid  he'll pull the stiff one eye on  me. I need you to chaperon.  Separate everything but cars. You  said you liked convertibles. Now  I'm on the hook.
73) 59) dialog: Two days.
73) 61) dialog: You take off when you have to.
73) 63) dialog: Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
73) 65) text: Melvin, I'd rather not.
73) 66) dialog: What's that got to do with it?
73) 68) dialog: Write me a note and ain't she  sweet. I need a hand and where'd  she go.
73) 70) dialog: Is there another way to see it?
76) 0) text: Melvin is in his bedroom -- everything he's taking neatly stacked on the bed waiting to be packed (he is taking a  camera). He has a list of what he needs. All items --  underwear, socks, etc... with four checks next to each  one and still he -- checks each stack on the bed and adds another check. The PHONE RINGS. This is an amazing  development. He has almost no recent experience with  receiving a nighttime phone call. He makes a little  comment to himself as he moves.
76) 1) dialog: Woo-woo. He stops -- briefly trying to remember where the phone is -- and then, remembering, crosses and picks it up but  before bringing it to his mouth nervously clears his  throat.
76) 4) dialog: Are you still coming?
76) 7) dialog: Just south to Baltimore, Maryland.  So I know what you're going to ask  next. (correcting himself)
76) 10) dialog: Oh. (a beat)
76) 13) dialog: Whether crabs are in season there  now... 
79) 0) text: A female VETERINARIAN in surgical scrubs holds Verdell as Melvin finishes filling out some forms. On opposite sides of the waiting room, a very large black dog and a tiny Chihuahua sit patiently with their owners.
79) 2) dialog: No. Everybody gets their own  cage?
79) 4) dialog: (pointing to  Chihuahua)
81) 2) text: Melvin next to a spiffy convertible. Top down. Trunk open
81) 7) dialog: Soak it up -- it's your last  chance at a hug for a few days. As Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor  changes... that quickly there is a shyness.
81) 9) dialog: Thanks for being on time... Carol,  the waitress, this is Simon, the  fag.
81) 12) dialog: Let's do the small talk in the  car. Load up. Carol puts her bag in the car.
81) 13) dialog: I was going to do that for you.
81) 16) dialog: (totally non-plussed)
81) 21) dialog: Never a break. Never. Carol steps into the back. Melvin disappointed that he's  not sitting next to Carol... Carol is wedged in the small back seat. She struggles to get her feet in. 
81) 22) dialog: You're really jammed back there. He reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his  seat and, with some effort,  wrenches it forward giving  Carol more room and putting his right against the wheel.  She is startled by the gesture.
81) 24) dialog: Welcome. And off they go. Simon and Carol stunned by the manners.
82) 1) dialog: I got the whole ride programmed. CAMERA FOLLOWS as Melvin goes to a rack of CDs -- all  carefully labelled. He selects and begins to play the  one marked "ICEBREAKER." It is a song which we clearly  and quickly judge as off the circumstances -- a quick  burst of "Y.M.C.A." Melvin STOPS the MUSIC and chuckles.
82) 2) dialog: Just wanted to see what you'd do.  No, we have greatness here. He goes for another CD labelled "FOR USE TO REP THINGS 
83) 4) dialog: Doesn't matter. She's enjoying  herself. Consider it part of the  music.
84) 2) dialog: Nonsense!
85) 3) dialog: This stuff is pointless.
85) 5) dialog: You like sad stories -- you want  mine.
85) 8) dialog: (very quickly)
85) 14) dialog: That's not true. Some of us have  great stories... pretty stories  that take place at lakes with  boats and friends and noodle  salad. Just not anybody in this  car. But lots of people -- that's  their story -- good times and  noodle salad... and that's what  makes it hard. Not that you had  it bad but being that pissed that  so many had it good.
85) 17) dialog: (a veteran's irony)
86) 1) dialog: Two bedrooms and the sofa opens...  Carol is on the phone in the living room -- she hangs up.
86) 4) dialog: Yes... sure. (to Simon)
87) 0) text: Melvin watches Simon struggle to unpack his especially  neat suitcase. Melvin is uncomfortable.
87) 1) dialog: Can I ask you a personal question? Simon laughs loudly in apprehension squared.
87) 2) dialog: Do you ever get an erection for a  woman?
87) 4) dialog: Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier  if you were not... 
87) 6) dialog: I give you that one...  (eyes suitcase)
88) 0) text: Carol enters the common living room... Melvin is sitting  there. Carol is dealing with a number of unsettling new  factors in her life.
88) 2) dialog: Dancing?
88) 9) dialog: I'm going to jump in the shower.  I'll be right with you.
90) 2) dialog: They sell hard shell crabs here?
91) 2) dialog: Hi. You have hard shells, right?
91) 4) dialog: Just him and that's it. Okay, you  can answer -- we've worked it out.
91) 6) dialog: What?
91) 8) dialog: No... I'm not wearing that -- and  just in case you were going to ask  I'm not going to let you inject me  with plaque either.
91) 12) dialog: (to Carol)
92) 0) text: As Melvin takes his car back from the valet.
94) 0) text: Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly.
94) 2) dialog: I need a coat and tie.
94) 3) text: CAMERA REVEALS that the floor is intricately patterned so that passage for Melvin is impossible.
94) 5) dialog: No.
94) 7) dialog: (pointing)
95) 2) dialog: You have hard shells?
95) 4) dialog: Everyone else says you do.
96) 0) text: As he enters, looks for and then spot Carol. She is  having a martini at the bar... Sitting on a stool --  watching COUPLES dance... Happy by herself... Turning  down a MAN who wants to buy her another... And Melvin  watches... Watches his date.
96) 2) dialog: No, it's all right. I'll just  watch. He enjoys watching her for a few more beats... She turns  -- Melvin makes a "Haul your ass over here" gesture...  and she smiles and walks toward him... A WAITER has  lifted her drink -- placed it on a tray and follows her.  She takes a bit of a slalom course through the tables,  giddy as the MUSIC PLAYS and couples dance in the b.g.  She notices the waiter in her trail.
96) 4) text: My drink is following me. Melvin watches her approach. It is all too exquisite.  He takes a breath -- it doesn't come easily.
96) 8) dialog: I've been thinking about that  since you brought it up before.
96) 11) dialog: No...  (and before she can  digest that)
96) 14) dialog: No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't  mean it. You gotta sit down. You  can still give me the dirty  look... just sit down and give it  to me.
96) 16) dialog: (really pissed,  mutters)
96) 19) dialog: Okay. He waves her down.
96) 22) dialog: Can we order first? She thinks and then nods. The waiter is across the room.  This does not stop Melvin.
96) 23) dialog: (calling)
96) 27) dialog: (calling)
96) 31) dialog: (to Carol)
96) 34) dialog: Don't be pessimistic. It's not  your style. Okay... Here I  goes... Clearly a mistake. (this is hell  for him)
96) 37) text: I don't quite get how that's a  compliment for me. Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion -- so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly --  then:
96) 38) dialog: You make me want to be a better  man. Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so  slip under her guard. She stumbles a bit -- flattered,  momentarily moved and his for the taking.
96) 40) dialog: Then I've really overshot here  'cause I was aiming at just enough  to keep you from walking out. Carol laughs.
96) 42) dialog: Takes months to know... They work  little by little. (holds his head;  then)
96) 45) dialog: Never.
96) 47) text: for the kiss. Their faces are close -- she looks at  him... She closes her eyes -- her face moving toward him  -- he is wide-eyed and afraid... His face almost moves  away -- in a shot this close it's almost flight... But  now his head moves back and he receives her kiss. It is  brief. Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself.  Melvin can't bear the pleasure.
96) 48) dialog: You don't owe me that.
96) 50) dialog: Well, ah... that's a personal  question.
96) 53) dialog: (dissembling)
96) 57) dialog: It's one idea... 
96) 59) dialog: I don't know why I brought you --  that idea occurred to me is all...  It came out first... Hey, you kiss  him -- me... He says he loves  you. You two hit it off. But you  don't want to... fine... Forget  what I said about sex with Simon.  It was a mistake.
96) 62) dialog: It was a mistake. But she has already turned away and exits the  restaurant... Melvin alone and miserable.
100) 0) text: Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink. He's been talking to  the bartender.
100) 1) dialog: So then, the next thing I know,  she's sitting right next to me,  and then, well, it's not right to  go into the details, but I screwed  up. I got nervous. I said the  wrong thing and if I hadn't, I  could be in bed now with a woman  who if you could make her smile  you got a life. Instead, I'm here  with you, no offense, a moron  pushing the last legal drug. He sits there, just another Joe on a bar stool with his  heart breaking.
102) 0) text: Melvin is having a room service breakfast. The door opens... Simon enters. A new Simon -- better  than ever, clearly happy -- a morning-after glow.
102) 1) dialog: Did you have sex with her? Carol follows his out. Her arms are filled with the  hotel soaps, shampoos, etc.
102) 2) dialog: Sorry, didn't realize she was  right there. (a beat)
102) 7) text: How're you doing? Melvin reacts.
103) 3) dialog: I get why you're angry. It's no  snap to explain why I was like  that, but let's not try to do it  on the run... 
103) 5) dialog: ... Now he's going to want to  stay. And they'll want to take a  ride to the lake or whatever. So  it's a good five hours back. It  gives us a chance to take it easy  and... 
103) 9) dialog: What are you talking about? You  got real problems.
104) 1) dialog: (to Frank over  the phone)
104) 4) dialog: (on phone)
104) 8) dialog: Do it then. Get the dog picked  up. I can't believe you let it  stay there. Melvin hangs up the phone.
104) 9) dialog: Good-bye. (to Simon)
104) 12) dialog: Does it matter? Melvin gets in -- goes to the glove compartment for a  special CD labelled "For Emergency Use Only." As it  PLAYS a confessional love SONGS:
104) 14) dialog: What do you mean? You said you  liked it.
104) 16) dialog: This one has a special meaning.
105) 1) dialog: Here are the keys to my apartment.  I'm going to park you in my place  while I take Carol home.
105) 4) dialog: I'll take you... why not?
105) 11) dialog: Don't say anything.
107) 1) dialog: I told you to go on in.
107) 3) dialog: I think you gotta camp it here... 
107) 6) text: I know the feeling -- you feel  like your ol' self again, huh? -- Mommy and Daddy are home. Melvin reacts.
107) 8) text: Melvin gets up... Simon notices some of his paintings.
107) 9) dialog: They took your place furnished.  Jackie said she grabbed your  personal stuff -- they were  supposed to set you up here. (leading the way)
108) 2) dialog: They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
108) 4) dialog: I'll tell you, buddy, I'd be the  luckiest guy alive if that did it  for me.
110) 0) text: Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart... each around 1:55 a.m... He sits in a chair still fully  dressed... forlorn... Verdell in his lap. A beat then we  hear Simon's whispered voice.
110) 4) dialog: Look, we both want the dog --  and...  The PHONE RINGS... they look at each other. Melvin  doesn't move.
110) 9) text: Hello. It's me. He took me in.  Did you know? Hold on, I'll get  him for you. He walks back to Melvin's room.
111) 2) dialog: Here. Take the dog. As he speeds him out... 
112) 0) text: As Melvin picks up the phone... He clears his throat  loudly. Following is INTERCUT between Carol and Melvin  -- the first such CUT showing Carol blasted by the throat clearing.
112) 1) dialog: Hello.
112) 3) dialog: (very concerned)
112) 6) dialog: That seems like a good choice.
112) 8) dialog: The two might go together.
112) 10) dialog: (what the hell)
112) 14) dialog: Okay to say something now?
112) 16) dialog: I should've danced with you.
112) 18) dialog: So long. Carol hangs up. She feels strange. A shoe hasn't dropped. Oh, hell... she missed him.
113) 0) text: Melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room. He  is impatient.
113) 1) dialog: You going to come talk to me or  not?
113) 4) dialog: I'm a great guy --  "extraordinary"...  (before Simon can  celebrate)
113) 9) dialog: (sharply)
113) 13) dialog: I don't know... Let me sleep on it  and figure it out. (then)
113) 16) dialog: (furiously)
113) 20) dialog: Well, if that's true then I'm  really in trouble.
113) 22) dialog: Absolutely not.
113) 24) dialog: Hey... I'm charged here. But she  might kill me for showing up this  late.
113) 26) dialog: Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go. He moves for the door... stops suddenly, jolted.
113) 28) dialog: I forgot to lock the door.
115) 0) text: As Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great  uncertainty.
116) 0) text: Carol in a cotton wrap-around dress/bathrobe... sitting  directly in front of a fan... the windows open, reading  one of Melvin's books...  There is the briefest possible sound of a DOORBELL...  someone has jabbed her downstairs button ever so briefly  -- so briefly that she's not certain it's her DOORBELL -- until the same brief sound REPEATED... She walks to  her wide open window and looks over.
117) 0) text: As Melvin gives up and starts out... turning as the  sudden blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds.  He bolts for the door and enters.
118) 0) text: She opens the door... she hears the sound of MELVIN  SOUNDING HEAVILY up the stairs... He reaches her side.
118) 2) dialog: Were you asleep?
118) 4) dialog: 'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm  sorry. And you could be grouchy.
118) 6) dialog: ... 'Cause of being woken up, and  it would make my job impossible.  So then I wouldn't even try.
118) 8) dialog: Were you asleep?
118) 12) dialog: I'm sorry I woke you -- some other  time. He half turns to leave.
118) 14) dialog: What a break... 
118) 17) dialog: I had to see you... 
118) 19) dialog: It relaxes me... I'd feel better  just sitting on the curb in front  of your house than anyplace else  I can think of or imagine. Carol has not ever heard anything like that before...  it's sort of sexy in its sincerity.
118) 20) text: As we see in the b.g. that Beverly, standing near her  door down the hallway, has heard at least this last  part...  Melvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone... 
118) 21) dialog: (serious)
118) 27) dialog: (hopefully)
118) 30) dialog: Maybe we could live without the  wise cracks. She looks at him -- then:
118) 32) dialog: It feels a little confined here.  Let's take a walk.
118) 34) dialog: If you need an excuse, there's a  bakery on the corner. There's a  shot it'll open soon -- that way  we're not screwy -- we're just  two people who like warm rolls.
119) 0) text: They walk quietly -- Melvin still walking with his usual  attention to where he steps.
119) 1) text: Melvin walking -- and though we can see an improvement -- it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids  stepping on the lines.
119) 4) text: I'm sorry, Melvin -- but whatever  this is -- is not going to work.
119) 6) dialog: I'm feeling... I've been feeling  better.
119) 9) dialog: Hey, I've got a great compliment  for you.
119) 11) dialog: Just let me talk. (gathers himself  with uncertainty,  then:)
119) 15) dialog: I think most people miss that  about you and I watch wondering  how they can watch you bring them  food and clear their dishes and  never get that they have just met  the greatest woman alive... And  the fact that I get it makes me  feel great... about me! (a real question  filled with  concern for her)
119) 18) dialog: (tentatively)
119) 21) dialog: I know I can do better. They embrace again. He does indeed do much better. A  first-class smooch. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to see his foot  land squarely on a crack in the sidewalk without his  knowledge. They break -- look at each other without a  notion of where to take it from here, and the ALMOST in  unison begin to walk away FROM CAMERA, Melvin following a path that avoids cracks. Suddenly the lights of the  bakery turn on as it opens for business.
