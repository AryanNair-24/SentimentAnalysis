9) 5) dialog: You know all my son's stuff,  right? The Mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but  Carol interrupts her.
9) 6) dialog: No, no, no, I got a date tonight.  I'm walking out the door this  morning and he says to me, 'Mom,  I promise not to get one of my  fevers or coughs during your  date.'

9) 13) text: Eat up. They turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the  waitress station where two waitresses, LISA and CAROL,  are talking.
9) 15) dialog: I owe you. I told you today...  them's the rules. Oh, excuse me,  Melvin. She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out  of the way. He gulps at the contact (since no one else  ever touches him) but covers his self-consciousness.
9) 17) dialog: (firmly to Lisa)
9) 20) dialog: "Ready" is not my problem. She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could  read Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the date talk. To Carol he is as harmless as furniture.
9) 21) dialog: (to Melvin)
9) 23) dialog: I know. He's just the best.
9) 25) dialog: It's not your table. It's the  place's table. Behave. This  once, you can sit at someone  else's station. The two waitresses signal their protests.
9) 26) dialog: Or you can just wait your turn...  Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper...  he hangs near their table...  his discomfort builds in this limbo. then:
9) 32) dialog: Bryan says he doesn't care how  long you've been coming you ever  act like this again you're barred  for life. I'm gonna miss the  excitement, but I'll handle it. There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some  ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only  one in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear  the table.
9) 34) dialog: You're gonna die soon with that  diet, you know that?
9) 37) dialog: If you ever mention my son again,  you will never be able to eat here  again. Do you understand? Give me  some sign you understand or leave  now. Do you understand me...  (adds truthful label)
9) 39) dialog: Okay. I'll get your order. She walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower  lip. He takes some napkins and cleans the table himself.
10) 2) dialog: I...  I...  I don't know...  You got  me. His eyes try to burn into hers... She is getting excited  but doesn't know how to play it...  He pushes one of the  fingers of the hand caressing her face toward her  mouth...  She closes her teeth, his fingers attempt  opening her mouth. She stops him.
10) 3) dialog: Let me just do whatever I do by  myself...  I'll catch up to you  someplace I promise. (as he's put off)
10) 5) dialog: Kissing...  kissing boys. Oh my. Carol pulls her head away -- as Spencer's call continues.

11) 0) text: Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway... she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her  mother, BEVERLY, is listening to music on headphones...  she takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the  cough.
12) 2) dialog: Don't be silly. How bad?
13) 1) dialog: (a bit panicked)
13) 3) dialog: Oh, God...  I don't even notice  anymore. She crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel. Tries to make light.
13) 4) dialog: That'll teach you.
13) 6) dialog: (perturbed)
13) 8) dialog: Hey...  this is just a little throw- up -- it's nothing to be so  embarrassed about. Really. (as he shifts  uncomfortably)

Carol is rapt. As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give  him notice. Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so  -- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment  commentary on her every action.
17) 2) dialog: (reluctant forgiveness)
17) 4) dialog: What's with the plastic picnic  ware? Why not try ours...  afraid  it isn't clean?
17) 6) dialog: Just give yourself a little pep  talk. "Must try other people's  clean silverware as part of the  fun of dining out."
17) 8) dialog: What do you care? Melvin just looks at her.
17) 9) dialog: He's gotta fight to breathe.  His asthma can just shoot off the  charts -- he's allergic to dust  and this is New York and his  immune system bails on him when  there's trouble so an ear  infection...  Is this bothering  you?
17) 12) dialog: An ear infection can send us to  the emergency room -- maybe five,  six times a month where I get  whatever nine-year-old they just  made a doctor. Nice chatting with  you.

30) 3) dialog: You're not worried that someone  might take him?
30) 5) dialog: Sorry.
30) 7) dialog: You know he's a little dog. Next  time, if Bryan's not here, you can  bring him in.
30) 9) dialog: Oh, please... 
30) 11) dialog: And if I had to guess by your  eyes. I'd say you were kind. So,  so much for eyes. But as long as  you bring up age...  how old are  you?
30) 14) dialog: (laughs out loud)
30) 17) dialog: Dawn patrol -- major dawn patrol.  My son had a full blown attack.  And this time, for extra fun, they  gave us the wrong antibiotics, so  I get him home...  She reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon -- he goes  nuts.
30) 20) dialog: You all set here? Melvin nods -- a bit frustrated about not being able to  finish his dog story. He pockets the remaining bacon.
45) 0) text: Carol opens the door just as he arrives on her landing.  She holds a container of ice, washclothes and a  thermometer.
45) 3) dialog: What are you doing here? Melvin ignores the question, instead answering a charge  he had imagined she might make... 
45) 5) dialog: Are you totally gone? This is my  private home... 
45) 7) dialog: What subject? That I wasn't there  to take crap from you and bring  you eggs? Do you have any control  over how creepy you allow yourself  to get?
45) 9) dialog: My son is sick, okay? Even saying the sentence, "My son is sick" pushes some  emotions toward the surface which are wasted on the crazy man at her threshold.
45) 11) dialog: How do you know about my mother?
45) 13) dialog: Sorry, honey...  I'll be right  there.
45) 17) text: You should answer when someone  talks to you...  Carol eyes Melvin with disgust and disbelief then  emphatically gestures him to "clear out." Melvin backs  out the door.
45) 18) dialog: Sorry. There is a limit, Melvin,  and I can't handle you teaching  my son manners. She closes the door in his face, then walks to her son  and leads him back to his room.

47) 4) dialog: Melvin...  give us a lift. We've  got to go see our friends at the  hospital. Melvin is thrown...  he pauses a beat...  then holds the  rear door open as Carol hustles the kid inside. The  maneuver puts the beet red, sweating Spencer at his face.

55) 40) dialog: Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of  shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
55) 42) dialog: Once the tests come back, is there  someone I can reach in your office  for the results?
55) 44) dialog: His home number. Carol look at her mother -- they share a laugh. Beverly  has a hard time stopping.
55) 45) dialog: (to doctor)
55) 48) dialog: No. She starts towards Spencer's room.
55) 50) dialog: Doc!!! (then)

67) 0) text: As Carol passes Simon's door...  stands in front of  Melvin's apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness  and knocks on the door...  then RINGS the BELL. Finally  Carol hears MUFFLED THROAT CLEARING on the other side  of the door.
67) 1) dialog: Uh, Udall?
67) 3) dialog: Yes. As we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her  breasts and gasps. She grasps the fabric and holds it  straight out just as Melvin opens the door. His hair is  static city, standing on end as he periodically gives it  self-conscious pats.
67) 4) dialog: The doctors had your billing  address. I'm sorry about the  hour.
67) 6) dialog: That's not why I'm here...  (tearing suddenly)
67) 10) dialog: Why did yo do this for me?
67) 12) dialog: But you do have some idea how  strange that sounds??? I'm  worried that you did this  because...  She pauses -- the beginning of an extraordinarily long  silence. Finally.

We MOVE IN and read over  Carol's shoulder -- "I'm sorry to have gotten sloppy and  emotional in this letter, but it would have been on my  conscionce (sic) forever if I didn't tell you how  gratefull (sic)... "
70) 2) dialog: I'm on the last page. How do you  spell conscience?
70) 4) dialog: I still don't feel safe leaving  Spencer with someone. How do you  spell it again?
70) 7) dialog: (more emotionally  than she intended)
70) 9) text: This can't be right -- con- science. Carol breathes heavily -- gets control, stopping herself  on the brink of crying.
70) 11) dialog: I don't know... It's very strange  not feeling that stupid panic  thing inside you all the time.  Without that you just start  thinking about yourself -- and  what does that ever get anybody.  Today, on the bus there was this  adorable couple and I felt myself  giving them a dirty look -- I had  no idea everything was... 
70) 13) dialog: (great, forceful  hand gestures)
70) 18) dialog: Leave me be! Why are you doing  this? Why are you picking at my  sores... What is it that you  want?... You want what? What's  with you? I hope getting me  thinking of everything that's  wrong when all I want is to not  do this has some purpose. (puffy; red;  furious)
70) 19) text: What is it, Mom? No kidding. Slumped, fought out -- Carol gets out one last, naked  husky voiced question.

70) 22) dialog: (simply)
71) 1) dialog: (to Sean)
71) 5) dialog: Okay -- we're out of here. I love  you. Spencer nods -- involved with Sean. CAMERA FOLLOWS Carol  as she exits the apartment -- her mother leading.  Halfway down the stairs, she stops and reverses herself,  going back to the apartment which she re-enters -- then  to her son to ask:
71) 6) dialog: Do you love me?
72) 0) text: Beverly and Carol walking past the store windows. A  simple and unprecedented experience in their recent  lives.
73) 0) dialog: As Carol stands nervously while Lisa finishes reading her 14-page letter. In the b.g. Melvin and Frank are seated  at the same table and in earnest conversation. Lisa  keeps flicking away tears -- a few drops on the pages.
73) 1) dialog: Don't get it wet. Lisa brushes the paper -- finishes and embraces Carol.
73) 2) dialog: So it's okay?
73) 4) dialog: I wanted him to know how much he'd  done. (looking over)
73) 10) dialog: Melvin. She self-consciously hands him with the thick envelope.
73) 12) dialog: (sotto)
73) 13) text: A thank-you note for what you did  for me. He hands it back to her deliberately. She takes it and  walks back to the service area where, embarrassed,  confused, and messed with -- she tosses the note. After Carol leaves... 
73) 31) dialog: Getting loud, getting loud.
73) 33) dialog: I want your life for a minute  where my big problem is someone  offers me a free convertible so I  can get out of this city. She exits. Frank prepares to depart.
73) 39) dialog: So. Anything else?
73) 41) dialog: Okay.
73) 43) dialog: (a breath; then)
73) 46) dialog: Well, part of what I said in this  entire history of my life which  you won't read is that somehow  you've done more for my mother, my  son and me, than anyone else ever  has... And that makes you the most  important, surprising, generous  person I've ever met and that you  be in our daily prayers forever.
73) 48) dialog: I also wrote one part... I wrote  I'm sorry... I was talking about I  was sorry when I got mad at you  when you came over and you told my  son that he ought to answer back  so I wrote that. (reading from the  letter, Melvin  wildly uncomfortable)
73) 49) text: I was sorry for busting you on  that... and I'm sorry for busting  in on you that night... when I  said I was never... I was sorry  and I'm sorry every time your food  was cold and that you had to wait  two seconds for a coffee filler...  Melvin wants to disappear but Carol is getting into it -- emotionally moved by her own words.
73) 50) dialog: ... and I'm sorry for never  spotting, right there at the table  in the restaurant, the human being  that had it in him to do this  thing for us... You know what, I'm  just going to start from the  beginning... I have not been able  to express my gratefulness to  you... even as I look at the word  "grateful" now it doesn't begin to  tell you what I feel for you...  And finally Carol notes Melvin's mood and pauses.
73) 52) dialog: Thank you.
73) 54) dialog: Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say,  "what?" I thought I said,  "what?"... What?
73) 56) dialog: No, sir... 
73) 58) dialog: The stiff one eye?

74) 1) dialog: Well, here's a little suitcase  shocked that it's been used. She holds up a dress -- a pretty one... then decides it's too pretty and puts it back... Now she looks in another  drawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries  of the ages. She hesitates then talks to herself.
74) 3) dialog: (furiously exasperated)
76) 3) dialog: Hello?
76) 5) dialog: Yes. Melvin visibly relaxes.
76) 6) dialog: Melvin... I'd like to know exactly  where we are going.
76) 9) dialog: There's... there's no need to  bring anything dressy... or... I  mean -- I didn't know if we'd be  eating at any restaurant that  have dress codes.
76) 12) dialog: Okay, gotcha. What did you think  I was going to ask?
76) 14) dialog: Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good  night.
77) 2) dialog: Stop treating this like I'm going  away with a man. He's just going  to say those crappy, sick,  complaining, angry things to me.  I hate this, Mom -- I hate this.  He's a freak show -- the worst  person I ever met.
78) 1) dialog: (to Spencer)

81) 10) dialog: Hello... Oh, my God, who did that  to you?
81) 14) dialog: (taken aback)

83) 1) dialog: I don't know the last time I've  been out of the city... Hey, my  arms are tanning. I used to tan  great. We gotta stop soon so'se  I can check on Spencer.
84) 0) text: A short time later. Carol is now driving.
84) 1) dialog: I'm sure, Simon, they did  something real off for you to feel  this way... But when it comes to  your partners -- or your kid --  things will always be off for you  unless you set it straight. Maybe  this thing happened to you just to  give you that chance.
84) 3) dialog: Anybody here who's interested in  what Melvin has to say raise their  hands. Simon does not raise his hand. Simon and Carol have thus  declared their majority.
84) 5) dialog: Yes. I really would.
84) 7) dialog: No, let me pull over so I can pay  full attention. Car pulling over toward parking spot.
85) 1) dialog: Now go ahead. Simon looks back at Melvin as does Carol. He looks  innocent. Several beats -- Melvin almost says something  -- a hidden hand gesture from Carol stops him. Finally.
85) 4) dialog: Hey -- you let him... 
85) 10) dialog: Go ahead, Simon. Your father  walked in on you and was yelling  and... really, come on.
85) 12) text: And he said to me, "I don't want  you to ever come back." I grabbed  him and I hugged him... He turns  and walked out. Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as  strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so  much more complicated than her meat and potatoes  troubles. She looks out her window -- then kisses her  fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek. A nice,  understated, gesture of friendship.
85) 13) dialog: Well, you know -- I still stay  what I said. You've got to get  past it all when it comes to your  parents. We all have these horror  stories to get over. Melvin shifts INTO the FRAME.
85) 15) dialog: No.
86) 2) dialog: (to Simon)
86) 5) text: I'll take the sofa. Carol walks into her room -- the nicest room she'll ever  have slept in... She goes to the phone and dials...

96) 7) dialog: You wanna dance?
96) 9) dialog: (rising)
96) 15) dialog: Melvin, pay me a compliment... I  need one and quick... You have no  idea how much what you said just  hurt my feelings.
96) 18) dialog: That's not compliment, Melvin...  That's just trying to sound smart  so I feel stupid... A compliment  is something nice about somebody  else... Now or never.
96) 20) dialog: (sitting)
96) 24) text: Two crab dinners and pitcher of  cold beer. (to Carol)
96) 26) dialog: Fries.

96) 43) text: Talking like this is exhausting. Carol moves to the chair next to him... She sits very  close -- he tenses.
96) 44) dialog: Have you ever let a romantic  moment make you do something you  know is stupid?
96) 46) dialog: Here's the trouble with never.
96) 47) text: for the kiss. Their faces are close -- she looks at  him... She closes her eyes -- her face moving toward him  -- he is wide-eyed and afraid... His face almost moves  away -- in a shot this close it's almost flight... But  now his head moves back and he receives her kiss. It is  brief. Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself.  Melvin can't bear the pleasure.
96) 49) dialog: That wasn't payment. When you  first came into breakfast, when I  saw you -- I thought you were  handsome... Then, of course, you  spoke... So now that your soft  li'l underbelly is all exposed.  Tell me, why did you bring me? Melvin's voice is soft -- hesitant, okay, vulnerable...  as he holds up his hands in a "stop" signal.
96) 51) dialog: Tell me even if you're scared.  Tell me why you wanted me here.  It's okay. She kisses him again.
96) 52) dialog: If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
96) 55) dialog: (humiliated)
96) 58) dialog: That's why you brought me? Look  at me! Is that really why you  brought me... Like I'm a what and  I owe you what?!

99) 5) dialog: I don't think so. You need help  with the pants?
99) 8) dialog: I'm going to take a big bath and  order a big meal.
99) 10) dialog: I'm sorry... are you okay?
99) 12) dialog: Why? What have you been thinking  about?
99) 14) dialog: Can you believe in our little mix  you're the good roommate. Simon laughs -- as she crosses to the bathroom and begins to prepare a bath.
99) 17) dialog: Good night. We are ON Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or  sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he  faces the bathroom and we have... 
99) 18) text: Carol sitting at tub's edge -- a towel around her and now as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair -- the towel falls -- a better than perfect breast  exposed... 
99) 22) text: What's he up to... he takes the blotter from the desk set and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of  the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol.
99) 24) dialog: No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer  than you think. I give the wrong  impression sometimes and...

But there were extraordinary  kindnesses that did take place.  So thanks for the trips...  She's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than  ever. It's hard to know whether to die or not.
