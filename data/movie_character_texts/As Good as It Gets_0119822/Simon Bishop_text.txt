2) 1) dialog: Verdell!?!! Here, good doggie...  He notices Melvin at the far end of the hall.
2) 3) dialog: Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey  there! (as Melvin turns)
2) 5) text: What's he look like? Melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is directly opposite Simon's. SIMON
2) 7) text: I got it. You're talking about  your dog. I thought that was the  name of the colored man I've been  seeing in the hall. Simon looks O.S. -- and sees his black friend. SIMON
2) 9) text: Like thick molasses, with one of  those wide noses perfect for  smelling trouble and prison  food...  Simon has had it. SIMON
2) 12) dialog: Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I  think you know that.
2) 14) text: Simon, you've got to get dressed.
2) 17) dialog: (to Frank)
2) 21) dialog: (directly)
2) 22) text: You don't love anything, Mr.  Udall. Simon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the  hallway.
5) 1) dialog: who looks up -- lights up -- and tears up as he moves  quickly toward the group and his dog.
5) 2) dialog: Thank the good Lord... wow... my  honey... where have you been?
5) 4) text: He always liked me. As Simon goes past him to take the dog from the  Handyman... JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a  laugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As  the others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside.  Jackie lingers, looking on affectionately as Simon picks  some awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body... he puts  Verdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS in protest.
5) 5) dialog: Just for a second, okay? The DOG YAPS "no." Simon, delighted, picks him up again.
5) 6) dialog: (kissing him on the mouth)
5) 9) text: In the basement garbage bin eating  diaper shit. Simon reacts -- then notices the Handyman, tongue in  cheek, trying to suppress his amusement.
5) 10) dialog: Go ahead, John, you earned your fun. (looking at Verdell)
5) 13) dialog: My God! No! He stares out... Frank frustrated following.
6) 2) dialog: Mr. Udall. But Melvin's into it. His fingers flying as he reads.
6) 4) dialog: Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you  please.
7) 0) text: As Simon hears MELVIN through the door and takes a step  back. Melvin throws open the door. He looks demonic.
7) 3) dialog: Maybe this can wait. Frank signals encouragement as Melvin opens the door.
7) 4) dialog: I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
7) 6) dialog: Did you... do something to him?
7) 8) dialog: (eyes downcast)
7) 11) dialog: No...  actually, I even shut the  phone off and put a little piece  of cardboard in the ringer so no  one can just buzz me from d... 
7) 13) dialog: Yes. It's not a subtle point  you're making.
7) 15) dialog: So the theory of confrontations is  that now he'll think twice before  messing with me? Frank smiles affectionately. Simon turns serious.
7) 16) dialog: He's genuinely upsetting, isn't  he?
14) 6) text: Look, I just can't. I promised  Simon I'd find him a model.
15) 0) text: There is a KNOCK at the door -- Simon crosses to answer.  He is more relaxed than we've seen him -- a man at peace  humming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who  scratches at the door. Simon opens the door to Vincent.
15) 1) dialog: Sorry, I was out in the studio  doing some work and I forgot about  our appointment. He leads the way back toward the studio -- chatting away  -- unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him  and eyeing the expensive apartment.
15) 2) dialog: I usually make such a big deal out  of picking models but Carl's so  thorough. I'll bet he drove you  nuts checking your references. And he turns and sees the naked model.
15) 3) dialog: (taken aback)
16) 0) text: Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the  increasingly uneasy Simon.
16) 1) dialog: Exactly what is your previous  experience?
16) 4) text: Give me some direction. Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive. He  tries not to show it.
16) 5) dialog: Nothing. I just watch till  something strikes me. Do anything  you think of -- try different  thing. Until I say, "hold that  pose." Then just try and  comfortably hold it.
16) 8) dialog: No...  Okay. What I do is watch  and wait for, um... You ever watch  someone who doesn't know you're  watching...  an old woman on a bus,  kids going to school and you see  this flash come over them and you  know immediately that it has  nothing to do with anything  external -- that it's in respond  to a private thought they just  had? They are just sort of realer  and more alive. And when you  notice it so are you. If you look  at someone long enough, you  discover their humanity. Vincent's slack-jawed expression changes. He feels an  intellectual tingle to be having this conversation.
16) 10) dialog: Hold it. Vincent does so -- hums a bit of "Satisfaction" to  celebrate.
18) 0) text: The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary, as Simon puts  the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent. A beat  and then a strange figure crosses between the CAMERA and  the scene -- gone before we can examine him further.
18) 1) dialog: You can put on anything you want  now. I might be sort of done  here...  Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his  immediate needs and puts it on -- dying a little at every second of silence during the transition... then LOUD  MUSIC PLAYS...  Vincent even GOOSING the VOLUME. Simon  does a take -- he gestures Vincent to take it down --  which Vincent does.
19) 0) text: MUSIC PLAYS -- Simon cleaning up his stuff.
19) 2) dialog: Yes...  well, there's one more  stage -- trying to figure out if  it's any good. Simon sneaks a look at the canvas from another  perspective...  he focuses -- then the smallest shy nod  of self-approval -- he's finished. Vincent is desperate  to distract. CLOSE ON dog as Verdell awakens, stretches and pricks his ears. He moves quickly to the closed door and starts to  frantically scratch, attracting Simon's attention. As Simon keeps walking...  Vincent shoots over to the  canvas.
19) 4) dialog: Just a second -- he has to go.
20) 0) text: Doug and Evan are nearly to the front door as VERDELL  stops them with a vicious GROWL and BARK. Simon is distracted -- looking down at his pet so that he continues to walk toward Doug and Evan, not noticing  them -- Vincent, terribly afraid, appears behind Simon.
20) 1) dialog: (to Vincent)
20) 4) dialog: Why are you doing this?
21) 0) text: A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is whisked down to the elevator. It's impossible to tell if  Simon is awake or dead. Melvin is standing against the  wall near his door a cop, RAY, interviewing him.
28) 2) dialog: I haven't looked at myself yet. I  figured I could tell from your  reaction. He turns toward her. Much of his body -- taped -- his  painting hand wrapped. Simon's face is something of a  horror. Swollen, one savage discolored cut. We are into  yuccchhh...  The sight is a jolt. Jackie breaks into  tears...  sobs, actually.
28) 3) dialog: That bad, huh? They share a helpless half-laugh -- then Frank appears in the doorway.
28) 6) dialog: Jackie, will you hand me the  mirror?
28) 10) dialog: So, what's new anyway? How's  Verdell?
28) 13) dialog: (suddenly alive and upset)
28) 16) dialog: You are very certain my dog is  okay...  because you have no  idea... 
28) 18) dialog: Okay, waiting gives the devil  time. Now! He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror... he is startled -- the bottom drops out -- leaving him  awed by his misfortune.
28) 19) dialog: Oh my... Where'd I go? Ummmm?
33) 0) text: As the rookie invalid awakens in precisely the same foul  mood he'd had on falling asleep. In the living room, the  maid, NORA, is talking with Jackie -- we catch only a few words as they review Simon's mounting pile of bills and  talk of how long Nora can stay on.
36) 0) text: Melvin opens the door -- looks at the scarred Simon in a  wheelchair and shudders... 
36) 2) dialog: (interrupting)
36) 4) dialog: Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart? (to Melvin)
36) 7) dialog: (not listening)
36) 10) dialog: Hi, sweetheart. Verdell isn't eager.
37) 0) text: Simon pats his leg -- trying unsuccessfully to get  Verdell to approach him. Instead the dog goes to the  door and scratches at it. Jackie starts to pick the dog  up.
37) 1) dialog: No. Please, don't force him.
50) 0) text: Verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for  Melvin. Jackie sits across from Simon's wheel chair...   she has some index cards in her laps which she  occasionally consults and shuffles.
50) 2) dialog: Sorry. What are those cards?
50) 5) dialog: (scared shitless)
50) 8) text: Simon, you're broke.
50) 11) dialog: Well, I can't reach them. Verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off. He turns  for:
50) 12) dialog: (to Verdell)
50) 18) dialog: I'll be able to keep my apartment  and studio, won't I?...  Just tell  me. As Jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card.
50) 19) dialog: (overwhelmed)
56) 0) text: Simon practices walking using his cane. A tearstained  Nora hugs him good-bye.
56) 2) dialog: Let's use just one poor, okay?  Anyway, dear, thanks for  everything. Forgive my recent  crankiness and as soon as things  are on track again I'll call. She kisses him and starts for the door and suddenly a  sharp intake of breath -- she's forgotten something.
56) 3) dialog: What's wrong?
56) 5) dialog: No, no.
60) 0) text: Shades drawn. Simon is a wheelchair...  the PHONE RINGS.  He goes to answer... the phone across the bed so that  reaching for the phone is a brief but difficult  struggle... he grunts with pain, hope and anxiety as he  answers.
60) 1) dialog: Hello?...  yes...  sure...  finally,  huh? Why, "finally"? Because I  called you so many times. Maybe  20. (relief)
60) 4) dialog: Carl, I need some help and you're  the logical one to turn to. (aghast)
60) 7) dialog: "Will you please loan me money? I  will pay you back. I will give  you whatever percentage of my  income I don't absolutely need  until I do. It will take a while.  But I don't know what I'll do if  you say"... that. (as he listens)
60) 11) dialog: A lonely figure -- who now holds his good hand up to his  face and appears on the verge of enormous emotional  release -- CAMERA MOVES TOWARD him as if to rendezvous  with the moment of catharsis...  ...  but Simon is denied even this small luxury as the  CAMERA ABRUPTLY ADJUSTS just as he begins sobbing to  focus on the door opening and Melvin and Verdell entering the room.
60) 13) dialog: Thank you for walking him. Simon wheels away from Melvin.
60) 14) dialog: If you'll excuse me I'm not  feeling so well.
60) 16) dialog: Go away.
60) 18) dialog: Please, just leave.
60) 20) dialog: (his first shout)
60) 21) text: Get out. Melvin pauses -- Simon weeping... Verdell looks at Simon  with concern. Melvin is thrown. Moved?
60) 22) dialog: Nothing worse than having to feel  this way in front of you?
60) 24) dialog: Rot in hell, Melvin.
60) 26) dialog: Is this fun for you? Well, you  lucky devil...  It just gets better  and better. I am losing my  apartment and Frank wants me to  promise to paint hotter subjects  and to beg my parents, who haven't  called, for help... and I won't.  And I don't want to paint anymore. Melvin has made for the door...  Simon blocks him.
60) 27) dialog: So the life I was trying for is  over. The life I had is gone and  I am feeling so damn sorry for  myself that it is difficult to  breathe. Right times for you --  huh, Melvin. The gay neighbor is  terrified...  (a sudden screamed  word surprises them  both)
60) 28) text: Terrified...  Lucky you, you're  here for rock bottom...  me  wallowing in self-pity in front of  you, you absolute horror of a  human being...  As Simon works to stop crying, Melvin is weird with  discomfort.
60) 30) dialog: Get out.
60) 33) dialog: (pleased)
60) 37) dialog: Come on, sweetheart... 
60) 39) dialog: Would you leave now, please?
60) 41) text: I don't get it. He exits...  looking apologetically at Simon in stoic  ruin.
67) 0) text: As Carol passes Simon's door...  stands in front of  Melvin's apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness  and knocks on the door...  then RINGS the BELL. Finally  Carol hears MUFFLED THROAT CLEARING on the other side  of the door.
69) 2) text: He knocks of Simon's door...  It opens quickly.
69) 6) dialog: Thanks.
69) 8) dialog: Got any easier questions? Melvin sits and moans -- the dog sitting near him.
69) 10) dialog: But sick -- nauseous -- where  everything looks distorted and  everything inside just aches --  when you can barely get up the  will to complain.
81) 3) text: He is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the  tussle Frank and Simon are having just inside the  building.
81) 5) dialog: (upset)
81) 6) text: So am I, Frank. Frank starts to leave -- Simon stops him. They embrace.
81) 11) dialog: I, uh... I was... attacked.  Walked in on people robbing me. I  was hospitalized. I almost died.
81) 20) dialog: That's very thoughtful.
83) 2) dialog: (during the above)
84) 4) dialog: Do you want to know what happened  with my parents?
84) 6) dialog: Well... 
85) 2) dialog: Well, I always painted. Always.  And my mother always encouraged  it. She was sort of fabulous  about it actually... and she used  to... I was too young to think  there was anything at all wrong  with it... and she was very  natural. She used to pose nude  for me... and I thought or assumed  my father was aware of it.
85) 7) dialog: Okay. Well, one day my father  came in on one of those painting  sessions when I was nine -- and he  just started screaming at her --  at us -- at evil. And... 
85) 11) dialog: I was trying to defend my mother  and make peace, in the lamest way.  I said, "she's not naked -- it's  art." And then he started hitting  me. And he beat me unconscious.  After that he talked to me less  and less -- he knew before I left  for college, my dad came into my  room. He held out his hand. It  was filled with money. A big wad  of sweaty money. (gathers himself)
85) 12) text: And he said to me, "I don't want  you to ever come back." I grabbed  him and I hugged him... He turns  and walked out. Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as  strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so  much more complicated than her meat and potatoes  troubles. She looks out her window -- then kisses her  fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek. A nice,  understated, gesture of friendship.
85) 16) dialog: Not it at all, really.
87) 0) text: Melvin watches Simon struggle to unpack his especially  neat suitcase. Melvin is uncomfortable.
87) 3) dialog: Melvin... 
87) 5) dialog: You consider your life easy.
88) 3) dialog: I can't, I'm exhausted. Carol walks to Simon and puts an arm on him. Melvin is  visibly disturbed by her gesture.
88) 6) dialog: No... Nervous. It would be very  rough, Carol, if you weren't  along.
96) 54) text: There are lots of reason... I had  a thought that if you had sex with  Simon it might... 
96) 56) text: Sex with Simon?
97) 4) text: We are sorry to be unable to take  your call right now. Please leave  a message and we'd appreciate your  including the time/date and  purpose of your call. (Simon mouths the  word "date," then  Betty speaks before  the beep Bye-bye.
97) 5) dialog: Ah, this is Simon... I'm here in  town...  (he waits)
99) 1) dialog: Hello... Hello??? Carol thrusts open the door and enters... 
99) 2) dialog: Was this supposed to be your room?
99) 4) dialog: Can you not be violent?
99) 6) dialog: (emphatically)
99) 9) dialog: Uh-huh... 
99) 11) dialog: Well, considering everything's  horrible and tomorrow I have to  face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of  thoughts.
99) 13) dialog: How to die, mostly.
99) 15) dialog: (turning off the light)
99) 18) text: Carol sitting at tub's edge -- a towel around her and now as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair -- the towel falls -- a better than perfect breast  exposed... 
99) 20) dialog: (a whisper)
99) 23) dialog: I've got to sketch you.
99) 25) dialog: I haven't even been thinking about  sketching for weeks.
99) 27) dialog: But you're beautiful... your skin  glows.
99) 29) dialog: That long neck -- the line of  you... you're porcelain... your  back goes on forever. You're  classic... you're why cavemen  chiseled on walls... 
101) 0) dialog: He's excited -- smiling... We hear Carol -- also revved.
101) 2) text: Carol holding a pose for Simon... He is holding a  ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter. His  style cramped by his cast.
101) 3) dialog: No. No. This is great, this is  so great. I can't get the angle  with this cast. He struggles with the cast, and then decides to struggle  no more. Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece  from the cast, freeing his hand -- he roars ironically -- a lion's roar of liberation. He is back at his center.
102) 0) text: Melvin is having a room service breakfast. The door opens... Simon enters. A new Simon -- better  than ever, clearly happy -- a morning-after glow.
102) 6) dialog: I just love her. (beat)
103) 0) text: Simon finishes dialing the phone... a brief wait, then:
103) 1) dialog: Hello, hi, Mom -- I can barely  hear you. Do you have to whisper?  No -- don't apologize -- it was  the luckiest thing for all of us  that you didn't answer last  night... I can't hear you... okay,  dear, just listen to me then.
103) 4) dialog: ... so Mom. Truly no grudges --  truly. A little odd that you  didn't come to see me when you  heard I was hurt, but the  important thing I want you to know  is your son is happy. I'm working  again. I'll make do -- I don't  want a thing. Wouldn't take it if  it was offered. I'll drop you a  note from wherever I land and then  it's up to you. I hope we patch  things up but know that if we  don't, I wish you both the very  best... I can't hear you. You  heard me, though, right? Good --  take good care. 'Bye. He hangs up, totally satisfied with himself and rips over to Carol and Melvin.
103) 6) dialog: I'm going back with you.
103) 8) dialog: I'll take care of myself --
103) 10) dialog: I know. I'm a little bit nervous.  Suddenly everything seems so easy.  Carol, a load has been lifted.
103) 12) dialog: You think you're kidding. Melvin stalks out.
104) 2) text: Aww Jesus! No choice. Carol walks up to Simon in the car.
104) 11) dialog: Another place where?
105) 7) dialog: (hugging her)
107) 2) dialog: Look, I've got to get a hold of  Frank and see where I'm hanging my  hat 'cause...  The door opens, revealing them:
107) 4) dialog: What are you talking about? The dog vaults toward them -- all else forgotten as the  dog greets his two favorite people and they talk to him.
107) 5) dialog: (to Verdell)
107) 7) dialog: Sorry... You're fun to mess with.
107) 8) text: Melvin gets up... Simon notices some of his paintings.
107) 10) text: There's this extra room -- I  never use. It gets good light.  No other answer really. Simon follows.
108) 1) dialog: Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm  me.
108) 3) dialog: I love you. Melvin looks at him finally -- pretensions fall.
110) 0) text: Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart... each around 1:55 a.m... He sits in a chair still fully  dressed... forlorn... Verdell in his lap. A beat then we  hear Simon's whispered voice.
110) 1) dialog: Where is my big hairy boy? Melvin is alarmed. He stops breathing as his gay housegue approaches.
110) 2) dialog: Verdell, sweeties? Melvin breathes again. Simon enters the room.
110) 3) dialog: Sorry, didn't know you were awake.  I just thought Verdell shouldn't  get too used to sleeping in here  'cause then... 
110) 5) dialog: Should I get it? Melvin nods. Simon walks into the next room... several  beats as he finds the phone. We hear him pick it up and:
110) 6) dialog: Hello.
110) 8) dialog: (into phone)
111) 1) dialog: It's Carol. Melvin is quickly out of his chair -- the dog in one  mitt... he thrusts it at Simon.
111) 3) dialog: Good luck.
113) 2) dialog: I'm coming. We enters the room carrying Verdell who strains to be  allowed closer to Melvin. Simon releases him.
113) 3) dialog: What did she say?
113) 7) dialog: Because...  (gently)
113) 11) dialog: Okay... you tell me why -- (mimics him)
113) 15) dialog: Did you like it that much?
113) 18) dialog: (getting pissed)
113) 21) dialog: But you know where you're lucky?
113) 23) dialog: You know who you want. I'll take  your seat any day. So do  something... don't sleep on it...  go over there. I don't think  anybody should ever sleep on  anything -- it's not always good  to let things calm down.
113) 25) dialog: Then get in your jammies and I'll  read you a story... I think you've  got a chance. The only real enemy  you have is her ability to think  logically -- the best thing you  have going for you is your  willingness to humiliate yourself  if it gives you one chance in  whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
113) 27) dialog: What's wrong?
