And so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed  the sex into something more intimate -- and, talk about  egg in your beer, hotter.

I let him  go out last night when it was so  cool without an overshirt -- just  and underone with just the straps  and I know better...  and I let him  talk me into it. He was whining  and...  you don't need this. Give  me a second to catch hold. And so she does. Wow does she... and gives us some  notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it  takes to subdue it as Dr. Bettes keeps reassuring her and she keeps nodding... finally a deep breath as Spencer  enters from the bathroom.
