2) 10) text: Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall. MELVIN (not missing a beat)
2) 13) dialog: (overlapping)
2) 18) text: Do you still think I was  exaggerating? FRANK can only smile.
2) 19) dialog: Definitely a package you don't  want to open or touch.
5) 4) text: He always liked me. As Simon goes past him to take the dog from the  Handyman... JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a  laugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As  the others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside.  Jackie lingers, looking on affectionately as Simon picks  some awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body... he puts  Verdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS in protest.
7) 17) dialog: Won't worry about it. You go  ahead. Frank waits till Simon EXITS SCENE and then knocks loudly on Melvin's door. There is a sharp change in his demeanor
7) 20) dialog: You may think you can intimidate  the whole world with your  attitude, but I grew up in Hell.  My grandmother had more attitude.  You don't intimidate me.
7) 22) text: Police! Police! Fucking crooked  police...  doughnut-munching morons  help me! (to Frank)
7) 24) dialog: Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like  him enough to batter you  unrecognizable if you verbally  abuse him or so much as touch his  dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try  and think how you can make this up  to him. (suddenly loud)
7) 26) text: Have a nice day. Party! He tosses Melvin back and walks out. Melvin straightens  his shirt as he steps out into the hall. Frank smiles as  he re-enters the other apartment. Melvin appears  impressed.
22) 3) dialog: So I've got to get to the  hospital. If you could take the  dog just for tonight.
22) 5) dialog: Maybe if you kept locked in  the bathroom. No? Okay. Thanks. (as he turns away and she  closes the door he adds)
22) 6) text: Old bitch...  Damn dog. A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed  and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings...  VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches  his mugger:
22) 7) dialog: You're taking him...  yes...  you're  taking him -- this will clear the  books. One night. You want to  say "no" to me? Try...  because  I've never felt as nuts as I do  right this second. I almost want  you to try saying "no."
22) 10) dialog: Thanks for looking after him. Frank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and  places Verdell inside.
23) 0) text: MUSIC IN: as Frank pulls the door partially closed to  block Verdell's escape. The music represents Verdell's state of mind -- trapped  in the apartment of the man who tried to kill him. We  STAY with the dog during the O.S. dialogue: As his head  turns in panic we see his various POVs as the dialogue  continues O.S.
23) 4) dialog: (threatening)
27) 0) text: Frank on the phone.
27) 1) dialog: (into phone)
27) 4) dialog: I'll meet you in there.
28) 4) dialog: Hey, hey...  (as he sees him)
28) 11) dialog: (sheepish)
28) 15) dialog: No, I promise...  not a chance. I  own this guy. There was no one  else. I'm on the move too much.  Trust me.
28) 17) dialog: Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon. Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery,  then he takes a breath -- like someone about to dive  underwater. First a small, mumbled pep talk to himself.
34) 0) text: Frank knocking on Melvin's door. He opens it.
34) 1) dialog: How's Verdell doing?
34) 3) dialog: Simon's home. I was sort of  hoping you could keep the dog  until he's had a chance to think  and adjust... 
34) 6) dialog: No. He wants him back. He'll be  by tomorrow.
34) 8) text: Okay by me. Frank exits.
50) 4) text: Frank's idea. He thought I should  have notes so I did this right...  maintained focus, didn't get  emotional and tried not to terrify  you.
60) 9) text: But you know, you know -- you  didn't even ask how much, Carl?  Well, Frank has no right to  discuss how much I'm in hock...  no, you're right -- not the point.  So...  what have you been up to???  Uh-huh... Oh, the group show...   how was it? Well, I'm not  surprised that there's that much  talent around...  great...  Look --  gotta go...  no, you shouldn't feel  that way at all...  take care, you,  too...  you, too...  Good-bye. (as he hangs up)
73) 5) text: Can you believe he's eating with  someone. ON MELVIN &amp; FRANK
73) 7) dialog: Sure -- take him to the vet.
73) 9) dialog: Do it.
73) 14) dialog: She's nice.
73) 17) dialog: It looks like it really went over.  You're sure making the rounds.  Simon says you brought him soup  last night. I hope he doesn't  write you a note. Melvin looks up -- wary -- his brain sends a disturbing  message.
73) 18) dialog: What?
73) 20) dialog: Hey -- you called me... I... 
73) 22) dialog: Yeah, but it's all about Simon  now... you helped with the dog...  And now there are other things.  I'm just as concerned as you are  about Simon.
73) 24) dialog: It's not only financial  assistance. What he's got to do  is go to Baltimore tomorrow and  ask his parents for money. It's  not going to happen on the phone.
73) 26) dialog: Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high  maintenance selling painter coming  through... So I'm out. Can you  take him?
73) 28) dialog: Take my car -- a convertible. Do  you drive?
73) 37) dialog: If there's some mental health  foundation that raises money to  help people like you be sure to  let me know.
81) 3) text: He is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the  tussle Frank and Simon are having just inside the  building.
81) 4) dialog: I'm sorry that I'm not taking  you.
81) 6) text: So am I, Frank. Frank starts to leave -- Simon stops him. They embrace.
104) 10) text: Well, your luck is holding. They  sublet your place. You're  homeless. Frank's got a line on  another place you can use for now.
