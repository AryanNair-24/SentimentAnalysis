Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk, focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE begins to RING. Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, its  TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates. Trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the telephone booth as if taking aim. Gritting through the pain, she races the truck -- Slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly bright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as -- She answers the phone. There is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking  mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk -- Barreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick wall, smashing it to Plexiglas pulp. After a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of the garbage truck.  Agent Smith inspects the wreckage. There is no body.  Trinity is gone. His jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration. AGENT JONES walks up behind him.

18) 14) dialog: My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you, but I believe you want to do the right thing.  It is obvious that you are an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson, and that you are interested in the future.  That is why I believe you are ready to put your past mistakes behind you and get on with your life.
18) 16) dialog: We are willing to wipe the slate clean, to give you a fresh start and all we are asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.

The cops lunge at him but every part of his body is a deadly weapon moving with impossible speed.

149) 1) dialog: Have you ever stood and stared at it, Morpheus?  Marveled at its beauty.  Its genius.  Billions of people just living out their  lives... oblivious.
149) 3) dialog: Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world?  Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy.  It was a disaster.  No one would accept the program.  Entire crops were lost.

149) 7) dialog: The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.  Which is why the Matrix was re-designed to this:  the peak of your civilization.
149) 9) dialog: I say 'your civilization' because as soon as we start thinking for you, it really becomes our civilization, which is, of course, what this is all about.

151) 1) dialog: I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species.  I've realized that you are not actually mammals.
151) 3) dialog: Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment.  But you humans do not.  You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area.
151) 5) dialog: There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.  Do you know what it is? A virus.

158) 1) dialog: Can you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm going to be honest with you.
158) 3) dialog: I hate this place.  This zoo. This prison.  This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer.  It's the smell, if there is such a thing.  I feel saturated by it.  I can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it.
158) 5) dialog: Repulsive, isn't it?
158) 7) dialog: I must get out of here, I must get free.  In this mind is tlie key. My key.

Agent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back, blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light -- Then Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls. And finally Agent Jones. Neo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action.
173) 0) text: Morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain.  His eyes, still white, begin to blink, twitch, then close. And when he opens them, they are again dark and flashing with fire. The Agents knife into the room, FIRING even as Neo's BULLET TRAILS chase them. Morpheus strains at his handcuffs. The Agents and the marines turn the tide, BLASTING LEAD, RICOCHETING, POCK-MARKING the COPTER. FIRING wildly, Neo turns to see Morpheus rising, snapping the handcuffs, starting for the window. Agent Smith stops and sees Morpheus run past the open bedroom door.
173) 1) dialog: Nooo!
173) 6) text: Trinity is already pulling the copter up and away. As Agent Smith grabs the M-16 from the nearest marine. He'll bring them all down.

She hears him SCREAM and sees Agent Smith emerge as if formed by congealing darkness, charging with a fistful of metal. The GUN FIRES, the BULLET flying at her, BURSTING through the plastic WINDOW just as -- Trinity disappears. The handset hanging in the air as the BULLET HITS, SHATTERING the EAR-PIECE.
182) 0) text: GUN REPORT THUNDERS through the underground, both men BLASTING, moving at impossible speed. For a blinking noment we enter BULLET-TIME. Gun flash tongues curl from Neols gun, bullets float forward like a plane noving across the sky, cartridges cartwheel into space. An instant later they are nearly on top of each other, rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored reflection of the other -- Each jamming their gun tight to the other's head. They freeze in a kind of embrace; Neo sweating, panting, Agent Smith machine-calm. Agent Smith smiles.
182) 1) dialog: You're empty.
182) 4) text: The smile falls.  Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER. CLICK. Agent Smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fist flying at furious speed, blows and counters, Neo retreating as -- A knife-hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him slamming back against a steel column. Stunned, he ducks just under a punch that crunches into the beam, STEEL CHUNKS EXPLODING like shrapnel. Behind him, Neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck- snapping reverse round-house.  Agent Smith's glasses fly off and he glares at Neo; his eyes, ice blue.
182) 5) dialog: You can't win.
182) 7) text: He attacks with a vicious series of blows but the Agent seems to absorb them, waiting for his opening. And this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.
184) 0) text: Agent Smith grabs hold of him, lifting him into the air, hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel, where he falls inches from the electrified third-rail. The Agent is about to jump down, and press his attack when he hears sonething.  From deep in the tunnel, like an animal cry; a burst of high-speed METAL GRINDING against METAL. The sound of an ON-COMING TRAIN.
187) 0) text: Neo tries to get up.  Agent Smith jumps down onto the tracks and drop-kicks him in the face. The world begins to shake, RUMBLING as the TRAIN NEARS.
187) 1) dialog: Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?
187) 2) text: Agent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold, forcing him to look down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a hole in the darkness.
187) 3) dialog: That is the sound of inevitability.
187) 5) dialog: It is the sound of your death.

187) 10) text: Impossibly, he hurls himself straight up, smashing Smith against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel. They fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES INTO the station. Neo back-flips up off the tracks just as -- The train barrels over Agent Smith. Neo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its emergency brake.  With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of TORTURED RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the station. Neo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the escalator -- As the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last car open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his glasses again intact.
189) 0) text: A man sits in his Mercedes, talking on his car phone when his door is thrown open.  Neo yanks him out and jumps in. Further down the street, Agent Smith slows, calmly touching his ear-piece. Neo throws the car across traffic, rocketing down a side- street.
194) 7) text: Neo drops the phone as his car bucks into the opposing lane -- Directly into the charging path of an enormous truck driven by Agent Smith. Neo dives from the Mercedes as the truck plows into it, rending metal and GLASS, crushing through, totaling other cars, as it EXPLODES. Neo is up and running even as orange and black clouds billow up behind hin.
203) 0) text: Three holes in his chest, Neo falls to the blue shag carpeting, blood smearing down the wallpaper. Agent Smith stands over him, still aiming, taking no chances.
