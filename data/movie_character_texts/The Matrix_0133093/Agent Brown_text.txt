7) 0) text: On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit. Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her  moverents so clean, gliding in and out of each jump, contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops. Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace. The METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity  turns to it, racing for the back of the building. The edge falls away into a wide back alley.  The next  building is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is  perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other  roof. The cops slow, realizing they are about to see something  ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself  into the air. From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she  hangs in flight Then hitting, somersaulting up, still running hard.
7) 2) text: They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the  move exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder, up onto  one knee. Just below the building are the runbling tracks of  riveted steel.  The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a  rattling blur of gray metal.  Trinity junps, landing easily. She looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air  barely reaching the last car Agent Brown stands, yanking out a gun. Trinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head. Ahead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point  where the train has begun to turn, there is -- A window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick building. Trinity zeroes in on it, running as hard as she can, her  speed compounded by the train.  The SCREAM of the STEEL  rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into th turn. Trinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body  leveling into a dive.  She falls, arms covering her head as -- The whole world seems to spin on its axis -- And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down stairs bleeding, broken -- But still alive. Through the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown, still on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the wind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train  slides him past the window. Trinity tries to move.  Everything hurts.
