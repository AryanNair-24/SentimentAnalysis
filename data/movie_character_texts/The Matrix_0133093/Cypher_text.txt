27) 58) text: Cypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone away from, Neo.
27) 59) dialog: Morpheus, I know what you believe but I think this is a mistake. We're rushing him.  He's old.  I'm afraid he might pop.
27) 82) text: Cypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent data.  Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs. Neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers disappear beneath the rippling surface. Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy stuck to his fingertips.
27) 98) dialog: I knew it, I knew it...

54) 5) dialog: Midnight watch.
54) 8) dialog: The Matrix?  Yeah.
54) 10) dialog: You want a drink?
54) 12) dialog: I'll tell you, I feel for you, man.  I really do.  Most of us were still young, just punks, when Morpheus jacked us.  But you, you had a real life.
54) 13) text: Neo takes a sip and it almost kills him.  Cypher pounds on his back.
54) 14) dialog: Good shit, huh?  Dozer makes it. It's good for two things: degreasing engines and killing brain cells.
54) 16) dialog: Did he tell you why he did it?
54) 18) dialog: I'll be the didn't tell you that this wasn't the first time he thought he found the One.
54) 19) text: Neo shakes his head as Cypher fills his cup and laughs.
54) 20) dialog: Let me give you a piece of advice. Between you and me, if Morpheus says you can fly, I wouldn't go jumping out any windows to find out if he's right.  Understand?
54) 21) text: Cypher raises his drink.  Neo swallows another throat- scorching mouthful.
54) 22) dialog: Welcome to the real world!

55) 3) dialog: The real world.  Ha, what a joke.
55) 5) dialog: You know what real is?  I'll tell you what real is.
55) 6) text: A fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the face of Cypher.
55) 7) dialog: Real is just another four-letter word.
55) 8) text: He laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth. The restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago skyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu has no prices. Sitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith.
55) 10) text: Cypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his teeth.
55) 11) dialog: Mmm, so, so fucking good.
55) 13) dialog: You know, I know that this steak doesn't exist.  I know when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious.  After nine years, do you know what I've realized?
55) 15) dialog: Ignorance is bliss.
55) 17) dialog: I don't want to remember nothing. Nothing!  You understand?  And I want to be rich.  Someone important.  Like an actor.  You can do that, right?
55) 19) text: Cypher takes a deep drink of wine.
55) 20) dialog: All right.  You get my body back in a power plant, reinsert me into the Matrix and I'll get you what you want.
55) 22) dialog: I told you, I don't know them. But I can give you the man who does.
60) 5) text: Cypher and Trinity move away from them, securing the perimeter.  As Cypher passes a garbage can, he surreptitiously drops something inside. It is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as the LINE CONNECTS. An early 1970s, black Lincoln Continental emerges from a corrugated roll-up garage.  Morpheus and Neo get in.
70) 0) text: Storm clouds shroud the streets as the sky turns jaundice. Cypher nervously glances down the surrounding streets. He notices several unmarked white vans. He mops the sweat from his forehead, when Trinity sees the black Lincoln.
71) 0) text: In the hovercraft, we see the sweat rolling down Cypher's face and neck. Tank is typing rapidly at the keyboard.
90) 1) dialog: That's what they changed.  We're trapped.  There's no way out.
103) 0) text: Cypher has slipped and is wedged between the wall and several thick supply pipes.
105) 0) text: Neo pulls Cypher free just as the Cop OPENS FIRE -- BULLETS PUNCHING shafts of light like swords into the box of soot-black space.
110) 0) text: This part of the basement, a dark concrete cavern, was the main mechanical room.  There are four enormous boilers, dinosaur-like technology that once pumped hot water like arteries. Black and bloody, they squeeze out from the ceiling into the tangled web of pipes. Their enemies are waiting for them. Blinding lights cut open the darkness as gas-masked figures FIRE GRENADE LAUNCHERS. Smoke blossoms from the green-metal canisters. Morpheus never stops moving.  Searching the floor, he finds what.he needs; the cover of the catch basin. Cypher watches him pry open the grate, when a gas can bounces near him.
110) 2) text: Cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him.
111) 0) text: Cypher's body begins to shiver uncontrollably.

115) 0) text: Cypher is carried out, hand-cuffed, his body still shaking, mucus bubbling out his nose.  As he is led past Agent Smith, it almost seems that both men smile.
123) 4) dialog: I need an exit!  Fast!
124) 0) text: Cypher is standing at a public phone.  Across the street is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided witli an oncoming car.
124) 1) dialog: There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  They're all dead.  I still got the shakes but, Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
125) 3) dialog: Just get me outta here.
126) 2) text: Cypher hangs up and smiles as the fire trucks arrive.
126) 3) dialog: An actor.  Definitely.
129) 0) text: Running, Cypher turns onto Erie.
130) 0) text: Dead machines, eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on metal shelves like bodies in a morgue. Plywood covering a small window is ripped off and Cypher crawls inside. Deep in the back room, a PHONE that has not rung in years begins to RING.
131) 2) text: Cypher's body twitches in its harness, jerking itself awake.  His eyes blink open.  Dozer unplugs him.
131) 4) text: Cypher stands, a raspy cough spewing from his lungs.
133) 0) text: Cypher holds his chest.
133) 2) dialog: Goddamn gas.  My lungs are killing me.

133) 6) text: As Dozer stoops for a cabinet, Cypher pulls back a heavy blanket exposing a plasma rifle.
134) 0) text: Neo crawls through the window that Cypher opened.

137) 0) text: Dozer rolls up, grabbing a heavy crowbar from a box of tools. Cypher circles the drive chairs as the sights of the plasma rifle find Dozer's face. Dozer charges, screaming, and the PLASMA RIFLE SCREAMS back.
139) 0) text: The operator PHONE begins to RING- Cypher steps over the body of Tank and looks at the monitor.
140) 1) dialog: Hello, Trinity.
140) 3) dialog: He had an accident.
141) 1) dialog: You know, for a long time, I thought I was in love with you, Trinity.  I used to dream about you...
141) 3) dialog: You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
141) 8) text: Wearing Tank's operator headgear, Cypher moves among the silent bodies.
141) 9) dialog: In a way you're very lucky.  Most people never know why they die. One minute they're alive, the next they're dead.  No warning. Nothing.  That's why I thought maybe I should tell you.  It seemed the least I could do.
141) 11) dialog: You see, the truth, the real,truth is that the war is over.  It's been over for a long time.  And guess what?  We lost!  Did you hear that?  We lost the war!
141) 13) dialog: Zion?  Zion is a part of this delusion.  More of this madness. That's why this has to be done. It has to end.  Now and forever.
141) 16) text: Cypher walks away from Morpheus and bends down next to Apoc's body.
141) 17) dialog: You see, Trinity, we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here.  It's in the Matrix.
141) 19) dialog: Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die.
141) 21) dialog: You tell me which is more real.
141) 23) dialog: Welcome to the real world, right?
141) 26) dialog: Pay for it?  I'm not even going to remember it.  It'll be like it never happened.  The tree falling in the forest.  It doesn't make a sound.
141) 29) dialog: Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove that the message is true.
141) 31) dialog: If Morpheus was right, then there's no way I can pull this plug, is there?
141) 33) dialog: If he is the One, then in the next few seconds there has to be some kind of miracle to stop me. Because if he dies like the others that means Morpheus was wrong. How can he be the One if he's dead?
141) 34) text: He takes hold of the cord when -- She hears an EXPLOSION and a scream. Cypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the knee.  He rolls over and finds Tank on the ground, and the sights of the plasma rifle.
