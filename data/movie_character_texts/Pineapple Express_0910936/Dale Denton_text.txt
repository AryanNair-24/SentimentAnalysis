I'm not asking for free beer                Tuesday's or anything. And the whole city              would be more aesthetically pleasing and               smell better. And don't pretend you can't              smell it. Ever been to New York? Great                 place, smells like piss, though.                       (takes a hit and starts                         coughing)                                      Twice a week,  cough  might fix that.

13) 17) dialog: Sure.

14) 9) dialog: Of course. I know that. It's                        just...tomorrow's tight. I've got a whole           bunch of cases that I can finish                    tomorrow. It's probably going to take me            into the night.                                    
14) 16) dialog: I will. I promise. I'm not trying to                   avoid this, for real, I've just been                   crazy busy.

14) 31) dialog: 
14) 37) text: Dale doesn't know what to make of Mr. Edwards comments and looks.
14) 41) dialog: Dude, you may be a teacher here, but                   we're about the same age, so don't get                 all high and mighty. It's not that weird.              Frankly, it's natural.

15) 13) text: They share a long kiss, and Angie gets out of the car. Dale watches her walk away, then whips out his cell phone and hits speed dial.
15) 20) dialog: Yo. It's Dale. Mind if I come by and pick up some shit?
16) 1) text: SAUL SILVER is constructing a CROSS-SHAPED JOINT (two joints that intersect one another). Pot and paraphernalia are scattered all over the coffee table. A large "Scarface" movie poster hangs on the wall. There is a knock at the door and Dale enters.

16) 27) dialog: Better than that Blue Oyster weed?

16) 42) text: Saul walks into another room. Dale looks around anxiously; he clearly wants to go.

16) 50) dialog: Where's the scale?
16) 56) text: Dale checks his watch and then looks at the door; suddenly, something catches his eye - it's the cross- joint Saul was constructing.
16) 58) dialog: Holy shit! What the fuck is this thing?
16) 64) dialog: You can actually smoke that contraption?
16) 65) text: Saul puts Dale's weed in a baggie.

16) 73) dialog: Well, be careful with that thing.

16) 82) dialog: (excited) Wow. So like, uh...so like, so like what do I do?

16) 88) dialog: Holy...
16) 89) text: Dale takes the joint and hits it, exploding into a coughing fit.
16) 96) text: Saul takes a toke. Dale coughs HARDER and HARDER. He seems like he might throw up.
16) 99) text: Saul passes Dale the joint, obliviously dropping ash all over his suit. Slightly agitated, Dale brushes it off.

16) 113) text: Dale takes a big hit from the joint.
16) 115) dialog: Well...uh, I got a totally useless degree two years ago, then I did nothing for a year, then my dad got so fed up he hooked me up.                                               
16) 121) dialog: I got it pretty sweet, though. Today? I             smoked like five joints, gave out some              pieces of paper, and I ate some Burger              King-
16) 124) text: Dale passes the join to Saul.
16) 126) dialog: Yeah man. I'd get on that shit. They're fucking mind blowing. So, then I hot-               boxed my car and then...got some action             from my girlfriend.                                
16) 131) dialog: A little. She's in high school.                    
16) 135) dialog: No, no. She's 19.                                  
16) 139) dialog: Yeah, it's awesome, although I think                she's getting old enough where she's                realizing I don't do much. And these high           school guys these days. They're all                 roided out and going to Harvard. Even on            my best days, I look like a fat, dumb               piece of shit next to them.                        
16) 146) dialog: Dude...you've got, like, the actual                  easiest job in the world.                           
16) 150) dialog: You can actually do whatever the hell you            want. You get to sleep all day and people            come buy weed at night.

16) 173) text: Saul points to his Scarface poster. The joint ends. After a few moments it seems as though their ability to have a conversation burnt out with the joint. They sit in awkward silence. Dale gets up.
16) 175) dialog: Well Saul, that was crazy. Thanks.
16) 178) text: They slap each other five and Dale exits. Saul turns on the TV. Saved By the Bell is on. It makes Saul chuckle.

17) 6) text: Fortunately,   the COP crosses the street and walks towar Ted's house.   Confused, Dale watches as she is let in. Dale waits a   moment and then re-lights the joint. He tries to see   into Ted's house as he takes a MASSIVE TOK
17) 7) text: BANG! A SILENCE SHATTERING BLAST comes from Ted's house. Dale holds the toke in and tries to keep quiet as he focuses on the large front window. SUDDENLY, the drapes are torn down by an ASIAN MAN as he falls forwards and crashes through the front window!
17) 8) text: Dale watches in horror as a LARGE GREY-HAIRED MAN and the Female Cop step forward and shoot the Asian man! BLAM! BLAM! Blood splatters!

17) 13) text: The Grey-Haired Man and the Female Cop sprint out of the house in time to see Dale's distant tail lights vanish into the darkness. Something catches the Grey-Haired Man's eye - a trail of smoke rising from the grass. He lowers his blood-stained hand and picks up...DALE'S ROACH! He brings it to his nose and sniffs, then rips open the paper and examines the weed closely.

18) 29) dialog: He fucking killed him, man!
18) 33) dialog: (quietly) He killed him!
18) 37) dialog: Yeah, man! I can't believe it. A cop! A lady, and a guy.
18) 41) dialog: No! A guy!
18) 45) dialog: No! A cop and a guy killed   another guy! The lady and the guy...No,   a fucking woman, a police woman, and   an old guy, shot a guy, a younger guy,   in the fucking window at Ted's house!
18) 49) dialog: Which guy?
18) 56) dialog: I don't fucking know. He was this big, old, grey haired guy with a gun, and he fucking took him, and he shot him! Right there in the fucking window! BAM!
18) 60) dialog: And they saw me! They saw me see them shoot the guy!
18) 68) dialog: No! I panicked. I was having a coughing fit, I crashed, I crashed into a car. Fuck, two cars. They must've heard at least. They knew someone was there.
18) 72) dialog: No. I don't think so. No.
18) 75) text: Dale shakes his head, on the verge of tears. Saul shrugs, sits back down, then picks up his joint and re-lites it.
18) 82) dialog: I'm not calling the cops - one of them was a cop. They could all be cops!                   
18) 86) dialog: Yeah. I saw some blood.
18) 90) dialog: I don't know, who do drug dealers kill? It was probably another drug dealer. He was Asian. Are there Asian drug dealers.

18) 110) dialog: This weed is actually that rare?
18) 114) dialog: So, you are actually the only guy in town with this weed?
18) 118) dialog: And am I the only guy you gave it to?
18) 122) dialog: But, like, another dealer, couldn't identify it, the pineapple weed? Like, if they found a roach of it, right?
18) 127) dialog: (panicking) We should go, we shouldn't be here! We should go!
18) 131) dialog: I left a roach of this weed in front of Ted's house!
18) 138) dialog: No, listen - they could find the roach and say, "This is pineapple weed, Saul's the only guy in town who has pineapple weed, therefore he must have witnessed the murder or know who did - let's go kill him."
18) 145) text: Dale grabs Saul and stops him.
18) 147) dialog: Wait!
18) 151) dialog: Saul, wait! Grab anything we might need, like your weed and money and stuff.

19) 14) dialog: Go back! Go back!
19) 15) text: They DASH back to the elevator. Dale shoves his arm between the doors and they hop in. Saul rapidly presses the LOBBY button as the doors shut. They're both on the verge of hyperventilating.
19) 17) dialog: Okay, man. We gotta try to relax.
19) 21) dialog: We don't want to draw attention.
19) 25) dialog: I don't know! Who knows? Just try to be cool.
19) 33) dialog: That was bad - Calm! Calm! Calm!
19) 39) dialog: Oh. Pardon.

21) 26) dialog: Uh...nine bucks.
21) 30) dialog: Fine. Forget the hotel.
21) 35) dialog: Okay...where's nowhere?
22) 1) text: The car is parked on a small dirt path in the moon-lit woods. Dale paces back and forth as Saul walks over.
