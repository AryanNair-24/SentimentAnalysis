15) 15) dialog: (over phone) Yo?
16) 1) text: SAUL SILVER is constructing a CROSS-SHAPED JOINT (two joints that intersect one another). Pot and paraphernalia are scattered all over the coffee table. A large "Scarface" movie poster hangs on the wall. There is a knock at the door and Dale enters.
16) 5) dialog: (unpleasantly surprised) What the fuck?!?
16) 9) dialog: I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did you get in here?
16) 13) dialog: That's fucked up, man! This building is filled with fuckin' assholes. What else is the buzzer for? Fuck.
16) 17) dialog: Hey, stuff your sorry's i n a sack, bro.            We're always cool. It's those fuckin' jaggoffs.
16) 25) dialog: Brass tacs. I've got this new bud. Unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but fortunately, it's hands down the dopest fuckin' shit I ever smoked. And I've smoked some dope fuckin' shit.
16) 29) dialog: Dude. Seriously. It's like if that Blue Oyster shit and the Afghan Kush I got had a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest Northern Lights and that red-ass Espresso Snowflake had a baby, and then by some miracle those babies met, and fucked - then this would be the shit they'd birth.
16) 30) text: Saul pulls out a big bag of weed. He places it on the coffee table as though it was his child. He pulls out a large bud.
16) 32) dialog: Smell it.
16) 37) dialog: It's called Pineapple Express. My guy Red told me it's when this Hawaiian flood takes special dirt to the weed or some shit. It's pretty scientific. And I'm the only guy in the whole city who has it. And, its only ten bones more for a quarter.
16) 41) dialog: No doubt. Just let me grab my scale.
16) 42) text: Saul walks into another room. Dale looks around anxiously; he clearly wants to go.
16) 46) text: A moment later, Saul comes back into the room and sits down. Dale notices that he didn't bring anything back from the other room. Saul notices Dale looking at him strangely.
16) 48) dialog: What's with the look? What?
16) 52) dialog: Oh shit! The scale. Be right back.
16) 53) text: Saul hustles into the other room.
16) 55) dialog: (from other room) You know what's weird? How sometimes, your brain just chooses to like, not keep things in it, you know? (beat) Fucking scale. (beat) Shit. Where is it?
16) 56) text: Dale checks his watch and then looks at the door; suddenly, something catches his eye - it's the cross- joint Saul was constructing.
16) 59) text: Saul comes back in and puts a small electronic scale on the coffee table.
16) 61) dialog: (nonchalantly) Ah, the cross-joint. You've never seen one of these? Not surprising. They are, like, the apex of the vortex of joint engineering. NASA built the first one in               the eighties.                                         
16) 62) text: Saul chuckles at his joke as he places some weed on the scale.
16) 65) text: Saul puts Dale's weed in a baggie.
16) 70) dialog: You light all three ends at the same time, then, you smoke it as it resonates the main section, creating a "trifecta" of smoking power. It's like, three times as powerful as a normal joint.
16) 71) text: Dale hands Saul some money and Saul gives him his weed. Dale lingers for a moment.
16) 76) dialog: Dude...you wanna smoke this thing with me?
16) 79) dialog: I can't even light it on my own.
16) 83) text: Saul gathers three lighters from the coffee table.
16) 85) dialog: Alright. Firstly you light these two ends. Then I will light the tip, making the trifecta complete. Are you ready?
16) 86) text: Dale nods and they light the joint. Saul tokes hard; plumes of smoke fill the air as he bursts into a COUGHING FIT.
16) 91) dialog: It's...uh, it's good to cough.  COUGH  It opens the  COUGH  capillaries...gets you twenty-five percent higher.
16) 95) dialog: And that, combined with the pineapple weed, and the cross-joint  COUGH  you're a good thirty to forty times higher. I don't know the exact math, but, pff, you're pretty fucking gong-showed. You know what I mean?
16) 96) text: Saul takes a toke. Dale coughs HARDER and HARDER. He seems like he might throw up.
16) 98) dialog: It's crazy. The better the weed, the more I wish I could think of how to explain what's so good about it, but the...uh, the better it is, the less shit I can think of in total, you know?                         
16) 99) text: Saul passes Dale the joint, obliviously dropping ash all over his suit. Slightly agitated, Dale brushes it off.
16) 101) dialog: Okay, so, like, you've been buying from me for, like, a few months now and I really gotta ask. (beat) What's with the suit?
16) 105) dialog: You`re a servant? Like, a butler.
16) 108) text: Saul looks confused.
16) 112) dialog: Nice, man. Where'd you get that job?
16) 123) dialog: Hey man, did you get those new chicken fries?
16) 124) text: Dale passes the join to Saul.
16) 127) text: Saul laughs at this.
16) 129) dialog: Does she smoke pot?
16) 133) dialog: That's fuckin' sweet! Ilegal love! You're           like Jerry Lee Lewis. I just read his               biography.                                         
16) 137) dialog: (dissappointed)                              Oh. It's still cool I guess.                       
16) 141) dialog: Whatever, man. It sounds like you got it            pretty good. I wish I had a job that                easy. Fuck.                                        
16) 148) dialog: Hey! You're right, man. I never thought              of it like that.                                    
16) 151) text: Dale passes Saul the joint.
16) 153) dialog: That's totally true. Except tomorrow.                Thanks to that bitch daylight savings, I             gotta go change my grandma's clocks forward at 7am. Or 8am. I seriously can't figure it out.
16) 156) text: Saul passes Dale the joint.
16) 158) dialog: Yo, so, like, what have these people done that you go after?
16) 165) dialog: Dude! My guy, Red, gets his weed from a Ted Jones. He's, like, #1 supplier in town. Maybe it's him!
16) 169) dialog: Yeah, but not like this one, man! He's what I want to be one day. He's like the "Jesus of Weed". So...I guess he's like Jah. Or Scarface.
16) 173) text: Saul points to his Scarface poster. The joint ends. After a few moments it seems as though their ability to have a conversation burnt out with the joint. They sit in awkward silence. Dale gets up.
16) 177) dialog: No worries dude, peace.
16) 178) text: They slap each other five and Dale exits. Saul turns on the TV. Saved By the Bell is on. It makes Saul chuckle.
18) 1) text: Saul is laying on his couch watching Saved By the Bell, laughing so hard that he's crying.
18) 3) dialog: Ha! Ha! Ha! Screech.                                  
18) 6) dialog: (mumbles) Fucking hell.
18) 9) dialog: Hello?
18) 13) text: Saul casually presses the talk button.
18) 15) dialog: (annoyingly casual) Denton? Dale Denton?
18) 19) text: Annoyed, Saul buzzes him in and unlocks the door.
18) 24) dialog: (to himself) ...fucking, don't smoke that shit if you can't handle it.
18) 27) dialog: (startled) Dude, whoa. What the fuck are-
18) 31) dialog: Be quiet, man, I got neighbors-
18) 35) dialog: (loud) Somebody killed somebody?!?
18) 39) dialog: Somebody killed a cop, a lady and a guy?
18) 43) dialog: A cop killed a guy?
18) 47) dialog: Was the guy Ted?
18) 54) dialog: I don't know, the old guy who shot the guy?
18) 58) dialog: I heard Ted's got grey hair!
18) 61) text: Saul jumps to his feet.
18) 63) dialog: What!?! They saw you?!? Why the fuck did you come here? Did they follow you?!?
18) 64) text: Saul dashes to the window and peeks out.
18) 66) dialog: Did they follow you here!?!
18) 70) dialog: But they don't know it's you?
18) 74) dialog: So...they're not coming here?
18) 75) text: Dale shakes his head, on the verge of tears. Saul shrugs, sits back down, then picks up his joint and re-lites it.
18) 77) dialog: Cool. So, what's your game-plan? You gonna call the cops? Cause if you do, I'd appreciate it if you left my shit out of this shit.
18) 84) dialog: Did you see any blood? Was it sick?
18) 88) dialog: I wonder who the guy he shot was?
18) 92) dialog: Hell yeah, man. The Koreans teamed up with, like, the Vietnamese or some shit. They're crazy mother fuckers. Number two in town. (beat) Heh. Ted's cappin' the competition. Yo, you want some of this?
18) 93) text: Saul passes Dale the joint. Dale takes the joint and frantically smokes as he paces.
18) 95) dialog: So, like, exactly what was the sequence of happenings?
18) 99) dialog: Oh, the Pineapple Express. It's so rare it's almost a shame to smoke it, like killing a unicorn...with, like, a bomb.              
18) 102) text: Dale stops pacing and stares at Saul. He then looks down at the joint of pineapple weed. Saul notices wheels turning in Dale's head.
18) 104) dialog: What?
18) 112) dialog: (proudly) Yeah, it's like, "the rarest".
18) 116) dialog: Fuckin' rights, I am. Red told me he was giving me an "exclusive sneak preview".
18) 120) dialog: Yeah. So, we're the only guys.
18) 123) text: Saul thinks for a moment.
18) 125) dialog: I could. Why?
18) 129) dialog: No...seriously, why?
18) 133) dialog: So what? I leave roaches all over fucking town.
18) 139) text: Finally, Saul understands.
18) 141) dialog: Mother of fuck!
18) 144) dialog: Let's go!
18) 145) text: Dale grabs Saul and stops him.
18) 149) dialog: Why!?! Let go of me! Let's get the fuck out of here!
18) 152) text: Saul grabs his bag of weed and shoves it in his backpack. They run for the door.
18) 156) dialog: Yes! Come on!
19) 1) text: Saul and Dale run to the elevator and frantically press the button, terrified for their lives.
19) 3) dialog: Fuck! I forgot something!
19) 4) text: Saul runs back to his apartment, leaving Dale alone and frightened. Saul BURSTS back out of his apartment holding his cell.
19) 9) dialog: Dude, I was so scared going back, I thought there was gonna be guys there, and then you'd be gone, and there was this music in my head-
19) 15) text: They DASH back to the elevator. Dale shoves his arm between the doors and they hop in. Saul rapidly presses the LOBBY button as the doors shut. They're both on the verge of hyperventilating.
19) 19) dialog: Why?!?
19) 23) dialog: (freaking out) Whose attention!?! You think they could be down there? In the Lobby? Right now!?!
19) 31) dialog: What the fuck was that?
19) 40) text: Dale and Saul quickly leave as the bikers enter the elevator.
20) 1) text: The rough looking guys, BUDLOFSKY and MATHESON, kick in Saul's door and dash into the room, guns drawn. Matheson spots a smoldering joint in the ashtray.
21) 5) dialog: What? Ted? Nothing. For all I know he's tracking us with space satellites right now! He's got grey hair, that's all I knew.
21) 6) text: Saul checks behind them.
21) 8) dialog: Let's go to your place.
21) 12) dialog: Okay, so let's got to a hotel, or a motel, or a Holiday Inn.
21) 19) dialog: All I've got is the seventy-five you gave me.
21) 23) dialog: Well, how much money do you have?
21) 24) text: While Dale gets out his wallet, Saul opens Dale's change tray. It's full of roaches.
21) 28) dialog: Well, shut up then! I've got more than you!
21) 33) dialog: I wish we could just go nowhere.
22) 1) text: The car is parked on a small dirt path in the moon-lit woods. Dale paces back and forth as Saul walks over.
22) 5) dialog: (thrilled) He couldn't. Cause I'm in the woods. It's impossible! Unless he's, like, hanging on the bottom of the car or some shit, but I             mean-
22) 12) dialog: There's no way. He could only find out from Red.
22) 16) dialog: Red's pretty much a middleman between Ted and guys like me. And we're mad fucking tight. One time he convinced some girl he knew to give me a hand-job within, like, five minutes of me meeting her.
22) 20) dialog: Fuck that. That's bullshit. He would have called me if that happened. A hand-job, Dale! Imagine if I'd gotten you a hand               job by now!                                         
22) 24) dialog: So? I'm a fuckin' drug dealer. What, you             don't trust me then?                                
22) 25) text: Saul stares at Dale, who doesn't know how to respond.
22) 29) dialog: Thank you!                                          
22) 30) text: Pleased, Saul pats Dale on the back.
22) 36) text: Saul takes his cell phone out and presses speed dial. We hear someone pick up.
22) 40) dialog: Yo, Red. You okay man?
22) 45) dialog: Dude, watch the toes. Wear shoes in the house. But Red, I gotta get straight to brass tacs, I need a favor.
22) 49) dialog: You sure as fuck are, buddy. So, you know how you gave me some of that pineapple express stuff? Don't tell anyone you gave it to me.
22) 53) dialog: So, can I come on over now?
22) 54) text: Dale waves his hands in front of Saul's face.
22) 58) dialog: (covering phone, talks to Dale) I'm in the middle of a convo, man. Let's just go and get this shit over with.
22) 64) text: Saul looks around the dark forest.
22) 66) dialog: Yeah...okay. Less scary shit happens in the day.
22) 69) dialog: (into phone) Red?
22) 73) dialog: Yeah, right after I see my grandma.
22) 77) dialog: Yeah man. I've only got one. So, we'll be chillin' by noon.
22) 78) text: Saul gives Dale the thumbs up.
22) 82) dialog: We should definitely hit up the casino again sometime.
22) 85) text: Saul hangs up the cell.
22) 87) dialog: Nice. Now let's do some fucking stone cold chilling. I'll role a jigga, on the            house.                                             
24) 2) dialog: I always liked smoking weed in the                     forest.                                               
24) 3) text: Saul lights a joint and starts smoking. He passes it to Dale. Dale puffs. They look around at their expansive, dark surroundings and immediately become overwhelmed with paranoia. Saul notices a shooting star zip across the sky as Dale takes out his cell phone.
24) 6) text: As Dale dials, Saul, paranoid from the pot, looks at his cell phone. He takes another hit, and then looks up to the sky again. He looks back at Dale's phone. Dale starts to walk off.
24) 11) dialog: Dale...wait!
24) 12) text: Saul snubs out the joint and runs over to Dale.
24) 14) dialog: Yeah, the phone...I mean, I don't know how this shit works, but...can cops... you said they might be cops...could they triangulate our phones or trace `em or some shit like that? I don't know. I feel like I've seen that.
24) 15) text: Dale stares at Saul, then flips open his phone -  beep 
24) 17) dialog: I mean, shit Dale, maybe they can trace them when we're not even on them!
24) 25) dialog: It's them!!!
24) 26) text: The noise builds to a deafening crescendo as the guys dive behind a tree stump. A moment later, a JUMBO JET buzzes overhead, heading towards the nearby airport. Dale and Saul pop up.
24) 28) dialog: Holy fuck. That was close.
24) 38) dialog: No! Smash it!
24) 39) text: Dale sighs, then SMASHES his phone on a rock. Saul looks at Dale, then HURLS his phone into the woods as hard as he can, sending it SAILING into the FOREST.
24) 41) dialog: Shit!
24) 46) dialog: Fuck! I was trying to throw it at that tree!
24) 50) dialog: That one.
24) 51) text: Saul points out a group of trees about 30 feet away.
24) 53) dialog: It was a cheap piece of shit. Came free with the plan. It must've smashed when it landed.
24) 57) dialog: I was trying to smash it! How often does a guy smash things? I'm rusty. Fuck.
24) 61) dialog: Over there, somewhere. Wait! We could call it!
24) 69) dialog: Man, it's not like they got McGuyver workin' on the case. I bet they can't even triangulate it.
24) 73) dialog: Fine! Fine. Let's just find the stupid thing and get back to doing what we were doin'.
24) 78) dialog: Dude, this is the scariest place I've ever been in my life.
24) 81) dialog: You ever see that movie where all the people are in the woods and they slowly get killed?
24) 85) dialog: No...Shit. That one's way scarier than the one I was thinking of. Mine had Arnold Shwartzenegger in it. Now I'm thinking of the fucking Blair Witch.
24) 91) dialog: (whispering) What-
24) 98) dialog: (whispering) What is-
24) 102) dialog: (whispering) What?
24) 105) text: Saul listens.
24) 107) dialog: (whispering) I literally hear nothing. (gasp) Wait...
24) 108) text: SUDDENLY, Saul SPRINTS off into the darkness!
24) 111) dialog: 
24) 112) text: Dale looks in horror as Saul vanishes amongst the trees.
24) 114) dialog: (screaming in pain)
24) 120) text: Saul gets up, covered in dirt. Panting, he looks around the forest and sees no one. He thinks he hears something and SPRINTS off! WHAM! He trips on a tree root and SLAMS into the ground.
24) 129) text: Saul hears Dale and whips around, breaking a twig -
24) 132) text: Saul hears someone and BOLTS in the opposite direction.
24) 139) text: Dale sees Saul BANGING against the passenger side door.
24) 141) dialog: (muffled through the window) Let me in! Let me in!
24) 142) text: Dale unlocks the car and Saul JUMPS in.
24) 144) dialog: Let's go! Go!
24) 148) dialog: I don't know!
24) 152) dialog: I don't know! I'm freaking out, man! Let's just go!
24) 159) dialog: But there could be something out there!               
24) 163) dialog: Well, I'm not getting out of the car. I'm              staying in the car.                                   
24) 168) dialog: Talk radio? You fuckin' joshin' me? Why                don't we just shoot ourselves in the                   nuts?                                                 
24) 172) dialog: Fine. Well, I'm going to smoke a joint                 before I go to sleep, and don't worry                  about it, even though you're being a                   dick, it's on the house.                              
24) 176) dialog: Thanks to me!                                         
24) 179) text: Dale and Saul start rolling separate joints.
25) 1) text: Dale slowly wakes up. He stretches, and then shakes Saul.
25) 4) text: Saul opens his eyes and realizes where he is.
25) 6) dialog: Fuck me.
25) 10) dialog: (groggy) It's too early.

25) 13) dialog: It's...
25) 14) text: Saul stares at his watch, confused.
25) 16) dialog: This can't be right.
25) 20) dialog: It says, uh...
25) 21) text: Saul looks outside towards the sun.
25) 23) dialog: It couldn't be three in the morning, could it?
25) 27) dialog: (excited) Wait! My grandma's clocks! It's daylight savings! (beat) Fuck! No! They go forwards an hour! Dammit-
25) 34) dialog: -I didn't go to my Grandma's! Fuck! And we've gotta call Red.
25) 39) dialog: We'll find a pay pho...fuck! His number was in my phone!
25) 44) dialog: Yes, I remember. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Are you insinuating I'm forgetful? That's right, I know the word insinuating.
25) 54) dialog: Are you fucking serious?
25) 59) dialog: It's dead?                                          
25) 63) text: Dale shoots Saul an angry look.
25) 65) dialog: What the fuck happened? How did this happen?
25) 69) dialog: Yeah. With your stupid talk radio. No               surprise, that stuffs, like, made to put            people to sleep.                                   
25) 74) dialog: For real?
25) 80) text: - Dale and Saul walk down a seemingly unused forest road, each smoking their own joint.
25) 81) text: - Saul points out a giant caterpillar crawling on a leaf. Dale is grossed out. Saul pokes the caterpillar and then blows weed smoke onto it.
25) 85) text: - Dale notices Saul has his thumb sticking out of his zipper.
25) 87) dialog: It's like, my thumb is my cock!
25) 92) text: - Bored and tired, they wait.   Saul lights a joint. Dale notices. Saul shifts his body   away from Dale. Just then an eighteen wheeler slows for   them. Saul snubs out the freshly lit joint and puts it   in his pocket.
26) 1) text: Dale and Saul get out of the eighteen wheeler.
26) 3) dialog: (to the driver) Thanks a fucking ton, Sharid.
26) 4) text: Saul shuts the door and he and Dale run towards Red's house - a small, dilapidated place in a rundown part of town. Exhausted, Dale and Saul reach Red's door. Saul knocks.
26) 8) dialog: I don't know. He's short...and stout. So he's like a tea pot. Hehe.
26) 12) dialog: I don't know, I mean, we are only...eight hours late. (beat)                                          That's actually pretty late.                          
26) 16) dialog: Red! It's Saul. Open up.
26) 31) dialog: (oblivious) Dale Denton. He's with me. No worries.                
26) 37) dialog: We were in the forest laying low. Thinking.
26) 40) text: Saul finally notices Red's dishevelled appearance.
26) 42) dialog: Whoa! Dude, have you been crying?

You know? And just so you know, I totally               could have lit that cross-joint on my own. I'd just have to use candles, but, like, I've never smoked one of those with anyone before.

62) 10) dialog: Why not?                                           
62) 14) dialog: No. It happened because those fucking kids didn't keep that shit on the down low. Which is weird, `cause they really             seemed like cool kids.                             
62) 21) dialog: When I saved you with those Slurpees I was stoned. What do you gotta say to that? Maybe the pot is what gave me the creative capacity to come up with such a great plan! The Beatles were high!                    
62) 24) text: Saul lights his bowl.
62) 28) dialog: For one thing, I'm done dealing pot. Mostly, because I don't know where I would get it now, but still. And "b", fuck you, man. You can't judge me. We're exactly the same, and this whole thing's your fucking fault. You're the one who dropped the roach!
62) 31) text: Dale points at Saul's bowl.
