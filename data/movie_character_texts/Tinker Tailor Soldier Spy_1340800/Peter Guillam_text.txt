33) 0) text: PETER GUILLAM walks down a corridor. Handsome, boyish, bored. He hears a TRING behind him. It's Haydon, one foot up on his pedal, scootering along the corridor. Guillam waits for him. He likes this man.
33) 1) dialog: (of the bike)
34) 2) dialog: Peter Guillam... He listens to the voice on the other end. After a moment turns away from his colleagues, his former drowsiness abruptly gone.
40) 0) text: Smiley opens the door to PETER GUILLAM.
43) 3) dialog: Very well. (referring to the window)
43) 9) dialog: Ricki Tarr, sir. One of my scalp- hunters. He's been on the wanted list for a year. Last job was Istanbul, bit of coat-trailing for a Russian convention.
43) 11) dialog: (beat)
45) 17) text: I'll keep Peter Guillam. And there's a retired special branch man. Mendel. I'd like to have him. Lacon exhales, his relief palpable.
61) 4) dialog: Trying not to bleed to death. Fawley's got a first aid kit in one of his drawers. Get me a plaster will you? Kaspar busies himself with the first-aid. Eyes hard.
62) 3) dialog: Cut it on a drawer handle. (Beat) When are we going to get some new furniture round here?
62) 7) dialog: Lunch.
63) 2) dialog: Smothered by the Mothers.
63) 5) dialog: What does?
63) 8) text: Scrounge a fag? PETER GUILLAM
63) 11) dialog: What? ROY BLAND
63) 14) dialog: Citroen.
66) 1) dialog: Jerry Westerby, dismissed December 4th. And... Connie Sachs, retired November 28th. That's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out. Smiley considers this, turns back to the CHESS SET. He writes Connie's name on a slip of paper, pastes it to a chess piece. There is a knock at the door. Mendel lets LACON into the room excluding a very excited MRS. POPE GRAHAM. Lacon's wearing a tux, looking extremely uncomfortable, almost offended at the role he finds himself playing.
66) 5) text: Not much, I'm afraid. We were just discussing the departure of Connie Sachs. I wonder how Research manages without her. PETER GUILLAM
66) 14) dialog: Jim Prideaux. Smiley nods thoughtfully.
135) 1) dialog: You look tired. Smiley considers telling Guillam about Tarr's visit, but instinct for secrecy wins out.
135) 3) dialog: Is feeling sick to your stomach a slight reservation?
137) 4) text: Okay sir. Yellow one for the bag sir. Bryant stamps a PINK chit and hands it to Guillam, pullin open the lift cage. He gives him a yellow slip for the ba Guillam climbs inside and begins to ascend, rattlingly slowly. As Bryant's head disappears... PETER GUILLAM
137) 6) text: We keep asking... Guillam examines the chit. He wipes his hands. For the first time we realize how NERVOUS he is. Polished shoes appear as they reach the floor, then the uniform trousers of a short man. A self-important JANITOR Guillam steps out and the Janitor checks Guillam's pink a yellow chit and motions him through a turnstile. Then he stops him short. He gestures for Guillam to raise his arm PETER GUILLAM
137) 13) dialog: You don't look pleased to see me, Bill?
137) 16) dialog: Doing some research. Makes a change from sitting on my arse.
137) 18) dialog: As the grave. When're you going to give us something to do?
137) 20) dialog: Thanks anyway. Stick to sitting on my arse. They've reached the end of the corridor. Haydon peels awa a hand raised in farewell.
138) 3) dialog: Thanks...
138) 6) dialog: So, chit me. The Janitor grins, slaps a chit on the bag, raises the counter and Guillam enters.
139) 2) dialog: (rakish)
141) 4) dialog: (as though distracted)
141) 7) dialog: (into the phone)
143) 1) dialog: At least get on to the main dealers first...
144) 1) dialog: Have you got the number?
145) 1) dialog: Well, hold on... He cups his hand over the mouthpiece...
145) 2) dialog: ... Alwyn? Chuck me the bag a minute, will you? Alwyn gets Guillam's bag and brings it over to him.
145) 3) dialog: Thanks. Alwyn goes back to his post. Guillam, still hugging the phone, takes out a BEIGE file from his bag and switches i with the one against his chest. He takes an address book from the bag and finds a number.
145) 4) dialog: (Into phone)
146) 4) dialog: Of course. Esterhase turns and Guillam, mind whirring, follows him back out through the counter.
146) 5) dialog: (to Alwyn, inspired)
148) 2) text: Well now young Peter Guillam, are you ready for me finally? Guillam, affecting ease, leans against the wall.
148) 4) dialog: Couple of Arab ploys look quite promising. Other than that, getting quite good at ping-pong.
148) 7) dialog: (Not missing a beat)
148) 10) dialog: I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled. Alleline lets the silence build, rather like a bad actor. Everyone is staring at Guillam.
148) 14) text: I'm talking to you about a murderer. I'm talking to you about a defector from your own damn section! I'm accusing you of consorting with an enemy agent behind my back! Don't damn well shrug at me! How'd you like a term in prison? Guillam's own temper comes to his rescue. PETER GUILLAM
148) 17) text: So if I told you that Tarr had recently arrived in Paris would you be surprised? PETER GUILLAM
148) 20) text: Your man's a defector, Guillam. Got turned by the opposition months ago and now they've sent him back to us! PETER GUILLAM
151) 3) dialog: The hotel. I have to see George.
152) 1) dialog: George?
152) 5) text: Ricki's been helping us Peter. (Indicating TAPE DECK) He's been telling us all about his adventures. PETER GUILLAM
152) 6) text: (To Smiley) He's a double, George! There is no Mole! The whole thing's a pack of lies thought up by Moscow. Karla's bought him for thirty thousand pounds! He pulls the LOG BOOK out of his file. PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D)
152) 12) text: What was the date? Tarr hesitates, considering. PETER GUILLAM
152) 15) text: November 20th is missing. (Beat) Someone is covering their tracks Peter. Unless you think that's just a coincidence? Guillam looks thrown. PETER GUILLAM
152) 17) text: Thirty thousand isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his Mole. I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mister Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him. Guillam takes the log book from Smiley, runs a thumb down the razored edge of the missing page. He notices some writing on the next page. PETER GUILLAM
153) 1) dialog: Why didn't you tell me? That you had Tarr? Smiley looks at him. Guillam reads the look correctly.
153) 2) dialog: In case I didn't make it out of the Circus...
153) 4) dialog: I should get some rest. And I suppose you should get your reading done. Smiley nods. Doesn't move.
154) 1) dialog: I'm sorry.
154) 3) dialog: I wanted to believe Tarr was lying. (Beat) All this time, thinking I'm fighting a war. It's a sham. Karla won years ago and we didn't even know it. Smiley watches Guillam, estimating how badly all of this affecting him.
154) 24) dialog: That was Karla? And he flew back to die rather than give in?
154) 26) dialog: What did he look like?
168) 1) dialog: Haydon heard the news at his club? Smiley is distant...
168) 3) dialog: At one-thirty? The ticker-tape wouldn't be running. Guillam sits, mind racing.
168) 4) dialog: So how did he know? Oh Jesus, George...
168) 6) dialog: Jesus Christ. Haydon? How could he have known?
168) 8) dialog: Then how did he know?
188) 6) dialog: Who?
191) 1) dialog: You alright?
191) 3) dialog: Yes, George. I'll watch. Guillam watches as Smiley heads off into the gloom.
194) 2) dialog: You'll go...
214) 2) dialog: The boy stood on the burning deck whence all but he had fled. The flame that lit the battles wreck, shone round him o'er the dead... Smiley is listening.
214) 3) dialog: ... Yet beautiful and bright he stood...
233) 1) dialog: He's here.
