CONNIE SACHS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
76) 4) text: Late one night in Research, I was trawling through some footage of May Day in Berlin, 1969. I saw something, George. Connie slows the images down, concentrating... OFFICIALS suits are walking into their designated places. We see POLYAKOV amongst them. One of the old SOVIET VETERANS, in dress uniform, a chest full of medals, possibly a touch senile, LOOKS at him. Ju before he is obscured by another official we see what the veteran does.

77) 2) dialog: I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline. I said - "Polyakov is a Karla-trained Hood if ever I saw one. And if he's here it's because he's running a mole."

78) 13) dialog: A real war. Englishmen could be proud then. She stares at the photograph with a sad smile.
78) 14) dialog: I was right, then? About Polyakov. There's a mole? Smiley doesn't answer, stands up to go.

133) 3) text: I'll go find her. Smiley threads his way through the party, walking amongst his colleagues, enjoying himself... Jerry Westerby and Connie Sachs are arm in arm, singing along to a song - "T Second Worst Spy in the World." They link Smiley to them for a verse, others joining in around them. The song segu into the Russian National Anthem. The crowd sing lustily, many of them Russian-speaking, enjoying the chance to sin with vigour. Smiley walks on. Behind him the song ends to be replaced the CHARLIE RICH song we heard earlier. His P.O.V. - - One of the larger Mothers doubled up with laughter, pulling a cracker with a flushed TOBY ESTERHASE, hopeless outweighed, but competitive to the finish. - ROY BLAND with his plain wife, eyeing one of the pretty debs as she dances by.
