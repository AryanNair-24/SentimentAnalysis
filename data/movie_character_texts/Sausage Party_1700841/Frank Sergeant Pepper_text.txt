So, I guess that got me thinking... what really happens in the Great Beyond? Like what’s the deal there? Firewater is struck by the question. As he ponders, he gr his Kazoo, fills it and starts smoking it like a pipe.
18) 6) dialog: Whoaaaaa. Frank slowly inches his face towards the bag.
18) 7) dialog: I don’t see anything.
