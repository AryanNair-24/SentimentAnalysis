Suddenly one of the fluorescent ceiling lights behind her blows out with a loud WHUMPH. Anna starts. Turns. WHUMPH. The next light dies. Anna quickens her step. The lights go off one by one. The darkness quickly creeping up behind her. There’s only one light still on as she reaches the exit. She looks up. The light flickers. But then strangely stays on. Bathing her ina cold pool of light. Anna’s unsettled. She turns and frantically pushes the door. It doesn’t open. She pushes hard with both hands. Nothing. It’s locked. She turns back slowly. The darkness around her impenetrable. Almost viscous. She reaches out... ... her hand DISAPPEARS into the thick blackness. Anna snatches her hand back. Stares at it.

She stares at Paul for a moment through the window marbled with rain. Paul suddenly notices Anna at the window. He starts. Spills some of his red wine on his shirt. CLOSE on the red stain.

20) 22) dialog: You could've just told me this morning. You didn’t need to buy me off with an expensive meal. Paul reaches for her hand. Anna gets up to leave.
20) 24) dialog: Why did you lie to me? You promised everything was going to be OK.

23) 3) dialog: Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up? I just don’t want it to end like this. Anna drops the phone into her bag on the passenger seat. Wipes away the mist on the inside of the glass. A TRACTOR TRAILER shudders past loaded with metal pipes. 21.
24) 0) text: A large room. Tall vaulted ceilings. White tiles. Soft morning light seeps in from a small round window set high on one wall. The room is silent. Still. Like a chapel. In the semi-darkness we see a BODY on a porcelain slab covered with a white sheet. We hear a key turn in a lock. Then another lock. The room’s suddenly flooded with a harsh white light. Eliot steps inside the room. He takes off his jacket. Carefully places it on a coat-hanger. Puts on a pale blue smock then snaps on the latex gloves. His every move meticulous. Measured. Like a ritual. Eliot walks over to the slab, his surgery clogs softly clacking against the tiled floor. He looks at the slab for a moment then slowly pulls the sheet away revealing... ANNA'S BODY. Pale and lifeless. An ugly gash above her eyebrow. Cracked violet lips. A rip in her black dress soaked with a dark stain. She’s only wearing one shoe. Eliot gently takes off the watch from her stiff wrist. Places it inside a brown paper bag. Eases off the shoe. Picks up a scalpel from a tray of instruments on a steel trolley. Delicately slices open her dress. Peels it off. He's about to cut the straps of her RED SLIP when... Anna OPENS HER EYES. She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes. Strangely Eliot's not surprised. He calmly steps back. Watches her carefully. Anna’s eyes slowly focus on Eliot. She’s groggy. Confused 22.

30) 3) dialog: But I’m not dead. 27.
30) 5) dialog: Please. Just let me go. I won’t go to the police. I won’t tell anyone. Eliot moves her head back. Gently wipes away her tear.

Still nothing. 32.

Anna stumbles to the trolley. Feeling her way through the semi-darkness. Grabs the scissors. Just then she notices a BODY, covered with a white sheet, lying on a gurney in the corner. She turns away. Scared. But then, almost against her will, she approaches the gurney. As if drawn to the body. She slowly pulls the sheet away... The dead body of an OLD WOMAN. Staring blindly at Anna with cloudy opaque eyes. Long greasy gray hair. Shaken, Anna pushes herself against the wall.

Unsettled. Just then we hear a WOMAN’S FOOTSTEPS. Her high-heels clicking on the concrete floor. There’s something strange about the sound. UNNATURAL. Paul listens nervously. The footsteps grow fainter. Then fade away. The garage is silent again. Too quiet. Paul moves apprehensively over to Anna’s GREEN TOYOTA. The car’s a mess. One side’s completely caved in. He touches the car. Pulls open the door. Squeezes into the driver’s seat.

Then she turns her head. The Old Woman sits on the other slab. Slowly brushing her tangled gray hair with a silver backed brush. Anna looks around anxiously. The room is strangely larger. The perspective not quite right. Certain objects look absurdly small or abnormally large. She notices a TINY DOOR. Half hidden by a steel trolley. The door’s slightly ajar. Anna’s surprised. The Old Woman shakes her head. Staring blindly at Anna with opaque eyes. Anna ignores her. Moves quickly to the tiny door. As she approaches, the door seems to grow to normal size. Then we realize it’s Anna who has shrunk. The steel trolley now towers high above her. The massive instruments on the trolley look like menacing insects cast in surgical steel. She opens the door. Revealing a solid wall of DARKNESS.

Anna stumbles over to the trolley. Pushes it aside. Desperately searching for the tiny door. She touches the wall. There’s nothing there. Frustrated she turns to a counter crowded with instruments. She sweeps her arm across the counter top in rage. Sending everything crashing to the floor.
62) 0) text: Anna sits on the floor in the middle of the room. Hugging her legs to her chest. Rocking to and fro. Surrounded by broken glass, torn papers and instruments. Eliot enters the room. Coldly surveys the destruction.

This time from the bathroom. Paul walks over to the bathroom door. As he touches the door handle... the whispering STOPS. Paul hesitates. The room’s strangely silent. He slowly opens the door... INT. PAUL’S APARTMENT. BATHROOM —- CONTINUOUS Nothing. The bathroom’s empty. Paul looks around nervously. He catches the reflection of his pallid face in the mirror. lLeans wearily against the washbasin. 51. Water DRIPS from a leaky pipe. The fluorescent bulb over the mirror CRACKLES softly. Paul turns on the taps. Splashes cold water on his face. He’s about to reach for a towel when he senses something. He cocks his head slightly. A feeling. He turns and checks out the bathroom. Nothing. Paul dries his face. As he replaces the towel... the sound of dripping water ABRUPTLY STOPS. Silence. Suddenly the SHOWER STARTS RUNNING. Paul’s paralyzed with fear. Steam wreathes the room in a cloud of vapor. He turns slowly towards the shower.
64) 2) text: Anna stands in front of the shower with her back to him. She slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook. Then her hand moves to her chest. There’s a STRANGE WET SUCKING sound... .-..-as Anna rips out her heart and hangs it casually on the hook next to her bathrobe.
