On the dashboard a KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD DOLL nods its head from side to side. Anna pulls up to a red light. Glances across at the other cars. We see the vacant faces of COMMUTERS staring blankly into space. The light changes. Anna hasn’t noticed. The car behind her HONKS in frustration. She quickly pulls out... ++. just as a SUV turns in front of her. She slams on her brakes. Hard. Missing the SUV by inches. The DRIVER screams at her. His face contorted in ugly rage.

18) 2) dialog: They just seemed appropriate somehow.
19) 0) text: Anna suddenly looses it. Angrily dumps the contents of her bag onto the driveway. She kneels down. Grabs the keys. Throws the rest of her things back into the bag. She stands. Leans against the car. She looks weary. She glances up at the sky desperately trying to hold back her tears. Black storm clouds gather on the horizon. 16. Anna brusquely wipes away her eyes with the back of her hand. Pulls herself together. Angry with herself. INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT’S ROOM - DAY Eliot watches intently as Anna drives away.
24) 0) text: A large room. Tall vaulted ceilings. White tiles. Soft morning light seeps in from a small round window set high on one wall. The room is silent. Still. Like a chapel. In the semi-darkness we see a BODY on a porcelain slab covered with a white sheet. We hear a key turn in a lock. Then another lock. The room’s suddenly flooded with a harsh white light. Eliot steps inside the room. He takes off his jacket. Carefully places it on a coat-hanger. Puts on a pale blue smock then snaps on the latex gloves. His every move meticulous. Measured. Like a ritual. Eliot walks over to the slab, his surgery clogs softly clacking against the tiled floor. He looks at the slab for a moment then slowly pulls the sheet away revealing... ANNA'S BODY. Pale and lifeless. An ugly gash above her eyebrow. Cracked violet lips. A rip in her black dress soaked with a dark stain. She’s only wearing one shoe. Eliot gently takes off the watch from her stiff wrist. Places it inside a brown paper bag. Eases off the shoe. Picks up a scalpel from a tray of instruments on a steel trolley. Delicately slices open her dress. Peels it off. He's about to cut the straps of her RED SLIP when... Anna OPENS HER EYES. She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes. Strangely Eliot's not surprised. He calmly steps back. Watches her carefully. Anna’s eyes slowly focus on Eliot. She’s groggy. Confused 22.
24) 2) dialog: You're in a funeral home. (beat) You’re dead. Anna’s vacant eyes widen in shock. She struggles to sit up but she can’t even raise her head. Her body stiff. Rigid. Eliot speaks to her calmly. Soothingly.
24) 3) dialog: You had a car accident. It was raining. You hit a truck loaded with metal pipes. She looks fearfully at the bloodied dress in Eliot’s hand
24) 5) dialog: You were pronounced dead eight hours ago. Your blood no longer circulates through your body. Your brain cells are slowly dying. Your body’s already decomposing.

24) 10) dialog: You were dead on arrival. The attending physician signed here... (points to document) -.-at 9.45 last night. I picked up your body from the hospital morgue at 12.10 this morning.

24) 11) dialog: I’m sorry. Eliot picks up a sponge from the trolley. Wets it.
24) 14) dialog: I’m preparing your body. You have to look beautiful for your funeral.
24) 16) dialog: You all say the same thing. (beat) I’m sorry. Maybe you should rest now. Eliot peels off his latex gloves and heads for the door. As he hangs his pale blue smock on the peg he turns and looks at Anna for a moment.
30) 0) text: Anna lies rigidly on the slab. Her head turned to one side. Staring blankly at the wall. Her eyes glazed. Suddenly classical music fills the room. Anna frowns. Disoriented. She moves her head with difficulty. Nervously looks around. For a moment she doesn’t know where she is. Then she sees Eliot by a CD player. She watches with trepidation as he approaches her.
30) 2) dialog: (smiles) How can I hurt you? You’re already dead.
30) 4) dialog: Then why are you here? Anna doesn’t know what to say. She turns her head away. A tear falls down her cheek.
30) 6) dialog: You’re still in denial. You have to trust me. I’m only here to help you. Eliot slides a wooden head-rest under her neck and studie her wounds, touching them delicately. Thinking about how to conceal them. He turns to a tray of instruments. Picks up a needle. Leans over Anna. The needle pierces her brow. Sliding cleanly through her skin. She doesn’t feel any pain as Eliot carefully sews the wound. He’s meticulous. Clearly very good at his job. Eliot glances at his watch. Picks up a SYRINGE and an AMPOULE OF AMBER LIQUID. Draws up the amber liquid. Anna’s alarmed. She tries to pull back.
30) 7) dialog: Don’t be scared.
30) 9) dialog: This will relax your muscles. Stop the rigor mortis setting in so I can work on your body. He INJECTS Anna in the neck. Just then we hear a car pull up on the gravel driveway outside.

32) 1) dialog: Ah. Forgive me. Eliot quickly steps forward. Pulls out the needle. Cuts the thread with a pair of large scissors.
32) 2) dialog: As I said. I’ve only just started preparing her.
32) 4) dialog: (quietly to himself) No. The soul never leaves. Beatrice stares at Anna. 29.

40) 9) dialog: I’m very sorry for your loss Mr. Conran.
40) 11) dialog: I’m afraid the viewing isn’t until--

43) 6) dialog: Did you love him? Anna looks up sharply. Eliot’s clearly hit a nerve.
43) 9) dialog: No.
43) 11) dialog: Because it would only hurt you. You have to let go of the living. Just like they have to let go of you.
43) 13) dialog: You’re all the same. You all blame me for your death. As if it were my fault.
43) 15) dialog: The others. They just see you as a dead body on a slab. Only I can see you as you really are.
43) 17) dialog: I’m a busy man. I don’t have time for this. He heads to the door. Pulls out his keys and unlocks it. Just then he remembers something. Turns to her.
43) 18) dialog: Oh I nearly forgot. How tall are you?
43) 20) dialog: Five seven.

52) 7) dialog: (holds out his hand) Give me the scissors. I only want to help you.
52) 9) dialog: (calmly) Go ahead. Anna doesn’t move. Eliot looks her steadily in the eye. He reaches for her hand. Slowly. Deliberately. He brings the scissors to his cheek. Then lets go of Anna’s hand.
52) 11) dialog: Go on.
52) 13) dialog: What are you waiting for? Anna’‘s confidence falters. She slowly lowers her hand. The scissors fall onto the floor. Anna looks down defeated. Her breath labored. Suddenly she realizes...
52) 15) dialog: You think you’re still alive because you’re still attached to life. It’s normal. You're just imagining you still have symptoms of life. She's not listening. Eliot takes a roll of paper towels. Kneels down, picks up the bowl of dye and mops up the mes
52) 17) dialog: You died. Everyone dies. 42.
52) 19) dialog: We're talking not because you’re alive. But because I have a gift. (beat) I can talk to those between life and death.
52) 21) dialog: To help them make the transition. Anna’s stunned. For the first time we sense a seed of doubt in her mind.
52) 23) dialog: It depends on how you lived your life.
52) 25) dialog: Not everyone needs my help. Some let go as soon as their body dies. Others don’t let go until long after they’re in the grave.
52) 27) dialog: You're here so I can bury you. Anna’‘s silent. Trying to make sense of what she’s just heard. Eliot takes her arm. Leads her to the slab.
52) 28) dialog: Come. We've wasted enough time already. She lies down submissively. Suddenly very tired. Eliot leans over her to apply what’s left of the dye.
52) 30) dialog: You're a corpse. Your opinion doesn’t count anymore. 43.
52) 32) dialog: You people. You all think that if you breathe, shit, piss you’re alive. Anna doesn’t know what to say.
52) 33) dialog: You clutch onto life as if your life was worth clutching onto. Was your life worth clutching onto Anna? Anna turns her head away. Clearly he’s struck a chord.
52) 34) dialog: Was it? Maybe you died a long time ago. Eliot rips off his latex gloves. Tosses them into a bin.
52) 35) dialog: I have to tell you I’m surprised you’re still arguing with me. You don’t have much time left. (gestures to the Old Women) Look. She’s accepted her death. Her life has been examined. She has no more regrets. And now she’s at peace. She used her time well. You still have so much to learn.
52) 37) dialog: Are you sure? Eliot stands in the doorway. He switches off the light. His body silhouetted by the light from the hallway.
52) 38) dialog: Your funeral’s in three days. Soon you'll be enclosed in a coffin. Then buried in the ground. No-one will hear you then. No-one will talk to you there. The door clicks shut behind him. Anna doesn’t move. Clearly unsettled by Eliot’s words. After a moment she looks at the Old Woman. She moves over. Hesitantly pulls away the white sheet. Stares at the Old Woman curiously. Then tentatively touches her cheek.

60) 3) dialog: Thank-you. Eliot turns and arranges fresh flowers in the vase.

60) 17) dialog: And you are?
60) 19) dialog: Well Jack. What did you think?
60) 21) dialog: Mrs. Whitehall’s funeral. Did you find it interesting?
60) 23) dialog: Oh. I see.
60) 25) dialog: No Jack. They’re never the same. Each one is special. The dead always speak to us in different ways.
60) 27) dialog: It was a pleasure talking to you Jack. 49. Jack’s intrigued. He watches Eliot walk out of the room.
61) 0) text: As Eliot heads to the Prep Room, we hear a MUFFLED CRASH from inside. Eliot quickly pulls out his keys. Moves to the door. Just then Eliot hears a creaking sound behind him. He turns.

Then without a word, turns and heads back up the stairs.
62) 0) text: Anna sits on the floor in the middle of the room. Hugging her legs to her chest. Rocking to and fro. Surrounded by broken glass, torn papers and instruments. Eliot enters the room. Coldly surveys the destruction.

62) 2) dialog: 
62) 6) dialog: gently) It won’t be long now.
62) 9) dialog: You'll be at peace soon. I promise. For a moment we see a deep sadness in Eliot’s eyes. He's conflicted. But then abruptly he pulls himself together. Moves away and starts clearing up. Anna closes her eyes. Hugs her legs closer to her chest.
65) 0) text: Anna‘s still sitting on the floor. The place is clean and ordered again. She watches Eliot unzip a garment bag. He lifts out a plain black dress.
65) 2) dialog: It’s your dress. For your funeral. Your mother brought it round this morning. As Eliot takes out a pair of shiny black shoes from a plastic bag, Anna moves haltingly over to the dress. She touches the material puzzled.
65) 7) dialog: Why are you still struggling?
65) 9) dialog: There’s nothing out there for you anymore. As Eliot turns back to the gurney, Anna notices Eliot’s jacket hanging beside her. Realizes the KEYS are in the pocket. She quickly glances back at Eliot. He’s still busy adjusting the gurney. She leans over to his jacket.

97) 4) dialog: His mouth. To keep it closed. Eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back Frank’s lower lip. He attaches the other barb into the lower gum, then twists the wires tightly together. He picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs.
97) 5) dialog: Now his eyes. He inserts the caps into Frank’s eyes. Pulls his eyelids over them. Glues the eyelids together.
97) 7) dialog: No. There’s no need. I had to rebuild his face. You're still beautiful.
97) 9) dialog: Yes. A brother. He’s coming in later. Anna touches the white sheet covering Frank’s body.

97) 13) dialog: It’s not important anymore.
97) 15) dialog: (hesitates) No. He didn’t cry. We see a brief flicker of pain in Anna’s eyes. 67.
97) 17) dialog: You should rest. He guides her back to the slab. Helps her lie down.
97) 18) dialog: You're getting weaker. It’s almost time. Eliot strokes her hair tenderly. She looks up at him.
97) 20) dialog: Yes. Of course.
97) 22) dialog: To make life important. Anna's fingers curl around his hand. Like a vulnerable child. Totally trusting in him. Eliot looks down at Anna sadly. We sense he’s conflicted. Confused. Wavering. But then reluctantly he reaches for a SYRINGE filled with AMBER LIQUID on the steel trolley. He injects her gently in the neck. Watches over her for a moment. Then moves to the window. He picks up a window pole. Pulls the shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness
98) 0) text: Eliot moves through the Funeral Home pulling heavy drapes over the windows and closing doors. It feels like a ritual. The once airy sunlit rooms are darker now. More ominous.

98) 5) dialog: I really enjoyed our time together. We pull back slowly. Eliot’s talking to a POLAROID of an OLD MAN. We pull back further... the wall’s covered in HUNDREDS OF POLAROIDS of BODIES in open coffins. Most of them have closed eyes but we glimpse some with their eyes wide open. Eerily staring at us. Eliot touches the Polaroid of a YOUNG MAN. We see the fear in the Young Man’s eyes.
98) 6) dialog: Anthony. Anthony. Always confused. Just then we hear the doorbell ringing downstairs. Eliot moves to the window.

100) 1) dialog: Your brother's here. Vincent turns back to Eliot. We’re not sure if Eliot was speaking to Frank or to Vincent. Eliot pulls the sheet away. Frank’s face is flawless. No sign of any damage.
100) 3) dialog: You should remember him as he used to be. Suddenly we hear a FAINT RUSTLING sound. Vincent glances again at Anna's body. Her head is now turned to one side. Wasn't she facing upwards a moment ago? Vincent’s puzzled for a second then shrugs. Must have been his imagination.
100) 5) dialog: (quickly) Yes. Very tragic. Now is there anything else I can help you with? Vincent frowns. Turns back to Eliot. 70.

100) 10) dialog: Smiley.
100) 15) dialog: I’m glad I could help.
100) 17) dialog: No. Not at all. I’11 wait outside. As Eliot leaves, Vincent looks at Frank’s body. After a moment he glances at Anna again. Then at the door. He quickly moves over to Anna. Looks at her curiously then pulls down the sheet. He reaches over... and CARESSES HER BREAST. Mesmerized by her naked body. As Vincent’s hand moves down her body, he bumps against the trolley. Instruments CRASH to the floor. He pulls back the sheet just as Eliot enters the room.
100) 20) dialog: I just told you. That was your brother. (turns to Frank) You had an accident. You’re dead. Why do you people never listen to me? Frank doesn’t move. His mouth still wired shut.
100) 21) dialog: No. It's not a gift. It's a curse. Eliot picks up a compact. Roughly layers Frank’s cheeks with thick rouge. With every word he gets more agitated.

119) 18) dialog: (derisively) Happy? You all say you wanted to be happy. What does it mean Anna? To be happy?
119) 20) dialog: Yes you do! You’re just too scared to admit it to yourself. Anna turns away ashamed. She knows he’s right.

He’s about to close the door behind him...
