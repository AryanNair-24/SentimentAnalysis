6) 23) dialog: That's my fault. We took her to the fair, when she was ... eleven.
6) 25) dialog: There was a helicopter there, a small one, with the bubble up front, we called it a whirlybird. The fella, the pilot, was selling rides. I bought Karen a ticket. It wasa short ride, but when she came down... I don't think she ever came down, actually. After that she was ... up there.

It seemed after Vietnam, for a while there, we thought twice before sending our kids in harms way. Lately, though, it's more like every time some half-assed politician starts dipping in the opinion polls he invades some pisspot country. And American kids die. If he's going to do that -- it damned sure better be worth it. Damned sure. He is surprised at his own passion. He calms down.
