3) 47) dialog: Blackburn, Sacks, Boylan, I hardly knew Pittman, but now I remember every moment I spent with the poor bastard. His ugly laugh, the picture of his ugly girlfriend. His fucking bad jokes. I can even see his face when I killed him. I wasn't there but I see him. I'd have to be in the tank to see that, right, and if I was in the tank I'd be dead. But I'm not dead and I wasn't in the tank, but I see his face. Serling turns away. The light on the lake shimmers. It blinds him, but he stares into it. It's like fire.

3) 66) dialog: Shit. Oh, fuck. He lays down the rifle, takes off his shoes, shirt. Patel jumps into the water. Serling waits. He stares at the surface of the water, worried. Nothing happens, not a rip on the water. Serling pries off his shoes, staring at the water. Patella breaks the surface! Laughing.

6) 86) dialog: Sir!? Patella reaches up to touch Serling's leg with a flaming hand. The fire attaches itself to Serling and works it's way up his body. In the flickering flames Serling's face revealed. A frightened man. Stark, naked fear.
