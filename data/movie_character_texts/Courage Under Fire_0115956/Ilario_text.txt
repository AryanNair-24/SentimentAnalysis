2) 6) dialog: Fuck us. Silhouetted against the sun, enemy soldiers are descendin the ridgeline where the tank still burns.
2) 11) dialog: We're fucked. They all look at the enemy troops moving in, skittering f cover to cover, advancing on the Huey.
2) 17) dialog: I do.
2) 21) dialog: I don't hear shit. All this gunfire has made me deaf. My ears just ring.

Here's your Hismanal, Sergeant, but you want to get rid of the allergies -- bee pollen pills -- and no coffee or chocolate. Caffeine makes allergies worse.

3) 114) dialog: Sure, here you go. The aspirin are handy.
3) 116) dialog: So you know about alternative medicines, sir?
3) 118) dialog: So do I. Take one every day.
3) 120) dialog: No. Monfriez. Altameyer called Monfriez. He called me.
3) 122) dialog: Not exactly. What do you call people who shared something like we did?
3) 124) dialog: Survivors, more like it. So where do you want to do this?
3) 126) dialog: You smoke? Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org

3) 130) dialog: You think this is how the Nazis got started? Banning smoking?

3) 140) dialog: Look, you don't want to do this.
3) 142) dialog: It isn't all like the report. If you go ahead with what you got she'll get the Medal and everybody will be happy.
3) 144) dialog: Leave it be, it's better that way. Why do you want to push it?
3) 146) dialog: You could.
3) 148) dialog: You were in Saudi? See any combat?
3) 150) dialog: You lose any men? Serling nods. Ilario lets that go by.
3) 151) dialog: Have you noticed ... I have since I came back, that there's this closeness with other combat vets. This ... thing. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 87.
3) 153) dialog: Yeah? I don't buy into this "bond of war" shit, but we all know something no one else knows. Can't explain it to a civilian, not even another soldier if he hasn't been under fire. It's a secret. We never share it.
3) 155) dialog: I guess so. You won't like it. Captain Walden wasn't all that glorious a hero.
3) 157) dialog: The dust storm for instance. We were forced down by a dust storm...
4) 3) dialog: Yeah, Cap, let's try a little more.
4) 8) dialog: Well, she wasn't all fired up about going ahead. Then when we spotted Captain Fowler's Blackhawk... I knew those people, every one of them. Fowler, Tierney, Terry Gunther. He is down. Ilario has big highs and deep lows. This is the bottom of the canyon for him.
4) 10) dialog: There they are! And the tank fires. The Huey crew takes in the scenario.
4) 15) dialog: Fowler will be meat by the time Search and Rescue get here!
4) 25) dialog: Yeah. I helped. Captain Walden turned the chopper around when the first one missed...
4) 29) dialog: Please, Captain! Please! Walden turns the chopper.
4) 38) dialog: Know why I like to come here? No. Not to rubberneck the women in bikinis. The kids. I love watching kids. There's something about them. They do the damnedest things, never think about the consequences. Talk about brave.
4) 40) dialog: But can you imagine, going through life without thinking about the consequences? It's not the doing that gets you -- it's the consequences. Deep, huh? Ilario has suddenly realized he is being a motormouth.
4) 42) dialog: The night. Oh, the night. That night. We argued mainly. Captain Walden wanted to surrender at first light. Because of Rady, she said, being wounded so bad. Her responsibility was to get him medical care, she said.
4) 44) dialog: She still thought surrender was a good idea.
4) 48) dialog: Macho shit like that. He's a Ranger now.
4) 50) dialog: He wanted to fight.
4) 52) dialog: I... didn't know. I was ... scared. Really scared. You know.
4) 54) dialog: Do you?
4) 56) dialog: Sure. He doesn't believe it though.
4) 58) dialog: Well, there we were, right? On the left a big ass rock and on the right an extremely hard place and the two John Waynes stroking away until their wad was shot and me and the Captain trying to Maintain...
4) 61) dialog: Jesus H. Christ, Captain! Wait for the Cobras! The Cobras rake the enemy. Altameyer runs out of ammo, go to help Ilario with Walden.
4) 69) dialog: We felt bad for her. We were trying to be ... nice. I... I... I didn't want her folks to know she cracked. (MORE)
4) 71) dialog: Her folks are nice people, live in Abilene. They used to come over to Hood, watch her kid when we went out on exercises... Ilario is getting into an area he didn't want to go. He pulls himself out.
4) 72) dialog: That's the way it went down, Colonel. So just forget the Medal, or leave it as it is. I don't care. I gotta get back. He gets up and walks away. Serling is left on the bench, staring at Ilario's retreating back. Ilario glances over his shoulder a few times, then goes inside the Medical building. Serling, puzzled, concerned, turns to watch a tiny girl, only three or four, cannonball off the high bo

8) 2) dialog: The line between the heroes and the cowards. Serling turns to look at Ilario.
8) 3) dialog: A pretty thin line. I wonder how many "heroes" didn't cross it because they were more afraid of being called a coward than they were scared of dying.
8) 5) dialog: Wanna talk? Serling nods.
8) 6) dialog: This way. Ilario leads him away.
8) 7) dialog: You turned me in. How'd you know?
8) 9) dialog: Anything. Anything to kill the pain. He is taking Serling to the river. They find a seat ona riverfront bench. This is the San Antonio River walk, whe the river cuts through the center of downtown, a walkway each side, trees over hanging the water -- stores, restaurants, hotels lining the walk. Dark, secluded, peaceful. Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org 116.
8) 10) dialog: I want to tell you what happened to Captain Walden.
8) 12) dialog: No phone call. I do this now or not at all. You just might call the MP's on my ass.
8) 14) dialog: What time is it? Serling looks at his watch.
8) 19) dialog: And her crew.
8) 23) dialog: If it was you out there, you'd want every aircraft in the hemisphere out looking. Pass. Walden comes back.
8) 45) dialog: Both Captain Walden and I flew with Fowler at Hood. Captain "Ww" was the co-pilot, I was the Medic. When Captain "W" got her bird she took me with her.

8) 76) dialog: I wouldn't. He's barely maintaining as it is.
8) 95) dialog: I just want to get out of here.
8) 106) dialog: Maybe we should surrender. It's a mumble. The others ignore him.
8) 113) dialog: (softly) They might treat us okay. I can make a white flag.
8) 115) dialog: Guys...
8) 117) dialog: Cap... Rady's finished.
8) 119) dialog: Yes. It is word filled with shame, a blatant lie.
8) 127) dialog: You're wounded, Cap.
8) 140) dialog: Still breathing.
8) 144) dialog: Cap, let me look at that wound. I won't do anything. I promise. I swear. Please. She looks at him, thinking about it. She's in a bad way.
8) 147) dialog: Please... He's hurting as much as she is.
8) 151) dialog: I'll send back a stretcher. Walden smiles at him.
9) 5) dialog: We talked. Monfriez said she would have Court Martialed us. Altameyer agreed. Who knows? She was probably killed by enemy fire before the jets came. Who knows?
9) 7) dialog: No. And he weeps. Serling waits.
9) 8) dialog: I figured out what all those veterans have in common. Fear. They've all been scared as they will ever get. They've plumbed the bottom of fear. Petrified scared. Until your heart stops, your lungs can't get air, scared sick. And nothing can ever scare you like that again. You've seen yourself at your worst and so...
9) 10) dialog: You do?
9) 14) dialog: You have to get out of here.
9) 16) dialog: Altameyer was supposed to kill you.
9) 20) dialog: You're not going to kill him. The killing is done.
9) 22) dialog: I won't let you. You'll have to kill me first.
9) 24) dialog: Now I know what to do here... He is dazed.
9) 29) dialog: Shit. Serling looks around, desperate. On the floor, welding apparatus. Against the wall, a wheeled table for the electrician. They can hear Monfriez coming.
9) 42) dialog: You guys are good.
9) 45) dialog: I kind of owed it to Captain Walden. (MORE )
9) 47) dialog: It's what she would have done. She's the real thing.
9) 49) dialog: At the wrong time.
9) 52) dialog: And what, sir? Serling doesn't know the answer until he says it.
