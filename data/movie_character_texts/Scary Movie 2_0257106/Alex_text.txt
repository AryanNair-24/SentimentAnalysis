11) 6) dialog: Well, we never made it official, so  I guess we were technically never  really boyfriend and girlfriend, but  I was seeing him in school. I saw  him at the mall about six months ago  and I was too nervous to introduce  myself so I followed him to his car,  and jotted down the license plate  number. It was registered to his  mother, so I went to her house. She  was so nice. I mean, she seemed like  she would be nice 'cuz I never really  spoke to her. I just waited til she  went to work then I climbed in through  her window and borrowed her phone  book. I say borrowed because I'm  going to give it back one day. But  anyway, I called everyone in it til  I found her son. He wasn't home when  I called so I left this message how  much in love I was with him. I was,  and how I wanted to have his children.  Just really opening up, and he never  called back. I'd call and call, and  anyway, six months and two restraining  orders later I just decided I deserved  better. What about you? Do you have  a boyfriend?
