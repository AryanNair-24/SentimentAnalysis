4) 22) dialog: Very good, Spiria. But despite their advancements the Mithraic remain stunted by the tenets of their religion. For instance, they believe that allowing androids to raise human children is a sin. Which forced them to send an ark outfitted with stasis pods, rather than a lighter, faster craft, such as the one the atheists so wisely used to send us. She glares at Campion --
4) 23) dialog: Belief in the unreal can comfort the human mind, but it also weakens it. The civilization you're seeding here will be built on humanity's belief in itself, not an imagined deity.

You are atheists, peaceful, technocratic -- it is the only path to progress. a
