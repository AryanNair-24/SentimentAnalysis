18) 8) dialog: Later Baum started his own fund on Wall Street. He had an amazing nose for bullshit and wasn’t afraid to let everyone know when and where the bull had gone number 2. But then a tragedy happened to Mark that turned his world view dark and ready to believe the whole system was a lie.
24) 3) dialog: Because he didn’t kiss the ring of the people with the check books Mark Baum had to set up his fund under Morgan Stanley’s umbrella. His small team reflected Mark's distrust of the system.

JARED VENNETT (CONT’D) This is a basic mortgage bond. The original ones were simple, thousands of AAA mortgages bundled together and sold with a guarantee from the US government. But the modern day ones are private and are made up of layers of tranches, with the AAA highest rated getting paid first and the lowest, B rated getting paid last and taking on defaults first.

26) 6) dialog: But somewhere along the line these B and BB level tranches went from risky to dog shit. I’m talking rock bottom Fico scores, no income verification, adjustable rates... Dog shit. Default rates are already up from 1 to 4 percent. If they rise to 8 percent, and they will, a lot of these BBB's are going to zero.

But no one’s paying attention cause all the banks are busy getting paid obscene amounts of fees selling these bonds. Basically I'm standing in front of a burning house and offering you fire insurance on it. Danny's trying to get his head around Jared’s numbers.

26) 20) dialog: ...-when the market deems some bond too risky to buy, what do you think happens to it? We just warehouse them on our books?! No. They get repackaged, with a whole bunch of other shit that didn't sell, into a cDO.
26) 22) dialog: A collateralized debt obligation. A C-D-O. We put a bunch of unsold B, BB or BBB bonds together, when the pile gets large enough, the whole thing's considered diversified and the whores at the ratings agencies rate it 92, 93% AAA. No questions asked.

After he and Mark had their debate, Alan Greenspan, one of the architects of the whole crisis was scheduled to speak. Everyone in Mark’s office showed up and even invited friends.... This was Ali versus Foreman of the financial world... The realist versus the fools. If it seems almost too perfect, trust me, this happened. And it was beautiful. A podium waits for Greenspan.
