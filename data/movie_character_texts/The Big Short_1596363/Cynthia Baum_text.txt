86) 25) dialog: You love to know more than other people. To be the virtuous one. You always have Mark. As though you’re untainted and we’re al the filthy masses clawing at Noah’s arch. But the truth is: you're a banker. A banker who makes more than he should. A banker who had a terrible thing happen to a family member. And now you’re about to make a lot of money from another terrible thing. And even you can’t find a way to make that virtuous. Because it’s not. It’s just life.
