26) 25) dialog: Okay, I’m a chef on a Sunday afternoon setting the night’s menu at a big restaurant. I ordered my fish on Friday which is the mortgage bond that Michael Burry shorted. But some of the fresh fish doesn’t sell. I don’t know why, maybe it just came out halibut has the intelligence of a dolphin. So what am I going to do, throw all this unsold old fish, which is the BBB level of the bond, in the garbage and take the loss? Bourdain chops up the old fish and pushes it into the big of “SEAFOOD STEW.” ANTHONY BOURDAIN (CONT’D) No way. Being the crafty and morally onerous chef that I am, whatever crappy levels of the bond I don’t sell I throw into a “sea food stew.” See, it’s not old fish. It’s a whole new thing! And no one knows they're eating three day old halibut. That is a CDO. 4l INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 41
