67) 0) text: Vinny enters. The risk managers go silent.

70) 1) dialog: (checks his blackberry) Vennett’s coming to the office at 3. (then) You okay? Mark nods.
72) 5) dialog: Mortgage defaults are way up. Yet you quote us a higher price on the bonds. Tell me why we shouldn’t pull out of this trade right now?
72) 13) dialog: Not me.
74) 20) dialog: It’s like someone hit a pinata filled with white people who suck at golf. Who are all these clowns? 100 BUFF REVISED, MAY 11, 2015 76.
74) 28) dialog: Don’t worry. We'll be good little boys.
76) 5) dialog: Who takes a mortgage if they can’t make the first payment?
76) 8) dialog: (whispers) Hey Mark, this isn’t a Q and A... Mark juts his hand up even higher.

99) 8) dialog: Or... we sell our swaps, when the market opens. We get our bonuses and our investors get their profits. We'd get 30 cents on the dollar. Not bad.
