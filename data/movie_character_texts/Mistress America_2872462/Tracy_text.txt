0) 2) dialog: Sorry. (pause) I’m your roommate.
0) 6) dialog: A TRACKING DEVICE for Tracy...
0) 8) text: Tracy sits in her new dorm-room with her roommate, a girl with mousy hair and a hoodie. She watches Tracy unpack, f her bed.
0) 9) dialog: Aren’t you coming to convocation?
0) 11) dialog: Yeah... isn’t everyone?
0) 13) dialog: What? Why rapists?
0) 15) dialog: I think it’s just a candle lighting ceremony. (pause) How do you already know all this stuff? School hasn’t even started yet. Ruth doesn’t answer.
0) 21) dialog: (frowns, to the person next to her.) A “B.” That’s so annoying.
0) 24) dialog: Um, I have trouble with procrastinating.
0) 26) dialog: (hesitates) Yes, I have thought of that. I have trouble doing it.
0) 28) dialog: OK, thanks. Harder? I’11 try that.
0) 36) dialog: Is the party at the end of the hall?
0) 38) dialog: No...
0) 41) text: Tracy sits on steps. She’s on the phone with her Mom.
0) 42) dialog: I could be anywhere. It doesn’t even feel like New York. And by trying to participate I’m somehow fitting in even less. Her Mom moves through the kitchen, cleaning, putting thin away.
0) 46) dialog: You know the feeling of being at a party where you don’t know anybody? It’s like that the whole time.
0) 48) dialog: And I can’t go to bars.
0) 50) dialog: I liked it. I think there is a darker element to what Shakespeare was saying but I liked it.
0) 52) dialog: I like David’s guitar playing.
0) 54) dialog: Right.
0) 58) dialog: (playful back) Oh, Stevie.
0) 60) dialog: I was NOT out of school. You broke up when I was a junior in high school.
0) 62) dialog: I love you Mom, don’t be worried.
0) 64) dialog: I’m so bad at calling people I don’t know.
0) 68) dialog: Aces.
0) 70) dialog: Okay.
0) 75) dialog: (wiping drool from her chin) Oh...thanks. Tracy sits up straighter. She tries to focus on the discussion. Her eyes fall heavy and shut. She’s asleep again.
1) 0) text: Tony carries a briefcase. Tracy, deciding to make her fat better, walks up to him.
1) 1) dialog: That was really nice of you... waking me up.
1) 3) dialog: Thanks. I like moxie.
1) 5) dialog: Loans everywhere.
1) 7) dialog: Yes but... well, I have to get somewhere by five.
1) 9) dialog: Um, it’s embarrassing.
1) 11) dialog: I’m submitting a story to the Mobius Literary Society. I have to print it. (MORE )
1) 14) dialog: They said they’d post a list -
1) 16) dialog: (smiling at the thought) Yeah.
1) 22) dialog: I know, but I wanted to be one of them. I could die then.
1) 24) dialog: I heard they serve wine and cheese and they all carry breifcases.
1) 26) dialog: I heard the pie stuff all night.
1) 28) dialog: I’m so sorry.
1) 30) dialog: Sure.
1) 34) dialog: Thanks - I liked yours too.
1) 36) dialog: Oh, are we - sure...
1) 38) dialog: Okay.
1) 40) dialog: I‘’1l work on that.
1) 42) dialog: Um... no.
1) 45) dialog: Let’s go to the beach.
1) 47) dialog: Oh, why are we in your car then?
1) 49) dialog: We look like we’re in a song.
1) 51) dialog: I think the way Aristotle writes about ethics and morality is much closer to how most people think about it. Less like math, more like a story.
1) 53) dialog: I think we should set up a recycling system for our trash. A lot of what we’re throwing out can be recycled. She trips over something on the floor but recovers quickl
1) 54) dialog: And Ruth, I think that fan can go in the closet now, it’s 60 degrees out--
1) 57) dialog: I love filing! It’s satisfying.
1) 60) dialog: Hey. 13.
1) 66) dialog: Hello?
1) 68) dialog: Oh...sorry. Hi... this is Tracy Fishko, um, my mom is marrying your dad?
1) 70) dialog: Right! We’re doing Thanksgiving and then wedding together... Um, I go to college in the city. My mom said I should call you.
1) 72) dialog: (looks at her near- finished plate) No, I haven’t. OK.
1) 76) dialog: Times Square is so crazy.
1) 78) dialog: I don’t know anyone who lives here.
1) 82) dialog: College - I go to Barnard - it’s all women uptown - well, “historically” and kind of actually. But there are boys in my classes and stuff. From Columbia. 15.
1) 84) dialog: No. The Columbia girls do their best to make us feel inferior. Which it’s like “I already do.”
1) 86) dialog: You're right, that is stupid. It’s the best someone has made her feel in a long time or Maybe ever.
1) 89) dialog: Oh. OK.
1) 91) dialog: Yes.
1) 95) dialog: It has mint! CUT TO: Brooke and Tracy dance with the guys.
1) 97) dialog: (also dancing) I don’t know, everyone’s really excited about the frozen yogurt machine in the student center.
1) 99) dialog: What?
1) 101) dialog: I don’t know any dead people.
1) 107) dialog: (vaguely) I’1l look here. Tracy starts going through the closet.
1) 109) dialog: Shit.
1) 111) dialog: What were the T-shirts?
1) 113) dialog: Oh my God! I bought one of those T- shirts!
1) 115) dialog: That’s a great one.
1) 117) dialog: So...wait, you broke up with Dylan? I thought she stole him?
1) 120) dialog: Yeah, Greenwich, grossville.
1) 122) dialog: (instant disciple) I hate them.
1) 124) dialog: These?!
1) 129) dialog: Is he your boyfriend? The bassist? 19.
1) 131) dialog: (dead serious) I won’t. I’m good at keeping secrets. You’ll learn that about me.
1) 134) dialog: Nah, there’s this one guy, we got rejected together...but he’s got a girlfriend.
1) 136) dialog: Actually I think he met me and then he got a girlfriend. (pause) This summer, at my job, one guy just sucked on my boobs all night.
1) 138) dialog: (nods, stuffing a pierogi in her mouth) This is my second dinner. Brooke takes out her phone and types something.
1) 142) dialog: What are you selling?
1) 144) dialog: Would you sing them in a higher pitch?
1) 146) dialog: That’s clever.
1) 148) dialog: That sounds like she’s America’s girl on the side.
1) 150) dialog: Me too! I’m sorry, I don’t know anything, I was just throwing something out there. 21. They both laugh.
1) 154) dialog: It’s so stylish.
1) 156) dialog: Oh my God, yeah.
1) 158) dialog: Cool.
1) 161) dialog: I want to write short stories.
1) 165) dialog: I wish. Mobius is a big deal at school.
1) 167) dialog: (smiling) Maybe I’1l write something else and resubmit. (falling asleep, eyes closed) That was really funny when we were doctors.
1) 169) dialog: Thank you Brooke.
1) 174) dialog: (looking at the coffee maker) I don’t know how...
1) 176) dialog: Um, where are you going.
1) 180) dialog: Sorry. Are you... mad at me?
1) 184) dialog: We never went to restaurants growing up - it wasn’t part of our lives.
1) 186) dialog: I didn’t mean - I know people will come to yours. (trying to contextualize) It’s so weird to think that every restaurant I see is the result of some person going “I think I want to start a restaurant.”
1) 189) dialog: I’m actually... it’s embarrassing.
1) 191) dialog: I’m writing down what I said.
1) 193) dialog: Yeah... I guess so.
1) 195) dialog: Oh yeah? 25.
1) 199) dialog: Yeah, it was... (blurts it out) The best of my life.
1) 201) dialog: What did she...say? Talking while she types.
1) 202) dialog: Right! “He’s one of those people that I hate except I’m in love with him.”
1) 204) dialog: Meadow DeRiggi lived exactly how a young woman should live who wants to spend her youth well. CUT TO: Brooke’s Twitter page. Random photos of Brooke.
1) 205) dialog: She did everything and nothing and spent time like I always mean to - purposefully. CLOSE on Tracy’s short story. CLOSE on a Society page photo. CLOSE on Brooke’s Soul Cycle Teacher bio.
1) 207) dialog: Her beauty was that rare kind that made you want to look more like yourself not like her.
1) 209) dialog: She sang with the band and knew everyone and didn't owe anyone anything and couldn't pay up even if she did.
1) 211) dialog: Being around Meadow was like being in New York City - it made you want to find life, not hide from it.
1) 212) dialog: (embarrassed) Sorry. 27.
1) 218) dialog: I went to check out this downtown band at this downtown bar. Two freshmen girls approach.
1) 220) dialog: A long time, dude.
1) 223) dialog: Myself.
1) 225) dialog: It’s a place my sister showed me.
1) 227) dialog: I do. Or I will. When my mom gets married at Thanksgiving.
1) 231) dialog: It's a new story I wrote. I’m going to resubmit to the Lit Society.
1) 233) dialog: You can read it if you want. Here-- She hands him a copy - he looks at it.
1) 235) dialog: I’m past that stuff now. This one is more autobiographical documentary.
1) 237) dialog: No, I don’t want notes -- but I thought about it and I actually do have notes for you.
1) 239) dialog: You write like you are imitating someone who is free and wild and it is so WEIRD because you aren’t at all and it made me uncomfortable and I think it would make EVERYONE uncomfortable. And also, stop trying to be funny because you aren’t funny so it just adds to the awkwardness. And it could be 30% shorter, easy.
1) 241) dialog: It’s open, bitches. They don’t need it anymore.
2) 0) text: Tracy is really sweaty, still.
2) 2) dialog: I feel like I just went swimming in my clothes.
2) 4) dialog: You are?!
2) 7) dialog: This air conditioning is making me freezing.
2) 11) dialog: You look beautiful. 31.
2) 13) dialog: No, it’s the opposite - they need you and your restaurant.
2) 15) dialog: (sincerely) I think you can do anything. Everything. Brooke nods.
2) 18) dialog: Your body language looked very self- confident.
2) 24) dialog: Yeah, suburban New Jersey isn’t great with this kind of stuff.
2) 26) dialog: Can I be a waitress here? Brooke opens a box.
2) 28) dialog: (taking in the whole thing) Holy shit you have a lot of plates.
2) 30) dialog: This is going to be a great restaurant.
2) 32) dialog: Are you going to cook, too?
2) 34) dialog: (trying it out) “Let’s go to Mom’s for dinner.” Yeah, it totally works. (tries again) Can I be a waitress here?
2) 38) dialog: Yeah! 34.
2) 40) dialog: I’ve always been a good test taker.
2) 42) dialog: So, um, should I - just wait here or...
2) 44) dialog: Right. I should....
2) 46) dialog: I mean, if you don’t mind...
2) 48) dialog: That’s okay, then, I’1ll just go - Brooke hands her keys, not listening to her.
2) 50) dialog: (thrilled) Seriously?
2) 52) dialog: What kind of-- But Brooke is ringing the bell.
2) 54) dialog: (into answering machine) Mom - hey - are you there? SHIT.
2) 56) dialog: (leaving message) I just wanted to know - what kind of pasta would you buy if you wanted to buy a nice pasta? - Like the brand? If you get this can you call me back right away? She hangs ups. CUT TO: Tracy is on the phone with Tony, scanning the bra
2) 57) dialog: This one is like bowties? Get that? CUT TO: Tony and Nicolette together in his bed. Nicolette angry.
2) 59) dialog: Is that pasta the same way as the others? 36.
2) 62) dialog: Hello?
2) 66) dialog: I’1l get that and I'll get the bowties. And there’s shells--
2) 73) dialog: I remembered looking across the river at the unblinking lights of Manhattan apartments, wondering who lived there. She touches items, looks at things, takes notes. Takes a tiny airplane and puts it in her pocket. Flips through so SAT prep books.
2) 74) dialog: I was part of it now, on the fifth floor, in a temporary commercial apartment. There was our castle. Our fortress. Yes! This is how I imagined it would be: college, New York, my whole entire life. Brooke cooks while Tracy watches her and hands her things
2) 75) dialog: But outside the windows I could hear the hot sound of jackhammers taking the city apart. Brooke and Tracy eat spaghetti carbonara.
2) 76) dialog: In New York neighborhoods change as quickly as the weather. Or maybe it’s the other way around.
2) 78) dialog: But I couldn’t warn Meadow. By the time I noticed it, it was already too late. 38.
2) 81) dialog: It’s you guys kissing.
2) 83) dialog: It looks like a really stylish breathmint ad.
2) 85) dialog: (to the bartender) Did these two drinks earn me another free hot dog? The Bartender nods, hands her a hotdog.
2) 87) dialog: Yeah, on a free dating website. They didn’t even pay.
2) 91) dialog: Yeah! What’s that about?
2) 93) dialog: I know. I had never met a geologist before.
2) 95) dialog: What did your Mom do?
2) 97) dialog: That’s so nice.
2) 99) dialog: She doesn’t look like you but she has your expression, you know? A woman around Brooke’s age approaches:
2) 143) dialog: When I was in junior high, this girl Tara Podwoski used to pull my hair and call me a cunt hunter.
2) 145) dialog: Maybe do it later?
2) 147) dialog: That’s why you were popular. The popular kids never care. I cared too much. Like if you want to know all the popular kids’ business, ask an unpopular kid. They always know everything. Because they are the ones who really pay attention.
2) 151) dialog: I’1l be okay.
2) 153) dialog: Can I...would it be OK if I slept over again?
2) 155) dialog: I’m pretty sure college is supposed to be more fun than I’m having.
2) 157) dialog: I’m kind of attractive.
2) 159) dialog: I might be up for another drink. Is that crazy?
2) 161) dialog: What?
2) 164) dialog: What’s happening? 45.
2) 171) dialog: I might have closed it.
2) 173) dialog: I didn’t want you to get robbed. INT. KAREEM’S APARTMENT. NIGHT Tracy and Kareem sit on a couch waiting. Outside on the f escape Brooke is yelling on her phone.
2) 174) dialog: Stavros saw a picture of her kissing a musician. (pause) Stavros is her boyfriend. He told the super that Brooke was living in a commercial space. Is your place zoned commercial?
2) 176) dialog: I hope he doesn’t rat on you. They hear louder shouting from the fire escape. The windo opens. Brooke steps inside. Her make up is smeared. She’s been crying.
2) 178) dialog: I hope Stavros doesn’t rat out Kareem.
2) 180) dialog: Rich people always give out bad Halloween candy.
2) 182) dialog: Isn’t there someone else you can ask to invest?
2) 184) dialog: I don’t know, it’s such a good investment. I’d put money in if I had it.
2) 186) dialog: No. My mom never worked and I think my Dad was always kind of mad at her for that... but my parents divorce was way easier than this.
2) 191) dialog: (immediately) I’m coming.
2) 194) dialog: I know what it is to want things. 48.
2) 203) dialog: (suddenly) It’s your friend - Mamie-Claire? The fabric is the T-shirts! Brooke shoots Tracy a look.
2) 205) dialog: Hard looking flowers!
2) 210) dialog: She totally screwed Brooke over. She married her fiance and stole her idea.
2) 213) dialog: You said she lives in Connecticut! There are trees in Connecticut. The Psychic looks at Brooke for affirmation.
2) 215) dialog: You have to listen to Spirit! Mamie-Claire can give you the money! Hi-ho Greenwich!
2) 225) dialog: We're going.
2) 227) dialog: (smiling) I’m ready.
2) 230) dialog: (to Tony) You're going to want to take the Merrit Parkway. 51.
2) 232) dialog: Even if he’s not, this is a great investment. And don’t forget she still owes you.
2) 246) dialog: Do you ever get that feeling when you are on a car trip that you never want to get where you’re going. That you never want it to end. Everyone is silent, thinking about it. Nicolette reaches to playfully touch Tony’s hair. Tony freaks.
2) 252) dialog: No, he knew me, he chose her.
2) 254) dialog: (shrugs) I was just going to let it go.
2) 256) dialog: I’m just normal! (taking the bait) I‘1l give him a back rub he won't soon forget. Brooke gives her a half hug/squeeze, jokingly.
2) 258) dialog: But the very things that had worked so well for Meadow up until then had started turning and fading. She had no other skills, no other way of dealing with the world. In one instant her behaviors turned from charming to borderline hysteric. People could feel her failure coming. She smelled of something rotten. Her youth had died and she was dragging around the decaying carcass. CUT TO: Entering Greenwich, Connecticut. The houses flyin by become bigger and bigger. More elegant. This is the wealthy.
2) 259) dialog: I had somehow become the pallbearer. 54.
2) 260) dialog: I’m trying to find Mamie-Claire’s address. Does she have a different last name?
2) 262) dialog: Oh you’ve been here?
2) 284) dialog: Hi, I’m Tracy.
2) 305) dialog: This place is amazing.
2) 313) dialog: I would do that if I could. I wasn’t good at sports.
2) 315) dialog: When does that become the same thing? 59.
2) 321) dialog: (piping up, to Mamie- Claire) I’m an associate and her almost- sister.
2) 328) text: (to Tracy) Remember this truth: It’s only people who don’t have jobs and don’t have anything to do that are always fucking BUSY. Like what are you DOING?!
2) 350) dialog: She has a very exciting business opportunity for you.
2) 357) dialog: There are lots of other investors.
2) 373) dialog: And it really would make a profit!
2) 376) dialog: (trying to stop her) Um, Brooke...
2) 393) dialog: (indignant to Mamie- Claire) So you deny it? That you profited from her idea that you stole?
2) 395) dialog: Then why did you just say that?!
2) 397) dialog: You took her idea. That’s not just, Mamie-Claire.
2) 399) dialog: So it’s her fault.
2) 401) dialog: So it’s... no one’s fault.
2) 403) dialog: You know the restaurant is going to be really great. She’s following through with that. If she’s allowed to. Tracy leaves to go find Brooke. At the chess table:
2) 446) dialog: (startles) Hello.
2) 448) dialog: (saucily) Are you stalking me?
2) 450) dialog: Let me have a sip. She takes the glass from him. He looks at her.
2) 452) dialog: I don’t know, however long it takes. After Dylan comes home maybe.
2) 454) dialog: (looking around the room) I’m enjoying this really stylish house. When you live in suburbia you have to really like being in your house.
2) 456) dialog: I want Brooke to get her restaurant. I’m helping out. Tony goes to his backpack, which was thrown on the couch. Opens it and retrieves the pages she had given him.
2) 458) dialog: Did you like it? 71.
2) 460) dialog: Why are you here?
2) 462) dialog: How does it feel to be forced?
2) 464) dialog: And how do you feel now?
2) 467) dialog: It is what you want, but it makes you feel like a bad person to want it.
2) 469) dialog: Why can’t you say you liked my story? 72.
2) 471) dialog: You want other people to do the things that you can’t so you can blame them.
2) 473) dialog: I’m the same. I’m just the same in another direction now. Tony and Tracy leave. Nicolette enters, goes to Tony’s backpack and takes out the story.
2) 494) dialog: I’m Tracy.
2) 498) dialog: I am actually named Tracy.
2) 500) dialog: (turning) Yeah? Brooke enters. Dylan sees Brooke.
2) 504) dialog: (to Brooke) What were you going to say?
2) 507) dialog: Forget about Nicolette for a second.
2) 535) dialog: She’s starting a restaurant. 77.
2) 541) dialog: (piping in) You seem really cool to me.
2) 544) dialog: I do./I do.
2) 547) dialog: Brooke teaches cycling.
2) 568) dialog: It was clear that the thing that Meadow wanted most in the world - the thing that she wanted to define her, to absolve her from the struggle of explaining herself, to give her a place to put her time and talents - her everything - the restaurant. Tony pounds on the door.
2) 569) dialog: It was clear that it would never happen. The most surprising thing was that Meadow was actually surprised by it. She could see the whole world with painful accuracy but couldn’t see herself or her fate.
2) 572) dialog: The most surprising thing was that Meadow was actually surprised by it. (MORE )
2) 574) dialog: And because I was in love with her, I decided I couldn’t see it either. The conversations overlap.
2) 588) dialog: Why don’t we all sit down somewhere comfortable and listen to what Brooke has to say...
2) 593) dialog: I’m into compressed MP3’s. Just joking.
2) 605) dialog: No one who comes there will want to take out their cell phones because it won't feel that way. It would be like taking out your cell phone in the woods - totally wrong.
2) 607) dialog: Yeah. It will always feel like fall inside - even on hot summer nights with all the windows open.
2) 609) dialog: (standing up) It would be the best of capitalism. What politicians pretend they mean when they say “small business.”
2) 611) dialog: Chefs and actors who are waiters - it would be a big funny family and they’d never be lonely. Silence. 84.
2) 618) dialog: No, but we’re sisters and I’m--
2) 620) dialog: (thrilled) Really? I wasn’t sure you had heard me those times.
2) 624) dialog: For refrigeration.
2) 653) dialog: You are such a Swiss Army knife kind of guy.
2) 655) dialog: She’s angry about the chess game?
2) 657) dialog: Did you... did you want to be with me ever?
2) 659) dialog: No, I’m not going to kiss you. Just a question. Tony considers: 88.
2) 661) dialog: Why?
2) 663) dialog: (nodding) Sometimes I really think I’m just smarter and better than everyone else. Not necessarily with math or science or whether something is east or west but pretty much with everything else. And if I could just figure out my look I'd be the most beautiful woman in the world too.
2) 700) dialog: Did you ever find the pot? Tony just made a beautiful apple bong.
2) 704) dialog: Yay!
2) 711) dialog: And then for the whole restaurant?
2) 713) dialog: Oh.
2) 717) dialog: “Mom's” wasn’t about money.
2) 719) dialog: Do they not?
2) 726) dialog: What will you do?
2) 728) dialog: I’m so impressed by you and worried for you at the same time. She hugs Brooke.
2) 729) dialog: I’m so glad you're my sister. Brooke is about to say something when they HEAR SHOUTING. INT. MAMIE-CLAIRE’S LIVING ROOM. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING Dylan, Mamie-Claire, Brooke and Tracy enter. Nicolette an Tony are arguing.
2) 740) dialog: I am not!
2) 753) dialog: (to Brooke) It’s not you... It’s just inspired. You make me want to write.
2) 762) dialog: No I didn’t!
2) 767) dialog: (to Brooke) Oh, it’s not really you, but it’s very funny, the character that Nicolette and Tony misconstrued as you is a very funny character.
2) 769) dialog: It’s not funny. It’s just...it’s not you.
2) 772) dialog: It wasn’t meant to be hurtful - I didn’t mean to hurt you, Brooke.
2) 774) dialog: I can only tell you my intention. 98.
2) 776) dialog: I guess so, yeah, it felt longer.
2) 778) dialog: No! It’s fiction that’s why it’s fiction...
2) 780) dialog: I'm just writing from my life...
2) 782) dialog: But I was there that night.
2) 784) dialog: But I did have it though.
2) 786) dialog: You loved being admired by me, you loved it, you loved having lessons to impart...
2) 788) dialog: Brooke, you know great plays, right? - how would it have been if Tennessee Williams hadn’t used people he knew, there wouldn’t be any plays, there wouldn’t -
2) 790) dialog: You took something I said and made a tweet about it! What about that?
2) 792) dialog: That’s not the point I’m asking you to empathize.
2) 794) dialog: Stop talking about Twitter, it’s so awkward!
2) 798) dialog: You talk about it all the time, but you never talk about HER. You just throw out that she died and that shuts everyone up. (MORE )
2) 800) dialog: Your tragedy is your armor in which nothing is ever your fault. Brooke looks around, desperately wild eyed, looking for support.

Being a beacon of hope for lesser people is a lonely business. And as Brooke and Tracy talk and reminisce and laugh, we TO BLACK.
