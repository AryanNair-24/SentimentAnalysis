1) 64) dialog: She quickly presses that name...
1) 67) dialog: Hi, this Brooke Cardinas. I just got a missed call from this number.
1) 69) dialog: You're reading the sonnet.
1) 71) dialog: Have you eaten? Do you want to hang out? 14.
1) 73) dialog: Well, do you know where Times Square is?
1) 75) dialog: (awkwardly grand) Welcome to the Great White Way. She still hasn’t finished walking the steps. It takes a second. Tracy holds a smile. Finally, Brooke is there:
1) 77) dialog: Isn't it?
1) 79) dialog: Yours truly. I got off the bus from Jersey I thought this was the cool place to live. It’s mother fucking Times Square.
1) 81) dialog: Why do you live in New York again?
1) 83) dialog: You gay?
1) 85) dialog: That’s stupid. Don’t feel inferior.
1) 88) dialog: I didn’t go to college.
1) 90) dialog: I’m an autodidact. Do you know what that means?
1) 92) dialog: That word is one of the things I self-taught myself. CUT TO: Brooke is pulled up onstage to sing, she tries to act like she doesn’t want to and then does it. When she dances while she sings it’s a person who is pretending to free.
1) 96) dialog: (dancing) What’s going on at college?
1) 98) dialog: I watched my mother die.
1) 100) dialog: I was with my mother while she died.
1) 102) dialog: That’s cool about the frozen yogurt machine. Everyone I love dies.
1) 106) dialog: This bitch stole my favorite pants - they’re in here somewhere - she thinks I don’t know but I know everything. They're red. 17.
1) 108) dialog: People are always taking my shit. My ex-friend and nemesis, Mamie- Claire, stole my ideas AND my fiance.
1) 110) dialog: She took this T-shirt idea that I had, started a company fucking sold it to J. Crew so there is that. She’s one of those people who doesn’t have any good ideas for her own life so she just steals all of mine. And then she LITERALLY stole my cats.
1) 112) dialog: Just really hard looking flowers.
1) 114) dialog: Yeah, flowers with like skulls and shit. Daggers.
1) 116) dialog: My fiance, Dylan, was super sexy. And so rich. But I wasn’t going to marry him.
1) 118) dialog: And I never looked back. He cried so hard. Like, whiney. 18. She does an impression:
1) 119) dialog: “Where are you going?” (back to herself) I was being real, but Mamie-Claire then goes and marries him. They live in Greenwich, Connecticut in some big gross house. Do you know that place?
1) 121) dialog: Right? Living off of his riches and my T-shirt idea.
1) 123) dialog: I actually pity them. They have no more dreams. Tracy holds up a pair of red pants, triumphant.
1) 125) dialog: I want to MARRY you! She grabs the pants, stuffs them in her purse and then ge out of the closet.
1) 127) dialog: Must we all document ourselves all the time? MUST WE?!
1) 130) dialog: Nate? No! My beau, Stavros, is in Greece right now. Betting against the country or something gross. Don’t tell anyone that.
1) 132) dialog: He’s one of those people I hate except I’m in love with him. I’ve been to a Greek Orthodox Easter and I could totally see myself getting married in that kind of church. She knocks her head for wood.
1) 133) dialog: You got a honey?
1) 135) dialog: They all have girlfriends.
1) 137) dialog: (thinking aloud) My restaurant should do a pierogi. Fusion pierogi. You like yours?
1) 139) dialog: (putting her phone back) Just a quick tweet on Twitter. (MORE )
1) 141) dialog: I am VERY into social media. You have to market yourself. If you don’t know what you’re selling, no one will know how to buy it.
1) 143) dialog: So many things. I don’t tweet all of it. Like here are two ideas that are not on the internet. If I did a cabaret, it would be called “High Standards” and I'd sing all the standards.
1) 145) dialog: No, it wouldn’t be about - it’s about principles, those kinds of high standards - like one of those “string of pearls that’s why I’ma single gal” kind of show.
1) 147) dialog: The second idea is a television show, which I’ve read is the new novel, about a woman who is a government worker by day and a self- invented super hero by night, but like the essence of AMERICA. It’1l be it’s own mythology. I think maybe it’1ll be called Mistress America.
1) 149) dialog: Hey, I don’t know, okay, I’m not positive, these are just some ideas.
1) 151) dialog: (an idea) We need a sleep-over party.
1) 153) dialog: This apartment is technically zoned commercial but that’s fake.
1) 155) dialog: Fuck, I know, I freelance as an interior decorator. You know the Bowery Hotel?
1) 157) dialog: Well, if you walk about a block south. There’s a laser hair removal center that’s very hip. I did the waiting room.
1) 159) dialog: I know.
1) 160) dialog: I’m leaving here in January anyway, moving to the East side if you can believe it. That’s where Stavros lives. I’m going to redo his place too. Brooke flops on her bed. Tracy lies on the couch.
1) 162) dialog: Oh, me too! Not short stories, though.
1) 164) dialog: Why don’t you make your own Lit Society?
1) 166) dialog: You've got other stories.
1) 168) dialog: Yeah, I need to cut all the negative people out of my life. I just wasn’t brought up that way.
1) 170) dialog: You’re welcome Baby Tracy. INT. BROOKE’S APARTMENT. NEXT MORNING Brooke is on the phone with Stavros:
1) 171) dialog: My sweetheart I miss you so much - I can’t wait for you to see the chairs I’ve picked out - we start renovation Monday! It’s so exciting. I’ve been going there just to sit in the mess I love it so much. Tracy wakes up a little with the noise. 23.
1) 172) dialog: Right. Did you see the lease it was 400 pages! I wish you would just come home already so I can suck your dick in our new restaurant! She pads into the kitchen.
1) 173) dialog: (to Tracy) Can you start the coffee, please?
1) 175) dialog: (a little sharply) Yes, you do. Don’t be incompetent. If you spent two seconds with a coffee maker you'd figure it out. You just aren’t trying hard enough. Brooke retreats into the hall, still talking to her boyfriend.
1) 177) dialog: 
1) 181) dialog: 
1) 183) dialog: We have four investors including me. I’m what you call a principal investor. Stavros is putting in my share - but I insisted that it be my assets on the line because I want him to know I have skin in the game. I’11 pay him back of course once we start making a profit. 24.
1) 185) dialog: (immediately offended) That’s a shitty thing to say to me.
1) 187) dialog: That’s not weird. That’s everything. Tracy starts to write something down in a notebook. Brook is curious:
1) 188) dialog: What are you doing?
1) 190) dialog: What?
1) 192) dialog: You are noting yourself?
1) 194) dialog: I’ve noticed something about myself that would make a good character in a story.
1) 196) dialog: But I’m going to save it in case I want to use it in something I write.
1) 198) dialog: High five, sister. That was an AMAZING night.
1) 200) dialog: (looking at her phone) I gotta go. Brooke abruptly hugs her and leaves. Tracy watches her go for one second and then also turns to go. She’s disappoin but she doesn’t know why. INT. TRACY’S DORM ROOM. MORNING Tracy enters and goes right to her computer. Tracy is typing very quickly, still in her jacket, her ba still on her shoulder. She hesitates, trying to remember something.
1) 244) dialog: (too loudly) Hey Baby Tracy! Brooke indicates a bike with a nod of her head. Tracy sha her head emphatically: No. Brooke nods, Yes. CUT TO: Tracy is on a bike sweating an uncomfortable amou
1) 245) dialog: (to her cycling class)
2) 1) dialog: You did great!
2) 3) dialog: I’m glad you came.
2) 5) dialog: Shit, I have to shower and change, I’m late for an appointment.
2) 10) dialog: (pulling down the sides of her skirt) God, I’m packed into this pencil skirt. How do I look?
2) 12) dialog: But do I look professional? (pause) I get really nervous with the investors. I’m usually fine with wealthy people, it’s just when I need something from them.
2) 14) dialog: Stavros usually does this stuff. Maybe I shouldn’t do it. I’m not good at it.
2) 16) dialog: Right. Kind and fearless. She goes inside. CUT TO: Tracy watches through the window. Brooke sits amongst three men in suits and another powerful looking w in a suit. She makes them laugh. CUT TO: Brooke meets Tracy outside. Brooke looks relieved
2) 17) dialog: It’s amazing how much of business is just stating the same things over and over again.
2) 19) dialog: Thanks. You make me feel really... Smart. Tracy beams.
2) 20) dialog: Wanna see it? 32.
2) 22) dialog: (gesturing) The front part would be like a shop during the day - like a general store or a really nice bodega - candy from Europe - on Monday we start demo and we open in April. She knocks her head for “wood.” She leads Tracy through t back -
2) 23) dialog: We'd also have cooking classes. Maybe cut hair. It would be like a community center and restaurant and store all in one. It would be the place that you would, like, LOVE to be. I wish I had something like this when I was growing up.
2) 25) dialog: Each plate would be different. Let me show you.
2) 27) dialog: See! Look at all these plates!
2) 29) dialog: I started collecting them so long ago - I didn’t know why and now I have a why! Tracy's been touching all of them. 33.
2) 31) dialog: I know!
2) 33) dialog: (shakes her head) I‘1l help create the menu and pitch in when needed. I’m not trained, but I’m an enthusiastic home cook. I always used to cook with my Mom. That’s the name of the restaurant. Mom's. Possessive.
2) 35) dialog: I want the whole deal - I want the dead-on-my-feet-wake-up-and-I 'm- forty. I’ve spent my whole life chasing after things and knocking at doors and I’m tired of running towards people. I want to be the place that people COME to. I want to make a home for all the knockers and runners - I’m good at that. I'm happy with that. I keep the hearth. That’s a word, right? Hearth?
2) 37) dialog: Don’t I look like a cute smart graduate student?
2) 39) dialog: I tutor junior high because I didn’t get high enough SAT scores to do SAT tutoring, but you make way more money doing SAT. So, I’m taking the SAT’s AGAIN so I can make inroads into that racket.
2) 41) dialog: None of this will be necessary when the restaurant is up and running, but I’m good that way, curating my employment. Brooke is rifling through her purse.
2) 43) dialog: Oh! I thought you had to go back to school.
2) 45) dialog: Do you want to stay?
2) 47) dialog: Yeah, I’d invite you in but Peggy's Mom just got institutionalized for bi-polar disorder and shit’s pretty real upstairs. Tutoring is like 60% middle school math and 40% I know too much about them.
2) 49) dialog: You remember where my apartment is, go there. 35.
2) 51) dialog: And pick up some pasta, I’11 cook.
2) 68) dialog: X can be anything, any number, that is what’s CRAZY about X.
2) 70) dialog: Because X doesn’t roll like that, because X can’t be pinned down! It can be ANYTHING and we have to figure out what it is - crazy bastard. Peggy giggles and starts writing.
2) 72) dialog: Oh, honey, I’m sorry. I’m math only. INT. BROOKE’S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON Tracy unpacks an enormous amount of pasta onto the counte
2) 80) dialog: Nate dropped a gram on Instagram. That means a picture. Tracy smiles but less assuredly.
2) 82) dialog: It’s already got eighty likes. All his other recent pictures have like fifty likes. The extra thirty must be because of me.
2) 84) dialog: I know! Bob’s a real shutterbug. He made his own app. (to the bartender) Put it on... (very considered) ...this card.
2) 86) dialog: (ve: the drinks) Drop it in the glass and chug it. I'd love to get into the app business. I think my Dad met your Mom on the internet.
2) 88) dialog: Gross. But also I guess it’s pro forma now? (MORE )
2) 90) dialog: (Tracy nods) My Dad’s so strange. I’m sure he’s making her convert to Catholicism, right?
2) 92) dialog: He’s real Catholic now. It’s so boring, but it happened when my mom got sick. She was never that into it. He’s a geologist.
2) 94) dialog: It’s weird that someone who studies rocks can be really into Jesus.
2) 96) dialog: She was a special education teacher.
2) 98) dialog: She was really good at it. I still don’t like retarded jokes. Wanna see a picture of her? She hands Tracy her phone. Tracy smiles.
2) 101) dialog: (looking up) Hello. 40.
2) 103) dialog: Oh YEAH!
2) 105) dialog: Holy SHIT! Yeah! What are you doing in the city? You live here?
2) 107) dialog: Which one?
2) 109) dialog: Oh, that’s a piece of shit. And the girl who replaced the lead is AWFUL. (to Tracy) I used to run around with her. Well, she was older, is older.
2) 111) dialog: Let me buy you guys a drink what are you drinking?
2) 113) dialog: (laughs) What? 41.
2) 115) dialog: No! What did I do?
2) 117) dialog: (still genial) I don’t know what the FUCK you’re talking about! I always liked you.
2) 119) dialog: 
2) 122) dialog: Right! We did do that, didn’t we? We were weird.
2) 124) dialog: Whoa. WHOA.
2) 126) dialog: Everyone is an asshole in high school!
2) 128) dialog: I feel sorry for the thirteen year old girl that was you but I’m not sorry for you now.
2) 130) dialog: If I was thirteen I'd apologize to you but seeing as both of us are...in our twenties. I don’t see the need.
2) 132) dialog: Happy birthday.
2) 134) dialog: You’re welcome.
2) 136) dialog: Why?! You’re the one who hung onto a grudge for this fucking long! Do you know I didn’t even recognize you? I don’t say that to be mean, that’s the way it should be.
2) 138) dialog: You WERE bitter. That’s probably why it hurt you so much. Because it was true.
2) 140) dialog: (calling after) I don’t on you because I don’t CARE! And neither should you! 43.
2) 142) dialog: That’s so dramatic! What a drama queen. (scoffs) I can’t believe she lives in fucking Tenafly. What is she rich now? How dare she talk to me that way and be rich?
2) 144) dialog: I didn’t do what that girl said. I just wasn’t brought up that way. I should call Abe and see if he remembers. Brooke pulls out her phone.
2) 146) dialog: (nods, puts the phone away ) Yeah. I was so popular in high school but I didn’t try AT ALL. People just wanted to be friends with me. I didn’t even care about that stuff. When someone told me I was popular I was like “Really? Weird.”
2) 149) dialog: I’m going to shorten that, punch it up, and turn it into a tweet. Tracy throws up. Brooke immediately holds her hair back a comforts her.
2) 150) dialog: Oh no! Did I feed you too much liquor?
2) 152) dialog: We should get you a cab.
2) 156) dialog: Damn it...
2) 158) dialog: Argh...
2) 160) dialog: Fuck ME!
2) 162) dialog: 
2) 165) dialog: I FUCKING DON’T BELIEVE THIS SHIT MOTHER FUCKING SHIT. She kicks the door and screams.
2) 166) dialog: 
2) 168) dialog: Hey, Kareem, can we use your fire escape?
2) 170) dialog: Shit. I thought I left this window open.
2) 172) dialog: Why?!
2) 177) dialog: He’s pulling out of the restaurant. INT. TRACY’S DORM ROOM. NIGHT Tracy is on the bed, Brooke is on the floor in a makeshif bed. Tracy’s roommate, Ruth, looks annoyed and impressed. It’s dark.
2) 179) dialog: If I don’t have this money...my partners will bail, they’re in because Stavros was in. And they can go after my savings, everything... Rich people will take any excuse not to spend money - you can just see it in their eyes that they don’t really want to share life with you.
2) 181) dialog: The contractors need 20 thousand on Monday. And then there’s the key fee, that’s fifty - and then there are all these industrial refrigerators coming for another fifteen... I need whatever that equals by Monday. He was in for 200 thousand. Oh my fucking god.
2) 183) dialog: I already hit up every rich person I knew the first time around. This was well thought through, Tracy. 47.
2) 185) dialog: (suspicious) Do you secretly have money?
2) 187) dialog: (viciously) That's because they stopped caring about life just entirely, it’s not the same thing. My Mom died so don’t even fucking start with me about your pain. Ruth pipes up:
2) 189) dialog: Shut up, RUTH. Brooke sits up.
2) 190) dialog: I need some answers.
2) 193) dialog: I’m going to be worse off now than I was before I started trying to achieve stuff.
2) 195) dialog: No, you don’t. You can’t really know what it is to want things until you're at least thirty. And then with each passing year it gets more because the want is bigger and the possibility is less. Like how each passing year of your life feels faster because it is a smaller portion of your total life. Like that but in reverse. Everything becomes pure want.
2) 199) dialog: Who?
2) 201) dialog: Just tell me exactly what to do.
2) 206) dialog: Please, Tracy. (to the psychic) Mamie-Claire is my enemy. 49.
2) 208) dialog: No, no, it’s finished. Tell Spirit it’s finished.
2) 211) dialog: TRACY! Shut up. (to the Psychic) I never looked back.
2) 214) dialog: Well, to be fair, there are trees pretty much everywhere.
2) 216) dialog: (to the Psychic) Really? Can we get confirmation? Is Spirit sure of this?
2) 218) dialog: (re: Tracy) She’s not that young. Ten...ten to twelve years younger, we are contemporaries, okay?
2) 220) dialog: I’m so annoyed with Spirit.
2) 222) dialog: Right. I don’t want to be petty... I just wasn’t brought up that way. She's my nemesis, but she does owe me.
2) 224) dialog: Fuck this parade. I’m going to Greenwich.
2) 226) dialog: You ready for this, squirt? It’s going to get ugly.
2) 228) dialog: Great. How are we going to get there? INT. TONY’S CAR. DAY Brooke sits in the back seat with Nicolette. Tracy looks her phone and gives directions to Tony in the front.
2) 231) dialog: I‘1l bet Dylan is still in love with me. Marrying Mamie-Claire is like buying a cashmere sweater from Old Navy. Tony looks confused.
2) 233) dialog: It’s win win. Because I’m sure he still loves me.
2) 235) dialog: Calm down rich boy.
2) 237) dialog: Yes you are you have a car.
2) 239) dialog: (to Tracy) Sorry, I think I offended your boyfriend.
2) 241) dialog: (to Nicolette) Why are you here?
2) 243) dialog: But why did you come?
2) 245) dialog: ADULTERY? Why the fuck does it matter? You are all eighteen! Where is this old-person morality coming from? There is no “cheating” when you’re eighteen. You should all be touching each other all the time. CUT TO: Tracy zones out.
2) 251) dialog: (passing Tracy) You should be with him, not that goth housewife. 53.
2) 253) dialog: Only because you let him. You have to chase down the things you want.
2) 255) dialog: (considering her) Sometimes I don’t know if you are a zen master or a sociopath.
2) 257) dialog: You don’t give shit, do you? I’m so glad you’re on my team. Brooke wanders from the car and stretches. Tracy watches. Tracy watches Brooke, bent over, brushing out her hair fr the bottom, fixing her makeup.
2) 261) dialog: I have a visual memory of it. It’s kind of photographic.
2) 263) dialog: Well, I kind of stalked them once. I was so pissed.
2) 265) dialog: Yep, this is it. She starts to walk up to the house. Everyone follows her.
2) 266) dialog: Oh we're all going? Okay, we look crazy, but maybe that’s good. The four of them walk up to the house and ring the doorbe Wait. A man answers, forties.
2) 268) dialog: Hi, yes, I was wondering - is Mamie- Claire or Dylan in... I’m an old friend.
2) 270) dialog: Oh, which is their house? I never come here! I live in New York.
2) 281) dialog: Hello!
2) 283) dialog: (presenting everyone one by one) Tracy's Mom is marrying my Dad. Tony drove. Nicolette is jealous. Then a lot of unnecessary hand shaking takes place.
2) 290) dialog: Right, I want to change that... And I have something I really need to talk to you and Dylan about...
2) 292) dialog: Where is he?
2) 294) dialog: That’s okay. 57.
2) 296) dialog: We'll wait in the car.
2) 298) dialog: People wait in cars.
2) 307) dialog: It’s really fucking nice.
2) 312) dialog: Apparently, she got recruited by Tufts for crew and went but then NEVER did it. I mean, that’s the kind of person she is, just sly and shitty.
2) 314) dialog: Yeah, I would too, but it wouldn’t be like my CHARACTER. It would just be something I did.
2) 316) dialog: I don’t know! CUT TO: Brooke and Tracy wait in the kitchen. They’ve eat all the snacks. They’re bored. Brooke looks at her phone.
2) 317) dialog: I didn’t know you could change the font setting - I hate Helvetica. Mamie-Claire enters and places plates in the sink. Brooke stands immediately.
2) 318) dialog: You look amazing.
2) 320) dialog: They aren't “kids.” If they’re kids, we are.
2) 322) dialog: I really need to talk to you...
2) 324) dialog: How long will Dylan be “giving back” at the old folks home? I’d also like to talk to him.
2) 326) dialog: Oh, come on, Mamie-Claire, that’s stupid, you aren’t REALLY busy.
2) 331) dialog: Than what?
2) 348) dialog: Sorry, I got started on the wrong foot there - I meant to say, I’ve been missing you as a friend and...
2) 351) dialog: And I wanted to bring it to you and Dylan as a peace offering. I really think you’re going to want to hear about this... 62.
2) 353) dialog: Which is why I am bringing you this exciting business opportunity! Mamie-Claire goes into the dining room. Tracy nods at her like “keep going!” They follow Mamie-Claire.
2) 354) dialog: I would like to offer you a share in a restaurant I’m starting.
2) 356) dialog: Because it is all set up and ready to go and I already have the ability to draw a crowd and it'll just be... perfect. You'll love it. So will Dylan.
2) 358) dialog: But not so many that it would dilute your investment.
2) 360) dialog: Well, there was a slight snafu with one of our people which allowed a very coveted spot to open up, which I am offering only to you guys... Mamie-Claire considers.
2) 362) dialog: Why? 63.
2) 366) dialog: It’s just money, you don’t have to do any of the work, you just get the glory and the profit and the satisfaction of being involved with something awesome.
2) 368) dialog: I don’t want to overstep my bounds here but I think you might be wrong - when is he coming back?
2) 370) dialog: No, you cannot “just say no.” Why not?
2) 372) dialog: The money means NOTHING to you! Look at all this shit, this house that patio furniture. You can spare it, you wouldn’t even miss it!
2) 375) dialog: Yes, I can because you OWE me.
2) 378) dialog: For Dylan because that was just skanky but really for the T-shirts - you stole my T-shirt idea and you know it.
2) 380) dialog: No! That’s so wrong - I remember like the minute I said “what if this flower was, like, TOUGH.” And then we started riffing but I SAID IT FIRST.
2) 382) dialog: You are so annoying when you get calm voice! Brooke storms off into the backyard. Stops short when she sees two cats.
2) 383) dialog: Are these my fucking cats?!
2) 385) dialog: Did my cats die and you didn’t tell me? Are these replacement cats? 65.
2) 418) dialog: Hey Dad - what’s up? I can’t really talk right now.
2) 420) dialog: I‘1l1 call you tomorrow, I’m in the middle of something.
2) 422) dialog: -- I care about things! Tears run 68.
2) 424) dialog: Oh, really?
2) 426) dialog: Yeah.
2) 428) dialog: Sure, sure.
2) 430) dialog: Yes, I just... You’re really not doing it? I thought you guys were really symbiotic. Wasn’t it a web algorithm that got you together? She seems amazing.
2) 432) dialog: Through you, I met her. I don’t know, Dad. Come on... down Brooke's face.
2) 433) dialog: Don’t just bail. That’s what the Cardinases always do, move on to something else. Hang in there.
2) 435) dialog: (wiping her face) I have to go. (MORE )
2) 437) dialog: I have a really important business meeting. I love you.
2) 439) dialog: Nah, I'll probably just end up doing something depressing but young.
2) 441) dialog: Is it? Just kidding, it is. There is a silence between them for a second.
2) 442) dialog: So what does this make me and Tracy?
2) 444) dialog: Never mind.
2) 499) dialog: Tracy--
2) 502) dialog: Hey Dylan. They stand apart almost shyly.
2) 505) dialog: (smiling at Dylan) In a minute.
2) 515) dialog: I know, right?
2) 517) dialog: We were--
2) 519) dialog: No, I don’t “need money” - I come to you with an opportunity.
2) 522) dialog: (coyly) It’s a good one. 76.
2) 533) dialog: They’re my friends.
2) 536) dialog: I can’t wait to tell you about it. Mamie-Claire reenters, realizing no one followed.
2) 544) dialog: I do./I do.
2) 552) dialog: Because you’re into cool things.
2) 575) dialog: I'm starting a restaurant.
2) 577) dialog: That’s awesome for you. I never went to college.
2) 579) dialog: I know that.
2) 590) dialog: What?
2) 595) dialog: Records are so warm. Brooke is suddenly yanked out of the line of people, by M Claire who stands in the dark in the guest bathroom:
2) 598) dialog: Umm, well...it’s a restaurant, but also like where you cut hair... (hesitates) Can I start over?
2) 600) dialog: Okay, great. She does a weird “rewinding” type action. Everyone stares
2) 601) dialog: I was, that was pretend rewind. Like... Then she does it again.
2) 602) dialog: (breath) So...it would have big heavy wooden tables and chairs and... Suddenly a projection of the red FBI warning from a DVD appears across Brooke’s body. She hesitates. Dylan pulls the remote control from under his body.
2) 604) dialog: Umm... It would feel like the home everyone wishes they had been raised in. It...it...it...it. 83. Brooke is struggling. Tracy can’t help but pipe in from t couch.
2) 608) dialog: Loaves of bread that people tear off pieces. It would be the kind of place where at 2AM the chef and the wait-staff would come out and eat something simple they fixed themselves with the remaining guests and open a bottle of good wine.
2) 610) dialog: We would resist doing too many pieces in the Times and stuff because we'd want it to stay honest. They would want us to expand and open another one and Maybe we eventually would but we wouldn't try to re-create the first one, it would be a totally new thing. And if I ever had kids they would walk there after school and do their homework in a corner table. They’d grow up around all these wonderful adults -
2) 612) dialog: This could all be something you guys share in - you'd be their auntie and uncle - part of the life and food. And eventually I'd train someone younger than myself to run the day to day so I could go up to Maine with my family in the summers and have the kids dive for lobsters and everyone would be so warm and happy inside knowing that in their life they had participated in something that was only good. Tracy is kind of emotional. Everyone applauds. Karen is sobbing.
2) 616) dialog: Really?
2) 619) dialog: Tracy is spiritual guidance and waitress. 85.
2) 621) dialog: I hear everything.
2) 623) dialog: It’s 200 total but I calculated we need forty-two point five on Monday.
2) 630) dialog: I think a dime is a thousand. (cutting to the chase) Nevermind, you'd do that?
2) 667) dialog: Thanks.
2) 669) dialog: If I could figure out how to amass and hoard money, I'd do it. 89.
2) 671) dialog: Yeah, no, I’m over that now. Dylan laughs. He moves toward her. She moves in.
2) 673) dialog: I know I’m funny. There’s nothing I don’t know about myself. That’s why I can’t do therapy. They’re close now. He pushes a strand out of her face and behind her ear. Brooke is going with it.
2) 675) dialog: Oh...you guys see a therapist? Like a tune up?
2) 677) dialog: Your couple’s therapist said that?
2) 679) dialog: (sadly) Mamie-Claire said you were trying to have kids.
2) 681) dialog: Oh no, I’m sorry-- 90.
2) 683) dialog: (freaked out) Yay...
2) 685) dialog: Oh...do I? Which party? Sometimes I look like I have fat arms. He takes another step forward.
2) 687) dialog: (tearful) Thank you. She hugs him. He holds the hug too long. She has to yank herself free.
2) 690) dialog: (almost inaudible) Williamsburg.
2) 694) dialog: (crushed) You're giving me money to not start a restaurant?
2) 696) dialog: Not if it was successful --
2) 699) dialog: No. No, it isn’t. Brooke hesitates. Dylan grins. Tracy enters.
2) 702) dialog: (shaking off her disappointment ) Yes... Dylan made a proposition.
2) 712) dialog: (trying to be brave) No... I won’t do the restaurant now. It’s just gotten too crazy.
2) 716) dialog: He’s right. I think I even feel a little relieved.
2) 723) dialog: You know what, I appreciate it, Dylan, Mamie-Claire, but I’m not going to take the money. I/’11 figure something else out.
2) 725) dialog: I just wasn’t brought up that way. Mamie-Claire smiles at her. An unspoken “Thanks.” Tracy comes over to Brooke.
2) 727) dialog: I'll figure it out. I always do. 94.
2) 735) dialog: Guys!
2) 742) dialog: Chill the fuck out.
2) 749) dialog: What the fuck is that?
2) 760) dialog: (to Tracy) You wrote a story about me?
2) 763) dialog: I'd like to read it. If it’s about me.
2) 768) dialog: (not thrilled with this) Funny? What does it say?
2) 771) dialog: Gimme that story. She snatches it out of Nicolette’s hands. CUT TO: Brooke reads with Mamie-Claire, Karen, Harold and Dylan all reading over her shoulder. Tony and Nicolette a hover in the background, reading here and there. Tracy watches nervously from across the room. Brooke starts to turn the page. Everyone indicates they’r not finished with that page yet. CUT TO: Brooke turns the final page. She looks at Tracy. She is FURIOUS.
2) 773) dialog: (shaking with fury) You don’t get to decide what’s hurtful and not hurtful.
2) 775) dialog: You wrote this after ONE night with me? ONE?!
2) 777) dialog: You think I’m a rotting carcass? That I’m doomed to failure???
2) 779) dialog: So much of this “fiction” did NOT happen this way. Karen, you’re a lawyer. I’m going to sue you until you have NOTHING.
2) 781) dialog: No, this isn’t your life!
2) 783) dialog: NO! I was going to have that night anyway, you never were!
2) 785) dialog: You joined my life - you needed a place to go and I invited you in and then you stole my life. You’re a LEECH. A BLOODSUCKER.
2) 787) dialog: I DIDN’T ASK FOR YOU. Tracy looks for support from Tony and Nicolette. 99.
2) 789) dialog: I DON’T GIVE A SHIT BECAUSE I AM NOT A FRIEND OF TENNESSEE WILLIAMS.
2) 791) dialog: That's different! You were right there! You knew I was Twittering, it wasn’t some sneaky shitty thing - do you want me to credit you? Or no I‘ll just delete it.
2) 793) dialog: It’s my least popular tweet anyway!
2) 795) dialog: You are much more of an asshole than you initially appear.
2) 797) dialog: (looking again at the story) And...you think I haven't dealt with the pain of my mother’s death? I deal with it all the time, I talk about it all the time.
2) 801) dialog: 
2) 813) dialog: She’s not done, bitch!
2) 816) dialog: No you just portray women as crazy desperate gold diggers!
2) 818) dialog: Of COURSE it’s possible, I am the MOST sensitive person...
2) 820) dialog: (wailing) Mamie-Claire!
2) 838) dialog: Guess what, bitch? My dad isn’t going to marry your slutty atheist mother so we’re not sisters. We never will be. We’re nothing to each other. Mamie-Claire tucks her folded paper into Tracy’s pocket.
2) 903) dialog: Hi.
2) 906) dialog: In a couple of hours. I’m going to try my luck out west.
2) 908) dialog: New York isn’t the New York I used to know. There’s too much construction. Maybe LA is my lady. In LA I qualify as well-read.
2) 910) dialog: I know you’re sorry.
2) 912) dialog: You're not?
2) 914) dialog: Oh then fuck this. Brooke opens the window again.
2) 916) dialog: I’ve been around.
2) 918) dialog: Yeah. Mamie-Claire gave me what would have been my share of our T- shirt profits. It was just enough to pay off my debts and get out of town.
2) 920) dialog: I don’t know. I think I’m sick. And I don’t know if my ailment has a name - it’s just me sitting and staring at the internet or the television for long periods of time interspersed by trying to not do that and then lying about what I’ve been doing. Then I’1l get so excited about something that the excitement overwhelms me and I can’t sleep or do anything - and then I just am in love with everything but can’t figure out how to make myself work in the world.
2) 922) dialog: I wish we lived in feudal times when your position in the world couldn’t change. If you were a king or a peasant you had to just be happy with who you were. (pause) But...wait! Brooke looks inside an open box. She finds a piece of pap and hands it to Tracy. CLOSE: SAT results. 2200.
2) 924) dialog: Well, I thought I might actually go to college. I’m not an amputee.
2) 926) dialog: I filled out a couple of applications. I wrote my college essay all about you.
2) 928) dialog: Oh snap! No. It’s about my mom. But I had you there.
2) 930) dialog: I let Mamie-Claire and Dylan keep the cats. It’s like, I gave thema chance for a better life, better than I could have provided for them.
2) 932) dialog: Don’t put that in a story. Not because I care but because it’s not a very good observation. Tracy sees the Mobius Literary Journal (the one with her story) inside an open box. She’s about to say something, thinks better of it. Brooke reenters and tosses books int the box.
2) 934) dialog: This won’t even be your big “college story.”
2) 936) dialog: Well, thanks for stopping by, but I have more packing to do before Kareem and I break down the front door.
2) 938) dialog: Yeah. Tracy moves toward the window. She looks back at her frie
