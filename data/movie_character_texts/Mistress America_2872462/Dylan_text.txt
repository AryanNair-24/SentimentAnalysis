2) 666) dialog: I have to say, I’m impressed Brooke. It takes a lot of moxie to start a restaurant.
2) 668) dialog: You're doing it, babe. You’re out there, doing something besides amassing and hoarding money.
2) 670) dialog: You could have married me or a dozen other guys but you wanted to be your own person.
2) 672) dialog: You’re funny because you don’t know you’re funny.
2) 674) dialog: MC and I see a woman in New Haven.
2) 676) dialog: More like a death watch. She’s totally on my side. She basically thinks Mamie-Claire is holding me back and I should just leave her.

2) 689) dialog: We'll put it up for rent immediately, cool neighborhood?
2) 691) dialog: Oh, come on! The coolest. Yeah, we'll turn it over no problem. (MORE )
2) 693) dialog: Because let’s face it having a restaurant is like having a kid with a drug problem. It’s...just...it’s really draining.
2) 695) dialog: First of all - I’m saving you. If you started the restaurant, you’d be back here in a year asking for five times this.
2) 697) dialog: What are the odds? He pushes a hair away from her face. He’s close to her no
2) 698) dialog: You’re as beautiful as ever. Whatever you're doing it’s working.
2) 701) dialog: We'll have to, because some celebrating is in order. (putting his arm around Brooke ) I think we may have reached a deal.
2) 703) dialog: I’m going to give her money immediately. 92.
2) 706) dialog: Who was at the door?
2) 708) dialog: Where’s Karen?
2) 710) dialog: I’m not giving her 200 grand, don’t worry, I'm just bailing her out of her current situation. Tracy looks at Brooke.
2) 714) dialog: (to Tracy) You believe in her, don’t you? Tracy nods. Brooke watches her.
2) 715) dialog: This is a good result, this is even better than getting the restaurant. Less financial uncertainty. 93.
2) 718) dialog: Well, I don’t think anyone starts anything with the dream of NOT making money.
2) 721) dialog: It’s my money. I make it. I can do what I want with it. Just like, you have your T-shirt money, you can do what you want with that.
2) 724) dialog: Why? Brooke looks at Mamie-Claire.
2) 743) dialog: Ladies, ladies.
2) 755) dialog: Who wouldn’t want to write a story about Brooke?
