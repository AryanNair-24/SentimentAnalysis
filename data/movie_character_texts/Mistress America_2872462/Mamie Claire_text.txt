2) 219) text: You must seek out Mamie-Claire.
2) 272) dialog: Harold.
2) 274) dialog: I don’t know Harold, watching kiddie porn?
2) 276) dialog: So sorry we interfered with your kiddie-porn.
2) 278) dialog: Obviously!
2) 282) dialog: What - what are you doing here? Who are these people? 56.
2) 285) dialog: I’m Mamie-Claire. They shake.
2) 287) dialog: Mamie-Claire. They shake.
2) 289) dialog: I thought we weren’t speaking.
2) 291) dialog: Dylan isn’t here.
2) 293) dialog: (hesitates) He volunteers at a retirement community. I’m in the middle of... (hesitates again) It’s a thing we do. It’s like a party.
2) 295) dialog: No... it’s not... (getting flustered, then clarifying firmly) It’s not for you to say okay, it’s for me to say okay.
2) 297) dialog: No, that’s weird.
2) 299) dialog: (sighs) You and your... “posse” can hang out in the kitchen.
2) 304) dialog: I don’t know if you're hungry, but this is for if you’re hungry. 58.
2) 306) dialog: Thank you. Brooke frowns, looking around.
2) 308) dialog: Thank you.
2) 310) dialog: (confused) Yeah, I guess. This week’s book is Faulkner's “The Hamlet.” Followed by a kind of junky biography of Derrida, but it’s fun.
2) 319) dialog: Why are all these kids with you?
2) 323) dialog: Okay, how long do you think you'll need with me, because -
2) 325) dialog: We're both very busy, I have an appointment after this...
2) 327) dialog: Yes! I am!
2) 329) dialog: We started a community farm. We have goats.
2) 334) dialog: Excuse me, I have to see my guests out. 60. Tony and Nicolette follow Mamie-Claire to the kitchen doo
2) 341) dialog: (confused by who he even is) Yes. A pregnant woman sits by the door with her bag in her lap
2) 349) dialog: And?
2) 352) dialog: The last time I saw you you were hiding in the bushes and then you started incoherently yelling at me and my husband about how we had ruined your life and the time before that you were throwing up at my wedding.
2) 355) dialog: Why?
2) 359) dialog: So why are you here?
2) 361) dialog: It’s not really a good time for me to get involved with a business...
2) 363) dialog: We're trying to have a baby...
2) 365) dialog: Thanks, Karen.
2) 367) dialog: I don’t think Dylan would buy into it. We recently lost money purchasing taxi cab medallions.
2) 369) dialog: I really need to focus on having children - this isn’t part of what I need to focus on. No, just... Can I just say no? Brooke gets furious.
2) 371) dialog: I don’t need a why.
2) 374) dialog: No. You can’t make me. 64.
2) 377) dialog: (evenly) I don’t owe you.
2) 379) dialog: I did not steal your idea. It was my idea and you were there when I had it.
2) 381) dialog: (calmly) No, you didn’t. Brooke screams.
2) 384) dialog: They're mine. I paid for their cat surgery so they’re mine.
2) 386) dialog: No! They are the same goddamn cats! Brooke stares at the cats hard and then stomps outside. Tracy wants to go after her but follows Mamie-Claire into living room. Tony and Nicolette play chess. The pregnant woman still s by the door checking her phone periodically. Tony thinks hard before a move. He moves his rook--
2) 391) dialog: Karen, come inside, have a glass of wine.
2) 394) dialog: No, I don’t deny it. She’s right. The T-shirts were her idea.
2) 396) dialog: I like making her mad. It’s so easy. 66.
2) 398) dialog: No, I tried to include her. I set up a meeting with people and she never showed up. And then she stopped speaking to me when me and Dylan got married so I figured I could just go do it.
2) 400) dialog: No... She is right that I stole a lot of her life ideas. I really am not as creative as she is. But she never would have used them. She has no follow through.
2) 402) dialog: Obviously. That’s always true.
2) 412) dialog: I couldn’t be your mother, thank god.
2) 414) dialog: Fuck you.
2) 416) dialog: Sorry, Karen.
2) 474) dialog: 
2) 477) dialog: I’m just trying to hug you.
2) 479) dialog: It’s nice....
2) 481) dialog: I want you to share it with me.
2) 485) dialog: (pouting) Fine. Dylan looks up -- he clocks Tony, Tracy and Karen, the abandoned Pregnant Woman, at the top of the stairs.
2) 488) dialog: Of course, Karen. She goes to retrieve a glass.
2) 503) dialog: Brooke’s here with some kindergartners.
2) 512) dialog: Karen! 75. Karen sits on the stool. Tony looks distraught.
2) 518) dialog: Brooke needs money.
2) 520) dialog: I told her about the taxi medallions.
2) 523) dialog: We're having dinner at the Baskins. I’m sorry to say it but you guys will have to leave now. Tony holds up a Chipwich.
2) 525) dialog: 
2) 528) dialog: Didn’t you guys park over at Harold's?
2) 530) dialog: They don’t!
2) 532) dialog: They’re not her students. It’s much weirder than that. (definitively) I’11 walk you out. Mamie-Claire leaves through the door toward the living ro No one follows.
2) 537) dialog: Dylan, let’s not do this. She already lost her shit once.
2) 539) dialog: Brooke, this is uncomfortable. Dylan doesn’t want to do this.
2) 543) dialog: No one wants to hear about your glory days in college radio, Dylan, OK.
2) 546) dialog: I’ve gotten really into triathalons. 78.
2) 549) dialog: No, I only like cycling when it’s combined with running and swimming.
2) 551) dialog: Because we “owe” her!
2) 555) dialog: You've just said “weed” like fifteen times.
2) 557) dialog: NO! No one has touched it. It should be next to the Chipwiches. CUT TO: Tony knocks on the upstairs bathroom door. He’s eating a Chipwich.
2) 583) dialog: (nearly apoplectic) Nobody knows how to make an apple bong! Tony comes back:
2) 596) dialog: (intense whisper) I want you to know that I really love Dylan. I love his blonde hair and his beard. I know you only loved him for his money but I love him as a person and I also love him for his money but not in that order. I’m committed to being a happier person. Do you understand? She releases Brooke back out into the hallway. 82.
2) 628) dialog: I thought “stacks” meant a hundred.
2) 635) dialog: Dylan, this is really something for us to talk about privately.
2) 638) dialog: Can it wait, Karen?
2) 641) dialog: Harold--
2) 644) dialog: I don’t know!
2) 646) dialog: (yelling) I’m blowing Harold so he doesn’t call the cops. JK. I’m probably just going to have to go look at his boat collection. 87.
2) 648) dialog: I don’t think you’ve ever been over here, Harold.
2) 650) dialog: That’s when we made an effort.
2) 705) dialog: You're giving her money? Mamie-Claire enters. Dylan takes his arm off of Brooke.
2) 707) dialog: Harold. He’s giving himself a tour of the house.
2) 709) dialog: I don’t fucking know. You're giving her money??? This is our decision. Not yours.
2) 720) dialog: Why would you give her money?
2) 722) dialog: But I... we’re married. This is our life. Brooke looks at Tracy.
2) 738) dialog: Please stop it! Brooke helps Mamie-Claire pull Nicolette off Tracy. 95.
2) 745) dialog: (to Karen) Is that a real thing?
2) 754) dialog: This is so nerdy.
2) 756) dialog: (vaising her hand) Me. I wouldn't.
2) 765) dialog: (to Dylan) You don’t read fiction. 97.
2) 805) dialog: The emotional betrayal I can’t speak to -
2) 807) dialog: But I can say that you portray women terribly. And because of that. Mamie-Claire refers to her piece of neatly folded paper.
2) 808) dialog: I’ve prepared some questions I'd like you to think about.
2) 810) dialog: And I want you to answer these questions, not for our satisfaction, but for your own. (gazing at her paper) One: Do you believe in the women’s right to choose?
2) 812) dialog: Excuse me, I’m not done. 101.
2) 814) dialog: Brooke, please. Two: What do you think someone who bombs abortion clinics would think of your story?
2) 819) dialog: To your own feelings.
2) 821) dialog: Sorry, I don’t really think that, it’s just something I would have said at one time.
2) 826) dialog: You must call the Lit Society and tell them you’re withdrawing your essay--
2) 828) dialog: This cannot appear in print or online. Karen, will you represent Brooke?
2) 830) dialog: Will you draw up a contract, please?
2) 839) dialog: There are ten questions there. All equally important for you to answer.
