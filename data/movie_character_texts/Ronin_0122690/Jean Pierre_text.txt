61) 3) dialog: Are you sure you won't have a drink?
61) 9) text: Take that sponge and wipe away as much of the blood as you can, keep it clean so I can see. Jean-Pierre does as Sam says, wiping away the blood that keeps filling the wound.

64) 9) dialog: Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
64) 11) dialog: Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.

64) 28) dialog: Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you. (beat)
64) 31) dialog: You seem one to me.
64) 33) text: The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival. LONG BEAT.  Something in Sam's speech touches Jean-Pierre He relaxes his finger on the hammer.
64) 34) dialog: Survival.  I suppose that's as good a cause as any. BACK ON Vincent - Who relaxes his grip on his gun. BACK O Sam and Jean-Pierre - And we're PULLING BACK, AWAY from t Farmhouse, which glows in the morning sun as we -
