Larry and Swe open theirs and stare at the wads of Franc Notes stuffed inside.  Even Gregor cracks his envelope and peaks at his money.  But neither Vincent nor Sam takes a look.

He slips behind her and suddenly they square off in earnest.  The previous martial arts stuff was a kind of choreographed exercise, but now - They spar for real -- they never hit another, but they come awfully close, hands and feet whiz through the air, throwing rapid-fire combinations and techniques.  They're not angry, but they're not kidding, either.  Finally - Deirdre feints a punch that distracts Sam's attention from - The KICK she throws right behind h punch, and she smiles as - WHUMP!  Sam wasn't distracted all -- he drops to the ground beneath her kick and catche her standing leg with a sweep which takes her to the grou and now - She's trapped beneath him.
