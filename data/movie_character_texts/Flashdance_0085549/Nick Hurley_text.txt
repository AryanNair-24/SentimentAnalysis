The SIX PRINCIPLE WAITRESSES are rocking to the music while carrying trays of draft beer. Occasionally they will put the trays down to do some impromptu flashdancing between tables. CAMERA HOLDS on PAUL POTOKER, dressed in an expensive suit, sipping a scot, watching RAVEN dance. Her look is more sophisticated this time. We see C/I choreographed ge seen earlier at the CONSERVATORY. She's halfway through her dance, moving her costume around. The MUSIC takes a turn from jazz to rock.and roll. PAUL astonished as RAVEN starts to literally rip the dress she's wearing to shreds exposing a Bilver-sequined tank top. The dress is made of a particular kind of disposable material. RAVEN moves into what appears to be balletic twirls and twists and we finally see the move seen previously in Olitski's Gym. Her hair trails across: the ground and her face moves up between her legs, undulates, swoops into another series of moves, The bar goes wild when RAVEN ascends to the dressing room. PAUL is stunned. HOWARD approaches PAUL.
