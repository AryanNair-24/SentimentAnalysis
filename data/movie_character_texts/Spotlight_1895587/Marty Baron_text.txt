7) 1) text: Marty sits at a table reading “The Curse of the Bambino,” NOTEPAD beside him.
7) 4) dialog: Thanks for taking time out of your weekend, Robby.
7) 6) dialog: ‘The Curse of the Bambino.’
7) 8) dialog: Thank you. Uh, to be honest, I’m not much of a baseball fan. I’m just trying to get a feel for city. Are you originally from Boston?
7) 10) dialog: And did that change at all after the paper was sold to the Times?
7) 12) dialog: Good. (then) So, you're an editor for, uh, the Spotlight team?
7) 14) dialog: No. Not particularly.
7) 16) dialog: What are you working on now?
7) 18) dialog: How long does that typically take?
7) 21) dialog: A couple of months.
7) 24) dialog: Not necessarily. Uh, but from what I understand readership is down, the Internet is cutting into the Classified business and, uh, I think, uh, I’m going to have to take a hard look at things.
7) 26) dialog: I would assume so, yes, but what I’m more focused on right now is finding a way to make this paper essential to its readers.
7) 28) dialog: Fair enough. I just think we can do better. Off Robby --
8) 0) text: The front of the Globe. Marty gets out of a cab, shuts th door. He walks inside.
10) 0) text: Editors around a horseshoe table, side seats filled. It’s QUIET, nervous eyes on Marty, who reads some notes. Ben a editor HELEN DONOVAN, 50s, to either side. Robby sits off the side, WATCHING.
10) 2) dialog: Uh, sure. (to the group) Hello. As most of you know by now, my name is Marty Baron, I’m delighted to be here. If you can tell me your name as we go around, that would be helpful. Marty looks back to his notes.
12) 4) dialog: Is that everyone?
12) 6) dialog: Great, thank you. Uh, did everyone read Eileen McNamara’s column this weekend? The room reacts. Huh? Editors look at EILEEN MCNAMARA, 50
12) 8) dialog: Yes, what’s the folo on that?
12) 10) dialog: Well, apparently this priest molested kids in six different parishes over the last thirty years and the attorney for the victims, Mr...
12) 12) dialog: Thanks, Eileen. Mr. Garabedian says Cardinal Law found out about it fifteen years ago and did nothing.
12) 15) dialog: Whether Mr. Garabedian is a crank or not, he says he has documents that prove the Cardinal knew.
12) 17) dialog: Okay, but the fact remains, we have a Boston priest abused 80 kids, we've got a lawyer who says he has proof Law knew about it, and we've written all of... (checking his notes) ...two stories on this in the last six months? (then) This strikes me as an essential story for a local paper. At the very least, we should be going after those documents.
12) 19) dialog: Well, I don’t know what the laws are here, but in Florida we would go to court. Robby raises an eyebrow. In fact, the whole room does.
12) 21) dialog: Technically we wouldn't sue the Church. We would file a motion to lift the seal on those documents.
12) 23) dialog: Good to know. 11/26/14 14. Off Robby, intrigued -- 17 INT. GLOBE, BEN’S OFFICE - LATER 17 Ben and Robby walk into Ben’s office.
12) 41) text: Ben and Robby enter. Marty’s on the phone.
12) 42) dialog: Okay, thank you. Yes. Okay, thanks. Marty hangs up as they sit.
12) 43) dialog: I set up a meeting for tomorrow with outside counsel...
12) 45) dialog: Yeah.
12) 47) dialog: Uh, Constance Sweeney.
12) 49) dialog: Why’s that?
12) 51) dialog: Judging from what I’ve read, it doesn’t seem like we’ve done a thorough investigation of the Geoghan case. Is that right?
12) 53) dialog: Okay, but, uh, just so I understand, beyond our daily coverage, we haven't committed any long term investigative resources to the question of whether or not Cardinal Law knew about this?
12) 55) dialog: (to Robby) And that’s the kind of thing your team does?
12) 57) dialog: Could you set it aside?
12) 60) dialog: Would you consider picking this one?
13) 30) dialog: Excuse me, do you know where the Publisher’s office is? The employee points. Marty heads that direction. INT. GLOBE, PUBLISHER’S OFFICE - DAY 24 RICHARD GILMAN, 50s, Brooks Brothers suit, finishes a cal Marty is sitting on a couch in large, plush office opposi
13) 32) dialog: Yes, I think so.
13) 34) dialog: I'd like to challenge the protective order in the Geoghan case.
13) 39) dialog: We're just filing a motion. But yes.
13) 41) dialog: Yes. I do.
13) 43) dialog: Uh, I think they'll be interested. Gilman considers for a long moment, looks unsettled.
13) 46) dialog: They already have. It’s set up for next week.
29) 22) text: An Audi A4 pulls up in a large parking lot. Marty gets ou looks up at the Cardinal’s MASSIVE LAKE STREET MANSION.
30) 1) text: Mahogany bookshelves, leather furniture. CARDINAL LAW, large, 50s, wears a collar and sits across from Marty.
30) 3) dialog: I, uh, read you were an editor once. Law chuckles.
30) 5) dialog: How so? 49
30) 9) dialog: I can imagine.
30) 11) dialog: Uh, thank you. Personally I’m of the opinion that for the paper to best perform its function it needs to, uh, stand alone. Law reacts, surprised -- the rebuff almost feels unwarran
30) 13) text: Marty gets into to his car. He sits, unwraps the gift. A thick book, THE CATECHISM OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. Off Mar
34) 0) text: Ben and Robby walk. Robby sees Marty in his office, worki
43) 3) dialog: Uh, Baron? B-A-R-O-N.
43) 6) dialog: Uh, thank you.
43) 8) dialog: Uh, yes. We did.
44) 1) text: Marty walks into the party, not knowing a soul. He stands alone, taking it in.
44) 3) dialog: Uh, to be honest, these events aren’t really my strong suit. (then) Are you involved with the charity? 11/26/14 66.
44) 5) dialog: It’s hard to miss.
44) 8) dialog: We've met.
44) 10) dialog: No, but he did give me a copy of the Catechism.
44) 12) dialog: How did that play out?
58) 56) dialog: When did you get this?
58) 58) dialog: Where are we on Law? Anything that shows he had knowledge of this?
58) 60) dialog: I keep thinking about that conversation we had the other night. You said Law called down the power of God when we reported on Porter.
58) 62) dialog: Okay, but I checked the clips, Porter wasn’t even in the Boston Archdiocese. He was in Fall River. So, why the extreme reaction?
58) 66) dialog: I think that’s the bigger story. The team reacts. Robby watches.
58) 68) dialog: If it came from the top down, yes.
58) 70) dialog: That’s all they do, indicate.
58) 72) dialog: We'll get into the same cat fight you got into on Porter, which made a lot of noise but changed things not one bit. We need to focus on the institution not the individual priests. Practice and policy. Show me the Church manipulated the system so that these guys wouldn’t have to face charges. Show me they put those same priests back into parishes, time and time again. Show me this was systemic, that it came from the top down. Beat. Pretty fucking clear.
58) 74) dialog: We're going after the system.
71) 1) text: Marty gets out of his car and walks toward the building. a beautiful September morning.
72) 1) text: It’s pretty empty. Marty walks in, heads toward his offic but slows when SOMETHING on a TV catches his attention. H walks to the TV, joins A YOUNG REPORTER already watching.
72) 2) dialog: What happened?
72) 4) dialog: Tell Linda to get every reporter we have in here now.
75) 11) dialog: Sure. Marty turns as Ben walks in.
75) 13) dialog: Okay. Sounds right. Ben starts to leave when -- 11/26/14 103.
75) 14) dialog: Ben. (then) I, uh, wanted to say thank you for taking the lead on 9/11. All the politics at Logan and Massport, I wasn’t the person to do it. You’ve done an excellent job over the last six weeks. Ben is completely caught off guard.
75) 16) dialog: Good night.
94) 22) text: Marty, Ben, Robby, and Canellos (the Metro editor we met earlier) sit with the Globe lawyer, Albano. 11/26/14 120.
94) 24) dialog: And when would we get the documents?
94) 26) dialog: Okay. Thanks, John. And nice work. Albano exits.
94) 31) dialog: Why’s that?
94) 35) dialog: When did you --
94) 40) dialog: These are substantial. They clearly show that Law was negligent. Ben and Marty stare at Robby. A beat, then --
94) 46) dialog: How? These clearly show he knew and did nothing.
94) 50) dialog: You have multiple sources confirming the 70 priests?
94) 56) dialog: Will he go on the record?
94) 59) dialog: Okay. Tell Canellos to bury the ruling in Metro. (then, to Robby) You've got six weeks. 156 157
98) 13) dialog: Another adjective. Mike and Matt roll in.
98) 23) dialog: (writing) “The Church had no interest in knowing what the Globe’s questions would be.” (hands it to Mike) Work it in somewhere before the jump. (to the team) Anything else?
98) 26) dialog: Okay.
98) 33) dialog: I‘1l talk to Gilman about security and the phones. (to Robby) How’s it coming on the folo story? Robby looks to Sacha.
98) 35) dialog: All seventy?
98) 37) dialog: Robby, that source of yours, is this someone we could revisit?
98) 61) dialog: Uh, can I say something? They turn to him.
98) 62) dialog: Sometimes it’s easy to forget that we spend most of our time stumbling around in the dark. Suddenly a light gets turned on, and there's fair share of blame to go around. (then) I can’t speak to what happened before I arrived but all of you have done some very good reporting here, reporting that I believe is going to have an immediate and considerable impact on our readers. (then) For me, this kind of story is why we do this. The team takes this in.
98) 63) dialog: Having said that, Cardinal Law and the Catholic community are going to have a very strong response to this. So if you need to take a moment, you've earned it. But I will need you back here Monday morning focused and ready to do your job.
99) 2) text: Ben, coat on, sits alone in his office. MARTY (0.C. Leaving?
100) 1) text: Ben and Marty walk across the quiet press room.
100) 2) dialog: I just got a call from the Cardinal.
100) 4) dialog: He wanted to tell me personally that he had decided not to comment. He said he wanted to, uh, extend me that courtesy.
100) 6) dialog: I told him he was making a mistake. And that we were going to run the story.
