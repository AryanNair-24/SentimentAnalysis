17) 1) text: ERIC MACLEISH, 40s, good looks, quick with a story and a smile, walks into the posh room, finds Sacha and Robby.
17) 2) dialog: The famous Walter Robinson in my conference room. MacLeish and Robby shake hands. 11/26/14 22.
17) 4) dialog: Nice to meet you. Do you play golf?
17) 6) dialog: Good. Your colleague took some money off me at a charity event last year.
17) 8) dialog: So, how can I help you?
17) 10) dialog: Sure. Eighty plaintiffs. All individual cases, Garabedian must be swimming.
17) 12) dialog: Look, it’s tricky. You need to understand these are shitty cases. The statute of limitations is only 3 years and most of these victims don’t come forward until long after that.
17) 14) dialog: They're kids. Shame. Guilt. And they come from tough neighborhoods, nobody wants to admit this kind of thing. So you’re screwed on the time limit and even if you argue your way around that, the charitable immunity statute caps damages at twenty grand.
17) 16) dialog: That’s the way the system works. The Church is tough. So your best shot is to try these cases in the press like I did on Porter. But most victims want nothing to do with being on TV. And Mitch isn’t exactly a people person.
17) 18) dialog: Then he has a long road ahead of him. My guess? He doesn’t have anything on Law.
17) 20) dialog: I think he’s grandstanding to cut a better deal.
17) 22) dialog: Have you met Mitch Garabedian? INT. GARABEDIAN’S OFFICE - LATER 29 Mike, still waiting, checks his watch. He hears more YELL behind the door. Suddenly the door opens.

GARABEDIAN’S OFFICE, CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
41) 1) dialog: Thanks for waiting, so sorry guys, I got stuck on a call. What’s up?
41) 3) dialog: Yes, I’m familiar with him.
41) 5) dialog: As I’m sure you can understand, I can’t discuss that. 11/26/14 62.
41) 7) dialog: I can’t discuss that either. Come on, guys.
41) 9) dialog: Even if I’d been involved in those cases, the settlements would be confidential. I could be disbarred for acknowledging their existence. Robby’s not backing down. MacLeish shakes his head. ERIC MACLEISH (CONT’D) Look, I told you, these are tough cases. Most of these folks just want some acknowledgement of what happened. We got them a sit-down with the bishop and a little dough. It was the best they could hope for.
41) 11) dialog: No, the Church promised to take the priests out of circulation.
41) 13) dialog: (done with this) You guys need anything else?
41) 15) dialog: We dealt directly with the Church. We'd draw up a demand letter and we'd send it to the chancery. So that’s 11/26/14 63.
41) 17) dialog: It was a private mediation. ano. Jesus. Sacha and Robby react.
41) 19) dialog: Correct.

41) 23) dialog: (stonewalling him) No. No I don’t.
58) 1) text: Eric MacLeish and a colleague get off an elevator, head o MacLeish sees Robby and Sacha sitting in the lobby, waiti for him. As they stand, MacLeish turns to his colleague.

58) 7) dialog: You gotta be... I don’t have time for this crap. 11/26/14 80. He starts to move but Robby steps in his way, angrier tha Sacha’s ever seen.
58) 9) dialog: You know I can’t tell you, Robby.
58) 11) dialog: Are you threatening me? A beat. Robby controls himself, turns calm. Professional.
58) 13) dialog: I already sent you a list of names.
58) 15) dialog: The Globe. Years ago. After the Porter case, I got plenty of calls. I had 20 priests in Boston but I couldn't go after them without press. So I sent you guys a list of names and you buried it.
58) 17) dialog: Check your goddamn clips, Robby. Robby turns and leaves. Sacha follows. They walk a bit. 93 11/26/14 81.
