3) 1) text: A large newsroom. REPORTERS and EDITORS gathered. Boston, MA - July, 2001 DEPUTY MANAGING EDITOR BEN BRADLEE JR., 50s, gruff, stand front with an older reporter, STEWART, 60s. And a cake.
3) 2) dialog: Losing good reporters, it’s tough. And losing one of our best... well to put it as eloquently as I can, it’s a real kick in the ass. A few polite chuckles from those in the crowd.
3) 3) dialog: But Robby’s known Stewart longer than most of you have been alive so I’m gonna turn it over to him. Robby? Ben looks to WALTER ‘ROBBY’ ROBINSON, 55, Boston Everyman
9) 0) text: Ben strides across the newsroom. Robby falls in.
9) 2) dialog: Hey. Saw the email on the PD numbers. Looks interesting.
9) 4) dialog: How much longer you need?
9) 6) dialog: (realizing) Where are you going?
9) 8) dialog: You? Since when?
9) 10) dialog: Technically. Your sit-down with Baron go that well?
9) 12) dialog: That’s a first.
9) 14) dialog: (shrugs ) He’s a barrel of laughs.

12) 3) dialog: When’s the Pats opener? Except Marty.
12) 9) dialog: It’s a column, what kind of folo were you thinking?
12) 16) dialog: As I understand it, those documents are under seal. Silence. No one knows what to do. Robby watches.
12) 20) dialog: You want to sue the church?
12) 22) dialog: The church will read that as us suing them. So will everybody else.
12) 25) dialog: That’s one word for it.
12) 27) dialog: I think Gilman’s gonna shit a brick. Knock. Knock. Mike’s at the door.
12) 29) dialog: Door. Mike shuts the door, looks at Robby.
12) 33) dialog: We covered Geoghan when the story broke three years ago. Baron was still in Miami.
12) 35) dialog: He wasn’t here.
12) 38) dialog: And what parish he belongs to. Ben’s phone RINGS. Ben picks it up.
12) 39) dialog: Bradlee. Yeah. Okay. (hanging up, to Robby) Baron wants to talk to us.
12) 41) text: Ben and Robby enter. Marty’s on the phone.
12) 44) dialog: Jon Albano?
12) 46) dialog: Who’s the Judge on this case?
12) 48) dialog: Tough.
12) 50) dialog: Good Catholic girl. Marty pushes on. 11/26/14 16.
12) 52) dialog: No it’s not. We looked hard at Geoghan. David Armstrong for Metro and Michael Paulson for Religion. Marty isn’t impressed.
12) 54) dialog: No, we haven’t.
12) 59) dialog: Marty, in the past, Spotlight has had success in large part because they pick their own projects.
22) 0) text: Mike and Matt sit with Ben and Steve Kurkjian at the game called third strike and the crowd groans.
22) 1) dialog: Jesus. Has anybody but Manny gotten the ball out of the infield? Matt, who’s been scoring the game, checks.
22) 8) dialog: You guys making any progress?
22) 10) dialog: Why? Cause you’re another lapsed Catholic pissed off at the Church?
22) 12) dialog: Like what? 11/26/14 30. Mike glances over at Kurkjian.
22) 17) dialog: Sounds thin. What else you got?
22) 22) dialog: We ran a couple stories on him, the guy would not stop writing letters.
22) 25) dialog: Where are you on Garabedian?
22) 27) dialog: Robby said MacLeish thinks he’s bluffing.
22) 29) dialog: Get me something solid or I'm taking you off it. I don’t want us chasing our tails on this.
33) 11) dialog: I’m late for a dinner. Walk me out.
34) 0) text: Ben and Robby walk. Robby sees Marty in his office, worki
34) 2) dialog: Apparently not. I got guys who won't leave ‘til he does, he’s wearing out the goddamn newsroom. Robby smiles.
34) 3) dialog: Where are we on Geoghan?
34) 5) dialog: Why? 65 11/26/14 55.
34) 7) dialog: Thirteen? Who’s your source?
34) 9) dialog: Christ, Robby, I told Mike --
34) 11) dialog: You wanna elaborate on that?
34) 13) dialog: Okay.
42) 0) text: Ben sits with the gang.
42) 1) dialog: So this was all under the table?
42) 4) dialog: It’s more complicated than that. MacLeish has got a duty to his clients to get the best deal he can. 75 11/26/14 64.
42) 8) dialog: Yeah. (then) Did MacLeish confirm all of Saviano’s priests?
42) 11) dialog: So it’s thirteen priests?
42) 13) dialog: Holy Shit. Okay. Keep going. off Ben --
47) 21) dialog: Ninety fucking priests? In Boston?
47) 23) dialog: If there were ninety of these bastards people would know.
47) 25) dialog: And no one said a thing?
47) 27) dialog: I don’t think that’s a comparison you want to make publicly.
47) 29) dialog: That’s thirteen priests, big difference between thirteen and ninety. Where’s this guy Sipe getting his numbers?
47) 31) dialog: Okay, but we need something more than a metric from some hippy ex- priest who’s shacking up with a nun.
47) 33) dialog: That’s a shitload of victims. 81 11/26/14 74.
47) 35) dialog: How long’s it gonna take? Mike shrugs. Robby considers. Then...
47) 37) dialog: Meeting over?
58) 29) dialog: The Archbishop of Canterbury. Mike opens the door. Ben’s there with a PIZZA BOX.
58) 30) dialog: I had dinner at Santarpio’s, had some leftovers. He hands Mike the pizza.
58) 32) dialog: Yeah. Ben enters, takes in Mike’s apartment. Mike grabs two bee Jesus. How much longer you gonna be in this shithole?
58) 34) dialog: She's a good girl, Mike.
58) 36) dialog: Have you met this guy in person yet?
58) 39) dialog: So, where are we on the ninety?
58) 43) dialog: How close?
58) 45) dialog: Just answer the question, will you? Mike clocks this.
58) 47) dialog: Just surprising, that’s all.
58) 50) dialog: (irked) No. Why?
58) 52) dialog: (pissed off) Saviano was a fucking train wreck five years ago, Mike. We didn’t miss anything. This story needed Spotlight. Mike’s taken aback.
58) 54) dialog: Good night. Ben walks off. Mike watches him go. INT. GLOBE, MARTY’S OFFICE - DAY 94 CLOSE ON an EMAILED LIST of Priests and victims.
58) 55) dialog: This is unbelievable.
58) 59) dialog: We're still working Garabedian. But nothing concrete. Marty considers this. Then he turns to Robby.
58) 61) dialog: That's just Law being Law.
58) 73) dialog: Sounds like we’re going after Law?
73) 2) dialog: Not bad. Who’s there? 11/26/14 99.
73) 4) dialog: I wanna talk to him when he’s back. (to Robby) Did Rezendes find a way to get to Florida?
73) 7) dialog: I‘ll give you three of my guys. Robby, put your team on that too.
73) 9) dialog: And Robby, everything else stops.
75) 10) dialog: Marty, you gotta a second?
75) 12) dialog: Robby’s itching to get his team back on the church story. At this point, I think we're covered on 9/11.
75) 15) dialog: Oh. Well... thanks. (awkward, exiting) Good night.
94) 22) text: Marty, Ben, Robby, and Canellos (the Metro editor we met earlier) sit with the Globe lawyer, Albano. 11/26/14 120.

94) 37) dialog: A couple of weeks?
94) 39) dialog: And you're telling us now?
94) 42) dialog: For what? This is the goddamn story.
94) 44) dialog: (dismissive) Tough shit. We’re on a clock now. Even if we don’t run Sweeney's ruling, another paper could find these letters and fuck the story.
94) 52) dialog: Too risky. If we’re not buttoned up on every single one of them, the Church’11 pick us apart. Robby’s up against it. He plays his hand.
94) 54) dialog: Someone inside the Church?
94) 58) dialog: Rezendes needs time to write up the story. We don’t want to drop this at Christmas, not after 9/11. We could run it just after New Year's, before the rest of the documents are released.
94) 63) text: Ben and Robby walk out.
94) 64) dialog: Tell Mike I want a draft before Christmas. And we need a response from Lake Street. Who does PR for the Cardinal? Still John Walsh?
94) 66) dialog: Good, get a quote, we need something from Law to appear even-handed.
94) 68) dialog: And Robby? Next time give me a goddamn heads up? Ben exits. Robby takes it on the chin then walks off. As does, we hear a child’s voice start into SILENT NIGHT...
94) 69) text: As a second child joins in, we see a SERIES OF SHOTS... MIKE’S COMPUTER. 41 days until deadline. The very 157A start of the story. FIND Mike in SPOTLIGHT, pecking out the story on his COMPUTER. Matt, coat and briefcase, walks out... Sacha with Phil, Crowley and another guy at a shitty 1571 DINER, sad Christmas decor. Sacha doesn’t eat, she writes on a pad. MIKE’S COMPUTER. 21 days until deadline. The story 157Fa is further along... Matt drives down the street in HIS CAR, eyes on an old 15 man, putting down salt on the front walk of the TREATMENT CENTER. In BEN’S OFFICE, Mike watches Ben and Robby read the 157E story. Cross outs. He hands it back to Mike. Not there yet.
98) 12) dialog: What?
98) 16) dialog: Jesus Christ.
98) 22) dialog: (to Marty) That oughta do it.
98) 29) dialog: I’m more concerned about the phones at reception. (MORE )
98) 31) dialog: After we ran the Porter story, the message center was tied up for weeks. It was a real problem.
98) 39) dialog: But he has no problem helping the church protect dozens of dirty priests. Guy’s a scumbag. Matt glances at Robby. Who’s looking at Ben.
98) 42) dialog: He knew and did nothing.
98) 45) dialog: What’s that supposed to mean?
98) 47) dialog: We didn’t have all the pieces.
98) 49) dialog: You know what? We got it now.
98) 52) dialog: So what? We didn’t know the scope of this. No one did. This started with one goddamn priest, Robby. Robby looks at Sacha. A beat.
98) 55) dialog: When?
98) 59) dialog: That was you. You were Metro.
99) 1) text: The building is dark, save for the PRESS ROOM. Through th window, we see the presses. Running. INT. GLOBE, BEN’S OFFICE - NIGHT (FORMERLY 166A) 166
99) 2) text: Ben, coat on, sits alone in his office. MARTY (0.C. Leaving?
99) 5) dialog: Yeah. Ben walks out into --
100) 1) text: Ben and Marty walk across the quiet press room.
100) 3) dialog: Really. Why?
100) 5) dialog: Jesus, the balls on that guy. What’d you say?
100) 7) dialog: Damn right we’re gonna run it.
