43) 9) dialog: He’s an extraordinary man. I’m glad you had a chance to chat.
82) 20) dialog: (to Robby, direct) Robby, as well-intentioned as Bill’s remarks are, I’m hoping maybe we can keep this between us until we all get on the same page.
82) 22) dialog: No, we’re here because you’re an important alumnus, Robby, and a friend.
94) 2) dialog: Looks like a long day.
94) 4) dialog: I’m sorry to make it longer. Brian? Peter Conley sits, nods to the barman: ‘the usual.’
94) 6) dialog: Sure. The trick is to keep asking. (raising his glass) For Boston. 11/26/14 118.
94) 8) dialog: No, no, I wouldn’t presume to speak for the Cardinal. (then) You gotta a lot of people here who respect you, Robby, respect your work.
94) 10) dialog: It’s ‘cause you care about this place. It’s why you do what you do, it’s who you are. But people need the Church more than ever right now. You can feel it. And the Cardinal May not be perfect but we can’t throw out all the good he’s doing over a few bad apples. Robby lets this sink in. Nods as if in agreement. PETER CONLEY (CONT’D) I’m bringing this up with you because I know this is Baron’s idea. His agenda. And I gotta tell you, honest to God, I don’t think he cares about this city the way we do. How could he? Robby looks at Conley. A long beat.
94) 12) dialog: What’s that?
94) 14) dialog: Robby, look. Marty Baron is just trying to make his mark. He’1ll be here for a couple years and he’s gonna move on. Just like he did in New York and Miami. Where you gonna go? He starts to go.
94) 16) dialog: We'll talk again later. Good night, Robby. INT. GLOBE, ROBBY’S OFFICE/SPOTLIGHT OFFICE - DAY 153
