In fact, the sterile requirements of milk processing are surprisingly close to those of a laboratory.

She looks like statue, the only thing betraying life are the exquisitely alien tones that tumble from her puckered lips. Clive can't bring himself to take his eyes off her until, unexpectedly and with shocking speed, she stares right ba at him. Instinctively, he presses himself flat against the wall. Like he's been caught doing something terribly wrong. He hustles over to his car and tears down the dusty drive.

97) 3) dialog: Let's lighten things up around here. Clive moves to another part of the room, slides a CD into boom-box on the counter. It's the rendition of "Under My Skin" that Dren likes. The music perks her up. She sways in time with it, chortl and whistling. Clive does a comical two-step that brings a hint of a smi to Dren's face. Emulating him, she sways from foot to foo in time with the music.

Clive comes up to her, positions Dren's arms on his shoul putting one hand above her hip, the other gently on her b He leads her in a clumsy rocking slow dance, slightly ridiculous at first -- like the ill-matched couples in an elementary school gymnasium.
97) 5) dialog: Follow my lead. They slowly find a measure of synch, despite their differ anatomy. Clive's lead sets an elegant rhythm.
97) 6) dialog: I'll show you how the pros do it. Clive throws a couple of variations into the foot work. Dren, now in the groove, follows perfectly. They become graceful and lightfooted.
97) 7) dialog: My first girlfriend made me take dance lessons. (beat) Don't tell Elsa. 100 88. As though triggered by the hint of conspiracy, Dren tight her grip on Clive, drawing him in close. The move is subt adjusting her balance, but they now dance body-to-body. Dren's eyes close, her head rolls back, getting lost in t music and the intimacy. Despite himself, Clive is becomin aroused. He notes the sensuous length of her neck, the ar of her back, her hair... He freezes. Drops his arms. Dren's eyes open, bewildered. Wondering what she's done wrong. Clive gently brushes back Dren's hair where he finds a SI SHOCK OF WHITE.

He pours himself a healthy hit o liquor, tosses it down his throat. His laptop is open. On-screen is a webcam feed from the barn: several cameras trained on various angles encompass the room. No sign of Dren. All at once, her face pops up. Clive catches this. Comes close. Then as if sensing his presence, she abruptly disappears. He flips through several windows, picking her up again fr another angle: She climbs the step ladder, removes her hospital gown and slides into her water tank. He calls up an underwater camera. Dren sensuously rolls h naked body against the wall of the pool, the water acting like a healing salve for her damaged tail. He can't get o how lithe and womanly she has become. Instinctively, he reaches out and runs his fingers along image. As he does this, Dren's own hand reaches out, and impossibly, brushes past the camera, mirroring his gestur Clive jumps back, jolted from his trance. He slams the la shut.

110) 2) dialog: Dren, you can't... what are you doing? Dren stares at him hungrily. Her parted lips have a fulln he'd never noticed. Her eyes shine with unabashed, pure lust. The knowledge that some part of her is Elsa somehow heightens the moment. When her mouth finds its way back to his, he plunges in w abandon. Her hospital gown falls off one shoulder. Dren wraps her legs around Clive's torso, driving her breasts to his face, her wings unfurl, flapping excitedly. Clive presses her up against the water tank. They writhe the floor, gown riding up over her waist. Clive quickly fumbles open his pants, tears open his shirt. His mouth is all over her marble-white torso. Dren's tail rides up between his legs, exploring. She arches her back allowing entry. Clive's body surrenders to the moment. In the growing excitement, the bandage on Dren's tail beg to tear off. The stump has already healed over -- And the severed stinger has grown back, protruding from the new s of skin and dripping with fresh venom! It curls around Clive, a hair's breadth from his naked sk But Clive is oblivious, building to climax. A STARTLED GASP pulls him out of it. Clive and Dren freeze as one.

The resemblance hammers Clive's brain. Elsa finally unfreezes. She backs toward the door, gets a hand on the doorknob and tears out of there.
