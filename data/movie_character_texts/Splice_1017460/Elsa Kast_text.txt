It's the kind with a lazy- Susan base, and raised ridges to line up the letters. Elsa spills the bag of letters onto the floor and quickly rummages for the tiles she wants. She arranges the letter P-E-N onto the board then pivots it so the word appears upright to the Hybrid. She holds up a PEN, then points to the letters.
57) 5) dialog: P-E-N! That says PEN. PEN! She puts down the pen and points to the word.
57) 6) dialog: What's that? Show me. Show me the pen. The Hybrid just stares at her blankly. Elsa arranges the letters of her own name, E-L-S-A.
57) 7) dialog: That's ELSA. Me. (tapping her chest) I'm Elsa. Elsa. The Hybrid's face is a blank slate of incomprehension. El points back to the first word, and holds up the ballpoint
57) 8) dialog: PEN! This is a PEN. (tapping her chest) ELSA. I'm Elsa. Pen... Elsa. 48. Elsa searches the Hybrid's face, desperate to detect the slightest sign of association. Nothing. Elsa notices the Hybrid's gaze is fixated on the box of N in her breast pocket. She spills a couple into her palm - incentive. The Hybrid's eyes dart, her mouth opens slight Holding the Nerds hostage in her palm, Elsa points again the word: PEN.
57) 9) dialog: What's that? PEN. (beat) Where's the pen? Still nothing. Not a glimmer. Elsa pops the Nerds into he own mouth with a sigh, then tips the board, spilling the letters to the floor. She sees palpable disappointment in the Hybrid's eyes -- reacting to the lost reward. Elsa gets another idea. She rifles through the tiles, plucking up five letters to spell the word: N-E-R-D-S. She rotates the board, then holds up the box of candy whe the same letters are clearly marked on the label: NERDS. The Hybrid's eyes flit quickly from the Nerds to the Scra board, then back to the Nerds. Elsa smiles. Something's starting to click.
57) 10) dialog: Nerds... C'mon. You know what Nerds are. The Hybrid reaches out a spindly hand to touch the tiles, her eyes skipping to the actual package of candy.
57) 11) dialog: That's right. They're the same.
57) 13) dialog: You did it! You made a connection! Good girl! Elsa spills some real Nerds onto the game board and the H quickly gobbles them up. The door opens behind Elsa. She spins quickly to greet Clive. The Hybrid cowers at his arrival. 49.

57) 16) dialog: She can associate!
57) 18) dialog: What's the problem?

57) 24) dialog: I'm compiling a developmental profile. She needs more stimulation than that room.
57) 26) dialog: Alright, so we'll move her. We'll put her in the storage room downstairs. Nobody goes down there.
57) 28) dialog: When the hell did you get so fucking scared of everything! Something triggers in Clive. He takes three furious steps into Elsa's face. Yelling now. Loudly.
57) 32) dialog: 
57) 34) dialog: (cool, in command) Go to your place. Dren eyes Clive once more before obediently skulking back into her corner. Clive sits up, breathing heavily, still little afraid.
57) 35) dialog: It's okay. She won't hurt you. She helps Clive up.
57) 36) dialog: I know we have a situation. But we just have to deal with it.

58) 1) dialog: Stay inside, Dren. Clive nervously glances around the corner. Coast is clear
58) 3) dialog: Scared. It's all right. They truck the cart around the corner and manage to get t the freight elevator undetected. Elsa hits the down butto The elevator rises up from the basement at a snail's pace Finally the doors open, revealing... Dexter, who looks startled to see them.
58) 5) dialog: Hey, Dex. Dexter's eyes land on the EEG machine on top of the cart with a variety of other devices.

60) 4) dialog: Once they see Ginger and Fred, don't you think the world's going to want to know what's next? She holds Dren's face next to her own, as though this wer all she needed to make her case to the world.
60) 5) dialog: Do you think they can look at this face... And see anything less than a miracle? Clive's jaw hangs open, stunned at Elsa's naivete. And as if on cue, Dren pukes on Elsa's shoulder, then bur her head miserably in Elsa's chest.
60) 6) dialog: Oh... oh no. Oh Sweetie, you're sick. Clive shakes his head, astounded. The whole thing is gett to be too much. Elsa puts her wrist to Dren's forehead.
60) 7) dialog: Clive, she's really hot.
62) 0) text: It's night now, Clive has accomplished a lot with the roo piling all the unwanted boxes to one side. He finishes mopping the floor while Elsa dotes over sick Dren. She pu a thermometer from Dren's mouth and studies it.

62) 3) dialog: (frantic) I know. We have to do something!

62) 10) dialog: How? Fuck! HOW?! Clive turns to the industrial sink and runs the faucet.
62) 12) dialog: Cold bath!
62) 15) dialog: Hurry. With her legs folded under her, Clive and Elsa manage to squeeze Dren into the sink sideways. 58. She squirms slightly at the shock of cold water, but hasn the strength to resist.
62) 16) dialog: It's okay, honey. It's okay. Dren's breathing is getting even more shallow. Elsa tries to hold her head up to facilitate the flow of oxygen. It' no good.
62) 17) dialog: She can't breath. Her passages are closing! Do something!
62) 19) dialog: 
62) 22) dialog: With what?
62) 24) dialog: There's no time. Clive gives Elsa a lost, defeated look... like this was inevitable. He shakes his head. Frustration rising. Suddenly, he grabs Dren by the head and pushes her face u water. Elsa SCREAMS.
62) 25) dialog: Clive! Stop it! She pulls at his arms. Smashes at his shoulder. Dren, wit the little strength she has left, squirms for her life.
62) 27) dialog: You're killing her! Let her go! (shrieking)
62) 29) dialog: She's breathing! DREN has by-passed her clogged mouth and nose and is brea through gills which have emerged under her jaw-line. Cliv relaxes his arms. Dren has ceased struggling. He simply holds her gently under the surface.
62) 32) dialog: You saved her. My God! (ecstatic) How did you know? Clive responds with an awkward shrug.
62) 33) dialog: You did know, right? There's a moment. Just the slightest instant of hesitatio
63) 1) dialog: In the first three months since her birth, Dren, the world's first human- animal chimera, has far outstripped our expectations. Clive enters the FRAME with a cake. At first, Dren shrink from the three flickering birthday candles. But with Cliv instruction, she quickly learns to blow them out. She fla a gap-toothed smile.
63) 2) dialog: While genetically she follows the same template as our H-40 hybrids, the added human element appears to be taking a dominant role. Dren now looks to be perhaps ELEVEN, and increasingly gir like. Hair is beginning to thicken. The seam-like scar down her face and body is less prominent. Elsa conducts Dren, who sways and whistles in odd tones a to a Big Band rendition of "Under My Skin" while THE VIDE CAMERA MOVES AROUND HER BODY. Clive lifts her arms for a closer view. There is a strange muscle system running und them and joining to the skin of her back.
63) 5) dialog: Intelligence and communication skills continue to improve. Still, her mind remains her greatest mystery. Dren sinks below the surface disappearing from the CAMERA VIEW.

64) 2) dialog: Oh! I'm sorry, Dren. I forgot. She leans over and gives Dren a kiss on each cheek and on on the forehead. The Hybrid's tension instantly vaporizes In another instant, she's asleep, her face at peace. Elsa draws a curtain suspended from the ceiling and turns Clive with a whisper.
64) 3) dialog: She's had a big day. Together they collapse onto the cushions of an old couch. Elsa looks exhausted. With her skirt well up above her kn Clive finds himself admiring her legs.
64) 5) dialog: Oh, God. I didn't even notice. (beat) Is that what happens?
64) 7) dialog: When they work too hard? That wasn't quite what Clive meant, but he nods anyway.
64) 9) dialog: What, here?
64) 12) dialog: What's the worst that could happen? Clive is about to put a stop to their passion when someth catches his eye. A shimmer. He pushes Elsa's hair out of his face. He sees her. Dren. Peering through the curtains. Her excited breathing gives her away. Oblivious, Elsa continu to ride him, her arousal building. The moment is surreal. Clive continues to watch Dren watching. He says nothing. Sexual momentum builds. Strangeness.

PERFECTLY ON CUE, the cages align. The walls separating them sink away. Ginger and Fred are free to mingle in a single double-sized cage. As each steps forward, a little disoriented by the bright lights, there is a COMMUNAL GASP from the audience.
66) 5) dialog: They are state of the art designer organisms! Ginger and Fred approach each other, sniffing and aroused like they have a hundred times before. Their mutual excitement is so focused, they become oblivious to their surroundings.
66) 6) dialog: Man's newest and best friend... The audience, getting their first clear view of the Hybri in motion, are awed and silent. A video projector splashe live close-ups on the wall behind them.
66) 7) dialog: ...-Here to point the way to a better... The Hybrids' approach includes the usual PURRING RUMBLE. Then, an agitated raising of hackles. Ginger's mouth open a string of drool dropping to the floor.

THEY TEAR AT EACH OTHER WITH TEETH AND CLAWS LIKE RABID DOGS. Blood and bits of flesh splatter the gla Dexter and several lab techs rush to help but are powerle to stop the carnage. The savage fight continues until the hybrids are hidden from view behind bloody glass. A breathless moment of quiet. THE SOUNDS RESUME full force as the cages buckle and then shatter. The frenzied and mangled forms of Ginger and Fre tumble out. They roll across the stage, then fall off int the audience! SCREAMS and PANDEMONIUM. Melinda and The Photographer lea to their feet, just in time to catch a splash of blood ac their faces and the camera lens. Within moments, Ginger, then Fred, collapse into puddles blood and torn flesh. Clive, Elsa, Dexter and Barlow, all stand speechless befo the mound of gore that was their scientific triumph.

71) 3) dialog: My mother had... problems. After my father died, I became her everything.
71) 5) dialog: One time I made her a birthday card. I forgot to write, "I love you." For that, she locked me in my room for a week. Without food or water. Clive glances over, horrified, seeing Elsa in a new light Her quirks suddenly taking on new significance.
71) 7) dialog: I just wanted to forget about it. Dren presses herself against the side of Elsa's car seat. Elsa rubs Dren's hand where it grips the upholstery.

Dren's eyes widen with surprise at the moist cushy sensat of grass and earth. Clive and Elsa each take a firm grip on Dren's arms and w her towards the barn. Dren's behavior begins to change. Her eyes squint to pluc a million sights from the moonlit night: trees, grass, st She arches her back so that her nostrils can sort through dazzling array of smells. Her ears tune into exotic sound Curiosity and excitement rapidly eclipse her fear. Suddenly, Dren wrenches herself from Clive and Elsa's clutches. Spinning out of their grip, she takes off into the night.

73) 5) dialog: Dren! Dren, honey? Dren spins her whole body around. She hasn't been crying she's been eating. The carcass of a dead raccoon is torn open in her hands.

74) 2) dialog: That was bad. You understand? Bad Dren! Dren reacts to Elsa's harsh tone. Her brow furrows, lip curls into a hurt expression. Elsa notices Clive watching her, a little surprised at her severity. Elsa draws Dren close to her, holds her tight.

74) 6) dialog: Honey, please. Dren tears away from Elsa.

85) 11) dialog: Oh, Dren. (sadly apologetic) No, I know. But you can't go outside. I'm sorry. You just can't. In a sudden fit of anger, Dren shoves herself backwards, knocking over the table, food, letters, everything.

The wings instinctively flap, lifting her body just enoug to regain her balance. She releases a triumphant SHRIEK a lets the wings relax and settle at her sides. Shreds of dry, leathery skin flake away in the breeze. With the emergence of the wings, the lumpen, misshapen ma of her back has transformed itself. Her body is now lean, streamlined, elegant and complete. Clive and Elsa observe her speechlessly. Their ugly duckl has become a swan.
