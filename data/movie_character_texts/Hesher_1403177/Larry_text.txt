1) 23) dialog: (to tow truck driver) Hey, Bill.
1) 28) dialog: I beg your pardon?
1) 33) dialog: And where was it supposed to go?
1) 37) dialog: 
1) 45) dialog: Well, it's his name on the pink slip, son. And that means it's his to sell if he wants.
1) 58) dialog: Thanks, Bill.
1) 62) dialog: Get out of the car, son.
1) 65) dialog: Dustin, get him outta there, will ya?
1) 89) dialog: I'd get out of here kid, before he works himself loose.
45) 3) dialog: Yes?
45) 7) dialog: Oh, yeah? What about?
45) 12) dialog: Yeah, I figured that. You made it pretty clear the last time you were here, and I thought I made it pretty clear that I couldn't give it to you.
45) 16) dialog: The car's not for sale.
45) 21) dialog: I don't know. We're talking at least eighteen hundred dollars, not including taxes, registration, ADM, or dealer's fees. On top of that, you'd need a driver's license. I'm guessing you don't have one of those. You'd need valid car insurance. I'm guessing you don't have that either. But even if you did have these things, I still couldn't sell it to you because the car's not street legal. There's a million reasons why I can't sell it to you.
45) 30) dialog: Look kid, I appreciate your enthusiasm, I really do, but I don't know what to tell you. You can't have the car. End of story.
45) 33) dialog: Do you mind if I get back to it here?
94) 3) dialog: Yeah, why don't you just have him send them over... Sure... Scott, can you hold on a minute?
94) 8) dialog: I'm on the phone here. Can you see that?
94) 12) dialog: I'm on the phone. Wait outside. I'll be with you in a minute.
94) 37) dialog: What?
94) 41) dialog: What money?
94) 45) dialog: What money for the car?
94) 49) dialog: Are you kidding me?
94) 55) dialog: Kid. Leave me alone. I feel like I've had this conversation with you too many times already, but I can tell you we won't be having it again because the car's gone.
94) 59) dialog: It's all over. It's gone. It's not here.
94) 69) dialog: Kid. It's over. Good bye.
