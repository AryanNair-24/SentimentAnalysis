23) 25) dialog: Leave him alone!
23) 39) dialog: What are you doing?!
23) 47) dialog: Are you alright?
23) 52) dialog: I don't think so. Am I?
24) 3) dialog: I can't believe he called me lady. Do I look like a lady to you?
24) 7) dialog: Thanks. I mean do I look old? Well anyway, at least I can say I've been in a fight.
24) 16) dialog: I can't believe he called me lady.
24) 21) dialog: Oh shit.
24) 24) dialog: Ah, fuck it.
24) 27) dialog: Hey, so I'm kinda like a hero now, aren't I?
24) 32) dialog: Well actually, I basically just didn't want to have to go home and then spend the rest of the day feeling bad about the fact that I didn't help you and then hear about you on the news being beat to death in the parking lot. So you know, really I'm just - I did it for me. I'm just selfish.
24) 36) dialog: Oh, gas station.
24) 46) dialog: Whoaaa... sorry, sorry.
25) 3) dialog: Perfect landing.
25) 6) dialog: You like black or red?
25) 10) dialog: Black? Really? Are you sure?
25) 14) dialog: 
25) 20) dialog: Red it is.
26) 3) dialog: It's super sour isn't it? You don't have to eat it if you don't like it.
26) 14) dialog: I know, that's the point. I used to hate this crazy sour stuff, I don't know what happened. I just recently acquired a taste for it. I don't even really know what's in it, but I pretty much eat it all the time. And I'm sure it's making me fat. I just don't want to end up like those fat old ladies you sometimes see, you know, the really fat ones?
26) 17) dialog: I don't know why I'm telling you this. Anyway, I was secretly hoping that you loved these -
26) 20) dialog: So you could eat 'em for me. But now I can see you don't like em' and I'm kinda glad cuz it means more for me. I guess I'm sort of a hypocrite in a way.
27) 6) dialog: Hey!
27) 9) dialog: You want your bike?
48) 3) dialog: Hi Sir, how are you today? Oh, hey.
48) 7) dialog: How's it goin'?
48) 12) dialog: Oh my god. That's so sweet, thanks.
48) 24) dialog: Oh, OK.
48) 27) dialog: Thanks.
48) 33) dialog: See ya.
48) 36) dialog: (to next customer) Hi.
78) 3) dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't -
83) 3) dialog: Sometimes, you know, a day is bad and then when you think it couldn't get any worse you suddenly discover whole new ways it can get worse.
83) 6) dialog: No, thanks.
83) 20) dialog: Was that some kind of perverted metaphor for me? About how I should just step back and let things work themselves out?
83) 34) dialog: What the hell was that?
83) 39) dialog: What?
83) 42) dialog: 
84) 3) dialog: Who's that guy?
84) 8) dialog: We're where?
84) 21) dialog: What was that back there?
84) 25) dialog: That other house?
85) 6) dialog: What the fuck!?
85) 10) dialog: Yeah, and now I'm wet.
85) 26) dialog: Cut it out.
85) 43) dialog: So, how do you know this guy?
85) 53) dialog: What, like he's renting a room or something?
85) 58) dialog: Do you realize that the equivalent to you flicking that ant would be like one of us getting hit in the face by a giant wrecking ball at 100 miles an hour and getting thrown into the next yard?
85) 63) dialog: Do you think the other ants are gonna wonder where that ant's gone? Do you think their gonna miss her?
85) 68) dialog: Jesus Christ.
85) 97) dialog: Did he just leave us? I think we should get out of here.
86) 6) dialog: So, what's his name?
86) 17) dialog: Hesher?... Is that a name?
86) 21) dialog: Does he have a last name?
86) 25) dialog: How old is he?
86) 29) dialog: Do you know anything about him?
86) 34) dialog: That was so lucky you guys were behind me when that guy got all mad about his car. I was freaking out. I don't really have any insurance right now. I just can't afford it. There's no way I could afford to fix that guy's car. How do people do this stuff? I mean, I have a job. It's kind of a joke though. I've been there for like a year and I'm still only doing like five hours a week. Why aren't they giving me any more hours? Do you think it's because they think I suck? Did you think I sucked when I served you at the checkout?
86) 39) dialog: I don't even get paid enough to really cover my rent. I'm gonna have to start selling shit pretty soon.
86) 51) dialog: The sad thing is I could actually use it.
87) 3) dialog: Oh, no. Please tell me that's not a ticket...
87) 6) dialog: Fuck, fuck, fuck it.
87) 9) dialog: Ah, shit. Fuck it.
87) 13) dialog: What have I done to deserve this chain reaction of shit all the time? Sometimes I wonder if I were to die right now, if anyone would care, or even notice.
87) 25) dialog: That's nice of you to say, but I doubt it.
87) 34) dialog: Please don't call me lady.
87) 37) dialog: Let's get out of here.
87) 40) dialog: You wanna steer or push?
129) 5) dialog: I came to see you.
129) 15) dialog: I wanted to tell you something.
129) 18) dialog: I didn't know if I should come here or not, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. I thought maybe if I came you'd still just be really angry at me and hate me, but then I thought if I didn't you'd think I didn't care and you'd hate me anyway, so I figured I might as well come, just in case, so here I am.
129) 22) dialog: I want to apologize. I feel bad about what happened. I didn't take your feelings into consideration -
129) 26) dialog: Yes it does. It does to me. I like you, TJ. We're friends.
129) 29) dialog: I understand if you don't want to be my friend. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Sometimes I just... I don't know. I just wanted to come around and say all that, but maybe you still hate me and so it doesn't matter, but I just came round to say that, but I've said it now, so I should just go. So, OK, bye.
129) 41) dialog: It's OK.
129) 45) dialog: It's OK.
129) 50) dialog: But I'm a prostitute?
