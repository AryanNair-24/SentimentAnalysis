83) 17) dialog: This one time I had like four hella drunk chicks in the back of the van, and we were going for it and I had one hand on this one girl's tit and my other hand on this other chick's twat, but there was like still two other girls wanting to get off so like I had my foot rubbing on one girl's asshole while I'm trying to eat the other girl out, and I was going crazy man. It was too much. I couldn't work out which chick was which and I'm making one girl cum but then I'm forgetting about the others and my tongue's hurting and my fingers are getting tired and like eventually I was just like 'Fuck this. This is too much' and I just stepped back. I just stepped back. And before you know it these girls are all working on each other, you know. They're all fingering each other and eating each other out, you know, and I jerk myself off and everyone's a winner, you know?
83) 22) dialog: A what?
83) 37) dialog: I saw a mouse.
84) 6) dialog: We're here. Come on, let's go.
84) 10) dialog: My uncle's house.
84) 23) dialog: What was what?
84) 27) dialog: Wrong house.
85) 8) dialog: What? You're dirty.
85) 13) dialog: You're dirty and wet. I'm coming in...
85) 16) dialog: Now I'm dirty and wet too.
85) 28) dialog: R2! Shut down all the fucken' trash compactors on the detention level!
85) 31) dialog: ...All the fucking trash compactors... (underwater, then up again) ...on the detention level!...

85) 84) dialog: Shit, look at that.
85) 87) dialog: I got a doctor's appointment.
89) 16) dialog: So did you fuck her?
89) 63) dialog: (discreetly, to TJ) Did you finger her twat?
89) 125) dialog: 
89) 139) dialog: This is delicious.
89) 150) dialog: What's green and slimy and smells like bacon?
89) 154) dialog: What's green and slimy and smells like bacon?
89) 158) dialog: Oh, OK.
90) 3) dialog: Did you figure it out yet?
90) 7) dialog: What's green and slimy and smells like bacon?
90) 11) dialog: Sure, what?
90) 24) dialog: Kermit the frog's finger.
90) 28) dialog: Think about it... Miss Piggy.
90) 31) dialog: Woah, what's that?
90) 35) dialog: 
90) 39) dialog: No shit.
90) 42) dialog: I'll be right back.
90) 46) dialog: May I?
90) 58) dialog: It's a bong. The water filters the smoke. It's probably the most healthy way to smoke weed.
90) 61) dialog: OK, so basically cover the hole here with your thumb then suck on the top and once the chamber fills with smoke, take your finger off the hole and suck in.
90) 64) dialog: Then try and hold the smoke in for as long as possible, OK bro?
90) 69) dialog: Ok, lift your finger.
90) 74) dialog: Yeah, that was good. Hit it again.
90) 92) dialog: Who wants to know?
90) 96) dialog: Who?
90) 100) dialog: Aren't you?
90) 104) dialog: Yeah, I guess you have a point... OK, well I used to have a mouse. No, wait... hang on a minute. I used to have a snake. And do you know what snakes eat?
90) 109) dialog: Yeah, OK, OK well, actually they eat mice.
90) 120) dialog: Yeah, OK, well anyway... I used to have a snake and I fed it mice. But one time I fed this little fuckin' mouse to my snake and that mouse was tough. I dropped that mouse in the snake's tank and the snake wouldn't go near him, and any time he tried that mouse would just smack him with his little, you know...
90) 123) dialog: With his little mouse hand. So instead of eating the mouse the snake just curled up crying in the corner and the mouse ruled that fuckin' cage. And this went on for weeks, the snake wouldn't go near him. That tiny mouse used to sit in a little miniature lawn chair scratching his balls and shelling peanuts and this snake was just too scared to go near it. And cuz the snake was scared of that mouse I had to feed him other mice, but every time I dropped another mouse in the tank, it'd hide behind the brave mouse. And so eventually the snake starved to death. I had a cage full of mice.
90) 128) dialog: Maybe he is.
90) 132) dialog: You're an old lady.
90) 143) dialog: Yes you are. And you know what grandmother? I'm gonna go on a walk with you in the morning.
90) 147) dialog: I'm not going anywhere. I'm going with you. Around the block, I guess.
90) 151) dialog: No, I'm going with you.
98) 4) dialog: Grandma?
101) 6) dialog: 
101) 38) dialog: I gotta get the fuck out of here before I hurt someone.
109) 4) dialog: Hey, hey... wait.
109) 7) dialog: Hey! The fuck are you doing?
109) 20) dialog: Stop hitting my van.
109) 27) dialog: Dude, chill out for a second.
116) 3) dialog: I wanna talk to you.
116) 10) dialog: I fuckin' told you, leave my van out of this!
116) 19) dialog: Don't fuckin' touch m-
116) 30) dialog: Fuck you both! Motherfuckers!
120) 61) dialog: Hello.
120) 69) dialog: What?
120) 82) dialog: I just saved you.
120) 86) dialog: Only a bit, it's just a cut.
120) 92) dialog: What are you talking about?
120) 102) dialog: What's your problem?
133) 46) dialog: Actually, I'd like to add to TJ's speech. I think I know where he was going with that.
133) 55) dialog: Hey, hey, hey...
133) 58) dialog: What are you doing? Get your fuckin' hands off that box.
133) 64) dialog: Um...
133) 78) dialog: You touch me again, I'll rip your fucking head off and skull fuck you.
133) 81) dialog: Ah, OK. Listen. I know you guys don't want me here and I don't want to fucking be here, but I'm not here for me, I'm fuckin' here for her-
133) 84) dialog: - and I'm not fuckin' here to say goodbye or have my farewell or whatever the fuck you assholes call it - this is not how I want to say goodbye to someone I like - in this shit-hole with these-
133) 87) dialog: - fuckin' assholes.
133) 92) dialog: Yeah, well why don't you shut up for a second and listen cause I'm going to say what I want to say and then you'll never see me again. Alright?!
133) 103) dialog: I'm here cause she's been trying to tell you guys something, but you don't want to listen... so I'm gonna fuckin' break it down.
133) 106) dialog: I pulled the gas tank from an old Chevy and I wanted to fuckin' blow it up, so I did. I didn't think about the millions of bits of metal that were gonna fly in every direction. I almost killed myself. I woke up in a hospital. I couldn't remember what happened and then this doctor at the end of my bed said 'son', and I said, 'don't call me son you fuckin' cunt', then he said, 'you blew off your nut'. Some shrapnel had penetrated my left scrotal sack and ripped the furry sucker right off. My left fucking nut was gone, just like that.
133) 109) dialog: I went crazy. I assaulted a nurse, a doctor or two, I can't remember. I got arrested. I got sent to juvie. But all I could think about day and night was my missing fuckin' nut. I couldn't eat or sleep, I just wanted my fucking nut back. I had to get out of there and find it, so I busted out of juvie and went lookin' for it. I looked for days, but didn't find shit.
133) 112) dialog: And then one night I was taking a shit and I was just staring down at my balls, looking at my flabby piece of sack where my left nut used to be and then I noticed my right nut, for like the first time. My right nut was just sitting there, totally happy, just hanging out.
133) 119) dialog: All this time I'd been driving myself crazy thinking about my missing nut and not thinking about the nut I still had all along. And I realized, I've still got a nut. I've still got one good nut. God or the Devil or whoever left me with one good nut. At least I didn't lose both my nuts. I've still got one good nut and it works, and my dick works too.
133) 122) dialog: You lost your mom. You lost your wife. I lost a nut.
133) 125) dialog: Fuck this.
133) 129) dialog: Leave her alone. We're not finished yet.
133) 135) dialog: I told Grandma I was going on a walk with her and I'm gonna do it!
133) 147) dialog: You promised Grandma you'd go on a walk with her. This is your last chance.
135) 17) dialog: Get your hands off me, pig.
