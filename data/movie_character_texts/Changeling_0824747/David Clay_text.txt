182) 1) text: Christine is ushered into a room with a long two-way mirr that looks out into an interview room. Mr. and Mrs. Clay already there. In the other room is Detective Ybarra, and young boy, DAVID, age 13. Mrs. Clay sees her, and they embrace.
182) 16) dialog: They drove me around for a long time, then we ended up at this ranch --
183) 1) text: David is shoved into the chicken coop. Several other BOYS are already there, scared, crying. They lunge at the door trying to get out, but it slams shut in their faces.
183) 9) dialog: Yeah...six, I think. It was a long time ago.
184) 2) dialog: Yeah...two of them were brothers, I think their last name was Winslow, something like that. The oldest was Jeffrey, I think he was around eleven.... (beat) ...and Walter.
185) 7) dialog: Yeah.
185) 11) dialog: Collins.
185) 16) dialog: Because of what happened.
186) 3) dialog: Walter and Jeffrey were talking when everybody else was screaming. They were scared, same as the rest of us, but they weren't scared stupid. They kept checking around until they found a part of the coop where the chicken wire was all messed up.
186) 6) dialog: They figured we might be able to yank the chicken wire and bring down the corner, maybe make enough room to get out of there and run... but it would make an awful lot of noise and if it wasn't wide enough, we'd be stuck. It might even bring the whole place down.
186) 23) text: David holds up his hand.
186) 26) text: The Winslow boys and two others scramble to the other end too terrified to try and escape. Jeffrey, David and Walte go to the weakened corner of the coop.
186) 38) text: They race out the opening, Jeffrey first, then Walter, th David...but just as the first two get clear --
186) 40) dialog: Help!
186) 41) text: Walter turns to see David stuck in the wiring. LIGHTS go around the ranch. He hesitates...then RUNS back to David, helps to untangle him. They HEAR a SHOTGUN blast, and FEE running their way.
186) 43) dialog: Hurry!
186) 45) text: -- and David catches one last glimpse of Walter running, heading for the line of trees....
187) 1) text: As the interview continues.   David nods.
187) 3) dialog: That's the last I saw of any of 'em.
187) 7) dialog: No. All I know is, if he hadn't come back for me...I don't think I ever would've gotten out of there.
187) 11) dialog: I hid in the woods for two days, too scared to move, because I was sure they'd find me. I finally started walking, but every time a car came up I was afraid it was them. So I kept off the main roads until I saw a train stopped at a crossing, and I jumped in.
187) 17) dialog: I was afraid! I thought they'd come after me, or my folks...so I didn't tell anybody. I was on my own until I got a free meal from this lady, Mrs. Lansing. I told her I was an orphan, on my own. She said I could stay on, and...I did. (beat) Every night, I'd wake up, thinking they were right outside my window. Then I heard the police talking on the radio about what happened at the ranch, and I thought, for sure I can't go back now.
187) 21) dialog: Since I didn't tell anybody what happened, I was afraid they'd blame me for those kids being dead. So I just...stayed away.
187) 24) text: David looks away, his eyes tearing up.   Finally:
187) 26) dialog: I miss my mom...I miss my dad...I just...I just want to go home.
