17) 13) text: You did? SEBASTIAN
17) 15) text: That's a first. Most people praised me for it. SEBASTIAN
17) 17) text: I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions. SEBASTIAN
