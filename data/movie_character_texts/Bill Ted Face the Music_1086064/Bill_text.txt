Bill is engaged in a kind of wide- mouthed Aboriginal ‘throat-singing.’ While clearly a grea deal of of this and, in Wedding thought (and even love) has gone into the preparation piece, it is at its core quite difficult to define fact, impossible to enjoy. guests watch with jaw-dropped befuddlement as - 9.

10) 46) dialog: Whoa...
10) 51) dialog: Meaning..?
11) 2) dialog: Okay - bad news: the whole unraveling of time thing could be most heinous. Good news: This means there is a song. Otherwise they wouldn’t be so mad at us for not having it.

11) 6) dialog: Ted, what are you doing, dude? We gotta keep going.
11) 8) dialog: I don’t know.. But we gotta. (beat) I mean.. Right? What else are we gonna do, dude? Ted nods - distant and distracted.
11) 10) dialog: Well, yah.. at some point..

11) 13) dialog: Could we actually...?
11) 15) dialog: But-- didn’t Rufus say we could only do that in an extreme emergency?
12) 1) dialog: Okay, so here’s the plan: We go into the future to when we've actually written the song, find ourselves, and take it.
12) 3) dialog: Why would it be stealing if we’re getting it from ourselves?
12) 5) dialog: Only one way to find out, dude..
13) 2) dialog: Depends on when we think we’re gonna write the song.
13) 4) dialog: Well, let’s be conservative. Say five years?

16) 6) dialog: What are you talking about? You totally ran away from us!

16) 10) dialog: Look - dudes - we know exactly what you’re thinking: why are we playing here at open mic night at the Holiday Inn in San Dimas, when in fact, we are such huge rock stars with lots of groupies?
16) 12) dialog: Do you believe us?
16) 14) dialog: But this time you really can believe us. (pause) Do you believe us?
16) 16) dialog: Not at all. 50 Year Old Ted takes another (this time bigger) gulp fro his flask. As he wipes his mouth with his sleeve:
16) 18) dialog: Do you have the song?
16) 19) dialog: Do we have the song? Do we have the song?
16) 20) dialog: Yes. Do you?
16) 28) dialog: Whoa. Wait. What did you say? The princesses are gone?

16) 31) dialog: How??
16) 34) dialog: Oh - you did, alright - you just made it worse! They had their doubts about you, which you were totally missing, I might add.. and then you went back to Medieval England and confirmed every one of em!
16) 35) dialog: There is no way we did that.
16) 37) dialog: Not true. Ted - let’s go talk to our wives right now and set this straight.
16) 45) dialog: Ted - back away - he’s not worth it.
16) 46) dialog: He’s right. Don’t let that punk get to you. 50 Year Old Ted backs down. Bill turns Ted around.
16) 47) dialog: Let’s go clean up the mess those us’s made. As Older Bill and Ted open the van doors, Bill and Ted se BILL'S FATHER, in back, in a sleeping bag.
16) 49) dialog: You live with Dad in the van?

17) 3) dialog: I know. But we did learn something quite important from them. We gotta go back to England.
18) 6) dialog: Whatever we do, let’s not give those other us’s the satisfaction of making things worse.
18) 14) dialog: Yes you are - you just don’t realize it yet, you think you’re just here for a visit, but you’re totally gonna stay. Off the women’s confused looks:

18) 18) dialog: And lying. You can’t believe what oily liars we are.
18) 20) dialog: Which is ridiculous - cause knowing what we know we’re only making it better, right?
18) 23) dialog: Because if we don’t find it, it’s gonna be a lot worse than even that. 38.
18) 25) dialog: But don’t worry about that, cuz apparently the future is fluid.
18) 27) dialog: Like coming here and talking to you now.

21) 37) dialog: No way..
21) 40) dialog: Of course it worked. You guys totally took the song - the one we’re about to play for you - played it at the Forum - the girls were there - and it changed everything.
21) 41) dialog: Wait - we’re gonna play that concert?
21) 44) dialog: But what about the guys we just saw? Those loser us’s from 5 years ago?

21) 49) dialog: I must say, Ted, as much as I disliked those previous us’s, I like these us’s.
21) 52) dialog: The moment they’ve been waiting for for twenty years is h And - though we only hear the barest, most muffled SENSE music from beneath the headphones - from the very first moment we can tell that it’s not disappointing. A tear is forming in Bill’s eye. Ted looks stunned - deep impressed, but it’s more complex than that. And while this is happening, we CUT AWAY TO:
24) 0) text: Close on the guys as the song ends. Bill’s in tears. Ted’ in disbelief. They slowly pull the headphones off.
24) 1) dialog: That is truly the most amazing song I’ve ever heard.
24) 5) dialog: (re Ted’s watch) You guys should probably get going. Bill nods, shakes his older self’s hand.
24) 6) dialog: I‘’1l never forget you, Bill. 45.
24) 7) dialog: Right back atcha, Billy boy. The handshake turns into an affectionate bearhug. Ted loo at his older self.

25) 11) dialog: This is our house - or at least the house of future us’s.
25) 13) dialog: No, you need to leave right now, Eddie Van Halen - or we’ll call the cops. Suddenly - Ted slams the door and slides the deadbolt. He turns and starts purposefully down the hallway.
26) 0) text: 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted are undressing - as actors would a a performance. It’s now obvious why their clothes didn’t well: because they’re both wearing Eddie Van Halen’s clot and he’s bigger than Bill and smaller than Ted. Bill removes his WIG - revealing that he is almost totall bald (except a thin strip of Friar Tuck hair at the back)
26) 1) dialog: I think we totally fooled those other us's. Ted pulls his shirt off, revealing he is wearing a MALE GIRDLE. He loosens it - he’s easily 80 pounds overweight.
26) 5) dialog: What is it? 47. Ted nods to the cover which, when you look at it more carefully, is very obviously “photo-shopped.”

27) 12) dialog: You're totally bald, Bill.
27) 16) dialog: What were we thinking? That we had the perfect plan, and we still do.
27) 19) dialog: You gotta go right now.
27) 20) dialog: No way, it’s not our song.
27) 24) dialog: Dude! No! He’s ventriloquizing me! 55 Yr Old Bill shrugs - “innocent.” 49.
27) 26) dialog: Fine. I guess saving the world is just irrelevant to you now.
27) 27) dialog: You're not interested in saving the world - all you care about is saving your own pathetic lives.
27) 36) dialog: Ted and Ted - take it easy - this plan will work - everyone’s life will be better if you guys just would -- There’s loud pounding on the front door.
27) 38) dialog: So what do you say - are you gonna do it or not?
27) 39) dialog: No way, dude. You had ten years to write the song --
27) 41) dialog: Fine. He and 55 Yr Old Ted pull out GUNS.
27) 43) dialog: This is our third strike, and we’re not going back to jail, I can tell you that.
27) 44) dialog: Dudes - seriously - you don’t have to pull guns on us.
27) 45) dialog: Oh yah we do. Cause watch what happens if we don’t. They lower their guns. Instantly Bill and Ted try to run away - scrambling desperately for the door - then stoppin when they hear the loud clicks of the guns. 55 YR OLD BILL (CONT’D) See?
27) 46) dialog: I have to admit, you were right. Quickly Ted grabs a guitar and swings it into older Ted - shoving him back into older Bill.
28) 3) dialog: I can’t believe you participated in this charade.
28) 5) dialog: Hang in there, Dad - things will get better at some point. (trying to convince himself) I mean.. They have to. And he and Ted rush down--
28) 8) dialog: Yah, cuz we totally remember everything you’re gonna do. Bill and Ted hesitate, then suddenly dive out a window. EXT. EDDIE VAN HALEN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Bill and Ted roll, leap up, then stop when they see: on t roof, the 55 Yr Old thems are aiming guns at them.
29) 8) dialog: It’s totally true, dude! It’s the future us’s that you want!
29) 9) dialog: Shut up, Bill!
29) 10) dialog: You shut up, Bill! Deacon grabs his radio.
29) 13) dialog: We gotta make a break for it.
29) 15) dialog: That means we gotta do something we can’t possibly remember.

30) 12) dialog: Yes! Go! (seeing something) DUDE - what’s that?
35) 1) dialog: Where are we, dude? 59. They look around in the fog, hearing something guttural a awful in the distance: low, grinding guitar - pounding, t can-like percussion. Death metal - at its darkest. They start toward the music. As they do, they become awar of FACES - HARDENED, HOLLOW-EYED MEN - in shadowy corners staring at them, as if waiting for something, anticipatin As they walk, MORE FACES become visible - denser now - shoulder to shoulder... Then two rows deep... four.. and. They start to hear snippets of a song.
35) 7) text: Bill and Ted, in their mid-60's. Hardened beyond what we would ever have imagined: shaved heads, tattoos, heavily muscled. Bill grinds a guitar, Ted ‘sings’ - ferociously growling out the final words, which sound something like:

35) 11) dialog: It’s very, you know, intense. Passionate. But is it the song?

35) 39) dialog: Ted - do not get drawn into this argument - we talked about this - Suddenly we hear a crackling and see a flash of light in sky. 65 Yr Old Bill looks at 65 Yr Old Ted with urgency. 65 YR OLD BILL (CONT’D) We gotta do this before that future guy shows up and -- Suddenly he freezes. As does 65 Yr Old Ted. And everyone else around them as.. Only Bill and Ted are able to move.

41) 17) dialog: (voice catching) You never did, Bill, you never did. At the same time, on the other side of the room:
41) 22) dialog: Te adoro, Guillermo...
41) 23) dialog: I‘ll never forget you, Bill. Ever. Bill looks over to Ted, who leans close to 95 Yr Old Ted.
41) 32) dialog: Believe us: When the song is played, everything will change.
41) 33) dialog: But how are we gonna play it? We don’t even know what it is.
41) 37) dialog: Dude-- In honor of our late selves, I propose that we get back to the Fabulous Forum and immediately play our song.. Ted nods. Meanwhile: IN HELL —- SAME The cop car cruises along, slowly, demons and anguished s peering in, crowding them, making it difficult to navigat Logan flicks the lights on top and BLIPS the siren a coup times. Then gets on the mic and says, amplified:
42) 7) text: I am “Death.” I knew your son and his friend Bill. We were band mates. 72. We sense in Death a kind of longing - he misses those eve brief good moments; the last (and only) ones of his life.
43) 2) dialog: Ted, you heard us: we have it with us. We've obviously been over-thinking this. We just have to let it happen.
43) 4) dialog: Exactly. Ted nods, not totally convinced, as the guys hurry toward EXT. ARTISTS’ ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS The guys move quickly to Frank.
43) 6) dialog: Our world is about to change, dude. 74. They mount the steps toward the side curtains which block
43) 8) dialog: Ready, Ted?
43) 12) dialog: I don’t know.. Maybe we gotta keep going.
43) 14) dialog: To the mics.
43) 16) dialog: I think we just gotta start.
43) 18) dialog: Ready? One.. Two..
43) 19) dialog: One - two - three - four! Silence. They stand there - look at each other. Nothing coming int their heads.
43) 20) dialog: Let's try again. 75.
43) 22) dialog: Hello? It’s utterly silent in the audience.
46) 3) dialog: What’s going to happen? Rollins indicates for them to follow.
46) 6) dialog: Whoa.. The time line appears to be fraying: bending upward, twisting back in on itself, contorting - like a hose out control or a downed electrical line. The guys move closer. Ted touches it. Suddenly an image pops up: The BUDDHA is running in panic from -- A CAVEMAN - who catches him and CLUBS HIM on the head..
46) 8) dialog: Ted, if I’m not mistaken, I believe the Last Supper was just disrupted by a pair of velocirapters.
46) 16) dialog: Ted --
46) 18) dialog: Ted - it doesn’t matter now. We just gotta get there and get em back. Ted looks at Rollins - then follows Bill as..
47) 0) text: The booth appears on TOP OF A CASTLE WALL and Bill and Te leap out, suddenly stopping and reacting in horror. 80.
47) 3) dialog: Dude, what are we gonna do? There’s not just guards and executioners in the castle - but there’s like armies from all through history outside the castle.
47) 5) dialog: But dude-- we don’t got 30 years to figure it out.
47) 7) dialog: What? What do you mean?
47) 9) dialog: How? We'd have to start when we’re like ten. 81.
47) 11) dialog: (eyes widening) Whoa! Dude! That means, alls we gotta do is--
47) 13) dialog: -- when we actually have 30 years to think about it.. and get ourselves thinking about it! (turns ) Ted - you have had many ingenious ideas which on the surface seem counterintuitive. But this is the counterintuitivest of them all. Let’s go, dude. They jump back into the phone booth, quickly dial. With a flash, the booth disappears and we cut to: INT. BILL’S CHILDHOOD HOUSE - NIGHT VAN HALEN’S “RUNNIN’ WITH THE DEVIL” plays on the tape de as 10 year old Bill and Ted jump on the beds, playing air guitar and singing along. Super: San Dimas, California, 1980 The door opens and 14 YEAR OLD MISSY sticks her head in.
47) 15) dialog: Okay, Missy. She puts her Walkman headphones back on, exits.
47) 17) dialog: I know, remember when we were in kindergarten and she was in third and we asked her to the pumpkin dance? 82. They hear LOUD RAPPING on the window. There, outside, in shadows, desperate and frenetic, are adult Bill and Ted.
47) 19) dialog: Dudes! Let us in! Hurry!
47) 22) dialog: Dudes, listen to us. We're you. We're what you will become.
47) 24) dialog: Not to mention destroying your marriages. And alienating your kids.
47) 26) dialog: You will be lonely beyond description without Joanna, Bill. Especially when mom walks out on you and never comes back.
47) 28) dialog: Yah, alls you gotta do is take the next 30 years to figure out how to save your wives and sons and in-laws from being hanged in 1428! Simple, right?
47) 30) dialog: So-- ARE you gonna spend the next 30 years figuring this out? Are you? Are you?? The two kids, looking like they’re about to cry, are so scared that they cannot even manage tiny little nods. Bil and Ted look at each other.
48) 0) text: Bill and Ted shove their beyond-terrified, whimpering, trembling younger selves into the booth. As Ted dials.. A CAR screeches into Bill’s driveway and a woman (35, pre curly blonde hair) rushes towards them, yelling at the to her lungs--
48) 6) dialog: But the shimmering booth is now dropping-- And just before it disappears, Bill notices that --
48) 9) dialog: Oh, no! I always knew I was responsible for my mom’s leaving.
48) 11) dialog: Ted, I literally just was. Mom!
49) 0) text: The booth lands back on the parapet and.. Bill and Ted dr their 10 year old selves out of it.
49) 1) dialog: Bill: stop crying. Even though Mom's gone, I love you and I will always be there for you.
49) 3) dialog: Okay - I won’t be there for you. But you are gonna have to be there for us.
49) 6) dialog: Good. Now. Here’s what you need to do:
49) 8) dialog: You don’t want that to happen? Spend the next thirty years coming up with a plan to get us out of this. 85.
49) 10) dialog: Now get going. (swatting his young self on the ass) Get.
49) 13) dialog: Even though space-time is unravelling - because of you - it doesn’t matter. You have to save them.
49) 15) dialog: Don’t blow anything.
49) 19) dialog: Yah. I think in our desperation we came on a bit too strong. 86.
49) 21) dialog: I know. I’d always thought that was just some weird nightmare.
49) 23) dialog: Totally. So bad that I musta completely blocked it out.
49) 25) dialog: I know.. Me, too.
49) 27) dialog: What do you mean?
49) 29) dialog: I don’t know. Then I guess we’d know more about what to do.
49) 31) dialog: Dude, you're gonna knit?
49) 33) dialog: Whoa! Suddenly Ted turns, shifts his arm, and - THWOOK-THWOOK - more arrows lodge into the blob. From the CASTLE GUARDS who'd just seen them on the parapet. They look at each other and now burst out a door and into
49) 35) dialog: Dude - you have been thinking about this! That must be why you’ve been making yarn blobs all these years!
49) 37) dialog: I don’t know. I look forward to finding out. Suddenly they both freeze as they HEAR LOUD VOICES IN ANC CHINESE and they turns slowly to see: 2 DOZEN HUNS stand before them, spears raised, with a LEA yelling in Mongolian.
49) 44) dialog: Thanks! And I spent that whole summer and only learned two phrases! I guess I won’t get to use the other one. (then, turning) Hing tak ga.
49) 47) dialog: How we gonna get through all this and over there? They see a HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE moving through the chaos.
49) 48) dialog: Camp Weekhoko - summer of 83! They two of them race to the wagon and slide under - immediately get into “crab-walking” position (legs forwar hands behind, body facing up) and - using the carriage as “cover” -— they crab-walk exceedingly fast - scuttling fo under the carriage. They are very good at it. (And they know it.)
49) 50) dialog: And we were like -- 89.
49) 51) dialog: Nope!
49) 54) dialog: Good idea, dude! They each grab an end of one of the long flagpoles and tr plant the pole, but they both just end up running along t pole with it sliding through their hands until they both plant at the other end of the wood.
49) 56) dialog: I know. I just remembered: we never learned how to pole vault!
49) 60) dialog: I know. And I feel somewhat vulnerable and exposed. Below them HORDES OF SOLDIERS are approaching their long, spindly wooden “legs.”
49) 62) dialog: Dude - what does Uncle Sam say?
49) 63) dialog: (alternating, while waving) Good day citizens! Happy Fourth of July! We are Uncle Sam! We want you.. To stop trying to knock us over!
49) 65) dialog: Well there must be some reason we did it. They hear an o.s. SCREECH and suddenly see TWO HUGE, SCAL REPTILIAN CLAWED FEET rise up over the wall..
49) 67) dialog: Dude - I hate to even ask this question.. But how - and when - could we have learned how to ride pterodactyls?
49) 69) dialog: Oh, yah. They look at each other -- and then just fall to the grou with a double WHUMPF as we hear heavy wings flump away. EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD —- CONTINUOUS They look up. They are at the feet of the executioners -- just yards away from where their wives and children have their heads on blocks.
49) 70) dialog: Joanna! Theo! Elizabeth! Will! Their families look up as Bill and Ted rise, full of confidence. gl.
49) 71) dialog: Stop, executioners.
49) 75) dialog: Apparently 30 years was not quite enough time.
49) 78) dialog: (to Joanna and Theo) We tried to save you - and we failed that, too.
49) 79) dialog: I love you both. The King nods - the hangmen start away from the scaffoldi
49) 81) dialog: (nods ) Cuz I think that’s what we’re about to do. There’s a beat. Will and Theo look at each other.
49) 86) dialog: What? The women nod to the boys, who are looking at their dads. And suddenly... it hits Bill and Ted like a tidal wave. T eyes widen. They look at their sons.
49) 87) dialog: That's your song, isn’t it? Ted wriggles a hand free, manages to reach into his pocke and pull out the now-crumpled sheet of paper that he took from Will the night before. He unfolds it.. And opens it. It’s sheet music. Written o the top are the words “FACE THE MUSIC.”
49) 89) dialog: That future guy was right, there is a song.
49) 101) dialog: Follow him. Deacon does. And now, through the shuddering circuits of time, they swoop and swerve - until finally--
50) 2) dialog: Dude - thank you.
50) 5) dialog: Wait..
50) 11) dialog: Why did you take our families back to
50) 16) dialog: You just play.
50) 21) dialog: Wait. You’ve heard it?
50) 27) dialog: I think we can do that. Joanna and Elizabeth sit at the drums and keyboard. Bill Ted remain just outside the limelight - but there, behind boys.. Who look at each other. Cross to center stage.
50) 34) dialog: 
51) 0) text: 95 year old Bill and Ted, on rocking chairs, smiling, hap strumming guitars together as we PULL AWAY and see.. More GRANDCHILDREN sitting at their feet. And Joanna and Elizabeth - 95 now, too - at their sides. Will and Theo - now 75 - with them. There are GREAT GRANDCHILDREN.. 99. even GREAT GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. The lawn is full, teeming with life. And that voice we heard at the very beginning of the movi belongs to 95 YEAR OLD BILL - who looks out, with 95 YEAR TED - at the generation upon generation of family before them.. They are completing the telling of a long, long story:
51) 1) dialog: And as they looked back on everything they’d done.. Everywhere they'd been.. Everyone they’d known...
51) 3) dialog: Excellent.
51) 4) dialog: Smiling, watching out over all of it.. with Joanna and Elizabeth now sitting at their sides, holding their hands And then cut to:

Wide-eyed, they look at each other.
