8) 18) dialog: Who’s gonna care? Seriously. I’m sick of it. And you know you are too. Bill just looks at Ted - for a long moment - and then he deflates, dropping the facade.
8) 20) dialog: I can’t do this any more. I just can’t. Another pause. Finally Bill looks at Ted.. And nods, agreeing. Then, suddenly, there’s -- 20. A FLASH of LIGHT outside, visible under the garage door.. Then: We HEAR a metallic WHOOSH.. Then FOOTSTEPS. Someone Or something.. is outside.

11) 7) dialog: I just don’t get it.. I mean-- We’ve been trying for 20 years to write the greatest song ever written. How are we gonna do it in 24 hours?
11) 9) dialog: But we do know the song’s gonna exist, right?
11) 11) dialog: I just wish there was a way that we could go into the future and get it from ourselves.
11) 14) dialog: Couldn't we..?
11) 16) dialog: Bill-- if the future of all of reality as we know it is at stake.. isn’t that an extreme emergency? EXT.

13) 5) dialog: Sounds good. (a pause) You wanna do the honors, or should I?
13) 7) dialog: San Dimas, California.. Five years from now. At first, nothing happens. It’s like starting a car that’ been sitting in the garage for 20 years. Then-- the light in the booth flicker on... there is a low humming/buzzing sound. As the antenna comes to life, illuminating the dar shed, the guys look at each other.
13) 8) dialog: Bill..
13) 10) dialog: I have a feeling things are just about to change in a most outstanding way. 29.
13) 12) dialog: Let’s go save the world, dude! ..the booth shimmers and DISAPPEARS and we cut to:

16) 3) dialog: Hey - us’s. Stop. Older Bill and Ted turn - busted. Instantly (and lamely) they try and cover.
16) 5) dialog: We totally forgot you guys were coming! How great to see you!
16) 8) dialog: Really?
16) 9) dialog: Oh, yah - absolutely. 50 Year Old Ted nervously pulls a flask from his hip pock and takes a swig.
16) 11) dialog: And here's the answer: Us being here is humorously ironic.
16) 13) dialog: I remember not necessarily believing it when I you was standing there listening to I me. 32.
16) 15) dialog: No.
16) 17) dialog: (vaguely belligerent) Well I feel sorry for you then.
16) 21) dialog: Ted. Stop drinking for a minute and look me in the eye. Do you have the song? 50 Yr Old Ted almost looks Ted in the eye: at his eyebrow between his eyes.. But not in the eye.
16) 22) dialog: No. In the eye. Look me in the eye, Ted, and tell me you have the song. Otherwise we're gonna leave right now. Do you have the song or do you not? (beat; shakes his head sadly) You totally don’t have the song, do you?
16) 23) dialog: (finishing his entire flask) You know what? Screw you, me.
16) 25) dialog: No - not easy. (to Bill and Ted) YOU didn’t write the song. YOU’RE the ones who're responsible for all of this. And you know something else, pretty boy? 33.
16) 26) dialog: Don’t call me that.
16) 27) dialog: “Don’t call me that.” “Dude.” You drove the princesses away.
16) 30) dialog: What?
16) 32) dialog: No idea. Alls we know is they left a note saying they took Will and Theo back to 1428 and they never came back - and now we've been alone for five years cause you drove our wives away.
16) 33) dialog: Our wives have been gone for five years and you haven’t even tried to talk to them?
16) 36) dialog: Yah well you’re gonna eat your words in about 45 seconds.
16) 38) dialog: Fine. I’m done with you two losers. 34. Ted lunges for himself. Grabs himself --
16) 39) dialog: Why don’t you take some responsibility, you drunk!
16) 40) dialog: Why don’t you go knit a blob?
16) 41) dialog: Hey!
16) 42) dialog: Blob-knitter!
16) 43) dialog: You’re rude! Get your act together, Ted!
16) 44) dialog: You get your act together, Ted! The two Bills grab the two Teds - who are inches from throttling each other - and pull them apart.
16) 50) dialog: (takes Bill’s shoulder) Walk away, dude. Walk away. As Bill and Ted make their way across the lot:
16) 51) dialog: If you don’t like it - go fix it! 35.
16) 53) dialog: Or do something-- cuz our lives suck and it’s your fault.
17) 2) dialog: I know. I can’t believe how much I hated my me.
17) 4) dialog: Yah. What’s the point of any of this is we don’t got our families? The phone booth starts to shimmer - the guys turn, prepar for it to drop. And just as it starts to - Bill and Ted’s eyes widen as they think they see - about feet away across the parking lot: ROLLINS in his silver booth, eyeing them as if studying t But before Bill and Ted have a chance to react (or even b sure what they’ve seen), their booth drops.. and we cut t

18) 9) dialog: Right. And we totally respect that. But first: how did you get here?
18) 12) dialog: Okay. We know you’re thinking very seriously of leaving us. 37.
18) 15) dialog: Full disclosure: we just saw ourselves five years in the future - and you have every reason to leave us because the truth is: we’re going to become everything you don’t want us to be.
18) 17) dialog: Drinking too much --
18) 19) dialog: And - get this: we tried to tell ourselves not to come here. Like we were somehow going to make it worse.
18) 22) dialog: Exactly! Which is why we’re trying to change that by finding the song.
18) 24) dialog: Yah, like all of reality will completely unravel.
18) 26) dialog: Exactly. You can change it if you do the right things at the right times.
18) 31) dialog: I haven’t started yet - I can’t answer that.
18) 33) dialog: What? No! Elizabeth, I‘1l go to AA!
18) 35) dialog: Yet! But I’m about to!
18) 39) dialog: Fine. We’re gonna go. But you need to understand: We’re gonna keep going till we succeed on our mission. 39.
18) 41) dialog: And we’re gonna be together.
19) 0) text: Bill’s at the keypad as a determined Ted closes the door.
19) 1) dialog: Five years forward was clearly not enough. Let’s go ten this time. We certainly will have written the song by then.
21) 0) text: With a flash, the booth arrives in a very nice, hilly sec of town. City lights lay out. The “Bel Air” of San Dimas. Super: San Dimas, California - 10 years in the future Bill and Ted step out of the booth and immediately see:
21) 5) dialog: Yah - and look at what we’re driving. One song did all this?
21) 9) dialog: Why hello younger us’s.
21) 15) dialog: To your futures.
21) 16) dialog: So, then.. I guess you have the song? 41.
21) 17) dialog: Why would we be living like this if we didn't?
21) 18) dialog: And the princesses..?
21) 20) dialog: They're back. (as Bill and Ted audibly exhale) They've been back for a while. And things are better than ever. Huge loads are lifted from Bill and Ted’s shoulders.
21) 21) dialog: Oh, that’s such a relief.
21) 22) dialog: (a hand on Ted’s shoulder) I know you feel that way, Ted. And it’s all gonna be good.
21) 23) dialog: Really?
21) 24) dialog: Really.
21) 26) dialog: But enough prologue. We know the time is slipping by on that crazy clock of yours. This way. 55 Year Old Bill and Ted lead the guys past a SUNKEN LIVI ROOM, where they hear: MR. PRESTON’S VOICE Salutations, boys!
21) 31) text: Bill and Ted follow 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted down a hallway lined with POSTERS, GOLD RECORDS, MAGAZINE COVERS -- all Bill and Ted on the cover. We see: “BILLBOARD NUMBER ONE SONG 131 WEEKS IN A ROW!”

21) 33) dialog: (to 55 Yr Old Bill) Remember that?
21) 35) dialog: And I remember the feeling I had when we us’s showed you us’s into our somewhat nice recording studio. They open a double-door and Bill and Ted follow them into
21) 37) dialog: No way..
21) 39) dialog: So it worked! Our plan worked!
21) 42) dialog: We haven’t even sold one ticket.
21) 43) dialog: Remember: reality is fluid.
21) 46) dialog: That reality will only happen if you don’t take this song back with you. Those guys don't need to exist. Trust me, Ted - it’s amazing how fast life can change when you do the right things.
21) 48) dialog: We will, we will. 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted point to two very plush seats - wh the guys sit.
21) 50) dialog: Okay! Enough talking. Are you ready to face the music? Bill and Ted nod as 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted put the most spectacular pair of over-the-ear EARPHONES on them.. And, with a nod and a wink at the guys, and at each other they move to the soundboard and hit PLAY.
21) 52) dialog: The moment they’ve been waiting for for twenty years is h And - though we only hear the barest, most muffled SENSE music from beneath the headphones - from the very first moment we can tell that it’s not disappointing. A tear is forming in Bill’s eye. Ted looks stunned - deep impressed, but it’s more complex than that. And while this is happening, we CUT AWAY TO:
24) 0) text: Close on the guys as the song ends. Bill’s in tears. Ted’ in disbelief. They slowly pull the headphones off.
24) 2) dialog: Yah.. It’s great. Honestly? I wouldn’t’ve thought we had it in us.
24) 3) dialog: Well you do, and now it’s time to get it out to the world.
24) 4) dialog: I don’t even know how to thank you.
24) 8) dialog: Well... so long, I guess.
24) 9) dialog: Yah, so long. They nod to each other - somehow slightly wary of each ot
25) 0) text: As the guys head out, Bill looks over at Ted, confused.
25) 2) dialog: I just got a weird feeling.
25) 4) dialog: I know, I gotta stop being so suspicious of myself.
25) 8) dialog: Eddie Van Halen?!
25) 15) dialog: Oh no, oh no oh no oh no..
26) 0) text: 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted are undressing - as actors would a a performance. It’s now obvious why their clothes didn’t well: because they’re both wearing Eddie Van Halen’s clot and he’s bigger than Bill and smaller than Ted. Bill removes his WIG - revealing that he is almost totall bald (except a thin strip of Friar Tuck hair at the back)
26) 2) dialog: I hope so. I didn’t like the way I was looking at myself.. Ted downs a long, long swig of Eddie Van Halen’s VODKA.
26) 4) dialog: I don’t believe it..
27) 0) text: 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted raise their glasses in a toast.
27) 1) dialog: Now.. We wait for those other us’s to go back and change everything.
27) 3) dialog: You guys totally lied to us!
27) 7) dialog: It’s Eddie Van Halen’s song, he wrote it. And this is his house.
27) 8) dialog: On what basis would you say something so utterly ridiculous?
27) 9) dialog: Cuz we just ran into him. He’s outside, calling the cops. Older Bill turns to Older Ted, frustrated and annoyed.
27) 11) dialog: I totally thought he came back next week. The two younger guys look at their older selves, shocked. 48.
27) 13) dialog: And you're a fat drunk, Ted.
27) 15) dialog: What on earth were you guys even thinking?? Older Bill and Ted get up, cross to their younger selves.
27) 17) dialog: (nodding) Just cuz you two couldn’t come up with a great song and Eddie Van Halen did doesn’t mean we should be punished for that.
27) 18) dialog: What? That doesn’t even make sense. There is the sound of sirens outside.
27) 21) dialog: Take it now and it will be yours. When Eddie Van Halen comes up with it in 10 years, he'll be stealing it from you.
27) 23) dialog: Really?
27) 25) dialog: We're not gonna do it, forget it.
27) 29) dialog: Your blatant cynicism is both transparent and appalling, Ted.
27) 30) dialog: Fine. Maybe you'll care about this: taking the song is your only chance to get the princesses back.
27) 31) dialog: (as if punched in the gut) You were lying about that.
27) 32) dialog: Of course we were lying. They don’t want to have anything to do with you. Cause they think you’re losers. Which you are. Cause you make bad choices. Like this.
27) 33) dialog: I’m so disappointed in you, me.
27) 34) dialog: I don’t care what you think of me, Ted. Our life is hell and if you don’t go back and change it --
27) 35) dialog: Oh - it’s all about you --
27) 40) dialog: And we're not gonna build a fake future on one that’s not even ours. 55 Yr Old Bill and Ted look at each other.
27) 42) dialog: Then we’ll do it. We’ll take the song, and the booth, and we’ll go back.
27) 47) dialog: You dicks.
28) 7) dialog: You guys can’t get away from us, you know.
29) 4) dialog: (yells) Deacon! It’s not me!
29) 5) dialog: Yes, Deacon! It totally IS me!
29) 7) dialog: This me talking is from ten years ago, and I don’t have anything to do with this!
29) 14) dialog: Yah, but how? They’re us - they remember everything we’re gonna do.
29) 16) dialog: How do we do that? Ted thinks a moment, then..
29) 17) dialog: Dude - check it out. Ted pulls his shirt up so his head is hidden. His arms flail.
29) 18) dialog: I totally can’t see where I am! Bill nods - does the exact same thing. And now..
29) 21) dialog: I was hoping those younger us’s wouldn't think of it this time.
29) 24) dialog: No idea! That’s the point! 54. They spin, sprinting in odd, random, chaotic, arbitrary directions - like pinballs - as they rush out the gate an start spinning down the alley.. Falling at times, bumping into each other, into walls.. Tripping, getting up.. For a moment Bill’s shirt drops.
29) 28) dialog: 
29) 33) dialog: You haven’t heard the last of us! We’re gonna get you, Bill and Ted! Suddenly cops come out, guns drawn.
29) 35) dialog: Dude, there is no way I’m going back to jail.
30) 0) text: Bill and Ted tumble to a stop against a wall and Bill and dizzily pull their shirts down.
30) 2) dialog: Yah - maybe we should always not know what we're doing.

30) 9) dialog: Dude - where are we going?
30) 11) dialog: Ten more years?
30) 13) text: For a BRIEF INSTANT they think they see ROLLINS again - leaning against his silver phone booth across the street. But suddenly they’re AWASH IN BRIGHT LIGHT - from the HELICOPTER above them - as well as from -- DEACON’S POLICE CAR Which roars up - spotlight fixed on them. LOGAN’S VOICE (ON SPEAKER) TED! Step out of that phone booth, Ted!
30) 14) dialog: Sorry dad! I’m not the me you want anyway! LOGAN’S VOICE I don’t want to hear it Ted! Come out right now!! Bill finishes dialing and the booth starts to shimmer.. FROM WITHIN DEACON’S POLICE CAR Logan squints into the bright light: 57.

35) 21) dialog: Our friends here have been waiting for ten years for the chance to kick your asses.
35) 23) dialog: No way.
35) 24) dialog: Way, guy.
35) 25) dialog: “Guy?” You don’t even know my name?
35) 26) dialog: I don’t care what your name is. 61. Prisoners pull out pipes, blades-- start to close in.
35) 28) dialog: Yah - cuz if you do, then you totally won't exist.
35) 30) dialog: That is most nihilistic.
35) 32) dialog: Stop saying that. Knives go up to Bill and Ted’s throats.
35) 33) dialog: See you in hell, guy.
35) 34) dialog: Okay. Um. I don’t want to be argumentative here. But I don’t think there could be two souls of the same person in one hell.
35) 35) dialog: Well, there’s two of us here.
35) 37) dialog: “Oh, I’m Ted and I’m a philosophical monist!”
35) 38) dialog: Well, I am! And I knew you knew my name!
35) 42) dialog: Bad.
35) 45) dialog: Sorry, dude..
35) 47) dialog: How? We keep going further and further into the future and things keep getting worse and worse. (looking at his older self) I don’t even recognize myself anymore.
35) 50) dialog: We've like travelled through our whole lives almost..
35) 52) dialog: Well, I guess not our whole lives..
35) 54) dialog: Like.. our end?
35) 57) dialog: I went out of my way to make sure it was shorter.
35) 59) dialog: Maybe so - but he was so wrong! And I told you to stop me!
39) 0) text: We’re outside a REST HOME as - FLASH - the shimmering pho booth appears and lands. Bill and Ted get out, approach t front door. Super: San Dimas, California, 50 Years In the Future
40) 0) text: Bill and Ted enter, turn and go down a hallway toward an door backlit with light. They cross and enter --
41) 0) text: -- Where they step in and see.. in two beds, TWO VERY, VE OLD MEN-- 95 YEAR OLD BILL AND TED. Ancient, frail, in the final moments of their lives. They look up with grateful recognition as Bill and Ted enter.
41) 1) dialog: (gently) How’s it goin’?
41) 2) dialog: All I can say is we’re so glad you’re finally here.
41) 4) dialog: So then-- there is a song?
41) 5) dialog: As it turns out, there is.
41) 8) dialog: Is it.. good? 68.
41) 12) dialog: Is there.. a title? The ancient thems look at each other.. Then back at the g
41) 14) dialog: ..-Face the Music. The guys take this in. It’s clear it’s the truth. Exchanging a look, Bill and Ted separate.
41) 18) dialog: I feel like I never really knew you, Ted.
41) 19) dialog: I know, that’s my fault. I never truly opened myself up to you. The truth is-- I looked at you and saw myself.
41) 20) dialog: I know, me too.
41) 21) dialog: But now, as I reach the end, there’s so much that I want to say to you. 69. We hear crying and MOVE BACK TO THE BILLS. Bill is huggin his ancient, dying self, whose eyes are dimming.
41) 24) dialog: There is one more thing we need to ask you.
41) 25) dialog: I know. Elizabeth and Joanna. (a pause; voice catching) We haven't seen them since the day they left.
41) 26) dialog: Oh no, please don’t say that.
41) 27) dialog: But I’m afraid it’s true.
41) 28) dialog: Does it have to be that way? 95 Yr Old Ted takes Ted’s hand.
41) 29) dialog: Unless you two change it.
41) 30) dialog: Can we?
41) 31) dialog: Of course you can. None of this has to happen.
41) 34) dialog: Its with you. It’s with you right now.
41) 35) dialog: Where? 70. 95 Yr Old Ted starts to point - but his hand drops. He lo at ancient Bill. They both nod ever-so-slightly, then loo back at their younger selves and say:
42) 0) text: Logan stands about a head or two ABOVE the hunched-over TORMENTED SOULS as TWO FEARSOME DEMONS approach and growl
43) 1) dialog: I still don’t understand.. How are we gonna play the greatest song ever written when we don’t even know it?
43) 3) dialog: So we’re just gonna make it up as we go along?
43) 9) dialog: Ready, Bill. And they stride past a curtain and onto..
43) 11) dialog: Dude.. What’s going on?
43) 13) dialog: Going... where?
43) 15) dialog: There are no mics.
43) 17) dialog: Okay. I guess.
43) 19) dialog: One - two - three - four! Silence. They stand there - look at each other. Nothing coming int their heads.
43) 21) dialog: Okay. One - two - three - four. Still nothing. Beat. They walk closer to the center of the stage. It’s like a very, very bad dream.
43) 23) dialog: Hello, Fabulous Forum? More silence. A beat. Ted turns to the side:
43) 24) dialog: Um.. Could we have the house lights up? A beat later - a loud KA-CHUNK, and the guys stare out at
43) 27) dialog: I don’t understand... DING DING DING, a warning light goes off on the timepiece TWO MINUTES LEFT. Suddenly the guys feel something strang Their feet are starting to move. They gape at each other terrified - as.. They begin sliding backwards - WHAM - into the phone boot Which lights up automatically and quickly SHOOTS DOWN thr the pavement and is gone. Revealing: ROLLINS, by his booth, watching. He steps back inside.. a WHOOSH.. It’s gone, too. 76.
46) 6) dialog: Whoa.. The time line appears to be fraying: bending upward, twisting back in on itself, contorting - like a hose out control or a downed electrical line. The guys move closer. Ted touches it. Suddenly an image pops up: The BUDDHA is running in panic from -- A CAVEMAN - who catches him and CLUBS HIM on the head..
46) 7) dialog: Whoooaaaa.. Dude-- the Buddha just got clubbed by a caveman. Bill moves forward, touches the timeline. We see the Last Supper -- 12 people sitting in a torch-lit tent. Suddenly two OMINOUS SHADOWS appear on the tent wall and we HEAR a pair of loud SCREECHES as a_FEARSOME CLAW suddenly tears tent. The 12 disciples leap and run as -- Bill turns to Ted: 79.
46) 9) dialog: Oh, no.. They cross together.. Look at the line.
46) 10) dialog: Dude. It’s like everything is just blending together.
46) 12) dialog: It’s in 1400 now.. Does that mean it’s about to hit..? The guys look at each other, then look toward medieval ti the 1400's - suddenly grasping something -
46) 13) dialog: You brought our families there.
46) 15) dialog: Why?
46) 17) dialog: Why would you do that?
47) 1) dialog: Dude - look. WITHIN THE CASTLE, guarded by dozens and dozens of fearso looking KNIGHTS in armor who are brandishing swords-- Joanna, Elizabeth, Will, Theo - as well as the Duke and Duchess - are bound and are being led along SCAFFOLDING toward 6 NOOSES. The King stands nearby and shouts out over the chaos:
47) 4) dialog: I know. And we got like 30 seconds to figure it out and we’d need like 30 years!
47) 6) dialog: (a beat) We don’t.
47) 8) dialog: We don’t - cause we’re just starting to think about it now. But what if we start thinking about it thirty years ago?
47) 10) dialog: Exactly!
47) 12) dialog: --go back and find ourselves when we're ten --
47) 16) dialog: Dude, your babysitter is cute.
47) 20) dialog: Wh-who are you?
47) 21) dialog: Don’t worry! We’re you, it’s fine! The boys - terrified - turn and try to run out - but Bill Ted open the window and rush in and catch them at the doo
47) 23) dialog: Yah - and we’re here to prevent you from destroying time and space as we know it.
47) 25) dialog: Elizabeth is gonna be the love of your life, Ted, and you’re gonna blow it. And Will and Theo will think you two are completely blind idiots, which you are.
47) 27) dialog: But! Here’s the good news: It doesn’t have to happen.
47) 29) dialog: But you gotta start now - like right now. The two boys are too stunned and scared to speak. Bill an Ted kneel down, get right in their own faces. 83.
47) 31) dialog: Dude, they’re not getting it. What do we do?
48) 0) text: Bill and Ted shove their beyond-terrified, whimpering, trembling younger selves into the booth. As Ted dials.. A CAR screeches into Bill’s driveway and a woman (35, pre curly blonde hair) rushes towards them, yelling at the to her lungs--
48) 10) dialog: Dude, you weren't. 84.
49) 0) text: The booth lands back on the parapet and.. Bill and Ted dr their 10 year old selves out of it.
49) 2) dialog: Dude - you can’t promise that.
49) 4) dialog: Yah. You guys have to see this. Gradually the terrified 10 year olds open their eyes.
49) 5) dialog: Now. Is this burned on your brain? The kids stare down at the confusion: royal guards on the inside - soldiers from all of time on the outside, climbi the walls, clambering to get in. Their younger selves give horrified nods.
49) 7) dialog: See those people down there? Those are your beloved wives and sons - and that’s their grandparents. They’re about to be hung by their necks till they’re dead.
49) 9) dialog: And do it fast. Cause we only got about thirty seconds and we don’t have any idea what to do.
49) 11) dialog: (shoving himself roughly)
49) 14) dialog: So don’t blow it.
49) 16) dialog: Do everything right, always. You two - alone - are responsible for saving everything. Okay? The booth is gone. Alerting the attention of TWO GUARDS WITH BOWS AND ARROWS, who turn, on the parapet, an start toward.. Bill and Ted - who quickly spot--
49) 18) dialog: I don’t think that went particularly well.
49) 20) dialog: I know, midway through, I started to totally remember this whole thing from when it happened to us.
49) 22) dialog: Yah - the worst nightmare of all time.
49) 24) dialog: But now that we’re talking about it - it’s like in the back of my mind, I’ve always been thinking about it.
49) 26) dialog: Dude. Is it even possible that it worked?
49) 28) dialog: Well.. What if we now have been thinking about this - subconsciously - for thirty years?
49) 30) dialog: Yah. Like.. I don’t know.. Ted reaches into his jacket packet and pulls out the LARG BLOB OF YARN.
49) 32) dialog: I don’t think so. I think I’m gonna just do.. This. Ted holds the yarn blob right in front of Bill - AND INSTANTLY - there’s a “THWOOK” - and A SPEEDING ARROW lod right in the blob - and not into Bill. 87.
49) 33) dialog: Whoa! Suddenly Ted turns, shifts his arm, and - THWOOK-THWOOK - more arrows lodge into the blob. From the CASTLE GUARDS who'd just seen them on the parapet. They look at each other and now burst out a door and into
49) 36) dialog: Whoa! Yah! I wonder what you’ve been thinking about?
49) 39) dialog: Whoa... Ted yanks a knitting needle, holds it “threateningly.” It does nothing. The Huns come closer. Suddenly -- AN OFFSCREEN VOICE YELLS LOUDLY IN ANCIENT MONGOLIAN.
49) 41) dialog: Whoa.. I didn’t even see who said that. 88. Bill looks at TED with a little smile. And then, with his mouth completely closed, he says:
49) 43) dialog: Whoa! I’m not sure what’s more impressive: your ventriloquism, or your use of ancient Mongolian.
49) 46) dialog: (pointing) Our families are just on the other side of that wall. Indeed - there’s a LARGE CASTLE WALL just on the other si of this courtyard.
49) 48) dialog: Camp Weekhoko - summer of 83! They two of them race to the wagon and slide under - immediately get into “crab-walking” position (legs forwar hands behind, body facing up) and - using the carriage as “cover” -— they crab-walk exceedingly fast - scuttling fo under the carriage. They are very good at it. (And they know it.)
49) 49) dialog: Dude - that whole summer - all the counselors were like “don’t you wanna do anything besides crab-walk?”
49) 51) dialog: Nope!
49) 52) dialog: Now we know why. And they roll out - rise. Look at the wall - and then loo at TWO FELLED FLAG POLES which have just been knocked fro the walls.
49) 53) dialog: Pole vault!
49) 55) dialog: Dude.
49) 57) dialog: Then why did we think these poles were a good idea? The guys look at the long wooden sticks they are holding their hands.
49) 59) dialog: I’m not sure this was such a good idea either. We’re still not high enough to get over the wall.
49) 61) dialog: Maybe we should wave to them like Uncle Sam. 90.
49) 63) dialog: (alternating, while waving) Good day citizens! Happy Fourth of July! We are Uncle Sam! We want you.. To stop trying to knock us over!
49) 64) dialog: Dude - we have to remember to not have this misguided stilt-walking plan. Below them SOLDIERS whack the stilts. The guys teeter.
49) 66) dialog: That’s why! They reach up and grab the legs. Now look up and see the UNDERBELLY of a huge scaly flying beast. Below - the shadow of a PTERODACTYL moves toward the wall the guys rise up..
49) 68) dialog: I’m not sure we did, dude.
49) 70) dialog: Joanna! Theo! Elizabeth! Will! Their families look up as Bill and Ted rise, full of confidence. gl.
49) 72) dialog: Unhand our families. Now.
49) 77) dialog: Liz.. Will.. I’m sorry. We tried to save the world - but we failed.
49) 79) dialog: I love you both. The King nods - the hangmen start away from the scaffoldi
49) 80) dialog: I must say - it’s darkly ironic that the name of the song we supposedly wrote is “Face the Music”..
49) 83) dialog: Face the Music. 92. Now the women look at each other.. then at Bill and Ted.. grasping something. Below, the King gets in position for the execution.
49) 86) dialog: What? The women nod to the boys, who are looking at their dads. And suddenly... it hits Bill and Ted like a tidal wave. T eyes widen. They look at their sons.
49) 88) dialog: I’ve had it in my pocket the whole time. Now, below, the King gives a signal. The executioners mov toward the lever - and begin to pull it..
49) 90) dialog: I just kinda wish we’d figured this out a bit sooner. They are all about to hang... when suddenly, from outside castle, we hear:
49) 92) dialog: Dad? What are you doing here?
49) 97) dialog: The Fabulous Forum! Deacon cranks the wheel - the car shakes violently - as i crossing a bridge that’s an the brink of giving out.
49) 100) dialog: It’s help. 94.
50) 1) dialog: Duck! And have to squat to avoid a pack of PIRATES who are firi muskets at come COWBOYS.. They all start moving with their families. As they pass t silver booth-- Rollins emerges - joining them. He carries two large case
50) 3) dialog: Do you think it’s too late?
50) 6) dialog: Is your dad.. Rufus? Rollins nods. And they all start through--
50) 10) dialog: Okay - dude - you have to tell us now..
50) 19) dialog: They’re yours now. The boys look at their moms. 96.
50) 25) dialog: I’m not sure I know it.
50) 37) dialog: You got seven moms, dude! And now the music really kicks in. And the guys’ 95 year old selves couldn’t have possibly b more correct when they said Bill and Ted would never feel prouder in their lives. The family plays the song. The crowd is cheering, arms in the air, exultant, thrilled, singing along-- present at t pivotal moment of history and feeling it.
51) 0) text: 95 year old Bill and Ted, on rocking chairs, smiling, hap strumming guitars together as we PULL AWAY and see.. More GRANDCHILDREN sitting at their feet. And Joanna and Elizabeth - 95 now, too - at their sides. Will and Theo - now 75 - with them. There are GREAT GRANDCHILDREN.. 99. even GREAT GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. The lawn is full, teeming with life. And that voice we heard at the very beginning of the movi belongs to 95 YEAR OLD BILL - who looks out, with 95 YEAR TED - at the generation upon generation of family before them.. They are completing the telling of a long, long story:
51) 2) dialog: There was only one word to describe it. There’s a pause. The old men look at each other - then ou at their children and their children’s children.. And smile. And say - quietly - and with deep conviction:
51) 3) dialog: Excellent.
51) 4) dialog: Smiling, watching out over all of it.. with Joanna and Elizabeth now sitting at their sides, holding their hands And then cut to:
53) 0) text: --FLASH. The PHONE BOOTH lands in the lawn of Bill’s childhood home. And out of it step.. 10 year old Bill and Ted. Who turn - sort of shell-shocke but now able to grasp the enormity of what just happened. They turn. Gradually. And take in the thing that just brought them here.. the PHONE BOOTH. 100. Wide-eyed, they look at each other.
