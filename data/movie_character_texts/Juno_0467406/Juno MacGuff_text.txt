And the receptionist tried to give  me these weird condoms that looked  like grape suckers, and she told me  about her boyfriend's pie balls, and  Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told  me the baby had fingernails.  Fingernails!
33) 4) dialog: I'm staying pregnant, Le.
33) 6) dialog: What does that even mean? Anyway, I  got to thinking on the way over. I  was thinking maybe I could give the  baby to somebody who actually likes  that kind of thing. You know, like a  woman with a bum ovary or something.  Or some nice lesbos.
33) 8) dialog: I know. Maybe they'll canonize me  for being so selfless.

34) 9) dialog: I was thinking a graphic designer,  mid-thirties, and his cool Asian  wife who dresses awesome and plays  bass. But I'm trying to not be too  particular.

56) 17) dialog: I want Mark and Vanessa to be  surprised, and if I know, I won't be  able to keep myself from telling  them and ruining the whole thing.
56) 19) dialog: No, they're the people who are  adopting the baby.
56) 23) text: Juno, Leah and Bren become immediately defensive.
56) 24) dialog: How do you know I'm so poisonous?  Like, what if the adoptive parents  turn out to be evil molesters?

59) 5) dialog: Right. I hear they can be kind of a  time-suck.

60) 0) text: Mark leads Juno into the kitchen, where he pours two drin The STEREO blares in the background.
60) 1) dialog: Why aren't you at work?

60) 7) dialog: Oh.
60) 9) dialog: (singing) Titanium Power! Get more snatch by  the batch!
60) 11) dialog: You're kind of a sellout, aren't  you? What would the Melvins say?

61) 3) dialog: Behold, good sir! The very first  photo of your future child.
61) 6) dialog: I think it kind of looks like my  friend, Paulie.
61) 8) dialog: No, he's the dad.
61) 11) dialog: The doctor can tell, but I decided  not to know. I want it to be a big  surprise.
61) 13) dialog: That's what you think. I drink tons  of booze so you might get one of  those scary neuter-babies that's  born without junk.
61) 15) dialog: You know... it's parts...
61) 17) dialog: (teasing) Yeah?
61) 19) dialog: Well don't worry about it. My stepmom  is forcing me to eat really healthy.  She won't even let me stand in front  of the microwave or eat red M&amp;Ms.  Hope you're ready.
61) 22) text: A new SONG has begun. Mark closes his eyes in ecstasy and walks toward the stereo. Juno follows him toward the sour of the music, looking perplexed by how happy he is.
61) 23) dialog: What is it?
61) 25) dialog: (excited) I've heard the Carpenters before.  Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not  unlike the White Stripes.

61) 29) dialog: Hey, I like this.
61) 31) dialog: You don't have to do that.
61) 33) dialog: I didn't. But it's a three-way tie  between the Stooges, Patti Smith and  the Runaways.
61) 35) text: He gestures at Juno's burgeoning paunch. Mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulli CD's. He's got a Carpenter's disc, the "No Alternative"  charity compilation, and Mother Love Bone. Juno spots a VHS TAPE on the coffee table and picks it up

62) 3) text: He raises his mug in a toast and Juno clinks it awkwardly
62) 4) dialog: So, have you and Vanessa thought of  a name for the baby yet?
62) 6) dialog: (aghast) Madison? Isn't that kind of... I  don't know, gay?
62) 8) dialog: My dad went through this phase where  he was obsessed with Greek and Roman  mythology. He named me after Zeus's  wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays,  but I'm pretty sure Juno was his  only wife. She was supposed to be  really beautiful but really mean.  Like Diana Ross.
62) 10) dialog: Uh, thanks.
62) 12) dialog: I weighed my options. But after all  this, I'm glad I didn't, you know,  get rid of it. I want to have it.  For you guys.

63) 11) dialog: Sure. It's the right size and  everything. I even saw its phalanges  today! Check this...
63) 14) dialog: This is the baby. Your baby.
63) 17) dialog: (kindly) Doesn't it look like it's waving?  It's kind of like it's saying "Hi,  Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
63) 20) dialog: I came over as soon as I got that  cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis.  My stepmom verbally abused the  ultrasound tech so we were escorted  off the premises.
63) 23) dialog: See? Nothing to worry about.
64) 0) text: Vanessa and Mark walk Juno out. Juno peers at some shoppi bags from various kids stores.
64) 1) dialog: Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
64) 4) dialog: I thought people got all that stuff  at baby showers. When my stepmom had  my sister I remember she got about a  million presents. They were all lame  though, so I wasn't jealous.
64) 6) dialog: Why?
64) 8) dialog: What do you mean? You mean... (aghast) Do you think I'm going to flake out  on you?
64) 10) text: Juno glances at Mark and again at Vanessa. Vanessa looks  embarrassed.
64) 12) dialog: You should have gone to China. I  heard they give away babies like  free iPods. They shoot 'em out of  those T-shirt guns at sports events.
64) 14) dialog: Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they  figure nothing worse could happen to  me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was  nice seeing you guys again.

66) 2) dialog: I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark  and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I  wound up staying for a couple of  hours.
66) 4) dialog: They said they wanted to know about  this stuff. They said to keep them  updated, so I did!
66) 6) dialog: I don't know, I just did. And while  we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark  and I watched The Wizard of Gore and  he burned me some CDs of weird music.  He's kind of cool.
66) 9) dialog: Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're  the one overstepping boundaries.  You're acting like you're the one  who has to go through this and get  huge and push a baby out of your vag  for someone else. Besides, who cares  if he's married? I can have friends  who are married.
66) 11) dialog: You don't know anything about me!
66) 14) dialog: (gesturing to the  magazine) We don't even have a dog!

67) 3) dialog: I borrowed Paulie's physics notes in  school today. I'm pretty sure he  needs them back, or his grade could  plummet to an A minus.
67) 5) text: She steals another glance at Juno's belly.
68) 0) text: Bleeker's mom escorts Juno wordlessly up the stairs and d the hallway to Paulie's bedroom. Juno discreetly tries to charge ahead of her, but her expanding middle prevents he from getting past Bleeker's mom. They share an extremely  awkward moment wedged side-by-side in the narrow hallway. Bleecker's mom nudges past Juno and knocks on Bleeker's  bedroom door. The door has a cheesy racecar-themed decora hanging on it that says PAULIE'S VRROOOM! It looks like  something a 5-year old might have.
69) 0) text: Paulie is on the floor surrounded by old quizzes, studyin like the tortured brainiac he is. Mrs. Bleeker opens the  bedroom door. Juno appears. Paulie jumps, startled.

71) 9) text: Juno walks over to the bed and sits down next to Bleeker.
71) 10) dialog: I'm going to really start looking  like a dork soon. Will you still  think I'm cute if I'm huge?
71) 12) text: Juno is caught off guard by his sincerity.
71) 13) dialog: Jesus, Bleek.
71) 15) text: The song playing ends, and another one begins. It's "the  song," the track that Bleeker and Juno both recognize fro the infamous night in the basement.
71) 17) dialog: Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new  drumhead we should be good to go.
71) 19) dialog: Were we together?
71) 22) dialog: What about Katrina De Voort? You  could go out with Katrina De Voort.

83) 12) dialog: Whatever. Have fun at the prom with  Soupy Sales. I'm sure I can think of  something way more cool to do that  night. Like I could pumice my feet,  or go to Bren's dumb Unitarian church,  or get hit by a ten-ton truck full  of hot garbage juice. All those things  would be exponentially cooler than  going to the prom with you.
83) 15) dialog: (turning around) What?
83) 17) dialog: That's not how our thing works! I  hurl the accusations and you talk me  down, remember?

87) 53) dialog: Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault?  Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
