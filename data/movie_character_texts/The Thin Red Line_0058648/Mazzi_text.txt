Fife sits watching a pair of blue butterflies bounce above the grass tops. As he gets himse ready, he can hardly believe what is happening to him.

63) 5) dialog: Help! Help! Help! To his eternal shame, it is Tills who comes back for him. Eyes glaring wildly also, running hurriedly in a crouch, comes up, surveys the scene, and frees him. Mazzi has bee pushing and plunging forward all the time. Tills merely shoves him backward two feet and the snag comes free. The making a lip-lifting mock of a grin, he spits brown from quid in his jaw, and runs on.

74) 6) dialog: (getting up drunkenly) All right, by God I will. He marches out of the tent and staggers through the coco palms toward Band's HQ tent. The others follow him at a distance, sniggering happily, content to let him take the dangerous chance alone. All, that is, except Carni,' who cannot get out of his bed.

Come out and find out what the men in your outfit think of you, Band! You want to know what we think of you? Glory hunter! Come on, volunteer us for somethin' else! From Band's blacked-out tent just the faintest hint of li creeps out to the waiting men outside. Inside the tent nothing seems to move. Other men have begun to gather aro too now, their grinning teeth white in the bright moonlig Aware of them, Mazzi rages on, marching back and forth an swinging his skinny arms, compounding insult and profanit with great artistry.

75) 10) dialog: I sure got him told! I sure got him told! And he never said one word back! Then suddenly he sees Tills's mocking, lip-lifting face square in front of him and is startled into a new hollow apathy. He tries to brave it out, chuckling hollowly to h new satellite Carni.
75) 11) dialog: I sure got him told!
75) 14) dialog: Don't you tell no lies, Tills!
