There they res waiting for orders from Battalion. Didn't the Army know t were no Japanese here? 18. If they failed to realize this, what else don't they know Two SCOUTS come scampering out of the grove up ahead and report to Capt. Stein.

21) 1) dialog: Well, Witt! By God! How are you! A troublemaker with a touchy sense of honor, Witt has bee busted several times and twice sent to the stockade on a summary court-martial. This makes him something of a roma hero to Fife, who considers him the only friend besides B that he has in the whole regiment. He rushes over to shak hands, overjoyed to see him. Witt is just as glad, in his way. All his friends are in C-for-Charlie, and he likes t reputation he enjoys here. As Witt sees it, everybody kno he loves C-for-Charlie and for Welsh to ship him out, whi knowing this, only proves his total contempt for Welsh correct.
21) 2) dialog: How'd you find us? You AWOL? I been asking around about you every day, trying to find out were you were. I thought you were in the brig. How long you been hanging around here?

21) 8) dialog: Well, I think if you went around to Capt. Stein and told him how you feel, he'd arrange a transfer back for you. Bugger knows how good a soldier you are. Never was a question of that.

Staggering in his pack, Fife lurches out onto the edge of road. He does not shut up. Stein does not know what to do is up to him to make an issue or not make one. Fife is past the point of caring. He decides to do nothin Nobody else seems to care, or pays much attention, they a all too tired. Looking up the road he sees a Melanesian native with a haunted look hurrying past in the opposite direction, away from the front. Then he sees that Sgt. We is watching, a vague smile on his face.

27) 9) dialog: Hey, First, is this where you guys’ve decided to dig in? I thought I'd dig in over here with you guys, if it was. I mean, I guess it's as good a place as any. He unslings his pack. Welsh stops his unbuckling of strap and looks up at Fife with a face as expressionless as granite.

35) 26) dialog: Yes, sir. He’s right here. (to Stein) Colonel Tall wants you. Stein lies down and takes the phone. Despite the din, bot and Fife beside him can hear the colonel clearly. Stein h been caught off guard; 54. he did not expect to be called upon to offer explanations soon. What he hears astounds him to speechlessness.
37) 55) dialog: By God! Hello, Witt! What’re you doing here? True to his promise of a few days before, Witt passes his narrow eyes across his friend as if Fife did not exist. T come to rest on Welsh again. Welsh seems to peer into him
38) 0) text: Stein begins to move forward. Patches of flesh on his fac twitch uncontrollably. From behind the third swell he wil mount the attack and observe it too. He wonders if the me can tell his nerves are wearing thin. In the first place can never be sure that what he is doing is right, might n be done better and with less cost in some other way. Dang flickers and blinks in the air like a faulty neon tube. Whenever he stands up he might be struck by a bullet Whenever he moves a few feet he might be moving under a descending mortar shell. He is turning these things over in his mind when Fife hol the phone up to his ear. He is dumbfounded to hear the Colonel shouting at him that he is too far to the right. 66.

40) 7) dialog: I don't know. It don't hurt. Except when I touch it.
40) 9) dialog: I-I don't know. Then, suddenly, Fife realizes that he is free. He does no have to stay here any more. He is released. He can simply up and walk away -- provided he is able -- with honor, without anyone being able to say he is a coward or court- martialing him.

There seem be hundreds of people running everywhere, all shouting at another. An orderly attaches a colored tag to Fife's jack A DOCTOR leans over and looks into Fife's eyes and then s his fingers in front of them.

48) 2) dialog: Yes, sir, Doc. Doc HAINES I remember you from when you went up to Post Hospital for that appendectomy. How did that ever turn out? Everything all right now? What have we here now? Head wound, hunh? Can you sit up?
48) 3) dialog: Sure! Sure! Doc HAINES Easy. Take it easy. You've lost a little blood there. Let's have a look-see. This’ll hurt a little bit now... You're lucky. It isn't fractured. You may have, I think what we call a greenstick fracture, sort of crack, not a break. In any case, there's no foreign objects inside. In a week or so, you'll be all ready to go again.
48) 4) dialog: Then -- you don't think I'll be evacuated. Or anything like that. Doc HAINES I wouldn't think so.
48) 5) dialog: Then I can walk all right now. Doc HAINES Do anything you like. Except you should take it easy for a day or two. 108.
48) 6) dialog: (bitterly) Thanks, Doc.
48) 8) dialog: Sure. As soon as this one’s over, there'll be another one. Right after. From his blood-caked face he grins, feeling it draw his cheeks. He knows he makes a good picture of a wounded man anyway.
48) 10) dialog: It's not your problem. If a guy ain't hurt bad enough to ship out, you can't ship him out, can you? I better go. Doc HAINES Good luck, son. Fife waves his hand without looking back.

49) 11) dialog: He was all right when I left! He's prob'ly dead too by now! He goes off. Then suddenly, for no reason, he begins to blubber again. Falling down on his knees behind a truck, beats his fists in the mud, beside himself. At the ledge the high racketing which has hung in the air most of the day ceased some time ago, and only sporadic R FIRE can be heard now in the distance. As twilight passes into night, the officers discuss the prospects of tomorro and the men clean their weapons. Beneath a canopy of hard, bright stars, the men struggle get a few hours' sleep. Sgt.

51) 29) dialog: Stein'll never let me go. Anyway, I could never ask him.
51) 31) dialog: Yeah. I know, I know. 114. He twists his neck from side to side and peers around the high, dim, hot-aired tent. A single orderly moves down th line of wounded men, sleeping now, each in a cocoon of mosquito netting.
51) 32) dialog: I don't want to let them down. They never let me down. I'd feel like I was hiding. He walks off. He might as well get it over with. If he wa until morning, he might find reasons not to.

Fife sits watching a pair of blue butterflies bounce above the grass tops. As he gets himse ready, he can hardly believe what is happening to him.

It sends Weld rolling away wild to the ground, where he props himself on his elbows, shak his head. When he rolls over to sit up, Fife dives on him It is as though a sudden scrambled lightning bolt of happ maleness and joyous masculinity has g lit Fife's skull, blinding him with glory. On top of the groggy Weld on the ground, he cuffs and pummels.

Seeing Witt, he throws himself on the ground and digs like a badger. Other Japanese soldiers dash forward to squeeze the trigger. One by one Witt shoots them down; quickly, decisively, with daring and skill. Soon mortar rounds begin to fall among the enemy soldiers. He looks b over his shoulder.
