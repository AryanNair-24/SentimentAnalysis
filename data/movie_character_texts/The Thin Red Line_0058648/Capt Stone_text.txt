113) 1) dialog: You know, of course, that you do not have to accede to this request. (MORE)
113) 4) dialog: I don't understand. Why do you want to do that?
113) 6) dialog: Well, there are all sort of attitudes and opinions, I guess. That's what makes the world go round. You've got nothing to be ashamed of.
113) 8) dialog: I certainly will. Bell turns to go.
113) 9) dialog: Oh, Bell! (holding out a sheaf of papers) This came in yesterday, for you. I held it up a little because I wanted to write my own endorsement. (MORE)
113) 12) dialog: Really. I assumed that you would want to accept it. I've already written my endorsement.

If any of you guys want to see me about anything, anything at all, you'll find I m available. On the other hand, I'm gonna be busy makin’ a living for this family, so if it's not important, maybe mother can handle it. That's all, except for one more thing. We're into training now, as all of you know. You all know what kind of training it is, too. Well, I'm making this training just as tough on everybody as I possibly can. Including me. So expect it. Now that's all -- Except one more thing. It'll be a long time before we get home. The war is not going to be over by next Christmas. We'll probably have to circle the world, and you 11 probably go back by way of New York. So let's stick together. (MORE)
