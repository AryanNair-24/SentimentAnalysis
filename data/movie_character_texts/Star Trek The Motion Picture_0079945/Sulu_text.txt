34) 0) text: A confusion of activity and VOICES. Pieces o equip- ment in a state of disarray: consoles open, fiber optic tubes unconnected, viewing screens dismantled. It's a frantic, desperate scene -- a ship and crew to- tally unprepared. In the midst of this: ALIEN ensign is assisting UHURA (Lt. Comdr. stripes)deftly working her communications station, AD LIBBING "... Hailing frequency four, check. Hailing frequency five, will someone please check me?" At the helm, sweat-soaked SULU (Lt. Comdr stripes) has a service plate open, is peering inside to make delicate adjust- ments, AD LIBBING "... Helm, now give me a reading on four point zero zero six of full." And at the Weapons Control, CHEKOV (Full Lt.)argues with TECHNICIANS who insist photon torpedoes read "ready" while Chekov argues the computer is not relaying that information.
34) 7) dialog: He's in Engineering, sir... (uncomfortable, indicates Captain's  chair) He doesn't know.
34) 11) dialog: I wouldn't have wanted to have been standing in his way. He wanted her back; he got her!
40) 2) dialog: Dock signals clear, Captain.
40) 34) dialog: (startled) Sir...? (then understands) Yes, of course... (to Ilia) Your pre-programming is already set in, Lieutenant.
40) 35) text: Sulu has almost tripped getting out of his chair. He starts offering Ilia his hand, then thinks better of it, withdraws it abruptly, immediately busies himself punching out equations on her console... AD LIBS, "It's all on the computer. You'll have no problem..." Sulu is nervous, fluttery around this lovely creature -- now hits a wrong switch. Produces a BEEPING SOUND which he fumbles to shut off. She smiles; speaks quietly, repeats:
40) 37) text: Sulu catches her eye but before he can reply, Decker has moved in beside Ilia.
43) 2) dialog: Helm ready, sir.
43) 6) dialog: Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
43) 8) dialog: (working controls) Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
53) 4) dialog: Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
53) 5) text: Sulu moves his controls forward -- everyone waits tensely -- and then we HEAR THE INCREASING THROB OF THE ACCELERATING ENGINES.
53) 6) dialog: (continuing) Warp point seven... point eight ... nine...
55) 1) dialog: Warp One, sir.
57) 1) dialog: Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
59) 3) dialog: Helm control restored, sir.
61) 8) text: gazing worriedly at the just-closed elevator doors, as Sulu is punching figures into his console.
61) 9) dialog: Maintaining warp point  eight; I show our new heading  as 287 point three Mark 105.
61) 11) dialog: (continuing; gently reminding) Lieutenant Ilia...?
71) 0) text: Sulu at the helm, accelerating; just a touch of tense- ness in crew as they move toward the speed which earlier threw them into the "wormhole" effect.
71) 2) text: Stars accelerating as Sulu calls off: 
71) 3) dialog: Warp point eight... point nine...
71) 5) dialog: (continuing) Warp one, sir.
71) 7) dialog: (continuing) Warp two, sir... warp three...
73) 4) text: Sulu hits a control -- viewer seems to ZOOM AHEAD and in the distance we SEE a point of light which grows into the LUMINESCENT CLOUD. The same as seen by the Klingons and Starfleet's Epsilon Nine station. Myster- ious, beautiful, and menacing.
73) 19) dialog: (in disbelief) -- twelve power?!
73) 40) dialog: Commencing evasive maneuvers... !
79) 1) dialog: The new screens held...!
81) 1) dialog: Here it comes...!
84) 18) text: All have reacted to this; Kirk exchanges a look with Spock who nods firmly. Then Kirk sees that both Decker and Sulu are throwing him a questioning look. In b.g. McCoy and Chapel have EXITED bridge with Chekov.
84) 43) dialog: Aye, sir.
88) 4) dialog: Sulu peering toward O.S. main viewer, his eyes wide with incredulity.
88) 19) dialog: (turning; concerned) We're closing in on it rapidly, Captain.
90) 2) dialog: (uneasy) We're already two settings below that, sir.
92) 1) dialog: One hundred kilometers...
101) 1) dialog: Reverse angle on the viewer, Captain.
101) 8) dialog: Viewer ahead, sir.
101) 12) dialog: (manipulating controls) Thrusters ahead, one third.
103) 1) dialog: (of Viewer) Something ahead, sir; looks like another area... (reacts) It's closing up...!
103) 2) text: Sulu is indicating what appears to be a lace-bulwark of POWERFIELD PATTERNS closing off the "chamber" in the distance ahead. Kirk, from the Science Station calls out:
103) 4) dialog: (manipulating controls) Thrusters at station keeping...
113) 2) dialog: Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
119) 2) text: Sulu hits the viewer magnification control.
119) 6) dialog: Your phaser, Captain...! Use your phaser...!
119) 9) dialog: Mr. Spock, the Captain is in trouble, directly behind you -- three hundred meters! (beat) Mr. Spock!
127) 28) text: Immediately, Sulu's voice:
128) 22) text: Sulu adjusts the viewer through several IMAGE MAGNI- FICATIONS until we SEE the huge OMINOUS GREEN DEVICES more clearly.
128) 23) dialog: The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...
128) 69) dialog: Clear the bridge, Captain...?
136) 5) dialog: Tractor beam remains constant...
138) 2) dialog: Forward motion slowing, Captain...!
140) 13) dialog: Forward motion stopped, Captain.
142) 18) text: Kirk studies Decker a beat -- there is something com- pelling about Decker's manner -- a certain sense of absolute necessity. Kirk seems about to deny the re- quest, then turns to Sulu:
143) 0) text: Uhura with Sulu and Chekov there.
