6) 19) dialog: Huh.
6) 23) dialog: You ever seen someone's foot be evil, Mr. Trout?
6) 27) dialog: My foot had a pretty nasty bunion once. I wouldn't say the foot itself was evil.
6) 31) dialog: Wrinkly ol' bunion looked like my grandmum. Had to saw her off. The bunion, not my grandmum.
6) 42) dialog: Come on, ya squirmy monster. Your days of evil-doin' are over.
6) 50) dialog: They must, right? Why else would they hide from us. We are the good guys.

27) 36) dialog: Over there Mr. Trout!
34) 109) dialog: You ever wonder what they're thinkin' `bout, Mr. Trout?
34) 115) dialog: Ah. Wonderin' why they chose to be evil, disgusting monsters instead of good guys like us!
34) 125) dialog: Best chums?
34) 140) dialog: That's why your name is the boss, boss!
34) 147) dialog: Shoes?
34) 158) dialog: Oh dear.
37) 6) dialog: Are you sure about this, boss? You know what cheese can do to you...

37) 55) dialog: 
39) 7) dialog: 
39) 20) dialog: You're not wrong, boss.

39) 53) dialog: Use your breathing.
39) 64) dialog: Tell us more about when you'll be king.
39) 72) dialog: Now, now Boss, you be careful up there.
39) 92) dialog: And it's growing back.

39) 282) dialog: Stop moving!
39) 285) dialog: Thank you.
39) 295) dialog: Oops.
41) 14) dialog: Don't make no sense. That's evil prevailing over good.
41) 25) dialog: I think we're all saying the same thing here.
41) 33) dialog: But, just in different ways.
54) 16) dialog: 
54) 76) dialog: Never seen one do that before!
54) 81) dialog: Goodness always triumphs over evil... right Mr. Trout? (Trout walks away) Mr. Trout?
54) 84) dialog: 
58) 92) dialog: (whispers to Trout) I thought this was all gonna be a show, like with Frou Frou. (pulls out fake mustache) I brought my mustache and everything.
58) 140) dialog: We're just doing our jobs.
58) 144) dialog: (long, hurt gasp) I knew that's how people saw us.
58) 151) dialog: A second chapter!
58) 174) dialog: Redeemed!
59) 161) dialog: So this is what all the fuss is about?
59) 164) dialog: What do you think, Mr. Trout?
59) 167) dialog: `Ere you have a go.
59) 179) dialog: Is this what you wanted, boss?
59) 258) dialog: Pull!
59) 318) dialog: 
61) 99) dialog: Yeah... all happy `n tidy.
61) 108) dialog: Not sure what we'd do next, though.
62) 3) dialog: Hmm.
62) 7) dialog: Free from evil.
62) 13) dialog: Ya ever think about the universe, Mr. Trout?
62) 17) dialog: What if our world is just like a tiny speck...
62) 21) dialog: And there are giants looking down on us?
62) 25) dialog: It's actually them moving us.
62) 32) dialog: Like that, just there, me blinking. That would've taken them a day.
62) 37) dialog: I mean, none of them are going home. They're having to do this bit. And now this bit. And this bit. I mean, this should stop.
62) 45) dialog: It's too much. And then they'd have had to've done me talking about the blink. And it never ends. I think they make a meal of it, to be honest. I don't know how they get the time. They've got to have other jobs. It's more like a hobby. Y'know, like stamp collecting, something you do in your free time.
