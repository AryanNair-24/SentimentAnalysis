8) 16) dialog: Don't.
8) 18) dialog: Each of these people is a piece of evidence. And we don't touch evidence. Doug resumes his surveillance. Pryzwarra watches him.
8) 20) dialog: It's not our job to care about these people. It's our job to catch the one who did this. The sudden muffled sound of a CELL PHONE. Both men turn - They're standing near a LINE OF BODIES laid out by paramedics. The cell phone RINGS AGAIN, inside one of the body bags. Never to be answered. Doug stares at it. Then he turns away, back toward his ca Pryzwarra stares at the body bag, cell phone still RINGIN

An imposing man, he reads loose pages, tough words coming from a gentle face -- McCREADY At approximately 10:50 this morning, the passenger ferry Sea Bride exploded in the waters of Long Island Sound, seven miles southwest of New London, Connecticut. Early estimates place the number of casualties at eight hundred and forty-three men, women and children. Shock and anger from those present. Doug enters at the ba unnoticed and unimportant. Standing room only, he looks o the shoulders of two taller agents to see -- McCREADY Men, ladies -- this happened on July Fourth. The Sea Bride was carrying servicemen and their families to a special event at Groton Sub Base. We consider this a deliberate act of terrorism against the United States Navy. The President concurs with our assessment. McCready shuffles to a new piece of paper -—- McCREADY Uh, I'm also told that someone claiming to be a Federal Agent stole an ambulance out of Brookhaven Medical last night. So whoever took it, just leave the keys on my desk, and there'll be no questions asked. Polite laughter from the room. Nice try, boss. McCREADY Folks, this is a perfect act of terrorism. There were no baggage checks, no flight data recorders, maximum casualties, and all the evidence is under 90 feet of seawater. Don't overlook anything.

Tell me. That ritual observed, he gently pulls the sheet away -- -- revealing the CHARRED BLUE BODY of a young WOMAN, wear what used to be a pretty summer dress. She stares up at u cold, angelic, dead. Doug stares at her, standing a few feet back. The M.E. gestures him closer, as if to say, 'come take a look.' Doug moves to the woman's side -- suddenly she turns to l straight into his eyes. The M.E. has rolled her head to o side. 11.
12) 7) dialog: Do you have a UV gun? M.E. Second shelf behind you. Doug goes to the shelf. Intrigued now, the M.E. moves to head of the table, turns off the overhead lamp. Doug brings a hand-held ULTRAVIOLET GUN to the table. Aim at the woman's face, pulls the trigger -- -- illuminating a WIDE BAND OF CHEMICAL RESIDUE across he mouth and cheeks, glowing like yellow neon. The shape is perfect rectangle.
12) 9) dialog: What's that stippling ... see that? He points: within the band of tape residue, numerous TRAC PARTICLES stand out under the light like tiny stars.

Doug picks up the Polaroid camera, centers it on the woma face. He hesitates, looks at her almost apologetically .. Then aims the camera again, holds it there. A FLASH --

On the coffee table in front of them rests the Polaroid p of their daughter, dead on an autopsy table. Doug picks up the photograph, waits quietly as Claire's parents try to cope.
14) 5) dialog: We don't know yet, sir. But anything you can tell me about your daughter's activities this weekend will help.

14) 15) dialog: We'll, ah ... we'll need a recent photo, and keys to her house if you have them. They don't hear him anymore, lost in naked grief. Doug wa profoundly uncomfortable. Finally:

15) 2) dialog: Doug, please. You can call me Doug.
16) 0) text: Still light out, but barely. Doug stares through the windshield out at a tree-lined street, a quaint one-story house. The driveway is empty. Doug pulls a pair of plastic gloves out of his pocket and gets out of his car, approaches the house. 16.

17) 1) dialog: Hello, Ginger. The cat steps forward ... then suddenly leaps up into Dou arms; he has no choice but to catch it. Doug is startled a moment, not sure what to do. Then shru steps inside, scratching the cat's head.

Rubs up against a particular cabinet. Using a gloved hand, Doug opens the cabinet. Cat food. Of course. He drops a handful of cat food into a dish for th starving cat. Turns to the refrigerator -- A CHILD'S CRAYON DRAWING is affixed to the door; we can m out the words 'JANICE HARRIS, Gr. 2' scrawled at the bott Next to it: a newspaper ad for a 'White FORD EXPLORER, lo miles, excellent condition.' Doug glances up -- the freezer door is littered with word from a magnetic poetry kit. In the middle, a sentence:

24) 9) dialog: I'm Agent Carlin, LIRA Evidence Recovery --
24) 12) dialog: This afternoon I witnessed the autopsy of a young woman who washed up off Plum Island, with heavy fuel burns and traces of thermite powder on her face. She‘d also lost several fingers in what appeared to be blast damage. McCready catches the slight inflection:
24) 14) dialog: When I checked the tide tables against the position of the blast ... sir, this woman was killed at least two hours before the ferry exploded.
24) 17) dialog: Her name is Claire Kuchever. Her body washed up before the explosion and against the tide. Doug has everyone's attention now. McCready is dubious, stares at him.
24) 19) dialog: I believe someone abducted her from her home, taped her mouth and wrists, then severed her fingers -- probably because she had his DNA under her nails. (MORE)
24) 20) text: DOUG (cont'd) Then he burned her alive and dumped her into the Sound, where she would appear to be just another disaster victim --
24) 23) dialog: I work Evidence Recovery as needed. My main field is victimology. I believe we're looking for a lone individual, most likely a paranoid sociopath. No group has claimed responsibility? Pryzwarra shakes his head 'no.'
24) 25) dialog: Her SUV is missing. It could have been stolen to drive the bomb onto the ferry. (checks his file) New York license CHB 4470. A white Ford Explorer. The agents look down at the pieces, then at each other -- yeah, that fits. Doug holds out his report to McCready.
24) 26) dialog: Something else ... The victim placed a call to the Long Island field office the night before she was killed. Denny's eyebrows go up at this. McCready takes the report
24) 28) dialog: Hey, where's Minuti?
24) 30) dialog: My partner, Larry Minuti. That's his car. Pryzwarra looks ... then closes his eyes in an ‘aw, fuck’ expression. Even McCready looks solemn.
25) 0) text: Doug leans on the driver's side window of his car, head d not moving. In the glass, the distorted reflection of an HELICOPTER moves past. Doug closes his eyes.

26) 2) dialog: For me to have questions, first I'd have to know something. Pryzwarra grins.
26) 4) dialog: Why me?
26) 6) dialog: That's what you told the people back there. Why me? Pryzwarra smiles, leans forward.

34) 8) dialog: Digital re-creation?
34) 12) dialog: You can't do that. You can't change the angle on video shot four days ago.
34) 16) dialog: You've developed a working time window. You can look into the past. From the looks of things its a prototype machine, developed on limited funds -- (slight smile) -- probably no more than ten billion. You're using it as an investigative tool, trying to find a clue to the identity of the ferry bomber. Denny and Pryzwarra are impressed.
34) 17) dialog: The only thing I don't understand is why you're looking at four days ago, and not yesterday when it happened.
34) 22) dialog: So -- three days from now -- you'll be able look back to -- yesterday. (realizes) You'll be able to see the explosion, see who did it. You'll see him as he does it.
34) 26) dialog: Claire's house.
36) 10) dialog: Rotate the view. I want to see what she's looking at. IN THE TIME WINDOW: The view moves to reveal -- a MIRROR the wall. Claire is looking at her own reflection, practi her smile and greeting, not happy with any of them:
36) 13) dialog: We held hands once. But no, I've never met her. Gunnars frowns at that. A thought hits Doug, and he pulls his cell phone. Hits a button --
37) 2) dialog: (filtered) This is Doug Carlin. Where are you?
37) 4) dialog: Right. What room are you in?
37) 6) dialog: (filtered) What do you mean?
38) 0) text: Doug frowns at that. He stares up at the screen, into the bedroom, where Claire picks out another blouse, slips it
38) 1) dialog: Describe what you see. Just humor me, okay? 34.
38) 3) dialog: Is anyone there?
38) 5) dialog: Uh ... okay. Great, thanks. Doug closes the phone, looks over -- Denny has been watch him, amused.
38) 7) dialog: Can you blame me?
39) 6) dialog: I want her appointment book brought here ... also any notes, diaries, checkbook, photos, any record of any kind. I want to know everything there is to know about her.
39) 8) dialog: It's likely our man scoped out the ferry, yes. But we don't know when, or what he looks like. We could look right at him and not know. (back to the screen) But we'll notice a change, even a small change, in this woman's life. some looks where Doug looks -- staring at Claire, who at the table, reading. Pryzwarra shrugs.
40) 0) text: Items from Claire's life are spread out around Doug. Purs photographs in a shoebox, journals, checkbook, a box of drawings, letters, etc. Doug has Claire's notebook computer in front of him. He clicks on a photo: Ginger, her cat, grabbing onto the cou Claire has added that timeless caption 'Hang in there, Doug smiles, glances up -- appointment book, bank statements, Baby!' 36. IN THE TIME WINDOW, Claire dabs off her makeup. Turns on shower, checks the water. She steps out of her skirt. IN THE LAB, some embarrassment among the observers.
40) 3) dialog: We'll do what any normal, average house guest would do ... (smiles) Let's check out her medicine cabinet. He nods to Gunnars, who (somewhat reluctantly) moves the Window view away from Claire, toward the mirrored medicin cabinet. A brief, out-of-focus glimpse of Claire's nude f in the reflection -- -- and then the view MOVES PAST the mirror, into the cabi There is just enough light coming in around the edges to there's not much there.
40) 5) dialog: What's on the other side of the wall?
40) 7) dialog: Let's check it out. IN THE TIME WINDOW, the view pushes THROUGH THE WALL into kitchen. The view does a slow 360 scan. Doug frowns --
40) 8) dialog: Huh. No tomato timer. 37.
40) 10) dialog: I noticed it when I was in the house before. This funky little ... food timer, in the shape of a tomato. Next to the microwave. It's not there.
40) 16) dialog: Follow her. IN THE TIME WINDOW, Claire enters her bedroom, lays down on the bed. Opens up her journal, starts to write. IN THE LAB, Doug searches, finds, opens up the same journ He flips through pages -- IN THE TIME WINDOW, the view shifts to over Claire's shoulder, looking down at the page as she writes -—- ‘Nothing much special today. Got that weird I'm-being-wat feeling again, but I'm sure it's nothing. Need to install lights outside the house. Trade the cat in on a German Shepherd. I feel like a goldfish. It's like someone's out there.' CLOSE ON: the same journal page. Doug watches her write w she's already written. Weird. 38.
40) 19) dialog: Not true. We are. IN THE TIME WINDOW, the view peers in through the Window, then moves through, centered on Claire. She's set the journal aside, turned the light off. Laying her side, she stares out at the dark. Eyes open, but no w to tell what her thoughts might be. Doug watches her ... Claire's eyes close and her features relax. Her expressio pure, no one around, no one to see. Simple, unaffected, n artifice, no agenda. Naked and vulnerable. Doug's expression softens as well ... lost in her feature in the beauty of her peaceful expression ...
41) 2) dialog: (low) The ex didn't show. 39.

42) 0) text: IN A GROCERY STORE, Claire stops her half-full shopping c in front of the cake mix shelf, looking pensive, sullen. Other shoppers move past, not noticing anything. Claire i alone in the store, lost in some private moment. IN THE LAB, Doug frowns. He has Claire's journal open in front of him -- ON THE JOURNAL PAGE, in Claire's hand: 'Went shopping tod shopping for one, made me feel alone -- I hate when that happens.' 41. Gunnars looks closely at Claire.
42) 6) dialog: That's him.
42) 16) dialog: He's waiting ... he wants to steal the car as late in the game as he can, so there's no time to track it --
42) 20) dialog: He's thinking ... a date means someone who's expecting her, who would miss her. Which could ruin his plans ...
42) 27) dialog: Wait -- we got surveillance video on that one, didn’t we?
43) 0) text: Doug, Pryzwarra, the other agents gather before a MONITOR that displays TIME-CODED SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.
43) 2) dialog: Scan ahead to exactly the time of the phone call.
43) 9) dialog: What‘s that on the ground? Doug points. ON SCREEN, at the base of the phone booth: a dark blob with a blurry white logo.
43) 11) dialog: You have access to face-recognition software, right?
43) 13) dialog: Use it on the bag. How many hours of video have been logged?
43) 16) dialog: Same guy. What is this?
43) 19) dialog: And seven hours from now. IN THE WINDOW, Claire sits at her desk, working on an illustration. She erases a small error. Glances down, whe Janice sits on the floor, drawing with magic markers. IN THE MAIN LAB, Doug watches the scene. Glances around a the others -- Pryzwarra confers with Stalhuth and Denny. 46.
43) 38) dialog: When were you gonna tell me? Silence. They all look up at him.
43) 39) dialog: This thing's not just a window, is it? The team members look to Pryzwarra.
43) 41) dialog: She saw it, Andy! I aimed a light at her JUST NOW, and she reacted to it
43) 43) dialog: We can send things back, can't we?
43) 45) dialog: We could GO back! 48.
43) 49) dialog: Why not?
43) 51) dialog: You've tried? Denny and Pryzwarra exchange a look.
43) 54) dialog: What about a warning? A radio signal --
43) 57) dialog: (exasperated) Then what about a note? They all look at each other.
43) 58) dialog: A note. A single piece of paper, one sheet. Again the team looks to Pryzwarra -- 49.
43) 61) dialog: But it is possible?
43) 68) dialog: We could stop this, Andy! We could save all those people -—-
43) 70) dialog: Then we'll have to send a warning that gets him apprehended and put away for good, prior to the first explosion.
43) 73) dialog: We send it back to ourselves. To me, at the Bureau. An anonymous tip that someone is planning to bomb the Orient Point ferry on July 4th. (thinking it through) (MORE )
43) 74) text: DOUG (cont'd) We know the suspect was at the dock with a camcorder the night before. Instant search warrant -- they find the bomb -- we could have him in custody before he even meets Claire --
43) 81) dialog: What if there's more to it than physics?
43) 83) dialog: Maybe. But I've spent my entire career chasing people after they've done something horrible. (MORE )
43) 84) text: DOUG (cont'd) For once, I'd like to stop someone from ever hurting anybody in the first place. Can you understand that? Doug looks over, sees that Pryzwarra has been listening. They exchange a look.
47) 0) text: Pryzwarra writes out the warning while Doug dictates:
47) 1) dialog: You know, this would go faster if I did it myself --
47) 3) dialog: "Terror suspect will be at Orient Point dock, 4:40am ...
47) 5) dialog: It'll hold up. Just don't leave any prints on the note. Pryzwarra looks at his fingers, glares at Doug -- 'now he tells me.' He crumples the note and starts over.
47) 7) dialog: There was, ah ... there was a reporter I worked with a few years back. The way we're phrasing this, I'm pretty sure I'll think it's from him.
47) 12) dialog: I did not believe him, I wanted to prove that he was wrong.
47) 14) dialog: I took a seat cushion from the forward cabin, to run independent tests on the fabric for missile residue. (beat) Yeah, I stole evidence.
47) 16) dialog: The Bureau arrested Campbell and confiscated the samples before we could finish the tests.
47) 18) dialog: Read the file. Shanti approaches:
48) 0) text: Every screen is active, every station manned. Doug, Pryzwarra, Denny and his team are all at their places. Suspended before the Time Window, held by a thin glass armature: the warning note.
48) 6) dialog: To us? (Pryzwarra nods) I imagine we'll all instantly pop into some other part of our lives with no memory that any of this ever happened «se. and you and I would never meet. Pryzwarra ponders that for a moment. Then:
48) 9) dialog: Go to the third floor, southwest corner -- The VIEW RISES THROUGH ANOTHER FLOOR and into the main of pen -- the same open area of desks where Doug took the fi call about Claire --
48) 10) dialog: That's it, stop-stop-stop. Right here ... now pan over to the right by the wall ... The office is nearly deserted, many of the desks unoccupi as the VIEW PANS ACROSS them, but two voices can be heard
48) 12) dialog: I don't play games, Larry. IN THE LAB, Doug's face goes slack as he watches the scre IN THE WINDOW, is -- HIMSELF. Four days ago, Doug is having a barely-contained argument with his partner, LARRY MINUTI.
48) 14) dialog: I told you, it was just a hunch --
48) 18) dialog: Yeah. That's Larry. My partner. (he watches) Jesus, I'd forgotten about this. Denny shoots a glance to Doug at that. Checks his monitor
48) 20) dialog: Mine? Yeah.
48) 22) dialog: I'm tired of having to explain myself every time I manage to do the job ...
48) 29) dialog: Look, I told you before -- and I'm telling you now -- I don't go outside proper channels anymore. If I peg a guy on a hunch, that's police work, not some conspiracy to keep you out of the loop.
48) 31) dialog: (to Denny) We'd better hurry! If memory serves, I storm outta there in about a minute.
48) 34) dialog: I don't have time for this. You do what you have to do, Larry. And have a nice vacation. DOUG. (watching himself) No ... IN THE WINDOW, Doug marches away -- from his desk, his partner, and the note. A collective sigh of futility. 57.
48) 36) dialog: Whoa!
48) 40) dialog: We don't know if it's fantastic yet, everybody quiet! They watch as MINUTI reads the note. He frowns, looks off to where Doug has just left, slamming a door.
48) 41) dialog: Come on, Larry ... Minuti checks his watch, looks at the note again. The tea watches, breathless. Then Minuti comes to a decision: he folds the note and gr his jacket, heading out.
48) 45) dialog: Because he thinks that's where I'm going. He thinks I went without backup. (a look) "Lone wolf shit." ON SCREEN, Minuti passes Exit 30, eastbound on the L.I.E. CRACKLE OF STATIC comes from the screen:
48) 46) dialog: What's happening ... The image of Minuti on the road FILLS WITH STATIC.
48) 53) dialog: Where is he ...? Doug checks his laptop: A FREEZE FRAME of the security ca video. The timecode reads 04:40:37AM. 59.
48) 55) dialog: Maybe he didn't park in the lot. (to Gunnars) Bring it around in a circle. The WINDOW VIEW pans across the side of the lot, past lightposts, trees, hedges --
48) 56) dialog: Hold it! Right there. Move in... The VIEW NARROWS until they all see it -- a man in a dark sweatsuit, climbing through one of the hedges.
48) 58) dialog: I wanna see his face. IN THE WINDOW, the man has a camera bag over one shoulder he steps onto the dock, the light reaches his face -- Doug goes dead pale.
48) 59) dialog: He was at Claire's funeral! The groundskeeper! The man -- his name is CARROLL OERSTADT -- lifts a camcor to his eye and begins taping, scoping the facility.
48) 61) dialog: (to Gunnars) Pull back. Show me the back of the hedge, but don't lose the suspect. The Window retreats to a WIDE DOWN ANGLE, revealing the b of the hedge -- where a red JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE is parked
48) 62) dialog: Move in on the license plate -- Suddenly another car drives past --
48) 64) dialog: Wait, follow Minuti!
48) 66) dialog: There is no plate, follow him -- THE WINDOW follows Minuti's car into the dock parking lot Doug looks up at the clock: 4:39AM and counting --
48) 67) dialog: No wait, back over to the dock, hurry! THE WINDOW PANS OVER to Oerstadt, who is still taping the ferry as Minuti pulls into the lot. The wash of Minuti's HEADLIGHTS passes over him -- -- exactly as they did in the security video, startling h exactly as they did before, causing him to step back out view exactly the same way --
48) 68) dialog: (yelling at Gunnars) Move it over, stay with him! THE WINDOW catches up with Oerstadt as Minuti's car sudde cuts him off from the hedge --
48) 87) dialog: Larry!
48) 90) dialog: No, no, no --! Minuti falls face-first to the ground. Oerstadt hauls his body off the blacktop, drags him back through the hedge - THE WINDOW FOLLOWS to Oerstadt's SUV -- which now has a t bullet hole in the back window, so does the side window, apparent exit wound -- Oerstadt dumps Minuti's body into the back of the Cheroke and slams it shut, runs to the driver's side -- 62.
48) 94) dialog: Goggles!
48) 96) dialog: Keep the phones clear, stay with him!
