Early estimates place the number of casualties at eight hundred and forty-three men, women and children. Shock and anger from those present. Doug enters at the ba unnoticed and unimportant. Standing room only, he looks o the shoulders of two taller agents to see -- McCREADY Men, ladies -- this happened on July Fourth. The Sea Bride was carrying servicemen and their families to a special event at Groton Sub Base. We consider this a deliberate act of terrorism against the United States Navy.

McCready shuffles to a new piece of paper -—- McCREADY Uh, I'm also told that someone claiming to be a Federal Agent stole an ambulance out of Brookhaven Medical last night.

He hits the 'Door Open' button -- nothing. Looks up, sees security camera --— POV: SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE, BLACK & WHITE, looking down Oerstadt. He smiles ruefully, nods his head, resigned.
