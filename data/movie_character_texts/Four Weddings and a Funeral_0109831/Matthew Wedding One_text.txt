SCARLETT and he both get out and walk swiftly SCARLETT is dressed all in black, except for pink shoes.
7) 111) dialog: Not at all - Gareth would have been deeply wounded if you'd broken a lifetime's tradition.
7) 115) dialog: Gareth used to prefer funerals to weddings. He said it was easier to get enthusiastic about a ceremony one at least had an outside chance of eventually being involved in. Everyone laughs, they are immediately at ease. CHARLES discreetly signs MATTHEW'S words for DAVID. In order to do my research for this speech I rang round to get a general picture of how Gareth was regarded by those who met him. "Fat" seems to be a word people most connected with him. I rang a couple of libraries and asked if they remembered him. "No." - "He was fat..." - "O yes, of course!". "Terribly rude" also rang a lot of bells. When I told the emotional Italian in our local sandwich shop that Gareth was dead, his first reaction was "Thank God for that" — before, of course, bursting into tears and closing the shop to mourn. So, "very rude and very fat" seems to have been the stranger's viewpoint. And I'm sure the maker of his waistcoats would like me to add "very demanding and, of course, quite mad". On the other hand, some of you have been kind enough to ring me, and
7) 117) text: 95 MATTHEW (cont'd) tell me that you loved him - which I know he would have been thrilled to hear. Your remember his fabulous hospitality and his strange, experimental cooking - the recipe for Duck a la Banana fortunately goes with him to his grave. Most of all, you tell me of his enormous capacity for joy, and when joyful, for highly vocal drunkenness. His full bass version of "Shaddupa Ya Face" is something we will all, tragically, never forget. But I hope joyful is how you will remember hin. Not stuck in a box in a church. Pick your favourite of his waistcoats and then remember him that way: the most splendid, replete, gaudily dressed, weak- hearted as it turned out, and jolly bugger most of us ever met. As for me, you may ask how I will remember him, what I thought of hin, and, ‘unfortunately, there I fall rather short of words. Perhaps you'll forgive me if I turn for ny own feelings to the words of another splendid bugger, W.H.Auden... He recites a poem by Auden. At first he modestly reads it and then looks up and speaks it, not consulting the paper in front of him. Cut aways during the poem should include GARETH'S parents - it would be nice to feel they understa MATTHEW. This is actually what I want to say: "Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone. Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone. Silence the pianos and with muffled drum Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come. Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead Scribbling on the sky the message He is Dead, Put the crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves, Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves. He was my North, my South, my East and West My working week and my Sunday rest My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song, I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong. The stars are not wanted now: put out every one
7) 118) text: 96 MATTHEW (cont 'd) Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood For nothing now can ever come to any good". A long silence as MATTHEW folds his piece of paper. As he goes and sits down, a little child cries out, fed up.

7) 171) dialog: We were just about to have a toast. Ladies and gentlemen - the Groom. And they all turn towards CHARLES: all with beaming smile
7) 177) dialog: Only a few hours from now, I'm going to be standing up and making a speech about what a wonderful day this is for this unbe-fucking- lievably perfect couple.
7) 179) dialog: But here, amongst friends, I'm sure we'd all agree that it's time for a little more honesty.
7) 181) dialog: I for one had totally given up on Charles getting married. I thought - the only way for him ever tying the knot would be to team up with some equally desperate ex, and make the best of a bad job.
7) 183) dialog: Either that - or he'd marry someone for their looks and accept the fact that he's basically married to us lot - the only problem being we refuse to have his babies.
7) 186) dialog: And the truth of the matter is - he's gone and done both - settled for some desperately attractive desperate ex.
