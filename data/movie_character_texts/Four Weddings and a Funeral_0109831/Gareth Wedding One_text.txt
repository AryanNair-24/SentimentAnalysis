This is the room they have moved Gareth to. It is huge an empty. There is a sharp contrast between the two rooms - one absolutely packed and full of laughter, the other still, with six small figures alone in a big space. We se GARETH's fabulous waistcoat being unbuttoned. FIONA, DAVID, CHARLES, TOM are there.
7) 117) text: 95 MATTHEW (cont'd) tell me that you loved him - which I know he would have been thrilled to hear. Your remember his fabulous hospitality and his strange, experimental cooking - the recipe for Duck a la Banana fortunately goes with him to his grave. Most of all, you tell me of his enormous capacity for joy, and when joyful, for highly vocal drunkenness. His full bass version of "Shaddupa Ya Face" is something we will all, tragically, never forget. But I hope joyful is how you will remember hin. Not stuck in a box in a church. Pick your favourite of his waistcoats and then remember him that way: the most splendid, replete, gaudily dressed, weak- hearted as it turned out, and jolly bugger most of us ever met. As for me, you may ask how I will remember him, what I thought of hin, and, ‘unfortunately, there I fall rather short of words. Perhaps you'll forgive me if I turn for ny own feelings to the words of another splendid bugger, W.H.Auden... He recites a poem by Auden. At first he modestly reads it and then looks up and speaks it, not consulting the paper in front of him. Cut aways during the poem should include GARETH'S parents - it would be nice to feel they understa MATTHEW. This is actually what I want to say: "Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone. Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone. Silence the pianos and with muffled drum Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come. Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead Scribbling on the sky the message He is Dead, Put the crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves, Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves. He was my North, my South, my East and West My working week and my Sunday rest My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song, I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong. The stars are not wanted now: put out every one
