2) 121) dialog: Hello John - this is...sorry, I don't know your...
2) 125) dialog: O dear - still, don't be too gloomy - rumour has it she never stopped shagging old Toby de Lisle, just in case you didn't work out.
2) 127) dialog: Excelient. Excellent.
2) 130) dialog: Ahm...any children or anything? CARRIE moves away - she helps herself to a drink. She loo around and there in the corner, sees CHARLES deliberately his head against the wall, once.

Before I start my speech, can I just say this - I am, as ever, in bewildered awe of any couple who make the commitment that Angus and Laura have made this morning. True love is a very rare and splendid thing - and I think we see it here today. ANGUS and LAURA are touched. This is only the second time I've ever been a best man. I hope I did the job all right that time - the couple in question at least are still talking to me. Unfortunately, they're not talking to each other - the divorce came through a couple of months ago.

2) 183) dialog: Try Tom.
2) 185) dialog: Damn.

GARETH is now doing the bump with a hefty grandmother. Bump! CHARLES (cont) Though, let's say one did take a fancy to someone at a wedding: do you think there really are people who can just go up and say - "Hi - I'm Charles - this’ is your lucky night"?
2) 192) dialog: Quite - 3 weeks is about my question-popping mininun. 23
2) 208) dialog: Scarlett and I are at some pub - The Lucky Boat or something. Aren't we all?
2) 210) dialog: Well, no, that sounds lovely - is there room for Scarlett too?
2) 212) dialog: Tom - are you the richest man in England? 25 TOM . Oh - no, no. I believe we're about 7th. The Queen obviously, and that Branson bloke is doing terribly well. Well, excellent news - I'll go tell Scarlett. As TOM walks away

2) 219) dialog: That's right. But now I'm going to stay at some friend's house...with some friends. Well, I say 'house' —- I think 'enormous castle' is a more accurate description.
2) 221) dialog: oO. PAUSE. She doesn't give CHARLES quite enough time to recover. It's quite a direct invitation.
2) 225) dialog: O,no, you mustn't - we could meet now ~ the evening's just getting going. They survey the fallen-bottle, toppled-chair mess.

3) 6) text: 28 32. EXT. CAR. COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT. 32. CHARLES is standing in the middle of the road, in the mid of the night in the middle of nowhere. As the car drives away - they start to shout the chorus o ‘Without You'.
3) 8) dialog: Right. Odd decision. He heads back along the road. 33. EXT. TOWN UARE. NIGHT. 33. A charming town square. The Boatman is a pleasant, large hotel, white, with an archway through which cars can driv park at the back. The name of the Hotel is on big carved letters outside. CHARLES enters. The sign shows the lucky boatman getting a blowjob from a mermaid, while his friends are being eaten -by sharks. 34. INT. RECEPTION. ATMAN. NIGHT 34. It is now about one in the morning. Very quiet.

3) 32) dialog: Yes. CARRIE appears behind GEORGE, crawling towards the door.
3) 35) dialog: University. He sees CARRIE now talking to the WAITER outside the room
3) 38) dialog: Good point. Shakespeare's short stories equally pointless. WAITER re-enters formally.
3) 40) dialog: My wife?

3) 55) dialog: Yes - perhaps we could skulk around here and then go back down.
3) 57) dialog: No, I don't normally think of myself as a skulker.
3) 60) dialog: No - it doesn't always happen. "You may now kiss the bride" isn't actually in the Book of Common Prayer.
3) 62) dialog: How far do you think too far would be?
3) 64) dialog: oO yes - I think so. In fact, it might be thought a little...dismissive... 32 36. 33
3) 66) dialog: Yes. You wouldn't want to take it any further. I mean...(a long kiss) That might be taking it a little far. And... This becomes a voice over, as we pan across her bedroom.
3) 67) dialog: ....what about this - do you think the vicar would think things had slipped a little out of his control? They are naked and making love on the bed.
3) 69) dialog: I'm sure we are.
3) 71) dialog: I'm not sure - I suppose '‘honey' because it's as sweet as honey - and ‘moon' because it was the first time a husband saw his wife's bottom. She laughs - for all his early unsureness, she makes hin relaxed, by being so totally relaxed herself. 37. EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY. 37. The beautiful landscape outside waking up in the dawn, bi dew, a stream. 8. INT. ROOM 12. THE BOATMAN. DAY. 38. We see the edge of the bed, knee level, CARRIE's legs. He hand reaches down and picks up her dress. Then her shoes. move round to see CHARLES still fast asleep. He slowly wa opens his eyes and looks up. Again, her face is caught in beautiful light.
3) 72) dialog: What's happening?
3) 75) dialog: Where to?
3) 77) dialog: When are you going?
3) 79) dialog: That is a tragedy. He flops his head onto the pillow.
3) 81) dialog: What announcement?
3) 83) dialog: Whose engagement?
3) 85) dialog: Ah, gosh, look, this sort of thing takes a lot of thought, I obviously ahm... Then he suddenly sees she's smiling. She nods. CHARLES (cont) You're joking?

4) 12) dialog: F...Damn. He looks around, sees a spare place and moves swiftly int At last he has a moment of rest. Then, from beside him, a voice...
4) 16) dialog: Yes, I'm a big idiot. CHARLES settles himself and then looks back at CARRIE and smiles at her - he's going to enjoy her company.
4) 17) dialog: Do you live here now?
4) 19) dialog: Wonderful news. Up at the front, the young priest steps forward into posi to conduct the service. It is FATHER GERALD from the last reception. He looks a little tense.

4) 26) dialog: Oo. CHARLES looks around - all his friends have noticed the problem - they give a unison thumbs up to him - they're enjoying it.
4) 66) dialog: I thought you'd gone to America. We could've been married by now if you'd just rung me. She turns to the man beside her. He's 50 - older - silver haired - respectable, inaccessible.
4) 68) text: 43 CHARLES doesn't register a moment's hesitation or embarrassment, despite the fact that this is a bad moment hopes had risen high.
4) 69) dialog: Excellent - how do you do, Hamish - delighted to meet you. What a charming surprise to find Carrie back in the country.
4) 93) dialog: 
4) 98) dialog: (bit shaken) Yes. Excellent. That or cyanide. 50. iT. HOTEL. BA: IM. : oO. They move forward into the ballroom, and CHARLES glimpses CARRIE and HAMISH again. CHARLES (cont) I've got a bad feeling about this wedding.

4) 132) dialog: Yes, catering's always the problen. The worst one I went to, the sister had done it. Unbelievable - though at least one knew who to lie to.
4) 134) dialog: It just seems as though it's impossible to get it right. I mean look at this. Suppose it's meant to be asparagus - but it looks and tastes like a dead man's penis. Now, tell me, what do you do?
4) 136) dialog: Good Lord - so you know what I'm talking about. Do you ever do weddings?
4) 139) dialog: They should have asked you to do this one.
4) 141) dialog: God - I wish you hadn't turned it down.
4) 143) dialog: Excellent. Excellent. If you'll just excuse me a moment, I think this knife should be sharp enough for the de-testiculation process. As he moves away, he again is passed by CARRIE and HAMISH curt ON TO:
4) 145) dialog: O God. This must be a joke. CHARLES shakes his head - everything is going wrong for hin.

4) 239) dialog: O God -
4) 241) dialog: I did not!
4) 243) dialog: Did you?
4) 245) dialog: Well, sometimes, I admit - I mean, take that girl with the big knife.
4) 248) dialog: Hen, you know me - most of the time I don't think at all - I just potter along.
4) 251) dialog: Yes, it's a great night. Up there with my father's funeral for sheer .entertainment value.

5) 4) dialog: You're right. I've got very little to contribute on that one. Silently CHARLES dresses. CHARLES (cont) Would you like to go out sometime....
5) 6) dialog: Why?
5) 9) dialog: Good reason. You see, this is my whole argument against marriage - even when I'd found the right girl - I'd keep bumping into people like you. He hand comes up and waves him goodbye. He hesitates. and then turns to go. An alarm clock rings.
5) 15) dialog: Thanks. CHARLES takes a big, white envelope and tears it open. It is a formal invitation.
5) 16) dialog: oO no. I can't go to any more weddings - they last too long and ny waistcoat doesn't fit. (He reads it): "Mr and Mrs Gregory Hartnell the Third invite you to the wedding of their daughter Judith Caroline to Sir Hamish Banks" (He is mystified) Who are these people? SCARLETT takes the invite and inspects.
5) 18) dialog: It's a novel idea isn't it - sending wedding invites to people you don't know. "Dear Greg, Thanks very much for your totally charming invitation. Unfortunately, I've never fucking heard of you or your daughter Judith, so I fear I shan't be attending". Christ - what a cheek - they've even put in a wedding list!
5) 22) dialog: Yes - but this one's called Judith.
5) 24) dialog: Good Lord. I think you're right. Dammit. Why didn't I marry her? Can you remember? SCARLETT . Because you only met her twice, and you rather threw away the chance of a deep and meaningful relationship by banging her on both occasions.

5) 93) dialog: That's a sickeningly wholesome story - what did your Dad do when it was sunny?
5) 95) dialog: One really strange thing is thinking you'll never sleep with anyone else. You don't think you'll ever be unfaithful?
5) 97) dialog: Quite right. Although just before he died John Betjeman was asked if he had any regrets in life and he said he wished he'd slept around more.

5) 139) dialog: Sorry - Sorry. (Pause) I wish I'd rung you. (She smiles) But then you didn't ring me _ either. You ruthlessly slept with me twice, and then never rang me.

7) 35) dialog: No. I think I'll just sit here and wait for my wife to find me. DAVID raises an eyebrow and walks away - CHARLES sits dow on his own near a large stuffed warrior. A voice comes from behind him...
7) 37) dialog: 0, Hen, no please - I couldn't bear a scene today. I know I'm a total shite, I deserve repeated torture...
7) 39) dialog: Do you remember when we were on holiday in the Caribbean and I got attacked by that enormous stingray...?
7) 41) dialog: It was worse. She laughs. She is in a good playful mood - you can now see why they might have once gone out - they are comfortable as old boyfriend and girlfriend.
7) 42) dialog: Christ, I'm depressed ~ how are you?
7) 44) dialog: Yes, you look wonderful... Perhaps you were right, Hen - perhaps we should have got married.

7) 199) dialog: As you know, the passage to the altar has not been the most peaceful for me and Hen - but in the end, for all my imperfections, she took me with no conditions at all apart from the fact that I shouldn't be late to the service - so I reckon it's a pretty good deal.
