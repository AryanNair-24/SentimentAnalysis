41) 63) dialog: Anyway... I don't know what the  church's position is on adultery and  fornication these days, but I felt  really hypocritical not saying  anything to you about it before,  so... What is the official position  on that stuff these days?
41) 65) dialog: Good: I think it should be.
41) 67) dialog: Why not?
41) 69) dialog: I think you should.
41) 71) dialog: Maybe it was better when you came in  and they screamed at you for having  sex with your married boss, and were  really mean to you, and told you  what a terrible thing it was. Maybe  it'd be better if you told me how  I'm endangering my immortal soul,  and if I don't quit I'm going to  burn in hell. Don't you ever think  that?
41) 73) dialog: Well, it's a lot better than all  this "Why do you think you're in  this situation" psychological bullshit  you hear all the time.
41) 75) dialog: With which one?
41) 78) dialog: I feel sorry for them. (Pause) Isn't that ridiculous?
42) 22) dialog: No. I'm not gonna stay long. Bob, I  don't want to get married.
42) 25) dialog: I've really thought about it a lot,  and if you had asked me last year  I'm sure I would have said yes.
42) 27) dialog: But I'm not sure it would have been  a good idea then either. I'm going  through a really hard time right now  and I just think that getting engaged  to you or anyone would be just about  the stupidest most self-destructive  thing I could possibly do.
42) 29) dialog: And I really think you have to grow  up.
42) 31) dialog: OK. (Pause) I really hope we can still be friends.
42) 34) dialog: Bob... This is so crazy... I mean...  I don't even understand why you... I  don't even get it.

42) 51) dialog: Sorry I'm so late.
42) 53) dialog: Well -- maybe it would've been better  if you had...
42) 55) dialog: I mean -- Look, I don't mean to be  unsympathetic about your domestic  situation, whatever it is, but I'm  just beginning to think that if people  tried a little harder to stick to  their commitments and started taking  a little responsibility for their  actions, they might end up having a  lot less trouble generally. That's  all.
42) 57) dialog: Well, I really don't think I can do  this anymore.
42) 60) dialog: This is incredible.
42) 62) dialog: That is not what I mean.

43) 83) dialog: I mean... I just think... I don't  know: We had a great little fling.  You know? Let's not push it. (Pause) I mean, is that OK? I just --
43) 86) dialog: So are we still friends?
43) 88) dialog: All right. Good...!

48) 36) dialog: I want you to leave.
48) 39) dialog: I mean I don't think you should live  here anymore. I don't think you know  how to behave around an eight-year- old and I don't know how to make you  stop, so I think you shouldn't live  here. I don't know what else to say.
48) 41) dialog: That's right --

48) 55) dialog: -- I thought -- maybe you could sell  your half of the house to me, and I  could pay you whatever it is over a  certain amount of time, and that way --
48) 58) dialog: (Very quietly) Well -- that's not what I'm saying.
