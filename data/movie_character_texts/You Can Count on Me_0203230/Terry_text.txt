Like I  just want to get out from under it!...  And here I am back in this fuckin'  hole explaining myself to you again!
13) 57) dialog: I mean, I realize I'm in no position  to, uh, basically say anything, ever --  But it's not like I'm down there in  some redneck bar in Florida having  an argument with some stripper's  boyfriend and I suddenly think, "Hey!  Maybe this'd be a good time to really  stick it to Sammy and get myself  locked up for a few months."

Or like if you told like a joke  or a story, he always had to tell a  better one? Kinda gets annoying after  a while. Plus it was pretty scummy  how he split on your mom and you...  He was a prick.

20) 82) dialog: No there isn't, man! It's narrow.  It's dull. It's a dull, narrow town  full of dull, narrow people who don't  know anything except... what things  are like right around here. They  have no perspective whatsoever. No  scope. They might as well be living  in the nineteenth century because  they have no idea what's going on,  and if you try to tell 'em that,  they wanna fuckin' kill you.

27) 7) dialog: Why? He's not gonna do anything  different than what I'm doing.
27) 9) dialog: No we're not. Shut up.
27) 10) text: Terry yanks the wrench and a SPRAY of FILTHY WATER comes of the pipe and splatters the wallpaper and pictures and  Sammy with gritty gray water. She looks at them.

27) 62) dialog: Just make sure to hit it really  gentle. But firm. And hit it a little  low so you get some backspin. Don't  even hit it. Just kiss it.

41) 3) dialog: And I also find it kind of  discouraging that you seem to think  I need some kind of spiritual  counseling or what have you, so much  so that you're willing to disregard  the fact that I don't believe in any  of this stuff at all --

41) 26) dialog: I don't know: A lot of what you're  saying has a real appeal to me, Ron.  A lot of the stuff they told us when  we were kids... But I don't want to  believe something or not believe it  because I might feel bad. I want to  believe it because I think it's true  or not... I'd like to think that my  life is important... Or that it's  connected to something important...
41) 28) dialog: Yes. I believe that.
41) 30) dialog: So Sammy, what example will you be  setting for us tonight?
