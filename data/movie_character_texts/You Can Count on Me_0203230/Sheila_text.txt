TERRY PRESCOTT comes in. He is twenty-five years old: a r mess with a certain natural appeal. He wears old jeans, v old hiking boots, and a lumberjack-style coat. He takes a wool hat off his head. His hair is longish and dirty. SHEILA SADLER is sitting at the table by the fridge. She barely eighteen, frail and damaged.
