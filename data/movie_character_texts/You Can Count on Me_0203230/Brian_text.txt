4) 13) dialog: Yeah, we missed you before...
4) 15) dialog: I'm sure it's not. Actually -- could  you just, could you close that door  for me? Thanks.
4) 19) dialog: Well -- Samantha -- I realize that  Scottsville is not exactly a major  banking center...
4) 21) dialog: No -- I know it's not... But it's  kind of a personal challenge to me  to see what we can do to bring local  service up to the same kinds of  standards we'd be trying to meet if  we were the biggest branch in the  state. And that means I don't want  anybody running out at 3:15 or 3:30,  or whenever the bus happens to come  in that day. Now is there anybody  else who can pick your son up after  school? Does your husband work in  the area? Do you --

20) 23) dialog: Yeah. I was kind of wondering what  happened to you today.
20) 25) dialog: Yeah, I kind of thought you were  gonna work that out.
20) 27) dialog: Then why're you running outta here  in the middle of the day without a  word of explanation to me, Sammy?
20) 29) dialog: I'm -- I'm not yelling. I'm just  gettin' a little frustrated here.
20) 31) dialog: Sorry, could you close the door  please?
22) 0) text: Sammy listens to Brian.
22) 1) dialog: Yeah. This doesn't apply to you  directly, Sammy, but I've noticed  that some of the employees have their  PC monitors set with all kinds of  crazy colors... Purple and polka  dots or what have you. And it's not  a big deal, but really, this is a  bank. You know? It's not really  appropriate. So I'm just asking that  people stick to a more quote unquote  normal range of colors in future...

29) 10) dialog: May I respond? (Beat) First of all, I don't appreciate  being spoken to with that kind of  language. That's not the way I talk  to you, and I'd appreciate it if you  wouldn't talk that way to me --
29) 12) dialog: Second of all, if you say you didn't  change the colors on my computer  screen, then of course I accept your  answer. But you and I are gonna have  to find a way to work together --
29) 14) dialog: But that's not gonna happen with the  attitude, it's not gonna happen with  the lateness, it's not gonna happen  by fighting me every step of the way --  OK, well not you, you're not late,  but too much of that stuff goes on  around here --
29) 16) dialog: I'd really like to finish!
29) 17) text: OUTSIDE BRIAN'S OFFICE: The whole staff is listening to t muffled raised VOICES from inside the office. MABEL especially is listening guiltily.

32) 15) dialog: Anyway... We'll work it out...
32) 17) dialog: I could use a tranquilizer.
32) 20) dialog: Must be so tough raising a kid on  your own... Although I'm beginning  to get the idea my wife wouldn't  mind a crack at it.

48) 85) dialog: Well... you made a commitment to  this bank, Sammy. To this job.
48) 87) dialog: And to working things out with this  tough new son of a bitch boss of  yours. And whatever might have passed  between us after hours doesn't mean  you just walk away from that  commitment -- yeah, even when you  have a legitimate family emergency.
