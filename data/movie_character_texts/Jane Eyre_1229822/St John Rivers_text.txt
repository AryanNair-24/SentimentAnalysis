11) 30) dialog: All of God's creatures must die. But not prematurely - and not on my doorstep I hope.
12) 6) dialog: You did your duty in excluding her. Let me do mine in admitting her.
12) 12) dialog: I don't know; I found her at the door.
12) 26) dialog: She's no vagrant; I'm sure of it.
12) 31) dialog: Ask her her name.
12) 40) dialog: Can we send for anyone? Who are your people? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 6.
22) 7) dialog: I'm sure we'll find she's simply had a misunderstanding with her people. I hope she's not done anything deplorable; there's nothing so sad as a fallen young woman.
22) 14) dialog: She's not at all handsome.
22) 18) dialog: Ill or well, she'll always be plain.
28) 10) dialog: Who can we send for to help you? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 16.
28) 16) dialog: Do you mean to say that you are absolutely without home and without friends?
28) 20) dialog: How did you come to be roaming the moors, Miss Elliott?
28) 26) dialog: How are we to help you if we know nothing about you?
28) 53) dialog: Why did you leave your place of employment?
28) 58) dialog: What did you do?
28) 68) dialog: Why did you start?
28) 76) dialog: Why not?
31) 3) dialog: Join me to thyself with an inseparable band of love... For thou, even thou alone, dost satisfy him that loveth thee...
31) 21) dialog: You wish to be independent of my charity?
31) 27) dialog: My sisters have always taken pleasure in keeping injured birds but I'm more inclined to put you in a way of keeping yourself - and shall endeavour to do so, if that's what you wish.
31) 33) dialog: This school you were at, Miss Elliot, this charitable institution; what did it prepare you for?
39) 21) dialog: How fierce I am, Miss Elliott.
39) 25) dialog: I found you a situation some days ago but I've delayed telling you because the work is lowly and I fear you'll scorn it. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 28.
39) 30) dialog: As I am poor and obscure, the help I can offer is of the meanest sort.
39) 34) dialog: When I took over the parish two years ago it had no school. I opened one for boys; I now intend to open one for girls. The school mistress will have a two-roomed cottage paid for by local benefactors and she will receive fifteen pounds a year. You can see how humble, how ignoble it is.
39) 39) dialog: But you comprehend me? It's a village school - cottagers daughters. What will you do with all your fine accomplishments?
70) 3) dialog: Do you find the work too hard?
70) 8) dialog: Do you feel the solitude an oppression?
70) 12) dialog: Then perhaps your accommodations have disappointed you. They are in truth scanty enough - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 59.
70) 18) dialog: What you had left before I met you, I don't know. But I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation to look back.
70) 22) dialog: We can overcome every kind of human weakness. A year ago I was myself intensely miserable. I considered my life was so wretched that it must be changed - or I would die. After a season of darkness and struggling, light broke. I heard my call from God. Put your trust in him, Jane. Let him lead you to your future.
70) 29) dialog: A year ago, I was weak enough to fall in love.
70) 40) dialog: A slave in a fool's paradise? I'd rather my life had purpose -
70) 50) dialog: Nothing in the world.
116) 18) dialog: How easily alarmed you are. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 102.
116) 26) dialog: Nonsense.
116) 31) dialog: An inhospitable question.
116) 35) dialog: I got tired of my mute books and empty rooms. Besides I've been told half a story and I'm most impatient to find out the end.
116) 40) dialog: Twenty years ago, a poor curate fell in love with a rich man's daughter and married her. She was disowned by her family and two years later the rash pair were both dead. They left a daughter which charity received into her lap - as cold as that snow drift I almost stuck fast in. Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations. It was reared by an aunt-in-law; I come to names now - Mrs Reed of Gateshead.
116) 50) dialog: I can guess your feelings but hear me to the end. Of Mr Rochester's character I know nothing but he professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl and at the very altar she discovered that he had a wife yet alive. His subsequent conduct is a matter of pure conjecture but when the governess was enquired after it was discovered that she had fled Thornfield Hall and no trace of her has since been found. Now isn't that an odd tale?
116) 54) dialog: Who?
116) 58) dialog: I'm ignorant of all concerning him.
116) 69) dialog: Are you not going to enquire why he has gone to such lengths to find you?
116) 73) dialog: Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr John Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that he has left you all his property and that you are now rich.
116) 77) dialog: You are rich; quite an heiress.
116) 87) dialog: Oh a trifle. Twenty thousand pounds - but what of that?
116) 94) dialog: If you'd committed a murder and I'd found you out, you could scarcely look more aghast.
116) 98) dialog: It's twenty. You look desperately miserable about it, I must say.
116) 103) dialog: You see, that is the strange thing. It makes me wonder what power or providence led you to our door. Your name is Jane Eyre.
116) 107) dialog: Then I'm you namesake. I was christened St John Eyre Rivers.
116) 111) dialog: My mother had two brothers, one was a clergyman, your father, the other was John Eyre of Madeira. Mr Briggs wrote to inform us that the clergyman's daughter was lost. I have been able to find her out; that is all.
116) 115) dialog: Yes.
116) 119) dialog: That is correct. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 106.
116) 124) dialog: We are cousins, yes.
116) 130) dialog: Here you are neglecting essential points to pursue trifles. You were utterly downhearted when I told you that you were rich and now, for a matter of no moment, you are deliriously happy.
116) 134) dialog: You must try to tranquillise your feelings.
116) 139) dialog: I've told you the news too quickly. You're confused.
116) 143) dialog: This is acting on first impulse. You don't know what it is to have
116) 153) dialog: Jane, I will be your brother.
118) 3) dialog: Good night.
118) 12) dialog: Good night.
120) 3) dialog: You are wasted here.
120) 7) dialog: You should look beyond Moor House, beyond the selfish calm and comfort of affluence.
120) 11) dialog: I go to India in six weeks.
120) 16) dialog: I can see what your gifts are and why they were given. Come with me.
120) 23) dialog: You're far too humble. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 109.
120) 28) dialog: Don't be afraid. You are diligent, faithful, docile, courageous, gentle and heroic. Cease to mistrust yourself. I trust you unreservedly. Let me give you time to think. But know this; in you, I recognise a fellow soul, a soul that would revel in the flame and excitement of sacrifice.
121) 5) dialog: Free?
121) 9) dialog: Why not?
121) 13) dialog: But you'll go with me.
121) 18) dialog: Jane, I don't need a curate; I need a wife.
121) 22) dialog: A part of me you must become or the whole bargain is void. How can I, a man not yet thirty take out to India a girl of nineteen, unless she is my wife? Don't offer God half a sacrifice. He must have all. And undoubtedly enough of love would follow to make the union right, even in your eyes.
121) 27) dialog: Yes, quite enough.
121) 32) dialog: I've uttered nothing that deserves scorn.
121) 36) dialog: No; and if you reject it, it's not me you deny but God.
121) 42) dialog: We are friends. I hope we can be more.
121) 46) dialog: Why this refusal? It makes no sense!
121) 50) dialog: 
121) 55) dialog: What nonsense is this?
121) 59) dialog: Why?
121) 63) dialog: 
121) 70) dialog: I wouldn't trample you. You'd walk at my side towards God's altar. He'd be your solace, heaven your reward. We seek to do the greatest work, to open death's gates, to save souls. Love God Jane, love God.
121) 85) dialog: What have you heard? What can you see?
