11) 14) dialog: Shelter. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 4.
11) 19) dialog: I have no strength to go.
11) 23) dialog: 
11) 27) dialog: God help me. I will die.
12) 33) dialog: I - I am J -
15) 5) dialog: What do you want?
15) 9) dialog: I have done nothing wrong. Master Reed.
15) 14) dialog: I wasn't aware it was yours.
15) 22) dialog: Wicked and cruel - you are a slaver - a murderer -
15) 26) dialog: I hate you John Reed. I hate you - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 8.
20) 5) dialog: Bessie!
20) 9) dialog: There was a light.
20) 22) dialog: No - Aunt, have pity -
20) 26) dialog: Please - I cannot bear it -
20) 30) dialog: I shall be killed -
20) 34) dialog: Have mercy, have mercy I beg you -
23) 5) dialog: They go to hell.
23) 10) dialog: A pit full of fire.
23) 14) dialog: No sir.
23) 18) dialog: I must keep in good health and not die.
24) 6) dialog: You are not fit to associate with me!
25) 3) dialog: You said I was a liar. Well I am not. If I was, I should say that I loved you and I don't. I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed. He is a liar, not I.
25) 7) dialog: I'll never call you Aunt again as long as I live and if anyone asks how I liked you I'll say that the very thought of you makes me sick. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 14.
25) 12) dialog: I'll remember how you thrust me back into the Red Room and locked me there to my dying day. Even when you knew it was haunted and I begged to be let out. People think you are good but you are bad and hard-hearted and I'll let everyone at Lowood know what you have done!
25) 16) dialog: Deceit is not my fault!
25) 20) dialog: My Uncle Reed is in heaven and can see all that you do and think; so can my mother and father. They know how you hate me and wish me dead. They can see. They see everything you do and they will judge you, Mrs Reed.
26) 5) dialog: Don't scold me Bessie. I know you dislike me -
26) 9) dialog: You don't show it. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 15.
27) 5) dialog: Jane Eyre.
28) 3) dialog: My name is Jane Elliott...
28) 13) dialog: No one.
28) 18) dialog: Yes sir.
28) 24) dialog: Mr Rivers, you and you sisters have done me a great service, the greatest man can do - you have rescued me from death.
28) 28) dialog: I'll tell you as much as I can. I am an orphan; brought up a dependent; educated in a charity school where I passed six years as a pupil and two as a teacher. I left a year since to become a private governess -
28) 33) dialog: A good situation, where I remained until...
28) 40) dialog: (with great interest) Do you?
28) 44) dialog: You're not working at present?
28) 50) dialog: I am very sorry to hear it.
28) 56) dialog: I... It was a catastrophe.
28) 60) dialog: I am free from any blame, sir. I was happy.
28) 70) dialog: Because that is not my name. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 18.
28) 78) dialog: Because I must not ever be found.
31) 14) dialog: I'd appreciate it if you called me Jane. It is my own name.
31) 19) dialog: I trust I will not be eating long at your expense, Mr Rivers.
31) 23) dialog: I wish to work, sir. Show me how to work or how to seek work; that's all I ask.
31) 29) dialog: With all my heart, sir.
31) 44) dialog: Most thorough.
33) 5) dialog: You're not allowed to speak to me. I must be shunned.
33) 9) dialog: He said I was a liar.
33) 12) dialog: 
33) 14) dialog: I am not a liar!
33) 19) dialog: How do you bear it? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 22.
33) 24) dialog: Being struck.
33) 28) dialog: If she hit me I would get that birch from her hand and break it under her nose.
33) 32) dialog: I have always been excluded and alone and hated. Miss Abbott used to call me an ugly little toad.
33) 37) dialog: What?
33) 41) dialog: What do you mean?
33) 45) dialog: Is that true?
33) 50) dialog: Angels?
34) 5) dialog: Why?
34) 13) dialog: Why ever not?
34) 17) dialog: Can he not do God's work here?
34) 30) dialog: In one thing you are fortunate.
34) 33) dialog: You have each other.
37) 3) dialog: Helen.
37) 7) dialog: You're cold.
37) 11) dialog: Back to your father?
37) 15) dialog: Then where?
37) 20) dialog: No...
37) 25) dialog: No...
37) 29) dialog: Then he must save you.
37) 36) dialog: I won't leave you.
38) 6) dialog: No, no, no -
39) 3) dialog: Have you something for me to do?
39) 8) dialog: That's Miss Temple on her wedding day. She was my teacher; a great influence on me. Under her guidance I became a teacher too.
39) 13) dialog: No, Mary, please -
39) 23) dialog: Mr Rivers, I wondered if you had yet heard of any work that I could do.
39) 28) dialog: I shan't mind what I do.
39) 37) dialog: Mr Rivers, I thank you heartily and I accept with all my heart.
39) 41) dialog: I will save them until they are wanted. They will keep.
42) 3) dialog: Yes. Excuse me.
46) 5) dialog: Are you Mrs Fairfax?
46) 25) dialog: Am I to have the pleasure of meeting Miss Fairfax tonight?
46) 29) dialog: Miss Fairfax - my pupil?
46) 33) dialog: Who is Mr Rochester?
46) 37) dialog: I thought Thornfield Hall belonged to you.
46) 41) dialog: Forgive me - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 32.
48) 13) dialog: 
48) 19) dialog: Thank you.
50) 3) dialog: What a beautiful house.
51) 9) dialog: 
51) 15) dialog: Her mother has passed away.
51) 20) dialog: 
53) 4) dialog: Who's there?
53) 8) dialog: Who sleeps up here?
53) 12) dialog: I heard someone.
53) 16) dialog: A laugh. Someone laughed.
54) 6) dialog: I'm not in need of tea, thank you.
54) 11) dialog: Oh, Mrs Fairfax, no. I'm so thankful to be at Thornfield. Please don't think I'm so ungrateful as to be discontented.
54) 16) dialog: I wish a woman could have action in her life, like a man. It agitates me to pain that the sky- line over there is ever our limit. I long sometimes for a power of vision that would overpass it. If I could behold all I imagine... I've never seen a city, never spoken with men. I've never even seen a town of any size. And I fear my whole life will pass, without ever having...
56) 15) dialog: Can I do anything, sir?
56) 28) dialog: Are you injured, sir?
56) 31) dialog: If you are hurt and want help I can fetch someone from the village. I'm on my way there to post a letter.
56) 36) dialog: Thornfield Hall.
56) 40) dialog: Mr Rochester's.
56) 44) dialog: No, I've never seen him.
56) 49) dialog: I am the governess, sir. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 39.
56) 60) dialog: No.
56) 88) dialog: Oh?
56) 92) dialog: I have to change?
56) 96) dialog: But all my dresses are the same.
57) 13) dialog: Thank you.
57) 17) dialog: Yes, sir.
57) 21) dialog: Pardon?
57) 25) dialog: 
57) 30) dialog: Dead.
57) 35) dialog: No.
57) 39) dialog: She cast me off, sir.
57) 43) dialog: Because I was burdensome and she disliked me.
57) 47) dialog: Yes.
57) 51) dialog: Eight years.
57) 67) dialog: Yes sir.
57) 72) dialog: Out of my head.
57) 76) dialog: Yes sir.
57) 81) dialog: The evening star.
58) 9) dialog: What for? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 44.
58) 14) dialog: Why?
60) 21) dialog: How, sir?
60) 42) dialog: No sir. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 46.
60) 46) dialog: I was too plain; I beg your pardon.
60) 51) dialog: Mr Rochester, it was a blunder. I ought to have replied that beauty is of little consequence -
60) 56) dialog: You have other qualities, sir.
60) 60) dialog: Not at all.
60) 68) dialog: What about, sir?
60) 72) dialog: How can I introduce a subject when I don't know what'll interest you? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 47.
60) 77) dialog: Yet you'd command me to speak?
60) 81) dialog: I don't think you have a right to command me just because you're older. Your claim to superiority depends on the use you've made of your time and experience.
60) 86) dialog: There are few masters who'd trouble to enquire whether their paid subordinates were hurt by their commands.
60) 90) dialog: I'd never mistake informality for insolence, sir. One, I rather like. The other, nothing free born should ever submit to - even for a salary.
60) 97) dialog: You've clearly not spent much time in the company of schoolgirl governesses. I'm the same plain kind of bird as all the rest, with my couple of accomplishments and my common tale of woe.
60) 101) dialog: How?
60) 105) dialog: Are you a villain then, sir?
60) 113) dialog: Then you'll degenerate still more.
60) 118) dialog: I'm reminding you of your own words; remorse is the poison of life.
60) 122) dialog: I don't know. To speak truth, I don't understand you at all.
60) 126) dialog: Sir, I find the conversation has got out of my depth.
60) 130) dialog: I'm not afraid.
60) 134) dialog: I've simply no wish to talk nonsense.
61) 3) dialog: Just as it turns to come down - that's when you hit it.
61) 8) dialog: Mademoiselle has got to rest.
61) 12) dialog: Have mercy, Adele. Play with Pilot for a while.
61) 15) dialog: Is our game disturbing you, sir?
61) 37) dialog: To fall in love, sir?
61) 41) dialog: Does it?
61) 45) dialog: Were you dashed to pieces, Mr Rochester?
61) 52) dialog: But you took her on?
63) 3) dialog: Who's there?
63) 8) dialog: Wake up! Wake up! Sir!
63) 13) dialog: It is I, Jane Eyre, sir.
63) 19) dialog: For heaven's sake get up. Somebody has plotted something; you must find out who. I'll light the lamp - Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 54.
63) 25) dialog: I heard a laugh outside my door loud enough to wake me. I opened it. Someone was running towards the third floor.
63) 28) dialog: And a candle was left burning in the middle of the floor. Shall I fetch Mrs Fairfax, sir?
63) 32) dialog: Then I'll wake John and Martha.
64) 6) dialog: Only the candle on the ground. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 55.
64) 11) dialog: Yes.
64) 15) dialog: There's a woman who sews here; Grace Poole - She laughs in that way, I think.
64) 19) dialog: 
64) 24) dialog: Yes, sir. (She takes off his coat) Good-night.
64) 28) dialog: You said I should go.
64) 33) dialog: What am I to do then, sir?
64) 41) dialog: There is no debt.
64) 46) dialog: Good night then, sir.
64) 50) dialog: I'm cold.
66) 5) dialog: What's happened here?
66) 13) dialog: I did. I heard a strange laugh.
66) 17) dialog: I was not.
67) 3) dialog: Has Mr Rochester not sent for us today?
67) 10) dialog: Oh?
68) 5) dialog: (without looking at her) Nothing. Speak in English, please.
69) 3) dialog: Thank you, girls. You may go.
70) 6) dialog: Not at all. I'm getting on very well.
70) 10) dialog: I hardly have time to notice it.
70) 15) dialog: A few months ago I had nothing. I was wretched. Now I have a home and work; free and honest. I wonder at the goodness of God and at the generosity of my friends.
70) 20) dialog: It's what I mean to do.
70) 24) dialog: Thank you.
70) 27) dialog: Why were you intensely miserable?
70) 38) dialog: You could have been happy.
70) 45) dialog: Yes.
70) 48) dialog: What's the matter?
71) 11) dialog: May I assist you, Mrs Fairfax?
74) 5) dialog: Excuse me, miss.
75) 4) dialog: What is it, darling?
76) 6) dialog: Not me, surely.
76) 10) dialog: He was being polite.
77) 3) dialog: May I present Miss Adele Varens?
77) 77) dialog: I am tired, sir.
77) 81) dialog: You seemed engaged, sir.
77) 85) dialog: Teaching Adele.
77) 90) dialog: I am well.
77) 116) dialog: Can I help you sir?
77) 122) dialog: Turn them out of the room sir, if I could.
77) 126) dialog: I should care nothing about it.
77) 131) dialog: For the sake of any friend who deserved it.
82) 12) dialog: It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.
83) 3) dialog: Will Grace Poole stay here now?
83) 7) dialog: But sir -
83) 15) dialog: Yes sir.
83) 19) dialog: Yes sir.
83) 24) dialog: I'd do anything for you sir, anything that was right.
85) 3) dialog: Excuse me, sir.
86) 3) dialog: If you please, I want leave of absence for a week or two.
86) 8) dialog: This is from my old nurse, Bessie. She says my cousin John Reed is dead. He ruined himself and has committed suicide. The news has so shocked his mother, my Aunt, that it's brought on a stroke.
86) 12) dialog: She's been asking for me. I parted from her very badly and I can't neglect her wishes now.
86) 16) dialog: Sir, it seems you are soon to be married.
86) 20) dialog: Adele should go to school.
86) 24) dialog: And I must seek another situation. I intend to advertise. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 75.
86) 30) dialog: And sir? Forgive me but I have had no wages as yet.
86) 34) dialog: Fifteen pounds.
86) 39) dialog: That's too much.
86) 43) dialog: I cannot.
86) 47) dialog: 
86) 55) dialog: 
87) 6) dialog: Bessie... I'm not too late? How is Mrs Reed?
87) 10) dialog: Shall I see her now?
88) 3) dialog: Aunt Reed? It is Jane Eyre. You sent for me, and here I am.
88) 8) dialog: Why do you hate her so?
88) 16) dialog: I am Jane Eyre, Aunt.
88) 21) dialog: We are alone.
88) 25) dialog: Please, don't think of it -
88) 33) dialog: 'Madam, will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane Eyre. I desire her to come to me at Madeira. Fortune has blessed my endeavours and as I am childless I wish to adopt her and bequeath her at my death whatever I may have to leave. Yours, John Eyre, Madeira.'
88) 36) dialog: This is dated three years ago. Why did I never hear of it?
88) 43) dialog: Forgive me.
88) 47) dialog: I would have loved you if you'd let me.
88) 51) dialog: Please, let us be reconciled.
88) 54) dialog: Then love me or hate me as you will. You have my full and free forgiveness. Now ask for God's - and be at peace.
89) 4) dialog: My mother.
89) 7) dialog: Why ever was I so afraid?
91) 10) dialog: I have been with my aunt sir, who is dead.
91) 19) dialog: Thank you Mr Rochester. I'm strangely glad to get back again to you. Wherever you are is my home.
92) 6) dialog: Then we must accept it. He'll soon bring home his bride.
93) 11) dialog: I'll be sad to leave it.
93) 15) dialog: Have you found me a new situation, sir?
93) 20) dialog: Connaught?
93) 24) dialog: It is a long way away, sir.
93) 28) dialog: From here. From you.
93) 33) dialog: I wish I could. I wish I'd never come here. I love Thornfield - I've lived a full life here. I've not been trampled on or petrified or buried with inferior minds. I've talked face to face with what I reverence, with what I delight in. I've known you Mr Rochester -
93) 37) dialog: Because of your bride.
93) 41) dialog: But you will have.
93) 45) dialog: Then I must go.
93) 49) dialog: Do you think I could stay to become nothing to you? Am I an automaton, a machine without feelings?
93) 52) dialog: Do you think that because I am poor, obscure, plain and little that I am soulless and heartless?
93) 55) dialog: 
93) 57) dialog: I have as much soul as you and full as much heart. I'm not speaking to you through mortal flesh. It's my spirit that addresses your spirit as if we'd passed through the grave and stood at God's feet, equal - as we are.
93) 63) dialog: Let me go.
93) 68) dialog: I'm a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you.
93) 76) dialog: Are you mocking me?
93) 80) dialog: Entirely. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 83.
93) 85) dialog: Not a whit.
93) 89) dialog: Your bride is Miss Ingram -
93) 94) dialog: Are you in earnest?
93) 98) dialog: You wish me to be your wife?
93) 102) dialog: You love me.
93) 106) dialog: Then sir, I will marry you.
93) 117) dialog: I must go.
93) 122) dialog: Good night.
94) 5) dialog: Yes.
94) 10) dialog: Am I a monster? Is it so impossible that Mr Rochester should love me?
94) 15) dialog: Thank you. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 85.
95) 5) dialog: It is I, Jane Eyre sir.
95) 9) dialog: It can never be, sir. Human beings were not meant to enjoy complete happiness on this earth. It's too much like a fairy tale.
96) 5) dialog: Oh, no sir -
96) 9) dialog: I don't want jewels -
96) 13) dialog: Then you won't know me. I'll not be Jane Eyre any longer but an ape in a harlequin's jacket. Put them away.
96) 19) dialog: I'm naturally proud. And hard and flinty. You ought to know what sort of bargain you've made while you've still got time to rescind it. I want only one thing from you, Mr Rochester.
96) 23) dialog: Your regard.
98) 2) dialog: Adele?
98) 5) dialog: Adele, is that you? Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 87.
100) 6) dialog: I'm afraid.
101) 6) dialog: It was not Grace Poole.
101) 11) dialog: I was not asleep.
101) 15) dialog: I know what I saw.
108) 16) dialog: Thank you.
113) 4) dialog: Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 95.
113) 16) dialog: I cannot.
113) 21) dialog: I'm tired and sick. I need some water.
114) 5) dialog: Much better, sir. I shall be well again soon.
114) 11) dialog: All is changed, sir. I must change too.
114) 15) dialog: Sir - you speak of her with hate - it is cruel. She cannot help being mad.
114) 19) dialog: I do.
114) 23) dialog: No.
114) 27) dialog: You can't.
114) 31) dialog: I must leave you, sir.
114) 37) dialog: I do love you - But I mustn't show it or speak it ever again. I must begin a new existence - strange scenes among strange faces. I must part from you.
114) 41) dialog: You have a wife already.
114) 54) dialog: I earnestly pity you, sir.
114) 59) dialog: Do not say it -
114) 63) dialog: 
114) 69) dialog: I can not.
114) 73) dialog: How?
114) 77) dialog: You once told me that hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave.
114) 82) dialog: I would not degrade you by having you live with a slave.
114) 90) dialog: I do.
114) 97) dialog: I do.
114) 109) dialog: I would.
114) 113) dialog: It would be to obey you. I care for myself. Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 100.
114) 117) dialog: The more alone, the more friendless, unsustained I am, the more I must respect myself -
114) 121) dialog: I must listen to myself -
114) 125) dialog: Let me go -
114) 135) dialog: 
116) 4) dialog: Edward.
116) 16) dialog: Mr St John - What on earth brings you away from your hearth on a night like this? Has anything happened? There's no bad news I hope?
116) 24) dialog: You are recklessly rash about your own health.
116) 29) dialog: Why are you come?
116) 33) dialog: I mean on a night like this -
116) 37) dialog: Please...
116) 48) dialog: Mr Rivers! -
116) 52) dialog: Since you know so much, perhaps you can tell me how he is.
116) 56) dialog: Mr Rochester; how is he?
116) 67) dialog: The solicitor - Mr Briggs - does he have any news of Mr Rochester?
116) 71) dialog: What does he want with me?
116) 75) dialog: What?
116) 85) dialog: How much am I worth?
116) 90) dialog: Twenty thousand pounds?
116) 96) dialog: There must be some mistake. It's two thousand, surely.
116) 101) dialog: Why did Mr Briggs write to you?
116) 105) dialog: Yes.
116) 109) dialog: St John Eyre -
116) 113) dialog: Your mother was my father's sister?
116) 117) dialog: My uncle John was your uncle John?
116) 122) dialog: So you, Diana and Mary -
116) 127) dialog: Oh, I am glad! - I am glad!
116) 132) dialog: Of no moment? You have sisters and maybe don't care for a cousin but I have nobody. I have been alone, always. And now three relations are born into my world full grown. Oh, I am glad. You, who saved my life -
116) 137) dialog: Write to Diana and Mary. Tell them to hand in notice and come home. They will have five thousand each and so will you.
116) 141) dialog: Don't put me out of patience, cousin. I am rational enough. Twenty thousand divided equally between the nieces and nephews of our uncle, gives five to each.
116) 147) dialog: And you cannot imagine - family - I never had a home. I never had brothers and sisters -
116) 150) dialog: You are not reluctant to own me, are you?
118) 8) dialog: Di, you are very provoking.
120) 5) dialog: Am I not being useful?
120) 9) dialog: Beyond to what?
120) 13) dialog: So soon? -
120) 21) dialog: I'm not fit for it. I have no vocation.
120) 26) dialog: St John have mercy. I feel my mind shrinking -
121) 3) dialog: I used to long for a life of action, to overleap the horizon, to move in the world of men. Maybe God is giving me this. And what is there for me here? Pain and longing for what can't be. I don't know how long I would survive in India. My frame isn't strong. But I'll go with you, if I may go free.
121) 7) dialog: You and I had better not marry.
121) 11) dialog: Because I am your sister.
