10) 1) dialog: (sighs deeply)
11) 1) dialog: Okay, I might have strayed from my notes a little. I'm dealing with a lot of stuff here. Grief is a process. Laura notices FBI AGENTS CERRONE and MILLER waiting for t in the living room. Cerrone is an attractive woman in her late twenties, wearing a dangerously-short skirt. Miller a clean-cut man in his thirties.
11) 6) dialog: Thank you, I'm going to miss him
11) 8) dialog: I mean -- there were issues -- as, I think, there are with any father and son. He wasn't especially warm --
11) 10) dialog: No, I'm just saying, in spite of all that -- Agent Cerrone crosses her legs, a move that does not go unnoticed by Ben and Michael.
11) 11) dialog: -- he was a great, great legs. (beat)
11) 14) dialog: What makes you think Paul Vitti called me?
11) 16) dialog: Then yes.   He did.
11) 18) dialog: Yes.
11) 21) dialog: Michael?
11) 25) dialog: She's with the F.B.I.   She needs to know these things.
11) 27) dialog: Did I say that?
11) 29) dialog: No, we're fine.
11) 32) dialog: She's grieving. It's a process.
11) 35) dialog: Oh, yes. Paul Vitti and I were involved in some organized crime activity a couple of years ago. I mean, I wasn't involved -- not 'involved' involved -- I was just trying to help him therapeutically, and some people tried to, uh, kill us. No big deal.
11) 38) dialog: What kind of breakdown?

14) 11) dialog: Paul?   Paul? Ben waves a hand in front of Vitti's face.       Nothing.
14) 13) dialog: (skeptical)
15) 1) dialog: You already did a neurological work- up?
15) 4) dialog: Completely catatonic -- He pulls on Vitti's ears and nose.     Vitti does not rea
15) 5) dialog: Totally gone. Well, I don't think he's smart enough to be faking. Street smart, yes, but we're talking about an I.Q. just north of a bedroom slipper. Ben checks Vitti out of the corner of his eye. No reactio Then Ben takes a sharp needle from an instrument tray.
15) 6) dialog: So if I just stuck him with this needle, he probably wouldn't even respond.
15) 8) dialog: Okay -- He sticks the needle into Vitti's shoulder.
16) 0) text: Vitti is sitting at a table facing Ben.     Dr. Cutler ob from a chair in the corner.
16) 1) dialog: Paul, we're going to    give you some tests to assess your    mental condition. There's no pressure    -- just answer as best you can. Do I     have your consent to share the results    of these tests?
16) 4) dialog: I'll take that as a yes. Okay, I'm going to show you ten cards, each containing a picture of an inkblot. I want you to look at each card and tell me what you see.
16) 6) dialog: Focus, Paul. You haven't seen the card yet. (hands him first card)
16) 9) dialog: No, Paul, the other side. Vitti turns it over and makes a face.
16) 11) dialog: (taking notes)
16) 15) dialog: (skeptical)
16) 19) dialog: (making more notes)
16) 25) dialog: Now try repeating the numbers backwards. For instance, if I was 1- 2-3, you will say 3-2-1. Okay, 7-3-8.
16) 28) dialog: Try again.   7-3-8.
16) 32) dialog: Just tell me what you think is going on in this picture.

16) 43) dialog: Okay, Paul. Last test. In this one, I'm going to start a sentence and you complete it any way you want to. Ready? 'I get angry -- '
16) 45) dialog: No, you're supposed to complete the sentence.
16) 47) dialog: I wasn't asking if you agreed or disagreed; it was more like, 'I get angry when -- '

17) 1) dialog: Based on his symptoms and the test results, I'd say brief psychotic disorder -- if it persists, possibly schizophreniform disorder. And Dr. Cutler agrees with my diagnosis.
17) 4) dialog: Dr. Cutler?   No, he's annoying, but --
17) 6) dialog: Not crazy. At least not permanently. In certain people, continuous exposure to an extremely stressful situation -- soldiers in combat, for instance, disaster victims, a hostage situation, or being locked up in a maximum security prison with someone trying to kill you -- it can produce a temporary psychotic state.
17) 8) dialog: A day, a week, up to a month -- if the precipitating stressors are removed.
17) 10) dialog: He could get worse. He could deteriorate to the point where he'd be permanently schizophrenic.
17) 12) dialog: You think they'll let him out?
17) 14) dialog: (thinks) Well, couldn't you release him to    a halfway house or some place where    he could get some decent treatment? Based on my earlier work with him,    I don't think he's dangerous, and I think he was making a real effort    to reform himself.
17) 17) dialog: Mine? Me? No, this is a bad time for me. My father just died -- and I've got this bulging disc in my neck -- and we're redecorating, which is a total nightmare. I can't --
17) 19) dialog: No, of course not.
17) 21) dialog: No --
17) 23) dialog: (stricken) What?    I can't be an institution.
17) 25) dialog: (gulp) Yes.    We're clear.
17) 28) dialog: (long beat to decide)

19) 17) dialog: I loved my father. I'm feeling a lot of grief right now.
19) 21) dialog: Decongestant. I'm getting over a cold. All right, what's going on? Who's after you?
19) 24) dialog: Why "The Wrench"?
19) 26) dialog: Off?
19) 28) dialog: I'm sure they'd be flattered.    So --
19) 30) dialog: So what does that have to do with you?
19) 32) dialog: Maybe if you just explain to them -- that you're out of it now, that you're starting a new life --
19) 34) dialog: You are, aren't you?
20) 2) dialog: Want to grab your stuff?
20) 4) dialog: Paul! I don't think you understand. You're in my custody. I could get in a lot of trouble if you screw up.
20) 6) dialog: Oh, no. You want to go back to Sing Sing? Thursday's meatloaf night. I can have you back there in no time. The U.S. Attorney was very clear. You stay with me; therapy every day; you can't leave the area without permission --
20) 8) dialog: And you    have to get a job as soon as you're    well enough, which is now. So are you    coming in with me or do I have to make    a phone call? Vitti relents and grabs his stuff from the back seat.

22) 14) dialog: Honey, your teeth are fine. I know it's an imposition, but what could I do? I didn't want him here. They -
22) 26) dialog: You'll have to forgive her.     She's usually a great hostess.
22) 28) dialog: Emily fuckin' Post. Well, that explains why she rarely used her middle name.
22) 30) dialog: What    kind of friend? Because if it's 'The    Wrench,' or 'The Power Drill' or any    other kind of tool    --
22) 32) dialog: They won't stay late, will they?
22) 36) dialog: I'm not -- this has nothing to do with Laura.
22) 38) dialog: We were having a disagreement. A certain amount of conflict is normal in a marriage.
22) 40) dialog: Or what?
22) 42) dialog: Paul --

24) 5) dialog: I know the last few weeks have been kind of tough with Grandpa -- dying and everything -- and it might've felt to you like I didn't have time for you or I didn't care about how you feel.
24) 7) dialog: Good. Because I want you to know that you can talk to me about stuff and that I can really listen and understand what you're going through.
24) 9) dialog: And if I seemed a little hard on Grandpa, it's just that your grandfather was a hard man in a lot of ways. He wanted everything done his way and sometimes I just felt like nothing I ever did was good enough. I don't want it to be that way with us.
24) 11) dialog: And you know, at times like this we all might start questioning our own mortality and you might be thinking how devastated you'd be if I died. Right?
24) 13) dialog: That's good. Good talk. And I realize it's all a little hectic right now, but this Paul Vitti thing is only temporary, okay?
24) 15) dialog: That's not funny.   Good night, Michael.
26) 0) text: The room is dark. We PAN UP the foot of Ben and Laura's b and find them both wide awake staring straight up at the ceiling, listening.

26) 4) dialog: Let them? How much longer can he go? Another twenty minutes, I'm either breaking it up or calling the Guinness Book of Records. The MOANING shifts into low gear, more guttural and besti

31) 5) dialog: Go to a hotel.
31) 7) dialog: I'm not trying to punish you. These aren't my rules, but I have a responsibility here. Besides, I thought you might like a nice home- cooked meal after being in prison that long.
31) 11) dialog: That girl is not staying here.
31) 13) dialog: Oh, yeah, I'm really jealous.
31) 15) dialog: We don't think it's necessary to wake the neighbors every time we have sex.

33) 5) dialog: Ah ah ah! He points Vitti to the sofa and takes his own chair.
33) 6) dialog: So what are you going to do, Paul?
33) 8) dialog: With your life.
33) 11) dialog: Okay, that's a priority. Have you thought about what you're going to do for work?
33) 13) dialog: Come on. There must be something you like to do.
33) 15) dialog: Oh, sporting goods. We'll check the want ads tomorrow but don't get your hopes up. Anything else?
33) 17) dialog: Who are you?
33) 19) dialog: I know that.   I mean what are you?
33) 21) dialog: I just want to know how you see yourself.
33) 24) dialog: Just answer the question.     What are you?
33) 27) dialog: Really? The boss of what -- Jelly? You're not the boss of me. So what are you the boss of?
33) 29) dialog: What am I doing, Paul?
33) 31) dialog: I understand.
33) 32) dialog: You've    spent your whole life becoming who you    are and now you can't be that anymore    -- that's gotta be scary. If you're    not Paul Vitti the mob boss, who are    you? Vitti is at a loss.
33) 33) dialog: Well, let's think. When you were a kid, What did you want to be?
33) 35) dialog: You must've wanted to be something when you were little -- fireman?
33) 37) dialog: Baseball player?
33) 40) dialog: Astronaut?
33) 42) dialog: Al Capone?
33) 44) dialog: We're not talking about me.
33) 46) dialog: Fine.   I wanted to be a philatelist.
33) 48) dialog: No, Paul, I believe you're thinking of a proctologist. I wanted to collect rare and unusual stamps.
33) 50) dialog: Oh yeah. Big time.      So what did you want to be?
33) 52) dialog: You afraid to tell me?
33) 54) dialog: Then tell me.    I'm not here to judge you.

33) 65) dialog: Paul!
33) 67) dialog: Interesting.   They're all good guys.
33) 69) dialog: No, that's important. You didn't want to be the bad guy. You wanted to be the hero.
33) 72) dialog: So what happened?
33) 74) dialog: So why didn't you become a cowboy?
33) 76) dialog: Something else happened when you were twelve.
33) 78) dialog: (prompting)
33) 81) dialog: Something else.
33) 83) dialog: Paul! Your father was murdered! Right in front of you. Remember?
33) 85) dialog: It's got everything   to do with it. He gave you the cowboy   suit. With a white hat. He was    in the mob, but he wanted you to be a   good guy, didn't he? Vitti starts thinking about his father and starts to weep
33) 88) dialog: He didn't want you in the gang life. He only did it himself so you wouldn't have to. He was trying to buy you a better life than his.
33) 91) dialog: Well, Paul, this could be a  great opportunity for you. You're   right back where you were when you  were twelve. You've got some big   choices to make. Vitti fights to regain control.
33) 93) dialog: It's not shit, Paul. My point is, when you're a child, you think anything is possible. Wouldn't it be great to think like that now?
33) 96) dialog: I'm just saying you've got to keep an open mind and explore some new possibilities. Try some different things -- maybe you'll connect with one of them. There's a career counselor I work with. I can call him for you. He may be able to help you find a job.
33) 100) dialog: How do you know unless you try? Suddenly one of the WINDOWS behind Vitti SHATTERS. Ben dives for cover. Silence -- then another RAP on the window. Ben looks out and sees JELLY in the back yard, tossing stones at the window.
