A brief, imperious gesture of the demon’s head... and a METALLIC FRAGMENT, jaggedly pointed like a badly- made Shuriken, suddenly rises up from the wrecked robot spinning fast and furiously as if by magic... and then HURTLES ACROSS THE ROOM! Before he can even react, it slams into Parker - SLICING HIS FACE OFF!!

This is our first clear look at the other two Cenobites: is brand-new, A SIAMESE-TWIN CENOBITE joined at the side the head and at the lower chest and the hips. The other is Angelique. Though her face and figure are st beautiful, she has been “Cenobitised”: Like all Cenobites is bald and blue-skinned and her individuality has given to the leather-and-mutilation uniform of Pinhead’s troops She looks at the living quarters, at Paul’s deliberate 18 century look.
