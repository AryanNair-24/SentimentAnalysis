It's frequently used to decompose roadkill dumped in landfills, as it prevents the growth of microorganisms, therefore neutralizing and immobilizing acidic components formed in the decomposition process.

32) 110) dialog: This is exactly what we talked about -- He’s a cop, it’s the perfect cover. He can plant evidence to make someone else look guilty! If Mackey’s got these bodies, all he’d have to do is plant one in someone’s yard. Boom -- They’ve got a suspect.
32) 112) dialog: I’m not wrong! I know there’s something behind that locked door! We have to find out what before some innocent guy takes the rap for Mackey and more people die! 84.
