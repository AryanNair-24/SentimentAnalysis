When Joe gets here, he'll make ya a hundred percent again. Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress.  He' still holding his hand.  Mr. Orange looks up at his friend.

12) 6) dialog: Tell him to come in. Teddy leaves.
12) 7) dialog: (into phone)
12) 9) text: Good enough, bye. He hangs up the phone, stands, and walks around to the front of the desk. Teddy opens the office door, and TOOTHPICK VIC VEGA walks in. Toothpick Vic Vega is none other than our very own Mr. Blonde.  Vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies style jacket. Joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open. The two men embrace each other.  Teddy leaves, closing th door behind him.
12) 10) dialog: How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin good, ain't it?

12) 15) dialog: (while he pours the drink)
12) 18) dialog: How is he?
12) 20) dialog: Never ceases to amaze me.  Fuckin jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty-five cents.  Fuckin nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer.  But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin prick. Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair. Vic swallows some Remy.
12) 22) dialog: What the hell did you expect me to do?  Just forget about you?
12) 24) dialog: It's the least I could do Vic.  I wish I coulda done more. (Joe flashes a side grin at Vic)
12) 27) dialog: Come in. The door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie. Vic turns around in his seat and sees him.
12) 36) text: I'm not tellin tales out of school.  You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
12) 37) dialog: Eddie, I hate like hell for you to hear it this way.  But when Vic asked me how's business, well, you don't lie to a man who's just done four years in the slammer for ya. Eddie bobs his head up and down.
12) 39) text: Eddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor. The two friends, laughing and cussing at each other, wrestle on the floor of Joe's office. Joe's on his feet yelling at them.
12) 40) dialog: (yelling)
12) 43) dialog: What?
12) 51) dialog: Are you two finished?  We were talkin about some serious shit when you came in Eddie.  We got a big problem we're tryin to solve. Now Eddie, would you like to sit down and help us solve it, or do you two wanna piss fart around? Playtime is over and Vic and Eddie know it.  So they both take seats in front of Joe's desk.
12) 52) dialog: Now Vic was tellin me, he's got a parole problem.
12) 59) dialog: (to Eddie)
12) 64) dialog: (to Vic)
12) 70) dialog: Well, it's kinda a strange time right now.  Things are kinda--
12) 72) dialog: Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach.  Give ya some cash, get that Koons fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
12) 74) dialog: How would you feel about pullin a heist with about five other guys?
12) 76) dialog: Two minutes, tops.  It's a tough two minutes.  It's a hold up, daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd.  But you have the fellas to deal with the crowd.  It's a jewelry store. They're getting a big shipment of South African diamonds on a certain day.  They're like a way station.  It's gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Hamburg. When you walk through the door, you'll know right where to go for the rich stones. The fellas are good, me and Nice Guy picked em.  Nobody knows anybody else.  Nobody's connected. I don't use connected guys for this shit.
12) 78) dialog: Juicy, man, real juicy. Toothpick Vic smiles. So does Nice Guy Eddie.
16) 2) text: Hey, Nice Guy, we got a     You're askin what's goin cop.                        on?  Where the fuck is  Joe?
16) 53) text: Look, this is the news.  Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two.  White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you. Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse talking amongst themselves.
26) 0) text: Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around table in a red-lighted smokey bar.  Freddy continues his story.  The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.
26) 4) dialog: You're picking the buyer up at the train station?  You're carrying the weed on you?
36) 0) text: The four men enter the building. At the other end of the warehouse, sitting in chairs, are Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue and Joe Cabot. We shoot this from OVERHEAD, looking down on the men.
36) 1) dialog: (to everybody)
36) 3) text: "All I gotta do is take my pinky and tickle my Fifi's little oo la la  and she rises a foot off the bed." Back to Joe. So the dago says:
36) 5) dialog: (in a good Brooklyn accent)
36) 7) text: "You guys ain't no cocksmen. When I get through fuckin my Sophie, I wipe my dick on the curtains and you know what?  She hits the roof!" Joe laughs like a crazy man.
36) 8) dialog: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! We hear a lot of laughing OFF SCREEN.
36) 9) dialog: Ain't that a masterpiece?  Stupid fuckin Polack, wipes his dick on the drapes. Joe's eyes greet the new arrivals.
36) 10) dialog: You're here, great! Joe EXITS C.U. We now have everybody from the Uncle Bob's Pancake House scene together again.  Some sit on folding chairs, some stand.  Joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table. A blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to the right. We do a 360 around the men.
36) 12) dialog: No hurry. (to the boys)
36) 13) text: All right, let's get to know one another.  With the exception of Eddie and myself, who you already know, you'll be using aliases. Under no circumstances are you to tell one another your real name or anything else about yourself. That includes where you're from, your wife's name, where you might've done time, about a bank in St. Petersburg you might've robbed.  You guys don't say shit about who you are, where you been or what you've done.  Only thing you guys can talk about is what you're going to do.  This way the only ones who know who the members of the team are are Eddie and myself.  And that's the way I like it.  Because in the unlikely event of one of you getting apprehended by the cops, not that I expect that to happen - it most definitely should not happen - it hasn't happened, you don't have anything to deal with.  You don't know any names.  You know my name, you know Eddie's name.  That I don't care about.  You gotta prove it.  I ain't worried.  Besides, this way you gotta trust me.  I like that.  I set this up and picked the men I wanted for it. None of you came to me, I approached all of you.  I know you.  I know your work, I know your reputation.  I know you as men.  Except for this guy. Joe points a finger at Freddy. Freddy shits a brick.
36) 14) dialog: But he's OK.  If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here.  Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name... (Joe searches for the right words)
36) 18) dialog: Cause you're a faggot. Everybody laughs.
36) 20) dialog: I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black.  Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down.  So forget it, I pick.  Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
36) 23) dialog: You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
36) 26) dialog: Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin city counsel meeting!  Listen up Mr. Pink.  We got two ways here, my way or the highway.  And you can go down either of 'em.  So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
36) 28) dialog: Okay fellas, let's get into this.
42) 23) text: Look, he's not sayin this bitch is gonna operate on him.  She's gonna give him better attention than we can until we can get a doctor. Nobody's forgotten about doctors. Joe'll get one in a snap.  This is something we're doing in the meantime.  I think both of you are actin like a couple of assholes.
43) 27) dialog: (pointing to Mr. Orange)
43) 30) dialog: That's okay, Eddie, I do.
43) 33) dialog: (pointing to Mr. Orange)
43) 36) dialog: I said this lump of shit is workin with the LAPD.
43) 37) text: Looking up from the floor at everybody. Joe looks down at Mr. Orange.
43) 38) dialog: Aren't you?
43) 41) text: Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
43) 42) dialog: Like hell I am.
43) 44) text: Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake.  He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin pissed.  We're all real emotional.  But you're barking up the wrong tree.  I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
43) 45) dialog: You don't know jack shit.  I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
43) 47) dialog: Dead as Dillinger.
43) 50) dialog: He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on.  I should have my fucking head examined for goin forward when I wasn't a hundred percent.  But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
43) 53) dialog: You don't need proof when you got instinct.  I ignored it before, but not no more. He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange. Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe. Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of firearms. Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.
43) 57) dialog: Don't worry, Eddie.  Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot.  We like each other too much.
43) 62) dialog: Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
43) 64) dialog: Larry, I'm askin you to trust me on this.
43) 66) dialog: I'm not askin, I'm betting. Joe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.
