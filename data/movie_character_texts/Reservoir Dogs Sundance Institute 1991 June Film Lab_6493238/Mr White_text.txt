0) 28) dialog: Give me this fucking thing.
0) 30) dialog: I'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe, I'll give it back when we leave.
0) 32) dialog: For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names.  "Toby...Toby...Toby... Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan."  I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't- know-what, outta my left.

0) 65) dialog: I don't believe in it.
0) 70) dialog: Don't give me that.  She don't make enough money, she can quit. Everybody laughs.
0) 72) dialog: I don't tip because society says I gotta.  I tip when somebody deserves a tip.  When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds.  As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin their job.
0) 74) dialog: Our girl was okay.  She didn't do anything special.
0) 79) dialog: The words "too busy" shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.

0) 93) dialog: Fuck all that. They all laugh.
0) 94) dialog: Hey, I'm very sorry that the government taxes their tips. That's fucked up.  But that ain't my fault.  it would appear that waitresses are just one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis. You show me a paper says the government shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.  Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it.  But what I won't do is play ball.  And this non- college bullshit you're telling me, I got two words for that: "Learn to fuckin type."  Cause if you're expecting me to help out with the rent, you're in for a big fuckin surprise.

He's behind the wheel of the getaway car.  He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in an out of traffic.  Though he's driving for his life, he keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat. They are the only two in the car.

2) 31) dialog: As opposed to good?
2) 33) dialog: You really think we were set up?
2) 36) dialog: I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there.  And after we got away, I've just been dealin with him.
2) 38) dialog: Let's go in the other room... The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner.  We move past it, and see down a hall.
3) 0) text: At the end of the hall is a bathroom.  The bathroom door is partially closed, restricting our view.  Mr. Pink is obscured, but Mr. White is in view.

3) 4) dialog: Splash some water on your face. Take a breather. We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on his face.

8) 2) dialog: A few cops.
8) 4) dialog: Uh-uh, just cops.
8) 6) dialog: That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
8) 8) dialog: That's the way I look at it.  A choice between doin ten years, and takin out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all.  But I ain't no madman either.  What the fuck was Joe thinkin?  You can't work with a guy like that.  That mother- fucker's unstable.  What do you think?  Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger- happy?
8) 11) dialog: What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin professional.  A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
8) 13) dialog: Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
8) 15) dialog: What do you think?

8) 21) dialog: How can you be so sure?
8) 23) dialog: Where?
8) 25) dialog: Where?  Are they out in the car?
8) 27) dialog: That was the plan, we meet here.
8) 29) dialog: I swear to god I'm fuckin jinxed.
8) 31) dialog: Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
8) 33) dialog: Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin thing.  Just walked away from it.
8) 35) dialog: I don't buy it.  Me and Joe go back a long time.  I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
8) 37) dialog: For all I know, you're the rat.
8) 39) dialog: Jesus Christ!
9) 3) dialog: He ain't dead.

9) 7) dialog: He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
9) 9) dialog: Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault.  Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me.  And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
9) 11) dialog: So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel?  We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
9) 13) dialog: Joe could help him.  If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him. During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a  C.U. of Mr. White.
9) 15) dialog: Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin me to take him to a hospital.  Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead.  He begged me to do it.  I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
9) 17) dialog: I don't know anybody.
9) 21) dialog: Well, he knows a little about me.
9) 23) dialog: I told him my first name, and where I'm from. There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink, then he SCREAMS:
9) 25) dialog: I told him where I was from a few days ago.  It was just a casual conversation.
9) 27) dialog: He asked. Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.
9) 28) dialog: We had just gotten away from the cops.  He just got shot.  It was my fuckin fault he got shot.  He's a fuckin bloody mess - he's screaming.  I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there.  I'm tryin to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him.  And he asked me what my name was.  I mean, the man was dyin in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules.  I don't trust you enough."?  Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
9) 30) dialog: Don't fuckin patronize me.
9) 32) dialog: Of course.
9) 34) dialog: If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round. Mr. Pink walks out of the C.U. and turns his back on Mr. White.  Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.
9) 36) dialog: If we don't, he'll die.
9) 38) dialog: That fuckin did it! Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink. Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in the mouth.
9) 39) text: Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and realistic fight.  They go at each other like a couple of alley cats. As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:
9) 40) dialog: You little motherfucker! Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:
9) 42) dialog: You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit?  Take a shot!
10) 9) dialog: Enough!  You better start talkin to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about.  We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin bag on our hip. Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves towards them.
10) 11) dialog: We think we got a rat in the house.
10) 14) dialog: Is that supposed to be funny?
10) 16) dialog: This place just ain't secure anymore.  We're leaving, and you should go with us.

10) 19) text: Piss on this turd, we're outta here. Mr. White turns to leave.
10) 21) dialog: Fuck you, maniac!  It's your fuckin fault we're in so much trouble. Mr. Blonde calmly sits down.  He looks to Mr. Pink.

10) 38) dialog: (to Mr. Pink)
10) 41) dialog: You takin his side?
10) 44) text: And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level.  So let's figure out who's the bad guy. Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away. Mr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning talking about Madonna.
10) 48) dialog: Follow you where?
10) 50) dialog: Why?
11) 0) text: Three cars are parked out front.  Mr. Blonde is walking towards the car he drove.  Mr. White and Mr. Pink are walking behind.  The Camera is HANDHELD following behind them.

39) 3) dialog: When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass.  They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever.  If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose.  Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin shit after that.  You might get some bitch talk shit to ya.  But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next.  Watch her shut the fuck up.  Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around.  So if one's givin you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy.  So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a- bitch in two.  If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers.  The little one.  Then you tell 'im his thumb's next.  After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear.
