6) 114) dialog: What do you think? 'If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them stray, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the mountains, and go in search of the one that has strayed? And if he happen to find it, amen I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety- nine that did not go astray. Even so, it is not the will of your Father in Heaven that a single one of these little ones should perish.'... Ok that's very nce but...

12) 25) dialog: Don't go to any trouble. We believe you... We believe you.
12) 34) dialog: Be careful.
12) 42) dialog: I'm surprised at you Tone. I mean you've had the place for over a year now. Nothing different...same old place...ordinary...flat...no imagination.

16) 14) dialog: 
17) 3) dialog: You'd better make a move kid. He thinks you're trying to screw him.
17) 7) dialog: Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble. You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
17) 14) dialog: You couldn't handle shit. You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand? Hold onto your pay- check this week.
17) 19) dialog: What do you mean?
17) 23) dialog: You sick or what? You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
17) 27) dialog: You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
17) 31) dialog: I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid. Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?

23) 32) dialog: Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.
23) 37) dialog: Maybe, who knows.
23) 42) dialog: Nobody knows anything, believe me.
23) 48) dialog: See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
23) 52) dialog: You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
23) 57) dialog: Don't ask.
23) 65) dialog: Did you?
23) 69) dialog: CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable. The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared. Not half as much as we were though.
23) 73) dialog: You missed the point. The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation. He thinks he's in good standing.
23) 77) dialog: Not sick...just stupid. Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
23) 83) dialog: Don't worry.

24) 23) dialog: ...pluck it out and cast it from thee." "Woe to the man through whom scandal does come." I'm sure you'd agree this is no time to get tied down. Like the priesthood...
24) 28) dialog: ...they don't get tied down do they? "Have I not a right to do what I chose? Even so the last shall be first and the...
24) 33) dialog: ...first last. For many are called but few are chosen."
25) 6) dialog: Ok, how's everything going?
25) 14) dialog: No.
25) 18) dialog: 
25) 27) dialog: That bad, huh?
25) 31) dialog: Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
25) 35) dialog: He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
25) 42) dialog: I don't understand, where's Groppi?
25) 46) dialog: My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
27) 9) dialog: (to repair man) Is my uncle back there?
27) 14) dialog: Thanks!
29) 3) dialog: Marie, are there Columbian coffee beans in this coffee?
29) 7) dialog: Just a second. Let me taste it.
29) 10) dialog: Yes, I'd say there are some Columbian coffee beans in this coffee, but only about 39%.
29) 16) dialog: You see. You probably don't notice this Marie, but Colombian coffee beans are rich coffee beans. Bursting with that good, deep coffee flavor. Picked when they are ripe to the point of perfection. The beans of course, are protected by the tall South American Guama trees.
29) 19) dialog: Then the bean pickers come down and pick each bean by hand. Bean by bean, all heavy with flavor. And they load them into boxes, one box at a time, box by box.
29) 24) dialog: 
30) 3) dialog: Uncle, how are you feeling?
30) 7) dialog: 
30) 13) dialog: 
30) 21) dialog: About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it. He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
30) 28) dialog: Yes...I understand...I'll be careful.
31) 5) dialog: No...we can come back in a couple of weeks. Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
31) 10) dialog: Bore.
31) 14) dialog: Yeah...but don't worry about that now. The Hemmingway one is first.
31) 18) dialog: Take your time. I don't care.
31) 22) dialog: That's the word...preoccupied.
31) 28) dialog: Let's go back inside.
31) 33) dialog: See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
31) 37) dialog: No. Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
31) 40) dialog: That W.A.S.P. bastard.
31) 44) dialog: Watch your language.
32) 8) dialog: Uhuh...probably a good idea. Why don't you do it this time?
32) 15) dialog: Well you can't blame them in a way.
32) 19) dialog: I know...I know.
34) 6) dialog: ...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time. I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
34) 10) dialog: Of all people. Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara. C'mon.
34) 15) dialog: You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
36) 8) dialog: I...I'm selling encyclopedias...er a magazines...newspapers...I'm conducting a survey...I...
37) 6) dialog: Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
37) 10) dialog: Know where he is?

40) 15) dialog: We'll settle it tonight.
40) 20) dialog: Firecrackers! No...no.
40) 24) dialog: Sure, see that guy over there...
