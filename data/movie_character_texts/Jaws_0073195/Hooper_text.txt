23) 67) dialog: Just cast off in turn and make for  the channel, OK?
23) 69) text: Brody starts back towards the shore, Hooper is by his sid
23) 70) dialog: Excuse me, I wonder if you could  tell me...
23) 72) dialog: (noticing something) Is that dynamite?
23) 77) text: The man passes Brody a cigar box filled with dynamite sti Brody tucks the dynamite under his arm, and continues dow the pier. Hooper is still with him. All around them are two distinctly different breeds; the  quiet pros, like Ben Gardner, in well-worn, comfortable  clothes, with efficient, sensible gear, and the amateur  crazies, with all manner of weapons and impractical, sill tourist clothing.
24) 1) dialog: There's a fantail launch out there  that won't make it beyond the  breakwater.
24) 3) dialog: Officer, I wonder if you could tell  me where I could find Chief Brody?
24) 5) dialog: Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the  Oceanographic Institute. (holds out his hand)
25) 0) text: The Amity Morgue is also the Amity Funeral Home, a Victor house that normally serves as the community's mortuary. T Coroner, a professional small-town GP, is standing by as  Hooper is speaking into a sophisticated cassette recorder with a headpiece that leaves his hands free for measureme with a calibrator or calipers.
25) 3) dialog: He is looking down as the drawer slides past him, still m of-fact, turning on his recorder.
25) 4) dialog: Victim One, identified as Christine  Watkins, female Caucasian...
25) 5) text: The sheet has just been lifted, and Hooper stares down at the lump on the slab. He stops, turns off his recorder as emotions wage war with his senses. Rationality wins, and turns on the recorder again.
25) 6) dialog: ...height and weight may only be  estimated from partial remains. Torso  severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated  with no major organs remaining. May  I have a drink of water? Right arm  severed above the elbow with massive  tissue loss from upper musculature.  Portions of denuded bone remaining. (tense, to Brody) -- did you notify the coast guard?
25) 8) dialog: Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum  and portions of ribcage intact. (to Brody) Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions.  Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy  feeding pattern of large squali,  possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or  isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss  and post-mortem erosion of bite  surfaces prevent detailed analysis;  however, teeth and jaws of the  attacking squali must be considered  above average for these waters. (to Brody again) -- Did you go out in a boat and look  around?
25) 10) dialog: (turns off the recorder) It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a  boat propeller, or a coral reef, or  Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It  was a shark.
26) 2) text: As he and the photographer turn to mob, we see Hooper and Brody arriving from the morgue. Hooper immediately heads  towards the shark, while Brody pauses and we see a look o relief and delight cross his features.
26) 3) dialog: Well, if one man can catch a fish in  50 days, then I guess 50 of these  bozos can catch a fish in one day --  beginner's luck.
26) 7) text: He continues to call directions and move people out of th way to set up his shot. Hooper is measuring the shark.
26) 9) dialog: Who, me? Okay... (he drifts off)
26) 16) dialog: It's a tiger shark. Very rare in  these waters, and definitely a  maneater.
26) 17) text: Hooper enters the circle, and picks up where he left off, measuring the shark's teeth. Others watch him. Charlie an Denherder walk over to the shark. Charlie punches it.
26) 22) text: Brody and Vaughn are by now near the circle of fishermen, who are surrounding Hooper, raising their voices at him.
26) 25) dialog: I didn't say this wasn't the shark,  I just said I wasn't sure this was  the one...
26) 27) dialog: There are hundreds of different kinds  of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads,  white-tips... any one of them could've  attacked. Look -- shark digestion is  slow. We could open this one up, and  find whatever he's been eating is  still inside.
26) 29) dialog: Let's just cut him open and see what's  inside...
26) 33) dialog: Wait a minute...
26) 44) dialog: Look, maybe this is the wrong time  to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
26) 45) text: Before Hooper can finish, Brody's shoulders slump and he  goes slack.
26) 49) text: He turns and leaves abruptly, surrendering the dock to Va and Hooper, who eye each other with mutual dis-admiration
27) 5) dialog: Martin Brody residence?
27) 7) dialog: Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband  is here, I'd like to talk to him.
27) 9) text: Hooper enters. He's carrying a couple of bottles of wine  which he picked up in town. He sits down near Brody.
27) 11) dialog: (seeing Brody's plate) Is anyone having this...?
27) 13) dialog: Dynamite! (to Brody) How was your day...?
27) 16) dialog: (producing wine) Here... one red, one white.
27) 18) dialog: (boning his fish) Ummm. Really good.
27) 21) dialog: I wouldn't put it that way. But I  love sharks.
27) 23) dialog: I do. (he tells a story  about his boyhood  and a shark) But you've still got a problem here,  there's a shark just off the island  somewhere.
27) 26) dialog: They caught a shark, not the shark.  Big difference. I could've proved it  this afternoon, by cutting that one  open and examining his stomach  contents. Also, his bite was too  small.
27) 28) dialog: I was lucky to find that in town --  it's an estate bottled vintage year...
27) 30) dialog: (as Brody pours) We ought to let it breathe...  Whatever.
27) 32) text: He extends the bottle to Hooper, who politely accepts a t sip. He takes some for himself, and offers some to Ellen.
27) 35) dialog: (toasting) Here's to your husband, the only  other rational man on the island.  Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone,  and he'll be the only one.
27) 37) dialog: Going out on the 'Aurora.'
27) 39) dialog: Is it! The best-funded research  expedition to ever study the shark...  around the world in 18 months.
27) 41) dialog: Better than Cousteau, or Compagno  with computers, telemetry, Defense  Department funding...
27) 43) dialog: Yep.
27) 46) dialog: Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark  they caught...
27) 48) dialog: About half of them. A lot of 'missing  swimmers' are really shark victims.
27) 50) dialog: Rogue?
27) 52) dialog: It's called Territoriality. It's a  theory.
27) 54) dialog: You could say that.
27) 59) dialog: I'm flattered you should ask.
28) 0) text: Dark, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and strange  silhouettes of boat parts and scaffolding. At one end, th large, symmetrical bulk of the shark's carcass lies on a  tarp. A single dark figure is bending over the dead shark The large double doors at one end of the shed squeak open and the Shadowy Figure moves abruptly away from the shark The new entrants move into the shed. It is Hooper and Bro and they are continuing the conversation begun in the car the way over. As the Shadowy Figure moves silently into a vantage point against one wall, he passes through the light from a wind it is Quint, and we only see him long enough to recognize him as he backs against the wall.
28) 1) dialog: ...And it was Dartmouth Winter  weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen,  and I was her date; then she got  into the fact that her family had  more money than my family, and she  was right -- her great-grandfather  was in mining, and my ancestors were  Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up  and I went home with some beatnik  from Sarah Lawrence.
28) 3) dialog: Our friend, the shark.
28) 5) dialog: We always had a summer place on the  water -- Newport, the Vineyard, so I  figured I'd major in something I  knew about. Oceanography, marine  biology. It was that, or design racing  yachts like my older brother. Hmmm.  He we go. Up the old alimentary canal.  Hold the light.
28) 6) text: We hear a slurp and a squish as Hooper produces a big kni and dips into the shark with a major incision.
28) 7) dialog: We open the abdominal cavity and  check the digestive tract. Simple. (he attends to his  work)
28) 10) dialog: Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap  bag... a paint can... aha!
28) 12) dialog: Just as I thought. He drifted up  here with the Gulf Stream, from  southern waters.
28) 14) dialog: (showing it) Florida license plate.
28) 16) dialog: (laughs) No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage  cans of the ocean. They eat anything.  But this one didn't eat any people.  There's nothing here...
28) 18) dialog: ...Nothing.
28) 20) dialog: If you're looking for a shark, you  don't look on land. You go out and  chum for him.
28) 22) dialog: Only one sure way to find him --  offer him a little something to eat.  Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish,  anything. They can sense it miles  away. If he's out there, we might be  able to get a closer look at him. (checks his watch) It's a good time, too. They're night  feeders...
29) 0) text: We see Brody, looking sick and nervous, holding on anxiou as the "Fascinatin' Rhythm" moves slowly ahead trolling a night. His glasses are already flecked with the white sal of dried seawater. He is wearing a life-preserver. Hooper is at the wheel, a chart spread in front of him, h eyes scanning the sea restlessly, checking the dials and  gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depth-fi and "fish-finder" gear mounted in the cockpit. A green gl shines from the instruments on his face. Two closed-circu TV cameras mounted below the hull flash their pictures on monitors in the dash. In the aisle between the seats is a large container fille with unpleasant-looking bait; Hooper is long-lining for s of shark, and chumming.
29) 1) dialog: (indicating distant  flashing beacon) That's the Cape Light -- we're on  the stretch where he's feeding, if  he's still here.
29) 4) dialog: (ticking them off) Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar,  closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft --  RDF, single side band... (points to themselves) And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
29) 6) dialog: Sometimes. (indicates display) Look here -- something big, probably  a school of mackerel clumped together.  And staying right with us.
29) 10) dialog: I Bought it.  Both sets of  grandparents set up trust funds for  me; stocks went up, so I don't have  to touch my principal.
29) 12) dialog: (a nerve has been  touched) It is a job. I'm not fooling around  like some amateur. It's my life!
29) 17) text: Hooper looks up and cuts the wheel hard, as the same time dropping the engines into neutral, and then reverse. The  sudden change throws Brody to his knees.
29) 22) text: Hooper cuts his engines and drifts in; he scampers out to the bow of his boat and makes a line fast to the Flicka.
29) 28) dialog: I want to check something. Hold my  feet.
29) 31) dialog: (surfacing) They must've hit something.
29) 34) dialog: He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm  going down to take a look at his  hull.
29) 36) dialog: (hyperventilating) We will. There's something I've got  to find out.
29) 38) text: Hooper takes a last few breaths, orients himself, takes a long, hard look at the quiet, open ocean, and falls into sea.
29) 41) text: Hooper descends in a froth of bubbles. Warily he turns a  full circle with his hotlight. At first we see nothing ou of place about the Flicka except that it is lying so low the water. But as Hooper travels the bottom looking for  damage, he comes across a jagged hole two-thirds of the w forward. The hole is about the size of a basketball, and the wood  around it has been bashed and splintered. Hooper explores the hole with his hands, then takes the knife from its sh and begins to dig at something. Whatever it is comes free his hand. As he studies his find, his light wanders upwar pointing directly into the dark hole. Hooper looks up...
29) 43) dialog: bumps his head in trying to get away, seems to yell throu escaping bubbles. We hear the gasping shout as a bubbling roar in the ears. His mask fills with water as he flails the surface. Miscalculating, he bumps into the hull of hi own boat, shocked, dismayed, his system jangling with  adrenaline shock, his hands open, and the object he pried loose from the hull drifts down and out, falling into the eternity of the ocean bottom. He finally bursts through t surface.
29) 47) dialog: A White! A Great White, I found a  tooth buried in the hull. He must've  attacked... I knew it... Gardner's  dead in there. I didn't see the  mate...
29) 49) text: Hooper, despite his shock and surprise, is strangely elat almost giddy with the wonder of his discovery.
29) 50) dialog: Jesus Christ! A Great White! Who'd  believe it! We're not talking about  a shark, we're talking about a Shark!
29) 51) text: Brody sinks weakly into a chair. Brody huddles in the ste Hooper kicks the engine in with a roar, and still a-shive with excitement, turns the boat and its grim tow back to  port.

Brody's wagon is ther along with a few other cars. Busy late afternoon traffic starting to pile up as early weekenders and curiosity see slow down to see what's happening. Behind the billboard, Brody and Hooper have gotten Vaughn one side. They are making a closely reasoned presentation him.
30) 2) dialog: You're situation here suggests that  a Great White has staked out a claim  in the waters around Amity Island,  and that he will continue to feed  here as long as there is food in the  water.
30) 4) dialog: A shark's attack is stimulated by  the kind of splashing and activity  that occurs whenever humans go  swimming -- you can't avoid it!
30) 6) dialog: I just pulled a shark tooth the size  of a shot glass out of the hull of a  wrecked boat out there.
30) 12) dialog: Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
30) 16) dialog: I'm familiar with the fact that you  are going to ignore this thing until  it swims up and bites you on the  ass! There are only two ways to solve  this thing: you can kill it, or you  can cut off its food supply...
30) 21) dialog: (who has followed  them around) That's it! I'm standing here arguing  with a guy who can't wait to be a  hot lunch. Goodbye.

The next two min should be treated like a "short film" taking into account all of the colors, episodes, faces and behavior of a vari of Americans who colonize Eastern resort communities for ninety-day season. Intercut with this montage is Brody's home, where Ellen,  Hooper and Brody are in sweaty, gritty all-out effort to  enlist some support. Elements in this montage include: A.  A train of cars trundling down the ramp, bumper to bu B.

Brody: "All I get is a recording. Is there some other number I could try...?" J.  Station wagons with pale winter faces pressed anxious to the window. Cadillacs with Rear Admirals at the helm,  their wives with blue hair remembering the way from years before. K.  Hooper: "When did he check out? Did he leave another  phone number?" L.  Brody: "How can I reach him in Chambers if he's not i Chambers?" M.  Little Karate Hands breaking picket fences. N.

They scour the landing, looking for someone to save. The boat is empty. Everybody heading inland, anticipating the best Fourth of July ever.

Brody addresses his troops, such as they are.
