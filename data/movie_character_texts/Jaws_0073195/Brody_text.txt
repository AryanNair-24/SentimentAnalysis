27) 45) dialog: Drowning. Lemme ask you something.  Is it true most attacks take place  in three feet of water, around 10  feet from the beach?
27) 47) dialog: Something else. Do most attacks go  unreported?
27) 49) dialog: There's a kind of a lone shark,  called, uh...
27) 51) dialog: Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where  there's food and hangs out there as  long as the food supply lasts?
27) 53) dialog: And before 1900, when people first  starting swimming for recreation,  before public bathing and resorts,  there were very few shark attacks,  cause sharks didn't know what they  were missing?
27) 55) text: Brody digests all this; confirmation of facts he has glea in his newly acquired knowledge of the shark species. There is a long pause.

His glasses are already flecked with the white sal of dried seawater. He is wearing a life-preserver. Hooper is at the wheel, a chart spread in front of him, h eyes scanning the sea restlessly, checking the dials and  gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depth-fi and "fish-finder" gear mounted in the cockpit. A green gl shines from the instruments on his face. Two closed-circu TV cameras mounted below the hull flash their pictures on monitors in the dash. In the aisle between the seats is a large container fille with unpleasant-looking bait; Hooper is long-lining for s of shark, and chumming.

29) 16) dialog: Hey!
29) 17) text: Hooper looks up and cuts the wheel hard, as the same time dropping the engines into neutral, and then reverse. The  sudden change throws Brody to his knees.

29) 21) dialog: That's Ben Gardner's boat! It's the  Flicka! Ben? Ben!
29) 27) dialog: What happened?

29) 35) dialog: Why don't we just tow it in?
29) 37) dialog: Be careful, for chrissake.
29) 39) dialog: He is studying the surface, trying to follow Hooper's  movements. Brody is forcing himself to stay at the edge o the boat by sheer willpower and grim determination. Brody fascinated by the sea like a bird facing a cobra. He is v much alone. He grasps a flashlight or boathook as a fragi defense against the unknown.
29) 46) dialog: You all right?
29) 48) dialog: No shark did that to a boat!

Behind the billboard, Brody and Hooper have gotten Vaughn one side. They are making a closely reasoned presentation him.

30) 3) dialog: There's no limits to where he can  strike, and we've had three attacks  and two deaths in the past few days.  It happened like this before, in  1916, when a Great White killed five  swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long  Island.
30) 5) dialog: A 4th of July beach is like ringing  a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
30) 7) dialog: We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry;  he was dead and his boat was all  chewed up.
30) 14) dialog: We have got to close the beaches. We  have got to get someone to kill the  shark, we need non-corrosive mesh  netting, we need scientific support...  It's gonna cost money just to keep  the nuts out and save what we have.
30) 17) dialog: That means closing the beaches.
30) 19) text: He leads Brody around to the front of the billboard, on w we see that some pranksters have painted a huge shark fin the water behind the swimmer, so she looks now like a fra bather fleeing a pursuing monster.
