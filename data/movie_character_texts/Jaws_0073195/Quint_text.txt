He's a bad one  and it's not like goin' down the  pond chasing blue-gills and tommy- cods. This is a fish that can swallow  a man whole. A little shakin', a  little tenderizing and down ya' go. (a look to Vaughn) You gotta get this fellow and get  him quick. If you do, it'll bring a  lot of tourist business just to see  him and you've got your business  back on a paying basis. (beat) A shark of that size is no pleasure  and I value my neck at a hell of a  lot more'n 3,000 bucks. (a deadly look) I'll find him for three. But I'll  kill him for ten.
21) 26) dialog: (he rises up) The bastard is costing you more'n  that every day. Do you wanna stay  alive and annee up the ten or play  it cheap and be on welfare next  winter. (a final moment) I'm gonna kill this thing... just a  matter of whether I do it now -- or  at the end of summer.

39) 13) dialog: Hello, Junior. What are you? Some  kind of half-assed astronaut? (to himself) Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every  little squirt wanted to be a harpooner  or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have  there -- a portable shower?
39) 15) dialog: Who's inside, you or the shark?
39) 17) dialog: You're in the cage? (Hooper nods) The cage is in the water? (Hooper nods) The shark is in the water too? (Hooper nods) You're in the water with the shark.

39) 41) dialog: Now hear this. You're aboard the  fishing vessel 'Orca,' and I'm her  Captain, Master, Mate, and Owner.  You'll jump when I holler. We're  doin' a job here, and Christ, I ain't  got time to watch you birds get hooks  in your ass and fall overboard. Ship  with me, and you'll do all right.  Cross me, and I'll slap you upside  your heads. Now -- if you boys are  ready -- let's go fishin'.

A couple of flag buoys sp along our perspective show us the miles the boat has gone Quint spots something in the water -- a small blue shark  attracted by the chum. He rigs a small pole with a piece bait, and throws it over the side.
40) 1) dialog: Here's something for you...

41) 6) text: Quint opens a can of beer and drains it in one long pull, crushing the empty and throwing it over the side. Hooper  drains his coffee from a styrofoam cup, and cracks it in hand with a silly "plup." He stows the pieces in an empty chum barrel.

41) 10) dialog: (mutters) Real fine stuff but it won't mean a  thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he  didn't go to schools in electronics.  He was born with what he does best.  Eat.

41) 39) dialog: Gettin' ready to run again -- no?  No? (suspicious) What's he playin' here? (reels in furiously,  to Brody) Put the gloves on! (to fish) Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
41) 41) dialog: (to Hooper) Down here, Hooper!
41) 44) dialog: (bathed in sweat;  hauling, reeling) Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in  the lab, but out here you're just  supercargo, and you'll do as I say,  or you can take your gear and  backstroke home. Now get down here!
41) 47) dialog: (to Brody) Unbuckle me -- fast! (to Hooper) Grab the leader. He ain't normal,  this one... they never --
41) 50) dialog: Watch your hands -- (suddenly to Brody) Grab onto this!
41) 51) text: Before he realizes what's happening, Brody is clumsily  clutching at the big rod, appalled. Quint skips away for flying gaff. He picks one, turns...

The wires have been bitten through.
41) 52) dialog: (to Hooper) A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't  ever tell me my business again. Get  back up on the bridge.

41) 57) text: Hooper shakes off his dizziness and obeys. Brody watches  Quint rig up a new leader, hook up the same bait.
41) 59) dialog: What I do is trick him to the surface,  got that? Then I can jab him,  understand? (goes to flybridge,  muttering) Think I'm gonna haul it in as if  he's a catfish, like everyone else  does?
41) 62) dialog: (suddenly, pointing) Over there!
41) 64) dialog: (still looking) At least you handle the boat all  right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.

41) 98) dialog: Here. Rig this to the forward keg up  there.
41) 100) dialog: (to Brody) Get up there and steer her. Follow  my hand, and hold 'er steady. I've  got to get a clean shot at that  porker's head.
41) 101) text: Quint moves up toward the bow, Brody goes up to the flyin bridge to take the wheel, Hooper starts for the foredeck, but stops to rummage in his kit, throwing gear around as desperately hunts for something.
41) 102) dialog: Hurry up, rig the line!
41) 104) dialog: (to Brody) Come to port. Watch my hand. Steady  now...
41) 105) text: He guides Brody with hand signals. Brody tries urgently t get it right, not to oversteer, to try to hold the big bo with its throbbing diesels on the course that Quint is  indicating.
41) 106) dialog: The line, man, the line!
41) 109) dialog: Agonizing over his shot as the shark approaches, glancing back to see if the line is properly rigged and Hooper is  clear of it.
41) 110) dialog: Get clear, damn you!
41) 113) text: Quint fires. The harpoon slams into the shark behind his  head, half-way along the back in front of the big dorsal  fin.
41) 114) dialog: Jesus H. Christ On a Crutch!
41) 117) dialog: Now you've done it, you piss-ant.  Stop and rig a goddam tinker toy to  my gear. Let the bastard fight the  keg for a while. He can't stay down  with that on.
41) 126) dialog: We got a barrel on him. We can't  lose him. We stay out here until we  find him.

43) 2) text: He corrects course slightly to keep the barrel buoy in si Hooper is sitting at the table, morose. Brody is staring a couple of open cans of beans or beef stew, or some othe crappy rations Quint has on board. Dirty spoons stuck in open cans show us this has not been a formal dinner. Quin fumbles on the chart shelf and produces some of his home  brew. He takes a pull, and hands it to Hooper, who takes a doub Brody touches the fresh abrasion on his forehead, where t fishing rod caught him. Quint bends forward and pulls his hair aside to show some near the crown.
43) 3) dialog: That's not so bad. Look at this:  ...St. Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans,  in Boston, where some sunovabitch  winged me upside the head with a  spittoon.

43) 10) dialog: Face and head scars come from amateur  amusements in the bar room. This  love line here... (he bends an ear  forward) ...that's from some crazy Frenchie  come after me with a knife. I caught  him with a good right hand right in  the snot locker and laid him amongst  the sweetpeas.
43) 14) dialog: Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
43) 16) dialog: Slammed with a thresher's tail. Look  just like somebody caressed me with  a nutmeg grater...
43) 19) dialog: And I'll drink to yours.
43) 21) dialog: Wait a minute, young fella. Look.  Just look. Don't touch...
43) 23) dialog: ...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope  and onto the deck. You don't get  bitten by one of those bastards but  twice -- your first and your last.
43) 30) dialog: And here's to the ladies. And here's  to their sisters; I'd rather one  Miss than a shipload of Misters.

43) 37) dialog: (changing) Tattoo. Had it taken off.
43) 39) dialog: 'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
43) 42) text: Quint remembering.
43) 43) dialog: 
43) 44) dialog: Yeah. The U.S.S. Indianapolis. June 29th, 1945, three and a half  minutes past midnight, two torpedoes  from a Japanese submarine slammed  into our side. Two or three. We was  still under sealed orders after  deliverin' the bomb...the Hiroshima  bomb...we was goin' back across the  Pacific from Tinian to Leyte. Damn  near eleven hundred men went over  the side. The life boats was lashed  down so tight to make the bomb run  we couldn't cut a single one adrift.  Not one. And there was no rafts.  None. That vessel sank in twelve  minutes. Yes, that's all she took.  We didn't see the first shark till  we'd been in the water about an hour.  A thirteen-footer near enough. A  blue. You measure that by judgin'  the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't  know... of course the Captain knew...I  guess some officers knew... was the  bomb mission had been so secret, no  distress signals was sent. What the  men didn't know was that they wouldn't  even list us as overdue for a week.  Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't  an officer -- just as well perhaps.  So some of us were dead already --  in the water -- just hangin' limp in  our lifejackets. And several already  bleedin'. And the three hundred or  so laying on the bottom of the ocean.  As the light went, the sharks came  crusin'. We formed tight groups --  somewhat like squares in an old battle --  You know what I mean -- so that when  one come close, the man nearest would  yell and shout and pound the water  and sometimes it worked and the fish  turned away, but other times that  shark would seem to look right at a  man -- right into his eyes -- and in  spite of all shoutin' and poundin'  you'd hear that terrible high  screamin' and the ocean would go  red, then churn up as they ripped  him.  Then we'd reform our little  squares. By the first dawn the sharks  had taken more than a hundred. Hard  for me to count but more than a  hundred. I don't know how many sharks.  Maybe a thousand. I do know they  averaged six men an hour. All kinds --  blues, makos, tigers. All kinds. (Pause) In the middle of the second day,  some of us started to go crazy from  the thirst. One fella cried out he  saw a river, another claimed he saw  a waterfall, some started to drink  the ocean and choked on it, and some  left our little groups -- our little  squares -- and swam off alone lookin'  for islands and the sharks always  took them right away. It was mainly  the young fellas that did that --  the older ones stayed where they  was. That second day -- my life jacket  rubbed me raw and that was more blood  in the water. Oh my. On Thursday  morning I bumped up against a friend  of mine -- Herbie Robinson from  Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it  seemed he was asleep but when I  reached over to waken him, he bobbed  in the water and I saw his body upend  because he'd been bitten in half  beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it  went on -- bombers high overhead but  nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides,  sharks, and all this goin' crazy and  dyin' of thirst. Noon the fifth day,  Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura swung  around and came in low. Yes. He did  that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And  early evenin', a big fat PBY come  down out of the sky and began the  pickup.  That was when I was most  frightened of all -- while I was  waitin' for my turn. Just two and a  half hours short of five days and  five nights when they got to me and  took me up. Eleven hundred of us  went into that ocean -- three hundred  and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen  hundred and forty five. June the  29th. (pause) Anyway, we delivered the bomb.
44) 0) text: Quint has just finished his story, and we are looking acr the quiet night sea to the Orca slowly circling in the ni the warm light in the pilot house barely revealing the fi of the three men inside, the red and green running lights winking along the ship's flanks.

45) 3) text: There's a brief, eerie pause. Quint breaks the silence by muttering into song, which he slowly swells.
45) 4) dialog: (singing) Show me the way to go home... I'm  tired and I want to go to bed. I had  a little drink about an hour ago,  and it went right to my head. (etc.)
47) 0) text: The song is continuing, and we hear the barest hint of a  scraping sound from the hull deep beneath the men. Quint' eyes abruptly narrow as his sensitive ears are the first hear the abrasion of his ship. Things vibrate on the shel Quint stops singing, Hooper and Brody continue a duet. Th scraping repeats, and Hooper now senses it. He drops out the song, leaving Brody singing solo.
47) 1) dialog: (quietly, to Hooper) Start the engines.
47) 2) text: As Brody hears this and is about to stop singing, the boa is suddenly bumped from below, and the gentle scraping tu to a violent assault somewhere on the understructure of t vessel.
