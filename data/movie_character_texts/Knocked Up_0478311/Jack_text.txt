9) 0) text: Allison's boss, JACK, early forties, is at his desk. Alis Jill sit in the office.
9) 1) dialog: Thanks for coming in, Alison. Well, we wanted to talk to you today because we had a little debate on the conference call with New York about you.
9) 3) dialog: We were wondering aloud to one another whether or not you would be good for on-camera.
9) 10) dialog: Congratulations.
9) 12) dialog: I'll take that smile as a "Yes, I'll do it."
9) 15) dialog: About the work, most immediately, there's going to be some things that you're going to be able to get that other people in the office don't get. One of them: Gym membership.
9) 17) dialog: I don't want you to lose weight.
9) 19) dialog: We didn't say lose weight.
9) 21) dialog: I might say "tighten."
9) 23) dialog: A little...tighter?
9) 25) dialog: Don't make everything smaller. I don't want to generalize that way. Tighter.
9) 32) dialog: Just remember, you've got it here, you've got it here, and everybody's going see you right there.
123) 0) text: Alison, Jill and Jack are in the office.
123) 1) dialog: Alison, thank you for coming in. I don't want to shock you, but know what's under that jacket. You're pregnant, have been for a while. From my count, you're right around eight months. And I don't know why you felt you couldn't tell us.
123) 5) dialog: It's unfortunate that you didn't tell us because you would've found out that we thought it's great. KNOCKED UP - 115.
123) 9) dialog: So, we did some research. And turns out, people like pregnant.
123) 11) dialog: The bigger you are, the bigger your numbers.
123) 13) dialog: We're going to do a whole maternity month on "E, Exclamation, Mommy." You're going to interview all the pregnant celebs.
123) 15) dialog: Yes.
123) 17) dialog: If you're pregnant, they're pregnant, you can talk about being pregnant.
123) 19) dialog: And everything that goes into it. None of the gross stuff. But you know, hopes, dreams, whatever. It's going to be great.
123) 21) dialog: You're welcome. And then, after the baby is out, tighten it back up.
