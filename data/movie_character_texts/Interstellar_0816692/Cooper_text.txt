4) 9) dialog: Long way to come by bus. I thought you guys would have a plane.
4) 13) dialog: A little.
4) 27) dialog: 
6) 13) dialog: (shakes his head) Satellite. Big one. Probably Chinese.
7) 5) dialog: You ruin it for the boys when you talk like that.
7) 9) dialog: They didn't have any baseball at all when I was a kid.
8) 7) dialog: I thought okra wasn't susceptible.
8) 12) dialog: Something wrong with your truck?
8) 20) dialog: What does that have to do with anything?
10) 3) dialog: Get the spare, Tom.
10) 7) dialog: All right. We'll use the patch kit.
10) 13) dialog: Murph's law.
10) 25) dialog: Find something to patch it with.
10) 29) dialog: Figure it out. I'm not always going to be here to help you.
10) 34) dialog: Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't mean that. It means what can happen will happen. All kinds of things. Good or bad. And that's the way you want it to be.
10) 38) dialog: Because if nothing ever happened to you then you wouldn't learn anything.
10) 41) dialog: Murph?
10) 46) dialog: Get in.
13) 3) dialog: It's a Chinese military drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm.
13) 7) dialog: Keep it pointed right at it, OK?
13) 10) dialog: Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.
17) 6) dialog: Almost got it. Don't slow down.
18) 6) dialog: 
18) 12) dialog: You want to give it a whirl?
18) 17) dialog: Set her down in the valley -- there, next to the river.
19) 7) dialog: Chinese mission control went down same as us, twenty years ago. It's been up there ever since.
19) 12) dialog: It was looking for something. Intercepted some kind of signal.
19) 19) dialog: Reprogram it. Give it something socially responsible to do like drive a combine or a tractor.
19) 25) dialog: We need all the help we can get, Murph. This thing has to adapt, just like the rest of us.
21) 9) dialog: What about college?
21) 13) dialog: You're ruling out college for him now? He's only fifteen.
21) 17) dialog: What are you, about a 36-inch waist?
21) 22) dialog: You're telling me you need two numbers to measure your own ass, but just one to measure my son's future?
21) 27) dialog: Engineer.
21) 37) dialog: Are we done?
21) 42) dialog: One of my old textbooks. Murph liked the pictures.
21) 46) dialog: Corrected?
21) 50) dialog: You don't believe we went to the moon?
21) 54) dialog: "Useless machines"? 18.
21) 60) dialog: One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI. If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife's brain before she died, rather than afterwards. And then my kids could have been raised by two parents, instead of me and their pain-in-the-ass grandfather.
21) 63) dialog: You ever consider the best thing for the world and humanity might have been for us to part company?
22) 6) dialog: Just tell him to power down the controllers for a couple minutes.
24) 3) dialog: Bravo-two-eight, requesting permission to enter your airspace.
26) 11) dialog: Not exactly.
27) 4) dialog: Space probe. Never seen one like it, though. Looks like it's been to hell and back.
27) 9) dialog: Lost, I guess. Guidance satellites would have been shot down by the Chinese twenty years ago.
28) 4) dialog: Well I don't know what the hell it's made of, but I can't crack it open.
28) 13) dialog: Good boy. Hand me the scanner.
28) 17) dialog: Here we go. Standard NASA encryption. Memory's been damaged. Just noise. Hold on. I've got something.
28) 23) dialog: I don't know.
28) 26) dialog: Where the hell did you come from?
28) 29) dialog: We'll take it down to Tyson's tomorrow and have it melted down. Might be some copper inside.
28) 33) dialog: There's no one for it to report to. NASA is all gone. I'm sorry, son. It got home too late.
29) 6) dialog: Maybe it's better for everyone to forget what they did back then. Reminds us how far we've fallen.
29) 15) dialog: It doesn't bother me that he can't go. It bothers me that he doesn't care.
34) 7) dialog: It's a fail-safe. It's going to annoy us into taking it home.
34) 13) dialog: We're going to get some sleep.
36) 5) dialog: You're staying here and cleaning the house.
36) 8) dialog: I told you, Murph. There's no one to take it back to.
42) 3) dialog: Got any diesel?
44) 7) dialog: I don't know. Don't touch them. 27.
44) 12) dialog: Murph?
45) 6) dialog: Careful. There's some kind of underground facility here. We might...
45) 12) dialog: Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't made them for thirty years. I've never seen one intact before.
45) 16) dialog: I think we need to go, Murph.
45) 20) dialog: No. I don't know what this place is, but we're leaving.
45) 29) dialog: 
45) 36) dialog: We were just looking for salvage.
45) 40) dialog: I didn't know it belonged to anyone.
45) 47) dialog: You've got me wrong, lady.
45) 57) dialog: (points at Tars) Word of advice -- careful with that thing. When the war was over, they didn't know when to stop fighting.
45) 63) dialog: Wait a second--
46) 3) dialog: Now who's stealing from who?
46) 7) dialog: You're right. It belongs to NASA, which shut down thirty years ago when the federal government ran out of money.
47) 4) dialog: Who are you people?
47) 16) dialog: Galveston.
47) 21) dialog: Canaveral's been gone for thirty years.
47) 30) dialog: Nothing. I got something off of it.
47) 33) dialog: 
47) 40) dialog: Most of the disk was noise. Couple of clean sectors, though.
47) 52) dialog: There aren't any planets like that anywhere near earth. Not even if this thing was gone for thirty years.
47) 57) dialog: You can't keep us here. 33.
47) 61) dialog: I'm not going to endanger it any more than you already have.
47) 64) dialog: Are you using that for guidance?
47) 68) dialog: The power supply is no good. If the voltage fluctuates under load, the unit will fail.
47) 72) dialog: Bought thirty of them off a guy in Florida. Had to rebuild every last one.
48) 4) dialog: You plan on keeping us here forever?
48) 14) dialog: I guess no one told them they were out of a job. (nods at Tars) Same as the rest of these people.
49) 3) dialog: I thought the old man was in charge.
49) 8) dialog: Not you?
49) 12) dialog: 
50) 25) dialog: That rocket doesn't have enough thrust or fuel to get you to Jupiter.
50) 30) dialog: Why are you telling me this? I already told you I'm not going to tell anyone about this place.
50) 44) dialog: But I don't have any of the experience. Any training. You people have been preparing for this for years.
50) 51) dialog: No. I'm sorry.
50) 54) dialog: I can't help you. I have responsibilities. Things that, no offense, are more important than a scientific mission.
50) 63) dialog: Rescue? Rescue who?
52) 4) dialog: The blight.
52) 9) dialog: But it doesn't affect the corn.
52) 15) dialog: 
52) 23) dialog: You've known this for how long? And you didn't try to tell anyone?
52) 28) dialog: 
52) 33) dialog: But you'd still only be able to save a few hundred. Maybe a thousand.
56) 9) dialog: I can't go. I have to look after the boys.
56) 13) dialog: I have a responsibility to them--
58) 6) dialog: You have to stay here, pal.
58) 12) dialog: There's going to be important work to do here, too.
58) 15) dialog: I need you to hold onto this. Will you do that for me?
58) 20) dialog: I will come back. I promise. 42.
59) 5) dialog: Don't look so happy to see me.
59) 13) dialog: Great idea. A massive, sarcastic robot.
59) 18) dialog: That sounds like a good idea.
61) 3) dialog: I was wondering where you've been getting your supplies.
61) 11) dialog: So you're a salvage diver now? I thought you were a biologist.
62) 8) dialog: We're taking ants with us?
62) 12) dialog: I thought humans were more solitary.
62) 18) dialog: Looks like hard work.
63) 10) dialog: Is that a star?
63) 32) dialog: Lose time?
63) 42) dialog: How much time?
63) 64) dialog: Sure. Till we ran out of food and ate all of them.
64) 6) dialog: (to Tars, sarcastic) I thought I was going to get to enjoy your company all the way to Mars.
66) 3) dialog: We'll be back.
73) 7) dialog: Oh, no. I want to see this.
73) 11) dialog: 
73) 15) dialog: Bit of a demotion.
74) 3) dialog: The ship is tiny.
78) 6) dialog: I know. So why are you painting it?
78) 11) dialog: Sure it does.
78) 17) dialog: What'd you paint?
80) 7) dialog: How much do these things weigh?
80) 12) dialog: Damn.
80) 19) dialog: Why?
81) 5) dialog: Fine. The anesthetic is working.
81) 9) dialog: 
81) 14) dialog: Why?
81) 18) dialog: If we're such a liability, why take us along? You and Tars could build the colony without us. You wouldn't need to bring food or oxygen.
81) 22) dialog: Humans aren't programmed.
81) 27) dialog: Did they program you to be condescending?
81) 35) dialog: 
81) 40) dialog: How would that make us better at surviving?
81) 47) dialog: No. I want to know.
82) 3) dialog: We've almost reached the wormhole.
83) 6) dialog: I know. Thank you.
83) 10) dialog: You never had any? I thought I was a pariah for only having two.
83) 15) dialog: Strange place to look for a new home.
83) 19) dialog: You really think there's a plan?
83) 23) dialog: I guess I just think we're on our own.
93) 8) dialog: 
95) 3) dialog: Where are we?
95) 13) dialog: Something's happening to the hull over here.
95) 18) dialog: Well, I don't know what your display is telling you but something is happening over here.
95) 47) dialog: Can you ask it to stop?
101) 3) dialog: It's working.
103) 9) dialog: We've lost contact with the relay.
103) 13) dialog: One long garbled transmission came in. Then nothing.
105) 15) dialog: What is he doing?
107) 8) dialog: What about Tars?
111) 4) dialog: I still can't contact the relay.
111) 7) dialog: Did you hear me? We're not able to communicate back home.
111) 20) dialog: How could they all have landed in the same place?
113) 3) dialog: We're bringing him along? 71.
120) 7) dialog: This is the Taichung mission.
120) 12) dialog: They never landed. Not on Mars. Four human crew, fifteen robots. The log says the base has been here for thirty years.
123) 3) dialog: The entire human crew is buried out there in the snow. 75.
123) 16) dialog: Then what?
123) 23) dialog: What about returning to the ship?
124) 4) dialog: What is this?
126) 9) dialog: Case, wait--
128) 7) dialog: Breathe. Trust me.
128) 10) dialog: Your suit is filling with water. I'm not going to be able to hold it much longer. I'm going to let go.
128) 15) dialog: Take a deep breath.
129) 5) dialog: I thought we were supposed to be a collective organism.
129) 11) dialog: Don't mention it.
130) 9) dialog: Looks like we can climb up the mountains back to the ice. We're down to three suits. We'll have to send someone ahead to get a fourth. 81.
131) 3) dialog: Any sign of Brand?
131) 7) dialog: What happens then?
132) 9) dialog: Any sign of big life-forms?
132) 14) dialog: I just think we should get back to the shelter before night falls.
132) 20) dialog: You don't know that. You just have blind faith this place is going to be some kind of Eden.
132) 25) dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
132) 30) dialog: What?
132) 38) dialog: You know how plants don't usually move? Is that a universal rule?
132) 52) dialog: Hello there.
132) 55) dialog: OK. Now we run.
133) 4) dialog: We have to reach the shelter.
136) 3) dialog: This way.
137) 6) dialog: I've got you.
139) 8) dialog: By "cooperate" do you mean let it eat me?
139) 12) dialog: Then why are they killing each other?
139) 20) dialog: (trying to be calm) What is it doing?
139) 24) dialog: I don't want it to incorporate me.
139) 28) dialog: 
139) 36) dialog: They're killing each other.
139) 41) dialog: I'd say they have a long way to go.
139) 53) dialog: But what are they competing for?
140) 6) dialog: Why not?
140) 10) dialog: What difference would that make?
140) 14) dialog: 
140) 19) dialog: (shakes his head) The plan.
140) 24) dialog: I was in Denver during the first year of the famine. I was just a kid. We kept waiting for someone to come help us. People starved to death sitting on the ground, waiting for someone to come.
140) 28) dialog: (looks at her) I only made it because I realized that nobody was coming to save us. We were on our own.
140) 31) dialog: Honestly? After the things I saw... you want to know why I don't believe that someone would be trying to help us? Because I'm not sure we're worth saving.
145) 5) dialog: Looks like they lost.
146) 8) dialog: But why didn't they come?
148) 9) dialog: Testing what?
148) 12) dialog: 
149) 4) dialog: Everything in here is bolted down. (looks at sphere) What do you think this thing does?
149) 10) dialog: I wouldn't turn it on until we can figure out what it does, Roth.
151) 8) dialog: Old military-grade encryption. It's not very robust. (looks at Case) No offense. Hang on.
151) 12) dialog: That should open up most of it.
151) 17) dialog: No one was listening.
151) 47) dialog: How long does this place have?
151) 61) dialog: 
151) 67) dialog: Case, what is that?
151) 72) dialog: No. It's closer than that.
151) 77) dialog: Quick -- hold onto something.
152) 9) dialog: 
153) 3) dialog: They found a way to make gravity.
153) 13) dialog: What does that mean? 99.
153) 18) dialog: But how did the Chinese develop the technology? This would take decades, maybe hundreds of years, to create.
153) 48) dialog: I know this isn't exactly what you trained for. But I think Roth might be right.
155) 6) dialog: Don't make any sudden movements. They can't hurt us if we're unarmed.
155) 32) dialog: Further orders aren't coming. Your government is gone. It ran out of money, same as ours. You're on your own.
155) 37) dialog: 
155) 68) dialog: Come on.
158) 11) dialog: We're too late.
158) 14) dialog: The main thruster fuel supply. We're not going anywhere.
159) 7) dialog: But we need to take the box back to earth.
160) 5) dialog: I'm going to image the operating code and the architecture onto the probe's hard drive. It'll be garbled, but it should give you and me enough to rebuild it when we get back.
161) 7) dialog: Let me take it.
162) 6) dialog: We're going to find out soon enough.
163) 6) dialog: Where's Brand?
163) 9) dialog: Dammit. If I don't make it back, just keep going. (points to probe) Get that thing home.
169) 13) dialog: 
169) 21) dialog: Guess you were right -- too much gravity, or not enough.
170) 6) dialog: Roth.
172) 4) dialog: How is that working?
172) 8) dialog: Good. We've already set the course, skipper. We're going home.
173) 6) dialog: Now I know why we weren't able to hit the relay. It's not interference -- the blue-shift from the black hole is more than we thought it would be.
173) 14) dialog: Nothing.
173) 22) dialog: How much?
173) 31) dialog: Forty seven years.
173) 41) dialog: We could bypass the relay. Send a conventional shortwave signal.
173) 47) dialog: You knew, didn't you? You and Case figured it out when we landed.
173) 52) dialog: Sure you could. You're brilliant. You know everything. 114.
173) 56) dialog: They're not children any more... if they're even still alive.
173) 65) dialog: Yes she did.
173) 68) dialog: That's why you were upset -- your father.
173) 97) dialog: We can't let that happen. We'll lose more time... too much...
173) 103) dialog: We're losing years.
173) 114) dialog: What will happen to it?
173) 119) dialog: 
173) 130) dialog: All of those people back home... none of them will make it.
173) 139) dialog: Case said the Chinese found something else. The location was scrubbed from their records. But I bet he knows it.
173) 146) dialog: Here. Can we reach it?
175) 7) dialog: (points to screen) That? What is it?
181) 3) dialog: Where are we?
190) 4) dialog: Not a single drink on the whole ship. What kind of mission is this?
190) 9) dialog: You really think we're the last humans alive anywhere?
190) 13) dialog: So that's it, then? That's all?
190) 20) dialog: What about the plan? The grand scheme. 125.
190) 24) dialog: I didn't. But you were bringing me round.
190) 27) dialog: What the hell was the point? What did it add up to?
190) 31) dialog: This? You're saying the end result of ten billion years is the atoms from dead stars standing here disagreeing with each other.
192) 12) dialog: This thing is made of... gravity?
192) 27) dialog: Can we communicate with them?
192) 38) dialog: What is that?
194) 5) dialog: There's something out there.
197) 6) dialog: This is what the Chinese were protecting.
198) 5) dialog: Must have taken you a while.
198) 10) dialog: How are they keeping the lights on in this thing?
201) 3) dialog: It's a map?
201) 19) dialog: So why didn't they return? Why didn't they save us?
202) 17) dialog: They weren't interested in the other wormholes because their mission was to return home. That one leads back to Earth. The Earth they were told to return to.
202) 25) dialog: Did they make it?
202) 33) dialog: We're going to find out.
203) 5) dialog: You don't know that.
203) 16) dialog: I made a promise.
206) 3) dialog: You could have taken one of the other ships.
206) 11) dialog: Where are you going to go?
206) 17) dialog: You're going, too?
206) 25) dialog: I'm sorry. I have to find out what happened to my sons. I promised them.
206) 33) dialog: I promise.
208) 8) dialog: The probe...
208) 16) dialog: It's going to work.
208) 20) dialog: That's not what I mean. This is the probe I found in Galveston.
208) 24) dialog: Brand said there'd be some evidence we'd made it. And there was. This. (holds up probe) But only this. Everything will be destroyed except for this.
208) 27) dialog: We have to stop.
208) 32) dialog: You don't need to do this. We won't make it back, but this does. The secrets are already right on it. Maybe someone found it. There's hope.
221) 7) dialog: Dad? You said you'd take us to the game.
221) 16) dialog: (staring at machine) What is it supposed to do, Dad?
221) 22) dialog: (over radio, garbled) This is the crew of the Endurance... Murph... I'm sorry...
223) 4) dialog: Dad... I'm sorry... I made some changes to the machine. I think I did something wrong.
230) 17) dialog: Where am I?
230) 22) dialog: What's coincidence? What is this place?
231) 7) dialog: Where... where are we?
233) 9) dialog: Shoot. 149.
233) 13) dialog: It was last of its kind. Their planet was destroyed.
233) 23) dialog: Because that was the plan.
233) 27) dialog: 
233) 33) dialog: Feel like I should be pulling my weight. 150.
233) 37) dialog: I was hoping to enroll in a course. Try to get myself up to speed on the new systems.
233) 42) dialog: No one's heard anything from Brand?
233) 46) dialog: Am I really going to hurt anybody by going to look for her? I just need a small ship. I made a promise.
237) 6) dialog: Curiosity. New level setting. 100 percent.
237) 10) dialog: Sense of humor. New level setting. 100 percent. Wait.
240) 5) dialog: Where do you want to go first?
