233) 3) dialog: You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. Let's just start off by saying that. It's an incredible and... unexpected honor to have you here with us.
233) 6) dialog: None of us would be here without the efforts of you and the other crewmembers of the Endurance. (smiles, unconvincingly) So I don't want you to take this the wrong way. But there are some questions I've been told to ask.
233) 11) dialog: The rangers who found you reported that you had released a sample of an alien life-form into the wild. Which is, unfortunately, against regulations.
233) 16) dialog: The rangers attempted to isolate the life-form, but it had already spread out of control. It seems to be thriving.
233) 20) dialog: Can you tell me why you... elected to release the life-form back on earth?
233) 25) dialog: Whose plan?
233) 31) dialog: My assistant tells me you've applied for a position with the exploration fleet.
233) 35) dialog: That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The truth is, most of the fleet's personnel are automated. There are a small number of crewed ships. But there are great numbers of candidates. Very well trained candidates.
233) 39) dialog: I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I said, you're a hero. But the truth is we have somewhat limited resources.
233) 44) dialog: I'm sorry. Officially, she's been listed as missing for over 200 years. Mind you, I guess you turned up eventually, didn't you?
233) 49) dialog: Listen. Mr. Cooper. You're a hero. You're the oldest man in the human race. Don't you want to take it easy? (off his look) I hope you understand, we all you hold you in the highest possible regard.
233) 53) dialog: I've got some good news, however.
