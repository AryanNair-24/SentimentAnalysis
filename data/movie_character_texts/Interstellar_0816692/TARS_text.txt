45) 55) dialog: Don't forget your gun.
48) 6) dialog: 
59) 7) dialog: 
59) 15) dialog: I have a cue light I can turn on when I'm joking, if you like.
59) 20) dialog: Great. Maybe you can use it to find your way back to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.
64) 9) dialog: You will. My chassis is too heavy for the rocket stage. They have another one waiting for me in orbit.
64) 12) dialog: If you try to turn me into a combine harvester, I'm going to--
73) 18) dialog: I wouldn't call it that, exactly.
78) 4) dialog: It's the comms relay. It will allow us to talk to earth, even on the far side of the wormhole.
78) 9) dialog: It helps me calibrate my fine motor control.
78) 15) dialog: I learned it during the war.
78) 19) dialog: Tombstones.
80) 5) dialog: Be careful. It's difficult to gauge mass in zero gravity.
80) 9) dialog: Four tons.
93) 6) dialog: Would you like me to make a joke?
196) 4) dialog: 
197) 3) dialog: I orbited the black hole seven times before I hit the second wormhole. Then I drifted until I found this place.
197) 9) dialog: They didn't. It took them four thousand. (off Brand's look) Time moves very slowly here 130.
197) 13) dialog: Because I've been waiting for you for three hundred years.
198) 3) dialog: I have catalogued almost everything they had built here.
198) 7) dialog: One hundred and fifty-seven years.
198) 13) dialog: Follow me.
199) 5) dialog: It's a mini black hole. A remnant of the big bang. It will power this place forever.
201) 5) dialog: No. Not a map. This is a simulation of the Earth. A perfect simulation.
201) 10) dialog: They tested each of the technologies hundreds of times, trying to find the one that would cause the least damage and still allow us to leave Earth.
201) 14) dialog: This was their best solution. A massive version of the box we found on the ice planet, allowing the entire human population to escape.
201) 25) dialog: That was the final problem they tried to solve.
202) 7) dialog: There are millions of them, connecting virtually every planetary system in the universe. There are thousands in our galaxy alone. But the Chinese stopped mapping them when they found what they were looking for.
202) 11) dialog: This was their final creation. They had to capture the mini black hole just to have enough power to try it.
202) 23) dialog: It was only used once. The Chinese team attempted to travel back in time, to Earth just a few years after they had left.
202) 27) dialog: I don't know.
206) 19) dialog: I'm curious. It's my nature. See you down the road?
