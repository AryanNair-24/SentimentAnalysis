47) 25) dialog: It's not responding to the handshake. I can't open anything on primary.
47) 46) dialog: It found something.
47) 66) dialog: Why not? We've tested it a hundred times.
59) 11) dialog: Tars was a Marine. They gave him a sense of humor to help him fit in with his unit better.
63) 16) dialog: 
63) 23) dialog: 
63) 47) dialog: I still think we're making a lot of assumptions. About the wormhole. About the planet. (points to map) The critical orbit here is incredibly dangerous. It's like walking on the rim of the volcano.
63) 52) dialog: How do you know that?
63) 56) dialog: I thought you were a scientist, Brand. That sounds more like a hypothesis.
63) 69) dialog: What do you think, Roth?
63) 75) dialog: So you think we'll have no problem navigating between two massive black holes to a tiny planet?
63) 80) dialog: If that's not the plan, then what are we supposed to be doing out there? 49.
74) 6) dialog: So is the wormhole.
95) 21) dialog: I've got a problem over here, too.
95) 25) dialog: It's not the hull... it's inside the ship... it's...
95) 31) dialog: What the hell are they, Case?
95) 36) dialog: It's getting bigger.
95) 56) dialog: None of our testing involved opening the ship inside the wormhole. We have no idea what might happen.
101) 9) dialog: That's not possible. We haven't activated the engines yet.
101) 23) dialog: We're being pulled into it?
101) 30) dialog: You don't know that.
101) 35) dialog: 
101) 40) dialog: If the modelling was wrong, then we can't be sure about anything. We need to go back.
103) 18) dialog: I'm sorry. I can't let you kill us. We have to go back.
105) 3) dialog: Why isn't it slowing down?
118) 4) dialog: The Chinese must have captured them. So they couldn't return to us.
121) 4) dialog: It goes down for a hundred and fifty feet, then stops. Tunnel's old -- the ice has reformed at the bottom.
123) 27) dialog: It would take a thousand feet of ice to shield us.
124) 9) dialog: We'll never make it far enough down.
130) 13) dialog: Why not?
134) 4) dialog: I think we've got a problem.
145) 3) dialog: Looks like the Chinese picked a fight with the locals.
146) 3) dialog: Look at the size of this place. They built it for thousands of people. But no one came.
151) 22) dialog: What problem?
151) 34) dialog: I think I know what the problem is.
151) 37) dialog: Look.
151) 40) dialog: There's a small black hole moving into the system. Too small for us to have seen in our survey. It's not going to hit the planet, but it's going to come close.
151) 44) dialog: This place isn't paradise. It's doomed. Just like us.
151) 52) dialog: So much for the plan.
151) 82) dialog: What the hell is happening?
153) 7) dialog: All that from one tiny box.
158) 9) dialog: We're not going to stick around to count them. Let's get out of here.
158) 17) dialog: What about the escape rocket at the Chinese base camp? One of us could fit into it. 105.
158) 25) dialog: Sure. But we don't have nearly enough power for lift off.
162) 3) dialog: Control systems inside are online.
163) 3) dialog: Close the door.
171) 5) dialog: I'm setting a course for the wormhole.
173) 34) dialog: My kids...
173) 62) dialog: That's easy for you to say. You didn't leave anyone behind.
173) 109) dialog: The wormhole. Look -- it's being pulled into the black hole as well.
173) 125) dialog: How much time are we losing? 117.
173) 133) dialog: This is it. We're going to be pulled in.
173) 143) dialog: Hurry up.
175) 4) dialog: We only have a few minutes before we're swallowed into that thing. What are we even looking for?
177) 4) dialog: We're not going to be able to slow down. Hold onto something.
192) 3) dialog: They just appeared.
192) 34) dialog: That's our solar system.
192) 48) dialog: Where?
202) 14) dialog: What does it do?
202) 30) dialog: Do you really think it works?
208) 3) dialog: Let's go home.
208) 11) dialog: We get back to earth, you and I can try to make sense of the code. Rebuild the gravity machine.
208) 18) dialog: Of course it's going to work.
208) 29) dialog: I don't know what you're talking about, but you're not touching the controls. I'm going home. 138.
208) 35) dialog: You're not stopping me. I'm going home.
