49) 17) dialog: You're the man who brought us the probe? (off his look) Thank you. We tested the telemetry board you warned us about. It failed under high voltage, just as you said. Come with me, please.
50) 3) dialog: You're right, Mr. Cooper. The planet you saw is a long way from earth. A very long way indeed.
50) 6) dialog: Our science officer doesn't think I should trust you with any of this. One of the curious things about humans is that the more alike you are, the more initially hostile you are to each other. As if by design.
50) 9) dialog: I've found the best way to earn a person's trust is to trust them.
50) 13) dialog: (looks at Brand's
50) 23) dialog: Based on the information on the probe, we're finally preparing to send the manned mission.
50) 27) dialog: The main ship was built in orbit. It has nuclear engines, with enough fuel to last for several years.
50) 32) dialog: I know you won't, Mr. Cooper. We're telling you this because I want you to join us.
50) 35) dialog: The probe has taken a great deal longer to return to us than we hoped.
50) 39) dialog: Dr. Brand's Father and several other members of our crew have gotten... older.
50) 42) dialog: We need someone who can run the systems, improvise, work with what's available. All of the skills you seem to have developed.
50) 47) dialog: Humans worry about things like rank and experience. I'm only concerned with whether someone would be useful.
50) 57) dialog: I'm not a scientist, Mr. Cooper. And this is not a scientific mission. It's a rescue mission.
50) 60) dialog: Brand can show you the way out. I hope you'll reconsider. 38.
63) 4) dialog: We've updated our mission parameters based on the data from the probe.
63) 7) dialog: Based on our latest modelling we think the region on the far side of the wormhole is the center of a galaxy.
63) 27) dialog: We're headed for this smaller black hole. Roth calls it Pantagruel. We think the ice planet is here-
63) 30) dialog: We exit the wormhole here. And we slingshot around Pantagruel to reach the ice planet. This is the period in which we'll lose time.
81) 3) dialog: How are you feeling?
81) 7) dialog: No -- I mean how is your mood? You seem to be developing good relations with everyone on the mission. Except perhaps Ms. Brand.
81) 12) dialog: Only five percent of my resources are devoted to human anatomy. Ten percent is the mission protocol. The rest is human psychology.
81) 16) dialog: We are floating in a total vacuum in a plastic ship powered by nuclear engines. But the most dangerous thing onboard is the three pounds of organic material in your skull.
81) 20) dialog: Because humans, despite your obvious physical shortcomings, are better at surviving than we are. Your programming is better than ours. 56.
81) 25) dialog: Would you prefer I was honest? These things can be uncomfortable for humans.
81) 29) dialog: Yes. Of course.
81) 33) dialog: Humans are good at surviving because evolution gave you magical thinking -- the idea that your relationships mean something. You can't explain the feelings, so you think of them as irrational. But they're not. They're programming.
81) 38) dialog: Exactly. You believe it so much you won't listen to me.
81) 42) dialog: When I die, the last thing I will see will be a diagnostic of my own power cycle. Would you like to know the last thing you will see?
81) 45) dialog: This conversation is making you uncomfortable. We should stop. 57.
81) 49) dialog: The last thing you will see before you die will be your children.
85) 3) dialog: Deploy the comms relay. 59.
87) 3) dialog: Everyone take their station for transit. We're heading into the wormhole mouth.
95) 9) dialog: The hull is intact. Thirty more seconds transit.
95) 15) dialog: Hull integrity is fine.
95) 33) dialog: I don't know. It could be gravitational turbulence.
95) 54) dialog: Release the second mouth.
95) 58) dialog: We're going to find out.
95) 64) dialog: We're reaching the far end of the wormhole.
99) 3) dialog: Reconfigure the engines and test the communications array.
101) 13) dialog: Roth. Why are we moving?
101) 20) dialog: Doyle. Fire the engines. Now.
101) 43) dialog: Shut down the engines.
105) 9) dialog: 
107) 6) dialog: Secure yourselves. The ship should be able to withstand the blast.
109) 5) dialog: It's going to be close, but we're going to make it.
117) 11) dialog: The other probes should be directly beneath us.
117) 21) dialog: They didn't do a very good job.
123) 21) dialog: We have to go down.
151) 5) dialog: I've found the Chinese mission logs. They're encrypted.
151) 15) dialog: They got here twenty years ago. The human crew was killed by radiation the first day. But the robots survived. They built the colony and radioed home. But they didn't receive a response.
151) 19) dialog: 
151) 24) dialog: It doesn't say. Their science team took the ship to continue exploring the system. It says they found some kind of...
151) 28) dialog: The science team returned after five years with a new technology. They began the experiments upstairs, then they left again and never returned. 95.
151) 32) dialog: I don't know. They've deleted their mission plan. There's nothing else.
151) 49) dialog: A few years. A decade at most.
151) 69) dialog: It's nighttime. The native life- forms are mobile again.
153) 20) dialog: Wherever they went, they found something that allowed them to build it.
153) 44) dialog: In the morning we're taking this and going home.
155) 3) dialog: We need to hurry. We only have a few hours to reach the ice before nightfall.
155) 19) dialog: This is a scientific expedition, not a military one. We are making our way back to our ship.
155) 62) dialog: 
172) 6) dialog: Very well, thank you.
