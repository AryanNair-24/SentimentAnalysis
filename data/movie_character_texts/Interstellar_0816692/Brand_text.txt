45) 38) dialog: Is that what they call stealing these days?
45) 43) dialog: It doesn't.
45) 49) dialog: Really? You're not the kind of guy who turns a combat marine with a supercomputer for a brain into a riding lawn mower?
45) 52) dialog: Get back in your little plane, go back to your farming commune. And don't come back.
45) 59) dialog: I'd trust him a lot more than I'd trust you. Keep moving.
45) 66) dialog: Get it inside.
45) 70) dialog: (points rifle at Cooper) You too. We'll figure out what to do with you later.
46) 5) dialog: This doesn't belong to you.
47) 6) dialog: 
47) 11) dialog: I found them outside with it. It looks like six. Maybe seven. I can't tell from the radiation damage.
47) 28) dialog: What did you do to it?
47) 55) dialog: He's heard enough. If we're going to launch, we need to keep them here until afterwards.
47) 59) dialog: He could endanger the mission.
47) 70) dialog: Now how could you possibly know that?
48) 18) dialog: The mission commander wants to see you. Your son can stay here. He'll be all right with Tars.
49) 5) dialog: 
49) 10) dialog: I'm a biologist. 35.
52) 6) dialog: In the last century strands were limited to one or two species. But this one targets everything. Essentially it's more efficient at consuming our food than we are.
52) 11) dialog: Not yet. But it will. We've grown a dozen forms of it that can. It's just a matter of time before the same ones develop out there.
52) 19) dialog: (shakes her head) Who's going to find it? The universities are a joke. People like you are reduced to scavenging just to get by.
52) 25) dialog: What would be the point? So humanity could spend the last fifty years of its life fighting over the scraps? It's better that they don't know.
52) 31) dialog: A new home for humanity. We'll set up a colony, then return to bring more people across.
52) 35) dialog: Would it be better if we all died?
52) 38) dialog: Look -- I don't have a clue what Case thinks you could add to the mission. You can come with us or you can stay here and wait to die. I don't care.
60) 4) dialog: You don't like this one, you get to help me find a replacement.
61) 5) dialog: We knew we'd need decades of parts and materials. The government was getting rid of some things. So we arranged to take some off their hands.
61) 8) dialog: You know how to use one? (off his look) You just breathe. Tap my arm or bang something metal if you have a problem. And don't get lost.
61) 13) dialog: 
62) 3) dialog: You can set that down over there.
62) 6) dialog: We didn't know what kind of gravity to expect. We experimented with collective organisms in high g environments.
62) 10) dialog: Humans are also collective organisms. 45.
62) 14) dialog: 
62) 20) dialog: It's a paradox. Life couldn't form without gravity. No stars. No planets. The component pieces would just drift apart. But too much of it and you're trapped.
63) 50) dialog: As long as we're careful, we'll make it.
63) 54) dialog: I find it hard to believe that someone would build a wormhole to a planet with water and oxygen just to lead us to a dead end.
63) 58) dialog: A guess. That's right. We don't have time to wait for conclusive proof.
63) 62) dialog: My guess is that the wormhole is there because someone is trying to help us. The same way we used to try to help animals when they were threatened with extinction.
63) 66) dialog: 
66) 6) dialog: I won't.
66) 9) dialog: If we find a habitable environment, I'm staying behind to build the colony.
80) 16) dialog: Smile.
80) 21) dialog: Because it lowers your blood pressure. 55.
83) 3) dialog: We'll be able to communicate with Earth even from the far side of the wormhole.
83) 8) dialog: I can't imagine how tough it would be to leave your kids behind. 58.
83) 12) dialog: Hard to settle down when you've spent your life waiting to leave the planet.
83) 17) dialog: You wouldn't want to get too close to the surface of the sun, either. Black holes are a more stable supply of power than stars in many ways.
83) 21) dialog: I hope so. (looks at him) You don't?
95) 44) dialog: This isn't turbulence. Look at the way they're moving -- it's like something's examining us.
101) 7) dialog: We're moving.
105) 17) dialog: Saving us.
109) 8) dialog: Tars. His transponder is still working.
111) 10) dialog: I've already checked it. It's electromagnetic interference. We'll try again in a few hours.
113) 5) dialog: We need all the help we can get. Besides, the alternative is to leave him on the ship alone. You think he'll still be here when we get back?
117) 7) dialog: 
117) 18) dialog: How could the Chinese have gotten here first? The federal government kept the wormhole a secret.
118) 7) dialog: Then how did the probe that Cooper found return? 73.
120) 4) dialog: The whole place has been dosed with huge levels of radiation. What happened here?
120) 9) dialog: The Mars mission? The Chinese claimed it had been destroyed on landing.
121) 6) dialog: I'm going to descend to take some samples. Cooper, want to make yourself useful?
123) 12) dialog: How long do we have left?
123) 18) dialog: Then we die. The radiation will cook us alive.
123) 25) dialog: Not enough time. Case is right. The ice can shield us from some of the x-rays.
124) 6) dialog: A pocket formed by gas. There may be more below.
124) 11) dialog: Shut up. How much time do we have, Roth?
124) 22) dialog: I've found something.
124) 27) dialog: These things... they're alive.
124) 33) dialog: X-rays. They feed on them and emit visible light. They've found a way to survive here.
126) 4) dialog: (looks at rad meter) They're absorbing most of the x-rays.
128) 13) dialog: What do you mean, you're going to let go?
129) 3) dialog: I don't need your help.
129) 9) dialog: Thank you.
130) 5) dialog: Oxygen atmosphere. Pure water. Temperate climate.
130) 11) dialog: I won't need one.
130) 15) dialog: Because I'm not going anywhere. This is our new home.
132) 3) dialog: This is incredible. The organisms trapped in the ice above absorb x- rays and emit light. In return, these plants absorb the light and emit oxygen, which feeds the animals trapped in the ice.
132) 6) dialog: Look at this. I think they're the same organism at a different stage of the life cycle. (shows him the sample) It's fractal. No individual cells -- the structure repeats all the way down.
132) 11) dialog: The soil's been disturbed. So something's been moving. But I haven't seen anything. (notices his look) Cooper... are you nervous?
132) 17) dialog: 
132) 23) dialog: (truly pissed off) Faith has nothing to do with it. You know what you are, Cooper? You're just another in a long line of people saying 'no.' That this isn't going to work. And frankly, I don't have to convince you. 83.
132) 27) dialog: You're on this mission because you're another pair of hands. You want the truth? I told Case we should bring another robot over you. At least then I could just reprogram you to-
132) 32) dialog: Nothing. I just -- I could have sworn it just moved.
132) 40) dialog: No. There really aren't any rules.
132) 43) dialog: (trying to stay calm) Remember, we're the aliens.
132) 46) dialog: Hold very still. Don't make any sudden movements.
136) 6) dialog: No... wait.
138) 3) dialog: I've got you.
139) 6) dialog: It's game theory. The best move is always to cooperate at first.
139) 10) dialog: These organisms have no interest in us. They survive by photosynthesis. All they need is light.
139) 14) dialog: I don't know.
139) 22) dialog: It's a colony organism. It's trying to incorporate you into its structure.
139) 26) dialog: Don't open your mouth.
139) 38) dialog: No. They don't bleed... they don't die... they're just competing... trying out different shapes, looking for the best one. 88.
139) 43) dialog: 
139) 50) dialog: The behavior changes as the animals get bigger and bigger. More sophisticated. More calculated.
139) 55) dialog: I don't know.
140) 4) dialog: These creatures are billions of years older than we are. But they're relatively primitive. They haven't developed tools, culture, language.
140) 8) dialog: I don't know. No one knows how intelligent life began on Earth. But the surface of this planet has virtually no craters. No impacts. It's been sheltered by the local black holes.
140) 12) dialog: Maybe not enough has gone wrong here. Maybe bad luck is the key to intelligent life.
140) 17) dialog: Exactly. Maybe our interaction with them will push them over the top. Maybe that's part of the plan.
140) 21) dialog: Why is it so hard for you to accept that someone might be trying to help us?
143) 4) dialog: They're not going to move now, Cooper. They need to spread themselves as thin as they can to absorb the light. 91.
143) 8) dialog: Cooper, honestly, you're a bit of a-
146) 6) dialog: They will. We can salvage it. This place will save us years. 92.
146) 10) dialog: 
148) 3) dialog: What happened here?
151) 30) dialog: Where did they go?
151) 55) dialog: But I don't understand... why are we here? What are we here for?
151) 58) dialog: What the hell are we here for? I trained my whole life to reach this place.
153) 25) dialog: Maybe we could work with it. Try to improve it.
153) 39) dialog: And go where?
153) 50) dialog: That doesn't help this planet. This creature is doomed. Unlike us it doesn't have anywhere to go.
155) 8) dialog: Who?
155) 28) dialog: This planet is being pulled into the black hole. We all need to leave.
155) 40) dialog: 
155) 45) dialog: This device that you have built -- this could save millions of people. We need to get it back home.
157) 6) dialog: We can't leave them all to die.
158) 7) dialog: Was that the last of them?
158) 19) dialog: It doesn't matter how many of us make it. We have to get this back to earth.
161) 3) dialog: This isn't right, Roth. We can find a way for all of us to leave.
161) 14) dialog: 
162) 9) dialog: Someone's coming.
169) 9) dialog: 
169) 18) dialog: Between you and utter solitude, Cooper, frankly, I'm not sure.
170) 8) dialog: He's gone.
173) 3) dialog: We're safe now.
173) 9) dialog: 
173) 18) dialog: 
173) 24) dialog: A lot... Cooper, maybe it's best if
173) 37) dialog: 
173) 43) dialog: Only a tiny portion of the signal would make it though the wormhole. Besides, no one will be listening anymore.
173) 50) dialog: I thought... I couldn't be sure.
173) 54) dialog: Cooper... we needed to keep going. I'm so sorry. Your children...
173) 59) dialog: Listen, the important thing is that we're going home, now. And we have something that can save everyone. It's more important than the people we left behind-
173) 71) dialog: He's gone. But there are other people who still need our help. There's still time...
173) 75) dialog: Case... what are you doing?
173) 79) dialog: Wait... no... 115.
173) 94) dialog: No... We're being pulled back to Pantagruel.
173) 112) dialog: It's orbit mirrored the ice planet's.
173) 116) dialog: It'll be destroyed, like everything else.
173) 127) dialog: 
173) 137) dialog: What are you doing?
173) 149) dialog: We can use the thrusters to keep us on the critical orbit. Then slingshot us towards Gargantua.
175) 10) dialog: It's another wormhole.
181) 5) dialog: I don't know. It's like we entered the wormhole and never left it.
184) 4) dialog: I'm sorry. I should have told you. I didn't have the right.
186) 4) dialog: Our last trip past the black hole cost us another 100, maybe 200 years. Which means there's a good chance we're the only humans alive anywhere. 121.
186) 7) dialog: I think the last human beings should have a little more fight in them than that.
190) 6) dialog: I think Doyle's been experimenting with the coolant from his spacesuit.
190) 11) dialog: I don't know. Maybe. (looks him in the eye) Yes.
190) 16) dialog: 
190) 22) dialog: I thought you didn't believe in one.
190) 29) dialog: I don't know. Maybe it just adds up to this.
190) 34) dialog: Maybe that's enough.
192) 9) dialog: I think these are the creatures that built the wormhole.
192) 14) dialog: No. I don't think it's in our universe at all. I think it lives in the bulk -- the space that the wormholes traverse. And it can only interact with us using gravity.
192) 29) dialog: Where would we even start? Maybe--
192) 41) dialog: That's us. That's where they've brought us. We're in the bulk.
192) 46) dialog: They're moving us.
197) 11) dialog: How do you know?
197) 16) dialog: Time. That's what the bulk beings wanted to give us. That was the treasure the Chinese found. Enough time to let us save ourselves.
201) 22) dialog: Because they were too late. By the time they found this place, the people who sent them were dead. They were unable to fulfill their mission.
202) 4) dialog: Where do they lead?
202) 20) dialog: But that's impossible...
203) 3) dialog: You know it doesn't work. Time travel isn't possible.
203) 7) dialog: Yes, I do. If it worked, the Chinese would have suddenly discovered all of these incredible technologies. But they never made it.
203) 11) dialog: If you try to use it, you'll die, just like the people who built it.
203) 14) dialog: Roth was right, Cooper. We have to keep going. Keep exploring. We have an obligation to try to survive. From here we could find a thousand places where life could thrive. And you're going to return to the one place where it can't.
205) 3) dialog: I came to say goodbye.
206) 5) dialog: This one's done all right by us so far.
206) 8) dialog: Will you take this with you? It's the last of its kind as well. Thought we should double its chances of survival. In case I'm wrong.
206) 13) dialog: I don't know. Up there, I guess.
206) 22) dialog: Come with us. Please. You wanted your whole life to explore. This is your chance.
206) 28) dialog: You're a man who keeps his promises. Make me one-
206) 31) dialog: After you're done... come find me.
