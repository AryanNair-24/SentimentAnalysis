7) 85) dialog: Oh. Of course, He was to have left some things for me.
7) 93) dialog: He's been telling me quite a bit about you lately. My husband. He says you're very efficient.
7) 97) dialog: What is it that makes you so efficient, Sergeant?
7) 102) dialog: I love that. Well, good-bye, Sergeant.
8) 5) dialog: It doesn't matter.
8) 9) dialog: Yes? What did the General have to say?
8) 16) dialog: If you'd spend less time buttering Generals and more time with your Company, maybe you'd get that promotion.

20) 4) dialog: Oh. If it isn't Sergeant Warden. You better step inside or you'll get wet.
20) 15) dialog: If you're looking for my husband, he isn't here.
20) 19) dialog: 
20) 25) dialog: I haven't the slightest idea. Perhaps he's in town. I guess it was `in town' the way you put it, wasn't it? Or perhaps he's at the Club. Having a drink.

21) 37) dialog: Waste, did you say? Now that's a subject I might tell you something about. There's we. And then there's waste. Positive and negative. The negative is sometimes more interesting... more evil. For example -- what about the house without a child? Tell me your thoughts, Sergeant.
21) 41) dialog: Not if I can help it.
21) 48) dialog: What are you doing?
21) 52) dialog: 
21) 59) dialog: Maybe... why not?
21) 64) dialog: You don't have to spend money on me, Sergeant.
21) 68) dialog: Maybe. 31.
30) 2) text: Karen sits on the bench, her ankles crosses primly, very at ease. There is Payday activity here also; amorous strolling couples; men in ones and twos looking for picku Several unattached men pass Karen, ogle her. She is about get up and leave when Warden comes into shot, stands over her. His civilian suit is neat and well-cut. Both are strained, awkward, antagonistic. Now that the step has be taken they are not at all sure it was a clever one.
30) 4) dialog: Why, hello. I didn't think you were coming.
30) 8) dialog: No, I guess you're not. But then I came a little early. I must have been overanxious. You weren't overanxious though, were you? You got here right on the dot.
30) 12) dialog: You certainly chose a savory spot for our meeting.
30) 16) dialog: No, but I've had five chances to be picked up in the last few minutes. 48.
30) 23) dialog: Well, I don't care for it. I never went in much for back-alley loving.
30) 27) dialog: You probably think I'm a tramp, don't you?
30) 31) dialog: Don't try to be gallant, Sergeant. If you think this is a mistake, come right out and say so.

34) 10) dialog: Nobody ever kissed me that way... not really...
34) 18) dialog: No. Nobody.
34) 22) dialog: Well, that will take some figuring. How many men do you think there've been?
34) 27) dialog: Not without an adding machine. Do you have your adding machine with you?
34) 31) dialog: Then I guess you won't find out, will you?
34) 36) dialog: What's the matter? What are you hinting at?
34) 40) dialog: I don't know. Maybe a lot. Or maybe you just think there's a lot.
34) 46) dialog: You must be crazy -- !
34) 51) dialog: I had to go and forget you were a man -- with the same rotten filthy mind the rest of them have. For a minute I had to convince myself you were different --
34) 55) dialog: Yes, it's true! A part of it, some small part of whatever sewage you've been listening to. Some day perhaps you'll get all the story.

34) 70) dialog: I'd been married to Captain Dana E. Holmes two years. Only he was a First Lieutenant then. Back at Fort Bliss. We lived right on a little lake where we could fish and swim and be alone, our 'dream cottage'... I'm sure you must be able to picture it. It was off on a back road, four miles from the highway. Two miles from a neighbor and a telephone.... (pauses, then rushes on) I hadn't been married long when I knew my husband was stepping out on me. But -- you get used to that. Your mother tells you that it's life, that i t happens to a lot of women. Of course, she doesn't tell you until after it happens.
34) 72) text: reacting with fury toward Holmes, compassion for Karen.
34) 74) dialog: Then, by that time, you're pregnant. And at least you've something else to hope for. I think I was almost happy that night the pains began. Even though they were weeks too early, a whole month too early. I remember Dana was putting on that dapper silk gabardine uniform he used to wear. He was going to an officer's 'seminar.' He was kidding me about false labor. I didn't think it was humorous. I told him to get home early, to bring the doctor with him. He smiled tenderly and told me about the psychic reactions of women to pregnancy. But never fear, he'd be back early. And maybe he would have... if the 'seminar' hadn't been with the hat-check girl in one of the night clubs. 59.
34) 82) dialog: He was only a little drunk when he came in... at five a.m. He looked alarmed when he saw me. I guess it was because of my screams. I was lying there on the floor, you see -- No, don't say anything. I'm not finished yet. Of course, the baby was dead. It was a boy. But they worked over me at the hospital and fixed me up fine. They even took my appendix out, too. They threw that in free. It was all fine.
34) 86) dialog: And, of course, one more thing no more children. Do you know what that means? You're not a woman. You're not anything. You're a gutted shell... Sure, I went out with some of the men after that. A few months of it. I'd been made dirty and I wanted to be clean. You can see that, can't you?... Anyway, I got my revenge on Dana. I kept on living with him.
34) 90) dialog: You hunt so hungrily for love... love, if you can find it, you think, might give things meaning again.
34) 94) dialog: All right. I'm listening.
34) 99) dialog: I know. Until I met you I didn't think it was possible, either.

49) 42) dialog: You just love to shock people, don't you?! Where on earth did you learn to dance like that?
53) 8) dialog: What did she say?
53) 13) dialog: Home... A beach, a car, a park...

53) 35) dialog: You're eligible for the extension course that came in with the draft. When you get your commission they'd ship you back to the States -- new officers aren't kept at posts where they've been enlisted men. Then --
53) 39) dialog: Then I could divorce Dana and follow you and marry you.
53) 43) dialog: That's a fine, intelligent point of view. Suppose I said I've always hated Sergeants. That would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?
53) 51) dialog: You can't be certain of that --
53) 56) dialog: 
53) 60) dialog: You just don't want the responsibility. You're probably not even in love with me --
53) 64) dialog: I don't know what's happened to you -- you were honest at first --
53) 69) dialog: And so they were married and lived unhappily ever after.
