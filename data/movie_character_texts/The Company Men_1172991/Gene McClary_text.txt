Archer's still there. GENE (cont'd) Give us a minute, would you? (Archer moves off) What do you want me to do, parrot back everything you say?

Gene takes a breath -- shi GENE (cont'd) Sally... Nothing, her back to him, pulling on her clothing. He reaches across, gently touches her back, but she stands, disappears into the bathroom. Off Gene --
12) 150) dialog: She's sixty, I doubt her "kids" are still in school, much less calling her Mommy. (and) Phil Woodward's on here again. Gene's staring at Wilcox. lLandry looks around, answers.
12) 152) dialog: I wasn't talking to you, Dick. It's tough, meant to shut Landry up. It doesn't. *
12) 156) dialog: What are you, deaf? Shut the fuck up. (back to Wilcox) The Royal Caribbean thing wasn't his fault, they were frightened away by all the takeover talk.
12) 158) dialog: Cut the Harvard Business school bullshit and take him off the goddam list. She's shocked, a deer in the headlights, looks to Hansen support. Hansen leans forward to Gene, proceeds evenly.
12) 160) dialog: I'm looking and all I see are people over fifty with just enough young ones thrown in to protect us against litigation. Hansen stares flatly at Gene.
12) 162) dialog: What about ethical scrutiny?
12) 166) dialog: I guess I always assumed we were trying for a higher standard than that, Paul.
12) 181) dialog: What the hell was "what"?

12) 185) dialog: So loyalty and experience mean nothing?
12) 187) dialog: So don't do it.

12) 234) dialog: Hang on, Phil. So at the end of this hour long rant we turn to the translator and the guy says... "Mr. Lan say no." Now everyone's laughing, Lake, Jane.
