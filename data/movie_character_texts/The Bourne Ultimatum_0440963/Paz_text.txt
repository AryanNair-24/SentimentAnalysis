Bourne turns right-- Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into th top of Bourne's leg. REVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane. As Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at t intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punche it into the side of Bourne's car.

Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy SUV into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the oncoming traffic. Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the street ahead. The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches it back into the lane as it slams against the front of Paz's SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parke cars.
