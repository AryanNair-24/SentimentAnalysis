The search for Bourne, but can't find him at first... Bourne gets the car engine on - but, given the wonders of modern anti-theft technology his steering wheel is still locked. A second CRI car arrives. Bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high speed. He smashes into the car across the aisle from him. With a sharp metallic snap the wheel in Bourne's car is suddenly free, he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and stops. Three CRI cars here now. Two head straight for him.   A third blocks the exit ramp. Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepow of an M-4 (an M-16 variant whose bullets can penetrate metal and concrete). They move into position to get a bea on him. Bourne assesses. But he doesn't move. The agents swarm toward him. What the hell is he doing? Why is he waiting?

Petal to the metal in reverse-- The agents open fire. Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshiel But there's no dodging the shower of broken glass. As Bourne disappears below the dashboard, the CRI agent adjusts his fire into the car's grill. Virtually blind, Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle backwards as the agent's fire decimates the car's driveline. Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek behind him. Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a sma gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking structure. Bourne's car splits the gap between the parked cars, hits the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his car up and over the wall. Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall, a second later the front end seesaws over the top, the sudd angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bourne' car, to the shooters. Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past Bourne's head just before his car drops upside down for 2 feet and slams onto a row of parked cars. The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard against the roof. Bourne struggles out of the car, knowing he has only a moment before the armed agents will fire down into his ov turned car.

Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne i a head on charge. The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control, shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to the floor as he dives out of the car. The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapse glass shatters, and airbags explode. Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as h car implodes against the oncoming agents. Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parke cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to th course of the wrecked one. The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps ou and points his gun at the driver. The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the sedan's front tire and fires. The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and sla into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against the unyielding interior of the sedan. An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it. With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne ha to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan. Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance i cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roo arrives and opens fire. The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single shot.
