1) 13) dialog: How'd you know I liked Snickers?

2) 5) dialog: Nice shooting, Radar. Come here often?
2) 7) dialog: What the hell would ya wanna do that for? An instant distaste for authority. Jewell notes it.

3) 18) dialog: That's right. Fair exchange. So, here it is: When you get your badge -- and I can see that day is coming -- don’t become an asshole.
3) 20) dialog: A little power can turn a person into a monster, Richard. Don’t let that happen to you. Understand? Jewell has NO idea how to respond. Bryant just stares.

54) 13) dialog: Would you connect me to the field office, Nadya?

54) 18) dialog: (into phone) Yes, you do. Put me on the phone with my client, please. Now.
54) 20) dialog: Goddammit. Nadya dials again. Bryant hears --
54) 22) dialog: (into phone) This is Watson Bryant again, attorney for Richard Jewell. My next call is going to be to Mike Wallace of ‘Sixty Minutes’ to ask him why the FBI would deny a citizen his constitutional right to legal counsel. Can I have the spelling of your name, please? (CONTINUED)
55) 3) dialog: (into phone) Richard, it’s Watson. What’re you doing in there?
55) 5) dialog: (into phone) They don’t! You’re a suspect. Have you signed anything? Have you confessed to anything?

So Bryant tries a tension-breaker:

57) 5) dialog: For the next little while, the only person you need to talk to is me.
57) 7) dialog: He does not open his mouth again if there is a cop present, or an FBI agent, or someone from GBI, or a CROSSING GUARD. Is that clear?
57) 9) dialog: ‘Authority’ is what’s outside that window, looking to eat you alive. (as Jewell reacts) Let’s get to work. INT. BOBI’S APT. - 2 AM 85 Bobi sleeps. Jewell looks out the window at the MOB.

57) 42) dialog: Want me to call the cops? (CONTINUED)
57) 46) dialog: Out. Kathy eyes him. We --
57) 49) dialog: I think whoever the bum was who leaked that Richard Jewell was the focus of this investigation should be prosecuted or dealt with in some serious way. I don’t think that this investigation should be, aaahhh, conducted under world spotlight like this.
57) 51) dialog: Because I’ve known Richard for a while. I’ve looked him in the eye and I’ve asked him the question.
57) 53) dialog: I don’t know a lot of things about a whole lot of people that I know. (CONTINUED)
57) 57) dialog: I, uh, I have not yet conducted a thorough investigation into Richard and his history. I don’t have Richard’s police record. You may.

69) 3) dialog: Coulda ridden a bike, I guess.

70) 4) dialog: Were you expecting a zombie invasion or something?
70) 8) dialog: Richard, I wanna explain something to you. Okay? All you’re guilty of right now is looking like the kind of guy who might set off a bomb. But everything you do that promotes that image is going to hang us. So -- He stops himself. Just saw sheer TERROR in Bobi’s eyes.
70) 9) dialog: Sorry. Poor choice of words. I just, is there anything else odd or quirky I’m going to discover today?
70) 12) dialog: You don’t talk. I talk. Say it.
70) 14) dialog: See, that’s TALKING. That’s what we don’t want.
70) 16) dialog: It’s like the United Goddamn Colors of Benetton.
70) 19) dialog: That’s right. Bryant hands Shaw a business card, “The Law Offices of G. Watson Bryant.” Shaw eyes it, deeply unimpressed. Bennet hands Bryant a bag. Bryant takes it, angrily.

71) 9) dialog: Hold on, fellas! The agents head for the FBI TRUCKS. Bryant bounds down the steps into the PARKING LOT in pursuit, but -- THE MOB CONSUMES HIM, instantly SURROUNDING him in a cocoon of bodies so tight that he can’t get through.
71) 10) dialog: Excuse me. Excuse me. I need to -- No room to move at all. And the QUESTIONS come:

71) 37) dialog: (yanks phone away) The hell it is!

80) 10) dialog: I’m sick of everyone calling you fat. B: You don’t need any more attention.
80) 12) dialog: Richard, you just gave the world a headline: ‘Jewell Tries to Buy Off Cops with Donuts!’ I can’t help you if you’re gonna let them make a joke out of you.
80) 14) dialog: They’re NEVER gonna like you. Let’s just get ‘em to respect you. Okay? He opens Jewell’s GLOVE COMPARTMENT to stuff the bag in - ... which is when Bryant sees a small TEDDY BEAR inside. Huh? Bryant just stares, then extracts the Teddy bear.
80) 15) dialog: What's this?
80) 17) dialog: Never know when you’re gonna happen upon a car wreck, I guess.
80) 21) dialog: Let’s keep this between us, so they don’t accuse you of being a child molester. Jewell starts up the truck, pulls out -- right past Shaw. Bryant tosses the DONUTS into Shaw’s window.

81) 43) dialog: Richard... We have to get you a proper defense attorney. Huh? That hovers. Jewell eyes Bobi...
81) 45) dialog: This is out of my league. You know that. A month ago I was doing real estate closings.
81) 49) dialog: Well, I don’t always trust cops, but sometimes I NEED one. And right now you need a defense attorney who specializes in capital crimes. Preferably from a small firm that the Bureau respects. That’s not me.
81) 51) dialog: Listen, Goddammit --
81) 54) dialog: Night, you two. They get out. Bryant watches them go. The MOB descends, instantly suffocating Jewell and Bobi. Jewell grabs her hand, plowing through the bodies -- Bryant looks sickened. He gets out of his car, SHOUTS:
81) 55) dialog: You’re killing him! Every Goddamn one of you KILLING A PERSON. Aren’t you ashamed of yourselves? No one in the mob replies. But Jewell and Bobi appreciated it. They make it safely into their apartment. Door shuts. The mob dissipates.

83) 1) dialog: They want your hair now. And your palm prints, the damn bastards. Jewell sags. Bobi’s not around. We --
83) 4) dialog: I want you to know, you might have a warrant for this -- but if you wanted to do this to me you’d have to fight me. You’d have to beat the shit out of me.
83) 10) dialog: Tell me, Richard, you still proud to be law enforcement?
83) 12) dialog: You’re right. He’s a monster. Have you dummies done the math yet on the call from the pay phone?
83) 14) dialog: I actually feel sorry for you guys. When the real bomber does it again, and the country asks, ‘Where was the FBI?’ You’re gonna say, ‘We were busy getting hair samples from Richard Jewell’?
83) 20) dialog: There’s the door. They leave. Medic follows. Bryant steaming.
83) 21) dialog: We need to start being a little less solicitous and a lot more righteous with these bastards.
83) 23) dialog: 
83) 27) dialog: You’re angry?
83) 29) dialog: Then stop being such a doormat! Stop tryin’ to be their best friend! I’m tired of it.
83) 31) dialog: Yeah? Like what? (as Jewell’s silent) Like what? Jewell walks into the kitchen, leaving Bryant alone. We hear a CABINET opening. Bryant calls out:

CHILIVIS BLDG./BRYANT’S 4RUNNER - MORNING 144 This normally dead street is PACKED with PRESS today. Bryant drives Jewell into the driveway/alley of this building, his truck pushing the MOB aside as he smiles warmly for the cameras. Instantly, Nadya (in her car) and Dave Dutchess (in his) pull their cars NOSE-TO-NOSE in front of the alley, blockading it behind Bryant’s.
90) 2) dialog: You'd trust them with the results? Bryant opens the shades, waves out the window.

92) 3) dialog: Can I tell you something, Richard? (as Jewell shrugs) I went to Episcopal school as a kid. When I was in first grade, two nuns accused me of writing something unholy on my desk -- Jewell’s wondering: Why is he telling me this?
92) 4) dialog: I hadn't done it, but they were sure I had. So they sent me back to kindergarten for a week -- just to humiliate me; then they asked me if I’d learned my lesson. I said I hadn’t because I hadn’t written on the desk in the first place. They asked me how I’d like to go sit in kindergarten for TWO weeks. I said, ‘You can throw me in there for a year -- I still can’t apologize for writing on the desk because I DIDN’T DO IT.’
92) 8) dialog: I did. And they backed off. (re: FBI agents) Power doesn’t make a person right. Just tell your story, okay? Jewell nods, ready. INT. BRYANT’S OFFICE - 4 HOURS LATER - DAY 149 Bryant and Nadya sleep on the couch. Rackleff enters after a 4-HOUR test, exhausted. Nadya bolts up. Bryant waits, afraid to breathe.

93) 6) dialog: It was a souvenir from the bombing. Not the bomb. I said that when you asked for a quote.
93) 8) dialog: And who are you to make fun of a guy for staying with his mother? She was going to have SURGERY; he wanted to help her out. What’s weird about that? Tell him. (off no reply) While you’re at it you can tell him how he ‘approached this newspaper seeking publicity for his actions.’ Which he didn’t.
93) 11) dialog: Or how he fits the lone-bomber profile to a T, a ‘wannabe’ seeking to become a hero, when all he did was actually SAVE LIVES. Go ahead. We’ve got all day.
93) 13) dialog: So's Richard. With that, Bryant and Jewell head out. Kathy’s silent.

He turns: It's an OFFICE CLERK... pushing a SUPPLY CART BY us. Pens, Scotch Tape, etc. Jewell watches him go, memories swirling. Bryant, too.
99) 7) dialog: See if he’s got any Snickers bars, will ya? Jewell almost laughs. Almost.
99) 8) dialog: You know what a 1001 is, Richard?
99) 10) dialog: It's a felony. You say anything in there that isn’t true, they can put you in jail without ever proving you're a bomber. So if you don’t know what to say, you say nothing. You ask for a five- minute break, you consult with me. But you do not improvise. Got it? Jewell nods. Bennet leans out of the conference room --
100) 1) dialog: Who does your decorating? Ted Kaczynski? A small jab, but it made Bryant feel better. RETURN TO:
101) 3) dialog: Are you ready?
101) 5) dialog: I mean ready -- to look at these guys not as suspect to agent but as cop to cop. Don’t give them any more deference than they’re due, Richard. They don’t deserve it. And DON’T keep calling them ‘sir.’ (CONTINUED)
101) 9) dialog: No. They aren’t the U.S. Government. They’re just three pricks who WORK for the U.S. Government. Understand the difference? Nobody in that room is a better man than you, Richard. Believe me. (as that landed) You'll be fine. A father-son moment. It got through. Jewell rises.
103) 1) text: Jewell has been in here for hours, flanked by Bryant.
