It's of a candy- striped pole topped with a silver ball, surrounded by international flags - the South Pole. Carrie is standing next to the pole, smiling at the camera, arm-in-arm with SAM MURPHY (30's). Looks like he's handsome, but his face is a little more obliterated than the rest of him.
1) 7) text: We PICK UP CARRIE AND FOLLOW her as she strides down the icy, unmade street. Her hood is pulled up and she's not enjoying the cold.

2) 71) dialog: Good. And how are you feeling right now?
2) 75) dialog: (PACIFYING) No, no, not crazy. But this time of year, down here, we're all going a little toasty aren't we? How about you plant a little Cannabis when you get home?

9) 34) dialog: ...Were you the second guy from the front?
9) 38) dialog: Not interested.

12) 1) text: Carrie and Doc cross the interior, which houses Three double prop Twin Otters, two Snowcats, and six snowmobiles. Keller and two other employees are busy working on one of the Otters.
12) 5) dialog: My gut and I don't talk anymore.
12) 7) text: CARRIE (cont'd) I saw your boxes packed up. What was all that BS last month about, "I'm never going back -- I'll die here. Scatter my ashes over the pole"?

13) 14) dialog: He's cute.   Has your eyes.
13) 18) dialog: So why aren't you with him?

14) 57) text: Carrie unzips the gear bag.      Digs out ice two axes.
14) 67) text: A pile of chopped ice is off to the side of corpse. Delfy, who looks very uneasy about all this, grabs the feet as Carrie and Doc each grab an arm.
14) 69) dialog: You going to be alright?
14) 78) dialog: Oh yeah -- I'm really going to miss this place.

16) 22) text: They share a moment, Carrie understanding, but --
16) 24) dialog: Nobody wants to get out of here more than I do, trust me, but right now -- we're all this guy has.

20) 50) text: Suddenly, Carrie's NEXTEL RINGS -- takes it off her belt.
20) 51) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Stetko.

She's hovering over one of the Techs who is sitting before a computer screen displaying Satellite Weather Imagery -- think Doppler.

24) 6) dialog: The Russians barely supply Vostok anymore. They have to barter with other bases for supplies. Some of these guys have been rotting here for years.

27) 1) text: Carrie leans into the door, pushing it closed and locking the wheel.
27) 4) text: Slowly regaining her stance, she pushes onward. Finally Carrie runs into something. It takes her a moment to realize she's at a building.

29) 34) text: The killer yanks his axe free of Mooney as Carrie bolts around the sofa, heading back out the door.

31) 4) text: CARRIE'S door slams open first and the wind hits her hard.
32) 1) text: Carrie jumps into the whiteout, catching the red storm line and clipping in as she staggers forward. Glancing back, she sees the killer in the doorway, then loses sight of him as she's swallowed in the whiteout.

32) 4) text: He swings. She jumps back, losing her footing. Hits the ice hard -- face first. The killer towers over her, raising the axe again. Carrie drives her heel into his knee, knocking him off balance. He drops next to her.
32) 5) text: He reaches for Carrie, grabbing her mask, pulling it off. She cries out as the FREEZING WIND catches her face.
32) 6) text: The killer gets to his feet and delivers a rib-cracking kick, flipping Carrie onto her back.

34) 1) text: Carrie lurches forward, holding the line with one arm.
34) 2) text: Finally, she bumps into something. It moves. It turns to face her. IT'S THE KILLER AGAIN. He swings. She deflects the blow with her free arm, and manages to grab the axe head. The killer tears the axe free, taking Carrie's glove with it.
34) 3) text: He swings again, but Carrie pulls hard on the rope, throwing him off balance.
34) 4) text: The axe cuts through the line. The killer hits the ground, and is immediately ushered away in the wind, as Carrie, clinging to the rope, slides over the ice like a pendulum.
34) 9) text: More dead than alive, Carrie stumbles against the door and grabs the wheel-lock with both hands.
34) 19) text: Carrie falls, collapsing against the door.       Blackout
35) 1) text: A single bulb above casts a cone of light down onto Carrie, who's leaning against a sink, staring at herself in a mirror. She looks stressed. Her Marshal's badge dangles around her neck.   Wears a shoulder harness. The bathroom door behind her is open.
35) 5) dialog: Jack?
35) 8) text: Gun ready, she rolls her back around the jam -- WHAM! Carrie's blindsided by a fist that drives her into the other door jam.
35) 9) text: Before she can recover -- a guy, dark eyes, unshaven, grabs her by the hair and runs her head first into the bathroom mirror. SMASH. It's brutal. Shards fall into the sink, as Carrie's RIGHT TEMPLE goes bloody. She drops to the floor --

36) 3) dialog: What happened?
36) 7) dialog: Yeah. Someone got to him before I did. Then went after me. (BEAT) How long was I out?

36) 14) dialog: Thanks.
36) 17) text: CARRIE (cont'd) I need to get back in there.
37) 1) text: Delfy and Carrie, with her hand bandaged, both slice the dark with flashlights. She's starting to get her bearings back.
37) 8) dialog: Let it go, Delfy.
37) 12) text: Same as before. Carrie goes to the over-turned sofa. Moves her light around -- searching. Passes over the blood on the floor.
37) 15) text: Carrie gets on her knees -- looks under the sofa. Low angles her light. Something reflects.    Reaches in. Retrieves her baton --
38) 1) text: Just as Carrie and Delfy leave the lounge, her perifocal vision picks up a wisp of light from a flashlight, which bled out from a door's threshold halfway down the hall.
38) 2) text: Delfy's eyes go wide -- Carrie's finger goes to her mouth - Shhhhh.

44) 14) text: Carrie moves over to a table with a MAP SPREAD OUT ON TOP. The ice field is marked off into sections.

48) 27) dialog: (SARCASTIC) The excitement, mostly.
48) 31) dialog: Some shrink tell you that?
48) 35) dialog: And do you?
48) 39) dialog: Where do you plant your boots?
48) 44) dialog: I came down to fill in for a Marshal for six weeks before Winter-over. I met someone, decided to stay.
48) 48) dialog: No -- just gave me a headache. (BEAT)
48) 58) dialog: This is it.
48) 61) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Stop.
48) 65) dialog: Just stop.
49) 6) dialog: Section 104.   These are the coordinates.
49) 9) text: Carrie ignores him. Walks further away from the cat. Ice CRUNCHES UNDER HER FEET as she keeps looking -- then, she stops. Something's not right. Looks DOWN.
49) 12) dialog: This is shaved ice.
49) 19) text: CARRIE (cont'd) They were digging, Pryce. And they tries to spread the ice to hide it.
49) 21) text: WHOOSH! In an instant, Carrie's gone! DISAPPEARS below the ice. Only a four foot wide hole remains, that was covered up with a white, iced-over tarp.
49) 23) text: Pryce gets to the hole. Looks down. Carrie is precariously dangling in an ICE SHAFT that slopes at a slight angle. She's managed to grasp a protruding piece of ice, but she's fighting the pain in her left hand to hold on. It slips off. Below her -- nothing but darkness.
49) 24) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Grab me!
49) 30) dialog: I'm slipping!
49) 34) dialog: I'm losing my grip.
49) 49) dialog: ...I'm okay.
50) 1) text: Darkness. A flashlight clicks on. Reflects off a wall of ice with a frozen blood trail leading up. Carrie gets to her feet. Sees that she's in a small dug out area.
50) 3) text: Carrie shines the light to her feet.        The ground be her is metal.
51) 1) text: Pryce, with a flashlight in hand, lowers himself down a rope to the bottom of the shaft where Carrie waits. Delfy follows. Both take in the discovery.
51) 2) text: Carrie moves over to the hatch. Pulls on it. Opens easily. She and Pryce hit the interior with their lights. Find themselves staring into...AN AIRPLANE!
52) 7) dialog: Cargo plane, but I don't recognize it.
52) 10) text: Carrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness, heading for the cockpit.
52) 12) text: Delfy stands still. Staring.           Carrie throws a lo over her shoulder --
52) 14) dialog: Guess that makes three.
53) 1) text: Carrie pushes the door open.
53) 8) dialog: Where's Pryce?
54) 1) text: Trailing her beam of light, Carrie and Delfy climb through a thick wall of nylon webbing. Enter a cluttered cargo area.
54) 5) dialog: What is that?
54) 9) text: Carrie continues through the hold. Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM flickers over more chaos of the crash. HUGE STEEL TANKS TAKE UP MOST OF THE MID-SECTION.
54) 13) dialog: (SUSPICIOUS) Find what you're looking for?
54) 19) dialog: And by the looks of that safe, must've been transporting something pretty important.
54) 20) text: Carrie moves in closer.   Sees that the cage has been breached.
54) 29) dialog: Whoever got hurt, they dragged him out of here. There's blood all over the tunnel.
54) 32) text: CARRIE (cont'd) What is that?
54) 38) dialog: Go!
54) 42) text: Carrie targets ahead with her light -- illuminates the hatch as A LOAD OF ICE DROPS IN covering it completely. Light fades.
54) 50) text: Carrie and Pryce both pull out their phones.
54) 52) dialog: No signal, you?
54) 54) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Someone followed us.
55) 2) text: Things are desperate as a single flashlight beam propped up on a crate, illuminates Carrie, Delfy and Pryce hard at it -- frantically chopping away at the ice filled hatch with pieces of scrap metal from the plane. Efforts are big-- but the progress minimal.
55) 6) dialog: How long do you figure we've got?
55) 12) text: The light from the flashlight slowly begins to fade. Carrie goes over to the crate, slaps it against her leg, trying to get more juice going. Still fading. Light goes out --
55) 13) text: -- Screen goes black. Can't see a thing. A second later, ANOTHER LIGHT KICKS ON -- Pryce is holding it. Hands it over to Carrie --
55) 22) text: Carries mind whirls with her lack of options, then --
55) 24) dialog: What about the Vodka -- we could make some torches, maybe melt the ice?
55) 28) dialog: What choice do we have?
55) 34) text: Carrie takes a six-inch, pearl handled Buck knife from a pocket, unfolds it-- starts cutting the liner of her coat.
55) 37) text: Carrie looks over to see him staring at two LIFE JACKETS attached to the wall near the hatch. He's thinking.
55) 38) text: He moves to Carrie --
55) 42) text: He shines the light to the ceiling as he heads toward the back, leaving Carrie and Delfy getting swallowed in the dark.
55) 44) dialog: What're you doing?
55) 52) dialog: We came in through it.
55) 58) text: Carrie watches Pryce's flashlight moving about in the cargo area of the aircraft.
55) 61) text: Carrie and Delfy get to Pryce. They follow his beam straight up to expose an ESCAPE HATCH in the roof of the fuselage.
55) 67) dialog: Or, if the ice is too thick the blast will come right back at us.
55) 70) text: Pryce hands Carrie the flashlight. She targets the hatch area as he opens an electrical panel beside it; a crisscrossing maze of wires.
55) 77) text: As he reaches up to examine the wiring, Carrie catches a GLIMPSE of a SHOULDER HARNESS under his liner.
55) 79) text: As he looks down, Carrie masks her discovery.   Hands ove her phone. He extracts the BATTERY.
55) 82) text: He looks to Carrie and Pryce who have backed up against the fuselage.
55) 85) text: Carrie is still running that shoulder holster through her head.
55) 89) text: SLAM, SLAM, SLAM, until...WHAM, it buries itself edge-on, halfway into the fuselage, missing Carrie by a hair's width.
55) 103) text: Just as they finish, Pryce turns to find himself facing Carrie holding one of the RUSSIAN'S GUNS TO HIS FACE.
55) 105) dialog: Don't move.
55) 112) dialog: Our friend here isn't who he says he is.
55) 115) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Didn't you know it's a direct treaty violation to carry a firearm down here?
55) 119) dialog: Stop lying to me --
55) 121) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Delfy, cuff him to the wall.
55) 133) dialog: He was saving his own.   Do it.
55) 134) text: Delfy takes the cuffs from her.  Cuffs Pryce to some exposed piping. Carrie lowers her gun.
55) 135) text: CARRIE (cont'd) You know what was in that safe. (BEAT) Now, who are you?
55) 137) text: CARRIE (cont'd) I swear I'll leave you here to die.
55) 143) dialog: Have you got an ID for that too?
55) 159) dialog: Why did you lie to me?
55) 163) text: Carrie wrestles with her emotions. She looks back towards the open safe, the blood staining the airplane floor. Makes a decision.
56) 1) text: Delfy wriggles out from the hole. He reaches back. Helps Carrie to the surface. Pryce follows.
56) 6) text: Carrie notices a single set of an airplane's ski tracks in the distance.
56) 13) dialog: Plane could've gone anywhere. There's forty-six countries here all counting down to Winter-over. Rubin could just disappear in the mayhem.
56) 15) text: Carrie pulls out her Nextel as Pryce takes out his PDA. She depresses the walkie button -- makes her way to the Cat.
56) 16) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Rhonda?
56) 21) dialog: Heading back. How many fly-ins to McMurdo in the last four hours?
56) 25) dialog: (SNAPS) -- How many?
56) 29) dialog: I need a list of names.
56) 30) text: Carrie clicks off.
56) 34) dialog: He knows I'm on his ass, so he might. Anything's possible. I want to eliminate his options.
56) 44) text: He looks to Carrie --
56) 47) dialog: Back at ASB --
57) 4) text: He hangs up. Carrie climbs in -- looks back at the plane's ski tracks.
57) 6) dialog: I know why Weiss was so far from Delta One One.
57) 8) text: CARRIE cont'd) He was dumped from a plane.
58) 1) text: Carrie strides along the corridor with Pryce. They pass a window where we see that an LC-13O EVAC PLANE is parked out front -- it's tail section open like the mouth of a massive beast. Move past several people, balloons and `Eve of Evac' signs.
58) 2) text: Pryce sees Carrie really cradling her left hand, now.
58) 6) dialog: I'll have the Doc take a peek when we're done.
58) 10) text: Carrie stops.
58) 12) dialog: Murphy?   What the hell is he doing HERE
58) 17) text: Carrie ignores him.
58) 19) dialog: I'm on 30 if you need me. Rubin's picture is in a file on my desk.
58) 29) text: Pryce heads up as Carrie continues on down the main corridor.
59) 17) dialog: You wanted to see me?
59) 18) text: Murphy looks over.       Sees Carrie coming in through th door.
59) 23) dialog: Buried under 2 tons of ice. You?
59) 33) dialog: Sure thing, Chief.
59) 37) dialog: It didn't work, Sam, because you couldn't keep your hands off every new woman who stepped foot on the ice down here. I was stupid enough to be one of them. Now if you could cut through your red tape for just one second, you would realize that someone's out there with six cannisters, possibly full of Uranium, and he wants to get it into the hands of some very bad people. And I'm trying to stop it -- so fuck asking you for shit, Sam.
59) 51) text: Carrie calms down -- she's had enough.
59) 53) dialog: You know what Doc, it's alright.
59) 54) text: Carrie looks to Rhonda --
59) 55) text: CARRIE (cont'd) You got my list?
59) 57) text: Carrie walks out with Doc.
60) 1) text: A SUBJECTIVE POV - watching Carrie and Doc from behind the crack of a door as they walk down the main corridor and right by.
61) 1) text: Carrie's sitting on the edge of an examination table as Doc slowly unwraps her bandaged hand. She winces from the pain.
61) 6) dialog: You worry too much -- but it's what I like about you.
61) 8) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Doc, did you notice if Weiss had a wound on his left leg?
61) 16) dialog: Then it's gotta be Rubin. (BEAT) I don't know.
61) 20) dialog: There's no way they're gonna make it. Not with that storm coming in over the peninsula.
61) 22) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Oh God.
61) 28) dialog: When did I go to Vostok?
61) 32) text: He pushes hard -- penetrates the skin. We see the worry begin to elevate further on Carrie's face.
61) 34) dialog: No.
61) 45) dialog: (STUNNED) No way. Don't tell me that.
61) 48) text: Carrie is sickened.
62) 1) text: Carrie sits in sullen silence, the room dark around her. The only light bounces in from a sterile, draped area where Doc works on her hand. She can't watch as his CURVED SUTURE and thread, rises and falls with every stitch he makes. Carrie has her attention on BLOODY GAUZE piled up in a tray --
62) 4) text: CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT: AN IMAGE SHE SAW EARLIER: The well defined chest of a man wearing a T-shirt. A BULLET HOLE oozes dead center. This time we stay there a little longer, watching the T-shirt absorb the blood around the wound. As the stain widens, so does the camera... slowly... bringing into picture THE MAN Carrie shot. He's wearing a MARSHAL'S BADGE around his neck.
62) 11) text: Carrie looks at him, sullen, afraid to look down.     The slowly lets her eyes drift to her hand.
63) 1) text: Carrie's bag is open on the bed with the Russian's gun next to it.
63) 4) text: Carrie slumps to the floor.    Silent tears.
63) 8) text: Carrie nods, pulling herself together, swallowing her emotion.
63) 10) dialog: Pretty tough Marshal, huh?
63) 12) text: CARRIE (cont'd) (holds up hand with missing ring FINGER) If you came to propose, now's not really a good time.
63) 19) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Anything?
63) 22) text: They sit in silence together for a moment. Carrie sees the Russian pistol that's ended up on the floor close by. Picks it up. Examines it like a relic.
63) 24) dialog: ...You ever kill anyone?
63) 28) dialog: Anyone you ever trusted?
63) 33) dialog: I hadn't held a gun in my hand for over two years. (LAUGHING) Wasn't supposed to need one down here.
63) 35) text: CARRIE (cont'd) You asked what I was running away from...I came down here to forget my partner, Jack. Thought it would be better than any therapy.
63) 39) dialog: We were on a stakeout at a Holiday Inn in Miami, waiting for this buy to go down. I was excited, we'd been after this trafficker for a long time. Thought this bust would be my big chance to impress the brass. Anyway, guy's a no show. One hour went by, then two - - nothing.
63) 46) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Four years together. I knew things about him that his wife didn't even know.
63) 49) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Marshall service cleared me -- ruled it self-defense, but I had a real hard time getting over the betrayal -- how little my life meant to a guy I was willing to take a bullet for.
63) 50) text: Carrie shifts in her chair.   Leans forward.
63) 51) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Know what the kicker is -- Jack thought I was close to figuring him out. Thought this hotel room was the best place to get rid of me -- make it look like a bust gone bad. Truth is, I had no idea.
63) 54) text: CARRIE (cont'd) You asked me why I smell like suntan lotion -- Jack wore Aramis, this cheap after-shave his wife gave him. Some of the guys down here wear it -- suntan lotion is the only thing that keeps me from smelling it.
63) 63) text: CARRIE (cont'd) What do ya got there?
63) 67) text: As Carrie studies them --
63) 70) dialog: These beakers where really in over their heads.
63) 78) dialog: Think you can you help me with these buttons, first?
64) 1) text: Carrie enters. Light streaming in through the window hits her tired face. She reaches for the light switch on the nearby wall --
64) 7) text: Carrie nods -- slides her hand toward her pocket...
64) 11) dialog: Who are you?
64) 16) text: Carrie's confused.
64) 18) dialog: Mooney's dead.
64) 23) dialog: And so's Weiss.
64) 33) dialog: It's okay, you're safe, just put the knife down.
64) 35) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Who's after you? Where are the cannisters?
64) 40) dialog: Rubin -- I need you to focus for me.
64) 47) dialog: It's okay, he's a doctor, he can help you.
64) 56) text: Carrie appears at the door. Catches a glimpse of Rubin disappearing down a set of side stairs.
64) 57) text: CARRIE (cont'd) You alright?
64) 63) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Pryce --
64) 67) dialog: Rubin's here! He's on the run. Level one. White T-shirt. Jeans.
64) 72) text: As Carrie comes off the stairs -- looks left -- there's three guys carrying boxes out of a room. Snaps a look to the right --
64) 74) text: CARRIE (cont'd) (into walkie) He's heading for the Science Lab.
64) 75) text: Carrie kicks it into high --
66) 1) text: Rubin is moving through to a door at the far end as Carrie enters. It's lined with several free standing, empty bookcases.
66) 3) dialog: Rubin, wait!
67) 1) text: Carrie enters through the connecting tunnel's doorway. Not a lot of light. Slows her pace. It's quiet. Dormant. Vacant lab stations. Room's been shut down for the winter. Eyes scan. Fall upon --
67) 7) text: Carrie gets to the door. Pulls on the handle. Won't open. Rattles. Looks in through a viewing window -- sees --
67) 11) text: He and Carrie exchange glances.

67) 23) text: Rubin bolts back toward the door separating he and Carrie, but --
69) 1) text: Carrie shoulders the door, but still doesn't budge. Hears FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HER. Turns to see it's Pryce.

69) 5) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Pryce, it's not Rubin --
69) 7) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Someone's trying to kill him.
70) 6) text: Carrie throws a look outside -- bottom of stairs are vacant. Ice axe is still there.
70) 8) dialog: Shit, Rubin doesn't have any gear on.
70) 9) text: Carrie immediately closes the outside door. Pryce goes for the ECW wear. Scrambles to get a coat on. Carrie joins. Same thing.
70) 13) dialog: Thirty seconds.
73) 1) text: Carrie and Pryce, now bundled up in ECW, exit the room and head down the stairs. Split up -- go opposite directions around the complex.
75) 1) text: Carrie passes a gap between storage containers where several snow shovels are stuck into a mound of snow -- through their vertical slats, SHE CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF RUBIN at the Snow Melter across on the other side of the main building. Sees the ECW guy closing in.
76) 1) text: Pryce is moving under ASB. Passes a hydraulic support leg. Spots Carrie on the other side moving toward Rubin. Also sees the ECW guy in pursuit. Heads toward them.
79) 9) text: Carrie pulls his parka hood away from his head -- snaps the goggle from his face.
79) 12) text: The shovel's courtesy of Carrie, who stands over top of him. Holds the shovel to his neck like a guillotine blade.
79) 13) text: Pryce approaches. Glances to Rubin's frozen body -- neck askew. Carrie is wound up. Keller's still recovering from the impact --
79) 17) dialog: Where are the cannisters?
79) 23) dialog: Help me drag him over here.
79) 25) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Keep him still.
79) 27) text: Carrie pulls her Buck knife from her back pocket, then whips off Keller's gloves. Tosses them aside. The cold makes him more coherent. Sees Pryce at this throat.
79) 30) text: Keller shifts his attention to Carrie, who's using her knife to SLICE open his ECW jacket and pants, exposing bare arms and legs.
79) 40) dialog: Why did you kill those scientists, Keller? Was a four-way split too much for you?
79) 43) text: Carrie grabs the hose from the Snow Melter.

79) 72) dialog: The cannisters are on the plane.
79) 74) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Throw him in the holding cell.
79) 75) text: The two guys go to Keller, but his arm is stuck to the ground. Carrie kicks it free. It's painful. Keller screams.

79) 104) dialog: We'll need some help.
80) 1) text: Carrie is near the cockpit, searching under a row of seats. Pryce approaches. A handful of ASB employees tear through every inch of the fuselage and cargo.
80) 4) text: Carrie gets to her feet.    Pissed off.
80) 7) dialog: Nothing. That bastard. What the hell are you up to, Keller?

87) 6) text: Then, with a nod from Carrie, they move in. Fast. Ready. Look into the plane. It's empty, except for a duffle bag in the back. Carrie nods to Pryce. Motions for him to go one way, she'll go another.
87) 10) text: Carrie gets to the Cat.    Springs toward the door. Inside's empty.
87) 20) text: Keller spots Carrie over by the Cat. She fires continually, forcing him to stay behind cover. The shots go wide -- she's not yet used to firing with the right hand.
87) 23) text: Carrie keeps shooting. Bullets PING OFF THE TOOL CHEST. They stop. Carrie has to reload.
87) 24) text: Keller makes his move. Fires at Carrie and sprints for his plane. Runs right by pole with a large red button attached to it. Slams it.
87) 29) text: Carrie makes her move.   Dashes toward him, firing away.
87) 32) text: Carrie dashes to Pryce. Sees Delfy get to his feet. Face bloody. He moves to Pryce.

88) 42) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Don't let him die.
88) 43) text: Carrie stands.   Determined.   Sprints back into the hangar.

93) 34) text: Carrie slowly gets to her feet. The flames reflecting off her goggles. She heads to the wreckage. The cold and blowing snow extinguishing the flames quickly.
93) 41) text: Carrie approaches. Only a sputtering of flame remains on the front of the twisted remnants of the Otter's cockpit. The aft seems relatively intact. Carrie looks in.
94) 16) text: Carrie enters. She's still in her ECW gear.        Heart when she sees Pryce.

99) 16) dialog: Nope.

99) 48) dialog: Need any help?
99) 51) text: She sees it's Weiss' name on the tag, but something disturbing catches Carrie's eye -- it's Weiss' LEFT LEG pressing against the bag. Although the plastic is clouded, she'd swear his LEFT CALF has a LONG LINE OF STITCHES running down the side.
99) 62) dialog: (COVERING) Just thinking where it all began.
99) 70) dialog: Nothing -- I'll be right back.
100) 1) text: Carrie slips in. We've been here before -- this is where she chased Rubin.
100) 2) text: Darkness creeps in, phantom like, as the remaining daylight FADES OUT through the row of windows that run along the side. Carrie's plunged into inky black. WINTER HAS SET IN.
100) 4) text: Carrie slips in between two bookcases, trying to stay tight against the wall. Doc walks right by and out the door.
101) 1) text: Carrie enters. Turns on the light. Illuminates the lab stations, and the busted open doors of the Ready Room. Heads for the freezer.

102) 11) dialog: (to herself) Someplace no one would ever think to look.
102) 13) text: She cuts through them. Skin splits to reveal the BOTTOM OF A CANNISTER that's been stuffed inside his chest. She reaches in and pulls it out. Even has rust on the bottom. Carrie's confused -- IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OF THE CANNISTERS PRYCE SHOWED HER PHOTOS OF. It look more like THE ICE CORE CONTAINER SHE SAW AT MCMURDO.
102) 17) text: Carrie slowly stands -- the betrayal almost too much.
102) 28) dialog: And we thought it was nukes the whole time.
102) 32) dialog: How did you get wrapped up in thing, Doc?
102) 36) dialog: Then Weiss got cold feet. It got ugly, didn't it -- and Keller killed him at Delta One One. Everything went to hell after that, didn't it, Doc.
103) 1) text: Carrie carefully follows. Sees he's heading for KELLER'S ICE AXE in the ready room, that someone's removed from being wedged outside, onto the now uprighted LAB CART Pryce used to bust open the door.

103) 25) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Where you going to stuff my body too? Huh? Was I going to be five?
103) 29) text: Carrie cocks back the trigger --
103) 30) text: CARRIE (cont'd) I won't go through it again. Don't make me shoot you, please.
103) 36) dialog: Doc, your not thinking straight.
103) 43) dialog: Doc, please.
103) 44) text: Carrie crosses the room as he grabs onto the outside door's latch.
103) 54) text: Using both hands on the latch, he pulls. THE DOOR BLASTS OPEN, filling the space between Carrie and Doc with violent winds and blowing snow.
103) 55) text: Doc's throws one last look to Carrie, then takes two steps out the door.
103) 57) text: Wind and cold storm into the room against Carrie, who remains standing still like a statue. Emotionally drained. Numb. Freezing to death -- tears frozen to her cheeks.
103) 60) text: Cold to the bone, he grabs a jacket off the racket. Approaches Carrie, who remains staring at the closed door. The effects of the chill and Doc's decision apparent.
104) 3) text: Slowly widen -- to see Carrie and Pryce, kicking back on lawn chairs, side-by-side. Two heat lamps pouring out bright, warm light. A cut out piece of paper in the shape of a palm leaf is taped to one of the lamps -- throwing the shadow.
104) 10) text: Carrie lies back, rests, eyes closed.
104) 14) dialog: Hot. But there's a gentle breeze. Fiji's beautiful this time of year.
104) 19) text: Carrie turns over on her stomach -- lets the heat warm her back.
104) 21) dialog: Nah. Freedom's just a sunrise away.
