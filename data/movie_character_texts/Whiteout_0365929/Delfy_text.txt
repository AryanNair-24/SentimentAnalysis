12) 28) text: BYRON DELFY, a baby-faced, African American pilot leans out the plane's door.
12) 32) dialog: Yes, ma'am.
12) 35) text: Delfy smiles graciously.
12) 37) dialog: Brooklyn. And unless your wrinkled ass has a heart attack on my plane, I think we'll be all right.
12) 38) text: Delfy disappears back into the plane.    Doc looks to Carrie.
13) 2) text: Carrie's in the copilot's seat, wrapped up tight in her ECW, just trying to stay warm. Delfy's at the controls. Doc's in the back.
13) 6) dialog: I went to evac a camp. Had to fly off route to get around a storm. Got down low to avoid some turbulence, and there it was.
13) 12) dialog: Yeah, name's Nathan.
13) 16) dialog: Lucky he got his momma's brain. Kid's smart.
13) 20) dialog: The bonus pay. Trying to buy a house. Give my boy a yard. His own room. Stuff I never had.
13) 28) text: DELFY (cont'd) Don't like the cold, huh?
13) 32) dialog: Then why are you down here?
13) 36) text: Delfy tips the nose of the plane down. The ice below is broken by jagged hills and yawning crevasses.
13) 38) dialog: It's right up here.
13) 39) text: He spirals down among the icy hills, visibility is poor. Heavy turbulence suddenly jars the plane sideways -- Delfy laughs at Doc's nervous reaction.
13) 40) text: DELFY (cont'd) I don't carry extra panties Doc, so keep it tight. (BEAT) There it is.
13) 42) text: DELFY (cont'd) Three o'clock.
14) 1) text: The Twin Otter is in the distant background. Carrie, Doc and Delfy, who has a gear bag slung over his shoulder, weave their way around huge ice boulders -- skirt small crevasses. Mid-conversation...
14) 14) text: Delfy stops.    Grimaces.    Drops the gear bag.
14) 16) dialog: Jesus.
14) 18) text: They all stare at it - the body in unnatural angles, the spiderweb of frozen blood. Delfy looks nauseous.
14) 21) text: Delfy slowly shakes his head, no.
14) 48) text: Carrie glances to Delfy.
14) 51) dialog: Brits -- about eighty miles west.
14) 67) text: A pile of chopped ice is off to the side of corpse. Delfy, who looks very uneasy about all this, grabs the feet as Carrie and Doc each grab an arm.
14) 71) dialog: No -- this is the kind of stuff that scars you for life.
14) 76) text: Delfy turns away and pukes.
23) 3) text: Carrie and Delfy, wearing full ECW gear, lean hard into the wind, making their way towards the compound. She's carrying a duffle bag. Can barely see the Twin Otter behind them.
24) 4) dialog: (WHISPER) What's with this place?
26) 1) text: Carrie is suiting up in her ECW gear, rope harness and crampons. Her jacket's open. Delfy has a steaming cup of coffee in his hand. He looks to her gear belt; cuffs, pepper spray, baton...
26) 3) dialog: You don't carry a gun?
26) 7) dialog: Doesn't that make you feel kind of naked?
26) 12) dialog: Gettin' worse. Minus eighty-one. Wind at a hundred and ten knots.
26) 18) dialog: Give you a hand?
26) 28) dialog: Ever been on a rope-line in a whiteout?
26) 32) dialog: Yeah, hold on tight.
26) 33) text: Delfy leaves as Carrie cranks the submarine-type wheel- lock in the center of the door.
26) 36) text: CRACK! The coffee mug Delfy left on the shelf, breaks in half, exposing a cylinder of frozen coffee. It rolls across the shelf, falls, and shatters on the floor.
35) 13) dialog: Wo wo wo.   It's okay, it's okay.
35) 14) text: The figure materializes around her.     It's Delfy, holdi her down.
36) 5) dialog: When   you didn't come back -- we went   looking for you. Found a dead   guy in the other building -- that   Mooney?
36) 9) dialog: A couple hours.
36) 11) text: DELFY (cont'd) He's been looking after you.
37) 1) text: Delfy and Carrie, with her hand bandaged, both slice the dark with flashlights. She's starting to get her bearings back.
37) 3) dialog: Whoever it was, could have flown out after the storm broke.
37) 5) text: DELFY (cont'd) Who's Jack?
37) 14) dialog: Until I met you, I hadn't seen any dead people. Now I'm at two.
38) 1) text: Just as Carrie and Delfy leave the lounge, her perifocal vision picks up a wisp of light from a flashlight, which bled out from a door's threshold halfway down the hall.
38) 2) text: Delfy's eyes go wide -- Carrie's finger goes to her mouth - Shhhhh.
38) 25) text: Delfy comes up behind her.
38) 53) text: She starts to walk away -- he follows, he's not done at all. Delfy brings up the rear.
38) 77) dialog: He can, you know.
39) 1) text: Carrie and Delfy are heading toward the Ready Room. She has her phone to her ear. Two Russians trail behind with Mooney in a bodybag.
41) 1) text: Delfy's Twin Otter has landed beside the camp. There are TWO BIG TENTS and some scattered equipment - a SNOWCAT, a CHEST of TOOLS, DRUMS of GASOLINE.
41) 8) text: Carrie, Pryce and Delfy climb out from the plane and make their way toward the tents. Place looks deserted.
44) 1) text: Carrie enters with Delfy. Place is lit by a single dim bulb. This is a work space; two tables, instruments on top. Sample containers piled everywhere. Numerous photos of meteorites are stuck to a board.
44) 9) text: Delfy's drawn to a BIZARRE LOOKING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT; it's a red box on wheels with a handle like a lawn mower. A circular antennae sprouts from the front of the box.
44) 11) dialog: Looks like my dad's old lawn mower.
46) 10) text: Pryce is in the backseat, Delfy is driving. Carrie is next to him with the map and her GPS in hand. She stares at a tiny blinking red light on the GPS --
48) 1) text: Delfy's looking at Carrie like he's waiting for an answer.
48) 3) dialog: I said "which way?"
48) 63) dialog: There's nothing here.
48) 66) text: Delfy pulls to a stop.   They exit the cat.
49) 8) dialog: Maybe you wrote them down wrong.
49) 22) text: Pryce and Delfy move toward her -- each hesitating slightly, unsure of their own footing.
49) 25) text: Pryce lays flat. Reaches his hand down -- six inches too short. Delfy appears from behind.
49) 28) text: Delfy does.    Pryce inches closer.
49) 45) text: Delfy peers over Pryce's shoulder into the abyss.
49) 47) dialog: (YELLING) Marshal?
49) 51) dialog: Saw a rope in the Cat.
49) 52) text: Delfy springs to his feet.
51) 1) text: Pryce, with a flashlight in hand, lowers himself down a rope to the bottom of the shaft where Carrie waits. Delfy follows. Both take in the discovery.
52) 9) dialog: It's an Antanov-74. Russian made - - late fifties. No one's put these in the air for forty years.
52) 12) text: Delfy stands still. Staring.           Carrie throws a lo over her shoulder --
52) 15) text: She continues on with Delfy staying close.         Her li targets the cockpit door. It's closed.
53) 5) dialog: This isn't funny --
53) 6) text: She looks back to Delfy -- gets confused.
54) 1) text: Trailing her beam of light, Carrie and Delfy climb through a thick wall of nylon webbing. Enter a cluttered cargo area.
54) 3) text: Dipping into a case of bottles, Delfy pulls one free, sniffs, and drinks.
54) 6) text: Delfy grins.
54) 8) dialog: Vodka.
54) 15) text: Pryce takes a beat -- turns to she and Delfy.
54) 35) dialog: It's the Cat!
54) 44) dialog: Sonofabitch!
55) 2) text: Things are desperate as a single flashlight beam propped up on a crate, illuminates Carrie, Delfy and Pryce hard at it -- frantically chopping away at the ice filled hatch with pieces of scrap metal from the plane. Efforts are big-- but the progress minimal.
55) 9) text: Delfy looks at him with the intensity of a trapped animal.
55) 11) dialog: No way. I'm not going out like this. No way.
55) 21) text: DELFY (cont'd) And when that one goes -- we're screwed.
55) 30) text: Delfy looks to them both.    Desperate.
55) 32) dialog: Don't need my vote.
55) 35) text: Delfy moves to a nearby wooden crate. Goes to lift it, but it's frozen to the floor. Stomps on it. It breaks. Pulls pieces from the siding for torch sticks.
55) 42) text: He shines the light to the ceiling as he heads toward the back, leaving Carrie and Delfy getting swallowed in the dark.
55) 57) dialog: It'd be on the ceiling in case of an ocean landing.
55) 61) text: Carrie and Delfy get to Pryce. They follow his beam straight up to expose an ESCAPE HATCH in the roof of the fuselage.
55) 84) text: Delfy nods.
55) 92) dialog: Hallelujah --
55) 102) text: Delfy moves forward to help. The two of them push it over. It's a strenuous lift to get it on top of the other.
55) 110) dialog: Yeah -- what're you doing?
55) 121) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Delfy, cuff him to the wall.
55) 131) dialog: Man, the guy just saved our lives...
55) 134) text: Delfy takes the cuffs from her.  Cuffs Pryce to some exposed piping. Carrie lowers her gun.
55) 147) dialog: Damn, I knew that government eavesdropping was true.
56) 1) text: Delfy wriggles out from the hole. He reaches back. Helps Carrie to the surface. Pryce follows.
56) 3) text: Delfy runs over, jumps onto the CAT.   Looks inside the cab.
56) 5) dialog: Keys are still in it!
56) 14) text: Delfy starts up the Cat.
56) 32) dialog: You think Rubin might try to leave out of McMurdo?
56) 51) dialog: When we get back to the plane, I'll get ya there in forty minutes.
57) 7) text: Pryce and Delfy wait for the answer.
83) 1) text: Delfy walks across the floor. Hangar is minimally lit. Still. Silent. Void of personnel. The Otters are lined up. The Snowcats and snowmobiles on the other side. He heads toward an Otter.
84) 1) text: Delfy reaches in and gets his son's picture, which is still hanging on the console. Then, something catches his attention through the windshield of his plane. He sees a FUEL HOSE running to another plane -- and it's pumping.
84) 10) text: Keller leaps out, grabbing hold of a staggering Delfy.
84) 11) text: Ruthlessly runs him head first into a standing tool chest. Delfy collapses to the ground in a heap. Unconscious.
87) 15) text: Pryce walks under THE WING of the next plane. Spots Delfy just ahead on the ground by the tool chest. Looks like he's stirring into consciousness. Then --
87) 32) text: Carrie dashes to Pryce. Sees Delfy get to his feet. Face bloody. He moves to Pryce.
87) 39) text: She gets over to the guys quickly, giving Delfy a visual once over. He'll be fine, but things look bad for Pryce. He's bleeding profusely.
87) 41) text: Delfy looks to the hangar doors, which are nearly open.
87) 50) text: CARRIE (cont'd) Damn it! (to Delfy) Come on. We're getting him up.
88) 2) text: Carrie grabs Delfy's hands. Puts them directly on the bloody wound. Surprisingly, he stays focused.
88) 6) dialog: It won't stop!
88) 7) text: Looks Delfy right in the eye.
88) 36) text: Carrie doesn't wait for an answer.     Gives Delfy the tw way.
94) 1) text: Delfy, along with Murphy and his two guys, carry Pryce in. Doc's in the back room with two others, loading the BODYBAGS onto a cart.
94) 8) text: They usher him onto one. He looks to Delfy who still has his hand on Pryce's wound.
94) 11) dialog: I know, I know, he'll die!
