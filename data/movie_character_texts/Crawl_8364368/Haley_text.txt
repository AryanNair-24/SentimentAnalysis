1) 0) text: Someone GROANS. A LUMP shifts under a huge comforter. A slender hand reaches out, searching the nightstand. A CHARM BRACELET dangles from the wrist. The same young woman, HALEY (19) pokes her head out from under the covers. Hung over. Bleary-eyed. She finds her phone. Checks the display -- BETH. Takes a breath. Answers with a wrecked voice.
1) 1) dialog: H-hello?
2) 0) text: Haley's older sister BETH (26) is on the other end of the line. She’s at the sink doing dishes. Wearing workout clothes. Looks like her day began a while ago.
2) 3) dialog: What time is it?
2) 6) dialog: Yeah. I might have overdone it a little. A glimpse of her lean athletic build as she pulls on a tank top. Slips into a pair of shorts.
2) 7) dialog: What's up?
2) 9) text: She's been trying to reach him since last night. Apparently he’s not answering his phone. Haley shuffles into her KITCHENETTE. Opens a cabinet. Pours herself a bowl of cereal. Eating it dry. Breakfast of Champions.
2) 10) dialog: So she called you? To call me?
2) 12) dialog: She has it.
2) 14) dialog: Come on, Beth. I’m not gonna be BFF’s with my dad’s new girlfriend. (beat) Where is she anyway? Why can’t she do it?
2) 16) dialog: I thought that was gonna miss us?
3) 3) dialog: Sounds like you've got your hands full.
3) 5) dialog: Yeah. Well there’s nothing I love more than spending my Saturday driving an hour out of my way to check on dear ol’ dad.
3) 7) dialog: I think he’s having a mid-life crisis. Have you seen his new earring? He looks like a pirate. And not a sexy, Johnny-Depp-type pirate. (MORE )
3) 10) dialog: Okay, I’m going.
3) 12) dialog: Uh huh. I’11 call you when I get there. Bye. Haley hangs up. Scans through some pics on her phone. Finds a recent SELFIE with her DAD. His arm lovingly wrapped around his daughter’s shoulder. He’s in his 40’s. Tanned from working outdoors. Ruggedly handsome, although Haley would never admit it. She annotates his earring and sketches an eyepatch over his left eye. Attaches the photo. Adding a caption: Arrr! Sends it to Beth. Haley finishes her cereal. A moment later, her phone DINGS. A reply from her sister: Oh, boy. Haley smiles. Pulls on a varsity sweatshirt. Then grabs her keys and dons a pair of sunglasses.
4) 1) text: Haley drives. Windows down. Wind in her hair. The car radio’s playing Lana Del Rey's YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL. She sings along, tapping the steering wheel.
6) 0) text: Haley's Outback arrives at its destination. Pulling into the driveway of a modest suburban home.
7) 0) text: KEYS in the lock. The front door opens. Haley steps inside.
7) 1) dialog: Anybody home? She's greeted by a big GOLDEN RETRIEVER.
7) 2) dialog: Hey, Roscoe. Where’s Dad, huh? Where is he? The dog is jumping all over her. Like he hasn’t seen her in ages. Haley grabs him. Brings him in for a big hug.
7) 3) dialog: Oh, I know. I’ve missed you too. He pulls away. Running to the back door. Seems really desperate. Barking. She lets him out. Wanders into the living room.
7) 4) dialog: Dad! Continues through the house. Searching the different rooms. No sign of him. She heads upstairs.
7) 5) text: Haley TAPS on the bedroom door. Pokes her head in. With no one around, she decides to do a little snooping. Rifles through a nearby dresser. Haley finds a box of PHOTOGRAPHS in the bottom drawer. Thumbs through them. Images of Haley and Beth with their mother MAGGIE at different ages. They’re an active trio. Hiking. Camping. Running marathons. She settles on an older SNAPSHOT of her mother from when she was in college. Haley gets a little misty-eyed. Blinks away the tears.
8) 0) text: Haley pulls open the fridge and grabs a Gatorade. Her phone pressed against her ear. Waiting as it rings. Beth answers.
8) 1) dialog: Well I’m at the house, but Dad’s not here. Haley notices some ODDLY PATTERNED CURTAINS that seem to clash with the surrounding decor.
8) 2) dialog: And it looks like Katie’s been redecorating.
8) 4) dialog: (laughs) Something like that. How was yoga?
8) 8) dialog: (eyes welling) Just been looking at some pictures of Mom. Wipes away the tears.
8) 9) dialog: Sometimes something'1ll happen at school, and I'll pick up the phone to call her. (then) It's not fair.
8) 11) dialog: Katie's fine. It's just... she tries too hard.
8) 13) dialog: I know. Don't get me wrong. I’m happy for him. (MORE )
8) 15) dialog: I wish you were down here.
9) 0) text: Haley's Outback is back on the road. Crossing over a series of swampy canals. DARK STORM CLOUDS roll in on the horizon.
10) 0) text: Haley is at the wheel. Downing the Gatorade as she drives. Nursing her hangover. She checks the address on her phone. Then looks up at the visor. That SNAPSHOT of her mom is now clipped there. Watching over her.
11) 0) text: Haley's Outback passes a weathered sign: CORAL LAKE DEVELOPMENT.
12) 0) text: As Haley searches the empty subdivision, her phone RINGS. She answers it.
12) 2) dialog: Not yet. I just got here. This place is creepy. Where is everybody? 10. She cruises the quiet streets. Passing houses in various stages of construction.
12) 4) dialog: Well I better find him fast. That Gatorade went right through me. I have to pee so bad.
12) 6) dialog: Hold on. I see his truck. (then) If he’s in one of these houses kicked back watching the game, I am not gonna be happy.
12) 8) dialog: I will. Right after I pee. The sisters share a laugh. Haley disconnects.
13) 0) text: Haley pulls up behind the pickup truck. KELLER CONSTRUCTION is stenciled on the side. She kills the engine. Climbs out. And looks around. A half dozen finished MODEL HOMES line the street. The yards are overgrown. Suburbia gone to seed. 11. A gust of wind carries an empty trash can across the road. It rolls onto the curb. Haley sets the alarm on her car. It CHIRPS. Headlights blink. The wind is picking up. A few drops of rain. She quickly cuts across the lawn.
14) 0) text: Haley climbs up onto the front steps. A digital lockbox hangs from the doorknob. She KNOCKS. No answer. Pushes it open.
15) 0) text: Haley steps inside. Closing the door. A cavernous entryway. The interior is dim and gloomy.
15) 1) dialog: (calling out) Hello? Listens. The house is completely quiet. Just the sound of the WIND blowing outside. She reaches for a light switch. Flips it. Nothing. Her FOOTSTEPS echo on the tile floor.
15) 2) dialog: Dad? You in here? Haley's doing a little “pee dance.” Can't hold it any longer. Searches for the nearest bathroom. She finds a windowless half bath just off the entryway. Flicks the light switch. Nothing happens. No choice. Has to leave the door ajar. 12.
16) 0) text: Haley sits on the toilet in the darkness. She hears a odd muffled SCRAPING sound. Looks out the open door.
16) 1) dialog: Hello...? Another SCRAAAAPE. It's faint. Far off. She quickly finishes.
17) 0) text: The FLUSH of a toilet. Haley steps out. Buttoning her shorts. Listens. The sound has stopped. Must just be the wind.
18) 0) text: Haley wanders through the rooms. Calling for her dad. The house has a sprawling floor plan. She spots hairline cracks in the walls, hinting at some structural damage. The interior has been stripped. Cables hanging from a mount where a television once was.
18) 1) dialog: Well at least they took the TV.
19) 1) dialog: What a mess. 13. Haley steps up into an equally damaged DINING ROOM. The floor is soaked and warping. Tools lie in the corner where the wood is rotting. Among them a SLEDGEHAMMER and CROWBAR. Swears she can hear VOICES. Far off. The WIND picks up outside. RATTLING the windows. A WHISTLING sound. Haley follows it to the sliding glass door. It’s open just a crack.
20) 0) text: Haley steps out onto the patio. A large in-ground swimming pool. Three-quarters full with murky water. Some empty beer cans floating on the surface. Beyond the pool is a LARGE MAN-MADE LAKE. Palm trees are swaying in the wind. Out on the gulf, the sky has turned menacingly dark. A couple of flashes of lightning. The yard is overgrown. Swampy looking. Moss hanging from the foliage.
20) 1) dialog: Dad...? Marco...? Polo...? Anybody...? The rain picks up. A sudden downpour.
21) 0) text: Haley ducks back inside. Slides the door closed and locks it. Hears the rain PELTING the house. She removes her phone. Dials her dad’s number. Waits as it connects. The silence is broken by a faint musical RINGTONE. 14. A muffled song. If you were born in the 70's, you might recognize it. A cheesy pop song from the early 80's called ESCAPE. “If you like pina coladas and getting caught in the rain...” She rolls her eyes. Shakes her head.
21) 1) dialog: (mutters to herself) Dad, you have got to update that ringtone. Haley lowers the phone. Follows the sound through the house. Into a massive --
22) 0) text: Haley finds her dad's TOOLBOX sitting on the floor. Reaches in and pulls out his RINGING phone. She's getting warmer. The SONG stops as the call goes to voicemail. On her own phone, Haley can hear her dad's RECORDED MESSAGE.
22) 3) dialog: (to herself) Dad, you are not making this easy. She looks around. Now, how to get down there.
23) 0) text: Haley moves back through the rear of the house. Checking the different rooms for an access hatch.
24) 0) text: Haley passes through an empty laundry room. In a darkened corner, a gas water heater KICKS on. Scaring the hell out of her. She collects herself. Continues her search.
25) 0) text: Haley enters a large two-car garage at the back of the house. The garage door has been propped up a few feet. Letting in the elements. Looks like it's been that way for a while. The floor is covered in mud and debris. Haley activates the light on her phone. Panning the cavernous garage. Spots an open storage closet. 16.
25) 1) text: The interior is unfinished. Exposed drywall. There's a hole in the floor. The cover, a loose piece of plywood, sits off to the side. Haley looks down into the hatch opening. It leads into the CRAWL SPACE running beneath the house. She can hear that muffled RADIO. It's definitely coming from down there. Haley aims her phone’s light into the darkness. Illuminating the vast crawl space. Dark and dank. The beam of light barely penetrates the gloom. She calls out.
25) 2) dialog: Dad? Are you down there? Haley waits. No answer.
26) 0) text: Haley awkwardly lowers herself into the hole and squeezes under. There’s just enough clearance for her to squat-crawl without getting dirty. She points the phone’s light in front of her. A better look at the underbelly of the house. Takes a deep breath. Heading toward the MUSIC.
26) 1) dialog: (mutters to herself) Can't believe I'm doing this. Haley makes her way through a maze of wooden support posts that carry the load of the house overhead. 17. After twenty feet, the clearance drops some. She hesitates. Calls again.
26) 2) dialog: Dad?! Haley crouches down. Now crawling forward on her hands and knees.
26) 3) dialog: Wish I’d worn some jeans. She worms her way through the tight space. Scanning with her light. The MUSIC is getting louder. She’s moving in the right direction. The beam picks out cobwebs. Growing mold. There's a lot of water damage down here. Heavy-duty pipes run along the ceiling of the space. Covered in condensation. Dripping.
26) 4) dialog: (sarcastic, mimicking Beth’s voice) Hey, sis, do me a favor. Go check on Dad. It’ll be fun... The shadows cast by the plumbing and support posts shift as she moves. The effect is slightly disorienting. And very unsettling. The darkness could be hiding anything. A FLASH of lightning outside filters in through a SERIES OF VENTS along the edge of the foundation. Giving us a brief glimpse of the surroundings. It’s a mess down here. Exposed dirt and rock. Hanging insulation. Shredded vapor barrier. The muffled RUMBLE of thunder. As Haley inches along, her sweatshirt snags on something. The tip of a RUSTY NAIL digs into her skin. 18.
26) 5) dialog: ow! She flinches. Pulls free. Inspects her shoulder. Sees that she’s bleeding a little.
26) 6) dialog: Shit. Hope my tetanus shot is up to date. Haley continues through the cramped environment. The beam of the phone’s light plays off -- A couple of large, cobwebbed TRAP CAGES. Placed down here a while ago to capture unwanted animal intruders. Possibly raccoons. And then forgotten. The RADIO echoes from the darkness. Haley rounds a support post. Squeezing past some DUCTWORK. She reacts to a strange SCRAPING sound. Just like she heard before up in the bathroom. Only now, it's a lot closer. Coming from somewhere in the shadows behind her. She stops to listen. Looks back over her shoulder. Points her phone’s light toward the sound.
26) 7) dialog: Dad...? Her eyes scan the space. Nothing there. Just a maze of supports and twisting pipes. The SCRAPING has stopped. Haley is starting to feel slightly uneasy. 19. She continues her search. Behind her, a LARGE DARK SHAPE slips past! Blocking out the daylight from the open access hatch. For just a moment. Then it’s gone. Haley pushes deeper. Oblivious. Her phone’s light sweeps the darkness. Dust particles hang in the air. She catches a whiff of something putrid. The smell of rot. Haley clears another support and finally finds the source of the music -- A PORTABLE AM/FM RADIO lying on its side in the damp dirt. Near the water shutoff. No sign of Dad. Then she sees a BLOODY HANDPRINT on a nearby support. A dark BLOOD TRAIL in the dirt. Stretching into the shadows. Haley GASPS, realizing something is terribly wrong.
26) 8) dialog: 
26) 10) dialog: Dad, it’s Haley. Where are you? Passing a dropped PIPE WRENCH. A shredded TOOL BELT. Another BLOODY HANDPRINT on a support. She encounters a NETWORK OF TWISTING PIPES. Gets flat on her stomach and squeezes under. There's a little more clearance on this side of the plumbing. She sits up. 20. In the distance, she can make out the DARK OUTLINE of a body lying in the dirt.
26) 11) dialog: Oh God, no... She quickly crawls forward. Her phone casts a light on her DAD. Face down. Motionless. Haley turns him over. His shirt is drenched in blood. She shakes him. Trying to revive him. Tears streaking her cheeks.
26) 12) dialog: Dad! Wake up. He COUGHS and GROANS. Still alive. Haley’s overwhelmed with relief. Her dad’s eyes open halfway.
26) 14) dialog: No. It's Haley. He’s listless. Fading in and out. Eyes struggling to focus.
26) 15) dialog: It's okay. I'm here. What happened? She uses the phone’s light to get a better look. His left arm is mangled. Covered in puncture marks. Bleeding badly. She inspects the injury.
26) 16) dialog: What the hell did this? His other hand is still clutching his flashlight. It’s turned off. 21. Haley gently takes it from him. Frantically checks her phone. No SIGNAL.
26) 17) dialog: shit. Her dad’s mind is slowly clearing. Looks up at his daughter.
26) 19) dialog: (with a sense of urgency) We've got to get you out of here. A sudden look of panic fills his eyes. Struggling to get the words out.
26) 22) dialog: Not without you. Haley glances back in the direction she came. The light of the OPEN ACCESS HATCH is a long way off. Barely visible through all the looming pipes and supports. 22. As she begins to move her dad, he winces. CRIES OUT in pain. Haley sees that his right leg is twisted at an odd angle. She probes the surface of his jeans just below the knee. Another anguished CRY. His leg must be broken. She looks around but can’t find anything to splint it. Haley checks her phone again for a signal. Still nothing. Shoves it in her pocket.
26) 23) dialog: Dad, this is gonna hurt, but we need to move you. She reaches under his arms and begins pulling him with all her strength. Her dad grits his teeth. GROANS as Haley drags him back.
26) 24) dialog: I know. I’m so sorry. The pain is too much. He passes out. Haley tries to keep it together and not panic. She’s never seen her dad hurt before. He’s always been the strong one. She continues. Inching him along. It’s painfully slow. Difficult to get enough leverage in this tight space. Haley reaches that low network of pipes. Now what? Somehow needs to get him under. She checks the makeshift bandage on her dad’s arm. It’s helped slow the bleeding. Makes sure the knots are still tight. As she works, she senses something moving out in the darkness. Hears that familiar SCRRRAAPING... 23. It's getting closer... A low BELLOW. Her heart catching in her throat. Haley turns in the direction of the sound. Fishes the phone from her pocket. Switching on the light. Scanning the shadows. WHAM! The JAWS OF AN ALLIGATOR EXPLODE from the darkness.
26) 25) text: SNAPPING closed just inches from Haley. She SCREAMS. Scrambling back. SLAMS her head into a low-hanging beam. Dropping the phone. Haley's dazed. Ears RINGING. Struggling to focus. The HUGE REPTILE pulls back into the shadows. A stunned beat. Haley's still in shock. Then -- The creature SMASHES into the pipes again. A nightmarish glimpse of its hideous teeth as it bites down. Another near miss. Haley gets her bearings. Grabs her dad. Desperately pulling him back in the other direction. Away from the attacking REPTILE. The animal THRASHES wildly. Trying to wedge itself through a gap in the pipes. But as hard as it tries, the huge creature can’t get any closer. It GROWLS in frustration. Spins away. Giving us a glimpse of its MASSIVE FORM. Haley turns back. Makes a grab for her phone. Reaching it just as -- 24. The reptile's long tail SWEEPS beneath the pipes. Knocking the phone away. Haley hears it CLATTER out into the darkness. As the REPTILE retreats back into the shadows. SCRAPING across the ground as it moves off. She turns her attention to her dad. He's semi-conscious.
26) 26) dialog: Dad, stay with me. She finds his flashlight. Clicks it on. Checks the shadows surrounding them. Worried that thing will find another way in. There’s a low-hanging section of the subfloor running perpendicular to the pipes. Must be the sunken living room. A RUSTLE of movement on the other side. She sees the reptile’s long body SLITHER past. That low-hanging section is forming a protective barrier. Her dad starts COUGHING. Lips parched. Haley looks around. Finds a leftover piece of her sweatshirt. Holds it under a dripping pipe. Letting the fabric become saturated. She moves it to her dad’s lips. Wrings out the water. He gulps it down. Haley does it again. Nursing her dad back. He’s slowly coming out of it. Swallows. Looks at his daughter. She gently strokes his face.
26) 27) dialog: Are you okay? Her dad nods weakly. 25.
26) 28) dialog: How did that thing get down here? He’s slightly hoarse. Still trying to find his voice.
26) 32) dialog: Katie got worried when you didn’t answer your phone.
26) 34) dialog: Yeah. Something like that. Haley remembers the energy bar. Fishes it from her pocket. Peels back the wrapper.
26) 35) dialog: Here. Eat this. He takes a bite.
26) 38) dialog: Dad, this is bad. We have to get you to a hospital. Haley looks toward the open hatch. Knows the reptile is somewhere nearby.
26) 39) dialog: I need to find my phone. So we can call for help.
26) 41) dialog: I can make it.
26) 43) dialog: What do we do then? Just wait here? Her dad reaches out toward his daughter. She takes his rough, calloused hand. Gives hima reassuring look.
26) 44) dialog: I'll be right back. He’s too weak to stop her. Tears in her eyes.
26) 45) dialog: Stay here. Okay? 27. He forces a smile.
26) 47) dialog: (quietly to herself) You can do this. Swallows her fear. Carefully squeezes beneath the pipes. Moving out. Haley creeps toward her phone. Following the dim light. Never stops scanning the darkness. Breathing hard. Her heart in her throat. She’s halfway there. Can still see the reptile’s DARK OUTLINE guarding that OPEN HATCH. Keeps going. Finds her phone. It’s slipped beneath a slightly raised DRAIN PIPE. Just out of reach. 28. She pushes her hand under. Through gritted teeth.
26) 48) dialog: Come... on... Haley flattens herself. Reaching deeper. Stretching... Touching it. All the while keeping an eye on the alligator in the distance. She gets hold. Pulling the phone toward her. Yanks it out. Haley switches off the phone’s light. Looks back toward the hatch. The animal hasn’t moved. The display is covered in mud. She quickly tries to wipe it off. There's a signal. It’s weak. But it’s there. Holds the phone up toward the subfloor. Getting an extra bar of reception.
26) 49) dialog: Yes. Haley dials 9-1-1. Anxiously waits as it rings...
26) 50) dialog: (softly) C’mon. C’mon. Pick up! Haley looks back toward the garage access hatch. The reptile is gone!
26) 51) dialog: shit. 29. Her eyes nervously study the shadows. She’s trying not to panic. An OPERATOR finally answers. A broken connection.
26) 53) dialog: (keeping her voice low) Help. You need to help us.
26) 55) dialog: We're trapped. Under a house. There’s an alligator -- A RUSTLE of movement catches Haley’s attention. She reacts as -- The REPTILE creeps into view on the other side of that DRAIN PIPE. Just a few feet away. Haley SCREAMS! Frantically crab crawls backwards as -- The animal CLIMBS over the pipe. She flips onto her stomach. Scrambling on hands and knees through the dark space. Trying to get back to her dad. The reptile follows. Closing in fast. Lunges -- Jaws CLAMPING down on her left leg! Teeth tearing into flesh. Haley CRIES out in pain! Tries to kick free. The animal THRASHES. Dragging her back. Huge mouth locked onto her lower leg. It yanks Haley further into the shadows. Swinging her around like a rag doll. SLAMS her into a support post. Knocking the wind out of her. 30.
26) 56) dialog: Ugh! The impact sends the phone flying. Haley's dazed. Bleeding from a gash in her forehead. Her fingernails clawing at the ground. Arms flailing, grasping for a handhold. The reptile pulls. Twisting its head. Hauling her back through the darkness. It’s ferocious. Brutal. Haley has to act fast. Catches one of the vertical supports. She hangs on for dear life. Arms wrapped around the post. Fighting each horrible pull. A tug of war. Haley SCREAMS in pain. Her hands start slipping off the support post. The reptile thrashing wildly. Trying to break her grip. Haley kicks it with her free leg. Jamming the heel of her sneaker into its snout. Again and again. Trying to get loose.
26) 57) dialog: 
26) 60) dialog: No time to respond. The reptile rears back. HITS it again. Driving the cage and Haley back another couple of feet. But Haley hangs on. Using all her strength to keep the cage between her and the raging animal. The reptile SNARLS in frustration. Lashing against the metal. Jaws clamping onto the wire mesh. It backs up with the edge of the cage in its mouth. Dragging Haley with it. 32. The cage snags on a support post. The reptile lets go. Trying to move around it. But Haley keeps the cage between them. It retreats a few feet. Gets a running start. Haley quickly spins the cage around. So the opening is pointed toward the charging animal. The alligator SMASHES into the front of the cage. Its snout punching through the trap's gate. Its narrow head now wedged inside. The reptile is wearing the cage like a wire muzzle. This only seems to make it madder. The animal THRASHES around wildly. Swinging its huge head side-to-side. Knocking the cage into the surrounding supports. Trying to work it off. Giving Haley a chance to scramble away. The wire cage RATTLES as the reptile tears at it from inside. Gnashing its teeth. As Haley flees, she becomes entangled in a mass of electrical wires hanging down from the ceiling of the crawl space. The reptile finally manages to get free. Flinging the cage aside. The barrier between them gone. Fuck! She's exposed. Haley tugs at the twisting wires. Ripping them free from the staples holding them in place overhead. A low menacing BELLOW. The reptile’s advancing. 33. Slows down... Sees that she’s stuck. Like a fly trapped in a spider web.
26) 61) dialog: No! Haley desperately worms her way through. Using every ounce of her strength. Gets loose. Crawling out the other side. The reptile follows. Tangling itself up in the same mess of hanging wires. Slowing the animal’s progress. Haley can hear it STRUGGLING behind her. She kicks with her good leg. Pushing herself forward. Ignoring the pain. The reptile rips free from the wires. SCRAPING along the ground. Crawling after her. It lunges. Jaws SNAPPING down. Just missing her. The reptile makes another snatch at Haley. Overshoots. CRASHING into a support. Haley flattens herself, squeezing under a gap near the foundation. The reptile tries to follow. But the clearance is too low. It can’t open its mouth enough to grab her. Haley rolls out of the way. Taking shelter behind a couple of four inch pipes running horizontal to the ground. A small pocket of space here. The pipes on one side of her. The foundation wall on the other. Haley catches her breath. Collapsing back against the concrete. Exhausted. In intense pain. 34. Sees that MONSTROUS BEAST pacing along on the other side of the pipes. Its tail SCRRRAAPING the ground. The REPTILE turns. Its eye is right there! Looking in at her through the pipes. Another low menacing BELLOW. It suddenly spins away. Haley's attention remains fixed on the reptile as it slinks back into the darkness. The SCRRRRAAAAPING sound fades off. Haley tries to get her breathing under control. Her whole body trembling. Happy to be alive. Her dad anxiously calls from the shadows. His VOICE far off.
26) 63) dialog: (yelling back, breathless) Dad. I'm okay. Stay there. She removes the flashlight from her waistband. Switches it on. Scanning it over her leg. Inspecting the damage. It’s riddled with puncture marks. Blood running down her calf.
26) 64) dialog: shit. She applies pressure to the injury. Searches for something to stop the bleeding. Sets the flashlight down. 35. Rips off pieces of VAPOR BARRIER. Haley grits her teeth. Wrapping the meshed material around her wounded leg. CRYING OUT as she ties it off. It's like doing surgery in a closet. Haley inspects her makeshift tourniquet. The bleeding has stopped. For now. She takes a moment to gather her strength. The pain visible on her face. Picks up the flashlight. Examines the narrow space. Listens... Just the sound of that far-off RADIO and the STORM outside. WIND and RAIN lashing the house.
26) 65) dialog: Dad...? She sees a chalky water line halfway up the foundation wall. Indicating that at one point this crawl space was flooded. And a reminder that it could happen again.
26) 67) dialog: Hold on. I think I found something. Haley crawls toward it. Dragging her damaged leg. Creeping along the foundation. Finds one of those VENTS set into the concrete. Narrow slats allowing for air flow. But not much else. The opening is tight, but if she can get the cover off, maybe she can squeeze through. 36.
26) 68) dialog: Dad, there’s a vent. I’m gonna see if I can get out. Haley kicks at the vent cover with her good leg. Again and again.
26) 69) dialog: C’mon... c’mon... Gives it a final frustrated kick. The cover’s not budging. It’s bolted into the concrete foundation from outside.
26) 70) dialog: Dammit! She looks out through the vent’s narrow slats.
26) 74) dialog: I don’t know. I can see an air conditioning unit. And some of the street.
26) 76) dialog: Okay. So how do I get there?
26) 79) dialog: Wet wall?
26) 81) dialog: Dad, I don’t know where the alligator went. Can you see it? Her dad hears MOVEMENT in the distance. Squints into the gloom. Sees a FAINT OUTLINE of the reptile slinking beneath the garage.
26) 83) dialog: Studies the darkness one more time just to make sure. Clicks off the flashlight.
26) 84) dialog: Okay. (under her breath) Here goes. Haley begins moving along the foundation wall. Feeling her way through the darkness. Using her good leg to push her along.
28) 5) dialog: Sneaks along the front of the house. Keeps the flashlight off. Doesn’t want to give away her position. She studies the pipes. They all seem to be converging at the same point overhead. That must be the wet wall. Haley moves away from the foundation. Rolling onto her back. Looking up at the subfloor. Tries to orientate herself. Searching for that second access hatch. She suddenly spots it. Cut into the floorboards overhead. There’s a DARK CLUSTER hanging near the front edge of the hatch. Haley brushes it away. Unknowingly waking -- A large nest of HARVESTMEN SPIDERS that have made this damp crawl space their home. Hundreds of LONG-LEGGED SPIDERS drop from overhead.
28) 6) text: Falling into Haley’s hair. Onto her face. She's FREAKING OUT. Writhing wildly. Trying to shake them off. Fighting the urge to scream. Has to keep her mouth closed. 40. They crawl all over her... Scattering off into the shadows. Haley desperately swipes away the stragglers. Collects herself. A shudder of disgust.
28) 7) dialog: (mutters to herself) I fucking hate spiders. She nervously glances back over her shoulder. Checking for the reptile. Then hits up against the hatch. Dust and dirt filters down from above with each impact. But the cover won't budge. Haley grits her teeth. Quietly shoulders it up. Pushing with all her might.
28) 8) text: Boxes of unused ceramic tiles are piled on top of the hatch. They shift slightly as Haley pushes up from below.
29) 0) text: Haley repositions herself to get more leverage. Straining. Pushing with everything she’s got. Inching the cover up. The hatch door rises a few inches. Then catches. Something’s preventing it from opening any further. Haley, struggling to keep it up, works her fingers through the gap. 41. CLOSE ON HALEY’S FINGERS Feeling along the edge. Finding a metal hasp. A SQUARE PADLOCK holding it in place.
29) 1) dialog: Pulling her hand back. A defeated breath. She lets the hatch drop. Slumps back against a wooden support. Their chance of escape slipping away. A long, quiet beat. Thinking of her dad. Shakes it off.
29) 2) dialog: Come on, Haley. Keep it together. (then, calling out) Dad...?!
29) 5) dialog: Dad? I can’t get it open. It’s locked. What should I do? He tries to hide his disappointment.
29) 7) dialog: A beat. She’s thinking. 42. A FLASH of lightning spills in through the foundation vents. Giving Haley an idea.
29) 8) dialog: I’m gonna try prying off another vent cover. Maybe one of them is loose.
29) 11) dialog: Isn't giving up. She cautiously makes her way through the darkness toward the edge of the house. Searching for the nearest vent. She stops. Listens. Hears a faint BUZZING. Off to her left. Her PHONE. It’s VIBRATING somewhere in the shadows. Haley shifts directions. Moving quietly. Trying to follow the sound.
29) 14) dialog: Finds herself in an area sectioned off by large pieces of ROTTING INSULATION. They hang down from the ceiling like Spanish moss. Obscuring her view. She’s busy searching the ground around her. Puddles everywhere.
29) 15) dialog: Dad, hold on. I can hear my phone.
29) 17) dialog: Crawling for her life. The hanging insulation giving her cover.
29) 18) text: She slips on the muddy surface. SLAMMING her damaged leg into a support. Ugh! Hurts like hell. Haley recovers. Keeps going. Taking shelter behind another large post. Hears the RUSTLE of movement. More hanging insulation shifts nearby. She holds her breath as -- The REPTILE stalks past. On the prowl. It lingers a moment. Then keeps going. The SCRRRRAAAPING sound moves off. It’s lost her in the darkness. Haley tries to remain silent. A long, quiet beat. Then -- The phone into her pocket suddenly BUZZES with a message. The REPTILE whips around. Honing in on the sound. And on Haley. Shit! She takes off. Scrambling furiously. Survival instinct kicking in. Ignoring her wounded leg. Heart pounding out of her chest. Making her way toward a LONG, RECTANGULAR METAL DUCT running along the top of the crawl space. Less than a foot of clearance beneath it. Haley crawls desperately. Moving through standing water. Sensing the REPTILE closing in right behind her. She dives for the duct. It's a tight fit. Manages to squeeze most of her body under -- 45. But her RIGHT SNEAKER snags on a metal edge. Haley quickly works to unhook it. Can’t get it loose. Yanks off her shoe. Pulling her bare foot under. Emerging on the other side -- Into a narrow passageway between the duct and the house's foundation. Haley falls back against the concrete. Catches her breath. Shaking. She checks her pocket for the phone. It’s not there! Must have slipped out during her mad dash. Haley looks back under. Sees the phone lying just on the other side of the duct. As she reaches for it -- A huge claw comes CRASHING down! CRUSHING the phone into the mud. Shattering the display.
29) 19) dialog: (lost) No... Haley pulls back. Devastated. Hugging her knees to her chest. Her last chance to call for help now gone. She can hear the reptile furiously CLAWING on the other side of the duct. Ripping at the vapor barrier. It lunges into the gap. Trying to burrow its way under. Not enough room. The alligator backs out. Giving Haley a chance to catch her breath. Now what? 46. An anxious beat -- The REPTILE SLAMS its weight into the metal surface from the other side. The loud THUMP shakes the duct. Causing Haley to jump. Another HIT. The sound is deafening. And another. The bolts mounting the duct to the joists overhead SNAP. One after another. A section of the ductwork breaks free. SPLASHING down into the muddy water. The REPTILE continues POUNDING against the surface. The whole structure now sliding. The space on Haley’s side is slowly collapsing.
29) 21) dialog: (under her breath, through gritted teeth) A little busy... right now... Feeling each impact from the powerful animal. The POUNDING stops. A tense beat. Her worried dad continues calling.
29) 22) dialog: (yelling back) Dad, I’m alright! Hold on. The silence is suddenly broken by that dreaded wet SCRRRRAAAPING on the other side. 47. The REPTILE is on the move again. SCRATCHING against the duct as it crawls. Where’s it going? Haley clicks on the flashlight. Looks down the length of the passageway. Sees that, after twenty feet, the duct ends. Turning up into the house. Just then the BEAST rounds the corner. Eyes reflecting red in the beam of her flashlight. Blocking that end of the passageway. Oh, shit! Haley turns and frantically heads in the opposite direction. Hears SCRATCHING and SPLASHING behind her as the reptile slowly pushes itself between the duct and the foundation wall. It’s tail BANGING against the metal as it moves. Up ahead, the duct bends to the right. Haley scrambles around the corner -- Reaching a DEAD END. The opening is sealed off with plywood. She’s cornered. Looks back. Sees the alligator closing in. But Haley’s not ready to give up. Kicks wildly at the flimsy plywood. Manages to knock one side loose. Haley squeezes out. Wedging the plywood back into place just as -- The REPTILE thrusts its snout sideways through the gap. Getting it caught between the bending duct and the edge of the plywood. Haley pushes with all her weight against the plywood. 48. The animal is trapped. Pulling back. Trying to escape. Its broad snout just inches from Haley. SNARLING and HISSING. Struggling to get free. Haley can’t hold it much longer. Sees a NARROW OPENING in the foundation. Several yards away. She lets up on the plywood just as -- The animal gives a hard backward yank. Slipping back behind the duct. Haley dives for that narrow opening. Rolling onto her side. Presses herself through the tight entrance -- Into a concrete CUBBYHOLE. A recessed portion of the crawl space. The size of a walk-in closet. Haley backs up. The ground is very muddy and wet back here. She finds a piece of rebar lying on the muck. Grabs it for protection. Gripping it tight. Clicks off the flashlight.
29) 24) dialog: Can hear the animal SNIFFING close by. Raspy BREATHING. Then a long, low guttural GROWL. The reptile looms outside the narrow entrance. Staring in. Knows she’s there. Just out of reach.
29) 25) text: Haley’s fed up. Thrusts the end of the rebar out the opening. JAMMING it into the reptile’s snout. The creature retreats slightly.
29) 26) dialog: Go away! Get out of here! Haley winces in pain. Inspects her damaged leg. She’s bleeding through the tourniquet. Redresses it. CRIES OUT as she tightens the knots.
29) 28) dialog: Hears the reptile creeping back toward the narrow opening. She clicks on the flashlight. Points it directly at the beast. Shining the blinding beam into its eyes. The alligator GROWLS irritated. Backing away. Sensitive to the bright light.
29) 29) dialog: That's right. Get your slimy ass out of here! The reptile keeps backing up. Moving into the shadows. Out of the beam’s reach. Haley detects a RUSTLE of movement behind her. Looks over her shoulder. A RABBIT hops into view. Just a few feet away. A Cottontail. Nose wiggling wildly. It’s made this corner of the crawl space its home. 51. Haley freezes. Not wanting to scare it. The rabbit pauses. Motionless. Its black eyes staring back at her.
29) 30) dialog: (whispers) Don’t worry. I’m not gonna hurt you. The frightened animal suddenly darts off. Scurrying for the entrance.
29) 31) dialog: No... Haley makes a desperate grab for it.
29) 32) dialog: ---don't... But she’s too late. It slips through her hands. Fleeing out the narrow opening. Into the open crawl space. The reptile STRIKES. Lunging from the shadows. It's fast and vicious. Huge jaws SNAPPING down on the unsuspecting rabbit. Teeth chomping and grinding. It's over in seconds. The alligator turns toward Haley. Eyes reflecting a deep red in the low light. Finishes chewing. A bloody grin. It’s taunting her. Haley YELLS in frustration.
29) 33) dialog: 
29) 35) dialog: So that’s how your mommy got in here. She considers her options. Can’t push them out there. They’1ll drown. And she can’t leave them here. Haley quickly packs the hole with insulation. Trying to stop the water from coming in. Slows it to a trickle. Then she scoops up the young bunnies. Wraps them in her tank top. Holding them close to her chest. Moves toward that opening. She CLICKS on the flashlight. Looks out into the empty crawl space. The alligator appears to have moved off. Haley turns off the flashlight. And, armed with that piece of rebar, carefully creeps out. 53. She's cradling the bunnies. Trying to move quietly. Eyes searching for the reptile.
29) 38) dialog: Notices that the MUSIC from the radio has stopped. An eerie silence. Can’t call to her dad. Too worried she’ll give away her location to that reptile. She hugs the side of the foundation. Dragging her injured leg. With one arm holding the squirming bunnies. Awkwardly inches her way through the darkness back toward that locked entryway hatch. This time she easily finds it. Shoulders the cover up the few inches the padlock will allow. Using the rebar to prop it open. Haley gently pushes the ORPHANED BUNNIES through the gap. One of them turns. Trying to make its way back through. Looking for its mother. She tenderly nudges it out. A sad smile.
29) 39) dialog: No, honey. Stay there. You’1ll be safe. Haley carefully removes the rebar. Letting the hatch cover gently drop back into place. Exhales. A small victory.
29) 40) dialog: (mutters to herself) Now, how the hell are we getting out of here? From her position, she spots the REPTILE through the maze of supports. 55. It's lurking beneath the garage hatch. Lying in a few inches of muddy water. Haley can hear more water DRIPPING all around her.
29) 41) dialog: (calls into the darkness) Dad, this crawl space is flooding. What are we gonna do?
29) 43) dialog: Okay. I’m coming back. Keep an eye on that thing for me.
32) 0) text: Haley hears the distinct THUMP of a car door. Looks toward the front of the house. Unsure if she actually heard it. She changes directions. Quickly works her way through the cramped space. Swatting away cobwebs. Drops the rebar so she can crawl faster. Reaching a VENT set into the front of the foundation. She leans close. Peering out through the narrow slats.
32) 3) dialog: (yells)
33) 0) text: Bobby uses his flashlight to look into the pickup’s gloomy interior. Then turns toward Haley's Outback.
34) 0) text: Haley glances over her shoulder. Shouting to her dad.
34) 1) dialog: Dad, there’s someone outside! She shifts her attention back to the vent. Continues SCREAMING.
34) 2) dialog: Help! HELP! HITTING her fist against the metal cover. Trying to get Bobby's attention.
36) 0) text: Haley has her face up against the vent. Water's trickling in through the louvers.
36) 1) dialog: 
36) 5) dialog: DOWN HERE. HEY! HELP US! WE’RE
36) 7) text: It doesn’t seem to be working. Haley takes a different tact. Grabbing the flashlight. Shines it at the vent. Panning the beam over the slats. Clicking it on and off.
38) 0) text: Haley realizes that he’s leaving.
38) 1) dialog: HEY! WAIT! DON’T GO! Desperate to get his attention. Hope draining away. Then she sees her Outback. Haley reaches into her pocket. Pulls out her car keys. Fumbling for the button. Pointing the keychain toward the vent.
40) 0) text: Haley watches as Bobby crosses the lawn toward the front door.
40) 1) dialog: Come on... yes. Haley BLEEPS off the car alarm to hear better.
40) 2) dialog: Dad, he’s coming in! Muffled FOOTSTEPS. The CREAK of floorboards. A muted “hello?” Haley heads toward the sounds. Trying to get closer. POUNDING up on the floorboards.
40) 3) dialog: 
42) 0) text: Haley keeps moving. SLAMMING her fist into the floorboards overhead. Trying to get Bobby’s attention. Her knuckles getting scraped up and bloody. Haley screams. Voice growing hoarse and raspy. 60.
42) 1) dialog: HELP! WE’RE TRAPPED DOWN HERE!
42) 5) dialog: Doesn't hear him. She’s too busy HAMMERING the pipes. Trying to make as much NOISE as possible.
44) 0) text: Haley stops to listen as Bobby’s FOOTSTEPS move further into the house. 61.
44) 1) dialog: Dad, I think he’s looking for the hatch. Hears her dad’s frantic VOICE.
44) 3) dialog: Oh my God. She’s suddenly on alert. Switches on the flashlight. Eyes scanning the shadows. Trying to locate the reptile.
46) 0) text: Haley anxiously pans the flashlight back and forth. Checking all around her. Listening for any sign of the alligator.
46) 1) dialog: I can't see it!
47) 2) dialog: Sees Bobby in the lighted hatch. Needs to stop him.
47) 3) dialog: No! Frantically tries to signal him. Screaming. Waving her flashlight.
47) 4) dialog: 
48) 1) dialog: Watching in shock as the REPTILE flings him around.
48) 2) dialog: No. NOOO! Then a horrible sound. The CRACK of bones. His neck SNAPS. Bobby falls silent. 64. The alligator yanks the lifeless guard back into the darkness. Just the RUSTLE of movement. The water settles. Haley closes her eyes. A sense of total hopelessness. Can't get her breath. Suffocating. Now more afraid than ever. She opens her eyes. Realizes she needs to get back to her dad while that thing is distracted. Begins a desperate crawl. Clutching the rebar in one hand. The switched-off flashlight in the other. We're with her the whole way. Following Haley as she SPLASHES through the rising water. Trying to find her way back. In her panic, gets turned around. Realizes she’s lost. Clicks on the flashlight. Its beam scans the crawl space. Picks out that battered TRAP CAGE. Knows that she’s close.
48) 3) dialog: (harsh whisper) Dad? The beam falters. She shakes it. Breathing hard. It comes back on. Revealing a brief glimpse of the empty crawl space. It goes dark again. Haley, panicked, gives it another shake. A flash of the REPTILE snaking its way toward her. Then blackness. 65. Haley SCREAMS. Not knowing which way to go. CRIES OUT for her dad. Certain she’s about to die.
48) 4) dialog: 
48) 8) dialog: I’m fine. It's not as bad as it looks. Her dad winces as he shifts positions.
48) 9) dialog: How are you?
48) 11) dialog: That poor security guard. (beat) I tried to warn him.
48) 13) dialog: We’re never getting out of here, are we?
48) 16) dialog: Yeah. Her dad looks around at the rising water.
48) 18) dialog: We'll go together. Shakes his head. No. 67.
48) 22) dialog: I've been in tighter spaces than that today. Her dad smiles.
48) 26) dialog: I know. He hugs her tight.
48) 29) dialog: In tight quarters. Half swimming, half crawling on her stomach beneath the sunken living room. She pulls herself through the murky water. Trying to keep her head above the surface. But the water’s getting too high. Haley has to go under.
48) 31) dialog: Scrambles out on the other side of that low-hanging section. Into an unexplored portion of the crawl space. Sucks in a huge breath of air. She’s on her hands and knees now. Cautiously moving out and around. Hearing the reptile as it makes a beeline for that flashlight and her dad. 70. Haley feels her way forward in the dark. Splashing through the muck. Can’t yet see the open access hatch.
48) 34) dialog: Can now see the garage hatch up ahead through the gloom. Sloshes toward it. Moving through a pile of rotting vegetation. Twigs and leaves sticking up out of the water. The surface beneath her hand gives way with a CRUNCH. She lifts her hand to her face. It's covered in goo. And then she sees -- 71. A CRUSHED EGG. And more EGGS. Still intact. A dozen or so. It's a goddamn nest! This must be what that reptile was guarding. Then a low BELLOWING GROWL... As a SHAPE rises up from the shadows directly in front of her. Creeping forward.
48) 35) dialog: Oh... shit... She's face-to-face with a SECOND ALLIGATOR! Not as big as the first. But still scary as hell. This is a FEMALE. And it's very territorial. The animal HISSES. Haley slowly backs away. The female’s eyes burning into her. As it hovers over the remaining eggs. Protective. It HISSES again. SNAPPING at her. Haley spins around and starts crawling as fast as she can. Blindly SPLASHING through the darkness. Not sure where she's going.
48) 37) dialog: Weaves around supports. Under hanging insulation. Trying to put as much distance between her and that female reptile. She looks back. Appears to have shaken it. WHAM! The FEMALE ALLIGATOR suddenly charges in from the side. Its JAWS latching onto the thigh of her already injured leg. It’s a vicious collision. Like Haley’s been t-boned. The FEMALE pushes her through the darkness sideways. Haley's shoulder SLAMS into a support. She SCREAMS in pain. The female reptile flings her side to side. Jaws still clamped onto her upper leg. It’s close quarters. Brutal. Haley's punching back. Going for the eyes. Desperately trying to fight it off. Manages to kick free. Dazed. Blood flowing down her face. She grasps for something to hold on to as she tries to crawl away. Takes hold of a copper pipe overhead. Quickly let's go. It's scalding hot. Shit! Realizes she's beneath the HOT WATER HEATER. The female alligator lunges from the darkness. Bites down onto her ankle. Haley uses a loose piece of insulation to grab onto the hot copper pipe. 73. Pulling with both hands. Using the full weight of her body. Fighting through the pain. As the female reptile tries to drag her away. The copper’s bending at the joint. It SNAPS open! Haley twists out of the way aiming the full force of the scalding hot water at the FEMALE REPTILE. It SHRIEKS. Letting go of Haley. Retreating. Haley splashes to safety as the tank overhead empties. Adding forty gallons of hot water to the already flooded space. The haunting SHRIEKS of the burned creature continue from the shadows.
48) 41) dialog: Drenched. Banged up. Checks the damage to her already mangled leg. It’s really chewed up now. Punctured skin. Teeth marks. Blood seeping out. She vomits. Wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. Yelling back to her dad.
48) 42) dialog: Dad. There’s two of them! I didn’t make it. She’s trembling. Shaking from the loss of blood.
48) 43) dialog: (lies) But I’m okay. Sees that the open hatch is not that far away. She can make it.
48) 44) dialog: (quietly, to herself) Gotta move, Haley. Starts to crawl. A SPLASH. Somewhere off to her right. She puts her head down. Keeps going. She's reached that area where the clearance is higher. Now able to crawl faster. Almost there... The MALE REPTILE suddenly slides into view directly in front of her. Blocking her path. It GROWLS. Charging. Haley quickly shifts directions. Splashing back through the murky water. Her hand falls on something solid in the mud. Comes up -- Clutching her dad's large PIPE WRENCH. The one she passed over on her way in. That MALE REPTILE is powering toward her. Haley swings the heavy wrench. With everything she’s got. It makes contact. WHACK! Knocks the beast’s head sideways. SLAMMING its skull into a support.
48) 45) dialog: How do you like that, motherfucker!? The male reptile shakes it off. Haley splashes through the rising water. Takes shelter behind a large drain pipe. Nervously looks around. Knows the female is still lurking somewhere out there too. The MALE REPTILE charges from the shadows. Jaws open wide -- And CLAMPS onto the pipe. Tugging near a joint. Breaking the seal. More water spilling out. Flooding the space. As Haley retreats, her mom’s CHARM BRACELET snags on a support. And SNAPS. The male alligator moves around the broken pipe. Haley sees the bracelet fall into the rushing water. Grabs it. 75. 76. The creature SNAPS at her. Another glimpse of its massive jaws. Exposed teeth. Just missing Haley. She clambers back. Stuffing the bracelet into her pocket. Defiant.
48) 46) dialog: You're not getting that, Asshole! Haley swings the pipe wrench again. WHUMP! Stunning the animal. Buying herself some time. She scrambles away. Trying to orientate herself. She’s turned around. In a different portion of the crawl space. Spots a couple of METAL SUPPORT JACKS. Stabilizing some rotting posts. Propping up the sagging floor overhead. Realizes she’s under the kitchen. Haley kicks at one of the jacks. Hears the male reptile SCRAPING and SPLASHING in her direction. She HAMMERS at the jack with the pipe wrench. It shifts slightly in the mud. Hits it again. Lightning STRIKES really close. Instantly lighting the space. A brief glimpse of the advancing MALE REPTILE. Thunder BOOMS! Shaking the house on its foundation. Haley, more frantic now. Pounding at that jack with everything she’s got. It finally slips out from under the joist. The boards above her STRAINING. A loud CRACK. The weight of the rotting floor pushing down. The male alligator slices through the muddy water. Almost on her. 77. The water damaged posts SNAP like toothpicks. The joists overhead collapse. SPLASHING down. Along with a section of the subfloor. The entire KITCHEN ISLAND crashes down into the space. Haley tries to shield herself from all the falling debris. A HUGE SPLASH of mud and water. A beat as it settles. Leaving Haley trapped on one side of the cave-in. Not knowing if the male reptile is buried beneath it.
48) 49) dialog: Is COUGHING. Sees the pile of rubble and debris in front of her.
48) 50) dialog: (yelling back) I’m good. (then) Just a slight change of plans. She tries to move. Her damaged leg is pinned under a fallen beam. The male reptile GROWLS on the other side. Trying to dig out from under the rubble. Haley attempts to free herself. Using the pipe wrench. Shoving it into the mud next to her trapped leg. 78. Trying to pry up the fallen beam. It won't budge. Too heavy. She starts digging instead. Clawing at the mud around her leg. Pressing against the beam with her good leg. Slowly starts pulling herself out from under. Takes a deep breath. A final push. SCREAMS as she yanks her mangled leg free. Backs away from the fallen debris. Splashing through the dark water. She's tired. Drained. Can’t quit now. Needs to find another way out. Haley detects a foul stench. Covers her mouth. She’s stumbled into a stash of DEAD ANIMALS. Rotting carcasses. Chewed up. Haley gags. Backing in the other direction. Touches a HAND and ARM -- The remains of that SECURITY GUARD. His MANGLED CORPSE jammed into the tight space. Dead eyes staring up. Haley stifles a scream. Collecting herself.
48) 51) dialog: (her voice shaking) Dad, I found the security guard! A beat. Her dad processing this. Then --
48) 53) dialog: (calls into the darkness) Dad, hang on!
48) 55) dialog: SPLASHES back along the rear edge of the foundation. Half swimming, half crawling. Reaching that vent. Rainwater pours in through the slats. She aims the gun toward the vent. FIRES into the metal cover. Near the edges. Where the bolts hold it in place. Each GUNSHOT is deafening. Haley twists her body around. Kicks madly at the loosened vent cover with her good leg. Knocking it out completely. With the cover off, more rainwater surges in. Haley takes one final look behind her and squeezes through.
49) 0) text: Haley gets an arm out the open vent. Then her shoulder. She claws at the mud. It's tight. Haley's stuck. Squirming wildly. Half in, half out. Knows her lower half is completely exposed. She inches herself forward. Finally pulls free. Tank top plastered in mud. Winces in pain as she gets to her feet. Sees the swimming pool. The rear sliding glass door. 81. Turns back, yelling into the open vent.
49) 1) dialog: Dad, I’m out! The JAWS OF THE FEMALE REPTILE SMASH OUT through the Opening! SNAPPING at her.
49) 2) text: Haley staggers back. She limps toward the sliding glass door. Favoring her good leg. Moving around the edge of the pool. The FEMALE REPTILE continues squeezing its way through the narrow vent. The wind is intense. Rain SLAMMING down on Haley. A METAL LOUNGE CHAIR blows across the deck. Splashing down into the pool. Haley's damaged leg buckles as she loses her footing on the slick surface. And tumbles over the side. Into the deep end. SPLASHING down into eight feet of murky water. She goes UNDER. The gun slipping from her grip. Sinking to the bottom. Haley bursts to the SURFACE. Coughing. Swims toward the edge. Tries to pull herself up out of the water. Her arms too weak and tired. A FLASH of lightning reveals -- The female reptile. Now completely free of the vent. Crawling rapidly toward the pool. SPLASHING down into the shallow end. It swims toward Haley. Sinking beneath the surface. Haley tries to reach the ladder. Her wet hands keep slipping. Can't get a grip. 82. The RAIN is pounding down. Haley spins around. Scanning the pool. Where the hell did that thing go?
51) 0) text: Haley's got her own problems. The FEMALE REPTILE surfaces. Just a few yards away. Slicing through the water toward her. Jaws SNAPPING. Haley grabs the floating lounge chair. Pushes it between her and the female alligator. Then dives under.
51) 1) text: Murky. Her hair swirling. Frantically searching the bottom of the pool for that gun. Lightning FLASHES. Its glow penetrates the water. A glimpse of the female’s DARK OUTLINE gliding past just overhead. Plunging down toward Haley. Haley kicks wildly. Trying to swim out of its path. 83. The animal's HUGE TAIL sweeps past. KNOCKING into her.
51) 3) text: A silent scream as Haley is dragged to the bottom. Trailing a cloud of bubbles. The animal holds her under. Trying to drown her. Haley desperately fights to get free. Lungs about to burst. Her left arm flailing. Hand searching -- Finds the gun! Sweeping it up. Pressing the barrel against the female reptile’s head. Pulls the trigger. Point blank. The gun kicks. A MUFFLED BANG. Air bubbles surging from the barrel. As a bullet rips into the animal’s leathery skin. Blood clouding the water. 84. The female reptile goes slack. Releasing its grip. Haley pushes the dead animal off her. And kicks for the surface.
52) 0) text: Haley crawls up over the lip of the pool. Pulling herself out. Drenched clothes clinging to her body. She looks like she's been through hell. And she's still not finished. Haley limps toward the sliding glass door. Hair soaked and matted. Arm bleeding. Yanks at the handle. It's locked. Fuck! She searches the deck. Grabs an overturned metal chair. SMASHING it into the tempered glass. It DENTS. But doesn't break. Haley swings the chair again. This time the glass SHATTERS.
53) 0) text: Haley staggers in. The last bit of gray daylight outside filters in. She finds the CROWBAR lying in the corner of the dining room. Next to the sledgehammer and other tools. Snatches it up.
53) 1) dialog: (calling out) Dad? Where are you? Listens... Hears a faint TAPPING coming from below. 85. A relieved smile. She follows it. Haley jams the crowbar between some boards. Prying them up.
53) 2) dialog: Dad, I'm coming! Ripping up more of the subfloor next to the sunken living room. Zeroing in on the sound.
53) 3) dialog: Hang on! Haley continues ripping a hole in the floor. Exposing more of the framework beneath. A glimpse of her dad. His face pressed up between the joists. She pries up a few more boards. Reaches down to help him out. Her dad uses the rebar to push himself up. Trying to get his one good leg beneath him. Haley jump down into the flooded crawl space to get more leverage. Helps lift him out. Her dad rolls onto his back. Exhausted. Coughing up water. Relief. Haley exhales. Still knee-deep in the flooded crawl space. A moment of calm. They’re safe. Finally. Then the loosened floorboards nearby SHIFT. Haley spins around as -- The MALE REPTILE crashes up over the exposed pipes. Tearing its way through the broken subfloor. Scraped up. Looking pissed. 86. Lets out a loud BELLOWING ROAR. Haley tries to climb from the murky water. But her tourniquet SNAGS on one of the supports. The creature lunges toward her. About to strike -- Her dad staggers up, still clutching that piece of rebar. And HURLS himself toward the beast. Stabbing the steel rod down into the male reptile’s head. Like a harpoon. His weight and momentum pushing the rebar through the animal's leathery skin. A wet THUNK. The reptile lets out a bone-chilling SCREAM. The tip of the rebar gets stuck in the rotting floorboards beneath the animal. It THRASHES wildly for a moment. Twisting and turning. Lashing with its tail. Pinned to the floor. Finally gives up the fight. Goes still. Haley frees her leg and climbs out. Just inches from the dead animal’s jaws. She collapses down next to her dad. He hugs her close.
54) 0) text: A beautiful sunny day. Time has passed. Haley's recovered some but is still on crutches. She’s tending to the something in front of her. Can’t see what. Her dad limps toward her. Leg in a cast. His arm ina sling. Right now they're the walking wounded. But soon the scars will heal.
54) 2) dialog: This would've been one hell of a story to tell Mom. He puts his good arm around his daughter.
54) 4) dialog: You know what the last thing she said to me was? A silent beat.
54) 5) dialog: Take care of your father. A sad smile. He squeezes her shoulder.
54) 7) dialog: Did I ever tell you that I like your earring.
