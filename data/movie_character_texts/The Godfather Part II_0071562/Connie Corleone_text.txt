25) 23) dialog: We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
25) 27) dialog: Michael...
25) 29) dialog: You're not my father!
25) 31) dialog: Because I need MONEY!
25) 33) text: Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
25) 34) dialog: It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen? She turns angrily, leaving Michael standing face to face with Merle.

41) 0) text: Some quiet, informally dressed couples wait in the rear o the chapel; some talking, others sitting nervously. A single organ plays some standard wedding music. The VIEW PANS up to the altar, where Connie and Merle, in the same clothing they wore to the Tahoe party, are being married by a Justice of the Peace. The Justice goes through the bored, simple ceremony, and begin to HEAR an echo of the waltz Connie danced with her father, when she was married all those years ago in Long Island.
105) 4) text: Well...come in. This entourage enters the suite, an impressive and beautifully spacious luxury suite.  Connie is relaxing.
105) 5) dialog: What is it?
105) 7) dialog: Can't be...
105) 10) dialog: I'll take care of it in Naples.
105) 12) dialog: That son of a bitch!
106) 0) text: Connie and Merle are attempting to sleep in the miniature cabin in bunk beds.  The little space is crowded with the trunks and luggage.  Merle can barely hang onto the bunk, the boat pitches so violently below.

Connie steps back, and moves through the small group of friends and relatives, into Michael's house.

220) 4) dialog: Is Kay coming?
220) 6) dialog: Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
220) 8) dialog: Kids, why don't you go outside for a while? The children don't move; Connie realizes they will only listen to Michael.
220) 9) dialog: I want to talk to you, Michael.
220) 11) dialog: I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.  I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too.  But I understand you now; I think I do.  You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was.  And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.  Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you. Slowly, Michael puts his hand on her hair, and touches he gently.
220) 12) dialog: You need me, Michael.  I want to be with you now.
230) 3) dialog: Anthony.
230) 6) dialog: He can't go; Michael wants to take him into Reno.

236) 8) dialog: Don't worry; I'm sure he got here on time.  The roads from the airport are so windy, it takes forever; I've driven them myself. She picks up some of the serving plates that he has left untouched.
236) 9) dialog: I'll bring him out to you as soon as he comes. She moves back to the main house.
237) 10) dialog: Don't let me interrupt anything, this will just take a second.  Here. (she takes out a small needle, and begins to prepare it)
237) 13) dialog: Whenever I see that lake so cold, I think of poor Fredo, drowned.  Lake Tahoe is very cold.  They say if a person drowns in it, that the body will remain mid-suspended -- perfectly preserved.  Some say it will remain forever. She finishes the shot, puts her things away.
237) 14) dialog: Your boy will be right back. She leaves.
