99) 1) dialog: There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
99) 4) dialog: No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother. Hagen in very moved.
99) 6) dialog: No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.

99) 14) dialog: I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
99) 16) dialog: If I'm wrong... There is a KNOCK on the door.

100) 2) dialog: Fish them out. Several of the men wade down into the stream; Rocco helps and even Tom steps down to get a better look at who they were.  They are total strangers; Rocco examines the type guns they used. When they climb back onto the ground, Michael is gone. Everyone notices it, but no one says anything.

108) 4) dialog: Put it right there. The porter does so; as he places the tray down, he catche glimpse of a second person in the compartment with Michae

111) 10) dialog: You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
111) 13) dialog: The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
111) 16) dialog: Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon. (leaning toward the old man, sincerely)

118) 14) dialog: Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
118) 16) dialog: I know.
118) 18) dialog: (coldly, but convincing)
118) 21) dialog: This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.

132) 23) dialog: I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him. The various men look up as Michael eats his cake, wonderi what the point of it is.

157) 13) dialog: The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
157) 15) dialog: It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.

I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
