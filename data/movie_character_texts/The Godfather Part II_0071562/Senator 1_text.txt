A moment goes by, and then Tom Hagen enters, closing the door behind him. We begin to HEAR Senator Geary's amplified voice resoundi over the lake.  Hagen moves to Sandra.  She takes him in arms, comforting, holding his head against her full breas
31) 1) dialog: ...my thanks, and the thanks of the young people of the State of Nevada, for this most impressive endowment... (he holds a check in his hand)
31) 2) text: ...made to the University in the name of Anthony Vito Corleone. Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone. Applause.  Senator Geary returns the microphone to the Maestro who adds:
31) 5) dialog: Where can we meet alone? Michael indicates the boathouse a distance away, where Ne seems to be waiting for them.  Then Michael leans to Rocc
32) 0) text: Michael, the Senator, Neri and Rocco make a group in the dark, large room.
32) 3) dialog: I thought we would meet alone.
32) 5) dialog: (taking out some medication)
32) 6) text: Some water. He addresses that to Neri, who resentfully goes to fetch Senator a glass of water.
32) 7) dialog: Alright, Corleone.  I'm going to be very frank with you.  Maybe more frank than any man in my position has ever spoken to you before. Michael nods, indicating that he should do so.
32) 8) dialog: The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources... (takes the water from Neri and swallows his pills)
32) 11) dialog: Let's forget the bullshit, I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to.  You can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash, plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross... Michael is taken aback; he looks at Hagen.
32) 12) dialog: ...of all three Corleone hotels. Hagen is frustrated; all his information was wrong.
32) 14) dialog: I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
32) 18) text: We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
32) 19) dialog: All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
32) 21) dialog: I'll expect your answer, with payment, by tomorrow morning.  Only don't contact me...from now on, deal only through Turnbull. He is almost out the door.
101) 0) text: The Senate is in session; Senator Geary is on the floor during a vote.  An aide approaches him, with a slip of pa
102) 0) text: The Senator steps behind his desk.
102) 1) dialog: All right, Mr. Hagen, you've got ten minutes. He flicks the switch of a small tape recorder.
102) 2) dialog: ...and the tape will be running.
102) 4) dialog: What the hell are you talking about?
102) 6) dialog: No strings.
102) 8) dialog: No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
102) 10) dialog: A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
102) 12) dialog: Maybe two, three thousand dollars. Hagen leans forward, and deposits a handful of paper on t Senator's desk.
102) 14) dialog: There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
102) 17) dialog: You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
102) 19) dialog: And what's the price of their not finding out.
102) 21) dialog: (he despises Hagen)
149) 3) dialog: Good to see you, Mike; I'm glad we can spend this time together.
149) 6) dialog: I'll take a Yolanda. Laughter.
149) 8) dialog: To a night in Havana! They all join in.
150) 0) text: By now the group has made its way into the casino.  Some them are crowded around the crap table; Senator Geary is with the enormous and beautiful Yolanda, who barely speak English.  There are other girls with some of the men; not with Michael, who gambles dollars while talking to Corngo
152) 1) dialog: (pushing away from the palm outstretched little hands of the boys)
152) 5) dialog: He lost a quarter million dollars at the casino.
152) 6) dialog: ...goddamn city of whores...
152) 7) dialog: He gave them a bad check.
153) 8) dialog: Ohmygod.  I don't believe it.
166) 0) text: An orchestra plays for the guests, as an army of waiters serve champagne and hors d'oeuvres.  Michael relaxes with Senator Geary, Major Leon, and several of the Americans.
166) 2) dialog: We believe in non-intervention... but the agreement stipulates that our forces may be withdrawn... but as you've seen, we have not withdrawn them.
189) 1) dialog: Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the "Genco Olive Oil Company."
189) 3) dialog: But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
189) 5) dialog: What position did you occupy?
189) 8) dialog: What is that exactly?
189) 10) dialog: No, I don't know, explain that exactly.
189) 16) dialog: Did you ever get such an order directly from Michael Corleone?
189) 18) dialog: (very autocratic, deep South, gentlemanly man)
206) 1) dialog: Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
206) 3) dialog: Did he use at times an alias?  Was this alias in certain circles
206) 6) dialog: (Senator from New York, very smooth, partly liberal, Tammany Hall)
206) 7) text: Let me agree with that.  Many of my constituents are Italian and have been honored with that certain friendship by my close Italian friends.  Up to this point before I have to leave this hearing to join my own committee, let me say, that this hearing on the Mafia is in no way a slur on the Italians by the Senate; nor is it meant to be; nor will I allow it to be.  Italian Americans are the hardest working, most law abiding patriotic Americans of our country.  It is a shame and a pity that a few rotten apples give them a bad name.  We are here to weed those rotten apples out of the vast healthy barrel of Italian Americans, who are one of the backbones of our country. There is a pause for a while, while the New York Senator poses for the TV cameras and leaves the hearing so that h will not be associated with hearing the rough stuff.
206) 8) dialog: I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
206) 10) dialog: This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
206) 12) dialog: Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
206) 14) dialog: Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
206) 16) dialog: Why is it necessary for your counsel to advise you on that question?
206) 18) dialog: Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
206) 20) dialog: Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
206) 23) dialog: I don't think that's necessary.
206) 25) dialog: Very well. At this point Senator Rogers contemptuously walks out of hearing room.
206) 28) dialog: We are all impressed.  The committee will now recess over the weekend. However, it will continue Monday morning, at eleven a.m.  At that time, this committee will then produce a witness directly linking Mr. Corleone to the charges we have made.  And then, Mr. Corleone may very well by liable for indictments of perjury.  However, this document will be made a matter of record.
215) 11) dialog: We have here a witness who will testify further on Michael Corleone's rule of the criminal empire that controls gambling in this country and perhaps in other countries.  This witness had no buffer between himself and Michael Corleone.  He can corroborate our charges on enough counts for this committee to consider a charge of perjury against Michael Corleone. (then he turns to Pentangeli)
215) 14) dialog: Were you a member of the Corleone Family?  Were you under the Caporegime Peter Clemenza, under Vito Corleone, known as the Godfather? There is a long silence.
215) 19) dialog: Mr. Pentangeli, you are contradicting your confessions to our investigators; I ask you again, were you a member of a crime organization headed by Michael Corleone?
215) 21) dialog: We have your confession that you murdered on the orders of Michael Corleone.  Do you deny that confession and do you know what denying that confession will mean to you? The die is cast and like a good soldier, Pentangeli will all the way now.  So he is brazen in his defiance of the Senator.
215) 24) dialog: Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
215) 27) dialog: Is he related to the witness?
215) 30) dialog: (to Vincenzo Pentangeli)
215) 33) dialog: (furious)
215) 36) dialog: This meeting is adjourned.
215) 39) dialog: The committee is adjourned until further notice. For the first time, in the midst of the confusion, Hagen smiles.  A bitter, contemptuous smile.
