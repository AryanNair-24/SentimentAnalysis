1) 0) text: Heat that has mass. That rises off the parched earth in shimmering waves. After a moment, we see what appear to be figures coming out of the haze, one by one. A family with their few belongings: HASARI PAL, 33, his wife, ALOKA, 28, and their children, daughter, AMRITA, 13, sons MANOOJ and SHAMBU, 11 and 9; HASARI'S MOTHER and FATHER. They embark toward the night, the rising sun behind them.
3) 1) dialog: (to his neighbor)
10) 2) dialog: Daddy, I'm scared.
11) 3) text: The Pals, scared, dispirited, weary, consumed by the crowd. They've been walking a long  time. Shambu cries; Aloka tries to ease his fear. They  stop numbly at the edge of the park, put their bundles down against a long wall. Across the way, a thin policeman shares a cigarette with a group of traders. There is a deeply fearful look in Hasari's eyes, a look he is having difficulty controlling now. He needs to revive the family's confidence. He takes out his precious bundle of rupees and gives one to Manooj. Manooj, though, is fixed on the cinema across the street. Hasari indicates a stall just across the main road.
12) 0) text: A brick slides out of the wall. We're BEHIND the brick and see Gangooly's soft face as he reaches in and pulls out a key. The street is small and empty.  Though the houses are nothing much, to the Pals, they look like palaces. Manooj and Shambu run about in delight. Gangooly motions for quiet. With a flourish, he  opens the door.
17) 0) text: Shambu is paddling near the tap. Aloka is bending over the drain and Amrita is rinsing her heavy, dark hair with a pot. Manooj is nearby, rubbing himself with an old towel. Hasari enters unnoticed and looks at the group with tenderness... and with gratitude for their good fortune. A MAN, red with anger, yanks the curtain aside, stares. The family freezes. Aloka's hair drips unnoticed on her sari.
22) 1) dialog: With his eyes open, watching the dead man being removed.
24) 0) text: Aloka huddled with Manooj and Amrita. Hasari talking to the owner of a small market stall. Shambu is peering into a shop with male mannequins in the window.
32) 13) dialog: The police came!
52) 0) text: We hear the BELL TINKLING as the rickshaw, pulled by Hasari, carrying Ram and Aloka (holding Shambu) arrives (Amrita and Manooj trotting beside their father). Surya, Selima, other neighbors greet them as they come. The Pals glance into the school at Joan, who's teaching an evening class.
55) 1) text: The cause of the excitement is Hasari running TOWARD us, feet flying, as he pulls the rickshaw, loaded with a huge sack. Manooj and Shambu are clinging to the sides of the machine. Ram stands   in the center of the square. He shouts a command and   Hasari struggles to bring the rickshaw to a stop. It's    not easy and Sunil -- who's arriving -- has jump out of   the way to the accompaniment of apologies f Hasari and   Ram and hoots of laughter from the children. Outside the clinic, a line of perhaps seventy-five wait patiently, watching as Hasari takes off again. The wheels of the rickshaw hit a rut. Hasari loses control, the sack tips back and Hasari is lifted into the air, feet kicking as he tries to regain his balance. Aloka and Amrita, sitting near the bawling Ram, can't hold back their laughter.
62) 23) dialog: Are you the American doctor?    Are you coming here to help us.
62) 25) dialog: Do you go to the cinema in America, El Max?
70) 6) text: Max approaches. A buzz    about Max's heroics; hands comi together. Max raises a    hand in benediction, makes the sign of the cross. Max    claps Hasari on the shoulder; Hasari brings his hands   together and gives Max a genuinely pleased smile.    Children circle and touch him Manooj and Shambu among   them.
81) 0) text: Everyone lingers, adults and children. Max plays his trumpet, accompanying Surya on his zither. Manooj hovers over Max.
81) 1) dialog: Doctor Big Brother, aren't you going to smoke your evening cigar? Max points at his trumpet, continues playing.
81) 2) dialog: Please. Max indicates his pocket. Manooj takes out a cigar and a clip. Clips the cigar, holds it out to Max, who indi- cates Manooj should light it, and keeps playing. Manooj looks at Hasari, who nods. Shambu holds a match to it. Everyone watches as if this were a major event. Manooj takes a puff, chokes, offers the cigar to Mehboub, who takes it, puffs, passes it. Everyone relaxes, enjoys the peacefulness of the smoking and the aroma wafting upward. Ram taps at Max's elbow.
81) 16) dialog: Why do you have to go home, Doctor Babu?
83) 0) text: Margareta, Manooj, Shambu, Shoba, several other kids and, at the end of the line, Poomina, all carrying water on their heads toward the City of Joy. Suddenly, someone whispers to Poomina. One of Ashoka's thugs. She glances after Margareta and the other kids who are turning a corner and steps into:
106) 0) text: Max comes into the square. Aloka and Selima are pre- paring meals. Manooj, Shambu, and three other boys playing. Ram is trying to jolly Hasari, who's deep in his own reverie. Max stands in front of Hasari.
112) 0) text: The street children's school now takes up two rooms. Children peer out of one room now as, to the accompani- ment of Surya's zither, twenty or so girls are doing some Indian classical dancing, under the eye of a young Indian teacher. Across the way, in the other room, some children are translating Bengali words into English. A boy is writing on the board. It's Manooj. We see that Shambu is in the same class.
115) 0) text: Startled, frightened, Hasari presses himself against the wall, as does Manooj. Hasari is wearing a wet dhoti, caught in the middle of straightening the wheel rim of the old rickshaw.
117) 1) dialog: I can't decide if I want to be Kumar Kapur or a doctor.
117) 3) dialog: You're so much fun, El Max. I wish my daddy were as much fun as you. Max stops the fight, takes Manooj by the shoulders.
118) 0) text: Manooj runs   ahead of everyone as he charges into Ram's hut, crying   for his father. Behind Manooj come the others, Max   carrying Shambu in his arms. Hasari and Aloka, Ram,   Joan, others in the square hurtle out of their huts.
124) 15) dialog: I know!   Dry.
129) 0) text: Amrita, Manooj, and Shambu. With them, Subash flirting with Amrita, incurring the wrath and admiration of her brothers, causing her to flush. THUNDER sounds. They all look up. Rain starts to fall. People run outside of workshops and huts, crying, "The rains, the rains." Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shakes the earth and rain begins to bombard them. The rain falls, the WIND HOWLS, and people in the lane are dancing, praising the beginning of the monsoon season. Men tear off their shirts, women rush out fully clothed, singing. Swarms of naked children run about. The kids run toward the clinic/school.
131) 6) dialog: Yes, she does. His name is Subash Ghosh. His father owns the workshop.
155) 1) text: Manooj, seated between Hasari and Max.
