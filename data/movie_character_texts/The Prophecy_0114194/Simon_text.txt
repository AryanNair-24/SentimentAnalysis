0) 8) text: The gargoyle drops his head and DRIVES himself into Simon who HAMMERS the gargoyle with his fists. Blood SMEARS. The gargoyle's gotten free a knife that he JAMS into Simo leg. Pressing home his advantage, the gargoyle SLAMS Simo up against the wall. He TEARS open Simon's shirt, digging his fingers into the chest, RIPPING the skin aside, the f plunging deep, CRACKING the sternum bone, pushing even  further, toward the blood gouged pumping beneath -- -- Simon PLOWS his knee up between the gargoyle's legs. O and over. Till the grip loosens and Simon SHOVES him to o side, using the momentum and drives to SWING the body aro and at the shattered window. The gargoyle SMACKS the fram and COLLAPSES, his head CRACKING on the sill and FORCING shard of glass through his neck. Simon moves to the window and brushes aside the gargoyle' sunglasses, revealing two totally empty eye sockets. Push his thumbs into them, Simon uses the leverage to lift the gargoyle off the sill and push his body out the window. The gargoyle bounces once on the fire escape, then spread eagles thirty feet to the asphalt. Somebody turns up their Mexican radio station. The gargoyle's a wreck. But he manages, slowly -- his shattered remains arguing e inch -- to climb first to his knees, then miserably to hi feet. A bent, splattered, hopeless thing that manages to  stumble three or four feet before being HIT by a freeway- speed firebird BOMBING down the alley. The impact PINS the gargoyle to the grill and RAMS him in a brick wall, CRUSHING a chest that BELCHES out a sickly, bruised heart like a wet rag against the firebird's  windshield.

As it becomes too much he  leans his weight against the rock wall and shuts his eyes It's then they come. Flashes of images: Of screams and fi Of impossible vistas of emptiness and death. And shriekin overhead, shrieking everywhere; grotesque, winged creatur with no eyes. Some with faces we know; Gabriel, Simon, an the gargoyle. All these images are being jammed into both their minds by the cave. Thomas forces his eyes open but the scenes playing all ar him won't go away. Tears are running down Katherine's fac as she stands there locked in the same images. Thomas stu about the room as if drunk, the visions, incomprehendibly black visions of war and destruction on an alien plateau, eat his brain. He sinks to his knees and begins to cry.
