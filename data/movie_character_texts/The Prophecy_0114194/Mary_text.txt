Thomas, one eye still half-shut by a bandage, walks over the village's edge where a short stone wall, and little e separates the adobe homes from the long, 2000 foot drop t the desert floor. He leans against it and gazes out on a  view that must encompass half the world. In all direction for tens upon tens of miles, there are only volcanic spir and crumbling buttes, all reduced from up here to short,  ominous playthings. A village truly alone in the world.

Through the ch smoke can be seen Mary lying on a mat as Grey Horse chant to the yei spirits and adds fine colored earth to the gro sand painting beside her. His voice rises and falls in  guttural syntax. He's coaxing. Coaxing the alien spirit o of the child.
74) 57) text: And he's on her. With his left arm he brutally forces her her knees as his right hand, palm out and fingers splayed clamp themselves over her face. Katherine's mouth opens i silent scream as the pain, immediate and beyond endurance flows through her body. From somewhere outside, there's a sound. Katherine gulps chokes of agony as her very clothes begin smolder around her. We hear the sound once more, closer, before -- The entire kiva wall EXPLODES INWARD as Katherine's picku CRASHES through it. The mangled grill and hood SLAM into  Gabriel from the side and SMASH him to the ground like a  broken puppet. Katherine falls backward to the floor, get up, and runs to the truck's cab. Inside sits a near catat Thomas. Katherine takes only a second to share a look wit him before reaching back and pulling out the pickup's tir iron. Gabriel, a shattered, broken thing, pulls himself up to h knees. The sunglasses are gone and two eyeless pits stare out at Mary, huddled in the corner. Bleeding from every p one arm bent back the wrong way, he crawls across the flo toward her, his voice the milky slur of a stroke victim.
74) 86) text: Lucifer slams Gabriel's head against the floor and pins i As the angel thrashes furiously, Lucifer FORCES his arm i Gabriel's chest. Gabriel cries out as Lucifer PULLS his a half out and FORCES it deeper. Again. And again. Soon  Gabriel's screams become giggles, then a crazed, hysteric laughter. The room goes insane. An impossible nightmare of chanting Navahos, glaring headlights, and Gabriel's echoing laught as Lucifer pumps his chest. Laughter that rises to a kind orgasmic cry then instantly stops as Lucifer pulls out th angel's heart, And eats it. At that instant Grey Horse places his hand on Mary's fore speaks a last line, and the chant is completed. Sticky, smoky, awful silence. Gabriel is a non-thing. A  battered, hollow shell. Bartholomew Grey Horse, his voice cracked and finished, t to Katherine.
