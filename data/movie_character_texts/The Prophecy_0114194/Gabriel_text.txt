Katherine gulps chokes of agony as her very clothes begin smolder around her. We hear the sound once more, closer, before -- The entire kiva wall EXPLODES INWARD as Katherine's picku CRASHES through it. The mangled grill and hood SLAM into  Gabriel from the side and SMASH him to the ground like a  broken puppet. Katherine falls backward to the floor, get up, and runs to the truck's cab. Inside sits a near catat Thomas. Katherine takes only a second to share a look wit him before reaching back and pulling out the pickup's tir iron. Gabriel, a shattered, broken thing, pulls himself up to h knees. The sunglasses are gone and two eyeless pits stare out at Mary, huddled in the corner. Bleeding from every p one arm bent back the wrong way, he crawls across the flo toward her, his voice the milky slur of a stroke victim.
