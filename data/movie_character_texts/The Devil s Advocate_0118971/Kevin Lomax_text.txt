2) 1) dialog: Lloyd, as your attorney, I'm advising you to get the fuck away from me.
2) 3) dialog: The wife. The kid. The outrage. You definitely had me fooled.
2) 5) dialog: You know what I'm thinking? Why don't we put you on the stand and you can jerk off for the judge.
2) 7) dialog: Get the hell out of my way. Gettys standing aside, as we --

5) 19) dialog: You ever pass notes in class, Barbara? Maybe a note that made fun of Mr. Gettys?
5) 21) dialog: No? Never called him a 'disgusting pig monster'?
5) 23) dialog: Your Honor, I've pre-marked this Defense Exhibit A...
5) 26) dialog: (right to the note)
5) 31) dialog: You wrote this in his class.
5) 33) dialog: 'He's a huge hog beast. He probably eats a thousand pancakes for breakfast.' You're writing here about Mr. Gettys, aren't you?
5) 35) dialog: Have you ever had a party at your house when your parents were away? (waiting)
5) 38) dialog: Credibility and bias.
5) 42) dialog: The word special came up in your testimony earlier. You claimed that Mr. Gettys asked you whether you had special feelings, if you felt special. (beat)
5) 48) dialog: Is this game sexual in nature? (waiting)
5) 51) dialog: This special party, Barbara, this was the first time you told the story about Mr. Gettys.
5) 53) dialog: I've spoken to the other children who were there that day. Can you think of anything else, Barbara, they might have told me about that party?
5) 55) dialog: (right at Barbara)
5) 58) dialog: You threatened those children, didn't you?
5) 60) dialog: You told them to falsely claim that Mr. Gettys had hurt them, didn't you?
5) 64) dialog: Because if they didn't go along you were going to tell everyone about this special party.
5) 66) dialog: So you made up a story. A special story, about a math teacher -- a disgusting pig monster -- you didn't like. That's what really happened, isn't it?
5) 69) dialog: I have no further questions, Your Honor. Chaos -- court officers struggling with Barbara's Father and people yelling and Gettys hugging his wife and son and the gavel banging like mad and Kevin just sitting there, staring at the floor, completely drained, emotionally, morally, physically and -- In the back of the room, a man.

16) 10) dialog: She's my first pass.
16) 12) dialog: You see his shoes?
16) 17) dialog: He polishes those shoes every night. He makes his own clothes. He may look like a brother-with- an-attitude to you, but I see a man who's got a shotgun under his bed and woe betide the creature who steps into his garden. (beat) And number six? Your favorite? She's damaged goods.
16) 19) dialog: No. There's something missing from her. She's wrong. (eyes to the pool) She wants on this jury. Somebody hurt her and she wants revenge.

Eight days ago, in Kansas City, two men pushed a calf into a steel frame as a third man fired a high- voltage staple-gun into the animal's skull. Men kill animals and eat their flesh. Phillipe Moyez killed a goat. He killed a goat. And he did it at home, in a manner consistent with his religious beliefs. Now some people may find it bizarre.
50) 5) dialog: It's certainly not a religious practice performed by everyone. It's not as common as, say, circumcision. It's certainly not as common as the belief that wine is transformed into blood. It's not even as common as the handling of poisonous snakes to prove one's faith. But Phillipe Moyez isn't two thousand miles away in a stockyard. He doesn't use electricity to kill. And worst of all... (holding up the roast) Phillipe Moyez is not shrink- wrapped.
50) 7) dialog: Your Honor, the city timed this police action to catch my client exercising his constitutionally- protected right to religious freedom.
50) 10) dialog: Exactly, Your Honor. And I'd like to move at this time for an immediate directed verdict for dismissal.
50) 15) dialog: I'm aware of that, Your Honor, which is why I feel confident in requesting a dismissal.

Carved into the marble are human forms -- young, naked bodies swimming in a hypnotic chaos of clouds. Milton is on the phone. Two lines going. The dialogue is unimportant, we'll not understand it anyway -- he's going back and forth between Korean and Russian -- brokering some emergency deal. Heath is at the bar, mixing drinks. Barzoon has a cigar. Kevin just standing there gaping at the space.

They know you and your wife were living separately. They see this maid -- Elucinda -- a sixty-eight-year-old grandmother supporting seven children. And then there's your stepson, a ten-year-old with a bullet in his brain. Those are already powerful images in the mind of the public.
73) 9) dialog: I'm telling you how it looks. You discover the crime. You call it in. You've got blood on your person and clothes, and -- (before Cullen can cut him off) -- and -- your prints are on the murder weapon.

89) 20) dialog: Give it over.    Now. Gimme the gun.
89) 22) dialog: That's my job. When the case is over you can have it back. (strong) This is a dealbreaker, Alex.
89) 24) dialog: Okay.   Let's wrap it up.
89) 26) dialog: We need to talk to your assistant.

Inside, a woman, one of the dancers, all but nude, stepping into her dress. A simply perfect body. And then she turns TOWARD us and it's Christabella -- clearly -- for a single moment -- before she slams shut the door. Kevin crosses to the door.   Knocks.   And again. The door opens.   A DANCER standing there.    It's not Christabella.

110) 4) dialog: Wrong answer. (listen to me) Your prenuptial agreement is on file at the firm. The contract is null and void in the event of marital infidelity. (beat) You fuck around, she gets rich. (you asshole) That's a motive, Alex. (long pause) What do I need to know?

123) 4) dialog: If it's a choice, I'll go now. I won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.
123) 6) dialog: We just spent our morning listening to Mr. Broygo talk about his 'evidence'. What he neglected to tell you is what this case is really about. He left out the most important fact of all: Alex Cullen was somewhere else when these murders took place. Now, Alex Cullen has done a lot of things I don't like. He's been a terrible husband to all three of his wives. He's been a destructive force in the lives of his step-children. He's cheated the city. His partners. His employees. He's paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and fines over the years. I don't like those things. I don't expect you to like them. There will be other things during the course of this trial that you will hear about and like even less. But this isn't a popularity contest. It's a murder trial and Alex Cullen hasn't killed anybody.
123) 10) dialog: The state is going all out here. They've got a whole team over there. They're throwing everything but the kitchen sink at this case. I need one thing from you. That's it. One thing. I need you to ask yourself, 'Is not liking this man reason enough to convict him of murder?' (beat) Enjoy your lunch. We'll talk again.

124) 2) text: Kevin -- one push -- Cullen sent flying.
124) 3) dialog: Listen to me like you've never listened to anybody before. I'm going to bust my ass to make sure they hate you. Because as long as you're out boning Melissa, you're not home killing your wife.
124) 5) dialog: Then it doesn't look spontaneous.
125) 1) dialog: Let me put it this way, then: can you tell from a blood sample if the person were alive or dead?
125) 3) dialog: And there's a two hour window in which to place these murders.
125) 5) dialog: So, you've got absolutely no way to determine the condition of the victims when Alexander Cullen put his hand on that wall.
126) 0) text: Kevin into the evening air, carrying a bag of stuff. Barzoon standing there in a jogging suit. Furious.

153) 1) dialog: You testified that the defendant called you at four-thirty to ask you to come to his office gym for the purposes of sex.
153) 3) dialog: Mr. Cullen, though, he's not just your lover, is he? He's the boss.
153) 5) dialog: So two hours go by before you act on his request?
153) 11) dialog: Okay.  Stop. (breaking character) This prosecutor is no fool. He's gonna change tempo, attitude, tone of voice -- he's gonna come out with questions you never thought of, just to screw you up. (coaching) So what do we do?
153) 13) dialog: Exactly. (back into it) Is it your testimony, Ms. Block, that between the hours of six-ten and nine-forty you were engaged in sexual congress with the defendant?
153) 15) dialog: At any point during this three hour marathon, Ms. Block, did you lose sight of the defendant?
153) 17) dialog: Did he use the bathroom?
153) 19) dialog: Is he circumcised? (silence) You understand the question?
153) 24) dialog: So is he cut or not?
153) 26) dialog: Which is it?

164) 2) dialog: They don't know. It's bad.   She's falling apart.
164) 4) text: Kevin turns to see Christabella standing beside him. Jackie's concerned expression blossoms into a private, knowing smile now that Kevin has turned away.

There's blood on his shirt. His eyes are raw. At his side, a small suitcase containing her personal effects. More than grief, more than shock, what we notice most is his frighteningly grim determination. Up ahead, a bench. Mrs. Lomax huddled here. Cried out. Empty. Holding herself more tightly as he sets down the suitcase.
197) 2) text: Kevin sits.    If he loses his steel he'll drown.
