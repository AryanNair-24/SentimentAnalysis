197) 0) text: But someplace completely different. Older.        Dark. Echoey. A fluorescent bulb sputtering out. FOOTSTEPS approaching... It's Kevin. And we know instantly that Mary Ann is dead. There's blood on his shirt. His eyes are raw. At his side, a small suitcase containing her personal effects. More than grief, more than shock, what we notice most is his frighteningly grim determination. Up ahead, a bench. Mrs. Lomax huddled here. Cried out. Empty. Holding herself more tightly as he sets down the suitcase.

Working so hard, putting himself through school, I'd never met anybody like that. Knew the Bible, every word, just knew it by heart. Every meal, there he was, at my ear and I just... I didn't want that week to ever end. But it did. He came to say goodbye, it was late, and I started to cry and he said not to worry, 'Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves.' And that just stopped me cold because we'd spent that whole day at Bible study reading Matthew Ten and there was just no way for him to know about that, so I was... I took it as a sign. I let him in. And then everything was different. He was cruel. He was so cruel and I was so ashamed, I thought I'd die...
197) 9) dialog: I promised right there if God would let me back into His grace I would never leave again. I prayed there was a reason this terrible thing had happened. There had to be a reason.

197) 13) dialog: His face -- that night -- I knew it was him and the same time I was confused -- and you were so proud you'd come to New York and done all this on your own, I didn't have the heart to tell you --
197) 15) dialog: (desperate to finish) -- you wondered yourself -- the apartment, the money, all this attention, everything out of nowhere... (pause) Milton. He's your father. (there it is, out loud) Somehow he found us. Tracked you down.
197) 17) dialog: What do you mean?
197) 20) dialog: What are you doing?
197) 22) dialog: No... let it alone! Stay with me. (panicked) Forget about him! We can leave here. We can go home! We don't ever have to see him again!
