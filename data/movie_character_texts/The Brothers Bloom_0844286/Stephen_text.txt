Penelope and Yeungling will stay with the car, Bloom and I will do the handing. PENELOPE You guys seem a little tense. STEPHEN Well I'm not thrilled they set this in Mexico. There could be legitimate reasons, but Mexico's - and I don't want to simplistically vilify an entire country, but Mexico's a horrible place. So we'll be careful.

That's - cackle bladder, in the old days they put fake blood in chicken bladders, so... So you'd escape with the Chink, she'd send you off with a little travelling money and that would be that. PENELOPE Wow. BLOOM But that's not how this one's going to end. I love you now, and I want to get you out of this.

Every moment you shared with her, you were just playing the part of a man falling in love. That's what you're afraid of, right? That you don't know the difference? Or maybe that there is no difference. That that's what love is. PENELOPE We're leaving. STEPHEN (to Bloom) No. You're too scared to leave. You're scared to ride off into a sunset that isn't painted tarpaulin, cause real sunsets are beautiful but they turn into dark uncertain nights. If you were ready for that, you wouldn't be here. The money is in my bedroom. Right behind me. But in my story you don't get the money or the sunset or the girl.

On it, written over and over in a dozen different stylize fonts, is "PENELOPE THE CON ARTIST." Bloom sets the paper down with a snap. BLOOM Go away. Everything Stephen said was true.

PENELOPE But you've got- STEPHEN Your money from the last job, well that's profit, not capital, the three of us have already split it up. So step one: sell the book of hours. PENELOPE I thought it was fake. STEPHEN With all your random expertise we couldn't risk a flat out fake.
