Standing at the top of a tall ladder between two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshel is a rather uninteresting British GIRL: eye-glasses, hair a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare. This is EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love wit her. Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows the dust off it, then places it on a shelf with other boo whose titles all begin with the letter "O".

Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY. And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRA into the next bookshelf. Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. She looks up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshe crashing into the next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf aft bookshelf. Thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and  scattering across the floor. It finally ends as the last  shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. She  opens one eye. Looks left.
