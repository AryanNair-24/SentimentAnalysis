54) 4) text: Called her agent. The JOKER nods in satisfaction and resumes his place on t floor. Like a happy kindergartener, with paste pot and  scissors, he's CLIPPING PHOTOS from a magazine -- horribl scenes of death, destruction, panic, mutilation. One by one, he's PASTING these shots on the blowup of  Gotham city -- all along sidewalk level -- creating a  massive photomontage of ANARCHY IN THE STREETS. We've seen these photos before. VICKI VALE took them... i Corto Maltese.

88) 0) text: The red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCEN liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless  cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays  underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighte emerge from the opening of a hit musical. In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE, his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young s BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder. THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the  sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS pu an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking. IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and  MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousl BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL JOY. And then, without warning -- A HANDGUN enters frame. The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps  protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight. MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at her throat. The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move. The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE. The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The  pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops towa the sidewalk. A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shri we cannot hear -- -- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame. BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a  handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's  purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at t boy. Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around  them. He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that t GUNMAN turns and runs. AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Priz winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medic with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped  tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON. There's only one difference. BRUCE's head is turned away  from us. We can't see his face. And now a HAND enters the frame. Much like the GUNMAN's  hand, but feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing his name,  LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, he BURIES HIS FACE in  GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily at the intruder. But the hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns. Showing us the tear-stained face from the famous photo. A face slack with horror. The horror of his parents' death. and more importantly, the horror that someone would dare violate this most private and terrible of moments. At last we see what BRUCE sees: a WOMAN crouched on the  sidewalk nearby. The WOMAN is holding a camera. The WOMAN is smiling prettily at BRUCE. The WOMAN is VICKI VALE. A FLASHBULB EXPLODES. FILLING. THE SCREEN with its blindi white light, SCORCHING OUT THE IMAGE as a HARSH RINGING  SOUND cuts through the silence.
