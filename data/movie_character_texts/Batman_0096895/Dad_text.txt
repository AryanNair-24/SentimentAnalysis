Street hustlers slap high- fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to kno each other... with one conspicuous exception: A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring  straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down th main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and  now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift i the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street.

They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGUR in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved ha brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a bric wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across  the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who' already searching for DAD's wallet.
