Street hustlers slap high- fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to kno each other... with one conspicuous exception: A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring  straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down th main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and  now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift i the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street.

4) 0) text: A deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, and JIMMY take a deep breat and march down the darkened street. A VOICE startles them VOICE
4) 1) text: Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar? The VOICE belongs to a DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty,  acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his pa uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.' MOM, DAD, and JIMMY pause for the merest of seconds, then move on -- pretending not to hear. DERELICT
4) 3) text: One dollar, man. Are you deaf? Are you deaf? -- Do you speak English?? By now the TOURISTS are halfway across the street.  Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following. They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGUR in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved ha brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a bric wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across  the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who' already searching for DAD's wallet. MOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to  snap -- so  the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains hi gun on JIMMY. STREET PUNK

And then -- casually,  without a moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF T ROOF, INTO MIDAIR. Trembling, NICK crawls to the ledge and looks over...  finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman. NICK is still screaming as we PAN UP to the bilious yello globe of Gotham's moon. MAIN CREDITS ROLL: BATMAN

A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. COLORS BURST in a wild  pyrotechnic display. COPS stumble backwards, momentarily  dazzled, as a THICK WALL OF BLACK SMOKE conceals BATMAN  from view. A TINY GRAPPLING HOOK rockets out of the dense curling  cloud and CATCHES on a catwalk overhead. COP
29) 16) text: There's terror everywhere. Some types are just more -- familiar than others. For a moment BRUCE seems to be drifting back into his  familiar 'preoccupied' mode. VICKI laughs apologetically. VICKI

37) 1) text: That you, sugar bumps? GRISSOM waddles in unsuspectingly from the adjoining room He's fresh out of the shower, a towel wrapped around his  impressive girth. He's using a smaller towel to dry his  hair, and so it's a moment before he sees the bundled-up  figure at his desk. GRISSOM (cont.)

59) 3) text: I know what you're saying. Where can I buy these fine, fine products? Well, that's the gag, folks, you never know. Chances are... you've bought 'em already!!! As his RANT CONTINUES, we SEE: -    A YOUNG MAN watching the bedroom TV as he dresses fo a date. He's got an aerosol deodorant can poised under  one arm, ready to spray. He looks down at the can,  suddenly uncertain. Could it be...? -    A FAMILY in their kitchen, eyeing a 12-inch portable as MOM serves dinner. They dig in automatically, then  FREEZE with their forks in midair. -    A MIDDLE-AGED MATRON at the living-room TV. Shocked, she calls to her husband -- and gets no reply. We  FOLLOW HER to the bathroom door. On the floor she sees AN OVERTURNED SHAMPOO BOTTLE.  Then: her HUSBAND, slumped down in the tub, a lethal  GRIN on his face. She lets out a SHRIEK.
67) 15) text: Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist. People might like to see the face behind the makeup. JOKER (momentarily puzzled)
67) 18) text: Silly little TWIT -- I can't take you ANYWHERE! He sits back and grins expectantly. VICKI is thoroughly  nonplussed by this bizarre outburst. A moment passes. He obviously wants her to do something, but she hasn't got a clue as to what it is. Growing impatient now, he  POINTS at the WATER GLASS: JOKER (cont.)

88) 0) text: The red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCEN liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless  cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays  underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighte emerge from the opening of a hit musical. In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE, his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young s BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder. THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the  sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS pu an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking. IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and  MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousl BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL JOY. And then, without warning -- A HANDGUN enters frame. The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps  protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight. MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at her throat. The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move. The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE. The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The  pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops towa the sidewalk. A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shri we cannot hear -- -- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame. BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a  handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's  purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at t boy. Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around  them. He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that t GUNMAN turns and runs. AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Priz winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medic with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped  tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON. There's only one difference. BRUCE's head is turned away  from us. We can't see his face. And now a HAND enters the frame. Much like the GUNMAN's  hand, but feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing his name,  LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, he BURIES HIS FACE in  GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily at the intruder. But the hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns. Showing us the tear-stained face from the famous photo. A face slack with horror. The horror of his parents' death. and more importantly, the horror that someone would dare violate this most private and terrible of moments. At last we see what BRUCE sees: a WOMAN crouched on the  sidewalk nearby. The WOMAN is holding a camera. The WOMAN is smiling prettily at BRUCE. The WOMAN is VICKI VALE. A FLASHBULB EXPLODES. FILLING. THE SCREEN with its blindi white light, SCORCHING OUT THE IMAGE as a HARSH RINGING  SOUND cuts through the silence.

108) 14) text: Set it down by the door. On the left-hand side. The DELIVERY BOY sets the package down and wanders off,  tipless, muttering something about "cheap shits." After a moment's interval, BRUCE opens the door and bends to pick up the mysterious package. Another brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON. VICKI
109) 4) text: ... Where are you calling from? As VICKI struggles to keep the conversation alive, BRUCE  rushes into the living room and crouches beside his LAPTO COMPUTER.

Then they HEAD FOR THE TREES as the BATWING DIVES DIRECTLY AT THE  TRUCKS, firing THREE ARMOR-PIERCING SHELLS... and  destroying the JOKER's lethal cargo once and for all.

The muzzle of a CANNON breaks through the  parade decorations. And one moment later...  A ROSE-COVERED TANK is rumbling up Broad Avenue!
