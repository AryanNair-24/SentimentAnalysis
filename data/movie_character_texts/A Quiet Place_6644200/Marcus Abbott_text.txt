The right hand then slowly moves to the ignition block... turns. There is no sound. After a moment, the hand turns again...again without sound. The hand turns a third time. this time, the hand begins to bob ever so slightly... as the old car has started up. As the hand retracts: WE PULL BACK to reveal... The little brother. This is MAR ABBOTT, now 10. Moving ever so slightly, MARCUS is obviou pretending to drive... though his impassive face betrays idea that he is having any fun.
