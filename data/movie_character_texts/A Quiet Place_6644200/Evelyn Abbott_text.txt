The pink lit sand, now combined with a sound like the ocean, feels serene, almost otherworldly. Slowly coming into frame, we see the face of... the daugh This is REGAN ABBOTT. Her hair is much longer. She is now TWO YEARS OLDER, 12. She just looks... different. REGAN lays in the sand with eyes closed... but she is not asleep. With her brow furrowed and her closed eyes darting back a forth she looks oddly pained... almost as if she is wishi herself to another place. There is movement in her hands as her fingers caress an object. Her eyes suddenly POP OPEN as she sits up violently CLOSE INTO OUR FRAME! She looks around with eyes wet and red, attempting to regain her bearings. WE SLOWLY MOVE AROUND her to see what she sees and are me with... a jarringly incongruous landscape! Instead of a glistening ocean, there in front of REGAN stand the tall swaying stalks of... A CORNFIELD. As REGAN looks to her lap WE SLOWLY TRAVEL DOWN to reveal she is holding THE TOY SHUTTLE. As she maneuvers it throu her fingers we see the shuttle is damaged... there are 2 large gouges in the fuselage. Suddenly... Something startles her as she snaps her head the side! WE GO CLOSE on her hand driving the TOY SHUTTLE into the sand, not wanting it to be seen. Now ONLY THE SHUTTLE'S T is exposed in the foreground as we see a figure walking toward REGAN. Coming into focus is... her mother. This is EVELYN ABBOTT EVELYN too has changed. Hair longer... frame lower. She carries a basket of vegetables. She is bare foot. EVELYN stops and looks down at her daughter giving her a comforting smile. REGAN can't seem to return the same.

Lodged against the walls and across the ceiling are wooden beams In between each beam are varying stages of an elaborate process of insulation and sound proofing that consists of thick layer of newspaper as a base and then blankets and pillows squeezed in on top. There is a hay bale up agains one wall and a mattress leaned up against another. In the middle of the room, MARCUS walks past... EVELYN, w is bent over behind an odd wooden box.
