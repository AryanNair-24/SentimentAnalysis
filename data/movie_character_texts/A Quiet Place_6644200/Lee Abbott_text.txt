The pink lit sand, now combined with a sound like the ocean, feels serene, almost otherworldly. Slowly coming into frame, we see the face of... the daugh This is REGAN ABBOTT. Her hair is much longer. She is now TWO YEARS OLDER, 12. She just looks... different. REGAN lays in the sand with eyes closed... but she is not asleep. With her brow furrowed and her closed eyes darting back a forth she looks oddly pained... almost as if she is wishi herself to another place. There is movement in her hands as her fingers caress an object. Her eyes suddenly POP OPEN as she sits up violently CLOSE INTO OUR FRAME! She looks around with eyes wet and red, attempting to regain her bearings. WE SLOWLY MOVE AROUND her to see what she sees and are me with... a jarringly incongruous landscape! Instead of a glistening ocean, there in front of REGAN stand the tall swaying stalks of... A CORNFIELD. As REGAN looks to her lap WE SLOWLY TRAVEL DOWN to reveal she is holding THE TOY SHUTTLE. As she maneuvers it throu her fingers we see the shuttle is damaged... there are 2 large gouges in the fuselage. Suddenly... Something startles her as she snaps her head the side! WE GO CLOSE on her hand driving the TOY SHUTTLE into the sand, not wanting it to be seen. Now ONLY THE SHUTTLE'S T is exposed in the foreground as we see a figure walking toward REGAN. Coming into focus is... her mother. This is EVELYN ABBOTT EVELYN too has changed. Hair longer... frame lower. She carries a basket of vegetables. She is bare foot. EVELYN stops and looks down at her daughter giving her a comforting smile. REGAN can't seem to return the same.

He lands in the san without a sound and begins to walk, head held low, toward dark figure... who reaches his hand out and briefly touch Marcus' shoulder. Marcus walks straight past. As MARCUS exits we BOOM UP the dark figure as it turns, revealing... LEON ABBOTT (LEE), 38. LEE too has changed, though much more obviously. He has lost weight on his str farmer frame, he wears a beard and his sunken eyes indica that he hasn't slept well... in a long time. WE PULL BACK WIDE to reveal the sea of farm equipment sit front of a long, dilapidated, work shed roof... a makeshi repair shop. The word `REPAIR' is written in flaking whit paint that clings to the wood above.
18) 0) text: ON THE BACK OF... LEE, perched on what looks like the top the world. From this great height we get our first WIDE SHOT of the large farm that we now see sits in a clearing on a ridge. surrounded by the tangled forest of the APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. A puff of smoke rises from LEE's silhouette as he suddenl raises a hand into frame... and checks his watch. A momen later... As if on cue... A line of CHRISTMAS LIGHTS flicker to life above the wide sand path REGAN was laying on. Another line of white Christmas lights flicker on... this time revealing a path that connects the weathered red BAR to an old white FARMHOUSE. Then another line of lights... and another! Like the image of a city power grid coming b to life, we see a labyrinth of countless sand paths, meticulously laid out, illuminate all over the farm in a beautiful expanse. NOW IN PROFILE, LEE stares down... seemingly at nothing. unfiltered cigarette burns to his fingers, causing LEE to snap out of his stupor. He looks around at the horizon, i officially sundown. He reaches for a plastic bottle of... Lighter fluid... and sprays all its contents into a shall metal drum in front of him. Another cigarette appears from below frame. He puts it in mouth and then reaches his hands... into his jacket. His right arm jiggles slightly. There is no sound. His arm jiggles again. Then from his jacket, LEE pulls... a FULLY LIGHTER, that he protects from the wind. He lights his cigarette and then leans his hands to the metal drum... A HUGE FLAME ERUPTS. In the glowing orange we see LEE take a long drag of his cigarette. His face has no affect. After several moments flame begins to weaken and slowly fade. Suddenly, far FAR off in the distance on the ridge... ANO FLAME ILLUMINATES. LEE doesn't even look up. Then, miles past the first... ANOTHER FLAME!... THEN ANOTHER! Until w can see behind LEE 5 glowing fires scattered far off acro the ridge. ON LEE as he glances over and registers... then back to staring front as we:

Suddenly, through the mirror leaning on the wall, LEE sees her... B does not turn.
22) 0) text: REGAN and MARCUS lie on the floor playing... Monopoly. By the dim light of an oil lantern... we can see the game board is the same, but the pieces are small colored bobbl of wool, the kind you would find on a children's Christma sweater. The houses and hotels are empty sugar packets, b and pink. And the money?... Small pieces of green, red, b and orange fabric rectangles... all equally sized. MARCUS is five spaces away from his sister's hotel on Boardwalk. He takes a sip of water and places the cup on of a tall crate being used as a makeshift side table. MAR looks at his sister, who can't hide her smile. He mimes a prayer before rolling the dice on the dirt floor, where i makes no noise............... 5! MARCUS slowly looks up to REGAN, knowing his fate. REGAN smiles pointedly and then reaches for MARCUS' money. As MARCUS thrusts his arm back to protect his bank, his elbo hits the oil lantern!! A BOOMING CRASH!!!! As the oil lantern hits the ground an shatters. THE SOUND FEELS HUGE!.. AS IT IS THE FIRST BIG SOUND WE'VE HEARD! FIRE ERUPTS ON THE FLOOR!!! The childr stare frozen in horror! LEE immediately jumps up from the table and instinctively grabs a quilt and throws it on the fire. With a few silen pats... the fire is gone.

Suddenly LEE's bare feet enter frame... and then a large hiking backpack enters frame next to him. ON LEE as we see a momentary glimpse into the painstaking and never ending, workload that goes into maintaining thi farm. CLOSE on hands as LEE's bare fingers gouge into the unforgiving earth at the edge of the sand path to divert water. Stones come into frame to form a temporary wall. Then... LEE hoists, the very obviously heavy, hiking bag his knee. He then slowly and silently undoes a handmade f at the bottom of the backpack. From the opening of the ba pours... SAND.

He tries again... she pushes again... even harder. LEE looks at his daughter as she looks at him... her veno face, betrayed by the large tears that roll down her chee After a long moment... REGAN snatches the hearing aid fro her father's hand and walks away.
