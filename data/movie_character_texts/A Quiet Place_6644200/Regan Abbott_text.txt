The pink lit sand, now combined with a sound like the ocean, feels serene, almost otherworldly. Slowly coming into frame, we see the face of... the daugh This is REGAN ABBOTT. Her hair is much longer. She is now TWO YEARS OLDER, 12. She just looks... different. REGAN lays in the sand with eyes closed... but she is not asleep. With her brow furrowed and her closed eyes darting back a forth she looks oddly pained... almost as if she is wishi herself to another place. There is movement in her hands as her fingers caress an object. Her eyes suddenly POP OPEN as she sits up violently CLOSE INTO OUR FRAME! She looks around with eyes wet and red, attempting to regain her bearings. WE SLOWLY MOVE AROUND her to see what she sees and are me with... a jarringly incongruous landscape! Instead of a glistening ocean, there in front of REGAN stand the tall swaying stalks of... A CORNFIELD. As REGAN looks to her lap WE SLOWLY TRAVEL DOWN to reveal she is holding THE TOY SHUTTLE. As she maneuvers it throu her fingers we see the shuttle is damaged... there are 2 large gouges in the fuselage. Suddenly... Something startles her as she snaps her head the side! WE GO CLOSE on her hand driving the TOY SHUTTLE into the sand, not wanting it to be seen. Now ONLY THE SHUTTLE'S T is exposed in the foreground as we see a figure walking toward REGAN. Coming into focus is... her mother. This is EVELYN ABBOTT EVELYN too has changed. Hair longer... frame lower. She carries a basket of vegetables. She is bare foot. EVELYN stops and looks down at her daughter giving her a comforting smile. REGAN can't seem to return the same.

From this great height we get our first WIDE SHOT of the large farm that we now see sits in a clearing on a ridge. surrounded by the tangled forest of the APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. A puff of smoke rises from LEE's silhouette as he suddenl raises a hand into frame... and checks his watch. A momen later... As if on cue... A line of CHRISTMAS LIGHTS flicker to life above the wide sand path REGAN was laying on. Another line of white Christmas lights flicker on... this time revealing a path that connects the weathered red BAR to an old white FARMHOUSE. Then another line of lights... and another! Like the image of a city power grid coming b to life, we see a labyrinth of countless sand paths, meticulously laid out, illuminate all over the farm in a beautiful expanse. NOW IN PROFILE, LEE stares down... seemingly at nothing. unfiltered cigarette burns to his fingers, causing LEE to snap out of his stupor. He looks around at the horizon, i officially sundown. He reaches for a plastic bottle of... Lighter fluid... and sprays all its contents into a shall metal drum in front of him. Another cigarette appears from below frame. He puts it in mouth and then reaches his hands... into his jacket. His right arm jiggles slightly. There is no sound. His arm jiggles again. Then from his jacket, LEE pulls... a FULLY LIGHTER, that he protects from the wind. He lights his cigarette and then leans his hands to the metal drum... A HUGE FLAME ERUPTS. In the glowing orange we see LEE take a long drag of his cigarette. His face has no affect. After several moments flame begins to weaken and slowly fade. Suddenly, far FAR off in the distance on the ridge... ANO FLAME ILLUMINATES. LEE doesn't even look up. Then, miles past the first... ANOTHER FLAME!... THEN ANOTHER! Until w can see behind LEE 5 glowing fires scattered far off acro the ridge. ON LEE as he glances over and registers... then back to staring front as we:

REGAN arrives at the threshold of LEE and EVELYN's bedroo LEE is faced away from her, washing his face in a long tr like sink that runs the length of the room. Suddenly, through the mirror leaning on the wall, LEE sees her... B does not turn.
22) 0) text: REGAN and MARCUS lie on the floor playing... Monopoly. By the dim light of an oil lantern... we can see the game board is the same, but the pieces are small colored bobbl of wool, the kind you would find on a children's Christma sweater. The houses and hotels are empty sugar packets, b and pink. And the money?... Small pieces of green, red, b and orange fabric rectangles... all equally sized. MARCUS is five spaces away from his sister's hotel on Boardwalk. He takes a sip of water and places the cup on of a tall crate being used as a makeshift side table. MAR looks at his sister, who can't hide her smile. He mimes a prayer before rolling the dice on the dirt floor, where i makes no noise............... 5! MARCUS slowly looks up to REGAN, knowing his fate. REGAN smiles pointedly and then reaches for MARCUS' money. As MARCUS thrusts his arm back to protect his bank, his elbo hits the oil lantern!! A BOOMING CRASH!!!! As the oil lantern hits the ground an shatters. THE SOUND FEELS HUGE!.. AS IT IS THE FIRST BIG SOUND WE'VE HEARD! FIRE ERUPTS ON THE FLOOR!!! The childr stare frozen in horror! LEE immediately jumps up from the table and instinctively grabs a quilt and throws it on the fire. With a few silen pats... the fire is gone.

Just then, REGAN takes a dramatically long step inside, placing her foot down... directly on the first colored marking... silence. Looking almost relieved, REGAN once again scans the floor and then focuses on another marking She takes another long step, this time far to her right.. and touches down on the next marking... silence. It almos looks like she's playing `TWISTER'. Getting more confiden she scans the room, finds another spot and steps quickly.

On the ground we now see all ki of electronic equipment and tools.

More reminiscent of a soldier returning to a battlefield, then a girl returning to a farm, we see countless streamers of firework smoke still falling gracefully from the sky. The tips of dry cornstalks flicker... alight with small flames. Off in the distance see... lights of the SILO. Shining like a beacon. REGAN walks along the eerie shadows of corn stalks when suddenly at her feet... cracks of light. REGAN lowers to her knees and puts her head to the ground see... a bright light, cutting through the bottom of the stalks of corn. Suddenly, the pliers REGAN used to work o the TOY SHUTTLE... slip out of the pocket of her dress...

And then, there in the center of the clearing, lit by the flashlight... one half of a deer carcass. ... No sign of MARCUS... REGAN slowly bends down to pick up the flashlight when suddenly... THE CARCASS MOVES! REGAN jumps back, terrified!!! Then from under the neck of the deer... a hand!! REGAN runs over and pushes the carcass off of... MARCUS, has been safely lying underneath. Covered in blood, he scrambles to try to get to his feet. REGAN grabs him and holds him tight. She places her finge to her lips... just like her dad. She looks around to see if they have a chance to run... a then thinks better of it. She looks back to her brother.. and places her hand on his chest. WE RISE above the clearing, above the overgrown tractor.. and once again into the night.

REGAN turns her head... and looks up. REGAN's POV as we climb higher and higher... to the top o the SILO!

REGAN walks around the fire looking out across the farm f any sign of her father. Just as the fire is about to die out, REGAN walks back an squirts the last remaining fluid from the bottle. The fir rages again and illuminates the two children... as well a the fading hope on their faces. The fire begins to die down again. REGAN rummages in the picking up the empty bottles of lighter fluid and shaking them frantically... She shakes the last empty bottle... And slumps down... defeated... scared. In the last moments of the dying flame...

WE GO EXTREME CLOSE on her turning the tiny dial on top o her hearing aid. As she does... she places her other hand her ear and rubs her fingers together, hoping to hear a sound.... Nothing. REGAN turns the dial even more... nothing. REGAN immediately rolls over, frustrated. Sitting directl in her view, on his dad's small stool... is MARCUS lookin out hopefully to the farm.

EVELYN picks the baby out from a box and grabs MARCUS tig We watch REGAN's face as she enters her father's workspac FOR THE FIRST TIME!!! She is stunned. OVER REGAN as she steps down and begins to walk through t room. Her eyes track, AS WE DID WHEN WE FIRST SAW THE ROO past the TOWERING WALL OF SECURITY MONITORS... along the of NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS, NOTES, AND SCIENTIFIC IMAGES. Her eyes continue now toward her father's WORK STATION. THROU BOXES OF SALVAGED ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT and onto... LEE'S PHONES. REGAN picks up the head phones and follows the wire... TO HER FATHER'S HAM RADIO. She looks down at the knob her father used to search... and the microphone he u to reach out. For the first time REGAN sees... REGAN REALIZES... THIS is what her father was doing all this ti THIS is what he was doing... FOR THEM! ON REGAN taking al this in, when her eyes move just slightly to the side... she freezes.
