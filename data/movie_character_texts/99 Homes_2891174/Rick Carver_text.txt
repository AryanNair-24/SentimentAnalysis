One year later, he took a home equity loan and got another $200,000 that he used to buy that sweet little Yellowfin for fishing trips and to take Mrs. Hester to Tahiti. By the time this home was worth half what he’d borrowed, he just quit paying.

22) 11) dialog: Now get everything else and meet me over there. 40. Points at the house next door.
24) 2) dialog: Install everything - patch the tile, caulk the cabinets and connect the gas line when you bring in the appliances.
24) 4) dialog: I’m selling this home for Fannie Mae. I can’t do that if there’s no kitchen, can I?
24) 6) dialog: So who just paid me $33,000 to buy new cabinets, appliances and a counter-top plus labor?

That was my job. - In 2006, Robert and Julia Tanner borrowed 30 grand to put an enclosed patio on their home which they had managed to live without for 25 years. (MORE )
43) 31) dialog: Ask them when they’re spitting in your face as you walk them to the curb. Ask the banks why they gave them an adjustable rate mortgage. Ask the government why they lifted all regulations and turned a blind eye. You, the Tanners, the banks, Washington and every other homeowner and investor from here to China turned my life into evictions. I’m not an aristocrat. I wasn’t born into it. My dad was a roofer. I grew up on construction sites watching him work his ass off until he fell from a townhouse. A lifetime of insurance payments and they dropped him before he could buy a wheelchair but only after they got him hooked on pain killers. Do you think I’m going to let that happen to me? Do you think America 2010 gives one damn about Carver or Nash? America doesn’t bail out the losers. America was built by bailing out the winners. By rigging a nation of the winners, by the winners, for the winners. Do you go to church Nash? Do you?

62) 30) dialog: This Bank of Santa Fe deal is like one giant ATM machine. What can I do to get Vesic back into those homes?
62) 32) dialog: How about this: I’1l put appliances back in those 15 homes - free of charge - and you move The Bank of Santa Fe from Ortiz over to me. Khanna smiles. Rick is uncertain why...
63) 2) dialog: For the Santa Fe deal I’1l give you 6% of my share. You'll end up with around $63,000 pre-tax.
63) 4) dialog: You used to dream about one home. Now it’s 100.
63) 7) dialog: Fuck dreams. To 100 homes.
65) 1) dialog: Uh-oh. The Zombie is coming to get me. Dennis slumps on the dock beside him, drunk. Thinks.

65) 10) dialog: So. Nash. The sun is coming up and here we are. What do you think?
65) 12) dialog: You wanted to kill me once. Now you’re going to make a lot of money.
65) 17) dialog: It's gotta be listed for sale on the MLS first. Few more weeks.
65) 19) dialog: Just pick another one. You got the money now, buy whatever you want. There's plenty of homes in the sea. Like I said, don’t get emotional about real estate, Nash! They’re boxes. You listening? Big boxes, small boxes. What matters is how Many you got. You’re gonna have more properties than women to fill ‘em with. You know that, right? Buy one for your mom, one of your kid and one for yourself. What do I care? Yes sir, 100 homes...
