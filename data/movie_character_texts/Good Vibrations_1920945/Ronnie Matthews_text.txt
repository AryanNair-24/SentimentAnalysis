38) 10) dialog: OK, now that we’ve cleared the air a bit... this is ‘Big Time’. At guitarist BRIAN YOUNG’s opening riff the crowd surges forward. Suddenly the fluorescent stage-light falls from the ceiling. RUDI play on regardless in the gloom. FANGS grabs the light, still lit, and swings it above his head. TERRI looks around him - at the kids, at the band, at the waving light - and it is all too much. He starts to cry. Then he jumps up and down with everyone else.

Searches in the other pocket, pulls out his matches. He tries to light a cigarette, but his hand shakes so much it takes him two matches. The flags on the lampposts when he looks up have changed from red, white and blue to green, white and orange. TERR sits forward in his seat. Something has caught his eye. Reflected on the windows a street protest fronted by WOME wearing only blankets, carrying pictures of young IRA men above the words ‘Political Prisoner’. OTHERS have posters saying ‘Smash H Block’. The whole thing is eerily silent. EXT. BELFAST STREET — DAY 121 A wall with a single poster for a Smash H Block rally, 3r March 1979. TERRI slaps a Harp poster over it and walks away.

156) 4) dialog: (tongue in cheek, mostly) Well you fucked up that, and you fucked up this, so fuck knows, Terri, why we’re doing this... A door opens at the far end of the hall. A balding, beard figure in a blazer comes walking towards them. TERRI and DAVE peer at him, looks of recognition and disbelief. RONNIE has spotted the figure now as well.
