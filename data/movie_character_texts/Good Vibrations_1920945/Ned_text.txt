6) 0) text: TERRI and RUTH are surrounded by the very FRIENDS Terri i invoking: swaying to music, laughing, animated. In the middle of the floor three men clink shorts glasses: MARTY less heavy (and wearing a CND badge); NED, and ANDY, with Zapata moustache.
14) 0) text: TERRI walks away from Sorting Office opening a package: records. He walks on past boarded-up shops. A car appears on the far side of the street, traveling in the opposite direction. 19 20 14. TERRI pulls his chin down into his collar as it passes hi The sound of the car fades into the distance, leaving onl TERRI’s footsteps. Another car appears, moving slower, faces at the windows. TERRI retreats further into his collar. When the car has travelled a few yards beyond him it does a U-turn and before TERRI has time to run pulls up at the kerbside. A THUG jumps out. He pulls TERRI’s coat over his head and drags him towards the car. TERRI resists. At one stage his head is inside the car. He and the drive redheaded NED, are eye to eye.
14) 2) dialog: (lifting a wheel brace) Here, hit him a whack with this. TERRI in his panic flails, catching NED’s cheek with the record bag. He manages to break free, leaving his coat, sweater, and shirt in the hands of the THUG. Somehow he’s managed to hold on to the bag. He runs. THUG gets out and starts to give chase. Headlights appear further up the street.

26) 0) text: TERRI enters, the very incarnation of Johnny Guitar Watson’s ‘Gangster of Love’, a box under each arm. MARTY is there with a group of REPUBLICAN PARAMILITARIES (the FRIENDS from the 1968 Harp Bar), among them NED, bruising still around his eye. They watch TERRI stop before their table. He looks over h shoulder. ANDY enters with other LOYALIST PARAMILITARIES (more of the FRIENDS). The REPUBLICAN PARAMILITARIES instinctively rise from their seats hands going towards their jackets.

38) 0) text: There are people all right. Young people. PUNKS. It’s another city, another world entirely. The journey from the door to the bar is a crash course in teen vice, 1978 vintage: gropings, playful headbuttings, surreptitious glue-sniffing. TERRI and DAVE squeeze in at the bar. DAVE takes out a pound note, conspicuous amid the PUNKS counting out their coins so of course the BARMAN makes straight for him. The PUNKS glare. TERRI turns to look into the room. On a stage lit by a single fluorescent bulb, four crop- haired teenagers are wrenching out a song (basic even for punk) from their instruments. These are the OUTCASTS. Lead singer GREG COWAN exercises his snarl. Guitarist GETTY, shirt off, concentrates so hard on his guitar, he doesn’t notice the girls concentrating on him. Suddenly a number of RUC MEN come in and start nabbing anyone who looks underage (and plenty do), taking names, asking for pockets to be turned out. 26. TERRI pushes his way through the crowd and buttonholes an RUC MAN, writing down the name of a pink-haired PUNK GIRL
