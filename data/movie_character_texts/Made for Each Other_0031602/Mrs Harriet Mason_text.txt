6) 11) dialog: (to Jane) John's so young and impulsive...
6) 13) dialog: (to Jane) Are you visiting relatives here in New York, my dear?
6) 16) dialog: (horrified) From Boston? Together? Last night?
6) 18) dialog: Engaged!
6) 20) dialog: Well I should think it was sudden! What did your family have to say about it?
6) 22) dialog: Oh. (there is implied criticism in the syllable) Didn't John say something about your taking a course in journalism?
6) 25) dialog: (her face brightens) Oh -- My dear, if you have a talent for writing -- (she becomes suddenly motherly) Take my advice and develop it while you're young. One needs all one's time and energy for a career.
6) 27) dialog: Oh, indeed! Emphatically! That's why one mustn't rush into it pell-mell. Marriage is a business -- a very serious business. A partnership in the strictest sense of the word. One must prepare for it. There are so many things to learn. Jane looks at Johnny.
6) 29) dialog: I hope and pray that that day will not come for many years!
6) 31) dialog: Emphatically not! There's no reason for Jane to develop into a little household drudge. Oh, I hope you understand I have nothing against Jane. In fact, I like her -- I like her very much.

7) 5) dialog: I wish you every possible happiness and joy. (her voice trembles) I think perhaps I'd better go to bed. I'm all right. I'm all right. (she starts to exit, then turns with a sudden grey thought) I'll find a place to live, of course.
7) 8) dialog: (shakes her head desolately) Well, we'll see.
9) 2) dialog: (to Jane) Don't let him eat too many strawberries.
9) 4) dialog: He gets rashes. And don't forget to make him wear his raincoat in London.
9) 6) dialog: He had pneumonia once.

19) 0) dialog: 
19) 1) dialog: You seem to think I've never done this before.
21) 1) dialog: You have the wine glasses on the wrong side, Annie.
21) 3) dialog: (shakes her head) The right side was the water glasses, Annie. Annie exits to kitchen in a huff, giving the swinging doo push that causes it to swing violently. Mrs. Mason takes floral center-piece off the table and brings it over to t sideboard. Jane enters from bedroom, her hair in a net an wearing a house robe.
21) 5) dialog: Isn't it a little crowded? Jane sees that the center-piece has been removed.

21) 12) dialog: Certainly not. (reminiscently) You know, I thought at one time that John and Eunice Doolittle --
21) 14) dialog: But there was nothing in it... Buta lovely girl!
21) 16) dialog: Of course, dear. (she exits to kitchen)
22) 1) dialog: I think you have too many on the plate, Annie. And shouldn't they be garnished? Where's the silver tray -- the one I gave them?
22) 3) dialog: I'll fix the canapes for you, Annie, since you seem to have so much to do. (tastes salad dressing) A little too much vinegar in your salad dressing, Annie, I'm afraid.
22) 5) dialog: (looks toward stove) Oh, your potatoes aren't going to burn, are they? I'm afraid you put them on too early. Annie slams down mixing spoon and starts savagely out of kitchen.
26) 2) dialog: Watch the potatoes, Annie! Annie hits the door a smack and it swings violently behin her as she enters kitchen. Jane enters from living room a proceeds toward Mrs. Mason.
26) 5) dialog: (crucified) You asked me to see about the canapes --
26) 7) dialog: (at same time) Well -- I was only trying to help. A whistle from the living room interrupts them.
30) 10) dialog: (answering Doolittle) I shouldn't think so. Surely it's a question of merit --
43) 2) dialog: Be sure you soap his head thoroughly. It prevents cradle-cap.
43) 4) dialog: (more baby talk to baby) Ittie Johnny doesn't want nasty old cradle-cap, does oo?
43) 7) dialog: If you'd let me show you how --
43) 9) dialog: You don't rub the baby dry. You just pat him.
43) 11) dialog: He looks red. Maybe the water was too hot.
43) 13) dialog: (to baby in baby talk) Was its 'ittle water too hot for ittie Johnny?
43) 17) dialog: Be careful of his little head, my dear.

44) 3) dialog: (with maddening tolerance of her daughter-in-law's stupidity) I'm sorry, my dear, but it's colic... He's been crying for five minutes. Jane closes her eyes and controls herself with effort.
44) 11) text: Again Jane goes to chair and sinks down wearily. The door rings. Johnny exits to answer it. Jane looks at the conte baby, then speaks to Mrs. Mason:
44) 13) dialog: If he were fed on time he wouldn't cry.
44) 15) dialog: (interrupting) Too bad he has to be fed on a bottle.
44) 17) dialog: John never saw a bottle till he was six months old.
44) 20) dialog: What's that, my dear?
44) 31) dialog: (very superior) I think it's very considerate of Judge Doolittle to think about the baby's future.
44) 35) dialog: (with demure over- sweetness) You should have taken that into consideration, my dear, before you rented this apartment.
44) 37) dialog: If my own room weren't so small --
44) 61) dialog: (straightens and shakes her head condescendingly) That's gas!

65) 0) text: (New Year's Eve) The room presents a sorry contrast to the gay revelry go on outside. There is a distinct aura of let-down and depression. Sitting in an easy chair is Mrs. Mason a shaw over her shoulder, sniffing at a tube of benzedrine and q miserable from a cold. Johnny, in evening clothes, is spr on a window seat playing with the baby's toy cat, winding up and listening morosely to the music-box tune. The only sound, except for what drifts in from the celebration in street, is the tune from the music-box. Jane's wrap and Johnny's overcoat are draped over a chair.
65) 7) dialog: (sniffing) Perhaps he forgot all about it.
65) 12) dialog: Isn't the party also to announce his engagement to Eunice Doolittle?
65) 14) dialog: Well, perhaps he thought it might be a little awkward to have you and Jane at his engagement party.
65) 17) dialog: (almost as if she's talking to herself) All the same it might be awkward.
66) 3) dialog: (talking through her head cold) All babies have sniffles this time of the year.
66) 5) dialog: That's simply ridiculous! Matter of fact, I caught my cold from the baby. He's had sniffles all day. When I took his temperature --
66) 7) dialog: He certainly didn't! He had no temperature.
66) 9) dialog: I suppose I ought to stay in my room all day!
66) 11) dialog: Heaven knows I try to earn my room and board by being as helpful as I can!
66) 13) dialog: It's just like any other day as far as I'm concerned. (with rising self- pity) You're both perfectly willing to leave me all alone to wait for the New Year, when perhaps it's the last New Year I'll ever see.
68) 3) dialog: You know I get indigestion if I eat just before I go to bed. (sighs, looks over at chicken) Maybe there'll be some left over for me tomorrow. I never did approve of Lily -- she's much too forward -- but I do miss her cooking!
68) 9) dialog: Times are different now. When I was married, every well brought up girl knew something about cooking. Jane suddenly explodes, slams down the book in her hand.
68) 10) dialog: (turning) Why, Jane -- what is it?
68) 13) dialog: I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about!
68) 17) dialog: (indignant) I've done nothing of the sort! But they were engaged.
68) 19) dialog: Not what you'd call engaged, perhaps --
68) 21) dialog: I can't understand why she's so touchy about it.
68) 24) dialog: (tosses her head) No -- let her go on. She can say anything she likes -- I know my place here. I'm only a guest -- an unwelcome guest.
68) 27) dialog: (violently) It's her house!
68) 31) dialog: I do the best I can to help!
68) 35) dialog: Just because I happened to mention that John and Eunice Doolittle --
83) 11) dialog: Jane, dear -- Jane -- please...
83) 19) dialog: (sympathetically) I know, dear, I know... But you mustn't feel that way. You mustn't let John know you feel that way... He loves the baby too... (there is a very slight choke in her throat) Almost as much as he loves you.
83) 21) dialog: (simply) He'll have you, Jane... And you'll have him... (Jane makes no comment. Mrs. Mason continues) And you can't be lonely... either of you... as long as you have each other... (she looks away) Do you know when you're really lonely? It's when you have no one to share things with... not even a loss... (she can't go further in her revelation)
83) 23) dialog: I wasn't -- always -- a bitter old woman... I wasn't always a pest and a nuisance... (she breaks) ...not when I had someone to share things with. Jane takes her into her arms, and now Jane comforts her, whose front breaks, and who sobs against Jane.
83) 24) dialog: (muffled) And now the baby... Oh, my baby's baby...
101) 12) dialog: We had to rush down the minute it happened!
