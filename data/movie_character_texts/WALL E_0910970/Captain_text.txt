A sea of thinking lights. 33. A CAPTAIN'S WHEEL automatically steers. Gopher drives into the middle of the room. Beeps. Suddenly the wheel disengages. The autopilot (AUTO). A single camera eye lights up its center. A periscope stem connects Auto to the ceiling. Slides along rails up to Gopher, who salutes. Auto eyes Eve. Scans her. Wally sneaks back into the shadows. Auto detects Eve’s plant light. Goes still... Begins computing rapidly. The number “A113” flashes on his lens. An ELECTRONIC EXCHANGE begins between Auto and Gopher. Wally watches the interchange. Nervous. Without warning, Auto heads in his direction. Wally boxes up. A CIRCULAR SECTION OF FLOOR lights directly below him. Irises open, like a trapdoor. Wally drops...
30) 2) dialog: -- All hands on deck!! Wally is frantic to turn off the music as... ...PREP ROBOTS burst from the cabinetry... a BEAUTICIAN-BOT, MASSAGE-BOT and WARDROBE-BOT... The Captain’s bed automatically raises... ...Forms into a hover chair... The robots rapidly massage, brush, primp and dress him.

30) 8) dialog: Coffee. Wally hides under the console just in time. The Captain reaches for his coffee. Makes a minimal effort. Easier to adjust his chairback slowly forward... .-.--almost there...and...he grabs the coffee. 35.
30) 10) dialog: Protocol, Auto. First things first. (to the room) Computer, status report. His chair automatically arcs along the console. SPECIFIC PANELS light up as he passes.

As always, weather’s a balmy 72 degrees and sunny, and -- Oh, hey, I see the ship’s log is showing that today is our 700th anniversary of our five year cruise. Well, I’m sure our forefathers would be proud to know that 700 years later we'd be... (deflates) ..-doing the exact same thing...they were doing... Cut to VARIOUS ASPECTS OF AXIOM LIVING.

30) 24) dialog: Positive? Auto re-activates Eve. She wakes. Rises to salute the Captain. Across the room, Wally watches with sheer joy. She’s okay! He is compelled to head straight for her...
30) 25) dialog: But...no probe’s ever come back positive... (looks at flashing button) ..-before. The flashing button is practically calling to him. Can’t resist. Presses it. Instantly SHADES close on all the windows. The room goes dark. ...Wally is forced to hide under the console again... A LARGE HOLO-SCREEN appears right above him. Pre-recorded footage of the BNL CEO plays:
30) 28) dialog: (nervous ) Home? W-w-we'’re going back?
30) 32) dialog: Huh? Huh? Wally notices he has a clear shot to Eve. Heads in her direction.
30) 34) dialog: We have a jogging track?
30) 36) dialog: (reads; to himself) Operate... Manuel... (aloud; cautious) Manuel, relay instructions. Manuel? Auto intervenes. Clips the corner of the cover with his handle... ...and simply opens the book. The Captain is both fascinated and intimidated. Lifts the cover with his own fingers.
30) 37) dialog: Wow... Will you look at that?
30) 43) dialog: He manages to turn to the FIRST PAGE OF INSTRUCTIONS.
30) 44) dialog: (reads aloud) Well, let’s open her up. Step One. Voice command, “Confirm Acquisition.”

30) 49) dialog: Where’s the thingie?
30) 51) dialog: Plant. Right. Right. Where is it? (checks manual) Maybe we missed a step. Show me how you change the text again... 4l. Auto and the Captain turn away. Re-read the manual. Eve is stunned. Searches her chest cavity for the plant. Then she remembers...
30) 55) dialog: Why don’t you scan her to be sure. Eve jumps back to attention. Auto slides up to her. Scans her chest cavity.
30) 57) dialog: So, then...we’re NOT going to Earth?
30) 59) dialog: So, uh, I guess things go back to normal, huh?
30) 61) dialog: (privately relieved) Well, false alarm! 42.
30) 63) dialog: The probe must be defective. Gopher, send her to the Repair Ward. Eve turns. Excuse me? Gopher hops to attention. Traps Eve in his SUSPENSION BEAM. Loads her back onto the transport...
30) 64) dialog: Have them run diagnostics on her. Make sure she’s not malfunctioning -- EEYAH!! ...and reveals WALLY. Everyone stares at him. Long awkward pause. Wally innocently motors over to the Captain. Shakes his hand.
30) 66) dialog: Have “Wally” cleaned.
31) 3) dialog: Analyze. The CLUMP OF DIRT is suspended in a beam of light. It rotates. The captain sits at his vanity console. ANALYSIS DATA scrolls on a HOLO-SCREEN.
31) 5) dialog: Earth? His eyes drift to a GLOBE on his shelf.
31) 6) dialog: Define “Earth”...
31) 8) dialog: Wow... Define “sea”.
41) 2) dialog: Define “hoe-down”.
42) 0) text: The Captain is still engrossed in his Earth research. MULTIPLE IMAGES litter the screen. Crops, farms, a barn, etc.... An IMAGE OF PEOPLE SQUARE DANCING pops up.
42) 2) dialog: Auto! Earth is amazing! (points to images) These are called “farms”. Humans would put seeds in the ground, pour water on them, and they’d grow food, like, pizza -- Auto shuts off the holo-screen.
42) 4) dialog: (annoyed grunt) Auto rises back up to the bridge. The aperture shuts. Lights out. The Captain glares at the ceiling. Then whispers conspiratorially to the computer.
42) 5) dialog: Psst! Computer. (the holo-screen lights up) Define “dancing”.
43) 14) dialog: [Rocket noises] Prepare for landing... [Landing noises] We’re here everybody! Yeah, Captain! [crowd cheers] Captain we're home! It’s so beautiful! [crowd cheers]...No it’s nothing. I was pleased to do it. It’s all about you people --
43) 16) dialog: (amazed) How...? How’d you find it?! Eve hovers over to him. Salutes. Formally presents him the plant. He takes it in his hands. Still potted in the old boot. Gazes at it in wonder.
43) 17) dialog: We can go back home...for the first time! (laughs) What’s it like now? Eve shrugs. Doesn’t know how to answer.
43) 18) dialog: No, no! Don’t tell me! I want to see for myself! He turns to his console. Hits a button. A CYLINDRICAL DEVICE rises from a panel. The Captain sticks it to the side of Eve’s head. A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN projects from the device. Plays back images of her time on Earth. A COLLAGE OF IMAGES rapidly scroll past. All displayed from Eve's POV: ...-Being delivered to Earth... Flying above the devastated landscape... Blowing up a rock... -..Scans of numerous trash locations...
43) 21) dialog: Wait...that doesn’t look like Earth... Where’s the blue sky... He looks over to his computer screen. The BEAUTY IMAGES OF EARTH still on display. Compares them with what plays on Eve's screen.
43) 22) dialog: ...Where’s the grass? His face drops. Slumps in defeat. The dream is over. ON EVE’S HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN The HELLO DOLLY clip of POYSC plays... It stirs the Captain out of his funk. He looks up at the screen. Leans in for a closer look.
43) 23) dialog: .-.-I know that song... (observes the dancers’ feet) And they're... dancing. Yes, dancing! A rueful smile grows on his face. He looks down at

43) 26) dialog: (Gasp!) Oh no, no -- (remembers ) Wait a minute. The Captain urgently hovers across the room. Eve left alone. Her recorded memories continue playing... ..-The clip changes to It Only Takes a Moment. 63. Eve recognizes the music. Watches the lovers on screen hold hands. Something familiar about the gesture... Looks at her own hands. Slowly, she interlocks her fingers... ...Eve’s eyes go wide. This is what Wally was trying to say to her. Her memories continue on the screen: -.-a tap on the shoulder... Wally presents her the plant -- .-.-The screen goes BLACK!
43) 37) dialog: There you go little guy. You came a long way for a drink of water... Just needed someone to look after you, that’s all -- He is struck with a notion. Stares out the window at space for a beat. Sees HIS REFLECTION holding the plant. Glances at his EARTH GLOBE.
43) 38) dialog: (to himself) We have to go back. Activates his chair’s call button.
43) 39) dialog: Auto, come down here!
43) 46) dialog: Auto, Eve found the plant. Fire up the Holo-detector.
43) 48) dialog: (not listening) You know what? I should do it myself. Heads for the elevator.
43) 51) dialog: Auto, get out of my way.
43) 53) dialog: What are you talking about? Why not?
43) 55) dialog: (holds plant out of reach) What do you mean, “classified”? You don’t keep secrets from the Captain! 66.
43) 57) dialog: Tell me what’s classified!
43) 59) dialog: Tell me, Auto! That’s an order! It’s a stare down. Beat.
43) 62) dialog: Unsustainable? What?
43) 64) dialog: (offended) Easier? 67.
43) 68) dialog: No, wait a minute. Computer, when was that message sent to the Axiom? The paused image on the holo-screen highlights. Data begins to calculate on the screen. We see YEARS SCROLL RAPIDLY BACKWARDS. It stops on “2110”.
43) 70) dialog: That’s -- that’s nearly 700 years ago!! Auto, things have changed! We've got to go back!
43) 72) dialog: But life is sustainable now! Look at this plant, green and growing! It’s living proof he was wrong.
43) 77) dialog: I DON’T WANT TO SURVIVE! I WANT TO LIVE!
43) 79) dialog: 
43) 81) dialog: I'm the Captain of the Axiom. We are going home today! Auto slides into his face. Makes the Captain flinch. No more Mr. Nice Robot. Auto emits an ELECTRONIC COMMAND.
43) 83) dialog: Gopher? Gopher activates his suspension beam. Bay. 69. Snatches the plant away from the Captain.
43) 84) dialog: Hey! That's my plant. This is mutiny! (to Eve) Eve, arrest him! Eve draws her GUN ARM. Points it at Gopher. The robot raises his epaulet arms. Don’t shoot! She opens her chest cavity. Motions for Gopher to put the plant inside her.
43) 85) dialog: Eve, you are to put this plant straight in the Holo-detector. Gopher slowly advances towards Eve. But then tosses the plant across the room... ...-down the TRASH CHUTE.
43) 86) dialog: No!
43) 90) dialog: 
43) 93) dialog: Wally! The plant!...[Toss it! Over here! ] Wally is slow to understand. Finally picks up the plant. Anticipates to throw it, when... ..-Auto lowers right in front of him, trying to block.
43) 99) text: The Captain looks up. Shakes his fist in fury.
43) 100) dialog: 
46) 6) dialog: (hoarse; exhausted) Mutinyyy...Mute...neee...This is your last chance...Auto...You hear me?...Stupid...wheel...
46) 8) dialog: The plant! The Captain’s eyes light up. Glances down at the OPEN MANUAL on the floor. “Plant icon + Holo-detector icon = Earth” He is filled with renewed determination.
46) 9) dialog: Laughs) We’ll see who’s powerless now. g: Pp Lays flat in his chair. Floats under his VANITY CONSOLE like a grease monkey. Pulls off the underside panel.
46) 10) dialog: Ah-Ha! Yanks out a bundle of wiring. Cross-connects two wires. The console powers up... 79.
47) 0) text: Eve zooms through the hallways. A BAND OF REJECTS track behind them. They reach an intersection when... .-..The CAPTAIN’S FACE appears on holo-screens all around them.
47) 1) dialog: Testing, testing... Is this thing on?
48) 0) text: Auto watches the Captain on the holo-screen. Furiously tries to shut off the intercom.
48) 2) dialog: Psssst! Hey! Hey! This is the Captain I'm locked in my room. Eve, Wally, bring the plant to the Lido Deck. I'll have activated the holo-detector. Now hurry! Auto's probably going to cut me off -- The screens all go dead. Eve and Wally look at each other with determination. They're about to continue on when... A WALL OF STEWARDS block their path.
48) 7) dialog: Ha, ha! Look what I got, Auto! Auto’s single lens irises wide.
48) 9) dialog: That’s right! The plant! Oh, you want it? Come and get it, Blinky!
48) 11) dialog: Ha ha! HEARS AUTO coming. Turns off the vid-com. 81. Yanks his bundle of wires out of the wall. The room goes dark again.
48) 14) text: The Captain lunges at him. Grabs Auto by the steering wheel. Hangs onto it like Cap’n Ahab in a gale. His lower extremities of no use.
48) 16) dialog: What too heavy for ya, huh?!
48) 18) dialog: You're not getting away from me, one-eye! -- OOF! -- Is that all you got?! Gopher drops out of his pneumatic tube. Sees the Captain fighting Auto. Charges at the Captain... ...who kicks him straight out the window...
48) 23) dialog: That’s it!...A little closer! Must..press...button. The Captain reaches his one free hand out for... ...the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON.
48) 24) dialog: Gotcha! Ha ha! His hand slams down hard on it. KLAXONS sound all over the ship.
49) 4) dialog: (strained; in command) Ladies and Gentlemen! This is your Captain speaking! We’re having a slight malfunction with the Autopilot! Please remain calm! The passengers get caught up in the conflict. Treat it as if it were a televised fight.
49) 20) dialog: Nol!
49) 25) dialog: Auto! Auto whips around. Shocked to see the Captain standing (albeit wobbly). Finds himself face to face with him. Auto flips out his TASER. Rushes at him. The Captain grabs it. They wrestle. The taser ARCS in the Captain’s face. He flinches. Looks up. Sees a CONTROL PANEL high up on Auto’s column... -..and smirks. The Captain looks Auto in the eye. Raises a finger up to the control panel... -..to the “AUTOPILOT” BUTTON... -..and flicks the switch to “MANUAL”.
