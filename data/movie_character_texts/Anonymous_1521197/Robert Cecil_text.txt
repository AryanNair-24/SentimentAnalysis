19) 8) text: (smiles) With your father in London dealing with all the troubles in Ireland, who else should the Queen turn to but Essex? Robert Cecil looks annoyed, but holds his tongue as the SOUND of pikes HITTING the floor silences the hall. A FOOTMAN clears his throat and-- FOOTMAN
19) 13) text: Yes, your grace, though not from me. Southampton CLAPS his hands and a door across the room OPENS. A DWARF enters, followed by dancing faires, actors swirling sparklers, and musicians playing music. Elizabeth's rheumy eyes widen in complete delight, a smile of total jubilation crosses her face.

27) 3) dialog: He is an Earl, father. I cannot deny him--

29) 0) text: And it is thirty years earlier. BOY ROBERT CECIL (now 9) is staring out of the window. His back must have been deformed either in utero or at birth, because even now he is hunchbacked. WILLIAM CECIL(O.S.)

66) 0) text: Robert Cecil is furious, pacing back and forth in front of William Cecil, who sits behind a large wooden desk. William Cecil is pale and sweaty-- he is deathly ill, and sits in a wooden chair with small spoked wheels attached to the legs-- sort of an Elizabethan wheelchair.

113) 5) text: Is it so hard to believe that once I was young? That I was... beautiful? Your father knew me as such... (beat) You have read the book? She doesn't have to say which one. Robert Cecil sees a copy of "Venus and Adonis" on a table. He NODS. ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
