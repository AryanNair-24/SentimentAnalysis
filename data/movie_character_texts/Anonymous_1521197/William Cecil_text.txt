16) 11) text: Think, Henry, if James owes Cecil his throne, Cecil will have more influence in the next reign than he does in this one. And after William Cecil, his hunch-backed son will take his place... (careful) That is why we must do everything in our power to ensure that the right man succeeds her. (beat) A man deserving of the Tudor crown. Southampton stiffens at that last phrase. ESSEX (CONT'D)

22) 21) text: Our Lord Cecil is our most religious of subjects, and no doubt thinks your little masque will deliver your soul straight into the arms of Lucifer himself. Don't you, William? The Boy Oxford looks at William Cecil, perplexed by such a thing.
22) 22) dialog: That is God's decision, your majesty. Not mine. William Cecil looks directly at John de Vere resulting in an uncomfortable silence. Elizabeth notices.
25) 7) text: Lord William Cecil. I have the questionable distinction of being married to his only daughter. Oxford looks over to his wife who watches them suspiciously. He begins to walk away forcing Jonson and Francesco to follow. OXFORD (CONT'D)

27) 1) dialog: So! I am gone for three days, and you somehow manage to let her spend all of them solely in the company of the Earl of Essex... Robert Cecil looks at him sharply.   How did he know.
27) 2) dialog: Don't think because I was in London, I didn't know exactly what went on here in my absence.
27) 4) dialog: Of course not! You don't deny him anything. You find excuses. She is unwell, she is reading, she is seeing the Ambassador from Russia. For God's sake, use your imagination, Robert. Whatever will you do when I am gone? (beat)

29) 7) text: Why? WILLIAM CECIL
29) 8) text: Because the Queen has bade it so. (to Young Oxford) My lord, when we first met, you said you wished to become a great man of State. Both the Queen and I hope to make that so. (MORE) WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)

29) 17) text: Then cosmography with Doctor Richards. Two to three is geography and history, and four to five fencing. William Cecil seems to have finished.
29) 20) dialog: This is a Puritan home, your grace. We believe such activities to be the worship of false idols, and therefore a sin before the eyes of God.

36) 8) text: Essex?  To Ireland? (frowns) For how long? WILLIAM CECIL
36) 10) text: Impossible. He cannot be spared. We feel his counsel is of greater import with each passing day. Not what William Cecil wanted to hear. WILLIAM CECIL
36) 12) text: Philip of Spain dreams still of taking your kingdom from you. (MORE) WILLIAM CECIL (CONT'D)
36) 14) text: But Essex? WILLIAM CECIL

37) 9) dialog: You have placed me in a grave position, Edward.
37) 11) dialog: I cannot have my reputation soiled by this regrettable lack of control on your part... No. I will not have it. We can claim self-defense, he drew sword first. (beat)
37) 13) dialog: My daughter is young, impressionable. She has feelings for you, Edward. It is to be expected, living in such close quarters...
37) 15) dialog: Hold your tongue, Edward, before you make a claim you cannot retract! I have been legally reimbursed for your education and living expenses.
37) 17) dialog: No. This is how I suggest you keep your noble head from the executioner's block.
38) 2) dialog: appears triumphant.   He looks beaming over to...

65) 3) text: William Cecil was murdered?
66) 0) text: Robert Cecil is furious, pacing back and forth in front of William Cecil, who sits behind a large wooden desk. William Cecil is pale and sweaty-- he is deathly ill, and sits in a wooden chair with small spoked wheels attached to the legs-- sort of an Elizabethan wheelchair.
66) 2) dialog: No, Robert, think. If he is really as popular as you say, we would only anger the mob. No. We must strike at Edward directly. William Cecil slowly-- and shakily-- bends down from his chair as--

68) 4) dialog: You will write to James that I am gravely ill, but that all is in hand. Much of the Privy Council has already secretly agreed to his ascension to the English throne due to your tireless, but secret, entreaties on his behalf. (beat)
68) 6) dialog: This is how kings are made, Robert. So it was with Elizabeth, and so it shall ever be. There were many rival claims to her throne, but none survived to make their claim. James must know that you will do the same for him, and he will reward you for it. (beat)
68) 7) text: But we must do one thing more... William Cecil has a coughing fit-- reaches for a glass vial of medicine at his bedside-- takes it.

70) 5) dialog: She's on Progress. With this he leaves the chapel.
71) 3) dialog: The Queen does not ask for my advice about matters of the heart, Edward. If she had, she hardly would have chosen you for her pleasure. He has a point.
71) 4) dialog: You must have known her eye would move elsewhere, Edward. It always has. You are neither the first, nor the last, of her lovers. Young Oxford looks up at him like a bucket of cold water has hit him. William Cecil stops. He looks at Oxford with a stern face.
71) 5) dialog: Go back to my daughter, Edward. She will accept you with open arms, as she always has. Behave as your great title demands you behave. Tend to your estates, your investments. (a beat)
72) 3) text: Why do you think Will hasn't been arrested? You or I make the slightest joke about a nobleman of no consequence, and we find ourselves in a cell quicker than a fart spreads in the trade winds.

89) 1) dialog: I cannot be certain, majesty, when the... relationship began.
90) 0) text: Young Elizabeth looks out a window, obviously distressed. William Cecil is across from her, his face tense.
90) 1) dialog: But sometime soon after your return to Court.

You will make some effort to make her happy and you will finally act according to your station in life, and accept the responsibilities of your great title. Oxford reluctantly NODS.    William Cecil goes to leave. YOUNG OXFORD
92) 5) text: My lord!     I, too, have a condition. William Cecil turns. YOUNG OXFORD (CONT'D)
92) 6) text: I will go back to your daughter if... You tell me the name of the child. WILLIAM CECIL
92) 8) text: No.   The other one. Cecil's face goes to stone. WILLIAM CECIL
92) 12) dialog: There is no record of his true birth, no trail that leads to you, or the... mother. His foster parents never knew the truth, and both are now dead...
92) 14) dialog: Make even a hint of this to the child, or anyone else, and this agreement is void, and I'll see your head on the block within a fortnight. And the boy's as well.
