0) 0) text: It's a summer day. The heat floats above the pavement. A cab waits in the lot. The large gates of New York's largest prison open and tod group of newly released emerge. They pass a guard who lifts up a copy of The USA Today to reveal the headlines and date that tells us it's 2002. Amongst this group we find a man carrying a small duffel. And we know this man. He is Gordon Gekko. But he is not as slick as we remember... he doesn't have gleam in his eyes or that gel in his hair. No, this is a very different version of the man we remember... because there's nothing behind those eyes... nothing we can read anyway. And he just stands there... coldly watching his recently freed brethren greet their wives and children... reunitin with the people who waited for them... the people who lov them. The cab slowly pulls up and Gordon holds up a finger... w a minute. He glares over to the entrance of the lot... waiting for his people... but they don't come. And the cab waits... Gordon stands there... in the heat.. completely disappointed... and completely alone. And we...
16) 6) dialog: No swagger in his step... not in a suit... hair not slick back... but still looks fucking good. As he waits for the applause to wind down... and even a little longer... surveying every corner of the large room commanding its full attention... getting it... holding th silence... until finally... he leans into the mic and say 19.
16) 9) dialog: You're all pretty much fucked. The room breaks into laughter... Gordon smiles and waits it to die down.
17) 1) dialog: (announcing to the throng) I'll give you six minutes then I really have to go.
18) 2) dialog: You're too late, Sport... Q&amp;A's over.
18) 7) dialog: I'll give you nine minutes.
19) 1) dialog: Keller, Zabel? Then you have my apologies.
19) 3) dialog: Stock's in a free fall. My guess is that it just lost its Bar Mitzvah... Jacob quickly takes out his blackberry, turns it on and checks to see Gordon's right... KZI... $12.54.
19) 7) dialog: Andrew's smart, he beats the benchmarks consistently. He'll land on his feet.
19) 10) dialog: I'm sorry to hear that.
19) 16) dialog: My daughter hasn't spoken to me for eleven years and you know it. She blames me for her brother's overdose and every other disaster that's fallen upon the world since the mid-nineties.
19) 19) dialog: She hates me. And she hates Wall Street and everything it represents... so don't you find it curious that she would fall in love with you? And that slams into Jacob... who's frozen for a beat. Jacob finally snaps out of it then joins Gordon.
19) 22) dialog: I guess I should know a little about you first. Where did you grow up?
19) 24) dialog: I'm impressed.
19) 28) dialog: And your father... what did he do?
19) 30) dialog: Clever. Jacob looks down the street.
19) 33) dialog: Well, pal... As Gordon pats Jacob on the back...
20) 3) dialog: She was eight in that one. It was taken in Egypt.
20) 8) dialog: What do I get in return?
20) 10) dialog: Yes. I'll give you this picture and in return... I'd like a picture of Winnie... taken recently... without you in it.
20) 12) dialog: Then I'll give you this one on margin.
20) 15) dialog: No, you didn't. Nice ring... As the train arrives...
21) 1) dialog: Don't play me, Jake. You don't think I can see it in your eyes? You don't think I know that look?
21) 8) dialog: Revenge. Jacob just looks away.
21) 12) dialog: Like I said -- I still love to watch from home. And now Gordon turns to face Jacob with...
21) 15) dialog: Really?
21) 19) dialog: Does Winnie even know you came to see me?
21) 22) dialog: Not such a grand idea, Pal. Off Jacob's confusion...
21) 28) dialog: It's not worth it. It's a waste of energy and time. See, Jacob, nobody gets it... they never did. As the subway doors open...
44) 0) text: Jacob heads up to the restaurant to find Gordon Gekko wai outside.
44) 1) dialog: There's a wait.
44) 3) dialog: Fifteen minutes she said.
44) 5) dialog: No, that's not okay. Because it means they're crowded so every tier in the service chain will be extended. The sixteen minutes we would normally wait to order will now be twenty six, the standard twenty four minutes waiting for our food to arrive will turn into thirty nine, the eight minutes to get the check will become seventeen and the four minutes to process the credit card will take nine.
45) 1) dialog: Did you eat before?
45) 3) dialog: Yeah... I used to not eat lunch too. Jacob nods and slides something across the table. The picture of Winnie in workout gear, flipping the finger. Gordon looks at it and laughs. 46.
45) 10) dialog: Did you?
45) 12) dialog: Well, Chief... you seem awfully proud of yourself.
45) 14) dialog: It's amazing what information you can find out when people know you're not going to trade on it.
45) 16) dialog: Naw. I prefer to write about the action now than be apart of it.
45) 18) dialog: You're out of a job and most likely going to marry my daughter... I figured you could use the money.
45) 22) dialog: You didn't trade it? With a smile in and over-the-top faux innocence.
46) 1) dialog: So did you take my advice and not tell your new fiance about our little friendship. Jacob doesn't say anything. And Gordon doesn't press.
46) 4) dialog: That's my Winnie. I knew she was a feminist when she was five and furious that Mrs. Claus didn't get enough credit. And this makes Jacob smile... then...
47) 3) dialog: You know it.
48) 1) dialog: She refused to take that cowboy hat off. She actually slept in it. Smitten, Jacob looks at some more of the pictures then stands... taking in the large framed pictures on the wall As Jacob checks out a framed chart for "Gouda Tulip Bulbs 1 1634 to Feb 5 1637." The chart goes straight up and to right then straight down in a single line. 49.
48) 6) dialog: And did you accept? As Jacob moves over to an another piece.
48) 8) dialog: JP Morgan... he single-handedly stopped the Panic of 1907 by stepping in and buying up shares in all the companies that were crashing. Everyone else quickly followed like lemmings. (re political cartoon) See -- people had stopped looking to their government or trusted advisors. They looked to JP Morgan. It was all about simple psychology -- every crash should have a JP Morgan to step in and save it. As they walk the hardwood floor...
48) 16) dialog: I know. As they both hold on the picture...
48) 18) dialog: A country in debt... that took on even more debt to fund a war... then printed mountains of money to avoid a depression and other financial imbalances... As he turns to face Jacob...
48) 21) dialog: If we don't take our heads out of the sand... yes. It's going to get bad out there, Champ, I'm not going to lie. Even the small regional bank I started out at might go under.
48) 23) dialog: That's right. And then...
48) 28) dialog: What I'm talking about, Jake... is that I'd bet dollars to donuts that Bretton Woods unwound most of his position in Amlyn last week. That he knew about the pancreatitis. Off of Jacob's confusion...
48) 31) dialog: I don't. But it's not Bretton's first rodeo... and my instincts for this sort of thing don't often disappoint. Jacob can't believe it. And with each passing moment of realization... shock turns into rage.
48) 33) dialog: Believe it, Princess... he's beating your ass all over the court. As Jacob tries to calm himself.
48) 35) dialog: I don't know, Jake... what you kids think is pay-back these days is really incredible. When I was coming up, we slaughtered men.
58) 1) dialog: Good work, kid -- you're on the inside now.
58) 3) dialog: No.
58) 5) dialog: He's not meeting you in New York.
58) 7) dialog: Because you need to go to Dubai with him.
72) 2) dialog: Well, I'm happy to help.
72) 6) dialog: 
72) 11) dialog: So you're a hedge fund cowboy now? Shaking his head...
72) 36) dialog: As for your end of our trade.
72) 39) dialog: Absolutely. Jacob just shakes his head with a laugh... now realizing Gekko talked him into this position for this exact levera
72) 43) dialog: Just be happy I'm on your team.
72) 46) dialog: What have I been saying all along, Kid?
72) 48) dialog: They're a death trap -- mark my words.
82) 1) dialog: Hi. Fighting back the nerves...
82) 4) dialog: Yes. They all sit.
82) 7) dialog: Oh... okay. Then Gordon attempts a smile over to his daughter.
82) 14) dialog: I've been following your career, Winnie. Senator Lehigh said some very nice things about you in The American Prospect interview.
82) 18) dialog: It's okay. This is a long term investment.
85) 1) dialog: Tripling the size... that's a very aggressive move. Jacob nods.
85) 5) dialog: I've heard of it. Letting out a little laugh...
85) 8) dialog: Can you give me the cover? Tom isn't sure if Gordon's serious. Either is Jacob. 85.
85) 12) dialog: Get me the cover and I'll give you seventy minutes. Tom politely smiles.
85) 14) dialog: (almost to himself) Both those assholes got the cover when they were convicted. And after a moment...
85) 16) dialog: It's all going down. ... and takes a bite.
86) 10) dialog: Isn't that what you always say, Bretton? Then... announcing to the table...
86) 13) dialog: That's right.
86) 22) dialog: Just cause it's low don't make it cheap, Sport.
86) 24) dialog: It's not out yet.
86) 28) dialog: Since I have forty-four seconds to spare, I'm going to tell you a story. It's about a guy named Sam. And we go close on Gekko...
91) 2) dialog: Okay... 98.
91) 6) dialog: I don't know what to tell you, Pal. You wanted to make him bleed, I wanted my daughter back... As he walks...
91) 9) dialog: Look at you. This can't possibly be the man my daughter fell in love with. Jacob turns away.
91) 11) dialog: Why?
91) 13) dialog: The universe is an efficient market, Kid... we all get what we deserve.
91) 15) dialog: I know you cared about him... and I know how that motivates. But Jacob... he wasn't such a Saint. 99.
91) 19) dialog: You don't want to know. Jacob steps forward... shouting out after him...
91) 21) dialog: Okay Jake... you want to know. Jacob sharply nods.
91) 25) dialog: He would get people to invest with him by offering larger than normal returns then pay the old investors with the new investors money. As long as there was fresh money, he could keep going. Do you know what his name was, Jacob? It was Charles...
91) 38) dialog: I'm not, Son. I wish I were. Jacob just stands there... stunned with what he's hearing
100) 3) dialog: Short version -- taking risks you're not accountable for with other people's money. And the next person steps up and hands Gordon a copy.
100) 5) dialog: There you go.
100) 7) dialog: I'm a writer now. We don't make that much. As the line of people holding their new books start to ge impatient...
100) 11) dialog: Well, if you need money that badly, Jake... you might want to check closer to home. Off Jacob's confused reaction...
101) 28) dialog: You also would need the trust's executor to sign it. INTERCUT WITH... Jacob as he walks down 5th avenue...
101) 30) dialog: Sammy Redding. He's a lifelong friend. It won't be a problem.
101) 32) dialog: I would love to sign it, Jacob. Consider it done. Walking down 5th avenue...
101) 34) dialog: Just after you agree to two things.
101) 36) dialog: Before Bretton buys the bank, he must use all of Winnie's money and all the Locust Fund's leverage to go against the market. They're about to pass this bailout and I want to be on the other side of it.
101) 39) dialog: It's just for a few weeks then it's right back to our plan. 108.
101) 45) dialog: Winnie... come here... you're all I have left now. And she slowly walks over to him... to his embrace...
114) 32) dialog: Did you see Barrons?
114) 35) dialog: The powers that be will never let that happen. Jacob's not arguing it...
114) 37) dialog: I've been asked that before...
114) 44) dialog: I'll always have America... it's why I'm here. I'm buying the island.
114) 48) dialog: It still trades... And he turns to Jacob with a smile...
114) 51) dialog: I don't know why. You pulled it off, Kid, you took him down -- granted with my help -- but you atoned for Zabel's sins with Bretton's money.
114) 54) dialog: (of course I did) I'm human. 121.
114) 58) dialog: Same answer.
114) 60) dialog: I've been trying to wire two hundred million into her bank account but she won't accept it.
114) 63) dialog: That sounds good. I bet you can even wrap it in a pretty red bow. But Champ, it's idealistic... and idealism kills every trade.
114) 71) dialog: What do you want?
114) 73) dialog: You want me to buy? And Jacob Moore... slowly confirming...
114) 77) dialog: We're far from the bottom. It'll be a dead cat bounce.
114) 80) dialog: What do I get in return? 123.
114) 84) dialog: You can offer that?
114) 86) dialog: What else?
114) 88) dialog: Sorry son -- that's simply a trade I cannot make. And as Gordon Gekko walks off... leaving Jacob Moore behind...
