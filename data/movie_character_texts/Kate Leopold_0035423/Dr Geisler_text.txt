118) 1) dialog: The time tables have been set. Just  strap yourself in and you'll be fine.
118) 2) dialog: You have only a twenty four hour  leeway before the machine is set to  return to us. You must find Carlson  within that time frame and get her  on board or there will be little  chance of her finding a way back.
