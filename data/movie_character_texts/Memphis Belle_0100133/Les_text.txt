It is an epic sight, showing the huge scale of the air war and the number of men required to sustain it. In the f.g. is a plane, "Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby?" The pilot's window is shattered, a front tire is flat, a chunk has been taken out of the tail, the ball turret is broken in half and what remains is covered in dried blood. A mechanic is hosing it out. LES ENRIGHT, a stocky man in his mid- thirties, wearing grease-stained coveralls, is helping carry a new ball turret over to the plane. Dennis goes over to him.

15) 11) dialog: The Belle's in mint condition. If you don't believe me, go look at her. She's out on the apron, Sir. Les turns back to work. A moment. Dennis knows he jumped on Les a little too fast, but he also doesn't want to apologize. He turns and goes out the door.

Between the pilot and co-pilot seats is a pedestal with the ignition switches, engine controls and throttles. Below that, another box with switches and wheels controlling the trim tabs, elevators and rudders. Luke sits in the co-pilot seat. He plugs in his intercom and speaks.

Rascal compulsively shuffles a deck of cards. Clay is whittling again. Jack and Eugene sit against the right aft bulk- head.

The plane begins to move forward.

They're careful not to point their noses at or fly directly into the for- mation to avoid being mistaken for enemy aircraft. These one-seat fighters have a single propeller mounted in a round, blunt nose with a white ring around the cowling. They have eight machine gun barrels, four on each wing. They zoom effortlessly through the air at 300 m.p.h. and can perform dazzling acrobatics.
