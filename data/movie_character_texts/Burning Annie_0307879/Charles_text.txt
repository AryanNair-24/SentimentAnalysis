18) 6) dialog: Max, you're insane.
18) 10) dialog: So you got a C minus! Don't you think you're getting carried away?
18) 14) dialog: Your paranoia has always been out of control, but this is absurd.
18) 18) dialog: Neither are you!
18) 22) dialog: And wasn't that the paper that you handed in two weeks late?
18) 26) dialog: Professor Wang? Will you stop it...
19) 3) dialog: So what do you want to do tonight?
19) 7) dialog: Have you ever noticed that the more Annie Hall you watch, the less successful you are romantically? I think we'd do much better if we watched, say, Ocean's 11.
20) 3) dialog: No, I'm telling you, I was thinking about this over break. Ever since we started watching it, what has your love life been like? And mine? Every semester, we watch this movie, and then spend the semester alone.
20) 7) dialog: You know actresses don't count.
20) 14) dialog: I'm just kidding around, Max. We'll watch it tomorrow. Tonight, there's a party.
20) 18) dialog: Sam hasn't seen Annie Hall since freshman year, and he's in his third year with Jen.
20) 22) dialog: Ouch. Why are you still on this? I said I was kidding.
22) 8) dialog: Max, you're coming and that's the end of it. When's the last time you went to a party?
22) 12) dialog: I'm not taking no. With Sam on board, it's gonna be like old times.
22) 45) dialog: Yeah, what are you doing tonight?
22) 49) dialog: Great, so come party with me.
23) 8) dialog: This is it, I'm telling you. This is the semester I pass all my classes and meet the dame of my dreams.
23) 12) dialog: More importantly, may she grant us our occasional freedom.
23) 16) dialog: He's become a total non-entity. Freshman year, we were like Frank and Deano. Now it's like Frank and freakin' Peter Lawford.
23) 20) dialog: Hottie at 3 o'clock. Keep an eye on her for me so it doesn't look like I'm interested.
23) 24) dialog: Look, all I said was, it would explain our lives.
23) 28) dialog: So? Everybody knows that. 20.
23) 37) dialog: I can't believe it.
23) 41) dialog: How'd you get away?
23) 47) dialog: I can get into this. It's better than those frat parties. Check out the fox in the beret.
23) 51) dialog: You could always change your major. You'd have a lot more free time.
23) 61) dialog: Would you do it?
23) 74) dialog: Oh, shit, Sara's here.
23) 99) dialog: Ugh, no.
23) 103) dialog: Uh, yeah, we should be back in, uh, many many hours.
23) 114) dialog: Shit, I was hoping to avoid her for at least a few more days.
23) 118) dialog: First, she makes my skin crawl. Second, if word gets out, it'll ruin my reputation in the freshman dorms.
23) 123) dialog: I am a world-class knucklehead.
23) 128) dialog: One of us is Max.
23) 133) dialog: Thanks.
23) 146) dialog: Charles. I'm an actor.
23) 158) dialog: I work in theater a lot.
23) 166) dialog: I also direct.
23) 202) dialog: Check it. Jen traded shifts and got out of work, so she went to the lab to surprise Sam. He wasn't there, and then Tommy gave away that he was here.
23) 206) dialog: And how. Let's bail before the beheadings begin. Plus, The Rat Pack's on HBO later.
23) 211) dialog: I told you, it's research. It's why I got three phone numbers, Max, while you were talking to that cutie.
24) 4) dialog: That's right. You get her name?
24) 8) dialog: Man, you're worse at picking up chicks than me. We are one sad couple of bozos.
26) 3) dialog: Ow! Shit! Ow!
26) 6) dialog: Jeeezzus! Shit, sorry you um...
26) 10) dialog: It's just that, I mean, I'm just surprised to see you here.
26) 17) dialog: Bye. 28.
26) 24) dialog: She's around all the time! I chose to live with my hombres, not her. She's got to realize that we're not right for each other and get on with her life.
26) 28) dialog: Oh, what? I just stubbed my toe.
26) 32) dialog: The toe's the least of it.
26) 36) dialog: I know. It's a shame. And I was attracted to her once, too. What happened?
26) 40) dialog: No! I think I've heard enough from the Nostradamus of failed relationships to last a lifetime.
26) 44) dialog: I said I was joking, so why do you keep bringing it up? 29.
26) 50) dialog: Your attitude's too dour. You've gotta be more fun.
26) 54) dialog: You're just a wuss. The very thought of not seeing that movie scares you. You're like a junkie, you need movie methadone. Like, from now on you can only see Manhattan.
26) 58) dialog: You think addicts like Methadone?
26) 62) dialog: So what are we doing for lunch?
26) 70) dialog: Beth? Wow. She hasn't been around in ages. Say hi for me.
28) 14) dialog: It never changes, that's why.
28) 31) dialog: Even other people's.
28) 39) dialog: If it really bothers you, why don't you and Beth switch?
28) 51) dialog: Don't give in, Beth. I've got your back.
30) 4) dialog: Come on, which of you cats is in?
30) 10) dialog: Shit, it's only Monday? Now I really need a drink.
30) 22) dialog: Ouch.
30) 59) dialog: Using Ani DiFranco to get laid. I've gotta try that.
30) 82) dialog: But they're going as friends.
30) 91) dialog: How does "sex life" enter, if she might not be going, and if she does, it's just as friends?
30) 95) dialog: Yes. No.
36) 3) dialog: I was talking to Amanda the other day.
36) 15) dialog: Ouch.
36) 19) dialog: Ouch.
36) 23) dialog: Okay, ouch for real this time.
36) 29) dialog: That dame from History class? 45.
36) 37) dialog: Ohhh, that's the one from the party.
36) 41) dialog: Get her name yet?
36) 45) dialog: Uh-oh. This is bad.
36) 49) dialog: You're thinking about her. You're already making yourself nervous and you barely know her. You do this every time!
36) 53) dialog: See, this is what I'm talking about. If you don't go hit on her, I will.
36) 64) dialog: You have no choice. If you back away now, she'll never get to see the rest of your annoying personality traits.
56) 3) dialog: Fuckin' hate this flavored shit. Anyway, I can't believe the cat in the shag jacket was Andy.
56) 7) dialog: When I knew him as a freshman, he was pre- law... Whew. Anyway, it sounds like things are going well between you and Julie.
56) 11) dialog: I was wondering about that. You seem different lately.
56) 15) dialog: Like how you spent your whole sophomore year watching that lobster scene on repeat?
56) 19) dialog: You know, I actually regret mentioning that theory. In fact, Sam and I were thinking of watching it tonight. You in?
56) 23) dialog: Come on. Watching it without you would be weird. Unnatural. That film is you, Max, face it. 69.
56) 30) dialog: Listen, Max. I have to tell you something. I scored last night.
56) 34) dialog: With Beth.
56) 39) dialog: It wasn't premeditated.
56) 44) dialog: Look, nobody knows about it. It won't happen again.
56) 49) dialog: I'm sorry, Max. I wasn't sure if you'd care.
56) 53) dialog: What do you want me to say? I'm sorry, man. Let me pay for your coffee.
56) 60) dialog: Going back to the suite?
68) 6) dialog: Oh, is it the weekend already?
68) 10) dialog: Don't worry about it. Your troubles don't compare. Sara blew up at Stacy and nearly destroyed our first rehearsal.
68) 14) dialog: Uh-oh, here she comes.
69) 3) dialog: Studying for a test?
69) 7) dialog: Hey, I have a test on lighting next week that'll make your hair go grey.
69) 12) dialog: Thanks for bailing on me last night. I had to hear Sara gab for an hour.
69) 16) dialog: What do you mean?
69) 21) dialog: Holy shit.
69) 26) dialog: By the way, I saw Julie last night.
69) 30) dialog: Not if you count this huge purse she had. She was rummaging through it and finally had to dump the thing out. I swear, I'm surprised Kennedy's brain didn't fall out of that thing. Anyway, it made me think of Annie Hall.
69) 34) dialog: Although Julie dresses better.
69) 39) dialog: I didn't say that. 78.
69) 45) dialog: I didn't say that.
69) 49) dialog: Good Lord, Max. Take some harder classes.
69) 54) dialog: Great game.
71) 3) dialog: You've gotta be kidding.
71) 7) dialog: Can't I even meet her?
71) 14) dialog: What are you doing?
71) 19) dialog: Dude, Sam and I were gonna watch that.
86) 3) dialog: What's this, "Goldeneye"?
86) 8) dialog: Have you been here all day?
86) 12) dialog: Max, gotta tell you, you're really creeping me out.
86) 17) dialog: Still can't believe he broke up with Jen. I saw her yesterday and she looked sad.
86) 21) dialog: I asked her how she was doing, and she said "Fine," and asked me why I was asking.
86) 28) dialog: I was hanging with Sara. That girl pisses me off! She'll say the dumbest things, like, the Breeders are better than the Beatles.
86) 32) dialog: I wouldn't go that far. She's just a daffy dame, that's all. Now, Stacy's foxy, but she's too serious.
86) 36) dialog: What about her?
86) 43) dialog: Oh, man, I'm sorry. Was it you or her?
86) 52) dialog: 
86) 57) dialog: A no-show, huh?
86) 61) dialog: She invited all of us.
86) 69) dialog: Are you really wearing that tie?
86) 76) dialog: So take her. And pray Sara's not there.
89) 12) dialog: Something similar once happened to me, except I didn't know Nashville Pussy was a band.
89) 38) dialog: Dignity? You've been following me around like a lost dog since break, and you're talking about dignity?! You're always in my way, I can't get away from you!
89) 42) dialog: If they're making me sick, that's my business! Leave me alone already!
89) 80) dialog: Yes. No.
89) 110) dialog: I work in theater, so this is great training for me.
89) 127) dialog: This "bullshit" is going to put me in debt for the next forty years.
93) 30) dialog: Can't you have something that's not so serious?
93) 37) dialog: I think you're upset about not seeing some other parts of her again.
93) 40) dialog: She's a girl, Max. They'll always be a mystery. You'll never know why they love you and you'll never know why they don't.
93) 48) dialog: I finally dropped out of the play I was directing, just to get rid of Sara. God, my career is in shambles.
93) 60) dialog: Nah. I think I'm gonna call Sara...
