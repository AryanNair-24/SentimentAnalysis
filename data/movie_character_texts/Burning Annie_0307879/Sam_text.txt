7) 15) dialog: Are you comfortable, honey?
7) 21) dialog: Oh no, no, Jen, if you're happy, I'm happy.
8) 3) dialog: Wow, what a good movie.
22) 15) dialog: Yeah, I haven't been out with you guys in ages.
22) 20) dialog: Aw, honey, just for a little while.
22) 25) dialog: She has a point, guys. I should catch up on my chemistry reading anyway.
23) 35) dialog: Hey! I made it!
23) 43) dialog: I told her I was going to the lab. She doesn't mind if I'm working while she is. How's the party?
23) 49) dialog: Man, it's so good to be out. Between Jen, homework, and labs, I hardly have time for anything.
23) 53) dialog: I feel the same way about science that I do about Jen. It's a lot of work, but it's worth it.
23) 57) dialog: I have doubts about both, actually. But still, what could be dumber than changing your major for a girl?
23) 65) dialog: Of course not, when has studying ever interfered with what's important, like video hockey or your radio show that nobody listens to.
23) 69) dialog: And every time I see you doing homework, you're taking a break. You're the best I've ever seen when it comes to procrastinating.
23) 79) dialog: 
23) 89) dialog: Good.
23) 116) dialog: What do you have against her? She seems nice.
28) 16) dialog: 
28) 37) dialog: Max, what's up with you today? Join a support group.
28) 42) dialog: What about people at other tables? Should we ask the management to stop serving egg- products to people upwind of you?
30) 12) dialog: I'm in.
30) 52) dialog: Bye.
30) 61) dialog: She'll never give up on Scott.
30) 78) dialog: It's not even a date.
30) 84) dialog: They are friends.
30) 93) dialog: Wait, can you be on a date with someone you're not dating?
32) 6) dialog: Yeah. Wasn't there also a video hockey scene in Mallrats?
32) 10) dialog: Which one had all the comic book stuff?
32) 14) dialog: What about the Star Wars stuff?
32) 18) dialog: What about the last one?
32) 22) dialog: You gotta admit, it's fucking cheap for a movie to refer to other movies.
32) 26) dialog: Yeah. Our lives would make an awful movie. 41.
32) 32) dialog: So fucking what? It's a shitty movie!
32) 37) dialog: How come you only play this one video game?
32) 41) dialog: More like the loon.
32) 46) dialog: Yeah. Your prediction finally came true. Come on, let's hit the bar. I need a drink.
33) 5) dialog: We were just hanging out, and she told me she loves me. Completely out of the blue. She says things like that sometimes, things like "I love that you're my boyfriend," ya know? But usually when we're in bed or something. But this time it was different, all we were doing was watching TV.
33) 11) dialog: Almost. It was "our" show, the one we like to get romantic to...
34) 3) dialog: 
34) 9) dialog: Well, not completely... I don't know if I can explain it. See...
34) 16) dialog: When she comes back, she slaps me in the face and makes me leave. Then she calls, crying, and asks me to come over. When I go back, she kicks me out and says she never wants to see me again.
35) 2) dialog: Is it really so bad? I couldn't lie to her.
35) 6) dialog: Look, I fucked up, alright? I didn't know what to say.
35) 10) dialog: Me too. It'll be hard to get used to, but at least we ended it early.
35) 13) dialog: Hey, you know what I'm in the mood for? Annie Hall.
35) 17) dialog: Come on, Max, I can only deal with one mid-life crisis at a time.
35) 21) dialog: You think?
35) 25) dialog: Gee, at least I can hang out with my friends again. 44.
41) 6) dialog: I'll be right back.
42) 3) dialog: Jen called yesterday, while we were at the bar.
42) 9) dialog: Yeah. I went over there to talk again today. She's taking it hard.
42) 13) dialog: We're having dinner tonight. Wanna come?
42) 17) dialog: Yeah, we're definitely broken up. I guess sometimes it seems like we're sliding back into our old patterns.
42) 20) dialog: It's not what you think. I need a petroleum jelly for the polymers class I'm TA-ing.
42) 25) dialog: What-the-heck.
42) 28) dialog: I need a basket. Hold this.
42) 57) dialog: No baskets.
42) 61) dialog: What?
42) 65) dialog: Who's Julie?
43) 3) dialog: I'll be right back.
60) 5) dialog: Just that. Nothing more.
60) 9) dialog: Nothing. They were having lunch.
60) 13) dialog: You're over-reacting.
60) 17) dialog: You're not even dating!
60) 21) dialog: It was just lunch in the cafeteria. He looked completely normal.
69) 52) dialog: Look at you two. Wouldn't something else be fun for a change? How about Goldeneye?
69) 58) dialog: Lucky for you, I actually have time to teach you. Normally I would be having lunch with Jen.
69) 63) dialog: Man, he'll do anything to avoid change, won't he?
73) 35) dialog: Come on! What about touch? Missing the smell of rotting milk is hardly equal to not being able to enjoy sex.
85) 5) dialog: What's the point? I have to be up in 15 minutes anyway. Not that I could sleep.
85) 10) dialog: What the fuck is your problem?
85) 14) dialog: Officially?
85) 18) dialog: That doesn't mean anything.
85) 23) dialog: I don't believe you. Just last week you told me the happy should be quarantined. I don't know you anymore.
85) 27) dialog: We broke up for good last night.
85) 34) dialog: I thought I knew what I was doing. Ever since she became my girlfriend, I've felt more and more constricted. Like I was trapped under the weight of the label. "My girlfriend." "Her boyfriend."
85) 38) dialog: Yeah, we were.
85) 42) dialog: Ah, eat shit and die.
86) 41) dialog: Yeah, we just broke up for good.
86) 45) dialog: Me. Us. Both. It was just time, I guess. (puts down the joystick) I have to go, uh, mail a letter or something.
89) 28) dialog: I can't believe I'm graduating next year. I already have a recurring nightmare about it.
89) 49) dialog: Why should I? We've made him sick for years.
89) 53) dialog: It's true!
89) 58) dialog: When are you going to realize I'm a different person and entitled to my opinion? It's my goddamn life!
89) 77) dialog: No. Yes.
89) 97) dialog: Psych is relevant?
93) 6) dialog: Why are humans smarter than chimps if we have 99% of the same genetic material?
93) 10) dialog: Look who I'm asking. You think a red blood cell is a prison for a gang member.
93) 24) dialog: By the way, Max, what ever happened with that girl you were seeing?
93) 42) dialog: Relationships are incredibly complicated. Like polypeptide strings. There's an attraction at first, but if the bonds don't form right away, nothing can make the connection work.
93) 46) dialog: It was like with Jen and I. But I know it was for the best.
93) 58) dialog: Wanna watch Sports Center?
