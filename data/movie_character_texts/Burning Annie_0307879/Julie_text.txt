23) 126) dialog: I'm sorry to interrupt, I thought I heard one of you say "Max."
23) 130) dialog: 
23) 137) dialog: Huh?
23) 142) dialog: You're Max? Then who are you? 24.
23) 148) dialog: 
23) 153) dialog: I'm sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't supposed to listen.
23) 160) dialog: Alright, listen. I was kidding. Your show actually kind of sucked.
23) 164) dialog: Just kidding! It was awesome.
23) 170) dialog: At one point you dialed a phone sex line. It was hilarious. It's not every day someone calls 1-900-4RIMJOBS to discuss politics.
23) 177) dialog: Yeah, it's like, for four dollars a minute, you should talk about whatever you want. You know the country's in trouble when a phone sex operator thinks talking politics is beneath her.
23) 182) dialog: Listen, I'm being flagged down by my over- protective friends. It was nice meeting you, though.
23) 186) dialog: Someone mentioned you.
23) 190) dialog: It was from a good source. I was told I'd like you, but to really know you, I should hear your show.
23) 195) dialog: It was Beth.
29) 4) dialog: Hi. Look at this line. 33.
29) 10) dialog: Aren't ATMs great? They save so much time. Think about what life must have been like before them.
29) 17) dialog: I'm listed as a sophomore, but I've taken some time off.
29) 21) dialog: Why is that always the first question?
29) 25) dialog: And how would you answer it?
29) 29) dialog: I bet. Me, I'm in Soc., but I'm leaning toward Business, or Psych. Or Art History.
29) 35) dialog: Not my style.
29) 38) dialog: Are you okay? I thought you needed money.
29) 42) dialog: Seriously, is everything okay?
29) 46) dialog: What?
29) 50) dialog: It's Julie, no nickname. Don't even think of calling me "Jewel."
29) 54) dialog: Probably.
37) 4) dialog: Max! What's going on?
37) 8) dialog: Do you guys know Max? This is Mark...
37) 12) dialog: ...And Andy.
38) 17) dialog: Sure.
38) 28) dialog: You want mine? 48.
38) 50) dialog: Andy, what are you looking for?
38) 61) dialog: Yeah. I used to, but when it became my social life I knew I needed to stop.
38) 79) dialog: Is his name Bill?
38) 83) dialog: What about originally? 50.
38) 93) dialog: Gee, Mark, that's really cool.
38) 113) dialog: Mark, lay off. Go take a hit off the Hoover and mellow out. (turning to Max) Max, I'm sorry.
38) 120) dialog: Nah, it's time. It's getting late anyway.
39) 5) dialog: No, well, a little, sure. But there are always men around. During fire drills, more guys come out than girls. Never the same ones either. They come and go.
39) 10) dialog: I had a good time tonight, but next time, let's have some real fun.
39) 14) dialog: Good night, Max.
42) 31) dialog: Hello... Big night?
42) 35) dialog: I would hope so. 55.
42) 41) dialog: 
42) 46) dialog: Hey, that's my new major. I got so sick of Soc.
42) 50) dialog: Well, there's a great local band playing the Pub. You should come.
42) 54) dialog: Great. I'll see you there.
45) 4) dialog: Hey!
45) 12) dialog: They're Anhedonia. They're "sludge-core."
45) 17) dialog: That's their trademark. They insult the crowd at the end of the set. Sometimes he breaks the mike two songs in. We were lucky: they played for almost 40 minutes.
45) 23) dialog: Look, the mike's not even broken. They were just tired of playing, but they wanted to give us something to remember. Now that's showmanship.
45) 27) dialog: It worked for The Who.
45) 31) dialog: Ha ha. Come on, is that the kind of a joke a celebrity DJ would make?
45) 35) dialog: You're a riot. Let's get out of here.
46) 5) dialog: Oh, Mark. He's been following me around for years. He's easily threatened.
46) 9) dialog: Don't worry about him, he isn't a threat. You're far more interesting. 59.
46) 16) dialog: You're not fooling me, you know. I can see right through this aloof image.
46) 20) dialog: It's not an insult. I get the sense that there's this whole other side of your personality.
46) 24) dialog: See, this is the side you show, playing everything off as a joke whenever things gets serious. But there's more to you.
46) 28) dialog: Quick. Now. Tell me something about yourself, something I never would have guessed. And don't even try to come up with some witty retort.
46) 31) dialog: I should get going.
46) 41) dialog: (off-balance, covering) I said something I never would have guessed.
46) 45) dialog: Sorry. That wasn't quite what I was looking for.
46) 49) dialog: Let's see. Okay, here's one: I have a boyfriend.
46) 53) dialog: Okay, well, not anymore. Eric and I were together in high school, but we broke up over break.
46) 57) dialog: Yeah. He's kind of a jerk. It was all a waste of time. Sometimes I, I, I don't know, Max, why don't you have a girlfriend?
46) 61) dialog: That's crazy.
46) 65) dialog: And it has a very positive message, too. I wish more guys were into it.
46) 71) dialog: You don't know what I'm wishing for.
46) 75) dialog: Max, there are a lot of girls that would go for a guy like you.
46) 79) dialog: This is one of those moments, in a movie, when a character has a chance to say something, and of course they do, and it's perfect, and it becomes a movie moment.
46) 85) dialog: Are you hungry at all?
46) 89) dialog: Sounds perfect.
46) 94) dialog: Ernest Borgnine? Yeah, I noticed that too.
47) 7) dialog: That's a scary gift. I mean, even if people are destined to break up, the will to stay together is very powerful.
47) 11) dialog: I don't know if your gift is really that special, Max. I mean, we break up with everyone we ever date... Until the one we stay with forever.
47) 15) dialog: How did you get this attitude if you love Annie Hall?
47) 24) dialog: Actually, it's stuck on it. It's how I first heard your show.
47) 28) dialog: It doesn't matter, Max. Now that I've met you, your show's not important. 63.
48) 3) dialog: 
48) 8) dialog: Guys, always obsessed with dick size.
48) 12) dialog: Let's guess which couples are destined to break up. How about them?
48) 18) dialog: Hi! Do you have a boyfriend?
48) 23) dialog: 
48) 30) dialog: Describe him for us. It's okay, I'm a psyche major.
48) 38) dialog: We're not ready, thanks.
48) 43) dialog: Max here thinks you're going to break up with your boyfriend.
48) 50) dialog: Hey! Don't shoot the messenger!
48) 56) dialog: Hey, we're all people here, right? If you want to talk to someone, talk to them. I don't spend my time trying to justify talking to people or whatever. You limit yourself if you do that. If you spend too much time worrying, you don't spend enough time living, right?
48) 60) dialog: You have to keep yourself open to possibilities in life. I'm the first one in my family to go to college. Sometimes I can't believe I'm here, at a semi- prestigious university getting a halfway- decent education-- this has always been my dream. How did you end up here?
48) 64) dialog: I know what you mean, financial aid is a bitch. And the university experience itself is kind of disappointing. All those rich students with no idea how lucky they are. But I don't think about them. I think about me, I think about where I want to be someday: a world traveler, running some huge company, or, you know, doing some fantastically important work. And when the day comes that I can relax, I'm going to charter a boat, sail around the world, and see the Seven Wonders.
48) 68) dialog: Come on, aren't you curious about the world? Doesn't the sheer scope of life fill you with wonder?
48) 72) dialog: Ah, Max...
62) 23) dialog: Max! What are you doing here?
62) 30) dialog: Judy, Mark has the tattoo. This is Max.
62) 34) dialog: Yeah, isn't he great?
62) 39) dialog: What a surprise! What brings you here?
62) 45) dialog: It was excellent, how was yours?
62) 49) dialog: Yeah? Anyone I know?
62) 53) dialog: Really?
62) 57) dialog: For lunch?
72) 5) dialog: It is, but I saw it a couple of weeks ago. I don't think I can sit through it again. You mentioned something about Annie Hall the other night. Do you have that lying around?
72) 9) dialog: Isn't that it on the end there?
72) 13) dialog: Sure it is.
72) 19) dialog: No, it isn't.
72) 23) dialog: You don't believe your friend's theory, right?
72) 27) dialog: Because it's insulting. A cop-out.
72) 31) dialog: Oh, good idea. But next time, Annie Hall.
73) 3) dialog: What are youВ­?
73) 7) dialog: Why did you back away?
73) 11) dialog: It wasn't me, I wouldn't have backed away.
73) 21) dialog: Ow.
73) 25) dialog: No, it's okay.
73) 30) dialog: It's okay. Shut up already.
73) 40) dialog: Nice to meet you guys, but I was just leaving. 85.
73) 46) dialog: I have work to do before class tomorrow.
73) 50) dialog: Sure, all right. Boys, nice to meet you.
74) 3) dialog: I wish I had a cigarette.
74) 7) dialog: Me too. It's strangely sexy when guys smoke.
74) 12) dialog: So. You and Beth are pretty close, huh?
74) 17) dialog: She really cares about you. 86.
74) 23) dialog: It's great that you're still friends.
74) 27) dialog: Sometimes this place annoys me. There's so much bullshit. My semester off was the right idea. What happened to old- fashioned hard work?
74) 34) dialog: Why not just set your tuition on fire?
74) 39) dialog: So, get on up, lazy.
74) 42) dialog: How can you be shy, after, you know...?
74) 46) dialog: You have a problem with nudity. 87.
74) 53) dialog: It's too easy.
74) 58) dialog: A double-shift, I get out at five. This week's gonna suck. I have homework that can't be avoided.
81) 3) dialog: Nice try, Max. I thought you had homework and stuff, you liar. Great song, by the way.
81) 7) dialog: Come on, you're funny, you have good taste in music...
84) 6) dialog: My radio days are over, I'm now deaf.
84) 10) dialog: You were only playing music.
84) 16) dialog: Wow... You're a real piece of work, you know that, Max?
87) 5) dialog: This has been some crazy week. I still have a six page paper due Monday.
87) 9) dialog: Don't worry about it, I needed a break. Good to get out and enjoy the weather.
87) 13) dialog: No.
87) 17) dialog: I'm from northern Vermont. Not too far from Canada.
87) 21) dialog: It sucked but I managed. Read a lot. Had a few close friends. That's all you need. It's quiet up there, dull but nice.
88) 6) dialog: Will you relax? I know how to drive. 95.
88) 12) dialog: 
88) 17) dialog: Oh, yeah?
88) 22) dialog: Did you just call me your girlfriend?
88) 26) dialog: 
89) 17) dialog: Something that pays the bills.
89) 21) dialog: Now I know where you get it from.
89) 89) dialog: Yes, I'm Psych now. I didn't like Soc.
89) 95) dialog: Oh sorry, I just meant, I needed something more, ya know, relevant.
89) 99) dialog: 
89) 108) dialog: Yeah, it's about avoiding the real world for as long as possible.
89) 112) dialog: You call theater the real world?
89) 119) dialog: Look, my parents worked their whole lives to give me the opportunity to be here. But the truth is, private schools like ours make money by showing students a good time for four years. It's bullshit.
89) 125) dialog: That's not what I--
89) 134) dialog: God. What a bunch of spoiled, whiny college brats.
90) 7) dialog: No, it's okay. I just need a few hours to work.
90) 12) dialog: Okay, see you later.
91) 16) dialog: Hey. Sorry I'm late. You wouldn't believe what cross-campus traffic was like.
91) 20) dialog: No, you've got something here that I've been looking forward to all week.
91) 25) dialog: You must face your fears. Relax, it's a very positive film. You just have to know how to look at it. It's really refreshingly positive.
92) 10) dialog: You know, I think I prefer Manhattan.
92) 14) dialog: It's just deeper, more sophisticated, I guess. Listen, thanks for dinner and the movie tonight, but I should get going.
92) 19) dialog: I don't know if this is a good idea right now.
92) 24) dialog: Listen, since the other night, I've been doing some thinking...
92) 28) dialog: I don't think that this is a good time for us to jump, or leap, or whatever, you know, together. Into a relationship.
92) 34) dialog: Did we?
92) 38) dialog: Well, you're right, Max, and this relationship was worth it.
92) 43) dialog: Are you okay? Will you please calm down? I like you very much, but I told you, I just got out of a serious relationship, and it ended really badly. We saw each other almost every day at the beginning, but by the end of the semester, I hadn't seen him in a month. He stopped returning my calls and stuff, and I mean, he basically avoided me, then I heard he was seeing one of my friends.
92) 47) dialog: It's nobody's fault, I know. I mean, I've been trying but it's hard. Relationships are very difficult to maintain. There are so few successful couples.
92) 51) dialog: My parents are divorced.
92) 55) dialog: Max, I did, believe me.
92) 61) dialog: I don't know what I was doing. I didn't think about where this might lead until it was too late.
92) 69) dialog: Say something. Are you okay?
92) 73) dialog: Jesus, Max. It's not an anti-relationship movie.
92) 78) dialog: You're not listening to me, Max. Just like you're not listening to Annie. No matter what you think right now, this was worth it. Because I got to meet you, and got to be close to you.
