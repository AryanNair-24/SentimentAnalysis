12) 10) dialog: Max...
12) 14) dialog: Sure.
12) 18) dialog: I'd love to. How's tomorrow night?
12) 22) dialog: Great. I know the perfect thing.
13) 3) dialog: Never?
13) 7) dialog: A perfect record. Wow.
13) 11) dialog: But you can tell with everybody? I don't know if that's sad or incredible. 9.
13) 17) dialog: Living with you would be a nightmare. I'd be afraid to bring any boyfriends home. Oh, uh, sorry.
13) 22) dialog: You guys never talk about anything important anyway.
13) 26) dialog: Like whether Voltron could kill the Transformers?
13) 30) dialog: For such "close" friends, it just seems weird, that's all. I must admit, I'm a lot closer to you than any of them.
14) 5) dialog: Yes, that's us.
15) 3) dialog: Isn't this great?
15) 7) dialog: What do you mean?
15) 15) dialog: Oh, shhh...!
15) 19) dialog: Can't you just enjoy the moment?
15) 24) dialog: Oh. Yeah.
16) 5) dialog: Yeah. I loved it, I'm serious. I'm so glad we did this.
16) 9) dialog: But man, relationships are a lot of work, aren't they?
16) 16) dialog: If I'm going to jump into anything with you, Max, I need some sign that you're serious about it. About me.
16) 20) dialog: Look, you've gotta admit, you're the most pessimistic person in the world.
16) 24) dialog: Can you be serious for a second?
16) 29) dialog: Look, Max, this isn't going to work.
16) 33) dialog: Okay. No more jokes. Now. Tell me how you feel.
16) 37) dialog: About me.
16) 44) dialog: Well, that was intimate. Thanks, Max. 13.
16) 50) dialog: Max, I don't think this is such a good idea. I mean, it would be really foolish to jeopardize our friendship.
16) 54) dialog: We shouldn't have rushed into this. I'm sure you know it wouldn't have worked out.
16) 58) dialog: Please tell me we haven't hurt our friendship. You don't even know how much you mean to me.
25) 3) dialog: 
27) 3) dialog: Wasn't it supposed to rain? 30.
27) 9) dialog: Max, it's been ten minutes and we're still discussing the weather.
27) 13) dialog: I just feel like there are other things we could be talking about. You're the one person I could rely on to say something original.
27) 18) dialog: This was a mistake, wasn't it?
27) 23) dialog: Look, let's just call it a day. I was excited to hear from you, but I can't take you like this.
28) 12) dialog: I know! I even miss this place. I live on the wrong side of campus now. You guys still come here? It's so dark and the menu is tiny.
28) 29) dialog: Don't worry about it, Jen. He's just incredibly picky about food.
28) 48) dialog: 
28) 55) dialog: Okay, I'll get up. But I'm ordering an omelet.
40) 9) dialog: It was great running into your friends, but... you know... I feel bad about what I said. Do you want to get together later?
40) 13) dialog: Come on, it's bad enough we fell out of touch, but we can't even have lunch?
40) 17) dialog: Every time we try to do anything, you have an excuse, or forget to show up, or you cancel.
40) 21) dialog: I'm sorry. Things have been a little, you know, awkward.
40) 30) dialog: Now you're only going because I gave you a hard time.
40) 34) dialog: Okay, how is the Kidney Bean at noon?
40) 38) dialog: The Fabulous Diner, then. Friday at noon?
59) 3) dialog: Max? What are you doing here? A sudden craving for bird-seed?
59) 7) dialog: Well, be careful, someone in the corner is eating egg salad.
59) 10) dialog: Are you okay?
59) 14) dialog: No reason. Something about you sounded different.
59) 18) dialog: No, actually, last night on the... Oh no, he's here. 71.
59) 25) dialog: Who is he with? He never calls me anymore. I think he might be seeing someone. Have you heard anything?
59) 29) dialog: Sort of. Well, no, I guess not.
59) 34) dialog: I can be a rebel too. The other day I went to bed without flossing.
59) 38) dialog: Okay, it's pathetic, but we're okay, you know? But sometimes, I feel like...
59) 43) dialog: I'm glad you're here, Max. I didn't realize how much I missed you. 72.
59) 49) dialog: That's not what I meant, Max.
70) 3) dialog: (not looking up) So glad you could make it.
70) 7) dialog: Thank God for small favors. 79.
70) 13) dialog: Yeah, a little. This semester isn't shaping up too well. It's tough getting back into the groove of things and, you know, being on campus. Yourself?
70) 17) dialog: But there's something? Really?
70) 21) dialog: Who is it? Do I know her?
70) 25) dialog: Julie! She's great. Why aren't you thrilled?
70) 29) dialog: This I gotta hear.
70) 33) dialog: Well, of course, why do you think I sent her to you?
70) 38) dialog: What're you talking about? 80.
70) 44) dialog: Jeez, she's not like Annie when the film starts, she's like Annie at the end. Or maybe, the Millennium Edition.
70) 48) dialog: Max, what's really the problem here?
70) 52) dialog: You have a type?
70) 56) dialog: Who would you rather sleep with, Julie or Annie Hall?
70) 60) dialog: Okay, Annie Hall or me?
70) 63) dialog: Stop delaying. This is a serious hypothetical question.
70) 70) dialog: I'll take what I can get. 81.
70) 76) dialog: You joke while you're in bed?
70) 80) dialog: That's so weird.
70) 84) dialog: No, it's weird because I do the same thing. Guys find it annoying.
70) 88) dialog: Julie doesn't. And you really like her.
70) 92) dialog: Happiness? Max, you wouldn't know what to do with it if you had it.
89) 10) dialog: Yeah. I've spent my life learning how to be a student, and at the end of the semester it will all be useless. Everybody already wants to know what I'm going to do, and I have no idea. I started making up stories to tell people. An aunt asked me if I'm excited about Chicago, and I couldn't remember if I'd said I was moving to the city or going to see the band.
89) 15) dialog: I can't believe I'm graduating. My whole life, I've known what was next. But when I graduate, the next step is... something?
89) 86) dialog: 
94) 6) dialog: Hi there. Happy Valentine's Day.
94) 10) dialog: Yeah, I hate Valentine's Day, too. If you're in love, you're in love. And if you're not, who wants to think about it? I want to be in love so badly, don't you?
94) 14) dialog: Ah, forget it, Max.
94) 18) dialog: Does a bear shit in the woods?
94) 23) dialog: You told it the night of our date. I hate that joke, Max. It's not a philosophy.
94) 27) dialog: Yeah, and it's dreary and depressing, right?
94) 31) dialog: No?
94) 40) dialog: Really?
94) 44) dialog: Then allow me to recommend a movie that you've never seen before. It's called Annie Hall.
94) 48) dialog: I would love to, but I think you need to do this alone. 109.
94) 54) dialog: But I'll see you later?
94) 58) dialog: The end of an era.
