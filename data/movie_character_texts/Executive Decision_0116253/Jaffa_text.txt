As we study his face the following SUBTITLES APPEAR: Abd Sa'ud Jaffa, once the most notorious and feared terrorist in the world, now a desperate, hunted man, his sanctuaries nearly exhausted, betrayed by even his own people.

Jaffa ex- tends his hands to his daughter who complies, obediently, she too in awe of this powerful, dangerous man, a man she has rarely seen.

He nods differentially to the daughter and then whispers anxiously to Jaffa.

Another car is parked in front of the Fiat, its driver unloading baggage for an Orthodox Greek priest who stands waiting on the sidewalk, eyes half-closed, feeling the heat of the sun on his upturned face. From the hotel lobby, two of Jaffa's guards emerge, one standing lookout, the other walking quickly to the Fiat. Looking cautiously about he leans into the driver, giving instructions. The driver starts the car but before he can back up, a taxi whips in behind, trapping it between the two cars. Three men, obviously drunk, stumble from the cab and head for the lobby, arm-in-arm, talking loudly in German. The terrorist beside the Fiat moves towards the cab, shouting at the driver to back up. The taxi driver emerges, shouting back at the terrorist. They meet at the rear of the car, arguing. Suddenly the taxi driver reaches to his back, whipping free a silenced .22 Beretta automatic. In a flash, the gun is under the chin of the bodyguard, a soft THUMP as the GUN is FIRED. The driver lays the dead bodyguard in the street, swing- ing out and around the car, leveling, FIRING TWICE, the driver in the Fiat slumping down in the seat. At the same moment, the three drunken men reach the lobby doors, one of them pulling a silenced pistol, pressing it into the lookout's stomach, FIRING. As he sits the dead man into the base of a potted tree, the other two push through the doors.

The two boisterous drunks spill through the doors but as they approach Jaffa and his bodyguard, pull their pistols as the Businessman moves in from behind, shoving a pistol into the bodyguard's back, a quick spin, another soft THUMP and the bodyguard drops to the floor. As the stunned patrons and employees look on, Jaffa is moved quickly toward the doors, the Businessman speaking into a lapel mike on his suit.

Just then, Jaffa's backup car pulls around the corner and into the driveway. The three terrorists inside realize what is happening, the doors fling open, their weapons drawn. At this moment, the Greek priest, who has been backing away in mock horror at the kidnapping, clears a MACH TEN MACHINE GUN from his robes, his driver pulling a similar weapon from the trunk. The two OPEN FIRE, the terrorists in the backup car disappearing in a hail of EXPLODING GLASS and ruptured metal. The priest and driver jump into their car, pulling out. As the MERCEDES PEELS OUT behind the priest's car, the businessman leaps into the taxi, hiking out the window and over the roof, FIRING several rounds into the tires and radiator of the Fiat with a SILENCED PISTOL. A second later, one of the priest's suitcases on the sidewalk EXPLODES, a dense cloud of C.S. gas enveloping the area, providing cover.

Seeing the abduction below he leaps from the balcony onto the roof, running across the tiles towards the street. He sights in on the Businessman, hiked out over the cab, but stops short, seeing the silhouette of Jaffa, framed in the back seat, too dangerous a shot for a machine gun. Unwilling to risk hitting him, Ali throws out his arms, screaming a cry of defiance and revenge, his eyes wild with anger and hatred. As the car whips its way through the narrow streets, we hear the following VOICE OVER as we view the series of news reports of terrorist activities including the bomb- ing of a disco; aircraft wreckage; bombing of a military hospital, etc: (CONTINUED )
