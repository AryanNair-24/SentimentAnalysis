Among the passengers is a man, late 40s, European, carrying a small, laptop computer which is being checked by X-ray and a bomb analyzer, a device searching for the scent of plastic explosives. Collecting his computer from the inspection, he lights up a cigarette, looking nervously about him as he does. Behind him, a dark-complected MAN, late 20s, handsome, Mediterranean, dressed in sporty, but expensive outdoor clothing, is insisting that his two heavily-ladened camera bags be hand inspected by the agent.

Mo- ments later a man leaves his seat and we follow his legs as he walks down the aisle, stopping at a seat, the Photojournalist casually looking up before returning to his magazine. The man, wearing horn-rimmed glasses, hair and mustache salt and pepper gray, skin slightly clay- like, looks like a conservative businessman or professor. He opens the overhead, removing one of the camera bags. The man moves on, towards the mid-cabin bathrooms.

Ali turns, FIRING TWICE, point-blank into the man's chest, the high-caliber bul- lets ripping through the seat, also killing a woman sit- ting behind the sailor. Behind him there is a CRASH. Ali spins, raising his weapon, stopping as he sees an attendant, NANCY, backing into the partition, holding her hands over her face, her eyes wide with fear and horror. Ali studies her, calmly, appraisinlgy and then dismissing her, hands the weapon to Kahlil, the photojournalist. As if his point has been made, Ali walks swiftly down the aisle, not bothering to look at another passenger. Somewhere in the main cabin, a hand gripping a .357 Magnum, partially removed from a belt holster, hesitates before returning the revolver. Carefully, the man's hand unsnaps the holster, sliding it and the gun down to his feet where it is secreted in a dress boot, pants leg covering it. Next his Federal I.D. wallet is slipped between the seats. A wave of fear rolls through the passengers as they con- front the horrible reality -- hijacked. In a SERIES OF SHOTS, we see passengers quickly hiding jewelry, watches, Star of David medallions, passports, diamond rings.

As Fran sits, she looks up, seeing the passenger manifest, hanging from the wall. Her eyes go to a name: Edward Strickler, 13-B, United States Fed- eral Air Marshal. As the terrorist turns his back, she pulls the manifest from the clipboard, slipping it into a trash receptacle. She looks up, just as Ali steps into the space. He removes his suit coat, hanging it over some work aprons on the bulkhead. Lifting the intercom handset from the wall, he speaks calmly, in perfect English.

Charlie recovers and stands, FIRING his hand SHOTGUN, point-blank at the Terrorist in the aisleway, spinning to take out another with his pistol. The Terrorist is knocked sideways against the seats, his finger closing on the trigger of his AUTOMATIC WEAPON, letting loose a BURST which rakes across the cabin, SHATTERING TWO WINDOWS. An incredible EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH the PLANE as the aircraft depressurizes, a portion of the hull is ripped away like paper, in an instant two rows of seats vanishin in a gaping hole... Oxygen masks drop as overhead bins erupt, the cabin becoming a hurricane of RUSHING WIND, the plane plummet- ing into a steep dive, the air filled with paper, debris, blankets, food trays, luggage and other flying objects. Charlie is sucked off his feet and slammed against the wall near the gaping hole where the windows used to be. Several passengers grab him, preventing him from going out the window. (CONTINUED )
