As we study his face the following SUBTITLES APPEAR: Abd Sa'ud Jaffa, once the most notorious and feared terrorist in the world, now a desperate, hunted man, his sanctuaries nearly exhausted, betrayed by even his own people.

Another car is parked in front of the Fiat, its driver unloading baggage for an Orthodox Greek priest who stands waiting on the sidewalk, eyes half-closed, feeling the heat of the sun on his upturned face. From the hotel lobby, two of Jaffa's guards emerge, one standing lookout, the other walking quickly to the Fiat. Looking cautiously about he leans into the driver, giving instructions. The driver starts the car but before he can back up, a taxi whips in behind, trapping it between the two cars. Three men, obviously drunk, stumble from the cab and head for the lobby, arm-in-arm, talking loudly in German. The terrorist beside the Fiat moves towards the cab, shouting at the driver to back up. The taxi driver emerges, shouting back at the terrorist. They meet at the rear of the car, arguing. Suddenly the taxi driver reaches to his back, whipping free a silenced .22 Beretta automatic. In a flash, the gun is under the chin of the bodyguard, a soft THUMP as the GUN is FIRED. The driver lays the dead bodyguard in the street, swing- ing out and around the car, leveling, FIRING TWICE, the driver in the Fiat slumping down in the seat. At the same moment, the three drunken men reach the lobby doors, one of them pulling a silenced pistol, pressing it into the lookout's stomach, FIRING. As he sits the dead man into the base of a potted tree, the other two push through the doors.

Just then, Jaffa's backup car pulls around the corner and into the driveway. The three terrorists inside realize what is happening, the doors fling open, their weapons drawn. At this moment, the Greek priest, who has been backing away in mock horror at the kidnapping, clears a MACH TEN MACHINE GUN from his robes, his driver pulling a similar weapon from the trunk. The two OPEN FIRE, the terrorists in the backup car disappearing in a hail of EXPLODING GLASS and ruptured metal. The priest and driver jump into their car, pulling out. As the MERCEDES PEELS OUT behind the priest's car, the businessman leaps into the taxi, hiking out the window and over the roof, FIRING several rounds into the tires and radiator of the Fiat with a SILENCED PISTOL. A second later, one of the priest's suitcases on the sidewalk EXPLODES, a dense cloud of C.S. gas enveloping the area, providing cover.

Seeing the abduction below he leaps from the balcony onto the roof, running across the tiles towards the street. He sights in on the Businessman, hiked out over the cab, but stops short, seeing the silhouette of Jaffa, framed in the back seat, too dangerous a shot for a machine gun. Unwilling to risk hitting him, Ali throws out his arms, screaming a cry of defiance and revenge, his eyes wild with anger and hatred. As the car whips its way through the narrow streets, we hear the following VOICE OVER as we view the series of news reports of terrorist activities including the bomb- ing of a disco; aircraft wreckage; bombing of a military hospital, etc: (CONTINUED )

As Fran sits, she looks up, seeing the passenger manifest, hanging from the wall. Her eyes go to a name: Edward Strickler, 13-B, United States Fed- eral Air Marshal. As the terrorist turns his back, she pulls the manifest from the clipboard, slipping it into a trash receptacle. She looks up, just as Ali steps into the space. He removes his suit coat, hanging it over some work aprons on the bulkhead. Lifting the intercom handset from the wall, he speaks calmly, in perfect English.

With a final effort, Grant knees the Terrorist in the groin, twice, ripping the weapon free, using it to bludgeon the Terrorist to the floor. Grant falls as well, the weapon flying from his hands, lodging under a seat. Grant, exhausted, nearly sick, struggles to his feet and turns. Facing him is Ali Hassan, his face wild and crazed. He raises his weapon, leveling it at Grant... But his eyes go wide in shock as several SHOTS RING OUT. Blood spurts from Hassan's mouth as he turns and falls, face down. Standing behind him is Fran, Grant's .22 automatic in her hand. She looks at the gun, her hand beginning to tremble. Grant takes the weapon, bending to pick up Ali Hassan's weapon as well. As Grant rolls over the body... Ali laughs, a grenade in his hand. He pulls the pin. Instinctively, Grant lunges, his hand grabbing Ali's, holding it and the grenade handle closed. A desperate struggle ensues, Ali fighting to release the grenade, Grant to keep control of Ali's hand while trying to subdue him. As they slam against the outer bulkhead, Grant looks up, seeing an emergency exit door. Wrestling himself into position, Grant kicks upward with all of his strength, the release handle for the door flying, the door pivoting outward as the emergency slide, in an explosion of air, extends... Grant breaks free, shoving Ali backwards. As Ali flies out the door, making a desperate grab for the slide, he drops the grenade, spoon flying, the grenade wedging in the doorway. Ali, arms entangled in a safety line, is ripped to the end of the slide, flapping wildly in the wind. Grant kicks the grenade, dislodging it from the doorframe the grenade skittering down the slide. Ali screams...
