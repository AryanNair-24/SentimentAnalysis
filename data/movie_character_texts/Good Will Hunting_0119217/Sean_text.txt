36) 3) dialog: Maureen?
36) 5) dialog: Keep up the good work, Maureen.  Vinnie?
36) 8) dialog: Don't bullshit me, Vinnie. Didn't  your brother give you the notes?  Okay. If a patient doesn't trust you  then they won't feel safe enough to  be honest with you -- then there's  no point to them being in therapy.  It's like saying -- "Fine, come here  and don't tell me a thing but go  home feeling like you're doing  something about your problems -- and  give me my fifty bucks before you  leave will ya'!"
36) 10) dialog: If you don't help them trust you --  then there's no way you'll ever get  them to sleep with you. And that  should be the goal of any good  therapist. Insecure women, you know...  nail 'em when they're vulnerable,  that's always been my motto.

49) 2) dialog: I was thinking about what you said  to me the other day, about my  painting. I stayed up half the night  thinking about it and then something  occurred to me and I fell into a  deep peaceful sleep and haven't  thought about you since. You know  what occurred to me?
49) 4) dialog: You're just a boy. You don't have  the faintest idea what you're talking  about.
49) 6) dialog: You've never been out of Boston.
49) 8) dialog: So if I asked you about art you could  give me the skinny on every art book  ever written... Michelangelo? You  know a lot about him I bet. Life's  work, criticisms, political  aspirations. But you couldn't tell  me what it smells like in the Sistine  Chapel. You've never stood there and  looked up at that beautiful ceiling.  And if I asked you about women I'm  sure you could give me a syllabus of  your personal favorites, and maybe  you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels  to wake up next to a woman and be  truly happy. If I asked you about  war you could refer me to a bevy of  fictional and non-fictional material,  but you've never been in one. You've  never held your best friend's head  in your lap and watched him draw his  last breath, looking to you for help.  And if I asked you about love I'd  get a sonnet, but you've never looked  at a woman and been truly vulnerable.  Known that someone could kill you  with a look. That someone could rescue  you from grief. That God had put an  angel on Earth just for you.  And  you wouldn't know how it felt to be  her angel. To have the love be there  for her forever. Through anything,  through cancer. You wouldn't know  about sleeping sitting up in a  hospital room for two months holding  her hand and not leaving because the  doctors could see in your eyes that  the term "visiting hours" didn't  apply to you. And you wouldn't know  about real loss, because that only  occurs when you lose something you  love more than yourself, and you've  never dared to love anything that  much. I look at you and I don't see  an intelligent confident man, I don't  see a peer, and I don't see my equal.  I see a boy. Nobody could possibly  understand you, right Will? Yet you  presume to know so much about me  because of a painting you saw.  You  must know everything about me.  You're  an orphan, right?
49) 10) dialog: Do you think I would presume to know  the first thing about who you are  because I read "Oliver Twist?" And I  don't buy the argument that you don't  want to be here, because I think you  like all the attention you're getting.  Personally, I don't care. There's  nothing you can tell me that I can't  read somewhere else.  Unless we talk  about your life. But you won't do  that. Maybe you're afraid of what  you might say.
49) 11) text: Sean stands,
49) 12) dialog: It's up to you.
53) 0) text: Will sits across from Sean completely silent and takes ou pack of cigarettes.
53) 1) dialog: No smoking.
53) 2) text: Will puts the cigarettes away. Sean stares at Will and  occasionally at the clock. Sean continues to check the cl on the wall. It is the only clock in the room and it is B Will. Their hour is almost up. CLOSE ON: WILL'S EYES INTERCUT WITH THE CLOCK. He is counting seconds. As the second hand crosses the tw Will stands up and walks out, leaving Sean alone.
54) 0) text: Lambeau and Sean walk down the hallway after the session.
54) 2) dialog: No, he just sat there and counted  the seconds until the session was  over. It was pretty impressive,  actually.
54) 4) dialog: To show me he doesn't have to talk  to me if he doesn't want to.
54) 6) dialog: I won't talk first.
59) 0) text: Will and Sean sit in silence. A long moment passes. Sean  casually reclines in his chair, disinterested. Will restl looks around the room and then back to Sean. An odd half  smile crosses Sean's face. After a moment:
59) 2) dialog: (smiles) You've never been on a plane.
59) 6) text: Sean smiles.
59) 7) dialog: Yeah? You got a lady now?
59) 9) dialog: How'd it go?
59) 11) dialog: Well, are you going out again?
59) 13) dialog: Why not?
59) 15) dialog: Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
59) 17) dialog: So Christ, call her up.
59) 19) dialog: And right now you're perfect too.  Maybe you don't want to ruin that.
59) 21) dialog: Well, I think that's a great  philosophy Will, that way you can go  through your entire life without  ever having to really know anybody.
59) 22) text: Sean looks directly at Will, who looks away. A beat.
59) 23) dialog: My wife used to turn the alarm clock  off in her sleep. I was late for  work all the time because in the  middle of the night she'd roll over  and turn the damn thing off.  Eventually I got a second clock and  put it under my side of the bed, but  it got to where she was gettin' to  that one too. She was afraid of the  dark, so the closet light was on all  night. Thing kept me up half the  night.  Eventually I'd fall asleep,  out of sheer exhaustion and not wake  up when I was supposed to cause she'd  have already gotten to my alarms.
59) 24) text: Will smiles, Sean takes a beat.
59) 25) dialog: My wife's been dead two years, Will.  And when I think about her, those  are the things I think about most.  Little idiosyncrasies that only I  knew about.  Those made her my wife.  And she had the goods on me too.  Little things I do out of habit.  People call these things imperfections  Will. It's just who we are. And we  get to choose who we're going to let  into out weird little worlds. You're  not perfect. And let me save you the  suspense, this girl you met isn't  either. The question is, whether or  not you're perfect for each other.   You can know everything in the world,  but the only way you're findin' that  one out is by giving it a shot. You  sure won't get the answer from an  old fucker like me. And even if I  did know, I wouldn't tell you.
59) 28) text: Sean laughs.
59) 29) dialog: I teach this shit, I didn't say I  knew how to do it.
59) 31) dialog: My wife's dead.
59) 33) dialog: My wife's dead.
59) 35) text: A beat. Sean smiles.
59) 36) dialog: Time's up.
65) 0) text: Sean and Will in session.
65) 1) dialog: Really? How'd the date go?
65) 3) dialog: No, I don't.
65) 5) dialog: I gave that up when my wife got sick.
65) 7) dialog: (smiles) I didn't write anything else 'cause  nobody, including most of my  colleagues bothered to read the first  one.
65) 9) dialog: Yeah.
65) 11) dialog: Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I  kind of lost touch with him after  Nancy got sick.
65) 13) dialog: What? Do I wonder if I'd be better  off if I never met my wife?
65) 15) dialog: No, that's okay. It's an important  question. 'Cause you'll have your  bad times, which wake you up to the  good stuff you weren't paying  attention to.  And you can fail, as  long as you're trying hard. But  there's nothing worse than regret.
65) 17) dialog: Why? Because of the pain I feel now?  I have regrets Will, but I don't  regret a singel day I spent with  her.
65) 19) dialog: October 21, 1975. Game six of the  World Series. Biggest game in Red  Sox history, Me and my friends slept  out on the sidewalk all night to get  tickets. We were sitting in a bar  waiting for the game to start and in  walks this girl.  What a game that  was. Tie game in the bottom of the  tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk,  hit a long fly ball down the left  field line. Thirty-five thousand  fans on their feet, screamin' at the  ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin'  up the baseline, wavin' at the ball  like a madman. It hits the foul pole,  home run. Thirty-five thousand people  went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
65) 21) dialog: I was havin' a drink with my future  wife.
65) 23) dialog: That's right.
65) 25) dialog: You should have seen this girl. She  lit up the room.
65) 27) text: Sean smiles.
65) 29) dialog: I just slid my ticket across the  table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta  go see about a girl."
65) 31) dialog: They could see that I meant it.
65) 33) dialog: No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I  had gone to see that game I'd be in  here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a  bar twenty years ago. And how I always  regretted not goin' over there and  talkin' to her. I don't regret the  eighteen years we were married. I  don't regret givin' up counseling  for six years when she got sick. I  don't regret being by her side for  the last two years when things got  real bad. And I sure as Hell don't  regret missing that damn game.
65) 36) dialog: (breaking) Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was  gonna hit the home run.

68) 21) dialog: I live right around the corner.
68) 23) dialog: I been here a couple years.
68) 25) dialog: You wanted to talk about Will?
68) 27) dialog: I think so.
68) 29) dialog: We haven't really gotten into it.
68) 31) dialog: Jobs doing what?
68) 33) dialog: That's great, Gerry, that there's  interest -- But I'm not sure he's  ready for that.
68) 35) dialog: What don't I understand?
68) 37) dialog: Thanks, Timmy.
68) 51) dialog: Isn't that a little dramatic, Gerry?
68) 54) dialog: He married his cousin.
68) 56) dialog: Einstein. Had two marriages, both  trainwrecks.  The guy never saw his  kids, one of whom, I think, ended up  in an asylum- possible Unabomber  addition--
68) 58) dialog: I do.
68) 62) dialog: Just... take it easy, Gerry.
68) 64) dialog: Maybe he doesn't care about that.
68) 67) dialog: Now wait a minute, Gerry--
68) 69) dialog: Personal rivalry? I'm not getting  back at you.
68) 71) dialog: Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think  it's fine with you. Give him time to  figure out what he wants.

85) 3) dialog: Gerry says the meeting went well.
85) 5) dialog: What did you think?
85) 11) dialog: Do you think you're alone?
85) 13) dialog: Do you have a soul-mate?
85) 15) dialog: Someone who challenges you in every  way.  Who takes you places, opens  things up for you. A soul-mate.
85) 17) text: Sean waits.
85) 19) dialog: They're all dead.
85) 21) dialog: But you can't give back to them,  Will.
85) 23) dialog: That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll  never have that kind of relationship  in a world where you're afraid to  take the first step because all you're  seeing are the negative things that  might happen ten miles down the road.
85) 25) dialog: Don't give me your line of shit.
85) 27) dialog: It's not about that job. I'm not  saying you should work for the  government. But, you could do anything  you want. And there are people who  work their whole lives layin' brick  so their kids have a chance at the  kind of opportunity you have. What  do you want to do?
85) 29) dialog: Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
85) 31) dialog: You're right, Will. Any man who takes  a forty minute train ride so those  college kids can come in in the  morning and their floors will be  clean and their trash cans will be  empty is an honorable man.
85) 33) dialog: And when they get drunk and puke in  the sink, they don't have to see it  the next morning because of you.  That's real work, Will. And there is  honor in that.  Which I'm sure is  why you took the job.
85) 35) dialog: I just want to know why you decided  to sneak around at night, writing on  chalkboards and lying about it. (beat) 'Cause there's no honor in that.
85) 37) dialog: Something you want to say?
85) 38) text: Sean gets up, goes to the door and opens it.
85) 39) dialog: Why don't you come back when you  have an answer for me.
85) 41) dialog: If you won't answer my questions,  you're wasting my time.
85) 45) text: Sean has finally gotten to Will.
85) 47) text: Sean lets this play out. Possible "shepard" change.
85) 49) dialog: I been there. I played my hand.
85) 51) dialog: Look at me. What do you want to do?
85) 53) dialog: You and your bullshit. You got an  answer for everybody. But I asked  you a straight question and you can't  give me a straight answer. Because  you don't know.
85) 54) text: Sean goes to the door and opens it. Will walks out.
90) 0) text: Lambeau stands across from Sean, seething.

90) 6) dialog: Hold on!
90) 8) dialog: I know what I'm doing and I know why  I'm here!
90) 10) dialog: "Undermine?"
90) 12) dialog: He is at a fragile point. He's got  problems--
90) 14) dialog: Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
90) 16) dialog: Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because  the first thing that happened to him  was that he was abandoned by the  people who were supposed to love him  the most!
90) 18) dialog: And why does he hang out with his  friends? Because any one of those  kids would come in here and take a  bat to your head if he asked them  to. It's called loyalty!
90) 20) dialog: And who do you think he's handling?   He pushes people away before they  have a chance to leave him. And for  20 years he's been alone because of  that. And if you try to push him  into this, it's going to be the same  thing all over again. And I'm not  going to let that happen to him!
90) 22) dialog: --I'm not angry at you--
90) 24) dialog: --I don't have any anger at you--
90) 26) dialog: That's it. That's why I don't come  to the goddamn reunions!  Because I  can't stand the look in your eye  when you see me! You think I'm a  failure! I know who I am. I'm proud  of who I am. And all of you, you  think I'm some kind of pity case!  You with your sycophant students  following you around. And your Goddamn  Medal!
90) 28) dialog: I don't want your trophy and I don't  give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew  you when!! You and Jack and Tom  Sanders. I knew you when you were  homesick and pimply-faced and didn't  know what side of the bed to piss  on!
90) 30) dialog: I don't blame you! It's not about  that!  It's about the boy! 'Cause  he's a good kid! And I won't see  this happen to him- won't see you  make him feel like a failure too!
90) 32) dialog: If you push him into something, if  you ride him--
90) 34) dialog: He's not you!
90) 35) text: A beat. Lambeau turns, something catches his eye. Sean tu to look, IT'S WILL. He is standing in the doorway.
90) 40) dialog: Look, a lot of that stuff goes back  a long way. And it's between me and  him and it has nothing to do with  you.
90) 42) text: Sean smiles. A beat. Will sees a FILE on Sean's desk.
90) 44) dialog: Oh, this is your file. I have to  send it back to the Judge with my  evaluation.
90) 46) text: Sean smiles.
90) 48) dialog: You want to read it?
90) 50) dialog: Twenty years of counseling you see a  lot of--
90) 52) dialog: Yes.
92) 1) dialog: (after a pause) My dad used to make us walk down to  the park and collect the sticks he  was going to beat us with. Actually  the worst of the beatings were between  me and my brother. We would practice  on each other trying to find sticks  that would break.
94) 1) dialog: Gotta go with the belt there...
94) 3) dialog: The wrench, why?
94) 7) dialog: I didn't know you had. Do you want  to talk about that? (beat) I don't know a lot, Will. But let me  tell you one thing. All this history,  this shit... (indicates file) Look here, son.
94) 8) text: Will, who had been looking away, loos at Sean.
94) 9) dialog: This is not your fault.
94) 11) dialog: It's not your fault.
94) 13) dialog: It's not your fault.
94) 15) dialog: It's not your fault.
94) 17) dialog: It's not your fault.
