13) 0) text: The classroom is even more crowded than last we saw it. T takes notes as Lambeau plays along with the excited  environment with mock pomposity and good humor.
13) 1) dialog: Is it my imagination, or has my class  grown considerably?
13) 3) dialog: I look around and see young people  who are my students, young people  who are not my students as well as  some of my colleagues. And by no  stretch of my imagination do I think  you've all come to hear me lecture.

13) 9) dialog: Well, I'm sorry to disappoint my  spectators, but it appears there  will be no unmasking here today. I'm  going to have to ask those of you  not enrolled in the class to make  your escape now or, for the next  three hours be subjected to the  mundities of eigenvectors.
13) 10) text: People start to gather their things and go. Lambeau picks a piece of chalk and starts writing on the board.

He's also published  four books and is widely considered  to be one of the brightest men in  his field. (beat) I'm sure it'll be better than spending  the next six months in jail.

33) 10) dialog: That would be a monumental waste of  time, wouldn't it, Will?
33) 12) dialog: I happen to know so.
33) 13) text: Lambeau rises and goes to the board.
33) 14) dialog: You're thinking too hard. What if I  did this?
33) 16) dialog: Now, what if I do this?
33) 18) dialog: Have you ever played checkers?
33) 19) text: Will realizes what Lambeau is getting at. In a flash he s drawing lines through the diagram, energized.
33) 21) text: Lambeau steps in, writing with him [Will].
33) 22) dialog: What's that?
33) 24) dialog: --that?--
33) 26) dialog: --That edge!
33) 29) dialog: (checks his watch) It would appear we got that proof in  under the wire after all. It's not  how hard you look at things, young  man, it's the way you look at them.  If you take aim before you fire, you  will find the most difficult problems  become, quite literally, child's  play.
33) 31) dialog: Will, you've managed to offend four  of my colleagues so much that they  refused to come back. You're meeting  with the leading hypnotist in the  country next week and Tom and I plan  to sit in on the sessions, so I expect  you to behave appropriately.

41) 7) dialog: He was alive over a hundred years  ago.  He was Indian. Dots, not  feathers...
41) 8) text: Sean finishes the joke. Lambeau chuckles.
41) 9) dialog: So this Ramanujan lived in a tiny  hut in India. No formal education,  no access to other works. But he  came across an old math book and  from this basic text he was able to  extrapolate theories that had baffled  mathematicians for years.
41) 11) dialog: That's right, Sean. He mailed it to  a professor at Cambridge who  immediately recognized the brilliance  in his work and brought Ramanujan to  England.
41) 13) dialog: They worked together for the remainder  of their lives, producing some of  the most exciting math theory ever  done.  Ramanujan's genius was  unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like  that. But he's very defensive and I  need someone who can get through to  him.
41) 15) dialog: I need someone with your kind of  background.
41) 17) dialog: You're from the same neighborhood.  South Boston.

43) 3) dialog: It's a poker game with this young  man.  Don't let him see what you've  got.
43) 5) dialog: Hello, Will. Any trouble finding the  place?
43) 7) dialog: Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean,  Will Hunting.

58) 0) text: Will and Lambeau work together at the board. They communi non-verbally as they collaborate on a problem. After a  particularly amusing series of numbers, they share a look and laugh.
65) 40) dialog: Alexander, I know your theory. The  boy is updating, he's strategy  stealing...
65) 42) dialog: --But what he's doing, he's attaching  an edge to the adjacent vertex. He  can always failsafe to either side--
65) 46) dialog: No, there's a limit.
65) 50) text: Lambeau can no longer contain himself.
65) 51) dialog: Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is  three to the K times--

67) 7) dialog: Was I exaggerating in nineteen eighty- four when I told you I'd win the  Field's medal within two years?

68) 20) dialog: You're here quite a bit, then.
68) 22) dialog: You moved?
68) 26) dialog: Seems like it's going well.
68) 28) dialog: Well, have you talked to him at all  about his future?
68) 30) dialog: Maybe you should. My phone's been  ringing off the hook with job offers.
68) 32) dialog: Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like  Will's is given free reign.
68) 34) dialog: Sean, I really don't think you  understand--
68) 38) dialog: Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
68) 40) dialog: Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
68) 42) dialog: You've heard of Albert Einstein?
68) 44) dialog: How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard  of him?
68) 46) dialog: Okay thank you, Timmy.
68) 48) dialog: I did.
68) 50) dialog: This isn't about me. I'm nothing  compared to this young man. (beat) Sean, in 1905 there were hundreds of  Professors who were renowned for  their study of the universe. But it  was a 26-year-old Swiss Patent clerk,  doing physics in his spare time, who  changed the world, Sean. Can you  imagine if Einstein had given that  up? Or gotten drunk with his buddies  in Vienna every night? All of us  would have lost something. And I'm  quite sure Timmy never would have  heard of him.
68) 52) dialog: No, Sean. This boy has that gift. He  just hasn't got the direction. We  can give that to him.
68) 55) dialog: Who?
68) 57) dialog: You see, Sean? That's exactly not  the point. No one remembers that.  They--
68) 59) dialog: Well, you're the only one.
68) 61) dialog: This boy can make contributions to  the world. We can help him do that.
68) 63) dialog: Look, I don't know what else I can  say.  I'm not sitting at home every  night, twisting my mustache and  hatching a plan to ruin the boy's  life. But it's important to start  early. I was doing advanced  mathematics at eighteen and it still  took me twenty-three years to do  something worthy of a Field's medal.
68) 66) dialog: Sean, this is important. And it's  above personal rivalry--
68) 68) dialog: No, no you hear me out, Sean. This  young man is a true prodigy--
68) 70) dialog: Look, you took one road and I took  another. That's fine.
68) 72) dialog: That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It  worked wonders for you.
68) 73) text: A beat. Lambeau gets up.
68) 74) dialog: Sean, I came here today out of  courtesy.  I wanted to keep you in  the loop. As we speak the boy is in  a meeting I set up for him over at  Tri-tech.
73) 0) text: Tom and Will are sitting waiting for Lambeau.
73) 3) text: Lambeau enters going over a thick proof Will has complete
73) 4) dialog: This is correct. I see you used  Mclullen here--
73) 6) dialog: --This can't be right. (examining proof) This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
73) 10) dialog: That's fine, but did you ever think--
73) 12) dialog: Will, what happened at the Tri-tech  meeting?
73) 14) dialog: Will, on your own time, you can do  what you like. When I set up a  meeting, with my associates, and you  don't show up it reflects poorly on  me.
73) 16) dialog: I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just  wanted you to see what was out there.
73) 18) dialog: The least you can do is show me a  little appreciation.
73) 20) dialog: Sure, then you'd have more time to  sit around and get drunk. Think of  how many fights you could have been  in by now.
73) 21) text: Will turns around reveling that he's lit the PROOF ON FIR Will drops it on the floor. Lambeau drops to his knees an puts it out. He looks up at Will.
73) 22) dialog: You're right, Will. I can't do that  proof and you can. And when it comes  to this there are only twenty people  in the world that can tell the  difference between you and me. But  I'm one of them.
73) 24) dialog: So am I. (beat) Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I  wish I never met you. Because then I  could sleep at night. I wouldn't  have to walk around with the knowledge  that someone like you was out there.  And I wouldn't have to watch you  throw it all away.
73) 25) text: Lambeau gathers his composure and calmly walks over to th wrinkled proof. He picks it up, smooths it out.

82) 1) dialog: What are you smiling at?
82) 3) text: Will can see that Lambeau wants more.
82) 5) dialog: No.
84) 4) dialog: I've got the first part. The rest I  can do at home.
84) 6) dialog: Will, the N.S.A. has been calling me  just about every hour. They're very  excited about how the meeting went.
84) 7) text: Lambeau is excited. Will clearly is not.
87) 0) text: Lambeau and Tom are in his office. Will is nowhere to be  seen. Lambeau is on the phone.
87) 1) dialog: What I mean, Sean, is that I'm sitting  in your office and the boy isn't  here. (beat) Well, it's ten past three. (beat) An hour and ten minutes late. (beat) Well, if he doesn't show up and I  have to file a report saying he wasn't  here and he goes back to jail, it  won't be on my conscience, Sean. (beat) Fine.
87) 4) dialog: The boy was here. He came in, sat  down and we worked together.
87) 6) dialog: He came in, sat down, and we worked  together.
90) 0) text: Lambeau stands across from Sean, seething.
90) 1) dialog: This is a disaster! I brought you in  here to help me with this boy, not  to run him out--
90) 3) dialog: --And confuse him--
90) 5) dialog: And here I am for the second week in  a row with my professional reputation  at stake--
90) 7) dialog: Ready to falsify documents because  you've given him license to walk  away from this.
90) 9) dialog: Look Sean, I don't care if you have  a rapport with the boy -- I don't  care if you have a few laughs --  even at my expense! But don't you  dare undermine what I'm trying to do  here.
90) 11) dialog: He has a gift and with that gift  comes responsibility. And you don't  understand that he's at a fragile  point--
90) 13) dialog: What problems does he have, Sean,  that he is better off as a janitor  or in jail or hanging around with--
90) 15) dialog: He can handle the work, he can handle  the pressure and he's obviously  handled you.
90) 17) dialog: Oh, come on, Sean--
90) 19) dialog: Oh, that's nice--
90) 21) dialog: Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that  it's okay to quit. That it's okay to  be a failure, because it's not okay!  If you're angry at me for being  successful, for being what you could  have been--
90) 23) dialog: Yes you are, Sean. You resent me.  And I'm not going to apologize for  any success that I've had.
90) 25) dialog: Yes you do. You're angry at me for  doing what you could have done. Ask  yourself if you want Will to feel  that way for the rest of his life,  to feel like a failure.
90) 27) dialog: Is that what this is about, Sean?  The Field's Medal? Do you want me to  go home and get it for you? Then  will you let the boy--
90) 29) dialog: That's right!  You were smarter than  us then and you're smarter than us  now! So don't blame me for how your  life turned out. It's not my fault.
90) 31) dialog: He won't be a failure!
90) 33) dialog: You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am  today because I was pushed. And  because I learned to push myself!
90) 35) text: A beat. Lambeau turns, something catches his eye. Sean tu to look, IT'S WILL. He is standing in the doorway.
90) 37) dialog: No, that's fine, Will. I was just  leaving.
90) 38) text: There is an awkward moment as Lambeau gets his coat and  leaves.
