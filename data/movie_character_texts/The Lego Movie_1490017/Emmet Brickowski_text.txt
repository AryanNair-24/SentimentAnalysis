6) 17) dialog: It's always clean!
6) 22) dialog: What's the point of having my own apartment across the hall from your apartment if you're going to check up on me like I still live at home?
6) 27) dialog: Mom. I've spent my whole life here. I need to go out there and follow my dream of fitting in and being like everybody else.
6) 31) dialog: Mom, please!
6) 35) dialog: (changing the subject) Mom... I had the dream again.
8) 10) dialog: I just want to be normal, Mom.
8) 15) dialog: You mean it?
8) 19) dialog: Are you crying?
8) 26) dialog: Promise.
8) 30) dialog: Of course.
8) 34) dialog: I never do.
8) 38) dialog: Always.
8) 42) dialog: Love you, Mom.
9) 6) dialog: Yeah. I love this song! And so does everyone else!
11) 3) dialog: Hello.
11) 7) dialog: I'm Emmet. 9.
11) 12) dialog: Well, Larry, I'll have one coffee please.
11) 16) dialog: What are those? Sounds a little foofy.
11) 20) dialog: Oh. Well, whatever isn't too wild. I don't know, what do you think?
11) 25) dialog: Okay, yeah. Cool.
11) 29) dialog: Oh, goodness. So much selection. So hard to decide! You pick.
11) 33) dialog: Uh. Gosh, which is the most popular?
11) 37) dialog: Medium. That's what I'm havin'! That is my style.
11) 42) dialog: You creative types! So delightfully sardonic!
11) 46) dialog: But it says Kreative right on your shirt! With an extra "kreative" spelling aberration! I totally don't get it!
13) 5) dialog: Ooh, great.
13) 9) dialog: Mmm hmm.
13) 13) dialog: Uh huh. 11.
13) 19) dialog: Oh, Steve, don't worry. I'm not some kind of foofy weirdo, Steve!
15) 5) dialog: Is it for an artist?
15) 9) dialog: Oh, great.
15) 13) dialog: Wow... 12.
15) 17) dialog: What if I mess up or lose my place or something?
15) 21) dialog: Overseas? I don't know. I'm not big on travel.
15) 25) dialog: One more question.
15) 28) dialog: Thank you. For making my dreams come true.
17) 3) dialog: So.
17) 7) dialog: How about that local sports team? What do you think of how they played the other day?
17) 11) dialog: Right? They should make a personnel change of some kind.
17) 16) dialog: Yes, the coach!
17) 20) dialog: They should so keep him!
17) 24) dialog: Really?!
17) 29) dialog: Cool. Definitely cool.
17) 37) dialog: I think I know why I like that song so much.
17) 41) dialog: Because everything is awesome.
18) 7) dialog: Oh, uh. I don't know. What?
18) 11) dialog: I don't know what happened. I was just looking out at the clouds, and-- It was an accident.
18) 17) dialog: Code Danger? What's so dangerous? 15.
18) 21) dialog: Oh.
22) 4) dialog: --unbelievably sorry. I am honestly the last person who would do something like thi--
23) 3) dialog: --eriously, a model citizen. I got straight As. I vote! Even in the off-year elections, for school board and stuff--
24) 3) dialog: --swear, I'm not special at all. Just ask my mom! I'm a totally average normal person!
24) 7) dialog: Super grande.
24) 11) dialog: You don't need to break me! I'm just a regular old totally
25) 3) dialog: I'm Emmet. What's your name?
26) 3) text: Doris sees the brick happy face and knows it has to be Emmet! She looks worried. Then oddly STEELY.  
27) 1) text: Emmet lies awake, sad.  
28) 1) text: Something is moving in the field outside Emmet's Cell. It's DORIS! She pulls apart bricks in the ground.  
29) 1) text: CLOSE ON A RACQUEL WELCH POSTER. A blowdart gun emerges from her belly-button. TH-THOONK! Two guards outside Emmet's cell go down. DORIS bursts through the poster! 
29) 2) text: The following conversation is WHISPERED.  EMMET
29) 4) text: I'm breaking you out.  EMMET
29) 6) text: Well I'm temporarily reversing my position for reasons of convenience.  EMMET
29) 8) text: The rules are different now.  EMMET
29) 10) text: No you didn't.  EMMET
29) 12) text: Great. Fine. Would you mind holding my purse?  EMMET
29) 14) text: THOONK! Doris blowdarts Emmet, who passes out. Doris drags Emmet by the purse through the hole.  
30) 1) text: Doris and Emmet tunnel in, to the surprise of CUSTOMERS. Doris tries to make Emmet seem like a normal shopper. He is still holding her purse in a coma-grip. 
31) 1) text: Doris pushes him in a shopping cart through the parking lot and into an ALLEY. Emmet comes to.  EMMET
31) 3) text: Saving your life. 19.   EMMET
31) 5) text: That's not important.  EMMET
31) 7) text: I just broke you out of prison!  EMMET
31) 9) text: They won't ever decide. You don't UNDERSTAND--  EMMET
31) 11) text: You were supposed to have dinner with me.  EMMET
31) 13) text: Well it feels amazing to spend twenty years loving and protecting someone and the first day out of the nest they wind up on the news.  EMMET
31) 15) text: It's for your own good. 20.   EMMET
31) 18) text: A beat. Doris continues but Emmet doesn't follow.  EMMET
31) 20) text: You have to trust me--  EMMET
31) 22) text: I tried, and look what happened!  EMMET
31) 24) text: As a matter of fact I did. All the time.  EMMET
31) 26) text: He turns away from her. Behind Emmet, three ROBOTIC NINJAS silently land, and shoot a human-sized RUBBER BAND from a bent PAPERCLIP at Doris-- it wraps around her, tying her up! They grab her and pull her into a SLEEK
31) 28) text: Emmet!  EMMET
31) 31) dialog:  EMMET
31) 33) text: Emmet is TACKLED by a hooded figure: GEMINI.  GEMINI
31) 34) text: Where did she go?!  EMMET
31) 36) text: Gemini grabs a mailbox and STARTS TAKING IT APART! Does the same with the shopping cart and other nearby items, REBUILDING them into an awesome mailbox-style SUPERCYCLE!  EMMET
31) 38) text: Gemini takes OFF! Emmet, in pursuit, runs into TRAFFIC. He flags down a DUMPY CAR.  EMMET
31) 42) text: Emmet gets in and slams his foot on the gas!  BARRISTA
31) 43) text: What's with the purse?  EMMET (OVERLAPPING)
34) 1) text: Gemini tries to keep up with the ninja car. Emmet, in Larry's car, catches up. They are going super fast and dodging cars while screaming across traffic. 
34) 2) text: Emmet leans out of the car.  EMMET
34) 4) text: Stop, Emmet! You're going to screw everything up!  EMMET
34) 6) text: He loses control of the car and CRASHES INTO Gemini! The cars tumble in a big heap. You can't tell where the car stops and the motorcycle begins. Larry and Emmet are upside down in seatbelts. 
34) 7) text: Gemini is thrown from the cycle during the crash, but gets up and rebuilds the two vehicles into one SUPER CAR CYCLE that's a mashup of both! Gemini is in the driver's seat, Emmet in passenger, and Larry in the back.  LARRY
34) 12) text: The new vehicle hits the ground and continues in pursuit.  EMMET
34) 14) text: Emmet. 
34) 15) text: Gemini drops the cloak hood, revealing...  EMMET
34) 17) text: It's Gemini now.  EMMET
34) 20) text: She builds the glove compartment and antenna into a CROSSBOW and ARROW.  EMMET
35) 1) text: Doris, tied up, sees Lucy and Emmet in pursuit.  DORIS
35) 2) text: Emmet?! (TO ROBO-NINJAS)
36) 1) text: The two cars are TETHERED TOGETHER as they race through the streets, making the chase even more BADASS.  EMMET
36) 3) text: Is this really the best time to talk?  EMMET
36) 6) text: Lucy pulls out a pistol, leans out the window, and returns fire as the bad guys shoot at them.  EMMET
36) 9) text: Hardly.  EMMET
36) 14) text: By the way, I'm seeing someone now, so don't get any ideas.  EMMET
36) 18) text: The cops start to shoot at them.  EMMET
36) 21) text: You don't get it, do you?  EMMET
36) 23) text: They're here for the Chosen One.  EMMET
36) 25) text: Not you. Your mom.  EMMET
36) 28) text: I was sent to get her, but they got to her first. 26.   EMMET
36) 30) text: Emmet, your mother is the most powerful being in the universe.  EMMET
36) 35) text: This sinks in.  EMMET
37) 2) text: How... Emmet! Jump! 
37) 3) text: At the last possible second, Lucy jumps off the car. Emmet jumps out of his car. The ninja car flies off the end of the train and through a BUILDING. Nothing happens to the Viking car, but Lucy and Emmet's car SMASHES into a thousand pieces. They land with a THUD.  EMMET
37) 5) text: It didn't break. How?  EMMET
37) 7) text: Lucy pulls Emmet behind a DUMPSTER as the police arrive at the scene and COVER UP the hole in the wall.  BAD COP
37) 10) text: Lucy and Emmet run away. Larry the Barrista emerges from the rubble, unseen by the cops.  LARRY
37) 12) text: He gets up and walks O.S., right past an open sewer grate where Emmet and Lucy once were.  
38) 1) text: Emmet and Lucy wade through the sewers.  EMMET
38) 3) text: You have a lot of questions. 28.   EMMET
38) 5) text: They all work for the Black Falcon.  EMMET
38) 7) text: Otherwise known as Rodrigo Falcone, the C.E.O. of Empura?  EMMET
38) 9) text: He is also the self-declared Emperor of all known LEGO realms. He kidnapped your mom because she is the only one who can stop him from destroying us all.  EMMET
38) 11) text: Emmet, did your mom have a safe deposit box, a safe, something where she would have hidden something very valuable?  EMMET
38) 14) text: (pulling out items) No...no...no...no...no...no... No...no...no...no...no...no...  EMMET
38) 19) text: Emmet pulls it away. A RATTLE. 
38) 20) text: Lucy pulls Emmet back and finds a FALSE COMPARTMENT. In it is a lock box. It has a combination lock.  LUCY
38) 21) text: What's her birthday?  EMMET
38) 24) text: Of course. Your birthday. January six.  EMMET (TOUCHED)
38) 28) text: The MasterPiece.  EMMET
38) 31) text: Some say it's the first piece ever. No one knows exactly what it does, but it is said the Chosen One will use it to one day save the world.  EMMET
38) 34) text: There is an inscription. Etched all around it.  EMMET
38) 36) text: The prophecy of the Chosen One...  EMMET
38) 38) text: Yes. We have to get this to your mom so she can fulfill her destiny and stop the Black Falcon before he destroys us all.  EMMET
38) 41) text: Emmet goes up to the MasterPiece, upset. He touches it, feeling sorry for himself. The second Emmet touches it... WHAM!!!!  SMASH TO:  
39) 5) text: Emmet lets go, catching his breath. The purse is now free from his hand. 31.   EMMET
39) 10) text: COPS enter the sewer. Emmet puts the MasterPiece back in his mom's purse and wears it like a backpack. Lucy and Emmet dash out. 
39) 11) text: A FOOTCHASE ENSUES between the cops and Lucy and Emmet. Lucy uses her powers to dash through buildings and shops and lose the cops, breaking apart walls and rebuilding them behind her. Emmet keeps up, barely.  EMMET
39) 13) text: We're going to take the MasterPiece to someone who can help.  EMMET
39) 16) text: She turns away, remembering. It's painful.  EMMET
39) 18) text: Vitruvius. He was once a great MasterBuilder, now he's...retired. But he's our only hope.  EMMET
39) 20) text: Emmet lamely imitates her quickbuild kung-fu.  LUCY
39) 21) text: I can't, I'm...still in training. I'm not a full-fledged MasterBuilder yet. Technically, I'm an intern. 32.   EMMET
40) 1) text: There's a big sign that tells us "CITY LIMITS. NO EXIT/NO ENTRY." And a literal line across the ground. Emmet stops short of the line.  EMMET
40) 3) text: Don't be a putz, Emmet.  EMMET
40) 5) text: Iamnotarobot is one of the Black Falcon's robot henchmen. Ever notice how metallic he looks?  EMMET
40) 7) text: Don't be naГЇve.  EMMET
40) 10) text: She steps across the line. Emmet GASPS for a long time.  LUCY
40) 11) text: Look, just give me the MasterPiece and I'll take it from here. 33.   EMMET
40) 13) text: Well then I guess you're going to have to cross that line.  EMMET
40) 15) text: Well then go ahead and do it.  EMMET
40) 18) text: Dude!  EMMET
40) 20) text: Emmet deliberately and meaningfully, in super slow motion, crosses the line. He EXHALES DRAMATICALLY. Takes another step. Then another, then-- SLAM! 
40) 21) text: Emmet has walked straight into an INVISIBLE WALL! Camera COMES AROUND revealing a trompe l'oeil painting on bricks that go up as far as the eye can see.  LUCY
40) 23) text: Lucy reveals an odd-shaped DEPRESSION in the wall. She takes apart a nearby VENDING MACHINE and rearranges the pieces into the shape of the depression, puts it in, filling the negative space...and it opens a door. Lucy pulls Emmet into the door and into... 
40) 24) text: A TUNNEL OF LIGHT - just like at the beginning of the movie. It seems peaceful, until we see that Emmet and Lucy are hurtling towards a monolithic wall. They BLAST THROUGH IT and into...  
41) 2) text: Lucy and Emmet crash land into a bunch of HOBBIT HOUSES. They get out of the ship and look around. They see a lot of hobbits yelling at them for destroying their shire.  EMMET
41) 4) text: Annoying short whiners. Plus they reproduce like crazy. It's a real problem.  EMMET
41) 7) text: A SCARY NOISE. The Hobbits scurry into their houses. Emmet and Lucy get down just before an army of robots riding robo-horses marches by.  EMMET
41) 9) text: The Black Falcon's sentries. They're looking for us.  EMMET
41) 12) text: A robot turns its head. Almost spots them, then moves away. Lucy bonks Emmet on the head and they dash away.  
44) 49) text: Doris can't look at him. BF shows her a poster with a goofy image of Emmet. "Wanted: Broken or Together."  BLACK FALCON
44) 53) text: He grabs a LEGO MAGNIFYING GLASS from his desk and shows Doris the out-of-focus PURSE Emmet's holding in the Wanted photo.  BLACK FALCON
45) 1) text: They come upon a majestic canyon with an immense LEGO waterfall (clear pieces tumbling down). Lucy climbs up the rock wall. Emmet follows.  EMMET
45) 3) text: Do you ever say something that isn't a stupid question?  EMMET
45) 9) text: Lucy knocks on the door of a garishly painted SHACK.  EMMET
45) 13) text: Hello! What? Hi!  EMMET
46) 1) text: Looks like it was decorated by a blind man. And it was. Vitruvius opens the shades, revealing a window view of a rock wall. 41.   EMMET
46) 3) text: Thank you. I am deprived of my sight, but my hearing is so acute that I can still perceive the physical world using echolocation.  EMMET
46) 5) text: Precisely. I see with my ears. Now, how can I help you, extremely tall and fat stranger?  EMMET
46) 12) text: I guess I'm not redundant anymore.  EMMET
46) 28) text: They were probably right.  EMMET
46) 32) text: That's flattery, my dear. We both know you're only here because you have no other place to go.  EMMET
47) 2) text: The Kragle is the most powerful relic of the Maker. 44.   EMMET
47) 4) text: Emmet and Lucy sit at a "table." AKA a pink ERASER.  VITRUVIUS
47) 5) text: The Maker. The being who put us all together and watches over us. Only by following the inspiration of the Maker can one become a true MasterBuilder.  EMMET
47) 7) text: It is, but then all the best things are.  EMMET
47) 9) text: Every so often, the Maker drops a piece down to us that is unique, unlike any other. This crystal table is but one example. Some of them, in the wrong hands, can be weaponized. The Kragle, if harnessed, could--  EMMET
47) 13) text: If we can travel across sea and land, penetrate his heavily- guarded fortress, unkidnap Master Doris, and bring the MasterPiece safely to her, she can use it to destroy the Kragle, and set the world right. 45.   EMMET
47) 18) text: Or we could send out a mass email to the MasterBuilders list, and have whichever ones are remaining meet us at the midpoint.  EMMET
48) 1) text: A bustling colonial-era port, but with every possible kind of ship, from aircraft carrier to canoe. Emmet, Lucy, Vitruvius, and Dragon sneak down a DOCK disguised as FISHERMEN. Dragon is disguised as a FISH.  EMMET
48) 3) text: Why do you care? 46.   EMMET
48) 7) text: Ahoy! Welcome to the Sea Cow!  EMMET
48) 9) text: Neckbeard hops out onto the dock, revealing he HAS NO BODY. He's just a head. And a beard.  EMMET
48) 12) text: She does.  EMMET
48) 14) text: Neckbeard and Lucy begin MAKING OUT.  EMMET
48) 16) text: Gosh, where are my manners? Emmet, this is Neckbeard, my boyfriend. Neckbeard, this is Emmet. We used to date a million zillion years ago. It meant nothing to me. You have heard of Vitruvius, of course.  NECKBEARD
48) 19) text: Farrr be it for a pirate to judge a man with an unsavory reputation.  EMMET
48) 21) text: Suddenly, Neckbeard somehow gets up in Emmet's grill.  NECKBEARD
48) 22) text: Stay away from me lady.  EMMET
48) 24) text: Say that to my face.  EMMET
48) 26) text: He gets somehow closer to Emmet. Mouths almost touching.  NECKBEARD
48) 27) text: I was once the most feared MasterBuilder in all the lands. I lost the rest of me body fighting off a hundred of the Black Falcon's men. You cross me, and I'll make it an even fight, if you follow.  EMMET
48) 29) text: Neckbeard slowly hops back past, eyeing Emmet the whole time. Emmet looks to Lucy: "How can you be with him?"  LUCY
48) 32) text: As they board the ship and meet the ragtag crew including Chewbacca, the BAD COP from 20 pages ago watches them from the dock, comparing Emmet to his WANTED POSTER. 48.  
50) 1) text: Neckbeard pores over a chart explaining their heading to Lucy and Vitruvius. Emmet swabs the deck.  NECKBEARD
50) 2) text: The route be stuffed to the gills with Empura shipping activity. It's heavily patrolled. We'll have to be keeping an eye open, and when the time be right, make ourrrr move.  EMMET
51) 1) text: The boat rocks back and forth. Emmet, LITERALLY GREEN, approaches Vitruvius who's MEDITATING while building a crazy mecha bird. Like those adorable creatures in Batteries Not Included.  VITRUVIUS
51) 2) text: Lucy. Welcome.  EMMET
51) 3) text: It's Emmet.  VITRUVIUS
51) 4) text: Ah. You got your sea legs, yet?  EMMET
51) 6) text: Making.  EMMET
51) 8) text: What is anything for? It's what we were all meant to do. What the Maker has fated us to do.  EMMET
51) 10) text: Vitruvius punches Emmet in the face.  EMMET
51) 12) text: The Maker fated me to.  EMMET
51) 15) text: Emmet stares at him for a minute, confused. Then he looks at the mecha-bird, impressed.  EMMET
51) 18) text: Emmet pets the mechabird with a real sense of wonder.  VITRUVIUS
51) 20) text: It emits a PIERCING ALARM CLOCK NOISE.  EMMET
51) 22) text: Open your throat and make a  sound.  EMMET
51) 25) text: How can I teach you something you already know? It's already inside you. You've walled it up, but it still shines through. That terrific disaster you caused at the instruction site? That was no accident.  EMMET
51) 28) text: They say every night the Maker puts a blanket over the world, a blanket with tiny holes. Some call them stars, but I call them MakerPeepers.  EMMET
51) 30) text: MakerPeepers. Emmet, there was a time, before you were born, when making new things came as naturally to everyone as breathing. The world was messy and wild, and that made it beautiful. But then, everything became rigid and prefabricated, so everyone just stopped thinking of new things. Making has been outsourced to Empura. The Black Falcon has paved over the world that was. 
51) 33) text: The mechabird flies out a porthole. Emmet runs after it. 51.   EMMET
54) 3) text: Vitruvius and Emmet come up from below decks. Lucy and Neckbeard begin to meditate together. 
54) 4) text: We go into LUCY'S MIND'S EYE: She is conceiving of new instructions. She can see every piece at once and is reforming them in her mind into something new. NECKBEARD'S MINDS EYE looks the same. Their two visions of the pieces combine!  EMMET
54) 10) text: Neckbeard's pirate crewmembers, including Chewbacca, enthusiastically oblige.  EMMET
54) 13) text: Put the four-piece over there. No! The skinny one. Come on!  EMMET
54) 15) text: Build a hatch.  EMMET
54) 19) text: Emmet, exasperated, does his best to build a hatch. INTERCUT the others building quick and cool with Emmet unable to act creatively at all. Finally, in SLOW MOTION: Emmet puts two bricks together. 
54) 20) text: At the last second, Lucy runs up to Emmet. All he's got is two pieces attached in a cross-bar.  LUCY
54) 21) text: That's as far as you got?!  EMMET
64) 1) text: They did it! Emmet cheers with everyone, excited to be one of the guys. Lucy puts a hand on his shoulder. It's the first time anyone has really touched him since his mom was kidnapped. He smiles and looks out a porthole.  
64) 3) text: Emmet looks out at the water. He sees many beautiful LEGO fish, dolphins, and whales. It's just WONDEROUS.  
65) 1) text: Emmet turns back to the group.  EMMET
65) 3) text: He sees Lucy and Neckbeard making out again. When we cut back to Emmet, he's GREEN again.  
66) 1) text: FOG. The sub surfaces. The hatch opens. Emmet runs out and WRETCHES into the ocean. Until he looks up to find: 55.  
66) 2) text: A TREASURE CHEST floating by. He hauls it onto the deck. Opens it to find what you and I would call a KEYRING with a LASER POINTER. Emmet touches the ring.  EMMET'S VISION: 
66) 19) text: EMMET WAKES UP! He drops the ring in shock. Then he puts it in his purse-backpack. 
68) 1) text: It's so creative - different from the other architecture we've seen. Our heroes knock on the big wacky door.  EMMET
68) 5) text: Who goes there?  EMMET
68) 6) text: Oh, uh, I'm Emmet. This is my ex- girlfriend Lucy, also a blind man, a pirate head, and a loud dog. We're here to save the world.  DOOR FACE
69) 3) text: Hi! I'm Karl, and Welcome to my Krazy Kastle. Krazy with a K!  EMMET
69) 5) text: Exaktly!  EMMET
69) 12) text: If you can conceive it, we will achieve it. Build anything whenever you feel it.  EMMET
72) 2) text: Make any idea thought or spoken. Rules were meant to be broken! 59.   EMMET
73) 3) text: The finish. Emmet is pretty overwhelmed.  EMMET
73) 5) text: Cool, man, thank you.  EMMET
73) 9) text: Emmet. He doesn't get out much. 
73) 10) text: Vitruvius pulls a frustrated Emmet aside.  VITRUVIUS
73) 11) text: Emmet, these people are not MasterBuilders. They do not create with purpose, they create just to create. But they can also be very inspiring, because the only way to accomplish the impossible is to break the rules of what is possible.  EMMET
74) 3) text: Neckbeard hops onto the table and gorges himself. Also, we should mention that everything Neckbeard eats or drinks goes right down his throat and onto the floor. Yuck. Emmet gives Lucy a look. After a beat:  KING KARL
74) 7) text: He waits for them to be impressed, then steps back.  EMMET
74) 17) text: I'm also a MasterBuilder.  EMMET
74) 20) text: He points out the window to an odd, unstable-looking SPACESHIP, which is parked outside.  EMMET
74) 36) text: BEAT. He looks so sad and lonely.  EMMET
74) 38) text: Oh, I'm a Space Cadet. First Class.  EMMET
74) 40) text: We are all that remain of the once proud society of MasterBuilders. Except for Duplo. And Emmet. He's not a MasterBuilder, he's just the son of one. And Lucy, who is still an intern.  BATMAN (INTRIGUED)
74) 43) text: Emmet pulls out the MasterPiece. They all marvel at it.  VITRUVIUS
74) 52) text: They all struggle but the Ninjavikes are too much.  EMMET
75) 26) text: Emmet!  EMMET
76) 2) text: He kicks open the door and smashes Bad Cop's hand in it. He does some creative building and kicks everyone's butts. He frees our heroes.  EMMET
80) 8) text: You have to go.  EMMET
80) 14) text: Beat.  EMMET
80) 21) text: IN MID AIR all the MasterBuilders mind-meld and quickbuild a ROCKET-COPTER around themselves with the remains of the spaceship. Emmet actually helps. He may be getting the hang of this. As they chopper-rocket off:  EMMET
80) 23) text: That's far more impressive than this entire Rocket-Copter.  EMMET
80) 27) text: We see R2D2 in the backseat. 70.   R2D2 &lt; WHISTLES &gt;  EMMET
80) 30) text: FIGHTER JETS PILOTED BY SKELETONS bear down on them! A really awesome DOGFIGHT ensues. Benny pilots, with Batman backseat driving, and Emmet manning the turrets.  BENNY
82) 1) text: The Rocket-Copter crashes into the ground and breaks apart.  EMMET
83) 2) text: But Emmet can't sleep. He stares off at the volcano- tower where his mom is being held. Lucy approaches.  LUCY
83) 3) text: What's up?  EMMET
83) 5) text: Upset about what?  EMMET
83) 9) text: We'll find her.  EMMET
83) 11) text: I know it. I know you.  EMMET
83) 13) text: You don't.  EMMET
83) 15) text: I'm just trying to help. 72.   EMMET
83) 17) text: What?  EMMET
83) 19) text: Lucy LAUGHS.  EMMET
83) 21) text: You may not have a creative bone in your body, but you have a lot of really really earnest bones. You always did.  EMMET
83) 23) text: I mean, that day when we were kids, and you drew the face in art class, you inspired me. I thought maybe there was more out there in the world, and maybe you felt the same. That's why I asked you out. But then you ended up like everyone else and broke my heart, you know? That I was going one way and you didn't go with me.  EMMET
83) 25) text: We're being so dramatic. It was eighth grade!  EMMET
83) 27) text: It made a lot of us dingalings.  EMMET
83) 29) text: Emmet looks away, sad.  LUCY
83) 31) text: She pulls out a wadded-up metallic GUM WRAPPER.  EMMET
83) 34) text: He stares at it, then at her.  EMMET
83) 37) text: Well, good night.  EMMET
83) 39) text: Emmet sits alone, looking at his sparkly reflection in the gum wrapper. As he puts his hands on it:   EMMET'S VISION: 
83) 50) text: Emmet looks at the gum wrapper. Confused, he puts the wrapper in his purse/backpack. He is startled by:  VITRUVIUS
83) 51) text: I don't suppose this is the restroom?  EMMET
83) 54) text: Visions of the Maker. Quite unusual.  EMMET
83) 56) text: We all have a fate. But MasterBuilding is about channeling the power of the Maker, and taking that fate into our own hands. I guess it could mean what you choose to make it mean. 75.   EMMET
83) 59) text: Emmet builds himself a little mecha-bird, like the one that Vitruvius made earlier. It's adorable.  EMMET
83) 63) text: Not bad. You're learning now.  EMMET
83) 66) text: He pats him on the head and walks away. After a beat:  EMMET
84) 4) text: How the heck are we going to do this? 76.   EMMET
84) 6) text: Really?  EMMET
84) 9) text: R2D2 projects the blueprints for the fortress.  EMMET
84) 42) text: We don't have time for that.  EMMET
88) 1) text: The office we saw earlier. 80.   EMMET
88) 4) text: Emmet. 
88) 5) text: She motions to an "IDEAS" notebook. There is nothing in there. There's also a picture of the BF's middle school class photo with Doris in it. The BF has drawn a funny moustache on her. Emmet smashes the picture in anger.  NECKBEARD
88) 18) text: Emmet's heart breaks.  EMMET
88) 28) text: Lucy starts to exit.  EMMET
88) 30) text: Emmet grabs some nearby tubes and goes to work. He's not a quickbuilder, he's more methodical. What's he up to?  
89) 1) text: Emmet places a FOUR-WAY PERISCOPE in front of their faces.  EMMET
89) 3) text: They smile at one another. Emmet smiles. Lucy looks at him. That's the guy she used to love.  
91) 6) text: Emmet rushes up into the Think Tank and finds his MOM. Everything else slows down. The sounds of the fighting fall away. He's so glad to see her. Wouldn't you be?  EMMET
91) 8) text: What? Emmet?  EMMET
92) 1) text: Our heroes book it. Emmet helps Doris.  LUCY
92) 12) text: Lucy stops, frozen...with INDECISION! She looks at Emmet. Emmet smiles bravely at her as he runs.  LUCY
92) 16) text: Bad Cop et al reload.  EMMET
92) 18) text: Fling! Doris is wrapped up.  EMMET
92) 20) text: Fling! Emmet is wrapped up, with the MasterPiece still in his hands. 86.   DORIS
92) 25) text: Batman, Benny, Neckbeard and R2D2 run around the corner. Bad Cop has rounded up Lucy, Emmet, and Doris.  BAD COP (TO ROBO-SOLDIERS)
93) 1) text: Now Emmet, Doris, Lucy and Vitruvius are all tied up in a row facing the window. The Black Falcon inspects his prisoners. 
93) 3) text: He takes the MasterPiece out of Emmet's hands. 
93) 7) text: This stings. He is not nice.  EMMET
93) 9) text: I know sweetie.  EMMET
93) 11) text: I wish I could, son.  EMMET
93) 13) text: I wanted you to be safe. I thought you would be happier. When I saw you with that funny drawing, it was so marvelous. And then I thought of what your life would be, how everyone would treat you. I just couldn't let that happen.  EMMET
96) 1) text: When we look below, we see all the lands we have visited, each walled silos apart from one another. Like the neurons in Emmet's brain at the start of the movie. 
97) 1) text: Inside it's an enormous indoor INSTRUCTION SITE filled with instruction workers working on something big. The Black Falcon's office penthouse is one of the top pegs, looking over everything like a control tower. Emmet notices his instruction worker pals from Act I.  EMMET
104) 1) text: Emmet's house. SMASH! The SKT2's foot smashes down. Pan up to show it about to freeze Emmet's hometown.  
105) 3) text: What is? Describe it to me. I feel really really left out!  EMMET
105) 5) text: Emmet looks around, and eyes the MasterPiece, sitting on the console as a paperweight. Next to it is the MAGNIFYING GLASS on the Black Falcon's desk that he used like 70 pages ago. Emmet gets an idea.  
108) 7) text: The crazy MECHA-BIRD that Emmet built lands nearby.  LARRY
108) 13) text: WE ZOOM INTO LARRY'S BRAIN! The same thing that happened to Emmet. Synapses fire. He gets.... An IDEA! 
109) 7) text: While the Black Falcon is distracted, Emmet slowly hops over to the desk and bumps it, jostling the magnifying glass half over the edge of the desk. He shimmies under it. The magnifying glass lens concentrates the light and starts to BURN away the rubber band binding him up.  BLACK FALCON
109) 10) text: The Black Falcon goes back to barking orders. Meanwhile, the rubber band is almost burned through. Emmet struggles to move himself closer and BURNS his hand.  EMMET (SOTTO)
109) 12) text: And he's free! Yes! Behind BF's back, he frees his mom and hands her the MasterPiece.  EMMET (SOTTO)
109) 16) text: She's too weak. You have to do it.  EMMET
109) 18) text: Emmet unties Lucy. 95.   LUCY
109) 19) text: I believe in you, Emmet. I was mad because you disappointed me for a while, but since it wasn't your fault, I'm willing to give you a mulligan on it.  EMMET
109) 21) text: A mulligan. It's from golf.  EMMET
109) 23) text: The point is, you've spent your whole life wanting to fit in and have friends, by pretending to be something you're not. But now that you've let the real you shine through, you've made some friends who like you for who you are. And even if they're just a crazy spaceman and a pirate head and a blind man and an intern--  EMMET
109) 25) text: I do.  EMMET
109) 27) text: ...Sure.  EMMET
109) 30) text: Emmet looks down on it. Then down on his arm. The BURN MARK from just a minute a go is in the shape of a STAR.  EMMET
109) 32) text: Emmet's eyes roll back. He can suddenly "see" the pieces, like we've seen other MasterBuilders do. But in a way that's even cooler than how they did. He smiles. 
109) 37) text: What is it, Emmet?  EMMET
109) 41) text: Emmet slowly walks towards it, and light from the portal swells, enveloping Emmet completely. He DISAPPEARS! And the portal with it!  BLACK FALCON
113) 1) text: Surrounded by laserbeams, Emmet is levitated through the universe. He is split into pieces - like he is becoming one with the fabric of the universe. He is traveling between the seams. Eventually rising straight towards the brightest star in the sky. 
113) 2) text: The closer we get, we realize that it is not a star at all, but a HOLE in the fabric of the universe. A hole just barely big enough for Emmet to fit through. Well, not quite big enough. He is stuck. 99.  
114) 1) text: Emmet finally wiggles through a hole in a black piece of FELT FABRIC. He rubs his eyes and sees an entire human- sized basement in a LIVE ACTION WORLD. It's like nothing Emmet has ever seen before. 
114) 2) text: He marvels at a coffee cup with pencils in it. Stares at his reflection in a snowglobe.  EMMET
114) 5) text: AN ENTIRE LEGO UNIVERSE laid out below. It's a more mundane version of Emmet's world: the lands are not as vast, towers not as tall, but it's all there: representations of the city, waterfall, space cube, etc. Each area separated by walls - backdrops laid down by a collector. It's pretty much the coolest collection of LEGO sets anyone could ever hope to build. 
114) 6) text: He looks at his feet and sees tons of loose LEGO parts. He realizes he's standing in the middle of a bin of LEFTOVER LEGO pieces.  EMMET
114) 8) text: He looks up to see TED, a human being, staring at him. EMMET TED
114) 10) text: Emmet runs! Ted tries to brush Emmet away, causing a pen knife to fall on Ted's hand. EMMET TED
114) 13) text: - Emmet grabs a cocktail toothpick and parries Ted's flyswatter. 
114) 14) text: - Emmet jumps on Ted and Ted tries to get him off. Emmet clings to Ted's Ear, screaming into it. 
114) 15) text: - Emmet punches Ted in the face while Ted swings and misses Emmet because he is so small.  TED
114) 16) text: What the heck are you?! 100.   EMMET
114) 18) text: I'm a person.  EMMET
114) 21) text: Ted touches Emmet's face. Emmet touches Ted's face. They do a version of the mirror bit from Duck Soup.  EMMET
114) 23) text: Emmet puts his hand up Ted's nose.  EMMET
114) 25) text: Ted sneezes all over Emmet.  EMMET
114) 28) text: Emmet looks back towards the LEGO set. It's all messed up from the fighting.  EMMET
114) 30) text: Yeah, but it's seriously messed up.  EMMET
114) 38) text: Yeah.  EMMET
114) 44) text: The what?  EMMET
114) 47) text: He gestures to a big box of Krazy Glue tubes. Emmet GASPS in horror.  EMMET
114) 49) text: What? I'm using this to glue my set together. So it won't get messed up by the kid.  EMMET
114) 53) text: I can't find a job that doesn't make me hate myself. My girlfriend dumped me for a rich trustafarian... dingaling, is what he is, and I'm watching my sister's kid while she has a fun time partying in the Hamptons with her annoying brood of hot girlfriends who won't have a thing to do with me, and the only thing I have in my life that makes any sense, that I have any control over is that perfect world right there.  EMMET
114) 55) text: See. No. That's not true- because with others, they don't see things the same way, so--  EMMET
114) 57) text: What else could I have?  EMMET
114) 59) text: Ted looks at Finn. Then at Emmet. Then at his glue. He gets something and hands it to Emmet. It's a GLUE CAP.  TED
114) 60) text: Use this.  EMMET
114) 66) text: Yeah. Try that.  EMMET
114) 68) text: Nice to meet you.  EMMET
114) 70) text: Emmet turns and goes back through the makerpeeper hole, back through the portal. Ted picks up a bottle of Krazy Glue-dissolving MINERAL SPIRITS and turns to Finn.  TED
115) 1) text: Emmet careens through the laser tunnel towards LEGOPOLIS. Like a meteor reentering the Earth's atmosphere.  
116) 1) text: Emmet hits the ground, making a LEGO crater. He raises the Cone of Power and dashes toward the SKT2. 
116) 4) text: Well, those guys jump out and form a ground army of ROBO- VIKINGS and SKELETONS and such! Emmet charges for them, seriously outmanned. 
116) 5) text: Leading the charge is Bad Cop in his Police-Spaceship. He has Emmet in his sights... He closes in, firing his blasters, when he looks up for a minute to see...  BENNY
116) 7) text: Benny's ship, headed straight for him! Benny, Neckbeard, Batman and R2D2 dive out just before their ship CRASHES into Bad Cop's, BREAKING HIM AND HIS SHIP TO PIECES! Benny et al land safely, right next to Emmet.  EMMET
116) 10) text: Emmet and the gang quickbuild-fight against the army. Neckbeard headbutts a row of skeletons- they fall like dominoes. Batman uses his Batarang to pop off the heads of a row of Robo-Vikings. But the badguy spaceships are still circling and shooting.  BATMAN
116) 26) text: Even King Karl flies in on his dino-rocket and joins the air battle as the land battle wages on.  ON EMMET 
116) 27) text: Amid the massive battle on air and land, Emmet makes his way through the armies to the SuperKragleThingy2... 
116) 31) text: He flips a switch and the SKT2 extends a mecha-arm, launching a huge MISSILE right towards Emmet!  
117) 1) text: Amidst the air battle, Doris looks out the window to see Emmet on the ground, about to be hit by the missile.  DORIS
117) 2) text: Emmet! 
118) 1) text: Doris gathers her strength in mid-air. Starts building a protective shield to cover her and Emmet. Can she do it? 
118) 4) text: Doris attacks the baddies with heretofore unseen ferocity. She breaks apart streetlamps and makes weapons. A mother protecting her son. She's like a whirling, quickbuilding kung-fu superstar. She is the best fighter in the universe.  EMMET
118) 6) text: I'm the Chosen One, remember?  EMMET
118) 9) text: I was wrong, Emmet. (BAM!) All this time I was trying to keep you from getting hurt, so I told you not to make waves. (POW!) I'm just so glad that I get to see the beautiful waves you finally get to make.(SOCKO!)  EMMET
118) 13) text: The SKT2 takes in a big inhale, about to freeze them... When in lands the most colorful and whimsical SUPERROBOT ever. Exactly opposite of the SKT2. It's made up of all the ships that the citizens of LEGOPOLIS have built. This is WHIMSYBOT, and LUCY's is in the center.  EMMET
118) 17) text: This gives Emmet and Doris a clear pathway to climb on to the SKT2 and scramble up to the cockpit where the Black Falcon is. Doris rips open the cockpit with her bare hands. She jumps in and kicks the Black Falcon's ass.  DORIS
118) 18) text: Emmet, now's your chance! 
118) 19) text: Emmet scrambles to the SKT2's mouth, holding the Cone of Power at the Kragle. But at the last second, his route is cut off by the BLACK FALCON, holding Doris hostage. 
118) 21) text: EMMET GETS AN IDEA - we see this as we have before.  EMMET
118) 23) text: And he runs away... or does he? No! He runs around the back of the SKT2 and tunnels in through the back of its head! He lifts the CONE OF POWER!  EMMET
118) 29) text: A beat. Then the whole SKT2 EXPLODES into a million LEGO pieces! Emmet and Doris and The Black Falcon are thrown high into the air. 
118) 31) text: DOWN IN LEGOPOLOIS, everyone GASPS. It seems the SKT2 explosion killed Emmet and Doris. 
118) 32) text: That's when two enormous five-fingered LEGO clouds shaped like hands, one grown up one, one kid one, enter the frame from above. THE HANDS OF THE MAKER(s). They catch Emmet and Doris in midair, and put them together safely on the ground. 
118) 33) text: Emmet holds the original Kragle tube, and gives it back to the Cloud Hands, which take it up in the sky in a marvelous light show. Think the Abyss, or Close Encounters. Everyone stares at it, admiring the artistry. The lights shines in their faces.  
123) 2) text: What the heck just happened?  EMMET
123) 4) text: Emmet hugs Lucy and they KISS as well as a minifig can. Meanwhile, Neckbeard and Doris check each other out a little.  NECKBEARD (WINKING)
