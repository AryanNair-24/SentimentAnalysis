5) 5) dialog: Something like that. But I think this weekend I’m going to earn a little extra credit. (smiles) We’re going to go to that new water- park, out on 66. Then...

Alma nods, but Dylan doesn’t leave; there is some electricity in the air between them: DYLAN (CONT’D) Listen, detective Varg... Alma.

44) 12) dialog: What would you do, Bradley? I’m sick of you telling us what we don’t know, without giving us anything we can actually use -- For all we know you’re the Fifth Horseman.
44) 19) dialog: You know what I don’t buy? Your motives. You told us you want to be relevant- but what you are is hated. You break the code of your own kind every day, and for what? A few bucks, fifteen minutes of fame? Don’t you have any sense of honor? 65.

50) 34) dialog: There is, however, one thing we do know with certainty -- The only way to breach a facility like that is with someone on the inside. We want the names of the employees you sent money to, and we want them now.

Arms wide. Do it. They do it. Dylan kneels down and pulls their caps off- looks at their faces- JUST THREE TOUGH LOOKING GUYS WE’VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. Agent Fuller rushes over, breathing hard:

Michael turns to RODERIGO, who pulls a lever, and a DOZEN HUGE SCREENS descend around Michael, seeming to hover in air -- RODERIGO takes out a HANDHELD VIDEO CAMERA, points at the screens, and THE SCREENS SUDDENLY FILL with an IMAGE OF THE MONEY FACT moving through it, as if filmed by RODERIGO’S CAMERA as h paces the stage. MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D) Some of these places- like this one- can hold nearly a billion dollars at any given time. Can you believe that? ANGLE ON DYLAN AND ALMA -- Looking at each other; how do these quys do this? MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D) And here it is, the room where all that money is held. And there it is, in that glass covered pallet. Newly printed. Almost One. Billion. Dollars. THE AUDIENCE falls into a hush, hardly breathing, at the image of the CAGED ROOM HOLDING THE MONEY on the SCREENS. MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D) The government prints it, just like that, whenever they want to. But I think, for once, someone else should decide where it goes, don’t you? THE CROWD ANSWERS WITH AN UPROARIOUS AFFIRMATIVE. 99. MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D) Alright, then. So, with a single snap of the fingers- Michael turns to the screens- SNAPS. Nothing happens. A beat. Michael turns and shoots a look at Roderigo- who shakes h head, with a look that says: “I don’t know what the hell going on.” MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D) This is a really hard one. SNAPS his finger again. Again nothing. Michael waits another moment. Then, recomposing himself, turns back to audience: MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D) Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like you’re not going to get the finale you were expecting tonight. THE BIGGEST BOO YOU’VE EVER HEARD IN YOUR LIFE. DURING THE CACOPHONY EYE-CONTACT passes between MICHAEL A DYLAN, MICHAEL AND ALMA, MICHAEL AND THADDEUS... various degrees of gloating in their eyes, a tinge of defeat in h then MICHAEL raises his hands, trying to quiet down the crowd: MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D) Is this really why you’re here?
