London turns and gives the audience a cheeky look; SNAPS FINGERS, and suddenly the volunteers are fumbling and surprised, the EGGS LANDING EVERYWHERE, splattering on th heads, on the floor, as the audience is convulsed with

But this is the biggest audience we’ve had... there’s a lot of you out there. That means we have to come up with our biggest score yet. And money doesn’t grow on trees... (pauses) But it is printed in factories. Michael turns to RODERIGO, who pulls a lever, and a DOZEN HUGE SCREENS descend around Michael, seeming to hover in air -- RODERIGO takes out a HANDHELD VIDEO CAMERA, points at the screens, and THE SCREENS SUDDENLY FILL with an IMAGE OF THE MONEY FACT moving through it, as if filmed by RODERIGO’S CAMERA as h paces the stage.

Michael turns and shoots a look at Roderigo- who shakes h head, with a look that says: “I don’t know what the hell going on.” MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D) This is a really hard one. SNAPS his finger again. Again nothing. Michael waits another moment. Then, recomposing himself, turns back to audience: MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D) Ladies and gentlemen, it looks like you’re not going to get the finale you were expecting tonight. THE BIGGEST BOO YOU’VE EVER HEARD IN YOUR LIFE. DURING THE CACOPHONY EYE-CONTACT passes between MICHAEL A DYLAN, MICHAEL AND ALMA, MICHAEL AND THADDEUS... various degrees of gloating in their eyes, a tinge of defeat in h then MICHAEL raises his hands, trying to quiet down the crowd: MICHAEL ATLAS (CONT’D) Is this really why you’re here? For the money? Are you becoming the very people you disdain? The people you come to see us humiliate? Aren’t there more important things in life- like Love. .?
