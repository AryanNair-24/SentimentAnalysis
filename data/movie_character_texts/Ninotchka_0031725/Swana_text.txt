0) 362) dialog: Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
0) 364) dialog: Don't tell me the bed has lost its  best friend.
0) 366) dialog: Darling, you're taking my business  affairs far too seriously. Much as  I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of  their filthy money, I won't do it at  the expense of your health.  Particularly as we know we won't get  much. (tenderly) You look so pale... pale but  interesting.
0) 368) dialog: Come in.
0) 372) dialog: Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds  and make yourself agreeable to the  Whites if you don't keep up your  strength.
0) 375) dialog: Not in your condition. (to Gaston) Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and  tender. And lay out his gray suit. (to Leon) Afterwards I'll drive you through  the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
0) 377) dialog: Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a  striped one, and brighten it with a  great blaze of tie.

0) 380) dialog: Now... here we have two very handsome  soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose  hens mind what happens to their eggs?  Probably not. They have such unfeeling  eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of  butter, plenty of pepper and salt...  Darling, I haven't seen you for three  livelong days... seventy-two hours!
0) 382) dialog: You haven't seen her yet?
0) 384) dialog: That proletarian! In the old days  we'd have had her flogged.
0) 386) dialog: You just told me you hadn't seen  her.
0) 388) dialog: Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by  the boots of a muzhik! What does she  look like?
0) 390) dialog: That bad? (Leon nods) Old or young?
0) 392) dialog: You saw all that in one glimpse?

0) 451) dialog: I'm leaving, dear. I'm lunching at  Fouquet's if you can make it, and...  Leon, remember, a man should think  it over twice before he decides to  become a mother.
0) 692) dialog: Good evening, Louis. You seem to be  very crowded tonight. Can you manage  a table near the floor?
0) 694) dialog: (puzzled) Count d'Algout...

0) 697) dialog: No, that's another party.
0) 700) dialog: (delighted at her  luck) No, no! This is glory! At last I'm  going to have a look at that female  Bolshevik. Can you give us another  table?
0) 702) dialog: That's perfect!
0) 705) dialog: Isn't it divine?
0) 707) dialog: (very gay, in  anticipation of a  triumph) Now, we must be very discreet. If  she sucks her soup and drinks out of  her finger bowl, I don't want anyone  to laugh. (everybody in the  party giggles) We must not embarrass little Leon.  He is going through enough for my  sake. We mustn't add insult to injury
0) 710) dialog: Thank you, Louis.
0) 711) text: They sit down. The Headwaiter bends over General Savitzky an elderly Russian aristocrat, who sits next to Swana.
0) 714) dialog: (to the party) I'm only afraid that the doorman may  spoil our fun. If only he lets her  in!

0) 721) dialog: General, please... if you hear any  rumors that I am a charitable person,  will you please kill them at their  source?

0) 755) dialog: (to Leon) You're looking magnificent, Leon... (to General Savitzky) ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
0) 757) text: Leon knows that Swana wants to embarrass him but is  embarrassed nevertheless.

0) 765) dialog: (forcing an  introduction) Am I interrupting?
0) 767) dialog: How do you do?
0) 772) dialog: I've some wonderful news for you,  Leon. It's about Punchy... do you  mind if I sit down?
0) 774) text: Swana sits down.
0) 775) dialog: (to General Savitzky) General, would you mind making my  excuses at our table? I'll be back  in a few moments.
0) 779) dialog: Well, Leon, we can be proud of our  Punchy. He had a triumph at the dog  show.
0) 780) text: During the following speech, Ninotchka's expression does change. She knows exactly the game Swana is playing.
0) 781) dialog: (continuing) He won another blue ribbon and bit  the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him  the cutest sweater as a reward. You  should see him strut down the street  in it. He looks like a little  boulevardier. (to Ninotchka) You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy  for my birthday. (to Leon) You must have searched weeks before  you found anything as divine as  Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
0) 783) dialog: (to Ninotchka) Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are  talking in mysteries.... I'm sure  you wonder what it's all about.
0) 785) dialog: Dear me... I must be losing my  finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be  understood by everybody.
0) 787) dialog: I'm going, Leon... (she rises, as does  Leon, delighted to  get rid of her) but before I leave I must compliment  you on your gown, Madame Yakushova.  Is that what they're wearing in Moscow  this year?
0) 789) text: Swana sits again, as does Leon.
0) 790) dialog: Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong  impression of the new Russia. (cynically) It must be charming. I'm glad  conditions are so improved. I assume  this is what the factory workers  wear at their dances?
0) 792) dialog: You're absolutely right about the  Cossacks. We made an unpardonable  mistake when we let them use their  knouts. They had such reliable guns.
0) 795) dialog: A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm  afraid madame and I will never agree. (she plays her trump  card) The only thing we have in common is  our lawsuit and that will be decided  next week. I understand everything  will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
0) 798) dialog: (rubbing it in) It is unfortunate that you have so  few more days in Paris. (she turns to Leon) Be sure and redouble your efforts so  that madame can take some pleasant  memories when she returns to Moscow. (she rises, Leon rising  too) Good night. (Ninotchka nods without  answering. To Leon) Good night, Leon.

0) 938) dialog: (ironically) Good morning.
0) 940) dialog: It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow  noon, to be exact. I hope you will  forgive me. I know it's extremely  cruel to waken anyone at such an  hour. Don't you recognize me? I am  the Duchess Swana.
0) 941) text: By now Ninotchka is awake. She gets up and realizes to he acute embarrassment the condition in which Swana has foun her.
0) 942) dialog: I know how you feel, my dear. The  morning after always does look grim  if you happen to be wearing last  night's dress. Don't be embarrassed  by my presence, though. You couldn't  have found anybody more sympathetic  to your condition. I remember once  in Petrograd when I felt exactly as  you do. I had to bow from a balcony  to the crowd. My dear, the masses  have no understanding of the feelings  of a lady before noon. Don't you  find that true?
0) 943) text: During Swana's speech Ninotchka has found herself complet
0) 945) dialog: Of course not, my dear! I didn't  come here with any such suspicion.  How ridiculous! (with a glance toward  the living room) Nor did I come here to pick up his  hat.
0) 948) dialog: (as she reaches the  threshold) How stale last night's gaiety looks!  It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
0) 950) dialog: Don't worry, you were quite rude  enough. (during the following  speech, she draws  the curtains and  opens the windows) Do you mind if I let in a little  fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it  will make you feel better and I want  you to be at your very best. In full  possession of your faculties, at  least.
0) 952) dialog: I just dropped in to have a little  heart-to-heart talk with you.
0) 954) dialog: Now there you are completely wrong.  If we sit down for a little chat,  I'm sure we won't run out of  conversation and what's more it won't  be dull.
0) 956) dialog: That's all right... I grow on people.
0) 958) dialog: Leave? That's exactly what I came  here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't  mean this hotel and I don't mean  Paris... I mean France. There's a  plane for Moscow at five-forty.
0) 960) dialog: Don't worry. I have already made  reservations. It's perfect flying  weather. They assure me there's a  fine tail wind which will sweep you  back to Moscow in no time.
0) 962) text: Ninotchka's words for the first time sting Swana out of h apparently superficial attitude.
0) 963) dialog: (bitterly) My palace in Petrograd... yes, you  took that away from me. You took  away my czar, my country, my people,  everything I had... (with emphasis) but nothing more -- I warn you.
0) 965) dialog: Very interesting, my dear, but  couldn't you write all that from  Moscow? A dissertation on love on  Soviet stationery -- would be an  amusing paradox.
0) 967) dialog: My dear, you don't know how impressive  I could be. Did you ever see me in  my regalia with my diadem and all my  jewels?
0) 970) dialog: You can't deny we gave the people  their money's worth -- almost --  eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
0) 972) dialog: Not before you agree to use those  reservations to Moscow.
0) 977) text: LONG SHOT -- NINOTCHKA AT THE TELEPHONE, waiting for her  connection In the background the door to the living room is opened b Swana.
0) 978) dialog: (standing in the door) I wouldn't waken Leon. After last  night I would say not before three  o'clock at the earliest.
0) 980) dialog: Believe me, Leon can't help you. He  doesn't know anything about the  jewels... I give you my word... I  swear it.
0) 981) text: Ninotchka hangs up the receiver and stares at Swana. She  walks toward her. LIVING ROOM, SHOOTING INTO THE BEDROOM. In the foreground Swana, in the background Ninotchka, who is hurrying towar her.
0) 983) dialog: You were very careless with our  precious jewels, my dear. They're  too expensive a toy for two children  to play with.
0) 985) dialog: Don't worry. Fortunately last night  a very trustworthy friend kept his  eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped  his function as a waiter but he  fulfilled his duty as a Russian. (she draws back the  fur scarf she is  wearing, revealing a  diamond star, one of  the jewels we have  seen) I just put this on for sentiment.  The rest are absolutely safe. I assure  you. But if you feel like notifying  the police...
0) 987) dialog: Won't it be rather embarrassing for  a Soviet Envoy to disclose the  circumstances under which she lost  them?
0) 989) dialog: That's very simple to answer. They  were given to me by my mother. They  were given to her by her mother, in  fact they're mine, you cannot steal  what belongs to you!
0) 992) dialog: (triumphantly) I told you we had plenty to talk  about. Shall we sit down?
0) 994) dialog: (very matter-of-fact) Now, let's free ourselves from  emotionalism and try to solve the  problem in a practical way. Our  situation has changed considerably.  Before I had only a claim to the  jewels. Now I have the jewels.
0) 996) dialog: Unfortunately.
0) 998) dialog: My lawyer agrees with you. He says  France will uphold it in every court,  but I will drag you through every  court, don't forget that. And when I  say it will take two years I am, as  always, conservative.
0) 1000) dialog: I may run out of money, but you have  already run out of bread. Two years  is a long time for your comrades to  wait.
0) 1002) dialog: No, I just wanted to be absolutely  impartial. Both of us are faced with  two rather uncomfortable years. We  can condense these two years to two  minutes if you want to accept my  proposition. Ninotchka now realizes  what she is after.
0) 1004) dialog: I am willing to hand over the jewels  and sign the necessary papers if you  take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
0) 1006) dialog: I think I know Leon quite as well as  you... possibly a little better.  Leave that worry to me. Five-forty  leaves you time enough to close the  deal with Monsieur Mercier, but  naturally you'll be too busy for any  farewells. I'll see to it that  everything is done in the most  expeditious manner and I will also  see you to the airport. That's my  proposition, Comrade Yakushova.

0) 1031) dialog: Leon, darling, how nice! Have you  ordered tea or a cocktail?
0) 1033) dialog: Did I act stupidly last night? Should  I apologize?
0) 1035) dialog: Is this, by any chance, going to be  a confession?
0) 1037) dialog: Oh, no, my little Volga boatman.  Have you forgotten our First  Commandment: Never Complain -- Never  Explain. It has worked so often and  so perfectly, don't let's break the  rule. And please don't look so guilty,  otherwise I'll...
0) 1039) dialog: All right, I'll listen.
0) 1041) dialog: Brutal frankness, if you insist.
0) 1043) dialog: And I thought it was something  serious! How could you frighten me  so?
0) 1045) dialog: Say it over and over again, Leon.  Words are a wonderful safety valve,  and that's what you need -- because  you know it's impossible, don't you?
0) 1047) dialog: Leon! This has the ugly sound of  regeneration.
0) 1049) dialog: The same old trouble, Leon. You're  always late. Whether you're taking  me to the Opera or calling for me at  a beauty shop, you're never on time.  And now, when it's a question of  your reform -- late again. (she glances at her  wrist watch) By about five minutes.
0) 1051) dialog: Knowing the efficiency of the French  Air Service I think I can guarantee  that Madame Yakushova has already  taken off for Moscow.

0) 1098) dialog: Hello, Leon darling!
0) 1100) dialog: (suavely) After our talk last night  I took it for granted that you would  drop in here this morning. Knowing  how difficult it is to get into Soviet  Russia, I thought I might be of some  assistance to you. (to the Official) May I introduce myself? I am the  Duchess Swana of Russia... another  Russia.
0) 1103) dialog: (to the Official) Count d'Algout was for several years  my personal representative and if it  is necessary to sign any affidavit  for him I'll be delighted.
0) 1105) dialog: (stopping at the door) Just in case they don't give you  your visa to Russia I want you to  know that I have signed a contract  for my memoirs and rented a lovely  little chГўteau in the Touraine, and  if you feel the need of a change...
