0) 153) dialog: What?
0) 155) dialog: That's funny. It's interesting. I  never gave it a thought before.
0) 157) dialog: Have I? Do you know when I come to  think about it it's staggering. If I  add it all up I must have spent years  waiting for signals. Imagine! An  important part of my life wasted  between whistles.
0) 159) dialog: No.
0) 161) dialog: You're welcome.
0) 163) dialog: Can I help you?
0) 165) dialog: Love to.
0) 167) dialog: (bewildered) Facing north... I'd hate to commit  myself without my compass... Pardon  me... are you an explorer?
0) 169) dialog: Is that thing lost again?... Listen...  if you are interested in a view...
0) 171) dialog: Technical... I couldn't help you  from that angle. You see, a real  Parisian only goes to the top of the  tower in moments of despair to jump  off.
0) 173) dialog: Now, isn't that too bad! The last  time I jumped I forgot to clock it! (looks at map) Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your  finger, please.
0) 176) dialog: Bad manners to point with your own...  Here... the Eiffel Tower.

0) 201) dialog: (continuing) Four massive piers of masonry are  sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on  the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other  side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have  an inclination of fifty-four  degrees...
0) 203) dialog: Yes, very strange.
0) 205) dialog: (continuing to read) Ascending to the tower is a staircase  consisting of eight hundred and twenty- nine steps... (this disclosure  frightens Leon as he  realizes the climb  ahead of him. He  reads on as they  walk up) ...and an additional two hundred and  fifty-four steps to the very top... (now Leon stops but  Ninotchka proceeds  on out of the picture.  Leon calls after her  and reads from his  book in a loud voice) There is an elevator included in the  price of admission!
0) 208) dialog: He looks after Ninotchka, then makes up his mind and retu down the stairs. GROUND FLOOR -- EIFFEL TOWER, shooting toward the elevato door. The elevator with several passengers is just about leave when Leon hurries into it. The door closes and the  elevator starts to ascend quickly.
0) 212) dialog: (looking at the  dazzling view) And thank you for getting me up here.  I've never seen this before.  Beautiful, isn't it?
0) 214) dialog: I'm glad I saw it before becoming  extinct.
0) 216) dialog: You must admit that this doomed old  civilization sparkles... It glitters!
0) 220) dialog: What a city! There are the Grands  Boulevards... blasted out of the  heart of the old streets. The Arc de  Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's  army. The Opera! And Montmartre...  Montparnasse... La BohГЁme... and now  I'll show you the greatest attraction! (he steps to a  telescope and, taking  some money from his  pocket, drops a coin  in the slot) It will cost me a franc but it is  worth it. (he adjusts the  telescope) The most wonderful spot in all Paris --  unique! Here, look.... (she looks in telescope) What do you see?
0) 222) dialog: It's not the structure but the spirit  which dwells within. There are three  rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to  hospitality.
0) 224) dialog: Well, let's say I live in it. Such a  pleasant place... all kinds of  comfort, easy to reach, close to  street car, bus, and subway...

0) 251) text: Leon feels a little uncertain as to how to approach this  creature.
0) 253) dialog: We take off our hat and coat. (he takes her things) We sit down -- we make ourselves  comfortable. We adjust ourselves to  the prospect of a most enjoyable  evening. We look at each other. We  smile. (Ninotchka doesn't  respond) Well... we don't smile. How about  some music?
0) 255) dialog: It helps. It has ever since King  David wooed Bathsheba with the harp.  As I am not so fortunate as to have  my harp at hand, I shall turn on the  radio.
0) 257) dialog: Not too big and not too small. What  I'd call the typical room of an  average man. Or shall we say a little  above average. Now if there are any  special aspects you wish to study I  have nothing to conceal. Just look  around. That's my desk. Those are my  books, and here am I. Where shall we  begin?
0) 259) dialog: That's great. I'm thirty-five years  old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh  a hundred and eighty-two pounds  stripped.
0) 261) dialog: Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind  alert, keeping my landlord appeased.  That's a full-time job.
0) 263) dialog: For mankind not a thing -- for  womankind the record is not quite so  bleak.
0) 265) dialog: Thank you. Thank you.
0) 267) dialog: I begin to believe in it myself since  I've met you. I still don't know  what to make of it. It confuses me,  it frightens me a little, but it  fascinates me, Ninotchka.
0) 269) dialog: Ni-notchka.
0) 271) dialog: Ninotchka, do you like me just a  little bit?
0) 273) dialog: Thank you.
0) 275) dialog: Your cornea is terrific. Tell me --  you're so expert on things -- can it  be that I'm falling in love with  you?
0) 277) dialog: Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
0) 279) dialog: What can I possibly do to encourage  such an impulse in you?
0) 281) dialog: (bewildered, and yet  completely intrigued) You're the most improbable creature  I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka,  Ninotchka...
0) 283) dialog: I'd like to say it a thousand times.
0) 285) dialog: I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must  forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a  poor bourgeois.
0) 287) dialog: (bewildered) The bayonet? Did you really?
0) 289) dialog: Wounded? How?
0) 291) dialog: (dumfounded) I'd love to. (she pulls the blouse  off her shoulder and  shows him her scar) Tsk, tsk, tsk.

0) 296) dialog: What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
0) 298) dialog: You're the most adorable cog I ever  saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska,  let me confess something. Never did  I dream I could feel like this toward  a sergeant.
0) 300) dialog: Do you hear that?
0) 302) dialog: It's midnight. One half of Paris is  making love to the other half. Look  at the clock. One hand has met the  other hand. They kiss. Isn't that  wonderful?
0) 304) dialog: I can't possibly think of a better  reason.
0) 306) dialog: (trying desperately  to make her mood  more romantic) You analyze everything out of  existence. You analyze me out of  existence. I won't let you. Love is  not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka,  why do doves bill and coo? Why do  snails, coldest of all creatures,  circle interminably around each other?  Why do moths fly hundreds of miles  to find their mates? Why do flowers  open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka,  Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight  symptom of the divine passion... a  general warmth in the palms of your  hands... a strange heaviness in your  limbs... a burning of the lips that  is not thirst but a thousand times  more tantalizing, more exalting,  than thirst?
0) 309) text: That is too much for Leon. He takes her into his arms and kisses her.
0) 310) dialog: Was that talkative?
0) 312) text: Leon kisses her again.
0) 314) dialog: Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My  impossible, unromantic, statistical...

0) 320) text: Leon exits out of shot to answer telephone.
0) 322) dialog: (into phone) Hello?... Yes... I'm sorry but I  couldn't make it. I ran into a friend  from the army... What?... The deal  is off! Are you crazy, Buljanoff?...
0) 324) dialog: 
0) 325) dialog: ...A special envoy arrived... What?...  That sounds better. I'll be glad to  see her any time she wants... Oh,  she doesn't want to see me? What do  you know about that? Why?... Well,  I'll get in touch with her myself.  What's her name?... (he takes a pencil  and a piece of paper) ...What?... Yaku... How do you spell  it?... Heavens! those Russian names! (he starts to write  it down) ...I... Oh, Y...
0) 326) text: Camera pulls back and Ninotchka enters the shot. She take pencil from Leon's hand, writes out the name, and leaves  again. At first Leon is not aware of the full significanc of her action. Then it dawns on him.

0) 334) dialog: Ninotchka, or shall I say Special  Envoy Yakushova...
0) 336) dialog: I have a better suggestion. Let's  forget that the telephone ever rang.  I never heard that you are  Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my  Ninotchka...
0) 338) dialog: All right, fight me, fight me as  much as you want, but fight me  tomorrow morning! There's nothing  sweeter than sharing a secret with a  bitter enemy.
0) 340) dialog: Tonight let's not represent anybody  but ourselves.
0) 342) dialog: You know I want to...
0) 344) dialog: (desperate) Ninotchka, you can't walk out like  this... I'm crazy about you, and I  thought I'd made an impression on  you. You liked the white of my eye.
0) 348) dialog: But, Ninotchka, I held you in my  arms. You kissed me!
0) 361) dialog: Huh?
0) 363) dialog: No.
0) 365) dialog: I just couldn't sleep. I got up and  went back... and then got up again.  These last few days... whew!

0) 381) dialog: (irritably) Oh, please, Swana! I don't know  whether I'm standing on my head or  my heels. Here you are blaming me  for neglecting you when I'm trying  to concentrate on another woman and  can't get near her.
0) 383) dialog: No, and believe me I've tried  everything! I must have telephoned  her a hundred times. I've sent her  telegrams, I've sent her flowers...  I asked her to dinner... I offered  her seats for the Opera...
0) 385) dialog: That wouldn't have done any good.  Not with her. (forgetting himself) She's the most incredible creature  I've ever seen.
0) 387) dialog: Well... er... I caught a glimpse of  her when she walked through the lobby.
0) 389) dialog: You can't imagine.
0) 391) dialog: Timeless. When she comes into a room  you'd think that the Bolsheviks had  taken over Paris. She wears her cheap  miserable blouse as though it were  the latest model by Schiaparelli.  What a woman! What a woman! There is  a Russian snowstorm in each of her  eyes.

0) 435) dialog: No, no.

0) 510) text: Leon leans toward Ninotchka with mock humility.
0) 511) dialog: Pardon me for addressing you but you  insulted him, you know that. You  hurt his feelings. It was just like  telling a musician you don't like  music. That good old man believes in  food as you believe in Karl Marx.  You can't go around hurting people,  Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can  make it up to him. Do you know how? (He changes to the  chair at his table  which is closest to  her table) By eating everything with relish, by  drinking everything with gusto, by  having a good time for the first  time in your natural life!

0) 515) dialog: I always eat here.

0) 535) dialog: Must one always be after something?
0) 537) dialog: Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk  business. If you win the suit, fine.  If we win the suit, better. You do  me an injustice. (He moves over to her  table, leaving the  soup at his table) When we went to my apartment did I  have the slightest idea that you had  any connection with this deal?
0) 539) dialog: Death! Death! Always so glum! What  about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians  never think of life? Of the moment  in which we are living? The only  moment we really have? Don't take it  all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing  is worth it. Please... relax... I  beg you, Sergeant... smile!
0) 541) dialog: Will you smile?
0) 543) dialog: Just smile.
0) 545) dialog: At anything. At the whole ludicrous  spectacle of life. At people being  pompous and taking themselves  seriously and exaggerating their own  importance. If you can't find anything  else to laugh at you can laugh at  you and me.
0) 547) dialog: Because we are an odd couple.
0) 549) dialog: No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not  yet. Not until I've made you laugh...  at least once.

McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello,  Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy  says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr.  McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to  McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs.  McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy  says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs.  McIntosh?"...
0) 560) dialog: (disarmed) So do I. (after a little pause) Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha!  Ha! (he looks at Ninotchka  and her expression  stops him) Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's  forget it! How's this? Two men are  looking at the moon. One says to the  other, "Is it true that a lot of  people live on the moon?" "Yes, it  is," says the other, "five hundred  million." "Whew!" replies the first,  "they must get pretty crowded when  it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
0) 562) dialog: (starting to get sore) I suppose you don't think that's  funny?
0) 564) dialog: It seemed funny to me when I first  heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't  with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
0) 566) dialog: Maybe you haven't any sense of humor.  Well, I'll give you one more chance!  Now listen!
0) 568) dialog: When I heard this joke for the first  time I laughed myself sick. Here  goes! A man comes into a restaurant  and sits down and says, "Waiter! Get  me a cup of coffee without cream."  After five minutes the waiter comes  back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we're  all out of cream, can it be without  milk?"
0) 571) dialog: (furious) Not funny, huh?
0) 573) dialog: So you don't think that's funny? It  is funny! Everyone else thinks so!  Maybe you didn't get it.
0) 575) dialog: (threateningly) I'll tell you that joke again. A man  comes into a restaurant. Did you get  that?
0) 577) dialog: He sits down at the table and says  to the waiter... Did you get that  too?
0) 579) dialog: Well, so far it isn't funny, but  wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter!  Bring me a cup of coffee." So the  waiter comes back five minutes later  and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have  no coffee."... (he realizes he has  made a mistake) Wait a minute... wait a minute...  I'm all mixed up... (he starts over again) A man comes in a restaurant, he sits  down, he calls the waiter and he  says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee  without cream," and five minutes  later the waiter comes back and says,  "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream,  can it be a glass of milk!"

0) 627) dialog: And Gaston, I was happier all day  long. I felt I'd contributed  something.
0) 629) dialog: Ah, there's something poetic about  the simple processes of labor.  Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet,  sheet... it should be set to music!
0) 631) dialog: I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it  about time that you realized the  unfairness of your position? You  being my servant? Wouldn't you like  to stand on an equal footing with  me?
0) 633) dialog: Isn't there any revolt in you?  Sometimes when I order you around  don't you feel like kicking me in  the pants?

0) 642) dialog: Foolish? If this dress were to walk  down the boulevard all by itself I  would follow it from one end of Paris  to the other, and when I caught up  with it I would say, "Just a moment,  you charming little dress, I want  you to meet Ninotchka... you two  were meant for each other."
