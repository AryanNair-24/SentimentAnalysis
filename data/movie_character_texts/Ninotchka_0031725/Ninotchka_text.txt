(suddenly getting up) Comrades, I am not in a position to  pass final judgment but at best you  have been careless in your duty to  the State. (with utmost gravity) You were entrusted with more than a  mere sale of jewelry. Why are we  peddling our precious possessions to  the world at this time? Our next  year's crop is in danger and you  know it. Unless we can get foreign  currency to buy tractors there will  not be enough bread for our people.  And you three comrades...
