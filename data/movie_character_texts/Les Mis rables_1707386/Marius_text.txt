The other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette. Th two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from evening church service. Marius can't take his eyes off Cosette. He's never seen anyone so lovely in his life. We hear the instrumental foreshadowing of `A Heart Full of Love'. As if drawn by Marius's gaze, Cosette looks up and meets his eyes. She too is amazed: he's looking at her as if he already knows her. A second carriage breaks their held gaze. Marius continues on down the street and when he looks bac at that precise moment Cosette looks at him again. Valjean instinctively puts his arm round her, guarding he jealously from this distant boy's gaze. We cut further down the street to an alleyway where the Thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for Valjean's approach with their gang of crooks, Babet, Brujon, Clacquesous, Montparnasse.

Bullets fly, and every few moments another cannon ball smashes into the piled debris. Javert is glimpsed among t attackers. Enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the barricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles down to others to be re-loaded, firing again. Valjean moves among them, tending to the wounded, lifting down the dead, regardless of his own safety. Marius takes a bullet, and crumples and falls. Valjean ru towards him - CRASH!

Valjean carries Marius down the tunnel, moving as fast as he can, losing strength all the time. He reaches an intersection where four sewers meet. Light falls through distant gratings. One of the four sewers is dry. Here he lets his burden down, and himself sinks to the slimy grou to rest. He lets his eyes close. A voice echoes in the shadows.
