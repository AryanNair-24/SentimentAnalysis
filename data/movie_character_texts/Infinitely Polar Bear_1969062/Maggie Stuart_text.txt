3) 77) dialog: Don’t worry about Faith. Faith bites. Amelia laughs, then:
3) 79) dialog: And she loves you. She stopped me in the hall and told me... (her voice breaks) She was so sorry. And she would miss you very much. Amelia nods and leans against her mother.
3) 82) dialog: Toothbrushes? Maggie enters from the kitchen with a tray. On it is a teapot and tea cups and buttered toast on a plate. She pu it on the table and pours it out, handing him a cup.

4) 228) dialog: I don’t know what will happen, Cam. I just want to get through this period. Can’t we see how it goes? As he attempts to unbutton her top:
4) 230) dialog: I want you to be the person we all know you can be. It will take steady, sustained effort. You can do it, Cam. If you want to do it. He puts his hand on her breast.
4) 232) dialog: Honest, honest answer. 58.
4) 234) dialog: Don’t think of it like that. You hate tests --
4) 239) dialog: I’m sorry, Cam. I just can’t make promises right now --
4) 241) dialog: Are you taking your lithium?
4) 245) dialog: (delicately) In some ways. He was funny. Compassionate. He knew everything about the outdoors. He had a job, which was good for him. He was a terrific lighting designer. But in the end, it was too much pressure... I didn’t understand about the manic-depression. Besides, everyone was having nervous breakdowns in the 60s, so I didn’t realize what a big deal it was.

5) 84) dialog: You’re a mix of both of us.

5) 87) dialog: Damn it. She throws down the pastry bag. Amelia feels guilty. 82.
5) 89) dialog: You don’t? Amelia shakes her head.
5) 91) dialog: You’ve gotten so old.
5) 94) dialog: I think the last time we were at Legal Seafood, Faith pulled shrimp scampi all over my silk blouse.
5) 96) dialog: It was my best shirt.
5) 98) dialog: (laughing) You were so sad. He nods, laughs. 83.
5) 99) dialog: Amelia told me she doesn’t think she’s black.
5) 101) dialog: She also said they’re not scared anymore. The girls seem to be ina really good place.
5) 103) dialog: Wow.
5) 105) dialog: You seem good too, Cam.
5) 107) dialog: I'll be so happy when I get a job and I’m back here. Thanks for making it possible. Maggie smiles at Cam. He pulls her closer.
5) 109) dialog: Cam, I can’t go in your room.
5) 111) dialog: It’s beyond belief. You have three bicycles in there. Cam looks flabbergasted.
5) 113) dialog: Yes! There are cans of paint thinner -- and the last time I went in there I got motor oil on my skirt. I mean it’s... it’s ridiculous.
5) 115) dialog: That would be nice. It would make it more inviting.
5) 117) dialog: I’m done nagging you to clean your room, you're a grown man and it’s your room.
5) 119) dialog: (amused) No! Not to me or anybody else. Probably not even to you. Cam laughs, good-naturedly.
5) 125) dialog: .-.I’m graduating at the top of my class and I’ve actually been offered a futures job at E.F. Hutton in New York, but Howard and Company is where I want to be.
5) 127) dialog: My children are here -- Beat. Their eyes glaze over. Maggie instantly regrets mentioning her children.
5) 129) dialog: Twelve and ten. Very independent. Which allows me to come in early and work late -- 86.
6) 2) dialog: Really well I think! I know a lot of people are vying for this position, but I think I’m very qualified. And I’ve got some more interviews.
6) 28) dialog: (sleepily) .--hello?
6) 30) dialog: She turns on her bedside lamp and sits up, trying to orie herself.
6) 31) dialog: Cam... it’s almost four in the morning. Cam examines the skirt with pride.
6) 33) dialog: That’s terrific, Cam. You should probably get some sleep.
6) 35) dialog: But you must be tired --
6) 37) dialog: Cam, you know how important sleep is to --
6) 39) dialog: Cam... You are taking your lithium... aren’t you? Beat.
7) 2) dialog: But you could be.
7) 5) dialog: You promised to take your lithium.
7) 8) dialog: Cam, you said you would take responsibility for your condition --
7) 10) dialog: That’s not fair. You know how hard this was for me.
7) 12) dialog: No! It wasn’t hard to come, it wasn’t hard to come... Tears suddenly roll down Maggie’s face. Cam is startled.
7) 13) dialog: ...it was hard to leave. Every weekend. And have people think I was the worst mother in the world because I wanted my children to have a better life and I didn’t see any other way to get it. You’re from an old blue-blood family. When you live in squalor, it’s “eccentric.” When black people live in squalor, believe me, no one is charmed. Cam is quiet for a moment as that sinks in.
7) 15) text: CAM (cont'd) (beat) I haven’t made any headway on my bedroom. Maggie looks at him and nods, resigned. Then:
7) 16) dialog: I’m going to take the E.F. Hutton job. In New York. It’s my only offer.
7) 18) dialog: I’m not asking you to. You've done an amazing job. It’s time for me to take the girls. Cam reacts.
7) 21) dialog: There’s so much I love about you, Cam. And I don’t want to give up on you. But I just... I can’t.
7) 23) dialog: No! My plan was to come home and maybe I’d be with you and maybe I wouldn’t, but we’d still be a family. But none of that matters. These Boston firms don’t want me.
7) 26) dialog: Because, Cam, this is Boston. They want people like you. This hits Cam like a ton of bricks. His face hardens.
7) 47) dialog: Cam? Cam?
7) 49) dialog: Why are you wet? Cam doesn’t look at her. He takes out his bottle of lithi
7) 52) dialog: Yes. It’s beautiful. Cam swallows the pills with the full glass of water. He closes the medicine cabinet and sighs.
7) 59) dialog: I'll find an apartment in a very safe neighborhood.
7) 61) dialog: I‘1ll figure that out.
7) 63) dialog: You can ride your bikes when you come here.
7) 65) dialog: Daddy will take care of himself.
7) 72) dialog: Taking care of you alone has been a lot of pressure for your father.
7) 77) dialog: He needs a break.
7) 80) dialog: Daddy will visit and you’1l visit him. New York is an incredible city. You'll like it. I promise.
7) 87) dialog: (nods ) I was just thinking about that.
7) 89) dialog: You know what Faith said to me last night? She said: “You don’t lose your temper like Daddy and you keep the apartment nice, but the thing about Daddy is he’s always around. He’s always there.”
7) 91) dialog: I have a plan. I take this job and earn some money. The girls stay here with you. They keep riding their bikes. They stay with their friends. But we get them into a good private school where they can be challenged. I insist on that.
7) 93) dialog: If they come to New York they’1l be shut up like house pets in some dark apartment and I'1l be working till eight o’clock at night, every night. I don’t want that for them. Maggie looks over at the girls. Her heart breaks.
7) 94) dialog: They're my babies. Maggie buries her face in her hands. Cam holds out his ar
