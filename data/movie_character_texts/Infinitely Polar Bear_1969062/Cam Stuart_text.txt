4) 315) dialog: Girls, look. I’m sorry we can’t take the Bentley. It just doesn’t make sense. I know it’s disappointing. They don’t respond. Then, in a coldly rational voice:
4) 317) dialog: Sweetie, although crepes may be delicious, they’re not exactly the goldmine you think they are. Especially during a recession.
4) 319) dialog: (sighing) Gaga would never let me sell that car.
4) 321) dialog: That’s not how it works. It’s hard to explain. Beat.

4) 350) dialog: Dinner will be ready soon. It would be awfully nice to have a place to sit down and eat it.
4) 352) dialog: Now. Now. She keeps dancing. Suddenly Cam explodes, HURLING THE BOW AT THE WALL.
4) 353) dialog: Now! Both girls are startled out of their musical reverie. The Faith explodes:
4) 356) dialog: No! I’m the goddamn servant! All I do is cook for you and drive you around and tend to your every need... He watches, furious, as she stomps by him.
4) 357) dialog: ...-you treat me like a goddamn maid! Cam turns off the stove. Grabs his overcoat and scarf.
4) 358) dialog: I’ve got to get out of here. 71. Amelia jumps up from the piano and gets in his way.
4) 360) dialog: You don’t need a babysitter.
4) 362) dialog: You need to toughen up. What is there to be scared of? Wolves? Vampires?
4) 364) dialog: If a rapist knocks, don’t let him in.
4) 366) dialog: Just kick him in the balls! Amelia runs to block the door. Jock starts barking and jumping around.
4) 368) dialog: I don’t get it. You never want to be seen with me, you won’t have your friends over, you won’t let me talk to people -- I can’t take it anymore! I need to spend time with adults, not a bunch of bossy brats! Unhand my foot! 72. Cam leaves the apartment, slamming the door behind him. T dog barks constantly.
4) 373) dialog: (defeated) I guess so.
5) 0) text: Cam walks in. As he lights a cigarette: 73.
5) 1) dialog: (worn-down ) You see, girls? That chain is worthless. The only thing it provides is a false sense of security, and that’s the last thing you girls need. He hugs them and they hug him back.
5) 8) dialog: What? Oh. Broke up a dog fight. Stupid. (beat) We had to give Jock away. 74.

5) 29) dialog: Can I come?

5) 33) dialog: Stop saying that.
5) 36) dialog: How am I supposed to have my own life when you won’t let me do anything -- They leave, slamming the door.
5) 43) dialog: Any of you kids got a light? Amelia and Faith shoot him a withering look. Amelia start gathering her Tarot cards.
5) 47) dialog: You're all welcome to come over to our apartment... Faith and Amelia look at each other, furious. They both glare at him.
5) 50) dialog: But I think it could be fun --
5) 53) dialog: But I’1l make tea for everybody. And cinnamon toast. We’ve got lots of board games --
5) 55) dialog: (exploding) Big deal how you live! It’s not your fault! Tell them your Dad’s manic-depressive or bi-polar or whatever they’re calling it these days! Don’t not have friends because of me! The girls are thrown by this outburst. Cam slumps.
5) 56) dialog: Fuck it. Forget it. Never mind. He turns and walks back to the building, defeated. Faith Amelia look at each other, considering.
5) 63) dialog: Really? Amelia nods and closes the door.
5) 71) dialog: Would anyone like to learn how to make chocolate truffles from scratch?
5) 76) text: The children sit on a fallen tree trunk, watching, as Cam demonstrates on Amelia how to twist someone’s arm behind their back. Amelia grabs his arm and does it to him.

5) 97) dialog: That was the same dinner where she trundled across the room and punched me right in the nuts.
5) 100) dialog: What? Her mother’s black. She’s just testing you, being feisty. She smiles at him with real gratitude. She links her arm through his.
5) 102) dialog: No kidding. Amelia beat up the class bully last week. Kicked him so hard in the knee she put him on crutches.
5) 104) dialog: I felt quite proud.
5) 106) dialog: So do you. Well whaddaya know.
5) 108) dialog: Stop sleeping on the sofa. Let’s sleep in a bed together. Maggie laughs but doesn’t pull away.
5) 110) dialog: Why not? 84.
5) 112) dialog: That’s your reason?
5) 114) dialog: Then I’1l clean it up. Maggie laughs, teasing him.
5) 116) dialog: You never said anything about this before.
5) 118) dialog: And my room is not inviting to you?
5) 120) dialog: Definitely not to me. I’m cleaning it up. It’1ll take me two days tops. You’ll see. It’ll bea thing of beauty. They walk on. 85.
6) 1) dialog: How'd the interview go? Maggie puts on an upbeat front.
6) 3) dialog: Any one of these places would be lucky to have you. She smiles at him gratefully. INT. CAM’'S BEDROOM. DAY Cam stands in the middle of his messy bedroom, pulling ex books off the shelf and putting them in a box. He comes across The Collected Poems of Robert Frost. He opens the book. He sits down on the edge of the bed, reading. Amelia calls from the kitchen: 87.
6) 5) dialog: (yelling) Half a tablespoon and make sure you let it get nut-brown. Faith steps into the doorway. She is festooned with gold pink ribbons wrapped around her arms and upper torso.
6) 7) dialog: ...What costume?
6) 9) dialog: Right.
6) 11) dialog: (lamely) Right. I know.
6) 13) dialog: I am making it. I said I would make it and I will.
6) 15) dialog: Hey, I was in the army.
6) 17) dialog: You got it, buggins. Faith claps her hands and excitedly breaks into her stomp Flamenco dance. The neighbor below bangs on the ceiling.
6) 20) dialog: I just have to make this skirt, two hundred times bigger.
6) 23) dialog: Goddamnit! I can’t do it! I can’t fucking do it! He yanks the fabric out of the sewing machine, throws it the floor, jumps on it, picks it up, throws it at the wal it flutters to the floor. This only fuels his rage. He spastically grabs it, crosses to the open window and hurl out the unfinished skirt. He pushes his hair back, looks around wild-eyed and crazy.
6) 26) dialog: Your skirt is a joke compared to what this skirt is going to look like. Cam downs the last of a cup of coffee, cracks open a beer takes a swig.
6) 29) dialog: (into phone) Guess what I did?
6) 32) dialog: I just made your daughter an incredible skirt. Sparkles, ruffles... It’s probably my greatest achievement since I rebuilt the engine to my Dad’s Studebaker in college.
6) 34) dialog: I don’t want to sleep. 90.
6) 36) dialog: But I’m not tired. Maggie sits up.
6) 38) dialog: Come on, Maggie! Name me one other father in America who is up right now sewing their daughter a flamenco skirt!
6) 40) dialog: Actually, I haven’t taken my lithium since you left. Maggie hangs her head.
6) 41) dialog: I find that if I take small, steady sips of beer throughout the day, it keeps me on an even keel... He takes a long, loud, defiant sip of his beer.
6) 42) dialog: Abhh... Maggie looks stricken.
7) 1) dialog: I’m not manic.
7) 3) dialog: I was excited. People are allowed to get excited when they can’t sew worth a damn and they manage to pull off a flamenco skirt that gets their daughter the second-most applause at the talent show.
7) 6) dialog: And you promised to love me for better or for worse. The MAITRE D’ hurries over to them. MAITRE D’ Excuse me, sir. But our dress code requires you to wear a tie... Without missing a beat, Cam pulls an untied bowtie out of jacket pocket. As he ties it without looking: 92.
7) 7) dialog: Let me say one thing about lithium - - no one even knows if it works. Same goes for haldol, valproic acid, and all their other so-called treatments. I’m just a guinea pig. And you never would’ve known I'd stopped taking it if I hadn’t told you. I’m an idiot. A fucking self- destructive fuckhead. His bowtie is perfectly tied. The Maitre D’ nods and quic retreats from this conversation.
7) 9) dialog: The way you’ve taken responsibility for your children?
7) 11) dialog: I know, I know, it was hard to come every weekend...
7) 14) dialog: If it’s any consolation, no one seems charmed by my squalor either. (MORE )
7) 15) text: CAM (cont'd) (beat) I haven’t made any headway on my bedroom. Maggie looks at him and nods, resigned. Then:
7) 17) dialog: New York? Maggie, I can’t keep doing this all by myself -- She puts her hand on his arm.
7) 19) dialog: You're taking the girls to New York? But what about me and you? What about us? Maggie looks away. She is anguished. Cam seethes.
7) 20) dialog: I knew it. I knew it.
7) 22) dialog: So were you even trying to get a job here? Or was this your plan all along?
7) 24) dialog: Why don’t they want you?
7) 27) dialog: You want a job in Boston? I’1l get you a job in Boston! Cam stands and storms out of the restaurant. INT. DICK’S OFFICE. DAY DICK, 40, sits behind a large oak desk with a view onto t financial district. He wears a suit and tie. He is tall, handsome and athletic. The walls are hung with pictures o sailboats.

7) 29) dialog: Not really, Dickie. No.
7) 31) dialog: As you know, Maggie’s just gotten her MBA.
7) 33) dialog: I was wondering why there isn’t a place for her here. It is a family firm, after all. Dick sighs and looks sorry.
7) 35) dialog: So you're telling me that when Dickie Jr and...the other one... (MORE )
7) 36) text: CAM (cont'd) graduate from college, they won't land here?
7) 38) dialog: God damn it, Dickie! I know how it works! You create the position!
7) 40) dialog: I don’t give a shit about your Christmas party. I want you to hire my wife. She works fifty thousand times harder than any of you! Dick gets up from the desk.
7) 42) dialog: Do you have any idea how hard it is? Do you have any idea what sacrifices she’s made? She needs a job here! In Boston! Cam picks up a model sailboat and hurls it at the wall.
7) 50) dialog: Girls asleep? She nods. He empties three large pills into his hand.
7) 51) dialog: Faith show you her skirt?
7) 53) dialog: I couldn't get you a job in Boston. As he walks past her into his bedroom:
7) 54) dialog: I jumped in the Charles River. INT. APARTMENT CAM’S BEDROOM. CONTINUOUS His bedroom is a pit. Cam sits down on his bed, among the piles of clothes.
7) 55) dialog: I’m just going to miss them is all. Maggie nods, with great sympathy.
7) 56) text: I know. 97. She exits, gently closing the door. Cam looks around at h room, the manifestation of failure.
7) 66) dialog: I'll go to dinner parties, movies, I’ll have escapades. Faith and Amelia look disapproving.
7) 69) dialog: That’s not true.
7) 71) dialog: Well, that’s true.
7) 79) dialog: I did do that. I did that.
7) 82) dialog: Get used to it.
7) 85) dialog: All the live-long day. Thurgood laughs and runs off to join the other kids. Magg smiles. Cam stares into the fire.
7) 86) dialog: I can’t visit you in New York. Too much speed and noise and all the people out on the streets all night. Winds me up. Knocks me off track.
7) 88) dialog: I do understand why you don’t want to live with me. I’m a much better father than I was a husband.
7) 90) dialog: I thought that irritated them. 100. He reaches through the flames and turns the shishkebabs w long metal tongs. Maggie stares off. Then she takes a dee breath.
7) 92) dialog: Maggie. Are you sure? Maggie stands and walks over to Cam.
7) 105) dialog: (pleasantly surprised) You’re awake. I thought you were going to sleep the whole way home. He quickly stabs out his cigarette. Faith squirms awake.
7) 106) dialog: We just crossed into Massachusetts. We're making great time. Faith climbs into the front passenger seat.
7) 107) dialog: You both conked out so quickly. Must’ve been a fun weekend.
7) 110) dialog: Of course I know.
7) 113) dialog: Oh boy. Poor Mommy.
7) 115) dialog: Because it’s hard to conduct a romance when your children are gunning for your lover.
7) 117) dialog: Lover, swain, beau, whatever.
7) 119) dialog: Because Mommy tries hard. She wanted things to go differently.
7) 122) dialog: Me three. The girls laugh. Then Faith looks back at her sister and rolls her eyes with irritation.
7) 124) dialog: Big Little... what is it?
7) 126) dialog: Please, darling. Don’t worry about me. I’11 be fine. They drive in silence. Then, starting in an absurdly deep voice, Cam breaks into “Annie Laurie.” He sings in a full Scottish brogue, his voice getting very high and squeaky forlorn on the chorus.
7) 127) dialog: Maxwellton Braes are bonnie Where early lies the dew Twas there that Annie Laurie Gave me her Promise True Gave me her promise true... And ne'er forgot shall be... For Bonnie Annie Laurie, I'd lay me doon and dee... The girls join in. As they sing, a series of cuts: -- Cam takes Amelia and Faith on a walk through Mt. Aubur Cemetery. -- Amelia runs between the shelves of books in an overstu bookstore. She rounds the corner and nestles in next to C who sits on the floor, with Faith on his lap. -- Cam proudly leads Amelia, Faith, Thurgood, Kim and Ali a tour through the grand old mansion on Beacon Hill. The children are blown away by the splendor. As they file pas Mr. Fabrini on their way out, thanking him, he nods curtl and gives them all a very tight smile. He is clearly extremely annoyed by Cam and can’t wait to get rid of him Cam grins back at him, victorious.
7) 133) dialog: Nice shot, Amelia! Amelia waves at Cam, who is cheering from the sidelines. Another girl runs and shoots into the net.
7) 134) dialog: Nice shot, Amelia’s friend! Amelia jogs back to the line of girls.
7) 137) dialog: He gives Amelia a thumbs up. He drops to his knee and tak some pictures.
7) 141) dialog: But I finally convinced Eliot Perkins to let me borrow his boat. I thought we could have a picnic on the river.
7) 143) dialog: It’s four o’clock.
7) 145) dialog: Maybe Annie wants to take a ride down the Charles River.
7) 147) dialog: I’m serious. She lives in Boston. How many times has she gotten a ride home on a boat? Now they are the only ones left on the field.
7) 149) dialog: (to Faith) What about Fifi, do you think she’d like to have a picnic on the water?
7) 151) dialog: You will never find a more beautiful boat or a more perfect day to go out on the river. They are unmoved. Cam shakes his head, giving up. 106.
7) 152) dialog: Okay, well, I guess I'll tell the Charles River to go fuck itself. Both girls laugh at his ridiculous reaction.
7) 156) dialog: Oh, darlings, I’m so proud of you. So's Mommy.
7) 158) dialog: We just are. They back away from him, waving, then turn and head acros the field. He stands, watching them go. They glance back over their shoulders, smile and wave again quickly. He wa mournfully. They quicken their pace. Then he calls out:
7) 159) dialog: I love you! They stop dead. They whirl around and steam toward him. They are completely enraged.
7) 161) dialog: Do what?
7) 163) dialog: I’m just watching you walk. 107.
7) 165) dialog: Why?
7) 167) dialog: I don’t want you to feel bad.
7) 169) dialog: I’m just watching you walk across the field, for chrissake! I think I’m allowed! The girls sigh, frustrated. Amelia steps toward him, look him dead in the eye. She is stern, deliberate.
7) 171) dialog: I’m not asking you too! They shake their heads.
7) 176) dialog: Hands in his pockets, he watches them walk away. Pressed together, in lock-step, they cross the playing fields. Autumn leaves skitter around their feet. They keep walking. They do not turn around. They do not look back. Then, just before they recede from view, they stop and tu They face him from this great distance. He brightens and holds up his hand. They each hold up a hand. He makes a fist in the air as if to say courage, onward. The girls d the same. The three of them stand like that for a moment. Then Amelia and Faith turn and run in the opposite direct disappearing into the gymnasium. Cam looks up at the sky. He smiles to himself. He pulls a tam o’shanter with a red pompom from his pocket and puts on his head. He lights a cigarette and walks toward the river. FADE OUT.
