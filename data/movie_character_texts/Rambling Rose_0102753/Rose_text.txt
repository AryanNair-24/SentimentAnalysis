At the moment he is finishing brushing his teeth at the bureau, using an old fashioned water pitcher and bowl. The CAMERA FOLLOWS as h walks across the room in the light of the lamp by his bed looks around cautiously, then picks up the mattress of hi bed. He pushes it far back and we see springs. He takes o small "book" or pamphlet and stares gravely at it. CLOSE-UP: The front cover of the pamphlet. We see the ove title: LITTLE DIRTY COMIC BOOKS. And beneath it: BLONDIE DAGWOOD. And beneath that, in smaller letters: "Mr. Dithe Comes to Dinner -- and How!" We see Buddy's hands in the shot, and he opens the pamphlet and we catch enough of a glimpse of the thing to know it is pretty awful -- a draw maybe of "Blondie" stark naked with a finger in her mouth going, "Tee-Hee!" ON Buddy, as he stares down with grave intentness at the Little Dirty Comic Book. Slyly now, he retraces his steps the bureau and takes out a flashlight. He goes back to th bed, switches off the lamp, gets in the bed and turns on flashlight and pulls the covers over his head. We hear a faint SOUND on the track and Buddy suddenly yanks back th covers, puts the flashlight on the table by the bed and throws the Little Dirty Comic Book under the bed. He lies pillow and pretends he's asleep, and we hear the door of room OPEN and a CREAKING on the floor. ANOTHER ANGLE, on a weepy Rose in a very thin nightgown. shot is FROM BELOW as Buddy might see her as she stands o his bed. She looks very lonely and unhappy and is half crying.

52) 5) dialog: I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
52) 7) dialog: It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
52) 9) dialog: Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  (pauses, realizes this isn't too dignified) But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
52) 11) dialog: Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
52) 13) dialog: Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
52) 15) dialog: I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then. (sighs tragically) But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me. ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed. Buddy has propped on an elbow and is staring down at her breasts in moonlight -- we see the soft notch between her breasts in open V of her thin nightgown. She is completely unself conscious with him.
52) 18) dialog: (casually, doesn't object) What did you expect?
52) 20) dialog: Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
52) 22) dialog: Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
52) 24) dialog: (dreamily, thinking of Daddy as she smokes cigarette and stares up at the ceiling) You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
52) 26) dialog: No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
52) 28) dialog: (frowns) Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
52) 30) dialog: Buddy, get your hand offa me! Quit it, get you hand away... Takes his wrist.

54) 7) dialog: (lighting cigarette) Don't mention it.
54) 9) dialog: Who would want to do such a thing as that?
54) 11) dialog: (stares wonderingly at him) You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
54) 13) dialog: There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
54) 15) dialog: Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
54) 17) dialog: (her eyes open wide as he whispers) Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
54) 19) dialog: Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
54) 21) dialog: No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
54) 23) dialog: Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
54) 25) dialog: (softens despite herself) Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.

But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me... Rose bows her head and begins crying into her hands. CUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Buddy. We hear the soft sound of R weeping over the shot. Buddy is affected, his flinty chil heart has been touched, but he is not quite ready to admi yet. He is struggling with himself, trying to remain "coo and not show his emotion. He frowns, moistens his lips, swallows. With seeming coolness, very much as in the scen with Doll in which he deprecated Daddy's stand at Thermopylae, he shrugs.
71) 5) dialog: You don't understand. They'd blame me, not you. And they'd think I was awful, a disgustin' girl, which I am, but Buddy, please don't tell them. Please don't. Ill have to go and I love it here, I love your whole fam'ly, your Daddy, your Mother...
