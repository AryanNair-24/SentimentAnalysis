She wears glasses, has Victorian hairdo and a 1930ish style dress. At the moment Mother is absorbed in her studies -- notebooks and histor books are littered and piled everywhere around her chair. is drinking a Coca-Cola and smoking a cigarette held by a bobbie pin. Calmly, she glances up as Buddy enters the ro The CAMERA pulls back to include him.
19) 2) dialog: Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
19) 4) dialog: Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
19) 6) dialog: All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
19) 8) dialog: Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
20) 0) text: A shot of Mother, Rose, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the livi room of the Hillyer household. DOLL is a pretty little gi of about 11, WASKI a boy of 5. Mother's tone is very gent very sweet, very kind. Her unabashed admiration for her o children has an ingenuousness that is more amusing than offensive.
20) 1) dialog: Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
20) 3) dialog: When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
20) 5) dialog: (serenely) There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll.
20) 7) dialog: Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose? Rose has not as yet caught on to Mother's style and is staring at her with lips apart and blue eyes slightly pop
20) 9) dialog: Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it. Thus, Mother. Slightly cuckoo, a bit out of touch with reality, but no fool. A very intelligent woman really, an very, very gentle and kind. Her style, however, takes a little getting used to and he long speech throws Rose completely. She stares at Mother speechless open-mouthed awe, unable to say a word. The CAMERA moves in CLOSER on Rose as she moistens her li swallows, tries to talk and can't. She is very, very nerv Now she flinches and looks around as we hear a deep mascu VOICE OVER the shot. It is the voice of DADDY, Mr. Hillye Buddy's father.

The CAMERA PANS to follow her and we pick up Mrs. Hillyer, Mother. It is a nice day and she is studying out on the patio, books and notebooks piled around. Rose glances dow curiously at her.
23) 2) dialog: More history, Rose.
23) 4) dialog: Well, I am working on my thesis.
23) 6) dialog: (looks up, and gently) Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
23) 8) dialog: Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
23) 10) dialog: (gently) Well, you run on now.
25) 2) dialog: Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
25) 4) dialog: Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
25) 7) dialog: What?
25) 9) dialog: (adjusts hearing aid) Oh. Did you say something?
25) 11) dialog: Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
25) 13) dialog: And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.

27) 2) dialog: Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
27) 4) dialog: Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
27) 6) dialog: I'm not in the fourth dimension -- (points a finger at him) -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
27) 8) dialog: (reaches up, takes his hand) Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.

She wears an attractive little apron and is smiling, blushing, happy as Daddy teases and jokes at her
31) 5) dialog: Rose does have a gift for cooking. She learns so fast, but mainly I think it's that she tries so hard.
32) 0) text: ANOTHER ANGLE, on the family as they eat dinner. Rose is seated at the table now. She is picking lifelessly at her food and glancing from time to time with a lovesick expression at Daddy, who is busy eating and seems wholly unaware of it. Mother also is wholly unaware, but all the children know what is happening. Rose takes a gravy for a biscuit and spills a little, her hand is trembling.
32) 1) dialog: (gently, suspects absolutely nothing) Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
32) 3) dialog: You look sick if you ask me. I hate to leave you with the dishes and all, but I'm supposed to go to a meeting of the Garden Club this evening. (to Daddy) I'll need the car keys.
32) 5) dialog: I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.

The ot children, Doll and Waski, are seated at the kitchen table having hamburgers for lunch. They are happily smiling wit schadenfreude amusement at their brother's discomfiture.
74) 1) dialog: Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  (points a finger at him) And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
74) 3) dialog: (sadly) Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed in you. You mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image.
74) 5) dialog: Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
74) 7) dialog: But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
74) 9) dialog: I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
74) 11) dialog: This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.

Mother takes the bottle and pours ou tablespoon of castor oil.
74) 13) dialog: This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
74) 15) dialog: Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it. 
74) 17) dialog: What did you say, Brother? 
74) 19) dialog: No, you didn't say that, Brother.
74) 25) dialog: Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  (the children at once simmer down) The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
74) 27) dialog: (frowns, adjusts hearing aid) What'd you say, Brother?
74) 29) dialog: Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  (glances around at sound of an opening door) Hello, Rose, dear...  (her eyes open wide as she stares at Rose, disconcerted; now weakly) ... my, you're... looking pretty... CUT TO a shot of Rose in the doorway of the kitchen. She quite an apparition. She wears bright red lipstick, pink rouge on her cheeks, mascara and her hair is coiffed up i some outlandish manner, but her clothes are the most remarkable thing of all. The skirt is of strange, pink, semi-shiny and very thin material and has about a dozen tiny little flowers that c be rosebuds sewed on it. It fits extremely snugly to say least. The blouse seems a composite: it has frilly white sleeves that are opaque and otherwise is made of filmy wh material that is hardly opaque at all. She has no bra and breasts are half visible, the nipples denting the materia It is pretty wild for 1935. She seems to have on no under of any kind; the skirt, which clings to her like a bathin suit, shows no panty seams. She is carrying a shiny black patent leather pocketbook and has on high heel black pate leather shoes and no stockings. An ingenuous little smile on her face.
74) 31) dialog: (smiling, slightly aghast) Well, it's... very gay. We hear the SOUND of the Model A on the driveway.
74) 34) dialog: (makes up her mind to defend Rose) Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  (tactfully) But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
74) 41) dialog: Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
74) 47) dialog: You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
74) 50) dialog: (to Daddy) I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
74) 52) dialog: (genuinely worried) I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
74) 61) dialog: (a wee mite worried) Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
74) 63) dialog: You're not having lunch?
74) 65) dialog: Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.

76) 0) text: CUT TO Mother and Daddy at the kitchen table.
76) 1) dialog: (earnestly) I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
76) 3) dialog: Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
76) 5) dialog: I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
76) 7) dialog: He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
76) 9) dialog: But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality. (takes his hand) Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
76) 11) dialog: (rises, again takes his hand) Be kind to her. She loves you so much. (Daddy stiffens slightly, and she adds) In a perfectly proper way, of course.
106) 2) dialog: What time is it?
106) 4) dialog: Is she all right?
106) 6) dialog: Bruises and broken bones, what kind of thing is that to say? Daddy walks INTO THE SHOT, sits on the edge of the bed.
106) 7) dialog: Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
106) 9) dialog: Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
106) 11) dialog: (doubtfully) Well, time will tell, won't it?

128) 16) dialog: Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
128) 18) dialog: (in a real snit, afraid he will fire Rose) And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
128) 24) dialog: (with fire in her eyes) Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
128) 26) dialog: It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
128) 28) dialog: (simmers down at once, now calmly) Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.

188) 10) dialog: I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
188) 12) dialog: It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
190) 8) dialog: (looks up, sees Buddy in patio window) Brother, get out of that window! Buddy ducks down out of eight instantly. Both Mother and Daddy, however, are too preoccupied and upset to be conce with him.
190) 10) dialog: (as Rose begins crying) Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?

190) 15) dialog: That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?

190) 19) dialog: (gently, a tiny frown, a bit shocked) Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.

193) 4) dialog: Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
193) 6) dialog: (rather coldly, seems disenchanted with him) No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.

195) 18) dialog: (slowly rises to her feet and in a trembling voice) Over... my... dead... body! A long, frozen pause as both Daddy and Dr. Martinson star Mother in surprise. She stares at the Doctor with fire in eyes. He seems already to shrink a little. Finally she sp with a calm fury.
195) 19) dialog: Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
195) 21) dialog: You'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? Don't you think I know what you've just said and don't you think I understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit? Dr. Martinson stares at her in fear and shock, intimidate the calm fury and ice-cold moral indignation. He opens his mouth as if to speak, but no sound comes out Mother turns to Daddy.
195) 22) dialog: I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
195) 24) dialog: I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
195) 26) dialog: Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
195) 28) dialog: (with a quiet fury) Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?
195) 32) dialog: I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
195) 34) dialog: (icy cold) I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
195) 36) dialog: Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
