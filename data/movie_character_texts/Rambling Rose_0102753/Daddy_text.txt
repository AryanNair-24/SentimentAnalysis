Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?

We welcome you to our home, Rosebud, we all welcome you from the heart and hope you are happy here. Rose bites her lip, her eyes are filled with tears; an inaudible whisper.

195) 27) dialog: Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
195) 30) dialog: Well, now, I admit... in Rose's case, it would be cruel. If Rose wasn't attractive and pretty... well, it would probably be bad for almost any young woman. I don't know exactly what I was thinking about, the doctor said it and it sounded reasonable. Daddy finally looks up at Mother and admits his error lik man.
195) 31) dialog: But you're right, darlin', you're absolutely dead right, it would be an awful and horrible thing to do. I'm sorry, honey, forgive me, I didn't mean it.

219) 22) dialog: (simply, quietly) No, son, she is dead. 
219) 24) dialog: I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
219) 26) dialog: She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
220) 7) dialog: (simply) I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
220) 9) dialog: It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more, Daddy pauses, in trouble emotionally, but gets a grip on himself and in an almost dispassionate manner; but powerf feeling is behind his words.
220) 10) dialog: She got cancer of the breast, was operated on and had a seven-year recovery, then after a brief illness passed on in her sleep, as the man with whom she'd lived in beautiful love and harmony for twenty-five years held her hand. That is what happened, son, and God rest her lovely soul! CUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer. Despite his effor to control himself, tears are in his eyes. He clenches hi teeth, takes a big swallow of his drink. ANOTHER ANGLE on them both as Daddy rises.
220) 11) dialog: And now, if you are through with that Yankee whisky, we'll go to the Holiday Inn and get some dinner.
220) 14) dialog: Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
220) 16) dialog: (stops and firmly) Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
220) 21) dialog: (gently) Rose isn't dead, son. Not really. Some of us die, but some of us don't. Rose lives. As long as some little girl somewhere gets herself up and goes out, Rose lives. CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy, now middle-aged Willcox Hillyer, as they walk toward the entrance of the Holiday MUSIC.
