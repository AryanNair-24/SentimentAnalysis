The other one says, "Yeah, I know, and  such ... small portions." Well, that's  essentially how I feel about life.  Full  of loneliness and misery and suffering  and unhappiness, and it's all over much  too quickly.  The-the other important  joke for me is one that's, uh, usually  attributed to Groucho Marx, but I think  it appears originally in Freud's wit and  its relation to the unconscious.  And it  goes like this-I'm paraphrasing: Uh ...  "I would never wanna belong to any club  that would have someone like me for a  member." That's the key joke of my adult  life in terms of my relationships with  women.  Tsch, you know, lately the  strangest things have been going  through my mind, 'cause I turned forty,  tsch, and I guess I'm going through a  life crisis or something, I don't know.  I, uh ... and I'm not worried about aging.   I'm not one o' those characters, you know.  Although I'm balding slightly on top, that's  about the worst you can say about me.  I,  uh, I think I'm gonna get better as I get  older, you know?  I think I'm gonna be the- the balding virile type, you know, as  opposed to say the, uh, distinguished  gray, for instance, you know?
