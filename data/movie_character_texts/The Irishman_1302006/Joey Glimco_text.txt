75) 1) dialog: You’re only here because Jimmy’s getting screwed. It’s the Seafarers Union trying to sign up the same non-union cab drivers we are. Lesbians, a lot of them, for some reason.
76) 1) dialog: This is what we have to deal with, how to get these drivers to join us rather than Paul Hall’s union. He’s bullshitting people that he can get a better contract than Jimmy. Frank walks over to the woman’s cab, opens the door and hot-wires
77) 1) dialog: You understand, you’re here because nobody knows you or what the fuck you're doing.
77) 3) dialog: Jimmy has Daley’s cops’ okay on this. They won’t help us push but they’1l make sure nobody stops us.

80) 1) dialog: One thing about Jimmy, never make him wait. You have a meeting with him, get there on time. Get there early. I can’t stress this enough. He goes by time. Joey taps at some watermelons.
80) 3) dialog: The other thing about him is he doesn’t drink. Imagine that? He’s the head of all the truck drivers in the world and don’t drink. He won’t even let you drink around him. He calls it idiot juice.

82) 1) dialog: (excited) You shoulda seen them sink right in the water. One after the other. I’‘1l bet this morning, when they went looking for their cabs, they didn’t know what hit them.
82) 3) dialog: It wasn’t my idea. It was Frank. Hoffa looks at Frank, impressed.
82) 5) dialog: He just took over the pier. They did exactly what he said. (gobbles up watermelon slice) I never seen a guy walk through a crowd like he does and he doesn’t touch a single person! I’m not kidding. I swear. Guys who didn’t even know him, never saw him before in their lives, still got out of his way. I’m telling you it was like “the parting of the waves” - like Moses! Hoffa looks over at a clearly mortified Frank listening to Glimco’s excessive praise.
