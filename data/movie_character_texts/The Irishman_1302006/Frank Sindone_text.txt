172) 16) dialog: No.
172) 18) dialog: The other Tony.
172) 20) dialog: Salerno. That Tony means something to Jimmy. It gives him pause. But not enough to convince him to change what he’s doing.

174) 0) text: The Vegas-style supper club looks like it was plucked off Fremont Street and dropped here, but in fact was just moved five miles from Philly across the Delaware River. Usually it’s someone like Al Martino or Dean Martin or Liberace on the marquee, but tonight it reads: ‘Frank Sheeran Appreciation Night.’

178) 6) dialog: And to Jimmy. I can’t tell you what this means to me to get this honor from you. Jimmy’s the only guy to get the job done and I promise all my support and help to you, Jimmy. (mild applause) Russ bet me I was going to mess up my speech... so all I can say is, thank you all from the bottom of my heart. I know I don’t deserve all this tonight.

181) 3) dialog: I don’t know what to say.
181) 6) dialog: It’s what it is?

182) 8) dialog: They are. They’re more than a little concerned. There's widespread concern. (MORE)
182) 10) dialog: Tony told Russell to tell me to tell you what it is. Jimmy looks at Frank a bit stunned finally.
182) 12) dialog: Don’t say that, Jimmy.
182) 14) dialog: Jimmy, what am I supposed to do. I got to go back and tell the old man - what. That you’re still not listening to him? He ain’t used to people not listening to him.
182) 16) dialog: Then I don’t know, you should maybe keep some bodies around for protection.
183) 0) text: Jimmy dancing with Peggy. Frank, at his family’s table now, watches them, a more-than-a-little-concerned look on his face, though Peggy, noticing it, can’t imagine why.

185) 3) dialog: He said let’s work this thing out. Sit down after the wedding and work it out. 108
185) 5) dialog: We could do it at your place if you want.
185) 7) dialog: Or anywhere.
185) 9) dialog: I know.
185) 11) dialog: I know.
185) 13) dialog: Of course the Little Guy.
185) 15) dialog: There’s no point just the three of us.
185) 17) dialog: It's time to sit down, Jimmy. Everybody says so.
185) 19) dialog: You’re making me work hard.
185) 22) dialog: He’s thinking about it.
185) 26) dialog: Tomorrow morning.

Russell stays in the car. 115 Frank climbs the steps of the plane and sits in one of its six seats. The pilot closes the door without looking at him and returns to the cockpit. As the plane begins to taxi, Frank looks out the window at the Lincoln.
190) 0) text: The plane descends over the north shore of Lake Erie. Lands on the Pontiac Airfield. The pilot lowers the steps and Frank climbs out and walks to a parked Ford that’s empty. He gets in, finds its keys under the mat, starts it up.

He checks an address scribbled on a Howard Johnson's napkin. Pulls over and regards a brick-and-shingled house. He notes a Buick parked at the end of a single-lane driveway running alongside the house. Opens the glove box and takes out the .22. He gets out of the car, shoves the pistol in his back waist-band under his jacket, climbs the steps of the house and opens the unlocked front door - 116
192) 0) text: A man on his hands and knees looks up at Frank through Coke-bottle glasses.
192) 2) dialog: Sally. Frank surveys the entry. Then walks into the adjacent living room, glimpsing as he goes two young Italian guys in the kitchen down the hall, playing cards. Sally Bugs comes over, parts the living room blinds and looks out.
192) 8) text: 117 Frank and Sally Bugs come out of the house and approach the Mercury.
192) 11) dialog: Chuckie.
192) 19) dialog: I’1l sit back there.
194) 12) dialog: Hi, Jimmy.
194) 14) dialog: Russell decided to come. But not here. He doesn’t know the place. It’s not comfortable for him.
194) 16) dialog: To help straighten all this out. That changes things. Jimmy relaxes a little. 120
194) 28) dialog: It’s all right. Frank nods. Jimmy finally gets into the back seat next to Sally.
194) 32) dialog: I came as soon as I got in.
194) 34) dialog: No. Russell had some business in Port Clinton this morning.
194) 36) dialog: Sally’s not staying. 122
195) 0) text: The Mercury pulls into the driveway behind the Buick and the Ford and idles. Jimmy and Frank get out. Sally Bugs comes around and gets into the passenger seat. As Chuckie backs the car out, Jimmy and Frank head for the house. Jimmy - as he always does with whoever he’s with - walks ahead.
197) 0) text: The plane lands, taxis to a stop. The pilot, again careful not to look at Frank, lowers the steps. Frank comes down them and crosses to the Lincoln, where Russell is napping. Frank climbs in, shuts the door. Russell wakes at the sound of it. Just by looking at Frank, he can tell the little errand in Detroit has been taken care of. Frank starts the car and they drive off to pick up their wives at the Howard Johnson's. 124
198) 0) text: Teamster lawyer Bill Bufalino - who represented Frank against the meat packing company long ago - and Hoffa in Nashville - escorts his daughter down the aisle. The church is packed with friends and relatives of the bride and groom, union and mob guys, Russell and Carrie with Frank and Irene. Frank just stares straight ahead.
199) 0) text: A TV broadcasts a news report on Hoffa’s disappearance. He’s been missing a couple days now. Frank comes in from outside, takes his coat off, regards the TV and his wife and daughters who are watching it.
199) 1) dialog: Still no word? Irene shakes her head no. Frank pours himself a drink.
199) 2) dialog: I should call Jo.
199) 5) dialog: Why what.
199) 8) dialog: I’1l call her now. 125 Peggy watches her father turn and head upstairs.
199) 9) dialog: She stopped talking to me that day. August 3rd, 1975.
200) 0) text: Frank looks as thoughtful and concerned as he ever has.
200) 1) dialog: She’s got a good job and lives outside Philly now but my daughter Peggy disappeared from my life that day.
201) 0) text: Alone in his bedroom, Frank sits on the edge of his bed dialing a phone. He can hear the report from downstairs faintly up here as people who know nothing theorize about the disappearance. The call connects.
201) 1) dialog: Jo? It’s Frank. (listens, nods) Whatever you need, anything I can do, I’m here. She’s crying now. He puts the receiver to his head like it’s a gun ... then back to his ear.
201) 2) dialog: It’s gonna be all right. I’m sure he’s all right.
205) 1) dialog: It was no more complicated than that.
206) 0) text: Frank is being questioned by an Assistant U.S. Attorney.
206) 2) dialog: On the advice of counsel, I respectfully decline to answer that question under the protection afforded me by the Constitution, on the grounds that my answer might tend to incriminate me.

218) 2) dialog: I’m going to say to you one time, I’ve listened to you, now you listen to me. I’ve worked for 44 years, and I never took one dime illegal off Boffa or nobody else. What you think don’t interest me. All I know is I paid him. What he does with the money is his business.
219) 0) text: Frank's car inches through the car wash covered in suds.
222) 0) text: Frank comes in with a paper bag, limps across the cafeteria, sits with Russell. Seeing the bag -

223) 0) text: Frank comes out to the exercise yard as Russell in his wheelchair is being pushed by another inmate the other way.
223) 1) dialog: Where you going?
223) 3) dialog: To what?
226) 0) text: The elderly men and women, dotting the rec room like checkers on an abandoned board, playing cards and dominoe and Candyland. Frank sits apart from them in a wheelchair, the white shirt, the gold watch, the gold ring, his eyes hidden behind the aviator sunglasses. 134 He’s been here for months. And no one but him is watching the TV with the sound down low: Images of the war in Kosovo. Bombs. Carnage. Death.
227) 0) text: An orderly assists Frank as he struggles out of a car with his aluminum canes.
227) 1) dialog: I got it. I’m fine. You stay here.
228) 1) dialog: Peggy, don’t. I just want to talk to you. She walks away from the counter toward the back. Goes through a door and closes it. The other customers look at Frank. EXT. DOLORES’S HOUSE - PHILLY - DAY - 2000 The orderly’s car, parked outside a small house. He leans against it, smoking a cigarette. INT. DOLORES’S HOUSE - PHILLY - DAY - 2000 Frank sits with one of his other daughters - Dolores - now in her 40s.
228) 3) dialog: Call her. Tell her I want to talk to her. 135
228) 5) dialog: I want to tell her I’m sorry.
228) 7) dialog: I know I wasn’t such a good father. I tried to be. I tried to protect her. All of you.
228) 10) dialog: But I was just trying to keep you from getting hurt. Dolores regards him a moment. He looks helpless. Hapless. Hopeless. Eventually -
229) 2) dialog: Burial.
229) 4) dialog: That’s okay. Frank surveys the rows of caskets from his wheelchair, the orderly by his side.
229) 6) dialog: It’s for me. His eyes settle on a metal one, green as the green on the Irish flag.
229) 7) dialog: That one.
230) 0) text: The orderly again waits for Frank outside, smoking another cigarette, idly looking off at a backhoe digging a grave. He notices a parked black car. Two men in it. Just sitting.
231) 1) dialog: We're all terminal. And sooner or later. Everybody put here has a date when he’s gonna go. And I think... it could be... there's gotta be something somewhere. (MORE)
231) 3) dialog: There's gotta be something when you go cause how the hell did this whole thing start? What they taught you as a kid? People smarter than me can't figure it out. But there's gotta be something to it. So if there's something good... if it is... I want a shot at it. That’s why I would never go for cremation. It's so final. That’s the hardest part of anybody when they bury is when they go into the ground. Because it's so final. You know what I mean? If you go into a building. The building's there. Your crypt is there. It has to be a metal casket and they have you in the room. And all that there. It's just not as final - you're dead - but it's not as final. Frank stands before them, considering them. There’s no good choice - or bad choice for that matter. A girl from the office with a diagram on a clipboard waits for him to decide. Doesn’t rush him. Finally, he points.
231) 4) dialog: That one, I guess.
232) 0) text: The same black car from the cemetery parked here now. The two men who were in it - young FBI agents - sit with Frank on the porch of the building. He actually seems fine having them here. At least they’re visitors.
232) 1) dialog: I’m sorry but I have to direct you to my attorney Mr. Ragano if you want to talk about Mr. Hoffa - or any other matter for that Matter. I got nothing new to say.
232) 3) dialog: Who’s dead?
232) 5) dialog: He's dead? Who did it?
232) 8) dialog: You seem like nice fellas. And I appreciate you coming to see me. But I can’t help you.
233) 0) text: Frank sits in his wheelchair in the chapel of the assisted living facility, a few faded snapshots in his lap. He slowly runs a hand through his hair as he looks at a snapshot of himself with Russell. Eventually - we see that there’s a young priest with him.
233) 2) dialog: Say it. See if I do.
233) 4) dialog: You say it then (I'll follow) - 139
233) 6) dialog: I go so far - “Hail Mary full of grace, Our Lord is with thee -
233) 8) dialog: - amongst women -- That’s about as far as I go.
233) 10) dialog: Yeah, why don’t you.
233) 12) dialog: - Holy Mary, Mother of God / Pray for us sinners / Now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
233) 13) dialog: Well, I say what I know - forgive me for not knowing the other half. The intention is there.
233) 15) dialog: No.
233) 17) dialog: I know you’re supposed to feel something. But I guess the fact that I’m here talking to you - that’s something... I guess. It’s a different world where I’m from. There are things you have to do. That's the life you’re in. You give your word. You do the wrong thing you gotta pay - You don’t know...
233) 19) dialog: No, they deserved it.
233) 21) dialog: Water under the dam.
233) 23) dialog: I didn’t know their families. Except one... Silence as Frank regards the photo that’s now on top in his hands: One of Jimmy and Frank taken at Frank Sheeran Appreciation Night.
233) 24) dialog: Did I have any choice?
233) 26) dialog: Let’s put it this way, if I didn’t do it, nothing was gonna change. They would've done it anyway. And then done it to me, too... What kind of man makes a phone call like that?
233) 28) dialog: That’s all I can tell ya. It kills Frank to keep looking at the photograph of Jimmy, but he forces himself to for several more moments. Nothing can dull the guilt he feels for what he did to Jimmy, and as the priest studies him, he thinks he sees something in Frank that was hidden before. Not just remorse, but some faint remnant of humanity.
233) 30) dialog: Yes.
234) 0) text: Frank sits in his wheelchair in his room, hooked up to a trolley IV, a few faded snapshots in his lap. A young nurse opens the door and comes in to check the IV and take his vitals. As she does it -
234) 1) dialog: This is my daughter Peggy. It's the snapshot of Peggy and Jimmy at the miniature golf course. The nurse gives it a perfunctory glance.
234) 4) dialog: She hasn’t been around much. 142 The nurse cuffs his arm to check his blood pressure. And, just making conversation, like she does with all patients -
234) 6) dialog: I have four daughters.
234) 9) dialog: Who’s that? You really don’t know? She takes a closer look at the picture.
234) 10) dialog: That's Jimmy Hoffa.
234) 12) dialog: You only know how fast time goes when you get there. She’s used to old people saying things that make no sense, and says as much -
234) 14) dialog: Did I have any choice? She gives him the kind of ‘shhh’ you give your kid to comfort their crying. But it’s not that. 143
234) 18) dialog: I’m here. The nurse smiles and we follow her as she heads out into the corridor.
235) 0) text: We follow action in the corridor as we begin to hear the priest giving absolution. Day changes to night. From out in the corridor we're only allowed a partial view into Frank’s room, and even that is intermittently obscured by nurses in white coming past. It's as if what’s going on in there is too sacred to intrude on, the priest’s hands extending over Frank’s head, giving him absolution, the words only sometimes audible over the routine hospital sounds.
235) 2) dialog: Amen. INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - FRANK’S ROOM - NIGHT We find our way back into Frank's room. 144
235) 5) dialog: His mercy endures forever.
235) 7) dialog: Amen. The priest readies to leave.
235) 9) dialog: It’s Christmas?
235) 11) dialog: Okay. I ain’t going nowhere. The priest heads out.
235) 12) dialog: Father, could you do me a favor? Don’t close the door all the way. I don’t like that. Leave it open a little.
