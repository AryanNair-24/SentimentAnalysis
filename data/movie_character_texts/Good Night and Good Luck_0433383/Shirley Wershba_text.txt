17) 44) dialog: “We can’t say we were surprised at Edward R. Murrow's ‘Hate McCarthy’ telecast last evening. When his explosively one sided propaganda edited with deviously clever selectivity from McCarthy’s March against Communism was finished last evening, by equally Machiavellian coincidence the following telecast featured Murrow’s "PM” protege Hollenbeck. In an obviously gloating mood, Hollenbeck hoped viewers had witnessed his patrons triumph from and for the left.” The room is getting quieter, the mood much less jubilant.

The worst offenders on lesser levels have been quietly pushed out of the company... Don Hollenbeck, a graduate of the demised pinko publication “PM” attacked conservative newspapers with sly and slanted propaganda... he then proceeded through an equally tilted review of the day's events with McCarthy dominating his words, actions, attitude and camera... it’s O'Brian. scorr Is that gramatically correct?
