She keeps her teeth in that glass. She’s grouchy, angry, rude, never tips and has more chest hair than Rin Tin Tin. A beat as Charlie considers this.
25) 11) dialog: Sink the soldier all you want, there's no way this chick is getting married. If she were the last woman on Earth, humanity would come to a screeching halt.

Suddenly -- Ah-haiii Stu pulls out an unmarked DV tape safely tucked into an old tube sock. He puts the tape into the machine -- all smiles and press PLAY. ON THE SCREEN -- we see Cam and Charlie’s home-made sex t (SCREENWRITER’S NOTE: I don’t know if you’ve ever videota yourself having sex, but let me tell you from experience, isn’t pretty. Most home-made tapes fall into the genre of “Porn-Horror”). As the credits continue to roll, we see out-of-focus shot and incredibly embarrassing moments from Cam and Charlie’ “magical” night. The beautifully shot “movie” version was nothing close to what really happened. Some of the moment include: -- Having forgotten it was laundry day, Cam realizes (too late) that she is wearing her “Granny panties”. -- At Cam’s urging, Charlie tries to “talk nasty” but has hard time getting the hang of it (ie. “Ooo, yeah, bounce boobs like a... bouncy... hippity hop... Wait, can I star over again?”) -- “Whoah, whoah, whoah... wrong hole.” -- Charlie trying to blame the “squeaky bed” for what was unquestionably flatulence. -- While reaching for lubrication (which spills EVERYWHER and makes it difficult to hold the camera), Charlie disco Cam’s stash of a zillion sex toys. 118. -- We see some CLOSE UP FOOTAGE of Cam and Charlie having (we hear them groaning in the background) that could easi be footage of INTESTINAL SURGERY on the Discovery Channel When we CUTAWAY to see Lara and Stu watching, they look t on the verge of getting sick. -- Back on the tape, we see Charlie crying after the firs round of sex, taken with emotion. Sad and pathetic. -- Round two: Charlie tries “talking nasty” again. With even less luck. “Oh, yeah, do me like... like... a thing that you do... that you really like... when you do it. Uh huh. Do me sort of like that. Okay, I give up.” -- For the final shot, the camera is CLOSE on Charlie. It clear that Cam is on top of him and they are grinding passionately. We hear her orgasming, and as she does, she DROPS THE CAMERA -- it SMACKS CHARLIE IN THE FACE. Ouch. The image FUTZES OUT, as we go...
