9) 0) text: PAUL DUNN is one of the heads of the advertising agency. He certainly holds the top position on the West Coast. His office is large. It smells of success. Obviously this is a man who has made a great deal of money and spen it where people can see it. As David enters, he sees Paul sitting behind his desk and a baldheaded gentleman, BRAD TOOLEY, seated on the couch. Brad Tooley is in his early forties, very well-dressed in the upper Eastern advertising establishment manner. As David comes in, Brad and Paul both get up.
9) 1) dialog: (his hand out- stretched) Hello, David. How are you?
9) 3) dialog: Me too.
9) 5) dialog: David, I'd like you to meet Brad Tooley.
9) 7) dialog: Brad has recently joined the agency in New York. He was one of the best men at Doyle, Dane and Bernbach. We were lucky to get him.
9) 9) dialog: David, I don't have to tell you what I think of you. You know I feel you're one of the most creative people in this company. I was telling Brad earlier the accounts you've been responsible for.
9) 12) dialog: Brad has joined this company for a very special reason. David, we're going to get Ford. David, now thinking of himself as the vice president, realizes that Ford is an account of such proportion, that the profit participation could be enormous. His eyes widen.
9) 14) dialog: Well, it finally puts us at the top of the heap.
9) 16) dialog: Just in the last few days. You're really the first to know out here. We didn't want to say anything until it was final.
9) 18) dialog: It certainly is. Now, David...
9) 20) dialog: David, you're too valuable to become vice president. I'd like you to move to New York and work under Brad. You two are going to be in charge of Ford. You're going to have to hurry, though. You start in three weeks. David is not quite sure what he's just heard. He thinks maybe he's heard a compliment. He's heard a name of a city, a car, some weeks, but he hasn't put it together. He needs to hear it again.
9) 22) dialog: No, David. I've hired Paul Shubano as vice president.
9) 26) dialog: What?
9) 28) dialog: This is not "just another" account, David.
9) 31) dialog: I didn't promise you anything.
9) 33) dialog: Well, first of all, quite frankly, he's not as clever as you. He's more of an executive type.
9) 35) dialog: You keep referring to this as "another account." It's not. It's Ford.
9) 36) text: Why don't you stop saying that? You sound like Dinah Shore. Now, damn it, look, this isn't fair. (stops for a minute; begins to laugh) Paul, if I'm working myself up and this is a joke, I'll kill you. Are they going to burst in here and say, "Surprise!"? Goddamnit. You almost had me fooled!
9) 37) dialog: No one's bursting in here, David. I'm offering you something very big.
9) 39) dialog: No.
9) 41) dialog: No.
9) 43) dialog: No.
9) 45) dialog: Don't worry about that, please? You won't lose a penny on the house. We'll take care of it. I think Ford is more important than a single family dwelling, anyway. We'll get you more than you paid for it. The important thing is that you and Brad get along.
9) 47) dialog: What do you mean, a joke?
9) 49) dialog: I didn't say a joke.
9) 51) dialog: I'd like you there in three weeks.
9) 53) dialog: This can be a stepping stone to something bigger, David.
9) 55) dialog: Well, someday you might be vice president.
9) 57) dialog: You don't have it.
9) 59) dialog: David, I can't say this again. Phil Shubano.
9) 63) dialog: My God, I thought you'd be thrilled.
9) 69) dialog: David, that's enough.
9) 71) dialog: David, the position is filled.
9) 74) dialog: I can't either. David, you're fired.
9) 76) dialog: I can see you're upset. I'll forget what you said earlier. I don't think you want to jeopardize eight years with this company.
9) 78) dialog: That's it. Get out.
9) 80) dialog: I didn't know it five years ago.
9) 82) dialog: (presses a buzzer) Get me security, please.
9) 87) dialog: (stands up) Would you escort Mr. Howard out, please?
