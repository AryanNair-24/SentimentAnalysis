43) 2) dialog: Yes sir.
43) 4) dialog: This is for your son?
43) 6) dialog: For you? Well, you have your own car? -
43) 8) dialog: Gee, I'm sorry, but it's a delivery job. You would need a car.
43) 10) dialog: A motor home?
43) 12) dialog: I don't really think that would suit this particular job. I have just a few small deliveries a day. Those things aren't too efficient and you probably wouldn't be able to pay for gas with what I'd pay you.
43) 14) dialog: Yes. Actually, my intention was to get a high school kid with a Rabbit or something. I think an older man with a motor home would be impractical for the both of us. You understand, I don't have that many deliveries. Also, you'd have trouble parking. I don't think this would work out.
43) 16) dialog: You know what I should do? I should cross out "man" and put "boy," "delivery boy" is more correct. I guess "delivery man" is misleading.
43) 18) dialog: Um, let me think. No, not in the immediate area.
43) 20) dialog: Uh, no. I don't know of any high- paying jobs anywhere in the whole country. Do you?
43) 22) dialog: Good day to you.
43) 24) dialog: Yes. Just continue down this street about half a mile. It's a small building but you can't miss it.
