14) 2) text: Toby, down and out and in his thirties, leafs through his yearbook. He reads an inscription: 'Toby, I just know you become a movie star! Please don't forget me when you make top! I will always love you - Pam'.
14) 6) dialog: Hello, is this Pam? 
14) 8) dialog: Toby Oxman. 
14) 10) dialog: Oh, fine. How are you? 
14) 12) dialog: Great! 
14) 14) dialog: That's what I was gonna ask you. 
14) 16) dialog: Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just          calling because, well, I was          wondering if you still remembered          me, which I guess you do...
14) 21) dialog: So. Look at where we are: the year  2000! Can you believe it? I mean,          did you ever think we would          actually make it?
14) 25) dialog: Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I          kind of came to terms with myself,  I realized I had done what I had          to do. And it was time to move on.
14) 28) dialog: Well, I went to law school, if you  can believe that.
14) 29) text: Mike, Toby's roommate and cameraman, enters looking for a goes to take a shower.
14) 32) dialog: Yeah, well, it was really all kind  of a joke - and a rip-off, so,          uh...so I dropped out.
14) 35) dialog: Yeah, well, then it got me          writing, so that was a good thing. 
14) 37) dialog: Well, um, I kind of let things go          on this novel I'd been really into  - I mean, the whole publishing          industry is totally corrupt. I          mean, really, it's finished.
14) 40) dialog: I worked over at a homeless          shelter for a while, drove a cab          to pay the rent, but, I mean, that  was like - I mean, I have some          dignity.  
14) 43) dialog: I'm a documentary filmmaker. 
14) 45) dialog: N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a          grant for this one project on          teenagers. Geez, remember when we          were teenagers?
14) 49) dialog: Oh, I don't remember that... 
14) 51) dialog: Well, but it was so long ago. We          were so different back then...
14) 54) dialog: Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking          for subjects for this documentary          on teenage life in suburbia. Kind          of an exploration of the mental          psyche of its mythology. I wrote          to Derrida to see if he'd like to          do the narration. But everything's  still kind of in development at          this point.
14) 57) text: TOBY(beat)
14) 61) dialog: Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me.          What about you? I'd heard through          the grapevine you were producing          movies.
14) 64) dialog: Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast          lane'?
14) 67) dialog: Yeah...So you're um...you're          married?
14) 70) dialog: Huh. Kids? 
14) 72) dialog: How many? 
14) 74) dialog: Great. How old are they? 
14) 76) dialog: Wow, that really is great. In a          few years, who knows, maybe          they'll want to be in my          documentary! Pause.
14) 80) dialog: Yeah, sure. 
14) 82) dialog: (to himself, after pause)
22) 1) text: Toby sits across from Mr Kirk.
22) 5) dialog: Well, sir...uh...I'm actually not          doing this for the money. When you  make a documentary, you do it for          many reasons, but money is          certainly not one of them.
22) 8) dialog: Well, sir, a lot has happened to          the landscape of the suburban high  school since I was a student, and          I feel it would be a valuable,          perhaps even enlightening          endeavor, to chronicle the          changes, to get intimate with the          realities kids and parents face in  American schools today.
23) 1) text: Toby pauses by the receptionist before leaving.
23) 3) dialog: Excuse me, where's the bathroom?

24) 4) dialog: No...Actually, I'm a documentary          filmmaker?
24) 8) dialog: Well, no. I'm doing one on high          school students, in fact.
24) 11) dialog: Well...it's kind of a sociological  study in the aftermath of          Columbine.
24) 14) dialog: Yeah, well, it's possible they          would be interested in it. 
24) 16) dialog: Actually, there is some interest          from the Sundance Channel.
24) 19) dialog: HBO and MTV have also shown some          interest. 
25) 3) dialog: You see, we're trying to do a film  on suburban lifestyles...

26) 12) dialog: Scooby and a few other students of  different socioeconomic          backgrounds.
26) 24) dialog: Well, I suppose I could          reconceive...
26) 27) dialog: 'Cause Scooby does have a quality          that I've been looking for, a          quality that is emblematic of          American today. It's part          disillusionment, part hope...
26) 37) dialog: Oh, I know, I know that. Well,          sharing your story, your ups and          downs, and so  forth, can I hope, be an          illuminating experience. 
26) 40) dialog: Mr Livingston, I fully understand          and I share your concerns. You          fell vulnerable. And I know that          this is a very difficult question,  but what it comes down to is: can          you make a leap of faith in me, in  the same way that I have to make a  leap of faith in you? 
26) 43) text: Big Esposito, in football attire, surrounded by Brady and athletes, talks to Toby. Kids whip towels at each other i background.
26) 49) dialog: Walking down these hallways just          like the ones I once walked down          as a teenager, I couldn't help          thinking back to a time when every  day I woke up depressed, suicidal,  consumed by despair. Had things          changed? Was the competition to          get into the most prestigious          schools still a requisite rite of          passage? Beneath these masks of          courtesy and friendliness I knew          that there were darker forces at          work...and I knew that Scooby was          the key to revealing the truth...
26) 54) dialog: Scooby, Scooby, Scooby...What are          you thinking? College, SATs, your          parents, your brothers, your          friends...How is it you deal with          all this stress?
26) 61) dialog: Is that right?

27) 1) text: Toby and his editor examine the footage on an AVID.
27) 3) dialog: So whaddya think? 
27) 5) dialog: I'm not making fun. I'm showing it  as it really is.
27) 8) dialog: No, but I like my subject. I like          these people.
27) 11) dialog: Yes, I do. I love them! 
27) 15) dialog: Thanks. I'll tell Mike. (beat)

32) 1) text: Toby and Mike are interviewing Brady and Cheryl in the dr the side, Mikey tries hypnotizing a cat.
32) 3) dialog: So are you surprised that Scooby          took the SATs after all?
32) 6) dialog: OK. How about you, Cheryl? Were          you surprised?
32) 9) dialog: Hmm. 
32) 13) dialog: (joins their laughter)
36) 30) dialog: When the sky is clear and the sun          is warm, you're reminded of how          beautiful things can be: a lamp          post, a sign, a straw wrapper          blowing in the windВ…But when that          dark cloud appears, you realize          how fragile the balance of life          is.
36) 45) dialog: But what about Scooby? How would          this effect him? What meaning is          to be found in this? 
37) 1) text: Toby and his editor finish watching this latest footage.
37) 4) dialog: You think so? You don't think that  this might not be a little dry?
37) 8) dialog: Yes, I knowВ…But still, it should          be somewhat entertaining. 
37) 12) dialog: No, no, no. No exploitation. This          is seriousВ…But don't you find it a  little funny too, at the same          time?
37) 16) dialog: Nothing, I guessВ… 
37) 19) dialog: OK, you're right, you're rightВ… (beat)
37) 24) dialog: OK, then we can invite serious          intellectual types.
37) 27) dialog: Hip alternative types who will          understand the process betterВ…
37) 30) dialog: Well, I need to see this with an          audience!
37) 34) dialog: I don't know. Maybe they'll like          it.
41) 7) dialog: So where'd you get in? 
41) 9) dialog: (beat)

52) 39) dialog: Uh, Scooby, now I understand how          you want to be a TV talk-show host  and all, like Conan O'Brien, but          did you know even he went to          college?
52) 42) dialog: Yeah. He went to Harward.
