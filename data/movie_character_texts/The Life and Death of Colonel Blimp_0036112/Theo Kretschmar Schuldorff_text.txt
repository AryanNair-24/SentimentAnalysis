The general effect serious, even solemn. Depression bangs over the stiff-nec assembly. CLIVE comes down from the house, walking quickl looking about him for THEO. He comes among the groups of officers. Nobody takes direc notice of him. The orchestra starts to tune up. People start to move bac to their places. CLIVE stops one group and addresses a senior officer.
0) 797) text: He moves off. CLIVE whirls round.  He stands directly in between THEO and his place. THEO is advancing straight towards him, separated by two or three groups, also moving to their places. Seeing CLIVE, THEO stops. Not a muscle of his face or lig in his eyes betrays his thoughts. CLIVE, on the contrary, advances with a broad smile that  overflows his whole being. He is coming to his friend. He puts out his hand...

THEO throws away his cigarette, treads on it and returns his place in the audience. Nearly everyone has settled  himself. CLIVE is left standing alone. [[The Conductor takes his place amid polite applause.]] [The music starts again.] CLIVE shakes his head as if he still can't believe what h happened to him. He looks ten years older. He turns and slowly walks away. THEO never looks after him. The orchestra plays the opening chords of [[Beethoven's F Symphony]] [Mendelssohn's Hebrides Overture].  CLIVE goes towards the house. He again shakes his head. For the seco time, there is something 'blimpish' in his behaviour. He stops and looks back, almost as if he is expected to s the figure of his friend, hastening after him.  But the l between him and the distant audience is empty.
