He turns and slowly walks away. THEO never looks after him. The orchestra plays the opening chords of [[Beethoven's F Symphony]] [Mendelssohn's Hebrides Overture].  CLIVE goes towards the house. He again shakes his head. For the seco time, there is something 'blimpish' in his behaviour. He stops and looks back, almost as if he is expected to s the figure of his friend, hastening after him.
