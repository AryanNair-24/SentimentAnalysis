Then, party as hardest. Yes? But, she offers no time for them to answer or process... CHARLOTTE (CONT’D) Yes! Okay. Now. Restaurant recommendations. Around the centre you will find quite fine dining, quite upmarket. And in the sauna. She pronounces it Scandinavian style ‘sow-nah’. CHARLOTTE (CONT’D) In Europe it’s considered unhygienic to sauna in your swim suits. So, please, the body is not to be ashamed of, yes?

49) 3) dialog: Have you had a varied life of No, I’m not asking so you’1 sexual---? repeat it--- Billie glances at the Senior Skiers, self-conscious.
49) 4) dialog: (re: Skiers) At that age, they rarely bother with English. It seems true, at this moment. None of them are paying attention, involved in their own conversations. And, all German.
49) 6) dialog: I'm sorry, it’s just - I don’t like so much bullshit all the time. For the first time, Billie really hears something from Charlotte that resonates for her. CHARLOTTE (CONT’D) I don’t see the point of bullshit.

Oh my goodness, what shall we do! God is angry in his heaven! The marriage must be over, the special parts have rubbed! (the slightly alarming act is over) It’s superstition.
