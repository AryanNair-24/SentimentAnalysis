80) 0) text: The CHIEF NURSE, a large, dynamic woman in her 50's, face Betty across her desk.
80) 1) dialog: Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
80) 3) dialog: Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
80) 5) dialog: I don't think I know that hospital.
80) 7) dialog: Really? You've just described all of Southern California. The Chief Nurse looks at Betty for a moment, then stands abruptly, signaling the end of the interview. 67.
80) 8) dialog: (cont'd) Well, I'm sorry, but I can't even consider you without references or a resume. And frankly, I don't know how you could have forgotten them.
84) 4) dialog: That's Betty Sagamore. I hired her today.
87) 0) text: The Chief Nurse sits behind her desk. Betty faces her like a student in the principal's office, now dressed in her whi waitress uniform. She hopes no one notices.
87) 1) dialog: What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here? 73.
87) 3) dialog: Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear? (Betty nods) Fine... The Chief Nurse gets up, and Betty follows suit.
87) 4) dialog: (cont'd) You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone. (studying Betty's uniform) Is that issue?
87) 6) dialog: Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
