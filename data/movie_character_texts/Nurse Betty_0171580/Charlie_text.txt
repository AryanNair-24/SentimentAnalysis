26) 16) dialog: Could you give us an example?
26) 18) dialog: I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
26) 20) dialog: You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
26) 22) dialog: I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.

26) 27) dialog: Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?
26) 30) dialog: That's what I thought. (to Del) You better give me another example.
26) 36) dialog: You did not just say "Injuns," Del.

You agree that you were stupid? Del nods again. Wesley collects Charlie's glass and mixes him another drink. He gets a beer for himself and stands behind Del. Charlie sips his drink slowly, savoring it. CHARLIE (cont'd) You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is - you'd have been scalped.

Charlie walks into the kitchen for another drink. CHARLIE (cont'd) I'll tell you, if anyone got a raw deal it's the American Indian. This country has a black mark on its soul for what was done to them. Wesley's nostrils flare. Betty leans forward. CHARLIE (cont'd) I'm all for them owning casinos, getting 30 31 rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley? 29.

Then you figured you'd take this valuable commodity and go into business yourself, even though it didn't belong to you. But you needed a crackerjack salesman to move it, so you made the biggest mistake of your short life and chose Del. Sound right so far? Duane nods. CHARLIE (cont'd) Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
53) 3) dialog: Exactly. (BEAT)

Wesley finally looks up, directly at the picture of Betty CHARLIE (cont'd) Did you hear what I said? Wesley nods, his mouth stuffed with food. CHARLIE (cont'd) Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.

74) 12) dialog: You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole.

We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg. Charlie pulls out the close-up photo and studies it. CHARLIE (cont'd) Betty, Betty, Betty...
