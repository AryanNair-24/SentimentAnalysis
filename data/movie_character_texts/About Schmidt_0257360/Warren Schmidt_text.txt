(the words tasting of metal) From what I’ve seen, Jeannie, I’m betting you and Randall will have as happy a marriage as Helen and I did. I recall the day Jeannie first told us she had been proposed to. We hadn’t yet met this Randall fellow, so we were understandably a little suspicious. Later she brought him home for Christmas so we could get a look at him. I remember there was a big snowstorm. Randall here helped me shovel off the front walk. He pitched right in. Randall beams and nods and jokingly flexes a muscle for t benefit of the crowd. WARREN (CONT’D) But that brings me to what I really wanted to say. What I want to say is that, uh. Thank you to you, Randall, for taking such good care of my daughter, especially recently with our loss. Ever since I arrived here on Thursday afternoon, just two days ago, I’ve so enjoyed getting to know Jeannie’s new family here in Denver.
