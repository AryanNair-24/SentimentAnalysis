11) 16) dialog: Eight...zero...

In a much needed moment of levity, David grabs Corey’s ha too. Huddles them together with his and Emily's. But, the moment is fleeting. Somber looks soon appear on their faces. Their trembling hands lower and separate. Their eyes divert. They're freezing to death. They clearly know it, too. Just then, a faint light shines across the parking lot, n the supermarket. David, Corey and Emily turn to face it.

13) 26) dialog: Both of you, please, just...leave me alone. She shivers in the cold. Hugs her arms close to her body. David and Corey speak quietly to each other.
13) 33) dialog: Do we have any more plants?

13) 43) dialog: David!! The Man’s fingers RAKE across David's eyes. PULL at his h and skin. The entire battle is awkwardly primordial. No skill whatsoever; only pure survival instinct. With the Man’s hands now GRABBING at his throat, David notices the pen -- hanging from a thin, steel cable wire attached to the signing shelf above -- dangling in front him. His eyes widen. He frees one of his hands, which is tangled up in the struggle. Grabs the pen. Wraps the steel wire around the Man's throat. Takes hold of the wire with both hands -- -- and PULLS with all his might. Pushing off with his fee for leverage, against the Man’s body. The Man’s hands instantly raise to his throat. He writhes and thrashes like a fish on a boat deck. Desperately trie to squeeze his fingers beneath the wire. His face turns color. Red first, then blue. The veins in his forehead and neck look as if they are about to burst. David bares his clenched teeth, holding on with all his strength. The Man’s legs kick uncontrollably, more and more...until -- he succumbs to asphyxiation. He stops moving.

13) 46) dialog: Is he...? Still laboring to catch his breath, David responds with a uneasy nod. Corey lets out a long sigh. His lungs are also on fire fr the encounter. He takes off his collared dress shirt, leaving him in a T-shirt. He holds the collared shirt to bloody nose.
13) 47) dialog: What...what do we do now?
13) 49) dialog: We have to tell the police.
13) 52) dialog: Yeah. Are you?

13) 57) dialog: What did you do?
13) 66) dialog: Using the ATM. David looks over to see Emily holding Harold’s ATM card. David leans back against the frosty glass. Sits down. His head falls into his trembling hands.
13) 71) dialog: He’s innocent... (sotto, but loud enough for them to hear) Just like we are. Corey and David are quickly sobered by this statement. A moments of silence pass before David breaks it.
13) 91) dialog: Stop! Stop it! David pushes Corey back against the wall. Corey responds SHOVING David hard to his chest.
13) 96) dialog: He’s gone again. 70. David doesn’t bother to look. Neither does Corey. Their disdainful gazes are locked on each other.
13) 101) dialog: What are you going to do?

13) 126) dialog: Don’t look. Emily's fearful pleas give David pause. But, David has to look. He slowly turns to face the vestibule door. Outside, he s Corey's dead, bloody body lying on the cold concrete. The screwdriver still sticking from his stomach. David's hands tremble. His breathing borders on hyperventilation. Nearing a breakdown, David's feet move backwards. Slowly. Further and further away from the door. His back soon touches the plaster wall. Collapses onto it
13) 132) dialog: Why?
13) 134) dialog: For what?
13) 136) dialog: Don’t be.
13) 138) dialog: David...
13) 140) dialog: You're right. It is. 75. David looks at Emily. Surprised by her concurrence.
13) 141) dialog: It’s all of our fault. Emily sets adrift in thought.
13) 142) dialog: We've been in here for hours now trying to control what’s happening to us. Waiting for...a reason. (beat) What, because we didn’t do anything wrong we’re somehow supposed to be protected? By who? The police? Alarms? Little visor clips with angels on them? (beat) If there is a reason this is happening, it’s because we never thought it could. David takes a moment to consider this.
13) 144) dialog: I could have taken a cab. I could have skipped the party. I could have never worked at Starkweather in the first place. But, I did all those things, and a million, random things in between, and added up they all brought me here tonight...with you. David looks up at Emily.
13) 145) dialog: Although, given what’s happened, lunch would have probably been a better choice. David ekes out a smile. He pulls Emily closer. They tight their embrace.
13) 155) dialog: see the Man. They panic.
13) 156) dialog: There he is!! 78.
13) 159) dialog: pull Corey with all their collective might. David’s legs tangled with Corey’s. He stumbles.

13) 192) dialog: I have to put pressure on it! Emily presses the shirt down on Corey’s wound, trying to stabilize his bleeding. More blood oozes out. Corey responds weakly. It’s clear he’s fading fast. The blood soaks through the shirt, drenching it.
13) 194) dialog: How?
13) 199) dialog: What are you doing? David picks up the metal waste basket. Takes firm hold of it. Without even a moment of hesitation -- WHACK! WHACK! WHACK!

13) 211) dialog: Stop it! David stuffs Corey’s discarded, bloody shirt into the met grate covering the vent. It does little to stop the heavy flow of water. He winces in pain as the cold water stings his shivering, purple hands. The water splashes all over him, soaking hi clothes. An inch of water has already filled the vestibule. Some leaks out from underneath the door and windows -- but not much.

Carefully grabs around his neck. Tries to climb on top of him. With one hand still balancing the waste basket on the sig table, David uses the other to help Emily climb. Emily's foot slips off David’s thigh. She loses her balan but manages to stay on the signing shelf. Corey emits a pained moan, which instantly turns into a m spiral in the cold air.

Her head SMASHES against the half of the signi shelf that did not collapse. She SPLASHES into the water. Clouds of crimson spill from her head, clouding the water which she now floats.
