Or, better described, being talked to. His tie unloosened, his hair mussed, he fails in his effo to keep stress at bay.
2) 1) dialog: (into phone) Right...I understand. But, there’s so many variables that come into play in a market like this. The voice from the other end of the phone is unintelligib but its tone is unmistakably hostile.
2) 2) dialog: If you'd like, we can explore shifting what's left in your 401K into...I see. COREY THOMPSON, 28, David’s somewhat overbearing and audacious friend and coworker, overhears the conversation Tunes in.

2) 7) dialog: What gave it away? David powers down his computer. Corey takes a candy cane off David’s desk. Tears open the plastic wrapper. Pops it into his mouth.
2) 9) dialog: I wouldn’t know. Corey smirks. David looks at himself in the reflection of his powered d computer monitor. His button-down shirt. His loosened tie His messy hair. Corey notices his dejected expression.
2) 11) dialog: (sarcastically) Oh no, who’s fault is it then? (sincere now) I’ve never even met this guy. Just moved some numbers around on the computer and now he’s fucked.

2) 30) dialog: Because...I left my balls at home.
2) 32) dialog: Yup, right there on the dresser.

3) 26) dialog: Yeah. Corey told me you got a job at an NPO.
3) 28) dialog: Well, congrats. Needed a change, I guess.
3) 30) dialog: I know what you mean. Neither of them seems to know where to go from here. The extended silence is a bit awkward.

4) 12) dialog: Nervous? About what?
4) 14) dialog: Really?
4) 16) dialog: We've talked plenty of times before. Wearing only his button-down work shirt, the cold is alre taking its toll on David. He folds his arms for warmth. Tries to rub life back into his limbs.
4) 18) dialog: I never cared about the reports. They smile at each other. Their breath escapes into the c nighttime air. A cab speeds past. Emily misses the chance to signal it. Standing in the spot she stood moments ago are two women. The cab stops for them and they climb in.
4) 20) dialog: I can give you a ride home. Emily considers it, but then:
4) 22) dialog: Come on, it’s freezing out here. I‘1l grab my jacket and we'll go. More cold wind blows through. It chills them to the bone. 13.

5) 3) dialog: (re: the cell phone) Let me see it. 16. David reaches his hand behind him, but Corey throws the p over David’s shoulder, onto the front seat. It lands on t floor, in a small crevice on the side of the seat.

6) 0) text: Large and dark, the lot is a vast expanse of empty area. Yellow lines demarcate the hundreds of parking spaces, th none are occupied. It’s quite barren. Eerie. Not the best part of town, either. The supermarket is closed for the night. A long, frozen, industrial hose snakes from the building to the rows of Douglas-fir trees lined near its entrance. The trees’ chilled limbs dance in the strong winds. Festooned above them, a large banner reads: “CHRISTMAS TR FOR SALE.” Nearby, beneath the supermarket’s main sign, is a large t and temperature sign. Current time: 1:18am. Temperature: negative 3 degrees Fahrenheit. Across from the supermarket, in a remote area of the park lot, sits a standalone ATM vestibule owned by BANK OF THE MIDWEST.

7) 8) dialog: Well that was -- okay, I was a little nervous then, but...
7) 11) dialog: Oh, it’s nothing. Emily leans in and reads the inscription. Her shoulder touches David’s. Her touch electrifies him.
7) 13) dialog: It’s stupid. I don’t know why I even have it.
7) 15) dialog: (re: Corey) Uggg...what is it now? Corey turns to face them. Throws his hands up in resigned defeat.
7) 16) dialog: You've got to be kidding me. David gets out of the car. Leaves his jacket behind on Emily's lap. Jogs over to the ATM vestibule. WE STAY ON EMILY as she watches David using his own ATM c to let himself into the vestibule. He and Corey have a br discussion, ending with David’s obvious displeasure. Emily looks around while holding her cold hands closer to heat. The emptiness and dark surroundings make her visibl uneasy. 21. After a moment, she turns off the car. Removes the keys f the ignition. Still wearing her coat, she exits the car a hurries over the ATM. WE SEE that she left behind her pur Corey opens the door and lets her into...

8) 14) dialog: No, wait...
8) 16) dialog: Just wait. Corey stands down. The three of them stare outside at the Man. He stares back.
8) 17) dialog: Why’s he out there?
8) 21) dialog: Damn it, Corey. Wait. Corey stops. Let’s out an annoyed sigh.
8) 25) dialog: What if he wants to rob us? 24.
8) 27) dialog: Corey, it’s one in the morning. Why would this guy be in the middle of an empty parking lot?
8) 29) dialog: Did we walk here? Alone? Corey looks at the Man for a beat. Considers David's assertion. After a beat:
8) 38) dialog: Corey, no. Corey knocks on the glass. Calls out to the Man.
8) 42) dialog: Probably our money. (beat) Does he have anything on him? Can you see?

8) 54) dialog: He doesn’t look homeless.
8) 56) dialog: When they’re that big. Just then, the Man’s head WHIPS around. A faint jingling sound grows louder and louder. Someone’s coming.
8) 66) dialog: Hey! Hey!!
8) 73) dialog: Damn it! (to Emily and Corey) Call nine-one-one. Call them! Corey throws his hands up. He doesn’t have his phone, remember? David looks to Emily. She sheepishly answers.
8) 75) dialog: Where’s your purse? Emily looks outside.
8) 79) dialog: Shit, what about a hard line?

Her teeth chatter behind her dry, pallid lip She can’t take her frightened eyes off the Man, who slowl circles the vestibule like a shark. A predator.
10) 1) dialog: There has to be something. Something we can do to, I don’t know, get someone’s attention.
10) 3) dialog: There was that guy with his dog.
10) 6) dialog: Maybe he doesn’t have an ATM card.
10) 8) dialog: You need it for the buzzer thing.
10) 10) dialog: Has he checked? 31.
10) 13) dialog: Where are my keys? Emily digs into her jacket pocket. Removes David’s keys, well as a tube of lipstick. She hands David his keys.

10) 21) dialog: Shit -- I think he heard us.
10) 25) dialog: No...I can’t tell. I think he went around back. Shit. David peels away from the window.
10) 29) dialog: (to Emily, hushed) Your cell phone...you’re positive it’s in your purse? Emily nods.

10) 37) dialog: No, it’s not.

10) 49) dialog: Wait...wait-wait-wait...
10) 52) dialog: The glass -- there’s got to be an alarm on it or something. David bangs harder, all to no avail. 36.
10) 54) dialog: All right...then something else. David looks around the vestibule. His eyes lock on the plaster wall. He KICKS at it. Repeatedly. Frantically. It dents. Deforms. Cory joins in. SMASHES his shoulder into the plaster wall over and over again. Pieces of drywall fall to the ground. But still, no alarm
10) 55) dialog: Damn it!! Emily's eyes drift upward. Something catches her attentio
10) 57) dialog: What?
10) 60) dialog: Shit. No. (to Corey) You? Corey shakes his head “No.” Out of breath, David looks at the ATM itself. Without any hesitation, he storms over to it. WHAM!! He delivers a KICK right at it. Nothing. 37. INSERT - The ATM's silent, black and white security camer

10) 73) dialog: (to Corey) How much do you have in your account?
10) 75) dialog: I’ve got close to three grand. David approaches the ATM. Inserts his card. Punches buttons.
10) 77) dialog: He just fucking beat a guy to death, Corey. If it means us getting out of here alive, absolutely. Something’s wrong.
10) 78) dialog: Damn...
10) 80) dialog: (re: the ATM) It‘ll only let me take out four hundred.
10) 82) dialog: I already took out a hundred. There’s a daily limit. 39. David goes forward with the withdrawal anyway.
10) 83) dialog: (to Corey) You take out five hundred, too. Maybe a thousand will be enough. David grabs his cash. Takes back his ATM card.
10) 85) dialog: Shit. That’s right. David gives Corey a once-over. Notices his watch.
10) 86) dialog: What about that?
10) 88) dialog: Your watch.
10) 91) dialog: (to Corey) It’s just a watch, Corey.

10) 101) dialog: Please tell me you were just being cheap.
10) 103) dialog: Your card works fine. You were just too cheap to take out money, right, Corey? Corey finally gets it, evidenced by his sudden look of disquietude. 41.
10) 104) dialog: Corey...? He slowly shakes his head to say “No.” David and Emily look at each other. Fear stains their fac David takes slow, trepidant steps over to the vestibule d He looks at it. Terrified. He slowly extends his tremblin hand until his fingertips make contact with the icy glass Without pressing the EXIT LEVER, he gently, and ever so slightly, pushes the glass door itself -- -- and it OPENS. A chilling wind whistles in through the small space. His outstretched hand quivers. The locking mechanism on t door is clearly broken. In short: The door is unlocked. David looks outside for the Man. He’s nowhere in sight. B still, did he see this? David nervously pulls back his hand, closing the barely- opened vestibule door. He backs away. After a beat, David signals to Corey. “Give it.” Corey removes his wristwatch. Hands it to David. David approaches a signing shelf, affixed to one of the g walls of the vestibule. He grabs an ATM deposit envelope. Reaching into his pocket, he removes all his cash. Stuffs into the envelope. Same for Corey’s watch and Emily’s earrings. Seals the envelope. His cold, shaking hands make these fi movements difficult. David signals Emily and Corey over. They huddle around hi He holds the deposit envelope in hand.
10) 105) dialog: I’m going to slide this to the side of him -- away from the door. If he goes for it, we run the other way, toward the main road. 42.

10) 113) dialog: Emily’s right, it’s too risky.
10) 117) dialog: I’1l go alone.
10) 120) dialog: I’m not stranding anybody. If I make it to the car, I can go get help. The Man quietly places the tools on the ground. Walks to side of the brick wall. Peers around it. Waits.
10) 123) text: And then, from out of the shadows, he emerges. Standing approximately twenty feet in front of David, his heavy breaths escape from the hood of his parka. David holds out the envelope.
10) 124) dialog: There’s...there’s five hundred dollars in here...plus, everything we have. A pair of earrings, a watch. It’s yours, all of it. Please...just let us go. The Man doesn’t react. He just continues to stare. Corey and Emily watch, nervously, from behind the glass. The bitter cold stings David’s cheeks, transforming his breath into vapor.
10) 125) dialog: We won’t tell the police about any of this. We’ve never even seen your face, so...so you can just take this... David slides the envelope full of valuables across the concrete, off to the side -- away from the door.
10) 126) dialog: .»-and...you know, disappear. Like nothing happened. Okay? Is that...is that okay? The Man is yet to move. Silence. The tension is palpable. And then, after a long beat -- -- the Man takes a step in the direction the envelope. Finally, a glimmer of hope. Step by lumbering step, the Man gets closer to the envelo and further away from David. And the car. David surreptitiously removes his car keys from his pocke Waits the for the right moment to make his move. Waits... Waits...... Waits........ 45. Now!

11) 4) dialog: There’s a...a room or something.
11) 6) dialog: Yeah. It’s small. It must be where they go to restock the ATM.
11) 9) dialog: (re: the vent) There’s no way she’s fitting through this. David's right. The vent is far too small. Corey looks up at the cracks and dents made earlier in th plaster wall. Digs his fingers in. Pulls. His tired, frozen muscles keep him from mustering up any real streng Finally, a sizeable chunk of drywall falls to the floor, exposing a brick wall behind it.

11) 56) dialog: Emily, this guy isn’t doing all this because I lost his money. If that were the case, why would he kill the dog guy? It doesn’t make sense.
11) 59) dialog: It’s isolated. Open all night. Only one way in or out. And there’s a box full of money in it. (beat) It’s the perfect human trap.

13) 14) dialog: Watch out -- there’s someone out there. Emily opens the door enough to lean outside. The Midwestern wind howls madly.
13) 23) dialog: Are you okay? Emily? She doesn’t answer.
13) 28) dialog: I know, I know...
13) 30) dialog: (overlapping) No --
13) 32) dialog: Who's going to play the bait? You? Because I’m sure as hell not going to again. Corey sighs. Frustrated. Still huddled in the corner:
13) 34) dialog: (confused) What?
13) 37) dialog: It’s hypothermia. We can’t stay here much longer.
13) 40) dialog: Emily!! David LUNGES forward, BLOCKING the Man from Emily, who he nearest. He GRABS the Man by his thick jacket and SLAMS h against the plaster wall.
13) 42) dialog: Grab him!! Corey shakes it off. Blood spills from his nose. He JUMPS back on top of the Man, rejoining David in the struggle. GRABS the Man by the hair, lifts his head -- -- SLAM-SLAM-SLAM. Against the wall, just beneath the signing shelf. The Man screams out in pain. Blood stains his hair. Still, he fights back. Grabs at David’s face an neck. 63.
13) 50) dialog: Yeah. We will. Let’s just get out of here first. David climbs to his feet. Corey does the same.
13) 51) dialog: (to Emily) You okay?
13) 53) dialog: I think so. (to Corey) How's your nose. Corey doesn’t answer. He slowly lowers the shirt from his nose. His dilated eyes stare straight ahead.
13) 54) dialog: (to Corey) Hey...? You all right?
13) 56) dialog: What...? How’s he...?
13) 58) dialog: I didn’t do anything. He...he was going to kill us!
13) 60) dialog: I don’t know. I thought...you did, too.
13) 62) dialog: What are you doing?
13) 65) dialog: (reading) Harold Westbrook. Eight Frederick Street. Date of birth: five, nineteen, sixty-eight. (beat) What the hell was he doing here?
13) 68) dialog: He’s got a wife...kids.
13) 70) dialog: For Christ's sake, Corey, the guy’s a fucking janitor. He was on his way to work. Emily places the ATM card on the floor and moves back.
13) 72) dialog: (re: Harold, dejected) Not anymore. David looks at Emily. His guilt is palpable. Corey can’t fight it anymore. He knows they’re right. He kicks over the metal waste basket. Paper flies everywhere.
13) 75) dialog: You had to make me stop. You couldn't just go home... 68.
13) 77) dialog: It is your fault!
13) 80) dialog: You did! The Man flips open the toolbox. Grabs the spool of metal wire.
13) 84) dialog: I did say no. Twice. But as usual, you didn’t give a shit.
13) 86) dialog: Mine? David leaps to his feet.
13) 88) dialog: Fuck you. 69.
13) 92) dialog: (to Corey) You did it, too!
13) 97) dialog: He’s out there. Somewhere. It’s clear that Corey’s reached a breaking point.
13) 99) dialog: It’s the only option we have.
13) 103) dialog: That’s what he wants you to do --
13) 109) dialog: Enough with the tough guy rou -- Wait...what?!!  Corey’s BURSTS out of the vestibule door!
13) 110) dialog: Corey, no!!
13) 113) dialog: No!
13) 118) dialog: No!! Nol!!! The Man looks over at David and Emily. He calmly pulls ou SCREWDRIVER from inside his parka. David's eyes widen as he sees the screwdriver. He tries t exit the vestibule to help his friend, but Emily grabs ho of him. She hangs on with all her might.
13) 119) dialog: No!! Corey!!!
13) 121) dialog: Let me go!!
13) 123) dialog: No it’s not! Let me go! David opens the door and pushes free of Emily. Harder tha he probably intended. She falls backward, tripping over Harold’s legs and SLAMMING her head onto the cold floor. Seeing this, David stops. Closes the door and rushes to h side.
13) 124) dialog: Shit! I’m sorry! Emily...!
13) 127) dialog: This can’t...this can’t be happening... He rubs at his eyes, his temples. His hands wring his mus hair. His whole body shakes. He falls apart. Emily waits a moment before approaching him. Sits down ne to him. She holds him; he holds her. They shiver in the unyielding cold.
13) 131) dialog: The hat...I knew it wasn’t yours. I grabbed it off the back of someone’s chair.
13) 133) dialog: (shrugs ) I was desperate.
13) 135) dialog: For a way to keep you from leaving. (beat) I wish I had just let you go. I’m so sorry.
13) 137) dialog: You should be home right now.
13) 139) dialog: It’s my fault. An unsettling realization occurs to Emily.
13) 143) dialog: Still, you shouldn't be here.
13) 146) dialog: I’ve wanted to be this close to you for so long. Emily's head falls to David’s chest, against his T-shirt. Her chin slowly rises. 76. Tears trickle over her lips as they draw nearer to David' And then, suddenly --
13) 150) dialog: Christ... Emily turns to see what David is looking at. It’s Corey. He’s ash-white. Bleeding profusely. The screwdriver still stuck in his stomach. Corey's quivering arms drag himself across the parking lo toward the ATM vestibule. A trail of smeared blood follow him. Emily is about to say something -- or scream -- when Davi pulls her close to him. Covers her mouth. 77. Puts a finger to his mouth. Shhhhhhhh. A cloud of smoke accentuates his silent directive. He points at the plaster wall, referring to the Man. Emil gets it -- she nods. David removes his hand from her mouth. David quietly opens the vestibule door. Exits. Emily exit with him to...
13) 152) dialog: (hushed) Okay. Come on. They move Corey back toward the vestibule, trying not to a sound. His rag doll legs noisily drag across the ground
13) 153) dialog: (hushed) Hurry... They continue to drag Corey. Blood spills from his open wound. They’re halfway there, when --
13) 155) dialog: see the Man. They panic.
13) 157) dialog: Go-go-go!! They pull with all their might, as fast as their frozen, fatigued bodies will allow.
13) 159) dialog: pull Corey with all their collective might. David’s legs tangled with Corey’s. He stumbles.
13) 162) dialog: call upon every last bit of strength they possess.
13) 163) dialog: Get the door!! I’ve got him -- get the door!!
13) 165) dialog: grabs Corey under both arms from behind. Lifts him a bit higher off the ground than he previously had been. Corey lets out a pained groan.
13) 170) dialog: gives Corey one final, desperate pull, dragging him...
13) 175) dialog: Emily, what are you doing?! I need your help! Emily snaps out of it. Slowly. Still staring at the Man. After a beat, she joins David, who attends to Corey. Corey’s in worse condition than it seemed. His skin is terribly pale. His purple lips tremble. 80. Blood leaks from his stomach, through his flimsy T-shirt all over Harold's parka, which he still wears.
13) 176) dialog: (to Corey) Holy shit, holy shit. Corey? Corey? Can you hear me? Come on, buddy...please...Corey? Corey?! (to Emily) We've got to get him help.
13) 178) dialog: With what?
13) 180) dialog: I don’t have -- give me something! Emily looks around. Grabs a handful of deposit envelopes. Hands them to David.
13) 184) dialog: What do I do?!
13) 187) dialog: Should I pull it out?
13) 189) dialog: (re: the blood) It’s not stopping!
13) 191) dialog: Do it easy.
13) 193) dialog: We've got to get him to a hospital.
13) 195) dialog: I don’t know, but we have to. He’s going to bleed to death if we don’t. Corey continues to shiver. Emily takes off her coat, leaving her in her work blouse. She drapes it over Corey like a blanket. Still aiding Corey, David looks outside for the Man. nowhere in sight. 82. David turns his attention back inside the vestibule. Frantically looks everywhere for an answer.
13) 196) dialog: If we try to... David notices that Corey is starting to drift away. He gently taps his cheek to bring him back.
13) 197) dialog: (to Corey) ...whoa-whoa-whoa, Corey...Corey! Corey comes back around, albeit slightly.
13) 198) dialog: (re: the compress) Keep holding that there. David climbs to his feet. Nervously searches the vestibul
13) 202) dialog: It’ll send a signal to the police, won't it? If the ATM’s broken?
13) 204) dialog: Well, something in this thing has to! It’s owned by a God damn bank! Still tending to the rapidly fading Corey, Emily glances outside. Her mouth falls agape. David turns and sees why. The Man has rolled David’s car up against the front of th vestibule. The front bumper presses against the glass doo
13) 205) dialog: What...? David tries to open the vestibule door. Not a chance. He frantically tries again. It barely opens an inch.
13) 206) dialog: We're locked in. Corey suddenly starts to convulse.
13) 208) dialog: Grab him! Emily struggles to Keep Corey’s body under control. Blood and bile spill from the corner of his mouth.
13) 209) dialog: Corey! Come on, buddy. Please... Corey soon stops. He’s alive. Barely. His blood soaks David's clothes. David is paralyzed by his inability to do a damn thing to the situation. And then -- THERE'S WATER. It rushes through the heating vent. Fast. 84.
13) 210) dialog: Holy shit! The icy water rapidly spreads across the floor. Pools in corners.
13) 213) dialog: The signing shelf. Their feet splash through the frigid water as they strugg to carry Cory’s limp body over to the signing shelf.
13) 214) dialog: On three. One, two, three... They try to lift Corey high enough to lay him on the sign shelf, but can’t.
13) 215) dialog: Higher!
13) 217) dialog: Fuck... Emily drapes her coat over Corey once again. David approaches the door. He tries to control his erratic, irrepressibly rapid breathing. His purple lips quiver.
13) 219) dialog: Not drown us -- freeze us. The water is unremitting. Gallon after ice cold gallon spills from out of the vent, bringing the level in the vestibule just under David and Emily’s knees. Harold's corpse floats at the surface of the frigid water Holding Corey close, compressing his wound, David’s eyes frenetically dart in every direction, searching for a solution. And then, he sees something -- right in front of his face The focus of his rapt attention: a pack of cigarettes, po out of the inside pocket of Harold’s parka -- which is st being worn by Corey. David ferrets through the parka. Removes the pack of cigarettes. As he clearly hoped, a disposable lighter is also tucked away in the inside pocket. His look of hopelessness evaporates from his face, overco by an expression of nascent optimism. He then looks up at the ceiling, where he sees -- -- the FIRE SPRINKLER system, poking through various part the high ceiling. David hatches an instant plan. Potentially a good one. 86. He leaps to his feet. Climbs, with great difficulty, on t of the metal signing shelf. Tries sparking the lighter. H numb, purple hands lack the motor skills required to spin striker. He resolves to use the palm of his other hand to spin it. It only spits a few sparks. One more try. Finally, it catches. He holds the lighter over his head. But, the ceiling is far too high.
13) 220) dialog: shit!
13) 222) dialog: I know, I know... Emily sits Corey up against the wall. She then collects a many paper items as she can that have not yet gotten wet. Deposit envelopes, discarded receipts, etc. Stuffs them in the metal waste basket, which now floats o the surface of the rising water.
13) 226) dialog: That’s enough. David holds out the lighter. Again he struggles to light Spark. Spark.
13) 227) dialog: (sotto) Come on, come on... 87. Spark. Spark.
13) 228) dialog: Come on! And then, finally -- -- and it catches. He uses his other hand to shield the flame as he moves the lighter closer to the paper in the waste basket. David touches the flame to the corner of a single piece o paper. The flames quickly spread. He stuffs the lighter into his pants pocket. Within a matter of seconds, large flames jump out from th top of the waste basket.
13) 229) dialog: All right -- hold onto it. Emily takes hold of the waste basket. Watches David as th ice cold water continues to rise. He places his knee on top of the signing shelf. Reaches t grab hold of anything that can assist him in his climb -- there’s nothing. Just a blank, glass wall. Inching forward onto his butt, he manages to sit on the narrow shelf. The next step is far more difficult: standi up. He checks the status of the fire inside the waste basket. Still burning, but already showing signs of weakening. He looks over at Corey, who sits against the wall. The water up to his chest. Time is running out -- for everyone.
13) 230) dialog: Throw in more paper.
13) 232) dialog: Use it! Emily throws in the last of the paper. The fire reignites its original strength. She approaches the signing shelf. 88.
13) 234) dialog: Okay...hand it to me. Ducking away from the flames, Emily lifts up the metal wa basket.
13) 235) dialog: Careful...be careful.
13) 237) dialog: Am I near it? She shakes her head to offer a distressed “No.” David angles the waste basket so he can see for himself. He’s not even close. The ceiling is simply too high. He lets out a frustrated scream. Lowers the waste basket. Rests it on the signing shelf.
13) 241) dialog: We need more paper. Anything! Corey fades in and out of consciousness. His skin has tur an icy blue. The water level is up to his chin. Emily’s jacket, which previously draped over him like a blanket, now floats on of the water, as does his capped bottle of tequila. Emily tears cardboard Bank of the Midwest advertisements from behind their plastic shields, on the plaster wall. Hurries them over to David.
13) 245) dialog: No -- what are you doing?
13) 247) dialog: What the hell are you --
13) 249) dialog: The fire’s going out. We’re wasting time!
13) 251) dialog: What?!
13) 253) dialog: Forget it! David grabs the other side of the waste basket. Ready to lift it again.
13) 255) dialog: Forget it, Emily. It’s not working!
13) 258) dialog: I can’t get any lower without falling off.
13) 261) dialog: Okay, take it. The flames get rather close to Emily. Still, she reaches the waste basket.
13) 264) dialog: All right, rise it above you. Under one of the sprinklers. Emily spots the closest sprinkler. It’s right above her. The top of David's feet dangle precariously off the edge the shelf. His hypothermic body sways back and forth. Emily's skinny, soaking wet arms struggle to raise the me waste basket over her head.
13) 265) dialog: Higher!
13) 270) dialog: Emily!! He rushes through the water to her. Lifts her in his arms Holds her close to him. Shivers uncontrollably.
13) 271) dialog: (frantic) Oh my God. Emily! She barely stirs. Her eyes flutter. Bloody spit spills fr the corner of her mouth. She's alive. Hanging on by a thread. Gelid water also continues to rain down from the sprinkle causing the water level to rise twice as fast as before. The strobe light keeps its cadence, as does the audible a sound.
13) 272) dialog: Please...just hold on. Help’s on the way. Hold on. Emily's almost completely unresponsive. She starts to sli away.
13) 273) dialog: No-no-no...come back, come back. 94. Emily comes around, albeit ever so slightly. But only for moment. She and David look in each other’s eyes...and then... ...she’s gone. Crestfallen, David leans his head against the glass wall, hugging Emily close to him. He shivers madly, colder than ever.
13) 274) dialog: No... The ear-piercing sound of the alarm and the extremely bri strobe light are maddening. Holding Emily in his trembling arms, covered in her blood rapidly comes undone. He looks across the vestibule, at Corey, who, like Harold floats face-down on the surface of the water. Time has expired for him as well. David falls apart. The water from the sprinklers rains do on his defeated head. It’s over. But then --
13) 276) dialog: (reaching his arm back) Burn, you son of a bitch. With that, David throws the bottle down hard from less th ten feet away. -- BOOOOSH!! It crashes directly in front of the Man, instantly engulfing him in flames. A somewhat sadistic, satisfied smile grin crosses David's face. 97.
13) 277) dialog: 
14) 4) dialog: No...what? I don’t...! SCHK-SCHK. The Patrolman cocks the SHOTGUN.
14) 7) dialog: Help me...he’s still here!!
14) 9) dialog: He’s right there!! He’s -- David's cut short by the weight of an Officer’s baton aga the back of his neck. He yells out in pain. Laying prostrate on the ground, David's wrists are handcuffed. The Firefighters move in fast. Attend to the burning Security Guard. With the Officers still pinning him face-first on the gro David lifts his head from the concrete. Looks toward the vestibule. The Man is gone.
14) 10) dialog: No! NO!! After a beat, the Sergeant looks over at the vestibule. H does a double-take after catching a glimpse of Emily’s bo as well as Corey and Harold's. 100.
14) 12) dialog: What are you doing?! No! Wait -- The officers grip tight on David’s arms. Their hands feel like vices against his frozen skin. The Officer SHOVES hi into the backseat of the squad car. SLAM! He’s locked inside. David's head slumps against the window of the police car. His eyes burning red, his breath stolen from the blow fro the baton, all he can do is watch.
14) 14) text: -- A Fire Official turns off the sprinklers and fire alar EMTs lift Emily’s body from the vestibule. -- Police examine the scene, noting the broken security camera and display screen on the ATM. -- Detectives and Crime Scene Analysts photograph and dia the scene, including Corey’s body. -- A Detective opens the trunk to David’s car. Finds Robert's wallet, as well as the deposit envelope filled w cash and Corey’s watch. He also finds Emily’s cell phone, with 911 dialed and ready to be Sent. -- A Detective holds the spool of wire from David’s tool as he examines the wire perimeter. -- A Detective picks up the SCREWDRIVER with a pair of la gloves and places it into an evidence bag. -- Several dead bodies, now covered in white sheets, are wheeled on gurneys into the back of ambulances. -- Detectives review the black and white footage from the security camera located inside the ATM. In it, they see: David and Corey kicking the windows and the plaster wall, looking as though they’re attempting to break into the AT 101. David slamming Corey against the wall and the wrestling m that follows... David attacking and ultimately strangling Harold with the wire attached to the signing shelf pen... David shoving Emily, landing her hard against the floor.. David laying next to Corey, covered in blood. He moves aw and reveals that Corey has a screwdriver sticking from hi stomach. From the camera’s vantage point it appears as though David stabbed him... And David smashing the ATM with the base of the metal was basket until the security camera finally goes to static. But nowhere do they ever see the Man. Not in a single, solitary frame of the security camera video. Because he never came within ten feet of the vestibule, he remained outside the camera’s line of sight.
14) 15) text: It’s as if he was never there. Furthermore, the water flooding the vestibule, Emily’s fa and the subsequent action, all came after David smashed i the camera, leaving no explanation for how it happened. One of the Detectives presses a button on the video playb It instantly brings the security camera footage back to a earlier position -- showing a close-up of David's face as takes money out of his account using the ATM. The close-up image of David’s face remains paused on the video playback screen like a mugshot.
14) 16) text: The Detectives look at each other. One of them holds Davi swallowed ATM card. His name right on it: “DAVID HARGROVE
15) 0) text: An early morning sun peeks over the horizon. Police tape cordons off the crime scene. The area is filled with Police and Fire officials. Emerge lights flash. Walkie-talkies crackle. David remains seated in the back of the police car. The Sergeant taps on the back of the squad car. Signals the Patrolman inside. 102. With that, the Patrolman starts the car. Turns on red and blues. Lets the siren blare. Officers pull back two wooden police barricades, allowing police car's egress. The police car cruises through the parting throng of onlookers and news reporters who have since gathered. INT. POLICE CAR —- CONTINUOUS Physically exhausted and emotionally bankrupt, David’s he falls to his chest. He languidly looks out the car window. Mixed amongst the crowd are several people wearing thick dark parkas, simil to the one the Man wore. David's eyes scan to see if the is among them.
16) 0) text: From within the crowd we watch the police car as it passe by. David turns and looks out the rear window as the police c heads further and further down the street. Until it’s gone.
