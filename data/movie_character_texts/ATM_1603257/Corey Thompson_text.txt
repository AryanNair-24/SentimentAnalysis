10) 31) dialog: No...
10) 33) dialog: And what about the other half of the way? BANG-BANG-BANG!! Even louder this time. Emily, Corey and David watch as the plaster wall rattles slightly.

10) 96) dialog: Fine, I’m unbelievable. David gives up. Stares at the cash and earrings he holds hand, clearly questioning if it is going to be enough. Now what? Emily huddles her arms close to her body for warmth. She trembles. As she stares outside, almost in a state of catatonia, she has a frightening realization.
10) 98) dialog: What do you mean? After a moment, David appears to figure out what Emily’s driving at. He instantly becomes equally concerned.
10) 100) dialog: Who gives a shit?
10) 102) dialog: What? David's panic grows tenfold. His words are pleas for comfort.
10) 106) dialog: Yeah. Okay. It's apparent that Emily is less confident in the plan.

10) 175) dialog: (exasperated) Shit... Corey leans against the glass. Slides down to the floor. Mentally and physically spent. David and Emily are already seated on the floor. They, to have reached their limits. The three of them look at one another from across the vestibule. Shiver uncontrollably. Their faces ashen with grief. No one seems to know what to say.
