Judge  Gaffney walked everywhere for years,  didn't you, Judge? MYRTLE - Didja? JUDGE - I'd better take some notes on  this. You said - one of the doctors came  up to - to talk to you? VETA - Yes - Dr. Sanderson - but don't pay  any attention to anything he says. He's a  liar. Close-set eyes. They're always liars.
