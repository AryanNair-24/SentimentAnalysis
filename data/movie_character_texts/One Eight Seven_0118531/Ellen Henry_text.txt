24) 0) text: On the opposite side of the corridor... we can hear Ellen Henry's voice before reaching her doorway. All brightness and light, full of enthusiasm...
24) 1) dialog: (like, a buzzer; times up) +. EEEEgghh! Wrong. William, you know this. C'mon, how do you find the pound sign? What's the fastest way? (CONTINUED)
24) 4) dialog: (playfully) You're not thinking. (a major clue) How ‘bout Binary search. William remains puzzled. The chain of students delight in chiding him. "C'mon, Beavis!"...
24) 5) dialog: (the answer) You split them! Ellen attempts to bisect the impulsive chain of students with a double-handed karate chop. Fickle chain that they are, they resist.
24) 6) dialog: (amused) ... Very funny. Now a SLOW MOTION fleeting moment as she catches Trevor's passing gaze and openly smiles at him.
36) 5) dialog: .«.. Come by the lab after school, we'll work on it...
36) 12) dialog: Ah! New blood! (extends a hand) Ellen Henry, computer science.
36) 28) dialog: Excuse me... Inexplicably, she gets up and leaves. As Trevor watches Ellen go, Childress slides closer to him.
39) 1) text: as they open --!revealing the clock --!and just as suddenly close. TILT DOWN to find Trevor working the cords to the blinds he's rigged over the timeplace. A FAINT KNOCK breaks his spell as he glances up to discover Ellen Henry standing in the open doorway.
39) 2) dialog: May I come in? (CONTINUED)
39) 8) dialog: Clever... Listen, I wanted to apologize for jumping up like I did at lunch. I was just feeling a little weird...
39) 10) dialog: For what it's worth, Dave Childress thinks you walk on water.
39) 12) dialog: I think it takes a lot of courage to go back into a classroom after something like that.
39) 14) dialog: (smiles) Now you see, there's our predicament. (CONTINUED)
39) 17) dialog: I assume you've met Benny Chacon?
39) 19) dialog: (absently) Last week Benny and his tagging crew had Ms. Eskander pinned in the corner over there. (pointing) .-. She's seven months pregnant and he's tormenting her with a broom handle... Can I help you with those? Trevor is trying to put some books on an upper shelf, but he's having trouble raising his arm high enough. Ellen sees he's in pain.
39) 21) dialog: So anyway, Gloria kicks Benny... and if the district construes it as assault and battery on a student, she's gone.
39) 23) dialog: In a heart beat. She's non- tenured, they don't want to get sued... (with resignation) Don't be surprised if she files for stress leave by the end of the week. Too bad, too. She's a good teacher. WHACK... WHACK... Outside, the kids continue to play. The late sun makes their violent shadows swarm over Ellen
39) 24) dialog: Can I ask you a personal question? (CONTINUED)
39) 28) dialog: (tentatively now) Why'd that kid attack you?
39) 30) dialog: (sobered) Is there any way you can see something like that coming?
39) 32) dialog: Did you know Benny's an O.T.?... In less than a year he's been convicted of felony assault and suspended twice. I even testified against him as a character witness. Now I get to see him every day in homeroom. I'm stuck with him. Condition of his probation is that he stay in school.
39) 34) dialog: Many times... Three weeks ago, Garcia calls Benny's mother in for a conference, but she refuses to show up. She's afraid they'll deport her because she's illegal. So she contacts the A.C.L.U. and some attorney tells her she doesn't have to come in. (still can't believe) Garcia got cold feet and dropped the whole thing. (fear building) This kid's threatening me and all he's worried about is a lawsuit. (CONTINUED)
39) 38) dialog: That he wanted to hurt me. Real bad.
39) 40) dialog: I think so. Someone's been phoning me at night and hanging up... Two weeks ago, my car was broken into... And last Friday, I think he was inside my house... But I can't prove it. The shadows of the basketball players rage inside the bungalow.
39) 41) dialog: (bottom lip quivers) «+. I don't know what to do.
39) 43) dialog: You didn't. OFF Trevor's severe gaze...
44) 2) dialog: (muted) ++. Trevor. Trevor retraces his steps back to the door of Ellen's plant-filled, personalized computer lab. Over the CLACKING of COMPUTER KEYS...
44) 4) dialog: That's great...
44) 6) dialog: Listen, I never thanked you for letting me cry on your shoulder. Trevor flickers a conciliatory nod, now he averts his eyes. (CONTINUED)
44) 10) dialog: (digressing now) Hey, have you seen Benny lately? (as Trevor shrugs) Ford told me he hasn't phoned his P.O. in four days. (weighs guilt; whispering) You know what they say. Be careful what you pray for. Don't get me wrong, Benny's made my life a living hell. I even moved back in with my mother because of him. I love my mother, but if I eat one more dinner off a TV tray or watch one more rerun of ‘Wheel of Fortune,' I think I'll lose my fucking mind. Now an EGG TIMER RINGS O.S. on Ellen's desk. Back into the classroom...
44) 11) dialog: (to class) Time's up. Everyone stop working. Realizing now that all the CLACKING COMPUTER KEYS have stopped moments ago. All eyes are fixed on Ellen and Trevor. «+. Big knowing grins all around.
46) 3) dialog: (breaks the silence) «+. So you have a wife hiding in a closet somewhere?
46) 5) dialog: Don't you ever get lonely? Trevor considers the question.
46) 7) dialog: God that's depressing. They both laugh.
46) 9) dialog: Especially after spending a year in and out of a hospital, I would guess. A beat.
46) 11) dialog: (didn't know about this) What'd they steal? (CONTINUED )
46) 17) dialog: They're still there. Everybody around me seems to have given up. They're all so beaten down. But you're different. You refuse to be beaten.
46) 19) dialog: Remember the last time a student surprised you?
46) 21) dialog: Yeah. Where the kid surpasses all your expectations.
46) 23) dialog: (thinks ) ... That would have to be Daniel Terrazas. This was last year sometime. Kid was failing miserably .-. But he was the best Salsa dancer in the whole school.
46) 25) dialog: So I made 'im a deal. Tutoring in exchange for Salsa lessons.
46) 29) dialog: No, no. He was a perfect gentleman.
46) 31) dialog: Yep, double standard... By the way, did you know Cesar Sanchez was Special Ed? (as Trevor shakes his head) Yep, he never should've been mainstreamed. His I.E.P. says he's L.H. but he acts more like S.E.D.
46) 33) dialog: Come on, Garfield -- on your feet. Lemme teach you how to Salsa.
46) 35) dialog: Let's go. Don't play shy with me, homeboy. Trevor grimaces, awkwardly relinquishes, as Ellen walks him through it.
46) 36) dialog: (still holding wine glass) That's it... Okay, follow me. It starts on the one. Step forward with your left foot... One. Change weight on, two. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
46) 40) dialog: And three, feet
46) 41) text: back together... Now do the same in reverse, starting with your right foot. (talks their way through) One, two, three... One, two three... Trevor concentrates. Up to speed now. Technically he's got it, he just needs to loosen up. Ellen suppresses a gleeful snicker. Now, Trevor attempts to cut loose. He spins Ellen once, into a tango step, one-two-three. Now an awkward dip, causing her glass to spill wine down the back of his shirt...
46) 42) dialog: (horrified, giggling) Oh, my God... your shirt. Oh, no, I'm so sorry.
46) 44) dialog: Can I help?
47) 0) text: as Ellen steps into the doorway and lets out a startled gasp, dropping the box of baking soda. Trevor is bent over, scrubbing his shirt in the sink. His bare back and shoulders are scattered with brutal knife scars. 49 45.
48) 0) text: A tract house in the central San Fernando Valley. Trevor's Rambler is parked at the curb. The house is dark except for a porch light. Trevor and Ellen are greeted by Ellen's golden retriever Jack, who's chained to the front porch. JACK WHIMPERS, ready to bark.
48) 1) dialog: Don't start barking, Jack.
48) 3) dialog: Sorry for reacting the way I did back there.
48) 5) dialog: Didn't scare me. It just surprised me.
48) 6) dialog: --. Thanks for dinner. I had a good time.
48) 8) dialog: Here... you need a little life in that place of yours. Trevor takes it, smiles "thanks"...
48) 14) dialog: (a half-wave) «+. Night.
56) 0) text: As Trevor rounds a corner and runs smack into Ellen on the opposite side of a chain link fence.
56) 3) dialog: (keeping it light) .-+. It's almost been a week. My guess is you're avoiding me. (CONTINUED)
56) 6) dialog: You okay? Trevor nods, sustains an awkward smile.
56) 9) dialog: Is it because I'm white?
56) 11) dialog: We can still be friends. Just don't pull away. Trevor just looks at her. Nods, somewhat bewildered.
56) 12) dialog: (back to lighter note) Now, can I ask you a favor? After you're done with Hyland, can you give me a ride to my car? It's at the mechanics, about five or six blocks up Lankershim. If you can't, it's okay, I can walk.
56) 14) dialog: Que paso, Victor? (CONTINUED)
60) 0) text: Trevor's Rambler, with Ellen in the passenger seat, stops at a large intersection.
61) 1) dialog: ... I have to fly up there for a computer conference.
61) 3) dialog: Day after tomorrow. (CONTINUED)
62) 1) dialog: Oh, you should go sometime, Trevor. I think you'd like it. Really. It's only an hour by air. Maybe five or six by car. Completely different attitude from L.A. Much more like a real city... like Chicago or New York... As Ellen continues talking we see a lowered blue Nissan mini-truck (with matching shell) pull up next to the bus stop. A cholo from the utility shed hangs out the passenger window and taunts Rita. Rita immediately stands and walks back down Magnolia. The mini-truck follows her in reverse. Rita halts and begins ranting at the cholo, waving her arms all around. Now she stomps away and the mini-truck drives away with a lurch.
62) 2) dialog: «+. Only problem is I hate to leave Jack with my mother for any extended period of time. I'm afraid she'll forget to feed him and he'll starve to death.
63) 2) dialog: I can't ask you to do that.
80) 0) text: as an 737 ROARS down onto the tarmac. In the f.g., Trevor and Ellen PEEL away from the curb angrily.
82) 2) dialog: «+. These conferences mainly focus on software now.
82) 4) dialog: (flickers a smile) So, how's Jack?
82) 6) dialog: (flirtatious) And what about Trevor? Was Trevor a good boy, too? Triggers an unintended response...
82) 8) dialog: (innocently) Nothing... (CONTINUED)
82) 12) dialog: (baffled) Trevor... The light changes to green. An impatient young man in the car behind them BEEPS his HORN. Lays it on a little too long. Trevor snaps.
85) 0) text: as the Rambler pulls into the driveway. Ellen's '92 Jeep Cherokee is parked on the street. Bug zapper above the garage flickers on.
86) 4) dialog: +--+ Come out, come out, wherever you are. Where is he? Trevor reaches for a flashlight in the glove compartment.
87) 3) dialog: Here, boy... here, Jack. Come to Mommy, sweetheart. The glare of the flashlight fixes on the trunk of the olive tree. Jack's chain stretching tautly toward the back alley.
87) 4) dialog: (reacting) «+. Oh, my God. Trevor and Ellen, propelled now toward the alley, hearts pounding, frantically rushing toward the conclusion as the flashlight traces the length of the chain...
87) 5) dialog: (cight behind Trevor) Jack?! The chain disappears over the top of the alley wall. Trevor kicks open the alley gate and freezes.
89) 1) dialog: (gut-wrenching) Jack! (CONTINUED)
89) 4) dialog: «+. Jack. HOLD ON her fitful sobs, and...
91) 0) text: Ellen sits on Trevor's bed, fighting back tears. Trevor enters with a glass of water and a pill. Sits down on the edge of the bed.
91) 2) dialog: (vefuses it) .»+. I can't talk to you right now, Trevor. Please. I'm so upset I can't even drive. I just need some time alone. Trevor acquiesces. Steps over to his desk and sets the glass of water down. A key protrudes from one of the desk drawers. He leans over, removes the key and plays with it for a moment. (CONTINUED)
96) 0) text: Ellen awakens with a start. She glances about, momentarily disoriented. Now she remembers where she is and what happened.
96) 1) dialog: Trevor? No response. Choking back emotions.
97) 0) text: TV SET ON. Ellen enters, glances around. No Trevor.
97) 1) dialog: Trevor?
98) 0) text: As Ellen returns. She notices the glass of water on the desk. Bravely collects herself. Crosses over to the desk and sits down.
98) 1) dialog: «+. Where'd you put the aspirin? Like an involuntary reflex she tugs on the center drawer of the desk, but it's locked. Now she pulls on one of the side drawers and it slides open. Ellen stops at what she sees... «+. a treasure-trove of homemade shivs, Bic lighters, Walkmen, pagers... and Benny Chacon's black rosary beads. BACK TO Ellen and her curious, sobered look. Now she slow shuts the drawer.
99) 0) text: Fumbling in her purse for her keys, Ellen makes a hasty departure.
106) 5) dialog: (reticently)
106) 7) dialog: I was going to ask you the same thing.
106) 9) dialog: (an excuse) ++. Can't tonight. Maybe another time. Weighs it, and...
106) 13) dialog: .-. Much better, thank you. A tacit satisfaction that all is well...
109) 1) text: Ellen walks down an aisle of computers as the class settles... (CONTINUED)
109) 4) dialog: .-. Before getting side-tracked with viruses and T-S-R programs, we were talking yesterday about E-Mail. INTERCUT Stevie. Ellen passes Stevie's computer as he shares cryptic information with a kid sitting next to him. Ellen approaches her computer console on wheels at the front of the class.
109) 5) dialog: If you click-on the mail icon in your tray, you'll be ready to send and receive mail. My computer's already set-up. Everyone go ahead and click the white envelope in the lower... Ellen's interrupted by her own computer. A little white envelope icon in the lower left hand tray flashes and BEEPS. Now a COMPUTER VOICE announces: "You've got mail." Ellen's taken aback. Class titters. Now she grins.
109) 6) dialog: Looks like someone's way ahead of me. Alright. (adapts and demonstrates ) To retrieve your mail simply double click the top item in your mail list. (as she does) Since we're all a part of the same network, we share mail... so go ahead and do that. The message read: TEACHER FUCKS NIGGERS Class is dumbstruck. Ellen's riveted. Now she turns. Without losing her temper, she scours the class with a narrow gaze. Class starts to buzz. Now a clicking frenzy to retrieve the same message. The anonymous message pops up on computer screens all around the classroom. Ellen's POV of students (and Stevie). Deciphering reactions. LINGERING ON Stevie's poker face. (CONTINUED)
109) 9) dialog: Whoever sent that message isn't as anonymous as they think. Ellen turns to her console, clicks the REPLY button. A new mail message window opens up. It's addressed to the anonymous sender, STUDENT #00. Ellen types in:
109) 13) dialog: (beat and) You're right, Stevie. I can't afford to live in a big house south of the boulevard. Like you do. Class erupts again, coming down on Stevie and his wanna-b poor boy from the streets image. They're laughing at him now, not with him. In a rage, Stevie kicks open the hallway door and exits the classroom.
110) 0) text: Ellen hastily enters, looking for Stevie. Addresses IRIS (a thirty-something Hispanic woman) behind the counter... (CONTINUED)
110) 3) dialog: Iris, did Steven Littleton come in here?
110) 6) dialog: (reacting) Sue me. Teacher #1 exits in a flurry. Ellen now glances to her right. Seated there in rigid silence is BENNY CHACON'S MOTHER (51).
110) 8) dialog: (to Mrs. Chacon) .+. Espanol, muy poquito, senora. (beat) Mrs. Chacon... you have to slow down. (back to Iris) What's she saying? Hesitating. Now with apprehension...
112) 0) text: Ellen and Mrs. Chacon sit stiffly in front of the ASSISTANT CORONER (mid-forties). Desk cluttered. Half- eaten sandwich in front of him. He nurses a Styrofoam cup of coffee as he flips through a John Doe folder.
112) 2) dialog: .-. Four, almost five weeks.
112) 4) dialog: (indicating John Doe) So he just sits here?
112) 9) dialog: (affirmative) She said he has some pockmarks on his chest; from a bad case of chicken pox. And there's a bar- code tattoo on his neck. A cognitive flicker now as the Assistant Coroner sets down his coffee...
113) 0) text: The acrid fecal smell causes Ellen to flinch. Averting her eyes, she holds onto Mrs. Chacon's arm as they stand next to the autopsy table. A plastic diaphanous sheet covers the body. Now the Assistant Coroner raises the sheet... Mrs. Chacon's traumatic gaze confirms her worst fears. She raises a hand to her mouth. Now the tears come...
113) 2) dialog: (to Assistant Coroner; sotto) Did you find any rosary beads with the body?
115) 4) dialog: You should keep your door locked. ADJUSTING the ANGLE now as the living room comes INTO VIEW... Ellen paces back and forth, consumed by what's troubling her.
115) 6) dialog: (impaling him with a look) I just want you to tell me one thing... Now something she sees stops her pacing... «+. The black rosary beads on the dinner table.
115) 9) dialog: +. If you had any idea what I've been thinking lately... you'd think I was crazy. (cunning it through her mind) ... Remember that John Doe they found in the L.A. River. Turned out it was Benny. (CONTINUED)
115) 13) dialog: .+. Benny's mother identified the body. Trevor just looks at her, a bated pause. Now he blinks.
115) 16) dialog: That's a horrible thing to say. Trevor accepts that it is.
115) 18) dialog: You don't know anything about Cesar's finger, do you, Trevor?
115) 20) dialog: You're scaring me. (CONTINUED)
115) 25) dialog: Trevor...
115) 27) dialog: Trevor, don't.
115) 30) dialog: (confused) What are you talking about?
115) 32) dialog: (momentous deliberation) Where'd you get the rosary beads? (CONTINUED)
115) 37) dialog: (riveted) Yes. Trevor can't find words.
115) 38) dialog: «+. I don't know you. With that, Ellen turns and walks out of the house as quickly as she came.
129) 5) dialog: Why?
131) 6) dialog: (stilted) «+. I'd like to apologize for the other night. Trevor stands there transfixed for a moment. Now he looks into her eyes. A soulful gaze.
131) 8) dialog: We really need to talk.
131) 10) dialog: Tomorrow then? It's important to me.
131) 12) dialog: (resolves it in her head) -+. How ‘bout seven o'clock? Trevor nods. Ellen flickers a tenuous smile. 139
