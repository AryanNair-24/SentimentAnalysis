8) 5) dialog: The purpose of the bicycle is to demonstrate the principle of centripetal force. That's the opposite of the force we studied yesterday, which was...
8) 7) dialog: Centrifugal force... Centripetal force is where the acceleration of a body moving in circular motion is directed toward its center by an opposing force, thus creating momentum that constrains the body to its circular path. Like a gyroscope. (sees nothing but yawns) It's better if I show you. Here, Tywan, you be my helper. Tywan and Auggie are busy talking in the corner. They still haven't passed out the books.

MANEUVERING THROUGH the crowd to DISCOVER DENNIS BROADWAY (16). About ten paces behind. His Snoop-Dogg Afro frames a gold earring and a pair of deep-set eyes filled with vitriol. Oblivious of Dennis, Trevor presses on toward the north stairwell. VARIOUS SHOTS OVERHEAD and THROUGH crowd as the gap between Dennis and Trevor narrows. Every facial expression, every blink of an eye, all magnified a hundred times. Broadway's right hand is wrapped in a dirty white handkerchief as he reaches into the front pocket of his baggie Solos and pulls out a block of wood with a ten-penny nail imbedded in it.
12) 0) text: Trevor's heavy eyelids blink as he slowly glances up into a parabolic mirror on the wall. A silent, paroxysmal terror registers on his face. In a parabolic mirror, the blurred image of Dennis Broadway, pushing hard toward a conclusion now. BACK TO SPEED as Dennis explodes forward, body blocking Trevor from behind, pinning him against a wall and sending the "187" textbook flying. He rams his weapon into Trevor's back. In a SERIES OF RAPID-FIRE CUTS, filtered sunlight shimmers off the sharpened nail as it slashes downward. A barrage of stabbing motions, tearing at cloth and flesh. Trevor's backward flailing arms are ineffective in blocking the frenzied stabfest. Downward slashing, again and again... 10 times. Aftermath. As quickly as it began it's over. Dennis Broadway slams open an exit door and is gone. Students scatter like cockroaches. An eerie stillness lingers. Trevor Garfield is lying on his back now in a pool of blood; black plastic framed glasses in pieces on the floor; lifeless arms spread out at his sides. His rheumy, unblinking eyes stare upward into infinite space. Breathing is the major focus of his concentration now as we SLOWLY MOVE IN ON his face. HOLD and now... 14 15 16 17 11.

His back faces the mob of students that trickle in now as he takes a surreptitious hit off an inhaler. Almost instantly his breathing returns to normal. Now he shuts his eyes and prepares to conjure up the dormant enthusiasm he used to have. Takes a deep cathartic breath. Now he digs a file folder out of his briefcase, opens it, selects a dispatch and approaches the blackboard. BELL RINGS as he picks up a piece of chalk... and begins. First he writes his name in the corner of the blackboard. Now he moves to the center of the blackboard and begins to write per the file folder in his hand...

30) 17) dialog: Okay, Barsek. Read. (The following is read in fits and starts and accompanied by diminishing laughter and ridicule.)
30) 19) dialog: Okay, anyone know what Barsek just said? .-. A unanimous "No." Trevor can see the light at the end of the tunnel now. He's back in the zone.
30) 20) dialog: That's alright. You don't need to understand something to answer a few simple questions about it. Every one of you is capable of decoding data. Watch. Trevor writes question #1 on the board...

30) 29) dialog: +. What did Glis plimp? Before Trevor can finish writing the question, an unidentified voice blurts out, "He plimped a Ho." Scattered laughter. Trevor grimaces, shakes his head. Now attempts to add the question mark at the end of the sentence but the chalk breaks, causing dissension.

He struggles with trepidation as he steps into the doorway of the bungalow and hesitates. A young black girl, LAKESIA STEWART (16), stands near the doorway. She cradles a realistic looking E.N.A.B.L. baby (Education Now And Babies Later).

34) 28) dialog: Okay, who would like to help me pick up the books? Benny, a self-aggrandized exit, crumbles the referral slip and tosses it at Trevor, hitting him square in the back. Like a reflex, Trevor whirls and ducks. Students laugh at his heightened reaction.
