12) 3) dialog: (tone: banal, scientific) We're coming to you now from our base of operations for the Lima Project. And we're going to send you images in a bit from our new Ocular telescope. Sponsored by our good friends at Brookhaven Solar. OVER THIS: ROY’S POV as: men and women prepare for spaceflight, finishing their attire--as Roy LISTENS, an I of CLIFFORD MCBRIDE comes up on his screen. It is like a Skype call gone wrong; the image is high-quality, but the feed is poor, vacillating between a still frame of Cliffo McBride and a sped-up image. The AUDIO is constant. 22.
12) 4) dialog: Now that we believe there are microorganisms on many extrasolar planets, and so many Goldilocks planets perfect for life, we ask the question, “How soon will it be before we find intelligent life in the universe?” ROY’S SCREEN now features IMAGES of SPACE, then NEPTUNE’S MOONS and NEPTUNE’S SURFACES as the AUDIO CONTINUES: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D) We are so excited about this prospect. And who really knows if we haven’t been contacted already? Who knows if our cosmic friends haven't tried to reach us through gravitational waves, or some other method we can’t fathom? We might be cockroaches walking along a chessboard, not knowing about the great game of chess! Now--I...AMa little surprised we don’t have anything yet. [Surprised by] The silence. But--I have confidence. So...thank you, Brookhaven Solar! We have many-- The SCREEN GOES BLACK. “PORTION REDACTED.” A MAN IN WHITE PANTS AND SHIRT then checks with Roy. Roy CLOSES the SCREEN. Referring to his suit:

48) 1) dialog: Hello CBC...Toronto... H. Clifford McBride is on a space station, but exactly wh is unclear. He looks haggard and unkempt. UNHINGED. H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D) I'd like to use this opportunity to reach out directly. To my son. If you could get this to him...please... (beat) Roy... Solitude has increased my perception... I look so far into the universe here, and I see how cruel it is in its indifference... So many planets potentially suitable for life, yet as of now we hear and see nothing... I’ve come to worry that our own long-term survival is in doubt. My death is not something I fear. But--the extinction of ALL ideas, of all human expression--that is the true terror. Our consciousness must extend into the future, past any force that renders us extinct. We must commit ourselves to this goal... (beat) And so I, I... If you see this-- we're, we’re real far away. And some people haven’t been able to keep their composure... (looks down, avoiding) It’s been very difficult... 48. ANGLE ON ROY. His FACE registers that this is his father, addressing him directly--and his father doesn’t look good Roy looks down, at his SLEEVE. His VITALS. Over this: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D) I’m sure you will have a lot of questions about the choices I’ve had to make. But... Perhaps someday you’ll understand. I do miss you. I’m sure you miss me, too. ROY’S PULSE STARTS CLIMBING... So he has to stop watching before the computer redflags his bioactivity...

125) 2) dialog: This will be the final message recorded by the Lima Project. Our efforts have come to an end, and its entire story must be told in the hopes that someday it will be known. ROY MOVES CLOSER TO THE SCREEN. It is his FATHER, virtual seeming to speak from the dead: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D) We came here to pursue mankind’s most noble goal: the search for intelligent life beyond the Earth. But our telescope has repeatedly confirmed only the singular importance--and ephemerality--of our moon, oceans, and magnetic field. After extensive analysis, we now confirm that we are entirely alone in the reachable universe. We shall no longer honor false gods; there is no intelligent life elsewhere, and the rage of the cosmos will destroy us in time. (MORE )
125) 3) text: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D) For this reason, we on the Lima Project had begun to devise a plan for a new system--with galaxies, stars, and planets. We dreamed to be the first lifeform to make the universe anew. CLOSE ANGLE ON ROY MCBRIDE.
126) 1) dialog: With the vast stores of antimatter we have discovered here, our research focused on the creation of a new big bang. Such a project would take perhaps several thousand years to develop. But only such a bold, long-term endeavor would untether us from the earth and ensure the permanent survival of our species.
127) 3) dialog: Our research is contained on the onboard VD recorder. It is the most extensive set of data ever assembled about the visible universe. This must be brought back to Earth so that our scientists can be convinced to act. However, our computer system is currently preventing all outside communication. As it is charged only with the continued pursuit of intelligent life, it has been unable to adapt to our changed prerogatives. All attempts to reprogram it have failed. With no alternatives, we sought to return to the Earth. 99. Roy looks around at the many screens in front of him; the are like SECURITY CAMERAS, constantly cutting from one an to another. ONE ANGLE REVEALS: A SPACECRAFT, with a GANTRY. MODEST SIZE. CLOSE SHOT ON
128) 1) dialog: We hope we will be mourned by a Mother Earth that dared send so many of her sons and daughters into the unknown. In ancient days, human beings looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, our heroes have become creatures of flesh and blood. (MORE )
128) 3) dialog: Others will follow us, and surely find their way home. Our mission must not be denied. HE LOOKS AROUND. He SEES the SPACE. It is MODEST, with SCIENCE BOOKS, and DIARIES, and FAMILY PHOTOS everywhere, pinned on the WALLS. Then we HEAR Francesca’s VOICE, more PRESENT than CLIFFORD McBRIDE’S had been: FRANCESCA’S VOICE “The brain is wider than the sky, for, put them side by side, the other will include, with ease, and you beside...” (beat) It’s so beautiful... Do you want to hear another one...? Then, APPEARING: FRANCESCA! SEATED, SOMEHOW STILL OBEYING GRAVITY as ROY FLOATS! She STARES, saying nothing.
129) 0) text: A lowered gray sky. Deserted. A monastery on the UPPER WE SIDE of NEW YORK’S MANHATTAN ISLAND. A PORTCULLIS. COBBLESTONES. The VIDEO we saw, yes, but now we are “here in the space. A GROUP of children PLAY. ADULTS speak to each other, standing behind the children, watching them play, making small talk. The scene has a strange, dare we say, unearth quality to it. There is a distance to it; not an emotiona distance, but a visual distance. A haze, almost. A dreamlike quality. A SMALLER GROUP of adults, and two children, are here, to They are nearby and yet somehow apart. We SEE: ROY’S MOTHER, LEANNE. Much YOUNGER. She seems PREOCCUPIED, though she smiles a lot as she attends to th children. Also here is some other woman we don’t know, ab Leanne's age. She is completely quiet, almost nervous, as she watches the children play. Then there is H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE, who is involved with t children, making hats for them, drawing for them, joking them. AMONG THE CHILDREN: the young ROY. And the young FRANCESC (though she is older than Roy--she seems around 16 or 17, around 8). She has a grin from ear to ear; Roy does not, instead dedicated to whatever he seems to be DRAWING. H. Clifford McBride stops clowning with another child and moves to Roy’s side. Warmly:
129) 1) dialog: Roy? (beat) Roy? (to Young Francesca) He gets very involved in what he’s doing.
129) 3) dialog: Sweetheart, I need you to listen to me for just a moment--you can go back to your drawing very soon. Roy finally looks up--for just a brief beat. 102. H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D) This is Francesca.
129) 6) dialog: She’s someone...very close to me, someone I really care for. I want you to meet her--I think you'll really like her. Roy keeps drawing--AND THEN TURNS HIS BACK TO HER A BIT. H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D) It’s not so easy for Roy to meet new people. It’s something we’re trying to work on with him. (quieter) We’re hoping he’1ll break through it someday... Clifford approaches Roy. Not unsympathetically, he touche his son and attempts to communicate an important lesson a human interaction: H. CLIFFORD MCBRIDE (CONT’D) (to Roy) When someone talks to you, you say hello, you look them in the eye. You listen, and you ask how they are--you don’t want them to think you don’t care about them. Roy REACTS IMMEDIATELY. He starts to get teary out of embarrassment and awkwardness. Sensing this, she moves to comfort him:
131) 0) text: ROY releases his FATHER’S BODY INTO SPACE, PUSHING IT TOW the SURFACE of NEPTUNE. IN the DISTANCE, WE SEE H. CLIFFORD McBRIDE’S BODY drift TOWARD a RING AROUND NEPTUNE. The BODY comes in contact with a SMALL ICE ROCK. It SHATT INTO A MILLION PIECES. LIKE BROKEN WINDSHIELD GLASS. Almost at the VERY INSTANT that H. CLIFFORD McBRIDE’s BOD destroyed, LIGHTS COME ON in a formerly DARKENED SECTION the LIMA CRAFT.
