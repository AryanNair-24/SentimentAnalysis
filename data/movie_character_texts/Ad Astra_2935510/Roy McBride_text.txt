Now when you see something like that, you just wanna get up there and do it as good as she did. Be part of that team. So we all feed on each other in that way.

It didn’t end up going the way he wanted, but he’s the reason I do what I do. I just think you can’t worry too much about the past because you don’t have control over it. So I look forward. And like I said, we've certainly got ourselves a helluva team here.

But we can HEAR them; we HEAR MERELY the Hank Williams and the SOUND WHIRRING: an AIRPACK, for a spacesuit of some kind. It is Roy’s POINT-OF-VIEW.

It passes below his FEET, and it’s just the mo spectacular vista. The CLOUD FORMATIONS are like Van Gogh “Starry Night,” magnificent swirls, vibrant. Between Roy and the ground is much air activity. About a dozen shuttles (mostly unmanned) crisscross below us, carrying tethers, busses, tether-deployment spools, and o building blocks for modular architecture. Some tethers ar dozens of miles long. SELF-REPLICATING MACHINES, looking like HYDRAS made of GRAPHENE, maneuver up and down the antenna. With the shuttles below him, and SATELLITES high above hi Roy is sandwiched--with a lot of space--in between. The project is visually exciting, but for Roy, it's busi as usual. We HEAR STATIC.

He REBOUNDS against another, parallel (ACTIVE!) tether, I SHOCKED, as he RICOCHETS against it--changing directions- begins to SPIN out of control. He SPINS SO VERY FAST... Is he DEAD...? But remarkably, he’s able to speak--rather calmly, given situation.

WIDER SHOT -- again, EXTREME SLOW MOTION. A SMALL BOY (probably the same person as the one in the previous imag runs across what might be a wet, cobble-stoned street, on cloudy day.

20) 5) dialog: Yes sir. However, the task itself inherently involves risk, especially as it appears you will not have multiple chances. And if it really IS my father who is trying to reengage, obviously I would be anxious to confront him. But I’m also considering the task itself, and not merely my personal views. None of them answers. Roy steps forward: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D) A situation may arise that only I am able to respond to. (beat) So for this reason, I believe I should be part of any continuing mission.

82) 3) dialog: I do believe now it’s possible that my father escaped from Neptune, yes. Ina craft of some sort, perhaps--something of 3-D fabrication. We’d have to find out where he’s hiding here on Mars, course.
82) 5) dialog: Sir, with respect, there’s no one else who had knowledge of the things that have been sent to me. It is him. Lipset looks up. A beat. Then:
82) 9) dialog: I would go with Ms. DeSanctis. She would guide me to the location and I could then initiate the contact with my father. I would set her free and convince him to surrender. You'd have continued access to my data, and you could speak with me directly through my MMU. (beat) This is the necessary mission, sir. And time is critical. Lipset begins to BURN the DATA PAPERS.

83) 1) dialog: Are you uncomfortable with the unit, Ma’am?
83) 3) dialog: This one’s considerably better than the earlier models. I’ve noticed increased flexibility with the newer MMUs. They have all our vitals here. And you can release all the nitrogen fuel at once, if you need to, from the pack or even from your boots, here. (beat; senses her stress) If you breathe normally, there’s no cause for panic.

83) 17) dialog: Yes, it will be completed soon. Our team was really working toward that. All of us, back home. It’s a very worthy endeavor-- communication with other potential lifeforms. DeSanctis looks at her suit. Then: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D) I think you’re ready. A BUTTON on Francesca’s SUIT is PUSHED and it COLLAPSES AROUND HER, SNUG. She looks uncomfortable--but ready. Roy SMILES at her; he’s comfortable. There’s even a level of sexual attraction, maybe. Maybe. Roy talks to his sleeve: ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D) Doctor, Colonel--I think we're good to go here.

Luckily, the atmosphere is so thin that these twisters ar harmless--they just leave a RED/VIOLET HUE over Roy’s and Francesca’s spacesuit and helmet. Francesca finds a HATCH, covered in dust and dirt. POINTS ROY. Roy bends down, shoves the dirt away and find a meta protuberance. After removing more dirt, he is ABLE TO LIF UP THE HATCH.

97) 7) dialog: I don’t know exactly what you’re referring to. As I said, I have some objectives, and our conversation has to be terminated now. FRANCESCA REACHES OVER, HITS a LARGE KEY on a console. A RECTANGULAR MONITOR begins to PLAY IMAGES WE'VE SEEN, of boy and girl at THE CLOISTERS!
97) 11) text: ROY LOOKS AT THE DRAWING. It’s incontrovertible. HE REALIZES. It’s TRUE. FRANCESCA DESANCTIS (CONT’D) He wanted me to reach out to you. I was afraid you couldn’t be trusted at first. But then I lost touch with him and when I saw you, I knew it was the right thing to do. (beat) I called for you, Roy. The messages were from me. HE APPROACHES the SCREEN. NOW IT IS FOOTAGE OF ROY throug the YEARS, beyond the IMAGES we’ve seen. HIM AS A TODDLER AS A TEEN, AS A CADET. FRANCESCA is NOW BEHIND HIM AGAIN.

ROY MCBRIDE (CONT’D) Did you gain any further information from her? Then, without a word, LIPSET REACHES OVER and PRESSES a BUTTON ON the CRAFT’S CONSOLE MONITOR. He types in something, and on comes a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA IMAGE: THE SURVEILLANCE IMAGE is of Francesca DeSanctis, seated, what looks like a small white room with a dropped ceiling fluorescent light. We hear some MURMURING, which is UNINTELLIGIBLE from her, and from the others who surround her. ROY WATCHES, IN TURMOIL. The MEN who surround her are our team: Lipset, Tanner, Scobee, Yoshida. They are at moments on, and offscreen, their backs to us. They appear to be interrogating her. W HEAR SNIPPETS. “What were you doing there...?" “You are sitting there, without any..." She isn’t looking at them. Entering the FRAME is LIPSET:
