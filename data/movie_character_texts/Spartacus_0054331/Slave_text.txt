A nightmare landscapsof dead animals, dead men, dead women, thousands upon thousands of them, extend as far as the eye can see in this dim light -- the field death, silent, lost, breathless. Although historians diff on the number of slave and Roman dead at the Battle of th Silarus River, it seems clear that between fifty and a hu thousand lay on the battlefield. It is a field of death, tending as far as the CAMERAS eye can penetrate. Amidst the awesome litter of war we observe smashed bagga wagons, tattered remnants of tents, shattered arms and sn The arms and iegs of dead horses, males, men, women, chil convulsively up-thrust like columns of cacti against the horizon, impart a grotesque sense of unreality. It seems no breathing thing can possibly exist in this land of dea nor hear amidst this silence.
