58) 0) text: Bobby is behind the counter with Amber. Magic Castle Owne NAREK (50's) is reading reviews on his phone.
58) 1) dialog: ...what does “rachet” even mean? Listen, Amber, you need to tell everybody you know, I need better Yelp reviews. Not just Yelp. Expedia, Priceline, all those. I need five-star reviews. This is killing me.
58) 3) dialog: That’s not a bad idea. I like that. Something catches Bobby’s eye. He looks up. It’s Halley, headed straight for the office. “What shitstorm will this now” is written all over Bobby’s face. Halley enters and marches up to the counter.
58) 6) dialog: Did you see these fake reviews The Wishing Star has? That woman was murdered there last month. No way anyone in their right mind is giving that shithole four stars.
59) 0) text: Narek and Bobby walk and talk, passing RESIDENTS and CURI KIDS. Moonee, Scooty and Jancey watch the adults from the stairs. Scooty is playing with the lighter. Narek points to the bikes locked onto the railings on the second and t floors.
59) 1) dialog: Okay, see? That’s finable now. Make a flyer. Put it under the doors. It should say they have to remove the bikes and lock ‘em in the back. If there are any bikes remaining on the rails we’re going to cut them on August first. Got it?
102) 0) text: Bright daylight. A CHURCH GROUP is handing out bagged loa of white bread to various families. Bobby and Magic Castl Owner Narek stand and watch from a distance. A VICTIM of domestic abuse stands in line.
102) 1) dialog: Do they have to do it right here? Guests come right through here, for Christ's sake, Bobby.
151) 0) text: Bobby, Narek and the DCF Investigator are crammed in the office.
151) 2) dialog: Are you crazy? You want a court case against Magic Castle? That’s the last thing I need. They can review all they want. Plus, this is about the possible neglect of a child.
