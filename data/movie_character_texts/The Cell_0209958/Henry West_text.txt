MIRIAM KENT st before a peculiar diagnostic machine scrutinizing data an images.  Both wear garb favored by surgeons or microchip assemblers.  The impressive, weird computer system HUMS a shifts programs, the unusual brain image changing colors. THROUGH A LARGE WINDOW, we see into an ADJOINING ROOM wit which a HUMAN FIGURE hangs suspended in mid-air by a seri of cables designed to simulate flotation. AT THE CONSOLE, Miriam uses a pen to hit specific areas o the touch-sensitive screen, changing the complex CHEMICAL SYMBOLS displayed there.

Every comfort has been provided and no expense spared. Henry, Miriam, and Catherine, now wearing funky/casual clothes under a lab coat, stand opposite Cooperman.  Sitt on the bed with Edward is ELLA BAINES, an elegantly dress woman in her mid-40's.  There is a soulfulness to her, bu the husband, LUCIEN BAINES, 60's, possesses the icy demea of a corporate tycoon.  One might write him off as cold, we sense a genuine love for his wife and child.

Miriam assume responsibility for Stargher's care and checks his pulse, pupil dilation, and vital signs...
52) 1) dialog: Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
52) 4) dialog: Gentlemen, you stand before the one and only Neurological Cartography and Synaptic Transfer System. Although he's listening, Novak's eyes never really stray his prisoner as Miriam uses safety scissors to cut away Stargher's clothes.
52) 5) dialog: It provides a highly detailed map of the human mind.  Not the brain - any MRI can do that.  The mind. (self-impressed)
52) 8) dialog: But we can't record or store the data.  The connections between nerve cells are constantly being modified. Miriam needs a moment to fully take in the scars.  Henry continues, eager to focus attention back to him, but even is fascinated by Stargher's skin.
52) 9) dialog: It's like the early days of television.  The subject sends out a live feed and you receive it during time of broadcast.  Whatever happens, happens.  All you have to do is "tune in." Miriam gives Stargher an alcohol bath, the clinical proce taking on the quality of ritual.  Her wash cloth moves un Stargher's chin and over his face.
