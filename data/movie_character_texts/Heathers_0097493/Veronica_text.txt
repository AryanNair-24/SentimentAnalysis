VERONICA slides her head down against J.D.'s chest and gracefully rests on his lap. Gently fighting slumber, she murmurs up to J.D., who showers her face with slow kisses

16) 35) dialog: Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
16) 38) dialog: It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano. VERONICA stares off as J.D. paces like a caged animal. He scopes onto the rubble of the shattered coffee table and Cliff Notes for The Bell Jar plus a magazine proclaiming "THE FALL OF THE AMERICAN TEEN" sticking out from beneath HEATHER CHANDLER's body.

16) 48) dialog: She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
16) 50) dialog: You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
16) 52) dialog: That's good. Have you done this before? VERONICA's smile dies as she looks to HEATHER CHANDLER'S
18) 10) dialog: Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness. The class stares to VERONICA as the suicide note is passe her.

26) 16) dialog: Heather, I've got something going with J.D.
27) 22) dialog: All right, but I hope it isn't going to be one of those nights where they get shitfaced and take us to a pasture to tip cows.

KUR intoxicated brain has trouble dealing with the incline. Majestically, J.D. appears at the top of the hill. KURT squints up the hill and falls over backwards.

28) 15) text: I'm sorry. I'm feeling kind of superior tonight. Seven high schools in seven states and the only thing different was my locker combination. We've broke through the peer pressure cooker. So what if we had to kill Miss Popularity.. VERONICA clumsily high heels it up the hill.

I was wondering if you wanted all those things you've been saying to really happen. It's always been a fantasy of mine to have two guys at once...... Sure, you can write Penthouse Forum. Revealed to be lounging on her bed, J.D. laughs out loud. VERONICA throws a book at him.
30) 2) dialog: That's right, tonight. In the woods behind the school. Don't forget Ram.

31) 11) dialog: First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
31) 13) text: Incredible similarity. VERONICA pulls back the note and reads.
31) 14) dialog: Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
31) 16) dialog: We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it was World War Two, not a school play.
31) 19) dialog: Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K. VERONICA swiftly picks up her gun and aims it at the lova tabby entering the room. J.D. rips it away from her.
31) 21) dialog: Oh.
31) 24) dialog: You must have had fun.

35) 6) dialog: I did not want them dead.
35) 8) dialog: Did not.
35) 10) dialog: Did not. J.D. launches into a rapid-fire rendition of "did-to's". VERONICA responds by holding her hands over her ears and singing "We're Off to See the Wizard." J.D.'s "did-to's" get louder causing VERONICA to bang on the horn.

VERONICA hangs up and looks to her battered diary lying against the wall. She crawls to the diary and then reache up to her night table to pull down her monocle and a pen. She sucks a cup of Vodka and begins writing.
38) 2) dialog: Dear Diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count. Sitting up against her bed, VERONICA continues writing as J.F.K. laps up Vodka from the Dixie cup.
38) 3) dialog: The most popular people in the school are dead. Everybody's sad, but it's a good kind of sad. Suicide gave Heather depth, Kurt a soul, Ram a brain. I gave J.D. shit about the Ich Luge thing but what really frightens me is that I'm not frightened by what J.D.'ll do next. It's God versus my boyfriend and God's losing.... VERONICA drops her head back and closes her eyes, popping out her monocle. She swoons down against the bed onto the floor and curls into a fetal slumber.
38) 19) dialog: Can't you see this is a special moment?
