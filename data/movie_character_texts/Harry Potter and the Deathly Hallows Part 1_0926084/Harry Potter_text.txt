127) 20) dialog: All the more reason.
127) 22) dialog: Then why are you here? Why did you come back? Harry's tone is hard, meant to wound. This stops Ron. He steps back, grips the sword with both hands. Harry nods.
127) 23) dialog: I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open. When it does, don’t hesitate. I don’t know what’s in here, but it’1l put up a fight. The bit of Riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me. Ron nods and then Harry sweeps a layer of frost froma flat rock, lays the locket down.
127) 24) dialog: On three. One. Two. Three. (in Parseltongue) Take me inside... Click! The twin doors of the locket SNAP open. Behind each glass window a LIVING EYE blinks -- Tom Riddle’s eyes.
127) 25) dialog: Stab it, Ron. Now. Ron raises his trembling hands, poises the sword. Then a VOICE hisses from the Horcrux.

127) 33) dialog: Ron. Stab it! The locket QUIVERS in Harry’s fingers, turning WHITE-HOT, and he releases it. As the eyes gleam SCARLET, Harry grimaces and a FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT BURSTS forth, leaving in its wake two FIGURES floating in the darkness -- GHOST IMAGES of Harry and Hermione.
127) 36) dialog: Ron. It lies! Stab it! STAB IT!

127) 41) dialog: Do it, Ron! Kill it! Ron’s head turns then, to Harry, and Harry freezes. A trace of SCARLET glints in Ron’s eyes. He raises the sword high and -- for a moment -- Harry looks fearful. Then, Ron pivots and brings the blade down hard, cleaving the locket. A SCREAM echoes throughout the forest and the ghostly Harry and Hermione turn to dust, becoming one with the vapor drifting from Ron’s mouth and all is... Quiet. Harry eyes the shattered locket, then turns his gaze on Ron who stands alone, sword dangling from the end of his arm, chest heaving. Harry scoops up the locket and examines it. Riddle’s eyes are gone, the silk lining stained and faintly smoking. Ron lets the sword fall to the ground, drops to his knees. Harry steps forward and -- carefully -- places a hand upon his shoulder.
127) 42) dialog: After you left, she cried for a week. She’s like my sister.
127) 44) dialog: You've sort of made up for it tonight. Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux.

129) 2) dialog: Fine. Actually... more than fine. He steps aside and Hermione sees Ron, standing at the edge of the camp. She stares, mute, then walks past Harry and the ashes of the campfire, stopping right in front of Ron. He raises a hand, smiles sheepishly.

136) 39) dialog: Who took her, sir? Hermione eyes the printing press. A copy of the Quibbler lies stuck under a roller. She reaches out, pulls it free, the INK STREAKING over the cover, over HARRY’S FACE and the BLAZING HEADLINE: UNDESIRABLE NUMBER #1. (CONTINUED )

Unlike the raging force it was the last time they were here, it is little more than a trickle now. The trees are eerily quiet.
139) 0) text: Harry, Ron and Hermione DASH through the trees. As they diverge, we CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE THREE: Hermione, swift as the wind, flickers through the trees as Scabior pursues her. Harry slashes through the river, looks up, and sees a Snatcher leap across the divide from one tree to another. Ron pounds through thick brush, over a fallen tree. The forest grows more dense, the shadows thicken. Spells splinter through the trees, ropes of light lace the night. Hermione stumbles, regains her footing, finds herself in a clearing. Another figure pelts toward her: Harry. (CONTINUED )
