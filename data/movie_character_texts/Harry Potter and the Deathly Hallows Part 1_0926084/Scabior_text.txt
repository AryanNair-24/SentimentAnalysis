Standing utterly still, Hermione watches as a GANG of SNATCHERS make their way in her direction. They look unwashed and feral, as if they’ve been in the wild for some time.

142) 20) dialog: Worth ten times you if I can find him. Wasn't you that tipped him off, was it? Ron stays mute. Scabior turns to Hermione.
