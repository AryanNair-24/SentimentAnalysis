Miller, cemented into the floor, is slouched over, his sk burned violet, his lips and eyelids crusted, facing the v camera. The air shimmies with the fierce heat. Miller’s lifeless eyes slowly lift.

VARIOUS SHOTS OF MARSH HARD AT WORK, her computer screen flashing with data on Kinross, chat rooms pages, news gro postings. She’s clearly not finding what she’s looking fo At one point, Annie interrupts, pulling Marsh from the de by her hand. At another, Marsh, dead on her feet, watches from her win as Stella and Annie play catch in the front yard. INT. ANNIE’S BEDROOM -- LATER -- DAWN. In bed, Annie lies sound asleep, sprawled amid paste, scissors, construction paper, and a stack of red-white-an blue decorations. Marsh sits down next to her, smiling tenderly at the mess She clears some of it away, then pulls Annie’s blanket up higher. 45. She kisses Annie’s cheek, then slowly lays her head down. Marsh’s eyes flutter shut, the CAMERA DRIFTS TO THE WINDO where the sun rises and birds sing. EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- MORNING. Birds also sing on a charming neighborhood of generous mi class homes set back amid thick foliage. American flags h from many of them. A big, black BMW glides down the block INT. BMW -- SAME -- MORNING. JERRY CARVER, 40’s, handsome, tanned, well-coiffed, drive slowly, looking between a slip of paper in his hand and t passing addresses. Finally, he pulls into the secluded driveway of a middle- class home and parks behind a big, gold Cadillac. EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS HOME -- MOMENTS LATER -- MORNING. Carver, admiring the house, walks up to the front door. H pushes the doorbell. While he waits, he looks around, admiring the garden, the oak tree, the fence. Right next to Carver, at a side window, a curtain parts a YOUNG MAN looks out. Carver doesn’t notice. MEET OWEN, 30, his skin unwholesome, his eyes devoid of light. He studies Carver for a few long beats, then he disappears. Moments later, just as Carver is about to press the bell again, Owen opens the door. His smile is bright, but stif as though his face might crack. Carver tries to hide his surprise at the young man’s disturbing appearance.

Griffin tosses in a match and the coals burst into flame. 49. INT. OWEN’S BASEMENT -- DAY. Naked but for boxers and black socks, Jerry Carver lies unconscious, bruised, gagged, slumped against the folded- picnic table. His torso is snaked with patriotic bunting. An I1.V. tube buried in his clavicle and taped in place. A few feet away, we see the rotting shape, embedded in th cement floor, of where Herbert Miller was cut in two. Suddenly, one of Jerry Carver’s lifeless arms jerks to li like a marionette’s. Then the other one does. They both snap up and bang back against the Ping-Pong table. We realize that his arms are being controlled by Ethernet cables tied to both wrists, and connected to a crank. As cable is stretched tighter, Carver’s body rises and his a spread wider and wider. Coming to, Carver begins to moan, turning his head from s to side. Owen walks out from behind the table. He kneels opens a tool box and removes a metal tool meant to scrape paint from window panes. From a tiny cardboard sheath, Owen slips out a double-edg razor blade and slips it into the tool. EXT. MARSH’S BACKYARD -- LATE AFTERNOON. A PACK OF CHILDREN swarm and scatter, laughing and scream with delight, spraying each other with SQUIRT GUNS. At a PICNIC TABLE, PARENTS chat, eating hotdogs and burge sipping beers. Marsh, holding a beer, stands alone, watch as the sun bleeds below the tree line. She turns and sees Annie happily squealing, backed agains flower bed, drenched by her friends. Marsh looks over and sees Griffin manning the grill. Griffin glances at Marsh and their eyes click like billia balls. They share a smile. It’s interrupted by--

A TEENAGE BOY, smoking a joint, lies on his hammock, with OPEN LAPTOP COMPUTER on his lap. On the other side of a nearby fence, a barbecue is in progress. The teen laughs, sputtering, watching a home video clip o kid getting hit in the bare chest by a Roman candle. The moment when the firework knocks the kid off his feet play over and over again in slow motion. Ping! The teenager gets an Instant message: <<Dude, KWM - back up!>> Excited, the teenager takes a hit off his join and clicks on the little red heart of his Favorite Places Killwithme.com loads. When he sees Jerry Carver strapped to the table, he laugh hard that he chokes on his smoke, but then he abruptly notices something unbelievable. He puts his nose right up the screen to be sure. No way! He flies out of the hammoc almost dropping his laptop, and rushes over to the fence-

4) 44) dialog: And this. He holds up two disks. GRIFFIN (cont'd) One for you and one for me. Every video clip he ever uploaded. That was his real hobby.

4) 45) text: GRIFFIN(cont 'd) Sort of a personal greatest hits. He called it the “My Best of the Worst.” Griffin clicks. Marsh settles on the corner of his desk. Menacing rock accompanies a fast, grisly, one-minute mont of car accidents, police shootings, street fights convenience store murder, athlete’s broken limbs, traffic helicopter footage of a suicidal man lifting a rifle to h mouth.... Before the man pulls the trigger, Marsh grabs Griffin’s m and stops the movie.

5) 42) dialog: You sure?
5) 44) dialog: So you wanna hear my theory about why he tried to scare the crap out of you?
5) 46) dialog: Because there is a connection between him and Kinross, and somehow he knows you’re onto it, and he wants to drive you off the case.
5) 48) dialog: Maybe. I mean, it’s a long shot and I still need to check out some details, but-- (click) Shit! Hold on. (clicking over) Hello?

FIRE ANTS come crawling out, joining the exodus leading t Griffin. He screams louder, bucking and writhing. After a few long seconds, the door lowers, cutting off the ants. OWEN (cont’d) I like you, Griffin. Jennifer, too. You’re both really intelligent. Especially Jennifer...no offense. So it’s not personal. I’m only doing to you what your friends will do to me when they catch me. Only they’1l use Potassium Chloride, and they won’t let very many people watch. Even though almost everybody will want to. (beat) Oh, wow. As the Viewer counter flies past 4,500,000, the door star to lift. Griffin screams into his gag. Owen shakes his head. OWEN (cont’d) So much faster this time. Word of mouth, I guess. (beat) Or maybe it’s because you’re wearing your badge. INT. TASK FORCE COMMAND CENTER -- LATER -- DAY. The Task Force sits and stands, paralyzed before the monitors. The counters spin so quickly that action is impossible. Among the group, Marsh sits, watching in agony, helpless, Griffin screams and writhes, his limbs and torso thick wi ants. She can’t take it an instant longer. She jumps up a races out of the room. INT. CYBER DIVISION HALLWAY -- LATER -- DAY. Marsh runs down the hall, as though being pursued. 86. INT.

That’s what Griffin and I asked ourselves and, the night before he died Griffin found the answer. But the killer knew that he had, and he got to him first.

Click again, and now the VIDEO CLIP plays, muted. The clip shows Cleary in distress, looking up at the circ choppers, then over at three police cars that have stoppe the highway thirty feet away. Officers are crouched at their car doors, weapons drawn. Cleary looks over the edge of the overpass and considers jumping. 97. One of the Officers, wearing a bulletproof vest, walks sl toward him, weapon lowered, trying to talk sense to him. Cleary throws a leg over the railing and screams at him t stop. The Officer does not stop. He merely slows down, still talking and advancing, urging him to lower his rifle. As he gets closer, our chopper swerves dangerously low, Cleary panics. Ina flash, he puts the rifle in his mouth and pulls the trigger. The back of his head blows off. Click. The frame freezes. MARSH (cont’d) The back of Cleary’s skull landed on that roof. A Burger King. So did his glasses. The piece of skull was turned over to the coroner. But the glasses were retrieved by the assistant manager. Click. The Burger King employee I.D. of Scott Hickman. MARSH (cont’d) He put them up for sale on ebay. There were plenty of bidders, but when word got out, the auction was shut down.
