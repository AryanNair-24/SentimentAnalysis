3) 149) dialog: Just listen to me. What would happen to the business if, God forbid, something happened to you? Mom would probably have to sell to strangers. I'm willing to start at the bottom, you can treat me as a regular employee, I want to learn everything there is to know about running the box business, and then when the time comes, the business would stay in the family.
3) 151) dialog: What?!
3) 153) dialog: What would you do without...?! There's a knock on the door.
3) 165) dialog: I'll talk to Mom, but I'm not going back to school.

4) 14) dialog: Yes, he's a married man and he doesn't want to have anything to do with me.

7) 140) dialog: I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it, Daddy. It was horrible but I really didn't know the guy that well. It happened at about the same time I found out I was pregnant, and it just went out of my mind.
13) 4) text: I don't think so. It's the whole thing, Marshall. If I could find a way to just disappear, where there was absolutely no trace of me; because eventually I will get caught doing this.
