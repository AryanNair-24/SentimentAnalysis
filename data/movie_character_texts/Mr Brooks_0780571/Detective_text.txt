On the seat next to her is a copy of the Chicago Tribune. headline of a middle article on the first page reads: THE HANGMAN ESCAPES. Move up to Atwood's face. The Older Detective followed by Younger Detective approaches.

Almost like Mr. Brooks, Atwood's nostrils flare, but in Atwood's case it's not the scent of death that arouses he but it's like she's searching for the scent of her prey. In a glance she memorizes the Room, then steps inside.
3) 68) dialog: (indicating the Victims) He always rearranges the bodies, but this is out of character. He has never left them in such a crude position. Usually it's more romantic with their arms around each other, kissing, their mouths open, their tongues touching.

4) 87) dialog: And when did you bag the gun? Because even though I'm sure you're an expert at it, there's still a chance of noise from the plastic. She continues down the HALL to the BEDROOM.
4) 88) dialog: Was the door open or did you have to open it? She opens the door and goes in.

If the dance Couple were on the bed and their blood was n on the wall, the room would look exactly the way it did w Mr. Brooks said 'hello'.
4) 94) text: That's better... What thrill do you get by killing people? Is it sexual, is it hate, is it power? Do you feel remorse? Probably that part of your brain doesn't exist.
