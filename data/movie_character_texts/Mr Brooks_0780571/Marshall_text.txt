0) 2) dialog: Why do you fight it so hard, Earl?
0) 4) dialog: Come on, you've been a good boy for a long time, you deserve a little fun. Our view moves back up to the Woman's breasts.
2) 13) dialog: Come on, Earl, give yourself a break, you know you want to do this.
2) 15) dialog: You're the fucking 'man of the year', you deserve it. It's not like it's not set up. You already know how to by-pass the alarm, you know how to pick the locks. Tonight's the perfect night.
2) 17) dialog: I heard you, Earl, but you don't mean 'no'. Emma feels Mr. Brooks's distance.
2) 26) dialog: (from the back seat) They have their dance class tonight. What if we go by and just look at them. There's no harm in just having a look.
2) 28) dialog: Please... pretty please.
2) 36) dialog: I bet your dick's getting hard, isn't it, just imagining what they would look like dead? Savoring the ice-cream, Mr. Brooks nods. EXT. BROOKS HOUSE Г‘ NIGHT Two story modern. Not ostentatious, but the elegance of t line and the grounds say there's big money here.
3) 10) dialog: Oh Lordy, Earl my boy, I've missed this! We are going to have so much fun!
3) 15) dialog: Don't you dare quit on me, you piece of shit. I want to see what they're doing. Mr. Brooks's spine stiffens and he's going forward again. Entering a HALLWAY, he reaches into his jacket. When his reappears it's inside a Ziplock bag, his fingers around t butt of a silenced pistol. He brings the hand and bag to his mouth and tightens the Ziplock against his wrist. The two Men arrive at a door that's slightly ajar. Behind the sounds of the love-making are becoming more intense. Mr. Brooks nudges the door with his foot. It opens enough he and Marshall to see the Couple inside. The Man and Woman from the Arthur Murray dance class are naked on the bed. As much as Mr. Brooks hates himself for it he loves watch He can now hear his heart beating in his ears. He begins to breathe in unison with the Couple, but his expression is distant almost clinical. When the Couple climaxes, when they come, Mr. Brooks's fa goes blank. On the bed the Woman rolls off her Partner and the two of them lie there basking in the afterglow. Behind them Mr. Brooks pushes the door fully open and sli into the ROOM. They don't know he's there until he speaks
3) 23) dialog: (barks) Whoa, Earl, what the fuck is this?!! Mr. Brooks snaps a look. The curtains of the bedroom window are open; and over hal the Apartments in a four story Building on the other side an alley can see into this room. Most of their windows are dark. And there's no one lookin out of the windows that are lit.
3) 24) dialog: These pigs liked to fuck with the blinds open, you should have known that, Earl. This is a big mistake for you, Earl.
3) 26) dialog: Well, don't fucking do that. I don't think either of us would enjoy spending the rest of our lives in jail or a lethal injection.
3) 33) dialog: Don't even think about it. You know the rules. Reluctantly Mr. Brooks throws the Polaroids into the fire the kiln.
3) 34) dialog: Now go up and make love to your beautiful wife. He leaves. In the kiln, the Polaroids burst into flame. EXT. MURDER HOUSE Г‘ AFTERNOON The sunlight exposes its charm. If it weren't for the Police tape, the UNIFORMED OFFICERS and the PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES, it looks like it would b cool place to live.
3) 117) dialog: You're such a fucking hypocrite. If you were honest you would step out there and say 'Hi, I'm Earl. I killed two people last night and I really got off on it, but I need your help to be cured.'
3) 119) dialog: Yeah but for the next 29 days you're going to have to step out there and say 'Hi, I'm Earl, I'm an addict.' And everybody will know you fell off the wagon. Don't you feel stupid doing that?
3) 144) dialog: She's not telling you everything, she's hiding something.
3) 185) dialog: Stop your fucking whining, Earl, you enjoyed doing that Couple just as much as I did, and look on the bright side, he came to us he didn't go to the Cops. If he tries to shake us down we kill him. Period. We make it fun but we kill him. End of story. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BROOKS BOX FACTORY Г‘ DAY The Man from the Reception Area is nervously admiring a display of Mr. Brooks's ceramic pieces. He turns at the s of the door opening behind.
3) 199) dialog: And you were worried that this was going to be unpleasant. The answer is simple. Just tell him you've decided never to kill again and he'll go away.
3) 204) dialog: In a word, yes.
3) 206) dialog: He put them in a safety deposit box but I'll bet the box is at the bank where he has his checking account and the key is on his keychain. He really wants to do this, he's not going to go to the cops. Mr. Smith who has grown uneasy under Mr. Brooks's stare swallows:
3) 223) dialog: I can't think of anything else. Mr. Brooks stands up and opens the door.

Standing in front of this is CAPTAIN LISTER, a tall slim faced Woman in her mid-fifties, and the lead Crime Scene Technician we saw earlier at the Murder House.
4) 116) text: (taking the card) I wish I could be of more help, but sorry. Watching him walk away amid the crinkle of his raincoat, Detective Atwood, maybe because of her woman's intuition maybe because she's a good cop, wonders what is in that manila envelope under his arm. The thought is gone almost as soon as it comes and she fa about to the next door. EXT. STREET Г‘ NIGHT Hunched against the rain, Mr. Smith is acutely aware of t traffic. His eyes strain to see the Occupants of each pas car. He doesn't give a second thought to the older non- descript Toyota parked against the far curb. INT.

4) 138) dialog: Wow! We've never known anyone who's looking for us before. Mr. Brooks pinches the rectangle of paper away from Mr. S for a closer view.
4) 139) dialog: We've got to find out everything there is to know about this woman.
4) 169) dialog: (leans forward) Maybe Mr. Smith would like to kill the driver of the pickup.
5) 57) dialog: I think that was right. Go back.
5) 59) dialog: With the taxes we pay, you'd think they could make it more difficult to hack into the Police personnel files. We tip toe under the door. INT.

5) 68) dialog: Oooh... She's caught a lot of people... And look here, this isn't the first time she's been hunting for us.
5) 74) text: Jesse Vialo... Good looking, a little younger than she is. MARSHALL
5) 76) text: The old man being rich doesn't mean she's rich. Maybe he's one of those guys who would rather give it to the Opera than to his kids. MARSHALL
5) 79) text: The Opera didn't get much. MARSHALL
5) 86) text: No, I like her because she found something that's hers. It's not the family business. And she's good at it. I'd like Jane to find something that's hers and that she could be good at. MARSHALL

7) 159) dialog: You've always cleaned up after her, whatever she did, all her life.
7) 161) dialog: Do you think she knows what kind of trouble she's in?
7) 163) dialog: And where would you be but at the exact same place you are now. It is not your fault, Earl. Part of your problem with her is that you always think it is.
7) 165) dialog: What are you going to do?
7) 167) dialog: And what about her child?
7) 171) text: Emma and I would raise it. MARSHALL
7) 196) dialog: (from the couch) Before you open your mouth, be very sure this is the right thing to do.
7) 198) dialog: You get pissed at me because I'm always the one arguing to go ahead and do murder. Not this time, Earl. This is your decision.
7) 200) dialog: Then don't do it. Go with Mr. Smith tonight and end that, then let the Police put Jane in jail. Hopefully that will save her and we can happily go on with our tortured lives.

13) 2) text: Dirty. MARSHALL
13) 4) text: I don't think so. It's the whole thing, Marshall. If I could find a way to just disappear, where there was absolutely no trace of me; because eventually I will get caught doing this. And it'll be very embarrassing for me and Emma and Jane. So I've been thinking... is there a way that Mr. Smith could kill me and make me disappear. MARSHALL

17) 13) dialog: Ah... now I get it. You were counting on that, weren't you?
17) 15) dialog: But if your plan is to have him kill you, why do you have to kill someone else first?
17) 20) dialog: Not even you believe that, Earl. It makes it more exciting, doesn't it, to think he's going to kill you after you kill someone else. You're getting your rocks off big time, that's why you're doing it.
17) 117) text: You're welcome. In the back seat: MARSHALL
17) 189) text: Anyone who is good at what they do, wants recognition. But since I'm not going to do it anymore, I'll let Mr. Smith take the credit. MARSHALL
