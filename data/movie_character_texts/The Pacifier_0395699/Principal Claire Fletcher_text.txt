57) 24) text: Murney grimaces as PRINCIPAL CLAIRE NELSON (early 30's) enters. She's attractive, assured, tough. He withers.
57) 26) dialog: Good morning kids. What are you doing in my office, Murney?
57) 35) dialog: Very little. I thought I asked you to find out who stuck to the baloney slices to the cafeteria ceiling with mustard?
57) 39) dialog: Then hop to it. I think I can handle this from here.
57) 44) text: Principal Claire eyeballs him... staring him up and down, as he casually holds the three kids.
57) 46) dialog: So. You're the new baby-sitter?
57) 50) dialog: It's okay, Lieutenant, I was briefed of the situation by Mrs. Plummer. She told me all about you.
57) 53) dialog: Lieutenant, huh? You with "The Teams?" (Shane nods.) Petty Officer Third Class Claire Nelson at your service.
57) 57) dialog: Four years at Naval base Coronado.   The Service paid for my college.
57) 68) dialog: Commitment". That's the way I live my life, and the way I run my school.
57) 73) dialog: Permission granted. Welcome aboard. Just try not to frighten the children.
59) 8) text: Tyler gurgles, ignoring him. Shane sighs. Principal Claire sits next to Shane with her lunch tray.
59) 10) dialog: What would you say is the secret with kids, Mr. Wolfe?
59) 18) dialog: So. When you agreed to serve your country, I bet you didn't know you'd be serving creamed bananas to one year olds, huh?
59) 19) text: Shane gives her a look. Principal Claire smiles.
59) 28) dialog: Not here, you don't. You're on dry land, lieutenant. (she looks at his chair) Well, not so dry where you're sitting, I guess.
59) 34) dialog: Don't take this personally -- but you're pretty good at this. Seriously, I'm impressed. A whole day, and all three Plummer's stayed out of trouble. That's... unusual.
59) 53) dialog: Todd started a fight with five students at once?
59) 58) dialog: If I catch anyone on the team fighting again, next week's tournament is off. I don't care who starts it.
59) 86) dialog: ... Don't even think it, Murney. He'd kill you so fast, I wouldn't even have time to get my camera.
60) 3) dialog: Another day, another dollar twenty, minus taxes... aren't you gonna change him?
60) 7) dialog: That's not what I mean, Lt.
60) 13) dialog: Sirnosir. Not my job.
60) 17) dialog: Instructions are right on the box. Bathroom's down the hall. Have fun.
69) 1) text: Principal Claire sits with the Kids in the living room. From outside, they hear the front door open, and the sound of OMINOUS, SQUISHY footsteps.
106) 1) text: Shane enters. Zoe sits in a folding chair, mortified. She is holding a broken-off SIDE VIEW MIRROR. Murney stands, Principal Claire next to him. They look concerned.
106) 10) dialog: Ordinarily I would wait for his mother to return... but -- I'm a bit concerned, and I'm not sure what to do...
106) 14) dialog: Well -- yes. He does always miss sixth period. But this...
106) 31) dialog: It's certainly not normal. (pulls Shane aside.) See if you can talk to the boy.   Find out what's going on.
118) 6) dialog: (a long, severe stare) Now... WALK! DOUBLE TIME.
118) 28) dialog: (she coyly smiles) I've noticed improvement in your troops lately, too. Noon and none of them have been called to my office. It's a miracle.
118) 38) dialog: This old thing? Well, you never know who you're going to run into.
118) 39) text: She smiles. He smiles back... Suddenly, there's a commotion: Murney is marching Todd towards them, dragging him by the ear. Principal Claire sighs "not again." In one move, Shane leaps over the table. Principal Claire watches him leap:
118) 41) dialog: ... Love it when he does that.
118) 70) text: Silence. No one's sure they heard him right. Todd pulls out a stack of SOUND OF MUSIC FLYERS and hands them out. Todd is on the poster in his Rolf costume. Principal Claire takes one: she laughs, now it all makes sense.
175) 31) dialog: Ya!!
178) 3) dialog: So. What happens now? You'll be stationed somewhere else, right? I guess there's no more reason for you to stick around here.
178) 13) dialog: Well. Summer's almost here. What if you and me did a little amphibious recon mission. On, say -- Maui?
