26) 2) text: Shane's P.O.V.: Julie's unkempt suburban house, with toys all over the lawn, and a "BLESS THIS MESS" welcome mat.
26) 10) text: The door opens revealing JULIE PLUMMER. Julie holds NAKED baby PETER, 2. She sees Shane, and stops, a little startled by his size...

26) 17) dialog: Come in and meet the rest of the gang.
27) 1) text: It's warm and quiet.   Petite Julie SCREAMS up the stairs
27) 10) dialog: KIIIDDS!!!
27) 13) dialog: Get your butts down here and say "hello!"
27) 16) dialog: You've already met Lulu. This is Peter, Zoe and Todd. Kids, this is Lieutenant Wolfe. He's the man who is going to be staying with us for a while.
27) 22) dialog: And this is Helga and Tyler.
27) 27) dialog: Kids, go finish your homework.   And I'll be checking.
27) 28) text: Zoe, Lulu and Todd climb back up the stairs. Julie leads Shane into...
28) 1) text: Julie sits, Shane stands "at ease" (which doesn't look "at ease" at all).
28) 11) dialog: Charles wasn't around too much. His work took him all over the world. He'd be gone six or seven months at a time. So I think for the younger ones it's a little confusing. Zoe and Todd... well, they're dealing like your normal teenagers. Maybe in Todd's case semi-normal.
28) 15) dialog: Charles was in a dangerous business. I knew it when I married him. No one's to blame here. (beat) Everyone thinks that Charles told me or the kids where he hid it. And until G.H.O.S.T. is found, we're all in danger.
28) 20) dialog: That's Gary. He was Charles'.
28) 25) dialog: Call me Julie.
28) 30) dialog: I'm glad you're here-

29) 3) dialog: I'll be there.
29) 10) text: Julie and Shane share a look.
30) 1) text: Julie, with her suitcase, Shane, Helga and the Kids stand in the doorway. Zoe listens to her I-Pod ignoring the hug Julie gives her.
30) 3) dialog: Don't worry about the Kids, Helga will handle everything. (Worried:) But if there is an emergency, all the emergency numbers are on the fridge. And on the phone. And on the back door...
30) 7) dialog: (a little choked up:) I know, it's just... I am a mom, it's my job to worry. ... I love you guys. I'm gonna miss you. I'll be back in 48 hours. And guys, whatever Lieutenant Wolfe asks you to do... do it. Okay?
30) 10) dialog: Lieutenant, I don't want you to worry about anything except the safety of my children. Helga will take care of everything else.
30) 15) text: Julie gets in the car and it drives away. Shane turns back to the kids who loom in the doorway.
47) 1) text: Bill and Julie, looking jet-lagged, sit across a desk from a SWISS BANKER. He seems to be about 100 years old. He's reading a HUGE stack of paperwork with a magnifying glass, mouthing along in FRENCH. It's taking him a LONG time. They wait patiently -- til their patience runs out.

47) 27) dialog: Thank you. How long is that?
54) 1) text: The garage door opens, dramatically unveiling Shane. He's wearing Tyler in a SNUGGLE. Across his chest, he's got a bandoleer of baby-bottles and juice boxes. Shane can't hide his contempt as he sees: Julie's WHITE MINIVAN. A bumper sticker declares "World's Greatest Mom." Shane puts Tyler in a CAR SEAT. Its interlocking buckle connects FOUR WAYS. Shane fumbles with it for a while. It just doesn't add up...
86) 2) dialog: I'm a mom, it's my job to worry.
86) 6) dialog: It's only a few more days. I hate leaving you, but you know I have to do this. I love you.
101) 2) dialog: Oh my god!
101) 13) dialog: Well, yes and no. We found something in the box... But we're not sure what it is. Bill thinks it's part of the GHOST. It looks like some kind of "key". We just don't know what its for.
101) 16) dialog: The good news is I'll be home in two days, as soon as the customs paperwork clears.
138) 3) dialog: The red tape is cleared up, we're on the first plane in the morning.
144) 1) text: We pan up from the WHITE "US GOV" license plates to Bill at the wheel. Julie sits beside him. Bill's cell phone rings, he answers it.

152) 1) text: Julie and the Kids are on the floor, tied up. Peter and Tyler are caged in the play pen. Peter has a JUICE BOX. The Korean Man (Mr. Chun) secures the room, closing the window shades. Bill checks the knots binding the children. They whimper, scared.
152) 6) text: He GAGS the kids.    Julie glares, livid.
152) 8) dialog: I trusted you. Charles trusted you. So did the Department of Defense.
152) 11) text: Bill GAGS Julie. The Kids are furious. Bill and Mrs. Chun exit.
155) 35) text: All the kids bounce up. They untie Julie, then scoop up Peter and Tyler. Mr. Chun growls and starts to stagger up. Lulu lands in Karate stance and calls out:
160) 1) text: The family comes scrambling out -- but as Julie exits, a HAND suddenly GRABS her.
160) 3) dialog: AGGGH!
160) 6) dialog: Keep going!     RUN! Go GET HELP!!!
161) 1) text: Bill pulls Julie inside. Mrs. Chun listens to Mr. Chun ON THE RADIO, speaking in Korean:
165) 1) text: Bill has Julie at gunpoint, leading her to the secret door. They step past Shane's body, lying on the concrete.
165) 5) dialog: How does what work?
165) 9) dialog: I don't know any code -- Charles didn't tell me about the room...
165) 12) text: Julie GASPS, chilled. Then, a CRACKLING of static.    Mrs Chun exits the vault, holding a military RADIO.
165) 30) dialog: NO!
165) 31) text: Julie goes frantic, emotional.
168) 1) text: Shane scopes out the vault. The walls and ceilings are covered with high-tech weaponry. Mrs. Chun holds Julie. Bill waits impatiently. Shane is figuring his options...
168) 4) text: A bewildered beat -- then Julie pulls out a tube of Binaca. Shane SQUIRTS it, revealing in the mist a myriad of crisscrossing LASER BEAMS.
168) 39) dialog: (to Bill) You can't make him do this -- He doesn't have a chance.
168) 57) text: Shane LAUGHS sharply. That's the code! He shares a look with Julie. Bill and Julie share a look -- they have no idea what he's laughing about.
168) 65) text: He steps sideway, across two tiles. Again -- NOTHING HAPPENS. It dawns on Julie what he's doing. Julie smiles, relieved. Shane he steps forwards, then back:
168) 68) text: When he steps back -- A SPRING-LOADED SPIKE launches down from the ceiling, imbedding itself where he was standing. Shane is rattled, his focus gone. Until Julie shouts:
168) 70) dialog: QUICK LIKE A TURTLE LIE ON YOUR BACK!
172) 18) text: Bill signals for Mrs. Chun to go first. She gestures back: you go. It's a stand-off. Finally, Bill takes a breath -- and walks across the room. The Booby Traps are disarmed. Mrs. Chun follows, pulling Julie along.
172) 69) dialog: Shane!   Watch out!
172) 77) text: Julie gasps. Shane narrows his eyes, then whispers/sings.

178) 45) dialog: What's Friday night?
179) 13) text: In the audience, Julie watches in astonishment. She is surrounded by her children. Scott: in a suit, his hair combed, Claire: dressed to the nines, the little Brownie Troop, even Murney. Lulu has a basket in her lap -- inside: GARY THE DUCK and his new family, the most adorable ducklings you ever saw.
