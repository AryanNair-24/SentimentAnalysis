59) 65) text: The Bell rings, the crowd breaks up. Murney approaches Shane.
59) 68) text: Murney makes a loud Kung Fu CRY and throws a punch, stopping an inch from Shane's head. Shane doesn't flinch.

59) 82) text: Shane puts an arm over Todd's shoulder. Todd shakes him off and heads to class. Murney snickers to Claire:

60) 5) dialog: I'd love to, for one who'll eat, and not cry.
60) 8) text: Then Shane smells what she means -- Tyler's diaper is full. Shane recoils in disgust, holding Tyler out like a grenade.
60) 10) dialog: Oh -- change him. Roger that. Uh...
60) 15) dialog: But...
60) 22) text: Just then, an alarm in his Jacket GOES OFF. He looks at his tracker: it's flashing RED 3 RED 3. Shane hands off Peter and Tyler to the Principal.
60) 24) dialog: Emergency!
61) 1) text: Shane runs down the hall, following his tracking device. It leads him to a door. He bursts though it, doing a shoulder roll.
62) 1) text: 2ND GRADERS are sitting on the floor. Lulu is in front of the class, with the Panic Button in her hand. The board reads: SHOW AND TELL. Shane lands in fight stance -- the Class applauds. Next to Lulu is a very upstaged LITTLE BOY with a FROG. Lulu sticks her tongue out at him.

65) 1) text: The BLINKING DOTS on his tracker are side by side, racing down the road ahead of Shane. They make a sharp right. Shane makes a right, almost tipping the minivan. He blasts through a red light.
67) 1) text: Two BIG CONSTRUCTION workers are standing on the other side of the plywood wall -- Shane KICKS out one entire section, and charges through.
67) 6) dialog: Tell me where the kids are and I'll let you all live!

67) 15) text: No sweat. Shane lowers himself down.
68) 1) text: Shane lands shoulder deep in DISGUSTING SLUDGE. He winces, then checks the tracker -- the DOTS are CLOSE, feet away. Shane trudges through the river of muck.
68) 3) dialog: Red 1?   Red 2?
69) 2) text: Then the door swings open, revealing Shane, looking like a Swamp Creature. Everyone gasps, then covers their noses. A CUTE YOUNG COP enters behind Shane. Todd stiffens. Zoe fixes her hair. The Cop looks at them.
69) 5) text: The Cop turns to Shane, with a smirk.
69) 12) dialog: (eerily calm:) Just fine, thank you.

71) 1) text: Shane BURNS his clothes in the barbecue.

73) 2) dialog: Who are those people?

75) 4) text: Shane blows passed her, revving a cordless POWER DRILL.

76) 1) text: Shane's finishing up the last window.
76) 4) text: Shane lifts her window so it's open a HALF INCH, then drills it into place. Shane ushers the Troop out the door, then loads Peter and Tyler into TWO SNUGGLES -- one attached to his front, the other to his back. Shane closes the front door and attaches a "Club" lock to it.
77) 1) text: Shane Loads the brownies and toddlers into the minivan.
78) 1) text: Shane pulls the minivan into the crowded parking lot -- the Brownies are all singing 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall at the top of their lungs.
79) 1) text: Shane (double-Snuggled) helps the Brownies set up a card table to display their cookies.
79) 3) dialog: I gotta get supplies. I can see you through the window, but if anything happens...
80) 1) text: Shane watches the Brownies on the store's CLOSED CIRCUIT monitor, as he pushes a cart into the store. He looks around at the bright, colorful boxes of Children's Cereals, Rainbow Fruit Roll-Ups, Snack packs... NOTHING looks familiar -- nothing even looks like food.
82) 1) text: Shane heads to the Brownie's table -- but Lulu and the Brownies are gone. In their place are the Chubby Scouts.
82) 3) dialog: Where are my troops?
82) 8) text: Around his neck, Shane's monitor starts beeping. Shane takes off running in the direction of the signal.
83) 1) text: Shane runs up to the minivan. The Brownies are huddled behind it, trembling.
83) 3) dialog: What happened? (No one answers) Well?
83) 6) text: Shane eyes the Cub Scouts. Dead serious:
83) 8) dialog: Well then -- I'm afraid I have to eliminate them. If I don't come back -- avenge my death.
83) 12) text: Shane stops. He bends down, and points at Lulu's Panic button. He firmly tells Lulu, who's close to tears:
83) 14) dialog: This is not a toy. I'm here to protect you. Not cookies. Get in the car, we're going home.
83) 18) dialog: Where?
84) 6) dialog: I wish I were in Chechnya.
84) 15) text: Brownies are running around, playing video games and skee ball. Shane's watching Peter, in the PLASTIC BALL POOL, while he holds Tyler in the Snuggle. The Manager approaches Shane.

84) 24) dialog: What?
84) 27) text: Frustrated, the Manager picks up a pitcher and exits. Lulu approaches, she grabs Shane by the sleeve and drags him over to the stand up Mortal Kombat game.
84) 31) dialog: I'm watching your brother...
84) 34) text: Shane doesn't like the sound of that. He steps up to the machine. He cracks his knuckles, stretches. Then he takes a joy stick. He checks over his shoulder -- Peter's happily splashing about in the plastic balls.
84) 35) text: ON THE SCREEN: they each select a fighter. Lulu picks a small female character. Shane picks a man who looks LIKE SHANE. They begin, Lulu screams out with her fighter, in unison:
84) 44) text: She leaps over Shane in a somersault and throws a DOZEN throwing stars. Then kicks him in the head repeatedly.
84) 46) dialog: That's not fair. Nobody can jump thirty feet.
84) 50) dialog: That wasn't a documentary.
84) 51) text: The second round starts, Brownies have gathered around to watch. Lulu's fighter does a series of kicks. Shane can't even get one punch in -- she pins him to the ground, kneels on his head, then kicks him in the face. Shane is taking it really seriously. He's really mad.
84) 53) dialog: This isn't fair. My joystick's broken.
84) 56) text: They switch sides. Round three starts. Lulu's fighter picks up Shane's in the air, spins her, then cracks her in half over his knee... and then a kick in the face.
84) 58) dialog: (re: the Snuggle) You don't have a baby on your chest...
84) 59) text: Lulu's having fun now, she's just avoiding Shane's fighter, dancing, jumping, while he pounds the buttons, swinging and missing... Shane's really fuming.
84) 63) dialog: I AM TOO TRYING.
84) 66) text: She keeps dancing. It's really annoying. Shane's working the joy stick hard, slamming buttons, but he can't hit her. He is KO'd. She does a very obnoxious VICTORY DANCE.
84) 75) text: Shane screams and RIPS THE JOYSTICK OFF THE MACHINE. Sparks fly. Shane looks around to see if the staff noticed. He and the Brownies sneak away, leaving the sizzling machine, its joystick dangling by its wires.
88) 1) text: Shane (Tyler in Snuggle), loads Brownies into the minivan, counting them. Barking at them like Marines:
88) 3) dialog: Move, move, move! Go go!
89) 1) text: Shane drives, the Brownies are singing 99 Bottles... again. Suddenly, a look of horror comes across Shane's face... he spins the minivan in a 180 and floors it.
90) 1) text: Shane (Tyler in Snuggle) bursts in, the Brownies follow. We see what he forgot: PETER, still happily playing in the pool of plastic balls. The Manager is watching him.
90) 5) dialog: Inexcusable, to leave a man behind like that...
90) 8) text: Shane wades into the ball pool and pulls Peter out, which is fine, except that he's MISSING HIS DIAPER.
90) 20) text: Shane grimaces. He holds his breath, and goes down for the diaper. He disappears under the balls -- for a long time. The Manager and the Brownies share a concerned look. He's still down there. Silence.
90) 25) dialog: Clear out! GO GO GO!
91) 1) text: Shane is exhausted, as he pulls up in the Minivan. He gets out -- and groans in disbelief. It's insanity: HIP HOP blasts, gyrating TEENAGERS everywhere, chugging drinks, making out, peeing in the bushes, jocks throwing footballs.
91) 2) text: Reeling, Shane takes Lulu, Peter and Tyler up the path. He protectively guides them past the craziness -- until a football suddenly WHIZZES by. Outraged, Shane snatches it mid-air -- then CRUSHES the ball. POP!
91) 5) dialog: Party's over.
91) 6) text: The jocks flinch, scared, then RUN.   Shane unlocks the CLUB lock off the door.
92) 2) text: Shane drags the needle across a record at the D.J.'s turntables. Everyone recoils from the horrible sound.
92) 4) dialog: No one leaves until this house is spotless! I want to be able to eat off the floor! The latrine! Hell, I wanna be able to eat in the kitchen!!
92) 5) text: Nervous glances -- then everybody suddenly RUNS for the back! Shane is confused, trying to understand...
92) 10) text: Scott is halfway through the doggy door when Shane grabs his ankles and yanks him back in. Shane holds Scott upsidedown by his ankles.
92) 12) dialog: Oh no you don't. Now, we're gonna do this my way -- no highway option.
92) 13) text: Just then: A MUSTARD SOAKED BALONEY SLICE drops from the ceiling, sticking to the TOP of Shane's head. PLOP. Shane's eyes narrow, he takes it off, trying to maintain his dignity. He fumes...
92) 15) dialog: Start swabbing, ladies.
93) 1) text: Shane inspects the house, as kids clean. Shane wipes a finger down the sofa. Clean. He lifts the sofa, and rubs his finger UNDER IT. He holds it up to a KID... residue. The Kid quickly starts cleaning again.
93) 2) text: A GIRL reorganizes a stack of CD'S. Shane goes over them, straightening -- then he notices something. He pulls out a CD: It is a home-burned disk, labeled with a Sharpie. It reads: GHOST. Oh my god...
94) 1) text: Two DARK CLAD FIGURES watch, through binoculars. They see Shane find the CD, and walk out of sight.
95) 1) text: Shane quickly tucks the CD into his pocket.
97) 1) text: Shane works his way through the house. It's SPOTLESS: counter tops glisten, furniture polished. It looks like Better Homes and Gardens. He heads upstairs. Zoe blows past him -- into the bathroom, where she throws up. Shane sits down, outside the bathroom door.
97) 5) dialog: Those people aren't your friends. They show no respect for you or your house. Because you have no respect for yourself.
97) 8) text: ueasy, she pukes again. Shane hands her a handkerchief.
97) 10) dialog: You got barf on your tank top. (Announces:) Company, downstairs!
97) 14) text: Shane stops. Lulu and Todd step into the hall. Zoe gets up, shaky and furious, and screams in Shane's face.
97) 17) text: Silence. Lulu's crying, Todd picks her up. Shane stands, helpless. After a beat...
97) 26) dialog: You're right, Red 1. I'm not the man for this job.
97) 30) dialog: In all my years I have never been treated with such disrespect. Not even from the enemy. Don't worry, as soon as your mom comes back, I'm gone.
97) 33) dialog: Now what?
97) 37) dialog: Puberty... talking doesn't do any good. Go to your rooms.
97) 38) text: Suddenly, TWO NINJAS, all in black BURST in through the window. Shane spins in fight-stance.
97) 40) dialog: (to the kids:) Go!
97) 42) text: The Ninjas pull a retractable KENDO STAFFS. Wielding them with great skill. It takes all of Shane's skill to fend them off -- the three fight, close-quarters and fast. Until Shane pulls down attic's spring-loaded FOLDING LADDER and clocks a Ninja with it. He goes down, but Shane is SHOCKED from behind by the other NINJA. The Ninjas attack, fiercely -- they're good. Their Kendo staffs hiss with a powerful ELECTRIC CURRENT. The Ninjas knock Shane backwards down the stairs...
98) 1) text: There are TOYS EVERYWHERE -- like a tornado hit a TOYS-R- US. Shane fends the Ninjas off. He spots a BASEBALL BAT, and grabs it, facing them, fiercely. They step back...
98) 3) dialog: Okay -- who wants some?
98) 4) text: Shane swings the bat down on a Ninja's head: It's a whiffle bat, it makes a silly thunk. Shane and the Ninja share a surprised look -- then the Ninjas charge. Shane fends them off with his Whiffle bat. With his foot, he picks up a FISHER PRICE CORN-POPPER, and uses them both to fend off blows. It rattles and pops as he fights with both Toys -- until a Ninja breaks them with one blow. Shane sees a FARMER JOHN TALKING GAME. He jumps up onto a shelf and grabs it. He pulls the string, and swings the plastic disk like a deadly bolo.
98) 7) text: WHACK, he hits a Ninja in the head. He swings the Farmer John like a bull whip -- until a Ninja knocks the shelf over. Shane crashes down, toys fly, several FURBIES hit the floor. They echo the fight:
98) 10) text: Shane sees: The Ninjas are wearing only Ninja socks -- no shoes. He grabs a barrel of LEGOS, and flings them all over the floor. The Ninjas move towards him -- the Legos and Jacks dig into their feet.
98) 13) text: The Ninjas fight as they hobble around, avoiding Legos, Shane runs to the changing table, then violently squeezes DESITIN at a NINJA, blinding him.

98) 15) text: he other Ninja looks up, fearful. Suddenly he grabs a bottle of BABY POWDER. He sprays it in Shane's face... POOF! The room fills with a CLOUD OF WHITE.
98) 17) dialog: 
98) 22) text: He squints, blinded. The cloud dissipates... and Shane sees he's now alone. He runs to the broken window.
98) 25) text: The Ninja's are long gone. Shane bangs the window sill, disappointed to have lost them.
99) 1) text: Composing himself, Shane approaches Zoe's door.     He quietly knocks.
99) 3) dialog: Kids.   It's safe. You can open up.
99) 4) text: A long pause -- then the door creaks open. The kids run out and hug Shane with all their strength, bawling. Todd and Zoe enter, terrified. Shane isn't sure what to do... Then, he hugs Peter and Lulu. He really hugs them.

99) 9) text: He hugs them, even Zoe is crying and hugging Shane.

99) 29) dialog: But I can't do this without your help, okay? We need a little more cooperation here. (the Kids nod) Tell you what -- let's start over. From now on, you listen to me, and do what I say. (to Zoe and Todd:) And I... I'll listen to you too. Deal? Truce -- okay?
99) 30) text: Zoe and Todd nod. Shane offers his hand to shake. They shake -- then they hug him, too.

100) 7) text: Zoe laughs: she can't help it, it's been a long night. Then, the other kids join in. Soon, even Shane is laughing too: the telephone RINGS -- they all jump, startled. Zoe answers it, all smiles, she tries to play it cool and not frighten her mother:

100) 12) dialog: Mrs. Plummer... two men tried to get into the house tonight.

102) 3) dialog: I gotta warn you guys: From now on, I'm gonna be sticking even closer.

105) 1) text: The TEACHER hangs a series of cute "Turkey Hand" drawings above the blackboard (the kind where your fingers make the feathers). She hangs one of a HUGE HAND, and smiles at Shane, who sits in the back, sunglasses on. Shane nods, "yeah, I know it's good." Then...
106) 1) text: Shane enters. Zoe sits in a folding chair, mortified. She is holding a broken-off SIDE VIEW MIRROR. Murney stands, Principal Claire next to him. They look concerned.
106) 3) dialog: Don't worry. So, she wrecked a driver's Ed. car -- she'll pay for the damage...
106) 7) dialog: Red two? I mean Todd?
106) 8) text: Claire nods. Shane gives Zoe a look. Zoe shrugs.
106) 12) dialog: Has he been skipping class?
106) 15) text: Murney calls into the hallway. Todd enters. Shane stops, in shock: Todd's long hair is all shaved off, he now has a bleach blonde BUZZ CUT, giving him a "skinhead" look.
106) 25) text: Murney hands Shane a book and Shane flips through it. It's a book of photographs of NAZI UNIFORMS. Shane scowls.

107) 3) dialog: Wait Todd, I want to talk to you...

110) 63) dialog: Come on. Julie Andrews was hot.
110) 71) dialog: You know what girls think is weird? Wrestling. Men in leotards pinning each other to the floor? I've never understood that. Chicks dig guys who can dance.
110) 74) text: Shane looks at the Cast, they look pretty glum as they pack up their costumes. Todd looks devastated -- only a moment after Shane saw him happier than ever. Shane straightens up, grabbing Todd by the shirt collar. BEAT.

110) 77) text: Everyone looks around, they're not sure what to do... off Shane's glare, they quickly assemble on stage.
110) 79) dialog: DO YOU, OR DO YOU NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO PERFORM THIS MUSICAL?
