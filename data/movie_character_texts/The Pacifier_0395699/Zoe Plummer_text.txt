58) 5) text: BINOCULARS P.O.V. as Shane goes from window to window of the school: Zoe is glaring at him through the window from her seat in a class. Todd, sitting in the back row of a class, yanks his hood over his head. Lulu waves from 2nd Grade, delighted.

59) 40) dialog: Kick his butt, Todd!
66) 1) text: He turns a corner -- a PLYWOOD WALL surrounds the site. He leaps out of the minivan. He looks at the tracker: Zoe and Todd are dead ahead, through the fence.

68) 4) text: It's horrific. The DOTS BEEP LOUDER. He's almost there! He splashes around a corner -- then gasps -- he sees the blinking lights below the surface. He takes a deep breath and dives under. He comes up for air with ZOE and TODD'S HOMING BEACONS. A note is tied to them: "Ha! Ha!"
69) 2) text: Then the door swings open, revealing Shane, looking like a Swamp Creature. Everyone gasps, then covers their noses. A CUTE YOUNG COP enters behind Shane. Todd stiffens. Zoe fixes her hair. The Cop looks at them.
69) 8) text: The Cop leaves, Zoe checks him out as he goes...
69) 16) text: She practically GAGS as she passes him. Shane looks around at Scott and Zoe, he doesn't say anything, but with his hand he makes a "my eyes on you" gesture.
75) 1) text: The Brownies are in the living room, unpacking boxes of cookies, getting ready to go. Zoe's on the phone.

87) 1) text: As Zoe hangs up, we WIDEN OUT: The house is PACKED with TEENAGERS: they're keeping quiet until the phone is in its cradle, then the TEENAGE DJ starts the music back up.
87) 2) text: Zoe looks around at the mess. She turns to Scott, who doesn't seem concerned at all.
87) 4) dialog: Dude, this is outta hand. Who are all these people?
87) 11) text: Zoe rolls her eyes, then notices a WEIRD SWEATY KID, who's throwing mustard covered baloney slices at the ceiling, where they stick with a satisfying SQUISH.
87) 13) dialog: Dude, not cool...
92) 1) text: Inside is worse, a total wreck.   Zoe's dancing with Scott.
92) 21) text: Miserable TEENS scrub. In a bathroom, Scott and Zoe, in Playtex gloves, furiously clean. Scott scrubs the toilet with Pinesol as the Duck swims in the top of the toilet.
92) 25) dialog: It was YOUR idea! I don't even know most of these losers.
97) 1) text: Shane works his way through the house. It's SPOTLESS: counter tops glisten, furniture polished. It looks like Better Homes and Gardens. He heads upstairs. Zoe blows past him -- into the bathroom, where she throws up. Shane sits down, outside the bathroom door.
97) 3) dialog: ... Thanks a lot, Rambo. My friends will never come here again.
97) 7) dialog: I do too respect myself.
97) 13) dialog: You're not my dad!
97) 14) text: Shane stops. Lulu and Todd step into the hall. Zoe gets up, shaky and furious, and screams in Shane's face.
97) 16) dialog: We hate you, you hate us. You're like a robot. Why don't you just leave us alone?
97) 35) dialog: (sighs, tired) It's Scott...
97) 41) text: Terrified, Zoe and Todd scoop up the kids and rush down the hall.
99) 1) text: Composing himself, Shane approaches Zoe's door.     He quietly knocks.
99) 4) text: A long pause -- then the door creaks open. The kids run out and hug Shane with all their strength, bawling. Todd and Zoe enter, terrified. Shane isn't sure what to do... Then, he hugs Peter and Lulu. He really hugs them.

99) 11) dialog: I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.
99) 19) dialog: So Mom's not paranoid? There really are people out to get us.
99) 27) text: The kids shudder, relieved. They hug him tighter. He looks Zoe, eye to eye. He dries her tears:

100) 7) text: Zoe laughs: she can't help it, it's been a long night. Then, the other kids join in. Soon, even Shane is laughing too: the telephone RINGS -- they all jump, startled. Zoe answers it, all smiles, she tries to play it cool and not frighten her mother:
100) 9) dialog: Hey mom we're fine, absolutely nothing happened you should worry about. Nope.
104) 1) text: Driver's Ed. An obstacle course with cones. Zoe nervously drives a small sedan, a crazed TEACHER next to her. He is gesticulating, SCREAMING, reacting each time she HITS the gas, then BRAKES, HITS the gas, then BRAKES.

111) 5) dialog: (embarrassed) Nothing... It's stupid... Scott. I called him in his room, another girl picked up the phone. I know it's no big deal. I don't know why I let it get to me.
111) 9) dialog: It's just nice to think someone's thinking about you, you know?
111) 13) dialog: ... No wait! ...What are you gonna do? You're not gonna hurt him are you? Promise you won't touch him.

137) 12) dialog: A month...
137) 16) dialog: You're okay, Shane. I'm not used to anyone giving me the benefit of the doubt. My teachers don't trust me. Mom doesn't. My dad didn't care about us, he was never here...
137) 38) text: Zoe's eye well up, then she cries. Shane holds her.
137) 40) dialog: I miss him so much...
