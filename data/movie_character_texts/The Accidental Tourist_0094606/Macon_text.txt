He remembers the phone is out of order, but checks it at his ear for a moment anyway. He rises and pulls at the cord and leans over the bureau to peer down at where it is jacked to the wall. He puts the phone down and moves the heavy bureau a few inches away from the wall. He reacts to a twinge in his back, but shakes it off and stoops down toward the jack. There is a barely-audible little CRACK. And Macon freezes in his stooped position. His back has gone out, but he doesn't want to believe it. And if he doesn't move he won't be sure.

In fact, there is some kind of peace in the memory and the forward movement of the Boy and the taxi. The taxi approaches Macon's hotel. A Man is just emerg- ing with a small anxious dog on his arm. And there on the curb stands Muriel, surrounded by suit- cases and string-handled shopping bags and cardboard cartons overflowing with red velvet. She is frantically waving down taxis -- first one ahead, then Macon's own.

She smiles for a moment at the Driver and her eyes sweep over Macon -- not registering him -- as she turns to begin collecting her bags. Macon watches, suspended in the moment, with a kind of joy. Suddenly, Muriel's mind registers what she has glimpsed in the shadowy back seat. She straightens and turns, very slowly it seems to Macon. And now a much larger smile lights her face. Her gaze locks directly onto his -- and where they meet, there is a blinding, white burst of light.
