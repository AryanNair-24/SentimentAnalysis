4) 3) dialog: Putting on my glasses would help you to see?

4) 7) dialog: You're not a comfort, Macon.
4) 9) dialog: You just go on your same old way like before. Your little routines and rituals, day after day.
4) 11) dialog: Well, I just do, sometimes. A wide lake in the center of the highway crashes against the underside of the car. Macon pumps his brakes.
4) 12) dialog: Do you suppose that person has any idea? I want to go see him in prison, Macon. I want to say, "Look at me. Look. Look at what you did. You didn't just kill the people you shot. What you did goes on and on forever. You didn't just kill my son, you killed me, you killed my husband. Do you understand what you did?" Then when I'm sure that he does understand, that he feels just terrible... I'm going to open my purse and pull out a gun and shoot him between the eyes.

In the kitchen, Sarah's legs WIPE PAST Ethan sitting 50 on the floor gently brushing a becalmed Edward. In the backyard, TRACKING WITH a soccer ball as it rolls across the lawn. Edward catches up to it, crazed, and shoulders into the hedge, GROWLING ferociously. Across the yard, Ethan watches delighted, head thrown back, his laughter high and clear, but seeming now to grow EVER MOR DISTANT. He turns TO LOOK AT CAMERA, at what must be --

57) 16) dialog: Yes, blood. Playing that ridiculous card game no one else can fathom. Cruising hardware stores like other people cruise boutiques.
57) 18) dialog: Picking apart people's English. Have to have their precious baked potatoes every night.

57) 26) dialog: Macon, ever since Ethan died I've had to admit that people are basically bad. Evil, Macon.

57) 33) dialog: This whole last year I felt myself withdrawing from people. Just like you do, Macon -- just as you do, sorry. I felt I was turning into a Leary.
57) 35) dialog: I can't afford it. I live in this apartment you'd hate, all clutter. I've made a whole bunch of new friends, and you wouldn't like them much either, I guess. I'm studying sculpture again. I always did want to be a sculptor, only teaching seemed more sensible. That's how you would think: sensible. You're so quick to be sensible, Macon, that you've given up on just about everything.
57) 37) dialog: Everything that might touch you or upset you or disrupt you. (CONTINUED)
57) 41) dialog: When Ethan died, you emptied his closet and his bureau as if you couldn't be rid of him soon enough. You kept offering people his junk in the basement, stilts and sleds and skateboards, and you couldn't understand why they didn't accept them. Macon, I know you loved him but I can't help thinking you didn't love him as much as I did, you're not so torn apart by his going. Macon reacts to that with an infinitesimal flinch. Sarah sees it, but drives on --
57) 42) dialog: I know you mourned him but there's something so... what-do-you-call, so... muffled about the way you experience things. It's like you're trying to slip through life unchanged.
57) 44) dialog: If you really think that, then you're fooling yourself. You're encased. You're like something in a capsule. Macon, I'm sorry, but it's not by chance you write those silly books telling people how to take trips without a jolt. So they can go to the most wonderful, exotic places and never be touched by them, never feel they've left home! That traveling armchair isn't just your logo -- it's you.
57) 48) dialog: So anyway. This is what I wanted to tell you: I'm having John Albright send you a letter.
57) 50) dialog: He's an attorney. (she looks at * him a moment ) . I'm sorry if this hurts, Macon. I'm sorry -- She changes her mind about whatever she was going to say. She stands up and walks out. Macon watches her go, then, very carefully, begins to eat.

161) 44) dialog: You could have stopped her if you'd really wanted. You could have taken steps. They fall silent. Sarah rises and begins clearing away their supper. Macon watches her move around the room. It's hard to tell if the pain in his eyes is coming from his back or something less physical. Sarah opens a pill bottle, shakes a white pill into her palm and brings it to Macon. Her eyes barely meet his as she hands him the sleeping pill and turns away. Macon closes his fist around the pill and lets it rest on the blanket. Sarah goes into the bathroom. She is upset. When she catches sight of herself in the mirror, she is startled and a little embarrassed. She sees Macon's reflection in the mirror watching her and, almost reflexively, pushes the bathroom door halfway closed to obliterate his view. Macon slowly lowers himself down into the bed, and suddenly the CAMERA is CLOSE ON him in_exactly the same i i i at the start of their affair. And like then, Macon lies in bed and HEARS: Sarah running water in the bathroom, moving about the room as she gets undressed and hangs her clothes, the TINKLING of the chain as she slips it on the door, the SWITCHING OFF of the lights. The bed moves and Macon's back stabs pain as Sarah slips in beside him, but he makes no sound. He listens te Sarah's breathing as it softens almost immediately.
164) 1) dialog: Macon? He turns to look at her in bed.

164) 15) dialog: Macon? Are you just trying to get even with me for the time I left you? Macon returns with the shaving kit.
164) 17) dialog: I suppose you realize what your life is going to be like. She climbs out of bed and comes over to stand next to him in her nightgown, hugging her bare arms.
164) 18) dialog: (without heat) You'll be one of those mismatched couples no one invites to parties. No one will know what to make of you. People will wonder whenever they meet you, "My God, what does be see in her? Why choose someone so inappropriate?" And her friends will be asking the same thing about you.
164) 23) dialog: (very calm) I thought this might happen.
