Don't you just hate that name? But anyhow, I answered the ad. I told them that to be honest, I didn't like animals but Mr. Quarles, the owner, he told me that was just as well. He told me it was people who got all mushy about them that had the most trouble.
45) 14) dialog: Who's the lady?

45) 39) dialog: That will be fourteen forty, including the leash and the choke chain. You have to practice what he's learned, and no one else can practice for you. Macon counts out some bills and all his change.

48) 5) dialog: Next time; I'll stay longer and talk. That's a promise. Muriel trills her fingers at him, and clicks off toward a car parked down the street -- an aged, gray, boat-like sedan. She slides in and slams the door -- there is a sound like falling beer cans. The engine TWANGS and RATTLES before it takes hold. Macon watches her go. MACON'S V.O. {same guidebook tone) It is an unfortunate fact that even the most conscientious traveler cannot be prepared for every encounter. At such times, one must remain calm and rely upon one's innate common sense.

51) 17) dialog: You think it's weird I didn't mention Alexander, don't you? You think I'm some kind of unnatural mother.
51) 19) dialog: You're not going to give me another thought, are you, now you know I've got a kid. You're like, "Oh, forget it, no point getting involved in that." As Muriel's voice grows shriller, the hair on Edward's neck begins to stand up. The dog's lip begins to curl and he starts a low GROWL.
51) 20) dialog: You wonder why I didn't tell you about Alexander right off. Well, isn't it obvious? Don't you see what happens when I do? Muriel looks down at the dog and stops speaking. She taps her foot twice, but Edward rises from his sitting position, a distinct hump between his shoulders.
51) 21) dialog: Down. With a BELLOW, Edward springs at her fate, every tooth bare and gleaming. Muriel instantly raises the leash. . He stops barking and starts making GARGLING SOUNDS.
51) 27) dialog: See that? When they lick their lips it's a sign they're giving in. Doggie, Do taught me that. Macon stands up, shaking.
51) 29) dialog: Huh?

69) 17) dialog: Did you see Towering Inferno? Boy, after that you couldn't get me past jumping level in any building. JI think people who go up in skyscrapers are just plain brave. I mean if you think about it, Macon, you have to be brave to be standing where you are right now. : This stops Macon cold for several beats.
69) 19) dialog: No, I'm serious.
69) 21) dialog: You just say that because you don't realize what you went through before you stepped into the elevator. See, underneath you said, "Okay, I'll trust it." Why, you ought to be walking around that building so amazed and proud of yourself! Macon gives a small, dry laugh and grips the receiver more tightly.
69) 22) dialog: Now, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go get Edward and take him to the Meow-Bow. Then when you get back from your trip, we need to talk about his training. I mean, things just can't go on this way, Macon.

If you want to know the truth, the baby was the reason we got married. (checks Macon's reaction, then indicates the dog) Now I'm going to turn my back, and you watch how he does. Muriel wanders into the living room. She lifts a vase from a table and examines its underside. She sits on the couch and raises one foot in front of her, turning it admiringly this way and that. Her stocking bags at the ankle; she pulls it up.

Something went wrong while I was carrying him and they had to do a Caesarean and take him out early and I can't ever have any more children. Alexander was so teeny he didn't even look like a human, and he had to stay in an incubator forever, just about, and nearly died. Norman -- that's my ex-husband -- he said, "When's it going to look like other babies?" Norman always called Alexander "it." Edward WHIMPERS. He is just barely lying down -- his haunches braced, his claws digging into the carpet.
70) 8) dialog: Maybe you and Alexander should get together some time.
70) 10) dialog: He doesn't have enough men in his life. Maybe the three of us could go to a movie. Do you ever go to movies?

74) 4) dialog: Now, act like we expect no trouble. Just go along, go along, don't even look in Edward's direction. The Girl skims by them. Edward sniffs the breeze but marches on,
74) 6) text: They finally did let Alexander come home. Cried like a kitten would cry. And Norman would get this kind of stubborn look whenever I had to do something, go warm a bottle or something. I'd be hanging over the crib watching Alexander fight for air, and Norman would call, "Muriel? Commercial's just about over!" Macon watches her..
74) 7) dialog: And then one day Norman's mother came over to help him pack his clothes and he left me. She slows and then comes to a stop. Edward, with a martyred sigh, sits down at her heel.
74) 8) dialog: All that time Alexander was in the hospital seemed so awful, but now when I look back, I almost miss it. I mean there was something cozy about it. I think about those nurses gossiping at the nurses' station and those rows of little babies sleeping. It was winter and sometimes I'd stand at a window and look out and I'd feel happy to be warm and safe. I'd look down at the emergency room entrance and watch the ambulances coming in. You ever wonder what a Martian might think if he happened to land near an emergency room? (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
74) 11) dialog: He'd see an ambulance whizzing in and everybody running out to meet it, tearing the doors open, grabbing up the stretcher, scurrying along with it. "Why," he'd say, “what a helpful planet, what kind and helpful creatures." He'd never guess we're not always that way, that we had to, oh, put aside our natural selves to do it. "What a helpful race of beings," a Martian would say. Don't you think so? She looks up at Macon. Macon experiences a sudden twist in his chest. He bends and kisses her, surprising them both. Her fist with the leash in it is caught between them like a stone. Macon draws back.
76) 0) text: Muriel is driving her long gray boat of a car. Macon sits beside her. Edward is in back, his ears horizontal with joy as he sticks his head out the window.
76) 1) dialog: I got this car for only two hundred dollars. That's because it needed work. But I took it to Dominick, this boy down the street from where I live. I said, “Dominick, here's the deal. You fix my car up, I let you have the use of it three nights a week and all day Sunday." Wasn't that a good idea?
77) 0) text: Macon approaches the big window in front as though sneaking up on someone. He stops and looks. MACON'S POV. Edward is sitting obediently out on the sidewalk.

80) 3) dialog: Have you given any thought to coming to dinner?
80) 5) dialog: What else would it be for? She smiles up at him and tosses her hair back.
80) 7) dialog: Sweetie, this is Macon. Can you say hi? _ Macon holds out his hand. After a moment, Alexander shakes it weakly.
80) 11) dialog: He's used to it because he's had to go so often. He's got these allergies.
80) 13) dialog: He's allergic to shellfish, milk, eggs, and most vegetables. Also, dust, pollen and paint, and we think maybe he's allergic to air. Whenever he's outside a long time he gets these bumps on any uncovered parts of his body.

87) 2) dialog: Just sleep. Lie down and sleep. We begin a SERIES OF SHOTS which DISSOLVE gently into each other with a wooziness that matches Macon's exhaustion: Muriel removes his duffel coat and hangs it on a hook in a closet curtained with a length of flowered sheeting. She kneels and unties his shoes. He steps out of them obediently. She unbuttons his shirt as he stands with his hands at his sides. She hangs his trousers over a chair back. He drops onto the bed in his underwear and she covers him with a thin, withered quilt. CLOSE ON Macon as he lies in bed and HEARS: Muriel moving about the small house, shutting off lights, running water, murmuring something in the bedroom across the hall. When he hears her come back into the room and close the door, he is just able to look at her over the quilt: Muriel stands in front of the bureau with its old mirror. She CLINKS her earrings into a dish. Her robe is old, shattered silk, the color of sherry. She switches off the lamp. Then she comes over to the bed, lifts the quilt and slides under it.

151) 0) text: It is still dark out as Macon wakes and turns off his alarm. He lies there waking up, then remembers the bus- iness of the day. He seems to be mulling the Muriel issue with some odd good humor. He decides he will let her go with him. And he cannot suppress a smile as he sits up and reaches for the phone. He remembers the phone is out of order, but checks it at his ear for a moment anyway. He rises and pulls at the cord and leans over the bureau to peer down at where it is jacked to the wall. He puts the phone down and moves the heavy bureau a few inches away from the wall. He reacts to a twinge in his back, but shakes it off and stoops down toward the jack. There is a barely-audible little CRACK. And Macon freezes in his stooped position. His back has gone out, but he doesn't want to believe it. And if he doesn't move he won't be sure. After several moments of delay, he slowly straightens. The pain zings into him. He is barely able to make his way back to the bed and lower himself inch by inch onto it.

She smiles for a moment at the Driver and her eyes sweep over Macon -- not registering him -- as she turns to begin collecting her bags. Macon watches, suspended in the moment, with a kind of joy. Suddenly, Muriel's mind registers what she has glimpsed in the shadowy back seat. She straightens and turns, very slowly it seems to Macon. And now a much larger smile lights her face. Her gaze locks directly onto his -- and where they meet, there is a blinding, white burst of light.
