They look expectantly toward the kitchen door. Rose enters holding the turkey high on a platter as if in triumph. Odd since the bird looks bad, its breast caved in, its skin dry and dull.
73) 2) dialog: I just wish my neighbors could see this.
73) 6) dialog: Come again?
73) 13) dialog: I think it looks delicious.

89) 13) dialog: She's got to. I am thirty-six years old, Macon, but I tell you, I feel like a schoolboy about that woman. You may laugh at this, but I love the surprise of her. And I'm surprised by myself when I'm with her. I'm not exactly the person I thought I was! Macon looks up sharply at Julian. Some vividly responsive chord has been struck.
89) 14) dialog: I'm afraid I'm gushing. Want to know something? I've never even slept with her.
89) 16) dialog: I want us to have a real wedding night. I want to do everything right. God, Macon, isn't it amazing how two separate lives can link up together? I mean two differentnesses? This thought, so nakedly expressed, seems to jolt Macon. He becomes even more disconcerted.

132) 6) dialog: And not even for any reason! Our marriage was working out fine. But she's worn herself a groove or something in that house of hers, and she can't help swerving back into it. . (he looks at Macon) At least, I can't think of any other explanation.
132) 12) dialog: Job?
132) 14) dialog: Well, sure, but --
132) 16) dialog: No, you're right.
132) 18) dialog: (hands it over, distracted) You're absolutely right. Macon opens it and reads the topmost letter.
132) 23) dialog: Macon.
132) 25) dialog: Macon, I just want to say this -- I care about that sister of yours more than anything else in the world. It's not just Rose, it's the whole way she lives, that house and those turkey dinners and those evening card games. And I care about you, too, Macon. You're my best friend! At least, I hope so.
