89) 2) text: He closes his eyes. ISHMAEL (a murmur) Think of reading it.
89) 15) dialog: Milholland's report was like her letter.  Something no one else. Would ever read.
89) 17) dialog: Thing about having only one hand. It's hard to tear pages up.  And I wasn't carrying a match.
89) 19) dialog: So I thought of my father.  The man who would have taken this report to Judge Fielding.
89) 21) dialog: But every reporter.  Chooses his own balance.  FInds the facts that matter.
89) 23) dialog: After all, the freighter was only a theory.  It proved nothing at all.  There were other facts. That mattered.

99) 18) dialog: Two.  Lanterns.
99) 21) text: Ishmael leans back.  Against the door.
99) 22) dialog: It's the sheriff's math.  I'm wondering about.

100) 33) text: With all his strength.  Ishmael begins to climb. ISHMAEL (grunting) Trial's over, Sheriff, it's with the jury now.

102) 13) dialog: You're wondering why I held it.
102) 17) dialog: Yes, he was.
102) 20) dialog: To my father.  Everything counts.
103) 4) text: See Ishmael.  Quiet, intense.  On the witness stand.
103) 6) dialog: Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was Carl's boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
103) 9) dialog: That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
103) 11) dialog: Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
103) 13) dialog: ...where did it go?
103) 15) dialog: Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
103) 23) dialog: That's when he fell.
103) 25) text: Ishmael settles in.  Here we go.
103) 26) dialog: Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
103) 28) dialog: He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
103) 30) dialog: Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
103) 32) dialog: Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And that makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
103) 34) dialog: Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
103) 37) dialog: Coroner found an empty knife sheath on Carl's belt.  But they never found the knife.
103) 39) dialog: He climbs up.  His hand wound still bleeding.  That's the blood I found on the mast.  And the twine.
103) 41) dialog: He cuts the lantern free, the freighter's wake hits, the boat rolls hard, his bloody hand slips. tracing blood along the mast...
103) 43) dialog: He falls.  The lantern, the knife, go into the water.  Same as Carl.
103) 45) dialog: And inside the cabin, a coffee cup falls off the counter.
103) 47) dialog: But there's no one around.  To pick it up.
103) 50) dialog: The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
103) 53) dialog: He hit his head.  On the way in.
103) 56) dialog: The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
103) 58) text: Ishmael nods.  No smile at all.
103) 59) dialog: Anything.  That had a blond hair.
103) 68) text: There is a ripple of laughter.  But no smile on Ishmael's His game face is on.  Come and get me, sucker.  And Hooks come, one step at a time.  Straight to the box.
103) 70) dialog: I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
103) 73) dialog: Twelve.
103) 78) dialog: My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
103) 80) dialog: And journalism.  Is balance.  Finding the facts folks need to know.
103) 82) dialog: Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
103) 84) dialog: Oh, yes.
103) 86) dialog: But no other way.  To explain them all.
103) 88) dialog: And since they all happened. This is the only explanation that's the truth.
103) 91) dialog: Like you couldn't believe.
103) 100) dialog: He didn't want to lose any more.
103) 102) dialog: He'd lost a lot in the war, you see.  I had sent him away.  To a concentration camp.  But a nice one.  Far less brutal than the Nazis. Because I'm a civilized person.
103) 105) dialog: That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
103) 107) dialog: May I answer the question, Your Honor?  Anout the defendant's motivation to lie?
103) 109) dialog: I didn't say.  I did it alone.
103) 111) dialog: So there he was.  His father lost his health there, finally died. They lost more than Etta Heine's seven acres.  They lost their liberty, their dignity.  Their ideals about this country.
103) 113) dialog: They lost their trust in us.  We had treated them worse than animals. How would we now see tham.  As human beings?
103) 115) dialog: This man lost a lot in the war. He didn't want now to lose his babies.  Or the woman who loves him.
103) 117) dialog: And my expertise in this, sir.  Is that I lost a lot in the war myself.
103) 119) dialog: And the fact that I am the only witness.  Who placed his right hand upon the Holy Bible.  Is the least of it, sir.  I assure you of that.
103) 124) dialog: That's curious.  I was appealing to their intelligence.
103) 126) dialog: No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
103) 128) dialog: It's fortunate that the man who needs to prove his fancy story. Beyond a reasonable doubt.  Is someone else.
103) 130) dialog: I'm sorry, Mr. Hooks.  I apologize for my tone.  This is not a contest. Between you and me.
103) 132) dialog: For it is not.  As Mr. Gudmundsson so wisely put it.  A small trial. In a small place.
103) 134) dialog: I lost more in that war than anyone will ever know.  So did a lot of folks.  And what we got back in return...
103) 136) dialog: ...was a country.  Where a man was innocent.  Until we proved him guilty.
103) 138) dialog: Whether we all got cheated. We're about to find out.
