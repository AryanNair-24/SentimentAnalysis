SINESTRO. Hovering above him. Backlit against the Oan suns.
48) 1) dialog: Welcome to Oa. And then Hal passes out.
49) 6) dialog: In the grand sense, yes. First Ringflight triggers a manual return here to Oa for training.

49) 10) dialog: Thaal Sinestro. Protector of Sector Fourteen--
49) 12) dialog: A maiden voyage to Oa is taxing. We took advantage of your rest to accord you certain benefits.
50) 1) dialog: Knowledge of all Universal Sectors, including your own, Sector 2814, has been placed in your cerebral cortex. JUMP CUT TO: Hal’s body, SPINS as thick swatches of green black and white fly on to suit his form. SINESTRO (V.O.) (CONT’D) You've noticed your uniform, which designates you as one of our number. Hal’s head. The green DOMINO MASK is CRYSTALLIZING right him, turning his eyes WHITE. SINESTRO (V.O.) (CONT’D) The mask is protocol, required to be worn by all Lanterns from planets still ignorant of life on other worlds...
50) 4) dialog: (beat) Few Lanterns wear them.
51) 0) text: Sinestro moves towards the door, which EVAPORATES to allo his passage. Even their “doors” blow Hal (and us) away.
51) 1) dialog: Come. Cadets arrive at Oa with much to learn. You even more so. Being from Gaia gives you certain disadvantages.
51) 4) dialog: Is that what you call it now? Do you all still believe the planet is flat?
52) 0) text: A place for those who fly more than walk. GREEN LANTERNS LIMITLESS VARIETY fly and shoot and joke around. The BUILDINGS in the distance are tall as mountains. Liqu towers of living silver. The Emerald City of Oz is a dump by comparison. Sinestro notices Hal’s awe:
52) 1) dialog: I have seen sights in this Universe to make the blindest eye water, and I can tell you... there is nothing to compare with Oa. Hal is struck silent. Tomar-Re approaches.

54) 3) dialog: Green... the light you see, is only a manifestation of what your mind cannot comprehend.
54) 8) dialog: All life is connected. By love, by hope, by all the noblest instincts of the soul. This is the center of that connection. The power drawn from that connection is what you see simply as “green.” (gestures to the Battery) All that power... collected, channeled, here delivered. Entrusted to us. We can tell Hal is daunted by the grandeur of it all.
54) 9) dialog: Come, let us pay our respects. Sinestro motions toward a waiting LINE of LANTERNS. All manner of CREATURES assembled before a MAGENTA-SKINNED WO Abin’s widow, LIANA. Regal in her sadness. She sees them approach. Breaking ceremony she goes straight to Hal.

55) 1) dialog: You lied to her and think it kind. You are human. 45. Hal TOUCHES the base wall of the Battery, as he does his FLICKERS. A HOLOGRAM manifests, a rotating CORPS SYMBOL.

56) 2) dialog: Legion -- taking its revenge for offenses long forgotten to all but itself... And ou, the Guardians of our Universe.
56) 4) dialog: A Golden Light to match Legion’s. If our enemies command such power, we must too!
57) 1) dialog: We were given leave to find Legion.
57) 3) dialog: You are a member of the Corps now. You took an oath.
57) 5) dialog: The Ring chose you, Hal.
57) 7) dialog: Rings do not make mistakes. Lanterns do.
57) 9) dialog: Legion was in your sector, Hal. In your home system. If any trace of that demon fell to your planet along with Abin... it will ravage your homeworld like a cancer. A look crosses Hal’s face. Is it worry? He catches himsel

65) 1) dialog: Fellow Lanterns. Today we mourn the loss of our finest. Four of our brethren struck down by a single terror: Legion. The four images converge into ONE larger IMAGE OF LEGION. SINESTRO (CONT’D) Do not deny the truth of your own eyes. Legion is no myth. This image comes from the ring of Abin Sur himself. Proof of the unthinkable: The Lost Sector has been breached. Legion roams free. And it has a taste for your death. Alone we cannot defeat it. But we are not one Lantern. (a warrior'’s cry) We! Are! THE CORPS! CHEERS erupt. Sinestro ring conjures his trademark scimit Other Lanterns also conjure their own individual weaponry

103) 3) dialog: You can’t. Not alone at least.
103) 5) dialog: Would that it were...
103) 7) dialog: Legion is the Guardians’ shame. Sinestro extends his ring up and FIRES. IMAGES UNFURL. Beginning with: A GIANT BOOK, pages fluttering open.
103) 8) dialog: There are teachings in the Book of Oa the Guardians would not have us know. But moments we would prefer forgotten are still moments in time.
104) 1) dialog: In their efforts to protect the Universe, the Guardians sought to harness the emanations of light. But they did not begin with Will. They began with a force far more potent... With Will’s opposite. Their cumulative concentration culminates and... A Guardi swipes the air. A THIN YELLOW FLAME -- the color of Legio appears in his palm.
104) 2) dialog: Fear. The Guardian passes the meager flame to his neighbor. It grows. Until the flame becomes a BLAZE, burning one of th The blaze widens, beyond their circle...
104) 3) dialog: But the light of Fear could not be controlled. Even by the Guardians. The YELLOW BLAZE rips out of orbit towards the stars. A w of toxic light spanning Creation. SINESTRO (V.O.) (CONT’D) It spread. Throughout Creation. Taking what is good and polluting it with Fear. And all things changed.
105) 1) dialog: In trying to bring order to the cosmos, the Guardians unleashed chaos. The lizards’ expressions turn malevolent. Distrusting the brother. They ATTACK EACH OTHER with a new ferocity. SINESTRO (V.O.) (CONT’D) The Guardians saw their mistake. And they took action. They collected this light of Fear...
106) 4) dialog: ..-And, once gathered, they banished it.
107) 1) dialog: To the Lost Sector. A place of containment. A place to keep safe the Guardians’ failures. The yellow torrent is cast within. It spirals inside -- a cyclone of fear and rage. It twists and writhes, coalesci No longer merely a Light. But a Life. A nascent Beast let out a wild, PRIMORDIAL HOWL. SINESTRO (V.O.) (CONT’D) But in that dark place, the Fear grew strength. And form. And shape. The swirl of fire MORPHS into a very familiar shape: Legi SINESTRO (V.O.) (CONT’D) And its rage was legion. The HOLOGRAM FADES AWAY, as we TUMBLE down through --
108) 0) text: Sinestro leads Hal through an UNDERGROUND EDIFICE. A catacomb of CRYSTALLINE structure, repeated matrices of G CELLS stretching on into fractal infinity.
108) 2) dialog: That is why it hunts us. To take revenge on its captors. And creators. In answer, Sinestro SWOOPS down lower into the Sciencells SINESTRO (CONT’D) With the Guardians’ permission I led a phalanx of Lanterns to scour all sectors. Even with our combined efforts, our combined will, it killed thirty-three of our number.
108) 4) dialog: Yes. Sometimes victory comes at too high a price.
108) 8) dialog: The Lanterns do not leave evil unbridled. Sinestro opens a CELL DOOR -- and he shows Hal why he’s brought him here. Hal’s eyes go wide with surprise -- and horror -- at the sight of -- LEGION. Captured. Trapped by CHAINS OF GREEN ENERGY. A DOZEN LANTERNS (some wounded) keep a STEADY STREAM OF RINGFIRE trained on Legion. It thrashes and brays, strain with effort to escape the pain and confinement. SHRIEKING with a rage to make the Devil piss his pants.
108) 10) dialog: The Corps does not kill. Certainly not before Legion can repay its debt of death... (approaching Legion) The Guardians have seen enough death to permit what true and final security requires. The forming of a new ring. A more powerful one.

109) 31) dialog: Secure it!
113) 0) text: Hal flies fast, leading Legion away -- slaloms and twists weaving around the towers that rocket past. Legion just SMASHES through them. Pursuing relentlessly. Hal rockets HIGHER -- where SINESTRO flies to his side -- matching his speed. Hal couldn’t be happier for the help.
113) 3) dialog: No number of rings will be enough to slay Legion.
113) 6) dialog: Get out now! You'll die.
113) 19) dialog: Hal Jordan of Gaia came here seeking our help and saved us instead. (then) Today we show him how the Corps defends its own. For he has proven he is one of us. If his planet needs help... it will find us ready. It will see a storm! The Lanterns CHEER! Raising their Rings in unison!

SINESTRO stands his ground, awaiting the Sabre’s approach like a gunfighter. THE OTHER LANTERNS crisscross over the city. One stops a LANDSLIDE with a GIANT GREEN SHOVEL. Another rescues a family from a collapsing building. A SCHOOL BUS is set ri after teetering over an overpass. The PEOPLE’S appreciation overwhelms their fear of the strange creatures saving them...
