6) 1) dialog: Pilots are obsolete. We're watching the Sabre as it’s put through its paces on VIDEO playing on ALL FIVE FLATSCREEN DISPLAYS in:
7) 0) text: Smart and modern. Models of the SABRE in various design stages. CAROL FERRIS, braces long gone and replaced with MBA, mesmerizes A FEW SUITS and TWO GENERALS.
7) 1) dialog: I know conventional wisdom says planes can’t think like people. And I know conventional wisdom says U-CAVs aren’t ready for mass deployment. That the tech isn’t there yet. (beat) Conventional wisdom is for followers. Ferris Air is about to make all aerial combat missions unmanned. Today. The SUITS look intrigued -- except for one, who speaks wi the confidence of a former astronaut, current SENATOR.
7) 7) dialog: Enough to know pilots like you are few and far between, Senator. Most aren’t four-star NASA icons. Most pilots are far more human than that. There are pilots who are cocky... Pilots who are irresponsible... CLOSE ON: A WELL-WORN BOMBER JACKET on a floor. If it loo familiar it should. It’s the one Hal’s father gave him.
7) 8) dialog: And pilots who are both.
8) 17) dialog: It comes down to fear...
9) 1) dialog: All pilots are susceptible. It’s a human instinct. Train them for years, spend billions, you can’t get rid of it. And it’s fear that causes mistakes.
10) 6) dialog: End of the day, pilots are only human.
11) 0) text: Carol leads the SUITS into the ultra-modern hangar where even more ultra modern jet rests. A SABRE PROTOTYPE.
11) 1) dialog: Whereas the Sabres are more than human. Each has SAR/MTI and EO/IR sensors which feed into a sub-symbolic neural net. These aren’t drones. They’re the chess machine that can beat the grandmaster.
11) 3) dialog: In that case... maybe you’d be willing to suit up and fly against them in our demonstration. The Senator decides to LAUGH it off. CARL FERRIS, himself older and crankier, sidles up to Carol. Sotto:
11) 5) dialog: I can handle him Dad. You worry about getting a backup pilot. You’re still missing your third.
11) 7) dialog: Really? Because I’m running out of shpiel and looking at an empty F-16.
11) 9) dialog: There are better pilots out there than Hal Jordan. Who show up.
11) 11) dialog: Three, two, one... 11. As they exit the hangar doors to the tarmac, on perfect c A SABRE BUZZES clean over all their heads!

14) 11) dialog: We’re making history with the Sabre today -- not even you can ruin my mood.
14) 13) dialog: It’s in your father’s honor, Hal.
14) 15) dialog: It’s beaten most of them already. He climbs up and into his jet. As he does:
14) 17) dialog: It wasn’t a night, more like three minutes.
14) 19) dialog: We'll see how hungry you are after you get your ass kicked. Fly safe.

17) 3) dialog: (to the Suits) The Sabres utilize the same targeting algorithms as your current U-CAVs, but the flying protocols are as close to human-grade as you can get... Hal's F-16 TEARS down towards the other two -- which are struggling in their own dogfight with Sabres 2 & 3. A LAS SPRAYS from Sabre 2, TARGET LOCKING right onto an F-16's tail. Sabre 2 births a MISSILE -- which EXPLODES out and
17) 7) dialog: For those keeping score, it’s now three against one. ALL THREE SABRES target Hal now. Hal pulls every move he think of -- SKIMMING THE TREES -- HUGGING the GROUND -- b nothing works. They’re flies on shit.
17) 13) text: Tom reads the screen, so does Carol. JUh oh.
17) 17) dialog: A coffin corner. Can they follow?
17) 22) dialog: Hal, the F-16 you’re flying is a nineteen million dollar aircraft --
17) 24) dialog: You're not. You won’t have enough oxygen up there! You’ll pass out! WARNING LIGHTS FLASH as the unimaginable G-FORCES overtak Hal. The SABRES are still right up his ass.
17) 26) dialog: Pull out! Now, dammit! Hal’s F-16 is a SPACE SHUTTLE barrelling the UPPER ATMOSPHERE. The Sabres start to SHUDDER -- but Hal has a harder time breathing. He RIPS off his MASK.
17) 31) dialog: (to Tom, defeated) Trigger a manual restart. The Sabres RESTART to return safely. But Hal is STILL CLIMBING. He begins to lose consciousness. A QUICK SERIES of FLASH CUTS: Young Hal watching his father’s plane tumbling from the sky... the BLAZE and HOR of the WRECKAGE itself. CLOSE ON HAL -- HE BLACKS OUT as his own engines FLICKER
17) 33) dialog: Hal! Wake up Hal! But Hal is out. His plane begins to FREEFALL TO EARTH! SPINNING WILDLY -- end over end with the SUN FLASHING in eyes as we TUMBLE WITH HIM --
17) 34) dialog: Dammit Hal, wake up! Carol (and the rest of us) have almost lost all hope when FOOM. The F-16’s engines COME TO LIFE, blossoming with light. The plane FIRES AHEAD, PEALING RIGHT OVER THE GROU
18) 0) text: Carol beelines for Hal, as he steps off his plane.
18) 1) dialog: How stupid are you?!
18) 3) dialog: You almost got yourself killed! And for what? To spite my father? (then) After all the times I stood up for you, the one day I needed you to come through.
18) 5) dialog: You’re grounded. Permanently. You want to see another jet, come to the air show. Carol goes to leave. Hal calls after her, payback:
18) 7) dialog: (you’re so fucked) If you’ll excuse me, I have to go call your mother. Back on Hal, the first sign of fear in his eyes...
22) 6) text: i No kidding. A coffin corner, Hal? i (off Hal’s look) I Yeah, we heard. Carol’s voice carries. i
28) 0) text: A grey day. Mourners gathered around Martin Jordan’s grav YOUNG HAL stares at the coffin. Carl Ferris stands at the foot of the coffin. Opposite Hal, on the other side of th grave sits YOUNG CAROL. An ocean of grief between them.
38) 7) dialog: Let’s get this over with. (off Hal, blank) The bet..? Dinner? Look, if you don’t want to do this --
40) 0) text: Big open windows, bigger drinks. Think Gladstones on PCH. Carol’s with Hal, who seems a million miles away.
40) 1) dialog: So how do we do this? Do I give you set up lines, or do you just start gloating with the entrees?
40) 8) dialog: You should be. You always find a way to screw up my life, but sinking our business... unhinging a revolution in aviation... that was classic.
40) 10) dialog: I’m curious, what’ Old flames, same argument. s the statute of limitations on blaming my father for everything bad that ever happened to you?
40) 12) dialog: We all lost something that day. My father lost his best friend. Not to mention your brothers, or your mom. But we all moved on --
40) 14) dialog: Excuse me?
40) 16) dialog: What didn't I? After my dad’s breakdown, my parents split up, the company nearly folded. Which led to me not going away for school. Which led to me missing out on all the things I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to see the world, not just the town I gr (finally) Life’s full of dis still no excuse to and selfishness.
40) 18) dialog: Because... when I matter what I do, searching for his ew up in... appointment, Hal. It’s wallow in self-pity feel why do you even look at you -- no I still see that kid Dad's parachute. 33. 34. The mixture of regret and pity hanging in the air is too for either of them. They go back to their meal.
40) 19) dialog: Since when did lobsters become impossible to open?
40) 20) dialog: I’ll get it for you. It’s okay -- She turns away to grab a waiter. CAROL (CONT’D) Waiter -- can I get a cracker, please? Hal reaches to help when FROM THE RING COMES A HUGE GREEN HAMMER which SMASHES HER LOBSTER! Splat! It tape measures back into the ring before she can see. Carol turns back:
40) 21) dialog: Oh, you got it. Thanks. Hal stares, stunned. He looks over to an EQUALLY STUNNED LITTLE KID at the next table. Hal shoots a look -- Did yo see that too? The Kid NODS -- Uh-huh. Hal rises.
42) 0) text: THE LITTLE KID from before stares, marveling at the site GREEN HAL weaving between the tops of sailboats, masts bobbing to and fro... From him -- PAN OVER TO CAROL. Who still sits. Waiting for Hal. Story of her life. She motions to a WAITRESS, sad.

63) 0) text: Where Carol lays into Tom --
63) 1) dialog: That’s late even by Hal standards. Behind Carol, HAL DESCENDS in full uniform. She misses it but Tom gets a full on holy shit view of Hal’s landing.
63) 7) dialog: Save it. I’m sure wherever you had to go was more interesting. Carol storms out. Hal shakes his head. Tom is slackjawed.
64) 0) text: A wide variety of VINTAGE AIRCRAFT are lined up. Delta Wings, F-16Cs, Warbirds, etc. Carol marches past them, he still full of steam, as Hal races to catch up --
64) 2) dialog: It’s not hard to figure out. We had our first serious conversation in years and your 12 year-old brain couldn’t take it so you bolted. By this point, they've arrived at a trio of F-16C FIGHTIN FALCONS. Three PILOTS descend, one from each cockpit.
64) 4) dialog: The air show’s tomorrow. They’re making sure the Senator’s F-16 is flight-ready.
64) 6) dialog: Well, that wasn’t exactly Plan A, but it turns out one of my pilots screwed the pooch on the flight demo. Meaning Hal. Who looks over the line of aircraft, eager.
64) 8) dialog: Well, let’s see... Not this one. Or this one. Not this one either... That’s the thing about being grounded, you stay on the ground. Gas ‘em up. She walks off. The Douches CRACK UP. Hal shakes his head, can’t win... then spots a way for his day to get worse:
67) 0) text: We see the SENATOR'S JET at the center and head of an elaborate formation. The man can fly. Carol, Carl, and Tom at the controls. Hal (miffed) and Na (transfixed) watch from the window. Carl keys his headset
67) 13) dialog: You boys ready for the Chandelle?
67) 16) dialog: At least he’s flying. And setting up for a knife-edge pass.
67) 24) dialog: Yes, Hal, I know. You could’ve done it better. 55.
68) 24) dialog: Stay there, Nathan! No thought to her own safety, Carol climbs onto the glass get him! CRACKS spindle even further. She reaches out and... HEAVES Nathan up, OVER TO SAFETY -- but... The momentum CATAPULTS her forward... further on to the sloooowly shattering window... and -- THROUGH IT! CAROL FALLS to the fiery ground below! Seconds become milliseconds. Death’s arms opening wide, until -- GREEN LANTERN catches her! Holding her close as he ZIPS h away from the rushing ground.

92) 0) text: Carol steps out to the roof. Where Green Lantern hovers, aura enclosed, a few feet above the roof.
92) 2) dialog: I’m glad. I wanted to see you, I didn’t know how. You don’t have a signal to shoot in the sky? Maybe a phone number? GL just smiles. He’s trying hard not to say too much, or give anything away.
92) 3) dialog: No, I guess guys who float all the time don’t have cell phones.
92) 5) dialog: So you’re still... a person? But how to you do... all that? She mimes -- Giant Hand. GL raises his ring hand.

92) 9) dialog: Not like you. I have... responsibilities here. I can’t just go jetting off to Venice for the first time right now.
92) 13) dialog: Me? Nope. For a girl who flies a lot I’ve never been anywhere.
92) 15) dialog: I always thought, you should never see Paris alone... And I counted on the wrong people to take me. Regret on GL’s face. Another failure as Hal. One more thi he can repair as the Lantern. He holds out a hand.
96) 1) dialog: Do you know what’s happening?
97) 0) text: Walking through the “Paris” lights, wandering its amazing streets, GL and Carol remain blissfully unaware of world events. Carol marvels at the level of beauty and detail.
97) 1) dialog: Do you have any idea what you’ve done for the world.
97) 3) dialog: We stopped believing something amazing was still possible. I’m not talking about the flying or Paris. I mean... what you are. Normal people... they disappoint.
97) 6) dialog: Most. You’re someone they can count on. When there’s nothing else left. Now everyone knows... there’s a hero.
97) 8) dialog: All I know is who’s here for me now.
