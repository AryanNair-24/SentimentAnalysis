2) 6) dialog: This is a newspaper. And I know it's ninety percent bullshit but it's entertaining. That's why I read it. Because it entertains me. If you won't let me read my paper, then entertain me with your bullshit. Tell me a story.
2) 9) dialog: (sighs) Where'd you do your probation?
2) 11) dialog: Right. The Valley. No cute little anecdotes about writing underage smoking cites at the shopping mall? Jake thinks. Bingo! He's got it.

2) 30) dialog: «+. amazing... Jake beams -- some story, huh? (CONTINUED)
2) 32) dialog: You're driving around the Valley with a fine bitch in your car for a year and the most entertaining story you got is a drunk stop? Never hit her up for some Code X in the back seat? Didn't tap it?

There's another three hundred and fifty cases on the log I can't clear. I'm supervising five officers. That's five different personalities, five different sets of problems. You, Officer Hoyt, if you got the guts to succeed, will be number six. I don't have time to baby-sit or hold hands. You have one day to show me who you are and what you can or cannot handle. You can't hack narcotics, feel free to work a pussy desk chasing bad checks. Hear me, Officer Hoyt?
6) 9) dialog: Good. Gonna show you reality. Think you can handle it?

6) 19) dialog: Good. Roll your window down. Can't hear the street.
6) 20) dialog: Stand by, because narcotics ain't about staying in the car and looking good. I bet you write great paper, Hoyt. (before Jake can answer) You do. I checked it out. Cover your area, cover your ass, but not necessarily in that order, right?
6) 22) dialog: How's the Espanol?
6) 24) dialog: Work on it. People'll be plotting the worst kind of shit behind your back.

7) 11) dialog: Kick back, kid... You're so in love it's comin' out your eyes. The day you bring the old lady to the office is the day you don't go home. If you don't hide your love deep inside, maggots out here will find it and chew it up. Jake realizes Alonzo is right. Alonzo hands him a card.
7) 12) dialog: That's our Chaplain, Lieutenant Conelly. Give hima call. Invite him and his wife over for dinner. He's a good guy and no dumbshit. You and your woman need any kinda help, call him. I'm serious. Jake takes the card. Kind of smiles.

9) 8) dialog: Shut up, dickhead! I'11 shoot your face off! Take the keys out of the ignition. Throw 'em out the window! The Driver does, quickly, as Alonzo jumps from the car, charges the Driver, shoves the gun in his face. These are just scared kids. The girl tries not to cry.
9) 9) dialog: Fork it over, smartman.
9) 13) dialog: The marijuana I just watched you purchase! The Driver hands over the foil pack.
9) 15) dialog: Shut up, dumbass. You're here now! Gimme that pipe! There's an ornate pot pipe on the floor mat. The PASSENGER picks it up. Reluctantly hands it to Alonzo.
9) 17) dialog: What else you got?
9) 19) dialog: Gimme those too. He gives him a squished packed of Marlboro reds. The kids realize Alonzo isn't your average cop. The girl sees Neto standing down the block like nothing is going on. She lowers her hands -- bad move.
9) 20) dialog: Control your suspect, Hoyt!
9) 22) dialog: Cry and I slap the eyes outta your face! Back to the Driver.
9) 23) dialog: You aware this is a gang neighborhood? That gives him pause -- no kidding -- Alonzo grabs his ear again, shakes. (CONTINUED)
9) 26) dialog: I see you here again, I take your car. You can walk home while your girlfriend pulls a homeboy train... Hear me, reefer addict?
9) 28) dialog: Thank you for your cooperation -- Safe your iron.
10) 2) dialog: They have no business being here. Sooner or later that little smart- ass white boy college puke is gonna get jacked. I saved his life.
10) 4) dialog: Sure did, buy your shit on campus. (beat) I like your moves. Someone trained you well. Jake smiles to himself. Alonzo opens the foil, sniffs -- (CONTINUED)
10) 7) dialog: Shitty dime. Check it out. He hands it to Jake. Who takes out a bud.
10) 8) dialog: See the small hairs? The undeveloped seeds. How it's all stems? Jake nods.
10) 9) dialog: It was picked immature. See how flat it is? Classic brick-pack Mexican. See how brittle it is? It's not bud season. It's from last year. Jake is amazed. Alonzo snatches the bud, crumbles it in the pipe, tosses aside seeds.
10) 10) dialog: To be truly effective, a narcotics detective must know and love narcotics. A good narcotics detective should have narcotics in his blood.
10) 12) dialog: You are.
10) 14) dialog: What? You a Mormon? A Jesus freak?
10) 16) dialog: (re: the pipe) This is your job.
10) 20) dialog: This isn't some kind of test. Take a damn hit.
10) 22) dialog: (laughs ) This ain't a review board. We ain't doing rails. Just leafy green bud. Jake stands firm, shaking his head.
11) 0) text: SCREECH! Alonzo stops in the middle of the street, pulls his gun, jams it in Jake's ear. CARS behind them HONK.
11) 1) dialog: If I was a dealer, you'd be dead. Turn shit down on the street and the Chief hands your wife a crisply-folded flag. Jake stares stubbornly at Alonzo. Alonzo pockets the gun. Lights the lighter. And takes a huge hit, blows smoke in Jake's face.
11) 2) dialog: I don't want you in my unit. Not even my division. Go back to Valley. Get the fuck out of my car. A staring contest. Jake decides to play the game.
11) 4) dialog: Alright. That's how it's done, son. -- And is racked with a spasm of coughing.
11) 5) dialog: Betrayed by your virgin lungs. (CONTINUED)
11) 10) dialog: It's cashed. INT. G-RIDE (ECHO PARK) - DAY Al2 They cruise in a strange otherworldly silence. Jake is clearly messed up, his head lolls from side to side.
11) 11) dialog: Shit, you took some man-sized hits. You gonna be okay? When's the last time you smoked out?
12) 1) dialog: Left that out of your service jacket. Knew you had secrets, everyone does. Didn't know you dig dusters.
12) 3) dialog: You know, dusted bud. Dippers? C'mon, dipped in P.C.P. Primos. Sherm, kool, P-dog, angel dust... Didn't you smell it? Taste it?
12) 5) dialog: Now you have. Remember the smell for next time. Think I'd inhale that shit? Jake is scared as hell, pale, sweaty.
12) 9) dialog: Gonna kick the shit out of Neto. Motherfucker's lacing crappy bud to get that unsuspecting return client. Hell with his mom, I'm deporting the bitch.
12) 11) dialog: Lieutenant's got our backs. We know a week before we piss.
12) 13) dialog: Chill and ride the high. You're an adult. You chose to smoke. Live with your decisions. You cool?
12) 15) dialog: Besides, no one put a gun to your head. Jake shoots him a look.
13) 1) dialog: Get your shit together. Alonzo and Jake cross to the door. Alonzo knocks.
13) 2) dialog: This is my Road Dog's pad. Wanna see what he thinks of you. (CONTINUED)
13) 6) dialog: You'll think of something stupid. The door opens revealing ROGER in a bathrobe, worn from years of hard living. He's happy to see Alonzo.
14) 0) text: Roger and Alonzo hug.
14) 1) dialog: Did I wake you ?
14) 3) dialog: Alright. Time to get my swerve on. Roger gives Alonzo a concerned look.
14) 5) dialog: I'm cool. People talk shit.
14) 7) dialog: I know. Thanks. They clink glasses. Jake doesn't. He stares into the liquid, enraptured by its smoky patterns. (CONTINUED)
14) 10) dialog: Jake, drink your medicine. Jake takes a sip and winces. Roger tugs Jake's goatee. Jake recoils.
14) 26) dialog: Then why are you cackling like a jackal?
14) 31) dialog: Don't listen to him. There's nothing to figure out. The street's a buncha senseless bullshit.
14) 35) dialog: Give up. You're too high, space captain.
14) 38) dialog: Think this greenhorn can handle undercover? Roger scrutinizes Jake a beat. Smiles and nods: yes.
14) 40) dialog: (laughs ) Bullshit.
14) 42) dialog: That lasted a week. Alonzo stands, shakes with Roger. (CONTINUED)
14) 45) dialog: Brother, I gotta get back in my office. Thanks for the snort, dog. What're you up to today? Roger gestures at the phones and beepers.
15) 2) dialog: He liked you.
15) 4) dialog: He's no snitch. He's a good man to know. C'mon, let's find some action in Niggertown. (off Jake's look) That's N-wordtown to you. What are you, Hoyt? You ain't pure whiteboy. You mixed?
15) 6) dialog: No shit? You're all dicked up. Jake looks green, tosses the cigarette out the window. Alonzo senses what's coming and SLAMS on the BRAKES, flings open Jake's door. Jake vomits. A beat of dry heaving. (CONTINUED)
15) 9) dialog: Okay, well's dry, kid.
15) 11) dialog: Wipe your chin. Alonzo hands Jake a handkerchief. Jakes wipes his sweaty face.
15) 13) dialog: You gotta learn how to party. To handle a high. It's a necessary job skill. I'm not kidding. It's an alcohol world down here. You gotta be able to hang. To get wasted and talk shit with sketchy sociopathic dumbasses and not pass out and get your shoes stolen.
15) 15) dialog: Oh, damn!
15) 22) dialog: Mmmm-mmmm. The brown woman is the fine woman. Give her ten more babies to push around. Thick and tasty. Love to get up in that... Your old lady white? Nordic cheerleader, right?
15) 24) dialog: I like my meat dark. C'mon, get in the car. OMITTED Al5
16) 1) dialog: C'mon, man. Open your eyes. You'll make it worse. Nothing.
16) 2) dialog: Sit your ass up. Hoyt! Jake locks bleary red eyes on Alonzo, jokingly:
16) 4) dialog: The Goddamn zig-zag man.
16) 6) dialog: You're a little bitty boot. Alonzo cracks beers for him and Jake. (CONTINUED)
16) 9) dialog: C'mon. It helps. Believe me. Gives you ballast. Jake takes one. Alonzo drives over the 6th Street bridge. Jake drops his beer, soaking his leg.
16) 10) dialog: Dumbass. He leans his head on the window pillar, feeling better. Jake's eyes absorb the street's tableau of unworldly beauty gliding by. Palm trees and sunshine. Paradise and hell in one. His lids begin to drift shut. Then Jake sees a flash of movement in an alley. Suddenly alert, he paws at the door handle.
16) 12) dialog: Siddown, Hoyt. Everything's fine.
16) 14) dialog: C'mon, relax. You're tripping. Jake grabs the gearshift, throws it in reverse. The transmission GRINDS, TIRES SCREECH. The ENGINE STALLS. Jake is out like a shot --
17) 1) dialog: Get your ass back here!
17) 3) dialog: Dumb-ass kid.
17) 16) dialog: He casually exits the G-ride with a smile, impressed by Jake's raw skill.
17) 18) dialog: Shoulda shot ‘em. Jake crosses to the Schoolgirl.
17) 21) dialog: Miss! Relax! Are you okay?
17) 23) dialog: Honey, it's just a nosebleed. Put ice on it. Don't be walkin' around here alone. Tell your cousins to get your back. You know what those piecesa shit were gonna do. Probably got AIDS. Why aren't you in school?
17) 27) dialog: You almost became a ditch party. Go home. Go home, now. She grabs her book bag and gets out of there.
17) 29) dialog: Unhook 'em. We're not racking up arrests.
17) 31) dialog: No. Get some shots in first.
17) 33) dialog: Hear that, bro? My dog, here, wants to lock you up. Been to the bootyhouse? Grabbin' ankles for the big boys?
17) 35) dialog: Kick back, who's-who. Alonzo finds rocks in one sock. Some twenties in the other. He pockets the cash and crack. Searches Crackhead #2.
17) 36) dialog: Where's your horn?
17) 38) dialog: So what's this, chief? Gonna make you eat it. (CONTINUED)
17) 41) dialog: You, stand up. Alonzo hauls Crackhead #1 to his feet. Unlocks the cuffs, tosses them to Jake. Crackhead #2 strains against the flexicuffs.
17) 42) dialog: (to Crackhead #2) You get to keep those. Want to go to jail or go home? He steers Crackhead #1 to a wall -- cocks his fist.
17) 43) dialog: Ain't the first honey y'all pinned to a wall, huh? Close your eyes. Crackhead #1 does. Alonzo knees his groin -- oof! -- He falls to the ground, whimpers in the fetal position.
17) 44) dialog: Lucky I got pressing business. Next time I cut your dick off and shove it up your ass. (pats Jake's back, winks) I'll leave you three alone for some quality time. Gonna grab some beer. Alonzo gets in the car, backs out of the alley. Jake watches Crackhead #1 whimper; Crackhead #2 writhes in the gutter. It's futile to beat these men. Jake takes pity, walks away.
18) 1) dialog: Wanna book sixty bucks? Where're the suspects?
18) 3) dialog: Get over it. You wanna go runnin' and gunnin', stay in patrol. This is Investigations. Leave the garbage for the garbage men. We're professional anglers. We reel in the big ones. Shoulda dished out some shoe leather. You'd have a big 'ol smile on your face.
18) 7) dialog: Man... The hell you doing running alone into an alley fulla cracked- out monkey-strong motherfuckers? Those hemorrhoids woulda killed you without mercy or hesitation.
18) 9) dialog: They lost their money, their rock, got beat down and now the eses from Trece Flats are gonna smoke ‘em. Jesus, what more do you want?
18) 11) dialog: Is that not justice?
18) 13) dialog: What's wrong with street justice?
18) 15) dialog: God willing. But it don't work like that. They wipe out the good folks. It's always school kids, mommies and ass-bustin' family men catching stray slugs in their noodles. You protect the flock by catching the wolves. And it takes a wolf to catch a wolf.
18) 17) dialog: You protect --
18) 22) dialog: Shut up, boot! Nothin' but shit ‘tween your ears. They build prisons cause a me! Judges have handed out fifteen thousand man years of incarceration time based on my investigations. My record speaks for itself. How many felons have you collared? Dickhead. Now that it's clear who's the boss, they drive in tense silence for a long beat. Alonzo digs in his pocket --
18) 23) dialog: Here... -- hands Jake the rocks he found. A beat.
18) 25) dialog: Good. I'm glad to hear that. Toss 'em in the glove box. Jake does, sees several more rocks under some papers.
18) 26) dialog: Comes in handy. Like a credit card. (offers Jake a beer) You earned it. C'mon. Jake refuses.
18) 27) dialog: No matter what I say, I want you to know, you did the right thing. Reminds me of when I could chase down anyone and rock their world. You're a good cop. You got fire. That was some amazing shit back there.
18) 31) dialog: That the choke hold I saw you applying? Isn't that a big no-no, procedure-boy?
18) 33) dialog: You did what you had to do. Alonzo gives Jake a beer and grins at him like a proud dad.
18) 34) dialog: You got a magic eye, Hoyt. You have a goddamn magic eye. Up your street I.Q. and you'll do some damage, crime fighter. They clink cans. Jake smiles.
20) 1) dialog: Did my probation here. Learned a lot on these blocks. Kicked some ass. Had my ass kicked.
20) 3) dialog: Yeah, back in the day. Been on the job thirteen years. Today's my date of employment. (CONTINUED)
20) 7) dialog: Thanks. Thirteen's an unlucky number. But I figure the seven to go cancel it out. Alonzo turns on McKinley. He reaches over, digs in the glove box. Pulls out a photograph and hands it to Jake.
20) 11) dialog: I had a few misconceptions when I started out. (notes a graffited wall) Shit's going down. See that?
20) 13) dialog: Crossing out each other's placas like that. Ghettoville and the Locotes are at war. (CONTINUED)
20) 16) dialog: Learn to read walls, not just street signs. Alonzo turns down an alley. Then pulls onto a boulevard. After a block, he pulls into a different neighborhood. Alonzo glimpses some pit bulls down a driveway. A beat later he points out a house.
20) 17) dialog: On the left. See that house? Dude named Spooky lived there. Mean old vato loco. Mexican Mafia. No one messed with Spooky. Even got respect from the cops. We'd keep an eye on his house. You like dogs?
20) 19) dialog: Rotties are good dogs. Dobermans are better. Spooky raised Dobermans. On my second week of patrol, when I was not knowin' shit, we roll by Spooky's one night. I observe this old, black fool named Too Fine, all drunk, beating the shit out of this female Doberman. Beautiful dog, seven months old. Too Fine's whoopin' her with a garden hose. This dog's just crying, shaking. I grew up with Dobermans. I was pissed. I tell my T.O. 'I'm gonna take him.' And my T.O. is like: 'No, no. It's cool.' He waves to Too Fine and this motherfucker smiles and waves back and keeps hitting the dog. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
20) 22) dialog: Thought I lost my damn mind. Tells me Spooky gave him twenty bucks to beat the shit out of it. My T.O., this good 'ol boy, looks me in the eye and says: 'Teaches ‘em to hate niggers.' Almost quit right there. Almost got out of that black and white and took the bus home. Jake looks at Alonzo.
20) 24) dialog: Just remembered that. Every time I'd seen it all, the street'd show me something even more twisted. I know you didn't see no shit like that in the Valley.
21) 1) dialog: Still up twenty. Your turn. Put your hood up. (CONTINUED)
21) 6) dialog: Ad lib, boy. Use your words. He pulls over. The Dealer rolls up to Jake's side.
21) 10) dialog: Fetch, boy. Fetch. Jake bolts from the car.
23) 0) text: The Dealer heads for the back. Where a door leads out to an alley. He reaches for the door handle. Jake tackles him. Gets the Dealer in a compliance hold and cuffs him. Alonzo enters the store, badges the owner.
23) 1) dialog: Love doing that, huh? Jake searches the Dealer as rows of display heads stare with blind eyes.
23) 2) dialog: Who you work for, shitstain?
23) 4) dialog: Bullshit. You crackin'. (CONTINUED)
23) 7) dialog: No rocks?
23) 10) dialog: I never come up short, fool. Open your mouth. The Dealer does. Sensing to not play with Alonzo.
23) 11) dialog: Lift your tongue. He does.
23) 13) dialog: Gimme a pen. Jake does. Alonzo grabs the Dealer's neck. Forces the pen in his mouth. Down his throat. He gags -- urgh! Vomits.
23) 15) dialog: Lookie those.
23) 17) dialog: That's Jimmy crack corn and I don't care. One, two, three, four, five... six. How'd you swallow that shit without water? (CONTINUED)
23) 21) dialog: Gonna act like a man or a bitch?! Got you cold. Wanna go to jail? Or go home? Gimme a name. The Dealer mulls it over.
23) 23) dialog: Who?
23) 25) dialog: Unhook him, Hoyt. (to Dealer) You on my team now. Be seeing you, homie. Jake unlocks the cuffs. Alonzo steps over the vomit and crack.
23) 26) dialog: And collect the evidence.
23) 28) dialog: You're learning.
24) 1) dialog: What?
24) 5) dialog: To who?
24) 7) dialog: Afternoon, Bob. It's Alonzo. Got your gang book? (beat) I need a res. Sandman from Mobsters... might be in custody. (beat) Okay, shoot. Alonzo jots the information on a note pad.
24) 8) dialog: Thank you, sir. That's gonna do it. Have a good one. Alonzo hangs up. Shows Jake the address with a grin.
24) 10) dialog: We go after the Sandman. Jake smiles.
25) 1) text: The G-Ride parks in front of a house. Alonzo and Jake exit. Alonzo pops the trunk. Inside is a microwave box, toaster, a boom box, a TV.
25) 5) dialog: It's unclaimed shit from property. I pass it out to informants, victims, witnesses. Help their families out. Alonzo fishes out an LAPD Windbreaker, "POLICE" across the back. Hands it to Jake.
25) 6) dialog: Wear that. Intel says his wife's in the residence with two female juveniles and a possible male juvenile.
25) 8) dialog: We gotta serve this search warrant. It's the Chinese take-out menu Jake handed him earlier.
