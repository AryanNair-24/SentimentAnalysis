Huge arc lights and floodlights illuminate the scene and men are hard at work A group of men are in discussion in a pool of light. Ther is a conversation, then one of the men breaks off and tak call on his cellphone. He is distant, not even the focal point of the shot. He puts his finger in his ear to hear call more clearly. He is too far away for us to see his reactions or expression but, when he cuts the call, he wa directly toward the car and the other men turn to watch h go. As he gets closer we see he wears a tie and heavy boots a heavy coat. He wears a hard hat. He finds a key fob and hits it. The lights inside the car glow in response. The man gets into the driver’s seat. He is in his thirtie a face made of stone and unused to expressions of emotion This is IVAN LOCKE. He sits in the driver’s seat for a few moments. He takes breath and we might guess (or we might not) that he has j had some important news. Is he scared, angry? He takes out his cellphone and looks, deciding whether or to make a call. He checks his watch. He decides there isn time for the call. He puts the phone away quickly and fir the engine. He shifts gear and reverses. We stay with him and will st with him intensely for the rest of the story. The car bumps over rough ground as Ivan heads for the big secure gates that open out onto the street. The construct site is massive and it takes a while to reach the edge of Trucks rumble and generators roar. This is Ivan’s world. The gates are opened by a guy in a high viz jacket. Ivan reaches the kerb of the road and indicates right as a ref But he doesn’t pull away. He realizes that this time he must choose which way he wi go. He has a decision to make but he is a man who makes a hundred hard decisions a day. Even so, he takes time. A massive truck pulls up inches behind him and its headli fill Ivan’s car. Ivan continues to make his decision as h indicator ticks away the seconds. The truck hoots its baleful horn, the voice of fate. Ivan hits the indicator to indicate left instead of right He turns left and joins light evening traffic. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 3.

2) 0) text: Ivan will now drive through city streets toward the M6 motorway, a couple of miles away. We will not blink as we study him as he drives... Ivan is now confronting the crisis in his head. On the si he was in a familiar place but now he is on a journey and must necessarily begin to consider the destination and th place he is leaving. His first decision is to make a phone call on his hands f car phone. This is an important component of the story so should take some time establishing the mechanism. He has long list of speed dial numbers, identified by names or locations. He speed dials a number labelled ‘Bastard’...
2) 1) dialog: Hello, can I speak to Gareth? We hear a woman’s voice from the hands-free phone. Many voices will come into the car during this story. The firs is a woman in her forties (GARETH’S WIFE)... GARETH’S WIFE (OOV) He’s not back yet. Can I ask who’s calling?
2) 2) dialog: Ivan Locke. GARETH’S WIFE (OOV) Can I say what it’s regarding?
2) 3) dialog: Concrete. Ivan takes a moment and decides an explanation would be pointless...
2) 4) dialog: Can you tell him it’s urgent and tell him to call me back. GARETH’S WIFE (OOV) Does he have your number?
2) 5) dialog: Yes. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 4. We hear children in the background and a TV. Ivan reacts the family sounds because the world of children and famil about to explode and he will be cut adrift from it foreve GARETH’S WIFE (OOV) What was your name again?

2) 8) dialog: No. Something has come up. I need to tell people... Ivan almost chokes on some unexpected emotion. It is a sh to us and to him, like undigested food hitting his gullet
2) 9) dialog: It’s urgent. A dog barks. GARETH’S WIFE (OOV) What?
2) 10) dialog: I said it’s very urgent. Thanks. He cuts the call and drives. The emotion that just struck him was a bad development so early. He has a lot to do in the next hour and a half and he must hold this together a all costs. He drives for a while to calm himself. Then, when he is sure he is ready, he makes another call... We hear a mobile phone answer message. The voice is BETHA early thirties... BETHAN’S ANSWER MESSAGE (OOV) Hi, this is Bethan. I can’t get to the phone right now, please leave a message. Ivan misses the cue of the beep by a second because he’s getting his voice straight. Finally...
2) 11) dialog: It’s Ivan. I got your messages. I’m on my way and I’‘1l get there. I’m in the car now. (MORE)
2) 13) dialog: It’ll be about an hour and a half unless there’s traffic. He takes a moment... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) It’ll be ok. If the nurses or anybody wants to talk to me I’m only on this number. Or if the doctors or anybody. It’1ll be ok. I‘ll get there. The traffic should be ok. He cuts the call. He drives and twenty seconds later his phone rings... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Ivan Locke. We hear a soft Southern Irish accent... A pause. A pause.
2) 15) dialog: I know it’s a shock but it will be ok?
2) 17) dialog: I will go through everything with you and it’1ll be ok.
2) 19) dialog: Yeah.
2) 21) dialog: It's a family thing.
2) 24) dialog: I don’t have a choice...
2) 26) dialog: Donal, I need you to just fix this up and be alright... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) And solid. Which you are. Which you are. Just from when the sun comes up tomorrow morning until when it’s all been pumped. I need you to hold it together. You won’t be alone. I can be on the phone. I‘1l talk to you every five minutes until the pump is finished...
2) 28) dialog: On the phone.
2) 30) dialog: I don’t think so.
2) 32) dialog: Three hundred and fifty five metric tons, two hundred and eighteen trucks. A disbelieving pause. A pause.
2) 34) dialog: I have no choice.
2) 37) dialog: I need you to just do this. A long pause.
2) 40) dialog: No one is dead. Donal, I need you to do this, ok? I need you to be there with enough stuff and the right heads when the sun comes up.
2) 42) dialog: You’re ok. You know how to run a pump, you know how to run trucks back-to-back and turn trucks back, you know how to test for slumps.
2) 44) dialog: It’s the same but more of it. You just do the same but for longer. Check it, slump it, send it back if it’s piss and pump it if its right. A long pause.
2) 46) dialog: I haven’t spoken to him yet.
2) 48) dialog: I know...
2) 50) dialog: I know.
2) 52) dialog: I know.

Ivan is a strong practical man and he i facing a crisis which is unfamiliar, but some things he c keep control of. Men like Donal he can handle. He drives some more but ten seconds later the phone rings...
2) 55) dialog: Ivan Locke.
2) 57) dialog: Where are you? When Bethan speaks she sounds scared to death and in pain She’s mid-forties, middle class...
2) 59) dialog: Did they say how long?
2) 61) dialog: What does that mean?
2) 63) dialog: I know but what does that mean? How long?
2) 65) dialog: Is there a bell?
2) 67) dialog: I don’t know, a buzzer or something to get a nurse.
2) 69) dialog: Are you ok?
2) 71) dialog: Tell them. Tell them.
2) 73) dialog: Is there a bell?
2) 75) dialog: When they put their head round the door, tell them you need the lavatory.
2) 77) dialog: Have you talked to anyone about pain?
2) 79) dialog: Stopping the pain. Have you decided.
2) 81) dialog: Just have whatever there is. Seriously.
2) 83) dialog: I don’t know. For the pain. Because fuck...
2) 85) dialog: Don’t think about that, get them to give you everything. If they ask, just say I want everything.
2) 87) dialog: Who?
2) 89) dialog: I can’t remember. The thing they put in your spine. A pause.
2) 91) dialog: Yes.
2) 93) dialog: Yes.
2) 95) dialog: The traffic’s ok. Just tell them to give you everything for the pain. I‘ll be there in an hour and a half. If anything happens, just shout as loud as you can.
2) 97) dialog: Tell them to close the windows. The traffic’s ok. Go to the lavatory. I'll be there. She begins to sob and we hear a whimper of pain.
2) 98) dialog: (CONT'D)
2) 101) dialog: I’m about to do that. I have a list of things I have to do tonight while I’m driving.
2) 103) dialog: Yes. Tonight, yes. A pause.
2) 105) dialog: That’s a question you’re asking probably because of the pain or something. How could I love you? The call is cut. Ivan drives on. He speaks softly to himself as he glances in the rear view mirror and sees hi own eyes... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) So. Hell. He must concentrate on the road. He flicks through his sp dial numbers and finds ‘HOME’. He is about to call but th phone rings.... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Ivan Locke.
2) 107) dialog: Hello Gareth...
2) 109) dialog: I won’t be on site for the pump tomorrow.
2) 111) dialog: The truth is tonight I’m going to become a father. A long pause. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) She’s in London. I have to be there.
2) 113) dialog: Yes.
2) 115) dialog: Yes, I heard.
2) 117) dialog: Donal will handle it. He is a good man.
2) 122) dialog: Like babies.
2) 124) dialog: No. Right now nothing is a joke anymore.
2) 126) dialog: No it’s someone else.
2) 128) dialog: Yes. I am the last person on earth. But it happened.
2) 130) dialog: I've made a decision. There is nobody else who could be with her. She has no friends in London and is a quite fragile person.
2) 133) dialog: And because the baby was caused by me. That is the decision I have made. I have not behaved in the right way with this woman. At all. I have behaved in a way that isn’t like me. But now I am going to do the right thing.
2) 135) dialog: It is the decision I have made. I’m not going to turn back.
2) 139) dialog: Yes. I have no explanation apart from the one I have given. I must do the right thing by this woman. A pause. Gareth is about to speak... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) But, Gareth, I have made a pledge to myself that I will not allow the pour to fuck up.
2) 144) dialog: I made my decision. The call is cut. Ivan drives on as he considers the question. Has he lost his mind? We come close to his face as he considers his situation. Then he glances in the rear view mirror. We sense that something in the mirror bothers him, an irritant he tries ignore but finally can’t. He snaps into the rear view mirror... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) What the fuck are you looking at? A pause. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) You’re watching this aren’t you. Laughing at my predicament? A familiar predicament to a man like you, right dad? A pause. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) You think ‘there he is, look. Like father like son. The man I made’. A pause. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) What is it they say? The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. Well that’s where you’re wrong. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 16A. He studies the road, the lights flashing across his face. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 17. Ivan erupts slowly... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) You listen to me you fucking piece of worthless shit. I want you to watch... A pause. His face harder and harder... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) In fact I’d like to take a fucking shovel and dig you up out of the fucking ground and make you watch me tonight. He stares into the mirror. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) I'd pull open your eyes and kick the mud and worms and shit out your ears. Just for the duration of this fucking journey. Because it’s me driving not you. He drives on but his face fixes with determination.... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) And unlike you I‘’1ll go to the place where I should be and I’11 be there to take care of my fuck up. I’11 take what’s due to me. He glares into the rear view mirror... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) So you laugh or do what the fuck you want, like you always do, but I’ll fix this. Pause. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) I’ll fix it. His phone rings. He glances at the ghost of his father wi venom. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Yes Donal.
2) 148) dialog: Ok, ok stop. When you get back on site you check every pump yourself, individually and with your own hand on the turner. You don’t ask anybody else to check and sign off. You go around the whole site and you check each one yourself. And don’t trust Alby after five because he drinks. Now. Talk to me about the mix.
2) 150) dialog: Don’t say that like it’s a question. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 18.
2) 152) dialog: All the mixes for this pump will be C6. Why do you even ask? It’s written on the whiteboard in fucking giant letters. I put ‘C6’ all over the cabin in big red letters. Slump of one inch, Cé. Don’t ask me questions like that...
2) 154) dialog: What time are you unlocking?
2) 156) dialog: Good. Except, don’t sleep. Check everything. You’ve got the client sign-off.
2) 158) dialog: That’s what I mean. The gate sign off. Donal, the construction sign off should already be filed.
2) 160) dialog: Ok, you have the phone numbers of the plants. Call them now Donal. Call every one of the bastards and get them to repeat the order. C6 on the nose or we send the trucks back. Seriously. Those bastards will fuck you up with water in the gulleys if it rains tomorrow.
2) 163) dialog: You don’t trust God when it comes to concrete. Call the plants, Donal. Every one of them and get them to fax the order back so you can check it.
2) 165) dialog: Yes. He’s calling Chicago. I’m guessing Chicago is going to fire me and he’1l put some fucking kid on it. So don’t take his calls. Don’t listen to anybody else. Until the morning this is me and you, ok? Ivan cuts the call. He drives. He stares into the rear vi (From now, his looks into the rear view are looks into th past, looks at his father, proving he is going to do the right thing.) After forty seconds he again brings up his speed dial numbers. He shuffles through to the word ‘HOME’. He steel himself. He hits the button and the phone begins to ring. At this moment, his car joins the motorway...
3) 0) text: From a high gantry we see Ivan’s car joining the stream o other cars heading South. He is just a man in a bubble of light, no different to all the other drivers on their own journeys....
4) 0) text: Ivan hears the call being taken. It is a boy, fourteen ye old (EDDIE)
4) 2) dialog: Eddie, it’s your dad. Is your mother there?
4) 5) dialog: I won’t be back for that.
4) 7) dialog: Something came up. Silence. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) I can’t get out of it...
4) 9) dialog: I won’t be back for the match. A long pause. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) I‘1l listen on the radio. A disbelieving silence...
4) 11) dialog: Is your brother there?
4) 13) dialog: No. Just tell your mother to call me when she gets back.
4) 15) dialog: I love you.
4) 17) dialog: It’s ok. Get her to call me. He cuts the call. He drives on. The motorway is busy with trucks, lit up in the darkness. He takes a moment then fi Bethan’s name on his speed dial. Ivan cuts Bethan. BETHAN’S ANSWER MESSAGE (OOV) Hello, this is Bethan, I’m afraid I can’t get to the phone... the call. He drives. Then the phone rings. It is
4) 19) dialog: Are you ok?
4) 21) dialog: Did you talk to anyone about pain?
4) 23) dialog: But is everything alright?
4) 25) dialog: I’m on the M6. Hour and a quarter if the traffic stays ok. Speak to someone about pain. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 22.
4) 27) dialog: We don’t know each other, Bethan. That’s the simple truth. This thing just happened...
4) 29) dialog: ++.SO we can’t love or hate each other. This thing happened and that’s it. It will go up and down. But I’m coming at least.
4) 31) dialog: I don’t know you so I don’t hate you. Do what they tell you to do. I have a lot of calls to make. The traffic is fine so it’ll be ok.
4) 33) dialog: Yes, but there’s a limit. He cuts the call and drives. He suddenly beats the steeri wheel with the side of his fist hard, a sudden explosion fury. Then he gets hold of himself. The phone rings. He sees the number... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Hello Gareth.
4) 35) dialog: It is. Ok.
4) 37) dialog: Nine years.... A pause. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 23.
4) 39) dialog: Outside nuclear and military...
4) 41) dialog: So. Ok.
4) 43) dialog: It’s ok. I will still make sure the pour is alright.
4) 45) dialog: I know, and I don’t blame them. But I’m not trying to keep my job. I just want the pour to go ok tomorrow...
4) 47) dialog: Listen to me. I want the pour to go ok not because of the money... He takes a moment... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) I want it to go right for myself and for the building. And for the concrete. I won’t let it be pumped into the wrong place. Tonight and tomorrow I will stay on this and stay on this and make sure the concrete gets poured right. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 24.
4) 49) dialog: Fuck ten years. The concrete will come and I will take care of it. I know I don’t have a job anymore but I will do this anyway as a favor to the building and to the concrete.
4) 51) dialog: I am the same. A pause.
4) 53) dialog: I’m not sick. And I will make sure the pour is ok.
5) 0) text: From surveillance cameras we see Ivan’s car driving in th fast lane. We hear his phone ringing and hear him answer.
5) 2) dialog: Hello Katrina...
6) 0) text: Ivan stares ahead as he drives fast.
6) 2) dialog: Did Eddie not give you the message.
6) 4) dialog: I’m not coming home.
6) 7) dialog: Which phone are you on?
6) 9) dialog: I can hear the TV. Could you take this call on the phone upstairs.
6) 11) dialog: I have something... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) I have something to say.
6) 13) dialog: I won’t be home. We hear the boys and the TV in the background.
6) 15) dialog: Will you go to the phone in the bedroom? Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 26.
6) 17) dialog: Go to the phone in the bedroom and I’1l tell you what’s happened. The line crackles and we hear Katrina call out...
6) 20) dialog: Eddie, I’m talking to your mother...
6) 23) dialog: Eddie, will you put the phone down please?
6) 25) dialog: Please put the phone down. Eddie puts the phone down. A pause...
6) 27) dialog: Last year. The job in Croydon. I was up and down there for three months, remember? A pause. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) I stayed in that guest house. The one I said had bad damp. A pause. A pause. A pause. Silence... Silence. Silence. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 27. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) They gave me an assistant. She worked with me on the block construction.
6) 29) dialog: She was a secretary. Quite old. We worked together...
6) 31) dialog: She is quite old and lives on her own. Forty three or something.
6) 33) dialog: This is the only time I ever did this, Katrina. The only time. After the block was settled in, there were some drinks to celebrate. The block going in is a big thing because it is the base of the whole building... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) And she came back to the guest house. She isn’t what you would call an oil painting. But it was wet and cold. She talked about being lonely and I talked about being happy but lonely sometimes when I was away. And there was this wine. And this was the only time I did this in all our fifteen years. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) And now, tonight, she is giving birth. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 28. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Tonight she is giving birth. And it’s mine. The call is cut. Ivan drives on. We stay with Ivan for a minutes as he drives. He is not a man accustomed to momen like this and his reaction is just the blue glistening ti an iceberg. He looks like a man made of ice in the headlights. The phone rings. Ivan forces himself to answer because he knows he must. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Donal.
6) 38) dialog: Donal, what does it say on the whiteboard?
6) 40) dialog: What does it say on every piece of paperwork and every sign off sheet?
6) 42) dialog: It says C6. And you know why? A pause. A pause... Silence. A pause. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 29. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Because, eventually, when my building is complete, it will be fifty five floors high. It will weigh two million two hundred and twenty three thousand metric tons. My building will alter the water table and squeeze granite. Now... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) ...If the concrete at the base of my building is not right, if it slips a half inch, cracks appear. If cracks appear they will grow and grow and the whole thing will collapse.
6) 44) dialog: You make one mistake, Donal. One, little fucking mistake, and the world comes down around you. So... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Tell Stafford... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Ccé.
6) 46) dialog: Katrina...
6) 48) dialog: Katrina, I want to move to a practical next step...
6) 50) dialog: I can’t talk very well. I have felt scraped out for months. She phoned and said she was having a baby and keeping it because it was her last chance to be happy. And then tonight she phoned and said the waters broke and it’s two months early. I was going to tell you before but the waters broke early. So I have to do this now in the car. Every night I was going to tell you...
6) 52) dialog: Katrina, you know what happened with my dad and how the bastard wasn’t around for me and didn’t even give me a name...
6) 54) dialog: Katrina, I will give the baby my name and it will see my face and it will know and it won't spend it’s life thinking and thinking...
6) 56) dialog: I should have said all this a long time ago. I have behaved not like myself.
6) 58) dialog: Katrina, don’t go.
6) 60) dialog: I could have said nothing. I could have said nothing. Or I could have lied. I could have run. I was offered a thing in Toronto. A two year tower. He suddenly remembers who he is speaking to. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Why am I telling you of all fucking people. I can see that shit-eating grin on your great fat face, wipe it off... Ivan stares at the road ahead.
6) 61) dialog: I’m not you. Pop the fucking corks. I’m not you. I'll fix this. He drives. He gets a call and sees ‘Home’ and answers fast... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Kat, listen....
6) 63) dialog: Is your mother there? We hear him call...
6) 66) dialog: No. We hear a muffled voice.
6) 68) dialog: Eddie? Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013
6) 70) dialog: It's ok. I/’11 talk to you when it all settles down. 31A. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 32. He cuts the call. He drives for forty seconds. We study h The phone rings. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Ivan Locke.
6) 72) dialog: Is everything ok?
6) 74) dialog: I am the father.

6) 78) dialog: What is the complication?
6) 80) dialog: Yes. I’m driving. I’m doing ninety.
6) 82) dialog: I will be there. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 33.
6) 84) dialog: Yes. I will be there.
6) 86) dialog: Bailey. Ok.
6) 88) dialog: She isn’t used to being emotional I think. I think she is normally a very quiet person. A puzzled pause...
6) 90) dialog: I am the father. I don’t... A pause... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) .-+-I don’t know her too well if you want the truth. But I’m coming. A pause. The sister is used to oddness, the strangeness o relationships and continues...
6) 92) dialog: I understand. I’m driving. The call is cut. Ivan drives on and thirty seconds pass. The rear view is never far from his thoughts. The phone rings and he sees the name and manages to keep his voice under control... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Yes Donal.
6) 94) dialog: Good. You're testing with C6.
6) 96) dialog: And you called all the plants?
6) 98) dialog: They have the trucks lined up and the mix is in?
6) 100) dialog: What about retardant?
6) 102) dialog: Good. Now, do you have a pen?
6) 104) dialog: Get a pen. We almost hear Donal rolling his eyes. A pause. A drawer.
6) 106) dialog: In the top right hand drawer above the blow heater you’1l find my folder. Get it. It’s going to be your Bible tonight. We hear movement, drawers opening.
6) 108) dialog: Yes, it’s there, it’s there. It’s got everything you’re going to need in there. All the numbers, the sign offs, the road closures that you have to confirm with the police. The drawer above the blow heater.
6) 110) dialog: Donal, you know which drawer I mean. We hear movement and checking. Ivan drives...
6) 112) dialog: Fuck.
6) 114) dialog: Fuck.
6) 116) dialog: I have it here. A pause. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) All the things you’re going to need and I have it fucking here in my car. A long silence.
6) 118) dialog: Ok Donal, give me some time to think. Stay near to your phone. Ivan cuts the call and drives. He glances at the folder o the passenger seat. IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Fuck. The phone rings. We see ‘Home’. Ivan takes the call immediately... IVAN LOCKE (CONT’D) Are you ok?
6) 120) dialog: Kat please, just hear what I want to say... She suddenly screams at the top of her voice...
6) 122) dialog: Katrina, don’t let the boys hear you...
6) 124) dialog: Quietly.
6) 126) dialog: The block was in. I was happy with it.
