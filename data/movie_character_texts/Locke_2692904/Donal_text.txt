2) 38) dialog: Ivan, I hate myself even hearing myself even saying this, but if someone’s died like your mother or someone, could you not go wherever you have to go after twelve tomorrow when the concrete is pumped? Ivan drives...
2) 39) dialog: You know what I’m saying. Whoever is dead is not...you know...they won't be any different between now and midday. Dead people stay the same.

6) 35) dialog: But I just got off the phone with the plant in Stafford and they said they know it’s a C6 mix, but how far toward C5 can it go. Silence. Ivan is expressionless...
6) 36) dialog: In other words, if one truck has some C5, how badly would that be taken? Ivan lets the silence express his disbelief...
6) 37) dialog: Ivan, are you still there?
6) 39) dialog: It says C6.
6) 41) dialog: It says C6.

6) 113) dialog: Are you ok?
6) 115) dialog: What? A pause. Ivan has dropped the file on the passenger seat.
6) 117) dialog: You know Ivan in all the ten years I’ve worked with you, I’ve never known you to fuck up. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 36. A pause.

6) 159) dialog: Ok.
6) 161) dialog: Bottle of fizzy pop. Ivan reacts inside.
6) 163) dialog: Yeah. Ivan finds solace in the formality of details. He pronounces...
6) 165) dialog: Shoot. Ivan begins to recite from memory, staring ahead. He does even need the file to remember...
8) 2) dialog: Got it. A pause...
8) 4) dialog: It is. It is.
8) 6) dialog: Now Ivan, there’s no need for you to talk to me like that. A pause.
8) 7) dialog: I’ve got six calls stacked up on this phone from Gareth and I’m guessing what they are. (MORE)
8) 9) dialog: But I agreed I’m not taking those calls from Gareth because I’m fucking shitting my pants here about tomorrow going pear and I don’t want him to give me some fucking college kid construction director on the phone trying to talk me through this from scratch. So, as far as I’m concerned, until the sun comes up, yours is the only voice I will listen to. But hear this... A pause, a gulp.
8) 10) dialog: Don’t go off threatening me, ok? You have no official position to threaten me from. Ivan's expression doesn’t change but he has assessed Dona words and realized...
8) 12) dialog: One tin. So what? Ivan reacts inside. He drives on. This is another hole in the road but he adjusts quickly.
8) 14) dialog: I’m not hungry. Now let me make my call to the coppers and confirm these road closures. Then I’‘1l call you back for further instruction. Over and out... Donal cuts the call. Ivan holds it for a few seconds then roars with anger. He hurls the file back onto the seat beside him. He gets hold of himself. He drives on. Thirty seconds pass. The phone rings and he reads the name.
8) 70) dialog: Ivan, we have a problem with the stop and go...
8) 72) dialog: The shuttering boys have all gone home.
8) 74) dialog: Jesus...
8) 76) dialog: If this is just to stop me drinking, you can fuck off.
10) 57) dialog: I just did something on my own initiative.
10) 59) dialog: I found a mobile phone number for the council guy who signs off the closures. Ivan is slowly astonished...
10) 61) dialog: That’s him.
10) 63) dialog: I knew you’d need it. I have his mobile number. You took it over Christmas in case. I found it ina drawer. Even through all his distress, Ivan is overwhelmed, astounded.

10) 67) dialog: 
10) 71) dialog: No. 957. Are you writing it down?
10) 74) dialog: Are you writing it down?
12) 9) dialog: Ivan, it’s all gone to hell. Donal isn’t drunk but he’s been drinking.
12) 11) dialog: The re-bars in the shuttering in pit six. They wouldn’t hold a kittens fart. The fucking mavericks from up north we put in at the last minute.
12) 13) dialog: Nothing at all. Came away with a push.
12) 15) dialog: The shutterers all went home ages ago and they’re not in until six.
12) 17) dialog: He’s not answering. Nobody is answering. There’s some fucking football game on.
12) 19) dialog: They're in Germany digging out missile silos. Ivan takes all this on board. This is trouble but it’s trouble he knows. Locke - Shooting Script - Feb 21st 2013 59.
12) 21) dialog: A road gang?
12) 23) dialog: So do I have to drive down there? Can I not just ring him? Ivan reacts, reading between the lines...
12) 25) dialog: Ivan, I’ll be straight with you. I’m not drunk but I’ve had too much to get behind a wheel. If I get stopped again I go inside. Ivan drives, thinks, checks his watch.
12) 27) dialog: Run?
12) 31) dialog: What do you mean run? I don’t fucking run.
12) 33) dialog: I haven’t run since I was eight.
12) 35) dialog: Run? Are you mad? After a moment Ivan laughs too...
12) 37) dialog: I’ll get out of my boots and put on my trainers shall I...
12) 39) dialog: What? I run for bastards in Chicago who don’t care if I live or die.
