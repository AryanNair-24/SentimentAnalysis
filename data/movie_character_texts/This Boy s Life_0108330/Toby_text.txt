2) 0) text: Two people are in the straining car -- a woman and her son. The woman is CAROLINE WOLFF. Somewhere in her 30s, she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works at it. (Just now, though, her prettiness is marred by a fading bruise on her right cheekbone.) She is bright and energetic and lively. Even more important than these qualities, though, is her humor. And most important of all is a sensual quality she exudes. Her sensuality is effortless -- as natural to her as the color of her eyes and hair. Men turn on the street to stare at her. The boy is TOBY WOLFF. A    pleasant-faced boy with won- derful eyes, he is 13 --   teetering on the brink of adolescence, so that one   moment he seems like a self- assured teenager, and the   very next like a ten-year-old kid. Just now the ten-year-old kid has the upper hand: bored and weary with the long trip, Toby has been arguing with Caroline, who is ignoring him.
2) 1) dialog: ... Well,  I mean it. I'm serious -- I do.   You promise and promise, and then  you change your mind, just like  that.
2) 4) dialog: You wait 'til you ask me for something. Just wait. See if you get it.
2) 9) text: Toby, hush. Let me just... So concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish her sentence, she nurses the car upward. Finally the car crests the hill and starts down. Caroline sighs with relief. She turns to Toby with a smile.
2) 11) dialog: I said -- for the twentieth time -- if a person promises somebody something, they can't just turn around and take it back.
2) 13) dialog: Why not?
2) 15) dialog: I bet if you'd promised Roy some moccasins he'd of got 'em.
2) 17) dialog: Yeah, but you did promise...
2) 19) dialog: Jack.   Call me Jack.
2) 24) dialog: Seriously. If a person can't get a stinking miserable pair of moccasins, at least he ought to be able to choose his own name... (loud)
2) 28) dialog: Oh, you're so stupid sometimes, I... The BAWLING of an AIRHORN interrupts him. Both of them look through the back window and see a huge tractor- trailer truck, out of control, bearing down on them. Caroline brakes and steers a hard right, SKIDDING the NASH safely onto the side of the road. The truck, its HORN BLASTING steadily, shimmies and slides past them, and then, hideously, fails to make the next curve: it smashes through the guard rails and into empty space, its HORN still BLARING. Caroline and Toby look at each other, then scramble out of the car.
3) 0) text: Other drivers have stopped to look: hundreds of feet below, the truck lies on its back among boulders. Caroline glances, then turns away. She pulls Toby away, one arm around his shoulder.
4) 7) dialog: I hope to hell this isn't some kind of omen. Caroline turns to Toby, her face worried. Then she sees the look in Toby's eyes -- he's ragging her. She grins and gives his shoulder a light, affectionate shove.
5) 0) text: Toby (feet up on the dashboard wearing a brand-new pair of Indian moccasins) and Caroline sing "Mood Indigo" together. Toby holds  a complicated-looking, black con- traption which looks something like an antique flashlight
5) 1) dialog: How's this thing work, anyway?
5) 4) dialog: And we just walk along the street and find this glowing uranium?
5) 6) dialog: But we were too late in Moab, and that guy at the office said nobody'd found any uranium in Salt Lake City.
6) 0) text: We hear "MOOD INDIGO" on the car RADIO and see that a weary Caroline has driven through the night and Toby is slumped against the passenger door. Toby stirs, then opens his eyes.
6) 2) dialog: Forty-seven miles to go! Both of them are laughing with excitement. Toby claps his hands together once, very hard, and Caroline yells --
7) 0) text: Well, hell. The Nash Ambassador sits by the side of the road, its hood up, its radiator steaming. Caroline and Toby sit in a patch of shade by the car.
7) 3) dialog: It almost makes me want to see Roy -- he was the only one could make the thing stop overheating. (a beat)
8) 0) text: Toby waits beside the Nash Ambassador, looking toward a three-story concrete building. He holds a portable RADIO, which PLAYS DEAN MARTIN singing "Volare."

12) 1) dialog: That mechanic in Colorado said it needed points.
12) 7) dialog: You're gonna give our car away?
13) 0) text: 1957 is all around us: gas is 29.9 cents a gallon; bread is 19 cents a loaf; cars are curved and heavily chromed; people occasionally nod and smile at strangers; children carry hula hoops. In all, a gentler time. Caroline and Toby stride along briskly, as if they knew where they were going.
13) 5) dialog: Yeah, and like Dad used to say, 'We may be broke, but we're never poor.' And later, if we get a house with a big yard, I could get a collie, you know? One like Lad or Grey Dawn. And someday maybe a palomino. And I'm going to try harder in school, too... The two of them walk on -- a bit foolish, but, in an odd way, brave as hell.
14) 0) text: A subdued Toby sits in front of the VICE PRINCIPAL.
14) 3) dialog: She works.   She's working. Silent, the man continues to hold out the telephone to Toby. Finally he takes it and dials.
15) 0) text: Caroline and Toby exit.   Toby sullen; Caroline angry.
15) 1) dialog: It wasn't me broke their stupid windows.
15) 3) dialog: Gee, thanks a lot, Mom -- believe them instead of me.
15) 8) dialog: Yeah, well if you'd stayed married to Dad none of this would've ever happened.
16) 0) text: The place is pretty bleak: a room and a half, Murphy beds, linoleum floors, and a bath down the hall. Caroline and Toby enter. She pulls down the Murphy bed and falls onto it fully dressed, saying:
16) 4) dialog: Seven.    Almost.
16) 6) dialog: I started dinner. The potatoes are frying, and I'm heating up the hot dogs. Caroline sees that he's trying to make it up to her, and pats the bed for him to sit down next to her. He moves to sit beside her.
16) 11) dialog: I'm sorry.
16) 18) dialog: Who was that? She closes her eyes.
16) 19) dialog: Who was that? Caroline laughs aloud, then slides down the wall until she's on the floor still laughing.
17) 0) text: Caroline, Toby and ROY are eating at the tiny table. Roy is good-looking in a meaty, hairy-chested sort of way. Though he is on his very best behavior just now, there is a mean streak in him. Toby, delighted, holds a Winchester .22 rifle across his lap -- a peace-making gift from Roy.
17) 10) dialog: It's the best present I ever got. I just love it. (to Caroline)
17) 13) dialog: It's not loaded!
17) 15) dialog: It's got no bullets, for God's sake.
17) 20) dialog: I'll point it at the sky, then. Caroline sighs. Toby opens a screenless window and points the gun up into the night sky, pretending to fire it over and over. Caroline starts to clear the table. Roy jumps up to help her.
19) 0) text: Dressed for bed, Toby stands by an open window. He can hear every WORD of ROY'S, who continues to apologize between kisses. The room is illuminated by a nearby streetlamp. The frosty air from the open window causes his breath to steam. He raises two fingers to his lips, pretends to take a drag on a cigarette and blows out the steam from his breath. The VOICES in the other room grow a bit LOUDER, almost to an argument, and then SUBSIDE again. Toby takes another drag from his pretend cig- arette. He looks very young.
20) 0) text: Toby wanders toward the rooming house. He stops to watch TWO fiftyish WOMEN who are working in a garden. One Woman looks up.
20) 2) dialog: Hello. The Woman stops to take a breather, lights a cigarette, pokes her companion.
20) 6) dialog: Over there. (a beat)
20) 9) dialog: Yeah. I'm gonna live on his ranch in Phoenix. The "Lazy B," it's called.
20) 14) dialog: It is. I've got a palomino horse and a collie, and Dad lets us go on hunts all by ourselves. He gave me this Winchester .22, and last year I shot a mountain lion with it. And Lad -- that's my dog -- found a nest of rattlesnakes one time, and killed all twelve of them... The two Women exchange a glance.     It's obvious the boy is lying.
21) 0) text: Toby enters.   Four packed suitcases lie on the bed behin Caroline.
21) 1) dialog: What're you doing home so -- (as he sees suitcases)
21) 4) dialog: Where?
21) 6) dialog: Phoenix.
21) 8) dialog: What about your fabulous boyfriends? What about the fabulous, boring Roy? Is he coming, too?
21) 13) dialog: Roy's so uncool. So boring.
21) 16) dialog: Oh, shut up. But he's smiling, completely unbothered. Suddenly Caroline laughs, stands up, and begins to close the suitcases. Toby laughs, too.
21) 17) dialog: Now? We're going now?     What about all the food?
21) 19) dialog: Even the canned stuff?
22) 0) text: Caroline and Toby stand at a ticket counter, disappointed.
22) 1) dialog: Well, ask him when the next one to Phoenix is.
23) 0) text: Toby and Caroline hurry onboard a Greyhound bus with Seattle as its destination.
23) 2) dialog: If there's a big yard, can I get a collie?
23) 4) dialog: (as they board bus)
23) 5) text: Yeah -- like heaven on a June day. The DOORS of the bus close. WHOOSH! The bus begins to move. Caroline and Toby's faces are at the window: Seattle or bust.
24) 5) dialog: Yeah, yeah... Toby exits the house. But, Jesus, what a new Toby: he's turned cool. A few months have passed.  He now wears T-shirts and jeans which ride way low on his hips. As he walks along, he combs his hair into a duck's ass in back, and forward into a curl at the center of his forehead. He's 1957 hip -- or thinks he is.  He strolls on, feeling cool.
25) 0) text: From one of the houses TERRY TAYLOR emerges, falling into step with Toby. He's Toby's age, and is almost an exact replica of him.

25) 5) text: You make out good? (as Toby nods again)
25) 7) dialog: I fucked her 'til her nose bled.
26) 0) text: TERRY SILVER opens the door to admit Toby and Terry Taylor. Silver is a clone of both Toby and Terry Taylor.
28) 0) text: The boys light up three cigarettes (opening a window so the smoke will disappear), then throw themselves onto the floor in front of a black-and-white TV. Superman is ON. When Lois Lane comes on, Terry Taylor starts moaning as if sexually aroused; Terry Silver jumps to his knees and licks the TV screen repeatedly, also moaning. Toby closes his eyes, also as if in sexual transport.
28) 1) dialog: Oh, Lois. Oh, baby, come here -- I got six hot inches just waiting for you.
28) 5) dialog: Oh, babybabybabybabybaby... You make my dick hard! The three carry on for a few more seconds.
29) 10) dialog: Don't want who?
29) 16) dialog: He the one drives down from the boondocks? The mechanic? Dwight. What a stupid name. (he draws the name out)
29) 17) text: Dwiiiight. Duhhhhwight. Dwight-tah-h-h-h. Dwighttahhhhh. There is a KNOCK    on the front door. Toby sticks his he around the door,    looking into the living room. A man i outlined against    the sunset, only his black silhouette visible. It is     our first glimpse of DWIGHT. Has the man heard him?     Toby doesn't know for sure. Caroline brings Dwight into the kitchen.     He is older than her, an attractive-enough man. He     is well-built, has a full head of brown hair, and very    white teeth. Those are his good points. On the minus     side: his ove eagerness to please, his nervous smiles    and his clothe He wears two-tone shoes, a hand-painted    tie, and a monogrammed handkerchief, folded beyond    perfection, in the pocket. Caroline introduces him to Marian and Kathy.     Then she introduces Dwight to Toby. Dwight is all smiles.
29) 24) dialog: No.
29) 26) dialog: No.
29) 29) text: I always say people can call me anything they want, long as they don't call me late for supper! Kathy and Marian think it's pretty funny.     They laugh. Caroline smiles. Toby just stares.
29) 31) dialog: No.
29) 33) dialog: Oh, have another cookie, Marian -- keep your strength up.
29) 48) dialog: Really? I can shoot my Winchester? Great! I bet I could be the one to get the turkey.
30) 0) text: We hear SCREAMING. Toby and Terry Taylor race BY the CAMERA on stolen tricycles, yelling as if they're attack- ing Indians. Behind them comes Terry Silver, on foot. Atop a small hill, both boys jump off, letting the TRICYCLES SMASH into a parked car. Then they run like hell with Terry Silver bringing up the rear.
31) 0) text: Caroline is dressed casually. Toby has on a shirt and sweater. He is pretending that he's buck-toothed. Caroline finishes packing a small suitcase.

35) 0) text: Dwight's Buick pulls to a stop; Dwight, Caroline, and Toby get out. The scenery is as beautiful as Dwight said it was.
37) 0) text: The business area is small and rather forlorn. The six of them walk in pairs -- Dwight and Caroline, Skipper and Norma, and last, Toby and Pearl. (Toby's eyes are glued to the movement of Norma's body.)
38) 0) text: Dwight has recovered his good mood. Dressed in a marksman's coat with a padded shoulder, Dwight is laughin as he attempts to assemble Toby's Winchester .22.
38) 5) dialog: There's no real turkey?
38) 8) dialog: But you said I could!
39) 0) text: A sullen Toby stands with Pearl. Dwight is giving his name and the entry fee to a MAN. As the Man moves away, Caroline stops him and holds out some money.
40) 7) text: Then you won't feel too bad about carrying it home, will you? Several people laugh, and the Man, bested, turns away. Everyone turns quiet to watch the Man shoot. He is evidently the one who's nervous, though, for after he SHOOTS and waits, the score is raised: 95. There is an immediate stir -- Caroline can win if she shoots a virtually perfect round. Dwight's name is called. He takes his position, but clowns around, SHOOTING first left-handed, then right- handed, then with both eyes closed. His score is raised: 24. There is scattered laughter, and Dwight leads it -- hell, it's all a joke to him, his attitude says. Caroline takes her stance. Rock-steady, she SHOOTS her TEN SHOTS and waits. And then it comes: 98. She's won. The second-place Man wheels away angrily, but everyone else congratulates the laughing Caroline, as an official presents her with a small trophy of a gold rifle on a pedestal, and a huge ham. In the midst of the hubbub, Toby manages to get close enough to congratulate his mother. Caroline glances toward Dwight as she whispers to Toby:

43) 6) dialog: They're okay. What's that bald spot on Pearl's head? Ugh.
43) 8) dialog: Norma's nice.
43) 10) dialog: That's fine with me. (a beat; new tone)
43) 13) dialog: That woman he married?    Is she really rich?
44) 0) text: Toby, Terry Silver and Terry Taylor lounge against the wall, smoking.
44) 1) dialog: I mean I blew it off, man -- I blew his fuckin' turkey's head off. Terry Silver takes a long slow drag on his cigarette. The other boys glance at each other: they don't buy it.
44) 3) dialog: Fuckin' A.    Winchester .22.   Pump.
44) 5) dialog: Don't believe me -- see if I care.
44) 7) dialog: One bullet, maybe.
45) 0) text: Toby stands at the top of a small hill with Terry Silver and Terry Taylor. They are too casual, their faces too innocent: something's up. They wait until a middle-aged man raking leaves turns and disappears around a corner. Then the three of them open the door of a car, take off the emergency brake, and start it rolling down the hill.
46) 0) text: Caroline, Toby, Marian and Kathy sit at the table eating dinner.
46) 2) dialog: Oh! Toby grabs Caroline's lighter, and begins to imitate Dwight: saying, "Oh!" and "Oh, yes!" and Oh, my!" and "Here, let me!" and "I'll do that!" It's a mean, accurate imitation of Dwight. All three women laugh in spite of themselves. Caroline keeps saying "Jack, that's enough," and Marian says, "Dwight's not that bad." But they can't help laughing. Toby offers the other two women a light, then offers a broom, the back door, and the refrigerator a light.
47) 0) text: The principal, MR. SHIPPY, sits behind his desk. Toby, looking scared, sits across from him. A secretary lets Caroline into the room. Mr. Shippy rises and introduces himself. Caroline doesn't respond to the introduction.

51) 1) dialog: Hey, look:   is that a raccoon or a beaver. Dwight swerves deliberately to hit the animal. There is a sickening THUMP, and Dwight stops. As he backs up:
51) 3) dialog: That thing's probably got rabies...
52) 0) text: Toby moves to where the dead beaver lies on its back, its eyes open, in the red glow of the taillights. Toby picks the thing up and lugs it back toward Dwight, who has the trunk open.
53) 0) text: Dwight is still drinking, between swallows, he gives Toby sneering glances. Dwight is driving very fast. The road begins a series of curves. Dwight doesn't slow down, and the TIRES begin to SCREAM on the curves. The road runs along a steep gorge. Dwight increases the speed, and the car begins to fishtail.
53) 1) dialog: I'm a little sick to my stomach.

57) 15) dialog: Dear Mom, Thanks for the birthday present. It fit fine. You don't have to worry so much. I'm okay here. The weather is nice, and I like Scouts a lot. Dwight took us all to see Bridge on the River Kwai. I liked it. So things are all right with me, except for stupid Pearl, who I hate. Don't worry all the time... 55   E)   (NIGHT) Dwight introduces Toby at a Scout meeting. All the other boys have on Scout uniforms. 55   F)   (DAY) Toby is on the utility porch  husking the horse chestnuts. His hands are now  orange. Pearl stands in the doorway watching him work.

73) 20) dialog: Why don't you take a long walk off a short pier?
73) 22) text: Excuse me, but has anyone ever told you your breath would gag a maggot? Both of Toby's friends laugh.
73) 23) dialog: Well, at least I'm not a great big sissy! Two things happen instantly: the superior smile vanishes from Arthur's face, and Toby's friends exchange a single expectant look: "Here it comes."
73) 37) dialog: Okay.
73) 39) dialog: Okay.   I take it back.
73) 41) dialog: You're not a sissy. Arthur immediately turns and walks away, but Toby ignores them and walks away in the opposite direction, delivering his hated newspapers.

74) 2) dialog: Who asked you?
74) 9) dialog: Oh, the bride is calm.   Who the hell cares? Caroline refuses to argue. She picks up a piece of material and holds it up to the window to see if her choice of color was a good one.

Behind him, on the wall, Toby has pinned the covers of fifteen copies of the Scout magazine: so that, above Toby's head are the words BOY'S LIFE fifteen times. There is a MURMUR of VOICES, and FOOTSTEPS COMING toward Toby. Toby expects the worst. But, surprisingly, Dwight is beaming.
75) 2) dialog: (surprised)
75) 5) dialog: Well, it wasn't black yet.
75) 12) dialog: I called him a sissy. Dwight hoots with laughter and slaps his leg.

79) 7) dialog: I'm afraid I'll hurt you.
79) 9) dialog: But I might. Finally Toby gives a half-hearted "Hah!" and swings the side of his forearm toward Dwight's throat. Dwight catches the arm easily.
79) 13) dialog: You just about got dry-gulched, my man. Dwight manages a grin, but he is not happy to have been bested.

84) 6) dialog: That's not fair. I ought to be able to have my own money. (as Caroline shrugs)
84) 12) dialog: Well, at least ask him about my gym shoes again. I can practice barefoot but for games I gotta have shoes.

84) 16) dialog: Oh, I hate it here! I wish we could just get up and go.

85) 1) text: "The Lawrence Welk Show" is ON the TELEVISION. Dwight, Caroline, Skipper, Norma and Pearl and Toby watch an Irish tenor sing a lugubrious ballad. Dwight stands in a corner of the room, his saxophone to his lips. He's playing along with the MUSIC, but silently. Occasionally he gets overcome and accidentally causes the saxophone to squawk. The Irish ballad ends, and Lawrence Welk's Champagne Orchestra strikes up a lively polka. Dwight takes a sip of his drink and grabs Caroline, pulls her to her feet, and begins to dance with her. A polka can be a decorous, contained dance. He dances Caroline vigorously around the living room, out into the kitchen, around the table, and then back again. Dwight is really good, and Caroline matches him every step of the way. Skipper turns the  VOLUME UP and Dwight kicks the dance into an even higher, wilder gear: The kids clap on the beat, the two whirl and stamp and spin.
86) 0) text: Dwight and Toby face one another in the living room. Both wear their Scout uniforms. Dwight holds a box of chocolate-coated cherries in one hand.

86) 34) dialog: Then give me the money I earn!
86) 36) dialog: Mom,  won't you at least make him let  me have the shoes for gym? How  can I play basketball without gym  shoes? I'm the only one who -- Toby stops suddenly. He looks at Dwight for a beat or two, and then speaks in a different tone:
86) 37) dialog: It's not the shoes, is it? Or the candy. It's me, isn't it? You just can't stand the fact of me. Dwight glances at Caroline, who still looks at her sewing.
86) 54) text: You lay down and rest awhile. Dwight and Toby grab their caps and hotfoot it out the door.

88) 12) dialog: That's dumb. A little funny, though. How come your dad never comes to meetings with you?

89) 0) text: Toby and Arthur are eating ice cream cones and smoking cigarettes at the same time. They walk slowly, desultorily. Though still effeminate, Arthur has dropped much of the flounciness that he uses in public.
89) 8) dialog: (shrugs)
89) 12) dialog: Why'd you point at me that day?
89) 14) dialog: Oh, come on, Arthur.   That's a little dramatic.
89) 18) dialog: I don't exactly feel like an alien. I've got friends here.
89) 23) dialog: Yeah, and you'll wind up a recluse that everybody says likes to dress up in his mama's old clothes.

98) 0) text: Caroline walks to Toby, sits next to him on the stoop.
98) 7) dialog: Oh, Mom, can't we leave here? I hate it so much. You don't like it either -- all you do is stick your head in a sewing machine night and day. Let's just leave and start over someplace else.
98) 9) dialog: But if...
98) 11) dialog: If you say 'look for the good stuff,' I'm gonna get Dwight's 30/30 and shoot myself!

101) 0) text: Dwight and Toby are looking for something. They both shine flashlights around the dark attic, illuminating old magazines, dolls, etc. Dwight says, "I know I put 'em up here somewhere." Then Toby's flashlight lands on the unusual tub with the four blue stars which had held the beaver. Forgotten all this time, the beaver has transmogrified into a weird, two-foot high pile of what looks like cotton candy. And, hideously enough, the cloud-like stuff is still in the shape of the beaver. Then Dwight says, "Shit -- the roof must've leaked on 'em." Toby turns to where Dwight shines his flashlight on the ten boxes of chestnuts. Also forgotten, the chestnuts are    covered with mold, too -- but a different kind: this     is wet, slick-looki stuff that rises off the chestnuts    like dough in a breadpan. A spasm of rage crosses     Toby's face, and he turns and bangs out of the attic.

109) 15) text: Suddenly Dwight is across the floor and onto the bed. He straddles Toby and slaps him across the face with the left hand then the right, again and again. Toby holds a forearm protectively across his face. Dwight holds both Toby's hands with one of his and, slaps the boy's face again and again. Finally Toby manages to get his right hand loose.      He slams his forearm across Dwight's throat. Dwight rears back, choking and gagging. Toby throws off the covers and tries to run.

(Behind him, the wall is now completely papered with the front pages of the Scout magazine, so that we see the words BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE repeated one hundred and twenty times.) Then Toby takes a slick brochure from under his pillow -- it's a bro- chure of Princeton. Photographs of beautifully tended lawns, and students on their way to class. Toby stares at the photographs, smoothing the pages carefully, long- ing in his face.

Exasperated that conversation is continuing when he's trying to listen, Dwight reaches over, presses his hand down on the arm of the record player, then SCRAPES it back and forth on the record.

143) 23) text: Now. Now, Mr. Big-Time Prep- School fucker, is it empty? Toby struggles, but Dwight has the strength of anger: trying always to protect his throbbing finger, Toby pulls free and jumps up from the table. Dwight is too quick for Toby, though: he grabs an even bigger handful of hair and forces Toby's face down onto the mustard jar again and again. And again. Each time he asks if the jar is empty. Finally, Toby gives up.
143) 24) dialog: (muffled)
143) 27) text: All right -- clean it out. His face smeared with mustard, Toby's expression is murderous. He picks up a knife and scrapes at the mus- tard, trying to get up under the neck. He manages to get a few brown and yellow smudges on the knife, which he transfers to the edge of a plate. Dwight watches.
143) 32) dialog: Yes! Dwight slaps Toby across the mouth and the battle is on. As Pearl stands frozen, Toby lunges at Dwight, they grapple and stagger around the room. GLASS SHATTERS, the kitchen table CRASHES over, and their feet STAMP and SHUFFLE but Toby is a wild man. Even though he has only one good hand. He lands a blow between Dwight's eyes that bangs the man back against the wall. Dwight grabs the pan with the hot water from the hotdogs, flings it at Toby. Most of it misses. Again they grapple. Toby manages to throw Dwight down, then grabs a broom that has fallen to the floor, presses it against Dwight's throat, using his good hand and one knee. Dwight's mouth gapes wide, his eyes bulge, and he jerks himself frantically trying to dislodge Toby, but Toby hangs on like grim death. Desperate, Dwight grabs Toby's bandaged hand, bringing it close to his own face, and bites the stump of Toby's injured finger as hard as he can. Toby and Pearl scream simultaneously. Pearl in horror, Toby in pain. Pearl runs into her bedroom. Toby reels back in pain, holding his freshly-bleeding hand. Dwight takes his chance, grabs Toby by the throat, forces him down onto the floor and begins to choke the boy. Toby's eyelids begin to flutter. He's losing consciousness.
