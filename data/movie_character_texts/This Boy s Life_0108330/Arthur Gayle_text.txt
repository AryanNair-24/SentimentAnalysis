73) 0) text: Toby, his news bag slung over his shoulder, stands talking idly with two boys from school, OSCAR BOOKER and JIMMY VOORHEES. One of them says, "Uh-oh," and jerks his head to indicate where Toby and the other boy should look. They look in the direction indicated, and see Arthur Gayle coming down the road toward them, followed by a small black dog called Pepper. As the boys watch Arthur's approach:
73) 16) dialog: Oh, my, my -- look at all that yellow: Didn't your mama teach you to wash your hands after you pee?
73) 18) dialog: (rolls his eyes; heavily sarcastic)
73) 21) dialog: (though he's not nearly close enough to smell Toby's breath)
73) 27) dialog: 
73) 32) dialog: Take it back.
73) 36) dialog: Take it back. Arthur's words are not angry anymore.    Toby's worn out too...
73) 38) dialog: Say it.
73) 40) dialog: No, say 'You're not a sissy.' Toby glances at Oscar and Jimmy. Their faces are gleeful but he doesn't care what the hell they think.
75) 17) text: He dry-gulched you. Now that's your fault. You gotta keep your guard up. There's no excuse for getting dry-gulched. I'll show you a couple moves after supper that'll leave Miss Arthur Gayle wondering what month it is.
88) 0) text: As Toby kneels down to tie his shoelace, a small black dog runs up to him. Toby pets it. Arthur Gayle, his black eye healed, stands ten feet away.
88) 1) dialog: You like my dog?
88) 6) dialog: Smart, too -- he can talk.
88) 9) dialog: Hey, Pepper -- what's on a tree? As PEPPER BARKS TWICE:
88) 10) dialog: Bark! Way to go, Pepper -- pretty smart. Oh, I was wondering, Pepper -- I wanted to ask you something: how's the world treating you? As PEPPER BARKS ONCE:
88) 11) dialog: Rough!   Yeah, I know what you mean.
88) 13) dialog: I don't have a dad. Never did. I sprang full-blown from my mother's forehead. You want to walk home with me and Pepper?
89) 0) text: Toby and Arthur are eating ice cream cones and smoking cigarettes at the same time. They walk slowly, desultorily. Though still effeminate, Arthur has dropped much of the flounciness that he uses in public.
89) 1) dialog: ... Tobias? Your real name is Tobias? Toby... Tobias... I like it -- it's very elegant.
89) 6) dialog: My real parents would probably have given me an elegant name, too. I say 'real parents' because I suspect I'm a foundling. Somebody royal -- or at least very, very beautiful had me and gave me to my poor but honest mother. (a beat)
89) 10) dialog: (laughs)
89) 13) dialog: Because you're an alien. You don't belong in Concrete any more than I do. This place would like to kill us because we're different.
89) 15) dialog: Think so? You know what chickens do if one chicken's born with a little difference? With a few black feathers on its head, say? They peck at the black spot 'til the chicken's dead -- they can't stand the fact that it's different. Now we're both different. Your difference is something other than... (husky-voiced actress)
89) 22) dialog: Yes, and they're fools. And you act like a fool when you're around them. A prediction: if you stay in Concrete, you'll wind up working at the A&amp;P -- either that or you'll go on a rampage with a hunting rifle.
89) 24) dialog: (laughs)
99) 0) text: Arthur is playing the piano. He and Toby sing an old song called "I Wandered Today To the Hill, Maggie." Both of them are enjoying it. As they finish the song, Arthur says a dry "Will you be able to use your musical abilities at the A&amp;P?" Toby laughs and gives him a ha elbow in the ribs.
120) 0) text: Toby bangs onto the bus, throws himself into a seat beside Arthur. He hands a grade card to Toby.
120) 1) dialog: You didn't pick this up yesterday -- congratulations, you got nothing higher than a C.
120) 3) dialog: You're gonna get caught some day. (as Toby laughs a moronic laugh)
120) 9) dialog: No, but I'll show you how to work the problems.
120) 11) dialog: Oh, Jack.
120) 13) dialog: I take it back you don't act like Psycho, you act like Dwight.
120) 16) dialog: I know, but you've said that for two years.
120) 18) dialog: You mean the brother Gregory in Princeton who never calls you? That brother Gregory?
120) 20) dialog: And he asked you to live with him?
120) 25) dialog: What about your grades? And what would you use for money?
120) 27) dialog: If the dog hadn't stopped to pee, he'd have caught the rabbit. Suddenly Toby is angry.   He stands up, moves to another seat.
131) 0) text: Between classes, Toby and Arthur are at a row of lockers.
131) 1) dialog: I won't do it.
131) 3) dialog: I'm surprised you'd want help from anybody who fights for the pink team.
131) 5) dialog: No. Why should you get to be the one? Why not me?
132) 0) text: Toby is working with a table saw. Suddenly a two-inch- thick manilla envelope plops down beside him. He looks up to see Arthur standing beside him. Glancing around to see that he's unobserved, he checks the contents of the envelope: we see school stationery, blank transcript forms, and a stack of official envelopes. Toby closes his eyes. He's saved.
132) 5) dialog: No, I've grown progressively fond of Concrete. I think I'll stay here all alone and dress up in my mama's old clothes sometimes -- like you said. Arthur turns and    swishes away. Toby pats   the manilla envelope, turns    back to the saw. Suddenly   he jerks, looks down, and    sees that the ring finger  of his left hand is spurting    blood. Toby says a mild,   astonished "Hey," and sinks    to his knees.
