She carries the grocery bag into the kitchen. Out of the bag, she removes a Lean Cuisine, a giant bottle of cream soda and four giant bars of Chunky chocolate.  She pops the Lean Cuisine into the oven and walks back into the living room to an old stereo.  She turns the TURNTABLE on -- a record already set upon it. She stands by her coffee table, as if taking position: Suddenly, we hear ETHEL MERMAN -- as Lydia lip-syncs every word with complete commitment -- giving a full out performance.

56) 2) text: Her attempts at hand gestures and choreography are awkward -- bunking into the coffee table, banging her hand against a lamp -- but, we see a part of Lydia that few (actually no one) sees.  Her abandon, her joy... her smile.  From upstairs, neighbors BANG for her to keep the music down.  Lydia casually crosses to the stereo, turns off the turntable and heads back to the kitchen -- as if the neighbors interference were all apart of her nightly ritual.

68) 23) text: Lydia eyes Anne suspiciously, then turns to survey the shelves.  Parry picks up her card and laminates it -- all the while, keeping his eyes fixed upon Lydia's every move.  Anne and Jack, having set the trap, watch with interest. Lydia surveys the film boxes, H-L.  She spots one of interest and pulls it off the shelf -- causing two other boxes to fall down on her.  She catches one box and, as she replaces it back on the shelf, causes three more to fall.  She catches two of the three. Parry, Anne and Jack watching with an odd fascination.

80) 2) text: LYDIA is nervous about this. As everyone begins to eat, S eyes her chopsticks with reluctance. PARRY looks at her and smiles encouragingly. LYDIA forces a smile back, picks up her chopsticks and di PARRY watches her in adoration. JACK subtly tries to get to stop staring. But PARRY is glued to his vision. LYDIA, even more awkward now with her new nails, drops he dumpling into her lap.

80) 18) text: His gentle voice counterbalances the odd lyrics and makes it sound like a love song. Anne eyes Jack to stop him. Jack is about to make an attempt but can't seem to find the way, so he doesn't bother. Lydia doesn't know how to respond either.  At first she smiles politely, then she pretends to be too busy eating to listen -- but something about Parry's sincerity pulls her in.  His face glows as he floats the lyrics across the table to her.  Slowly, her "smacking" subsides, she lowers her fork, forgets her self-consciousness and listens to Parry -- slightly hypnotized; like a little girl watching a ballerina for the first time. Jack is fascinated by Parry's complete adoration of this mess of a woman.  He looks to Anne, who tries to continue her meal nonchalantly.  He notices her bra strap hanging out from her sweater. CAMERA CUTS BACK AND FORTH between the exposed strap and Jack, as Parry continues seranading O.S.  Anne realizes Jack is staring at her and immediately thinks something's wrong.  But Jack just smiles at her.  His hand reaches across the table, not to fix her sweater, but to take her hand.  Anne is in shock.  She slips her hand into his and smiles back, her eyes almost tearing. When Parry finishes, he smiles.
80) 20) text: Lydia nods.  From O.S., Parry's hand holds a napkin and gently dabs a stain of soy sauce on her sleeve.

(driving herself into a complex) ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
82) 14) dialog: And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this? (to Parry, as she quickens her pace) It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
82) 15) text: She walks quickly away.  Parry stops, confused to say the least, then runs after her.  Lydia is just about to enter the front door of her building when Parry stops her.

82) 33) dialog: (continuing; earnestly) You are real, aren't you?
82) 34) text: They kiss again.  Then Lydia quickly pulls away...
82) 35) dialog: (continuing) ... You can call...
82) 36) text: She runs into the building, afraid to linger and ruin the moment.  Parry stands transfixed, his eyes following her. Lydia pauses briefly to look back.  She is so excited. She smiles and turns toward the elevator... her skirt spinning with her.
84) 0) text: PARRY is standing frozen... We don't know whether he's looking ahead of him or in his mind's eye... He appears anxious and frightened as he steps back, away from Lydia's building... He senses someone is watching him. Parry smiles.  But suddenly it is as if everything has gone into SLOW MOTION.  His eyes focus on her skirt as it swirls around as she turns... His expression grows dark: O.S. we hear a horses HOOVES moving in slowly as CAMERA moves to CLOSEUP.  He slowly turns his head and looks down the block to the corner to see: The Red Knight.  He sits upon his horse as if waiting for Parry.  The street lamps cast a glow around his imposing figure.  The night air lifts his cape up around his massive shoulders. Parry, vulnerable, in love, whispers plainly:

117) 0) text: Lydia makes her way down the corridor, pushing her way through the swinging doors into Parry's ward.  She is stopped in her tracks by what she sees: Parry has gathered all the patients to the center of the room, and is teaching them to sing "Groovin'".  Jack is watching.  Although most are not getting it, all are having a good time.  When one of the patients turns to look at Lydia, Parry turns as well... His face lights up as he says:
117) 2) text: Lydia loses control and begins to cry through her smile. Parry approaches and wraps his arms around her.
