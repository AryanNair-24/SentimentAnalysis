31) 8) text: He tries to focus his eyes and looks around the room: there is an extremely organized "living area" -- a make- shift kitchen with hot plate, a nail in a wall with clothes on hangers... There is also a dumpster sitting beneath a garbage chute -- The dumpster has planets and stars painted on its side. Jack looks to the far wall and sees a handmade collage mural:  pictures cut out and pasted in a haphazard manner, all medieval in origin; grassy landscape with castles, knights and maidens on horses, crests and symbols of the Crusades, and various renditions of the Holy Grail... One maiden stands out from the rest -- a frail looking doe-like creature. On the adjacent wall, however, there are no pictures. Only frantic scribblings in red marker... Out of the scribblings we can see:  an evil looking face with a bear amateurishly drawn... a large red horse drawn as if it hurt to get out the image... the style is violent and erratic. Jack looks to the other wall and finds Parry's arsenal -- homemade "weapons" that also look medieval, like lances made from mop sticks, nets made of knotted rope, slingshots and a shield made from a garbage can cover with a rose painted on it.  Against each wall are piled, what seems to be hundreds of books.  Jack doesn't know what to make of all this.  He is frightened.

34) 17) text: Anne grabs his face with both hands and pulls him into a kiss.  She proceeds to climb onto his body as she utilizes a skill she picked up in high school make-out parties.

He begins to sort through them... reading titles, remembering moments... then stops when he comes upon newspaper clippings of the murder at Babbitt's.  Edwin Malnick's face stares at him from a yellowed front page. The memories sour.  He moves to the bar.  Anne exits the bedroom.

Page after page has been ripped out anywhere there might have been a picture or a diagram.  He comes upon a large scroll that he unravels.  It is a map, drawn by Parry, of Langdon Carmichael's house and the surrounding blocks... He rolls it up... The Pinnochio doll sits on a broken chair facing the wall with the nightmarish scribblings... acting like a sentinel. He crosses to the prominent picture of the maiden with the long hair.  He notices a small stand before the picture, with a candle.  It is like a shrine with offerings:  a flower, a small perfume sampler, a box of Jawbreakers candy and a dime store romance novel.  Jack doesn't understand.

80) 18) text: His gentle voice counterbalances the odd lyrics and makes it sound like a love song. Anne eyes Jack to stop him. Jack is about to make an attempt but can't seem to find the way, so he doesn't bother. Lydia doesn't know how to respond either.  At first she smiles politely, then she pretends to be too busy eating to listen -- but something about Parry's sincerity pulls her in.  His face glows as he floats the lyrics across the table to her.  Slowly, her "smacking" subsides, she lowers her fork, forgets her self-consciousness and listens to Parry -- slightly hypnotized; like a little girl watching a ballerina for the first time. Jack is fascinated by Parry's complete adoration of this mess of a woman.  He looks to Anne, who tries to continue her meal nonchalantly.  He notices her bra strap hanging out from her sweater. CAMERA CUTS BACK AND FORTH between the exposed strap and Jack, as Parry continues seranading O.S.  Anne realizes Jack is staring at her and immediately thinks something's wrong.  But Jack just smiles at her.  His hand reaches across the table, not to fix her sweater, but to take her hand.  Anne is in shock.  She slips her hand into his and smiles back, her eyes almost tearing. When Parry finishes, he smiles.

The SOUND, at first, is starting.  An O.S. VOICE says:

When he finishes the entire pane, he replaces the cutter in his pocket then plasters his arm against the tape.  He gently bangs the pane and it comes loose, sticking to the tape.  He is impressed.  He places the pane on the roof and, fastening one end of the rope to a pipe, lowers the other end down.

Slowly, a shadow holding a shotgun emerges up the stairs against the back wall... Jack is paralyzed.  He closes his eyes.  The shadow reaches the top of the landing.  It is EDWIN MALNICK... Wearing the same expression we saw on the TV broadcast -- sad and harmless.  Jack's heart is bursting out of his chest.  Edwin calmly raises the gun, cocks it and FIRES:  the shot BLASTS down the hallway, deafening Jack.  But when he opens his eyes to see if he has been hit, there is no blood, no wound... and when he looks up, no Edwin.  He pulls himself together and continues:
