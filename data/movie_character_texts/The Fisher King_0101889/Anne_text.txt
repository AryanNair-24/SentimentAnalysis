HE is about to make a call when he stopped by the REPORTER mentioning his name... ...Representatives of radio cult personality Jack Lucas expressed regret, however no formal comment has been made. None of Babbitt's regulars had ever seen Edwin Malnick before....but tonight, few will soon forget this lonely man - who reached out to a world he knew only through the radio - looking for friendship...and finding only pain...and tragedy... This is Marc Saffron...Channel Ten news.
22) 2) dialog: These people are insane today. They took insane pills...
22) 3) text: A bit about Anne as she searches for a video:  Anne is in her mid-to-late thirties... and she is all woman!  She has a raw, earthy, unmistakable sensuality.  Her red lipstick matches her red nail polish like a hat and glove set.  Inlaid on each nail is a rhinestone design of a little star.  Her angora sweaters are tight and clinging, giving her breasts a decided lift and perkiness.  Her backless pumps slap the ground.  A half-smoked cigarette hangs out of her mouth with great expertise -- a skill Anne obviously picked up in a high school bathroom.  Her voice is thick with a delicious Brooklyn twang. She is pure streetwise in attitude, philosophy and emotio She turns and speaks to the man behind the tabloid.
22) 4) dialog: (continuing) Hey!  Mr. Happiness!
22) 5) text: The man lowers the newspaper:  it is Jack Lucas: no longer the aggressive radio star but more -- a man who looks like he hasn't slept in months.  An intolerant, paranoid, self-pitying misanthrope.  The outrageous articles fascinate him.  Anne removes the paper and scotch bottle.
22) 6) dialog: (continuing) Are we going to work today or what?
22) 7) text: Jack stares back.  Anne waits for an answer.  Jack looks through the open office door and sees the store is packed with rush hour customers -- any one, a potential mass murderer.
22) 8) dialog: (continuing) Hello!!!
23) 6) text: JACK grins his teeth and stares like a madman while ANNE, aware of the affect this phrase has on him, throws a worr look from the cash register.  The FRUMPY SECRETARY laughs
23) 12) text: ANNE, who has heard this entire exchange, has to bite her lip to prevent herself from laughing...SHE pulls JACK awa
23) 13) dialog: ...I'm sorry. (almost laughing) I need to borrow him for a moment.
23) 14) text: As ANNE tugs at his sleeve, JACK eyes the WOMAN like a ma being lead away from his prey. INT. VIDEO POP OFFICE - DAY. ANNE stands before JACK who leans against her office door
23) 15) dialog: Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
23) 17) dialog: Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
24) 0) text: Anne and Jack sit around a formica kitchen table in silence after eating dinner.  Anne smokes a cigarette.  A portable TV sits on a stand before them --

24) 4) dialog: Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
24) 7) text: APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER... Anne just stares at Jack.
24) 8) dialog: You're a sick fuck... I don't know why you torture yourself. (she hits his head) Too many thoughts -- too crowded in there.  You should read a book.
24) 11) text: He gets up to get a drink from Anne's makeshift bar.
24) 12) dialog: (defensive) It happens to be a beautiful love story. (hurt) Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
24) 14) text: Anne is deeply hurt by this.  She gathers her dignity and exits into the bedroom, slamming the door behind her. Jack downs his drink as the sitcom returns to the TV O.S.
31) 8) text: He tries to focus his eyes and looks around the room: there is an extremely organized "living area" -- a make- shift kitchen with hot plate, a nail in a wall with clothes on hangers... There is also a dumpster sitting beneath a garbage chute -- The dumpster has planets and stars painted on its side. Jack looks to the far wall and sees a handmade collage mural:  pictures cut out and pasted in a haphazard manner, all medieval in origin; grassy landscape with castles, knights and maidens on horses, crests and symbols of the Crusades, and various renditions of the Holy Grail... One maiden stands out from the rest -- a frail looking doe-like creature. On the adjacent wall, however, there are no pictures. Only frantic scribblings in red marker... Out of the scribblings we can see:  an evil looking face with a bear amateurishly drawn... a large red horse drawn as if it hurt to get out the image... the style is violent and erratic. Jack looks to the other wall and finds Parry's arsenal -- homemade "weapons" that also look medieval, like lances made from mop sticks, nets made of knotted rope, slingshots and a shield made from a garbage can cover with a rose painted on it.  Against each wall are piled, what seems to be hundreds of books.  Jack doesn't know what to make of all this.  He is frightened.
32) 22) text: - - And fade in Anne's voice...
32) 23) dialog: ..Listen. I understand about open relationships. Please. I was a teenager in the sixties after all....I understand!

33) 2) text: Her intercom RINGS. Anne's tone immediately changes:
33) 3) dialog: (continuing) WHAT!....
33) 5) dialog: So send him back! (she flicks off the intercom and returns to Jack, softly) ... Ya need to pick up the phone and tell me that you're not dead... that you haven't been attacked or raped or who knows.  You disappear last night. I don't know what to think.  I was up all night.  Look at you!
33) 8) dialog: I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
33) 9) text: She and the Businessman exchange glances.  Jack is about to respond when Anne continues:
33) 10) dialog: (continuing) I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
33) 12) dialog: What!
33) 14) dialog: Oh my God... What did they do!  My God!!!
33) 15) text: She crosses to Jack and hugs him... The Businessman turns with a concerned look, having overheard.  Jack indicates to Anne that he feels awkward in front of the Businessman.  Anne confronts the Businessman with as little tact as possible.
33) 16) dialog: (continuing) Are you almost done?!
33) 18) dialog: Whatta looking for -- a story!? (makes a selection) Here... "Creamer Versus Creamer"... It won an award.

33) 22) dialog: You're all right... you sure...

33) 24) dialog: (continuing) ... So... where did you sleep last night?
33) 26) dialog: (puts up her hand) Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth.
33) 29) dialog: Okay. (satisfied, she struts to her desk) ... I love you...
33) 31) dialog: (continuing) ... You don't have to say it back... although it wouldn't kill you.  I'll cook tonight.
34) 0) text: Anne and Jack have just finished eating dinner.
34) 2) text: Anne takes a long drag then puts it out in her leftover food.  Jack is repelled by the habit.
34) 3) dialog: The Holy Grail?  Yeah... I know that. It was like -- Jesus' juice glass.
34) 5) dialog: (continuing) Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
34) 7) dialog: Oh sure... Gotta believe in God. (trying to be  intellectual) But I don't think God made man in his own image.  No.  'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... Booooorring!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out... (Anne moves to him and leans in for a kiss) ... Not that we have to get married.
34) 10) dialog: Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
34) 11) text: Jack moves to the bar to fix a drink.  Anne follows him and takes the drink out of his hand.  Jack knows what this means.
34) 13) text: Anne massages his shoulders.
34) 15) text: Anne nods but keeps massaging.  As long as he wasn't with a woman, she doesn't care.  Her massaging gets more intense -- moving up his head and contorting his face as he speaks.
34) 17) text: Anne grabs his face with both hands and pulls him into a kiss.  She proceeds to climb onto his body as she utilizes a skill she picked up in high school make-out parties.  She is a pro.  Jack, against all his better judgement and will -- despite the pimple cream -- is rendered helpless by this woman's passion... He returns the embrace and guides her to the floor.
35) 0) text: Jack sits in his underwear on the living room floor before an open closet with a cardboard box between his legs.  The box is filled with tapes of Jack's past radio shows.  He begins to sort through them... reading titles, remembering moments... then stops when he comes upon newspaper clippings of the murder at Babbitt's.  Edwin Malnick's face stares at him from a yellowed front page. The memories sour.  He moves to the bar.  Anne exits the bedroom.
35) 1) dialog: Whatsa matter, hon -- can't sleep?
35) 4) dialog: Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
35) 6) dialog: You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
35) 8) text: Anne crosses to Jack and gently touches him.  Jack turns and clutches her to him tightly.  Lowering his head to hers, he cries...
35) 9) dialog: I know.  I know, honey.
57) 0) text: Anne sits alone at her formica table, smoking a cigarette.  Two plates are set.  She waits for Jack.  She is hurt and pissed off.  TONY ORLANDO AND DAWN play on her stereo.

57) 3) dialog: Ya fuckin' bastard.  I don't need this... (emphasizing) ... I Do Not Need This!  A woman my age... I am a person.  This is kid stuff.  You come!  You go!  And all I do is cook like a jerk!  You're a waste of good cutlets... I don't need this... Find yourself another dope... ya fuckin' bastard...
62) 2) text: He waits.  Anne enters.  She is obviously very irritated with him.
62) 3) dialog: Can I have my desk please.
62) 5) dialog: Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
62) 7) dialog: You're calling Lydia in my office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You... (she punches his arm) ... stay out all night long...

62) 17) dialog: What?  The curse'll be lifted?  Will you please!
62) 19) dialog: Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
62) 21) dialog: (pause) What does that mean?
62) 23) dialog: Well, what the hell does that mean?
62) 25) text: Anne looks at him incredulously.  He sits down and breathes a sigh -- the absurdity of the idea hitting him as well.  Anne softens -- feeling like she has unfairly taken the wind out of his sail.
62) 26) dialog: Oh, you poor kid... You're a mess.
62) 27) text: Anne stands and buries Jack's face in her breast.  She decides to be positive.
62) 28) dialog: (continuing) ... Well, listen... stranger things have happened.
63) 0) text: Jack on the phone to Lydia.  This time Anne is right beside him.
63) 3) text: Her abrupt manner surprises Jack.  Jack uses his old, confident radio voice.
64) 19) text: Lydia hangs up.  Jack turns to Anne.
68) 0) text: C.U. on ANNE, who is slighted repulsed by PARRY. JACK PARRY; his hair slicked back, wearing a Video Spot T over his clothes.

68) 14) dialog: This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
68) 16) dialog: Yeah.
68) 17) text: Anne backs off.  She stands next to an equally perplexed Jack as they watch Lydia fill out the card.  Her abrasive demeanor is not what they expected.  Lydia finishes the card and pushes it toward them.
68) 22) dialog: (butts in) Only the first ten.  After that they're 2.99 a rental.
68) 23) text: Lydia eyes Anne suspiciously, then turns to survey the shelves.  Parry picks up her card and laminates it -- all the while, keeping his eyes fixed upon Lydia's every move.  Anne and Jack, having set the trap, watch with interest. Lydia surveys the film boxes, H-L.  She spots one of interest and pulls it off the shelf -- causing two other boxes to fall down on her.  She catches one box and, as she replaces it back on the shelf, causes three more to fall.  She catches two of the three. Parry, Anne and Jack watching with an odd fascination. Jack nudges Parry to forget the laminating and go help her.  Parry gathers up his nerve and moves from around the counter, up behind her.
68) 27) text: She moves away abruptly -- like a fox terrier who pretends to ignore the mess she made on the living room rug. Parry turns to Jack and Anne, as if to say "what do I do now?"  Jack encourages him to keep trying.  Parry organizes the boxes and picks one out.
68) 34) text: He doesn't see any.  He looks to Anne, who shakes her head.
68) 38) text: Jack nudges Anne to do something.
68) 39) dialog: You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
68) 41) dialog: (pissed off) Yes!  They'll be in soon.

68) 53) dialog: (interrupts) Twenty dollars.
68) 57) text: Lydia thinks.  Anne is ready to kill Jack.  Parry smiles hopefully.
69) 0) text: Jack searches frantically through a closet.  Anne and Parry sit opposite each other at the table.  Parry is eating Anne's homecooking voraciously.  Anne doesn't quite know how to take Parry, who smiles mischieviously through his meal.
69) 1) dialog: (to Jack O.S.) Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and him... She didn't even look at him.
69) 3) text: As Anne resentfully rises and crosses into the kitchen, Parry focuses on her robust breasts bouncing beneath the sweater.  Anne's expression, as she serves him, is a mixture of repulsion and fascination... She sits at the table.
69) 5) text: Anne looks at Parry as if this were an impossibility. Parry smiles back -- he likes Anne.
69) 6) dialog: I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
69) 9) text: Another opportunity to watch Anne's breasts in action, as she reluctantly rises to get him more macaroni.  She returns with the pot.
69) 10) dialog: I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
69) 12) dialog: Jack, he's starting a conversation...
69) 14) dialog: (cool and polite) Thank you very much.
69) 16) text: Anne looks in Jack's direction, but replies to Parry:
69) 17) dialog: You're surprised!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
69) 19) dialog: Most men are.
69) 21) text: Parry, getting overly heated, slams down his fork.  Anne jumps.
69) 24) dialog: Jack!
69) 27) dialog: What are you, out of your mind!
69) 33) text: Anne looks at him like she's going to belt him.
69) 35) text: Anne, in spite of herself, agrees with him.  She looks to Jack to see if he agrees, but Jack is too busy inspecting Parry.

73) 3) text: ANNE makes a confident nod. LYDIA sips.
73) 5) dialog: It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say, (emphasizing) "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".

78) 10) dialog: What are you two up to?
78) 13) dialog: The nails!! Watch the nails!!... (LYDIA sits back down) Listen, you still have to eat.

80) 10) dialog: I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
80) 14) text: WE HEAR THIS SMACKING OFF CAMERA as we begin on JACK; try to look at LYDIA but having difficulty enjoying his own m CAMERA moves to PARRY, staring at her, helplessly in love paying any attention to his own food; moving to LYDIA "SM SMACKING" , beginning to accept PARRY'S attraction in her warming up to the idea, SHE throws a smile at him in betw "smacks"; and finally ANNE, chewing quietly, staring at J with her eyes widened twice their normal size, indicating disbelief at LYDIA'S vocal variety of noises.
80) 18) text: His gentle voice counterbalances the odd lyrics and makes it sound like a love song. Anne eyes Jack to stop him. Jack is about to make an attempt but can't seem to find the way, so he doesn't bother. Lydia doesn't know how to respond either.  At first she smiles politely, then she pretends to be too busy eating to listen -- but something about Parry's sincerity pulls her in.  His face glows as he floats the lyrics across the table to her.  Slowly, her "smacking" subsides, she lowers her fork, forgets her self-consciousness and listens to Parry -- slightly hypnotized; like a little girl watching a ballerina for the first time. Jack is fascinated by Parry's complete adoration of this mess of a woman.  He looks to Anne, who tries to continue her meal nonchalantly.  He notices her bra strap hanging out from her sweater. CAMERA CUTS BACK AND FORTH between the exposed strap and Jack, as Parry continues seranading O.S.  Anne realizes Jack is staring at her and immediately thinks something's wrong.  But Jack just smiles at her.  His hand reaches across the table, not to fix her sweater, but to take her hand.  Anne is in shock.  She slips her hand into his and smiles back, her eyes almost tearing. When Parry finishes, he smiles.
81) 1) dialog: I tell ya, I'm very surprised. She seemed to go for him. Hmmm... There's somebody for everybody, huh?
81) 4) dialog: Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".

98) 0) text: Outside the bathroom door, we hear the toilet FLUSH. Anne exits in an imitation silk kimono, feeling very much the satisfied woman.  She crosses into the living room and finds Jack, on the phone in mid-conversation, beside his open box of radio tapes.  She hugs him from behind as he talks, still warm from their all night lovemaking...
98) 2) text: Anne releases her hug -- looking surprised, pleased, impressed... she stands by, waiting to ask Jack what's up!

98) 23) dialog: (continuing) ... What?... You don't want to commute?
98) 27) text: Anne breaks away suddenly and looks at him, sternly.
98) 29) dialog: "I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
98) 31) dialog: (aware and suspicious) You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
98) 33) text: Anne shifts her body to face him directly.
98) 35) dialog: Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
98) 37) text: Pause.  Anne stares at him like he's speaking Dutch.
98) 38) dialog: I'm lost.  What are you saying?
98) 41) text: Anne is speechless -- for the moment.
98) 43) dialog: (interrupts) First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as we go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except time?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
