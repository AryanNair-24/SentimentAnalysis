The figure turns out to be a BUM. Grimy face, tattered la of clothing beneath a long over coat, a pork pie hat with twig sticking out of it like a plume in a helmet of yore. Over his shoulder, a homemade bow and arrow set. Although clearly downtrodden, behind his beaten appearanc radiates a calm intelligence and strength. There is somet distinctly attractive and confident about him.

Taken by themselves, the BUMS would look harmless and pat But in the context of their uncharacteristic organization THEY appear frightening. LEATHER and WINDBREAKER automatically whip out switchblad and take a "rumble" stance - as if protecting their catch, Jack. Jack sort of sides with them if for no other reason than - he's known them longer. LEATHER tries to remain confident. HE laughs.
29) 38) dialog: Nothing! They can do nothing! Gentlemen!
29) 39) text: PARRY takes a few steps back and raises his hand. JACK stands close to LEATHER and WINDBREAKER, who prepare themselves for attack.

30) 16) text: The IRISHMAN absent mindedly flicks his cigarette ashes o JACK'S SLEEVE, which is soaked with gasoline. The SLEEVE JACK panics - waving his is arm, trying to get it out. PARRY is both amazed and impressed - seeing it as a sign. The bums talk casually as JACK tries to rip off his coat.
30) 23) dialog: I think they like you.
30) 24) text: This worries Jack. PARRY retrieves him and brings him bac to the group. The IRISHMAN removes the bottle from his saliva soaked mo hands it to JACK, who is disgusted:

31) 6) dialog: (friendly) Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
31) 8) text: He tries to focus his eyes and looks around the room: there is an extremely organized "living area" -- a make- shift kitchen with hot plate, a nail in a wall with clothes on hangers... There is also a dumpster sitting beneath a garbage chute -- The dumpster has planets and stars painted on its side. Jack looks to the far wall and sees a handmade collage mural:  pictures cut out and pasted in a haphazard manner, all medieval in origin; grassy landscape with castles, knights and maidens on horses, crests and symbols of the Crusades, and various renditions of the Holy Grail... One maiden stands out from the rest -- a frail looking doe-like creature. On the adjacent wall, however, there are no pictures. Only frantic scribblings in red marker... Out of the scribblings we can see:  an evil looking face with a bear amateurishly drawn... a large red horse drawn as if it hurt to get out the image... the style is violent and erratic. Jack looks to the other wall and finds Parry's arsenal -- homemade "weapons" that also look medieval, like lances made from mop sticks, nets made of knotted rope, slingshots and a shield made from a garbage can cover with a rose painted on it.  Against each wall are piled, what seems to be hundreds of books.  Jack doesn't know what to make of all this.  He is frightened.

31) 29) text: He picks up a can of wintergreen air freshener and starts spraying, with violent strokes, to shut "them" up... Jack gets more nauseous from the smell... Parry yells to the air:
31) 30) dialog: (continuing) ... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here! (to Jack) They say you're not ready to know.
31) 32) text: Jack makes a move to stand when Parry stops spraying and yells:
31) 33) dialog: Hheeyy!!

31) 50) dialog: (continuing) ... They came to me about a year ago. I was sitting on the john having one of the most satisfying bowel movements -- you know the ones -- where you just see God... And I saw them... just floating around... hundreds of these... cute little fat people... And they spoke.  They said "I" was chosen to help them get back something very important they lost. But my part might be very dangerous. I said "Whoah".... slow down... ya start hearing voices from floating little fat people that tell you you're on a mission for God and you wind up in a mini-series.  Then they said "Look in Architecture Today, Feb '88... page 33..."
31) 51) text: Parry quickly crosses to a pile of magazines, grabs one and dives back to Jack, who keeps scanning for his shoes. Parry leafs through the magazine and opens to page 33.

31) 56) dialog: It's the Grail... The Holy Grail.
31) 59) dialog: I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.

31) 77) text: Parry grabs Jack's hand and shakes it.
31) 79) dialog: Funny -- you look married.
36) 0) text: Jack is alone in the basement.  He slowly walks around the room -- picking up little items here and there, as if trying to discover some clue to Parry.  He scans the titles of the piles of books.  All of them have something to do with medieval history or literature, myths, or the Crusades... He picks up one of the books and opens it... Page after page has been ripped out anywhere there might have been a picture or a diagram.  He comes upon a large scroll that he unravels.  It is a map, drawn by Parry, of Langdon Carmichael's house and the surrounding blocks... He rolls it up... The Pinnochio doll sits on a broken chair facing the wall with the nightmarish scribblings... acting like a sentinel. He crosses to the prominent picture of the maiden with the long hair.  He notices a small stand before the picture, with a candle.  It is like a shrine with offerings:  a flower, a small perfume sampler, a box of Jawbreakers candy and a dime store romance novel.  Jack doesn't understand.

59) 7) dialog: Are there any questions?
59) 9) dialog: Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God... (Jack listens intently) ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.

She catches one box and, as she replaces it back on the shelf, causes three more to fall.  She catches two of the three. Parry, Anne and Jack watching with an odd fascination.

Jack is about to make an attempt but can't seem to find the way, so he doesn't bother. Lydia doesn't know how to respond either.  At first she smiles politely, then she pretends to be too busy eating to listen -- but something about Parry's sincerity pulls her in.  His face glows as he floats the lyrics across the table to her.  Slowly, her "smacking" subsides, she lowers her fork, forgets her self-consciousness and listens to Parry -- slightly hypnotized; like a little girl watching a ballerina for the first time. Jack is fascinated by Parry's complete adoration of this mess of a woman.  He looks to Anne, who tries to continue her meal nonchalantly.  He notices her bra strap hanging out from her sweater. CAMERA CUTS BACK AND FORTH between the exposed strap and Jack, as Parry continues seranading O.S.  Anne realizes Jack is staring at her and immediately thinks something's wrong.  But Jack just smiles at her.  His hand reaches across the table, not to fix her sweater, but to take her hand.  Anne is in shock.  She slips her hand into his and smiles back, her eyes almost tearing. When Parry finishes, he smiles.

82) 18) dialog: Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
82) 20) dialog: So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now... (Lydia is surprised) ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.

I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in... (slowly removes his hand) I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore... (Lydia listens with fascination) ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated (Lydia begins to cry) ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
82) 32) text: She kisses him, tentatively -- almost awkwardly.  Parry feels a surge of emotion that makes his whole body tremble.  Lydia separates from him and looks into his eyes.  She pinches his cheek, hard.
82) 36) text: She runs into the building, afraid to linger and ruin the moment.  Parry stands transfixed, his eyes following her. Lydia pauses briefly to look back.  She is so excited. She smiles and turns toward the elevator... her skirt spinning with her.

His expression grows dark: O.S. we hear a horses HOOVES moving in slowly as CAMERA moves to CLOSEUP.  He slowly turns his head and looks down the block to the corner to see: The Red Knight.  He sits upon his horse as if waiting for Parry.  The street lamps cast a glow around his imposing figure.  The night air lifts his cape up around his massive shoulders. Parry, vulnerable, in love, whispers plainly:

People on the street get out of his way or snicker behind his back.  The Red Knight gallops toward PARRY, as he runs; his face wet with tears -- yet contorting with angry, incomprehensible reprisals.  People on the street pay no attention.

Gone are the little cliques of homeless, once scattered throughout the place.  Gone is the magic and danger that night cast upon the surroundings.  All Jack sees is garbage and decay. Suddenly, SIRENS from an ambulance pulls his his attentio away.  At the same time, the Black and the Irishman (from that same first night with Parry), come running out from between the two giant foundations of the bridge and bolt out of the lot.  Jack smiles in recognition as he moves to block them:

Although most are not getting it, all are having a good time.  When one of the patients turns to look at Lydia, Parry turns as well... His face lights up as he says:
