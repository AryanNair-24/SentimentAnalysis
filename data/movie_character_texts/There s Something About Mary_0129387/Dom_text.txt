18) 1) dialog: Gay? He said you were gay?
18) 5) dialog: Well you're a writer, and a lot of  writers are gay. Look at Truman  Capote.
18) 7) dialog: Let me ask you this: When you smoke  a cigar, do you ever pretend it has  balls? Ted appears to think about this.
18) 9) dialog: I'm going to fix you up with my new  assistant.
18) 11) dialog: You're leaving it out. Finish your  swing. (beat)
18) 14) dialog: I just told you, she's half Asian.  half American. They're all good  looking. You could mate Don Rickles  and Yoko Ono and they're going to  have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof  combo. Ted thinks about it.
18) 19) dialog: Loser? You? Ted shrugs.
18) 20) dialog: Give me a break. Remember five years  ago, when your kidneys failed? If  you were a loser would they have  been able to find a donor with an  exact tissue match? What are the  odds of that, one in a million?
18) 22) dialog: I never said that. I'm saying your  lucky those kids found his kidneys. (beat)
18) 24) dialog: You know, you're a real glass-is- half-empty guy. You got a fucking  guardian angel, man. Ted manages a small smile. Just then, Ted's cell phone RI

19) 16) dialog: I mean since then.
19) 18) dialog: Well why don't you look her up?
19) 21) dialog: Why not?
19) 23) dialog: What if you're wrong? You just said  she's the only girl you ever loved,  what have you got to lose by calling  her?
19) 26) dialog: So that was it? One bump in the road  and you gave up?
19) 28) dialog: You're kidding? What did they say?
19) 33) dialog: I got it--you hire a private eye,  fly him out there, he follows her  around a couple days, she'll never  know a thing. Ted considers this.

20) 0) text: Ted and Dom are walking down a hallway.
20) 2) dialog: Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A  couple years ago he got in a jam up  in the Boston office; some bullshit  about padding his resume--like we  haven't all done that.  Anyway, they  were going to let him go but his  mother wrote a tear-jerker letter  that ended up on my desk.
20) 6) dialog: Yeah, I guess he still lives with  her.  Seemed like a sweet lady--got  diabetes or something--so I went out  on a limb and got him transferred  down to Providence.
20) 8) dialog: He'll do better than that. I'll send  him down to Miami on business, you  throw him a couple bucks on the side,  and he'll track her down. Ted thinks about this.

43) 5) dialog: Well...at least now you know.
43) 10) dialog: I'm sorry, it's just that you're  taking this all wrong, pal. Don't  you see? You're liberated. I feel  liberated. I mean here you've been  in therapy thinking you blew it with  the greatest girl ever, and it turns  out that getting your dick stuck in  your zipper was the best thing that  ever happened to you! Ted flinches at this.
43) 12) dialog: Christ, Ted, I was only four towns  away. Ted thinks it over.
43) 15) dialog: What? On your day off? Do you even  know the guy?
43) 17) dialog: Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish  that damn novel so you can quit that  stupid magazine.
48) 0) text: A buckled-over Ted limps into Dom's office with a crazed  look on his face.
48) 2) dialog: What?
48) 4) dialog: Huh? But why did Healy?
48) 6) dialog: No You mean...?
48) 8) dialog: The lazy fuck just didn't bother to  look her up.
48) 10) text: That sneaky prick was probably  practicing his jai alai. Dom shakes his head. Then:

77) 5) dialog: Didn't they tell you? That hitcher  was just about to cut your throat  when you stopped to take a leak. You  got a fucking horseshoe up your ass,  man.
77) 8) dialog: Flew. (beat)
77) 10) dialog: I hate to ruin your day, Ted, but I  have some bad news for you. Ted SIGHS.
77) 13) dialog: Remember our friend Healy?  Well, I  didn't know where to mail his last  paycheck so I sent my assistant by  his mother's apartment. Turns out  there is no diabetic mom. Landlord  said she's been dead for ten years.
77) 15) dialog: Don't you see?--Healy lied to us  about everything! The landlord said  when he got back from Miami he kept  talking about falling for some doctor  named Mary! Ted is stunned.
77) 19) dialog: His address in Miami. You know, when  you think about it, we really don't  know the first thing about this guy. Finally the implications of this dawn on Ted.
83) 5) dialog: No! You've gone through way too much  to back down now. Get over there and  do something--I can't stand watching  this. BACK ON MARY AND HEALY as Healy starts OVER-DOING IT and  Mary has to break it off.
83) 27) dialog: Attaboy! BACK ON MARY et al - Healy holds his throat, clearly in p

87) 7) dialog: Mints?
87) 9) dialog: Okay, sounds like you're all set.  Just clean the pipes and it's a go.

87) 13) dialog: You jerk off before all big dates,  right?  Tell me you jerk off before  your big dates.
87) 16) dialog: (incredulous)
87) 18) dialog: Think about it: After you've had sex  with a girl and the two of you are  laying in bed, are you nervous?
87) 20) dialog: Why's that?
87) 22) dialog: Wrong. It's because you ain't got  the baby batter in your brain any  more. That'll fuck with your head,  that stuff will.
87) 25) dialog: The most honest moment in a man's  life is the five minutes after he's  blown a load.  That's a medical fact.  And it's because you're no longer  trying to get laid. You're actually  thinking like a girl. They love that.
87) 29) dialog: You bet your ass I'm right. You don't  go out with a loaded gun, you empty  the barrels!

117) 13) dialog: Look at me. Mary turns her head.
117) 14) dialog: Look at me, Mary. On my mother's  soul, on God above, on everything  that is holy to me, I did not steal  your shoes.
117) 18) dialog: All right, I did, but I was in a  weird place then. He approaches her.
117) 19) dialog: Give me a break, Mare, I was nuts! Mary backs into the living room.

119) 48) dialog: Aw shit, this isn't fair. Mary manages a smile.
119) 50) text: I realized something tonight. I'm no  better than any of these guys. None  of them really love you...they just  fixated on you because of how you  made them feel. But that's not real  love...Thank you for letting me see  that. Now I can get on with the rest  of my life. Tucker, Healy, and Dom scoff.
