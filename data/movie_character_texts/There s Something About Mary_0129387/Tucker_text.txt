93) 9) dialog: (matter-of-factly)
93) 12) dialog: Oh yeah, the plan was going along  just fine until you showed up.

116) 55) dialog: Are you shitting me--Mr. Goody-Two- Shoes?  He was like a fucking eagle  scout. You two should be kissing my  balls--if it wasn't for me, she  might've married that schmuck! Ted thinks about this.
