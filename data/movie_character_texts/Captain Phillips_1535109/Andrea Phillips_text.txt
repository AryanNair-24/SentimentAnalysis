But toda it's the center of the world, and Phillips is the reason. REPORTER, his breath fogged, does a remote from the porch ...as we PUSH INSIDE, through a window, to:
6) 0) text: A stone patio, dusted by light snow. ANDREA PHILLIPS sits here, a brief moment of solitude amidst crisis. Behind he see a perfect Vermont pasture, blanketed white. Andrea is the one all those reporters want to talk to. Th wife. Lovely, fierce... but desperate just now. She stare an old NAUTICAL BELL that hangs over a clothes-line. Through the patio doors she sees her SISTERS, her SISTERS LAW, NEIGHBORS. All here to help. But none of them can. On her face, fear. Sadness. She lifts a CELL-PHONE to her ear, hits speed-dial. FOUR RINGS... then she hears:
6) 2) dialog: Hi, Honey. You're gonna have a bunch of hang-ups on this number. Sorry, they're all me; it's the only way I can hear your voice. Dumb, right? Richard, I keep thinking about the airport. Dropping you off like that. I always walk you in and watch the plane take off. Always. So why didn't I this time? I don't know. (a beat) The kids are good. They're both on their way home. Everybody's calling, even people we never talk to, guys I dated thirty years ago. I think they think I'm now available. (half a laugh, then:) Keep looking for me, Honey. Every night in the stars. I'm up there. And I'm looking for you. So I'll see you soon, right? I love you. She shuts the phone, eyes that old SHIP'S BELL overhead.

8) 6) dialog: I'll be with him in a second, Nancy. Nancy nods, relieved. Andrea studies Allison, wary.
8) 7) dialog: I appreciate your being here, Allison. But it's really not necessary. I know how things go. Maersk got their ship back, and all of their cargo, and most of the crew. That's a pretty good result. And sometimes one man gets sacrificed for the good of others. That's the sea.
8) 9) dialog: I see. Then how much are they willing to spend to save him? WHAM. That caught Allison flush. Andrea closes her eyes:
8) 10) dialog: Richard, you have to save yourself.

Phillips is the first thing she sees.

14) 7) dialog: He stayed over so he could see you off this morning.

And every morning I wake up on your side of the bed I must be missing you. Yes, definitely missing you. Miss voice. And I miss those great long LETTERS you used to wr to me when you were gone. E-mail stinks. Love you. Andrea Phillips breathes out a smile, looks out his window - a s full of stars. Then he STOPS. Just heard a BANGING noise. It's outside his door. He opens the door to investigate:

131) 11) dialog: Probably. 81. Amber approaches Andrea, holding a LAND LINE.
131) 13) dialog: Sweetheart, I have to take this; it's the guy from Maersk. I'll call you as soon as I know anything. It's all gonna be okay. I love you...

153) 7) dialog: The Navy's not expecting a good result. Are they. Bam. That put Allison on her heels. She regroups, then:
153) 9) dialog: But they can't launch a rescue without getting him killed. And there's no way the U.S. Government could allow the pirates to take ransom and escape prosecution. So... (Allison's silent) Has anybody said anything to you about preparing me for the worst? No reply. The answer, obviously, is yes.
153) 12) dialog: I think I'll take a walk instead. And away she goes, off the patio and out into the SNOWY F beyond. Allison, helpless, just watches her go. From here, Andrea grows smaller and smaller. We CUT TO:
