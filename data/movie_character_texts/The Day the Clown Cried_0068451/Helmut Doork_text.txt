Helmut slowly CROSSES CAMERA as he takes anoth drink and starts spouting again.

The head Gestapo man nods to them to stay seated and wait and listen.  Helmut continues his rave and gets  more violent as he goes on.  Clause, the bartender, would love to tell him the Germans are there, but chooses to go about his business. Helmut is really getting the effects of the booze now and bordering on flipping his lid, completely.

With an  affectionate smile, Helmut takes her hand and runs it ove his face, pretending that her touch tickles him.  As he  laughs, the child begins to smile faintly.  He shows her traces of chalk make-up on her fingers, and she giggles. His conquest is all but complete.  He picks the youngster up, and holding her like a dancing partner, pretends to d with her to a little tune he hums.  She loves this and la outright.  When Helmut finally puts her down, he kisses h on the cheek and turns his cheek in an unspoken request f a return kiss.  The girl shyly and quickly gives Helmut's cheek a peck.

55) 10) dialog: But... I'll come to see you.  Soon  as I can. And, I want you all to  promise me to be very good.  No  crying. The children stare at him silently, their eyes unconsciou accusing.  With him goes all their security.  Helmut know it, but he has no choice.  When he reaches the door...
