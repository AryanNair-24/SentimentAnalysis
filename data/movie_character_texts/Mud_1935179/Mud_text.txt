16) 30) dialog: Nails. Shaped liked crosses.
16) 33) dialog: Ward off evil spirits. A man I called an Indian but was Meskin said they were Seven-league boots worn by the seventh son of a seventh son. Told me it'd turn me into a werewolf but that's a lie. I don't know nothin' about that. Ellis, confused, won't take his eyes off the man.
16) 34) dialog: They just good luck, but so far they ain't been workin' too well. (missing tooth smile) What's your name? Mud seems easy to smile, which softens his otherwise coar look. His words spill from the mouth rapidly, without muc thought for punctuation. Neckbone, emboldened by these facts, steps forward to answer.
16) 36) dialog: Neckbone? That's a real handle son. Where ya'll from?
16) 39) dialog: Arkansas boys. Ya'll had me worried for a second. Mud, pleased by this news, tucks the fishing pole under h arm and holds out a hand to shake. Ellis stares at the ha unsure. He takes it reluctantly.
16) 41) dialog: I doubt it. I grew up `round here, but I've been gone awhile. 12.

16) 47) dialog: I know it. Guy named Tom Blankenship used to live back in there.
16) 49) dialog: Ain't that somethin'. In one motion, Mud flicks his cigarette away and grabs a out of his shirt pocket.
16) 50) dialog: I like you two. You remind me of me. And seeing how you boys are from Arkansas and we know some people and sounds like we all from the same place I'd say we can make a deal here about somethin'.
16) 52) dialog: Food. Food for a boat.
16) 56) dialog: I would if I could, but I told somebody I'd meet `em here. So I'm stuck for now and what I got's runnin' low. Neckbone walks back and pulls Ellis by the arm.
16) 58) dialog: I'm no bum. I got money. You can call me a hobo `cause a hobo'll work for his living and you can call me homeless `cause that's true for now, but if you call me a bum again I'll have to teach you somethin' about respect that your daddy never did. Neckbone's confidence recedes. Ellis stands his ground.
16) 60) dialog: Yeah.
16) 62) dialog: Yeah. Ellis studies Mud's face, clothes, tattoos. He's thinking about it. Mud pauses from fishing to make eye contact.

29) 21) dialog: There are fierce powers at work in the world boys. Good, evil, poor luck, best luck. Men have to take advantage where they can. Mud removes a spool of fishing line and a small plastic tackle box. He scoops up the duffel bag and heads into th woods.
29) 22) dialog: Ya'll comin'? 32 Neckbone looks to Ellis, who walks after Mud into the trees.
29) 24) dialog: I'm not waitin' for a guy. I'm waitin' on my girlfriend. Juniper.
29) 26) dialog: She's beautiful.
29) 29) dialog: Best lookin' girl I've ever seen. Hands down. Blonde hair. Long legs. She's like a dream you don't want to wake up from. She's got birds tattooed on her hands, here. Mud stops, points to the area on the top of his right han between his thumb and pointer finger.
29) 30) dialog: Nightingales. Good luck birds.

29) 40) dialog: Set that `round your bed at night. Snake won't cross braided rope.
29) 42) dialog: A reminder. Don't get bit. I was 10, swimmin' `bout a mile up from here. Me and Juniper. Sonofabitch swam right up under me, bit me just below the armpit. June got me out, got me to a clinic. Doctor said I shoulda been dead in twenty minutes. Took us an hour just to get back to town.
29) 44) dialog: Gave me antivenom. For a cotton mouth. See here. Mud shows the tattoo on top of his right hand. He points the two cotton blossoms bulging from the snake's mouth.
29) 45) dialog: Problem with antivenom is they can only give it to you once. It's made from horse blood. Your body would reject it a second time. The cure ends up being more dangerous than the poison. 27.
29) 48) dialog: I die, or just sweat it out. Neckbone, not buying it, looks at Ellis and taps his watc
29) 50) dialog: All right.

Elli nervously scans the woods before finally stepping into th light of the campfire. The SOUND of a gun's hammer drawing back CLICKS behind hi Ellis freezes. Mud emerges from the trees, a .45 extended toward Ellis' back.
41) 1) dialog: Ellis? Ellis, still frozen, slowly turns to him. Mud huffs out a laugh and drops the pistol to his side.
41) 2) dialog: What're you doin' out here? Ellis slowly raises the backpack in his hand.
41) 5) dialog: I appreciate that, but I didn't expect you out here at night. Mud takes a seat on the log and transfers the cans into h own duffel bag. He holds up a can of the Beanie Weenie.
41) 6) dialog: Look at that. You really know how to do somebody right. I didn't wanna say anything before, but it's hard to make a meal out of pumpkin pie filling.
41) 8) dialog: I'm not complainin'.
41) 10) dialog: They're yours to begin with. Ellis sits as Mud hands him a can. They eat.
41) 12) dialog: That's good right?
41) 16) dialog: Juniper. Yeah.
41) 18) dialog: We grew up together.
41) 21) dialog: I do. The first time I saw her was on this river. Just up from here. She saved my life.
41) 23) dialog: That's right. I was younger than you are now, but when I came to in the hospital and she was there, it was like the world split open, came back together new. Everything changed. I knew from then on I'd do anything for her.
41) 25) dialog: I've asked. Several times. Marriage just doesn't work for some people. Ellis thinks on this.
41) 27) dialog: I'm sorry to hear that.
41) 29) dialog: Who says that?
41) 31) dialog: I've never been one to trust the government on matters of personal property, but if your parents love each other, there's always a chance.
41) 35) dialog: People just sometimes forget why they fell in love in the first place. Ellis watches Mud toke the cigarette nub. He's really getting all he can from it.
41) 37) dialog: What?
41) 39) dialog: Where'd you see her?
41) 41) dialog: That's good news. Real good news. Mud paces, slowly. He's thinking.
41) 43) dialog: No. We picked another place to meet. Couple days from now. Mud walks back to the log and sits.
41) 45) dialog: Tomorrow. I'll go tomorrow. 39.
41) 48) dialog: Naw. I can manage. Hell I got out here didn't I? Ellis smiles. They sit in silence. Ellis stares up at the boat hanging over them, its peeling hull lit by the firelight.

47) 4) dialog: What state troopers?
47) 6) dialog: I didn't know about that, but it doesn't surprise me. There plenty of folks lookin' for me right now.
47) 8) dialog: I shot a man. Killed him. 45.
47) 10) dialog: I'm sorry I didn't tell ya'll sooner, but I was hopin' to be gone before anything came of it. Didn't want you involved. Mud turns to really face them for the first time.
47) 11) dialog: Ya'll have been real good to me. You're the only friends I got out here. If the state troopers have 165 blocked, they'll have others blocked too. I won't get anywhere in a car. I want to try takin' this boat down, see if we can get it in the water. Ellis and Neckbone stand their ground. They don't say anything. Mud walks back to the steering column. He drops his knees and fiddles with the wires.
47) 12) dialog: With a boat like this I can make it to the gulf in two days. I could get anywhere from there. But I'd need a boat at least this big to make it on open water. It's got no title, no owner, nobody lookin' for it. It's my best shot.
47) 14) dialog: It was a bad piece of business. Ya'll don't need to hear about it.
47) 16) dialog: Juniper made a mistake. She hooked up with a guy. He was no good. His name was Hutchins. Family owns a chain of restaurants down in Texas. 46.
47) 19) dialog: I was around, but me and Juniper were on the outs. She met this Hutchins, he sold her on some lies. Got her pregnant. That's when he started showin' who he really was. He dropped June down a flight of stairs after whoopin' her half to death. She lost the baby. He made it so the doctors think she can't have children anymore. There're things you can get away with in this world and things you can't. I tracked him down at a motel just outside of San Antonio. He was there with another woman. That's where it happened. Mud's done with his story. He goes back to the wiring.
47) 20) dialog: I understand if you can't help me anymore, but I need this boat. And I need to get it in the water fast. After a moment, he sits up and wipes sweat from his foreh
47) 21) dialog: I've made a list. Things we'll need. What do ya'll think? Ellis takes time to consider everything. He looks at Neckbone, who has a disgruntled look on his face.
47) 23) dialog: Yeah. Ellis nods. Mud looks over at Neckbone, who still has the disgruntled look on his face.
47) 24) dialog: What do you think?
47) 27) dialog: That's about it. Mud removes a cigarette butt and sparks it with a lighter
47) 29) dialog: What do you want? Neckbone looks to Ellis, judging his bargaining position.
47) 31) dialog: I only got two things out here worth anything. This shirt... Mud pulls the pistol from the back of his jeans. Neckbone tenses, but relaxes when Mud splays it out on an open pal
47) 32) dialog: And this pistol. I can't give you the shirt `cause I need it for protection, but if you help me get this boat in the water, the pistol's yours. Neckbone squinches his face in thought, sizing up this tr
47) 34) dialog: A forty five.
47) 36) dialog: We get this thing floatin' first. Neckbone looks over at Ellis, who shrugs.
47) 39) dialog: Ya'll scrounge what you can off this list, but if we're gonna get this done right we'll need more help. Can you fetch Tom for me?
47) 41) dialog: I was hopin' to let that old assassin stay put, but we'll need him to get things ya'll can't. Can you find him?
47) 43) dialog: Just tell him my name. He'll know you're serious. Ellis folds the list up. He and Neckbone start down the r as Mud goes back to the wiring.
47) 44) dialog: Boys?
51) 0) text: Ellis runs the boat on shore. Tom splashes into the ankle deep water and helps the boys drag it onto the bank. Ellis takes the lead, walking ahead and scanning the treeline. Mud steps out, just past the shadow of the wood Ellis turns to Tom and points.

51) 10) dialog: In town. Got here yesterday. Tom lowers his head. Frustrated.
51) 19) dialog: I ain't no thief.
51) 30) dialog: Looks like we're on our own. He stands and takes a folded piece of paper from his shir
51) 31) dialog: I didn't want you bein' the one to do this, but I can't see a way around it. I need to get this letter to Juniper. Could you take it to her for me?
51) 33) dialog: You have to be careful. You can't just walk up and knock on her door, you hear me? You have to watch yourself.
59) 0) text: Mud smiles, showing his missing tooth, as he looks over t load of items the boys have stacked in their boat. Neckbo tosses a loop of rope to him. 61A.
59) 4) dialog: This'll work for now. You get her my note?
59) 6) dialog: Where'd you get that from?
59) 9) dialog: What'd he look like?
59) 11) dialog: Dark hair?
59) 13) dialog:

59) 17) dialog: Thanks for lookin' after her. Ellis nods. Mud picks up the rope.
59) 18) dialog: His name's Carver. Brother of the man I shot. If he's here, then more are comin'. 63.
59) 21) dialog: Bounty hunters. Carver's rotten, but his daddy's the one to be scared of. He'll spend all the money he has to see me dead. If it was up to me I'd put the whole family down same as the other. Not a decent man between `em. Mud stops and turns to lay a serious look on them.
59) 22) dialog: Ya'll listen to me now. If you see that old man, don't get near him. He's the triple six real deal scratch you hear me? Mud waits for nods from them both.
59) 23) dialog: All right.
61) 0) text: Mud stands with Ellis and Neckbone on the deck of the boa He holds a pulley in one hand and a length of rope in the other. He stares up into the trees. 64.

61) 4) dialog: Take a foot of line and tie `em off with a bowline knot. You know it?

61) 10) dialog: Tom's the closest thing I ever knew to a father.
61) 12) dialog: It's hard not knowin' the ones you came from.
61) 14) dialog: Tom did that for me. 65.

69) 3) dialog: You find a motor?
69) 5) dialog: I made a bonfire. Mud enters the woods. Ellis follows.
69) 7) dialog: Bonfire's an all purpose cure all for bad luck. I don't know where this boat's been or what kind of person had it before me. For all I know it could have some serious bad business left on it. We got too much ridin' on this thing to leave to chance. Where's Neckbone?
70) 0) text: Mud and Ellis exit the treeline heading to Ellis' boat.
70) 2) dialog: What he say?

70) 8) dialog: She was pregnant with a little boy, but the birth got the better of `em. They didn't make it. Tom's been alone ever since. Lone wolf. Mud has begun walking back to the treeline. Ellis stays.

96) 11) dialog: I need you to take this to Juniper.
96) 13) dialog: Let's go.
96) 15) dialog: I had a dream last night. I saw Juniper laying in a field with another man. They were making love. I walked out into the field. Walked toward `em. I was so angry the tips of my ears were burnin'. That's how I knew I was gonna kill this man. But when I got up close enough, I saw that the man she was with had tattoos on his back, just like mine. I moved in closer and the guy turns his head back toward me. Hair for hair, dead truth, the guy she was with was me. Mud ducks back under the motor. Ellis looks at Neckbone, worried. 96.
96) 17) dialog: I'll finish the boat, but I'd be surprised if I live long enough to sail on it. A vision of yourself is a sure sign of death. Neck can you grab me a socket wrench? Neckbone and Ellis walk to the toolbox sitting nearby. Th crouch by it, speaking quietly.
