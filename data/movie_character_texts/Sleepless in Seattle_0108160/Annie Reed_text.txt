And Annie continues to run, and now we see she's running  across a map of the United States -- it's a little like  the one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- it's  like the famous map of the United States by Saul  Steinberg, but instead of being about New York, this one  is about Seattle. In the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two  indistinct figures -- a map and a young boy.  They start  to wave at her, very slowly. Annie's eyes widen.

59) 7) dialog: I don't even know him.  But  I'm having all these fantasies  about a man I've never met,  who lives in Seattle.
59) 9) dialog: I know, I know.  I do not want  to move to Seattle.  But what I  really don't want to do is end  up always wondering what might  have happened and knowing I  could have done something.   What do you think? (Tom opens his mouth to  say something, but  before anything comes  out, Annie fills the  void) It's just cold feet, isn't it?  Everyone panics before they get  married, didn't you?

67) 14) dialog: I'm going to marry Walter.  I  just have to get this out of my  system.
67) 16) dialog: I should say something in this  about magic.

111) 7) dialog: There is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about  this homecoming that she forget where she is -- in the  middle of the street.  A car HORN blares at her... all  she can do is stare at the nightmare that has unfolded.   She starts to back away -- and that's when she sees --
111) 12) text: Annie, still in shock from her brush with disaster,  hears the Cabbie but doesn't respond.  Stunned, she  turns to see Sam on the other side of the street.  Their  eyes meet.  Sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw  in the airport.

115) 0) text: Becky and Annie looking at the television.
115) 2) dialog: It's a sign I've watched this  movie too many times. (beat) I'm so stupid.  From the minute  I listen to that stupid program  on the radio, I've been a  complete jerk.
115) 5) dialog: I saw her.  She looked just  like this --
115) 8) dialog: Well, it's the same woman.  And  he was crazy about her. (looking at one letter) What is this? (beat) This is from Seattle.
115) 10) dialog: Becky?
115) 12) dialog: (reading the letter) "Dear Annie: Thanks for your  letter.  It was great.  We're  very excited about meeting you  in New York on Valentine's Day  and seeing if we are M.F.E.O.  Sleepless in Seattle."

119) 4) dialog: We're going to the Rainbow Room  and the symphony tomorrow night.
119) 6) dialog: (cheerfully) I hate it. (she stands to go,  starts toward the  elevator) I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I  feel happy.  This is right.   This is real.  Everything else  is what happens when you watch  too many movies and completely  lose sight of what counts. (as she steps into  elevator) Please don't tell anyone about  what happened.  "Sleepless in  Seattle" is history.
120) 0) text: Annie through the train window as the train starts to  move out of the station. MAP OF THE UNITED STATES. The map we saw at the beginning of the movie, as the  light dims in Baltimore and a light goes on in New York.

Each one a variation  on the heart motif.  They move to a window -- "Broken  Heart" -- burnished metal, with tow cherubs flying out  of the wound in the middle.
126) 3) dialog: You go.
126) 5) dialog: I am. (she smiles at him) I was just... I just got... I  think I got nervous.  It's  normal, right? Don't you ever  feel nervous about, you know?
126) 7) dialog: About forever.
126) 9) dialog: Well, I did.  And you know what  I think? I think that it was  almost... too perfect.

128) 1) dialog: It was like kismet but not, if  you see what I mean.

129) 1) dialog: Walter.
129) 3) dialog: It's so beautiful.  It's just  what I would have picked out if  I'd had every ring in the world  to choose from. (as she slips the ring  onto her finger) You see what I mean.  There are  people who would like a  relationship to be full of  surprises, but I am not one of  them. (as she starts out the  door with Walter  behind, thinking about  what she has just  said) Surprises are highly overrated.
130) 1) dialog: (continuing) Promise me something, Walter.   Promise me you will never have  a surprise party for me.  Ever.   You know what happens, you walk  in the door in some horrible  sweater you put on that morning,  and there are hundreds of people  in their best clothes shouting  "Surprise!"

163) 0) text: Annie and Walter.  There's champagne in their glasses,  but neither of them has drunk a drop.
163) 1) dialog: I don't know what to say about  it, Walter.  It was a form of  temporary insanity.  But I had  to tell you about it because --
163) 3) dialog: Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It  was just...
163) 5) dialog: I told you.  Nothing --
163) 7) dialog: I'm not at the top of the  Empire State Building.  I'm  here.

167) 5) dialog: (out of breath) Listen, can I just take a look?  Maybe... maybe... There's  someone I was supposed to  meet... He's probably not  there, but if I don't at least  look I'll always wonder about  it.
167) 8) dialog: You know that movie?
168) 2) text: Annie slowly walks out.
168) 3) dialog: Can I take a minute?
168) 5) text: She sighs.  Heads for the telescopes.  Looks out at the  twinkling lights below. She casually turns the telescope and suddenly sees  something on the floor. Jonah's Seattle Mariners backpack. She picks it up.  She realizes that it might be...  could be... and opens it.  Inside is a toothbrush and  Jonah's teddy bear.

168) 20) dialog: Howard.
168) 21) text: Sam nods.  Smiling.  Starting to put it all together.   Annie smiles.  Still nervous.  No one knows what to do  next.  Just then, one of the elevator operators CLEARS  HIS THROAT.
168) 23) text: Annie nods. Sam holds out his hand.
168) 25) text: Annie slips her hand into his.  It feels comfortable,  natural, right.
168) 26) dialog: Sam?
168) 28) dialog: It's nice to meet you.
168) 29) text: On Annie. On Sam. On Jonah.  He makes a triumphant little double-fist  gesture to himself as the elevator doors close.
