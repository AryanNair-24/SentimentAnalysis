Annie's mother BARBARA,  a beautiful gray-haired, fantastically cheerful woman,  claps her hands together.  Her father CLIFF, who's at  the head of the table next to her, gives Annie a kiss.   Annie's brother TOM and his wife BETSY are at the table,  along with cousin IRENE and her husband HAROLD.  UNCLE  MILTON, who's Irene's father and Barbara's brother.   There are about FIVE CHILDREN there, too.
