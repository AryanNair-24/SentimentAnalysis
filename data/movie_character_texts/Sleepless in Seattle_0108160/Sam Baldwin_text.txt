33) 8) dialog: I don't think I could really  describe it.
33) 10) dialog: And if I could describe it,  it probably wouldn't be on a radio  show. (he laughs to himself) But what the hell.  It's not  one specific thing.  It's more  of a feeling. (continued)

49) 19) dialog: You see someone you like, you  get a feeling about them, you  ask them if they want to have a  drink or --
49) 21) dialog: But not dinner necessarily on  the first date because by the  time you're halfway through  dinner you might be sorry you  asked them to dinner whereas if  it's just a drink, if you like  them you can always ask them  for dinner but if you don't you  can go home if you see what I  mean.

61) 4) dialog: You mean, like, "He has the  cutest butt"? Where did I hear  that recently?
62) 0) text: Sam and Jay at the counter.  Out the window, we can see  water.

I have no  idea.  Is it a twitch? Does  she need a haircut? Should she  use barrette so it doesn't  keep falling in her face?  These are things that I'm  willing to get to the bottom  of, and that is why I am dating  her.  That is all I am doing.   I am not marrying her.  Can you  appreciate the difference?  That's what single people do,  they try people on and they see  if they fit.  But nobody fits  perfectly, everyone is an  adjustment.
