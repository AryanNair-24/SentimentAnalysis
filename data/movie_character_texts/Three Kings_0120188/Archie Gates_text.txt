4) 6) dialog: You said ‘soaring.
4) 8) dialog: Like bullshit. But this is a bullshit story.
4) 10) dialog: Saddam's still here. (CONTINUED)
4) 13) dialog: How about the Shiites?
4) 15) dialog: How about the gold thing?
4) 17) dialog: Okay, forget it, tape these guys over here. Cathy, what's up? Archie and CATHY DAITCH, 30, another reporter, walk off.
4) 19) dialog: You don't need me for this.
4) 21) dialog: You're not going anywhere, you're doing the celebration story.
7) 3) dialog: (out of breath) Just the celebration.
7) 5) dialog: That's it. (CONTINUED)
7) 9) dialog: Like what?
7) 11) dialog: That doesn't mean anything.
7) 13) dialog: There's thousands of bunkers in Iraq.
7) 15) dialog: I gotta keep an eye on Adriana --
7) 17) dialog: You all do.
8) 1) dialog: What's going on?
8) 16) dialog: What stories? You don't have any stories.
12) 2) dialog: I never wanted this job, Ron.
12) 4) dialog: I don't even know what we did over here.
12) 6) dialog: You got your star clinched. (CONTINUED)
12) 11) dialog: Just tell me what we did here, Ron.
12) 13) dialog: Fuck it, I'm retiring, anyway. I don't care.
12) 15) dialog: Fuck that.
14) 2) dialog: Yes, I'm ready to work with you now.
14) 5) dialog: It_was in the guy's ass.
15) 6) dialog: He's French Special Forces, he can help us but he's not gonna talk to me if you're around.
15) 8) dialog: I'm not, I'll bring it to you.
15) 10) dialog: I said you'll get it, okay?
17) 5) dialog: Get the fuck out of my way.
18) 1) dialog: Good afternoon. He looks them over.
18) 2) dialog: Would this be the proctology tent?
18) 4) dialog: Then maybe it's the urology tent, or the neurology tent, or the ear, nose and throat tent.
18) 6) dialog: Is the captain a urologist or a proctologist? They look puzzled.
18) 7) dialog: It doesn't matter. I'm not looking for the Captain, I'm looking for Sergeant Barlow. Archie pushes his finger into Troy's name tape, reaches under the table, and takes the map, smells his fingers.
18) 8) dialog: You're on the path to truth when you smell shit, isn't that what they say? 23 24 23.
20) 3) dialog: Did you good soldiers present this map to your Captain?
20) 5) dialog: I'll take it to him.
20) 7) dialog: Don't get grabby, Sergeant. He stares at Troy, who's in pain.
20) 9) dialog: It won't do either of us any good then, will it? (CONTINUED)
20) 12) dialog: What do you see here?
20) 14) dialog: What do you think is inside the bunkers?
20) 16) dialog: Bullshit. I'm talking about 700 million in Kuwaiti bullion. They all look at him for a moment while it sinks in.
20) 18) dialog: No, not the little bullion cubes you put in hot water for soup.
20) 20) dialog: Saddam stole it from the sheiks, I have no problem stealing it from Saddam. My guess is that he divided his bricks into many different stashes. Just one stash should be easy to take from his surrendering army, and that would be enough to get us out of our day jobs, unless you reservists are in love with your day job. DOLLY: Troy, Chief, Vig stare at Archie.
22) 3) dialog: First we have to be sure the map is more than a love letter from one Iraqi to another.
22) 5) dialog: Maybe.
22) 11) dialog: That's why S.F. is so badass, we get the best flashlights. Still looks like a series of bunkers in three villages. A bit farther to the east.
22) 13) dialog: More like 65.
22) 18) dialog: The grid was swept by the 82nd, but we'll stick to the roads. Leave at dawn, back by lunch. Take a little French leave, we shouldn't be missed, but I'1l have a friend occupy your C.O. just to be sure. What's the guy's name outside?
22) 20) dialog: Bolo, come in here. Walter comes in.
22) 21) dialog: You will tell Adriana Cruz I've gone ahead and checked things out, and you're taking her to meet me.
22) 25) dialog: No. I'll give you a fake copy of this map. You will then take her on a ride that lasts all morning and takes her nowhere near the villages outside Karbala. When you don't find me it's because you got lost, is that clear?
22) 27) dialog: You're gonna take a Chennowth with a radio and drive her out. I'll call you if I need you. Any other questions?
22) 29) dialog: Are you able to control him?
22) 31) dialog: I'll see you at West Gate in the morning.
25) 2) dialog: Come here. They follow him to the side of the road, where a dead body lies next to a bomb crater while a skinny cow loiters nearby.
25) 3) dialog: Is this what you're after? Archie picks up a rusted metal rod and pushes it into the bloated corpse with a HISS of GAS escaping. They pull back and cover their mouths and noses. Chief wretches, Troy backs up and trips over an arm sticking out of the sand.
25) 4) dialog: We dropped a lot of bombs out here. We also buried guys alive.
25) 8) dialog: Bradleys with big plows broke through the berm and buried the trenches.
25) 10) dialog: They had the option to surrender, but they chose to die for their country. DOLLY INTO three terrified Iraqis, eyes open with fear, as the sand rolls over them. END OF FANTASY.
26) 2) dialog: Shot him in the neck, didn't you?
26) 5) dialog: Do you know anything about gunshot wounds? They look at him.
26) 6) dialog: What makes any gunshot wound bad, provided you survive the bullet, is something called sepsis. (CONTINUED)
26) 10) dialog: Say a bullet tears into you right now --
26) 12) dialog: It creates a cavity of dead tissue, the cavity fills up with bile and bacteria and you're fucked. END OF FANTASY.
27) 1) dialog: Then you got the kind of wound that paralyzes or castrates or has a scary name like tension pneumo thorax. That's when a bullet pierces your lung, so every time you breathe, air leaks into your chest cavity, and it fills up like a balloon, crushing your heart, your liver, your lung. Your own breathing kills you, one breath at a time. They look at the corpse.
27) 2) dialog: But we're going to do this without firing any bullets. And just to be sure, we're gonna do a dry run, so put your suits on. 37 32.
28) 1) dialog: Violence of action means your movement is so decisive and powerful, the enemy is frozen and you haven't fired a single shot. We'll say the cow is the primary guard outside the bunker. We pull up fast, stop short, move very aggressively. At last cover, I'm the base of fire.
28) 3) dialog: And -- Go. The two HUMVEES ROAR down the road; Archie stops the rear humvee, drops down, aims his rifle. The cow stares as the first humvee pulls up fast and stops. Troy and Chief jump out, weapons drawn, flank the cow -- The COW steps back, and EXPLODES. Troy and Chief stand splattered with cow entrails. The COW'S HEAD LANDS with a THUD on the hood of the humvee.
28) 4) dialog: Who's hurt?
28) 9) dialog: That wasn't a mine, it was a cluster bomb, very hard to see. (CONTINUED)
28) 12) dialog: Son of a bitch. A piece of cow flesh lands on his shoulder, he looks up. He hears Troy singing quietly.
28) 15) dialog: Move the gear to the other humvee, leave your safeties on, Vig put that stupid pistol away, Troy's the base of fire, no shooting, we hit them with the blinding power of American sunshine. Help me, Rhonda.
30) 2) dialog: It should be right -- He studies the map and points to the gas station with soldiers. (CONTINUED)
30) 5) dialog: There. Vig jerks the wheel right. They drive fast.
30) 6) dialog: No -- there. Archie points left. Vig jerks the wheel left, past the village well and two calm peasants, and drives straight toward the fortress with two Iraqi soldiers in front. Troy drops out of the moving humvee, to his belly, aims his rifle. Iraqi soldiers look scared as the humvee drives up, like it's going to hit them, and stops, flag fluttering in the breeze. Vig stands and speaks into a megaphone as he mans the 60mm.
30) 8) dialog: (hands up) Orders from President Bush, step aside. Troy runs forward when a gaunt MOTHER, with a baby in her arms, opens her blouse, revealing her small breasts. Other peasants gather.
31) 1) dialog: Do not panic. Step outside --
35) 5) dialog: (in Arabic) Where's the gold? The Friendly Iraqi looks at the Stern Iraqi. (CONTINUED)
35) 11) dialog: Where?
39) 1) dialog: Move. Out of the way. Archie shoves civilian peasants out of the humvee.
39) 4) dialog: Give them M.R.E.s. Troy rips open a large duffel and starts handing out Army meal rations and bottled water to the crowd. Iraqi soldiers rip the MREs from the civilians and step on them Vig leans on the HORN. The Friendly Iraqi jumps into the rear of the Hummer as it starts to pull away. Archie shoves the Friendly Iraqi out, and he lands on his ass in the swarm of chasing civilians. Archie and Troy look back the debacle as they pull away. 49 50 THREE KINGS - Rev. 12/16/98 39.
40) 5) dialog: They're after civilians now.
40) 9) dialog: Bush told the people to rise up against Saddam. They thought they'd have our support, they don't, and now they're getting slaughtered. The others, all drenched in sweat, take off their gas suits; their uniforms are underneath. They see two peasants closing the lid on a simple pine coffin, with a tie-died blanket covering the corpse inside.
40) 14) dialog: No it's not. PUSH IN TO Archie as he stares at the map, then thinks.
41) 1) dialog: The real bunker's at the well. In the center of town.
41) 3) dialog: The town we just came from. We went to the decoy bunker. That guy was lying, it's back where we came from.
41) 5) dialog: What is the most important thing in life?
41) 7) dialog: What is it? The most important thing.
41) 11) dialog: Money comes, money goes.
41) 13) dialog: Too dependent on other people.
41) 15) dialog: Close.
41) 17) dialog: Necessity.
41) 19) dialog: People do what is most necessary to them at any given moment. Right now it is most necessary for Saddam's troops to put down the uprising. As long as we don't interfere with that, we can do what we want. They won't touch us.
46) 1) dialog: Faster. (CONTINUED)
47) 1) dialog: (into megaphone) United States Military. Put your weapons down. Troy and Chief leap out, hold rifles at arm's length as they accost the two soldiers disguised as peasants.
49) 2) dialog: By order of the cease-fire signed in Safwan, March third, the United States Military hereby confiscates all material stolen by Iraq from the State of Kuwait -- One of the rifle-loading Iraqis tries to run. Troy heads him off with his rifle --
49) 5) dialog: Keep your goddamn finger off the trigger, Chief. (CONTINUED)
49) 10) dialog: I'm divorced. He throws it on the floor and disarms the Captain. Troy has one Rifle Iraqi on the ground, but the second is on his knees, putting a CD into a mini-stereo.
49) 16) dialog: (to Iraqi Captain) Where's the gold? Tell us so we don't have to kill you.
50) 4) dialog: Take us to the basement.
55) 5) dialog: Listen to me: we leave you alone to beat up your people, but everything you took from Kuwait belongs to us now, understand? He turns to Chief.
55) 6) dialog: Put it back.
55) 8) dialog: Stick to the plan. The plan is for gold and we're not thieves, we're recovering Kuwait's gold, correct? Chief and Troy, out of breath, empty their pockets of jewelry. Archie opens another Vuitton suitcase and pushes it aside -- it's full of Kuwaiti passports. (CONTINUED)
55) 12) dialog: That's ten kilos.
55) 16) dialog: Ten suitcases; sixty bricks each. That's thirty million dollars. Archie, Chief, and Troy look at each other in shock.
55) 18) dialog: Let's see what we're dealing with.
55) 29) dialog: The what?
55) 31) dialog: Why would you know a word like that?
55) 34) dialog: You got any more luggage here? Sa'id looks at him.
56) 4) dialog: I saw a truck by the gas station.
56) 6) dialog: I told you that's handled.
56) 9) dialog: My friend Teebaux is French Special Forces.
57) 1) dialog: He's gonna put it in barrels filled with oil and bury it. In a few weeks, we'll drive it to Yanbu --
57) 3) dialog: It's a port in Saudi.
57) 4) dialog: Where another friend will ship it on a Turkish boat up in the Red Sea to Marsielles, where a French boat will take it to Baltimore -- (CONTINUED)
65) 4) dialog: We take the Kuwaiti gold, yes. (CONTINUED)
65) 8) dialog: No, Saddam cannot keep.
65) 10) dialog: He certainly does.
65) 12) dialog: I think we're all right.
65) 16) dialog: Let's load up and go.
67) 2) dialog: This has to stop.
67) 4) dialog: I don't think so.
67) 11) dialog: Cover me. Troy gets out of the truck, Chief gets out of the humvee, and they nervously point their rifles at Iraqi soldiers who point their guns back. Vig jumps to his feet and mans the 60 mm as Archie walks over to the Iraqi soldier menacing the man in glasses with a knife.
67) 12) dialog: No unnecessary shots, Conrad, cuz we know what they do.
67) 14) dialog: That's right, that's what they do. They watch with trepidation as Archie grabs the Iraqi soldier's wrist, pulling the blade away. The soldier grabs for Archie's throat with his free hand, but Archie grabs this hand, twists it away, puts the Iraqi ina choke hold, drops the soldier to the dirt. The man in glasses, clutching his daughter, runs to the body of his dead wife and weeps while his daughter prays.
68) 1) dialog: I want you to leave this town.
68) 3) dialog: (to Major) Take all your soldiers and get out. (CONTINUED)
68) 7) dialog: No shooting.
68) 10) dialog: Accident. Stay cool. Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun from one Iraqi in the rear to another, but doesn't shoot. Iraqi soldiers point their rifles at the Americans.
72) 3) dialog: Cover these three. Vig swings the mounted machine gun toward the three remaining Iraqi soldiers who stand over eight terrified civilians.
72) 4) dialog: Chief. Chief follows Archie over to the three Iraqi soldiers.
72) 9) dialog: Put the people in the humvee.
72) 11) dialog: Make room.
72) 13) dialog: It just changed.
72) 23) dialog: No. Let's get out of here.
75) 1) dialog: What's the tank doing?
81) 1) dialog: Stay on the road.
87) 1) dialog: Mine. Archie grabs the woman in Western clothing and dives from the humvee followed by Vig, Chief, the Man In Glasses holding the Little Girl, the other civilians, including t two five-year-olds. The Hummer drives ten yards, hits the first MINE with an EXPLOSION and flies into the air --
92) 1) dialog: This isn't sarin. We'd be dead by now.
92) 3) dialog: No, it's C.S.
92) 5) dialog: Tear gas times ten. Where's Barlow?
95) 3) dialog: Don't move. A black-robed figure walks right past Archie, carrying a Vuitton bag, and takes one of the scared twin men by the arm and leads him to the side. (CONTINUED)
96) 4) dialog: Barlow. Two black-robed figures pull Vig off Chief and drag him to the tunnel. Another robed figure pulls Chief to the tunnel. Archie walks, looks for Troy, chokes, vomits into the sand. A black-robed figure takes him by the arm and pulls him back to the tunnel, where they disappear inside.
97) 5) dialog: We have to wait until it clears.
97) 7) dialog: I had no choice.
97) 9) dialog: I_had no fucking choice. Vig starts crying. Chief hands a bandage to Archie, who puts it over Vig's wounded eye socket.
109) 0) text: They enter a cavernous room. A line of ten children with missing limbs and bandages stand and watch Archie, Chief and Vig enter. They make eye contact.
113) 14) dialog: How you doing, Conrad? Vig says nothing.
113) 15) dialog: It was my choice today. You can try to head back if you want, take your share and bury it, I'll find Barlow myself. They look at him.
113) 18) dialog: Okay. Let's check the suitcases.
113) 20) dialog: check the Vuitton suitcases, opening them, looking at the gold, shutting them. PAN TO children in bandages watching Archie inventory the gold. (CONTINUED)
113) 24) dialog: That leaves 92 suitcases, three bars each -- They think.
113) 25) dialog: 23 million dollars. Not bad for a disaster, provided we can find Barlow and not get court- martialled. He looks at Chief and Vig. The Man in Glasses (Amir) puts oil on his little girl's face, they are both crying.
113) 26) dialog: How is she? Amir does not answer.
113) 39) dialog: You got a radio?
113) 41) dialog: Where's Barlow?
113) 43) dialog: Where would they take him?
113) 49) dialog: Take us there.
113) 51) dialog: We'll walk until we find some.
113) 53) dialog: With what? We don't have a radio.
113) 55) dialog: We can't do that.
113) 57) dialog: We're not supposed to be involved with the uprising. We killed Iraqi soldiers. We broke the peace accord.
113) 59) dialog: You're wrong. (CONTINUED)
113) 63) dialog: We need to find our man. How much do you want to take us there?
113) 66) dialog: And you take us to our man.
113) 68) dialog: Archie Gates.
113) 70) dialog: What?
113) 72) dialog: You don't need us. You can buy your way over.
113) 81) dialog: We lost a man for you. (CONTINUED)
113) 85) dialog: Who's going?
116) 1) dialog: Did we save anything from the humvee?
119) 2) dialog: This is the United States Army. Come out of the truck with your weapons in the air. Suddenly Vig's PISTOL FIRES.
119) 7) dialog: They used decoys to throw off our bombers.
122) 7) dialog: No, thank you.
122) 9) dialog: Radio?
122) 11) dialog: No radio, no water, but yes, C.N.N. The other Iraqis nod their heads and laugh nervously.
122) 13) dialog: Not exactly.
122) 15) dialog: Would you explain to these gentlemen that we need a vehicle of some kind? 151 THREE KINGS - Rev. 1/27/99 99.
123) 7) dialog: Listen. We use these cars to go fight Saddam soldiers. Deserter #1 looks at Chief and laughs.
123) 11) dialog: We are the United States military. Deserter #1 laughs.
123) 19) dialog: Listen to me. We will rise up together.
123) 21) dialog: Rise up together. Chief and Vig look taken aback as Archie goes messianic.
123) 22) dialog: Look at_us. Working together. Many races, many nations. Tell him, Chief.
123) 24) dialog: United. George Bush wants YOU --
123) 27) dialog: He wants YOU --
123) 30) dialog: Make the fight for freedom on your own.
123) 35) dialog: Then America will follow.
123) 38) dialog: God bless America, and God bless a free Iraq. Iraqis burst into cheers. The Hairdresser Twins are going nuts.
123) 39) dialog: What do you say now, my friend? He puts his hand on Deserter Leader's shoulder.
123) 41) dialog: Then I guess we'll have to buy them.
128) 1) dialog: We get our man, we come back to pick up the gold --
128) 5) dialog: The way a scary thing works is, sometimes it's best not to do it at all, but when you have no choice like now, you do the thing you're scared shitless of, and you get the courage after you do it, not before you do it.
128) 7) dialog: I know, but that's the way it works.
164) 14) dialog: Let's go.
172) 1) dialog: Keep those people inside.
172) 4) dialog: Keep your fucking guard up. (CONTINUED)
172) 17) dialog: We can talk about this later, okay?
172) 19) dialog: He's with us. Troy and Amir look at each other his pistol at Amir.
172) 25) dialog: He helped us find you.
173) 3) dialog: Cover him. Chief looks around frantically with his pistol pointed. Archie scans the area and directs three civilian riflemen to spread out.
173) 4) dialog: Lock it down. Shoot anything that moves.
173) 24) dialog: Goddamn it. He runs hard across the desert toward Troy. Troy falls next to Vig and they look at each other. Troy's eyes are wide with pain as he breathes with great difficulty -- rasping.
176) 4) dialog: I've been waiting 18 years to get that right. He tears open a short IV tube and plunges the IV into the scalpel hole. There is a small valve on the end of the tube, which he tightens. A GUNSHOT sounds -- Archie turns and looks over -- 222 223 thru 224 225 THREE KINGS - Rev. 2/17/99 119.
178) 4) dialog: Good. Take him there. Troy tightens Vig's wrapping.
179) 1) dialog: Air pressure will build up about every fifteen minutes. Release the valve, close it up again. Archie unscrews the valve on the tube in Troy's chest, and AIR HISSES out. Troy looks relieved. Archie closes the valve. (CONTINUED)
179) 5) dialog: Maybe four hours, if you're not bleeding too bad inside.
179) 9) dialog: (into the radio) Bolo, this is Brer Rabbit, do you read me?
179) 11) dialog: No, we're not. Chief watches, tense.
179) 12) dialog: (into the radio) Bolo, this is Brer Rabbit.
180) 2) dialog: Where are you?
180) 6) dialog: We're about ready for the briar patch, over.
180) 10) dialog: You got me, Bolo?
180) 12) dialog: You do.
180) 14) dialog: No, the other way around.
181) 1) dialog: I need three personnel trucks and a humvee. (CONTINUED)
181) 5) dialog: Talk to my friend Teebaux. Each driver will get 100K.
181) 7) dialog: Roger. Brer Rabbit at 239 North. Add one medavac pack to the order, and be sure to bring the reporter.
183) 5) dialog: Let's give them their gold; leave ours buried.
186) 1) dialog: Tell them to hide it very carefully. No one can see it.
187) 4) dialog: Those better be words of sympathy. Three army drivers (Berm Soldier #5, Camp Soldiers #10, and #11), among them the disillusioned infantrymen interviewed by Adriana Cruz earlier, get out of their vehicles, greeted by Chief, Archie, and Amir. Walter walks up, carrying a medical pack.
187) 13) dialog: I called you, didn't I? Teebaux pushes an IV needle into Archie's arm and tapes the penicillin sack to Archie's shirt.
187) 15) dialog: No, that's still somewhere in the desert for all I know, but we lost one of our guys helping these people.
187) 17) dialog: Shoot the story, help them out.
187) 20) dialog: Bullion ees buried. I'11 show you after we get these people to the border.
187) 22) dialog: Iran. Part of the deal. (CONTINUED)
187) 27) dialog: I doubt they heard us.
192) 2) dialog: I see an opening we can walk through. But it's not wide enough for a truck. Archie gets out of the humvee and looks at the border.
192) 3) dialog: We'll walk them to the border. The Iranians will take them. We'll walk back to the trucks and get out of here. Chief turns and signals to the drivers to come up. Troy takes the safety off his M-16. Three U.S. drivers (Soldiers #5, #10, and #11) get out with their rifles ready. They release the safeties. Teebaux stays back to man the mounted machine gun on the humvee. Iraqi soldiers on the border nervously watch the Americans and the civilians, holding their machine guns.
194) 1) dialog: Make a close group. (CONTINUED )
199) 1) dialog: Double time. He lets go of Troy and starts jogging toward the border. Troy cannot jog, he crouches down, and is passed by the others. The civilians look up at the choppers as they jog Chief and Walter look up also. Archie does not. Teebaux in the humvee swings the mounted gun up to the CHOPPERS as they pass overhead, LOUD. PAN UP TO three Blackhawks hover over everyone's heads and land in the fifty yards between Archie and the border, blocking his path, blowing up dust. Archie, Troy, Chief, Amir, the civilians turn and wince i the blowing sand. Ten U.S. military police jump from the landing choppers, followed by another ten U.S. troops with rifles, includin Berm Soldier #1. Iraqi soldiers watch apprehensively. MP's grab Archie, Troy, and Chief, and pull them away from the civilians. Troy shouts OVER the CHOPPERS.
201) 1) dialog: Let them get over the border. Troy pulls away from the MP's, resisting arrest.
201) 4) dialog: Put his cuffs in front. He and Chief are pulled away from Troy.
203) 8) dialog: Goddamn it, Ron, give him medical attention --
203) 10) dialog: Cut his cuffs. PAN ACROSS Paco taping --
206) 1) dialog: You're gonna let this shit happen? You want that to be the story?
206) 3) dialog: We got the gold.
206) 6) dialog: We got the Kuwaiti bullion.
207) 1) dialog: Pull that barrel.
207) 6) dialog: Four tons. General Horn picks up a gold brick.
207) 9) dialog: They helped us get it, Ron. I made a deal, and that's soldier's honor. You can't fuck them now. General Horn looks at Archie.
207) 10) dialog: You can return this gold, save some refugees, be a big hero, clinch your star. Everyone stares at General Horn. After a pause, the General FIRES his PISTOL into the air.
