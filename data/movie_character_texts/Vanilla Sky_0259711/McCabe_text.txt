81) 18) dialog: (continued) But I needed more. I needed an answer. I... I even thought there was more than a good chance someone was playing tricks on you. Maybe it was the board. But I can't exceed my duties here. I'm just a psychologist, and I have to leave you.

Infomercial. Push in on the reverse. It's David at the window as he realizes the true meaning of "Ellie" -- L.E. He bangs on the glass, at first slow, then faster, yelling for McCabe The L.E.

88) 0) text: Aames and McCabe sit and wait in a warm wood-paneled office, proposals in hand. A glimpse shows words like Re- Evolve and Re-Experience, peppered with colorful photos o simple, life-affirming portraits of everyday life. It's well-appointed and well-marketed organization. McCabe regards David as the victim of a lunatic's scam. Injustice fuels McCabe.
88) 1) dialog: (continuing, scoffing) "Cryonization - a journey of re- awakening after the preservation of the human body at extremely low temperatures."
88) 3) dialog: (a little sadly) David, you're not- Account Liaison REBECCA DEARBORN enters with paperwork. She is an electric presence. Efficient, caring and oddly compassionate.
88) 8) text: 92 The DNA codes of the human body have been broken. Soon, heart ailments, cancer and so much more, will be a thing of the past. Very simply, your anguish... your discontent... even your death is no longer necessary in a traditional sense. Whatever malady that hides behind that mask... is temporary. She looks directly at David, and it stirs him. McCabe studies her, and the operation. He thirsts for clues. David flips through the folder - toward the back, a panel of photos of storage tanks. Lavishly and warmly photographed, just like next year's cars in a magazine.
88) 10) dialog: Did you sign this contract, David? David looks down at pamphlet, looks up.
88) 13) dialog: (rueful, skeptical) "Cryo-tainment. " Dearborn spreads apart the paperwork on her desk to revea a thin Video Monitor built into the glass table-top. Aame and McCabe peer into the table--top as Dearborn presses play.

100) 31) dialog: 
100) 34) dialog: Mortality as home entertainment. This cannot be the future. Can it? David regards McCabe. Once dynamic, McCabe now seems unsure of his own existence. Slowly, always looking at David, he settles into the truth of his very being. With great nobility, McCabe shoves his hands into his pockets and faces his own destiny... or lack thereof.
100) 35) dialog: (quietly) Goodbye.
