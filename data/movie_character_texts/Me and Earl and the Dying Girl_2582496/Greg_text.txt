I like this girl Rachel, and I’m gonna be pissed if she dies at the end.” So I’m just telling you: Don’t freak out. She survives. When I said someone dies, I meant someone else. So hopefully that reassures you. Although actually, why would it.

They find it and are wowed. They just can’t get over how great these tulips are. So, “A Box O’ Lips, Wow.” The worst part is, tulips might not even be in the budget anymore -

A menu that only has food that will humiliate you for four years. So it’s kind of a Mexican standoff, in which I carry this thing around forever, until my mom has irritated me to death.

14) 14) dialog: (Werner Herzog voice) The highly selective admissions process of college weeds out the cruel and the stupid. And so a college is quite different from the senseless chaos and sickening enormity of high school. High school is the mouth of a great demon, biting and chewing and smushing people in the face. It is simply overwhelming. (dropping the Herzog voice) In seriousness, I am looking forward to college because I never fit in in high school. Because of my weird rodent face -

15) 14) dialog: But people probably already think that. Because you gave those stupid films to Rachel. So basically I've become completely conspicuous, like, all the time. People look at me, they think, filmmaker. When they’re not already thinking, cancer girl’s boyfriend.

30) 1) dialog: Hey.
30) 3) dialog: I know. I look amazing. Here, let me put flowers on you.
30) 5) dialog: Before we watch this, uh... I’m really sorry it took so long to make. But the reason for that is, we couldn’t figure out how to not get it to suck. And we never did figure it out. It still sucks, and it’s not actually what I wanted to say to you. But let’s just watch it first. Okay? She nods. He turns on the projector. It projects onto the curtain. sits next to her, and they watch for a while. The film does, as advertised, suck. First, there are the TESTIMONIALS: students sitting in a classroom, saying clichéd things, or unhelpful things. So those suck. DENISE’S INTERVIEW has been jarringly edited so as not to depressing, but of course this makes it even more depress It goes without saying that this sucks. And spliced among all of these sections is a mysterious ANIMATION that is never explained and never gets enough t to develop. It’s confusing. How could that not suck? As they watch, Rachel begins to cough, weakly. Greg ignor this for a few coughs. Then he realizes that it isn’t going away.

34) 7) dialog: This film sucks. And after you watch it, you’re gonna think I’m this pathetic untalented loser. But here’s the thing: I don’t care what you think about me. I’ve spent the last four years obsessing over how everyone sees me, and I just realized, I don’t care anymore. (MORE )
34) 9) dialog: The only person whose opinion I care about is dead. So, whatever. He puts the mic down, then decides to pick it back up.
34) 10) dialog: I’ve always wanted never to be noticed by anyone. But the best way not to be noticed is to be dead. And I don’t want to be dead. He puts the mic back. The principal, frowning, walks over reclaim the mic. Then Greg abruptly grabs it a third time.
34) 11) dialog: Wait. Here’s why our film sucks. It’s not the film we should have made. Okay? Because I wasn’t even friends with Rachel before she got sick. And then she got sick and we spent all this time together, but it wasn’t enough. It just wasn’t. To make the film we should have made, we should have gotten her to tell us every single thought she has ever had. Because it’s all just lost, now. We should have had a camera on her, constantly, since the day she was born. Because her whole life, now, it’s just lost. We should have had a camera inside her head, because all of her specific thoughts and ideas and hopes and phobias and all of her impressions of the whole stupid world, they’re all about to be lost, and the film we should have made would keep her from being lost. And I know that happens to everyone. It’ll happen to everyone in this room. And it'll happen to me. But I don’t care. All that I can think about is that it happened to her. And it happened last night. And I can’t deal with it, I’1l never be able to deal with it, and this film has nothing to do with that. Nothing. (forcing back tears--semi- incoherent) It sucks. Nothing sucks more than this. It sucks. 94 95 Blue (6/3/14) 96. He puts down the mic and walks, then runs, offstage and o of the auditorium. The students are baffled.

It is beautiful and stran There are three small figures in it. Somehow we know they Rachel, Greg, and Earl. Rachel’s has pink hair. He runs a finger over the lip of this little fantastical place that her hands made. He gazes at her bookshelf. He pulls out a book - no carvi in there - another one - again no carving - another - This one is carved out too. A different landscape. Two figures - Rachel (the same color, but her old brown hair) one who is probably her mom. He finds more and more. A world of landscapes. Different styles, from different times in her life. Sometimes he kn who the figures are, and sometimes he doesn’t. The figure that is her is always recognizable. There is no broad narrative connecting them. They are jus scenes. Not necessarily from her life - perhaps something tangent to it. At some point we are no longer seeing the book carvings - are just watching his face, as he SEES in a way that he n has before.

35) 1) dialog: I know I might seem to you like I hate myself and everything I do. But really, I just hate everyone I’ve ever been. The person I am right now is okay. Rachel’s ashes were scattered in a park behind her house. Apparently she ran away from home once and tried to live there. It was this story her aunt told at the funeral. She was trying to become a squirrel. She thought she could turn into one by just being in the forest and wanting it really bad. I guess maybe that’s what Mr. McCarthy meant, about someone’s life continuing to unfold. It was weird to be learning something new about Rachel after she died. But somehow it was reassuring as well. The printer has just stopped printing the story we have j been told. On the back we see the words, “Somehow it was reassuring as well. FIN.” He puts it in an envelope addressed to Pittsburgh State University - Department of Admissions. And then he puts a DVD in a jewel case.
