College is 15-20. And if you don’t want to live with other kids, go to school around here! Go to Pittsburgh State! Live at home! Don’t get me wrong.

He pulls out a book - no carvi in there - another one - again no carving - another - This one is carved out too. A different landscape. Two figures - Rachel (the same color, but her old brown hair) one who is probably her mom. He finds more and more. A world of landscapes. Different styles, from different times in her life. Sometimes he kn who the figures are, and sometimes he doesn’t. The figure that is her is always recognizable. There is no broad narrative connecting them. They are jus scenes.
