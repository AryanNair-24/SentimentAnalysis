It is beautiful and stran There are three small figures in it. Somehow we know they Rachel, Greg, and Earl. Rachel’s has pink hair. He runs a finger over the lip of this little fantastical place that her hands made. He gazes at her bookshelf. He pulls out a book - no carvi in there - another one - again no carving - another - This one is carved out too. A different landscape. Two figures - Rachel (the same color, but her old brown hair) one who is probably her mom. He finds more and more. A world of landscapes. Different styles, from different times in her life. Sometimes he kn who the figures are, and sometimes he doesn’t. The figure that is her is always recognizable. There is no broad narrative connecting them. They are jus scenes. Not necessarily from her life - perhaps something tangent to it. At some point we are no longer seeing the book carvings - are just watching his face, as he SEES in a way that he n has before.
