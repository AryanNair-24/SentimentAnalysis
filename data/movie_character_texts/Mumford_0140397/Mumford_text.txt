That  meant the revenue officers had to  use all their "collection tools" --  seizures, liens, levies -- even if a  more reasonable compromise could  have been worked out. The best way  to reduce resistance from the  taxpayers was to build a convincing  case -- whether there'd actually  been a violation or not...

80) 1) dialog: The parties met repeatedly over a  period of months. The IRS offered to  settle for a sizable but, they said,  fair amount. Worrell said he'd done  nothing wrong and threatened to fight  it all the way to Washington. He  seemed pretty strong. I was secretly  pulling for him. McLure and the  District Manager stepped up the  pressure.
81) 1) dialog: What none of us down at the Service  knew was that Edmond Worrell had a  story too... Worrell's was that he'd  been fighting chronic depression for  thirty years. Under the heat of the  investigation, he fell off his  medication. One Tuesday morning, he  went down to the factory early, wrote  his family a letter, then used the  9mm automatic they kept there to  kill himself...

87) 4) dialog: That'd be Lily.
87) 6) dialog: Who'd you go with? (Skip: "alone") That's not good.
87) 8) dialog: You know how easy it is. A kid can  manage it if he wants a fake I.D.  You can do practically the whole  deal at your local Kinko's. The only  variable is how much pride you take  in the product.
87) 10) dialog: All new people start with that...
88) 1) dialog: With desktop publishing, you don't  have to deal with printers, supply  houses, or pesky government agencies.  Eventually you do have to get your  hands on a typewriter. Ever seen one  of those, Skip?

90) 1) dialog: ...Mickey Mumford was in Miss Rice's  kindergarten class with me. He was  killed with his parents in a wreck  on their way back from a Steelers  game. He was only six years old,  which is a real plus, so there's a  birth certificate if anyone checks --  but not much else. They died in  Pennsylvania, so there's no death  certificate in West Virginia... that's  also good.
90) 2) text: ON A KITCHEN TABLE, the new birth certificate, now filled out for Michael Mumford, is carefully lifted from a shall bowl of light tea (the tea bags are nearby).

95) 27) dialog: I don't have one really. Most of the  time I'm faking it. See, I think  there's not much that can be done  about most problems... they're too  complicated, too deep-rooted by the  time I hear about them. The most I  can do, usually, is look and listen  real closely, try to catch some  glimpse of the secret life everybody's  got. If I can get a sense of that,  well then, maybe... just maybe, I  can help them out a little.

W at first appears chaotic is, in fact, carefully organized Many different disciplines interface here: THE BODY SECTION: The first thing one notices -- some  incredibly life-like, anatomically correct,  sculpture/mannequins -- both male and female. You half ex them to breathe. From there, a full wall of forms descend from store mannequins and skeletons all the way down to a huge variety of inflatable sex dolls. THE CYBER SECTION: A dizzying array of computers and scre some showing wire-form outlines of body parts in repeated motion. Above them, on a huge corkboard, hundreds of comp generated renderings of skin, eyes, limbs, sexual organs. THE BODY PARTS SECTION: Medical models of teeth, eyes, li limbs. Hundreds of porn store samples: plastic dildos, ru vaginas, sucking machines and sundry genitalia. THE FORM-CASTING SHOP: All the machinery you need to make rubber and acrylic forms of anything that can be computer designed. All these weird objects are set upon shiny, spotless, hig tech work surfaces. Skip watches Mumford move about in aw picking up the odd item.

MUMFORD'S MOVING POV: A young couple is embracing and tal intimately. As they separate, we can see that it is Nessa and Martin Brockett. Martin sees Mumford, but makes no si Nessa twists to see what Martin's looking at just as the  view is interrupted by a wall. Mumford walks on, mulling what he's seen.

105) 4) text: Mumford seems hesitant, but nods. Follett takes out an Ex knife and makes the first incision, but as he's about to on, Mumford suddenly reaches out and stops him.
105) 5) dialog: Let me just say something here... I  have no idea if this is going to  help.
105) 7) dialog: You remember when I asked you about  pornography --
105) 9) dialog: -- and you told me that. Still,  there's some kind of imagery that's  haunting you and, I think, getting  in your way --
105) 11) dialog: But you did come to me.
105) 13) dialog: My guess is these images were burned  into your brain when you were young.  Maybe if we could nail down the exact  fantasies that are haunting you --  maybe you could get past them...  Anyway, I thought we could try an  experiment.
105) 15) text: Mumford nods, but suddenly looks depressed, distracted.
105) 16) dialog: You know what? I think this was a  dumb idea...
105) 18) dialog: ...I just heard myself talking and I  realize I'm completely unqualified  to be doing this. Let's forget the  whole thing.
105) 21) dialog: (pulling on the box) There's absolutely no reason to think  this is going to have any impact on  you. I'm embarrassed to have --
105) 24) text: Mumford gives up. Follett gestures to ask whether it's sa to put the box on the desk; Mumford reassures him. Now, w much more anticipation and ceremony than before, Follett  carefully cuts open the package. THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX is revealed as Follett opens the  flaps. There is an inner, brown paper wrapping upon which has been set a low-rent catalogue: "METROPOLITAN COLLECTI Periodicals, Erotica, Adult Nostalgia." Follett lifts awa the wrapping -- There are perhaps a dozen men's magazines of the late fif and early sixties: Nugget, Adam, The Adam Reader, Swank,  Dude. Plus several cartoon collections: Sex to Sexty, Sta Humor. Plus trashy adult novels of the era, with provocat illustrations on the covers: Night Call Nurse, The Neighb Have No Curtains, Secretarial Sluts, etc. Finally, two vi tapes, both of Russ Meyer films: MUDHONEY and COMMON-LAW  CABIN. We stay CLOSE ON the contents of the box as Follett's han shuffle through it, rapidly flipping through the pages. V soft-core by today's standards, the common thread is clea voluptuous, heavy-breathing sirens in tight clothes (and of them) tempting muscular, he-man drifters or libidinous businessmen. A world of lusty secretaries, siren babysitt and frustrated, neglected wives. In other words, exactly erotic ambience of Follett's fantasies. SLOW TILT UP TO FOLLETT'S FACE. He is transported, mesmer galvanized. In fact, at this moment, as the MUSIC SWELLS, tear is rolling down his cheek. He dare not take his eyes from this Holy Grail to look up at Mumford. The only thin that could wreck his mood now, is --
105) 30) text: It takes Follett a moment to understand, but when he does his whole manner changes. He dismisses the Young Pharmaci with a nod, then gives a quick, self-conscious glance to  Mumford.
105) 32) dialog: My pleasure.
105) 35) text: He hurries out. Mumford stands up to leave, but first loo down through the one-way mirror. WHAT HE SEES: Follett hurries up behind the prescription  counter, where Althea Brockett is waiting; once again she looks quite sexy. Follett brings her prescription up and  begins playfully flirting. Althea is responsive. Follett  motions Althea down the aisle, where it's more private. H comes out from behind the counter, ostensibly to show Alt something on the prescription bottle. Althea leans back  against some shelves in the same posture as the Landlady Follett's first fantasy. Mumford reacts, bemused.
