Nessa quickly lights her  cigarette with the lighter concealed in her hand and stan up too. She exhales a huge cloud of smoke and walks quick to the back door of the office, which Mumford has opened her, and goes out. Mumford waves half-heartedly at the cloud of smoke as he  walks to the door to the waiting room and opens it. MUMFORD'S POV: As the door swings open, the first figure see is Mr. Cook; he twists around at the sound of the doo He acknowledges Mumford and then sighs as he steps aside reveal, sitting exhausted in a chair, his daughter -- SOFIE -- a young woman whose actual appearance is somewha disguised at present by her wan, ashen visage. She regard Mumford with some resignation. Her father helps her out o the chair. Sofie keeps her eyes on Mumford. CLOSE ON Mumford, watching her.
24) 0) text: LATER. Mr. Cook is gone. Sofie is sitting up on the couch facing Mumford. She looks like she might pass out at any  moment, but her voice is stronger than you'd expect.
24) 2) dialog: I'd better not, I'll fall right to  sleep. I think it's too soon for me  to be sleeping with you.
24) 5) dialog: Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting  to tell you... (tiny smile, to herself) ...about my exhaustion. I didn't  really want to come. I'm not hopeful  right now. But I couldn't take the  look on my dad's face. He's a truly  kind person, which is pretty  extraordinary if you knew the story.  He's the opposite of me, I guess --  all stamina and resolve.
24) 8) dialog: About six months ago, I guess it is  now. God, it seems like years. What  a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before  this happened -- when I'd hear people  talk about this kind of thing -- I  thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
24) 11) dialog: You think that now! You think it's a  bunch of hooey, don't you?
24) 13) dialog: I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
24) 15) dialog: That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother  always says -- "Everything that's  wrong with you is in your head." I  suppose that's true.
24) 17) dialog: No... but it started one year to the  day after my divorce became final.  That's not too suspicious, is it?...  But it wasn't like I was feeling bad  about the divorce. Just the opposite.
24) 19) dialog: Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
24) 21) dialog: Even if you don't think it's real?
24) 23) dialog: What would you do?
24) 25) dialog: I don't know. I barely made it today.
24) 27) text: Sofie suddenly looks defeated.
24) 29) dialog: I don't think I can afford it. I  don't want my dad paying.
24) 31) text: Sofie gives him a long look.
24) 32) dialog: You have the best answer for  everything. (Mumford shrugs) You seem so... hopeful. Are you always  this sunny?
24) 34) dialog: Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone  agrees my immune system's way down.
24) 36) dialog: Can I ask you something? (Mumford: of course) Didn't you tell my dad you didn't  think it was a good idea to come to  the patient? (he admits it) So what changed?
35) 1) dialog: I'm not making any promises.
35) 3) dialog: (seeing something) Oh boy... this should be interesting.
35) 5) dialog: Hello, Mother. I want you to meet  Dr. Mumford.
35) 10) dialog: We're going for a walk.
35) 12) dialog: Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself  completely in his hands. For today,  anyway.
35) 17) text: Mrs. Cook is not amused. Sofie pulls on Mumford.
35) 18) dialog: We'd better go or I'm liable to bail  on the whole thing.
36) 0) text: Mumford and Sofie, foreground, walk slowly up the block. the background, Mrs. Cook watches for awhile before going inside.
36) 1) dialog: Mom's such a cutie.
36) 3) dialog: She's not in a bad mood. She's like  that all the time. (a beat) It doesn't bother me anymore. It's  my dad and my brother I worry about.
36) 5) dialog: (laughs) Is that the technical description of  what I've got?
36) 7) dialog: We don't discuss it.
36) 9) dialog: Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me,  especially, but Dad, of course. She  thinks my brother's all right, but  she didn't expect much. It's what  happens when you "marry beneath  yourself"...
36) 10) text: Sofie suddenly seems to be fading.
36) 12) dialog: What?
36) 16) dialog: You've got a funny idea of funny.
36) 18) dialog: No.
36) 21) dialog: Is this the treatment?
36) 23) dialog: 'Cause I'll tell you, none of the  others have tried this approach.
36) 25) dialog: (absurdly unconvincing) Hey, 'Just do it!'
37) 0) text: ANOTHER DAY. They're dressed differently. Sofie seems mor vigorous.
37) 1) dialog: I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
37) 3) dialog: Well... I'm tired all the time,  obviously. I always feel like taking  a nap. But when I try to sleep, I  have trouble. (Mumford nods) My muscles ache. And my joints. I  feel like an old person, or like I  did back when I used to work out too  hard... What else?...
38) 2) dialog: Uh-huh.
39) 0) text: Sofie nods.
39) 2) dialog: Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also...  I get confused.
39) 4) dialog: Where?
40) 0) text: ANOTHER DAY. Mumford is leading Sofie through the lightes set of calisthenics ever devised. Now they're doing waist bends and arm waving. Even so, it's taking everything Sof got.
40) 1) dialog: I don't know if I mentioned the  headaches.
40) 3) dialog: No, not really. They're about the  same. My marriage was one long  headache.
40) 7) dialog: Is that like a party trick?
40) 9) text: Sofie's not sure how to take that. She looks away.
40) 11) dialog: You actually address yourself by  name in your thoughts? (Mumford laughs) So you really think having two  opposing ideas in your head does  some kind of damage?
40) 13) dialog: Well then, my life has been some  kind of huge rip.
92) 0) text: Mumford and Sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely fir light. Mumford has a canvas sack full of newspapers aroun his neck. At each house, he consults the list in his hand then hands Sofie a rolled-up paper, which she throws -- w varying success -- toward the front doors. The activity i tiring for her, but she's committed.
92) 1) dialog: ...so we get on this incredible steam  engine train that runs up into the  mountains... (she tosses a paper,  grunting) ...and this trip is everything it's  cracked up to be... an open car,  great views, the mountain air blowing  through. We're sitting there, married  for six years, and he says how he  likes it better when I put my hair  back...
92) 3) dialog: That wasn't so good.
92) 6) dialog: I don't know if I'm going to make it  the whole way.
92) 8) dialog: Oh... this makes me sound irrational,  which is probably right, but there  was something about him saying this --  it was maybe the millionth time he'd  told me about some preference of  his. Well, I was so... tired of it. (memories) Seems like my whole life someone's  been telling me... I'm just not  getting it right. Can we rest for a  second?
92) 10) dialog: You're purposely making me talk while  we do this... (Mumford nods) ...because you think this is good  for me... (nods again) ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
92) 12) dialog: ...who thinks there's nothing really  wrong with me.
92) 15) dialog: That was really bad, wasn't it?
92) 17) dialog: And I'll bet you can interpret the  whole thing
92) 19) text: Sofie starts walking again, taking another newspaper from his sack. He points to the next house.
92) 20) dialog: I hate those dreams where everything  means something.
92) 21) text: Sofie heaves the paper squarely onto the porch. She turns him with pride, but when she sees the way he looks at her she glances away, uncomfortable.
92) 23) dialog: No, that'd be a good story, but that  was just the beginning of the end.  We went on for another year or so.
92) 25) dialog: So whose route is this?
92) 27) dialog: And he's where?
92) 29) dialog: (heaves another paper) I'm thinking a gal could make a good  living doing this. How hard could it  be squeezing out some fourteen year  old?
92) 31) dialog: It's all right.
92) 33) dialog: And this is legitimate therapy?
106) 0) text: Mumford and Sofie make their way slowly up the trail. Des her labored breathing, it's clear Sofie has made enormous progress since we first saw her.
106) 1) dialog: When I was in high school we used to  come up here and make out. I liked  to sit on the rock and watch the sun  go down.
106) 3) dialog: Which thing?
106) 5) dialog: Why'd you come to the house the other  night?
106) 7) dialog: My brother said you were about to  fire me.
106) 9) dialog: I bet I know what changed your mind... (Mumford looks at her) ...My mother. She was so horrible,  you decided you couldn't desert me.
106) 11) text: Sofie gestures ahead.
106) 12) dialog: That's the cut-off, isn't it? (Mumford nods) I know why you were going to quit  seeing me.
106) 13) text: Mumford slows at this. Sofie heads off the trail into the woods.
107) 0) text: Sofie appears first, but she waits for Mumford before she steps tentatively onto the rock. Mumford takes firm hold her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle herself.
107) 1) dialog: You feel like a fake, an imposter...
107) 3) dialog: ...as if maybe you don't know what  you're doing.
107) 5) dialog: Everybody feels that way sometimes...  like we're not who we're supposed to  be. But I have to tell you, Dr.  Mumford --
107) 7) dialog: -- you've been a tremendous help to  me.
107) 9) dialog: I can't tell you how much I admire  you. You have a wonderful way with  people. And you're very insightful.  I feel like you've seen me clearly...  I never used to admit what a horrible  person my mother was. You've made  that possible for me.
107) 11) dialog: Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never  accepted me for who I was, just like  Mother. The things you've said have  helped me understand what a dick he  is.
107) 13) dialog: You're shockingly honest, that's  what makes you great. I've never had  a man treat me this way. With you, I  feel really... listened to. (gives him a look) Can I tell you something? It's a  little embarrassing, but I feel very  unguarded with you.
107) 15) dialog: Thanks to this therapy, I now know  what I'm looking for. I need to find  a man like you. (laughs) Not one who's treating me, of course. (full of resolve) And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've  given me the confidence.
113) 5) text: Mumford stops him with a "don't mention it" gesture. Foll accepts and goes out the back door. Mumford is pleased so still wants to use that door. Mumford returns to his desk and begins reading some paper when he HEARS the entry door to the waiting room. Not  expecting anyone, he checks the clock, then goes to his o door and opens it. Sofie is standing there, very agitated, just about to kno She peers past him to see if he's alone.
113) 6) dialog: I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can  I come in?
113) 8) text: Sofie sits on the couch. Mumford sits in his chair, facin her. Her voice is as strained as her manner.
113) 9) dialog: We haven't met in this office since  that first time. This is how a real  professional and his client are  supposed to see each other.
113) 11) dialog: It might've been more appropriate if  we had followed a traditional approach  to the doctor-patient relationship.
113) 13) dialog: Yes, something's very wrong, Dr.  Mumford.
113) 15) dialog: How intuitive! That must take years  of training right there. Maybe you  can guess what has upset me.
113) 18) dialog: No, it is not something I've heard  about you! It is someth-- (stops suddenly) Why? Is there something I should  have heard about you?
113) 20) text: Sofie suddenly finds it difficult to look into his eyes, looks around frenetically for a moment. Then, indicating couch --
113) 21) dialog: May I?
113) 22) text: Mumford gestures "of course." Sofie swings her legs up an lies on the couch so they can no longer see each other's  face. (It's the most vigorous movement she's yet shown us This seems to help Sofie a bit.
113) 23) dialog: All right... I'm going to come right  out and say this, because that's  what your shrink is for, right, so  you can tell him what's bothering  you?
113) 25) dialog: (tone still rough) First of all, I have been feeling  much better lately. I don't know if  the syndrome is over -- if it's just  run its course or something -- but I  feel a hundred per cent better than  when I first came to you.
113) 27) dialog: Given that, I'm obviously not going  to be judging things in the most  realistic way.
113) 29) dialog: (sharply) I'm saying that since I'm doing so  much better -- which I attribute to  you -- I'm liable to misinterpret  some of my feelings.
113) 31) dialog: The point is this -- I am not a blank  page. I did not just fall off the  turnip truck. Do you know what I  mean?
113) 33) dialog: I know a little about psychology. I  took three different courses in  college. It's true, none of them  were above the two hundred level,  but I took them... And there was one  concept I remember very well.
113) 35) dialog: Transference!
113) 37) dialog: Yes, and that is what I have got  right now. I have taken my feelings  of gratitude... and relief... and  transferred them onto... you. I have  taken all those warm, grateful  emotions and confused them with  feelings for you... So that now I am  under the delusion... (a deep breath) ...that I am in love with you.
113) 38) text: Mumford appears frozen in his chair. There is a heavy sil in the room. Sofie does not look back there.
113) 39) dialog: Hello?
113) 41) dialog: I think you can understand why I  have some serious questions about  your methods. I mean, obviously it  becomes much more likely that I'm  going to have confusion about this  when your idea of treatment is to go  walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly  romantic activities --
113) 42) text: Suddenly, Sofie's voice cracks. She is starting to cry, b refuses to acknowledge it.
113) 43) dialog: -- We had a paper route together,  for godssake! Do you understand how  I might be a little resentful? Knowing  that this so-called "love" I'm feeling  is totally bogus, and just a pathetic  case of... transference?
113) 46) text: Silence. Then Sofie gets up, wiping at tears with the bac of her bare hand. Mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue, but she ignores it. She will not meet his gaze.
113) 47) dialog: Maybe you ought to think about how  you're going to fix this. And when  you do... (suddenly losing her  will) ...please get back to me.
113) 48) text: Sofie turns to go out through the waiting room, but after step, she stops, pirouettes and goes out the back.
117) 6) dialog: Mother...
117) 7) text: Mrs. Cook glances inside at the as-yet-unseen Sofie, then hisses at Mumford --
117) 9) text: Sofie appears behind her mother.
117) 10) dialog: Mother...
117) 14) text: Both Sofie and Mrs. Cook are set back for a moment. Mrs.  Cook recovers fastest --
117) 16) dialog: (scary strong) Mother... go away!
117) 17) text: Mr. Cook suddenly appears, takes Mrs. Cook by the arm and makes her vanish. Sofie and Mumford are left alone. She l at him through the screen.
117) 19) dialog: Which show was that?
117) 21) dialog: Part of it. We were watching "ER"  until someone called.
117) 23) text: Sofie comes outside. She doesn't get too close or look at him as she walks to the other end of the porch.
117) 24) dialog: Do you know what a betrayal this  is?...
117) 26) dialog: ...How violated I feel?
117) 28) text: Sofie turns sharply to look at him, ready to blow up.
117) 29) dialog: You feel violated?
117) 31) dialog: You deserve it.
117) 33) dialog: I should be irate.
117) 34) text: Mumford immediately perks up. Sofie tries to correct --
117) 35) dialog: I am irate!
117) 37) dialog: But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This  is a terrible thing you've done.
117) 41) dialog: What?
117) 43) dialog: I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad  mood.
117) 46) dialog: Oh.
117) 49) dialog: I sort of do...
117) 51) dialog: ...but first, you have to tell me  something...
117) 53) dialog: What is your name?
118) 26) text: WE PUSH IN on Mumford and Sofie, who embrace.
118) 27) dialog: You got off easy.
118) 29) dialog: We're only talking about six weeks.
118) 31) dialog: Of course... I haven't got the energy  to get out of town that fast.
