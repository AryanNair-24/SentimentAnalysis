295) 0) text: And suddenly it's dead-quiet. We're in a vault inside a vault in the basement of the main building. Mendez's suitcase is laying on a low counter, an ARCHIVES OFFICER t-tagging and cataloging various items. Separating Mendez's personal things from material related to the operation. Mendez empties his briefcase and the officer puts a sticker on the VARIETY featuring the ARGO ad. Another on the ARGO script. He's putting things into a box that reads: USCIA CLASSIFIED MATERIAL. Mendez opens his accordion folder -- flips through it -- it's empty -- no. There's something inside. In one of the compartments is a STORYBOARD FROM ARGO. One that the Komiteh missed. While the Archives Officer is turned around, Mendez slips the storyboard back into the accordion folder and puts it back with his personal things.
