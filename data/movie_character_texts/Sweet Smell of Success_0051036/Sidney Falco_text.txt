20) 111) dialog: (his anger relapsing)
20) 115) dialog: A CLOSE SHOT.  While Elwell continues, he is not looking Sidney.  Elwell's expression of dislike of Hunsecker is n overemphatic; but Sidney senses, nevertheless, that it is very real - and this gives him a new idea.
20) 122) text: Sidney has rapidly resumed his manner of resentment (in order to exploit Elwell's dislike of Hunsecker).
20) 123) dialog: You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy! (a pause, then:)
20) 127) dialog: (morose)
20) 131) text: Like most of the human race, Sidney, I'm bored.  I'd go a mile for a chuckle... Elwell's voice fades: his attention has been caught by...

20) 140) text: The nature of Elwell's reading tastes is also not lost on Sidney.  With his eyes glancing at the magazine, Sidney n accepts the original offer to sit down.  He produces the slip of paper that Bartha rejected, offering it as illustration.
20) 141) dialog: This is how much I'm washed with J.J.... As Elwell reads, Sidney continues giving a passing scruti apparently casual - to a picture of a girl on the magazin cover.
20) 142) dialog: Look, Otis, I make no brief for my bilious private life, but he's got the morals of a guinea pig and the scruples of a gangster. Elwell shows no undue enthusiasm for the item.
20) 144) text: A fine, fat dirty item. (offering it back to Sidney)
20) 145) text: Who's it about? But Sidney doesn't take the paper back; he explains:
20) 146) dialog: A kid named Dallas, who runs a dinky jazz quintet. (he leans closer)
20) 150) dialog: It's a real goody if, like me, you wanna clobber J.J.! Now Elwell lays the item down in front of him.  Clearly, is considering it.  Sidney prompts again.
20) 151) dialog: He's got his TV tomorrow.  He'd read it just before rehearsals. Elwell nods.  But he is still reluctant.
20) 154) dialog: Sidney drops his eyes to the magazine once more.  He fing it in a preoccupied but significant way.
20) 155) dialog: (gently)
20) 160) dialog: Waiter!  The check.

21) 15) dialog: I thought you two could talk the whole thing over till I got back. Rita looks at him sharply.
21) 17) dialog: One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night. He grins at Rita.  She doesn't respond.  Turning, she goe swiftly through the door into the bedroom.
21) 20) text: Elwell looks at Sidney; Sidney looks at Elwell.  Elwell g up slowly from the settee.
21) 22) text: Consternation reigns... Sidney is uncomfortable, not sure how Elwell is taking th rejection.  Elwell glances at his wristwatch, lays down h drink.

22) 4) dialog: (nodding with emphasis)
22) 8) dialog: (explosively)
22) 11) dialog: What kind of an act is this? Rita jumps to her feet.  Her righteous indignation is handicapped by the lop-sided stance caused by the lack of one shoe.
22) 13) dialog: (caustic)
22) 17) dialog: What sort of thing?
22) 20) dialog: (as emphatic)
22) 22) text: Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School? A pause.  Sidney has struck brutally home.  Rita's lower trembles.
22) 24) dialog: (persuasively)
22) 25) text: Honey - he's going to help you! You want to lose your job? Rita begins to waver, her moral indignation losing ground before Sidney's reminders of her dire necessity.
22) 28) dialog: (cutting in)
22) 32) dialog: (cutting in to reassure her)
22) 35) text: - that's what I mean! This attempt at humor signals to Sidney that he has broug her round.  He comes to her, pats her in an encouraging manner - to which she does not respond. He turns to the door, and picks up the glasses she has se down on the table behind it.
22) 36) dialog: (as he opens the door)
22) 37) text: How many snorts does it take to put you in that Tropical Island Mood? Sidney goes out.
22) 40) text: Havana!  That's where we met! Rita shakes her head morosely.  Sidney comes and puts a stiff drink into her hand.  Elwell raises the glass toast the girl, encouraging her to drink.  Rita responds dimly.
22) 42) text: Here's mud in your column! Sidney laughs, more from relief than from the joke.
22) 43) dialog: Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
22) 45) text: Hurry back. At the door Sidney takes cheerful leave of them.
22) 46) dialog: Don't do anything I wouldn't do. That gives you lots of leeway.

Smirking w satisfaction, Sidney turns away from the CAMERA and throw the paper into a trash basket before he disappears into t impressive entrance of a large office building.  The sign above the doorway reads: THE NEW YORK GLOBE.
31) 2) text: I have no power to retract, Mr. Cummings... I'm only Mr. Hunsecker's secretary.  No.  Nor can I agree that can retraction is necessary. Thank you for calling. Sidney has come through the newsroom in background.  He pauses tactfully, seeing Mary occupied with the lawyer.
31) 9) dialog: Hello, Mary, me darlin' and phwat are ye up to today? Sidney's hand caresses her shoulder with a gesture which indicates a certain intimacy between them.
31) 11) dialog: What about?
31) 13) text: Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you... Sidney reaches for the phone.  As he does so, Mary hesita and glances at a copy of The Record which lies on the des open at Otis Elwell's column.  She picks it up.
31) 15) text: Is that the man who manages Susie's boyfriend? Sidney murmurs casually, "Yeah.  Why?" as he dials.  Mary holds up the paper, indicating the item.
31) 17) text: "The dreamy marijuana smoke of a lad who heads a highbrow jazz quintet is giving an inelegant odor to that elegant East Side Club where he works.  That's no way for a card-holding Party Member to act. Moscow won't like, you naughty boy!" Sidney accepts the paper from Mary, examines the item whi he talks to Sally on the phone.

31) 24) text: If this is true, J.J.'s going to hit the ceiling... Sidney moves around behind Mary.  His eyes are fixed on a spike which sits on Mary's desk.  On it is impaled a proo of Hunsecker's column.  Meanwhile, he remarks:
31) 25) dialog: Can it be news to you that J.J.'s ceiling needs a plaster job every six weeks?
31) 26) text: From Sidney's viewpoint, Hunsecker's column.  The shot is just too distant for us to be able to read the print.
31) 29) text: Sidney, you know that J.J. doesn't like people to look at the column proof in advance... Sidney, caught "in flagrante", laughs.
31) 30) dialog: Mary, I'm not "people" - there's Falco blood, sweat and tears in that column. He turns away, changing the subject (apparently).
31) 31) dialog: How about dinner tonight? Mary turns to study him.
31) 33) dialog: (uncomfortable under her scrutiny)
31) 34) text: And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart? Mary is thoughtful.  Without malice, in a detached sort o way, she examines Sidney.
31) 36) dialog: (cynical)
31) 37) text: Mary, don't try to sell me the Brooklyn Bridge.  I happen to know it belongs to the Dodgers. Mary, smiling, decides "to let him off the hook".  She ta the spike and the column and passes it across to Sidney's side of the desk, as she returns briskly to her business.
31) 39) text: I don't mind you looking at the proof of the column in advance, as long as J.J. doesn't know.  But don't do it like a boy stealing gum from a slot machine. Sidney doesn't like this; but, on the other hand, he does want to look at the column.  After only a momentary strug he picks the column off the spike and reads.
