1) 1) dialog: So what’s the upshot?
1) 8) dialog: Keep your voices down.
1) 14) dialog: Shh.
1) 31) dialog: (over) You have to keep your voices down, Joel Pforzheimer is sitting out in the house.
1) 33) dialog: GQ. He’s been shadowing you for a week, did you notice?
1) 35) dialog: Just look like everything’s fine, he’s sitting out in the house. We reveal the 2,600 seat house which in 40 minutes will b filled to capacity. We’re at the launch of the Mac. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 4.
1) 41) dialog: (to STEVE) It’s 20 seconds out of a two-hour launch, why not just cut it?
1) 43) dialog: Yeah, you just (cut it).
1) 48) dialog: I understand, but the ad said the Mac was gonna save the world, it didn't say it was gonna say hello. ANDREA CUNNINGHAM, a 26-year-old publicist for Apple, cal from the back--
1) 54) dialog: Why not?
1) 57) dialog: Why can’t he get into the machine?
1) 59) dialog: What kind of special tools, just take a screwdriver. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15
1) 62) dialog: (to STEVE) Is this for real?
1) 67) dialog: Oh Jesus Christ--cut “hello.”
1) 69) dialog: What’s the first rule of a launch?
1) 76) dialog: He needs to talk to you. ANDREA CUNNINGHAM, the 26-year-old publicist, calls back-
1) 86) dialog: Steve-—
2) 1) dialog: You need special tools to open the Mac?
2) 3) dialog: I didn’t know literally, Jesus. JOANNA opens a door marked “STEVE JOBS” and gives STEVE a push into-- INT. STEVE’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS The room’s been set aside as a place for Steve to chill, alone and prepare during rehearsals and before the big presentation. There’s a Mac (the original Mac) on a small table. There’s also a large, unopened carton that was recently delivered.
2) 4) dialog: And if you keep alienating people for no reason there’s gonna be no one left for it to say hello to.
2) 9) dialog: We--listen--we haven’t advertised the voice software. We could pull it out of the demo and no one would be disappointed. Do you want to try being reasonable just, you know, to see what it feels like?
2) 11) dialog: Thank you.
2) 13) dialog: I see, you just (tricked me a little).
2) 15) dialog: Sculley’s not gonna cancel the launch ‘cause he’s not insane.
2) 18) dialog: Nothing you need to worry about, don’t even open it. STEVE opens the flaps on the box and pulls out an issue o Time magazine. “Machine of the Year” is on the cover with picture of a computer. It’s a carton full of copies of Ti
2) 20) dialog: Somebody thought--
2) 22) dialog: --doesn’t matter--thought it would be a good idea to have copies of that Time cover available at everyone’s seat. It was nipped in the bud and all the copies are being taken out of the building-- they’re probably already out of the building so...problem solved.
2) 24) dialog: I understand.
2) 26) dialog: I’m sure the thinking was--
2) 29) dialog: --that since the computer is Man of the Year that that’s good for our business but like I said I’m having them removed from the building.
2) 31) dialog: Okay.
2) 33) dialog: I’m not telling you who it was, it was done without malice, it’s been taken care of, you have a half-hour and we have things to talk about.
2) 35) dialog: Like a million in the first 90 days--
2) 37) dialog: Twenty thousand a month after that.
2) 39) dialog: I’m begging you-- 11. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15
2) 42) dialog: --because this is my field. I am begging you to manage expectations out there.
2) 44) dialog: (over) We’re not gonna sell a million in the first 90 days.
2) 46) dialog: Maybe, but what happens when they find out that for twenty-four ninety-five there’s nothing you can do with it? STEVE stares at her...
2) 47) dialog: (pause) We were competitive at 1500 but once you replaced the Motorola 6809 with the 68000--
2) 49) dialog: Yeah, ‘cause everyone needs rectangles with rounded corners.
2) 51) dialog: (beat) I don’t have the first fucking idea what that means but this is how it got to $2500. 12. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15
2) 54) dialog: Which is the price point on the PC which can do a lot more.
2) 56) dialog: If the goal was ease of use, maybe you should've given it some memory.
2) 58) dialog: I’m just asking you to (manage expectations).
2) 60) dialog: Not instantly. When people heard “Rite of Spring” they tore the chairs out of the theater, they didn't buy the record. 13. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15
2) 63) dialog: Yes, exactly, but Igor Stravinsky didn’t say he was gonna sell 20,000 units a month.
2) 65) dialog: Look, obviously--let me say this-- obviously Daniel didn’t think he was doing anything wrong.
2) 67) dialog: Yeah.
2) 69) dialog: You said--when you told me the story, you said, “Dan, did Michael Moritz ask you if I had a daughter named Lisa?” and Dan said, “Yeah” and you said, “What did you tell him?” and Dan said, “Yes.” My point was that he answered you simply and honestly because he didn’t think he’d done anything wrong.
2) 74) dialog: (beat) Well...
2) 76) dialog: She's waiting for you.
2) 78) dialog: Chrisann.
2) 80) dialog: They're out in the hall. They've been sitting in the back of the auditorium since seven this morning, she wants to talk to you.
2) 82) dialog: Who was gonna stop her?
2) 84) dialog: We issued 335 press credentials for the launch, Steve, you piss off Chrisann and she’s gonna stand in the lobby and give 335 interviews and you, pal, will be longing for the halcyon days of Dan Kottke. 15. STEVE JOBS -—
2) 87) dialog: I’m not.
2) 89) dialog: I find this all excruciatingly personal and I’m not staying.
2) 91) dialog: Fine. STEVE goes to the door, opens it and steps out
3) 11) dialog: Nice to see you. Hello, Lisa. We’ve met before and you told me you liked the way I talked and that was my favorite thing anyone’s ever said to me.
3) 13) dialog: Yes I am. Do you know where that is?
3) 15) dialog: I think you’re thinking of the North Pole.
3) 17) dialog: (heading for the door) I’ll leave you guys alone.
3) 20) dialog: (over) I’m going to check in with Hertzfeld. (to LISA) We're trying to get a computer to say hello but right now it’s being very shy. Would you come help me? (to CHRISANN) Is it okay?
3) 26) dialog: (pause) You about done?
3) 28) dialog: (to LISA) Come. Let’s make that computer say hi. LISA’s still absorbing the “Lisa” information... STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15
3) 33) dialog: Come on, hon. JOANNA and LISA exit.
3) 67) dialog: I’ve got Andy here.
4) 24) dialog: Does anyone know where the closest psychiatrist is?
4) 28) dialog: Yes. Which one of the no stores that are open at 8:45 do you want me to have someone run to and return from in 15 minutes?
4) 30) dialog: Does it have to be a white shirt, is blue okay?
5) 29) dialog: One of the engineers.
5) 42) dialog: (to STEVE) Woz wants a minute.
5) 44) dialog: And Sculley’s asking for you. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 33.
5) 58) dialog: I’m deeply uncomfortable.
5) 61) dialog: Joanna Hoffman.
5) 64) dialog: As Steve said, I run marketing for the Macintosh team.
5) 66) dialog: Thank you.
5) 68) dialog: No, I went to MIT.
5) 70) dialog: The health and dental. CHRISANN doesn’t laugh.
5) 71) dialog: (pause--smiles) He’s not so bad. (MORE )
5) 74) dialog: And if I spent every hour of every day with people who were dumber than I am I bet I'd be an asshole too. CHRISANN nods...
5) 76) dialog: You two are so good together, I don’t know why you couldn’t make it work. STEVE’s tying his tie.
5) 78) dialog: (pause) You must be able to see that she looks like you.
5) 80) dialog: I know you heard (what I said).
5) 82) dialog: I don’t care what the test said-- 10 STEVE JOBS -—
5) 85) dialog: I don’t care about 94.1% or the insane algorithm you used to get to 28% of American men--
5) 87) dialog: (over) There’s a small girl who believes you're her father, that’s all, that’s all the math there is. She believes it. What are you going to do about that? STEVE’s done with his tie. He puts a disk in his shirt po and tries taking it in and out. Then he grabs his jacket-

19) 7) dialog: Wait, you’re gonna demo a 128 computer on a 512?
19) 10) dialog: (to ANDY) And you think that’s borderline unethical?
19) 12) dialog: Please--you have to tell me why it’s so important for it to say hello.
19) 15) dialog: (pause--resigned) The computer in 2001 said hello all the time and it still scared the shit out of--
19) 17) dialog: Just for this. And just for now. The house lights go out and we hear the audience break in THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 50.
19) 20) dialog: Alright. Okay. Go make a dent in the universe, Steven.
21) 13) dialog: While we’re holding there are well- wishers in the VIP room. They start heading off stage--
21) 15) dialog: And Woz is here.
21) 18) dialog: Why are you in a good mood?
21) 20) dialog: John Sculley’s here too. STEVE doesn’t like hearing that and he takes his frustrat out on the door as he pushes it open and they walk into--
22) 1) dialog: It’s nice that he’s here.
22) 3) dialog: And Andy Hertzfeld. You have to see them, they want to pay their respects.
22) 5) dialog: You have to see them anyway.
22) 7) dialog: Look--
22) 9) dialog: Can I tell you something? STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 64.
22) 12) dialog: Can I tell you something?
22) 14) dialog: You said you wouldn’t compete with them and you designed a computer specifically for the education market which they putatively own so I think it’s cool they're here.
22) 16) dialog: Still it was nice they came.
22) 19) dialog: I don’t know but I’m sure it can be traced back to you. You know I’m the one who has to explain you to people. $100,000 to Paul Rand for a corporate logo when we didn’t even know what our company made. A $650,000 mold for the Cube because God forbid the angles are 90.1 instead of 90. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 65.
22) 22) dialog: On the Cube or the factory? As if customers are out there thinking, “You know I'd buy that thing except I’m not sure I like the color of the walls at their plant in Fort Worth.”
22) 24) dialog: Don’t give them a reason to say to the press you have a chip on your shoulder, will you do that for me?
22) 26) dialog: (trying not to laugh) Okay, but don’t give them a reason to say you do.
22) 28) dialog: That’s the right attitude.
22) 30) dialog: Get one out of the way.
22) 32) dialog: Yeah? 32 33 STEVE JOBS -—
22) 35) dialog: Sure.
22) 37) dialog: No--why?
22) 39) dialog: How long do you think that’s going to work?
22) 41) dialog: Tell me what I don’t know. I mean it, tell me.
22) 43) dialog: (pause) Okay. Who do you want first?
22) 94) dialog: I think you two have met.
22) 98) dialog: And they're telling me George is ready for you to look at the focus.
22) 108) dialog: Yeah. STEVE joins WOZ out in--
26) 0) text: JOANNA’s waiting.
26) 2) dialog: We're out of time. They’ve got to mop the stage and open the house. STEVE looks at her...
26) 4) dialog: You'll make a joke.
26) 6) dialog: If it crashes it crashes.
26) 8) dialog: (quietly) I’m not just talking about the demo. Steve? If it tanks we don’t swallow cyanide, we go back to the drawing board.
26) 10) dialog: Tell me what the plan is. You have to tell me the plan because I don’t know. You're walking around like you've got can’t-lose cards.
26) 13) dialog: Will I have to drop acid?
26) 15) dialog: Is there a plan?
26) 17) dialog: Every single goddamn time.
26) 19) dialog: Is there?
26) 21) dialog: (pause) Start 15 minutes late so Avie (can recompile and try to give us a fighting) --
26) 23) dialog: Fine.
26) 25) dialog: But where do you come down on starting late? STEVE takes a moment... STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 86.
26) 28) dialog: Kids do that when they’re scared one of their parents is in a bad mood. They try to get you talking about something you like. It’s very common and can be treated by talking to her about things she likes.
26) 30) dialog: No.

28) 8) dialog: Can he do it later, Joel, we go in 8 minutes.
28) 12) dialog: I’1l1 tell you on background--
28) 14) dialog: I’11 tell you on background that I’ve never seen anything like it in the tech industry. I called the Wall Street Journal to take out a full page ad for today and you know what their sales guy said? “Why bother? It'd be like notifying Macy’s that tomorrow is Christmas.”
28) 16) dialog: I did.
28) 18) dialog: The headline was “Dear NeXT: When Can I Get My Machine?”
28) 21) dialog: We’1l announce the ship date in the next 8-10 weeks.
28) 23) dialog: We have a lot of respect for Stewart Alsop and we want to get a machine into his hands so he can tell his subscribers about it.
28) 25) dialog: Very soon.
28) 27) dialog: Off the record?
28) 29) dialog: We think--
28) 39) dialog: I think that’s enough.
29) 7) dialog: (confidentially to JOEL) It’s not a problem. STEVE’s walking over to ANDY and AVIE, who are busy on th computer.
29) 38) dialog: Andy, he’s only got a few minutes.
29) 40) dialog: Can we all enjoy it later?
29) 46) dialog: Give it to me, I’1l throw it out for you.
29) 50) dialog: You ready for Sculley?
29) 53) dialog: You can’t shout. STEVE heads up the metal stairs and onto--

55) 5) dialog: (calling to the stage) We’re opening the house in 10 minutes, Steven, you want to stop horsing around?
55) 8) dialog: I have the correct time and we’re running out of it. “A great keyboard.”
55) 13) dialog: I don’t know.
55) 24) dialog: Let’s hold off on those. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 131.

55) 38) dialog: Yeah.
55) 40) dialog: They’re all great.
55) 45) dialog: We’re gonna start on time. We're starting on time.

56) 12) dialog: Look what he said.
56) 14) dialog: It was.
56) 16) dialog: Sightings of J.D. Salinger are more common than John Sculley.
56) 20) dialog: No.
56) 22) dialog: I'd have told you if I did.
56) 24) dialog: Let’s get off the stage. STEVE and JOANNA open the heavy door that leads out into-
57) 1) dialog: You see how this door looks like this door? If you go through this door you're backstage, if you go through this door you're ina parking lot.
57) 3) dialog: Did you hear what I just said? 95 96 STEVE JOBS -—
57) 6) dialog: I want to talk to you.
57) 8) dialog: Don’t worry about it.
57) 10) dialog: I don’t know, you’re both out of your minds. Listen to me--
57) 13) dialog: Make everything alright with Lisa.
57) 15) dialog: You’ve come to my apartment at 1AM and cleaned it so tell me where the boundary is.
57) 18) dialog: If I give you some real projections will you promise not to repeat them from the stage?
57) 20) dialog: Conservative projections.
57) 22) dialog: We've been managing expectations so that you don’t not.
57) 24) dialog: We're going to sell a million units in the first 90 days, 20,000 a month after that. STEVE looks at her for a moment and then smiles...
57) 26) dialog: Yeah.
57) 28) dialog: What’s more, 32% of the sales are going to go to people buying a computer for the first time and 12% are going to people using some kind of Windows machine--that's what Bill Gates has against you--and it’ll be the fastest selling computer in history. (MORE )
57) 31) dialog: You brought the company back from life support after going through the misery of laying off 3,000 people and cutting 70% of the product line so Steven...it’s over...you’re going to win. It would be criminal not to enjoy this moment.
57) 33) dialog: Make things alright with Lisa.
57) 35) dialog: Come on.
57) 37) dialog: Does being a multi-billionaire take some of the sting off that?
57) 39) dialog: All Lisa (did)--
57) 41) dialog: And Lisa could have done what? File a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development? How’s Lisa supposed to stop her mother from selling her own house?

57) 59) dialog: What's been wrong with me for 19 years?! I’ve been a witness and I tell you I’ve been complicit. I love you, Steven, you know how much. I love that you don’t care how much money a person makes, you care what they make. But what you make isn’t supposed to be the best part of you. When you’re a father, that's what’s supposed to be the best part of you and it’s caused me two decades of agony, Steve, that it is, for you, the worst. It isa little thing, a very small thing, it’s not a big deal, fix it, fix it now or you can contact me at my new job working anywhere I want.
57) 61) dialog: No.

57) 78) dialog: I know that too.

57) 83) dialog: It’s that you told her you weren’t going to pay for Harvard. That child--that earnest, unironic kid--

57) 87) dialog: Andy told me that.

59) 83) dialog: What the hell is going on? woz Nothing. Thanks for your time.
59) 84) dialog: (to STEVE) It’s done. She’s coming back. STEVE nods...then turns back to WOZ--

60) 5) dialog: Would you like me to demonstrate your capacity to be wrong when you're certain you’re right?
60) 7) dialog: Do you remember the cover?
60) 9) dialog: Yes.
60) 11) dialog: What was it? 102 STEVE JOBS -—
