1) 40) dialog: No, so the rates are off and it keeps crashing.
1) 51) dialog: Part of the problem is--
1) 53) dialog: We can recompile but if it’s a hardware problem we can’t get into the back.
1) 55) dialog: (to STEVE) You want to tell her or should I?
1) 58) dialog: (to JOANNA) You need special tools.
1) 61) dialog: He didn’t want users to be able to open it, you need special tools.
1) 64) dialog: In fairness, not many of them were issued the tools.

19) 11) dialog: Name my other choices please.
19) 23) dialog: Yeah.
19) 25) dialog: The clock’s gonna read whatever the time is, it’s a clock. STEVE takes a moment, nods, and turns to go head to where he’s supposed to wait backstage. He sees a welcoming sight--the first one of the day. It’s JOHN SCULLEY. SCULLEY’s a handsome and easygoing man abou years older than Steve. He’s got a bottle of wine and two glasses.

29) 10) dialog: It’s got email. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 95.
29) 13) dialog: And I assume an email sent on a NeXT computer can only be received by a NeXT computer?
29) 19) dialog: (to STEVE) Can I talk to you a second?
29) 21) dialog: Look, man, Avie’s been recompiling but he says there may be some glitches this morning.
29) 24) dialog: I didn’t want him to find out the hard way your position on glitches in a demo but it sounds like you’ve mellowed.
29) 26) dialog: I wouldn’t have ever dreamed that was a problem.
29) 28) dialog: And how ‘bout Lisa? Getting into a school for gifted kids?
29) 30) dialog: Seriously, it’s a big deal.
29) 32) dialog: I’m sure that’s not why she got in.

29) 39) dialog: It’s Guy Kawasaki writing in MacWorld, you’re gonna like this.
29) 41) dialog: He wrote a parody press release about Apple buying NexT for your OS. He imagines a near-future where Apple needs your OS and has to buy NeXT and you come back as CEO. He has Gates saying there would now be more innovations from Jobs that Microsoft could copy. You can read it later.
29) 43) dialog: She would have gotten in without you donating a building. (beat) She's a very bright girl, Steve.
29) 45) dialog: Alright, good luck. ANDY exits backstage to head out into the house...

57) 118) dialog: Steve--
57) 120) dialog: Yes.
57) 123) dialog: I don’t think they look that carefully, I don’t think they'd notice the check didn’t come from you.
57) 125) dialog: I understand how--
57) 127) dialog: I understand how you feel and I do apologize, I do, but let me tell you my thinking.
57) 129) dialog: I knew you guys would fix things, you always do, but in the meantime if the money wasn’t there she'd miss a semester of school.
57) 131) dialog: And she'd have to tell her friends why. And she needed things, she needed socks.

57) 159) dialog: Chrisann is my friend.
57) 161) dialog: (pause) You mean--
57) 164) dialog: I don’t remember. We were talking and I said--it was pretty much what I just said, that it certainly couldn’t hurt.
57) 166) dialog: (pause) I did. (pause) I think it’s a miracle she’s not robbing banks with the Symbionese Liberation Army. There is no reason in the world why she should be nice. But she is. So I helped. Because somebody had to.
57) 168) dialog: You threatened me a long time ago.
57) 170) dialog: A long time ago. You threatened me once.
57) 172) dialog: (pause) I meant you literally threatened me. At Flint, right before the Mac launch. (MORE )
