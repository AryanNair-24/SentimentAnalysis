1) 3) dialog: It absolutely is gonna say “Hello.”
1) 5) dialog: (over) You built the voice demo.
1) 11) dialog: It worked last night, it worked the night before that, it worked three hours ago.
1) 13) dialog: (over) Fuck you.
1) 16) dialog: We need it to say “Hello.”
1) 18) dialog: (over) Fix it.
1) 20) dialog: Yeah. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 3.
1) 23) dialog: Fix it.
1) 25) dialog: Who’s the person who can?
1) 27) dialog: How bad are you saying?
1) 29) dialog: I don’t know what that means.
1) 32) dialog: I don’t care if--who’s Joel Pforzheimer?
1) 34) dialog: Alright.
1) 37) dialog: (to ANDY) Alright, what are your guys saying?
1) 39) dialog: Is the synthesizer sampling fast enough?
1) 42) dialog: We can’t cut it.
1) 44) dialog: (over) Two days ago we ran a Super Bowl ad that could’ve won the Oscar for Best Short Film. (MORE )
1) 45) text: STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 5.
1) 47) dialog: There are more people who can tell you about the ad than can tell you who won the game.
1) 50) dialog: (calling back to ANDREA) Don’t open the house. (to the house) We're taking a quick break.
1) 52) dialog: --what?
1) 56) dialog: (to ANDY) Don't start with me, man.
1) 63) dialog: There are a hundred engineers walking around here, none of them have the tools?
1) 65) dialog: What about you? ANDY shrugs--
1) 68) dialog: No.
1) 70) dialog: It’s not gonna crash.
1) 72) dialog: (calling out to the house) Andy!
1) 74) dialog: The other Andy, you’re right there, why would I (be calling out into--) STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 7.
1) 78) dialog: (to ANDREA) The exit signs have to be off or we're not gonna get a full blackout.
1) 80) dialog: And?
1) 82) dialog: I‘1ll pay whatever the fine is.
1) 84) dialog: You explained to the fire marshal that we’re in here changing the world?
1) 87) dialog: If a fire causes a stampede to the unmarked exits it will have been well worth it for those who survive. For those who don’t, less so but still pretty good. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 8.
1) 90) dialog: (still to ANDREA) I need it to go to black, real black, get rid of the exit signs and don’t let me know how you did it. (to ANDY) Fix the voice demo. STEVE leaves the stage, followed by JOANNA and heads--
2) 2) dialog: You knew it was a closed system.
2) 5) dialog: It’s not for no reason. We blow this and IBM will own the next 50 years like a Batman villain. Remember the phone company? (MORE )
2) 6) text: STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15
2) 8) dialog: That’s what Bell was called, the phone company. IBM will be the computer company and in 10 years they'll be the information company and that’s very bad for the human race so we don’t have time to be polite or realistic ‘cause if we are, this company’s next product launch will be held in front of 26 people and a stringer from the Alameda County Shopper's Guide.
2) 10) dialog: Okay, pull the voice demo.
2) 12) dialog: And then cancel the launch.
2) 14) dialog: (over) You can tell me how unimportant it is but if the computer doesn’t say hello then neither will John Sculley who, I promise you, agrees with me.
2) 16) dialog: He’s also not a hack and when it comes to the Macintosh he’s gonna do what I ask him to do. What is in this box? STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 10.
2) 19) dialog: (pause) What the fuck is--why is there a carton of--who did this?
2) 21) dialog: Who?
2) 23) dialog: This isn’t a Macintosh.
2) 25) dialog: Somebody thought it would be a good idea to, like, enthusiastically hand over copies of Time with a not- a-Macintosh on the cover at the launch of the Macintosh? What are they handing out at Hewlett- Packard, a bushel of apples with my face on them?
2) 27) dialog: Yeah? STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15
2) 30) dialog: What I'd like you to do with them is to take them, all 2600 copies, and stack them on Kottke’s desk and tell him Steve says, “Happy New Year to you.”
2) 32) dialog: I gave Michael Moritz full access, the whole campus. Bandley, Apple II, Lisa, I gave him Sculley, Markkula, I gave him Woz, I gave him everybody. Betrayal, thy name is Michael Moritz and Bozo, thy name is Daniel Kottke. What should I call the person who thought it would be a good idea to hand these out?
2) 34) dialog: Like what?
2) 36) dialog: Joanna-—
2) 38) dialog: Look--
2) 41) dialog: Those are the forecasts.
2) 43) dialog: I’m fanning (expectations).
2) 45) dialog: Everyone, everyone, everyone. Everyone is waiting for the Mac.
2) 48) dialog: --which is what supports menus, windows, point and click, high res graphics--—
2) 50) dialog: Coach lands on the runway at the exact same time as first class.
2) 53) dialog: Okay--
2) 55) dialog: Who’s gonna want a PC once--what idiot is gonna want--if I need to tell you there’s a spot on your shirt I point to the spot, I don’t say there’s a spot 14 centimeters down from the collar and 3 centimeters to the right of the second button while I try to remember what the command is for club soda, that’s not how a person’s mind works.
2) 57) dialog: You can complain about memory or you can complain about price but you can’t do both at the same time. Memory is what costs money. And I’m glad you're telling me your feelings about the Mac now because we have a half-hour left, we can redesign it.
2) 59) dialog: (over) Look at their faces when they see what it is. They won’t know what they’re looking at or why they like it but they’1l know they want it.
2) 62) dialog: “Rite of Spring" happens to be the most revolutionary and provocative symphony of the last century.
2) 64) dialog: It was 1913, there weren’t--I don’t know why we’re talking about Stravinsky when-- (holding up Time) --I've been properly sodomized by Dan Kottke in Time magazine.
2) 66) dialog: By talking to Moritz about it?
2) 68) dialog: What does that mean?
2) 70) dialog: (pause) Except, Joanna, except--I don't have a daughter named Lisa! (beat--picking up the magazine) And this story is now about how I’m denying paternity and took a blood test! (MORE )
2) 73) dialog: And that’s why there’s a picture of a--I don’t know what the fuck that is--that’'s why there’s a picture of a PC on the cover instead of a picture of me and the Mac. (beat) I don’t know what to tell you. I was supposed to be Time magazine's Man of the Year and then Dan Kottke was born.
2) 75) dialog: What.
2) 77) dialog: Who?
2) 79) dialog: Brennan?
2) 81) dialog: How did she get in?
2) 83) dialog: I’m not having a session with her right now.
2) 86) dialog: (pause) Lemme get this over with. But don’t leave, you’re gonna stay here.
2) 88) dialog: No, there’s less chance of a scene if you stay here, she’1ll be cool.
2) 90) dialog: I don’t want to be in a room alone with Chrisann. Come on, this is me and you.
3) 1) dialog: Hey.
3) 3) dialog: This is a surprise, why don’t you come on in.
3) 5) dialog: (to LISA) You coming too?
3) 8) dialog: Okay. It’s a safe hallway, but...anyway-- They walk back into-- INT. STEVE’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
3) 9) dialog: --you remember Joanna Hoffman, she’s the head of marketing for the Mac.
3) 16) dialog: Well we’re a little pressed for time, so--
3) 18) dialog: Why?...do you want to leave when (you just said)-- 17. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15
3) 22) dialog: (to JOANNA) Thank you.
3) 24) dialog: I'm not your-- STEVE stops himself and sees the looks coming from both CHRISANN and JOANNA.
3) 25) dialog: (pause) That, actually--do you know what a coincidence is, Lisa? Like if you met someone, if you made a new friend and her name was Lisa too, that would be a coincidence. Lisa stands for “Local Integrated System Architecture”. L-I-S-A. It’s a coincidence.
3) 27) dialog: Yeah.
3) 32) dialog: Nothing was named after anybody, it’s a coincidence.
3) 35) dialog: What’s the matter with you?! Why are you telling her these things? Why are you still telling her I’m her father?
3) 37) dialog: No he didn’t.
3) 39) dialog: That’s not remote--
3) 41) dialog: That‘s not remotely what I said.
3) 43) dialog: First of all, can I tell you something about Time magazine? (MORE )
3) 46) dialog: I believe it’s a training facility for paid assassins.
3) 48) dialog: I didn’t invent math.
3) 50) dialog: I wasn’t saying you've slept with 28% of American men, I was using an algorithm based on the blood test which said there was a 94.1% chance that I’m the father.
3) 52) dialog: Believe me, I’m not trying to publicly do anything with you.
3) 54) dialog: (over) It would've been more if they’d put me on the cover but Dan Kottke (decided to kidney punch me and--)
3) 56) dialog: I'm sorry?
3) 59) dialog: Well...I feel like Apple stock is being dramatically undervalued. This would be a good time to get in.
3) 61) dialog: Chrisann--
3) 63) dialog: She’s not my daughter.
3) 65) dialog: No.
3) 68) dialog: (to CHRISANN) Excuse me. STEVE steps out into--
4) 0) text: --where ANDY HERTZFELD is waiting along with some members his team. LISA slips into the dressing room from the hall without STEVE much noticing. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 22.
4) 2) dialog: We're there?
4) 7) dialog: You guys caught up now?
4) 10) dialog: We're there?
4) 12) dialog: Goddammit ! It should be noted there are a number of people--YOUNG ENGINEERS--standing around and witnessing Steve beat up A
4) 14) dialog: You didn’t have seconds, you had three weeks. The universe was created in a third of that time.
4) 17) dialog: Here’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to announce the names of everyone who designed the launch demo--I’m gonna introduce everyone and ask them to stand up. The bag was designed by Susan Kare, the Macintosh font that’s scrolling across the screen was designed by Steve Capps, the starry night and the skywriting was Bruce Horn, MacPaint, MacWrite, Alice, down to the calculator and then I’m going to say the voice demo that didn’t work was designed by Andy Hertzfeld. ANDY laughs a little for a moment but STEVE stares at him ANDY realizes he’s serious. The others are looking down a trying to make themselves look busy but there’s no saving Andy here.
4) 19) dialog: Five in six is your chance of surviving first round of Russian roulette and you’ve reversed those odds so unless you want to be disgraced in front of your friends, family, colleagues, stockholders and the press, I wouldn’t stand here arguing, I'd go try to get some more bullets out of the gun. (beat) Do it, Andy. ANDY nods to his team that they should come with him and back to work. As the team starts to walk away, STEVE sees of the engineers take a diskette out of his shirt pocket a light bulb goes off in his head.
4) 20) dialog: Stop. You. What size shirt do you wear?
4) 23) dialog: What size--does anyone know what size shirt he wears? Does anyone know what size shirt I wear?
4) 25) dialog: The disk fits in your pocket--I need a shirt with a breast pocket, I can take it out on stage.
4) 27) dialog: The disk! (to JOANNA) I need a white shirt in my size with a breast pocket.
4) 29) dialog: Go out in the lobby, find someone my size who’s wearing a white shirt and tell them I’1l trade them for a free computer and they get to keep my shirt.
4) 31) dialog: No, the Mac is beige, I'm beige, the disk is blue and the shirt has to be white. Andy? STEVE looks at ANDY and mimes rolling the cartridge of a revolver and sticking it to his own head along with sound effects. ANDY and his team take off as STEVE heads back i STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 25. INT. STEVE’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 7
4) 33) dialog: Yeah. CHRISANN points to the Mac that’s sitting on a table--
4) 35) dialog: That’s it.
4) 37) dialog: I know.
4) 39) dialog: (for Chrisann’s benefit) Lisa, how old are you now?
4) 41) dialog: (over) How old are you, Lisa?
4) 43) dialog: Come sit here for a minute. You know what this is? LISA sits at the table in front of the Mac--
4) 46) dialog: It’s a computer. Can I borrow your hand for a second? STEVE puts his hand on top of LISA’s and demonstrates the mouse.
4) 47) dialog: Point that arrow...and click. You don’t have to but if you want you can play with it. Nothing you can do will break it so just do whatever you want with it.
4) 49) dialog: I’m paying you exactly what the court ordered me to pay you.
4) 51) dialog: I’m not the one who decided on that amount.
4) 53) dialog: She’s not--
4) 55) dialog: (pause) I’m proud to say that Apple donates free computers to underfunded schools and we'll be doing more of-- STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 27.
4) 58) dialog: Apple donates millions of dollars worth of computers to schools.
4) 60) dialog: (over) Imagine an underprivileged kid who has their favorite teacher with them 24 hours. We’re minutes away from being able to do that.
4) 62) dialog: Tell me the question again.
4) 64) dialog: No let me explain what happened, ‘cause I have plenty of time right now. There’s a knock on the door and ANDREA opens it--
4) 68) dialog: (to CHRISANN) Hang on. STEVE goes out into--
5) 1) dialog: Thanks--you too. woz Big morning.
5) 2) dialog: Yeah. woz You should see the crowd outside. It’s like...the crowd is like, you know... STEVE waits patiently until he can’t anymore--
5) 3) dialog: (pause) I can’t really wait for you to come up with the metaphor, man. woz Yeah so listen, I wanted to ask you a favor.
5) 4) dialog: Yeah. woz Can you acknowledge the Apple II team in your remarks?
5) 5) dialog: (pause) I can not. woz Just an acknowledgement, have them stand up. 28. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 29.
5) 7) dialog: We’re launching the Mac. woz It'd be a morale booster. Just a mention so they can get a round of applause.
5) 8) dialog: Woz-- Woz Just a mention.
5) 9) dialog: Can we stick a pin in this for a minute-- woz Sure, yeah.
5) 10) dialog: Thanks. woz I’m just talking about an acknowledgement for the team.
5) 11) dialog: I’ve got Chrisann in there, I'll see you in just a second. woz Sure. STEVE goes back into-- INT. STEVE’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
5) 12) dialog: (to CHRISANN) I didn’t take the DNA test voluntarily, I took it because the board was worried you were going to sue me.
5) 14) dialog: The board. Was worried you were going to sue me before the IPO. (MORE )
5) 15) text: STEVE JOBS -—
5) 17) dialog: The members of the board, individually, believe that you're deranged, Chris. They were worried that you were going to sue me before the IPO and endanger the stock price. Fourteen of the greatest minds in business were literally weighing the possibility that you could affect the economy. So I took a blood test, which I obviously wouldn’t have done if I didn’t think it would prove conclusively and for all time that I am not-- (he mouths--“her father”.) --and frankly I think telling her otherwise is child abuse.
5) 19) dialog: (over) The test didn’t prove (anything).
5) 21) dialog: Would you like to be put ina casket and buried if there’s a 94.1% chance that you’re dead?
5) 26) dialog: (without having to look at it) That.
5) 28) dialog: You asked me what people are going to do with it. They’re gonna do that. There’s a KNOCK on the door and JOANNA enters with a whit shirt.
5) 30) dialog: Thank you. STEVE starts to take off his shirt...
5) 32) dialog: Sorry? Then STEVE looks at Lisa’s painting which he hadn’t seen he turned it around for Chrisann...he’s seeing it for the first time and he almost involuntarily stops unbuttoning shirt.
5) 35) dialog: (pause) You used MacPaint. STEVE keeps looking at the screen, then glancing at Lisa.
5) 36) dialog: Push that key and the ”“S” at the same time. LISA does as she’s told as the “SAVE” box comes up.
5) 37) dialog: Now type your name. She does. “L-I-S-A B-R-E-N-N-A-N.”
5) 38) dialog: Do you know which box says “Save”? LISA points to the right box.
5) 39) dialog: Right. Go ahead and click on it. She does. After a moment, STEVE continues changing his shirt...
5) 40) dialog: (pause--then to CHRISANN) I‘1l1 put some money in your account. And I’1ll buy you a new house, someplace near a decent school.
5) 43) dialog: I know.
5) 46) dialog: (to CHRISANN) We're done?
5) 51) dialog: Bye, Lisa.
5) 54) dialog: I do like your painting. But LISA didn’t hear him--she’s already out the door.
5) 55) dialog: (calling after her) Lisa?
5) 59) dialog: It’s a school day. She needs to be in school. (beat) I’m gonna give you whatever you need.

5) 81) dialog: (over--he means this) I heard what you said, Joanna. We're about to do this thing--at 9:41 the planet’s gonna shift on its axis, nigh and forever. The two most significant events of the 20th Century--the Allies win the War and this. This. So maybe right now isn’t the very best time to scold me for not being a better father to a kid who’s not my kid. The test--

17) 3) dialog: PARC stands for Palo Alto Research Center--Xerox PARC. In the ‘70s they came up with something called “Gooey”--G-U-I--Graphical User Interface. Instead of typing commands they used the metaphor of a desktop and roughly the same idea as a McDonald’s cash register. You press a button with a picture of a cheeseburger. STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 03/19/15 47.

It’s warm and it’s playful and inviting and it needs to say hello. It needs to say hello because it can. We hear a few dozen members of the audience--seated up in balcony--start to stamp their feet and clap their hands i rhythm, rock concert style. The few dozen turn into a few hundred. STEVE, JOANNA and ANDY silently take it in...

19) 29) dialog: It’s nine in the morning.
19) 31) dialog: It was a bad idea to have Markkula open with quarterly reports. Instead of having Markkula open we could have just dropped water on the audience. SCULLEY laughs a little--
19) 32) dialog: You know, just big 10,000 gallon tanks of cold water dropped from the ceiling, save Mike some money on index cards.
19) 34) dialog: Why?
19) 37) dialog: You’re the only person who sees the world the same way I do.

19) 41) dialog: The board--
19) 43) dialog: Only because you see to it they are.
19) 45) dialog: I want you to push ‘em out all at once. Through a window if it’s the nearest exit. The looks on their faces when we showed ‘em the spot?
19) 47) dialog: Some of them were frozen like they’d just seen “Springtime for Hitler."
19) 50) dialog: Yesterday, the day after it airs-- once--the publisher of Ad Week calls it the best commercial of all time. Of all time. And it is and if anyone ever does one better it’s gonna be Chiat/Day who the board wanted to replace and it’s gonna be Lee Clow who the board thought was out of his mind. Now listen to this, you ready? The “1984” ad starts playing on the screen--we’re seeing from behind--and as soon as it starts the CROWD ROARS.

19) 54) dialog: Yeah.

19) 58) dialog: They had a look he wanted.
19) 60) dialog: Yeah.
19) 63) dialog: Which ones?
19) 65) dialog: My point is they didn’t get it.
19) 67) dialog: They didn’t get it, they didn’t like it, they tried to pull it, they were wrong, we were right and that boardroom is a big bowl of scares-the-living-shit-outta-me.
19) 69) dialog: Who else knows what?

Stanford’s annual budget’s 750 million dollars and growing. The University of Michigan- -over a billion dollars and growing. Ohio State, Cal, Colorado, UCLA, Georgia Tech--these are Fortune 500 companies disguised as George? STEVE’s calling out to GEORGE COATES, the creative direct of the presentation.

21) 14) dialog: I like the circus, I love the circus, but why does it still look like that?

22) 13) dialog: Yes.
22) 15) dialog: They're suing me.
22) 17) dialog: They're not being magnanimous, they want it to look like an amicable divorce. History doesn’t remember Joe DiMaggio kindly for dumping Marilyn. JOANNA makes a suppressed but loud sound while shutting h eyes and shaking her fists at God.

22) 79) dialog: Did you hear what I just said?

22) 83) dialog: Is there something you need?
22) 87) dialog: You've asked me before.
22) 89) dialog: It’s an optical anomaly. To the human eye a perfect cube doesn’t look like a cube so we made it roughly a millimeter shorter than a foot on two sides.

We stay on W backstage for a moment, who now understands that Steve's version of wiping the slate clean and his are two differe things. GEORGE COATES calls from out in the house--
23) 17) dialog: Good. Where do you want to pick it up?
23) 19) dialog: A word that’s sometimes used to describe me--
23) 21) dialog: We've got about 10 minutes before we have to clear the house.
23) 23) dialog: I promise you we are.
23) 26) dialog: We make computers, we’re--I’ve had this conversation before--we'’re starting on time. The giant screen behind Steve is showing the NexT desktop STEVE demonstrates the thesaurus feature.
23) 28) dialog: A word that’s sometimes used to describe me is “mercurial.”
23) 30) dialog: Let's look at the dictionary definitions. (scrolling to it) “Of or relating to or born under the planet Mercury.” (scrolling down) I think the third one is what they mean. STEVE glances offstage where he sees that LISA is now watching a few feet from WOZ.
23) 31) dialog: “Characterized by unpredictable changeableness of mood.”
23) 33) dialog: If we scroll down the thesaurus, though, we see the antonym is “saturnine.” By simply double- clicking on it we immediately look that up in the dictionary and here it is: “Cold and steady in moods. Slow to act or change. Of a gloomy or surly disposition.”
23) 36) dialog: So I don’t think “mercurial” is so bad after all.
23) 38) dialog: Gimme just a second. STEVE walks to the wings--
23) 39) dialog: (to LISA) It’s against the law for you not to be in school.
23) 41) dialog: Where is she? STEVE leads LISA and WOZ back into--
24) 2) dialog: Do you remember asking me that the night before last when you were having dinner at my house?
24) 4) dialog: The word that was the opposite of mercurial was bad, which meant mercurial was good.
24) 6) dialog: I think you do get it.
24) 9) dialog: ‘Cause we also talked about it when you came to the rehearsal last week.
24) 11) dialog: The angles?
24) 13) dialog: The angles are straight.
24) 15) dialog: Why does it feel like you’re working me?
24) 17) dialog: Woz? Why aren’t the angles straight on other things? woz (to LISA) When the manufacturers make things with 90 degree angles, they cheat the angle a little bit--89, 91--so that it’s easier to get the object out of the mold. Like getting a cake out of a pan. But on your dad's new computer he insisted the angles be exactly 90 degrees.
24) 21) dialog: Some people don’t mean cool when they use that word. woz (to LISA) I did. STEVE opens the door to -- 36 INT. STEVE’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 36 --where CHRISANN is waiting.

You had a college and university advisory board telling you they need a powerful workstation for 2 to 3 thousand, you've priced NexT at 6500, which doesn’t include the optional three thousand-dollar hard drive which people will discover isn’t optional because the optical disk is too weak to do anything and the twenty five hundred dollar laser printer brings the total to twelve-thousand dollars and in the entire world, you are the only person who cares that it’s housed in a perfect cube. You're gonna get killed and I came here to stand next to you while that happens because that’s what friends do, that’s what men do, I don't need your pass.
