67) 18) dialog: Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although... (she's really warming up to her subject now)

It's expanse of white walls devoid of mouldings, a blank plaster canvas. city views are great, the apartment identical to hundreds other cookie cutter condos. Several young artists are working on a neo-classical mural on the long side of the living room. They are colorfully dressed, listening to a TALKING HEADS tape while they work. A carpenter who looks like a member of Duran Duran is installing a pair of old columns from Urban Archaeology on either side of the entrance to the living room while another fits a brass si into an antique sideboard which has been turned into a ba

She rests her head on a hand stenci velvet Venetian throw pillow, looking like a Pre-Raphaeli madonna. A terracotta pot with a spray of white phaleonop graces the coffee table. As the sun sets over the canyons highrises, Bud walks around his new home totally in awe. This apartment, perfect in its restrained taste with all "correct" flowers and objects, has nothing to do with him Perhaps he can understand the state-of-the-art kitchen, t computerized telephone, stereo and light system, but he needs a set of instructions just to be able to switch on David Letterman. This apartment is Darien's fantasy, and Bud is merely the incidental client who paid for it. Most importantly to he it is ready to be photographed by House and Garden.
95) 3) dialog: I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
95) 5) dialog: Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...

107) 11) dialog: You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...

126) 16) dialog: That if you make an enemy of Gordon Gekko, I won't be there to stand by you. Bud is stunned...and hurt.
126) 18) text: What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
126) 19) dialog: You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
126) 22) dialog: Fair enough...but it's not that simple, Bud. When I was down and had nothing, it was Gordon who helped me. He got me all my clients -- you among them... (snaps her fingers)
126) 26) dialog: You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...

135) 19) dialog: Because I don't want to see him hurt.
135) 22) dialog: I can't...and I won't.
135) 24) dialog: Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
135) 26) dialog: You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
135) 28) dialog: I know...but maybe, just maybe Gordon, I'm good enough so I don't need you anymore. She walks away.
