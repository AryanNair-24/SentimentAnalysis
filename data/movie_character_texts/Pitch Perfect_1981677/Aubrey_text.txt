30) 33) dialog: I can see your toner through those jeans.
30) 35) dialog: (to Chloe) We better have our shit together for SBT.

36) 13) dialog: Well if you can’t, then someone else needs to step up and solo.
36) 16) dialog: You too, what?
36) 19) dialog: She'd never want to.
36) 21) dialog: That’s not how we do things here.
36) 23) dialog: Aca-what?! (to Beca) You will be singing “Turn the Beat Around” and that’s the last I want to hear of this.
36) 27) dialog: Let me explain this to you because you still don’t seem to understand. Our goal is to get back to the finals. These songs will get us there. So excuse me if I don’t take advice from some alt girl with her Mad Lib beats when she’s never even been in a competition. Have I made myself clear?

49) 3) dialog: This isn’t the Beca show!
49) 5) dialog: It’s not up to you to decide what we do and when we do it. Why don’t you ask the rest of the group how they felt about your little improvisation? The gang shuffles awkwardly for a beat, saying nothing.
49) 10) dialog: A lot by surprise. (to Chloe) I told you she wasn’t a Bella.
