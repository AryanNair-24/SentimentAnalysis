24) 6) dialog: It's too many. Drive, Zoe. A Reaver craft ROARS over their heads. It's nearly the si of Serenity. Torn apart, belching smoke -- a welded conglomeration of ruined ships, painted for war. Predator pure. It disappears over the rooftops.
24) 14) dialog: Drive! Zoe's face is set with unhappy determination as she floor it, shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust. As they move from him, four Reavers jump out of the shado and grab the young man. Mal unhesitatingly draws his gun. He nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops bac Mal fires twice. The young man takes both bullets in the chest, slumps down dead.

39) 4) dialog: I had to shoot him. What the Reavers woulda done to him before they killed him...
39) 12) dialog: We couldn't take the weight. Woulda slowed us down.
39) 14) dialog: Mule won't run with five. I shoulda dumped the girl? Or you? Or Jayne? (CONSIDERING)
39) 17) dialog: And go to Fanty and Mingo with air in our mitts, tell 'em "here's your share"? They'd set the dogs on us in the space of a twitch, and there we are back in mortal peril. We get a job, we gotta vo make good. Washenters from the bridge.
39) 19) dialog: Maybe that's why we lost. She's not happy with the reply. Mal climbs down to his ro as Wash reaches Zoe, slides his arms around her.
40) 0) text: Once alone, Mal lets his own disappointment show. He pull off his holster and drops it over a chair. Kicks the toil closed and sits on his bunk. The place resembles a submarine cabin, with charts and clutter, ancient maps on the walls.

ANGLE: THE CORVUE CAMERA'S POV of the men is conveniently blocked by her little dance. Mal's foot nudges a duffel bag of money to Mingo's foot.
47) 52) dialog: Yeah, they're a fine bunch of ruebens.
47) 55) dialog: So I'm noticing. Is there a problem I don't know of? You got 25% of a sweet take kissing your foot, how come we're not dispersing?
47) 61) text: You're unlikable, Mal. You got no respect for us above you, you got enemies in every quadrant, and your ship's older than the starting point of time. You's charity cases to such as us.
47) 67) dialog: Well here's a foul thought. I conjured you two were incompetent; sent us out not knowing there were V0 Reavers about. Now I'm thinking you picked us out because you did.

Cables and chai run along the ceiling, around a series of ladder rungs.

There is a railin here or Mal would go over as well -- but he comes back wi a couple of hammer blows, gets the Operative off him. They square off, Mal stumbling back into a tool chest, knocking over tools and computer parts. The Operative reaches behind him and pulls his sword gracefully from the holster under his jacket. Mal produces his weapon: a tiny screwdriver. He hurls a toolbox at the Operative and rushes him, gets inside sword range and tries for the neck with the screwdriver -- the Operative blocks it and works the swor point against the edge of Mal's stomach. Starts pushing slowly, despite Mal's resistance, and breaks skin.
