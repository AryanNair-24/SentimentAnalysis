5) 47) dialog: It's come to our attention that River became much more unstable, more... disturbed, after you showed her off to Parliament. Did she see something very terrible in those cards?
5) 49) dialog: But they are in her. Her mind is unquiet. It's the will of the Parliament that I kill her. And the brother. Because of your sin.
5) 56) dialog: (continuing; moving to his briefcase) You know, in certain older civilized cultures, when men failed as entirely as you have, they would throw themselves on their swords.
5) 58) dialog: The Parliament has no further interest in psychics. They represent a threat to the harmony and stability of our Alliance.

He slices the throat of the one behind h with true grace, thrusting at the second as he's pulling his gun and pinning his hand. A moment, and the dying age reflexively squeezes the trigger, shooting his own arm. The Operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as quietly as the first. Mathias bolts but the Operative pins him to the wall. He bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the Doctor's spi Mathias stiffens, suddenly, agonizingly immobile. The Operative steps back, observes the Doctor's rigid gri for a moment. Almost ceremoniously, he drops to one knee holds the blade out to one side, hilt to the floor and po tilted toward the doctor.

I can speak a word and send a missile to that exact location inside of three minutes. Mal pulls a small device, clipped wires sticking out all around it, and tosses it to the Operative.

80) 68) dialog: I am of course wearing full body armor. I'm not a moron. He tosses Mal hard against a wall, spinning and blocking blow from Inara -- she is clearly trained in martial arts but he flat-heels her to the ground within seconds. Mal is going for his gun again, turning, and the Operativ kicks him in the face, sends him back, gun flying. Mal ge to his feet and they square off. Mal breathing hard, nose dripping blood. The Operative perfectly poised, waiting.

They square off, Mal stumbling back into a tool chest, knocking over tools and computer parts. The Operative reaches behind him and pulls his sword gracefully from the holster under his jacket. Mal produces his weapon: a tiny screwdriver. He hurls a toolbox at the Operative and rushes him, gets inside sword range and tries for the neck with the screwdriver -- the Operative blocks it and works the swor point against the edge of Mal's stomach.
