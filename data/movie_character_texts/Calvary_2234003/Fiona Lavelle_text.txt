13) 26) dialog: So you say.
13) 28) dialog: What was the subject?

23) 1) dialog: I should buy a cane.

23) 5) dialog: I could lean on it. Reflectively.
23) 7) dialog: Club someone to death with it.
23) 9) dialog: A certain young man from Rathmines. He glances at her. She is looking at the ground as she walks.
23) 10) dialog: Aren't all instruments blunt?
23) 19) dialog: Lovely creature.
23) 22) dialog: Is that right?
23) 24) dialog: God, you're a fucking prick--
24) 0) text: LAVELLE and FIONA are walking along the deserted beach. The waves rolling in. Bruno noses at something in the sand. They pause, look down --

27) 0) text: FIONA raises the hem of her skirt to her thighs and steps down into the cool clear water. Bruno watching her. She paddles out to where LAVELLE is standing in waders, fly-fishing, the skirt of his soutane floating out over the water.

27) 3) dialog: Maybe I should take it up.
27) 5) dialog: I’m assuming you mean professionally rather than-—

The remains of a picnic close by. Bruno sleeping. Behind them, a massive Ice Age boulder, split in two, in the middle of a field.
34) 2) dialog: Ages. Eons. He nods. Glances round at the split-rock.
34) 5) dialog: They were up the top of the Ox Mountains. Cicsatéin challenged Fionn to throw a boulder into the sea at Easkey, claiming he couldn’t do it. Fionn accepted the challenge. Cicsatéin’s boulder landed on the Easkey shore, where it created such waves that the sea hasn't been the same since, which is why the Easkey coastline is internationally renowned for surfing. Fionn’s boulder fell short and landed here. Fionn drew his sword and split the rock in two. It's said that should anyone be foolhardy enough to pass through the rock three times, the two halves will come together and they will be squashed into tiny little lumps. Unceremoniously.

41) 27) dialog: You think what happened was un- important. Insignificant in the great scheme of things. To provoke such a reaction. But what may mean nothing to you may be very important to me.
41) 29) dialog: That’s irrelevant. Every moment of living has its own logic.
41) 31) dialog: I belong to myself, not to anybody else.
41) 33) dialog: Funny, in the old days it was the priests who'd tell you you were sick. Now it’s the psychiatrists. (pause) You know Freud had cancer of the gums at the end of his life. The smell from his mouth was so bad even his own dog wouldn't go near him. He asked his doctor, an old friend of his, to give him an overdose of morphine. Which he did.
41) 35) dialog: (after a pause) The absurdity of existence versus the absurdity of nothing. (CONTINUED)
41) 39) dialog: You'll tell me it would’ve been a mortal sin, I suppose. Would I have suffered eternal damnation, Father?
44) 19) dialog: Fine-looking man.
44) 21) dialog: Oh I gave up the cocaine a long time ago.
44) 23) dialog: How about a dance? Or what did * they call it in your day, a jive? *

51) 8) dialog: (after a pause) What was Stanton was getting at?
51) 10) dialog: I thought I was the one supposed to be in trouble, not you. They look at each other.
51) 19) dialog: What are you expecting him to do about it now?
51) 24) dialog: He has as much right as anyone else--
51) 28) dialog: Oh you bitch. LAVELLE looks at VERONICA with utter disgust. She notices this, and smiles.
51) 37) dialog: Do you have to put up with that kind of shit on a regular basis? Through the window we can see VERONICA as she reappears and throws her arms around ASAMOAH. ASAMOAH looks blankly at LAVELLE and FIONA.

52) 2) dialog: Like in one of those shit plays at the Abbey?
52) 4) dialog: Neither do I. (CONTINUED)
52) 8) dialog: It was a long goodbye if ever there was one. I sometimes wish she hadn't hung on as long as she did.
52) 10) dialog: It wasn’t just her dying. You were missing in action a long time. Before and after. When I needed you the most.
52) 12) dialog: I don’t know, maybe I’m exaggerating. You were a highly-functioning alcoholic, I'll give you that.
52) 19) dialog: What’s that you're wearing?
53) 0) text: LAVELLE and FIONA manoeuvre between the rock-pools.
53) 2) dialog: There are other forms of violence.

53) 8) dialog: I love you, too. Don’t doubt that. They look at each other. Put their arms around each other and walk on.
53) 9) dialog: And just when I thought I had you back and you were all ship-shape and raring to go, go you did. I thought it’d be another woman.
53) 11) dialog: I know that. I know you're sincere. But the fact remains, first she went away and then you went away. I lost two parents for the price of one. (CONTINUED)
53) 15) dialog: I think you’re being a little naive, there, Father. They stop as they reach the edge of the rock-face, lookin out over the sea.
53) 17) dialog: Will you? (with a sad smile) You promise?
53) 20) dialog: It's corny. But I like it.

68) 1) dialog: y'know, you changed the subject, the other day when we were talking.
69) 5) dialog: You know what the subject was. I think you committed a sin of omission there, if truth be told.
69) 7) dialog: Well now you'd be the expert in that department, Father.
69) 9) dialog: I suppose I will.
69) 11) dialog: You might be right. What would be your number one?
69) 13) dialog: (after a pause) I forgive you. Do you forgive me?
