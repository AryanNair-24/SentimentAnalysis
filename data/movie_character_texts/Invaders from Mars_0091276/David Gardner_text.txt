The room is dome-like in structure, and an area twelve feet in diameter and approximately eight feet in height occupies the apex of the dome, which is of a transparent plastic substance.  This is the control tower of the space ship.  A bank of control panels is placed in this structure and a round, cushioned pilot's seat is suspended on a crosswalk of perforated metal girders.  The room is illuminated by a series of circu- lar lights which look like portholes.  Even so, the lighting is in comparative low key.  The two mutants descend a spiral staircase and bring Pat and David to the center of the room and lay their unconscious bodies on the floor.  Then they step back approximately five feet and assume a rigid attitude grotesquely reminiscent of soldiers.
