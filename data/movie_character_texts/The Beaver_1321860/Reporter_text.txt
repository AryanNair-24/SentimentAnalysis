100) 1) dialog: Christmas in... May? That’s what some retailers are calling it with Mr. Beaver Woodchopper kits selling out in numbers that remind many of the Tickle Me Elmo phenomenon. Davyco, the company behind Mr. Beaver says they’re doing all they can to keep pace with demand, but admits there have been shortages. interestingly, you may recall that Davyco, which had earlier success with 90's fads Action Jack and Princess Stephanie, lost its founder and CEO Davy Conyers ina highly publicized restaurant choking incident while in the company of a paid escort and since then the company has been in steep decline, hovering on the verge of bankruptcy earlier this year. But thanks to Mr. Beaver, it looks like that won’t be happening anytime soon.
