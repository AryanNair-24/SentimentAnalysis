When I finally decided that I had to write the thing myself I thought I suddenly had this great insight that was going to knock everyone's socks off.

139) 19) dialog: He was always something I was trying to separate myself from, not get closer to. And by the time I realized how stupid that was, he wasn’t around. So I didn’t become this overachieving valedictorian to bring him back. I did it because every time I did something he'd done, every time someone looked at me and saw a little bit of my brother, it felt like we were getting closer. Like I was finally getting to know him, even though he was gone. But the flip side is that after eighteen years I feel like I know my dead brother a lot better than I know myself.
