3) 35) text: Frank continues to mutter apologies as he walks gingerly around Cara and boards the train.

5) 3) text: Frank looks vaguely out of place, sitting by the window in his casual jeans and pullover sweater. He's wrapped up in a dog-eared paperback spy novel. So wrapped up that he barely notices Cara sit down opposite him.

7) 37) dialog: No travel insurance. No refund on the tickets. So... here I am. On my honeymoon.
7) 41) dialog: I really loved that pizza too. "Bala Pizza" if you're ever in Rosemont.
7) 48) dialog: Thanks.
7) 49) text: The waiter rolls his eyes and leaves them.    Cara seems amused by Frank's obliviousness.
7) 51) dialog: What takes you to Venice?
7) 60) dialog: Okay... you'd be a diplomatic attachГ© or... let's see... a girl from East Germany whose father's been kidnapped by Soviet agents. They're blackmailing you into stealing... probably a microchip. There's usually a microchip involved.
7) 64) dialog: Trouble, certainly.
7) 68) dialog: No doubt. You'll probably be shot at in less than two chapters.
7) 76) dialog: Maybe.
16) 1) text: Frank's eyes drift open. He glances out the window and as his vision comes into focus he sees that the train is stopped. He sits bolt upright.

19) 3) text: CAMERA CONTINUES PAST HER TO REVEAL Frank, clutching the railing beside her, afraid to wake up.
20) 1) text: Frank leads us through the distinctive, revolving glass door into the low-ceilinged entrance lobby.
20) 9) text: She nods at Frank. For a second, the receptionist cannot keep the surprise out of his eyes. This glamorous, superbly dressed creature is married to a dull, American tourist in a T-shirt?
20) 18) text: He gives her a large gold key and nods to a porter to take the luggage. Frank hurries to catch up with her.
21) 2) text: Frank and Cara trail the porter across the marble floor.

23) 4) text: Frank opens his mouth to answer.    Then laughs.
23) 6) dialog: What's not to like?
23) 10) dialog: I can see that.
23) 13) text: Frank looks at her for a beat, barely able to breathe.
23) 18) dialog: No, no, no. The sofa's fine. Perfect in fact.
23) 23) dialog: I'll get it.
24) 1) text: Frank walks across to the door. There is a small spyhole and he looks through it. The porter stands there with a trolley. Frank opens the door.

25) 3) dialog: I've put my things in the other bathroom.
30) 3) text: Cara and Frank walk on a deserted patch of sand.   The wind wraps her light sun dress around her body, intermittently hugging her perfect curves.

30) 12) dialog: You're good at it.
30) 17) dialog: I'm not really into weddings at this particular moment in my life...

31) 16) dialog: Well... (quietly)
31) 26) dialog: He doesn't sound like much of a friend.
31) 31) text: Frank glances at her wrist.
31) 33) dialog: So why are you wearing his watch?
31) 37) text: She runs her fingertip over the face of the watch. Then, impulsively unclasps it and reaches for Frank's hand.
31) 40) text: She puts it on Frank's wrist, over his protests.
31) 42) dialog: What? No, I can't. This thing must be worth a fortune--
31) 48) dialog: I'll wear it until you regain your senses.
31) 52) dialog: What?
31) 57) text: LONG SHOT of Frank and Cara framed by the sunset. A romantic dinner for two. They could easily be lovers or honeymooners...
32) 1) text: The key sounds in the lock and the door swings open. Frank and Cara tumble in together, laughing, a little tipsy.
32) 4) text: Frank bypasses the sofa-bed and follows her outside.
33) 2) text: Frank appears beside her.
33) 4) dialog: I could get used to this.

37) 11) dialog: When she...?

46) 101) text: Frank stands and half-heartedly follows him to the doorway.
46) 103) text: An idea comes into Frank's head... he looks around. Nobod is watching him. He glances at the inscription on the WATCH...

66) 2) text: Frank places a plate before Cara who sits with her wine at Pearce's oak table. She looks appreciatively at her plate.

81) 3) dialog: Is he worth it?

81) 15) dialog: He doesn't deserve it.
81) 28) text: He glances back up at Frank and whistles appreciatively. Frank turns and goes back inside.
83) 1) text: Paging through the cookbook, Frank locates the page. He smiles in recognition at the familiar CODE pattern of red dots. He pulls out a PEN...

84) 2) text: Getting out of the shower, Frank enjoys the soft Frette towels.

92) 56) text: Frank turns back to Cara, who calls out--
92) 60) dialog: (contradicting her)
92) 66) dialog: Not particularly, but I'm tired of being afraid. I've been running around like a frightened mouse long enough and I've decided I'm finished.
92) 67) text: Frank pulls out a Gitane cigarette.   He lights it, smoking while he talks.
92) 71) dialog: When I first saw the name I got scared: "Alexander Pearce." He even sounds like some super cool master criminal with Russian enemies and the beautiful girlfriend... he probably works out. He might own a pizza shop on the side for all I know.

92) 74) dialog: These are disgusting.
93) 2) text: ON THE MONITOR - Frank is settled in opposite Cara.

94) 11) text: Frank works himself up, drawing courage from his anger.
94) 13) dialog: Well I'm not playing the role anymore. I'm going to confront him. He's supposed to meet you here, isn't he? I'm going to tell him exactly what I think of him.
94) 17) text: Frank leans in.
94) 19) dialog: What's the lure, Cara? Obviously not his character. Is it the money? The luxury? What's any of that worth if you're getting shot at and you could go to jail?
94) 23) dialog: He's smooth, right? He probably has mistresses in every European city, too.
94) 40) dialog: What the hell?
94) 41) text: As Frank looks up.
94) 44) text: Then FRANK steps in front of The Undercover Waiter, mistaking him for Pearce.
94) 46) dialog: Is this him?
95) 7) text: The Undercover Waiter tries to move past Frank.
95) 9) dialog: You hide out poolside and send your girlfriend and a total stranger to face the murderers who are after you? Not much of a tough guy, are you?
95) 10) text: Frank SHOVES him back.
95) 14) dialog: Where I come from, we don't treat women like that!

97) 1) text: Frank brushes past tables, hits the street and RUNS down the Palazzo, toward Cara.

97) 7) text: Frank runs to the edge of the water as it motors away.
97) 12) text: Frank looks at the two big men on either side of him. Then at Cara disappearing over the water. The fight drains out of him and he doesn't resist.

98) 40) text: Frank stares at him blankly...
98) 42) dialog: How...?

99) 29) text: Frank grows angry.

99) 37) dialog: Then I'll go to the press. I'll tell the entire story to the New York Times.

106) 46) dialog: You shouldn't worry about me. What about you?
106) 50) dialog: What are you going to do?

108) 5) dialog: You all read the same newspaper.
108) 8) text: Frank nods. Ackerman sits down next to Frank as if he were an old pal instead of a quasi-captive.
108) 13) dialog: I look forward to meeting him.

114) 48) text: ON FRANK -- concerned.

124) 1) text: SNIPER'S POV - Demidov and his gun-wielding henchmen standing over Frank and Cara.
125) 2) text: Everything explodes in a mass of blood and glass. SCARFACE is blown off his feet. His body hits the ground next to Frank... his gun skitters across the floor.

125) 12) text: Frank remains on top of Cara, shielding her until long after everything has fallen silent.

127) 38) text: Frank crawls across the room and presses a hidden latch on a built-in bookshelf. It swings out of the way to reveal a hidden safe built into the floor.

128) 4) text: Cara leans on Frank's arm as she heads for the exit.
