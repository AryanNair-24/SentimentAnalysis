1) 4) dialog: No. No, I suppose not. (looks down) According to this, I’m in Nevada. ON THE GROUND: the RED LINE runs right between them. On t west side of the line, stenciled letters read “California On the east side of the line, “Nevada.”
1) 8) dialog: Not bad. Looks like it might rain. What’s California like? Darlene looks over her shoulder to the west.
1) 10) dialog: Can I give you a hand there?
2) 3) dialog: How are you enjoying Nevada so far? Darlene shrugs. So far, so good.
2) 14) dialog: Daniel Flynn. It is nice to meet you.
2) 16) dialog: The Immaculate Heart of Mary’s in Bloomington, Indiana. A beat as Laramie sizes up Flynn.
2) 18) dialog: I'm sorry?
2) 20) dialog: Her... name is Barbara.
2) 24) dialog: I confess my memory is not what it used to be. But I have it written down in my valise. I'd be happy to get it for you once I check-in and am squared away.
2) 44) dialog: Oh. (turns) “Darlene.” Darlene nods. Smiles. (CONTINUED)
2) 56) dialog: Do I know you, son?
2) 60) dialog: “Miles,” is it? If this is not a place for a priest, Miles, then this is exactly where the Lord wants me.
2) 64) dialog: It’s all right, son.
2) 67) dialog: What’s the difference?
2) 69) dialog: Between the rooms.
2) 80) dialog: May I see a map of the hotel? Miles nods. He pulls out A MAP. From above, the El Royale looks like an upside-down “U” with the parking lot in the middle. As Father Flynn looks it over --
2) 91) dialog: I‘1l take Room Four. Miles looks away from the window. Gets a key from the wal behind him. Laramie moves closer to the window for a better look. IN CAR: we can make out A WOMAN in the driver’s seat. She se to be watching the road behind her intently.
2) 109) dialog: Can I give you a hand to your room?
9) 1) text: Dwight starts walking down the hall. Passes ANOTHER OBSERVATION WINDOW. The room’s dark. Dwight squints. Seems empty. Dwight keeps moving. We track with him. Watc him STOP SHORT when he gets to the next window. Room Four. As Dwight stares, we angle around to reveal: FATHER DANIE FLYNN. Unaware that he’s being watched, Father Flynn's bu shoving his twin bed up against the wall. He reaches into his valise, pulls out what looks like A CROWBAR and A HAM He goes to the corner of the room... And starts yanking the carpet free of the tacks. Dwight stares. The corridor eerily silent as the priest works. Father Flynn yanks an entire swath of the carpet free, exposing the old wood boards underneath. Flynn takes the crowbar... and starts hammering it into t floorboards. Dwight can’t believe what he’s seeing. What the hell is t old priest doing? Dwight watches in silence for a second. Then turns his attention back towards THAT CAMERA. Keeps moving. But sto in his tracks yet again when he passes... Room Five. Darlene Sweet’s room. And, yes, there she is... Also doing something strange. She's standing on her dresser, trying to hang what looks a large swath of fabric on her west wall. She has thumbta in her mouth, she uses them to secure the fabric in place She hops off the dresser. Grabs another roll. Goes back t work hanging it on the wall. (CONTINUED )

13) 8) dialog: It’s no bother. Quite the opposite, actually. It’s lovely.
13) 10) dialog: What was that you were singing? Did you write that?
13) 14) dialog: Your brothers wrote that?
13) 16) dialog: Oh. (sorry) I don’t know much about the radio these days.
13) 18) dialog: I’m gonna go find some food. In the lounge. I thought I’d see if you want to join? With this place, there’s probably strength in numbers.
13) 20) dialog: You sure? On me. You can consider it payment for earlier. For letting me listen to you sing.
14) 1) dialog: Why even have a bell?
14) 5) dialog: I handle food, you handle entertainment?
14) 10) dialog: (thinks ) I’m aware there is a group called The Four Tops. But that’s about as much as I got.
14) 16) dialog: I think you’re better at your job than I am at mine. Darlene walks over. Sees the vending carousels of food. Sandwiches, fruit, pastries. Everything looks gray.
14) 18) dialog: How lucky are you feeling tonight?
14) 20) dialog: Pie?
14) 23) dialog: (shrugs) My knowledge of what’s going on ends somewhere in the fifties. (MORE ) (CONTINUED )

14) 39) dialog: You sure? Nothing like whiskey on a cold night.
14) 42) dialog: That's where you're from? Georgia?

14) 46) dialog: That's exciting.
14) 48) dialog: Why are you staying here? (CONTINUED )
14) 53) dialog: Why do it at all? Darlene hesitates. Sadness in her eyes. She shrugs. I don't know...
14) 56) dialog: I was up in Oakland. Visiting my brother. Making my way back to Indiana. Had to get off the road before dark. My eyes are bad at night. (then) Ritz-Carlton was booked. So here we are.
14) 58) dialog: (nods ) About that.
14) 60) dialog: We used to be. about it. Drinks. FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D) We used to be. (then) (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
14) 64) dialog: (smiles ) We can make allowances for that, if need be. But... (then) When I said my memory wasn’t what it used to be... I may have been understating things a tad. (drinks ) For the last few years, I’ve been having problems with my recall. And I don’t think it’s just my age. (then) I’m certain it’s not just age. “But how can they control you, Bernadette? When they cann control themselves, Bernadette?” FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D) I wake up some days, and I can’t remember who I am. I have moments where I lose time... when you saw me in the parking lot, today, actually. I had completely forgotten where I was. What I was doing. It’s the strangest feeling. You look around and you’re someone else. And you don’t know who that is.
14) 66) dialog: I did. (smiles ) He agrees with my assessment that it’s not just age.
14) 71) dialog: I wasn’t looking for pity. Might be for the best, in fact. Some parts of my life aren’t worth remembering. No, I’m just telling you because, if I seem scattered... I don’t mean offense. She pats his hand.
14) 73) dialog: I could use another. He stands up. Makes his way back to the bar. She gets up, too. Carries their dirty plates over to the bar. FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D) Sure I can’t tempt you? My memory may be spotty, but I do recall it’s a sin to let an old priest drink alone.
14) 75) dialog: Grand. Darlene walks back over to the jukebox. CLOSE SHOTS: Flynn pours two drinks. Flynn glances up at Darlene. Confirms she’s not looking a him. She’s lost in the music. And in this moment, as he stares at Darlene, Father Flynn face changes. The kindly old priest disappears. And is replaced by a different man. A much harder man. (CONTINUED)
14) 80) dialog: I'd like that. HOLD ON FLYNN. His face drifts again. As though he’s forgotten, once again, where he is. Or. Perhaps he’s having second thoughts about what he’s about do. He repeats the words to himself, as though he’s realizing he really means them: FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D) (quietly) I'd like that. But. Then. His face hardens with resolve. He picks up the glasses. He turns around... FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D) But until then -- And Darlene bashes him in the face with a wine bottle.
24) 4) dialog: I’m not your father. (CONTINUED )
24) 8) dialog: What’s this song?
24) 10) dialog: What happened?
24) 12) dialog: Where's... where’s... (then) Was I alone?
24) 14) dialog: (thinks; then) No. Flynn gets to his feet. But as he takes a step, his knees get weak. He manages to slide into the banquet. FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D) Kid... what’s your name again?
24) 16) dialog: Miles. I need a drink. (then) Fix me a drink. (CONTINUED )
24) 20) dialog: Just one drink. To clear my head. I'd do it myself, but... (gestures to mess) Look what happens. Miles hesitates. Unsure. FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D) I fell down, Miles. I’m old. Shit happens. Get the whiskey. Miles heads towards the bar. Flynn sits in the banquet an listens to the music. He catches a glimpse of himself in reflections on the wall. Sees the priest collar.
24) 24) dialog: Not right now, kid. (CONTINUED )
24) 28) dialog: So's everybody. You'll be fine. Flynn finishes the drink. Stands. Takes a few steps. He’s got his sea legs back. FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D) You got a master key to this place?
24) 30) dialog: (nods ) Like I said, kid, I’m old. CLOSE SHOT: the drawer slides open, revealing the room ke
24) 34) dialog: Where’s the key? Miles shakes his head. Walks towards THE CORRIDOR. (CONTINUED )
25) 1) dialog: You watched me? His eyes flash. He grabs Miles by the throat. Slams him u against the wall. Miles cries out in pain.
25) 2) dialog: What did you see?
25) 4) dialog: Who's “they?”
25) 8) dialog: What do you do with the film?
25) 10) dialog: You ever keep any of the film? Miles doesn’t respond.
25) 11) dialog: Miles.
25) 13) dialog: But_you kept the film? Miles doesn’t say anything. Tears start to well in his ey
25) 15) dialog: Miles...? But something catches their attention. Light flickers, shadows move on the wall across from Room Seven. Miles steps forward. And stops right in his tracks. Flynn joins him. And we angle around to reveal: Rose. Bound and gagged. Right up close to the window. (CONTINUED )

25) 23) dialog: Miles. Listen to me. (then) The Lord wants you to tell me where the film is.
27) 3) dialog: Kid -- GET AWAY FROM THE WINDOW! KA-BOOM! The window EXPLODES in the shotgun blast. Miles disappears in a storm of BUCKSHOT and GLASS. Flynn jumps, slams on the brakes. Watches in horror as Mi hits the ground. HOLD ON FLYNN. Staring at the hole where the window used be. He looks down at Miles. (CONTINUED )
36) 2) dialog: I just want to talk. Can I get in? Darlene thinks about it for a moment.
36) 6) dialog: I believe you. He doesn’t wait for further invitation. He opens the door Sits down in the passenger seat slowwwwwwly. He rolls up the window. He wipes the rain from his forehead. He stares at the hotel. FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D) Well. (then) We're in a bit of a pickle here. Darlene just stares at him. Tries to keep the gun from shaking as she points it right at him. FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D) I’m sorry I tried to drug you back there in the lobby. (then) I wasn’t trying to diddle you or nothing like that. I just needed to break into your room and I didn’t want to hurt you. More than need be, I mean. (then) No hard feelings about bashing me in the head, is what I’m saying. Flynn stares at the hotel. Thinks. FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D) I'm pretty sure those girls just killed a cop of some sort.
36) 8) dialog: You saw it? Darlene nods. FATHER FLYNN (CONT’D) That his gun? She nods again. Flynn thinks. (CONTINUED )
37) 0) text: SAME FRAMING. CLOSE ON the man we know as Father Flynn. A least, we think that’s him... it’s hard to know for sure beneath that BLACK HAT and MASK he’s wearing. We should probably start calling this man by his real name now:
