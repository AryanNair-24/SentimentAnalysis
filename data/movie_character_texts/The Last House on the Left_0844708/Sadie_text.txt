17) 59) dialog: I don’t.
17) 64) dialog: What do you wanna do, Krug? A beat. Krug stares at Mari in intense, unreadable silence for a moment. Mari swallows nervously as Paige looks ill and Justin looks worried.

24) 29) dialog: You’‘d think she might protest, but instead, she seems oddly captivated, bordering on turned on by what Krug is doing to Mari.

30) 14) dialog: Thank you, Emma. 57. Sadie looks around at the kitchen in awe.
30) 15) dialog: This is a really beautiful kitchen. Everything’s so white and squeaky clean. Emma‘s a little weirded out by Sadie’s childlike leering.
30) 24) dialog: That’s putting it mildly. Emma finishes stirring the hot chocolate.
30) 43) dialog: You sure that’s a good idea, Krug? Krug pauses. Glares at Sadie, pissed at her questioning him --

CU - SADIE - eyes closed as the water flows down her scarred face... 72. WITH KRUG - in the bedroom. He sets the silenced gun on the night stand, pulls his shirt off.
