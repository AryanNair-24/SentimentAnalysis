She then peers back into the sink, wide-eyed as she takes in the sight of Mari‘s necklace -- neatly encircling the red mug. Unbelieving, Emma picks it up.

58) 14) dialog: That rain letting up any?
58) 16) dialog: Glasses. Right. Sorry. Emma goes to the fridge and smoothly slides the photo off the door and slips it in her jeans pocket just as Francis turns and approaches. Emma goes up on her tiptoes, opens the cabinet above the fridge, pulls out two wine glasses.
