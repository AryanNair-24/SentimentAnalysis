He presses up against a tree, then slinks to the ground -- and turns away. cU - MARI - Her eyes stream with tears as Krug -- O.S. -- thrusts at her from behind, savagely... Sadie watches. Wide-eyed.

30) 28) dialog: Owfuck.

58) 1) dialog: Hey there. Emma YELPS in surprise and spins around to see Francis standing just ten feet from her. FRANCIS (CONT’D) Sorry, sorry, I thought you heard me come in. I saw the fire still going. Figured you were both night owls. Emma smiles weakly.

58) 6) dialog: Well, what is gonna cut it, Mrs. Collingwood?
58) 8) dialog: Adult beverage, huh? We fall into that category? Francis moves closer, eyeing Emma’s cleavage beneath her button down blouse.
58) 10) dialog: Then I guess you’re my bartender. Maybe a little Jack Daniels --
58) 12) dialog: Guess I am tonight.
58) 15) dialog: Ah, it’s not that bad out there anymore. Emma turns and freezes in surprise as she sees that Francis has come closer to stand right in front of her. Emma flinches a little as Francis reaches past her. He leisurely picks up the knife from the counter. FRANCIS (CONT’D) I think the storm’s finally on its way out. Francis slides the knife back into its empty place in the knife-holder and smiles at Emma innocently. A beat. FRANCIS (CONT’D) Do I get a glass or do you want me to chug it straight from the bottle?
58) 18) dialog: (smiling) Thanks. Francis suddenly pauses -- FRANCIS (CONT’D) Now all we need’s -- Francis suddenly stops short -- seeing something 0.8. FRANCIS’S POV - peering through the living room and sliding glass door to Mari lying on the hot tub on the back porch. 83.
