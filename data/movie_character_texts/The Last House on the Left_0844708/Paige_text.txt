13) 2) dialog: Mari Collingwood! Mari spins around to see PAIGE, 17, a stunning beauty, even when wearing the required uniform of the ice cream shop she’s leaning out of: neon pink apron, black slacks, polo shirt.
13) 5) dialog: I know, right? Like two years?
13) 7) dialog: Like the hair?
13) 9) dialog: Tell me inside, c’mon --
13) 11) dialog: Oh. Well, yeah you’re right, I do have to draw up a report on the quarterly “crazy cone” sales and get it to New York in time for the annual stock holders meeting.
13) 13) dialog: Mari?
13) 15) dialog: Get in the damn store.
14) 0) text: Mari and Paige sit at the table by the window. Mari takes a final lick of her mint-chocolate chip that sits atop a squiggly-shaped waffle cone a.k.a. the crazy cone. Mari considers it.

14) 6) dialog: God, he just had eye surgery, everything’s detached, so he’s got the bandage, the black patch... he’s a mess, but you gotta love him. 20. Mari smiles. A beat. Then --
14) 7) dialog: (delicately) Listen, Mari, I was so -- I couldn’t believe it when I heard about your brother --
14) 9) dialog: I’m so sorry for not getting in touch. I’m so bad about that stuff, I just --
14) 11) dialog: Hey, I don’t have a special place in my heart for this hole. I’m outta here, first chance I get.
14) 13) dialog: It does if you can do it. So you should come over tonight. My dad‘s at my aunt’s till tomorrow. (with a mischievous smirk) Got the whole place to mine own self, oh yeahhh... Mari’s cell phone RINGS.
14) 15) dialog: There is this semi-mysterious pretty good looking unabomber wannabe dude walking on the sidewalk over there. Mari turns -- sees the guy meandering along --
14) 17) dialog: (shaking a “no”; faux western accent) He ain’t from these here parts.
14) 19) dialog: True, but you also didn’t cover the same fifty-foot stretch of concrete twelve times in five minutes. We’re definitely being surveilled or -- is that the right word, “surveilled?”
14) 21) dialog: Excuse me, sir? The guy looks over. PAIGE (CONT’D) Yes, you, sir. Would you like to try a crazy cone? Mari watches the guy. He pauses. PAIGE (CONT’D) On the house. You don’t like it, I’ll give you your money back. The guy breaks a smile. Mari eyes him closely as he crosses the street.
15) 0) text: Our unabomber guy has now joined Paige and Mari at the table. Call him JUSTIN. His hood pulled back now... 15, messy hair, spotty teenage stubble... He jams the rest of the crazy cone in his mouth.
15) 1) dialog: So Justin? (off his nod) Where do you hail from?
15) 3) dialog: You’re a long ways from home, cowboy. (amused, to Mari) I always wanted to say that -- (back to Justin) You just move here or something?
15) 5) dialog: And who’s we? 23.
15) 7) dialog: What’s up with that? Your parents divorced or something? Justin shakes his head, staring at the ground.
15) 9) dialog: So they get turns with you? I did that with my parents for awhile. It sucks monkey nuts. What did your mom -- Justin looks up, meeting Paige’s eyes for the first time.
15) 11) dialog: Alright, this is gonna sound tacky and awful, but... I’ve had enough death for one day... (to Mari) No offense.
15) 14) dialog: So let’s start over. I’m Paige and this is Mari with an “i” not the more traditional “y.”
15) 17) dialog: So where are you staying on your pass through town, Justin? Justin gestures up the road.
15) 19) dialog: Meadowlark.
15) 21) dialog: Did Bridgette cut you a deal?
15) 23) dialog: Well, I’‘11 call her and kick her ass til she does.
15) 25) dialog: So have you smoked any good shit lately, Justin?
15) 27) dialog: What? I’m sorry, did that offend you, Justin?
15) 30) dialog: Well, Mari, I know it’s not PC these days, but in all candor, he just fits the profile. Mari can’t believe it, puts her hand to her forehead. Justin, on the other hand, breaks an amused smile and a little chuckle. 25. PAIGE (CONT’D) Now he’s laughing. Even better. Why are you laughing, Justin?
15) 32) dialog: Damn right I do, and look what that gung-ho shit’s gotten me. Five eighty-five an hour, three black polos and a pink apron. Two more months I get bumped up to green. Now Mari’s laughing.
15) 34) dialog: Say again, sweetie?
15) 36) dialog: Yeah? What else could it get me?
15) 38) dialog: That a fact. What about the rest of your posse? Would they approve?
15) 40) dialog: Well, we don’t really need a lot.
15) 42) dialog: (getting up) Then I guess it’s closing time. Saddle up, Mari, you’re driving.
15) 44) dialog: Then just give us a quick lift there. It’s two minutes. Justin and me’1ll race in, get the stuff and get out. You can keep the car running. off Mari -- not liking this a bit -- but relenting...
16) 0) text: Mari‘s SUV is the only car parked in the circular drive of this run-down lodge. Paige and Justin hop out amidst stronger gusts of wind and a distant ROLL of thunder.
16) 1) dialog: (to Mari through window) Two minutes.
16) 3) dialog: Which one?
17) 0) text: ...-where we reveal Justin and Paige sitting on the bed, smoking a j.-
17) 2) dialog: Mari, Justin wasn’t bullshitting. This is some premium shit. 28.
17) 4) dialog: No, Mari -- Mari turns back.
17) 6) dialog: No, screw that, we’re going. We’re going -- where’s my purse --
17) 11) dialog: (to Mari, still not seeing Krug et al) You‘1ll give me a ride home still, right?
17) 39) dialog: We only smoked half of one -- we can pay you.
17) 45) dialog: Jesus Christ...
17) 60) dialog: Well, you should. We don’t care. We don’t give a shit, really --
17) 62) dialog: But I swear we won’t -- 33.
17) 70) dialog: So we can leave now? You can just take the car and we're not gonna say anything --
17) 72) dialog: What --
18) 0) text: Paige heads for the small window next to the shower. Hands shaking as she tries to lift it. But this thing hasn’t been opened in years.
18) 1) dialog: 
18) 4) dialog: Cell phone pressed to her ear, using her other hand to force the dry-rotted window open a couple of inches, still SCREAMING as
21) 0) text: The SUV SWERVES as Mari and Paige SCREAM -- Mari’s now trying to push the back door OPEN!
23) 0) text: The SUV SCREECHES across the pavement and tumbles off the road into the woods -- INSIDE THE SUV - Blood-curdling SCREAMS as it rolls end over end, down the incline -- MARI falls back inside the SUV as -- WHAM! It SMASHES into a tree, miraculously UPRIGHT. Silence. No movement. A long beat as steam HISSES from the busted engine. Quiet. Bordering on peaceful even -- until finally -- One of the back doors opens and Paige falls out onto the ground. She looks up, blinking and dazed, but unhurt. She rises unsteadily to her feet - BAM! Krug KNOCKS HER DOWN - She looks up in fear as he towers over her angrily -- IN THE SUV’S PASSENGER SEAT - a foggy-looking Justin rubs his head, his deflated airbag deployed. A back-door opens and Francis groggily emerges, moaning. His nose has been broken and it’s a bloody mess. Krug sees it, cringes -- 40.
23) 3) dialog: (horrified) No! Sadie emerges from the SUV, a hand held to the small, red burn-mark on her face.
23) 15) text: Paige glances over her shoulder in terror, sees Francis gaining on her and Sadie not far behind him -- She whimpers in fear and pushes herself even harder -- Paige disappears from his vision as the terrain dips and she heads down a hill. She stumbles down the steep incline, leaping over logs, obstacles... suddenly TRIPS on a rock, CRIES OUT as she sprains her ankle, FALLING forward, now TUMBLING and ROLLING down the hill toward
23) 17) dialog: (screaming)
23) 21) dialog: Fuck you! SMACK! Paige SLAMS the rock against the side of Sadie’s head, knocking her away. Paige quickly stumbles to her feet, whirls around only to come face to face with Francis --
24) 0) text: Paige, her wrists tied with pieces of her now shredded shirt, is thrown to the ground next to Mari. Krug is still glaring, just as we left him, intense uncertainty raging in his eyes. Sadie and Francis stare at him expectantly. Justin stands in the b.g. Too terrified to move as
24) 1) dialog: sit on the ground at their feet, passive in their traumatized state.
24) 7) dialog: You’‘re pathetic. Krug turns to look down at Paige in surprise. She stares back at him with cold eyes, her tears gone now, a strange confidence on her face. She doesn’t care anymore.
24) 10) dialog: I said you’re pathetic. Krug steps forward, gets in her face, stares at her in silence as Paige smiles, her anger building. PAIGE (CONT’D) What? You gonna hit me? Go ahead. Hit me, you piece of shit. 45. Krug GLARES another tense beat. Then... a smile creeps across his face. He chuckles.
24) 14) dialog: No -- Mari -- don’t --
24) 16) dialog: -- Don’t -- don’t say it, Mari -- Mari forces the tears back --
26) 0) text: Krug, Francis, and Sadie make their way back up to the crashed SUV. Justin’s still sitting against the tree staring at Paige’s body.
