CU - SADIE - eyes closed as the water flows down her scarred face... 72. WITH KRUG - in the bedroom. He sets the silenced gun on the night stand, pulls his shirt off. Collapses to the bed, his legs and feet hanging off the side, just above MARI‘’S DUFFEL BAG stuffed underneath. Krug looks over through the bedroom doorway into the living room, sees Justin’s silhouetted form lying on the pull-out bed.

John eyes the dark, partially-open doorway leading to the bedroom and looks at Emma. WNods to the chest of drawers. Emma tip toes over to the chest, slides the drawers open anxiously looking for the boat keys. She turns to John, shakes her head -- they’re not here. John swallows and quietly moves to the door. Carefully reaches out and eases it open --

Take it easy, kid -- easy -- cU - JUSTIN - his hand trembling -- tears streaming down his face -- he snivels -- then -- he suddenly turns the gun around and extends his arm further toward John and Emma. And they realize -- He wants them to take the gun. John nods to Justin. Then carefully steps forward across the creaking hardwood floor that’s only partially muted by the thunder and downpour. John keeps walking, warily keeping his eyes on Justin. CREAK. He steps on another loose FLOORBOARD. John freezes as Krug GROANS and shifts in bed. Emma tenses from the doorway... Krug stays asleep. Relieved, John keeps going, closing in on the gun as Justin quietly stays in his place. John reaches out -- and gently takes it out of Justin’s outstretched hand. A beat of eyes on terrified eyes. Justin then looks away as John turns to the bed and raises the gun, aiming it point blank at Sadie just as a BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes just outside. The CRASH of thunder wakes Sadie and Krug up.
