23) 57) dialog: I hope you don't come to regret sparing his life. He's quite a good shot. The Colonel just watches Caesar a beat; beneath the chill stillness of his eyes we sense something dangerous, damag
23) 58) dialog: Have you finally come to save your apes?
23) 63) dialog: I see... I kill somebody close to you that night...? Caesar looks him right in the eye, unblinking...

23) 68) dialog: (a cryptic beat) Joining me...?

The APES' CHANTING SUDDENLY FALTERS as -- Caesar WINCES -- but he refuses to break eye-contact with Colonel, who stares back, a battle of wills... The Colonel nods; and Red LASHES Caesar again! Spirits broken, the apes go SILENT; beside Caesar, Ape El drops his eyes. Red looks to the Colonel, lowering his switch -- but the Colonel's eyes remain fixed on Caesar's, the two leaders staring at each other, neither giving in... And then the Colonel NODS to Red again. Surprised, Red hesitates -- then, LASHES Caesar once more, the CRACK ech through the silent camp. The Colonel coldly nods again; e Red is shaken by the Colonel's relentlessness.

26) 26) dialog: Three...   Two... And suddenly an APE by the wall quickly reaches out and p up one of the boulders, desperate to save Caesar's life - It's LAKE. The Colonel pauses at the sight, gun still raised... Caesar turns to see her, surprised... And then ANOTHER APE picks up a boulder. Then another...

27) 5) text: Give them food and water... or they will not be able to finish. The Colonel looks up, amused by Caesar's audacity.
27) 6) dialog: You know you're very emotional. (then) What makes you think you're in a position to make demands? Caesar doesn't reply. The Colonel turns back to the map - Preacher nervously tugs again on Caesar's chain --
27) 13) dialog: I was told you were smart, but... that's impressive. He stares at Caesar a moment; then finally:
27) 14) dialog: No.   They won't be joining me.
27) 16) dialog: They... fear me.
27) 20) dialog: Jesus Christ... you are impressive. (then, almost enjoying this)

27) 29) text: (low, with contempt) Mercy. Do you have any idea what your mercy would do to us? Caesar stares warily, confused by the simmering rage he s to have provoked in the Colonel. THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
27) 30) text: You're much stronger than we are. And you're smart as hell. No matter what you say, you'd eventually replace us, that's the law of Nature. The irony is, we created you. We tried to defy Nature, bend it to our will. And Nature's been punishing us for our arrogance ever since. Testing us. Even now. Caesar searches the Colonel's ominous expression...     T THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
27) 35) text: And if it spread, it would destroy humanity for good this time. Not by killing us... but by robbing us of the things that make us human. Our speech, our higher thinking...

27) 36) text: Well, it was a moment of clarity for me. I realized I would have to sacrifice my only son, so that humanity could be saved. I held that gun in my hand, and I pointed it at my only child. (emotion in his eyes as he remembers) He looked at me with trust in his eyes, all he had left in his primitive gaze. And I pulled the trigger. It purified me. It made my purpose clear. His eyes finally return to Caesar's, who looks stunned. THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
27) 43) text: (a beat, quietly) You severed their heads, sir. THE COLONEL
27) 44) text: Except for the one I spared, so he could return to deliver a message: if they wanted to relieve me of my command, they'd have to meet me here, and do it themselves. Caesar stares, his eyes questioning what the Colonel mean THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
27) 45) text: This place used to be a weapons depot. They turned it into a relocation camp when the crisis was just beginning. But the weapons are all still here, inside that mountain. (a beat) This is a holy war. All of human history has led to this moment. And if we lose, we'll be the last of our kind. It will be a planet of apes. And we'll become your cattle. Caesar just stares, unsettled; they hold each other's eye THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
27) 47) text: How many... will be coming? THE COLONEL
27) 48) text: Probably all of them. Don't get any ideas -- only thing they fear more than me is you apes. They never questioned my methods when it came to you. He moves closer, looking at Caesar's face, his tone quiet THE COLONEL (CONT'D)

Preacher watches as The Colonel steps forward, venturing closer to Caesar, seemingly unconcerned for his safety... PREACHER
27) 58) text: ...sir -- The Colonel holds up his hand to silence Preacher as he s right in front of Caesar again, eye to eye... Caesar burn tortured by the agonizing effort to restrain his rage... THE COLONEL
27) 59) text: What do you think my men would've done to your apes... if you had killed me? Caesar looks up at the Colonel. The Colonel holds Caesar' angry stare as he starts slowly forward:
27) 63) text: Or is killing me more important...? The Colonel lingers tauntingly... finally, he turns to Preacher -- and as Preacher and Red move in, we --
27) 70) text: He was right, you do think he's sick, don't you? You're just like them. He's not crazy. The world's gone crazy. And he's the only one with the vision to get us through this. The Colonel's a great man. He sacrificed everything for us. You can't judge him. Who are you to judge him? (darkening) I was trying to give you a heads up, keep you out of his way, I don't even know why. But if you think you and I have some kind of relationship -- that you're gonna give me, what, advice? You can disavow yourself of that notion right fucking now. Caesar is stunned.    Preacher raises his crossbow:
32) 28) dialog: If he's still alive in the morning, he goes back to work or you shoot him. (then) Keep him separate from the others.
34) 23) dialog: How many are out there?   Are there others? Rocket stays silent, refusing to show even a hint of fear
34) 24) dialog: (to Soldiers) Sweep the area. (turns to Red) Put him in the pen. As the Colonel walks off, Red abruptly leaps to his feet, grabbing Rocket by the ankle -- Rocket FLAILS VIOLENTLY a Red drags him across the dirt and ice... Caesar watches in horror as the turncoats move in, BEATIN ROCKET into submission as they HURL him into the pen. One roughly SHACKLES HIM -- as Red delivers a last, VICIOUS K leaving Rocket in a crumpled heap as they exit. Caesar's stricken eyes remain fixed on Rocket as he strug to his feet. His face bloodied and bruised, Rocket looks back at Caesar through the bars of their pens -- and to Caesar's surprise, Rocket smiles at him... He SIGNS:
34) 37) dialog: They say we are inhumane. Indecent. They call us a death squad. But they'll never understand the extent of our sacrifice. How agonizing it has been to do what must be done, even as it tears at our very souls. Because there are times when you must abandon your humanity in the fight to save humanity. All of you have shown the courage to do that... But now we must take that fight to them, or this hellish trial will all have been in vain. (beat, still walking through the ranks)
34) 38) text: We can not fail. We're the last defense. Somewhere in this world there are more survivors. And whether they know it or not, they are counting on us. To show the will to protect them against this new plague. We've seen it here. And it's already spreading up north. If we lose this battle, there'll be nothing to stop it from spreading everywhere. If we lose, in a matter of months, the human race will gasp its last words, and go silent. Just another dumb animal, left to roam a godforsaken world. He comes to a stop in the Soldier's midst -- Preacher clo by, gazing intently -- the Colonel's tone growing intimat
34) 39) dialog: Most of you are still young men and women. And if we win, years from now, you may be sitting somewhere with your children, your grandchildren... and they'll ask you: what did you do in the greatest war...?

Impatient, the Colonel calls out to Boyle who's passing b with the first groups of chained apes -- THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
34) 44) text: Boyle!   His cuffs. Boyle heads over, starts to lock Caesar up -- when the Colonel suddenly sees something... Caesar watches as the Colonel steps toward the cage, reaches in... and retrieve THE GIRL'S DOLL. He stares at it, perplexed: THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
34) 45) text: (turning to Caesar) What is this...? But Caesar is silent.   The Colonel turns to Preacher -- THE COLONEL (CONT'D)

42) 4) dialog: Least you can take comfort... Your struggle ends... Ours goes on... Nature still has the power to wipe us off this planet at any moment... Killed the dinosaurs with a single meteor. He eerily studies Caesar's body... musing to himself:
42) 5) dialog: You apes are so strong... I wonder... what kind of world you would have built... on our graves. Caesar's eyes search the Colonel's, trying to make sense his demeanor. The Colonel gazes off, as if lost in a drea
42) 6) dialog: You know when I first got to the city... a man said he had to see me. He said he knew you. That you worked together. Caesar looks surprised.    Beat.   Finally, warily:

42) 10) dialog: He said you were remarkable.   More than just an animal...
42) 15) text: you were a great leader. I thought he was crazy... But I almost see what he meant. (he drifts off again) He pleaded with me to find you. To make peace with you. Caesar is rapt, stunned by these revelations... But the Colonel is wholly unaware of Caesar's reaction, staring o in a long unnerving silence. Caesar hesitates, then: CAESAR
42) 16) text: What... happened to this man? The Colonel remains staring off a moment longer, then fin looks at Caesar... and then off again: THE COLONEL
42) 17) text: I shot him. He remains still a moment longer -- then suddenly looks around, disoriented, as if awakened from a dream -- THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
42) 18) text: (quietly paranoid) What's going on here? Caesar frowns at him, disquieted and perplexed... The Colonel's eyes dart suspiciously around him; he cranes hi neck to peer up through the falling snow at the guard tow but the angle is too steep to see if anyone is up there - A CLANK at his feet makes him look down... where he finds he's dropped his flask. He picks it up, looks at it as if having no memory of even bringing it out here. Suddenly self-conscious, he looks around at the apes in t pen, all staring back at him -- and then at Caesar. He slowly backs away, then turns, retreating through the darkness to his tower. Caesar watches him go, then turns to find Rocket and the other apes looking at him, confused. ROCKET
42) 24) text: [Do you think he knows we're up to something?] Unsure, Caesar peers back up at the Colonel's silhouette. After a beat, the Colonel steps away from the window. Roc looks anxiously at Caesar, raising the rifle:
44) 10) text: [Hurry!   Let's go!] But Caesar stays motionless, eyes fixed intently on the Colonel's still lighted window. ROCKET (CONT'D)
47) 0) text: Caesar silently climbs in the window; he looks around... immediately spots an unnerving, incongruous sight -- THE FRONT DOOR is BARRICADED WITH FURNITURE from the insi Confused, Caesar looks around, sees the area in total disarray: a SMALL STOCKPILE OF MUNITIONS lie scattered chaotically across a table, alongside a tray of HALF-EATE FOOD and the Colonel's SPILLED FLASK... Soaked in liquid from the flask is a PHOTO OF A LITTLE BO beside it OLD WAR MEDALS; Caesar peers around, wary: wher the Colonel...?
48) 1) text: Colonel!   Are you in there?! Colonel!
