Luca notices the Girl staring up at the branch of flowers He watches a moment, then moves toward her... and reaches long arm up, snapping off a small piece of the branch.

And I pulled the trigger. It purified me. It made my purpose clear. His eyes finally return to Caesar's, who looks stunned. THE COLONEL (CONT'D)
27) 37) text: I gave orders to kill the other infected, all of them, and anyone who might've been in direct contact, even if they showed no symptoms. We burned their belongings, anything that might spread contamination. Some of the men questioned my judgment. I was asking them to do what I had done: to sacrifice their families... their friends. They refused. So I had them killed too. (growing darker) Others with children deserted into the woods. One of those cowards fled to my superiors up north. They sent officers down to restrain me. They tried to convince me this plague could be dealt with medically, that up there they were already looking for a cure. That's when I realized: they had learned nothing from our past. CAESAR

The Colonel's a great man. He sacrificed everything for us. You can't judge him. Who are you to judge him? (darkening) I was trying to give you a heads up, keep you out of his way, I don't even know why. But if you think you and I have some kind of relationship -- that you're gonna give me, what, advice? You can disavow yourself of that notion right fucking now. Caesar is stunned.    Preacher raises his crossbow:
