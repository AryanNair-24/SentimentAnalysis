1) 148) dialog: Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
1) 150) dialog: No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.

1) 167) dialog: You?  You, the high-class college kid.  You never wanted to get mixed up in the family business.  Now you wanta gun down a police Captain and the Turk just because you got slapped in the face.  You're taking it personal, it's just business and he's taking it personal. Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keep his face serious.
1) 169) text: Sonny, it's all personal, and I learned it from him, the old man, the Godfather.  He took my joining the Marines personal.  I take Sollozzo trying to kill my father personal, and you know I'll kill them Sonny. MICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.

1) 256) text: It was my fault!  I started a fight with him and I tried to hit him so he hit me.  He didn't even try to hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it. Sonny listens, and calms himself.  He touches her shoulde the thin silk robe.
