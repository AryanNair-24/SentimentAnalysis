1) 402) dialog: Don Corleone is too modest.  He had the judges and politicians in his pocket and he refused to share them. His refusal is not the act of a friend.  He takes the bread out of the mouths of our families.  Times have changed, it's not like the old days where everyone can go his own way.  If Don Corleone had all the judges and politicians in New York, then he must share them or let others use them.  Certainly he can present a bill for such services, we're not Communists, after all. But he has to let us draw water from the well.  It's that simple.
1) 407) dialog: Then, are we agreed; the traffic in drugs will be permitted, but controlled; and Don Corleone agrees to give it protection in the East. DON CORLEONE nods.
1) 408) dialog: That's the whole matter then, we have the peace, and let me pay my respects to Don Corleone, whom we have all known over the years as a man of his word. (noticing TATTAGLIA is uneasy)

1) 812) text: Barzini is dead.  So is Philip Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo and Moe Greene...I want to square all the family accounts tonight. So don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did. CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.
1) 814) text: Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
