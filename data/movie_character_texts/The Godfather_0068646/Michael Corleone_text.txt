1) 100) dialog: (coldly)
1) 103) dialog: You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
1) 107) dialog: Hurry, into there. They push it into the first available room.  MICHAEL peek out from the door.  The footsteps are louder; then they emerge.  It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouque of flowers.
1) 108) dialog: (stepping out)
1) 111) dialog: Enzo, get out of here.  There's going to be trouble. A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.

1) 119) dialog: Get rid of those and look like you've got a gun in your pocket. The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas decorations.
1) 120) dialog: Listen... We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming.  MICHAEL and ENZO look with fear in their eyes.  Then MICHAEL take the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket. They stand, hands in their pockets. A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive.  The car seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerate MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved.  MICHAEL looks down; the BAKER's hands are shaking.  He looks at his own, and they are not. Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound police sirens.  They are clearly coming toward the hospit getting louder and louder.  MICHAEL heaves a sigh of reli In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with unifor POLICE and DETECTIVES.  He smiles his relief and starts toward them.  TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his arms while ANOTHER frisks him.  A massive POLICE CAPTAIN, spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat, with beefy red face and white hair seems furious.  This i McCLUSKEY.
1) 123) dialog: (quietly)
1) 126) text: You punk-hood.  Who the hell are you to tell me my business.  I pulled them off.  I don't care how many Dago gangsters kill each other. I wouldn't lift a finger to keep your old man from getting knocked off.  Now get the hell out of here; get off this street you punk, and stay away from this hospital. MICHAEL stands quiet.
1) 127) dialog: I'll stay until you put guards around my father's room.
1) 132) dialog: (deliberately, right to McCLUSKEY's face, as he's being handcuffed)
1) 133) text: How much is the Turk paying you to set my father up, Captain? Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAE squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength. MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw.  He looks McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, he falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA MEN arrive.
1) 136) dialog: Christ, Sonny really means business. They continue walking.  TESSIO joins them.  The various BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.
1) 143) dialog: Cut it out.
1) 160) dialog: We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
1) 163) dialog: Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
1) 165) dialog: They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me. (pause)
1) 166) text: Then I'll kill them both. Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICH Silence.  SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter.  He poin a finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.
1) 168) dialog: (angrily, but cold)
1) 169) text: Sonny, it's all personal, and I learned it from him, the old man, the Godfather.  He took my joining the Marines personal.  I take Sollozzo trying to kill my father personal, and you know I'll kill them Sonny. MICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.
1) 174) text: I left it noisy, so it'll scare any pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander away. MICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.
1) 177) dialog: How bad will it be?
1) 179) dialog: Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
1) 182) dialog: A million times.
1) 198) dialog: O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
1) 207) dialog: I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
1) 212) dialog: We're going to New Jersey?
1) 214) text: Maybe. MICHAEL closes his eyes.
1) 224) dialog: (using English for emphasis)
1) 228) dialog: Is it all right if I go to the bathroom? SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious.  He studies MICHAEL w his dark eyes.  Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.
1) 233) dialog: Now I can talk.  I feel much better. The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; no he too relaxes.  SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits d comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutt his jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once ag but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hea him. The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns t speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his temple.  He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZ head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover entire area. The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket sprayed and stained with blood. SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through seems to hang in space suspended. MICHAEL pivots, and looks: There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal suspended in air before his gaping mouth. MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging throat.  He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound.  Th coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires righ through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull. The air is filled with pink mist. MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wa He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed. Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty. The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an expression of horror on his face. MICHAEL looks at his two victims: SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up the table. McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table. MICHAEL is wildly at a peak.  He starts to move out.  His hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN. He moves, not letting the gun go. MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression. His hand: still holding the gun. His face: finally he closes his eyes. His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back. He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had been recreated in wax. Then he leaves.

1) 463) dialog: (sternly)
1) 464) text: Shhhhh. He settles down to watch. The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that cling to their bodies.  They are still in their teens, bu developed and womanly. They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not aware of the three men watching them from the orange grov Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them playfully, in the direction of the grove. The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in h left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and thro them back at her pursuers laughing. They come closer and closer.  Just short of the grove, sh poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the view of the THREE MEN.  She stands there on her toes abou to run. MICHAEL sees her; now face to face.  He looks. Her face.  Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black ha and a rich mouth.

1) 483) dialog: She wore a red dress, and a red ribbon in her hair.  She looks more Greek than Italian.  Do you know a beauty like that? As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less, until he wears a scowl.
1) 488) dialog: Innkeeper.  More wine!
1) 490) text: The old bastard mentioned two sons he only has to whistle up. MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.
1) 491) dialog: Tell him to come to me. The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI between them.
1) 492) dialog: (quietly)
1) 496) dialog: I am an American hiding in Sicily from the police of my country.  My name is Michael.  You can inform the police and make your fortune but then your daughter would lose a father rather than gain a husband. In any case, I want to meet your daughter.  With your permission and under the supervision of your family.  With all decorum.  With all respect.  I am an honorable man. CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and the asks:

1) 544) text: Where the hell is he going? MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside. MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes. APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should s where he is.
1) 546) text: I'll drive to you. He smiles affectionately. CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dang by his side.  There is no sight of FABRIZZIO.  Suddenly t smile fades from MICHAEL's face.  He steps forward and ho out his hand.

1) 602) dialog: Johnny, the Don wants you to help us get started.  We figure entertainment will be the big factor in drawing gamblers.  We hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year for maybe a week long engagement. We hope your friends in the movies will do the same.  We count on you to convince them.
1) 605) dialog: Thanks.
1) 608) dialog: Is my credit good enough to buy you out? MOE laughs.
1) 610) dialog: The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out. GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense.  NERI eyes the BODYGUARDS.
1) 613) dialog: Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
1) 615) dialog: (the worst insult)
1) 618) dialog: You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
1) 620) dialog: (quietly, deadly)
1) 625) dialog: You straightened my brother out?
1) 627) dialog: I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
1) 631) dialog: The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me. Nobody answers.  MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door MOE exits angrily.

1) 662) dialog: He's going to be our lawyer in Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute.  No reflection on Tom; that's the way I want it.  Besides, if I ever need any advice, who's a better Consigliere than my father.
1) 664) dialog: Maybe less...

1) 674) dialog: I'll come to you when I need you. He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN.  They all nod, reluctantly.
1) 675) dialog: All right, then it's resolved. NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door. CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and lea then CARLO.  NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man Then NERI closes the door. MICHAEL relaxes.
1) 677) dialog: Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
1) 680) dialog: How did you find out?
1) 683) dialog: Not so perfectly if you noticed.

On his side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting dire across from the main entrance of the building.  Slowly he approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his nightstick.

1) 848) text: And do you know how many men he had killed with Carlo?  Just read the papers.  That's your husband. She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteri she has no saliva.
1) 849) dialog: Get her home and get a doctor. The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her gently but firmly. KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from MICHAEL.  He feels her look.
1) 850) dialog: She's hysterical. But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.
