0) 34) dialog: I suppose you're wondering what all  this has to do with Mr. Blandings  and his Dream House? Well, I'll tell  you. Jim Blandings is part of the  fabric of this town. Born and raised  right here, he's as typical a New  Yorker as anyone you'll ever meet.  At least he was. (confidentially) And if you want to know the real  story, I guess I'm your boy. Cole's  my name, Bill Cole. I'm Jim's lawyer  and quote, best friend, unquote.  Jim's one of those bright young men  from Yale. Advertising business,  lovely wife, two fine kids, makes  almost fifteen thousand a year. Want  to know why? Just look up there.
23) 0) text: A successful lawyer's office, the walls crowded with leat bound books. Jim and Muriel are seated facing the large d behind which sits Bill Cole. Bill finishes reading a seri of papers, the sum total of correspondence between Jim an Mr. Smith. He sets down the papers, leans back thoughtful Jim and Muriel look at him with nervous but eager  anticipation.
23) 2) dialog: (drily) It certainly is.
23) 4) dialog: Perhaps "steal" is an understatement --  "swindle" might be a little more  appropriate.
23) 6) dialog: Every time you get a little tight  you weep on my shoulder about the  advertising business and how it forces  a sensitive soul like yourself to  make a living by bamboozling the  American public. (picks up Smith's  correspondence) I would say that a small part of  this victimized group has now  redressed the balance.
23) 8) dialog: You! You've been taken to the cleaners  and you don't even know your pants  are off!
23) 11) dialog: First time around you offered ten  thousand dollars for fifty acres,  right?
23) 13) dialog: That's two hundred dollars an acre.  I know that part of Connecticut and  one hundred dollars an acre is  standard top-gouge price to city  slickers. When the natives sell to  each other it's around forty or less.
23) 16) dialog: Not two hundred and eighty-four  percent. (indicates papers) And besides, you're not getting fifty  acres, you're only getting thirty- five, more or less.

23) 22) dialog: You're not spending eleven thousand  five hundred dollars for tennis  courts!
23) 24) dialog: (very businesslike) That's precisely the point. We're  going to write this Hackett a strong  letter and tell him he can either  kick in with those fifteen acres,  reduce the price, or find another  sucker.
23) 28) dialog: You mean extortion.
23) 29) text: As Jim turns on Bill and is about to answer him explosive
23) 32) dialog: Like what, for instance?
23) 34) dialog: I don't care if General Grant dropped  in for a scotch and soda -- you're  still getting rocked!

33) 10) dialog: (frank and open) Well, I must admit it's a very  beautiful thing.
33) 13) dialog: It's a good thing there are two of  you -- one to love it and one to  hold it up.
33) 15) dialog: What'd your engineer say when he  checked over the foundation and that  roof?
33) 17) dialog: I just saw it move.
33) 20) dialog: (solicitously) Look -- let me do you a favor. I've  got a client, crackerjack structural  engineer, Joe Apollonio; he  practically built the George  Washington Bridge single-handed.
33) 22) dialog: He's the follow who advised the  Government not to raise the Normandie --  they didn't listen to him, cost them  five million dollars.
33) 24) dialog: (a skeptical look at  the roof) No thanks, I'll just stay out in the  car and listen to "Life Can Be  Beautiful."

39) 52) dialog: (ignoring him; to  Simms) And I must say, Simms, I hold you  equally responsible!
39) 55) dialog: (to Simms; indicating  Jim) Did you let this idiot tear down  that house?
39) 58) dialog: I quite agree. But you're dealing  with a man who doesn't think before  he acts, who goes off half-cocked!
39) 60) dialog: (ignoring him; to  Simms) You're an architect! You must have  been aware of the legality involved.
39) 62) dialog: (to Simms) You knew there was a mortgage on  that house.
39) 65) dialog: (ignoring him; to  Simms) And you know the requirements in  regard to a mortgage where there's  demolition intended!
39) 67) dialog: With a man like this you can't assume  anything!
39) 73) dialog: (with weary resignation) In clear, concise English, you tore  down a house on which another man  holds a mortgage without first getting  his written permission.
39) 75) dialog: And in such case, the mortgagee can  demand the full payment of said  mortgage upon demand -- (waves telegram) and Mr. Ephemus Hackett so demands!  Six thousand clams! And he wants  them now!
39) 77) dialog: You've got ten days.
39) 90) text: Good nights are exchanged. Muriel takes Simms out of scen toward the door. CAMERA HOLDS on Bill and Jim.

39) 93) dialog: What'll you do for collateral on  your building loan?
39) 101) dialog: I'm sure it won't be necessary. I'll  see the boys at the bank. Maybe you  can put up your insurance as  collateral. If necessary, I'll sign  a personal note.
39) 103) dialog: (paternally) And Jim, do me a little favor. The  next time you're going to do anything,  or say anything, or buy anything,  think it over very carefully, and  when you're sure you're right --  forget the whole thing. Good night,  Muriel.
