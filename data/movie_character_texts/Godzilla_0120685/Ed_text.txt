We SEE quick shots of Kimono Dragons, Gila Monsters and Chameleons all in their natural tropical environment. Super: Moruro Atoll Islands, French Polynesia - June 1968 Incongruously over this jungle environment we HEAR a static ridden radio filtered VOICE, slowly counting down in French. It is almost as through the reptiles of the island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously move about. Suddenly with a brilliant FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT, a nuclear EXPLOSION mushrooms into the sky. We SEE a SERIES of REAL shots of footage of some of the over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the French government held in this tropical region. Explosion after explosion devastates the locale. One building after the next, accelerating in momentum, culminating in one final EXPLOSION. The clould-filled sky begins to drizzle. The ash-like fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands below. We FOLLOW this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile, unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the lizard's eggs. Suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to clean, modern high resolution. We ZOOM IN on one of the eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash. WE continue to push in, getting closer...closer...

At the end of the console is the ship's SKIPPER, an overweight Japanese seaman sleepily watches a snowy satellite broadcast of a Sumo wrestling match. Suddenly the SONAR blares out a warning ALARM. Startled, the Skipper awakes and stumbles out of his chair over to the console. The SONAR displays an enormous MASS heading quickly toward the ship. The Skipper's eyes go wide. He hits a KLAXON alarm, awaking the entire ship. He presses the radio/intercom.
5) 2) text: What's going on? What's happening? Before anyone can answer, the ship is ROCKED by an enormous THUD as something hits the side of the immense ship. The crew TUMBLES as the ship SWAYS VIOLENTLY. The old Cook is thrown to the floor. He looks up nervously.

11) 0) text: With the infamously crippled nuclear power plant in the distance, the utility van slides to a muddy stop by this field of dirt. Nick hops out quickly and rushes to the back of the van. He opens the back of the van and grabs several metallic cases. Walking a few yards away from the van, he dumps the cases on the ground, opening them to REVEAL an assortment of sophisticated scientific equipment. Taped to the inside are several photos of a girl we'll meet later. Some of the photos are of her looking young and beautiful. Others are of the two of them happily together. With a switch he turns on the equipment which comes to life. Inside one of the cases are several cables attached to long SPIKES. He grabs them and dashes away.

15) 2) text: Ask him what happened. The Second Official ask him in Japanese, but the old Cook does not respond. He asks again but the old Cook seems to be in a world of his own.
15) 4) text: It's no use. He's been like this since we fished him out of the ocean. Whatever happened to that tanker put him in a complete state of shock. Raymond takes out his lighter and ignites it on high. The old Cook's eyes slowly come back to life, transfixed by the fire. Slowly he brings the flame close to the old Cook's face.

One particular spot, above him, seems slightly stronger. Nick SEES something there. He opens his knapsack and puts on some rubber gloves, removing a glass jar (like the ones from Chernobyl) Carefully he climbs the debris until he reaches a sharp shard of metal. Clinging to it he finds a MEATY CHUNK OF REPTILE FLESH. He tries remove it but he only gets half. He places it into his jar. Just as he reaches for the other half, SOMETHING GIVES WAY. With a JOLT, the section above him collapses. A rush of water falls and a HUMAN BODY swings down, just in front of him. Nick tumbles backwards, his heart pounding. The body swings lifelessly as it hangs from above. The others rush to his side, checking to see if he's all right.
