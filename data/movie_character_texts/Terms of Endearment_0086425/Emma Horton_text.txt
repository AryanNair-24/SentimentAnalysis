He holds a hand out to assist ROSIE DUNLOP, AURORA'S maid for years and, though she doesn't know it, the last white maid in Houston. She refuses the hand and concentrates on the next one out, folding back the front seat for EMMA GREENWAY-- misshapen for a child of eight--her legs too short, her hands too thick--that sort of thing--hair, unusually stringy, is even worse after the sweaty and emotional funeral, a black ribbon hangs lifeless in her tresses. She too refuses help and indicates that the man should instead help the next cecupant. That's AURORA, who emerges in black, one hand held by the man, the cther by her maid. The first thing she does on emerging from the car is to remeve her shoes. She has her arm around her young daughter as she moves barefoot across the lawn. (CONTINUED)

There are stairs leading up to the door and an area at the top of the stairs with just enough room for a somewhat rusty porch swing. Houston is built on a swamp. It is tropical; the air is extraordinarily sensual and, for EMMA, sitting outside on one of those humid, fragrant summer nichts is part of what being Houstonian is all abeut. So she sits here now with her new husbande, still halt dressed in the clothes they were married in, a bit drunk from champagne, with their belongings inside awaiting the setting up of housekeeping if energy ever strikes.

Now they go at it on the mattress, the windows open, lamps on at the other end of the room provice illumi- mation. When FLAP gets horny, it would never occur to him to close doors or shut out lights.

But we had lots of years and we did a lot of talking-- and some people don't get that... Listen, I want you to make a lot of friends. And don't be afraid of girls--they're going to be so much help to you, I swear.
143) 31) dialog: Well, you micht be later on.
143) 35) dialog: Shhh. Come on. Teddy? Give me a kiss. They kiss on the lips. TEDDY kisses her a few extra times and so does she. She does the last extra kisses in a way which makes him smile. She gestures to TOMMY who kisses her cheek cuickly. He is tortured and somehow being stiff and foul is simpler for him right now.
143) 36) dialog: Tommy, be sweet. Be sweet, please. Don't keep pretending you dislike me. That's silly.
143) 40) dialog: Then will you listen to me especially hard?
143) 42) dialog: You'll listen close?
143) 44) dialog: (petting his arm) I know that you like me. I know it. But for the last year or two you've been pretending you hate me. I love you a let, as much as I love anybody, as much as I love myself. And in a few years when I haven't been around to be on your tail about something or irritating you, you're going to remember my buying your baseball glove when you thought we were too broke, and how I read you these stories and let you goof off instead of mowing the lawn... lots of things. You're soins to realize you loved me. And maybe you're going to feel badly because you never told me. Don't. Because I already know you love me. So you must not ever do that to voursels. Okay? TOMMY pauses. His brother looking at him with hope and urging that he says "I love you". He doesn't.
143) 46) dialog: Good. You'd both better run alone now. Take care. I was scared of this, but I think it went really well, don't you? The boys nod.

Her mother smiles at her with quiet and mystic reassurance-- their final communication. EMMA turns; AURORA looks out the window. The door opens, a nurse enters. She ehecks EMMA. This is the same nurse who had the run-in with AURORA. She's a bit reluctant to approach her. She touches FLAP, who awakens.

The casual, mournful, unstructured conversation of our characters, as they drink, eat and talk about EMMA and inevitably about her mother as well. This to continue as we finally... FADE OUT.
