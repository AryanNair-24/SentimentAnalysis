He holds a hand out to assist ROSIE DUNLOP, AURORA'S maid for years and, though she doesn't know it, the last white maid in Houston. She refuses the hand and concentrates on the next one out, folding back the front seat for EMMA GREENWAY-- misshapen for a child of eight--her legs too short, her hands too thick--that sort of thing--hair, unusually stringy, is even worse after the sweaty and emotional funeral, a black ribbon hangs lifeless in her tresses. She too refuses help and indicates that the man should instead help the next cecupant. That's AURORA, who emerges in black, one hand held by the man, the cther by her maid. The first thing she does on emerging from the car is to remeve her shoes. She has her arm around her young daughter as she moves barefoot across the lawn. (CONTINUED)

A window seat, also cushy, overlooks the back garden. AURORA sits in her nightgown at the window seat. Her bed has been turned down but she cannot quite bring herself to go to it; she is angry at being upset. She rises and goes to the door.

AURORA can now be fully and clearly seen for the first time without veil or shadews. She is nearing 40 and she has a rather simple method for appearing younger. She allows herself to be courted by much older men. Standing over her as she reclines in her chaise is EDWARD JOHNSON. He's S6 years old. He's here to assert himself but once more AURORA is putting him through some trying paces.

(Emma waits) So I've been trying--trying to ignore tke truth. (launching in) I am totally convinced that your getting married to Flap Horton tomorrow is a mistake of such proportions that it would eripple your destiny and make wretched your lite. EMMA doesn't know what hit her.
13) 8) dialog: Flap is limited, he has no imagination. Even at this ace, all he wants is a secure teaching job. He's not that attractive... his teeth...
13) 10) dialog: Because I'm your mother and I know you're not special enough to overcome a bad marriage.

13) 18) dialog: No. I mean it. This is a crossroads for us. Don't make a mistake. Do you want to stay my daughter or not? Almost literally AURORA is shoving her daugher's words back down her throat. Wills lock only briefly before EMMA'S gives way.
13) 20) dialog: That's more like it.
13) 23) dialog: I think you're right. The hypocrisy was bothering me too. EMMA exits in disbelief.

14) 6) dialog: How was it?
14) 12) dialog: Thank you. I'm pleased you dropped by.
14) 14) dialog: Miss...Miss... The hungover girl mumbles incoherently--the chain reaction to AURORA'S pushing her shoulder is to have the girl's hand jiggle the man's privates.

He accepts their embraces while holding a waste basket full of empty liquor bottles in the other hand. Now he restrains one girl, bidding her to stay; she nods acquiescence. She waits for him while he happily goes around to the side of the house-- the driveway adjoining AURORA'S--removes the lid from one of his main garbage cans to empty his container into it. He misses. The bottles crash. He looks at the mess, then does some twinkle-toed broken glass running back to the girl. She laughs.

A hand reaches through the passenger's window, an umbrella opens; AURORA steps out being ever so careful as she switches the umbrella to the other hand, steps gingerly to the street, is startled by a passing car and falls face down into the street. As EMMA rushes around the car towards her, the spray from the wheels of a passing truck drench AURORA, the packages she was carrying moiste and open showing the garments she purchased. As EMMA struggles with her mother, they look up and react:

She, in turn, is fixed on the spectacle of CECIL using a prawn to mop up the very last traces from his plate. He is really into it, dipping the prawn in the gravy and slurping it dry, then re-dipping it. cEcIL . (mouth full) And you thought I couldn't do...

AURORA is waiting with growing impatience for ROSIE to finish hugging and kissing EMMA goodbye. Just as they seem to have finished their last squeeze, one of them gets the need for just one mere; it’s almost an informal reception line with the reception growing colder as they move from EMMA to TOMMY to his father.
