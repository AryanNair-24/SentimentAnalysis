35) 7) dialog: Mia?
35) 9) dialog: She's a friend of my little sister. Her brother was ina pretty serious car accident, and she's a little upset. Amanda glares at him. She's never been very good holding up her side of an argument with Hardy.
35) 10) dialog: I'm waiting for you. I know you're coming, why would I be trying to make another girl? It makes no sense at all. Amanda backs down a bit. He's charming logic leaves her without an immediate counter.
35) 11) dialog: How can you be so beautiful and so insecure at the same time? In lieu of something to say, she holds her look on him.
35) 12) dialog: Trust is the basis of any relationship. I trust you. He leans forward and kisses her forehead. (CONTINUED)
35) 15) dialog: I'll drive you home. He points to a ring on his baby finger. He points to her. He slips it off, takes her hand, slips the ring on her finger and kisses her again. She doesn't say yes. She doesn't say no. Hardy takes the answer as yes.
35) 16) dialog: I'll get the car and meet you in front. He heads down the hall. In the direction Mia went. Amanda looks at the floor and sighs angrily. She's upset with herself. She wants to bust him but can't. She senses that she's being watched. She turns.

98) 16) dialog: (big grin) I didn't come here to talk about art. Keith doesn't reply. Hardy smiles. Eases up.
98) 17) dialog: I'm completely cool with the situation. The truth? I was looking for a way out of the thing with Amanda, and, weird as it is, you saved me a tough talk. (CONTINUED)
98) 21) dialog: Why not? It's true. I don't want Amanda hating me. I don't want anybody hating me. So, I'd appreciate it if you'd do me a favor. Keith waits cautiously.

98) 25) dialog: Yeah. I've invited a lot of people. Something wrong?
98) 27) dialog: Nothing wrong on my end. You got an inferiority complex or something? (pause) I don't know you all that well; I may not even like you if I get to know you. That's not the issue.

98) 29) dialog: Put yourself in mine. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
98) 32) dialog: I'm big enough to invite a former girlfriend and the guy who stole her from me to a party. You think all this makes me look good? I've taken plenty of shit over this one.
98) 34) dialog: I'll buy that. You want the plain truth? Keith shrugs. He's not so sure he'd recognize it.
98) 35) dialog: I have a lot of pride. And it's been damaged, and I don't like it. I can recover it, in my own mind at least, by showing people whose opinions matter to me that you and I are friends. Then it's not like you stole Amanda from me. Bad blood makes me look like a fool. If we're friends, it's okay. I've traded off lots of girls to friends. That's acceptable. It's not acceptable some stranger lifting Amanda off me.
98) 37) dialog: Probably, but that's what it is. You tell anybody I had this conversation with you and I'll kick the shit out of you. That's a promise. He slides off the table and grabs his gym bag. He heads for the door.

178) 11) dialog: (vicious, bitter) She do you?
178) 16) text: Her friends. They avoid her eyes. All ashamed that they'r not doing anything in her defense. A scan across them end ing on Shayne. She can't look at Amanda. She doesn't con- done what Hardy's saying, but she doesn't try to stop it. She's sitting on the fence.

179) 3) dialog: She's the trash. (to Keith) You're just a fool. (to his friends) Take him outside and kick the shit out of him.
