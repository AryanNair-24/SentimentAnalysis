14) 1) text: Keith's sister, LAURA, is sitting on the floor going thro his records. LP's are out of their sleeves. She's rudely holding an LP, looking at the label. Keith's room is a shrine to art. It's a serious shelter from the outside world. One wall is covered, every inch, with reproduction posters, art show posters, art postcard reproductions torn from books and magazines. A collage of the history of art. A second wall is devoted to his own sketches. A third wall is a trompe l'oeil of an endless marble gallery. The fourth wall is hung with his own can- vases. A stereo carefully put together out of discarded pieces and parts. His bed is a mattress on the floor. A chair direct from the dump. A rug from off a curb during spring trash pick-up day. A desk made of an old door held up by two oil drums. The surface is covered with sketches and india ink pens and brushes, ink bottles. Clay and pla ter models and studies. Everywhere are found objects, things intended for future pieces and studies. It is an artist's studio in a boy's bedroom. There's no question from his surroundings that he's serious about his talent.
14) 2) dialog: I'm looking for that song about the guy that killed himself for the girl that hated his guts. She looks up.
14) 6) dialog: Disregards his anger.
14) 7) dialog: Do you know which song I'm talking about? Keith takes the LP from Laura.
14) 9) dialog: Yes, I do. That's why I don't let anyone in my room.
14) 11) dialog: (outraged) God, are you in a bad mood!
14) 13) dialog: Is this a side effect of being massively unliked or...? Keith grabs Laura by the arm, rips her to her feet, walks her to the door and shoves her out.
14) 14) dialog: She's enraged.
14) 15) dialog: If I get a black and blue mark you monger, you're dead! The door slams on her. She screams at the top of her voic
14) 16) dialog: Mom!
15) 0) text: The family are eating dinner. Laura is showing her upper arm to Carol.
15) 1) dialog: Look at it. You see what he did to me? Carol looks.
15) 3) dialog: Then you need glasses. If I wanted to sit out, I couldn't wear a bathing suit.
15) 7) dialog: I have practically no feeling left in the upper part of my arm.
15) 9) dialog: I wish just once you guys could experience the humiliation of having the weirdest guy ina huge school be a blood relative.
15) 11) dialog: This whole family revolves around Keith. I'm sick of it. (CONTINUED)
15) 19) dialog: Do you know what a total waste of money it's going to be letting him go to college? He'll have this expensive education that he'll never use because all he wants to do is make incredibly ugly art that won't ever look good in anybody's house. Cliff, Carol and Cindy stare at her.
15) 20) dialog: Am I wrong?
31) 1) text: He waves to Laura.
31) 2) dialog: We PUSH IN ON her face as she screams.
79) 2) dialog: She's staring. Very confused.
80) 0) text: Laura's held her tongue. She's been staring at Keith the whole time. Studying the change in him. Finally she speak
80) 1) dialog: This isn't true. It can't be. It has to be like the most hilarious rumor ever floated, right? Keith doesn't respond. He just smiles.
80) 3) dialog: Okay, I'm in town last night and I hear everybody saying that Keith asked a girl out.
80) 5) dialog: Check it out. She's scandalously popular, insanely beautiful and obviously in the middle of some emotional shoot-out to consent to date the human Tater Tot. (to Keith) What'd you do to her? Threaten her life?
80) 7) dialog: Her boyfriend's a man, for Christ's sake. He's extensively easy on the eyes, he's a total buck and you're... you're Keith.
80) 9) dialog: Mother, the girl is sex.
80) 15) dialog: Ease up, Dad. Any fool can get into a college. Only a precious few can say the same thing about Amanda Jones. Cliff and Keith stare at Laura.
80) 16) dialog: Am I wrong?
93) 10) dialog: Hey! What's going on? Amanda and Shayne turn quickly.
93) 11) text: Laura's leaning in Shayne's window.
93) 12) dialog: Come by to see Keith?
93) 15) dialog: She laughs, fake and phoney.
93) 16) dialog: And he told you we live here? He is so modest. (straight) I suppose he didn't say a word about our ancestral estate in Scotland or the apartment in Paris? So modest! This isa tax thing my father picked up. Well, I have to run. I have to go over to our stables and comb out the horses. She backs away from the car.
94) 0) text: Keith's at the arch to the kitchen drinking out of the orange juice carton. Laura walks in.
94) 1) dialog: Hi, ass-face. I saw your girl- friend out in front. Keith lowers the carton suspiciously. (CONTINUED)
94) 5) dialog: That's for me to know, and you to find out. She heads up the stairs.
108) 0) text: Big, new, anonymous mall. Laura is sitting on a planter talking to a group of her friends.
108) 1) dialog: I'm his sister. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
108) 4) dialog: If you're a brother or a sister, you're in. It's like they have to accept you, or the whole social structure caves in.
108) 6) dialog: Of course. I'm probably going to the one Saturday at Hardy Jenns'. Keith's going with Amanda. We might double.
108) 8) dialog: The choices are limitless.
108) 10) dialog: Eventually. If you stay cool.
108) 12) dialog: Oh, really?
109) 0) text: Friend 2 turns back to Laura.
109) 4) dialog: Because I'm here with you, twerp.
109) 6) dialog: Is this a challenge or something?
109) 8) dialog: I was hanging with you fungi in a vain effort to cool you out, but all I get is breeze, so, cie la vie. She heads down the mall. The girls watch curiously. Laura sneaks glances back at them. She's over-estimated the si- tuation badly.
109) 11) text: Laura strolls down the mall. She slows as she reaches the boys. She looks back at the girls, strikes an attitude an flips them off. She slides up on another planter, adjacen to the group. It looks like she's a part of the group.
109) 12) dialog: She's not really connected to the people. She's just on the edges. She puts herself in a sexy, careless attitude. The boys are below and to the side of her. Unaware of her
109) 16) dialog: A puzzled look as she eavesdrops.
109) 19) dialog: She's devastated by what she's overheard. Stunned. All the evil she's done on Keith comes rushing back on her. Tears gather in her eyes. She leaps down off the planter and takes off down the mall.

111) 0) text: It's night. Lights are burning. Laura rides up on her bicycle.

114) 1) text: Keith turns slowly to the door and sees Laura. He stares at her.
114) 3) dialog: She's serious and grieved.
114) 4) dialog: I'm sorry, Keith. I thought if I knocked, you wouldn't open up, and I want to talk.
115) 2) dialog: I heard something tonight at the mall. Hardy Jenns and his guys were there, and I heard them talking about you.
115) 4) dialog: I've jumped on you pretty hard for a pretty long time, Keith.
115) 6) dialog: You know the blood's thicker than water stuff? Keith rotates his finger, signalling her to get to the gi of her intrusion. (CONTINUED)
115) 9) dialog: It's true. I thought I hated you. I really did. But I don't.
115) 11) dialog: Keith, it's a joke. Amanda Jones. The date. The party. The whole thing's a joke. She's going out with you to get you to Hardy Jenns' house so he can mess you up. Keith freezes.
115) 12) dialog: I heard Hardy say it. I heard him. It's true.
115) 14) dialog: I'm sorry, Keith. For everything. She backs slowly out the room and closes the door. We HEA the CLICK of the LOCK. Laura's used her butter knife to secure the door for Keith. MUSIC COMES UP. Keith turns to the window.
143) 53) dialog: Hi. I was just coming to tell Keith that Watts is downstairs to pick him up.
143) 55) dialog: Keith? Do you think it's possible that Dad'll stay this cool, or do you think he'll go back to normal in the morning?
143) 57) dialog: (smiles) I'll pray. Good luck tonight. I got all my friends crossing their fingers for you. (CONTINUED)
143) 60) dialog: You want me to lock up for you? She twists the butter knife.
