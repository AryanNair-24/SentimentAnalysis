34) 12) dialog: Make an exception?
34) 14) dialog: Not this. They stride on, cutting through the crowd, Joe all at hom in his new surrounding, but Parrish just the opposite, un characteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his lips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out:

71) 14) dialog: You're the poison, Drew.  You've operated behind-the-scenes to suborn the trust of a man who has stamped you with his imprimatur of class and elegance and stature.  I've seen all kinds and degrees of deception in my time, but Bill Parrish has been on the receiving end of machinations so Machiavellian that it has rarely been my experience to encounter.  And yet he has combatted them stoically, and selflessly, without revealing my identity.  Had he violated the vow of secrecy he took, his task would have been far easier, he could have turned defeat into victory, but he is too honorable a man to have done that.  And now I must release him from that vow.  Because of me, he has lost his work, his company, his reputation -- and now he's going to tell you who I am. Parrish is struck dumb.  He looks at Joe pleadingly, shak his head imperceptibly, but Joe nods to him blithely -- a then commandingly.
71) 17) dialog: -- And now you're going to pee some more.

71) 32) dialog: Yes, I am. (to Drew)
71) 33) text: IRS man. Drew's head swivels from Joe to Parrish and back again.
71) 36) dialog: (to Parrish)
71) 39) dialog: Undisclosed conflict of interest --
71) 41) dialog: An indictable offense. Silence.
71) 49) dialog: (to Drew)
71) 50) text: And he's talking through his lips. Joe steps forward. JOE (cont'd)
71) 57) dialog: My pleasure.  This is an IRS Agent's dream.  I'll be promoted to Chief of Section off of this. Parrish clicks the speakerphone off.  Drew is staring at Joe, shaking his head.

72) 32) dialog: Do you have any peanut butter? The Waiter hesitates.
72) 34) dialog: Thank you, anyway. The Waiter moves off.  Joe's attention returns to Parrish Susan, the dance number ends, a BOOM.
72) 40) dialog: Happy Birthday, Bill.
72) 43) dialog: Not exactly.
72) 45) dialog: Yes. Silence.
72) 48) dialog: I wouldn't worry about it, Bill. These things have a way of working out. Joe regards Parrish, waits until he has a sense that Parr has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues: JOE (cont'd)
72) 49) text: And would you mind if I expressed my gratitude...? Parrish waits. JOE (cont'd)
72) 53) dialog: Yes.
72) 55) text: Down below, the party guests' faces are lit by the initia fireworks display.  Among them is Susan, but her interest isn't there.  Not something pulls her attention, an over- powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a distance, Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow.  So thing about the sight saddens and at the same time fright her, she turns back to the party, dazed, tracing on the fireworks.

72) 58) text: Should I be afraid? Joe stops, Parrish stops with him.
72) 59) dialog: Not a man like you. Parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides out again, Joe right with him.  In tandem they continue on and disappear over the crest of the hill.  A barrage of fireworks lights up the sky.
72) 60) text: Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and lo up towards the hill.  There is nobody there.

72) 65) dialog: I don't know -- y'know, I don't know -- it's all blurred up and hazy.  And would y'know what I mean if I said I don't think it's worth figuring out? Some realization is dawning on Susan, it renders her lightheaded. JOE (cont'd)
72) 66) text: ...But now I'm back. Susan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an answer.
72) 69) dialog: Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
72) 71) dialog: Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here. Susan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of h jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggl with the last moments fades away. Susan slowly realizes this is the Young Man. She is shake a sudden intake of breath.
