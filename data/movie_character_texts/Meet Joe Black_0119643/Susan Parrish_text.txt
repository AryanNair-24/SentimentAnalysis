A warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each other, now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recogniz as such, Joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily bu has no knowledge where it is leading.  His movements are instinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin- gers, odd things about her seem to interest him.  This excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the very sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each oth are intuitive and spontaneous; even though Joe has no kno ledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his acti are such that they never beg the question -- has he done before. Strange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exe ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovema ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and Susan builds.  Joe has found himself in an unexplored lan of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and ye at the same time, is terrified by it.  He feels himself b lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is do is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on. The powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and i the end there is the knowledge they have together made a journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of ev they have created; and they don't care about the conseque Spent, they lie in silence.  Finally Susan speaks:
53) 16) dialog: It's so wonderful to make love to you.  It's like making love to some- one who has never made love before. Joe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she h said, but to tell her more, even the truth about himself. He weighs, then resists, the impulse.
