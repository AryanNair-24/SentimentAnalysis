STAGE. DAY. SAM is now "JULIET." The play has evidently reached Act I Scene 5. We are witnessing the meeting of "ROMEO" and  "JULIET" in a simplified version of the changing-partners dance we saw at VIOLA'S house. NED ALLEYN is in charge.

7) 174) text: For lewdness and unshamefacedness! For  displaying a female on the public  stage! TILNEY is unstoppable. He jumps on the stageВ…and seizes  SAM GOSSE. Before WEBSTER or anyone can intervene, TILNEY pulls up his skirt, ignoring SAM'S rather gutteral yell  of protest and pulls down SAM'S drawers.  TILNEY'S face is a study. So is everybody else's. WEBSTER rolls his eyes (oh, these stupid grown-ups!) and deftly  throws one of his mice onto "ROMEO'S" hair. VIOLA gives a shrill scream, the startled mouse descends her neck via  VIOLA'S ear, and seeks an entry into her collar. By which time VIOLA has gone berserk and torn off her wig. Her  hair is pinned up but there is no question her gender.  WILL is paralysed. VIOLA gives him a look of terrible  despair and apology.
