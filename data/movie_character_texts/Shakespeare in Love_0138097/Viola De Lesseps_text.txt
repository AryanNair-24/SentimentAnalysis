3) 4) dialog: Did you like Proteus or Valentine  best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine  for looks.
3) 6) dialog: But Silvia I did not care for much.  His fingers were red from fighting and  he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons.  Stage love will never be true love  while the law of the land has our  heroines played by pipsqueak boys in  petticoats! Oh, when can we see  another?
3) 8) dialog: But at the playhouse. Nurse?
3) 11) dialog: I am not so well-born.
3) 13) dialog: All the men at court are without  poetry. If they look at me they see my  father's fortune. I will have poetry  in my life. And adventure. And love.  Love above all.
3) 15) dialog: No . . . not the artful postures of  love, but love that over- throws life.  Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot  in the heart, and nothing to be done,  come ruin or rapture. Love like there  has never been in a play. (beat)
3) 18) dialog: (kissing her)
3) 19) text: But I would be Valentine and Silvia  too. Good Nurse, God save you and good  night. I would stay asleep my whole  life if I could dream myself into a  company of players. VIOLA goes over to the window. INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. The NURSE thrusts a twig to her face.
3) 132) dialog: Thomas Kent. I would like to do a  speech by a writer who commands the  heart of every player. WILL can hardly manage a nod.
3) 133) dialog: "What light is light, if Silvia be not  seen, What joy is joy, if Silvia be  not by? Unless it be to think that she  is by And feed upon the shadow of  perfection. It does not take four lines of "VALENTINE'S" speech to  confirm for us, if confirmation be needed, that THOMAS is VIOLA. For WILL, amazement at hearing his own words soon  gives away to something else. He is captivated. He has  found his "ROMEO".
3) 134) dialog: " В…except I be by Silvia in the night,  There is no music in the nightingale.  Unless I look on Silvia in the day,  There is no day for me to look upon." WILL interrupts "him."
3) 136) dialog: My hat?
3) 138) dialog: 
3) 141) dialog: Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
3) 160) dialog: God save you, mother. (to NURSE)
3) 170) dialog: (delighted)
3) 174) dialog: (devouring the letter)
3) 178) dialog: (gaily)
3) 181) dialog: Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent  the life of Viola De Lesseps's  dreaming.
3) 184) dialog: (twice as firmly)
3) 199) dialog: Master Shakespeare WILL reacts, surprised by her reaction. The dance  separates them. VIOLA finds herself opposite WESSEX.
3) 201) dialog: My lord.
3) 203) dialog: So my lord? I speak with him every  day. WESSEX scowls. The dance separates them. VIOLA finds  herself opposite WILL again. WILL stares at her  entranced.
3) 204) dialog: Good sirВ… ? WILL has lost his tongue.
3) 205) dialog: I heard you are a poet. WILL nods in his trance and she smiles at him.
3) 206) dialog: But a poet of no words? WILL tries to speak but the silver tongue won't work. He  is dumb with adoration. Suddenly WESSEX takes him affably by the elbow and leads him into an alcove.
3) 215) text: Christopher Marlowe at your service. WESSEX shoves him through the nearest door. VIOLA'S eyes are searching the room for WILL. She finds  WESSEX smiling at her. She looks away.
3) 217) dialog: Romeo, Romeo . . . a young man of  Verona. A comedy. By William  Shakespeare. WILL reckons that's a good enough cue. He comes out of  hiding, and approaches the balcony.
3) 220) dialog: (gasps)
3) 223) dialog: Anon, good nurse. Anon. (to WILL)
3) 226) dialog: Oh but why "alas?"
3) 228) dialog: Alas indeed, for I thought you the  highest poet of my esteem and a writer  of plays that capture my heart.
3) 230) dialog: (to NURSE)
3) 234) text: Oh, I am fortune's fool, I will be  punished for this! VIOLA returns. WILL comes forward again.
3) 236) dialog: If they find you here they will kill  you.
3) 238) dialog: Oh, not for the world! The NURSE calls her again: "Madam!"
3) 239) dialog: Anon, nurse! But she goes inside. WILL looks around and sees that  there is, as ever a convenient tree. He starts to climb  up toward the balcony. When his head is nearly level, a  soft figure comes once more onto the balcony. WILL pops  his head over the parapet and is face to face with the  NURSE. The NURSE gives a yell. WILL falls out of the  tree. EXT. DE LEESEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT. Male voice shout to each other inside the house, candle  flames appear in different windows, the garden door is  flung open, revealing SIR ROBERT with candelabra in one  hand and sword in the other. By this time WILL is on top  of the garden wall and he drops safely out of sight. He  could have written it better. INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAWN. WILL is burning the midnight oil--literally and  metaphorically. His quill has already covered a dozen  sheets. He is inspired. INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. It is day one. THE COMPANY is on stage. PETER is passing  pages around a bunch of actors. JOHN, JAMES, and NOL are  looking through their pages.
3) 313) dialog: "Is the day so young?" The voice is THOMAS'S. WILL turns back to the stage and  sees him. Today THOMAS has a wig as well as his small  mustache.
3) 315) dialog: "Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that  my father that went hence so fast?"
3) 317) dialog: "Not having that which, having, makes  them short."
3) 320) dialog: "Out."
3) 322) dialog: "Out of her favour where I am in  love."
3) 325) dialog: Yes, sir.
3) 327) dialog: No, sir.
3) 333) dialog: (timidly--looking through his  few sheets of paper)
3) 347) dialog: Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
3) 349) dialog: You flatter, my lord.
3) 352) dialog: Do you intend to marry, my lord?
3) 355) dialog: I do not love you, my lord.
3) 357) dialog: Virginia?!
3) 359) dialog: But why me?
3) 362) dialog: The Queen has consented?
3) 364) dialog: (forced to submit)
3) 365) text: I will do my duty, my lord. INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. She is writing to WILL. His letter-poem is on her table.  We can read part of it. "Shall I compare thee to a  summer's dayВ…" Now we see what VIOLA is writing. INSERT: "Master Will, poet dearest to my heart, I beseech you, banish me from yours--I am to marry Lord Wessex-- a  daughter's dutyВ… " She sheds a romantic, unhappy tear. INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. SAM is now "JULIET." The play has evidently reached Act I Scene 5. We are witnessing the meeting of "ROMEO" and  "JULIET" in a simplified version of the changing-partners dance we saw at VIOLA'S house. NED ALLEYN is in charge.
3) 378) text: Did you give her my letter? VIOLA as THOMAS turns to see WILL some way behind,  following in another boat. She takes a letter from her  coat and holds it aloft.
3) 379) dialog: (calling)
3) 380) text: And this for you. EXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT. WILL has climbed aboard VIOLA'S boat and is tearing open  the letter. What he reads causes him great pain. He  collapses into the stern seat next to VIOLA.
3) 385) dialog: If you love her, you must do what she  asks.
3) 387) dialog: It is only ours you can know.
3) 389) dialog: Does she say so?
3) 391) dialog: I В… Her letter came to me by the  nurse.
3) 393) dialog: (catching up)
3) 396) dialog: Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and  heat. (collecting herself)
3) 399) dialog: And her lips?
3) 401) dialog: And her voice? Like lark song?
3) 403) dialog: She sings too?
3) 405) dialog: (glinting)
3) 408) dialog: I think the lady is wise to keep your  love at a distance. For what lady  could live up to it close to, when her  eyes and lips and voice may be no more  beautiful than mine? Besides, can a  lady born to wealth and noble marriage  love happily with a Bankside poet and  player?
3) 411) dialog: But what of Lord Wessex?
3) 413) dialog: Oh, Will! She throws a coin to the BOATMAN and runs towards the  house.
3) 422) dialog: Can you love a player? They run together and fall into a passionate kiss.
3) 425) dialog: Answer me only this: are you the  author of the plays of William  Shakespeare?
3) 427) dialog: Then kiss me again for I am not  mistook. They run together and fall into a passionate kiss. VIOLA  fumbles with his clothing, he with hers.
3) 428) dialog: I do not know how to undress a man.
3) 432) dialog: I would not have thought it. There is  something better than a play.
3) 434) dialog: Even your play.
3) 437) dialog: And that was only my first try.
3) 441) dialog: Will Then he starts to get out of bed.
3) 442) dialog: You would not leave me?
3) 444) dialog: (pulling him down)
3) 447) dialog: It was the owl--come to bed She is winning. She kisses him and pulls the bedclothes  around them.
3) 450) dialog: (pausing, pushing him away)
3) 454) dialog: Oh--no, no!
3) 457) dialog: It is broad day! (the rooster crows again)
3) 460) dialog: You would leave us players without a  scene to read today?! There's a knock at the door.
4) 3) dialog: It is a new world! INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. The cut is to the middle of a rehearsal. We are coming up to the moment when "ROMEO" and "JULIET" kiss for the  first time (Act I Scene V) NED ALLEYN is in charge but  WILL is watching. His life has turned perfect.
4) 4) dialog: "В…Have not saints lips, and holy  palmers too?"
4) 6) dialog: "Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what  hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest  faith turn to despair." WILL is in her eye-line. Her eyes flash an intimate  secret look to him.
4) 11) text: Suffering cats! VIOLA guiltily picks up her line.
4) 12) dialog: "Then move not, while my prayer's  effect I take." In character, VIOLA kisses SAM, demurely, but apparently  not demurely enough for WILL, who gives a twitch.
4) 13) dialog: "Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin  is purg'd."
4) 15) dialog: "Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly  urg'd. Give me my sin again." VIOLA kisses SAM again. WILL gives a major twitch, which  in fact catapults his body onto the stage. Everybody  looks at him in surprise.
4) 18) dialog: Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly  urg'd. Give me my sin again." VIOLA kisses WILL. They lose themselves for a fraction of a moment. As VIOLA withdraws her lips, WILL'S lips are  going for it again.
4) 19) dialog: "You kiss by th' book."
4) 25) dialog: "What is her mother?"
4) 29) dialog: "Is she a Capulet" Oh dear account. My  life is my foe's debt." NOL, AS "BENVOLIO," at a party, carrying a goblet, tipsy, enters the scene.
4) 31) text: "Away, be gone, the sport is at best." VIOLA, about to make her exit, has her hand holding the  curtain at the gap. INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY. WILL is kissing her hand. INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.
4) 32) dialog: "Ay, so I fear; the more is my  unrest." INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY. VIOLA comes through the curtain. WILL and VIOLA kiss,  dangerously--they are in a narrow space, hidden from the  general backstage area.
4) 34) dialog: (to Will)
4) 38) dialog: Oh, do not go
4) 42) text: Terrible! INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY. WILL arrives at the top of the building in his writer's  corner. He spins around once in a circle, rubs his hands  together and spits on the floor. His manuscript is all  over the table.  We take a peak at the lines he has already written.  INSERT MANUSCRIPT: "But soft, what light through yonder  window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun."  VIOLA'S VOICE OVER speaks the line.
4) 43) dialog: "But soft, what light through yonder  window breaks? It is the east and  Juliet is the sun!" INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING.
4) 44) dialog: (reading)
4) 45) text: "Arise fair sun and kill the envious  moon Who is already sick and pale with  grief That thou her maid art far more  fair than sheВ…" VIOLA is in bed, reading the lines from the manuscript  page. WILL is in bed with her, reading with her.
4) 46) dialog: Oh, Will!
4) 48) dialog: (continuing reading)
4) 49) text: "It is my lady, O it is my love! O  that she knew she were!" INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. VIOLA continues the speech, edge-to-edge, now in  rehearsal, with SAM as "JULIET" sighing on the balcony  above her.
4) 50) dialog: "The brightness of her cheek would  shame those stars As daylight doth a  lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through  the airy region stream so bright That  birds would sing and think it were not  night. See how she leans her cheek  upon her hand. O that I were a glove  upon that hand, That I might touch  that cheek.
4) 53) dialog: "She speaks. Oh speak again bright angelВ…" We have abandoned real time. The scene continues CROSS  CUT between the STAGE and VIOLA'S BED. INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING.
4) 58) dialog: (below)
4) 59) text: "Shall I hear more or shall I speak at  this?" INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. WILL and VIOLA in bed.
4) 61) dialog: "В…By a name I know not how to tell  thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is  hateful to myself Because it is an  enemy to theeВ…" We see that a group of the other actors have drifted "out front," drawn by the scene. FENNYMAN is there entranced.  Clearly, this stuff is a cut above the normal.
4) 64) dialog: "Alack, there lies more peril in thine  eye, Than twenty of their swords! Look  thou but sweet, And I am proof against  their enmity."
4) 66) dialog: I have night's cloak to hide me from  their eyes; And but thou love me, let  them find me here. INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. WILL and VIOLA are both out of bed, halfway though  dressing. Still rehearsing.

4) 120) dialog: (sobered)
4) 125) dialog: Sunday! Greenwich!
5) 4) dialog: What will you have me do? Marry you  instead?
5) 6) text: To be the wife of a poor player?--can I  wish that for Lady Viola, except in my  dreams? And yet I would, if I were  free to follow my desire in the harsh  light of day.
5) 7) dialog: (tartly)
5) 10) dialog: You cannot, Wessex will kill you
5) 12) dialog: (now fixing her hair)
5) 14) text: Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart  belongs to you but as Viola the river  divides us, and I will marry Wessex a  week from Saturday.
6) 3) text: By heaven, I will drag her down, by  the Queen's command And is cut off short as VIOLA'S door opens at the top of  the stairs.
6) 4) dialog: Good morning, my lord!
6) 6) text: Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no  man, but I swear it would wait for  you! VIOLA comes down the stairs. Behind her WILL appears  gowned and bonneted. He has also assumed a country  accent.
6) 18) text: The Queen asks for you. Answer well. The LORD IN WAITING ushers VIOLA through the crowd. WILL  starts to follow. WESSEX takes him by the arm.
6) 27) text: That dog! ANGLE on the QUEEN. The LORD IN WAITING has presented VIOLA. VIOLA speaks  from a frozen curtsey.
6) 28) dialog: Your Majesty.
6) 31) dialog: (agreeing)
6) 34) dialog: Your Majesty
6) 36) dialog: I love theatre. To have stories acted  for me by a company of fellows is  indeed
6) 38) text: They are not acted for you, they are  acted for me. VIOLA remains silent, in apology. ANGLE on WILL. He is watching and listening. He has never seen the QUEEN so close. He is fascinated.
6) 40) dialog: And I love poetry above all.
6) 45) dialog: (blurts)
6) 47) dialog: I meanВ…Your Majesty, they do not, they  have not, but I believe there is one  who can
6) 55) text: So--the fireworks will be soothing  after the excitements of Lady Viola's  audience. (and now she is next to  WESSEX who is bowing low.  Intimately to him)
7) 12) dialog: Will! What--?
7) 28) dialog: (looking around guardedly. To  WILL)
7) 35) dialog: Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
7) 42) text: You are welcome to my best house!  Here's to the Admiral's Men! Everybody drinks. VIOLA drinks too. She decides too. She  decides to enjoy it. She bangs down her glass.
7) 43) dialog: (shouts)
7) 46) text: IВ…quite liked it. VIOLA, bright eyed, is banging her glass on the table in  time to a song which is being drunkenly delivered by a  barbershop quartet of actors. FENNYMAN reels into VIOLA.
7) 48) dialog: (baffled)
7) 71) dialog: It is not my riding day, my lord.
7) 73) dialog: I am going to church.
7) 76) dialog: It is to be expected on a Sunday.
7) 78) dialog: (cannot take this in)
7) 81) dialog: (faintly)
7) 84) text: Killed last night, in a tavern! Come,  then, we'll say a prayer for his soul VIOLA gives a silent cry. The NURSE is speaking to her in distress.
7) 88) text: Spare me! The CHOIR continues to sing, but the scream brings VIOLA  to her senses and she runs to a side door where WILL is  leaving. EXT. CHURCH. DAY. Outside, VIOLA sees WILL, staggering away from the  church. She calls his name.
7) 89) dialog: Will! He does not answer. She runs after him.
7) 90) dialog: Oh, my love, I thought you were dead! She claps him to her. They told each other for a moment  then WILL pulls back.
7) 93) dialog: You never spoke so well of him.
7) 95) dialog: You lie. WILL turns to look at her.
7) 96) dialog: You lie in your meadow as you lied in  my bed.
7) 98) dialog: Calf love. I loved the writer, and  gave up the prize for a sonnet.
7) 102) dialog: (declaring herself)
7) 106) dialog: You were not dead before. When I  thought you dead, I did not care about  all the plays that will never come,  only that I would never see your face.  I saw our end, and it will come.
7) 108) dialog: If not Wessex the Queen will know the  cause and there will be no more Will  Shakespeare. They kiss again, passionately.
7) 110) dialog: (through his kisses)
7) 124) text: Yes--it will serve. But there's a scene  missing between marriage and death. WILL is still staring at VIOLA. Aware, suddenly, of the  others watching, she breaks his gaze and drops her head.  WILL looks at NED. INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING. WILL and VIOLA. VIOLA dressed as THOMAS. He has present  for her--a neatly written manuscript of his play, on  sheets folded to octavo size.
7) 127) dialog: Will you read it for me?
7) 130) dialog: (reading)
7) 131) text: "It was the lark, the herald of the  morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what  envious streaks Do lace the severing  clouds in yonder east. Night's candles  are burnt out, and jocund day Stands  tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I  must be gone and live, or stay and  die." The words of the scene become WILL'S and VIOLA'S, their  way of saying the farewells they cannot utter.
7) 134) dialog: "I have more care to stay than will to  go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet  wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's  talk. It is not day." By now, her loosened bosom-bandage has been pulled away  and WILL passionately embraces her nakedness.  And into this heaving composition comes a little white  mouse, unseen my them, climbing through a knot hole in  the planking behind VIOLA'S head.  An adjacent knot hole reveals a human eye and we do not  need to be told it is JOHN WEBSTER'S.  WEBSTER takes his eye away from the peephole, and frowns, thinking it out. EXT. ALLEWAY. DAY. TILNEY puts a coin in WEBSTER'S hand.
7) 174) text: For lewdness and unshamefacedness! For  displaying a female on the public  stage! TILNEY is unstoppable. He jumps on the stageВ…and seizes  SAM GOSSE. Before WEBSTER or anyone can intervene, TILNEY pulls up his skirt, ignoring SAM'S rather gutteral yell  of protest and pulls down SAM'S drawers.  TILNEY'S face is a study. So is everybody else's. WEBSTER rolls his eyes (oh, these stupid grown-ups!) and deftly  throws one of his mice onto "ROMEO'S" hair. VIOLA gives a shrill scream, the startled mouse descends her neck via  VIOLA'S ear, and seeks an entry into her collar. By which time VIOLA has gone berserk and torn off her wig. Her  hair is pinned up but there is no question her gender.  WILL is paralysed. VIOLA gives him a look of terrible  despair and apology.
7) 176) text: Not him. (pointing at VIOLA)
7) 182) dialog: (hoping to protect WILL)
7) 185) text: He did! I saw him kissing her bubbies! Everybody looks at WILL, who stares at VIOLA, helpless.
7) 189) dialog: I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted  to be an actor. (she turns to WILL)
7) 190) text: I am sorry, Will. WILL shakes his head. This cannot be the end. VIOLA walks away, leaving by the public entrance. They all let her  go, watching her silently. As she passes WABASH
7) 192) dialog: Thank you. As she is leaving, WILL comes to life. He starts off  towards herВ…but his progress is halted by a sock to the  jaw from NED ALLEYN. WILL falls down in the dust.  FENNYMAN enters, still bent over his sheet of paper,  mumbling his precious lines. When he reaches the  groundlings yard, he finds to his surprise the whole  COMPANY is standing about in attitudes of despair or  worse. FENNYMAN looks around.
7) 220) dialog: Good morning, my lord. I see you are  open for business so let's to church. EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY. WILL is running across the grass towards the house. As he crosses the bridge over the moat, a carriage bears down  on him, and he has to flatten himself against the wall of the gatehouse as the carriage passes, taking WESSEX and  his bride to church. WILL'S face, as he watches the  carriage disappear. Distant bells begin to peal EXT. CHURCH DOOR. DAY. The bells announce the completion of the marriage--as  WESSEX and the new LADY WESSEX leave the church. VIOLA'S  veil is flying in the wind, and beneath it we can just  see VIOLA'S unhappy face. The DE LESSEPS FAMILY entourage is applauding. WESSEX beams with satisfaction.  Suddenly the sky and the wind deliver a message--a flyer  from the Curtain slaps against WESSEX'S face. He claws at it and tries to throw it away. The wind delivers it to  VIOLA'S bosom. She takes it up and reads it. And passes  it to the NURSE.  WESSEX descends the steps to where the curtained carriage awaits the bride and groom. He gallantly holds the door  for VIOLA to enter. She climbs aboard. WESSEX makes to  follow her.
7) 268) dialog: (turning)
7) 271) dialog: What happened to Sam?
7) 273) dialog: Thomas Kent! Their whispers are causing black looks and hushing noises from the neighbours. HENSLOWE pulls VIOLA from her seat,  luckily an aisle seat.
7) 275) dialog: (showing the manuscript)
7) 282) dialog: "How now, who calls?"
7) 284) dialog: "Madam. I am here, what is your will? INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY. There is a collective gasp. Nobody has ever seen a BOY  PLAYER like this. INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY. WILL takes his hands from his ears, and turns round in  amazement at the sound of VIOLA'S voice. INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY. WESSEX has just arrived in the auditorium and jumps as if he has been shot. He seems about to intervene, but  looking around at the rapt faces he realises he cannot. INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY. HENSLOWE and BURBAGE look at each other.
7) 300) dialog: "Art thou gone so? WILL stops.
7) 301) dialog: Love, lord, ay husband, friend, I must  hear from thee every day in the hour,  For in a minute there are many days.  O, by this count I shall be much in  years Ere I again behold my RomeoВ…" WILL as "ROMEO" seems unable to speak. Then he says:
7) 303) dialog: "O think'st thou we shall ever meet  againВ…? Methinks I see thee, now thou  art so low, As one dead in the bottom  of a tomb. Either my eyesight fails,  or thou lookest pale."
7) 315) dialog: "В…Where is my lord? I do remember well where I should be, And there I am.  Where is my Romeo?" INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.
7) 318) dialog: "What here? A cup clos'd in my true  love's hand? Poison, I see, hath been  his timeless end." INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY. "JULIET" takes "ROMEO'S" dagger.
7) 319) dialog: "В…O happy dagger This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die." She stabs herself and dies. The "inner curtain" closes  over the tomb. INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY. HIGH ANGLE on audience and stage. "THE PRINCE" played by  WABASH is having the last word.
7) 355) text: My Lady Wessex? VIOLA nods, heartbroken too. For a long moment they  cannot say anything to each other. The she holds up  Wessex's purse.
7) 356) dialog: A hired player no longer. Fifty  pounds, Will, for the poet of true  love.
