7) 136) dialog: I hope we work together again. Tilney  walks away. EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY. A man is pacing up and down, in a sort of agony. He is  muttering. He is glancing at a sheet of paper. He is  FENNYMAN rehearsing the important role of the Apothecary, for which he has a special voice.
7) 155) text: Oh God, I am free of it! WESSEX gets to his feet. TILNEY enters the auditorium  from the public entrance.
7) 157) dialog: My Lord Wessex!
7) 159) text: Close it! Take it down stone by stone!  I want it ploughed into the ground,  and sown with quick lime! WESSEX storms out past the bewildered TILNEY.

WEBSTER rolls his eyes (oh, these stupid grown-ups!) and deftly  throws one of his mice onto "ROMEO'S" hair.

Her  hair is pinned up but there is no question her gender.  WILL is paralysed. VIOLA gives him a look of terrible  despair and apology.
