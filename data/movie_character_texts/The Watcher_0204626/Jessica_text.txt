92) 0) text: Most of the interior walls have been torn down on the top floor of this abandoned, turn-of-the century office tower leaving a wide-open space that makes for a great moonlit playground for Jessica and her skater friend. He stands on his skateboard holding her hands as she runs, pulling him in and out of the support beams slalom style.

Campbell loses it, running wildly up to the cop and grabbing his fliers and chasing down the businessman, and spinning him around roughly.

106) 0) text: Campbell, Hollis and the kid burst through the stairwell and onto the seventh floor (where we last saw Jessica). A shadow passes the light ahead. Campbell stops short and puts a hand on the kid's chest. Hollis immediately pulls the boy back into the stairwell. Campbell moves quickly, gun drawn, down the main corridor toward the direction he saw the shadow. He fires FIVE SHOTS instinctively as Griffin leaps from the darkness and into the stairwell.
114) 0) text: A DOZEN or so COPS and FEDS work the crime scene. Campbell crouches next to Jessica's bloody body, her face etched with death. He looks into her eyes for a long moment then lowers his head in a gesture that suggests a very deep surrender.
