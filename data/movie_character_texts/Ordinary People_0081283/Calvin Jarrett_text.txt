75) 60) dialog: In the car, I was thinking: "be clear.". I suppose that's what psychiatry's about. Being precise and clear. And honest, of course. I'll level with you. I'm not a great believer in psychiatry.
75) 64) dialog: I know what happens here is only between you and him, and...I like that, I respect that. And...he's better, I can see that. I am not trying to put you down, I just don't believe in psychiatry as a panacea for everybody.

75) 69) dialog: I wish I knew what the hell I was doing here.
75) 82) dialog: I don't know actually, I'm not sure, I think I meant in terms of Conrad. You see, I knew something was wrong even before he tried to... to kill himself. But I thought that... It's clear that he's very smart. He's been an "A" student ever since he started school, and naturally I thought that ...intelligent people could work out their own problems.
75) 86) dialog: Yeah, sure I do. It's hard not to. It was luck. It was just luck that I happened to be there when he tried it. I could have been at a meeting. We both could've been away. It was luck!
75) 90) dialog: No! No. No. I used to. I used to think... that I was a lucky person... before... the "accident". Mmm, I guess the whole of life is nothing but an accident, is it? What happens to you. I should do with it.

75) 98) dialog: Something. I gotta do something about it. I don't know what.
75) 108) dialog: Yeah... No. I don't know. I see her not being able to forgive him.
75) 112) dialog: Oh, I don't know exactly. Being too much like her. People always think that she and Buck are... were ...were alike. But it's really she and Conrad. They were the only two that didn't cry at the funeral, you know? It's not easy for me to admit this but, uh... she didn't... His mother doesn't show him a great deal of affection. I'm not trying to put her down in any way at all. She is a wonderful woman, huh...
75) 116) dialog: Oh, god, yes, she loved Buck! Bucky got so much... I think what she felt for him was special. You know, he was her first-born. That's not unusual, is it?
75) 120) dialog: Me?    I   loved Buck.
75) 124) dialog: For me you mean?
75) 137) dialog: Mmm. She's very... No. There's no problem with her for me. We've been... We've been married nearly twenty one years. Everybody loves Beth. But, huh... for Conrad, - it's been difficult. He didn't talk about that? We don't know what happens here. It doesn't come up. I guess that's what it is. It's private here. Isn't it?

76) 33) dialog: When I was getting dressed for Buck's funeral, I was...
76) 37) dialog: Just let me get it off my chest,OK?
76) 41) dialog: I was wearing a blue shirt. And you said: - Wear a white shirt and the other shoes! It was nothing at the time. But it's always seemed to stay with me. And I, for some reason, been thinking about it and it suddenly occured to me what difference did it make what I wore at Buck's funeral?
76) 46) dialog: Just hear me out, Beth! It won't hurt you to listen!
76) 59) dialog: I just want to talk about something I always remembered.
76) 63) dialog: Because I've always wondered, in some needling way, what it mattered what I wore. I was crazy that day. We were going to our son's funeral. And you were worried about what I wore on my feet. I'm sure it sounds like nothing to you, but it sticks with me and I just wanted to ...tell you about it.
79) 5) dialog: I don't think so. I think we should go see him, Beth. - Dr. Berger.
79) 10) dialog: I think we could all go and see him together.
79) 14) dialog: He thinks it's a good idea.
79) 27) dialog: Exactly. That's the point. Wouldn't it be easier if we all talked about it? In the open.
79) 31) dialog: Darling, that is what this is for. Maybe you'll get a surprise.
79) 35) dialog: I am not asking you to be perfect, you're missing the point.

146) 64) dialog: Jesus, what have I done to make you so angry with me?
146) 77) dialog: Can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you?
146) 81) dialog: Well, stop being so godamn honest, and start being a little generous! And start thinking about him for a while!
146) 85) dialog: Well, I'll tell you what he expects!
146) 89) dialog: All he wants... All he wants is to know you don't hate him. That's it.
146) 93) dialog: I just try to keep this family together...
146) 115) text: She leaves. Calvin follows. Ward and his wife just stand there.
