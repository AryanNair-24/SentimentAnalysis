Chick This thing definitely doesn't like us.  CHUNKS OF THE ASTEROID, some as big as trucks, others as houses, dislodge  from the ASTEROID SURFACE and, slowly a but with terrifyingly increasing  speed and momentum..... .... they start rolling.  HARRY AND THE GUYS just stand there, disbelieving what th seeing.  On come the ROCKS and ICE CHUNKS, rolling. As they hit sm surface rocks,  they take little hops, and bigger hops, u they are BOUNDING across the  surface. Harry lashes A.J.' to the Armadillo.  Harry and the guys run for their lives.  In the midst of this --  -- A 500 FOOT HIGH GEYSER erupts next to the drilling hol gets blasted  by the geyser, which blows him across the a floor, SLAMMING him into the  parked Armadillo. A BOULDER at Pitts and squashes him against the  ARMADILLO , killin A 20 FOOT ICE BOULDER rolls toward A.J.'s SAFETY TETHER.  A.J., suspended 70 feet off the asteroid surface, looks d the ONCOMING ICE  BOULDER. A.J., terrified, tries to unbu tether, but he can't in time.  The boulder hits A.J.'s tether, rolling over it, flatteni the asteroid  surface, which causes --  --A.J., with a JOLT, to be yanked toward the surface. A.J scrambles with his  safety harness.  Chick, next to the Armadillo, sees A.J.'s plight. He dive inside, engages the  gears. The Armadillo ROARS toward th oncoming ICE BOULDER.  A.J., terrified, continues to descend as --  Chick, driving the Armadillo, rams the ICE BOULDER just a about to roll  over A.J. The boulder hops up, SMASHES dow Armadillo's hood, CRUSHING  the steel compartment around and gently rolls over onto --  A.J., who log-rolls under the Armadillo, as the ice bould WHOMPS down and  keeps rolling.

But we need two peo fly this mother back. So, we either all stay or you guys Sharp raises a BUNDLE OF ELECTRICAL WIRES in his hand. Th going to draw  straws. The highest tension yet.

A.J. stares at the two strands. Gets used to the idea. He and begins to  pull. Stops. Chooses the other strand. And It is SHORT. A.J. stares at  the SHORT STRAND OF WIRE in hand. We see a fear on his face that gets  covered by a s smile.  A.J. Well, I guess I won. Now I'm the guy who gets to sav Earth.  A.J. takes off the half medallion. Harry takes off his ha medallion.  A.J. We said we'd join these after we drilled the hole. I ain't gonna be  on Earth.  They slide the two halves together to make a whole. Harry A.J. exchange a  long look.
