CAMERA MOVES IN past Clayton as out of the dark cavity behind Sylvia comes a hand that is more than a hand, on an arm that is thin, lean, with degenerate muscu- lature. Thick veins cross it, pulsating. Back of it is a dim form. The hand-shape has three fingerlike suckers. They fasten on Sylvia's shoulder, spreading, huge. Her eyes and mouth open in horror. She tries to scream but her vocal cords are paralyzed, shocked. She is drawn back, drops the loose beam. Then she forces a SOUND between her lips.
