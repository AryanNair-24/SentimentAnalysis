The SHOT WIDENS and CAMERA PANS with Clayton to people standing near the door. Light in the church comes from kerosene lamps and candles placed wherever they will stand - on pew-ends, window-ledges. CAMERA FOLLOWS Clayton, as he looks anxiously about. The congregation is a scattered gathering of distressed humanity. Those who couldn't run - children, cripples, the sick, aged - and those who felt it was useless to run. They make groups and clusters in the aisles and benches and pews. The church is full of quiet movement - first-aid for the injured, water for the faint, comforting children, soothing babies. The VOICE OF the MINISTER is lifted in prayer. Mumbled 'Amens' join, above the RUMBLE of destruction, growing with the Martian advance. MINISTER'S VOICE (0.s.) We humbly beseech Thy divine guidance, © Lord. Deliver us from the fear which has come upon us - the evil that draws ever nearer - from the terror that will soon knock at the very door of this, Thy house. We pray Thee, Lord - grant us the miracle of Thy divine intervention.... Clayton begins to back out. A Deacon catches his arm. 283a.
