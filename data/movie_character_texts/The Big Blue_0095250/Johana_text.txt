She looks through the window; all she sees is white. It is clear that she was not the one who decided on this trip.  Reading the key phrases from a beat-up note book, she calls upon an old Peruvian.
20) 1) dialog: (in Spanish)
20) 2) text: Is this the Lago del Demonio? (Es bien aqui el Lago del Demonio) ... Huacracocha? The old man goes into a long, rambling explanation. JOHANA nods without understanding a thing.

A man, FRANK, bundled in a parka, comes out of a snowmobile parked by the station, and walks up to the train.

23) 0) text: The storm is at its peak.  The frozen snowmobile plows along side the lake HUACRACOCHA and stops in front of a cluster of quonset huts almost completely buried in snow. FRANK gets the bags out of the back.  The suitcases are b now frozen stiff.  JOHANA follows in his steps. A couple of llamas are huddled up against the hut in attempt to protect themselves from the storm. JOHANA is bewildered.  Shacks in the middle of the Andes, the lake of the "Demon", and now llama that have to be pushed aside to enter one's home. As FRANK opens the door, a man is leaving the hut.  The man is JACQUES MAYOL.  JOHANA and JACQUES pass each other in slow motion.  Everything seems suddenly suspended: time, sound, cold... JACQUES MAYOL instantly makes an impression on her.  He i now 34, still dark-haired, with dark eyes.  He is wearing a red diving suit and a pair of round goggles.  He looks like some legendary creature one would dream about. Everything finally regains its formal speed.  The door slams, the man is gone.  She and FRANK are in the middle of the entrance hall.  JOHANA hasn't yet gotten over the vision she has just had, but she regains composure and enters the next room.
24) 0) text: JOHANA happily takes her gloves off. FRANK puts down the bags and walks into the next room. It's a sort of laboratory, filled with ultra modern equipment. A big bay window overlooks the lake on which is built a long wooden dock. Sitting in a corner, an old Peruvian man is preparing hot drinks.  JOHANA drops into a chair.
24) 2) dialog: Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
24) 5) dialog: ... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles? FRANK smiles and pours some whiskey in her tea cup.
24) 9) dialog: Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
24) 11) dialog: The guy in the Halloween suit! LAWRENCE comes in from the other side of the room. He walks straight over to the bay window.
25) 3) text: You should get things moving, you know.  We're out of equipment and we can't do half of our experiments...! Frank, check the program! JOHANA is finally able to speak.
25) 4) dialog: Who... Who is that?
25) 6) dialog: That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake? LAWRENCE turns one last knob.
25) 8) dialog: I'll have to talk to the driver.
25) 10) dialog: (dumbfounded)
25) 13) dialog: But... how is he going to breathe?
25) 17) text: Can you hear the speed at which it's slowing down, it's incredible. LAWRENCE tears off the sheet with the heartbeat measures on it and hands it to JOHANA. JOHANA feels she's on the verge of crying, and can't figure it out.
25) 21) dialog: How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
25) 24) dialog: Why is he doing this?
25) 26) dialog: Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
25) 29) dialog: (afterthought)

26) 6) dialog: (wondering whether he is joking or not)
26) 9) text: Then it was somebody that looked a lot like you... Thank you. JACQUES then turns around and walks toward the huts. JOHANA still hasn't moved, as if petrified by her emotion and the severe cold.  She then walks up to the hole in th ice and peers into the dark water.  She shudders.
27) 0) text: JOHANA emerges from a down sleeping bag.  She's wearing a big sweater and a wool hat.  She is not sleeping. Intrigued by the sound of the snowmobile, she gets up and walks over to the frozen window.  JACQUES and FRANK are loading their luggage onto the snowmobile. Outside, LAWRENCE is saying "Goodbye" to JACQUES.  Unseen JOHANA also waves from behind her curtain.  JACQUES sense something:  he turns around toward the cabin and smiles, waving his hand at JOHANA.  She hides behind the curtain and shyly waves back. JACQUES gets into the snowmobile and drives out of the frame.  We are left with an endless array of snow-caped mountains.

JACQUES is on top of her, his whole bod covered in sweat.  The rumpled sheets and the movements o their bodies suggest the movements of the sea.  ALL SOUND are disproportionate and slightly distorted, they are underwater... ALL JOHANA'S reluctance has vanished.  Both of them act like people who have never felt anything like this before A certain astonishment at the depth of their feeling.  An increasing freedom.  All the muscles of their bodies stretch to their limits. JACQUES, progressively, finds himself disappearing.  His image dissolves point by point... disintegrates into unbroken blue... The effect creates the impression of someone melting, the screen is now totally blue. A thin, HIGH-PITCHED SOUND. From the bottom of the image, a tiny pinpoint starts TOWARD the CAMERA.  It is JACQUES, naked, swimming out of the deep blue ocean toward the light as if he were coming out of a dive.  He comes CLOSER and CLOSER to the CAMERA... Until his head almost touches the lens... A sudden DEAFENING NOISE... and we find JACQUES on top of JOHANA.  He looks down at her, speechless.

134) 9) dialog: Jacques...?
137) 3) dialog: It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
137) 5) dialog: No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water? While JACQUES gets her the water, JOHANA stares at the view.
139) 0) text: JOHANA sits on the little dock in front of the hotel. JACQUES pulls on his fins, looks out into the water. She clutches a stopwatch, ready to set it off. A few yards behind, hidden between two bungalows, ENZO watches them.  JACQUES takes a few deep breaths and dives a few feet underwater. JOHANA starts the stopwatch. ENZO, who sees JACQUES disappear, walks over to JOHANA an sits down beside her.

141) 0) text: JACQUES is in a T-shirt and jeans, rope-sole sandals. JOHANA wears a light white cotton dress.  They both sit o the restaurant's terrace overlooking the sea. Below them, a small boat passes.  In it are baskets fille with sponges.  JACQUES stares at them for a long time.
141) 1) dialog: Do you ever sometimes just stop and think how sweet life can be? A beat.
141) 3) dialog: ... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
141) 6) dialog: Why?
147) 2) text: The heart is going to stop!  The stimulator, quickly. Suddenly, everything collapses for JACQUES.  Sounds disappear.  The image slows down, the light fades. JACQUES only hears his heartbeat, which slows down. His heart stops. Among the crowd around him, he sees JOHANA, fresh, gentle smiling.  Her movements are smooth and slowed down.  She smiles at him, simply.  JACQUES smiles back.  The heart starts again slowly. The image goes back to normal. Sounds multiply (doctors, the panic, etc...) and slowly come back. JACQUES falls unconscious.

154) 2) text: Jacques?  Are you alright?  Answer me!  Are you alright? She jumps down into ENZO'S boat.  He starts the engine. The boat is racing out of the port.  JOHANA yells over th sound of the engine.
