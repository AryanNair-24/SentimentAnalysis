14) 0) text: A beat-up FIAT, towing an equally beat-up trailer, stops. ENZO unfolds out of the driver's seat, like a circus clow emerging from a toy car. The construction SUPERVISOR, an American, wearing a three piece suit, hurries over to him. ENZO has already started undressing.  ROBERTO unloads the diving gear from the trailer.

ENZO inhales steadily, his chest heaving like a bellow. He carefully puts his spectacles inside his shoes, dons his flippers, etc., with his usual flair of suspense. Behind him the SUPERVISOR and other construction workers watch expectantly.  ROBERTO heaves a stone weight into th bay, a cable attached to it plays out from a drum on the pier. ENZO ignoring everyone, grabs the ordinary tire jack, flip-flops over to the now taut cable, the stone has hit bottom.  He takes a deep breath and dives into the bay.
