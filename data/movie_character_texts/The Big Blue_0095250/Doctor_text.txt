The Japanese diver concentrates with such strength that he faints.

The gueuse stops at the level of the underwater platform, just below the diver, who swims over to him in a sea of bubbles from his oxygen bottles.  He asks JACQUES if he i alright, JACQUES nods and gives him a huge smile before swimming off, downwards! The diver realizes and starts after him.
