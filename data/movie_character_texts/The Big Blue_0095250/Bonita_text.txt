She has a scarf over her hair.  She wears a purple leather micro-mini with a ceris halter top and her ruby fingernails are three inches long If she ever actually would get cast in a movie, she'd mak Raquel Welch hide in shame.  Her stage name is BONITA MARIPOSA. ENZO kills the THROTTLE, swings the speedboat into a perfect landing at the dock.  ROBERTO takes the lines.
