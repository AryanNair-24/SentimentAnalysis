2) 2) text: JACQUES touches bottom.  Clamps his legs around a rock to hold himself down.  Unhurried, thoroughly at home, 40 fee under... he opens the plastic bag.  A huge speckled moray eel appears in a hole in the rock, slithers toward him. The carnivore's jaws are bigger than the boy's head. The boy smiles at him.  Pulls a piece of raw meat out of his bag and holds it out.  The eel takes the morsel delicately -- and slithers back into his hole. Gravely, JACQUES takes another morsel out of the bag.

FRANK gets the bags out of the back.  The suitcases are b now frozen stiff.  JOHANA follows in his steps. A couple of llamas are huddled up against the hut in attempt to protect themselves from the storm. JOHANA is bewildered.  Shacks in the middle of the Andes, the lake of the "Demon", and now llama that have to be pushed aside to enter one's home. As FRANK opens the door, a man is leaving the hut.  The man is JACQUES MAYOL.  JOHANA and JACQUES pass each other in slow motion.  Everything seems suddenly suspended: time, sound, cold... JACQUES MAYOL instantly makes an impression on her.  He i now 34, still dark-haired, with dark eyes.  He is wearing a red diving suit and a pair of round goggles.  He looks like some legendary creature one would dream about. Everything finally regains its formal speed.  The door slams, the man is gone.  She and FRANK are in the middle of the entrance hall.  JOHANA hasn't yet gotten over the vision she has just had, but she regains composure and enters the next room.

25) 18) dialog: JACQUES stops his machine by turning one of the handles. He's deep beneath the surface of the frozen lake.  He swims deliberately, carefully into a large tube which is hinged open.

Intrigued by the sound of the snowmobile, she gets up and walks over to the frozen window.  JACQUES and FRANK are loading their luggage onto the snowmobile. Outside, LAWRENCE is saying "Goodbye" to JACQUES.  Unseen JOHANA also waves from behind her curtain.  JACQUES sense something:  he turns around toward the cabin and smiles, waving his hand at JOHANA.  She hides behind the curtain and shyly waves back.

78) 0) text: On the boat, NOVELLI checks his watch.  JACQUES comes out of his room.  He's dressed to dive.  He ignores everyone as he goes down the ladder to the diving platform.  He seems to be in another world.  All sounds coming to him are drowned out.

80) 2) text: The gueuse slides down the cable.  JACQUES hangs on like ribbon in the wind, past a marker, 90 feet down. Above him, the boat disappears from sight. He moves faster and faster... through a sea that looks like a cloudy sky.  The light fades rapidly around him. Below, white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night. JACQUES reaches them in a matter of seconds.  Turns the brakes, brings his machine to a halt, 180 feet down. The medics are waiting for him there.  They take his pulse.  Check his eyes... 15 seconds... normal... the bubbles from there scuba tanks churn the water around them... JACQUES closes his eyes... a tap on the shoulder, he releases the brake on the gueuse.  Plunges further, this time into pitch black. Below him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom.  He reaches it and the dark diver moves to him.  JACQUES brakes his machine.  Moving very slowly, turns his body right side up.  Like a sleep walker, JACQUES starts to take the plaque off the plumbline... pauses in the middle of the gesture. The dark diver flashes the high sign to JACQUES, thumb an forefinger touching, fingers extended, all clear.  JACQUE does not respond.  The diver repeats the signal.  JACQUES does not respond. The diver taps JACQUES on the shoulder... a beat... and then JACQUES responds, thumb and forefinger touching okay Slowly, reluctantly, he wraps his hand around the handle of the balloon. The dark diver quickly turns the handle for him.  The balloon inflates.  JACQUES hangs on... lets it carry him up. At the plague marking 210 feet, JACQUES lets go of the th balloon.  With a burst of speed, it darts toward the surface. JACQUES follows slowly, undulating like a fish... He's getting warm now... He closes his eyes. Passes the medical control without stopping... without even seeing it like someone asleep. He's moving faster now, toward the warmth, toward the air JACQUES opens his eyes, watches the lights grow brighter. The silhouette of the boat comes back into view.  60 feet to go.

Everybody applauds.

JACQUES is on top of her, his whole bod covered in sweat.  The rumpled sheets and the movements o their bodies suggest the movements of the sea.  ALL SOUND are disproportionate and slightly distorted, they are underwater... ALL JOHANA'S reluctance has vanished.  Both of them act like people who have never felt anything like this before A certain astonishment at the depth of their feeling.  An increasing freedom.  All the muscles of their bodies stretch to their limits. JACQUES, progressively, finds himself disappearing.  His image dissolves point by point... disintegrates into unbroken blue... The effect creates the impression of someone melting, the screen is now totally blue. A thin, HIGH-PITCHED SOUND. From the bottom of the image, a tiny pinpoint starts TOWARD the CAMERA.  It is JACQUES, naked, swimming out of the deep blue ocean toward the light as if he were coming out of a dive.  He comes CLOSER and CLOSER to the CAMERA... Until his head almost touches the lens... A sudden DEAFENING NOISE... and we find JACQUES on top of JOHANA.  He looks down at her, speechless.

132) 1) text: JACQUES dives down very fast.  The control takes place at 200 feet, the doctors check him and let him go.  He continues his descent, it's getting darker and darker around him. The gueuse stops at the level of the underwater platform, just below the diver, who swims over to him in a sea of bubbles from his oxygen bottles.  He asks JACQUES if he i alright, JACQUES nods and gives him a huge smile before swimming off, downwards! The diver realizes and starts after him.

135) 7) dialog: Do you really understand me?  Huh? Are we actually having a conversation here? Again the dolphin nods "yes".

139) 18) text: A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?

145) 12) dialog: JACQUES pulls himself down the cable, hand over hand. 80 or 90 feet down he sees a group of MEDICS coming towar him carrying ENZO'S unconscious body. JACQUES struggles with them, pushes them away, takes ENZO in his arms and climbs toward the surface, frantic, screaming silently at him, desperate to get away from the flow of air bubbles from the scuba tanks, the commotion, the memory of death. ENZO has a big serene smile on his face.  The MEDICS push both divers toward the surface. As if they were on land, JACQUES starts shaking ENZO to wake him up.

JACQUES only hears his heartbeat, which slows down. His heart stops. Among the crowd around him, he sees JOHANA, fresh, gentle smiling.  Her movements are smooth and slowed down.  She smiles at him, simply.  JACQUES smiles back.  The heart starts again slowly. The image goes back to normal. Sounds multiply (doctors, the panic, etc...) and slowly come back. JACQUES falls unconscious.

The noise is unbearable The ceiling turns into water. JACQUES' eyes are wide open.  His face is sweating.  The water level, from the ceiling, comes down to him, until h is swallowed by it. As he falls into the water, we see a dolphin gulping air at the surface and going back very quickly to the blue. The dolphin meets his group, about ten of them, 250 Kg of muscles, swimming at more than 40 km/H underwater.  They all break through the surface to gulp air regularly. Suddenly, one of them, leaves the group.  He crosses the blue and seems to make sonar-like sounds.  We see a sonar picture.  It's an image in which the dolphin will appear few seconds later.  The dolphin comes up like a rocket, gulps air and goes back down. The sonar image appears again.  Finally, the dolphin, locates a group of fish and starts hunting them, exactly like a war plane.  He manages to break the group in two, then in four, and this way, he isolates his victim. He breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down.  He goes full power.  The fish he is after are even more divided.  There is only one left, totally lost and in a panic. The exhausted fish is swallowed. The dolphin slows down, goes back up, breaks the surface in slow motion.  Images becomes pale and bright. He screams inhumanly. Image is white, black, silence.

He throws down the diving cable:  60, 90 120 feet... JACQUES gets undressed and sits down in the lotus position, concentrating... JOHANA sits down a few feet away and watches him, wondering just how far he is going to push this whole thing. As the cable unrolls, JOHANA starts crying.  She understands that JACQUES is going to dive to the bottom, into the blue, into himself.

A dolphin comes and presses its body against it.  Two other dolphins come out of the night.  JACQUES watches in amazement. A dolphin lays his muzzle in JACQUES' hand, ready to lead him off.  JACQUES hesitates. JACQUES lets go of the cable and lets himself be led away Their silhouettes disappear in the deep blue night.
