143) 12) dialog: Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If  nothing is going to change, I'd just  as soon it not change in the way it  hasn't been changing all this time.
143) 15) dialog: Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this  land? Some sort of midlife crisis?  Instead of buying a convertible, you  buy a town?
143) 18) dialog: I'm not convinced you should be happy.

153) 6) dialog: People aren't like they are in  stories. They hurt each other without  meaning to. They are kind and  unbelievably cruel at the same moment.  Like me, now. I'm not sure I should  have told you any of this.
153) 9) text: A long beat, both staring at their iced tea. Jenny is wor herself into more of a state by not talking.
153) 10) dialog: I wanted to meet you for the longest  time. I did. (a smile) I envied you so much. The way Eddie  would talk about you when you were  at Missouri, that award you won.  Congratulations, incidentally. And  when you got the job at the A.P.,  everything, he was so proud of you.  I mean, that's the thing. Every moment  he loved you.
153) 12) dialog: And as brightly as the sun would  shine when he was with me, every  time he left it disappeared. I wanted  to be as important to him as you  were, and I was never going to be. I  was make-believe and his other life,  you, were real.
153) 14) dialog: You knew that, didn't you?
175) 4) text: The crowd CHEERS. The Ashton marching band PLAYS. Jenny H smiles. So does the Old Woman. We PUSH IN on the Old Woman's glass eye, where we see...
