52) 11) dialog: Who lies? By night's end I predict me and her will...interface. Cliff and Bryce stare at the Geek as if he's just told hi he's going to walk on water.
52) 12) dialog: Check it out. The Geek cools up his hair and heads for Sam. Cliff and Bryce watch for a moment, then slip on a personal radio communicator of the variety SWAT teams and football coach use.
53) 7) dialog: 
53) 8) dialog: (cool and confident) Awright! I knew you'd come around. He yanks her out on the dance floor. Keeping one hand firmly in hers, he does a moon dance. Sam is stunned and speechless at yet another tragedy in her life.
53) 9) dialog: (looking over his shoulder to DJ) Crank it, sister!
53) 11) dialog: The Geek ducks the record and throws his head back. He lets out a spirited yelp.

53) 13) dialog: What's the matter?
53) 15) dialog: He thinks Sam's crying tears of happiness. He gives her his idea of a sexy smile.
53) 16) dialog: I'm blowing your mind, aren't I? He executes an embarrassing spin and lets out a liberated shriek.

53) 21) dialog: I'm...okay, babe.
56) 0) text: The Geek limps back to the Weenie Wall. Cliff and Bryce chide him about losing Sam.
56) 2) dialog: Don't you know anything about girls? They get hyper when you come on hard. I told you I'd interface with her and Iwill. She grabbed me, dog lips. Don't worry. The situation will come on-line. Don't spaz-out, weasel.
56) 4) dialog: You got a bet, scumbag. I'll get it all.
56) 7) dialog: I'm sorry, man. Whatever I did was an accident.
56) 10) dialog: I'm sorry. I totally lost my head. I must have been on drugs.
56) 12) dialog: She grabbed me, guy. I'm totally innocent. Is she yours? Jake shakes his head. The Geek breathes a sigh of relief.
56) 14) dialog: She's kind of quiet. Weenie-tits but anything more than a mouthful's a waste. Good face, decent voice, smells pretty good, drives me schizo. I'm an old poon dog though, so anything with four legs and a tail makes me go ape-shit.
56) 16) dialog: No, but if it's okay with my dad, she's going home with me. Jake nods and walks away. The Geek feels like a million bucks. He continues across the gym. On his way, he passes Dong who's slow dancing to a rocker with a six foot, two inch girl, The Lumberjack. She's stocky and tough, wearin painter's pants, a flannel shirt and black hightops. Dong lovingly rests his head on her huge breast as they dance. He reaches his hand out of the neck of her shirt and push his glasses up on his nose. 83 84 85

63) 8) dialog: I'm back. Sam looks at him wearily.
63) 10) dialog: That's my shave cream. Wanna feel a clean, close shave?
63) 12) dialog: You're the one I want to bug.
63) 14) dialog: Howdy, dude.
63) 16) dialog: My name's Ted.
63) 18) dialog: I'm not a farmer. I work at ComputerLand. Jimmy's totally disinterested. Randy feels sorry for Sam.
63) 20) dialog: Not if you're going to insult me.
63) 25) dialog: Shoot.
63) 27) dialog: Nice manners. Jimmy looks around Randy to the Geek.
63) 29) dialog: Okay. Fine. Don't freak. (to Sam, with his eye on his buddies across the gym) You wanna split with me?
63) 31) dialog: I just thought I'd...Huh?! Sam stands. The Geek rises slowly.
64) 0) text: He watches Sam and the Geek exit. He's curious and a little confused.
64) 4) dialog: (concerned) What's wrong? You didn't get anything good?
64) 6) dialog: I'd freak if my family forgot my birthday. Sam stretches out on the hood.
64) 9) dialog: You're frigid? Sam stares blankly at him. Appalled at his nerve.
64) 14) dialog: I'm fairly knowledgeable about the female reproductive organs if you want to shoot me a question.
64) 16) dialog: (nervously) Would you feel better if you knew one of my secrets?
64) 18) dialog: We're not talking gross. Just embar- rassing. The Geek clears his throat and scratches his ear. He steels himself and boldly reveals his secret.
64) 19) dialog: (dead serious) I've never had sexual intercourse. Sam stares at him for a beat, then lets out a horse laugh She can't help herself. It's so obvious he's a virgin.
64) 20) dialog: (laughs) I knew you wouldn't believe me. Sam howls with laughter.
64) 24) dialog: (crosses his heart) I swear to God. I've never even had hand contact. Sam manages to control herself. She wipes her nose on her sleeve and shakes out her hair.
64) 25) dialog: I appreciate your not laughing at me. Sam bursts into laughter again. The Geek laughs.
64) 26) dialog: That's not what I meant. I meant.... He suddenly takes her in his arms and holds her close. Sh stops laughing. She clears her throat.
64) 28) dialog: Excuse me. He sits back against the windshield, frightened and embarrassed.
64) 29) dialog: I'm really sorry. Sam isn't offended or angry. She's slightly flattered and understands completely how he feels. She realizes his plight isn't too far removed from hers.
64) 36) dialog: You're probably zoning in on my brain waves.
64) 40) dialog: (misunderstands - her) I'm not embarrassed. Fresh breath is a priority in my life. Sam smiles at his honesty and innocence. And his interest
64) 42) dialog: I care about it. I swear to God. I know I come on kind of like an asshole on the bus and tonight but that's mainly just so my friends won't think I'm a dink.
64) 44) dialog: I guess. But I'm kind of the leader. I'm like the King of the Dipshits.
64) 49) dialog: (hopeful) Yeah?
64) 51) dialog: Would it be totally off the wall if I asked if I could have sex with you? Sam sighs and smiles. She nods.
64) 52) dialog: Sorry. I thought so. I know that isn't the standard method guys use to score poon. But I'm like, you know, kind of a rookie.
64) 54) dialog: 
64) 57) dialog: (surprised) You like Jake? Sam's embarrassed.
64) 58) dialog: I just talked to him in the gym. He asked me about you. Sam's mouth drops open. She wonders if she heard the Geek right.
64) 59) dialog: He asked what you were like.
64) 65) dialog: Cross my heart.
64) 67) dialog: I'm not lying! I swear on a stack of Bibles.
64) 70) dialog: This isn't really my department.
64) 72) dialog: Apparently.
64) 74) dialog: I'm a gambling man by nature. I'd go for it.
64) 80) dialog: Wait!
64) 82) dialog: Do you know anything about floppy disks?
64) 84) dialog: Well, I've got kind of a problem. Floppy disks are pretty expensive. And I made a bet... (scared) I bet my friend that I'd do it with you. Sam puts her hands on her hips angrily and stares him dow
64) 85) dialog: This was before I knew you as a person. I told him I'd get proof and I can get it without actually getting physical.
64) 87) dialog: (choked, cracking voice) Could I borrow your underpants for about ten minutes? Sam's eyes open in shock.

111) 6) dialog: Sure.
111) 8) dialog: (flattered) You'd come over to my house?
111) 10) dialog: Sure.
119) 0) text: Jake struggles and grunts to overturn the coffee table.. rolls over on one side and the Geek takes a deep breath o fresh air.
119) 2) dialog: Rock the jock put me inside that thing.
119) 6) dialog: He gave me a choice of that or being handcuffed nude to the shopping cart return rack at the Jewel. I opted for death with dignity. Jake shakes his head in anger.

119) 9) dialog: Your house got eighty-sixed. I'm sorry.
123) 0) text: The Geek is sharing his treasure with Jake. Jake regards the panties with an almost religious reverence.

123) 5) dialog: Oh God, no. She's cranked for you. I told her you asked about her and she freaked.
123) 10) dialog: Girls'll do that, Jake. You see, they know guys are like in perpetual heat. They know this and they enjoy pumping us up. It's pure power politics.
123) 12) dialog: Games, Jake. Silly, torturous games. You know how many times a week I go without lunch because some bitch borrows my lunch money? Any halfway decent girl can rob me because I'm too torqued-up to say no. It's heinous.
123) 14) dialog: Look at it this way, what happens to me if I bullshit you?
123) 16) dialog: Right. So, why would I lie? back on the couch and toys with the panties.
123) 17) dialog: (serious) But I feel compelled to mention that if all you want off her is a piece of ass, I'll do my best to either do it myself or get somebody bigger than me to reach down your throat and squeeze your heart. She's an excellent human being. Not many girls in contemporary American society would give up their underwear to help a weenie like me.
123) 22) dialog: What are you waiting for?
123) 24) dialog: (sexy; macho) Does that really matter, guy?
123) 27) dialog: Oh, hell no. I think a ton of guys feel the same way, only they don't have the balls to admit it. Samantha's a major piece of work. She's nice and she cares.
123) 33) dialog: I'm only a freshman.
123) 35) dialog: I mean, don't have a car.
123) 37) dialog: I don't have a license either.

128) 2) dialog: Cut it out! She turns on the windshield washers. The Geek struggles t turn them off. She hits the convertable top switch and it starts to go up.
128) 3) dialog: Knock it off! You're going to get us in serious trouble! Caroline pops open a can of beer and tries to feed it to the Geek.
128) 6) dialog: (into the phone) Wrong number. As he hangs up the phone, Caroline puts the beer up on th dash and digs a birth control dispenser out of her purse. She holds it up to his face. He pushes it away from without recognizing it.
128) 12) dialog: Yes. Thank you. He takes the pill and pops it in his mouth. Caroline lets out a sharp laugh.
128) 14) dialog: You gave me a birth control pill?! Do you have any idea what estrogen can do to a guy my age?!
130) 0) text: Caroline drops her head in the Geek's lap. His eyes dart back and forth between the road and his lap and Caroline. His concerns about getting in trouble wilt in the heat of Caroline's passion.

135) 6) dialog: That's what the picture's for, fuzz nuts! The Geek hurries around to the driver's side. Cliff fumbles with the camera. The Geek gets in and puts his arm around Caroline. She snuggles up to him.

She plants a sleepy kiss on his chest and open her eyes. Half her hair is missing from the night before.
