46) 12) dialog: (admitting it) It’s a compelling argument. Brilliantly reasoned. These days more women than ever are working. And why not? We have pre-schools and washing machines and cheap contraceptives.
46) 14) dialog: But there’s a glaring problem... In the unlikely event that you win this thing -- what’s the remedy? The Court takes away the Caregiver Deduction from everyone -- including working mothers. And then you've done more harm than good.
46) 18) dialog: I still say I'd rather be a woman in America than a black man. Or a socialist. Or religious minority... But the ACLU will put its name on your brief.
