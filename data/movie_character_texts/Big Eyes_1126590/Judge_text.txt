111) 0) text: The EIGHT JURORS watch attentively. Walter sits with the table of slick Gannett lawyers. The lead lawyer stands in front of the irritable Chinese JUDGE. 100.
111) 5) dialog: How many years back do these go?
111) 7) dialog: This is a very strange case. These paintings hang in museums all over the world, attributed to Mr. Keane. And regardless of the truth, Mrs. Keane has contributed immeasurably to the confusion... The Judge stares off... then makes a decision.
111) 8) dialog: It seems impossible that Gannett's actions would ever meet the legal standard for libel. So -- the charge against them is dismissed.
111) 17) dialog: Mr. Keane, you appear to be without counsel. Would you like a postponement, in order to get your affairs in order? Walter glances over at Margaret. She stifles a laugh. He glares daggers. Then, cocksure, foolhardy, he jumps to feet.
113) 2) dialog: Mr. KEANE! I've told you, you must ask the witness questions! If you're acting as your own attorney, you cannot make statements at this time.
113) 6) dialog: 
113) 22) dialog: (he SLAMS his fist) Overruled!!
113) 25) dialog: HEY! This is not a domestic squabble! Or -- maybe it is. But the rest of us have no interest in watching you two go at it. Walter calms himself, contrite.
113) 27) dialog: Maybe.
114) 8) dialog: The choreography is not necessary. Just sit down and testify. Oh. Walter sits, then gathers his thoughts... We slowly PUSH IN. He smiles, wistfully...
114) 34) dialog: You're done. Walter stops, surprised.
114) 36) dialog: Actually, you are! (he blows his stack) I cannot stomach one more wild tangent or shaggy dog tale. You're not testifying -- you're filibustering! The Federal Courts are overburdened enough, without your docket-clogging nonsense.
114) 40) dialog: NO! It's not a mistrial!! In my opinion, there's only one way to clear up this thicket. You are both going to paint. Walter gasps, stunned. All color drains from his face.
115) 4) dialog: Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece. I don't know much about these things -- I'm a jurist, not an art critic -- but, is one hour enough? Margaret nods: Sure. Shaking, Walter barely moves his head.
115) 5) dialog: Okay then. You've both been provided with identical supplies... so -- without any further business... Mrs. Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours.
115) 11) dialog: Mr. Keane?
115) 15) dialog: 
115) 22) dialog: gapes at Walter, befuddled.
115) 27) dialog: Mr. Keane! Are you all right?
115) 31) dialog: is astonished.
