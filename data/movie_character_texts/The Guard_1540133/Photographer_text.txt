13) 0) text: A DEAD MAN slumped against a wall. Twenties, blond hair. A halo of blood and brain matter about his head from a single bullet wound. Pages from a book stuffed into his mouth. "5 1/2” painted in red on the wall above his head. A pot-plant balanced on his crotch. BOYLE and MCBRIDE survey the scene. A PHOTOGRAPHER taking photos with an archaic camera, the bulb popping.
13) 4) dialog: Sure it’s all good clean fun, Sergeant. I have what I need anyways. He pats his camera and hustles out the door just as BOYLE shapes to give him a kick. MCBRIDE looks puzzled.

87) 9) dialog: A happy ending? Sure didn’t you foil a multi-million-dollar drug-trafficking operation and knock off a trio of drug barons to boot? What’s unhappy about that?
87) 11) dialog: Oh I wouldn’t be too sure about that, now.
87) 13) dialog: They never recovered a body, now, did they?
87) 17) dialog: Maybe so. Sure it’s easy enough to look up, anyways. He turns and strolls off. After a moment, EUGENE and Jasper leave also. EVERETT turns back. Thinks. FLASH on -- BOYLE in the Garda car. (CONTINUED )
