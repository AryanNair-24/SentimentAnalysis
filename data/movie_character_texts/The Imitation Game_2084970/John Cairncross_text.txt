82) 8) dialog: Do you know what they do to homosexuals? You’ll never be able to work again. Never be able to teach. Your precious machine — doubt you’ll ever see him again. ON ALAN: Looks down. He’s beaten. He puts an understanding hand on Alan’s shoulder.
82) 9) dialog: Until the history books are ready to call you a hero, sometimes you have to play the villain. And with that, John takes his bible and leaves. ON ALAN: What’s he going to do?
