35) 3) dialog: Apologies for my tardiness — bus caught a flat tire.
35) 6) dialog: I’m only a few minutes late. With the bombing there’s ten potholes to each road.
35) 9) dialog: I am a candidate.
35) 11) dialog: The letter did not say, precisely.
35) 13) dialog: It said it was top secret.
35) 15) dialog: There was a crossword in the paper. I solved it. I got a letter saying I was a candidate for some mysterious job. So here I am. My name is Joan Clarke. She hands the Agent the LETTER.
35) 17) dialog: What makes you think I couldn’t have solved the puzzle myself? I am quite —
35) 20) dialog: Apologies again for being late. As Joan SITS, the Agent turns to Menzies — who’s been silently observing Alan thus far — for support. Menzies SHRUGS. The Agent backs down. Alan passes out NEW CROSSWORD PUZZLES.
35) 21) dialog: — Pardon, but before we start, can you tell me a bit about this position I’m qualifying for?
35) 23) dialog: It’s just that I’ve a pretty decent job at the University, and I'd rather not give it up for something less interesting.
35) 28) dialog: Yes.
35) 30) dialog: You said to do it in under 6. ON ALAN: The smartest man in the room is surprised for th first time in a very long time by someone who might be ev smarter.
36) 2) dialog: And what is it that we’re really doing?
36) 4) dialog: Well that does sound more interesting than my university job.
42) 2) dialog: ("My parents can hear us”) So kind of you to visit, Mr. Turing. Was your trip pleasant?
42) 4) dialog: I’m sorry. I am unable to accept your offer.
42) 6) dialog: As my father told you, it is felt — well we feel — that such a position would hardly be appropriate.
42) 8) dialog: But sadly was not granted the opportunity to become a Fellow.
42) 11) dialog: 
42) 14) dialog: I’m sorry, but for someone in my position to work - to live - amongst all of your men, so far from home It would be indecorous.
42) 17) dialog: ("I told you they’re listening!”) — One lump or two? Are you fucking serious? Yes. I’m fucking serious. He tries to think of a solution
42) 20) dialog: 
42) 22) dialog: So I would be working amongst these women?
42) 24) dialog: ("Good job.”) Well. I will have to talk this over with my family. As Joan’s parents enter, we
43) 2) dialog: Why are you helping me?
43) 4) dialog: Mr. Turing. Why are you helping me?
49) 1) dialog: (whispering) Could you have made a bit more noise, Alan? Not sure you woke up my landlady.
49) 3) dialog: The best I can do. No male visitors after dark. She watches Alan remove papers from his pockets.
49) 4) dialog: What’d you bring me? Alan produces the Enigma messages from every available hi place on his person.
49) 5) dialog: ++. Some men try flowers, you know.
49) 7) dialog: Or chocolates. Girls like chocolate. 51. Alan starts PLACING THE MESSAGES down on a table, but the isn’t room, so he starts LAYING THEM OUT ON THE FLOOR.
49) 8) dialog: (reading a message) “0600 hours. Weather today is clear. Rain in the evening. Heil Hitler.” Well, clearly that vital information is going to win us the war.
49) 10) dialog: Who’s “Christopher”?
49) 12) dialog: You named him?
49) 14) dialog: Nevermind... (looks over the messages) Are you trying to build your Universal Machine? Alan looks at her: How do you know what that is? Joan smiles.
49) 15) dialog: I read your paper at university.
49) 17) dialog: Oh God no, but I was precocious. You theorized a machine that can solve any problem. It doesn’t just do one thing: It does everything. The machine isn’t only programmable, it’s re-programmable. ON ALAN: She understands what he’s been writing about. 52.
49) 18) dialog: Is that part of the idea behind your Christopher?
49) 20) dialog: (trying out the words on her tongue) A “digital computer?” Hmm.
49) 23) dialog: My landlady. You need to leave.
49) 25) dialog: — No. The window. She’s coming.
49) 27) dialog: Go. 53. Alan AWKWARDLY CLIMBS OUT THE WINDOW, TRYING NOT TO FALL.
52) 1) dialog: I heard about what happened... I have an idea of what might cheer you up.
53) 1) dialog: ++. So because no letter can be encoded as itself, you’ve already a handful of settings that can be rejected at the outset. If you — Just then, Hugh, John, and Peter enter the Beer Hut... ++. Alan looks up, seeing them. Joan notices.
53) 2) dialog: Is that your team? Let’s say hello.
53) 4) dialog: (to the boys) Over here! They see Joan... 56.
53) 6) dialog: Correct. ++. Hugh, John and Peter approach.
53) 9) dialog: He doesn’t, really, he just sort of sips at the foam.
53) 11) dialog: ++. Clarke.
53) 13) dialog: Please.
53) 15) dialog: Well then, I’1l show you a trick. (to Bartender) Alex! We’re in need of supplies. Joan hops behind the bar and the BARTENDER helps her to BOTTLES OF GUINNESS. Hugh, Alan, John and Peter watch.
53) 25) dialog: Did you ever notice that the bubbles in a pint of Guinness travel downwards, as opposed to upwards in any other beer? Ever wonder why? It’s because the pint glass creates drag on the bubbles along the side; but the center bubbles are free to sprint upwards. Then the rising current in the middle pushes down on the side bubbles and... And voila: Guinness. The official beer of mathematicians. ON THE PINTS: Joan has etched pi symbols into the foam.
53) 30) dialog: Hugh was being sarcastic.
53) 32) dialog: We'll be there in a moment. Joan smiles at Hugh as he joins John and Peter at a separ table.
53) 34) dialog: Yes.
53) 36) dialog: Yes.
53) 38) dialog: Because I’m a woman in a man’s job and I don’t have the luxury of being an ass. (beat) Alan, it doesn’t matter how smart you are. Enigma is smarter. If you really want to beat it - if you really want to solve your puzzle — you're going to need all the help you can get. And they are not going to help you if they do not like you. Alan thinks. The next sentence is incredibly hard for him say out loud.
57) 3) dialog: That’s Alan for “thank you.”
62) 19) dialog: Alan? 69. At the sound of her voice, Alan comes out of the wash roo wiping the shaving cream from his face. He’s moving and talking a mile a minute. Joan sits
62) 21) dialog: We should talk. down, sadly.
62) 23) dialog: Alan, I’m leaving.
62) 25) dialog: No. Bletchley.
62) 27) dialog: It’s my parents... I am twenty-five and I am unmarried and I am living alone... And they want me home.
62) 29) dialog: That's my parents.
62) 31) dialog: “T'll miss you.” That’s what a normal person might say in this situation.
62) 33) dialog: “I'll write.” That'd work too. 70.
62) 35) dialog: What am I supposed to do, Alan? I will not give up my parents. The world is burning to ash and they are my family and they want me home.
62) 37) dialog: — And end up like you? No thanks. I’m sorry you're lonely. I’m sorry no one likes you. But Enigma will not save you. Can you decypher that, you fragile narcissist? Or do you need me to fetch your precious Christopher for help? Silence. Alan looks like she just slapped him across the face. Whi she basically did.
62) 38) dialog: I’m sorry.
62) 40) dialog: I know.
62) 42) dialog: I like talking to you, too, Alan.
62) 44) dialog: You have one in mind?
62) 46) dialog: Hugh is terribly attractive, I'll give you that, but he’s really not the marrying type.
62) 48) dialog: Peter? He’s so quiet... Alan stares at Joan. She stares back.
62) 49) dialog: (getting it) Oh dear Lord.
62) 51) dialog: Did you just propose to me?
62) 53) dialog: This is ridiculous.
62) 55) dialog: (trying to process) I cannot believe this is happening. Alan fishes a piece of ELECTRICAL WIRE from his pocket...
62) 57) dialog: Elizabeth.
63) 0) text: An impromptu ENGAGEMENT PARTY in the Beer Hut that night: — A BANNER made from PUNCH CARDS reads: “CONGRATULATIONS! — Music plays as DANCERS TWIRL in the center of the Hut. — Joan LAUGHS with her WREN FRIENDS in one corner, while another Alan drinks beer with his team. ON JOAN AND THE GIRLS: She shows off her makeshift wire engagement ring:
63) 2) dialog: I know it’s not an ordinary ring.. She looks over at Alan warmly.
63) 3) dialog: ++. But who ever loved ordinary? ON ALAN AND THE BOYS: They’re are all a bit drunk, TELLIN
63) 8) dialog: Care for a dance?
63) 20) dialog: Come on, now it’s your turn. She leads him to the dance floor. As they START TO DANCE, chastely, sweetly, WE
68) 1) dialog: 
68) 3) dialog: Hugh? Bit of a cad, actually.
68) 5) dialog: Here, I’1ll introduce you.
68) 7) dialog: Are you sure?
68) 16) dialog: 
68) 18) dialog: Is it odd that when I was single this game felt tedious, but now it seems just dreadfully fun?
68) 28) dialog: He has many. 81.
68) 35) dialog: Helen Stewart, Hugh Alexander.
68) 48) dialog: (to Alan) That’s what flirting looks like. In case you were curious. But Alan is lost in thought... Something is wrong...
70) 1) dialog: Alan? — Hugh, John, and Peter enter as Alan spreads the message out on the floor. (Just like he did in Joan’s flat!)
70) 4) dialog: Like this? (reading aloud) “0600 hours. Weather today is clear. Rain in the evening. Heil Hitler.” 85.
70) 8) dialog: Here’s the 6 o’clock message from this morning. Joan holds the message as they all run out to:
72) 6) dialog: L-H-W-A-U-Q-X-kK... They all stand back as Alan TURNS ON the machine. They watch the CLACK CLACK CLACK of Christopher as he processes the message... — They’re nervous, fretting, anxiously awaiting his calculations... Finally, Christopher STOPS. Silence, as a SERIES OF ROTORS on the side of Christopher snap into place, displaying a SET OF LETTERS.
75) 3) dialog: Oh my good God.
75) 5) dialog: (getting closer to map) There’s going to be an attack on a British passenger convoy. There.
75) 7) dialog: Civilians. Hundreds of them. We can save their lives.
75) 11) dialog: Is there enough time to save them?
75) 22) dialog: Alan, are you all right? What’s going on?
75) 27) dialog: Alan! Hugh can’t take it anymore — — He TAKES A SWING AT ALAN — — Who CRUMPLES AT THE BLOW ON HIS JAW — — Hugh stares down at Alan, who’s bleeding on the floor — — Hugh WINDS UP FOR ANOTHER PUNCH — — When Joan CATCHES HIS ARM mid-swing — — Surprised, Hugh instinctively SWINGS AT HER — — Smacking Joan hard across the face. — He’s stunned by what he’s done as she responds by PUSHI HIM INTO A TABLE — — And Hugh falls to the floor, next to Alan. Joan stands above them.
75) 28) dialog: (to Hugh) If you hurt him, you will just barely live to regret it. Silence. Just the sounds of panting.
75) 34) dialog: (getting it) Oh my God.
75) 37) dialog: Oh my God. Damn it. Alan’s right.
75) 46) dialog: They'll put a halt on radio communication by noon. (MORE )
75) 48) dialog: And they’ll have the design of Enigma changed by the weekend.
75) 55) dialog: What?
75) 59) dialog: What’s gotten into you, Peter?
78) 4) dialog: You'll take care of that.
78) 8) dialog: And then MI-6 can come up with the lies we'll tell everyone else. 95.
78) 10) dialog: A false story that exlains how we got that information, that has nothing to do with Enigma. And then you'll need to leak those stories to the Germans.
78) 12) dialog: Can you do that?
89) 2) dialog: (annoyed) What?
89) 4) dialog: You think it’s safe somewhere else?
89) 6) dialog: Alan. What’s happened? ON ALAN: This isn’t working. He’s going to have to try a different approach.
89) 8) dialog: What is wrong with you?
89) 10) dialog: Alright. ON ALAN: What?
89) 12) dialog: So what?
89) 14) dialog: — So what? I had my suspicions. I always did. But we’re not like other people. We love each other in our own way, and we can still live the life together that we want. You won't be the perfect husband? I can promise you I harboured no intention of being the perfect wife. I’ll not be fixing your lamb all day awaiting your return from the office, will I? I’11 work. (MORE )
89) 16) dialog: You'll work. We’ll have each other’s company. We’ll have each other’s minds. Sounds like a better Marriage than most. Because I care for you. And you care for me. And we understand one another more than anyone else ever has. ON ALAN: He needs to get rid of her, to save her, and she making this impossible.
89) 18) dialog: What?
89) 20) dialog: I am not going anywhere. I have spent entirely too much of my life worried about what you think of me, or what my parents think of me, or what the boys in Hut 8 or the girls in Hut 3 think, and you know I am done with it. This work is the most important thing I will ever do in my life. And no one will stop me. Least of all you. Joan turns to walk away, and then, angry, she turns back. She TOSSES HER WIRE ENGAGEMENT RING AT ALAN.
89) 21) dialog: They were right. John. Hugh. Peter. You really are a monster. Alan watches her walk away, struggling to maintain his fa of icy indifference.
102) 2) dialog: I had to find out from the bloody newspapers.
102) 4) dialog: ++. You never responded to my letters. (silence from Alan) I would have come. I would have testified. Alan tries «+. Which He is. 112.
102) 6) dialog: I would have said something. This is serious. They could send you to jail - to move a glass of water... he DROPS, shattering it.
102) 8) dialog: Your hands... You’re twitching.
102) 10) dialog: Alan.
102) 12) dialog: The medication?
102) 14) dialog: What are you talking about?
102) 16) dialog: Oh my god. Oh my god. That’s —
102) 18) dialog: All right. This is what we’re going to do. I’m going to speak to your doctors. I’m going to speak to your lawyer. We’re going to find a way out of this.
102) 20) dialog: You are not thinking clearly. There are a million chemicals flowing through your brain. This treatment—
102) 22) dialog: Please let me help you.
102) 24) dialog: You do not have to do this all alone.
102) 26) dialog: (cre: Alan’s freak out) Here, it’s alright. It’s alright. Sit down. 114. She sits him in a chair, trying to contain his hyperventilating. Alan, embarrassed at this uncontrollable display, tries t play it off, but of course he can’t stop it. With her hand on his shoulder, he notices her WEDDING RIN
102) 28) dialog: His name is Jock. We work together in Eastcote. He’s gotten me into coin collecting. Can you believe it? Joan looks around the room for a tea cup, a glass of wate anything that isn’t mouldy she can have him sip from. She sees the newspaper she brought in, grabs it.
102) 29) dialog: Do you want to do a crossword? For old times’ sake. It’ll only take five minutes. Or in your case, six. She tries to get him to smile at her joke. Joan opens the paper to a PUZZLE. Alan looks down at it. His fingers twitch. He stares at the puzzle, confused. He doesn’t know how to do it. Alan moves his hand away from the puzzle.
102) 32) dialog: But no one normal could have done this. (gestures to Christopher) This morning I took a train through a city that would not exist if it wasn’t for you. I bought a ticket from a man who would likely be dead if it wasn’t for you. I read up on my work, a whole field of scientific inquiry that only exists because of you. If you wish you could have been ‘normal’, I can promise you, I do not. The world is an infinitely better place precisely because you weren't.
102) 34) dialog: I think that sometimes it is the very people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.
