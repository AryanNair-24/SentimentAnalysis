6) 37) dialog: Alright boys. Let’s play.
21) 3) dialog: (cre: the WREN) Good God, what is it with women in little hats? John, Peter, Keith and Charles all look as well — there i fact something strangely sexy about women in little hats. John Cairncross gets up and walks into the next room, whe he finds Alan, working alone. 27.

21) 21) dialog: Lunch.
21) 24) dialog: John was trying to be nice.
21) 27) dialog: You know to pull off this irascible genius routine, one has to actually be a genius. Yet we’re the ones making progress here, aren’t we?
21) 29) dialog: We've decrypted a number of German messages by analyzing the frequency of letter distribution.
21) 32) dialog: Bye, Alan. The guys gather their things and walk out...
26) 4) dialog: You must be joking. Churchill put Alan in charge?!?!?!
26) 13) dialog: Alan, you can’t just fire Keith and Charles.
27) 5) dialog: And how are you going to do that? Alan takes a paper from his desk and TACKS IT UP ON THE W 34. ON THE PAPER: It’s a CROSSWORD PUZZLE.
40) 2) dialog: Alan! Your new minion has arrived. Alan turns to see: His new recruit, JACK GOOD. ++. But no Joan.
45) 4) dialog: I am sick of this. Sick. He made me waste four hours this morning re- wiring his plugboard matrix. Three hours yesterday on rotor positions.
45) 6) dialog: No. If our job was not impossible before it bloody well is now. Hugh stands and heads to the door —
46) 1) dialog: — Damn you and damn your useless machine.
46) 3) dialog: This machine? 48. Hugh grabs a GLASS from the table and SMASHES IT AGAINST ALAN'S MACHINE.

53) 22) dialog: Oh for God’s sake, Alan, of course you’re not a spy.
53) 24) dialog: Denniston gave me the Beale Cypher. And guess what? I broke it. “Ask and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find.” Matthew 7:7. That was the key. Far too simple for you. Pity Denniston disagrees. Joan POURS PINTS OF GUINNESS FOR THE TEAM.
53) 26) dialog: Be still my beating heart. Come join us for a drink.
53) 28) dialog: Fine, Alan can come too.

54) 3) dialog: No.
54) 7) dialog: My best to Miss Clarke.
57) 1) dialog: Look at this. As Alan and Joan stare at SCHEMATICS on the paper, Hugh SWIPES A SANDWICH from their picnic and begins to chew. HUGH ALEXANDER (CONT’D) If you run the wires across the plugboard matrix diagonally, you'll eliminate rotor positions 500 times faster.

60) 20) dialog: No. Everyone turns to see Hugh, John, and Peter at the door, wearing fresh clothes.
60) 22) dialog: God help me... If you fire Alan, you'll have to fire me too.
60) 24) dialog: Trust me, no one wants to say this less than I do, but Alan’s right. His machine can work. At least it’s the best chance we’ve got.
60) 28) dialog: We're the best cryptographic minds in Britain. Are you going to fire us all? Denniston looks to the Home Office Man, who NODS: Hugh is right. HUGH ALEXANDER (CONT’D) At least give us more time. Six more months, and if the machine doesn’t produce results we’ll go back to doing things the old way.
60) 31) dialog: This machine better bloody work.
63) 5) dialog: ».. So she’s got it in her hands, right, and she looks up at me and says, “I’m to put it in my mouth?” And I say, “yes, you know. The French way.” So she pops it in, closes her lips around the thing... And then she starts humming the bloody Marseillaise! The men BURST INTO LAUGHTER. Except for Alan, who looks a bit confused.
63) 7) dialog: Soon enough, you lucky bastard. Just then, 73. Joan comes over and throws an affectionate arm around Alan. Hugh takes

66) 1) dialog: Damn it! Everyone is pissed, frustrated. Alan looks as if he’s about to rip his own hair out: Why won’t this damned thing work? As the machine CLACKS on, oblivious, they all walk outsid
67) 3) dialog: It does not matter how much we improve on it, that machine will never be able to check 159 million million million possibilities in time.
68) 9) dialog: Hugh is looking at the girls.
68) 10) dialog: (re: Helen) Who's that, then?
68) 13) dialog: She wants me to come over. 80.
68) 15) dialog: She smiled at me awhile back and hasn’t looked again since.
68) 20) dialog: (ve: Helen’s glances) And... Brilliant. She’s in. Alan, introduce me.
68) 22) dialog: Because there is nothing like a friend’s engagement to make a woman want to do something she will later regret with the fiancé’s better- looking chum. Hugh drags Alan across the pub to Helen and Joan.
68) 27) dialog: (to the ladies) Alan Turing has a theory.
68) 29) dialog: He believes that the regulations against men and women working side- by-side are sound, because such proximity will necessarily lead to romance.
68) 31) dialog: — However, I disagree.
68) 33) dialog: I think that if I were working beside a woman all day long, I could manage to appreciate her abilities and intellect without needing to take her to bed. (to Helen) Pardon, have we met?
68) 36) dialog: So who do you agree with? Alan or myself?
68) 39) dialog: — Rubbish. 82.
68) 41) dialog: Well who is this man, so I can kick his arse?

75) 1) dialog: You did it. (turns to Alan) Bloody hell, you did it. You just defeated Nazism with a crossword puzzle. What does it feel like to do the impossible? ON ALAN’S FACE: He’s not sure. Something is bothering him but he can’t figure out what. John steps back from his work to join Hugh. 88.
75) 4) dialog: I don’t think even He has the power that we do right now.
75) 9) dialog: I’ll call Denniston. Have him radio his Admirals immediately. up the phone —
75) 14) dialog: (into phone) — Commander Denniston’s office —
75) 17) dialog: (into phone) — This is urgent, top priority —
75) 20) dialog: What the bloody hell? Hugh tries to grab the phone back — — But Alan pulls away sharply. Everyone STOPS. Turns. Looks at Alan. HUGH ALEXANDER (CONT’D) Are you mad?
75) 26) dialog: — There’s no time for this. 90. Hugh tries to GRAB THE PHONE from Alan — = but Alan PULLS it away and SMASHES THE PHONE AGAINST TH GROUND.
