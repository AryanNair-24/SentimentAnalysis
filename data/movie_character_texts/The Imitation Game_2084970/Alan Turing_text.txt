You think that because you’re sitting where you are, and I am sitting where I am, that you are in control of what is about to happen. You’re mistaken. I am in control, because I know things that you do not know. PAPERS inked black with mathematical symbols litter the floor.

ALAN TURNING’S HOUSE - MORNING DETECTIVE ROBERT NOCK, 40s, athletic, more interested in football than being a detective, hustles past a few doubl parked police cars and up the steps and into: INT. ALAN TURNING’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Detective Nock enters to find the same messy crime scene just saw. He’s addressed by SERGEANT STAEHL.
2) 15) dialog: — I would step back, if I were you.
2) 17) dialog: Step back, and don’t breathe so much.
2) 19) dialog: You're breathing heavily and you’re going to inhale this junk and you're going to leave your collicky son without a father. Detective Nock stops, and steps back. What in the world? ALAN TURING (CONT’D) Sound carries in this house.
2) 21) dialog: Cyanide. Undiluted. Wouldn’t take more than a thimbleful to kill you. Turing finishes sweeping the cyanide into a jar, before safely CAPPING IT. Turing stands, removes his scarf, and for the first time takes a look at Detective Nock. Sizes him up. ALAN TURING (CONT’D) Oh. Disappointing. Detective Knock and Sergeant Staehl exchange a look.
2) 23) dialog: I'd hoped for a bit more.
2) 25) dialog: (to Nock) You lied to your friend here about your son, which is just unseemly. Collick didn’t keep you up all night. Drink did. You’ve bags under your eyes the size of strawberries. Your topcoat reeks of whiskey. You're short of breath after walking 30 paces. And I believe Manchester United had a match yesterday, yes? I could hear the shouting from Simpson’s on my way home.
2) 28) dialog: Gentlemen, I don’t think you could figure out who broke into my house if he walked up and spat in your face. What I could really use at the moment is not a bobby but a good cleaning lady. So unless one of you has an apron in your car, I'd suggest that you file your reports and leave me alone. Staehl is about to say something — and probably something aggressive, by the look of his face — but Nock stops him.

The station is preparing for war: PAPERBOYS SCREAM the headlines: “800,000 CHILDREN EVACUAT “GERMAN BOMBS COMING!” “FOOD SUPPLIES RATIONED!” MILITARY PERSONNEL herd PACKS OF CHILDREN like cattle ont rumbling trains. The children, born with stiff upper lips, hold back their tears. A FATHER shakes the hand of his 8-YEAR-OLD SON goodbye, almost business-like. Neither knows if they’ll e see one another again. Alan moves through this determinedly, methodically, and unemotionally — it’s like he doesn’t even notice anyone i there.

5) 65) dialog: It’s the greatest encryption device in history, and the Germans use it for all major communications. (MORE )
5) 67) dialog: If the Allies broke Enigma — well, this would turn into a very short war indeed. Of course you’re working on it. But you also haven't got anywhere. If you had, you wouldn’t be hiring cryptographers out of University. You need me a lot more than I need you. I'd just as easily go work for the Germans, frankly, but they simply don’t have anything this good to work on. Our mathematicians aren’t as impressive as theirs. With one significant exception. I like solving problems, Commander. And Enigma is the most difficult problem in the world.
5) 69) dialog: Goody! Let me try and we'll know for sure. The men stare at each other. Neither blinks.

How many days would it take to check each of the settings? — John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman, and Charle Richards use PERFORATED SHEETS to analyze Enigma messages the Female Assistant deposits the pile onto Hugh Alexande desk. All around Hut 8, we see STACK after STACK of encrypted messages, just like the one that was just delivered.

I’m designing a machine that will allow us to break every message, every day, instantly. We see his work: ELECTRICAL SCHEMATICS. He’s designing a STRANGE NEW MACHINE. ON THE TEAM: A machine? That’s ridiculous.

25) 5) dialog: It’s inspired by an old Polish code machine, only infinitely more advanced.
25) 7) dialog: Fine. My response is, they are all idiots. Fire them and use the savings to fund my machine. I’1l only need about a hundred thousand pounds.

35) 24) dialog: Miss Clarke. You now have the distinct honor of having wasted more of my time than any other person in this room. Quiet. Gentlemen. And lady. You have six minutes. Begin.
35) 27) dialog: No. It takes me eight. But this test isn’t about crosswords — it’s about how you approach solving an impossible problem. Do you take the whole thing at once? Do you divide it into smaller — — Suddenly, Joan sits up. She’s finished. Early. ALAN TURING (CONT’D) You've finished?

49) 16) dialog: They're teaching it already?

ALAN TURING (CONT’D) I’ll be with Christopher if anyone needs me. Alan walks off to the adjacent Hut.

65) 14) dialog: The problem is that you’re asking a stupid question.
65) 16) dialog: Of course machines can’t think “as human beings do.” A machine is different from a human being; hence, it would think differently. The interesting question is, just because something thinks differently from you, does that mean it’s not thinking? We allow that humans have such divergences from one another. You like strawberries. I hate ice-skating. You cry at sad films. I’m allergic to pollen. What does it mean to have different tastes — different preferences — other than to say that our brains work differently? That we think differently from one another? And if we can say that about each another, why can’t we say the same for brains made of copper and steel?

68) 56) dialog: That’s impossible. The Germans are instructed to choose five letters at random to start every message.
68) 59) dialog: — In this case, love just lost the Germans the whole bloody war. Alan BOLTS out of the bar — — SPILLING BEER ALL OVER HELEN — — Who CRIES OUT, and ANGRILY RUNS OFF — — Leaving Hugh and Joan standing there, confused. They share a look: What’s gotten into Alan? Joan quickly RUNS OFF after Alan — — Hugh follows suit — 83. 84. — And John and Peter, seeing this across the room, take o after Hugh —
70) 2) dialog: What if Christopher doesn’t have to search through all the settings? What if he only had to search the ones that produce the words we already know will be in the message?
70) 5) dialog: Yes! That’s it! (looking at message) They send a weather report at 6AM. Every day. That means there are three words we already know will be in the 6am message. “Weather,” obviously, and —
70) 7) dialog: Heil bloody Hitler. Joan searches through a PILE, finding:
72) 1) dialog: Hugh — the right hand letter-rings. Set them to —
72) 3) dialog: — Peter, John — Run voltage from those rings through the back scramblers — — John and Peter go around back —
72) 5) dialog: — Yes. Joan, what’s the last 6am message? Joan reads aloud to Alan as he enters it in:
73) 1) dialog: Give me a fresh message. The last one we intercepted. Peter hands Alan one from a nearby folder — — Alan starts typing one of today’s gibberish encrypted messages into Enigma — — As John TAKES DOWN the decoded German letters — — Hugh looks at what John is writing and TRANSLATES the German into English —
73) 3) dialog: Turns out that’s the only German you need to know to break Enigma. The team EXPLODES WITH JOY. LAUGHING, HOOTING, SCREAMING, JUMPING, HUGGING. This is the happiest moment of their lives. John even starts to TEAR UP, and TRIES TO HUG ALAN — — Who just STANDS THERE, limp.
75) 10) dialog: (figuring something out) No.
75) 13) dialog: (louder) No. No.
75) 15) dialog: 
75) 18) dialog: 
75) 21) dialog: No. No. You can’t call Denniston. You can’t tell him about the attack.
75) 24) dialog: No. Let the U-Boats sink the convoy.
75) 31) dialog: Do you know why people like violence, Hugh? Because it feels good. (wipes blood from his nose) It would feel good to blow those U- Boats out of the Atlantic. But sometimes we can’t do what feels good. We have to do what’s logical. 91.
75) 33) dialog: The hardest time to lie is when the other person is expecting to be lied to.
75) 36) dialog: If they’re waiting for a lie, you can’t just give them one.
75) 39) dialog: What will the Germans think if we destroy those U-Boats?
75) 43) dialog: Suddenly our convoy veers off course and a fleet of RAF bombers magically descends on the location of a pack of U-Boats? What will the Germans think?
75) 49) dialog: Two years of work. Everything we’ve done here. It’1ll all be for nothing.
75) 51) dialog: Our job wasn’t to save one passenger convoy. It was to win the war.
75) 53) dialog: Done. Now for the hard part: keeping it a secret. Forever. Peter looks at the map...
75) 57) dialog: So?
75) 61) dialog: I’m sorry.
75) 63) dialog: It’s not my fault. Peter DIVES for Alan — — But John stops him.
75) 66) dialog: I’m so sorry.
75) 68) dialog: Yes, we do.
75) 70) dialog: Because no one else can. 94.
78) 2) dialog: We need your help to keep this from the Admiralty. Army. RAF. No one can know we broke Enigma, not even Denniston.
78) 5) dialog: While we develop a system for determining how much intelligence to act on. Which attacks to stop, which to let through. Statistical analysis. The minimum number of actions it’ll take to win the war, but the maximum number we're able to take before the Germans get suspicious.
78) 7) dialog: Correct.
78) 9) dialog: We'll require a believable alternate source for each piece of information we use.
78) 11) dialog: And the rest of our military.
80) 1) dialog: They codenamed it “Ultra.” INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - WREN’S HUT - SEQUENCE But in the WREN’S HUT, the women eagerly await the coming the day’s first messages — 96. — And a sudden BEEP BEEP BEEP announces that they have. T WRENS quickly take down the first messages —
80) 2) dialog: And it quickly became the largest store of military intelligence in the history of the world. A WREN removes the first few dozen from a pile — — And hands it over to another WREN —
81) 1) dialog: It was like having a tap on Himmler’s intercom. — Christopher HUMS — — And Hugh, after a few minutes, reads the day’s Enigma settings on the machine’s read-out: “FSOQR”
82) 1) dialog: Secrecy became the primary concern. And for some reason they trusted me. Alan organizes stacks of similar ULTRA booklets when he h trouble finding one of them — He looks up to see Peter walking nearby.
82) 2) dialog: Peter, do you have the 9:30 decrypts — But instead of answering, Peter BUMPS HARD against Alan’s shoulder, scattering Alan’s papers to the floor. Jack looks over. Peter keeps on walking. No one helps Alan as he bends down to clean up his papers Peter LEAVES Hut 8 without speaking a single word. 97. ON ALAN: He’s kneeling down in front of John’s MESSY DESK picking up papers from the floor, when his eyes come leve with something on the desk... It’s a BOOK. Buried underneath CRYPTOGRAPHIC PAPERS. Alan stares at it strangely. Something about its shape an colour look familiar... He UNCOVERS it... If’S A BIBLE. Holy shit. There’s a page dog-eared. Alan opens to the page — it’s Matthew 7:7. “Seek and ye shall find...” ON ALAN: JOHN CAIRNCROSS IS THE SOVIET SPY. Suddenly:
82) 6) dialog: I’1l tell Denniston.
83) 1) dialog: (into phone) I need to speak to Menzies... But frustrated by the response he hears, Alan HANGS UP. INT. BLETCHLEY PARK - JOAN’S FLAT - DAY Alan bursts into Joan’s flat to tell her what he’s found.
83) 2) dialog: Joan! Joan! Are you there? It’s dark. He FLICKS ON THE LIGHT... REVEAL: The room has been ransacked. Clothes, books, papers scattered everywhere. ALAN TURING (CONT’D) — Joan?!? He quickly moves through the flat: What happened here? ALAN TURING (CONT’D) Joan, are you okay? Where are you? 99. Runs to the back bedroom, where he finds... ... Stewart Menzies. Calmly looking over some papers. ALAN TURING (CONT’D) Where’s Joan?
83) 4) dialog: What have you done?
83) 6) dialog: I gave those to her. A year ago. When she was with the clerks I was—
83) 8) dialog: I know who the Soviet agent is. It’s not Joan. Menzies looks at Alan: Who is it if not her? ALAN TURING (CONT’D) ++. I found the bible... The spy is John Cairncross. Menzies SMILES. As if he’s impressed.
83) 10) dialog: You knew Cairncross was the spy?
84) 3) dialog: You placed a Soviet agent at Bletchley?
87) 4) dialog: I’m not a spy. I’m just a mathematician. 102.
87) 6) dialog: You must promise to get Joan out of prison.
89) 1) dialog: I need you to leave Bletchley.
89) 3) dialog: Menzies. I don’t trust... ON ALAN: He wants to tell her, but he can’t. It’s too dangerous. 103. ALAN TURING (CONT’D) I don’t think it’s safe here.
89) 5) dialog: You need to leave, and you need to get very far away from me.
89) 7) dialog: We can’t be engaged anymore. Your parents will have to take you back and find you a husband elsewhere.
89) 9) dialog: ».. There’s something I have to tell you. I’m... I’m a homosexual.
89) 11) dialog: Men, Joan. Not women.
89) 13) dialog: I just said —
89) 17) dialog: I don’t.
89) 19) dialog: Care for you. I never did. I only needed you to break Enigma. And now I’ve done it, so you can leave. She SLAPS HIM.
90) 1) dialog: The war dragged on for another two solitary years. Alan spends two years pressed shoulder-to-shoulder with t woman whose heart he broke. With the man whose dark secre uncovered. With the man whose brother he allowed to die.
90) 2) dialog: Every day we performed our blood- soaked calculus. Every day we decided who lived and who died. And every day we guided the Allied armies to victory without anyone knowing.
91) 1) dialog: Stalingrad? The Ardennes? Normandy? None of those victories would have been possible without the intelligence we produced.
96) 1) dialog: People talk about the war as this epic battle between civilizations. Good versus evil, liberty versus tyranny. Armies of millions bleeding into the mud, fleets of ships that weighed down the oceans, packs of airplanes that dropped bombs until they blotted out the sun itself. But it wasn’t.
97) 1) dialog: The war was really just a half- dozen crossword enthusiasts in a tiny village in the south of England.
98) 1) dialog: Was I God? No. Because God didn’t win the war. I did. 109.
100) 8) dialog: This war is over. But there will be more. And we know how to break a code that everyone else thinks is unbreakable.
101) 0) text: Alan Turing finishes telling his story to Detective Nock.
101) 2) dialog: That’s the Imitation Game.
101) 4) dialog: Now, Detective, you get to judge. That’s how the game works. I answered your questions. You know my story. That’s the point of the game. We are all pretending to be something. Imitating something. Someone. And we are no more, and no less, than what we can convince other people that we are. So tell me: What am I? Am I a person? Am I a machine? Am I a war hero? Am I a criminal?
101) 6) dialog: Well then you’re no help to me at all. ON ALAN: Turning away. He’s done with Nock.
102) 5) dialog: And what would you have said? That I wasn't a homosexual?
102) 7) dialog: Damn it...
102) 9) dialog: No I’m not.
102) 11) dialog: «++. It’s the medication.
102) 13) dialog: I have to go in for weekly oestrogen treatments. At the hospital.
102) 15) dialog: The judge gave me a choice. Prison. Or “hormonal therapy.”
102) 17) dialog: — Chemical castration. Yes. To cure my homosexual predilections. Of course I chose that. I wouldn’t be able to work from prison. Joan is HORRIFIED. 113. ALAN TURING (CONT’D) Well how would I even have got parts in jail? It just makes no sense.
102) 19) dialog: No.
102) 21) dialog: — I’m fine.
102) 23) dialog: I don’t need your help.
102) 25) dialog: Alone? I’m not alone. I never have been. He looks lovingly at his machine — at Christopher. ALAN TURING (CONT’D) . Christopher has got so smart. If I stop the treatment, they’1l take him away from me. You can’t let them do that. You can’t. Don’t let them leave me alone. Joan looks at Alan. And at Christopher. His true love. Looking at his machine, Alan starts to have a small PANIC ATTACK — he’s getting more emotional, twitching more, get teary — the hormones are flowing through him.
102) 27) dialog: (trying to seem normal) . It’s a much nicer ring than the one I got you.
102) 30) dialog: Perhaps later. The treatment has wrecked his brain so badly that he can’ crossword puzzles anymore. Joan watches and her heart utterly breaks. ON JOAN: He’s gone forever. And she knows it. Alan sees her sadness. He’s embarrassed, angry, bitter. ALAN TURING (CONT’D) +... At least it worked out for one of us. (MORE )
102) 31) text: ALAN TURING (CONT’D) You got what you wanted, didn’t you? Work. A husband. A normal life. She looks at him quietly for a moment.
102) 33) dialog: Is that what you think?
104) 0) text: Alan, Joan, Hugh, John, and Peter stand before the MASSIV BONFIRE that’s been built in the center of the Park. TITLE: Alan Turing committed suicide in 1954. TITLE: His machine was never perfected, though it generated a whole field of research into what became nicknamed “Turing Machines.” Today, we call them “compute Hugh comes over and puts one arm around Alan, another aro Joan. They have a moment: They did it. They won the war. John throws a stack of Enigma messages high into the air 117. — They watch as the papers flutter down into the fire. They laugh, and one by one they all join in: They FROLIC and PLAY as they throw every document, every of scratch paper, every bit of evidence they were there i the fire. TITLE: In 1990, John Cairncross publicly confessed to hav been a Soviet agent. He was never prosecuted. TITLE: In 2013, Turing was granted an official pardon by government. Approximately 49,000 other gay men were convi and punished under the same code between 1885 and 1967. TITLE: The logo of Apple Computer - an apple with a bite taken out of it - has long been rumored to be a silent tribute to Turing. These rumors have never been confirmed
104) 1) dialog: Well then. ON ALAN AND THE TEAM: Hugging and playing as everything t did is burnt to a crisp.
104) 2) dialog: Any questions? BLACK.
