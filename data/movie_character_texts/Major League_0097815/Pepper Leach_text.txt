24) 44) dialog: (to Temple) We got anybody left playin' baseball  out there?

Duke snaps a throw over to first, the first baseman  slapping a hard tag on Hayes, but Hayes is back. The crowd is on its feet again. The "GO" chant starts,  punctuated by thousands of black-gloved hands punching th night air. Duke comes set again. Hayes leads away. Duke watches him, checks him again. We go to SLOW MOTION as Duke kicks and  comes to the plate. Hayes takes off like a shot, head down, eating up ground. Taylor swings and misses. The Yankee catcher comes up  throwing, rifling a clothesline dart to second base. Haye leaves his feet diving for the bag. The second baseman sn down the tag. Too late. Hayes is in there. The stadium is really rockin' now. Duke prowls the mound. Taylor steps out of the box and flashes a sign to Brown.
