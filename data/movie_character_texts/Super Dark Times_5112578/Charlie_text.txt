25) 35) dialog: Guess we should call it a day. Zach shakes his head at Josh and they all start to head b to the road. Charlie winces at Daryl, trying to cheer him up. Jeez, th was nuts.

34) 7) dialog: There’s no story.
34) 9) dialog: I don’t remember. I don't remember what I did last Tuesday. Why would I remember what I did this Tuesday? Probably, I went home after school and stayed there alone until my parents got home. Like I do most weekdays.
34) 11) dialog: So why’d you come running over here to the middle school to talk to an 8th grader you barely know? ...If anyone asks? Shit. Zach hadn’t thought of that. He gets the drift. He gives Charlie a nod.
34) 12) dialog: We’re not friends. EXT. JOSH’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 45 Zach rings the doorbell. Waits. Nothing. He stares at dow at an old doormat: faded letters that say "Welcome Y'all! He knocks on the door a few times.

66) 15) dialog: That's so fucked up.
66) 17) dialog: Why would you add all this nonsense onto the situation? Isn't it bad enough as it is? Daryl's dead, isn't that enough drama for you?

66) 21) dialog: It is.
66) 23) dialog: So it was Josh? He’s your friend, isn’t he?
66) 25) dialog: So why go out of your way to put this on him? I think we're all to blame for what happened to Daryl, all three of us. Don't just blame him to avoid feeling guilty about it.
66) 27) dialog: Leave it alone, Zach!
66) 29) dialog: No! Did you? How do I know you didn’t take it? How do I know it’s even gone? Want to take me out and show me? Lure me back out there? You, me, no witnesses? No thank you.
66) 31) dialog: Listen to yourself. You’re losing it. Don’t call again. Charlie hangs up. Zach sits in the empty living room.
