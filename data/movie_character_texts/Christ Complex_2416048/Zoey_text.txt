1) 32) dialog: Because...um...the laptop, and you never go anywhere with out it-

1) 39) dialog: Of course I would. I just-
1) 41) dialog: OK...maybe. Honestly we have to save each other, who else is going to do it.
1) 43) dialog: True. Is that human nature? People rely on false deities, self help books...Rick the day I realized we were alone in the universe was the day I realized we have to be there for each other. (beat) Plus don't you find it romantic that I want to save you? Like a movie...
1) 45) dialog: (dreamy) A Cameron Crowe romantic comedy.

2) 19) dialog: Misunderstood-
2) 22) dialog: Now that's a little off base.
2) 36) dialog: It was his gang name.
2) 42) dialog: Exaggerations-
2) 44) dialog: -Unfair. Because these people need someone who is going to sacrifice their own needs for them.
2) 47) dialog: Who else is going to do it? We're alone in the universe. If we are going to make it through this "crazy world" we need to look out for each other.
2) 49) dialog: First of all you are bitter about the whole Dawkins thing, because you flashed him your tits and got us kicked out-
2) 51) dialog: -And someone who was huge supporter turns her back because Richard Dawkins didn't like her nipple piercing-
2) 53) dialog: (more banter) -Enjoy your delusional life there fence sitter. How about you pray to Thor to hit me with a lighting bolt so I can be removed from this asinine conversation.
2) 56) dialog: (detached) I actually stopped listening to you.
2) 58) dialog: Who are those guys?
2) 60) dialog: What are they doing?

2) 83) dialog: (unsure)
2) 85) dialog: (reaching her hand out) I'm Zoey.
2) 87) dialog: Oh name? Yes, most people have interesting stories behind their names...Honestly I have nothing. Not sure why my parents did that.
2) 89) dialog: (smiles) I suppose that's a compliment. So I've seen you around school, but never really...in...class...

2) 106) dialog: I'm sorry.
2) 108) dialog: So what did you need to think about? I mean if I'm not prying of course.
2) 110) dialog: I'm not sure anyone is. You know if you need a friend, I'd be glad to...well you know...listen.
2) 113) dialog: I know. (trying to double back) I mean...I've seen you around campus...you seem like a loner...I didn't mean you were a loser. Loner is kind of sexy, loser...well can kind of be too...I'll stop.
2) 115) dialog: So we can maybe go out to dinner if you want?
2) 118) dialog: And I can pay, you know..make up for the head...

3) 13) dialog: Let's go.

4) 1) dialog: Sorry about Jack...
4) 6) dialog: No not at all. This is on me.
4) 8) dialog: Listen Quinn, I'm an atheist-
4) 10) dialog: -No, I just wanted to get it out of the way. It bothers people, I mean in this state especially. Quinn puts down the menu.
4) 12) dialog: Really?
4) 14) dialog: I'm pretty sure I'm really an atheist.
4) 16) dialog: Because I'm a logical thinker. (beat) I don't mean to offend, I'm guessing you're religious.
4) 19) dialog: Oh my God you are in the ministry.
4) 21) dialog: My father was a "fire and damnation" preacher. Baptist...He's...
4) 23) dialog: It's nothing. (beat) Sorry I don't mean to rock your world.
4) 25) dialog: You poor thing. You are probably so desperate for friends-
4) 27) dialog: Have you thought about St John's Wort?
4) 29) dialog: No I'm thinking out loud mostly. I was just...well...you have some social awkwardness.
4) 32) dialog: Well you are latching on to religion to make you feel whole. It doesn't make you feel whole, or at least as whole as you thought it would-
4) 35) dialog: So you are out with me...I represent everything you were brought up to combat. You're missing something and you are looking for help.
4) 37) dialog: (smiles) See I'm good at reading people.
4) 39) dialog: I don't know Quinn you seem like a lost soul. I thought that when I saw you by the river.
4) 41) dialog: Yeah I actually do. Someone needs to save them.
4) 43) dialog: If you let me.
4) 45) dialog: (endearing smile) So what do you need Quinn?
5) 0) text: Jack is passed out drooling on the couch. Anna and Zoey are cross legged on the floor in the midst of "girl talk".

5) 5) dialog: I know. He's in the ministry-
5) 7) dialog: I know and he's understanding of that.
5) 9) dialog: It was understood.
9) 1) dialog: You guys leaving? Zoey comes out of the kitchen with a bowl of popcorn.
9) 4) dialog: Will you guys stop??
9) 15) dialog: (put out) Will you guys leave?? Jack grabs Anna by the arm and leads her to the door.
9) 18) dialog: (trying to make a point) Bye guys! Anna and Jack mumble as they head out the door.
9) 19) dialog: (turning to Quinn) Sorry about that.
11) 0) text: Zoey is curled up next to Quinn on the couch. A popcorn bowl is squeezed in between them. She reaches over and picks up the remote.
11) 1) dialog: Tonight's Feature Presentation is "I am Curious:Yellow". Probably not the best date movie, but I always show this to ever guy in the beginning.
11) 3) dialog: What??
11) 5) dialog: This might be a little hard-core for your first film.
11) 8) dialog: I feel like I'm stealing your virginity here. Zoey slowly looks over at Quinn.
11) 9) dialog: You're a virgin too aren't you? Quinn shrugs
11) 10) dialog: Oh my god! I'm a bad girl. Quinn puts his hand on her shoulder.
11) 13) dialog: (hesitant) OK? I mean I usually play this for potential boyfriends. If they can handle this, they can handle me. Zoey hits play on the remote.
11) 14) dialog: I guess you're lucky I thought about "They Call Her One Eye". (to herself) I hope this doesn't jack you up.
15) 0) text: Louis runs outside. He looks up and down the street. In the distance he finally spots them, Quinn and Zoey holding hands.
16) 0) text: Zoey and Quinn walk holding hands through the apartment building parking lot. Zoey stops for a second and turns to face Quinn.
16) 1) dialog: Why haven't I seen your place?
16) 3) dialog: That doesn't surprise me. I can't imagine you having a vast Blu Ray collection.
16) 5) dialog: Wow...Quinn, you have to start enjoying the world around you.
16) 7) dialog: So you're saying you want to come up stairs and watch "They Call Her One Eye"?
16) 9) dialog: Yeah...sorry about that...
16) 12) dialog: I...I..I'm sorry.
16) 14) dialog: I shouldn't have been that aggressive.
16) 16) dialog: 
16) 19) dialog: Puzzling...but I know...virgin and all-
16) 21) dialog: That came out rude...I just mean...I wanted to do it. I should have taken it slower.
16) 23) dialog: You sure?
16) 25) dialog: (worried) I hope so. Quinn slowly turns around and walks away. Zoey looks at him like she is unsure if she will see him again.
17) 51) dialog: What's going on?? Zoey comes to the doorway and stands behind Anna.
17) 52) dialog: Quinn? What's wrong?
17) 57) dialog: What are you talking about? Anna is right?
17) 59) dialog: 
17) 62) dialog: (nervous laugh) OK Quinn, just spit it out.
17) 65) dialog: Oh honey... Zoey touches his face.
17) 66) dialog: You must have a brain tumor or something. You're obviously mentally ill.
17) 69) dialog: Shhh. You need me more than ever. Zoey reaches down and takes a confused Quinn's hand. She leads him to the door. Like a sheep herder, she takes Quinn inside of the apartment. The last image we see is the apartment door slamming behind them.
18) 0) text: Zoey jumps out of bed, like she is waking from a nightmare. A startled Quinn, who was sleeping beside her, starts to arouse.
19) 0) text: Quinn and Zoey are having coffee. It's obvious Zoey had a rough night. She takes a sip of coffee, her mind is distant.
19) 2) dialog: Yes?
19) 4) dialog: Enjoy myself? Of course.
19) 7) dialog: It was nothing.
19) 9) dialog: It's not a big deal. It was...a...well wouldn't call it a nightmare...repressed memory. Hell, it's not repressed...I think of it all the time.
19) 11) dialog: You don't want to hear about it. Quinn touches her hand.
19) 13) dialog: My father, I mentioned him before, was a Baptist minister. He always said he had this "sickness". He begged my mom for help, it was more important though for her to having shopping and dinner dates with her girlfriends. Anna, my friend that "loves you", has been in my life since I was tiny. She used to come over all the time. My Dad adored her. When I was around twelve I found something in the closet...tapes. My Dad and Anna from the time she was like seven...He... (starts tearing up) I showed my Mom, and Dad...well he got out of prison when I was seventeen. I don't see him anymore. His church, even though they knew he had a problem disowned him. He wouldn't have done that to Anna if my mom would have supported him, got him help.
19) 16) dialog: He tried to get help Quinn, he reached out to my Mom. I should have protected Anna too...I mean-
19) 18) dialog: I have to protect people. This was out of my control, you Quinn...What's going on with you...I have control of that. Quinn looks at Zoey. He loves her, but a part of him pities her too.
20) 0) text: Zoey is curled up under Quinn's arm as they sit on the same bench from earlier. Quinn stares out toward the river. It's obvious he is pondering over his choices.
20) 2) dialog: Me too.
20) 4) dialog: You're not actually going to fight your friend to the death are you?
20) 6) dialog: Quinn, in 2 days things are going to be normal. This is just a delusion.
20) 9) dialog: I understand that. Quinn leans his head back. He catches something out of the corner of his eye.
20) 10) text: Quinn sees Ryan Blood hiding behind a tree. He is taking video of Quinn and Zoey with a "smart phone".
20) 12) dialog: What is it? Quinn doesn't answer. He gets up and runs to the...
20) 14) dialog: What was wrong?
20) 16) dialog: What are you talking about?
22) 0) text: Zoey is pacing back and forth. Jack rubs his face in frustration. He is tired of watching Zoey tear herself up over this guy. Anna tries to step into Zoey's path attempting to get her attention
22) 3) dialog: I haven't heard from Quinn since he wigged out today.
22) 5) dialog: He needs me.
22) 7) dialog: (frustrated) This isn't about me and you-
22) 11) dialog: (confused) What fucking file?
25) 0) text: Jack walks into the room holding a file folder. Zoey is sitting on the couch trying to get a grip. Jack throws the file in her lap.
25) 1) dialog: So is the file folder for dramatic effect?
25) 3) dialog: Quinn?
26) 3) dialog: You mentioned that earlier. What is going on?
26) 5) dialog: I thought that was the whole plan.
26) 7) dialog: Why don't you come over here.
26) 9) dialog: Come on Quinn get a grip. Just calm down and come over here.
26) 11) dialog: OK so just come on over and we'll talk.
26) 13) dialog: Quinn? No wait- Quinn hangs up the phone.
26) 17) dialog: I don't know. He's losing it. Jack hands her the folder.
26) 20) dialog: So what is all this?
26) 23) dialog: You're not telling me anything I didn't already know.
26) 26) dialog: I'm too far into this now. I don't have a choice. Zoey picks the documents up and places them in the folder. She then tosses the folder on the coffee table.
26) 28) dialog: Let me be guys. Zoey walks to her bedroom, leaving Anna and Jack exhausted.
26) 32) dialog: What's this? Jack's eyes try to focus on the document.
26) 35) dialog: I gathered that. Under Quinn's room...
26) 37) dialog: Quinn's roommate was Ryan Blood?
26) 39) dialog: Ah fuck.
28) 0) text: Zoey's car pulls up in front of an historic brick building. She slowly gets out and starts to look the structure over. It's almost like she is trying to assess if she has the right place.
29) 0) text: A awkward young man, JAKE, is sorting through boxes. He's kneeled on the floor organizing a mess of files. Zoey walks up and tries to attract his attention.
29) 1) dialog: Excuse me? Jake comes out of his world of file sorting. He looks up at Zoey.
29) 4) dialog: I'm looking for Mrs. Rhodes. I believe the people here referred to her as "mother".
29) 6) dialog: I'm sure they do. (looking at the boxes) You guys shutting down?
29) 8) dialog: Is there something wrong with you? MRS. RHODES, a 60 year old odd looking lady, comes out of the back.
29) 10) dialog: What? I don't know what that means. Mrs. Rhodes starts waving her hands at Zoey. She flaps them up and down in her face.
29) 12) dialog: Um...no...listen do you know Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks? They grew up here. Mrs. Rhodes steps back like a vampire who has just seen a cross.
29) 14) dialog: What?
29) 17) dialog: Um...no. Zoey turns around and starts to leave. Mrs. Rhodes starts screaming at the top of her lungs.
30) 0) text: Zoey runs outside and makes it to her car. She hits the roof of her vehicle in anger
30) 1) dialog: What a fucking nut house!
30) 3) dialog: What!
30) 5) dialog: (doesn't care) And?
30) 7) dialog: Wait Louis? You think Louis made Quinn appear crazy?
30) 10) dialog: There is more to it than that.
30) 12) dialog: Listen "Robot Boy", where did this whole belief come from? This isn't something two kids come up with on their own.
30) 14) dialog: Exactly. I heard there was an employee that got fired for sharing Mormon mythology with the boys.
31) 0) text: Zoey is parked in a parking lot, while she chats on her cell phone with Jack.
31) 2) dialog: How?
31) 5) dialog: Well...elaborate.
31) 7) dialog: -How is that different than a dream? Just saying-
31) 9) dialog: So she had Quinn committed?
31) 11) dialog: Fucking Ryan Blood!
31) 13) dialog: Thanks Jack.
31) 16) dialog: I'm going to stop an Apocalyptic battle.
31) 31) dialog: (laughs) You need to learn to lock up. Quinn walks over and sits on the bed beside her.
31) 33) dialog: Why the change of heart?
31) 35) dialog: Do you really believe? You know?
31) 37) dialog: I'll help you Quinn. I don't want to do it for myself...
31) 40) dialog: I don't want to do it because I feel I have to. Obligations, or dark incidents from my past...That's not a reason to help anyone. It makes me fucking selfish actually.
31) 42) dialog: I care about you Quinn. That's sincerely my reason for wanting to do this. That's a first for me you know?
34) 0) text: The front doors to the church swing open. Light fills the sanctuary. Zoey walks through the doors. She heads toward the alter and sees a man, in his 50's, kneeling. It appears he might be praying.
34) 2) dialog: I'm not doing it anymore. You will not have redemption from me.
34) 4) dialog: Take ownership of what you did. Don't rely on me to save you. I need to start saving myself. She slowly backs up and then turns to walk away.
34) 5) dialog: (as she is turning) Goodbye.
35) 0) text: Ryan pulls Zoey up to her feet. He presses the gun against her head. Louis walks out into the middle of the field. He's dressed in a full ninja outfit. He unsheathes his katana.
35) 2) dialog: (struggling under Ryan's grip) You're fucking crazy!
35) 5) dialog: I think you're a fucking nut bag.
35) 7) dialog: Mrs Rhodes? Does that name ring a bell?
35) 10) dialog: Go fuck yourself.
35) 13) dialog: Mrs. Rhodes? What about her? Other than she fucked you guys up. She taught you, Louis how to play it straight. Then she has you fuck Quinn over.
35) 15) dialog: Yeah by getting him in contact with you.
35) 17) dialog: Is that why she placed you in that hospital?
35) 20) dialog: Guys I have let my parents fuck me up. There comes a time though where you have to go out on your own. Take responsibility for your own life.
35) 22) dialog: This whole thing was to carry out some delusional woman's master plan. She doesn't even remember who she is at this point. I went to see her...she wanted me to take off my shirt. Louis is irritated.
35) 32) dialog: (To Quinn) I thought you didn't believe this shit anymore.
35) 34) dialog: This is fucked. Quinn you're not 5000 years old. You were born in an orphanage. None of this makes sense.
35) 36) dialog: That makes total fucking sense. Color me stupid!
35) 55) dialog: What the fuck!
35) 57) dialog: No you don't. Guys what are you doing?
35) 59) dialog: Are you being serious? Quinn stops and turns toward Zoey.
35) 61) dialog: If you don't walk away from this field right now, you will lose me. I will not be in your corner. I will call for help. They will stop you.
35) 63) dialog: Quinn...last chance. Zoey walks over to Ryan's body. She searches till she finds her cell phone in his front pocket.
35) 64) dialog: I will call the police Quinn... Quinn looks at Zoey, dead in the eyes.
35) 66) dialog: (tearing up) Wow...yeah goodbye.
35) 72) dialog: (laughs to herself) I am Curious:Yellow (beat) Goodbye boys... Zoey stares out into the open field. She feels reborn. She knows there is a new world, a new perspective for her beyond the horizon.
36) 0) text: The camera slowly pans toward an older ninety year old Zoey. She's behind a podium, there is a sign on the front that reads: Marshal University Association of Free Thought.
36) 1) dialog: For years we have thought absence of the impossible indicated that we were exercising free thought. In my experience ladies and gentleman, that's not the case. (beat) Believing in hope my friends, opening yourself up to accepting there might be more than the world around you. That's truly being a free thinker. The camera ends with a close shot on Zoey's face.
37) 0) text: Zoey sits on the same bench where she met Quinn. Her great-granddaughter, JENNIFER walks up. She sits down beside her grandmother.
37) 2) dialog: Hey...
37) 4) dialog: Just sitting here...thinking...
37) 6) dialog: I've had a great life. A wonderful husband, children, grandchildren... (motions to Jennifer) ...great grandchildren...I spent so much of my youth being angry. I wish I could relive my life now, knowing what I know.
37) 9) dialog: I've tried to pass it on to you.
37) 11) dialog: Just remember, you can believe what you want to believe Jennifer. Live by what ever moral code you want to live by. Just make sure it's yours. Don't let it stem from anger or past tragedies. (beat) Let it come from your heart. Jennifer turns around.
37) 12) dialog: What is it?
37) 15) dialog: (shakes his hand) Likewise. Jennifer grabs his hand right after his handshake with Zoey.
37) 17) dialog: (to the boyfriend) I didn't catch your name.
37) 23) dialog: Yeah I'm fine. (snapping out of it) Enjoy dinner.
37) 26) dialog: (returning contact, and smiles) Likewise. The two lovebirds walk away. Zoey stares at them for a second. A it "can't be look" crosses her face.
37) 28) text: Zoey smiles almost to say to the camera that there is more out there. Things that we don't fully understand. The smile then fades. Her final look is that of content. And then as Done and Dusted plays we...
