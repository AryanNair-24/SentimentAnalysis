13) 0) text: We creep upon Ryan Blood as he works at his computer. On closer inspection, it appears he is editing video of Quinn and Louis' mock fight earlier in the day.
14) 8) dialog: You looking for Quinn? Takes Louis' a second to register Ryan's question.
14) 10) dialog: (nodding toward the exit door) He just left.
17) 2) dialog: You're here to learn more about his "coming and goings". To find out what I have seen.
17) 4) dialog: It's more than that Louis-
17) 6) dialog: I know pretty much everything. I've watched you, studied you...I feel I'm expert on your little game every seventy years.
17) 8) dialog: Oh yes. Ryan picks up a stack of documents and throws the papers one at a time at Louis.
17) 9) dialog: You battled as mortals- (beat)
17) 12) dialog: -You were a Lamanite then- (beat) -Quinn was a commander of the Nephites, last survivor of that nation- (beat) -The savoir spoke to him, showed him his future...his destiny- (beat) -See after the death of Christ there was some debate on what was going to bring on the end and signal his return- (beat) - It was decided two great warriors had to fight. The winner would determine the start of the apocalypse. Your boss of course needed someone to represent his interests. Who better than Quinn's old adversary? Louis brushes the pile of papers of his lap.
17) 14) dialog: You had strategy in the beginning. Middle Ages...Old West...Even World War II. (beat) Let's take a step back for a second. The Old West. Lack of faith, corruption, these things make Quinn weak. The chink in his armor is his faith in people. You knew that, and corrupting America...a young land...was the key. (beat) Quinn was a step ahead of you, and looked for a human ally. That ally was Joseph Smith, and Quinn...or I mean Moroni...led Joseph to the plates that later when into- Ryan picks a book up and throws it at Louis. Louis looks down at the "Book Of Mormon".
17) 15) dialog: -His little plan didn't work, but the book is a great coffee table discussion piece. This made him weak Louis. You could have destroyed him. The problem is you've allowed yourself to become fond of him. YOU need to embrace your destiny.
17) 18) dialog: This girl is distracting him. Get his mind focused on the matter at hand. At this point I'm afraid he isn't even going to fight you.
17) 20) dialog: Maybe that's the key-
20) 10) text: Quinn sees Ryan Blood hiding behind a tree. He is taking video of Quinn and Zoey with a "smart phone".
21) 3) dialog: -Instead he is still hot and heavy with her. (beat) He even did the "bipty boom" last night.
21) 5) dialog: It's not pointless. The game has just changed is all. (beat) We have two levels here: one is making sure we keep him engaged. (beat) Honestly though that's an afterthought at this point-
21) 7) dialog: (still searching) Well when he does become engaged... Ryan throws something at Louis.
21) 9) dialog: ...We need to make sure you still have the advantage.
24) 2) dialog: I think it worked out perfectly.
27) 0) text: Louis stares out into the open field. A gust of wind blows through his hair. Ryan Blood comes up from behind and pats Louis on the back.
27) 1) dialog: We need to talk. Louis turns around to face Ryan.
27) 3) dialog: Strategy.
27) 5) dialog: Yes. I have a method-
27) 7) dialog: A 12 point system-
27) 10) dialog: Exactly. It's a sure fire plan to throw Quinn off of his game Louis laughs.
27) 12) dialog: Well the first thing you need is a battle cry.
27) 14) dialog: Yes a battle cry. Every great warrior has one.
27) 16) dialog: Of course it will. Why don't you try one out?
27) 18) dialog: Yeah, try one out right now. It's liberating.
27) 20) dialog: Come on.
27) 22) dialog: Here I'll go first- Ryan let's out a scream that sounds as though he is being sodomized.
27) 25) dialog: See? (beat) Your turn. Louis looks around.
27) 27) dialog: Of course. Louis inhales deeply and then lets out a scream. It comes out more like frightened little girl.
27) 28) dialog: Oh come on! That sounds like you are scared of the battle. What? Are you scared of Quinn? You probably are- Louis lets out another scream, this one is slightly better.
27) 29) dialog: That's good! Come on! Louis lets out another one that actually causes Ryan to jump back.
27) 30) dialog: Yes that's what I'm talking about! Out of nowhere, Quinn walks up to the two of them.
27) 31) dialog: (noticing Quinn) Quinn?!? Good to see you! Quinn grabs Louis' arm.
31) 28) dialog: Good afternoon boys and girls! I need your assistance.
31) 47) dialog: (looking at Quinn) Let me pretty the girl up a bit Ryan beats her repeatedly with the gun until she passes out cold from the trauma. Quinn tries to get to his feet, but Louis kicks him back down.
35) 8) dialog: My aunt?
35) 12) dialog: Can we go back to my aunt please?
35) 14) dialog: She didn't fuck Quinn over. She just helped him out.
35) 16) dialog: She knew one day it was all going to catch up with her. She trained me to get into the game. She told me it was my destiny.
35) 19) dialog: She was my caretaker. She told me she was sending me someone. Someone I would have to guide on to the right path.
35) 21) dialog: There is a much bigger purpose. You'll see.
35) 28) dialog: Not yet...
35) 44) dialog: He's pitting us against each other.
