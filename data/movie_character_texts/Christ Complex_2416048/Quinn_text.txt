1) 2) dialog: I appreciate the faux concern but I'm fine. Louis is taken aback.
1) 4) dialog: With our history can you honestly say you care about my well being?
1) 6) dialog: 1941-
1) 8) dialog: No, there was that little French girl I liked. You..you violated her and torched her farm killing her family-
1) 11) dialog: Well...that makes it ten times better.
1) 13) dialog: When you would rape the horses and ride away on the women?
1) 15) dialog: This isn't a 1930's boxing match. If I take dive, I'm not lining the pockets of some bookie...I'm bringing on the apocalypse. Louis takes a drink of his coffee.
1) 17) dialog: Louis I might be nervous, but I accept my role as savior of this world. (beat) We have been doing this for years-
1) 19) dialog: -and in 5 days we will do the same thing we have always done.
1) 22) dialog: (beat) We'll fight to the death.
2) 2) dialog: So what are you wanting to do? Louis searches around for a stick of his own.
2) 4) dialog: Why? Louis finds what he is looking for as he spins his limb into attack position.
2) 6) dialog: So you want me to help you get an advantage?
2) 78) dialog: (handing the ring back to her) Is this yours? She takes the ring and shoves it into her pocket.
2) 80) dialog: No need to apologize. Quinn scoots over and motions for her to sit.
2) 82) dialog: Do you want to sit?
2) 86) dialog: (He returns the gesture) Quinn. (beat) Zoey? Interesting.
2) 88) dialog: Very unique.
2) 90) dialog: I don't go to Marshall, I live near the campus though.
2) 92) dialog: As in profession? I don't really have one.
2) 94) dialog: Yeah, my father provides for me.
2) 97) dialog: Everything.
2) 99) dialog: To the river?
2) 101) dialog: I just needed to think.
2) 103) dialog: My apologies.
2) 105) dialog: (laughs) My head disagrees.
2) 107) dialog: It's really OK.
2) 109) dialog: No, I just have some problems. (beat) I'm not sure about my calling in life.
2) 111) dialog: I'd appreciate that. I don't have many friends.
2) 114) dialog: No, it's OK. I agree it never hurts to have a friend.
2) 116) dialog: 
2) 119) dialog: You really don't have to.
2) 121) dialog: 
3) 9) dialog: (confused) Um...OK? In almost the same beat, Zoey walks into the room.
3) 11) dialog: (looking at Jack) No quite pleasant. Zoey reaches out her hand to help Quinn off the couch.
3) 15) dialog: (still confused)
3) 19) dialog: (To Jack and Anna) Nice meeting both of you.
4) 0) text: Zoey shuts the door and then turns to stop Quinn.
4) 2) dialog: I like him.
4) 5) dialog: Zoey I would be more than happy to pay.
4) 7) dialog: I can cover dessert at least.
4) 9) dialog: -So you don't want dessert?-
4) 11) dialog: It doesn't bother me.
4) 13) dialog: I don't believe anyone is truly an atheist at the end.
4) 15) dialog: Why's that?
4) 17) dialog: One supports the business they are in I guess.
4) 20) dialog: (smiles) Kind of.
4) 22) dialog: He's?
4) 24) dialog: (smiles) You didn't.
4) 26) dialog: (laughs) What?
4) 28) dialog: You are a very cryptic speaker.
4) 30) dialog: 
4) 33) dialog: You are kind of right on that one.
4) 36) dialog: I am looking for help. I'm out with you though because I'm interested in getting to know you.
4) 38) dialog: (rolls eyes, smiles) Kind of.
4) 40) dialog: You like lost souls don't you?
4) 42) dialog: You going to save me?
4) 44) dialog: I think you might be able to.
4) 46) dialog: (smiles) Dessert.
6) 0) text: Quinn is sleeping in his bed. His room is rather bare, with the exception of the basic living necessities. It almost appears like a room at the "Y".
6) 1) text: A foot is seen kicking the bed, startling Quinn.
6) 5) dialog: (getting his bearings) Out...thinking.
6) 7) dialog: So what do you need?
7) 0) text: Louis and Quinn walk out into a huge open field. Louis is carrying a black tote bag that he drops on the ground.
7) 2) dialog: Not bad. Quinn points at the bag
7) 3) dialog: What's in the bag?
7) 7) dialog: (catching it) It's kind of lightweight..and silly.
8) 0) text: Louis sips his coffee, while Quinn just stares out the front window. It almost as if he is searching for something.
8) 2) dialog: A lot on my mind...
8) 4) dialog: Louis our whole purpose here, is to show up, and over time establish a social base, and then kill each other.
8) 6) dialog: That's because you find a way to screw it up every time.
8) 11) dialog: That's something we agree on. I'm tired too.
8) 13) dialog: Letting you win is not an option.
9) 0) text: Quinn is sitting on the couch as Jack and Anna make their way for the door.
9) 5) dialog: It's OK. I like your friends. Anna walks over to the couch.
9) 8) dialog: Yes?
9) 10) dialog: Sort of.
9) 12) dialog: It's complicated.
9) 14) dialog: Well...
9) 20) dialog: It's really OK.
11) 0) text: Zoey is curled up next to Quinn on the couch. A popcorn bowl is squeezed in between them. She reaches over and picks up the remote.
11) 2) dialog: It's OK this will be my first film experience.
11) 4) dialog: Yeah, I've never seen a film before. I mean I know of films, can't live in this world and not. I've just never seen one.
11) 6) dialog: No it's OK. I'm excited. Zoey shakes her head.
11) 11) dialog: (smiles) You are not. Quinn motions to the TV.
11) 12) dialog: Please play the film.
12) 0) text: Quinn is sitting cross legged in the middle of the field. He seems as though he is in the middle of a trance.
12) 1) dialog: (monotone) I am curious Yellow... Louis walks up and throws a toy sword on Quinn's lap.
12) 4) dialog: Nothing really. The two start to sword fight, but Quinn does not have his heart in it.
12) 7) dialog: Have you ever seen a movie? Louis follows his lead.
12) 9) dialog: Really?
12) 11) dialog: I think they have a pretty good idea.
12) 13) dialog: No...
12) 16) dialog: It's not what we are here to do.
12) 18) dialog: I have to stay focused.
13) 0) text: We creep upon Ryan Blood as he works at his computer. On closer inspection, it appears he is editing video of Quinn and Louis' mock fight earlier in the day.
14) 0) text: Louis' set up is more lavish than Quinn's. It's obvious he indulges just a little too much. Louis comes out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist. He starts singing "Motown" songs to himself. He walks back off screen to the bedroom. We still hear him singing, as we pan around the apartment. We swing back around to the entrance of Louis' bedroom. He finally comes out fully dressed. He uses the towel he was wearing to finish drying his hair. He walks up to a mirror and starts looking at himself.
15) 0) text: Louis runs outside. He looks up and down the street. In the distance he finally spots them, Quinn and Zoey holding hands.
16) 0) text: Zoey and Quinn walk holding hands through the apartment building parking lot. Zoey stops for a second and turns to face Quinn.
16) 2) dialog: My place isn't very exciting.
16) 4) dialog: Blu Ray?
16) 6) dialog: You know I realized today you are right about that.
16) 8) dialog: (laughs) Uh...no. I'm still trying to get I am Curious Yellow out of my head.
16) 11) dialog: (smiles) It's OK. Suddenly, guided by instinct, Zoey kisses Quinn on the lips. Quinn is completely thrown.
16) 13) dialog: No don't be.
16) 15) dialog: No...it's OK.
16) 18) dialog: I need to get back though.
16) 20) dialog: -Well...I mean...
16) 22) dialog: It's OK. I'll be by tomorrow.
16) 24) dialog: Yes of course.
17) 24) dialog: You've been waiting long?
17) 26) dialog: -because you are spying on me again? So I don't need to tell you where I've been. Louis sits down on the edge of the bed.
17) 28) dialog: It's started again. You're already jealous. You are going to do the same thing you did during the war...you're going to sabotage this.
17) 31) dialog: Don't you play that game. You are being facetious.
17) 33) dialog: So why are you here?
17) 35) dialog: Who I am? Of course not!
17) 37) dialog: There's a lot of harm in telling her.
17) 39) dialog: She has a best friend who is very guarded of me...It's odd she eluded to the same thing. You know the whole "I'm hiding something, and I need to come out into the open" thing.
17) 41) dialog: Well I better do this now then.
17) 43) dialog: Can you let yourself out?
17) 49) dialog: I need to see Zoey.
17) 53) dialog: I need to talk to you, it's important. Quinn grabs her by the arm and pulls her outside, pushing her right past Anna.
17) 56) dialog: I need to tell you everything. Anna is so right.
17) 58) dialog: I've not been honest with you about what I do...or who I am.
17) 61) dialog: I need to come clean. I want you to trust me. I want your friends to trust me.
17) 63) dialog: 
17) 67) dialog: Zoey? I...
18) 0) text: Zoey jumps out of bed, like she is waking from a nightmare. A startled Quinn, who was sleeping beside her, starts to arouse.
19) 0) text: Quinn and Zoey are having coffee. It's obvious Zoey had a rough night. She takes a sip of coffee, her mind is distant.
19) 1) dialog: Last night?
19) 3) dialog: Did you?
19) 6) dialog: Based on how you are acting this morning I have my doubts. That's not what I meant though. You woke up screaming.
19) 8) dialog: I understand if you don't want to talk about it. I'm just concerned.
19) 10) dialog: What is it?
19) 12) dialog: Please? Zoey takes a deep breath.
19) 15) dialog: Who do you think is to blame?
19) 17) dialog: -None of this was your fault.
20) 0) text: Zoey is curled up under Quinn's arm as they sit on the same bench from earlier. Quinn stares out toward the river. It's obvious he is pondering over his choices.
20) 1) dialog: I love being with you.
20) 3) dialog: I can't renege on my responsibilities with Louis though. Zoey sits up.
20) 5) dialog: I know you don't understand this. We just need to make the most of our time.
20) 7) dialog: I know you don't understand. I just need to go see Louis today.
20) 10) text: Quinn sees Ryan Blood hiding behind a tree. He is taking video of Quinn and Zoey with a "smart phone".
20) 15) dialog: My neighbor Ryan Blood...looks like he's spying on me.
20) 17) dialog: I need to go see Louis.
23) 0) text: Quinn runs toward Louis' apartment. His KNOCKS sound like a jackhammer on the door. Louis answers.
23) 2) dialog: We have a problem.
26) 0) text: Quinn is on a pay phone, he's shaking. At this point he is lost on what his next move should be.
26) 2) dialog: Ryan Blood!
26) 4) dialog: He's with Louis. They're planning to kill me.
26) 6) dialog: No it's...this isn't like Louis. I think he is trying to cheat his way to a win.
26) 8) dialog: I can't!
26) 10) dialog: You're right.
26) 12) dialog: No I mean you're right. I need to get control of myself. I have a destiny. I need to figure out my next move.
27) 32) dialog: We need to talk.
27) 34) dialog: I know that guy and I don't trust him.
27) 37) dialog: Your new friend is dangerous.
27) 39) dialog: Leave her out of this.
27) 41) dialog: It's over. This whole thing is nuts. I'm walking away.
31) 30) dialog: How do people keep ending up in my room?
31) 32) dialog: I'm not fighting Louis.
31) 34) dialog: I think you might be right. I don't think it's necessary. I think the world will keep turning one way or another. I'm not dependant on that. (beat) I'm not a savior.
31) 36) dialog: Yes. I do believe it. I know it actually. Since I have been with you, I've doubted what I know to be fact though. Then it hit me, it really doesn't matter.
31) 41) dialog: You're not selfish Zoey.
31) 43) dialog: I know... Quinn hugs her and they slowly lay down on the bed together.
31) 46) dialog: (in pain) Let her go! Louis has a hold of Zoey. Quinn gets up and goes for Ryan. Louis drop kicks Quinn and sends him flying across the room. Louis throws Zoey at Ryan. Ryan then holds her at gun point.
31) 50) text: We see Louis with great force repeatedly hit Quinn with the gun. Everything goes fuzzy and then we...
32) 0) text: Quinn crouches down beside Jack. Jack and Anna are both tied up, Anna still has duct tape across her mouth. You can hear her muffled screams as they fill the room.
32) 1) dialog: Where's Zoey?
32) 3) dialog: (like he is talking to a retarded child) I...will...come...rescue...you
32) 6) dialog: That actually felt kind of good. Quinn pats Jack on the head.
32) 7) dialog: I'll be back guys. Quinn leaves the room. Muffled cursing can be heard through out the apartment.
32) 8) text: A long black box is pulled out from under Quinn's bed. We see Quinn's hands unlatch and then open it. Inside we see Quinn's katana. His hand grips the hilt.
33) 0) text: Quinn gets up, holding his katana and ready for a fight. He's dressed in a black biker jacket, kind of looking like the Bride from Kill Bill. He walks to the doorway. He stands still for a second. He's preparing his next move. Bad ass comic book pose...'nuff said.
35) 27) dialog: Let her go! Ryan grabs her tighter.
35) 30) dialog: (To Louis) Is this the game you want to play?
35) 33) dialog: There's more going on than you realize Zoey.
35) 37) dialog: (to Louis) You don't get it do you.
35) 39) dialog: If you win...you're not becoming the antichrist.
35) 41) dialog: It's   Ryan...it's always been Ryan.
35) 45) dialog: I'm going to be honest with you Louis. I've always been honest.
35) 47) dialog: We have always played this game as honest as we could. We never did anything to undermine the other. Despite what you represent, you have moral code. (beat) You are not acting with in that code today.
35) 49) dialog: You're losing right now. Your actions, you can't win like this. Not acting this way.
35) 51) dialog: You going to shoot me?
35) 56) dialog: Zoey go home. We need to finish this. Louis walks over to Ryan and grabs his katana.
35) 60) dialog: I will always love you. You have to go though.
35) 62) dialog: Go...
35) 65) dialog: Goodbye. Quinn turns toward Louis. He pulls his katana up to attack position and Louis follows suit.
37) 0) text: Zoey sits on the same bench where she met Quinn. Her great-granddaughter, JENNIFER walks up. She sits down beside her grandmother.
