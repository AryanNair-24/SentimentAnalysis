12) 21) dialog: Can we get back to the matter at hand? Louis brings his sword back up into attack position. Quinn is back to his "swashbuckling" self. The two battle it out on the field, matching each other blow for blow.
13) 0) text: We creep upon Ryan Blood as he works at his computer. On closer inspection, it appears he is editing video of Quinn and Louis' mock fight earlier in the day.
14) 0) text: Louis' set up is more lavish than Quinn's. It's obvious he indulges just a little too much. Louis comes out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist. He starts singing "Motown" songs to himself. He walks back off screen to the bedroom. We still hear him singing, as we pan around the apartment. We swing back around to the entrance of Louis' bedroom. He finally comes out fully dressed. He uses the towel he was wearing to finish drying his hair. He walks up to a mirror and starts looking at himself.

17) 7) dialog: Really?

17) 19) dialog: I'm surprised this girl even likes Quinn. He comes across creepy.
17) 21) dialog: (lightbulb) -Make her think he's crazy.
17) 23) dialog: Where have you been? The silhouette comes out of the darkness and into view. It should come to no surprise that Louis is emerging from the darkness.
17) 25) dialog: No I figured you were on your way back-
17) 27) dialog: Who's the girl?
17) 29) dialog: I'm insulted frankly.
17) 32) dialog: No, I'm being serious. You care about the girl, it's obvious. Not in a friendship or I'm curious about human behavior way. Quinn sits down beside him.
17) 34) dialog: Have you told her?
17) 36) dialog: Quinn you only have a few days left and you care for this girl- (beat) - What's the harm in telling her?
17) 38) dialog: If this is real and you really care for this girl, you have to tell her. It's only fair to her.

17) 42) dialog: Yeah you don't want to lose your nerve.
17) 45) dialog: Of course. Quinn slowly opens the door and walks out. The door creeps shut behind him. Louis smiles to himself, feeling satisfaction. His face looks evil, almost demonic.
21) 0) text: Louis is watching the video on the smart phone. He's seen enough, he throws it back to Ryan. Louis tosses trash off the couch so he can sit down.
21) 1) dialog: (sitting down) I thought him admitting his true self would break them up-
21) 4) dialog: The fight is pointless.
21) 6) dialog: So what's the next move? Ryan reaches into his desk drawer.
21) 8) text: Louis catches the item. He looks down to see a nine millimeter.
23) 0) text: Quinn runs toward Louis' apartment. His KNOCKS sound like a jackhammer on the door. Louis answers.
23) 3) dialog: You're right. We do. Louis moves slightly and we see Ryan Blood in the background. Louis slowly closes the door in a stunned Quinn's face.
24) 0) text: Louis turns toward Ryan.

27) 21) dialog: (extremely confused) Right here?
27) 23) dialog: That was...interesting.
27) 26) dialog: So right now?
27) 33) dialog: (to Ryan) Excuse me for a second. Louis walks with Quinn to a spot that gives them some distance away from Ryan.

27) 38) dialog: So is yours.
27) 40) dialog: You fighting tomorrow morning Quinn?
27) 42) dialog: Let me walk away from you first then. Louis starts to walk away from Quinn. He turns around as he continues to walk backwards.

31) 48) dialog: Hold on sunshine!
31) 50) text: We see Louis with great force repeatedly hit Quinn with the gun. Everything goes fuzzy and then we...
35) 0) text: Ryan pulls Zoey up to her feet. He presses the gun against her head. Louis walks out into the middle of the field. He's dressed in a full ninja outfit. He unsheathes his katana.
35) 1) dialog: What do you think Zoey? I'm a ninja!
35) 4) dialog: That's not nice! I think I look good.
35) 6) dialog: This is going to be fun. You'll see.
35) 9) dialog: Yeah...yeah...she played a part in the game. Tell us something we don't know. You're such a sexy Nancy Drew right now.
35) 11) dialog: Or a foul mouthed Velma. That gets me so hard. Does that get you hard Ryan?
35) 23) dialog: Will you shut up?!? You are ruining my climatic fight. Louis spies Quinn in the distance.
35) 24) dialog: Showtime.
35) 31) dialog: I'm not going to lose this time.
35) 35) dialog: Lady, it would look weird if we roamed the earth for 5000 years without facing a mortal death! We keep getting reborn, sometimes we even switch physical form. Thanks for coming to the game late missy!
35) 38) dialog: What?!?
35) 40) dialog: What are you talking about??
35) 42) dialog: (To Ryan) What is he talking about?
35) 46) dialog: Yeah sometimes to a fault.
35) 48) dialog: I'm tired of losing...
35) 50) dialog: I'm tired of you. I'm going to end it! Louis goes over to Ryan. He trades his sword in for Ryan's gun. Ryan holds the katana to Zoey's throat. Louis points the gun dead at Quinn.
35) 52) dialog: It's the endgame. Tense moment as Louis aims the gun at Quinn. SUDDENLY he spins and shoots Ryan dead in the head. Ryan falls and Zoey gets free. Louis looks at Quinn and then throws the gun far out into the field.
35) 53) dialog: OK...I guess I do have some morals.
35) 58) dialog: Go home girl!
