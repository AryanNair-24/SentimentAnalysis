69) 1) dialog: You have the president of the United States inquiring about an investigation that I don’t even know about! This is not the Middle East, Ms. Green! In this part of the world, there are rules. There are regulations. There are agreements between countries on how to obtain evidence in a criminal case... ecially if it has to do with a lester of a foreign country! How could I not know this investigation was going on??

End of story. False alarm. We can all relax. Carol looks up at Alex to see if she is understanding her But Alex’s expression is anything but relaxing.
70) 10) dialog: Don’t give me that look. Norman Oppenheimer is not a friend of mine. I know him like I know four million other people. I don’t even remember what the connection is. He knows a cousin of mine... He sends me e-mails... I don’t think I’ve ever responded to him. If he turns out to be a crook, I couldn’t care less.
