12) 6) dialog: This way. Come.
12) 11) dialog: Come. Quickly!
13) 14) dialog: You're not upset?
13) 19) dialog: At least I'm not boring... right?
13) 24) dialog: Do you like it?
13) 29) dialog: Can I... ? He's beautiful!
13) 33) dialog: Incredible. He might very well be the last of his kind.
13) 36) dialog: And look, he's your age! No wonder you get along so well.
13) 39) dialog: And retractable teeth? Ah! How did you manage to--
13) 44) dialog: This Snafflefang lost his leg to one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps. This Raincutter had her wing sliced by razor netting. And this poor Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree snare... then left to die alone and scared. (re: Toothless' tail) And what of this? Did Drago or his trappers do this, too?
13) 52) dialog: What did your father think of your Night Fury friend?
13) 60) dialog: If only it were possible.
13) 64) dialog: -- Believe me, I tried, as well. But people are not capable of change, Hiccup. Some of us... were just born different.
14) 8) dialog: Stop! You'll only make it worse!
14) 15) dialog: Hiccup!
15) 22) dialog: Don't!
15) 32) dialog: 
15) 34) dialog: 
16) 4) dialog: You and your father nearly died that night, all because I couldn't kill a dragon.
16) 8) dialog: It broke my heart to stay away, but I believed you'd be safer if I did. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 45.
16) 14) dialog: Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm me. He must've thought I belonged here...
16) 17) dialog: In the home of the great Bewilderbeast. The alpha species. One of very few that still exist.
16) 21) dialog: With his icy breath, this graceful giant built our nest. A safe haven for dragons everywhere.
16) 25) dialog: He protects us. We all live under his care. And his command.
16) 28) dialog: All but the babies, of course... HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 46.
16) 32) dialog: ... who listen to no one.
16) 36) dialog: I've lived among them for twenty years, Hiccup, learning their ways, discovering their secrets...
16) 39) dialog: He likes you.
16) 44) dialog: You must be hungry.
16) 48) dialog: Good. It's feeding time. Toothless tucks himself beneath Cloudjumper's wing, tryin befriend him, but Cloudjumper isn't having any of it. He grimaces and follows Valka out.
19) 9) dialog: (with a mischievous grin) Oh, we are.
21) 6) dialog: When I'm up here, I don't even feel the cold. I just feel...
21) 10) dialog: This is what it is to be a dragon, Hiccup.
21) 32) dialog: Incredible.
21) 36) dialog: All this time, you took after me. And where was I?
21) 41) dialog: I can teach you all I've learned, these past twenty years. Like...
21) 44) dialog: Now you can make those tight turns.
21) 50) dialog: Every dragon has its secrets.
21) 53) dialog: And I'll show them all to you. We'll unlock every mystery, find every last species, together, as mother and son.
21) 63) dialog: What? There's no talking to Drago.
21) 67) dialog: -- No. We must protect our own.
21) 70) dialog: Now come on, we should be getting back.
24) 46) dialog: 
24) 50) dialog: Well, what sign did I have that you could change, Stoick? That anyone on Berk could?
24) 52) dialog: I pleaded so many times to stop the fighting, to find another answer, but did any of you listen?
24) 58) dialog: 
24) 62) dialog: Oh stop being so stoic, Stoick. Go on... SHOUT, SCREAM, SAY SOMETHING!
27) 13) dialog: I'm... a little out of practice.
27) 60) dialog: 
27) 63) dialog: 
27) 72) dialog: 
27) 96) dialog: No need for drastic measures.
27) 107) dialog: Yes!

28) 129) dialog: Thank you.
28) 137) dialog: I'll do my best! Come on, Cloudjumper!
28) 154) dialog: No!
29) 105) dialog: Stoick... She helps Hiccup to turn Stoick's body over. Valka presse her ear to Stoick's heart, confirming his death with a me glance to Hiccup. He tears up, overwhelmed.
29) 119) dialog: It's not his fault. You know that.
29) 133) dialog: No, don't!
30) 19) dialog: You came early into this world. You were such a wee thing. So frail, so fragile. I feared you wouldn't make it.
30) 22) dialog: But your father... he never doubted. He always said you'd become the strongest of them all.
37) 24) dialog: Go get `em.
37) 76) dialog: No! No...
37) 85) dialog: To protect you. The Bewilderbeast ROARS at this act of insubordination. Toothless fires back, time and again, fully in control.
37) 163) dialog: Your father... he'd be every bit as proud as I am. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 96.
37) 168) dialog: And here I'll stay.
