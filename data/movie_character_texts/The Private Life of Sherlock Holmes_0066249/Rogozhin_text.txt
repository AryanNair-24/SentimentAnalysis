11) 22) dialog: Mister Holmes?
11) 24) dialog: I am Nicolai Rogozhin, director-general of the Imperial Russian Ballet. So glad you accept invitation. Holmes and Watson start to get up, but he motions them back into their chairs.
11) 27) dialog: Pleased to meet you. (seating himself behind them) You are enjoying?
11) 29) dialog: (abruptly) Tell me, Mr. Holmes, how is your health?
11) 32) dialog: (to Holmes) Any insanity in your family?   Diabetes? Asthma?
11) 34) dialog: Certainly.   Madame Petrova, she has problem.
11) 36) dialog: Certainly not.
11) 41) dialog: After performance, there will be little celebration backstage -- and Madame requests your presence.
11) 43) dialog: (to Watson) You are invited, also. With a parting look he exits, pulling the plush curtains closed.
11) 46) dialog: There you are, Mr. Holmes. Madame is expecting you in her dressing room. Dr. Watson, you will amuse yourself meanwhile -- we have vodka, caviar, girls.
11) 49) dialog: No girls?
11) 51) dialog: Dievushki. Siude, siuda, dievushki. Posnakomtes s docktorum Watsonom. Half a dozen ballerinas descend on on Dr. Watson. They are giggling and chattering in Russian. Rogozhin leads Holmes off, while Watson takes in the bevy of beauties around him.
11) 58) dialog: Mr. Holmes, I must prepare you -- this is no ordinary case.
11) 61) dialog: Good. Because you will find this extra- extraordinary. They have now reached the door of Madame's dressing room. Rogozhin knocks. The door is opened by an elderly Russian maid.
11) 62) dialog: Madame Petrova prinimaet?
12) 1) dialog: Ja priviol vam Mistera Sherlock Holmesa, doragaia.
12) 9) dialog: Short, tall, who cares?   It is the brains that count.
12) 13) dialog: Madame is great admirer of yours. She has read every story -- her favorite is Big Dog from Baskerville.
12) 16) dialog: Mr. Holmes, you know about fiddles. (takes violin out, hands it to him)
12) 21) dialog: You like?
12) 24) dialog: Here -- take it. Madame says it is yours.
12) 26) dialog: For services you will render.
12) 28) dialog: I am not.   But Madame is. Petrova emerges from behind the paravent, in a brocade dressing gown.
12) 31) dialog: All right.   I will pour vodka and explain. (starts pouring vodka; it is pink) Mr. Holmes, what you have seen tonight is last and positively final performance of Madame Petrova. She is retiring.
12) 33) dialog: She has been dancing since she was three years old. And after all, she is now thirty-eight.
12) 35) dialog: That is because she is   forty-nine. (he hands her a   glass of vodka, with an   exaggerated smile) So Madame has decided   to leave ballet and spend life bringing up   her child.
12) 37) dialog: (hands him vodka) Problem now is to find father.
12) 39) dialog: Correct.
12) 41) dialog: Also correct. We must have father, because without father, how can there be child?
12) 44) dialog: Correct again. Madame would like child to be brilliant and beautiful. Since she is beautiful -- she now needs man who is brilliant. Holmes' eyes wander slowly toward Petrova.    She raises her glass.
12) 46) dialog: (raising his glass) Za zdorovie.
12) 49) dialog: What does it taste like?
12) 51) dialog: That's what's in it. While Rogozhin refills Petrova's glass and his own, Holmes takes another tentative sip.
12) 55) dialog: Madame wants to know how soon you can be ready.
12) 57) dialog: To leave for Venice. All arrangements have been made. You will spend one week there with Madame...
12) 59) dialog: To tell you truth, you were not first choice. We considered Russian writer, Tolstoi --
12) 61) dialog: Too old... Then we considered the philosopher, Nietzsche --
12) 63) dialog: Too German... And we considered Tschaikowski --
12) 65) dialog: We could -- and we did.   It was catastrophe.
12) 67) dialog: You don't know? Because Tschaikowski -- how shall put it? Women not his glass of tea.
12) 71) dialog: Madame is very happy with final choice.
12) 73) dialog: So?
12) 75) dialog: Perfect. We don't want sentimental idiots -- falling in love, committing suicide. One week in Venice -- she goes back to St. Petersburg with baby -- you go back to London with fiddle.
12) 77) dialog: (to Petrova) On govorit, chto v jevo semie stradajut ghemofilijei.
12) 80) dialog: Madame says not to worry.    She will not scratch you.
12) 83) dialog: Madame says you talk too much.    You find her attractive or no? Before Holmes can answer, the door opens and Watson sticks his head in. He is flushed and slightly inebriated, and there is a flower tucked behind his ear. From off comes the SOUND of wild balalaika music.
12) 85) dialog: It means 'You little devil.'
12) 87) dialog: (to Holmes) I repeat question. You find Madame attractive or no? Holmes is still looking at the door where Watson exited, an idea forming in his mind.
12) 89) dialog: Then no problem.
12) 92) dialog: Not free?   You are a bachelor.
12) 94) dialog: What is it you are trying to tell me?
12) 96) dialog: Get to point.
12) 98) dialog: You mean, you and Dr. Watson -- ? (Holmes nods) He is your glass of tea?
12) 101) dialog: On pederast.
12) 107) text: It would have been catastrophe. He exits.   Rogozhin starts to pour himself another glass of vodka.   Petrova slaps the glass out of his hand.
12) 120) dialog: Why?   Do you not prefer it this way?
12) 123) dialog: You don't have to pretend. Mr. Holmes told us everything -- about you and him --
12) 125) dialog: Come now, no need to be bashful. We are not bourgeois. Maybe with doctors and detectives is unusual -- but in ballet, is very usual.
12) 127) dialog: Caprice of Mother Nature. Look at Pavel and Mischa and Boris and Dmitri -- Watson looks around at the boys in tights, who are standing in a half-circle, grinning at him insolently. It is beginning to dawn on him. He pales.
12) 128) dialog: -- And Ilya and Sergei -- (breaks off, rocks his hand back and forth)
