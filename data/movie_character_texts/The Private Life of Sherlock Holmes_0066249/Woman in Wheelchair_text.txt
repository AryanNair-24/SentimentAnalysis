33) 17) dialog: (addressing birds) Good morning, my pretties. Here's Mum with your breakfast. Did you think I'd forgotten you? She pours grain from the paper bag into a feeder hanging inside the cage, pours water from the pitcher into a trough.
33) 18) dialog: Some  of you will be going on a little trip  soon -- I hate to lose you -- but even  an old woman has to live. Although you  might well ask, why? She cackles to herself, glances toward the front door.
33) 20) dialog: Oh.   You never told me we had a letter. She starts to wheel herself toward the front of the shop. Through a crack in the door behind which our three are hiding, we see Holmes' eye watching her. The old woman reaches the letter, picks it up, studies the address. Then she hears something, glances toward the open rear door. A horse-drawn wagon with a canvas top is just pulling into the mews. Two CARTERS jump down from the driver's seat, and one of them takes a small bird-cage from the back of the wagon. As they start in through the door, the old woman drops the letter into her lap, wheels herself toward them.

33) 35) dialog: (to birds) All right, my pretties. Back to sleep you go. See you tomorrow. She pulls the rope and the tarpaulin drops back over the cage. Then she deposits the letter on top of the covered cage, wheels herself out the rear door. As she slides it shut from outside, our trio is revealed in their hiding places behind the door. There is the sound of the chain rattling, the lock snapping, and the squeaky wheels moving off.
