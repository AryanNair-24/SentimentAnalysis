Sarah Isabel Harris, I'd rather die with you than live in this world without you, emphatic period. Sarah’s speechless for a moment.
112) 19) dialog: Yeah, hopefully that didn’t distract from my point. Nyles locks eyes with her, letting his declaration of commitment linger for as long as he needs to. Sarah finally breaks the silence: A beat...
112) 21) dialog: (smiling) We're already sick of each other. It’s the best. 113.
112) 23) dialog: Yes, less mundane. That’s a very low bar, great place to start. She cracks a smile.
113) 0) text: From the inside looking out, Sarah and Nyles stand at the mouth of the cave. Her in her C4 vest, him with a broken in his swim trunks and Hawaiian shirt. A perfect engageme photo. They begin their walk in.
113) 1) dialog: So did that goat thing actually work or was that bullshit?
113) 3) dialog: Son of a bitch. Sarah takes his hand.
113) 4) dialog: Hey, where do you wanna go on our first date when this for sure works? The orange light BRIGHTENS on their faces. They look at each other, still walking forward...
114) 0) text: Yesterday, last year, today, tomorrow... Sarah and Nyles float on an extra large pizza raft in a pool, burritos in hand, horchata in the pepperoni cupholders.
114) 2) dialog: Only one thing?
114) 5) dialog: But is there any answer that’1ll be satisfying to you?
114) 7) dialog: But does it not run the risk of disappointment if I tell you what happened? By this point your mind is made up about me, whether you love me, hate me, or anything in between. And if I tell you how I found the cave, that might give you a sense of truth, but will it be satisfaction? Our energy should be focused on pursuing what gives us -- Sarah SLURPS her horchata loudly, growing peeved.
114) 8) dialog: Isn't it more exciting to live your life always having some sense of mystery?
114) 10) dialog: Yeah. I guess it is. Sarah smiles. She stops the Tecate box and grabs a beer.
114) 12) dialog: I’m good. Watching my figure. (then) Look. A turtle. Nyles points to the scarred TORTOISE walking toward them the other side of the backyard. As they gaze at it -- “Forever and Ever” by Demis Roussos kicks in... We FLOAT UP AND AWAY from Nyles and Sarah... And as we ge farther away we see they’re in this pool by themselves, i the backyard of a secluded desert house... Scattered civilization, farther away, dinos in the distan up into a cloud, until we can’t see shit anymore. CUT TO BLACK.
