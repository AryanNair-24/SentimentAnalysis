79) 12) dialog: Of course not. That’s what you’ve been telling me from day one. “The only way to live is to embrace the fact that nothing matters.” Right? So I’m embracing it. 69. Nyles sits back. She’s right. But he doesn’t want to admi it. He glances out the window, searching for an answer, a distraction, and notices a BILLBOARD for a local casino.
79) 14) dialog: Ooo, good call. That’s even better than a bank.
79) 16) dialog: For a guy who supposedly cares about nothing, you seem to have a lot of lines you won't cross. Nyles drinks his beer, done debating this.

80) 8) dialog: Don’t call me a fucking kid. I didn’t know I couldn’t bet more. (to Dealer) Apologies. Sarah kisses her fingertips and makes a peace sign -- and rotates into a middle finger aimed at the Grumpy Player. Nyles clocks this as the Dealer looks at him for his turn
80) 10) dialog: I want more.
80) 13) dialog: Don’t tell me what to fucking do. (to Dealer) Hit me. Hard. The Dealer lays down a QUEEN on her TEN/NINE. BUST.

81) 7) dialog: Not quite what I had in mind, but glad we did it, ya know? This world is too small for dicks like that. She gestures to the Grumpy Player giving his statement to cops. But Nyles looks at her, blank-faced. We now see his right eyeball is completely red and draining bloody tears
81) 9) dialog: Oh shut up. No one got “harmed.”
81) 11) dialog: You’1l be fine tomorrow.
81) 13) dialog: It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters. Those are your words.

81) 19) dialog: I’m stuck in this shit because YOU got me stuck in it.
81) 21) dialog: I followed you because I liked you and someone was trying to hurt you. Because I GIVE A SHIT, which you clearly know nothing about. But had I known I’d be stuck with a pretentious, wannabe nihilist for the rest of my fucking life I'd have stayed far away, and I sure as hell would never have slept with you.
81) 23) dialog: What do you mean? Nyles looks to the Cops --

96) 7) dialog: I walked into a cave that sucked me into some type of hellish wormhole and now I’ve been stuck living the same day over and over again and I need to find a way out. The Librarian gives her a blank stare.

97) 4) dialog: -- BUT. Wait. You’re wrong. Hintz argued that a Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black hole would allow an observer access to the indeterministic universe on the other side of the Cauchy horizon. The Professor stares back.
97) 7) dialog: I think I got it. The Librarian smiles politely, then goes back to her work
98) 1) dialog: Still here, huh? 97. Nyles turns his head to see Sarah approaching -- and fall of his chair. He blinks to be sure he isn’t hallucinating
98) 3) dialog: Yup.
98) 5) dialog: Yeah. Well I can’t age.
98) 7) dialog: So, how you been?
98) 9) dialog: Are you done? Nyles thinks for a moment. Am I done?
98) 11) dialog: Good. I think I found a way out. off Nyles -- 98.

So, the general consensus is eradicate the energy source and all should reset. She looks at Nyles, preoccupied and clearly not following
99) 2) dialog: Nature prevents time travel. The earthquake broke nature.
99) 4) dialog: No, listen, this is serious. Sarah leans forward and grabs her PURSE from the vanity -
99) 7) dialog: Then get ready. I'll finish up. Erin puts her hands up, glad to be done, and leaves. Sarah takes out LIPSTICK and draws a DIAGRAM on the mirro starting with a LONG TUBE -- 99.
99) 8) dialog: This is the cave. It’s also life, birth and death, our consciousness, the timeline we all live on, but it’s simpler to think of it solely as the cave. We enter here -- She circles the left entry --
99) 9) dialog: -- and what’s supposed to happen in life is we just walk through this tube to the other end, continuing on this regular timeline. But, much like an earthquake can break pipes underground, it broke our pipe. She circles a section of the tube --
99) 10) dialog: This is the part where it all turns orange, where we’re sucked in. For exactly 3.2 seconds we lose control of our bodies, and what’s happening is we’re being sucked down into this fissure caused by the earthquake, back to the moment we wake up. Sarah draws a line down from the fissure, back to the sta
99) 12) dialog: Nyles, focus. It’s really not that hard to understand. Here -- (circling the fissure again) This is a highly concentrated energy source. Remember, you said it yourself. Energy Is Everything. We're trapped in a box of energy. Sarah draws a BOX around the entire graphic.
99) 13) dialog: That's all this day is. A box of energy. (pointing to the fissure) We destroy the energy source in that 3.2 second window, we break the box. At least I think. Sarah goes back to applying her make-up, pleased with her 100.
99) 15) dialog: I don’t know, maybe we wake up and it’s today, maybe it’s twenty years from now, or we're dead under a pile of rocks. I can’t be sure of any of it, that’s why it’s a theory. But we have to try. Sarah’s making somewhat of a convincing argument, but Nyl remains skeptical.
99) 17) dialog: We blow up ourselves and the cave in that 3.2 second window. Then we're out. Sarah moves onto her mascara, so confident in her plan.
99) 19) dialog: Well, technically, I’ve spent no time on it, since this isn’t real time, it’s all time spent outside of time, but go on.
99) 21) dialog: This is different. She puts down her mascara and looks him in the eyes.
99) 22) dialog: I tested it. 101. Sarah moves into the BEDROOM and starts changing into her DRESS. Nyles is stuck on her last line though...
99) 24) dialog: I tried it with Spuds’ goat. I sent her into the cave, blew her up, and... she’s gone. I don’t know where she went, but she isn’t here anymore. (then) Zip me up. Nyles zips her dress, still unsure...
99) 26) dialog: Yeah. Crazy, right? So, get through today, don’t do anything too crazy, and tonight, meet me at the cave so we can peace the fuck out of this shithole. Sarah checks her dress in the armoire mirror. Nyles sits the bed, processing. Did she actually find a way out?
99) 28) dialog: What? No. What are you talking about? Sarah sits on the bed and begins lacing up on her shoes.
99) 30) dialog: Rush? Nyles, we've been stuck in here for an eternity.
99) 32) dialog: Holy shit. You’re scared to leave.
99) 34) dialog: What’s the difference?
99) 36) dialog: Everything we’re doing in here is meaningless. You know that, right? This isn’t real.
99) 38) dialog: You don’t love me. I’m literally the only other human being stuck in here with you.
99) 40) dialog: So, you're saying that out there, in the real world, with millions of choices, you'd still want to be with me? Nyles hesitates for a second too long... Sarah clocks it.
99) 42) dialog: Bullshit. You can’t possibly know that.
99) 44) dialog: Fuck no. Sarah heads back into the bathroom --
99) 46) dialog: You've lost your mind. Nyles stands --
99) 48) dialog: I want my life back, Nyles!
99) 50) dialog: How do you know about that? He sighs.
99) 53) dialog: Wow, YOU don’t judge ME? That’s rich coming from the guy who lied about us fucking “thousands of times.”
99) 55) dialog: Yeah, well apology not accepted. Good talk, Nyles. Don’t come with me, I don’t care. She turns to leave -- but he’s in the way.
99) 56) dialog: Can you move? If this is my last day, I’m not wasting it with you. Nyles stares back, he wants her to stay... but she won’t down. He steps aside and she leaves.

106) 3) dialog: Thanks Misty, that was great. Sarah looks directly at Tala throughout.
106) 4) dialog: Tala. My baby sister, Tala. What can I say that hasn’t been said? Heh... Even from this angle, I can see a very faint halo of light around your head -- hovering just above those angelic cheekbones. 106. Tala’ cheekbones radiate. Sarah sighs to herself, this is ridiculous... But sees Tala beaming at her... and actuall gets a little choked up. What are these feelings I’m feel
106) 5) dialog: This world is bizarre... things happen, life happens, and it’s easy to bear down and just go through the motions day after day, after day... But, my sweet little sis’, you are so open to the wonder of it all. You have this hopefulness that’s special and rare. Every morning you get up and you confidently charge forth toward the life you've dreamt up for yourself. Your joy, this joyous energy, it's contagious and it’s just...
106) 7) dialog: Staring at each other across the campfire --
106) 10) dialog: 
106) 11) dialog: .-. it’s everything. Sarah pauses, struck by the warmth of this memory. She swallows her vulnerability, and looks back at Tala --
106) 12) dialog: Big sisters are supposed to teach baby sisters, but I will today and forever, and ever and ever, be learning from you. The two sisters share a blissful, teary smile.
106) 13) dialog: So, now, Abe... Abe leans forward, expecting some kind words...
106) 14) dialog: You fucking hurt her and I’1l stab your little fucking dick with a fork, I swear to god. 107. Stunned reactions from the crowd. Sarah smiles, drops the mic, and walks off.

114) 3) dialog: How did you find the cave in the first place? You had to find it that first day at the wedding, but it’s like two miles from the party, not by any roads. What were you doing out there? Nyles takes a big bite of his burrito.
114) 4) dialog: Seriously. Honesty and communication are key to a healthy relationship.
114) 6) dialog: Yeah, because an answer is inherently satisfying. It satisfies the pursuit of truth. And I like truth. I get off on truth. Nyles stares directly at Sarah. 115.
114) 9) dialog: No. That’s pretentious. And dumb. Nyles ponders this for a moment. A small raft with the bo Tecate on it floats by.
114) 11) dialog: Beer?
