51) 18) dialog: Congratulations. You two managed to set a record. Opening at three hundred feet was pretty ballsy. Omar lands in the H. Followed by Henri and Charlie.
51) 19) dialog: I should fail the rest of you. You opened too early, people. You were all over that radar. But given the circumstances I’ll let you all off. {Kenji lands behind him) Except Kenji. Pack your bags. Kenji walks away from the group, ashamed.
