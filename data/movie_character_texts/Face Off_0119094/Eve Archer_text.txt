1) 10) text: Oh, never mind... The Janitor suddenly twitches, his eyes rolls up in his head.  As he gasps his last -- Castor heaves him down a stairwell.  Now we see the needle-thin custom stiletto in Castor's hand. Castor kicks the Janitor's mop and bucket down the stairs -- making everything look like an accident.
2) 0) text: The children's church choir -- 200 strong -- sing "Behold the Lamb of God."  Clergy and lay persons listen reverently. "Father" Castor strolls by the singers -- casually heading for the exit.  As he passes the risers, a teenage girl drops her sheet music at his feet. Returning it -- he whispers in her ear -- so close he's practically licking it.
10) 6) text: Then go home.  Tell Eve.
12) 0) text: Archer enters and sees his wife EVE.  Handsome, intelligent.
12) 3) dialog: She complimented for her 'F' in history with an 'A' in shoplifting... Archer marches into the kitchen -- noting the crate of Marlboros.  Jamie matter-of-factly pours herself coffee.
12) 8) dialog: Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
12) 10) dialog: Maybe because you taught her never to speak to strangers. (immediately regrets it)
12) 11) text: I'm sorry... that wasn't fair. Eve kisses his cheek -- then gathers up her doctor gear.
12) 12) dialog: I've got patients waiting.  Try again, Jon.  She hates you -- but she needs you.
12) 14) dialog: Jon -- what is it? But he's too overcome.  He starts to speak -- but can't.
12) 15) dialog: Is it -- him?  It's... it's over? Emotions avalanche across his face until he finally looks up.  Eve pulls him close -- a sheltering embrace for them both.
15) 4) text: Is that stick ever gonna fall out of his ass? Archer's well-built secretary -- KIM BREWSTER -- hands him his messages.  She's holding a bottle of Dom Perignon.
17) 2) text: That bomb was just a crossword puzzle to me... a mental exercise. I never built it... Lazarro shuts down the monitor... turns to Archer.
19) 0) text: Archer stares at the body... he can't believe it.
20) 4) text: Your situation, however, would be a little less permanent...
28) 0) text: Eve is in bed.  Archer comes in quietly and sits beside  her -- studying her peaceful, sleeping face.  She stirs.
28) 1) dialog: I was dreaming...
28) 3) dialog: I'm not sure... you were flying this weird old stunt plane... doing flips... walking on the wings... I was watching from the ground -- when you fell.  You had a parachute, but you wouldn't open it.
28) 5) dialog: No.
28) 7) dialog: I don't know... (nuzzles him)
28) 8) text: Maybe because you've never needed my help.
28) 10) dialog: ... Maybe I did... (teasing)
28) 11) text: ... maybe I didn't... They kiss affectionately.  Passion building, Eve runs her hands over his body -- until her fingers touch a round scar on his chest.  Archer freezes -- mid-caress.
28) 12) dialog: It's all right, Jon.
28) 14) dialog: And you wouldn't be. No response.  The pain hidden in his silence chills Eve.
28) 15) dialog: Things will get better now that you're home.  Everything will be better -- now that... that man is finally out of our lives.
28) 18) dialog: Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again...
28) 20) dialog: You said you'd be here!  You promised!  What could be more important than that?
28) 22) dialog: You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  Go! Fury erupting, Eve pushes Archer out of the bed.
32) 7) text: (INTERCUT huge video screen enlargements of Archer and Castor's body parts as necessary): Globules of adipose tissue are siphoned off Archer's  obliques.  At the same time... Hoag recreates the "Great Sphinx" tattoo on Archer's thigh.  We PUSH IN ON his leg, then PULL BACK to reveal... Archer and Tito.  The CLOSE UP on his leg becomes a FULL SHOT as he walks across the rooftop -- like himself. Tito demonstrated the proper "Castor gait": dangerously casual, like a panther. Hoag reproduces Castor's fingerprints... then layers them over Archer's fingers. Archer practices Castor's icy, killer glare.  Tito hands him a lit cigarette.  Archer brings the cigarette to his lips -- then coughs harshly.  But he keeps trying. Castor smiles... then smirks and laughs.  PULL BACK to reveal Archer studying surveillance footage of Castor on a monitor-screen -- mimicking him. Archer fusses with his new hair, trying to cover the thin spots.  Giving  up, he zips up his sweatshirt -- getting the zipper caught in his new chest hair.

46) 0) text: Castor's body lies inert.  His life-support MACHINES BLIPPING away.  Until the EEG spikes.  Once -- twice --  three times.  Brain wave activity increases -- and  stabilizes. Castor's fingers twitch.  Then his fist clenches -- hard. Castor's head is swathed in gauze.  But his eyes pop  open. Reflexively, Castor wrenches from the bed -- tearing out  the tubes and wires that tether him to life support.  He  goes down -- in agony -- groaning. He struggles to his feet -- staggering through the lab -- until he catches the reflection of his bandaged face in the window.  He quickly unwraps the gauze. The discarded bandages fall at his feet... we don't see what CASTOR sees -- but we hear him MOAN... then CHOKE... then SCREAM -- the only moment Castor ever loses his cool. Finally composing himself -- Castor's hand grips the phone and he dials.
52) 2) text: I torched every shred of evidence that proves who you are.  So swallow this -- you are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
54) 4) dialog: I suppose it was only a matter of time before you forgot where we lived.

54) 10) dialog: I've got surgery.
54) 12) dialog: Don't try to charm me -- I'm still angry.  There're leftovers in the fridge.

56) 0) text: Castor sifts through Christmas cards from holidays past, studying the ones with photos.  He's memorizing --  matching names to faces -- Wanda's, Buzz's, Lazarro's,  etc. Something else catches his eye.  He finds a floral notebook -- Eve's diary -- and pages through it.  Then, he reads:
70) 0) text: A tired Eve opens the door.  It's pitch black inside.  As she fumbles for the light switch...
70) 4) dialog: Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?

70) 9) dialog: Isn't that what all this is about? The wine, cooking me dinner -- your next assignment?
70) 11) dialog: You always say that -- then you leave.
70) 13) dialog: Jon, that's not true --
70) 17) dialog: Your what?
70) 19) dialog: Jon... that's wonderful.
71) 0) text: Castor carries Eve into the shower and spins on the  water. He rips her blouse open -- on her like a vulture to  carrion.  As they drop to the floor of the stall -- water filling up around them -- Castor licks her ear and whispers...
75) 0) text: Two guards watch Archer and Dubov disappear off the clinic's monitor.  They grab their shock-sticks and rush for the door. The door opens -- revealing Dubov and Archer.  Perfectly in synch -- they double cold-cock the startled guards. Archer grabs a shock-stick -- and fuses the door shut. He yanks out wires and shatters the computers.  Dubov mimics the behavior -- ripping out an entire console -- and revealing a narrow cable duct. Flames explode -- shorting the circuitry -- the DRONING HUM RISES -- the magnetic power monitor shows a dangerous surge.
77) 0) text: Archer and Dubov find themselves in a multi-level labyrinth.  A hundred feet high -- criss-crossed with catwalks, staircases and high walls. ECHOES resound -- SHOUTING, FOOTSTEPS GETTING CLOSER -- they seem to be coming from all around them. Over the magnetic HUM -- Archer notices loose screws and other metal debris stuck to the sheer wall.  He pulls one screw away -- and lets it fly back into the polarized wall. Archer gets an idea -- and looks back the way they came.
79) 0) text: Archer's blinded -- it's daytime in the real world. A sea gull flies across his face -- as we FOLLOW the bird...

81) 0) text: Eve's asleep.  Castor, dressed, looks down at her like  Cortez at Montezuma -- triumphant, with overwhelming  power.
82) 1) dialog: Last night, I thought -- this isn't my husband. He pockets the smoke.  Eve is there, dressed somberly.
82) 2) dialog: Then I woke up in the middle of the night -- and found you passed out in the study.
82) 5) dialog: Jon, you know what day it is.  I know it's difficult for you, but we still have to go.
82) 7) dialog: 'Protect and serve' later.  You're going.
83) 2) dialog: I don't know... they're about the same ages we were when we met. (smiles)
83) 5) text: By the way, you never said anything about last night... He moves closer, stroking her hair as his BEEPER sounds.
83) 6) dialog: Aren't you going to get that? He turns his beeper off, then touches her lips with his finger.  Without knowing exactly why, Eve tenses up.
83) 7) dialog: Jon -- this is hardly the time or place. Castor looks around in surprise because he sees she's  driving into --
84) 0) text: It's beautiful here, striking and sad.  Now on foot, Castor follows Eve up a bluff, through a phalanx of  graves -- with no idea where she's leading him. Finally she stops at a crucifix-topped headstone.  Castor joins her and reads the etched marble stone: Matthew Archer, Age 5 Beloved Son &amp; Brother We Cherish You Always
84) 1) text: Stunned, Castor watches as Eve kneels beside the marker.
84) 2) dialog: Happy birthday, Matty. She places a few child's toys on the marker... a shark... a little bulldozer... a spaceship.  Overwhelmed with  grief, she collapses into Castor.

89) 5) text: Jon?  Hello? INTERCUT Archer and Eve as necessary.
89) 7) dialog: Who is this?
89) 9) dialog: Whoever you are -- don't call again... CLICK.  Archer sags in futility.  A SIREN snaps him back to reality. Archer goes to the window and carefully peers out. A squad CAR ROARS INTO VIEW -- then continues on its way.
91) 0) text: The automatic door lifts -- revealing Tito's old Buick. The big V-8 RUMBLES as Archer pulls out.  He doesn't get far as... menacing CHOLOS block his way.

112) 0) text: Alone -- Castor picks up the framed photo of Eve and Jamie -- staring at it with unbridled hatred. Fury rising, he crumples the frame -- and the photo -- in his clenching grip.  He hurls it into other Archer family memorabilia -- shattering more photos and souvenirs. Only then does Castor notice Lazarro standing in the doorway.  For how long -- he can't be sure.
115) 0) text: Skirting a roadblock, Archer appears to be coming undone... wobbly, wild-eyed... he suddenly picks up a trash can and carries it down the street in front of his face. Pedestrians gawk at this madman.  What's he doing? Archer finally stops in front of a sporting goods store. He swings the trash can.  SMASH!  The store's WINDOW SHATTERS.  An ALARM BLARES. Passersby stare at Archer for a moment -- stunned.  Then several youths leap into the window and start pulling merchandise out of the store. Mayhem as others join in... clerks rush out to do battle. An LAPD squad car hauls up onto the curb.  A cop leaps out and chases as the looters scatter. The driver stands at his door, radio in hand.  Sensing something, he turns... just as Archer grabs the canister of Comply-Gas from the cop's belt. Archer sprays him in the face.  The cop gags and sags. Archer quickly slips behind the wheel. Inside:  Archer hits a switch -- the car's tinted windows darken automatically, obscuring him from the outside.  He HITS the GAS -- SCREAMING away.
120) 3) text: Where's everyone else?
121) 5) dialog: I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --

122) 14) dialog: (returns the embrace)

123) 2) dialog: What was what?
123) 4) dialog: Probably a mosquito -- I'll close the window. Eve rubs Castor's shoulder blade until he falls asleep.   She gets up, closes the window, then goes into the bathroom.
124) 0) text: Eve takes a breath, then produces a lancet from her pocket.  She squeezes the lancet -- and a drop of blood splashes into a glass vial -- Castor's blood.

127) 6) dialog: I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
127) 8) dialog: Tell me... tell me about the all- night dentist. As Archer speaks -- Eve searches his eyes for the truth.
127) 10) text: And even though it must have hurt -- you still kissed me. Eve slowly puts the gun down, fighting off tears.
127) 11) dialog: Christ, Jon!  How could you put us in this position?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me...?

136) 24) text: Lars -- take Jamie, bring the car around, then meet us at that boathouse... Guests head for their cars.  Eve seizes the moment and steps over to Wanda and Buzz.
