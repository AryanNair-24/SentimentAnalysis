"Father" Castor strolls by the singers -- casually heading for the exit.  As he passes the risers, a teenage girl drops her sheet music at his feet. Returning it -- he whispers in her ear -- so close he's practically licking it.
2) 1) dialog: I've never enjoyed 'The Messiah.' But your voice makes even a hack like Handel seem like a genius. He pats her behind and leaves.  Although a little shaken, she's also drawn by Castor's sexual magnetism.

9) 3) dialog: Wherever they put you, I'll find a way to get you out... Pollux starts FIRING -- covering Castor as he runs through a tunnel which leads to an adjoining hangar. Suddenly Wanda presses her machine-pistol into Pollux's head.  As Pollux raises his gun -- Tito grabs his hand.
9) 7) dialog: Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.

Enraged, Archer steps boldly forward -- trying to draw his enemy out.  Silence -- then Archer senses... Castor is behind him.  He FIRES -- Archer dives away. The BARRAGE CONTINUES -- driving Archer back between two huge turbine engines.  As Archer reloads, he stares at the control panel switches. Castor moves in for the kill when he hears a final SNAP- SNAP.  Except it isn't a finger snap... it's two switches. VRRRROOOM!  The TWIN ENGINES ROAR on!  Unable to fight the churning tornado-force wind... Castor's blasted across the hangar... slamming hard into the far wall. The ENGINES STOP and Archer emerges -- joined by Tito.

Hoag recreates the "Great Sphinx" tattoo on Archer's thigh.  We PUSH IN ON his leg, then PULL BACK to reveal... Archer and Tito.  The CLOSE UP on his leg becomes a FULL SHOT as he walks across the rooftop -- like himself. Tito demonstrated the proper "Castor gait": dangerously casual, like a panther. Hoag reproduces Castor's fingerprints... then layers them over Archer's fingers. Archer practices Castor's icy, killer glare.  Tito hands him a lit cigarette.  Archer brings the cigarette to his lips -- then coughs harshly.  But he keeps trying. Castor smiles... then smirks and laughs.  PULL BACK to reveal Archer studying surveillance footage of Castor on a monitor-screen -- mimicking him. Archer fusses with his new hair, trying to cover the thin spots.  Giving  up, he zips up his sweatshirt -- getting the zipper caught in his new chest hair.

Castor's fingers twitch.  Then his fist clenches -- hard. Castor's head is swathed in gauze.  But his eyes pop  open. Reflexively, Castor wrenches from the bed -- tearing out  the tubes and wires that tether him to life support.  He  goes down -- in agony -- groaning. He struggles to his feet -- staggering through the lab -- until he catches the reflection of his bandaged face in the window.  He quickly unwraps the gauze. The discarded bandages fall at his feet... we don't see what CASTOR sees -- but we hear him MOAN... then CHOKE... then SCREAM -- the only moment Castor ever loses his cool. Finally composing himself -- Castor's hand grips the phone and he dials.

61) 9) dialog: That's just the bottom of the food chain.  Pollux -- what would happen if somebody planted a bomb on Air Force One?
61) 11) dialog: Pissed-off, vulnerable... looking for someone to step in, take charge, give them hope again. What if that someone was an F.B.I. hero?  A true Boy Scout and family man -- with a spotless past. Imagine where that guy could land -- if the timing's right.
61) 13) dialog: Not yet he isn't.  But after you 'confess' -- you'll be a free man. And I'll be on my way...
63) 5) dialog: Evacuate your team, Captain.

70) 2) dialog: Don't tell me you forgot.  Eve -- it's date night!
70) 5) dialog: It's important to keep some mystery... so things stay... unpredictable. Eve studies him as he pours her more wine.  Her smile slowly fades as she realizes what's going on.
70) 8) dialog: Gone?
70) 10) dialog: I'm not going anywhere.
70) 12) dialog: I bet I deserved that.  I bet Jon Archer is the most inattentive, sexless spouse on Earth.

70) 15) dialog: -- brown eyes. He smells her hair, then her shoulders, her skin.  She's aroused, but wary.  So Castor goes in for the kill.
70) 16) dialog: I wanted it all to be just right... when I told you about my promotion.
70) 18) dialog: Well, I don't have it yet.  But Lazarro's getting old -- he won't be around forever.  And I'm getting the itch to move up.
