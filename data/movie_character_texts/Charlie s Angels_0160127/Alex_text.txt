TWO GUNMEN with silenced SNIPER rifles fan out on the fake city street.
94) 0) text: Alex races out of the soundstage and jumps into her car, parked nearby. The Gunmen emerge from the stage and spot her, just as she gets the car started. She peels out as a hail of gunfire just misses her windshield.

135) 21) dialog: Jason, get down! Alex spins out of the Thin Man's grasp and does a full roundhouse kick, knocking the gun out of the Thin Man's hands. The Thin Man immediately responds, throwing two quick punches, which Alex expertly blocks and then follow with a hitch-kick to the chin. Jason, dazed and confused, thinks he must be hallucinatin

136) 1) dialog: Right now, just by leaning forward, I could crush your windpipe. You'd die a slow and painful death. You don't want that, do you?
136) 5) dialog: Where is the bomb, when's it going off? She presses harder.
137) 0) text: Jason slams out into the stairwell, looking for Alex. He finds her on her walkie talkie, the Thin Man handcuffed to the staircase.
