7) 12) dialog: Get off my back, Sanchez.   I know what I'm doing. REVEAL ALEX, her face right next to his.

7) 16) dialog: That's why I'm gonna say blue. He makes a "snip" motion.     They both breathe a sigh of
7) 21) dialog: That's my job. Alex kisses him. It's a damn good kiss.          Jason's it, but pulls away for a second.
7) 22) dialog: I don't think Sanchez would kiss me. He's a forty-year-old man. Pull back to reveal... ALEX and JASON are in a fully macked out Airstream, sitting on a bed, leaning over an open screenplay. We can tell from our surroundings that Jason is a big deal Hollywood action star, and this trailer is his home away from home. She licks the bridge of his nose, then kisses him again.

8) 1) dialog: So when you coming back?
8) 3) dialog: Oh, great, that's helpful. (watching her prepare to go)
8) 6) dialog: You ask me, your boss is an asshole. (beat)
8) 12) dialog: Yeah, well I think you should quit.
8) 14) dialog: I need you. Alex looks back -- that was more personally revealing than she expected. A P.A. comes up next to Jason.
8) 16) dialog: I gotta go save the world. Alex smiles at the irony of that.
93) 0) text: Jason and Alex are walking down a beautiful, tree-lined cobblestone street, holding hands. The buildings and outdoor cafes are reminiscent of a quaint, vaguely European town.
93) 4) dialog: Alex, I can't tell you how happy I am you came.
93) 6) dialog: No, I mean, it's weird. It's weirding me out how happy I am when you're around. Am I sick or something?
93) 9) dialog: The only bummer is, I start to jones when you're not around. What the hell am I gonna do this weekend, if you're not with me?
93) 11) dialog: Hey.   Wait a second.   Come with me!
93) 13) dialog: Miami, on the Sony Jet. I've got two tickets to the Final Four.
93) 15) dialog: Wait, before you say no, let me just say something, okay? I'm sick of how little we see each other. I'm sick of stealing a day here, or a week there.
93) 17) dialog: What if I changed all that?
93) 22) dialog: What if I told you to quit your job, and come live with me. What I'm saying, Alex, is that I want you to... BLAM!    BLAM!   Gunshots ring out!
93) 25) dialog: Fine.  I'm fine. (he laughs)
93) 28) dialog: Fake guns, too. They're just setting up for the next scene. He helps her up.
93) 30) dialog: (smiling)
95) 0) text: Jason has just gotten his squibs refitted. He's facing the opposite direction, so he doesn't see Alex's car whizz away in the background.
96) 0) text: Jason walks into the Soundstage, followed by the effects
96) 1) dialog: Alex?     ALEX? Of course, she's nowhere to be found. While he looks around, one of the effects guys fingers a bullet hole in the set wall. He presses against it and a FLATTENED BULLET FALLS OUT. He thinks for a moment, then shakes his head.   Couldn't

132) 1) dialog: Yes, yes! When suddenly, the door to the luxury box is flung open.
132) 3) text: Charlie!? Charles Townsend! Jason whips around and locks eyes with Alex.
132) 4) dialog: Alex?
132) 7) dialog: ALEX!    Hey... While everyone watches, confused, Jason pushes his way through the box and follows Alex into the hall.
135) 7) dialog: Alex?!   Jesus, what is going on? The Thin Man and Alex turn around to face Jason, who is sweaty and exasperated from chasing her.
135) 10) dialog: No you can talk to me NOW. I want to know what the hell is going on. First, you disappear with no explanation, not even a goodbye.
135) 12) dialog: Now, I see you here, but you're with some other guy.
135) 14) dialog: Lemme guess.   You must be Charlie?
135) 19) dialog: No, no I'm sick of this shit. I'm sick of this asshole telling you what you can and can't do. And then, with no warning, he hauls off and punches the Thin Man. Now, Jason's just an actor, not an ass-kicking super detective, so his punch isn't all that great. In fact, it leaves Jason shaking his hand in pain. The Thin Man, a trickle of blood running from his lip, sm
135) 22) dialog: What the hell is going on? What's going on is a world class ass-kicking, courtesy of girlfriend. While the action star watches in amazement, A unloads an arsenal of bad ass kung fu moves that would ma Jet Li green with envy. The Thin Man doesn't stand a chance. A flying side kick sends him stumbling backwards into the stairwell. We follow the fight...
137) 0) text: Jason slams out into the stairwell, looking for Alex. He finds her on her walkie talkie, the Thin Man handcuffed to the staircase.
137) 6) dialog: Yeah, I can see that.

137) 14) dialog: Go save the world, honey. (beat)
