20) 1) dialog: The average investor sees technology stocks as discrete entities, "This one is up 50 points, this one is down 10." It's only through derivative analysis that one sees the real power of that sector. A few nods.    She makes a good point.
20) 3) dialog: Well, there are so many options. I mean, who can say what the one best choice is?
20) 7) dialog: For my money, Keppler-Wilson is a strong choice. More nods, ad-libbed agreement.        The Broker Guy is Excusing herself, Dylan turns and subtly touches her ear, where she's wearing a hidden radio.

He shots out the pipes over their heads, sending down a cascade of hot water. Dylan and Natalie scramble back to avoid getting scalded. Other pipes SHATTER from the change in pressure, leading to an interior thunderstorm. Steam fills the room as an inch of water grows on the floor. Natalie and Dylan push rolling laundry carts in the Thin Man's direction. He shoots at them, but quickly realizes they're just trying to waste his bullets. Holstering one of his guns, he dials his cell phone.
25) 7) dialog: As she creeps up behind the cover of the rolling laundry carts. She's succeeded in circling behind the Thin Man as he talks on the phone. She clears her throat.      The Thin Man turns.   She kic him in the jaw. Knocked back, he drops the phone, which CRACKS and slips under a washing machine. He crab-walks back, then suddenly springs back to his fee We weren't expecting that kind of ninja move out of this

He's wearing lederhosen, with a feather in his hat. Natalie begins to YODEL. Dylan hands a fancy envelope to the bewildered thug. Thug Two is approaching from behind, curious what the hell is going on. Dylan begins to TALK-SING a song in German about a too- curious goat and his worried mistress. Even with the pant we have no idea what's happening. It seems wholesome, but occasionally one of the girls touches the other in a weirdly coquettish, oddly sexual way. Thug Two looks at the address on the envelope.

Turning to the thugs, they each lean in to WHISPER into a different thug's ear. As the men smile, the angels suddenly BONK the two men's heads together. Both men fall, knocked out. Stepping over the bodies, Dylan heads inside.
