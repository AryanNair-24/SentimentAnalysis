Jailers wrench two crusaders from their cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER DUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their faces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk.
3) 7) dialog: No!... I took the bread.
3) 9) dialog: They're not interested in truth. You are too weak, Peter. You would not live through it. The Interrogator stares into Robin's eyes.
3) 12) dialog: And this is English courage. He hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his fast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword. Slash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at him. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest. Despite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator. Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the furnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the fire. Screaming.
3) 18) dialog: You speak English?
3) 23) dialog: What I would give for an English sword. This is a pruning hook. A guard swings at him with a giant axe.    Robin slashes. shears the axe handle in two.
3) 24) dialog: Hmm!   Not bad. He runs the man through. Peter loses his sword. His opponent moves in for the kill... Peter grabs tongs from the fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand. Commotion outside.    RAISED VOICES and RUNNING FEET.
3) 29) dialog: Why should we trust you?
3) 31) dialog: He makes a point. The door bursts open.    More guards rush in.
3) 32) dialog: A good point. He slashes the man free.
3) 34) dialog: Whatever blood is in his veins, he does not deserve to die here.
4) 0) text: They wade through foul water up to their waists. The Saracen leads... A snake lashes out for his face. Robin lops off its head.
4) 2) dialog: Five years I've waited for the smell of free air. That makes a man fast. Guards drop down from above, carrying torches.    Blockin the way.
4) 11) dialog: Amen, brother. A bloodcurdling scream. A pursuing guard tumbles down the sewer chute. The three men press themselves against the wall. The man hurtles by... is impaled on the spikes. A draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. Using the spiked guard as a ladder, Robin climbs. Removes a grating.
5) 0) text: Robin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of mounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears. All clear. They're outside the prison wall. Robin helps Peter up.
5) 1) dialog: God willing, we may now be safe.
5) 5) dialog: Come, Peter.    We must hurry. Raising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers.
5) 7) dialog: Hold on to my shoulder. Peter shakes him off.
5) 11) dialog: (reluctantly) I swear it. Summoning hidden resources of strength, Peter charges at the oncoming soldiers, brandishing his sword.
5) 16) dialog: Farewell, friend. God speed you on your way.
5) 18) dialog: I go to England.
5) 20) dialog: England?   Why?
5) 22) dialog: Go your own way. I relieve you of your obligation.
5) 24) dialog: And if I don't want you?
5) 27) dialog: Robin of Locksley. You know a short route to England, Aslan?
10) 0) text: A twelfth century French sailboat at anchor.    A cross o its sail. A longboat rows to shore. Robin stands in the prow, in a pilgrim's hooded robe. He gazes at the approaching land. Unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades to the beach. He kneels, pressing his hands and face into the soil.
10) 1) dialog: Home.    Thank you, Lord. Aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. The French sailors keep their distance from him. Robin takes his hand.
10) 2) dialog: My friend, you have escorted me home. I beg you to free yourself of your vow. Return with the boat. I know how heavy your heart must be, this far from your family and native land...
10) 4) dialog: I thought you'd say that. He nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. The Saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him into the surf. He turns a cold stare on Robin.
10) 7) dialog: Come, Aslan. By nightfall we will celebrate your honor when we dine with my father.
12) 0) text: Nearing home, Robin is buoyant.     The Saracen, brooding walks two paces behind him.
12) 1) dialog: Why must you walk in back of me?
12) 3) dialog: Our races have fought for a hundred years to prove that point.
12) 5) dialog: For an 'infidel' you have uncommon clarity of thinking. Yet you refuse to tell me about your home and family.
12) 7) dialog: You speak my language. You have the diplomacy and honor code of a nobleman. I ask again, why were you to be executed? The Saracen maintains a moody silence.
12) 8) dialog: So, I must continue with my guesswork. You are highborn? Probably... You fell from favor... Clearly... Why? You broke the law? You were a rival for power? ... A woman?
12) 12) dialog: By the Lord, that's it! Aslan is silent, but Robin knows he's right.
12) 13) dialog: They say there are Arab women of such beauty that they can possess a man's mind, that he would be willing to die for them. Is that not so? Ignoring him, the Saracen stops.      Examines the darken sky.
12) 15) dialog: Your people must marry women chosen for them by others, right? No reply.    Aslan unfolds a prayer rug.
12) 16) dialog: Who is she? The Mullah's daughter? ... Another man's wife?... That's it!
12) 18) dialog: You dog! You painted old dog! What is her name?
12) 20) dialog: Her name?
12) 22) dialog: Her name?
12) 28) dialog: Ah, Jasmina!    Is she beautiful?
12) 30) dialog: That way. Aslan throws his rug on the ground.    Kneels.
12) 32) dialog: I would know blindfolded. I'm five miles from home... Was she worth it?
12) 35) dialog: Hold!... I am curious as to what manner of creature is so fearsome that it takes six men to attack it. Shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches them.
12) 40) dialog: Have we treed the devil himself? Let me see... Ah ha! A small boy. A truly dangerous animal.
12) 42) dialog: Wrong. This is my land, and my tree. Therefore, whatever is in it also belongs to me.
12) 44) dialog: The man who strikes that tree dies. He glances nervously at Aslan, who's still at his prayers. The men stop in mid-swing. More surprised than scared. Gisborne gestures to the largest of them.
12) 46) dialog: (backing up) Perhaps we could discuss this. The soldier raises his sword. Robin lifts his cape... the crossbow. Shoots from the hip. The bolt thuds through the man's armor. He's dead before he lands.
12) 48) dialog: Aslan!   It's time to redeem that vow.
12) 53) dialog: Aslan, get off your damn knees! I have four of them cornered. The Saracen remains head down. Or did we see him steal a glance? Gisborne signals his men to attack. A wave of flashing steel.
12) 54) dialog: I hope there's enough of me to satisfy you all. Backed up to a tree, he grabs a branch and kicks out. Two men fly back. He lunges at a third. His sword strikes flesh. Robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth onto a sharp tree stump. Gisborne thrusts. Robin reacts too slowly.       Blood fl from his arm. His sword falls.
12) 55) dialog: Aslan!! Gisborne is on him, sword pressed to his back.      Robin freezes.
12) 58) dialog: On your knees, Gisborne.   Pray. He obeys.    Robin raises his sword.
12) 63) dialog: Now get off my land. And tell your cousin the Sheriff what happens to his scum when they pick on my people. Gisborne takes off, colliding with Aslan as he folds his rug. Reacts in shock at the sight of the strange Arab. Keeps running.
12) 64) dialog: (to Aslan, furious) You worthless savage! You travel ten thousand miles to save my life, then leave me to be butchered.
12) 66) dialog: Which does not include prayer times, meal times, or any time I'm outnumbered six to one!!
12) 68) dialog: Barely. Aslan examines Robin's wound.   Dismissive.
12) 70) dialog: After six years of the stench of death, I have no stomach for needless blood on my hands. Wulf climbs cautiously from the tree.
12) 71) dialog: Have no fear, boy. The boy nervously eyes Robin and the Saracen, fingering a crucifix around his neck. Runs off into the woods.
12) 76) dialog: Ha!   It was you he was scared of. Aslan's humor is infectious.     Robin's anger relents.
12) 77) dialog: Come, my strange friend. Beyond that hill lies the prettiest little castle in all Christendom. Warm hearths, hot food, real beds.
12) 79) dialog: With feather pillows. Warm and soft like Jasmina's embrace.
13) 0) text: Ruins. The moon hovers ominously over the once-proud castle. Burned to the ground. Gutted and deserted. Towers demolished. Moat drained. Robin stares, struck dumb with horror. The dark courtyard.   Heartsick, Robin stumbles over debris.
13) 1) dialog: Father!    Hello! His VOICE ECHOES around the fallen battlements. Aslan places a hand on his shoulder and points... Suspended high on a tower wall is a decaying human corpse.
13) 3) dialog: Noooooo! A paroxysm of rage and grief. He smashes furniture. Slams his fists relentlessly into the wall. Pained, Aslan looks on.
13) 4) dialog: I should have been here. Spent, he leans against the wall. In the silence, they hear an eerie TAPPING. Robin draws his sword... A hunched, old man emerges, walking with the aid of a staff ... Duncan.
13) 8) dialog: (shaking him) Damn you, Duncan. Why didn't you cut him down?
13) 10) dialog: You left my father to hang like a common thief, carrion for the crows.
13) 12) dialog: What has happened?
13) 14) dialog: Did they have witnesses?
13) 16) dialog: Did you believe the charges?
13) 18) dialog: Who did this to you, Duncan?
17) 0) text: Red shards of sunlight slice through mist-shrouded trees. Robin hammers a crude cross over a hillside grave. Heads bowed, Duncan and Aslan stand at his side.
17) 1) dialog: Our last words in this world were spoken in anger. He called the Crusades a foolish quest, said it was vanity to force other men to our religion. He was right. (looks to Aslan, then back to the grave) Please forgive me, Father.
17) 3) dialog: I failed him. I should have been here at his side.
17) 5) dialog: Leave me.
17) 10) dialog: Leave me.
17) 28) dialog: I swear by my own blood. I will not rest until I have restored my father's name. (a whisper) ... Or until I am dead.
18) 1) dialog: We make a fine army, do we not, Duncan? A blind man, an Arab, and a fool.
18) 3) dialog: This is summer.
18) 5) dialog: Why, pray?
18) 10) dialog: You despair too soon, Aslan. We shall find food and shelter here among friends.
18) 12) dialog: Peter's home. It is nearly seven years since we left here together.
19) 0) text: Robin pounds on the door.    A hatch opens.     An OLD WO face.
19) 2) dialog: Open up! A pause.   The hatch slides back.
19) 3) dialog: Tell the mistress of the house that Robin of Locksley is at her door.
19) 5) dialog: Aagh! He shouts through the hatch, over his bruised fingers.
19) 9) dialog: Is the child Marian at home?
20) 3) dialog: I am Robin of Locksley.
20) 5) dialog: I may meet my maker soon from lack of sustenance. But for now I am real enough.
20) 10) dialog: By heaven, am I to dance next? Who are you?
20) 12) dialog: Then show yourself, child.     For we knew each other well.
20) 14) dialog: You know I am not one of them. Besides, I am sworn to protect you.
20) 16) dialog: Allow that years of war and prison may change a man. Step forward, Marian, so I may see how you have changed. She moves into the light... Fat.     Rotten teeth.   Ugly sin.
20) 17) dialog: Er... the years have been kind.
20) 20) dialog: Wait, Marian!    ...ouch!
20) 24) dialog: You are truly courageous against an unarmed man. The figure gestures towards the door. Robin sidesteps. Slams an elbow. The sword drops. Slides across the floor. Robin moves for it, but the man intercepts, drawing a dagger. Robin darts to the wall. Rips off an antlered deer head. Defends himself as the attacker slashes at the horns.
20) 28) dialog: Marian.
22) 0) text: Rock-strewn hills. Grazing sheep. Sun peeking through clouds. Robin and Marian walk. Anger and anguish in her voice.
22) 2) dialog: We were together five terrible years in a Saracen prison.
22) 4) dialog: Marian, I'm sorry.
22) 6) dialog: On my return, I found my father dead. The Sheriff denounced him as a Druid and took our lands.
22) 11) dialog: Why do you not join your mother in London? You would be safer there.
22) 13) dialog: The you must allow me to be your guardian.
22) 16) dialog: Marian, I don't want to replace him.
22) 25) dialog: I killed some of the Sheriff's men. I fear I have placed you in danger.
22) 27) dialog: I'm not leaving. Marian ices him with a glare. Aslan reappears, with two bareback horses. Soldiers appear on the crest, led by Gisborne... With a mischievous grin, Marian runs to the soldiers.
22) 29) dialog: Damn the girl! Aslan, can you ride? In answer, Aslan grins. Leaps onto a horse. With a single swift move he hoists Duncan up behind him and digs in his heels. The mare leaps forward, and over the estate wall.
22) 30) dialog: He can ride. He heads his horse at the wall. It stumbles. Barely clears it. Stones fly. Robin struggles to hold on. Marian stands directly in Gisborne's path.
23) 0) text: Water erupts under hooves. Aslan fords a stream. Duncan hangs on for dear life. Robin strives to keep up. Half a mile behind Gisborne splits up his men. Trying for a short cut, Robin finds himself at the steepest part of the river gorge. His horse balks at the drop. Robin flails at his mount with hands and feet. It backs away.
23) 1) dialog: Damn you, animal! Aslan shouts from the far bank.
23) 7) dialog: Of course I've had a woman! Come on, pretty one. He pats the horse soothingly.    The animal edges forward
23) 9) dialog: I know!   I know! The soldiers reload.   Robin urges the horse at the steep drop.
23) 10) dialog: Easy, easy. Another wave of crossbow bolts. Robin launches the frightened animal into space. Hooves flail... touch down. Scramble up the other bank. Robin enthusiastically pats the horse's neck.
23) 11) dialog: I love you! The first two pursuers misjudge their leaps.     Their mounts land sprawling in the riverbed.
23) 13) dialog: What is your pleasure, Gisborne?
23) 15) dialog: You survived one meeting.    Our next will be your last.
23) 17) dialog: That's a lie!
23) 22) text: Come, Robin! He is trying to anger you into a trap. A shaft pierces the flank of Robin's horse. It rears in fright. Robin clings on. Six soldiers, the men Gisborne split off, are climbing the embankment towards him. Robin regains control. Rides right at them. Scatters them, and takes off again. Gisborne yells at his men to follow. Robin and Aslan ride flat out. Open land turns to scrub. Seeing no followers, Robin pulls up and dismounts.
23) 23) dialog: We have lost them. I'll lame this mare if I ask her to go any farther. He gently extracts the shaft from his horse. Aslan opens his pouch. Pulls out two shiny clear pebbles and a square leather hide. Rolls the pebbles into the tube and holds it to his eye. A primitive telescope. Robin watches, curious.
23) 35) dialog: God knows! Aslan laughs.   Robin points towards an endless expanse o trees. ROBIN
23) 37) text: Sherwood is haunted, Master. ROBIN
23) 38) text: Either we take our chances with the ghosts, or become ghosts ourselves. He remounts. They race into the trees. Gisborne's men thunder up,... slowing as they enter the forest. Peering around them in trepidation, they slowly rein in. Robin looks back. ROBIN
23) 46) dialog: Be quiet!    Listen. WIND GUSTS the trees in angry waves. Emits deathly SHRIEKS. The HORSES WHINNEY. Unnerved, Aslan smites around him with his scimitar. Wheels at the sounds, striking only air. ASLAN
23) 47) text: Allah protect us from the evil spirits. Duncan clings to his back.   Robin points.
23) 48) dialog: Behind you! Aslan slashes out, futilely.
23) 49) dialog: No, there!    And there! Aslan flails.   Robin cracks up. ASLAN
23) 50) text: Cease your mad laughing.     I can feel them. Robin reaches into the branches. Pulls out a string of hollowed wooden tubes -- WINDCHIMES. Dozens of such strings on all the trees. He blows over the hollow end. A low chilling MOAN. ROBIN
23) 51) text: Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A child's toy put to good use. You scare easily, my painted Saladin. His laughter is broken by a piercing YELL. A red- jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope. Catapults him to the ground. The bushes are instantly alive. Shaggy, wild-eyed men, armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. Twelfth- century Hell's Angels. The red-jacketed young turk, WILL SCARLET, leaps around Robin. WILL SCARLET
23) 53) dialog: Aslan! Aslan makes no move to intervene.
23) 57) text: Atishoo, Atishoo. We all fall down. Beg for mercy, rich man. ROBIN
23) 59) text: Yeah, bollocks, mate. Robin looks up... I mean up! A towering figure. Seven feet of grinning, muscled brute. The giant extends a vice that passes for a hand. Hauls Robin to his feet. His eyes twinkle with merriment. His whole body shakes when he laughs, which is often. JOHN LITTLE
23) 60) text: What are ya, m'old cock? ROBIN
23) 61) text: Er... Robin... He pauses, checking the faces of the angry peasants.
23) 62) dialog: ...Hood.   Robin Hood.   Who are you?
23) 64) dialog: Bestman?   You lead this rabble? WILL SCARLET
23) 66) dialog: Tax?   For what? WILL SCARLET
23) 67) text: For passage through Sherwood. ROBIN
23) 72) text: A man who travels with two servants and claims he's without money, is either a fool or a liar. Grabbing Robin, Little shakes him like a doll. Something CLINKS. Robin's father's medallion. Laughing heartily, Little rips it from Robin's neck and tosses it to Scarlet WILL SCARLET
23) 73) text: And this one is a liar. (he bites the metal) Ahah! Gold! The men cheer.   John snatches the medallion back from Will. ROBIN
23) 75) text: Sacred to us too, mush. This here'll feed us for a bloomin' month. Robin draws his sword. ROBIN
23) 81) text: You must be Robin of Locksley. The blackguard who abandoned us to Nottingham's plundering.
23) 87) dialog: Aslan! Aslan shrugs. Robin swings a fist into the giant's gut. John doesn't flinch. Hoists Robin off the ground with one arm. Cannonballs the other fist into Robin's stomach. Robin folds. WILL SCARLET
23) 89) text: And for the laughs. The woodsmen find this hysterical. They disappear into the tree. Will administers one final kick before leaving. Robin staggers to his feet. Glares furiously at Aslan. ROBIN
23) 94) dialog: That rabble? ASLAN
23) 100) text: Defeat him and they will follow you. ROBIN
23) 102) text: I hear the voice of a spoiled child, Master Robin. I suggest you cease your brave talk of revenge and flee to the north. ROBIN
24) 0) text: A large tree trunk spans a swift-flowing river. The ragged band of woodsmen approach the makeshift bridge. Stop in their tracks. Robin stands on the bridge, brandishing a long wooden staff. ROBIN
24) 2) text: Just bugger off, mate, huh? ROBIN
24) 10) text: Alright, m'old cock. You wanna nuther good wallopin'? His confidence melting, Robin glances back at Duncan and Aslan, who grins like a fan at a boxing match. John storms at Robin. Staffs thrash. Driven back, Robin connects a blow on John's foot. The giant is off-balance. Robin follows up. Lands a couple to the ribs. John responds with heavy swings, which Robin blocks deftly. Back and forth, blow for blow, all blocked. John chuckles with every swing. Enjoying the time of his life. Their staffs lock. It's strength against strength. Robin is no match. With one mighty thrust, John hurtles him into the stream. The woodsmen cheer loudly. Aslan watches impassively. Robin scrambles back onto the bridge.   John waits, grinning. JOHN LITTLE
24) 12) text: Don't fool with him. Get him! John charges. Robin fends him off, gets in some shots of his own. John swings in a giant arc. Robin ducks. John loses balance and falls to his knees. Robin allows him time to right himself. John comes at him again, pummeling. Wood splinters from the impact. Brute force versus agility. Agility is beginning to prevail, when Robin's staff splits in two. JOHN LITTLE
24) 13) text: Swimmin' time again, ol' chum. The coup de grace. Lands heavily. Robin teeters. Falls. Disappears under the foaming water... does not re-emerge. John waits. The spectators rush to the bank. No sign.
24) 17) text: Bloomin' shame. 'E were a brave 'un. Suddenly Robin arcs up out of the water. His hands clamp onto John's ankles. Robin heaves with all his might. John topples headfirst into the water. Surfaces in panic.
24) 19) dialog: Do you yield? The terrified giant sputters. Goes under again, flailing with arms and legs. Robin holds his head just above the surface.
24) 20) dialog: Do you yield?
24) 22) dialog: Good.   Now put your feet down. John struggles, then his feet hit bottom... The water only reaches his chest. JOHN LITTLE
24) 23) text: I'll be buggered. ROBIN
24) 25) text: Robin Hood, ya got balls o' solid rock. He hands Robin back the medallion. Chuckling loudly, he swoops Robin up in his arms and carries him to the bank.
25) 0) text: A BONFIRE CRACKLES. The woodsmen drink, eat, argue, and fight. A rabble. John passes Robin a jug.
25) 5) dialog: (drinks)
25) 14) dialog: You owe me nothing, Wulf. I am glad I chanced by in time to help.
25) 16) dialog: Tell me about your men, John. John points to a short fellow with the build of a tree trunk.
25) 20) text: This stumpy one 'ere's David o' Doncaster. We calls 'im Bull. ROBIN
25) 22) text: 'Cuz o' my size, Sire. ROBIN

25) 27) text: That be Hal Brownwell, but the lads call i'm Hal Hiccup. The others make hiccup and belching sounds, and crack up at Hal's embarrassment. Hal strikes out angrily at his tormentors. ROBIN
25) 28) text: Hold! Hal, you have the face and hands of a farmer. I wager you are a strong and honest man, and I'd be glad to have you at my side in a fight. The next man who makes light of you will have to answer to me. There is murmuring around the group, but no one elects to try it. ROBIN
25) 33) text: We're outlaws. Got prices on our 'eads, every man jack. Blasted Sheriff says we owes 'im taxes. ROBIN
25) 35) text: We get by, I reckon. ROBIN

25) 43) text: Ha! I would never be led by the son of a Druid. ROBIN
25) 44) text: There are many here who knew my father to be a kind and generous man. I doubt that in their hearts they believe him capable of such a horror. Murmurs of agreement from around the fire.    Robin turns to Will.
25) 51) text: That there's Will Scarlet. Pay 'im no 'eed. 'E's full o' piss and wind. ROBIN
25) 54) dialog: We can win.   And I believe we will. LITTLE JOHN

28) 0) text: Robin taps his way through the crowd. Past the piercing stare of the armored GUARD at the gate.

29) 2) text: Grant him also the strength to bring to justice the lawless men who threaten its safety. Help him to stamp out the curse of the dread Druids who would seize from us our children, even as wolves steal the lambs from their mothers. The rear of the church. Standing crushed together, the poor and afflicted. Old and young. Starving children. Among them, Robin. The sermon ends. As the nobles file out, the poor are galvanized. Begging hands reach out.

29) 56) text: I am here with a blade at your throat. As long as I live, you will always know that I could be here again. A YELL from across the church. Gisborne has spotted them. Robin digs the knife a little deeper.
29) 60) dialog: Your answer?
29) 62) text: Then it will begin.. Gisborne yells orders.   Robin hurls Nottingham against the wall.
30) 0) text: Robin runs to the courtyard and leaps on the Sheriff's horse, which is held by a stunned groom. He rides through the busy marketplace. A crossbowman tracks him. A sure shot. Marian spots the danger. She fakes being tripped and stumbles into the bowman. His bolt flies harmlessly into the air. MARIAN
30) 1) text: (innocently) Please excuse my clumsiness. Robin charges for the city gate. As he passes, he kicks the guard who hasseled him into the wall.

35) 0) text: Hands tighten a girth. Will confidently jokes with his cronies. Woodsmen form a primitive circle of spectators. Little John and his wife, Fanny, keep to themselves, while Wulf openly talks with Robin, Aslan and Duncan. Robin is stripped to the waist, his muscled skin ravaged with scars. ASLAN
35) 3) text: Will is ruthless, Robin.    Guard your back. ROBIN
35) 4) text: I am grateful for your concern, friends, but I have to prove to them it is possible to overcome unequal odds. (shouts) I am ready, Will. Will bends, as if checking the horse's legs. Secretly grabs a handful of sand. Swings into the saddle and digs in his heels. Closing in, Will flings the sand in Robin's eyes. Robin clutches his hands to his face, blinded. Will spins back to the attack. His sword slashes. Reacting to the sound, Robin rolls aside. The men cheer like a big fight crowd. Robin's POV is blurred. Ducking the blade, he grabs Will's arm. A blow glances off his shoulder. Robin falls to his knees, still blinded. Will rides right at him, to trample him. Robin scrambles away. Will wheels his horse. A flashing hoof grazes Robin's chest. Robin leaps to his feet and yells at the top of his lungs. Panicked, the HORSE rears, WHINNYING wildly. Will struggles to stay in the saddle. Loses his sword. Robin seizes the moment and runs to a water trough. Douses his face. Yells at Will.
35) 8) text: Come on, you little piss pot. Do your worst! Will grabs a spear from a bystander. Robin stands his ground. Will lunges, Robin sidesteps. ROBIN
35) 9) text: The horse is smarter than you are, Will. Some of the men laugh. Will is incensed. Robin ducks and weaves, easily evading Will's repeated charges. Robin ducks right under the horse's belly.
35) 10) dialog: Here, Will!   You aim like a girl, Will! Will stabs wildly, more and more frustrated. Laughter spreads, as Robin plays hide and seek around the horse's legs. Grabbing the end of the spear, he clowns a tug of war. Enraged, Will strains and tries to kick Robin away. Suddenly, Robin lets go. Unbalanced, Will flies back- wards off his mount. Robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen adversary. The crowd falls silent. Robin strikes. The point quivers in the ground below Will's crotch. Will wriggles in terror. Impaled, his pants rip open. ROBIN
35) 11) text: Thank the Lord you are not endowed like Bull. The crowd is convulsed with laughter. Robin catches his breath. Does not see Will, who grabs a heavy staff and runs at him. A strong hand grasps Will's arm as he is about to strike. LITTLE JOHN

36) 2) dialog: How many?
36) 4) dialog: Twenty?   They usually have five. He grabs the telescope.
36) 7) dialog: This is no ordinary convoy. Bull calls up from below, where a ragged group of woods- men lies nervously in ambush.
36) 14) dialog: Let's go. Together they run down the hill, keeping low. Gisborne eyes the forest. The beer cart is steered by a fat red-faced FRIAR, raucously singing hymns and quaffing from a jug, which he repeatedly dips into one of the barrels. ARROWS WHISTLE in. The Friar yells and drops his jug. A soldier is hit. At the forest edge, four woodsmen reload their longbows. Dressed in green, their faces camouflaged. The mounted soldiers charge them. The  woodsmen run into the trees. As the horsemen close in,  the runners leap into a trench. Lift up matted screens  of brush and grass. It's as if they disappeared.   The soldiers slash wildly at the thick screens. More arrows fly. More soldiers fall. The others spin in confusion, trying to discern the enemy. More woods- men break from cover. Run down a narrow path. Gisborne urges his men to pursue. They ride in single file, beating their way through the tangled branches. The runners dive into the trees, as other men haul on ropes, raising a giant screen in the soldiers' path. The horses swerve, on the edge of a twenty-foot drop to the river gorge. Momentum  carries many of them over the cliff.

37) 23) text: ... you must best me for it. Robin staggers. The Friar whips up the horse. Dazed, Robin grabs for the fat man's leg. Gets a holy sandal full in the face.
37) 26) text: Protect me, Lord. He sweeps his foot, knocking Robin's legs out from under him. Hurls his full body weight on top of him. Whooomf!

The Captain tries to back away. Robin    tries to restrain Aslan, is hurled aside. Snarling,    drooling at the mout Aslan explores the Captain's body   with his hands. A butcher checking meat. ROBIN

43) 2) text: Take a gander at this 'un, mates. Never seen nuthin' like it in my bloomin' life. Robin leads Marian through the camp... the beginnings of a village -- women doing laundry, kids playing, men prac- ticing archery and swordplay, others working on defenses, camouflaging a giant pit. Marian is impressed, but not about to admit it. MARIAN
43) 3) text: This better be damned important. Robin leads her into a hut. Inside is a trove of cap- tured loot -- purses, jewelry, weaponry, fancy coats and... the treasure chest. At Robin's nod, Bull throws back the lid. Marian is speechless. ROBIN
43) 9) dialog: Somebody has to take a stand.
43) 12) dialog: Nottingham was sending this gold to buy reinforcements from the Celtic tribesmen. We need to warn King Richard.

47) 28) dialog: The knife?
47) 32) dialog: Now you tell me! Wulf runs back in.     Aslan holds up a piece of wood.

52) 3) text: Come, holy man. A toast to all of Allah's children. The true believers and the fat infidels. Tuck laughs and drinks. Aslan sways and topples at the Friar's feet. Heaves up all over the holy sandals. Tuck looks at Robin.

57) 10) text: Because you love me. Say it. You love me. (as Robin struggles) Say it! ROBIN
57) 12) text: Kiss me. He gives himself to her. Their lips meet... something changes in his vision. Her eyes glow red. Her face starts to shrivel -- He is kissing the wrinkled lips of Mortianna. He pulls away... strong arms grab him. He shakes his head, trying to make sense. Through his BLURRED vision, we see he is surrounded by masked men. ROBIN
57) 14) text: She is with friends. (cackles) Your resistence is strong, but useless. Sign this. (as quill is forced into his hand) You are a Druid like your father. You consort with the devil. Your confession will be witnessed by the Bishop of Hereford. A guard forces Robin's hand across the page... then cries out, clutching his back... An arrow lodged be- tween his shoulders. In the cave mouth are Wulf, bow in hand, Bull kneeling beside Sarah's corpse, and Aslan. MORTIANNA

58) 5) text: It worked for me this very morning. (as Robin heaves) You will thank me for this later.
59) 0) text: Distant THUNDER. Three horses. First Wulf's, leading another with the bodies of Bull and Sarah draped across its back. Aslan rides the third, with Robin propped up in front of him. ROBIN

64) 3) text: I saved your life. I will not let you give it away for no purpose. ROBIN
65) 8) text: Git the bleedin' 'ell outa there, ya li'l bugger. Distracted, he doesn't see a Celt swing at his back... but Wulf's arrow pierces the man's adam's apple. He freezes in mid-air, before toppling at John's feet. When John turns back, Wulf is being dragged away by three of the Sherrif's men. He attempts to pursue, but is intercepted by two more Celts... and struck down. Aslan charges between the two Celts. Slashes down with both swords. Both men topple to the ground simultaneously. Suddenly all is quiet.    The smoking clearing is a mass of fallen bodies. Only    four men seem to be alive. Robin, Aslan, Tuck, who   is slouched against a tree gasping for breath, and   Hal, who kneels clutching his wounded shoulder. Robin dismounts and runs to Little John. Overwhelmed and exhausted, he slumps over the giant's unmoving form. LITTLE JOHN

John drinks and pass the jug to Tuck, who numbly   shakes his head. Too depressed even to drink. Aslan folds his prayer rug and walks over to Robin, who sits alone, staring vacantly into the darkness. ROBIN
68) 2) text: No, friend. It was you who gave these men pride. ROBIN
68) 6) text: That is for me to decide. ROBIN
68) 7) text: (raging) Damn you, Arab. I want you out of my life. Can't you understand that? Go home. Go back to your own kind. Aslan stares at him, then turns away. Not the time for argument. Robin fingers his father's medallion... rips it from his neck.
68) 16) text: Kiss me, Robin. The noose tightens on her neck. As she dies, her face shrivels into the cackling features of Mortianna. Next, Robin's father.   He stares accusingly right AT us. LOCKSLEY
68) 17) text: Why have you betrayed me?   Why? Before he pulls the rope, the executioner peels back his hood... It is Robin. Gloating, he hauls on the rope. His laughter blends with that of Mortianna in a hideous cacophony.

71) 10) text: We have no armored knights, no glorious banners. But I am honored to be going to battle in this company. Today we fight not just for the lives of our friends, but to save all England. A moment of tension before Will takes the proferred hand. ROBIN

85) 0) text: The scaffold is impregnable. Celts and their Chieftain guard the platform itself. The Sherriff's men surround the base. The executioner encircles Wulf's neck with the noose. SPARKS! Tuck ignites a fuse-cord leading to one of the barrels. A hand tightens the noose... Another grasps an arrow. The executioner's eyes glint through the slits. Nottingham intently watches Wulf. The Chieftain stands, impassive. Fingers close on a bowstring... the fuse-cord burns. Wulf steps to the trap, ready to plunge.   His eyes close An arrow flies... slices through the executioner's eye slit. The executioner falls. Little John celebrates... but the Chieftain leaps forward... releases the trap. Wulf's body plunges.   The rope snaps tight. Little John yells.   Fanny screams. A figure leaps onto the platform... the wounded soldier throws aside his crutch... Robin! Wulf dangles, strangling.   His hands wrench at the choking cord.

85) 24) text: It's over, fool. You can kill my body, but you cannot kill our spirit. He finally drops... Nottingham heads for the castle. Robin attempts to follow. He swings from the noose, using the rope to vault over the surrounding soldiers. As he lands, he is waylaid by one of the barons and his men.
85) 28) text: Englishmen! I am not one of you, yet I fight for you. Against a tyrant. Join me now. Join Robin Hood. The onlookers are inspired. Grabbing weapons from fallen soldiers, many join the fray.
85) 33) text: Too slow, fool! He hacks at the ropes. The gate slices down like a guillotine, pinning soldiers and peasants alike. Fighting his way towards the gate, Robin sees   with dism that the portcullis is closed. Weakening, he    staves of the redhead baron's vicious assault. Suddenly    peasants are swarming over his attacker. The baron is    dragged o and trampled down.

In seconds, all three are down and Robin is off and running. Down corridors, searching. Soldiers and armed servants converge to block his way. Robin strikes, vaults, flings statues. Up the stairs... topples a suit of armor down on his pursuers. ROBIN

96) 1) text: ...your bodies to be bound in immortal wedlock. Do you, Marian Dubois, take... The chapel DOORS SHATTER inward. Robin backs in, bloodied, fencing with four remaining soldiers. He smashes one by swinging the heavy door into him, hurtles a pew at another. He springs off another pew, taking down a third.
96) 2) dialog: Marian, run!   It's me, Robin. Run! Marian remains immobile. Mortianna moves to her side. Robin is struck in the thigh. Like a vulture, the Sheriff waits. Tiring, blood pouring from his leg, Robin prepares to fight him.
96) 7) text: No companions? No army? You rush to your death for the sake of a woman. Lust has turned you into a fool... Recognize this, Locksley? He raises his sword to reveal its handle. A crucifix sculpted into the hilt... Robin's father's sword. NOTTINGHAM
96) 8) text: Appropriate I should use it to kill you with, don't you think? He lunges. A savage, accomplished swordsman, with fire in his eyes. Exhausted, Robin is driven back, parrying desperately.
