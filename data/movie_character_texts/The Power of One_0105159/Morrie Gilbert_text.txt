14) 7) text: Next week we have Mr. Levy who will enlighten us on... MORRIE, a bright-eyed kinetic, speaks up. MORRIE
15) 0) text: Morrie waits in the now nearly-empty hall, taking some money from another boy and making notations in a black book. PK comes up to him.
15) 5) dialog: A snap. PK
15) 6) text: For a brain like you, maybe. MORRIE
15) 8) text: But will they pay for the privilege? MORRIE
15) 10) text: Morrie Levy. Is that the voice of sentimentality I hear coming from you? MORRIE
16) 1) dialog: You hear Sutcliffe screwed Bartlett's sister when he stayed with them over holidays?
16) 3) dialog: I heard it from Bartlett's own lips. He's selling reservations for next holiday. A pound for one night; three pounds for four.
16) 5) dialog: For both of us. Took the whole holiday. The CHEERING crowd grows LOUDER the closer they get to the double doors.
16) 6) dialog: You nervous?
16) 8) dialog: Christ! I'm about to have a calf. This bloody Boer gets lucky, we're in the poorhouse. They reach the double doors. Still in CLOSEUP, Morrie turns to face PK for the first time.
16) 9) dialog: Now remember. We're not here to exhibit our wares. We go in, we do the job, we get out. Right? PK is so focused his eyes seem to bore through the doors. He does not move his head a hair.
16) 21) dialog: We're in a bloody war here, in
16) 26) dialog: Get up!     Get up! But PK is seeing double.    He shakes his head, trying to clear it.
16) 27) dialog: Up!   Up!
16) 32) dialog: What are you trying to do, bankrupt us? What happened? PK turns and looks at the two Africans at the rear door. Morrie's eyes follow him, tensing as he sees the two men.
16) 33) dialog: Christ! If they get caught in here they're dead. (beat)
16) 36) dialog: Well, worry about it later. In case you haven't noticed, this Boer bastard is trying to kill you.
16) 38) dialog: Yeah? The BELL RINGS. PK and   Morrie trade a look. Jannie comes rushing over and  throws a big right. PK steps to his own right side and  pops Jannie right over his droppe left hand. He looks at   Morrie again.
16) 40) dialog: 
16) 41) dialog: Thank you, God. Jannie comes after PK, paying for each big right he throws as PK finds his mark. PK plants one, then two, then three punches on Jannie's face. Finally, frus- trated, Jannie forsakes all pretense of boxing and tries to nail PK with wild, flailing blows. PK bobs and weaves and feints. Jannie's punches grow weary. PK begins to bear down, driving his man back with rapid-fire com- binations until he delivers the coup de grace, a left hook to the heart and a driving right uppercut. Jannie goes down in a heap. The crowd goes wild. The Referee counts him out. Jannie's seconds rush into the ring to lift their fallen fighter. Morrie also rushes in, followed by the Prince of Wales boxing team. They hoist PK up on their shoulders.
17) 0) text: The boxing team and a number of their supporters are in raucous celebration. Morrie comes bouncing through the crowd, until he enters the empty dressing room in the rear, where PK is getting dressed. Morrie takes a wad of money out of his pocket.
17) 1) dialog: Here you go, pal. He hands PK the money.
17) 3) dialog: 
17) 5) text: Thanks for the advice.    The information please. MORRIE
17) 9) text: What's her name and where do I find her? Morrie sighs. MORRIE
17) 12) dialog: Already have.    Three-to-one says you don't. PK
17) 13) text: Where'd you bet? MORRIE
17) 16) dialog: In case you have to bail yourself out. PK boxes him around playfully and skips out, running the gauntlet of the celebration outside.
35) 0) text: Morrie lies in bed, asleep.   PK sits up at his desk, writing.
36) 0) text: The seedy side of town. PK carrying a gym bag and Morrie looking a bit out of place in their school blazers come striding up the alley.
36) 2) dialog: Look, even if the scholarship doesn't come through, my old man said he'd lend you the money.
36) 4) dialog: All right. All right. We'll call it the 'Levy Carpet Emporium Scholarship for Poor but Proud Christian Gentlemen.' How's that?
36) 6) dialog: God, I hate people who can't be bought.
36) 8) dialog: I don't know.    Personality disorder. PK nods in agreement.
37) 0) text: Morrie and PK rush up the stairs, stop at the landing, and collect themselves before opening the door to the gym. They take a breath and enter.
38) 5) text: And he's the best.    C'mon. PK leads Morrie across the gym. PK passes an African fighter. He stops training when he sees PK. He turns to another African fighter, glancing at PK. One by one the blacks in the gym stop training to look at PK. PK and Morrie approach the rheumy Old Man yelling at the two fighters in the ring above him in a thick Polish- Jewish accent. SOLLY (OLD MAN)
38) 13) text: And who are you? MORRIE
38) 15) text: Oy gevalt. (beat) You know you train here it's not like those nice school fights you're used to. Three knockdowns you win. Just then, as if to underscore his point, one of the fighters in the ring gets caught witha solid shot to the jaw. He hits the canvas inches from where they are standing. Solly, PK and Morrie all look at him, and then at each other. MORRIE
38) 18) text: ... less. Morrie pulls out a wad of money and proffers it to Solly. MORRIE
38) 26) text: Thank you, sir. PK heads towards the rear.      Solly turns to Morrie. SOLLY
38) 27) text: Why's he want to do this, a nice- looking schoolboy? MORRIE
38) 29) text: Oh sure, sure. And I'd like to be twenty-five again. MORRIE
38) 32) dialog: You name them. Solly gives him a long look. SOLLY
39) 0) text: PK is in the ring getting ready to spar with a well-built opponent. Morrie stands at ringside with Solly.
46) 0) text: PK in the ring is about to start sparring.    Solly gives him instruction as Morrie stands by.
46) 7) dialog: How do you get away with this, Mr. G? Why don't they close you down? I mean, there are laws about blacks and white boxing each other.
47) 0) text: PK pounds the heavy bag as Morrie stands by.
47) 1) dialog: Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That's it. PK stops, relaxing. Morrie throws a towel over his shoulders. One of Solly's ASSISTANTS comes over.
48) 0) text: Solly faces the door as it opens.    PK and Morrie enter.
48) 1) dialog: You wanted to see us, Mr. G.?
48) 4) dialog: With who?
48) 6) dialog: A black fighter! They want him to fight a black fighter?
48) 8) dialog: Out of the question. Not even up for discussion. C'mon, P.K.
48) 13) text: In thirty years I know him, number one on the list. MORRIE
48) 19) dialog: I mean besides    getting thrown out of school and    into jail, do you know what else    happens you do this? He's a     pro. The minute you fight him    you're a pro. SOLLY
48) 20) text: There's no purse being offered. MORRIE
48) 22) text: Tell Mr. Nguni I'll think about it. PK exits with Morrie steaming behind. They head for the locker room, PK clearly perturbed.
48) 24) dialog: Okay.    What's going on?
48) 28) dialog: For you? PK
48) 29) text: I haven't heard it in years. PK begins to disrobe. MORRIE
48) 31) text: I told you about bringing tobacco to the prisoners at Barberton? Well after that was going for a while I learned that even though they could send and receive letters, they never did. They couldn't read or write. MORRIE
48) 37) dialog: I can see where 'angel' would be an appropriate title. (beat)
48) 40) dialog: Man like that should be running a country, not rotting in prison.
49) 0) text: PK and Morrie exit the locker room.
49) 6) dialog: Beats talking about the weather. You may have heard about me?
49) 16) dialog: Do I look that daft?
49) 18) dialog: He means the bank. Your boyfriend has a great head for literature but none for finance. They exit the staircase.
49) 35) text: What's this here? Maria is gripped by fear.     Morrie is cautious, unmovin PK
49) 40) text: And you? MORRIE
63) 0) text: Solly starts the engine as PK and Morrie hop in.
66) 3) dialog: You deserted?
67) 4) dialog: Where are the men?
68) 1) dialog: I don't see why we have to weigh in. They're going to fight anyway.
70) 3) text: Onoshobishopi Ingelosi. Shobi shobi Ingelosi. PK looks back at Maria who is a bit unnerved, as are Morrie and Solly. He looks across at Mandoma whose face is a mask looking straight ahead, betraying nothing. The two men climb into the ring and stand in their corners. The Old Woman shuffles over and peers into PK's face. She mutters something inaudible, then turns to the crowd. OLD WOMAN
70) 10) text: Continue. Again, Mandoma comes charging hard. PK defends himself as best he can, trying to counter. But Mandoma's offense won't allow it. He beats on PK until the round ends. PK sits down in his corner. Morrie works on his eye. PK
70) 18) dialog: Look -- he's taking water.
70) 44) dialog: We're in the shit now.      Nice knowing you, Solly.
71) 0) text: PK stands with Maria by the tree they use to climb over the wall. In the b.g. Solly and Morrie wait in the car.
73) 0) text: Morrie is sleeping in the back seat.         Solly and PK sitting in the front.
74) 0) text: As PK and Morrie jog toward their dorm a VOICE stops them from behind.
74) 3) dialog: You're up early, sir.
74) 6) dialog: Have to put in the roadwork, sir. You know, keep those legs strong. St. John eyes the bruise on PK's cheek.
75) 0) text: PK and Morrie open the door and stop cold. Gideon Mandoma sits in a chair facing the door. He rises.
75) 9) text: To be part of something you must know what everyone else knows. We have our own knowledge. We need yours. MORRIE
75) 11) text: Then it must be the same with us. MORRIE
82) 0) text: PK and Morrie stick close in the shadows. PK looks at his watch and then twenty feet away to the locked gate.
82) 1) dialog: Christ! If someone would have told me this is where I'd be on a Saturday night, last term of my senior year, I'd call them batty. (beat)
82) 4) dialog: You get the insider friend's rate.
82) 11) dialog: Let's get inside before the whole bloody world sees us.
83) 0) text: The Africans are seated around desks, waiting for Morrie and PK to tell them what to do.
83) 3) text: ... is Morrie. Now you all have a chalkboard. He holds up the chalkboard.
83) 13) text: We're doing alphabet, from the letter 'A.' PK takes up his position with Morrie, ready to check the chalkboards. Maria takes the front of the class.
84) 0) text: The Africans are exiting. Maria, Morrie and PK stand, receiving their heartfelt thanks one by one. Mandoma is the last to leave.
84) 6) dialog: Well, I   think I'll go... um... lay on   my back and count the cracks   in the ceiling. 'Night. Nice to   see you, Maria.
85) 2) text: We made it!   We made it! He thrusts one of the letters at PK. MORRIE
85) 3) text: Sorry. I couldn't bear the suspense after I read mine.   I had to open it. PK looks at his letter. MORRIE
85) 5) text: You're out of here. MORRIE
85) 6) text: What the hell are you talking about? He snatches PK's letter. MORRIE
85) 8) text: It says nothing about the scholarship. MORRIE
85) 10) text: St. John wants to see you two in his study. MORRIE
86) 0) text: PK and Morrie enter to a somber St. John.
86) 7) dialog: We're only teaching them how to read and do sums.
86) 19) text: I'm just doing my job. And if you'll take some advice, you should just do yours. Bretyn exits. MORRIE
86) 29) text: I heard you were accepted at Oxford. MORRIE
86) 31) text: Well, congratulations. MORRIE
89) 0) text: Morrie is asleep.   PK wakes him.
89) 2) dialog: What?
89) 5) dialog: What time is it? He looks at his watch and turns over.
89) 6) dialog: Can I see it later?
89) 8) dialog: You know, when we get to Oxford -- separate rooms.
89) 10) dialog: Is there some girl out there waiting for me?
89) 12) dialog: Bullshit. PK throws a jersey into his chest and pulls him out of the room.
90) 0) text: The campus is swaddled in early morning fog. PK and Morrie stand on the side of the school chapel while a black groundsman opens the door to the basement.
90) 2) dialog: I think you're fooling yourself into thinking the bastards won't
91) 2) dialog: Yes. But I'm not the one who has to respect it.
91) 4) dialog: I'm sure he does, but I'd still like to see a big bolt on the inside door.
96) 0) text: PK and Morrie    stand by a side gate near the athletic field looking    alertly about. The gate  opens. The Africans led    by Mandoma come through.  PK and Morrie greet them.     When they are all through Morrie closes the gate and    runs after them.
98) 28) dialog: by the door, slowly slipping the bolt lock, trying to remain innocuous while doing so. PK sees him and trades a look with Mandoma, who also sees what Morrie is doing.
98) 31) dialog: Now! He goes to charge out the door, but to his chagrin the door does not open, locked from the outside.
100) 0) text: Thousands of Africans and a smattering of whites have gathered outside the cemetery. The singing rises from them. Gideon, Morrie, St. John and Solly stand in front of the crowd.
102) 0) text: PK sits at his desk filling out application forms. Morrie enters.   He picks one up off the desk and looks at it.
102) 1) dialog: 
102) 5) dialog: Why are you so bloody stubborn? You don't belong in a South African university any more than I belong in the priesthood. Will you take my father's loan? PK takes the applications back just as a TELEGRAPH DELIVERY BOY comes to the door.
102) 7) dialog: It's your scholarship. Morrie grabs the telegram.
102) 9) dialog: What's your name?
102) 11) dialog: You're not one to talk about names. Morrie scribbles his signature and proceeds to open the telegram. PK snatches it away from him. He pulls the telegram out. His face falls to worry.
102) 12) dialog: What's it say?
112) 6) dialog: They don't want you here any more than they want me.
112) 9) dialog: Take the hint. Screw the scholarship. Come on. Let's leave.
112) 12) dialog: Where are you going?
112) 14) text: PK exits the room. Morrie chases after him.
112) 15) dialog: P.K., goddammit!
