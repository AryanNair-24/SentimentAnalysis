24) 1) dialog: Ja. Perfect.    You will excuse me, please. DOC, speaking in German-accented English, moves off from the sun's glare down to PK's level. On his back is a knapsack with a cactus sticking out of it.
24) 2) dialog: This I do not normally without permission do, ja? But to catch the expression. After all, it is the expression that is important. Ja? Without the expression the human being is just a lump of meat. You have some problems, I think. I am Professor Karl von Vollensteen. Doc clicks his heels together and bows his head slightly.

24) 7) text: So began my education. Doc and PK walk the veldt across craggy mountain trails, down dry river beds, through the jungle, always collectin cacti and aloe samples, Doc always talking, always explaining.
24) 9) dialog: The brain, P.K., has two functions. It is the best reference library ever, which is a good thing to have. Ja? But also from it comes original thought. In school you will get all filled up with the facts. Here your brain will learn where to look, how to look, how to think. And then you will have for yourself all the brains that have ever been. Doc and PK sit high up. PK watches the endless animal migration below while Doc points things out across the landscape.

26) 4) dialog: If God would choose a plant to represent Him, I think He would choose of all plants the cactus. This one plant has all the blessings He tried but failed to give man. It is true. Look. The cactus is humble but not submissive. It grows where no other plant will grow. The sun bakes its back, the wind rips it from cliffs, or drowns it in the dry desert sand. Not a complaint. In good times or bad it will still flower. It protects itself from danger. Doc touches a cactus needle.
26) 5) dialog: But it harms no other plant.   It

29) 0) text: Doc and PK wander through the jungle looking for flora.
29) 1) dialog: Everything fits, P.K. Nothing is unexplained. Nature is one big chain reaction. Everything depends on everything else. From the smallest to the biggest. Always in life an idea starts small like a tree. Doc shows PK a small tree with an even smaller vine attached to it.
29) 2) dialog: This tree can grow so high it can touch the face of the sky. But this little vine can choke it and keep it small. Most people are like these vines. Afraid of new ideas. Afraid to let things grow. Doc rips the vine away from the tree.
29) 3) dialog: Always listen to yourself. Follow your own idea. If you are wrong, so what? You learn something. And with learning you grow stronger. And if you are right at the beginning? An even bigger bonus.

33) 2) dialog: P.K., if there is one thing I know you to be that is a lot more than just satisfactory. Ja?
33) 4) dialog: Why not?
33) 6) dialog: My boy, to be smart is not a sin. But to be smart and not use it, that is sin number one. And as for getting beat up on, use your brain to figure out how not to be. He hands PK the report card, his displeasure obvious. As they crest the hill the cottage comes INTO VIEW along with a parked Army car and two armed soldiers leaning against it. Seeing Doc and PK, the soldiers smarten up, raising their rifles and advancing. Doc's face grows pale, his lips tight.   PK pulls close t him for support.
33) 7) dialog: Again it begins. The stupidity. Do not be frightened. Doc puts na arm around PK's shoulder, drawing him close, comforting him. One of the soldiers pulls a pair of handcuffs out of his pocket as he advances.

54) 13) dialog: Geel Piet, when a painter finishes a work of art he doesn't lose it. He sends it out in the world so everyone can see the genius of his creation. This is what you are going to do. And to celebrate the launch of such a work of art as you have made our boxer here, I have composed an entire concerto -- 'The Concerto for the Southland' -- which it is my intention to play in concert for the prisoners before I leave.
54) 15) dialog: He'll think it's a concert for him and the brass. But we'll know, ay? And the people will know.

78) 5) text: Why you don't use it. It's only a little pill under the tongue. DOC
78) 7) text: Well, until you become something else, the little pills would make this easier on your heart. A CLAP of THUNDER cuts into their conversation.   Thick roiling rain clouds appear suddenly. DOC
78) 8) text: Little pills or no little pills -- we don't find cover, we both turn into something else. Lightning splits the sky.   Rain begins to fall, pelting the escarpment. DOC
78) 9) text: Look for a cave. Always in this kind of rock there is caves. Quick! Quick! PK starts to move horizontally across the cliff face like a spider on a wall. Doc follows. The rain becomes torrential. PK turns to look back at Doc. DOC

79) 8) dialog: Here.   See?   There is a passage. Before PK can say anything else, Doc has wriggled through the small opening. PK, a bit peeved, takes his own flashlight and follows.
80) 0) text: PK crawls after Doc, making his way through the small tunnel on his stomach.
80) 1) dialog: You know the pyramids are nothing more than man's attempt to recreate the first safe home our species had -- the cave. It is the ultimate safe resting place. The first place man could lay down and have a good night's sleep without worrying about waking up as something's supper. Doc stops crawling.   So does PK.   A DRIPPING can be heard.
80) 2) dialog: You hear that? There is something waiting for us. Doc starts moving quicker.
80) 4) dialog: Better, ja?
80) 11) dialog: Who can think about rain when you are on the edge of the great unknown cave.

106) 4) dialog: So Mr. Schmartypants. It did not take you so long to figure out what happened. I hope you forgive me for not saying goodbye, but I did not think it would be necessary between us. What could I say you don't already know.
106) 6) dialog: That I love you with all my heart? That you have given me more in our ten years of friendship than three lifetimes could fill? That the last thoughts I have before becoming something else will be of music, cactus, and you? You know all this. PK turns the sheet to page two which is a whole side of music.
106) 7) dialog: Last night this music came into my head. It is my music for Africa. My music for you. So go. Be welterweight champion of the world. Be a writer. A great writer. Remember -- the only thing between a dream and a reality is you. Until we meet again, your friend, Doc. PK looks down at Doc as a PIANO CONCERTO, beautiful, haunting, BEGINS TO PLAY.
107) 0) text: PK plays the music Doc wrote with only the moonlight illuminating the page. The music is soul-stirring, rich, evocative. Tears run down PK's cheeks. PAN FROM PK THROUGH the CACTUS GARDEN to the FULL MOON illuminating the African veldt as the MUSIC dominates and then FADES into the night.
