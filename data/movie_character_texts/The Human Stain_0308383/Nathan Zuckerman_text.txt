I got her to the hospital, but it was too late. (fixing Nathan with a look) The point is they meant to kill me, and they got her instead; all in the name of political correctness~-an oxymoron if I ever heard one. (pleased with himself) There's your book, Zuckerman.
9) 21) dialog: Look, Dean -
9) 23) dialog: Look...ah, Coleman, I can see you're devastated. And I'm sorry, really sorry. But I write fiction--
9) 26) dialog: If you don't mind a suggestion, maybe you ought to write this book yourself. Coleman considers this.

And this is obviously a rally ata women's clinic, because she is yelling at someone 0.S.. S looks both alive and vital, beautiful and plain, angry an thoroughly happy all at the same time.

The gin rummy game continues; both whooping with hilarity as they slam down their cards. Nat steals a look at the ping-pong table - it is now COVERED documents, boxes, more files. Nathan glances back and sees Coleman has caught his look.

13) 1) dialog: What's with the book?
13) 3) dialog: Meaning? (he nudges a box with a toe) Meaning it's worthless. You can't make a college without breaking egg-heads and I couldn't write a book called Spooks that didn't sound like a lunatic raving. All this... {nodding towards the cartons of papers) Useless; unless you count the dubious thrill of re-reading old love letters. He takes several letters that he has obviously just been reading and drops them on top of one of the boxes. TIGHTER IN as a photograph falls out of one of the envelo ON NATHAN--as he leans down and picks it up. HIS POV: INSERT OF THE PHOTOGRAPH--It is a snapshot taken the late forties by a street photographer. It shows the y Coleman Silk; his dark hair is closely cropped (in what u to be called a GI cut); he wears a tweed jacket, oxford cloth, button down shirt (not dissimilar to the one he is wearing now), crew necked sweater. He is walking down the street, with a stunningly beautiful blonde girl, their ar around one another, laughing. However, what we notice mos that the girl looks at him with total adoration. ON NATHAN--looking from the photograph to Coleman.

13) 8) dialog: That's not what I meant. Who's the girl?
13) 10) dialog: (with a look) Forgive me, Coleman, but you don't seem to me to be the Minnesota type.
13) 13) dialog: (taken aback) What?
13) 16) dialog: Alright, but just don't sing in my ear, okay? 17.
