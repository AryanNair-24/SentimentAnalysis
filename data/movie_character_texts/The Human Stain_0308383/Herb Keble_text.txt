91) 5) dialog: (continuing) "Coleman, I can't be with you on this." That is what I said, to my everlasting shame. Oh, I had my reasons. I thought I could help better behind the scenes. If I allied myself publicly, I told myself, I risked being labeled an Uncle Tom and thereby useless. I was wrong! I should never have said to my friend, "I can't be with you on this." I should have said, "I MUST be with you on this." I should have spoken up to say what I want to say now in the presence of his former colleagues and especially in the presence of his children: that the alleged misconduct never took place. Coleman Silk and his wife Iris were betrayed by the moral stupidity of a censorious, coercive community and I was a member of that community. We all were. Nathan looks around. People are crying.
