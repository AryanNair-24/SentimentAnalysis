I'm in love with you Sam, I always have been and it breaks my heart to see you waste your affections on Gary King.
43) 29) dialog: And since I'm being honest, just to lay it out, I am currently seeing a fitness instructor but I - she's 26- years-old - but I would drop her in a heartbeat, if I thought I had one last chance with you.

59) 13) dialog: They must have had his DNA on file. That’s how they were able to replicate him. They know how to get to us. Jesus, they know everything.

59) 19) dialog: Basil.

64) 11) dialog: Trying to help yourself more like!
64) 17) dialog: Yeah ‘for a change’.
64) 26) dialog: Wait, how do we know you put her in her car? How do we know you're you.
64) 36) dialog: Because of what Basil said. They make a copy from your DNA. That's why he had his birthmark. He was new, like a baby.
64) 39) dialog: Oliver with none of the shit that had happened to the real Oliver.
64) 44) dialog: So?
64) 54) dialog: What about you? Gary proudly reveals his ‘Sisters of Mercy’ tattoo.

66) 6) dialog: We're trapped. Where's The Beast? Andy whips out the TOURIST MAP from Gary's pocket.
66) 8) dialog: How the hell do we get to it?
66) 10) dialog: Through where? Andy looks up at the nearest building and shakes his head
66) 13) dialog: We need the keys. Andy and Steve look back to Gary. Their jaws drop. Gary is awake again and standing behind the bar, pulling himself a pint. Despite a black eye, his mood seems calm. (CONTINUED)
