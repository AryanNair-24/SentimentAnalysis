6) 25) dialog: Don’t tell me, you have to check with the missus?
6) 29) text: Andy stands up. Points to the door. Gary nods,
6) 30) dialog: What are you doing?
6) 32) dialog: Is that a door? It doesn't have a lintel. And it's glass. So is ita window or is it a door? I guess it's a windoor. You can have that.
6) 34) dialog: Six hundred wasn't it? Oh, by the way...
6) 36) dialog: Thought you should know. Mum died.
6) 38) dialog: Few weeks ago. The Big... Cancer.

8) 13) dialog: What do you mean?
8) 15) dialog: This is the car you sold me in 1989. Best 300 quid I ever spent.
8) 17) dialog: Pretty much. She's had a bit of work done. New suspension, brakes, exhaust, seats, wheels, panelling, carburettor, manifold - well, the whole engine really - other than that, it's the same old motor.
8) 19) dialog: Then what say we get this antique on the roadshow? The clock chimes four times. Gary beams, oblivious.

9) 8) dialog: Well, a lot of people are saying that about the Bible now.
9) 10) dialog: Don’t be daft, it was written by Jesus. Anyway, five sounds better. They missed a trick only having three. Two of them could’ve died and you'd still have three left.
10) 0) text: The Beast roars along the M-Whatever. 'I'm Free' by The S Dragons blasts from the stereo. Gary sings along.
10) 2) dialog: Yeah. This is it. (CONTINUED)

10) 8) dialog: Anyone hungry? They pass the safest point to exit for 'SERVICES',
10) 9) dialog: I need a piss actually. 23. but then- SCREECH. Gary swerves off the motorway at a hairy speed.
12) 4) dialog: I borrowed it from Peter to pay you. I still owe Paul. Andy glares at Gary. He is oblivious to their scorn.
13) 1) dialog: Oh shit. Newton Haven. We see a nondescript sprawl in the valley below.
13) 2) dialog: Take a moment to look upon it in its original colours boys, for tonight we paint it red. The Beast roars past a MOTORCYCLE COP. Immediately- POLIC SIRENS WHOOP. The Motorcycle Cop pulls them over.
13) 3) dialog: Fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck-fuck. Gary pats his pockets madly. The others look horrified.
13) 4) dialog: Oh no, wait, it's alright. I did it all at the services. KNOCK KNOCK. The Motorcycle Cop taps on the driver's wind Gary winds it down and turns off the stereo.
13) 6) dialog: Music too loud?
13) 8) dialog: Argh. The old brake lights! So called because they break all the time. I’1l get it sorted officer.
13) 12) dialog: Yes. No. Wait. It’s in my wallet. And I left that in the bloody gym!
13) 14) dialog: No, it’s all in my sports bag. Typical. I’1l happily give you my name and address if you need to run me through the old system.
13) 16) dialog: It’s Peter Page. And it’s 48 Bishop’s Gardens, London, N2 112. The Cop returns to his bike. The others furiously whisper
13) 19) dialog: I’m not giving him my name am I?
13) 21) dialog: You won’t get done by the police.
13) 24) dialog: We're all from here. Back to see the sights. Have a crack at The Golden Mile. Might get messy. (CONTINUED)
13) 28) dialog: We won't! Gary drives off. Stunned silence.
13) 30) dialog: It's simple, Pete. The car's still registered to you, has been since "89.
13) 32) dialog: I know, I changed the log book, I've done this loads of times. Where do you think all those points came from? Seriously. You guys need to relax.
14) 2) dialog: Do you know how much trouble I'm in?
14) 4) dialog: We are here to get annihilated. 28.
15) 2) dialog: Tonight, we will be partaking of a liquid repast as we wend our way up The Golden Mile, commencing with an inaugural tankard at The First Post then onto The Old Familiar, The Famous Cock, The Cross Hands, The Good Companions, The Trusty Servant, The Two Headed Dog, The Mermaid, The Beehive, The King’s Head and The Hole in the Wall for a measure of the same, all before that last bitter sweet pint in that most fateful terminus, The World’s End. Leave a light on good lady, for though we may return with a twinkle in our eyes, we will, in truth be blind... drunk. The landlady stares at Gary.

VARIOUS PASSERSBY regard them with mild indiffere Newton Haven in all its underwhelming glory: Floral displ ring roads, neat avenues. They walk past FIVE TEENAGE BOY and see a reflection of their former selves. Gary nods to them, as if they have something in common. Gary rings someone's doorbell and runs off, forcing the others to do the same. Gary laughs, they don't.
22) 0) text: Gary poised, one foot up on a picnic table like a tour gu
22) 1) dialog: Until 1840-
22) 3) dialog: -this building was the site of Newton Haven's first Post Office. Then an enterprising business fellow decided that, far from benefitting matters of the sending and receiving of mail, it was better suited as a humble tap-room where one could get twatted. (CONTINUED)
23) 0) text: -the shittiest chain pub you’ve ever seen. It’s completel without charm or atmosphere. Gary smiles.
23) 1) dialog: It’s like déja vu.
23) 6) dialog: Can't take away that smell though.
23) 8) dialog: Good evening Raymondo. The prodigal sons return. The publican doesn't seem to recognise Gary.
23) 9) dialog: Who's on the guest list tonight?
23) 11) dialog: The guest ales. We're doing The Golden Mile and you sir, have the honour of drawing first blood. What do you recommend? (CONTINUED)
23) 14) dialog: Rather fitting.
23) 16) dialog: I'm Gary King.
23) 18) dialog: So tell me more.
23) 20) dialog: Crowning Glory. Is it hoppy? Is it nutty? Is it foamy? Does it have a surprisingly fruity note that lingers on the tongue?
23) 22) dialog: Mmmmmm, we'll have five of those then.
23) 24) dialog: You fucking what?!
24) 0) text: The group sits at the same table from the prologue. 31. Gary looks at Andy sipping his water and shakes his head.
24) 1) dialog: I can't believe this, a man of your legendary prowess drinking fucking rain. It's like seeing a lion eating some hummus. (CONTINUED)
24) 5) dialog: I know it doesn't make any sense.
24) 7) dialog: I don't but King Arthur does!
24) 10) dialog: Do you think King Arthur would have come back from the Battle Of Hastings, fucking rocked up at Arthur’s Castle-
24) 12) dialog: - gone to the bar and ordered a tap water?
24) 14) dialog: Exactly. He would have ordered a mead. The King Arthur of beers.
24) 17) dialog: It’s a bit ‘ooh ducky’ innit?
24) 21) dialog: Get out of the nineties mate.
24) 23) dialog: You said it, poof.
24) 25) dialog: I might have kids.
24) 27) dialog: No. I mean I might have kids. Andy and the others look lost.
24) 28) dialog: Remember Karen Eggerton who I... (euphemistic gesture) ... fucked? She was two weeks late when her family emigrated to Normandy. Never heard from her again. She might have had a baby. Imagine that? A French kid.
24) 30) dialog: To kids. Wherever they may be. Gary toasts and drains his Bud.
24) 31) dialog: Come on. Let's boo-boo. (CONTINUED)
24) 35) dialog: You remember? "Let's boo-boo". On the wall of Mr. Shepherd's classroom, it used to say 'Exit, Pursued By Bear', y'know, from the Shakespeare play?
24) 37) dialog: Yeah. What was it called?
24) 39) dialog: That's it. When we needed to make a quick getaway we'd go 'Exit, Pursued By Bear' then 'Exit, Pursued By Yogi Bear', then 'Let's Yogi and Boo-Boo', then 'Let's Boo- Boo'.
24) 41) dialog: Yeah. It’s shit here innit?

26) 4) dialog: David my man, have you heard the news? Gary King is back in town.
27) 3) dialog: It's difficult to put into words. But if I had to choose three, I'd say ‘really, really sad'. Wait, that's two. How about 'really, very sad'? Lot of people wearing black. Lot of hats. Like a wedding, but where someone's dead.
27) 5) dialog: Yeah. Me too. Oliver pipes up loudly and unprompted.
27) 7) dialog: Hello mate.
27) 9) dialog: I’ve been here for ages. Oliver shushes Gary. Indicates he’s on his earpiece.
27) 15) dialog: Who was that, O-Man?
27) 17) dialog: Sam's here?
27) 20) dialog: Calm down Steve, I saw her first.
27) 23) dialog: Someone else was saying that.
27) 25) dialog: No. I would have remembered.
27) 31) dialog: That's right, you did Cabaret at school because she was in it and she wore those fishnets tights and you got a big old boner on stage.
27) 33) dialog: Don't matter anyway, I think she had a massive wide on for Adrian Keane.
27) 36) dialog: Of course. Is she still fit though?
27) 38) dialog: Is she though?
27) 40) dialog: Fit. Steven stands up, like a gentleman.

27) 47) dialog: Steroids.
27) 50) dialog: Wilkommen. Bienvenue. Welcome.
27) 52) dialog: Slow down! She's only just here. Gary shakes his head at Steven. Then-

27) 66) dialog: Well the disableds' is out of order.
27) 68) dialog: I don't know, maybe one of them put too many paper towels down the toilet. We don't really know what they are thinking.
27) 70) dialog: Nothing. Nothing happened to me. I'm the same old Gary.
27) 72) dialog: So, d'you wanna? Sam slaps Gary. Very hard.
28) 0) text: Gary is back at the table. Sam returns.
28) 8) dialog: Out of order. It’s a private joke. Gary laughs it off and pockets the sign.

32) 31) dialog: Classic. Gary again stands to call them over. Andy yanks him down.
32) 33) dialog: You make it sound like we're ancient. We haven't changed that much. Sure, Steve's let himself go but Pete's got the same haircut and O-Man still has his Mark Of the- (sees Oliver's forehead) Oh no, he hasn't. (CONTINUED)

32) 44) dialog: Have it mate.
32) 52) dialog: What happened with Shane Hawkins again?
