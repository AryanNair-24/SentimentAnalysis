6) 18) dialog: You remember the Friday nights. I remember the Monday mornings.
6) 20) dialog: Gary, why do you think none of us live in Newton Haven anymore? Because it’s a black hole. It’s boring and it always was and it always will be.
6) 22) dialog: It’s pointless arguing with you.
6) 24) dialog: No, Gary.

8) 4) dialog: You're late.
8) 6) dialog: It's almost 4, you said 3.
8) 10) dialog: You know your problem Gary? You're never wrong.

12) 1) dialog: I can’t believe you'd do that! What am I saying? Of course I can. It’s just robbing Peter to pay Paul. (CONTINUED)

24) 9) dialog: What's King Arthur got to with it?
24) 16) dialog: And I’m less of a man because I choose to drink water?
24) 22) dialog: Listen there’s nothing ‘ooh ducky’ about being teetotal, about walking into a pub after a rubgy match and ordering a tap water at a bar packed with big ugly bastards wearing war paint. That Gary, takes confidence. I’m talking balls.
24) 24) dialog: I don’t know if you've noticed this but we are not teenagers anymore. I mean, god forbid you ever have children, because if-

32) 17) dialog: (in reverie) Becky Salt. Fuck.
32) 20) dialog: What do you mean?
32) 28) dialog: No let's not get them over. I don't want to see an old Becky Salt. I have the younger model permanently stored up here for special occasions.
32) 30) dialog: School uniform.
32) 32) dialog: Sit the fuck down and leave the past where it is. It's bad enough having to look at your old mugs. Becky Salt? I'll stick with the 20th century version, thank you.
32) 60) dialog: What are you doing, Gary?
32) 64) dialog: Firstly, Peter was talking about something that clearly made him uncomfortable.
32) 66) dialog: It’s not alright, Peter. Secondly 12 pints is more than enough and thirdly, I DON’T FUCKING DRINK!!
32) 68) dialog: Gary, you said you wanted to catch up and chew the fat. I think you just want to drink it. You don’t want us here as your friends. We’re just your fucking enablers.
32) 73) dialog: You don't need us to get fucked up, you've done a perfectly good job so far. For the first time, Gary has no comeback.
32) 74) dialog: I'm going to see if there's a bus going back to London if anyone wants to come with me.
32) 82) dialog: What if it's the twelfth? What's the difference? It's not the same anymore Gary and it isn't that the town's changed, we've changed. Gary checks the time on his phone. Puts it on the table.
32) 84) dialog: Then we'll go back to the B&B. You coming?
32) 88) dialog: That’s settled then.
32) 92) dialog: And this is what you want? You wanna grow up mate. Join society. Gary tries to articulate himself. But can only manage-
32) 94) dialog: I know and we're all sorry but now it’s time to go home.
32) 97) dialog: Don't. We see the caller ID on Gary’s phone. It reads “MUM”.
33) 17) dialog: 
33) 20) dialog: Don't change the subject!
33) 22) dialog: You know who I just spoke to? Your mum! And not from the afterlife. From fucking Bournemouth.
33) 24) dialog: She says she hasn't spoken to you for eight months.
33) 26) dialog: No Gary, you can't wriggle out of this one- (CONTINUED)
33) 37) dialog: I can’t believe it... I can’t believe you lied about your mum!

33) 52) dialog: You just said we don't know how far this goes.
33) 54) dialog: Well there's a surprise.
33) 59) dialog: Must be the network. Gary looks at the bodies on the floor.
33) 66) dialog: You're never wrong.
34) 22) dialog: What?
34) 40) dialog: We finish The Golden Mile. All look to Andy again. He gulps the dregs of Peter's pin

38) 54) dialog: What's going on?
38) 85) dialog: Well what should we do?
40) 8) dialog: Does it have a surprisingly fruity note that lingers on the tongue?
40) 16) dialog: We don’t know what they remember.
40) 19) dialog: Maybe he’s one of the others. Like The Reverend. (CONTINUED)
40) 26) dialog: We need different terms. One for the people who aren’t robots and one for the robots who aren’t robots.
40) 32) dialog: You just used one.
40) 34) dialog: Yeah. "It" is a pronoun.

42) 8) dialog: Don't worry, he's probably just trying to fuck Oliver's sister. (CONTINUED)
44) 2) dialog: Nothing suggested in the last three minutes is better than ‘Smashy- Smashy Egg Men’. Nothing. Gary, Sam and Steve re-enter, all sweaty and grass staine
44) 12) dialog: Gary thinks we should keep on with the crawl, because they know what we're doing but they don't know that we know what they're doing. And basically no one has a better idea so fuck it. Andy crashes through the door, leaving Steven and Sam beh

61) 43) dialog: You want some? I'll smash your fucking heads in! I fucking hate this town! ALL THE BLANKS ATTACK. The brawl is fast, brutal and insa Gary swipes at the blanks with his stool, taking swigs of beer between each blow, still trying to down his pint. (CONTINUED)

64) 37) dialog: Like a man-baby.
64) 40) dialog: The laser surgery!
64) 42) dialog: No wear and tear, no scars.
64) 51) dialog: Or how about December 1997, when you OD'd and I drove you to hospital, four times over the limit and ended up rolling the car and almost severing my femoral artery at which point you made a miraculous recovery and ran off into the night leaving me to get arrested, after the twelve hours of life saving surgery?
64) 58) dialog: Show us your arm.
64) 60) dialog: Show us your arm. (CONTINUED)
64) 64) dialog: You came off your skateboard in fifth year and dislocated your elbow. You’ve got a scar where they put that metal plate in.
64) 66) dialog: It doesn’t say “KING GARY”
64) 68) dialog: It says “KING GAY”.
64) 73) dialog: That means fuck all anyway. Mr. Shepherd remembered stuff, so did Olly. Selective memory, remember? We haven't seen you for years and you brought us here. You better come up with some hard evidence that you're human or we're going to find out for ourselves.
64) 80) dialog: It's Gary. FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE. They look through a window to see a BL PATROL, all using their BRIGHT EYES as searchlights.
64) 81) dialog: Whole town's out looking for us.
64) 83) dialog: Wait, Gary, fuck!
65) 1) dialog: Gary, Gary! What do you mean nobody's inside?
65) 4) dialog: We're still on the crawl. Peter lags behind, blind drunk. He trips and steadies him on a tree. He catches his breath, then sniggers. (CONTINUED)
65) 15) dialog: It’s fucking suicide. Gary stops and turns to them with a grin.
65) 21) dialog: Peter! Leave it! Shane Hawkins reasons with Peter, as his head is smashed

65) 27) dialog: I'll punch their lights out.
65) 35) dialog: (furious) We’re not going to The King’s Head Gary. We're done. We’re going to do what we should have done in the first place, get The Beast and get out of here, we’re fucking leaving and NEVER coming back. Now, you can come with us willingly or I will knock you the fuck out and carry you there myself. Your choice.

66) 16) dialog: Gary, what are you doing?
66) 18) dialog: Gary, put the pint down.

67) 1) dialog: Come back you stupid bastard! Gary barges aside blanks, intent on reaching his goal. We see familiar faces from earlier among the blanks: The VARIOUS PASSERSBY, all THE PUBLICANS they've met. He rips the arm off PUBLICAN 1 and knocks the head off PUBLICAN 3 with the severed limb. As he nears the eleventh pub, he runs over a picnic table and kicks the MOTORCYCLE COP in the face on the way down. Andy knocks aside attackers with the same ferocity. He se Gary up ahead, ducking into The Hole in the Wall. We follow Andy as he makes his way towards the pub, DODGI AND FIGHTING BLANKS of all apparent ages and sizes.

Andy then rips the arms from two of THE TEENS and smashes another two with the same dismembered limbs.

69) 12) dialog: Of course I fucking care. There's a reason I'm angry at you, you idiot!
69) 16) dialog: I don't care about that. It's not the point. I got better. You didn't. You let me down man. That's why I'm angry. You were Gary King. Gary fucking King. I believed in you. I would have followed you to the fucking end. Jesus, I have!
69) 19) dialog: What are you talking about?
69) 21) dialog: You think it's all perfect? She left me Gary. Do you honestly believe I'd be here if I didn't have an empty house? She took the kids to her mum's three weeks ago. Said I'm not "present" enough. You think I gave up? No, I'm trying to win her back. God know's, I'm losing but I'm gonna keep fighting Gary, because that's how we survive. For fuck's sake, I just punched my wedding ring out of a robot's tummy.
69) 23) dialog: What’s so important about The Golden Mile?
69) 27) dialog: You need help Gary. Andy grabs the other hand, revealing not only another ban but a hospital ID bracelet. Realisation dawns. Gary pushes a shocked Andy onto the ground.
69) 29) dialog: And this is? It can’t all be a good time, things have to be bad sometimes, otherwise you’1l never know how ‘good’ really feels.

70) 0) text: A section of the pub sits in a dark chamber underneath Ne Haven. Cables and pipes line the walls, evidence of the active network. Only the shaft of light from the World's above lights the sunken pub floor below. There is a DEEP HUM. Gary and Andy peer into the darkness the surrounding chamber. Around them, on two higher ledge the chamber, stand a SHADOWY CIRCLE OF BLANKS looking dow Gary lifts up the bar to investigate.
70) 1) dialog: Gary, don't go out there- As soon as Gary steps out, a THUNDERING VOICE BOOMS.
70) 43) dialog: Whoa whoa whoa, who put you in charge? Who are you to criticize anyone? Gary might be a bit of a cock and in fact he is a bit of a cock but he's my cock.
70) 45) dialog: Now I'm not going to lie and say this man is some sort of shining example, far from it. And I'm not saying that it's wrong to ask for help, it's not. But help must be asked for, otherwise it's just control.
70) 47) dialog: What did you say?
70) 52) dialog: He’s saying we’re a bunch of fuck ups.
70) 54) dialog: And me!

70) 70) dialog: Wait, you said you're not here to conquer, can I just ask, out of interest, how many people did you have to replace in Newton Haven?
70) 72) dialog: Is it? Hands up who here is human. Mumbling from the circle. One hand goes up.
70) 78) dialog: 
70) 83) dialog: You had to replace an entire town?
70) 88) dialog: What happened to the ones you replaced? Like Oliver and Pete?
70) 94) dialog: And what about the other places? The penetration points. Gary sniggers and makes a euphemistic hand gesture. (CONTINUED)
70) 97) dialog: Are they as “successful” as Newton Haven? Because I’m guessing we’re not the only glitch in your system.
70) 102) dialog: Because we are more belligerent, more stubborn, more idiotic than you can possibly imagine and I’m not just talking about Gary.
70) 110) dialog: Just eff off. (CONTINUED)
70) 115) dialog: We're not asking your permission.

71) 13) dialog: I promised myself I wouldn’t die in this town. Gary hears a familiar RATTLING approach through the smoke
72) 9) dialog: I know. Andy puts his arm around Gary. They sit regarding Armaged
73) 0) text: An older Andy talks to a group of younger people around a fire. He is dressed in a medieval looking mish-mash of contemporary clothing. The look and feel of these scenes post apocalyptic and neo-gothic, with much swirling smoke
73) 1) dialog: That morning gave new meaning to the word 'hangover'. We decided to walk it off, all the way back to London, but the headache didn't end there - it just went on and on. When The Network went down, it triggered a pulse that wiped out all our technology and sent us here, back to the Dark Ages. We see the Earth reflected in Andy's glasses, we see puls waves spread out all over the globe and then... black out
73) 2) dialog: There were casualties of course. I knew a few. Some guy at work, my cousin, Gary's mum. Nobody could be sure how many we lost, because we never heard from the rest of the world again. Things aren't connected like they used to be. Everyone got cut off. We see Andy on his property with his wife and kids, tendi an area of arable land, surrounded by a chain link fence.
73) 3) dialog: Some people say it was better when they were here. I can see that. It isn't easy now but it is simpler. I'm back with the wife which is something. We decided our problems didn't seem as bad in the grand scheme. We live off the land, provide for the family. We all had to go organic in a big way, but if I'm honest, I'm hard pressed to recall any processed foods I miss. A MINT CORNETTO WRAPPER flutters onto the fence and then flies away. Andy's slavering chops betray him.
73) 4) dialog: As for the blanks, well a funny thing happened there. They woke up. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
73) 7) dialog: A week or so after The Network pulled out, they just sort of rebooted by themselves. We see blackened figures in the burnt out catacombs come life. The blanks awake. Peter blinks. Oliver sits up to discover that his head is missing once again. He frowns.
73) 8) dialog: They seemed lost at first, children cut off from their parents. I felt a bit sorry for them to be honest. The blanks stumble through society. Some are pelted with tomatoes. Some reunite with tearful relatives. Oliver pas graffiti reading ‘WE ARE NOT ROBOTS’. He gets dirty looks from passersby. He gives them the finger, mouths “fuck of
73) 9) dialog: The Network was right about one thing. We don’t play nice with others. The Network was right about a few things to be fair. Oliver went back to being an estate agent. People still need a roof over their heads and the old Olly always had a gift for the gab. I guess the new one has too. Oliver, now wearing half a football in place of his missi head, shows a young couple into a rough dwelling. He attempts to follow them but bumps into the door jamb.
73) 10) dialog: I hear the Petertron went home. He remembered enough to know where Bishop’s Gardens was. I suppose he just picked up where he left off. We see Peter approach his now overgrown and half-shuttere house in Bishop’s Gardens.
73) 11) dialog: I’m not sure his wife noticed. Maybe she chose not to. He’s a pretty good dad by all accounts. We see Peter sat round the breakfast table with his kids burnt out kitchen. He takes off his hand and lets it scut round the table. Everyone laughs. His wife enters, Peter quickly reattaches his hand and winks at his children. (CONTINUED)
73) 14) dialog: Steven and Sam got together in the end. Didn’t see that coming. They shacked up just outside London. It’s a pretty nice shack too. Sam and Steven appear on the doorstep of an impressive looking shack. Sam kisses Steven who slings a shotgun ove his shoulder and strides off, presumably to go hunting.
73) 15) dialog: As for Gary? Andy looks ruefully into the distance as he remembers his friend, almost forgetting he is addressing the group.
73) 16) dialog: I don’t know what happened to Gary. We got separated and I never saw him again. Some say he went back to Newton Haven. I don’t know why, I think his business there was done.
74) 1) dialog: Wherever he is, I hope he’s happy. It’s funny but I miss him. I wonder if he misses me. Striding behind him, the BLANK TEENAGE VERSIONS OF ANDY, STEVEN, OLIVER AND PETER. They are somewhat blackened, wi modifications to their garb. They too carry medieval weap Gary leads them to a pub that stands alone in the smoky apocalyptic wasteland: ‘THE RISING SUN’ He brings them to a halt at the door of the pub and regar the sign made out of number plates. It reads ‘NO BL4 NKS’
