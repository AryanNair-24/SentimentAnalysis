We tend to think that a little anxiety and worry are simply an indication of how wise we are yet it’s a much better indication of how wicked we are. Fretting arises from our determination to have our own way. Our Lord never worried and was never anxious, because His purpose was never to accomplish his own plans but to fulfill God's plans...” Esther looks out door, notices Toller walking down the corridor.
