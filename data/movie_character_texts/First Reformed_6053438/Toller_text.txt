His angular bo lists to the right, as if resisting weight. He is in Agon And he writes.
2) 1) dialog: I will keep this diary for one year, twelve months and at the end of that time it will be destroyed. Shredded, then burnt. The experiment will be over. “Pass Me Not” draws to a finish. JOHN ELDER, 60, the stee guitarist, steps back and takes a seat. Wider angles reveal the nature of the sanctuary, a functi colonial rectangle lined with white painted pews. High stained glass windows let light in from above. The walls lined with memorial plaques and remembrances. Seven PARISHIONERS stand in the pews. Three single elder worshippers, one middle aged couple and one younger coupl token turnout at best. Reverend Toller, dressed in a collarless cassock, stands the pulpit. He reads from the Heidelberg Catechism:

Michael stands at a distance as Mary awaits the communion cup. An Older Man and Older Woman fill out the group. John Elder assists Toller as he offers the silver communi plate and tray holding bread squares and wine cups. Esther and Toller exchange looks as she accepts the wine.

John Elder counts out the collection from the offertory, places the bills in a small lock box. The Vestry, like the sanctuary, shows age and use. One bi decor contrasts with the Old New England ambience of the room: a framed poster of the Abundant Life in Christ Chur of Fellowship, a mega church in a rural setting surrounde parking spaces. “We are Spirit-filled ... Non-denominatio «+. Evangelistic ... Welcoming.” A smiling photo of Joel Jeffers, “Head Pastor,” a fit black 60 year-old preacher dark T shirt, invites newcomers to services. Toller stacks the communion plate it on a shelf beside th collection plates.

Central Africa, fifty percent reduction in crops due to drought. The western reservoirs dried up. Climate change refugees. Epidemics. Extreme weather. CLOSEUP of wall map as Toller speaks over.

14) 23) dialog: Do you have thoughts of harming yourself?
14) 25) dialog: No, she didn’t.
14) 28) dialog: You say what a father has always said. “I love you without qualification.” Michael responds with a sardonic smile.
14) 29) dialog: There is something growing inside Mary. Something as surely alive as a tree or an endangered species. Something filled with nature’s beauty. You speak of “sanctioning” this birth-- is it really your decision? Do you have that right? What does Mary think? Michael doesn’t answer.
14) 30) dialog: It is her decision?
14) 32) dialog: You've told her that? (Michael nods) So it is not about the child. Or about Mary. It is about you and your despair. Your lack of hope. (beat) Throughout history humans have woken up in the dead of night, confronted by blackness. The sense that life is without meaning. The Suffering Unto Death.
14) 35) dialog: Do you believe there is existence apart from this...? Gestures to indicate the material world.
14) 37) dialog: Before us? After us?
14) 39) dialog: I felt like I was Jacob wrestling all night long with the angel. Fighting in the grasp. Every sentence, every question, every response a mortal struggle. Fighting for existence itself. It was exhilarating. Michael brings us back to the moment:
14) 41) dialog: I’m not sure what you mean.
14) 43) dialog: I do.
14) 46) dialog: You said you respected me. What I'd gone through.
14) 48) dialog: You know my story?

14) 52) dialog: Six months later he was killed in Iraq. There was no moral justification for this conflict. My wife could not live with me after that. Who could blame her? I left the military. Rev Jeffers at Abundant Life Church heard about my situation. They offered me a position at First Reformed. And here I am.
14) 53) dialog: Michael, whatever despair you feel about bringing a child into this world cannot equal the despair of taking a child out of it.
14) 55) dialog: Joseph.
14) 57) dialog: The boy thrown in the well.
14) 59) dialog: The Old Calvinists used to preach a doctrine called the “Unforgiveable Sin.” You don’t hear about it any more. It was the sin against the Holy Spirit. It was the sin against Hope. The only sin that lies beyond forgiveness. (beat) It comes down to choice. We choose hope or despair. We cannot avoid choosing. We are not free to not decide. It’s what we truly are. Courage is the solution to despair. (beat) Reason offers no answers. We cannot be certain what the future holds. We must choose despite uncertainty. (MORE )

14) 66) dialog: I don’t know. Who can know the mind of God? Perhaps we are a way station. But we can choose. To live the righteous life, to believe, to forgive. Grace covers us all. Michael looks away. Checks his watch.
14) 67) dialog: We will speak again. Promise me that. (Michael hesitates) I won’t leave until you promise.

16) 2) dialog: Despair is a form of pride. “I know that nothing can change and I know there is no hope.” Merton wrote about this. (MORE )
16) 4) dialog: Despair is a development of pride so great that it chooses one’s certitude rather than admit God is more creative than we are. Perhaps it’s better I didn’t say that to him.

28) 6) dialog: Eight weeks.
28) 8) dialog: The invitations are being handled by your office. We don’t have that many seats. Your staff, the Elders and Deacons, ecumenical representatives, the Mayor, the Governor--there’s no overflow room. The sanctuary, that’s it.

I’m going to tear these pages out. This journal brings me no peace. It’s self-pity, nothing more. Toller, at his computer, researches “Hanstown, NY.” Micha Will and Testiment lies open beside him. “Hanstown Paint Works and Storage.” He brings up images.

For the part they are Michael's friends and fellow activists. Mar there with her parents, her sister and brother-in-law and their young child. As is Esther with her a capella choir group. A MOURNER records with a digital camera, panning from Tol to Mary’s nephew who reacts to the foul smelling creek. John Elder stands at his keyboard. Toller reads from his Bible:
56) 1) dialog: Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm. He said: “Who is this that obscures my plans with words without knowledge? Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation? Who marked off its dimensions? Who laid its cornerstone while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?”... TIMECUT. Mary stands beside Toller holding a plain urn bearing Michael’s ashes.
56) 2) dialog: These surroundings were chosen by Michael as the repository for his physical remains. I say physical because Michael’s spirt and memories live on with us. As does his mission. Michael cared about this world. Perhaps too much. Suffering does not hold. Is not the last word. Resurrection has sway. He’s gone but not his mission. It lives on within us. Mary will lead family and friends in the spreading of Michael’s ashes as the Abundant Life Youth a capella Choir sings a song chosen by Michael. Esther escorts the four person Youth Choir up the steps o the platform. They wear matching khaki pants and blue pol They arrange themselves, look at Esther.
