Ten years ago, Roberta Guaspari walked  into my office because she needed a  job, and because she had a vision  that any child could learn the violin.  We put our dreams together and created  the East Harlem Violin Program which  has helped more than a thousand  students expand their vision of what's  possible in their lives. When a  program like this is cut, our  children's future is compromised. I  want to thank you for your support.  Enjoy the concert.
