82) 131) dialog: Maybe you could just give me a list of all your exes so at least I know who's going to beat my ass into the ground next.
82) 133) dialog: Just out of sheer curiosity and concern for my mortal well-being, is there anyone at this party you haven't slept with?
82) 137) dialog: As in 'get out of here'? Or as in 'split split'?
82) 153) dialog: How could I not? I feel like we just washed our sexy laundry in public.
