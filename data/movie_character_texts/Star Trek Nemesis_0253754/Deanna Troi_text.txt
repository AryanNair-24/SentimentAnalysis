6) 13) dialog: And you needn't worry.  I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
6) 20) dialog: (smiles) All right, go ahead. Riker eagerly joins the band.  Grabs the trombone and sta jamming with the orchestra.  The song really swings.
6) 22) dialog: With pleasure, Captain. Meanwhile, Geordi leads Leah to the dance floor as well. Beverly goes to Worf.

23) 3) dialog: Do you have a moment, sir?
23) 5) dialog: It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong.  I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
23) 7) dialog: The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian.  I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences.  He'll be disappointed when the B-9 cannot meet those expectations.

33) 0) text: Beverly stands with Picard, Riker and Deanna.  The Reman knife is under a protonmicroscope and other medical reado and analysis are visible.
34) 1) dialog: I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy.  What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
34) 3) dialog: I don't know. (she stops him) Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than curious about you.  He very much wants to know you. (she looks at him deeply) The same way you want to know him.
34) 5) dialog: Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are.  You should resist the urge to think you know him.
35) 1) dialog: Will, you need to rest. (he continues to work) As ship's counselor, I'm recommending you get me sleep. Riker tosses a padd on the desk.  Rubs his eyes.  Looks u her.
35) 3) dialog: We have time. (she kisses him) Come to bed. She pulls him up.

To leave all of this behind and be with me. He pushes her against the wall, with passion and almost violence. DEANNA
45) 5) text: I can feel your desire, Deanna... She forces herself to concentrate... to resist telepathically... it is a mighty effort... this Romulan i hot.  And the world around her appears to be changing... bending... And she is momentarily in a cabin on the Scimitar.  Altho entirely a telepathic experience, it is as if she has actually traveled. She sees Shinzon kneeling over a small flame, she realize she is looking through the Viceroy's eyes. On the Scimitar, Shinzon looks up at the Viceroy/Deanna: SHINZON

116) 0) text: The Scimitar sweeps into view on the viewscreen -- fillin the screen -- and launches a ferocious volley of photon torpedoes. A huge EXPLOSION as the viewscreen and some of the forwar bridge are BLOWN APART -- the Helm Officer is SUCKED INTO SPACE before a flickering emergency force field springs i position -- Deanna races to assume the helm -- Picard can now see his enemy directly through the gaping in the ship's hull -- he sees the Scimitar banking for another attack run as part of the ship disappears -- GEORDI

Geordi sta on the upper rear deck, head down. A long beat as Picard just stands on his ruined bridge, t thousand-yard stare of a combat veteran in his eyes. Riker emerges from the turbolift.
