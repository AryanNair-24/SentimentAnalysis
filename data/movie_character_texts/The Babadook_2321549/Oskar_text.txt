She races around randomly stuffing things back in boxes. She clocks the photo of her and Oskar, walks over, picks it up, puts it in her pocket, unable to even look at it. She turns and what she sees makes her jump with fright. Samuel has fixed a hat, shirt and trousers to the wall, using his father’s things to replicate a person. A pair of shoes rest under each trouser leg. Oskar’s violin is out of its case, propped up against the wall, as if the shirt arm were holding it. Amelia's fright subsides overtaken by a terrible remorse that hits her right in the guts. Tears well in her eyes. 46 47 36.

Oskar’s things are still there, but now very neatly stacked in one corner. Amelia places the bowl of slop in the centre of the room. She steps back and waits, peering into the darkness. She's frightened, but does her best to conceal it. The rumbling increases. She can see a familiar shadow in the corner, moving ever so slightly. A low insect like noise.

She lets out a low guttural warning sound, then a shout, full of power.. Her back releases slightly, she is able to right herself, standing eye to eye with something we don’t see. Her face is tense, her pupils dilate. She looks afraid but something else is there now. Something soft and sad.
