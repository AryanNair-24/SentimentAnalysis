All the lights still on. The TV is up loud. Amelia tries desperately to stay awake, absently hitting the remote. Commercials, nature program, soap opera. An old black and white George Méliés clip appears on the screen. Beautiful silent images, childlike but slightly disturbing. Just like the Babadook book. A weird tinkling lullaby accompanies them, seducing her to sleep. She fights it, her head nodding forward and back, a drowsy agitation, desperate to stay awake. The Méliés images stream in front of her. People dismembered, heads growing larger and smaller, old style cinema tricks. Strange and sinister. Emotions pass over Amelia’s face as she watches, agitation, amusement, exhaustion, fear. Something is brewing. She jerks forward and back, her eyes heavy. Her face speeds up. It looks bizarre. The tinkly piano music continues to play. And still she doesn’t sleep. Amelia's face returns to normal speed, she looks around. The sun is coming through the windows. It’s already morning. She leans over. Something doesn’t feel right. She looks to Samuel asleep on the couch, his back to her. Bugsy peers over Samuel, studying Amelia with caution. She returns the dog’s stare, unblinking. There’s an eery silence in the room. She looks at the TV. It’s on mute. Amelia suddenly lurches forward and manages to stand. She centres herself momentarily, then shuffles to the stairs. 66. INT.
