16) 7) dialog: Are you afraid or just embarrassed to be seen with me, Mr. Aiken?
16) 9) dialog: If you will be so kind, please tell her not to worry. She begins to close the door.
17) 2) dialog: Business tends to slow down when there's a soldier stationed out front day and night for my "protection".
17) 4) dialog: Yes. Aiken moves from room-to-room -- each strikingly cozy and familial. DAGUERREOTYPES of the Surratts line the mantels
17) 6) dialog: Pardon.
17) 8) dialog: Please, do tell. Aiken says nothing.
17) 9) dialog: Mr. Aiken, I'm sure I've heard much worse in the past month. 28.
17) 11) dialog: No one would ever suspect, right? Aiken doesn't know what to make of Anna.
17) 13) dialog: My brother's room is the third on the left.
18) 1) dialog: Find what you were looking for? Aiken quickly recovers. Rises.
18) 3) dialog: That's correct.
18) 5) dialog: No, I haven't. Did you see much action? Anna is staring at Aiken's UNIFORM.
18) 7) dialog: Kill any on our side? A beat. 29.
18) 11) dialog: Such as?
18) 13) dialog: Do you have siblings, Mr. Aiken?
18) 15) dialog: I thought not. Suddenly, there is a tremendous CRASH -- Glass sprays across the floor Aiken dives on top of Anna, placing them nose-to-nose. A large ROCK rests beside them, inscribed in blood-red:
20) 0) text: Aiken commands Anna, his gun still drawn.
20) 2) dialog: I'm not going anywhere.
20) 4) dialog: I've managed thus far. She places the rock on a shelf, steps back revealing a sm pile of similar rocks.

30) 8) dialog: Because you never would've offered it in Court.
30) 10) dialog: Chain of Custody: the ability to guarantee evidence from collection to presentation in Court. Off Aiken's surprised look, Anna explains --
30) 11) dialog: Counselor, a boardinghouse with no guests leaves one with plenty of spare time. Then nods to a stack of law journals nearby.
30) 13) dialog: Meaning?
30) 15) dialog: Wonderful, Mr. Aiken. Now, you're accusing me of "building the. nest". At least you're introducing reasonable doubt for my mother. Smash! Anna whacks a broken pane from the window.
30) 17) dialog: I can manage.
30) 19) dialog: Thanks just the same. But my father and brother's example taught me never to depend on a man. A beat.
30) 21) dialog: A while. And he didn't work hard enough.
30) 23) dialog: Lou was too much of a coward to devote himself to the Cause. That's why I'd never consider marrying him.
30) 25) dialog: Don't seem so surprised by the notion Mr. Aiken. Fact is, I was in love with a man -- not_a boy. Lt. Wiechmann didn't like that.
30) 27) dialog: For it is written, vengeance is mine.
30) 29) dialog: Are you more interested in me or defending my mother, Colonel?
30) 31) dialog: I don't have the slightest idea.
44) 0) text: Aiken stumbles home dripping wet and drunk. He crosses inside his modest flat -- legal briefs, army mementoes and dirty clothes are strewn about. Framed DAGUERREOTYPES fill his mantel, including one of a young woman (Aiken's MOTHER). A closer look reveals she's inside a coffin, her death portrait. Another image is of young Aiken with his very formal-looking FATHER. A portra of PRESIDENT LINCOLN is the last photo shown. Aiken's windows are also broken like Anna's -- a ROCK pil is on the sill. One is inscribed: DIE REBEL DIE. Aiken begins removing his soggy clothes to prepare for sl suddenly, a HAND grabs his bare shoulder from behind. Aiken whirls, takes the attacker's feet out from under hi knocks him to the ground, and pins him...pins HER!
44) 3) dialog: She's very beautiful. (Off Aiken's confusion) I saw you go in your club tonight. Aiken rolls off of Anna.
44) 5) dialog: You still want to know where he is? Another beat.
44) 7) dialog: I found out how... Aiken cuts her off. 84. Please. I never should've put you in this position. I'm so sorry.
44) 8) dialog: Can you save my mother without him? (no reply) Can you, Fred? A long pause.

46) 7) dialog: I can't say. 87.
46) 9) dialog: I don't know if he was involved. I only know that my mother was not. Aiken glances at Wiechmann, seated in the gallery. Anna nods.
46) 11) dialog: It's not true. He's lying. (turns to wiechmann) How could you? She would sit up and wait for you at night, the same as for my own brother.
46) 15) dialog: She said she did not_understand why strange persons should call there.
46) 17) dialog: She Supposed their object was to see my brother.
46) 19) dialog: Yes.
46) 21) dialog: Yes. 88.

46) 31) dialog: It was given to me by that man Wiechmann.
46) 33) dialog: Yes. I went to a daguerrean gallery one day to get a picture taken. I saw some photographs of Mr. Booth there, and being acquainted with him, I bought one, and took it home.
46) 35) dialog: When my brother saw it, he told me to tear it up and throw it in the fire. And that if I did not, he would take it from me.
46) 37) dialog: You'll have to ask him.
46) 40) dialog: But I'm telling the truth. My mother is innocent.
46) 44) dialog: You've got to believe me.

56) 8) dialog: The War is far from over, John. There's still much we can do! (John doesn't budge) Don't be like Pa. Have the courage to see something through. John angrily turns away, and storms up the stairs.
56) 10) dialog: Mr. Booth.
56) 12) dialog: "Lovely". Indeed, you are a fine actor. Anna removes her apron in an attempt to make herself presentable.
56) 13) dialog: How long have you been there?
56) 15) dialog: Thank you, Mr. Booth. That's a compliment I will accept. There is an undeniable chemistry here. Off-screen, Mary and her son are in a heated conversation (NOTE: The rest of this scene is familiar from earlier in the script -- only we saw it from Mary's POV, not Anna's.
56) 19) dialog: Think what you will, Mr. Booth, but he's still my brother.
56) 25) dialog: it should be my face on this -- not is. Aiken remains silent.
56) 26) dialog: I am such a coward. He's my younger brother. I should've protected him. But instead, I pushed him into it.
56) 28) dialog: I know now. And yet I still told you where to find him, and damned im on the stand.
56) 31) dialog: But it's the truth.
59) 22) dialog: Please, Mama. Don't... Aiken moves toward the door to give them privacy. MARY ; You've heard from my son, Frederick haven't you? Aiken stops in his tracks.

74) 15) dialog: Please. Tell them they can't. Aiken scans the Executive Order. His expression indicates there's nothing he can do. As the Soldiers begin to escor Mary, she clasps her BIBLE and ROSARY beads.
74) 17) dialog: Let go of her. And she pounces on the soldiers. They quickly restrain An as the Prison Doctor injects her with a sedative. 112.
74) 18) dialog: Please, God. Don't No. Mama. No.... let them hurt her. Anna screams as her mother is being led away. Mary, stric with concern, calls out.

A GUARD unlocks a METAL DOOR as the PRISONERS -- Atzerodt Herold, Payne and Mary Surratt -- are led from their CELL Mary clenches ROSARY BEADS firmly in her RIGHT HAND. 115. The Prison Doctor tends to Anna inside Mary's cell. He pl her hand across her chest -- Mary's HAIR BRACELET now res on Anna's heart. Aiken abandons his buggy in TRAFFIC, and begins weaving h way through the crowd. He throws off his UNION JACKET as passing carriage rides over it, grinding it into the grou Inside the PRISON COURTYARD, HUNDREDS of SPECTATORS and P excitedly await the spectacle about to happen. A Soldier opens a BLACK PARASOL over Mary's head to chivalrously shield her from the broiling midday SUN. The FOUR PRISONERS are now led across the COURTYARD, forced t pass a GAUNTLET of onlookers on their way to the GALLOWS. Aiken navigates a gauntlet of his own OUTSIDE the PRISON WALLS as VENDORS gleefully hawk LEMONADE and CAKES. Mary ascends the GALLOWS where the HANGMAN now awaits. Ai ushes past the MOBS, racing inside the PRISON WALLS. Fath alter, now by Mary's side, administers FINAL RITES. The other THREE PRISONERS are readied, with WHITE HOODS covering their heads to conceal their panicked faces.

Aiken rushes inside the COURTYARD, past BAKER and CATHERI desperate to see Mary before it's too late. He spots Mary. She sees him too. A SMALL SMILE springs to her lips. Aiken SMILES BACK, wiping tears from his eyes. He nods one LAST TIME to her. And she to him. The HANGMAN places the HOOD and NOOSE over Mary's head, a Aiken looks away -- unable to watch any more. Aiken feels a HAND on his shoulder. It belongs to REVERDY JOHNSON, who buttresses Aiken for what's about to happen.
