1) 114) dialog: I'm JULIA. She raised one hand from his back to the back of his head presses his face to hers. JULIA plays it exactly as a sensual, passionate kiss, her wide open, her head moving rhythmically and sinuously. KYLE's reaction is somewhat different; his arms flail in (though only from the elbow - JULIA'S grip prevents anyth more) and his head makes jerking, backward movements agai pressing hand. The camera moves around the embracing couple until it is JULIA. The back of her gown, as we know, is extremely low. As th continues, we see skin creeping above the line of the gow base of her spine and gradually flowing up her back until it meets and blends perfectly with ragged and raw edges o skin at her neck and shoulders. JULIA is complete again. While this process has been going on, KYLE has been dying and horribly in her arms, his lifeforce being sucked into through their open mouths. His body, by the time her back completely formed, is shrunken, hollow, and dried up. JULIA takes her arms from around the corpse of KYLE and s back, allowing the husk to fall to the floor.

He is gazing a room where the floor is a vast, seething pool of maggot Suddenly, something breaks the surface. It would doubtles were its mouth not full of maggots. It is BROWNING.

11) 0) text: MALAHIDE and JULIA are at the end of a corridor. They tur an open space. A vast open space. It is desert-like in it expanse, almost vanishing into infinity at its furthest r It is criss-crossed by catwalks, on one of which MALAHIDE JULIA now stand. Beside these catwalks, the ground falls into mile-deep, dark, abysses. Above the catwalks, dominating the huge space, is the mas the labyrinth. The master, LEVIATHAN, is a monumentally huge, white, mul faceted diamond, spinning on its own axis, entirely unsup by any physical means, above its territory. Apart from its very immensity, the most unsettling thing LEVIATHAN are the beams of black light that shine out fro corners of all its many facets. Due to the fast spinning, beams shoot and swoop around the chamber, like a negative display of dazzling complexity. The sound that has been in the corridors is now magnified the sound of LEVIATHAN's breath. MALAHIDE has walked the last few yards like a man in sho a black beam strikes his face and images of horror flash his eyes at almost subliminal speed. His face suddenly cr into an expression of incredulous terror, he makes a nois halfway between screaming and retching, and drops to his the edge of the catwalk. Unfortunately, this allows him to look down into LEVIATHA Looking down with him, we are given a sudden and vertigin sickening realization of Hell's immensities. There is a d miles visible down the pit and, all the way down, as far eye can see, there are other catwalks cutting across the various angles. MALAHIDE looks back up, his scream renewed by his sight o pit. Two or three of the beams of black light flit across face, filling his eyes with more subliminal images of hor pass; a child, a knife, and a dead animal; a naked woman private parts are made of sharp, oily, metal; perfect han ending in crumbling, leprous fingers. Suddenly, LEVIATHAN stops spinning. Effortlessly. Instant more beams are projected at MALAHIDE but, as they come wi few yards of him, they become writhing pink limbs that fl sieze MALAHIDE and lift him into the air. He screams out.

The purple and pink walls of this flesh gash peel apart a in various places to reveal blades, hooks and needles at of various vestigial limbs. The limbs holding MALAHIDE draw him back inexorably into cavity. He has one last moment to meet JULIA's eyes.

MALAHIDE is now held within the walls of the gash.

JULIA smiles.
11) 4) dialog: Goodbye, Doctor. It's been real. The gash heals itself, closing MALAHIDE within. Despite the gash having closed over MALAHIDE, the leather that covers that area is a mass of movement, ripples and Small rips and gashes appear and disappear on its surface us occasional and partial glimpses of MALAHIDE and what i happening to him. At one stage MALAHIDE's hand and forearm appear. A long d running cut has been made down the arm and the flesh peel folded back, revealing the meat and the muscle beneath. A watch, two of the tiny operating limbs sew the flaps of f still folded back, to the rest of the arm, leaving the wo and un-healable. Another gash opens and MALAHIDE's face is visible. Here t needles are at work, diving into and out of his flesh in complicated sewing pattern that is finally pulled togethe beneath one ear, leaving MALAHIDE's features permanently out of shape and decorated with running stitches of metal Again, MALAHIDE's torso appears, naked. Two large triangu blades make deep parallel slashes down his chest. Two dif limbs appear but these have sucker-like tips rather than ones. They fasten onto the new cuts, as if battening. Ins they are injecting - as becomes apparent when MALAHIDE's turns blue. The blueness, the conscious disfigurement, and the almost decorative open wounds should serve to convey that what i happening to MALAHIDE is not simply torture; he is being transformed into a CENOBITE. JULIA watches with avid interest.
