She siezes the wrist of the arm that KIRSTY has rais a clenched fist and effortlessly throws KIRSTY bodily bac the room. We realise for the first time the immense physi strength that JULIA now possesses. KIRSTY smashes into the door and falls to a sitting posit against it.

For a second it looks as if KI persuasions have succeeded, but MALAHIDE's training has b thorough; TIFFANY knows a puzzle when she sees one. She s once more at KIRSTY and then suddenly turns and disappear the corridor. KIRSTY stands still for a moment, as if she can't quite b that TIFFANY has done it.

Suddenly TIFFANY makes a sharp turn and enters an interse corridor. KIRSTY is forced to increase her speed even mor KIRSTY too makes the turn into another corridor. Even as so, she sees TIFFANY disappearing again into yet another intersection. KIRSTY follows and, again, the same thing happens. This happens several times and, always, KIRSTY never quit sight of TIFFANY but never quite catches up with her eith In short, TIFFANY's instincts were absolutely right; this another puzzle. The girls are lost in a concrete maze, fu twists and turns and labyrinthine windings. After enough turns have been made to completely confuse K sense of direction, she makes a final turn into one corri sees something different. At the end of this corridor is a blinding white light. As KIRSTY sees the light, the air is filled with beautiful birdsong. TIFFANY disappears into the light as soon as KIRSTY sees Despite the light, despite the birdsong, KIRSTY is still suspicious and shouts out.

The walls contain portals of a like substance at random intervals that emit blooming lig different colors and MALAHIDE peers eagerly into several In one, the view is like an aquarium.

Despite the aparent Summer light in the room, KIRSTY sudd realises what it is that is odd. She looks from wall to wall with mounting distress on her There are no windows in the room. And no door. At this point, the odd discordant note in the birdsong be apparent. It is nothing too obvious at the moment - the t effect is simply less sweet than it was. KIRSTY looks back at the photograph and snatches it up, w look of concern. The photograph has changed. It is now a wedding photo. Th wedding of LARRY and JULIA. Suddenly the photograph begins to bleed. Blood pours from paper itself, pressing up and smearing against the glass- it is momentarily framed blood, without a single trace of picture showing. The blood begins to escape out of the fr trickling over the lip that holds the glass in place and onto KIRSTY's fingers. With a cry of horror, KIRSTY drops the frame. It lands on floor and the glass shatters. The blood continues to flow fact, now that the glass does not restrain it, it fairly fountains out, spreading across the floor. KIRSTY steps back and glances at the dresser. Blood is fl from every frame, pooling on the dresser and overflowing floor. By now, the discordant elements in the birdsong are very predominant and, as KIRSTY sweeps all the frames off the and onto the floor with a scream of anguish, the birdsong way completely to a hideous, dissonant shrieking. KIRSTY throws her hands to her ears.

He turns the box rapidly through positions KIRSTY and we never seen before - even opening it out at one stage into large, two-dimensional square. Finally, it closes itself but in a wholly new shape; a white, multi-faceted, diamon - and drops back into KIRSTY's hands. He stares at KIRSTY and makes a small gesture with his br is ALMOST cute.

Accompanying this tightening, the light in the corridors gradually murkier - not quite dark, more like the oppress colourlessness that descends before a thunderstorm breaks Occasionally there are little hissing noises from the wal themselves, which are accompanied by small jets of dull a smoke escaping between the bricks. Over all this, there grows in volume on the soundtrack a rhythmic, labored, resonant sound - a sound somewhere bet breathing and machinery.

It's wall-papered walls were once white but are now yello old. Overhead there is an equally ancient four bladed woo that turns sluggishly. In the middle of the floor is a small low table of vaguel Eastern design. On this table lie a hand of cards, face down, an empty an tumbler, and a soiled ashtray. Over by the far wall (the wall opposite to that containin door) there is a mattress on the floor. A body like shape mattress is obscured by a heavy blanket that covers it. To the side of the mattress a latticed wooden screen stan hiding whatever is behind it from those entering the room atmosphere of the room reminds us of anything it is of t bazaar where FRANK first bought the LAMENT CONFIGURATION. We are looking at the door as it opens inwards and KIRSTY and nervously walks into the room. KIRSTY advances into the room. She stares at the mattress of her.
