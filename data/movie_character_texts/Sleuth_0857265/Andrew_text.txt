INT, ANDREW'S HOUSE - DUSK: MILO'S Pov. 27 The interior design of the house is in total contrast to the classic Georgian facade. It is sharply contemporary: polished wooden floors, no carpets, chrome surfaces, steel and iron verticals, an elevator in a glass case, a curved staircase. A skylight, high up.
23) 2) dialog: Like the house?
23) 4) dialog: You know who designed it? You know who the interior decorator was?
23) 6) dialog: You knew.
23) 8) dialog: I'll show you around later. You good in elevators?
23) 10) dialog: Like not safe in taxis. Sorry. (he laughs) Only joking. Have a drink. I'm drinking vodka.
23) 12) dialog: Milo. What an interesting name. You're a foreigner, I take it.
23) 14) dialog: Milo sounds Hungarian.
23) 16) dialog: Here's your scotch. Cheers.
23) 19) dialog: And your mother?
23) 21) dialog: So you're a kind of half breed? Sit down .
24) 2) dialog: Not at all.
24) 4) dialog: I don't. I write crime novels. You must know that.
24) 6) dialog: But sometimes they're adapted for television by other people. You know what the word adapted means, I take it?
24) 8) dialog: Yes. They may not have such a word in Italian.
24) 10) dialog: Oh good. Come and have a look at my special bookcase. ANDREW presses a button on his remote control. A wall moves and turns, revealing a bookcase.
25) 1) dialog: These are all my novels. You've read them, I suppose? MILO. Afraid not.

26) 6) dialog: I think it’'1l do her good to wait five years. Good for her character.
26) 8) dialog: That's the law. The law of the land.
26) 10) dialog: Anyway, we'll come back to it. Perhaps. Have your drink first. ANDREW gives MILO his drink.
26) 11) dialog: What do you do, by the way?
26) 13) dialog: Good God, are you really? I thought Maggie said you were a hairdresser.
26) 15) dialog: You mean another friend?
26) 17) dialog: She tends to have more than one friend.
26) 19) dialog: Oh yes. 11.
26) 21) dialog: She must be lonely.

27) 4) dialog: Take a seat. Make yourself comfortable.
27) 5) dialog: I understand you're fucking my wife.
27) 7) dialog: Right. Yes. Right. So we've cleared that up.
27) 9) dialog: I thought you might have denied it.
27) 11) dialog: Well, she is my wife.
27) 13) dialog: Oh, she's fucking you too? Well I'll be buggered--sorry!
27) 15) dialog: You take turns, do you?
27) 17) dialog: Yes, yes, all right. I follow.
27) 19) dialog: In what? Oh, love. So you're in love?
27) 21) dialog: Let me know top you up. He pours more whisky.
27) 22) dialog: I heard a rumour that you want to marry her. That can't be right, can it?
27) 24) dialog: In this day and age? Is marriage absolutely necessary? Isn't it a bit old hat? 14.
27) 26) dialog: It's a mugs game. I wouldn't go near it if I were you. Anyway you can't marry her. You can't marry her because she's married to me. Unless I divorce her, of course.
27) 28) dialog: Am I what?
27) 30) dialog: To be honest, I can't wait to get rid of her. But I do need to get one or two things straight first. For example, I've never heard of an Italian called Tindle.
27) 32) dialog: Now that's lovely. Like a little bell. I'd go back to Tindolini if I were you. It suits you.
27) 34) dialog: So that if and when you marry Maggie she'd be called Maggie Tindolini. She'd get a real kick out of that. Do you act under the name of Tindle or Tindolini?
27) 36) dialog: Why have I never heard of you? 32 33 34 15.
27) 38) dialog: Really?
27) 40) dialog: That sounds threatening.

30) 2) dialog: And this is her dressing room. He opens a wardrobe.
30) 3) dialog: She's left a few dresses here. Can't even be bothered to pick them up. Worth thousands, thousands. That leather coat alone cost two thousand quid. No, you see, the thing is this--sit down--you see, the thing is this--my wife spends money like water. If you're not careful she'll eat you out of house and home. She was born to luxury. Jamaica, the Ritz, the Swiss Alps. I mean, what are you? You're an out of work actor, a part time chauffeur. You're out of your depth, old boy. You're on a hiding to nothing. You think you're broke now but you'll be ten times broker by the time she's finished with you. She'll have your guts for garters.
30) 5) dialog: Never trust in love, chum. Love'1i kick you up the arse as soon as look at you. Take it from me. First it's love, ten minutes later it's contempt.
30) 7) dialog: Certainly not. Observation. Don't forget I'm a novelist. I observe other people. He goes to the window and looks out. MILO watches him-- silence. 17.
30) 8) dialog: What I'm getting at is this. You won't be able to give her what she wants so she'll leave you and come back to me. But I don't want her near me. She's the last thing I want. I've had her up to here. Anyway, I've got a lovely mistress. She runs a Sauna in Swindon. She's my girl. So you see, I want Maggie to stay with you. I want you two to stay together forever, but unless you listen to me the whole thing will be a fucking disaster with catastrophic consequences all round. But I have a solution.
30) 10) dialog: What are you going to say?
30) 12) dialog: You know what? I'm beginning to respond to your charm.
30) 14) dialog: It's true.
30) 16) dialog: You should be. Tell me something else. I bet you didn't expect me to be so intelligent, so quick witted. Did you?
30) 18) dialog: Maggie told you, did she? 35 36 37
30) 20) dialog: Vodka. He goes to the door. MILO stands, follows.
31) 0) text: The elevator goes down. ANDREW smiles at MILO.
31) 1) dialog: It's a close fit, isn't it, for two?
32) 0) text: The elevator stops. They get out. INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE’ - BAR AREA - NIGHT ANDREW pours drinks.
32) 1) dialog: Listen. I'm going to make you a proposition. A few years ago I gave her some jewels. Amazingly expensive. Well, I didn't give them to her. I own them. They're insured in my name. But I let her wear them- -on special occasions. They're worth half a million pounds. They spend half their time in the bank or in my safe. At the moment they're in the safe in this house. I want you to steal them. Silence.
32) 3) dialog: That's right.
32) 5) dialog: I mean I want you to steal the jewels.
32) 7) dialog: That's right.
32) 9) dialog: It's very simple. Steal them. Sell them abroad. Live happily ever after with Maggie. I'll claim the insurance money--they'1ll have to pay up. I'll have got rid of my wife and I'll be as happy as a pig in shit and you can keep Maggie in the manner to which she has become accustometi. Sounds like a fair bargain to me.
32) 11) dialog: Scummy? I think it's quite elegant.
32) 13) dialog: Real facts.
32) 15) dialog: No it isn't.
32) 17) dialog: A trap? 20.
32) 19) dialog: Well, are you?
32) 21) dialog: Why not?
32) 23) dialog: Correct.
32) 25) dialog: I've already contacted a friend of mine in Amsterdam. He'll give you £400,000 tax free. Think of it. £400,000 tax free.
32) 27) dialog: Because when you steal the jewels you also steal the receipts. So he'll have the title to the jewels as well as the jewels themselves. So when he sells them he'll get the full value. Get it? Think about it. Take your time. Pause.
32) 30) dialog: Listen. Under my crooked exterior I'm a simple honest man. What I've said to you is true. I swear it. I want to get rid of my wife. But I want it to be solid--permanent. I don't want her on my back. I want her to stay on your back.
32) 32) dialog: Frame up? How?
32) 34) dialog: No, no. Tf I shop you you'll shop me. So we'd both end up in jail. No, listen. I take a strictly moral position in all this. My wife is an adulteress. She should actually be stoned to death. But anyway, it's up to you. Make up your own mind.
32) 36) dialog: I don't give a fuck if you trust me or not. This is a very simple proposition. You have an expensive woman and no money. If you want to keep her--steal the jewels.
32) 38) dialog: Don't be silly. The burglary has to look real. The house has to be broken in to.
32) 40) dialog: For Christ's sake. I'm in it. How can I break into it? I live here.
33) 0) text: MILO walks to the window. He looks out. ANDREW watches him.
33) 2) dialog: Why would I agree to the divorce if you're both walking away with £400,000?
33) 4) dialog: Greedy.
33) 6) dialog: Never trust legal justice. You know what legal justice is? It's farting Annie Laurie down a key hole. Listen. £400,000 tax free. All yours. Cash. Why don't you stop pissing about?
33) 8) dialog: Sure I do. All right. I'll be frank. I need it. Cash flow. Stocks and shares going down the drain. Get me? It's quid pro quo. You do me a favour--I do you a favour. And you keep the woman. MILO sips his drink. 23.
33) 10) dialog: What deal?
33) 12) dialog: (slowly) All right. I shake on it. Here's my hand. They shake hands. Silence. -

34) 3) dialog: Get the ladder. By the ladder there's a pair of gardening gloves. Put them on. Also by the ladder there's a hammer. Carry the hammer up the ladder. Break the window with the hammer. Then you reach in and lift the latch.
35) 2) dialog: What?

84) 74) dialog: Humiliation. It's nice to see your wife's lover a shivering, frightened, fucking wreck in front of you. But as a matter of fact I quite liked him. I found him attractive.

84) 106) dialog: There is no body.
85) 2) dialog: I fired two live bullets to set up the trick and one blank to complete it. It was a game. I told you. I played it to the hilt. Not worth playing a game if you don't play it to the hilt. 61.
