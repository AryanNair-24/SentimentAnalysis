23) 10) dialog: You've got to be kidding. As Kelly pulls away from the crowd. Bruce snaps back into “I’m pissed!” mode.
26) 0) text: The Mayor, Jeff and the other Townfolk gather in the town’s small “town hall”, outfitted with benches and a slide projector in the middle of the chairs. As Bruce enters, he makes a point of looking for KELLY. She’s sitting between two FARMERS, but Bruce doesn’t care. He pushes down the crowded row...
26) 6) dialog: What?
26) 9) dialog: Kelly Graham.
26) 11) dialog: (not amused) Ha ha ha.
26) 13) dialog: Why?
26) 15) dialog: I have to go... But as Kelly rises, the Mayor and Jeff motion for her to stay put. They don’t want to rile Bruce back up. (CONTINUED)
26) 35) dialog: I barely know you!
26) 37) dialog: That’s it! You are, without a doubt, the rudest, crudest, most insincere jackass I’ve ever met! As she stands, Bruce also rises, his arm bumping the slide projector and jamming the lens against the hot bulb. As the precious demon image MELTS AND BURNS...
32) 6) dialog: Pretzel?
32) 9) dialog: I own this place.
32) 11) dialog: Want another? Bruce licks at the drink as it spills around his face. (CONTINUED)
32) 15) dialog: We never “got off” at all, and if there’s a God, we never will. (glances toward Jeff) Unfortunately, my son seems to think you’re some kind of hero. Bruce follows her eyes, realizes she’s looking at Jeff.
32) 18) dialog: That’s because Jeff's father left us. Right after Jeff was born.
32) 20) dialog: Maybe it’s all a big joke to you, but Jeff’s talked the whole town into thinking you’re going to save us from this “Guan-Di.”
32) 22) dialog: Far as I can tell, you’re totally full of shit. (CONTINUED)
32) 26) dialog: The what?
35) 5) dialog: I’m sure that’s a first.
35) 10) dialog: Nothing.
35) 12) dialog: Shut up and dance. A Square-Dance band takes position on the floor and the room fills with music. The Square Dance Caller barks out orders to the dancers.

35) 21) dialog: You wanna move that hand? Reveal Bruce’s hand completely inside and up the back of Kelly’s shirt.
36) 0) text: Bruce and Kelly step outside the noisy bar and start down the street. At night the town is actually quite lovely, a throwback to an earlier, more innocent time...
36) 2) dialog: Me too. (eyes on him, wary) And just fresh air. They start down the sidewalk together, the lights from the businesses twinkling in the darkness.
36) 3) dialog: (re: town) Even with everything that’s happened, God I love this place.
36) 5) dialog: Michigan?
36) 7) dialog: Sounds nice.

36) 13) dialog: What was it called?
36) 15) dialog: You’ve come a long way since then.
36) 17) dialog: Believe it or not, Jeff’s shown me a couple. I don’t know about the plots, but you’re usually pretty good in them. Bruce is taken by the compliment.
36) 19) dialog: Wouldn’t say it if I didn’t. Bruce stops and turns to face Kelly. A romantic moment in the offing.
36) 21) dialog: Hey, I came on a little strong myself.
36) 25) dialog: Yes?
36) 27) dialog: You want to move that hand? PULL OUT to reveal Bruce’s hand clamped securely on Kelly’s butt cheek. He jerks it away.
36) 29) dialog: I’ll let it go... this time... Kelly’s already forgiven him. They’re closing for their first KISS when there’s a HARUMMPH off camera. Bruce and Kelly both look over in surprise, seeing EVERYONE FROM THE DANCE in the street, staring at them.
38) 0) text: A convoy of cars and pick-ups tear through downtown Sawville, past the bar, where KELLY watches with worry. Some of the armed-up Townfolk are standing in the back of the pick-ups, waving and firing their guns in rowdy celebration of the battle to come. Suddenly, BRUCE’S TRUCK skids to a stop outside the bar, dust billowing up around it (even though it’s a paved street... what up with that?) Bruce emerges from the wafting dust, practically in Kelly’s arms.
38) 4) dialog: You wanna move that hand? PAN DOWN to reveal Bruce’s hand clamped on Kelly's boob.
38) 7) dialog: My eyes are brown... As the cars careen into the darkness...
45) 10) dialog: Bruce. Where's Jeff?
45) 12) dialog: You just left him out there?
47) 20) dialog: Go back to Hollywood, big shot. Find yourself some hot and cold running starlets. You and I are so over...
47) 26) dialog: Who is this?
47) 33) dialog: (to Bruce, disgusted) My God. You really are a total waste of skin. Torn between Kacey’s demands and Kelly’s disgust, Bruce turns to Kelly.
47) 38) dialog: Jeff asked me to purge his trailer. It was my pleasure. She stuffs a MINDWARP poster into the flames.
47) 40) dialog: Plenty more where that came from. (annoyed) (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
47) 43) dialog: Are you still here? Don’t you have a bad movie to make? Kelly pulls an Ash “Army Of Darkness” action figure from the bed of the pick-up and tosses it into the flames as Bruce winces.
47) 45) dialog: Oh please. She shakes her head derisively as Bruce takes a step closer, just inches away from her.
47) 47) dialog: You wanna move that hand? PULL OUT and REVEAL Bruce’s hand jammed down the back of Kelly’s pants. Bruce pulls out his hand, chagrined.
47) 49) dialog: Jeff needs to be rescued?
47) 51) dialog: 
47) 54) dialog: Oh my God! It’1ll be dark soon. (intense) (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
47) 57) dialog: We need to get the town together, now! As Kelly grabs a cell-phone from her pocket, frantically punching a number, Bruce tries to pluck the smoldering Bruce doll from the flames... INT. KELLY’S BAR - NIGHT A group of grumbling townfolk, several sporting new splints, bandages on their faces, crutches and other medical evidence of Bruce shooting spree have gathered in Kelly’s bar. A rumble of discontent magnifies into open rebellion when BRUCE appears. As if on cue, the entire mob surges forward and grabs Bruce, pinning him against the wall, punching him.
47) 59) dialog: Stop it! Now! The angry ROAR subsides. The crowd, still holding Bruce, turns toward Kelly.
47) 60) dialog: Let him talk. Bruce stares into their faces, all seething with sheer rage, then...
47) 67) dialog: You moved ‘em, all right.
50) 2) dialog: Big ass movie-star. Haven’t you ever heard of a TELEPHONE?! No, YOU had to waste eight hours DRIVING all the way back.
50) 4) dialog: Mano a moron, you mean... Bruce glances through the back cab window, looking at the Bruce Campbell memorabilia scattered in the truck bed. Posters, cardboard standees and even scripts.
50) 6) dialog: Don’t mess around. My demolition supplies are back there. Bruce looks again, noticing a wooden crate that says DYNAMITE.
50) 8) dialog: You don’t? Bruce doesn’t have an answer to that. He fumbles a little more, pulling back with a handful of OLD SCRIPTS.
50) 9) dialog: What are you doing with those? (CONTINUED)
50) 13) dialog: And you think you’re can find it in one of your old scripts?
50) 15) dialog: Gimme a break...
50) 17) dialog: I’ve seen better plots ina Bazooka Joe comic! Bruce sneers at the insult, flipping open a script. He reads a second, then...
50) 19) dialog: Ireland. Miffed, Bruce tosses that script out the window, opens another.
51) 0) text: Kelly suddenly veers off the main road, taking the same dirt road we saw Jeff and Clayton take earlier. As Bruce SLAMS against the side of the truck from the turn...

51) 5) dialog: The signs help. They careen down the dirt road, coming up on the...
52) 0) text: Bruce and Kelly pull up to the old cemetary, a waft of dust rolling over them as they park next to Jeff’s car. Kelly jumps out and looks in Jeff's vehicle, scared when she realizes he’s gone.
52) 1) dialog: Oh my God. He’s gone. (yelling) Jeff! JEFF! No answer. As Kelly gets more concerned.
52) 5) dialog: If he had any sense, he wouldn’t have called you. (yelling)
52) 9) dialog: Jeff! As Kelly runs toward her son, Bruce notices that Jeff's frozen in fear, his eyes wide and staring.
52) 20) dialog: Mr. Wing! He’s right behind you! Wing LAUGHS at Kelly’s concern, pulling a small packet of food from his Chinese robe.
52) 29) dialog: Bruce -- Bruce contemplates his next move, snapping his fingers as he gets an idea.
52) 31) dialog: Bruce, what is it?! Bruce suddenly raises his rifle and aims it, NOT at the Guan-Di but at the tree branches over the Guan-Di’s head.
53) 0) text: Kelly and Jeff are racing through the moonlit woods, around trees and dense foliage, desperate to get away.
53) 1) dialog: Hurry, Jeff, run!
53) 4) dialog: Bruce! What are you doing? As Jeff chokes, unable to break free, Kelly tries to punch Bruce away, but he’s too strong.
53) 5) dialog: For God's sakes, Bruce! Let him go! Desperate, Kelly finds a heavy branch on the ground and swings it like a BASEBALL BAT, smashing it across the back of Bruce’s head. But the limb simply disintegrates into dust as Bruce continues to choke Jeff.
53) 7) dialog: Oh God oh God oh God... (CONTINUED)
54) 0) text: Kelly races to Wing’s decapitated body. Looking for something, she kneels by Wing’s corpse, prying open his dead hand...
55) 0) text: Kelly runs back into the woods. Jeff is faltering, gasping as possessed Bruce continues to choke him. Suddenly, KELLY rushes up to the demonic Bruce and STUFFS a handful of bean-curd into his mouth!
55) 1) dialog: Suck on that, hell-demon! Let him go! Bean curd dribbling from his possessed lips, Bruce releases Jeff, rears back and ROARS toward the Heavens. Spitting curd into the sky. Then, spent, Bruce drops to his knees, head down, gasping. Not willing to take any chances, KELLY finds another thick branch and raises it, preparing for a killing stroke. She hesitates, just for a moment, eyes filling with unexpected tears...
55) 2) dialog: I... I’m sorry... As she swings, Bruce’s hand suddenly SNAPS UP and catches her wrist mid-swing. Bruce’s head is still down, so for an instant we don’t know if this is real or Memorex-Demon Bruce until... HE LOOKS UP. His eyes clear, back to normal. Slowly shaking his head “no” as he stands, savoring Kelly’s relief.
55) 10) dialog: Costume jewelry?
55) 13) dialog: Easy. We can play the blame game later. Question is, what do we do now? Bruce pulls himself together. Looks into the darkness.
56) 0) text: OPEN TIGHT on a smiling, heroic Bruce Campbell face. Slowly PULL BACK to reveal it’s actually a CARDBOARD STANDEE from the CAVEALIEN movie, featuring Bruce in his uniform.

CONTINUE PULLING BACK to reveal Bruce and Kelly rolling demolition wire out away from the standee, toward a Verheiden "My Name Is Bruce" 4/2/06 99.
57) 0) text: Bruce and Kelly bring the wire back to Jeff, waiting with the dynamite plunger.

57) 16) dialog: Bruce, wait! That’s suicide!
57) 21) dialog: Bruce! Wait. (CONTINUED)
57) 24) dialog: You wanna move that hand? Bruce looks down, surprised. PULL BACK to reveal that for once, he’s NOT groping her.
57) 26) dialog: For luck.
59) 1) dialog: Jeff!
59) 5) dialog: I know how much he means to you... how much he means to audiences the world over... but right now, you've got to ask yourself one question. (beat) What would Bruce Campbell do? Jeff thinks a moment, then shrugs and SLAMS DOWN the plunger!
60) 0) text: The cave entrance EXPLODES in a plume of fire and rock. As the explosion settles, dust and smoke billowing, an eerie quiet falls across the scene. KELLY and JEFF slowly move toward the cave entrance. It’s completely sealed by fallen rock. Horrified by what they’ve done, Jeff and Kelly drop to their knees outside the blast area. BRUCE'S SMILING FACE, torn from the shattered standee, grins at them from the dusty boulders.
60) 13) dialog: (Romanian accent) Up yours. PULL BACK to reveal we’re on an EXTERIOR MOVIE SET. A gaffer’s truck nearby reads ROMANIAN LIGHTING SERVICES. As the crew chatter in ROMANIAN, the DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY (the same guy we saw shooting CAVEALIEN) steps into frame.
