8) 17) dialog: I’m aman. And I've been wanting to do this ever since we landed on this rock. As Bruce kisses her, Petra reluctantly, then enthusiastically accepts his kiss. The erotic moment interrupted by a gurgling NOISE off screen.

8) 31) dialog: Hey, Tiny. Fetch me a lemon water, will ya? The P.A. grabs a bottle from a nearby cooler and quickly passes it over. Bruce gives the bottle a glance and tosses it back at the P.A., annoyed.

8) 37) dialog: Easy, Quick-Draw. We’re both on the same page.
8) 39) dialog: Sure, baby. Low budget show like this is just a detour. A quick cash infusion while Scorsese and Spielberg are warming up our chairs.
8) 41) dialog: Sounds like you could use a little filmmaking 101. Lucky for you, the Professor is in. (seductive) I know this little bar off Cahuenga where the drinks are cheap and the barmaids are cheaper... BRRRING. Petra gets a call on her cell. She takes it, cutting Bruce off in mid-sentence.

8) 47) dialog: Jimmy. I’m thinking we should go with a ‘50 for this next shot. D.P. Got one up your ass?
8) 48) dialog: (considers, then) Maybe a ‘75? As Bruce continues to “consider” lens choices, TINY THE ANGRY P.A. is standing to one side, grinning evilly as he pees lemon-green urine into an empty “Lemon Water” bottle. OFF this...
9) 0) text: Bruce, dressed in gaudy civilian clothes as shooting wraps for the day, exits the soundstage, only to find himself suddenly surrounded by a gaggle of devoted FANS. Practically wetting themselves in Bruce’s presence. Geek central. NO GIRLS. Not in the mood for a fan encounter, Bruce forces a wan smile as he wades through them.
9) 2) dialog: Here ya go, one for you, one for you, Holy Mother of God what’s that smell -- As the fan in front of Bruce cluelessly sniffs his own armpits, Bruce reaches in his pocket and hands him a stick of Right Guard. (CONTINUED)

As he slides in and slams the door, the fans continue to assail him with inane questions, one of them even getting in front of the car. Bruce GUNS IT ANYWAY, plowing right into the guy, who shouts his question even as he’s tumbling across the hood...

11) 1) dialog: Gimme a bourbon with a loaded revolver back. Bruce continues into the restaurant itself, spotting MILLS TODDNER sitting alone at a table, talking on his cell-phone and flipping through the trades. As Bruce walks up, he points at the Variety.
11) 2) dialog: Hear I made the trades today.
11) 4) dialog: Yeah. My career’s in the obituaries. Mills closes his phone and rises, laughing at Bruce’s “joke”, giving him a big Hollywood hug and kiss.
11) 7) dialog: I speak English. In their world that makes me Meryl banana-sucking Streep. The Bartender arrives at the table and puts a huge tumbler of bourbon in front of Bruce.

11) 15) dialog: I’m just getting warmed up. And don’t give me that innocent look! I’ve just spent six days of my life making a sequel to one of the worst movies ever made!
11) 17) dialog: The ones I posted! Bruce polishes off his drink, wincing at the burn, as Mills motions for him to sit.
11) 19) dialog: It’s just... I feel like I’m losing my muse. Mills blinks, an “oh God, not this again” expression.

(revving up) ...and I’ve got my fans... my loyal fans... who hated my last movie... hated my last five movies... me and my wonderful, wonderful FANS... As if on unfortunate cue, Bruce hears a “clop THUD clop THUD” as the limping fan he ran down at the studio hobbles toward him.
12) 11) dialog: Lucky friggin’ ME!! WUMP! Bruce throws a punch into the limping fan’s gut. Stunned, the fan drops to his knees, holding out the autographed photo he got earlier from Bruce as... BRUCE’S PINTO pulls up, the Valet screeching it to a halt in a haze of exhaust. The Valet steps out, holding out his hand for a tip, and Bruce plucks the photo from the gasping fan’s hand and passes it to the Valet. (CONTINUED)

14) 9) dialog: Thought I forgot, didn’t you? As “Sammy” starts to drink greedily from the bowl, Bruce idly checks some of the “envelope” mail. Virtually every letter has red ink on it and says something about “FINAL NOTICE” or “THIRD REMINDER.” He tosses the mail and plops down in front of his ancient BLACK AND WHITE TELEVISION, replete with coat-hanger rabbit ears. Using a primitive remote, he switches the set on and gets a static ridden image of an “Entertainment Tonight” type announcer on a studio set. Verheiden "My Name Is Bruce" 4/2/06 23.

15) 11) dialog: They’re making me sound like a has- been! Like I’m all washed up... Desperate for more booze, Bruce notices “SamNRob” still lapping at the bourbon Bruce poured into his bowl. Bruce suddenly drops to his knees and grabs the bowl away from the snarling dog.
15) 12) dialog: They’re making me look pathetic! Bruce tips up the filthy doggie bowl and gulps down the rest of the bourbon, booze spilling down his shirt, enraged at his depiction on the show. OFF this moment... INT. DEBORAH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT Bruce’s ex-wife DEBORAH, 30's and attractive, is rolling over in bed, fumbling sleepily with the phone.

Bruce waits, looking out across the stunned/dull faces of the Townsfolk, momentarily locking eyes with KELLY, 30-ish and pretty. It’s a “love at first sight” moment for Bruce, complete with a slow motion “hair shake” from Kelly. He attempts a suave gesture, despite the “bed head” hairdo from his trunk ride.

As this conversation continues, two more, even TINIER Bruce figures magically appear -- this time on the ANGEL BRUCE’S tiny shoulders! ANGEL BRUCE’S ANGEL (simpering voice) You’re absolutely right, Angel Bruce. Remind him that our fans support us no matter what. ANGEL BRUCE’S DEVIL (gruff voice) What the hell are you talking about? If Campbell takes the dirt nap, we’re all toast! Surprisingly, that last piece of logic hits home with Angel Bruce.

47) 62) dialog: That’s right. It took the faith of a kid like Jeff, and the decency of a good woman like Kelly to help me see the light. In the last twenty four hours, I’ve learned a little something about honor. Respect. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)

He’s struggling to pick himself up when the Guan-Di suddenly looms over him, grabbing him and HURLING BRUCE into Kelly’s pick-up. Bruce’s ass crunches in the windshield, then he rolls off and hits the dirt. As Bruce tries to get up, the Guan-Di’s shadow looms over him again.
