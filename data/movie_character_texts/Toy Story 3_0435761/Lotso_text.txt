23) 55) dialog: Whoa, whoa! Hold on there, Boss! Those Caterpillar kids need someone to play with...!
23) 57) dialog: Oh, none of us do! I agree! Which is why -- for the good of our community -- we ask the newer toys, the stronger ones, to take on the hardships the rest of us can’t bear anymore. Buzz frowns.
23) 60) dialog: Family man, eh? I understand. (sharply) Put him back in the “Time Out” chair. Big Baby grabs Buzz and slams him into the toy chair.
23) 62) dialog: Bring in The Bookworm. 62 Ken whistles. A RUSTLING from a shelf above, where rows o files are cluttered.

But if you break our rules, step outta line, try to check out early? Well... You’re just hurtin’ yourselves. He takes out Woody’s hat, tosses it. It slides across the floor to Jessie’s cubby. The Toys gasp in horror.
29) 7) dialog: Y’all get a good night’s rest! You got a full day of play time tomorrow. Lotso chuckles as he and his cronies drive off. Buzz remains behind, standing guard over the “cell block”. The Toys grasp the bars of their cubbies -- the horrible truth of their situation hitting home.
