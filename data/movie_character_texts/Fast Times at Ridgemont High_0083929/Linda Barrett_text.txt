4) 3) dialog: Did you see his cute little butt? A third waitress enters.
4) 5) dialog: We were!
4) 7) dialog: No, be cool, that's Stacy's section. Through the entrance, we see Stacy Hamilton. She is the fifteen-year-old trainee, sweet-looking with just the last traces of baby fat. She puts down a glass of water for Ron, spills some and mops it up.
4) 9) dialog: How's it going.
4) 13) dialog: Don't you like him?
4) 15) dialog: Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
4) 17) dialog: Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot. She fluffs up Stacy's hair and gently shoves her towards the door. Stacy reluctantly exits.
8) 0) text: It is closed and only a few janitors remain. Stacy and Linda walk through the large empty mall.
8) 2) dialog: (amused) Should we buy a frame for that?
8) 4) dialog: Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
8) 6) dialog: I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
8) 8) dialog: Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
8) 10) dialog: Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
8) 12) dialog: If I didn't have a fiance in Chicago, I'd go for it. A young Girl runs and catches up with Linda and Stacy.
8) 14) dialog: Yes.
8) 17) dialog: Okay, are you over sixteen? The Girl nods.
8) 18) dialog: All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly  - several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
8) 20) dialog: Not if you're over sixteen.
8) 22) dialog: And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either. The Girl thanks Linda again. Linda and Stacy get to the back exit of the mall and Linda uses a key to open the door.
8) 24) dialog: Believe it. They exit the mall, into the night.
18) 1) dialog: I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
18) 3) dialog: God. People exaggerate so much at this school. The school couple, Cindy and Gregg walk by.
18) 5) dialog: Hi, you guys. This is Stacy. Stacy, this is Gregg Adams and Cindy Carr.
18) 7) dialog: If there's one thing that never changes... it's a cheerleader. Stacy turns to see a girl with short, black hair passing by, wearing tight black spandex pants, and dark lipstick.
18) 9) dialog: I know. They watch her pass.
18) 10) dialog: Actually, there are three girls at Ridgemont who have cultivated the Pat Benatar look. Linda gestures out on lunch court.
18) 13) dialog: None of them talk to each other. Linda looks at them with bemusement but Stacy is wondering.
18) 15) dialog: Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them. They sit and eat their lunches. Linda has her perennial diet lunch of yogurt and raw vegetables.
18) 17) dialog: What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
18) 19) dialog: What variables?
18) 21) dialog: What's the big deal?
18) 23) dialog: There's nothing to it. She takes out a carrot stick and eases it down her throat. Stacv tries one but chokes.
18) 24) dialog: You just have to practice a little first.  (feels her throat) Relax these muscles. Think of your throat as an open tunnel. The girls try sliding the carrot sticks down their throats without gagging.
18) 27) dialog: Just kidding. About 10cc.
26) 0) text: Stacy is standing by her locker, twirling the combination. She is joined by Linda Barrett.
26) 1) dialog: Was it great?
26) 3) dialog: You'll always remember your first time.
26) 5) dialog: So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
26) 7) dialog: Hey! That's my line! They both laugh and walk down the hall.
34) 0) text: Linda and Stacy walk past rows of cars. Stacy stops at a brown MG.
34) 2) dialog: Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
34) 4) dialog: Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
34) 6) dialog: Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games. They enter the mall.
37) 0) text: Stacy and Linda are enjoying a brief lull in the Christmas season madness. They sit at the sundae bar. Stacy looks forlorn, almost red-eyed, as she makes a sundae.
37) 1) dialog: You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
37) 3) dialog: I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
37) 5) dialog: Stacy, it doesn't look good for the relationship. Stacy continues making her ice cream, slapping the scoops onto the stainless steel dish.
37) 7) dialog: Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
37) 10) dialog: Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
37) 12) dialog: Hey -- Ron Johnson? It's his loss. We follow Stacy, as she walks into the dining room to serve the sundae.
50) 4) dialog: Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
50) 6) dialog: Just watch out if he pulls up in a van, and then puts on a Led Zeppelin tape.
71) 0) text: The Ridgemont football bleachers are full of cheering students. We see the same basic groups from lunch court, and many more. The cheerleaders are on the field -- Cindy Carr, Dina Phillips and company -- and their cheerleader "husbands" sit directly in front of them in the stands. Linda and Stacy sit in the bleachers with some of the Swenson's girls. The Rat and Damone sit several rows above them, watching. The teachers sit together in another section.
75) 2) dialog: I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
75) 4) dialog: Why don't you put your mother's secret book back? Linda continues regally applying lotion.
75) 6) dialog: (automatic) Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
75) 8) dialog: You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
75) 10) dialog: Climax together.
75) 12) dialog: No. But it's a nice idea.
75) 14) dialog: Well... they obviously don't know about Doug. They laugh. Linda resumes applying the lotion. Stacy continues reading the book. A couple of beats pass.
75) 16) dialog: I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
75) 18) dialog: He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him. Stacy looks at Linda, almost disbelieving.
75) 19) dialog: (wistful) He's no high school boy. There is a noise by the side fence leading into the Hamiltons' backyard. It is Mark Ratner and Mike Damone. They are already wearing swimsuits.
75) 24) dialog: I think they're both virgins. Stacy smiles, gets up and goes over to the fence.
75) 26) dialog: No.
76) 0) text: Mike Damone yells "banzai!" and dives into the small pool. At one end of the pool is the jacuzzi, which is separated by a tile wall. Damone has already poured the Wisk into the jacuzzi, and the detergent has created a huge bubble bath effect. Damone surfaces and flips into the jacuzzi. Stacy, looking great in a green bikini, sits kicking her legs by the side of the pool. Linda stands on the board. She is poised to dive. The Rat treads water and stares at both girls. Inside the Hamilton living room, the family stereo plays the music of Deep Purple's "Woman From Tokyo".
76) 5) dialog: Hi, Brad.
76) 7) dialog: God, he hardly even talks anymore.
76) 15) dialog: who is now sunning herself by the side of the pool. She rubs her legs against each other, slowly, enjoying the hot afternoon.
78) 0) dialog: who smiles at Damone and flips back into the pool with a splash. Damone steals a look down at his swimsuit. He's popped a big one.
78) 2) dialog: Go ahead.
78) 6) dialog: Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
80) 0) text: It features Linda Barrett, just as she stood on the diving board a moment ago. She is gorgeous. Her breasts seem even bigger than usual. Her nipples are hard, poking through the film maroon string bikini. Water rolls slowly down her cheeks, into the corners of her mouth. Her lips are parted slightly. Her eyes are filled with desire as she says...
80) 1) dialog: Hi, Brad. (pause) You know how cute I always thought you were. I think you're so sexy. Will you come to me?
80) 3) dialog: Hey, Brad! Do you have any Q-Ti... The daydream evaporates and we see real life again with an...
81) 3) dialog: Sorry. I didn't know anybody was in here. Linda turns and goes immediately, as if she wants to forget what she saw as quickly as possible. She closes the door behind her.
100) 0) text: It is night, and Linda and Stacy are watching Fantasy Island.
100) 2) dialog: Hello. Linda obviously is disappointed when she hears a female voice.
100) 3) dialog: Yeah... you're kidding... What did he say... What did you say... How much did it cost? Look, tell him he can have a relationship with you or a 'more open' relationship with someone else... Listen, Debbie, can I call you later. I'm waiting for Doug to call. She plops back on the couch with Stacy.
100) 4) dialog: I'll bet he forgets to call again. She notices that Stacy is crying over the TV show.
100) 5) dialog: God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
100) 7) dialog: You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
100) 9) dialog: What do you think it is?
100) 11) dialog: It couldn't be.
100) 13) dialog: Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
100) 15) dialog: But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too. She puts the TV back on and they watch.
100) 17) dialog: What?
100) 19) dialog: You're right. I didn't tell you that.
111) 0) text: Stacy is in Linda's room, sitting on her bed. Her eyes are red and moist from crying. Linda listens to her story.
111) 2) dialog: That little prick.
111) 4) dialog: That little prick.
111) 6) dialog: There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.

122) 0) text: The place is busy again, filled with shoppers and teenagers in summer-type clothing.

Linda Barrett approaches.
122) 2) dialog: Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
122) 4) dialog: What do you want?
122) 6) dialog: Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
125) 4) dialog: He's not coming.
125) 6) dialog: He says he's got to stay in Chicago. (sighs) He says I should visit him sometimes.
125) 8) dialog: Yeah, like maybe never.
125) 10) dialog: Well I might go to Dartmouth.
125) 12) dialog: I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
125) 14) dialog: There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
