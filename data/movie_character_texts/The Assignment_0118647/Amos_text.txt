It is simply an  empty room with a large metal ring embedded into the floo to which Carlos is shackled. Battered and badly bruised,  he's obviously in great pain. The room's metal door SCREE as it opens slowly and a new man whom we will call AMOS  enters. With him are two of the Arabs we've seen earlier. They're bareheaded now, without their kaffiyehs.
18) 1) dialog: (accented English) How do you feel?
18) 4) dialog: You spoke English well enough to  your contact... the street vendor...  so please let's not play games. We're  both professionals, Carlos.
18) 6) dialog: Yes, I know what your name is...  Illich Ramirez...
18) 8) dialog: Alias Carlos Sanchez, alias Carlos  Martinez, alias The Jackal.

18) 14) text: Amos loosens his grasp and straightens up. Carlos winces pain from broken ribs. As he speaks it is now unaccented  English, just the slightest trace of Spanish background.
18) 16) dialog: Amazing how much your English has  improved in just a few seconds...
18) 19) dialog: Remarkable... remarkable  performance... the chutzpa of it is  unbelievable... my hat is off to you  Carlos.
18) 22) text: Amos is doing his best to look unflappable.
18) 23) dialog: Carlos... give me a break, huh? If  you were an American officer you  would have... ID papers, dog tags.
18) 25) dialog: You ditched them.
19) 0) text: Amos walks down the corridor. For the first time, he look the tiniest bit concerned.
20) 0) text: Amos sits in his office looking very worried. A long-hair baby-faced agent comes in. He could pass for a typical st traveling on holiday. His name is YONI.
20) 2) dialog: Yoni... I want you to go back to the  old city... where we caught...  Carlos... I want you to be very  inconspicuous. Take a half dozen  men... you comb every alleyway  there... every garbage can...  everything you can find... for what  looks like a U.S. military ID if  there is such a thing there.
20) 4) dialog: Who said there was a problem? There's  no problem. I just asked you to do  something and you're going to do it.  So there's no problem.

43) 5) dialog: Hello Miguel... My name is Amos.
43) 8) dialog: I hope there are no hard feelings.
43) 12) dialog: Don't let all this equipment fool  you. Carlos still has the home court  advantage. He has the best protection  in the world... three layers at least  at all times. Next and maybe most  important... Carlos himself. The  French DST came to arrest him once.  He was at his apartment, drunk,  playing his guitar. He actually had  them convinced it was all a mistake.  Then he went into his bathroom, took  a shave mind you so he would look  his best for the interrogation and  when he came out managed to shoot  each of them through the forehead.  Then he got the informer who had  betrayed him, put him down on his  knees and killed him... Think of it.  He took a shave and didn't even nick  himself once.
43) 13) text: Amos is quiet, lets that sink in.
43) 14) dialog: Finally, there are political  realities. Whoever hits Carlos has  to realize that he'll unleash against  himself a fanatical wave of terrorist  activity in retribution.

We're going to  make you more terrified than you've  ever been in your life just to see  how you handle the fear. Any other  learning experience you get things  ninety- nine point nine nine nine  percent right you get an "A." Here  if you get things ninety-nine point  nine nine nine percent right... you  get...
44) 5) dialog: I'm not as cold-blooded as my American  friend... it would bother me very  much if you were dead... so we will  teach you to stay alive... but no  questions... just do. Otherwise...
44) 11) dialog: Because Carlos is the master of the  techniques of survival which we will  teach you and because he is an  efficient killer for whoever employs  him, then for him there are simply  no rules. Unlike you Miguel, you're  a rule follower, aren't you?
44) 13) dialog: Carlos is the opposite of that and  that's what's so seductive, you know?  He can kill whomever he chooses...  ravish whoever he chooses... take  whatever he chooses. Do... whatever  he chooses. It is to be in many ways  a superman, not bound by the mores  or morals of humanity.

46) 6) text: There is a silence between them. This is obviously the en of that subject. Then Amos goes on.
46) 7) dialog: Carlos' father abandoned him and his  mother because he wanted to be a  playboy. Your father abandoned you  in effect, when he was sent to prison.  Either way, it's a lonely child  missing his father. I want you to  take what you know of your real father  and superimpose it onto this the  image of Carlos' father, so when you  talk of one you are talking of the  other with the same emotion... the  same love, the same resentment...  the same sadness, the same anger.

54) 17) dialog: His father smoked cigars... the same  ones whose smell you complained about.  The only cover that can save your  life... is the one you believe  yourself. Now... are you ready to  pass the next test?
54) 19) dialog: I'll take that for a yes. You're  about to go into your house. Your  wife has told you she was away with  the children for a week. She is  entering the house for the first  time in a week with you. The children  are still at Grandma's so the two of  you have a nice romantic time ahead  of you. Walk through the house...  through the living room and the  kitchen only. You have thirty seconds.  Walk casually through the house so  as not to make her suspicious of  anything you do and find out if she's  telling you the truth or not. If you  pass this test your questions will  be answered.

You have a right to know certain  things.
84) 6) dialog: But now you love me and we're going  to run away to San Francisco and  find a reformed rabbi to perform a  mixed gay marriage. Listen to me...  You're going to feel more alone than  you've ever felt in your life. It  will hit you all of a sudden and  you'll think your heart's going to  jump out of your chest, you'll think  everyone around you can hear your  heart beating, and that everyone  around you is an enemy agent.

84) 18) dialog: You won't be able to go in with a  gun... too risky... so we're going  to have to get one to you once you're  in place. How I don't know yet...  But we'll get one to you.
