78) 0) text: start TIGHT on a shot of an ashtray. It is overflowing wi cigarettes. A woman's hand picks up the butt that is in t ashtray and with the last of its ember she lights another cigarette off it. She is CARLA, mid-thirties, hard edged  which mars the beauty she still has. She is intense, neur and bitter. She and Ramirez are alone in the living room. She sits in corner. We become aware of the room. It is a study in  contrasts. Light shoots in through shell holes and cracks ruined walls. And yet, the interior is somehow soft, sens with thick carpet, muslin drapes and a large bed that  resembles at one and the same time, a boxing ring and an  altar. She pays no attention to Ramirez. She doesn't even acknowledge that he's entered the room. She is in a kind reverie.
78) 1) dialog: The thing about Carlos is... he  doesn't lose himself with a woman...  not with a lover... maybe with a  whore I don't know... I wasn't his  whore. Lovers are different to him...  he might have a use for them... so  he has to seduce them properly. He  has to make sure they're so crazy  about him they'll do anything for  him.
78) 4) dialog: Shhh! You're not here.
78) 6) dialog: You don't exist until I'm ready to  let you exist, and then... you do  exactly what I say.
78) 8) dialog: It's not pleasure for him... it's...  it's... it's... this sick kind of  conquest... you know this seduction...  he's got to make you not just a lover  but a disciple... a worshipper... He  brainwashes you with his body...  so... so... you'll do anything...  you see because he's the perfect  lover... he does it all to... not to  please you... but to excite you...  to... to make it dangerous for you  and then, that's very sexy too, to a  woman... that danger... like he could  kill you in a second... but instead  he makes you come... So he's almost  killed you, you see? And you have  this orgasm right then and it's like  he's killed you and there isn't  anything left of you and he makes  you be born again the way he wants  you to be. So there isn't a thought  in your brain that he hasn't put  there. Not a feeling in your body  that he hasn't put there.
78) 10) dialog: Take off your clothes.
78) 12) dialog: Look Mister...
78) 14) dialog: I don't want to know your name... I  don't want to know anything about  you okay. This isn't fun for me. I'm  not here to play soft music and be  romantic. I'm here to help you kill  him... At least I hope that's what  you're going to do. They promised me  it was.

78) 50) dialog: He never loses control... He never  tells you how he feels. He's in  control. He's the one who makes you  feel what he wants you to feel. He  never feels anything... You stupid...  stupid...
