1) 143) dialog: And you have a talent for making me feel good about myself.

8) 182) dialog: That’s reassuring.

8) 189) dialog: We have proof that the paintings were Ferdinand’s property, not his wife’s, which makes her will invalid. He looks up and sees them all staring down at him. Toman picked up one piece of paper which he hands to him.
8) 191) dialog: And that’s ignoring the fact that there was a deliberate cover-up to conceal the manner in which the paintings ended up in the Gallery.
8) 194) dialog: It’s not a legally binding will! Maria tries a different tact. She speaks quietly, with gr emotion restrained by dignity.
8) 202) dialog: On the one hand they’re saying ‘take us to court’, on another it’s financially impossible for us to do so.
8) 204) dialog: What about some sort of arbitration? Here, in Vienna.

8) 299) dialog: They’re trying to dismiss the case on procedural grounds.
8) 301) dialog: Staying alive would be an advantage.
8) 303) dialog: Mr. Gould.
8) 305) dialog: Lovely of you to come all the way from Austria Dr. Toman. We’re flattered.
8) 314) dialog: Your Honour, Mr.Gould is right to point out that the FSIA was enacted in 1976 but he is mistaken in his theory that it can not be applied retroactively. He lifts some documents; hands them to a COURT MARSHALL. Court Marshall hands them over to Judge Cooper, who scans them. Meanwhile, Randy passes copies of them to the opposition.
8) 315) dialog: Despite the fact that actions accruing before 1976 are rarer, they very much exist, these are just three examples of them.
8) 320) dialog: Your Honour, I applaud Mr. Gould’s concern for the American tax-payer but taking the defendant to court in Austria would require her to be a multi-milionairess. It is not an option. In a matter of fact your Honour, we have exhausted all other options. If we hadn’t we wouldn't be standing before you today. 88 INT. COURTROOM, THE DISTRICT COURT. DAY. And JUDGE COOPER gives her verdict from the bench.
8) 325) dialog: First hurdle down.
8) 327) dialog: Dr. Toman.
8) 329) dialog: You’re a busy man who can’t be that keen on spending the good part of his life traipsing through the U.S. Court system. I would urge you to consider mediation.
8) 336) dialog: Okay, that’s fine, so I’ll see you at the airport. And he switches it off. She’s picked up that he’s trouble something.
8) 338) dialog: I chickened out. I don’t have the heart to tell her.
8) 340) dialog: Our own Government has filed a brief in Austria’s favour. Can you believe that?
8) 342) dialog: The Iraq war.
8) 344) dialog: They don’t want to start antagonising their allies.
8) 346) dialog: Feels like I’m fighting the whole damn world. And Pam looks at him. Something in her can’t help admirin him. And that same thing starts to change her. She doesn’ want to be one of the people he’s fighting anymore.
8) 363) dialog: Your Honours, this repeated attempt by the defence to have the case dismissed.. Pam appears at the door in her nightie. Considering what she’s about to say, her attitude is quite relaxed.
8) 365) dialog: You think I should go deeper with the voice?
8) 367) dialog: Okay. Stay calm, stay calm. But she is calm, he’s the one freaking out as he hurriedl dresses. Pam calmly takes an overnight bag out, places it the bed, and starts putting clothes into it.
8) 369) dialog: You’re having a baby.
8) 371) dialog: I‘1l get the car. Do you need to sit? Do you need a glass of water?
8) 374) dialog: Are you sure that’s important right now? She chucks him a slightly old-fashioned green one.
8) 377) dialog: Are you sure that’s what you want?
8) 380) dialog: We need to go. I’m not good at the whole midwife thing. EXT. WASHINGTON. DAY. Washington in the winter sun: Capitol Hill, the White Hou The Supreme Court. INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL. DAY. Maria is sitting on the edge of the bed coaching Randy wh stands before her.
8) 382) dialog: Mr Chief Justice and may it please the Court..
8) 384) dialog: This is great for my confidence.
8) 386) dialog: Maria, this really isn’t helping. I need to go through the briefs.
8) 389) dialog: Will I? And his question hovers in the air. Suddenly, they’re bot aware that they might be well out of their depth. EXT. THE SUPREME COURT. DAY. In the morning sunshine, the Supreme Court stands proud. INT. THE SUPREME COURT. DAY. And in the Court, everybody is settling down for the sess to begin. Randy on the one side with Maria, Gould, Toman FRANKS (representing the US Government) on the other. Mar leans over to Randy again, offers him a cough-sweet.
8) 412) dialog: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: We believe that applying the FSIA is not impermissibly retroactive. Chief Justice Rehnquist starts to ask him a question. Ran is like a bunny in the headlights of a car.
8) 414) dialog: I’m sorry. I didn’t understand the question. The embarrassment is palpable. Maria looks at the floor. Toman can’t help but let out a little smirk.
8) 416) dialog: We're very sensitive to the Government’s concerns, Mr Chief Justice, the can of worms argument. But each country is different and poses different conditions. Unlike say Cuba, in Austria’s case there's a treaty so there’s no dispute as to what type of law could apply. We recommend opening the can but extracting our one little worm with a pair of tweezers. And then closing it shut again. And laughter from the audience.
8) 417) dialog: The defendants have continuously tried to frustrate our attempts, raising every possible objection and threatening an Armageddon in international relations. (MORE)
8) 418) text: But let’s put things into perspective here: this is a case about one woman wanting back what is rightfully hers. Mrs. Altmann came to America as a young woman in search of peace. Let’s give her justice too. Maria looks up at Randy and her eyes are beaming with pri INT. AN ANTEROOM, THE SUPREME COURT. DAY. In a room just outside the courtroom, Maria and Randy fin themselves in the middle of a media scrum. A REPORTER pla a mike under Maria.
8) 422) dialog: Why, thank you. Randy Schoenberg. He gives him his card.
8) 424) dialog: Okay.
8) 426) dialog: Well, thank you very much. That’s a cheerful way to end the day.
8) 429) dialog: Hi Nathan. And he is overwhelmed. EXT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN. DAY. Superimposed caption: THREE MONTHS LATER. Maria, Pam and Randy are sitting on the lawn - Pam is hol Nathan in her arms while Dora runs laughing around Maria. Dora is looking older than when we last saw her, she’s a toddler.
8) 431) dialog: Are you calling me hyper-active?
8) 435) dialog: They said we should hear by noon. The phone rings. Randy runs indoors to answer it. Maria a Pam look at each other and smile at the speed with which run into the house. INT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ KITCHEN. DAY. He answers the phone. Through the window we can see Pam a Maria playing with the kids, though obviously on tenterho themselves.
8) 436) dialog: Hello? EXT. THE SCHOENBERGS’ GARDEN. DAY. 100 Randy comes out, walks up to where Maria and Pam are sitt He looks downcast, as if the news is bad.
8) 438) dialog: Bad news I’m afraid. You can’t give up yet. The fight goes on.
8) 440) dialog: The Supreme Court has ruled in our favour. We can take the Austrians to trial, Maria. Pam jumps up and hugs him.
8) 444) dialog: Just something I've been thinking over that kind of puts a damper on the celebrations. She looks at him, not understanding.
8) 445) dialog: Sure, we can take them to court. But they’1l find other ways to stretch it out. Could take a few more years. She might not live to see the outcome. (MORE)
8) 447) dialog: And we can’t afford it. Four more months and the bailiff’s at the door.
8) 449) dialog: There’s only one more thing we could try. And then, Pam too, well-versed in the case, gets it.
8) 452) dialog: Funny how things turn out in the end.
8) 457) dialog: Despite my protestations, my client is prepared to meet you half way.
8) 459) dialog: And then come to an agreement with us on the question of compensation.
8) 462) dialog: Arbitration in Vienna.
8) 464) dialog: We chose one of the arbitrators, you choose another. The third is neutral. Toman can hardly believe his ears and has trouble conceal his joy.
8) 468) dialog: I want to see you getting your paintings back Maria. I'd like you to get them before.. 103
8) 470) dialog: Well, frankly, yes.
8) 472) dialog: I honestly don’t think we have a choice.
8) 474) dialog: Maria. Listen to me. I can’t sit here arguing with you, okay? I’m doing what I think is best. You need to just be quiet for once, and trust me.
8) 477) dialog: Nice one, Maria. Thank you.
8) 479) dialog: The feeling is mutual but we don’t have the choice right now. She tries to close the door, he puts his foot in it and blocks it. INT. MARIA’S HALLWAY. DAY. Exasperated, Maria opens the door, walks into the hallway Randy follows her into the house. She turns on him. And w she speaks it is with a quiet steel in her voice. She’s m her mind up.
8) 481) dialog: What’s over? What are you saying?
8) 483) dialog: Are you insane?
8) 485) dialog: Are you kidding me? I have given everything I have! I am HALF A MILLION DOLLARS in debt and my wife and I are..my children, everything I fucking care about in this world....and you have the nerve..everything I’ve done I’ve done to get those goddamn paintings back for you...I wish you’d never asked me.. and you have the nerve to come to me and say that it’s all over! And he stops and Maria is standing there, looking at him, shaken by his rage. And, softening, he speaks quietly. 105
8) 486) dialog: We've come so far...just hang in there.
8) 489) dialog: Here’s hoping.
8) 491) dialog: Two tickets, please.
8) 495) dialog: I have, yes.
8) 497) dialog: Thank you sir. Randy stands in the centre of the room and it feels like whole of Austria is his audience. He clears his throat, t a deep breath but looks uncertain - almost as if he can’t it. He begins but his tone lacks confidence, it wavers.
8) 498) dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, I’m happy to be standing before you today for two reasons. Firstly, like my opponents in this case I always believed that this was a domestic matter for Austria that needed to be decided within her borders. Suddenly he’s interrupted: a door opens at the back of th room. His eyes are drawn to it. It’s Maria. She’s come af all. She walks up to the front of the room and sits. Rand comes to her, leans in, and they whisper to each other.
8) 499) dialog: I wasn't expecting to see you here. 107
8) 501) dialog: And the second reason I’m happy to be in Vienna today is because my client Mrs. Altmann and I are both Austrians. Some of the audience seem surprised but Maria knows what means.
8) 502) dialog: Oh, don’t get me wrong, we’re very much Americans too. But our families and the roots we share are situated in the culture of this very city. INT. CONCERT HALL, VIENNA. NIGHT. And we see a flashback to the night before and Randy observing the audience as they listen to his grandfather' music INT. KLIMT’S STUDIO. DAY. And now we see Adele being painted by Klimt once more, as puts the final touches to the great painting.
8) 503) dialog: And somewhere, in the heart of this world, stands the woman whose portrait both sides are fighting for. Adele Bloch-Bauer. INT. THE ARBITRATION ROOM. DAY. Randy in full flow now, the confident, experienced lawyer has become.
8) 504) dialog: During my visits to this country I have discerned that there are two Austrias: the one that opposes restitution to the victims of Nazism, and another that recognises the injustice committed against Austria’s Jewish population and seeks to rectify it. We watch Dr Toman, Elizabeth Gehrer and Rudolf Wran responding to what he is saying and then we land on Huber the two Austrias. 108
8) 505) dialog: As I hope I demonstrate in my written arguments, the law favours restitution. And now, during these next few scenes we watch a flashing montage of the journey of the painting and the way it end up in the Belvedere -- EXT. VIENNA. DAY. The Anchluss: The Viennese crowds greet the Nazis in celebration, women throwing flowers to welcome them.
8) 506) dialog: A string of events and misdeeds point to the incontestible fact that the paintings in question reached the Belvedere Gallery and remained there for over half a century in a manner that was both dishonest and illegal. And that Adele’s will itself was not legally binding. INT. LIVING ROOM ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY. The auction at Elizabethstrasse. EXT. ELIZABETHSTRASSE. DAY. The painting of Adele being loaded onto a truck. INT. THE BELVEDERE. DAY. And the painting coming to hang on the wall of the Belved under Grimshitz’s supervision. INT. THE ARBITRATION ROOM. DAY. And as Randy reaches the conclusion he slows his tempo a little to make sure these last few words really land.
8) 507) dialog: In its own way Ladies and Gentlemen this is a moment of history, a moment in which the past is asking something of the present. Many years ago, (in this very city,) just beyond these walls, terrible things happened. People dehumanised other people - they persecuted them, sent many to their deaths, and decimated whole families breaking them apart forever. And they stole from them - properties, livelihoods and the objects that were most precious to them. (MORE )
8) 509) dialog: Amongst those people were the Bloch- Bauers, the family of a very dear friend of mine. So now I am asking you - as Austrians - as human beings - to recognise that wrong. (Not just for Maria Altmann but for Austria.) I am asking you today to look at the past, as I have, and to restore what has been taken away. And his eyes meet Maria’s. And by articulating these last words, he understands that he too, in some profound way, been restored. And it is clear that his words have resona with his audience, especially on the faces of Toman and W EXT. THE PRATER PARK. DAY. Maria, Randy and Hubertus are walking in the shade of the Ferris Wheel. Randy is checking his phone.
8) 510) dialog: They said they should announce the verdict by four.
8) 516) dialog: It’s pretty damn good. Randy smiles guiltily at the memory of his initial scepti of Hubertus. Maria leans over and takes Hubertus’ hand.
8) 518) dialog: Decision time. INT. THE ARBITRATION ROOM. DAY. The room is packed to the rafters. A tense atmosphere - t moment everyone has been waiting for. Maria, Randy and Hubertus are squeezed in and nearby are Wran, Toman and Gehrer. There is also a large media contingent. The main arbitrator stands and there is a hushed silence.
8) 522) dialog: The press are waiting outside Maria. They want a statement. How do I look?
8) 524) dialog: Sexy and victorious! Suddenly, out of nowhere Toman approaches Maria.
8) 530) dialog: Have I said that we couldn’t have done it without you? INT. ROOM OFF THE ARBITRATION HALL. DAY. Maria has found and entered an empty room off the hall an closes the door behind her. There is a window and she wal towards it. She suddenly looks quite frail, takes a few d breaths. She is overwhelmed. And then, she remembers the time she saw her parents. The goodbye -- INT. GUSTAV AND THRESE’S BEDROOM. DAY. 1938 Maria moves into the room and joins Gustav and Therese by bed. She kneels down, takes their hands in hers and the t of them hold on to each other, knowing this may well be t last time they ever see each other. Therese is crying. Wh Gustav speaks it is with some effort, his breathing is laboured.
8) 541) dialog: Maria?
8) 543) dialog: Are you alright? He approaches her. Fighting a huge surge of emotion, she tries to express herself.
8) 546) dialog: So now..
8) 548) dialog: You can move house, Maria, buy anything you want.
8) 550) dialog: What about you?
8) 556) dialog: I didn’t do it on my own. And then, a few seconds later, Randy looks up. They are outside the Elizabethstrasse house. Maria is visibly move And on the spur of the moment, she makes a decision.
