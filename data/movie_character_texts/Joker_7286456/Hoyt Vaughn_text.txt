A giant ashtray filled with cigarette butts. A cale of booking hangs on the wall. A scribbled, jumbled mess.
15) 2) dialog: (without even looking up)
15) 6) dialog: Right. Joker goes to sit down-- HOYT
15) 7) text: Don't sit. This will be quick. Joker stops in his tracks. HOYT
15) 8) text: Look, I like you, Arthur. A lot of the guys here, they think you're a freak. But I like you. I don't even know why I like you. I mean, you don't say much. (beat) It's probably that stupid laugh. It gets me every time. Kills me. Unsure how to respond, Joker just nods. HOYT
15) 9) text: But I got another complaint. And it's starting to piss me off. Joker takes a deep breath, maybe picks at his eyebrow. HOYT
15) 11) text: No. I got jumped. I told you about that. HOYT
15) 13) dialog: (taken aback) Hey! BANG! BANG! He does it two more times. Breaking the plast on the wall--
15) 15) dialog: What the fuck, Arthur?!
15) 17) text: I don't have his sign.                                    And Joker just stares at Hoyt, some blood forming on his forehead--
36) 2) text: Hoyt, let me explain.
36) 3) dialog: Oh, this'll be good. Please tell me why you brought a gun into a sick kid's ward?
36) 8) text: (into phone) Randall told you that? HOYT (OVER PHONE)
36) 10) text: (into phone) Hoyt-- HOYT (OVER PHONE)
36) 12) text: (into phone) Say what? HOYT (OVER PHONE)
36) 14) text: (into phone; low) --I'm a fuck up and I'm fired. HOYT (OVER PHONE)
36) 16) text: (into phone; louder) I'm a fuck up and I'm fired. HOYT (OVER PHONE)
36) 17) text: Yes. You are. Click. He hears Hoyt hang up. Beat.
90) 17) text: (snaps at Gary)                                     That's because the suspect was a                        regular-sized person. If it was a                       fucking midget you'd be in jail                         right now.                                              (turns back to Joker)                               Anyway, Hoyt said they were looking                     for me, and, and I just wanna see                       what you said. You know, make sure                      our stories line up, bein' that                         you're my boy and--                                     AND JOKER STABS THE SCISSORS AS DEEP AS HE CAN into Randa neck. Blood spurts. Randall screams. Gary stumbles back i shock-- GARY
