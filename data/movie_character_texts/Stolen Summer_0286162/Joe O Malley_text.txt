22) 1) dialog: Danny's a good kid, huh?
22) 2) text: Yeah. His medicine makes him bald. But it doesn't hurt. I'm gonna convert him. Joe shakes his head.
22) 3) dialog: Leave him alone.
22) 5) dialog: But his parents don't. Look, he's Jewish. His family's Jewish. If they wanted to be Christian, his parents would change.
22) 7) dialog: The quest has been called off.
22) 9) dialog: Well, I'm breaking that promise. You can't go converting Jewish kids the same way they don't go converting you.
22) 11) dialog: I said no. No more lip from you. Do not go to that synagogue and do not bother Danny or his family anymore. Do you understand me? Pete doesn't answer.

37) 34) dialog: There's no need, Rabbi. And that's the end of that.
37) 36) dialog: That's OK.
37) 45) dialog: Rabbi Jacobsen, that is an extremely kind offer, but one that we cannot accept. Patrick looks at Joe and tears form in his eyes.
37) 47) dialog: Other men risked their lives that day and every other day.
37) 49) dialog: You spoke to my boss?
37) 51) dialog: I imagine they want to give it to him in a big ceremony?

37) 74) dialog: (To Margaret) He disobeyed my word. (To Pete) The right thing? You're not even eight. You don't know what the right thing is. You know what I tell you, and what your mother tells you. Jewish people believe in their own thing. They do not go to heaven. And neither do Christians who disobey their fathers. Now get upstairs. Now! Pete walks up the stairs. Joe walks into the kitchen and grabs a beer. Patrick follows him.
37) 76) dialog: Over my dead body. Do you understand it's not about you? It's not about kindness. It's about good publicity. The Jews help out a poor Irish Catholic family and they get on the news and the people think, how nice is it that the Jews share their money.
37) 78) dialog: Too proud? Maybe a little pride wouldn't hurt you. Instead of sitting there with your hand out, maybe if you took pride in a little hard work, you'd understand.

38) 8) dialog: Cause they need discipline.
38) 10) dialog: That's a bunch of crap. You think I bounced things off my dad? Hell no.
38) 12) dialog: Yeah, he was an asshole, but I respected him. And looking back, he did a great job.
38) 14) dialog: That's bullshit.
38) 16) dialog: That's not...
38) 18) dialog: How do you know what college is about?

45) 7) dialog: I saw Rabbi Jacobsen last night. I guess Danny's back in the hospital.
45) 9) dialog: It's tough. What he's got. It's tough on a kid. And the family.
45) 11) dialog: That would be nice.
45) 13) dialog: Pete? Pete pops his head back in.

47) 19) dialog: I looked around for the cameraman. I couldn't find him.
47) 21) dialog: Thank you.

48) 44) dialog: So God's probably Jewish too.
48) 48) dialog: Of course he wouldn't. Just like I wouldn't turn my back on you or any of your brothers or sisters. Dads take care of their family.
48) 50) dialog: I'm saying, maybe Danny is in heaven. Even though he's Jewish. I'm saying maybe when they say the kingdom of heaven can only be reached through Jesus, maybe what they really mean is heaven can be reached through being a good person just like Jesus. An Eskimo at the North Pole, who never heard of Jesus, who's been a good person all his life, shouldn't he be allowed into heaven?
48) 52) dialog: But what?
48) 54) dialog: You're not going to get out of Catholic school that easily. You still have to listen to them.
