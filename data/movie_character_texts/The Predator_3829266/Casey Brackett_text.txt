15) 3) dialog: (to unseen dog) Teddy! Knock it off, you can see she doesn’t like that! The jogger, persistent. Extends his hand:

15) 11) dialog: More like -- survival of the fittest.
15) 13) dialog: You mean science? Yeah. Yes, I do. (beat) It’s funny, Darwin thought it was about strength, agility, intelligence... These days, you just have to be a rich, fat white guy.
15) 15) dialog: Drop a CEO into the Serengeti. Only question -- what color animal shits him out. My vote? Reddish-tan. The Jogger: Gulp. He nods slowly.
15) 18) dialog: Please.
15) 20) dialog: “Professor,” mostly.

16) 1) dialog: Hey, they don’t judge you, they don’t lie. People have hidden agendas. Animals just love you, or-- tear your throat out. I kinda have to respect that. Church hands her a file folder.
16) 3) dialog: I wasn’t aware there were any. As she opens the file, he shines a pen light to illuminate the TOP SHEET:

23) 6) dialog: I wrote a letter when I was six. Said I loved animals and... if NASA ever found a space animal, they should call me. (beat) Couple years ago, they put me ona short list because of a paper I wrote on hybrid strains. A computer had cross-referenced my letter.
24) 0) text: White. Sterile. Casey and Colwell enter through an airlock hatch. It SEALS SHUT with a HISS, air-tight.
24) 2) dialog: (to VOICE) You’re not gonna buy me a drink first? She and Colwell start to strip, separated by a partition.
25) 2) dialog: Two, actually. She nods to the dormant Predator. CASEY (CONT’D) Why do you call it “the Predator”?
25) 4) dialog: That’s a hunter.
25) 6) dialog: That’s a hunter. Not a predator. Predators kill for food, to survive. There’s only one animal on earth that hunts for sport. Traeger tries not to roll his eyes; “liberal.” Casey paces beside the Predator. Regards its mandibled features with something akin to wonder. Whispers:
25) 7) dialog: (CONT’D) You... are one beautiful motherfucker.
25) 9) dialog: Is this a joke?
25) 11) dialog: -- human DNA. She looks at them, baffled. How is that possible?

Traeger nods to the med tech. The file is quickly produce and Casey FLIPS to the blurry photo of the Predator. Poin CASEY (CONT’D) In this photo, it’s wearing some kind of... atmosphere mask, a biohelmet.
28) 3) dialog: And look at the wrist computer. Something’s missing. Sure enough, the Predator’s wrist computer is OPEN -- an empty slot where the KUJHAD should be. She looks at Traeg CASEY (CONT’D) Where are they? Traeger and Colwell trade uneasy glances. After a beat, Casey re-opens the file. FLIPS to the photo of... MCKENNA CASEY (CONT’D) Is this the man who made first contact? (Colwell nods) I’d like to talk to him.
28) 5) dialog: Well, if you’re going to lobotomize him, can I ask him some questions first?

42) 1) dialog: Wait a minute. (re: centrifuge) If this is blood -- (re: vial) -- then what’s that? Traeger looks vaguely discomfited. But before he can answer, a LACKEY approaches.
46) 2) dialog: Look, I know I’m new, but -- it’d be swell if somebody would kinda sorta, I dunno... tell me what the fuck is going on here? Traeger answers without missing a beat.
46) 5) dialog: Your point -- ?
46) 8) dialog: Excuse me?
46) 10) dialog: I’m sorry. It took four--?
46) 12) dialog: So -- a meth head can take down four men. (re: Predator) Look at it! Traeger looks uneasy.
46) 14) dialog: My point is you brought it here. To a location where you just happen to store its weapons -- (beat) How do you know it didn’t WANT
46) 17) text: That’s when ALARM KLAXONS peal throughout the complex. CASEY (CONT’D) What’s happening? TRAEGER’S AIDE clutches a phone receiver. YELLS:

Trembling, breathless, Casey LEVELS THE WEAPON. Pulls the trigger: a dry CLICK--! Jammed. The Predator cocks its head at her. Is it... smiling? And then -- it simply MOVES PAST her. SPARING HER. As Casey breathes in short terrified bursts, we --
55) 0) text: Casey finishes pulling on her clothes, notices -- on the floor, splatters of phosphorescent GREEN BLOOD. She looks back into the lab -- at the tranq gun CARTRIDGE on the rack. Then... something arguably more important: The mysterious SPECIMEN VIAL she saw earlier.
60) 0) text: Dressed and clutching the tranq rifle, Casey follows a tr of Predator blood to THE STILL-OPEN VAULT -- immediately it’s been ransacked. What the hell was it looking for? A bleeding MED-TECH stumbles around the corner, sees her:
60) 2) dialog: It won't. (nods grimly) Not my space animal. She turns -- sprints out of frame, and meanwhile

SCOOPS HER UP -- And here come THE LOONIES; Williams in the lead! A phalan of crazy-ass Hell’s Angels. The recovering mercs OPEN FIRE -- as the cycles BLAST FORWARD, out of the compound, as we CUT TO:

79) 14) dialog: I love waking to the sound of macho bullshit. She grimaces. Fumbles out her CELL PHONE -- Incredibly, McKenna GRABS the shotgun, COCKS IT: Is he gonna shoot he No. He GRABS THE PHONE, shoves it under a pillow, and -- muted BOOM--! The pillow’s a smoking ruin. PHONE, vanquis CASEY (CONT’D) (stunned disbelief) Are you crazy--? A beat. Then a SMALL CHORUS:
79) 19) dialog: You guys can play house if you want, I have dogs to feed and midterms to grade --
79) 21) dialog: Expendables, huh? More like the Seven fucking Dwarfs. Nettles grins bashfully -- Casey sighs. CASEY (CONT’D) Can I borrow a phone, at least? I need someone to feed my dogs. She flops in a chair. Gazes up at McKenna. CASEY (CONT’D) You saw it first, didn’t you? The Predator? (off his quizzical look) I read the file. Those men it killed -- yours? 53. McKenna nods, grim. McKenna’s CASEY (CONT’D) I figured. You may as well have written their script. Psycho ex- sniper. PTSD, divorced... even got a flaky kid who curls up ina ball, it’s perfect -- eyes blaze. She shrugs: CASEY (CONT’D) I’m just telling you what’s in the file.
79) 23) dialog: That was an unfortunate embellishment. Can we move on?
79) 25) dialog: I’m an evolutionary biologist. I was on call in case of... you know, contact. McKenna thinks it over, paces. Stops, exhales raggedly...
79) 27) dialog: The Predator? Well... (shrugs) It has human DNA, for one thing. The loonies react. WHAT? 54. CASEY (CONT’D) That’s not all. I was there when it escaped, it... I think it was looking for something. McKenna goes pale with realization.
79) 30) dialog: “Ordnance”?
86) 1) dialog: It’s like a supermatrix of tryhydroxy and amino acids... She pulls back from the lens. Blinks, incredulous: CASEY (CONT’D) With evidence of recombinant gene splicing.
86) 3) dialog: If I’m right..? It means they’re trying to upgrade themselves. She picks up a TALKIE, keys it: CASEY (CONT’D) McKenna? I’ve found something. EXT.

112) 1) dialog: Nice kid. McKenna nods thanks. Sits. CASEY (CONT’D) You know... a lot of experts think being on the spectrum’s not a disorder. Some think it might even be the next evolutionary step.
112) 3) dialog: It’s the same love. Just deflected. (cautiously If I can offer an opinion... maybe you're a little bit afraid of each other? He shakes his head, rueful.
114) 2) dialog: Maybe sensory receptors. Like... cat whiskers.
114) 4) dialog: Just this. -- and produces THE VIAL she stole from the lab. CASEY (CONT’D) They extracted this from the Predator’s spinal fluid. In layman’s terms, it’s like distilled “lizard brain.” The part that kicks in under extreme survival conditions.
114) 6) dialog: Remember I told you they rip out peoples’ spines?
114) 8) dialog: Right. But if a Predator’s first and foremost a survivor-- (beat) Wouldn’t it make sense to collect DNA “souvenirs”?
114) 10) dialog: Brain stem -- close enough. Look suppose, just suppose, that these space creatures are... siphoning off our lizard brain juice.
114) 15) dialog: (interrupting) Why stop there? Seriously -- why not other species, too? (beat) Extreme hybridization. That’s why they hunt. To extract the defense mechanisms from the strongest, the smartest, the most dangerous species on every planet they visit...
114) 17) dialog: This new Predator, the bigger one -- it didn’t need a mask, you notice that? And did you see its fucking eyes? (beat) They’ re evolving, Lieutenant. Changing.
114) 19) dialog: And here’s the clincher. (leans in) Project Stargazer? The shit- show that recruited me? Mckenna shrugs: What about it? CASEY (CONT’D) A stargazer’s a type of flower; an orchid. And not just any orchid --
114) 21) dialog: That thing back there... the new one, “Thing Two”? Probably top of the line. “Thing One”? Last year’s model. (re: the sniffer) Old Yeller out there’s another kind. But none of them is the essential Predator. You know why? Because survival is. Because this -- She holds up the vial, locks eyes with McKenna. CASEY (CONT’D) This is the Predator.

117) 4) dialog: What are you saying, we’re Twinkies?
117) 6) dialog: Jesus. We’re an endangered species, and they know it. That’s why they keep coming here -- they want to snap up our best DNA before it goes bye-bye.
117) 9) dialog: What about their own planet?
117) 12) text: Casey shudders.
117) 13) dialog: And your angle -- the upgrade tech, am I right?

Casey throws up a little in her mouth as she hears FOOTFA SEES McKENNA, WILLIAMS, CUTTER (in his wheelchair) come around a corner, armed to the teeth.
124) 2) dialog: See this? THIS is why the army thinks you’re crazy! Except... a SOUND now. A low pulse; BASS VIBRATO from outside. MCKENNA peers through the crack again... and his eyes widen. An involuntarily gasp.

158) 1) dialog: (into Bluetooth; sheepish) Um..? She makes a face at Rory; “BUS-TED.”
158) 5) dialog: There was something about self- destruct in the file. The one Schaefer met in ‘87 left a pretty big hole.
158) 8) dialog: He’s on it, McKenna.
