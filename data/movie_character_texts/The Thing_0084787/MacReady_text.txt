Palmer awkwardly spins in circles, swinging the  Doctor's body like a propeller blade, struggling to keep balance, as he advances on MacReady. The second orifice,  spitting and snarling as it continues to take form. MacReady waits until Palmer's back spins around, facing h Only two yards away, MacReady flings his lit roll into th ever-evolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch cover Childs and Garry with his body.
