Stunned, MacReady manages to elude it, diving fo the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite. MacReady lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from table. Palmer awkwardly spins in circles, swinging the  Doctor's body like a propeller blade, struggling to keep balance, as he advances on MacReady. The second orifice,  spitting and snarling as it continues to take form.

A slight scratch at the door. Garry's hand tightens around the generator switches The scratching gets more pronounced. MacReady cautions Ga with a whisper.
167) 8) text: The door begins to pound from the outside. Nauls and MacR light two cocktails each. The door booms. The room's foundations shake. The ceiling quivers. The gas bombs are cocked. From the roof The Thing roars down into their midst. Stunned, the men stumble back. MacReady throws his gas bo Nauls the same. For a moment it stands silhouetted in flame. Enormous. Grotesque. Garry bolts for the main door. The Thing's tongue spirals from his mouth and spears him. The good two-thirds of its body follows its tongue and engulfs Garry by the door. Another leg slaps Nauls to the ground. MacReady dodges st another appendage, dives on the generators and throws the switch. The current rips through the door. Garry dies instantly. One of The Thing's talons, still caught in the door, send it writhing in pain. It literally rips the door from its  latchings and pounds it to the ground, trying to shake it loose. Nauls, hobbles, scrambles, out of the opening. MacReady dives through the window and out into the storm.
