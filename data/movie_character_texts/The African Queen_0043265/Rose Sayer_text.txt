1) 4) dialog: early thirties, tight-featured and tight-haired, very hot but sweating less than Brother. She is pumping the pedals vigorously, spreading with her  knees the wings of wood which control the loudness, utili various stops for expressiveness of special phrases, and  rather desperately studying the open hymnal, just managin to play the right notes -- a very busy woman. She, too, i singing her best and loudest, an innocent, arid, reedy  soprano; and she, too, is very attentive to the meanings words: "Hold me with Thy powerful hand."
1) 10) dialog: completes "Thy Powerful Hand"; o.s. Voices of singers.  Unperturbed, Rose finishes her casual disposal of the bug and pulls out a new stop.
1) 11) text: Through rest of hymn, SHOOT and CUT against its lines for meaning, irony and pathos, roughly as follows: FULL VIEW of congregation past Brother and Rose. They are all Negroes and nearly all are dressed in glaring white - the women in garments like camisoles, the men in pants wh reach about to their shins: splayed, bare feet. Some of t faces bear the marks of heavy savage ornaments which have been removed, or of tatooing and scarring rituals which h been outlived -- torn nostrils, lips and ear lobes, a nec curiously thin and weak from the enormously heavy metal b which used to surround it. Some of the children are naked near-naked. Nearly everybody dutifully shares open hymnal but it is obvious that few, if any, can read. The singing most of them is weirdly shy and inchoate -- a little like that of a neighborhood audience when a group "sing" is im upon them. But on certain high phrases a glad, rich, wet  soprano lifts out large and happy, very child-like; and a big male voice bleats forth joyous, jazz-like improvement on the tune, a little off-key. There are very few men pre We detail or bring into salience, bare feet slapping time and an anklet shimmying; a very earnest young married cou with the wedding ring prominent and an impressive phalanx children in tow; the owner of the happy soprano, a sweet, contented, pre-moral face; the owner of the big male voic the inevitable rather effeminate man in every congregatio who loves religion because he loves Beauty. He is immense pleased that he knows all the words (the others just dab them): he sings them without any knowledge of their meani they sound Hawaiian. Also, we SPOT a tremendously old,  wrinkled, bent-over woman, dressed in white like a good  Christian, but with a bone stuck through the septum of he nose. She croaks, toothless, bleary-eyed. These things must be disposed of by late in the first sta which continues: "Open now the crystal fountain Whence the living waters f Let the fiery, cloudy pillar Lead me all my journey throu We close on the old dame with the bone singing -- "...my journey through." o.s., on "...fiery, cloudy pilla a queer SOUND, steadily louder: the absurdly flatulent,  yammering syncopation of a rachitic steam motor. Eyes beg to wander from hymnals: CUT IN Brother frowning and singi harder trying to impose order; attention to the hymn begi to fall apart a little; FOLLOW the white, veering eyes to FRAME, through the open window.
1) 24) text: Rose joins them at the door.
1) 25) dialog: (indifferently) Good morning, Mr. Allnutt.
1) 27) text: Rose's prayer book is clamped under her sharp elbow. Her  walking is used to country, yet tight and spinsterish.
1) 45) dialog: You take sugar, Mr. Allnutt, I seem  to remember.
1) 48) dialog: And cream.
1) 50) text: Rose passes him his tea.
1) 51) dialog: Bread and butter?
1) 53) text: He picks up his cup an inch to drink and puts it down aga Nobody else is served yet. Rose fixes Brother's tea and p it beside him. She puts a slice of bread and butter on hi plate.
1) 55) text: Rose finishes fixing her own tea, and helps herself to br and-butter. She lifts her cup, not quite crooking her pin and sips. Allnutt still doesn't move; he is waiting for  Brother. Brother finishes and turns his page, and, withou shifting his eyes, finds his tea with a blind hand and bl drinks it and sets down the cup again. Allnutt, licensed, takes a big bite of bread-and-butter and picks up his cup and washes it down. By Rose's covered reaction, it is cle that she has been taught never, never to do this, but tha she expects no better of such as Allnutt. Allnutt sighs w and contentedly. This, too, is bad manners to Rose, but s takes it in her stride. They go on soberly eating bread-and-butter and drinking t The only SOUNDS are those of china, sipping, chewing and  swallowing. Nobody looks at anyone else. Brother and Rose are wholly, stiffly reposeful; they are used to this. All begins to get a little squirmy, like a child in church. T silence makes him visibly uneasy, but he tries not to sho his uneasiness. All of a sudden, out of the silence, there is a SOUND lik mandolin string being plucked. At first the sound is  unidentifiable, though instantly all three glance sharply up, each at the other two, then away; in the next instant they recognize what it is and each glances sharply,  incredulously, at the other two -- and then again, quickl away; then Brother and Rose glance with full recognition Allnutt, at the instant that he knows the belly-growl is  his. At the moment of recognition, he glances down at his middle with a look of embarrassed reproach. He glances up quickly and slyly -- hopeful they've missed it -- to find the eyes of both still fixed on him. The instant their ey meet they bounce apart like billiard balls, and fix on th first neutral object they happen to hit. Then Allnutt loo at them again: neither will look at him. All three lift their cups at the same moment, for a cover disembarrassing drink of tea. Rose and Allnutt simultaneo recognize what they are doing (Brother is pretending to r misses it, and goes ahead and drinks his), and both, at t same moment, lower their cups to saucers with an almost  simultaneous clink. Both look away from each other. Broth clears his throat rather loudly and turns a page. Rose an Allnutt reach for their cups; Brother beats them to it. W Brother has again put down his cup, Rose -- the tail of h eye on Allnutt -- picks up her cup and drinks, her eyes  carefully empty above the cup. Allnutt has his cup again the way to his mouth when his insides give out with a gro so long-drawn and terrible that Rose first flinches, then makes a noise across it with her spoon, stirring her tea. Brother tightens up like a fist, his first reflex being t this loud one is a calculated piece of effrontery. Allnut just endures it, with a look of suffering stoicism. When is over there is a tense silence. Allnutt slowly, slyly l up at Brother; he is stone. He looks to Rose; she is gazi far off into space. Allnutt is quite embarrassed, and kno they are. He does his best to relieve his own embarrassme and theirs.
1) 59) text: A silence. Rose looks at Allnutt; their eyes meet; he attempts a fri smile. Her face goes stony with embarrassment and she loo quickly away. So does he.
1) 60) dialog: (as soon as she can  manage it) Do have another cup of tea, Mr.  Allnutt.
1) 64) text: Rose looks stone deaf. She hands him his cup.
1) 68) dialog: Bread and butter, Mr. Allnutt?
1) 70) text: He takes some and eats. After a little chewing, his jaws  slow; he is expecting another growl and listens intently; does Rose; none comes, After a little, Allnutt relaxes an Rose relaxes at least to a state of armed truce. They are both munching methodically, eyes out of focus, when Broth takes a curiously official-mannered gulp of tea, sets dow his cup, and breaks the silence.
1) 73) dialog: Who's that, dear?
1) 76) dialog: (dubiously) I think I remember. It was so long  ago.
1) 78) dialog: Splendid.

1) 110) dialog: (with great intensity) But what's happened! What do you  know about it!
1) 122) dialog: (bridling) God has not forgotten this place,  Mr. Allnutt -- as my brother's  presence here bears witness.
1) 128) text: as Brother and Rose come through after him.
1) 132) dialog: Goodbye, Mr. Allnutt.
1) 134) dialog: Shouldn't we perhaps call him back?  Get to Limbasi while we can?
1) 136) dialog: No, I suppose not.
1) 137) text: By now, the boat is pulling out; Brother and Allnutt exch their not very friendly waves. Rose looks idly after Alln in Sunday boredom. Nothing is said for a few seconds afte the boat vanishes; the SOUND of the engine dwindles.
1) 139) text: As he speaks, CAMERA STARTS a coldly SLOW PAN, past the  chapel, and square onto the jungle, so altering its posit behind Brother and Rose that they are held in -- l.s. (wh before they were in r.s.). (N.B.: BY MID-PAN the ENGINE SOUND dies.) An almost nude native explodes from the wall of jungle,  running as fast as he can, bellowing breathlessly in Swah and English. Until they hear his bellowing, Brother's and Rose's heads are still ANGLED AWAY from jungle -- not tow river still, but idle and unfocused. With the first sound his voice, their heads turn sharply, with weary impatienc not alarm, towards the sound. The native does not pause in the village, though he shout vague things in Swahili as he runs, setting up a kind of  helpless agitation among the villagers; in b.g. we see st more of them coming with lazy interest out of their huts, while the native tears towards the bungalow bellowing,  breathlessly.
1) 143) text: The eyes of Brother and Rose abruptly lift beyond the run and come into focus as hard as hawks; almost instantly, t faces become terrible with recognition, despair, and cour and, for the moment with uncertainty, still, whether such emotions are needed.
1) 147) text: o.s., the SOUND of their feet on the front steps. They co swiftly into the SHOT BELOW the CAMERA and walk fast, Ros trailing, towards the officer. After only a few steps Bro begins to trot, ungainly; Rose, still more ungainly, in h narrow skirt, trots too.
1) 156) dialog: (at same instant,  squatting beside  him, turning his  head; she is beside  herself) Judkins!
1) 157) text: CLOSE UP -- BROTHER -- (SHOOTING DOWN PAST ROSE) as she t his head.
1) 159) dialog: (across his words) Oh, Judkins. Brother dear. Come,  dear. Come, Brother.
1) 160) text: She helps him to his feet; past them, the officer and his guard walk briskly, aloofly away, and past the whole busi as Brother and Rose get up and the CAMERA LIFTS to normal eye level with them, a much later stage of the destructio of the village is visible in b.g. and is implied o.s. by  Brother's eyes. Brother's eyes, scorched-looking, appalled, all but demen flick from horror to horror; he is watching the annihilat of his life's work and, to his mind, the annihilation of  Christian and potential Christian souls; his head quavers the negative gesture like that of a paretic; his mouth, a hard up to this moment, trembles now and looks curiously  large and sensual.
1) 162) text: Rose is in the SHOT with him; shorter and less favored th he is. Her eyes are constantly upon his face. Tears come of her eyes, but she is doing no vocal crying. She is wat his heart break and, essentially, she is watching him die and knows it.
1) 169) dialog: gets up, deep concern on her face, comes quickly to him,  bringing both into SHOT, and lays a hand against his fore Her reaction infers that Brother has a terribly high feve

1) 181) text: He shuts the door in her face. For a moment she stands outside the door as if paralyzed. Then she starts somewhere fast. CLOSE UP -- THEIR FORLORNLY POPULATED BOOKSHELF. Rose hurries into the SHOT and takes down a large obsoles looking Home-Medical Compodium.
1) 182) dialog: SHOOTING LOW across the bleak dining room table as she hu the big book to it and opens it. She is standing. She is  still in a painful rush through the index when o.s. there the NOISE of a catastrophic fall.

1) 205) dialog: (o.s., a dry quiet  voice with the calm  of exhaustion in it) Come in, Mr. Allnutt.
1) 206) text: Her voice startles him as much as it should ourselves. He peers again, forehead wrinkled like a monkey's. He can't her. He shyly opens and comes through the door, mumbling  something apologetic and subversal. As he catches sight of her, SWING CAMERA to RIGHT, losing him, and PICK ROSE UP, MEDIUM CLOSE. She is past the angl of visibility from the screen door. She is in a wicker ro chair, sitting quite primly, working with those rings on  which embroidering is done. She glances up at him with ey like fused glass -- then quickly back to her needlework. is clear by the over-precision of her motions, and their  rigidity and tension, that she is under great strain, but this is to be keyed low and simple.
1) 209) dialog: (quietly, as before) Thank God you've come.
1) 211) dialog: (o.S.) Sit down, Mr. Allnutt.
1) 216) dialog: Yes, they got here. Just after you  left.
1) 220) dialog: (a quieter, remote  voice) Burning villages.
1) 222) dialog: Poor helpless natives!
1) 224) dialog: (same dead voice) Oh, trust them.
1) 226) dialog: (quietly, always) They are fiends out of hell... His  whole life's work smashed. Ruined.  In a few minutes.
1) 228) dialog: (pause; quietly) He's dead.
1) 230) dialog: They killed him.
1) 232) dialog: They didn't shoot him, Mr. Allnutt.  But they are accountable to God just  as surely as if they had.
1) 234) dialog: They broke his heart. He didn't take  care of himself. He didn't want to  live.
1) 237) dialog: Early this morning. (an odd gesture) He's in there.

1) 251) dialog: (a pause; then with  quick decision) I'll get my things ready.
1) 254) dialog: Thank you, Mr. Allnutt.
1) 260) text: Rose, without looking at him or at the grave, and without speaking, walks away; he picks up his spade and follows. MEDIUM SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT at the edge of the porch. Rose pauses, looks over towards Brother's grave for the l time. Allnutt stands beside her, carrying her suitcase, n wanting to hurry her again, but wishing she'd get a move
1) 263) dialog: (really meaning it;  but very restrained  and prim) It was very kind of you, Mr. Allnutt,  to think of the cross.
1) 265) text: Rose walks down the steps and towards the river. Allnutt  eagerly keeps pace. We SWING the CAMERA losing the grave, and passing and losing the chapel, and centering them get smaller along the bare ground in the hot sunlight, bringi in the river beyond them.
1) 268) dialog: (with the upward  English inflection --  a little as if he  had passed her a  teacup) Thank -- you?
1) 269) text: Allnutt steps aboard. MEDIUM SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT Rose sits down at the rea of the boat and looks around her. Her feet are drawn unde her and knees close together and hands lightly folded on knees (perhaps a lady's scrap of handkerchief in one hand as prim, genteel and ladylike as if, on a holiday afterno she were about to be rowed across an artificial lake fift yards wide. And that is more or less the way she glances  about her in her new surroundings -- politely and  restrainedly, as if a little critical of a parlor somewha humbler than her own. (This SHOT, at the very beginning of her voyage, is to be quite touching, delicate and ironical, and through her ve genteelism and total unconcern for what she is up against an unawareness -- we begin already to sense her complete  intrepidity.) Allnutt pauses to light up a cigarette before getting to  work. He hangs the cigarette inside his upper lip. This  cigarette, dead or alive, is a chronic fixture with Allnu Allnutt kneels in the bottom of the boat and addresses hi to the engine. He hauls out a panful of hot ashes and dum them overside with a sizzle and a splutter. He fills the  furnace with fresh wood from a pile beside him, and soon  smoke appears from the funnel, and we hear the ROAR of th draught. The engine begins to sigh and splutter, and then begins to leak gray pencils of steam. Allnutt peers at hi gauges, thrusts in some more wood, and then leaps forward around the engine, displaying monkeyish agility in handli more tasks than he quite has the hands or the stamina for With grunts and heaves of the small windlass, he hauls in the anchor, the sweat pouring from him in rivers. We see  already that he is physically not a strong man. Allnutt thrusts mightily at the muddy bank with a long po snatches the pole on board again, and then rushes aft to tiller.
1) 271) text: He sweeps her aside unceremoniously (she is astonished bu quickly reassembles herself) and he puts the tiller over  just in time to save the boat from running into the bank. CAMERA IN on Rose, resettling her plumage, and on Allnutt the tiller. The river bank starts to swing in square to t stern. Their eyes are past the CAMERA. MEDIUM SHOT -- (MOVING WITH BOAT) -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT Ros is deeply sad and very tired, but a very quiet kind of  exhilaration is already growing in her; and still more  clearly, her calm and tremendous, unreflecting resolutene begins to show. A pause.
1) 272) dialog: Mr. Allnutt.
1) 274) dialog: What are the chances of our getting  out through Limbasi on the railway  to the Coast?
1) 276) dialog: Then how do we get out, Mr. Allnutt?
1) 278) text: Rose's astonishment at this suggestion keeps her from  replying.
1) 280) text: Allnutt stands up and Rose takes over the tiller, holding the iron rod resolutely. Allnutt goes to his engine and i violently active once more. He pulls open the furnace doo and thrusts in a few sticks of fuel; then he scrambles up into the bow and stands balanced on the cargo. The river studded with islands so that it appears as if there were dozen different channels.
1) 282) text: CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE She is confused by the command.
1) 284) text: MOVING SHOT -- THE LAUNCH The boat crawls up a narrow tun of leaf and shade. (If color photography is used, the SHO would be startingly juicy and green -- many shades of gre reflected in rich brown water.) Allnutt comes leaping back over the cargo and shuts off t engine; the propeller stops vibrating. Allnutt dashes into the bow again. Just as the trees (SHO PAST ROSE and her interest in it) begin apparently to mov forward again as the current overcomes the boat's way, he lets go the anchor with a rattling CRASH, and almost with a jerk the launch comes to a standstill. A great silence seems to close in on them -- the silence a tropical river at noon. The only SOUND is the subdued r and gargle of the water. The sober air is filled with a  strange light -- a green light. Allnutt turns from his work at the anchor. He and Rose lo about them and at each other, for a moment mysteriously  bemused by the stillness and by the beauty of the place. sudden quietness and the look of the place are richly  romantic; the two people are quieted by it, but they are  wholly unaware of any such potentiality between them. The are just a couple of oddly assorted derelicts who hardly  even know each other, and don't care for what little they know. A pause.
1) 286) text: He laughs at his joke and is disappointed when Rose does join him.
1) 287) dialog: I'm afraid, Mr. Allnutt, that what  you suggest is quite impossible.
1) 289) text: Rose opens the map and starts studying it.
1) 291) dialog: (blankly) The Louisa? What's that?
1) 293) dialog: What's that?
1) 295) dialog: I see.
1) 297) dialog: This river, the Ulanga, runs into  the lake, doesn't it?
1) 299) dialog: Why not?
1) 301) dialog: He got down it. I remember.
1) 303) text: While he talks, Rose begins to look restive and vague, as well as discouraged. By the time he is through, she has s up, CAMERA WITH HER; she hardly hears him. She strolls a  little aimlessly PAST THE CAMERA, which SWINGS TO CENTER BACK as she walks forward. As if half in her sleep, she  sidesteps the engine. REVERSE ANGLE -- ROSE (SHOOTING FROM THE BOW) as Rose  sidesteps. She walks toward CAMERA into MEDIUM CLOSE UP,  eyes glazing with dreamlike concentration. She sees somet before and below her eye-level; stops, focusing on it. CLOSE SHOT -- (FROM ROSE'S ANGLE) -- THE GELATINE CASES n marked or labeled as such.
1) 307) dialog: 
1) 308) dialog: What did you say is in these boxes  with the red lines on them?
1) 309) text: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (FROM ROSE'S ANGLE) loung and lazy.
1) 312) dialog: (head towards him,  away from CAMERA) Isn't it dangerous?
1) 314) dialog: (sharply, yet absently  as she turns into  CAMERA) No. We may need it.
1) 316) dialog: (not looking up) Mr. Allnutt --
1) 322) dialog: 
1) 323) dialog: (sharply, yet still  more subconsciously  and quietly than  before) I wouldn't do that.
1) 325) dialog: They look like -- like torpedoes.
1) 326) text: "Torpedoes" is spoken over: INSERT -- CYLINDERS -- a new and most deadly possible loo SHOT of the cylinders. STILL CLOSER SHOT -- ROSE Slowly she raises her eyes from floor angle to normal; a wild light is dawning in her eye
1) 327) dialog: (in the voice almost  of a medium) Mr. Allnutt --
1) 331) text: MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE -- (FROM ALLNUTT'S ANGLE) walki slowly and somewhat portentously towards him.
1) 332) dialog: (full of the wild  light) You're a machinist, aren't you? Wasn't  that your position at the mine?
1) 335) text: CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE -- (FROM ALLNUTT'S ANGLE) disconcertin close.
1) 336) dialog: Could you make a torpedo?
1) 338) dialog: Could you make a torpedo.
1) 341) text: He relaxes; his manner is "The State Rests." SWING CAMERA to center Rose, still perched on the gunwale
1) 342) dialog: (after a short pause;  unperturbed) But all those things, those gyroscopes  and things, they're only to make it  go, aren't they?
1) 345) dialog: 
1) 346) dialog: (at the height of her  inventiveness; the  words triumphant and  almost stumbling out) Well! We've got The African Queen.
1) 348) dialog: If we put this -- this blasting stuff --  in the front of the boat here -- and  a -- what did you say -- deno --  detonator there, why that would be a  torpedo, wouldn't it?
1) 351) dialog: 
1) 352) dialog: Then if we ran the boat against the  side of a ship, they'd -- well, they'd  go off, just like a torpedo. (somewhat doubtfully,  in a return to her  submissive feminine  habit) Wouldn't they?
1) 355) dialog: I wasn't thinking that we should be  in the launch. Couldn't we get  everything ready and have a -- what  do you call it -- a good head of  steam up and point the launch toward  the ship and then dive off before it  hit? Wouldn't that do?
1) 357) dialog: Oh, yes there is.
1) 359) dialog: Something to torpedo.
1) 361) dialog: The Louisa.
1) 363) dialog: Spengler did.
1) 365) text: Rose looks stubborn.
1) 366) dialog: If a German did it, we can, too.
1) 368) dialog: How do you know? You've never tried.
1) 370) text: A pause. They look at each other, Rose much more fixedly searchingly than Allnutt
1) 371) dialog: In other words, you are refusing to  help your country in her hour of  need, Mr. Allnutt?
1) 373) dialog: Well then --!
1) 375) text: Allnutt stands perplexed and inarticulate, his cigarette  drooping from his upper lip. His wandering gaze strays fr Rose's feet, up her white drill frock to her face; he sta slightly at her implacable expression.
1) 376) dialog: Very well, let's get started.
1) 378) dialog: (impatiently) Yes, now. Come along.
1) 380) dialog: We can go a long way in two hours.
1) 381) text: Allnutt starts to speak; refrains; limps over to windlass and raises the anchor. Rose watches him. CAMERA PANS afte The African Queen as Allnutt backs her out into the chann then turns her nose downstream.
1) 385) text: Rose nods. Her hand takes a firmer, more authoritative ho on the tiller.
1) 387) text: Rose again shifts her hand a little; and she sits up very straight with her new sense of responsibility.
1) 389) dialog: I've heard of them.
1) 391) dialog: Isn't that a bit -- well, silly? Why  not just say left and right?
1) 393) dialog: Why yes, I see. It's really quite --  sensible, isn't it?
1) 395) text: Rose puts the tiller to starboard; the launch swerves a l to port. She looks at Allnutt, bewildered. Allnutt is qui amused.
1) 397) dialog: (eagerly) Oh, I see!
1) 398) text: Rose lifts her own hand from the tiller to show; the boat yaws abruptly.
1) 400) text: Rose, startled, grabs the tiller and rights her course.
1) 401) dialog: (blushing) Sorry.
1) 403) dialog: Why, the water -- well -- pushes  against the rudder, where it turns,  and -- sort of drags the boat that  way. Turns it.
1) 405) text: Rose looks as pleased as if she had personally invented t rudder.
1) 407) dialog: Is that all there is to it?
1) 409) dialog: Read?
1) 411) dialog: Steer clear of. Why, that's where  that expression comes from.
1) 417) text: Rose looks very seriously, almost reprimandingly, towards the "V."
1) 422) dialog: her eyes to starboard. Again the light is later. Rose's f is a shade more pleased and in bloom than before.
1) 423) dialog: (pointing) What's that queer flat place, Mr.  Allnutt?
1) 429) dialog: It makes us -- it -- pushes the boat  around?
1) 435) dialog: (louder) Oh. Of course.
1) 436) text: Allnutt is intently busy at the feed pump -- this time, a brief operation. Rose watches him out; he does a little  refueling. (Wood is piled high in the waist now, drying i the sun.) (NOTE: From here on until indicated, no TWO SHOTS. Allnut is amidship, in hot sunlight; Rose, at stern, in cool, br shadow of awning.)
1) 437) dialog: What was the matter, Mr. Allnutt?
1) 439) dialog: What happens when the feed pump  chokes?
1) 442) dialog: Why, so we can go, of course.
1) 444) text: Rose looks blank, and interested.
1) 446) dialog: Oh. The water doesn't push against  the rudder hard enough to --
1) 448) text: Rose looks at him, for the first time aware that he is as important to navigation as she is.
