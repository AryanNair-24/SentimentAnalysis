9) 5) dialog: Well, my daughter, Angela, she got abducted, and she got raped and murdered seven months ago, on this self-same stretch o’ road here, unfortunately, and, to me... I mean, to me, it seems like the local police department is too busy goin’ round torturing black folks to be bothered doing anything about solving actual crime, so I kinda thought these here billboards might, y’know, concentrate their minds some.
10) 2) dialog: Seems like the local police department is too busy goin’ round torturing black folks to be bothered doing anything about solving actual crime... DIXON’S MOMMA looks at him.
11) 1) dialog: I don’t know what these policemen are doing, to be honest with you. I just know my daughter’s burnt body’s lying six feet under the ground while they’re eating Krispy Kremes and busting eight year-olds for skateboarding in parking lots.

11) 17) dialog: The time it’s took you to come out here whining like a bitch, Willoughby, some other poor girl's probably being butchered right now, but it’s good you've got your priorities straight, Ill say that for ya.
11) 19) dialog: I know it.
11) 21) dialog: I know it. Most everbody in town knows it.

12) 32) dialog: Father Montgomery.
12) 35) dialog: Crap about what?
12) 37) dialog: Oh. Proceed.
12) 39) dialog: Took a poll, did ya, Father?
12) 41) dialog: ¥/know what I was thinking about, earlier today? I was thinking ‘bout those streetgangs they got in Los Angeles, the Crips and the Bloods? I was thinking about that buncha new laws they came up with, in the 80’s I think it was, to combat those street-gangs, those Crips and those Bloods. (MORE )
12) 43) dialog: And, if I remember rightly, the gist of what those new laws said was, if you join one of these gangs, and you're running with ‘em, and down the block from you one night, unbeknownst to you, your fellow Crips, or your fellow Bloods, shoot up a place, or stab a guy, well, even though you didn’t know nothing about it, even though you may’ve just been standing on a streetcorner minding your own business, those new laws said you are still culpable. You are still culpable, by the very act of joining those Crips, or those Bloods, in the first place. Which got me thinking, Father, that whole type of situation is kinda similar to you Church boys, ain’t it? You've got your colors, you've got your clubhouse, you're, for want of a better word, a gang. And if you're upstairs smoking a pipe and reading a bible while one of your fellow gang members is downstairs fucking an altar boy then, Father, just like the Crips, and just like the Bloods, you're culpable. Cos you joined the gang, man. And I don’t care if you never did shit or never saw shit or never heard shit. You joined the gang. You’re culpable. And when a person is culpable to altar-boy-fucking, or any- kinda-boy-fucking, I know you guys didn’t really narrow it down, then they kinda forfeit the right to come into my house and say a word about me, or my life, or my daughter, or my billboards. So, why don’t you just finish your tea there, Father, and get the fuck outta my kitchen.
15) 9) dialog: I don’t know what it is. The filling feels like it’s kinda waggling. GEOFFREY, a fat dentist, appears, with his instruments.
15) 11) dialog: (bemused) Ain’t you gonna have a look at it first? GEOFFREY does so, perfunctorily.
15) 13) dialog: Uh, can I get a little Novocaine, there, Doc? He puts the drill down, gets a syringe, injects in under gum at painful angles and length, takes it out and looks his watch, just sitting there.
15) 15) dialog: (pause) Maybe it wasn’t waggling. Maybe it was just my fingers going in and out. Silence. He picks up the drill again, gets it going.
15) 17) dialog: Then why don’t you tell those good friends of Bill Willoughby to tell Bill Willoughby to go do his fucking job, fat boy. She pushes the screaming bloody dentist out of the way, rinses her mouth out with the pink stuff, spits it at his head, and exits.
