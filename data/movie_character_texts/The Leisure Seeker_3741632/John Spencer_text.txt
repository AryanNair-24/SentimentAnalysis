Nick’s dad does a cesarian with a pocket knife and sews it up with fishing line and you see it all. You put the story down and you suffer an existential crisis. The realization that who we are ends, that that's it! So beautifully crafted. A work of poetry and it’s prose - it’s prose that’s poetry! The waitress nods with a polite smile.
2) 50) dialog: Prose that is poetry. That’s Hemingway's secret. Do you have any idea how difficult that is to do?
2) 53) dialog: Just don’t confuse his simplicity with banality. Did you read...

There are of course, more elegant ways to travel, but there is no denying that one sleeps extremely well in that stupid bed. How about you, my princess? Did you sleep well?

6) 5) dialog: I was just outside. Your pain?
6) 7) dialog: Where are we exactly?
6) 9) dialog: Chester County? Some really beautiful country around here. Country imbued with history. It’s so good to be back on the road again. I love it.

11) 17) dialog: So you still see him. John speaks this phrase abruptly, as if part of an ongoin conversation. Ella gives him a confused look:
11) 19) dialog: You speak with him on the phone. You write him letters.
11) 21) dialog: (chuckles) Ah, so now we're pretending like you don’t know... Dan. You said he’s living in Daytona now. Ella starts to laugh again.
11) 23) dialog: But you asked about him.
11) 25) dialog: (sad) All these lies. All these years. John stands up and goes back into the camper, muttering, leaving Ella in amazement at the table.

11) 62) dialog: (surprised) What?
11) 64) dialog: (xidiculous) I didn't!
11) 66) dialog: Me? Going somewhere? Without you? Are you crazy? She snorts, tired of this childish bickering. They are si for a while and then John once again puts a hand on her k
11) 67) dialog: How you doing, little lady? She removes his hand, still shaken, sullen and sore. She rummages through her purse, in search of tablets. She tri to open a bottle of Pepsi but her hands are too shaky. Jo is watching out of the corner of his eye and reaches for bottle:
11) 68) dialog: Let me. She needs to drink it to swallow her pills so reluctantly lets him take the bottle-
11) 73) dialog: Yup? Scene 29 Page 49.
11) 75) dialog: You need to pee?
11) 77) dialog: So?
11) 79) dialog: Why? They don’t want me...
11) 87) dialog: (looking seriously at the policeman, engaged, eager to help) Yes, sir. I was trying to open the... the thing’n.

11) 90) dialog: (as if obviously) The bottle. Another long silence, John watches the policeman as he lo closely at both passengers. And then John turns his head Ella and emits:

12) 10) dialog: Lillian?
13) 0) text: John, smiling in his sleep, cheerfully murmurs something “Ella, where are you going .. don’t be that way, come her hey, wait ..”. He wakes from his happy dream, deeply disoriented. We see the inside of the camper through his milky, fuzzy gaze. Details come into focus: objects on th bedside table, his shoes, and then someone lying next to a back, an arm, a neck. Finally, the plucked head of Ella John shakes her gently. She opens her eyes.
13) 1) dialog: Excuse me, where’s Ella?
13) 3) dialog: No - Ella. Ella Carson. My girl. 22, long blonde hair. She’s gorgeous. Ella, half asleep, slowly understands what’s happening. Unnerved, she rises with some effort. She pulls her wig o loosely, drapes a sweater over her shoulders, and steppin into her shoes as if they were slippers she leaves the ca without a word. Left alone, dazed, John tries to focus on his location as dream fades. He gets up and leaves the motor-home. Outside, he spots Ella sitting alone on a park bench in t moonlight, her back to him.
13) 4) dialog: Is that really you, Ella? She answers with controlled fury.
13) 6) dialog: I’m me. John.

15) 72) dialog: Sweetheart, make sure the safety’s off before you start shooting, okay?
15) 78) dialog: You fellas should consider evening classes. Get your diplomas! Turn things around. S’not too late! The Plymouth peels away. There’s a moment of silence. Ell still has the shotgun pointed.

15) 124) dialog: Houston, we have a problem.
15) 127) dialog: Wanta go see.
15) 129) dialog: I want to have a look - John is out of the vehicle in an instant, and Ella’s too tired to chase after him. All she can do is yell:
15) 134) dialog: But this is so much fun!
15) 136) dialog: See you later, everybody! Make America great again! Those gathered nearby raise their beer bottles to toast J

All the slides are of Jan and Will: swimming in the ocean, stuffing cake into their mouths at a birthday party, Trick-or-Treating, rolling in piles of raked leaves, posing rigidly by the fireplace, sitting on Santa’s lap at a shopping center, close-up portraits... Ella and John are once again seated outside the Leisure Seeker like they’re at a cinema. There are no other campe around, only the deep coniferous woods that surround the camp. John eats a sandwich, while Ella swallows a blue painkiller. There’s no commentary from her this time, no narration. She’s not in a good way. And then John opens h mouth:
16) 1) dialog: Look how cute Jane was! Ella smiles and nods yes, happy that John is enthusiastic Next comes a photo of Will sitting on the shoulders of a tall, handsome man with an intelligent expression. Scene 39 Page 74.

16) 3) dialog: How’s Jim these days?
16) 5) dialog: That’s terrible. Poor Jim. Ella watches him, trying to read his thoughts. And then J looks at her.
16) 6) dialog: Promise me something.
16) 8) dialog: If you love me, when the time comes, put the shotgun in my hands, put my finger on the trigger, remind me what I want to do, kiss me and walk away. It’s like mud season in Massachusetts. Messy but necessary. Ella reaches out and firmly grips her husband's hand. She presses the button to continue the show, but the caro is at its end. White light almost blinds them. John instinctively pulls out the power cord to kill the painfu light, leaving them in near-darkness.
16) 10) dialog: I can’t find the outlet. Scene 39 Page 75. And then they hear what sounds like an animal in the bush
16) 12) dialog: Unlikely it’s an alligator. He'd be on us by now.
