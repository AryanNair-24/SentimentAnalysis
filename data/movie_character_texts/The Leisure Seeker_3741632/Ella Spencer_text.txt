1) 10) dialog: Excuse me?
1) 12) dialog: (scandalized laugh) What are you talking about? You can’t say that! But she also sniffs the air, then cranes her neck to look between the seats - there’s a wisp of smoke coming from t engine’s trap door. She leans forward to pull a rug from beneath her feet. Sh places it over the leak. He glances at her, but soon loses interest and looks back the road ahead. They're passing through a leafy suburb filled with banner and signs from the 2016 campaign. A bus full of school ki passes; some of them point and make faces. Ella waves to them through the window.
1) 13) dialog: Hello! Hi! Such beautiful children... you can go now, hon. The street’s clear. John? Go! Put that old engine to work!

1) 33) dialog: Well, they’re amazing. You should take the family. Do you have children? The man’s face darkens momentarily with sadness. But he overcomes it.
1) 35) dialog: Certainly. She pulls money from her purse and leans out the window t hand it to him. As she does, she quietly confides:
1) 36) dialog: John is a much more sophisticated tourist than me. Oh, he likes to travel, but he thinks travel should broaden the intellectual horizons, whatever that’s supposed to mean... The attendant pockets the money and gives her a curt nod.
1) 38) dialog: Thank you, and I’m sorry if I spoke too much. I do love to chitchat. (to John) Let’s roll, hon! John does as he’s told, putting the camper in gear, but a soon as they start to move the Female Attendant waves the a stop. There’s something in her hand.
1) 40) dialog: What a nice woman! She found one in the storeroom. (She puts on her reading glasses) Its expiry date was last April, but it’1l still be all right, don’t you think? You want half, hon? Scene 6 Page 8. (shakes his head) I want a burger.
1) 41) dialog: It’s not lunch time yet. There was something sweet about that woman. She had such pretty eyes. Pretty, but sad. They both did. Don’t you think, John? John seems to consider her question, but then, as if sayi it for the first time:
2) 2) dialog: Hello, Chantal. I’m Ella and this is John. Looks like you’re stuck with us!

2) 32) dialog: Your father and I didn’t decide a thing. You and Will and those quack doctors did that for us. Will cannot resist. He grabs the phone back from Jane. Scene 10 Page 12.
2) 34) dialog: Sick doesn’t quite describe it, Will. I’m something else altogether.
2) 37) dialog: I've had it up to here with their treatment. I’ve been there, I’ve done that, it wasn’t pretty.
2) 39) dialog: Kids, try to understand. Let me have this vacation with your father.

2) 55) dialog: Thanks, Chantal, we’re fine.
2) 58) dialog: Eat, John. You want me to cut it up for you? John lowers his eyes toward the plate.

2) 91) dialog: That’s the plan.
2) 93) dialog: What people? My parents? They’re dead, John.
2) 95) dialog: I wonder if they’re having fun up there, if it’s a joyous place, where you sing and dance while drinking Happy Swirls all day. What do you think happens, you know, after? John? John, incongruously, begins to sing:

4) 13) dialog: I’m finally taking John to Hemingway's house in Key West - have you ever been? They both shake their heads.
4) 16) dialog: Yes. I never understood why... Scene 14 Page 21. Ella's voice trails off. For a moment, she seems deeply m and lost in thought, as if she’s only now beginning to understand why. But then she snaps out of it.
4) 17) dialog: John knows everything about him. He’s always wanted to see that house. Every year I’d promise him we'd go, but, you know how it is travelling with little kids... of course we've been to Melville's place. That’s just a few hours from our house. Have you been there? He wrote Moby Dick. It’s very interesting. Her neighbors nod, not knowing what to make of all this.
4) 18) dialog: .». it was actually a big pain in the rear for me and Will (she laughs). My daughter loved it. I think that’s why she became a professor. John is so proud of her. He’s a teacher too.

6) 17) text: The Leisure Seeker moves down Route 1, passing the skylin of Baltimore and Washington. The road is ugly here.

6) 44) dialog: I can’t believe this. But you should know, if Daniel Coleman is alive - and that’s a big if - he’s been living in Daytona for the past thirty years. She closely watches John, who is now driving in silence.
6) 45) dialog: You hear me? She sighs, then mutters to herself, still in a state of shock.
6) 46) dialog: Dan Coleman. Honestly. Of all the... John, eyes fixed on the road ahead, asks:

7) 38) dialog: You know I’m someone dear to you, but you’re not exactly sure who. He smiles but doesn’t answer. She persists:

7) 43) dialog: John, tell me who I am.
