8) 35) dialog: With apologies, Sir. Your celestial fix is slightly off. I moved it two degrees North.
8) 37) dialog: Which means that map you've almost completed -- I’m afraid you'll have to start over.

14) 16) dialog: These will be the last words of Carina Smyth. OUT A PIECE OF PAPER AND BEGINS TO READ. CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D) Good Sirs -- I am not a witch and have never practiced witchcraft. But I forgive your common dim-wittedness and feeble brains incapable of educated thought. In short, most of you have the mind of a goat -- Jack yells out from the guillotine.
14) 18) dialog: Sir, I believe I was making a point. If you could just be patient.
14) 20) dialog: And my neck is to be broken.
14) 22) dialog: What?

15) 61) dialog: You're that pirate -- Jack Sparrow.
15) 63) dialog: What do you want with me? Where is my diary? JACK HOLDS UP HER DIARY.
15) 65) dialog: If you could read it -- then it wouldn’t be called The Map No Man Can Read.
15) 68) dialog: If no one can read it -- then you have no use for it or me.
15) 71) dialog: Nobody has this map -- as it does not exist -- 41.
15) 73) dialog: The name clearly defines it as an imperceptible object.
15) 75) dialog: Then we all agree there is no map?
15) 83) dialog: I am not a witch.
15) 85) dialog: I’m an astronomer.
15) 87) dialog: An astronomer contemplates the stars. The planets. This is what I was doing when they arrested me. I had mapped the solar system. A LONG BEAT AS THEY ALL STARE AT HER --— 42.
15) 91) dialog: If they kill me you’1ll never get the map.
15) 95) dialog: You can kidnap me, imprison me, kill me if you wish. But I’1ll never give you what you want! And now Jack puts the sword away.

16) 1) dialog: What kind of tea did you say it was?
16) 3) dialog: It has a funny taste. I can’t quite figure it out --
16) 5) dialog: Can you keep a secret, Captain Jack?
16) 7) dialog: There’s a reason the Map has never been read by any man. Or woman. She leans in close now -- whispers to him. CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D) The Map is written in the stars.
16) 10) dialog: Galileo's diary dates back to the first astronomer -- Plato himself. The diary is full of celestial binomials -- equations passed down through the centuries from scholar to scholar -- the last being my father. None of them could figure it out.
16) 12) dialog: Once every 243 years the planet Venus crosses directly in front of Orion’s Belt -- known as the Three Fingers of God. This event is known as The Transit of Venus.
16) 14) dialog: This is the answer to the equation. With a clear sky the stars themselves will map the Devil’s Triangle.
16) 16) dialog: How could you know about the Trident?
16) 19) dialog: After tonight -- I’1l never be called a witch again!
16) 21) dialog: As the sun sets -- my destiny begins! AND NOW CARINA PASSES OUT -- SHE’S FACE DOWN ON THE TABLE

18) 39) dialog: As is my right -- I will name it the Coffin Island -- after the coffin star Delphinus. There is a clear passage from the West, Jack -- it is here that we will find the Trident! Gentleman -- set sail for the Devil’s Triangle --
19) 2) dialog: So that was a mutiny. I must admit it was rather exciting. All those swords and guns. The larger men holding you down and beating you when you refused to leave. The smaller men lining up to slap you --
19) 4) dialog: Two?
19) 6) dialog: And you blame me? The woman you kidnapped?
19) 8) dialog: I am not a witch!
19) 10) dialog: On that we both agree. 54.
19) 12) dialog: You did not save me out of courtesy. You seek the Trident --
19) 14) dialog: A spirit?
19) 16) dialog: Ghosts! That is what all of you pirates are afraid of? GHOSTS!!
19) 18) dialog: I assure you, there are no ghosts in the Devil’s Triangle or anywhere else. Science does not support it.
19) 20) dialog: Did I not predict the crossing of Venus?
19) 22) dialog: And who taught you that?
19) 24) dialog: Was she academically inclined? 55.
19) 26) dialog: My calculations are precise and true. I’m not just an astronomer -- I’m also a horologist.
19) 28) dialog: No. A Horologist!
19) 30) dialog: Horology is the study of time.
19) 32) dialog: Time is everything, Captain Sparrow.
19) 34) dialog: This Chronometer keeps the exact time in London. If I make an altitude measurement to a known heavenly body such as the sun -- we will find land. LIGHT REFLECTS OFF THE CHRONOMETER -- BLINDING JACK.
19) 36) dialog: East is that way. Row!
21) 0) text: Carina is sweating, suffering from the heat as she reads chronometer -- taking notes as she tries to figure out wh they are and where to go. Jack is exhausted -- still rowi - but secretly happy that she is lost.

21) 4) dialog: You are an abject creature. A befouled pirate.
21) 6) dialog: JACK SPARROW (CONT’D) Something wrong with your map?
21) 7) dialog: I don’t require any help.
21) 11) dialog: A gift from my father -- a father I never knew.
21) 13) dialog: He was a scientist. The earring was left to me after he died -- along with a love of the stars. The most beautiful thing there is.
21) 15) dialog: Don’t you ever look up?
21) 17) dialog: They are forever connected. A map maker’s sextant calculates the angle between a star and the horizon. So even if they are worlds apart, they are forever entwined -- the stars and the horizon existing as lovers.
21) 21) dialog: No. Lovers in the tragic sense. As they are destined to never be together.
21) 23) dialog: You’re the only one who’s lost, Jack Sparrow.
21) 26) dialog: Land! Right on time.
22) 6) dialog: We need to find passage into the Triangle --
22) 8) dialog: Me? 61.
22) 10) dialog: Then I shall go right away. I’m glad I can finally trust you.
22) 13) dialog: 
22) 18) dialog: Gentlemen, my name is Carina Smyth -- and I am looking for a ship and a crew to take me into the Devil’s Triangle. Or more precisely, the Coffin Island -- which I have recently named -- and which has never been seen by any man.

26) 16) dialog: I drew it.
26) 18) dialog: No island you’ve ever seen. It hides the Tomb of Poseidon.
26) 20) dialog: I’m not sure. I finished the equation -- did everything right. It should be here.
26) 22) dialog: Handed down to me in Galileo’s Diary. An equation no man had ever solved --
26) 25) dialog: I copied that map from the stars, where it was hidden for thousands of years.
26) 27) dialog: So you believe you know more of the constellations than I? CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D) On that I’d wager.
26) 29) dialog: Go on and choose. AND BARBOSSA POINTS TO A SPOT IN THE SKY.
26) 32) dialog: Carina. That is the star Carina. Barbossa turns back to her now. CARINA SMYTH (CONT’D) The star which gave me my name. Barbossa looks at the star -- then pulls his knife and wa back to her. She closes her eyes -- waiting to be killed
26) 75) dialog: Mr. Barbossa, what will you do with Jack when we get there?
26) 77) dialog: And Jack's life is that price?
26) 79) dialog: He’s a fellow pirate, is he not?
26) 81) dialog: More than you could know.
26) 83) dialog: I will present it to the King -- hand him his greatest treasure. And from that day forward my name will be pronounced with high regard. And I’1l never be called a witch again.
26) 85) dialog: You have no loyalty. 73.
26) 87) dialog: The sea is not alive, Mr. Barbossa. It cannot return favor.
26) 89) dialog: So you feel nothing for any living soul?

30) 4) dialog: I've been looking for you.
30) 7) dialog: Is something wrong?
30) 10) dialog: Whatever happens, I just want you to know that I was wrong about you, Jack. You saved my life three times.
30) 12) dialog: I know I said the horizon and the stars were destined to never be together. But now I believe I was wrong.
30) 14) dialog: Are you saying there’s nothing between us? gl.
30) 16) dialog: I've spent my life looking to the stars. Perhaps I should have been looking out to sea.
30) 20) dialog: The Three Fingers of God.
30) 22) dialog: No, behind you! Those rocks line up exactly as the stars of Orion! We’ve found it!!
30) 29) dialog: Orion is called the hunter. The stars in the shape of a bow just as those are formed. You see it now --
30) 36) dialog: That must be it. Come on!
31) 3) dialog: This isn’t a place. The map ends here. Look at the walls.
31) 12) dialog: Those aren't diamonds. They’re stars.
32) 18) dialog: 
32) 20) dialog: We’re standing inside it.
32) 24) dialog: It’s not to be read. It’s to be completed. This cave -- these diamonds -- it’s the solar system -- The Map No Man Can Read. Every star exactly in its place. It’s all here -- we're seeing what God sees.
32) 33) dialog: That's the Milky Way, Orion’s Belt. Coming across here is --
32) 35) dialog: Yes. That is Carina.
32) 37) dialog: The one that’s missing. And it’s right there -- that space on the wall.
32) 39) dialog: The third planet from the sun. Earth. We're missing.
32) 47) dialog: The Map is complete.
34) 5) dialog: It’s real, isn’t it?
34) 18) dialog: What’s happening?
34) 48) dialog: I can see it in your eyes -- you will not kill me.
34) 50) dialog: Then run me through, Captain Barbossa. And prove me wrong.
34) 52) dialog: What will you do with it? 100.
34) 54) dialog: How could you give up a treasure like this without a thought? Can you not see it’s perfect? What kind of man are you?
35) 5) dialog: This way. Hurry!
