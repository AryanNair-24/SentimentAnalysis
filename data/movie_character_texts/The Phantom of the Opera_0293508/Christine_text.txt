6) 15) text: SEMI C.V. OF CHRISTINE. This is a character study of a wistful, sad-eyed  creature, who dresses listlessly because she  has about given up hope--a couple of tears roll  down her cheeks, though she strives bravely to  keep them back --then she dashes them away with her  sleeve, angry at her weakness--all of a sudden she  starts and listens.

A dangerous  light gleams in Raoul's eyes. He tosses his  brother aside and exits. The women gasp  and Philippe is furious and aghast.
17) 8) text: There is another panic going on. Stage hands, principals and ballet corps are in a mad rush  to get out, knocking over scenery and props. Sud- denly Raoul appears...fighting his way and  looking extremely anxiously for Christine. His  clothing is nearly torn from his body.  He fights  his way to the dressing room corridor.
18) 1) text: Attendants, stage hands, ballet girls are  running about and are collected in groups,  excitedly discussing the tragedy. One  group is gathering about Christine who has  fainted. Raoul enters from stage, disheveled  as a result of his battle to get there. As he  comes forward, he sees Christine, and with a  cry, he pushes thru the group and stooping,  lifts her into his arms. Then demanding the  location of her dressing room, he follows,  carrying her after the frightened group.

The doctor feels  Christine's forehead and then as he is about to open his case, Christine glances up and sees Raoul. At that moment, Raoul looks at her. His eyes plead. Fear returns to Christine's eyes. She touches the doctor's arm and entreats him:

20) 12) text: The corridor is now empty except for Raoul. He is  pacing the corridor in agony of mind. Something terrible has happened to Christine. He hears a movement and disappears around the corner of the  corridor just as the physician enters from  Christine's dressing room and exits.

It grows wider, revealing a sliding door. Then a figure in evening dress, wearing a black mask, enters carrying a candelabra and a violin. He comes to the foreground where he manipulates some machinery on the wall and presses close to the wall with his masked face. SEMI C.V. CHRISTINE ON COUCH. Suddenly part of the mirror behind her becomes  transparent, revealing the upper portion of the  masked face.

He had left the room an instant before and no man except the physician was there. He draws closer to the door and as he continues to hear, he shows more astonishment and bewilderment. Then afire with jealous suspicion, he is about to put his hand on the latch to confront Christine and the unknown man when some- thing he hears halts him. INT. PASSAGEWAY BEHIND MIRROR.

20) 71) text: INT. CHRISTINE'S DRESSING ROOM.
20) 75) text: As Raoul runs into the scene from Christine's  dressing room, a solemn procession enters from  the stairs leading to the first cellar.  Two men  are carrying the body of Joseph Buquet upon a  stretcher. Buquet's face is covered with a handker- chief which has been dampened and will cling closely to his face. There are five other stage hands and the procession including Simon and Florine.  Simon leans heavily on two companions-stage hands and  sobs silently. All have their heads down. As  procession comes from the cellar, moves toward the stage, interrupts Raoul's hasty exit and delays him. He slows up his pace and bows his head in the presence of death.

20) 138) text: BACK: Her grandmother - as Christine shudders in horror and shaking her head in the negative, clings  to her grandmother in terror. The latter whose heart  yearns for the welfare of the sweet young girl  continues to comfort her. Suddenly both start as they  hear:
20) 145) text: As Mme. Valerius greets Lavelle. The latter  produces Raoul's letter and hands it to the  woman. As he starts to explain about it,  Mme. Valerius places her finger to her lips  quickly to caution him. Then shaking her head  in the negative with a warning expression that  Christine must not know, she quickly hides the  letter in her bodice.
20) 147) text: INT. CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM.
20) 148) text: Christine has heard voices and curious, she arises  and exits.
20) 150) text: Mme. Valerius and Lavelle hear Christine coming.  The woman again registers a look of warning. Then  Christine enters. She greets Lavelle who is very  nervous and uncomfortable and anxious to get away.  Her wistful look is suddenly illuminated by a  hopeful smile. She presses her hands together and  says:
20) 155) text: BACK: He is confused and tongue-tied: he looks  toward Mme. Valerius whose eyes show warning.  He recovers his poise, a bit, and shakes his head  in the negative, Christine's face falls and she  swallows hard. Lavelle takes the chance to get  away. He places his hand on the door latch and says:
20) 159) text: BACK: Christine nods but her mind is far away. Lavelle bows, then exits.
20) 160) text: SEMI C.V. CHRISTINE & GRANDMOTHER.
20) 161) text: Two tears roll down Christine's cheeks. The other  swallows hard. She just cannot be cruel. She  pulls the letter from her bodice and pushes it  up with Raoul's letter. As Christine sees it, her  face is transfigured with joy. She seizes it  eagerly. Then is swept into her grandmother's  arms. When the other releases her, Christine  hungrily tears open the envelope and reads:

On the right there is a little  arbor. Christine is discovered, occupied with  thoughts of long ago. Christine's dress is so  conceived that it will lend to the spiritual quality of her character. She is sad and passive and looks a frail little figure.

20) 221) text: At these words from Raoul, a deathly pallor spreads over Christine's face...she almost faints. Raoul becomes conscious of his odious behavior and seeks  to apologize. Then suddenly her eyes moisten and    two great tears roll down her cheeks. Raoul tries to take her in his arms, but she escapes and flees  in great disorder. Raoul calls after her, then  angry at himself...turns and gazes, gloomily out over the sea.
20) 223) text: As Christine flees into scene from behind camera.  Then she steps and turns around revealing that she  is sorry she ran away. She makes up her mind  to explain everything to him...exits back behind  camera.
20) 226) text: Raoul is gazing despondently out to sea when Christine  slips up behind him. She is smiling again. She  touches his shoulder. He turns with a start, then  smiles and captures her hands. He starts to pull  her to him, when she says:

20) 243) text: SEMI CLOSE UP OF CHRISTINE & RAOUL. Raoul is startled and looks at her stupidly, then  incredulously - then suspiciously. Christine does  not observe the reaction in him. She continues  more lightly than before.
20) 254) text: As Raoul pursues Christine to the Inn door where he grabs and detains her.
20) 257) text: As Raoul tries to placate Christine. He releases  his hold on her arm, whereupon she gives him an  angry look and without replying, enters the Inn door and slams it in his face. Raoul is chagrined and disappointed. He curses the luck  then moves away sadly.
20) 261) text: It is night of the same day. The play of light  and shadow makes a beautiful but depressing scene.  There is a stage background. At first, the heaven is filled with stars. Then as the full moon begins to rise over the horizon, the stars begin  to fade and long shadows creep out into the garden. Raoul is sitting in the little alcove just where  he was left. He is downcast and gloomy. His attention suddenly becomes centered. The door  opens - The door to the Inn and he arises. Slowly the door opens and Christine enters, dressed all in white. Her eyes are fixed and look into space. She  moves like one walking in her sleep. Raoul  who is in foreground, watches Christine exit with  growing suspicion. Then he follows her with  caution.
20) 264) text: This is a country graveyard beside a little church in Brittany and it must be so conceived that it  will seem reasonable to appear it joins the  garden. Skeletons and skulls by the hundreds are  heaped against the wall of the church. The full moon throws its light upon the scene.  Christine enters like a sleeping walker and picks her way amongst the graves. Raoul enters a short distance  behind and follows her at a distance. Christine  finally stops before a grave with a moss covered  headstone and kneels.

20) 281) text: He is startled and dismayed for he hears the  same strange melody that he had heard outside  Christine's dressing room door. Then as he  listens, his passion arises - in a jealous frenzy.
20) 285) text: Christine's face is radiant. She turns and winds  her way out of the graveyard and she is in the same  mood that she entered. Raoul's eyes follow Christine  for a second. Then again he begins to search for  the source of the music with his eyes. He  thinks he hears a noise in the direction of the bone  heap and he takes two or three steps in this  direction.
20) 330) text: The house is dark. The footlights are lit and  the orchestra is playing while the audience waits in suspense. The Curtain rises, disclosing Christine as Marguerite kneeling before the Shrine  in the Church.
20) 349) text: RAOUL'S fingers turn the card over impatiently,  revealing on the other side, Christine's answer.
21) 3) text: It is evident that Christine has finished her aria.  The audience is a tumult of applause.
22) 3) text: MED CLOSE UP RAOUL & PERSIAN  AMBER. The two men stop and look at each other, just for an instant, one look, but in that look the Persian expresses a friendly compassion for Raoul. The  Persian then passes on toward the stage; Raoul  looks after him. It strikes Raoul with sudden  force that perhaps this Persian is Christine's  Angel of Music. Raoul shows his suspicions and  again turns toward Christine's dressing room.
22) 6) text: Raoul raps at Christine's door. As there is no  response, he tries the knob. The door is unlocked  and he exits...into the dressing room.
22) 8) text: INT. CHRISTINE'S DRESSING ROOM   AMBER Raoul enters and finds a gas light burning but the room is empty.  He still holds the suspicion occasioned by his meeting with the Persian.  He  looks about the room angrily, then sits down  on the edge of the couch to wait.
22) 15) text: This is a very long shot. The curtains at the  corner are drawn back for a curtain call. Christine  Daae appears alone, a diminutive little figure  upon which thousands of eyes are focused. The  audience is giving her a great ovation. FULL FIGURE OF CHRISTINE.  IN CLOSE UP

22) 19) text: As Christine comes happily down the corridor,  her arms laden with flowers and accompanied  by a group of admiring ballet girls who shower  her with praise.
22) 20) text: INT. CHRISTINE'S DRESSING ROOM.
22) 21) text: Raoul looks about in a panic. Then he decides he will hide. He conceals himself in her closet just in time, for the door opens and Christine enters.  She waves good-bye to the ballet girls  and closing the door, crosses quietly to her  mirror, where she hugs the flowers happily.
22) 24) text: MED. CLOSE UP CHRISTINE...AMBER
22) 25) text: A strangeness has come over Christine. She raises her head in an attitude of listening. Her eyes seem to be fixed upon space.
22) 31) text: CLOSE UP OF CHRISTINE BEFORE MIRROR.
22) 35) text: BACK: The glass begins to quiver. A dozen images of Christine are seen, all quivering. Christine  herself is terrified. She gropes blindly at  a long white drape hanging beside the mirror. The terrified Christine disappears through the mirror  and is gone with the mirror hanging and the  torn drape with her.
22) 40) text: Christine finds herself in a gloomy passage  lighted by a single ray of light which comes  from some unseen source.  Christine clutches the  drapes - bewildered and terrified - but she does not cry out. She looks ahead of her in the direction of the improvised runway, but she does not look directly downward. Then she turns to the mysterious door thru which she has just  entered. Near her from below a long arm is extended into the scene. The fingers of the hand  are held close together, stiff and straight. The hand itself is not made up for a skeleton's hand,  but merely to suggest one slightly. Then, without  a step, the figure of Erick moves upward into  scene, without motion on his part as if he were  being lifted upon an elevator. Erick wears  a black mask covering his eyes and nose.  The  eyes seem to be two black holes. The part of  the face that is visible, the chin and the  mouth, is hideous. There is practically no  hair on the head. He is dressed all in black, his own peculiar fashion of evening clothes. The whole is covered by a long black cloak.
22) 41) text: Erick extends his hand and grasps Christine by the wrist. She stands motionless, burned to  stone, but does not turn her eyes upon him yet.
22) 46) text: BACK: Christine screams in sudden hysterical  terror and looks up into his face. She screams and begins to fight him hysterically. This  scene is played very rapidly.
22) 48) text: A LONGER SHOT.  FAINT GREEN This shot shows an improvised runway with the exit in the left f.g. In the b.g. can be seen the machinery of the mirror, the two counter-  pieces, etc. One of Erick's feet is still  resting upon one of the counterpieces to explain  how he came to be elevated into the picture.  He rode up upon the moving counterpiece.  Christine is fighting him hysterically. He takes  her bodily in his arms. The drape is partially  folded about her.
22) 50) text: CLOSE UP ERICK & CHRISTINE.  FAINT GREEN
22) 51) text: As Christine struggles and screams, Erick's  skeleton hand closes over her mouth. When her  horrified eyes catch sight of Erick's face  close to hers, she partially swoons but does not entirely lose consciousness. (This screaming is employed to key the scene down so that it can again be keyed up when Christine enters Erick's abode.)  There must be this transition here, because if Christine continues to oppose Erick, she would not sit willingly upon the white stallion nor row quietly in his arms in the boat.
22) 52) text: A LONGER SHOT. FAINT GREEN. Christine in his arms, Erick sweeps over the   improvised runway with her and exits to the left. The long drape is floating after them.
22) 55) text: Erick swoops in on the bridge from the right,  carrying Christine, the drape floating behind them. Christine is pliable in his arms, half in a swoon. Christine is reluctant. Erick exits with her to the left. The scene changes by employ- ing a traveling iris. As one picture irises out of one corner, the next simultaneously irises in another.  Thus there is not an instant of blank screen.  These irises should always travel in the direction of the action. (It is suggested that in each of these lapses, the fade-outs  be taken three ways, by lap dissolving, fading  and the moving iris.) INT. CELLAR BLANK CORRIDOR.   FAINT GREEN.  MOVING IRIS IN
22) 56) text: Caesar, the great white stallion is tethered here and beside him upon the floor is a lantern. With a gliding motion, Erick, Christine in his arms, moves to the horse. As he lifts her upon the horse's back, Christine mildly resists, but fixes herself upon the horse, and remains there.  Erick takes up the lantern and leads the horse out, the long drape making a picture.
22) 58) text: A distorted shadow of Christine upon the horse and Erick leading it. While the horse and Erick are walking the shadow does not move off the screen. The shadow stays in one spot.
22) 64) text: This shows diagonal runways leading from one  cellar to another. Erick leading the horse  carrying Christine, is in the middle cellar  of the three.  He leads the horse around the  turn and starts down the runway toward the  bottom cellar.  MOVING IRIS OUT.
22) 68) text: Erick enters leading horse. This is all in b.g. He places the light in the boat, takes Christine in his arms and as he does so, the horse exits as  if by habit. Erick steps into the boat with Christine and the drape. With his free hand, he takes a long pole and gives the boat one shove. He  glides toward the camera into the darkness, the  drape floating upon the water in its wake.
22) 70) text: This is the big lake shot. This shoots from the  light into the darkness. The boat glides in from  the darkness, the figure in it motionless. The  boat glides up to two or three stone steps before  a deep stone casemented door in the masonry on  the left. The boat comes to a stop before the  steps. Erick pulls a ring attached to a heavy  chain, hanging from a hole in the masonry. The heavy door swings open and Erick and Christine is lying in his arms as a flood of dazzling light shows she is in his arms limply and without any  movement of resistance. She is like one in a dream or  stupor. Erick carries her from the boat through  the door.
22) 80) text: Erick enters carrying Christine. He crosses the room to the high couch and gently places her upon it. He then returns to the door and closes it. Christine's stupor is giving way to astonishment and bewilderment. She begins to look at the strange room when Erick returns to her. She still is not sufficiently recovered from her stupor to be startled and shocked by Erick's approach. He observes her for an instant with folded arms in an attitude of humility.
22) 81) text: MED. CLOSE UP ERICK & CHRISTINE   AMBER Slowly Erick sinks to his knees upon a footstool.  He is most abject and humble.  He touches the  fold of her dress. He presses it to his breast  and then to his lips. Christine is watching him as one hypnotized.  Then she screams a sudden and terrified scream. She springs from the couch.
22) 84) text: In the center of the room Christine hesitates,  then wildly runs out through the door leading  to Erick's bed chamber. Without haste and in  humility, he moves after her.
22) 87) text: The walls and the low ceiling are hung in black.  In the middle of the room there is a canopy from which hangs curtains of red brocaded stuff.  Under this canopy there is an open coffin, an elaborate affair lined with wuffed silk.  It is fantastic but must look like a coffin - the lid is open.  When Christine enters the coffin is not seen.  She enters and stands frozen to the spot. Her  wildness gives way to a dumb terror. The  camera pans revealing the coffin and the canopy,  but keeping Christine in the scene.  Erick enters to her side in a quiet humble way.  Indicating  the coffin, he tells her in a matter-of-fact way:
22) 93) text: MED. CLOSE UP CHRISTINE AND ERICK. AMBER The shot cuts out the coffin. Christine's  terrified eyes are now fastened intently upon  Erick's face. The thought that has forced itself upon her, is a revelation to her. She  cries at him with loathing:
22) 97) text: BACK: Erick ignores this. He indicates toward  the coffin, "This is not a pleasant sight for you.  You had better go into the next room."  Christine here begins a transition. From the  positive, assuming attitude, one of hopelessness  and fear begins to envelope her. She begins  to tremble and without removing her eyes from  his face, backs into the drawing room.
22) 99) text: Christine enters from Erick's bed chamber to the center of the room. She is now a pathetic,  helpless little figure, hopeless, without under- standing of what is to happen to her and trembling  with fear.  Erick enters from his bedchamber and  goes to her with a humble stoop of the shoulders.  He stands before her an instant in an abject attitude.
22) 111) text: BACK: Christine is stunned by this knowledge for she recognizes the voice. She says angrily though frightened:
22) 123) text: Christine is terrified...she becomes hysterical  and sinking to her knees, pleads with him to  release her - to take her home.  Instead, Erik  gazes at her with folded arms and he says with tragic sadness:
22) 128) text: BACK: There is a movement of Christine's eyes, something to indicate terrible suspense...He  continues the title, humbly:
22) 132) text: BACK: Christine's hands go to her temples. She totters an instant - then swoons. As she falls, he catches her in his arms and allows her to  sink gently to the floor. He kneels beside her  and sways and moans and beats his chest and  groveling, he kisses the hem of her garment.  Slowly then Christine regains consciousness. She is at first terrified; then as he sees the  tragic outpouring of a sublime love, she can only  feel pity for the strange creature who weeps and  beats his breast. When Erik sees she is  conscious, he seizes her hands and covers them  with burning kisses. Christine draws away and says:
22) 144) text: INT. ERIK'S DRAWING ROOM. Christine sinks back with a hopeless sigh and  offers no resistance, when he tenderly picks her up in his arms.
22) 146) text: Erik takes Christine in his arms and carries  her into her bedroom.
22) 148) text: INT CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM...AMBER
22) 149) text: The room is dimly lighted and all that is seen is the dim outline of a bed and a door. This is an extraordinary bed, a something dramatic, something that does not exist. Erik enters with Christine and places her gently upon the bed. He stands for an instant in the doorway in silhouette and  looks at her, then exits and closes the door.  Christine arises to a sitting position.
22) 150) text: C.V. OF CHRISTINE.
22) 206) text: INT. ERICK'S MUSIC ROOM AMBER Erick is sitting at the organ in half silhouette,  playing the organ. There must be something weird  and wild in the picture. Perhaps some of the objects  surrounding him can lend to the effect. INT. CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM ....AMBER
22) 207) text: Christine is calm, hypnotized by the powerful music  she is hearing. She is marveling at the genius of this  man and is touched by his music.
22) 213) text: BACK: PRIZMA - Fascinated by the music, Christine opens the door and steps out into the drawing room.
22) 216) text: Upon the organ side rack is another thick manuscript  open. This is entitled "Don Juan Triumphant"  Upon the organ is a violin. Erick is seated upon an  elevated bench so that when Christine enters he will  be about as high as she is. Christine enters back  of Erick and stands spellbound in wonderment at the  music and at the man's genius. Erick senses her  presence there and plays all the more wildly.
22) 219) text: C.V. OF CHRISTINE'S FACE  awed and hypnotized by the fury in the voice and the  music.
22) 229) text: As Erick backs Christine against the wall and  towering over her, he screams:
22) 233) text: BACK: Erick moves closer to Christine as if he is  going to take her in his arms--she throws up her  hands to warn him off. This brings Christine to herself. Somethings has been revealed and it sha- dows the tone of the scene. Up to this moment Chris- tine had been hypnotized by his music. The spell  of the music now dispelled and she begins to look  at the man with curiosity and increasing antagonism--  then as his horrid face comes closer and closer, she  suddenly seizes the mask and tears it from his face-- then repelled against the wall with a scream of terror  and revulsion. Facing Christine is a death's head  that is alive with four black holes for its eyes,  nose and mouth, a skin pallid and yellow--Erick utters a terrible cry of grief, despair and rage, then towers  over her, hissing words and curses upon her.

Torn by uncontrolled hysteria, tears, she raises to him appealing and makes two steps forward, upon her knees, begging forgiveness for the terrible thing she has done. He is towering  over her with folded arms, his face slowly loosing his hideous grin and mourning convulsively as the tragedy of his love comes over him. Then he sobs piteously.

The staircase and galleries  are so filled up with people that it is almost a  jam--Although most of the people are costumed, many are in evening dress and wear opera masks.  It is a scene of noise, laughter and color, gaiety  and emotion. On the left side of the staircase,  where it takes a left angle turn, Raoul is walking.  He is masked in evening dress and wears a black  costume. Christine is presumably on her way down  the left staircase. She is dressed in modest  evening dress and is masked.

If a person were coming  down these stairs, their lower extremities would be  seen some time before the full figure. In the f.g.  there is a door covered with a portierre. Immediately  beyond this portierre is a full sized mirror. There  is a door and number of other exits. Raoul and  Christine enter from below. She has Raoul by the arm  and almost drags him along.

Christine has been so  engrossed in her terrible story that she has not  understood his attitude. She is shocked now as an  understanding of Raoul's suspicions comes to her.  Her lips tremble and she feels helpless and alone.  She is almost at the point of tears. She tries to get  his eyes but he averts them. She touches him upon  the arm and speaks with appeal:

The Persian jumps from the stool, grasps Raoul by the arm and moves him to the position in front of the  mirror. This shot is taken as at a different angle than  the mirror shot in which Christine disappeared so that  the audience will be let in on the trick nature of the  contrivance. The mirror opens and Raoul and the Persian  pass through it - that instant Philippe enters to catch a fleeting glimpse of Raoul as he vanishes thru the  mirror and it closes after him-- he hurries forward in dismay and feels the glass.

From this moment Erick becomes cruel and Christine combats him on the verge of hysterics.  He asks her in a quiet but very dangerous manner:
22) 892) text: Erick is now coming down the steps leading to the screened opening. Christine senses that Erick   has put into effect some of his cruel mechanisms.  She is becoming frantic in her attempt to carry  on her acting. Her composure is palpably nervous  and forced. Erick pantomimes for her to go up  and look thru the screen.

Christine runs up the  steps - draws aside the drapes and looks through the  screen.
22) 947) text: Christine is looking through the screen. She turns  upon Erick, maddened. She runs down the steps to him. She first reviles him - then hysterically appeals to him. He grasps her by the wrist with such unconscious force that it brings her to her knees. He cries  at her:

Christine is groggy - she has the intention  of telling Erick, "Take me!" but her emotions have exhausted her. She is almost out of her mind. Her eyes are wild and she sways groggily, staggers to the  couch and sinks down upon it. Erick bends over her in an ecstasy. He bends within a short distance of her white face and tells her: "You are as beautiful as if you were dead!" Erick continues along the same line.

There is a lightning  transition in his manner. Pointing at her, he hurls  the final threat:
