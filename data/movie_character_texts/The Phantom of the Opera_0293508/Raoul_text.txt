He is downcast and gloomy. His attention suddenly becomes centered. The door  opens - The door to the Inn and he arises. Slowly the door opens and Christine enters, dressed all in white. Her eyes are fixed and look into space. She  moves like one walking in her sleep. Raoul  who is in foreground, watches Christine exit with  growing suspicion. Then he follows her with  caution.
20) 264) text: This is a country graveyard beside a little church in Brittany and it must be so conceived that it  will seem reasonable to appear it joins the  garden.

22) 360) text: This is an overhead corridor. A flight of stairs in the f.g. leads from below. In the b.g. is a single  staircase leading upward. The entrance to the stair  case is a high area, almost into the top of the ceiling  so that the camera while taking in the people looks a  long distance up the stairs. If a person were coming  down these stairs, their lower extremities would be  seen some time before the full figure. In the f.g.  there is a door covered with a portierre. Immediately  beyond this portierre is a full sized mirror. There  is a door and number of other exits. Raoul and  Christine enter from below. She has Raoul by the arm  and almost drags him along.

Christine is thrown into near  hysterics. She clutches at Raoul's arm. He now has one foot upon the stairs. He is drawing away from  her and in so doing he pulls her to her knees.  Pleading she cries at him.
22) 380) text: BACK:  Raoul undergoes a complete transition. What  she has said hits him violently and with great weight.  He sees her before him a helpless pathetic little  figure.

22) 437) text: BACK: Raoul is moody and depressed. He is keeping his eyes averted. Where one might expect to see anger there is none. Raoul is burning up inside with jealousy - guilty jealousy. Christine has been so  engrossed in her terrible story that she has not  understood his attitude. She is shocked now as an  understanding of Raoul's suspicions comes to her.  Her lips tremble and she feels helpless and alone.  She is almost at the point of tears. She tries to get  his eyes but he averts them. She touches him upon  the arm and speaks with appeal:

He frets over his hopeless position.  Then a guard arrives in the corridor outside with  Philippe and the latter is admitted to Raoul's cell. The two brothers face each other coldly then Raoul arises and turning his back on his brother looks  out of the window of his cell. Philippe's face  softens and turning he shows he loves his brother  devotedly and is sincere in what he has done to thwart Raoul's love affair with Christine.

22) 636) text: From stage door. As Raoul and Philippe come out of box - as they come into f.g. Raoul stops and grabbing Philippe's arm says:
22) 643) text: BACK: Philippe nods agreement and exits back past box, toward rear of opera house, while Raoul plunges on  past camera.
22) 648) text: Attendants of the opera and a gathering of ballet  girls are discovered excitedly discussing the  mysterious happening. Some are looking into  Christine's dressing room with awed curiosity.  Raoul enters from the direction of the stage and  like a madman hurries toward Christine's dressing  room. As he nears the door those who are peering  into the room fall back. An instant before Raoul  exits into the room the Persian enters to corridor  from cellar. He catches sight of Raoul and glides  swiftly after him.
22) 651) text: Raoul enters and finds the room empty. Raoul is  filled with oaths and insults. He pounds upon the  mirror with his hand, as if he were challenging the  phantom behind it.  The Persian enters swiftly and  closes the door but does not lock it. From this  moment the Persian takes command. His movements are  definite and direct. He indicates in an authoritative  way for Raoul to calm himself and tells him:
22) 655) text: BACK: The Persian faces Raoul in a manner deliberate and cold though not unfriendly -- Raoul is dis- pleased by his interruption and he says angrily:     
22) 660) text: BACK: The Persian commands Raoul with his eyes and there is a pause. He tells him coldly and  without excitement:

22) 673) text: BACK: Raoul is horrified yet fascinated - he begs the oth to continue - the Persian does so. The Persian pauses. Raoul is filled with horror - the Persian continues:
22) 681) text: Raoul can stand no more - his fears for Christine's safety have become a frenzy - he pleads for the  Persian to help him do something - the Persian  surveys him calmly, then he drops to his knees and begins feeling along the baseboard for the  hidden control of the trick mirror.
22) 685) text: INT CHRISTINE'S DRESSING ROOM   AMBER The Persian is now standing upon a stool and  is running his fingers along the picture molding.  He indicates to Raoul that he has found what he  is looking for. He pulls at the molding and a section of it comes out, lever-like, revealing a steel draw bar behind it. The Persian jumps from the stool, grasps Raoul by the arm and moves him to the position in front of the  mirror. This shot is taken as at a different angle than  the mirror shot in which Christine disappeared so that  the audience will be let in on the trick nature of the  contrivance. The mirror opens and Raoul and the Persian  pass through it - that instant Philippe enters to catch a fleeting glimpse of Raoul as he vanishes thru the  mirror and it closes after him-- he hurries forward in dismay and feels the glass.
22) 688) text: Raoul and the Persian are discovered back of mirror.  The Persian motions Raoul to do exactly as he tells him. He pantomimes to Raoul to hold up his hand, Raoul is mystified as to the reason for this but obeys. The Persian tells Raoul hurriedly:

Philippe stares after them angrily, then attacks the mirror with the butt of his pistol. INT ROI DE LAHORE SET.  FAINT GREEN
22) 700) text: Two shadows are seen on the wall where the shadow of Joseph Buquet's figure was seen. It is Raoul and the  Persian approaching from the right, holding up their  hands. They enter and Raoul follows the Persian to a little cupboard fastened to the wall. The cupboard contains an emergency outfit consisting of a dark lantern, a hatchet, an ax, a saw and a coil of rope. The cupboard door is removed by the Persian who takes the lantern and lights it.
22) 702) text: MED CLOSE UP OF RAOUL AND THE PERSIAN FAINT GREEN.
22) 703) text: The mystery is now upon Raoul as it was upon Christine. He would like to help but he senses his total helplessness. Raoul drops his hand. The Persian  turns on him and tells him in a startled way:
22) 709) text: Raoul is puzzled and senses his dependency. He  raises his hand. The Persian moves quickly followed by Raoul to a pin rail in the left b.g.  With some effort the Persian twists one of these large pins. As he does a trap opens in the floor in the identical spot where the body of Joseph  Buquet was found. The Persian and Raoul go to the  open trap and the Persian flashes on the lantern  and indicates for Raoul to hold him by the wrists  and drop him - Raoul holds the Persian by the wrists  and drops him - (This scene will be more effective  if played in semi-darkness)
22) 711) text: INT CORRIDOR LOOKING AT BLANK WALL  FAINT GREEN  (This blank wall can be doubled for another location) This source of light here is the Persian's lantern. Couple of counter poise weights are hanging from above.  The Persian falls into the scene and lights on his feet. Raoul drops in after him.  The Persian pulls the counter-poise weight.
22) 716) text: Raoul and Persian exit - guided by the rays from the dark lantern.
22) 721) text: Raoul and the Persian enter - They look off and stop  -both transfixed with terror - They flatten themselves  against the wall as the Persian makes his lantern  dark. A fiery face - not more than three feet from  the ground approaches, a red handkerchief - Handschiegel  Process - is around the neck giving the impression  that it is a decapitated head. When the terrible  face reaches a point opposite Raoul and the Persian it cries out at them:
22) 727) text: BACK: The face exits. The light upon the face is  caused by a dark lantern which the rat catcher holds  turned upon himself. The Persian turns on his lantern  and he and Raoul exit, looking back with terrified  eyes, their right hands up in the air.
22) 753) text: INT LAST CELLAR  FAINT GREEN This is a low massive chamber. It is almost at the  bottom of the opera foundations, leading from it is a long narrow corridor, wide enough only for two  men to walk abreast. This first shot does not reveal  the narrow corridor. Raoul and the Persian enter.  The Persian stops and listens. Raoul tiredly lets  down his right hand. In a startled way, the Persian  grabs Raoul's wrist and raises his right arm for  him, with a certain horror in his look.
22) 758) text: BACK: Raoul is henceforth careful to keep his hand  raised. They exit. The Persian with increased caution.
22) 761) text: Raoul and Persian enter - The Persian again stops  and listens - Then he whispers to Raoul.
22) 764) text: BACK: The Persian cautions Raoul to move quietly. They reach a point just inside the corridor. Without any anticipation a trap gives under their feet and they shoot downwards out of the picture.  The picture is held on an instant and the trap closed.
22) 768) text: There is no effect of a reflected forest until  Erick turns on the overhead lights. The dark lantern  would not cause those multiple reflections. The  Persian gets to his feet, turns lantern to  mirrors and feels them. Then examines iron tree and lasso - turns to Raoul, recovering from fall and says:
22) 773) text: BACK: Raoul's reaction is horror. Suddenly both men  are startled and look up and to the right. They  hear Erick's voice. Raoul is thrown into great  terror and opens his mouth to cry out but the Persian  grabs Raoul and puts his hand over Raoul's mouth.
22) 801) text: BACK: Christine's first reaction is one of relief. Help is at hand. Then almost instantly she is thrown into anguish. Her lips form the name "Raoul"  Erick studies her for an instant and then moves out. Swiftly.
22) 818) text: Raoul and the Persian are listening to make sure  that Erick has gone, then, before the Persian can  stop him, Raoul cries out "Christine! Christine!  It is I, Raoul!"
22) 820) text: INT ERICK'S LIVING ROOM...AMBER CLOSE UP CHRISTINE LASHED TO THE CENTER PILLAR  Christine hears Raoul's agonized cry, answers it  and gives away to fear for Raoul. INT TORTURE CHAMBER...FAINT GREEN.
22) 821) text: Raoul is crying out - wild inarticulate things  to Christine - The Persian grasps him by the  wrist and sternly indicates for him to keep  quiet. The Persian addresses himself toward  the overhead window:
22) 829) text: This is medium closeup of Philippe at the boat landing. Philippe is kneeling, holding up the lantern, peering into the darkness. He shouts Raoul's name. Unseen by Philippe and directly in front of him there is a dis- turbance in the water. The reed-like tube glides in making a V-shaped line of ripples. Then Erick's long arm shoots out of the water and grasps Philippe's wrist of the hand that holds the lantern, and the scene is plunged into darkness.
22) 837) text: The Persian is listening to Christine intently.  At the same time he is forcing Raoul to be quiet.  The Persian tells Christine:
22) 846) text: Christine is looking at the sounding device.  With dread anticipation she senses that Erick  is returning. She flies back to the center  pillar and slips under the throw. She is now  apparently in the position that Erick left her.  From this moment Christine begins to act a  double role. She is now matching her wits against  Erick's...Above all things she must keep Raoul's  presence in the torture chamber from Erick.
22) 875) text: Raoul and the Persian are listening at a great tension. Raoul gives an unexpected cry of rage - This startles  the Persian, who indicates with certain horror,  "He has heard you!"
22) 878) text: Erick is listening. He has heard Raoul's cry of rage.  He now understands why Christine wanted the keys.  He also knows that only for Raoul would Christine  do as she has. From this moment Erick becomes cruel and Christine combats him on the verge of hysterics.  He asks her in a quiet but very dangerous manner:
22) 890) text: INT TORTURE CHAMBER  FAINT GREEN From semi-darkness the chamber is flooded with  a brilliant, dazzling light from overhead.  Under the overhead light the single iron tree  is multiplied into thousands of trees, into a forest. Raoul's reaction is astonishment, be- wilderment, the Persian's horror - for he knows  what this means. The torture has begun. The  sudden flood of brilliant light causes them to blink.  Then Raoul tries to hide his eyes from the brilliant,  blinding light. The Persian now realizes the necessity  of searching for the secret spring which he knows  to be in the floor. Excitedly he begins to feel over  the floor with the tips of his fingers, to feel the  joints in the glass. Raoul watches him in excited  bewilderment. This is a short scene.
22) 903) text: He holds her with his hollow eye.  The terrible realization comes over her that Erick knows that  Raoul is in the torture Chamber. In a helpless  automatic way, knows that he knows she is lying. She repeats "No! No! Nobody is there!"
22) 905) text: The heat in the chamber has now become intense.  Both men are perspiring profusely. Excitement  approaching panic is overtaking the Persian  as he continues his search for the secret spring.  They are mopping their faces with their handker- chiefs. Raoul tears off his collar and flings it from him. He wants air. He begins to beat at  the mirrors with his fists and the Persian shows  his apprehension for Raoul. He tries to quiet  Raoul.
22) 922) text: Christine is in the position now that one false  step will cause Raoul's death. If Erick makes love  to her she cannot tell him flatly "No"  Therefore she continues her acting, depending upon  evasions. At the same time she is in trembling  and fear for Raoul. What is being done to him?  Erick is frenzied and insistent. Christine is hard  pressed. He follows her into a corner and is telling  her with frenzied pain:
22) 933) text: The two men are undergoing terrible torture. They are almost burning up. Their coats are off and their shirts have been torn open at the neck. They are drenched with perspiration. Raoul is be- coming delirious. The Persian himself almost crazy and is mechanically searching for the secret spring. If the forest from the reflected iron trap is seen here, it is just as it was when first seen. A terrible hallucination begins to overtake Raoul and with startling eyes he begins to crawl away from the section of mirrors into which he is looking. CLOSE UP RAOUL  AMBER
22) 939) text: It leaps up to the immediate f.g. and roars, as if at Raoul.
22) 940) text: CLOSE UP RAOUL  AMBER
22) 941) text: He gives a cry of terror and of fear, as if his  heart would break. A LONGER SHOT  AMBER   The Persian is startled at this cry and his eye follows the direction of Raoul's eyes. But the forest is just as it was before, a reflection of the     single iron tree.  INT. ERICK'S LIVING ROOM   AMBER
22) 942) text: Christine is frantic. She is listening to Raoul's  agonized cries. She is beside herself. She moans  and clutches at his cloak, crying, "What are you  doing to him! What are you doing to him!" With a  sweeping motion Erick points to the screened opening  indicating, "Go and see!"  Christine runs up the  steps - draws aside the drapes and looks through the  screen.
22) 944) text: INT TORTURE CHAMBER. AMBER  FLASH CLOSE UP OF RAOUL IN AGONY
22) 953) text: Her first reaction is one of repulsion and anger. This almost instantly gives way to the thought of sacrifice - to sacrifice herself to save Raoul.  However, the scene is out before she comes to any  decision.  INT TORTURE CHAMBER  AMBER
22) 954) text: The Persian is fighting to keep away the delirium. He is more undecided now in his search for the secret spring. Raoul has undergone a transition.
22) 955) text: CLOSE UP RAOUL  AMBER His face lights up wildly - there is hope - "Water?  Water! Water!"
22) 956) text: SHOOTING INTO SECTION OF MIRROR  AMBER. The scene is changed to a beautiful cool water fall in a shady forest. The water falls into a shady pool  then runs between grassy banks to the very floor of the torture chamber. Raoul crawls into the picture. He bends over thirstily and just before he reaches the Water, within six inches of the water, he is  stopped by the glass. He puts his hand to his throat  and begins to choke.  EXT. REAR OF OPERA  BLUE
22) 973) text: Raoul is lying upon the floor, panting, exhausted,  crazed. The Persian, who himself is beginning to  grow wild, is feeling aimlessly about the floor for  the hidden spring. His finger touches something  that gives, a nail head, which slightly protrudes  above the floor...which responds to his touch.  In his semi-delirium, he cries out in exultation.
22) 977) text: The Persian is crying out in mad exultation that he  has found it. - But Raoul is too far gone to hear him. The Persian takes the nail head between his fingers  and pulls it up about an inch. There is an instant of suspense in which nothing transpires. Then a  section of the floor about three by five, falls about  two inches. -then slides away horizontally, and  reveals a wooden stair leading downward. The Persian    inhales the cool air from below, then drags Raoul to the opening. Raoul drinks of the cool air as if water.

INT TORTURE CHAMBER   AMBER The cool air has revived Raoul and his senses have returned to him. The Persian holds his dark lantern  in his hand and is urging Raoul to follow him down- ward. They exit down the steps. The steps leading downward go off in the direction of Erick's living room.
22) 988) text: The source of light is from the torture chamber.  The location of cellar is directly under Erick's  living room. A set of wooden steps lead up to  a trap opening in the floor of the living room.  This is a very low cellar and enough barrels of  all sizes are stacked about to give the appearance  of a big wine cellar. The ceiling of this cellar  is necessary for the action. The Persian, carrying  his dark lantern, and Raoul enter down the stairway  leading from the torture chamber. They are looking  back apprehensively because a grating of heavy  bars descends behind them, cutting off their retreat  to the torture chamber, and by no action of their  own. While they are most dying of thirst, they  still are mystified at the great number of barrels.  They run to the barrels and each kneels at the one  he has chosen. They kneel and begin to pull at  the bungs, long enough to take hold of and pull out.

22) 1002) text: The Persian pulls the bung stopper of his barrel  and the same black powder flows into his hand. He  looks at the material in horror, empties it out of  his hand and removes the lantern to a safe distance.  He then tells Raoul with dread:
22) 1007) text: BACK: Raoul is bewildered but the Persian flies into  action.
22) 1010) text: The Persian runs around the cellar experimenting  and examining it with his dark lantern. He is  followed by Raoul. They pause at the steps which  lead to Erick's voice above. They then go up the  steps as far as they can go and listen.
22) 1019) text: INT BOTTOM CELLAR FAINT GREEN CLOSE UP RAOUL & PERSIAN  Their lantern is upon the highest step. The two men are listening, their ears are close against the trap. They turn horrified eyes to each other. They understand that Erick will ignite the tons of  gunpowder.

22) 1068) text: Raoul and the Persian are hugging the trap.  The water is within two feet of the ceiling.  The barrels are floating around, the rats are  swimming for points of safety.
22) 1071) text: Erick is standing before her trembling from head to  feet. There is a resigned serenity about Christine.  She has sacrificed herself to save Raoul. INT CELLAR  CROSS SECTIONAL SHOT  AMBER
22) 1075) text: Erick is discovered as he was left, cringing before Christine, afraid. She lays a hand upon his shoulder  and reminds him of those whose cries for help  both can hear. Like a dog, Erick obeys her. He throws back a rug, revealing a trap door. This he throws open. Raoul and the Persian are discovered, half drowned in the water which has risen to within a few inches of the floor. The two men are so far gone that they are in do condition to engage Erick in battle.  Erick, aided by Christine, drags both of the men out  of the water. The trap is left open.
22) 1077) text: Raoul is still alive and conscious. He is saved.  Christine is calm and very sad. Erick steps back and tells the two men:
22) 1081) text: BACK: Raoul's eyes, dread and questioning, are upon Christine. Very quietly and sadly, she indicates  "Yes, it is true." Slowly the arm of the sounding  device rises, unseen by those in the picture and  falls with a clang. All are checked at this un-  suspected interruption. The arm continues falling.  INT ON LAKE  #1  AMBER The water has receded almost two feet. The action in these scenes is swift. Simon and Florine are standing on the spot where Philippe was strangled. Simon is beckoning the mob toward him. The first of  the mob is running down a runway thru a distant  arch. Spears and weapons are flourishing, torches flaring. As the first of the mob reaches the boat landing, the rest of the mob continues to bank up the background. A CLOSE SHOT OF FLORINE  AMBER The mob is behind him and no one is paying the least  attention to him. Simon is doing all of the talking.  Florine indicates "Follow me" Florine plants the  idea that he is going to jump into the water about  three feet deep. Florine jumps and lights stiff  legged in the water about six inches deep. (The  audience will think that he is going right out of  sight) Florine shows quick surprise "This is easy."  He beckons to the others, "Come in" - takes a step and disappears, shoots straight out of sight. Without any attempt to save himself. Still no one pays any  attention to his disappearance.
22) 1088) text: Raoul and the Persian are still upon the floor,  but are rapidly regaining their strength. Christine  is in misery, half in tears, explaining to him that  someday he will understand. Erick swiftly enters  from Christine's bedroom carrying a cloak. Erick  throws the cloak over her shoulders. He indicates  for Christine to come. She does not wish to but  she is willing to live up to her promise. She allows Erick to sweep her out of the room into his bedroom.  This is all very flat. Raoul is very weak but he will  fight for Christine. Raoul staggers to his feet.
22) 1092) text: The Persian staggers to his feet and goes toward  the door of the lake. Raoul drags himself towards  Erick's bedroom. Both men are very worn and weak.
22) 1094) text: The action here is swift. Erick jerks down one  of the black velvet drapes in the f.g. revealing  a door and a staircase leading upwards. The drape  that Erick jerks partly falls obliquely across  the coffin. The coffin is hidden from the entrance  view but not from the camera view. The moment the  door is opened, a draft comes down the stairs  corridor and causes all of the draperies in the  room to shimmer.
