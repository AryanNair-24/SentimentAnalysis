Some come up with elaborate choreographies, while others shake their bodies best they can. Many of them are in costumes, some with lights blinking, laser flash lights a other Disco toys. In the middle of the dance floor, Julia and Tony dance wi each other - no choreography here, just plain dancing and having fun.
