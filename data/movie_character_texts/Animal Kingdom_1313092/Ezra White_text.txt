72) 7) dialog: Good, OK. Now I want you to listen carefully to this. From now on, mate I don't want you saying anything. That means nothing at all. No 'I don't know'. No 'I was sleepy'. You just refuse to answer questions. You got that? By law these cunts can't make you say anything. You don't even have to give them your name. OK? It's very important. Don't let them push you around. Just sit there in silence. At least til I get there. Ezra takes a seat at the table with J.

84) 2) dialog: I dunno. It doesn't have a good feeling about it. Leckie ran the whole ‘yesterday you were very helpful’ routine. That was probably for my benefit, but I dunno. He’s a kid. Kids are stupid. They’re weak. He may think he’s doing the right thing but really his foot’s covered in dog shit and he’s got it stuck right in his mouth. I’m pretty surprised you’ve let him get anywhere near you to be honest. Pope is staring blankly at Darren.
