2) 44) dialog: Hey, Quick, you ain't no gangster, man. We're not...we're club owners. We run a dance hall. Being a punk has nothing to do with it.

Ain’t nothing cool about dying young, Quick. You know who’s cool? An 89 year old motherfucker who dies in his sleep with all his children and grandchildren around him. That’s the cool one. I'd rather die a happy 89 year old punk than be a dead tough 27 year old. I won’t let you do that to yourself. And I’m not gonna let you do that to me. ‘Cause I wanna be 89 one day and I won’t make it if he kills you. They’1l have to kill me too, ‘cause I’m killing hin.
