15) 1) dialog: Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.

HAROLD NIXON (23) is doubled over the railing, a long string of bloody mucus hanging from his lips.  He is shockingly emaciated -- the last stages of tuberculosis.  HANNAH NIXON, in background attending TWO OTHER PATIENTS, looks on at Harold. RICHARD (19) hurries out of the cabin with a cotton cloth He holds Harold until he stops heaving.  Then, he wipes h mouth.

HAROLD holding ARTHUR.  RICHARD stares glumly at the came between HANNAH and FRANK. GENERAL HAIG, with KISSINGER behind, approaches with some papers held out in his hand.  Nixon sees them, turns down the hi-fi.
115) 2) text: IMAGES of FRANK and HANNAH NIXON now arise in Nixon's consciousness -- a past he would never really connect his own life to.  As if it were a storybook, a fabled America that never was.  The MUSIC should, in a sense, accentuate this divorce of sentiment from reality.
116) 9) text: We end on an IMAGE OF YORBA LINDA, CALIFORNIA ... turn of the twentieth century where it began.  We focus on the faces of the early pioneers who settled the land -- we drift over the faces of HANNAH and FRANK, in their stern postures -- past the BROTHERS, including the two deceased ones ... to little RICHARD, eyes all aglow with the hopes of the new century.
