68) 15) dialog: -- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis? Renault countersigns the papers.
68) 18) dialog: I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

70) 6) dialog: But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
70) 8) dialog: (forcefully) She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
70) 11) dialog: Here it is. Rick hands the letters to Laszlo.
70) 16) dialog: You better hurry, or you'll miss that plane. Rick watches as Ilsa and Laszlo walk very deliberately towards the plane.

70) 40) dialog: Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
70) 43) dialog: My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
