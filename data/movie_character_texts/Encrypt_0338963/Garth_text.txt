17) 87) dialog: You can stop calling him 'Mr.' now.
17) 89) dialog: Was he that good... or were you that good? Diana looks away angrily. Then:
17) 91) dialog: You're lying.
17) 93) dialog: He bought you. He bought you with a job and he bought you with a laser statue. You want me to believe he didn't buy the rest of you too?
17) 97) dialog: Vincent's not the kind of guy who doesn't get what he wants... unless...
17) 99) dialog: When you were diagnosed as terminal, did you get a second opinion?
17) 101) dialog: Not one of Vincent's doctors?
17) 103) dialog: He won you after all, didn't he? I mean, he got to keep you, young and beautiful, in his one-of-a-kind supercomputer... never to grow old... never to die... immortal and his, forever...

17) 114) dialog: (working) Uncommon. For the CIA.
17) 116) dialog: I'd argue the point... but it doesn't really matter anymore, now does it? Diana allows the vitriol to recede. Then: (CONTINUED )
17) 120) dialog: John, is it? I hadn't realized we'd become so chummy.

17) 126) dialog: Bullshit.
17) 128) dialog: (returning to work) Bullshit.
17) 132) dialog: You're lying... First, your defense mechanisms were designed to deal with terrorists — plural — more than one. They're set to activate individually, as needed. That's why you didn't send them all at once... Second, you'd say anything — do anything — to keep me from going down there. Am I right? Garth gathers his equipment, turns away from the elevator
17) 134) dialog: That elevator opened too easily... and you control it.
17) 137) dialog: hefts his equipment, enters.
17) 140) dialog: swings the door open with the barrel of his pulse rifle, revealing:
17) 148) dialog: Vincent certainly knew how to live, didn't he? Diana says nothing, but her image follows him.
17) 149) dialog: Where'd he sleep? Diana gestures: Over there.
17) 153) dialog: When you have this kind of money... this kind of power... I guess you can have anything you want.
17) 155) dialog: You didn't pose for this one too? Coital cries erupt from them. (CONTINUED )
17) 159) dialog: She looks a little like you... here and there.
17) 161) dialog: (gesturing other statuary) Who were all these people?
17) 163) dialog: The man in the sculpture... that was Vincent?
17) 165) dialog: For a woman who's spent the last twenty years inhabiting this place, you don't seem to know a lot about it.
17) 167) dialog: Why not?
17) 169) dialog: Yours... or Vincent's? (CONTINUED )
17) 181) dialog: If you're so concerned about my welfare, then tell me how to protect myself against this machine.
17) 185) dialog: Why should you care so much about me?

17) 209) dialog: Are there any more where he came from? Diana looks at the carnage a moment before:
17) 211) dialog: Then I've defeated every security device?
17) 223) dialog: You're on my side now, is that the idea?
17) 225) dialog: Vincent was supposedly on the verge of a discovery that would return the earth to its original weather pattern. Do you know anything about that? No.

17) 228) dialog: Can you access the computer?
17) 230) dialog: Look. Diana's eyes shut. When they open: (CONTINUED )
17) 234) dialog: Can you decrypt them? Diana would rather not answer the question. She's obfuscating:
17) 236) dialog: Maybe I can...
17) 252) dialog: Vincent? Yes.
17) 253) dialog: Tell me what happened. Tears well in her eyes. She fights them.
17) 255) dialog: Why? Diana looks away. Moments fall like broken glass to the floor.
17) 256) dialog: (a shout)
17) 281) dialog: You didn't murder him... You protected yourself. Justifiable homicide. Diana listens. She's not so sure.
17) 283) dialog: What?
17) 285) dialog: That was the plan from the beginning... Show me how to access Vincent's files.
17) 291) dialog: Do any of these names mean anything to you?
17) 293) dialog: Search for what?
17) 299) dialog: Here we go. Diana looks over his shoulder.
17) 302) dialog: 
17) 303) dialog: What's Praetor?
17) 323) dialog: Diana...
17) 325) dialog: You took your revenge on him.
17) 342) dialog: What? What something?
17) 345) dialog: What do you mean you've never seen it before? Diana has no answer.
17) 346) dialog: Where?
17) 351) dialog: What does it look like?
17) 353) dialog: Let me see it. Diana sends the video feed to a monitor.
17) 356) dialog: It's a man. Suddenly the creature TRANSMORPHS into something ghastly inhuman, and reforms as a man.
17) 357) dialog: Vincent has another weapons system, one you don't know about.
17) 366) dialog: Diana? (CONTINUED )
17) 386) dialog: I watched on the monitor.
17) 389) dialog: Did he release the seeds?
17) 397) dialog: The federal government collapsed before it could respond... Why didn't he release them? Diana doesn't say.
17) 398) dialog: (a shout)
17) 401) dialog: He allowed the world to be destroyed... because he wasn't paid? Diana's expression almost asks: He allowed me to die, did he?
17) 403) dialog: Maybe there's something wrong with the seeds. Check his data.
17) 405) dialog: I DON'T CARE!... Check the files. Diana's eyes close. The HUM of the great computer's synap circuits fills the room. ON THE PROJECTED SCREEN, file na stream down at an unreadable rate. Graphs, blueprints, representations of the new plant's DNA flicker into and o of existence. Then: (CONTINUED )
17) 409) dialog: Release the seeds! Now!
17) 411) dialog: I'll do it! Show me how! Diana pulls her gaze away from the door just as its color begins to change.
17) 415) dialog: It was Vincent! But Diana sees this awful creature for what it is.
17) 419) dialog: Diana — stairs to the roof?

17) 423) dialog: Just do it! Diana gestures assent. They share a brief moment eye-to-e then Garth turns and rushes for the far reaches of the hu room.
17) 425) dialog: slides to a stop beside the door, twists its knob, finds locked and jams his survival knife deep into the wood of jamb. It splinters. Garth rises and slams through the door.
17) 436) dialog: (radio) Reich, come in.

19) 9) dialog: The last defensive device is coming up those stairs right now. Send your people to take care of it.
19) 14) dialog: You were right. Vincent developed a way to fix the weather. I'm setting the timers that will blow the roof and seed the incoming storm. Reich thinks about this a moment.
21) 0) text: Reich watches Garth type in '5:00' in the timer.
21) 2) dialog: Of course I'm going to activate it. (CONTINUED )

22) 9) text: surges through the door. Diana snaps around to look, as does Garth. The creature too is not what it once was. The beast fight retain its form and motion, but moves forward. Garth tries to crawl faster, but can't. DIANA DISAPPEARS from the computer, and REAPPEARS at the robot. Standing on its top, she directs it to turn around The remaining track spins the machine around. Garth forces himself to go faster. (CONTINUED )
