16) 68) dialog: Do you know?
16) 70) dialog: Yes, some people say that... It may even be true... But the Mr. Vincent I know loves art more than anything else in the world. He built this residence so that someday it can be converted into a museum.
16) 74) dialog: (laughs) I'm not sure he would appreciate that... but you're right... someday this magnificent building will be like the Getty, a museum for everyone to visit. Today you're very lucky children, because I'm going to show you what most kids don't get a chance to see — the Vincent treasures. The children chortle their anticipation. The PROJECTION G DARK.

16) 214) dialog: It doesn't work like that. (CONTINUED )
16) 218) dialog: Yes, but... the defensive equipment is linked to my autonomic nervous system. I can no more stop the defensive units than I can stop breathing.
16) 220) dialog: My mind works the same way as when... I was alive. That's why Mr. Vincent gave me this opportunity, to remain... alive... inside EnCrypt.
16) 225) dialog: study one another for a long moment before:

16) 229) dialog: Really, this whole question would be a moot point... if you just surrendered.

Garth's single free hand slams against the robot's metal skin, without effect. Garth pulls the survival knife, rams it into a crevice in robot body, jerks it, snapping off the tip of the blade. The robot turns with Garth's splayed body, moving for som dark destination. A last ditch effort, Garth slams the broken blade into on the paintings as they pass. The blade digs deep into the canvas and is dragged an inch before the robot halts.
17) 34) dialog: The National Security computer in Arlington, Virginia, is still up... Mr. Vincent has a key... The satellite communication system is still working. Garth cares about none of this. Seeing Elaine again is fa more important than anything Diana could say.

17) 53) dialog: No.
17) 55) dialog: Because I can't. I told you. The security devices are controlled through my autonomic nervous system. They are as automatic as breathing.
17) 57) dialog: No.
17) 59) dialog: Because I'm not here to be your doormat.
17) 61) dialog: So you say...
17) 68) dialog: Until what?
17) 72) dialog: John Garth... why are you going that way?
17) 77) dialog: This is the Gallery of Laser Carvings. Everything in here is very fragile. If a bullet were to hit a carving and cause a short...
17) 84) dialog: look up at the light carving.
17) 85) dialog: (unconvincing) I'm not ashamed of it. Garth drops his packs, circles the statue, saying nothing
17) 86) dialog: I was a graduate student at UCLA... Mr. Vincent was one of the pioneers of laser carving.
17) 88) dialog: (an outburst) I'll call him any damn thing I want!... (controlling herself) ... He pursued me to model for him. Finally, I relented.
17) 90) dialog: Mr. Vincent's interest in me... exceeded the professional. He was in love with me. I never returned the affection.
17) 92) dialog: What?
17) 94) dialog: You son of a bitch! (CONTINUED )
17) 98) dialog: Unless what? Garth considers not going on. But:
17) 100) dialog: Of course I got a second opinion!
17) 102) dialog: No! What are you implying?
17) 104) text: Diana charges Garth. Just as HER 3-D HAND WOULD MAKE CONT with his face, SHE DISAPPEARS.
17) 113) dialog: So you're a common burglar after all?
17) 115) dialog: Fair play's poster children.
17) 119) dialog: John, I don't want you to do this.
17) 121) dialog: (wryly) Well, you've seen me naked. I thought that would count for something.
17) 123) dialog: If you go downstairs... I can't protect you. Garth turns, gives her his full attention.
17) 125) dialog: You don't really think you've defeated all of our security systems by yourself, do you? What if I had sent them all at once?
17) 127) dialog: No. It's not... John, listen to me — downstairs is different. Mr. Vincent's residence is there, the computer room, the weapons storage bays... There's a stand-alone system down there, fully automated, a terrible killing machine that —
17) 129) dialog: It's called The Rook. It was designed to replace soldiers on the battlefield. It's dormant now, in a state of suspension, but as soon as your heat signature is read on the bottom floor, The Rook will activate and it will kill you. (CONTINUED )
17) 133) dialog: Where are you going?
17) 143) dialog: Don't do this. The moment you enter, The Rook will be activated. Garth snorts with disbelief and enters. Dazzling lights flash on the moment he crosses the thresh
17) 154) dialog: Mr. Vincent was known for his imagination. A quarter-sized statue of a nude man and woman in embrace stands near the bed. Garth touches it and the two come to life and begin to make love.
17) 158) dialog: (uncomfortable) Touch it again. Please. Taking a close look at the woman's body.
17) 160) dialog: (exasperated) Touch it again! Please! Garth touches the light statue and it returns to its point and freezes.
17) 162) dialog: Mr. Vincent had many lovers.
17) 164) dialog: No... maybe... I don't know! Please leave here! Now! I'1l do what I can to stop anything from happening to you, but you've got to get out of here now.
17) 166) dialog: I don't spend that much time in the residence.
17) 168) dialog: (turning away) Privacy. A matter of privacy.
17) 172) dialog: BOTH! You've got to go! Garth merely looks at her. DIANA DISAPPEARS .

17) 178) dialog: Damn it!
17) 180) dialog: The Rook is activated! It's coming! Garth observes her coolly for a moment. Then:
17) 182) dialog: I can't! I can just warn you to go! (CONTINUED )
17) 186) dialog: You're a human being, aren't you? You're alive. You can't appreciate life until you've lost it. The admission impacts Garth. He sits up.
17) 188) dialog: The Rook is a fully autonomous combat operative. Its body armor is five times more effective than the obsolete armor you wear. This model has been programmed to kill with its hands, to protect property. It will tear your head from your body.
17) 190) dialog: It has no weaknesses! A BOOM SOUNDS distantly.

The Rook enters the residence at full run, already target against Garth. Garth brings the rifle within his sights and BEGINS FIRIN full automatic. Boom-boom-boom-boom! The pulse BOLTS STRIKE THE ROOK with effect. The Rook leaps obstacles and continues forward with inexorable power. Garth's pulse rifle empties. The Rook hits Garth at full tilt, slaps the rifle away, shoves him back, fingers reaching for Garth's throat. Garth resists the creature's hands. His BODY ARMOR SPARKS it cycles toward depletion. Momentum carries Garth through the doorway and into the stairwell. The Rook pushes Garth into the wall, fingers encircling h neck, ARMOR SPARKING. Garth struggles to bring his hand containing the C-4 up. plastique falls. The compressive force of the Rook's hands begin to strang Garth through the armor. Garth struggles, reaching for the C-4 on the ground. It's inches away. The Rook's red eyes bore into Garth, programed hatred. Garth begins to gag. The shoebox scoots into the stairwell.

17) 212) dialog: In the residence, there was only this one... Garth steps past her.
17) 224) dialog: Is that all you've come to do, steal? Garth considers the question a moment.
17) 227) dialog: I'm not the computer. I just live in it... But no, I'm not aware of anything like that.
17) 229) dialog: There were things Mr. Vincent didn't want me to know... business secrets, accounting spreadsheets, his personal correspondence. Other things.
17) 233) dialog: Nothing about any research on weather. There are vast amounts of files that are encrypted.
17) 235) dialog: No... I can't.
17) 237) dialog: No. You wouldn't stand a chance. Let me take you to the earthquake supplies. There must be a ton of food. It's located in the subbasement. Garth realizes that she's holding back. He stands, gather his equipment.
17) 238) dialog: It's this way... But Garth strides out in the opposite direction, deeper i the residence.
17) 240) dialog: You're going the wrong way. Garth slams through the doors leading to a corridor. On the left, the armory, behind locked doors.
17) 243) dialog: You mustn't go in there. Garth ignores her.
17) 244) dialog: If you go in there you'll set off the final defensive system! Listen to me!

17) 254) dialog: I... murdered him.
17) 258) dialog: Over the months that he was a recluse here, he... changed. I know why now. He never told me about the collapse... out there. He never said, "Diana, the world is ending." I thought Mr. Vincent had accepted the fact that I wasn't attracted to him...
17) 260) dialog: Mr. Vincent, you asked for me? Vincent turns to look at her appraisingly, foot to head.
17) 262) dialog: Sir? Thoughts cascade through his mind and out onto his expression. Finally: (CONTINUED )
17) 266) dialog: Business clothes. As usual.
17) 268) dialog: Mr. Vincent, this wasn't part of our agreement. Vincent's fingers return to the keyboard. DIANA'S CLOTHES DISAPPEAR.
17) 270) dialog: I was a disembodied human being... Vincent could recreate me any way he wanted inside the computer... make me do things... make me feel things... Even so, it wasn't enough.
17) 273) dialog: Don't do this! You'll die!
17) 282) dialog: I'll help you get what you want, just... you have to promise me something.
17) 284) dialog: When you're done... you'll kill me. (on Garth's searching look:) I've been alone for twenty years. I can't stand to be alone any longer, so kill me.
17) 289) dialog: Put it palm down on the scanner. The system requires both the image and a DNA match. His DNA may be dusty, but it's there. Garth must twist Vincent's body out of the couch for the to reach the nearby scanner. A band of light reads the drawing.
17) 292) dialog: Do a 'Search.' These are Vincent's files. I can't do it for you. Garth faces the keyboard, types in SEARCH:

17) 321) dialog: There was nothing wrong with me... Diana looks over at Vincent's mummified cadaver, hand reaching out as if beckoning for her.
17) 322) dialog: You were right... You were right!
17) 324) dialog: He murdered me... I was a young woman. I wanted children. I wanted a life...

17) 408) dialog: According to the research, the new bio- engineered plant should work as advertised.
17) 410) dialog: John, the creature is just outside that door. Garth rushes the command console.
17) 412) dialog: I can't. It's a temporary device. Vincent didn't integrate it with the rest of the systems. You'll have to set it off manually, from the roof.
17) 416) dialog: No... Vincent must have used a subset of his own DNA to create it. Nothing that (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
