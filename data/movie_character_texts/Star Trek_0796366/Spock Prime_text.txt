168) 2) dialog: ... Jim?
168) 4) dialog: How did you find me--? Does Starfleet know of my presence?
168) 7) dialog: I have been... and always shall be... your friend.
168) 10) dialog: You are James T. Kirk. Your father is George, as is your brother. Your mother's name is Winona -- you were born in 2233 --
168) 14) dialog: ... I am Spock. One hundred and thirty years senior to the Vulcan you know.

169) 1) dialog: It's remarkably pleasing to see you again. (re: Vulcan) ... especially after the events of today.

170) 2) dialog: A star in Beta Quadrant will go supernova -- and like a cancer left untreated... it will grow... and destroy everything.
171) 0) text: Now we're seeing VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY -- where SIX VULC SCIENTISTS study a HOLOGRAM of this event -- the star's O its PATH OF DESTRUCTION -- and SPOCK PRIME is among them
171) 1) dialog: I saw the beginning of it myself. Vulcan Science Academy devised a plan to stop it.
172) 2) dialog: We built a ship containing a material capable of generating the only thing powerful enough to consume a supernova. A black hole.
173) 1) dialog: I agreed to pilot the ship. Knowing I would not return.
173) 2) text: 164   Now we see Spock Prime, in a ritual ceremony of a V Kamikaze pilot. Tea, sipped inside the Ark --
173) 3) dialog: My sacrifice, in service of all races, seemed only logical.
173) 4) text: Now Spock Prime sits in the Jellyfish COCKPIT --
173) 5) dialog: Unfortunately... before I could begin the mission... the supernova destroyed Romulus.
173) 9) dialog: Yes. He of course blamed us. Believed Vulcan allowed his planet to die. Which was hardly the case. Let me continue.
173) 10) dialog: This annoys me, I don't like      -- I know, I know, I'm it-- do we have to do it like     surprised to hear you c this--?                           -- allow me to finish. Spock Prime touches Kirk again and we go:
174) 1) dialog: Nero came after me. Determined to thwart my mission. If Romulus was allowed to die, he said... all planets should share its fate.
174) 4) dialog: I needed an exit. I knew if this mission failed... everyone, everywhere... would lose everything.
174) 5) text: Spock Prime LEAVES the cockpit --
175) 2) dialog: I realized: a large black hole could destroy the supernova. A smaller one... could be my escape. Could send me back in time, allowing me to complete my mission. So I created a black hole...

179) 3) text: LIGHT on Spock Prime's face goes away -- he and the Jelly are back in SPACE --
180) 1) dialog: Nero was waiting for me.
181) 0) text: KIRK INHALES, SHARPLY, having been there with Spock Prime to the two men, in a cave: Kirk stares at him... his mind spinning because now he believes him. The result is overwhelmingly emotional.
181) 1) dialog: Forgive me... emotional transference is an effect of the mind meld.
181) 4) dialog: "Cthia" is the stricture that binds our emotions... but few of us are that perfectly Vulcan.
181) 7) dialog: Yet remarkably, events within our timelines, characteristics, people... seem to overlap significantly. Tell me about the rest of the crew? Chekov-- Uhura --?
181) 9) dialog: -- Sulu --
181) 11) dialog: Dr. McCoy would assert our meeting here is not a matter of coincidence... but rather, indication of a higher purpose.
181) 13) dialog: Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream's way of attempting to mend itself. In both our histories, the same crew found its way onto the same ship in a time of ultimate crisis -- therein lies our advantage. (rises) We must go-- there's a Starfleet outpost not far from here.
181) 17) dialog: ... yes. You often spoke of him as your inspiration for joining starfleet. This is amazing for Kirk -- he looks off, trying to imagi life. Spock intuits what this means.
181) 18) dialog: You should know. He proudly lived to see you become captain of the Enterprise.
181) 20) dialog: A ship we must return you to as soon as possible.

185) 5) dialog: Are you the station chief?
185) 14) dialog: (re: the Officer) ... Fascinating.
185) 21) dialog: You're Montgomery Scott.
185) 26) dialog: You are in fact the Mr. Scott who postulated the theory of trans-warp beaming.
185) 31) dialog: What if I told you your trans-warp theory was correct? That it is indeed possible to beam onto a ship that is travelling at warp speed. And that you only required the correct field equation to recrystallize dilithium?
185) 33) dialog: The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr. Scott... is because you haven't discovered it yet. Kirk reacts. Scotty reacts -- is almost spooked -- sobers bit... really regards Spock Prime. Skeptical. Amused.
185) 37) dialog: Allow us access to your shuttle... and I will show you what a genius you actually are. Off Scotty, who can't help but be intrigued --
186) 4) text: Spock Prime steps aside:
186) 5) dialog: Your equation for achieving trans-warp beaming.
186) 8) dialog: Point of fact: it did occur to you. (he works the console) Extrapolating Enterprise's course --
186) 10) dialog: Now's your chance, Mr. Scott.
186) 15) dialog: Agreed: the aft engineering bay is your best option: a large space and no unpredictable airlocks --
186) 17) dialog: No, Jim. My destiny lies along a different path.
186) 18) dialog: Your destiny can wait -- he         (simply, strong) won't believe me, only you can   Under no circumstances c explain w--                      be made aware of my exis You must promise me this.
186) 20) dialog: Trust me. Above all. Jim, this is the one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero, you alone must take command of your ship.
186) 22) dialog: Preferably not. There is, however, Starfleet Regulation 619. (off Kirk's confusion)
186) 25) dialog: Jim.  I just lost my planet. I can tell you.  I am emotionally compromised. (then)
186) 31) dialog: A trick I learned from an old friend. Something strikes Kirk -- his eyes GLINT with revelation. responds enigmatically: a silent acknowledgment of what K must do to get the ship. He raises his hand in the legend Vulcan salute:

248) 6) dialog: There are so few Vulcans left.    We cannot afford to ignore each other.
248) 10) dialog: (beat, simply) Because you needed each other. Opposing yet complimentary opposites. It was that balance between us -- I should say you and Kirk -- that often made the impossible, possible.
248) 12) dialog: (no: his heart heavy) I'm in no position to pass judgment... my actions have robbed you of much. I could not also deprive you the revelation of all you can accomplish together... of a friendship that will define you both in ways you cannot yet realize.
248) 15) dialog: I inferred universe-ending paradoxes would ensue should he break his promise.
248) 17) dialog: I implied.
248) 19) dialog: An act of faith. One I hope you'll repeat in the future.
248) 24) dialog: And yet, you are in a unique position... you can be in two places at once.
