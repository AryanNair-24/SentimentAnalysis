5) 9) dialog: You said you'd take it serious                        * when I had serious evidence.                          *
5) 14) dialog: You've trusted my research before,                   * what's the problem now Ryan?                         *
5) 16) dialog: All I'm asking for is an hour.                       * That's all. Give me an hour and                      * if you still think I'm chasing                       * UFO's, I'll walk out and you'll                      * never hear another thing about                       * them.                                                *
9) 1) dialog: It's a pattern, like the currents of the ocean.
10) 1) dialog: Some people see money as the root of all evil, but to me it looks like a fingerprint. Whether we're talking about 19th century Korea, or 21st century Iraq, the game is the same. If you want to understand why certain things are happening, you have to understand the flow of money.
10) 4) dialog: You remember the Eulmi incident?                    *
10) 8) dialog: Ozunu. I think. I've been going through some of the original transcripts of the trial of Kunitomo Shigeaki. The prosecutor questioned him about a payment of 100 pounds of gold. Shigeaki answered that he didn't know what the prosecutor was talking about. The question was never brought up again. But what pinged for me was the amount- the exact same amount rumored to be paid to the Hattori Clan for the assassination of Lord Sanda.
10) 10) dialog: Exactly. I figure these clans are like a thousand years old. They probably don't change a lot.
10) 12) dialog: I started looking at international wire transfers, targeting banks in the regions of several high- profile assassinations and bingo-
10) 14) dialog: Minister Zhang. The day before the assassination $1,555,999.90 was transferred from the bank of Shanghai. The exact market value of one hundred pounds of gold.
10) 18) dialog: I thought you might say that so I checked how often this particular bank transferred that market equivalent to a hundred pounds of gold in the last three years.
10) 20) dialog: Not once. He sifts through the report.
10) 22) dialog: The clans are real, Ryan. They                          * steal children and turn them into                       * assassins. They've been doing it                        * for years and nobody's doing a                          * damn thing to stop them.                                *
10) 24) dialog: They're real Ryan. You can call them spooks, or assassins, or whatever you want if it makes you feel better, but they're out there. They're killing people and nobody is doing a damn thing to stop them.
14) 2) dialog: How long have you been here? And you can't say "zwei cola bitte"?
14) 4) dialog: Do you ever stop being a cop?
14) 8) dialog: Desire?
14) 12) dialog: I think so. Same template as before. The transfer was made the day before a multiple homicide in Osaka. The police and newspapers are calling it a gangland slaying.
14) 16) dialog: What about the bank audit?
14) 18) dialog: But you said you found something.
14) 26) dialog: What happened to him?
14) 28) dialog: Is he still alive?    We need to find him.
14) 30) dialog: You believe it now, don't you?
14) 33) dialog: Then why are you doing this?
16) 0) text: The apartment is dark as Mika ENTERS and turns on the lights. She looks the place over, then goes room to room, turning on every light in the place. The practiced way she does it makes it clear she does this every night. Satisfied she's alone, she goes into the bedroom to change.
17) 0) text: Mika is curled up in a chair and with KGB report. She turns a page and sees a photocopied drawing of a very intricate floor that we now recognize as the Nightingale Floor. She reads the caption beneath it.
17) 13) dialog: ...who are you? She stares at the fierce beauty of his face and touches the screen gently. 22Aa   INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - DAY CLOSE on a bed of nails; sixteen penny nails arranged in perfect rows pointing up, the sharp tips catching the light. As we REVEAL Raizo his breathing is rhythmic and deep, but this is really the first time we have heard him sound like he is straining. As we continue to WIDEN, we discover the reason for this: he is doing handstand push-ups. On the nails. Over and over, with little apparent effort. The hard edges and lines of his body catch the light, like the tips of the nails, as we HEAR:
19) 0) text: Mika is at her computer doing what she does best: intuitively sifting through interconnected threads of information. Searching through what is known about Ibu-Battuta, she discovers information concerning the lost chapters of the "Rihla," supposedly destroyed sometime in the 15th century. She remains immersed until a sound grows louder and louder. A vacuum cleaner. She checks the time. Very late. She looks up and finds two eyes watching her through the crack in her open door. Startled she gets up while the eyes quickly disappear. In the hallway, an older Asian man is pushing the vacuum cleaner.
19) 1) dialog: Excuse me? Excuse me? He shuts it off, turns to her.
19) 2) dialog: Where's Jona? He seems not to understand her.
19) 3) dialog: Jona.    The usual cleaner. Jona.
19) 5) dialog: Oh. Well, tell him I hope he feels better
19) 9) dialog: ...What?
19) 12) dialog: True...Thanks.
20) 0) text: Mika walks down the empty street, the sound of her heels slap against the stone buildings. The shadows seem to stalk her. She hears a faint sound like metal claws against glass. She stops and listens trying to see into the dark.
20) 1) dialog: ...is someone there?
23) 2) dialog: But why?
23) 4) dialog: What are you going to do?
23) 7) dialog: Did you find Sabatin yet?
23) 10) dialog: You did.
23) 12) dialog: How?
23) 14) dialog: They killed him.
23) 16) dialog: Was he married? Did he have a family?
23) 18) dialog: I know you Ryan, you would have checked.
23) 20) dialog: Still in Russia?
23) 22) dialog: Where?
23) 28) dialog: Like your father said...It's a consequence of consciousness often interpreted as desire.
23) 30) dialog: For the truth. He shakes his head, handing her the paper.

25) 1) dialog: Mrs. Sabatin?
25) 3) dialog: I'm with Europol. We spoke on the phone.
25) 7) dialog: Shoen.
25) 8) text: Mika enters.
26) 0) text: Sabatin and Mika sit across from each other. The house has the chill of loneliness. Tea has been set out between them.
26) 2) dialog: I found it...illuminating. Especially the references to the Rihla. Your husband quotes passages not found in Battuta's present manuscript.
26) 4) dialog: I understand the report caused some problems for him inside the KGB.
26) 10) dialog: What happened?
26) 29) dialog: Do you know what they talked about?
26) 31) dialog: Can I ask how he died? GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08     36.
29) 0) text: Raizo opens the envelope as he crosses the street. There's a square of paper inside, and a photograph. On the paper is a street address in Berlin. The photograph is a close-up of a woman's face... Mika.
30) 5) dialog: What're you --
30) 7) dialog: I did --
30) 11) dialog: ...I'm sorry, it was the only way                    * I could get the evidence.                            *
30) 13) dialog: What happened?
30) 19) dialog: (quietly) DNP.
30) 21) dialog: (quietly) Actually that would be DNFP --
30) 30) dialog: Most of this is from Sabatin. Copies of what I think are the lost chapters of the Rihle. I think it describes the original location of the Ozunu Clan but my 14th century Arabic is a little rusty.
30) 33) dialog: That's how it started. I made a mistake, mixed up the case code and they sent me that.
30) 36) dialog: Yeah. I know. I don't understand why they're fighting though. It could be a clan war.
30) 39) dialog: I'm sorry Ryan. You have to know I didn't mean for you to get in trouble...
30) 43) dialog: I just thought if this was real, if these clans were killing people, you know, it was our job to try to stop them.
30) 45) dialog: Isn't that what your dad would do?
30) 47) dialog: Look, I know I broke the rules. I'll explain what I did and accept the consequences.
32) 4) dialog: Excuse me? Who are you?
32) 9) dialog: ...A few cases.
32) 11) dialog: What?
32) 13) dialog: How do you know that?
32) 15) dialog: I...I'm not sure. We do have lunch together sometimes, usually when we're working-
32) 20) dialog: No...not right now.
32) 22) dialog: No why. Has Agent Maslow done something?
33) 0) text: It is later. The garage is a gyre of shadows.       Mika walks towards her car. The fluorescent light flickers and goes out.      She sta in the dark.
33) 1) dialog: Come on...you're kidding me.
34) 4) dialog: Fucking Christ, Ryan-
34) 6) dialog: Zabranski came to my office. Asking about you.
34) 9) dialog: What happened?
34) 11) dialog: What did he say?
36) 1) dialog: He took the materials?
36) 3) dialog: What are we going to do?
36) 5) dialog: No way-
36) 7) dialog: Ryan, I can't let you lose your job because of me-
36) 10) dialog: I've never even fired one of these.
36) 15) dialog: Ryan...
37) 0) text: Mika parks her car around the corner from the apartment building, gets out and starts down the street when she sees -- -- the apartment building and the one next door are dark. Candles and flashlights are visible in some of the apartment windows, a scattering of neighbors congregating outside. Mika approaches a NEIGHBOR.
37) 1) dialog: Hey....
37) 3) dialog: What happened?
37) 5) text: Mika looks up at the building, scared but not ready to believe that ninjas are responsible for everything. She pulls a tiny LED flashlight out of her bag and starts into the building.
37) 9) dialog: You're not the first person to give me that advice today....
39) 6) dialog: ...security camera in New York.                        * Recorded you fighting...one of                         * them.                                                  *

39) 18) dialog: ...you're from his clan ?                           * His nod is almost imperceptible.
39) 19) dialog: Then...why did you stop him?                        *
39) 24) dialog: Who?
39) 26) dialog: Does that mean what I think it means?
39) 28) dialog: Oh god.                                               * She looks for her gun.
39) 30) dialog: I don't have a lot of options okay. I once took a Tae Bo class, but that's the extent of my Kung Fu abilities.
39) 32) dialog: What?
39) 34) dialog: How did you know that?                                *

47) 0) text: Mika's car rushing past us.
48) 0) text: Raizo is silent.    Mika is driving.
48) 1) dialog: I'm going to have to make a phone call in order to get the manuscript.
48) 3) dialog: Where?
48) 5) dialog: You think they're following us?
48) 9) dialog: I don't see anything back there.
48) 11) dialog: Following our scent?    Like dogs?
48) 14) dialog: How do you know so much about them?
48) 16) dialog: You flunked out of ninja school or something?
52) 0) text: Mika speeds along the autobahn.
52) 1) dialog: Okay, if you're not going to say anything, do you mind if I talk? When I get nervous, it helps if I talk. He says nothing.
52) 2) dialog: My name is Mika by the way.
52) 6) dialog: Yeah, well usually if someone introduces themselves it is a convention that the other person does likewise.
52) 9) dialog: So, you were an orphan?
52) 11) dialog: Interesting nature verses nurture case study I imagine.
52) 13) dialog: If it's okay with you, I'll try to fill in some of the blanks. You must have been taken by the Ozunu clan, trained to be an assassin, but something happened and you decided to opt out of the program. I don't imagine this went over so well and since they're after me for just peeking through the keyhole, they must be after you in a major way. But you are also after them or you wouldn't have bothered going to Sabatin. Which I figure means you're searching for the location of The Orphanage because that's obviously the only information Battatu's book would have that you wouldn't already know.
52) 15) dialog: Yeah, I got some moves too. I'm pretty lethal with the research thing.
52) 19) dialog: But here's a question I can't answer: since you didn't know I went to Sabatin's, why did you save me?
53) 0) text: The shops are all closed, Mika's car crawls to a stop in the empty parking lot.
54) 1) dialog: I understand retail therapy as well as any girl but I think it's a little late.
54) 3) dialog: What? No! Size 34...`cept certain times of the month. He starts to leave then stops-
56) 2) dialog: No.
58) 3) dialog: Hey-
58) 5) dialog: Don't you know how to knock?
58) 7) dialog: ...okay right.
58) 11) dialog: ...I'm just a researcher. I'm really not equipped to deal with this...
58) 14) text: In the bedroom, Raizo is dressed in new clothes. He lights a cigarette as Mika come out struggling with the tightness of her new jeans.
58) 15) dialog: These are a little tight.
58) 17) dialog: European sizes...run a little small I guess.
58) 20) dialog: This is for my "scent"?
59) 1) dialog: Wow. They teach you that at ninja school?
59) 4) dialog: You're going to steal a car?
59) 9) dialog: In for a penny, in for a pounding.
61) 4) dialog: How much time?
61) 6) dialog: Jesus.
62) 1) dialog: Ryan, it's me.

62) 8) dialog: He's on our side, Ryan.   I trust him.
62) 10) dialog: I promised him the Battuta pages. Do you still have them?
62) 14) dialog: Can you meet us? In three hours?
62) 16) dialog: How bout the usual?
63) 0) text: Maslow waits, the red-tip of his cigarette glowing in the middle of his silhouette. Mika is leading.
63) 1) dialog: There he is.
63) 3) dialog: He's a good man. It's all right.
63) 8) dialog: Thanks to him.
63) 10) dialog: Done what?
63) 12) dialog: What?
63) 18) dialog: No!
63) 21) dialog: Raizo!   No!   This is wrong!
63) 24) dialog: What are you doing?
65) 11) dialog: Ryan, you know this is wrong!   It can't be legal! What is this place? Your own private Guantanamo?
65) 13) dialog: Ryan you're making a huge mistake!
65) 15) dialog: So two weeks ago, there's no such thing as a ninja and now every city in the world has a warrant for one?
65) 17) dialog: He's not the enemy.
65) 19) dialog: I'm not crazy.     This is!
65) 23) dialog: You're not listening to me!
66) 1) dialog: Damn it, Ryan, I -- -- but he holds a finger to his lips, indicating be quiet.
66) 3) dialog: They want him dead. He's been fighting them for years.
68) 0) text: Mika is standing behind the bars which slide open. She has a bottle of water, she looks at the two armed guards following her.
68) 1) dialog: Could you give us a moment?
68) 3) dialog: If he wanted to hurt me he could have done that a while ago.
68) 5) text: They stand near the door as Mika crosses to Raizo.
68) 6) dialog: Hi...you looked thirsty.
68) 8) dialog: I'm sorry...I didn't know about this.
68) 10) dialog: You do?
68) 15) dialog: How did you know that?
68) 17) dialog: You know about my heart?
68) 20) dialog: Listen, Maslow is on our side. He's going to try to help you.
68) 22) dialog: The Hanta Kirra?
69) 0) text: Mika rushes up to Maslow who is talking to the group of Europols.
69) 1) dialog: Ryan, can I talk to you?
69) 3) dialog: No sir. I just...I have reason to believe that a group of ninja may be on their way here.
69) 10) dialog: But the situation we discussed-
69) 12) dialog: We don't have time.
69) 14) dialog: They'll be here soon.
71) 0) text: The lights go out. Mika's eyes dart into the pitch, red emergency lights suddenly glowing ominously.
71) 1) dialog: Raizo--
72) 0) text: Mika charges into the holding area, the detail of men right at her heels.
72) 9) dialog: I don't have time for this shit. We have to move the prisoner.
72) 10) text: In the back of his cell, Raizo's head lifts at the sound of Mika's voice.
72) 18) dialog: Not without you.
74) 1) dialog: Fuck me... She watches as the men position themselves, pressing into the black of the corridor. Thumbs flick safeties to hot. A shriek pierces the silence, one of the agents suddenly jerked from his feet like a puppet on a string. They watch in IR as the agent falls to the ground in several pieces.
74) 4) dialog: Come on--come on-- Raizo's eyes narrow, the last of the Europol Agents butchered by shadows.
74) 8) dialog: Shh!
74) 11) dialog: Got it!
76) 0) text: Mika flies up the stairs taking the steps two at a time rounding the next flight-- A beam of light flashing weapons rattling suddenly trained on her.
76) 5) dialog: Jesus Ryan--
76) 8) text: Mika's eyes widen as the agent on the flight above them is ripped into the air replaced by a squall of red. Maslow whirls as a blade suddenly pierces his side-- But before it can continue its deadly cut, Maslow catches it in a bloody fist and fires into the shadows. One of the Hanta-Kirra falls tumbling past them down the stairs. Maslow grunts as he rips the chain blade from his side.
76) 9) dialog: Are you ok?
76) 12) dialog: Come on.
78) 0) text: The building carpark.    Mika suddenly stops.
78) 1) dialog: Fuck!
78) 5) dialog: The manuscript--
78) 11) dialog: Maslow--
78) 13) dialog: Tip-toe.
78) 14) text: He opens the door retracing their steps into the dark. Mika suddenly very alone manages a slow nervous pirouette in the crypt-like garage, before skittering for Maslow's sedan. She slides in pulling the door shut behind her as quietly as she can-- And waits.
80) 1) dialog: Come on, Ryan...
80) 3) dialog: Hurry the fuck up!
80) 5) dialog: Motherfuckfuckfuck--
80) 6) text: She twists the ignition and as the motor turns over-- The car's headlights explode, shattered by projectiles that seem to materialize from the void. Mika screams throwing the car into gear-- Peeling out toward the down ramp. The car fishtails down level after level through the oscillating light/dark of the dimly lit exit ramp. Her eyes twitch from mirror to mirror when she sees up ahead-- A shadow hanging in the corner of the tunnel like a spider. She ducks just as the front of the sedan is shredded by a squall of stars. The sedan rebounds into the light. Its hood and windscreen looking as though it was gnawed on by a Great White.
81) 1) dialog: Ryan- I had to leave!
81) 3) dialog: Do you have the map?
81) 5) dialog: Where's Raizo
84) 4) text: Mika's car slashes across the width of the street screeching to a stop next to Raizo. The door snaps open.
84) 5) dialog: Raizo!
84) 6) text: Raizo gets into the car. Collapses into the seat, arms wrapped tight around the ugly wound in his side. She peels away before the others can stop her. Mika carves a path through the traffic, driving as fast as she can. Eager to get more miles between them and the ninjas. Raizo lets out a gasp as the car goes over a bump. shirt is drenched with his own blood.
84) 7) dialog: What were you doing in the street?!
84) 9) dialog: You have to go to a hospital.
85) 0) text: The sort of store where the owner lives above the shop. Mika pounds on the door as a LIGHT comes on in the floor above. A moment later, the door opens.

86) 13) dialog: I'll have him to go. (beat) Can you...help me to the car?
87) 0) text: Mika is the proverbial bat outta hell. Her phone is at her ear.

88) 5) dialog: After a fashion.
88) 7) dialog: Not this time.
88) 11) dialog: Do you have the manuscript?
88) 16) dialog: ...but I promised...
88) 18) dialog: I don't think we have much time...
91) 3) dialog: I know you can't hear me, so I'm sure this doesn't matter, but I'm going to say it anyway.
91) 5) dialog: I'm a forensic researcher, okay? That's like a fancy way of saying I'm a librarian. By myself I can't do anything to help you.
91) 7) dialog: I wanted to think you for saving my life.
91) 9) dialog: And I hope you can forgive me for this.
93) 0) text: Mika watches from the trees as a shadow comes to life on the balcony outside their room. It pauses as if sensing something.

102) 1) dialog: Die you fuck!
102) 4) text: A scatter shot of shurikens send her diving to the floor. But the distraction gives Raizo his chance. The blade whistles, the chain snaps and blood arcs out of Ozunu. Rage thunders the hall. Mika gets back up and aims but-- Ozunu seems to pull the shadows and smoke around him as he disappears.
