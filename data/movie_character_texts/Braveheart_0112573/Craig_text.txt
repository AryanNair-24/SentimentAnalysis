William aims... and fires. The bolt slashes through the a and punches through the armor and the melon, leaving no d what it would do to a man's heart. The nobles pale.

94) 12) dialog: Homage is nothing. It is the crown  that matters!

95) 5) dialog: We cannot. Some scarcely believe you  are alive. Other think you'll pay  them Mornay's wages. We bid you to  Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates,  two days from now, at sunset. Pledge  us your pardon and we will unite  behind you. Scotland will be one.

Robert knows none of them -- yet he knows them all. Old Craig, among the other Scottish nobles mounted beside the Bruce, grows impatient.
