Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
18) 39) dialog: I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.

You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
18) 45) dialog: Didn't like it, did ya?
18) 47) dialog: Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
18) 49) dialog: I can handle Richie, don't worry. The two men look at each other for some measure of trust. Seth sticks out his hand.

24) 63) dialog: I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order. Seth walks away, and the group follows him. We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor Charlie's head. The five of them move across the floor to a table. As the walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude commen from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter. The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested, wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him. Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.

24) 85) text: Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you just created a monster. Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.

24) 107) dialog: Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
24) 111) text: The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The openi notes of the Coaster's "Down in Mexico" fills the room. The crowd hushes up. And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM. This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty tha Stendhal described in "As the Promise of Happiness," but the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom. She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the stage, but like she owned the world. And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, th world is proud to be her possession. All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and accompanies from the table with the guitar. When the music builds to its explosive section. Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of room. She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-u looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charli and points at Seth's table, describing what happened. As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes u from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table. Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured. Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard. She STANDS OVER him. While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whis bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.
24) 113) text: Drink up. Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she surveys. Jacob and Scott are embarrassed. Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power this woman has over a man she's deathly feared. Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keepin the beat with his guitar. Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what Seth and company did to Chet. Richard continues to suck her toes. The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Loo down at the seated Richard. She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whi from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applau none louder than Seth.
24) 114) dialog: Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what I call a fuckin' show! One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe which she puts on. Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.

24) 123) dialog: Richie, you lucky bastard! (to Santanico)
24) 125) dialog: Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red Riding Hood is walking through the forest and she comes across Little Bo Peep, and Little Bo Peep says: "Little Red Riding Hood, are you crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf is walking these woods and if he finds you he's gonna pull down your dress and squeeze your titties?" Then Little Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt and taps a .357 Magnum she has holstered on her thigh and says: "No he won't." As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.
24) 127) text: Oh, shit. (to Seth)
24) 128) text: Seth -- Seth waves him away.
24) 129) dialog: Not now. So finally she comes across the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red Riding Hood, you know better than to be walking around these woods alone. You know I'm just gonna have to pull down your dress and squeeze your titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat me, just like the story says." Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richar Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can s anything -- The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.
24) 139) dialog: Scarred for life, that's how I am! Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.
24) 140) dialog: You thought it was pretty funny, didn't you? Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right... left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards the crowd.
24) 141) dialog: Everybody be cool, or you'll be just as dead as these fucks! SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face. SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor. The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but t waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips. SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It fall to the floor, splattering. WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her f could easily be read as intense sexual desire.
24) 144) text: Richie, look out! Before Richie can turn around. SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and SINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER. Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM. Seth turns to his brother's cry. He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached t a cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs burie deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming about, trying to knock her off. Richard screams to Seth:
24) 148) dialog: Richie. Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on their faces. The patrons scream. A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the and yells:

The bullet from the gun ma the liquor-soaked robe ignite. Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES. Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cr
24) 154) dialog: We may be in trouble. Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighti vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushe aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort. Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off Seth and Jacob. Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponen Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold thei wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make hi look like a huge walking shark. Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind h

Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate, of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth a the bar.
24) 174) dialog: Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
24) 176) dialog: Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
24) 182) dialog: It's bats.
26) 13) text: We got a problem! Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out PO a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its body through the newly formed hole. Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45, point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat. The bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS his head back through the hole. Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment when...
26) 15) dialog: Get this bastard off of me! Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth. Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels b dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. Th body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blo squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the st down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into g Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece o his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy. Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a while, then... BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes som fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his he against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo. Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plaste window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle w the bat-thing. Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together, exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats contin to try and claw their way in.
26) 18) dialog: Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires. Everybody agrees.
26) 19) dialog: You too, preacher?
26) 21) dialog: Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
26) 23) dialog: In other words, no.
26) 26) dialog: I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
26) 28) dialog: Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?
26) 45) dialog: Aside from they're thirsty.
26) 50) dialog: Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man. (he points at Jacob)
26) 52) dialog: As far as God's concerned, we might just as well be a piece of fuckin' shit. But he's one of the boys. Only one problem, his faith ain't what it used to be. Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor Jacob stands over him.
26) 54) dialog: I'm not taunting you. We need you. A faithless preacher doesn't mean shit to us. But a man who's a servant of God can grab a cross, shove it in these monsters' asses. A servant of God can bless the tap water and turn it into a weapon. Seth rises.
26) 55) dialog: I know why you lost your faith. How could true holiness exist if your wife can be taken away from you and your children? Now, I always said God can kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed my lifetime tune about thirty minutes ago' cause I know, without a doubt, what's out there trying to get in here is pure evil straight from hell. And if there is a hell, and those monsters are from it, there's got to be a heaven. Now which are you, a faithless preacher or a mean, mother fuckin' servant of God? Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.
26) 74) dialog: Oh shit! Jacob sees.
26) 76) dialog: You wanna suck something, suck on this! He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all ove the wall. Kate yells:
26) 78) dialog: Daddy's dead.
26) 81) dialog: He needs our help!
27) 0) text: Jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and recitin appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of h restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is mak his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures. The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad, whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above an in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bib in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god to As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even t repugnant sight trip him up. Jacob has backed himself up by the door.
27) 2) dialog: Did he...?
27) 4) dialog: Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin' vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires! Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires! Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the creatures on the other side.
27) 5) dialog: You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
27) 11) text: Children, listen to me. I love you two more than anybody. And I just want you  to know you've made me proud all your lives. But never more so than tonight. And I wish we could sit here and cry till I pass on, but we can't. Because I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to turn into a monster. And when I do, I'm going to be dangerous. But before that happens, just know I love you. (to Seth and the kids)
27) 14) dialog: My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
27) 16) dialog: I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
27) 18) text: The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee, teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what th doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy store are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers. Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes. Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the backroom sink. Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bulle in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo. Vampires all start converging on the back room door, getting their courage back. Kate makes water balloons. Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer. Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons, turning it into holy water. Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to com The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes, begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side. The room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching, pounding, squeaking and screaming. Finally they're ready. Jacob turns to his kids.
27) 20) dialog: I promise.
27) 36) dialog: Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some fuckin' vampires.
28) 0) text: The vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKIN down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst throu the door. Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt gu and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt lik grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holdin the jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room into the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside. What we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild Bunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps ju watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then, like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by starting up the jackhammer.
28) 1) dialog: Kill 'em all! Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react. The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire flesh. The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk forward. They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towa the door. Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speed in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in green vamp blood. Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the other. Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets h Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts a toss them into the crowd. They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, scream in pain. From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops HURLS toward the group. Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES. The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire. Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slammi the hammer stake into vampire chests. The front door is barricaded again by a big table and oth junk.
28) 5) text: To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door! Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, no half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops fr above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Set off the ground. Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the roo he CRASHES into a table. The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer sticking out of his chest, dead. Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She screams:
28) 7) dialog: Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite and feel all right! Kate clusters with her father and Scott.
28) 13) text: Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die! Kate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor, burning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a couple of water balloons and a stake.
28) 16) dialog: Anytime. Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across t bar. Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in fiery death. Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons. As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He sta to hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices t vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow His eyes are yellow. Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster. Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams blood murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood. Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and SMASHES it against Jacob's head. The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets g of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor. Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings up to fire. A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches star with the boy he once called his son. Scott's eyes turn to steel.
28) 18) dialog: Fight now, cry later. Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face with a holy water balloon, which melts his head. A bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams it bites into him. He drops the .45. Kate sees Scott get bit.
28) 22) dialog: How many bullets left, kid?
28) 24) dialog: Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper. The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor. The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stand holding the .45, arm outstretched.
28) 27) dialog: You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you. The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sight on the face of an approaching vampire. Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the firs vampire's head that gets in swinging distance. Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched vamps scream like they've never screamed before.
28) 28) dialog: Shoot more holes! Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wa behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and Seth with a safe, lighted area. The .45's empty. The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being able to get at them. The two survivors hold hands, when... All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded from the outside. The vamps look towards it in horror. From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a Spanish accent.

The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in th door. The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward. The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamp are instantly fried, bursting into flames. The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY a MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themsel in fright. Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlig hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the va combust in fiery explosions. The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control. Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through t door into the parking lot.
29) 2) text: What the fuck was going on in there? Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his breath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in th kisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.
