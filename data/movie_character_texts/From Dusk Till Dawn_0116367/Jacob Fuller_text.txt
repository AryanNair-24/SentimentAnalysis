The members of the unit consist of the father, JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edge and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who possesses what can only be described as an apple pie sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl, complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's Vietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired k who always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy met garage band he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three of them are wolfing down a late lunch.

My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
5) 30) dialog: I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
5) 32) dialog: Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.

17) 31) dialog: (to Kate)
17) 34) text: You two, Simon says sit the fuck down! They slowly sit. Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate. Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Bot for their own reasons.
17) 37) dialog: On the dresser.
17) 54) dialog: Look, if you want the motor home, just take it and get out. Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male hostages.

18) 38) dialog: Yes.
18) 40) dialog: How do I know you'll keep your word?
18) 42) dialog: You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.

24) 52) dialog: If you look outside your door, parked in your parking lot, you'll see a big ass recreational vehicle. That's mine. In order to drive that legally, you need a class two driver's license. That is the same license that the DMV requires truck drivers to carry in order to drive a truck. (he takes the license out of his wallet and lays it on the bar)
24) 53) text: That is me, and this is my class two license. This is a truck driver's bar, I am a truck driver, and these are my friends. Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech. Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks everyone in the party and smiles.

Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what Seth and company did to Chet. Richard continues to suck her toes. The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Loo down at the seated Richard. She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whi from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd applauds.

26) 20) dialog: I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
26) 22) dialog: In the Winnebago.
26) 27) dialog: What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
26) 37) dialog: About two hours from now.
26) 40) dialog: Has anybody here read a real book about vampires, or are we just remembering what a movie said? I mean a real book.

Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in t door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as har as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screa howls and snaps in fury. Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his .45 in its big mouth.

But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of h restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is mak his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures. The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad, whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above an in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bib in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god to As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a candy bar.

27) 10) dialog: (to his children)
27) 12) text: Now, I'd say in the next twenty or thirty minutes our friends outside will bust in this door. And I'll probably turn into a vampire within the hour. Now, you have two choices. You can wait for me to turn, then deal with me, then wait for them to burst inside here and the three of you will deal with them. Or, we can kick open that door and the four of us can hit 'em with everything we have, and carve a path right through 'em to front entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em, we gotta go at 'em now. I confused them, I scared them, I took them off guard. But they're going to get unconfused, they're going to get unscared, they're going to get together and they're going to hit that door like a ton of bricks. And when that moment arrives, we gotta be ready. Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and fill with boxes and crates.

27) 18) text: The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee, teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what th doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy store are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers. Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes. Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the backroom sink. Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bulle in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo. Vampires all start converging on the back room door, getting their courage back. Kate makes water balloons. Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer. Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons, turning it into holy water. Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to com The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes, begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side. The room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching, pounding, squeaking and screaming. Finally they're ready. Jacob turns to his kids.
27) 19) dialog: Before we go any further, I need you three to promise me something. I'll fight with you to the bitter end, but when I turn into one of them, I won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a lap dog of Satan. I want you three to promise you'll take me down, no different from the rest. The kids can't say the words.
