20) 0) text: Bryan sits on the ground in the living room, illuminated by a single lamp. The couch made up for a bed. Spread out in front of him are 4 VOLUMES of transcripts and a folder full of records from Walter McMillian’s case. INSERT CLOSEUP DOCUMENT 1 -- “Walter ‘Johnny D’ McMillian case no. #####.” INSERT CLOSEUP DOCUMENT 2 -- “Ralph Myers -- quote from testimony...” (CONTINUED)
57) 0) text: FOLLOW SHOT -- BEHIND Ralph Myers as he’s escorted to the visiting room. We don’t see his face.
58) 0) text: FOLLOW RALPH MYERS (50) INTO a room full of PRISONERS and VISITORS. Bryan stands to look at him. Ralph is frail and vulnerable, but with eyes sharp and roaming. Dangerous. Bryan nods as Ralph approaches. Up close, the map of burn scars across his face adds an extra air of menace.
58) 2) dialog: You Bobby?
58) 6) dialog: Maybe later. A PRISONER LAUGHS LOUDLY across the room. Ralph JUMPS, scans the room, deeply paranoid. After a beat --
58) 8) dialog: You buyin’ me a Coke first? Or you gonna make me stare at them vending machines all day? Ralph motions to the VENDING MACHINES along the wall. A beat before -- Bryan nods, turns, and walks to the machines as --
58) 9) dialog: Sunkist Orange and some Jujyfruits if they got ‘em! INT. ST. CLAIR CORRECTIONAL —- VISITING ROOM - MOMENTS 77
58) 13) dialog: (burps ) No. (off Bryan's confusion) I ain’t talkin’ about him.
58) 15) dialog: Well, if you don’t like it, leave. Ralph takes a SIP, clocking Bryan’s disappointment. (CONTINUED)
58) 18) dialog: Aw, come on, don’t look so sad, we can still talk about other stuff. I like talkin’. My wife says if I got paid for every word I said, we'd be a couple a billionaires. Bryan considers his options, closes his notebook, carefully begins to guide the conversation, drawing him out.
58) 20) dialog: Long enough to pop out a couple a’ kids and watch her turn ‘em all against me. You got kids?
58) 22) dialog: The thing about kids is, they ain’t nothin’ like havin’ a dog. It is a whole different thing. I wish somebody told me that earlier... My kids think they got it so bad but they ain’t seen nothin’ like I seen. Try makin’ it as a foster kid your whole damn life, soon as you figure out one shitty parent, they movin’ you to a new one.
58) 24) dialog: How many kids he got?
58) 30) dialog: Maybe I was just bored.
58) 32) dialog: From the first day they lock my ass up in Escambia, for something I’m tellin’ you I ain’t had nothing to do with, all them police wanna talk about is Ronda Morrison. Morrison this, and Morrison that. Sometime four or five of ‘em in the room at the same time.
58) 34) dialog: Alls I’m sayin’ is, ain’t nobody cared about a damn thing besides who killed that girl. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
58) 38) dialog: And when people care about a thing that much, they do anything to get what they want. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
58) 41) dialog: (beat; shakes head) You know they’11 kill you if you get to the bottom of this, right? Off Bryan’s surprise, Ralph LAUGHS AGAIN, suddenly stands.
58) 43) dialog: We done here, Bobby. Thanks for the Jujies.
58) 45) dialog: I am. He walks to the door, YELLS to the guard --
58) 46) dialog: Ready, boss! Bryan watches Ralph go, his words ringing in his head.
62) 2) dialog: (on tape) I understand that, Sheriff...
62) 4) dialog: (on tape) That’s what I’m trying to tell you, because I’m gonna be honest, I don’t know a damn thing.
62) 7) dialog: (on tape) Yes, sir, it’s righter than anything I’ve ever said.
62) 9) dialog: (on tape) That’s right, sir, I will. (CONTINUED)
62) 13) dialog: (on tape; firm and strong) I will face any damn body in this world on that, ‘cause it’s a stone lie. And if you askin’ me to frame a innocent man for murder, that just ain’t somethin’ I’m willin’ to do. Bryan STOPS the tape, looks to Brenda and Eva, stunned until --
89) 0) text: BOOM! The door SLAMS behind Ralph Myers. Bryan sits at the table in the EMPTY ROOM, he doesn’t stand or have the space for any bullshit. As Ralph approaches --
89) 1) dialog: Hope this important news of yours comes with somethin’ to eat, ‘cause I’m starvin’.
89) 3) dialog: You was a lot nicer last time.
89) 5) dialog: You knew that guy? Bryan nods, lets this sit for a moment before continuing.
89) 10) dialog: What’s that?
89) 23) dialog: They put me in the cell closest to the kill room... (long beat; fidgets) Middle of the night, everybody started screamin’ and bangin’ on the bars. And then... then come the smell of his skin burnin’. Ralph points to the burn scar on his face.
89) 24) dialog: I know that smell.
89) 26) dialog: I was sleepin’ in my foster mom's basement and her heater blowed up, catched my PJs on fire. I screamed for two minutes straight before they found me. (beat; grows frustrated) Everybody knowed that I got a fear of bein’ burned. They knowed what it do to my head to be in a place like that. (looks to Bryan) I couldn’t stop shaking all night, curled up on the floor cryin’ like a baby, tryin’ to breathe, but every breath just give you another taste of the man they killed. (beat) You can’t go through somethin’ like that and come out the same. Bryan understands exactly what he means. (CONTINUED)
89) 30) dialog: The next morning, I called the Sheriff and told him I'd say whatever he wanted if he got me out. He took my statement and moved me back to county the same day. Bryan sees his window, gently pushes forward.
89) 32) dialog: I didn’t say nothin’ about lyin’... now you puttin’ words in my mouth. He tries to look strong, but clearly overwhelmed by guilt and fear. Bryan continues with caution.
95) 9) dialog: (snaps out of it) Yes, sir. Sorry, guards got me up at two in the morning to get out here. (CONTINUED)
95) 14) dialog: (odd beat) Is that when that was?
95) 16) dialog: Okay, then. Sure, if you say so. Ralph looks more nervous by the second, color draining from his face. Bryan fights his nerves, remains steady --
95) 18) dialog: Don’t think I can fully remember to be honest with you. Sorry, sir. Bryan's heart sinks. They haven’t even begun and they’re already losing him. A BREATH before --
95) 23) dialog: (nervous; scratches scar) Yes, sir. I guess so.
95) 25) dialog: (beat; nods) Yes, sir. Bryan locks his eyes on him --
95) 27) dialog: I don’t know.
95) 29) dialog: Don’t... think I remember. Walter sinks in his seat as A MURMUR fills the courtroom. Behind him, Minnie stares in shock as John shakes his head. Tommy WHISPERS to his assistant as he scribbles notes. Bryan notices Ralph glance past him again. He turns, follows Ralph's gaze to Tate, staring harshly back at him from his seat. Ralph is frozen in fear until -- Bryan deliberately steps between Ralph and Tate, blocking their view of each other. Gently locks his eyes on Ralph. (CONTINUED)
95) 33) dialog: Yes, sir.
95) 35) dialog: Yes, sir.
95) 38) dialog: No, sir, not at all. A wave of GASPS and WHISPERS rolls through the audience. Tommy sits in his seat, completely stunned -- Walter sits back, eyes still locked on Ralph as --
95) 41) dialog: No, sir. (CONTINUED)
95) 45) dialog: No. Never did.
95) 47) dialog: Absolutely not. 102. 115 Bryan lets this sink in, looks at him with care. Then --
96) 3) dialog: If I testified... but the truth ain’t got nothin’ to do with it. When it come to them, Ralph Myers is tellin’ the truth when it agrees with what they wantin’ for you to say. But if it ain’t what they wanna hear, Ralph is a liar.
96) 7) dialog: Because that don’t make no sense, sir. Who do you think is decidin’ what happens to me? If I live or die? Not me. Not Johnny D. It’s all y’all that decidin’ that. So how is me sayin’ what I’m sayin’ gonna help me get out? If anything, it gonna help me get to death row. Tommy doesn’t respond to this. Ralph looks to Sheriff Tate.
96) 8) dialog: But I don’t care, y’all can do what you want to me. But I got to tell the truth now, even though it might not be what y’all wanna hear --
96) 10) dialog: But I ain’t done.
96) 14) dialog: Thank you, Your Honor. (beat; looks around) I think it’s pretty clear to y’all I ain’t no saint. I can’t read, and I ain’t made it past the third grade, but I still know what’s right and what’s wrong. Anda innocent man dyin’ on account a me, or you, or anyone in this room, ain't right. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
96) 17) dialog: (to the Judge) ‘Cause me, I can look in your face or anybody else’s face dead eye-to- eyeball and tell you anything I told about Mr. McMillian was a lie. (looks right at Walter) He's here because of me, and I would really appreciate you sendin’ him home to his kids where he belongs. Walter locks eyes with Ralph again, everything having changed between them. A moment of true, shared sincerity. Bryan and Eva exchange a charged look as MUSIC takes us to --
120) 0) text: Sheriff Tate drinks with some off-duty COPS, all watching -- ON TV: Ed Bradley sits with Ralph Myers, in his prison uniform.
120) 1) dialog: (on TV) I told them I had seen a young girl laying on the floor with her mouth open. Johnny D standing over her.
120) 3) dialog: (on TV) Yeah, I had told the court that, yeah.
120) 5) dialog: (on TV) No, sir, not at all. Nowhere near true.
120) 7) dialog: (on TV) Well, it’s like this. I don’t know the words for that, but I can tell you this much... Right is right, and wrong is wrong. And for a man to straighten his own life out, he must tell the truth. He must try to do what is right, and that’s what I’m tryin’ to do. 149 JUST MERCY - FULL YELLOW 124. INT.
