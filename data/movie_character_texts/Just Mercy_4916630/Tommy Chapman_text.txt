25) 15) dialog: But I’m sure you didn’t come all the way down here to talk about that. What can I do for you today, Bryan? Bryan reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a file of transcripts, with portions highlighted.
25) 17) dialog: You know I wasn’t part of his prosecution, right? That was before my time.
25) 19) dialog: This was one of the most outrageous crimes in Monroe County history, and your client made a lot of people here very angry.
25) 23) dialog: But I already know what happened. Johnny D McMillian was convicted by a jury of brutally murdering a teenage girl in my community. And it’s my job to defend the integrity of that conviction. Bryan sits back, was hoping for a different response.
25) 25) dialog: You’re the only one I know who thinks that.

52) 7) dialog: Hooks isn’t the state’s main witness, Ralph Myers is.
52) 22) dialog: Sure. (off Bryan's surprise) Doesn’t really matter, now that the court denied your motion to reopen the case. Bryan stares at them both, caught completely off guard.

96) 2) dialog: Mr. Myers, didn’t you work out a deal with the State to get a lighter sentence if you testified to the truth? Ralph thinks a beat, then --
96) 4) dialog: Well, how do we know you’re not lying now? How do we know, you ain't just upset about the deal you got, and you feel like somehow by you changing your story, it might help you get out? 116 Ralph's fear is gone completely now, ready for a fight. (CONTINUED)

120) 14) dialog: (on TV) What’s wrong with our criminal justice system is the fact that, um, people want to come back sometime and second-guess juries. Uh, I don’t think there been any law enforcement misconduct in this case, I don’t think anyone’s proved it. (CONTINUED)
120) 19) dialog: (on TV) Yes... I’d be comfortable with it.

130) 11) dialog: This ain’t got nothin’ to do with my reputation. It’s about the people in this county who hired me to keep them safe.
130) 13) dialog: You drive all the way down here at dinnertime just to tell me how to do my job?
130) 18) dialog: Next time you wanna stop by my house, I’d appreciate you callin’ first. (beat) Get the hell off my property. Tommy heads inside as Bryan turns back to his car, unfazed.
