11) 0) text: Bryan walks down a hall, hears the fiery voice of EVA ANSLEY arguing with BILL FREEMAN (50s, white).
11) 1) dialog: Are you kiddin’ me? This is complete hogshit and you know it. We had an agreement to rent this space for the next two years. You said it was a done deal. Bryan turns the corner, sees Eva with the owner, her son CHRIS (6) beside her, plays with a Transformers toy.
11) 3) dialog: We're giving poor people their constitutional right to counsel, Bill! You wanna explain to my son what the hell you think is wrong with that? Bryan interrupts gently, trying to ease the tension.
11) 9) dialog: (turns to Bryan) Bryan, thank God. (to Bill) This is the Executive Director of our organization, who just moved here to work in the office you promised us.
11) 11) dialog: Director of operations, and you're making me look really bad in front of my boss right now.
11) 17) dialog: They put Jesus on death row, Bill. He wasn’t such a bad guy. (ALT LINE)
11) 25) dialog: (under her breath) What a piece of shit. (to Bryan; serious) This wasn’t how I wanted to welcome you. I’11 find an office, I just have to change my tactics.
11) 27) dialog: Maybe Chris can clear some of his toys out of the living room for you?
11) 30) dialog: Sorry for cussing, baby.
11) 32) dialog: He was a piece of shit, though. EXT. BRYAN’S CIVIC/LANDLORD’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 13 Bryan gets out of his car, in front of an old, mid-sized house. He looks around, notices a WHITE WOMAN staring from her porch. He waves. She goes inside, suspicious. HONK, HONK! He turns to see a Bronco zipping toward him, the driver waves as she pulls to a stop beside him. This is EVA ANSLEY (30s), a true Southern firebrand.
11) 33) dialog: Welcome to Alabama! (CONTINUED)
11) 40) dialog: Am I late?
11) 42) dialog: This is my son, Chris.

11) 48) dialog: What can we carry? EXT. BRYAN’S CIVIC/LANDLORD’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON (MOMENTS
11) 51) dialog: I'm so pissed I still haven't found an office. I was hoping to have one by the time you got here, but I just got our third rejection this week. I swear someone at the state department is trying to shut us down before we even get started.
11) 53) dialog: As soon as that clears, I'll find us an office if I have to break someone’s kneecaps. (to Chris) Just kidding, baby. They reach the front door. Before Bryan even has a chance to knock, the door OPENS to reveal MRS. FRANKLIN (50s, white), a deceivingly kind face, looks at Bryan, seems confused.
11) 62) dialog: Good to meet you, ma’am.
11) 64) dialog: (sarcastic) She seems like a lovely woman. The door OPENS. It’s MR. FRANKLIN, sent to deal with the problem. He looks from Bryan to Eva, addressing her as --
11) 68) dialog: What a piece a shit. (CONTINUED)
11) 72) dialog: We should sue ‘em for housing discrimination.
11) 74) dialog: You'll stay with us as long as you need. Daddy's cookin’ chicken tonight, and Chris is gonna help peel some potatoes. (hugs Chris) Sorry for cussing, baby. Bryan can’t help but smile, a closeness here already as they head to their cars.

12) 1) dialog: He and his friend robbed a pawnshop in Mobile. His friend shot the owner and they both got death. (beat) When he sat down across from me, I was pissin’ myself, I was so scared. First thing he did was fold his arms across his chest and ask me why his belt got arrested. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
12) 4) dialog: (off Bryan's confusion) Then he just stared at me for like twenty seconds...
12) 6) dialog: (slaps Doug playfully) Then, he leaned forward and said, my belt got arrested because it held up a pair of pants. Bryan and Doug LAUGH as Eva nods, this really happened.
12) 7) dialog: We were instant friends. (somber beat) The night he was executed, he asked me to throw him a party and play ‘Born to be Wild’ on repeat. Eva smiles at the irony, gets a little emotional. Doug rubs her back with care.
12) 10) dialog: (nods ) His attorney was openly in favor of the death penalty because he thought mad dogs ought to die. Everyone on the row either had shitty representation or none at all. So I just started calling every law firm in the Yellow Pages to find people to help. I was averaging about twenty rejections a day.
12) 16) dialog: (nods; to Bryan) I was just about to give up, when I got a call from this Harvard lawyer saying he just passed the Alabama Bar and was planning to start a legal center for death row inmates. I was in before you even offered me the job.
12) 18) dialog: I haven’t told Doug that part yet.

23) 7) dialog: (sarcastic) That seems logical.
23) 9) dialog: Seriously?
23) 11) dialog: And where’s that guy? Anyone looking for him? Bryan shakes his head -- exactly. Nothing makes sense. He grabs another paper.
23) 15) dialog: So, an eighteen-year-old white girl is murdered in broad daylight and the Sheriff can’t solve the crime for how long?
23) 17) dialog: (looks at Ralph's photo) Then some guy charged with a different murder says he can tell them who did it if they give hima lower sentence. And the guy who did it happens to be a black man from a poor community that no one would think twice about. Both can feel the energy here. Something is horribly wrong with this conviction. Bryan looks in the now empty box.
23) 19) dialog: Tommy Chapman just took over for Pearson a few months ago. He used to be a public defender.
23) 21) dialog: (beat; considers) Let’s hope not.
26) 4) dialog: Helping a black man convicted of killing a white girl is political suicide in that county. I’m sure he’s been reminded of that by whoever gave him his job.
27) 2) dialog: Doesn't surprise me. (yells to the kids) Chris! Bobby! Come eat your snack! The boys run over as Eva continues with Bryan.
27) 4) dialog: Okay. If I don’t hear from you by morning, I’ll send a rescue party.
27) 6) dialog: Me, too. (sincere) Just be careful, okay? Bryan nods, more aware by the moment of what he’s up against.
29) 23) dialog: I can’t imagine what it would feel like to know I was at home with my husband, and have a judge say, no, you weren’t... your truth is wrong. Bryan takes this in, processing everything before --

33) 1) dialog: Herbert was eighteen when he went to Vietnam. He was the only survivor in an ambush that killed his whole platoon. He had a mental breakdown, attempted suicide, and got sent home on an honorable discharge. (flips through pages) Back home he continued having nightmares, crying fits, running out of his house screaming ‘incoming’ to his neighbors.
33) 5) dialog: Course, he was. (beat) What can we do?
33) 9) dialog: Hello?
33) 11) dialog: (beat; shocked) Who the hell is this? Bryan turns in his chair, eyes locked on Eva as --

34) 2) dialog: Are they sure? Bryan notices an OLD SEDAN drive past, a YOUNG WHITE MAN in the passenger seat locks eyes with Bryan as they go by. It sends a chill down his spine. Eva catches the exchange, gives Chris a squeeze.
34) 3) dialog: Okay, baby, let’s get you to bed. Eva exchanges a look with Bryan as they head inside. EXT. EVA’S HOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT 50 Eva sits on the porch, smoking. Bryan exits the house and sits beside her. They stare into the darkness for a moment.
34) 4) dialog: When you asked me to do this with you, I knew I’d lose some friends, have people talkin’ shit behind my back, or to my face. And I was fine with that. Don’t need anyone to like me long as I’m doin’ what I’m supposed to. But threatenin’ my family... (long beat) I don’t know what the hell to do with that. Bryan can see how hard this is for her. It worries him, too, putting other people on the line. A long beat before -- (CONTINUED)
34) 8) dialog: I don’t want my son growing up knowing his mom stopped doing what was right because she was scared of some crazy bigot. (looks to Bryan; sincere) But we can’t keep working here. I’m waitin’ to hear back about a place in Old Alabama Town. It ain't pretty, but it fits the budget.
34) 10) dialog: So, what’s next?
34) 12) dialog: (sarcastic) Maybe once they see how charming we are they’1ll stop tryin’ to kill us. + eH Bryan’s smile takes us to --

39) 6) dialog: (shrugs) We're just helping people. Charles thinks for a beat, then, seems satisfied with that answer, he nods -- likes the sound of that.

She sets the mug on the table, doesn’t take a sip, haunted by the empty chairs that were once filled with those she loves. For a moment, she lets down her guard, lets the pain and frustration bubble to the surface of her skin.

Then, after she lets it out, she composes herself, wipes her tears, and takes a sip of her coffee.
