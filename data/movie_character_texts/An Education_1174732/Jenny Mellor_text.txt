0) 20) dialog: Can I stop going to the youth orchestra, then?
0) 22) dialog: Ah. Yes. But. I've already joined in. So now I can stop.
0) 24) dialog: No. They don't want people who think for themselves.

0) 33) dialog: It'll be all right. I won't wait.                         It's going to bucket down in a                            minute.

0) 57) dialog: I'm not a Jew!
0) 60) dialog: Oh. (She smiles awkwardly.) Can I sit in the car with my cello? David stops the car.
0) 63) dialog: It's even nicer on the inside.

0) 132) dialog: The whole point about him is that                        he doesn't feel.
0) 134) dialog: Camus doesn't want you to like him. What he's trying to say is that feeling is bourgeois. Being engagee is bourgeois. His mother dies and he doesn't feel anything. He kills this Arab and he doesn't feel anything.
0) 136) dialog: No. That just makes you a cow.
0) 140) dialog: Well I'm going to be French. I'm going to Paris and I'm going to smoke and listen to Jacques Brel and wear black. And I won't speak. Ever. C'est plus chic, comme... She breaks off.

My friends Danny and                          Helen will be going too, so it wouldn't be...I'll tell you what. I'll come and pick you up, and if your mother and father disapprove, then you can have the tickets and go with one of them. How does that sound? Jenny doesn't know what to say. She looks at David, and h eagerness to please seems to convince her. JENNY
0) 153) text: I usually watch Danny. He knows that sort of thing. Jenny smiles. DAVID
0) 154) text: Seven? And we'll probably go for a spot of supper afterwards, if you...But if you, if that's not...Well, we can always put you in a taxi. JENNY

0) 158) text: Well. I mean, if you'd like supper, then, perhaps on Friday you could...not eat? JENNY
0) 159) text: (embarrassed again) Oh. Yes. Of course. Jenny smiles, and rejoins her friends on the other side o the road. Tina and Hattie are standing there almost with their mouths open, amazed. She doesn't say anything and starts to walk on.
0) 161) text: I'm sorry. I just had the strangest dream. I dreamed you crossed the road and spoke to a handsome man with the most beautiful car I've ever seen. And then you came back and you didn't mention it. Jenny smiles enigmatically. Tina grabs Jenny mock-urgentl TINA

0) 206) text: (panic-stricken and shouting) What's she talking about? I've never said anything like that in my life! Anyway, it's just an expression! I'm not against the Jews! Jenny comes back in with David, who is dressed stylishly his early-60s young executive leisurewear - sports jacket slacks, cashmere sweater. He looks out of place - he is brighter and brasher than his surroundings, the most colourful thing in the room, and he seems intimidatingly exotic. David has obviously heard Jack's last line. DAVID
0) 208) text: I didn't mean I'm not against you... Actually, I did mean that, because I'm not, but... JENNY
0) 212) text: (deadpan) You didn't tell me you had a sister, Jenny. General confusion, until David chuckles naughtily. Marjor giggles, and then offers her hand. DAVID
0) 218) text: I'd love one, Jack, but we're running a little late. If Jenny's ready, perhaps we'll shoot off. Jenny looks at her father, and takes a calculated gamble. JENNY
0) 227) text: Back by ten, please, David. She's usually in bed by then. Jenny winces. DAVID

0) 261) text: That would be nice. But South Ken... C'est beaucoup trop cher pour moi. They stare at each other. Helen is bewildered, Jenny embarrassed. HELEN
0) 262) text: Sorry? JENNY
0) 264) text: No you didn't. You said something completely different. JENNY
0) 266) text: In French? Why? Jenny feels humiliated; she is yet to realise what we can see - that Helen is simply very dim. JENNY
0) 267) text: I don't know. Jenny looks away. Helen stares at her. The performance be rings, and they make their way back to the men. To Jenny' surprise and pleasure, Helen links arms with her as they walk. HELEN
0) 268) text: Anyway. It's too expensive for me, too. We don't have to worry about that. If you want something in South Ken, get David to take you shopping. JENNY
0) 280) text: Have you never heard "Chante Francoise Sagan"? Jenny shakes her head. Her eyes are wide - she's clearly awe-struck. David offers her a cigarette - a Gitane - whi she takes. He lights it for her while she's listening. DANNY

0) 283) text: You've got a French conversation teacher? JENNY
0) 286) text: (ignoring her) You must have seen her sing?                          Jenny shakes her head again and smiles. Where would she have seen Juliette Greco? Danny, meanwhile, is baffled. W hasn't seen Juliette Greco? DAVID
0) 294) text: Oh. No. Can't do it. There's a Burne-Jones coming up at Christie's on Friday. And I want                      it.                                                   JENNY

0) 335) text: Is there no end to your thirst for literary understanding, Jenny? As you may have noticed, I'm attempting to turn the subject away from Jenny's lurid love-life and towards the matter in hand. She starts to hand out essays. MISS STUBBS
0) 336) text: And it's quite clear on this evidence that most of you know much too much about the former, and almost nothing about the latter. Reluctantly I must concede that Jenny is evidently an expert on both matters. Excellent as always, Jenny. Miss Stubbs slaps an essay down on Jenny's desk. We can s that it's marked `A+'.

Tina and Hattie aren't with her, and she sits on h own -the atmosphere of the class is very different from Miss Stubbs' English lessons. The girls are different, mo serious, less fun, and the atmosphere is more sombre. The teacher, MRS WILSON, is older, plainer, stricter. She pul some papers out of her bag.
1) 10) dialog: How are you going to "have it out" with her? What are you going to do? Shout at her until she decides I'm much cleverer than she thinks?
1) 13) dialog: We don't go to Oxford. Any of us. Not even you, Dad.
1) 17) dialog: Oh, yes. That's the whole point of an Oxford education. It's the expensive alternative to a dinner dance.
1) 26) text: That chair was free. The sofa. We don't have to pay for anything. And even if we did, we don't have to work for it. That's the beauty of life, Jenny. Everything's free. Grows on trees. Wonderful, isn't it? (He warms to his theme, and grows progressively more berserk.) We've got a lovely Oxford tree in the garden, lucky for you, so that's Oxford taken care of. And a whole orchard of school trees, so that's all free. I'm sure there are some private tuition trees out there. I'll go and have a look. He stands up. MARJORIE

2) 279) dialog: Sod. Miss Davies. They stand up, grind their Sobranies into the mud, kick them under the bench, and set off at a brisk trot. The Sobranie stubs come to rest near a pile of dog poo.
2) 282) dialog: Not that I know of.
2) 284) dialog: Graham?
2) 288) dialog: What did you happen to be talking to her about?
2) 290) dialog: What if David turns up?
2) 296) dialog: And who's the skinned cat, in                          this enchanting image? Me?

3) 73) dialog: What on earth is that for?
3) 75) dialog: With a banana?
3) 77) dialog: David, I don't want to lose my virginity to a piece of fruit.
3) 79) dialog: Let's wait until we get to Paris. I think the moment might have gone.
3) 82) dialog: And David..... if tomorrow night does happen, it will never happen again, so...
3) 85) dialog: Because the first time can only happen once.

5) 5) dialog: Not after the...first bit. It's funny, though, isn't it? All that poetry, and all those songs and films, about something that lasts no time at all? David looks at her. She isn't being cruel. She just doesn know any different. She returns to her people-watching. H smokes ruminatively.
5) 9) dialog: (artfully)
5) 13) dialog: Why will I need to miss it?
5) 16) dialog: (distracted)
5) 23) dialog: Of course.(To Hattie and Tina) I'll catch you up. Miss Stubbs waits until the room empties.

5) 45) dialog: Maybe our lives are always going to end up with pony essays. Or housework. And yes, maybe we'll go up to Oxford. But if we're all going to die the moment we graduate, maybe it's what we do before that counts.

5) 72) dialog: About what?
5) 77) text: You do know what you're doing, old chap? With Jenny?

5) 145) dialog: (quietly, turning the words over in her mouth)
5) 148) dialog: All that Latin! All those essays! What was the point? Why didn't you just send me out prowling round nightclubs? It would have been less trouble. And I might have had more fun.
5) 150) dialog: How?
5) 158) text: (sotto voce, to Jenny, in the seat next to her) No. Jenny starts to giggle. ANN

5) 186) dialog: Nobody has been able to explain to me the point of University.
5) 188) text: Nobody does anything worth doing without a degree. JENNY
5) 190) text: So what I do isn't worth doing. Or what Miss Stubbs does, or Mrs Wilson, or any of us here. Jenny doesn't say anything. The headmistress takes her silence as an admission of defeat. HEADMISTRESS
5) 191) text: Because none of us would be here without our degrees, you realise that, don't you? And yes, of course studying is hard, and boring, and... Jenny can't contain herself any longer.
5) 192) dialog: Boring!
5) 198) dialog: I don't wish to be impertinent, Mrs Walters. But it is an argument worth rehearsing. You never know. Someone else might want to know what the point of it all is, one day. She leaves the office.
5) 203) dialog: I'm not sitting them.
5) 206) dialog: (witheringly)
5) 211) dialog: I'm sure David will pay you back. Send him a bill. As you said, he wouldn't have wanted me if I was dim, so he should fork out. Just tell me why there's a point in sitting my exams, and there's no point in me going to University. Jack gapes at her. He's floundering.
5) 213) dialog: In which case I should have left school years ago, shouldn't I? Ask them for the money back. If I'm too clever by half, you overpaid by a third.
5) 221) dialog: Am I still allowed to read?
5) 225) dialog: Danny didn't seem very pleased about our engagement.
5) 227) dialog: (trying not to be pleased)
5) 233) dialog: Where is the flat again?

5) 259) dialog: Your mother and father?                                  
5) 264) dialog: Did you do this one? "Show from any TWO scenes in `Pride and Prejudice' how far it is true that Jane Austen's methods are `essentially dramatic'".

5) 278) text: What sort of things can you have for starters? I mean, how will I know what are starters and what aren't? I'm all right if it's soup or fruit juice. But if it's anything more than that... JENNY
