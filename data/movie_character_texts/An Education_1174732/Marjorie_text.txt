0) 117) text: What's going on here? MARJORIE
0) 125) text: Well I don't like it. MARJORIE
0) 191) text: How d'you know that? MARJORIE
0) 198) text: And I've just said. That's where I'm not going. There must be something on locally. Where's the paper? MARJORIE
0) 202) text: Oh, bloody hell. MARJORIE
0) 210) text: I'm sorry. What I'm saying is that you're not the sort of, of person I'd be against, if I were the sort of person who was against...people. You're not an old...Oh, dear. I'm Jack, and this is Marjorie.
0) 215) text: So. Gosh. (He looks around approvingly.) This is lovely. Marjorie smiles.
0) 216) dialog: Thank you. JACK
0) 232) text: Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it. See you again. They exchange warm handshakes. He turns to Marjorie. Marjorie extends her hand. David takes it, but kisses it suavely,leaving her a little flustered. MARJORIE
0) 238) dialog: It's called after-shave, Jack. And it makes a change from carbolic soap.

0) 314) dialog: I can't get this casserole dish clean. We had hot-pot tonight, and it's all burnt round...
0) 317) dialog: I know what the time is. How was your evening?
0) 319) dialog: And he took you home in his car? Right to the door? Jenny looks at her. She doesn't seem to have heard what Jenny has just said.
0) 321) dialog: And I'm glad you enjoyed the concert.
0) 407) text: Jack and Marjorie. JENNY
1) 5) dialog: I'll talk to him. Jack enters, back from work. He's wearing a suit and carrying a battered briefcase. He looks at them, and then notices the essay on the table.
1) 7) dialog: The test didn't...Well, it didn't go as well as we'd hoped. He picks up the paper.
1) 11) dialog: Everyone's doing their best, Jack.
1) 15) dialog: You don't mean that.
1) 18) dialog: What about private tuition?
1) 22) text: Five bob! But... we could spend five bob on this and five bob on that, and before we know it that's our savings down the drain. MARJORIE
1) 24) text: Oh, nothing. (He gestures round the room.) It's all free. That vase was free. MARJORIE
1) 26) text: That chair was free. The sofa. We don't have to pay for anything. And even if we did, we don't have to work for it. That's the beauty of life, Jenny. Everything's free. Grows on trees. Wonderful, isn't it? (He warms to his theme, and grows progressively more berserk.) We've got a lovely Oxford tree in the garden, lucky for you, so that's Oxford taken care of. And a whole orchard of school trees, so that's all free. I'm sure there are some private tuition trees out there. I'll go and have a look. He stands up. MARJORIE
2) 29) text: Yes, that's true. I'm only going on what I've seen over the last sixteen years. MARJORIE
2) 41) dialog: Isn't that funny?
2) 51) text: He wrote a children's book called `The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe' that did very well, I believe. MARJORIE
2) 53) text: Well, to us he was just the old codger who taught Medieval literature. But I came to know him very well. We just...got along, do you know what I mean? Everyone murmurs their comprehension. MARJORIE
2) 56) text: I'd love to meet him. There is a pause. Jack and Marjorie look at the floor. Somehow, David has manoeuvred a situation where, effectively, he is the one being asked. DAVID
2) 67) dialog: Sounds like too good an opportunity to pass up.
2) 219) dialog: Did you have a nice time?
2) 224) dialog: "Clive"...Lucky girl. What was he                       like?
2) 226) dialog: And did he show you round?
2) 228) dialog: What did you think?
2) 232) text: Never a dull moment with David, is there? If it's not concerts, it's famous authors. Bit different from that lad you brought home for tea, isn't he? MARJORIE
2) 238) text: Well, it says something about you, doesn't it? It says you're going places. It says you're well connected. He's an impressive young man, that David. I like him more and more. MARJORIE
2) 240) text: He wasn't. And now he is. MARJORIE
2) 242) text: I feel....I Feel I should do my homework. She leaves the room. Marjorie watches her go thoughtfully
2) 283) dialog: I've asked Graham round for tea and birthday cake.
2) 287) dialog: I happened to be talking to his mother about something, and...
2) 289) dialog: I thought it would be nice.
2) 291) dialog: Are we expecting David to turn up? Jenny shrugs.
2) 293) dialog: (doubtful)
2) 302) dialog: Who'd like a piece? In truth, the cake is a rather sorry and unappetising specimen. There isn't enough icing on the top. She cuts a couple of slices which immediately collapse.
3) 8) text: Makes your dictionary look a bit feeble, eh Graham? Graham looks pained. Marjorie notices. MARJORIE
3) 15) text: (stung) I'd better be going I have a stack of homework to do. Graham says his goodbyes. He tries to catch Jenny's eye, but she looks away. Marjorie shows him to the door. DAVID
3) 20) text: Can I open anything yet? Marjorie comes back into the room. MARJORIE
3) 32) text: (bitterly) You've just said you don't like Europe. What's going to change? It'll have to be Europe, won't it? Because it isn't going to be you. MARJORIE
5) 131) text: Thanks. MARJORIE
5) 134) text: Who? Marjorie rolls her eyes. MARJORIE
5) 139) text: David's asked you to marry him? Bloody hell. Pardon my French. MARJORIE
5) 209) dialog: Jack!
5) 234) dialog: You have to put the cosy on                               straight away.                                            Jenny sighs and rolls her eyes. She picks up the hand- knitted tea-cosy and puts it on her head.
5) 236) dialog: (oblivious)                                          
5) 242) text: Jenny! We could walk to...(She              tries to think of somewhere Jenny           might find interesting.) We could           walk to the British Museum!                 Jenny gives her a look.                               MARJORIE                         
5) 276) text: I'm not sure he sees plenty of                        nice places.                                          Would you like a radiogram for a wedding present? We love ours. Something about this depresses Jenny. Marjorie notices. MARJORIE
5) 280) text: Why don't you three go out? I'll be happy here with a tin of... David enters the room. He is relaxed, happy. He has worn tie, possibly because he knew that Jack would wear a tie. Jack and Marjorie stand, and they exchange greetings. DAVID
5) 293) dialog: Of course. Eamonn Andrews is the poshest person that Jack can imagine being.
5) 350) text: Jenny, I can get a divorce. Everything will turn out for   the best. You'll see. We can see Jack and Marjorie peering through the lace curtains anxiously. JENNY
5) 383) dialog: Did you see her?
5) 396) dialog: (to Jack)
