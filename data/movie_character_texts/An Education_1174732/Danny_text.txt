He standing by the roulette table, talking to an even nastie looking man in a dark suit. They find a table at the back and sit down. A waitress comes over to their table.
5) 62) dialog: Oh-ho. Champagne, eh? He looks at Jenny and David expectantly.
5) 66) dialog: Fantastic.
5) 75) dialog: Well, I'm not sure you'd want him                        to marry your sister.

5) 415) dialog: I tried to tell him. I'm not                             speaking to him now, if that's                           any consolation.                                        
5) 419) dialog: Ah, well if you want that sort of                        conversation...You watched David                         and I help ourselves to a map,                           and you didn't say much, either.                         He holds Jenny's gaze. She looks away.
