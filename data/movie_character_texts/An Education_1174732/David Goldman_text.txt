0) 37) dialog: Hello. Jenny ignores him.
0) 38) dialog: Listen. If you've got any sense, you wouldn't take a lift from a strange man.
0) 40) dialog: I am, however, a music lover, and I'm worried about your cello. So                          what I propose is, you put it in                          the car and walk alongside me.
0) 42) dialog: Ah. Good point. He winds down the other window and waves on the cars that have stopped behind him.
0) 43) dialog: How much does a new cello cost? Twenty pounds? Thirty? I don't know. Let's say thirty. He pulls out a wallet, takes out three ten-pound notes, hands them to her.
0) 44) dialog: There. Security. Jenny laughs and waves the money away. 7   EXT. STREET. NEAR SCHOOL. DAY. Later. The cello is in the back seat of the Bristol. Jenn is trotting alongside the car, while David leans nonchalantly across the passenger seat to talk to her whi driving.
0) 45) dialog: I'm David, by the way. She says nothing.
0) 46) dialog: And you are...?
0) 48) dialog: It's a Bristol. Not many of `em made. Jenny nods, but doesn't know how to respond.
0) 50) dialog: How did the concert go?
0) 52) dialog: What are you playing?
0) 55) dialog: Ah, Elgar. I often think it's a shame he spent so much time in Worcester, don't you? Worcester's too near Birmingham. And you can hear that in the music. There's a horrible Brummy accent in there, if you listen hard enough. Jenny looks at him and smiles. She hadn't expected him to be able to make Elgar jokes.
0) 56) dialog: Anyway, I'm not sure Elgar and                          Jews mix very well.                                    
0) 58) dialog: (smiling)
0) 61) dialog: Jump in.
0) 65) dialog: Where to, madam? Jenny makes a face.
0) 67) dialog: What a shame. We'll just make it last as long as we can.
0) 70) dialog: Smoke?
0) 72) dialog: I suppose cellists must go to a lot of concerts.
0) 74) dialog: Oh, they're real.
0) 76) dialog: Why don't we believe in them?
0) 78) dialog: Your father, this is?
0) 82) dialog: Which of course is what is so                           wonderful about them. Anyway, you'll go one day.
0) 85) dialog: Good for you. Which University?
0) 87) dialog: I studied at what I believe they call the University of Life. And I didn't get a very good degree there. Jenny smiles.
0) 141) dialog: Hello.
0) 143) dialog: How did it go?
0) 145) dialog: Always the mark of a cultural triumph. Listen. I'm glad I ran into you. What are you doing on Friday?
0) 147) dialog: I meant the evening.
0) 151) text: Because I'm going to listen to                        some Schubert in St John's, Smith                     Square. My friends Danny and                          Helen will be going too, so it wouldn't be...I'll tell you what. I'll come and pick you up, and if your mother and father disapprove, then you can have the tickets and go with one of them. How does that sound? Jenny doesn't know what to say. She looks at David, and h eagerness to please seems to convince her. JENNY
0) 152) text: Thank you. And I'd like you to take me. I'd like to go with someone who knows when to clap. DAVID
0) 153) text: I usually watch Danny. He knows that sort of thing. Jenny smiles. DAVID
0) 155) text: (flat disbelief) Supper. DAVID
0) 157) text: The trouble is, we'll already have eaten. DAVID
0) 205) text: Oh, and by the way...David's a Jew. A wandering Jew. So watch yourself. She   goes to the door. JACK
0) 206) text: (panic-stricken and shouting) What's she talking about? I've never said anything like that in my life! Anyway, it's just an expression! I'm not against the Jews! Jenny comes back in with David, who is dressed stylishly his early-60s young executive leisurewear - sports jacket slacks, cashmere sweater. He looks out of place - he is brighter and brasher than his surroundings, the most colourful thing in the room, and he seems intimidatingly exotic. David has obviously heard Jack's last line. DAVID
0) 207) text: (pleasantly) I'm glad to hear it. Hello. David                    Goldman.                                             He offers his hand. JACK
0) 209) text: Dad! David's hand is still extended - in his confusion and embarrassment, Jack hasn't yet taken it. He does so now, and shakes it for way too long. JACK
0) 212) text: (deadpan) You didn't tell me you had a sister, Jenny. General confusion, until David chuckles naughtily. Marjor giggles, and then offers her hand. DAVID
0) 214) text: I suppose I am, yes. They all sit down. DAVID
0) 217) text: I'm sorry, David. Can I get you a drink? DAVID
0) 220) text: No, no, nothing...It was more of a question, really. How would you get to St John's Smith Square                         from here? For future reference? DAVID
0) 222) text: Simple as that. DAVID
0) 227) text: Back by ten, please, David. She's usually in bed by then. Jenny winces. DAVID
0) 229) text: Oh, well, I suppose... DAVID
0) 231) text: Well, it's Friday night. And if you're going out to the West End... DAVID
0) 232) text: Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it. See you again. They exchange warm handshakes. He turns to Marjorie. Marjorie extends her hand. David takes it, but kisses it suavely,leaving her a little flustered. MARJORIE
0) 242) dialog: Hello hello. Are we late?                               
0) 245) dialog: Jenny, these are my friends Helen                        and Danny.                                              
0) 247) dialog: Shall we?                                               They walk into the hall.
0) 268) text: Anyway. It's too expensive for me, too. We don't have to worry about that. If you want something in South Ken, get David to take you shopping. JENNY
0) 273) dialog: I booked a table at Juliette's.                           Will that kill the mood, do you think?
0) 277) dialog: Juliette's it is, then. Heaven forbid that we should end the evening reflecting on our own mortality. Jenny smiles in delight. She's never met people like this
0) 280) text: Have you never heard "Chante Francoise Sagan"? Jenny shakes her head. Her eyes are wide - she's clearly awe-struck. David offers her a cigarette - a Gitane - whi she takes. He lights it for her while she's listening. DANNY
0) 286) text: (ignoring her) You must have seen her sing?                          Jenny shakes her head again and smiles. Where would she have seen Juliette Greco? Danny, meanwhile, is baffled. W hasn't seen Juliette Greco? DAVID
0) 288) text: But you should see her in Paris, not here. David will take you. DAVID
0) 292) text: It's wonderful to find a young person who wants to know things. There's so much I want you to see. They sip their drinks pensively, possibly to allow time f the double-entendre to disappear into the smoke. DAVID
0) 297) text: I love the pre-Raphaelites. DAVID
0) 299) text: Yes, of course. Rossetti and Burne-Jones, anyway. Not Holman Hunt, so much. He's so garish. Danny looks at her. There's clearly more to this schoolgi than he thought. DAVID
0) 309) dialog: Are you sure you're busy? Jenny hesitates.
0) 343) dialog: Oh, you know. We kept bumping into each other, and we became pals, and we've ended up doing a bit of work together, when it suits us.
0) 345) dialog: Property. A bit of art dealing. Some buying and selling. This and that... He stops the car.
0) 346) dialog: I'll be two seconds. He gets out of the car, and Jenny watches him as he cross the road.
0) 350) dialog: I'm sorry about that.
0) 352) dialog: They're clients.
0) 354) dialog: Jenny darling, even schwarzers have to live somewhere. And it's not as if they can rent off their own kind, is it? He starts the car and drives off.
0) 356) dialog: You don't need to. It's too boring. All you need to know is that I work in property so that I can take you to nice places. Jenny's POV of the black family in one window, and the little old lady disappearing from another.
0) 365) dialog: (whispers to Jenny)
0) 368) text: No further bids? DAVID
0) 371) text: Five hundred and fifty, madam?                       Thank you.                                           Jenny looks at David, who nods. AUCTIONEER                                
0) 375) text: Sold for six hundred and fifty                       guineas. Thank you.                                  He brings down the gavel, and a murmur goes around the room. Jenny is excited and giggly. David pats her on the back. AUCTIONEER                                
0) 384) dialog: Well done. A nerveless performance. Jenny beams. She's thrilled.
0) 395) text: That would be even more vulgar. DAVID
0) 397) text: Gosh, no. One day. When I'm good enough for it. DAVID
0) 399) text: Oh, David. You've never heard me. Danny stands up and stretches. DAVID
0) 401) text: We should all go and spend a weekend in Oxford. Straw boaters, punting, cream teas, antiquarian bookshops. Bit of business, if we can find it. What about next weekend? DAVID/HELEN
0) 403) text: A weekend away? I wouldn't be allowed to do that. They all look at her. DAVID
0) 409) dialog: Oxford. Jenny   hoots with derision. JENNY
0) 411) dialog: We'll see. JENNY
0) 413) dialog: How much? DANNY
0) 416) dialog: You're on. They shake hands. Jenny suddenly notice the clock on Danny's mantelpiece. JENNY
0) 417) text: Mon dieu! You must take me back to school. And I've got to change back into my uniform. There is a silence. Danny and David make momentary eye contact - they are clearly contemplating the erotic possibilities of Jenny's last sentence. Helen notices. HELEN
2) 20) dialog: I don't think I'm very good at                           Eccles.                                                 
2) 23) text: (impatiently)                                  But what's he doing here? DAVID
2) 33) text: You didn't tell me David went to Oxford. Jenny looks at David, who stares back at her straight- faced. JENNY
2) 36) dialog: For all the good it did me.
2) 38) dialog: Oh, English. Just like every other semi-employed layabout in London.
2) 40) dialog: Merton.
2) 43) dialog: I was just telling Jack that I'm going back next weekend. I go and see my old professor every now and again.
2) 45) dialog: Too true. And Clive would love Jenny. Have you ever come across Clive Lewis?
2) 47) dialog: I just thought he might know some of the books.
2) 52) text: CS Lewis? That's the Clive you're talking about? DAVID
2) 54) text: Jenny used to love those books. DAVID
2) 56) text: I'd love to meet him. There is a pause. Jack and Marjorie look at the floor. Somehow, David has manoeuvred a situation where, effectively, he is the one being asked. DAVID
2) 59) text: How often do you see him? DAVID
2) 65) dialog: Well, I wouldn't want to drive back after one of those Oxford dinners. Jack chuckles knowingly.
2) 66) dialog: Clive will get her a room in college. That's easy enough.
2) 70) dialog: I'd be delighted. Jack, Marjorie and Jenny all beam.
2) 74) dialog: I told you. You owe me half-a- crown. He kisses her on the cheek and disappears into the night.
2) 77) dialog: Come on!
2) 81) dialog: How can they only be nearly ready?
2) 110) dialog: Maybe later. There are a couple of things we have to do. 44   INT/EXT. CAR OXFORD BACK STREET. DAY. Jenny and Helen in the back seat of the car, which is parked outside a house in the back streets of Oxford. There's no sign of Danny and David. Jenny sighs impatiently.
2) 117) text: (attempting, briefly, to be patient) No, we...Never mind. David walks over to the nearest table and writes in the book. DAVID
2) 131) text: I wouldn't worry, Jenny. You're wasting your breath. DAVID
2) 133) text: Absolutely. This would be a good place to do a little business. David catches Jenny's eye. This isn't what he meant by "getting a feel for the place." DANNY
2) 135) text: Please explain what stats are. You're always going on about them. DAVID
2) 139) dialog: Let's not talk about curtains. You look beautiful. You really are a princess. Jenny was about to get into bed, but his tone makes her pause at the edge of the bed.
2) 141) dialog: I think that's good. I think that's right. And for your seventeenth birthday I'm going to take you to Paris or Rome or Florence and make you feel like the most beautiful princess in the kingdom of love. But we can still be romantic, can't we?
2) 143) dialog: Minnie....
2) 146) dialog: Yes. You're my Minnie Mouse, and I'm your bubbalub.
2) 148) dialog: Minnie.
2) 150) dialog: (prompting)
2) 153) dialog: Would you mind if I had a look at what might one day be mine? Just a peek? His eyes stray to her breasts. Jenny stares at him.
2) 155) dialog: I just want to see them. Jenny, flustered and nervous, looks at her nightgown - sh doesn't know what to do.
2) 156) dialog: Let it fall from your shoulders. She does so. He stares.
2) 157) dialog: Thank you. He sits up, and lovingly lifts the straps back up. He smiles at her. Relieved, she smiles back.
2) 161) dialog: Might be worth a look.
2) 181) dialog: Oh, come on, Jenny. Let's not spoil things.
2) 184) dialog: I think there must be some kind of misunderstanding. Jenny shakes her head bitterly. They continue driving in silence.
2) 188) dialog: Jenny?
2) 190) text: No thanks. You go. I'll find my own way home. Jenny gets out of the car and starts up the road. David gets out and starts to chase after her.
2) 191) dialog: Jenny! He catches up with her in the street.
2) 192) dialog: It was an old map. A Speed. It was cooped up in that miserable little cottage, and she didn't even know what it was. What a waste! It shouldn't spend its life on a wall in wherever the hell we are. It should be with us. We know how to look after it properly. We liberated it. Jenny snorts derisively.
2) 194) dialog: (quickly and passionately)
2) 197) dialog: And if you don't like it, then I will understand, and you can go back to Twickenham and listen to                        the Home Service and do your Latin homework. But these weekends, and the restaurants and the concerts..They don't grow on trees. Jenny looks at him, startled. Trees again?
2) 198) dialog: Do you understand? Of course you do. This is who we are, Jenny. He turns to face her and holds out his hand. On Jenny: is she in or out? Jenny takes his hand. David pulls her towards him, holds her around the waist and begins to dan with her. Further up the pavement, Helen and Danny watch, laughing.
2) 200) dialog: I suppose you have homework to do.
2) 202) dialog: (surprised, despite his speech earlier)
2) 207) text: You have no idea how boring everything was before I met you. DAVID
2) 209) text: Excitement's a lot, when you're at school and you live in Twickenham. DAVID
2) 211) text: But that is who you are. I've never met anyone like you. Action is character, our English teacher says. DAVID
2) 213) text: I think it means that if we never did anything, we wouldn't be anybody. And I never did anything before I met you. And sometimes I think no-one's ever done anything in this stupid country, apart from you. DAVID
2) 232) text: Never a dull moment with David, is there? If it's not concerts, it's famous authors. Bit different from that lad you brought home for tea, isn't he? MARJORIE
2) 233) text: David's a lot older than Graham. JACK
2) 238) text: Well, it says something about you, doesn't it? It says you're going places. It says you're well connected. He's an impressive young man, that David. I like him more and more. MARJORIE
2) 271) text: They don't know yet. David's got a plan, he says. He usually has something up his sleeve.
2) 275) text: Oh, it was....(She changes her mind) David went to Oxford. Merton. English. And he offered to show me round.
2) 307) text: Oh dear.                                                  The doorbell rings. Jenny perks up. Jack goes to answer i and immediately the house is energised: it's David.
3) 2) dialog: It's a special day.
3) 4) text: She's a special girl. DAVID
3) 6) text: This is Graham. DAVID
3) 7) text: Graham, a pleasure. I'm David. They shake hands. Graham suddenly looks five years younge JACK
3) 12) text: David, what can I get you to drink? DAVID
3) 15) text: (stung) I'd better be going I have a stack of homework to do. Graham says his goodbyes. He tries to catch Jenny's eye, but she looks away. Marjorie shows him to the door. DAVID
3) 18) text: A glass of something warming? DAVID
3) 21) text: Wait for me. DAVID
3) 23) text: (flatly) Lovely. DAVID
3) 35) text: Oh, for God's sake. Jack looks cornered. He needs to find a way out. DAVID
3) 37) text: Aunt Helen? The one who went to                      the concert with you?                                DAVID
3) 39) text: (relieved) Well, there we are. DAVID
3) 43) dialog: (the penny apparently dropping)
3) 46) dialog: Oh, impossible. I hadn't thought it through properly. I do apologise, Jack. Would you prefer it if Helen took Jenny on her own? I don't mind. I've been to Paris before.
3) 66) dialog: Ah. I pushed the boat out and got us a suite.
3) 68) dialog: Well, if work stops us getting to Paris until tomorrow, then work can buy us a nice hotel room. Anyway, it's a special occasion, isn't it?
3) 72) dialog: Hold on a second. I've got something. Rather absurdly, he half-disappears over the side of the bed, reaching for something on the floor. He comes back with a banana. Jenny stares at him.
3) 74) dialog: I thought....I thought we might want to practice. Jenny shrieks with horror.
3) 76) dialog: I thought we'd get the messy bit over with first.
3) 78) dialog: I'm sorry. David attempts to kiss her again. Jenny wriggles clear.
3) 80) dialog: I'm sorry, Minnie. I'm such a fool. Jenny doesn't deny it.
3) 83) dialog: (alarmed)
3) 86) dialog: (relieved)
3) 91) dialog: (cheered up)

5) 4) dialog: And it wasn't too uncomfortable?
5) 53) dialog: Yes. Perec Rachman. He's a....
5) 55) dialog: He's a business acquaintance, and we need to talk to him.
5) 61) dialog: A bottle of champagne, please.
5) 63) dialog: Don't be bashful.
5) 65) dialog: All right, then. If you won't tell them I will. Jenny got two As and a B in her mock-A levels.
5) 70) dialog: The B was in Latin. But it's much better than it was, isn't it, Minnie? Rachman is now standing on his own. Danny nudges David, a they go over to talk to him just as the champagne arrives The waiter pops the bottle of champagne and pours two glasses. The girls smile and clink glasses.
5) 78) dialog: This is the one, Danny.
5) 80) dialog: You can see she's different. She's got everything. You've got Helen, and....
5) 84) dialog: (rumbled)
5) 93) dialog: Jenny, we should go. It's late.
5) 98) dialog: (to Danny)
5) 99) text: You're all right in a taxi, aren't you? He guides Jenny firmly out of the club. 77   EXT. CLUB. NIGHT. Jenny is about to to open the passenger door of the Bristol, but David stops her.
5) 100) dialog: Wait there. He runs to the back of the car, opens the boot and starts rummaging through it. It seems to be full of everything but the thing he's looking for.
5) 102) dialog: Will you marry me? Jenny stares at him for a moment, then laughs.
5) 104) dialog: I thought I had a ring. It wouldn't have been the right one. But it would have done for tonight.
5) 106) text: Oh, David.
5) 107) dialog: I'm serious.
5) 109) dialog: What do you think?
5) 112) text: Please take me home. She gets into the car. We see the desperation in David's face, lit by the headlights of a passing taxi, as he slam the door on Jenny after she's got in.
5) 137) text: David? JENNY
5) 139) text: David's asked you to marry him? Bloody hell. Pardon my French. MARJORIE
5) 226) dialog: I thought that, too! I was wondering whether he might be a bit jealous.
5) 230) dialog: You may have noticed that Helen's not really Oxford material. I'm going to keep him out of your way. They both smile. David opens the door for Jenny and she gets into the car.
5) 232) dialog: I haven't put my...my stamp on it                         yet. Haven't had time. It needs a                         woman's touch, really. And if you                         don't like it, we can move. Just                          say the word.
