0) 11) dialog: I don't want to hear anything through the ceiling this afternoon, apart from the sound of sweat dripping onto textbooks.
0) 13) dialog: No cello.
0) 15) dialog: It's already your interest or hobby. When they ask you "What's your interest or hobby?" at your Oxford interview, you can say, "Cello". That wouldn't be a lie. You don't need to practise a hobby. A hobby is a hobby.
0) 17) dialog: (ignoring her)
0) 21) dialog: No. The orchestra shows you're a joiner-inner. Universities like joiner-inners.
0) 23) dialog: Well, if you stop, that shows the opposite, doesn't it? That shows you're a rebel. They don't want that at Oxford.
0) 25) dialog: (missing the sarcasm, as is his wont)
0) 92) text: She's fine, thanks. She sends her best, by the way. JACK
0) 94) text: I'm not sure yet. JACK
0) 97) text: I might take a year off. Jenny winces. Jack looks at him as if he's just said he'l take all his clothes off. JACK
0) 99) text: (mumbling) I don't know. Maybe do some travelling, that sort of thing. JACK
0) 100) text: Travelling? What are you, a teddy boy? Close-up of Jenny - she knows what's coming, and can't be it. Beat. JACK
0) 103) dialog: So she's studying English at Oxford while you're a wandering Jew... Jenny looks at him curiously. Graham steels himself to speak.
0) 116) text: Yes, he is, really. Jack stares at the flowers in disbelief. The bunch of flowers has created in Jack the kind of panic and fear mo typically associated with a biochemical attack. JACK
0) 118) text: (drily, knowing the trouble this will cause) Jack,I'm afraid Jenny has been sent some flowers by a chap. JACK
0) 120) text: (patiently) He's wishing me luck for tonight. JACK
0) 122) text: He earns it, I expect. JACK
0) 124) text: Can we just go? Otherwise the bunch of good-luck flowers will actually be responsible for me actually missing the concert. Which would be ironic, n'est ce pas? JACK
0) 129) dialog: Ten bob's worth of luck, I reckon. That's a lot for a schoolgirl. You can't leave them out here, anyway. I'd burgle a house that had flowers outside. They'll think we're made of money.
0) 179) dialog: I won't allow it!
0) 182) dialog: (uncertainly)
0) 185) dialog: Where is it?
0) 187) dialog: Where's that?
0) 190) text: It's in Westminster. Just around                     the corner from the Abbey.                           Jack looks at her as if she'd just given directions to th nearest opium den. JACK
0) 193) text: He soon put a stop to that. JACK
0) 195) text: Where are we? JACK                                      
0) 197) text: The trouble is, that's where St                      John's Smith Square is.                              JACK
0) 199) text: Jack, she wants to see someone who can play. She doesn't want to see Sheila Kirkland scratching away. I'll take her. JACK
0) 201) text: That's him. Now what? JACK
0) 203) text: Jack!
0) 205) text: Oh, and by the way...David's a Jew. A wandering Jew. So watch yourself. She   goes to the door. JACK
0) 206) text: (panic-stricken and shouting) What's she talking about? I've never said anything like that in my life! Anyway, it's just an expression! I'm not against the Jews! Jenny comes back in with David, who is dressed stylishly his early-60s young executive leisurewear - sports jacket slacks, cashmere sweater. He looks out of place - he is brighter and brasher than his surroundings, the most colourful thing in the room, and he seems intimidatingly exotic. David has obviously heard Jack's last line. DAVID
0) 207) text: (pleasantly) I'm glad to hear it. Hello. David                    Goldman.                                             He offers his hand. JACK
0) 209) text: Dad! David's hand is still extended - in his confusion and embarrassment, Jack hasn't yet taken it. He does so now, and shakes it for way too long. JACK
0) 210) text: I'm sorry. What I'm saying is that you're not the sort of, of person I'd be against, if I were the sort of person who was against...people. You're not an old...Oh, dear. I'm Jack, and this is Marjorie.
0) 213) text: You're a lucky man, Jack. JACK
0) 218) text: I'd love one, Jack, but we're running a little late. If Jenny's ready, perhaps we'll shoot off. Jenny looks at her father, and takes a calculated gamble. JENNY
0) 219) text: Ah. Well. Dad's got something to tell you. JACK
0) 221) text: Oh, it's a pretty straight run, really. Up to Hammersmith, take                       the A4 through Kensington and                         you're there.                                         JACK
0) 226) dialog: (still smiling) No. Beat. JACK
0) 228) text: I was hoping Jenny would come with me afterwards to have a bite of supper with my aunt Helen. Jenny studies him carefully. Suddenly his friends Danny a Helen have become `Aunt Helen'. JACK
0) 230) text: How about if I promise to have her in by eleven thirty? JACK
0) 232) text: Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it. See you again. They exchange warm handshakes. He turns to Marjorie. Marjorie extends her hand. David takes it, but kisses it suavely,leaving her a little flustered. MARJORIE
0) 236) dialog: (sniffing the air)
0) 239) dialog: At least there's no confusion, if you smell of carbolic soap. Marjorie rolls her eyes.
0) 407) text: Jack and Marjorie. JENNY
1) 6) dialog: It's her Latin, isn't it?
1) 9) dialog: And you still say I shouldn't go down there and have it out with whatsername? The Latin teacher? Because this is hopeless.
1) 12) dialog: What if their best isn't good enough, though, eh? What do we do then?
1) 14) dialog: Perhaps it's all a waste of time and money anyway.
1) 16) dialog: Well, what's she going to do with an English degree? And if she's going to spend three years playing that bloody cello and talking in French to beatniks, then I'm throwing good money after bad. I suppose she might meet a nice lawyer. But she could do that at a dinner dance tomorrow.
1) 19) dialog: Is anyone listening to me? How much is that going to cost me?
1) 21) text: Five shillings an hour. Maybe a little more for A-level. JACK
1) 23) text: And what else are we spending five bob on? What else are we spending sixpence on? JACK
1) 25) text: It was, actually. It was a present from Auntie Vi. JACK
1) 27) text: Jack... JACK
2) 19) dialog: Oh. Hello. David does the most brilliant Bluebottle, Jenny. Actually, he can do all the                              Goons.                                                  
2) 21) dialog: Oh, no, you've got him...                               
2) 25) text: (incredulous) You came to see Mum and Dad? JACK
2) 27) text: And you're drinking? But it's not Christmas! JACK
2) 30) text: I'm trying to think what you missed. Nothing much comes to mind. JACK
2) 32) text: Anyway. Would you excuse me? I've got a huge pile of Latin translation to do. JACK
2) 37) dialog: What did you read?
2) 39) dialog: (marvelling at the coincidence) English! Which college?
2) 44) dialog: That's what you need, Jenny. Someone on the inside track. It's not always what you know, is it, David?
2) 49) dialog: (stung) What's he written?
2) 56) text: I'd love to meet him. There is a pause. Jack and Marjorie look at the floor. Somehow, David has manoeuvred a situation where, effectively, he is the one being asked. DAVID
2) 57) text: I'm sorry. I'm being slow on the uptake. Would Jenny like to come with me at the weekend? JACK
2) 63) dialog: (dubiously)
2) 69) dialog: Would it be a bother to you, David?
2) 218) dialog: Here she is! The wanderer returns!
2) 221) dialog: Was he nice to you? Jenny unzips her bag and pulls out her copy of the book. She hands it to her father.
2) 223) dialog: Well I never. Look at this, Marjorie. He hands it to her. She examines it reverently.
2) 231) text: Did it make you want to work harder? JACK
2) 233) text: David's a lot older than Graham. JACK
2) 235) text: He might become a famous author, for all you know. JACK
2) 237) text: What? JACK
2) 239) text: Well, they say opposites attract, don't they? I wouldn't have thought he was your sort. JACK
2) 281) dialog: Is David taking you somewhere special tonight?
2) 286) dialog: What do we want him round for?
2) 292) dialog: It might not be a bad thing if he did.
2) 295) dialog: Well, if you think about it, there's more than one way of skinning a cat.
2) 297) dialog: No, of course...                                      
2) 301) dialog: Blow them out, then, before the whole place burns down. Jenny closes her eyes, makes her wish, blows out her candles. Her father and mother both look at her, apparent attempting to read her mind. Jack gets up to turn the lights on. We can see that by Jenny's side are two unopened, carefully-wrapped presents, both exactly the sa size - clearly books.
2) 304) dialog: Come on. Presents. Without any real enthusiasm, Jenny opens the first one of the two, from her mum and dad. It's a Latin dictionary.
2) 307) text: Oh dear.                                                  The doorbell rings. Jenny perks up. Jack goes to answer i and immediately the house is energised: it's David.
3) 1) dialog: Good grief. You won't believe this, Jenny. Did you leave anything in the shop? David enters. You can hardly see him for all the parcels and flowers he's carrying.
3) 7) text: Graham, a pleasure. I'm David. They shake hands. Graham suddenly looks five years younge JACK
3) 9) text: And ours too, come to that. JACK
3) 11) text: Clearly. JACK
3) 13) text: What's everybody else having? What have you got there, Graham? JACK
3) 22) text: Before you start on that little lot , I have a surprise. Next weekend, we're all going to Chez Georges to celebrate Jenny's birthday. JACK
3) 24) text: Chez Georges is in the Boulevard St Germain. In Paris. Jenny giggles her delight. Jack's smile is a little more forced. JACK
3) 26) text: You know the one, Dad. JACK
3) 28) text: Dad! JACK
3) 33) text: I can take her. JACK
3) 35) text: Oh, for God's sake. Jack looks cornered. He needs to find a way out. DAVID
3) 36) text: Listen, I'm really sorry to have caused all this to-do. I just thought it might be nice. But I'll go with Aunt Helen and Uncle Daniel. They can have your tickets. Jack looks at him. JACK
3) 38) text: Yes, that's the one. JACK
3) 42) dialog: Aunt Helen! Don't you see? If Aunt Helen's going to be there...
3) 45) dialog: I didn't want to put a spoke in anyone's wheels. But if you look at it from my angle...A bachelor,                         taking my daughter off to Paris...
3) 47) dialog: Oh, I couldn't possibly ask...No, no. If Aunt Helen's going... He smiles broadly. He's off the hook. Jenny catches David eye and smiles.
5) 123) dialog: Oh, aye. The potting shed. Who does he think I am? Prince Rainier of Monaco?
5) 125) dialog: Married?
5) 129) text: Would it? That's interesting. JACK
5) 133) text: Yes. JACK
5) 136) text: Nothing yet. JACK
5) 138) text: No. A man I just met walking his dog. JACK
5) 140) text: Do you have any choice? Or is it too late. She looks at her daughter knowingly. Jack merely looks confused. JACK
5) 144) dialog: Well. Looked at it one way, you wouldn't really need to go now, would you? He's a man going places. And say what you like, but they know how to take care of their money, don't they? He'll see you're looked after.
5) 147) dialog: You know what I mean. Jenny laughs bitterly. She can't believe it.
5) 149) dialog: We don't know about nightclubs. We knew about education. Anyway, it all turned out for the best.
5) 151) dialog: He wouldn't have wanted you if you were thick, would he? Jenny stares at them and walks out.
5) 201) dialog: How d'you mean, left? Jenny doesn't answer.
5) 202) dialog: What about your exams?
5) 204) dialog: What are we going to tell people?
5) 208) dialog: All that... Marjorie knows what he's going to say, and doesn't want h to.
5) 210) dialog: No. No need for Jack. She should hear it. All that money! Do you know how much it's cost me for you to go through school and take no exams?
5) 212) dialog: You know what your trouble is, don't you? You're too clever by half.
5) 277) text: You won't be bored, you know. He's not boring. Now they are both thoughtful. As if on cue, Jack comes in the sitting room, pulling at his tie, looking apprehensiv He appears to be wearing Brylcreem. He looks like a littl boy who has been made to put on his Sunday best. JACK
5) 279) text: We've been through this, Dad. It'll be quite clearly marked on the menu. The doorbell rings. Jack stiffens. Jenny goes to answer t door. JACK
5) 280) text: Why don't you three go out? I'll be happy here with a tin of... David enters the room. He is relaxed, happy. He has worn tie, possibly because he knew that Jack would wear a tie. Jack and Marjorie stand, and they exchange greetings. DAVID
5) 281) text: Everybody ready? I think you'll like this place, Jack. Their wine list is as good as anything I've seen in London. JACK
5) 286) dialog: I was hoping you'd take us in this.
5) 291) dialog: I feel like Eamonn Andrews.
5) 303) dialog: Do you think we should offer him some petrol money? Or would he feel insulted? Jenny watches David as he dials the number. He notices he waves, puts the money in the slot.
5) 304) dialog: He'd feel insulted, probably. He said tonight was his treat. That must include the petrol, for God's sakes? David starts to talk, and turns away, as if he's frighten that someone in the car can lip-read.
5) 305) dialog: What do you think? Nobody pays him any attention. They lapse into silence. Jack starts to fiddle with the features in the car - a table springs down from the seat in front of him, much to his alarm.
5) 306) dialog: God almighty. What have I done?
5) 315) dialog: What's going on?
5) 317) dialog: What's happened?
5) 323) dialog: (desperately)
5) 350) text: Jenny, I can get a divorce. Everything will turn out for   the best. You'll see. We can see Jack and Marjorie peering through the lace curtains anxiously. JENNY
5) 358) dialog: What's going on?
5) 360) dialog: He just drove off. We close slowly in on Jenny's face. But of course he'd drive off!
5) 361) dialog: (pathetic)
5) 385) dialog: Well we've got to have this out. If you won't do it, I will. He starts for the door.
5) 389) dialog: I beg your pardon? I'm still your father, Jenny.
5) 391) dialog: We didn't... He gives up hopelessly. Marjorie says nothing.
5) 393) dialog: That doesn't mean....what I think it means, does it? It can't.
5) 395) dialog: Just tell me that you didn't...you haven't, you know...You didn't....                                    Jenny looks at him in disbelief.
5) 401) dialog: Jenny. She continue to put her David-life away into bags. She ignores him.
5) 403) dialog: There's a cup of tea for you here. No answer. He puts the tea on the floor, and sits down ne to it.
5) 404) dialog: I know I made a mess of everything. He waits for an answer - nothing.
5) 405) dialog: All my life I've been scared, and I didn't want you to be scared. That's why I wanted you to go to Oxford. So that if someone asked you out to a nice restaurant, you wouldn't panic about what was a starter and what was a main course. And then David came along, and he had money, and he knew famous writers, and he knew how to get to classical music concerts. But he wasn't who he said he was. He wasn't who you said he was, either.
5) 409) dialog: The other day, your mother and I were listening to a programme about CS Lewis on the radio, and they said he moved to Cambridge in 1954. And I said to Marjorie, Well, they've got that wrong, because how would our Jenny get her book signed, if he wasn't in Oxford?
5) 411) dialog: Jenny, I'm sorry.
