58) 35) text: A long low stucco building in an industrial section of Lo Angeles. The company name is on the glass of the main doo KAGGS, a humorless hotshot of 28, dressed in short-sleeve white shirt and narrow dark tie, prowls the cracked sidew in front of the place, MAKING REMARKS into a small casset recorder. Roy's Honda arrives and drives into the company at the end of the building. Kaggs watches, then goes on patrolling and TALKING into the recorder. Roy comes out t the sidewalk and heads for the entrance. Kaggs stops and watches him approach.
58) 39) dialog: (uptight, minimal) Hello.
58) 68) text: The clerks all hurry back to their desks as Kaggs enters. crosses to Roy, hand stuck out.
58) 70) dialog: Kaggs. Home office.
58) 74) dialog: (keeping Roy's hand) I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
58) 75) text: Kaggs moves toward the gate in the rail, still holding Ro hand, to move him along. Roy stands still, which yanks Ka back. Kaggs frowns at him, releases his hand.
58) 77) dialog: What's up?
58) 81) dialog: (brisk) You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
58) 84) text: Kaggs leads the way through the rail.
59) 1) text: Small, crowded, efficient, with interior windows showing aisles of bins. Kaggs leads Roy in, shuts the door, gestu at the second chair as he goes behind the desk.
59) 3) dialog: Take a seat.
59) 6) dialog: When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
59) 10) dialog: Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
59) 14) dialog: That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
59) 19) dialog: I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
59) 24) dialog: That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
59) 28) dialog: (astonished) No?
59) 32) dialog: I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
59) 36) dialog: I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
59) 39) text: Kaggs gets to his feet, terminating the meeting.
59) 41) dialog: See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
59) 44) text: Kaggs sticks his hand out for another shake. Roy obliges.
59) 46) dialog: And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
103) 1) text: Kaggs sits at his computer terminal, bringing up data, no pleased by what he sees. Buzzer SOUNDS. He swivels to the desk, presses the intercom button.
103) 3) dialog: Yeah?
103) 7) dialog: Good! Send him in.
103) 8) text: With a now-we're-getting-somewhere manner, Kaggs turns ba to the VDT, punches up a different set of data, sits look at it in gloomy satisfaction. Roy enters, and Kaggs rises extending his hand across the desk. They shake hands.
103) 10) dialog: Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
103) 14) dialog: (keen) You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
103) 18) dialog: Oh, come on, Roy.
103) 22) dialog: Perk, remember?
103) 26) dialog: A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
103) 30) dialog: (deep sigh) Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you. (forced laugh) Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
103) 34) dialog: That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
