14) 0) text: A bright, sunny day... THROUGH a glass window we see and hear two children out playing in the yard. A Norman Rockwell, picture-perfect setting... A young boy and a teenage girl romp in the grass, then up to the window steps a beautiful woman, fresh from the garden. It's obvious she's the mother of these two. Over the giggling of the kids she smiles at ARTHUR KRITICOS, 50, sitting inside his bedroom, in a very comfortable chair, taking in his family with pride. We PAN TO Arthur as he smiles, content... A sharp KNOCK on the bedroom door breaks the mood, and Arthur turns. Our UNCUT CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO the door. As it does, it SWEEPS ACROSS a desk decorated with family photos, one of which is the woman at the window. CAMERA CONTINUES TO the door, where we notice the wall and door around KATHY, Arthur's 21-year-old daughter, has somehow aged from the pristine room we thought we were in. Kathy sticks her head in. Pretty if she ever had time to fix her hair, clad in a University of Calumny sweatshirt. She stirs a pan of burnt scrambled eggs.
15) 0) text: Arthur comes out of the bathroom and beholds, in the kitchenette of his small, cramped three-bedroom apartment... A blur of activity: Kathy cooks at the stove, his son BOBBY, 7, eats a bowl of cereal at the kitchen table, while scanning the obituary section of the newspaper. He records the different, humorous deaths with a microphone and a tape recorder. In the b.g., on the TELEVISION, a black and white horror movie drones on (the original Thirteen Ghosts). The nanny, MAGGIE, 26, just gets in the way... wiping the counter, pouring the OJ, setting the table. It's a very disorganized way of doing things. She's trying, sort of, but we can see from Kathy's body language that she's at her wits' end with the woman.
15) 6) dialog: ‘Morning, everyone!
15) 8) dialog: That's nice. Maggie ruffles Bobby's hair. Arthur pours himself a cup of coffee, sidles up to Kathy.

15) 12) dialog: Kathy, it's healthy.

15) 23) dialog: Hey, Edgar Allan Poe, you finish your homework? Mr. Petersen tells me you aren't -- ... trips on Bobby's scooter. The hot coffee spills all over him. He falls back into the counter, knocking the pan of eggs to the floor.
15) 24) dialog: Jesus Christ, that's the third time I tripped on that thing, Bobby. Get it off the floor before it kills someone.
15) 29) dialog: (overhearing her) Well, we don't have a bigger place, so let's just keep our stuff off the floor. Alright? Arthur wipes off his pants, but it's just one big stain. Suddenly, there's a BUZZ at the DOOR. Everyone goes silent... Kathy looks to Arthur, who checks his watch.
15) 30) dialog: Shit... I forgot, the lawyer.
15) 32) dialog: No, no. It's not that. Arthur goes to the door, mopping his crotch.

22) 0) text: An enormous and majestic house made of glass nestled amongst pine trees. Stark against the evening sky, the house is awe-inspiring. Even for an English teacher, Arthur has a hard time finding the words. There's also a Power & Light truck parked in front.

The locking mechanism, visible within the glass, beckons. Arthur turns the key. As it turns, we hear the MECHANISM CLICK and WHIR. Then, oddly, the key is sucked into the keyhole, Everyone and vanishes. looks at the now-empty keyhole, then at each other, then back at the keyhole. (CONTINUED )

26) 2) dialog: Apparently Cyrus wasn't too keen on privacy.
27) 2) dialog: (under his breath) Latin...
27) 4) dialog: Yeah. That occurred to me. With a huge smile Bobby reaches for an ancient samurai sword on display. Arthur catches him in mid act.
27) 5) dialog: In your dreams, kiddo. (CONTINUED )
27) 9) dialog: Okay. First rule. No throwing stones.
27) 13) dialog: Don't touch anything. At least until we got some property insurance. He places Bobby down beside Kathy and Maggie.

29) 38) dialog: Hey, buddy. You okay? Rafkin looks around, registering where he is. On the floor.
33) 0) text: Rafkin and Arthur also witness a change. From their perspective, they can see from the inside what the outside was doing. It's obvious by their shared looks that maybe it's time to take their argument outside. (CONTINUED )
33) 4) dialog: I'll take your word for it. They quickly rush out of the study, and over to the entryway. But the kids and Maggie are not there...

44) 23) dialog: Kathy, just this once, don't argue.
45) 2) dialog: Son of a bitch. Arthur picks up a chair and hurls it at the glass. It bounces off without a dent. He picks it up and starts banging away. Nothing. Over the top of the noise a voice bellows out.
45) 3) dialog: What a night I'm having!
45) 5) dialog: What do you mean it's sealed shut?
45) 12) dialog: Well, we're gonna look again... right after we find my son. Now get up...
45) 14) dialog: Look, I don't know what the hell's going on and I don't know who the hell you are... but my son's missing. So until those questions are answered, you're not leaving my sight. Now get up. Rafkin is startled by Arthur's tone. He reluctantly gets up to help.

52) 0) text: The group comes to the bottom of the stairs, then moves into the glass-lined passage. Rafkin's head is beginning to throb again. Arthur, taking note.

Other spaces are dimly visible through the glass. He looks around. No way out. Then, on the other side of the glass wall, he sees Arthur moving down the passage on the other side.

62) 11) dialog: 
62) 13) dialog: Kathy! What is it? I can't see a thing! Arthur grabs Kathy, tries to drag her away. But the Jackal won't let go. Kathy is hoisted in the air between the two, a tug of war that's killing her. Arthur won't let go of her hands and the invisible Jackal won't let go of her feet. Bloody scratches rip open along her legs as her clothes are ripped to shreds.
62) 15) dialog: Where is it?! Kathy, tell me where it is -- (CONTINUED )
62) 18) dialog: Jesus Christ, get off! Get off! Hysterical, Arthur finally pulls Kathy up and drags her down the passage. The Jackal leaps again, yanking her fro Arthur's grasp. Arthur barely catches hold of Kathy's arm and pulls. But the Jackal's too strong... and he's losing her... Suddenly, the corridor lights up behind him, and a phosphorous flare is tossed to the floor beside him. The JACKAL SHRIEKS with unearthly horror! A second set of hands grabs hold of Kathy and pulls alongside Arthur. Arthur turns and comes face-to-face with Kalina, knapsack slung over her shoulder, glasses on her face. He does a double-take, then --
62) 19) dialog: Who the hell're you?
62) 27) dialog: Just who the hell are you, how the hell did you get in here, and what the hell was that!? CuT TO:
63) 0) text: The duo weave their way through the basement's maze of glass trying to locate Arthur and Kathy. Rafkin pulls Maggie along, trying to find the way out, but it's no use. The hallways all look the same. Pulling her around a corner, they find themselves trapped. A glass barrier cuts them off from the rest of the corridor.
64) 3) dialog: Spiritua-recla-what?
64) 5) dialog: Forget my uncle, and trapped souls for a second. What in the world are you doing here?

64) 17) dialog: But if you got in --
64) 23) dialog: What're you talking about?
66) 2) dialog: Look, I don't give a damn about any machine, any devil, anybody named Basileus anything except getting my family the hell out of here. Now if that book showed you how to get in, can it show us how to get out?
66) 6) dialog: Good. Good. Finally. We're on to something here. We're communicating. This is good. All we need is a little cooperation from you and that book, and we can all go home. Correct?

72) 14) dialog: How many of these do you have left?
72) 16) dialog: Three? You couldn't have brought a few more? (CONTINUED )
72) 23) dialog: Where is it from here? Kalina shifts the book around to see where they are.
74) 0) text: Kalina's legs disappear through the ceiling. Arthur, holding out the flare, scans the basement around him. The figures still remain at bay. That's when the flare burns out. Arthur shakes it once, twice, then, knowing it's out for good, stands alone, helpless in the single patch of light coming from the ceiling. He looks to his left and sees the crab-like creature scurrying down the corridor. From the other direction comes a large silhouette (which is the Hammer).
74) 1) dialog: Ms. Ortezia...
75) 5) dialog: (calling up from below) Hey! Remember me?! Rafkin and Maggie peer into the hole and see Arthur below.

76) 52) dialog: So how many ghosts have been set free? Kalina checks the book.
76) 54) dialog: And it needs twelve ghosts to power it up? Rafkin shakes his head. (CONTINUED )

76) 84) dialog: In case you haven't been counting I'm out of time here. There aren't many options to consider, Mr. Psychic.
76) 86) dialog: You can go to hell!! You hear me, you son of a bitch!! To hell. All I can think about are my kids. Goddammit, I don't even know if they're alive...
76) 89) dialog: (to Kalina) No matter what happens to me, to us all, do you think you can stop the machine?
76) 93) dialog: Okay. How many flares do you have left?
76) 95) dialog: We're going out again.
76) 97) dialog: Not if we take that. Arthur points at one of the doors in the library. He and Rafkin remove the hinges off the spell-etched glass door, using the tools from the belt. Written inside are the spells. He hands the door to Rafkin.
77) 4) dialog: Ram him on three... Rafkin and Arthur brace themselves. The '50s Kid continues to whack away at the door.
77) 6) dialog: That's more like it. Arthur spots an opening behind them.
77) 7) dialog: This way... Arthur guides them down another corridor.

84) 5) dialog: Dennis!! Arthur sinks to his knees, crushed. He looks up and the ghosts are gone. He completely falls apart... Then suddenly, another ghost appears on the other side of the glass. Arthur looks up and sees -- Jean, as we saw her before, standing there, staring at him. Arthur looks at her, dumbstruck.
84) 6) dialog: Jean...? She tilts her head in response, sadness and longing in her face. Arthur can't hold it back anymore, a wave of emotion rushes over him and he bursts into tears.
84) 7) dialog: I'm so sorry... please forgive me... (sobbing) I should've went back in after you...
84) 9) dialog: I miss you so much... Arthur reaches out and places his hand against the glass to touch her on the other side, when...
87) 0) text: Arthur has his hand on the glass. Jean's about to put her hand against his, when the CHANTING sound hits her... and her hand slowly fades out of sight. Arthur watches her disappear in front of him... leaving Arthur Kriticos completely alone. A beat passes... then Arthur looks up and sees -- Kathy and Bobby rising out of the center island of the Ocularis in the great hall. Tied back to back they are helpless. OFF Arthur's reaction, we...
89) 6) dialog: Just don't move. Arthur approaches the outer ring, just as a THIRD INNER RING FLAPS UP, spinning in yet another direction, creating the combination of a meat grinder and a mixer. The Ocularis is working its way closer to the kids -- The kids slouch down.
90) 0) text: Arthur notices Cyrus's ghost standing at the end of the corridor, a spectator to the deadly game. He's taken aback by the old man's presence, finally recognizing him.
90) 1) dialog: Cyrus...? (losing it) Damn you for building this place! Cyrus doesn't respond.
90) 2) dialog: Do something! Help me save the kids! The ghost raises his hand, pointing into the Ocularis, motioning for Arthur to jump in... and that will stop everything. A FOURTH INNER RING FLAPS UP, working its way closer to the center. The kids are freaking out. Arthur looks from his kids, to the spinning rings, and back to Cyrus again. He wrestles with what he should do... Then his eyes land on Jean. She looks so sad, staring at her hysterical kids, helpless. Arthur's choice is made. He steps up to the Ocularis, standing in front of the spinning gears. He prepares himself for what he's about to do.
91) 0) text: Arthur starts forward into the hall, ready to take his place amongst the ghosts.
91) 1) dialog: (to kids) I want you guys to know... I love you both more than anything. The kids realize what he's doing.
91) 6) dialog: It's the only way. I'm sorry. Take care of each other... Arthur takes a long look around at the macabre scene before him. First, to the ghosts that circle the Eye, each still trapped in his or her own hell. Then Arthur focuses on the blades that swirl around him, threatening to dice his family, all that he loves. Then Arthur looks down into the fiery mechanical purgatory that is the Eye of Hell, its gigantic GEARS GRINDING away, the steel bathed in crimson light, driving the house/machine toward its fantastic culmination. Finally to the symbols on the outer ring that flash by at Arthur's feet. The whole effect does something to Arthur. Especially the mesmerizing symbols flying by. We suddenly INTERCUT WITH:
91) 19) dialog: Twelve. Arthur flashes back to the library one final time. This time it's Rafkin doing the talking.
91) 21) dialog: If I'm the thirteenth...

92) 6) dialog: You took away everything I loved, you monster. Everything! (with every blow) Now. I. Want. It. Back! But Arthur has never been a warrior. Cyrus, spotting his opportunity, retaliates. Cyrus connects with Arthur in the face, knocking him down. Then he kicks Arthur in the gut a few times, making sure he stays down.
93) 0) text: Arthur regains himself... when Cyrus appears over him.
93) 2) dialog: You sonofabitch! Arthur rises to attack, but Cyrus stops him with a steel sword he pulls from his cane. He points the blade beneath Arthur's chin. Arthur's eyes dart around, searching for a last way out. Cyrus spots Arthur thinking...
94) 5) dialog: (to his kids) Don't look...
96) 0) text: The GREAT GLASS GROANS DEEPLY as the torquing of the clockworks causes sheets of glass to fall from their frames. Two more rings have FLIPPED UP, the blades getting closer to the center of the Ocularis and the kids. GLASS begins to BREAK UP all around Arthur. Shards of glass rain down. He knows he hasn't much time. Kathy holds Bobby close, protecting him.
96) 2) dialog: Just hang on! I'm coming! Arthur backs up, and takes a running jump through the spinning blades, just barely landing on the center island of the Ocularis, with Kathy and Bobby. (CONTINUED )

99) 0) text: The HOUSE starts to BLOW APART. Glass rains down. Arthur holds his kids tight. The HOUSE is CRUMBLING all around them. The only place that's safe is where the three of them are standing. The FURY builds to a CRESCENDO of destruction, and then finally COLLAPSES! Followed by silence... Dust and smoke everywhere, blurring our vision. As it begins to dissipate, three figures slowly come INTO FRAME. Arthur, Kathy and Bobby are standing on the only remaining section of the house left... the center island of the Ocularis. All around them lies what's left of the house. A veritable skeleton of steel. The three of them open their eyes to survey the destruction.
99) 1) dialog: You guys okay? (CONTINUED )
99) 5) dialog: I didn't. I just wasn't about to leave you guys. Kathy pulls her father into a tight hug, she's teary- eyed.
99) 7) dialog: I love you, too. As they look up, they notice Jean, standing on the outer ring, circling around them. She's back to looking like her old healthy self, and she's smiling at her family. As she passes around them again... she's gone. Arthur pulls his kids close, and that's when they hear --
