15) 0) text: Arthur comes out of the bathroom and beholds, in the kitchenette of his small, cramped three-bedroom apartment... A blur of activity: Kathy cooks at the stove, his son BOBBY, 7, eats a bowl of cereal at the kitchen table, while scanning the obituary section of the newspaper. He records the different, humorous deaths with a microphone and a tape recorder. In the b.g., on the TELEVISION, a black and white horror movie drones on (the original Thirteen Ghosts). The nanny, MAGGIE, 26, just gets in the way... wiping the counter, pouring the OJ, setting the table. It's a very disorganized way of doing things. She's trying, sort of, but we can see from Kathy's body language that she's at her wits' end with the woman.
15) 16) dialog: Bobby, don't call your sister a slut.
15) 18) dialog: A term like 'bitch' would be more appropriate. ‘Slut' is a term reserved for those of loose sexual morals, something, to be perfectly frank, Kathy could use a bit more of.
15) 20) dialog: Well, it's true, girl. When's the last time you had a date? Arthur pretends to not be disturbed by the conversation around him, smiling and nodding.
16) 6) dialog: (to Bobby) Isn't this exciting? You have a late uncle!
16) 32) dialog: I'm not his wife. Kathy rolls her eyes.
19) 0) text: Arthur drives with Kathy beside him. Bobby and Maggie are in the back seat, playing hangman. His microphone's lying on the seat beside him.
19) 1) dialog: C'mon... you're taking too long.
27) 1) dialog: I did mention I don't do windows, didn't I? The walls of the entryway are lined with rare ancient documents in exquisite cases, archeological treasures, recognizably priceless antiques. The group looks around, amazed. With fascination, Arthur studies the text on the walls.
41) 0) text: Kathy, Bobby and Maggie are walking around, examining everything... still excited, oblivious to what's going on downstairs. (CONTINUED )
41) 6) dialog: I really don't think you should be riding that in -- And suddenly Maggie breaks out into a sprint. Bobby quickly jumps on his scooter, but he's too far behind to catch up.
41) 9) dialog: Gotta be on your toes, kid. Maggie walks into one of the rooms. Bobby follows her.
42) 4) dialog: So, do I look cool?
42) 6) dialog: (looking through glasses) My God... this is... incredible...
42) 10) dialog: One second.
42) 12) dialog: Alright, alright... here... Bobby puts them on, and reacts.
42) 20) dialog: Whoa... what's going on.
44) 13) dialog: He was with me. They turn to see Maggie walking up to them.

50) 22) dialog: Excuse me... did you say hunted?
50) 24) dialog: This basement?
50) 27) dialog: I gave Bobby a pair of those. This gets Arthur's attention. Maggie walks over and takes them out of Rafkin's hand. Slips them on.
50) 28) dialog: (looking around) I don't see any ghosts... (CONTINUED )
50) 32) dialog: «+. just more of that crazy Latin shit all over the floor. Rafkin takes the glasses back. Looks down. Impressed.
50) 34) dialog: Protection? You mean like oregano is to a vampire?
56) 0) text: Which is exactly what Rafkin didn't want to hear... especially in the basement. Maggie doesn't look too worried about things. Taking things rather nonchalantly, while Rafkin appears the frightened rabbit.
56) 2) dialog: I thought we've been over this. I can't see any ghosts.
56) 4) dialog: Where? Maggie looks around intently, but comes back confused. Rafkin looks at her, wondering. He pulls the glasses off her face and puts them on his own. He's shocked. The first two cubes are empty. (CONTINUED )
56) 10) dialog: Oh my God... it's a... it's a...
56) 12) dialog: What's he doing?
56) 17) dialog: Okay, I wanna go now... Maggie swallows hard. Rafkin, half smiling, gestures down the corridor, and reluctantly, she follows. At the last moment, Rafkin turns and flips the hammer the bird. But the ghost is gone...
61) 0) text: Rafkin and Maggie pass another empty cube. The symbol on the open door gets Rafkin's attention.
63) 0) text: The duo weave their way through the basement's maze of glass trying to locate Arthur and Kathy. Rafkin pulls Maggie along, trying to find the way out, but it's no use. The hallways all look the same. Pulling her around a corner, they find themselves trapped. A glass barrier cuts them off from the rest of the corridor.
63) 2) dialog: What? What!?
63) 6) dialog: (whispering) Why?
63) 8) dialog: It's gone... Rafkin takes the glasses back. Looks --
65) 0) text: Rafkin and Maggie continue down the dark corridor. A figure moves in and out of shadows following them. Rafkin notices the lurking ghost with the glasses.
65) 5) dialog: See what? I don't have glasses, you moron. Rafkin backs down the hall, Maggie behind him. He catches a quick glimpse of the first figure again. This time it's closer. He re-checks the other corridor, and the Suicide is there
65) 6) dialog: (nervous ) What is it?
68) 0) text: Rafkin and Maggie rush forward. Maggie's on edge, her eyes darting around, checking all the dark corners of the corridors. The HOUSE suddenly begins to MOVE again. At the end of the HALLWAY a door opens, while walls around them start t CLOSE IN and crush them.
69) 2) dialog: That idea ain't gonna work, you gotta plan B? She looks back THROUGH the glass for Rafkin, and spots -- The Hammer is standing right behind him, smiling. Rafkin reacts to Maggie's panicked look.
69) 4) dialog: Move! Rafkin jumps over as the Hammer swings. The Hammer strikes the floor where Rafkin just was. Sparks fly. Rafkin nervously looks at Maggie.
69) 8) dialog: Back!! Rafkin hops back, like a little frog, just as the Hammer reappears and swings, missing Rafkin and hitting an invisible wall. More sparks fly. Rafkin's sweating profusely now. He doesn't move. He's standing on the spells. One wrong step and he's dead. He glances around knowing the Hammer's presence is very close by. (CONTINUED )
69) 12) dialog: Oh, crap. Rafkin looks at her hopefully. Maggie nods.
69) 13) dialog: Okay. Right foot. Step right.
69) 16) dialog: Left foot.
69) 18) dialog: Right.
69) 20) dialog: Left foot. Forward.
69) 24) dialog: Another right. Rafkin goes to take a step with his right foot, and walk right off the spells. Maggie's not watching, she's more concerned with the Suicide heading in her direction. Maggie turns back just in time and sees the Hammer right in front of Rafkin --
69) 25) dialog: Shit! Just jump! Rafkin takes a flying leap towards the door. He makes it out safely, and rushes over to Maggie. Gives her a big "thank you" kiss on the lips.
69) 27) dialog: Fine. Just get me outta here.
70) 1) dialog: See anything?
73) 0) text: Rafkin and Maggie have backed themselves into a corner. Rafkin's looking at two figures, the Fat Man and the Little Woman, making their way down the corridors to them.
73) 1) dialog: (panicked) Just tell me when I'm supposed to scream, because I ain't gonna die without screaming my goddamn head off! Rafkin's looking at the two ghosts, the Fat Man and Little Woman, through the glasses. They quickly slip back into the darkness. He notices the pilgrims on the other end of the corridor. They're being cornered.
76) 47) dialog: The Eye of Hell?
76) 49) dialog: I saw a man carrying his own head. The Eye of Hell isn't a stretch.
76) 65) dialog: Isn't there any other way? (CONTINUED )
76) 96) dialog: Arthur! That's crazy!! Those things out there will kill you!
78) 0) text: After flashing a flare before them, Kalina and Maggie drop through the ceiling, back into the basement. They make their way through the glass hallway, coming to a door. As Kalina approaches it, she stumbled across Ben's sliced corpse. Maggie gasps at the remains.
78) 1) dialog: Oh... God... Looks like we found the lawyer.
79) 3) dialog: Hurry up!
79) 5) dialog: Damn... Kalina... you better get over here... this shit ain't workin' anymore! Maggie's panicking... and then her flare starts to go out.
79) 6) dialog: Hurry your ass up! Maggie backs up... and she's hit over the head from behind. She lands on the floor and goes out like a light. Cyrus's ghost approaches the body. And so does Kalina... The faint flare illuminates both of them. In Kalina's hand, we see the Arcanum. It's obvious she just struck Maggie with it. Kalina removes her glasses, and looks over at Cyrus's ghost. He's still there, hasn't vanished. They embrace and kiss. And then the flare completely goes out, plunging the room into darkness, and we... CuT TO: 76 THIRTEEN GHOSTS - Rev. 10/27/00 85A.
88) 0) text: Cyrus steps over Maggie's body, heads to the door.
92) 12) dialog: (reacting to Kalina) Jesus... (rubbing her head) Man, what is that noise?! Then she notices the reel-to-reel machine on the table. Maggie reaches the machine and looks for an off switch. Can't find one. The CHANTING sound is unbearable. She finally shoves the MACHINE off the table, and it goes CRASHING to the floor.
95) 0) text: Maggie stands before the mad machine as it whirls out of control.
95) 1) dialog: Oh, sweet Lord. What did I do? Maggie backs toward the door. The clockworks are breaking apart all around her. She tries the handle. It's locked.
95) 2) dialog: Mutherfucka...! The clockworks begin flying apart. Gears and bits of machinery start bursting through the glass walls of the clockworks room.
97) 0) text: As Maggie's eyes go wide.
99) 8) dialog: That's it! They all turn to see Maggie crawling out of the basement stairwell. She's a mess, she turns to Arthur and the kids --
99) 9) dialog: I'm through with this nanny shit. This was not in the job description. I'm sorry, you guys, but I quit... I quit. This puts a smile on Arthur, Kathy and Bobby's faces, as we... FADE OUT.
