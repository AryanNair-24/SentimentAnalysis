14) 0) text: A bright, sunny day... THROUGH a glass window we see and hear two children out playing in the yard. A Norman Rockwell, picture-perfect setting... A young boy and a teenage girl romp in the grass, then up to the window steps a beautiful woman, fresh from the garden. It's obvious she's the mother of these two. Over the giggling of the kids she smiles at ARTHUR KRITICOS, 50, sitting inside his bedroom, in a very comfortable chair, taking in his family with pride. We PAN TO Arthur as he smiles, content... A sharp KNOCK on the bedroom door breaks the mood, and Arthur turns. Our UNCUT CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO the door. As it does, it SWEEPS ACROSS a desk decorated with family photos, one of which is the woman at the window. CAMERA CONTINUES TO the door, where we notice the wall and door around KATHY, Arthur's 21-year-old daughter, has somehow aged from the pristine room we thought we were in. Kathy sticks her head in. Pretty if she ever had time to fix her hair, clad in a University of Calumny sweatshirt. She stirs a pan of burnt scrambled eggs.
14) 1) dialog: Dad... it's almost eight-thirty... shake a leg. You'll miss your first class. And could you tell Maggie to get the hell out of the bathroom. She had her five minutes twenty minutes ago. (CONTINUED )
15) 0) text: Arthur comes out of the bathroom and beholds, in the kitchenette of his small, cramped three-bedroom apartment... A blur of activity: Kathy cooks at the stove, his son BOBBY, 7, eats a bowl of cereal at the kitchen table, while scanning the obituary section of the newspaper. He records the different, humorous deaths with a microphone and a tape recorder. In the b.g., on the TELEVISION, a black and white horror movie drones on (the original Thirteen Ghosts). The nanny, MAGGIE, 26, just gets in the way... wiping the counter, pouring the OJ, setting the table. It's a very disorganized way of doing things. She's trying, sort of, but we can see from Kathy's body language that she's at her wits' end with the woman.
15) 4) dialog: Bobby. Find a healthier hobby. Bobby shuts off the tape recorder, angry at the interruption.
15) 10) dialog: (also sotto) Have you tasted her cooking? Kathy makes a gagging response while scooping eggs onto the first of three places on the counter. He looks at the eggs burned in effigy but continues smiling.
15) 17) dialog: Thank you, Maggie.
15) 19) dialog: Ha. Ha.
15) 21) dialog: Why are you smiling?
15) 28) dialog: (to herself) If we had a bigger place we wouldn't have this problem!--
15) 31) dialog: What lawyer? (beat) I thought our credit was all cleaned up?
16) 2) dialog: I didn't know you have an Uncle Cyrus.
16) 4) dialog: We have a family fortune?
16) 8) dialog: His next birthday.
16) 10) dialog: Now we get his attention.
16) 17) dialog: A key?
16) 20) dialog: Bathrooms. Look, every bedroom has a bathroom!
16) 28) dialog: When can we see it?
16) 30) dialog: (to Arthur) Can we go tonight?
16) 35) dialog: Bobby...
16) 41) dialog: Great, we can stay the night, and come back in the morning.
19) 0) text: Arthur drives with Kathy beside him. Bobby and Maggie are in the back seat, playing hangman. His microphone's lying on the seat beside him.
19) 3) dialog: Come on, you guys, we're almost there. Arthur can tell his daughter's anxious.
19) 5) dialog: Yeah, Mom would've freaked over this.
19) 12) dialog: Dad. I've been thinking...
19) 14) dialog: Maybe I shouldn't, you know, go back. I could skip a year, be with you guys --
19) 16) dialog: I know, I just don't know what you guys are gonna do without me. Kathy's face flushes with emotion.
20) 2) dialog: Yeah, but that's not the point. It's just that... every smile you have is --
20) 4) dialog: It's... not real, Dad. Arthur's affected by her words.
20) 5) dialog: I loved her too. But sooner or later you've got to stop blaming yourself.
21) 0) text: Bobby looks through the front window, between Kathy and his dad.
21) 2) dialog: Dad, it's beautiful.
23) 15) dialog: Yeah... we're movin' in.
24) 4) dialog: That's... odd.
26) 3) dialog: I hope the bathroom's in the basement. Arthur pushes the door open, and they enter...
27) 3) dialog: Dad, this stuff must be worth a fortune.
27) 18) dialog: Dad --
27) 21) dialog: Dad... you're being paranoid and overprotective.
41) 0) text: Kathy, Bobby and Maggie are walking around, examining everything... still excited, oblivious to what's going on downstairs. (CONTINUED )
41) 3) dialog: I'll be in here. Bobby and Maggie continue on. Bobby turns on his microphone.
43) 0) text: Kathy walks in, but not before she notices that, from the hallway, the room appears to be empty. The glass door, we now realize, is "trick" glass.
43) 1) dialog: This place is awesome. Kathy walks over to the bed. Plops down, sinking into all the silk. Her half-closed eyes tell us -- puurrfect. (CONTINUED )
43) 4) dialog: No way... She slips off the bed, opening the door, revealing her new bathroom. And if ever a room could be carved from a single diamond, this is it.
43) 5) dialog: Now that's what I'm talkin' about! 44 43.
44) 0) text: It's spectacular. Immaculate. And not only spacious, but appointed. The shelves are stacked with jewel-like bottles of perfume. Kathy's wet dream. As we VIEW her FROM BENEATH the glass shelves, she begins inspecting her own found treasure. Everything seems to be unashamedly brand-new.
44) 1) dialog: We've struck gold.
44) 5) dialog: It doesn't get any better than this. (CONTINUED )
44) 10) dialog: Yeah, but --
44) 12) dialog: With Maggie...
44) 20) dialog: But --
44) 22) dialog: Why are you freaking out?
45) 1) dialog: What happened to the door?
45) 7) dialog: There must be another way out.
50) 0) text: Arthur, Kathy, Maggie and Rafkin are searching the house, looking for Bobby. (CONTINUED )
50) 5) dialog: Robert!! Stop screwing around!
50) 9) dialog: So what do these do?
50) 12) dialog: Let's go back for a second to the ecto-thing...
50) 14) dialog: Poltergeists? (CONTINUED )
50) 20) dialog: Hey!
55) 0) text: Behind Kathy and Arthur, and elsewhere near Rafkin and Kalina three more doors slide open, unnoticed. CuT TO:
58) 0) text: Arthur hurries forward. Kathy behind him.
58) 1) dialog: Dad, slow down...
58) 3) dialog: We're gonna get lost... And on that note, Arthur turns the corner, and finds Bobby's microphone and glasses lying in the middle of the corridor floor. He stops in his tracks. Kathy notices them too. Both of them fear the worst. They slowly walk over to the items. Arthur picks up Bobby's microphone, while Kathy grabs his glasses. Arthur presses PLAY on the RECORDER -- Bobby's last words bellow out.
59) 0) text: ON Bobby's side of the wall, Bobby pounds on the glass as he sees Arthur comfort Kathy with a hug.
62) 0) text: Kathy holds up the glasses to her father.
62) 1) dialog: Dad, Bobby was wearing these. Maybe Rafkin was right. Maybe there really are --
62) 8) text: At the end of the corridor, Kathy is seen being dragged invisibly across the floor, pinned to the wall, then dragged up it to the ceiling.
62) 9) dialog: Daddy! Help me!! Oh God!! Her clothes are shredded from her body.
62) 12) dialog: Daddy, help me! Arthur, without glasses, can't see the Jackal, but he can see the impossible spectacle of an invisible something savagely tearing his daughter apart.
62) 14) dialog: Make it let go! Make it let go!
62) 26) dialog: Hurry, Daddy!! At the last possible moment, the Jackal leaps. Kathy screams again. The Jackal suddenly slams into an invisible barrier. Kathy reacts with astonishment as the ghost rips and tears into the barrier like a wild animal trying to get at meat... sparks fly. The trio tries to regain themselves around the corner. Kathy's in Arthur's arms, cut, bruised, crying. He looks up with fire in his eyes at Kalina --
63) 0) text: The duo weave their way through the basement's maze of glass trying to locate Arthur and Kathy. Rafkin pulls Maggie along, trying to find the way out, but it's no use. The hallways all look the same. Pulling her around a corner, they find themselves trapped. A glass barrier cuts them off from the rest of the corridor.
64) 7) dialog: (nervously) Dad... it's still there... (CONTINUED )
71) 0) text: Kathy comes suddenly awake, rubbing her head. Focusing!--
71) 1) dialog: Wha-what happ -- ? She looks around the room. Bobby's sitting beside her. Dried tear streaks run down his face.
71) 3) dialog: Bobby... oh, my God... are you alright? We've been looking all over for you.
71) 5) dialog: It's gonna be okay.
71) 7) dialog: (looks around) Where are we? What part of the house?
71) 9) dialog: What do you mean? Here?
71) 14) dialog: I'm not sure what to believe... Kathy holds her brother close while they wait.
71) 16) dialog: Yeah?
71) 18) dialog: I know, kiddo, so do I. We're gonna get out of here soon. I'm sure Dad's on his way right now. OFF her hopeful look, we... CuT TO:
87) 0) text: Arthur has his hand on the glass. Jean's about to put her hand against his, when the CHANTING sound hits her... and her hand slowly fades out of sight. Arthur watches her disappear in front of him... leaving Arthur Kriticos completely alone. A beat passes... then Arthur looks up and sees -- Kathy and Bobby rising out of the center island of the Ocularis in the great hall. Tied back to back they are helpless. OFF Arthur's reaction, we...
89) 0) text: The CHANTING is ECHOING through the house. The Ocularis has begun to spin with Kathy and Bobby still seated in the center. One of the OUTER RINGS is slowly circling around them, when it suddenly LIFTS UP, swirling around them like a blade.
89) 2) dialog: Don't look!
89) 5) dialog: Daddy... get us out of here...
91) 2) dialog: Dad! Don't!
96) 0) text: The GREAT GLASS GROANS DEEPLY as the torquing of the clockworks causes sheets of glass to fall from their frames. Two more rings have FLIPPED UP, the blades getting closer to the center of the Ocularis and the kids. GLASS begins to BREAK UP all around Arthur. Shards of glass rain down. He knows he hasn't much time. Kathy holds Bobby close, protecting him.
99) 0) text: The HOUSE starts to BLOW APART. Glass rains down. Arthur holds his kids tight. The HOUSE is CRUMBLING all around them. The only place that's safe is where the three of them are standing. The FURY builds to a CRESCENDO of destruction, and then finally COLLAPSES! Followed by silence... Dust and smoke everywhere, blurring our vision. As it begins to dissipate, three figures slowly come INTO FRAME. Arthur, Kathy and Bobby are standing on the only remaining section of the house left... the center island of the Ocularis. All around them lies what's left of the house. A veritable skeleton of steel. The three of them open their eyes to survey the destruction.
99) 4) dialog: How did you know we'd be safe here?
99) 6) dialog: I love you, Dad.
