0) 180) dialog: In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe.  My art has been commended as being  strongly vaginal.  Which bothers  some men.  The word itself makes  some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
0) 182) dialog: Yes, they don't like hearing it and  find it difficult to say.  Whereas  without batting an eye a man will  refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or  his "Johnson".
0) 184) dialog: Thank you. This to Elfranco, who has handed her a robe. All right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases.  My fat told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to giv Now.  As for this. . . "kidnapping"--
0) 186) dialog: Yes, I know about it.  And I know  that you acted as courier.  And let  me tell you something:  the whole  thing stinks to high heaven.
0) 188) dialog: Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
0) 190) dialog: Sex.  The physical act of love.   Coitus.  Do you like it?
0) 192) dialog: You're not interested in sex?
0) 194) dialog: I like it too.  It's a male myth  about feminists that we hate sex.   It can be a natural, zesty enterprise.  But unfortunately there are some  people--it is called satyriasis in  men, nymphomania in women--who engage  in it compulsively and without joy.
0) 196) dialog: Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate  souls cannot love in the true sense  of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance  Bunny is one of these.
0) 198) dialog: Take a look at this, sir. She is aiming a remote at a projection TV.  The screen  flickers to life.  A title card:
0) 209) dialog: And you recognize her, of course. The girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski. Bunny The TV is in here.
0) 211) dialog: (grimly)
0) 214) dialog: Lord.  You can imagine where it goes  from here.
0) 216) dialog: Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little  matter to me that this woman chose  to pursue a career in pornography, nor that she has been "banging" Jackie  Treehorn, to use the parlance of our times.  However.  I one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other being my father.  The Foundation takes youngsters from Wa and--
0) 218) dialog: Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,  yes, and proud we are of all of them.   I asked my father about his withdrawal  of a million dollars from the  Foundation account and he told me  about this "abduction", but I tell  you it is preposterous.  This  compulsive fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride.
0) 220) dialog: I'm getting to your rug. My  father  and I don't get along; he doesn't  approve of my lifestyle and, needless  to say, I don't approve of his.   Still, I hardly wish to make my  father's embezzlement a police matter,  so I'm proposing that you try to  recover the money from the people  you delivered it to.
0) 222) dialog: If you successfully do so, I will  compensate you to the tune of 1% of  the recovered sum.
0) 224) dialog: Thousand, yes, bones or clams or  whatever you call them.
0) 226) dialog: --your rug, yes, well with that money  you can buy any number of rugs that  don't have sentimental value for me.   And I am sorry about that crack on  the jaw. The Dude fingers his jaw, where the lump from the sap has all but disappeared.
0) 228) dialog: Here's the name and number of a doctor  who will look at it for you.  You  will receive no bill.  He's a good  man, and thorough.
0) 230) dialog: Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a  good man, and thorough.
0) 399) dialog: Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the  doctor.
0) 401) dialog: Do you have any news regarding my  father's money?
0) 403) dialog: She most certainly was not!
0) 405) dialog: And please don't call her my mother.
0) 407) dialog: She is most definitely the perpetrator  and not the victim.
0) 409) dialog: From who?
0) 411) dialog: Dieter Hauff?
0) 413) dialog: Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
0) 415) dialog: Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for  about twenty years.  Look at my LP's.   Under 'Autobahn.' The Dude fingers through the albums filling one bookshelf
0) 416) dialog: That was his group--they released  one album in the mid-seventies. The Dude stops between two albums.
0) 418) dialog: Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their  music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop. The Dude pulls out an album with a worn sleeve.  On it is the group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, an picture
0) 422) dialog: Is he pretending to be the abductor?
0) 424) dialog: Look, Jeffrey, you don't really   kidnap someone that you're acquainted  with.  You can't get away with it if  the hostage knows who you are.
0) 426) dialog: So Dieter has the money?
0) 428) dialog: Do you still have that doctor's  number?
0) 430) dialog: Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be  responsible for any delayed after- effects.
0) 432) dialog: I want you to see him immediately. She is picking up a telephone.
0) 433) dialog: I'll see if he's available.  He's a  good man, and thorough.
0) 628) dialog: Jeffrey.
0) 630) dialog: Love me. The Dude is stupefied.
0) 634) dialog: Tell me a little about yourself,  Jeffrey.
0) 637) dialog: Uh-huh.
0) 639) dialog: Mmnun. Click--the Dude turns on a bedside lamp.  He and Maude li next to each other in bed.
0) 641) dialog: Oh?
0) 643) dialog: Uh-huh.
0) 645) dialog: What do you do for fun?
0) 647) dialog: What happened to your house?
0) 649) dialog: Finder's fee?
0) 651) dialog: It's not my father's money, it's the  Foundation's.  Why did he think you  had it?  And who does?
0) 653) dialog: Jeffrey--
0) 655) dialog: I keep telling you, it's the  Foundation's money.  Father doesn't  have any.
0) 657) dialog: No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
0) 659) dialog: We did let Father run one of the  companies, briefly, but he didn't do  very well at it.
0) 661) dialog: He helps administer the charities  now, and I give him a reasonable  allowance.  He has no money of his  own.  I know how he likes to present  himself; Father's weakness is vanity.   Hence the slut.
0) 663) dialog: It increases the chances of  conception. The Dude spits some White Russian.
0) 665) dialog: Well yes, what did you think this  was all about?  Fun and games?
0) 667) dialog: I want a child.
0) 669) dialog: Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner.   In fact I don't want the father to  be someone I have to see socially,  or who'll have any interest in rearing  the child himself.
0) 672) dialog: Exactly.  What happened to your face?   Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well? The Dude is staring off into space, thinking.  His answer absent.
0) 674) dialog: What? The Dude is leaving the bedroom.
