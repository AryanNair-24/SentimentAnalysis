14) 1) text: Mini walks past the neon covered shop windows.
14) 3) dialog: I thought it would be a goof if I put a photo ad in one of those 25 cent "outcall" massage newspapers they sell around town. But I just got a bunch of pervs breathing heavy on my voice mail. So I went to an escort service, and when they found out I was 18, they told me they had two tricks in the same hotel that night...if I was up to it.
14) 6) dialog: Would you look at them?

24) 1) text: Mini is led in by a SECRETARY who presents Mini to one of PENINSULA BUSINESSMEN sitting behind a large oak desk.

28) 11) text: Mini's expression softens as she examines herself closer.
28) 13) dialog: Why not? I mean, he isn't my real dad...and talk about a first. The more I thought about it...

28) 20) dialog: (still in her southern accent) Just peachy. Listen, Sugar, would you mind turning the lights off, I'm kinda new to all this and a little shy.
28) 24) dialog: Sure can, in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

29) 19) dialog: You do know that's extra?
29) 22) dialog: Just so we're clear...Now, close your eyes.

30) 55) text: He looks back at Mini. He starts to lift a leg over the railing.
30) 57) dialog: Uh, that fall probably won't kill you, and considering what a caring nurturer your wife is, I don't think that's a risk you can afford to take.

33) 6) dialog: It took exactly one week.
34) 3) dialog: In the beginning, I was concerned this would violate my rule as he technically was a repeat customer, but then I realized this was my first affair, and with my stepfather no less. To be perfectly honest...I loved it. Talk about electric, knowing at any moment she could walk in was better than any drug. It reminded me of when I was young and brought guys home after school.

44) 5) dialog: So.
44) 9) dialog: Well, I don't think telling her is such a hot idea.
44) 25) dialog: You can't leave, she'll get half.
44) 28) dialog: Can I ask how the hell you married her without a pre-nup? Her?
44) 32) dialog: Well, there is another option.
44) 39) dialog: But it will take some planning... and some resolve.
44) 44) dialog: Kill her?
44) 47) dialog: No, of course not, she is my mother.
44) 57) dialog: But I've been thinking, if she suddenly got ill-
44) 61) dialog: Unstable, unpredictable, irrational...dangerous to the safety of her husband...her child...She would have to be sent someplace where they could give her the care she needs.

57) 13) text: Mini walks in, carrying the margarita.
57) 17) dialog: You're welcome.

65) 16) dialog: For the last three days she hasn't left the house.

73) 40) dialog: (eerily calm) I suppose we should call an ambulance?
73) 45) dialog: Do you really think they can save her?
73) 49) dialog: She'll only try it again. You know she will.
73) 64) dialog: Hold on, who are we to say her choice was wrong? She put those pills in her mouth.
73) 68) dialog: Don't "Mini" me, you've been bankrolling my little project from day one.
73) 72) dialog: I'd hardly call it murder, if anything, we're just helping to fulfill her last wish.
73) 76) dialog: So do people in comas. It's just a matter of time-
73) 80) dialog: Look, you can drop the indignant outrage, because if you really cared, you'd have already grabbed the phone and dialed 911 by now.

82) 28) dialog: Tell him to leave! This is outrageous!
82) 35) text: Mini looks at Martin, relieved.
82) 39) dialog: Didn't you hear him?! He said--
82) 126) text: Mini and Martin whisper together.

88) 27) dialog: Oh, come on, could that little moment between you and Jennifer have been any more awkward?
88) 30) dialog: I'm not jealous or anything, I just think it's funny. Talk about six degrees of penetration.

89) 1) text: Martin sits on a lounger, reading a book and looking very unhappy. From the pool, Mini emerges, soaking wet in a bikini.

130) 82) dialog: It was pretty clear Garson wasn't gonna give up, and sooner or later he'd find enough to charge us. It just seemed ridiculous that we'd both end up suffering.
130) 85) dialog: Oh, come on, you would've done it if you thought of it first...you know I'm right.
130) 94) dialog: (suddenly switching gears) Hey, listen, since conjugal visits are pretty much out of the question, I thought it would be cool if we tried a little prison phone sex.
130) 97) dialog: They don't tap these lines, do they? (looking around) I think I might even be able to open my blouse without anyone seeing...you ready?
130) 101) dialog: No? Are you sure? I won't be able to come back for a few weeks. (mock jealous) Wait, have you met someone in here?!
130) 105) dialog: Why, you old dog! I knew you wouldn't be single in here for long.
