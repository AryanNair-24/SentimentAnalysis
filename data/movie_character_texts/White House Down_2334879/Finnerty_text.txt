235) 2) dialog: We're going to need to swear you in, sir. It takes Raphelson a moment to realize she's looking at h 112.

250) 6) dialog: Yes. You have to go. Cale takes a breath.
250) 8) dialog: Then you have 12 minutes to figure out a way to get them out. Cale doesn't respond. He's staring across the hall at the painting of the White House in 1814...
254) 4) dialog: It's Cale.
257) 1) dialog: Something's happening in there! We have to give him more time!
