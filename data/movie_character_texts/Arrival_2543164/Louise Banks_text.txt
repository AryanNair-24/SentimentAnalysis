2) 1) dialog: It doesn’t work like I thought it did. We are so bound by time; by its order. She steps back inside, a little tipsy, smiling.
3) 1) dialog: Maybe there’s a higher order. Mingled here are also dinner plates. Candlelight.

CLOSE ON HER FACE: From outside looking in, a curious circular shadow is thrown from the deck light. But her ey start to water.

Hannah’s eyes roll up and she sighs her final breath. Louise’s grip on her daughter tightens. Trembling. A Nurse starts to pull Louise away, but she hangs on-- no it’s mother trying to return to her baby girl--

UNIVERSITY CAMPUS — DAY 10 Louise crosses campus. Absorbed in her thoughts. Overhead, a pair of F-22 fighters slice across the sky. EXT. STUDENT CENTER - MOMENTS LATER 1i Louise passes the campus center. A crowd of STUDENTS are huddled around the glass outside student center, looking in at a large TV. The crowd is to dense for Louise to see what is on the TV. Louise frowns, but keeps going. Overhead, a second pair of fighter jets rocket past. Louise looks up at the sky. Apprehensive. INT.

Louise looks b at the door, silently considering something, then decides LOUISE (CONT’D) Well, let’s get started. Today we're talking about Portuguese, and why it sounds so different from the other Romance languages. Louise walks to a MAP of western Europe on a rolling ease parked next to a TV.
8) 2) dialog: The story of Portuguese begins with the Kingdom of Galicia, in the middle ages, where the language was seen as an expression of art. The way it was written and spoken was rooted in aesthetics. One Grad Student’s phone CHIMES with an alert. Louise pau thinking what the other Students are thinking--

LOUISE (CONT’D) So in order for this to work, I might have to teach them English. The basics. Nouns, verbs. I can’t do that remotely. I have to be in the room with them. Weber and Louise stare down.

LOUISE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 25 Louise is asleep in her bed. Again with the formation of pillows around her. She wakes to a rhythmic thumping. Low; dull. Her hand goe her heart. It’s not her heart. From her bedroom window: A distant flying object vaguely a helicopter. One thing is clear: it’s on fast approach. As it gets closer, treetops bend and leaves scatter. INT. LOUISE’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 26 Dressed in a bathrobe, Louise crosses to the front window looking out on her wide, flat front yard. SPOTLIGHTS shine into her house, STROBES pop. We are so u to how a helicopter sounds, but this is different. The en noises, the rotors -- it’s more muscular; threatening. The lights finally dim to reveal: A Sikorsky UH-60 Blackh has touched down on the lawn. The passenger door is open, slid back to reveal someone riding in the rear compartmen Her doorbell rings. Louise answers it. Weber stands at the door, now in military uniform.

The wall be seen through, but it renders the other side milky and foggy-- it’s uncertain if the atmosphere on that side is sort of gas, or if the barrier just makes it seem so. The TECHS with Weber and Marks quickly set up an arsenal video, audio, and other recording equipment to face this glass-like partition. Chemical sniffers. IR and UV camera Barometers. And most disturbingly, an old-tech detection among the high-tech: A CANARY IN A CAGE. On the other side, the room seems empty. Louise and Ian are speechless. Their breathing is loud in their ears. Colonel Weber steps up to them.

LOUISE (CONT’D) Hello. The blurry shapes seem to undulate, but it’s unclear if t are moving or if there is some distortion in the partitio between their space and Louise’s. Louise gestures at them, looking for some possible gestur response: LOUISE (CONT’D) Hello. Can you hear me?

An inkblot coffee-cup stain with mesmerizing fractal embellishments. The taller, slimmer alien steps forward and says somethin Click-flutter-tone. Louise smiles. Nearly laughs. Wants to cry.

24) 23) dialog: It wasn’t until later that they learned “Kanguru” means “I don’t understand.” (re: whiteboard) I need this to make sure we don’t misinterpret in there. Otherwise this will take ten times as long. Time wasted is the key phrase to convince Weber.

29) 18) dialog: Okay, so this is where we want to get. Right? This question. (off Weber’s nod) To get there, we have to make sure they understand what a question is, and the nature of a request for information along with the response. Then there is clarifying the difference between a specific “you” from a collective “you.” We don’t want to know why Joe Alien is here, we want to know why all of them landed. 57 58 Blue Draft (05/06/2015) 42. She writes frantically over the words in columns, marking relations with arrows. As she speaks, her voice gets loud and more confident. This is her area of expertise. LOUISE (CONT’D) Purpose requires an understanding of intent. Which means we have to find out if they make conscious choices or if their motivation is so instinctive they don’t understand a “why” question, and biggest of all, we need to have enough of a vocabulary with them so we understand their answer. Colonel Weber nods and surrenders to her. Behind Weber, I grins devilishly at Louise, even winks at her.

Their skin is more mottled than a uniform color. Their to move slightly, not from breath but as a jellyfish. And th tips of one heptapod’s “feet” are dark with ink. Everyone holds their breath a beat. Slowly, Louise puts a hand on her heart and repeats: Green (07/09/2015) 44. LOUISE (CONT’D) My name is Louise. She takes the whiteboard and writes furiously.

It’s not quite the phrasing; she hasn’t taught them “why” instead uses “heptapods purpose Earth” with a curl on the logogram for Earth. Abbott stares a beat. And writes on the podium. As the logogram glows on the divider, Louise steps back i shock. She’s translated it already.

36) 31) dialog: Let’s fix that. Captain Marks checks the flatscreen monitors and tablet interfaces behind them -- one for Louise, one for Ian.
37) 0) text: The sentence on Louise’s flatscreen reads: “Ian gives Lou an apple because tomorrow she will be hungry.” On the monitor behind her: the library is FULL of logogra Abbott replies. The written logogram is displayed: A gorg interwoven circle of loops, whorls, and splotches.
37) 2) dialog: I think it’s what we wrote. (pointing) Look. This is the word for “apple” but it’s conjoined with their names... I can’t tell where it starts or ends.
37) 4) dialog: How do you begin to craft a complex statement like this? The relation each symbol has to another... (then) You know what? We’ve never seen them write. Only the result. Let’s see them in the act of writing. Louise returns to the tablet. Erases the sentence on her screen. And then, instead of preparing words and displayi the result, she triggers the “live sketching” option that shows her writing the letters and words in real-time. She writes the sentence: “Louise writes so heptapods can her writing.” Abbott and Costello crook their heads. Then Abbott approaches the transparent boundary, which becomes clearer than ever before. Captain Marks notices. Tenses.
37) 6) dialog: Oh my god. Nonlinear orthography. Ian catches up to what she’s saying.
37) 9) dialog: Imagine trying to write a long sentence with two hands, starting at either end. To do that, you'd have to know every single word you’re going to write, and the space all of it occupies. Ian struggles to find reference to her logogram.
37) 11) dialog: I asked about predictability. If “before” and “after” mean anything to them. Or if they don’t know what that means. Ian shuffles through notes on his tablet.
37) 15) dialog: Give weapon now? Abbott draws a simple logogram. The translation: “SOLVE” LOUISE (CONT’D) Solve what? Blue Draft (05/06/2015) 66. The transparent boundary clears itself of all its writing Abbott then draws two lines that meet in the middle to fo one long, contiguous line. Abbott gestures at the timeline and speaks: Click-click. LOUISE (CONT’D) That’s their spoken word for time.
37) 17) dialog: I remember how it sounds. Then, Abbott draws a logogram on the far end of the line. Louise translates: LOUISE (CONT’D) Humanity. That’s us.
37) 19) dialog: At the end of our timeline. The logogram from earlier forms again: “SOLVE.”

Muddled voices in Mandarin. Louise translates:

47) 6) dialog: Oh, so I should see things from your perspective, but did you ever see it from mine? Just once? (re: Timeline) You got the symbol for ‘humanity’ wrong. Doesn’t that say it all. She walks around to the other side of the screen and make adjustments by touch. Ian watches from Louise’s desk on the other side... and h nearly gasps in surprise. From his POV, the timeline is reversed. And the logogram means ‘humanity’ now looks the same from either side.

48) 5) dialog: It’s a complicated sentence. I’m trying to figure it out. Louise approaches the boundary, opposite Abbott. The wall becomes more and more transparent, revealing Abb more intimately than ever before. The alien gestures at her. Louise tentatively puts up two hands, then lowers one.
48) 7) dialog: I can’t. I can’t draw both ends at the same time. She holds her right hand up against the glass. It reacts forming ink on Abbott’s side. As she does, Abbott holds up one hand against the glass o his end, to the left of her position.
48) 11) dialog: He's being my other arm. He’s finishing my sentence. The two co-authors finish simultaneously, connecting the of their logograms into a circle. REVEAL an angle showing Abbott's hand perfectly aligned w Louise’s, only the transparent wall between them.

They appear with dozens of GEOMETRIC EQUATIONS. Circles. Angular shapes. Equations in heptapod with Arabic numeral around them like liner notes. A waterfall of data. It pou down the screen. PRESSING IN on Ian, who smiles broadly.
49) 5) dialog: Those are our names... (translating) Must leave? (to Abbott) You're asking us to go? She gets close now-- Ian approaches a DUFFEL BAG toppled by the glass barrier the floor, getting closer to the sound-~ Pulling it away to reveal: A_set of wired C4 CHARGES stuc against the glass--

50) 29) dialog: We have to.
50) 31) dialog: That’s the wrong move. As long as they stay, we have to stay. We have to keep talking. A low, STRANGE TONE reverberates through the tent. This one is not the tone they’ve heard before. And it’s accompanied by a RUMBLE. EXT. SCIENCE TENT — DAY 95 Louise, Ian and Weber emerge from the tent to see: 96 97 Yellow (06/11/2015) 90. The Shell lifts higher into the sky. It rises, vibrating everyone’s rib cages, the air beneath undulating as if reflected on water. Then, several hundred feet up... it stops. And hovers.

51) 33) dialog: (a-ha moment) Do you know what this means? INT. OPERATIONS TENT - “WAR ROOM” — DAY 100 Connected to the Operations tent, but made private, walle off from the screens and the noise. Mainly it’s just a conference table, some comms gear, and a world map. Louise, flanked by Ian, confronts Colonel Weber at the conference table with Agent Halpern. She holds up the printout.
51) 34) dialog: This is just one piece of it. What they're telling us, right here, is that ours is one of twelve. We’re part of a larger whole.
51) 36) dialog: (to Weber) Why do I have to talk to him?
51) 38) dialog: (to Halpern) We need to talk to the other sites and help them with whatever they've gotten from the other heptapods.
51) 40) dialog: This is telling us the pieces go together.

51) 55) dialog: I’m-- I’m sorry?
51) 57) dialog: Family. Weber is surprised and confused by this answer. They’re interrupted by Halpern, who steps up with:

55) 0) text: Louise can feel the acceleration in her stomach, and in t pitch of the low tone reverberating inside. She looks around for anything else in the chamber with he No windows. No views outside. Outside the walls of the chamber, another metallic ROAR. Followed by a distant HIGH PITCH. Louise waits for a portal to open. None do. She’s trapped inside this space.
55) 1) dialog: «.-Hello? At her feet, light sets the floor aglow. And then a luminous GAS seeps in and begins to rise aroun her. Filling the cylinder.
55) 2) dialog: Oh god-- oh god oh god-- Louise puts on the oxygen mask as the barrier rises up to shoulders, then her neck and finally up over her head-- UNDERNEATH, the world is bright and mostly clear, and yet Louise’s hair drifts up around her face as if she were underwater. Louise breathes through the mask. Looks aroun A portal opens up opposite her. Light shines on her face. INT. “THE SHELL” - CONTINUOUS 108 Louise steps out to a dimensionless sea of bright mist. Yellow (06/11/2015) 101. No walls or ceiling. She looks up to see what might be a heptapod drifting int the white void far above her. Her breath is shallow. She is in a truly alien place now. There is no reference for this experience. Something dark and enormous “swims” through the mist, pas by her, always just far enough to make it impossible to s clearly -- it could be a swarm of small things, or someth the size of a blue whale. And then a heptapod approaches from behind her. Louise sp around in time to see it as its seven limbs advance to he Beat. She finally controls her breathing.
55) 3) dialog: Costello? Costello stands with limbs poised before her... Then the mist clears a bit, revealing more of his heptapo body. The limbs and torso? What seemed to be the entire f of the alien? Not so. It is more like the fingers and han a much larger being. Costello towers over her. She looks up, in awe. And then it writes on the invisible floor beneath them. W two fingers. Ink sluicing out from them into a logogram. SUBTITLES: “Louise.” Louise takes a breath. LOUISE (CONT’D) Where is Abbott? Costello moves the ink around with one appendage and a ne logogram forms. SUBTITLES: “Abbott is dead.” Louise holds her stomach, she’s hit so hard by this. LOUISE (CONT’D) I’m sorry. We are sorry. The logogram ink shifts again. Louise looks down to read SUBTITLES: “Abbott chooses to save Louise and Ian.” Yellow (06/11/2015) 101A. Another ink-shift for a second logogram: SUBTITLES: “Louise has question?” Louise remembers her mission. Her reason for making the t LOUISE (CONT’D) I need... need you to send a message. To the other sites. Costello replies by modifying the first logogram. SUBTITLES: “Message here. Louise has weapon.” LOUISE (CONT’D) That’s just it, I-- (directly) What is your purpose here? Blue Draft (05/06/2015) 102. Costello stares down at her. Inky globules drift in from the mist, showering not rando but into patterns. Circles. A hundred logograms. A thousa Click-click, flutter-whisper-tone. SUBTITLES: “The story our people. A span of two point nine billion years.” Louise marvels at it. A chain of them light up at her feet, shifting for her to see. Louise reads it aloud:
55) 4) dialog: “Three thousand years from this point, humanity helps us. We help humanity now. Returning the favor.” (to Costello) You know both your past and your future... How? A podium screen rises between Louise and Costello. The timeline riddle appears. Up close, more details are visib It’s more artful than a simple line segment with a large bulbous flourish at one end. There are little stems and c along the line. And then that familiar logogram-- SUBTITLES: “Solve.” LOUISE (CONT’D) Did we answer wrong? A NEW SERIES OF SYMBOLS: “Many answers given. Many become one. Only one matters.” The message the Russian Scientist translated, in part. Lo looks back at the timeline.
55) 5) dialog: But I don’t understand, it’s time-- (then) Time. Wait. Is it? What's the logogram for time... Louise is seized with a realization. She reaches out and touches the timeline on the screen. Nudges it. It moves. From both ends, she wraps the line into its own circle... exact representation of the logogram. It pulses when she completes the action.

Costello turns to her, some of his arms float in the air the strands of Louise’s hair. Despite his unearthly figur he seems to look upon her with tenderness. A final logogr forms on the floor between them: SUBTITLES: “You already have. You choose life.” The THRUM increases in urgency. That same cylinder rises around her feet to encase her once again.

The ovoid craft reverses its hemispheres until finally it sitting upside-down from its previous position. Louise emerges from behind the hill, running toward us. H hair is damp from the exposure to the alien atmosphere. Three pickup trucks rush toward her. SIX MEN in full HAZM suits grab LOUISE, as the spaceship starts to leave the ground with an ASTONISHING SOUND. Ian is among the men. He calls her name but it’s drowned by the sound of the ship overhead. The spaceship then disappears in the clouds.
