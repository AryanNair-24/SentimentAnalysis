11) 6) dialog: Two days and already the public expects us to know the answers. Louise turns to see the source of the voice at her office door. COLONEL WEBER (50s) wears civilian clothing but his body language screams career military. Callused hands, sh eyes, rigid posture. Yellow (06/11/2015) 10A. He steps in and reaches to her computer, powering off the speakers. Behind him, two large MEN stand guard in the ha
11) 8) dialog: I’m Colonel G.T. Weber. You and I never formally met but two years ago you did some Farsi translation for Army Intelligence.
11) 10) dialog: Alan works for me. You made quick work of those insurgent videos. Louise crosses her arms. He’s touched a nerve.
11) 12) dialog: You have another two years on your SSBI so you still have top secret clearance. That's why I’m in your office, and not at Berkeley.
11) 14) dialog: I need you to translate something for me. As one of the men guarding the door shuts it, giving them total privacy, Colonel Weber places a pocket-sized digita recorder on Louise’s desk. He hits PLAY. White noise, shuffling. Then murmured talk, and: MAN’S VOICE (on recorder) Why are you here? In response: A SERIES OF SOUNDS that have no Earthly comparison. An audio mixture of organic clicks, rushing water, whispers, and low-octave moaning. MAN’S VOICE (CONT’D) (on recorder) Can you understand us? 12. Almost immediately, the SOUNDS return, this time slightly different. The bass tone is lower. The whispers raspy. Louise listens, rapt. As if she’s waking up from a long sleep. She leans in. Weber studies her face while she listens. MAN’S VOICE (CONT’D) (on recorder) Where did you come from? Before an answer is heard, Weber stops playback and takes back the recorder.
11) 15) dialog: Well? What do you make of it?
11) 17) dialog: Yes. The weight of his answer settles on Louise. Beat.
11) 19) dialog: How many what?
11) 21) dialog: Two. Assume they were not speaking at the same time.
11) 23) dialog: Keep your focus on the sounds. Weber replays a portion of the recording. The alien VOICE sounds even stranger a second time. COLONEL WEBER (CONT’D) What would be your approach to translating this? Does any of it sound like words to you? Phrases? Pink (05/18/2015) 13.
11) 25) dialog: (said not as a question) What can you tell me.
11) 27) dialog: You didn’t need that for the Farsi translations.
11) 29) dialog: I know what you’re doing.
11) 31) dialog: I’m not taking you to Montana. It’s all I can do to keep it from becoming a tourist site for anyone with TS clearance.
11) 33) dialog: We will set up a safe room at a facility here in town where you can observe video of the conversations in real-time. I’1l put you on the line with our team at the site.
11) 35) dialog: (beat) What do you mean, ‘no’?
11) 37) dialog: You’1l make it work. Her patience wears thin.
11) 39) dialog: No.
11) 41) dialog: There is one opportunity here, and that is to study them remotely. If I leave here, your chance is gone. Weber turns to leave.
11) 43) dialog: Maybe, why?
11) 45) dialog: Good morning.
11) 47) dialog: Gavisti.
11) 49) dialog: He said it means an argument. What does it really mean?
11) 52) dialog: Pack your bags. It hits Louise: She got the job. All right. Give me twenty minutes.
11) 53) dialog: You have ten. Louise glares at Weber for just a moment, then dashes off her bedroom. EXT. LAKE HOUSE —- PRE-DAWN 27 Louise (now dressed and carrying an overnight bag) hurrie for the Blackhawk. The rotor blades flatten the grass on lawn and pull at Louise’s coat. Weber helps Louise inside and then shuts the door. The helicopter rises immediately.
12) 4) dialog: Louise, this is Ian Donnelly. Neither Louise nor Ian offer to shake hands. They study o another as they talk. Yellow (06/11/2015) 7.
12) 11) dialog: Ian is a theoretical physicist from Los Alamos. He is the man with the questions. You will be reporting to me but you’1ll be working with him when you’re in the shell.
12) 14) dialog: Priority one: What do they want, where are they from? Weber speaks them as orders. Ian thinks it’s a conversati
12) 18) dialog: This is why you’re both here. Ian nods as he puts his notebook up, but it’s clear he’s anxious to get past the small talk and on to the big idea
15) 1) dialog: Every thirteen hours a sort of door opens up, at the base. That’s where we go in.
15) 3) dialog: You're the only scientists going in. But you both have a team here-- 31 Yellow (06/11/2015) 19.
15) 5) dialog: Mostly NSA. Cryptanalysts, a couple of signal processing experts... A phone handset’s cradle lights up by Weber. He answers i
15) 7) dialog: We’ll need to hurry you through.
16) 0) text: Colonel Weber, Ian, and Louise are escorted out of the helicopter and into base camp. The camp is divided into t clusters of tents/buildings: OPERATIONS and SCIENCE. CAPTAIN MARKS (barely 30, disciplined; a man of rules) me Weber and updates him as they walk:
16) 2) dialog: Tell me.
16) 4) dialog: All right. Take these two to Kettler. 32 33 Yellow (06/11/2015) 20.
16) 6) dialog: (to Ian and Louise) You will follow this man to medical. The procedure should take just a few minutes. Louise and Ian keep up with the Captain’s brisk march. A Medevac helicopter powers up on a pad nearby. Someone i strapped to a gurney inside, flanked by two Paramedics. Ian notices. So does Louise. They exchange looks.
19) 14) dialog: Remember: We need answers as soon as possible. Why they are here. What they want, what they will give us. This is the priority. 35 36 Yellow (06/11/2015) 23.
19) 16) dialog: We can’t tell what they’re saying when they respond to “hello.” So don’t get ahead of yourselves. Louise frowns as a new question occurs to her.
20) 1) dialog: We're just getting started. Stepping back, Louise asks Weber:
20) 3) dialog: (beat) Honestly, they all prefer to stay out here. Suddenly, a low, deep bass TONE vibrates the tent. A pen falls off a desk. A TECH grabs his coffee mug. The tent-t CLATTER against the support poles. It’s terrifying. COLONEL WEBER (CONT’D) That’s our ten-minute warning. INT. “CLEAN ROOM” — DAY 36 A miniature Silkwood. Contained showers. Dressing areas.
21) 2) dialog: Yes. (beat) This is the easy part. Our job was recon. Now it’s your job. This does nothing to comfort Louise. Above: A distant, indiscernible light. Ian studies the surface of the tunnel as they ascend, mov his flashlight beam over it. In the light’s edge, it seem perfectly smooth, but in the full beam there’s a texture. The lift stops. One of the Techs cracks a GLOWSTICK and throws it straight up. Louise watches it arc up... then veer to one wall, bounce and then it settles AGAINST THE WALL. Without falling.
21) 6) dialog: All right. It’s okay. He holds onto her. Firm. Calm. Wise. And then he launches them both. Louise looks up, wide-eyed, fearful she’s breaking the la of physics, but tucked in next to Weber... They “swim” toward the others, leaving the lift behind... And then they come to rest on the wall/floor of the tunne Louise finds her footing. And her breath. And they walk.
22) 0) text: The chamber has no hard corners or edges. Vaguely rectangular. The room is bisected by a semi-transparent wall. The wall be seen through, but it renders the other side milky and foggy-- it’s uncertain if the atmosphere on that side is sort of gas, or if the barrier just makes it seem so. The TECHS with Weber and Marks quickly set up an arsenal video, audio, and other recording equipment to face this glass-like partition. Chemical sniffers. IR and UV camera Barometers. And most disturbingly, an old-tech detection among the high-tech: A CANARY IN A CAGE. On the other side, the room seems empty. Louise and Ian are speechless. Their breathing is loud in their ears. Colonel Weber steps up to them.
22) 2) dialog: They arrive.
22) 4) dialog: The suits? Yes.
22) 6) dialog: What are you getting at?
22) 10) dialog: You’re up, Doctor Banks. Louise tries to control her breathing. Shrouded in the mist beyond the glass, the aliens stare b
22) 15) dialog: Sometimes. (beat) What does it mean? Louise looks to Ian, terrified at her own answer:
22) 19) dialog: Doctor Banks... 40 INT. “CLEAN ROOM” — DAY 40 Louise takes off her suit’s mask and gulps in air. Her ey are red from nervous tears. She looks physically drained. She pulls off a glove and notices tremors in her hand. Ian strides in and begins shedding his suit. She watches Hears him softly laughing to himself.
22) 23) dialog: You did better than the last guy.
22) 25) dialog: Well, you got until 1900 hours to figure something out.
22) 27) dialog: You go back in. Weber stands up to peel out of his suit. STAYING ON Louise, looking like she just escaped a fire a was told to run back into it... EXT. MONTANA LANDING SITE - EVENING 4l The sun sinks behind the sphere, casting long shadows ove the encampment.
23) 7) dialog: How long has she been in there.
23) 9) dialog: Did you two get any bright ideas on how to talk to them this time?
24) 1) dialog: What’s that for?
24) 3) dialog: For what?
24) 5) dialog: Okay. (then) Where do you start? INT. INTERVIEW CHAMBER — EVENING 46 CLOSE ON the whiteboard. Louise has written the word “HUM in large block letters. She stands by the whiteboard, marker in her trembling han Ian is with her, along with the team of TECHS behind them THE VAGUE ALIEN FIGURES are back, on the other side. Quie Louise speaks, and points to the word as she does:
24) 10) dialog: I said talk to them, not teach them how to read. Do you understand what this could mean?
24) 12) dialog: Only now you’ve made it twice as hard, trying to learn how to speak and read. That takes longer.
24) 14) dialog: I’m not saying no, I’m asking why.
24) 16) dialog: Hey. Everything you do in there I have to explain to a room full of men whose first and last question is, ‘How can this be used against us?’ So give me something. Louise gestures at the whiteboard.
24) 18) dialog: What?
24) 22) dialog: What’s your point?
24) 24) dialog: All right. I can sell that for now. But submit your vocabulary before the next session. (beat) And remember what happened to the aborigines. A more advanced race nearly wiped them out. Weber walks off with Captain Marks. Ian steps up, watching them go. Grinning at Louise:
29) 7) dialog: Louise, Ian, this is Agent David Halpern with the CIA. Weber guides Louise and Tan away from the bank of monitor It’s clear he doesn’t like dealing with Halpern.
29) 8) dialog: We need to gain ground today. You have your vocabulary list for me?
29) 10) dialog: (examines her list) You're going to teach them your name? And Ian’s?
29) 12) dialog: These are all grade-school words. Eat. Walk. Tool. We need to get more specific.
29) 14) dialog: (beat) No.
29) 17) dialog: We have one question: What is their purpose here on Earth? It isn’t complicated. (softening) Help me understand. Louise goes to a larger whiteboard stationed nearby and writes the question “What is your purpose on Earth?”
29) 19) dialog: All right, all right, I get it. Stick to your list. Just-- Then: That low, bone-trembling BASS TONE echoing out from Shell, rattling the equipment. Weber scraps what he was going to say, opting instead for COLONEL WEBER (CONT’D) Good luck. INT. “CLEAN ROOM” — MORNING 57 Louise and Ian suit up again. Louise notices the tremors her hands have returned. INT. INTERVIEW CHAMBER — MORNING 58 Louise faces the semi-transparent wall, holding a dry-era marker in one hand. Ian stands near the whiteboard. Every is in full HAZMAT suits again. Weber isn’t here this time The heptapods watch Louise with a strange curiosity. Louise points at herself.
29) 26) dialog: You’re risking contamination.
30) 0) text: Colonel Weber, Agent Halpern, and Doctor Kettler step to of Kettler’s work tables in a private conference, as if t just arrived in a hurry.
30) 1) dialog: Tell me. Are they a contamination risk without the suits?
30) 3) dialog: Any other sites working like this?
30) 5) dialog: All right, no suits for those two. But watch them closely for any signs.
32) 5) dialog: When Ian is done with his math portion, include this word on today’s vocabulary. Louise frowns and hands it back.
32) 9) dialog: Yes. But I trust you to choose your demonstrations carefully. 60 EXT. “CLEAN ROOM” /YELLOW TUNNEL ~ DAY 60 Ian and Louise approach the pickup truck. Louise takes th moment to speak quietly at Ian, through her teeth:
32) 15) dialog: (through speakers) Let’s ask the big question now.
33) 3) dialog: Enough. (as room quiets down) I can’t agree with any of you when you’re all talking at once. Now: I want to hear theories. Louise? Pink (05/18/2015) 50.
33) 7) dialog: How do we clarify their intention beyond those two words?
33) 20) dialog: What's going on? What was that explosion at Site Four? Halpern keeps his ear to his phone, but answers:
33) 24) dialog: It’s already started. Halpern leans in at one station and orders a Team Member:
34) 17) dialog: When was your last check-up with Kettler? Louise lets out a breath and passes him by, for the exit. Ian considers going with her. Weber gestures: Stay back. COLONEL WEBER (CONT’D) How about you?
34) 19) dialog: A lot of work for one person.
34) 21) dialog: Good. Learn as much as you can. In case we need to bench Doctor Banks.
34) 23) dialog: But if it does... Weber leaves Ian to consider this scenario.
37) 8) dialog: (via intercom) Explain. As she draws her logogram, she walks him through it:
37) 14) dialog: (over intercom) Get back to the weapon. Louise sighs and uses her keyboard to type as she asks al
38) 1) dialog: What is the answer?
38) 3) dialog: This is your new priority. No more language lessons until you crack it.
40) 22) dialog: Tan. You're needed in operations. Ian keeps his focus on Louise.
45) 1) dialog: May we come in? Louise frowns. INT. HOUSING PRE-FAB —- LIVING AREA - MOMENTS LATER 80 Louise, Weber, and Ian sit in this hotel-room-sized space
45) 4) dialog: You want to tell me what’s going on?
45) 6) dialog: You used seven words in the last session you never used before. And you wrote all of them in heptapod.
45) 8) dialog: You had three different exchanges no one on our side of the glass could follow.
45) 10) dialog: That’s not the problem here! Weber's getting more frustrated. Ian steps in to defuse:
45) 15) dialog: This might.
45) 17) dialog: Kettler tells me you signed it with your left hand. You’re right handed.
45) 19) dialog: It was one thing when no one could understand them. It’s another when no one but you can. (directed at Ian) You think you can manage in the room on your own now?
45) 23) dialog: (stands) I’m pulling you out. Louise and Ian follow. Louise intercepts Weber at the doo
45) 27) dialog: Which is why I can’t afford to lose you! Do you get it now? Suddenly frustrated by his confession, Weber steps back o into the cold. But Ian pauses outside her door. Turns aro to face Louise again. Louise looks devastated; untethered.
45) 30) dialog: Did you sleep?
45) 32) dialog: I need your brain.
45) 34) dialog: (evading) Do you know Mandarin?
46) 4) dialog: We don’t know what it means, either. But an hour ago China scrambled fighters at airfields in four different bases, and Sudan is following suit. “Big Domino” is about to start something.
46) 6) dialog: Maybe. Probably easier than trying to teach Mandarin. Why?
46) 8) dialog: ..-Everything’s a nail. Halpern enters, riled up. Steps up to Weber.
49) 3) dialog: (over headset) We got it over here. (to Tech) Christ, how much is this -- (back to Ian) It’s two terabytes of data. Yellow (06/11/2015) 80. Abbott begins miming the “walk” action they taught earlie Simultaneously, a new set of logograms form from ink splattered harshly against the glass --
50) 20) dialog: Not as far as we can tell. Ian is visibly relieved.
50) 22) dialog: What is it?
50) 24) dialog: Doctor Banks--
50) 26) dialog: Glad to see you’re awake.
50) 28) dialog: You’re not going back inside. 95 Pink (05/18/2015) 89A.
50) 30) dialog: What happened in there was an attack. We can hope for the best, but I have orders to prepare for a retaliation. So we’re leaving in twenty-four hours.
50) 33) dialog: Why does this feel worse. EXT. SCIENCE TENT — NIGHT 96 Outside, the canopy of stars above is staggering. The Shell remains in the sky, partially eclipsing the moo Tilting down to find the Ops Tent, bustling with activity
51) 37) dialog: You did your job, now he gets to run the show.
51) 54) dialog: (pre-lap) What did you just do? Louise seems to hear the voice beside her and look-- INT. OPERATIONS TENT - “WAR ROOM” - BACK TO SCENE 102 Weber stands at her side. Behind him, by a set of comms stations, Halpern and his team are on phones.
51) 56) dialog: Nobody locks horns with the CIA like that. What motivated you? Louise is still a bit lost, reeling from the effect she j had on her own memory.
51) 65) dialog: Maybe you see how that’s problematic for us now. PRESSING ON LOUISE, as the others discuss options:
51) 72) dialog: That isn’t the question.
51) 74) dialog: How do we get you back in the room when it’s half a mile straight up?

57) 6) dialog: What for?
60) 2) dialog: You two: We’re evacuating you right now. Come on.

60) 6) dialog: Good for you. He ushers them outside--
61) 2) dialog: So we can learn heptapod if we survive. Not much of a gift. Blue Draft (05/06/2015) 109.
61) 4) dialog: I see we are out of time. We did our best, but it wasn’t enough. The dominoes are falling now. Weber gestures at Ian to suggest: Get her on the chopper. Then he turns and hurries back for the ops tent. Louise stands, rigid with tension. Ian tugs at her:
