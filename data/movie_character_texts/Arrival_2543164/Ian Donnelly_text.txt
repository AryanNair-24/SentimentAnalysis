Nearby, two DRONE OPERATORS launch a surveillance drone i the air, which then flies ahead of the trucks, toward the shell. Leading the way. 37 Blue Draft (05/06/2015) 25. Louise and Ian are led into their pickup truck. Bench sea has been set up, but it all feels a bit cobbled together. Weber (in his suit and mask) nods at a LIEUTENANT who loc the tailgate into place for them and slaps the truck: The good to go. The truck starts for the Shell. Louise stares at it with wide eyes. Soon, the sun eclipse the ship and the whole truck succumbs to shadow. HIGH ANGLE: From a perch above the Shell: the two tiny tr slow as they arrive underneath it. EXT. “THE SHELL” - MOMENTS LATER 37 The craft is even more intimidating close-up. Its surface the undercarriage portion seems to absorb light. It’s also floating twenty or so feet overhead.

Noticing the lowe gravity here. How easy it would be to float away. That’s just what TECH 1 and TECH 2 do -- they grab their gear, bend at the knees, and then launch upward in a floa slow-motion leap... Yellow (06/11/2015) 26a. Ian lets out a spontaneous little LAUGH as he sees them g slowly righting themselves to the shift in gravity until they’re both standing next to the glowstick. Captain Marks follows, like it’s nothing; like it’s a com to a job. Ian looks to Louise, as if they're both at the top of a r in a theme park and he’s looking to see if she goes first She’s terrified. So he jumps. 39 Pink (05/18/2015) 27. Ian lands gently, maybe twenty feet up. He looks down at them, opens his mouth to say something, can’t figure out answer, so instead he turns to face the “top” of the tunn And he slowly walks after the Techs.

The TECHS with Weber and Marks quickly set up an arsenal video, audio, and other recording equipment to face this glass-like partition. Chemical sniffers. IR and UV camera Barometers. And most disturbingly, an old-tech detection among the high-tech: A CANARY IN A CAGE. On the other side, the room seems empty. Louise and Ian are speechless. Their breathing is loud in their ears.
