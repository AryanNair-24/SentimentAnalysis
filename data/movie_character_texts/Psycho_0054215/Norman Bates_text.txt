He waits a moment, after they ha closed their cabin door, then crosses to the pickup truck CAMERA MOVES with him. He studies the truck, then leans i through the driver's window, twists the registration card around, reads it. It gives the correct name and address of Sam Loomis. Norman comes back out of the window, glances once more to cabin twelve, then at the old house. His suspicions are  confirmed, and now there is the relaxation of relief in h face.

112) 0) text: Lila is standing in the doorway, staring at the room in s dismay. The room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fant of childhood held beyond the point of decency. It is a small room. The walls are fancied with romping  silhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels an fat cows jumping over aghast moons. The bed is small, far too short for a man of Norman's height. And yet the rumpl covers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps Next to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest. On its top there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. A grown m shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree. Against one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled  with thick, unchildish-looking books. On the small, white chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. The r on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to b Beethoven's Eroica Symphony. Lila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. She glanc at the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcas and pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book. She opens it. Her eyes go wide in shock. And then there is disgust. She slams the book closed, drops it.

Sam enters, pauses Norman turns, back against the window, as unable to fly a as are the many still, stuffed birds. Sam registers a bri flicker of reaction when he sees the birds, but continues gaze at Norman, hard.
114) 2) dialog: Where's that girl? The girl you came  with! Where is she? Sam does not respond, smiles a half-smile, turns to exami a stuffed owl. Norman looks back at the house.

115) 0) text: Lila, shaken and disturbed, almost sickened, is coming ou of Norman's room. She has left the light on. She pauses i the middle of the landing, looks at the closed door oppos the stairs, goes to it, opens it, sees that it is the  bathroom, pulls the door to, turns, starts toward the sta
116) 0) text: Sam is lying on the floor, face downward, unmoving. A  candlestick is on the floor, close by his head, still roc as if just dropped. OVER SHOT comes the SOUND of Norman's footsteps and CAMERA TURNS in time to catch a brief glimp of him going out into the office, almost at a run.
118) 0) text: For a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps cannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers t stairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction. Th SOUND of Norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard. Lila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the  basement, going down far enough to conceal herself, crouc there. Norman enters the hallway, closes the door softly, listen He glances once in the direction of the basement stairs. seems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanish from his face, and he appears to enter a no-place, no-tim state. He crosses to the stairway, goes up. Lila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening t the SOUNDS of Norman. His footsteps on the stairs followe by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about upstairs room. Convinced that he is searching the upstair for her, she decides to chance an escape. She starts up t steps, is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is  caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement. She pa looks down, sees the crack of light coming from behind th not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar. The swift m SOUNDS of Norman continue to come from upstairs. Lila is torn, knows she should get out of the house while she has the chance, is unable to resist the impulse to ch that hidden-looking room down below, a room in which, she desperately believes, there must lie some answer to what  happened to Mary. She turns and goes softly and quickly d the stairs.
120) 3) dialog: His face is contorted. He wears a wild wig, a mockery of woman's hair. He is dressed in a high-neck dress which is similar to that worn by the corpse of his mother. His han is raised high, poised to strike at Lila. There is a long breadknife in it.
123) 19) text: To understand it, as I understood it  hearing it from the mother...  That  is, from the mother-half of Norman's  mind, you have to go back ten years...  to the time when Norman murdered his  mother and her lover. (A pause, then as no  one interrupts)
123) 20) text: He was already dangerously disturbed,  had been ever since his father died.  His mother was a clinging, demanding  woman... and for years the two of  them lived as if there was no one  else in the world. Then she met a  man and it seemed to Norman she "threw  him over" for this man. That pushed  him over the thin line... and he  killed them both. Matricide is  probably the most unbearable crime  of all... and most unbearable to the  son who commit it. So he had to erase  the crime, at least in his own mind. (A pause)
123) 21) text: He stole her corpse... and a weighted  coffin was buried. He hid the body  in the fruit cellar, even "treated"  it to keep it as well as it would  keep. And that still wasn't enough.  She was there, but she was a corpse.   So he began to think and speak for  her, gave her half his life, so to  speak. At times he could be both  personalities, carry on  conversations... at other times, the  mother-half took over completely. He  was never all Norman, but he was  often only mother. And because he  was so pathologically jealous of  her, he assumed she was as jealous  of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong  attraction to any other woman, the  mother side of him would go wild. (To Lila)
123) 22) text: When Norman met your sister, he was  touched by her... and aroused by  her. He wanted her. And this set off  his "jealous mother" and...  "mother  killed the girl." After the murder,  Norman returned as if from a deep  sleep... and like a dutiful son,  covered up all traces of the crime  he was convinced his mother had  committed.
123) 27) text: That's what I meant when I said I  got the story from the mother. She  thinks Norman has been taken away...  because of his crimes.  She insists  she did nothing, that Norman committed  all the murders just to keep her  from being discovered. She even smiled  a bit coquettishly as she said that.  Of course, she feels badly about  it... but also somewhat relieved to  be, as she put it, free of Norman,  at last. (A pause)
123) 28) text: When the mind houses two  personalities, there is always a  battle. In Norman's case, the battle  is over... and the dominant  personality has won. Lila begins to weep softly, for Mary, for Arbogast, for  Norman, for all the destroyed human beings of this world. Sam bends beside her, puts his arm about her, comforts he
125) 0) text: The walls are white and plain. There is no window. There is no furniture except the straight-back chair in w Norman sits, in the center of the room. The room has a qu of no-whereness, of calm separation from the world. The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees Norman, as we come upon him, is lifting the blanket, unfo it. His face, although without makeup and without the  surrounding softness of the wig, has a certain femininity about it, a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch  womanliness about the brows. Calmly, Norman places the blanket about his shoulders, as it were a cashmere shawl. CAMERA REMAINS in a position so that our view of Norman is a FULL ONE. When the shawl is position, and Norman is settled, we HEAR, OVER SHOT, the  voice of his mother, coming from the calm of his thoughts
125) 3) text: Well, they know I can't even move a  finger. And I won't. I'll just sit  here and be quiet. Just in case they  do... suspect me. A fly buzzes close, and then continues buzzing and flying about Norman's face.
125) 5) text: I'm not going to swat that fly. I  hope they are watching. They'll see...  they'll see... and they'll know...  and they'll say... 'why, she wouldn't  even harm a fly...' Norman continues to gaze ahead into nothing.
