Norman stares at Sam, as if he'd like to yell at him, cal him "liar." Instead he reaches under the desk counter, br out the registration book. Lila moves closer, studies the book as Sam signs in. Sam signs "Joe and Mrs. Johnson." signature and city of "Marie Samuels" and after it, the  notation "Cabin One," can be clearly seen three registrat above Sam's.

Norman comes back out of the window, glances once more to cabin twelve, then at the old house. His suspicions are  confirmed, and now there is the relaxation of relief in h face.

101) 11) dialog: There must be some proof that exists  right now! Something that proves he  got that money away from Mary...  Some way!
101) 13) dialog: Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or  felt sorry for me... and he was  starting to feel the same about you.  I heard it when he called... in his  voice, a caring. He wouldn't have  gone anywhere or done anything without  telling us.  Unless he was stopped.  And he was stopped, so he must have  found out something! Sam considers a moment, nods agreement, rises.

He continues to stare, mor interested suddenly, as if bothered by some off-key evide he can't put his finger on. Then he looks at the shower  curtain rod. And realizes there is no shower curtain. He frowns, is ab to say something when Lila, who has been momentarily out shot, interrupts.

112) 0) text: Lila is standing in the doorway, staring at the room in s dismay. The room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fant of childhood held beyond the point of decency. It is a small room. The walls are fancied with romping  silhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels an fat cows jumping over aghast moons. The bed is small, far too short for a man of Norman's height. And yet the rumpl covers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps Next to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest. On its top there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. A grown m shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree. Against one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled  with thick, unchildish-looking books. On the small, white chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. The r on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to b Beethoven's Eroica Symphony. Lila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. She glanc at the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcas and pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book. She opens it. Her eyes go wide in shock. And then there is disgust. She slams the book closed, drops it.

Norman enters the hallway, closes the door softly, listen He glances once in the direction of the basement stairs. seems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanish from his face, and he appears to enter a no-place, no-tim state. He crosses to the stairway, goes up. Lila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening t the SOUNDS of Norman. His footsteps on the stairs followe by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about upstairs room. Convinced that he is searching the upstair for her, she decides to chance an escape. She starts up t steps, is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is  caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement. She pa looks down, sees the crack of light coming from behind th not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar. The swift m SOUNDS of Norman continue to come from upstairs. Lila is torn, knows she should get out of the house while she has the chance, is unable to resist the impulse to ch that hidden-looking room down below, a room in which, she desperately believes, there must lie some answer to what  happened to Mary. She turns and goes softly and quickly d the stairs.

It is the body of a woman long dead. The skin is dry and pulled away from the mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeleton's smi The eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the n has collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are  sunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged an flaky. The body is dressed in a high-neck, clean, well-pr dress, obviously recently laundered and hand-ironed. The movement of this stuffed, ill-preserved cadaver, turn as if in response to Lila's call and touch, is actually  graceful, ballet-like, and the effect is terrible and obs Lila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment, then begi to scream, a high, piercing, dreadful scream.

At times he could be both  personalities, carry on  conversations... at other times, the  mother-half took over completely. He  was never all Norman, but he was  often only mother.
