35) 0) text: Just a few seconds later. LAURA swings open the door, having made a hurried attempt at normality. Her hair is tidier, but she is still in the robe. At the back door. KITTY is standing, a little younger than LAURA, and more confident, with a voluptuous, good-looking presence: well made-up, well turned out, at ease. (CONTINUED)
35) 6) dialog: Are you all right? KITTY comes through the door. It's true: LAURA looks a little wild-eyed, desperate.
35) 8) dialog: Hi, Richie!
35) 10) dialog: Please. RICHIE is on the floor, observing from a distance. KITTY sits at the kitchen table and sees the sugary heap.
35) 11) dialog: Oh look -- you made a cake.
35) 13) dialog: Honestly, Laura, I don't know why you find it so difficult.
35) 15) dialog: Anyone can make a cake.
35) 19) dialog: Everyone can. It's ridiculously easy. Like I bet you didn't grease the pan.
35) 21) dialog: All right, but you have other virtues. And Dan loves you so much he won't even notice. Whatever you do, he's going to say it's wonderful. LAURA looks at her reproachfully and pushes KITTY'S coffee across to her.
35) 22) dialog: Well it's true.
35) 24) dialog: Sure he does.
35) 26) dialog: September. We go to the country club. We always go to the country club. We drink Martinis and spend the day with fifty people.
35) 28) dialog: He does.
35) 33) dialog: Ray's fine. Hmm. They both smile.
35) 34) dialog: These guys are something, aren't they?
35) 36) dialog: What did they deserve?
35) 38) dialog: Oh. You're reading a book?
35) 40) dialog: What's this one about?
35) 45) dialog: Well.
35) 47) dialog: I have to go into the hospital for a ‘couple of days.
35) 49) dialog: I have some kind of growth in... in my uterus. They're going to go in and take a look.
35) 51) dialog: This afternoon. LAURA just looks at her, not knowing how to respond.
35) 52) dialog: I need you to feed the dog.
35) 56) dialog: It's probably what the trouble's been. About getting pregnant. KITTY looks at LAURA a moment, unused to confidences. (CONTINUED)
35) 61) dialog: The thing is, I mean, you know, I've been really happy with Ray, but well... now it turns out there was a reason... there was a reason I couldn't conceive. You're lucky, Laura. I don't think you can call yourself a woman until you're a mother. LAURA looks down at her own stomach. KITTY looks away.
35) 62) dialog: The joke is: all my life I could do everything -- I mean, I can do anything -- really -- I never had any trouble -- except the one thing I wanted.
35) 64) dialog: That's all.
35) 66) dialog: That's right. That's what they're doing.
35) 68) dialog: I'm not worried. What would be the point of worrying?
35) 70) dialog: That's it. It's in the hands of some physician I've never met...
35) 74) dialog: ... some surgeon who probably drinks even more martinis than Ray, and no doubt always takes a six-iron to the green. Whatever that may mean. KITTY is losing it now, fighting to control her feelings.
35) 75) dialog: I mean, of course I'm worried for Ray.
35) 77) dialog: I'm doing fine. Really.
35) 79) dialog: If anything. I'm more worried about Ray. He's not good at this stuff.
35) 81) dialog: You're sweet. There is a brief moment, then LAURA turns and her eye falls on RICHIE who is on the floor with his toys. They had both forgotten him. He has watched throughout. KITTY stands up. (CONTINUED)
35) 84) dialog: You know the routine, right? Half a can in the evening, and check the water now and then. Ray will feed him in the morning. KITTY has got up to go.
35) 86) dialog: What? I didn't mind what? LAURA stands, anxious.
35) 88) dialog: I think I'll feel better if I drive myself.
35) 90) dialog: Of course it is. 'Bye. KITTY goes out. LAURA stands in the middle of the kitchen. She looks down at RICHIE who is still looking Silently up at her.
