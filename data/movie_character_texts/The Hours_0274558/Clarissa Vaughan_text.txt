15) 1) dialog: No, of course you must come. I mean it. I always wanted you to come. And everyone involved in the actual ceremony. CLARISSA acknowledges SALLY with a wave of the hand. SALLY turns and goes into the kitchen while CLARISSA goes back to the phone.
15) 2) dialog: I don't know. Around sixty. Well it will, it will mean so much. The whole occasion. And so the least I can do is have you all to dinner. Just to say thank you. I mean it. Of course. SALLY is gone into the kitchen to pour hot coffee. She looks into the sink at the wriggling crabs. (CONTINUED)
15) 6) dialog: Oh, I take that as a yes. Oh, that's great. I'm thrilled. 0h, good. SALLY smiles affectionately at how characteristic of CLARISSA this whole conversation has been.

17) 1) dialog: This is Clarissa Vaughan. Yes, I'm just confirming that you're sending the car to pick me up first. Yeah, and then we're going...
17) 3) dialog: Hi, hi, can't talk. CLARISSA waves and returns to her mobile.
17) 4) dialog: And then we're going over to six seventy-five Hudson. That's right. Between Fourteenth and Ninth. Then uptown. And there I will need you to wait. And it'll be over at seven. 21 22 13.

19) 3) dialog: I'm having a party! My friend Richard's won the Carrouthers.
19) 5) dialog: It's a poetry prize. For a life's work. It's the most prestigious. For a poet it's the best you can do.
19) 8) dialog: No. Too morbid. Hydrangeas, I think. And let's just have buckets of roses. Whatever. To hell with it. Spare no expense. CLARISSA picks out one bunch of flowers. (CONTINUED)
19) 11) dialog: I'm going to take these with me. BARBARA gets out armfuls of yellow roses and takes them to the desk, while an ASSISTANT takes the ones CLARISSA has picked out to take back herself. CLARISSA wanders up the other end. Now BARBARA is cutting the stalks and wrapping them.
19) 13) dialog: Oh, did you? I know it's not easy. BARBARA smiles, not unkindly, at the understatement.
19) 14) dialog: I know. It did take him ten years to write.
19) 17) dialog: What is?
19) 19) dialog: Oh, I see. Yeah. CLARISSA shrugs, half-pleased, half-embarrassed.
19) 20) dialog: I mean, in a way. Sort of. Richard's a writer. That's what he is. He uses things which actually happen.
19) 24) dialog: And years ago, he and I were students, it's true. But then he changes things.
19) 26) dialog: I don't mean in a bad way. BARBARA looks at her a moment. CLARISSA frowns.

A fluorescent panel splutters on the ceiling. CLARISSA heads for the cheerless graffiti-strewn freight elevator, closes the gate and rides upward.
26) 0) text: CLARISSA rings the bell of RICHARD'S apartment, then presses her face close to the door to listen.
26) 2) dialog: Yes, it's me.
26) 6) dialog: Richard, it's a beautiful morning. How about I let in a little light?
26) 8) dialog: It is. CLARISSA raises one of the shades. RICHARD barely moves to greet the light.
26) 11) dialog: Any visitors?
26) 13) dialog: Are they still here?
26) 15) dialog: How did they look?
26) 18) dialog: You don't sleep at all, do you? (CONTINUED)
26) 21) dialog: I saw three bluebirds on the way over. Do you think it's a good omen?
26) 24) dialog: The ceremony's at five. Do you Co remember?
26) 26) dialog: Then the party's after. CLARISSA has arranged the flowers and now she reappears in the doorway of Richard's room. CLARISSA looks at him tolerantly, the long-suffering look of nurse to patient. His complex cocktail of pills is laid out neatly ona table nearby.
26) 27) dialog: They did bring you breakfast, didn't they?
26) 29) dialog: You did eat it, Richard?
26) 35) dialog: I can't see it.
26) 37) dialog: I suppose.
26) 39) dialog: Of course it matters. You know what the doctors say. Have you been skipping pills? CLARISSA is frowning mistrustfully at the way the cocktail is laid out on the table but RICHARD is suddenly impatient, ignoring the question.
26) 41) dialog: Take what?
26) 43) dialog: Honey, it's not a performance.
26) 45) dialog: Well, that is nonsense.
26) 47) dialog: It's not true. (CONTINUED)
26) 51) dialog: Well, yes, as a matter of fact I do. RICHARD looks at her with an ironic gleam of doubt.
26) 53) dialog: What?
26) 55) dialog: You haven't gotten it yet. It's tonight.
26) 57) dialog: Richard, it's a party. It's only a party. Populated entirely by people who respect and admire you.
26) 59) dialog: Your friends.
26) 67) dialog: Why do you say that?
26) 69) dialog: Why?
26) 71) dialog: So? RICHARD gets up, heaving himself across the room on a crutch.
26) 77) dialog: Yes. I suppose we do.
26) 79) dialog: Yes.
26) 81) dialog: Of course.
26) 85) dialog: I'm right here.
26) 92) dialog: Would I be angry if you didn't show up at the party?
26) 94) dialog: If you died? Would I be angry if you died?
26) 96) dialog: What do you mean? Who's it for? What are you asking? What are you trying to say?
26) 99) dialog: So? Well? That's what we do. That's what people do. They stay alive for each other. The doctors told you: you don't need to die. The doctors told you that. You can live like this for years.
26) 101) dialog: I don't accept this. I don't accept what you're saying.
26) 105) dialog: No.
26) 107) dialog: Doing what?
26) 110) dialog: Richard, it would be great if you did come. If you felt well enough to come. Just to let you know: I'm making the crab thing. Not that I imagine it makes any difference.
26) 113) dialog: Yes? RICHARD raises his head slightly for her to kiss him. CLARISSA puts her lips next to his, with great tenderness, not to hurt him. Then she squeezes his shoulder. (CONTINUED)

Through the front door, full of cheerfulness, comes SALLY, carrying armfuls of dry cleaning and a load of Balducci bags.
33) 4) dialog: In here. SALLY has put the bags down in the kitchen, and is beginning to get oranges out of them.

LOUIS WATERS is leonine, silvery, handsome, in his late 40s, casually but perfectly dressed: a once-startlingly good- looking man, now a little faded. He is nervous. It's taken him an effort to RING the BELL. After a moment he hears CLARISSA'S voice.
44) 1) dialog: Yes?
44) 3) dialog: Louis? My God. You're early.
45) 0) text: CLARISSA has pressed the BUZZER and LOUIS is coming into the vestibule of the building. As he does, CLARISSA swings open the door of the apartment to greet him. She has an apron around her waist and green plastic gloves on. Her hair is a mess and LOUIS has plainly interrupted her in mid-work. She is listening to a CD, which is BOOMING out behind her.
45) 1) dialog: Why should I mind? I'm delighted.
45) 4) dialog: Why, no.
45) 6) dialog: Richard's going to be thrilled. He'll be thrilled to see you.
45) 8) dialog: Of course. Of course he will. There's just a moment's hesitation.

47) 6) dialog: How's San Francisco?
47) 8) dialog: Richard said he thought you were happy out there.
47) 10) dialog: Louis, you have to prepare yourself. He's very changed. LOUIS has picked out a copy of RICHARD'S book from CLARISSA'S shelves. CLARISSA goes back to her cooking.
47) 12) dialog: Oh, God!
47) 14) dialog: Well...
47) 20) dialog: You know how Richard is. It's a fantasy.
47) 23) dialog: His mother kills herself.
47) 25) dialog: Well...
47) 27) dialog: I know the book is tough. But I liked it. I know. Only one thing upset me.
47) 32) dialog: Well... that there wasn't more about you.
47) 35) dialog: You did?
47) 37) dialog: No. But then I never see you.
47) 39) dialog: I think you're courageous.
47) 41) dialog: To dare to go visit. LOUIS frowns.
47) 42) dialog: What I mean is: to face the fact we've lost those feelings forever. CLARISSA'S eyes are full of tears, and she seems to have forgotten LOUIS is there.
47) 43) dialog: Shit.
47) 47) dialog: I don't know what's happening. I'm sorry. I seem to be in some strange sort of mood. I seem to be unraveling...
47) 49) dialog: No, it's not you. Really. It's more... it's like having a presentiment. Do you know what I'm saying? CLARISSA wipes her eyes, tries to make light of it.
47) 50) dialog: Oh, God, it's probably just nerves about the party. Bad hostess. Suddenly CLARISSA sinks to the floor, not able to control herself anymore.
47) 52) dialog: Jesus!
47) 54) dialog: Oh, God!
47) 56) dialog: No. Don't go. Explain to me! Why is this happening? LOUIS moves towards her to try and reassure her by taking her in his arms. (CONTINUED)
47) 59) dialog: It's too much. It's just too much. You fly in from San Francisco. I've been nursing Richard for years...
47) 61) dialog: And all that time I've held myself together... no problem... There's a silence. Neither of them can say anything. CLARISSA just looks pleadingly at him from the floor.
47) 63) dialog: One morning. In Wellfleet. You were there. We were all there. I'd been sleeping with him and I was on the back porch. He came out. He put his hand on my shoulder. 'Good morning, Mrs. Dalloway.' CLARISSA is lost a moment in the memory.
47) 64) dialog: And ever since then, I've been stuck.
47) 66) dialog: I mean, with the name. There's a silence. Then CLARISSA gestures towards LOUIS, co to divert. (CONTINUED)
47) 69) dialog: Anyway, it doesn't matter. It was you he stayed with. It was you he lived with. I had one summer. You'll see when he comes. He's still Richard. His mind wanders and he's in a lot of pain. But there's some constant quality. There's his Richard-ness. LOUIS moves towards her, careful about what he wants to spell out.
47) 71) dialog: So. You must tell me about San Francisco.
47) 73) dialog: They can't all be idiots.
47) 76) dialog: o Really? (CONTINUED)
47) 80) dialog: A student?
47) 84) dialog: A little. Thank you. CLARISSA goes to the sink. LOUIS is suddenly embarrassed.
47) 86) dialog: Ridiculous. Fortunate, too.
64) 0) text: LOUIS lets the outside door of CLARISSA'S apartment building close behind him. He stands a moment at the top of the steps, full of relief to have left. Then, gratefully, he goes on his way.
65) 0) text: CLARISSA closes the door of the apartment and goes back into her living room, intending to resume her preparations for the party. But instead she stands, in the middle of the room, now bereft. She does not move.

68) 2) dialog: Julia. How you've been doing?
68) 6) dialog: Come here. What've you been doing? ‘ JULIA Well, studying, Mom. JULIA eases out of her mother's needy embrace, blithely to take off her backpack.
68) 8) dialog: Oh. Can you clear my desk? CLARISSA'S desk is covered in books which JULIA now clears by carrying them through to the bedroom. As she goes she calls back to her mother.
68) 10) dialog: You did. Where?
68) 13) dialog: I can see that he's sad.
68) 18) dialog: All it is: I looked around this room. I thought, I'm giving a party. All I want to do is just give a party.
68) 20) dialog: I know why he does it! He does it deliberately!
68) 22) dialog: Of course! JULIA smiles to herself, as if she's used to it.
68) 23) dialog: He looks at me. He did it this morning. He gave me that look.
68) 25) dialog: Oh, to say: ‘You're trivial, your life is so trivial. Daily stuff, schedules. Parties. Details.' CLARISSA turns, suddenly protesting.
68) 26) dialog: That's what he means by it. That's what he's saying!
68) 31) dialog: When I'm with him, then, yes, I'm living. That's what I feel. And when I'm not, yes, things seem kind of silly. JULIA walks away to the bedroom, struck by her mother's tactlessness.
68) 32) dialog: I don't mean with you. Never with you. But the rest of it.
68) 34) dialog: The rest of it. False comfort. CLARISSA has followed JULIA into the bedroom and now they lie down, side by side, on the bed.
68) 35) dialog: If you say to me: when was I happiest?
68) 37) dialog: Tell me the moment you were happiest...
68) 39) dialog: Yes.
68) 41) dialog: I remember one morning. Getting up at dawn. There was such a sense of possibility. We were going to do everything. Do you know that feeling? (CONTINUED)
68) 44) dialog: I remember thinking: 'This is the beginning of happiness.' That's what I thought. 'So this is the feeling. This is where it starts. And of course there'll always be more.' It never occurred to me: it wasn't the beginning. It was happiness. It was the moment, right then. There is a silence. JULIA looks thoughtfully at her mother. Then the DOOR BUZZER sounds. CLARISSA goes to the intercom, and a VOICE calls through: "Caterers."

82) 3) dialog: Richard, Richard, it's me. I'm early. I know. She puts her key in the lock and opens the door. The blinds have been pulled up and the curtains parted for the first time. In full light at last, it looks like the apartment of a madman -- piles of cardboard boxes, a filthy bathtub, books flung everywhere. CLARISSA moves forward in astonishment.
82) 4) dialog: Richard! What the hell's going on?
82) 6) dialog: Richard, what are you doing? What's going on? RICHARD looks at her from across the room, his eyes gleaming.
82) 8) dialog: Richard, what are you doing?
82) 10) dialog: Richard! RICHARD screams at her. (CONTINUED)
82) 15) dialog: All right, do me one favor, Richard, do me one simple favor...
82) 17) dialog: You don't have to go to the party. You don't have to go to the ceremony. RICHARD'S face darkens. CLARISSA shouts in desperation.
82) 18) dialog: You don't have to do anything, Richard! You can do what you like!
82) 20) dialog: You have good days still, Richard. You know you do.
82) 22) dialog: Are they here, Richard? (CONTINUED)

82) 42) dialog: And... I went out to get flowers -- just like Mrs. Dalloway -- in the book, do you know?
82) 44) dialog: -- it was a beautiful morning.

94) 0) text: CLARISSA is in the kitchen with SALLY and JULIA. Every surface is taken up with food for the party which never happened. CLARISSA has the crab dish in her hand and is emptying it sadly into the bin. She is still in the coat she was wearing all afternoon. As she dumps the wasted food, she hears a RING at the DOOR. CLARISSA goes to the apartment door and opens it. LAURA BROWN is standing directly opposite. She is now in her early 80s, slightly stooped with steel-gray hair and parchment skin. She is wearing a dark, floral dress and coat. CLARISSA is taken aback for a moment. (CONTINUED)
94) 3) dialog: You're Laura Brown.
94) 5) dialog: Of course. CLARISSA reaches out her hand.
94) 6) dialog: I'm Clarissa Vaughan. Come in. LAURA has a small bag which CLARISSA now lifts for her as she leads her into the apartment. At the end of the corridor SALLY is standing with JULIA behind her, but CLARISSA signals tactfully for them to hold off a moment, as she leads LAURA into the sitting room. Throughout the apartment, dinner tables have been set with white table cloths, and glasses. CLARISSA is alone with LAURA in the sitting room.
94) 7) dialog: My friend Sally's in the kitchen. And my daughter. LAURA just looks at her a moment, not answering.
94) 8) dialog: We were having a party. We were going to have a party.

99) 0) text: The corridor of the apartment. Everyone else has gone to bed. CLARISSA, in her white pajamas, is in the kitchen turning off the lights one by one. As she turns off the last one in the kitchen, she comes into the corridor, and begins the same process. She looks round briefly at her own home: comfortable, solid, complete. At last she seems at peace. As she turns out the lights in the corridor, the voice of VIRGINIA WOOLF is heard.
