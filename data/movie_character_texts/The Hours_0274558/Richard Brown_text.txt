26) 0) text: CLARISSA rings the bell of RICHARD'S apartment, then presses her face close to the door to listen.
26) 1) dialog: (inside) Mrs. Dalloway, it's you.
26) 3) dialog: (inside) Come in. CLARISSA turns the lock with her own key and goes in to a desolate loft space. The first space is in near darkness, a gloomy kitchen-bathroom area. CLARISSA picks her way carefully through to the second, larger space -- the living area -- where the man at the window is sitting, pale, stick-limbed, in a rotting armchair which is covered in towels. RICHARD is in his late 40s, gaunt from AIDS, a noble skull merely, his boxer's nose and high forehead lit by a streak of light from between the blinds. He is wearing a blue robe with child-like drawings of rockets and astronauts on it. The whole place is bleached, chaotic, more or less bare of ornament. This is a man who has pared his life down to very little. (CONTINUED)
26) 7) dialog: Is it still morning?
26) 9) dialog: Have I died? Am I alive? CLARISSA bends over and kisses his forehead.
26) 10) dialog: Good morning, my dear.
26) 12) dialog: Yes.
26) 14) dialog: No. They've gone.
26) 16) dialog: Today? Sort of like black fire. I mean, sort of light and dark at the same time. There was one a bit like an electrified jellyfish. CLARISSA looks at him a moment, then picks up the flowers.
26) 17) dialog: They were singing. It may have been Greek.
26) 22) dialog: Do you believe in omens? Omens would mean someone was looking after us, someone was watching. Do you believe anyone's watching? Do they send signs? RICHARD makes a sort of grin, amused at the idea.
26) 23) dialog: I mean, I'd love to believe it.
26) 25) dialog: Do I? Do I remember?
26) 28) dialog: What a question. Of course.
26) 30) dialog: Well can you see it? Is there any o breakfast lying around? (CONTINUED)
26) 36) dialog: Well, then, I must have eaten it, mustn't I?
26) 38) dialog: Does it matter?
26) 40) dialog: Clarissa, I can't take this.
26) 42) dialog: Having to be proud and brave in front of everybody.
26) 44) dialog: Of course it is. I got the prize for my performance.
26) 46) dialog: I got the prize for having AIDS and going nuts and being brave about it. I actually got the prize for having come through.
26) 50) dialog: For surviving. That's what I got the prize for. You think they'd give it to me if I were healthy?
26) 52) dialog: Is it here somewhere?
26) 54) dialog: The prize. I'd like to look at it.
26) 56) dialog: Are you sure? I remember the ceremony perfectly. I seem to have fallen out of time. CLARISSA waits a moment, trying to be patient.
26) 58) dialog: Ah, small party, is it? Select party, is it?
26) 60) dialog: I thought I lost all my friends. I drove my friends crazy. RICHARD reaches out and touches the flowers.
26) 61) dialog: ‘Oh Mrs. Dalloway, always giving parties to cover the silence...' (CONTINUED)
26) 64) text: Richard, you won't need to do anything. All you have to do is appear, sit on the sofa. And I will be there. This is a group of people who want to tell you your work's going to live.
26) 65) dialog: Is it? Is my work going to live? RICHARD looks at her without pity.
26) 66) dialog: I can't go through with it, Clarissa.
26) 68) dialog: I can't.
26) 70) dialog: Because I wanted to be a writer, that's all.
26) 72) dialog: I wanted to write about it all. Everything that's happening in a moment. The way those flowers looked when you carried them in your arms -- this towel, how it smells, how it feels -- this thread -- all our feelings, yours and mine. The history of who we once were. Everything that's in the world. Everything mixed up. Like it's all mixed up now. RICHARD'S eyes fill with tears. (CONTINUED)
26) 75) dialog: And I failed. Whatever you start with, it ends up so much less. Sheer fucking pride and stupidity. RICHARD slumps down again. CLARISSA watches, part impatient, part helpless.
26) 76) dialog: We want everything, don't we?
26) 78) dialog: You kissed me on a beach...
26) 80) dialog: You remember?
26) 82) dialog: How many years ago? CLARISSA shakes her head, too overwhelmed to answer.
26) 83) dialog: What did you want then? Again, CLARISSA says nothing. She is as upset as he is.
26) 84) dialog: Come here, come closer, would you please?
26) 86) dialog: Take my hand. CLARISSA takes his painfully-thin hand, a handful of twigs.
26) 87) dialog: Would you be angry? (CONTINUED)
26) 93) dialog: No. Would you be angry if I died?
26) 95) dialog: Who's this party for?
26) 97) dialog: I'm not trying to say anything! I'm saying! CLARISSA is panicking now.
26) 98) dialog: I think I'm only staying alive to satisfy you. CLARISSA is looking at him, aghast.
26) 100) dialog: Well exactly. RICHARD smiles, CLARISSA bitterly shakes her head, firm now.
26) 102) dialog: Oh, what? And it's you to decide is it? (CONTINUED)
26) 106) dialog: How long have you been doing this?
26) 108) dialog: How many years, coming to the apartment? What about your own life? What about Sally? Just wait till I die. Then you'll have to think of yourself. CLARISSA doesn't answer. RICHARD smiles, sure of his point.
26) 109) dialog: How are you going to like that? CLARISSA lets go of his hand, disturbed. RICHARD just looks at her. CLARISSA gets up and stands a moment, shaken. Then speaks quietly.
26) 111) dialog: Of course it makes a difference. I love the crab thing. CLARISSA is about to leave but RICHARD calls across to her.
26) 112) dialog: Clarissa?
26) 117) dialog: Wonderful. CLARISSA goes out. The sound of the apartment DOOR being RE-OPENED and then CLOSED. RICHARD is alone.
26) 118) dialog: Wonderful.
33) 0) text: CLARISSA is sitting immobilized in the second bedroom. The room is stacked with spare furniture which has been cleared away to make room for the party. CLARISSA has sat down on a hard chair, still trying to recover from her earlier encounter with RICHARD. Through the front door, full of cheerfulness, comes SALLY, carrying armfuls of dry cleaning and a load of Balducci bags.
79) 0) text: RICHARD'S face seen from the exact SAME POINT OF VIEW. The child has become the man. RICHARD is sitting in the near dark, a gleam of light catching the sweat on his forehead. He has not moved from his chair, nor has he dressed. He sits thinking back to the scene in the car. LAURA'S voice is heard in RICHARD'S head.
81) 0) text: Beside RICHARD, a photograph of his mother, LAURA, on her wedding day, eyes down. RICHARD looks at it, the extreme sweat of illness running down his face.
82) 0) text: CLARISSA, in a repeat of the morning's progress, comes to the door of RICHARD'S apartment and rings the bell to warn him of her presence. (CONTINUED)
82) 5) dialog: What are you doing here? You're early. RICHARD is pushing furniture to the side. He looks like an exalted scarecrow, his hair plastered to his skull. He's high as a kite, and still dressed in his bathrobe and pajamas. Immediately behind him, he has opened the window wide. CLARISSA looks in horror.
82) 7) dialog: Clarissa, I had this wonderful idea. I needed some light. I needed to let in some light. RICHARD moves toward the window.
82) 9) dialog: I had this fantastic notion. I took the Xanax and the Ritalin together. It had never occurred to me.
82) 13) dialog: Don't come near me! CLARISSA stops. RICHARD scrambles painfully to the windowsill and lifts one leg over the sill, so that he is perched, bony, weightless, with the other foot still on the apartment floor. CLARISSA stands, trying to be caln.
82) 14) dialog: It seemed to me I needed to let in some light. What do you think? I cleared away all the windows.
82) 16) dialog: I don't think I can make it to the party, Clarissa. I'm sorry.
82) 19) dialog: But I have to face the hours, don't I? The hours after the party. And the hours after that.
82) 21) dialog: Not really. It's kind of you to say so, but it isn't true. CLARISSA is stopped dead, full of fear at her next question.
82) 25) dialog: Who?
82) 27) dialog: Oh, the voices are always here.
82) 29) dialog: No, Mrs. Dalloway. It's you. CLARISSA looks at him, terrified now.
82) 30) dialog: I've stayed alive for you. RICHARD looks at her pleadingly.
82) 31) dialog: But now you have to let me go. CLARISSA looks at him, shocked by what he has said. But again as she moves toward him, he cuts her off.
82) 33) dialog: Tell me a story, all right?
82) 35) dialog: Tell me a story from your day. CLARISSA stops, fearing this is their last moment together.
82) 37) dialog: Yes? (CONTINUED)
82) 43) dialog: Yes.
82) 45) dialog: Was it?
82) 47) dialog: Fresh, was it?
82) 49) dialog: Like a morning on the beach?
82) 51) dialog: Like that?
82) 53) dialog: Fresh like when you and I were young? There is a silence. CLARISSA doesn't answer.
82) 54) dialog: Like the morning you walked out of that old house and you were eighteen, and maybe I was nineteen.
82) 58) dialog: I was nineteen years old and I'd never seen anything so beautiful. You, coming out of a glass door in the early morning, still sleepy. Isn't it strange?
82) 60) dialog: The most ordinary morning in anybody's life. RICHARD shakes his head slightly.
82) 61) dialog: Clarissa, I'm afraid I can't make the party.
82) 63) dialog: You've been so good to me, Mrs. Dalloway.
82) 65) dialog: I love you. CLARISSA stops, taken aback as he says it.
82) 66) dialog: I don't think two people could have been happier than we've been. There is a moment's silence. Then RICHARD inches forward, slides gently off the sill, and falls. CLARISSA screams.
83) 0) text: Silence. No sound. Seen FROM BELOW, RICHARD'S body floating slowly down from the fifth floor in the air. 86 87 88 85.
85) 0) text: RICHARD'S body lands against the concrete, SMASHING a BEER BOTTLE as it does. The corpse bounces, then settles, face down, his robe up over his face. Silence again.
