15) 17) dialog: Yeah, I know, time's kicked my ass  but good. Come on, Romeo, let's bury  the hatchet. Give me a hug. Careful  of the cocktail.
15) 19) dialog: So what the hell're you doin' around  here? Last I heard you were out in  earthquake country blowin' the family  fortune.
15) 21) dialog: Good for you!
15) 39) dialog: Sure, L.A.'s okay if you're a cactus  or a lizard, but if you're a New  Englander, your soul dries up and  blows away like a god damn leaf.
15) 41) dialog: So what're you doin' now? You owned  some restaurants out there, didn't  you?
15) 48) dialog: Kids! I want you to meet an old chum  of mine, the owner of this fine  establishment -- Wills Keane!
15) 50) dialog: And that over there's the birthday  girl -- my granddaughter, Charlotte.
15) 53) dialog: You bet. She got her height from her  dad. But her talent's all Katie's.
15) 55) dialog: Made it herself from scratch. That  one, too. (to Shannon) Honey, show 'im.
15) 69) dialog: Same here.
15) 77) dialog: (uneasily) From Newport. Old friend of your  mom's.
21) 4) dialog: Now, now, if you two kids can't play  nice --
40) 1) dialog: Well, well.
41) 1) dialog: She'll be right down. She's upstairs,  gildin' the lily. (shouting up the stairs) HE'S HERE! (wryly) Do come in.
42) 1) dialog: Excuse the mess. My maid died fourteen  years ago and it's been simply  impossible to replace her. She did  windows and spoke English.
42) 4) dialog: Well, aren't they loverly.
42) 6) dialog: Care for a cocktail?
44) 1) dialog: What can I say? Time's a thief. One  day you're rich as an Arab, the next  you're lucky if you can afford a god  damn can of pistachio nuts.
44) 3) dialog: How about that, huh? That was the  summer you two --
44) 5) dialog: Who'd have guessed what time had in  store for her, huh? Look at that  smile.
44) 7) dialog: Then again, time loves some people.  Like you, for instance. Oh, time's  just wild about you.
44) 9) dialog: Just as handsome and charming as  ever. And still up to the same old  tricks.
44) 12) dialog: First time you came to pick up Katie,  you brought me flowers. Just like  those. (to herself) Flower the mother; then deflower the  daughter. But Katie was too smart  for you...
44) 14) dialog: (abruptly) Aw, why the hell don't you leave her  alone? Christ, she's sick!
44) 17) dialog: You look like your mom is all.
72) 1) dialog: Well, if it ain't the Belle of  Amherst.
72) 3) dialog: Seen that face before.
72) 5) dialog: And for the same god damn reason.
72) 8) dialog: Sure, but she was nuts about him.  The only reason she didn't sleep  with him is 'cause she was  sentimental. And smart. She wanted a  ring first.
72) 10) dialog: 'Cause he knocked up little Millie  Tyler instead. In Newport. At Bailey's  Beach. During the Labor Day clam  bake.
72) 12) dialog: Millie was your mom's best friend  from Nightingale. You had to hand it  to him. He sure knew how to make a  point.
72) 15) dialog: Aw, who the hell knows? 'Cause the  moon was full. 'Cause life's short.  'Cause he's Wills Keane. I'll tell  you a little secret -- after that,  your Mom hated his guts, but your  dad never made her smile like he  did. (pause) 'Course your dad never made her cry  like that either.
72) 17) dialog: Oh, I dunno...
72) 20) dialog: Christ, look at me. I'm gonna tell  you what to do?
72) 22) dialog: Aw, you wouldn't listen. That's the  thing about people -- they just do  what they want from the day they're  born till the day they die.
72) 27) dialog: (fighting tears) Aw, come on, honey. I can throw a  party and I can mix a gimlet. After  that, what the fuck do I know?
104) 3) dialog: Fare is what you pay on the train to  Jersey. Fair is the place that smells  like manure where, if you're real  lucky, you win a blue ribbon for  your home-made pickles. Fair is a  sky without a cloud and a face with  a mark. Fare is food. What fair isn't  is everything else.
