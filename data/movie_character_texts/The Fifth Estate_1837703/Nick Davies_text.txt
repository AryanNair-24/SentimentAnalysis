You represent a terrifying future, they need to delegitimize all you stand for, the most powerful media machine on the planet is right now planning a smear campaign like none you've ever seen.
143) 6) text: Nick glances over at Daniel.
143) 12) dialog: An international media coalition. The Guardian, The Times, Der Spiegel, all standing with Wikileaks, legitimizing you as a news organization. Let the US attack, we print the news. And if we put you on the moral high ground, up with Mother Theresa and Nelson Mandela...

161) 31) dialog: Seventeen little keystrokes and anyone in the world can read what he publishes. And now that we've given him a goddamn megaphone, they will. (then, angry) He's not a source. He's a reckless, irresponsible head of a huge media empire that's accountable to no one. And we put him there.
161) 32) text: Over Nick, we PRELAP SARAH, SPEAKING IN ARABIC --
175) 7) text: THE IMAGE FADES and Daniel looks down, DEVASTATED. REVEAL Nick with him, taking NOTES. He stops, takes off his glasses.
175) 9) dialog: You know, there was a time when papers in Britain couldn't report on parliamentary debate. And then a few men started printing pamphlets, leaking the debates to the public. The men, well, I believe they were hanged, but the public saw those pamphlets and demanded access.
