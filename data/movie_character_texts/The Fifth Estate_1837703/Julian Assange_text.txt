85) 6) text: Julian reaches for the roast, PICKING at it WITH HIS FINGERS. Daniel blinks. This is who he's following into t abyss?
85) 9) dialog: 
85) 12) text: Daniel turns. Julian stands in the doorway.
85) 14) dialog: (CONTINUED)
85) 16) text: Julian pulls out his wallet, shows Daniel a picture.
85) 18) dialog: (CONTINUED)
85) 20) text: Daniel, stirred, stares at the photo of Julian's son.
85) 24) dialog: Daniel. His name is Daniel.
86) 4) text: Helgason turns to Daniel and Julian, beside him. We notic that Daniel has STARTED GROWING A BEARD...
86) 9) dialog: Protect free speech. Strengthen your laws, give activists in countries without freedom of the press a home. We have too many offshore tax havens, we need more offshore media havens.
87) 4) text: The crowd CHEERS as we FIND TWO IDENTICAL BACKPACKS in th midst. Julian and Daniel watch as Birgitta wraps up.
87) 8) dialog: And apparently our new spokesperson. Some animals are more equal than others.

88) 4) text: Daniel smiles, sees Julian dancing with THREE HOT WOMEN under a CHEAP DISCO BALL. Julian spreads his arms, calls him --

93) 26) text: This is Julian.
94) 4) text: Julian... I have horrible news.
95) 1) text: Julian GRIPS the phone, listening. 
96) 7) dialog: This can't be some mealy mouthed press release. Kibaki killed them, the language needs to be stronger.
96) 11) dialog: Give me the damn computer.
96) 12) text: Julian, IRRITATED, takes over, pushing Daniel out of the way. Birgitta sees how upset Julian is, leans in to comfo him.
96) 15) text: Julian keeps typing, FRUSTRATED...
96) 17) dialog: Yes, they wanted the world to know. It's an astonishing story, we put it on the front of the damn website and we couldn't get a single paper outside of Kenya to pick it up. (then, upset) We're not breaking though. They were my friends and I... if we'd gotten that report more publicity, they'd have been heroes. Murdering them would have had a political cost, Kibaki wouldn't have dared.
96) 21) dialog: (turning on him, HARSH) What the hell do you know about publicity? Outside of self- promotion? Sucking up to reporters, it's disgusting.
96) 25) dialog: Why don't you leave that to me.
96) 26) text: Julian grabs the laptop, stalks off. Daniel stands, NUMB.
98) 8) text: Sarah HANGS UP. An OPEN FOLDER is on the table, a PROFILE JULIAN. As she eyes it, an AIDE walks in.
101) 1) text: The lobby is crowded with hackers registering for 26C3. I corner, Marcus huddles with Daniel, Birgitta and Julian.
101) 5) dialog: (to Daniel, agitated) You let him on the primary server?
101) 9) dialog: We need to be careful who we trust.
101) 10) text: Julian glares at Marcus, it's awkward.
101) 14) dialog: Yes, I asked her. I have experience with these things, I don't make mistakes. At least not usually.
101) 19) dialog: You made a promise to me.
101) 20) text: Julian's angry. But more than that, he's HURT. BETRAYED. OTTO, the volunteer from the last Congress, walks up.
101) 23) text: Otto nods towards two blond men in suits by the registrat desk. WATCHING THEM. They're calm, PROFESSIONAL. The team TENSES, Julian quickly packing up. Birgitta leans in --

102) 1) text: The room is the same as two years ago but the contrast is ENORMOUS. A ROWDY CROWD of HUNDREDS cheer Julian and Dani
102) 9) text: Daniel catches Julian's eye, a moment of shared amazement they realize how much they've accomplished. WE HEAR a LOW HUM... PULL BACK... it's the AUDIENCE. ON ITS FEET. CHEERING.
102) 13) text: Hard to say whether it appeals to his vanity or his altruism, but Julian is clearly moved.
102) 15) dialog: Yes, security. That's the essence. Security guaranteed by anonymity. (working something out) Of course, as much as you try to protect, there will always be those who seek to destroy. But we, we make a promise to our sources...
102) 16) text: Julian glances over at Daniel. An admission.
102) 18) dialog: 
102) 20) text: Off Julian, looking at Daniel --

105) 23) dialog: Mr. and Mrs. Berg. Daniel didn't tell me you were coming.
105) 30) dialog: (taking Mrs. Berg's arm) I'd love to.
107) 1) text: A cozy living room. Mr. Berg brings a coke to Julian, who looks at one of many FRAMED PHOTOS on the mantle, 16-YEAR-OLD DANIEL in a JUDO ROBE, with a TROPHY and his BEAMING PARENTS.
107) 3) dialog: You all went?
107) 11) text: Julian STARTS. There's a CAT. It HISSES at him.
107) 14) text: Julian looks at Daniel. The cat is named Schmitt? Daniel shrugs as his father reaches for a stack of LOCAL PAPERS.
107) 23) dialog: We don't really bother with local press.
107) 26) text: Julian forces a smile, looks past the paper to the BOOKSHELF. Kropotkin, Chomsky. He turns to Daniel's fathe
107) 28) dialog: That's some collection. Quite the anarchist, hmm?
107) 31) dialog: (CONTINUED)
107) 33) text: Julian pulls down the Kropotkin. Daniel and his parents watch, frozen, as Julian stares at the book, OBLIVIOUS.
107) 35) dialog: (CONTINUED)
107) 41) dialog: (tossing the book aside) Where's the bathroom?
107) 42) text: Daniel nods. Julian grabs his backpack and heads off.
107) 47) text: But as he says it, Daniel catches a glimpse of a backpack and turns to see Julian HEADING OUT THE DOOR. 
108) 1) text: Like two years ago, East Berliners of all sorts in the ca club. But unlike two years ago, Julian's SURROUNDED by WO and GROUPIES. He's holding court, soaking up the attentio
108) 4) text: Julian turns as we FIND Daniel. Standing there. Pissed.
108) 6) dialog: Sorry, lost my appetite. You have to admit, they're a bit suffocating.
108) 7) text: Julian heads for a table.
108) 9) dialog: (CONTINUED)
108) 11) text: Julian pulls out the copy of WIRED UK from his backpack, flips to the article. EXPOSED: WIKILEAKS' SECRETS.
108) 13) dialog: (CONTINUED)
108) 19) dialog: Maybe you're used to people exaggerating your successes. But while you were out winning judo trophies with Mutti und Vati, I was studying information systems in a shitty squat outside Melbourne, obsessing over code in a hot flat in Paris, holding schizophrenic meetings with myself: the Chairman, the Secretary, sole volunteer and founder of a website no one had ever heard of. Including you.
108) 22) text: Daniel starts walking away. Julian calls out after him.
108) 24) dialog: (off the Wired piece) He adopted the nom de plume 'Schmitt' after his cat. (then) To think, I spent weeks reading Horace searching for the right nom de guerre. If only I'd had a cat.
108) 25) text: Julian tosses the Wired article at Daniel, turns back to groupies. As Daniel stands there... a KID we might recogn as ZIGGY, the 17-year-old from the OPEN, walks up to Juli
108) 29) dialog: We have hundreds of volunters... but we can always use loyal followers.
108) 32) text: Ziggy enthusiastically shakes Julian's hand. Julian pulls him in, eyeing Daniel... who turns to the bar, ORDERS A DRINK. Daniel POUNDS it, then TURNS BACK.
108) 33) text: He sees Ziggy and two hot women FAWN OVER Julian... As Julian whispers something to Ziggy, Daniel orders another drink. He POUNDS it, then TURNS BACK.
108) 34) text: The group laughs with Julian... laughing at Daniel? As th cute blond STARTS TO TRIM JULIAN'S HAIR, Birgitta leans in...
108) 37) text: Julian turns. A YOUNG INDIAN REPORTER waits in the door. As Julian beckons him over, Daniel orders another beer.
108) 38) text: Daniel POUNDS it, then TURNS BACK. He sees Julian, still holding court, the reporter now taking notes...
108) 40) dialog: I was divorced once. There was a terrible custody battle.
108) 44) dialog: Have you seen my hair?
108) 45) text: Ziggy, packing up Julian's bag, looks up, AWE ON HIS FACE And for a brief moment HE LOOKS JUST LIKE DANIEL DID WHEN MET JULIAN, no beard, no weariness in his eyes...
113) 29) text: What you've done, it's staggering. Julian didn't create that alone. The two of you, you're a team. Sure, he's the mad prophet, there's one at the heart of every revolution. But that's why most of them end badly. (and then) He needs boundaries, Daniel. He needs a line. You're the line.
114) 9) dialog: Passport control is such a bore.

115) 9) text: Julian stares BLANKLY at Nick.
115) 14) dialog: (to Ms. Lang, blithe) We have hundreds of volunteers.    I can't keep track of them all.
115) 20) text: Julian turns. Somewhat surprised --
115) 22) dialog: You believe me?
115) 25) text: Nick nods to TWO MEN in the corner, WATCHING THEM. Julian BLANCHES. It's the BLOND SPOOKS from the BCC. He starts t RISE, but Nick puts a hand on his shoulder.
115) 29) text: Nick glances over at TWO THICK RUSSIANS talking quietly a the bar. AND WATCHING THEM. Julian follows his gaze, ASHE
115) 33) text: Julian nods. Nick discreetly slips him a KEY, then stands
116) 5) text: Julian?
117) 1) text: A well-appointed European hotel room. A FRENETIC Julian paces beside Nick, who watches VIDEO on a laptop. In the b/g, Ms. Lang is on a hotel phone.
117) 3) dialog: 
117) 13) dialog: 
117) 24) text: Julian, what's going on?
117) 29) dialog: What, so the Guardian can take all the credit?
117) 30) text: Julian a BALL OF ENERGY, takes Lang's arm, walks her into
118) 1) text: Julian pulls Ms. Lang into the small bathroom.
118) 4) text: Julian --
118) 5) text: But Julian HANGS UP the phone, closes the bathroom door behind Ms. Lang and PULLS AT HER DRESS.
118) 10) dialog: If I'm going to slip out of the hotel, I'll need a disguise.
119) 3) dialog: (O.C.)
120) 2) text: Julian, in back, IN MS. LANG'S DRESS. Looking a bit crazy
120) 10) text: It's Nick from the Guardian. (then) Julian, what is going on?
120) 11) text: Off Julian's nervous smile, we SMASH TO --
121) 20) dialog: With cameras, mostly.
121) 21) text: Julian stands behind them.
121) 23) dialog: (CONTINUED)
121) 28) dialog: The Pentagon completely stonewalled them, it's a massive cover up.
121) 32) dialog: Nick thought so, I bet we could sell it to the Guardian for millions.
121) 35) text: Julian's considering it. Marcus and Birgitta look APPALLE
121) 38) text: Daniel holds Julian's gaze, then pushes on --
121) 43) dialog: A guy showed up in the chat, said he was US Military. (following Daniel's lead) But we'll want to track down the families of the victims.
121) 48) text: Ziggy SWALLOWS HARD. Julian watches Daniel with RENEWED APPRECIATION as he takes over, turning to Marcus...

123) 1) text: Julian stares out at the otherworldly landscape.
123) 4) text: Daniel walks up. Julian's a bit lost in thought.
123) 6) dialog: I've heard people say that I dangle somewhere on the autistic spectrum. It's probably why I lean so heavily on those around me.
123) 11) dialog: Ziggy's planning something at the Parliament building.
123) 14) text: Julian's momentarily flustered. Daniel pats him on the ba
123) 18) text: As Daniel exits, we HOLD ON Julian, who realizes what he means.

129) 4) dialog: 
129) 6) text: REVEAL Julian with his bags, TWO LAPTOPS open, HEADPHONES on, a MOBILE ROUTER beside him. He talks to one of the laptops.
129) 8) dialog: 
130) 1) text: Marcus is plugged in; Ziggy and a few staffers swirl arou Daniel talks to Julian.
130) 6) dialog: Yes, I just never figured brutal slaughter and my socks would get equal billing in The New York Times.
130) 7) text: Daniel smirks as Julian's cryptophone RINGS.
130) 9) dialog: 
130) 11) text: As Julian answers, Daniel's cryptophone rings. And sudden ALL THE OTHER PHONES IN THE ROOM ARE RINGING. Daniel turn SURPRISED, when HIS COMPUTER STARTS BEEPING.
130) 15) text: The same thing must be happening on Julian's side because STARES at his screen, his face going WHITE. Then, NUMB --

137) 19) text: Julian REACTS, VISIBLY ANGRY, starts BANGING on the keyboard.
137) 26) text: But they stop as Julian's chat FLIES ONTO THE SCREEN. jjj: MORE dangerous NOT to publish. jjj: once it's out, there is nothing they can do. jjj: AND. if we don't publish, what message does that send? jjj: find our source and you can stop us?
137) 33) text: Julian reacts as Daniel's chats fly across the screen. ddd: we don't know what's in the docs. ddd: you're putting people's lives in jeopardy. ddd: this is not the mission.
137) 35) dialog: Fuck you, you disloyal...
137) 36) text: The passenger beside him looks at Julian, UNEASY, as Juli POUNDS his keyboard, livid, CLOSING the chat window.
139) 9) text: Daniel STRUGGLES, eyes the text of the chat with Julian.
139) 12) text: You have to tell Julian, I'm already working on a story to paint this as the next Pentagon Papers, but you need our help. This is bigger than anything you've done, you think they spun you on Collateral Murder, wait 'til you see what they do here. Tell Julian there's credit enough to go round, this is about survival.
139) 19) text: Where's Julian flying into?
140) 1) text: Julian walks out of customs. He ANXIOUSLY scrutinizes the men and women around him. From his PARANOID POV, they all seem suspect... they all seem to be STARING AT HIM...
140) 5) text: Julian.
140) 6) text: Julian spins, FREAKED. It's Birgitta.
140) 8) dialog: Did anyone follow you?

142) 1) text: Daniel, Birgitta and Julian talk in HUSHED TONES on the relatively empty train.
142) 3) dialog: We need to publish now.
142) 7) dialog: So we let the historians figure it out. Isn't that the point of this organization?
142) 10) text: The train stops, the doors open and Julian spots COPS walking on the platform. Panicked, he sees... the car's SURVEILLANCE CAM trained on them. Angry, scared, he glare at Daniel...
143) 1) text: Nick calmly peels an orange at a cafe overlooking the cit Birgitta, Daniel and Julian, hat PULLED LOW, sit across t table. ANXIOUS. And SKEPTICAL.
143) 5) dialog: Amazing how someone can talk for ten minutes without saying anything.
143) 10) dialog: (wary) What are you proposing?
143) 15) text: Julian considers, SWAYED. A beat, then --
143) 17) dialog: You'd want exclusives?
143) 21) dialog: And then what, we'd set a date? You'd run your stories, we'd post the raw data?
143) 29) dialog: You think that's necessary?
143) 33) dialog: I suppose it's just a name search.
143) 34) text: Julian seems SWAYED. Nick's phone RINGS.
143) 38) dialog: How secure are your phones?
143) 47) dialog: They'll take credit.
143) 52) text: This gets through. Julian jots something on a NAPKIN.
143) 54) dialog: This is a password for a temporary site. I'll e-mail the link in 24 hours, you'll find the war logs there.
143) 58) dialog: (nodding)  We'll put out the war logs in six weeks. If you behave, we'll move on to the cables.
143) 59) text: As Julian pushes the napkin across the table, we --

151) 12) text: Julian looks up, SURPRISED.
151) 14) dialog: What are you --
151) 18) dialog: I was... I was just sending you a list. Urls need to be standardized, torrents need seeding...

151) 23) dialog: That was on my list.
151) 26) text: Julian hesitates, then ABRUPTLY turns to Ziggy...

152) 1) text: Julian heads for the stairs.
152) 4) text: Julian turns, ENRAGED.
152) 6) dialog: Editing reflects bias. We make a promise to our sources, someone sent us those files under the assumption that we would put them out in full.
152) 11) dialog: Do you have any idea what we're about to do? 14 pages in the Guardian, 12 in the New York Times, it's more coverage than all the other leaks combined. I'm winning the information war and you're worried about a couple of names?
152) 15) dialog: They're government informants.
152) 19) dialog: You have no idea how the world works. How much Afghan blood do the Americans have on their hands?
152) 22) text: Julian pauses. Then turns cold.
152) 24) dialog: My bags, you know, they get heavy. Four laptops, all those cables... it's a lot for one person to carry around. And when you're on and off planes, always taking the computers out and packing them back up... it's a hassle. (then, sharp) So the next time you find yourself lecturing me about this organization, you should try to remember why I hired you.
152) 28) text: Julian turns on him. A tinge of sadness.
152) 30) dialog: It's amazing how you can spend so much time with someone and still have no concept of who they are. (then) You're suspended. Effective immediately.
152) 31) text: Julian exits with Ziggy. Off Daniel, STAGGERED...
161) 18) text: Nick frowns, glances back at Julian on CNN.
164) 12) text: Julian's phone BEEPS.
164) 29) text: Daniel frowns, opens up a chat box on his laptop. And TYP ddd: Julian? Are you there?

165) 2) text: Next to the chat, on the screen, STREAMING VIDEO CLIPS. P BACK TO REVEAL Julian typing a speech on another laptop. Katz walks in, eyes a bank of TV MONITORS nearby.

168) 1) text: Julian speaks to the press, enjoying his moment.
168) 3) dialog: ...an attempt to criticize the messenger, to distract from the power of the message...
168) 4) text: Julian hesitates, SOMEHOW SENSING SOMETHING AMISS. He loo to the audience... for Daniel? A bit disoriented... he presses forward, waving THE GUARDIAN FRONT PAGE.
168) 6) dialog: 
171) 1) text: A GLASS OF SCOTCH. REVEAL Sarah, NUMB, pouring a scotch, watching coverage of Julian's press avail. Boswell walks
171) 14) text: I watched an interview with him while I was packing up. He said something about pursuing social justice for the last twenty years, so I started thinking... 2 advanced degrees, a Fulbright, 3 diplomatic posts, 10 years abroad... and like everyone else in the building I can barely remember how old my kids are. (off Julian on TV) He wants to take over saving the world? Be my goddamn guest.
172) 1) text: A large green room, filled with supporters and a high end spread. Julian walks in, reporters on his heels.

174) 8) text: Julian paces alone, ENRAGED, in the shadow of the bonfire We CRANE UP as he paces, making FIGURE EIGHTS in the sand
175) 1) text: The cafe where Daniel and Julian took on Julius Baer. Dan stares at an empty table, and for a moment he sees...
175) 17) text: Daniel, you and Julian gave us a glimpse of what the future could be. You woke up the world, democracies and dictatorships alike should be on notice, two techno dreamers --
176) 1) text: Julian sits for an interview, talks straight to camera.
176) 3) dialog: We're not anti-American. Our values are those of Jefferson and Madison and if the cost of revolutions like we've seen in Tunisia, in Cairo, if the cost is that for a little while some foreign leaders are going to be a bit cautious when speaking to the U.S. State Department, then that is clearly a cost that bounces in favor of what people need.
