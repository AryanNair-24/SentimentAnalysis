Pressing it, the BACK WALL of the closet SLIDES OPEN, revealing a SECRET COMPARTMENT. On the wall is an old FRA PHOTO of EIGHT PEOPLE IN COSTUMES, from the 60s. Included this photo is a young Edward Blake--Blake wasn't a spook- was a superhero. WEAPONS of all kinds adorn the walls in here. TEAR-GAS, GRENADES, RIFLES, PISTOLS--if it can kill you Blake's got But that's not what draws Rorschach's attention. Hanging on the back wall, dead center, is a more current COSTUME. Black leather armor, gloves, boots. Hanging over all like a vacant, grinning face--a black leather MASK. Rorschach stares. Framed nearby is the FRONT PAGE OF THE BOSTON GLOBE. The headline reads "The Comedian Gets Last Laugh On Moloch." Underneath is a photo of Blake dressed the costume Rorschach was staring at--Blake was a superhe called the Comedian. In the photo, Blake holds a supervil named MOLOCH prisoner. (We'll meet Moloch later.) On the same page is a smaller photo of a group of superheroes. Rorschach is in the photo, as is Dr. Manhatt as is the Comedian. (As are DAN DREIBERG, ADRIAN VEIDT, a LAURIE JUPITER, all of whom we'll be meeting soon). The caption below reads: "The New Watchmen." Suddenly, Rorschach hears the front door open. He quickly closes the secret hatch.

Adrian sees Dan approaching, smiles wide. He holds up a finger, telling D to hold on a sec. Dan nods, takes a seat on the couch. Pi up a Fortune magazine with Adrian on the cover.

20) 5) dialog: Predicting stock prices isn't the same as predicting world events. I hope there isn't a war, or even a skirmish for that matter. Because Veidt Enterprises has some exciting plans, plans that will, pardon the cliche, truly make this world a better place. My team of engineers and scientists have been working with Dr. Manhattan himself on synthesizing a new, cheap form of energy which will eliminate the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with no toxic emissions.

Adrian turns up the volume, looking grim.

Its unnatural beauty almost hides a feral danger in its eyes. Adrian pets the beast.
160) 1) dialog: See this painting? Alexander the Great. Before his conquest of Phoenicia, he struck North for Gordium, where the world's greatest puzzle waited. A great knot, impossible to untie. For a young man determined to rule the world, it was a challenge he couldn't resist. So he sliced it in two with his sword. Lateral thinking, you see. Suddenly the Lynx stands, GROWLS.

Rorschach drops to the flo Adrian starts walking out of the hall. Dan helps Rorschac and they follow.
165) 14) dialog: I never intended to kill the Comedian-- that was an accident. Part of his duties as a government operative was to keep track of all former masked heroes, make sure there was no rocking of the boat. He must have liked Rorschach because he allowed him to continue to exist. I had thought that the Comedian might be incompetent, but he disproved that hypothesis when he discovered what was really going on. here in Karnak--no easy task. Even my staff was unaware--I made sure to keep each department separate. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
165) 21) dialog: The Comedian was appalled by my plan, but still, he understood the scope of what I was trying to accomplish. Frankly, I never thought he'd actually talk. But by the time he visited poor Moloch, he was cracking badly. So I had to kill him.

166) 17) dialog: I understand your disbelief, Dan. When I began the plan ten years ago, my moral safeguards gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice. See, the Comedian was correct. What we were doing with the Watchmen was pointless--the savage nature of humankind would inevitably lead to the end of the world. So in order to save the world, I had to trick it--to frighten the world towards salvation with history's greatest practical joke.
