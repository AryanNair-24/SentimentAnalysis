Pressing it, the BACK WALL of the closet SLIDES OPEN, revealing a SECRET COMPARTMENT. On the wall is an old FRA PHOTO of EIGHT PEOPLE IN COSTUMES, from the 60s. Included this photo is a young Edward Blake--Blake wasn't a spook- was a superhero. WEAPONS of all kinds adorn the walls in here. TEAR-GAS, GRENADES, RIFLES, PISTOLS--if it can kill you Blake's got But that's not what draws Rorschach's attention. Hanging on the back wall, dead center, is a more current COSTUME. Black leather armor, gloves, boots. Hanging over all like a vacant, grinning face--a black leather MASK. Rorschach stares. Framed nearby is the FRONT PAGE OF THE BOSTON GLOBE. The headline reads "The Comedian Gets Last Laugh On Moloch." Underneath is a photo of Blake dressed the costume Rorschach was staring at--Blake was a superhe called the Comedian. In the photo, Blake holds a supervil named MOLOCH prisoner. (We'll meet Moloch later.) On the same page is a smaller photo of a group of superheroes. Rorschach is in the photo, as is Dr. Manhatt as is the Comedian. (As are DAN DREIBERG, ADRIAN VEIDT, a LAURIE JUPITER, all of whom we'll be meeting soon). The caption below reads: "The New Watchmen." Suddenly, Rorschach hears the front door open. He quickly closes the secret hatch.

Over Moloch's shoulder Rorschach's hat-brim TILTS UP. As Moloch turns, Rorschach lunges, PINS Moloch's ARM behind back and SLAMS him to the floor.

51) 10) dialog: Oh God, please. I did my time. I'm not Moloch anymore. What do you want from me? Rorschach lets him go. Moloch's hollow eyes follow him.
