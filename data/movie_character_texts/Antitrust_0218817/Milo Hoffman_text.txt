Delbert swipes open the double doors, leans in: the hummi gets louder. ON MILO: pressing himself into the alcove. Delbert turns around, heads back down the hall... exits t building. Milo waits a beat before heading to the end of the hall.  Using the card, he enters

100) 0) text: Milo works the keyboard. Again, the code gets dense and  obscure as he goes deeper. He succeeds in calling-up a  graphical interface. Among the menus he can choose from a TARGET SCHOOLS, PD UPLOADS, RX UPLOADS. He clicks Target Schools, a menu shoots down (Berkeley, C Tech, etc.). He clicks Stanford, then Chin, Teddy. Two wi open. In one, there is a video stream of Teddy winning an award in the Gate's Bldg. In the other, uploaded police v stenciled SUNNYVALE PD) of the White Supremacists whose m shots we saw in the San Jose Mercury; they're being  interrogated. In the first window, Teddy's image dissolves into a handh crime-scene video (marked SV-PD) of a ransacked grocery s "DIE GOOK!" is painted on a wall. Milo looks confused: so "narrative" is unfolding, but it remains obscure without  audio. He types some more. In the bottom window, he brings up convoluted text regard the audio. About the only phrases we can understand are:  "Audio Block ON" and "Hardware Requirement: Magnetic Filt Type PBX-R17." His eyes cast about the room for some suitable hardware  substitute. He digs in his shirt pocket. He takes out his swipe card, studies it. He casts about some more, till he sees some kids' safety scissors in a jar.
102) 0) text: On-screen, long-lens footage shows a low building; the Ar Nations suspects come out of it. A still photo appears in the 2nd window: a steel hasp. Milo's eyes are narrowed: what am I seeing? Meantime, he reaching under the table where he has removed a plate fro the mainframe terminal, exposing hardware within. He has trimmed the swipe card to size and is wedging its  magnetic strip into a metal slot. He wiggles the card. We hear an eerie fibrillation, which flattens into the voice a serene, eminently sane female:

104) 0) text: Milo has tapped into his own file: footage of him lecturi at Stanford (as an RA), pointing to a whiteboard.
104) 2) text: The audio crackles and drops out again. Milo's eyes narro he sees video of Alice, sitting on a folding chair, speak to someone. She has a harder look, pulls on a Marlboro. What's he seeing? He wiggles the jerry-rigged hardware al urgently, till the narration crackles back on:
104) 6) text: The audio drops out as Milo sees uploaded medical files a ER photos of himself marked STANFORD MEDICAL CENTER: he's waxen, bloated, gasping for breath. With a certain dread, Milo jams the card in deeper:
104) 8) text: Milo is devastated, disbelieving. Now he sees real-time E footage: an Allergy Victim, bloated, twitching, gasping,  dying...
104) 10) text: The audio crackles out. But Milo doesn't have the heart t bring it back: he can fill in the rest.

115) 5) dialog: Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
115) 7) text: Milo enters as Barton finishes up with his colleague.
116) 0) text: Milo paces. He surveys framed diplomas, commendations and photos on the wall. He takes comfort in their solidity:  pictures of Barton's teenage Kids, Barton and Wife at the Grand Canyon. There's a college football photo, a young B with his team. Milo studies it, smiles. Move in on the ph till we see the number on Barton's Notre Dame football je ND 47. Milo's smile fades. It takes a moment before he even hear Barton behind him.
116) 2) dialog: Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.

118) 11) dialog: After I broke into 21 -- which was  insane, thank God they didn't catch  me! -- I just drove around. Trying  to figure out what possessed me. You  know what? I've been putting my own  guilt on Gary.
118) 13) dialog: (quietly) If I'd stayed down there, maybe this  wouldn't've happened.
118) 16) dialog: I thought, instead of indulging all  these paranoid delusions, risking my  job, alienating Gary, scaring you, I  should do something useful with my  grief. Help them find Teddy's killers.

120) 6) dialog: I snuck into #21.
120) 8) dialog: You thought about it too. You've  been suspicious for a while. But  it's not happening in there. It's  happening in the Day Care.
120) 11) dialog: Can we go someplace else?
121) 1) dialog: It's easy to know who the smart geeks  are, the schools tell 'em. They upload  medical files, school records,  pharmacy files. They'd be happy just  to steal code forever. But when a  program gets close to fruition. Like  Teddy. He was almost there.
121) 3) dialog: You know. There is no second place.  And what's the risk? The killings're   undetectable, they're hand-tailored,  they make "sense." I mean, they're  in the information business. They  have scenarios for all of us, too.  In case we find out too much.
121) 5) dialog: I'm not one of them. Not trying to  "suss you out."
121) 7) dialog: They killed my best friend! I'm living  with somebody they pay to go to bed  with me. Can't you trust somebody  just once? I don't wanna be alone  here.
121) 11) dialog: (forcefully) I know why you're so secretive. Why  you won't let anybody near you. (quieter) I know what he did to you.
121) 17) dialog: They'd frame him.
121) 19) dialog: (he nods) They're already watching you. If  they had to, they'd give him this  drug that mimics an alcoholic  blackout. He'd wake up not even  remembering his "act of revenge."
121) 23) dialog: Nobody's gonna hurt you.
121) 26) dialog: Hmm?
121) 28) dialog: No, no. Never.

Ostensibly, they have run into each oth on the way to work. They are smiling, casual. Only when we cut close do we see that their expressions b no connection to their words.
123) 2) dialog: They've got this guy in the DOJ,  maybe others. We tell the wrong  person, it's over.
123) 4) dialog: There's always a logical answer --  you just have to define the question.
123) 8) dialog: We don't tell anybody. (she's puzzled) We tell everybody. At once. So there's  no secret left to protect. When  everybody knows, they don't dare  touch us.

129) 3) dialog: I'm okay. It's going well!
129) 5) dialog: Sure.
129) 8) dialog: ...My dad was a compulsive gambler.  Only he didn't think he was. That  applied to guys who didn't have a  "system." "Losers," who played games  of chance. He could "read" people,  so chance had nothing to do with it.  No matter how deep a hole he dug  himself, he'd give you the whole  speech. And you'd better not point  out the obvious. (he shrugs) His creditors would catch up to him.  Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake  us in the middle of the night. Off  we'd go, again.
129) 10) text: Milo thinks: he's testing me.
129) 11) dialog: No. I just went deeper into the  machine. Preferred being the geek to  having to explain. Lying would've  been worse.
129) 13) dialog: Cause he was a liar. And I hated  him. (mimicking a voice) "Get your head out of that machine,  wise up to the real world." The more  he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause  if being savvy meant being like him -- (he shrugs) Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless,  even now. Didn't cultivate my  conniving side. 'Not sure I even  have one.

131) 3) dialog: Yeah, they dig stuff like this. (he types, then reads) "CBS News has partnered with Outpost  Information Systems in a cable news  network due to launch Fall of 2001."
131) 5) dialog: (he's shaking his  head) Say there's just one "mole" working  there, like Barton at the DOJ. How  do we know he's not the guy we've  contacted? Or she? Or the guy she  works for?
131) 8) dialog: (types, reads) Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake  in Gary's set-top device. That also  takes out CNN. (scrolling &amp; scrolling) "GE joins Outpost in new venture,"  which means NBC is out. "Disney joins  Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and  Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out.  Any of these places could have a  mole. Or all of 'em. (still scrolling) It's like a a continuous loop. We  can go to some alternative press  place that 1,000 people read, get  them and us killed. But anything big  enough for this is a parent of or a  subsidiary to something Gary's got a  finger in!
131) 10) dialog: Sorry.

132) 0) text: Milo and Lisa walk in the park outside the library, think it through.
132) 1) dialog: We can't just assume they're standing  by to receive Skywire 12 months from  launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
132) 3) dialog: It's how on-line services push logos  they wanna sell you. You don't ask  for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to  work on it somewhere besides my office  or my house. And then the quality of  the broadcast wouldn't exactly be  digital, that's 12 months away.
132) 5) dialog: You'd have to design a graphic  interface to make the data pop. Maybe  some audio, too. To tie it all in to  Gary. How long would that take you?
132) 7) dialog: Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We  have to do this fast.
132) 9) dialog: (a new wrinkle) Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's  house. To get the satellite positions.
132) 11) dialog: I don't know --

135) 4) dialog: I told Teddy about you.
135) 6) dialog: "A beautiful geek? What're the  chances?"
135) 8) dialog: I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so  much" to Alice. But even then I was  starting to wonder. Is it so great  to be so consumed by this one thing  that you let another person do your  thinking for you? If you have a  lucrative skill, it's all anybody  wants from you. You grow older but  you don't grow up. You turn into --  into --
135) 11) dialog: Larry used to say how the guys who  wrote the first cool operating  systems, like the UNIX guys at  Berkeley? They just gave it away.  They figured it was human knowledge,  it belonged to the world, like  Shakespeare or aspirin. 'Know what  I'm gonna do after we broadcast the  incriminating stuff? Air the Skywire  code. Then nobody can have a monopoly.

136) 10) dialog: Why doesn't he ask us to his party.  He's never even met you.
136) 12) dialog: It's for the Museum. He knows you're  a painter. If anybody should be  invited --
136) 14) dialog: I know you think I'm too attached to  him, but still. I am close to Gary.  And you're the most meaningful person  in my life. (he gets up) I'm going back to the Comix place,  why should I be killing myself.

141) 3) dialog: Thank God.
141) 5) dialog: (confused) They know I broke in. Alice helped  me. (figuring it out) Shrot's not one of them. He's  blundering into this on his own.
141) 7) dialog: Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty  part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't  bother with it, it's accessed by a  tunnel they boast about. You know  the best place to hide a leaf?

He stands in the center of the room making quarter turns. Through each of four (open) doorways he sees a perfectly- appointed "den," the ultimate expression of bland, rich,  professionally-decorated taste. He's lost. He starts into one room -- backs up -- goes into another.

And the wall fills up with the hellish Bosch trip After a moment, Milo senses something. Gary stands in the doorway. Watching him. Milo doesn't  breathe. Gary crosses the room, eyes locked with Milo's. Gary comes behind Milo. He reads the screen. It's filled  with text, whatever Milo loaded in when he sat down.
158) 2) dialog: I couldn't do it at work cause of  security or at home for -- obvious  reasons.

158) 8) dialog: Gary, I'm sorry if I was rude --
158) 12) dialog: Gary, I --
158) 14) text: He looks over. Milo looks over. Among the framed  commendations, awards, degrees we see Milo's childhood  program, written on Outpost 1.0. Gary has had it framed. Milo absorbs it. Even now, he feels something for Gary.
158) 16) dialog: I do know, Gary. I feel the same  way. I thought I was coming here for  a job. But it's meant a lot more.
158) 17) text: Milo smiles almost tenderly. He doesn't know if Gary buys it. Perhaps if he could see Gary's eyes. But they're obsc by Bosch's writhing bodies, reflected on his eyeglasses. Gary moves away from Milo, he stands over the table with art books, vaguely looks through one.
158) 19) text: Milo wonders: does he know? He picks his words carefully.
158) 20) dialog: I'm pretty close. But when I wrote  the last contact switches, it wiped  out a piece of the content filer.  You know what it's like, writing  software.

158) 24) text: Is this a confession? A plea for understanding? Or just a pep-talk to keep Milo focused on Skywire?

159) 2) dialog: I went to see the Skywire model in  Gary's office. You know. Just to  hold it again.
159) 6) dialog: No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody,  just now. To tell her how I feel  about you. (looks at her) You know I'm clueless, without you.  You know I --

162) 4) dialog: She called to apologize. I said I  was pulling an all-nighter. She said  then come home just to say Hi. Which  I always do when we fight, it's  suspicious if I don't.
162) 6) dialog: At this point the worst thing I could  do is anything out of the ordinary.
