0) 23) text: MONTAGE of magazine covers (Newsweek, Vanity Fair, WIRED) featuring Gary Boyd. They say, eg: "Who Owns Cyberspace?" a Time cover, he's composited by the Capitol Dome: "ROBBE BARON OR VISIONARY? Outpost's Antitrust Woes"
0) 25) text: GARY (early 40's) reads a statement before a Congressiona Sub-Committee. His voice is pleasant but firm:
0) 26) dialog: A kid working in his garage can create  the next Outpost, the new IBM. All  it takes is a great idea.
0) 28) dialog: That's why nobody can have a monopoly  in a business built on ideas.
6) 10) dialog: Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and  your friend can come up here. We've  made some amazing strides in digital  convergence. I'd love to show them  to you.
12) 4) text: Milo sits on a bench. He tries not to look, but his child hero is partly visible through a glass panel in the door: Gary (in a suit and tie) has an open American face. But  something goes on behind his pleasant features and self- possessed mien: his desire (or need) to solve the problem hand is so intense it makes him appear vexed -- even  vulnerable.
12) 10) dialog: Milo? Excuse the tie. I was on TV.
13) 1) dialog: The house knows the paintings I like,  it knows my favorite music. Same for  anybody else who's in the system.
13) 4) dialog: Would you like a Coke or something?
13) 7) dialog: When we started, I just hired my  smart friends. That was great. We  got a little bigger, I had to hire  smart strangers. Much harder.
13) 9) dialog: Now I don't get to hire anybody. But  I know you're the guy to write  Skywire.
14) 0) text: They enter. An entire wall is taken-up by a Bosch triptyc As Gary crosses to the other side of the room, Milo stand by a table covered in art books -- hundreds of them (Sout Chinoiserie, Roy Lichtenstein...)
14) 2) dialog: There's a rumor going around, maybe  you've heard it.
14) 3) text: Gary heads back, carrying something spherical.
14) 4) dialog: There's more to life than computers?  I'm looking into it.
14) 5) text: Glancing down at the daunting display of books, Gary look vaguely afflicted. He mutters:
14) 6) dialog: 'Once I start looking into something.
14) 8) dialog: I've only shown this to three other  people. I bought 200, we've launched  12 so far. I keep the coordinates in  this room. (as Milo takes it,  carefully) It's left over from SDI. Reagan's  Star Wars technology? They orbit 426  miles up.
14) 10) dialog: (he smiles: exactly) Among other things... We know  convergence is the real super-highway:  all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc.  linked together. Why cram it into a  cable if you can use the whole sky?
15) 0) text: Milo and Gary peer at a monitor, side-by-side. Milo sips own Snapple now. Gary speaks his language.
15) 1) dialog: The content filer has t'be written  into the media files so bits coming  off the satellite can be read by  multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms.  Including whatever new hardware  emerges.
15) 3) dialog: You'd have to start practically from  scratch. But this is all you'd be  working on. No marketing meetings,  no product seminars. We can't waste  the time. Half the Valley's working  on convergence. So're media  conglomerates, cable companies, phone  companies. 'Can't finish second,  Milo. There is no second... Now what  would you like to ask me?
16) 0) text: As they walk, Milo chides himself for his reticence. Gary seems to read his mind.
16) 1) dialog: I know what people say, and not just  the Justice Department. We clone  ideas, inflict our second-rate  versions on the world, we haven't  done anything original since 1.0.
16) 2) text: Milo's amazed by Gary's acuity. And his candor.
16) 3) dialog: Do I think that's fair? No. I'd put  some of our apps up against anybody's.  But is there some truth to it?
16) 4) text: They have come to a stop in a windowed entryway. Milo wat Gary keenly. Gary nods. He knits his brow.
16) 5) dialog: When you get to a certain age, you  start wondering. About your legacy.  I doubt you even remember Outpost  1.0 --
16) 7) dialog: (pleased) Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I  wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100  in cyber-years. I look at you and  see the things that got me here. (the furrows deepen) But somehow got away.
23) 2) text: Milo puts down his box, picks up the book: The Next Highw (Gary by a highway on its cover). As we look at it:
30) 2) text: Milo looks up. It's Gary. Milo is thrilled.
30) 4) dialog: Okay. I'm Gary.
30) 5) text: Milo's smile deepens. Gary notices the small painting (by Alice) hanging on the wall. He stares at it.
30) 6) dialog: 'Think I should buy some originals?
30) 8) dialog: Somebody said I'm just another  Philistine. With reproductions.
30) 10) dialog: That's what I told her. My wife.
30) 11) text: Milo colors as Gary drags a second chair in front of the  screen; didn't realize he was contradicting Mrs. Boyd.
30) 12) dialog: 'Thinks I'll be less of a control  freak if I have a hobby. 'Just gives  me something else to obsess about...
30) 13) text: Milo smiles as Gary sits down, studies the screen.
30) 14) dialog: Anything we can salvage from the old  code before you start fresh?
30) 15) text: Milo can't quite get over: Gary's his counselor.
31) 0) text: Two awe-struck Geeks see Gary through the window.
32) 3) dialog: Don't spend too much time searching.  You ever vetted somebody's old code  before? (when Milo shakes his  head) It's a different skill. Stay close  to the surface. The best-hidden  secrets are in plain sight. You know  the best place to hide a leaf, right? (when Milo shakes his  head) In a tree.
34) 0) text: Two DOJ AGENTS depose Gary. (A video-cam records his answ Two Outpost LAWYERS sit next to him. One of the Agents is reading from a document:
34) 2) text: Gary studies his copy of the E-mail. He looks vexed.
34) 3) dialog: I don't remember.
34) 5) dialog: I'm confused. Am I supposed to  speculate under oath?
34) 6) text: The Agent shifts in his seat. We get an idea of Gary's  negotiating skill (making the other party look unreasonab while offering nothing).
34) 8) dialog: ("confused" again) Didn't I? Have an answer? "I don't  remember."
34) 9) text: The Agents confer. Gary sees Phil, looming outside the op door. One of the Agents sees him, too. He doesn't try to  hide his annoyance:
35) 0) text: Gary takes a manila envelope from Phil, opens it.
35) 2) text: Gary reads the page from the envelope: computer code.
35) 3) dialog: This is good. Who did it?
35) 5) dialog: Maybe we should all get on it.
36) 0) text: Milo stares at his screen, frustrated. Gary enters.
36) 1) dialog: How's it going?
36) 3) dialog: (sharply; incredulous) Too fast? At least four companies're  on the verge of workable convergence  systems, Milo, they --
36) 4) text: Catching himself, Gary trails off. He sits down, exhales.
36) 5) dialog: Even when I had a hand in every aspect  of the company I knew the one thing  you can never control is somebody's  creative process.
36) 6) text: Gary seems sincerely contrite. (He needn't be: Milo just  wants to please him. Besides: Milo sees he'd like to stop obsessing about convergence, to be a "worldly zillionaire engrossed in his hobbies; but, after all, what could be m engrossing than Skywire?)
36) 8) dialog: (reaching into his  pocket) Take a look at this. Slightly  different approach.
36) 9) text: Reading the page Gary got from Phil, Milo knits his brow.
36) 11) dialog: You're making me young again.
40) 0) text: Gary's SECRETARY types as Milo enters. She smiles at him.
41) 0) text: Gary's face is red. The two Lawyers who sat in on his  deposition are with him again.
41) 2) dialog: I'm confused, Ted.
41) 3) text: Gary has used the phrase before, but the pretense of  ingenuousness is gone; it's witheringly condescending.
41) 4) dialog: Didn't you tell me they'd be Chapter  12 by the time they could hope to  enjoin? I'm very confused, because  you said they'd be ready to settle.
42) 0) text: Agitated, Gary rather compulsively lines-up the papers, p etc. on his desk; he barely hears the knock at the open  doorframe.
42) 1) dialog: Milo. What's up?
42) 3) dialog: Right... Right.
42) 6) dialog: (dark, unsmiling) What're you implying.
42) 8) text: Their eyes are locked. Gary blinks, sags into his chair.
42) 9) dialog: Everything I do is under scrutiny.  The questions they ask, trying to  make anything strategic look sordid. (knits his brow) I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in  business try to get ahead?
42) 11) dialog: The purpose of this company isn't to  destroy our competitors any more  than the purpose of living is to  breath. But the software business is  binary: you're a zero or a one. Being  obsessive isn't a crime. It's a  character trait.
42) 12) text: Milo just wants to get out. He studies the code to hide h discomfort. Gary watches him.
42) 13) dialog: It scales, don't you think?
48) 1) dialog: What'd the girl say?
49) 0) text: Gary turns back inside, where Phil reads Milo's new code.
49) 2) dialog: Nothing does. Still. I want him to  like me.
49) 3) text: Phil is confused by Gary's sincerity; so is Gary.
50) 0) text: Desi and another Geek watch in astonishment: Gary walks M to his car, his arm circled over Milo's shoulder. He seem to be -- apologizing. EXT./INT. MILO &amp; ALICE'S HOUSE - EVENING Milo comes eagerly up the path: can't wait to tell Alice  what just happened. He enters -- pulls up short. Alice is waiting for him. She's white.
58) 0) text: Milo types. There is a rapping on the doorframe. Gary.
58) 1) dialog: I heard what happened.
58) 3) text: Gary nods. Spontaneously Milo stands, hugs Gary.
58) 4) dialog: Had you talked to him much lately?
58) 6) dialog: Did you?
58) 8) dialog: I meant did you find other stuff to --
58) 10) dialog: You've been coming in early.
59) 0) text: Milo eats alone. Through the window, he sees Lisa inside. She's eating alone, too. Gary comes trotting up.
59) 1) dialog: Milo?
59) 4) dialog: 34,000. But they're real short lines.  'Just came out that way.
59) 5) text: Seeing Gary's code, Milo knits his brow: it must be sort like -- Teddy's.
59) 6) dialog: Been thinking about the push mechanism  in the handler. And it came over me:  it's in the wrong place.
59) 8) dialog: The answer's not in the box. It's in  the band.
59) 9) text: Milo's smile freezes. As he stares at Gary, we zoom with reverse dolly so that the background retreats queasily bu Gary remains dominant in frame. For Milo, it feels like t very ground is going out from under him. Gary continues to explain, pointing at lines of code. And Milo pretends to listen. But he can't even make out the w Gary speaks -- he hears only a jumble of echoes. Milo nods mechanically; he wants to scream. Or run. He  perceives, amid the echoes, that Gary is standing, smilin saying "See you later." And he's gone. Milo touches the pages, like some talisman of Teddy.
81) 0) text: Gary, Randy &amp; Phil approach Shrot; Gary stares at him
81) 5) text: Gary explodes, with incredulity.
81) 6) dialog: Milo? Try to have a clue. Try to  think.
81) 7) text: Gary strides off. Shrot feels unfairly maligned.
122) 2) text: She's at Gary's house. On the hot seat. Phil and Randy wa her. Gary does, too, but deep in shadow, behind a desk, a remove. Rain falls heavily on the Lake.
122) 6) text: Phil looks convinced. Gary doesn't.
129) 0) text: Milo watches new Skywire code emerge from his printer. Gary is in the doorway behind him: watching Milo, scrutin izing him. Sensing someone, Milo turns and looks.
129) 2) dialog: You look a little tired.
129) 4) dialog: 'Have a look?
129) 6) text: Gary takes the page. As he reads it over:
129) 7) dialog: Why did you move around so much?  When you were a kid.
129) 9) dialog: What would you tell the kids? At  your new school? You had to come up  with a good story, right?
129) 12) dialog: ...Worse?
129) 14) dialog: Don't be so hard on yourself. With a  brain like yours, you could connive  with the best of 'em I bet.
129) 15) text: Gary smiles. There's no way to read it.
136) 5) text: INT. MILO &amp; ALICE'S HOUSE - MORNING Morning TV is on in the kitchen. A Seattle station airs a puff piece about a party at Gary's house: people in forma clothes (including Gary &amp; his Wife) hold drinks and e canapГ©s on the terrace over Lake Washington. (Gary's hai is different: it's file footage.)
142) 0) text: A busy lunch hour. Milo is eating with some other Program including Desi. There's a stir of excitement in the room. Gary comes straight to Milo's table; all conversation  instantly drops out.
142) 1) dialog: Milo?
142) 2) text: Milo stands. Gary hands him a heavy vellum invitation.
142) 3) dialog: I'm giving a benefit for the art  museum Thursday night. Thought you'd  like to bring Alice.
142) 6) dialog: (as he goes) 'Sorry about the late notice...
144) 2) text: He nods. [It's not necessary for us to understand what sh saying, just so Milo does.] She holds up an audio copy of Gary's book, The Next Highway.
146) 2) text: Alice smiles, Milo forces a smile: it'll be even harder t sneak away, now. They pass a doorway where a Houseman stands, to keep gues from entering residential rooms (the ones Milo must pass  through to get to Gary's workroom). A Guy in a pretentiou hip tux tries to peek in.
146) 6) dialog: Alice, I'm Gary. This is my wife,  Clarissa. (handshakes, etc.) Milo, this is Barry Linder, who's  visiting from Hollywood.
146) 11) dialog: Barry's studio's gonna help fill the  Skywire pipeline, thought you guys  should meet.
146) 19) text: ANGLE: Milo, Alice, Gary, Barry Linder, Clarissa, Ricky.  Milo looks utterly preoccupied...
146) 23) text: Gary smiles as everyone toasts him, except Milo; he hasn' heard any of it.
147) 0) text: Gary chats with his guests. Alice looks up at the digital art, now a Bosch again.
152) 0) text: The first Houseman moves through the Guests, toward Gary.
153) 0) text: Milo has finally made it. Sitting at Gary's work station, slips a CD-ROM into the PC. It floods with text. The musi echoes from far off. The entire wall behind him is filled with a Mondrian.
154) 0) text: As Linder chats, the first Houseman sidles up to Gary,  whispers in his ear. We see Gary smile, excuse himself. H and Alice share a look as he moves off. We go with Gary. His smiles fades instantly. He pushes th Guests, who thank him for hosting such a brilliant "do;" hardly hears them.
157) 0) text: Unlike the Housemen, Gary doesn't follow the paintings. H moves swiftly, seems to know where Milo is.
158) 0) text: Milo clicks, closing the window. Concentrating, he doesn' see what we see on the wall behind him: the Mondrian drai away... And the wall fills up with the hellish Bosch trip After a moment, Milo senses something. Gary stands in the doorway. Watching him. Milo doesn't  breathe. Gary crosses the room, eyes locked with Milo's. Gary comes behind Milo. He reads the screen. It's filled  with text, whatever Milo loaded in when he sat down.
158) 1) dialog: (reading the screen) "Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working  with you. I'd be lying if I didn't  say I find you attractive. But in my  heart I know that Alice..." (he looks up) You left my party to send E-mail?
158) 3) text: Gary stares at Milo. He looks skeptical. The party music  floats in from afar as the moment stretches.
158) 4) dialog: You could've handwritten it.
158) 6) dialog: Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
158) 11) dialog: No problem. (when he's gone) Is there?
158) 13) dialog: You see what's hanging on the wall?
158) 14) text: He looks over. Milo looks over. Among the framed  commendations, awards, degrees we see Milo's childhood  program, written on Outpost 1.0. Gary has had it framed. Milo absorbs it. Even now, he feels something for Gary.
158) 15) dialog: I hope you know what you mean to me.  Not just because of what you're doing.  Because of who you are.
158) 17) text: Milo smiles almost tenderly. He doesn't know if Gary buys it. Perhaps if he could see Gary's eyes. But they're obsc by Bosch's writhing bodies, reflected on his eyeglasses. Gary moves away from Milo, he stands over the table with art books, vaguely looks through one.
158) 18) dialog: When will you have a Beta version?
158) 21) dialog: I do know. You focus on the big  problem. But somewhere down the chain,  something breaks down. Something  gets destroyed. At first it's  upsetting. You feel you've lost  control.
158) 22) text: Gary puts down the book. Something in his tone draws Milo
158) 23) dialog: So you have to remind yourself: it's  just the process. Something's always  lost along the way to anything  worthwhile. Some little bug, some  glitch. 'Can't get bogged down in  that, you're doing something other  people could never do. They lack the  imagination, the brain, the nerve.  Let them fret about every unforeseen  consequence. You have to solve the  problem. That's who you are.
159) 5) text: He'd better have his story straight with Gary and Alice.
169) 0) text: Milo smiles at Desi as he moves up the hall. He almost bu into Gary's Secretary.
174) 0) text: Len is at the console. On a security monitor, he has call up video from a moment ago: Milo hurrying up the hall, al running into Gary's Secretary. Shrot has an eye on the video as he speaks on the phone.
191) 2) text: Gary's eyes narrow.
197) 0) text: Gary is pacing...
201) 2) text: Phil sags gratefully into a chair... only to see Gary plo past him. At his workstation Gary types, mutters:
201) 3) dialog: That's what he was doing in here.
201) 6) text: Gary throws a printed spiral notebook at him.
201) 7) dialog: Help me change the Skywire settings.  Add five degrees to each satellite  coordinate.
201) 9) dialog: Just do what I'm asking!
201) 10) text: Gary hits a switch. A wood panel slides into the wall,  revealing a bank of four TV's.
204) 0) text: Phil reads to Gary as he types.
207) 1) dialog: Okay, #2.
210) 0) text: Gary hits enter.
215) 2) dialog: Let's go.
215) 4) dialog: Wait... He knows.
215) 6) dialog: 'Knows I'm altering the coordinates.  Let's jump to #12.
215) 8) dialog: Just do it.
222) 0) text: Gary and Phil watch as the Skywire logo gets steadily str on Gary's TV's. Phil is confounded:
224) 11) text: 3. The cuts accelerate. In a NETWORK CONTROL ROOM, Techni flip switches, trying to bring back scheduled programming At the NIKKEI, the Brokers are transfixed by what comes o the Big Board. In a VEGAS CASINO Gamblers sip their drink as they watch it on closed-circuit horserace monitors. On STREET CORNER, a Crack Dealer watches on his beeper. At a STADIUM, the Stones play but (tilting up) the Diamond Vis behind them plays Milo's broadcast. In an ELECTRONICS STO a wall of TV's -- 200 of them -- plays grisly primer foot for Shoppers. A guy takes a shiny wrapped copy of Outpost '98 from his basket, returns it to the shelf... In the Da Care Computer Room, it plays on all the monitors as Randy moves through the room with a big buzzing electro-magneti hoop, which he runs over each tower, wiping out data. Through all the cuts, we hear Gary's narration:
228) 0) text: Open on Gary's TV monitors, then pan into the room. Phil departed; the Outpost Lawyers have taken his place.
228) 2) dialog: Cop a plea? I'm confused, Ted. You  think I knew about this?
228) 4) dialog: I'm running the company, fighting  the DOJ, raising a family. Randy and  Phil obviously overreacted. To this  endless, antitrust witchhunt.
228) 7) dialog: That won't be a problem.
229) 1) dialog: As for PR, Skywire'll take care of  all that.
230) 1) dialog: The world's seen it now. They know  it's gonna dominate the convergence  market even beyond how Outpost '98  dominates the desktop.
231) 1) dialog: Go after us, you give foreign  competitors a shot at the platform  that'll hold sway for 30 years: you  threaten not just our chip and PC  partners like when you came after  the browser.
232) 1) dialog: You threaten TV networks, phone  companies, catalog outlets, publishing  houses, movie studios, travel agents,  airlines, stock brokerages -- you  sabotage the whole economy. Talk  about undermining innovation!
232) 3) text: He hands the pad to Gary.
234) 0) text: Gary is reading from the Lawyer's pad.
234) 1) dialog: "I had no knowledge of these  activities, but I have to ask myself  if the competitive environment I  encouraged in some small way  contributed --"
234) 3) text: Gary looks up. The Lawyer nods soberly at the TV's. In one window, the Skywire code scrolls slowly past. In t other, it says: "Here's the code for the operating system that made this braodcast possible. Take it. Use it. Make new convergence technologies as free as the Web." Under the windows, these words scroll continuously: HUMAN KNOWLEDGE BELONGS TO THE WORLD. Watching, Gary knits his brow: he looks wounded.
