Long-robed waiters are padding in and out from the kitchens, quietly and efficiently serving food. There are no Arab women to be seen. The air has a smoky quality, and the room is filled with the murmur of voices and the clink of dishes. Perhaps soft music of an oriental nature is heard in the background. The light is supplied principally from candles. As the CAMERA completes its sweep around and COMES TO REST on the entrance, we see Ben and Jo arriving.
