2) 22) text: INT. HOLCOMB’S OFFICE - DAY DR. HOLCOMB is tall and ultra-confident with a runner's physique and shoulder-length hair. He examines Edward's brain scan on a light board.
2) 23) dialog: Luckily the tumors appear relegated to the surface of the brain. Shouldn’t be to difficult to--
2) 25) dialog: Stop talking.
2) 27) dialog: This isn’t a skinned knee. I can’t fix it with a band-aid and a lollypop. Choriocarcinoma travels through your bloodstream which means it’s everywhere and it has almost finished killing you. They stare each other down. Egos facing off... Finally, Edward stands...
2) 29) dialog: You don’t have that kind of time.
4) 0) text: Edward's bald cranium has been clamped into a large, steel halo. A laser marks a point on his forehead and Dr. Holcomb marks corresponding dots on his skin with a Sharpie.
4) 1) dialog: I’m going to ask you to remember something for me. Edward is staring with disgust at his reflection in a glass window.
4) 3) dialog: The young lion waits in a dream beneath the cold white lantern. 15.
4) 5) dialog: The young lion waits in a dream beneath the cold white lantern. Repeat it back to me.
4) 7) dialog: Doesn't mean anything. It’s a memory test. Any time we go near the brain... there’s always a risk. This is how we’ll know if you’ve gone vegetable on us.... Again.
7) 3) dialog: So, it couldn’t have gone better. We got in, got out and the tumor came back benign. All that remains now is to make sure you’re not mentally-- 19.
7) 5) dialog: Surliness is a good sign. How’s the catheter feel? He checks the integrity of the bulging plastic drain implanted into the center of Edward’s sternum.
7) 7) dialog: (barely listening as he scribbles on the chart) Wonderful. Okay, we saved your brain, now we're going to kill your body. Your markers are through the roof so I'd like to begin the first course of chemo in the morning. Good?
7) 10) dialog: I'm sorry. I’m running late. Walks out.
16) 3) dialog: We're not giving up. There are some experimental programs we’re conducting and I think you'd be an excellent--
16) 5) dialog: --candidate. It’s cutting edge medicine. The odds are against you, but-
16) 7) dialog: Yes?
16) 9) dialog: Oh. Sorry. Holcomb steps to the side of the television. Stares for a beat... DR. HOLCOMB (CONT’D) Well, if you have any questions. 33. Waits another beat then starts for the door.
16) 11) dialog: Of course.
16) 15) dialog: I'm sorry, I’m not Mister Carter’s--
16) 17) dialog: I'm sorry, Mister Carter. According to this your markers haven't stabilized. Carter takes it in, though it’s the answer he expected.
16) 19) dialog: Several months. A year if you’re lucky. As I was just telling Edward, we have an experimental program which has had some very positive--
16) 21) dialog: I’m truly sorry. 34. Carter just nods and replaces the headphones over his ears as Holcomb makes his exit.
79) 1) dialog: (walking after him) Edward.
79) 3) dialog: It came out of nowhere but it’s his brain and the tumors are deep.
79) 5) dialog: Day after tomorrow.
79) 7) dialog: In his condition it’s not-- The odds aren’t what we’d like them to be. Edward sees there’s little hope. Resumes walking into--
80) 20) dialog: Well, technically yes, but--
81) 2) dialog: I cannot allow you to sneak him out again. I could be personally liable-- As Edward slams him into the wall.
91) 1) dialog: We're ready. Carter reaches out for Virginia’s hand and presses it to his heart.
