0) 2) dialog: Tesla took his design to the richest man in town, mister J.P. Morgan.
0) 4) dialog: That’s right. Morgan was the major financier for Tesla’s primary rival, a fellow by the name of Tom Edison.
0) 6) dialog: Between them, Morgan and Edison controlled the entire power grid for New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and so on.
0) 8) dialog: They had “serious jing.” Which is why, when Tesla walked into Mr. Morgan's office and unveiled an invention designed to provide free, wireless electricity to the entire population of the planet - remember now, this is 1912 - Mister Morgan had no choice but to finance it immediately.
0) 10) dialog: Without hesitation.
0) 12) dialog: Invariably.
0) 14) dialog: A year later, Tesla invited Mr. Morgan out to Long Island, where he had nearly completed the first in a series of towers which would tap into the Earth and beam its energy through the air to a nearby receiver.
0) 18) dialog: Machiavellian? I agree.
0) 20) dialog: He became a pariah. No one dared cross Morgan. Nikola Tesla lived the rest of his life in isolation and died in poverty. The proverbial tree that falls without a sound.
0) 22) dialog: Most true stories are. Happy endings are for suckers. Carter lights a new cigarette as he answers the phone...
0) 23) dialog: This is Carter... Hey, how was the interview?... Oh... Well, there’s plenty of fish in the... Dr. Young? (MORE)
0) 25) dialog: That’s not possible. He removes the butt from between his lips as smoke dribbles from his mouth. He looks at the cigarette for a moment then drops it to the floor. ANGLE ON the cigarette butt, slowly burning itself out. In the b.g., Manny pulls himself out from under the car, staring up at Carter.
0) 26) dialog: Today? That’s no good, the team’s got their first scrimmage before... Yeah... No, I know. Okay... Yep. Okay.
0) 28) dialog: (hanging up the phone) Ah, it’s nothing, it’s just... He steps on the cigarette as he walks in a daze past Manny and out the door of the garage into the blinding day which fills the frame with its white light...
2) 0) text: Thomas barrels in, passing a curtained off area near the door, and drops the bags onto the empty bed next to the window. Opening the first suitcase, he sets up the room with practiced efficiency-- He plugs in a cell phone cradle and sets it on the bedside table along with a hi-tech alarm clock... Lines half a dozen shoes and slippers down the length of the bed... Unloads a stack of thick books on living with cancer, cancer treatment, cancer nutrition, new cancer protocols... Sets a laptop computer on the table, surrounding it neatly with pens, notepads and Post-Its... Places a massive, Royal Classic copper coffee siphon on the window sill, along with copper-lined cups and saucers and spoons and a dark wooden box covered in Arabic writing and Sumatran customs stickers... VOICES are heard in the hallway - a commotion coming closer. Thomas quickly removes a vase and flowers. He jogs through the separator curtain and into the bathroom where he fills the vase with water, completely missing the figure lying in the bed behind the curtain. 10. The noise in the hallway is reaching a fever pitch as Thomas emerges from the bathroom and nearly loses the vase as he sees Carter lying in the near bed.
2) 1) dialog: (eying the flowers) You shouldn’t have. He’s thin and drawn and hooked up to a network of tubes and even his eyelashes have fallen out exposing his sallow skin that’s dappled with angry chemo burns. There are flowers everywhere and the wall behind him is a collage of get well cards and photos of a girls soccer team.
2) 3) dialog: You know, fighting for my life... You? Just as the hallway brigade bursts into the room - seen in silhouette and through the gap in the curtains - as doctors and nurses and handlers hover over--
2) 18) dialog: Who the hell are you?
2) 20) dialog: That was the first I laid eyes on him. An inauspicious beginning to be sure, but most stories begin that way... It got worse before it got better.
3) 6) dialog: (without looking up) Who the hell is Mister Cole?
3) 8) dialog: (dismissive) Mmmm.
3) 14) dialog: No offense...
4) 9) dialog: Testicular cancer is almost unheard of for anyone over thirty, but then Edward always despised conformity.
5) 1) dialog: By the morning of the surgery it had spread so far throughout his body that the doctors gave him a five percent chance to live...but then they didn’t account for how pissed off they’d made him. PUSH INTO Edward’s inert face which, even under sedation, appears annoyed at the intrusion...
6) 14) dialog: Nah, I’m good all the way up to Stalin. Lays his hand on an impressive stack of books atop his bedside table, all concerning early 20th century Russia.
6) 15) dialog: Oh, Todd Phillips called. He was asking about the--
6) 18) dialog: That's right... Watch out for their front line, and their sweeper likes to take the ball up the field.
6) 20) dialog: You ladies are much better off without me. Coach Sanders knows ten times more about the game as I do.
6) 22) dialog: What is a blackberry?... What are lingonberries?... Who is Halle Berry?...
7) 0) text: Edward opens his eyes to see the television is turned on to Jeopardy. Carter is sitting up in bed, firing the answers back at the screen.
7) 2) dialog: Huh? Oh. (lowers the volume) Doc wanted you to wake up, said I shouldn’t pussyfoot. Just as Dr. Holcomb enters like a zephyr.
7) 9) dialog: Say, Doc. Do you think you could-
7) 11) dialog: (to Edward) Real Mother Theresa, that one. Edward tries to sit up but is held in place by the web of tubes running in and out of his body.
7) 12) dialog: I wouldn’t do that if I were you.
7) 15) dialog: What is the quadratic equation! (to Edward) Huh? Oh, in and out for the last few months.
7) 17) dialog: Which part?
7) 19) dialog: They say it’s different for everyone. Once you get used to the ‘round the clock vomiting and watching your veins turn black and the feeling that your bones are made of napalm, it’s not bad at all.
7) 21) dialog: Say, I been meaning to ask you, what the hell is that contraption over there? Points over to the high-tech coffee maker.
7) 23) dialog: I figured that much. What else it do?
7) 25) dialog: I‘1ll be damned... Did you know that coffee was originally discovered by a shepherd in Ethiopia? Edward just stares at him... Carter continues, as much for his own pleasure as for Edward's edification...
7) 26) dialog: His goats had been eating the cherries of an unfamiliar bush and soon became unmanageable, running and jumping all over creation. The shepherd chewed some of the leaves which gave him a strange vitality so he took some branches to the local monastery where the abbot decided to roast them. When the cherries started to burn, the beans inside produced such a pleasant aroma that they brewed them into a stew which eventually spread to Columbia, Asia, even Sumatra, like that hooch you got over there.
7) 28) dialog: I know what it is.
7) 30) dialog: (makes a face) Not even if I was dying of thirst in the Gobi desert.
7) 32) dialog: I’m more of an instant coffee man. Edward's I.V. tubes have become tangled in the call button. Carter rolls his eyes, but eases himself creakily out of bed and shuffles over to untangle them expertly.
7) 34) dialog: Twenty-six years. Used to work in this ward. 22.
7) 36) dialog: In a manner of speaking. Hands Edward the call button and shuffles back to his bed.
7) 38) dialog: You fired her, when this became “your” hospital.
8) 4) dialog: You sure you want to eat all that? He’s watching them through thin eyes as he works his way through his own I.V.
8) 7) dialog: Carter.
8) 9) dialog: Pass.
8) 11) dialog: Good enough to taste it twice? Thomas puts the plate in front of Edward who picks up a piece of fried artichoke...
8) 13) dialog: Revenge for what? Edward pops the artichoke in his mouth, grinning as he chews.
9) 0) text: As his sumptuous dinner hits the floor with the force of a hurricane. He’s moaning and spitting as he climbs out of bed and makes for the bathroom but his I.V. tubes jerk him back and he ends up on the floor where he unleashes another torrent. After a moment, he looks up to see Carter watching him evenly.
9) 2) dialog: You are. Winces as Edward vomits again.
10) 0) text: Edward is in bed and covered in sweat as he shivers uncontrollably. His eyebrows are gone and the first chemo burn blooms above his right eye. Carter is curled up in his own bed as he turns the last page of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin: A Poem by Mayakovsky then places it atop a stack of completed books on the floor.
11) 0) text: Carter stares up at the collage of photos and cards taped to the wall above his head. He removes a photograph of his daughter's soccer team. He’s seen standing proudly in the back row wearing a coach’s hat and a whistle around his neck. Edward groans in his sleep and wrestles with his sheets. The bandages have been removed from his head, which is now scarred and littered with uneven patches of stubble. Carter looks over at him until he settles.
12) 0) text: A new stack of books relating to The Civil War towers atop Carter’s bedside table as Nurse Shing removes an empty I.V. bottle from the stand.
12) 1) dialog: So, that’s the end of it?
12) 3) dialog: How long? 25.
12) 5) dialog: Thanks Phyllis. She heads out as he checks his watch.
12) 6) dialog: Mind if I turn this on? Edward is sitting up in bed, haggard but lucid as he types angrily on his laptop, sipping a cup of coffee. He waves his hand dismissively. Carter turns the television on to Jeopardy and becomes immediately engrossed...
12) 7) dialog: What is The Great Divide?... What is somnambulism?... Who was Warren Harding?...
12) 8) text: Edward pauses in his typing. Glances over at Carter...
12) 10) dialog: (shrugs modestly) I missed one last week. Edward studies him for a moment before turning back to his computer.
14) 0) text: Rachel sits on Carter’s bed. He’s elated at the news. 26.
14) 1) dialog: So who you playing in the championships?
14) 3) dialog: Oh.
14) 5) dialog: I’‘ll have to do some homework on ‘em. Edward shuffles out of the bathroom.
14) 20) dialog: ‘Gin-
15) 0) text: The copper coffee maker reflects a single light source in the otherwise darkened room. Edward stares at the machine from his bed, eyes lost in the gleaming metal. The reflection shifts and Edward rolls over to see Carter adjusting his reading light.
15) 2) dialog: Book on Robert Smalls.
15) 4) dialog: He was a conscripted slave aboard a Confederate steamship, The Planter. One night he and some of the crew smuggled their families aboard and stole it right out from under the rebels’ noses. He turned it over to the Union Navy who made him a captain. By the end of the war he’d risen to the rank of General and later became the second African-American to serve in Congress.
15) 6) dialog: (agreeing) Quite a life.
15) 8) dialog: You're joking.
15) 10) dialog: How’s that coming along? Make any yet?
15) 12) dialog: (dubious ) All your dreams fulfilled?
15) 14) dialog: Not exactly. We were practically kids ourselves when my first boy came alone. Young, broke and black, you take the first job they offer you. Thirty years goes by in a heartbeat.
15) 16) dialog: I love my children, if that’s what you mean.
15) 18) dialog: I made this in high school. Creative writing class. Some kind of exercise to get us to think about something besides chasing skirts. He slips out of bed and hands it across to Edward. 30.
15) 20) dialog: Hasn’t improved, I assure you.
15) 22) dialog: I was trying to be funny, I guess. It’s a list of things to do before I kick the bucket.
15) 24) dialog: I didn’t say it was realistic.
15) 26) dialog: (shrugs ) I was sixteen.
15) 28) dialog: (without looking) “Listen to the mountain and be heard.” That’s from my uncle. Second World War his squadron flew supplies through the Himalayas into China. Called them the Hump Pilots... Most non-combat casualties of any unit in Air Force history... You can honestly say you’ve accomplished everything you ever dreamed about?
15) 32) dialog: Money ain’t everything.
15) 34) dialog: What about your wife?
15) 36) dialog: There’s got to be something you haven’t done.
15) 38) dialog: (after a beat) Suit yourself. He gets back into bed and slips the list between the pages of his book. Edward watches him for a moment, then turns back to staring at the coffee maker.
16) 0) text: Carter hides behind the sports section of a local newspaper, highlighting pieces of an article on the Essex girls soccer team.
16) 13) dialog: Yeah?
16) 18) dialog: How long?
16) 20) dialog: Sure, Doc. Whatever you think.
16) 22) dialog: There was a survey once, a hundred people were asked, if they could, would they want to know in advance the day of their death. Out of the hundred, ninety-six of them said no. Carter closes his eyes as the music washes over him. CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D) I never understood that. I always thought it would be liberating, knowing exactly how much time you had left to work with. A tear escapes onto his cheek and he looks over at Edward who is staring back at him over his shoulder. CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D) So now I knew. Neither says a word and Edward finally turns back to the game. FADE OUT.
17) 0) text: CLOSE ON CARTER; fast asleep. A square of sunlight moves across his eyes until he opens them and squints into the white light. He rolls over, away from the window and face to-face with a single sheet of yellowed paper propped up against his tower of books. He pulls the paper close to his eyes and sees the title: “EDWARD'S BUCKET LIST.”
17) 1) dialog: I‘ll be damned. Just as Edward bustles out of the bathroom, arms filled with toiletries.
17) 3) dialog: ‘Time is it? Edward dumps the toiletries in his half-packed suitcase. 35.
17) 5) dialog: (re: the paper) So I see.
17) 7) dialog: (reading) A hot dog eating contest? “Kiss the most beautiful woman in the world?” How you figure on doing that?
17) 9) dialog: Don’t take this the wrong way, but these are a little...shallow?
17) 11) dialog: None, actually... I think you misunderstood-
17) 16) dialog: What did you-- You had no right--
17) 21) dialog: You don’t seriously think-- I was being metaphorical, you know, taking stock, trying to understand something about--

18) 0) text: Empty save for a slow-moving nurse or two until Edward bursts out of the room with a full head of steam followed by Thomas, once again laden with luggage, and Carter who carries a small bag and an armful of books. Edward makes for the elevators as Carter struggles to catch up to him.
18) 1) dialog: What about my family?

19) 14) dialog: No.
19) 16) dialog: I want to go back... I’m serious, have your man-- Where is he? (looking around) Have him take me back to the hospital.
19) 18) dialog: (grabbing him) No you forget it. This isn’t rational.
19) 20) dialog: No! Edward starts unbuttoning his shirt.
20) 0) text: As the Yankee outfielders jog out to their positions. The crowd suddenly ROARS as the left fielder passes a naked man who is jogging and waving across the grass. Carter holds Edward's clothes, staring in disbelief as Edward takes a victory lap towards right field.
20) 1) dialog: Oh lord. 41. Stadium security guards hustle out after Edward, forcing him to veer towards deep center field. The crowd boos, as it appears they have him trapped, until he throws a fake on one of his pursuers who trips in the grass much to the crowd's delight. Edward's headed back into left but the NYPD has joined the chase and they’re closing in fast. Edward tries another fake, but he’s tackled by a burly police officer who brings him to the ground. A second officer helps bring Edward’s arms behind his back when something suddenly knocks him off his feet and into his fellow officer. INT.

24) 0) text: Virginia wipes tears from her face as she walks resolutely to her car. Carter follows her, watching Edward as Thomas helps him to the limo.
24) 2) dialog: I can't. She opens the driver’s side door. Carter stops on the passenger's side.
24) 4) dialog: Gin’, you don’t understand. He sees Edward waiting at the limo door, watching Carter.
24) 7) dialog: Given up?! I’ve spent my life giving up everything to this family. Thirty years greased up under the hood of a car to see that they didn’t want for nothing! And they didn’t, ‘Gin... I gave up every last one of my ambitions and I wouldn’t take any of it back, but if I am gonna die, I'd like to go out with some idea of who I could have been...of who I am.
24) 9) dialog: I know it. I just wish I knew what that meant anymore... He turns and walks over to the limo. He takes a last look at his incredulous wife then climbs inside.
26) 0) text: CLOSE ON CARTER; wearing a helmet and struggling with the top of a child-proof prescription pill bottle.
26) 2) dialog: No, I got it... (to no avail) Dammit! Throws the bottle to the floor. It rolls towards the cockpit where Edward is seen from the back, talking with the pilots.
26) 3) dialog: (about all of it) Fool... So foolish...
26) 5) dialog: How do you suggest we do that? Kyle stands suddenly - he’s huge, about 6’5” and Carter is bound to his torso via a series of nylon jump straps. As his feet dangle, Carter pitches forward until his upper-body is almost horizontal while his hips are still vertically strapped to Kyle. Kyle duck-walks the suspended Carter over to the prescription bottle. Carter extends his arms down but the bottle rolls out of his grasp and into Edward’s outstretched hand. Carter looks up at him. Edward appears as if he hasn’t touched a razor in days.
26) 6) dialog: Not a word. (grabs the bottle) Back to the chair, Kyle. Kyle waddles back to the chair. Carter almost hits his head on the fuselage.

26) 23) dialog: I can’t do this. 47.
26) 26) dialog: I can’t do this! He screams as Kyle jumps and they disappear out the door. Edward watches them fall away then dons his goggles...
27) 0) text: As they leap from the plane, free-falling into the ether. Everything goes quiet save for the flapping of their jump suits. The Co-Pilot dives towards Kyle and Carter, whose scream grows louder as they approach, and lock hands so that Carter and Edward are once again face to face.
27) 4) dialog: No!
28) 0) text: The furious, muffled swearing of the Co-pilot is heard from within the building as Edward and Carter walk towards the limo. Edward has taken out The Bucket List.

29) 6) dialog: We'll see. A whistle sounds and Edward joins the other contestants behind a dozen long tables laid out end to end. Before each contestant is a tray of dozens of hot dogs in buns. Edward looks over at the tiny FEMALE KOREAN CONTESTANT standing next to him. Tries to stare her down. Carter and Thomas watch from the crowd..
29) 7) dialog: Your boss, he’s not all there, is he? 50.

31) 7) dialog: Nah, I think I’m gonna--
31) 9) dialog: Tattoos and hot dogs aren’t exactly what I had in mind.
31) 11) dialog: Fun is fine. I have no problem with fun, I just imagined there'd be more behind this than pretending we’re nine year- old's again. 52.
31) 13) dialog: That’s a wonderful argument.
32) 0) text: Edward winces in pain as the Tattoo Artist inks his shoulder blade. Carter’s reading one of his books.
32) 2) dialog: That's not the point.
32) 8) dialog: I’m going to call Virginia. 53. The Tattoo Artist grunts in response and plunges the needle into Edward’s back. He grits his teeth, containing the scream. Carter can’t help but smile a little as he dials the phone.
33) 2) dialog: Old? Both are dressed in racing suits.
33) 5) dialog: Not where you’re concerned, no.
33) 7) dialog: Ready for an ass-whuppin’? Edward replaces the bandage and zips his suit up. His burgeoning facial hair has been shaved into giant Elvis chops.

36) 3) dialog: It's a racing set up. Steer with the throttle.
36) 6) dialog: It’s a nod in the right direction. The Mustang jumps ahead, cuts the Lamborghini off. 56.

36) 14) dialog: Not everyone can afford to play.
36) 16) dialog: Jesus! (regains control of the car) Why on earth would anybody be afraid to win?
36) 18) dialog: You want to talk about-- You’re the most fearful person I’ve ever known. God forbid you ever open the door a crack and give up even the smallest ounce of control.
36) 20) dialog: Alone, bitter and scared of anything with a hint of emotional consequence.
36) 22) dialog: Ah, screw it. ON THE TRACK; the Mustang revs and roars alongside of the Lamborghini before slamming into its side. The Mustang pulls away then smashes into the car again. Both cars careen off the track, punching through a chain link fence then out into the outer parking lot. LONG SHOT; as the two cars play demolition derby in the empty lot, colliding towards us until they roar past and slam through the striped security gates and out onto the open road.

42) 4) dialog: Well, come on. Turkey ain’t gonna carve itself now. The family shuffles out reluctantly. The boys bid Edward hello, but Virginia says nothing. Clearly, she’s been out voted.
43) 9) text: A HI-TECH RECORD PLAYER; as Edward lays a platter down on the turntable and drops the needle. Louis Armstrong's Autumn in New York plays over the following SERIES: -- IN THE DINING ROOM; Rachel organizes the place settings. Fork and spoon on the left, knife on the right. Opposite her, Edward tries to mirror the layout. Gets it right the second time. -- Carter sits with eyes closed and hands pressed together, saying grace. Edward watches him, eyes flicking around the table to see the rest of the family have their eyes closed. -- JUMP CUTS as Carter hands Edward the carving knife; Edward attacks the meat while the others look on; Virginia watches as her perfect roast is hacked to pieces; a blockish chunk lands on Lee’s plate. -- Edward is a wallflower as the family tucks into the meal, passing steaming dishes back and forth through a lively discussion. -- Edward’s on his second plate. He’s talking now, telling a story that has Virginia mildly on edge. The kids seem to love it, except Rachel who makes eyes at him. Edward returns the look until she points to her closed mouth. He gets the picture and snaps his mouth shut, swallowing his food before continuing. -- Carter stares glumly at the tiny slice of apple pie sitting on his plate. Virginia is marking the size of Edward's slice with a pie cutter. Edward motions for a bigger piece. Virginia moves the cutter. Edward’s still not satisfied. She moves it again. -- IN THE KITCHEN; Edward coaxes a steaming cup of coffee from the copper siphon. He puts it on a saucer and carefully offers it to Virginia who has a chain-gang of dishes going at the sink with Carter and the boys. She allows a thin smile as she moves to accept the coffee, then notices Carter behind Edward, shaking his head not to take it. She looks back at Edward and politely demurs. -- IN THE LIBRARY; Edward waits for the last bars of the song to end before lifting the needle and carefully sliding the record back into it’s sleeve.

46) 7) dialog: Why do you think I’m doing this?
46) 9) dialog: (shakes his head; a beat) At first, you tell yourself it’s a rut; just part of the ups and downs of marriage. You figure the pendulum will swing back the other way like it always has before and everything will be right again... A year goes by, then another and soon you’ve been sleeping only on your side of the bed so long you forget how to reach across and bring her into your arms. You forget why you could never walk down the sidewalk without holding her hand or what it was about her smile that stirred you. She’s the same girl I fell in love with at seventeen. Nothing's changed, but everything’s different. Then I realized, it’s me. (MORE)

49) 24) dialog: Why on earth not?
49) 28) dialog: When was the last time you saw her?
49) 30) dialog: Answer me. Edward just shakes his head. Carter grabs the list and the pen and adds “#11” to the bottom of Edward’s ten tasks.

49) 33) dialog: Why?
49) 35) dialog: Not this. This is too important.

52) 17) dialog: She’s open. She’s open. She’s-- As the ball loops over the fullbacks’ heads towards the goal. Rachel controls it then shoots...just out of the goalie’s reach and into the net. The crowd goes ballistic. None more than Carter who leaps into the air, screaming his head off...
52) 18) dialog: Now I’m excited! The scorer sounds an air horn and the game is over. The players converge on Rachel, tackling her in mid-field. Carter looks up at Virginia who is hopping like mad in the bleachers. They share a look. He’s out of the dog house for the moment.

Suddenly he’s hit from behind by a flood of ponytails. Joined by their current coach, the entire team surrounds him as they hop up and down with glee. He lifts Rachel off the ground and hugs her for all he’s worth.
52) 26) dialog: Thanks, baby. I’m just about there.
52) 29) dialog: ‘Bout a month, I guess. It’s an open ticket so-- You take care of your mother for me.
52) 31) dialog: I guess you’ve been the man of the house for a while now. I’m so proud of you son.
52) 33) dialog: (pause) I understand.
52) 35) dialog: Don‘t ever use that tone with me, boy! (a beat; he’s never raised his voice like this) I know you can’t understand why I have to do this...but I do. I have to do it and I'm begging you to respect that. I’ve never asked anything of you son, and if you tell me that it won’t be okay and you won't be able to watch over them for me...then I’ll stay and we’ll never talk about it again. He hands Roger the bag of pills. Roger is unsure what to do. He looks at Rachel who nods slowly. Roger bows his head and wipes his eyes...then he holds the bag out to his father.
52) 37) dialog: Not this trip. He ignores the bag and wraps his arms around his son.
52) 38) dialog: I love you, son. I love you so much. Rachel finishes folding his shirt and lays it gently into the suitcase.

CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D) I can’t tell you how much I miss you all. This is a gift that you’ve given me and everything I’ve seen and done has been through your eyes and with you in my heart. I’m taking all my pills and I honestly haven’t felt this good in years. I hope you’re well and looking after your mother... “I love you” doesn’t come close... Dad.

When the weather came in, which was always, they couldn’t choke off the supply runs, so they flew in the soup... Sonar was all they had back then. They used to try to ping off the mountains to plot their course between ‘em. Sometimes it worked... Sixty years and they’re still finding wreckage up there.
72) 10) dialog: Two years on the hump. Not a scratch on him.
72) 12) dialog: Maybe... When the storms rolled in and he couldn’t see an inch past the windshield, he used to close his eyes and focus until he couldn't hear the copilot or even the engines. He’d focus until everything fell away except the mountains passing on either side. He could hear them and, ‘til the day he passed, he swore they could hear him in return.
72) 14) dialog: I asked him once. Near as he could figure- “Voice of god,” he said.
