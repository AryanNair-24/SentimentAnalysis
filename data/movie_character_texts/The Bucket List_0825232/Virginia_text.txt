I don’t wish that on you, Mr. Cole, I wouldn’t wish it on anyone, but I know what I know about these things, and you might want to make what ever peace you can with god and give back just a little bit of the respect you so desperately demand, because as far as I can tell, you are going to die alone. 28.

She looks back at Edward and politely demurs. -- IN THE LIBRARY; Edward waits for the last bars of the song to end before lifting the needle and carefully sliding the record back into it’s sleeve.
