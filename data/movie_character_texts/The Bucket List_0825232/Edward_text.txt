0) 32) dialog: Kopi Luwak. It’s the rarest beverage in the world. At a thousand bucks a pound it better be.
0) 33) text: Across the aisle, the COUNTY DIRECTOR is flanked by five fellow BOARD MEMBERS who go through the minutiae of beginning the meeting. Edward is in his mid to late 50’s. He’s immaculately dressed and groomed, though his Italian suit appears slightly too large for his gaunt frame. He unscrews a matching cup from the bottom of the thermos and pours a small amount of the brew before handing it over to RICHARD, one of several executives in Edward’s retinue.
0) 34) dialog: (coaxing with his hand) First the aroma. Richard bends his head to the cup, sniffing it.
0) 35) dialog: Note the earthy tones and the complexity of the body.
0) 38) dialog: (to Richard) It’s not ‘just coffee.’ Watches Richard take a tentative sip.
0) 40) dialog: (focused on Richard) Well?
0) 44) dialog: Thank you, Mister Director, fellow board members. Very much appreciate you taking the time... I’m not big on sugarcoat, so you'll forgive me if this comes across as somewhere south of warm and fuzzy... (looks directly at them) All of you should be immediately and pointedly fired. They should haul you up by your boot-straps and dump your bloated salaries into the street. The appalling decline of Jefferson Hospital is a direct result of your gross incompetence and utter lack of fiscal erudition.
0) 46) dialog: Okay, I got a deal. I’m going to talk for a few minutes, and the moment I speak the slightest untruth you can shout me down. Good? Fair? Good... Your shop is hemorrhaging cash. Overhead costs are in the stratosphere. Your lease and land costs were criminally overbid. One of the board members raises his hand to protest but the County Director waves him off.
0) 47) dialog: Donations have atrophied to the point that you’ve fallen hopelessly behind the tech curve in research, pediatrics, oncology, MRI... He pauses and savors a long sip of his Kopi Luwak coffee, eyeballing the board over the rim of the cup until his eyelids close in ecstasy from the flavor.
0) 48) dialog: Mmmm... Put simply, your hospital loses money every time a patient walks through the door. The board members range from uncomfortable to furious, though none say a word.
0) 49) dialog: More truths... The Cole Group is the largest private hospital management firm in the region. We have a proven track record of corporate governance and exceed every requirement of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act... Our shops maintain state-of-the- art technology systems, and wield unparalleled clout in negotiating with unions and the insurance companies... What’s more we've privatized fifteen other public hospitals in the past seven years, each of which now provide the highest standard of medicine to their communities. He pours a second cup of coffee and brings it to his lips.
0) 51) dialog: (pausing before drinking) We employ the best of the best of the best. The stronger the staff, the less need there is for-- Suddenly, he coughs into the cup, spraying coffee onto the table.
0) 52) dialog: Excuse me. Pulls a silk handkerchief to his lips as his suits search their pockets for tissues to wipe the table.
0) 54) dialog: (wiping coffee) That’s because I run hospitals, not bed and breakfasts. The sole concern of my company is to provide the best health care in the world, which we do. (MORE)
2) 4) dialog: (from his gurney) And tell Holcomb I want to know more about this bleo-maya-something.
2) 6) dialog: Bleomycin. Thomas says it eats your lungs. How do I stoke fear in the hearts of my employees if I’m breathing through a hole in my throat for the rest of my life.
2) 9) dialog: I can do it myself goddammit. I’m not dead yet. 11. Then a huge clattering is heard as Edward falls off the gurney. He swears bitterly as the doctors and nurses grab him quickly and lift him into the bed.
2) 10) dialog: Where the hell is Thomas?
2) 12) dialog: You ditched me again.
2) 14) dialog: You let these people drop me. Did you see them drop me?
2) 16) dialog: That’s funny. That’s absolutely, goddamn hysteri-- Lapses into a coughing fit which doubles him over, allowing him a look through the curtains at Carter.
2) 17) dialog: Who the hell is that?
2) 22) text: INT. HOLCOMB’S OFFICE - DAY DR. HOLCOMB is tall and ultra-confident with a runner's physique and shoulder-length hair. He examines Edward's brain scan on a light board.
2) 24) dialog: I just gave you my left nut, if you think I’m going to let you crack my head open and--
2) 26) dialog: (glowering) Beg your pardon?
2) 28) dialog: You’1l understand if I want a second opinion. He heads for the door.
2) 30) dialog: Go fuck yourself. Walks out.
3) 0) text: Electric clippers shave smooth avenues onto Edward's scalp. His mood has not improved. 13.
3) 1) dialog: There’s a guy in my room. NURSE SHING continues shaving his head without a response. She’s Asian, late-thirties with a quiet confidence born of years comforting the sick and dying.
3) 2) dialog: I said there’s a guy in my room. (points to the curtain) Right in there.
3) 4) dialog: I want him moved.
3) 7) dialog: It's not a question of-- Not to pull rank, but this is my hospital. Which, at the very least, should rate me my own room. (to Carter) No offense.
3) 10) dialog: What’s “Mmmm?” Is that some kind of secret cancer code? Why don’t you run down and tell doctor what’s his nuts that I want to see him ay-sap. 14.
3) 12) dialog: (catching himself ina mirror) Jesus... Yeah, those are my rules, (checking her name tag) Phyllis. I wrote the rules.
3) 15) dialog: (grumbling) Mmmm. Carter chuckles some more...
4) 0) text: Edward's bald cranium has been clamped into a large, steel halo. A laser marks a point on his forehead and Dr. Holcomb marks corresponding dots on his skin with a Sharpie.
4) 2) dialog: Oh yeah, what’s that?
4) 4) dialog: What?
4) 6) dialog: The young lion waits in a dream beneath the cold white lantern. What the hell does that mean?
4) 8) dialog: (seething) The young lion waits in a dream...
5) 0) text: As Holcomb and his surgical team operate on Edward who lies in fragile stasis.
6) 0) text: Peering down at Edward as his eyes open slowly, wandering in their sockets before focusing on the perfect visage hovering over him. Her name is ANNA, she’s 26.
6) 4) dialog: How...? Did it...?
7) 0) text: Edward opens his eyes to see the television is turned on to Jeopardy. Carter is sitting up in bed, firing the answers back at the screen.
7) 1) dialog: (barely a whisper) Excuse me... (stronger) Excuse me. (a hoarse shout) I beg your pardon!
7) 4) dialog: The dumbass lion waits in a dream beneath the stupid white lantern. Dr. Holcomb nods approvingly. Marks the chart.
7) 6) dialog: Like someone took a dump in my chest.
7) 8) dialog: I can’t wait. Dr. Holcomb’s expression does little to hide the fact that Edward has no idea what he’s in for. Holcomb surges for the door...
7) 13) dialog: I have a choice? 20. Carter turns back to Jeopardy. Edward takes a moment to accept his situation, then turns his head and studies Carter.
7) 14) dialog: How long have you been here?
7) 16) dialog: Has it been uncomfortable?
7) 18) dialog: The chemo.
7) 20) dialog: (paling slightly) Fantastic.
7) 22) dialog: It's a siphon. Makes coffee. Fumbles his hand for the nurse call button.
7) 24) dialog: Nothing. Just coffee. 21.
7) 27) dialog: It’s called Kopi Luwak.
7) 29) dialog: You’ve tried it?
7) 31) dialog: Why not, it’s the most expensive--
7) 33) dialog: Your wife’s a nurse?
7) 35) dialog: Retired?
7) 37) dialog: What happened?
8) 2) dialog: Guidea. And the meat?
8) 5) dialog: I'm a bottomless pit. It’s true, I could eat twice this much if some people weren’t such goddamn nursema-- He’s cut off as Thomas clears his throat loudly. 23.
8) 6) dialog: What? (to Carter; off Thomas’ look) Oh. Uh, you want Thomas to make you a plate? Tommy, fix a plate for mister, uh--
8) 8) dialog: Right.
8) 10) dialog: Yeah? It’s the best in New York.
8) 12) dialog: You know what they say, living well is the best revenge.
8) 14) dialog: Whadd’ya got?
8) 16) dialog: 
9) 1) dialog: I feel like I’m dying. 24.
10) 0) text: Edward is in bed and covered in sweat as he shivers uncontrollably. His eyebrows are gone and the first chemo burn blooms above his right eye. Carter is curled up in his own bed as he turns the last page of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin: A Poem by Mayakovsky then places it atop a stack of completed books on the floor.
11) 0) text: Carter stares up at the collage of photos and cards taped to the wall above his head. He removes a photograph of his daughter's soccer team. He’s seen standing proudly in the back row wearing a coach’s hat and a whistle around his neck. Edward groans in his sleep and wrestles with his sheets. The bandages have been removed from his head, which is now scarred and littered with uneven patches of stubble. Carter looks over at him until he settles.
12) 8) text: Edward pauses in his typing. Glances over at Carter...
12) 9) dialog: Do you ever miss one?
13) 0) text: Edward kneels on the floor, head resting on the toilet seat, fast asleep. He’s woken by VOICES coming from the room. He weakly pushes open the door to see who it is.
14) 6) dialog: Sorry. He’s a mess as he slowly makes his way around the bed as Virginia walks in from the hallway...
14) 8) dialog: Excuse me. -..as he shuffles over to his bed and wrestles with the cables and tubes. She watches him for a moment then, despite herself, moves to help him.
14) 10) dialog: Thank you.
14) 12) dialog: Mmmm. Don’t you people use words anymore? 27.
14) 14) dialog: Nurses. I meant-- Forget it.
14) 16) dialog: I beg your pardon.
14) 18) dialog: How dare you talk to me that way.
15) 0) text: The copper coffee maker reflects a single light source in the otherwise darkened room. Edward stares at the machine from his bed, eyes lost in the gleaming metal. The reflection shifts and Edward rolls over to see Carter adjusting his reading light.
15) 1) dialog: What are you reading?
15) 3) dialog: Never heard of him.
15) 5) dialog: Quite a life.
15) 7) dialog: I don’t like books. 29.
15) 9) dialog: I never saw the point. History’s just... history. I'd rather make it than read about it.
15) 11) dialog: I've done alright for myself.
15) 13) dialog: Pretty much, yes. What about you?
15) 15) dialog: Would you change it?
15) 17) dialog: I’m sure you do. But you’re a smart guy, must have had a plan for your life before they came along. Carter thinks a moment, then reaches into the drawer of his bedside table and removes his well-worn wallet. He pulls a small square of yellowed paper out from a pocket and unfolds it gently in his hands.
15) 19) dialog: (reading) “Carter's Bucket List”... You weren't much on penmanship.
15) 21) dialog: I don’t understand what this is.
15) 23) dialog: (still reading) “Make a million dollars. Run for president.”
15) 25) dialog: “Help a complete stranger for the good?” How philanthropic.
15) 27) dialog: What’s the one about the mountain? Hands the list back.
15) 29) dialog: (shrugs ) I’m a millionaire a dozen times over. (MORE)
15) 31) dialog: I grew my company from the ground up, built my own house, sold it, built a bigger house.
15) 33) dialog: No, but it sure takes the edge off being miserable all the time.
15) 35) dialog: Which one? We’re talking about dreams, not nightmares.
15) 37) dialog: Dreams are for teenagers. Let’s face it, we've had our time and we did what we did with it. We’re all out of wishes. The genies left our magic lamps a long time ago.
16) 1) dialog: Come on you pansies, it’s one out, how hard can it be? 32. Carter lowers the paper just enough to reveal Edward lying on his stomach with his head propped on a pillow at the foot of the bed, stretching his tubes and cables to the limit as he yells at the Yankee game on the TV. A Red Sox player bloops a single. Edward is beside himself.
16) 2) dialog: That's just... That’s... I can’t take much more of this! Carter's feelings are commensurate as he puts on a pair of head phones and listens to Mozart’s Requiem Lacrymosa. He finishes the article and reaches down for a second newspaper when he sees Holcomb standing at the foot of Edward's bed. Holcomb’s face is pinched and somber as he speaks... Edward listens implacably, his face impossible to read. Carter slides the headphones off to listen...
16) 4) dialog: Doc.
16) 6) dialog: Doctor Holcomb.
16) 8) dialog: You're blocking my view.
16) 10) dialog: (eyes never leaving the screen) One question.
16) 12) dialog: Carter?
16) 14) dialog: ‘Something you needed from Dr. Holcomb?
16) 16) dialog: You are now. Holcomb stares at him but Edward’s attention never leaves the screen. Finally, Holcomb lifts Carter's chart from the foot of the bed and flips through several pages. After several moments, his shoulders drop and he looks up at Carter and shakes his head slowly.
17) 0) text: CLOSE ON CARTER; fast asleep. A square of sunlight moves across his eyes until he opens them and squints into the white light. He rolls over, away from the window and face to-face with a single sheet of yellowed paper propped up against his tower of books. He pulls the paper close to his eyes and sees the title: “EDWARD'S BUCKET LIST.”
17) 2) dialog: Thought you'd never get up.
17) 4) dialog: Six twenty-four. I’ve been up since-- I’ve had a lot on my mind.
17) 6) dialog: Not bad, huh?
17) 8) dialog: That’s one of the tough ones. We’1l figure it out.
17) 10) dialog: You're out of your mind, there’s some great stuff on there. What kind of tattoo do you think I should get?
17) 12) dialog: No, I understood you perfectly. Your whole unfulfilled dreams thing is great for someone with a few decades in front of him, but I’m looking at weeks, months if I’m lucky. (as Thomas enters, bewildered) About time. Thomas turns and walks out. Edward goes after him, pushes him back into the room.
17) 13) dialog: Pack it up, Tommy. We’re blowing this popsicle stand. (to Carter) (MORE)
17) 15) dialog: Your list was a little unrealistic so I took the liberty of paring it down a little. Turns the paper over revealing Carter’s original list which now has several of the items crossed off in red ink - “Run for President”, etc.
17) 17) dialog: I got them both down to ten a piece so if we budget our time properly we should be able to bang ‘em all out before one of us kicks it.
17) 19) dialog: Forget ‘em. I’m only about comfort from here on out. I dunno, give ‘em to some orphans or something.
17) 22) dialog: Blah, blah, blah. Metaphors are for tea- drinkers who read poetry out loud to their sister. You said yourself you haven't done anything. This is your last chance.
17) 24) dialog: To have your own life. To spend what time you have left remembering what it feels like to have a future, rather than wallowing in the past as a guinea pig in Holcomb’s bullshit science experiment. 37. Carter stares at the floor, his mind racing...
17) 26) dialog: You know it is... What do you think, Tommy. You're in our shoes, what would you do? Carter looks up at Thomas who thinks for a moment...
18) 0) text: Empty save for a slow-moving nurse or two until Edward bursts out of the room with a full head of steam followed by Thomas, once again laden with luggage, and Carter who carries a small bag and an armful of books. Edward makes for the elevators as Carter struggles to catch up to him.
18) 2) dialog: What about them?
18) 4) dialog: Why, because you’ve been doing such a great job supporting them from the cancer ward?
18) 7) dialog: (not breaking stride) We're checkin’ out. Tell Holcomb he can take his experimental program and shove it where the sun don’t shine. Nurse Shing comes out of the Nurses Station.
18) 9) dialog: Without a doctor’s written authorization. Also my rule.
18) 11) dialog: Certainly. In fact, Tommy here’s got a doctorate in... What the hell’s it in again?
18) 13) dialog: Education, fantastic! (to Thomas) Really, education? What the hell you doing working for me again?
18) 15) dialog: Anyway, Nurse Phyllis. Seeing as section fourteen, paragraph three of Cole Medical’s operations guidelines fails to stipulate the kind of practitioner necessary to facilitate a release, Doctor Tommy promises to return with a note granting us our freedom post haste. She stops at the elevator door as the other three pack inside.
18) 16) dialog: (taking Carter's books) You won't be needing those. 39.
19) 0) text: Edward helps Thomas load the luggage into the trunk of the waiting limousine.
19) 1) dialog: It’s not like we’re flying off around the world, at least not at first. I figure we knock out the ones we can do locally before heading over to Europe, then Africa and--
19) 3) dialog: Why not? I thought all black people dream of going back to the homeland.
19) 5) dialog: (climbing inside the limo) You're joking me.
19) 7) dialog: You should've put that on the list. He pulls Carter inside and the door closes.
19) 11) dialog: 
19) 12) text: Edward is electrified with nervous energy while Carter looks like he'd rather be anywhere else.
19) 13) dialog: Okay, so I figure middle of three then we go. You ready?
19) 15) dialog: Good. He, along with everyone else around them, looks off in the distance.
19) 17) dialog: Forget it.
19) 19) dialog: Of course it’s not rational, that’s why it’s so exciting. (the crowd groans) That’s our cue. You ready?
20) 0) text: As the Yankee outfielders jog out to their positions. The crowd suddenly ROARS as the left fielder passes a naked man who is jogging and waving across the grass. Carter holds Edward's clothes, staring in disbelief as Edward takes a victory lap towards right field.
21) 0) text: Edward streaks after Carter, whooping and hollering. Carter is actually beginning to enjoy himself until he pulls up short. Edward comes to a stop next to him.
23) 2) dialog: For the record it was my fault. I talked him into it.
23) 4) dialog: Even so, I'd like to pay you back for the bail, if--
23) 6) dialog: Really, it’s the least I can-- 43.
23) 8) dialog: He hasn’t told you. The door to the holding cell opens with a CLANG as Carter is ushered out by a guard. He’s dressed in prison pajamas and clings to a blanket as he shivers uncontrollably.
24) 0) text: Virginia wipes tears from her face as she walks resolutely to her car. Carter follows her, watching Edward as Thomas helps him to the limo.
26) 7) dialog: (to Kyle) You'll have to forgive him, Kyle. He’s on the outs with the wife.
26) 10) dialog: I understand. The CO-PILOT comes out and straps himself to Edward's back.
26) 12) dialog: (to Carter) She’s tough, your wife. That’s good. The Sequel was tough like that.
26) 14) dialog: The second Mrs. Edward Cole. God that woman hated me.
26) 18) dialog: Know what I learned? That independence is the only true gauge of human virtue; what a man is and what he makes of himself. Not what he has or hasn’t done for others. As the Co-Pilot pulls the door open, filling the cabin with whipping wind. Kyle stands and moves them closer to the door. Carter eyes the abyss outside. Edward is nonplussed.
26) 20) dialog: (to Carter) There's no substitute for personal dignity.
26) 24) dialog: Sure you can.
27) 0) text: As they leap from the plane, free-falling into the ether. Everything goes quiet save for the flapping of their jump suits. The Co-Pilot dives towards Kyle and Carter, whose scream grows louder as they approach, and lock hands so that Carter and Edward are once again face to face.
27) 1) dialog: This is amazing! Carter’s too busy being terrified to respond.
27) 6) dialog: Amazing. Nine toes in the grave he’s still afraid to let go.
27) 8) dialog: Right there’s the piss of it. When you’re living for someone else you can’t help but be careful... No progress in careful.
27) 10) dialog: I was in love once.
28) 0) text: The furious, muffled swearing of the Co-pilot is heard from within the building as Edward and Carter walk towards the limo. Edward has taken out The Bucket List. With the red pen he crosses off “Jump out of a perfectly good airplane” just below “Streak Yankee Stadium,” both on his side of the list.
28) 1) dialog: Two down. Eighteen in the pipe. How you feeling?
28) 3) dialog: (oblivious) Me too. Who'd believe that only yesterday we were rotting in a cancer ward? 49.
28) 5) dialog: We live to die another day. (to Carter) I’m hungry. Are you hungry?
29) 0) text: It's the annual Nathans Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest. Participants and onlookers mill beneath a striped tent. Edward wears a contestant’s badge. Carter watches as Thomas massages Edward’s shoulders.
29) 1) dialog: I’m telling you, I got it in the bag.
29) 3) dialog: Goddamn right I am. (to Carter) ‘Sure you don’t want in?
29) 5) dialog: Suit yourself. Hey, when I’m done here, we'll go to that Russian place. Get some of that caviar you were talking about.
29) 9) dialog: You're going down, sister. The whistle sounds and the contestants dive in.
30) 0) text: Edward lags behind Carter and Thomas as they head back to the car. Edward is griping over the outcome...
30) 1) dialog: And what is this dipping the buns in water crap. If you’re going to eat it, eat it... Screw this, I’m going back. Turns back towards the tent then stops cold.
30) 3) dialog: I don’t feel so good.
30) 5) dialog: Go fuck yourself, Tommy.
31) 1) dialog: I don’t know. The skull is kind of cool but maybe I’m more of a Confederate flag kind of guy.
31) 3) dialog: Connecticut actually. Our side won, I can wear any flag I want. What’re you going to get?
31) 5) dialog: What’s meaningful? We’re gonna be dead in five minutes. The heavily inked TATTOO ARTIST looks up at them from behind the counter.
31) 6) dialog: Not literally.
31) 8) dialog: You can’t keep passing on things. We're supposed to be in this together.
31) 10) dialog: So what did you have in mind? Something metaphorical? Something life-changing? Oooh. Ahhh... Lighten up, already. This is supposed to be fun.
31) 12) dialog: Nine year old’s don’t have tattoos.
31) 14) dialog: (to the Tattoo Artist) Am I right?
31) 16) dialog: You must be incredibly proud... That’s it! I got it!
32) 0) text: Edward winces in pain as the Tattoo Artist inks his shoulder blade. Carter’s reading one of his books.
32) 1) dialog: So fine, we’ll do a “grown-up” one next.
32) 3) dialog: Then what is? He suddenly erupts into a coughing fit.
32) 5) dialog: Sorry, I'll tell the cancer to take the day off.
32) 7) dialog: Don't worry, it’s the non-contagious kind... Chop chop, we don’t have much time.
33) 0) text: Edward examines the reflection of his tattoo in the window of a pristine Mustang Shelby GT.
33) 1) dialog: It's not bad, it’s just... Do I really look that--
33) 3) dialog: I was going to say tired. Still, it’s a pretty good likeness. For the first time we see the tattoo - it’s Edward, scowling out from his own shoulder.
33) 4) dialog: And you can’t tell me it’s not meaningful.
33) 6) dialog: (looking at the car) This what you wanted? Carter grins as he nods and pulls on his helmet.
33) 8) dialog: We'll see. 54. He walks around the Mustang to the waiting Lamborghini Murcielago Roadster. Nearly one of a kind, it’s more rocket than automobile.
33) 9) dialog: First one to a hundred miles. Loser buys dinner.
33) 11) dialog: Of course you are. Slips into the car, closing the gull-wing door behind him.
34) 2) dialog: (filtered) Grown-up enough for you? Carter pulls on his helmet. Adjusts the microphone in front of his mouth.
34) 4) dialog: It’s taken care of. Why, you want to pass again? Carter turns the ignition on the Mustang. It’s growl is guttural and primal.
36) 0) text: Windshield wipers clear the dirt as Edward struggles to put the car in gear.
36) 1) dialog: So it’s like that, is it? The gears grind as he works the stick. Finally gets the car in gear as Carter is heard over the headset, cackling for joy. ON THE TRACK; where the Mustang screams around a turn, taking a line close to the infield where the Lamborghini hiccups in fits and starts towards the track. IN THE LAMBORGHINI; Edward wrestles with the stick...
36) 2) dialog: Come on, you stupid-- The car jerks forwards onto the tarmac, right in the path of the oncoming... IN THE MUSTANG; Carter hits the gas, taking the car low across the infield, narrowly missing the Lamborghini before he roars back onto the track. Carter grins into his rearview mirror, sees Edward's car swerving across the track behind him. IN THE LAMBORGHINI; Edward’s trying to control the car.
36) 4) dialog: Which one’s the throttle? He’s about to hit the wall until he mashes the gas and the car suddenly launches down the track. DOWN THE TRACK; Edward pulls even with the Mustang.
36) 5) dialog: So we’re having fun now?
36) 7) dialog: You know what your problem is?
36) 9) dialog: You're the guy behind the chairs at the poker table.
36) 11) dialog: You know, the one who stands there with his hands in his pockets, peering over the players’ shoulders, studying the game like he’s learning something, when all he really wants to do is walk away.
36) 13) dialog: So why’s he in the casino in the first place? He’s dying to get in the game. What’s keeping his hands in his pockets?
36) 15) dialog: I’m not talking about money. I don’t think he’s afraid to lose, everybody loses sometimes. But what I think? I think that deep down, you’re afraid to win. Now the Lamborghini takes the lead, clipping the front of the Mustang as it pulls in front.
36) 17) dialog: That’s between you and your shrink, I just call ‘em where they fall. 57.
36) 19) dialog: My work done my way. Personal, selfish, egotistical motivation. Look where it’s gotten me.
36) 21) dialog: Depravity’s in the eye of the beholder. At least I’m not chicken. IN THE MUSTANG; Carter rolls his eyes, knowing he shouldn't take the bait. He drives evenly for a moment. Then, despite himself...
37) 1) dialog: Do you have any idea what these cars cost me?
37) 4) dialog: Are we really?
38) 0) text: As Thomas emerges followed by Edward and Carter. Thomas carries the police paperwork. Edward's marking up the list.
38) 2) dialog: Chump change. My tab. He crosses off “RACE A VINTAGE MUSTANG” on Carter’s list, then flips it over, putting a line through “GET IN A POLICE CHASE” on his side.
38) 4) dialog: You gonna tell the wife about this one?
39) 0) text: Carter reaches for the door. Edward is sprawled out across the opposite seat watching the Yankee game.
39) 2) dialog: And face Darth Vader, I’m sure she’d love that. Tommy’s got family to get to and I’ve got six innings left.

Holds a take-out menu.

43) 1) dialog: Okay, just let me get a tablecloth or something. Balances the potatoes as he rummages through some drawers he’s probably never opened before.
43) 3) dialog: Just me... And don’t touch anything. This stuff costs more than your education.
43) 5) dialog: Oh. The boys are too polite to laugh.
43) 6) dialog: You know what, screw it. Just dump it all down there. Drops the potatoes with no small amount of relief.

Louis Armstrong's Autumn in New York plays over the following SERIES: -- IN THE DINING ROOM; Rachel organizes the place settings. Fork and spoon on the left, knife on the right. Opposite her, Edward tries to mirror the layout. Gets it right the second time. -- Carter sits with eyes closed and hands pressed together, saying grace. Edward watches him, eyes flicking around the table to see the rest of the family have their eyes closed. -- JUMP CUTS as Carter hands Edward the carving knife; Edward attacks the meat while the others look on; Virginia watches as her perfect roast is hacked to pieces; a blockish chunk lands on Lee’s plate. -- Edward is a wallflower as the family tucks into the meal, passing steaming dishes back and forth through a lively discussion. -- Edward’s on his second plate. He’s talking now, telling a story that has Virginia mildly on edge. The kids seem to love it, except Rachel who makes eyes at him. Edward returns the look until she points to her closed mouth. He gets the picture and snaps his mouth shut, swallowing his food before continuing. -- Carter stares glumly at the tiny slice of apple pie sitting on his plate. Virginia is marking the size of Edward's slice with a pie cutter. Edward motions for a bigger piece. Virginia moves the cutter. Edward’s still not satisfied. She moves it again. -- IN THE KITCHEN; Edward coaxes a steaming cup of coffee from the copper siphon. He puts it on a saucer and carefully offers it to Virginia who has a chain-gang of dishes going at the sink with Carter and the boys. She allows a thin smile as she moves to accept the coffee, then notices Carter behind Edward, shaking his head not to take it. She looks back at Edward and politely demurs. -- IN THE LIBRARY; Edward waits for the last bars of the song to end before lifting the needle and carefully sliding the record back into it’s sleeve.

49) 11) dialog: Being a contestant on Jeopardy? Carter takes his first bite, closes his eyes and savors the flavor. Rachel eyes him carefully, still not convinced.
49) 13) dialog: You realize that could take months. What if you can’t--? Forget it. You figure that one out. (to Rachel) How’s the caviar?
49) 15) dialog: Of course.

58) 18) dialog: Next question. Edward’s uncomfortable with whatever he remembered.
58) 20) dialog: (standing) This is horseshit.
58) 22) dialog: Haven’t I done enough for you? (getting agitated) I set everything up myself. Paid for the cars, the plane tickets. It took me a month getting that dinner set up.
58) 24) dialog: Are you that ungrateful?
58) 26) dialog: Thank you.
58) 28) dialog: She was born on a Sunday. I remember because there wasn’t a single cloud in the sky and I thought it was somehow appropriate... I know, cheesy right?

He sits down next to Carter. Takes an angry breath... 83.
58) 29) dialog: Carl Okafor was an activist. Emily had joined some “save the poor people” thing and I guess they met and she decided she loved him... I saw him a few times. Good looking kid. Smart. Driven. But there was something about him I didn’t... Anyway, when she said they were engaged I told her I was against it. But, being my daughter, she went ahead anyway... We had some distance for a while, she’s as stubborn as her old man, but she seemed happy... The first time he hit her she came to me. I wanted to-- I wanted to beat him into the dirt until he begged for forgiveness...but she wouldn’t let me. She said it wasn’t his fault. He was broke. Had a few drinks. Said she picked the fight... I gave her some money and she went back to him. When the money ran out he did it again. She didn’t come to me that time.
58) 31) dialog: I did what any father would do. I got him a job. Administration in a small hospital in Great Neck. Gave him an office and a salary. Company car.
58) 33) dialog: I let him get comfortable. Let him think he'd got it made until one night, when he was out banging one of the nurses, I had someone crack his computer and move a bunch of money around. The next morning he showed up for work and they arrested him on the spot. My lawyer’s a pitbull. Got him ten years for embezzlement.
58) 35) dialog: She saw through me like glass. Cursed me out in front of the entire courtroom after his sentencing. Called me names you wouldn’t believe. Said I was dead to her. (MORE)
58) 37) dialog: But I figure, if that’s what it took... I grew up with nothing. I’m not proud of everything I’ve done but I’ve played by the rules for the most part. If my daughter hates me and they don’t let me into heaven...well then I guess that’s just life, isn’t it?

66) 1) dialog: (trying to lighten the mood) You ever wonder why all the great historical monuments have to do with dead people?
66) 3) dialog: Yeah, but does being dead have to be a prerequisite? We can’t put up a tomb to the unborn soldier? “He would have died for his country if only his parents had been Catholic.”
66) 5) dialog: My family’s got this plot upstate. My parents are there. Cousins. Grandparents. The whole shebang. We even got a little monument of our own.
66) 7) dialog: I don’t know, I’m not sure they’d have me. I was a real pain in the ass when I was little. Hard to believe, I know. I dunno, it just seems so...colloquial.

76) 5) dialog: Hey Carter, will you do something for me?
77) 0) text: Edward walks briskly through pools of light from the street lamps. The limo pulls up and Carter jumps out.
77) 2) dialog: Telling someone a story doesn’t invite you to be a part of it. You had no right.
77) 4) dialog: Go away. Walks past him. Carter follows.
77) 6) dialog: I'm not afraid of anything anymore. If you took a second to think it through you'd realize-- (stops walking) How did you see it? I knock on the door. She answers. (MORE)
77) 8) dialog: She’s surprised and angry but I tell her how much I love her and missed her, and gradually, piece by piece, the ice starts to thaw?
77) 10) dialog: No, it’s an end. Because you left one thing out. You didn’t think-- How is it fair that I show up after all this time and inject myself back into her life when I could be dead in a week?

77) 20) dialog: That you blame her for your lack of accomplishment. 99.
77) 22) dialog: That you say things like you “wouldn’t trade your life with them for anything”, but deep down you question yourself, so you say those things because you know they’re the right thing to say, rather than what you really feel.
77) 24) dialog: Maybe I don’t...but I know this. I love my daughter. If I didn’t I would be back there, knocking on her door. If you loved your wife, you wouldn’t have to go home because you’d have been there all along. He pulls out the Bucket List.
77) 25) dialog: This is fun, Carter. That’s all it ever was. Then he tears it in half, then again, and lets the pieces flutter to the sidewalk. He sees Thomas standing by the limo.
77) 26) dialog: Call me after you've taken him home. He walks off. Carter stands there, staring at the pavement...
