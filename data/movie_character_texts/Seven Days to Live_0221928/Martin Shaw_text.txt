0) 140) dialog: (talking to himself)
0) 141) text: God, look at that... The cellar seems even older than the house.  It is a larg cold sandstone catacomb.  Several pillars support the  ceiling.  The walls are clammy and cold.

0) 208) dialog: Who was that?
0) 213) dialog: Okay, now let me see if I've  got this straight.  First you  get warnings from a road sign  and then from the weather  forecast.  Which one of us two  was the author again? Ellen feels disappointed and misunderstood.
0) 215) dialog: You know, it's not always easy  for me, either.  But at least I  try not to give in to each and  every neurosis. Now he's got her angry.

0) 220) dialog: For you. He holds out the plate to her.  Ellen throws a skeptical  look at the mishap pastry.  She won't be bribed this  easily.
0) 222) dialog: Come on, at least try one.  It  took me two hours to make  these. Ellen goes back to scratching off the wallpaper.  Martin  changes his tactic.
0) 223) dialog: What I really meant to say was:  I'm sorry.  I'm a real bonehead  sometimes.  But it's just that  I'm worried about you.  I'm  afraid you might get carried  away with something like that. Ellen interrupts her work and takes one of the cakes.  Sh tastes it.
0) 225) dialog: But baked with lots of love. Martin helps himself to a small cake, too.  He bites off piece, and makes a sour face.  Then, he takes Ellen's pie out of her hand.
0) 226) dialog: I think I'd better get rid of  this.  After all, I don't want  to kill you. He turns to leave.
0) 238) text: Martin... did you hear that? No chance - Martin only mumbles a few unintelligible word and continues to sleep. Ellen gets out of bed.

0) 301) dialog: Oh, baloney.  You should just  hear yourself talk! He treads up the staircase.
0) 302) dialog: I'll be in the study, just in  case you decide to get  reasonable, after all. Ellen watches him with consternation.  She goes into the  kitchen, worried.
0) 305) text: Either Martin is right or I am  really starting to lose my  mind... For a moment, she considers taking one of the tablets.  B then, she determinedly throws the whole package in the  trash can.
0) 338) dialog: Where have you been?
0) 340) dialog: Psychology, huh?  So, what side  of the rainbow are we on today? Ellen points out a certain passage in the book.
0) 343) dialog: (impatient)
0) 346) dialog: What? What am I supposed to  sense?
0) 348) dialog: Now you go starting that again.   We decided together, to build  up something new here.  I, for  my part, am working on it very  hard.  But oddly, you seem to  have changed your mind. Ellen wants to reply something but just then, the doorbel RINGS.
0) 349) dialog: Who's that?
0) 355) dialog: Not so bad, if I could get some  peace and quiet around here. Paul understands the side-swipe.
0) 373) dialog: (sarcastically)
0) 375) dialog: Because - you know - Ellen is  receiving messages from road  signs, radio broadcasters and  now from Scrabble game stones. He turns Ellen's letter-board around for the others to se Martin's reaction hits Ellen like a fist.  She feels  humiliated.  She is at a loss for words.
0) 376) dialog: And the best part is:  She  thinks the messages are meant  to announce her death. (makes a "spooky" noise)
0) 377) text: Hooooo... Claudia looks back and forth between Martin and Ellen.  S realizes how serious the situation is.  As opposed to Pau who pulls out a news ARTICLE.

0) 399) dialog: (to the dog)
0) 408) dialog: Hi, darling. Ellen turns around to face him.  She is terror-stricken. His hands are covered with blood.  He seems to be oblivio to it.  In the best of moods, he walks to the kitchen sin while he continues to speak.
0) 409) dialog: At last, I'm back on top!   Seventy pages in one night!   I'd say that just about breaks  the record... He starts washing his hands with meticulous care.  The re stained water runs into the drain. Ellen closes her eyes and fights the panic welling up  inside of her.
0) 410) dialog: Ellen?  Is everything alright? She opens her eyes again.  She takes a second look and se that what she thought to be blood is only wall paint.  Sh discovers a bucket with a paintbrush beside the kitchen  door. She tries to conceal her thoughts.

This very instant, she realizes that this is not the man  she once married.  She knows that the time has come to ta up action.
0) 514) dialog: Hi, darling. Martin ignores her comment and starts to head up the stai to his study.
0) 516) dialog: I told you:  It's too  dangerous.  Besides, I have to  work now. He continues up the staircase.  Ellen follows him.
0) 522) dialog: During the Middle Ages people  were executed at every corner.   What's your point?
