Now, the child is out of sight. Ellen is devastated.  She trips and falls to the ground. The swamp encloses her.  Ellen fights against the marsh  that she is sinking into deeper and deeper. Suddenly, the little boy steps back out of the darkness. He stays a few feet away from Ellen.  He smiles as he  watches Ellen sink into the deadly swamp.

0) 294) dialog: Why not?  She can guard the  house.  By the way, I gave her  a name: Clara. She pets the dog, not noticing the frown on Martin's face
0) 296) dialog: I went to see Prof. Roth!  You  know, I had another one of  those dreams last night.  I saw  Tommi! Suddenly, the look on Martin's face softens again.  He  takes Ellen into his arms to comfort her.
0) 298) dialog: You know, Martin, since we  moved to this house...  sometimes I just get the  feeling that the past is  catching up to us again... Martin interrupts her with unexpected ill temper and free himself from the hug.

0) 505) dialog: I am starting to get the  impression that all of this is  some kind of bad joke:  I'm  seeing things that are not  there, my own husband is  becoming a total stranger and  your old friend Lindner won't  tell me what he knows.  I have  no idea what you're trying to  prove with this performance of  yours, but I am not leaving  this room before I hear the  truth. No reaction.  Kosinski continues to stare at nothing in  particular.  Ellen gives up.  Shaking her head, she turns to the door.

0) 520) dialog: I know you don't believe me,  but at least hear me out.   Don't tell me you haven't  noticed that we've been going  through some strange changes  since we moved here! We hardly talk to each other  any more, you're writing like a  madman and I'm having these  visions. Martin does not interrupt his work. Ellen slams the articles from Kosinski on his keyboard.
0) 521) dialog: Here, look at this!  Did you  know that our house is built  right on a spot where during  the Middle Ages people were  executed?  They simply threw  the convicts into the moors,  alive. Martin shakes his head.  He smiles and shoves the article aside.
0) 523) dialog: This house, the whole damned  area around here is one mass  grave...  Now you might call me  crazy, but there is something  negative about the place.

A single BLACK TEAR runs out of the  corner of his eye. Ellen grabs the metal pipe and shoves Martin away. She jumps over to Thomas...
0) 704) dialog: I love you!  Don't let a lie  come between us!  Look at this! ...and slashes the pipe at him. The metal penetrates the figure's "body" and destroys the illusion:  The facade of the little boy dissipates into  mud. For a second, Ellen believes to have seen the hideous  figure of a swamp corpse, but the creature instantly melt into the muddy water covering the cellar floor. At this very instant, a loud roll of thunder echoes  throughout the house. Martin abruptly loses all of his strength.  More and more liquid begins to flow out of his eyes.  The strands of mu slither down his body like countless snakes and vanish in the swamp water.  The house begins to quake.  More and more mud seeps in  through the cracks.  The cellar slowly floods.  The walls quiver. Ellen runs to the door:  It is shut tight - there is no w out. The moor is rising.  Ellen grabs Martin, who is still  unconscious and about to drown.  She tries to wake him up

0) 706) dialog: My God... She vigorously tries to wake Martin, but he does not reac The "thing" is coming closer.  It languidly rolls forward Its shape remains hidden underneath the water's surface. Ellen feverishly searches for a way out.  She notices the small cellar hatch. The house quakes more violently; dust flakes down from th ceiling.  Ellen realizes that the entire house is slowly  sinking into the ground.  And at the same time, the moor rising dangerously high. She grabs Martin by the shoulders.  With all of her  strength, she somehow manages to pull him up onto a pile crates below the cellar hatch. The black thing is coming closer.  It rises up out of the moor. Ellen tries to heave Martin outside through the hatch - b she is not strong enough.  Still, she puts up a desperate fight against the odds. The already small opening of the hatch is growing smaller and smaller:  The tremendous foundations of the house are sinking deeper and deeper into the ground. Suddenly, a hand reaches in through the hatch and grabs a hold of Martin. Ellen starts.  She looks outside.  It's Lindner!
0) 709) text: Ellen! A brief moment of hesitation - then the old policeman  determinedly climbs down into the cellar.  By now, the mo has risen almost to his waist. Lindner wades through the thick liquid.  The surface is  smooth - no sign of Ellen. Then, she suddenly dives back up, gasping for air. Lindner immediately grabs her arm and helps her toward th hatch.
0) 710) dialog: It's right behind me. Lindner keeps calm.
0) 715) dialog: Come!  Quick! Lindner climbs onto the crates.   Again, the house quakes.  Single bricks break out of the  walls and ceiling. Ellen's curiosity wins over reason.  She takes a last loo into the cellar. There - in the dark back corner of the cellar - she sees  shriveled figures with hollow eyes, watching the two of  them in silence.  Swamp corpses. Lindner notices her horror, but still remains calm.  He  starts to climb out through the window hatch.
0) 717) dialog: Martin! Martin seems to be regaining conscience.  He opens his  eyes.   Ellen wants to say something, but the thunder in the  background suddenly swells up to an infernal noise. Walls collapse, bricks and rubble crash down - the entire house is swallowed by the depths of the moor. The three watch with open-mouthed horror. Then, silence. Ellen leans over to her husband. Martin is still totally worn out.  He moans.

The car slowly vanishes in the distance, leaving behind t vast, swampy landscape where there was once a house.
0) 736) dialog: Are you expecting company? Martin shrugs his shoulders and walks to the door.  He  opens it to Paul and Claudia.
