33) 8) dialog: All of you - new and old -  You're  all getting the best salaries in  town.  Not one of you has been  hired because of his loyalty.   It's your talent I'm interested  in.  That talent that's going to  make the "Enquirer" the kind of  paper I want - the best newspaper  in the world!
33) 10) dialog: However, I think you'll agree we've  heard enough about newspapers and  the newspaper business for one  night.  There are other subjects  in the world.

38) 17) dialog: (gently) Read it, Miss Townsend.  And  remember - just the regular  treatment!  See you at nine o'clock,  Mr. Bernstein!
38) 18) text: Kane leaves.  Bernstein looks after him, then at the pape Miss Townsend finally manages to open the envelope.  A pi of flimsy paper, with a few written lines, is her reward.

As the barouche starts off, she is looking at h adoringly.  He, however, has turned his head and is looki adoringly at the "Enquirer."  He apparently sees Bernstei Miss Townsed and waves his hand.

43) 24) dialog: (looking around) If everybody's having fun, that's  the way I want it.
43) 27) dialog: (seriously) How would the "Enquirer" look with  no news about this non-existent  war - with Benton, Pulitzer and  Heart devoting twenty columns a  day to it?
43) 29) dialog: (grins) And I do it because they do it,  and they do it - it's a vicious  circle, isn't it? (rises) I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
43) 33) dialog: I told you about Brad, Georgie. He needs to relax.
43) 35) dialog: Some ships with wonderful wines  have managed to slip through the  enemy fleet that's blockading New York harbor - (grins) Georgie knows a young lady whom  I'm sure you'd adore - wouldn't  he, Georgie?

43) 56) dialog: (has stopped dancing) You're wrong.  It does make a  difference to you -  Rector's,  Brad? (starts to dance  again) Come to think of it, I don't blame  you for not wanting to be a war  correspondent.  You won't miss  anything.  It isn't much of a war.

I've come here to tell  you that, unless some action is  taken promptly - and you are the  only one who can take it - the oil  that is the property of the people  of this country will be turned  over for a song to a gang of high- pressure crooks!
47) 4) dialog: (screaming) It's the only vein I know.  I tell  the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
47) 6) dialog: Thanks.
47) 8) dialog: (building to a frenzy) I'm much obliged, Mr. President,  for your concern about me.

53) 8) dialog: (still looking at  Leland) What do you mean by that?
53) 11) dialog: (still holding on  Leland) What do you mean by that?
53) 13) dialog: Because the crackpot who did it  had a copy of the "Enquirer" in  his pocket?

53) 25) dialog: (sharply) I don't have to.  I run a newspaper  with half a million readers and  they're getting a martyred president  this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they  all know I'm married to his niece.   I've got to think of her.

54) 18) text: Kane looks at Leland sharply before he speaks.
54) 19) dialog: (quietly) All right.

54) 35) dialog: The personal note is all there is  to it.  It's all there ever is to  it.  It's all there every is to  anything!  Stupidity in our  government, complacency and self- satisfaction and unwillingness to  believe that anything done by a  certain class of people can be  wrong - you can't fight those things  impersonally.  They're not  impersonal crimes against people.   They're being done by actual persons -  with actual names and positions  and - the right of the American  people to own their own country is  not an academic issue, Brad, that  you debate - and then the judges  retire to return a verdict and the  winners give a dinner for the  losers.
54) 37) text: Kane looks at Leland, but Leland can't be stopped now.  H speaks very quietly - no poison in his voice - no persona indignation - as though he were explaining the nature of disease.
54) 39) dialog: Are you finished?
54) 41) dialog: (with a little smile) You're not going to like it in  Chicago.  They wind comes howling  in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster  Newburg -
54) 43) dialog: (his face hardning  a little) Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
54) 46) dialog: It's simpler than that, Brad.  A  society girl can't stand the gaff,  that's all.  Other things are  important to her - social position,  what they're saying on the front  porches at Southampton, is it going  to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
54) 47) text: Leland has turned, taking his eye again.  Now Kane stops smiles.
54) 48) dialog: She can leave me.  As a matter of  fact, I've already left her.  Don't  worry, Brad - I'll live.

55) 3) dialog: Are you hurt?
55) 7) dialog: You still want to be transferred  to the other paper?
55) 9) dialog: (leaning out of the  hansom cab) Well, you've been getting a pretty  low salary here in New York.  It  seems to me that the new dramatic  critic of our Chicago paper should  get what he's worth. (almost as a question)

56) 5) dialog: I've been talking to Leland.  Emily - You can't leave me now - not now -
56) 7) dialog: It isn't what it would do to my  changes in politics, Emily -  That  isn't it -  They were talking of  running me for governor, but now, of course, we'll have to wait - It isn't that, Emily -  It's just - the president is your uncle and  they're saying I killed him.
56) 9) dialog: That story about the murderer having  a copy of the "Enquirer" in his  pocket - the "Chronicle" made that  up out of whole cloth -  Emily,  please - He's going to be all right,  you know, he's going to recover - (bitterly) If it will make you any happier,  we had nine pages of advertising  cancelled in the first mail this  morning.  Bernstein is afraid to  open any more letters.  He -
56) 11) dialog: (exasperated) What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
56) 16) dialog: (uncomfortably) They won't do anything to Junior,  darling. (contemptuously) Anonymous letter writers -   I've  got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
56) 18) text: Kane is about to say something, but bites his lips instea Emily keeps staring at him.
56) 20) dialog: I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all  right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
56) 23) dialog: Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
56) 25) text: Kane, unwanted, ignored, looks on.  Tightening his lips, walks out.
57) 0) text: By the desk light, Kane is seen working with his usual  intensity,  Reilly standing beside him at the desk.

58) 1) dialog: It is no secret that I entered  upon this campaign with no thought  that I could be elected Governor  of this state!  It is now no secret  that every straw vote, every  independent pole, shows that I  will be elected.  And I repeat to  you - my first official act as  Governor will be to appoint a  special District Attorney to arrange  for the indictment, prosecution  and conviction of Boss Edward G.  Rogers!

59) 8) text: This is said almost inquiringly, as if he were hoping tha Kane would give him some assurance that McDonald is not m a mistake.  There is no answer from Kane.
59) 10) text: Kane is very pleased.  He continues with Reilly slowly th the crowd - a band playing off.  Bernstein joins him.
59) 11) dialog: It does seem too good to be true,  doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
59) 13) dialog: I think it's beginning to dawn on  Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way,  Reilly, I think we may really begin  to hope for a good government in  this state. (stopping) Well, Mr. Bernstein?
