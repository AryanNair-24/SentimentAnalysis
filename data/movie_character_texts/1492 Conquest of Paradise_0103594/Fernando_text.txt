3) 1) dialog: ... The sun set in the west on an ocean where no man had dared to venture.  And beyond that, infinity...
3) 2) text: Pulling back, we discover: A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and a strongly built man in his middle thirties, are riding a mule.  The MAN'S weather-beaten face frames unusually bright eyes. On the screen these words:  ANDALUSIA, 1491 COLUMBUS AND HIS SON are following a windthrashed path at the top of the hill.  COLUMBUS hums a song, and FERNANDO looks up at him in adoration.
3) 3) dialog: Once I asked my Father where he wanted to go.  And he replied:  "I want to travel all over the seas.  I want to get behind the weather..."
3) 4) text: FERNANDO laughs.  He then starts to hum along with his FATHER.
4) 0) text: A rugged landscape, remote and steep, with lines of stone walls and thousands of sheep. FERNANDO, rushes down a slope, barking like a dog, chasin the sheep who fan out in droves in front of him.  High- spirited and wild, FERNANDO laughs and tumbles over. COLUMBUS rides his mule along the narrow track, watching his SON'S antics with amusement.  In the distance, the solitary figure of A MONK SHEPHERD. COLUMBUS calls out to his son:
4) 2) text: FERNANDO runs over.  COLUMBUS lifts him up onto the mule. As they move along the track we now see, perched on a distant hill, isolated and austere, the Monastery of La Rabida, their destination.
5) 0) text: As they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters, FERNANDO suddenly spots a familiar FIGURE, standing under the ROMAN arches.
5) 1) dialog: Diego!
5) 4) text: DIEGO smiles a little, and kisses FERNANDO -- who is immediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS, hurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime. The MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a white- haired, elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer. MARCHENA'S gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his arms to greet COLUMBUS.  He pats FERNANDO'S head and turn to DIEGO.
8) 0) text: DIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard.  COLUMBUS appears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule.  DIEGO turns to go.
8) 7) text: COLUMBUS reaches out -- and touches his shoulder. He climbs up behind FERNANDO, who waves back to his BROTHER as they ride off.
9) 0) text: COLUMBUS leads the mule, carrying the sleeping FERNANDO, through narrow streets.  There's a clamorous noise in the air.  Suddenly a large group of YOUNG MEN, shouting with excitement, run up the street and brush past them.  Then more people.  FERNANDO sits up straight.  The noise grows rowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence. Huge CROWDS have thronged the massive old square outside the cathedral.  Holding the mule by its reins, COLUMBUS tries to push his way through... Suddenly, as a gap opens in the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement:  in the center of the square stand three pyres, already alit. HOODED EXECUTIONERS are busy around the fires.
9) 1) dialog: Look, Father!
9) 2) text: Before COLUMBUS can stop him, FERNANDO has slipped off th mule and into the crowd.   
9) 4) text: But the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people. COLUMBUS tries to follow him.  Flames leap into the night sky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square wit a lurid glow.  Prayers are being chanted somewhere. FERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd. A PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a MAN bound to a post.  The heretic wears the "sambenito", robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been crudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs, indicating that the man is Jewish. THE MAN'S eyes are mad with fear.  But he refuses to kiss the crucifix, as a sign of his repentance. FERNANDO is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't realize what is happening.  He is too close to the platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.
9) 6) text: He motions to his son, takes the BOY'S hand, and drags hi away from the scene.  But FERNANDO looks back.  The distance now allows him to see inside the flames. A HALF-CHARRED FIGURE -- THE MAN'S face is distorted in a silent scream... The neck snaps like burning wood, and th head falls on one shoulder.  Then the whole body collapse into the fire.
10) 0) text: COLUMBUS and FERNANDO lead the mule into the white-washed stone-floored hallway of the modest house.  FERNANDO is mute, shocked by what he just witnessed.  COLUMBUS takes the mule into its stall, and as he does so, his mother, BEATRIX, appears from the kitchen to greet them.  She is beautiful woman in her twenties, a calm, strong, domestic personality.  COLUMBUS tousles the BOY'S hair.  FERNANDO glances at his MOTHER but looks subdued and doesn't say anything.
11) 0) text: COLUMBUS joins BEATRIX in the kitchen, where a MAID is cooking.  He explains Fernando's subdued manner.
12) 0) text: They are eating around the table, and FERNANDO is unusually silent and thoughtful.  COLUMBUS pours a little wine into FERNANDO'S water, to distract him.  FERNANDO looks up at him, surprised.  COLUMBUS smiles, then looks over at BEATRIX.

18) 0) text: COLUMBUS lies face down on the stone floor.  He is dresse in a homespun robe.  His arms are stretched out in penance.  FERNANDO and DIEGO look down at him.
18) 1) dialog: Father?
18) 3) dialog: What can you do?
18) 5) text: A pause -- and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor beside his FATHER, and stretches out his arms in the same way.  DIEGO is left looking on, unable to bring himself t join them.
31) 0) text: Strange, unearthly music... A flickering light in a dark tunnel.  FERNANDO, holding a candle in front of him, walk slowly down the dark corridor. Quietly opening a door, he walks into COLUMBUS' study.
32) 0) text: CLOSE ON:  A huge illustrated map of western Europe and Asia.  FERNANDO'S candle moves slowly across the Atlantic Ocean, to the edge of the map.  There, the illustrator's imagination has created monsters:  terrifying demons; creatures half-human, half-animal. Sitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map.
32) 1) dialog: You can't go there!
32) 4) text: FERNANDO points at the monsters.  He pulls the boy to him
32) 6) text: He takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible monsters, transforming it at once.  FERNANDO laughs immediately.

32) 9) dialog: You promise? (Columbus nods his head) Do you swear on St. Christopher...?

32) 11) dialog: Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?

37) 2) text: FERNANDO nods, tears in his eyes.  Then COLUMBUS embraces BEATRIX tightly.  She whispers into his ear.
74) 0) text: COLUMBUS looks up at the vast roof, to see an incense burner, swinging, gliding swiftly across the ceiling, trailing a think vapor of incense. A magnificent "Te Deum" is being sung -- in honor of COLUMBUS' achievements and return.  The whole cathedral i packed with nobles and dignitaries in their gorgeous robes. BEATRIX, FERNANDO and DIEGO are staring in fascination at COLUMBUS' triumph -- somewhat separated by the grandeur o this occasion.  COLUMBUS passes by, walking proudly down the long central alley, beside KING FERDINAND and QUEEN ISABEL and other GRANDEES.  He turns to his family, keeping his eyes on BEATRIX until she is out of his vision. The procession is followed by UTAPAN, and other INDIANS i tribal regalia... As they move through the crowds, all eyes are upon COLUMBUS.
81) 0) text: UTAPAN is lying in his hammock.  FERNANDO turns him over. UTAPAN falls to the ground. COLUMBUS walks beside BEATRIX.
81) 8) text: BEATRIX nods, but bites her lip, and looks back at FERNANDO.
82) 0) text: FERNANDO is now swinging expertly in the hammock.  UTAPAN is pushing him gently.  He slowly straightens up to watch COLUMBUS and BEATRIX disappear, somehow sensing there is dilemma.  FERNANDO noticing UTAPAN'S reaction, turns to his parents.  The arbor is empty.  FERNANDO becomes pensive. We become aware of the rustling of the jungle.
129) 1) dialog: (quietly) Father?
129) 8) text: DIEGO and FERNANDO look at one another, then back at COLUMBUS, incredulously, seeing his filthy clothes, his eyes rimmed with dried mucus.
129) 12) dialog: This time with me!
129) 15) text: FERNANDO glances at DIEGO.
129) 16) dialog: Nobody is forcing you to come with us.
129) 20) dialog: She's very beautiful!  The Queen has very good taste.  Diego is getting married.
137) 3) text: COLUMBUS walks over to FERNANDO, who is leaning against the rail.  He is smoking a cigar... as the smoke blows over FERNANDO'S face, FERNANDO wretches... It's clear he' feeling seasick, trying to control it. COLUMBUS leans against the rail next to him, staring out at the darkness.  Then looks at his SON again.  FERNANDO won't give in to the sickness, but COLUMBUS knows he'd feel better if he did.
137) 5) dialog: (in a strangled voice) Not bad.
137) 6) text: COLUMBUS nods meditatively, puffs out some smoke. FERNANDO winces, gags slightly.
137) 8) text: FERNANDO shakes his head.
137) 10) text: At the thought of the pork fat, FERNANDO jerks his head over the side, and vomits copiously.  COLUMBUS smiles, pats him on the back.
138) 2) text: SAILORS and FERNANDO rush to the side of the ship, peerin through the spray.  FERNANDO wipes his eyes, and then he sees it:  there in the distance, a speck of land. FERNANDO and his FATHER stand together, watching the low cloud formation sitting on the horizon.
138) 4) text: FERNANDO looks excited.  Discreetly, COLUMBUS watches his SON, enjoying his happiness.
139) 0) text: From the INDIAN treehouse, COLUMBUS, FERNANDO, MENDEZ and several INDIANS are gazing west over a necklace of magnificent lakes. The INDIANS point and talk gently.  FERNANDO has never seen anything so fresh, so beautiful.
140) 0) text: A magnificent sunset.  A fire is burning, food cooking. COLUMBUS looks over his maps, trying to figure out where they are.  We see the outline of the continent of Asia. An OLD INDIAN squats beside him, silent, also looking at the map.  Then, slowly and very deliberately, he takes a piece of charcoal from the fire and begins to draw on the map.  Ignoring the Asian continent, he sketches the Panamanian coastline -- an isthmus.  MENDEZ and FERNANDO gather round.  COLUMBUS watches the OLD INDIAN with initial puzzlement, then growing excitement.
140) 4) text: FERNANDO is still confused.  The OLD INDIAN continues to sketch, talking quietly all the time.  An INDIAN TRANSLATOR listens.
140) 11) dialog: I don't understand.
140) 14) text: FERNANDO stares west, then back at his FATHER.  COLUMBUS looks very feverish, his face bathed with sweat.
140) 15) dialog: Father...
141) 0) text: COLUMBUS, feverish, lies on the bunk.  He shivers violently.  FERNANDO anxiously watches over him, bathes his eyes. Suddenly THE TRANSLATOR enters.
141) 2) text: A little reluctantly, FERNANDO lets him go to his FATHER. The INDIAN crouches over the bed, takes out a handful of leaves from a pouch.  He chews the leaves himself for a moment, until they form a sticky pulp, then opens COLUMBUS' mouth and puts the pulp inside, encouraging COLUMBUS to chew with the motions of his hands. COLUMBUS chews, quickly falling asleep.
146) 2) dialog: Oh my God...
148) 0) text: FERNANDO is crouched on the poop deck, wrapped in a blanket.  He seems in a state of shock:  he is pale and shaking.  As COLUMBUS goes and sits near his son, he hand him a flask of alcohol.
148) 2) text: As COLUMBUS insists, brandishing the flask, FERNANDO notices that his hands are shaking too.  His FATHER'S forehead is dripping with sweat. FERNANDO drinks a gulp and grimaces.  He drinks again and hands the flask back to his FATHER, who does the same. FERNANDO notices dried blood on his FATHER'S fingers. COLUMBUS immediately hides his hand and stands.
148) 6) text: He walks a few steps, lurches, and has to lean against th rail.  He raises his hand to his eyes, grimacing in pain, as if they were burning.  FERNANDO scrambles to his feet and rushes to him.  COLUMBUS' eyes are already fixed somewhere -- fever is eating him up.
148) 8) text: FERNANDO turns around for help.
149) 0) text: COLUMBUS is lying on his couch.  FERNANDO is bathing his eyes, sweeping off the pus that continuously forms in them.  COLUMBUS is drenched in sweat.
154) 0) text: FERNANDO is sitting in front of his FATHER, examining documents and letters.  COLUMBUS has wrapped a shawl around his legs.  He looks even older now, with his mass of pure white hair. BEATRIX comes out with a tray, carrying grapes and a decanter of water.  She places it on a small table near COLUMBUS and touches his shoulder. As she is ready to return inside the house, he holds her back.
154) 6) text: FERNANDO looks up at them above his letters, amused and slightly embarrassed.  COLUMBUS looks at him with a fake air of reproach.
154) 8) dialog: I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
154) 9) text: FERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly.
154) 10) dialog: It's Diego... He is at the Court, with Santangel... He says they hope to get your privileges restored... And maybe the house.
154) 13) text: FERNANDO continues to read.
154) 14) dialog: Fine, it seems.  Diego is thinking of starting a pearl trade, in Santo Domingo... He says he received many letters for you.  Some of your men, mostly.
154) 16) dialog: This one is from Mendez!
154) 19) dialog: He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
154) 21) text: FERNANDO laughs -- then, suddenly serious.
154) 22) dialog: I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
154) 24) dialog: Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
154) 27) text: We see the page.  FERNANDO writes: ... I REMEMBER... A drop of ink falls from the quill onto the page and the words. FERNANDO is waiting.
