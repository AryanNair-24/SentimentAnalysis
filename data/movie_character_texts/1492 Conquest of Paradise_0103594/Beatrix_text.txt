A magnificent "Te Deum" is being sung -- in honor of COLUMBUS' achievements and return.  The whole cathedral i packed with nobles and dignitaries in their gorgeous robes. BEATRIX, FERNANDO and DIEGO are staring in fascination at COLUMBUS' triumph -- somewhat separated by the grandeur o this occasion.
