58) 6) text: His friends laugh.  Innocently, the INDIAN has taken it b the blade.  He yelps, looks down at the blood welling up... A moment of tension... Then MENDEZ laughs at his clumsiness, and the ELDERS laugh too... and the INDIAN laughs. Just outside this circle, we see the first INDIAN we saw, squatting on his haunches, watching.  This is UTAPAN.
59) 2) text: He looks up.  UTAPAN is squatting in the doorway of the hut.  He's been there all night.  COLUMBUS takes more ink on his quill and begins to sketch UTAPAN'S face in the margin of his log-book.  He draws well. He gets up and walks over to UTAPAN and shows him the drawing.  It's an electrifying moment.  UTAPAN is shocked and amazed.  At first he is rather frightened of his own image... Then he is happy, and laughs... and COLUMBUS laughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder in a gesture of friendship. UTAPAN gets up, and indicates that he too has something h wishes to offer.
60) 0) text: UTAPAN expertly scampering through the jungle.  COLUMBUS follows him. UTAPAN orders COLUMBUS to sit.  COLUMBUS obeys.  UTAPAN looks up at the tops of the trees.  The sun is rising, an filters through the foliage.  As if the time had come, UTAPAN stands up, and COLUMBUS does the same. A gap in the dense vegetation.  Something is glittering. Gold.  A mass of gold.  As they approach, COLUMBUS discovers -- A large pool of fresh water.  The morning sunlight has turned the water into liquid gold.  The surface ripples with the breeze.  UTAPAN smiles.  It the stranger satisfied?  Isn't this what he came for? COLUMBUS plunges into the pool.  As he emerges, he fills his palms with liquid gold.
61) 0) text: Wide shot -- A flotilla of canoes are going upstream. INDIANS AND SPANIARDS are traveling together in the canoes.  UTAPAN leads the expedition in COLUMBUS' craft. THE SHIP BOY'S cranium is shaved like UTAPAN'S, and we notice that some other crew members are beardless, some even wearing tribal patterns.
62) 0) text: INDIAN VILLAGERS confronting the SPANIARDS, UTAPAN talks to an ELDER MAN, watched by COLUMBUS, MENDEZ and PINZON. UTAPAN repeats several times the word for GOLD, showing some artifacts.  The OLD INDIAN shakes his head no, indicating another distant place.

64) 0) text: Led by UTAPAN, the SPANIARDS hack their way through thick jungle.  It's hard work.  The MEN sweat.  This is inhospitable terrain.  Even the noises of the jungle seem somehow more sinister...
64) 3) text: ALONSO is quiet and silent.  His eyes are looking around at his companions.  UTAPAN shakes his head.  There is nothing he can do. ALONSO is now leaning back, supported by one of his friends.  He has grabbed the forearm of a SAILOR.  His look is already far away.  His companion shouts at UTAPAN
64) 5) dialog: He dead.
66) 0) text: UTAPAN and the SPANIARDS are trekking in the hills.  Full armed, they are now suffering intensely from the heat and the vicious insect bites. COLUMBUS doggedly keeps up with UTAPAN, who tirelessly trots forward. Finally, COLUMBUS turns around and sees... nobody.  He calls out to UTAPAN.
66) 2) text: UTAPAN stops obediently, and rushes back to COLUMBUS with comical energy. On their way back, they find one SOLDIER sitting, leaning against a tree.  He has removed his helmet.  His hair sticking to his forehead. As COLUMBUS and UTAPAN walk back, they find another SAILOR, then another, then the whole group gathered aroun PINZON.  Ashen, he burns with fever.  He attempts a smile
67) 0) text: A line of SPANIARDS and INDIANS threading their way down mountainside.  PINZON is being carried on a makeshift stretcher.  His eyes are closed, his face thick with sweat. They enter a village, to the surprise of the INDIANS. UTAPAN once again at the front as the ambassador.

69) 0) text: In the half-light, figures wreathed in smoke -- COLUMBUS, MENDEZ and UTAPAN watch the CHIEF GUARIONEX putting a Spanish helmet on his head.  The helmet is too big, almos covering his eyes.  The ELDERS appraise the gift with solemn wonder. In return, GUARIONEX hands COLUMBUS a parcel made of leaves.  COLUMBUS unwraps them.  Inside:  a GOLD grimacin mask.  The first real piece of gold.  COLUMBUS is unable to conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of the metal. He waits for the CHIEF to speak, but the CHIEF only looks at him.  On the ground, we see other presents offered by the SPANIARDS -- trinkets, and necklaces...

74) 0) text: COLUMBUS looks up at the vast roof, to see an incense burner, swinging, gliding swiftly across the ceiling, trailing a think vapor of incense. A magnificent "Te Deum" is being sung -- in honor of COLUMBUS' achievements and return.  The whole cathedral i packed with nobles and dignitaries in their gorgeous robes. BEATRIX, FERNANDO and DIEGO are staring in fascination at COLUMBUS' triumph -- somewhat separated by the grandeur o this occasion.  COLUMBUS passes by, walking proudly down the long central alley, beside KING FERDINAND and QUEEN ISABEL and other GRANDEES.  He turns to his family, keeping his eyes on BEATRIX until she is out of his vision. The procession is followed by UTAPAN, and other INDIANS i tribal regalia... As they move through the crowds, all eyes are upon COLUMBUS.
77) 10) text: COLUMBUS nods, turns and whispers something to a SERVANT standing just behind his chair.  The SERVANT goes to open the door -- and in comes UTAPAN, dressed as a tribesman, carrying a casket.  The WOMEN around the table fan themselves furiously at the sight.  UTAPAN puts the caske down in front of the QUEEN, and steps back.

FERNANDO noticing UTAPAN'S reaction, turns to his parents.  The arbor is empty.  FERNANDO becomes pensive. We become aware of the rustling of the jungle.
83) 0) text: FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN spread along the beach, looking towards the jungle.  COLUMBUS stands beside his BROTHERS, and MENDEZ, and UTAPAN. MOXICA, astride a magnificent black horse, prances back and forth across the sand.  All are waiting. A signal cannon is fired from one of the ships.  Birds scatter into the air from the jungle -- but then silence, complete and ominous.  COLUMBUS stares into the jungle. Nothing.  No one to greet them -- no welcoming party from the MEN they left behind. COLUMBUS glances at MENDEZ. MENDEZ looks at him, but can't answer. MOXICA suddenly spurs on his horse, and guides it into th trees.  The order is given for the rest to follow, fannin out as they do so, weapons at the ready.
85) 0) text: MOXICA mounted on his magnificent BLACK STALLION canters to the edge of the deserted village and enters the village.  UTAPAN is terrorized by the absence of anything living. All we can hear is the breathing of the horse.  The animal, an impressive mass of muscle, prances nervously. UTAPAN calls out in dialect.
85) 1) dialog: They here.
85) 2) text: Slowly, they begin to appear, one after the other -- materializing from the jungle.  Shy and scared. They stare at this "Centaur" (the HORSE and the HORSEMAN seem to be one -- a God). To impress them even more, MOXICA makes the beast move sideways and backwards, rearing, its front hoofs pawing the air.  THE INDIANS retreat in terror, except for one, who stands his ground, brandishing his lance. UTAPAN encourages the YOUNG WARRIOR to approach the centaur.  He places his hand onto the shoulder of the animal.  The muscles shudder.  THE INDIAN jumps back comically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe. Without warning, MOXICA climbs down from the saddle.  Mor INDIANS step back in fear and absolute astonishment.  Now more have ventured from the jungle.  The bravest of them approach MOXICA, daring to touch him, and the horse, retreating then touching until they fill the compound. At this moment, COLUMBUS and his SOLDIERS appear all around them, pointing their muskets, and their crossbows. A moment of tension. COLUMBUS walks forward, towards the CHIEF (GUARIONEX) we meet before.
85) 5) dialog: Another tribe made war on them... came by sea... took them away...
85) 10) text: UTAPAN looks anxiously at COLUMBUS.

85) 14) dialog: He understands.
103) 0) text: PAIRS of bloody red legs hanging still, high in the air. Pulling back, we discover: A DOZEN SPANIARDS have been crucified on the scaffolding of the excavations.  Some hands and noses have been removed. UTAPAN is standing, uncomfortable among the SPANIARDS. A SOLDIER removes a huge iron nail from a wrist.  One of the CRUCIFIED BODIES is gently laid on the ground.  He is still alive -- not for long. COLUMBUS and BARTOLOME are silent with rage.
103) 2) text: BARTOLOME turns to UTAPAN.
103) 4) text: UTAPAN looks distraught -- this is the first time he is being asked to do something against his own people.  He looks up at COLUMBUS for help in confusion.

104) 0) text: Around a campfire, two dozen INDIANS are squatting.  They are arguing over a musket and some woolen hats they stole from the mine.  CLICK!  CLICK!  The INDIANS raise their heads.  All around them, crossbows and muskets are pointe at them.  Two INDIANS try to run away.  They are shot. This sound triggers the SPANIARDS' response.  They start shooting at random.  UTAPAN is horrified.  COLUMBUS stand up shouting.

118) 2) text: UTAPAN is still and silent.  A strange and mysterious figure now.
