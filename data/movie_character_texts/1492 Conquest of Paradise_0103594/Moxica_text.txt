77) 0) text: CLOSE ON:  the face of a young, SPANISH NOBLEMAN, ADRIAN DE MOXICA.  Hesitantly, he brings a lighted cigar to his lips -- then pauses. We discover other people around the magnificent candle-li table.  NOBLE MEN and NOBLE WOMEN.  SANCHEZ.  COLUMBUS. QUEEN ISABEL. COLUMBUS takes the cigar from MOXICA.  The rest watch him with rapt curiosity.  COLUMBUS inhales deeply then, to their astonishment, blows out the smoke through his nose.
77) 2) text: He hands the cigar back to MOXICA.  With a casual air, MOXICA himself inhales deeply -- almost chokes to death. He gulps down a glass of wine... much to the amusement of the others.
77) 3) dialog: (deeply embarrassed) And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
83) 0) text: FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN spread along the beach, looking towards the jungle.  COLUMBUS stands beside his BROTHERS, and MENDEZ, and UTAPAN. MOXICA, astride a magnificent black horse, prances back and forth across the sand.  All are waiting. A signal cannon is fired from one of the ships.  Birds scatter into the air from the jungle -- but then silence, complete and ominous.  COLUMBUS stares into the jungle. Nothing.  No one to greet them -- no welcoming party from the MEN they left behind. COLUMBUS glances at MENDEZ. MENDEZ looks at him, but can't answer. MOXICA suddenly spurs on his horse, and guides it into th trees.  The order is given for the rest to follow, fannin out as they do so, weapons at the ready.
84) 1) dialog: Is this your new world, Don Colon?
84) 9) dialog: We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
84) 15) dialog: We don't need to know.
85) 0) text: MOXICA mounted on his magnificent BLACK STALLION canters to the edge of the deserted village and enters the village.  UTAPAN is terrorized by the absence of anything living. All we can hear is the breathing of the horse.  The animal, an impressive mass of muscle, prances nervously. UTAPAN calls out in dialect.
85) 2) text: Slowly, they begin to appear, one after the other -- materializing from the jungle.  Shy and scared. They stare at this "Centaur" (the HORSE and the HORSEMAN seem to be one -- a God). To impress them even more, MOXICA makes the beast move sideways and backwards, rearing, its front hoofs pawing the air.  THE INDIANS retreat in terror, except for one, who stands his ground, brandishing his lance. UTAPAN encourages the YOUNG WARRIOR to approach the centaur.  He places his hand onto the shoulder of the animal.  The muscles shudder.  THE INDIAN jumps back comically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe. Without warning, MOXICA climbs down from the saddle.  Mor INDIANS step back in fear and absolute astonishment.  Now more have ventured from the jungle.  The bravest of them approach MOXICA, daring to touch him, and the horse, retreating then touching until they fill the compound. At this moment, COLUMBUS and his SOLDIERS appear all around them, pointing their muskets, and their crossbows. A moment of tension. COLUMBUS walks forward, towards the CHIEF (GUARIONEX) we meet before.
85) 7) dialog: The monkey is lying.
85) 9) dialog: We should kill them, Don Colon.
86) 0) text: It is raining hard.  COLUMBUS is floundering in the mud, supervising a mixed work-force of SPANISH and INDIANS. They are attempting to raise the huge wheel of a watermill. Despite COLUMBUS' shouts of encouragement, it's clear the wheel is far too heavy and the mud too deep. Close by, on horseback, MOXICA watches the scene. COLUMBUS, plastered with wet mud, clambers out of the pit and approaches him.
86) 2) text: MOXICA looks down at the sodden, dirty figure.
86) 4) dialog: My horse doesn't work.
86) 7) dialog: You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
86) 10) text: A beat.  MOXICA stares down at an equally determined COLUMBUS.  Then, in front of everyone, MOXICA has to dismount, and suffer the disgrace of it.
88) 0) text: Water thundering into the new canal.  The huge wheel begins to turn.  The MEN cheer and congratulate each other.  MOXICA looks at his mud-splattered and foaming horse, his eyes full of hatred.
90) 0) text: MOXICA and GUEVARA sit out on the "veranda", watching the MEN return.  MOXICA raises his glass in an ironic salute.
90) 1) dialog: To the Governor of the Mosquitoes!
90) 2) text: They laugh.  We see the smoke and flames from a fire. Four or five INDIANS are squatting on the earth nearby, cooking for them, talking quietly in their own language. MOXICA calls out something in their language, and a naked YOUNG INDIAN GIRL comes out of the house, bringing more wine.  GUEVARA stares at her lasciviously.  MOXICA, letting his hand casually brush against her flank, smiles at him.
90) 3) dialog: Do you want her?
90) 4) text: He turns the GIRL round so that GUEVARA can admire her properly.  GUEVARA nods.  MOXICA lets the GIRL go with a peremptory order, and she disappears back inside. GUEVARA suddenly stands up -- unsteadily -- and sweeping his arm round in a broad gesture, says ironically:
95) 0) text: Excavations carved into a hillside. It is a blisteringly hot day.  At the foot of the hill, GIACOMO sits at a table beneath an awning, with MOXICA an several CLERKS.  ONE HUNDRED FIFTY INDIANS standing in line at the table. In turn, they hand over a small quantity of gold.  The CLERK weighs it on a scale, and notes down each contribution. MOXICA impatiently gestures the INDIANS to move faster with a thonged crop.  An INDIAN approaches the table.  He is nervous.  He doesn't produce anything.  The INDIAN shakes his head, gesticulates, starts to speak rapidly.
95) 2) dialog: He's lying!
95) 3) text: Again the INDIAN pleads and gesticulates.  MOXICA hits hi across the face with the thonged crop.  The INDIAN tries to run away -- but is held by a SPANISH SOLDIER.
95) 4) dialog: Bring him here!
95) 6) dialog: Tell him to put his hands on the table.  Like this!
97) 0) text: MOXICA turns, looks back at the long line of INDIANS, still passively waiting.
97) 1) dialog: Tell them I want them to watch this!
97) 6) dialog: (to the clerk) I can't?  I can't?
97) 7) text: With a single swift action, MOXICA draws his sword and cuts off the INDIAN'S hands. ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  The INDIANS flee, disappearing into the jungle.  GIACOMO arrives at this moment.  He stares at the dismembered hands in horror.
98) 0) text: A tribunal.  Sitting behind a table with his brothers, an flanked by his council, COLUMBUS presides.  MOXICA stands before them.
98) 2) dialog: (casually) Savagery is what monkeys understand.
98) 4) dialog: (with exquisite insolence) You will regret this.
105) 0) text: MOXICA and a group of rebels (GUEVARA among them), silently approach the entrance of the mansion. A GUARD is stabbed and falls on his knees with a cry.
106) 0) text: MOXICA tears COLUMBUS' plans of the city from the wall. On the table, the model of the future city. Watched by the other ARISTOCRATS, MOXICA sets fire to the parchment he has rolled up.  He blows the flames from the torch onto the model.  Fire races up and down the streets of the miniature, as if burning the city of Isabel. A mad gleam in MOXICA'S eyes...
108) 0) text: COLUMBUS leads his party of SOLDIERS through the jungle, looking for the MUTINEERS. They reach the river -- scan the far bank.  Nothing. COLUMBUS nods.  His MEN start to enter the river, led by HALBERDIER. Others follow, wading across, their weapons held above their heads. A crossbow arrow pierces the HALBERDIER.  Without a cry h falls forward into the water, and is carried away by the current. Two more MEN are hit.  One cries out, thrashes around in the water, an arrow protruding from his side.  The river stained with blood. Still no sign of the enemy.  COLUMBUS' MEN nevertheless start to return fire from the bank, creating a shield... others continue to wade across the river.  A MUTINEER is shot down from the branches of a tree... The first MEN come ashore.  Musket fire.  An exchange of arrows.  COLUMBUS is now wading across.  The MAN next to him is killed, and carried away by the current. Now, on the far shore, the enemy have shown themselves. There is hand to hand fighting, with swords and other weapons.  MOXICA kills one of COLUMBUS' men -- but his ow are outnumbered and outmatched.  Already, some are beginning to surrender. In the midst of the fighting, COLUMBUS, sword drawn, pull himself out of the river:  A MUTINEER lunges at him. COLUMBUS kills him with a thrust of his sword -- and walk forward into the jungle.  He spots MOXICA at the foot of cliff.
109) 0) text: MOXICA starts scrambling up the rocks behind him, with COLUMBUS following.  The climb through the dense undergrowth is so exhausting, they are now almost climbin in slow motion.
110) 0) text: MOXICA bursts out of the undergrowth.  He is at the edge of emptiness, swept by a violent offshore wind.  He turns frantically, to see COLUMBUS coming up behind him. Knowing he is lost, MOXICA regains his natural arrogance. He steps backwards towards the edge.
110) 1) dialog: You know what they will say in Spain about my death -- don't you?
110) 3) dialog: You are nothing!  You bastards will never inherit your titles.  We are everything.  We are immortal!
