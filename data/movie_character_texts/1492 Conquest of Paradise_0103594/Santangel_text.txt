20) 0) text: A huge Islamic Crescent being pulled down from the minare of a mosque.  SOLDIERS are holding back a crowd at the foot of the tower.  To the ecstatic cries of the crowd, a Cross is hoisted up in its place... Astride horses, COLUMBUS and the Treasurer SANTANGEL are watching the scene. They push through an extraordinary scene.  The city of Granada has just been reclaimed from the moors after several years of siege.  All around them, SPANISH SOLDIER are herding, bedraggled columns of the defeated MOORS, bearing only a few possessions.  Ragged, half-starved men women and children.
20) 1) dialog: These people built Granada... Centuries ago!  It is a great victory over the Moors, Don Colon -- and yet what a tragedy it is!
20) 4) dialog: It couldn't be better.  Victors can't say no.
21) 0) text: Fabulous Moorish gardens:  ponds filled with golden carp; exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees... The distant sounds of victory. SANTANGEL and COLUMBUS walk through the gardens, escorted by HALBERDIERS.  SOLDIERS pass by, carrying coffers or piles of documents. As they approach the inner sanctum, however, there are fewer people.  They stop by the Lion's Fountain, where several DIGNITARIES are waiting patiently for an audience SANCHEZ appears.  They bow.  SANTANGEL approaches to murmur a compliment.
21) 1) dialog: Your Excellency... truly grateful... your help... as ever...
37) 4) text: But COLUMBUS and DIEGO are unable to find words, and instead they clumsily hug.  Someone taps COLUMBUS' shoulder.  He turns around to see SANTANGEL.  Wordlessly, they hug.
37) 7) text: DIEGO catches it.  Opening his hand he looks at the medallion.  Then looks up at his FATHER, elated. THE SANTA MARIA is now two meters from the QUAY. SANTANGEL is now opposite COLUMBUS.
37) 8) dialog: (casually) Take care of my investment, wherever you're going!
130) 0) text: Like Lucifer and Gabriel, SANTANGEL and SANCHEZ sit on either side of ISABEL.
130) 1) dialog: Granted his faults.  Yes, a hundred times!  But the man is still remarkable.
130) 2) text: ISABEL looks at him, then at SANCHEZ, MOVED BUT CLEARLY UNDECIDED.  SANTANGEL presses his point.
130) 3) dialog: All he asks is a chance to explore this... mainland.
130) 5) dialog: (quietly) In a way, it does, Don Sanchez. (to the Queen) I beg Your Majesty to receive him. To hear him... He will make no more demands.  He has changed.  He is penitent.
130) 10) text: SANTANGEL tries to stop himself laughing.
136) 1) dialog: One chair.  One table.  What more can a man expect, when he tries to sue the Crown?
136) 2) text: They laugh.  With only a little embarrassment, BEATRIX gets off COLUMBUS' knee.  SANTANGEL comes forward, and COLUMBUS embraces him like an old friend.  BEATRIX goes t the kitchen.
136) 4) dialog: On the contrary.  It is I who owe you everything.  Through you, I have been an adventurer, an explorer! It's true I shall never see the new world... but it's here... (he points to his head) And here... (pointing to his heart)
136) 5) text: COLUMBUS smiles.  BEATRIX returns with a plate and glass for SANTANGEL.
136) 6) dialog: What you are, Colon, is a sailor, a discoverer, a man of imagination... not a politician.  You weren't meant to govern -- You cannot be all things to all men.
136) 8) dialog: I wish you could have compromised. It would have made your life easier...
