After months at sea, the work is a joy. When the felling gang is done, the sawyers drag the logs off to hew them into timbers. Soon a small fort is under construction. Pocahontas watches from afar. From time to time she allow the cabin boys to approach her. They secon are teaching h English words. Foragers attempt to catch fish and wildfowl but without t help of the Indians have little success.

22) 21) dialog: Smith sees Pocahontas. He wonders why she is here. Her hair is woven with strands of moss, her mouth painted azu blue. She is the very image of earthly beauty. At a signal from the Chief Priest, the longhouse falls silent. Powhatan offers a prayer to his divinities, then throws his scepter in the dust at Smith’s feet. The audience gasps. Without a moment’s hesitation, his attendants bring in two large stones and set them down in front of the Emperor’s throne. A dozen braves grab Smith, drag him to the stones and lay his head acros&’.them. Smith sees the end has come. The braves raise their huge clubs over his head. The tips are studded with bear fangs and flints. 27. Suddenly, Pocahontas breaks out of the crowd by her father’s side, runs to Smith and puts her hand on his hea The audience is astonished. She winds her arms around Smith’s shoulders. She pressas har head close to his. Her hair streams across his face.

22) 51) dialog: Yes! He is no longer the enlightened, creedless man. She is a being sacred and apart. She is so near that naw world whose existence he has only guessed at, that it seems brought near to him. Two young braves loll in a hammock smoking a pipe. They smile pleasantly at Smith and return to their tobacco visions. By nature they are a silent people. The scolding of a crow is loud above the normal sounds of the village. Powhatan sees Smith with his daughter. He does not scowl as an English father might. In fact, he feels a certain amusement -~ that she should let herself be amazed this way, as though by a strange bird. He is a man free of jealousy, a man of deep understanding. Yat while he does not take her infatuation seriously, he still must keep a close watch on Smith to maasure his utility to the Indian cause. Youngstars play basketball on a strange court surrounded posts with nun-like faces carved in them. Their elders hunt stag in the groves between their gardens, costumed i the skins of their prey so that they can approach them quite closely. They show Smith rabbit and fox tracks and speculate about what transpired at their intersections. They catch fish i traps made of bound sticks and broil them with their venison on hurdles over outdoor fires. In the center of the corn fields stand high towers, where watchmen stand guard against the crowd. Their cries and the noise of their rattles ring constantly through the ai Indian mothers take to the water with their children on their shoulders: The men keep their bows with them. When they are in the water, they tie their quivers to their ha so their hands will be free. They light great fires at night, to show their joy. 44 45 3t. Smith exchanges greetings with Parahunt and Wobblehead. Except for Opechancanough, the Indians receive him as a brother. Gradually ha comas to find his English dress constricting and, piace by pieces, he substitutes for it deerskin robe and headdress. Often they tease him, mocking his English manners, especially his swordsmanship in the woods the morning he was caught. They hold no grudge against him. They are naked, frolicsome, full of good humor, always inclined to laugh, which they do with irresistible grace. It is a pleasant sight to see them wading in the rivers i the cool of the avaning, free of care, living cheerfully and at their hearts’ ease. They do not seek more than the need. They share with their neighbors. They overflow with mercy and loving kindness. They have mo wants beyond what the day provides. Like tha lilies of the field, they neither toil nor spin, yet Solomon in all his glory was n arrayed as one of these. TIGHT ON SMITH - “OTHER SIDE” MUSIC . It strikes Smith that there is soma other way of existing in this world, outside the eternal circle of struggle and desire. Little by little he parts with the ideas that clothe the soul of the European, above all the idea that Man attains strength through force. He assumas, in some Measure, the dress and manners of the Indians as he discovers a self he never knew he had. His civilized brothers have lost something these Indians enjoy like the very air they breathe. Why should he aver wish to leave this Eden? But even as he entertains these thoughts, he half-knows h will not honor them -- that the passionate conviction of this autumn afternoon will one day seem a dream, a passin fancy. For the moment, however, he is a free man. He has opened his eyes. Hae can follow his vision or betray it.

Passing her hands over a fire, she gathers its light into her heart. She tells Smith about the migrations of the birds, shows him where to find the turkeys’ nests and the blueberries, what bark to use for remedies. Wild creatures come fearlessly to her outstretched hand. She looks through a book of drawings of London that he brought along in the boat.
