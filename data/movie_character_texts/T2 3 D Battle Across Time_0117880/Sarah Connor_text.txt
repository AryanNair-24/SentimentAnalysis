6) 16) dialog: How dare you?!  How dare you!?! These stupid cutesy-pie corporate videos make me sick!  Skynet isn't our defender.  It's our downfall! Everyone of you death mongering Cyberdyne bloodsuckers should be barbecued in your own--
6) 18) text: She's a little tense. Sarah takes a second to calm down.  John steps forward an addresses the camera.
6) 22) text: I don't care.  Shut them down.  Now. Kimberley slams down the phone.  Meanwhile, back on the Video Screens, The Connor's PIRATE TRANSMISSION continues Sarah removes her sunglasses and stares at us.
6) 23) dialog: (to us)
6) 26) dialog: The Skynet project is doomed.  One month after its completion, the Skynet computer will turn against its human creators, and launch an all-out war against mankind.  The conflict will last over thirty years, with the fate of the human race at stake. SARAH appears in an INSET FRAME, addressing the camera.
6) 27) dialog: How do I know this is going to happen in the future? (solemn)
6) 29) dialog: Skynet sent mechanical assassins back in time, to destroy anyone who might oppose it. The T-1000 walks into view, framed by dancing flames.
6) 30) dialog: These "Terminators" threatened my life... and the life of my son. WHAM!  CUT TO a lightning-fast collection of ACTION CLIPS from the movie.  The T-1000 pursues YOUNG JOHN. The T-1000 STALKS JOHN through a mall, breaking into a run. The T-1000 PURSUES JOHN down a riverbed.  Three-ton tow truck versus eighty-pound minibike. The T-1000 FIRES HIS PISTOL at John with alarming speed.
6) 31) dialog: But resistance sent a lone warrior. A protector for John. HEROIC SHOT of the TERMINATOR.
6) 32) dialog: Another terminator, programmed to defend human life. TERMINATOR AIMS HIS SHOTGUN directly at John.
6) 34) dialog: And despite certain... reservations... that I had about this particular model, he defended us to the very end.  Sacrificed his own existence to save the future. TERMINATOR lowers himself into the molten steel pit.
6) 35) dialog: And then John and I were alone again. SARAH AND JOHN EMBRACE in their final shot from "Terminator 2," gazing down into the molten steel. TERMINATOR THEME MUSIC ENDS. POP!  We're back with JOHN AND SARAH in the present day, transmitting from their secret location.  John monitors the jamming equipment, increasingly jumpy.
6) 36) dialog: I thought we'd prevented Judgment Day.  But now... it's all starting again.
6) 38) dialog: Skynet must never be completed. STATIC starts to obscure the image. Sarah is a giant now, her blazing eyes filling the Video Screens.
6) 39) dialog: Get out of the building.  You've been warned.  You have five minutes before we-- VIDEO STATIC overwhelms the image.  Computer data scrolls across the screen: UNAUTHORIZED TRANSMISSION: MANUAL OVERRIDE.  COLOR BARS fill the screen; the words PLEASE STAND BY are superimposed. Then-- An instant of STATIC, and we're back to:
7) 25) dialog: Move! The Security System goes nuts.  ALARMS and SIRENS SOUND all around the theater, as the VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM tries to get a fix on the two intruders.  The Video Projection Screen cuts away from Kimberley, to show the two intruders. Kimberley suddenly springs into action.  She completely drops her civilized facade, and becomes a snarling, take- no-prisoners Cyberdyne mercenary.  She grabs for the security phone on the Control Console.
7) 28) dialog: John!  The alarms!
7) 30) dialog: (to Kimberley, indicating the T-70s)
7) 33) dialog: 
7) 36) text: Okay -- d-don't shoot-- Kimberley fumbles with the controls, trying to comply. But as she does, we hear a weird LIQUID SUCKING sound behind her. And the bullet holes in the Cyberdyne logo heals. Where the bullets entered a moment earlier, it left a large chrome "crater." But now, the metal logo SHIFTS and RIPPLES like soft butter, smoothing over the hole until there's no trace of it left. And then, as Sarah crosses to the console, the logo loses its shape and begins to PEEL OFF THE WALL.
7) 39) dialog: Now let's get this thing-- As OMINOUS MUSIC BUILDS, the melting Logo DROPS to the ground, landing in a formless CHROME BLOB on the top step It cast a "shadow" on the "wall" behind it.
7) 41) dialog: John!  Take cover! The Connors dive off the stage, into the audience, and take refuge in the crowd. Suddenly a portion of the chrome mass STRETCHES AWAY FROM THE STAGE, extending out into the theater.  The liquid metal forms a mirrored FACE that reaches out toward us, almost close enough to touch; we can see the AUDIENCE REFLECTED in its smooth chrome features. Kimberley points a shaking finger at the chrome blob.
7) 44) text: Sarah Connor... John Connor... The metal face THRUSTS toward us one more time; but as it pushes forward, the chrome surface changes to SKIN TONES, a snake shedding digital skin.  The T-1000's "human" face is almost fully formed now. The head BACKS AWAY FROM US and retracts toward the wall as the remaining chrome mass transforms into the BLACK FABRIC of a policeman's uniform.  The creature pulls itself into shape of a HUMAN FIGURE.  And in one final transformation, the creature MORPHS into the T-1000's familiar MOTORCYCLE COP persona, complete with sunglasses and helmet. The T-1000 crosses the stage, never taking its eyes off the audience where it knows John and Sarah are hiding. Kimberley sees it coming and panics.
7) 54) dialog: Go with him!  Go get Skynet! John leaps onto the motorcycle behind Terminator.  Sarah fires again.  T-1000 staggers back, then advances.
7) 55) dialog: Get out of here!  GO!! Terminator GUNS THE THROTTLE on the Motorcycle.  It POPS WHEELIE, the back wheel SPINNING and SMOKING.  The T-1000 is coming toward them.
7) 122) dialog: And so the battle continues. On the 3-D FILM SCREEN above them, a final image appears: The burning red eyes of a TERMINATOR ENDOSKELETON.  IT moves slowly OUT toward us, flames reflected in its chromeskull.
7) 123) dialog: And once again I find I owe my son's life to the heroic actions of a machine. And then, as the endo skull hovers directly in front of us, it FADES into the solemn visage of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  A RED GLOW appears in one eye behind his sunglasses.
7) 124) dialog: A Terminator. Thundering drums roll... BLACKOUT.
