7) 44) text: Sarah Connor... John Connor... The metal face THRUSTS toward us one more time; but as it pushes forward, the chrome surface changes to SKIN TONES, a snake shedding digital skin.  The T-1000's "human" face is almost fully formed now. The head BACKS AWAY FROM US and retracts toward the wall as the remaining chrome mass transforms into the BLACK FABRIC of a policeman's uniform.  The creature pulls itself into shape of a HUMAN FIGURE.  And in one final transformation, the creature MORPHS into the T-1000's familiar MOTORCYCLE COP persona, complete with sunglasses and helmet. The T-1000 crosses the stage, never taking its eyes off the audience where it knows John and Sarah are hiding. Kimberley sees it coming and panics.
7) 58) text: The Terminator and John BLAST THROUGH the Time Sphere as Tachyon Particles fly out in 3-D at the audience, revealing the NUCLEAR NIGHTMARE WORLD of LOS ANGELES 2029 The city lies in ruins.  Little fires dot the shattered landscape.  Strange CHROME AIRCRAFT fly through the darkened sky, rapid-firing PLASMA BLASTS.  Grotesque HUNTER-KILLER TANKS tread the rubble landscape in the distance. As the motorcycle HITS THE GROUND and screeches to a stop the CAMERA rushes up to it, moving in TIGHT ON TERMINATOR as he leans the weight of the machine on one leg and turn to look back. Off his look WE WHIP PAN 180 DEGREES, looking back the wa we just came... revealing the TIME SPHERE, seen from the future side. Beyond the outline of the window is the audience, still seated in the auditorium in 1996! Before we have too much time to think about this out-of- body paradox, the T-1000 leaps through the window and run right toward us. THE CAMERA PUSHES IN, rushing toward the evil T-1000, giving him a sense of enormous speed.  The T-1000 reaches out with his right hand -- we see that it's changed into cruel METAL HOOK -- and then SWIPES at us with his left arm, which is now an EXTENDED METALLIC BLADE. ANGLE ON TERMINATOR as he extends the 10-gauge with one hand and points RIGHT INTO CAMERA.  BOOM! HE FIRES RIGHT BETWEEN THE T-1000'S EYES. The T-1000's head splits (saucehead effect) as he falls back and collapses to the ground.  This moment of victory is interrupted by the thundering SOUND of an approaching FHK, even as PLASMA BLASTS begin exploding nearby. Back to Terminator and John as a FLYING HUNTER KILLER swoops into view.  Terminator revs up the bike and takes off just as a MASSIVE PLASMA BLAST punches a three-foot crater in the ground, right where the bike was seconds before. We BURST THROUGH the smoke and fire of the explosion FOLLOWING the bike as Terminator swerves with machine precision, avoiding the barrage of purple blasts.  John SHOUTS over the action.
