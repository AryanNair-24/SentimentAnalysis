6) 17) dialog: Mom... MOM!  The mission, remember? (to us)
6) 18) text: She's a little tense. Sarah takes a second to calm down.  John steps forward an addresses the camera.
6) 19) dialog: Um, okay.  Attention, everybody. This is a warning.  To all civilians inside this building.  Cyberdyne Systems is a menace.  The Skynet project threatens the future of humanity.  We're going to stop it. You've got five minutes to get out. And now, in the Pre-Show Theater, Cyberdyne starts to react to Sarah's uninvited broadcast.  As Sarah's narration continues, we hear a quiet BEEPING, and a littl LIGHT begins to flash from an OPERATIONS PANEL on the raised Dais. A DOOR opens behind the Dais, and we see a SILHOUETTE moving in the dark.  A CYBERDYNE EMPLOYEE walks up to the Dais.  She stands in front of the Video Wall, a dark silhouette against the giant flickering images. This is KIMBERLEY DUNCAN, a Cyberdyne "marketeer" who we'll meet in a minute.  She watches the pirate broadcast for a moment.  Though she tries not to show it, we can tell that she's upset by the transmission. Kimberley picks up a TELEPHONE HANDSET hanging from the Ops Panel.  She WHISPERS into the phone, trying to keep u from hearing.
6) 24) text: Now listen very carefully. John punches a tape player.  The words "INITIATE PROGRAM" flash for an instant on the screen.  STATIC. Then: a nightmare vision of the future.
6) 37) dialog: Mom, we gotta go.  Like now.
7) 24) dialog: Mom!  They've already started!
7) 29) dialog: On it! They pause in mid-descent and OPEN FIRE, expertly blastin the Alarms.  John blasts the alarm on the side column; Sarah destroys the phone Kimberley's holding.  They finis their zip-slides and land in the theater.  They unclip their harnesses and run toward the stage.  On the Video Projection Screen, we can see their faces more clearly.
7) 37) dialog: (noticing)
7) 40) dialog: Mom!  Look out! Sarah turns and sees the bizarre chrome thing, which shifts and changes under its own power.
7) 44) text: Sarah Connor... John Connor... The metal face THRUSTS toward us one more time; but as it pushes forward, the chrome surface changes to SKIN TONES, a snake shedding digital skin.  The T-1000's "human" face is almost fully formed now. The head BACKS AWAY FROM US and retracts toward the wall as the remaining chrome mass transforms into the BLACK FABRIC of a policeman's uniform.  The creature pulls itself into shape of a HUMAN FIGURE.  And in one final transformation, the creature MORPHS into the T-1000's familiar MOTORCYCLE COP persona, complete with sunglasses and helmet. The T-1000 crosses the stage, never taking its eyes off the audience where it knows John and Sarah are hiding. Kimberley sees it coming and panics.
7) 48) dialog: Uh, Mom.  Mom, this isn't good. Sarah turns around and sees the T-70s.  They're trapped.
7) 56) dialog: Hit it, lugnuts! VRROOOOOOMMM!!  The Motorcycle takes off, straight for th back wall.  The TIME SPHERE, which has been flickering slowly from left to right, now hovers in the dead center of the stage.  The Harley hits the bottom steps and LEAPS INTO THE AIR, and with a burst of CRACKLING ENERGY, the Motorcycle flies RIGHT INTO THE TIME SPHERE! The world turns inside out.  As the Terminator's motorcycle enters the Time Sphere, a BLINDING GLARE OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY flashes all around the bike and Sphere. A cloud of TACHYON PARTICLES swirls like tiny glowing cinders in the bike's wake.  The TIME SPHERE EXPANDS, growing bigger and moving toward us.  The mysterious worl behind it rushes forward as well, so we're actually following the motorcycle.  The crackling Sphere grows until it fills the entire 3-D FILM SCREEN. At the same time, the Stage and Theater GO DARK, and all objects on the stage DESCEND INTO THE STAGE, leaving us looking at a PURE 3-D FILM.
7) 58) text: The Terminator and John BLAST THROUGH the Time Sphere as Tachyon Particles fly out in 3-D at the audience, revealing the NUCLEAR NIGHTMARE WORLD of LOS ANGELES 2029 The city lies in ruins.  Little fires dot the shattered landscape.  Strange CHROME AIRCRAFT fly through the darkened sky, rapid-firing PLASMA BLASTS.  Grotesque HUNTER-KILLER TANKS tread the rubble landscape in the distance. As the motorcycle HITS THE GROUND and screeches to a stop the CAMERA rushes up to it, moving in TIGHT ON TERMINATOR as he leans the weight of the machine on one leg and turn to look back. Off his look WE WHIP PAN 180 DEGREES, looking back the wa we just came... revealing the TIME SPHERE, seen from the future side. Beyond the outline of the window is the audience, still seated in the auditorium in 1996! Before we have too much time to think about this out-of- body paradox, the T-1000 leaps through the window and run right toward us. THE CAMERA PUSHES IN, rushing toward the evil T-1000, giving him a sense of enormous speed.  The T-1000 reaches out with his right hand -- we see that it's changed into cruel METAL HOOK -- and then SWIPES at us with his left arm, which is now an EXTENDED METALLIC BLADE. ANGLE ON TERMINATOR as he extends the 10-gauge with one hand and points RIGHT INTO CAMERA.  BOOM! HE FIRES RIGHT BETWEEN THE T-1000'S EYES. The T-1000's head splits (saucehead effect) as he falls back and collapses to the ground.  This moment of victory is interrupted by the thundering SOUND of an approaching FHK, even as PLASMA BLASTS begin exploding nearby. Back to Terminator and John as a FLYING HUNTER KILLER swoops into view.  Terminator revs up the bike and takes off just as a MASSIVE PLASMA BLAST punches a three-foot crater in the ground, right where the bike was seconds before. We BURST THROUGH the smoke and fire of the explosion FOLLOWING the bike as Terminator swerves with machine precision, avoiding the barrage of purple blasts.  John SHOUTS over the action.
7) 59) dialog: What the hell is going on?!  Where are we?!
7) 61) dialog: (realizing)
7) 66) dialog: That was close.
7) 68) dialog: 
7) 71) dialog: Nice shootin', Tex.  A friend of yours?
7) 73) dialog: Now what? Terminator hands John a backpack as he picks up the heavy PLASMA RIFLE from the dead Endo.
7) 75) dialog: I was afraid you were going to say that. John follows Terminator to a blackened doorway, CAMERA FOLLOWING, REVEALING... AN ENORMOUS BUNKER.  Squat and brutal in its design, like a mesa of burnished metal, its sides angling up hundreds of feet to a flat top.  It gives the impression of being only the tip of a vast structure under the earth, which i is.
7) 76) dialog: (awed)
7) 77) text: Oh, man. Set into the face of the implacable bunker are numerous sets of massive doors, some closed, some open to allow HUNTER KILLERS to come and go.  The nearest doors yawn wide as a FLYING HUNTER KILLER emerges onto the killing plain.  Beyond it, several doors down, a huge tracked- vehicle (TANK HUNTER KILLER) is entering the bunker. John takes a peek inside the pack given to him by Terminator.  Inside are metal cylinders the size of a thermos... a futuristic version of German "potato-masher" grenades.
7) 78) dialog: Satchel charges.  Cool.
7) 82) dialog: Where are we?
7) 84) dialog: Skynet.
7) 86) dialog: Pretty intense security.
7) 88) dialog: So... what's the plan?
7) 92) dialog: Hmmm.  Well... at least we're past all the security systems. But what he doesn't see is that the video cameras have already spotted them, and their image appears on the stag right VIDEO WALL. And now, a bad sound.  That same METALLIC SUCKING we hear when the Cyberdyne Logo healed up.  Only a whole lot bigger.
7) 94) dialog: (looking around, nervous)
7) 97) dialog: ... and we're about to meet the night watchman. John backs away as the DEADLY CREATURE CONTINUES MORPHING growing in size by the second.  As the creature comes to life, its head and arms REACH OUT towards us.  John and Terminator back away, momentarily unsure what to do. With a DEAFENING ROAR the metal completes its transformation into a horrific TECHNO-ORGANIC CHROME CREATURE; a kind of "steel spider" nearly thirty feet high.  Revealing a cruel set of razor-sharp METAL TEETH, the creature (call it the T-1,000,000) lets out a SHRIEK OF FURY straight from the cauldrons of hell.
7) 98) dialog: Do something quick!
7) 100) dialog: Any ideas?
7) 102) dialog: Wait! The Terminator sprays the crystallized creature with gunfire, and the T-1,000,000 shatters like glass.  It's blown into a million silvery fragments; the razor sharp METAL SHARDS fly through the air in all directions.  A large cluster of fragments flies right toward our eyes. They hover in front of us, tinkling against each other with a music sound like a million wind chimes.  We feel tiny sprinkles of ICE WATER on our arms and faces as the pieces shatter toward us. John and Terminator look up in awe at the galaxy of metal flakes floating overhead. John looks around, uneasy.
7) 103) dialog: I'm not sure that was a great idea. He's right, of course.  Already the fragments hovering in front of us begin to SOFTEN and MELT.  They turn into floating blobs of liquid metal that start drifting back towards the center of the chamber.  The larger pieces shift, moving to join the floating blobs.  As our heroes watch, the shattered pieces melt and merge together...
7) 106) dialog: Oh, man... This is not good... This is definitely not good... Terminator reaches the Service Platform first, and RIPS OPEN the big Junction Box.  SPARKS jitter inside the box as Terminator jiggers the wires.
7) 109) text: Go John!  Now!
7) 110) dialog: 
7) 112) dialog: NO!  I won't go without you!
