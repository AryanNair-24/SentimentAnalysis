Mr. Blacktree is a shaman  who gets his power from the thunder,  and it's imperative he conclude his  rituals while the storm is still  going on.

0) 406) dialog: The markings he's made on my father's  arms are from the pollen of the tule  plant. The twigs have no significance  other than they've been struck by  lightning and are consequently appeals  to the spirit of lightning. It's all  entirely harmless, a religious  ceremony, not a medical one.

0) 435) dialog: (from the door suddenly) My father, you should know, was a  very successful doctor in Boston, a  member of the Harvard Medical Faculty.  He was a widower, and I was his only  child. He was not an especially  religious man, a sober Methodist.  One evening, seven years ago, he  attended a Pentecostal meeting in  the commons rooms at Harvard and  suddenly found himself speaking in  tongues. (she takes her drink  and crosses to the  sofa) That is to say, he suddenly sank to  his knees at the back of the room  and began to talk fluently in a  language which no one had ever heard  before. This sort of thing happens  frequently at Pentecostal meetings,  and they began to happen regularly  to my father. (she sits) It was not unusual to walk into our  home and find my father sitting in  his office, utterly serene and happily  speaking to the air in this strange  foreign tongue. I was, at that time  twenty years old and having my  obligatory affair with a minority  group, in my case a Hopi Indian, a  post-graduate fellow at Harvard doing  his doctorate in the aboriginal  languages of the Southwest. One day,  I brought the Indian boy home just  as my father was sinking to his knees  in the entrance foyer in one of his  trances. The Indian wheeled in his  tracks and said, "Well, I'll be a  sonofabitch." You see, my father was  speaking an Apache dialect, an obscure  dialect at that, spoken only by a  ragged band of unreconstructed Indians  who had rejected the reservation and  were living in total isolation in  the Sierra Madre Mountains of northern  Mexico. Well! What do you say to  that, Dr. Bock?
0) 437) text: Barbara throws back her head and roars with laughter.
0) 439) dialog: No, no, you miss the point, Doctor.  Not my father's conversion -- mine.  You see, I had been hitting the acid  pretty regularly at that time. I had  achieved a few minor sensory  deformities, some suicidal despairs,  but nothing as wild as fluency in an  obscure Apache dialect. I mean, like  wow, man! I mean, here was living  afflatus right before my eyes! Within  a week, my father had closed his  Beacon Hill practice and set out to  start a mission in the Mexican  mountains. And I turned in my S.D.S.  card and my crash helmet and followed  him. It was a disaster, at least for  me. My father had received the  revelation, not I. He stood gaunt on  a mountain slope and preached the  apocalypse to solemnly amused Indians.  I masturbated a great deal. We lived  in a grass wickiup and ate raw rabbit  and crushed piГ±on nuts. It was  hideous. Within two months, I was  back in Boston, a hollow shell and  dizzy with dengue, disenchanted with  everything. I turned to austerity,  combed my hair tight and entered  nursing school. I became haggard,  driven and had shamelessly incestuous  dreams about my father. I took up  with some of the senior staff at the  hospital. One of them, a portly  psychiatrist, explained I was  generated by an unresolved lust for  my father. I apparently cracked up.  One day, they found me walking to  work naked and screaming obscenities.  There was talk of institutionalizing  me, so I packed a bag and went back  to my father in the Sierra Madre  Mountains. I've been there ever since.  That's three years. My father is, of  course, mad as a hatter. I watch  over him and have been curiously  content. You see, Doctor, I believe  in everything.

The sounds go unheeded by Bock, still as marble. Slowly, raises his head and sighs and then fishes about in his ja pockets to bring out the bottle of potassium and syringe. takes off his jacket, rolling up his shirtsleeve, poking  about for the vein. He removes his trouser belt, which he ties tightly about his upper arm for a tourniquet. Now, h tears the wrapping of the syringe and fits the needle to Fiddling about in the pockets of his jacket, he finally f a crumpled pack of cigarettes. He lights one and returns the business of killing himself, puffing expressionlessly he does. Thunder RUMBLES and rain SLASHES. He carefully d just the right amount of potassium from the bottle to the syringe, peering at the procedure against the light of hi desk lamp. He sets the cigarette on the ashtray, switches the hypodermic to his right hand, holds his left arm rigi out under the light of the lamp...
0) 468) text: He turns slowly to the doorway, his bare left arm still  rigidly extended, the belt dangling, the hypodermic clenc in his other hand.

0) 504) dialog: (a frown darkens her  face) No, I don't want my father in this  hospital. I had a dream about this  hospital. (some of the terror  shows on her face) I dreamt this enormous starched white  tile building suddenly erupted like  a volcano, and all the patients,  doctors, nurses, attendants,  orderlies, the whole line staff, the  food service people, the aged, the  lame -- and you right in the middle --  were stampeding in one hideous  screaming suicidal mass into the  sea. (she stares at him  wide-eyed, reliving  the dream) I'm taking my father out of here --  and as quickly as I can.
0) 508) dialog: Well, let me put it this way. I love  you. I fancied you from the first  moment you came lumbering down that  hallway upstairs. I said to Mr.  Blacktree, "Who's that hulking bear  of a man?" The Apaches are reverential  about bears. They won't eat bear  meat; they never skin bears. Bear is  thought of as both benign and evil,  but very strong power. Men with bear  power are highly respected and are  frequently said to be great healers.

0) 513) dialog: All right, let me put it this way,  Herb. My father and I accept the  implacability of death. If he dies,  he dies, but I'm taking him out of  here and back to Mexico about one  o'clock this afternoon. I want you  to come with us, because I love you  and want children.
0) 515) dialog: We could use you down there, you  know. There's a curiously high  incidence of T.B. And you'd be a  doctor again, Herb. You'd be necessary  again. If you love me, I don't see  what other choice you have.
0) 517) dialog: Oh, for heaven's sake, Herb, I ought  to know if a man loves me or not.  You must have told me half a hundred  times last night you loved me. You  murmured it, shouted it; one time,  you opened the window and bellowed  it out into the street.

0) 525) dialog: No. I've had these prophetic dreams  for seven nights. Seven is a sinister  number. The meaning of these dreams  is very clear, seven times as clear.  I am to get my father and you out of  this hospital before we are all  destroyed.

0) 537) dialog: You're a very tired and very damaged  man. You've had a hideous marriage  and I assume a few tacky affairs  along the way. You're understandably  reluctant to get involved again.  And, on top of that, here I am with  the preposterous idea you throw  everything up and go off with me to  some barren mountains of Mexico. It  sounds utterly mad, I know. On the  other hand, you obviously find this  world as desolate as I do. You did  try to kill yourself last night. So  that's it, Herb. Either me and the  mountains or the bottle of potassium.  I'll be back in an hour or so. I'll  be in my father's room.
0) 714) dialog: I can't make it here, Herb. I'll  crack up. I cracked up once already.  One week here, and I'd be running  naked through the streets screaming  again. I can retain my sanity only  in a simple society.
