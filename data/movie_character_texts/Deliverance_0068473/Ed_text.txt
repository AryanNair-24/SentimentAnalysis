He cries out then crashes to ground with tremendous impact. He is on the ground without his bow, not knowing quite wh happened, shaken, terrified.

It is long and flat and old. Oddly, it is a repeating rif rather than a shuck-action. ED touches it. He goes on, past the gun, and into a canopy of leaves, Here, it is harder to find the blood. He looks at bushes, at the leaves on bushes individually, at pinestraw, at sm pebbles, Back and forth, Finally he finds one drop, and this. one drop draws him further on, deeper in.

As soon as this is established, turns the knife and drives the false teeth back into the mouth, ED takes the knife into his hand again. A low growl comes from him. This is a moment balanced between infinite possibilities: ED could do anything at this point, He has the face of a primitive man. His features are transformed by extreme effort and lack of sleep.
