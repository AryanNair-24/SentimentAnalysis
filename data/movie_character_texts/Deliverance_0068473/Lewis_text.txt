This one has been artifically developed on wasteland in the eity itself. It is a little patch of wild woods hemmed in on one side by an elevated freeway, on the others, by railway sidings and indeterminate industrial buiidings. The targets are pinned to bales of straw and this one is in the shape of a paper deer, They examine their shots and pull out the arrows, The paper deer and the city looming over them makes the archery seem very tame, a fai echo of what it once meant to hunters and warriors. LEWIS straightens up as though suddenly aware of this, looking round at the range with some contempt, his power~ ful chest framed against the freeway.
