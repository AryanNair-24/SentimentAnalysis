How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!  He is drawn to the fire again.

For whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor, I'll pour this pestilence into his ear: That she repeals him for her body's lust.  He puts his hand on a charred log. It sizzles slightly.

68) 28) dialog: I am glad of this; for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound, Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof. Look to your wife, observe her well with Cassio; Look to't. I know our country disposition well: In Venice they do let Heaven see the pranks  They dare not show their husbands. Their best conscience Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown. 
68) 30) dialog: She did deceive her father, marrying you. And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks She loved them most.

I lay with Cassio lately, And being troubled with a raging tooth I could not sleep. There are a kind of men so loose of soul  That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs. One of this kind is Cassio. In sleep I heard him say, 'Sweet Desdemona,  Lot us be wary, let us hide our loves.'  Othello sinks onto the sand. The sea laps at their ankles
