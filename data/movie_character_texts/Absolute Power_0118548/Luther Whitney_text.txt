1) 8) dialog: An enigmatic smile.    Now, from that --
2) 0) text: A nice working class part of town. Nothing fancy here but there's a pleasant feel. The streets are clean, the houses neat and well tended. Luther, carrying his sketchbook, walks along. It's afternoon now. Up ahead is a local bar: RED'S.
3) 0) text: Luther walks in. Nothing fancy here. Strictly working class. And relatively empty. An overweight bald man Luther's age works behind the bar. This is RED. They are good enough friends not to ask each other questions.
3) 1) dialog: (as they nod to each other)
3) 5) dialog: My only failing. As he turns --
4) 0) text: A street of   small row houses. Clean, well tended. Luther walks   toward one. Later in the afternoon. He carries half   a dozen small shopping bags, from the market, the   hardware store, the drug store, the cleaner
5) 0) text: A terra cotta planter to the right of the front door. Luther shifts his packages, tilts the planter slightly, bends down, pulls out a key, inserts it in the front door.
7) 0) text: Evening now. Table set for one. A single candle. Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it down. A gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass. Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner. Luther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at them happily. It's Luther. When he was young. Luther studies the photo a moment.    Then he turns, look out the window.
7) 2) dialog: Now Luther opens the sketch pad, quickly flips past the hands and eyes and faces -- -- we are looking at something totally different:   a mansion. HOLD ON Luther's drawing of the mansion. KEEP HOLDING. PULL BACK to reveal --
9) 0) text: A man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars, begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream -- -- it's Luther, and he's been a  professional thief his entire life. He's a three-time   loser, but his last sentence was so long ago and his  skills are now so vast, so refined, that it is unlikely  he will ever get caught again.
10) 0) text: The grounds as Luther glides through it.     He wears a backpack. The night is cool. He stops. All that separates him from the mansion now is a stretch of gorgeous lawn. Except for Luther, it isn't gorgeous -- it's no-man's land. One final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off, in graceful motion, long strides eating up the ground. He makes no sound at all.
11) 0) text: Thick wood with reinforced steel. Luther stops by the door, takes off his backpack, opens it. He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer of padding at the fingertips and palms. Now he takes a key, inserts it in the front door, turns it, and the instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO:
12) 2) dialog: -- in his hands now is an automatic screwdriver, no more than six inches long -- -- he sets to work on the security panel that is inside in the foyer next to the front door. The screwdriver undoes the first screw, the second --
12) 10) dialog: probing with the wires into the heart of the security panel.
12) 17) dialog: and he's got it attached!
12) 24) dialog: A glance across the foyer -- the lights of the security detector go from red to a warm looking green. Safe.
13) 0) text: The foyer as Luther, once again carrying his backpack, moves across it. Behind him, the front door is again shut, the security panel back on, screws all in place. It's as if he hadn't been there at all...
14) 0) text: Luther walks quickly up -- and here we get a sense of the vast size of the place -- it feels bigger inside than it looked in the moonlight. A Van Gogh at the head of the stairs. Luther moves past it, then stops, goes back, studies the painting. It's a late one, when the madness had him and things were sliding away. Very sad. Luther looks at it admiringly for another moment -- -- then surprisingly he raises his hand,  and for just an instant traces the lines of the painting  in the air, as if trying to figure out how the magic was  done, as if getting ready for his next museum session  -- -- then almost grudgingly, he moves on, up toward the third floor.
15) 0) text: Here's a Hopper. One of the great ones, filled with an overpowering sense of being alone -- -- Luther stares at it almost in awe, whispers "wow," moves on.
16) 0) text: Luther, walking down the third-floor corridor. The corridor walls. No paintings here -- instead we see a series of framed photographs. The first is of a baby girl, the next one of the same child at three. We watch the child grow up in these photos.    At ten she is already pretty. At fifteen a stunner.
17) 0) text: Luther opens the DOOR. It SQUEAKS. He goes inside, closes the door firmly. Next, he puts his backpack down, takes out a low-power non-glare work light, sets it up. Now he looks around. A huge room, a gigantic canopied bed. A nightstand alongside, which contains a small silver clock, three Danielle Steel novels piled neatly one atop the other, several more photos of the happy couple -- -- and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a thick leather handle. Luther. He studies himself in front of a very large full-length mirror across from the canopied bed. Now we realize something -- he isn't studying himself, he's studying the mirror itself. He turns, goes to the sitting area where there are chairs and a sofa and a large TV and VCR.
18) 0) text: It's a vault! And it's FULL! There's cash, naturally, piles of the stuff. Plus all kinds of other valuables we'll get around to. Luther's a little stunned -- it's more than he hoped for. He glances at the armchair -- there is a remote on it that is identical to the one he replaced at the side table. Now he opens his duffel all the way and sets to work. First the cash goes in -- all neatly bundled. Large denominations. Lots of bundles. Next are a series of slender boxes -- The first box as Luther opens it. Jewelry. Into the duffel it goes. Luther, emptying more jewelry boxes into the duffel.    A still more. As he continues to do this --
20) 0) text: Luther has moved deeper into it -- he's finished with the jewelry. Now he's examining piles of bonds. Into the duffel they go. He takes a breath, glances around.    Perfect. Coins.   Antique ones.   They disappear into the duffel. Stamp books.   Gone into the swelling duffel. Luther as he hears now the DISTANT LAUGHTER.     Not so perfect.
21) 0) text: He moves quickly out of the vault, takes a step toward the door -- the GIGGLING is getting LOUDER, closer. Two people. A man and a woman. Luther stops, mutters "shit!" -- glances around -- No place to hide. Luther, grabbing his backpack, moves into the vault, turns off his work light, and shuts the door with the remote. The DOOR CLICKS --
22) 0) text: -- Luther is alone in the darkness. A burst of LAUGHTER now.    Growing nearer still. Luther moves into the back of the vault, crouches down, doing his best to hide behind the armchair. Trapped, Luther waits in silence, trying not to breathe... Now he can hear a SQUEAK -- the BEDROOM DOOR has opened. HOLD.
24) 0) text: Luther in the pitch-black vault. The GIGGLING is MUTED but it is there. He is starting to perspire.
26) 0) text: Luther as the burst of light hits him like a fist -- and it's over. Luther blinks, confused, looks around -- -- because it isn't over, he hasn't been caught. The door to the vault is suddenly gone. Luther is staring straight into the goddamn bedroom. Because the door is a two way mirror. Now it's as if he was watching the bedroom on a giant TV screen. Just a few feet away, just outside the door. Where things are clearly starting to heat up. Luther moves to the armchair, sits.    There is nothing t do now but wait. He settles in.
28) 0) text: Luther suddenly terrified and we find out why.

49) 0) text: Luther -- watching because Richmond's eyes are not shut, they are wide open and they stare at the mirror and the awful look from before is back, only worse, and then without warning, he grips her buttocks roughly -- -- and slaps her hard on the ass, over and over and Christy is shocked, surprised, pulls away. Richmond smiles at her sweetly. Christy.   Shaking her head. Richmond. He continues to smile, makes a courtly gesture, kissing her fingertips in apology.
50) 0) text: Luther, silently applauding.
52) 0) text: Luther, in SLOW MOTION and this is what he does -- -- he reels back in the chair, eyes wide, jaw slack, mouth open -- -- this is a man who has seen everything but nothing has prepared him for this -- -- his arms flop over the arms of the chair, his body loses strength, he tries to look away, can't -- -- and this is what he sees --
54) 0) text: Luther. Back in regular motion now.    Pale, barely able to breathe.

72) 0) text: Luther, going to the rear window. He opens the window slowly and silently. He ties one end of the rope around the leg of a heavy, wooden chest of drawers -- -- now he carefully plays the knotted rope out the window.
75) 0) text: Luther, putting his backpack on securely. The window -- Luther glances out and down.
76) 0) text: Luther -- he doesn't much like this -- but taking hold of the rope, he puts one leg out the window -- only the damn backpack makes it complicated and he's caught for a moment, clumsily trapped with one leg in, one leg out and the backpack wedged against the corner of the window -- -- and at that moment, there is a SCREAM.
78) 0) text: Luther, cursing to himself, forcing his way out the window and it isn't easy, but he makes it and then the rope slips in his hands and for one precarious moment, he is in serious trouble and...
80) 0) text: Luther, getting his grip on the nylon rope again, starting to go down -- but it's difficult going for him.
82) 0) text: Luther in the night, thirty feet up, and he can hear COMMOTION inside the house and he tries to go faster -- -- but it's not easy; the man is, after all, in his 60s and he's dangerously high and his visibility is rotten, so he's doing the best he can, but he isn't exactly flying.

96) 0) text: Luther, bursting out of the underbrush -- -- up ahead is the most dangerous place for him -- -- one hundred yards of open field.   He runs on.
98) 0) text: Beginning to tire now -- and he's only halfway through the open field and... Burton and Collin, behind him, can't see him yet, but they are moving faster -- -- and Burton could probably destroy anyone in a fight -- -- but Collin can fly. And he begins to leave Burton behind. Luther, and twenty yards ahead of him are some woods that spur him on, he pumps his arms, his body straining and his breath coming in gasps and... Collin, graceful and young and in fabulous shape and just ahead is the open field and as he starts into it --
100) 0) text: Luther, running through the woods -- he can hear THEM now, and he knows they're closing on him and he glances back -- -- and smashes into a fucking tree!... hard... and it rocks him, drops him to his knees --

Everything is as it was -- calm and peaceful -- -- now a museum guard moves into the doorway, scanning the room. Luther -- a quick glance over, then back to his sketchbook -- and from that glance it's clear all is not calm and peaceful. The guard checks the room again. Edgy, Luther still works away. The guard leaves. Luther gets set to do the same.

She runs well. Luther.   An imperceptible straightening of his clothes. The jogger.    We realize who she is: the little girl in the photo on   Luther's dining room table. All grown up. Now her face   registers something: his presence. Her eyes go down   to the path, she increases her speed. Luther.   Waving, calling out.
118) 1) dialog: Kate. (as she runs on)
118) 3) dialog: Probably too late for me to take it up. She says nothing -- he gestures toward the path.

151) 12) dialog: (nothing shows) I wish it was true. (shakes his head) Your robber actually went in the front door but came out down a rope in the dark in the middle of the night? (as Seth nods; Luther sighs) If only I could do stuff like that -- I'd be the star of my A.A.R.P. meetings.

151) 23) dialog: Need patience. The secret is just research, research, research -- from everything I've read.
151) 26) dialog: Well, from what I can tell on the tube, it's not a small house. (as Seth nods) There had to be an architect, right? You'd be able to tell which one from public records in the library. And once you know the office, you could break in and find the plans and Xerox them, get them back before morning.
151) 28) dialog: Seth -- breaking in isn't hard -- what's hard is breaking in so no one knows you've been there. Now, after the architect, next you'd want the contractor's office -- and the security company's office. (beat)
151) 35) dialog: Papers said he kept the money in a vault, yes? (as Seth nods) Well, I'm guessing there was probably some secret way to open it --

151) 50) dialog: Seth, you've got to get with the program you expect to catch this guy -- most likely it is a guy, am I right? Some kind of weird loner?
151) 52) dialog: (couldn't agree more) I'm the perfect prototype. (sipping away) But you see any face often enough, you'll start putting things together. That's why these top guys disguise themselves. I read a great article a couple of years back -- damn, I wish I could remember where -- anyway, it was about these makeup experts some of them use -- wigmakers, people like that.

Richmond nods, opens his arms out wide. Sullivan gets up, comes forward. Luther, as he gets up too, also comes forward, leaving the stool, walking close to the television.

Keep HOLDING. Now, silently, the vault door opens -- a gardener steps out, clicker in hand. The gardener -- it's Luther -- he clicks it, tosses it back inside -- -- the door starts to close -- -- but before it shuts, we can see he's returned what he took the night of the robbery.
