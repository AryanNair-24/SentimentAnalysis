118) 26) dialog: We don't see each other anyway -- we haven't seen each other since Mom died and that's a year. (a step toward him) Look, you chose your life. You had that right. You were never around for me. Fine. But I have no plans to be around for you.

138) 0) text: A stove with one burner on high.   A tea kettle is over the flame. It is morning and Kate is clearly not fully awake. She is finishing making instant coffee with lowfat milk and Sweet 'n Low; next she goes to the front door of her apartment, opens it, picks up the morning Washington Post. She unfolds the paper as she starts back to the kitchen --
138) 6) text: Kate sits down hard. Trying for control.      Entering a nightmare. She stares at the paper. The front page. Pictures of the mansion, of Walter smiling on his wedding day, of Christy. But Kate's eyes keep coming back to the smaller headline: Jewel Thief Sought
138) 7) text: She tries to sip coffee, spills. She closes her eyes -- in the kitchen, the pot of WATER starts to SHRIEK. Kate does not move.

156) 0) text: Luther by the bed now, he flashes his light around -- -- what the light illuminates: a bed table full of law books. Expected. A phone/answering machine. The mandatory lamp. And photographs. A proud mother and daughter picture. The daughter is Kate. The mother is a fine-looking woman with a kind face.
168) 0) text: She is, we will find, a top prosecutor for the Common- wealth of Virginia. Her office is a zoo. On her desk, a baby picture of Kate and her mom smiling -- but there is something a little different about it. Seth enters and they shake.

168) 9) dialog: (before Seth can reply) Look, Lieutenant -- I told you on the phone, I'm simply not involved with my father, so this may not be a waste of time for you, but it sure is for me.

169) 12) dialog: Lieutenant -- I don't know the man -- he was in jail when I was a kid, when he got out my mother and I went off to live by ourselves. We don't make contact. He doesn't care about me. I've seen him all of once this past year.
169) 14) dialog: Couple days ago. He said he might be going away. There. I just helped you. Can I go back to work now?
169) 16) text: Seth and Kate realize something: In a different world, under different circumstances, they'd probably be starting an affair.
169) 17) dialog: (snappishly) Quit wasting my time -- if he doesn't want you to find him, you're not going to find him.
169) 19) dialog: I'm saying you won't recognize him. I'm saying he could be just around the corner -- he always kept a safe house --
169) 24) dialog: He never said --
169) 26) dialog: 
169) 27) dialog: -- my mother loved him, all right? -- Even after she left him -- even when she was dying she always talked about him -- 'If only he hadn't this,' 'if only he could have that' --

172) 0) text: They enter.    It's surprisingly tidy. Seth and Kate as they move along.    Seth is watching Kat who suddenly stops dead. The mantle. A large blowup of the same picture Kate had in her office, the one of Kate and her mom -- -- with one startling change: Luther is in this shot, standing there proud and smiling. She has ripped his presence out of her photo. Seth, silently watching Kate. She turns sharply away. He gestures for her to follow.
173) 2) text: Kate. No reply. She has seen something across the tiny room and is drawn to it -- Luther's bed table -- -- and here it is!
173) 6) dialog: (fighting tears)
173) 14) dialog: ... No...
173) 16) dialog: ... He won't come...

205) 3) dialog: Nothing, thank you.

208) 1) dialog: (gesturing around) I'm waiting for someone.

208) 8) dialog: Thank you so much.
208) 9) text: The Waiter nods again, and this time he does go. Kate, watching him, making sure.       Now she sits straight --
208) 10) dialog: Very shaky, trying to hold it together. And now crosshairs cover her face as we PULL BACK to reveal --
211) 0) text: Kate, sitting alone, studying her hands.
213) 0) text: Kate.     It's worse for her.   She glances around -- -- nothing, no one.
216) 0) text: Kate, and it's a question of how much longer she can take it. Her trembling is almost out of control -- she glances around again and -- -- and there he is! Luther Whitney himself, and he looks splendid in his new raincoat and hat -- -- he moves along in the shadow of the office building, toward the cafe, walking with his usual grace -- Luther always seems to glide.
222) 0) text: Kate.   Watching her father come closer. Luther. It's hard to suppress a smile as he walks towards his daughter. Kate, still watching. Luther, almost there.     Speaks softly.
