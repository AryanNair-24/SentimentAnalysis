A gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass. Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner. Luther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at them happily. It's Luther. When he was young. Luther studies the photo a moment.    Then he turns, look out the window.

We're in rolling hill country.     The mansion is dark. Totally deserted. Silence. Now a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL. A car comes rolling INTO VIEW. The motor of the car has been turned off. The lights of the car have been turned off. The car slides to a stop. Again, silence... HOLD ON mansion, a couple of hundred yards away.     Ther is a small field between the car and the estate.

This is a fabulous-looking twenty-five-year-old woman. Long, golden hair, a round face that sets off her deep blue eyes, a tanned, curving body. A bare-shouldered black dress. An expensive necklace. One more thing:   she is staggering drunk. The man is ALAN RICHMOND, wealthy, successful, handsome and fit. Mid-forties. He wears an elegantly-cut suit. Two additional points: (1) Richmond is clearly not the husband in the wedding photo. (2) He is drunker than she is.
51) 5) text: And now they both try and stand. Neither one does it gracefully, neither one does it quickly, but Richmond gets there first and as soon as he is on his feet he begins to strangle her. Christy, gasping, terrified, she claws at his arms, her fingers scratching deeply -- -- but he will not let go. She twists and jerks her body -- -- no good -- he continues to tighten his grip on her throat -- -- and spreads his legs for better balance. The bed table, as Christy, beyond desperation reaches around for something, anything -- her fingers finally close on the letter opener and in one wild stroke, she slashes his right arm. Now he lets go.    And stares, stunned, at his bleeding arm. Then he crunches her flush in the   mouth, a brutal blow, and blood pours from her nose and   mouth and if she weren't so scared, maybe it would   have stopped her, but it doesn't -- because somehow she   manages to maintain balance -- -- and knees him all she has, in the nuts. It's over -- Richmond falls to the floor, helpless. lies on his back, holding his crotch. But it isn't over. Christy, blood pouring down her face, stands over him, the letter opener still tight in her hand. And in her eyes you can see it, the homicidal rage -- -- and she drops to her knees beside him -- -- and Richmond can only lie there, watching her -- -- and she gets a better grip on the letter opener -- -- and Richmond still only lies there, watching her --
