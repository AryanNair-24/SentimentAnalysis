9) 45) dialog: So — what’s this big news then? LITTLE DAISY. We've been given our parts in the Nativity play. I’m the lobster.
9) 46) dialog: The lobster?
9) 48) dialog: In the nativity play?
9) 50) dialog: There was more than one lobster present at the birth of Jesus?
9) 52) dialog: Right. And what about you, Bernie? BERNIE IS AN UNPLEASANT GRUMPY LITTLE BUGGER. (CONTINUED)
9) 56) dialog: 0, I don’t know about that. It’s just that these days they probably don’t have wings — so we don’t recognise them. They probably just look normal like you or me - but still cunningly wander around doing good.
9) 58) dialog: He’s probably right.
9) 60) dialog: Right. Charming child.
11) 8) dialog: There’s nothing unusual about that - my horrid son Bernard stays in his room all the time, thank God.
11) 12) dialog: At the age of eleven?
11) 17) dialog: Hey - hey - it was always going to be a total shit time. Just be patient - and maybe check the room for needles. HE SMILES.

32) 33) dialog: You won't.
32) 38) dialog: The problem with being the Prime Minister’s sister is that it puts your life into rather harsh perspective. What did my brother do today? He stood up to the American President. And what did I do - I built a papier mache lobster head.

32) 44) dialog: What are you talking about? I love her and true love lasts a lifetime. Joni Mitchell is the woman who taught your cold English wife how to feel. Which do you think we should give Daisy - the doll that looks like a transvestite - or the one that looks like a prostitute?

39) 15) dialog: You’ ve mis-spelt ‘consideration’...
41) 15) dialog: Right — right. I see. That is disappointing. I’m embarrassed and almost ashamed. Do you mind if I have a word with Bernard outside... THEY GO OUT INTO THE CORRIDOR TOGETHER...
42) 2) dialog: I’m sorry too, Bernie. Sorry and ashamed and embarrassed that I’ve put you in a school with such total and utter pricks that they don’t get a good gag when they see one.
