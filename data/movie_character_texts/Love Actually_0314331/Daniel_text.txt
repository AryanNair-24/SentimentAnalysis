3) 8) dialog: As you know, Jo and I had a lot of time to prepare for this moment. Some of her requests, for instance, that I should bring Nicole Kidman as my date to the funeral, I'm confident she expected me to ignore. But others she was pretty damn clear about. When she first mentioned what’s about to happen, I said ‘Over my dead body’ and she said “No, Danny - over mine.” And, as usual, my darling girl, and Sam’s darling Mum was right - 100%. So she’s going to say her final farewell to you, not through me — but, inevitably, ever-so-coolly, through the immortal genius of the Bay City Rollers...
9) 34) dialog: Karen — it’s Daniel - can we talk? I’m sorry, I sort of literally don’t have anyone else to talk to. SHE IS IN HER KITCHEN — OBVIOUSLY MID-FORTIES, VERY ENGLI STILL QUITE NICE LOOKING, AND GOOD. (CONTINUED)
9) 38) dialog: ‘Course.

11) 9) dialog: No, but this is all the time...
11) 13) dialog: Well, maybe not into his eyeballs then — maybe just his veins... And then he just listens to music all night and watches videos... THE CAMERA SITS ON THE DOOR.
11) 16) dialog: The problem is, it was his Mum who always used to talk to him and I don’t know... - the whole step-father thing seems somehow to suddenly matter, like it never did.
11) 18) dialog: Yes — good — absolutely — good... I will. (PAUSE) And sometimes when he comes out, it’s obvious he’s been crying. (SUDDENLY A WAVE OF SORROW HITS HIM) O Karen, it was such a ridiculous waste — and if it’s now going to ruin Sam’s life as well - I just don’t know. KAREN JUST TOUCHES HIS SHOULDER.
11) 20) dialog: Thanks for coming. Must be busy days with David and everything.
11) 22) dialog: O don’t be disgusting. Get out of my house. I’ve got to fix dinner. (CONTINUED)

21) 8) dialog: What is this, young man?
21) 10) dialog: And how did it get here? PAUSE. DANIEL REALISES THAT WAS TOO COMPLEX.
21) 13) dialog: I don’t know what to say. I hope you’re ashamed of yourself.
21) 15) dialog: It’s disgusting, isn’t it.
21) 18) dialog: How did you do that?
21) 20) dialog: 0 right... Useful.

23) 23) dialog: So, what’s the problem, Sammy-o? Is it just Mum — or is it something else? Maybe... school — are you being bullied? Or is it — I don’t know — something worse - can you give me any clues at all?
23) 27) dialog: I really want to know.
23) 29) dialog: Even if that’s the case.
23) 31) dialog: Sorry?
23) 33) dialog: Aren't you a bit young to be in love?
23) 35) dialog: Okay, right. Well, I can’t deny it - I'ma little relieved.
23) 37) dialog: Well, you know I thought it might be something worse...
23) 39) dialog: Ahm... no - you’re right. So wait a minute - what exactly have you been doing in your room then?
23) 42) dialog: Wow - wow - so, a bit of a... love theme.

23) 65) dialog: And how does she/he feel about you?
23) 67) dialog: Right. Good. Well, basically... you’ re fucked, aren’t you. SAM NODS.
23) 69) dialog: Although this is a thought. Listen up. Maybe you could use your gymnastics to win her over. Surely that’s: very groovy and sexy? SAM DOES A BRILLIANT HANDSPRING TO GO GET A COKE.

50) 47) dialog: Let’s have it.

50) 51) dialog: Right, right. That is bad news. We need Meg and we need her now. 100 INT. KITCHEN. DANIEL’S HOUSE. NIGHT. . 100
50) 55) dialog: Though you know, Sammy, I’m sure she’s unique and extraordinary — but general wisdom is that, in the end, there isn’t just one girl for each of us.
50) 58) dialog: Fair point... But her name’s Joanna?
50) 60) dialog: Well then, in one way, we're in luck. At least we have the godlike genius of Scott Walker...

59) 59) dialog: Yup. A tiny insignificant detail. Watch this space, Mr No Imagination.. DANIEL LOOKS A BIT WORRIED.
71) 8) dialog: That’s very much the kind of thing you should do. Has she noticed you yet?
71) 10) dialog: Of course.
71) 12) dialog: Ha! No. As you know, that was a done deal long ago. Unless Nicole Kidman calls, of course... in which case I want you out of this house straight away, you little motherless mongrel.
88) 4) dialog: Hey. Great show. Classic drumming.
88) 6) dialog: Tell her then.
88) 8) dialog: Tell her that you love her.
88) 10) dialog: Even better — you've got nothing to lose - and you’1l always regret it if you don’t. I never told your Mum enough — I should have told her every day ~ because she was perfect every day. You've seen the films, kiddo - it ain’t over till it’s over.
88) 17) dialog: That’s okay. My fault.
88) 19) dialog: Yes. Well, step-dad. Daniel.
88) 21) dialog: I agree. Well done, kiddo - though I prefer Chet Baker. DEEP PAUSE. THE TWO ADULTS JUST LOOK AT EACH OTHER.

88) 26) dialog: Yes — well — I hope we’1ll meet again, Karen.
88) 30) dialog: Yes. Good. Merry Christmas. AS THEY WALK AWAY.
88) 32) dialog: What? SAM GESTURES TOWARDS THE WOMAN.
88) 33) dialog: Don’t be such an arse. AND HE LOOKS BACK AT HER — JUST AS SHE LOOKS BACK AT HIM GOING TO HAPPEN...
