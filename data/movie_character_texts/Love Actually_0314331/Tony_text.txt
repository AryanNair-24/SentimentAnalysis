7) 3) dialog: Why’s that?
7) 5) dialog: I think it’s crap, Colin. People are the same the world over — wherever you go, you'll still be dull and ugly — and girls will still hate you. (CONTINUED)
7) 9) dialog: You don’t have a cute British accent.
7) 11) dialog: Don’t act on this whim, Colin. You’re a lonely, ugly arsehole, and you must accept it.
7) 15) dialog: See...
12) 3) dialog: What?
12) 5) dialog: No!
12) 9) dialog: No!
12) 11) dialog: No, Col! There ARE a few babes in America, I grant you, but they’re already going out with rich guys. You’11 just end up ina dingy bar snogging someone who’s the spitting image of your Mum. And that’s not nice. I should know. I’ve tried it.
12) 13) dialog: That is total bollocks. You’ve actually gone mad now.
12) 15) dialog: NO! NO! I mean it - no, Colin - no-ho-ho!
24) 16) dialog: Judy ~— could you, ahm, take the top off this time — lighting and camera need to know when we're actually going to see the nipples and when we’re not - you know, shadows and things.
24) 19) dialog: Unfortunately we're going to have to hurry. We need to shoot the actors before lunch.
24) 24) dialog: And Jerry says, could you just put your hands on her breasts... HE DOES SO. And massage them, please.
25) 3) dialog: My mistake — sorry, guys, it’s all to do with the effect of light on flesh and all that. Jerry would like absolutely everything off.
25) 5) dialog: Yeh.
25) 18) dialog: And, Judy, if you could just cheat the nipples a little left and down, please.
25) 21) dialog: All right, everyone - that’s a wrap for the stand-ins - the actors are on their way down.
32) 4) dialog: What are you doing here?
32) 6) dialog: You’re not actually going ahead with this genuinely stupid plan?
32) 8) dialog: But I’ve only got one bed.
47) 5) dialog: Okay, stop there. Give Judy a coat someone.
51) 4) dialog: You’11 come back a broken man.
51) 11) dialog: All American girls look exactly like Jabba the Hutt.
58) 10) dialog: Come on, guys, keep it together - concentrate. We’re almost out of time.
58) 14) dialog: (INTERRUPTING) Okay, that’s it. Coats on the stand-ins. Get ready for the actors.
67) 3) dialog: Excellent. Excellent. Perfect. Hold it there.
67) 10) dialog: And if you could just lean back for the orgasm now please, Judy.
100) 6) dialog: O just waiting for a friend ~ what about you guys...?
100) 23) dialog: Hello, Harriet.
100) 26) dialog: 0, you know - bit of this, bit of that. Bit lonely actually.
100) 30) dialog: Well, I suppose so ~ though you know it’1l have to be on the couch, I’ve just got the one bed...
100) 32) dialog: What?
100) 34) dialog: (NOT VERY HAPPY) Ah... AND HARRIET GESTURES BACKWARDS — COMING THROUGH THE CUSTO THE FIFTH STAGGERING AND FAMOUS AMERICAN WOMAN. WE’LL CAL CARLA...
100) 36) dialog: O right.
100) 38) dialog: Yes, I am... Tony... Clopton. Hi.
100) 40) dialog: Yes, well, welcome to England. Looking forward to having you stay. No rush to leave. I hope you’1l be happy with the sleeping arrangements. So... America was..?
