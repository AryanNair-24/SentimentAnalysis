4) 56) dialog: Are you okay? Let me help you! 12.
4) 62) dialog: Wow... My name's Julie.
4) 72) dialog: Give me those, ape. Help him up.
4) 75) dialog: Hey Josh, a busload of us are headed over to Maracas to protest Noxon 24 and pelt Ricky Coogan with cow shit.
4) 79) dialog: Us? You're with him?
4) 84) dialog: Sure.
5) 5) dialog: 
5) 16) dialog: I'll say! What a total piece of shit. Don't you think so, Josh?
5) 22) dialog: And what a lousy actor! I mean can you believe that "Hey Dude" crap? 14.
5) 28) dialog: Well, he's no Christian Slater.
6) 6) dialog: You don't even want to hear the truth about Noxon, do you, Coogan?
6) 9) dialog: I mean, look, I'm not saying this stuff is going to turn anyone into a... a...
6) 17) dialog: Right. A human worm. I mean, that's just stupid. The point is--
6) 22) dialog: Yeah, or a dog boy. That's absurd.
6) 28) dialog: Okay, okay. Now you're just being silly. Human suffering's just a big joke to you, huh? You are sick, Coogan!
6) 31) dialog: Cool! A freak show! Let's check it out!
8) 5) dialog: Isn't it great? It's so "real"...
8) 21) dialog: I'm Julie. And you are...
8) 29) dialog: We'd like to see your freak show. You see, only by appreciating the variety and innovation of nature can we come to respect the fragile complexity of our global eco- system.
8) 43) dialog: 
8) 51) dialog: Oh, just our luck...
8) 61) dialog: The sideshow tradition has been misrepresented by the media. You don't traffic in human misery. You show society the part of itself it doesn't want to look at. 19.
9) 25) dialog: My God! He's using Noxon Twenty- Four!
9) 39) dialog: Wait a minute. Does this mean we're not going to see a show?
9) 52) dialog: Go screw yourself!
9) 75) dialog: Oh God!... No!... Holy shit!
9) 87) dialog: 
9) 92) dialog: 
9) 97) dialog: Pig!
9) 103) dialog: Mother always said there'd be days like this. And I thought she was nuts!
16) 7) dialog: Are you alright?
16) 13) dialog: What!? Oh sure, blame the woman. Typical.
16) 28) dialog: Oh geez... It's not so (GULP) revolting. After all, physical beauty is just a socially-enforced myth that we, uh, oh shit... ULPI
16) 42) dialog: (walks up to them) Kind of the "top dog."
16) 116) dialog: Don't be an idiot.
16) 134) dialog: All the freaks have gone through this anguish, Rick. At first, I was blinded by my anger. I admit it. I wanted to break your neck for getting me into this. But I got over it. Juan taught me to channel my anger for the common good.
16) 138) dialog: 
16) 148) dialog: Here. Take it.
16) 155) dialog: we're in cubicle eight. Maybe later you'll be ready to talk.
31) 58) dialog: 
31) 64) dialog: How many?
31) 68) dialog: Oaf!
32) 30) dialog: Juan's plan is really ingenious Rick. See, he figured out that--
32) 49) dialog: Rick, wait.
32) 53) dialog: This isn't one of your dumb movies, Coogan. Look, Juan's a good dog, a smart dog. I'll talk to him. Don't be stupid, Rick. You can't do it without us.
34) 120) dialog: (to the others) Come on. You heard the Beast Boy. Back to the Freak House, now.
36) 20) dialog: 
36) 29) dialog: Oh Rick, you've touched a place in me no one has ever touched before.
37) 21) dialog: But it's made for a woman!
37) 24) dialog: Hey Rick. What's up?
37) 29) dialog: "Tape Donahue... Renew Subscription to Beaver World..." Eeuw!
37) 39) dialog: "Prepare demonstration for Laughing Man, receive five thousand barrels of Noxon." Five thousand barrels!?
38) 51) dialog: Yes! Exactly! If they've been using Noxon 24 as a fertilizer here, the entire ecosystem must be soaked with it! All we need is a way to extract it from the vegetation, ideally into a liquid form.
38) 57) dialog: 
40) 11) dialog: Wow! 68.
40) 28) dialog: Stooge!
43) 3) dialog: I hate when you do that.
43) 8) dialog: It's a dog!
43) 32) dialog: Look, a wood floor.
45) 10) dialog: (whispers to Rick) PMS...
45) 27) dialog: But how? You didn't even use the Noxon.
45) 35) dialog: Hang on, Rick. Do you really think we should put this toxic glop on you? What if it doesn't work? What if something goes wrong? What
45) 50) dialog: Sometimes seven fifty.
45) 58) dialog: No kidding. When you consider money for parking, popcorn, drinks... 74.
53) 3) dialog: Here it comes.
53) 39) dialog: 
53) 52) dialog: Rick! Come on!
63) 47) dialog: Oh, Rick...
67) 49) dialog: Rick! It's finally over! 103.
67) 75) dialog: Well, now it really is over.
67) 87) dialog: Oh, shut up. (She turns to Rick) Let's go fuck.
