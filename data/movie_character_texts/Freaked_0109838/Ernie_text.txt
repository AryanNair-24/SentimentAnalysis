2) 10) dialog: Ladies! All I wanted was a manicure! Yah-ha-ha! (he sees Rick)
2) 26) dialog: Stuey Gluck!
2) 50) dialog: Quick, down here.
3) 22) dialog: Nah, you can have 'em.
4) 5) dialog: It is?
4) 22) dialog: Jesus! We better find the limo before these whale kissers chop us up and sell us for parts. (he spots the limo) There it is.
4) 33) dialog: Let's go, Rick. They're waitin'.
4) 37) dialog: Coog, those hippies'll tear us apart.
4) 43) dialog: He says the pants don't usually come off for less than two-fifty, but since you're so cute, he'll make an exception.
4) 67) dialog: Mother Theresa. Glad to meet you.
4) 70) dialog: Ow! Hey!
5) 11) dialog: Hey Julie. You know I'm kind of an idea man myself. Like, let's say there's a nuclear war, and the only two people left are you and the Pope... Would you pork him?
5) 14) dialog: But one thing's for sure. That Coogan guy sure is an asshole, huh?
5) 39) dialog: 
6) 36) dialog: Lighten up, Coog, could be a goof.
8) 10) dialog: Yeah. Where are all the weirdos?
8) 35) dialog: Hey! What the--
8) 58) dialog: Yeah. We really must be--
8) 68) dialog: What the heck. We'll see some pickled dog brains, maybe some pictures of women with, you know, added equipment.
8) 73) dialog: What the hell, Coog, these people are weird, but they seem nice enough.
9) 50) dialog: (points at Julie) Ladies first!
9) 54) dialog: If I were you, I would!
9) 66) dialog: Wait a second. You're really gonna smear that stuff on us and mutate our body parts!?
9) 70) dialog: Well... then could you give me a really big rodney?
9) 75) dialog: Oh God!... No!... Holy shit!
9) 87) dialog: 
9) 95) dialog: Well, at least I'll never have to go far for a piece of tail.
9) 100) dialog: Ouch! I was just trying to keep things light. Oh God! Why me!?
16) 5) dialog: Over here, Coog.
16) 18) dialog: Chill out, Coog. You're talking to the original tag team of ugly pukes. Step into the light.
16) 24) dialog: 
16) 114) dialog: Call me old-fashioned, but I'll go with Paul Lynde.
16) 131) dialog: Okay Coog, so I get twenty four hour access to T `n' A, and you look like a plate of rancid giblets. We're still pals, right?
16) 145) dialog: Oh... Sorry, Coog. For a second there, I was a total man-hater. Weird.
25) 8) dialog: Sorry. 38.
31) 58) dialog: 
31) 62) dialog: Hey Julie, how many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
31) 66) dialog: Two. One to screw it in and one to ride my Rodney! Ha-ha-ha!
32) 14) dialog: Hey, shouldn't you tell Rick about your big escape plan?
32) 17) dialog: Well, excuse me for living.
32) 38) dialog: You gotta admit, Coog, it's a helluva trick.
32) 51) dialog: Yeah. Don't go off half-cocked. Believe me, it ain't all it's cracked up to be.
32) 59) dialog: I'm getting a bad feeling here.
34) 113) dialog: 
34) 123) dialog: Not again.
37) 19) dialog: It says it's strong enough for a man!
37) 32) dialog: (interested, muffled) Beaver World!?
38) 46) dialog: But you need Noxon 24 to make the freaking sludge, and Elijah told us himself he's run out of it.
40) 18) dialog: It's my Aunt Gladys!
40) 21) dialog: And that's me at my bar mitzvah!
40) 25) dialog: Wait, you gotta see the ones from sleep-away camp! They're hilarious!
43) 6) dialog: Hey! Do you hear that?
45) 3) dialog: Shit. I can't see a damn thing.
45) 7) dialog: Don't push me, Coog. I got a real short fuse today. I'm cranky, bloated, got a wicked case of cramps. Don't ask why. 72.
45) 23) dialog: Hey! It's working!
45) 38) dialog: If it does work, do you think there'll be enough left over to give me a monster size rodney?
45) 48) dialog: Seven bucks.
45) 54) dialog: Sure it does. They don't let you into the theater if you don't pay the price of the ticket.
51) 8) dialog: Somebody's comin'! Hurry.
53) 13) dialog: 
65) 59) dialog: No way! The skull cracker is an illegal move!
66) 13) dialog: Atta' boy Coog!
67) 73) dialog: Oh, like that wasn't totally predictable.
67) 83) dialog: Right, Coog. I learned somethin' too. That men and women truly are equals. That the human spirit transcends gender and physical appearance, and thus it is immune to the petty degradations men may devise. I believe it was Moliere
