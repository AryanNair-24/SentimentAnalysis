1) 0) text: A bedroom stuck in the 1970's. Felt wallpaper, cigarette smoke stains, thick dust. Pictures everywhere of a MAN (VINCENT) and a WOMAN (SANDY) in love. They couldn’t look happier. Young, full of life. On the bed, a Russian woman with a tortured Brooklyn accent, DAKA, rides on top of someone we’1ll soon meet. Daka is lost in her 30s, rough, tattooed, too much makeup, and somewhere underneath it all...beautiful. Furthermore, she’s pregnant. Who knows how long, she’s so damn skinny. Grinding away.
11) 2) dialog: “I think I’m Jewish.” More laughs. Oliver takes a seat in front of his locker.
16) 0) text: Oliver’s dialing a number, when FOUR KIDS ON SKATEBOARDS round the corner. It’s Ozinski, Brooklyn and TWO OTHER PUNKS. Oliver turns his back. That won’t work. They wheel right up.
16) 2) dialog: You live in this neighborhood? Oliver doesn’t talk.
17) 2) dialog: I got a band-aid. 39. Oliver does the unimaginable: he swings at Ozinski. Well, rather, he slaps him in the face. Ozinski barely moves.
17) 4) dialog: He just slapped you. Oliver tries to run. Brooklyn slides his skateboard under him, and the little guy goes flying to the pavement. Ozinski rolls up. Wheelies his board, pins Oliver's chest.
