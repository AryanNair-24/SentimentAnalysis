10) 0) text: Gym class. Oliver’s straining with all his might, trying to do a sit-up. A PARTNER holds his feet. On the mat next to him, ROBERT OZINSKI, the school bully reps through sit-ups like a rabid Marine. COACH MITCHELL blows the whistle, asks the PARTNERS for the count. Oliver’s Partner holds up one finger.
10) 3) dialog: Time. All right. Good job, kiddos. Ozinski drops to the floor.
10) 4) dialog: We're done. Exodus towards the lockers. Coach Mitchell taps Oliver, who’s still hell-bent on getting his chin to that bar. It’s not going to happen.
10) 5) dialog: You can let go now. Oliver looks down at the drop. He’s chicken shit. Coach grabs him by the back, lowers him like a feather.
10) 7) dialog: You have PE at your last school?
10) 9) dialog: Did you take it?
10) 11) dialog: Go get changed. Oliver walks away, in the wrong direction.
10) 12) dialog: The other way. Those doors. He stops, looks. Changes direction.
11) 5) dialog: You guys hear that bell? Silence.
11) 6) dialog: That means get moving. Shuffling.
11) 7) dialog: Go on. Get to class. They're off.
11) 8) dialog: (to Oliver) You need a map? Oliver nods.
11) 10) dialog: Double time it or you'll be late. Oliver nods. Coach walks off. He opens his locker. It’s empty. His pants, uniform...everything’s gone.
