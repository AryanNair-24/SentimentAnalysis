1) 0) text: A bedroom stuck in the 1970's. Felt wallpaper, cigarette smoke stains, thick dust. Pictures everywhere of a MAN (VINCENT) and a WOMAN (SANDY) in love. They couldn’t look happier. Young, full of life. On the bed, a Russian woman with a tortured Brooklyn accent, DAKA, rides on top of someone we’1ll soon meet. Daka is lost in her 30s, rough, tattooed, too much makeup, and somewhere underneath it all...beautiful. Furthermore, she’s pregnant. Who knows how long, she’s so damn skinny. Grinding away.
1) 2) dialog: (puffing a cigarette) You didn’t eat?
1) 4) dialog: How do you forget to eat?

1) 9) dialog: Bastards have a pill for everything. That’s a fact, lady. Killing us all, ten milligrams at a time. Vincent sifts through his pill pouch. Pulls out a dozen or so...the day’s dose.
1) 10) dialog: Where’s the water? Didn’t I ask for water?
1) 12) dialog: Coming here twenty years, still can’t get their shit together. Calling off to a Mexican server (JESUS.)
1) 13) dialog: Jesus. Aqua. Pills. Jesus smiles, nods.
1) 15) dialog: Just crack and meth. That’s a better plan.
1) 19) dialog: Can you put more ice in it? I want to make sure I choke while I’m swallowing my poison. Jesus is confused.
1) 22) dialog: Yeah. Oh, si. Just like everyday I come in here. Aqua no hielo. No one really knows what to say. They've heard it all before. Daily.
1) 24) dialog: Uno momento. Vin takes a pill, swallows.
1) 25) dialog: What did Jesus say to the Mexicans before he left?
1) 27) dialog: Don’t do anything till I get back. Daka doesn’t laugh.
1) 29) dialog: Really. From you? Vin takes another pill. Swallows.
2) 1) dialog: (pointing) That one there. Says the line’s been frozen. Terry shuffles.
2) 3) dialog: Don’t need a financial seminar. I own the damn thing outright. 40 years.

2) 7) dialog: You do stand-up? Vin rises.
2) 8) dialog: This is my life here, pal. I need that money.
2) 10) dialog: Everybody's says that now. You know what it means, “You're fucked, and will remain fucked.” He walks off.
2) 14) dialog: I want to close this account.
2) 16) dialog: Lady. You're just a spoke on a wheel, trying to make a living like the rest of us schmucks. I don’t want to tell you to go fuck yourself. Let’s just leave it at that.
2) 19) dialog: Small bills.
2) 21) dialog: What’s that mean?
2) 23) dialog: I know what overdrawn means.
2) 28) dialog: What’s what?
2) 30) dialog: I’m a little tight right now. You know I’m good for it. Daka looks him over.
2) 33) dialog: See you next week.
3) 2) dialog: (slurring) Best Christmas I ever had. No people. No presents. No bullshit. Just celebrating the birth of the baby Jesus. Tips his tumbler to heaven.
3) 4) dialog: What do you know what I mean, Linda? You a psychic now?
3) 6) dialog: You should get a talk show. You’re so damn good at it. The “Linda and Gus Just Fucking Talking Talk Show.” Vin flags the bartender, ROGER.
3) 7) dialog: Rog. Another Maker's. Roger steps over.
3) 9) dialog: Give what a break?
3) 11) dialog: You're not gonna serve me?
3) 13) dialog: You know how much money I’ve spent in this dump over the years? Roger tries to keep it smooth.
3) 15) dialog: Watching out for me? Vin stands, wobbles. He’s drunker than even he realized.
3) 16) dialog: You serve poison to people everyday. So they can die while they’re alive. Now you’re watching out...is that right? Gus stands, tries to help Vin.
3) 18) dialog: Don’t touch me, Gus. Do not touch me. I will drive home drunk like I’ve done every night Roger here’s been watching out for me. Vin pushes free, walks to the door.
3) 19) dialog: Happy New Year. He’s out. EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER The Spider whips into the driveway. Hits the picket fence on the neighbor's border. Crash. It topples. Hits his own mailbox on the other side. Crash. It flies onto the lawn. He puts the top up. Vin shuts the car off. Sits for a minute. Then steps out and swerves to the toppled mailbox. Gets on all fours, opens the door, gets the mail...pounds of it.
3) 21) dialog: There you are. Where’d you go tonight, ha? You out catting around... He rubs the cat all over. His only love.
3) 22) dialog: I bet you’re hungry, aren’t you? He takes Felix in his arms, shuffles to the kitchen.
3) 24) dialog: UGHHHH. Shit. AHHHH. Vin stumbles with the pain. His foot gets ever so close to an ice chip on the tile floor... Slip. Flip. Smack. Vin flies up in the air, lands on the floor. Crack! His head hits the tile hard. He’s out. Or dead. 10. Felix looks at his owner. Jumps down beside him. Laps up some blood.
4) 4) dialog: Shut up out there. People are sleeping. He groans. Holds himself up. Felix the Cat stares from a safe distance. Vin sees the blood.
4) 5) dialog: Ah, piss. He feels his face, and for the first time we see it: he looks like a prize fighter after the twelfth round. 11. A gash above his eye is the origin of the blood. It probably needs stitches. He’1ll never get them. Vin sits there for a second, collects himself. EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Vin walks outside, searching for the commotion. He shields the sun from his eyes. The fighting Movers are still at it.
4) 6) dialog: Hey! Hey! What’s the problem? This is a neighborhood. People are sleeping. The Movers stop. Stare.
4) 7) dialog: You comprende?! Nothing.
4) 8) dialog: Habla English?
4) 10) dialog: What the hell are you doing here? Vin looks up, notices the tree ripped.
4) 11) dialog: What the?!? That’s my tree you assholes hit?! There's a large tree limb sitting on Vin’s car and across the fence (which he knocked down last night.)
4) 12) dialog: And my fence! My damn car!?! Silence. VINCENT (CONT’D) Do you speak English!?! Just then a car pulls up, parks in front of the house. A WOMAN in her late thirties steps out. This is MAGGIE, Vin’s new neighbor. She'd be prettier if she weren’t always so worried.
4) 13) dialog: I’m calling the cops. Vin heads inside. 12.
4) 15) dialog: What do you want?
4) 17) dialog: So.
4) 19) dialog: I noticed that. These dipshits with you?
4) 22) dialog: Oh, shit...more like it. That fence is twenty years old. The car’s forty. And the tree’s older than me.
4) 25) dialog: Of course, they did it. What are you stupid? Look at the scene. Maggie doesn’t take kindly to being called stupid.
4) 27) dialog: Accidents happen. What’re you a fucking adjuster? Maggie puts her arm around Oliver.
4) 29) dialog: That car’s an antique, missy. Worth a lot of money. She looks at the car. More like a piece of shit.
4) 31) dialog: You. You don’t have any money. No offense. You don’t look like you do. And I'll bet Chico and the Man over there are “off the books.” No, thank you, blondie, I’1l sue the moving company. Vin walks off.
4) 32) dialog: You can buck up for the tree and the fence. He hits the front door. Oliver looks up at his mom.
9) 3) dialog: Come on. Come on. Dig in. The horses fly around the track.
9) 4) dialog: Dig. One time. One damn time. And just like that, Vincent’s horse...loses.
9) 5) dialog: Son of a bitch. He crumples up his race form. Throws it on the floor. It lands at a MAN’S FEET.
9) 7) dialog: Yeah. Rough day. Zaucko sits. Takes a pull of Vin’s Maker's.
9) 8) dialog: Help yourself.
9) 10) dialog: I don’t have it right now, kid. Got a situation I’m working out.
9) 12) dialog: I just need a little time, you know. 20.
9) 14) dialog: A month.
9) 16) dialog: I always pay, don’t I? Zucko hits Vin’s Makers again.
11) 15) dialog: Take me, God. Don’t play with me. Oliver steps forward, down the walk.
11) 17) dialog: Yeah. What?
11) 19) dialog: My phone?
11) 21) dialog: In my house?
11) 23) dialog: For what?
11) 25) dialog: I don’t need the whole story. Vin stares at the little shit. Pulls himself up off the lawn.
11) 26) dialog: One call. Vin walks away. Oliver walks across the lawn and through the demolished fence into Vin’s yard. 25. INT. VIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Oliver’s on an old rotary phone in the kitchen. Vin’s fixing a Maker’s Mark in the background. Ring. Ring. Ring. Voicemail.
11) 29) dialog: Vincent.
11) 31) dialog: What’s your name?
11) 33) dialog: Don’t you think it’s a little cold for shorts?
11) 35) dialog: I’m sure it is. Silence. 26.

11) 39) dialog: Yes.
12) 4) dialog: Your kid’s here.
12) 6) dialog: Is what all right?
12) 8) dialog: Stays here. Like what, stays here?
12) 10) dialog: You want me to baby-sit? 27.
12) 13) dialog: What’re you paying?
12) 15) dialog: For baby-sitting. I’m not a philanthropy.
12) 17) dialog: Twelve. Maggie is amazed.
12) 19) dialog: Hey. It’s for you. Oliver walks to the phone, picks it up.
12) 21) dialog: He doesn’t like many people.
12) 23) dialog: Yeah. He doesn’t usually like people who say they’re good with animals. 28. Oliver laughs at the movie. It’s rare.
12) 24) dialog: You've never seen Abbott & Costello?
12) 26) dialog: No. They’re dead. That’s the oldest you can be.
12) 28) dialog: Where’d you learn that?
12) 30) dialog: What book?
12) 32) dialog: It’s dinner time. You hungry or something? Oliver looks at Vin, studies his face.
12) 34) dialog: That figures. KITCHEN - VIN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Vin’s scouring the kitchen, looking for something to feed the kid. All he finds is a tin of sardines and a package of Saltines. He cracks the sardines open. Arranges like it’s sushi. Decorates a dirty plate with concentric circles of sardines and stale crackers. Not bad. 29.
12) 36) dialog: Probably your mother.
12) 38) dialog: I guess I’ll get that.
12) 42) dialog: Yep. He doesn’t instinctively let her in.
12) 44) dialog: I don’t need the whole story.
12) 47) dialog: Thirty six. 30.
12) 49) dialog: I don’t have change. Of course. Really.
12) 51) dialog: Where's his father? That’s personal.
12) 53) dialog: Don’t worry about it then. A beat. We hear Oliver laughing in the background. Maggie smiles.
12) 54) dialog: How come you don’t have anyone to watch this kid after school?
12) 56) dialog: I was there.
12) 58) dialog: You gonna pay for my fence?
12) 60) dialog: And the tree?
12) 62) dialog: Everything has a price. You're an adult, you should know that.
12) 64) dialog: I‘ll figure out something fair. A beat.
12) 66) dialog: I can the watch the kid too. After school for a few hours. Same price. Maggie is speechless.
12) 67) dialog: I‘1l1 do eleven bucks an hour if you supply the snacks. Little shit ate my last can of sardines. INT. MAGGIE & OLIVER’S HOUSE - LATER Maggie and Oliver sit at a tiny round table, kitchen. Oliver is chowing down on a frozen

13) 11) dialog: Cowards. Try to sell me something, go ahead. He hangs up. Moseys back.
13) 18) dialog: What!?
13) 21) dialog: I’m gonna wait till you give your whole spiel before I hang up. Maggie has no idea how to respond.
13) 23) dialog: Who is this?
13) 25) dialog: Maggie? That’s a good one.
13) 27) dialog: Who? Oh. What the hell do you want?
14) 1) dialog: Better buckle up.
14) 3) dialog: My life is my problem. Oliver buckles.
14) 5) dialog: No. Then...
14) 6) dialog: Let’s lay down some S.O.P. here.
14) 8) dialog: Standard Operating Procedure. You go where I go. Do what I say. Get your homework done somewhere along the way. And most importantly, don’t annoy me. I’m not happy when I’m annoyed.
14) 10) dialog: Not particularly.
15) 1) dialog: Here’s a quarter. Call your mom, tell her you’re wearing your seat belt.
15) 3) dialog: Since when.
15) 5) dialog: What’s wrong with this country. Vin digs some more change out of the ashtray. 38.
15) 6) dialog: If it’s more than that, call collect. Vin's out, to the 7-Eleven.
17) 6) dialog: What’re you little shit heels doing? They turn to see Vincent, holding a tire iron.
17) 7) dialog: That you Robert Ozinski?
17) 9) dialog: Bullshit, you little prick. You’re Reesa’s kid. Reesa Ozinski. I recognize you from your fat Polish nose. Vin walks towards them.
17) 10) dialog: Just like your prick father’s nose. Guess the apple doesn’t fall too far from the rotten tree. Vin lights a cigarette.
17) 11) dialog: I got a deal for you little bully shits. Whatever you do to the little guy there...I’m going to all of your mothers. Vin smashes a skateboard with the tire iron. It shatters.
17) 12) dialog: Ride this! 40. Scared to shit, the four haul-ass out of there. VINCENT (CONT’D) Get on, pencil dicks! Vin walks up to Oliver. Looks down at him. Offers his hand. Oliver hesitates.
17) 13) dialog: You need a paper invitation? Oliver takes his hand. Vin pulls him up to his feet, heads to the car. INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS Driving.
17) 14) dialog: Who taught you...how to slap?
17) 16) dialog: Well, you should unlearn that. Vin lights a cigarette.
17) 18) dialog: To what?
17) 20) dialog: Your father never taught you how to take care of yourself?
17) 22) dialog: Kid, this country wasn’t founded by tree huggers. That’s for sure. You gotta stand up for yourself or you get mowed down.
17) 24) dialog: So was Hitler.
17) 26) dialog: Indeed. Making a point though, fella. Small means nothing. It’s what you got in here. Vin points to his head.
19) 2) dialog: When we get in there, don’t talk.
19) 4) dialog: How about you practice not talking now. Vin turns a corner.
19) 7) dialog: Good to see you, Sandy. 42. Vin puts his doctor’s bag on the foot of her bed, digs in it. VINCENT (CONT’D) How're we feeling?
19) 9) dialog: Okay. Well, happy birthday. (to Oliver) Put that stuff in the drawers over there. Oliver complies.
19) 10) dialog: Let’s see what the old ticker sounds like. Vin moves bedside, puts the stethoscope to Sandy’s chest.
19) 12) dialog: You bet, Sandy.
20) 2) dialog: That’s the plan. It’s not.
20) 4) dialog: Nope. 43. Sandy looks Oliver over.
20) 6) dialog: Sure.
20) 8) dialog: I don’t know.
20) 11) dialog: Gives me something to do. Vin hands the laundry off to Oliver.
20) 13) dialog: He’s twelve bucks an hour.
20) 16) dialog: She doesn’t like the green beans.
20) 18) dialog: She always liked broccoli. Broccoli's good. Vin walks off. Oliver catches up.
20) 19) text: INT. VINCENT’S GARAGE - LATER Oliver’s standing in a fight stance across from Vin, who’s wearing a bandana, holding a Maker’s Mark in one hand while leaning against a hanging heavy bag. Oliver punches the bag. It’s like a butterfly kiss.
20) 20) dialog: That's just going to get you beat up real bad.
20) 22) dialog: No one wants to fight, kid. You think I wanted to go to war? You think an eighteen year old wants to sit in a rice paddy while bullets are screaming past his ears on both sides?
20) 24) dialog: Vietnam.
20) 26) dialog: No, I’m imagining it. Vincent steps back, thinks. VINCENT (CONT’D) All right. I’11 teach you one thing, it’s probably the only hope you got. If you do it right, you'll break his nose with one shot. Oliver is rattled.
20) 28) dialog: Relax, you won’t do it right.
21) 7) dialog: I’m working up an estimate on the fence. And we’re looking at three hundred on the tree. Not gonna negotiate with myself.
21) 9) dialog: That’s nice for you. Working for a living. Rough out there. In the den, we find Oliver asleep on the couch. Felix the Cat is curled up on top of him.
21) 11) dialog: I wasn’t offering a rebate. 46. Maggie scoops up a sleeping Oliver. VINCENT (CONT’D) What you been crying about? It's very obvious that Maggie’s been bawling.
21) 13) dialog: ‘Kay. What’s the punchline?
21) 15) dialog: There goes my job security. Maggie smiles.
21) 16) dialog: That could've gone either way.
22) 1) dialog: Who pissed in your Cheerios?
22) 3) dialog: That a surprise?
22) 5) dialog: The self-employed racket is a tough road, I’'ll say that. 47.
22) 7) dialog: I think you have case.
22) 9) dialog: Nowhere near what he’s gonna cost ya.
22) 11) dialog: It’s a she?

22) 48) dialog: Let him in.
22) 51) dialog: (a tinge of pride) You broke his nose.
22) 53) dialog: You must have hit it just right. Let me see. 52. Oliver demonstrates: the hand position, the stance.
22) 55) dialog: He’s a runt. Needs to learn how to defend himself. Daka stands, had enough.
22) 57) dialog: It’s on the dresser.
22) 59) dialog: It’s all there. Minus the deductible. Daka walks off.
22) 62) dialog: A lady of the night.
22) 64) dialog: One of the more honest ways to make a living.
23) 1) dialog: The board tells you what the day’s action looks like. Race number. Who’s running, riding, so forth.
23) 3) dialog: Odds. Some bookie outta Vegas thinks that horse has a one in twenty chance of winning.
23) 5) dialog: Twenty times your money.
23) 7) dialog: If you win. Sure.
23) 9) dialog: (re: a horse) That one there with the wraps...is The kid is fast. a dog.
23) 11) dialog: The odds of him winning are astronomical.
23) 13) dialog: Don’t get ahead of yourself.
23) 16) dialog: You see what I’m doing here?
23) 18) dialog: Praying?
23) 20) dialog: I thought we talked about talking. Vin opens his eyes. Annoyed. Oliver could care.
23) 22) dialog: You pick three horses to finish 1-2- 3, in the order they come in. High risk, high reward.
23) 24) dialog: If you’re gonna gamble, you might as well have the chance to win big. Oliver scans the form, thinks.
23) 26) dialog: How much money you got? Oliver un-Velcros his wallet.
23) 28) dialog: Lunch money?
23) 30) dialog: You might as well learn the hard way. Vin pulls some cash from his wallet. Stands.
23) 31) dialog: I'll go in with you. That’s called mitigation. They're off to the betting window. 55.
23) 34) dialog: Roll with it, kid. Without missing a beat, Oliver throws his hands in the air. Tosses his race form.
23) 36) dialog: Son-of-a-bitch. Vin kicks his chair, walks off. Oliver follows.
23) 38) dialog: (under ) Ease up there.
24) 1) dialog: Your mom can’t know about this.
24) 4) dialog: Not if she knows where it came from.
24) 6) dialog: Well. I don’t want. Let’s not go there.
24) 10) dialog: Kind of you to remember. Need to open up a savings account for my grandson here. Terry has a seat. Vin slides a stack of cash across the desk.
24) 12) dialog: And this'll get my account back to zero. Close me out, while you’re tapping away there. Vin smiles a fuck you at him.
24) 13) dialog: (to Oliver) Don’t grow up to be a pencil pusher, kiddo. They’re spineless. 57.
25) 2) dialog: You want another?
25) 4) dialog: Go for it. We’re living today. Oliver calls out weakly to the bartender (Roger.)
25) 6) dialog: You kids. Damn small talkers. No point in yapping if nobody's listening. Let’s hear it. Oliver belts out.
25) 8) dialog: Can't get nothing in this life without being heard. Roger walks over.
25) 10) dialog: You can hit me while you’re at it there to, Rog. Roger knows Vin is wasted. Vin digs process. drink. 58.
25) 12) dialog: Don’t lie to me, Roger. Be a man.
25) 14) dialog: We're going to find another place to our spend money.
25) 16) dialog: Turncoats. Everywhere you look. No loyalty anymore. Everyone taking care of themselves in the old U.S. of A. That’s why we’re falling apart. Vin drains his wet ice, then smashes his glass on the bar. It shatters. His hand is ripped open.
25) 18) dialog: Just a cut, pal. I’ve had a lot of them. Vin gets woozy, leans into Oliver.
25) 19) dialog: Let’s get you home, kiddo. Got homework to do. He passes out. EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER A taxi pulls into the driveway. The headlights illuminate a very pissed off Maggie, standing on Vin’s lawn. Vin and Oliver climb out of the car. Vin’s hand is bandaged. 59.
25) 23) dialog: It broke down.
25) 25) dialog: This is gonna be fun.
25) 28) dialog: He should starve?
25) 33) dialog: We'll see.
25) 35) dialog: Mentioned something like that. 60.
25) 37) dialog: If you haven’t noticed...you’re not home much. Kinda hard to have a conversation with someone who’s not there.
25) 39) dialog: I didn’t sign on for hormones here, deary. That’1ll cost you 15 bucks an hour.
25) 41) dialog: What do you know about me? Really? Tell me. I’d love it. Vin stops. Maggie thinks.
25) 43) dialog: If it ain’t broken...
25) 45) dialog: I’m up to 40 hours this week. 41 starts time-and-a-half. He’s gone.
28) 2) dialog: My Sandy, she’s gotta have the best. So, I’1ll just figure this thing out. She hands him a folder: invoices, bills, statements.
28) 4) dialog: I get that. Vin looks inside, just a glance is enough to know he’s fucked.
28) 6) dialog: So, what’s that mean?
28) 8) dialog: Got it.
28) 10) dialog: Tomorrow.
28) 12) dialog: Put her. That’s it. Or we get the boot?
28) 14) dialog: What is the best way to phrase it?
29) 2) dialog: Yep. Vin parks in front of their bench.
29) 4) dialog: At the garden store. Sandy laughs. Touches his hand.
29) 6) dialog: Sandy. A beat. Sandy looks confused.
29) 7) dialog: It’s me, babe. Vin. And just like that, she’s gone.
30) 1) dialog: It’s a lot lighter.
30) 3) dialog: Easier on my back. Vin reaches into his pocket, pulls out some cash. A few wrinkled bills. He hands them to Ana.
30) 4) dialog: You think we can get some plants or something for the room.
30) 6) dialog: Mums. Or the like. I’m not a florist. He gets a few more bucks.
30) 7) dialog: Here. For the trouble.
30) 9) dialog: You go way beyond doing your job, Ana. You been an angel for my Sandy. He puts the money in her smock pocket. Ana’s practically blushing.
30) 11) dialog: Deal. I’m shit broke anyway. She laughs on her way out.
30) 13) dialog: Thanks, doll. 67. Ana disappears behind the station. Vin looks at the cabinet on the wall behind the counter: full of meds. He looks around.
31) 2) dialog: Hundred bucks? I pay more than that for one prescription. Daka pulls bottles of meds out of the bag. Names them.
31) 4) dialog: That should have some value.
31) 6) dialog: Five hundred bucks. That stuff is high dollar.
31) 8) dialog: I’1l take the hundred.
32) 2) dialog: I know that. Withdraw from my grandson’s account there. I should be on it. Vin hands her his ID. She doesn’t think anything about it.

The one Vin tossed in the trash. He flips the picture over, reads the handwritten inscription: “la Drang, Vietnam, 1965. Sgt. Vincent Canatella.” Oliver pecks on his keyboard: Insert - Google search bar typing: “Sgt. Vincent Canatella.” The search reveals several pages with headings: “War Hero,” “Bronze Star,” “Sgt. Canatella Rescues Two Officers,” “The Battle of la Drang.” Etc. Oliver clicks on the first link and starts reading. A picture of a younger Vin pops up. He’s a proud looking soldier.

Under Oliver Bornstein, we find: St. William of Rochester and...Vincent Canatella. And he’s one fucked-up looking “saint.” Eyes black, face distorted, assuredly on drugs, lying in his hospital bed.
