28) 0) text: Tacky office. Vin’s sitting across from the rehab director, SHIRLEY JORSTIN, a tight-lipped, tough egg in her 50s.
28) 1) dialog: There’s plenty of affordable health care options, Mr. Canatella. Sunnyside’s pricey. It’s not for everyone.
28) 3) dialog: You’re months behind. We’re not in the credit business, as you know.
28) 5) dialog: So...
28) 7) dialog: We need payment in full and three months in advance.
28) 9) dialog: By tomorrow.
28) 11) dialog: We'll transfer her wherever you decide to put her.
28) 13) dialog: That’s not the best way to phrase what’s happening. 65. Vin stands, pissed.

50) 1) dialog: Mr. Canatella, this is Shirley Jorstin over here at Sunnyside. Sir, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your wife is dead. And she’s been dead for a few weeks now. And we haven’t heard from you. Which is concerning as well. SHIRLEY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER Vin’s sitting at Shirley’s desk. Shirley enters with a box of personal items.
50) 2) dialog: Oookay, Mr. Canatella. Here we go. Shirley sits. Puts the box on her desk.

50) 11) dialog: In the box. Her remains. Vin is speechless. For once.
50) 12) dialog: She died a few weeks ago, Mr. Canatella. We tried to contact you several times. So there’s that. And when we didn’t hear back from you. Well. We just went ahead and followed your death directives, sir. She pushes a signed paper towards, Vin.
50) 13) dialog: You did want her cremated. That’s what’s on the signed directives there. Vin looks at the paper, then back at the box.
50) 15) dialog: Her remains are, sir. Yes. Ina box inside that box. We can’t just keep a body lying around. I’m sure you understand. That would be inappropriate. And legally we just can’t do that, of course. You could imagine the litigation potential. Vin stands. Takes the box.
50) 16) dialog: I’m sorry for your loss, Mr. Canatella. Vin stares at here, then walks away. 89.
50) 17) dialog: There is the other matter of your outstanding balance we should discuss. Vin keeps walking.
