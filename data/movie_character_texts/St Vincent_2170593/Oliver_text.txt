4) 35) dialog: It’s gonna be a long life. INT. MAGGIE & OLIVER’S HOUSE - NIGHT Oliver's bedroom. The room has a bed in it, little else. The evening ritual is in progress: bedtime book time. Although...Oliver is the one reading: “The Giving Tree.” Maggie’s on a beanbag on the floor, nursing a Chardonnay. 14.
4) 36) dialog: (reading) “I wish that I could give you something, but I have nothing left.” I am just an old stump. “I don't need very much now," said the boy. “Just a quiet place to sit and rest. I am very tired." "Well," said the tree, straightening herself up as much as she could, "Well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting. Come, Boy, sit down. Sit down and rest." And the boy did. And the tree was happy. Maggie drinks her wine. She gets
4) 38) dialog: No, it’s not. The old tree was made to give. So to be able to give everything and have nothing left is the best life the tree could ever have. She tucks Oliver into bed. Kisses his forehead.
4) 40) dialog: It’s my first day.
4) 42) dialog: Where’s the bus line?
4) 44) dialog: Night. She turns the light off. Oliver settles into the darkness. 15.

8) 0) text: St. Francis de Sales Catholic School is just like any other middle school. Diverse. Modern. Noisy. Dozens of KIDS crowd the hallways, dig through lockers, socialize with FRIENDS. Oliver can’t open his locker. He tries the combination again...no dice. He looks around for help. No one makes eye contact. The tardy bell chimes. Oliver gives up, drags all his stuff with him. Rushes down the hallway. INT. BROTHER CRESPI’S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER Religious Studies class. Brother Crespi stands in front of THIRTY CHATTY PRETEENS. Crespi’s in his thirties, preppy and full of new teacher idealism. Oliver stands at his side, he could pass out.

Oliver’s Partner holds up one finger.

11) 9) dialog: No, sir.
11) 11) dialog: Shit. EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES —- SIDEWALKS - LATER School's out. KIDS everywhere: jumping in cars, riding bikes, walking home. It's easy to spot Oliver in the crowd, he’s the only student wearing short gym shorts, a tank top and sneakers. 23. As expected, STUDENTS comment, laugh, text, chide. It’s not been a good first day for Oliver. He reaches the crosswalk. Looks up at the street sign, it doesn’t look vaguely familiar. He crosses anyway.
11) 12) dialog: -- Oliver crosses a major Boulevard. Cars everywhere. -- He stops in the middle of a block. Looks around. Then turns and goes back in the direction from wince he came. -- Oliver walks in front of a row of houses. A DOG tears up and jumps on the picket fence, barking. Oliver runs off. -- Oliver reads a street sign. Thinks. Walks on. INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS Vin’s driving through major traffic. He pulls up next to a bus load of PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS. They stare at him. He stares back. The light turns green, the bus pulls off. Then in tandem, the WHOLE WINDOW ROW OF KIDS flip him off. Damn kids. Vin lights a cigarette.
11) 13) dialog: Finally, Oliver recognizes his block. He runs towards what he thinks is his house. Looks...that’s it. He’s home. EXT. MAGGIE & OLIVER’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Oliver, at the front door, reaches into his pocket for the key. Damn. He’s not wearing his pants. His key and phone were in the pockets of his stolen uniform. He could cry. But he’s not the type. He slumps down in resignation and sits on the cold concrete steps. VIN’S DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS Vin’s car pulls in haphazardly. He runs over some of the toppled fence. Curses, with the windows up...so it sounds like Charlie Brown’s parents. Vin climbs out of the car. Walks to the fallen mailbox, lowers himself onto the lawn, pulls mail out until... 24.
11) 14) dialog: Sir? Vin hears something. Stops, looks around. Confused.
11) 16) dialog: It’s me, sir. Vin squints. Finally sees the kid.

11) 28) dialog: Sir...what’s your name?
11) 30) dialog: Vincent. (whispers ) The mean one... The conversation trails. VIN’S LIVING ROOM - LATER Vin’s sitting in his La-Z-Boy, facing Oliver on the couch. Felix the Cat is sitting in Vin’s lap, staring at Oliver. They don’t get much company around here. The silence lasts forever. And ever. A little longer. Then...

11) 37) dialog: Sorry, sir.
12) 12) dialog: Sir? Vin holds up his hand, shushes Oliver.
12) 22) dialog: I’m good with animals, sir.
12) 25) dialog: No, sir. Are they old?
12) 27) dialog: Or the youngest. Time freezes when you die. Hmm.
12) 29) dialog: A book.
12) 31) dialog: A kid's book, sir. I doubt you know it. Little shit. Then...
12) 33) dialog: A little, sir. Vincent looks annoyed. He’s the kind of guy that gets annoyed when someone wants something, even if he offered.
12) 37) dialog: Probably, sir. Oliver doesn’t move.
12) 39) dialog: Thank you, sir. Vin aches his way out of the recliner.
12) 69) dialog: Can we buy some sardines, ma?
12) 71) dialog: Okay.
12) 73) dialog: Who?
12) 75) dialog: He’s interesting. In an old, grouchy sort of way.
12) 78) dialog: He did?
12) 80) dialog: You'll be home though. Right.
12) 82) dialog: I guess he’s too old to be dangerous and not too old to be too dangerous either. If you know what I mean.
12) 84) dialog: Sure. Then...
12) 85) dialog: Ma, are we still Jewish? INT. BROTHER CRESPI’S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS Crespi, teaching.
14) 0) text: School pickup. Oliver’s an ant amongst the THRONGS OF KIDS waiting for a ride home. He’s buried in a book, when Vin’s car putters in. A thorn amongst the black Crossovers. Vin scans the CROWD OF KIDS, spots Oliver. Honks his horn. Way too long. Everyone stares. Oliver looks up. Mortified. INT. VIN’S CAR - LATER Vin’s driving. Oliver’s still recovering. A large basket of clean laundry sits between them.
14) 2) dialog: You’re not buckled.
14) 4) dialog: This the way home? 37.
14) 7) dialog: I don’t know what S.O.P. means, sir.
14) 9) dialog: Are you annoyed right now?
14) 11) dialog: Really. Vin stares at him. Smart ass.
15) 2) dialog: Costs more than a quarter.
15) 4) dialog: Since before I was born.
16) 0) text: Oliver’s dialing a number, when FOUR KIDS ON SKATEBOARDS round the corner. It’s Ozinski, Brooklyn and TWO OTHER PUNKS. Oliver turns his back. That won’t work. They wheel right up.
16) 4) dialog: You probably got detention because you took my stuff.
17) 0) text: Ozinski slams Oliver hard into the payphone. His nose starts bleeding.
17) 5) dialog: Please...that hurts. From around the corner, Vin’s voice.
17) 15) dialog: I don’t know. Just an instinct, I guess.
17) 17) dialog: I'm allergic, sir.
17) 19) dialog: Cigarette smoke. Vin rolls down his window, hangs his cigarette outside. Keeps smoking.
17) 21) dialog: No, sir. He’s a pacifist.
17) 23) dialog: I’m small, if you haven’t noticed. 41.
17) 25) dialog: That’s not a great comparison.
17) 27) dialog: Or here, sir. Oliver points to his heart. Vin looks at the little fella. This kid’s got something.
19) 0) text: Vin and Oliver are walking down the hallway. Oliver's carrying the laundry basket. Vin’s putting on a lab coat, carrying an old-school, leather doctor's bag.

20) 19) text: INT. VINCENT’S GARAGE - LATER Oliver’s standing in a fight stance across from Vin, who’s wearing a bandana, holding a Maker’s Mark in one hand while leaning against a hanging heavy bag. Oliver punches the bag. It’s like a butterfly kiss.
20) 21) dialog: I don’t want to fight anyway.
20) 23) dialog: When was that?
20) 25) dialog: You were there?
20) 27) dialog: Break his nose.
22) 40) dialog: You mother fucking, ass-face, dick bag... He has the wildest, animalistic look in his eyes. And he’s running directly at Ozinski. The entire class is frozen in disbelief...what the hell is he doing?
22) 41) dialog: Asshole, cock sucking, son-of-a- whore... With his hand in a sort of death grip-blow, he hits Ozinski square in the nose...driving his schnoz up into his brain. Splickkkk! Ozinski’s nose explodes with blood. He falls flat backwards, passing out along the way. Thud. Ozinski smacks down on the gym floor. Game over. 51. EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER Oliver runs up to the house, bangs on the front door. Waits. Bangs again. Waits. Finally, Daka opens the door, wearing one of Vin’s old robes.
22) 43) dialog: Who are you?
22) 45) dialog: I’m Oliver.
22) 47) dialog: He’s hard of hearing. Vin screams from within.
22) 52) dialog: Yes, sir. I think so. There was blood everywhere. You should have seen it.
22) 61) dialog: Who is she?
22) 63) dialog: What’s that? Vin lights a cigarette.
23) 0) text: Vin and Oliver are staring up at the betting board.
23) 2) dialog: What’s 20 slash 1? 53.
23) 4) dialog: And what do you get if he does?
23) 6) dialog: That’s a good deal.
23) 10) dialog: Doesn't sound like a compliment.
23) 12) dialog: We should take him across the board.
23) 15) dialog: What’s a-
23) 17) dialog: Praying? 54.

23) 21) dialog: What’s a trifecta?

24) 0) text: Vin’s practically running. Ducking in, out, around and between cars, a plastic shopping bag in his hand. Oliver’s on his tail. INT. VIN’S CAR - LATER A wad of cash sits between the two. $5,600 to be exact.
24) 2) dialog: Exactly. Oliver nods. 56.
24) 3) dialog: She could really use it though.
24) 5) dialog: You keep my half for me? Vin knows that’s not smart.
24) 7) dialog: What am I going to do with it? INT. THE BANK — CONTINUOUS Vin and Oliver sit at the banker’s desk, waiting. Terry strolls up.
25) 0) text: Vin is dancing solo to Steely Dan's, “Do It Again.” He’s wasted. Maker’s in one hand, a smoke in the other. His dance is a bizarre mix of slow-motion Tai Chi moves and yoga poses. In it we see the punch he taught Oliver. From the bar, Oliver watches. Perplexed.
25) 3) dialog: Yes, please.
25) 5) dialog: Excuse me, sir.
25) 7) dialog: Excuse me, sir.

27) 0) text: Detention. Two adjacent bathroom stalls. Oliver’s in one, Ozinski in the other. They’re scrubbing the shitters, floors, walls, et al with scouring pads, toothbrushes. Quiet. Finally Ozinski breaks the silence. 63.
27) 2) dialog: Sorry, can’t hold it.

38) 0) text: Oliver's walking out of the school with Ozinski.

38) 4) dialog: It’s a coming-of-age ceremony. Supposedly a boy becomes a man at that age. Ozinski thinks long and hard. It hurts.
38) 6) dialog: Circumcised. They stop at Ozinski’s bike, chained to a rack.
38) 8) dialog: I read a lot. 73.
38) 10) dialog: Yep. Bye, Robert. Ozinski nods. Oliver walks away. Then...

41) 10) dialog: Robert Ozinski and I.

41) 14) dialog: Mother. Stop feeling sorry for me. And yourself. We're doing good. You're working hard, every day and we need the money. It’s okay. 75. Holy shit. Maggie is speechless, he’s a grown-up all of a sudden.
41) 16) dialog: I've seen some billboards. “Know the signs of a stroke and call 911 immediately.” But they never say what the signs are so...
41) 18) dialog: That’s not good. Maggie puts her arm around him.
42) 0) text: Crespi’s class. Oliver’s standing in front of the darkened classroom, presenting, using the Smart Board.

42) 2) dialog: As a young man, William led a “wild and misspent youth.” Which included gambling, womanizing, drinking and other things considered inappropriate-— Brother Crespi interrupts (from the back of the room.)
42) 4) dialog: Well, he found a baby on the church steps and took it in and raised it as his own. He named him David. Click. 76.
42) 5) dialog: And then years later he went ona pilgrimage to the Holy Land with his son. And David went, like...crazy, and clubbed Saint William and cut his throat and then robbed the body. The slides are stock footage pictures of a crime scene. Blood. Mayhem.
42) 7) dialog: It’s a pretty interesting story. Which is why I chose it. The other saints I looked at were all so... “saintly” I guess.
42) 9) dialog: I don’t know. I don’t really believe in saints and all that stuff. I mean, it seems like St. William gets to be a saint just because he was killed by the boy he adopted. These days people get killed all the time. They don’t get to be saint for it.
42) 11) dialog: I don’t know any.
42) 16) dialog: He’s in the hospital.
43) 0) text: Maggie, Oliver and Daka are walking down a hallway of PATIENT rooms.

44) 2) dialog: He sounds...
44) 10) dialog: Baby?
44) 12) dialog: I don’t know. I avoid the whole situation. It’s not polite to ask a woman if she’s pregnant. So.
44) 14) dialog: Vin's like 90 something. That would be inappropriate. Daka returns with two chocolate bars. She offers one to Oliver.
46) 2) dialog: Try this one. He holds up a card. It reads: “I want fresh crab.” Vin studies the card. Then:
49) 0) text: Maggie, Oliver and their attorney, RICHARD WALTERS are on one side. On the other side: Oliver’s father, DAVID BRONSTEIN, tall, dark and disconnected, sits next to his attorney BARRY BRILLSTERN. JUDGE REYNOLDS presides, he’s examining a file full of photos.
49) 6) dialog: We went to see the horses a few times. Maggie could die. She turns back to Richard.
49) 12) dialog: The odds.
49) 14) dialog: More like social studies.
49) 16) dialog: Commerce. And biology?
52) 0) text: Oliver and Ozinski are sitting against a wall. A dodge ball game in progress in front of them.
52) 2) dialog: My mom’s the one who hates it.

52) 8) dialog: That makes more sense.
52) 10) dialog: You talk to her about it.
52) 13) dialog: Does she speak English?
52) 19) dialog: Everyday?
52) 22) dialog: He is my dad. Maggie takes this in.
52) 23) dialog: I know he cheated on you. A bunch of times. And that why we left.
52) 25) dialog: It’s a secret? You tell anybody who'll listen. Grandma, Aunt Judy, all the cousins. It’s also your Facebook status.
52) 29) dialog: Mom said I could say goodbye. Oliver just stands there. Not knowing what to say.
52) 31) dialog: Yea. I guess so.
52) 36) dialog: What’s in the box?
52) 38) dialog: She...died?
52) 40) dialog: Oh. I’m really sorry, Vin.
52) 42) dialog: They don’t know what else to say.
52) 45) dialog: That’s not true. Vin lashes out. 94.
52) 47) dialog: Yeah, I’m stupid. Mostly for thinking you were more than just a drunk, mean, old man. Oliver starts to tear.
52) 49) dialog: Don’t teach me any more gems, Vin. Save ‘em for the nobody left in your life. Toe to toe. Vin backs down.
52) 51) dialog: Your sad. Oliver walks off. Vin stares at the box. VIN'S BEDROOM — CONTINUOUS Vin’s sitting on the bed. The box, next to him. He talks to it.
53) 0) text: Computer lab. Oliver, Ozinski and OTHER STUDENTS are working on computers, wearing headsets. Oliver digs in his backpack and pulls out Vin’s Vietnam picture. The one Vin tossed in the trash. He flips the picture over, reads the handwritten inscription: “la Drang, Vietnam, 1965. Sgt. Vincent Canatella.” Oliver pecks on his keyboard: Insert - Google search bar typing: “Sgt. Vincent Canatella.” The search reveals several pages with headings: “War Hero,” “Bronze Star,” “Sgt. Canatella Rescues Two Officers,” “The Battle of la Drang.” Etc. Oliver clicks on the first link and starts reading. A picture of a younger Vin pops up. He’s a proud looking soldier. Oliver hits Ozinski. He leans over and looks.

64) 3) dialog: He peeks through the blinds every few minutes.
64) 5) dialog: Nope.
64) 8) dialog: I think he’s just misunderstood. By himself mostly.
64) 10) dialog: That's a possibility. Jesus comes over, refills Daka’s coffee.
64) 16) text: INT. OLIVER’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING Oliver’s room is full of Vin’s pictures. The memories rescued from the trash. Oliver’s getting ready for school. Standing in front of a mirror, tying a Windsor Knot on his tie. Maggie calls from the kitchen.

64) 23) dialog: I love you.
65) 0) text: The auditorium is packed to the gills with STUDENTS, TEACHERS, PARENTS and GUESTS. The curtain opens and Brother Crespi’s entire class walks out and takes seats behind the on-stage podium. Oliver and Ozinski sit next to each other. Friends for life. A projection screen displays the banner, “Saints Among Us.” The CROWD applauds. INT. VIN’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER Daka is driving like a nut. Vin’s white knuckled. He tries to light a cigarette. Daka swipes it from his mouth, tosses it out the window.
66) 2) dialog: Saints are human beings we celebrate for their dedication and commitment to other human beings. Brother Cary Crespi, circa around January... Laughs. EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES —- CONTINUOUS Daka whips the car into the school's lot. Pulls into a handicapped spot. Vin is suspect.
67) 0) text: Oliver’s in mid-presentation. On the massive projection screen behind him, we see a portrait of St. William of Rochester. Click. The screen refreshes, and a picture of Vin pops up.
67) 1) dialog: For my modern day saint, I chose a man who shares many of the same qualities as St. William of Rochester: Mr. Vincent Canatella. He continues.
68) 0) text: Outside the auditorium. Vincent stands in front of a marquee board. It’s the “Saint Wall.” Under each student's name are two pictures: a real Saint next to a Modern Day Saint. Under Oliver Bornstein, we find: St. William of Rochester and...Vincent Canatella. And he’s one fucked-up looking “saint.” Eyes black, face distorted, assuredly on drugs, lying in his hospital bed. Vin stares at the picture of himself. He hears Oliver’s voice within. Walks to the auditorium doors. 105.
68) 1) dialog: Mr. Canatella was born in Newark, NJ, in 1950, the son of first generation Italian immigrants. Vin cracks the door open. Just as he’s doing this a PRIEST comes up behind him and opens it the rest of the way.

68) 7) dialog: When my mom and I first moved here, we knew no one. (MORE)
