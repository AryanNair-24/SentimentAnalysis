Young, full of life. On the bed, a Russian woman with a tortured Brooklyn accent, DAKA, rides on top of someone we’1ll soon meet. Daka is lost in her 30s, rough, tattooed, too much makeup, and somewhere underneath it all...beautiful. Furthermore, she’s pregnant. Who knows how long, she’s so damn skinny. Grinding away.
