They’re just-- (tries an explanation) ~-all getting coffee at the same time... Helen mulls the explanation. And decides it's ridiculous. She flips a switch-- putting the jet on AUTOPILOT, grabs her suit and goes into the lavatory.

29) 64) text: We see that the boat is actually HELEN, who has contorted herself into a reasonable facsimile of an inflatable raft, and Dash-- facing backwards, his legs pounding the water furiously-- is the outboard motor. Violet sits impassively, her long hair streaming in the wind, and tries to find something interesting to look at. The Incredi-boat speeds away from us, heading toward the missile trails’ origins, and the horizon.
29) 66) dialog: What a trooper. I'm so proud of you. Panting, Dash smiles and gives her a weak wave.
29) 69) dialog: I think your father is in trouble.
29) 71) dialog: I’m going to look for him. That means you're in charge until I get back, Violet.

29) 84) dialog: As fast as you can. Stay hidden. Keep each other safe. I’1l be back by morning. Helen gives them a long hug, then turns to exit the cave. Violet, looking tortured, runs after her, stops her at the entrance. Tears well up in Violet's eyes.
29) 86) dialog: Shh. It isn’t your fault. It wasn’t fair for me to suddenly ask so much of you. But things are different now. And doubt is a luxury we can’t afford anymore, sweetie. You have more power than you realize. Don’t think. And don’t worry. If the time comes, you'll know what to do. It’s in your blood. Helen gives Violet a firm nod... and disappears into the night. Violet watches her mother get swallowed by the darkness. She looks down at the mask in her hands... ---and carefully puts it on.

46) 12) dialog: That‘s what this is? Some sort of workout? !!
46) 15) dialog: If we work together you won‘t have to be. Bok looks into her eyes, equally tender.
46) 17) dialog: Hey, we’re Superheroes. What could happen? Violet SCREAMS. She and Dash jump clear just as the van is CRUSHED by the Omnidroid’s metal foot. The INCREDIBLES run. Another Omnidroid foot SMASHES into the street, blocking the kids way. Bob and Helen stop, whirling-- HELEN (CONT’D) vi, Dash-- NO!!
