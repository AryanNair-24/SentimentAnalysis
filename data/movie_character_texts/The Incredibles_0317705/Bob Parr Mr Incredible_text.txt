Suddenly understanding, she begins to scribble... BOB (CONT’D) ~-Norma Wilcox, W-I-L-C-0-X on the third floor. But I can’t. I would advise against asking her for a WS-2475 form, which you should not fill out and file with a man named Oliver Jenkins in our legal department on the seventh floor. I wouldn’t expect someone to get back to you quickly to resolve the matter. I'd like to help. (he gives her a little smile) But there’s nothing I can do.
0) 25) dialog: (interrupting loudly) I’m sorry, Ma’am. I know you’re upset. (low whisper) Pretend you're upset. Understanding, she smiles, stands up, and EXITS weeping. Bob grins; he’s beaten the system. The old lady is gone for a total of six seconds when Bob's supervisor GILBERT HUPH enters. Huph, an anal, micromanaging little troll with a loud voice, throws a folder on Bob’s desk.

3) 0) text: A pleasant, unexceptional home in a neighborhood full of pleasant, unexceptional homes. Bob’s car pulls into the driveway, the engine sputtering a long time before finally expiring with a tired gasp. Bob steps out and SLIPS on a skateboard left in the driveway. He falls backward, grabbing the roof of the car to steady himself. He pushes the skateboard away, muttering darkly, and notices that he’s inadvertently crumpled the roof with his Super-grip.
3) 1) dialog: Ohhh, great. He decides to let it go, pushes the door closed. It won't go. He tries again, a little harder this time. No go. He SLAMS the door closed, shattering the window.
4) 3) dialog: You make weird faces, honey.
4) 5) dialog: Uh huh. Yeah. Helen SIGHS. She turns her attention to Dash, who is wrestling with an uncut slab of steak.

4) 53) dialog: Okay~- I’m intervening, I’m INTERVENING! Bob hoists the dinner table and everyone with it over his head. Dash and Vi dangle from Helen’s tangled arms and continue to scrap. Jack-Jack shrieks happily. The DOORBELL rings. Everyone FREEZES, then quickly resume their original “quiet dining” positions. Dash answers the door.

4) 102) dialog: A fire! We’re close! Yeah, baby!! Bob pulls a ski mask over his face. Shaking his head at his own complicity, Lucius does likewise.
5) 0) text: A raging inferno. Bob descends the burning steps, stops in the hallway. Both he and Frozone carry several passed- out apartment dwellers on their shoulders.
5) 2) dialog: Yeah, that’s everyone! The building is beginning to COLLAPSE. They’re trapped with no way out. Frozone tries to ice the burning walls, but his ray is weak and ineffective. BOB (CONT’D) Can‘t you put this out? Lucius I can’t lay down a layer thick enough!! It's evaporating too fast!!

5) 6) dialog: I can’t just go smashing through walls! The building’s getting weaker by the second! It’1l come down on top of us!! Lucius I wanted to go bowling!!! A large chunk of ceiling smashes to the floor in a burning heap. Bob looks around nervously, then fixes his gaze toward the door. He shifts his stack of unconscious victims to one shoulder and looks at Lucius. (CONTINUED)
5) 9) dialog: Alright. Stay right on my tail, this is going to get hot! Bob begins a shout that gets louder as he runs into the burning hallway, Lucius a half-step behind him.

5) 33) dialog: Well... I‘m back. Okay? Bob moves to go, but Helen’s left arm STRETCHES and stops him, plucking a small, dusty fragment of concrete off his coat. She crosses to him, catching up with her hand.
5) 35) dialog: (defensive) It was just a little workout, just to stay loose--
5) 37) dialog: --the building was coming down anyway--

5) 48) dialog: It's not a graduation! He’s moving from the fourth grade to the fifth grade!
5) 50) dialog: It’s psychotic! They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity, but if someone is genuinely exceptional, they shut him down because they don’t want everybody else to feel bad!
5) 52) dialog: You wanna help Dash? Let him actually compete! Let him go out for sports!

6) 3) dialog: Me too, kid. Me too. INT. BOB‘S DEN A cramped, windowless museum of MR. INCREDIBLE arcana. Walls and shelves cluttered with mementos of his storied past: framed photos, newspaper front pages, magazines, and, displayed on the wall under Plexiglas, his MR. INCREDIBLE SUIT. Bob enters and closes the door. He opens his briefcase, pulls out an INSURICARE EMPLOYEE‘S MANUAL. Bob growls and rips it in half, tossing it in the trashcan.
6) 8) dialog: (reading) HOLD STILL. Suddenly, the panel projects a red GRID over Bob’s face. We hear a robotic female VOICE--
6) 27) dialog: Hmn...? Am I? Don’t mean to be. Helen looks at Bob, puts a tender arm around him.
6) 31) dialog: Honey... about the job...
6) 33) dialog: I-I... uh... something's happened-- Helen glares at him, clearly expecting the worst.
6) 35) dialog: The company’s sending me to a conference out of town. I’1l be gone for a few days.

7) 0) text: Bob groans as he tries to disengage his generous belly from the tiny pod. Finally, with a frustrated yell, he RIPS the pod in half; FREE. He stretches, does a few toe touches and twists to shake out the kinks. He’s ready.
7) 1) dialog: Showtime. He jogs off into the jungle to track the robot.
7) 7) dialog: Hn... With a loud CRACK the trees behind him split apart and the OMNIDROID is upon him. It SLASHES at him and he dodges, but not quickly enough and the bot’s claw catches him in the shoulder, drawing blood. Fire comes into Bob's eyes and when the bot slashes again he’s ready-~ leaping over the bot and landing on his feet on the opposite side. The bot is caught by surprise and in the split second it takes for the bot to find Bob-- --BAMMMM!!! Bob has thrown a mammoth punch that sends the machine flying into the nearest tree. Bob lets out a happy snarl that says, “You just got schooled by MR. INCREDIBLE, baby.” Deep within its metal shell, servos WHINE and the bot rights itself, its EYE LENS fixing on Bob.
7) 8) dialog: Uh oh. The bot CHARGES. Once again Bob tries his patented leap-- TIME SLOWS as we cut to INSIDE THE BOT’S BRAIN. A VIEWSCREEN shows the arc of Bob’s leap being calculated by the bot.
7) 9) text: The bot swings-- SWATTING Bob mid-jump. Bob sails into a banyan tree so hard that it splits the trunk. Bob is STUNNED: the bot has quickly learned and countered. The bot CHARGES again.
7) 10) dialog: ~-as he runs for his life, the Omnidroid hot on his tail. Bob races through the jungle with surprising speed, but his added weight is slowing him down. He CUTS hard to his right and DIVES--
7) 15) dialog: Agh. My back--! The ground EXPLODES beneath him, splitting the rock. Claws rise from the lava, grip the rock, and the dreaded Omnidroid draws itself out of the lava, dripping magma, its metal body glowing red as if it came from hell itself. Bob looks down. The ground is splitting into chunks beneath his feet. In pain, barely able to move, Bob makes a desperate leap to a chunk of rock as it breaks free... and lands pathetically on top. The bot snatches him off and slams him into the ground. Then it lifts Bob up, grabbing his feet with another claw and begins to pull Bob apart. Bob strains, then-- POP! --his back realigns! Bob is a new man! With a laugh he jackknifes-- ripping off one of the Omnidroid’s claws. He drops underneath the bot, causing the bot to open a second eye in its underbelly to find him. (CONTINUED )

9) 0) text: Bob opens the door, peeks inside. The hall is massive, with an open terrace that overlooks the tropical forest. In the center of the room is an enormous dining table, placed parallel to a fall of hot LAVA. Bob checks his watch; realizes he’s early. A sudden RUMBLE makes him look up. The LAVA FALL PARTS, revealing a SECRET PASSAGEWAY. MIRAGE emerges. Bob instinctively pulls back, leaving the door opened just enough to watch. A SILHOUETTED FIGURE follows after Mirage, gesturing animatedly. They pause at the entrance to the passageway, their talk too distant to be heard. (CONTINUED)

He buys a new snazzy SPORTS CAR for himself, and a new car for Helen. After he says goodbye to Helen several mornings, clearly pretending to go off to the job he no longer holds at Insuricare, we see how he’s actually spending his days; dropping weight and getting in shape. The Superheroic workouts do their job; Bob is in the best shape he’s been in many years.

It is the remains of a MAN, his only clothes the ragged remnants of shoulder pads, boots, and an odd-looking HELMET. Bob crawls over to rub some dirt from the emblem over the eyes: the emblem reads “G B”.
27) 1) dialog: Gazerbeam... The skeleton is still sitting up, and Bob is compelled to follow its gaze to the adjacent cave wall. There... presumably in his dying moments, Gazerbeam had burned a word into the rock: “KRONOS”.
27) 2) dialog: Kronos...
27) 3) text: Just then Bob hears a sound near the blowhole of the cave. A tiny, flying PROBE rises from the hole. A scanner detects a body in the cave, and the probe flies toward it.

The other guards rush to help him, leaving their post. Bob runs up to the vehicle entrance-- it’s locked tight.

One... two... thr-- Bob is startled by a flash of light behind the fall; the passage is opening. He loses his balance, struggling to set the massive sculpture back into place before Mirage enters. Bob rushes into the closing passage. Jumps clear just as passage CLOSES. (CONTINUED )
28) 9) text: Bob enters the computer record of the development of the OMNIDROID. It squares off Superheroes on one half of the screen with progressively more advanced versions of the Omnidroid. A “TERMINATED” band blots out the loser of each encounter. Bob's eyes fill with horror: Syndrome has been using Superheroes to beta~test his Omnidroid killing machines, starting with the weaker Superheroes and working his way up as the robots became more deadly.
28) 15) dialog: As the dot over the “i” on his chest-logo LIGHTS UP... beeping. Bob looks down in surprise. An alarm sounds as the room is awash in bright light. Unwittingly Helen has exposed him.

Bob falls to the floor, swallowed up by the expanding goo.
