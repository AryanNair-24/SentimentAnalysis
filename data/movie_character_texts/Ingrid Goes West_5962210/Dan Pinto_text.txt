12) 0) text: Ingrid looks around while the owner, DAN PINTO, 34, rides two-wheeled scooter around, talking on his phone and puff on a vape pen. He wears a flat-brim hat, an XXL Jordan Bu jersey, board shorts and Adidas slides with tube socks.
12) 1) dialog: (into phone) Last night was haywire, dude. You see that girl I was talking to? Total smoke show. Bounced her back to my place for some YouTube and chill. We were up all night. Pinto glances over at Ingrid, clearly saying this for her benefit, but she isn’t paying attention at all.
12) 2) dialog: Nah, we didn’t hook up, but it’s all good. I’m juggling too many bitches right now anyway. Gotta whittle down my body count -- Ingrid clears her throat. Pinto lowers his voice.
12) 3) dialog: Hey listen, I gotta run but hit me up later if you wanna blaze. (awkward beat) Okay, yeah, no worries. Maybe some other time -- (beat) Hello...? Jeremy? Pinto hangs up and turns to Ingrid.
12) 4) dialog: Bad connection. (extends his hand) Hey. Dan Pinto.
12) 6) dialog: I don’t really like the term landlord. Just think of me as the chill guy who lives next door and collects rent every month. 19.
12) 8) dialog: It’s really more of a side hustle to keep me cash-positive while I pursue my true passion. Pinto hands her a card that reads “DAN PINTO // SCREENWRI in Batman Forever font with all of his social media handl
12) 11) dialog: You familiar with Batman?
12) 13) dialog: Not exactly. But I am working on a script for a new installment in the franchise. It ain’t exactly “authorized” but my producer Jeremy used to be Joel Schumacher’s assistant and he pretty much guaranteed he'd forward it along once I finish this new draft. Ingrid has already stopped listening and is making her wa into the bedroom. Pinto chases after her.
12) 15) dialog: All business, huh? C’mon, Ingrid. (Dr. Evil voice) Throw me a frickin’ bone here! Pinto grins, expecting a laugh. Ingrid looks uneasy.
12) 16) dialog: (clearing his throat) It’s, uh, twenty-nine hundred a month plus two month’s security deposit. No pets allowed but we are most certainly 420-friendly. Pinto offers Ingrid a hit of his vape pen. Silence.
12) 18) dialog: Very cool. I'’11 just run a quick credit check and I’1l also need some proof of income --
12) 20) dialog: Don’t take this the wrong way, but... are you a prostitute?
12) 22) dialog: Drug dealer? (no response) ‘Cause if you were, my producer Jeremy has a legit hook-up --
12) 24) dialog: My condolences.
12) 26) dialog: Welcome to La La Land, Ingrid. (pause) So, uh... what are your plans the rest of the day? Wanna grab some In & Out animal-style? My treat.
12) 28) dialog: If you need help moving, lemme know and I’1l fire up the Batmobile.
12) 30) dialog: Peace out, roomie!
13) 1) dialog: Six Flags solo mission. Shit just got real. Ingrid frowns. She opens Taylor's page instead, pulling u her vegan enchilada photo. She taps on the geotag for “Ca Gratitude” and a MAP appears showing the exact location.
18) 1) dialog: Cauliflower samosa game on fleek. Devil Horns emoji. Ingrid sighs, disappointed.
20) 1) dialog: ‘Sup, Ingrid! Ingrid tries to see past Pinto’s truck, but it’s too big.
23) 3) dialog: Hey, sorry to bug you, but... did you by any chance get a dog? Ingrid stares at Pinto blankly.
23) 5) dialog: Oh... Really? Maybe it’s the kush talking but I swear I heard barking coming from your place.
23) 7) dialog: Like Beethoven?
23) 9) dialog: What! Me too! Wanna finish it at my place? We can take my new bubbler for a test drive. 28. Before Ingrid can respond, Rothko wanders into the living room with orange dust all over his face, violently rippin apart the Cheetos bag. Pinto gives Ingrid a look.
23) 11) dialog: Yeahhhh. Unfortunately, it’s kind of a “no dog” situation up in here.
23) 13) dialog: Right. The thing is, I’m actually super allergic to pet dander. One whiff of that guy and I could go into anaphylactic shock.
23) 15) dialog: Well I guess I can let it slide this one time.
23) 17) dialog: Oh, by the way, I’m putting together a little table read for my script this weekend and I'd love to have you in the mix.
23) 19) dialog: You sure? There’s free sushi.
23) 21) dialog: Hey, all good. More sushi for me, right? Pinto grins, lingering in the doorway. Ingrid raises her eyebrows, indicating the conversation is over. He takes a step back and she closes the door, heaving a sigh of reli
27) 57) dialog: Ingrid! Hey. Sorry, you caught me in the middle of a workout sesh -- We HEAR the unmistakable sounds of porn emanating from hi laptop. Pinto exits quickly, shutting the door behind him
27) 59) dialog: Nope. All good. What’s up?
27) 61) dialog: The Batmobile? Sure thing. Where we headed? Ikea? Home Depot?
27) 63) dialog: Ooh, sorry, Ingrid. No can do. Got my big table read that night.
27) 65) dialog: Are you for real?
27) 67) dialog: Well, now that you mention it, one of my actresses booked a Nickelodeon show so we’re looking for someone to fill in as Catwoman. (grins) Whaddya say, Ingrid? You ready for your close-up? We HOLD on Ingrid as she swallows uncomfortably... EXT. PINTO’S HOUSE - DAY Pinto is leading Ingrid around his pick-up, all business.
27) 68) dialog: No texting and driving. No smoking. Premium fuel only. Oh, and there’s a little blind spot on the passenger side. You’re not gonna be towing anything, are you?
27) 70) dialog: Her engine’s been supercharged so she'll overheat if she’s pulling too much weight. Guess that’s the trade-off you gotta make if you wanna burn rubber, am I right? Pinto laughs. Ingrid laughs with a slight delay.
27) 71) dialog: Well, that concludes the tutorial. Just be back here by five on Saturday and we'll cruise to Jeremy’s dad’s house for the read.
27) 73) dialog: No worries, Ingrid. Or should I say... Catwoman?
27) 75) dialog: It’s funny. I always said I'd never let anyone else drive the Batmobile, but... I have a good feeling about you, Ingrid.
31) 6) dialog: Ingrid! Where the fuck were you?!
31) 8) dialog: Sorry, fellas. False alarm. The cops shake their heads and walk back to their car. Pi sticks his head inside the truck, sniffing the air.
31) 9) dialog: Were you smoking in here? I specifically said “No Smoking”!
31) 11) dialog: Your friend...?!
31) 13) dialog: No. You didn’t. Ingrid nervously watches Pinto make his way around the tr
31) 15) dialog: Cancelled, obviously. Pinto sees the damage and freezes, lowering his vape pen shock. Ingrid tries to remain upbeat.
31) 17) dialog: Anything else I should know about?
31) 19) dialog: Are you fucking kidding me?!
31) 21) dialog: You stole my coke too?! The cops, still idling in their car, both look up at Pint
31) 22) dialog: Thanks again, officers! Pinto angles Ingrid away, leading her back to the house. 52.
31) 23) dialog: I don’t know what to say to you right now, Ingrid. I trusted you.
31) 25) dialog: I thought you were Catwoman. Turns out you were Two-Face all along. Pinto storms back to his house, SLAMMING the door behind Ingrid stands there, feeling guilty. DING! She looks down at her phone. A new notification: “@welltaylored has tagged a photo of you.” Ingrid opens her Instagram excitedly. ON THE SCREEN - A PHOTO of her and Taylor standing under Roy’s Motel & Cafe sign, looking like best friends.
42) 3) dialog: What do you want?
42) 5) dialog: (long beat) Hey.
42) 7) dialog: Nice try, Ingrid.
42) 9) dialog: Of course I like it. That’s why I bought one off eBay two years ago.
42) 11) dialog: This is indica. Everybody knows I only smoke sativa. Besides, a replacement eight-ball would have been more appropriate.
42) 13) dialog: You did eight grand worth of damage to my car, Ingrid! Try harder!
42) 15) dialog: (curious) You mean, like a reboot?
43) 1) dialog: I read somewhere that Darren Aronofsky was attached to direct Batman: Year One. How sick would that have been? Ingrid is clearly bored but trying to seem engaged. 65.
43) 3) dialog: This place is fucking tight. Ingrid glances around, visibly unimpressed.
43) 5) dialog: I’m what you’d call a regular. (calling out) Hey, Cindy! What up, girl? A waitress (CINDY) walks by. She pauses, confused.
43) 7) dialog: Cindy, it’s me. Dan Pinto.
43) 9) dialog: Dan. She smiles politely and walks off. A long, painful silenc
43) 11) dialog: Yeah, no, totally. Pinto sucks on his straw. More silence.
43) 13) dialog: Go for it. 66.
43) 15) dialog: Gee, I don’t know. Maybe because he’s the most dynamic bad-ass in the history of entertainment?
43) 17) dialog: Actually, uh... both my parents died when I was a kid, so... I guess I related to him since we're both orphans. Ingrid stares at Pinto with newfound sympathy.
43) 19) dialog: (shrugs it off) It’s cool. At the time, I didn’t really know how to cope so... I started wearing a Batman mask to school every day and made the teachers call me Bruce. The other kids made fun of me, but I think it kind of helped me to pretend like it happened to someone else. Like, even though I was wearing a mask, I felt more like myself, you know? (beat) What about you?
43) 21) dialog: No, I mean, how did your mom die? Ingrid is caught off-guard by Pinto’s sincerity.
43) 23) dialog: Were you guys close? Ingrid pauses, as if considering this for the first time.
43) 26) dialog: No way. Are you kidding? (reassuring) I know I might seem like a cold- blooded gangster on the outside, but... I really like you, Ingrid. Ingrid stares at Pinto like no one has ever said this to before. They lock eyes for a long moment, then --
44) 1) dialog: Wait. Ingrid looks back at him, confused.
44) 3) dialog: No, nothing, it’s just... (awkward) Would you mind calling me Bruce?
44) 5) dialog: Like Bruce Way-- 68.
44) 7) dialog: Say “Gotham Needs You.”
44) 9) dialog: Say it like Catwoman.
44) 11) dialog: Oh shit I’m gonna come -- CLOSE on Ingrid’s face turned to the side as Pinto finish on her back. She stares longingly at something 0.S. HER POV - The framed Instagram photo of her and Taylor in Joshua Tree is propped up on her bedside table.
44) 13) dialog: You were really great, by the way.
44) 15) dialog: Man I'd love to, but my producer Jeremy's getting married in Martha’s Vineyard this weekend. 69.
44) 17) dialog: You know what? Fuck it. I didn’t feel like schlepping all the way out there anyway. Count me in. Ingrid smiles. She turns back, cuddling up to Pinto.
44) 19) dialog: Whaddya say? You ready for round two? I can feel the Dark Knight rising...
44) 21) dialog: (disappointed) Yeah, no, me too. I’11 just run and grab my toothbrush.
44) 23) dialog: Oh. Yeah, no worries. Ingrid picks up her phone and starts scrolling through he Instagram. Pinto slips out of bed, getting dressed.
44) 24) dialog: Excited for this weekend.
44) 26) dialog: Sweet dreams, Ingrid.
45) 2) dialog: (tugging his collar) Do I seriously have to keep this buttoned up all the way?
45) 4) dialog: (whiny) I’m not. They make their way down a footpath towards the beach.
45) 6) dialog: Seriously?
45) 8) dialog: Ingrid, I get it. You don’t have to make up some elaborate story to hide your feelings. It’s obvious you're into me.
45) 10) dialog: Relax. I’m into you too. Of course I’ll be your boyfriend.
45) 12) dialog: I’m sorry, what?
45) 14) dialog: (sighing dramatically) Anything else, your majesty?
45) 16) dialog: Who's Nicky?
45) 22) dialog: Do we know each other?
45) 24) dialog: Uh...
45) 28) dialog: Gonna be a scorcher today, huh?
46) 2) dialog: I'm sorry, okay? I didn’t want you thinking I was just some spoiled rich kid.
46) 4) dialog: That part was true actually. 73.
46) 6) dialog: Me? You’re the one dressing me up like your little twink so you can impress these hipsters -- There is a KNOCK. Taylor peeks inside, looking concerned.
46) 10) dialog: Yeah, I’d love one.
46) 13) dialog: Hell yeah! One sec! Taylor smiles and exits. Pinto turns back to Ingrid.
46) 14) dialog: Why did you tell me to stay away from Nicky? From what I can tell, he seems like a pretty chill guy.
46) 16) dialog: Oh, right, because there’s no way he could possibly like me for my personality. Is that it? Ingrid sighs, feeling bad.
46) 18) dialog: Nicky gave it to me.
48) 8) dialog: Screenwriter, actually.
48) 10) dialog: I just finished a draft of my new feature, but --
48) 13) dialog: Well, it’s kind of a re-imagining of a classic superhero story.
48) 15) dialog: How’d you know?
48) 18) dialog: Dude, that’s exactly how I feel!
48) 20) dialog: Ehh, it’s sort of a work in progress. I was supposed to do a table read a few weeks ago but one of my actresses flaked on me. Pinto shoots a pointed look at Ingrid.
48) 22) dialog: No, but I can email you guys a PDF and we can read it off our phones. Ingrid tenses up. 77. 78.
48) 29) dialog: “Catwoman removes the blade from his back and does a backflip off of the roof.” Pinto looks at Ingrid. She reads her lines aloud:
48) 31) dialog: “Batman collapses onto the ground, clutching his wound. Through the darkness, we can see blood seeping out from beneath his cape. As the camera cranes upward, we see that the pool of blood has formed into the shape... of a BAT.” (dramatic beat) Fade out. 79. A long silence. Ingrid glances around, trying to gauge everyone’s reaction.
48) 33) dialog: That bad, huh?
48) 36) dialog: Come on. Seriously?
48) 40) dialog: Bring it on, brother.
48) 42) dialog: What? That’s the whole movie.
48) 44) dialog: Correct. 80.
48) 46) dialog: No, keep going. This is great.
50) 4) dialog: Yeah, I mean... you guys did so much in Joshua Tree, I just assumed you were all huge cokeheads. Ingrid starts cleaning up all the drug paraphernalia.
50) 5) dialog: What are you doing?
53) 18) dialog: Why would I do that? Ingrid tries typing in her password but it doesn’t work.
53) 20) dialog: Straight to voicemail.
53) 22) dialog: Are you crazy? We’re almost home.
53) 24) dialog: I don’t know. Buy a new one? Ingrid gets an idea. She pulls out Rothko’s MISSING DOG flyer from her purse. Ingrid grabs Pinto’s phone and dial
53) 25) dialog: (under his breath) You're welcome... Ingrid rolls her eyes, turning away.
57) 15) dialog: Ingrid? It’s four in the morning-- His expression falls when he sees Ingrid, now sporting a prominent shiner under her left eye and crying profusely. INT. PINTO’S HOUSE - NIGHT Ingrid is on the couch, wrapped in a blanket and sipping Monster Energy Drink while Pinto paces back and forth. 95.
57) 17) dialog: Are you fucking serious right now?!
57) 19) dialog: I mean... I don’t know! We were so fucked up! I may have mentioned it at some point --
57) 21) dialog: Fuck it. I’m calling the cops. Pinto reaches for his phone but Ingrid stops him.
57) 23) dialog: This is bullshit! We can’t let him get away with this! (beat) You want me to go pound his ass?
57) 25) dialog: What’d you have in mind? I/E. PINTO’S TRUCK - NIGHT Ingrid and Pinto are parked outside of the JOLLY ROGER MO Pinto is wearing a trenchcoat and dressed in all black.
57) 26) dialog: You really think this'll work? THEIR POV - Nicky’s red Ford Mustang is parked in the lot
57) 28) dialog: What if someone sees me?
57) 30) dialog: (deep breath) Rock and roll.
58) 1) dialog: (into walkie talkie) Ingrid, do you read me? Over. INTERCUT WITH -- I/E. PINTO’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS Ingrid speaks into her walkie-talkie.
58) 3) dialog: We got an open window here. I think I can fit my arm inside so we should be good to go.
58) 5) dialog: 10-4. Commencing radio silence. CLICK. Pinto switches off his radio.
58) 11) dialog: (smiles) Mission accomplished. He tries pulling his arm back out but it won’t budge. The gap is too narrow. He tries again. Still nothing. Ingrid watches as Pinto struggles to free himself.
58) 16) dialog: Oh shit! Pinto SMASHES THE WINDOW with the crowbar, freeing his ar and takes off in the opposite direction. Ingrid watches, helpless, as Nicky sprints towards Pinto full speed, tackling him onto the pavement.
73) 6) dialog: ‘Sup, Ingrid! Ingrid seems disappointed.
73) 8) dialog: I saw your three-part suicide note on Instagram and called 9-1-1. Ingrid stares at him, bewildered.
73) 10) dialog: ‘Course. You’re my girl, Ingrid. Ingrid looks touched. Her eyes well up with tears.
73) 12) dialog: Whaddya think of my new wheels? Pinto spins around in his wheelchair.
73) 13) dialog: Turns out getting my neck broken was the best thing that ever happened to me. I had so much time on my hands that I completely retooled my script. And guess what?
73) 15) dialog: Not quite. But people are really responding to the material. I have an agent now and I just got staffed on a TV show. How sick is that? Ingrid manages a weak smile.
73) 17) dialog: Hey. Why so serious? (smiles) I know what’1ll cheer you up. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out INGRID’S PHONE. Ingrid’s face lights up. She looks at the home screen. He notification list is flooded with comments from people on Instagram. A headline at the top reads: “You have 27,683 new followers.” Ingrid stares at the number in disbelief.
73) 18) dialog: Some chick from the Huffington Post got hold of your suicide vids and re-posted the shit out of ‘em. Your face is all over the internet. You’ve even got your own hashtag. (beat) Hashtag... I Am Ingrid. Ingrid opens up her Instagram. As she scrolls through all the comments, we HEAR each one being read aloud:
