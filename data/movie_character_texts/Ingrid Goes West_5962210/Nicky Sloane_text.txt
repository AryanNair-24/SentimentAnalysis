55) 1) dialog: Thorburn! You made it. Have a seat. You prefer red or white?
55) 3) dialog: No, no. I insist. (to Waiter) What’s your most expensive bottle?
55) 5) dialog: And how much is that?
55) 7) dialog: Perfect. The Waiter scuttles off. Ingrid takes a seat across from him, watching as Nicky garnishes a plate of oysters. NICKY (CONT’D) I don’t know about you but I could really use a drink right about now.
55) 9) dialog: Phone? What phone? (quick beat) Oh, you mean this? He pulls out Ingrid’s phone from his pocket. NICKY (CONT’D) Funny. My sister has the exact same case. You guys are so similar it’s almost... creepy.
55) 11) dialog: I gotta hand it to you, that was a bold move, convincing Ezra to throw me out on my ass like that.
55) 13) dialog: Come on, Thorburn. You might have my sister fooled but not me. That’s the thing about Taylor. She only wants to see the best in people. Me? I’m the exact opposite.

55) 15) dialog: Can’t do it, Ingrid. This is just too good an opportunity to pass up. You're fucked here no matter what. So here’s the deal. I’m not gonna give you your phone back, but... I would consider renting it to you. For a nominal fee, of course.
55) 17) dialog: You pay me, let’s say... five grand once a week and I promise not to tell my sister and everyone else in L.A. what a fucking loser you are.
55) 19) dialog: What do you mean? For however long you want your friendship with my sister to continue.
55) 21) dialog: Sure you do. Disco Dan told me all about your dead mom and your backpack full of cash. Makes sense. How else could someone with no job afford to drop everything and move to L.A. Ingrid swallows, panicking.
