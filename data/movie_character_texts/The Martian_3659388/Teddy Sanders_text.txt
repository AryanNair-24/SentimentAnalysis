23) 4) dialog: At around 4:30 a.m., central standard time, our satellites detected a storm approaching the Ares 3 mission site on Mars.
23) 11) dialog: By 6:45, the storm had escalated to "severe," and we had no choice but to abort the mission. Thanks to the quick action of Commander Lewis, astronauts Beck, Johanssen, Martinez, and Vogel were all able to reach the Mars Ascent Vehicle and perform an emergency launch at 7:28 central time.
50) 3) dialog: Our nation was blessed to have Mark serving in our space program. His loss will be deeply felt, but the men and women of NASA will soldier forth, onward and upward, unbroken in the mission of their agency. In doing so, they honor the legacy Mark leaves behind, and they ensure his sacrifice will not be in vain.
54) 13) dialog: It's not gonna happen.
54) 17) dialog: No.
54) 28) dialog: You're not the only one who needs satellite time. We've got the Ares 4 supply missions coming up. We should be focusing on the Schiaparelli Crater.
54) 32) dialog: It's not about the satellite time, Vince.
54) 35) dialog: We're a public domain organization. We have to be transparent about this.
54) 39) dialog: The second we point the satellites at the Hab... I broadcast pictures of Mark Watney's dead body to the world.
54) 44) dialog: Of course I'm afraid of a PR problem. Another mission? Congress won't reimburse us for a paper clip if we put a dead astronaut on the cover of The Washington Post.
54) 48) dialog: Meteorology estimates he'll be covered in sand from normal weather activity within a year.
54) 60) dialog: Ares 5 won't even launch for another five years. We have plenty of time.
56) 7) dialog: How sure?
56) 13) dialog: Annie, one thing at a time.
56) 18) dialog: They could have been cleaned by wind.
56) 22) dialog: She could have forgotten to log the move.
56) 34) dialog: No. If Watney is really alive... we don't want the Ares 3 crew to know.
56) 38) dialog: They have another ten months on their trip home. Space travel is dangerous. We need them alert and undistracted.
56) 48) dialog: How do we handle the public?
56) 52) dialog: We'll need to release a statement with them. We don't want people working it out on their own.
56) 63) dialog: 
56) 68) dialog: 
56) 73) dialog: He's alive. But if my math is right, he's gonna starve to death long before we can help him.
70) 3) dialog: Don't say "Bring him home alive," Vincent.
70) 7) dialog: Annie...
70) 12) dialog: Seventy-six kilometers. Am I reading that right?
70) 17) dialog: I am.
70) 32) dialog: Quit being a dick, Mitch. Where's Mark going? Is this another test?
70) 36) dialog: He didn't load up the Oxygenator or the Water Reclaimer?
70) 40) dialog: You didn't see it?
70) 44) dialog: I want that gap down to four minutes. I'm giving you total authority over satellite trajectories and orbital adjustments. Make it happen.
70) 48) dialog: Let's assume Ms. Park didn't miss something, so Mark's not going to Ares 4. Yet. But he's smart enough to figure out that's his only chance. Bruce, what's the earliest we could get a presupply there?
70) 59) dialog: Three months.
70) 65) dialog: Get started. I'll find you the money.
70) 73) dialog: Sorry, Mitch. I'm with Vincent. They need to concentrate on getting home.
70) 77) dialog: Once we have a real rescue plan, we'll tell them. Otherwise it's moot. Bruce has three months to get the payload done. That's all that matters right now.
70) 81) dialog: Mark dies if you don't. 36.
102) 6) dialog: I just had to explain to the President of the United States what a "bureaucratic felcher" is.
102) 16) dialog: You're bringing this up while Vincent's in Pasadena so he can't argue the other side.
111) 13) dialog: Let's release the photo when we detail the rescue operation. I want to announce we're launching some supplies to him next year during the Hohmann Transfer window.
111) 17) dialog: Good, but Annie will handle camera appearances.
111) 20) dialog: Bruce, is your team still on schedule?
111) 31) dialog: Nine-month travel time, that puts the probe to Mars on Sol 868. Did we get the Botany Team's analysis?
111) 39) dialog: Get him in line, Vincent. We can't afford any miscommunication. I hate this margin. 912 sols worth of food. We get there on 868. And that's assuming nothing goes wrong...
117) 16) dialog: And rations get him to what? Sol 409?
117) 23) dialog: We're gonna have to launch as soon as possible. Which changes our travel time.
117) 27) dialog: 
117) 35) dialog: I'm gonna let you call Bruce and give him the news.
130) 3) dialog: Okay, let's ask the... (consults his files) Two hundred million dollar... sorry, five hundred... That's a "five?" (off their looks) Let's ask the very, very expensive question: is this probe gonna be ready on time?
130) 13) dialog: Give me a number.
130) 17) dialog: All right, let's create fifteen days. Thirteen days to mount the probe. Can we reduce?
130) 21) dialog: How often do those inspections reveal a problem?
130) 26) dialog: Right now I'm asking how often they reveal a problem.
130) 30) dialog: Anyone else know a safer way to buy more time?
130) 33) dialog: Tell Dr. Keller to stretch Watney's rations four more days. She won't like it, but that'll get us to fifteen. And we'll cancel the inspections.
130) 45) dialog: It's on me, Vincent.
148) 7) dialog: In order to make our launch window, we were forced to accelerate our schedule.
148) 11) dialog: Yes.
149) 4) dialog: Yes.
154) 24) dialog: 
154) 38) dialog: How?
154) 48) dialog: Teddy.
154) 76) dialog: Rich?
154) 80) dialog: Get out.
154) 83) dialog: Is he right?
154) 87) dialog: And we need to use the Taiyeng Shen?
154) 95) dialog: Send Watney enough food to last until Ares 4, or send Hermes back to get him right now.
154) 117) dialog: Can the Hermes function for 533 days beyond the scheduled mission end?
154) 130) dialog: We still have the chance to bring five astronauts home safe and sound. I'm not risking their lives.
154) 134) dialog: Mitch. We're going with option one.
163) 3) dialog: Annie will go before the media this morning and inform them of NASA's decision to reroute the Hermes to Mars.
163) 7) dialog: You may have killed the whole crew.
163) 12) dialog: We're fighting the same war. Every time something goes wrong, the world forgets why we fly. I'm trying to keep us airborne. This is bigger than one person.
163) 18) dialog: When this is over... I'll expect your resignation.
163) 27) dialog: (we're finished here) Bring our astronauts home.
