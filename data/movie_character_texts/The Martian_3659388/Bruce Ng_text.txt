84) 9) dialog: (off Vincent's look) Tim is our finest comm tech, and we all appreciate his acerbic wit.
84) 17) dialog: There's the Hab!
84) 36) dialog: Tim.
97) 10) dialog: Tell him. Hm. Tell him... 44.
111) 29) dialog: It'll be tight. But we'll make it.
118) 8) dialog: Okay.

154) 125) dialog: So... what? We either have a high chance of killing one person, or a low chance of killing six people. How do we make that decision?
