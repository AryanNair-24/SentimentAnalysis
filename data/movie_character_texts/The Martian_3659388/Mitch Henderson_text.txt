70) 67) dialog: It's time to tell the crew.
70) 71) dialog: You discussed this. But I'm the one who decides what's best for the crew. They deserve to know.
70) 75) dialog: Bullshit.
102) 13) dialog: I made the mistake of typing it into Google. (off Teddy's look) Don't.
102) 18) dialog: I shouldn't have to clear this with you or Vincent or anyone else.
106) 13) dialog: Hermes, this is Mitch Henderson. I have some news. There's no subtle way to put this: Mark Watney is still alive.
111) 35) dialog: Grudgingly?
117) 25) dialog: We're working on it. Prelim estimates call for a four-hundred fourteen day trip.
130) 24) dialog: Are you suggesting we don't do the inspections?
133) 3) dialog: Do you believe in God, Vincent?
133) 7) dialog: We'll take all the help we can get.
133) 10) dialog: This is the Flight Director. Begin Launch Status Check.
139) 8) dialog: Say again?
143) 7) dialog: Launch, what's happening?
143) 13) dialog: 
143) 21) dialog: SatCon?
143) 36) dialog: Roger.
143) 39) dialog: GC, Flight. Lock the doors.
154) 15) dialog: 
154) 29) dialog: Teddy doesn't even know what this is about?
154) 36) dialog: What?
154) 102) dialog: They wouldn't hesitate. Not for a second. That's why Vincent called this meeting. He wants us to decide instead.
154) 111) dialog: Bullshit. It should be Commander Lewis' call.
154) 115) dialog: She's the Mission Commander. Life and death decisions are her damn job.
154) 132) dialog: Let them make that decision.
154) 143) dialog: You goddamn coward.
163) 5) dialog: That seems like the smart move. Considering the circumstances.
163) 9) dialog: Whoever gave them the maneuver only passed along information. The crew made the decision on their own.
163) 14) dialog: No. It's not.
163) 25) dialog: (a beat; then) I understand.
176) 9) dialog: All due respect to your CNSA protocol, we haven't done things that way since Apollo
203) 15) dialog: The problem is the intercept velocity. The Hermes cannot enter Mars orbit, or they'll never have enough fuel to make it home. The MAV is only designed to get to Low Mars Orbit. So in order for Mark to escape Mars' gravity entirely and intercept the Hermes...
203) 27) dialog: There's just one passenger instead of six. With suits and gear, that saves another 500. Then we ditch the life support. We don't need it. We'll have Watney use his EVA suit for the whole trip.
203) 31) dialog: He won't. Martinez will pilot the MAV remotely from the Hermes.
203) 46) dialog: He's not even to the bad stuff yet, Vincent.
