2) 4) dialog: In grid section fourteen twenty-eight, the particles appear predominantly "coarse," but as we move to twenty-nine, the particles are much finer, and should be ideal for chem analysis.
2) 11) dialog: What's your job today, Martinez? Confirming the MAV is still upright?
2) 28) dialog: Martinez, Commander Lewis would like you please shut your smart mouth.
4) 4) dialog: Doctor Beck. And yes.
6) 2) dialog: Johanssen, constant communication is the hallmark of a --
9) 10) dialog: What's the Abort Force?
9) 31) dialog: 
9) 40) dialog: 
10) 6) dialog: Hey. Maybe we could shore up the MAV. Make tipping less likely.
10) 10) dialog: We could use cables from the solar farm as guy lines.
10) 13) dialog: The rovers could be anchors. The trick would be getting around the--
27) 23) dialog: Fuck.
28) 3) dialog: Okay. Okay...
28) 6) dialog: This is... Mark Watney. Astronaut. I am entering this log for the record, in case I... don't make it. It's...
28) 12) dialog: oh-six-fifty-three on Sol 19. And... I'm still alive.
28) 17) dialog: -- this length of our primary communications antenna tore through my bio-monitor. And ripped a hole in me as well. It was horrible thank you for asking. But the antenna... and the blood... managed to seal the breach in my suit. Which kept me alive. Even though the team must have thought I was dead.
28) 23) dialog: Yeah. 16.
33) 9) dialog: Let's do the math...
33) 19) dialog: Our surface mission here was supposed to take thirty-one days. For redundancy, they sent enough food to last for sixty- eight days. For six people. So for just me, it'll last three-hundred days. And I figure I can stretch that to four hundred if I ration. So... I've still gotta figure out how to grow three years worth of food. Here. On a planet where nothing grows. Luckily, I'm the botanist.
33) 22) dialog: Mars will come to fear my botany powers.
41) 7) dialog: The problem is water...
44) 3) dialog: Then I just need to direct the hydrogen into a small area and burn it. Luckily, in the history of humanity, nothing bad has ever happened from lighting hydrogen on fire.
44) 11) dialog: Believe it or not, the challenge has been finding something that will hold a flame. NASA hates fire. Because of the whole "fire makes everyone die in space" thing. So everything we brought with us is flame retardant. With the notable exception of... Martinez' personal items.
44) 14) dialog: Sorry, Martinez. If you didn't want me to go through your stuff, you shouldn't have left me for dead on a desolate planet.
44) 17) dialog: I figure God won't mind, considering the situation.
46) 3) dialog: So. Yes. I blew myself up.
46) 15) dialog: Interesting side note: this is how Jet Propulsion Laboratory was founded. Five guys at Cal Tech were trying to make rocket fuel and nearly burned down their dorm. Rather than expel them, Professor... Von Karman? I want to say... banished them to a nearby farm in Pasadena and told them to keep working. And now we have a space program.
57) 2) dialog: I'm gonna die up here...
58) 3) dialog: ...if I have to listen to any more goddamn disco music.
58) 13) dialog: Jesus, Commander Lewis, you couldn't have packed anything from this century?
61) 3) dialog: But here's the rub. I've got two rovers designed to go a max distance of 35 kilometers before they need to be recharged at the Hab. That's problem A. Problem B is it'll take me... roughly fifty days to make the journey. So I have to be able to live for fifty days. Inside a rover with marginal life support the size of a small van.
61) 11) dialog: And yeah, problem C is if I don't figure out how to make contact with NASA in the first place, none of this matters anyway. So... yes, in the face of overwhelming odds, I am left with only one option:
64) 3) dialog: Okay, so... success? I've doubled my battery life by scavenging Rover 1. BUT. If I use the heater, it'll eat up half my battery power every day. If I don't use the heater, I will be slowly killed by the laws of thermodynamics. (tries to stop shaking) I'd like to solve this problem, but unfortunately my brain is frozen.
65) 19) dialog: But. As long as I don't break it...
66) 3) dialog: I'm not cold anymore. And yes, I could choose to think about the fact that I'm warm because I have a decaying radioactive isotope riding shotgun next to me, but right now I have bigger problems on my hands. I've scoured every single data file on Commander Lewis' personal drive, and this is officially the LEAST disco song she owns.
72) 5) dialog: I know what I'm gonna do.
85) 5) dialog: So here's the rub...
86) 3) dialog: Somehow, we need to have complex astrophysical engineering conversations using only a still-frame camera. From 1996. Luckily, the camera spins 360, so I can make an alphabet. I just can't use our alphabet. Twenty-six letters plus question card into 360 gives us 13 degrees of arc. Too narrow. I wouldn't know what the camera was pointing at. So. Hexadecimals to the rescue...
108) 10) dialog: Now that NASA can talk to me, they won't shut up...
109) 3) dialog: They've got a room full of people trying to micromanage my crops. Which is awesome. Look, I don't mean to sound arrogant here, but I'm the best botanist on the planet. So.
109) 6) dialog: In other news, there's been a request for me to pose for a picture on the next transmission. I'm debating between "High School Senior..."
109) 9) dialog: And "Coquettish Ingenue..."
109) 12) dialog: But I'm not sure how that will translate with the spacesuit on.
131) 5) dialog: So. I have to hold out until the probe gets here with more food. And this is what "minimal calorie count" looks like. (holds up the pack) Standard issue ration. But instead of three every one day, I'm now eating one every three days.
131) 9) dialog: This is today's allotment. Which I will supplement with potatoes. Which I am beginning to hate with the fiery passion of a thousand suns. And now I've been told to do this.
131) 12) dialog: The point is, "Stretch the rations four more days" is a real dick-punch.
131) 15) dialog: I'm dipping this potato in Vicodin and there's nothing anyone can do about it.
157) 3) dialog: We evac'd eighteen sols into a thirty-one sol mission... Which means we've got thirteen sols of experiment and research schedules. For each of us. So. Commander Lewis... your work's in good hands. Beck -- I'll be honest with you, I don't understand chemolithotrophic detection. At all. But I'm doing my best. Johanssen, I know you don't like it when I touch the ChemCam, but guess what? I'm touching the ChemCam. Vogel, I think I've got a new cataloguing system for the core samples that I've titled "Das Core Samples" out of respect for the Fatherland. And Martinez... I still don't know what it is you do. Why did we bring you? No idea.
157) 11) dialog: I know that's not exactly my strong suit, but I want it all to make sense, in case... you know. Maybe you can teach it in class someday. The Watney Syllabus. "How to Make a Bathtub Using NASA Tubing and an Old RTG." "How to Cook a Potato Six-Thousand Different Ways." "How to Make Water Out of Rocket Fuel. To Keep You Alive. For Just A Little Longer."
164) 5) dialog: Every Ares mission requires three years of presupplies...
165) 3) dialog: ...so NASA figured out it's a lot easier to ship some of this stuff ahead of time rather than bring it with us. So, as a result, the MAV for Ares-4 is already waiting at the Schiaparelli Crater. And the plan is to use it to launch me into orbit just as the Hermes is passing. And then, I guess... they catch me? In space.
165) 6) dialog: Anyway, that's not really my problem right now. First, I have to get there. And it's 3,200 kilometers away. So I have 200 sols to figure out how to bring everything here that's keeping me alive -- the Atmospheric Regulator, the Oxygenator, and the Water Reclaimer -- along for the ride. Luckily, I have the brainpower of the entire planet Earth helping me with this endeavor. So far we've come up with, "Drill holes in the roof of your rover and then hit it with a rock."
189) 5) dialog: I've been thinking about laws on Mars...
190) 3) dialog: There's an international treaty saying no country can lay claim to anything that's not on Earth.
191) 3) dialog: NASA is an American non-military organization, and it owns the Hab. So, as soon as I step outside, I'm in international waters.
192) 3) dialog: Here's the cool part. I leave this morning for the Schiaparelli crater, where I will commandeer the Ares 4 lander. Nobody explicitly gave me permission to do this, and they can't until I'm aboard the Ares 4. So I will take control of a craft in international waters without permission. Which, by definition, makes me a pirate.
205) 5) dialog: 
205) 13) dialog: (thinks about it) I do like it. I do like the way it sounds.
225) 3) dialog: It's good to hear your voice, Commander. I'm eager to get up to you.
225) 6) dialog: Thank you for coming back for me.
226) 10) dialog: Tell that asshole no barrel-rolls.
229) 3) dialog: Go. 97.
233) 3) dialog: See you in a few, Commander.
242) 6) dialog: MAV to Hermes --
242) 10) dialog: Affirmative, Commander.
242) 19) dialog: My chest hurts. I think I broke some ribs.
242) 24) dialog: Yeah. The canvas didn't hold...
244) 3) dialog: Well. Shit.
246) 4) dialog: I could find something sharp in here and poke a hole in the glove of my EVA suit. I could use the escaping air as a thruster and fly my way to you. Since the source is on my arm, I could direct it pretty easy.
248) 2) dialog: I would get to fly around like Iron Man.
251) 2) dialog: Did you say "bomb?" You guys are making a bomb without me?
256) 3) dialog: Commander, I can't let you guys do this. I'm ready to puncture the suit. Let's go with the Iron Man plan.
256) 7) dialog: The thing is, I'm selfish. And I want the memorials back home to be just me. I don't want the rest of you losers in them.
256) 12) dialog: 
267) 3) dialog: You said 312? Great. I'll wave at you guys as I go by.
269) 12) dialog: Commander. Seriously.
270) 4) dialog: (having the time of his
274) 8) dialog: Contact.
275) 4) dialog: You have terrible taste in music.
280) 7) dialog: Hi guys.
280) 14) dialog: Oh. You know. Same old, same old.
280) 19) dialog: I haven't showered in a year and a half. Cut me some slack.
280) 31) dialog: I missed you guys.
283) 4) dialog: Welcome to the Astronaut Candidate Program. Pay attention. This could save your life.
283) 8) dialog: Okay, let's see if I can get some of your questions out of the way up front. Yes, I did, indeed, survive on a deserted planet by farming in my own shit. It was even more disgusting than it sounds. Let's never speak of it again.
283) 17) dialog: Question Two: "When you were stranded and alone up there... did you think you were gonna die?"
283) 21) dialog: Yes.
283) 24) dialog: And it'll happen to you, too. You should know that going in. It's space. It's filled with chance, circumstance, and bad luck. It doesn't cooperate. At some point, I promise, at some point every single thing is gonna go south on you, and you'll think: this is it. This is how I end.
283) 28) dialog: That's all it is. You simply begin. Solve one problem. Then the next one, then the next.
283) 32) dialog: All right. Questions?
