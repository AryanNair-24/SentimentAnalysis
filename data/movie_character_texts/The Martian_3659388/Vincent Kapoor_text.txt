54) 7) dialog: I thought you gave a lovely speech, by the way.
54) 10) dialog: I need you to authorize my satellite time.
54) 15) dialog: We're funded for five Ares missions. I think I can get Congress to authorize a sixth.
54) 19) dialog: They evac'd after eighteen sols. There's half a mission worth of supplies up there. I can sell another mission at a fraction of the cost. I just need to know what's left of our assets.
54) 30) dialog: I'm talking about securing us another mission. We have twelve satellites in orbit, we can surely spare a few hours --
54) 37) dialog: And?
54) 41) dialog: 
54) 46) dialog: So... what do we do? He's not going to decompose. He'll be there forever.
54) 50) dialog: We can't wait a year for this. We have work to do.
54) 63) dialog: Okay, consider this. Right now, the world is on our side. Sympathy for Watney's family is high...
54) 66) dialog: Ares 6 could bring the body back. We don't say that's the purpose of the mission, but we make it clear that would be part of it. We frame it that way, we get more support in Congress. I can sell it. But not if we wait a year.
54) 69) dialog: In a year, people won't care any more.
56) 9) dialog: Nearly 100%.
56) 16) dialog: (points to images) For starters, the solar panels have been cleaned.
56) 20) dialog: Look at Rover 2. According to the logs, Commander Lewis took it out on Sol 17. Plugged it into the Hab to recharge. It's been moved.
56) 24) dialog: Here's the clincher. Check the MDV. It's been taken apart. There's no way they do that without telling us.
56) 42) dialog: And they'd be devastated to find out they abandoned him alive.
56) 46) dialog: We have to protect the crew. There's nothing they can do anyway. Let them deal with the emotional trauma when they're not trapped in a spaceship.
56) 66) dialog: (Why? Oh...) Mark's parents.
56) 77) dialog: Can you even imagine what he's going through? He's fifty million miles from home. He thinks he's totally alone and that we all gave up on him. What kind of effect does that have on a man's psychology?
68) 11) dialog: We believe he's preparing for a journey. He's conducting incremental tests -- taking Rover 2 out for longer and longer trips each time.
68) 15) dialog: Communication. We believe he plans to travel to the Ares 4 launch site in order to make contact with us. But it would be a dangerous gamble.
68) 19) dialog: 
70) 5) dialog: You know, these interviews aren't easy. God forbid I try to say something proactive and positive.
70) 30) dialog: Ms. Park is the person who figured out Mark was alive in the first place. She's in charge of tracking him now.
70) 69) dialog: Mitch, we discussed this.
73) 6) dialog: Where the hell is he going? He hasn't changed course in thirteen days. And he's nowhere near course for Ares 4...
73) 15) dialog: What obstacle? It's Acidalia Planitia. There's nothing out there but --
73) 18) dialog: I need a map.
74) 6) dialog: I'll buy you a new one.
74) 12) dialog: I know where he's going.
74) 15) dialog: I need to get on an airplane!
76) 8) dialog: What are the odds Mark can get it working again?
76) 13) dialog: Nobody's criticizing JPL's work, Bruce. I want talk to everyone who was here in `97.
78) 3) dialog: This the replica?
78) 11) dialog: Pathfinder.
84) 5) dialog: Have you received it yet?
84) 15) dialog: Martian surface... more surface...
84) 19) dialog: What's that?
84) 29) dialog: "I'll write messages here. Are you receiving?"
84) 32) dialog: "Point here for yes." "Point here for no."
94) 3) dialog: We've been watching you since Sol 54...
99) 7) dialog: Mark, please watch your language...
111) 7) dialog: Just be grateful you got something, Annie.
111) 11) dialog: I could tell him to take his helmet off, but then he'd, you know, die.
111) 15) dialog: I'm on a plane to you this afternoon. We'll have the release ready.
111) 33) dialog: They estimate Mark's crops will last him until Sol 912. They grudgingly admit Mark is doing great work.
111) 37) dialog: Mark has a tendency to tell them to have sex with themselves whenever they question one of his decisions.
116) 3) dialog: The crops are dead...
117) 3) dialog: Complete loss of pressure boiled off most of the water.
117) 10) dialog: Any bacteria that survived, died in the sub-zero temperatures when exposed to Mars' atmosphere.
117) 14) dialog: He can still eat the potatoes he has, he just can't grow any more. We estimate they'll give him about 200 sols.
117) 18) dialog: 
117) 33) dialog: Six months. Minimum.
127) 3) dialog: "...the probe will take 414 days to reach you, and will deliver enough food to last you to Ares 4."
127) 7) dialog: "We've officially named the probe `Iris'..."
130) 19) dialog: It... actually only takes three days to mount it. We can get that down to two. But the other ten are for testing and inspections.
130) 28) dialog: About one in twenty launches. But that's grounds for a countdown halt. We can't take that chance.
130) 35) dialog: Teddy...
133) 5) dialog: Several. My mother's Catholic and my father's Hindu.
148) 3) dialog: ...we substituted protein cubes for the standard rations. The thrust of the launch, combined with the simultaneous lateral vibration, liquefied the cubes and created an unbalanced load.
153) 3) dialog: We're jettisoning any sort of landing system -- the idea is we're only sending rations, so they can crash land on Mars...
153) 11) dialog: I'm sorry -- who are you?
153) 15) dialog: 
154) 5) dialog: I had to make something up.
154) 31) dialog: Tell them exactly what you told me.
154) 57) dialog: The Taiyeng Shen.
154) 64) dialog: Watney would have to intercept using the MAV.
154) 85) dialog: I believe so.
154) 89) dialog: Yes.
154) 93) dialog: Because we can only do one.
154) 97) dialog: 
154) 113) dialog: It's a matter of life and death, Mitch. We need to make this decision.
154) 119) dialog: It should. The Hermes was made to do all five Ares missions, so it's only halfway through lifespan.
154) 123) dialog: We would lose the crew. And the Ares Program with them.
154) 127) dialog: We don't. Teddy does.
156) 8) dialog: And nobody gave him instructions? Did JPL schedule something?
156) 24) dialog: Commander Lewis' geo-compositing experiments.
156) 28) dialog: He's finishing the mission.
200) 4) dialog: How's our boy doing?
200) 15) dialog: How's his morale?
200) 19) dialog: (thinks about that... huh) Mars would be governed by maritime law, so technically --
203) 17) dialog: He needs to be going fast.
203) 22) dialog: You can do that?
203) 29) dialog: How will he use the controls?
203) 33) dialog: We've never had a manned ship controlled remotely before. (off Mitch's look) But... I'm excited for the opportunities that affords.
203) 44) dialog: You're going to have a remote controlled ascent with no backup comms?
203) 49) dialog: You better skip to the bad stuff.
203) 53) dialog: (what?) You're taking the front of the ship off?
203) 57) dialog: You're going to launch a man into space with a giant hole in the front of the ship?
203) 64) dialog: You're sending him to space under a tarp.
203) 73) dialog: 
204) 5) dialog: Do you think he meant it like...
221) 5) dialog: Not a damned thing. (off her look) It's all happening twelve light-minutes away. That means it takes twenty-four minutes for them to get the answer to any question they ask. The whole launch is twelve minutes long. They're on their own.
221) 10) dialog: (cutting her off) Yes.
221) 17) dialog: 
285) 6) dialog: Good morning. Their mission is scheduled for 41 Sols. Your briefs detail the research and experiment schedules...
