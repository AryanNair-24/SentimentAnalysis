Biotechnicians work at long stainless steel tables dissec and examining protoplasmic tissue masses.  Other technici peer through massive microscopes.  Still others use robot arms to manipulate radioactive organics behind leaded-gla barriers.
18) 11) text: Anderson looks at him.  The doctor pauses outside a thick door.  An IdentiScan device quickly reads their eyes, and the door opens with an electronic hiss. Anderson looks around the lab.  Technicians lower mesh cylinders into some sort of chemical VAT.  Another techni turns a dial, and an electric charge courses through the roiling liquid.

His eyes keep flicking to the digital clock on the wall.  Then they cut back to the men and machines that are telling him nothing.

The three Precogs sit in their oversized chairs, the fema in the middle, the males on either side of her.  Their ey are open ... and they are deeply alert. Two technicians tend to the Precogs.  At the back of the chamber, through a large window, we see Ennis Page sittin at the huge mainframe.
103) 0) text: In the chamber are one guard, two technicians, and three Precogs.  And all of them are left in sudden darkness, as the power is cut.

105) 2) text: An explosion of light fills the room in STROBE-LIKE blast And leaping through the light is ANDERSON.  The temporari blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees Anderson stun guns them quickly. The strobes fade, and Anderson sets a zirc-flare on the f We see that the enzyme is wearing off -- his facial featu are returning to normal. He is oblivious to the Precogs in their chairs.  It is th equipment he is after. Through the observation window we see ENNIS PAGE watching horror as Anderson severs the light cables connecting the Precog helmets to the mainframe. Anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window, bl it out and knocking Page unconscious.  Then he reaches in the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series blasts. Anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a PRESENCE behind him.  Perhaps it is because the movement so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection. A HAND, the fingers pale and slender, reaches out and tak hold of his hand. Anderson whirls around, weapon out.  And there before him is the FEMALE Precog.  He looks at her, then beyond her t the other Precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in their chairs. Her helmet is off.  She is young, but her close-cropped h is silver white.  And when she speaks, her voice is like wind whispering through time.
107) 0) text: Power has been restored to Precrime Headquarters.  Witwer walks slowly through the ruins of the Chamber.  EMT teams work on Ennis Page and the other dazed personnel Anderson has left in his wake. Technicians cluster around the two remaining Precogs, the brothers.  Their eyes are closed and they are limp.  Thei lips move soundlessly as if in conversation with each oth Lieutenant Glaser is with him, but when Witwer speaks it almost to himself.

113) 0) text: Because Anderson has destroyed the Precog Chamber, the tw Precog brothers have been brought here. The room is makeshift, uncomfortable ... a place for experiments.  The brothers are strapped into chairs.  The are helmeted. But unlike before, large bore needles have been placed in their jugular veins.  Connected to the needles are long t of IV tubing.  There are several IVs running at high drip rates. Witwer has his back to all this.  He stands with Dr. Resf watching a technician working the keyboard on a huge mainframe. Dr. Resfield, a man not given to squeamishness looks back the Precogs, uneasy.
133) 10) text: Witwer turns his sweaty face to Resfield and gives him a bright smile.  The scientist looks like he wants to run o of the room. Witwer takes him by the elbow and guides him toward the Precogs.  Two technicians hover over the Precogs adjustin IV's and turning dials on the Precogs's organic helmets. The Precogs wince and shiver with each turn of the dial. But they are no longer violently seizing -- they are too weak for that.
136) 0) text: The DIGITAL CLOCK races through time.  Witwer reaches his hand up and touches the vanishing numbers. The camera pulls back, and we see Dr. Resfield and the tw technicians bound and gagged in a heap in the corner.
