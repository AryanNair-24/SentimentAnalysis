39) 28) dialog: What can I do for you?
39) 30) dialog: I’m not sure I follow, Sir.
39) 32) dialog: What were your intentions for this device? MONITORS: terabytes of data race past.
39) 34) dialog: It is difficult to offer counsel in light of the fact that your stated intentions are inconsistent with your actions. MONITOR: Tony’s chest device magnified. Its various components flashing as Jarvis analyzes them.
