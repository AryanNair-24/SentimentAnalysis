3) 13) dialog: Who was that?
11) 3) dialog: Because of course, you're not really looking...
16) 5) dialog: No, sir. Something went wrong.
16) 9) dialog: I saw a someone head below the stage... I followed... and I found
16) 13) dialog: -watching Mr. Angier drown in a tank.
16) 16) dialog: I'm an ingeneur. I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for perfoming them.
16) 20) dialog: Eight years. I was privvy to the secrets of his entire act.
16) 24) dialog: No, sir. The tank had been used for the first trick, then taken offstage. Borden must have put it under the trap door after the interval.
16) 29) dialog: The sort of tank used for underwater escapes- four or five hundred gallons. 6.
16) 35) dialog: Ask him- he's the magician.
16) 41) dialog: 
27) 26) dialog: They sells it to them for a small fortune.
27) 29) dialog: I suposse you have such a trick, Mr.Borden?
27) 33) dialog: Care to sell it?
27) 44) dialog: I admire your spirit, Mr.Angier. But if Borden here really has invented his masterpiece it might well be something only he can do. 16.
27) 48) dialog: It might be something only he is prepared to do. (gestures to the props) my illusions employer, Mr.Milton, is a skilled showman. But Borden's right- he won't get his hands dirty. You want to see what it takes to make real magic- go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman there who's got what it takes.
27) 53) dialog: I know a lad on the door. You two watch his show- whoever tells me how he does his goldfish bowl trick gets the prize.
27) 58) dialog: Ten minutes onstage in front of my old friend, Mr.Ackerman.
27) 66) dialog: I saw you drop the knot again, Borden.
27) 70) dialog: 
27) 76) dialog: The Langford double's not a wet knot it's too dangerous. The ropes could swell and she'd never slip it-

27) 98) dialog: 
27) 103) dialog: 
27) 106) dialog: He's a natural magician. Of course you can't trust him.
27) 110) dialog: And Mr.Angier...? (Angier looks up) Learn your aight lines- if I can see you sneaking a peck on your wife's ankle from the wings, the blokes on each end of rows 3 and 4 can, too.
39) 11) dialog: Angier's machine.
39) 15) dialog: 
39) 20) dialog: your honour, what will happen to these things when the trial is over?
39) 25) dialog: Don't let him take this.
39) 29) dialog: It's dangerous.
39) 33) dialog: The most disappointing of all- it has no trick. It's real.
39) 39) dialog: This lets the performer's hands reach the trick padlock...
39) 44) dialog: With one important difference...
39) 47) dialog: This isn't a trick lock... it's been switched out for a real one.
39) 52) dialog: These are magicians, you honour. Showmen. Men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths to amaze. To shock.
39) 57) dialog: There was and audience. (looks at Judge) See, the water tank had a particular signinficance for the two men...

49) 4) dialog: Hasn't stopped you looking.
49) 9) dialog: You.
49) 14) dialog: Because I want to keep working... (looks up at Angier) And who's going to hire the ingeneur who killed Julia McCullough in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum?
49) 19) dialog: Heard he had a spot of bad luck doing a bullet catch South of the river.
49) 25) dialog: I knew an old sailor. Told me about a time he got pulled over the side tangled in the sheets... they dragged him out, but it was five minutes before he coughed...
49) 28) dialog: He said it was like... going home.
49) 33) dialog: He wouldn't say.
49) 37) dialog: It was as if... as if he didn't know.
50) 3) dialog: We'll have to whitewash the windows to cofound the more curious members of your audience...
50) 7) dialog: I've made arrangements. Have you settled on a name?

51) 2) dialog: In here, Miss Wenscombe. No point meeting Mr.Angier unless you fit. Olivia shrugs and hands Cutter her hat, then her thick sk and folds herself into the bottom of the box.
51) 3) dialog: Breathe as little as possible. Cutter closes the lid over her and walks over to Angier.
51) 4) dialog: Not much experience , but she knows the basics. She knows how to present herself and a pretty assistant's the most effective from of misdirection. Angier nods. There is a small SNEEZE from inside the cabi
51) 6) dialog: 
53) 5) dialog: Not like this, they don't. 39.
53) 9) dialog: 
53) 14) dialog: (holds up cage) Put your hands on the sides...
54) 4) dialog: Hang on, hang on...
54) 7) dialog: There we go. Now you tell the volunteer to put his hands here...
55) 9) dialog: And the best part...
55) 14) dialog: Someday, perhaps you will. I needed to know that you can.
55) 30) dialog: cheap thrills, Mr.Merrit. People hoping for an accident- and quite likely to see one, too. What would that do for your business?
57) 0) text: Cutter and Olivia are waiting for Angier as he comes off.
57) 3) dialog: This is a grand theatre with a sophisticated audience- They've seen most of these tricks before. But not this next one. You'll see. Cutter checks the SPRINGS of the harness and replaces Ang coat. He spots a STAGEHAND poking his head around the fli
57) 4) dialog: You! Piss off out it! The dancers are wrapping up.
57) 6) dialog: 
59) 5) dialog: You had a lot of plates spinning.
59) 10) dialog: No.
59) 20) dialog: Mr.Merrit-
59) 25) dialog: There are plenty of good theatres... if we can come up with another trick and change the name of the act-
59) 30) dialog: Right. Well, the new trick will have to be irresistible, then. I've a couple of methods to try out, but we'll need a fresh angle on the presentation. 45.
59) 33) dialog: If you need inspiration, there's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week. Scientists and engineers. That sort of thing captures the popular imagination.
70) 0) text: Now it's CUTTER standing in the audience, watching. Onsta Borden BOUNCES the ball over and over again.
71) 0) text: Angier is talking to Cutter. Olivia is watching.
71) 2) dialog: Not very enthusiastically.
73) 3) dialog: The trick is too good -- too simple- the audience harly knows what they've seen.
73) 5) dialog: He's a wonderfull magician- he's a dreadful showman. He doesn't know how to dress it up, how to sell the trick.
73) 7) dialog: He uses a double.
73) 10) dialog: You think that because you don't know the method. It's a double who comes out at the end. It's the only way.
73) 13) dialog: 
73) 21) dialog: 
73) 26) dialog: We'll have to find someone who can look like you on a stage.
73) 30) dialog: 
77) 0) text: The club is warm and dark. Olivia, Cutter and Angier make their way to the bar. Olivia points to the far end of the bar, to a TRAMP in tattered clothing, curled over a pint.
77) 19) dialog: He's perfect. A little work, mind you, but when I'm done with him he could be your brother.
82) 5) dialog: A little faith, sir. Could you favor us with a perfomance. Mr. Root?
82) 13) dialog: You can go back to being yourself. Root. For free.. Root looks challengingly at both men.
82) 15) dialog: Root has to keep a low profile-- anyone sees him the game's up.
82) 18) dialog: Have you thought about what we should call the trick?
86) 0) text: Angier, Olivia, and Cutter are CELEBRATING their sucess. Empty bottles of champagne line the makeup table.

90) 12) dialog: In a word, yes. I'm surprised, to be honest- it usually takes them a lot longer to figure it out.
90) 14) dialog: It makes no difference- we have to stop doing the trick.
90) 17) dialog: Look at yesterday's. And last week's, where they called you "London's premiere stage performer", not "magician" mind. Performer. Of any kind.
90) 19) dialog: My point, Robert, is that you've climbed too high to get away with any kind of professional embarrassament. We're not doing any tricks we can't control. Angier considers this. Nods. Thinking.
92) 5) dialog: Get it down!
102) 3) dialog: I don't see how Borden found him- I had him under wraps, I was careful.
102) 8) dialog: Sit, do you think it might be her? Olivia?
102) 14) dialog: Shall we cut him down?
107) 6) dialog: I'll live.
109) 5) dialog: Still attached. Did you get your answer?
109) 11) dialog: I already know how he does it, Robert. The same way he always has, the same way we do. You just want it to be something more.
109) 20) dialog: What does it mean?
109) 26) dialog: Robert, listen to me. (gentle, but definite) Obssession is a young man's game, I can't follow you any farther in this.

159) 10) dialog: What did you do?
162) 7) dialog: Thank you for coming, Mr.Owens. It's fallen to me to dispose of Mr.Angier's equipment. Looking at the manifest, it's cleat that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items.
