62) 5) dialog: With a system like this I could have the entire city electrified whitin two years.
62) 8) dialog: Mr. Edison's direct current system is flawed and dangerous. With my alternating current devices-
75) 8) dialog: So this is the Great Danton.
75) 11) dialog: Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions. Something you did with pockets?
75) 19) dialog: Our bodies, Mr. Angier, are quite capable of conducting, and indeed, producing energy.
75) 22) dialog: Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?
76) 3) dialog: Alley has explained that you require a very interesting device.
76) 7) dialog: You're familiar with a phrase 'Man's reach exceeds his grasp'?
76) 11) dialog: (off his look) It's a lie. Man's grasp exceeds his nerve. The only limits on scientific progress are these imposed by society. Tesla looks out at the mountains.
76) 12) dialog: The first time I changed the world I was hailed as a visionary. The second time I was asked politely to retire. The world only tolerates one change at a time. And so here I am. (gestures at laboratory) Enjoying "retirement". (looking at Angier) Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier. What you want is simply expensive. Tesla rises, washing his hands in a basin on a side table
76) 13) dialog: Alley says you are a stage magician. If a built you this device, you would be presenting it only as an illusion?
76) 15) dialog: Mr.Angier, the cost of such a machine-
76) 17) dialog: Perhaps not. But have you considered the cost?
76) 19) dialog: I can make your machine, Mr. Angier. But I can also give you some advice...
76) 24) dialog: At first. But I've followed them too long- I am their slave. Their whipping boy. And one day they may choose to destroy me. Angier looks into Tesla's eyes.
76) 26) dialog: 
76) 29) dialog: I have already begun to build it, Mr. Angier. I hope you enjoy the mountain air. This will take time. Tesla disappears into the lab.
87) 3) dialog: You must be curious to see what so much money had bought you, Mr. Angier.
87) 6) dialog: Fitting that you should be here for the maiden voyage.
87) 9) dialog: Your hat.
87) 14) dialog: No, no. It will be fine. Mr. Alley, please proceed.
118) 4) dialog: 
118) 6) dialog: 
119) 21) dialog: That would be unwise, Mr.Angier.
119) 23) dialog: It is true, sir, that you are your one remaining financier. But we have not stolen your money...
119) 33) dialog: Because exact science, Mr.Angier, is not an exact science. The machine simply does not operate as expected. It needs continued examination.
119) 41) dialog: Which is why we need to rey a different material. It may provoke a different result. Tesla opens the cage and points the open end at Alley.
119) 42) dialog: You don't expect me to handle the thing myself? Alley reluctantly reaches into the cage and pulls out the TERRIFIED CAT. He jumps down into the pit and secures the animal bu its collar to a eye-hook sunk into the ground.
122) 7) dialog: These things never quite work as you expect them to, Mr. Angier. That's one of the principal beauties of science.
122) 10) dialog: We'll need a couple of weeks to iron
122) 14) dialog: Don't forget your hat. Angier stops and looks at the pile of hats.
122) 16) dialog: They are all your hat, Mr. Angier. Tesla smiles at him.
135) 6) dialog: Such thing will only bring you misery.
151) 0) text: Fallon is at the workbench, staring at a sketch of Tesla' machine. Borden paces, AGITATED.
190) 0) text: Angier stands in front of Tesla's machine. Loading the pistol. He places the pistol by the machine... Angier takes off his jacket and steps towards the HISSING machine. BOTLS curl themselves around him.
