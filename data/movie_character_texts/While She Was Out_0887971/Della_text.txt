A branch has broken from a tre and drags down into the stream behind her. This seems to bring her back to herself. She realizes it' only a matter of time before they come looking for her. S needs to get moving. She sets off downstream. She trudges through the shallow water. Her wet coat drags heavily. The stream must end somewhere, likely at the other edge o the woods. She trudges onwards, sweeping aside the branches of stoop trees, stepping around rocky obstacles in the stream. Forging ahead. She now needs to pee. GREAT. Her temper surges up. She looks for the right place to do it, realizes it's probably best to pee in the stream, so all trace of it wi be dispersed. A leafless willow trails its dried up branches into the stream. She makes her way toward it. She lays the toolbox down and disappears between the branches.

She drives the screw driver deeper in until she feels her knuckles dig into his stiff hair. Vinh's scream becomes a high keening wail. The screwdriver pierces the base of Vinh's skull. It protrudes through his mouth, knocking several teeth out i stream of blood. His scream cracks into a death rattle as hers begins. They roll downstream. His arms are wrapped in a death grip around her. They roll until they crash full into a tree about two thi of the way down. She feels his grip loosen and his body slump over hers. H becomes so heavy he almost crushes her underneath as he d right there on top of her. She's trapped, suffocating underneath him, until she find the strength to push him off. She crawls out from under his body. Pushing him away, sets him off rolling again. She tries to stand up but her legs are unsteady. Her head hurts so bad it's about to burst. The world around her shifts into a migraine zone. Trails follow trees, rocks, brush. The desire to close her eyes, close it all out almost overwhelms her.
