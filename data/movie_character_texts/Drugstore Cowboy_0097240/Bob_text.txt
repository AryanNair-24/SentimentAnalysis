10) 32) dialog: Nadine starts to lower the whole drawer into the bed of the truck, then lets it rest on the truck's side panel while she opens the door of the truck. Nadine then grabs the drawer, swings it backward as far a her arms can go and brings the drawer forward as if she i a fish wife emptying a pan of water, spilling the bottles all over the seat and floor of the truck. Bob can't believe what he's seeing.
10) 37) text: Nadine bends down with the empty drawer between her legs then straightens up, flipping the drawer up and over her head. It sails into the air... SPINS AROUND a few times and lands in the street a few parking meters away. A small grey VOLKSWAGEN rounds a corner and slows down near the drawer, seemingly studying it momentarily, then it drives on. ANOTHER CAR is coming as Bob and Rick reach shaking Nadine. They quickly push her into the pickup and Bob pulls away, sitting on a pile of bottles, for once saying absolutely nothing. 122 123 124
11) 3) text: Bob takes a deep breath.
11) 4) dialog: Okay. Let's get all these bottles together, put them in a sack and you, Nadine, you take that sack and walk over to those bushes along side that house and wait for us while we go back and get that drawer and clean it up. You didn't have any gloves on and, baby, that clean cream drawer is going to have nothing but your fingerprints all over it. It takes a second to get all the bottles together. INT.

11) 13) dialog: You know what this bottle is worth, Rick? He holds up the bottle that is only two inches high. Rick shakes his head as he takes the bottle from Bob.
11) 14) dialog: Well, I'll tell you what it's worth. It's worth a goddamn fortune, at least a small fortune. That there's got eight hundred and forty some odd sixteenths in it, and at ten dollars a sixteenth, that comes to around eight thousand four hundred dollars worth of the best goddamn dope money can buy. Slaps his leg.
11) 18) dialog: Okay, pards, I'l] show you how we'll hide this stuff in these motels. Open up that trap door to the attic, and I'll push you on up through. You cross over a couple of these units and stash the stuff over somebody else's room.
11) 36) text: Rick breaks into a car in the hospital parking lot. Bob and Dianne kiss before he takes off. Dianne watches from her stolen car as Rick, in his car heads right between two parked police cars ata hair-raising thirty-five miles an hour. Only three feet separates the two cars, so Rick gets both of their rear fenders in the initial rush.
11) 40) text: Then he throws the car in reverse, and floorboards the accelerator. His car clings to the smashed police cars for a second while his tires scream and pour out smoke. then abruptly, the torn and intermeshed metal of the cars separates and away Rick roars again until he comes to a halt forty feet away against another late model car. VIEW of the Hospital, people are hanging out the windows watching. 133 134 135 9-10-88 60 Rick keeps right on working, he gives the police another shot for good measure, then he picks out an automobile behind and off to one side and gives it a bank shot that crumples the right front fender. TWO POLICEMEN come running from the front doors of the hospital. They run across the front lawn less than a hundred yards away from Rick. Then Dianne gets into the act. She holds her horn down causing one continuous blast, and squeals out of her position toward the officers, who are running after Rick. VIEW of Dianne closing in on the officers, who take a div to the ground. Dianne keeps going until she comes to Rick, who has ditched his car and is now on foot. She stops momentarily to let Rick in, then turns and takes off burning rubber all the way out of the parking lot. BOB SEES and HEARS the pandemonium from where he is hidin up against the side of the building.
11) 41) dialog: They'll probably talk about this one for years. He smiles and quickly smashes out a window and climbs int a vacant office.
11) 45) dialog: Fuck it! The sweat is pouring down Bob's face in rivulets, his clothes are damp and his hands are beginning to shake. He tries forcing the bar into the crack beside the cabine door, but the bar jumps toward him every time he applies pressure. He tries lifting the cabinet free from the wall, but it i solid. He jams the pry bar between the wall and the cabinet and gives a mighty heave. The cabinet bends toward him, but it's obvious that this will take too long Bob stands back from the cabinets and brings the wedge shaped point of the bar down in a cutting motion in an attempt to tear a hole in the sheet metal and more or les can-open the thing enough to reach inside.
11) 48) dialog: ugh! He raises his pry-bar to go for another cabinet when the door of the pharmacy breaks open behind the weight of .TW BURLY ATTENDANTS. They hurl themselves into the room, take one look at Bob and immediately begin closing in. 138 139 140 141 142 143 9-10-88 62 Bob swings his bar at them, and leaps over to a window overlooking one of the quaint little gardens in the hospital courtyard. With one swing of the bar, he smashes out the window and dives through it.
11) 73) dialog: Honey! I'm home!
11) 75) dialog: What in the hell is going on? Dianne turns and looks at Bob's bedraggled appearance.
11) 77) dialog: Who put that hat on that goddamned bed?
11) 79) dialog: (seeing Nadine) What?
11) 81) dialog: She bit it.
11) 83) dialog: Who gave her the stuff, she couldn't have done that on no two-sixteenths. What's she been doing, saving it up? Bob picks up a bottle beside the bed, the small blue partially filled one. Bob shakes Rick takes
11) 84) dialog: Where in the hell did she get this?
11) 86) dialog: I knew there should have been another opened bottle. She must've picked it up while we were collecting the bottles off the floor of the truck. Stupid conniving bitch.
11) 88) dialog: She beat you, man. Your own woman beat you out of part of your own cut on a score. She got what she deserves. a swing at Bob but misses and sends his hand through a plaster wall. 152 153 Cr 154 9-10-88 66
11) 89) dialog: Not only that, the dumb bitch threw a hex on us that we'll all be lucky to survive. And she left us with and 0.D.'d stiff which, if I'm not mistaken, is paramount to a murder beef in this state. And for Christsakes get that hat off the bed. Bob kicks the hat off the bed and backs out of the room away from Rick who is pulling his hand out of the wall. Dianne is clinging to Bob's arm. Bob slams the door.
11) 92) dialog: I hid in a woman's restroom. When I woke up and left, I ran into a nurse and gave her a story that I was looking for the emergency room. They fixed me up pretty good.
11) 95) dialog: You know what, Dianne? That's probably the best idea you've come up with in years.
11) 97) dialog: We got to get Rick here in bed. He's been up all night and probably don't know what the hell he's doing, do you, Rick? 155 156 157
11) 105) dialog: Hell, it's like trying to raise a couple of goddamn kids when you take on a couple like that and try and teach them to steal. Do you know that, Dianne? It's just like raising children. All the hassles, all the petty Jealousies, all the what-ifs.
11) 107) dialog: I'm getting too old for this shit. These goddamn kids today, they ain't got no sense at all. They're all TV babies. They been watching people killing and fucking each other on that goddamn boob tube and that's all they know. Hell, they think it's legal, that it's the right thing to do.
11) 109) dialog: Wow, what a busy day. 9-10-88 68 Bob checks the peephole.
11) 110) dialog: I think it's the guy from the front desk. Bob slowly opens the door. A uniformed MOTEL MANAGER is outside. Bob closes
11) 112) dialog: Yes.
11) 114) dialog: No, why?
11) 116) dialog: You mean I got to move out right now?
11) 118) dialog: Well you just listen here. One of our colleagues is very sick and I just don't feel that we want to up and try to move to another motel...
11) 120) dialog: Let me come down to the office in a minute. I'll be right down. the door.
11) 121) dialog: They're having a sheriff's convention.
11) 124) dialog: Jesus Christ, a sheriff's convention, no less. Why couldn't it be a pharmacist's convention?
11) 129) dialog: I got a colleague in that motel room that's got the mumps, I'm scared to move him. What if they should spread. Hell, we'd hit you with a law suit that would ruin you. Now can't you juggle those rooms around a bit or get the intendeds a reservation somewhere else?
11) 134) dialog: It looks like a fucking sheriffs convention out there. but they're going to let us keep the room one more night.
11) 136) dialog: I don't know.
11) 138) dialog: (astounded) Are you mad, Dianne? She'd be oozing down out of the attic in less than a week. These people around here have seen her. They're going to remember that she was with us. No we got to get her out tonight. INT. MOTEL DAY (later)
11) 139) text: Bob and Dianne sitting across from each other. Bob is showing signs of wear.
11) 143) dialog: Yeah, I suppose you could say that. I'm not exactly thrilled over her having left us in such an abrupt manner.
11) 145) dialog: Like what?
11) 147) dialog: Oh, yeah, well 1'11 tell you what's wrong. I'm scared to fucking death that some big fucking cop is going to come rumbling through that door any minute and say, "Out this is my fucking room, out." (long pause) Do we have that garment bag in the car?
11) 151) dialog: God what a hassle. Bob wipes his brow.
11) 154) dialog: (to Dianne) You go first, unlock the car. Look around a bit while you're doing it. See if anyone is lurking about. Dianne puts her coat on, smiles, turns to the door and heads for the parking lot. Bob stands and fidgets in front of the curtains, not watching Dianne in the parking lot. He can hear the trunk of the car open. Then a few seconds later Dianne returns.
11) 157) text: Bob crosses the parking lot with Nadine over his shoulder, making it seem like she doesn't weigh a thing. He puts Nadine in the trunk and returns to the room. In front of their room is a suspicious cop. Bob ad libs.
11) 158) dialog: Did you remember the diapers, hon?
11) 160) text: Bob enters, a little winded.
11) 161) dialog: Wow, what a drag. I mean, that broad was heavy. You're right, she would have been fat in a couple of years. Jesus, I'm glad she decided to go and do her thing now instead of waiting until then. I'd of never made it. Bob looks at Dianne and tried to grin but it didn't come out quite right. He looked like a little kid about to bawl. 9-10-88 73
11) 162) dialog: How about going up in the attic and getting out our stuff and dividing it up. We'll give Rick the car and the stuff we sent ahead to those bus depots. Figure it all out. Don't count him short. Give him the big end. Dianne stared at Bob until he turned away.
11) 164) dialog: The thing is I've been thinking about heading on back to the coast. I think maybe I'll go on down and get on that twenty-one day methadone withdrawal program, get my head together.
11) 166) dialog: No I'm not, Dianne. I can't do it anymore. shakes his head no.
11) 168) dialog: Why can't you come along?
11) 170) dialog: Why not?
11) 172) dialog: Do whatever you want, Dianne. Bob looks around. 172 173 174 175 176 9-10-88 74
11) 173) dialog: Take whatever you need or whatever we got. I only need enough to get me to the coast. Dianne is acting like she doesn't know whether to believe her man or not, knowing that this is the end of their relationship if Bob goes.
11) 177) dialog: Get the shovel, Dianne. I'11l handle her.
11) 179) dialog: You, Rick, stay here and see that nobody comes along and wants to know if we're having a picnic or something.
11) 182) dialog: I'm sorry Nadine, if I'd have known this was going to happen then I would never had let you come along. 177 178 179 180 9-10-66 75
11) 184) dialog: Well, Nadine, it's every man and woman for his or her self. And it's time for your old friend Bob to take off. Maybe I'm changing in my Autumn years. ‘Cause I don't want to happen to me what's happened to you. Bob looks back to Dianne and Rick then back at Nadine.
11) 185) dialog: And Dianne, I don't think that she can put up with the straight life. So I guess I'm going alone.

11) 238) dialog: All my life.
11) 240) dialog: Well, since I've been twelve or thirteen I've been using narcotics. I guess you could say that was all my life.
11) 242) dialog: Twenty six.
11) 244) dialog: I don't know, curiosity I guess. I just thought I'd try it.
11) 246) dialog: Well, lady, you just found you one of those people what ain't got any other way to turn, so give me a jolt and let me go on my merry way.

11) 271) dialog: what do you mean?
11) 273) dialog: Why not?
11) 275) dialog: Well, not all the time. But I used all the time I was inside, I mean, what do you want, lady, my life story? Well, I'll tell it to you. I was a junkie. I liked dope. I liked the lifestyle. I was on top of it all but it wasn't real. You don't see my kind of people, because my kind of people don't come down here and beg dope. They go out and get it and if they miss, they go to jail and then they kick alone without nothing in some holding tank. 192 y-ib-b6 83
11) 277) dialog: (without hesitation) No, I don't think so, ma'am.
11) 279) dialog: Well, to begin with, no one, and I mean no one can talk a junkie out of using, so all your counseling is just wasted words and you might as well have flushed them down the toilet. A junkie needs his thing nine times out of ten just to be able to live with himself. He needs it just like a diabetic needs insulin. How are you going to sit and talk a diabetic out of using insulin?
11) 281) dialog: That really is a tough question, lady. I may think I know the answer, and then maybe I don't. When you ask a dope fiend why he uses, it's just about like asking a normal person why they like sex. And I suppose different people will come up with different answers, ranging from it just feels good, to I can't resist the urge, to it's all part of love, to I only do it to have children. Lady, a dope fiend will give you just about the same answers, with the exception of the last one. I've yet to hear a dope fiend claim he shot dope in an attempt to have children. INT.

12) 42) dialog: Thanks, Dianne. I sure do appreciate you all thinking of me.
12) 44) dialog: Yeah?
12) 46) dialog: No, baby, it wasn't you. It was Nadine's death and the hex that she threw on us with the hat. And then I panicked when I looked out into that parking lot and seen all those cop cars. I just knew I was dead. Everything up to then had gone wrong and so I started coping deuces. I prayed like never before. I said “God, Devil, Sun, whoever you are up there that controls this whirly-girly mad tumbling world, please have pity on me. Please let me get this poor girl's body out of yroLu-bo 91
12) 47) dialog: (continued) this motel room and into the ground so I don't have to spend the rest of my life in prison. And God, Sun, Satan, if you'll] do that for me, I'll show my appreciation by going back to the coast, getting on a methadone program, getting a job and living the good life." Well, I got out, and I promised, so here I am.
12) 49) dialog: Yeah. And, you know, for all the boredom the good life brings, it's not so bad. Even this crummy little room isn't so bad. I'ma regular guy. I got my regular job. And my regular room. Now I got my woman. . . Dianne sits down on the bed and sighs.

13) 7) dialog: I don't know exactly what's in it, but...
13) 9) dialog: I'm not so sure. I've come a long, weird road since I knew you as a kid, Tom. I took everything you told me and took it further. Hitting the poisons when everybody else was cleaning up, getting on the program. I hada good run, but people got hurt. People were 209 210 9-10-88 94
13) 10) dialog: (continued) shot, busted, people died. I can't do it anymore. The girl I married still thinks she's Ma Barker but I'm thinking like Pa Kettle. My cross-roading days are done, I guess I hope to never see another sitting-duck Pharmacy. And I have to confess I don't know what it was all for.
13) 15) dialog: I don't know what you're talking about. What do you want?
13) 17) dialog: Man, I ain't got no dope. You think I'd be living in this flea trap 1£ I had any dope? Hell, I'm on the methadone program, and you guys come to me to rob for dope? Boy, that sure is a laugh. 9-10-88 95 Bob tries to make his point by letting out a laugh, but it doesn't work. The laugh doesn't come out right. It sounds more like a howl.
