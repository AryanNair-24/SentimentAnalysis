60) 12) dialog: The targets went from Kissinger to the FBI. And the FBI illegally, unconstitutionally, and reprehensibly bugged and taped and secretly photographed and memorialized every move those people made. Them and their wives and their mistresses and homosexual lovers.
60) 14) dialog: Bill Sullivan. (which now makes perfect fucking sense) It became a rogue FBI operation. Sullivan drove it. Sullivan and the White House. By themselves.
60) 16) dialog: About everything else I knew every sordid little detail. But not this. They knew they couldn’t tell me about this.
60) 18) dialog: This is when the darkness started to creep in. This is when the rot started to happen. (and a long pause now, the Big Truth coming) The White House is packing all its crimes in separate little boxes ... (MORE )
60) 20) dialog: Watergate, the spying, the ugliness, the rot. Each thing in a different box so no one can put it together, so no one sees it’s all connected ... and no one will care. But it’s all the same big thing. Smith stares. Humbled by all this truth himself now, so--
60) 22) dialog: Do you know physics, Sandy? If you tap repeatedly on the post of a building, and the beating is relentless, it creates a rhythm, a resonance- (Felt starts to tap the table, slowly, repeatedly «+. tap ... tap ... tap) If you do that long enough, and steadily enough, it will feed-back, the frequencies will align ... the molecules will scramble ... and the whole thing - the whole building - will come apart from the inside and collapse in on itself. And all come tumbling down. (beat) The molecules are beginning to scramble. The FBI is coming apart. You know where that takes us? You want a country this big, this angry, this confused, without a police department? (--)
60) 23) text: Sometimes we have to betray the thing we love, to save the thing we love. Which triggers a momentary collapse in Felt. A slow eye- blink. He pats his own head. Then as quickly, embarrassed
60) 26) dialog: (tired) The White House is a syndicate, Sandy. It’s a criminal organization. (--)
61) 4) dialog: We've gone over everything. They’11l go easy; you’re the President's man. GRAY’S FLACK What about this? And pulls out the Smith TIME Magazine story. WE PUSH IN o the lead header: “Secret Wiretapping by the FBI”.

65) 0) text: Felt approaches the elevator doors. WE HEAR footsteps.
65) 2) text: They gonna let you keep your badge? (Felt turns now, imperious) You got a lotta people Washington worried. They think you're going to come out and unwrap everything. (MORE )
65) 3) text: 142 143 144 110. SULLIVAN (CONT’D) Everything from all the years. Everything we [you and I] know. (as Felt steps into the elevator)
65) 4) dialog: Is that what you want to know, Bill? This your last little errand? To help everyone sleep at night?
66) 0) text: Felt enters. Puts down his briefcase. Hangs up his hat an coat. Crosses to Audrey at the table. A day like any othe Felt sits in front of a tall Manhattan. Pulls at the drin He takes out his list of California commune addresses now spreads it out on the table between them. That one addres circled now: “Genesis Commune, Ben Lomand."
66) 1) dialog: I found her. (she goes still; a long beat; disbelief--)
66) 4) dialog: A week.
66) 8) dialog: It wasn’t safe.
66) 10) dialog: Let’s just go get our baby.
67) 8) dialog: Felt takes off his jacket, trades it for the baby. Felt l the baby to the sky, laughing. They turn and walk to Audrey. Felt holds the baby out to Audrey stares at the child. Hands pinned to her sides.
67) 10) dialog: This is your grandson. Felt presses the baby to Audrey’s breast, takes one of he arms and wraps it around the child.
67) 11) dialog: Audrey, this is Ludi.
67) 13) dialog: One didn’t come back. Felt opens his arms and pulls both his women into him. Th two women collapsing against each other.
67) 14) dialog: Whatever happened, whatever I did, whatever we did - or didn’t do - I’m sorry - we’re sorry. We need you. Your mother and I need you now. 146 113.

With her gloves and pill hat. Joan beside her. She’s a little drunk. Joan knows. Joan looks at her a lit sadly, then at Felt--
68) 3) text: When you were sick, and you were little, it was your father who climbed into bed with you. In his shoes. His holster. His suit. He’d sit with you for hours and rock you til you fell asleep again. Joan looks at Felt. As if to ask, what did you do?
68) 5) text: I wanted you to be [like me][a movie star]. They both watch Felt stroll. Joan touches her mother’s kn Connection. And pity.
69) 2) text: Joan and Gillies enter to find Felt sitting in the miniat room, an empty chair across from him.
69) 5) dialog: When did you graduate from law school?
69) 7) dialog: Have a seat. (when he’s down) I need to consult an attorney. (and hands him a dollar) I am now protected by attorney- client privilege. Whatever I say to you, you can never tell a living soul without my permission.
69) 9) dialog: Because you are now - as my lawyer - the only person in America I can trust. (and doesn’t quite know how to react to that strange and terrible irony) I’ve been in the FBI Longer than you've been alive. I live according to a code. There are things an FBI man does and doesn’t do. It’s black and white. (rambling) But there’s loyalty. And then there’s duty. There are things bigger than ourselves. Can you understand that?
69) 11) dialog: I’ve done something - things - that cannot be undone. But I want to know what I’ve done. (and looks up at him) Am I the man I think I am? Pause. Gillies takes in this man in obvious pain.
69) 13) text: You want to know who is going to forgive you. Felt looks through the slats in the barn wall. Catches fragments of Audrey quietly coming close, trying to hear.
69) 14) dialog: (realizing) I don’t need a lawyer. I need a priest. And now we begin to HEAR in PRE-LAP:

71) 1) text: Felt’s retirement party, subdued and sparsely attended.
71) 5) dialog: Mr. Lano.
72) 0) text: Felt - now in a suit - follows Lano across the lawn to a waiting car.
72) 1) dialog: What’s this really about? Lano cocks his head at the irony of the moment.
72) 3) dialog: I’ll take my car.
72) 5) dialog: I’m not getting in there with you.
72) 9) dialog: Sure he does.
73) 1) text: Beyond a rope barrier - ‘Restricted - Grand Jury and Witnesses Only’ - the hallway is populated by nervous FBI AGENTS and their LAWYERS. It’s quiet and tense. Felt approaches, marching down the hall. Charlie Bates, nervously smoking, intercepts.
73) 3) dialog: They're charging you? (and as Bates says nothing) Get out of my way, Mr. Bates. Felt marches for three FEDERAL PROSECUTORS huddling outsi the courtroom. All hungry Top Guns in their early 30's.
73) 4) dialog: Which one’s Pottinger? STAN POTTINGER, 33, hip-smart New Yorker turns.
73) 6) dialog: I’m going to testify.
73) 8) dialog: I’m aware of that. (looks over at Bates and a few others) They were following orders. Why don’t you go after the guy who was giving them?
73) 11) dialog: I am a lawyer.
73) 13) dialog: I don’t need one.
73) 17) dialog: I was keeping you and your kids safe at night. But what you’re doing-- (points at the agents) --is a witch-hunt. (his swagger) It happened. I made it happen. Put me on the stand. I’1l take my chances with the jury. 154 120.
74) 0) text: Felt ram-rod straight in the witness chair. Alone before 23 diverse and sleepy AMERICANS of the grand jury. We're deep into Felt’s testimony.

74) 6) dialog: I gave the order.
74) 8) dialog: I gave the order.
74) 11) dialog: I gave the order. Pause. Enough. Now Pottinger is up.
74) 13) dialog: I was in constant contact with the White House on many matters. And then this thing happens to Felt. For the first time h curtain of impenetrability drops. His eyes lose focus. He begins to sweat. His hands clench. Slacken. Clench, and--
74) 14) dialog: In fact, I was in the Oval Office so often people used to say I had to be Deep Throat. (a hesitation-what??-then)
74) 16) dialog: I said I was with the White House - Dean and so forth - so often people thought I was the Washington Post source for Watergate. The guy they called Deep Throat. Stop. Pottinger just stares. Confused by what he’s heard. Then, because he’s not sure what else to do--
74) 19) dialog: Was I what? (and who are you to ask me a thing--)
74) 21) dialog: (weak) No.

76) 1) text: Felt emerges first with Audrey and Joan, Millers next, th Gray and his wife. Long walk down a dark corridor. To meet 300 FBI AGENTS spilling into the street. There is no noise. This is eerie. Then they begin to CLAP unison, a long string of unending claps. As Felt steps in and through the crowd, across this tableau:
