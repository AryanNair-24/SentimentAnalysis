An S.S. driver stands at the car door. Harry and Stosh stand by the car, inspecting it. CAMERA MOVES ON PA the flagpole, against which leans Duke, and ON TO the por of the Administration Building: there stands Hoffy, readi the bulletin board. Only he isn't reading it. From one co of his eye he is peeking through the window into the  Kommandant's office. Suddenly he reacts to a movement ins Without turning, he gives the signal: he throws one end o his muffler around his neck. Duke, at the flagpole, gets it and throws his muffler aro his neck, thusly relaying the signal. At the car, Harry follows suit.

Hoffy, standing at the bulle board, WHISTLES a few bars of the Air Force song. Dunbar  turns, sees Hoffy whistling. Hoffy doesn't look at him, b Dunbar senses that something is in the wind. He walks on  between the S.S. Men. As he is being led toward the car,  still some thirty feet away, P.O.W.s crowd in to watch hi The Crutch, hobbling on from the direction of the latrine is some twenty feet from the car. Duke straightens up from the flagpole casually, and start sauntering toward the car. The latrine. Blondie and Bagradian have moved out of the  latrine and stand there with Marko, watching the car. Harry and Stosh at the car. Stosh tightening the belt of coat, Harry pulling the barracks cap tight on his head. The driver of the car opens the door. The S.S. Men and Du are some eight feet away now. The Crutch, hobbling past the car, releases a string and smudge pot drops as he moves on. He barely makes it. Almo instantly, there is a belch of fire and smoke starts pour out of the smoke bomb. The wind billows the smoke across the car, rapidly envelo the S.S. Men and Dunbar. There are German SHOUTS from wit the smoke cloud. Duke, Harry, Stosh, Blondie, Bagradian, Marko and Hoffy m into the smoke from all sides. All now is lost in smoke.  Just silhouettes of men rushing about. SHOUTS, German  commands, SOUNDS of scuffling. From OFF a siren starts to sound. German guards come running from all corners of the compound into the cloud. In the goon towers, the guards wheel around their machine guns, but don't dare to shoot into the smoke. From the Administration Building storms von Scherbach,  followed by the two Lieutenants, Schulz and other guards. They dash into the smoke cloud, which starts lifting.

Then Cookie. Then Triz and Blondie. The Joey, playing his ocarina in tune with the march, a smile his face. And Marko and The Crutch. Then Hoffy and Duke, all the others we have grown to know.
