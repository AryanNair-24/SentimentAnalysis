22) 9) dialog: Is that you, honey?
22) 10) text: Carnegie says nothing. Just paces angrily up and down. Finally Claudia turns to face him.
22) 12) dialog: Something wrong?
22) 16) dialog: Oh? It's been a while.
22) 19) text: Carnegie trails off, the thought too awful to contemplate Claudia adopts a sympathetic expression, supportive.
22) 21) dialog: You'll find what you're looking for. It's out there somewhere. You just have to have faith.
22) 32) text: He's in her face now. Claudia avoids eye contact, submiss
22) 37) dialog: I'm sorry.
26) 1) text: Carnegie has Claudia pinned against the wall, his pants bunched around his ankles, ass bared as he pounds away at her. Not making love. This is mechanical, loveless sex.
26) 2) text: Claudia stares vacantly over his shoulder into space as Carnegie thrusts into her again and again. Deeply uninterested, just waiting for it to be over.
26) 6) text: Claudia sees an opening to get out of this.
26) 8) dialog: Maybe you should go check.
26) 12) text: He pulls up his pants, grabbing a RIFLE propped by the do as he rushes out. Claudia just stands there for a moment, then reaches down and pulls up her panties.
28) 2) text: Standing at Carnegie's side are REDRIDGE and CLAUDIA.
31) 10) text: The door opens and CLAUDIA enters. Carrying a metal tub o water in both hands and, atop that, a dinner tray.
31) 12) dialog: I have this for you. Water for washing and some food.
31) 15) dialog: Well... are you going to take it?
31) 23) dialog: You're very welcome.
31) 24) text: We get the impression that Claudia is as unfamiliar with kind of polite interaction as Eli. But she likes it.
31) 26) dialog: It'll be dark soon.
31) 29) dialog: Can I get you anything else?
31) 33) dialog: Well. Have a good night.
31) 38) dialog: Why do you ask?
31) 41) text: Claudia smiles. Neither has she.
31) 43) dialog: He found me in the outland. I was sixteen, my family had been... well, they were gone. There was just me and my baby.
31) 47) dialog: I'd met some men on the road. Bad men. They...
31) 55) dialog: I was on the road for a year after that. I couldn't feed myself, let alone my little girl. And then Bill found us and he promised he'd take care of us. He told me he was going to make a place where we could be safe. And he did. He did all that. He built this whole town. He kept us safe. And he raised that child like she was his own. He's been so good to both of us. He saved us, really.
31) 56) text: There's a bittersweet quality to Claudia's words. As thou there is more to the story than she is telling.
31) 64) dialog: No, I was born this way. I think I'm lucky like that.
31) 68) dialog: It's not like I ever knew what I'm missing. I was already used to being like this by the time... by the time it all happened. So I got around pretty good even when I was on my own. And now it's easy. I know every creaky old floorboard in here, and it's not like I ever go any place else. Bill would never allow it. He worries about me so much.
31) 69) text: Again, bittersweet. The sense that Claudia feels trapped. Thinking about it begins to upset her. She gets up.
31) 71) dialog: I should go. He'll be wondering where I am.
31) 77) dialog: Thank you. I enjoyed our conversation.
32) 1) text: Carnegie washes, looking at himself in the old dressing-r mirror. He sees Claudia enter the room in its dim reflect
32) 4) text: A subtly accusing tone. It makes Claudia nervous.
32) 6) dialog: He wanted to talk.
32) 10) dialog: Nothing really. He asked me what it was like to be blind.
32) 14) dialog: No. I don't think he likes to talk about himself much.
32) 17) text: Claudia moves to the bedside, begins to undress.
32) 19) dialog: I don't think he's going to change his mind by morning. I don't think he's going to stay.
32) 26) dialog: Just strikes me as the kind of man who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't seem like the type to go changing it once it's set.
32) 30) dialog: You saw him. He's not like the others. You won't be able to smooth- talk him and wrap him around your finger like you usually do.
32) 33) text: Claudia reacts suddenly to this. Shocked and angry.
32) 35) dialog: You're doing what?
32) 38) dialog: You can't send her in there with him. He's dangerous, he's a killer!
32) 42) dialog: That's different. Solara's just a child, she can't-
32) 47) dialog: By working as a whore? That's all you think she's fit for?
32) 53) text: Claudia looks at Carnegie in disgust.
32) 55) dialog: What kind of a man are you?
32) 61) dialog: I don't live without fear. I haven't for a long time now.

32) 66) dialog: I'm not going to let you do this.
32) 67) text: Carnegie surges forward and pins Claudia to the wall.

46) 3) text: Claudia emerges from the theater with an ice-pack.
46) 41) text: As usual, Carnegie's slick rhetoric has worked - Redridge totally bought into it. Claudia, however, looks appalled.
46) 49) text: He reaches out and takes Claudia by the hand.
46) 66) dialog: What about Solara?
46) 69) dialog: She's still out there. With him.

91) 24) text: He swipes violently at the bible, knocking it out of Claudia's hands. He grabs it up and tries to rip it in tw but it's too thick to tear. Red-faced with rage, he tosse out over the box balcony. It lands somewhere in the dark auditorium below, between the rows of gutted theater seat
91) 25) text: As he paces angrily back past Claudia:
91) 27) dialog: Bill, is there something-
91) 30) text: He slumps in his chair, exhausted and furious. Claudia sa turns and leaves him alone with his thoughts.
94) 2) text: Carnegie sleeps soundly in bed. Next to him lies Claudia, wide awake. She checks that Carnegie is sound asleep, car not to wake him before she creeps out of bed and exits.
95) 1) text: Claudia is on her hands and knees in the darkness, search blindly in the aisles and beneath the theater seats.
95) 5) text: Sitting in the darkness, Claudia opens the book and runs fingers across the braille, reading. And though we can ba see in the dim light, we see the smile on her face. The j
