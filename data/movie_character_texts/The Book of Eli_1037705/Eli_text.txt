8) 10) dialog: I'm not going to hurt you.
8) 13) text: Eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spille contents. Steps forward and offers them to her.
8) 15) dialog: Here.
8) 22) text: Eli looks at the cart. It has come to rest in the ditch j inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road.
8) 23) text: He looks again at the girl. Her faded blouse is unbuttone revealing a little cleavage. Her skirt torn along the leg showing more than a little thigh. Almost deliberate.
8) 26) text: ELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl.
8) 28) dialog: One good thing about no soap any more. You can smell the road agents a mile off.

33) 2) text: Another KNOCK at the door. Eli jumps up and hurriedly hid the book inside his shirt.
33) 4) dialog: Come in.
33) 10) dialog: Someone was already here with food and water. I got everything I need.
33) 13) text: She glides into the room, closing the door. She's good. V seductive. Eli is totally disarmed in her presence.
33) 23) dialog: No. My name's Eli.
33) 27) dialog: Elijah.
33) 32) dialog: Look, I don't mean to be rude. But I'm really not interested.
33) 39) dialog: It's not that. You're a very nice girl. But I'm not that kind of man.
33) 45) dialog: I'm not.
33) 52) text: Eli opens the door for her.
33) 54) dialog: I'm sorry. Good night.

33) 59) dialog: If you don't, what?
33) 63) dialog: Who will? Carnegie?
33) 64) text: She nods, fighting back a tear. This angers Eli.
33) 66) dialog: Maybe he and I oughta have words.
33) 71) dialog: He's hurting you. He's hurting your mother. He's-

33) 77) text: She looks up at Eli imploringly. Transformed. No longer t teenage sex kitten. Now she's just a frightened little gi
33) 79) dialog: You want to have a conversation?
33) 86) text: Eli and Solara sit together on the bed. A silent BEAT. At first, it appears as though they have nothing to say.
33) 88) dialog: You know, you don't have to be afraid of me. What happened down there in the bar...
33) 92) dialog: How'd you know that?
33) 95) text: She smiles. Eli is surprised to find himself smiling back
33) 98) text: Eli smiles, amused by the bluntness of the question.
33) 102) dialog: You know, I don't rightly remember.
33) 105) text: Eli nods.
33) 108) text: Eli thinks about this. Dredging through old, old memories
33) 113) dialog: Better than this. (BEAT) People lived longer back then. Longer than me. Some were more than a hundred years old.
33) 118) dialog: I swear, it's true. Nowadays it's not the same. If you're sick or you're weak or you're old you won't last long out on the road.
33) 121) text: BEAT. Eli thinks. Should he or shouldn't he?
33) 123) dialog: Can I read you something?
33) 126) text: Eli pulls the book from his shirt. Solara's eyes widen.
33) 129) dialog: Not just any book.
33) 131) text: Eli opens it up, scans the page with his finger until he finds the passage he's looking for.
33) 133) dialog: The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in the paths of righteousness.
33) 134) text: ON SOLARA as she listens to Eli read. Transfixed.
33) 139) dialog: Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. For you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me, all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
33) 143) dialog: 
33) 148) dialog: I guess you could think of it that way. It's from the Holy Bible.
33) 151) text: BEAT as Eli thinks. How on earth to answer that?
33) 153) dialog: It's about love, and forgiveness, and life and death, and mercy, and revenge, and the beginning and the end of the world. I guess it's about a little bit of everything.
33) 160) dialog: I'm sorry. I'm charged to protect this book. I can't trust it with anyone. Not even for a while.
33) 166) text: BEAT. Eli runs his fingers across the embossed gold cross the beat-up leather cover.
33) 168) dialog: It's the last one. There are no other books like this. All the others are gone - destroyed by the war or in the burnings that came after. This is the only one that survived until now. The last one anywhere.
33) 172) dialog: I just know. (BEAT) For a long while after it happened, I just wandered on the road like most everybody else. There were still a lot of people around back then, in the beginning. I didn't really know what I should do or where I was going. I was just moving from place to place, trying to stay alive. And then one day I heard this voice. I don't know how to explain it, it's like it was coming from inside me. But I could hear it, clear as day. Clear as I can hear you talking to me now.
33) 176) dialog: It led me to this place, I don't really know where. And I found this book buried deep under some rubble. No way no-one was ever going to find it if they didn't know exactly where to look.
33) 180) dialog: That's right. And that voice told me to carry the book west.
33) 184) text: ELI (cont'd) It told me that a path would be laid out before me, that I'd be led to a place where this book would be safe. It told me I'd be protected against anyone or anything that tried to stand in my way. If only I would have faith. (BEAT) That was twenty-five years ago. And I've been walking ever since.
33) 188) dialog: I'm not crazy. I didn't imagine it. I know what I heard.
33) 191) text: BEAT as Eli considers his answer.
33) 193) dialog: A very important, very powerful man.
33) 197) dialog: (SMILES) I should say so, yes.
33) 202) dialog: What?
33) 206) dialog: I think you're probably right.
33) 213) dialog: I'm sorry. I'm leaving tomorrow. And I won't be back this way, ever.

33) 216) dialog: Are you hungry?
33) 220) dialog: There's some food on the table over there. Let's eat.
33) 221) text: She walks over to where the dinner tray is covered by a s cloth. She whips it away - to reveal ELI'S RAT nibbling o piece of cheese. Solara SHRIEKS and backs away.
33) 222) text: The rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto Eli shoulder, just as afraid of her as she is of it.
33) 224) dialog: It's okay, it's okay. He's with me. (to the rat) Don't be afraid, pal. This is Solara. She's our friend.
33) 227) dialog: It's okay. It means he likes you.
33) 230) dialog: Trust me, if he didn't like you, you'd know about it.
33) 235) dialog: Mean what?
33) 241) text: BEAT. Eli finds himself surprised that he admitted such a thing. When is the last time he had someone he could call friend? He can't even remember.
33) 243) dialog: Sure.
33) 245) text: Eli breaks the cheese in two and gives half to Solara. Sh about to eat but stops as Eli clasp his hands in prayer.
33) 247) dialog: Our father, we thank you for this meal which you have been so gracious to place before us.
33) 248) text: Unsure of what to do, Solara mimics Eli, putting her hand together and bowing her head.
33) 250) dialog: We thank you for a warm bed and a roof over our heads on a cold night such as this. (BEAT) And we thank you for the gift of friendship in these hard times.
33) 253) dialog: Amen. (BEAT) You say that last part too.
33) 257) dialog: And now we eat.

36) 1) text: Carnegie races across the landing, toward the ARMED GUARD posted outside Eli's bedroom. The guard steps aside as Carnegie flings the door open and barges inside.

38) 1) text: His hands shaking, the engineer disconnects Eli's battery from the generator and places it on the counter.
38) 2) text: Eli stands on the other side of the counter with his SHOT TRAINED RIGHT AT THE MAN'S HEAD. He takes the battery fro him and stuffs it into his backpack.
39) 1) text: Carnegie races from the lobby entrance and looks up at th open window to Eli's room. He could have easily jumped.
39) 16) text: They turn to face the engineer's storefront - just as ELI EMERGES ONTO THE STREET, shotgun still in his hand.
39) 19) text: Redridge draws and FIRES, SHATTERING A PARKING METER just inches from Eli and showering quarters all over the sidew
39) 20) text: Eli rushes along the sidewalk, RETURNING FIRE. The shot w Redridge in the shoulder. He goes down, wounded.
39) 21) text: Carnegie dives for cover as FOUR MORE GUNMEN rush from th theater. Carnegie waves frantically in Eli's direction.
39) 24) text: They spot Eli sprinting away and rush off in pursuit.
41) 2) text: CARNEGIE'S GUNMEN pursue, firing their rifles wildly on t run. The bullets splinter wood, pierce barrels and crates narrowly missing Eli as he dashes, keeping his head down.

41) 4) text: Eli hits the deck, diving for cover behind a JUNKPILE as gunfire ricochets all around him. He takes a moment to collect himself, reloads the shotgun.
41) 6) text: Eli signs a cross over himself with the shotgun, looks to sky and offers up a silent prayer. Then emerges from arou the junkpile back into the street. All three gunmen OPEN FIRE, their bullets whipping past on either side of him.
41) 10) text: In one swift motion Eli raises the shotgun and FIRES. Thr shots in quick succession. And then there is silence. Smo wisps from the shotgun's sawn-off barrel.
41) 12) text: Eli looks around. He's right at the end of the main road, perimeter where the town meets the open desert. He's free
41) 14) text: Eli whips around. In the upstairs window of the theater, Carnegie shoves Solara roughly against the wall. Barking angrily at her, shaking her.
41) 15) text: Eli looks at the road. Then up at the theater. Then back the road again.
41) 17) dialog: (quietly; to himself) It ain't your concern. Stay on the path.
41) 20) dialog: Dammit...
42) 2) text: He looks up just in time to see Eli coming right at him. Without breaking stride, he COLD-COCKS Redridge in the ja with the shotgun, sending him back to the deck, out cold.
43) 1) text: Eli kicks the door wide open, finds Carnegie holding Sola against the wall. She sobs, terrified. Eli levels the sho at Carnegie's head.
43) 3) dialog: Let her go.
43) 10) dialog: I reckon you're right.
43) 13) dialog: This, though? With this I'll shave the hairs clean off your balls at a hundred paces. You believe me?
43) 17) text: BEAT. Eli glances at Solara.
43) 21) dialog: No.
43) 22) text: Carnegie takes a small step forward. Suddenly, his whole demeanor changes, and he now looks at Eli imploringly.
43) 31) text: BEAT. Eli seems to be considering what he's heard careful
43) 33) dialog: The Lord himself told me that if I carried this book west, one day I would find the place where it was needed. Where it would be safe. Where it belonged.
43) 34) text: Carnegie smiles broadly... and then with a sudden blur of movement Eli PISTOL-WHIPS him to the floor.
43) 36) dialog: But this ain't it.
43) 39) dialog: Come on.
44) 1) text: Eli emerges from the theater, leading Solara onto the str RESIDENTS part before them, staring at Eli with astonishm

44) 12) text: Eli sheathes his sword and takes Solara by the hand again
44) 14) dialog: Now we can go.
45) 1) text: The town barely visible on the distant horizon behind Eli Solara. Eli walks as he always has, his pace steady and s Still, Solara lags along behind. She's already tired.
45) 5) dialog: I told you where I'm going. You're free to go wherever you want.
45) 10) dialog: You're only going to slow me down.
45) 11) text: Eli doesn't stop walking. Solara is forced to catch up.
45) 15) dialog: The man was hurting you. I don't like that, so I put a stop to it. Now you're free. He can't hurt you any more. (off her stare) No need to thank me.
45) 19) dialog: Whatever you want. That's what being free is.
45) 26) dialog: I have to get where I'm going. I can't be worrying about someone else along the way.
45) 30) text: BEAT. Eli stops and turns back to face her.
45) 32) dialog: It's dangerous in the outland. I wouldn't want you to get hurt.
45) 35) text: Eli sighs. He's not getting through to her. So now comes harsh truth of it:
45) 37) dialog: You don't want this life. I gotta do what I gotta do. Don't have no choice in it. But you do. And I can't let you choose this. You don't want to be like me. You don't want to spend your life alone.
45) 41) text: A long BEAT as Eli considers this. For a moment it appear though Solara might have won him over. But then:
45) 43) dialog: I'm sorry. Look, maybe it's best you just go on back to town.
46) 6) text: Carnegie applies it to his jaw, red and swollen from Eli' pistol-whip. Redridge appears nearby, his arm in a sling.
46) 36) text: CARNEGIE (cont'd) It has the power to motivate people. It can give them hope, it can terrify them. It can shape them. Control them. (BEAT) Do you remember how I built this town? It wasn't done with force, and it wasn't done just with water. It was done with the power of words. I created this place out of nothing, because people believed in a promise that I sold to them. Those guys on the TV, they were richer than you could ever dream, and it was all built the same way. With words. With promises. And with that book. (BEAT) That book is a weapon. Aimed right at the hearts and minds of the weak and the desperate. Just imagine what I could do with it.
48) 1) text: Eli walks on. Slow and steady. His gaze, as ever, fixed firmly on the horizon. Takes a swig from his canteen.
51) 27) text: Too   late. THREE ROAD BRIGANDS POUNCE FROM THE BUSHES. E bit   as brutish and horrifying as the group that Eli kil the   road in our opening. They grab Solara and drag her the   road into the desert, screaming and kicking all the

51) 67) text: Eli only had two arrows. He shoulders the bow and draws h sword. All the remaining brigand has is a small knife. Th two now square off at arm's length. A hopeless mismatch.

51) 71) text: Eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wound on the ground, but still breathing. He stands over their fallen bodies. They stare back up at him, helpless.
51) 74) dialog: I offer you both one final chance in this life to seek forgiveness for your sins so that your souls may find salvation. Will you say with me the act of contrition?
51) 78) text: Eli sighs. Stands and looks down on him without pity.
51) 80) dialog: Some might think it'd be most fitting to leave you here like this. Let you die slow in the sun. But I know better. I know where you're going. And the sooner you get there, the sooner you'll get what's coming to you.
51) 88) text: Eli pauses, sword hovering over him, poised to strike.
51) 91) text: Eli crouches once more by his side.
51) 93) dialog: Repeat after me. Oh God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee, and I detest all my sins.
51) 94) text: The bandit follows along with Eli, mouthing the words quietly. The life ebbing from him with each moment.

51) 100) text: Solara sits on the ground nearby, a wreck. Eli approaches gathers her up in his arms. She clings on to him tightly.
51) 104) dialog: What are friends for?

53) 12) dialog: It's good eating, is what it is.
53) 14) text: When she turns back, Eli is standing right there, holding dead animal in front of her face. She YELPS in surprise a staggers backward, falling on her butt.
53) 18) dialog: If you're going to be on the road, you can't be picky about what you eat. You eat what's there to eat.
53) 22) dialog: (SHRUGS) More for me.
54) 1) text: Eli and Solara sit in the mouth of a desert cave, around flickering campfire. The prairie dog roasts on a spit.
54) 2) text: Eli digs his knife into the carcass, the blade comes out clean. It's done. He clasps his hands together and gazes penitently at the ground.

54) 19) text: Eli reaches up and touches his hand to it.
54) 21) dialog: It's a Saint Christopher medal.
54) 24) text: Eli smiles and shakes his head.
54) 26) dialog: Christopher was a man who lived a long time ago. He wanted to be a good man, he wanted to help people. So he would stand by a river that had no bridge and carry people across. He was a big strong man and there was no one he couldn't carry.
54) 27) text: Solara listens, rapt. Eli is a good storyteller.
54) 29) dialog: Then one day a young child came to the river and asked to be carried across. Christopher tried to carry him but he was too heavy. He was just a small boy but he was heavier than any man he had ever carried. The boy explained that he was the son of God, and that he was so heavy because he bore all the sins of the world. After that, Christopher was able to carry him across and when they got to the other side the boy baptized him in the river. And that's how he became a saint. Later on, he was known as the patron saint of travelers.
54) 36) dialog: It's someone who spent their life doing good things for others. Enough that God himself took a special interest in them.
54) 37) text: Solara looks at Eli tenderly, with admiration.
54) 40) text: Eli looks away, down at the ground. He appears sad.

54) 47) dialog: It's late. You should get some sleep. Maybe tomorrow.
54) 50) text: The fire down to its last embers. Eli sleeps next to his pack, half-hidden in the looming shadows of the cave. His and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his swor
54) 51) text: Solara sleeps nearby... then opens her eyes. Not asleep a all. She looks over at Eli - his face hidden in shadow an impossible to tell if he's asleep or awake.
54) 54) text: No response. Quietly, she moves forward, kneeling by his side. She opens his coat and checks the pockets. Empty.
54) 55) text: She goes deeper, peeling back the layers of clothing, stealthily frisking him. She finds something on his lapel hidden under several layers, that causes her to stop.
54) 67) text: Suddenly, ELI'S HAND SHOOTS OUT AND GRABS HER BY THE WRIS She cries out, startled. Eli sits up, his face just a dar shape in the shadows. For the first time he appears a lit scary to Solara.

54) 73) dialog: On the road you sleep with one eye open. I asked you what you were doing.
54) 77) dialog: You want to see the book, you ask me. Nobody touches it but me. Ever. Until it gets where it's going. Do you understand?
54) 80) dialog: Tell me you understand!
54) 84) text: Eli releases her wrist. Takes the pack from her and close up. Pulls it closer to him and lies back down.

56) 14) dialog: By Almighty God.
56) 17) text: Eli wheels around and jabs a scolding finger at her.
56) 19) dialog: You want to stay on this road with me, don't ever let me hear you take his name in vain like that again.
56) 23) text: Eli resumes walking.
56) 28) dialog: God has a reason for everything being the way it is. It's not always apparent to us. But it is his plan nonetheless.
56) 32) dialog: It's not like that. It's kinda hard to explain. I'm guided by faith.
56) 35) text: BEAT as Eli thinks on how to explain it.
56) 37) dialog: It means you know something even though you don't know it.

57) 37) text: They step outside, regarding their new visitors carefully The man seems more suspicious than his wife. He drags Eli shotgun toward him with his foot, hands it to his wife.

57) 45) dialog: I'm sorry. We didn't think anybody lived here. We thought it was abandoned, like all the rest.
57) 51) dialog: No, sir. I... like what you've done with the place.
