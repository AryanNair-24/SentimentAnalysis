84) 14) dialog: Solara. What a delightful name. Is that by any chance Shakespearean?
84) 18) dialog: Wonderful.
84) 21) dialog: Is it true what they tell me? You have a King James Version?
84) 24) text: Solara looks at Eli, puzzled. Lombardi finds it hard to contain his excitement.
84) 26) dialog: My goodness. I can't tell you how exciting this is. Well, come, come!
84) 30) text: LOMBARDI (cont'd) I'll give you the nickel tour and then we can all sit down and take a look at it.
86) 1) text: What was once a cell block is now an IMMENSE LIBRARY. Sta floor to ceiling with books. Lombardi shows Eli and Solar around. Behind them, a pair of ARMED GUARDS follow closel
86) 3) dialog: Yes, we've been doing this for some time now. Collected over thirty thousand volumes from generous donors all across the nation. We even have a printing press that we hope to have operational soon.
86) 8) dialog: Well, not exactly. We're more like a storage facility. We're holding these books here in trust, if you like. When society gets back on its feet and no longer needs us to preserve these volumes, they'll be here waiting. (BEAT) I must ask you, how did you hear about us? We've been doing everything we can to get the word out, but we always like to know where our benefactors come from.
86) 11) text: Lombardi raises a quizzical eyebrow.
86) 16) dialog: Is that right? Well, it's good to know we're getting such high- profile referrals these days. (BEAT) I must say, I am so excited that we finally have a King James. You know, we have a Talmud here, we have two Korans, we even have that Scientology book. But never a Christian bible, until now. I honestly believed it was the one book I'd never see again, after what happened...
86) 17) text: BEAT. Lombardi appears sad for a moment.
86) 19) dialog: May I ask what condition it's in?
86) 23) dialog: Well, then. What say we take a look at it?
86) 24) text: Lombardi looks at Eli with anticipation. So does Solara, interested to know where this is going to go next.
86) 29) dialog: Of course. Right this way.
88) 1) text: Eli, Solara and Lombardi sit at one of the long lunch-roo tables. The two armed guards keep watch nearby.
88) 5) dialog: Mmm? Oh, yes of course!
88) 8) dialog: Could you please bring us some writing paper?
90) 1) text: The guard brings a THICK SHEAF OF WRITING PAPER to the cafeteria table, sets it down by Lombardi.
90) 5) dialog: What exactly am I writing?
90) 15) text: Lombardi hurriedly writes down every word.
92) 1) text: Some considerable time later. Great stacks of paper have filled with Lombardi's handwriting.
92) 2) text: Lombardi's pen races across the paper, struggling to keep with Eli's recitation.
96) 12) text: It's a NEW BIBLE. Crudely typeset from Lombardi's origina transcription and printed on the prison press.
96) 16) dialog: You know, you don't have to leave. You're welcome to stay here with us. You'll be safe.
96) 23) dialog: Where will you go?
