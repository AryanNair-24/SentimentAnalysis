Mako watches him through her peephole. Raleigh lifts his knuckles, about to knock on Mako's door Mako can't help but smile to herself as she watches him pause, just inches away. Raleigh stops. He rethinks it and finally folds his arms. Unsure of what he might say. He turns back to his room. His indecision teases a snicker from Mako's growing smile small sound, but Raleigh stops mid-step, and she quickly stifles her amusement - Did he hear that? Raleigh glances over his shoulder to take one last look a Mako's door - He thought he heard something. He waits and finally retreats to his room. Mako rests her back against the door.

The kaiju lets out a bone-shuddering SCREAM at her attack before launching into a full-on charge. Raleigh watches Invidia charge, slavering and savage. She seems to slow down as she draws closer.
