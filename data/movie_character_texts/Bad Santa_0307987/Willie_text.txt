Willie is in Home Improvement, flipping tools off the she into a cart of his own. Marcus is in Evening Wear, jumping to try to pull a stole off a mannequin. Willie batters a chisel into the seam of the safe door. Marcus continues to leap at the mannequin.

123) 1) dialog: Dear kid. I hope that you got my  present and that there wasn't too  much blood on it, although there was  blood on the present you gave me  which didn't keep me from enjoying  it, so maybe the blood doesn't matter  so much I guess.
123) 3) dialog: ...Anyway, just in case they took it  as evidence I am also sending you a  T-shirt. I hope it's the right size.

Anyways...

And now the cops  know I wrote it, which is gonna keep  my ass out of jail. That, plus  everyone agreeing that the Phoenix  police department shooting an unarmed  Santa was even more fucked-up than  Rodney King. The cops are treating  me like fucking royalty now which is  new in my experience. They are gonna  make me a sensitivity counselor so  that tragedies like this will never  again embarrass the whole fucking  department. Whatever.

They made her a Guardian  Pro-Temp or some such shit... anyway,  she makes better money than bartending  and seems to like you and your house  and Jacuzzi.
123) 9) dialog: ...So I'll be staying in Phoenix  now, telling the police how screwed- up they are which is not a bad job  as jobs go. They're supposed to let  me out of this hospital room soon so  I'll see you when I come over to  fuck Mrs. Santa's sister in the  Jacuzzi. Until then, don't take no  shit from nobody. Least of all  yourself. Anyways... see ya soon...
123) 11) dialog: ...Santa.
