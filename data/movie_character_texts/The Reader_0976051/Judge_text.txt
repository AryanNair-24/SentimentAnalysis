2) 246) dialog: The defendants, please. From being noisy and chaotic, the court is now silent.
2) 247) dialog: The first thing I’m going to do is hear motions from each of the defendants’ lawyers. (MORE )
2) 248) text: JUDGE (cont'd) They’re going to be arguing that there’s no reason to keep the defendants in jail until the outcome of the forthcoming trial. DIETER grins at MICHAEL in anticipation.
2) 249) dialog: I am going to take these cases one by one. MICHAEL is leaning down to get stuff out of his briefcase MARTHE shakes a pen which isn’t working.
2) 252) dialog: Hanna Schmitz. There is a row of six DEFENDANTS. The fifth woman is HANN her hair tied in a knot, her gaze fixedly into the middle distance, not looking towards the SPECTATORS. She is wear a grey dress with short sleeves. They all sit, sideways t the gallery. HANNA rises to her feet. The words seem to c very quietly, across a great distance.
2) 253) dialog: Your name is Hanna Schmitz?
2) 255) dialog: Can you speak louder please?
2) 257) dialog: Thank you. You were born on October 21st, 1922? 38.
2) 259) dialog: At Hermannstadt. And you’re now 43 years old?
2) 261) dialog: You joined the SS in 1943?
2) 263) dialog: What was your reason? What was your reason for joining? HANNA doesn’t answer.
2) 264) dialog: You were working at the Siemens factory at the time?
2) 266) dialog: You'd recently been offered a promotion. Why did you prefer to join the Ss? HANNA has a DEFENCE COUNSEL, a young man, beside her, who about to get up. But the JUDGE forestalls him.
2) 267) dialog: I’ll re-phrase my question. I’m trying to ascertain if she joined the SS freely. Of her own free will. Everyone waits.
2) 268) dialog: Well?
2) 270) dialog: Go on. 39.
2) 272) dialog: Did you know the kind of work you'd be expected to do?
2) 274) dialog: And you worked first at Auschwitz?
2) 276) dialog: Until 1944. Then you were moved to a smaller camp near Cracow?
2) 280) dialog: You then helped move the prisoners west in the winter of 1944 in the so-called death marches?
2) 324) dialog: Miss Schmitz, you're familiar with this book...
2) 326) dialog: Parts of it have already been read out in court. (MORE )
2) 327) text: JUDGE (cont'd) It’s an American publication, which has been translated. It’s by a survivor, a prisoner who survived, Ilana Mather...
2) 329) dialog: She was in the camp, wasn’t she, when she was a child? She was with her mother. The judge waits. HANNA seems arrogant, defiant.
2) 330) dialog: In the book, she describes a selection process. At the end of the month’s labour, every month, sixty inmates were selected. They were picked out to be sent from the satellite camp back to Auschwitz. That’s right, isn’t it?
2) 332) dialog: And so far, each of your fellow defendants has specifically denied being part of that process. Now I’m going to ask you. Were you part of it?
2) 334) dialog: So you helped make the selection?
2) 336) dialog: You admit that? Then tell me, how did that selection happen? HANNA shrugs slightly, as though it were obvious. 45.
2) 338) dialog: Are you saying your fellow defendants took part in the process?
2) 340) dialog: Even though they’ve denied it? But you admit it. You’re saying you took part in the process. The other DEFENDANTS stir with animosity, but the JUDGE i intent, following his own line. He waits.
2) 341) dialog: Did you not realise you were sending these women to their deaths? HANNA nods slightly.
2) 343) dialog: I’m not sure you understand...
2) 345) dialog: No, but what I’m saying : let me rephrase : to make room, you were picking women out and saying ‘You you and you have to be sent back to be killed.’ 46.
3) 8) dialog: In what way differently?
3) 13) dialog: I want to move on now to the march. As I understand it, you and your daughter were marched for many months.
3) 15) dialog: Please tell us about the night in the church. MICHAEL watches as ROSE looks across to ILANA. ILANA star back at her. MICHAEL watches the exchange as ROSE nods, a accepting she must go ahead and speak.
3) 17) dialog: The church burned down? Nobody came to open the doors? Is that right?
3) 19) dialog: Even though you were all burning to death? ROSE nods.
3) 20) dialog: How many people were killed?
3) 22) dialog: How did you survive?
3) 24) dialog: Thank you. I want to thank you for coming to this country today to testify.
3) 50) dialog: Why did you not unlock the doors? He waits. HANNA doesn’t reply.
3) 51) dialog: Why did you not unlock the doors? The JUDGE turns to the row of DEFENDANTS.
3) 52) dialog: I’ve asked all of you and I’m getting no answer. Two of the victims are in this court. They deserve an answer. ILANA and ROSE are not far away from MICHAEL and the STUDENTS. The JUDGE puts down a bound handwritten documen
3) 53) dialog: Here, this is the SS report. You all have copies. There is a flurry of paperwork among the DEFENDANTS and LAWYERS as they turn to their copies. 53.
3) 54) dialog: This is the report which was written, approved and signed by all of you immediately after the event. In the written report, you all claim you didn’t even know about the fire until after it happened. But that isn’t true, is it? The JUDGE waits.
3) 55) dialog: Well? It isn’t true.
3) 57) dialog: The first thing I’m asking is, why didn’t you unlock the doors? HANNA takes a look to the other DEFENDANTS. For the first time her poise is crumbling.
3) 59) dialog: Why? Why couldn’t you?
3) 61) dialog: I see. And if they escaped, then you'd be blamed, you’d be charged, you might even be executed?
3) 63) dialog: Well then? The JUDGE waits.
3) 66) dialog: So you did know what was happening? You did know? You made a choice. You let them die rather than risk letting them escape. HANNA can’t answer - she has no answer.
3) 67) dialog: The other defendants have made an allegation against you. Have you heard this allegation? HANNA does not reply.
3) 68) dialog: They say you were in charge.
3) 70) dialog: Did you write the report?
3) 73) dialog: Is that true?
3) 75) dialog: I need to see a sample of your handwriting.
3) 77) dialog: Yes. I need to establish who wrote the report. At once HANNA’S COUNSEL rises.
3) 79) dialog: Somebody take her this piece of paper.
3) 81) dialog: Give her the paper. Counsel, approach the bench. A piece of paper and a pen are put down in front of HANNA Her COUNSEL moves to the bench. MICHAEL stares, first at then at the pen and paper, an apprehension rising in him.
3) 125) dialog: The court finds guilty the defendants Rita Beckhart, Karolina Steinhof, Regina Kreutz, Angela Zieber, Andrea Luhmann jointly aiding and abetting murder in three hundred cases. The court finds the defendant Hanna Schmitz guilty of murder in three hundred cases. There are tears in MICHAEL’s eyes as he watches.
3) 126) dialog: The court sentences the accused as follows. Rita Beckhart, Karolina Steinhof, Regina Kreutz, Angela Zieber, and Andrea Luhmann, you will each serve a total sentence in prison of four years and three months. ROHL, MARTHE, DIETER and the students are looking down on sentencing. MICHAEL is crying.
3) 127) dialog: Hanna Schmitz, in view of your own admissions and your special role, you are in a different category. The court sentences the accused Schmitz to imprisonment for life. HANNA is impassive, not reacting. Then she turns and look to the gallery.
