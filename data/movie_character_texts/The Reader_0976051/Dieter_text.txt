2) 248) text: JUDGE (cont'd) They’re going to be arguing that there’s no reason to keep the defendants in jail until the outcome of the forthcoming trial. DIETER grins at MICHAEL in anticipation.
2) 286) dialog: I thought it was exciting.
2) 288) dialog: Yes.
2) 290) dialog: Because it’s justice.
2) 297) dialog: I’d have thought it was obvious.
2) 299) dialog: Cowardice. It’s cowardice, isn’t it? It’s bad conscience. It’s the big cover-up.
2) 301) dialog: After the war. The German people didn’t want to look at what they’d done.
2) 303) dialog: Because they had too much to hide. All our parents are liars. All right, mine are. So it’s left to us, isn’t it?
2) 305) dialog: Because we're not implicated.
2) 313) dialog: If you want to know, he was in the Waffen SS. There are some smiles, but DIETER rides over the reaction
2) 314) dialog: That’s what I mean, that’s what I’m saying. So were a million other Germans.
2) 318) dialog: But isn’t that...
2) 320) dialog: Narrow?
3) 26) dialog: I don’t know. I don’t know what we're doing any more.
3) 28) dialog: You keep telling us to think like lawyers, but there’s something disgusting about this. ROHL is very still, like an analyst who is finally leadin his patient to the heart of things.
3) 30) dialog: This didn’t happen to the Germans. It happened to the Jews. Everyone is shocked at his violent passion.
3) 31) dialog: What are we trying to do?
3) 33) dialog: Six women locked three hundred Jews in a church, and let them burn. What is there to understand? Tell me, I’m asking : what is there to understand? MICHAEL can’t answer. DIETER gets up, outraged now.
3) 34) dialog: I started out believing in this trial, I thought it was great, now I think it’s just a diversion.
3) 36) dialog: You choose six women, you put them on trial, you say ‘They were the evil ones, they were the guilty ones’. Brilliant! (MORE )
3) 37) text: DIETER (cont'd) Because one of the victims happened to write a book! That’s why they’re on trial and nobody else. Do you know how many camps there were in Europe? DIETER turns, furious.
3) 38) dialog: People go on about how much did everyone know? ‘Who knew?’ ‘What did they know?’ That isn’t the question. The question is ‘How could you let it happen?’ And - better - ‘Why didn’t you kill yourself when you found out?’ One of the group walks out.
3) 39) dialog: Thousands! That’s how many. There were thousands of camps. Everyone knew. DIETER’S passion is so great that everyone is shaken.
3) 40) dialog: Look at that woman...
3) 42) dialog: The woman you’re always staring at. I’m sorry but you are. MICHAEL is white. The atmosphere is electric.
