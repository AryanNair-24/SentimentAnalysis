3) 13) dialog: I don't want to be spared if you aren't! And you spare me nothing.
3) 16) dialog: Perhaps perhaps it's the assault on Wilmington port. You dream about the ship before a battle, usually. 8.
3) 22) dialog: Beyond description.
3) 25) dialog: Almost two years, nothing mends. Another casualty of the war. Who wants to listen to a useless woman grouse about her carriage accident?
3) 29) dialog: Stuff! You tell me dreams, that's all, I'm your soothsayer, that's all I am anymore, I'm not to be trusted with - Even if it wasn't a carriage accident, even if it was an attempted assassination -
3) 33) dialog: It was an assassin. Whose intended target was you.
3) 37) dialog: I don't want to talk about parties! You don't care about parties.
3) 42) dialog: I know...I know what it's about. The ship, it isn't Wilmington Port, it's not a military campaign! It's the amendment to abolish slavery! Why else would you force me to 9.
3) 47) dialog: You're going to try to get the amendment passed in the House of Representatives, before the term ends, before the Inauguration.
3) 53) dialog: No one's loved as much as you, no one's ever been loved so much, by the people, you might do anything now. Don't, don't waste that power on an amendment bill that's sure of defeat.
3) 56) dialog: Did you remember Robert's coming home for the reception?
3) 59) dialog: I knew you'd forget.
3) 62) dialog: That's the ship you're sailing on. The Thirteenth Amendment. You needn't tell me I'm right. I know I am.
16) 25) dialog: He's here... (calling down the hall:) He's here, Mrs. Cuthbert! He's here!
16) 31) dialog: 
16) 38) dialog: 
16) 44) dialog: Tell him anyway.
16) 47) dialog: You forget to eat, exactly like him.
16) 52) dialog: You'll linger a few days extra, after the reception, before you go back to school.
16) 57) dialog: We'll fatten you up before you return to Boston.
16) 61) dialog: All right. (beaming at him,
36) 6) dialog: My head hurts so.
36) 11) dialog: Trying not to think about him. How will I manage?
36) 16) dialog: 
36) 21) dialog: I knew, I knew, I saw that night he was dying.
36) 25) dialog: But I saw Willie was dying. I saw
37) 18) dialog: Senator Sumner, it has been much too long.
37) 23) dialog: And...?
37) 29) dialog: (her Southern accent becoming more lustrous:) Praise Heavens, praise Heavens, just when I had abandoned hope of amusement, it's the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee!
37) 35) dialog: Madame President if you please!
37) 41) dialog: I'll take your word for that, sir!
37) 45) dialog: You have always taken such a lively, even prosecutorial interest in my household accounts.
37) 49) dialog: Yes, thank you, it's true, the miracles I have wrought out of fertilizer bills and cutlery invoices. But I had to! Four years ago, when the President and I arrived, this was pure pigsty. Tobacco stains in the turkey carpets. Mushrooms, green as the moon, sprouting from ceilings! And a pauper's pittance allotted for improvements. As if your committee joined with all of Washington awaiting, in what you anticipated would be our comfort in squalor, further proof that my husband and I were prairie primitives, unsuited to the position to which an error of the people, a flaw in the democratic process, had elevated us. 57.
37) 53) dialog: The past is the past, it's a new year now and we are all getting along, or so they tell me. I gather we are working together! The White House and the other House? Hatching little plans together?
37) 58) dialog: What?
37) 62) dialog: Oh!
39) 6) dialog: Make time to talk to Robbie. You only have time for Tad.
39) 10) dialog: So's Robert. Too young for the army.
39) 14) dialog: Don't take Robbie. Don't let me lose my son.
39) 17) dialog: Go away! We're occupied!
57) 37) dialog: (whispering to Mrs.
62) 6) dialog: The war will take our son! A sniper, or a shrapnel shell! Or typhus, same as took Willie, it takes hundreds of boys a day! He'll die, uselessly, and how will I ever forgive you? Most men, their firstborn is their favorite, but you, you've always blamed Robert for being born, for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief and caused you regret! 85.
62) 11) dialog: And if the slaughter of Cold Harbor is on your hands same as Grant, God help us! We'll pay for the oceans of spilled blood you've sanctioned, the uncountable corpses we'll be made to pay with our son's dear
62) 17) dialog: (with a mocking smile:) And if I refuse to take the high road, if I won't take up the rough old cross, will you threaten me again with the madhouse, as you did when I couldn't stop crying over Willie, when I showed you what heartbreak, real heartbreak looked like, and you hadn't the courage to countenance it, to help me -
62) 19) dialog: That's right. When you I was in the room with refused so much as to comfort Willie, I was holding him i Tad - my arms as he died!
62) 22) dialog: - the child who was not only How dare you! sick, dangerously sick, but beside himself with grief?
62) 25) dialog: Oh but your grief, your How dare you throw that at grief, your inexhaustible me?! grief! 86.
62) 28) dialog: And his mother won't let him I couldn't let Tad in! I near her, `cause she's couldn't risk him seeing how screaming from morning to angry I was! night pacing the corridors, howling at shadows and furniture and ghosts! I ought to have done it, I ought have done for Tad's sake, for everybody's goddamned sake, I should have clapped you in the madhouse!
62) 30) dialog: THEN DO IT! Do it! Don't you threaten me, you do it this time! Lock me away! You'll have to, I swear, if Robert is killed!
63) 5) dialog: You think I'm ignorant of what you're up to because you haven't discussed this scheme with me as you ought to have done. When have I ever been so easily bamboozled?
63) 10) dialog: No one ever lived who knows better than you the proper placement of footfalls on treacherous paths. Seward can't do it. You must. Because if you fail to secure the necessary votes, woe unto you, sir. You will answer to me.
94) 3) dialog: You've an itch to travel?
94) 7) dialog: (shaking her head no:) Overseas.
94) 11) dialog: (a laugh, then:) Awfully pious for a man who takes his wife out buggy-riding on Good Friday.
94) 16) dialog: All anyone will remember of me is I was crazy and I ruined your happiness.
94) 22) dialog: When they look at you, at what it cost to live at the heart of this, they'll wonder at it. They'll wonder at you. They should. But they should also look at the wretched woman by your side, if they want to understand what this was truly like. For an ordinary person. For anyone other than you.
