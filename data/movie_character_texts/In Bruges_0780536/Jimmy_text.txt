The phone is still ringing. He puts a couple of ice-cubes from the tray beside his be into his glass, pours some whisky in and drinks. The phon finally stops ringing. RAY gets up, still in pain, and moves across the room, passing another newspaper headline on the wall reading ‘S NO CLUES IN MURDER OF LITTLE TOBIAS’ along with a large h picture of the little boy from the church. Also pinned to wall is the LITTLE BOY’s confession note. As we see these, we hear RAY open a cupboard and take something metallic out. Phone starts ringing again.
