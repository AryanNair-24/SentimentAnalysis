1) 3) text: FRANK WHEELER, intelligent good-looks, and APRIL JOHNSON, patrician beauty, a woman amongst girls. He's been making her laugh.
29) 18) text: MRS. GIVINGS Oh... yes, I almost forgot. I do have a small favor I'd like to ask... (quiver of anxiety ) It's about my son, John. He's been in the hospital.
59) 6) text: Out steps JOHN, 30's, an institutional haircut and ill- fitting suit. He looks around the sunny neighborhood.
60) 13) text: John stands by himself closest to the door.
60) 14) text: APRIL And you must be John?
60) 16) text: MRS. GIVINGS Say hello, John.
60) 20) text: JOHN Nice to meetcha.   Heard a lot aboutcha.
60) 21) text: John smiles, exposing a mouthful of deeply-stained yellow teeth and high, eroded gums.
61) 4) text: John walks around the room, stiff-legged, examining the b shelves, the paintings.
61) 5) text: JOHN Don't worry. If I had a certified lunatic coming around the house, I'd probably get the kids out of the way too.
61) 9) text: April lifts the plate and offers it to John.
61) 10) text: APRIL (CONT'D) John, would you like a sandwich?
61) 12) text: JOHN Helen's been talking it up about you people for months. (MORE)
61) 15) text: JOHN (CONT'D) The nice young Wheelers on Revolutionary Road, the nice young Revolutionaries on Wheeler road.
61) 19) text: JOHN I'd like some sherry. And I'll drink Helen's if she doesn't beat me to it.
61) 22) dialog: (suddenly serious) But, hey... Listen, though. You got a high-ball glass...? Put a couple-three ice cubes in it, pour it up to the brim. That's the way I like it.
61) 26) text: Frank hands John his high-ball glass.
61) 27) text: JOHN You a lawyer Frank?
61) 29) text: JOHN I could use a lawyer.
61) 33) text: MR. GIVINGS John, let's not get started again about the lawyer.
61) 34) text: JOHN Pop, couldn't you just sit there and eat your wonderful egg salad, and quit horning in?
61) 36) text: JOHN (CONT'D) See, I've got a good many questions to ask and I'm willing to pay for the answers... Now, I don't need to be told that a man who goes after his mother with a coffee table is putting himself in a weak position legally; that's obvious.
61) 38) text: MRS. GIVINGS John, come and have a look out this fabulous picture window.
61) 40) text: JOHN If he hits her with it and kills her, that's a criminal case.
61) 42) text: JOHN If all he does is break the coffee table and give her a certain amount of aggravation and she decides to go to court over it, that's a civil case.
61) 43) text: MRS. GIVINGS Maybe we'll see a rainbow!   John, come have a look.
61) 47) text: JOHN Ma, how about doing everybody a favor? How about shutting up!
61) 52) text: John stares at Frank for any sign of condescension.
61) 53) text: JOHN So, what do you do, Frank?
61) 55) text: JOHN You design the machines?
61) 58) text: JOHN Make `em, sell `em, repair `em?
61) 62) text: JOHN Whaddya do it for then?
61) 67) text: JOHN Okay, okay, okay В­ I know it's none of my business. And besides, I know the answer. You want to play house, you got to have a job. You want to play very nice house, very sweet house, then you got to have a job you don't like. Anyone comes along and asks "Whaddya do it for?' he's probably on a four-hour pass from the State funny farm. All agreed...? Ma?
61) 69) text: John smiles his yellow grin.
61) 71) text: FRANK Don't be. I agree with everything you said, John. We both do. That's why I'm quitting the job in the fall and we're taking off.
61) 73) text: John looks over at his mother.
61) 74) text: JOHN Did you know about this, Ma...? Wow. How do you feel about that, Ma? The nice young Wheelers are taking off!
61) 75) text: John bursts into a painful braying laugh.   It goes on an
61) 80) text: MRS. GIVINGS ...John, please.
61) 83) text: FRANK How about some fresh air, John?
61) 84) text: John stops laughing abruptly.    He looks to his parents.
61) 87) text: MR. GIVINGS ...If John wants to, I don't see the harm.
62) 1) text: Frank, April and John walk through the woods.
62) 3) text: John buttons up his top button and pulls his sleeves down over his hands.
62) 5) text: JOHN You hear wrong.     It's all gone now.
62) 8) text: JOHN You know what electrical shock treatments are?
62) 14) text: JOHN I've had thirty-seven.
62) 17) dialog: See?
62) 19) text: JOHN (CONT'D) Supposed to jolt out the `Emotional Problems.' Just jolted out the mathematics.
62) 22) text: JOHN (mimicking) `How awful...' Why, because mathematics is so `interesting?'
62) 24) text: John stares at April.    He smiles.
62) 25) text: JOHN I like your girl, Frank.
62) 28) text: JOHN So, what do a couple of people like you have to run away from?
62) 33) text: John comes to a stop.
62) 34) text: JOHN And what's in Paris?
62) 37) text: JOHN The hopeless emptiness? Now, you've said it. Plenty of people are on to the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness... Wow.
62) 38) text: John continues walking.   Frank and April watch him go.
84) 10) text: John looks up.
84) 15) text: JOHN Hold it a second, Ma.
84) 16) text: John gets to his feet.
84) 17) text: JOHN (CONT'D) I don't get this.
84) 19) text: JOHN (CONT'D) What's so obvious about it? I mean okay, she's pregnant; so what? Don't people have babies in Europe?
84) 25) text: John holds up a hand.
84) 26) text: JOHN I'm asking the man a question. If he doesn't want to give me the answer, I'm assuming he'll have sense enough to tell me so.
84) 28) text: JOHN (nods slowly) Okay. Okay; it's a question of money. Money's always a good reason...
84) 29) text: John paces the room, with his hands behind his back like detective at a murder scene.
84) 30) text: JOHN (CONT'D) But it's hardly ever the real reason. What's the real reason? Wife talk you out of it, or what?
84) 32) text: JOHN (CONT'D) Little woman decide she isn't quite ready to quit playing house?
84) 34) text: JOHN (CONT'D) Nah, nah, that's not it. I can tell. She looks too tough. Tough and female and adequate as hell.
84) 39) text: JOHN (CONT'D) Okay, then; it must've been you.
84) 41) text: JOHN (CONT'D) What happened?
84) 42) text: MRS. GIVINGS John, please, you're being very --
84) 43) text: John holds up his hand.
84) 44) text: JOHN What happened, Frank? You get cold feet, or what? You decide you're better off here after all? You figure it's more comfy here in the old Hopeless Emptiness after all, or --
84) 46) text: JOHN (CONT'D) Wow, that did it! Look at his face! What's the matter, Wheeler? Am I getting warm?
84) 47) text: Frank stares at John, his rage increasing.   Mr. Givings to his feet.
84) 49) text: JOHN Boy!
84) 51) text: JOHN (CONT'D) Boy! You know something? I wouldn't be surprised if you knocked her up on purpose just so you could spend the rest of your life hiding behind that maternity dress. That way you never have to find out what he's made of.
84) 60) text: Mr. Givings moves John towards the door. Mrs. Givings slo stands. April is the only one left seated.
84) 61) text: JOHN Big man you got there, April.
84) 63) text: JOHN (CONT'D) Big family man, solid citizen. I feel sorry for you. Still, maybe you deserve each other.
84) 65) text: JOHN (CONT'D) Matter of fact, the way you look right now, I'm beginning to feel sorry for him, too. I mean, you must give him a pretty bad time, if making babies is the only way he can prove he's got a pair of balls.
84) 70) text: Frank lunges at John. Mr. Givings tries to hold Frank bac Mrs. Givings leaps between them. She's crying.
84) 73) text: MR. GIVINGS All right, John. Let's get on out to the car now.
84) 76) text: JOHN Right... Sorry, sorry, sorry! Okay Ma? Have I said `Sorry' enough times? I am sorry, too. Damn; I bet I'm just about the sorriest bastard I know. Course, get right down to it, I don't have a whole hell of a lot to be glad about, do I?
84) 78) text: JOHN (CONT'D) Hey, but I'm glad about one thing, though.
84) 80) text: JOHN (CONT'D) You know what I'm glad about? I'm glad I'm not gonna be that kid.
