4) 5) text: MR. AND MRS. GIVINGS, an older couple, are standing in hi way.
4) 6) text: MRS. GIVINGS Frank! Very nice Frank!
4) 7) text: FRANK Thanks, Mrs. Givings.
4) 9) text: MRS. GIVINGS I can't tell you how much we enjoyed it. You have a very talented wife.
24) 1) text: Mrs. Givings sits behind the wheel, driving slowly along suburban street talking at high speed.
24) 3) text: We don't yet see what Mrs. Givings is describing, only as plays on their faces.
24) 8) dialog: Of course, I knew the moment you came off the train what you were looking for... A small remodeled barn, or a carriage house В­ And I just hate to be the one to tell you that sort of thing just isn't available anymore... But I don't want you to despair. There is one place down here I want to show you... Now of course it isn't very desirable at this end. (gestures) As you see, Crawford Road is mostly these little cinder-blocky, pick-up trucky places В­ plumbers, carpenters, little local people of that sort.
24) 10) text: MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) But eventually... (she points, her arm fully extended) Eventually it leads up to Revolutionary Road, which is much nicer. Now, the place I want to show you, is a sweet little house and a sweet little setting. Simple, clean lines, good lawns, marvelous for children. It's right around this next curve... Now, you'll see it В­ there.
24) 12) text: MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) See the little white one? Sweet isn't it? The perky way it sits there on its little slope? Charming, isn't it?
29) 3) dialog: Yoo-hoo!
29) 4) text: She turns to see Mrs. Givings at the screen door.
29) 8) text: MRS. GIVINGS I can't stay a minute... My, don't you look comfy! I just wanted to bring this sedum for that messy patch in the front yard.
29) 13) text: MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) All it wants is just a tiny dollop of water for the first few days, and you'll find it absolutely thrives.
29) 15) text: MRS. GIVINGS Only if you're having some.
29) 18) text: MRS. GIVINGS Oh... yes, I almost forgot. I do have a small favor I'd like to ask... (quiver of anxiety ) It's about my son, John. He's been in the hospital.
29) 20) text: MRS. GIVINGS Well, actually, just for the present, he's in Pleasant Brook... Psychiatric.
29) 23) text: MRS. GIVINGS Oh... Nothing serious. He just got a little run down. Things can just get the better of us sometimes. Don't you think?
29) 29) text: Mrs. Givings smiles. Then, pretending to read the titles a stack of books on the table...
29) 30) text: MRS. GIVINGS It really is a marvellous facility and the treatments seem to be doing him wonders... Anyway, they said getting out for an afternoon might do him some good.
29) 32) text: MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) I think he finds my friends a little conventional, frankly. I mean, he's travelled. He has a PhD in mathematics. I suppose you could say he's an intellectual. It would do him a world of good to meet a young couple like you.
29) 34) text: MRS. GIVINGS So, I thought perhaps if you had some time...
29) 36) text: MRS. GIVINGS (flushed with relief) Thank you, dear... Thank you.
29) 38) text: MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) I remember when you first came off the train. You weren't like most of my clients. You were different, somehow.
29) 43) text: MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) Well, you looked simply ravishing and I just knew Frank did something terribly brilliant in town. You just seemed... special... Of course you still are.
30) 1) text: April watches from the picture window as Mrs. Givings wal down the drive towards her car. Her face is reflected in glass. Something is taking shape in her mind.
59) 2) text: Mrs. Givings gets out of the car holding a tinfoil covere baking pan. Mr. Givings opens the backseat.
60) 3) text: MRS. GIVINGS Sorry to be late.
60) 5) text: MRS. GIVINGS The traffic was terrible.
60) 7) text: MRS. GIVINGS Wasn't it terrible, Howard?
60) 16) text: MRS. GIVINGS Say hello, John.
61) 1) text: Mrs. Givings leads the group into the living room.
61) 2) text: MRS. GIVINGS Where are your darling children?
61) 7) text: MRS. GIVINGS Oh, look at all this food! You didn't have to go to any trouble for us.
61) 18) text: MRS. GIVINGS Please, don't bother Frank.
61) 25) text: MRS. GIVINGS Oh, this is the most wonderful egg salad, April. You must tell me how you fix it.
61) 38) text: MRS. GIVINGS John, come and have a look out this fabulous picture window.
61) 39) text: Mrs. Givings gets up and goes to the window.
61) 41) text: MRS. GIVINGS Oh, look, the sun's coming out!
61) 43) text: MRS. GIVINGS Maybe we'll see a rainbow!   John, come have a look.
61) 50) text: With her back to the room, Mrs. Givings closes her eyes.
61) 59) text: MRS. GIVINGS All these questions.
61) 61) text: MRS. GIVINGS Oh, Frank...
61) 76) text: Mrs. Givings brings a hand to her brow - she's on the ver of tears.
61) 80) text: MRS. GIVINGS ...John, please.
61) 86) text: MRS. GIVINGS I don't know if it's a good idea.
83) 58) dialog: Yoo-hoo!   Any one home?
84) 6) text: MRS. GIVINGS Oh, don't worry. It's nice just to sit for a bit and socialize...You really didn't need to go through all the trouble of cooking. I can see you have a lot to do with packing and what not.
84) 9) text: MRS. GIVINGS Oh?
84) 14) text: MRS. GIVINGS Oh, April! I can't tell you how pleased I am. Oh, but I expect you'll be needing a bigger house, now, won't you?
84) 24) dialog: Oh John, really. I don't think we need to --
84) 42) text: MRS. GIVINGS John, please, you're being very --
84) 56) text: MRS. GIVINGS He's not well, Frank.
84) 60) text: Mr. Givings moves John towards the door. Mrs. Givings slo stands. April is the only one left seated.
84) 70) text: Frank lunges at John. Mr. Givings tries to hold Frank bac Mrs. Givings leaps between them. She's crying.
84) 71) text: MRS. GIVINGS He's not well, Frank!
84) 75) text: MRS. GIVINGS I'm sorry April, I'm so sorry...
117) 1) text: Mrs. Givings crouches on a cotton work sheet painting var onto a chair. Mr. Givings sits reading the paper.
117) 3) text: MRS. GIVINGS I can't tell you how pleased I am about the little Revolutionary Road place, Howard. Remember how dreary it looked all winter? All cold and dark and -- well, spooky. Creepy- crawly. And now whenever I drive past, it gives me such a lift to see it all perked up and spanking clean again, with lights in the windows. And do you know, I was just thinking, I've loved that little house for years, and the Braces are the first really suitable people I've ever found for it. Really nice, congenial people, I mean.
117) 6) text: MRS. GIVINGS Oh, I was very fond of the Wheelers but they always were a bit -- a bit whimsical, for my taste. A bit neurotic. I may not have stressed it, but they were often very trying people to deal with, in many ways. (MORE)
117) 9) text: MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D) Actually, the main reason the little house has been so hard to sell is that they let it depreciate so dreadfully. Warped window frames, wet cellar, crayon marks on the walls, filthy smudges around all the--
117) 11) text: He gazes out the window as behind him Mrs. Givings contin to talk, but we can't hear a thing.
