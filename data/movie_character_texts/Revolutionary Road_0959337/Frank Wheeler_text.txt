66) 31) text: BART POLLOCK A personal thing? I see. (looks down, clearly disapproving) Frank... Let me tell you something my father told me... A man only gets a couple chances in life. If he doesn't grab `em by the balls, it won't be long before he finds himself sitting around wondering how he got to be second rate.

66) 33) text: FRANK I guess so.

68) 23) text: FRANK What's the matter?
68) 30) text: FRANK I don't believe you. Did something happen today or what?
68) 33) dialog: What?
68) 34) text: APRIL Oh God, Frank, please don't look so dense. Do you mean you haven't guessed or anything?
68) 35) text: FRANK What are you talking about?
68) 40) dialog: What...?   Jesus.
68) 42) text: APRIL Oh, Frank, I meant to wait until dinner to tell you, but I just - well, I've been pretty sure all week and today I went to the Doctor and now I can't even pretend it's not true.
68) 43) text: FRANK (still stunned) Jesus... How long?
68) 49) text: FRANK You didn't say anything.
68) 53) text: APRIL (CONT'D) I'm sorry, Frank. I'm so sorry.
68) 54) text: FRANK I know you are.

68) 63) dialog: 12 weeks.    So we have time.

69) 2) text: We find Shep, Milly, Frank and April with beach chairs, coolers and umbrellas.
69) 5) text: SHEP So, Frank, how's work?   They gonna survive without you?
69) 6) text: FRANK Actually... Something kinda funny happened the other day. I did some dumb little piece of work to get myself off the hook with Bandy, and suddenly I'm The Bright Young Man.
69) 8) text: FRANK It's incredible. I knocked this thing off in a couple of minutes and now they want me to join their team of `specialist' salesmen.
69) 10) text: FRANK It'd be funny, if they weren't talking about so much damn money.
69) 11) text: April turns and looks at Frank. Long and hard.   If he ca feel her look, he doesn't show it.
69) 17) dialog: (shrugs) Well, it's kind of ironic, don't you think?
69) 18) text: April suddenly stands up.    Frank and Shep watch her wal to the water's edge.
69) 21) text: Frank stares after her.
70) 2) text: Frank comes up beside her.

70) 6) text: FRANK (CONT'D) Look, the point is - we could be happy here. At least for a while.
70) 11) text: FRANK (CONT'D) It is possible that Parisians aren't the only ones who know how to lead interesting lives, April.
70) 15) dialog: No.   Like I said, it's an option.
70) 17) text: FRANK (sharp) Maybe we let that be my business.
70) 19) text: FRANK (exhales) It's too hot for this.    I'm going to get wet.
71) 2) text: Frank sits on the couch.
71) 8) text: FRANK Come on, April.   Of course I do.
71) 10) text: FRANK What the hell do you    mean I don't try? I support you,     don't I? I pay for this house.     I work ten hours a day at a job    I can't stand.
71) 12) text: FRANK Bullshit! I'm not happy about it. But I have the backbone not to run away from my responsibilities!
71) 13) text: APRIL It takes backbone to lead the life you want, Frank.
71) 16) text: FRANK Is it alright with you if I go to the bathroom?
72) 1) text: Frank splashes water on his face like a boxer between rou He looks up at his reflection.
73) 2) text: Frank storms in, a rubber syringe in his hand.

73) 6) text: FRANK You're damn right!
73) 9) text: FRANK Listen. Listen to me. You do this - you do this and I swear to God I'll -

73) 17) text: FRANK That's now April!   Don't I get a say?
73) 18) text: APRIL Of course you do! It would be for you, Frank, don't you see? So you can have time. Like we talked about.
73) 19) text: FRANK How can it be for me if the thought makes my stomach turn over?
73) 20) text: APRIL Then it's for me... Tell me we can have the baby in Paris, Frank. But don't make me stay here. Please.
73) 21) text: FRANK We can't have the baby in Paris.
73) 24) text: APRIL (CONT'D) Frank. Do you actually want another child? Well, do you?
73) 29) text: APRIL (CONT'D) Come on, tell me. Tell me the truth, Frank. Remember that? We used to live by it. You know what's so good about the truth? Everyone knows what it is, however long they've lived without it. No one forgets the truth, Frank, they just get better at lying. So tell me: do you really want another child?
73) 30) text: Frank turns towards her.
73) 31) text: FRANK All I know is what I feel. And anyone else in their right mind would feel the same way.
73) 33) text: FRANK Christ! The fact that you even put it that way! You make it sound like having children is a punishment.
73) 35) text: FRANK And you're sure about that?
73) 37) text: FRANK April, you just said our daughter was mistake. How do I know you didn't try to get rid of her, or Michael for that matter? How do I know you didn't try to flush our entire fucking family down the toilet?
73) 42) text: FRANK But how do I know April?
73) 45) text: FRANK April, a normal woman, a normal sane mother doesn't buy herself a piece of rubber tubing to give herself an abortion so she can, go live out some God damn fantasy.
73) 47) text: FRANK (CONT'D) (sober) All I'm saying is you don't seem entirely rational about this thing... And maybe we should get someone to help you think about it.
73) 49) text: FRANK April if you need a shrink, it'll be paid for. Obviously.
73) 51) text: Frank waits, his heart beating quickly.
73) 58) text: Everything hangs on Frank's answer...
73) 59) text: FRANK I guess maybe it was.
73) 61) text: FRANK (CONT'D) We can be happy here April...   I can make you happy here.
73) 63) text: FRANK (CONT'D) We've had a great few months.   It doesn't have to end...
73) 65) text: FRANK (CONT'D) We're going to be okay.
73) 66) text: APRIL I hope so Frank.   I really hope so.

75) 7) text: We see the scene in dumb-show through the glass door. Bar looks up as Frank enters. An "I knew it all along" smile spreads across Pollock's face. He offers his hand to Fran Frank smiles thinly. They shake.

77) 19) text: FRANK Wanna dance?
77) 24) text: FRANK Think she'll be okay?
77) 29) text: Frank turns his attention to Milly. He's a good dancer. H movements are fast and aggressive, his mind on April.
77) 37) dialog: (sudden remorse) You okay?
78) 1) text: Frank leads the way through the cars.
78) 7) text: A beat.   Frank looks to April.
78) 13) text: FRANK (to April) You'll be alright?
78) 15) text: Frank holds April's look an instant, then walks away with keys in hand.
79) 16) text: APRIL (CONT'D) How pathetic is that? To put all your hopes in a promise that was never made? See, Frank knows...he knows what he wants. He's found his place. He's just fine. Married, two kids. It should be enough. It is for him. He's right; we were never special or destined or anything at all.

83) 18) text: APRIL (CONT'D) Well, I'm sorry Frank, but I don't really feel like talking about it.
83) 20) text: FRANK Okay. What do you feel like talking about?
83) 24) dialog: I don't think I suggested we talk about everything all the time. My point was, we've both been under a strain and we ought to be trying to help each other as much as we can right now.
83) 26) text: FRANK (CONT'D) I mean God knows my own behavior has been pretty weird lately... I mean, as it happens... there is actually something I'd like to tell you about...
83) 29) dialog: I've been with a girl in the city a few times.
83) 34) text: FRANK (CONT'D) A girl I hardly even know. It was nothing to me, but she got a little carried away. She's just a kid... Anyway, it's over now. It's really over. If I weren't sure of that I guess I could never have told you about it.
83) 36) text: FRANK (relieved) Baby, I don't know. I think it was a simple case of wanting to be a man again after all that abortion business. Some kind of neurotic, irrational need to prove something.
83) 41) text: FRANK Why don't you say what you feel?
83) 43) text: FRANK In other words you don't care what I do or who I fuck or anything?
83) 51) text: FRANK Don't you see...Don't you see, I want you to care.
83) 53) text: She goes back into the kitchen. Frank follows her.

84) 47) text: Frank stares at John, his rage increasing.   Mr. Givings to his feet.
84) 55) text: FRANK Now look, I think that's just about enough out of you. I mean, who the hell do you think you are? You come in here and say whatever crazy God damn thing comes into your head and I think it's about time someone told you to keep your God damn -

84) 87) text: FRANK Okay, okay, don't tell me. Don't tell me; let me guess. I made a Disgusting Spectacle of Myself. Right?
84) 91) text: FRANK And everything that man said is True. Right? Isn't that what you're going to say?
84) 94) text: FRANK But you're wrong.
84) 96) text: FRANK Because the man is insane. He's fucking insane! Do you know what the definition of insanity is?
84) 97) text: APRIL What is it, Frank?
84) 98) text: FRANK The inability to relate to another human being. It's the inability to love.
84) 105) text: APRIL (CONT'D) Oh. -- Oh, Frank, you really are a wonderful talker! If black could be made into white by talking, you'd be the man for the job. So now I'm crazy because I don't love you -- right? Is that the point?
84) 106) text: FRANK No. Wrong. You're not crazy and you do love me; that's the point.

84) 122) text: FRANK Oh, no, don't worry, I can't be bothered! You're not worth the trouble it'd take to hit you. You're not worth the powder it'd take to blow you up. You're an empty --
84) 124) text: FRANK (CONT'D) You're an empty, hollow fucking shell of a woman. What the hell are you living in my house for if you hate me so much? Huh? Will you answer me that? Why the hell do you fuck me? What the hell are you carrying my child for?
84) 126) text: FRANK (CONT'D) Why the hell didn't you just get rid of it, when you had the chance? Because listen. Listen: I got news for you. I wish to God you had.
