7) 5) text: APRIL Hi. You about ready to leave? I've just got to get this makeup off, then we can go.

7) 15) text: APRIL Will you do me a favor? Milly and Shep wanted us to go out with them afterwards. Will you say we can't? Say it's because of the baby sitter or something?
7) 17) text: APRIL (tense) Oh. Then would you mind going out again and saying you were mistaken? That should be simple enough.
7) 18) text: FRANK Don't you think that's a little bit rude, April?
7) 19) text: APRIL Well I'll tell them myself.
8) 1) text: April and Frank walk down a long empty echoing corridor, school lockers, booster club posters and silent classroom
9) 1) text: Frank drives. April stares ahead.    Their faces are lit the dashboard. After a while...
9) 7) dialog: Thank you.
9) 11) dialog: All right.
9) 13) text: APRIL Could we sort of stop talking about it now?
9) 15) text: APRIL I said yes. All right, Frank. Could you just stop talking now, before you drive me crazy, please?
9) 17) text: APRIL (CONT'D) What are you doing? Why are we stopping?

11) 8) text: APRIL Why can't you...just... LEAVE ME
12) 1) text: April stands in the dark 30 yards from the road looking o an expansive countryside. There's only a few lights in th distance. This is still farmland.
12) 4) text: APRIL No. Just let me stand here a second.
12) 5) text: Frank raises his arms in exasperation. A car approaches. puts a hand in his pocket and tries to look casual. The car's headlights light up April's back, then pass.
12) 6) text: FRANK April?
12) 9) text: APRIL Haven't I made it clear I don't particularly want to talk about it?
12) 11) text: APRIL How kind of you. How terribly, terribly kind of you.
12) 16) text: APRIL You're always so wonderfully definite, aren't you, on the subject of what you do and don't deserve?
12) 23) text: APRIL Christ, I wish you'd stayed home tonight!
12) 25) text: APRIL And you know what you are? (eyes raking him) You're disgusting.
12) 28) text: APRIL Just because you've got me safely in this little trap, you think you can bully me into feeling whatever you want!
12) 33) text: APRIL Yes, me. (clutching at her chest) Me! Me! Me! Oh, you poor, pathetic little boy В­В­ Look at you! Look at you, and tell me how by any stretch of the imagination you can call yourself a man!
12) 34) text: He raises his fist, she flinches away, and BONG! BONG! BO BONG! He punches the hood of the car. Then, silence. The look April gives him is probably the worst look he's ever received: a look of pitying boredom.
12) 35) text: FRANK Don't look at me like that, April.
12) 36) text: APRIL Could we please go home now?
15) 1) text: April stands at the window.   The SOUND of the car pullin away.

24) 18) dialog: Oh, yes.
29) 1) text: Now we're moving behind April as she moves through the si house. She carries a basket of dirty laundry on her hip. She pulls the bedding off the couch. The distant SOUND of children playing.
29) 5) text: April manages a friendly smile.
29) 7) dialog: Hi Helen.
29) 14) text: APRIL Well, thank you... You want some coffee?
29) 17) text: APRIL Is there something I can do for you, Helen?
29) 19) text: APRIL I'm sorry to hear that.
29) 21) text: April's face.   She knows what it means.

33) 2) text: April is sitting up in bed in the first blue light of day wearing Frank's T-shirt. She holds a curled collection of black and white photographs in her lap. She stops on the same picture of Frank and the Eifel Tower.
33) 5) text: APRIL I've never really been anywhere.
33) 14) text: APRIL Frank Wheeler?
33) 17) text: APRIL I think you're the most interesting person I've ever met.
33) 20) dialog: I mean it.
36) 2) text: April is dressed in a black cocktail dress. She looks wonderful. She smiles. She steps forward and takes his fa in her hands. She kisses him.
36) 7) dialog: Frank...
36) 10) text: APRIL First of all, I missed you all day and I want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the way I've been since that stupid play. I'm sorry for everything and... And I love you... Now wait here till I call you. Okay?
36) 12) text: From inside the house, the sound of the children's voices Whispering, giggling. Then April's voice:
36) 13) text: APRIL (O.S.) (CONT'D) Alright Frank! You can come in now!
37) 3) text: JENNIFER, 7, MICHAEL, 5, and April sit around the table wearing paper birthday crowns.
39) 1) text: Frank steps out of the bathroom. April turns from the mir wearing the silk negligee and comes towards him with two glasses.
39) 2) text: APRIL Frank. I have had the most wonderful idea. I've been thinking about it all day.
39) 4) text: APRIL You know how much money we have saved...?
39) 7) dialog: Enough to live on for six months without you earning another dime. And with the money we could get from the house and the car, longer than that.
39) 10) dialog: ...Paris.
39) 12) text: APRIL (CONT'D) You always said it was the only place you'd ever been that was worth living. So why don't we go there?
39) 18) dialog: Yes.   What's stopping us?
39) 20) text: APRIL You won't be getting any kind of job, because I will.
39) 24) text: APRIL Don't laugh -- listen a minute! Have you any idea what they pay for secretarial positions in the government agencies in Europe? Embassies and those things.
39) 27) text: APRIL I'm serious about this Frank. Do you think I'm kidding or something?
39) 33) text: APRIL Don't you see that's the whole idea? You'll be doing what you should've been allowed to do seven years ago. You'll have time, Frank. You'll have time to find out what it is that you actually want to do, and when you figure it out you'll have the time and the freedom to start doing it.
39) 35) text: APRIL Well, I happen to think this is unrealistic. I think it's unrealistic for a man with a fine mind to go on working like a dog year after year at a job he can't stand, coming home to a place he can't stand, to a wife who's equally unable to stand the same things.
39) 37) text: APRIL (CONT'D) You want to know the worst part? Our whole existence here is based on this great premise that we're somehow very special and superior to the whole thing, and you know what I've realized...? We're not! We're just like everyone else. Look at us!   We've bought into the same ridiculous delusion. This idea that you have to resign from life and settle down the moment you have children. And we've been punishing each other for it.
39) 42) text: APRIL When I first met you, there was nothing in the world you couldn't do or be.
39) 44) text: APRIL You were not! How can you even say that?
39) 46) text: APRIL But Frank, listen to me: It's what you are that's being stifled here. It's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life.
39) 48) text: APRIL Don't you know...?
39) 50) text: APRIL (CONT'D) You're the most valuable and wonderful thing in the world... You're a man.
39) 55) text: APRIL (CONT'D) This is our chance, Frank.   This is our one chance.
39) 60) dialog: Okay?
39) 62) text: April throws her arms around him.
42) 1) text: April sits in the American Express office.
42) 6) dialog: Thank you.

47) 3) text: APRIL ...All the way to... here.
47) 7) text: APRIL Well, sweetheart. It's a big world out there and we thought maybe we should go see a little bit of it.
47) 9) text: APRIL A long way. We have to take a boat ride over the sea to get there.
47) 11) text: APRIL I know. And neither will I. But remember when you started school? And now look how many friends you have...
47) 12) text: Frank senses that they are a little concerned.   April an Frank look to one another.
47) 23) text: APRIL And frog's legs!
47) 24) text: The children dissolve into disgusted laughter.    April a Frank laugh with them.
52) 4) text: Shep wheels around. April and Frank are standing there wi Milly. April wears a new indigo silk dress. Her hair move in the warm breeze. She's never looked better.
53) 6) text: APRIL Oh those look great.    I'm starving!
53) 7) text: April helps herself.
53) 8) text: MILLY April, I can't get over it - you look like the cat who ate the canary! Do you have something to tell us? A little bit of news?
53) 13) text: He smiles conspiratorially at April.
53) 15) text: April smiles back at him.
53) 16) text: APRIL We're going to Europe.    To Paris... To live.
53) 41) dialog: Oh... about a week ago... its hard to remember. We just suddenly decided to go, that's all.
53) 45) dialog: We had to get used to the idea.
53) 54) text: APRIL Frank won't be doing any kind of a job, because I will.
53) 60) text: APRIL You wouldn't believe what they pay for secretarial work in government agencies over there. NATO and E.C.A. and those places.
53) 63) text: APRIL The truth is we just need something different. (MORE)
53) 67) dialog: We're not getting any younger and we don't want life to just pass us by.
55) 1) text: Frank and April burst into the kitchen, laughing.
55) 5) text: Laughing, April hands Frank a drink.
55) 6) text: FRANK (CONT'D) You know what this is like, April? Talking like this? The whole idea of taking off to Europe this way? It's like the way I felt going up to the line the first time, in the war. I was probably just as scared as everyone else, but inside I never felt better. I felt alive. I felt full of blood. (MORE)
55) 10) text: APRIL I felt that way once too.
55) 14) text: APRIL The first time you made love to me.
55) 19) dialog: ...No
58) 4) text: April enters carrying a plate of sandwiches.
58) 6) text: April looks around to be sure everything's in place.
58) 7) text: APRIL Wish I saw his face when you told him you were leaving.
58) 10) text: TOOT of a car horn.   April goes to the window.
58) 11) text: APRIL I think this is them.
60) 1) text: The kitchen is suddenly crowded with the Givings, Frank a April.
60) 4) text: APRIL You're not late.
60) 11) text: APRIL You didn't have to do that.
60) 14) text: APRIL And you must be John?
61) 3) text: APRIL They're at a birthday party.     Sorry they couldn't be here.
61) 6) text: April and Frank exchange a quick glance.
61) 8) text: APRIL It's just some sandwiches.
61) 9) text: April lifts the plate and offers it to John.
61) 10) text: APRIL (CONT'D) John, would you like a sandwich?
61) 20) text: April can't suppress a smile.
61) 25) text: MRS. GIVINGS Oh, this is the most wonderful egg salad, April. You must tell me how you fix it.
61) 37) text: Frank and April exchange a look.
61) 48) text: April's face.   She's not smiling now.
61) 72) text: APRIL We're moving to Paris.
61) 82) text: April looks at Frank - the whole thing is in danger of go off the rails.
62) 1) text: Frank, April and John walk through the woods.
62) 4) text: APRIL I hear you're a mathematician.
62) 7) dialog: All gone?
62) 13) dialog: Yes.   Yes I do.
62) 15) text: He pushes his hat back and turns his head at April.
62) 18) text: There are scars on his forehead.       April can see them
62) 21) dialog: How awful.
62) 23) text: APRIL No. Because the shocks must be awful and... well, because it's awful not to be able to do what it is you want to do. I think mathematics are dull.
62) 24) text: John stares at April.    He smiles.
62) 35) text: APRIL A different way of life.
62) 38) text: John continues walking.   Frank and April watch him go.
63) 1) text: Frank and April at the kitchen table.
63) 2) text: APRIL You know, he's the first person who seemed to know what we were talking about.
63) 5) dialog: If being crazy means living life as if it matters then I don't care if we are completely insane. (beat) Do you?
63) 7) text: APRIL I love you so much.
68) 3) text: April works a sewing machine with a cigarette burning bes her. Jennifer stands beside her holding a stuffed Giraffe and a list, which she reads.

68) 11) text: APRIL I already explained to you, the big things are going to be hard to pack.
68) 14) text: APRIL No! Just the big things. Look. Wouldn't you rather go outside and play with Michael.
68) 16) text: APRIL You've been inside all day.
68) 19) dialog: Well, I don't feel like explaining everything fifteen times to somebody who's too bored and silly to listen!
68) 21) text: April lets out a defeated sigh. She turns to the kitchen see to the supper. Steam rises from the vegetables.
68) 25) dialog: Nothing.
68) 31) text: APRIL Nothing happened today that I haven't known about for days and days.
68) 34) text: APRIL Oh God, Frank, please don't look so dense. Do you mean you haven't guessed or anything?
68) 37) text: APRIL I'm pregnant, that's all.
68) 42) text: APRIL Oh, Frank, I meant to wait until dinner to tell you, but I just - well, I've been pretty sure all week and today I went to the Doctor and now I can't even pretend it's not true.
68) 45) dialog: Ten weeks.
68) 51) dialog: I thought... Oh, I don't know what I thought.
68) 53) text: APRIL (CONT'D) I'm sorry, Frank. I'm so sorry.
68) 56) text: APRIL We don't have to let this stop us. There are things we can do. Remember that girl at school I told you about...? As long as you do it before 12 weeks, it's fine.
68) 58) text: APRIL (CONT'D) We've got to be together in this, Frank. Otherwise nothing's going to make any sense.
68) 65) text: APRIL I love you Frank.
69) 2) text: We find Shep, Milly, Frank and April with beach chairs, coolers and umbrellas.
69) 4) text: April wears a pair of dark glasses, behind which she is thinking, thinking.
69) 11) text: April turns and looks at Frank. Long and hard.   If he ca feel her look, he doesn't show it.
69) 15) text: SHEP (stealing a glance at April) So, you tempted?
69) 18) text: April suddenly stands up.    Frank and Shep watch her wal to the water's edge.
70) 1) text: April stands in the water staring out over the sea. The waves break against her ankles. Whether it occurs to her not, she's staring in the direction of Europe.
70) 3) text: APRIL I thought you turned the job down?
70) 5) text: April shakes her head and drags on her cigarette.
70) 11) text: FRANK (CONT'D) It is possible that Parisians aren't the only ones who know how to lead interesting lives, April.
70) 13) text: APRIL So you've made up your mind?
70) 16) text: APRIL ...And supposing you're right. You make all this money and we have this interesting life here. Won't you still be wasting your life toiling away at a job you find ridiculous? Just like your father.
70) 18) text: APRIL (incredulous) Your business?
71) 1) text: April paces the family room. Her hair is a defiant mess. She still wears her bathing suit under her clothes.

71) 8) text: FRANK Come on, April.   Of course I do.
71) 9) text: APRIL You don't! Because you've never tried at anything. And if you don't try at anything you can't fail.
71) 11) text: APRIL You don't have to!
71) 13) text: APRIL It takes backbone to lead the life you want, Frank.
71) 15) text: APRIL (CONT'D) Where are you going?

73) 7) text: APRIL Go ahead and try!
73) 10) text: APRIL You'll what? You'll leave me?   Is that a threat, or a promise?
73) 12) text: FRANK When did you buy this, April?   I want to know!
73) 16) text: APRIL You know you really are being melodramatic about the whole thing. As long as it's done in the first twelve weeks, it's perfectly safe.
73) 17) text: FRANK That's now April!   Don't I get a say?
73) 18) text: APRIL Of course you do! It would be for you, Frank, don't you see? So you can have time. Like we talked about.
73) 20) text: APRIL Then it's for me... Tell me we can have the baby in Paris, Frank. But don't make me stay here. Please.
73) 22) text: APRIL Why not? I don't need everything we have here. I don't care where we live! I mean who made these rules, anyway? The only reason we moved out here was because I got pregnant. Then we had another child to prove the first one wasn't a mistake. I mean how long does it go on?
73) 24) text: APRIL (CONT'D) Frank. Do you actually want another child? Well, do you?
73) 29) text: APRIL (CONT'D) Come on, tell me. Tell me the truth, Frank. Remember that? We used to live by it. You know what's so good about the truth? Everyone knows what it is, however long they've lived without it. No one forgets the truth, Frank, they just get better at lying. So tell me: do you really want another child?
73) 32) text: APRIL (quiet) But I've had two children.    Doesn't that count in my favor?
73) 34) text: APRIL I love my children.
73) 36) text: APRIL What the hell is that supposed to mean?
73) 37) text: FRANK April, you just said our daughter was mistake. How do I know you didn't try to get rid of her, or Michael for that matter? How do I know you didn't try to flush our entire fucking family down the toilet?
73) 41) text: APRIL No that's not true. Of course I didn't.
73) 42) text: FRANK But how do I know April?
73) 44) dialog: Stop.   Please just stop, Frank.

73) 52) text: APRIL ...Okay. I guess there isn't much more to say, then, is there?
73) 54) text: APRIL (CONT'D) So I guess Paris was a pretty childish idea, huh?
73) 60) text: April closes her eyes. Tears run down her cheeks.   He wa over to her, but he doesn't touch her.
73) 61) text: FRANK (CONT'D) We can be happy here April...   I can make you happy here.
73) 66) text: APRIL I hope so Frank.   I really hope so.
74) 2) text: April approach the children. She squats on the ground so can be at their height and talks to them. Michael tries t get into her arms. Jennifer turns away and walks sulkily across the grass.

77) 20) text: APRIL I don't really feel like it.

77) 23) text: MILLY (CONT'D) (tipsy) Guess April's pretty blue `bout Paris, huh?
77) 29) text: Frank turns his attention to Milly. He's a good dancer. H movements are fast and aggressive, his mind on April.
78) 3) text: April walks alone a few paces behind...
78) 7) text: A beat.   Frank looks to April.
78) 11) text: APRIL Look - why don't you take Milly home, then go home yourself and that would take care of both sitters. Then Shep can take me home later.
78) 13) text: FRANK (to April) You'll be alright?
78) 14) text: APRIL Sure.
78) 15) text: Frank holds April's look an instant, then walks away with keys in hand.

79) 12) text: APRIL I wanted in. I just wanted us to live again.
79) 14) text: APRIL (CONT'D) For years I thought we shared a secret...that we would be wonderful in the world. I didn't exactly know how, but just the possibility...kept me hoping.
79) 16) text: APRIL (CONT'D) How pathetic is that? To put all your hopes in a promise that was never made? See, Frank knows...he knows what he wants. He's found his place. He's just fine. Married, two kids. It should be enough. It is for him. He's right; we were never special or destined or anything at all.
79) 18) text: April doesn't hear, she's pursuing her thought...
79) 20) dialog: I saw a different life. I can't stop seeing it. (beat) Can't leave, can't stay. (beat) No damn use to anyone.
