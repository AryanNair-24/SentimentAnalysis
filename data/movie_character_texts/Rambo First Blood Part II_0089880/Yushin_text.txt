Commander Podovsk has a hard face, sharp features. His bearing is erect, arrogant. He still has Rambo's knife in his hand, which he uses like a painter when he speaks. The other, SGT. YUSHIN, is another story. A tall, broad slab of combat muscle. His hair cut short as a scrub brush. Thick and functional as state sculpture, his features cannot fill his broad, flat face Nordic Mongolian-Circassian heritage... He wears a pine tree patch on his shoulder denoting his status as a "plastune" or cossack scout.

Yushin grabs Rambo's neck and is crushing the life out of him... Rambo manages to drop and twist free and kick Yushin in the face. The pilot sees what is happening. He banks hard, trying to get Rambo to fall out the open door. Rambo stumbles backward, but manages at the last second t grab the barrel of the M-60 doorgun and is suspended out the door. Yushin grabs his pistol and aims as Rambo grabs his boot knife with his free hand and flings it into Yushin's chest... The Russian staggers back then forward and raises his pistol at Rambo. At the last second he collapses and falls forward and past Rambo who manages to pull his knif from the Russian's body as he is falling. The pilot struggles to maintain control and looks terrified as Rambo swings up and advances on him.
