2) 2) dialog: (continuing, to the Prison Guards) That's all... Thanks. The Guards move off. Rambo continues his stare. Trautman, a little uncomfortable, continues.
2) 3) dialog: (continuing) I'm sorry you were sent to sucha hellhole.
2) 5) dialog: You have... haven't you...
2) 7) dialog: Johnny... I told you I'd help you when I could... you interested? Rambo looks off at the distance, watching the Guards hang around off to the side.
2) 8) dialog: (continuing, taken aback) You can't possibly want to stay in prison for another five years?
2) 10) dialog: Hear me out first. A covert operation is being geared up in the Far East. The computer dug out your name as one of the top three able to accomplish the mission.
2) 12) dialog: Recon for P.O.W.'s in Nam.
2) 14) dialog: The prison camp you escaped from in '71 is the target area -- no one knows that terrain better than you. The risk factor is very high. You'll be temporarily reinstated in the forces; and if the operation is successful, there may be a Congressional pardon... are you in, John? Rambo's eyes turn into Trautman's. He nods his acceptance.
2) 15) dialog: (continuing) Good. I'll get the necessary clearances, and the next time we'll meet, it'll be in Thailand with Special OP's designate who will honch the operation. All clear? Trautman shakes Rambo's hand and starts to turn away.
2) 16) dialog: (continuing, pausing) I want you to know I did what I could to keep you out of here. Rambo nods... He believes him...
2) 19) dialog: This time it's up to you. Trautman studies Rambo's calm expression. Trautman nods, leaving Rambo with a sense of miraculous rebirth.

7) 3) dialog: The code name for the insertion and extraction flight team is "Dragonfly"; home base "Wolf Den," your code name if "Lone Wolf." Since you're going solo, you are going to have to rely upon more equipment than you've ever used before, and use it -- so what I'm sayin' is, don't try the "blood and guts" routine, let technology do most of the work. If you need assistance, call for it.
7) 5) dialog: (smiles) . Affirmative. They head out of the canopied area and back toward the Rambo glances over his shoulder at an ultra- modern supersonic jet painted black.

Glances at Rambo who appear oblivious to the Colonel's instructions. Murdock speaks to Trautman but does not think Rambo can overhear him.
7) 20) dialog: Pressure? Let me just say that Rambo's the best combat Vet I've ever seen. A pure fighting machine with only a desire, to win a war someone else lost, and if winning means he has to die, he'll die. No fear. No regrets... one more thing... what you choose to call "Hell", he calls home. Trautman walks away. Murdock shoots Lifer a meaningful glance. Ericson notices this.

17) 1) dialog: Thirty-six hours to get the hell in and out, so don't stop to smell the roses, okay? If there is any trouble, try like hell to get to the Hawk September extraction sight marked on your map. Rambo nods "yes".

143) 0) text: Once again Ericson is flying. He puts the landing skids through the treetops. Trautman sits behind the seats in the main bay. The AIR ROARS in the open door and Lifer, on door gun, dangles his legs in the windstream. The rain forest is a dim blur very close below. Lifer racks the bolt on his M-60 and grins. Trautman nods politely and looks at his watch.
146) 0) text: Trautman watches over Ericson's shoulder as the HELICOPTE ROARS between the walls of the mountain pass. The ship is buffeted by turbulence, bouncing and dropping violently.
153) 1) dialog: That's Rambo! -- Christ, he's found one. Relay the command. Rambo's found one of ours!
156) 3) dialog: He must be crazy! Confirm it!
156) 5) dialog: (grabs a microphone) Murdock, for Christ sake, we have them in sight! Murdock! Do you read?!! We're going down.

162) 1) dialog: What're you doing? Do you know what the hell you've done?!! Murdock stands up quickly, a glass of scotch in his hand.
162) 3) dialog: Don't ever count me with you and your scum. It was a lie, wasn't it? Just like the whole damn war, a lie!
162) 5) dialog: The camp was supposed to be empty. Rambo goes in... a former decorated Vet. He finds no P.O.W.'s. The Congress buys it, case closed. If he gets caught, no one knows he's alive except you and your computers, and you can reprogram that, can't you?
162) 7) dialog: A stinking bureaucrat trying to cover his ass!
162) 9) dialog: And if the pictures showed something they would've been lost, wouldn't they?! Murdock is terribly on edge.
162) 11) dialog: Same as it always is, money. In '72 we were supposed to pay the "Cong" four and a half billion in war reparations, we reneged, and they kept the P.O.W.'s, and now you're doing it all over again!
162) 13) dialog: (roaring) Men! Men who died for their country, you bastard!
162) 15) dialog: You're the one who's making the mistake... Murdock pauses.
