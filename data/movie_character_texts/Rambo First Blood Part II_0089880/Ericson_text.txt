5) 1) dialog: You can take them off. Rambo studies Ericson with a raking glance. The cuffs are removed...
5) 2) dialog: How ya doing, Rambo, I'm Ericson. We better make it over to the hanger. Rambo follows along.
5) 3) dialog: (continuing) So you're the chosen one. You don't remember me do ya? We were in boot camp together in '63. You went Forces, I went Rangers... haven't been stateside since '72.

6) 1) dialog: Pretty soon we'll all be out of a job. Somebody oughta blow it to hell and keep fightin' simple. In the subdued light, banks of video monitors glow, and the status light of upright computer units line one wall.

25) 1) dialog: (filtered) Back in the Badlands, my man. Even the impassive Rambo is affected as he realizes he is back "in country." Lifer holds on to the side of the plane's interior as he moves to his position at the exit door.
25) 3) dialog: Stand by your position -- insertion, minus fifteen seconds. Rambo unbuckles and half-crawls to the open door.

The AIR ROARS in the open door and Lifer, on door gun, dangles his legs in the windstream. The rain forest is a dim blur very close below. Lifer racks the bolt on his M-60 and grins. Trautman nods politely and looks at his watch.
