10) 1) dialog: Don't feel bad about this. I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt...I should probably lie down for a minute, rest my eyes. Please know, when I drift off, it will be like every day lately. I’m fine, totally fine. I’m going to dream about you. It’s always you. Tony switches the helmet off.

13) 23) dialog: I said we'd lose, you said we'd “do that together, too.” Guess what, Cap, we lost, and you weren’t there. But that’s what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We’re the “Avengers”, not the “Pre-vengers-”"
13) 25) dialog: I’ve got nothing for ya, Cap. No coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero, zip, nada. No trust. (rips out RT) Here. You take this. You find him, you put this on, and hide. (drops to his knees) I’m fine! Tony COLLAPSES. Rhodey catches him.

36) 16) dialog: Gotta say it. Sometimes I’ve missed that giddy optimism. Sadly, all your high hopes won’t help me if there’s no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said “time heist.” I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise.
36) 18) dialog: Stop, Scott. Stop. Are you telling me that your plan to save the universe is more than loosely based on Back to the Future?
36) 20) dialog: Good. Because that would be horseshit. Scientifically speaking, your brother's picture doesn’t disappear just ‘cause you went to the dance with your mom. That’s not how quantum physics works.
36) 22) dialog: We did stand. And yet here we are.
36) 26) dialog: Fine.
36) 28) dialog: No, Scott. I won’t. Even. Suddenly, MORGAN walks onto the porch.
36) 30) dialog: Good job. I’m saved. (to Steve) I wish you were coming here to ask me something else. I’m honestly happy to see you. If you want to stay- Steve tries one last time.
36) 32) dialog: Yeah, well, I got my second chance right here. I can’t roll the dice on it. The table is set for six. If you don’t talk shop, you’re welcome to stay for lunch. He exits. 29
