29) 2) dialog: Hey. Kid. What happened here? The kid says nothing. He just stares at Scott with a haun look. Then he stands on his pedal and keeps riding. CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK. ..

33) 3) dialog: Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics?
33) 5) dialog: Well, five years ago, just before this Thanos guy...I went into a place called the Quantum Realm. It’s like its own microscopic universe. You can only get there if you're incredibly small. Hope, she’s my...she was supposed to pull me out. But then Thanos happened. And I was stuck in there.
33) 7) dialog: (getting excited) Okay, but that’s the thing. It wasn’t. For me, it was only five hours. The rules in the Quantum Realm aren’t like out here. They're completely unpredictable. Is anybody gonna eat that sandwich?
33) 9) dialog: Time works differently in the Quantum Realm. Steve and Natasha share a look.
33) 10) dialog: Problem is, right now, it’s chaos, there’s no way to navigate it. But what if we could figure out a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time...and come out in another. Like, before Thanos—
33) 12) dialog: No, not a machine. More like a... (searches, then gives up) Yeah, like a time machine. I know it sounds crazy...

36) 7) dialog: I did.
36) 9) dialog: A time heist.
36) 11) dialog: Still Scott...
36) 17) dialog: Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. No talking to our past selves. No betting on sporting events-
36) 19) dialog: (meaning “yes”) No...
36) 23) dialog: Look, Stark- Can I call you Tony?
36) 25) dialog: Tony-
36) 27) dialog: I get that you’ve got a lot on the line, here. You’ve got a wife. A daughter. But I lost someone very important - a lot of us did - and now we have a chance to save her, and everyone else, and you won’t even-
37) 3) dialog: What are we gonna do? We need him. You want to stop?

43) 3) dialog: You're sure these modifications are safe? He looks over to...SMART HULK, WEARING READING GLASSES, MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO A NEW CONTROL PANEL.
43) 5) dialog: Because the guy who invented this thing is pretty much a genius-

45) 4) dialog: Oh, my God!
52) 2) dialog: Easy, easy. Careful with those.
52) 4) dialog: You're being very Hulky- Scott takes the tubes from him and inserts them, himself.
52) 5) dialog: These are Pym Particles. You can’t shrink to the Quantum Realm without them, and since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, we can’t make any more. I told you. We’ve only got enough for one round trip each, no do-overs. Scott gently clicks the tubes into their housing.
52) 6) dialog: Plus two test runs— SUDDENLY, SCOTT SHRINKS INTO NOTHING, THEN GROWS BACK. He takes that in... 49
52) 7) dialog: One test run. (embarrassed) Okay, maybe I’m not ready.
52) 14) dialog: Sure, we can. We take the stones before Thanos gets them, then he doesn’t have them. Problem solved.
52) 27) dialog: Apparently, Back to the Future is bullshit.
57) 5) dialog: I haven't. (off their looks) Just...saying.

78) 2) dialog: Who are these guys?
78) 4) dialog: Seriously? ‘Cause it’s kind of obvious they’re bad guys.
78) 8) dialog: All right. Flick me. Tony flicks Scott with a finger, sending him sailing into ATTACHE CASE. TONY leaps out the window, Bleeding Edge armor forming ar him as he falls. Al Tony joins the others in the elevator. Then... Al HULK steps up to THE ALREADY CROWDED ELEVATOR. Avenger smile awkwardly. There’s no room. Al HULK (angrily) Hulk take stairs.
83) 2) dialog: Bombs away. SCOTT DROPS BENEATH TONY’S BLACK SABBATH SHIRT. INT. TONY STARK’S SHIRT - CONTINUOUS (AVENGERS 1) SCOTT slides down Tony’s clavicle to the RT. He sniffs.
83) 3) dialog: Is that...Axe body spray?
83) 5) dialog: I’m going inside you...NOW. SCOTT SQUEEZES BETWEEN Al TONY’S SKIN AND THE RT.
84) 7) dialog: This place is a mess. (finding a wire) You promise you won’t die?
84) 9) dialog: That doesn’t actually sound minor- Tony sees PIERCE reaching for Al TONY'S CASE.
84) 11) dialog: Here goes... SCOTT YANKS THE WIRE OUT OF ITS SOCKET. IN THE LOBBY, Al TONY GRIPS HIS CHEST.
84) 19) dialog: That wasn’t supposed to happen, was it? Al THOR LOOKS UP, REALIZING... Al THOR WHERE’S LOKI? SHIELD TEAMS FAN OUT, ON ALERT.
97) 5) dialog: You said we only had one shot. This was our shot. We shot it. It was six stones or nothing! Six stones—
97) 7) dialog: You ruined the Time Heist!
97) 11) dialog: Whoa, whoa. We don’t have any other options. We can’t go to any other times. No do-overs! We've only got one particle left, each. Use it now, that’s it, bye-bye, we don’t come home.

97) 20) dialog: Wait! What are you improvising? STEVE HANDS SCOTT THE STAFF.
97) 23) dialog: Steve- Cap- Captain America, if you do this and he’s wrong...you’re not coming back. Steve and Tony let the weight of that sink in. dHe’s righ Even so, Tony turns to Steve.

138) 30) dialog: Top floor, everybody out!
138) 56) dialog: Hold on! (shrinking to normal size) That wasn’t our only time machine. He clicks the KEYS TO LUIS’ VAN. From a distance, we hear “LA CUCARACHA.” Steve immediately gets it.
