14) 0) text: We HEAR the strains of the theme of a past hit movie comi from Cathy's cassette player. A rack of soundtracks clear visible. Cathy is frowning as she reads the last of the g pages. She overhears some conversation in the adjoining r which begins to disturb her concentration.
14) 2) text: Cathy closes the door, shutting her off. She now begins t fill out a form with a felt-tipped pen. As she does so, t pad is supered on the screen--action seen through it. As writes, we see the notations on the super. It is marked COVERAGE--CONFIDENTIAL FROM: CATHY BRESLOW. BURKE ADLER.

14) 8) dialog: (into phone) Hi. I just finished. I'll have my  coverage right over. It's past  derivative... it's photocopying.  What a hoot! You're kidding, right?  There is truly active bidding for  this book? Really? 2.3 million? Okay,  see you.

15) 5) dialog: Well, you know, it's a little  garbagey.
15) 8) dialog: (stung) Hey. It's not like I didn't recommend  it.
15) 10) dialog: How'd it go?

30) 0) text: Cathy and Matt are leaning against Burke's car. Cathy is  distraught--temporarily, but horribly, unsure of herself. Matt is looking at her. If he had a little more confidenc going for him right now, he would make his move. But, for now, they are two self-doubters on different trips.
30) 1) dialog: I never thought it would do this  well. There were so many holes; I  told everybody it wasn't going to do  business. Why am I so public with my  opinions?
30) 3) dialog: Not with that score. You know, maybe  tonight's the night I'm losing my  entire mind, but weren't you in  'Platoon?'
30) 5) dialog: But there was that one long close up-- where you seemed ashamed of yourself  but still arrogant.

48) 2) dialog: (nervously taking the  plunge) To be honest, I had problems with  'Ground Zero.' But this 'People Get  Hurt' one, while it might not be my  exact, exact thing, I think will  really work for an audience. It's so  over the top, you have a great time.
48) 4) dialog: Yes.
49) 22) text: Cathy has joined them.
49) 23) dialog: Burke's going crazy waiting for the  score.
49) 25) dialog: (to Matt) How are you, anyway?

The whole "D" staff is there, including Cathy, having lunch, along with Claire, the casting assistant. I the b.g., we see Matt, huddled, sitting on the roof's awf green outdoor carpeting, feeling much the same as Jeannie the previous scene.
53) 10) dialog: What's wrong? What happened?
53) 33) text: Cathy rises and begins to exit.
53) 35) dialog: If you didn't, you sure should have.

54) 9) dialog: I just got this feeling of seeing  myself talking to you and how this  is the most important moment of...  ever.
54) 11) dialog: I've been watching this company make  movies that cost tens of millions of  dollars and all the while I've known  about this wonderful script which we  can somehow own and we could make  for about $14,000,000... $3,000,000  if you can live without stars or a  name director.
54) 13) dialog: I've sent you coverage on it nine  times. I swear to you, Burke, it  will work. You've never heard me say  that.
54) 15) dialog: (an unexpectedly fierce  outburst) I don't know anything about action- adventure!! (on his look, she  gains control) I have no idea where that came from.  Hey, I know everyone thinks I don't  have any commercial sense because of  what I said at the 'Gremlins' preview  and all... And you think I can't put  myself on the line. Well, if this  picture doesn't work, fire me. Have  me killed if it doesn't get good  reviews. If this doesn't get a 70  percent definite recommend from women  49 and under, I promise to be your  sex slave until they drop ticket  prices back to five bucks and start  enforcing the R rating.
54) 17) dialog: You've got to do this. I think this  movie can save me.
54) 19) dialog: 'Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.'
56) 13) text: His mood has changed. It's a fine sign that Cathy has cal him at home. He needs only for his child to take pity and listen to him.
57) 0) text: As Cathy drives past some rough examples of street life, finally finds Matt's building with its grim iron gate sec system. Cathy, uncomfortable in these surroundings, parks her car, brushes her hair, while, at the same time, putti in place a phony cheap-car-radio-sticker over her own  expensive system, and gets out.
58) 2) dialog: Yes.
58) 4) text: In the b.g. WE HEAR Jeannie loudly imploring her father t make the person wait till she's finished dressing. There the SOUND OF the buzzer. Cathy hurls herself at the door good four times before finally timing it right and gather the necessary strength to spill through.

59) 10) dialog: Are you going to a party?
59) 16) text: She starts for the door, doubles back, and kisses a surpr Cathy full on the lips... The gesture is beautifully, eve movingly carried off. It is totally false.
59) 18) dialog: (totally thrown) Well,... thank you.
59) 22) text: Favoring Cathy, Matt leans out the doorway until Jeannie safely next door, then re-enters.
59) 23) dialog: What a little winner, huh?
59) 25) dialog: (waving script) This is my favorite project. And it  looks like we're going ahead with  it.
59) 27) dialog: Well, come on, what's original? And  this is a wonderful rewrite. It's  funnier.
59) 29) dialog: Yes... Burke says I can test whoever  I want. He wasn't even surprised  when I mentioned you. So, if you  could read this rewrite now and if  you like it, we can make a test  deal... (catching herself) they can make a test deal... we can  tell them that they can make a test  deal. (in explanation) I think it's important for me to  steer clear of the business end.
59) 31) dialog: Longfellow Deeds.
59) 33) dialog: Who goes to town, yes.
59) 36) dialog: Stop being so creepy honest. I really  have an instinct about you for this.  I'm going home--call me when you  finish reading it. (how quickly status  changes things) Or... come on over.
62) 0) text: White walls, thick rugs, great, great, fantasy garret; sp but cozy. He walks a step, then there is a girlish squeal and a naked Cathy streaks the rest of the way to her bedr from the bathroom.
62) 1) dialog: (calling) I mistimed it. (sticking her head  out the door) I wanted you to catch me fully  frontal.
62) 3) dialog: So you loved it. A lot? A little?
62) 7) dialog: (pointedly) Do you see why I think you're right?
62) 9) dialog: (lower) You know this is really happening,  so I wish you wouldn't kid around  about it.
62) 11) text: Cathy peeks down her bathrobe. Then broadly.
62) 12) dialog: There are some mixed signals coming  out of here, aren't there? (phone rings; she  answers) Hi. Working... I can't write down a  number now. Call me back. (to Matt) The script?
62) 14) dialog: I want to hear everything. You want  to go page by page?
62) 16) dialog: (hurt) Okay.
62) 18) dialog: Please. I understand.
62) 21) dialog: (a smile) What do you mean?
63) 2) dialog: (as he enters her) I'll tell you the truth, Matt. I've  never felt more like turning my phone  off.
63) 5) dialog: I don't understand what you're worried  about.
63) 7) dialog: But I get a lot of calls.
63) 9) dialog: I could put the machine on 'monitor,'  but it's going to be... I don't know.
63) 11) dialog: Okay.
63) 14) dialog: You look so serious.
63) 22) text: Cathy, in the throes of sexual union, feeling a bit divid by the offer on the phone... she shakes it off.
63) 24) dialog: Please, we're making love here.
63) 32) dialog: It's all right.
66) 0) text: Matt is in the final process of being made up, going over his lines. Cathy enters.
66) 1) dialog: Jeannie's fine. There's a whole bunch  of kids in the building. She's  fascinated. And they're all ready  for you.
66) 3) dialog: You're the only one.
66) 8) dialog: Sure. (she hugs Matt) Good luck, Matt. (whispered advice) The thing they're looking for most  is sexy.
66) 9) text: And then they're gone. With that bit of advice, Matt is  totally fucked up. A beat after Cathy leaves:
67) 0) text: As crowded as it was for the previous audition scene, but this time they are reading children of varied ages, and t kids and their parents are all over the stairs, etc. Jean is filled with wonder and is arrestingly and atypically s as she makes her way through this world of the young, cli to Cathy's hand, as the kids sing their version of "MAKE  BELIEVE"--the stage parents taking one verse.

68) 11) dialog: Wait till you hear this one.

71) 0) text: As Matt and Cathy come into frame... Matt forcefully plac her with her back to the wall. She is not one to be pushe around.
71) 1) dialog: Don't!
71) 3) dialog: I'm trying to hang in here but  everything in me cuts off when  somebody acts this way.
71) 5) dialog: I didn't... She went for water and  by the time she got back, they had  offered her the part. Blame Burke,  he was there...
71) 8) dialog: The white kid in a multi-racial foster  home with all these kids of varying  ages. It's not a bad show. I sure  can't wait to see the test.
71) 10) dialog: No. They offered it to her off the  reading. I meant your test.
71) 12) text: Cathy has nothing to offer. Matt begins leading her back. HOLD ON THEIR BACKS and see the chink in Matt's confidenc hear the tightness in his voice as he asks:

74) 17) dialog: (wearily) Everything doesn't boil down to...
74) 23) dialog: No...
74) 25) text: They file out. Cathy gets up several beats later than the others... and follows them out, avoiding Nan's look.
75) 1) dialog: (into phone) Hello. Matt... Hi... Okay, sure...
75) 3) dialog: (again) Matt... (louder) Matt... Matt... Maybe it would be  easier if I just said 'hi' to her...  Hi, Jeannie... Yes, it's exciting...  No, no. He's right, honey, they get  somebody to read it to you. Now, put  your dad on--it's important. No,  first put your dad on... DAMN IT! (she waits a beat) ...Matt. Uh-huh, a few hours ago...  They all... everyone liked your work,  but I think they'll go for a name or  something.
75) 4) text: She listens to him. He is hurt. Cathy, though, is also  wrestling with her own internal struggles. She has betray him and is ashamed; in a strange way--terrified. She is,  therefore, just a little irritable.

80) 13) text: She breaks free, depriving Matt of the sweet and simple m he wanted with her. She's one of the first ones on the se other kids still hugging their parents.

80) 21) dialog: I'm glad I found you.
80) 24) dialog: You holding up? What did you do last  night after I called?
80) 26) dialog: Okay. Okay. So you don't want to  tell me. Be a tough guy.
80) 28) dialog: I feel relieved just seeing you after  all that stuff... whew... Okay. (preparing to go) Burke wants to...
80) 30) text: Cathy is as simple and direct as she is embarrassed.
80) 31) dialog: Yes.
80) 33) dialog: Yes.
80) 35) dialog: Eventually.
80) 37) dialog: This is the thing that makes me  nervous about you... You keep on  assuming I'm nicer than I am.
82) 4) dialog: Jeannie... I can't talk now because...
82) 6) dialog: Tell him I can't talk 'cause I'm on  the phone with a director...
82) 8) dialog: (sharply) I can't. I have to hang up.
83) 0) text: Jeannie, truly stung by the hang-up. She takes this act o Cathy's as an insult to herself and her father. Matt does feel too wonderful about it himself.
89) 0) text: Cathy is in mid conversation with Millie. Matt enters and boldly says his piece.
89) 2) dialog: You know, I could get away now. But  I've got a big meeting later. We'd  better take two cars.

89) 4) dialog: See you later. Thanks again.
90) 0) text: Cathy's car followed by Matt in Burke's car. The frame ho both cars close as if this were one long car.
92) 6) dialog: She takes a breath and then plunges.
93) 4) dialog: (hyper) I don't know whether I'm being a  coward for telling you this way or  brave for telling you period... Can  you hear me?
93) 6) dialog: But I better talk fast because this  is where my phone always kicks out...  When we did your screentest... Can  you hear me?
93) 8) dialog: Well, I sort of folded on you at the  end.
93) 10) dialog: Matt?
93) 12) dialog: I did. Truly. But the discussion got  sort of dumb. It was a question of  sexiness.
93) 14) dialog: Well, sort of, yes.
93) 16) dialog: Well, I'll tell you. I certainly  must think so pretty much because I  feel great about where we're going  now...
94) 0) text: There is a longish line of cars behind Matt and Cathy.

95) 4) text: Cathy going out of sight.
104) 0) text: MUSIC, a tension-filled version of "Poor Bastard." Burke' stride was never stronger, his posture never worse; head  hunched down into his neck. Suddenly, he reacts as he see the staff of Popcorn Pictures grouped together backstage. Cathy walking towards the group hurriedly from one direct as Burke approaches from the other. Seeing his staff has  clearly moved Burke.
104) 2) text: He starts off, but a jubilant Cathy stops him, whispers  something. He reacts with excitement.
104) 3) dialog: She sees Matt deep in the wings watching the stage. She c to him with some urgency.
104) 4) dialog: Matt. Matt. Matt.
104) 7) dialog: I'll talk fast. It's amazing news.  Oliver Stone's been looking for a  comedy and...
104) 9) dialog: (her voice breaking) ...he's doing my picture.
104) 12) dialog: Part of this involves you. He  remembers you from 'Platoon' and  wants to use you in this one. (he stops) Got your attention, huh?
104) 19) dialog: I'm sorry.
104) 21) dialog: (broadly) I guess it's because I'm just  incredibly insensitive to all human  needs. I'd ask you to save me, but  I'm so far gone, I wouldn't want you  to waste your time.
104) 23) text: She reacts, but he walks off, not wanting to get into it. Cathy, however, has had a tricky nerve struck. She contin biting off each word.
104) 24) dialog: You know, I don't have a kid or a  mate or a talent. (holding up book bag) I got this. (she's quite upset) And shoot me if I think it's  important.
104) 25) text: Cathy, who looks alone and adorable as we HEAR MUSIC of " LONELY LIFE OF MINE." He puts a comforting hand on her. S speaks nakedly from deep within herself; her eyes downcas
104) 26) dialog: You think I'm a superficial jerk. (and then a whispered  afterthought) You can't be right.
104) 28) dialog: (broadly) Oh, great.
104) 29) text: And now she raises her eyes--big, blue and vulnerable. If this look were returned, "I love yous" could flow--they c sink to the floor in a joint epiphany; but there is no ro or kindling in Matt's eyes. He is in a hurry. Pridefully, Cathy turns and walks off in the opposite direction, her  flight so instinctive, she forgets her book bag. We hold this--her exit, then:
