They really reach  right into her stomach and pull out  this baby. It's not just a rumor.  God. I understand the expression  'mind blowing' for the first time.  It means something so wonderful  happens that the top of your head  comes off and your brain pops out.  Part of it was terrifying, the baby  was turned and they couldn't budge  her.

61) 0) text: Matt, holding the script, walks the small lane through th tidy lawn to the perfect Silver Lake cottage. We HEAR MUS from inside. (A soundtrack.) There is a note on the door, which is slightly ajar, reading: "Come right in if you lo it--ring if you have reservations." Matt enters.
62) 4) dialog: Give me a second--all of a sudden,  there's a lot to deal with.
62) 6) dialog: (again) It's terrific.
62) 8) dialog: Because you're nice and you know I  need work.
62) 10) dialog: Sorry, but I think the audition rule  is that I have to be serious unless  the person in charge is wearing a  bathrobe and her nipples are sticking  out... (holds fingers apart) ...this much.
62) 13) dialog: It's really good. I get a little  nervous thinking about the  opportunity.
62) 15) dialog: If it's okay. I kind of work on these  things in a private... it's just...  it's a little better for me if I  don't...
62) 17) dialog: Okay, let's do it. It won't kill me.
62) 20) dialog: I swear to God, I don't know which  thing I want more, the sex or the  conversation afterwards.
63) 0) text: As they enter and move to the bed where Matt starts  undressing.
63) 1) dialog: I mean I haven't been to bed with  anyone since Jeannie got here... I  haven't talked to anyone the way I  need to. (cradling her breast) I haven't seen anything this  beautiful. I haven't felt this good  about life. I mean, I've been lonely,  Cathy.
63) 4) dialog: You can't shut the phone off. I left  this number with Jeannie's sitter.
63) 6) dialog: I'm not worried. But if the phone  was off, I would worry.
63) 8) dialog: Oh.
63) 10) dialog: It will be okay. I think the most  important thing is to stop talking  about the phone. Turn it off, monitor,  whatever.
63) 15) dialog: I am so serious.
63) 16) text: Matt totally there... this is major for him, then he does something sensitive... reads her concern over the depth o his need and interest and shrugs, indicating he can't hel it.
63) 23) dialog: Is this the kind of crap you listen  to all day?
63) 30) text: The sound of a hangup... As Matt springs from the bed.
63) 31) dialog: I'm sorry...
63) 33) dialog: (as he leaves) Is there a name for what we just  had?
64) 0) text: Matt driving. Burke in back as his anxieties gnaw away.
64) 1) dialog: This is awkward, my driving you around  and testing for you tomorrow.
64) 3) dialog: Well, I hope you understand I can't  drive you to work tomorrow and then  go in and test. It's just...
64) 6) dialog: Thanks. And, look, if I get the lead  in this movie, you'll have to go  back to sitting up front with me.
65) 0) text: Matt, wildly dialing a phone--orange juice in hand, Jeann standing nearby. He shrieks one phrase.
65) 1) dialog: (into phone) No sitter!!! Thanks. We're leaving  now.
66) 0) text: Matt is in the final process of being made up, going over his lines. Cathy enters.
66) 2) dialog: How many men are they testing today?
66) 4) text: Matt is surprised... But he is a pro and so immediately m use of this sudden blip in status.
66) 5) dialog: Then tell them I need a little more  time.
66) 7) dialog: I mean for me. I want to focus a  little.
66) 9) text: And then they're gone. With that bit of advice, Matt is  totally fucked up. A beat after Cathy leaves:
66) 12) dialog: (quickly) Hey!
66) 14) dialog: (again) You guys have to leave. This is  important and I need to be alone  right now...
66) 15) text: They exit... Matt thumbs through the script... does a  relaxation exercise... takes a breath and thinks... a bea and he is reasonably confident... he walks one half-circl of the room making sure he's fully pumped, then exits.
68) 0) text: Matt making his way past the last of the kid stragglers.  Cathy and Jeannie come running up to him.
68) 1) dialog: It felt great... Everybody...
68) 7) dialog: Anyway, the girl I did it with, by  the way, she's really good; the  director, the crew... they all thought  we nailed it.
68) 10) text: Cathy nods and Jeannie begins to push Matt into Cathy's o for privacy.
69) 8) dialog: You wait here, Jeannie.
70) 0) text: Several people milling about... Matt eyes Cathy. We still hear Jeannie's muffled singing from the other side of the door.
70) 1) dialog: (furious) I have to talk to you.
71) 0) text: As Matt and Cathy come into frame... Matt forcefully plac her with her back to the wall. She is not one to be pushe around.
71) 2) dialog: What in hell is wrong with you? You  actually think...
71) 4) dialog: (continuing right  along) ...that you can have my kid audition  for a show without asking me.
71) 6) text: Matt takes this in. Just a millimeter underneath his fury professional curiosity.
71) 7) dialog: What's the part, anyway?
71) 9) dialog: How were they able to test her so  fast?
71) 11) dialog: Oh... A child actor. Just what any  kid with problems needs to straighten  out--a series of her own...
71) 12) text: Cathy has nothing to offer. Matt begins leading her back. HOLD ON THEIR BACKS and see the chink in Matt's confidenc hear the tightness in his voice as he asks:
71) 13) dialog: You'll let me know as soon as they  see my test?
72) 2) dialog: Not if I don't let you. That's the  law, the police law.
72) 5) dialog: (with a real edge) You're going to have to learn to  look at me and listen to me and the  longer I have to wait THE ANGRIER  I'M GOING TO BE.
72) 7) dialog: Me too. Just listen.
72) 9) dialog: Because I know about this. I have  worked with kid actors... They don't  have that much fun. They're inside  all day... they don't get to go to  regular schools or play with their  regular friends like Ricky and Essa. (progressively losing  it) And their parents? You think I'm  going to be one of those parents,  sitting in one of those rooms, where  we all go crazy trying to jump start  our egos with our kids' sweat, all  the time smiling at each other like  our lives are working while we root  against everyone else's little girl? (Jeannie is totally  confused, until) No!! No way! I can't!
72) 12) dialog: Pick it up, Jeannie.
72) 13) text: She's so down, she complies--picking it up and walking it the trash can. Matt stops her and takes the script.
72) 14) dialog: Let's work on it.
73) 0) text: The staff of Popcorn Pictures is gathered in the boss' of watching Matt's screentest on projection TV. Burke sits n to Nan on a sofa--Cathy sits in front of him--others in c or on the floor. One ASSISTANT is attempting to "fine tun the color--the TINT BAR GRAPH is on screen sliding betwee and - as the color changes. Burke talks sotto to Nan.
73) 13) dialog: What's wrong?
73) 15) dialog: Well, in that case, your dog died.
73) 16) text: There is laughter in the room. The actress smiles through her tears--pats Matt for being wonderful.
73) 18) dialog: I can't remember. You're too pretty. (on her look) Oh, I told them I'd keep on being  Chairman. (then explaining) I'm Chairman, you know.
73) 20) dialog: Told them I'd keep on being Chairman  if they hired everybody back.
73) 22) dialog: Oh, that I was crazy. You always  wear your hair back like that?
73) 23) text: She kisses him. We HEAR the director say, "Cut. Terrific, guys." The girl and Matt hug, no longer in character, as  others come in to congratulate them.
76) 5) text: Matt opens the door quickly.
76) 6) dialog: Everything's okay... I'm sorry I  forgot to put you back on with Cathy.
76) 9) text: Matt sits down, still suffering a bit of dysfunction, una to keep up appearances other than a few minor half-hearte tweaks at his daughter who stands solemn and silent at hi side. She pets him some... this goes on for several beats the STRAINS OF "YOU COULD BE WONDERFUL" accompany the mom Then:
76) 11) text: With some effort, Matt lifts his head and nods permission
76) 13) text: Matt nods, rises and leads her into the small kitchen.
78) 0) text: Matt is driving. Burke is seated alongside him, talking  without looking at him.
78) 2) dialog: I don't think you have to worry about  that.
78) 6) dialog: Hi.
78) 8) text: She laughs delightedly. Burke leans across Matt's lap to closer to the microphone.
79) 1) dialog: Are you going to need me? The kids  are rehearsing and I'd like to take  a look.
79) 3) dialog: (amazed) Is that true?
80) 2) dialog: I bet I know what it looks like to  you.
80) 4) dialog: A giant "find Waldo."
80) 9) dialog: That pretend living room, right over  there.
80) 11) dialog: (holding her arm) Wait a second, Jeannie. Let Daddy  give you a few tips here.
80) 13) text: She breaks free, depriving Matt of the sweet and simple m he wanted with her. She's one of the first ones on the se other kids still hugging their parents. As Cathy comes up behind Matt, we can HEAR Jeannie who, having so small a t for her father, needs to confirm what he just told her.
80) 15) text: Matt reacts.
80) 19) text: Matt looks him off fiercely. The Passing Voice addresses friendlier parents.
80) 22) dialog: Hi.
80) 25) dialog: (as if teasing) What do you think I did? I cried  like a baby.
80) 27) dialog: Now you got it.
80) 29) dialog: You ever go out with him?
80) 32) dialog: You slept with him?
80) 34) dialog: Did you hate it?
80) 36) dialog: (reeling a bit) Good Lord.
80) 45) text: The Director beckons Matt to lead her away. He does.
80) 47) dialog: Not with that attitude.
80) 49) dialog: (again) It's just that they... Well, did  they tell you what an audience is?
80) 51) dialog: Good. Now, because there's an  audience, they want you to know all  the words you have to say really  well. And since you can't read yet... (off her fierce look) ...you're going to have to be patient  and try hard. I can help you.
80) 54) dialog: Yes. (on her broad disbelief) I can. I can help make it okay. Trust  me.
81) 0) text: Matt on phone, Jeannie standing next to him reaching for phone.
81) 1) dialog: (to Jeannie) Not yet. Don't grab. (into phone) Thank you. We really appreciate this.  Hi, Beth. I...
81) 4) text: Jeannie sits herself by the window, protected by an iron  grill, and sits listening to her mother. There is about t pose something prescient; unmistakably, Jeannie will look this way again as a young woman cloaked in the love of so guy... but for now it's her mother, her crazy mother, who blots out dread. Matt is struck by how quiet and adoring  Jeannie looks even as he moves to give his daughter some  privacy. Several beats, Jeannie noticing her Dad looking her--switching positions, body language indicating that s wants to put him out of her mind... then a thought.
81) 6) dialog: Jeannie, your mom's not going to  understand what you mean.
81) 9) text: She hangs up. Matt pissed.
81) 10) dialog: Why don't you let me be on your side  for a second?
81) 12) dialog: Do you know what trust means?
81) 14) dialog: It means that even if something is  hard to believe, you believe someone  you trust because you know he wouldn't  say it unless it were true.
81) 16) dialog: Yeah, I think you get the concept.
81) 18) dialog: I think you do.
81) 20) dialog: Just know that...
81) 22) dialog: (giving up) You want to help me make a phone  call?
81) 24) dialog: Seven... two...
81) 26) dialog: Cathy. She's very nice. One... six...
83) 0) text: Jeannie, truly stung by the hang-up. She takes this act o Cathy's as an insult to herself and her father. Matt does feel too wonderful about it himself.
83) 1) dialog: You have to understand that sometimes  people are too busy.
86) 2) text: Matt laughs. Jeannie looks at him shyly... he looks at he with encouragement. Suddenly she is in his arms, hugging hard, an emotional dam seems to have broken.
86) 4) text: Matt holds on--clearly, deeply moved. Then he exercises t effort to control his emotions and speaks, surprisingly, a Black woman.
86) 5) dialog: (as Black woman) I hope that makes you feel a whole  lot better, Chile... 'Cause it sure  goes a long way to cure what ails  me.
86) 7) dialog: (as himself, coaching) ...got in this much...
86) 9) dialog: Right. Over a...
86) 11) dialog: Yes. 'I can't believe I got in this  much trouble over a word.' Now do  you know what she means when she  says that?
86) 13) dialog: No.
86) 15) dialog: It's your choice... But I'm not  helping unless you try to understand  as well as memorize. It will be fun.  Come on. I know it's hard...
86) 17) dialog: Anything to shut me up, huh? Okay,  this little girl you're pretending  to be... she can't be with her Mommy  either, just like you, or her  father... she has to stay in Rainbow  House which is called that because... (Jeannie starts  fidgeting) Jeannie... (she stops) ...because everyone's a different  color... so when this little girl  calls the black lady who takes care  of all the children this terrible  word... it's like the worst thing  anybody can do... Come here.
86) 19) dialog: Yeah, I might have been working you  too hard on that one.
86) 22) dialog: (ignoring her) Now, did the director tell you how  he wanted you to do it?
86) 24) dialog: Faster?
86) 26) dialog: Okay. We don't always get good  directors, so it's important for  us...
86) 28) dialog: I'm referring to the family of actors,  you little shithead.
87) 0) text: Matt and Jeannie walking from the catering truck. They ar eating ravenously. MUSIC CONTINUES... VERY JOYOUS.
87) 2) dialog: It's a breakfast burrito. It's what  actors eat when they're working.
88) 1) dialog: Now, let's work a little more. The  most important acting you do is when  you listen. You're worried about  being able to cry when you're supposed  to, right?
88) 3) dialog: Well, there are really only two ways  to do it. Think of something that  makes you really sad... or forget  you're you and really forget you're  pretending...
88) 5) text: Matt reads from script.
88) 6) dialog: (as a furious Black  woman) 'Don't test me, child! I could eat  you for lunch when I was your age  and I'm a hell of a lot bigger now!'
88) 8) dialog: That's it... You just looked at me  and acted right without even thinking.  And there are games you can play to  help you with this. Get up... (she does) Now, be my mirror... do exactly what  I do... that's it... now, at a certain  point, I'm going to become your  mirror, but I'm not going to tell  you when... you tell me...
88) 10) text: Matt nods.
88) 11) dialog: (enthusiastically) Okay. We're going to make up words.  The words aren't what matter now.
88) 13) dialog: You're a great dad.
88) 15) text: This acting exercise of Chicago's Story Theater leads int the song, "BE MY MIRROR." As the song finishes, Matt and  Jeannie are in the best spirits we've seen as an A.D.  approaches.
88) 18) text: She takes the A.D.'s hand as Matt calls.
88) 19) dialog: You're welcome. Don't mention it.
89) 0) text: Cathy is in mid conversation with Millie. Matt enters and boldly says his piece.
89) 1) dialog: I'm a free man. Let's go to your  house and break the answering machine.
89) 3) text: Millie, having been at the screen test viewing, is taken  aback, looking from one to the other. Cathy knows what sh thinking and is unnerved, feeling silently accused, as sh leads Matt out.
90) 0) text: Cathy's car followed by Matt in Burke's car. The frame ho both cars close as if this were one long car.
92) 1) dialog: I hope it's you.
92) 3) text: Matt waves...
92) 4) dialog: (delighted) So this is how the big ones make  out.
93) 3) dialog: What's the matter?
93) 5) dialog: Yes.
93) 7) dialog: Yes.
93) 11) dialog: You didn't like what I did?
93) 13) dialog: That's what it came down to?
93) 15) dialog: You folded on whether or not I'm  sexy. You don't think I'm sexy...  and you expressed that to...
94) 0) text: There is a longish line of cars behind Matt and Cathy.
95) 2) dialog: No. You were just... Aw, damn it, I  am. Very. Yes.
95) 3) text: Matt manages to pull to the side... the other cars gobbli the places behind Cathy, who sees this... and now she wat Matt's car recede from her view.
98) 1) dialog: Hello.
98) 4) dialog: I don't think I can get into this...
98) 6) dialog: Worse. You caught me at a bad time  you caused.
98) 8) dialog: (reinventing irony) Thanks.
98) 10) dialog: Yeah. Okay, good night.
102) 0) text: The parents, in the same variety of skin colors as the ch actors, are stuffed into a small room being patronized by the ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. Matt is grimly seated in the midd of a long sofa containing stage mothers. Another sofa is feet away; the parents strain at each other. The A.D. is  talking grandly but we cannot hear his words because the  Rainbow Parents are SINGING a phrase from the same song w heard in the make-up room. Matt does not take part in the singing. The music goes under allowing us to now hear the A.D.'s words.
102) 2) text: There is appreciative laughter from everyone save Matt, w rises in disgust and crosses out of the room.
102) 4) text: Matt ignores him and exits.
103) 3) text: Matt, growing concerned, walks on, then:
103) 7) dialog: Jeannie.
103) 9) dialog: Just remember. You're not even here  tonight. There's only this other  little girl that you're pretending  to be who lives at Rainbow House.
103) 11) text: Matt breaks up. Even Jeannie smiles briefly, then she tak him aside for privacy.
103) 13) dialog: Great.
103) 15) dialog: Great.
103) 17) dialog: Wouldn't miss it.
103) 19) dialog: Hey, then they'll just give you more  chances after everyone leaves.
103) 20) text: This does not satisfy her. She rolls her eyes as she is p away towards the front of the stage. Matt watches as the year-old veteran actor leads his little daughter towards debut.
104) 6) dialog: I don't want to miss her introduction.
104) 8) dialog: (distracted) I've got to see my kid.
104) 10) dialog: Hey. Good.
104) 13) text: Matt is terminally disappointed in her last cynical sente
104) 14) dialog: Oh, Cathy. Look, I'm going to watch  this. Let me talk to you later or  tomorrow. Thanks for your help. It's  good news. Gotta go.
104) 17) text: There is applause. Matt's missed her intro.
104) 18) dialog: Shit.
104) 20) dialog: Why couldn't you wait till later?  Shit.
104) 22) dialog: (after a moment) Huh?
104) 27) dialog: I think you're the best of the bunch.
104) 29) text: And now she raises her eyes--big, blue and vulnerable. If this look were returned, "I love yous" could flow--they c sink to the floor in a joint epiphany; but there is no ro or kindling in Matt's eyes. He is in a hurry. Pridefully, Cathy turns and walks off in the opposite direction, her  flight so instinctive, she forgets her book bag. We hold this--her exit, then:
105) 3) text: But Matt doesn't hear him... a few feet away, Jeannie is  making ready for her big moment. Three cameras swing in f of them, TV monitors showing a MASTER and CLOSE-UPS of th three characters in the scene: a short comic WHITE MAN, t Black Female Lead, and Jeannie, dressed as a poor child.
105) 4) dialog: (wide-eyed) Wait. This is it.
105) 10) text: A burst of laughter, whooping and applause from the audie Burke brags in a whisper to Matt.
105) 21) text: Matt, very much as he was when he watched Brando on the  plane... and then some. Burke, craning to make sure the  network bosses are suitably transported.
105) 30) dialog: (pridefully) You little stinker!
105) 32) dialog: My little stinker.
105) 36) dialog: (to Floor Manager) Amazing, right?
105) 39) dialog: You look happy.
105) 41) text: Matt starts to walk her back to the set.
105) 42) dialog: You want me to put you down?
105) 45) dialog: Okay... Now, you're not finished  until you hug the lady just like you  did me.
105) 47) dialog: I'm very proud of you. I love you  more than anybody.
105) 50) dialog: (a beat, then) Give me a kiss.
107) 0) text: Matt stands waiting for Jeannie. Nan approaches.
107) 2) dialog: This show didn't sell?!? How do you  know so fast?

107) 13) dialog: Honey...
107) 15) dialog: No. They're still having the party.
107) 17) text: To which Matt answers:
107) 18) dialog: Honey, we're going to close the place.
108) 8) dialog: This Oliver Stone thing... does he  really want me?
108) 10) dialog: Which part?
108) 12) dialog: One of the two leads wouldn't be  bad.
108) 14) dialog: Best part in the movie.
108) 17) dialog: I want to see my kid.
108) 22) dialog: You don't think I can tell you what  to do?
108) 24) dialog: Good luck.

109) 4) dialog: I never got to see your bow.
