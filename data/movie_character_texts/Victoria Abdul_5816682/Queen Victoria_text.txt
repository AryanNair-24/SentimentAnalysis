34) 7) dialog: Iam the Empress of India. What could be more appropriate than learning Urdu?
34) 9) dialog: You are absolutely right. I can’t have all of these distractions. Ponsonby, I wish to go to Glassalt Shiel.
34) 11) dialog: Alone.
34) 15) dialog: Oh, to be by oneself and live a simple rudimentary existence.
34) 17) dialog: They don’t understand anything, those stupid aristocratic fools. Toadying around. Jockeying for position. I’ve had my whole life. They couldn’t bear me bringing dear John Brown here. Yet I have been happier here than anywhere in the entire world. Oh, I miss him, Abdul. And Albert. It’s been thirty years and I think about him every day. I am s lonely, Abdul. Everyone I really loved has died. And I ju go on and on and on. She weeps.
34) 19) dialog: It’s an impossible position. No one really knows what it like to be Queen. I am hated by millions of people — all over the world. I have had nine children, all vain and jealous, and completely at loggerheads with each other. Bertie is a complete embarrassment. I have thirty-four grandchildren, my offspring will rule most of Europe — bu look at me: a fat, lame, impotent, silly old woman. What the point, Abdul?
34) 21) dialog: Of life?
34) 23) dialog: Service?!

35) 4) dialog: No, I like Abdul. Lady Churchill had better get used to t fact — as the Munshi is coming on holiday with us as a fu equal member of the Household.
35) 16) dialog: It was nothing at all, Abdul. Anyway, it’s a completely understandable mistake. I am just so glad you are with us What a treat to show you Florence for the first time. Bertie emerges from the royal bathroom in his pyjamas to
35) 18) dialog: Abdul was just explaining what happened earlier.
35) 20) dialog: I shared a bed with my mother until I became Queen.
35) 27) dialog: Abdul, I have something for you. To celebrate your first to Florence. And becoming my Munshi. It is a locket. With a picture of me. She gives him a locket.
35) 29) dialog: Keep me safe.
35) 31) dialog: Oh Abdul. You will love Florence. Such wonderful views.
35) 33) dialog: Isn’t it glorious. Albert loved it here. The Brunelleschi Dome. The Uffizi Gallery. He spent all of his money on Old Masters. We collected so much I had to give most of i to the National Gallery. He so admired the Medicis. That they would commission the greatest artists of the day. So they could leave something astonishing behind.
35) 37) dialog: Well, Iam the Empress of India. I should have a Durbar Room.
35) 39) dialog: The Isle of Wight. Obviously. Ponsonby arrives.
35) 43) dialog: And where did you say it was from, Mr Puccini?
35) 45) dialog: It sounds marvellous. 49
35) 47) dialog: Oh.
35) 49) dialog: Bravo.
35) 51) dialog: I’m not sure we do like the sound of it. We prefer comic opera. Do you know any Gilbert and Sullivan?
35) 53) dialog: Oh no. I couldn’t possibly. The Household on cue:

35) 67) dialog: Abdul, I have not been so happy for years.
35) 69) dialog: And you are very, very ‘unique’ to me, Abdul.
35) 72) dialog: (shocked) Wife?!

35) 78) dialog: Why didn’t you tell me you were married? 52
35) 80) dialog: (severely) Of course, this changes everything. You will have to retu to India immediately. Abdul looks concerned. And bring her back at once!

36) 25) dialog: How very nice to meet you. How are you enjoying England, Mrs Karim? Abdul translates this — at great length — to his missus. something to him — also at great length, then...
36) 32) dialog: My dear Munshi, Mrs Karim and Mrs Karim’s mother — it’s so good to have you back, my children. We have misse you enormously. 58 EXT. ABDUL’S COTTAGE. DAY A groom and pony-driven carriage wait for the Queen. The visitors are leaving. Bertie marches up the path, Ponsonb following close behind:
36) 35) dialog: Oh Abdul, I am so glad you are back — it really has been dreadfully dull without you. And I am so glad to meet Mrs Karim. There’s just one thing I’ve been curious about thi whole afternoon. What does Mrs Karim look like behind her veil?
36) 37) dialog: Is that allowed?
36) 39) dialog: Really?! You think she’d let me take a glimpse?
36) 42) dialog: Oh, you really are beautiful. Mrs Karim giggles again, not understanding a word. The Qu stands and takes both of her hands:
36) 43) dialog: Tum bahut sundar ho. [You are very beautiful.] Mrs Karim beams. Her mother watches inscrutably from her Abdul looks on at the whole scene, proud as Punch.
36) 44) dialog: Main tum yahaan hai bahut khush hoon. [I am so happy to have you here.]
36) 53) dialog: Prime Minister, you are late.
36) 55) dialog: Let us begin.
36) 57) dialog: This, as you can see, is the Indian corridor. The Durbar Room was designed by Mr Bhai Ram Singh. They pass a smiling Mr Bhai Ram Singh.
36) 59) dialog: And we commissioned a series of portraits. Of eminent Indians. This is Princess Gurmma. Lord Salisbury tries to feign interest as he looks at the
36) 60) dialog: This, of course . . . is the Munshi. 61 Salisbury looks horrified at the portrait of Abdul. Then upon the real Abdul who is in full Munshi uniform, a flow Abdul beams at the Prime Minister.
36) 62) dialog: A very good likeness. Don’t you think?
36) 65) dialog: And this, Prime Minister, is the Durbar Room.
37) 1) dialog: The carvings are all from Uttar Pradesh. And the carpet: The carpet was woven in a gaol in Agra. Perfect, of cours for the tableaux. 62 At the end of the room is the Peacock Throne.
37) 2) dialog: And the piéce de résistance. The Peacock Throne. The Queen sits on the throne. An exact copy of the one in Agra. And, of course, the Koh-i-Noor! She is wearing the Koh-i-Noor brooch.
37) 3) dialog: Now I really do feel like the Empress of India. She is like a little child, swinging her feet joyously. S household deputation look on at her:
37) 6) dialog: We have Abdul to thank for the whole idea.

37) 29) dialog: Bravo! Bravo the Munshi!
37) 34) dialog: Ah, Ponsonby. Tell us, what exactly did the Prime Ministe say about the tableau?
37) 36) dialog: Whatever for? He must have liked the Munshi.
37) 38) dialog: Really? I thought he was rather good.
37) 40) dialog: Of course Abdul has a prominent role in the household. He is my Munshi.
37) 42) dialog: Iam aware of it. 67
37) 44) dialog: I should have thought it was a jolly good message.
37) 46) dialog: Precisely. We owe them so much, do we not? For their role in the Mutiny, for example. The hubbub drops to a deathly silence.
37) 48) dialog: Yes. For all the help they gave us with the Hindus.
37) 50) dialog: Are you sure?
37) 52) dialog: Really?
37) 57) dialog: Ihave opened my heart to you. I have brought your family from India, promoted you in the teeth of very considerabl opposition and disquiet from the Household. I even turned a blind eye when you failed to tell me you were married, which came, as you know, as quite a surprise. How could you let me humiliate myself in front of the entire Househ
37) 59) dialog: You said the Hindus were behind the Mutiny!
37) 61) dialog: You told me categorically that the Muslims were my friends.
37) 63) dialog: Abdul, there is a fatwa against me. It was Muslims who started the whole thing! This is completely unacceptable. Abdul, I thought you were outstanding as the Sultan of Persia, but I’m afraid you will have to go home. 69
38) 1) dialog: You have hurt my feelings very much indeed, Abdul. Don’t you see what a position I have been put in? Thank you for everything you’ve done for me. She starts to leave. She turns and faces Abdul. We can se looking on behind her. I will miss you a very great deal. She turns and walks down the corridor. Queen Victoria marches along the corridor passing Bertie, and Lady Churchill, who dutifully follow her, smirking li have got the cream. Abdul is standing devastated. We see Mohammed has been wa

39) 3) dialog: Abdul, you have been an utter fool and I am absolutely furious with you. It is unconscionable that as my Munshi you should have lied to me in any way. But also it would completely churlish not to recognise the considerable kindness and devotion you’ve shown. And after all, I am sure you thought in some way you were protecting me. But as the monarch, I do realise nothing can really protect m And in that light I have decided, even though I am very disappointed, I would like you to stay. Abdul is astonished. 71
39) 6) dialog: Well, there is something we really must sort out, Abdul. Abdul has no idea what she could mean. Iam deeply concerned about Mrs Karim. INT. QUEEN’S BEDROOM. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY The Queen is having breakfast in bed attended by Dr Reid, and Mrs Tuck.
39) 7) dialog: I want you to examine Mrs Karim.
39) 9) dialog: Just make sure everything’s working.
39) 11) dialog: Whatever gave you that impression? Astonishment from all and sundry. The Munshi and his family are an integral part of the Roy Household. And I would be very grateful if you gave her a thorough examination. She blithely goes back to work on her egg. Dr Reid looks
39) 41) dialog: (out of shot) Dr Reid! The Queen comes round the corner, Suddenly Ponsonby et al round to see her with Lady Churchill, Miss Phipps et al.
39) 42) dialog: Iam not a fool. I know there is some skulduggery afoot. Something is going on here and I am not going to stand for it. Ponsonby et al. look terrified.
39) 43) dialog: Dr Reid, I asked you to get to the bottom of Mrs Karim’s fertility issues and it seems nothing has been done.
39) 45) dialog: Well, did you examine the Munshi?
39) 47) dialog: Well, examine the Munshi. The Queen heads off. Lady Churchill and Bertie hold back. 76
40) 14) dialog: Iam in the middle of my Urdu lesson.
40) 16) dialog: I have nothing to hide from Abdul.
40) 18) dialog: But the Munshi is from a noble family and a long line of teachers.
40) 23) dialog: You despicable toads. Racialists! Spying?! Dossiers?! Picking on a poor defenceless Indian. Of course they don’ have qualifications. It’s completely different out there.
40) 25) dialog: And how does that make him any different to any one of you? How dare you look down on Abdul. How dare you defame his poor father. Bertie, I am ashamed that you are part of this. Abdul is a loyal, wise, sympathetic human being who has risen on his own merits. Not by endless backstabbing or family connections. I will not have this. Now. Repeat after me. I will be courteous to the Munshi. She stares at Ponsonby. He looks at Abdul, then reluctant
40) 27) dialog: You.
40) 29) dialog: Bertie. All of you. ‘I will be courteous to the Munshi.’ 80
40) 31) dialog: It has become apparent that to get any respect in the Household one needs to be formally recognised. In which case, Abdul, I intend to give you a knighthood in the nex honours list. Ponsonby almost collapses.

40) 35) dialog: Well, you’re a doctor. Why don’t you treat him?! Now get out of my sight. All of you. INT. OUTSIDE THE QUEEN’S STUDY. OSBORNE HOUSE. DAY Abdul, Bertie, Ponsonby and Reid come out of the room. Su Dr Reid loses it and pins Abdul up against the wall.

40) 80) dialog: What is the meaning of this? Stop shaking.
40) 82) dialog: What did you say?
40) 84) dialog: Why the devil not?
40) 86) dialog: Demand?!
40) 88) dialog: Get out of my sight. 86 Miss Phipps looks like she’s beginning to crack.
40) 89) dialog: Did you not hear me?
40) 91) dialog: Treason! Treason! She sweeps the table in anger, evicting her Fabergé egg.
41) 2) dialog: I will not be disobeyed. 87
41) 4) dialog: Or?...Or?...
41) 6) dialog: Iam eighty-one years of age. I have had nine children, forty-two grandchildren, and almost a billion citizens. I have rheumatism, a collapsed uterus, am morbidly obese, deaf in one ear. I have known eleven prime ministers, passed 2,347 pieces of legislation. I have been in office sixty-two years, 234 days — thus I am the longest-serving monarch in world history. I am responsible for five households and a staff of more than three thousand. I am cantankerous, boring, greedy, ill-tempered, at times self and myopic, metaphorically and literally. I am, perhaps, disagreeably attached to power and should not have smashed the Emperor of Russia’s egg. But I am anything but insane. If the Household wish to disobey me, so be it let them do it face to face. I will see everyone in the D Room. At once! She marches out past Abdul: Where on earth did you get gonorrhoea?
41) 9) dialog: I would like to inform you that I have decided against awarding any knighthoods at this moment. Relief all round that she’s come to her senses.
41) 10) dialog: Instead, you will be delighted to know I have decided to make the Munshi a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order as a special token of my personal esteem for his services to the Empire. That will be all. Ponsonby is so overcome he has to sit down. The Queen is She walks through the middle of the crowd who part to obs customary obsequies. She walks out into the corridor.
41) 17) dialog: We need to talk.
41) 19) dialog: I think it’s time that you went home, Abdul.
41) 21) dialog: I have been short-sighted and selfish. You are a young ma Abdul. Your whole life ahead of you.
41) 23) dialog: I cannot protect you if I am not here. You must go, Abdul go with your wife. The vultures are already circling. I don think I will see this year out. All these stupid ceremoni What is the point in them, Abdul? They will kill me.
41) 25) dialog: No. Abdul, I am sick and weary. I can hardly see, barely hear. The Empress of half the world and I can’t get in an out of my own carriage.
41) 27) dialog: ‘You must protect yourself. How could we have been so blind? Forget me, Abdul. You have been a very good friend
41) 29) dialog: You are a silly fool, Abdul. But I adore you. Snow falls all around them. Abdul holds the Queen’s hand.
