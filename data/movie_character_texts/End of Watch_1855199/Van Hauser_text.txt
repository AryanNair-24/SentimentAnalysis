1) 89) dialog: Having fun? An older greying 25 year veteran lands at the locker by Taylor's and hurries to get dressed. This is VAN HAUSER, burned-out, beaten down. And still punching the clock.
1) 95) dialog: I'm telling Sarge you're taping in here.

7) 96) dialog: Sarge said I should relieve you guys so you can go be the street gods you are.

7) 105) dialog: I see you guys trying to be good little company men, doing the Lord's work. You have your nose up the command's ass. You're out here doing whatever it is you think you're doing. Making a difference as you call it. It's all fun and games. You get to run jump fight and shoot. Well one day, and mark my words. One day the LAPD is going to bend you over your black and white and fuck you up the ass. They will fuck you so long and so hard you'll want to eat your gun just to make it stop. And if you don't do it and the fucking somehow stops, they'll punish you for not eating your gun. They'll give you freeway therapy by assigning you to Devonshire daywatch. So you spend two hours on the freeway everyday thinking about the fucking they gave you. I was just like you Taylor. Exactly like you. Making a difference. At least the bad guys attack from the front. The department sneaks up from the rear. Watch your six. CAMERA catches the mortified expression of the young Rookie who overheard all that. Zavala grins and pulls a clear bottle from his pocket...
