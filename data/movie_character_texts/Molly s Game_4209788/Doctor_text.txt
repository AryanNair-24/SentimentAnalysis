10) 0) text: The 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL is in a hospital bed, post-op. From POV we can barely make out what a DOCTOR is saying to her FATHER and MOTHER.
10) 1) dialog: She’s gonna be fine, but I wouldn’t let her ski anymore. Definitely not moguls and skiing competitively is out of the question. The FATHER is quietly devastated and slumps down on the closest surface while the DOCTOR and the MOTHER assure hi that “...she’s gonna be fine, she just won’t ski”, etc. W stay on the 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL’s eyes--she’s clocked her father’s reaction and even through her post-op morphine h her eyes are fighting back. Blue Rev.
