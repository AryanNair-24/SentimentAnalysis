52) 55) dialog: Counsel? CHARLIE thinks...
52) 57) dialog: For the purposes of this hearing only?
152) 12) dialog: What is your full name?
152) 14) dialog: How old are you? The questioning continues. JUDGE FOXMAN (CONT’D) Have you taken any drugs, medicine or pills or had any alcoholic beverages in the past 48 hours?
152) 16) dialog: Is there anything about the reasons for your taking Sudafed that would interfere with what’s going on here today?
152) 23) dialog: I state for the record that I’ve also taken Sudafed in the last 48 hours.
152) 25) dialog: Is your mind clear today, Ms. Bloom?
152) 27) dialog: Do you understand what is going on here today?
152) 29) dialog: Under the Constitution and laws of the United States you have a right to plead to the charges in the indictment, do you understand that?
152) 31) dialog: And do you understand that?
152) 33) dialog: At that trial you would be presumed to be innocent and you would not have to prove that you were innocent, do you understand that?

152) 49) dialog: How do you plead to the charge?
152) 51) dialog: Your plea has been so recorded and you can take your seat. Before we move to the sentencing phase I'd like a word with counsel please. CHARLIE, HARRISON, and BRENNAN all stand up to approach t bench--
152) 53) dialog: (to CHARLIE) Pardon me, Mr. Jaffey, just government counsel. CHARLIE’s a little confused, this is very unusual.
152) 61) dialog: Would the defendant please rise for sentencing. CHARLIE stand.
152) 62) dialog: Based on all available information, this court manifestly disagrees with the government’s sentencing recommendation. This courthouse is located three streets from the financial district, which is populated by men and women who will commit more serious crimes by lunchtime today than the defendant has committed in this indictment. I simply don’t see how either the People or the cause of justice are served by locking Molly Bloom in prison. We see the family’s reaction--holding their breath, as CHARLIE closes his eyes a moment and exhales in relief an anticipation. The JUDGE continues semi-MOS--
152) 64) dialog: Ms. Bloom, this court sentences you to two-hundred hours of community service, one year of supervised probation and drug testing and a one-hundred thousand dollar fine. This case is adjourned. He raps his gavel. Everyone rushes a stunned Molly to congratulate her.
