0) 1) dialog: A survey was taken a few years ago that asked 300 professionals one question:
1) 1) dialog: “What’s the worst thing that can happen in sports?” We're at the bottom of the slope now where the skier we j saw finished her run with a swoosh, and a hundred or so spectators gave her a round. The skier snapped out of her skis, picked them up, pushed up her goggles and looked ba up the slope toward the judges...
1) 2) dialog: Some people answered losing a Game 7 and other people said getting swept in 4. Some people said--
2) 1) dialog: --it was missing the World Cup and some Brazilians said it was losing to Argentina. Not just in the World Cup--anytime, ever, in any contest. We can see the whole slope now. It looks like a terrible to die. It’s a moguls course, meaning that skiers race through a punishing series of 3-foot mounds of packed sno and ice, lift-off and execute a mid-air trick, land and r through another set of moguls, lift-off and execute a sec trick, land and race to the finish. Spectators and race officials line the sides of the slope Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 2.
3) 1) dialog: But one person answered that the worst thing that can happen in sports was 4th-place at the Olympics.
4) 1) dialog: This is a true story but except for my own I’ve changed all the names and I’ve done my best to obscure identities for reasons that’1l become clear. I’m Molly Bloom and right now I’m ranked 3rd in North America in Women’s Moguls.
5) 1) dialog: I have a BA in Political Science from the University of Colorado where I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a 3.9 GPA.
6) 1) dialog: I got a 173 on the L-SATs. The median L-SAT score at Harvard Law School is 169. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 3.
7) 1) dialog: I was raised in Loveland, Colorado, about an hour outside Denver or four hours if it’s snowing. On a weekend family ski trip when I was 5 I was spotted by a coach. The COACH stopped paying attention to the 12-YEAR-OLD BOY became captivated by the sight of a 5-YEAR-OLD GIRL--a prodigy--who’s just exploded into his field of vision. Th COACH watches and then glances back up the slope where th girl’s FATHER is standing and watching.
7) 4) dialog: I'd spend the next 18 years chasing winter and being coached by the best in the world.
8) 1) dialog: I also ran pretty well. A 12-YEAR OLD GIRL appears among the runners--both the fi kid and the first female we’ve seen. She’s running alongs her FATHER and you can tell just by looking at her stride that this is an athlete.
8) 2) dialog: I was running in a charity 5K when my back exploded.
9) 1) dialog: I had what’s called rapid onset scoliosis.
9) 3) dialog: My spine was curved at 63 degrees and I’d need a 7-hour surgical procedure that involved--
9) 5) dialog: --straightening my spine, extracting bone from my hip, fusing eleven vertebrae together and fastening steel rods to the fused segments.
10) 2) dialog: I was on skis again in a year, running moguls in 18 months and by my 20th birthday I’d made the U.S. Ski Team.
11) 0) text: It’s the slope we started at. Number 87 is MOLLY.
11) 2) dialog: It’s the last round of qualifying for the Salt Lake City Olympics. This is the Champion Run at Deer Valley. We can see that visibility is terrible, with snow coming diagonally and the wind whistling ominously at this altit
11) 3) dialog: The altitude’s 8100 feet and the pitch is 52 degrees which is the same as the sides of the Great Pyramids. MOLLY stomps on her feet to keep them warm and starts to loosen her shoulders and neck.
11) 4) dialog: The wind’s 20-25 miles an hour blowing left to right. It’s 3-below zero at the top of the slope and with 17 skiers in front of me, it’s gonna be like trying to stick a landing on a frozen infinity pool. The COACH points to his ears, indicating that it’s time f Molly to take out her ear buds. She hands the coach her i as he says--
11) 6) dialog: He’s talking about Kiki Bandy and Shannon Keebler, my two toughest competitors who had significant point deductions on their final runs--
12) 1) dialog: --setting the table for me. MOLLY snaps her boots into her bindings and taps her skis check how they feel.
12) 4) dialog: I can make the Olympic team right now. And if I have three perfect runs in Salt Lake--the best runs of my life--I can beat the Austrians and the Swiss and have a realistic shot at the podium. Then the law school of my choice and then a start-up. A foundation that seeds entrepreneurial women and also teaches young girls to ignore most of their current role models.
12) 6) dialog: But first this. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 7. A small light, accompanied by beeps, blinks red, then yel then-- MOLLY jams her poles into the snow and launches herself o the slope.
12) 7) dialog: Good start. My father’s at the bottom trying to telepathically get me to check my line.
13) 0) text: Molly’s FATHER is looking up the slope--
14) 1) dialog: I check my line. MOLLY’S POV Out of the sea of moguls she’s slashing through her eyes the path she’s chosen and, for a moment, it becomes demarcated for us like runway lights before it goes away.
15) 1) dialog: Good snow contact, calm upper-body, * legs together, good shape, no line deviation and set up for the D-Spin * and-- * MOLLY sails into the air and executes a perfect back-flip with an off-axis twist.
15) 2) dialog: --stick the landing. Now two things you need to know before the second trick which’ll be a 720. As MOLLY attacks the next set of moguls we start to gradu SLOW DOWN THE PICTURE... (MORE)
15) 4) dialog: The first is that when visibility * is bad the way it is now, race officials jam pine boughs in the snow at the edge of the jump so the skiers have some foreground depth reference. The second is that the * tightness of your bindings is determined by what’s called a DIN setting. If you’re a beginner your DIN setting is probably 2 or 3. If you’re an experienced weekend skier it’s probably 7 or 8. Mine’s 15. My boots are basically welded to my skis. Right...so how does this happen?-- In semi-slow motion, MOLLY gets airborne for her second t and almost as soon as she does, her right ski comes off a falls to the ground. All sound except Molly’s voice goes out.
15) 5) dialog: It happened because I hit a pine bough and I hit it so precisely * that it simply snapped the release on my bindings. Right in that moment I didn’t have time to calculate the odds of that happening because I was about to land pretty hard on my digitally remastered spinal cord which is being held together by spare parts * from an Erector Set. MOLLY crashes to the ice and snow with terrible impact. * We go back to FULL SPEED now with Molly’s other ski immediately snapping off and skidding away as MOLLY keeps sliding and flipping over. We're still without sound--just the occasional slap of he helmet on the packed snow. And then her helmet flies off before she breaks through--MOS--the wood and wire fence a into a group of gasping and shouting spectators. We watch the whole thing again full speed. And we watch o watch it--SPECTATORS, her COACH, the JUDGES, TELEVISION C and her FATHER... Sound kicks back in and we hear the gasping crowd along w radio crackle of the SKI PATROL and EMTs as they race to scene. Molly’s FATHER tries to get to her as fast as he c MOLLY’s on her back, unconscious, blood-soaked snow on he face. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 9.
15) 6) dialog: None of this has anything to do with poker. I’m only mentioning it because I wanted to say to whoever answered that the worst thing that could happen in sports was 4th place at the Olympics--seriously, fuck you.

16) 37) dialog: Every year on our birthdays my father would interview my younger brothers and me.
16) 41) dialog: How's this for hubris? *
16) 44) dialog: Even by teenage girl standards I would appear to be irrationally angry at nothing in particular. It would be another 7 years before I'd find out why.
17) 1) dialog: After my wipeout at Deer Valley I decided to take a year off before law school. Law school’s hard and I couldn’t spend the first year thinking about a pine bough. I needed to go away, sever myself from reality and come up with a new * plan so I chose Los Angeles, a city * whose entire population has severed itself from reality.

19) 1) dialog: I got a job working bottle service at a club in Hollywood called Nacional. It was Cuban-themed so my uniform was camouflage short-shorts and a white wife-beater.
20) 1) dialog: The promoter would go over which record producer was sitting where-- which hot designers, which Lakers and Jolo the Malaysian billionaire who didn’t drink but who ran a hundred-thousand dollar bar tab.

20) 8) dialog: But the club doesn’t need you to buy a bottle, they need you to buy five bottles. So these girls over here, they let you buy them shots for a living.

23) 1) dialog: I can’t tell you what my job was. I’m not saying it’s a secret, I literally can’t tell you what my job was. So I made it up. MOLLY’s sat down in front of an empty desk and regarded i for a moment. What is she supposed to do? She picks up th phone and checks for a dial tone.
24) 1) dialog: I filed contracts using a system I borrowed from the alphabet, with “B" following “A” and so forth.
25) 1) dialog: I answered the phone, made coffee runs, set appointments, made spreadsheets and showed Reardon what spreadsheets were. MOLLY’s pointing at her computer screen and explaining ho spreadsheet works to REARDON, dressed in his usual fatigu and skull t-shirt and looking at a copy of LA X-Press.

43) 1) dialog: I'd overheard stories about games that folded after one bad night and I needed this one to keep going and I needed to bring value to it. I knew if I wanted to cement my place there was one guy I needed to team up with and that was this man.
43) 3) dialog: The game had regulars and the game had guests and four of the regulars were famous actors and I’m going to call one of them Player X. Player xX subscribed to the belief that money won was twice as good as money earned. He lived to beat people and take their money.

He’s staring at his cards-- even a reasonably good amateur would know it was mathematically the best hand, which in poker is called the nuts. There was forty- seven thousand dollars in the pot and the guest was holding the nuts but he was starting to get confused because a movie star was talking to him.
43) 11) dialog: A fish is a particular kind of player. A fish has money. A fish plays loose and doesn’t fold a lot. A fish is good but not too good. PLAYER X looks over to MOLLY...MOLLY looks back and gives a half-smile. Chips get put down as a new hand is dealt.
43) 12) dialog: The Viper Room may have belonged to Reardon but the game belonged to Player X. People wanted to say they played with him the same way they wanted to say they rode on Air Force One. My job security was gonna depend on bringing him his fish. But where would I find people with a lot of money who didn’t know how to spend it and liked to be around celebrities?

CHARLIE points a bodyguard to where he wants Molly to sit four taped off seats on the right side toward the back. A MOLLY and the BODYGUARDS take their seats, CHARLIE stands the aisle a moment and looks at HARRISON, the lead prosecutor. HARRISON turns back from the bench and heads his table and sees Charlie. HARRISON half-smiles and give CHARLIE a small wave. CHARLIE gives him a small wave back takes his seat on the aisle next to one of the bodyguards MOLLY’s clocked all that.

54) 20) dialog: Alright, here it is: Banks are loaning you money and they shouldn’t. You’re a bad risk, they know that. So the debt service on your loans is close to 20 percent which is crazy. 20 percent is barely survivable if it’s a bridge loan but, for instance, it’s taken you 10 years to build seven houses, all of which are worth less than they were before you built them because the housing market’s on a downward trajectory for the first time in the history of houses and that’s why business is bad, not because you pay me four-hundred and fifty dollars a week.

You couldn’t buy me, you couldn’t buy the girls and you couldn’t buy a seat at the table. There’s nothing as sweet as a win you have to work for and the wins and losses were compelling and they were real. Of course it helped that the players were gambling addicts. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

67) 1) dialog: Next up was Harlan Eustis. MOLLY’s watching HARLAN play at one of the tables. He’s g big stack of chips in front of him.

67) 3) dialog: It wasn’t clear where his money came from. He produced backyard wrestling videos and other low-rent productions--

71) 2) dialog: Bad Brad had raised 45-million dollars for a fund that traded oil futures and every week he came to the game, lost a quarter of a million dollars and tipped me 10- thousand so he could play the next week. He wasn’t getting any better and the guys were feasting on him. BRAD loses another hand and walks over to Molly’s table.
71) 4) dialog: Hey, let’s talk for a second.
71) 6) dialog: Brad, this game may not be for you.
71) 12) dialog: No, you’re not. MOLLY shows BRAD her computer screen--
71) 13) dialog: These are your losses after ten weeks. And you’ve won...never. The strongest players have losing weeks and the weaker players get lucky but I’ve never seen someone not win, you know, ever. It’s actually a statistical anomaly.
71) 15) dialog: No, your tips are very generous. How about if I got you some books to read? Or even a pro to give you lessons?
71) 17) dialog: (pause) Okay. Sign for fifty-thousand. MOLLY pulls chips while BRAD signs on a clipboard.
71) 18) dialog: Turned out Bad Brad knew what he was doing. He was getting customers. He’d drop 200K at the game and pick up two-million for his hedge fund. DERRICK slaps BRAD on the back--

MOLLY’s phone buzzes and she sneaks a peak at the caller The BOYFRIEND clocks this.
71) 50) dialog: I wanted this man in the game, and not because he was People’s Sexiest Man Alive. I already had three of them at the table. But this one was a heavyweight--one of the biggest stars in the world. A 9-time Grammy winner whose last two albums debuted at Number-1 on the Billboard chart. Smart, charismatic, and influential, he wasn’t a recluse but you didn’t see him at parties or clubs. He was powerful fish bait, he was whale bait, he was an actual rock star and he was good business. And if I had him as an ally I wouldn’t be dependant on Player xX. MOLLY makes her decision, takes out her phone, tells her BOYFRIEND she’s sorry and she’ll be just a second and get the reaction you’d expect.

71) 134) dialog: There are no hard drives!
71) 136) dialog: You don’t understand what’s in those text messages.
71) 138) dialog: You don’t understand. There are going to be those messages and they’1ll be embarrassing but there are also going to be messages that would destroy lives. Other lives. There are messages that would end careers and obliterate families. If the text messages were made public--
71) 140) dialog: If they were--

71) 166) dialog: Here’s how I lost the LA game.
72) 6) dialog: Hey HEY! (to Harlan) You get out on the terrace.
72) 8) dialog: (to HARLAN) Out on the terrace. Now. MOLLY motions to CASSIE, the relief dealer, the way a baseball manager would motion to the bullpen. MOLLY walks DIEGO away from the table--
72) 9) dialog: (quietly) You good?
72) 11) dialog: Have a drink. MOLLY goes out on to--
73) 1) dialog: What the hell.
73) 3) dialog: Yeah and you’re gonna go home, I’m making a floor call, that’s it. HARLAN doesn’t say anything--he just stares out at Los Angeles...
73) 4) dialog: (pause) Did you hear me?
73) 7) dialog: (beat) You don’t have what? HARLAN looks at MOLLY very simply...
73) 9) dialog: It was 5am on Saturday. This game began at 7pm on Thursday.
74) 2) dialog: Harlan Eustice was the producer of backyard wrestling videos who Player X badly wanted in the game. Harlan was excited about the surprise 40th birthday party he was throwing for his wife in 24 hours.
74) 4) dialog: I liked Harlan. There was no affectation, no Hollywooding, no flossing--he wasn’t ticking off the menu items to show off, he was genuinely excited about the party he was giving his wife.
74) 6) dialog: But nobody else liked him except Player X. (MORE )
74) 8) dialog: He played tight, didn’t give a lot of action and always got his money in good which means he was running the odds. In other words he was playing poker and the others were gambling. In a SERIES OF SHOTS we see HARLAN folding hands--
74) 16) dialog: And he won.
75) 1) dialog: By midnight Harlan had tripled his original fifty-thousand dollar buy- in but everything came off the rails with one hand. And that’s how it happens, that’s how you go full tilt. Harlan, the best player at the table, the best player at most tables, was about to get bluffed off the nuts by, of all people, Bad Brad. CASSIE turns over a fifth card--a king. He OK Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 92.
75) 2) dialog: How? Because this was only Brad’s second game, Harlan hadn’t been at his first, and Harlan didn’t know yet that Brad was bad. Animation shows Harlan’s hand--an 8 and a 9--which when a to the table cards (KQ899) gives Harlan a full house.
75) 3) dialog: Harlan’s got a boat, nine’s full. Animation shows Brad with a 3 and a 5, which when added t the table cards equals nothing.
75) 4) dialog: Brad’s got nothing but his pre-flop betting made it look, entirely accidentally, like there was a chance he had pocket kings, which, if true, would give him the better full house. HARLAN counts his chips and pushes some into the pot--
75) 6) dialog: And there it is. Brad’s counting off 30-thousand which means he’s gonna call and Harlan knows that if Brad’s gonna call and not raise it means he didn’t have the boat and he’s betting a high two-pair-- probably kings and queens. But then instead of calling the bet-- BRAD pushes ALL his chips in--
75) 8) dialog: --Brad pushes 72-thousand dollars into the pot. Harlan looks at Brad. Every tell Harlan knows about-- carotid artery pumping, stiff hands- -Brad’s doing the opposite. Harlan’s betting had represented a huge hand by calling on the flop, check-raising the turn and bombing the river. (MORE )
75) 10) dialog: Of course Harlan didn’t know that Brad didn’t know what any of that meant. So Harlan, always a good sport, said--
75) 12) dialog: --as he tossed in what he didn’t realize was the winning hand. Brad tosses in his cards too and one of them flips over and Harlan sees it’s not a king.
75) 18) dialog: It wasn’t even that it was that much money--Harlan only lost about 40-thousand on the hand-- HARLAN gets up and starts pacing around the room.
75) 19) dialog: --but a circuit breaker blew and Harlan was out for blood. Everyone's. HARLAN walks up to MOLLY--
75) 21) dialog: (quietly) You’ve got 51-thousand on the table, you want another 50?
75) 23) dialog: (beat) Sign here for 100-thousand. MOLLY starts to pull the chips and we --
76) 0) text: HARLAN watches while another pair of hands haul in the po He gets up and goes to MOLLY.
76) 1) dialog: By 5am Harlan was down half a million. He'd abandoned everything he knew about poker and was playing like a frat kid--swinging for a home run on every hand.
76) 3) dialog: Harlan--
76) 5) dialog: Sign here for a hundred.
77) 1) dialog: Text messages were going out letting everyone know Harlan was bleeding. Guys were coming by to play for a couple of hours before work. They'd been losing to him for months. Everyone wanted a check from Harlan Eustice.
77) 2) text: Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 95. HARLAN’s pouring himself a Red Bull and vodka as Molly wa up to him.
77) 3) dialog: If you go home now you can get a few hours sleep before Sheila’s party.
77) 5) dialog: You’re on tilt--everybody knows it. * And you're playing without the ammunition you need to win.
77) 7) dialog: (beat) * Alright, thank you.
77) 10) dialog: That should be the second line of every gambler’s obit. “Mr. Feldstein died while trying to get back to even.” Harlan never did. And he never got to his wife’s birthday party. She filed for divorce two days later but there was one last punch coming that would put Harlan on the floor for good.
78) 1) dialog: Harlan was heads-up against a guy named Frederick who was Austrian royalty--the son of a Count in the House of Habsburg and a distant cousin of Marie Antoinette. Again, we see animation on the screen as MOLLY describes their hands.
78) 2) dialog: Harlan had pocket queens. His Excellency had Ace-King. They were both in 65K pre-flop. DIEGO burns a card and then deals three in the middle.
78) 3) dialog: The flop’s queen-seven-seven. Harlan has a full-house again, queens full of sevens--with three rounds of betting in front of him. The Count has nothing. FREDERICK stacks his chips and pushes them all in.
78) 4) dialog: And the Count goes all in. He wants Harlan to think he’s got two more sevens under there. Bite me, says Harlan, he’s not falling for this again and he snap calls all in. There’s $750,000 on the table. Diego burns a card and deals the turn. A king. Otto von Bismarck now has two pair, kings and sevens, but two-pair’s nothing next to a full house. And at this point, the only hand left that can beat a queen full house-- DIEGO turns over the fifth card. It’s a king--
78) 5) dialog: --is a king full house. Captain von Trapp bluffed two pair and rivered into kings full! Then all of a sudden--
78) 10) dialog: Hey HEY! (to HARLAN) You get out on the terrace.
78) 12) dialog: (to Harlan) Out on the terrace. MOLLY motions to CASSIE, the relief dealer, the way a baseball manager would motion to the bullpen. MOLLY walks DIEGO away from the table--

79) 10) dialog: We’ll meet tomorrow and talk about what to do. (beat) And what you’ve gotta do is tell Sheila the truth, okay, you tell her the truth. Tell her what happened. And I’m gonna help you, I’m gonna get you to a meeting. We'll talk tomorrow and figure out what to do about the money.

80) 5) dialog: You’re taking 50% of his wins and no exposure on the losses.
80) 7) dialog: First of all he’ll never climb out of that, that’s sharecropper math. Second, you can’t stake a player and play in the game at the same time.

Drink a lot of water, get some air and think about this for 30 minutes. If you’re still sure it’s a good idea in 30 minutes, call me back.

The musician and his girlfriend stayed together on the condition that he not play in my game and that was all Player xX needed to get the other guys to fire me.

86) 52) dialog: It’s not true.
86) 54) dialog: I know how it works. Points correspond to the prosecutor's sentencing recommendation. You try to get point reductions based on a variety of factors including, say, prior criminal history, which I don’t have, or whether the defendant played a minor role, which I certainly did not.

MOLLY picks up a magazine and starts thumbing through it.
92) 3) dialog: That was it, that’s what was making me angry. It was that there weren’t any rules. These power moves weren’t framed by right and wrong, just ego and vanity. She puts the magazine back and picks up a different one.

Bellmen are bringing in stools.

The chips beautiful and heavy and engraved with Molly’s initials. * Included among the chips are rectangular gold plates that “MB” but have no denomination. *
107) 6) dialog: I used custom chips and two dealers who worked an hour on, an hour off with a new crew coming in after twelve hours. * --The female dealer, a tall knockout, fans a deck out in front of her and sweeps it up with one card. She repeats as well as a few other simple tricks that show how fast a nimble her hands are.

108) 11) dialog: Hey, can I show you something on
108) 14) dialog: This is last Tuesday night’s game.
108) 16) dialog: (pointing) This is you in the seventh chair. Look at your stack of chips.

108) 20) dialog: Come on, Cole. 1:07 you lose the hand to Boosty. 1:08. (she fast forwards to 1:08) Our sheets say you didn’t buy in again between 1:06 and 1:08 but look at that--your stack got bigger.
108) 22) dialog: So let’s rewind. This screen's got the dealer changeover while at the same time back on this screen... aaaaaand--there we are. We PUSH IN on the TV and see COLE drop his hand below the table--presumably into his jacket pocket--take out a cigarette and casually drop some chips in front of himsel like he’d been playing with the chips all along.
108) 23) dialog: And that’s why I can’t reconcile seventeen-thousand dollars from Tuesday’s game. (pause) A 7-11's got security cameras on their Slushy machine, I’ve got a million dollars changing hands every two minutes, imbecile, you didn’t think I had eyes on the table? COLE starts breathing heavily--
108) 24) dialog: Shh--relax.
108) 26) dialog: I know, so why isn’t it coming out of the trust fund. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 126.
108) 28) dialog: Alright. Look, first of all, those guys who make the counterfeit chips, they’re taking you for a ride. They know there are signatures built into the chips-- exact weight, infra-red markings-- * breathe. Second, don’t try this at someone else’s game because they’re gonna express their anger in a much different way than I am. I'll cover you, You owe me 17-thousand dollars * and when I get it I’ll give you the tape. That’s it.

110) 0) text: A hand is underway with SMALL dealing. MOLLY watches from short distance as the pot gets bigger and bigger.
110) 1) dialog: Around 2am there was a pot that was up to a million and a half pre-flop with five players still in. SMALL burns a card and lays out the flop.
110) 2) dialog: My hope was that the flop would chase four of them off.
110) 10) dialog: There was now two-point four million on the table.
110) 12) dialog: Two-point six million.
110) 15) dialog: Three million. SMALL burns another card and lays out the turn. MOLLY’s thinking.
110) 16) dialog: She was right, I was extending credit, big numbers. And it’s not like Harlan Eustice hadn’t already put the fear of God into me. If I couldn’t pay, one time, that’d be the end of the game. I was the house. She catches SMALL’s eye and holds up two fingers while mouthing “Two”. SMALL’s quick hands begin to stack the chips in the pot, knocking two percent off one of the stacks, tapping those chips on the table so the players know she’s doing it and sliding the chips to the side.
110) 17) dialog: That’s how quickly I’d made the decision. And just as quickly, Small calculated two percent of the pot and took it off the table. That was it. (MORE )

111) 2) dialog: He was hard to understand when he was drunk and his conversation openers would always sound like the title of a detective novel.

113) 1) dialog: He talked about wanting a better life.
113) 3) dialog: Good call.
114) 1) dialog: And he’d talk about another game he played in. It was the Brooklyn game. The Brighton Beach game where they played all night and all day. The game that was populated by Russians.
115) 1) dialog: Then one night Douglas Downey lost eighty-thousand at my game and didn’t have it.
115) 3) dialog: You won a hundred and ninety last week.
115) 5) dialog: Got it.
115) 7) dialog: Doug--
115) 9) dialog: Quiet down, listen to me--
115) 11) dialog: I don’t even know what that means but you can’t stiff Eddie Ting or Irv Gotti.
115) 13) dialog: You really should be.
115) 15) dialog: There’s another way.
115) 17) dialog: Douglas.
115) 19) dialog: The Brooklyn game. Is everything I’ve heard true?
115) 21) dialog: Yeah.
115) 23) dialog: That the Russians have deep pockets, are bad at poker, give action and pay instantly. Bring me some of those players and I’1ll give you a piece of the game until your 80K’s paid down.
115) 25) dialog: Did you understand what I said?
115) 27) dialog: I’m not Irish.
115) 29) dialog: No.
115) 31) dialog: You're thinking of the James Joyce character--
115) 33) dialog: I’m not. Can you get me some of those players?
115) 35) dialog: Doug. Focus up. Yes, there is a book by James Joyce called Ulysses that has a character named Molly Bloom and that is why you think I’m Irish and now it’s time to get past that. Can you get me some Brighton Beach players?
115) 37) dialog: I’m a Russian Jew.
115) 38) dialog: The next week I had some new players.
116) 1) dialog: Mike was the first one to arrive.
116) 4) dialog: Mike owned a chain of medical clinics and had already posted with a wire transfer.
116) 8) dialog: Next were the Gershen brothers, Illya and Alex. They were in the business of exporting steel to China. Alex brought a quarter of a million dollars in cash ina backpack.
116) 10) dialog: And then Helly Habib. The Habib family owns the largest collection of classical art in the world, valued at 3-billion dollars, and Helly runs the Habib gallery on Madison Avenue.
116) 11) dialog: I’ll need you to post the first few times, I hope you understand. (handing him a card) Here’s information about wiring the post in advance.
116) 13) dialog: (pause--calmy) That is...an authentic Monet?
116) 15) dialog: (pause) You came over here carrying a Monet.
116) 20) dialog: Okay. Helly, here’s what I need you to do. I need you to get this, what, 20--?
116) 23) dialog: --27-million dollar painting out of here right now. And your, I assume, armed security--?
116) 25) dialog: --can’t stand in front of the door. Fix that up, come on back and I’1l extend you credit tonight up to one and a half.
117) 2) dialog: Mike, Illya, Alex and Helly. Those were the players Douglas Downey brought me. As advertised, they played loose, gave action, lost to the regulars and settled right away.
117) 4) dialog: People have asked, “Wasn’t there any way to tell that the new players were connected to one of the darkest, deadliest and far- reaching organized crime syndicates in the world?” No. There wasn’t.
117) 8) dialog: Harrison Wellstone didn’t go for the minor role reduction?
117) 10) dialog: He didn’t buy that I was a cocktail waitress?
117) 12) dialog: Aww. (claps him on the shoulder) Was it because I wasn’t?
117) 14) dialog: So what now? CHARLIE looks at MOLLY--he knows this is going to be a difficult subject.
117) 16) dialog: You don’t say.
117) 18) dialog: Who could’ve possibly seen that coming?
117) 21) dialog: It’s gonna be very short because I don’t know anything at all that can help them.
117) 23) dialog: Did you know that 97 percent of federal cases never go to trial? Even though your chance of being convicted at trial is a little more than one in a hundred?
117) 25) dialog: Which the Justice Department knows I don’t have because they took all my money in a civil forfeiture which they can do without a warrant because your property doesn’t have a presumption of innocence. Then after I was arrested by 17 agents holding automatic weapons--totally necessary and not at all meant to intimidate me--they gave me two days to hire a lawyer and appear in a courtroom on the other side of the country.
117) 27) dialog: So tell me all the ways I can help ‘cause I really feel I owe it to them. Speaking of owing, the IRS has put a tax lien on the money they took from me.
117) 32) dialog: Taking my money wasn’t a tax, they also need me to give them my money. * Or they’1ll take it again.
117) 34) dialog: It needed to be said.
117) 36) dialog: That’s right.
117) 38) dialog: --like the neighborhood extortionist? No. The U.S. Attorney's Office does everything within the law to fight crime and also for some reason to keep taking my stuff, I get it. And if I had testimony that could lead to the conviction of a bad guy no one would have to coerce me into cooperating. But I don’t. I have dirt. I have dish. I have gossip. So my value to the prosecution is exactly the same as it is to Hollywood. I’m here to ensure the New York Post covers the trial. I’m here to sell tickets.

117) 42) dialog: What does he have you doing now? STELLA’s getting an essay out of her backpack and giving to her father.

I said sure and set the meeting for 5pm on a Thursday at the Four Seasons bar, knowing that if they were legit they'd recognize someone in the crowd at Happy Hour at the Four Seasons right after the closing bell.

129) 2) dialog: It turns out I didn’t need to be that clever. These weren’t finance guys, they were from the cast of Jersey Boys.
