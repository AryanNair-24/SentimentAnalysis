41) 17) dialog: I’m Charlie Jaffey.
41) 19) dialog: You've met my daughter Stella? Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 29.
41) 21) dialog: (to Stella) Isabel’s gonna be here in 45 minutes to take you to school. Did you finish the math?
41) 23) dialog: Civ?
41) 25) dialog: Do you know it? Could you teach it to your class today? If I asked you about Roman law, could you tell me?
41) 27) dialog: ‘Kay, keep reading. MOLLY clocked that. CHARLIE (CONT’D) (to Molly) There aren’t too many people here this early but we’ll have coffee soon. Come on back to my office. MOLLY follows CHARLIE down a hallway-- CHARLIE (CONT’D) First thing’s first, when was the last time you slept? (beat) Today’s Friday.
41) 29) dialog: In here. They walk into-- INT. CHARLIE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS It’s a beautiful corner office with jetliner views of the river.
41) 31) dialog: Why didn’t you hire any of them?
41) 33) dialog: Yeah, there were 31 people named in your indictment--it’s Black Friday for criminal lawyers. What about the other two?
41) 35) dialog: Uh-huh.
41) 37) dialog: Why?
41) 41) dialog: (pause) I've been briefed a little by my daughter who knows a lot about your story because her mother’s a moron.
41) 43) dialog: I’ve read some of the tabloids and I read the indictment after I got your call last night and I bought your book. CHARLIE’s picked up a copy of Molly’s Game-- CHARLIE (CONT’D) I’m only up to page 81, but Molly? Did you commit a felony and then publish a memoir about it?
41) 45) dialog: Just to nail down the timeline, you ran games in LA for roughly six years?
41) 47) dialog: Without taking a rake.
41) 49) dialog: Then you ran games in New York for roughly two years? 31.
41) 52) dialog: Then your game got raided, the government took all your money ina civil forfeiture and you left town.
41) 54) dialog: And it was there that you wrote this book.
41) 56) dialog: The book was released three weeks ago, you did a press tour and moved back to LA.
41) 58) dialog: And that’s where you were arrested by the FBI.
41) 60) dialog: (pause) So...In the first 81 pages you name a bunch of names.
41) 62) dialog: You gave up the names of some movie stars who played in your game. MOLLY takes a moment...this is obviously a sore spot for and she’d rather not talk about it.
41) 64) dialog: Isn’t that against some sort of poker code?
41) 66) dialog: Wouldn’t it be great if there were, though?
41) 68) dialog: My retainer’s $250,000, do you have
41) 71) dialog: What about sales of the book?
41) 73) dialog: Not to the guys you named.
41) 75) dialog: (laughing) Unfortunately the people I'd ask are goin’ away for a while. What happened Tuesday morning was called a GPS Takedown. 31 people were arrested in the same instant. Someone you thought was a friend called you on your phone to make sure it was the one you were still using and when you answered that call, they had you painted and kept track of your movements until the agreed upon time. (MORE )
41) 77) dialog: Something in excess of 600 agents were dispatched to locations in New York and LA in coordinated strikes with automatic weapons and you’re trying to tell me you’re in my office because you raked a game of Texas Hold ‘Em?!
41) 79) dialog: Have you seen the other names on this indictment? Helly Habib, Mike Druzhinsky, Mike Anikovich, the Gershen Brothers? How deep were you into the Russian mob, Molly?! ‘Cause so far your tell-all doesn’t say. MOLLY’s well past tired and Charlie’s quick cross-examina has either taken something out of her or put something ba in. She stands up and walks to the window...
41) 81) dialog: So she can see what happens when a group of bored teenage girls gossip.
41) 83) dialog: Many consider it to be the best play of the 20th Century.
41) 85) dialog: I don’t defend violent criminals.
41) 87) dialog: Your friends have. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 35.
41) 89) dialog: And the other 10 percent?
41) 91) dialog: (pause) Let me ask you something. Reardon-- in the book--he didn’t say “Poor people bagels,” did he. (beat) I think I know who he is, I think I know a real estate lawyer who worked with him and quit. He called them “nigger bagels,” right?
41) 93) dialog: But you were willing to name the movie stars.
41) 95) dialog: Were you paid extra in your book deal to name the movie stars?
41) 97) dialog: I’m not your guy, Molly. I wish you good luck but this just isn’t for me. MOLLY hears that but still doesn’t leave...
41) 99) dialog: My daughter.
41) 101) dialog: That and I was usually one of the few people who knew where witnesses were being hidden.
41) 103) dialog: Mm-hm. *
41) 105) dialog: Not really.
41) 107) dialog: We do pro bono work--we regularly lend out our best litigators like me to the ACLU, Southern Poverty Law Center, veterans groups--but I * don’t think I can convince my partners to take a flyer on the Poker Princess.
41) 109) dialog: “Molly Bloom, the self-proclaimed Poker Princess...”. *
41) 112) dialog: I'd be amazed.
41) 114) dialog: You don’t need me, you need a publicist.
41) 116) dialog: (pause) You never answered my question. When was the last time you slept?
41) 118) dialog: (pause) I’m gonna walk you through the arraignment this morning, you shouldn’t do that alone. I’m gonna put some bodies on you and walk you through a side door. ‘Cause I don’t know what you’ve got on the Russians but neither do they and the Russians take care of shit, you understand what I’m saying?
51) 0) text: CHARLIE is standing and waiting as MOLLY and the bodyguar come in and walk through a metal detector. They all make their way down the hall--
51) 1) dialog: Here’s all that’s gonna happen today. The judge is gonna ask each defendant if they’ve read the indictment or if they’d like the court to read it to them. Then the judge is going to ask you how you plead and you’ll answer, “Not Guilty.” I’ll make it clear for the record that I’m not your counsel but that I’m appearing on your behalf at the arraignment. In propria persona.
51) 3) dialog: Yeah.
51) 5) dialog: I am appearing on your behalf.
51) 7) dialog: (beat) I’ll check that out but the point is I’m not your lawyer and I’1l make that clear for the record. He stops her before they walk into the courtroom and show little compassion... CHARLIE (CONT’D) Look...my office’ll give you a list of names when we’re done. There are plenty of firms that’ll just be happy for the exposure. You'll be fine.
51) 9) dialog: (pause) Alright. It’s a scary room. Don’t be scared.
52) 0) text: The courtroom is huge and ornate and right now it’s a bit a spectacle. On the right side of the gallery are the defendants and t lawyers--about 60 people in all. Behind a plexiglass partition are some more defendants in prison coveralls an shackles. The defendants range in age from early-20’s to 80's. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 50. On the left side of the gallery are the wives and girlfri of the defendants. They’re all beautifully dressed and manicured and have on some of their gaudiest jewelry for occasion. Seated in back of them are the press and it was a tough ticket to get. At the prosecutor’s table are three Assistant U.S. Attorn including HARRISON WELLSTONE, the lead attorney on the ca who we’ll get to know later. JUDGE DUSTIN FOXMAN is already seated at the bench and is quietly going over some business with the prosecutors as packed courtroom hums with quiet chatter. CHARLIE points a bodyguard to where he wants Molly to sit four taped off seats on the right side toward the back. A MOLLY and the BODYGUARDS take their seats, CHARLIE stands the aisle a moment and looks at HARRISON, the lead prosecutor. HARRISON turns back from the bench and heads his table and sees Charlie. HARRISON half-smiles and give CHARLIE a small wave. CHARLIE gives him a small wave back takes his seat on the aisle next to one of the bodyguards MOLLY’s clocked all that.
52) 1) dialog: (quietly to MOLLY) You got a good judge, he’s a good guy.
52) 8) dialog: (quietly to the bodyguard) Switch with me a second. CHARLIE and the BODYGUARD switch places so that Charlie’s sitting next to Molly now. CHARLIE (CONT’D) (quietly) Do you know what a “Vor v Zakone” is? A “Vor"?
52) 10) dialog: The literal translation is “thief- in-law.” It’s the Russian equivalent of a Don or a Godfather. Nikolai Illyanovich is a Vor. He's the one who tried to fix the Salt Lake City Olympics.
52) 12) dialog: He’s also had a lot of people killed. It’s basically do what I’m telling you or we’ll kill your kids.
52) 14) dialog: (pointing to a man behind the plexiglass) He’s standing right there. I can introduce you guys, you’re co- defendants. (to the BODYGUARD) Switch back. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 52. CHARLIE and the BODYGUARD switch back to their original seats. The business of the court continues.
52) 27) dialog: (whispering to the
52) 30) dialog: (beat) Okay. (pause--then quietly) Your old boss--the one you call Reardon--he was kind of a jerk to you. Why would you cover for him by changing it to “poor people bagels”? ee OK
52) 32) dialog: (shrugs) * Just making conversation. *
52) 33) text: CHARLIE’s not really satisfied but he taps the bodyguard they switch back.
52) 39) dialog: Good morning, Your Honor. Charles Jaffey, just for the purposes-- And CHARLIE stops mid-sentence and thinks...
52) 41) dialog: Just a moment please, sir. (to the BODYGUARD) Switch back. They switch--
52) 43) dialog: You said you left ten-times that much on the street. Back at my office. I said it’s a $250,000 retainer and you said you left ten times that on the street.
52) 46) dialog: Please the Court Your Honor, just one moment. (to Molly) You were extending credit. You’re destitute and you left two anda half million dollars on the street?
52) 48) dialog: Didn’t anyone try to buy your debt sheet?
52) 50) dialog: Why didn’t you sell it like you sold your clothes?
52) 52) dialog: Why?
52) 54) dialog: (pause) I was afraid you were gonna say that.
52) 56) dialog: (pause) Charles Jaffey for the defendant, Your Honor.
52) 58) dialog: No sir, I’m Molly Bloom’s attorney. She’s read the indictment, discussed it with her lawyer, waives her right to have it read to her and pleads “Not Guilty”. HARRISON clocks this, smiles and shakes his head.
52) 61) dialog: I'll need to keep reading your book.
71) 63) dialog: Hey. C’mon in. Throw your coat anywhere.
71) 65) dialog: How was your flight?
71) 67) dialog: How are you paying for plane tickets between LA and New York? Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
71) 69) dialog: It was. So you had meetings.
71) 71) dialog: You had meetings out in LA about the book?
71) 73) dialog: With the studios.
71) 75) dialog: You have an agent working with you?
71) 77) dialog: Was there interest?
71) 79) dialog: Anything else?
71) 81) dialog: Treat?
71) 83) dialog: They want you to pose naked.
71) 85) dialog: I meant interest in the book.
71) 87) dialog: Any offers?
71) 89) dialog: Really.
71) 91) dialog: And...?
71) 93) dialog: You passed on seven offers.
71) 95) dialog: No, I’m just curious why you passed on seven offers.
71) 97) dialog: Okay, you see this? CHARLIE’s motioned to a stack of documents-- CHARLIE (CONT’D) This is discovery. Let’s see what we've discovered. CHARLIE will draw a crude diagram on a white board as he speaks. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 82. CHARLIE (CONT’D) Over here we have Michael Druzhinsky, Michael Anikovich and Michael Slobo. The three Mikes. CHARLIE draws three “M”s and puts a circle around it. * CHARLIE (CONT’D) The three Mikes run a chain of corrupt medical clinics and they’ve been committing insurance fraud, wire fraud and mail fraud on an epic scale. Over here is the Taiwanchik-Gershen Organization. * CHARLIE writes “TGO” and draws a circle around it. * CHARLIE (CONT’D) They’re a worldwide bookmaking operation handling hundreds of millions of dollars a year in illegal sports betting. And over here is the Habib-Gershen * Organization. * CHARLIE writes “HGO” and draws a circle around it. The th organizations are now in a triangle on the white board. CHARLIE (CONT’D) Also an illegal bookmaking operation but this one financed by an art gallery owned by Hillel Habib who everyone calls-- *
71) 99) dialog: (pause) This is the Russian mafia. And the three are tied together in the indictment through...? A poker game. CHARLIE writes “Molly” in the middle of the triangle and draws a circle around it.
71) 101) dialog: No. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)
71) 103) dialog: They were tapping the phones of everyone you talked to.
71) 105) dialog: Druzhinsky’s phone was tapped. They’ve got you confirming that you ran raked games at various locations in New York and they've also got a confidential informant confirming that you ran raked games at various locations in New York. You were in violation of 1955-- that’s the part of the U.S. Code that makes it illegal to run an illegal gambling business. (pause) You know what you did? You finished writing your book before the good part happened.
71) 107) dialog: I don’t like this picture.
71) 109) dialog: You look like the cat who ate the canary and then told the canary’s parents about it.
71) 111) dialog: I liked the book though. A good story well told.
71) 113) dialog: I need you to tell it again. From the beginning and this time without leaving anything out. Would you like a glass of water?
71) 115) dialog: And one more thing.
71) 117) dialog: I need your hard drives.
71) 119) dialog: What do you mean?
71) 121) dialog: You’re kidding.
71) 123) dialog: They have more than that. Every time you charge your phone by plugging it into your computer the computer records all your text messages and e-mails.
71) 125) dialog: I want to run a forensic imaging of your hard drives.
71) 127) dialog: You can’t, they’re evidence.
71) 129) dialog: You already told me they exist.
71) 131) dialog: I can’t do that.
71) 133) dialog: Molly--
71) 135) dialog: If you destroy evidence and obstruct justice on top of the charges already brought against you in this case, you will, I promise you, be incarcerated.
71) 137) dialog: I understand that you’ve had boyfriends and that there are gonna be private exchanges.
71) 139) dialog: They won't be. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 86.
71) 141) dialog: They won't be.
71) 143) dialog: I’m a lawyer. I’m legally--
71) 145) dialog: Listen to me, I’m legally prohibited from disclosing--
71) 147) dialog: Hang on. CHARLIE walks to his desk and picks up his copy of Molly’ Game.
71) 149) dialog: The movie stars you named in the book--you’d already named them under oath in the Bad Brad Marion deposition.
71) 151) dialog: That’s not what I’m getting at. Your lawyer back then--Butterball--
71) 153) dialog: Butterman leaked your deposition to the tabloids?
71) 156) dialog: That’s why those were the only real names you used in the book, the ones that were given up by Butterbean.
71) 158) dialog: And is that why you have creative differences with the Hollywood offers? They want information you won’t give them?
71) 160) dialog: What’s on the hard drives, Molly? Famous married guys hitting on you? MOLLY nods her head “yeah”. CHARLIE picks up his cell phone and tosses it to her.
71) 162) dialog: It’s got every e-mail and text message I’ve sent in the last year as well as a variety of incriminating evidence about my clients. If anything of yours leaks you can sell my phone to the highest bidder and I'll lose my job and be disbarred. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 88.
71) 164) dialog: I know you’re not gonna read it. If you're having a hard time trusting me, maybe it’ll help to know I trust you. MOLLY takes a long moment before she says--
86) 5) dialog: There’s no such word as verticality.
86) 7) dialog: In the book, on page 217. When you lose the game in LA and come to New York you admire the city’s verticality.
86) 9) dialog: I don’t think so. Once you’re in New York you talk about games that lasted all night, two nights, being up for days but you don’t mention drugs.
86) 14) dialog: You left the drugs out of the book.
86) 16) dialog: Well so far you’re not paying me anything.
86) 18) dialog: What’s an advance on a book like this?
86) 20) dialog: Yeah.
86) 40) dialog: How did you meet the Playmates?
86) 42) dialog: How did you have occasion to be on a private jet to Vegas with Playboy Playmates?
86) 45) dialog: The first thing I’m gonna do is get you a minor role reduction, get the 12 points knocked down to 10.
86) 47) dialog: I’m gonna argue to the prosecutor that you didn’t play a leadership role. That you were an employee who was hired and fired by the players.
86) 49) dialog: I think we’ve got a good chance.
86) 51) dialog: Why not?
86) 53) dialog: Let me explain how the point system works.
86) 55) dialog: You really think this is a good time to hog credit?
86) 57) dialog: There was already a game at the Viper Room when you came along.
86) 60) dialog: I wasn’t really listening.
86) 62) dialog: I’m not caring.
86) 64) dialog: Do you want kids? Are you interested in having a family?
86) 66) dialog: I don’t get some point reductions and the sentencing recommendation guidelines say 8 to 12 years, Molly. That’s before they try to jam you up more with money laundering.
86) 68) dialog: The moment you changed the Russians’ money for chips.
86) 70) dialog: Find me twelve men and women who'll believe you weren’t aware of exactly who was sitting at your table and where their money came from. (pause) (MORE )
86) 72) dialog: So that’s that. You were a cocktail waitress.
117) 7) dialog: I wish I had better news.
117) 9) dialog: 
117) 11) dialog: 
117) 13) dialog: Hey, I tried. That’s what you’re not paying me to do.
117) 15) dialog: The Government is expressing an interest in you as a cooperating witness.
117) 17) dialog: Molly--
117) 19) dialog: Let’s have the conversation. in
117) 22) dialog: You don’t know anything that can help them convict the Russians but you know things that can help them.
117) 24) dialog: If you want to go to trial that’s fine but it’s gonna cost in the area of three and a half million dollars.
117) 26) dialog: If you’re saying that everything that happens in a federal bust from the moment you’re arrested is designed to persuade you to plead guilty, you’re correct.
117) 28) dialog: (beat) None of that-- 137.
117) 33) dialog: Good to get that off your chest?
117) 35) dialog: Not really. So to be clear, you're not interested in entering into a cooperation agreement with the prosectors.
117) 37) dialog: Because you feel the Government has acted--
117) 39) dialog: Which is nonetheless value to the prosecution so what we do is leverage it to get you a favorable sentencing recommendation or, better yet, complete immunity. * There’s a KNOCK on the door-- * CHARLIE (CONT’D) * (shouting) * Come in! * It’s STELLA, Charlie’s daughter whom we met earlier. * Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 139. CHARLIE (CONT’D) Oh hey honey.
117) 44) dialog: Two paragraphs.
117) 48) dialog: (while reading) Things with one-word titles.
117) 50) dialog: (still reading) Hang on. And yes.
117) 52) dialog: And then when you discover she doesn’t have a home you can come back to me. (MORE )
117) 55) dialog: (to STELLA) Good job. Why don’t you get a snack and start your homework in one of the conference rooms.
117) 58) dialog: There is a law that says that, it’s the first thing I taught her to read. (to STELLA) Go. STELLA exits.
117) 60) dialog: Where is your father in all this?
117) 62) dialog: Are your parents still together?
117) 64) dialog: Are you and your father close?
117) 66) dialog: Was he hard on you? ee OK ee Oe Oe OF Ht HF He OF
117) 69) dialog: All of them?

117) 78) text: He OK Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 142. We see MOLLY standing in the doorway hearing this, unseen her MOTHER. * INT. CHARLIE’S OFFICE - DAY *
117) 80) dialog: Yes.
117) 82) dialog: Molly--
138) 0) text: MOLLY and CHARLIE are sitting across a table from HARRISO WELLSTONE and BRENNAN, two prosecutors in their 30’s.
138) 2) dialog: She flew to Denver where her mother picked her up and drove them both to her mother’s home in Keystone. That was two years ago. It’s been two years since Ms. Bloom ran a game. I want to mention as well that two days after arriving in Keystone she voluntarily checked herself into a 28-day rehab and has been clean and sober for two years.
141) 1) dialog: And during the two years she lived with her mother in Keystone she wrote the book you have there. Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 166.
141) 7) dialog: No
141) 9) dialog: I meant no, she’s not answering that question. The purpose of this meeting-—-
141) 11) dialog: The purpose of the meeting--
141) 13) dialog: No we’re not.
141) 15) dialog: Yes, we are off the record inasmuch as there’s no record but you’re free to act on information that you’re given and we’re not giving it to you for free. I’ve been sitting at this table for five hours, waiting for the opportunity to implore you to do the right thing while begging my client for the last three weeks to act in her own best interest. And neither of those things should be hard. (pause) (MORE )
141) 17) dialog: The purpose of this meeting is for you to meet Molly Bloom and discover, as I have, that she’s not the person the press has invented.
141) 43) dialog: Shit. My office was next to yours for two years and I saw you make some bone-headed moves but I’ve never seen any prosecutor step in it the way you just did. You should thank all of the gods that there’s no physical record of that exchange.
141) 45) dialog: No you look, Harry--
141) 47) dialog: (shouting) You caught a dolphin in a tuna net and you know it! The rage that’s been building up in CHARLIE for hours if weeks--maybe years--has finally exploded.
141) 48) dialog: (beat) Molly Bloom does not belong ina RICO indictment, are you outta your minds?! She does not belong in a mob indictment, she raked a game, that’s it, for seven months two years ago. Why? Because she was giving credit in the millions and she didn’t want to use muscle to collect. (MORE )
141) 50) dialog: (pause) She’s had opportunity after opportunity to greatly benefit herself by simply telling the real stories she knows. I have the forensic imaging going back to 2007- -text messages, emails--movie stars, rock stars and billionaires who were explicit--some of them married with kids--but that’s the tip of the iceberg. A guy comes this close to being named U.S. Ambassador to Monaco, he’s withdrawn from consideration at the last minute and nobody knows why. She does. CEOs with college-age mistresses, an SVP of an investment bank who wanted her to help him put a marked deck in the game, the head of a movie studio who texted her that a particular star was too black for his taste, J. Edgar Hoover didn’t have this much shit on Bobby! (beat) She could’ve written a best seller, she could have been set for life, she’s got the winning lottery ticket and she won’t cash it. She settled the Brad Marion suit for a half a million dollars just so she wouldn’t have to testify and that was only the first time you guys cleaned her out. Your office took every dollar she had ina Constitutionally fucked up seizure and then you put the IRS on her to tax the money you seized? I’ve been in those strategy meetings. You broke her back so she couldn’t possibly afford to defend herself. And now she has an opportunity to guarantee her own freedom by just...“providing some color”...and she still won’t do it. This woman doesn’t belong in a RICO indictment, she belongs in Congress. She belongs in the pulpit of a synagogue, she belongs on a box of Wheaties. So yes I am, I’m imploring you to do the right thing. She knows nothing about the three Mikes. She knows nothing about Taiwanchik or the TGO or insurance fraud. (MORE )
141) 54) dialog: Between the two of us we’ve appeared in front of this judge 28 times as prosecutors and not once has he deviated from our sentencing recommendations, he’s not gonna start now. I know you’ve been putting this bust together for three years and there’s no one who doesn’t want to see mobsters in jail, including and especially the only person in this room who’s had one of them put a gun in her mouth. Probation. Community service. Or better yet, consider that all she did was run a poker game exactly the same way every casino in America does and drop the goddamn charges. There’s silence after that long speech. Then HARRISON to turns to MOLLY--
141) 58) dialog: Can you get some dinner for an hour and then meet me back at the office?
150) 19) dialog: Why do you know these things?
150) 21) dialog: Molly, there’s a new offer on the table.
150) 23) dialog: We hand over our forensic imaging.
150) 25) dialog: We give them the forensic imaging of your texts and e-mails and in exchange--
150) 27) dialog: Your money back. (pause) They’1l return all of your money. MOLLY takes in that information...doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry and just says...
150) 30) dialog: I think they just wanted to buy an espresso machine.
150) 32) dialog: Yeah. Hey, for what it’s worth, if we were going to trial we’d have to hand over the forensic imaging in discovery.
150) 34) dialog: Sure. (pause) (MORE )
