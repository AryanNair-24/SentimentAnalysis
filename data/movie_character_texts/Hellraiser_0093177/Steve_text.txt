This is the centre-piece of a table reduced to a battlefield by the guests who are laughing off-screen. We pass along the table, taking in dirty plates and cutlery, napkins, glasses and emptied wine bottles. Finally, we reach JULIA, who is still sitting at the table, while the others have retired to more comfortable seats.  She looks utterly miserable, and a little drunk. The room has been spruced up for the party.  Candles are burning on tables and mantelpiece, there are pictures on the walls.  But this is essentially cosmetic.  The place has not been refurnished or re- decorated. We move to the party guests.  Two, we recognize: KIRSTY, and LARRY - who is presently entertaining the gathering with an account of his accident.  The others are new faces.  An American couple:  BILL UNDERWOOD and his wife EVELYN, who are of an age with LARRY, and a younger, bespectacled man - a work colleague of LARRY's - STEVE O'DONNELL.  All are drunk. A brandy bottle sits on the table between them, and half a dozen other liquer bottles besides.  STEVE, it soon becomes apparent, has his eyes on KIRSTY. LARRY is half-way through his hospital story, gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale, much to the pleasure of the rest.  His hand and lower arm are heavily bandaged.

STEVE's hand moves to the place; he makes a small sound of pain. The CENOBITE takes off its glasses, to see its trick better.  The eyes beneath are sewn shut.  It pulls a little more on the hoo STEVE winces.

FRANK swipes at STEVE, who falls backwards down the stairs.   He cries out, head hitting the stairs as he descends. The box falls from his unconscious hand. FRANK turns on KIRSTY, who avoids one slice of the knife, and another, but is driven back into the Torture Room.

1) 301) text: Jesus Christ. They start down to the half-landing.  There stands the CENOBITE in the dark-glasses, carrying the hooked rod he threatened STEVE with in the hospital.  Again, KIRSTY manipulates the box.  Again, the CENOBITE howls and is claimed by the darkness.
1) 306) dialog: Come on!   Come on! THE ENGINEER crawls towards them.  Up above, the din of the roof collapsing.  Timbers and dust hurtle down the stairs.
1) 308) text: The same vortex that seized the other CENOBITE seizes THE ENGINEER.   Howling its complaint, it is drawn out into the darkness beyond the door, and disappears. Its voice grows thin, and fades. Finally, silence. The house is still. KIRSTY gets to her feet.  STEVE does the same. Together, they move to the door, and out onto the step.
