0) 12) dialog: Ah! The key is turned.
0) 13) dialog: Success. The door swings open. Voila! We see the pair on the doorstep.  LARRY is an American in his early forties, an attractive man who has lost his edge in recent years.  He looks harassed; he smirks too much.  A little, but significant, corner of him is utterly defeated.  JULIA, his wife, is English: and looks perhaps ten years his junior.  She is beautiful, but her face betrays a barely buried unhappiness.  Life has disappointed her too, of late: and LARRY has been a major part of their disappointment.
0) 14) dialog: Well.  This is it. They step over the threshold.
0) 17) dialog: It's just been empty a while.
0) 20) dialog: (from below)
0) 24) dialog: The best part of ten years. LARRY picks up some mail - circulars mostly - from behind the door, then leads JULIA through from the hallway to explore the ground floor.
0) 25) dialog: I wanted to sell it off at one point, after the old Lady died, but I couldn't get Frank to agree. He opens one of the doors, and looks inside.
0) 26) dialog: (with pleasure)
0) 28) dialog: Look at this. JULIA lingers in the doorway.
0) 30) dialog: (dismissively)
0) 33) dialog: (shrugs)
0) 36) dialog: He won't complain.  He can pay off some of his creditors. LARRY is getting more enthusiastic about the place by the moment.  He leaves the room, moving past JULIA to explore further.
0) 37) dialog: You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it.  She'll love it.
0) 39) dialog: You don't like it? JULIA shrugs.
0) 41) dialog: You're still blaming me.
0) 43) dialog: You wanted to come back to London.  We came back. We are hearing the tip of a debate they've had dozens of times, which immediately annoys them both.
0) 45) dialog: So what's the argument?
0) 48) dialog: Oh Christ.  Julia ... JULIA wanders back to the bottom of the stairs.  Then starts to climb.
0) 49) dialog: (exasperated, to himself)
0) 55) dialog: I hear you. He starts up the stairs.
0) 57) dialog: Where are you?
0) 59) text: In here. LARRY follows JULIA's voice to the end of the corridor. JULIA is standing in a doorway.  Beyond, the 'bedroom' we saw in the titles sequence, untouched since then.
0) 61) dialog: Frank. At the door, we see JULIA almost flinch at the name.
0) 63) dialog: He's been here.  There's stuff in the kitchen.  He must have made a hasty exit. The 'phone rings downstairs.  JULIA jumps. That'll be Kirsty. LARRY stands up and leaves the room, moving past JULIA in the doorway, who is left to stare down at the bed FRANK has slept in, and the suitcase of belongings. As we hear LARRY clatter downstairs it seems JULIA's face is close to tears.
0) 65) dialog: Hello ...? There's no answer. Hello ...?
0) 68) dialog: (on'phone)
0) 71) dialog: (from below)
0) 74) dialog: I'm surprised it's even connected ... The 'phone rings again. Shit.

0) 103) dialog: Well come over, will you? See the place?

0) 118) dialog: Just take it slowly.
0) 121) dialog: It'll go in.
0) 124) dialog: (not seeing Julia)
0) 127) text: Do you really need this bed, lady? LARRY turns.  Sees JULIA.
0) 128) dialog: How are you doing through there?
0) 132) dialog: I'll get it. LARRY disappears through into the kitchen.  JULIA starts up the stairs, watched appreciatively by the two men in the doorway.  One leans over and whispers to the other, who laughs.  JULIA glances back at them. The whisperer licks his lips; the meaning of the gesture perfectly apparent.  JULIA heads upstairs.
0) 142) dialog: Honey! They hug each other.
0) 144) dialog: You like?
0) 146) dialog: I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
0) 148) dialog: Upstairs. (his voice lowers)
0) 152) dialog: (a gently chiding voice)
0) 155) dialog: Kitchen's through on your left KIRSTY kisses LARRY, and goes through to the kitchen. LARRY turns back to the door.  The men have been watching KIRSTY.  LARRY clearly dislikes the scrutiny. 1ST MAN, out-stared by LARRY, looks away.  The 2ND MAN is unperturbed.
0) 157) dialog: Uh-huh.
0) 160) dialog: Her mother's dead. 2ND MAN's grin fades.
0) 162) dialog: Julia's my second wife.
0) 165) dialog: Damn right.  Now are we going to move the bed or not?
0) 175) dialog: (calls through)
0) 210) dialog: Wait!  Wait! The light through the window falls on her eye. The screen becomes a white-out, from which emerges:

0) 232) dialog: Christ!
0) 234) dialog: My fucking hand! He drops his edge of the bed, and disengages his hand from the nail upon which he's injured himself.  He lifts his hand, from which blood is pouring.
0) 235) dialog: You fucking ass-holes.
0) 237) dialog: ... Oh Christ ... But not in front of these bastards.  He turns and starts up the stairs, groggier by the moment.
0) 238) dialog: ... oh ... Christ ...
0) 251) dialog: (weakly)
0) 255) dialog: I cut myself. Blood has started to drip, unnoticed by either of them, onto the bare boards.  Heavy splashes. LARRY looks sick; his face clammy with sweat.  She stares at him without a trace of feeling for him on her face.
0) 257) dialog: I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
0) 259) dialog: (he leans againts the wall)
0) 263) dialog: I'm going to throw up.
0) 266) dialog: So damn stupid.
0) 268) dialog: I'll be scarred for life.
0) 280) text: the remains of a rack of lamb, its gravy now congealed, scraps of meat adhering to the bone here and there. This is the centre-piece of a table reduced to a battlefield by the guests who are laughing off-screen. We pass along the table, taking in dirty plates and cutlery, napkins, glasses and emptied wine bottles. Finally, we reach JULIA, who is still sitting at the table, while the others have retired to more comfortable seats.  She looks utterly miserable, and a little drunk. The room has been spruced up for the party.  Candles are burning on tables and mantelpiece, there are pictures on the walls.  But this is essentially cosmetic.  The place has not been refurnished or re- decorated. We move to the party guests.  Two, we recognize: KIRSTY, and LARRY - who is presently entertaining the gathering with an account of his accident.  The others are new faces.  An American couple:  BILL UNDERWOOD and his wife EVELYN, who are of an age with LARRY, and a younger, bespectacled man - a work colleague of LARRY's - STEVE O'DONNELL.  All are drunk. A brandy bottle sits on the table between them, and half a dozen other liquer bottles besides.  STEVE, it soon becomes apparent, has his eyes on KIRSTY. LARRY is half-way through his hospital story, gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale, much to the pleasure of the rest.  His hand and lower arm are heavily bandaged.
0) 281) dialog: - always hated the sight of my own blood.  I go out like a light. Anybody else's?  no problem.  But mine ... you know ... goes straight to my head.  Anyhow, this damn doctor's poking around and I'm saying: I'm going to pass out, and he's saying, no you're not, no you're not.  Next thing I know - We
0) 283) dialog: - I wake up On the floor. Gales of laughter at this. And it was HIM who was looking sick.
0) 285) dialog: I should do it!
0) 287) dialog: I know.  And he's saying: I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
0) 289) dialog: Right ... (he has picked up the brandy bottle)
0) 293) dialog: Come on, you're only young once - LARRY fills up her glass.
0) 294) dialog: (to Kirsty)
0) 298) dialog: Steve?
0) 305) dialog: Are you O.K.? JULIA nods.
0) 308) dialog: Bill?  Absolutely not.  Sit down.  We've got celebrating to do. JULIA looks frosty, but LARRY does not catch the look. KIRSTY does however.  BILL sits down.
0) 318) text: That's nice.  Well ... goodnight. She exits, to a chorus of goodnights.  KIRSTY in particular watches her as she makes her exit.  JULIA's behaviour confounds her.  Meanwhile, the conversation has returned to LARRY's 'wound'.
0) 320) dialog: Only when I laugh. This wins another round of laughter.

0) 501) dialog: (quietly)
0) 504) dialog: Are you there? He starts up.
0) 506) dialog: Julia?
0) 509) dialog: (at the door)

0) 515) dialog: Can I get you anything?
0) 517) dialog: Sure.
0) 519) dialog: 
0) 531) dialog: Julia?   Are you all right? JULIA crosses to the door and calls down.
0) 533) dialog: 
0) 550) dialog: I'm O.K., honey.  It's all right ...
0) 554) dialog: Never better.  You sleep well. KIRSTY (on phone)
0) 556) dialog: I love you, honey. KIRSTY (on phone)
0) 557) text: I love you too. LARRY puts down the phone.
0) 560) dialog: Kirsty. He goes into the bedroom. We PAN up the second flight of stairs. FRANK is sitting at the top, in the shadows.
0) 592) dialog: Is this upsetting you?
0) 594) dialog: Are you all right?
0) 596) dialog: Only I'll turn it off - There's a sudden raising of shouts from the screen, as one of the boxers hits the canvas.  LARRY turns his attention back to the match.
0) 601) dialog: What was that? JULIA looks up from her magazine.
0) 603) dialog: No.  Something else. LARRY stands up.
0) 605) dialog: No.  I'll do it. He opens the door, and steps out into the hallway.
0) 609) dialog: What's wrong with you? She's desperate to stop him climbing to the Torture Room.
0) 611) dialog: I'm here. He puts his arms around her.  She responds. You're shaking. He hugs her tight, kissing her lightly. The thunder shakes the house. There's nothing to be afraid of. He kisses her neck, his hands restless on her. I'll just go check upstairs ... He kisses her again.  She, in order to distract him, kisses him back.  Her passion is artificial, but he doesn't register that.
0) 612) dialog: Oh baby.
0) 614) dialog: Come with me then. He starts up the stairs.
0) 618) dialog: We must have rats. She looks back down the stairs.  Where's FRANK gone? LARRY turns to her, holding her again, on the threshold of the Torture Room.
0) 619) dialog: See?  Quite safe. He kisses her, much harder this time; a sexual kiss. Let's go  down.  I'll make it better. He kisses her again.
0) 621) dialog: ... oh babe ... He starts to unbutton her dress.  She's distracted by her suspicions; he has his hands against her almost before she realizes what's happening. We have her P.O.V. as she looks around the room.  The dressing table; the wardrobe; the curtains at the window.  Does something move in the shadows? A flash of lightning.  No.  There's nothing. LARRY gets onto the bed and draws her against him, kissing her.  This is not the intense, slightly dangerous love-making she experienced with FRANK, but a fumbling, slightly foolish exchange.  LARRY is so wrapped in attempting to make the right moves he doesn't register the fact that JULIA's attention is elsewhere. Now we have a P.O.V. from the far side of the room, of the two figures on the bed, the only sound the thunder and LARRY's murmured words of seduction, which we can barely make out.
0) 622) dialog: ...I love you, honey ... let me ... oh God ... I love you ... Neither of them have undressed fully; there's just a tangle of clothes around them which removes any trace of eroticism from the scene. A CLOSE UP of JULIA's head, laid on the pillow, shows just how uninvolved she is - while LARRY works, eyes closed.  JULIA looks down the length of her husband's body.  The door of the wardrobe swings open.  FRANK is watching.  She registers horror.  LARRY is oblivious to all of this, of course. We have a CLOSE UP of FRANK watching the love-making. Now he steps out of the wardrobe.  JULIA makes a moan of horror, which LARRY takes as enthusiasm.
0) 623) dialog: Oh baby ... I love you ... From JULIA'S P.O.V., we see the form of FRANK shamble towards the lovers. From FRANK'S P.O.V. we see the lovers on the bed, LARRY's back vunerable.  JULIA seems to realize what he intends.
0) 626) dialog: (looks at her)
0) 629) dialog: What's wrong with you?
0) 631) text: Please.  I can't bear it ... LARRY is angered and utterly perplexed at this.  He disengages his arms from around her. JULIA'S P.O.V., as FRANK retreats. LARRY rolls off JULIA. The wardrobe door closes.  Click.
0) 632) dialog: I don't understand you.  One moment you're all over me, the next it's:  Don't touch me. He sits on the edge of the bed. I just don't understand. He gets up and leaves the bedroom.  JULIA remains where she is.  We have a shot of the bed, and her upon it, from FRANK's end of the room.  She stares at the wardrobe.  Through the crack of the open door, FRANK stares back.  A flicker of lightning illuminates his face; his skeletal grin. Softly, beneath the assault of the rain on the roof, we hear laughter.
0) 634) dialog: ... maybe we should never have come back.
0) 636) dialog: I guess.
0) 639) dialog: You don't like her at all do you? The straight-forward question silences KIRSTY for a moment.  She wants to be delicate with her father's feelings, but honest at the same time.
0) 641) dialog: She doesn't even want to leave the house.
0) 643) dialog: It's like she's waiting for something.
0) 645) dialog: I don't know.  I don't know. It's beyond me. A silence.
0) 646) dialog: (hesitant)
0) 649) dialog: Maybe all she needs is some company.
1) 108) dialog: (inside)
1) 111) dialog: What's wrong?
1) 113) dialog: What are you talking about?
1) 207) text: I thought something might have ... She glances round at JULIA, who has also entered. (to Larry)
1) 209) dialog: Of course. LARRY leans forward, and into the pool of light over the table.  He looks much the worse for wear.  His flesh is raw and bruised.  There is blood at his neck and hairline.
1) 210) dialog: It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right ...
1) 212) dialog: Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
1) 214) dialog: (smiles)
1) 218) dialog: He was insane, baby:  a mad dog. I put him out of his misery - KIRSTY stares at LARRY, while in her head she hears the CENOBITE's voice.
1) 220) dialog: I'll go to the police, when I'm feeling stronger.  Try and find some way to make them understand, though God knows I don't really understand myself.  Did he hurt you? KIRSTY is dumb with horror at her situation.
1) 221) dialog: (leans back)
1) 224) dialog: I'm afraid it's true.
1) 227) dialog: No you don't.
1) 229) dialog: (to Julia)
1) 230) text: Show her. KIRSTY turns away from LARRY.  JULIA leads her out into the Hallway.
1) 237) dialog: Where are you going?
1) 239) dialog: Stay with me - JULIA is on the stairs, watching this exchange.
1) 240) dialog: - it's all right.   Really it is ... He touches her face, fondly.
1) 242) dialog: Come to Daddy. She hesitates at the door, and turns.
1) 244) dialog: Come to Daddy. Her gaze moves up to JULIA, who is on the stairs.
1) 248) text: Oh my God. Everything is slowing down.  The bells and the thunder fill the soundtrack. LARRY smiles, as KIRSTY moves towards him.  Tears have begun to fill her eyes.   She searches for him.  His smile decays as he realizes her objective.   Her nails rake his cheek.   The flesh puckers, and tears along the brow.   Blood flows.   The mask of stolen flesh he wears slips a little, and FRANK's twisted features come into view.
