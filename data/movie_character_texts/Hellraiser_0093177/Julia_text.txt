0) 23) dialog: How long since you were here?
0) 29) dialog: Why didn't he want to sell it?
0) 31) text: I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway. He pulls a sheet off a chair. Look at this stuff. The chair is ugly; old fashioned.  JULIA is unimpressed.
0) 32) dialog: Not exactly modern.
0) 35) dialog: I thought half of it was your brother's?
0) 38) dialog: You mean we're moving in? LARRY pauses.  Looks at her.
0) 40) dialog: It's better than Brooklyn. She turns back down the hallway. He watches her, then follows.
0) 42) dialog: No.  I'm not.
0) 44) dialog: All right.
0) 46) dialog: (cold)
0) 54) dialog: Larry! He leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the bottom of the stairs. Larry!
0) 58) dialog: (out of sight)
0) 59) text: In here. LARRY follows JULIA's voice to the end of the corridor. JULIA is standing in a doorway.  Beyond, the 'bedroom' we saw in the titles sequence, untouched since then.
0) 60) dialog: Squatters? LARRY steps past her, and throws back the blankets. Wood-lice scurry away.  He goes to the suitcase, and starts looking through it.  Besides clothes there's a lot else that speaks of its owner: bric-a-brac picked up in a lifetime of adventuring; handful of bullets; Fragments of an erotic statue; coins and notes from a dozen countries.  Amongst the stuff, some photographs. LARRY peers at them.  One pictures a good-looking intense man in his mid to late thirties, in bed with a naked Chinese girl.
0) 62) dialog: He's here?
0) 109) dialog: (resigned)
0) 127) text: Do you really need this bed, lady? LARRY turns.  Sees JULIA.
0) 129) dialog: It looks like a bomb's dropped.
0) 131) dialog: There's some in the 'fridge. Nobody moves to get it.  Certainly JULIA has no intention of being waitress.  She goes to the bottom of the stairs.
0) 183) dialog: That's right.  Who are you?
0) 186) dialog: (smiles)
0) 189) dialog: Oh.  Oh yes.
0) 191) dialog: I'm sorry.  Of course.  You're very welcome. He steps inside.  Now he is close to her, rain running down his face.  We can hear his breath; sense the almost intimidating intimacy of his presence.
0) 196) dialog: Kirsty.
0) 198) dialog: There's a towel in the bath- room.
0) 200) dialog: Just to your left. KIRSTY ducks into the bathroom.  We

0) 225) dialog: Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh my God. The scene whites out.

0) 252) text: ... Julia ...
0) 254) dialog: What have you done?
0) 256) dialog: Is it deep?
0) 258) dialog: You're NOT going to faint.
0) 261) dialog: Let me see. She goes to him.  He looks away as she unglues one hand from the other, and looks at the wound.  Blood comes fast hitting the floor between them.
0) 262) dialog: It's probably going to need stitches.
0) 264) dialog: No, you're not. The blood keeps hitting the floor.  Slap; slap; slap. We'll get you out into the fresh air. He is again clamping his hand over the wound, as JULIA helps him to the door.  They leave the Torture Room. We hear their voices receding down the passageway, as we again assume that hovering view point.  The floor, is heavily spattered with blood.
0) 265) dialog: Take it slowly.
0) 267) dialog: You're done worse.
0) 269) dialog: No you won't.
0) 272) dialog: Just an accident.  He's all right.  Will you drive?  He needs stitches.
0) 274) dialog: The keys are in the kitchen. KIRSTY heads back to the kitchen.  JULIA helps LARRY towards the front door. The CAMERA swings away from them, upstairs, and begins to track ...
0) 280) text: the remains of a rack of lamb, its gravy now congealed, scraps of meat adhering to the bone here and there. This is the centre-piece of a table reduced to a battlefield by the guests who are laughing off-screen. We pass along the table, taking in dirty plates and cutlery, napkins, glasses and emptied wine bottles. Finally, we reach JULIA, who is still sitting at the table, while the others have retired to more comfortable seats.  She looks utterly miserable, and a little drunk. The room has been spruced up for the party.  Candles are burning on tables and mantelpiece, there are pictures on the walls.  But this is essentially cosmetic.  The place has not been refurnished or re- decorated. We move to the party guests.  Two, we recognize: KIRSTY, and LARRY - who is presently entertaining the gathering with an account of his accident.  The others are new faces.  An American couple:  BILL UNDERWOOD and his wife EVELYN, who are of an age with LARRY, and a younger, bespectacled man - a work colleague of LARRY's - STEVE O'DONNELL.  All are drunk. A brandy bottle sits on the table between them, and half a dozen other liquer bottles besides.  STEVE, it soon becomes apparent, has his eyes on KIRSTY. LARRY is half-way through his hospital story, gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale, much to the pleasure of the rest.  His hand and lower arm are heavily bandaged.
0) 304) dialog: Would you excuse me?  I think I'm going to go to bed.
0) 312) text: Oh it was.  It was wonderful. There's a chorus of approval.  JULIA puts a smile on.
0) 313) dialog: I'm glad you enjoyed it.
0) 317) dialog: (at the door)
0) 318) text: That's nice.  Well ... goodnight. She exits, to a chorus of goodnights.  KIRSTY in particular watches her as she makes her exit.  JULIA's behaviour confounds her.  Meanwhile, the conversation has returned to LARRY's 'wound'.
0) 324) dialog: Who's there? On the far side of the room, a movement in the shadows. JULIA almost retreats, but something keeps her staring into the murk, as SOMETHING - the remnants of a human form made of twisted, blistered strands of flesh, raises its head.  It's squatting against the wall, unable to lift itself into a standing position.  Its eyes, however, have life in them: and hunger. This, though he's unrecognizable, is FRANK.
0) 326) text: Julia.
0) 327) dialog: Oh my God.
0) 329) dialog: Who are you?
0) 331) dialog: Tell me who you are.
0) 333) dialog: No.  God no.
0) 335) dialog: What happened to you?
0) 337) dialog: Back from where?
0) 351) dialog: Ssh! The sound of KIRSTY downstairs, closing the bathroom door.
0) 353) dialog: What do you want me to do.
0) 367) text: I'm coming! (to Julia)
0) 368) text: Sleep well. JULIA is left on the landing, as KIRSTY heads downstairs.
0) 400) dialog: Yes.
0) 421) dialog: What?
0) 423) dialog: Not much.
0) 425) dialog: Why not? She smiles.   The smile works wonders.  PRUDHOE's nerves diminish somewhat.  JULIA's simply increase, now that she's committed herself.  Again, she opens the pack of cigarettes, as PRUDHOE calls the BARMAN over.
0) 428) dialog: Just soda.
0) 430) dialog: Please.
0) 432) text: One soda, one whisky. (to Julia)
0) 434) dialog: (looking straight at him)
0) 441) dialog: There's a first time for every- thing.
0) 443) dialog: You want something to drink?
0) 447) dialog: Yes.  I just think we'd be better off upstairs.
0) 451) dialog: Let's not talk about it.
0) 453) dialog: Right.
0) 455) dialog: Come on in.  Make yourself at home. She steps inside.  PRUDHOE does as he's instructed.  He stares at the bare floor, as JULIA closes the door behind him.
0) 457) dialog: That's right.
0) 459) dialog: I prefer the floor.
0) 461) dialog: Right. JULIA moves towards him
0) 462) dialog: Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
0) 466) dialog: Maybe I will. PRUDHOE, now starts to shed his jacket and trousers, tryi not to take his eyes off JULIA for an instant. We watch from FRANK'S P.O.V. as he drops his underwear. He still wears his shirt, which he starts to unbutton. We move back into a tighter shot.
0) 469) dialog: Am I?
0) 472) dialog: What's wrong?
0) 477) dialog: Enough? The room sighs.   In the corner, FRANK's shadowy form leans forward.
0) 483) dialog: Jesus Christ. JULIA looks across at FRANK, who is no longer sitting, but standing in the shadows.
0) 490) text: Sweetheart? JULIA withdraws from his touch
0) 502) text: Julia? He leaves the kitchen.
0) 507) dialog: (from bathroom)
0) 511) dialog: Just feeling a bit sick.
0) 514) dialog: I'll be O.K.  Just leave me be a while.
0) 516) dialog: Maybe a brandy.
0) 518) dialog: I'll be down in a minute
0) 522) dialog: (very softly)
0) 525) dialog: Hurting.
0) 527) dialog: Good.
0) 529) dialog: Who?
0) 532) dialog: Just a moment.  Put on some music will you babe?
0) 536) dialog: Keep your voice down. She crosses to close the door.   When she turns round, he's in front of her, silhouetted against the window, his half-formed face terrifying in the gloom.  Suddenly he reaches out and catches hold of her arm.  She gasps in pain.
0) 538) dialog: You're hurting.
0) 559) dialog: Who was it?
0) 565) dialog: Quite sure.
0) 571) dialog: Well?
0) 573) dialog: Then you tell me ... you explain what happened to you?
0) 577) dialog: The Cenobites.
0) 579) dialog: And the box? FRANK picks up the box.  Vague, tantalizing forms move over the surface, like ghosts.
0) 581) dialog: Where from?
0) 583) dialog: So they cheated you In the lacquer we see oiled bodies moving.  It's difficult to be sure what the forms signify.  Is this torture, or some elaborate pleasure?
0) 587) dialog: And the blood let you out?
0) 590) dialog: You won't have to.  We'll be gone.  Somewhere they'll never find us. There's a rumble of thunder. Not in the whole wide world.
0) 593) dialog: I've seen worse. LARRY looks at her.
0) 595) dialog: Fine.
0) 602) dialog: Thunder. The violence on the screen is horrific, as swollen faces burst beneath punches.
0) 604) dialog: Maybe I left a window open - She gets up and crosses to the door. - I'll go see.
0) 608) dialog: It was nothing. LARRY has reached the top of the stairs.  He looks up the next flight. Larry ...
0) 610) dialog: I just hate the thunder. He crosses to her.
0) 613) dialog: Don't go upstairs.
0) 615) dialog: Please ...
0) 617) dialog: Don't. Lightning floods the room.  It's empty.  She stands beside him at the door.
0) 624) dialog: ... no ... LARRY barely hears her. FRANK is at the very end of the bed now, and JULIA becomes highly agitated.
0) 625) dialog: No.  No, you mustn't.  PLEASE. No. LARRY stops his love-making.
0) 628) dialog: Please ...
0) 630) dialog: (almost sobbing)
0) 631) text: Please.  I can't bear it ... LARRY is angered and utterly perplexed at this.  He disengages his arms from around her. JULIA'S P.O.V., as FRANK retreats. LARRY rolls off JULIA. The wardrobe door closes.  Click.
0) 652) dialog: I don't.
0) 654) dialog: I said no.
1) 7) dialog: Everybody does.
1) 10) dialog: Come in. The humming stops. JULIA opens the door.
1) 20) text: Don't! Casually, FRANK throws JULIA aside.  She falls, sobbing. FRANK descends on SYKES.
1) 27) text: Please ... don't let him kill me ... please ... JULIA leaves, closing the door. FRANK seizes hold of SYKE's neck, his fingers entering the flesh either side of his neck vertebrae.  SYKES screa
1) 38) text: Julia!
1) 88) dialog: She'll tell them everything ...
1) 90) dialog: That's probably her now.  Or the police.
1) 92) dialog: Don't you care?
1) 94) dialog: Maybe we should just leave -
1) 97) dialog: Well we can't just stay here -
1) 109) text: Julia?
1) 112) dialog: I don't know where to begin ...
1) 114) dialog: It's better you see for your- self - She turns and starts up the stairs.  He follows.
1) 190) dialog: Damn her. We hear a voice, off-screen.  Is it FRANK or LARRY? Impossible to be sure.
1) 194) dialog: Kirsty?   It's very late.
1) 196) dialog: What's the problem?
1) 199) dialog: Of course.  There's no need to shout.
1) 201) dialog: You look terrible.  Have you had an accident?
1) 203) dialog: This afternoon.
1) 205) dialog: I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see? KIRSTY doesn't answer, but walks through into the Dining Room.  KIRSTY sees LARRY at the table.
1) 207) text: I thought something might have ... She glances round at JULIA, who has also entered. (to Larry)
1) 217) dialog: Dead.
1) 230) text: Show her. KIRSTY turns away from LARRY.  JULIA leads her out into the Hallway.
1) 233) dialog: Where are you going? KIRSTY doesn't reply.  She merely hurries away.
1) 234) dialog: (calling after her)
1) 245) dialog: No, damn you -
1) 249) dialog: Frank! KIRSTY screams, as FRANK lunges for her.  The lights in the hallway flicker, and threaten to go out. KIRSTY avoids FRANK's blow, but in doing so allows him to get between her and the front door.  She's trapped. His torn face flapping, he opens his jacket (the interior of which is blood-stained) and pulls a knife from the lining. Suddenly, JULIA is behind her, gripping hold of her hair. FRANK advances on KIRSTY, but in the last moment before the fatal stab KIRSTY twists, avoiding the blow.  JULIA shrieks and stumbles forward, the knife gleaming as it's buried to the hilt in her side. KIRSTY slips from between them.  JULIA collapses into FRANK's arms.   He holds her up. KIRSTY makes a dive for the front door, but FRANK lets JULIA slip and intercepts KIRSTY.  JULIA falls back against the wall, dying.  KIRSTY retreats to the bottom of the stairs.  FRANK follows.
1) 251) dialog: Help me, Frank. For God's sake. He puts his hands around her neck, and leans towards her.  At the last moment she seems to understand that he intends not to kiss her but to steal what little life she has left.
1) 252) dialog: No, Frank - From the stairs KIRSTY glimpses him battering upon her. Then she looks away, and runs up the stairs. When we look back JULIA is withering in FRANK's arms.
1) 303) dialog: Kirsty ... KIRSTY hesitates, and looks towards the door of the dining room. There stands the bride, her white dress soaked in blood, her veil covering her face.
