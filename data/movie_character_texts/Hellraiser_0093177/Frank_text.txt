0) 185) text: I'm brother Frank.
0) 188) dialog: I came for the wedding. He looks at her, eyes glittering.  His hold on her is almost mesmeric. There is going to BE a wedding?
0) 190) dialog: Well can I come in or not?
0) 192) dialog: That's nice to know. (pause)
0) 213) dialog: I don't want to see the dress.
0) 215) dialog: I don't want to see the dress. JULIA lets the dress drop a few inches in front of her.  She stares at FRANK.
0) 216) dialog: You know what I want. Still she doesn't let the 'defence' that the dress offers - a reminder of her imminent marriage - fall. She stares though, and there's an invitation in her eyes.

0) 219) dialog: That's better FRANK steps towards her.
0) 221) dialog: Forget him. FRANK takes hold of her.  She doesn't resist him, though there is barely disguised fear on her face. He puts his hand inside her blouse.

0) 325) dialog: (a pained whisper)
0) 328) dialog: Don't look at me.
0) 330) dialog: I said: don't look. She looks away. Help me.
0) 332) dialog: Frank. JULIA's face registers horror and disbelief.
0) 334) dialog: Believe me.  It's me.  It's really me.
0) 336) dialog: His blood ... on the floor ... It brought me back.
0) 338) dialog: Just help, will you?  Please God, help me - From downstairs, dimly, laughter.
0) 350) dialog: ... somebody ...
0) 352) dialog: You can't let me stay like this. Please.  You can't.
0) 354) dialog: The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same.  Or I'll slip back ...
0) 356) dialog: (a plea)
0) 399) dialog: Well? JULIA stares at the thing moving in the shadow.
0) 478) dialog: Don't look at me. JULIA backs towards the door, as the broken, skeletal form crawls out of darkness to claim its sustenance.
0) 484) dialog: (his voice stronger)
0) 486) dialog: See?   It's making me whole again. He turns his arm over for her appreciation. Every drop of blood you spill puts more flesh on my bones. And we both want that don't we? She nods. Good.  Come here. She stares, unable to move. Come here, damn you.  I want to touch you ... Still she doesn't move.
0) 487) dialog: (more softly)
0) 498) dialog: Who's a pretty boy then? Soft laughter from the darkness.
0) 523) text: Frank? A crunching sound in the shadows.  FRANK's hand opens, dropping the pieces of PRUDHOE's dentures, which he has crushed, onto the floor, in a rain of plastic teeth.
0) 524) dialog: I'm hurting
0) 526) dialog: My nerves ... are beginning to work again.
0) 528) dialog: One more.  Maybe two - JULIA's face registers no horrer at this. - to heal me completely.   Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
0) 530) dialog: The Cenobites.  It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here. From downstairs, LARRY.
0) 535) dialog: Poor Larry.  Obedient as ever.
0) 537) dialog: Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
0) 539) dialog: You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me.  Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before.  We belong to each other now, for better or worse ... He lets go of her. ... like love.  Only real. She goes to the door, and leaves him, locking it behind her. We move close to FRANK's face.   He licks his skinned lips with a bloody tongue.  Thunder rolls.
0) 561) dialog: (soft as a breath)
0) 572) dialog: Better.  Much better.  I'd like some clothes.  And maybe a cigarette.
0) 574) dialog: Of course.
0) 576) dialog: I wanted access to experiences ... pleasures ... that only they could offer ...
0) 578) dialog: That's what they call themselves. They're not human.  Maybe they were once, but they're not now. They rearrange their own flesh for pleasure. We've moved across to FRANK now.  He is dressed, in loose fitting jacket and trousers, through which his blood is seeping.  He smokes, taking great pleasure in the experience.
0) 580) dialog: It cost me a fortune.  All I had.  It's a puzzle you see. You solve it, and the Cenobites come through ...
0) 582) dialog: God knows.  Sometimes I think they're just behind the walls ... He turns the box over.  The lacquer catches the light.
0) 584) dialog: Oh no.  They kept to their bargain.  They gave me experiences I'd never forget ... The images in the lacquer are becoming clearer, and they are APPALLING.  Flesh torn open; blood running across sweating flesh; hooks, and terrible machines.
0) 585) dialog: But their pleasure was my pain. His voice has begun to tremble.  The images in the box are more horrific by the moment.  And flowing between them, highly distorted, the CENOBITE's faces, and that of FRANK, screaming and screaming.
0) 586) dialog: Terrible pain.  Appalling ... He can't speak for a moment.  After a pause, he goes on, his voice heavy. My body was forfeit.  But my spirit ... they left that here. In the boards.  In the walls. Watching the world, but never able to touch it ...
0) 588) dialog: There are ways to resurrection. Blood's one of them.  I won't let them take me back, Julia. JULIA looks at the horrors in the box, and understands his desire.
0) 589) dialog: I want to be whole, and then get out - He lifts the box up. I won't let them take me.
0) 631) text: Please.  I can't bear it ... LARRY is angered and utterly perplexed at this.  He disengages his arms from around her. JULIA'S P.O.V., as FRANK retreats. LARRY rolls off JULIA. The wardrobe door closes.  Click.
0) 651) dialog: You can't love him.
0) 653) dialog: So where's the harm?
0) 655) dialog: Then find me somebody else,  before they come looking. JULIA nods. Tomorrow? She looks at him.
1) 20) text: Don't! Casually, FRANK throws JULIA aside.  She falls, sobbing. FRANK descends on SYKES.
1) 24) dialog: (to Julia)
1) 27) text: Please ... don't let him kill me ... please ... JULIA leaves, closing the door. FRANK seizes hold of SYKE's neck, his fingers entering the flesh either side of his neck vertebrae.  SYKES screa
1) 39) dialog: Kirsty? He takes a step towards her.
1) 41) dialog: Kirsty.  It's Frank.  It's Uncle Frank.
1) 43) dialog: You remember.
1) 45) dialog: Come to Daddy. Her puzzlement, however, has slowed her retreat,  and now FRANK reaches for her.  At the last moment she backs away again, but he's after her in a beat, and seizes hold of her.
1) 48) dialog: You've grown.  You're beautiful. She has retreated as far from him as she can get.  He advances on her.
1) 50) dialog: What?  What will you do?  What can you do? (pause)
1) 51) text: There's nothing to be frightened of. FRANK has closed in on her by now.  He Lakes hold of her face.
1) 52) dialog: I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you?  Beautiful.
1) 54) dialog: I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain.  But why kid yourself?  Some things have to be endured.  Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter ... As he leans in to kiss her she snatches hold of the pus and bloodstained shirt that's glued to his abdomen, and PULLS.  There's a flow of fluids. FRANK's head is thrown back, and he screams. She slips from beneath his grasp.  But he's after her in a moment, his hand catching her blouse.  It tears.  His fingers rake her bare skin. She stumbles, reaches out for the wall, which is slick with SYKES' blood.  Her hand slides over it.  She falls, heavily. Roaring, FRANK comes in pursuit of her. On the floor in front of KIRSTY:  the box.  It's a poor weapon, but it's all she's got.  As he comes after her again, she stands up and delivers a blow to his head with the box.  He howls.  She races for the door.  But he's after her.  He strikes her. She's thrown against the wall.  He's FURIOUS now. Strikes her again.  She cannot survive much more. She raises the box to retaliate.   FRANK sees what she's holding.  His  attack stops.
1) 55) dialog: Give that to me. She dimly realizes that she has a bargaining tool.
1) 58) dialog: One last time.  Give me the box.
1) 60) dialog: 
1) 70) dialog: Come to Daddy.
1) 72) dialog: Some things have to be endured ... The darkness is filling the screen ... take it from me ... Now, total darkness. ... Come to Daddy ... And suddenly, she wakes.
1) 89) dialog: I don't think so.  She'll want Larry first.
1) 91) dialog: Maybe.
1) 93) dialog: There's very little I can do about it.
1) 95) dialog: Like this?  Look at me! LIKE
1) 98) dialog: I need a skin.  Then we leave -
1) 222) text: Poor Frank.  He's better off dead.
1) 248) text: Oh my God. Everything is slowing down.  The bells and the thunder fill the soundtrack. LARRY smiles, as KIRSTY moves towards him.  Tears have begun to fill her eyes.   She searches for him.  His smile decays as he realizes her objective.   Her nails rake his cheek.   The flesh puckers, and tears along the brow.   Blood flows.   The mask of stolen flesh he wears slips a little, and FRANK's twisted features come into view.
1) 250) dialog: You're not leaving now - As he follows, JULIA reaches out and takes hold of his sleeve. KIRSTY flees the only route she can, upstairs.  The house is creaking in every board and rafter now. FRANK turns on JULIA, trapping her against the wall.,
1) 257) dialog: Where are you, beautiful? KIRSTY starts up the second flight of stairs, as FRANK's shadow is thrown up on the wall below.
1) 260) dialog: (somewhere below)
1) 263) dialog: Come to Daddy.
1) 271) text: I'll go first - As he speaks, FRANK steps out of the Torture Room, knife in hand. Roaring, he comes at them both.  KIRSTY flings herself out of the path of the knife.  FRANK swipes at STEVE, who falls backwards down the stairs.   He cries out, head hitting the stairs as he descends. The box falls from his unconscious hand. FRANK turns on KIRSTY, who avoids one slice of the knife, and another, but is driven back into the Torture Room.
1) 274) dialog: Don't cry for him.  He's dead. He always was. KIRSTY has been pushed to the limits of her endurance. She can be terrorized and pursued no longer.  Death looks an easy option by comparison with more of FRANK's horrors.
1) 276) dialog: Poor baby.
1) 278) dialog: Hush now.   It's all right. Frank's here.
1) 280) dialog: That's right.  Are you losing your mind, baby?  This is Frank you're talking to.  FRANK. As he speaks the bell begins tolling again.  FRANK looks puzzled.
1) 281) dialog: What's going on? Light begins to pour through the walls of the room. No. He starts towards the door.  But he's too late.  The CENOBITES are standing in his way.  He backs off from them.
1) 286) dialog: You set me up!   You bitch. You set me up! The pattern of light in the room has become more elaborat and the CENOBITES move through it towards FRANK.
1) 288) text: This isn't for your eyes. KIRSTY crosses towards the door.  As she reaches for the handle she hears FRANK roar behind her.  She turns.   He breaks between the CENOBITES, knife in hand, but as he comes within striking distance the air is full of whining sounds and he stops dead. They have their hooks in him, we see.  In his arms and legs;  in his back and sides;  in his scalp and neck and temples.   Hooks attached to countless chains, which arrest his progress.  They plough through his flesh as he strives to reach her.  But at a gesture from the leade of the CENOBITES, the chains are hauled in.  He flings back his head, yelling.   The knife drops from his hand.
1) 290) text: Out! She turns back to the door and opens it.  FRANK is hauled back towards the centre of the room.
1) 291) dialog: Bitch! The house is growling  from basement to eaves now, as KIRSTY steps onto the landing.
1) 310) dialog: Come to Daddy! She slams the panel shut.  The distortions cease. So does the din.
