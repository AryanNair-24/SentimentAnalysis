0) 83) dialog: I got through.
0) 85) dialog: I found a room.
0) 90) dialog: I said: I found a room. We begin to draw back from KIRSTY now, as she continues t speak to her father.  She's sitting on a battered chair by the door.  The room she's in is cramped and dirty. From outside, the sound of trains going by.
0) 92) dialog: (pained)
0) 95) dialog: YOU'D like my room.
0) 97) dialog: (hastily)
0) 100) dialog: I'm not going to change my mind, Dad. As she speaks she reaches forward to pull a picture, tacked to the wall, of a ourangoutang, with breasts collaged onto it, down.  She succeeds.  Beneath there's a large hole in the wall, which the picture was there to conceal.  Plaster falls from it.
0) 101) dialog: (mouths the word)
0) 104) dialog: Maybe tomorrow.  I got to go look for a job.
0) 106) dialog: I love you too. She puts the receiver down.  As she does so the small table on which the 'phone is sitting collapses.  She covers her face with her hand.
0) 137) dialog: Hi.
0) 139) dialog: Not much. She moves past them, attempting to insinuate herself between the bed and the door-jamb.  They watch, enjoying her efforts.
0) 141) dialog: Dad? LARRY emerges from one of the rooms, looking harassed. His face lightens as he sees his daughter.
0) 143) dialog: Big house.
0) 145) dialog: Me like. Another hug.
0) 147) dialog: Is Julia here?
0) 150) dialog: (dryly)
0) 153) text: Kirsty.
0) 154) dialog: O.K.  I'll be nice.  You get on with the muscle work.  I'll make myself some coffee.
0) 173) dialog: Shit!  Shit! She reaches to turn the pressure down.
0) 177) dialog: (from kitchen)
0) 195) dialog: Have you got a towel? JULIA looks up.  At the top of the stairs, KIRSTY soaked from the tap.  JULIA looks up, and hurriedly pockets the photograph.
0) 197) dialog: Hi.  I got soaked.
0) 199) dialog: Which is where?
0) 203) dialog: Did Dad tell you I got a room, by the way?  Waterloo.  Centre of the known universe. Silence from outside. Julia? (she puts her head out of the bathroom)
0) 241) dialog: What's happening?
0) 243) dialog: Where's my father?
0) 249) dialog: Sure.
0) 271) dialog: What happened?
0) 273) dialog: Sure.
0) 280) text: the remains of a rack of lamb, its gravy now congealed, scraps of meat adhering to the bone here and there. This is the centre-piece of a table reduced to a battlefield by the guests who are laughing off-screen. We pass along the table, taking in dirty plates and cutlery, napkins, glasses and emptied wine bottles. Finally, we reach JULIA, who is still sitting at the table, while the others have retired to more comfortable seats.  She looks utterly miserable, and a little drunk. The room has been spruced up for the party.  Candles are burning on tables and mantelpiece, there are pictures on the walls.  But this is essentially cosmetic.  The place has not been refurnished or re- decorated. We move to the party guests.  Two, we recognize: KIRSTY, and LARRY - who is presently entertaining the gathering with an account of his accident.  The others are new faces.  An American couple:  BILL UNDERWOOD and his wife EVELYN, who are of an age with LARRY, and a younger, bespectacled man - a work colleague of LARRY's - STEVE O'DONNELL.  All are drunk. A brandy bottle sits on the table between them, and half a dozen other liquer bottles besides.  STEVE, it soon becomes apparent, has his eyes on KIRSTY. LARRY is half-way through his hospital story, gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale, much to the pleasure of the rest.  His hand and lower arm are heavily bandaged.
0) 296) dialog: (giggles)
0) 300) dialog: That's right.  Cointreau. STEVE picks up the bottle.
0) 302) dialog: I won't be able to stand.
0) 318) text: That's nice.  Well ... goodnight. She exits, to a chorus of goodnights.  KIRSTY in particular watches her as she makes her exit.  JULIA's behaviour confounds her.  Meanwhile, the conversation has returned to LARRY's 'wound'.
0) 341) dialog: Just upstairs. She staggers a little bit.
0) 343) dialog: I AM house-trained. Further hysteria.
0) 347) dialog: I know. She steps out into the hallway.
0) 360) dialog: Hello? JULIA moves out of shadow into a patch of patterned light splashing up the stair well.The effect recalls her memory of her lovemaking with FRANK.  The light makes her look strange; ominous.
0) 361) dialog: Oh, it's you. JULIA doesn't smile Are you all right? Do we read murder in JULIA's eyes?  KIRSTY is uneasy. Suddenly, a voice from the floor below.
0) 363) dialog: (calls down)
0) 366) dialog: (calls down)
0) 368) text: Sleep well. JULIA is left on the landing, as KIRSTY heads downstairs.
0) 370) dialog: You know I do know the way home.
0) 372) dialog: Not that late.
0) 374) dialog: (lightly)
0) 378) dialog: What do we do if there isn't?
0) 382) dialog: Yeah, there's room.  And there's Julia.
0) 384) dialog: She's so damn ... English.
0) 386) dialog: Oh, I don't know.  Up-tight. Frigid. STEVE stops walking.
0) 388) dialog: (lightly)
0) 392) dialog: Oh no?
0) 394) dialog: It's not what I heard.
0) 408) dialog: In a moment.

0) 415) dialog: I don't finish till twelve.
0) 552) dialog: I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
0) 562) text: Kirsty.
0) 635) dialog: Maybe you should give it some time.
0) 637) dialog: (skirting her real feelings)
0) 640) dialog: I don't know her.  She's so ... sealed up. LARRY's face is full of the desire for reassurance. KIRSTY tries to offer it. If YOU love her she must be worth loving.  Just give me some time. LARRY nods, a weak smile on his face
0) 642) dialog: Really?
0) 644) dialog: What?
0) 648) dialog: Sure.
1) 36) dialog: Oh my God. She starts to back away down the stairs.
1) 37) dialog: (shouts)
1) 40) dialog: Keep your fucking distance. Julia!  Where's Julia?  Christ, what have you done with her. She's still backing away. He's still advancing.
1) 42) dialog: No.
1) 44) dialog: No.
1) 46) dialog: No.  Get the fuck off me. He drags her back up the stairs.
1) 49) dialog: Don't touch me.  Or so help me -
1) 53) dialog: This isn't happening.
1) 56) dialog: (breathless)
1) 59) dialog: You want it? The monster's eyes glitter. Fucking have it! She throws the box.  It sails past FRANK and smashes through the window.
1) 71) dialog: This isn't happening.
1) 77) dialog: I think so.
1) 79) dialog: Tender.
1) 81) dialog: I want to speak to my father ...
1) 84) dialog: Why not? He offers her a reassuring smile.
1) 86) dialog: Um. He leaves the room. KIRSTY picks up the box, tentatively.  She turns it over in her hand, examining it.
1) 101) dialog: (smiles)
1) 104) dialog: (shakes her head)
1) 120) dialog: Where the hell did you come from? The CENOBITE gestures.  The box is lying on the bed.
1) 122) dialog: It's just a puzzle box.
1) 124) dialog: Who are you?
1) 126) dialog: Well, I didn't mean to open that thing.  You can go back wherever you came from.
1) 128) dialog: This isn't for real.
1) 130) dialog: Don't touch me! The door opens.  It's STEVE. KIRSTY's face floods with relief.  STEVE does not register the CENOBITES' presence however.
1) 131) dialog: Steve.  Thank God you came.
1) 133) dialog: These THINGS ... they want to take me -
1) 136) text: He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty.  And you to us.
1) 137) dialog: No!
1) 139) dialog: Don't let them take me, Steve -
1) 142) dialog: (to Steve)
1) 145) dialog: Just go.  PLEASE.  I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad.  He'll look after me -
1) 148) dialog: Will you GO, damn you? Mystified, STEVE retreats a step.
1) 150) dialog: Sure.  Why not? Still puzzled, STEVE crosses to the door.
1) 152) dialog: 'Bye.
1) 155) dialog: (almost crying)
1) 158) dialog: Wait! He stops.
1) 160) dialog: You did this before, right?
1) 162) dialog: To a man called Frank Cotton?
1) 164) dialog: But he escaped you.
1) 166) dialog: HE did.  I've seen him.  He's alive.
1) 168) dialog: I'll take you to him.  Then you take him instead of me.  Back wherever you come from. The CENOBITE stares at her unblinking.
1) 188) dialog: Please!   Dad!   It's me! It's Kirsty!
1) 193) dialog: Please, answer me!  Please - The door is suddenly opened.  JULIA is standing there.
1) 195) dialog: Where's Daddy?
1) 197) dialog: (stepping inside)
1) 202) dialog: I was here this afternoon.
1) 204) dialog: I saw everything.
1) 206) dialog: Oh God.  Thank God. (she starts to sob)
1) 211) dialog: No.  You don't understand. Your brother - Frank - he's here in the house.  And he's -
1) 213) dialog: Finished?
1) 216) dialog: Gone?
1) 223) dialog: I don't believe it.
1) 225) dialog: (tears in her eyes)
1) 228) dialog: Yes!
1) 230) text: Show her. KIRSTY turns away from LARRY.  JULIA leads her out into the Hallway.
1) 238) dialog: I have to get out. She shrugs off his arm.   The thunder is increasing.
1) 241) dialog: I can't stay. She goes to the door.
1) 247) dialog: (mouths)
1) 248) text: Oh my God. Everything is slowing down.  The bells and the thunder fill the soundtrack. LARRY smiles, as KIRSTY moves towards him.  Tears have begun to fill her eyes.   She searches for him.  His smile decays as he realizes her objective.   Her nails rake his cheek.   The flesh puckers, and tears along the brow.   Blood flows.   The mask of stolen flesh he wears slips a little, and FRANK's twisted features come into view.
1) 265) dialog: (a whisper)
1) 271) text: I'll go first - As he speaks, FRANK steps out of the Torture Room, knife in hand. Roaring, he comes at them both.  KIRSTY flings herself out of the path of the knife.  FRANK swipes at STEVE, who falls backwards down the stairs.   He cries out, head hitting the stairs as he descends. The box falls from his unconscious hand. FRANK turns on KIRSTY, who avoids one slice of the knife, and another, but is driven back into the Torture Room.
1) 273) dialog: God -
1) 275) dialog: Go on.   Kill me.  I don't care.
1) 277) dialog: You bastard
1) 279) dialog: Frank.
1) 283) dialog: (to Cenobite)
1) 288) text: This isn't for your eyes. KIRSTY crosses towards the door.  As she reaches for the handle she hears FRANK roar behind her.  She turns.   He breaks between the CENOBITES, knife in hand, but as he comes within striking distance the air is full of whining sounds and he stops dead. They have their hooks in him, we see.  In his arms and legs;  in his back and sides;  in his scalp and neck and temples.   Hooks attached to countless chains, which arrest his progress.  They plough through his flesh as he strives to reach her.  But at a gesture from the leade of the CENOBITES, the chains are hauled in.  He flings back his head, yelling.   The knife drops from his hand.
1) 296) dialog: We have to get out of here. They'll kill us for the fun of it. STEVE staggers to his feet.   KIRSTY picks up the box, which is on the lower landing. As she picks it up, the FEMALE CENOBITE steps from the shadows.
1) 301) text: Jesus Christ. They start down to the half-landing.  There stands the CENOBITE in the dark-glasses, carrying the hooked rod he threatened STEVE with in the hospital.  Again, KIRSTY manipulates the box.  Again, the CENOBITE howls and is claimed by the darkness.
1) 304) dialog: Julia? KIRSTY takes a step towards her, but as she does so the veil rises of its own accord, and the chattering CENOBITE is beneath. KIRSTY slams the box closed. The CENOBITE howls, and disappears. STEVE heads for the door.  Turns the handle. As he does so, KIRSTY realizes there's one piece of the box unfinished.
1) 305) dialog: Don't! Too late.  He turns the handle.   The door is flung open, and THE ENGINEER, clinging to the sides of the door, swings down into the hallway. STEVE is flung backwards against KIRSTY.    The box falls from KIRSTY's hand.  The beast moves to bite at STEVE, who scrambles out of the way, leaving KIRSTY in the front line. The box lies between KIRSTY and THE ENGINEER, which now uses its forelegs to crawl over the hallway towards her, its legs still bracing it in the door. She snatches for the box.  THE ENGINEER, its mouth oozing fluids, almost catches her arm. Again, she tries.   This time one of its arms seizes hold of KIRSTY and drags her towards its jaws. Behind KIRSTY, STEVE snatches up a piece of plaster and flings it in THE ENGINEER's face.  It momentarily relaxes its grip on KIRSTY, who slides her hand from its hold and claims the box.  She now has slime on her finger The box defies her manipulations.
1) 307) dialog: Shit.  Shit.  Shit. THE ENGINEER is almost upon her.  It rears up, its saliva dropping on her. And then, miraculously, the last piece of the box slots i place.
1) 308) text: The same vortex that seized the other CENOBITE seizes THE ENGINEER.   Howling its complaint, it is drawn out into the darkness beyond the door, and disappears. Its voice grows thin, and fades. Finally, silence. The house is still. KIRSTY gets to her feet.  STEVE does the same. Together, they move to the door, and out onto the step.
1) 311) dialog: (quietly)
