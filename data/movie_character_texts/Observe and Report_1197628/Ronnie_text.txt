I see the crime...                     and I phone it in. And that's                      what I'm getting ready to do right                 now.

If you step foot                     on mall property, it is considered                  trespassing. At that point, I                       call the police, they come down,                    you go directly to jail.

9) 4) text: Mark, the Mall Manager, walks up to Ronnie.

9) 22) dialog: You want me to phone this one in                    to the police?                                     
9) 26) dialog: Hold on, Mark. Let me make sure I                   understand you. You're telling me                   to deny my primary objective of                     Observing and Reporting crime and                   at the same time, you're giving me                  authorization to handle this case                   on my own.                                         
9) 30) dialog: So basically, I'm in charge of                      this whole investigation.                          
9) 34) dialog: Not yet. Okay, Mark, I'll do it,                    but I'm gonna need a few things                     first.

9) 42) dialog: That's perfect.

9) 56) dialog: Understood. Thank you for this                        opportunity, Mark. I won't let                        you down.

10) 40) dialog: First of all, if there was a                         situation to be handled, I don't see why you find it so goddamn ridiculous that I would be in charge.
10) 45) dialog: Well for your information, I'm in charge of this whole fucking operation.
10) 54) dialog: I don't give a goddamn if you believe me or not, Ms. Hot Fuckin' SHIT news lady. I'm the first                        line of defense against this pervert. As the law's right hand,                    I'm here so that people like you can live in your own little happy world and think places like this mall are safe and fun. I'm the defender of this war zone. Just me and my goddamn flashlight.

10) 68) dialog: Sir, I will be forced to take action if you do not step back!

11) 2) text: Ronnie stands back and watches Brandi.       Finally, he up to her.

Especially the blue around your                       eyes. I bet it drives the men                         crazy.                                               
11) 8) text: Brandi glares at Ronnie.
11) 10) dialog: It's okay.   I can say that because                   I'm taken.                                           
11) 20) dialog: I'm here on official business.                      See, I don't know if you know                       this, but I have recently been                      made Head of Mall Security. Did                     you hear about that?                               
11) 24) dialog: Well, I'm sure you will. It's                       actually pretty huge news. But                      the reason I stopped by is to tell                  you that it looks like we've got a                  pervert on the loose. A real live                   psychopath who gains sexual                         gratification by exposing himself                   to ladies such as yourself. I                       just want to warn you to be                         careful when coming and going to                    work.

11) 32) dialog: You know what skirts. Something                     like that could set him off. And                    for that matter, you better not                     wear any of those little low-cut                    top things either, okay?                            Especially with those black bras                    because, you can really see them                    in the light. Perverts really                       tend to notice stuff like that.                     Okay, see you later.                               
11) 33) text: Ronnie takes off and leaves Brandi still applying make- up.
12) 9) dialog: Dennis, man, I'm glad we've got a minute to talk. There's no easy                  way to say this so I'm just going                to come right out with it. Mark                  offered me the position of Head of               Mall Security. I know this isn't                 easy for you to hear seeing as                   you've been here longer than me.                 But I want you to know that you're               my best friend and I'm only going                to accept the job if you're okay                 with that.                                      
12) 12) dialog: Well, you should know I've already               accepted and it's too late to turn               it down now. Every ship needs a                  captain. So you were passed over.                Who gives a shit? Dennis, in                     time, you'll come to accept                      answering to me. Remember, there                 aren't any leaders in friendship.                We cool?

14) 23) text: Ronnie flips the wrist lock tighter!

BEEP no you don't. As the law's right hand, I'm the                     first line of defense against this pervert.

15) 37) dialog: My official orders are Observe and                 Report, but when Mark put me in                    charge of mall security, something                 inside of me changed. It's what                    I've always wanted. Things                         haven't always worked out, with                    the whole... well, you know.

16) 21) dialog: You did?
16) 25) dialog: My young friend, you are sorely                      mistaken. Do you know how much                       stuff I'm in charge of?                             
16) 29) dialog: A shitload. That's not even                          counting the parking lot.                           
16) 33) dialog: No way, that's about like 75,                        maybe 82 percent of it. There's                      so much other stuff.                                
16) 43) dialog: Two words, Friday Night.                             
16) 47) dialog: It's crazy, let's just leave it at                    that.                                                
16) 51) dialog: Listen. I like you, but I don't                       like the fact that you're                             masquerading as an official in the                    security world. If you're serious                     about a career in the security                        world, then perhaps I could look                      into getting you a job on my                          staff?                                               
16) 55) dialog: Part of my job is reaching out to                     troubled youths such as yourself.                     It's who I am.

We can't                       just hire any old Tom, Dick, or                       Harry just because they want to                       carry a flashlight.

If this works out, then                     I will phone the crime into the                      police. Now, this will train your                    eyes to spot various criminal                        activity. Once you have completed                    your training, you will be awarded                   an official position on my                           security staff where you will have                   the duty of actually phoning in                      crimes to the police yourself.                      
16) 79) dialog: For starters.                                       
16) 83) dialog: Until Mark lets me hire another                      guy.

16) 105) dialog: Okay, look alive, soldier. Deputy                  time starts now. No more slacker                   attitude for you.                                 
16) 106) text: Ronnie walks away, but after he takes a few steps, he stops and turns.

18) 46) dialog: Brandi! I came as soon as I                         heard. Jesus, are you alright?
18) 52) dialog: This is one of the most heinous                     things I've seen. Jesus, I tried                    to tell you about the skirts.                       It's not your fault, you little                     fighter you. Ronnie's not mad,                      okay?                                              
18) 56) dialog: Rogers.                                            
18) 60) dialog: Don't worry.   I'll carry you.
18) 61) text: Ronnie reaches down and picks up Brandi. She totally lets him. Ronnie struggles and can't lift her. It looks dumb.
18) 70) text: Ronnie finally manages to lift Brandi. He carries her out of the Department Store and down through the middle of the mall.
20) 1) text: Mark sits at his desk, while Ronnie comforts a crying Brandi. Dennis stands in the corner, not saying a word.
20) 21) dialog: My name is Ronnie Barnhardt, chief inspector on the case and head of Mall Security here at Carolina Mall and this is my lieutenant, Dennis. From one law enforcement                     officer to another, I just want to                   welcome you and say that we will                     do whatever it takes to coordinate                   with your department in order to                     bring this assailant to justice.                    
20) 28) dialog: Did you get a blood sample?                         
20) 32) dialog: That's a shame. Would have been                      useful.                                             
20) 39) text: Detective Harrison begins writing in his note pad as Brandi speaks. Ronnie notices this and picks up some paper and begins to write as well.
20) 59) dialog: This is what I got so far.
20) 60) text: Ronnie holds up his paper. Ronnie has drawn a crude sketch of the Pervert that Brandi described, but it's basically a long-haired stick figure with a penis.
20) 62) dialog: What's yours look like?
20) 66) dialog: Oh.
20) 67) text: Ronnie puts his sketch away.
20) 81) dialog: I'm afraid I'm going to have to                      disagree with you there,                             Detective. By my math, it seems                      pretty clear that Brandi's been                      targeted.                                           
20) 85) dialog: Well, how about the fact that she was the first employee to get                        assaulted? Not to mention the fact that she is the prettiest girl who works at this mall. To me it seems obvious that this is some sort of methodical villain that plans on returning to finish what he started by murdering Brandi.                                             
20) 90) text: Ronnie looks at Brandi and nods his head "yes."
20) 94) dialog: That's right, Brandi, you've got                     the best team in law enforcement                     working for you.                                    
20) 108) text: Ronnie holds out his hand.
20) 112) dialog: I'll take one of those cards as well.
20) 115) text: Detective Harrison reluctantly hands Ronnie a card.
20) 117) dialog: Go ahead and write your home phone                     on there as well in case I need to                     get a hold of you.                                    
20) 121) dialog: Sorry, but I'm gonna need those                        digits. If we're gonna solve this                      crime we need to constantly be in                      communication with each other and                      have an open door policy with                          intelligence. Brandi, let me see                       that card.                                            
20) 122) text: Ronnie takes the car from Brandi and copies the home phone number from the back.
20) 124) dialog: Cool, I'll call you later with an                      update.                                               
20) 134) dialog: It's no problem at all. We're                        brothers of the badge. This is                       what we do for each other.                          
20) 135) text: Detective Harrison takes off.      Ronnie looks around happily.
20) 137) dialog: Seems like a good guy. A little                      green, but still solid.                             
21) 1) text: The mall is winding down for the day and most of the customers have gone home. Ronnie walks through the mall, taping up pictures of the sketch he made of the Pervert.
21) 6) dialog: Just putting these posters up.                      
21) 10) dialog: That's what it's like when you                       date the Head of Mall Security.                      The downside is we don't get to                      see each other as much, but the                      upside is you get to brag to all                     your friends.                                       
21) 14) dialog: Sure, let's take off.                               
22) 8) text: The living room is dark. Ronnie and Nell are on the couch making out. Ronnie is starting to get frisky. His hands go to Nell's boobs, but only outside of the shirt. She allows it.
22) 9) text: Ronnie decides to push it. He takes his hand and tries to go up her shirt. Nell immediately stops kissing and pushes Ronnie away.
22) 13) dialog: Come on, let me get some of those                    big bazoombas.                                      
22) 14) text: Ronnie goes in hard for the tits, but Nell pushes him away.
22) 18) dialog: Goddamn it, are we ever gonna do                     it?                                                 
22) 22) dialog: We did, it's just, well, I'm tired                   of just doing what we do. I'm                        ready for something bigger. Like                     sex or just maybe using a finger                     on you --                                           
22) 26) dialog: Well, I used to be, it's just. I                     don't know. What's so great about                    being a 27-year-old virgin?                         
22) 29) dialog: Nell, I'm sorry. Don't go away                       like this.                                          
22) 39) dialog: I do.   I really do. I'm sorry,                       Nell.                                                
22) 43) dialog: I'll stop by for breakfast                            tomorrow.

25) 11) text: Ronnie gives Detective Harrison a hug.
25) 13) dialog: I'm ready to go to war with you.                     
25) 17) dialog: I've already checked the Security                     tapes. They didn't catch a thing.                     Someone must have broken in here                      and turned them off.
25) 23) dialog: Laser technology.                                    
25) 27) dialog: Detective Harrison, can I ask you                     how long you've been a detective                      for?                                                 
25) 37) dialog: Just as I thought, a rookie.                         
25) 41) dialog: Yeah, you're a rookie, okay. It's                     fine, you'll learn with                               experience. And when you do,                          you'll discover that rule #1 of                       law enforcement is that you don't                     ever turn on a fellow officer.                        Now, I know you would never                           actually accuse somebody on my                        Security Force of committing this                     act of lawlessness.                                  
25) 45) dialog: Look, my record speaks for itself                     and as for Dennis, well I can                         certainly vouch for him. Dennis                       is one of the finest men I know,                      so just take my word, you're                          barking up the wrong tree. Now,                       let's put this little squabble                        behind us and get back to busting                     the guys that robbed this mall.
25) 53) dialog: I understand too, sir.                               
25) 63) dialog: No can do, Mark. When you                            appointed me Head of Mall                            Security, I swore an oath to                         protect this mall and aid in                         bringing crime to its knees.                        
25) 67) dialog: To myself I did.                                    
25) 71) dialog: There's only one cook. I'm a                         chef. A cook and chef, together,                     serving up justice.

26) 12) dialog: What I need for you to understand                    is that just because Detective                       Harrison is here, doesn't mean                       that you and me are no longer best                   friends. Sure, Harrison would be                     cool to hang out with. He carries                    a badge and a gun. He probably                       owns a boat. Over time, we'll                        probably become really close like                    brothers, but for right now,                         you're still number one. Now, I                      must leave you behind because duty                   calls, so... chin up. Radio if                       you need anything.

27) 8) text: Detective Harrison hands Saddamn his card and begins to leave. Disgusted, Ronnie comes walking up.
27) 10) dialog: (to Harrison) My turn, Rookie.                                    
27) 14) dialog: Solving the whole case right                         before your eyes.                                   
27) 24) dialog: Hello, Saddamn.
27) 28) dialog: I want your ass to face the music is what I want.
27) 34) dialog: So you're just gonna let him slip right through your fingers?
27) 38) dialog: No reason? Look at him. There's every reason in the goddamn book.
27) 42) dialog: I think it's obvious, Saddamn.
27) 46) dialog: You're not even black.

28) 27) dialog: Communication skills, watch and learn.
28) 28) text: Ronnie steps into the forefront.
28) 30) dialog: Que pasa?
28) 34) dialog: Como?
28) 38) dialog: Si. (to Harrison) Yeah, this guy definitely did it.
28) 42) dialog: I don't know, I don't speak Spanish, but judging from his tonal inflections, it's safe to say that he's hiding something. The only question is where. (to Janitor) Okay, Ramon, I'm giving you one chance and one chance only to come clean. Or else Detective Harrison is going to come over to your house and deport your whole family back to Mexico.
28) 46) dialog: Good cop, bad cop, just play along. (to Ramon) Where are you hiding the jewels?
28) 56) dialog: Alright, you're gonna make me be the bad guy here? Well, that's a role I'm comfortable playing. Let's just see what you're hiding.

28) 67) dialog: Okay, my mistake. Sir, you're                       free to go. Uh, you might want to have someone clean this up which in this case is you, so, uh, chop- chop. Wouldn't want anyone to slip on this mess.
28) 68) text: Ronnie leaves the Janitor with a bewildered look.
29) 1) text: Ronnie follows Detective Harrison into the lingerie store. They approach the counter where a HOT CLERK is working the register.
29) 13) dialog: And I'm Ronnie Barnhardt, head of Mall Security.
29) 17) dialog: Come on, we're working here.
29) 28) text: The Sexy Worker holds the undies up to her crotch. Ronnie looks and his tongue almost drops out of his mouth. He straightens himself out.
29) 32) dialog: You're gonna let them distract you with a little bit of panty showing.    You have got a lot to learn, my friend. (to the Hot Clerk) Who are you protecting, toots?
29) 42) dialog: Look, I'm sure you and your little friend have made a real lifestyle for yourselves here. It's probably easy for you to blind most men with your beauty, but I'm not most men. I can see through the sexuality to the truth. Jewelry, gold, diamonds, you don't really expect me to think that a man wants that crap. I'm putting you on my list of top suspects. I don't think you did the crime, but I do think you are an accomplice.

31) 2) text: Ronnie picks up a hammer.
31) 4) dialog: Now, maybe I'm crazy or maybe I'm the smartest man alive, but it seems kind of convenient to me that you sell hammers like this one that could easily be used to smash a glass case in, oh say, a jewelry store.
31) 8) dialog: You really think you're gonna talk your way out of this one?
32) 1) text: Ronnie is hanging out with Dennis and the Bouncer from O'Charley's. Behind him, Nell works the counter at Cinnabon.

I mean, that's                       what this job is supposed to be                      like. Busting loiterers and kids                     who steal pennies from the                           fountain has its rewards, but                        really getting in there and                          closing cases is where it's at.                      It's rewarding too because at the                    end of the day, you know you've                      done something good for the world.

32) 17) dialog: Well, my young apprentice. I                         called you here today because as                     Head of Mall Security, I have                        decided that it's time to take                       protection to the next level. In                     other words, I alone cannot combat                   this recent crime wave. In order                     to help me in my personal journey,                   I have decided to divide up the                      tasks between my soldiers. So,                       for now on, Dennis, my right-hand                    man, you will be in charge of                        solving the case of who is robbing                   the mall. Little Chucky, you will                    be on the case of the Pervert.                       You are both to collect data and                     provide it to me. I will analyze                     the data, draw conclusions, and                      solve these crimes as well as                        coordinate and strategize with                       various law enforcement agencies.                   
32) 27) dialog: You can't measure honor in dollars                    and cents.

32) 36) dialog: Yeah, but, you don't think she's                      kind of hot?                                         
32) 40) dialog: Fuck no. There's no way I'd date                      that... person who's obviously not                    hot.                                                 
32) 41) text: Nell waves again, but Ronnie just kind of turns away, ignoring her.
32) 43) dialog: Anyway, our new unit will operate                     under the name, 'Special Elite                        Task Force.' You will answer                          directly to me and no one else.                       Now, let's all put our hands in                       the middle and do a unifying                          cheer.
32) 44) text: Ronnie puts his hand out.     Dennis puts his in as well. Charles isn't sure.
32) 48) dialog: Seven even.   I promise.                             
32) 57) dialog: One, two, three, TASK FORCE!                         
32) 58) text: Ronnie is the only one who gets into it.      It's a weak cheer.
32) 60) dialog: Okay, so now I say we all take a                      celebratory trip to Sears because,                    as we all know, today is half-                        price day on all automotive parts                     for mall employees.

34) 2) text: On top of the Pyramid is a combination drawing/picture of Ronnie. The body is drawn with his arms folded across his chest and a photo of his face is tacked on top. The whole thing adds up to nonsense, with the only clear idea is that he defeats them all. Ronnie sits back in his chair and stares at the board.
34) 13) dialog: It's no interruption.   What are                     you still doing here?

37) 15) dialog: Look, I got to talk to you about                    something. I'm not really sure                      how to put this. Let's see. If                      you drove a Toyota.                                
37) 19) dialog: I know, but let's just pretend you                  drove a Toyota. Now, this Toyota                    runs really good. It always                         starts when you need it to and it                   gets good gas mileage and you                       don't have to do much to maintain                   it. Then you get a really                           important job like Astronaut, no                    that won't work, you get a job as                   the head of Wall Street. Well,                      you may really like that Toyota,                    but you're going to feel weird                      about driving it to work every                      day, right? Now let's say that                      somebody offers you a chance to                     get rid of that Toyota and instead                  you get a Ferrari. It may be more                   expensive and harder to drive, but                  I mean, it just looks good as                       hell. What would you do?                           
37) 23) dialog: You would trade up, Nell. Well,                     that's exactly what I'm doing.                     
37) 27) dialog: No, Nell, I'm getting a new                         girlfriend.                                        
37) 31) dialog: This girl, Brandi.                                 
37) 41) dialog: Yeah, I mean, no, she's not a                        slut. But you're thinking of the                     right person.                                       
37) 45) dialog: I'm sorry. I don't mean to hurt                      you. It's just, well, I believe                      in this world, you play the hand                     you're dealt and at this point in                    my life, I've been dealt five                        Aces. I'd be a fool not to bet.                     
37) 49) dialog: I have to, Nell.                                    
37) 53) dialog: Of course I love you.                               
37) 57) dialog: Because I've never dated the prom                    queen before.                                       
37) 61) dialog: Come on.   Why do you have to bring                  that up?                                            
37) 71) dialog: Even if I do fall, it won't                          matter, because I'm learning to                      fly.                                                
37) 72) text: Ronnie stands up and walks away. Nell sits there sad. She looks down at her Cinnabon and devours the whole thing.
38) 1) text: Ronnie looks through a clothing rack. It's full of cheap fabrics, lots of imitation silks and shit. A SLICK SALESMAN approaches Ronnie.
38) 5) dialog: Yeah, um, I've got a really special date tonight with a hot young lady -- Do you know Brandi?                   
38) 9) dialog: Never mind. Anyway, I need something that's really 'cool.' Something that will impress her                      and I guess you could say I'm not                    exactly in the know with what the hipsters are up to these days.
38) 13) dialog: Um, I guess love, but uh...
38) 23) dialog: Watch it, man.     She's a lady.   But yes.
39) 1) text: Ronnie's Mom sits on his bed with a bottle of Wild Turkey. She waits for Ronnie to come out of the closet.
39) 5) dialog: It's too tight in the butt.
39) 8) text: Ronnie comes out of the closet and he's wearing a ridiculous fucking outfit. It's an imitation silk button up, with a pair of black parachute pants. There's two belts for some DOUBLE BELT action. He's got no socks on and a pair of white shoes. He looks like a goddamn fool.
39) 11) dialog: Really, you don't think I look like a phony.
39) 15) dialog: Yeah, I guess these clothes are kind of cool.
39) 19) dialog: Its not Nell, Mom.                                    
39) 29) dialog: I did too. But then I met this                         girl Brandi and she swept me off                       my feet.                                              
39) 33) dialog: I actually feel kind of bad about                      Nell, but I figure that I can pour                     all the sadness into Brandi and                        just really rely on her for my                         happiness instead of Nell.                            
39) 37) dialog: She is, Mom. She's the most perfect girl in the whole world.
39) 41) dialog: I hope that happens tonight.
39) 44) text: Ronnie's Mom holds up her finger for Ronnie.       It's a giant yellow/cottony-looking diamond ring.
39) 46) dialog: Is that a yellow diamond?                             
39) 56) dialog: Mom, why did Dad leave?
39) 60) dialog: Do you think it was my fault that Dad left?
39) 64) dialog: Well, I didn't know, with the drinking and all.
39) 67) text: Ronnie nods.
39) 71) dialog: I love you, too, Mom.
40) 1) text: The restaurant is the cheesiest of all sea food restaurants. Think one step down from Red Lobster. Ronnie sits across the table from Brandi. She chugs one of those giant frozen drinks, killing it in one gulp.
40) 3) dialog: Damn, that was pretty impressive.
40) 13) dialog: Well, Brandi, can I just say that                    you look absolutely beautiful tonight.
40) 17) dialog: Yeah, yeah.   No problem.
40) 20) text: Ronnie takes a pill bottle out of his pocket.       He op it up and pops a pill.
40) 24) dialog: Oh, it's nothing.
40) 28) dialog: It's just a pill I'm supposed to take.
40) 31) text: Ronnie hands the pills to Brandi.
40) 35) dialog: The Doctor.
40) 45) dialog: Yeah, I guess I party like this every four to six hours as needed.
40) 49) dialog: Help yourself.
40) 54) dialog: So, how do you like working at the mall?
40) 58) dialog: Yeah, I see how that could get to you.
40) 62) dialog: That's a lot.
40) 66) dialog: So, Brandi, I hope I'm not being                      too forward, but do you have a boyfriend?
40) 76) dialog: Yes!
40) 80) dialog: Yeah, I understand. I hate ties. I recently cut mine and now I'm                      free like a bird.
40) 84) text: Ronnie holds up a shot to toast.
40) 86) dialog: To new beginnings.
40) 91) dialog: Okay.
40) 92) text: Ronnie takes his shot.
40) 96) dialog: No more.    I'm sticking to beer.
40) 100) dialog: God, you remind me so much of my                     mother.                                             
40) 111) dialog: You are so beautiful.
41) 1) text: Ronnie's car is a piece-of-shit Subaru. Brandi is shit- faced and yelling at people out of the window.
41) 6) dialog: Brandi, this is the most fun I've                    ever had on a date.
41) 10) dialog: Wooo! Um, so, Brandi, it's no                        secret that I'm attracted to you.                    I think everybody in the mall is.                    As you know, I recently split with                   my girlfriend and basically, I was                   wondering if, since you don't have                   a boyfriend, that I could maybe be                   your boyfriend and you could be my girlfriend?
41) 13) text: Ronnie hits the brakes.
42) 1) text: Ronnie opens Brandi's door and helps Brandi out. She's almost passed out drunk. Both of her eyes are closed and she immediately tries to sleep on the ground. Ronnie helps her up, but when he does, Brandi gives him a kiss -- a sloppy one.
42) 9) dialog: Brandi, I had a wonderful time                       tonight.
42) 12) text: They kiss again, but when they do, Brandi pukes all over the place. It's a disgusting puke and there's vomit on her cheek and stuff. Ronnie holds her head for her.
42) 14) dialog: Are you okay?
42) 17) text: Ronnie looks longingly into her eyes.
42) 19) dialog: I love you, Brandi.                                 
42) 23) dialog: I don't care.                                       
42) 24) text: Ronnie kisses Brandi passionately on the mouth. He walks her inside the house. On the way in, she falls over. Ronnie helps her up. He carries her into the house where the make-love spot is.
43) 1) text: Ronnie is with Dennis in the food court. Ronnie is smiling, but Dennis isn't saying a word as usual.
43) 3) dialog: Don't look at me like that,                          Dennis. I told you I wouldn't                        talk.                                               
43) 4) text: Ronnie sits back, but he can't help a giant grin on his face.
43) 12) dialog: I'm serious, Dennis. A gentleman                   never kisses and tells. So, just                   stop with all the pressure because                 it's just not gonna happen.                       
43) 13) text: Ronnie keeps on grinning at Dennis.
43) 15) dialog: Okay, fine, you son of a bitch,                    you want details, I'll give you                    details. I had sex with Brandi                     last night.                                       
43) 16) text: Dennis and Ronnie high-five.
43) 18) dialog: It was amazing. I mean, I've                       never experienced anything like                    it. I've been with a girl or two.                 
43) 19) text: Dennis stares at Ronnie.
43) 21) dialog: Okay, fine, I've been with a girl,                 but let me tell you, this was so                   much better. You know how many                     times we did it? Twice! BAM!                       BAM! BAM!                                         
43) 25) text: Nell, who looks like she's been crying nonstop, stuffs a whole Cinnabon into her face. As it fills her cheeks, she looks over to Ronnie's table and sees Ronnie making thrusting motions at the table. Nell swallows, stuffs another Cinnabon in, then storms out of the Food Court.
43) 29) text: Ronnie continues to talk to Dennis.
43) 31) dialog: But I got to tell you, Dennis. It                  was steamy and sexy, but more than                 anything, I should tell you that                   it's her soul that I fell for the                  most. She got pretty tanked, but                   I could just really tell that                      she's a good person. The kind of                   person that I could see myself                     with.                                             
43) 40) dialog: Look, I'm gonna get out of here.                     There's a lot of people I need to                    tell about this, so I'll catch up                    with you later. Oh, and I almost                     forgot, keep your eyes peeled for                    crime and stuff.                                    
43) 41) text: Ronnie leaves the table.
45) 1) text: Ronnie looks at the colorful flowers in the glass refrigerator. The FLOWER SALESMAN walks up to Ronnie.
45) 5) dialog: You have?                                          
45) 8) text: The Flower Salesman winks and starts laughing. Ronnie doesn't. It gets weird so the Flower Salesman stops.
45) 10) dialog: What color of roses do the women like anyway?                                       
45) 20) dialog: Yeah, we're way past the color white if you know what I mean. What about the yellow ones?
45) 24) dialog: I don't even know what to make of that.
45) 28) dialog: Next.
45) 32) dialog: Why didn't you just say that?    I'm a busy man here.
45) 36) dialog: Forget it. Give me a big bag of the red ones.
45) 40) dialog: Go ahead.
45) 44) dialog: I've only been on one date with                      her, but I could see myself being                    with her for all of eternity.                       
45) 54) dialog: Seems   like a big bag of roses would   be more love than just one, but I   guess you're the expert. Gimme   one.
45) 55) text: The Flower Salesman takes a single red rose from the case and hands it to Ronnie.
46) 1) text: Brandi is behind the counter gossiping with Bruce. Ronnie holds his rose and watches them from a distance. He takes a deep breath and then walks to the counter.
46) 3) dialog: Brandi?                                               
46) 7) dialog: I came here to see you. And to present you with this single red rose. It symbolizes 'love.'
46) 11) dialog: Well, after last night,   I just wanted you to know that   it wasn't just some fling to me.    It meant something special and I   felt it deep in my soul.
46) 17) text: Brandi grabs Ronnie and pulls him off to the side.
46) 27) dialog: I remember it for the both of us.                   
46) 31) dialog: I'm the head of Mall Security.                      
46) 35) dialog: Brandi, I know exactly what you                      mean. And I just want to thank                       you for being honest. You're                         telling me I'm not living up to my                   full potential in life. It's                         funny, because I've been feeling                     like this for quite some time. I                     guess I just needed that extra                       little push to get me over this                      hurdle I've been stuck on. How                       can you be with a man who isn't                      living the life he was meant to?                    
46) 39) dialog: I don't like it, Brandi, but I do                    understand. I promise you this.                      Next time you see me, I will be                      wearing a uniform that will make                     you proud. I will be the man that                    you will be honored to call your                     life's love.                                        
46) 49) dialog: I will though. I'll bet                               everything I have on you. Now I                       ask you for one favor. Although I                     am unworthy, will you accept this                     rose from me anyway?                                 
46) 52) text: Brandi walks away, leaving Ronnie there holding his flower.
47) 3) dialog: I'm here to become a police officer.
47) 7) dialog: I have a GED.
47) 11) dialog: You bet your ass I am.
47) 24) dialog: That sounds fun. Sign me up.
48) 1) text: Ronnie sits in the unmarked police car with Detective Harrison.
48) 3) dialog: It's like it was meant to be. You                   behind the wheel. Me riding shotgun.                Two brothers of the badge unite to                  form the ultimate crime-stopping combo.             I'm psyched to be here, Harrison.                   Thank you for the opportunity.                     
48) 7) dialog: I know. You want to know the                        truth. It's because I respect                       you. See, when we're at the mall,                   it's obviously my turf. Sure, I                     break your balls about being a                      rookie, but out here in the                         streets, I'm the rookie. I'm here                   to learn. Teach me.                                
48) 11) dialog: I've wanted to be a Police officer                  all my life.                                       
48) 20) dialog: Don't get me wrong, I love keeping the mall safe, but you guys are the ones that really enforce justice and protect, not just our mall, but our whole community. I don't tell the guys on my squad this, but the Security Guard job was just temporary.
48) 24) dialog: Right, we're not back at the station anymore so we can cut the charade.
48) 28) dialog: Well, I know that policy demands I stay out of the way, but between you and me, I just want you to know that if anything pops off tonight, I'm going to jump right in there and take 'em down with you.
48) 32) dialog: I get you. You have to say this in order to keep you safe 'legally' speaking. I should probably follow along too. 'I swear I won't get out of the car and fight justice tonight.'
48) 36) dialog: I know.
48) 37) text: Ronnie winks at Detective Harrison.    A smile comes acro Harrison's face.
49) 1) text: Ronnie and Detective Harrison sit in the parked car. They're at the shittiest crack corner in the whole town. Lots of scary bums and hookers loiter around the car.
49) 3) dialog: Yeah, so then I basically saw his                    ass trying to circumvent around                      the ped exit and slip through the                    employ exit. Not allowed. The                        two ped exits are to be used                         only --                                             
49) 7) dialog: Yeah, I see it.
49) 11) dialog: Shit, I've heard of that.
49) 15) dialog: I don't know.    It looks pretty shitty to me.
49) 25) dialog: Oh, yeah, I can see that it's basically a fine neighborhood.                       
49) 29) dialog: I use that same technique at the mall.
49) 33) dialog: Really?
49) 37) dialog: You can count on me.     Thank you for the honor.
49) 41) dialog: I won't let you down.
49) 42) text: Ronnie   opens the door and gets out of the car. As he exits,   a car drives by BLARING RAP MUSIC. The passenger throws   a beer bottle at Ronnie. He dodges it and the bottle   shatters on the ground.
49) 43) text: Ronnie is shaken, but he waves to Detective Harrison like he's okay. Detective Harrison waves back, then PEELS OUT OF THERE. Ronnie is confused.
49) 51) dialog: Where are you going?!
50) 1) text: Ronnie looks petrified as he stands guard.       A BUM st off to the side staring Ronnie down.
50) 2) text: Ronnie waves to the bum. The bum runs his finger under his throat. Ronnie tries to ignore him.
50) 3) text: A group of KIDS walk by Ronnie talking loudly.
50) 5) dialog: Hey, no horse play. You guys get on home.

Everybody in                    life gets to go for their goals,                     why should I be any different?

83) 5) dialog: Can I speak now?
83) 9) dialog: Are you sure?
83) 19) dialog: It seems only natural that 'some people' would want to blame me and truth be told I do put a lot of that blame on myself. But some people might say that the cops are to blame for not catching them. Some people might say that the reason this happened was the undeniable fact that I was under- equipped and quite frankly, lacking a sufficient firearm. But not me.

Because there is no                         fucking way my team is going to                    work here if you fire me. Isn't                    that right, Charles?                              
83) 42) dialog: And you told him to fuck off,                         right? Charles? Right?

84) 26) dialog: Nothing. That's exactly what                           you're supposed to do. I just                          blew my life. I tried to be a big                      shot, a hero and a stupid cop. I                       wanted to be recognized for being                      great. I should have just been                         happy where I was at. I didn't do                      my duty.

I guess what I'm saying                         is...
