I knew you                         would be there to find me and take                     care of me, so I was able to pass                      out on the floor and not worry.                        If there's one thing you know                          about, it's duty.

I've got                            everything I need with you. So I                     want you to know that I'm ready to                   make a change. Your life needs to                    get easier and you don't need to                     take care of old Mom anymore.

84) 49) dialog: I'm proud of you. Now today is a                     new day and we're going to get                       through it. Now, get out there                       and find what the world has in                       store for you.
