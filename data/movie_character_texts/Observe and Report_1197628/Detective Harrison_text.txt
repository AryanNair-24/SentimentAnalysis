20) 24) dialog: Great.                                               (back to Brandi)                            Okay, Brandi. Did you get a look                     at the suspect?

25) 19) dialog: My team just checked all the doors and there are no signs of forced                      entry. I've also checked out the                      crime scene, but we didn't see any fingerprints on the glass. The suspect was probably wearing gloves.
