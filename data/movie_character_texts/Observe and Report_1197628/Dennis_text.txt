I look at this place like a motherfucking jail sentence. You put on that uniform every morning, but what are you really protecting? Commerce and corporations and money. Well I say, fuck that! I'm                            a fucking outlaw and I'm going to live that until the day I die. Now, I can show you the way, but you've got to be willing to accept it.

I know most people                          don't think it's shit, but I                          really loved it.

So I got pissed off. I started                robbing the joint as a way to get             at them for what they did to me.              But you know what, Ronnie?                   
86) 46) dialog: You ever love a girl so much that             you can't break up with her, so               the only thing you can do when she            pisses you off is smack her in the            goddamn face?                                
86) 50) dialog: Well, I have. And that's pretty               much how I felt about the job.               
86) 54) dialog: Well, it's the least I could do               after knocking you out and all.
