9) 24) dialog: Not just yet. See if we call the                    police, they'll be a big scandal                    and something like that could kill                  what little traffic we have at                      this mall. What I need you to do                    is watch out for this Pervert and                   if you see him, try to stop him or                  quietly phone it in so we can                       handle this discreetly.

18) 9) dialog: (to the crowd) Alright, people, she's doing good. We're just gonna get her down to my office and everything's going to be fine, so the best thing for you employees to do is just get on back to your stations and you customers can go ahead and enjoy the back to school savings here at                    Carolina Mall.

25) 61) dialog: Ronnie, you are to leave Detective Harrison alone and let him handle the investigation.

53) 8) dialog: Is it, Ronnie? I mean, the mall                     is getting butchered in the press.                  Somebody who works here is ripping                  the place off. The cops don't                       have any leads. I'm getting shit                    from the owner of the mall. Sales                   are down. I mean, what's so good                    about this morning?

53) 39) dialog: Alright, it's actually not a bad                     idea. It might make our Security                     more visible so we can give people                   the illusion that we're on top of                    this.                                               
53) 44) dialog: Ronnie, one more thing. Look, if                     this crime doesn't come to an end                    pretty soon, we're gonna have to                     let someone go. I mean, you've                       always done a great job for me,                      but the truth is, someone is going                   to have to take the fall. You're                     the one who wanted to be Head of                     Mall Security and quite frankly, I                   just bought my wife a new                            Cadillac, so let's just say it                       won't be me.

83) 3) dialog: How fucking stupid do you have to be?! I mean Dennis. What the fuck, Ronnie? How could you not have known it was Dennis? Then, how the fuck could you be so stupid as to let him get away. OBSERVE AND REPORT. Those are the only two things you have to do and you can't do those worth a shit.
83) 7) dialog: Go ahead.
83) 11) dialog: Just start talking, Ronnie!
83) 21) dialog: Good.   Because you're fired.
83) 26) dialog: I'm serious, Ronnie. I've always liked you, but there's just no excuse for this. Somebody is going down and I'll be damned if it's going to be me. Now, don't make a big thing out of this. Just pack your shit and get out by the end of the day.
83) 30) dialog: I'm not your friend, I'm your boss.
83) 53) dialog: No, Ronnie.

89) 78) dialog: Call the police. And go get                             Ronnie.                                                
89) 82) dialog: Just do what I ask you.
