In the  middle of the big flood last year, I  was patrolling the streets in a boat,  feeling kind of sorry for myself --  'cause it was my birthday and all --  when I saw the front door to a house  was open. I pulled my gun -- afraid  it might be looters. Imagine my  surprise when, instead of a looter,  I find a young woman handcuffed to  the railing of her stairs. Her name  was Karen, and ever since she came  back from college she'd made it clear  she was too good for any of us local  folk. Now here she was, in handcuffs!  I said, "What the heck is going on  here, ma'am?" And she said...
