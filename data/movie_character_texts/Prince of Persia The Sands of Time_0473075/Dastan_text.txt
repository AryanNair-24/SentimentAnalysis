Tamina watches, holding her breath. At last Dastan reaches the far wall. It’s sheer, not a handhold in sight. He gropes for one anyway. His hand SLI on the slick rock. Tamina can’t look... The chasm is too wide at this end for Dastan to jump back the opposite wall. Nevertheless, he braces his feet again the rock -- and LAUNCHES himself out into space. 85.

Dastan gazes in awe, experiencing the full religious impa Maybe there’s more to this than he thought... Dastan takes a deep breath and looks ahead; the second ha of the passageway is filled with even more black stones. Carefully, he hops between the increasingly scarce safe stones. To avoid getting stranded, he’s forced to start using the walls, clinging to them like a rockclimber. At last, the end of the black tiles comes into sight. Gritting his teeth, he PUSHES off the wall with his feet, JUMPS through the air, straining for distance-- 87. He’s not going to make it. Switching his landing to a div at the last instant, he hits the floor with both hands instead of his feet, tumbles-- and clears it! Exhaling with relief, he gets to his feet...
