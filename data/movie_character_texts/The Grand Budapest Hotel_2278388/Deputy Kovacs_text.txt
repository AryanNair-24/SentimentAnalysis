0) 262) dialog: This is Madame D’s Last Will and Testament. It consists of a general tontine drawn up before the event of her husband's death forty-six years ago -- Deputy Kovacs lifts a faded, fragile slip of paper out of the box. He places it delicately onto the table.
0) 263) dialog: -- in combination with 635 amendments, notations, corrections, and letters of wishes executed during the subsequent decades. Deputy Kovacs reaches into the box with two hands and pulls out an enormous pile of scraps, slips, shreds, slivers, forms, files, post-cards, and various bits of lint and loose thread. He plants it all down with a thud.
0) 264) dialog: The ultimate legality of this accumulation requires further analysis; but, in the opinion of this office, it was Madame D‘s intention that control of the vast bulk of her estate should be transferred, forthwith, to her son, Dmitri --

0) 271) dialog: An additional codicil, delivered into my possession by post only this morning and, by all indications, sent by Madame D. during the last hours of her life, contains an amendment to the original certificate, which, as prescribed by law, I will read to you now. The authenticity of this document has not yet been confirmed by the presiding magistrate, so I ask that all parties be patient and refrain from comment until such time as our investigations can be completed.

Gustave H, did arrive at the Desgoffe und Taxis residence in Lutz and enter by the rear service alley, alerting no one to his presence, and did then proceed by way of back-stairs and servants-passage, to deliver himself into the private chambers of Madame D. There is no evidence to indicate whether this visit had been pre- arranged with her or not. The next morning, Madame D. was found dead by strychnine poisoning. M. Gustave was not. observed on the premises again until,” of course, “twenty-four hours later.” The identity of his accusers is made clear in this notarized deposition. Deputy Kovacs produces another document which he hands to Zero. Zero studies it as Deputy Kovacs continues:

His whereabouts are (more) 48. DEPUTY KOVACS (cont'd) currently unknown, but he’s being sought and pursued by the relevant authorities.
0) 474) dialog: Something's missing. A crucial document, either misplaced or, conceivably, destroyed.

Agreed?

0) 644) text: A police report with a photograph of Deputy Kovacs’ body in a pharaoh’s casket with his hands crossed on his chest. A section at the bottom of the page is labelled FINGERPRINTS. There are five for the left hand, but only a thumb for the right. Jopling studies the document. He shrugs.
