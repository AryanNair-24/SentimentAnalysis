0) 648) dialog: Talk to his club-footed sister again -- and, this time: be persuasive. Dmitri hangs up. He crosses into the library and stands in front of a snooker table. The box containing Madame D’s will sits among billiard balls in the middle of it. Its contents have been spread-out and scattered into a sprawling mess. Marguerite, Laetizia, and Carolina play cards and sip at tiny glasses of port on the other end of the room. Dmitri drinks a vodka in one gulp. He shuffles and sifts among the scraps, preoccupied.

He watches Agatha pass. He watches Dmitri grimly pursuing her. He looks intrigued. Agatha bee-lines into the elevator. The elevator operator looks to her and waits. She hesitates. She names the top floor:

0) 811) dialog: (hesitates) I’m going to blast your candy-ass once and for all right now! Dmitri instantly leans down, lifts up his trouser leg, and draws a small-calibre hand-gun from a strap under his sock. He fires. M, Gustave and Zero throw their boxes in every direction and duck to the sides of the elevator. Dmitri fires again. Bullets ricochet. A door opens half-way down the corridor.
