LUDWIG (cont'd) sayin’ it’s a stroll down a tree-lined promenade with a fine lady and a white poodle, but it’s got what you'd call “vulnerability” -- and that’s our bread and butter. Take a look.

0) 434) dialog: You hit the nail on the head there, Mr. Gustave. We got fake documents, second- hand street clothes, and a rope-ladder made out of sticks and bunk-linens -- but we need diggin’ tools, and that’s provin’ hard to come by in this flop-house.

Gustave, Pinky, Giinther, and Ludwig work diligently by candle-light under a wooden table. Periodically, Wolf scoops-up the powdery debris with a soup ladle and throws it aside.

Feet creak along the thick, wooden floor outside the cell -- and come to a halt directly in front of the door. Silence. There is a loud but muffled sneeze. The feet begin to creak again and fade-away until they are inaudible. Ludwig signals to the others. They resume their tapping.

Gustave, Pinky, Giinther, Wolf, and Ludwig are all dressed like vagabonds already and carry various sacks and baskets. One-by-one, they disappear into the floor.
