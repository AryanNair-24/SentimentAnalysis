0) 694) dialog: Get on the next cable-car. The monk points. A cable-car is just arriving down the sloping line from an adjacent peak. M. Gustave hesitates. The monk urges him on with a brusque motion. M. Gustave and Zero sprint across the balcony, scramble down a flight of steps, and race out onto the boarding platform. A family of six waits in skiing costumes. They stare at M. Gustave and Zero as they arrive, breathless. A tramway operator holds open the door. Everyone boards, squeezing. 90.

Half-way there: the cable-car slams to a stop with a clunk. Everyone is startled. The stalled vehicle sways in the quiet wind. The father looks up. The mother looks down. The children look to each other. In the distance: there is a faint, mechanical hum. M. Gustave and Zero look out. Another cable-car is ascending at a diagonal on a different line. They all watch as it slowly approaches. Just as it is about to criss-cross their path: it slams to a stop, too. Another elderly, cloaked monk stares out from inside the other cable-car.

There is another clunk, and the two cable-cars resume their journeys. M. Gustave and Zero exchange a look. Their new cable-car continues up toward its destination. A sign above the arrival platform reads: Our Holy Father of the Sudetenwaltz. Directly below it, there is a walled fort with a steeple and a tall stone cross. Another tramway attendant holds the door open for them as they disembark. 91.

The echoing sound of a Gregorian chant begins to rise from all around. M. Gustave and Zero swiftly slip-on the cloaks just as a procession of a hundred monks enters from two directions, merges in the church-yard, and advances double-file toward the chapel. M. Gustave and Zero open their hymnals at random and slip into the procession.

They step up onto the pew, slink quickly in a crouch to the aisle, then hop down to the floor. Monks, watching them, frown. M. Gustave and Zero hurry together into the confessional booth and close the door.
