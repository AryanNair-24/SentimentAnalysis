3) 65) dialog: Women are different up close. I love Susie, but she’s a weirdo. She smells terrible when she’s anxious, and sometimes she gets mean as fuck for no reason. She’s a person. You haven’t written a person, you've written a girl.

6) 49) dialog: Calling your doctor. Calvin physically stops him.
6) 51) dialog: I certainly didn’t pretend I invented her, Calvin.
6) 54) dialog: Hasn't it occurred to you that she might be an imposter? (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
6) 57) dialog: 6/09/11 Draft That some girl maybe wanted to get close to you, and somehow got her hands on what you wrote, and--
6) 59) dialog: Okay. Let’s say you...created this person. Everything you wrote about her came true, right? Even the smallest things?
6) 61) dialog: Have you tried writing more?
6) 63) dialog: Write something about her.

6) 105) dialog: I bet. Calvin gets up.
6) 108) dialog: You can’t even imagine. 54 EXT. CALVIN’S HOUSE. JUST AFTER. 54 Ruby waves goodbye at the door. Calvin waves back. Harry stands next to him, waving.

6) 143) dialog: Yeah now, but what about in a couple months? Or days? Women are mysterious creatures. I still look at Susie and think “Who are you?” (CONTINUED)
6) 147) dialog: So you could make her do anything. For men everywhere: tell me you’re not going to let that go to waste. Calvin looks down the dark street, the LA skyline all lit in the distance. He looks back at Harry.
7) 52) dialog: Because she painted porn.
7) 54) dialog: In positions. It’s basically porn.
