0) 30) dialog: Also we'll need these podiums put on a riser as we agreed to in the pre-conditions. You're a few inches short and it makes it harder for the Governor to read his notes.

I don't care whether he leads in the polls...I don't care whether he has all the tools...Because the truth is, he's the only one that's going to make a difference in peoples lives...Even the people that hate him. If Mike Morris is President it says more about us than it does about him. I don't give a fuck if he can win. He has to win.
13) 5) dialog: I'll get it in a bit...
13) 17) dialog: Fucking kill me...where did we get this?
13) 21) dialog: Thank God it wasn't overseas. Just get rid of it -

13) 28) dialog: It's gonna come out but not paid for by us pal. (To Staffer) Any truth on whether Pullman had investments in those diamond mines in Liberia?
13) 39) dialog: Doesn't matter I want to hear him denying it. If it's true, find out, if it's not, let them spend the next day telling the post that he doesn't own a diamond mine in Liberia...win win.
13) 42) dialog: We need to counter this Christian shit we're taking from last night...so get going...Where's our cut on the new thirty and a sixty second spots? We'll show it to him this afternoon in the staff meeting.
13) 49) dialog: Oh, right. Thanks. I've been waiting for this.

15) 24) dialog: National service isn't polling like the rest of your domestic policy.
15) 27) dialog: Good cop, good cop.
15) 39) dialog: All of that is exactly right...Governor if you're going to do it...then do it. Don't make it voluntary...mandatory.
15) 43) dialog: Mandatory!...everyone who graduates high school or turns eighteen, gives two years to his or her country. Military...peace corps...plant fucking trees, I don't care...and for that...their college education is paid for...period.
15) 47) dialog: No sir you don't...do it all...all the way. Mandatory.
15) 50) dialog: And here's the beauty of it...everyone who is older than eighteen and past the age of eligibility, would be for it...create national pride...give all the kids an education.
15) 60) dialog: Can't vote. Too young. This sits with them. Some start to smile.

16) 26) dialog: I can't be talking to you...

18) 44) dialog: I know for a fact that Thompson is going with us.
18) 48) dialog: I can't do it.
18) 51) dialog: I've played dirty but I don't have to play dirty anymore...you know why? Cause I got Morris!

23) 108) dialog: Wow.
23) 117) dialog: No, not at all...I mean I kind of respect it in a weird sort of way.
23) 121) dialog: You have absolutely no idea how to tie a tie do you...
23) 125) dialog: You're very mature.
24) 2) dialog: When are you coming back?
24) 6) dialog: What happened with Thompson?
24) 9) dialog: I'm running some numbers now...I don't know...
24) 19) dialog: Yeah I'm on it...I gotta go.
25) 5) dialog: Yup...(Nope) Just trying to figure out our stops on the ground.
25) 9) dialog: We'll be fine...we have to do it...and it's the right thing. Nothing bad happens when it's the right thing.
25) 12) dialog: Well there are exceptions to every rule... They smile. The Governor looks at Stephen.
25) 16) dialog: Fine now.
25) 25) dialog: Great...
25) 29) dialog: I think we're solid.
25) 31) dialog: Governor there's a big difference between Paul and me. Paul only believes in winning so he'll do or say anything to win.
25) 34) dialog: I'll do or say anything if I believe in it...but I have to believe in the cause.
25) 37) dialog: Well I won't be out of this line of work as long as you're in it.
25) 40) dialog: Pimping out ex presidents...

27) 16) dialog: You were on a plane and he called me and he asked if we could meet...And I said why...he said it was very important so I did...but I should've fucking told you...
27) 19) dialog: Yes.
27) 22) dialog: -the gist of it is he wants to hire me. He wants me to jump ship and come work for him...this is bad Paul. He showed me poll numbers with Pullman ahead by four. We're in really deep fucking trouble he laid out their whole plan. Robo- calls, traffic jams, fake lit, and fucking Thompson. They promised him Secretary of State.
29) 4) dialog: Paul I'm sorry. Believe me...I just didn't think it was true.
29) 8) dialog: Please believe me that I honestly believed you were gonna come back and you were gonna tell me that we have Thompson in the bag and I didn't see the point. But it doesn't make it right and I'm sorry.
31) 4) dialog: Who do you want...
31) 8) dialog: A fund-raiser in Cleveland tonight.
31) 12) dialog: Will he go for it?

34) 3) dialog: (On the phone) Do we have any other senators that can go to bat for us? House members won't do.

34) 19) dialog: Fuck...Jess, I'll call you back... (To Molly) All of them? Goddamit!
34) 22) dialog: They're not gonna tell a pollster that they're gonna vote Democratic...I don't even know how to read these polls.
34) 26) dialog: We don't need the fucking vans...we just don't want Pullman to have them...
37) 23) dialog: 
37) 25) dialog: I'm on it.
38) 3) dialog: What time is this on tonight?
38) 6) dialog: How'd he do?

42) 17) dialog: I thought it was mine. Who was it?
42) 19) dialog: One of the other interns drunk dialing you?
42) 31) dialog: Hold on...
42) 35) dialog: I'm gonna call him back.
42) 39) dialog: ...And I'm gonna tell him that I'm your dad...

47) 22) dialog: Who?
47) 25) dialog: Where are you?
48) 4) dialog: Did Duffy tell you this?
48) 15) dialog: You're supposed to be my friend Ida. You'd stab me in the back like this? You'd ruin my reputation just so you-
48) 18) dialog: I've given you everything -every fucking scoop, your profile with Pau1....
48) 20) dialog: Go fuck yourself.

49) 10) dialog: Don't bullshit me Tom.
49) 14) dialog: I just spoke with Ida Horowicz.
49) 17) dialog: She's threatening to release the story.
49) 21) dialog: That we met! That I fuckin met with you!
49) 31) dialog: Don't play dumb here Tom.
49) 34) dialog: Who else?
49) 37) dialog: Well I know I didn't, so that leaves you.
49) 39) dialog: She knows whatever you told her.
49) 42) dialog: Well too late.
49) 45) dialog: She knows where we met, she knows when we met... she knows you had buffalo fucking wings.
49) 48) dialog: Yes she has a source.
49) 52) dialog: Yeah, you.
49) 62) dialog: Did you tell anyone?
49) 65) dialog: No.
49) 67) dialog: No.
49) 71) dialog: She's gonna take the story to Drudge, or Roll Call...shit like that.
49) 74) dialog: She's trying to blackmail me - wants info about Thompson.
49) 77) dialog: I can't do that.
49) 80) dialog: I'm not gonna be blackmailed Tom.
49) 88) dialog: If I tell her about Thompson I gotta tell her he's gonna endorse you guys.
49) 91) dialog: No fucking way. Paul told her we had Thompson in the bag. It'll make us look like fools.
49) 93) dialog: I can't do it.
49) 99) dialog: I Gotta go.

50) 25) dialog: Right.
50) 28) dialog: I would hope not.
50) 32) dialog: You fucked up, Molly...
50) 43) dialog: But I have a responsibility to him... and more importantly I have a responsibility to this campaign.
50) 45) dialog: Molly you've go to wake the fuck up... this is the big leagues... it's mean...and when you make mistakes you lose your right to play. Make the appointment and tell me when and where we have to go. He exits.

56) 12) dialog: How'd he take it?
56) 15) dialog: Paul-I gotta tell you something.
56) 18) dialog: Ida knows I met with Duffy. PAUL stares at him blankly.
56) 20) dialog: I don't know how she found out. Tried to blackmail me. Said she was gonna let the story out if I didn't tell her what happened at your meeting with Thompson.
56) 24) dialog: Probably. Yeah. Whoever she takes it to, they're gonna call me for a statement.
56) 31) dialog: I could just deny the whole thing, but if they call Duffy and he admits to it, that could look worse. If I say no comment they won't let up.
56) 36) dialog: I don't understand.
56) 39) dialog: Paul...they're gonna print that story in the paper tomorrow morning.
56) 41) dialog: But why? Why would you do that to me? Why would you do that to the campaign.
56) 44) dialog: Then why would you do that to me?
56) 47) dialog: What?
56) 49) dialog: I made a mistake - a stupid mistake.
56) 57) dialog: I didn't think it was important.
56) 67) dialog: Well it really isn't whether you trust me, it's whether the Governor does.
56) 71) dialog: He does.
61) 0) text: STEPHEN drives by the clinic, he slows to see if Molly is still there. The clinic is closed.
64) 0) text: STEPHEN enters the offices, staffers look up and recogniz him.
64) 1) dialog: Where's Duffy...
64) 18) dialog: I'm in. I'm coming to work for you.
64) 22) dialog: I know who leaked it.
64) 26) dialog: Paul.
64) 30) dialog: Yeah. I told him we met. He leaked it.
64) 32) dialog: I felt like I should.
64) 36) dialog: Obviously.
64) 39) dialog: I quit.
64) 41) dialog: I quit! And I can give you everything on Morris. Everything.
64) 48) dialog: I can lay out his whole strategy for you.
64) 52) dialog: What if I had something else?
64) 56) dialog: Yeah.
64) 59) dialog: 
64) 63) dialog: What if I had something big?
64) 66) dialog: Something big. Something that'll bring Morris down.
64) 75) dialog: (Shaking his head) Give me the job.
64) 81) dialog: Politics is my life.
64) 84) dialog: Like you?
64) 87) dialog: You knew I was gonna tell Paul.
64) 91) dialog: You knew if I told him he'd fire me.

72) 4) dialog: Does it seem that way?
72) 12) dialog: What's say I do the talking and you do the listening.
72) 15) dialog: As of tomorrow morning there's going to be some changes in your campaign. Paul is out. I will be your senior campaign manager. I'll draft a statement, "we're at a point in the campaign where some changes have to be made etc." You can put your own words in there, you do it better than most.
72) 19) dialog: Because you want to win. Because you broke the only rule in politics. You want to be President, you can start a war, you can lie, you can cheat, you can bankrupt the country, but you can't fuck the interns...they'll get you for that.
72) 23) dialog: A troubled young pregnant girl...
