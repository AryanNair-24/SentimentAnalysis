9) 0) text: PAUL ZARA - Morris's campaign manager - is waiting in the wings off stage. STEPHEN sidles up next to him.
9) 10) dialog: A double?
9) 13) dialog: Fucking national security. The GOVERNOR looks off stage to PAUL and STEPHEN for approval.
9) 15) dialog: Outta the park.
9) 21) dialog: Well, we know they've nominated jackasses before.
9) 26) dialog: You always had the brains Duffy, but me - I always had the balls.
9) 36) dialog: What a prick.
10) 0) text: Stephen, Paul, Ida, and Ben are having drinks around a ta The mood is festive. There is a piano player playing, singing.
10) 4) dialog: Ha-ha.
10) 7) dialog: What do you think Stevie?
10) 10) dialog: Ben?
10) 14) dialog: What do you think Ida?
10) 18) dialog: You tell me and I'll tell you.
10) 27) dialog: Eke?
10) 29) dialog: You see, she's trying to get under my skin.
10) 32) dialog: Us by nine.
10) 37) dialog: Certain? No. Confident? Yes.
10) 40) dialog: And I think we will, but I won't tell you it's a sure thing. Fucking Saint Gabriel can blow his horn on election day and get his four horseman to rig the ballot boxes for Pullman and it wouldn't surprise me. Don't get me wrong. Six presidentials I've done and I've never felt this good. But am I gonna sit here and say "Yes -we will definitely win Ohio"? Not a chance. In the last thirty years seventy-three Democrats have run for president. How many have won? Three.
10) 47) dialog: That means seventy guys ran who thought they had a chance, and they all lost.
10) 51) dialog: Don't twist my words. What I'm saying is that I'm not going to promise we'll win. But he's decorated by Bush Senior from the first Gulf war and protested the second. He left his state with a balanced budget and the fourth highest education rate. The Republicans have nobody out there that can touch this guy...so for this moment, this election, this primary is the presidential. And that Ida, is the state of the union. And on that note, I'm gonna take a shit. PAUL swigs down the rest of his drink and exits.
11) 2) dialog: This is off off off the record.
11) 5) dialog: Franklin Thompson.
11) 8) dialog: Off the record. The only people who know are the Governor, Stephen and me.
11) 11) dialog: I have a meeting tomorrow at Thompson's house.
11) 14) dialog: After I'm done talking with him, what do you think?
11) 17) dialog: It's more than huge. He has 356 pledged delegates...they all travel with him. That puts us over the top.
11) 26) dialog: That's what they all say until we get them alone in a room.
11) 30) dialog: Yup. It's just about in the bag.
11) 34) dialog: Nope. That's all you get for now.
14) 4) dialog: That Pullman's negatives are high...mid forties. Senator we have an open seat in the White House and the Republicans don't have dick. They're disorganized and they can't find a nominee that isn't a world class fuck up. They look like Democrats. No Republican is gonna show up to vote for their guy. But if Pullman gets the Democratic nod they'll show up to vote against him.
14) 7) dialog: I sure do. Senator...I'm a bit confused...we need your delegates...we need you...your fund raising. It was my understanding that...your endorsement a week before Ohio...would win this for us...
15) 0) text: We're in a staff meeting with the brain trust. Paul's gon but the rest are there...STEPHEN, BEN, GOVERNOR MORRIS. MOLLY is running in and out, she gets glances from all th guys.
24) 0) text: We Intercut with PAUL driving.
24) 4) dialog: I'll be at the event...a little late...these cock suckers...fucking dirty shit.
24) 8) dialog: Nothing, the prick...we had him all sewed up...MOTHER FUCKER...how bad is it?
24) 18) dialog: Alright, I'll be there in three hours...I want hard numbers...and a strategy.
27) 3) dialog: Whoa...
27) 12) dialog: -Slow down.
27) 15) dialog: What?
27) 17) dialog: Stop Stop let me get this straight. You met with Tom Duffy?
27) 21) dialog: What'd he want Stephen?
29) 2) dialog: If this is some sort of practical-I mean -my fucking blood pressure is going through the roof right now.
29) 6) dialog: It doesn't fucking matter what you thought. It matters what you did. It matters what you didn't do. If all this shit is true I made a fucking ass of myself at Thompson's place. And I gave away our game plan.
29) 10) dialog: Let me think...let me think...
31) 2) dialog: We get the Governor right after he finishes singing Kum Bay Ya and give him everything we know.
31) 6) dialog: You, me and the Governor, that's it! What's he got after?
31) 10) dialog: He'll be late...we're gonna tell him that if he doesn't offer Thompson a cabinet position...he's not gonna get the nomination.
31) 13) dialog: I don't fucking know Stephen.
31) 15) dialog: Find us a room...
33) 12) dialog: Who the fuck knows Governor...but we can't take the chance...
33) 15) dialog: I think we fold up the campaign in Ohio...take a loss and blame it on the Republican's playing games...head to North Carolina.
33) 18) dialog: Not if you get Thompson's endorsement.
33) 35) dialog: Governor, if you lose Ohio, and they get Thompson's delegates...Then they get North Carolina...then they get the lead. A lead you can't beat. But if we walk from Ohio, take Thompson, give him a cabinet post, then we take North Carolina. His state. Then Pennsylvania. Your state. And then it's simple math Mike. Take his endorsement and the race is over.
34) 29) dialog: No, No that's not what I'm saying...we were the underdog before we got into this and we continue to be the underdog...well the numbers...we knew the numbers would get closer the closer we got to Tuesday...I'm not lowering expectations...have you ever heard me say that we had Ohio locked?... Then at least give me the courtesy of printing that in your column.
37) 20) dialog: 
56) 0) text: We're in PAUL'S room. He's lying on the bed, talking on h cell phone.
56) 8) dialog: Absolutely -there's no question about it ....
56) 11) dialog: But we've got to think broader strokes here, rethink everything....uh-huh....Yeah, I know how to handle it....Look,Stevie just got here. Can I call you back in a few minutes? ..Okay, bye. (He hangs up) The Governor. We had a good long talk on the way back. He's up to speed with everything.
56) 14) dialog: Better than I thought he would. Still won't take Thompson's endorsement.
56) 16) dialog: What's up?
56) 22) dialog: So it's gonna hit the papers.
56) 32) dialog: I leaked it to Ida. Pause.
56) 35) dialog: At the event.
56) 37) dialog: We made a deal.
56) 40) dialog: I know.
56) 42) dialog: The campaign will survive.
56) 45) dialog: Makes it easier to let you go.
56) 48) dialog: Why'd you meet with Duffy?
56) 56) dialog: No Stephen. You didn't make a mistake. You made a choice. You called me and left a message to call back...that it was important. But when I did...you said to forget about it. You chose not to tell me. Why did you make that choice?
56) 59) dialog: Sure you did. But you went because you were curious, because you were flattered. Because it made you feel special to think Duffy wanted to speak to you instead of me. Because you thought to yourself: maybe I can get something out of this. Because it made you feel big. First campaign I ran tiny little race in Kentucky -state senate seat. Workin for redneck nobody named McGuthrie. Had no money, no staff, no fuckin office. Everyone thought we didn't stand a chance. There's no way we can compete. And about this time, a guy running a congressional campaign a few districts over gives me a call. Says, "I really like what you were able to do for poor ole' Sam. But let's face it, he's a goner, so why don't you come work for me?" What do I do? Well Stephen -this is where you and I are different. I told Sam about the call. And Sam says to me, "Paul, you think this other's guy's got a shot at winning, and he can pay you more than anything I can afford, so if it's what you feel you need to do, then I won't get in your way." So I say, "Sam -you took a chance and hired me when I was even more of nobody than you are, and I'd be damned if I'm gonna jump ship just because the shit hit the fan." We lost the race, but three years later, when Sam decided to run for Governor -who do you think he called? We won that race.
56) 65) dialog: And twenty years later I'm where I am now. (Beat) There's only one thing I value in this world Steve, and that's loyalty. Without it you're nothing and you have no one. And in politics it's the only currency that you can count on. That's why I'm letting you go. Not because you're not good enough. But I value trust over skill. And I don't trust you anymore.
56) 69) dialog: The Governor knows, he thinks it's the right thing to do.
56) 73) dialog: If I were you? I'd get a good night sleep because you're gonna get fucking pounded by calls from the press in the morning... Off of Stephen we:
69) 22) dialog: She'd only been on the road with us for a few weeks...maybe four I think, I can check.
69) 32) dialog: We will most certainly stay on schedule. This accident, and we have to assume for now it's an accident, is just simply a tragedy. The work, the schedule won't be altered. It just means that those of us that knew Molly will go about our jobs with a heavy heart.
76) 6) dialog: The Governor and I both felt, that in light of some of these changing numbers, it was best to put a new face on the campaign...Stephen is very talented...very smart...
79) 3) dialog: You should hire Jack for a speech writer.
79) 13) dialog: No. I'm friends with the family. I got her the internship...known her since she was born.
79) 16) dialog: The Governor couldn't make the flight?
79) 19) dialog: Look at you, all grown up with tits and all.
79) 22) dialog: One day we'll grab a beer and you'll tell me what you had on the Governor that put me out.
79) 25) dialog: You better get going, you've got a campaign to run and I've got offices to go look at.
79) 29) dialog: Nice consultant firm right off of K Street. Paul turns to leave.
79) 30) dialog: A million a year and nobody to fuck you over.
79) 40) dialog: Doesn't it.
