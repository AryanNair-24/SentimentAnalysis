9) 1) dialog: Knowing that I could be assassinated at any moment, I feel it's important that some people should understand my thoughts.

12) 7) dialog: No. This is just... plain old me.
12) 9) dialog: I'm just discreet. I know a lot of people here. If they found out, I could lose my job.
12) 16) dialog: I need a change.

18) 8) dialog: One more minute! (back to his new scheme) I'll go to the neighborhood banks. They must have some gay customers.
18) 10) dialog: I'm a businessman, Scott. I think businesses ought to treat their customers right. Even their gay customers. For God's sake, this is San Francisco!
18) 12) dialog: We should have at least one block in one city right? Start there and take over the neighborhood. (a smile) Okay, you can come in now! Scott heads toward the kitchen. The table is LAID OUT wit home-cooked meal, CANDLES and a huge bouquet of FLOWERS.

19) 12) dialog: No. No. Just a joke. Mr. McConnelly here loves our kind. Spend away! (to McConnelly) Tell your wife Hello for me. Harvey spots Scott in the crowd and PULLS HIM TOWARD HIM, KISSING HIM ON THE MOUTH. It's quite the show. They step back out onto the street where an Irish band is now playi Gay men watch. Some clap. Harvey grabs Scott and spins hi through a sharp waltz. OFF the pair at home in their new neighborhood.
20) 1) dialog: And people started hanging around our store. Not customers. Activists, kids, folks who needed a home away from home...
22) 0) text: A FEW YOUNG MEN are hanging out in the shop, the beginnin of Harvey's entourage. Harvey moves among them, sharing a clipped Sunday cartoon, lecturing them on politics or the arts, and checking out the cute ones.

22) 3) dialog: What you're not getting is the spectacle of it, the bigger than life emotions... Danny jumps up and IMITATES the LARGER THAN LIFE GESTURES an opera diva, making Harvey laugh.
22) 9) dialog: Jim Rivaldo. A great mind. A great wit. A Harvard graduate, which nobody cared about, in those days, in the Castro... including himself. JIM RIVALDO flops down into the vintage dental chair that sits in front of Harvey's desk. He seems to be looking fo something to occupy his keen mind. A sharply dressed youn man, 20s, DICK PABICH, walks up to peek over his shoulder

22) 15) dialog: Everyone, this is Allan Baird. He's a very big deal, so behave yourselves.
22) 22) dialog: I do have friends in awfully low places, but just so you know, it's not official yet.
22) 24) dialog: The Mayor part. I've considered gathering an army of queers to march up to City Hall and secede, but so far the young gays seem more interested in jeeps and jeans. But if I could be of any use, I'm all ears!
22) 26) dialog: I'm just curious. Are we your first stop or your last?
22) 28) dialog: Well, you seem to have noticed that my kind of people drink a lot of beer. If we're going to fast for your sake, I think we should get to deliver some of it when you win this fight, don't you?
22) 31) dialog: And allies. I'll have Coors out of every bar in the Castro by the end of the week. Deal?
22) 38) dialog: No more Coors beer. It's gotta come out of every bar. Gay and straight.
22) 40) dialog: Nothing for me. That's a convert.
22) 42) dialog: The cause.
23) 1) dialog: I got "my people" to get Coors out of all the Gay Bars. 30 million bottles worth in San Francisco alone. Coors beer immediately fell from number 1. They caved. One week later, union man Allan Baird hired the first ever openly gay union boys to drive Teamsters trucks... We weren't just a group of pansies anymore. We had a neighborhood. We had the unions. And for the first time, we had a little bit of power.
24) 1) dialog: Maybe that was the day someone first called me the "Mayor" of Castro Street. (a knowing grin) Or perhaps I invented it myself.

27) 3) dialog: (HALF-JOKING)
27) 12) dialog: Politics is theater. It doesn't matter if you win. You make a statement. You say, "I'm here, pay attention to me."
27) 14) dialog: Coors looks like it might cave. The union boys will owe me. Imagine if we get their vote... It'll be fun!
27) 16) dialog: We'll make it a spectacle.
28) 0) text: Harvey walks down to Market St. with a box. He waves, sha flirts with everyone. His warmest hello is from a gruff U MAN. Behind Harvey, Scott pushes a loaded shopping cart.

28) 1) dialog: A week ago, Police officers came into our area with covered up badges and sent fourteen of our people to the hospitals, and to jail. The charges, "Blocking a Sidewalk."

30) 5) dialog: Where's home?
30) 7) dialog: I'm Harvey Milk. I'm running for Supervisor. What's your name?
30) 14) dialog: Well Mr. Jones, we should walk up to my camera shop and register you.
30) 16) dialog: Is that right? Do you trick up on Polk Street?
30) 18) dialog: Tell me one thing before you get back to work then. What was it like to be a little queer in Phoenix?
30) 20) dialog: Sometimes. But what I'm saying is, Phoenix can change. But we have to start with our street: rent control, police abuse, pot, parks, seniors.
30) 22) dialog: You know what I think, Cleve Jones?
30) 24) dialog: No. That you need to do what you're good at. Be a prick. Fight City Hall. Fight the cops. Fight the people who made you come here to do what you do.
30) 31) dialog: I didn't come out until very late in life. There was nobody to--
31) 1) dialog: --look up to, no hope for a better life. Those that did were outcast... arrested.. suicide. And the young ones, who did escape home... and who arrive in San Francisco, and then what...
32) 3) dialog: He used to come into my shop. Are there any witnesses?
32) 5) dialog: Jerry wasn't a trick. They were lovers.

33) 15) dialog: (to Jim) So who are these so-called "gay leaders?" And who appointed them? And what are you suggesting, Jim, that I'm supposed to go and solicit their endorsement?

34) 9) dialog: They probably wrote it. (off Scott's anxiety) Hey, If somebody tries to kill me, I'll get the sympathy vote, right? Could be just the push we need.
34) 11) dialog: It's a complete joke. No rhythm. No humor. It's insulting. CLOSE ON THE LETTER: Someone has drawn a STICK FIGURE of Harvey being tortured - bullets, knives, fire, etc. Harve makes a DECISION: He sticks the DRAWING to the refrigerat the first thing he'll see in the morning.
34) 13) dialog: If you put it away, hide it in a drawer, it'll just get bigger and scarier. Now it's there. We'll see it every day. It can't get us.

36) 2) dialog: Endorsing straight candidates is what you think is best to help us?
36) 6) dialog: But I am running for office. I'm on the ballot. I have the union rank and file, the seniors, and I could use your magazine's endorsement.
36) 13) dialog: And why haven't you run?
36) 17) dialog: The cops come into our neighborhood and beat us. They turn a blind eye if one of us is murdered.
36) 19) dialog: There are no real gay allies. Yes, our friends may sense our struggle, but they can't feel it. It's not life or death for them. We need our own in office.
36) 21) dialog: Why not? How can we ask them to respect us if we don't show ourselves some self respect, David.
36) 28) dialog: Go back into the closet? Is that what you're saying? Because I know the closet. I lived in it for more years than I care to remember. (rising to go) I don't need your endorsement. I'm not asking anyone for acceptance. I don't have time to ask.
36) 30) dialog: I'm not a candidate, I'm part of a movement. The movement is the candidate. There's a difference. You don't see the difference. But I do.

40) 0) text: It's a firestorm of words as Harvey debates Art Agnos.
40) 1) dialog: It's a racket. It's 1976 and you still have to be straight, white, Catholic and male to get into the San Francisco police force. It's Racist. Homophobic.
40) 3) dialog: You're right, Art. And many are your closest friends. You see, I don't think State Assembly seats should be awarded on the basis of service to the Democrat Machine. Machines operate on oil and grease. They're dirty, dehumanizing, and too often unresponsive to any needs but those of the operator.
40) 5) dialog: Tell me Mr. Agnos... right here in the Castro, Robert Hillsbourough was murdered for walking home with his long time partner. Stabbed, (MORE)
