12) 3) dialog: There are two possibilities.  One.   The person who wrote this book is  your murderer and acted out the  killing described in ritualistic,  literal detail.  Two.  Someone who  wants to do the person who wrote  this book harm read the book and  enacted the killing described to  incriminate the writer.
12) 5) dialog: You're dealing with a devious,  diabolical mind.  This book must  have been written at least six  months, maybe years before it was  published.  That means the writer  planned the crime, at least in the  subconscious, back then.  The fact  that the writer carried it out  indicates psychopathic obsessive  behavior in terms not only of the  killing itself but in terms of  applied advance defense mechanism.
12) 10) dialog: Correct.
12) 14) dialog: You're dealing then with someone  so obsessed that he or she is  willing to kill an irrelevant and  innocent victim to place the blame  on the person who wrote this book.   We are talking about deep-seated,  obsessional hatred; an utter lack  of sense of proportion or  perspective.
12) 16) dialog: You're dealing with someone very  dangerous and very ill.
