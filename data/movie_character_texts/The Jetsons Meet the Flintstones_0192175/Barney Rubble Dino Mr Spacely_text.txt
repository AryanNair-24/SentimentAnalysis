5) 8) dialog: Nice morning, huh, Fred?
5) 10) dialog: Heh, hey. That Arnold's got a real arm on him, don't he?
5) 11) text: Now we see that Barney is holding the flamingo's stiff legs which he scissors, making the bird's beak trim the hedge.
5) 13) dialog: Ah, well, that appliance store and me, we kinda had a little adjustment --
5) 18) dialog: Fred, don't start on me again.    I donno, I'm just not a nine to five guy. I got dreams, Fred. Ideas --
5) 20) dialog: I invented fire.
5) 22) dialog: I told you that, Fred. But the coal conglomerate ripped me off. The case is still in court, but meanwhile I got lotsa other ideas --
5) 26) dialog: Maybe, Fred.   But first...
5) 28) dialog: Let me try some of that smoke on your car.
6) 0) text: We can still see Fred's car in the neighboring driveway. (We can also see Dino, who drags the newspaper on a bit more, then collapses from exhaustion). Barney's garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and ends, plus various inventions and scale models in different stages of completion. (Interestingly, a number of these anticipate Leonardo da Vinci's work). Many of the models are made of a strange celadon green material. Fred watches, skeptical, as Barney presses the car hood into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone.
6) 1) dialog: (as he works)
6) 3) dialog: -- Add some lava granules... some woca leaves... juice from two coo-coo berries...
6) 5) text: Two coo-coo berries?   You made of money, Barney?
6) 6) dialog: Anything for a pal, Fred -- a lump of coal... bamboo sawdust... eucalyptus sap... a touch of the La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila. Barney dips a finger in this mess, "tastes" it; satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out of his skin.
7) 0) text: Fred and Barney drive along. (Behind them, the same houses and palms seem to be going by... duplex, palm... split level, two palms... duplex, palm). Barney grins, gestures towards the front of the car.
7) 1) dialog: Not bad, eh? After it cures for an hour or so, it's solid as a rock.
7) 3) dialog: Did I ever?
7) 8) dialog: You're a big man anywhere, Fred --
7) 12) text: Barney looks glum, doesn't say anything.    Suddenly Fred pulls over, stops the car.
7) 15) dialog: Hey.   Lava Lane.
7) 17) dialog: (wistful) Yeah, those were the days... we usta dream about coming back here some day with a real car and goin' for the goldrock...!
7) 22) dialog: Fred... I thought you said it was time to retire those old dreams.
7) 27) dialog: (spotting the cops) Oh-oh! Fred, slow down -- !
7) 28) text: Suddenly both Fred and Barney see the RADAR BIRD flying alongside them. It checks its stopwatch, writes a note to itself. Fred is so preoccupied he doesn't notice as --
11) 0) text: Clouds of dust rise from behind the fence. We see the heads of the heavy equipment dinos rising and falling. A two-story office building is at one end of the site with a big "Slate Construction Inc." sign on the roof. CAMERA ADJUSTS as Fred's car turns into the lot, Barney seated beside Fred. The new green hood gleams in the morning light.
11) 1) text: Fred digs his feet into the ground, slams to a halt. He gets out, surveys the activity. Immediately, the various workers shout AD LIB greetings. Fred acknowledges these, beaming in the respect he gets here. He lovingly dusts off his construction helmet, puts it on knocks an offending speck from his parking sign (F. Flintstone - Shop Steward). He leads Barney towards the quarry area.
11) 14) text: No problem. Fred smiles at her, hands the forms to Barney. Fres steps towards the quarry, admires the activity, hands on hips, master of all he surveys. He waves to more friends.
11) 16) dialog: Gee, Fred. I knew you were a big shot. I just didn't know how big. Fred beams at that, and then follows Barney's gaze to the read-out on the truck scale. Fred is standing on it and it's pushing 250. With a scowl, Fred grabs Barney's sleeve and they go into the quarry. As they move, the CAMERA PANS and CRANES UP TOWARDS the window of the Slate Construction Office.
13) 0) text: Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving. Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them, we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the quarry's sides. BARNEY (to himself)
13) 6) text: Piltdown's compact buddy PYRITE cackles, sweeps  up the walnuts. Munching them, he balances a new one   in place. (It should be noted here that the relationship  and physi cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors  that of our heroes... they're sort of an anti-Fred and  Barney.) PYRITE
13) 26) text: -- Barney, hold me back -- Quickly the men form a circle around Piltdown and Fred. Barney looks up and sees --
13) 29) dialog: Hey, maybe you guys oughta fix that first.
13) 34) dialog: It looks dangerous. Besides, you can kick Fred's fat butt anytime.
14) 15) text: Barney scrambles up Fred's back, shoving a foot in Fred's face, but finally snatching the rope. He pulls on it... Fred throws his own weight into the effort...
17) 2) text: I'm over here, you moron -- and don't call me 'Uncle'! Slate's eyes fall on Fred's car hood, swinging from a bookshelf. He reaches for it -- pulls it -- it stays put, and only releases a new deluge of rubble and plaster which reburies him. At the same time, the door slams open and Fred, Barney and the other workers tumble inside
17) 7) dialog: Hey, nice going, Fred.   You even got the spare --
17) 16) dialog: That's a lie, Mr. Slate!
17) 21) dialog: (pointing to his forms) B. Rubble. White male personal reference --
17) 30) dialog: Well, actually, Fred, it was the other way ar--
17) 35) dialog: (reluctant) Sure, Fred, right, right.
17) 43) dialog: (sotto) Fibrerock, Fred...
17) 52) text: Slate takes the piece of material, leans it on the table so it catches the light. Despite himself, Lava comes over, examines the car hood... can't help but marvel at it as well. Meanwhile, Slate puts his arms around Fred and Barney.
17) 54) dialog: Gee, thanks, Mr. Slate.
17) 55) text: Lava glowers. Slate pulls Fred and Barney close with genuine excitement.
17) 57) text: He points to the translucent material. CAMERA TIGHTENS ON it. We see Fred, Barney and Slate's reflections in it.
19) 0) text: They're cruising along. Fred puffs on a cigar. Barney flips the pile of legal sized tablets in his lap. In the back seat are some boxes and bundles.
19) 1) dialog: Gee, Fred, I don't believe it. Eight hours ago I didn't have a job and now look -- I got 1/2 of one percent of the after-taxes after-expenses net breakage profits on Fibrerock!
19) 3) dialog: No, Fred, you weren't. I didn't nose any grindstones and you didn't shoulder a wheel. We just hung out together and everything that happened was a total accident.
20) 21) text: Suddenly the door bursts open.     Fred and Barney run in with candy and flowers.
20) 28) dialog: (presenting flowers) Betty, these are for you. For sticking beside me during the tough times, and well... for making a little guy feel like he was ten feet tall.
20) 30) dialog: Hey. Fred does something stupid every day and I still love him.
20) 31) text: Fred laughs good naturedly, grabs Barney in a headlock.
20) 41) text: She closes her eyes, swings the enrollment forms over on the table so that Fred and Barney can read them. Fred and Barney look at them, look at each other... and yawn.
20) 45) dialog: Plenty more where that came from.
20) 55) text: Barney squeezes back.
20) 56) dialog: Yeah. And nothing's ever gonna change that... right, Fred?
22) 10) text: Barney stands, acknowledges his friends and Lodge brothers.
22) 11) dialog: Indeed we do, Brother Herdmaster. Tonight we are to hear speeches from prospective candidates for Lodge offices, such as good old Fred and some other guys.
22) 20) dialog: (rising) My apologies, Brother Piltdown. Allow me to rephrase. Tonight we will hear speeches from a whole bunch of good old guys... (pause) ... plus the one and only Fred Flintstone!
22) 22) text: Barney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant. He tacks it to the wall, yanks a string. It unrolls. It's a big "VOTE FOR FRED FLINTSTONE" poster. Barney turns, gives Fred a "thumbs up," and as he does, Barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his pocket. Barney pushes his way through the seats, catches up to Fred and hands him the document. Fred takes it, continues up to the podium. There, the Herdmaster hands Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each other like a Pharaoh's badges of office. Fred does a Papal-like wave with these, sets them down, and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him.
22) 24) dialog: (hissing) -- crucible --
23) 0) text: WIDEN as Barney propels   a bowling ball (stone, of cours rumbling down the alley,   sending pins flying. The Buffaloes cheer Barney's   strike. We notice that most (i not all) of these Lodge   members also work at the quarry
23) 5) dialog: Thanks, Fred, but here at the lodge drinks are free.
23) 24) text: Anybody else got a toast...? BARNEY
23) 40) dialog: tugs Fred's sleeve, pulls him close. BARNEY
23) 42) text: Barney, it's all part of the plan. (to the others)
23) 43) text: Yes, boys, you see, I went up to my pal, Mister Slate and single- handedly made him an offer he couldn't refuse -- (Barney reacts to the "single-handedly" --) FRED
23) 44) text: -- 'Freddy boy,' he sez to me, 'We gotta talk turkey -- ' BARNEY
23) 46) text: That's right -- just like that -- BARNEY
23) 47) text: Fred -- ! Fred realizes Barney's got something on his mind. FRED
23) 50) text: Fred pulls Barney into a quiet corridor. They stand near a trophy case. There's some bowling trophies here with a variety of names on them. (There's also trophies for "pie-eating contests" and "beer drinking chug-offs"; these have only Fred's name on them.)
23) 51) dialog: Fred... what's this single-handed stuff? I distinctly remember at least four hands and two of them were mine.
23) 53) text: Barney, we could tell everyone how you invented this Fibrerock stuff, how Slate and Lava found out about it by accident and all, but what would that be?
23) 54) dialog: The truth?
23) 56) dialog: Okay.
23) 59) dialog: I never knew that.
23) 66) dialog: I get it. I got the brains, but you just pretend to have them.
24) 0) text: Barney comes out of his front door, heads toward the neighboring driveway and Fred's car. Betty comes out, calls to her husband.
24) 4) dialog: Thanks, Betty. What would I do without you?
24) 9) dialog: Come on, Betty, it's only my first day. You have to have seniority to run off...
24) 26) dialog: Yes, yes. Looking good, Mister Flintstone. I see you've recovered from that polo accident.
25) 0) text: Fred and Barney appear in Fred's car, make a very quick turn into the quarry lot.
25) 5) dialog: (when he's gone) Gee, Fred, driving with you is better than an 'E' ticket at Magerock Mountain.
25) 9) dialog: Oh, hi, Mister Lava.
25) 15) dialog: But, Fred, it's right where the employee basketball court used ta be --
25) 20) dialog: I guess so.   You already did.
25) 23) text: He goes off.    Fred and Barney go --
25) 26) dialog: All-right!
25) 34) dialog: Ready... aim... fibre!
25) 35) text: Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough.     "Fibrefoa pours into the mold.
25) 43) text: Fred and Barney, weary, approach each other, shake hands as they view the day's incredible output. Other weary, but proud workers gather around them: Mr. Slate is about to address them from his office balcony.
25) 58) dialog: Fred. You gotta do something about this!
25) 61) dialog: (proudly) That's my Fred...
27) 6) dialog: (worried) Fred?
29) 9) dialog: They're mad at you, Fred... it's understandable, I mean, they all got laid off today --
29) 12) dialog: Is that a riddle? Give me a second --
29) 25) text: Fred grabs Barney by the shoulder, spins him around, pushes him forward like a refrigerator on a dolly, stands him up center stage.
29) 27) text: The room quiets.    Barney clears his throat.     Fred wa hopeful.
29) 28) dialog: Well, there's not much to tell. (trying to remember Fred's phraseology) True, I got a cut... but Fred's got a gut.
29) 30) dialog: Oh, yeah, I remember! I got the mind, but Fred's got the behind. Right, Fred?
29) 31) text: Barney turns, gives Fred a big wink.    Fred groans.
29) 41) text: Fred snorts, sounding like Herb Alpert's lonely bull. Even under his furry fez we see him "looking around" desperately, hoping to hear one more snort. He kind of sneaks in one more forlorn grunt which fades away... finally, as Fred squirms miserably, there is one more lonely snort... ... from Barney, of course.
29) 47) dialog: I voted for you, Fred.
29) 49) text: Barney reacts, really hurt. He moves away on the bench. Fred's so agitated he doesn't even realize it.
29) 60) dialog: Fred! Fred! The Buffalo are heading for big trouble -- !
29) 62) dialog: No, no, not that! Piltdown's got the guys all worked up and they're heading down to the quarry! They're gonna wreck the assembly line!
29) 64) dialog: No, Fred, if they do that they'll be breakin' the law! Our brother Buffalo could go to jail!
30) 8) dialog: I know. Makes you wish things were back the way they were... before we was big executives.
30) 29) text: Fred and Barney cough in the rising dust. Neither one of them sees what we see, which is that visible in the hole in the wall is the Slate Company's granite-doored safe... ... and right beside it is the Xenosaurus, which now jumps up, startled, dropping a crowbar and a big hand drill. Recovering its composure, the Xenosaurus grabs up the tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away, vanishing just as our heroes stir.
30) 34) dialog: Come on Fred.    Time to earn those big bucks.
31) 5) dialog: Stee-rike one! Heh-hey.    Ready for a curve ball?
31) 6) text: Pyrite doesn't have a sense of humor; club in hand, he jumps up, starts chasing Barney through the rafters.
31) 15) dialog: Give me your best shot.
31) 16) text: Pyrite swings. Barney ducks and Pyrite SMASHES a WINDOW pane. Barney dodges again and the same thing happens. Getting cocky, Barney does it one more time... ... but this time the window is hinged in the center and the swivel action after the hit whaps Barney on the back and knocks him into Pyrite's next blow.
31) 37) dialog: Chuckles to himself... and then looks down, reacts. CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet another of the duplicate Freds. Worried, Barney looks around, sees that he's just above the Fibrefoam chute. Without another thought, he jumps into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride --
31) 42) dialog: (sitting up)
32) 12) text: He goes out, hardly looking at Barney. Wilma and Betty look at each other, mystified... then Wilma follows Fred out, puzzled.
33) 5) text: They both turn and start down an alley... jamming together as they do. Lava sighs... then jumps as Barney comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder.
33) 6) dialog: Excuse me, Mister Lava -- ? I think you oughta know... something could be wrong with the Fibrerock mix.
33) 11) dialog: It tastes different.
33) 13) dialog: Yup. See, ever since I started with Fibrerock -- I mean, since me and Fred started with it, I always take a little taste of the Fibre foam. And tonight's batch, well... I didn't get much of it, but it seems a little off. (smacking his lips) Can't fool the old taste buds, heh-heh. I think there might be an ingredient missing. So tomorrow, I'll run a couple of tests and stuff --
33) 15) dialog: Nine days, Mister Lava.
33) 17) text: He puts his arm around Barney, leads him towards the car where Betty is waiting.
33) 19) dialog: But --
34) 21) dialog: Looking around carefully, Barney takes out a Thermos bottle, unscrews the top, and quickly dunks it into the Fibrerock foam. Then he tiptoes O.S., right into the massive bulk of --
34) 27) dialog: (fake crotchety voice) Ah, yup, yup, young feller... jest show me the way to the personnel office... I'm lookin' fer a job as a custodian...
34) 29) text: Then they grab Barney with such force that the THERMOS drops and SHATTERS, drag him O.S. --
35) 27) text: You're too kind, Flintstone, that's what I like about you. But you're a big guy with a big decision to make. Are you gonna keep covering for Barney, keep pulling his acornsauruses out of the fire... or are you going to concentrate on your own important duties?
36) 21) dialog: Fred's in a high-powered executive job, Betty. There's a lot of pressure on him.
36) 23) dialog: Trust me, Betty. After the Fibrerock debut, he'll be the same old Fred.
36) 47) dialog: You mean beside Fred?
36) 54) dialog: (sotto, to them)
38) 10) text: B... Barney?
38) 11) dialog: (moving closer)
38) 19) dialog: Creep?
38) 21) dialog: (helpful tone) Fool?
38) 23) dialog: Slimeball? Louse? Jackass? (snapping fingers) Stuck-up blimpasaurus?
38) 25) dialog: (stepping closer) Sure, Fred. (smiling) I've had lots of practice.
38) 27) text: And he grabs Barney in a big bear hug. Tears in both their eyes, they slap each other on the back, two prehistoric sensitive guys.
39) 0) text: Fred and Barney are surrounded by books and cartons and memorabilia. They have their arms around each other and are singing. FRED &amp; BARNEY
39) 5) dialog: Yeah.   Too bad we never made the team. FRED
39) 6) text: So what? We made the team spirit. That's just as important... whatever happened to those cheerleader costumes? BARNEY
39) 9) text: Boy.    Talk about memories. Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney, who grins, pulls it on. Fred also starts to get into his old "uniform," but has to suck his gut in mightily. Finally, he can zip it up, stern to stem. FRED
39) 10) text: Back then, we thought a pop quiz was a big problem. We didn't know how good we had it. No problems, no worries... Saying this, Fred attempts to put on the Godzilla-like head. He has a hard time sliding it into a hinge rail behind his neck, an even harder time swinging it down and forward. BARNEY
39) 16) text: Completely covered in the ferocious-looking suit, Fred steps over to Barney, stabs an angry claw in his direction.
39) 20) dialog: Yeah?   When did you notice that?
39) 22) dialog: Boy, there's no fooling you, Fred.
39) 23) text: Suddenly, with a GROWING CREAKING, CRACKING and TINKLING, a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall apart. Fred and Barney look at each other, startled, then rush over to the model. It's the interim version we saw earlier.
39) 26) text: Barney tries to stop the process, can't.
39) 30) dialog: I... I don't know... the Fibrerock it's... it's decomposing... but this shouldn't happen...
39) 32) text: Indeed, the older models from Barney's tinkering days are rock solid.
39) 34) dialog: It should be. There's enough coo-coo berry resin in there to petrify a brontosaurus --
39) 35) text: Suddenly Barney gets it. He looks from the older models to the now decomposing little Fibresphere with growing awareness.
39) 36) dialog: (snapping his fingers) -- The coo-coo berries! Fred, that's it!
39) 38) dialog: Remember I said the Fibrefoam tasted funny? It was the coo-coo sap that was missing!
39) 40) dialog: Why? Because coo-coo berries are as valuable as goldrock! And we've had tons of 'em delivered to the plant since we started... somebody musta got greedy --
39) 42) dialog: (alarmed) Fred, that sap acts as a fixative -- it's the glue that holds the whole formula together -- !
39) 47) dialog: (finishing it) ... Is gonna happen for real in the real Slate City!
39) 51) text: Barney runs to a locker, grabs a big plunger-powered flit gun, begins filling it with a red liquid.
39) 52) dialog: Coo-coo berry sap, Fred! It's our only chance -- their only chance!
39) 53) text: Barney gives it a quick test squirt. Fred nods, and they rush out of the room. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the ruins of the model "Slate City"...
42) 0) text: Fred and Barney rush along, Fred at the wheel.
42) 2) dialog: We just tell Mister Slate that all 500 acres of his development are going to crumble into dust any minute. (holds up the flit gun)
42) 8) text: Barney gets up on his knees, grabs the wheel with one hand and the monster head with the other.
42) 9) dialog: Hang on, hang on --
42) 10) text: Oops. He rotates the head completely around. Fred flails around. Barney grabs the wheel with one hand, tries to help Fred with the other.
44) 26) dialog: What, and explain what you're doing in that costume? Start talking about coo-coo berries and Fibrerock? By then it'll be too late!
44) 30) text: Fred and Barney stagger out of the wreck. Barney, covered with debris, rummages around and sighs with relief when he finds the flit gun of coo-coo sap is still intact.
44) 31) dialog: (hearing a siren) We'd better split up; that way at least one of us can make it to the Slate Needle -- !
46) 0) text: The supporting pylons and cable anchors begin to slowly decompose. A FLIGHT of STAIRS CREAKS AND GROANS. Barney runs INTO the SHOT, sees the steps about to go, dives for them... too late! He ends up with a face full of Fibredust! Now, he whirls as Fred runs up, points --
46) 2) text: Barney runs toward it, hits the button.
46) 6) text: Barney aims, pulls back the plunger... too late! The elevator is gone. The cable swings back and forth loosely, "whapping" the shaft walls as it shoots upwards. Fred dives for the cable, misses! As he stumbles, Barney leaps on Fred's back, catches the cable! As Barney starts to whizz upwards, Fred garbs onto his ankles!
48) 4) dialog: (recovering) Fred, stop it! It might know the way inside!
48) 6) text: Fred and Barney both leap on the mysterious xenosaurus -- all crash through a wall --
49) 0) text: The panicked partygoers turn as a section of wall collapses. Dust and debris billow upwards. The battered monster mask breaks loose from Fred's costume, bounces on the floor. Slowly, everyone gets up: Fred... Barney ... and two halves of the xenosaurus: The bottom half is Piltdown; the top-half is Pyrite.
49) 25) text: He leaps, snarling, on top of Lava... Fred and Barney pull them apart. Then, more falling dust and beams give everyone more pressing problems --
50) 8) text: Fred!   There's a fire hose -- ! Indeed, it's on the back wall in a closed box marked FIRE HOSE--IN CASE OF EMERGENCY BREAK GLASS. Fred and Barney take a step towards it, but the fire quickly spreads and cuts them off. Helpless, they step back. With a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the two SLATE SCRAPERS visible through what's left of the picture window COLLAPSE. Then the big statue of Slate just outside the window begins to decompose. It falls in on itself like a sand sculpture in a storm... finally, for a split second it is, well, life-sized, and then the head of the statue snaps loose, CRASHES through the only remaining pane of GLASS here ... rolls up to Slate's feet. Pause. Everyone looks at everyone else. This is it: Titanic time. Fred embraces Wilma... Barney embraces Betty. Their kids are pulled into the clinch. Even Slate takes Mrs. Slate's hand. Talk about grace under pressure... and speaking of --
50) 12) dialog: (pause; false smile)
50) 20) dialog: It must be the suit, Fred -- old Bedrock High built them things to last --
50) 21) text: Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the guests from the fire hose. As everyone gets the same idea, Dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth. All brighten. Barney helps Fred with the head, twists it into place.
50) 22) dialog: (rapping on the head) -- Okay?
50) 33) dialog: Come on, everybody -- we'll go out the way we came!
50) 34) text: Barney squirts a pathway with his flit gun, solidifying a route in the crumbling Fibrerock. Then Barney and Fred stand back nobly, wave everyone on into the adjacent Fibresphere.
50) 43) text: Depressed, the pythonsaurus follows the others. Fred and Barney cross over into the Fibresphere. As the do, Slate Needle completely collapses.
51) 18) dialog: (to Betty) Go on, honey... I got Bam-Bam!
51) 31) text: Their kids on their backs, Fred and Barney exchange a heroic forearm-to-forearm gladiator-type handshake... both put their hands on the cable... and then the whole pulley mechanism falls right down between them and through the hole! A second later, the entire remaining structure collapses!
51) 34) text: Figures on one of the islands stir: Fred. Barney. Bam-Bam... Pebbles! The platform shudders again. Barney aims the flit gun -- empty! The dads hold on to the kids. It's all they can do.
51) 44) text: Dino dives through the hoops of bamboo, duplicating his steps in "The Dino Dance." He reaches the other island! Without a beat, still keeping time, he puts the two kids on his shoulders, just like in the dance! Then he "presents" his tail to Fred -- Fred hands his tail to Barney -- and then --
51) 75) dialog: You think there's gonna be some?
51) 86) dialog: (sniffing it) Lava Lava leaves... Woca sap... all still there, but now the nutrients are all released... (realizing) ... Fred, this... this is Dino kibble!
