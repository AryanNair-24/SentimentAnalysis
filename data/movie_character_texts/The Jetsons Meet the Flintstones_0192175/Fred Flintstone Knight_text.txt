1) 3) dialog: 
3) 11) text: Those walking fingers have reached the top edge of the covers... now they pull them down revealing the owner's face... the face of Fred, his eyes at half-mast, his face covered in fashionable "Bedrock Vice" stubble.
3) 12) dialog: (with genuine charm) Wil-ma. Wil-ma? How about a great big good morning kiss for your Freddy-weddy?
3) 13) text: And he pulls the covers down to reveal -- DINO, who is immediately "YI-YI-YI-YI-ING," hopping all over the bed and showering Fred with sloppy kisses.
3) 14) dialog: Dino!   Dino, cut it out -- !
3) 21) text: By now Dino's affection   attack has knocked both master and pet to the floor in   a jumble of bedclothes, asses and elbows. Dino begins    to roll Fred across the room like a seal playing with   a ball.
3) 22) dialog: Dino, that's enough -- here, look, Daddy has a nice dino bone for you, just please stop it --
3) 23) text: Fred has now backed up to a dresser, where he grabs a brightly-colored box labeled "PURINROCK DINO TREATS." Fred holds it up -- Dino gets up on two legs, eager for the treat -- Fred shakes the box... alas, nothing comes out. DINO "YI-YI'S" again, propelling Fred into the next room.
4) 0) text: Five-year-old PEBBLES GIGGLES at the table as Fred and Dino tumble into the room like Frank Buck and a lion. Wilma turns at the noise. One look at her and we under- stand Fred's romantic turn.
4) 3) text: Saying this, Wilma puts   a huge egg at Fred's place. Meanwhile, Fred manages   to get to his feet, holds out one arm to keep Dino at   bay. Fred does a big "take," looking out the window   --
4) 7) dialog: (throwing open the door) Oooh, Dino, look -- there's a nice big dino bone laying out on the front lawn -- !
4) 9) dialog: (trying again) -- Gosh, look at that adorable little female dino --
4) 10) text: "YI-YI-YI-YI," DINO is out the door like a rocket. Fred cackles, slams it shut, then sits down at the table.
4) 11) dialog: -- That animal's gonna kill me with kindness. Do you know we're out of dino treats?
4) 15) dialog: (sitting down) And what's wrong with my leftovers?
4) 23) dialog: That's right, sweetheart. The only thing that's gonna eat you up is -- me!
4) 26) dialog: Pebbles, don't worry. These stories are very exaggerated. Like, you know, the boogyman? There's no such thing as a huge, inhuman reptile that attacks without warning --
4) 27) text: WHAM! Dino reappears, bounding through the window and knocking Fred onto the floor. Once again Dino is happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously unresponsive owner. Fred struggles to avoid the slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill, looks out.
4) 28) dialog: -- Oh, look, everybody, the mailman is here --
4) 29) text: "YI-YI-YI-YI!" DINO buys it again, runs to the door, lets himself out. This time Fred puts a chair against the door. Meanwhile, Wilma turns at the sound of the TOASTER POPPING UP. We see that the "claws" we saw earlier were the actual claws of a LOBSTER in a little fireproof suit who is tucked inside the toaster. As Wilma takes the toast, the Lobster blows on his claws, wincing, then looks TOWARDS the CAMERA.
4) 34) dialog: (taking the toast) Thanks, Wilma...
4) 35) text: Fred slaps jelly on the toast, takes a big bite, and then something outside the window catches his eye.
4) 38) dialog: Arnold! Arnold! Don't aim at the house -- please, not at the house --
4) 39) text: WHAM! Fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams into the window frame, SMASHING a FLOWERPOT, taking out a chunk of wall, and continuing diagonally through the kitchen and out another window. Fred follows this action in time to see --
4) 43) dialog: (slight smile) Yeah.   What else can go wrong?
4) 44) text: He slices through the big egg with his knife -- releasing a baby PTERODACTYL which SQUAWKS and flaps, knocking Fred over as it takes off through the window.
5) 0) text: Fred -- now dressed for work -- is forlornly trying to fix his car.
5) 6) dialog: 'Bye, little sweetheart. (as Wilma clears her throat) 'Bye, big sweetheart.
5) 7) text: Fred kisses them both and they drive off. Fred sighs, tries to stretch the canvas roof edges close enough to stitch. Nearby, Dino struggles to drag the stone news- paper inside the house. The twin headlines are, of course, KIBBLE CRISIS GROWS and MYSTERIOUS XENOSAURUS STRIKES AGAIN. Suddenly a pink flamingo appears over the hedge. As its mouth opens and closes, it appears to be talking, but the voice is that of --
5) 9) dialog: What's nice about it?
5) 12) dialog: This is the third ragtop this year ... say, shouldn't you be at work?
5) 14) dialog: You got fired, didn't ya?
5) 19) dialog: Yeah, I know, I know, those crazy inventions of yours. Be honest with me, Barn... tell me one thing you invented that really caught on.
5) 21) dialog: (pause) You invented fire?
5) 23) dialog: Yeah, but did any one of them ever put bread on the table? How long are you and Betty gonna live on those penny-ante royalties you get?
5) 24) text: Fred pulls his car hood off of its wooden hinges, examines it with dismay.
5) 25) dialog: If you ask me, pal, you're just blowing smoke up your own volcano...
5) 27) text: He uses the flamingo's jaws to snatch the car hood from Fred's surprised grasp.
6) 0) text: We can still see Fred's car in the neighboring driveway. (We can also see Dino, who drags the newspaper on a bit more, then collapses from exhaustion). Barney's garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and ends, plus various inventions and scale models in different stages of completion. (Interestingly, a number of these anticipate Leonardo da Vinci's work). Many of the models are made of a strange celadon green material. Fred watches, skeptical, as Barney presses the car hood into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone.
6) 4) dialog: (impressed)
6) 7) text: Fred is caked with dust.   He coughs and spits.
6) 8) dialog: Barney, why don't you try inventing a brain for yourself! Look at what you did to --
7) 0) text: Fred and Barney drive along. (Behind them, the same houses and palms seem to be going by... duplex, palm... split level, two palms... duplex, palm). Barney grins, gestures towards the front of the car.
7) 2) dialog: Okay, you fixed a dented hood. But you call that a living? Face it, pal, this is the Stone Age, and it's a dino eat dino world. You want my advice?
7) 7) dialog: You stick with me today, cruise on down to the quarry and fill out a job application. I'm a big man there, Barney --
7) 9) dialog: I'm serious, pal. Me and Mr. Slate are just like this --
7) 11) dialog: -- just like that. I know, I know -- you're not a clock-punching guy -- but face it, Barney -- it's time to grow up and put your nose to the grindstone, batten down the hatches and join the ratasaurus race with the rest of us. (meaningfully) It's time to retire those dreams.
7) 12) text: Barney looks glum, doesn't say anything.    Suddenly Fred pulls over, stops the car.
7) 13) dialog: Barney.   Look.
7) 16) dialog: Remember the old days, Barn? We used to race our go-carts here to impress the girls.
7) 18) text: A look from one to another, and then down the hill... Fred gets a malicious grin on his face.
7) 23) dialog: Hey. Since when do I have to be consistent?
7) 26) dialog: 
7) 28) text: Suddenly both Fred and Barney see the RADAR BIRD flying alongside them. It checks its stopwatch, writes a note to itself. Fred is so preoccupied he doesn't notice as --
7) 31) dialog: Sergeant Feldspar, I... I wasn't speeding... honest...
7) 32) text: Fred reaches down to the floorboard as he speaks...
7) 38) text: Fred opens the box. A scary-looking winged reptile sticks out its head, smacks its hungry lips.
7) 44) dialog: Well, Sergeant, if you don't have a radar reading, I guess we'll -- (quickly) -- justbeonourway -- !
7) 45) text: A new cloud of dust appears as Fred ROARS away.
11) 0) text: Clouds of dust rise from behind the fence. We see the heads of the heavy equipment dinos rising and falling. A two-story office building is at one end of the site with a big "Slate Construction Inc." sign on the roof. CAMERA ADJUSTS as Fred's car turns into the lot, Barney seated beside Fred. The new green hood gleams in the morning light.
11) 1) text: Fred digs his feet into the ground, slams to a halt. He gets out, surveys the activity. Immediately, the various workers shout AD LIB greetings. Fred acknowledges these, beaming in the respect he gets here. He lovingly dusts off his construction helmet, puts it on knocks an offending speck from his parking sign (F. Flintstone - Shop Steward). He leads Barney towards the quarry area.
11) 2) dialog: Barney, you won't regret this -- hiya, Al -- fixing dents in cars is one thing, a career's another. Here, you're getting in on the ground floor of the first footstep of a new leaf -- hi, Wally, how's the old backhand? And with a guy like me ta show you the ropes, you can skip all the red tape, all the malarky, all the dino doo --
11) 4) text: Fred stands near the weight station booth, where a plump GIRL in a beehive hairdo sits inside a trailer.
11) 7) dialog: Hiya, Shirley. This is my very special neighbor and pal Barney Rubble. He needs an application form, okay?
11) 11) dialog: My pleasure, Shirl.    Anytime.
11) 13) dialog: (confidently)
11) 14) text: No problem. Fred smiles at her, hands the forms to Barney. Fres steps towards the quarry, admires the activity, hands on hips, master of all he surveys. He waves to more friends.
11) 15) dialog: Well, Barn, what did I tell you? When you're in with Flintstone, you're in like Flint.
13) 0) text: Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving. Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them, we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the quarry's sides. BARNEY (to himself)
13) 2) text: ... Personal reference... Hearing a loud SMASH, Fred looks up and sees --
13) 6) text: Piltdown's compact buddy PYRITE cackles, sweeps  up the walnuts. Munching them, he balances a new one   in place. (It should be noted here that the relationship  and physi cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors  that of our heroes... they're sort of an anti-Fred and  Barney.) PYRITE
13) 10) dialog: Not again... Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to the level of Piltdown's cab. Barney hurries to follow. FRED
13) 13) text: Says me, Fred Flintstone -- shop steward of Amalgamated Neolithic Workers 101. PILTDOWN
13) 19) text: Workers scatter, fearful of the imminent collapse.   Fred runs to grab the dino's reins.
13) 20) dialog: Whoa, whoa, big fella -- He calms the beast by giving it a carrot.   As it munches Fred quickly ties the reins to a post.
13) 21) dialog: (calling up to the cab)
13) 25) dialog: Fat butt? Hold me back, Barney -- (sotto, very sincere)
13) 26) text: -- Barney, hold me back -- Quickly the men form a circle around Piltdown and Fred. Barney looks up and sees --
13) 35) dialog: Yeah.  That's right. (realizing, a glare at Barney) I mean -- this ain't over, Piltdown. (turning, shouting) Come on, guys. Let's clean up the mess.
14) 14) dialog: Barney!   Grab that line!   Hurry!
14) 15) text: Barney scrambles up Fred's back, shoving a foot in Fred's face, but finally snatching the rope. He pulls on it... Fred throws his own weight into the effort...
16) 3) dialog: Oh boy.    Goodbye pension fund -- They rush for the office building.
17) 2) text: I'm over here, you moron -- and don't call me 'Uncle'! Slate's eyes fall on Fred's car hood, swinging from a bookshelf. He reaches for it -- pulls it -- it stays put, and only releases a new deluge of rubble and plaster which reburies him. At the same time, the door slams open and Fred, Barney and the other workers tumble inside
17) 8) dialog: Barney, shut up -- (turning) Mr. Slate -- Mr. Slate -- are you all right?
17) 23) text: Fred cringes.       Piltdown and Pyrite smirk.
17) 25) dialog: Huh?                               What?
17) 29) dialog: Oh, it's ah, just something I whipped up in the old garage workshop -- (quickly) -- with a little help from my buddy Barney, right, Barn?
17) 31) text: Fred hisses between his teeth, repeats the "Slate and me are just like this" gesture he made earlier, points at Slate.
17) 42) dialog: Well, Mr. Slate, I call it -- (hesitating, sotto) -- Barney, what do I call it?
17) 44) dialog: -- I call it Fibrerock Fred -- ! (realizing) I mean, ah, 'Fibrerock'!
17) 52) text: Slate takes the piece of material, leans it on the table so it catches the light. Despite himself, Lava comes over, examines the car hood... can't help but marvel at it as well. Meanwhile, Slate puts his arms around Fred and Barney.
17) 55) text: Lava glowers. Slate pulls Fred and Barney close with genuine excitement.
17) 57) text: He points to the translucent material. CAMERA TIGHTENS ON it. We see Fred, Barney and Slate's reflections in it.
19) 0) text: They're cruising along. Fred puffs on a cigar. Barney flips the pile of legal sized tablets in his lap. In the back seat are some boxes and bundles.
19) 2) dialog: Just be thankful I was there to go over the fine print. (full of himself) It's like I told you this morning -- There's something noble about a man digging in with his hands and doing an honest day's work. Once you file those dreams under 'old business' and put your nose to the plow, well, the world is your oyster. And was I right?
19) 4) dialog: (after a moment) Details, Barney, details... (smiling) I just can't wait to see the girls' faces when we tell 'em the news...
20) 21) text: Suddenly the door bursts open.     Fred and Barney run in with candy and flowers.
20) 22) dialog: Surprise!
20) 26) dialog: Why? Oh, me and Barn, we suddenly realized that we had a little spare change.
20) 31) text: Fred laughs good naturedly, grabs Barney in a headlock.
20) 32) dialog: Noogy, noogy, ha, ha -- !
20) 37) text: In reply, Fred whips a bottle of champagne into view.
20) 38) dialog: Ready when you are. (noticing the label) Hey, '1'... a good year.
20) 41) text: She closes her eyes, swings the enrollment forms over on the table so that Fred and Barney can read them. Fred and Barney look at them, look at each other... and yawn.
20) 46) dialog: We see your dollar signs, ladies... and...
20) 48) dialog: ... we raise them.
20) 54) dialog: You bet they're real, sweetheart. They're as real as... as... well, as real as -- (embracing the group) -- the best darn friends and neighbors in the whole world.
20) 57) dialog: (emotionally) Right, pal o'mine.
22) 21) text: Cheers go up, which drown out Piltdown's renewed cry of the poisoned water hole. Fred moves towards the podium as the noise dies down.
22) 22) text: Barney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant. He tacks it to the wall, yanks a string. It unrolls. It's a big "VOTE FOR FRED FLINTSTONE" poster. Barney turns, gives Fred a "thumbs up," and as he does, Barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his pocket. Barney pushes his way through the seats, catches up to Fred and hands him the document. Fred takes it, continues up to the podium. There, the Herdmaster hands Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each other like a Pharaoh's badges of office. Fred does a Papal-like wave with these, sets them down, and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him.
22) 23) dialog: (reading, at first wooden, then confident) Brother Buffaloes, honored Herdmaster, Junior Bucks and Apprentice Antlers, a great good evening to you all. Ahem. As you know, our organization has survived difficult times that have seen the extinction of such other lodges as the Order of Whooping Cranes and Brotherhood of Giant Sloths. But we here have come through the croo ... the crux...
22) 28) dialog: (grateful) -- crucible with our fur fluffy and our hooves unscathed. Now, the future holds many promises and many problems. As your next Herdmaster, I would bring to you the same determination, courage and -- if I may say so -- bold thinking that I have brought to the workplace. Thank you, and ack ack a-dack.
22) 29) text: Applause follows Fred's return to the floor.
23) 4) dialog: Hey, when you're hot you're hot... boys, lemme buy a round of drinks for everyone.
23) 9) dialog: But the principle is the same, Barn. Don't forget that.
23) 10) text: Fred leads the group over to the bar. Piltdown and Pyrite come along with a shrug... why not, for a brew? Fred reaches --
23) 13) dialog: (during this) Here you go, boys, nice and frosty...
23) 15) text: Fred tosses the "Opener" aside --
23) 18) dialog: (raising drink) Well, here's to...
23) 25) text: 'Here's to the Water Buffalo and their next Herdmaster... Fred'! FRED
23) 28) text: Fred, what was all that stuff in your speech about the workplace? I thought the only decision you made there was how many lunches to eat -- Laughter. Fred accepts it good-naturedly, reaches into his pocket. FRED
23) 29) text: Well, Harry, it just so happens that old Fred is moving up in the world... Boys, you're looking at Mr. Slate's new partner. PILTDOWN
23) 30) text: You and Slate? Who are you kidding, Flintstone? The only partner you got is hanging over your belt. Pyrite laughs, a bit too much. FRED
23) 32) text: -- If I don't, you will -- FRED (a tight smile)
23) 38) text: Hey, way ta go, Fred... Whoa, gonna switch from a hard hat to a top hat, Freddy boy...? PYRITE (examining the card)
23) 41) text: Gee, Fred, how come I didn't get any business cards? FRED
23) 43) text: Yes, boys, you see, I went up to my pal, Mister Slate and single- handedly made him an offer he couldn't refuse -- (Barney reacts to the "single-handedly" --) FRED
23) 44) text: -- 'Freddy boy,' he sez to me, 'We gotta talk turkey -- ' BARNEY
23) 45) text: Fred, we gotta talk turkey -- FRED
23) 47) text: Fred -- ! Fred realizes Barney's got something on his mind. FRED
23) 50) text: Fred pulls Barney into a quiet corridor. They stand near a trophy case. There's some bowling trophies here with a variety of names on them. (There's also trophies for "pie-eating contests" and "beer drinking chug-offs"; these have only Fred's name on them.)
23) 52) dialog: (lowered voice)
23) 55) dialog: This is big business, Barney. We can't start telling the truth, it'd create the wrong impression. Think about all the really big deals in history -- back to the beginning of recorded time. Barney knits his brow in thought for maybe three seconds.
23) 57) dialog: What do they all have in common? (as Barney is stumped)
23) 60) dialog: That's because the silent partner is always silent.
23) 65) dialog: But while you're busy being silent -- (conspiratorially) -- all along you're the brains behind the operation and I'm the brains in front of the operation. I'm out here running the guts of the operation but you got a cut. It looks like my mind, but you're really behind.
23) 67) dialog: Attaboy!
23) 68) text: And a confident Fred shakes hands with an unsure "silent partner"...
24) 0) text: Barney comes out of his front door, heads toward the neighboring driveway and Fred's car. Betty comes out, calls to her husband.

24) 16) dialog: Aw, Wilma... lookit, it's got buckles, a strap, a lock --
24) 18) dialog: -- Baby, you're the greatest.
24) 20) dialog: I'm already taken.
24) 22) dialog: Ah, Mister Rubble, I presume? Of the Fibrerock Rubbles?
24) 27) dialog: Yas, yas. The water was too deep and my horse drowned.
25) 0) text: Fred and Barney appear in Fred's car, make a very quick turn into the quarry lot.
25) 6) dialog: (getting out) Gets the old adrenaline going, Barn. Us big executives, we need that kind of jolt to get the old wheels turning.
25) 11) text: They move along. Fred notices a hotbed of activity nearby. Workers move scaffolding, animals labor.
25) 12) dialog: Hey.   What's going on?
25) 14) dialog: Yes, yes. Quick, dynamic entry into the marketplace. I approve.
25) 19) dialog: Hey, you're right... (resigned) ... Big business is hell, Barney. Trust me... you'll get used to it.
25) 23) text: He goes off.    Fred and Barney go --
25) 27) dialog: Welcome to the top -- partner.
25) 43) text: Fred and Barney, weary, approach each other, shake hands as they view the day's incredible output. Other weary, but proud workers gather around them: Mr. Slate is about to address them from his office balcony.
25) 57) text: All eyes swivel and bore into Fred, who is as shocked as anyone.
25) 59) dialog: I do? (realizing) I mean, I do, yeah!
26) 9) dialog: (undeterred) Mr. Slate -- we gotta talk --
26) 11) dialog: About those guys outside, Mr. Slate. Some of 'em, well, they been here for years. And you, well, you can't lay them off just like -- (snapping fingers) -- that!
26) 12) text: Slate looks at Lava, who shrugs. Slate looks back at Fred, stays surprisingly calm. He toys with the putter, balances it on his palm.
26) 16) dialog: (bravura slipping) Oh, you can, huh?
26) 26) dialog: (guffawing) Me! Ah, ha, that's rich, Mr. Slate, that's --
26) 27) text: Suddenly Fred stops laughing.
26) 29) dialog: Uh... well, gee, I... uh, yeah.
26) 31) text: Fred swallows, looks at Lava, goes meekly out.
27) 0) text: All the Workers watch expectantly as Fred comes out. They AD LIB --

29) 10) text: Fred crosses to the other guys, puts on a big smile.
29) 11) dialog: Guys, guys, come on now -- what's a quarry fulla layoffs got to do with a lodge fulla Buffaloes?
29) 15) dialog: Fellas, come on. We're all big boys here --
29) 17) dialog: Surely we can separate in our minds work, and play... Job, and Lodge...
29) 24) dialog: Wait, wait... Your Antlerness, please, one second -- !
29) 25) text: Fred grabs Barney by the shoulder, spins him around, pushes him forward like a refrigerator on a dolly, stands him up center stage.
29) 26) dialog: Barney, you gotta tell the other guys what really happened. Tell 'em the story behind Fibrerock. The true story.
29) 27) text: The room quiets.    Barney clears his throat.     Fred wa hopeful.
29) 29) dialog: No, no, the rest --!
29) 31) text: Barney turns, gives Fred a big wink.    Fred groans.
29) 41) text: Fred snorts, sounding like Herb Alpert's lonely bull. Even under his furry fez we see him "looking around" desperately, hoping to hear one more snort. He kind of sneaks in one more forlorn grunt which fades away... finally, as Fred squirms miserably, there is one more lonely snort... ... from Barney, of course.
29) 48) dialog: Big deal, after you screwed everything up in the first place...!
29) 49) text: Barney reacts, really hurt. He moves away on the bench. Fred's so agitated he doesn't even realize it.
29) 61) dialog: No kidding. They rejected the best candidate --
29) 63) dialog: (genuinely worried) Oh, no! That -- that's horrible! (pause) We could end up with half a percent of nothing!
29) 65) dialog: Oh, yeah, yeah, that, too... come on, Barn, we gotta stop 'em!
30) 7) dialog: I don't believe this... how did things ever get this out of hand -- ?
30) 9) dialog: Well, I wouldn't go that far...
30) 10) text: Suddenly they're interrupted by the sound of a SIREN. Fred looks back and sees --
30) 13) dialog: Oh, no, not now...
30) 14) text: Feldspar signals Fred onto the shoulder.       Fred smile nods...
30) 16) text: Fred's CAR SKIDS, spins out, whirling around like a record on a turntable. It jerks to a halt 180 degrees later, and then ROARS off in the opposite direction.
30) 29) text: Fred and Barney cough in the rising dust. Neither one of them sees what we see, which is that visible in the hole in the wall is the Slate Company's granite-doored safe... ... and right beside it is the Xenosaurus, which now jumps up, startled, dropping a crowbar and a big hand drill. Recovering its composure, the Xenosaurus grabs up the tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away, vanishing just as our heroes stir.
30) 33) dialog: (double-taking) Barn! Did you see that -- ? (peering through the dust) -- Huh, now it's gone... I coulda sworn...
31) 9) text: Fred is hanging on the other end.
31) 10) dialog: Brother Piltdown... can we talk about this, antler to antler?
31) 12) dialog: Guess not...
31) 13) text: Fred inches down the shuddering beam, jumps off. Freed of Fred's weight, the other end "BOINGS" down on Piltdown's head. He groans, recovers in time to chase after Fred.
31) 17) dialog: Is backpedaling away from Piltdown on the upper super- structure of the assembly line. Fred scrapes one foot in an arc in front of him.
31) 18) dialog: Dare you to cross that line.
31) 20) dialog: That line.
31) 26) dialog: is flung to the conveyor belt, stiffly caked in clay.
31) 30) dialog: Back down the line, he's seen this. His clay-caked Adam's apple gulps. Quickly, he turns and tries to "tip-toe" away -- then, with a CREAK and CRUNCH -- the clay and Fibre all over him solidifies! Desperate, he tries to move... can't!
31) 43) text: Whattya know. Even got the spare again... Then he gasps as he looks over at Fred, whose head has just fallen off! Pause. Fred's real head slowly pokes up out of the clay and Fibre shoulders. Before he can extricate himself further, Feldspar and his men are dragging them out of the building.
32) 11) dialog: I don't wanna talk about it. Besides, who cares about a bunch of jerks running around with furs on their heads? I'm more of a country club guy myself anyway...
32) 12) text: He goes out, hardly looking at Barney. Wilma and Betty look at each other, mystified... then Wilma follows Fred out, puzzled.

35) 42) dialog: (still in a dazed thrill) Barney who?

36) 14) dialog: It's the Rubble yard, Wilma.   It's just not the right image...
36) 38) dialog: He has just carved "FREDERICK" into a stone cue card and points to it.
36) 42) dialog: Now he's carved something grander.    Leach sighs, goes on.
36) 51) dialog: (very affected accent)
36) 58) dialog: No, I could never have done it without the inspiration and support of a very special person. I'm speaking, of course, of my close friend and associate, Mister Slate, founder and C.E.O. of Slate Construction...

37) 10) dialog: Hello, hello. Bon soir. Good to see ya... glad you could make it...

37) 14) dialog: (alarmed) You mean you can see their house -- ?
37) 16) dialog: Wilma, I'm shocked. I wouldn't do that. Okay, I admit it: I'm trying to make an impression here, I wanna look good, I wanna be a success...
37) 21) dialog: ... But deep down inside, I'm still the same lovable guy you married -- (pause) -- Frederick von Flintstone the third --
37) 24) dialog: What'd I say?
37) 28) dialog: In the middle of a tight little group which is pigging out. Fred seems oblivious to the fact that they're oblivious to him.

37) 36) dialog: Fred!
37) 38) dialog: Hey, what's the hurry? We got a cake shaped like a piece of Fibrerock... I got it, how about some charades? No, even better, twenty questions: 'Am I animal, mineral, or fossil'...? Oh, I heard a great one the other day ... a guy walks in a bar with a duckasaurus on his head and the bartender says -- this'll kill you, the bartender says --
37) 39) text: Fred stops, running out of steam along with his moment of glory. He stands alone on the lawn. Wilma slowly comes up to him.
37) 41) text: Fred turns, puts on a big smile.
37) 42) dialog: Whaddya mean, not working out? They're goin' party hopping, that's all. That's what ya do in society, Wilma... you cruise around. They'll go over to Slate's shindig for a while, then they'll come back here.
37) 44) dialog: You go on over to Slate City, okay?
37) 49) dialog: Nah, me and some of the guys from the country club, we're gonna play poker, yeah, big stakes poker until everybody comes back. Go on with the others. The kids got their show to put on anyway... and I wouldn't want people to think... to think the Flintstones were party poopers.
38) 3) dialog: Just you and me now, Dino. Yeah. That's okay. Man and man's best friend. He gives Dino one of the canapes. Dino tastes it, makes a face, spits it out. DINO runs off, going "PTOOIE" all the way. We see him run to the corner, jump in Betty's car and drive away.
38) 4) dialog: sighs, looks around, down at his blazer and the "FVF" patch. He suddenly rips it off in a fury. Then he looks at --

39) 1) text: 'Now it's time to do or die, grab that rock and kick it high, let's fight, fight, fight for Bedrock High!' They break up laughing. Fred chuckles, looks at one of the many old photographs strewn around.
39) 2) dialog: Boy, those were the days, Barney. Bedrock High winning all those games... and you and me right in the middle of it.
39) 8) dialog: (rummaging in it)
39) 9) text: Boy.    Talk about memories. Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney, who grins, pulls it on. Fred also starts to get into his old "uniform," but has to suck his gut in mightily. Finally, he can zip it up, stern to stem. FRED
39) 10) text: Back then, we thought a pop quiz was a big problem. We didn't know how good we had it. No problems, no worries... Saying this, Fred attempts to put on the Godzilla-like head. He has a hard time sliding it into a hinge rail behind his neck, an even harder time swinging it down and forward. BARNEY
39) 11) text: Speaking of problems and worries, shouldn't we get on over to Slate's party? Fred has finally "clinked" the monster head down into place. Now, when he talks, the monster's mouth moves in sync.
39) 15) dialog: (echo-y) What for? So him and all his fancy friends can look down their noses at us?
39) 16) text: Completely covered in the ferocious-looking suit, Fred steps over to Barney, stabs an angry claw in his direction.
39) 17) dialog: (echo-y) All they've been doing is using us, Barney. And meanwhile --
39) 18) text: Now Fred reaches up to take the head off. It sticks for a moment. Finally he gets it to flip back on its hinge where it hangs behind his neck like a ski parka hood.
39) 19) dialog: (normal voice) -- Meanwhile all the time they were laughing at us.
39) 21) dialog: About an hour ago.
39) 23) text: Suddenly, with a GROWING CREAKING, CRACKING and TINKLING, a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall apart. Fred and Barney look at each other, startled, then rush over to the model. It's the interim version we saw earlier.
39) 25) dialog: Wha... what's happening?
39) 31) dialog: Your old models are just fine...
39) 37) dialog: What's it?

42) 1) dialog: What'll we do when we get there?
42) 3) text: Then we zap the stairs and corridors with some of this coo-coo sap. I just hope we have enough to get everybody out -- whoops! He's said this last because as he held up the flit gun, the handle whacked the back of Fred's monster costume, and the head has flipped down with a solid "clink."
42) 7) dialog: Barney -- ! (swerving all over the road) -- I can't see straight --
42) 10) text: Oops. He rotates the head completely around. Fred flails around. Barney grabs the wheel with one hand, tries to help Fred with the other.
44) 3) dialog: both still battling the wheel and the resistant costume head. (By now their gyrations have put Barney's face inside the jaws of the monster mask.)
44) 20) dialog: (muffled, shouting)
44) 24) dialog: Ho noh! Ahhrisser Felghspah! (turning to Barney)
44) 27) dialog: 'Hen yore height, yore height... Fred pours on more speed. They careen around a turn. CAMERA WHIP PANS TO a road sign: SLATE CITY--1 MI.
44) 30) text: Fred and Barney stagger out of the wreck. Barney, covered with debris, rummages around and sighs with relief when he finds the flit gun of coo-coo sap is still intact.

45) 34) dialog: Tries to catch up and collides with the already damaged house. It collapses totally, falling in on itself, obscuring Fred. Finally the last TIMBER DROPS. Pause. Fred staggers out of the rubble, realizes that the impact has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its hinges. He rubs dust out of his eyes, turns and looks at the Slate Needle. He's much closer to it now. Quickly, he runs toward it.
46) 0) text: The supporting pylons and cable anchors begin to slowly decompose. A FLIGHT of STAIRS CREAKS AND GROANS. Barney runs INTO the SHOT, sees the steps about to go, dives for them... too late! He ends up with a face full of Fibredust! Now, he whirls as Fred runs up, points --
46) 1) dialog: Barney!    The elevator -- !
46) 5) dialog: Quick!    Use your coo-coo gun -- !
46) 6) text: Barney aims, pulls back the plunger... too late! The elevator is gone. The cable swings back and forth loosely, "whapping" the shaft walls as it shoots upwards. Fred dives for the cable, misses! As he stumbles, Barney leaps on Fred's back, catches the cable! As Barney starts to whizz upwards, Fred garbs onto his ankles!
48) 5) text: Fred "gets up to speed" and chases the xeno.         Barn follows.
48) 6) text: Fred and Barney both leap on the mysterious xenosaurus -- all crash through a wall --
49) 0) text: The panicked partygoers turn as a section of wall collapses. Dust and debris billow upwards. The battered monster mask breaks loose from Fred's costume, bounces on the floor. Slowly, everyone gets up: Fred... Barney ... and two halves of the xenosaurus: The bottom half is Piltdown; the top-half is Pyrite.
49) 5) dialog: It's real simple, Mister Slate. Your boy Lava here has been stealing the coo-coo berries from the Fibrerock mix and fixing the books to hide it!
49) 16) dialog: (snapping fingers) Now I remember! These guys were pulling this xenosaurus act that night at the plant! What's this, Lava... 'Plan B'?
49) 25) text: He leaps, snarling, on top of Lava... Fred and Barney pull them apart. Then, more falling dust and beams give everyone more pressing problems --
50) 8) text: Fred!   There's a fire hose -- ! Indeed, it's on the back wall in a closed box marked FIRE HOSE--IN CASE OF EMERGENCY BREAK GLASS. Fred and Barney take a step towards it, but the fire quickly spreads and cuts them off. Helpless, they step back. With a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the two SLATE SCRAPERS visible through what's left of the picture window COLLAPSE. Then the big statue of Slate just outside the window begins to decompose. It falls in on itself like a sand sculpture in a storm... finally, for a split second it is, well, life-sized, and then the head of the statue snaps loose, CRASHES through the only remaining pane of GLASS here ... rolls up to Slate's feet. Pause. Everyone looks at everyone else. This is it: Titanic time. Fred embraces Wilma... Barney embraces Betty. Their kids are pulled into the clinch. Even Slate takes Mrs. Slate's hand. Talk about grace under pressure... and speaking of --
50) 13) text: Sure, pal. We just gotta wait for the fire department. Right, Fred?
50) 14) dialog: Y-yeah. Everything's gonna be just -- Whoa, hoo-hah, aggh --
50) 18) dialog: -- Wait a minute -- I don't feel anything at all --
50) 21) text: Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the guests from the fire hose. As everyone gets the same idea, Dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth. All brighten. Barney helps Fred with the head, twists it into place.
50) 23) dialog: Hist hust fine!
50) 29) text: Fred turns in a semi-circle and puts out every lick of flame in the room. All the guests cheer, rush forward and slap Fred on the back. Pebbles jumps up on him and kisses him.
50) 30) dialog: Hit fuzz nudding... wheely...
50) 34) text: Barney squirts a pathway with his flit gun, solidifying a route in the crumbling Fibrerock. Then Barney and Fred stand back nobly, wave everyone on into the adjacent Fibresphere.
50) 36) text: Meanwhile, the pythonsaurus gives Fred (or rather his costume) a big look up and down, looks TOWARD the CAMERA.
50) 38) text: Just then Fred tilts back the monster head.        The pythonsaurus reacts.
50) 43) text: Depressed, the pythonsaurus follows the others. Fred and Barney cross over into the Fibresphere. As the do, Slate Needle completely collapses.
51) 15) dialog: (to Pebbles) Upsy-daisy, sweetheart -- piggy back time!

51) 31) text: Their kids on their backs, Fred and Barney exchange a heroic forearm-to-forearm gladiator-type handshake... both put their hands on the cable... and then the whole pulley mechanism falls right down between them and through the hole! A second later, the entire remaining structure collapses!
51) 34) text: Figures on one of the islands stir: Fred. Barney. Bam-Bam... Pebbles! The platform shudders again. Barney aims the flit gun -- empty! The dads hold on to the kids. It's all they can do.
51) 44) text: Dino dives through the hoops of bamboo, duplicating his steps in "The Dino Dance." He reaches the other island! Without a beat, still keeping time, he puts the two kids on his shoulders, just like in the dance! Then he "presents" his tail to Fred -- Fred hands his tail to Barney -- and then --
51) 49) dialog: rolls out of the net and away from the others. He's slightly stunned, still in the suit. He sits up... suddenly lights snap on all around him! Fred looks up and sees --
51) 52) dialog: (with desperate poignancy) High ham noght a zenosore! High ham hay hooman beeng -- !
51) 53) text: BAM! WHAM! KABAM! Bullets and projectiles begin slamming all around Fred! He ducks behind a big fallen chunk of Fibrerock -- catches his breath as the bullets and shells bounce off its resilient surface.
51) 54) dialog: Momentarily safe, he tries desperately to remove that stupid head -- bangs it against the wall, tears at it with his claws -- -- meanwhile, the chunk of Fibrerock protecting him decomposes! He's back in the line of fire!
51) 61) text: Now Fred confirms Gravel's hunch as the costume head finally pops off. All the cops lower their guns. (Strangely, though, Feldspar still continues to raise his gun -- even aims! Then an alarmed Gravel wrestles it away from his superior.)
51) 85) dialog: Barn...?    What's going on?
51) 87) dialog: Dino kibble...?
51) 88) text: Disbelieving, Fred moves over to the happily-munching animals. He has to get on his knees to wiggle in with the pack. He grabs some, stuffs it in his mouth... chews. His eyes widen...
51) 89) dialog: (mouth full) Dhinough khibble!!
51) 91) dialog: Barney, we -- we're rich! Yabba dabba do -- !

54) 0) text: WIDEN FROM the mailbox. Fred and family pull up. Dino runs in first, followed by Wilma with Pebbles already asleep on her shoulder. Fred follows, the saber-tooth cat on his heels. Fred stops in the doorway to put a milk bottle on the doorstep, and then puts the cat down beside it. He shuts the door. Quick as a flash, the cat leaps through the side window. Pause. The door opens and the cat puts Fred out, then slams the door! Fred recovers from his shock, tries the door... it's locked!
54) 2) dialog: (knocking) Wilma...? (another knock) ... Wilma?
54) 3) text: CAMERA CRANES UP, WIDENS as Fred becomes a tiny sil- houette banging on the door.
