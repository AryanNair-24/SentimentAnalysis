Battered sweeper robots w the plantings. Window-washers till the soil. The OAK TREE towers a hundred feet tall over the Concours Its branches brush the skylight far above. We move past walls decorated with murals and carvings. At the Concourse Bar, Arthur is slicing vegetables. His timeworn uniform mended by hand. At the aft end of the Concourse, a high wall. Here a long list of dates is inscribed. The last date is the ship's landfall on Homestead II; the first, Jim's awakening. In between: an accelerating tally of births, deaths, marriag catastrophes and achievements...a century of shipboard li At the base of the wall we find a table like an altar, wh a collection of artifacts is displayed: The meteor pried from the Excelsior's heart. Gus's worn shipcard, his picture still visible. A beautiful hand-bound book. In the Blink of an Eye: Our Lives Between the Stars, by Aurora Dunn. Beneath these printed words, a handwritten dedication: For Jim. In the center of it all, in the place of honor: the photo strip of Jim and Aurora from their first date. They laugh. They clown. She kisses him. Aurora looks into the camera's eye. Jim looks at Aurora.
