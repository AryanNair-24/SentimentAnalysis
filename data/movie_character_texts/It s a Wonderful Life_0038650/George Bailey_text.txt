22) 25) dialog: Yes, sir.
22) 27) text: George puts down his coat and comes around to the table,  incensed by what Potter is saying about his father.
22) 28) dialog: Just a minute В– just a minute. Now,  hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right  when you say my father was no business  man. I know that. Why he ever started  this cheap, penny-ante Building and  Loan, I'll never know. But neither  you nor anybody else can say anything  against his character, because his  whole life was... Why, in the twenty- five years since he and Uncle Billy  started this thing, he never once  thought of himself. Isn't that right,  Uncle Billy?  He didn't save enough  money to send Harry to school, let  alone me. But he did help a few people  get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.  And what's wrong with that? Why...   Here, you're all businessmen here.  Doesn't it make them better citizens?  Doesn't it make them better customers?  You... you said... What'd you say  just a minute ago?... They had to  wait and save their money before  they even ought to think of a decent  home. Wait! Wait for what? Until  their children grow up and leave  them?  Until they're so old and broken- down that they... Do you know how  long it takes a working man to save  five thousand dollars?  Just remember  this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble  you're talking about... they do most  of the working and paying and living  and dying in this community. Well,  is it too much to have them work and  pay and live and die in a couple of  decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my  father didn't think so. People were  human beings to him, but to you, a  warped, frustrated old man, they're  cattle. Well, in my book he died a  much richer man than you'll ever be!
22) 30) dialog: I know very well what you're talking  about. You're talking about something  you can't get your fingers on, and  it's galling you. That's what you're  talking about, I know. (to the Board) Well, I've said too much. I... You're  the Board here. You do what you want  with this thing. Just one thing more,  though. This town needs this measly  one-horse institution if only to  have some place where people can  come without crawling to Potter.  Come on, Uncle Billy!
22) 31) text: George leaves the room, followed by the jubilant Uncle Bi Potter's face is grim with hatred. The "frustrated old ma remark was gall in his veins.
23) 1) text: George, visibly shaken, is busy with his bag, his papers. is worried about the outcome of the meeting. Dissolving t Building and Loan will alter his plans. Uncle Billy follo him around, chattering.
