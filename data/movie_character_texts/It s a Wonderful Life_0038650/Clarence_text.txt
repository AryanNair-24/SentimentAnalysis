135) 1) text: The man in the water is Clarence, the angel whose voice w have heard speaking from Heaven. George reaches him, grab hold of him, and starts swimming for shore.
136) 1) text: George is seated before a wood-burning stove before which his clothes are drying on a line. He is in his long winte underwear.  He is sipping a mug of hot coffee, staring at the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring Clarence and tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsol problems.  Clarence is standing on the other side of the  stove, putting on his undershirt. This is a ludicrous  seventeenth century garment which looks like a baby's nig shirt В– with embroidered cuffs and collar, and gathered the neck with a drawstring. It falls below his knees.  Th tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them  suspiciously. Throughout the scene he attempts to spit, b each time is stopped by some amazing thing Clarence does says.  Clarence becomes aware that his garment is amazing the tollkeeper.
136) 2) dialog: I didn't have time to get some stylish  underwear. My wife gave me this on  my last birthday. I passed away in  it.
136) 3) text: The tollkeeper, about to spit, is stopped in the middle o it by this remark. Clarence, secretly trying to get Georg attention, now picks up a copy of "Tom Sawyer" which is  hanging on the line, drying. He shakes the book.
136) 4) dialog: Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.  You should read the new book Mark  Twain's writing now.
136) 7) dialog: I didn't fall in. I jumped in to  save George.
136) 10) dialog: Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go  through with it, did you?
136) 12) dialog: Suicide.
136) 15) dialog: Yeah, it's against the law where I  come from, too.
136) 17) text: He leans forward to spit, but is stopped by Clarence's ne statement.
136) 18) dialog: Heaven. (to George) I had to act quickly; that's why I  jumped in. I knew if I were drowning  you'd try to save me. And you see,  you did, and that's how I saved you.
136) 21) dialog: Your lip's bleeding, George.
136) 24) dialog: (comes around to George) Oh, no В– no В– no. I'm the answer to  your prayer. That's why I was sent  down here.
136) 26) dialog: Oh, I know all about you. I've watched  you grow up from a little boy.
136) 28) dialog: Oh, no.
136) 30) dialog: Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
136) 32) dialog: Angel, Second Class.

136) 39) dialog: That's what I was sent down for. I'm  your guardian angel.

136) 43) dialog: I told you В– I'm your guardian angel.  I know everything about you.
136) 45) dialog: I haven't won my wings yet. That's  why I'm an angel Second Class.

136) 49) dialog: By letting me help you.
136) 51) dialog: Oh, no, no. We don't use money in  Heaven.
136) 53) dialog: Oh, tut, tut, tut.
136) 55) dialog: Now look, you mustn't talk like that.  I won't get my wings with that  attitude. You just don't know all  that you've done. If it hadn't been  for you...
136) 57) dialog: No, you don't understand. I've got  my job...
136) 59) text: Clarence is not getting far with George. He glances up, p across the room, thoughtfully.
136) 60) dialog: (to himself) Hmmm, this isn't going to be so easy. (to George) So you still think killing yourself  would make everyone feel happier,  eh?
136) 62) dialog: What'd you say?
136) 64) dialog: Oh, you mustn't say things like that.   You... (gets an idea) ...wait a minute. Wait a minute.  That's an idea. (glances up toward  Heaven) What do you think? Yeah, that'll do  it.  All right. (to George) You've got your wish. You've never  been born.
136) 65) text: As Clarence speaks this line, the snow stops falling outs the building, a strong wind springs up which blows open t door to the shack. Clarence runs to close the door.
136) 66) dialog: (looking upward) You don't have to make all that fuss  about it.
136) 67) text: As Clarence speaks, George cocks his head curiously, favo his deaf ear, more interested in his hearing than in what Clarence has said.
136) 69) dialog: You've never been born. You don't  exist.  You haven't a care in the  world.
136) 70) text: George feels his ear as Clarence talks.
136) 71) dialog: No worries В– no obligations В– no  eight thousand dollars to get В– no  Potter looking for you with the  Sheriff.
136) 74) dialog: (bending down) Sure. You can hear out of it.
136) 76) dialog: Your lip's stopped bleeding, too,  George.
136) 81) dialog: Our clothes are dry.
136) 86) dialog: I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
137) 1) text: This is the same empty street where George's car swerved  into the tree near the sidewalk. George and Clarence come into shot and up to the spot where George had left his ca smashed against the tree. George looks around, but his ca is nowhere to be seen, and the tree is undamaged.
137) 2) dialog: What's the matter?
137) 4) dialog: You have no car.
137) 19) dialog: It isn't me!
137) 21) text: He puts his arm around Clarence, and they start off up th road.
137) 22) dialog: (as they go) Clarence!
138) 1) text: It is Martini's place, but almost unrecognizable. The che Italian feeling is gone. It is now more of a hard-drinkin joint, a honky-tonk. Same bar, tables have no covers. Peo are lower down and tougher. Nick the bartender is behind bar. George and Clarence come in. George does not notice difference, but Clarence is all eyes and beaming. They go to the bar.
138) 12) dialog: I was just thinking... (face puckers up with  delicious anticipation) It's been so long since I...
138) 14) dialog: (appreciatively) That's a good man. I was just thinking  of a flaming rum punch. No, it's not  cold enough for that. Not nearly  cold enough...  Wait a minute...  wait a minute... I got it. Mulled  wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light  on the cloves. Off with you, me lad,  and be lively!
138) 16) text: As he says this, Nick leans over the counter and puts his left fist nearly in Clarence's eye. Clarence is puzzled b this conduct.
138) 17) dialog: (to George) What's he talking about?
138) 22) dialog: You'll see a lot of strange things  from now on.
138) 24) dialog: No.
138) 27) dialog: No.
138) 29) dialog: I jumped in the river to save you so  I could get my wings.
138) 32) text: A cash register bell rings off stage. Clarence reacts to SOUND of the bell.
138) 33) dialog: Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
138) 35) dialog: Every time you hear a bell ring, it  means that some angel's just got his  wings.
138) 38) dialog: Why? Don't they believe in angels?
138) 40) dialog: Then why should they be surprised  when they see one?
138) 42) dialog: Two hundred and ninety-three... (thinks) ...next May.
139) 1) text: George and Clarence come flying through the door and land the snow.
141) 1) text: George and Clarence lying in the snow. George has a stran puzzled look on his face. They remain for a moment as the landed, looking at each other.

141) 4) text: George catches a glimpse of the front of the building wit the neon sign over the door. It now reads "NICK'S PLACE"  instead of "MARTINI'S." George and Clarence get to their feet.

141) 8) dialog: (patiently) I told you, George. I'm your guardian  angel.
141) 11) dialog: No, of course not.
141) 13) dialog: Don't you understand, George? It's  because you were not born.
141) 15) dialog: You're nobody. You have no identity.
141) 18) dialog: There is no George Bailey. You have  no papers, no cards, no driver's  license, no 4-F card, no insurance  policy... (he says these things  as George searches  for them) George looks in his watch pocket.
141) 19) dialog: They're not there, either.
141) 21) dialog: Zuzu's petals.
141) 23) dialog: You've been given a great gift,  George. A chance to see what the  world would be like without you.
141) 26) text: He starts off. Clarence rises.
141) 27) dialog: Home? What home?
141) 29) text: George strides off hurriedly. Clarence slowly follows him glancing up toward Heaven as he goes.
141) 30) dialog: How'm I doing, Joseph. Thanks. (pause) No, I didn't have a drink!
148) 3) text: Clarence suddenly appears leaning against a wall.
148) 4) dialog: They're not here, George. You have  no children.
149) 15) text: Bert raises his gun to hit George on the head. As he does so, Clarence darts in and fixes his teeth in Bert's wrist forcing him to let George go.
149) 16) dialog: Run... George! Run, George!
149) 17) text: George dashes out of the house and down the street, as Be grapples with Clarence, and they fall to the ground,  wrestling. We see Bert kneeling, trying to put handcuffs Clarence.

149) 21) text: Suddenly Clarence disappears from under Bert's hands. Ber gets up, amazed by his vanishing.
151) 1) text: George stands a moment, stunned. Then he turns and runs o to the sidewalk, until his face fills the screen. His fea are distorted by the emotional chaos within him. We see  Clarence leaning on the mail box at the curb, holding his volume of "Tom Sawyer" in his hand.
151) 2) dialog: Strange, isn't it?  Each man's life  touches so many other lives, and  when he isn't around he leaves an  awful hole, doesn't he?
151) 4) dialog: You know where he lives?
152) 1) text: George and Clarence approach the tree from which the "Bai Park" sign once hung. Now it is just outside a cemetery,  with graves where the houses used to be.
152) 2) dialog: Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
152) 5) dialog: (as they go) You weren't here to build them.
152) 6) text: George wandering like a lost soul among the tombstones,  Clarence trotting at his heels. Again George stops to sta with frightened eyes at:
152) 10) dialog: Your brother, Harry Bailey, broke  through the ice and was drowned at  the age of nine.
152) 13) dialog: (sadly) Every man on that transport died.  Harry wasn't there to save them  because you weren't there to save  Harry. You see, George, you really  had a wonderful life.  Don't you see  what a mistake it would be to throw  it away?
152) 16) dialog: Yes, George?
152) 18) dialog: Oh, well, I can't...
152) 20) text: George grabs Clarence by the coat collar and shakes him.
152) 21) dialog: I...
152) 23) dialog: I'm not supposed to tell.
152) 25) dialog: You're not going to like it, George.
152) 27) dialog: She's an old maid. She never married.
152) 29) dialog: She's...
152) 31) dialog: (in self-defense) She's just about to close up the  library!
152) 32) text: George lets Clarence go, and runs off. Clarence falls to ground, where he rubs his neck.
152) 33) dialog: (to himself) There must be some easier way for me  to get my wings.
154) 12) text: George can't fight through the men holding him. Desperate he thinks of Clarence, and heads for the door.
155) 3) text: He grabs for George, who lets him have one square on the  button, knocking him down, then continues running down th street yelling for Clarence. Bert gets up, takes out his and fires several shots after the fleeing figure.
