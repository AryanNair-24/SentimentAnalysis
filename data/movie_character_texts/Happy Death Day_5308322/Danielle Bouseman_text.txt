13) 3) dialog: I have it all the time. It’s supposed to mean somebody’s like walking over your grave or something.

TREE’S BEDROOM - LATER Tree has dismantled her Ikea night stand and is nailing the wood panels over the windows. Finished, she gives them a good tug to be sure they’re secure.

She settles onto her bed and begins peeling the paper off of her treat. About to take a bite, Tree notices the “Road Rules” marathon is still playing. It feels like a bad omen, she opts for a station change. Tree begins searching for the remote but it’s nowhere to be found.

The party at the Sigma house tonight is a surprise birthday party for your ungrateful-ass so I suggest you suck it up and go. Just don’t even try talking to me when you’re there. Got it? 83. Danielle storms out, slamming the door behind her. Instead of getting upset, Tree grabs the cupcake Lori made her and peels-off the paper shell. She’s about to take a bite when... BLACKOUT.
