1) 0) text: The morning sunlight gleams off the great IRON CAST BELL as it continues ringing, but at its normal speed. From this high up we can see how isolated the school is - surrounded on one side by thick forest. A small campus, mostly brick and ivy. In the Quad, a fraction of the students amble to their classes. We glimpse the highlights: THE FOOTBALL FIELD. SORORITY ROW. AN ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING. THE DORMS. INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING A boxed shrine to hip. From the “BLADE RUNNER” and vintage “STAR WARS” posters to the book shelf lined with plastic-sealed comics. Tangled in black skull and crossbone sheets, we find TERESA “Tree” GELBMAN, 19, beautiful. Outside, the bell tolls one final time before a calm settles over the room. The quiet doesn’t last long as Tree’s CELL PHONE plays “Happy Birthday”. Tree stirs through the fog of her hang-over, searching for her phone. As she sits up, several things hit her at once: she’s not in her room, she's wearing a guy's T- shirt, and the guy it probably belongs to is bent down, putting something away under the couch. CARTER DAVIS, 19, good looks hidden behind grunge and stubble, turns around and smiles at Tree.
1) 1) dialog: You’re up. I wasn’t --
1) 3) text: On the night stand. Tree fishes her phone out -- 1 missed call from “DAD”. She snaps it shut with an exasperated sigh. Tree pulls off the T-shirt, exposing a black lace bra. Carter quickly turns his back to her. CARTER (CONT’D) I don’t know if you remember my name. You were pretty wasted last night. I’m Car--
1) 5) dialog: What?
1) 7) dialog: Uh, sure. Hold on a sec. He starts rummaging through the debris of his room while Tree finishes getting dressed. Carter finds a bottle of aspirin in a TOILETRY BAG that was hidden under a pair of jeans. He offers her a pill. She snatches the bottle and dumps three in her hand and dry-swallows them like a pro.
1) 8) dialog: I’m Carter.
1) 10) dialog: Sure... Tree starts to leave. The door is covered in a collage of band stickers and other bits and strips of randomness. In the middle of it all is a BUMPER STICKER that proclaims: “TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE” Tree opens the door and collides with a lanky FRESHMAN. The words are already leaving his mouth:
1) 11) text: Dude! Did you hit that fine-vagine or what?! He meets Tree’s hard stare and instantly shrinks. Tree pushes past him. Carter shoots the freshman a look.
1) 12) dialog: Nice one, dickweed. Carter’s eyes fall on Tree’s GOLD BRACELET, lying on the floor, as it catches the light from the open window. She must have knocked it off the night stand in her haste.
4) 9) dialog: I’m so sorry, Tree.
4) 12) dialog: (sheepish) We...had a class together last year. Tree snatches the napkins from him and starts wiping herself down. CARTER (CONT’D) I just came by to return this. 10. He offers Tree her bracelet. CARTER (CONT’D) I didn’t know where you lived-- Tree snatches it back and looks around to see if anybody saw the exchange. Luckily, they didn’t. He waits for a “thank you”.
4) 14) dialog: Sorry again about the mess. Carter walks off.
11) 3) dialog: You’re up. I wasn’t -- 18.
11) 5) dialog: Uh...on the night stand. Tree fishes her phone out of her jeans -- 1 missed call from “DAD”. She snaps the phone shut. Tree starts changing into her clothes. Carter turns around. CARTER (CONT’D) I don’t know if you remember my name. You were pretty wasted last night. I’m Car--
11) 8) dialog: What?
11) 10) dialog: Uh, sure. Hold on a sec. Carter begins searching. Tree grows inpatient and grabs his TOILETRY BAG under some clothes. She finds the bottle and dumps the pills in her hand. CARTER (CONT’D) (laughing) Wow. Have you been here before? The question makes Tree pause. How did she know where the aspirin was? CARTER (CONT’D) You okay? 19. Tree is still thinking.
11) 11) dialog: Tree? She turns and looks at his door -- there’s the sticker: “TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE” Suddenly, the door opens. Enter lanky freshman...
11) 13) dialog: Nice one, dickweed.
14) 8) dialog: I’m so sorry, Tree.
14) 10) dialog: No. Yes. Tree slowly turns and looks at Carter -- he sees the fear in her eyes. Translates it quickly:
14) 11) dialog: We...had a class together last year. (to Tree) Sorry again. He starts to walk off.
14) 14) dialog: Oh. Yeah. Here-- Reaching into his pocket, he drops it into the palm of her hand. For a split-second Tree pauses -- how did she know he had it on him? Tree finally turns around and walks away.
23) 16) dialog: Everything. ..okay? Cue “Happy Birthday” from Trees cell phone. She grabs the phone from her clothes on the night stand.
23) 17) text: INCOMING CALL FROM “DAD” On the brink of hysteria, Tree grabs her clothes and starts changing. Carter turns his back to her. 37. CARTER (CONT’D) I don’t know if you remember my name. You were --
23) 19) dialog: Yeah.
23) 21) dialog: (perking-up) Yeah.
23) 23) dialog: Not until last night. I mean, I’ve seen you around campus but we don’t exactly move in the same circles. Tree’s eyes fill with tears.
23) 25) dialog: (hurt/defensive) I’m sorry...but you’re the one who wanted to come here last night! Tree shoves him out of the way and runs for the door. She sees the sticker again.
27) 2) dialog: What’s wrong?! Jumping out of bed too quickly, Tree suddenly doubles- over in pain. Carter rushes to her side.
27) 3) dialog: Tree --- She shoves him back. Her cell phone plays “Happy Birthday”. Tree grabs the phone and throws it against the wall.
27) 7) dialog: What’s wrong? Are you sick?
27) 9) dialog: I don’t know what’s going on but -- 50. Carter turns around -- Tree’s already out the door. A second later, the lanky freshman peeks into Carter's room.
41) 0) text: Danielle and the other Kappa girls stare in horror/disgust as Tree (sporting her new-do) sprays a bottle of Cheeze-Wiz into her open mouth. EXT. GREGORY’S HOUSE - NIGHT Gregory escorts Stephanie (he’s in a tux, she’s ina gown) out of their up-scale house. CLOSE ON -- THE PAD as Stephanie’s name is crossed out. Gregory's sedan pulls out of the circular driveway -- Tree is suddenly tackled by her killer! Tree falls backward into a KOI POND. She manages to knock the mask off, but the killer shoves her head UNDERWATER... Tree’s POV -- through the rippling water, she can’t make out the identity of her attacker. INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING Tree wakes up and instantly leans over Carter’s bedside to puke a stream of pond-water. On Carter: gross!
44) 5) dialog: I don’t know if you-- She holds her hand up.
44) 7) dialog: How did you... He watches Tree pour 2...3...6 pills into the palm of her hand. CARTER (CONT’D) I don’t think you’re supposed to take that many. You could die.
44) 13) dialog: Are you always this charming in the morning?
44) 15) dialog: So...bad dream?
44) 17) dialog: You were screaming before you fell out of bed.
44) 20) dialog: I’ve got nothing to do.
44) 24) dialog: I hate when people start something and they don’t finish.
45) 0) text: Tree puts her shoes on just outside the dorm. Carter is still tailing her.
45) 1) dialog: So you’re having bad dreams. I took an elective course on neurocognition and dream content.
45) 3) dialog: Maybe I can help?
45) 6) dialog: You literally think you’re re- living the same day?
45) 8) dialog: And somebody kills you?
45) 11) dialog: Come on. You’re just messing with me, right? You don’t seriously think you’re re-living the same day? Annoyed, Tree stops.
45) 13) dialog: What? Just then, the CAR ALARM goes off. Tree turns, facing the pair studying on the lawn.
45) 16) dialog: Yeah? 73.
46) 0) text: Muzak plays softly in the background as Tree noisily sucks down the last drops of her Oreo Blizzard through a straw. Carter is staring at her, mouth agape.
46) 2) dialog: Sorry. I’m just trying to work this whole thing out.
46) 4) dialog: I guess it’s kinda like that movie “Groundhog’s Day”, only you're not Bill Murray and instead of zany- fun you're being violently butchered.
46) 6) dialog: First of all, I wouldn’t classify myself as a nerd.
46) 8) dialog: Whatever. Just because I like science fiction doesn’t make me an expert on crazy chicks trapped in the same day. Tree looks down, a little hurt. Carter feels bad. CARTER (CONT’D) Look, if I were you I would stop trying to figure out how it was happening and start figuring out why.
46) 10) dialog: There has to be a reason you’re stuck in this day. Out of all the days of your life, this day must have some kind of meaning.
46) 12) dialog: (off the ring-tone) It’s your birthday? CARTER (CONT’D) Hello?!
46) 14) dialog: It’s symbolic! Whoever is killing you knows it’s your birthday! 75.
46) 15) dialog: Here -— Carter unfolds a napkin and removes a PEN from his shirt pocket. Tree stares at the pen. CARTER (CONT’D) Okay. That's nerdy. Let’s move on. Who knows it’s your birthday today and who would want to kill you?
46) 17) dialog: Who's Gregory?
46) 19) dialog: Nice.
46) 21) dialog: For the record, I didn’t take advantage of you. I slept on the couch.
46) 23) dialog: No. You were wasted and I was worried you’d fall or choke on your own vomit like Janis Joplin. 76. Sitting across from her in the booth, Tree discovers two things about Carter: he’s probably the sweetest guy in the whole world and he’s actually kinda cute. But she’s not letting her guard down.
46) 25) dialog: Yeah, I can see that. Tree manages a laugh. It’s the first time we’ve seen her smile like this.
47) 0) text: Carter is walking Tree back to her house. The sun is out, the flowers are in bloom, and if they weren’t talking about Tree dying violently every day, the moment would almost seem romantic.
47) 1) dialog: There has to be somebody you didn’t think of.
47) 3) dialog: But it could be somebody who knows you but you don’t necessarily know them.
47) 6) dialog: You just said you’d have to spend the rest of your life dying. (MORE)
47) 8) dialog: It was ironic. (off Tree’s blank expression) Get it...”rest of your life dying”... (she’s still not laughing) Sorry. I'll shut up now. They reach Tree’s house. She plops-down on the short wall and releases an exasperated sigh of defeat. CARTER (CONT’D) Can I ask you a dumb question?
47) 10) dialog: Why don’t you just leave the country?
47) 12) dialog: Look, my parents gave me a credit card for emergencies. You have a driver’s license, right? Tree nods. CARTER (CONT’D) That’s it, then. We’ll put you on a plane. Europe. Mexico. Whatever. By the time you get there it’1ll be tomorrow. Even if they send you back cause you don’t have a passport it’1ll still be the next day. You’ll be home free!
47) 14) dialog: My parents will freak when they get the bill but if it means keeping you alive...yeah. Of course. 78. PRELAP: A HORN beeping... INT. CARTER’S VW JETTA - DUSK Carter and Tree are stuck in a long line of cars trailing back from the interstate on-ramp.
47) 16) dialog: So, apart from the obvious reasons, why are you so down on your birthday?
47) 19) dialog: And you've had to share it all your life and it pisses you off?
47) 21) dialog: She died, huh? Tree nods as she shoves her hurt back down.
47) 23) dialog: Sorry. That sucks.
47) 28) dialog: Who?
47) 31) dialog: What?!
47) 33) dialog: Tree, I’m getting you out of here! Reaching over, Tree grabs the steering wheel.
48) 0) text: The car behind Carter SLAMS on its breaks as Carter’s car flips a bitch, swerving into oncoming traffic! Narrowly escaping a major accident, Carter slips into the flow of traffic heading BACK TOWARDS campus.
48) 1) text: Shaking his head disapprovingly as he continues to direct cars. INT. CARTER’S CAR - CONTINUOUS Checking his rear-view mirror, Carter sighs with a mix of relief and frustration.
48) 2) dialog: Are you crazy?!
48) 4) dialog: So then what?
54) 3) dialog: You’re up. I wasn’t -- Weak but elated to see him alive, Tree jumps out of bed and throws her arms around Carter.
54) 5) dialog: No biggie. She pulls away as her cell phone plays “Happy Birthday”. By the time she retrieves it, she’s missed her dad’s call.
54) 7) dialog: I don’t know if you remember my name --
54) 10) dialog: Uh...sure. Why not?
57) 8) dialog: Oh my god! I’m so sorry!
57) 11) dialog: I didn’t mean to-- Tree grabs him and plants a big kiss on his lips. She finally pulls away. Carter’s eyes are as wide as saucers. CARTER (CONT’D) What was that for? “Happy Birthday” starts playing again on Tree’s cell phone. It’s dad again.
57) 13) dialog: Um...nothing.
57) 16) dialog: Okay. What’s the punch-line?
57) 18) dialog: Yes? Tree pecks him on the cheek. As she heads off, Carter looks at Becky -- they both share confused grins.
61) 0) text: The police have gone, the ordeal is finally over. Carter is walking Tree to her house.
61) 1) dialog: So this has to be strangest birthday you've ever had.
61) 3) dialog: Did the police say how Tombs got free?
61) 5) dialog: Like Houdini.
61) 8) dialog: It’s okay. There’s always tomorrow. Tree glances at her watch. It’s 11:53 pm.
61) 11) dialog: Night. She goes inside. Carter lingers for a moment, totally smitten. INT. TREE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT Tree’s a little surprised to find the room empty. Lori must be out with her “new man”. But she left something behind... THE CUPCAKE. Tree grabs a book of matches sitting on a box of incense. She lights the candle on the cupcake. 101. Sitting down on her bed, Tree closes her eyes. Thinking of a wish. Love? Money? Fame? Doesn’t matter. She’s alive. Tree opens her eyes and blows.
61) 17) dialog: You’re up. I wasn’t --
61) 19) dialog: I didn’t think you’d remember my name. You were pretty wasted last night. Tree’s cell phone plays “Happy Birthday”. She grabs the phone...the caller ID says “DAD”.
61) 22) dialog: (alarmed) Who? What are you talking about? She pulls her T-shirt off. Carter spins around. CARTER (CONT’D) You probably just had a bad dream. It happens to me whenever I drink too much. But when he turns around, Tree’s already gone. He frowns. CARTER (CONT’D) (to himself) Nice one, dickweed.
65) 0) text: Tree wakes up in the hospital bed. Beside her is Carter and her dad.
65) 6) dialog: You're not supposed to move. You've been banged up pretty bad. She lets them lower her back down. CARTER (CONT’D) Do you remember anything?
65) 12) dialog: You still owe me a date. Tree smiles. They leave. Alone with Dr. Winter: Tree winces.
65) 23) text: INT. CARTER’S DORM ROOM - MORNING The bell tolls outside. Tree stirs from her slumber. She sits up...notices she’s wearing the same oversized T- shirt.
65) 25) text: It says: PRIVATE NUMBER Tree: What? Carter turns around, holding his cell phone. He laughs as he snaps it shut. Tree’s cell phone instantly stops ringing as she realizes he was just fucking with her.
65) 27) dialog: Hilarious. Grabbing a pillow, Tree takes a swing and misses. Carter tackles Tree onto the bed. Pinning her down, he goes in for the kiss... But Tree suddenly pushes him back -- she looks worried. CARTER (CONT’D) What’s wrong? 111.
