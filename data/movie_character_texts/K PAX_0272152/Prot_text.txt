11) 29) dialog: (between bites) Actually, there are ten, but that doesn't matter - I'm not from your solar system. K-PAX is about a thousand of your light years from here. Near what you call your Constellation LYRA.

Powell stares back at him, at a complete loss.

17) 29) dialog: (searching for just how to say it) It's a ... painful procedure.
17) 32) dialog: It is associated with the entire Process. I am aware these activities result in pleasurable sensations for you humans. But for us, the effect is quite the opposite. This applies for both the males and females of our species - and incidentally - for most other beings around the Galaxy.
17) 34) dialog: It's more like having your gonads caught in a vice, except we feel it all over. To make matters worse, the sensation is associated with something like your nausea, accompanied by a very bad smell. The moment of climax is like being kicked in the stomach and falling into a pool of mot shit. Powell can't believe he's going along with this. Prot laughs. a pencil and a little RED NOTEBOOK
17) 36) dialog: A mot is a being much like your skunk, only far more potent.
17) 38) dialog: Like your porcupines. As carefully as possible. Needless to say, overpopulation is not a problem for us. Then, as Powell watches, incredulous, starts jotting a note of his own. POWELL . What - what are you doing? 26.

22) 4) dialog: Bess. She does not speak. Why is that?
22) 9) dialog: What would you like to know?
22) 11) dialog: (finding this funny) No one has a "job" on K-PAX. Really, Mark, is it that difficult to understand? On K-PAX, if something needs to be done, you do it.
22) 13) dialog: There are no humans on K~PAX.
22) 15) dialog: Besides, there's nothing that needs to be done that is really unpleasant. Look, you defecate, don't you? Powell gives him a ridiculous look.
22) 20) dialog: Do you find it unpleasant?
22) 22) dialog: Do you get someone to do it for you?
22) 24) dialog: But you don't, and you don't think twice about it. You just do it. And it does have its rewards, right? Powell resists the temptation to laugh.
22) 30) dialog: Things are not the same on K-PAX as they are on Earth, Mark. We don't have "families" as you know them. The idea of a 'family' would be a non sequitur on our planet - and most others, I might add.
22) 32) dialog: Exactly, now you've got it.
22) 34) dialog: On K~PAX, children are not raised by their biological parents, but by everyone. They circulate among us, learning from one, then another ...
22) 36) dialog: No one on K-PAX has more than one child. There is little reason to, since the average lifespan of a K-PAXian is a thousand of your years.
22) 38) dialog: (quickly) No.
22) 42) dialog: Mark, Mark, Mark. You haven't been idistening. We don't have marriage on K-PAX - no husbands, no wives, no families ~ get it? To put it more correctly, the entire population is one big family.
22) 44) dialog: There is no need for one.
22) 46) dialog: No laws, no lawyers.
22) 48) dialog: (as if this were a stupid guestion) Every being knows what's right and wrong.
22) 53) dialog: Let me tell you something, Marko. Most humans subscribe to the policy of "an eye for an eye," "a life for a life." Most of your religions are famous for this formula, known throughout the Universe for its stupidity. Your Christ and your Buddha had a different vision, but nobody paid any attention to them, not even the Christians and Buddhists. So, no. On K~PAX beings do not kill other beings, but if they did there'd be no punishment. Apparantly this is impossible for Earth beings to understand, but it's the secret of life, believe me.
22) 55) dialog: You humans. Sometimes it's hard to imagine how you've made it this far. Crime is less popular than sex, even. There's simply no need for it.

26) 5) dialog: You seem overly upset, Mark. To borrow a phrase from Raul ~ you need to "chill." (MORE)
26) 9) dialog: (with a smile) For your information - every being has the Capability to cure themselves. This is something we have known on K-PAX for millions of years.
26) 11) dialog: Doctor - patient. Curious human distinction.
26) 13) dialog: Then, why haven't you cured them yet? As Powell stares at Prot, fishing for a reply -~ Prot carefully takes out several folded NOTEBOOK PAGES, h them to him.

41) 20) dialog: How about a demonstration? Powell's expression becomes uncertain. He catches a wary sidelong glance from Chakraborty.
41) 22) dialog: Adios! Aloha! He sits there with a wide grin.

Powell has to smile, a bit sadly, as he regards Prot, see what a farce this is becoming. When Flynn attempts to be serious again, perusing Prot's notebook PAGES in front of him.
41) 33) dialog: (delighted) My pleasure. He gets up, goes over to the lightpad, picks up the stylu there. Unsure, he looks back at the scientists. They nod. Prot makes a mark on the lightpad over the projector. He looks up. It appears as a scribble across the STAR SYSTEM He shakes his head, erases it, then starts again, animate looking up to the stars with every mark he makes. The scientists lean back in their chairs with bafflingly amused expressions. But as Prot's scribbles take shape up ABOVE THEM ... thei expressions begin to change ... For there ... projected over the STARS ... emerges a coge detailed DIAGRAM of what looks like a 4-PLANET SOLAR SYST around the two brightest stars. Complete with a grid of ANGLES and FORMULAS of relative distances. Prot looks up, puts down the stylus, satisfied. Flynn, slowly, takes the pipe out of his mouth.
