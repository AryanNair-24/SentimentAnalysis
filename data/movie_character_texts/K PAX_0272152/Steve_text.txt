29) 0) text: Steve's expression says otherwise, as he examines Prot's HANDWRITING on the pages spread out before him.
29) 1) dialog: Well ... not exactly. See ~ your patient indicates his planet "K-PAX" orbiting an eclipsing binary star system, Agape and Satori, near the constellation Lyra.
31) 1) dialog: That's the funny thing, Mark. Not really. You see ... except for my boss, Duncan Flynn, who's one of the foremost astrophysicists in the world, and maybe - two or three of his colleagues ~ nobody knows much about the possibility of planets in this star system yet. It hasn't even been reported in any journals. He looks around the observatory, lowering his voice into phone, with a shrewd smile:
31) 2) dialog: Tell me, honestly. Duncan put you up to this? You know, like a joke?

41) 7) dialog: (smiles at Prot) Feel at home? Flynn clears his throat, trying as hard as he can to trea Prot seriously.
41) 19) dialog: Well, then, I wonder if you could show us how this light travel works.
41) 21) dialog: (surprised) That would be ... fine.
41) 25) dialog: When are you going to ...
41) 27) dialog: Where I come from, that's called the fastest gun in the West routine.
41) 35) dialog: Already on it. Steve has the Princeton Observatory database on line. As maltiple STAR CHARTS and theoretical CHARTS appear on his MONITOR, he hurriedly inputs Prot's information from the Powell looks from Prot's diagram to the scientists, confu

42) 2) dialog: I don't know what I believe, Mark. But, I know what I saw. Tell you what I'm going to do ... I'm going to computer generate a star chart of the night sky as seen from the position of this planet K-PAX. Ask your man to draw one from memory. Then send it to me. If his matches mine - I guarantee you the government would take him off your hands. Powell just stares, maddeningly, at his brother-in-law. 40 41

121) 1) text: Now Steve leans over to the phone again.
121) 2) dialog: See, Mark, the chart I generated was for the night sky as we see it from Earth ~- only transposed one thousand light years to where K-PAX is supposed to be. But ... I made a mistake. You see, from one thousand light years - werd have a slightly different view of A4S5. He holds PROT'S MAP next to yet another SCREEN ... on whi there is a very large white star that seems to coincide - exactly - with Prot's TWO SMUDGES.
121) 3) dialog: We've analyzed Prot's map and compared the coordinates to the known star field. Where we thought there was only a neutron star, he has drawn what appears to be a star and an accretion isc. 116c*. €125 ae ee eR EE
