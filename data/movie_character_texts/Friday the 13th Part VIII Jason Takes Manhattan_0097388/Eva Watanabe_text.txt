22) 20) text: A sexy, money-dressed blonde is behind the wheel. TAMARA  MASON. She climbs from her leather seats as a trio of  SENIOR GIRLS walk by, offering enthusiastic hi's and  hellos. She's obviously Miss Popular. Tamara crosses to a cute Japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige Honda,  EVA WATANABE.
22) 25) dialog: Don't worry about a thing, Mom. I'll  have a terrific time and I won't do  anything stupid, okay? Before Mrs. Watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter  is gone. She waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate.
22) 29) dialog: Really?
22) 32) dialog: He bought you that?
23) 7) text: Congratulations on the 3.9 average,  Miss Watanabe. You're in stateroom two- fifty-five. Eva smiles awkwardly, reaching for her luggage, stalling  to see what happens with Tamara.
23) 10) dialog: She's telling the truth, Mr.  McCulloch. I saw her pack it. He's surprised to hear this...and so is Tamara.
23) 14) dialog: What are you going to do?
40) 0) text: as Toby runs straight toward us. PAN with him as he  rushes around a corner, leading us into a view of TAMARA  and EVA, disappearing down a staircase.
41) 2) dialog: I'm not sure we're supposed to be  here, Tamara. A couple of skinny boys wearing only towels walk by. But  Tamara doesn't notice them, her face pressed up against  the glass, watching Julius.
41) 6) dialog: (awkward)
41) 12) dialog: Sounds good. I hear there's a  shuffleboard court on deck -- it might  be kinds cool...
43) 0) text: as Tamara drags Eva into a secluded service area, pulling out her mirror, straw and baggie.
43) 2) dialog: (nervous)
43) 5) dialog: It's not that, it's just that... (beat)
43) 8) dialog: (a pause)
43) 21) dialog: I have her in Creative Writing and  she's fairly nice.
44) 7) dialog: Do you think I would use drugs, Mr.  McCulloch? We were just exploring the  ship. He doesn't want to believe Eva is a druggie. But Tamara  is a different matter. He levels his eyes on her.
44) 11) dialog: What are you going to do?
46) 23) dialog: (feels like shit)
46) 26) dialog: I think I'll pass. See you later,  okay?
65) 0) text: The wooden shuffleboard disks are drowning in  precipitation. Eva stands alone in the rain, staring at  the court as Sean's voice continues.
74) 0) text: as Julius and his followers continue on, passing Eva,  who's coming up from a staircase. She stops Wayne.
74) 1) dialog: What's going on? I heard on the P.A.  system that...
74) 4) dialog: Jason...Voorhees? She knows the legend as weld as everybody else. Wayne  nods gravely, moving to catch up with the others. Eva  rushes up to him again.
74) 5) dialog: Have you seen Tamara?
74) 7) dialog: But she might be in trouble...
74) 9) text: Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude  to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise  up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
74) 10) dialog: I don't care about being hip anymore. She means it. Wayne nods with understanding.
76) 3) dialog: Tamara? Are you around here anywhere? Jason quietly closes the door. Rennie will have to wait.
77) 0) dialog: as she cautiously walks along, poking her head in every  alcove.
77) 1) dialog: Tamara?
78) 0) dialog: (STEADICAM)
78) 1) text: Eva steps into the hallway outside Tamara's stateroom.  She walks up to Tamara's door, knocking on it. It swings  open, unlocked.
78) 2) dialog: Tamara? (no response)
78) 3) text: I just want to talk with you. She steps into Tamara's room and we go in with her. The  quarters are empty. Eva stands there for a beat, confused and scared. She's about to leave when a CREAKING SOUND  causes her to look back at:
78) 7) dialog: shrieks, running back out the door...
79) 0) text: ...and sliding to a abrupt halt because JASON IS STANDING AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY. He moves toward Eva like a  bulldozer. She turns a rapid 180 and sprints in retreat.
80) 0) text: Empty for a second, then Eva appears, weaving her way  through a maze of corridors and passageways. She races  past a sign directing passengers to "CLUB RUBY."
81) 0) text: The thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune  precedes Eva as she tears open a door, entering the  corridor. MOVE BACKWARDS WITH HER as she rushes forward,  curving through the shallow passageway and emptying out  onto a high tech DISCO FLOOR. A flashing Star Wars  lighting system assaults her all directions along with  the music. She's all alone in here.
81) 3) dialog: decides this is the wrong place to be. She moves for the  corridor again and:
81) 5) dialog: backs away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor  like she's on a building ledge. Chaser lights and mirror  balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the  point where she last saw him. But:
81) 7) dialog: whirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the  sight of him. Camera SPINS with her in 360 degree arcs,  PUSHING IN on her face.
81) 9) dialog: stops, looking everywhere.
