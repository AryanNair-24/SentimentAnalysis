9) 0) text: as Jim slides on top of Suzy. Thoughts of Jason are  starting to slip away along with their clothes.
17) 0) text: A deadly-sharp SPEAR GUN rests in its rack outside the  cabin. JASON'S HAND REMOVES IT.
18) 0) text: The sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each  other. Thoughts of Jason are nonexistent now.
18) 7) dialog: raises the spear, taking aim.
19) 0) text: as the HOUSEBOAT silently drifts onward. The lone  silhouette of Jason emerges from within, taking the helm. He's back.
22) 35) text: Sure enough, it's the same one we saw JASON on last  night...but no one is behind the helm. It seems to be a  ghost ship.
29) 1) text: The water begins to ripple as the ship's speed increases. All seems normal...until JASON'S HANDS APPEAR, CLINGING  TO A LOOSE MOORING LINE DRAGGING IN THE WATER. He  slithers up the side towards the deck as dense fog  breezes past him.
33) 8) dialog: emerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare.
35) 0) text: as Jason tears the guitar off her body, raising it in the air like a hatchet. The horrified girl flees down a  narrow maze of steel steps, forced back against a  generator with nowhere to go. PUSH IN on her face for one last look at her before:
35) 1) dialog: swings the guitar downward and buries it in J.J.'s skull.
39) 0) text: Wind is picking up, sweeping thick mist past a row of  decorative flags. One of them flaps back...AND EXPOSES  JASON.
54) 0) text: as Rennie enters, her eyes reddened. She moves to the  sink, looking at herself in the mirror. So much for the  silk blouse and satin pants, not to mention her soaked  hair. Rennie runs some warm water, rinsing her face. When she starts to fill her hands a second time, BLOOD  POURS OUT THE FAUCET INSTEAD OF WATER. Rennie gasps,  jerking up and seeing YOUNG JASON REFLECTED ON THE OTHER  SIDE OF THE MIRROR, SPLASHING IN WATER.
55) 1) text: as Tamara reaches for her robe, slipping it on. Her body  paint has been washed off.  She steps from the shower, glancing in her vanity mirror  AND SEEING THE REAL JASON REFLECTED IN IT. Tamara spins  around, looking face to face with JASON IN HER BATHROOM.  Just as she SCREAMS:
56) 0) text: Young Jason reaches out to grab Rennie, HIS FIST CRASHING THROUGH THE MIRROR. Right when Rennie SCREAMS:
57) 0) text: The real Jason SHATTERS TAMARA'S VANITY MIRROR WITH HIS  FIST. He grabs a sharp chunk of it, advancing on a  whimpering Tamara.
59) 9) dialog: holding the opposite end of the harpoon. He shoves it  forward with one more staccato jerk and:
59) 13) dialog: hovering over him, now clutching one of the scaling  knives.
69) 0) text: as LIGHTNING STRIKES above it in the night sky. Camera  slowly ADJUSTS to find the RADIO ANTENNA CABLE. A second  later, JASON'S HAND REACHES FOR IT, GETTING A FIRM GRASP.
71) 0) text: as Jason drops the cable he's just torn out, marching  onward.
74) 3) text: The Captain's been murdered. The buzz  is that Jason might be on board.
76) 0) text: moving closer to the right anchor hoist, her back to us  as well as Jason. She climbs behind the hoist, looking at the consoles. Then suddenly a BARK.
79) 0) text: ...and sliding to a abrupt halt because JASON IS STANDING AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY. He moves toward Eva like a  bulldozer. She turns a rapid 180 and sprints in retreat.
80) 1) dialog: --entering the same corridor a beat after Eva exits it in the direction of the disco. He tramples onward.
81) 4) dialog: appears on the corridor steps for a brief second. The  spotlight goes black, then flashes on again. Now he's  gone.
81) 6) dialog: illuminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe  assaulting his hockey mask. She's on a collision course  with him.
84) 6) text: We're talking the possibility of Jason  Voorhees here. Julius pauses. He's not stupid.
87) 22) dialog: hoists him off of J.J.'s body and flings him into:
88) 14) text: We PAN across them, stopping on one labeled "FIRE ALARM - DO NOT BREAK EXCEPT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY." Camera  continues around to find we are in the POWER ROOM, NOT on the bridge. Our vision suddenly lands on JASON, staring  at the alarm button, considering. He glances back over  his shoulder.
96) 0) text: as Miles arrives, axe raised. He pauses to regard his  surroundings, then moves on. RACK FOCUS TO FIND JASON  RIGHT BEHIND HIM, having followed Miles up the stairs.
96) 1) text: Only darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles  materializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack.  He passes us and we SWING AROUND, now looking at the back of his head. He takes three more steps and JASON STEPS  INTO THE FOREGROUND. Miles senses his presence and JERKS 
102) 11) text: as Rennie moves away, tears rolling down her face,  utterly confused. She backs against the wall next to her  porthole window and THE REAL JASON'S FIST SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW, GRABBING HER THROAT. Rennie struggles,  gasping for air as he attempts to strangle her.
102) 15) dialog: as Rennie JABS THE PEN BACKWARDS, SENDING THE SHARP  INSTRUMENT THROUGH THE EYEHOLE OF HIS MASK. Jason  instantly releases her, reeling backwards.
112) 0) text: TIGHT on the bridge telephone, ringing repeatedly. RISE  TO FIND JASON, ignoring the phone, scrutinizing the deck  below through rain-streaked windows.
121) 0) text: as rain begins to wash the blood from his back. JASON'S  FOOT TRUDGES INTO FRAME...then his HAND REACHES DOWN,  RETRIEVING HIS AXE FROM THE DECK HAND'S SPINE.
124) 0) text: just as a huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING cracks over the smoke  stack and upper deck. JASON steps out from behind it,  gaping down on them with frightening omnipresence.  Gripping the bloody axe.
125) 1) dialog: rapidly moving down the staircase towards them. Sean's  view is CUT OFF as the lifeboat sinks below deck level.
126) 1) dialog: as he relentlessly moves to the hoist cable, raising his  axe.
128) 0) text: ...and the hoist cable falls limply over them. Jason's  too late. Sean looks up and sees:
128) 1) dialog: standing by the hoist, hovering over the edge. Very  angry.
138) 7) dialog: looks at it long and hard. He tears off his life  preserver wits renewed ambition.
140) 2) text: --looking back at the steam vent. JASON APPEARS IN THE  BILLOWING MIST.
140) 11) text: Jason is standing right behind him, shoving something  into his back, out of frame. He thrusts it again,  bringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid.  Jason goes for number three and: 
140) 12) text: Jason's syringe gets shoved completely through him, the  needle sticking out his front side.
141) 7) dialog: He's just as quick, but smoother and more methodical.
141) 10) dialog: ...but Jason is-far from human, easily negotiating the  wrought-iron stairs and rapidly catching up.
142) 0) text: as Julius' head appears, clawing his way onto the tar- papered surface, running to the opposite side. A second  later, JASON HOPS UP RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
142) 1) text: as Julius soon learns the awful truth that the only way  up is the only way down...with the exception of a head- splitting freefall. No way is he gonna jump. Julius turns back to Jason, raising his fists, psyching himself up for the fight of his life. He whispers to himself:
143) 5) text: Then Jason came. He's here, Sean. Oh Jesus. He never expected this.
146) 2) dialog: appears at the parking lot stairs, STALKING STRAIGHT  TOWARDS THE CAR.
157) 8) dialog: as the walking corpse lifts a screaming McCulloch over  his head, carrying him over to one of the scum-filled OIL DRUMS, SHOVING HIM HEAD-FIRST INTO IT. Jason grips  McCulloch's thrashing legs as bubbles rise to the surface of the slime, a pathetic gurgling reverberating out the  drum. At last McCulloch's appendages go limp. Jason  releases him, moving on.
159) 0) text: as Rennie, Sean and the dog run straight towards us,  Jason swiftly catching up. FAST TRACK WITH THEM over to a deserted, rain-slicked SUBWAY ENTRANCE.
160) 0) text: as they bang through the glass doors, sailing past us.  Three beats later, JASON APPEARS, not bothering to open  the door, STAMPEDING RIGHT THROUGH THE GLASS.
161) 0) text: Sean, Rennie and Toby sail down the escalators past a few scattered COMMUTERS. Again, Jason appears, looming tall  at the top. He starts down the "up" escalator.
162) 4) dialog: heaves the dog in front of the train.
163) 0) text: as the doors whoosh shut...but Jason PRIES THEM OPEN. The TRAIN ENGINEER glances back from his booth, seeing Jason  making the improper entry.
165) 0) text: as Rennie and Sean run for their lives, arriving at the  end of a car, jamming the separating doors open and  entering the next car. Jason follows right behind.
169) 0) text: as Sean and Rennie come through another set of separating doors, rushing through... finding they're in the last  car. They look back, seeing Jason enter at the opposite  end. The monster stalks forward. Sean's eyes dart  around. He spots the EMERGENCY STOP CORD. HE LEAPS FOR  IT.
171) 0) text: The sudden stop throws Jason on his back. Sean throws the rear door open, jumping out with Rennie.
173) 1) dialog: fires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle.  Rennie screams as Sean is dragged down...but he manages  to latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle.  Jason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as  Rennie watches helplessly.
174) 5) dialog: shoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians;  they've certainly seen weirder characters than him here.  He moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some rap from their ghetto blaster. His foot obliterates  their stereo system with one stride. They instantly pull  out switchblades and chains.
175) 8) text: Welcome to New York. There's no time for further response as JASON CRASHES 
175) 10) text: as the BURLY CHEF comes out to confront him. Jason FLINGS HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE JUKEBOX.
175) 14) dialog: lifts the very large man and EFFORTLESSLY HEAVES HIM INTO THE MIRROR OVER THE COUNTER.
177) 0) text: They run about ten yards before realizing the alley is a  dead end. Sean and Rennie start to head back the other  way when JASON MOWS OUT FROM THE DINER DOOR. Their vision scatters everywhere in search of a retreat...
178) 1) text: as the dim streetlight glowing in the above world is  eclipsed by JASON, making his way down after them.
180) 0) text: ...no less threatening than the one they just left. When  they pass a lightless intersecting corridor, JASON EJECTS
180) 12) dialog: has been sufficiently taunted. He moves after her.
183) 6) text: as Rennie skirts past the blinded creature: WHIP PAN WITH HER as she turns down Tunnel #2, heading back toward  Sean. CONTINUE TO QUICKLY PAN AROUND until we've come  around 360 degrees and are back on JASON, in no way  ready to give up. He staggers after Rennie.
184) 6) dialog: vision or no vision, he is lurching towards her  relentlessly. She is literally sandwiched between hell  and high water.
184) 12) dialog: within ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder like he's working on some kind of radar.
185) 1) dialog: has just started to climb the ladder when the wind and  smell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him. His  decomposed head swivels to face:
186) 1) text: He doesn't need vision to confirm what his other senses  already know. Jason's mouth begins to quaver...AND THE 
186) 4) dialog: Mmmmmmmmmommy...DON'T LET ME DROWN,  MOMMY... Camera speeds toward his gaping mouth and DOWN HIS THROAT as lightning arcs off his mucous covered insides. We  sink deeper into his guts, fire and smoke flaring into  our eves, eventually coming to a WELL IN THE PIT OF HIS  STOMACH, FILLED WITH BLOOD...and EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON IS  DROWNING IN IT.
187) 0) text: The wall of deadly toxic liquid ENGULFS JASON.
