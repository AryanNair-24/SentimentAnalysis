She's obviously Miss Popular. Tamara crosses to a cute Japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige Honda,  EVA WATANABE.
22) 21) dialog: Are you ready for drugs, sex and rock  'n roll or what, girl? Eva gives her a warning glance, nodding to her left.  Eva's MOTHER appears by the passenger door, forcing a  smile at Tamara.
22) 23) dialog: Hi, Mrs. Watanabe. Just kidding.
22) 28) dialog: I hear the crew members are cute guys  in their twenties.
22) 30) dialog: I'm sure we'll have no problem getting  them to party with us...especially  with this. Tamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with  fine white powder. Eva looks very nervous.
22) 31) dialog: It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It  cost over a thousand bucks but it's  the best.
22) 33) dialog: More or less. It's part of my college  fund.

23) 5) dialog: You can't do that...
23) 7) text: Congratulations on the 3.9 average,  Miss Watanabe. You're in stateroom two- fifty-five. Eva smiles awkwardly, reaching for her luggage, stalling  to see what happens with Tamara.
23) 8) dialog: Look, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car  accident yesterday and missed our  appointment. It's okay, no big deal,  just a bruised arm... (squeezes her arm)
23) 12) dialog: Perfectly. She grabs her purse back from Eva, quickly moving on  before he changes his mind. Their voices become whispers.
23) 13) dialog: A major prick.
23) 15) dialog: Improvise, of course.
40) 0) text: as Toby runs straight toward us. PAN with him as he  rushes around a corner, leading us into a view of TAMARA  and EVA, disappearing down a staircase.
41) 3) dialog: Is that a muscular bod or what? Tamara puts on a sexy smile. The other boxer sees her  instead, instantly distracted. Julius lays him out with a left-right-left combination. The onlookers applaud.  Julius pulls out his mouthpiece, giving Tamara a wicked  smile.
41) 4) dialog: He's undefeated, you know that? (beat)
41) 8) dialog: My stepmom couldn't care less, but  Daddy would have a shit fit. (lets it slip out)
41) 9) text: He might even pay some attention to  me. Tamara quickly puts up her veneer again, spotting  something.
41) 10) dialog: Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock. Look  sensual. Both girls slip into instant sultry as a CREW MEMBER in  his mid-twenties passes them, wearing a tool belt. Very  masculine. He gives the girls a pleasant smile. Tamara  turns around to check out his back side.
41) 11) dialog: I think it's time for some  recreational activity, girl.
41) 13) dialog: You're joking, right? She wasn't, but Eva tries to act like she was. Tamara  walks on, Eva following.
43) 0) text: as Tamara drags Eva into a secluded service area, pulling out her mirror, straw and baggie.
43) 1) dialog: The night time is the right time.  Tamara hands the straw to Eva.
43) 4) dialog: What? Don't be a lightweight...this is  top dollar toot.
43) 7) dialog: You're talking to the prom queen,  Eva. Do you really think I'm going to  risk getting caught?
43) 10) dialog: Do you realize how many people would  kill to be sitting here right now?  Come on, it's grad night. You've got  your whole life to be uptight. Eva takes the straw.
43) 13) dialog: Is that unbelievable or what? Tamara giggles, getting ready to tap out another line.  But the snickering stops upon the sound of APPROACHING  FOOTSTEPS. They both look up, every muscle tensing with  fear as:
43) 15) dialog: Jesus, you scared the hell out of us.
43) 17) dialog: No, we haven't. (awkwardly)
43) 20) dialog: A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll  narc on us...
43) 22) dialog: Nobody related to McCulloch can be  nice. Tamara puts the straw to her nose.
44) 0) text: as Tamara finishes off her line, wiping her nose with a  sniffle.
44) 1) dialog: Oh yeah. Ready to party and then some. She rolls up her baggie, stuffing it into her purse.
44) 5) dialog: Nothing. He eyes the broken mirror. He wasn't born yesterday.
44) 9) dialog: They're out of town.
44) 12) dialog: Relax, I've got McCulloch covered...  but that little narcing bitch niece of  his is a different matter. (calculating)
46) 11) dialog: Wow, sorry...
46) 15) dialog: It was an accident, I swear... Eva avoids eye contact, feeling awful. Sean comes walking up, seeing Rennie.
46) 22) dialog: That was truly excellent.
46) 25) dialog: Time to check out the waiters.
46) 27) dialog: But...wait a minute! Eva walks away. Tamara acts angry, but deep down she's  hurt.
46) 28) dialog: Some friend you are.
48) 1) dialog: The door's open. McCulloch swings it open.
48) 3) text: as Tamara fills a pair of champagne glasses with a bottle of Dom Perignon. She's wearing a full body robe.
48) 4) dialog: Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne  first, Charles? He's about to lose his temper. McCulloch steps closer.
48) 6) dialog: I packed it. Just for us.
49) 0) text: as we approach Tamara's porthole window, peering through  it. We can't hear the words but we can clearly see the  people.
50) 2) dialog: But I haven't even shown you my  biology project... Tamara unties her robe. PAN DOWN to the floor with it as  it softly piles at her bare feet.
50) 5) dialog: Take a closer look, Charles. I want to  make sure I labeled all my organs  correctly.
51) 0) text: as we approach her door, still cracked open from  McCulloch's entrance. We get there just in time to see  Tamara slip her arms around McCulloch, planting her lips  on his, pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly  starched shirt.
52) 3) dialog: I don't think so, Mr. McCulloch. (to Wayne)
52) 8) text: You're both going to be very, very  sorry. He storms off. Wayne looks very, very nervous. Tamara  steps over to him, cuddling up.
52) 9) dialog: Relax, Wayne. He won't risk doing a  thing. (beat)
52) 12) dialog: That's sweet, Wayne. Look, I'd love to  chat but I'm really pressed for time. (ushering him to door)
52) 15) dialog: Thanks for the camerawork. And out he goes, the door shut in his face. Wayne stands  outside her room, realizing he's a major chump.
53) 0) text: as Tamara heads for the bathroom, slipping off her robe.  She moves to the shower curtain and we're right behind  her. Her hand reaches up, grabbing the curtain, yanking  it back... Nothing is there.
55) 0) text: as water from the shower head SPLASHES CAMERA for a beat  before Tamara turns it off.
55) 1) text: as Tamara reaches for her robe, slipping it on. Her body  paint has been washed off.  She steps from the shower, glancing in her vanity mirror  AND SEEING THE REAL JASON REFLECTED IN IT. Tamara spins  around, looking face to face with JASON IN HER BATHROOM.  Just as she SCREAMS:
57) 0) text: The real Jason SHATTERS TAMARA'S VANITY MIRROR WITH HIS  FIST. He grabs a sharp chunk of it, advancing on a  whimpering Tamara.
57) 1) dialog: Please...please don't... Jason raises the shard above her and just as she  SHRIEKS...
74) 9) text: Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude  to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise  up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
78) 1) text: Eva steps into the hallway outside Tamara's stateroom.  She walks up to Tamara's door, knocking on it. It swings  open, unlocked.
78) 3) text: I just want to talk with you. She steps into Tamara's room and we go in with her. The  quarters are empty. Eva stands there for a beat, confused and scared. She's about to leave when a CREAKING SOUND  causes her to look back at:
