And then KABLAAM! the back of Shariff's skull flies off and MOUSE is in the side door, blasting.     BLAAM! Albright breaks for the window. BLAAM! The slug spins him halfway around but he hurls himself through the window backwards. Easy scurries to the front of the house and BLAAM! The bullet goes wide and Albright manages to get into his car and returns fire. BLAAM! BLAAM!... Easy hits the deck. Albright's engine roars to life and he SQUEALS out on the gravel.
