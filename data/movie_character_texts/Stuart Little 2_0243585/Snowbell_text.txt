11) 22) dialog: Let me explain something to you. I am trying -- desperately -- to cling to the last shreds of dignity I possess. I'm licking up after that little monster... (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
11) 25) dialog: «+. I've had my claws trimmed so I won't scratch 'Mommy's Little Precious'... and now a mouse -- because he's lonely and desperate for companionship asks -- as a last resort -- to become his ‘playmate.’ The gall. The temerity... Yeah, okay.

20) 5) dialog: And yet we continue to lick ourselves. Unbelievable. Stuart returns.
20) 7) dialog: Staying?! Are you out of your mind? Stuart, you can't just drag stray birds in here. What do you think this is, a halfway house? It's not sanitary. I mean, look at her, she's filthy -- no offense. She could have germs. And how do you know she's not a vagrant or a thief? Am I being too vague? Get rid of her! Mrs. Little's voice can be heard coming from the doorway.
20) 16) dialog: (pleased) Never mind. You're in for it now. Mrs. Little hates when animals walk in here off the street. She chases my friends out with a broom. When she sees this, she's going to throw a fit.

48) 3) dialog: (cajoling) Oh, why not? Giving up is fun. And look at all the time you save. I'm telling you, Stuart, if more people gave up there'd be fewer wars. A pair of squirrels rush by.

50) 5) dialog: An alley? I'ma cat! We're fastidious creatures. We use a litter box. We don't just yell ‘Bombs away’ and go wherever we are! Look, face it, we're never going to find her.
51) 6) dialog: Hi, Monte. Monte sees Snowbell.
51) 10) dialog: No, you can't eat him.
51) 12) dialog: No. Now pay attention. What do you know about a bird called Falcon?
51) 21) dialog: (nervously) Yeah. In fact, good news. I no longer need a litter box.
51) 23) dialog: Stu, listen. This whole thing has been a groove and a gas, but it's important to know when the fun's over. You don't want to be that last pathetic person who leaves a party.

74) 10) dialog: I'm gonna be Falcon poop!! He runs and jumps into a paint can. Falcon appears. He sees the broken cage and sees Margalo.
74) 14) dialog: (muffled) Can't... stuck... too fat. The can teeters on the edge of the roof and stops. Then Falcon picks up a seed and spits it at the can. The can goes over the side. (CONTINUED)

Well I've had enough! I'm packing up my tinkle ball and my poo-poo box, and I am out of here, Johnny! Hasta banana! You will never see me here again!
92) 27) dialog: I love these people. FADE OUT.
