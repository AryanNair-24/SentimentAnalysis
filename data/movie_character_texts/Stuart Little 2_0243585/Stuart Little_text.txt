15) 11) dialog: Uh... Nothing. Stuart slides down his desk and gets into a tiny red car parked alongside it. He puts his knapsack in the back seat and takes off following a red line painted alongside the lockers just for him. He HONKS whenever someone gets in his way. Suddenly George runs over to him.
15) 13) dialog: Can I come?
15) 17) dialog: Oh... that's okay. I'm busy anyway.
16) 0) text: Stuart is driving quietly down the sidewalk. He's gone abaut a block when suddenly he hears a loud SQUAWK and then sees what appears to be a wounded BIRD fall out of the sky and land in the passenger seat of his car.
16) 1) dialog: Oh, my -- ! Startled, her swerves the CAR all over the sidewalk until SCREECHING to a stop. He stares at the bird, lying in his car. Although, we don't know it yet, her name is MARGALO. Stuart stares at her with a mixture of concern and fascination. She is definitely a unique creature, not much bigger than Stuart. She is wearing a pilot's leather helmet, and goggles and looks like what Amelia Earhart might have looked like if she was a bird. Cautiously he reaches out to touch her.
16) 2) dialog: Miss?... Miss?... Are you alive? She doesn't answer. Stuart listens for her heartbeat.
16) 3) dialog: She's alive! Slamming on the gas pedal, Stuart RACES quickly down the sidewalk.

16) 12) dialog: It's all right. You're going to be okay.
16) 14) dialog: Falcon? What Falcon? At that instant, a huge terrifying BIRD swoops down from the sky. All Stuart can make out is a sharp beak and terrifying pointed talons rushing at him. Margalo yells to Stuart.
16) 17) dialog: Oh, my!!! Stuart GUNS the CAR and goes shooting down the sidewalk. Margalo turns defiantly in the back seat and waves her fist at the bird.
16) 19) dialog: (nervously) Do we really want to antagonize him? (CONTINUED)
16) 23) dialog: See, you're just reducing yourself to his level. Stuart drives faster. People scatter in all directions. A metal grate begins to open like a drawbridge on the sidewalk in front of him. Stuart can't get around it.
16) 24) dialog: Uh-oh, we've got a problem.
16) 28) dialog: Yeah!!!!

21) 3) dialog: I found her.
21) 8) dialog: Mom, can she crash here?
22) 1) dialog: What do you think? REVEAL Margalo gazing at her new "home" as Stuart waits expectantly for her reaction. Mr. and Mrs. Little watch from a discreet distance. Margalo turns away.
22) 2) dialog: What? What don't you like? Margalo sniffles and wipes her eyes with her good wing.
23) 3) dialog: feeding Margalo with a little spoon. (CONTINUED)

27) 0) text: Mr. and Mrs. Little and George are at the table. Mr. Little nudges Mrs. Little and they glance down. On the floor, near the big table is a little table set fo two. Stuart gallantly holds out a chair for Margalo who sits down. Stuart serves her a tiny hamburger on a bun, then picks up a handful of peas from a small serving bowl He juggles the peas. He then gets them to roll down his arm into her plate. He smiles proudly. Just then, a pea lands on his head, squishing. He winces. Margalo bursts out laughing. Stuart wipes the pea off his head and smiles.
29) 0) text: Stuart and Margalo are in the front seat of Stuart's car. They're sharing popcorn and are apparently at a drive-in movie, because we can hear DIALOGUE from an old romantic MOVIE.
29) 1) dialog: Are you cold?
29) 3) dialog: I guess when the weather gets too cold you'll just... fly south?
29) 5) dialog: (surprised) Then how come you haven't done it?
29) 9) dialog: Yeah, something's always stopping me too. Everybody around here -- Mom, George, the kids on the soccer team -- they all think I'm too small to accomplish anything.
29) 11) dialog: Yeah... Boy, I'm really glad you fell in my car. I mean I'm not glad you fell, I just mean -- have some more popcorn.
29) 15) dialog: (modestly) Oh, it was no big deal. You know, on my way home from school, I drive right past the place where you crashed down into my car so I just got down on the ground and I crawled around for a while and bingo there it was -- in a crack on the sidewalk. Then all I had to do was take it home, work on it in the basement in my dad's workshop and one, two, three, good as new.
34) 13) dialog: I can do it. Let me go, Dad.
34) 15) dialog: Down the drain. If it's there, I can bring it back up. It's an adventure.
34) 20) dialog: But... it's Mom's ring. Come on, Dad, let me try. Mr. Little thinks about it. He's torn.
35) 0) text: Mr. Little removing a small pocket flashlight from his ke chain. He hands it to Stuart who is dressed in his yellow rain suit and hat. He is ready for the descent. He climbs onto a fishing hook attached to a string, waves bravely, and is lowered into the chain.
35) 2) dialog: Will do.
35) 4) dialog: Wet. Looking up from STUART'S POV, we can see glimpses of his father's eyes looking down at him and occasional views of the kitchen ceiling growing further and further away. It is like he is viewing the world from the wrong end of a telescope.
35) 5) dialog: There's a lot of slimy stuff on the walls.
35) 10) dialog: Like the inside of your nose. A look of revulsion flashes across George's face.
35) 13) dialog: No! Just more pipe. And everything we ate for dinner last week. The pipe just seems to go on_and on and -- (falling) ooooon... The string has broken. Mr. Little pulls it. The loose end comes rising out of the drain without Stuart. Mrs. Little returns.
35) 33) dialog: I'm okay. SPITTING noises. Panicking,
35) 35) dialog: I_can't reach it. It's not long enough.
37) 2) dialog: I_got it. Margalo quickly takes to the air, raising the necklace with Stuart holding on to it, and bringing him to safety. He emerges from the drain empty-handed but to the cheers of his entire family. Mrs. Little grabs her little boy and presses him to her cheek. You've never seen so much love.
37) 4) dialog: It wasn't down there, Mom. Then she reaches out to Margalo, lifts her up, and kisses the top of her head.
37) 10) dialog: Margalo, you're the best friend I ever had. Margalo looks down, as if embarrassed by Stuart's declaration. This is all too much for George. He takes one whiff of his brother and takes a step back.
41) 0) text: The ALARM GOES OFF. Stuart wakes up. Margalo's stickpin is on his pillow. He reacts.

44) 7) dialog: I couldn't sleep. I think I know what happened. I think the Falcon got her.
44) 9) dialog: I'm going to find her. And don't try to talk me out of it, because I've made up my mind.
44) 11) dialog: You mean because I'm too small? Listen, George, you're as big as you feel.
44) 13) dialog: No. I need you to stay here and cover for me.
44) 15) dialog: Tell Mom and Dad that I... had to leave early for school.
44) 17) dialog: Well, make something up. You're smart.
44) 19) dialog: No, George, she's family. And she's my friend. And when you're friends with Stuart Little you're friends for life. (CONTINUED)

45) 1) dialog: (whispers) Snow... Snowbell! Snowbell wakes up, frightened.
45) 3) dialog: It's me Stuart.

45) 7) dialog: I'm going out to look for her. I was hoping you'd come with me.
45) 9) dialog: Well, because we're friends... and because I'd do the same for you... and because if you don't and the Littles ask where I've gone, George is going to tell them you ate me. (CONTINUED)

50) 0) text: Stuart and Snowbell are in a seedier part of town. Stuart sees a leaky faucet. He pulls a towel out of his knapsack and washes his hands and face. Then he pulls out some raisins and begins to eat. Snowbell is not happy.
50) 2) dialog: Would you like some raisins?
50) 4) dialog: How about the alley.
50) 6) dialog: If we only knew somebody who really knew the streets. Who knew the disgusting underbelly of life in the Big City.
51) 8) dialog: Monte, we need your help.
51) 14) dialog: Where can we find him?
51) 20) dialog: Snowbell, are you all right?
51) 24) dialog: I told you. We're not giving up.
52) 0) text: The CAMERA TILTS DOWN FROM the towering heights of the building with its silver art deco pinnacle and massive falcon gargoyles projecting out from each corner of its uppermost floor. Stuart and Snowbell are across the street in a cafe, looking up. They are dwarfed by the immensity of the building.
53) 0) text: Stuart and Snowbell are walking around the tables in an outdoor cafe across the street from the building. (CONTINUED)
53) 3) dialog: Snowbell, how can you think of food at a time like this? Stay on track, will you? (suddenly points) Look! Stuart and Snowbell zero in on a cellular phone sticking up out of a woman's purse sitting beside her chair. Stuart rushes to it. He climbs up the side of the purse and tumbles into it, landing alongside a packet of Kleene tissues, a set of keys, a box of Altoids, a pile of loose change, and the phone. He turns it on and dials. Suddenly we hear George on the other end and CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN them.
53) 5) dialog: (whispering) Oh, George, I'm glad you answered.
53) 7) dialog: (raising his voice a bit) George, it's me, Stuart.
53) 9) dialog: So are you. Look, I only have a second. I just want you to know that I found her, I'm going off to get her right now, and with any luck, we'll be home by four o'clock. (CONTINUED)
53) 13) dialog: We're at the Pishkin -- At that instant a WOMAN's hand reaches into the purse and pulls out Stuart along with the phone.
53) 16) dialog: It's all right, calm down. It was a credit card call. She begins screaming at the top of her lungs.
56) 0) text: Stuart and Snowbell are standing outside the Pishkin Building wondering what to do.
56) 2) dialog: I'll think of something. Stuart stands there silently for a moment and then notice a balloon man selling balloons across the street. His eyes widen.
58) 0) text: A helium-filled balloon rising up alongside the Pishkin Building. A Coke can is suspended beneath it like a makeshift gondola. Stuart is standing inside it, slowly dribbling out handfuls of sand to lighten the load. He looks down at Snowbell who is waving at him as Stuart rises higher and higher up the side of the building.
59) 0) text: Stuart rising even higher up the side of the building. The balloon is being buffeted by winds. He is almost at the top. He sees the falcon gargoyles just above him. And then he is there. With perfect timing he steps out of the gondola onto the terrace surrounding the pinnacle of the building. It is strangely empty and unguarded. Clearly not many people arrive this way. Cautiously, Stuart reaches into his knapsack and pulls ou a bow made out of a paper clip and rubber band, and a pin cushion full of arrows. He begins stalking through the large space crouched like a policeman with a gun.
59) 1) dialog: (quietly) Margalo? Margalo? Are you up here? Is anybody here? Stuart sees a large, frightening-looking bird shadow on the wall. He gasps in fear, then turns to face the danger. Only it turns out to be Margalo. (CONTINUED)
59) 4) dialog: Margalo! Are you all right?
59) 6) dialog: That's what I figured. That's why I'm here. I came to rescue you.

60) 19) dialog: travels truly but in his mouth. Then catches Stuart's feet dangling keeps coming at him. I hope I wasn't out of line with that 'birdbrain' remark. Falcon pulls out the pin. Stuart drops to the floor. Falcon towers over him, spreads his wings and screeches a he shows his claws.
60) 26) dialog: Stuart, screaming, is tumbling rapidly. He gets an idea. He pulls off his backpack and empties it. Then clutching it by the backstraps, he holds it over his head. The wind catches it creating a parachute effect which, at least, slows his rate of descent. It fills with air and becomes a parachute. He begins to float down. He lands in a moving garbage truck. Luckily it is a soft landing and he quickly stands up. Unfortunately, as he stands a load of garbage is dumped on him. A big metal can hits him on the head. His eyes crisscross as the world blurs before him and he topples onto a mound of garbage bags and passes out.
61) 0) text: Stuart covered in coffee grinds and not sure where he is. He hears the sound of a BOAT WHISTLE and grabs his throbbing head. Quickly he climbs to the top of a mound of garbage bags and gasps. He is on a garbage barge pulling away from a Manhattan dock and heading out to sea At the far end of the barge, up a high metal wall, he see the barge CAPTAIN and his first mate piloting the boat. He scampers over a ton of rubbish and tries to call up to them.
61) 1) dialog: Help! Help! This is a mistake. I'm not supposed to be here. (CONTINUED)
64) 0) text: Stuart is on the barge. He's using a broken piece of pencil to write on a dirty scrap of paper. A whiskey bottle is alongside.
64) 1) dialog: Dear Mom and Dad, I am writing this letter and placing it in this whiskey bottle, so you will know what's happened to me -- your son, Stuart Little. In a few minutes I will be dumped under a ton of disgusting trash into the East River. (thinks ) No, that might upset them. Dear Mom and Dad. I've run away to join the circus. I will from now on be known as Gazombo the Mouseboy. Say good-bye to George. Give Martha a kiss for me. All my love... Gazombo. He rolls it up and starts to put it in the bottle but drops the bottle. It breaks.
64) 2) dialog: Oh, I am so useless. I thought a Little is always supposed to see the silver lining... that must mean I'm not even a real Little. Behind Stuart something glints. Stuart's ears twitch. He's sensing something. Slowly, he turns. He sees the glint.
64) 3) dialog: A silver lining. He walks towards the pile of garbage from which the glint appeared. He begins tossing aside refuse, until he sees something that amazes him.
64) 4) dialog: I don't believe it! (gets closer) It is! To his absolute astonishment he has found his broken airplane buried in the garbage.
64) 5) dialog: My airplane!!!! (CONTINUED)
64) 8) dialog: The silver lining! This is it! I am a Little! He takes a deep breath and begins scouring the barge for anything he can find. We watch Stuart consulting the flight manual and assembling a pile of strange objects, Band-Aids, Styrofoa cups and packing material, old combs, string, cardboard, Q-Tips, rubber bands, electrical wire, and lots of AAA batteries which he pulls out of old television remotes an broken electronic toys. Dowzer and Snoop fly over to watch Stuart, intrigued by his extraordinary industriousness. He hears:
64) 13) dialog: Oh, brother. The pigeons spot Stuart. (CONTINUED)
64) 17) dialog: I'm Stuart. (grabs plastic fork as weapon) And don't try anything.
64) 19) dialog: Right. The pigeons get a look at the model airplane.

70) 2) dialog: How do you know?
72) 0) text: Stuart, desperately trying to take off.
72) 1) dialog: Anyone care to give me a push? Dowzer and Snoop laugh. The garbage is beginning to slide. Stuart is rapidly scanning the flight manual and beginning to panic. The tilt of the barge actually starts the plane rolling down the runway. (CONTINUED)
72) 4) dialog: Now what? Gasping, he looks back at the manual for guidance. The birds jump out of the way and stare in astonishment as he speeds past them. Faster and faster he goes but does not leave the ground. The end of the barge is rapidly approaching. Stuart grits his teeth. The birds seem nervous too. The plane is just inches away from the end of the runway and poised to do a perfect nose dive into the sea. Snoop covers his eyes with his wings, when suddenly, at the las possible second, the plane rises into the air. The Captain looks up just in time to see Stuart fly off the barge.
73) 0) text: Stuart, is maintaining an even course across the city. Approaching ahead of him he sees the top of the Pishkin Building. He bites his lip.

The ground is spinning rapidly toward him. Terrified, he covers his eyes.
85) 6) dialog: I'm not leaving you! (CONTINUED)
85) 14) dialog: You are to me! She's stunned. Then she smiles. They see Falcon. He sees them.
