The sound of his own breathing  suddenly becomes deafening and his vision begins to disto the textures of the stone wall begin to churn and crawl, the flames from his torch melt into different hues. The  pentagram glows and seems to grow out of the wall... The hallucinatory flash is over as fast as it began. Pant stunned, Andy shakes it off. He wipes his face, checking traces of paint.

The train goes by and its rumble fades Andy squeezes his temples and takes a deep breath. Before finishes exhaling, an UNEARTHLY HOWL echoes through the  tunnels. The howl literally takes his breath away - he's  frozen there, eyes wide, not breathing for a long moment. Quietly, carefully, he makes his way back up the dark, we stairs. He comes to the landing, picks up Serafine's shoe and steps into the INTERSECTING TUNNEL. He squints into the darkness. Without his glasses, ANDY'S POV is a bit blurry. He walks into the tunnel. Another HOWL. Andy swallows har

Andy turns and runs. With a horrible ROAR, the eyes lunge after him and turn t corner. As it gains on Andy, we see the dim outline of th massive wolf-like beast. Andy dives for a SMALL CONDUIT, barely big enough for his body, and wriggles into it. Behind him the yellow eyes ap at the mouth of the conduit - the beast SNARLS but can't in. Andy can see a dim light at the end of the conduit. H crawls along. He emerges into ANOTHER TUNNEL.

THE BEAST co tearing around a corner fifty yards behind him. Andy breaks into a sprint towards the antechamber. He sli on the wet floor and lands in a puddle, drenching himself The beast closes in.

The beast is twenty five yards away and closing fast it's massive silhouette filling the diameter of the tunne Andy whips out his SWISS ARMY KNIFE, opens the screw driv and tries it in the old-fashioned keyhole - it doesn't wo The beast is twenty feet away. Andy tries the can opener no luck. Ten feet. Andy jams the corkscrew into the hole. The beast leaps. The corkscrew turns. The DEADBOLT SLIDES SLAM!! The beast rams the gate, shaking the anteroom. But holds. Flashes of CLAWS and TEETH thrash through the bars but it's still too dark to make the beast out clearly. An runs across the anteroom, grabs the steel sewer grate on ceiling, and hoists himself up. Through the bars, he sees a BUSY BOULEVARD in the Pigalle (the "Times Square" of Paris).

The beast ducks and the spear sinks a couple of inches in the BACK OF IT'S NECK and stops, apparently on bone. It  recoils and ROARS with pain, shaking the spear free. ON THE STREET - The cop raps the bars with his nightstick and peers into the dark anteroom.
