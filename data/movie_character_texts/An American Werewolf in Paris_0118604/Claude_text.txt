5) 14) text: Andy approaches the side room and peers in. A small group young people are listening intently to CLAUDE, whose back to us. He's expounding about something in a solemn tone.
5) 15) dialog: (French, to group) ...How ironic. A man who dedicated  his life to opening the doors of the  mind now lies trapped behind them.  Locked behind a door without a key.
5) 18) text: Claude notices the book in Andy's hand. He speaks fluent  English.
5) 19) dialog: I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing  books right now. There's been a  tragedy.
5) 21) text: Claude is taken by surprise.
5) 22) dialog: My God, I'm sorry. But how did you  find your way down here? Wait, let's  go talk...
5) 24) dialog: It's horrible. Terrence was one of  the most brilliant men I've known.
5) 26) dialog: The cops. It's their backward laws  that force all this underground in  the first place, endangering people  whose only crime is pushing the limits  of perception, exploring new states  of psychic awareness.
5) 31) dialog: You think it's silly. But do you  realize that young man is actually  in a deep sleep?
5) 33) dialog: He's on a new drug called ZBH, or  "Daydream". It allows the user to be  fully alert and mobile while he's  dreaming. He is literally conscious  and unconscious at the same time.
5) 35) text: Claude frowns. He looks grave.
5) 36) dialog: Andy...
5) 38) dialog: Terrence and I came down here to do  serious work. For centuries these  tunnels have been home to subcultures  mainstream society would not tolerate.
5) 39) text: He gestures to the main cavern, where people are far gone into various states... some in a trance, some gyrating lu to the eerily hypnotic music. We intercut with these imag as Claude speaks.
5) 40) dialog: These people carry on traditions  dating back to pagan times - the  ancient quest for expanded  consciousness. At the same time  they're pioneering a chemical  revolution, powerful state-of-the- art compounds... But you know what I  mean.... (he gestures to Andy's  face paint) A year ago who would have dreamed of  topically applied hallucinogens like  TMD? Except Terry of course...
5) 44) dialog: You didn't know? But then why did  you... well, don't worry. It's  relatively mild.
5) 46) text: Claude lowers his voice. He looks grim.
5) 47) dialog: No... We stumbled on something else  down here Andy. Something horrible,  almost unbelievable. But very real.  It's been going on for centuries,  though most people wouldn't believe  it, or wouldn't want to...
5) 56) dialog: (checks his watch) My God! Serafine's right. It's time  to go. We'll talk soon.
5) 58) text: Claude dashes off. Serafine drags Andy into the main cave
14) 6) dialog: Allo?
14) 10) dialog: (French) Serafine? Is that you? What's going  on?
14) 12) dialog: God, well don't let him go! Catch  him!
15) 0) text: Claude's sitting at his desk, phone to his ear. The room stuffed with books.
15) 1) dialog: Serafine? Allo?
31) 18) dialog: Two weeks ago.
31) 19) text: Andy spins around to see Claude standing by the hallway t Terrence's office. Andy reaches for the gun and points it him.
31) 22) text: She puts herself between Claude and the gun barrel. Andy  pushes her out of the way.
31) 24) text: Claude approaches Andy, speaking calmly.
31) 25) dialog: You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted  both Serafine and your uncle to obtain  ADM. And now I'm counting on your  assistance too.
31) 29) dialog: A cure. With ADM we can wipe out  lycanthropy, the curse of the  werewolf, forever.
31) 32) text: Claude's face changes. He's surprised.
31) 33) dialog: Ah, you've done your homework...  Excellent. Get your coat. Leave the  gun with Serafine. She can keep  searching. We don't have much time.
32) 0) text: Sheets of rain crash down over this ancient gothic church Sharing an umbrella, Andy and Claude walk inside.

An OLD WOMAN gives them the evil eye and cross herself as they pass. Claude and Andy go up the stairs an arrive at a balcony under a magnificent wall of ancient  STAINED GLASS. One of the panels catches Andy's eye.
35) 2) text: THE PANEL shows a weird medieval ritual - a man draining  blood from another man's neck into a goblet. ANOTHER PANE features a pentagram. ANOTHER PANEL shows a huge werewolf eating a monk under a frowning sun. All the transcription are in Latin. Claude signals Andy to follow him.
35) 3) dialog: The panels that concern us are over  here. (he directs Andy to a  group of panels) I'll translate the Latin.
35) 5) dialog: "Then Simon did slay the demon spirit,  the same as had made him unclean,"
35) 7) dialog: "and Simon did cut out the heart of  the beast which once dead, regained  the shape of a man"
35) 9) dialog: "Simon ate of the heart of the beast  and his soul was cleansed." (he turns to Andy) These pictures are not just myth,  Andy. The scholars of the day used  them to record facts and enlighten  the public. This is the medieval  version of a newspaper.
35) 17) text: Andy grimaces and turns back to Claude.
35) 18) dialog: (to Amy) I don't believe we've been introduced.
35) 21) text: Claude shakes her hand - SQUISH. Some sort of body fluid  oozes out of Amy's hand. Claude frowns and discreetly wip his hand with a handkerchief. Marcel smiles and extends h hand.
35) 23) text: Claude nods "thank you". Andy's had enough.
35) 25) dialog: It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more.  Mutated antigens concentrated in the  heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee.  There were not many bio-chemists  working in the twelfth century, but  with today's technology it's possible  to synthesize any chemical imaginable.  When I discovered this ancient cure  I knew who to go to.
35) 27) dialog: Yes. I was able to decode the old  texts and give Terrence the  specifications. It took a lot of  trial and error, but finally he got  it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I  call it ADAM. But just before he was  attacked, he hid it...
35) 29) dialog: Yes, that sociopath. He's given  himself over to the evil of  lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a  threat to the terror he holds over  others. To us, it's salvation.
35) 32) dialog: Believe me, I won't go through another  night of that hell. I have my  contingency plan right here.
35) 34) dialog: Sodium cyanide.
35) 37) dialog: That's what Serafine is searching  for. Without much luck, I'm afraid.  If only we could speak with him. But  alas, he's off in another realm,  close to death.
43) 18) dialog: Drop the gun!
43) 19) text: Claude is in the doorway holding a pistol. Serafine sees and turns back to Gaston, smiling.
43) 21) text: Gaston just smiles back at her. Claude steps forwards and cocks his gun against Serafine's head.
43) 22) dialog: I said drop the gun.
43) 23) text: Serafine's expression turns confused, horrified. Andy is  shocked. She drops the gun. Claude picks it up and pocket it, keeping his gun on Serafine, who stares at him, aghas
43) 26) text: Andy and Serafine react with confusion to Gaston's outbur Claude picks up the metal cylinder and unscrews its cap w his free hand. He slides out a vial filled with amber flu and holds it to up to the light. He smiles.
43) 27) dialog: No, it's no cure. It's something  much more interesting.
43) 29) dialog: (with mock alarm) Oh, did I hurt the little girl's  feelings? Well excusez moi... I  confess my desire for ADM is quite  "intense". So I deceived you and our  poor friend Terry - a competent  technician, but let's face it, a bit  naive. "The great cure for  lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have  the vision to grasp the potential of  ADAM, until it was too late. And  even then, he came rushing down to  tell me, as if I would be just as  shocked! Ha.
43) 31) dialog: (off Andy's look,  crunching up tablet  in his mouth) Oh this? Rolaids. I had a midnight  snack that... disagreed with me.
43) 32) text: Serafine's been doing a slow burn. She explodes and lunge at Claude, knocking his gun out of his hand.
43) 34) text: She picks Claude up and hurls him across the room. CRASH! Claude smashes into a rack of wine bottles. Serafine jump after him and dives on top of him pummeling him in a blin rage. Andy looks at her, agog.

43) 38) text: He cocks the gun. Andy lets go of Claude's gun. Gaston pi it up and aims one gun at Andy and the other at Serafine, who's wrestling with Claude. Claude throws her off and sh lands on her butt next to Andy. Andy looks at Serafine.
43) 41) text: Claude gets to his feet, drenched with wine and smarting  from Serafine's punches. He walks over to Serafine and ki her in the face.
43) 42) dialog: Shut up, you foul mouthed little  cunt. I don't have time for your  histrionics.
43) 44) text: Gaston is aiming one of his guns at Claude.
43) 45) dialog: Oh for Christ's sakes Gaston. Can't  you rise above the level of common  thug just this once?
43) 47) dialog: Don't be an idiot. There are certain  procedures one must -
43) 49) text: Claude sighs. He takes the vial from his pocket and walks over to Gaston.
43) 50) dialog: Very well then...
43) 54) dialog: I told you. It's not ready.
43) 55) text: Claude turns to the noise of footsteps and a walkie-talki in the hallway. Four uniformed officers plus Rene and Fra storm into the room, guns drawn.
43) 58) dialog: (French - to LeDuc) Thank God! These hoodlums tried to  rob me!
43) 60) dialog: (French) But surely -
43) 61) text: LeDuc cocks his pistol and aims it at Claude.
43) 63) text: Claude puts his hands up.
43) 64) dialog: (French) What's the charge?
43) 66) text: Claude frowns. Gaston swears. Andy looks at Serafine, sho and confused. She looks back at him, angry and sad.
45) 0) text: Serafine hangs her head sullenly, in a quiet rage. She wo meet Andy's gaze. He looks over at Claude and Gaston. Gas is restless, edgy. He grabs Claude by the collar and shak him.
45) 3) text: Claude breaks Gaston's grip and shoves him back in his se
45) 4) dialog: (calmly) Relax my friend. It's still not ready.
45) 18) dialog: I told him it wasn't ready...
45) 19) text: Claude takes a folded PAPER CUP from his jacket pocket. H blows into the cup to bring it back into shape. He then t a SHARPENED STEEL TUBE from his pocket, plunges it into  Gaston's neck, and fills the cup with the blood that pour forth. Andy and Serafine are horrified. Claude puts the c of blood to his lips and pauses.
45) 20) dialog: Now it's ready.
45) 22) dialog: What is the curse of the werewolf?  I'll tell you. The curse is to possess  such awesome power and yet be  completely unconscious of it. It may  as well belong to someone else. But  it wasn't always that way. A thousand  years ago the Gauls had a drug  powerful enough to unlock the door  to lycanthropic consciousness, to  full control. It came from  moonsbreath. A small white flower  once found in the hills of this  region, until the thick headed crusade  by our famous Saint Severin eradicated  it for all eternity. But now, thanks  to ADAM, the "curse" is over...
45) 26) text: Claude rises to his feet, triumphant. He advances towards Andy and Serafine, backing them up against the rear doors the van. He gently traces the outline of Serafine's face  with his werewolf hand. She bristles at his touch.
45) 27) dialog: All my life I've worked to unlock  the power of the unconscious mind.  Well this is it. This is power!
45) 29) text: Claude cocks his werewolf fist and SLAMS it into the back doors, inches from Andy's head. He leaves a deep dent, an opens the doors just a crack. It's a gesture that seems  calculated to frighten them. It works. Claude holds up his LEFT ARM and transforms it to match h right. It takes some effort and a little pain, but he kee a smile on his face throughout the process.
45) 30) dialog: Don't you see what this means? I've  broken through! I'm in total control!  Not the moon! I can do whatever the  fuck I want!
45) 31) text: SMASH!! Claude drives his left arm into the back doors, m another huge dent, and opening the crack even wider.
45) 34) text: He stops short as Claude turns around, revealing his mons arms. Mortified, the cop reaches for the SHOT GUN under t dash. Claude races up towards the view window. As the gua pokes the muzzle through the window, Claude grabs hold of it. BLAM! The guard's shot hits the side wall. Claude rip the gun from the guard angrily, and smashes it to pieces  against the wall, grinning like the devil himself. Meanwhile ANDY throws himself at the doors, kicking them, trying in vain to break them open. He spots the SHOTGUN B on the floor and grabs it. CLAUDE reaches through the window and grabs the guard by head. He repeatedly smashes the guard's head against the  back wall of the cab.

He rears his head to the moon and smiles IN THE CAB of the paddy wagon, the driver hears an uneart howl. It's hellish. Without looking away from the road, h points his pistol through the hole in the compartment. He adjusts THE MIRROR to see into the rear compartment - The back doors are hanging open. He steals a look over his  shoulder - Other than Gaston's corpse, it's empty... He  breathes a sigh of relief and turns back to the road as - A HUGE WEREWOLF - Claude fully transformed - bursts throu the windshield and rips into him. THE PADDY WAGON is traveling over the Pont Neuf bridge. A GASOLINE TRUCK approaches from the other direction. The  werewolf leaps off of the hood just as the paddy wagon,  swerving all over the road, hits the gasoline truck head KA-BOOM!! Both vehicles explode in a fireball, smash thro the side wall of the bridge, and plunge into THE RIVER.
51) 26) text: Claude's stentorian voice echo's from beyond a curve in t tunnel.
51) 27) dialog: You can't turn back Andy.
51) 28) dialog: in human form, walks towards the glow from Andy's flashli around the bend. His naked body is taut and muscular - it looks thirty years younger than it should. His face is yo too - he looks the picture of a powerful young warrior.
51) 29) dialog: "Man is something to be surpassed! A  rope, stretched over the abyss between  the animal and the Superman". Neitzche  was right, Andy. And now, I have  crossed that abyss. I am no longer  man OR beast, but man AND beast.  ADAM has lived up to its name. I am  the first new man, and my God it is  FUCKING MAGNIFICENT! You're already  half way there Andy. Feel the power  in your veins. With ADAM, you could  harness it. Master it. Let it  transform you into something more  glorious than your wildest dreams!
51) 34) dialog: still walking. The light is getting brighter - he's almos around the bend. He's buzzing with a scary kind of euphor
51) 35) dialog: The choice is yours Andy: deny your  own blood, die an unfulfilled child,  or face the challenge of mind and  body united at last. Which will it  be?
51) 37) dialog: Don't be confused by old beliefs.  This is beyond mere words like good  or evil. You have to feel it!
51) 40) text: BLAM! BLAM! He pumps out two shots. One hits Claude in th upper left part of his CHEST. The other hits his CHEEK, e at the back of his jaw and shatters the cheekbone of A SK on the wall behind him. He screams in pain and dives for  cover into a SMALL INTERSECTING TUNNEL. Andy gets up, pausing for a second to look back at Serafi face. It looks peaceful. The undead are gone. He starts a Claude.
51) 41) dialog: sits leaning against a wall of skulls. The face wound is  bleeding but not mortal.
51) 42) dialog: Stupid boy...
51) 72) dialog: is transforming back into human shape. His face is now mo human than beast. He screams into the vertical passage in growling, not quite human voice.
51) 73) dialog: You have no advantage, Andy! My body  has no limits!
51) 75) dialog: in his human shape, crawls into the vertical service pass and climbs up the rungs. Claude emerges from the shaft into the dark tunnel. Andy' no where in sight. We hear only dripping water.

51) 100) text: The train passes. Andy gets up and shines his flashlight  around the ground. The beasts body lies in chunks, smears and puddles. The parts begin morphing back into Claude's  human forms - A THIGH here, A PIECE OF SPINE there... LEDUC inches his way down the last few feet of the stairw using the rusty pipe for a handhold. He walks up with his flashlight and aims it at the BEAST'S HEAD, which finishe turning back into Claude's head. LeDuc glances at Andy. He takes a small envelope from his pocket and shakes out a single SILVER BULLET. He loads it into his gun and FIRES straight into Claude's lifeless he
