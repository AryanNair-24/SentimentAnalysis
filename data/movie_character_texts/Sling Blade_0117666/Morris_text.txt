43) 1) text: White Christmas tree lights are strung above the patio. K sits to the side in a kitchen chair staring at the ground alongside Vaughan, Frank, and Linda. The "band" is set up the patio. The band consists of MORRIS, a heavyset guy in military uniform on tambourine, TERENCE, a skinny guy in wheelchair on bass, RANDY, a long haired younger guy who' not an Indian on guitar, Doyle on a guitar which he can't play and MONTY "The Johnson " Johnson, a large guy with a Top beard on drums. A tub of beer is in front of them. They're all hooting and hollering and drinking. They've obviously been at it for a while. Doyle steps forward to address the 'crowd.'
47) 1) text: Doyle slouches in his chair drinking whiskey from the bot Terence and Morris are sitting facing Karl and Vaughan wh are on the sofa. Randy and The Johnson are sitting across room in straight-backed chairs drinking beer. They really stocked up at the county line and beer and liquor bottles strewn everywhere. Morris is in the middle of a monologue which has obviously been going on for awhile.

"Leaving his soul parting waters Under the medulla oblongata  of (then dot dot dot again) mankind."
47) 42) text: Silence for a moment as everyone in the room just stares something other than Morris.
47) 46) dialog: The dots are where I say they are. Melody and tune. That's your trade. You're a tunesmith Terence.
47) 75) dialog: (stops at the door) The dots just look good on paper. You don't sing 'em anyway. You're showing your true Aries colors now.
