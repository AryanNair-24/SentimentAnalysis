38) 61) dialog: You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  (pause) It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
38) 65) dialog: (mocking) Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.

Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!

Morris is in the middle of a monologue which has obviously been going on for awhile.
47) 19) dialog: You got that shit right.
47) 39) dialog: See Vaughan, you shouldn't question a genius. Morris is a modern day poet like in the old days.
47) 50) dialog: If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.

47) 80) dialog: I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
47) 84) dialog: You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.
47) 88) dialog: That's funny.  (to Linda) You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
47) 93) dialog: You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.

E cans, bottles, a lampstand. He connects with an encyclopedia to the head. Doyle goes the door. His face has changed from angry to sad, almost pitiful.
47) 118) dialog: Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
47) 122) dialog: Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really.  (to Frank) You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
58) 1) text: As Frank and Karl enter, they see Doyle sitting on a footstool facing Linda who's in a chair. Doyle is holding both her hands and talking very softly to her. He sees th guys and looks up.
58) 3) dialog: Well, I'll be damned, there's the boys. I'm glad y'all came in. I wanted to talk to y'all, too. I was just tellin' Linda here -- Oh hell, I'll just start over, set down you boys.
58) 6) dialog: Well, what it is is, I just, well I took off work early today and your mama was good enough to do the same so we could talk. I guess you'd say I'm really here to apologize, which ain't easy for me to do, about the way I acted the other night. I was just drunk and kinda got a little too worked up and one thing led to another. I care about y'all a lot, I do. I don't mean to be so damned, assholish I guess the word would be. Now Karl, I don't believe I hit you, did I? So no apology needed there I guess, but Frank, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hit your mama. I'm just jealous of her. I don't like her life or the way she runs it. I don't like homosexuals and she buddies with one. I don't like little wimpy ass kids or fuckin' mental retards and she's got one of each livin' with her.  (laughs) I was just kiddin'. But really I guess people need to get along even if they have differences.  (pause) You see, I work construction. I build things. Do you realize how important that is to the world. I have a lot of pressure on me. The upshot is, I'm gonna spend a lot more time over here and we're gonna get along. Like a family should.  (to Linda) I may even surprise you one day and pop the question.  (he gets up) Well, I'm goin' back to work. I just wanted to give y'all some little piece of happiness today.  (kisses Linda) See you tonight honey. Karl. Be a good boy, Frank.
73) 1) text: All the lights are out. We see a shot of Frank in his bed asleep, but tossing and turning. Then a shot of Linda in staring at the ceiling and Doyle beside her snoring. Suddenly, the lights come on and Linda lets out a little and sits up, which wakes up Doyle and he sits up with a start. From their P.O.V. we see Karl standing in the door holding a hammer.
73) 3) dialog: What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
73) 9) dialog: Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.

75) 1) text: Doyle is in his favorite chair as Linda, Frank, and Karl through the front door.

75) 17) dialog: Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
75) 20) text: She leaves and Doyle walks up to Karl and Frank.

75) 23) text: They sit on the couch and Doyle kneels in front of them.
75) 25) dialog: Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
75) 28) text: Doyle slaps him across the face and Karl grabs Doyle's ar Doyle shakes him off.
75) 32) dialog: You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  (to Frank) That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.

84) 14) text: Doyle keeps drinking and watching TV.
84) 16) dialog: Yeah, okay. Well, to get the police you push 911. You'll need to tell 'em to send an ambulance, too. Or a hearse. You fuckin' idiot. You're gonna kill me.  (laughs)
