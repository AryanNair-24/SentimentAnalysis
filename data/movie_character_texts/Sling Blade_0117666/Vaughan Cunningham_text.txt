The man, VAUGHAN CUNNINGHAM, is in his forties, with a neat flattop hair cut, glasses, and a paunch hangi over his belt. They eye Karl suspiciously, as the boys approach.
33) 7) dialog: Let me guess. You want a bunch of candy and a pop.
33) 11) dialog: You're gonna rot your teeth that way. But I bet I know what you would like even better. I put potted meat on special, four cans for a dollar and they're not moving very well. I'd sure let a few cans go for free to the right boy.
33) 17) dialog: Can I help you, sir?
33) 27) text: She shuffles him away and leaves Vaughan staring at Karl.
33) 29) dialog: I don't think I've ever seen you before.
33) 33) dialog: It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
33) 37) dialog: What brings you back?
33) 41) dialog: Why are you here now?
33) 45) dialog: Is that right?  (pause) Are you going to be staying here long?
33) 49) dialog: Do you have family here?
33) 58) dialog: (hushed) He just got out of the state hospital.
33) 64) dialog: Sure, go ahead.
33) 65) text: They walk off down the aisle leaving Vaughan a little puzzled.
33) 67) dialog: Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
33) 71) dialog: He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
33) 75) dialog: What about me?
33) 79) dialog: (wrinkles his brow) Karl is a guy guy?

37) 16) dialog: How long have you been standing here?
37) 20) dialog: Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
37) 24) dialog: I mean tomorrow or the next day.
37) 28) dialog: Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
37) 29) text: They stand therefor a moment. Vaughan doesn't really know exactly what else to do, so he knocks on the door. After moment, Frank answers the door.
38) 1) text: Vaughan ushers Karl in and they stand behind the sofa. Do looks up and grins.
38) 9) dialog: Sure, I guess.
38) 20) dialog: I know Albert. We're friends.
38) 24) dialog: That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
38) 30) dialog: (smiles a little) Yeah, I knew that. You're a card all right.
40) 1) text: Vaughan is carrying a tray of food as Karl follows him to table and they sit and immediately start to eat. After a bites, Vaughan starts to speak in an official manner.
40) 3) dialog: Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  (pauses for a response, instead Karl eats french fries and stares at the table) I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  (pause) You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  (watts) Does that surprise you?  (watts) That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
40) 7) dialog: Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
40) 11) dialog: Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
40) 15) dialog: Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way. (pause) There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
40) 19) dialog: That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
40) 24) dialog: Oh. How about before that?

52) 49) dialog: Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
52) 54) dialog: Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
