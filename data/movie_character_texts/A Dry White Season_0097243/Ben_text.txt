The stu- dents, in their smart school uniforms, are cheering enthusiastically a relay race on the immaculately-kept sports ground. GORDON NGUBENE, a 47-years-old African laborer is work- ing in the school garden. A few feet away is his 15- years-old son JONATHAN leaning against a wall watching the games. BEN DU TOIT, a 50-year-old Afrikaaner history teacher, is enthusiastically cheering his son JOHAN, a 15-years-old, who is leading neck-and-neck with another boy in the last leg of the race. The excitement increases as they approach the tape. Ben is beside himself, egging his son with shouts. The young teacher, VIVIERS, standing next to Ben, is shouting "come on Johan," and slapping the father on the back. Johan breasts the tape just ahead of the other boy. The ground is invaded by boys running to congratulate Johan. Ben hurries towards his happy but exhausted son; the prou father pushing his way through the animated boys. As he reaches Johan he pats him on the back.

Let those who rule this land of ours listen to the word of God; let them listen to our peaceful and just demands; let them be humble and go down on their knees and seek forgiveness, then listen to God.

96) 2) dialog: Did you read the papers, Dominee? Were you happy with what came to light? And is it the Magistrate's work to pretend that the facts which came to light didn't exist?
96) 9) dialog: I know, Gordon. What they said about him, that he was plotting against the government -- is a downright lie. He was only doing what I would have done as a father; searching for his son.
96) 16) dialog: Have you no faith in your fellow men, Dominee? Don't you love your neighbor?
96) 19) dialog: What's the use of reaching a court when a handful of people have all the power to decide what is going to be said in that court and by whom?
