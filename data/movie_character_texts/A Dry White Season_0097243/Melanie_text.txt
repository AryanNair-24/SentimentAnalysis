87) 25) dialog: We have a mutual friend.    One Stanley.
87) 28) dialog: Stanley? No. Just careful. A big black rough uncut diamond. Don't be fooled by his happy-go- lucky attitude. There's much more to him.

87) 37) dialog: (interrupts)
87) 40) dialog: Please, Mr. Du Toit, and you'll meet my darling father. She smiles again.    A disarming smile.

89) 23) dialog: (lighting a cigarette)
89) 29) dialog: Exactly. And you cannot fight for justice unless you know injustice very well. You've got to know your enemy first.

100) 6) dialog: I'm a journalist, perhaps tarred with the same brush.
100) 8) dialog: So what happened? I can imagine. The family, the dominee, colleagues, neighbors...
100) 10) dialog: Thanks for the compliment. But remember, you're an Afrikaner, you're one of them. In their eyes they regard you as the worst kind of traitor.
100) 12) dialog: My mother was a foreigner, I'm not pure, wragte Afrikaner. They don't expect the same loyalty from me that they demand from you.

117) 7) text: And this little girl grew up to be a tough journalist. Why a journalist? MELANIE
117) 12) dialog: Alright. I'll tell you. I was brought up in a sheltered way, not that Dad was possessive, not openly anyway. I think he'd just seen enough of the mess the world was in, to want to protect me as much as he could. Then, I went to university. I don't know what you'll think... being a teacher. Pause.
117) 14) dialog: Then I married my ex-teacher.
117) 16) dialog: Fifteen years difference. He too protected me like Dad. Then one day I visited Dorothy in Alexandra and saw her home and the appalling conditions in that township. I was shocked, Ben, and ashamed.
117) 18) dialog: That made me think that I was a parasite, something white and maggot-like... just a thing... a sweet and ineffectual thing. I felt more and more claustrophobic. Poor Brian, who loved and pampered me. Had no idea what was happening. I left him for a whole year and we divorced.
117) 23) dialog: I thought it would force me, or help me, to expose myself. To force me to see and to take notice of what was happening around me.
117) 26) dialog: I wish I could give you a straight answer. What did help me was my wanderings in Africa.

132) 4) dialog: They don't know what you've got and you're a danger to them. I know there's a point of no return, but with our system, one has to plot the route with care.

132) 9) dialog: We better win before the blacks have won. Ben and Melanie laugh.
