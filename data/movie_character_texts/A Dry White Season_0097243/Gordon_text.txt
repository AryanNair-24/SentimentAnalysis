The stu- dents, in their smart school uniforms, are cheering enthusiastically a relay race on the immaculately-kept sports ground. GORDON NGUBENE, a 47-years-old African laborer is work- ing in the school garden. A few feet away is his 15- years-old son JONATHAN leaning against a wall watching the games. BEN DU TOIT, a 50-year-old Afrikaaner history teacher, is enthusiastically cheering his son JOHAN, a 15-years-old, who is leading neck-and-neck with another boy in the last leg of the race. The excitement increases as they approach the tape. Ben is beside himself, egging his son with shouts. The young teacher, VIVIERS, standing next to Ben, is shouting "come on Johan," and slapping the father on the back. Johan breasts the tape just ahead of the other boy. The ground is invaded by boys running to congratulate Johan. Ben hurries towards his happy but exhausted son; the prou father pushing his way through the animated boys. As he reaches Johan he pats him on the back.

The headmaster, MRS. CLOETE, aged 65 years, has observed the incident, but takes no action. Jonathan stands panting with rage.       He suddenly stri away towards the gate in a rage.

Stanley and JULIUS their black lawyer -- the two men seem to be very well-known, people shake hands with them, salute them -- Gordon and Emily's sadness is tinged with anger -- they have dignity, defiance, bowed with grief as they are. Stanley's large hand is placed gently on Emily's shoulder as they examine the dead faces before them. They belong to children, some    in torn, dirty clothes, others naked, some mutilated,    others whole and seeming unharmed, as if asleep, until    the small, neat hole in temple or chest and the small    crust of blood is brough to our attention. A woman behind them starts to scream. They look around to see her holding onto a drawer, her legs buckling. Another woman pulls her close to grieve with her. The assistant approaches them and after a soft exchange he writes a name on a tag and ties it onto the body. The woman can't, won't leave her dead child. Her friend has to pull her away.

The game on the next pitch finishes with a pierce of the whistle. The kids run off past Ben and Gordon. Gordon climbs onto the small lawn mower and STARTS the ENGINE.
31) 14) dialog: I don't care what they say. He is my child. God is my witness today: I cannot stop before I know what happened and where he lies. His body belongs to Emily and me. And drives away -- chugging across the field... leaving Ben -- helpless -- behind him -- watching. From his:

Robert stands beside chair, watching, listening. The youngsters are sleeping in opposite directions on the iron bed. Wellington is sitting beside Gordon at the table. There is something wild in his manner. He looks everywhere as if he is scared of being attacked unawares. The black cleaner from John Vorster Sq. stands near the table. Gordon is reading aloud from a handwritten document.
38) 1) dialog: 'On the second day of our detention at John Vorster Square we were taken to one of the top floors. We were ordered to undress and they started to beat us with fists and sjamboks.

38) 6) dialog: '... We were asked questions for the whole day and night by Capt. Stolz and different policemen -- they never stopped.

Stolz wanted to know the names of the students committee and where he can find Toni Mtimkulu -- Everytime they asked question, they beat us. It was bad beating.' Wellington nods again.    Emily closes her eyes to shut o the image.

Ngubene, don't pretend here, get up." Then the next day I heard he had gone to hospital and I never saw him again.' There's a long silence. Gordon closes his eyes and struggles with his grief. Emily sobs, Robert looks on in anger. Then, finally, Gordon offers a pen to Wellington, who is about to sign the foot of the state- ment, when... ... Suddenly there   is the sound of a TRUCK APPROACHING. Wellington rushes   to the front window and peers outside then panics, fear   in his eyes, he runs into a bedroom a jumps through the   window. Everyone in the room is bewildered. The front door bursts open.

Emily goes to the bed and picks the child up and returns to her chair.

Ben has adapted what would have been a maid's room into his study and the adjoining room into a do-it-yourself workshop. The study has photographs of Ben's past as a provincial rugby player, of his family, school staff and TRECHIKOFF reproduction. On a cupboard are trophies of individual sports at university. He works off a plain desk on which is a handsome pipe- rack with several pipes. His indulgence is a comfortable easy chair. Ben's study, containing only the figure of Ben. He's hunched over his desk, looking blankly at the newspaper. His shirt is unbuttoned, his jacket slung across his chair. He draws heavily on his pipe, wreathing his head with smoke in the beam of the single desk light. He sits in his chair: Gordon's voice rises in his thoughts.
39) 1) dialog: That day, Mister Ben, sir, when they whipped Jonathan, you also said we can do nothing. God as my witness today: I must know what happened and where he lies. His body belongs to Emily and me. He mutters -- more a prayer than a curse.

He handcuffs him while Johannes pulls off the trousers and underpants, and manacles his ankles. Johannes fetches a rod.

Inside the casket, brass fittings, white satin, lies Gordon, incongruous, ludicrous in a black Sunday suit. His hands are crossed on his chest like the claws of a bird and his face, barely recognizable, is gray, the left side distorted, blackish purple. There are rough stitches of the postmortem across his skull and a scar on his lips. Stanley speaks in an African language to the undertaker.
