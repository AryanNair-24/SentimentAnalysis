Stanley and JULIUS their black lawyer -- the two men seem to be very well-known, people shake hands with them, salute them -- Gordon and Emily's sadness is tinged with anger -- they have dignity, defiance, bowed with grief as they are. Stanley's large hand is placed gently on Emily's shoulder as they examine the dead faces before them. They belong to children, some    in torn, dirty clothes, others naked, some mutilated,    others whole and seeming unharmed, as if asleep, until    the small, neat hole in temple or chest and the small    crust of blood is brough to our attention. A woman behind them starts to scream. They look around to see her holding onto a drawer, her legs buckling. Another woman pulls her close to grieve with her. The assistant approaches them and after a soft exchange he writes a name on a tag and ties it onto the body. The woman can't, won't leave her dead child. Her friend has to pull her away.

Inside the casket, brass fittings, white satin, lies Gordon, incongruous, ludicrous in a black Sunday suit. His hands are crossed on his chest like the claws of a bird and his face, barely recognizable, is gray, the left side distorted, blackish purple. There are rough stitches of the postmortem across his skull and a scar on his lips. Stanley speaks in an African language to the undertaker.
