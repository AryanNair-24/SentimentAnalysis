The perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley, hops, alfalfa and tobacco.  Two sturdy brothers, NATHAN, 13 and SAMUEL, 12, work one of the fields, rhythmically swinging scythes through the barley. The house, built of native brick, is well-constructed and well-maintained.  There's a barn, a workshop and a forge. It is a home of substance rather than wealth.  On the front porch, MARGARET, 11, pumps a butter churn while her brother, WILLIAM, 6, watches. GABRIEL, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woods with a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over his shoulder.  At his side walks THOMAS, 14, also carrying a musket.

88) 3) dialog: When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
88) 5) dialog: Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause. Marion is silent.
88) 6) dialog: There will be a time and a place for revenge but killing Tarleton at the expense of your duty serves no one but yourself. (beat)

The thick fog turns the torches into diffused, floating balls of light, turning the Dragoons into ghost-like apparitions. CAMERA FOLLOWS ONE OF THE TORCHES, carried by a particularly rough-looking Dragoon who skirts the edge of the underbrush closest to the house.  As the torch moves, its flame sends long shadows and shafts of light into the underbrush... The CAMERA STOPS to reveal, in the brush, TWO FACES, GABRIEL AND CHARLOTTE, dark, motionless, watching the search.  Behind them, MARION'S OTHER CHILDREN, Nathan, Samuel, Margaret, William and Susan... Around them, SEVERAL MORE OF MARION'S MEN, including ABNE BROWN, weapons ready.

Marion's men wait with the children while Abner, Charlott and Gabriel, flanked by Aaron and Abigail, Marion's middle-aged, black servants, seen in the opening sequence talk with several stern-looking, middle-aged, black FREEDMEN. The conversation, which is out of the children's earshot, is testy, with one of the middle-aged freedmen particularly troubled. Marion's stone-faced children look around, appraising their surroundings, registering the poverty of the shanty town. THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE GROWN-UPS ends with a guarded exchange of handshakes.  Gabriel, Charlotte, Abner, Aaron and Abigail rejoin the children and Marion's men.
104) 1) dialog: It's all set. They follow Aaron, down an alley to A SHACK.  Small. Barely standing.  The children stop in their tracks, knowing this is to be their new home. Charlotte sees their hesitation.  She walks up to the little structure, examining it with a critical eye.  She looks on the doorway, seeing a single room, a dirt floor, wax-paper instead of glass in the windows, a rude, chimney-less fire-pit against the back wall.  She smiles.
105) 0) text: The children help Aaron and Abigail make beds out of armloads of hay.  OUTSIDE, Charlotte and Gabriel talk quietly.

Marion, at the head of the rest of the brigade, waits nex to an increasingly frantic, Rollins.  They see Gabriel wave, signaling all clear. MARION, ROLLINS AND THE OTHER MEN RIDE to the house. Rollins is the first to see THE BODIES.  Horrified, he reins back and dismounts, almost falling. His TWO SONS, WIFE, an OLDER MAN and WOMAN, lie dead in the dirt.  Marion's men silently watch Rollins' agony. Weeping and confused, he moves in a mad, staccato manner, as if he were a marionette, whose strings were being jerked by a drunken puppeteer. Marion and Rev. Oliver dismount and move toward him. Rollins sees them coming.  He hardens and strides to his horse, pulling his FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his saddle holster. Rev. Oliver reaches out to embrace Rollins.
