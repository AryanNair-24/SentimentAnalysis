2) 0) text: A farm built between the banks of the river and the deep green of the swamps.  Good, fertile land, hacked out of the wilderness. The perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley, hops, alfalfa and tobacco.  Two sturdy brothers, NATHAN, 13 and SAMUEL, 12, work one of the fields, rhythmically swinging scythes through the barley. The house, built of native brick, is well-constructed and well-maintained.  There's a barn, a workshop and a forge. It is a home of substance rather than wealth.  On the front porch, MARGARET, 11, pumps a butter churn while her brother, WILLIAM, 6, watches. GABRIEL, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woods with a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over his shoulder.  At his side walks THOMAS, 14, also carrying a musket.

A moment later Charlotte steps out onto the balcony and sees: IN THE SQUARE, a pair of drunk Sons of Liberty, pull down one of the smoldering effigies, cut off its head, then start hacking at it's groin with a sword. Appalled, Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and snaps at the children.
25) 0) text: Dark.  Thomas steps up into the attic.  He finds a trunk and opens it.  Lifting out some blankets, he uncovers a trove of Marion's old military gear -- a worn battle coat a box of medals, a military sword, rusted into its scabbard. Thomas puts on the coat, which hangs off his narrow shoulders.  He stands in front of a dusty mirror, appraising himself, then stops as he hears FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs. It's Marion, tired and dirty from his plowing.  Thomas grimaces, expecting him to be angry, but sees him shake his head gently.

One by one the children join him.  Thomas, Nathan and Samuel listen analytically.  Margaret and Susan press close against their father.  William looks curiously at the cloudless sky.

Marion moves to the next of the wounded.  Thomas starts t help but Marion shakes his head.
36) 6) dialog: Father?
38) 28) dialog: Father, do something. Thomas grows increasingly agitated.  He sees that his father is going to do nothing.  He gauges the distance between Gabriel and the cover of the nearby woods. Then suddenly, Thomas SPRINGS.  He RUNS, THROWING HIMSELF into the two Redcoats holding Gabriel, KNOCKING THEM DOWN
38) 29) dialog: Gabriel!  Run! Gabriel is too shocked to take flight.  A few of the Redcoats, including one of the ones knocked down, shake their heads with sad laughter at Thomas' ineffectual gesture.  One of them grabs Thomas by the scruff of the neck and yanks him to his feet. TARLETON sees the commotion.  Without pausing he DRAWS HI PISTOL AND FIRES, HITTING THOMAS IN THE BACK. THOMAS is thrown to his knees by the shot.  Stunned, confused, he looks down and sees the massive exit wound i his chest. MARION, horrified, catches Thomas as he falls, easing him to the ground. MARGARET CRIES OUT.  THE OTHER CHILDREN are stunned to silence. The REDCOATS are frozen in place.  Tarleton's GREEN DRAGOONS are impassive, having seen worse. MARION holds his son, looking at the huge, incomprehensible wound.  He knows that Thomas is already dead, though his body still moves. MARION'S stunned agony turns to fury.  He rises, his eyes trained on Tarleton, then stops as... TARLETON raises a second loaded pistol and a DOZEN GREEN DRAGOONS raise pistols and carbines, aiming them at Mario and his children. MARION FREEZES, torn between his fury and fear for his other children.  He locks his eyes on Tarleton. TARLETON calmly baths in Marion's anger.  Then, with a hard yank of the reins, he jerks his horse's head around and utters a sharp command to Wilkins.

Gabriel leads several men, riding along a dry path that snakes through the swamp.  They cross a narrow land bridg onto a wooded island, joining a dozen-and-a-half men, including Marion who kneels at a campfire. CLOSE SHOT:  Several of Thomas' brightly painted LEAD SOLDIERS MELT in a cast-iron pan.  The little men fall to their knees then lose form, turning into bubbling, molten metal. The new arrivals dismount and greet the others. Gabriel steps up behind Marion and watches as he pours th lead into a bullet mold, closes the lid and dips the mold into a bucket of water which HISSES and STEAMS.

Finding Marion's weapon' belt he opens one of the bullet pouches and finds the paint-flecked MUSKET BALLS MADE FROM THOMAS' LEAD SOLDIERS.  As Gabriel takes one, Marion steps up behind him.
