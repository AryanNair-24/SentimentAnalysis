69) 0) text: Marion sits at Cornwallis' ornate, folding campaign desk, reading Cornwallis' journal, surrounded by Cornwallis' field gear which includes furniture, music boxes, oil paintings and an elaborate folding commode.  The TWO GREA DANES sit nearby, eyeing Marion warily. The men have divided themselves into two groups, one coarse, the other civilized, each clustered around a separate fire. The coarse men, including Dalton, Brother Joseph and RANDOLPH, a grizzled, black-toothed mountain man, drink and laugh loudly, wearing Cornwallis' wigs askew. The civilized men, including Rev. Oliver, Gabriel, Scott, Fielding and Abner, talk quietly. Marion puts down the journal and walks over to the campfire where the rougher men are gathered.  He stands just inside the firelight and speaks loudly, so that all can hear:
104) 0) text: A compound of rude shacks, built of scraps of lumber and rough-hewn logs, stands on the side of the Magpie River. Marion's men wait with the children while Abner, Charlott and Gabriel, flanked by Aaron and Abigail, Marion's middle-aged, black servants, seen in the opening sequence talk with several stern-looking, middle-aged, black FREEDMEN. The conversation, which is out of the children's earshot, is testy, with one of the middle-aged freedmen particularly troubled. Marion's stone-faced children look around, appraising their surroundings, registering the poverty of the shanty town. THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE GROWN-UPS ends with a guarded exchange of handshakes.  Gabriel, Charlotte, Abner, Aaron and Abigail rejoin the children and Marion's men.

117) 0) text: The small farm seen earlier, surrounded by hills, where the two boys, Rollins' sons ran down the hillside to catc a glimpse of the passing Marion and his brigade. The house smolders.  No sign of life.  Gabriel, Abner and a few other men warily ride the perimeter of the cleared area around the house. Marion, at the head of the rest of the brigade, waits nex to an increasingly frantic, Rollins.  They see Gabriel wave, signaling all clear. MARION, ROLLINS AND THE OTHER MEN RIDE to the house. Rollins is the first to see THE BODIES.  Horrified, he reins back and dismounts, almost falling. His TWO SONS, WIFE, an OLDER MAN and WOMAN, lie dead in the dirt.  Marion's men silently watch Rollins' agony. Weeping and confused, he moves in a mad, staccato manner, as if he were a marionette, whose strings were being jerked by a drunken puppeteer. Marion and Rev. Oliver dismount and move toward him. Rollins sees them coming.  He hardens and strides to his horse, pulling his FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his saddle holster. Rev. Oliver reaches out to embrace Rollins.

Some of Marion's men huddle under lean-to's and quickly rigged tents that offer only partial protection from the cold rain. Abner and Scott do their best to keep a wet-wood fire going.  Rev. Oliver tries to cook. Marion and Gabriel ride up and dismount.  Marion joins Rev. Oliver.

Marion cocks his pistol and extracts his tomahawk on the run... The LIGHTS OF THE BATTLE:  The STROBES OF THE MUSKET SHOT illuminate the woods ahead of them... Moving fast, they PASS TWO DEAD BRITISH SENTRIES, without slowing down... THEY BLAST OUT OF THE WOODS into... THE CLEARING, seeing a tableau of TOTAL CHAOS: Half-dressed GREEN DRAGOONS in formation FIRE IN VOLLEYS... Running men.  Scattered MUSKET FIRE. The strobes of the muskets illuminate RUNNING MEN and other men in HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT. WILKINS IS IN COMMAND.  Tarleton is nowhere to be seen. Gabriel and Abner, both slightly wounded, fight a desperate holding action... On the other side of the clearing, a square of Dragoons forms near Wilkins.
153) 0) text: The AMERICAN FORCES are on the move, all heading in the same direction.  Continentals and militiamen fill the road.  Some on horseback, others in wagons, most on foot. Among them, a mixed unit of Continentals and Marion's brigade, at the head of which ride Lee, Dalton, Abner and Rev. Oliver. Behind them, a single horseman rides up.  It's MARION. Without speaking, Marion rides up alongside Lee.  They exchange nods. Marion rides between Dalton on one side and Rev. Oliver o the other.  They pass a sign that reads, "Yorktown.  20 miles."
163) 0) text: Marion and his men wait. A STRANGE SOUND.  Soft, muted.  The men turn their heads, listening, their eyes shifting. They hear the SOUND OF THOUSANDS OF BOOTS ON WET GRASS, advancing... THE CAMERA WATCHES THE FACES OF MARION AND HIS MEN as the listen to an unseen army approaching. ON MARION'S FACE we see him hearing every sound and we se FLASH CUTS of what he knows he's hearing: The BOOTS OF THE UNSEEN SOLDIERS... Shouldered muskets CLICKING against pack buckles... SILENCE at a stop... MORE DRUMS... The men around Marion wait. THEN, THEY SEE IT... A MASSIVE WALL OF RED appears over the rise in front of them... Thousands of Redcoats, in perfect formation, marching in lockstep, straight for them. Marion sees the fear on his men's faces, but none of them move... The BRITISH DRUMS GROW LOUDER AND LOUDER... it's almost enough to drive a man to flight... almost. The CAMERA explores the faces of Marion's men, faces that we know, Rev. Oliver, Scott, Abner, Marion.  All are frightened but all are motionless. Closer and closer, the British line approaches... The American's don't move... Then, the BRITISH LINE STOPS... At a flurry of commands, the Redcoats ready their muskets then aim... Still, Marion and the Americans don't move... DEAD SILENCE... Then, a single, thin voice calls out from the British lines... IN A THUNDEROUS, MASSIVE VOLLEY, three thousand British muskets fire simultaneously... just as the entire line of AMERICAN MILITIAMEN DIVE TO THE GROUND... Many Americans are saved by the move but many, many other are torn apart by the British musketballs... THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE IS INCREDIBLE... it obscures everything.  Each musket spits out a billow of think whit smoke a dozen feet in front of it and three thousand of them just fired.  The massive, opaque white cloud quickly spreads over the entire battlefield. The astonished Redcoats instantly reload... And watch as the Americans rise in DISORDERLY PANIC and FLEE... Some Redcoats laugh... ON A RISE BEHIND THE BATTLEFIELD, CORNWALLIS, watches through his spyglass, trying to get a sense of what's happening before the spreading cloud of musket smoke obscures everything. He barks to his SIGNALMAN...
165) 0) text: A massive ceremony, carefully orchestrated, laid out on the cleaned up battlefield. Thousands of men, everyone in his place, as if well- directed actors in a grand theatrical performance. The French and American armies, fifteen thousand men between them, stand in perfect formation on either side o the field, forming an avenue for the British army which marches out of it's fortification. At the head of the avenue, WASHINGTON AND HIS STAFF stand waiting. A musical band of Continentals, thirty men strong, loudly plays a tune, "The World Turned Upside Down," a jaunty British air with a melancholy undercurrent. CORNWALLIS marches with his officers, eyes straight ahead covering his agony as best he can. As he walks along the avenue he passes the remnants of th South Carolina militia. MARION, standing with Dalton, Rev. Oliver, Abner, Scott and the rest of his surviving men sees Cornwallis pass... CORNWALLIS glances over, noting what unit they are by a tattered battle standard that flies over them.  It's only a glance and he DOESN'T PICK OUT MARION, who is just one man among the many...
