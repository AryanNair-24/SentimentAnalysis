3) 0) text: A perfect colonial workshop, fastidiously arranged with every conceivable tool of the period.  A foot-powered lathe.  A drop-forge.  A lifting saw.  Racks of tools, planes, hammers, augers, drills, blocks, all hanging in their places.  All very well-worn. FRANCIS MARION methodically works his lathe, turning a piece of hardwood, shaving off tiny curls of wood with a razor-sharp chisel.  He's in his late-forties, strong and weathered.  His hands, though big and callused, handle th chisel with a surgeon's precision.  Self-educated and self-sufficient, he has built himself, as he built his farm, brick by brick, from the coarse clay of the earth. A finely-made rocking chair, missing only the dowel on which Marion is working, sits on the work table.  The chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue. Sitting on the woodpile, SUSAN, 4, a silent, stone-face wisp of a child, watches her father. Marion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe, carefull fits it into the chair, inserts a peg and taps it into place.  Then he steps back and appraises his handiwork. He picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale, countering with a three-pound weight.  The chair floats. Marion blows softly on the weight which sinks.  Susan nods, so far, so good.  Marion puts the chair on the floo and walks slowly around it, checking every angle. Then, the acid test.  He takes a deep breath and lowers himself onto the seat, gingerly adding an ounce at a time Not a creak.  He smiles and sits back with a sigh. CRACK!  THE CHAIR SPLINTERS under Marion's weight, DUMPIN HIM on his ass on a pile of broken wood.

The thick fog turns the torches into diffused, floating balls of light, turning the Dragoons into ghost-like apparitions. CAMERA FOLLOWS ONE OF THE TORCHES, carried by a particularly rough-looking Dragoon who skirts the edge of the underbrush closest to the house.  As the torch moves, its flame sends long shadows and shafts of light into the underbrush... The CAMERA STOPS to reveal, in the brush, TWO FACES, GABRIEL AND CHARLOTTE, dark, motionless, watching the search.  Behind them, MARION'S OTHER CHILDREN, Nathan, Samuel, Margaret, William and Susan... Around them, SEVERAL MORE OF MARION'S MEN, including ABNE BROWN, weapons ready.  The moving lights play on their faces. AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE, the torches converge, illuminating Tarleton who gives the unheard order.
