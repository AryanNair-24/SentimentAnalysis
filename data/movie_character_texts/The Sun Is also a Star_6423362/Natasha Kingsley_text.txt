21) 45) dialog: I don’t believe in love.
21) 47) dialog: Oh really? Can you prove it?
21) 49) dialog: Words on paper. Never mind the fact that eating large amounts of chocolate has the same effect on you as falling in love.
21) 52) dialog: People just want to believe. Otherwise they would have to admit that life is just a random series of good and bad things that happen until one day, you die.
21) 54) dialog: I’m okay believing in the things that science can make sense of. If love made sense, more than forty- eight percent of all marriages would make it.

21) 77) dialog: This quiz isn’t going to make me fall in love with you, Red Tie.
21) 79) dialog: Can’t. I have a doctor’s appointment.
22) 2) dialog: I am heading to my appointment on the east side and you are, apparently, tagging along with me.

22) 11) dialog: What does a poet laureate even do?
22) 14) dialog: You’re not joking, are you?
22) 16) dialog: Easy. I'd be a benevolent dictator. Daniel laughs.
22) 18) dialog: Nope. Pure benevolence from me. I would decide what was good for everyone and do it.
22) 20) dialog: Can’t please everyone. As my poet laureate, you could comfort the loser with a good poem.

Zero point nine percent of those left will barely make any money doing it. Only the last zero point one percent make it big. Everybody else just wastes their lives trying to be them.
22) 40) dialog: Ha ha. Look, when you’re a happy doctor making lots of money, you’ll thank him that you didn’t become a starving artist dreaming pointlessly about making it big. Tasha notices the disappointed look on Daniel's face. NATASHA (CONT’D) Wait, you’re not serious about the poetry thing, are you?
23) 1) dialog: So, this is me.
23) 3) dialog: Daniel. You have an interview and I have this... thing. This is where we say goodbye. Daniel falls silent for a beat.

23) 26) dialog: Turns out that BMW that almost hit me had already done its fair share of damage... 40.
24) 1) dialog: My attorney-to-be was crossing the street, and without his own personal Daniel to save him... BOOM. The WHITE BMW cruises through a stoplight and KNOCK JEREMY TO THE GROUND.
24) 2) dialog: A drunk and distraught insurance actuary hit him. Jeremy crawls to the side of the street as other PEDESTRI help him up and call 911.
25) 2) dialog: But that might be too late--
25) 5) dialog: I have no idea what to write. So I give the facts: my family traveled to America on a tourist visa and we have not left the country since. We have committed no crimes, except for my dad’s DUI. 41. Tasha jots this down quickly, then hands the papers back Hannah. Hannah flips through it, then stops on the back p
25) 7) dialog: Like what?
25) 9) dialog: Is that really--
25) 14) dialog: That’s great. Hannah takes the forms from Tasha and reads through them.

25) 20) dialog: Good. I think.
25) 22) dialog: Well, it’s not official yet, but... there may be something other than resigned dread in my future. Bev squeals, then squeezes Tasha tight in a hug.
25) 24) dialog: And say what? A man who I don’t know sent me to see another man I don’t know. Then a paralegal, who is not a lawyer, whom I also don’t know, says everything will be all right. What’s the use in getting all our hopes up?
25) 27) dialog: You cannot. They both laugh.
25) 28) dialog: You know I can only take so much positivity. (beat) But there is something measurable I have to tell you. I met a boy...

As Tasha tells her story, INSERT FLASHBACK SHOTS of Danie enhanced by her memory and favorable shades of lighting: - Beautifully backlit after he saved Tasha’s life. - Getting foam on his nose at the coffee spot. - Lovingly looking at her as he says “goodbye.”
25) 31) dialog: And as I gave Bev the full Daniel rundown, it hit me...
25) 32) dialog: I didn’t even get his full name!
25) 34) dialog: I know! I should’ve gotten his number. Tasha looks down to her phone. It’s 11:35. NATASHA (CONT’D) I mean, what if this immigration nonsense does resolve itself? How will I find him again?
25) 37) dialog: Don’t be ridiculous. He had an interview. He’s not still here. In spite of herself, Tasha starts to look around the lobb too. Hopeful. But she can’t find him. Her shoulders slump
25) 39) dialog: And how is that funny?
25) 41) dialog: (still searching the lobby) Please. It’s not like I think we were meant to be or anything ridiculous like that...just saying, it would've been nice-- Tasha finally sees Daniel. He’s crossing the lobby, makin beeline for her. She covers her excitement.

25) 56) dialog: ‘Tash? We're doing nicknames already?
26) 1) dialog: Did you postpone for me?
26) 3) dialog: What makes you so sure I’m worth it?
26) 5) dialog: Fine. I have to come back at 3:30. Daniel looks at his phone: 11:45 AM.
26) 7) dialog: Looks that way, huh? The two of them exchange flirty smiles. NATASHA (CONT’D) So, what should we do now?
27) 1) dialog: Your father owns a black hair care shop called “Black Hair Care”?
27) 3) dialog: Hmm. I guess when you said ‘store,’ that’s not what I was expecting. How'd they get into that?
28) 9) dialog: Daniel. It’s fine. I get it. All parents are embarrassing. Daniel averts his eyes. Tasha reaches out for the door, b he stops her.
29) 2) dialog: Want to show me around?
29) 8) dialog: Sure. They walk down the hair dye aisle. Tasha stops in front o some boxes with brightly colored dyes, picks up a pink on
29) 10) dialog: Why not?
29) 12) dialog: Shows how much you know.
29) 14) dialog: The whole thing wouldn’t be pink. Maybe just the ends. He reaches for the box and now they’re both holding it an facing each other in an aisle that only has space for one
29) 19) dialog: I'm Natasha. A friend of your brother's.
29) 26) dialog: Wow. You’re an asshole. He smiles as if Tasha’s paid him a compliment. NATASHA (CONT’D) (to Daniel) Do your thing and let’s get out of here. She squeezes his hand. They turn away and run right into father. Tasha pulls her hand away, but it’s too late.
29) 35) dialog: No, thank you, Mr.--
29) 39) dialog: Thank you, Mr.--
29) 41) dialog: Mr. Bae. I don’t need any--
29) 43) dialog: I like it big.
30) 3) dialog: I don’t think that could've gone any worse. Racist dad. Racist and sexist older brother. And the store! I mean the ancient posters of those women and your dad offering me a relaxer.
30) 5) dialog: Come on. Tragedy is funny.
30) 7) dialog: Of course. Isn’t that what life is? We all die at the end.
30) 10) dialog: What are you even saying? It’s not your fault. You can’t apologize for racism.
30) 12) dialog: I get it. It’s hard to come from some place or someone that you’re not proud of... But you’re not your dad. Or your brother thankfully.
30) 14) dialog: Hmm. There’s so many. But I guess if I had to pick one, I’d say the planetarium.

Can you imagine some jerk just leaning on the bell demanding ketchup? The Waitress returns and places the soup and two uncooked eggs on the table. She tosses paper-clad spoons and chopsticks into the center of the table. NATASHA (CONT’D) Oh, can I have a fork, please? The Waitress gives her a disapproving look, then walks of 64.

37) 2) dialog: Just choose a song.
37) 4) dialog: How poetic.
37) 6) dialog: I don’t know, most poems I’ve read are about three things: love, sex, or the stars. You poets are obsessed with stars. Falling stars. Shooting stars. Dying stars.
37) 8) dialog: Sure, but why not more poems about the sun? The sun is also a star and it’s the most important one. That alone should be worth a poem or two.
37) 10) dialog: Domineering? You’ve got it all wrong. The sun is a benevolent star. A giver...it’s also our greatest symbol of hope.
37) 12) dialog: The brightest stars that we see at night are often the light from stars that have already died. (MORE )
37) 14) dialog: It's sad, really. But the sun is different. Everyday it brings energy and life and hope to us. Without it, we’d all be lost. I think that’s something worth writing about.

38) 6) dialog: Nothing’s changed. Daniel catches up to her and Tasha looks away.
38) 8) dialog: What are you talking about?
38) 10) dialog: Oh, you know how I feel? Do you? You don’t know shit Daniel.
38) 12) dialog: This. You and me. This thing. Well this can’t happen. It’s over ok.
38) 14) dialog: Oh, well do you know that I’m not a citizen? Huh? So you know that my family is being deported tomorrow? Huh do you know that? Do you know that all this - whatever it is. It NOT meant to be. Do you know that part? Daniel stares, silent. Totally blindsided.
38) 16) dialog: I didn't lie to you. I just didn’t tell you everything.
38) 18) dialog: I didn't ask you to do that.
38) 20) dialog: It wasn’t your business.
38) 22) dialog: Look, Daniel. I told you not to fall for me, okay? I tried.

43) 2) dialog: So instead of coming with us, he went out drinking with his “fellow actors.” Mr. Kingsley finally downs his last drink and stumbles to the exit.

Fitzgerald looks over one of the forms then gets a yellow legal pad out of his desk drawer, then jots something dow Then he sits in silence for a long beat. His expression v hard to read. Tasha stares at him, nervously.
46) 2) dialog: Each moment of silence is soul crushing. I knew I shouldn’t have listened to Hannah. Shouldn’t have gotten my hopes up... Then finally--
46) 4) dialog: It’s okay. I know I’m out of options. Thank you for your time. Tasha moves to get up. But Fitzgerald waves her back down
46) 6) dialog: What do you mean? Are you saying you can fix this?
46) 9) dialog: But you think you can sort it out?
46) 11) dialog: Thank you. You have no idea how much this means to me. My family.
46) 12) dialog: I should call my parents and tell them, but right now, all I can think about is Daniel.

55) 13) dialog: You'd like him...a scientist anda writer. It was almost romantic how much he loved the universe. (then) People think science is so cold, but it isn’t true. It actually makes you appreciate your life.
55) 15) dialog: Think about it...the universe is 99.99999% empty space. Nothing but rocks and burning stars spread out over a billion galaxies--and yet here we are, the two of us together, looking out at the universe. We won the cosmic lottery just by being born...the time we have on this earth is extraordinary. It’s up to us to make the most of it. Daniel is speechless. Charmed by her words. They lock eye

60) 36) dialog: No. What I was doing was trying to fix your mistakes.
60) 38) dialog: He’s not a stranger. He’s my guest.
60) 40) dialog: Was your house. You weren’t responsible enough of a father to keep it, remember? Or maybe you couldn’t handle the responsibility of being a father at all...
60) 42) dialog: I heard what you told mom after the play--
60) 47) dialog: I heard what you said about me and Peter... That we were your greatest regrets. How could you say that about your own children? The steam comes out of Mr. Kingsley’s engine. He searches futilely for words... NATASHA (CONT’D) I’m sorry that life didn’t give you all the things you wanted.
60) 49) dialog: Maybe you were right. Maybe you weren’t meant to have us. Maybe you really were cheated.
60) 51) dialog: It doesn’t matter if you meant it or not. Hearing you say those words spoiled all the good memories I did have of us. Made me wonder, did you regret my existence when we were watching cricket matches together? Eating mint chocolate chip ice cream after school? What about the day I was born? Tears stream from Natasha’s face. Daniel holds her. She p free from him, continuing. NATASHA (CONT’D) But I decided, you don’t get to regret us. People make mistakes all the time. Small ones, like getting in the wrong checkout line. And big ones like giving up... I saw the play. That night, on stage you were incredible. But in real life, all you’ve done is quit on your family. Leaving the rest of us to pick up where you left off. Mrs. Kingsley’s crying now too. Peter walks into her arms a hug.
60) 53) dialog: You decide who you are, that’s how. That’s why we came here, not for handouts, but to make our own lives. Mr. Kingsley holds his head in his hands. Ashamed.

When we get to Jamaica, you can’t give up. You can be a father. A husband. And an actor all at once. It’s up to you. She hugs him. Mrs. Kingsley and Peter join in.
60) 54) dialog: It wasn't exactly the ending I was hoping for this morning, but at least we were on our way to being a family again. Tasha sniffs, then motions for Daniel. Together as one, t embrace.
61) 2) dialog: (laughs) Yes, I believe so. (beat) I’m so sorry, Bev. It all happened so fast. The cabbie gets inside the car. NATASHA (CONT’D) I have to go. I’1l call you soon as I land. Love you. Tasha hangs up, then gets in the cab.
62) 0) text: Natasha looks out the window, soaking up her Bronx neighborhood one final time. Then she lays her head on Daniel’s shoulder. 99.
62) 1) dialog: Do you think we would've worked out if I stayed?
62) 3) dialog: Yes. Daniel smiles. NATASHA (CONT’D) How hard would it have been for your parents?
62) 5) dialog: I have something to tell you.
62) 7) dialog: You shouldn’t go to Yale and be a doctor if your heart’s not in it. If you want to be a poet and write your heart out, do that. There’s still time.
62) 9) dialog: Practicality is overrated.
62) 11) dialog: I don’t know. Maybe not. You got me thinking. It’d be nice to do something I’m actually passionate about, like study the stars. Daniel turns to her, surprised. 100.
62) 13) dialog: So, how many more questions do we have left? He takes out his phone. He laughs.
62) 15) dialog: We could do that or...we could just make out instead.
62) 18) dialog: My dad.
62) 20) dialog: Because he’s not done yet. What about you?
62) 22) dialog: I’m not your family, though. 101.
62) 24) dialog: You always find the right words. (beat) You’1ll make a great poet. Daniel takes this in. The cab pulls to the curb.
63) 5) dialog: Daniel believes this is fate... that everything aligned for us to be in the right place at just the right time. I don’t know that this is fate. (MORE )
63) 7) dialog: But I do know that a lot of events had to transpire for us to be standing here, right now, in the middle of this vast universe. That’s amazing. They continue to stare, less self-conscious. Their smiles drift away as they catalog each other’s face. Tasha reliv all the moments that led them here:
63) 8) dialog: Because if I hadn't been late to my appointment, I wouldn’t have met Lester Barnes. And if he hadn’t said the word ‘irie,’ I wouldn’t have had a meltdown. And if I hadn’t had my meltdown, I wouldn’t have eventually met Daniel. As she speaks, we see GLIMPSES of the day.
63) 9) dialog: And if I hadn’t met Daniel, I may have never known this feeling that’s taking over me right now. This feeling that can only be-- The phone timer BUZZES, bringing Tasha BACK TO REALITY.
63) 10) dialog: Love. (beat, then) I love you, Daniel Bae.
63) 13) dialog: I don’t know how to say goodbye. Daniel’s eyes mist.

70) 7) dialog: Marry you? You can’t be serious. (off his look) You are.
70) 9) dialog: I do, but--
70) 11) dialog: Daniel... listen. I do really love you. But we have to be smart. We’ve only known each other for a day. A day. You keep saying we're meant to be, but what if we’re not? An ANNOUNCEMENT drowns her out.
70) 13) dialog: Right now, this is real life. The plane waiting on the tarmac to send me and my family back to Jamaica is very real. I tried to stay... (MORE )
70) 15) dialog: I tried everything and I failed, and now that’s it. I have to go. Tasha lets a single tear fall down her face. Daniel wipes off. They stand face-to-face in the security line.
70) 17) dialog: What happens next is up to us. We decide our fate. There’s Facetime, emails, Skype... we'll figure it out. We’re not going to give up, okay? Tasha plants a final kiss on Daniel’s cheek, then rejoins family in the security line. Daniel looks on, distraught. INT. TASHA’S PLANE - DUSK Tasha stares out the window as the sun begins to set. Her mother pats her arm reassuringly.

81) 4) dialog: Just something I like to play when I travel. Do you want to hear it? The girl NODS. Tasha puts the headphones over her ears. Natasha HUMS along to the music. A YOUNG MAN seated in fr of them turns around. He peers back at them, his face obscured by the seat. After a verse and a chorus or so, the Little Girl gives t headphones back to Tasha.
81) 6) dialog: (laughing) It reminds me of someone. The CUTEST SMILE you've ever seen from the Little Girl. 111.
81) 8) dialog: Maybe...
81) 11) dialog: Daniel? Natasha smiles WIDE. Daniel smiles back. NATASHA (CONT’D) Daniel. Their eyes meet as both Tasha and Daniel keep beaming. Neither believing what they’re seeing is real. But it is. Despite the odds, this was meant to be. It was in the sta FADE OUT.
