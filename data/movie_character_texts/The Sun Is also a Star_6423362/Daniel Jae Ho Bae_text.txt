7) 6) dialog: The day that decides my future. Behind him, shelves full of the world’s greatest poets: Shakespeare, Shelly, Frost, Poe, Plath, Angelou, Hughes.
7) 7) dialog: Normally I’d write a two-page poem about something of this magnitude. At least a haiku. But today, my anxiety’s holding me hostage. Daniel grabs his writer’s notebook, throws it into his satchel. Takes one final glance at himself.
7) 8) dialog: Because I need every brain cell focused on nailing this interview. Daniel takes one final glance at himself, then exits.
8) 0) text: Daniel’s mother steams frozen dumplings. Daniel pours a b of Cap’n Crunch. She shakes her head disapprovingly. Min speaks with a heavy Korean accent.
8) 2) dialog: I’m pretty sure I inherited my mother’s anxiety...
9) 1) dialog: Which started the day she uprooted her whole life in Korea to come to America. For most immigrants, moving to a foreign country is an act of faith. What if you can’t adapt? What if you’re not welcomed? What if you lose all sense of your identity and culture?

10) 1) dialog: So when my brother and I were born, she gave us both an American name and a Korean name. So we would know where we were from. And where we were going. The family cheers as Young Daniel nears the stethoscope, grabs the PEN instead to his parents’ dismay.
11) 6) dialog: My brother, Charlie, is an asshole. Charlie grabs the box of Cap’n Crunch, then pours cereal milk into a bowl and sits. He chomps loudly with each bit
11) 7) dialog: He’s been at home the past semester because he failed too many classes at BU. An epic screw up that my parents can’t accept.
11) 12) dialog: Umma, give him a break. Daniel finishes the last of the dumplings. Grabs his plat and hand washes it in the sink. Min Soo looks over her son, eyes honing in on his bun.
11) 15) dialog: They let girls into Yale, too. Min Soo scolds him with her eyes, then hands him a money pouch with deposit slips.
11) 17) dialog: Alright, Umma. I’1l get it cut. (off her skeptical look) I promise. Daniel grabs his bag and heads for the door.

14) 5) dialog: You’re supposed to be making me feel better about going to Yale.
14) 7) dialog: Well, try something else.
14) 9) dialog: Unlike you, I actually care about what my parents think. And anyway, the interview’s today. Too late to back out now. Omar shrugs and leads the way down the subway stairs.
16) 0) text: Daniel and Omar sit in the congested subway car. Daniel l at his reflection in the shiny metal subway door. Turns s can see his ponytail.

17) 1) dialog: How much time you got before work?
17) 3) dialog: It's been a while since we went up. Today’s the perfect day. Daniel starts to make his way through the diverse crowd o people rushing to their trains.
17) 4) dialog: Come on! Omar follows after Daniel, almost losing sight of him in pedestrian traffic. EXT. TASHA’S HIGH SCHOOL - DAY Tasha stands outside the fence of her school. Fighting te

18) 1) dialog: My life’s gonna go one of two ways after today. If I don’t get into Yale, it’ll be Charlie all over again. And if I do...white jackets and picket fences from now until eternity.
18) 3) dialog: Even if I win, I lose. What kind of future is that?
18) 5) dialog: I just wish I could do something about it. Daniel sighs. He turns over and lies face up on the walkw
18) 6) dialog: There's gotta be something more to it all than this. His gaze catches the gigantic mural of the Universe paint on the ceiling of the terminal.
18) 7) dialog: You ever notice that before?
18) 9) dialog: It’s a sign.
18) 11) dialog: Yeah, but have you ever seen it? It's like the conductor said on the train, maybe the universe is trying to tell me something.
18) 13) dialog: I’m serious, Omar. Of all the days we've been here, today is the day that I notice the most amazing thing in all of Grand Central? It’s not a coincidence.
18) 15) dialog: I don’t know yet.
18) 18) dialog: Look at her jacket! Carpé Diem. 21.
18) 20) dialog: Carpé Diem... “Seize the Day.” (off Omar, unfazed) It's gotta be a sign. C’mon on! Daniel drags Omar off in the direction he last saw Natash
19) 0) text: Daniel’s eyes light up as he follows Natasha from a dista
19) 2) dialog: No, it’s not. I’m maintaining a non- creepy, half-block distance. Tasha enters a record store. GALAXY RECORDS. Daniel stops his tracks. Stares at Omar.
19) 3) dialog: (re: the store’s sign) You gotta be shitting me! This is definitely a Sign.
19) 5) dialog: I want to know where this leads.
20) 3) dialog: She’s just going to steal that? Tasha turns to find Daniel standing right behind her.
20) 5) dialog: Shouldn't we say something? Tasha shakes her head.
20) 7) dialog: Sticky Fingers is your friend?
20) 9) dialog: How does that work exactly?
20) 12) dialog: Great pair. (beat, then) We should tell someone. 23.
20) 14) dialog: Are you?
20) 16) dialog: We were having a moment.
20) 18) dialog: Yup.
20) 21) dialog: Why are you and your girlfriend stealing things? 24. Rob holds his hands up and takes a step back.
20) 23) dialog: This is an independent record store. That means it’s family owned. You’re stealing from real people. Do you know how hard it is for small businesses to survive when people like you just take stuff? Tasha spots an EMPLOYEE approach Kelly.
20) 26) dialog: Damn, that was cold. Kelly hands Employee Prince’s “Purple Rain” from under he jacket. The employee snatches the record.
20) 28) dialog: Well, at least she has good taste.
20) 30) dialog: I don’t know if that’s his best one. Solid top three, for sure. 25.
20) 32) dialog: Controversy. My mom used to play that song all the time when I was a kid. Tasha smiles, impressed. Daniel stares at her, googly-eye Grinning.
20) 34) dialog: Daniel. My name is Daniel. He sticks out his hand for a shake. Tasha shakes it. He h it a beat too long. A moment passes between them.
20) 36) dialog: Well, maybe I can walk you--
21) 0) text: Natasha walks out into the crowd and spots Rob and Kelly ahead. Kelly cries as Rob gives his best half-ass explanation. Natasha moves past them unnoticed. Daniel, ear to his phone, eyes Tasha in the distance as h follows her.
21) 2) dialog: Because she wouldn’t give it to me.
21) 4) dialog: But it’s not like she totally blew me off. She was nice. I’m telling you, there was a spark there.
21) 6) dialog: I’m not following her. She just happens to be going my way. Natasha stops at the crosswalk ahead of Daniel.
21) 7) dialog: Oh, shit, I’m getting close. She'd definitely think I was stalking her if she turned around now.
21) 10) dialog: You okay?
21) 12) dialog: I‘1l buy you another pair. She shakes her head “no.”
21) 13) dialog: It’s the least I can do. Tasha finally looks at him.
21) 15) dialog: You wouldn't have died. A little maimed, maybe. Natasha stares back at him, unfazed. Her eyes fill with tears.
21) 17) dialog: Man, I knew you would think that.
21) 19) dialog: Maybe it was meant to be. Natasha exhales deep.
21) 21) dialog: At least tell me your name.
21) 23) dialog: Nice name.
21) 26) dialog: Now you're staring. Tasha blushes, then clears her throat.
21) 28) dialog: I have an interview later. Wanna go get something to eat?
21) 30) dialog: Yale. Alumni admission interview. I applied Early Decision. Natasha shakes her head.
21) 32) dialog: I’m hungry?
21) 34) dialog: Coffee then? Or tea or soda or bottled water?
21) 36) dialog: Why not? Besides, I’m pretty sure you owe me your life since I just saved it.
21) 37) text: Daniel and Tasha sit across from each other at a Tasha checks the time on her phone: 10:00 A.M.
21) 38) dialog: Wait. Why aren’t you in school?
21) 40) dialog: Not much. My notebook. I carry it pretty much everywhere I go. Daniel pulls out a black notebook. Flips through Tasha glances at it. Sees the handwritten blocks
21) 42) dialog: No, I just kind of dabble in it. For fun. Next year I‘ll be pre-med. Self-conscious, Daniel quickly puts the notebook bag. Tasha notices, leans in.

21) 48) dialog: Thousands of love songs. Poetry. The institution of marriage.
21) 50) dialog: I love chocolate. Tasha laughs, too.
21) 51) dialog: You say it’s just words on paper, but you have to admit all those people are feeling something.
21) 53) dialog: And you're okay with believing that life has no meaning?
21) 55) dialog: Are your parents married?
21) 57) dialog: So no fate, no magic, no meant-to- be for you? 31.
21) 59) dialog: I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone so charmingly deluded.
21) 61) dialog: I find it interesting. (beat, then) What if I told you I could get you to fall in love with me scientifically? Without chocolate.
21) 63) dialog: I’m serious. It’s a thing. The New York Times had an article about it. Researchers put a bunch of couples in a lab and had them ask each other a bunch of intimate questions. Also, they had to stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes without talking.
21) 65) dialog: And yet, it’s a real thing. Daniel and Natasha stand in line at the register, waiting pay. Daniel has his phone out.
21) 66) dialog: There are thirty-six questions. How about I choose ten randomly.
21) 68) dialog: Great. Question number one, what are the five key ingredients to falling in love? 32.
21) 70) dialog: Do you even have a soul?
21) 72) dialog: Well, my ingredients are friendship and chemistry.
21) 74) dialog: I think some kind of moral compass is important. And let’s see... Physical attraction and the X factor.
21) 76) dialog: Don’t worry. We already have it. He smiles charmingly. A strand of Daniel’s hair falls int his face. He puts it behind his ear.
21) 78) dialog: It's Daniel. And give me today.
21) 80) dialog: Okay. I’1l walk you there. 33.

22) 3) dialog: Yep. And while we’re walking... Daniel takes out his phone.
22) 4) dialog: You ready for more questions?
22) 6) dialog: Persistent. Now, question number two: Would you like to be famous and how?
22) 8) dialog: I'd be a famous poet laureate.
22) 10) dialog: Broke with money But rich with words.
22) 12) dialog: Offers wise and poetic counsel. Tasha makes some gagging sounds.
22) 13) dialog: Be cynical all you want, but many a life has been saved by poetry. 34.
22) 15) dialog: What about you? What kind of fame do you want?
22) 17) dialog: You know, all dictators think they’re benevolent. Even the ones holding machetes.
22) 19) dialog: But what if what’s good for one person is not good for another?
22) 21) dialog: Touché. She glances at him, feeling a surprising connection. They stop at a corner, waiting for the light to change. We enter a MUSICAL MONTAGE of them walking through the ci as they get to know each other. The urban sounds melt awa a wistful piece of music takes over. Natasha soaks up the city she’s about to say goodbye to and Daniel continues t try and win her full attention. Daniel pulls out his phone again and begins scrolling thr questions. Natasha watches him.
22) 23) dialog: Yale. Interview.
22) 25) dialog: I’m fine. My parents have only been prepping me for this my entire life.
22) 27) dialog: Yup.
22) 29) dialog: It doesn’t matter what I want.
22) 31) dialog: And what about yours? You sound like you’ve got it all figured out.
22) 33) dialog: That’s so practical. Have you always known what you wanted to be?
22) 35) dialog: So, it’s not something you're passionate about? She shrugs. 36.
22) 37) dialog: It's a long life to spend doing something you’re only ‘meh’ about.
22) 39) dialog: Are you secretly my father?
22) 41) dialog: Honestly? If I had my way, yeah. This track I’m on is too predictable. Yale. Medical school. Residency. Marriage. Children. Retirement. Nursing home. Funeral home. Cemetery. (then) People have big, beautiful brains! We invent things that fly. We are capable of anything under the sun. We are capable of big lives. (MORE )
22) 43) dialog: How great would it be if we all went after the things we actually believed in? Their eyes meet. She’s inspired by his passion.
23) 2) dialog: I can wait for you out here.
23) 4) dialog: Am I going to see you again?
23) 6) dialog: Let’s do that over. Do you want to see me again? A beat. Neither one moves... Daniel doesn’t wait for her reply.
23) 7) dialog: Never mind. I can see that you're a little stressed by this appointment...like I was before I saw you. Let’s try something. Daniel raises his arms laterally, away from his body.
23) 8) dialog: Lift your arms like this. 38. Natasha obliges, reluctantly. Daniel inches closer and cl to her, arms out.
23) 10) dialog: They say that something as simple as a hug can do wonders for stress.
23) 12) dialog: Mmmhmm, it’s science. Daniel stands face to face with Natasha, both of their ar outstretched, almost wrapping around one another. But the don’t touch.
23) 13) dialog: If this is goodbye, then let this hug be my parting gift. Okay? Tasha pulls him in. He holds her tight. Tasha lets her he drop onto his shoulder and her body relax into his arms.
23) 15) dialog: Let go, Daniel. Let her go. Daniel releases her. Tasha pulls back, smiles at him.
23) 17) dialog: (calling after her) You really don’t think we’ll see each other again, do you? She turns back to Daniel.
23) 19) dialog: The odds were that we'd never meet in the first place, you know. But we did. Daniel looks to the sky. Cracks a smile.
23) 21) dialog: Because I know this isn’t our last time together. Daniel’s naiveté upsets Tasha. Tears gather in her eyes.
25) 42) dialog: Hey.
25) 44) dialog: No hug. No “I’m so happy to see you"?
25) 46) dialog: Actually it’s Daniel. 45.
25) 51) dialog: So?
25) 53) dialog: Oh, that old thing? I postponed it.
25) 55) dialog: I didn’t burn the building to the ground, ‘Tash. I just moved it until later.
26) 0) text: Tasha shivers a little and rubs her hands down her forear from the cold. Daniel takes her jacket and helps her into
26) 2) dialog: Absolutely. 46.
26) 4) dialog: Instinct. How did your thing go?
26) 6) dialog: Looks like we have more time together.
27) 0) text: The Manhattan skyscrapers have been replaced by small, closely-packed stores with bright awnings. Harlem feels l like a city and more like a neighborhood. Almost everyone black. Tasha and Daniel walk down the street, talking.
27) 2) dialog: Yep. Not the most creative name in the world, I’1l give you that.
28) 1) dialog: My family didn’t enter the Black hair care business by chance. A STILL PHOTO OF DANIEL’S FAMILY COMES TO LIFE. 47.
28) 2) dialog: When Dae Hyun and Min Soo moved to New York, Dae Hyun’s cousin gave them a loan to open a Black Hair Care store. A photograph of a Korean plane suddenly moves, the plane lands in New York City. A photo of Dae Hyun’s COUSIN spri into action as he hands Daniel’s parents some cash. A Hai Care Store frozen in time suddenly bustles.
28) 3) dialog: His cousin had a similar store and it was thriving. As were stores other South Koreans had opened up. A wide shot reveals the cousin in front of a store, he go inside. A dozen other Black Hair Care Stores are alive an thriving on the block.
28) 4) dialog: And South Koreans didn’t dominate the Black hair care industry by chance. In the 1960s wigs made with South Korean hair were insanely popular in the African-American community. Various photographs of BLACK WOMEN come to life. As they down the street, wigs of every style are on display.
28) 5) dialog: So much so that the South Korean government banned the export of raw hair to ensure South Korean wigs could only be made in South Korea. That combined with the U.S. banning the import of wigs containing Chinese hair effectively solidified South Korea’s dominance in the wig market. The wig business evolved to the more general Black hair care business. Of which South Koreans currently control 60-80%.
28) 7) dialog: So this is it... 48. Daniel turns to Tasha, tugs his tie from side to side nervously.
28) 8) dialog: So, you should know that my dad’s really...
28) 10) dialog: Maybe you could just wait out here. Tasha lets the door go, stunned. Daniel reaches for the d
28) 11) dialog: I‘ll be right back. He sees the hurt in Tasha’s eyes, feels awful.
28) 12) dialog: I’m sorry, can I try that again? Tasha gives him a big smile. Daniel opens the door for Ta
28) 13) dialog: After you.
29) 1) dialog: Well, this is it... You need to go to the bathroom or anything? There's one in the back. Tasha shakes her head. He strangles the pouch with his ha Nervous.
29) 3) dialog: Not much to see. First two aisles are for hair. (MORE )
29) 5) dialog: Shampoo, conditioner, extensions, dyes, lots of chemical things I don’t understand. Aisle three is make-up. Four’s equipment. He glances at his dad, but he’s still busy.
29) 6) dialog: Do you need something? Tasha touches her hair, suddenly insecure.
29) 7) dialog: I didn’t mean a product. We have a fridge in the back with soda and stuff.
29) 9) dialog: Pink?
29) 11) dialog: Doesn't seem like your style.
29) 13) dialog: I think you would look beautiful with a giant pink afro.
29) 15) dialog: It would look like strawberry frosting. Daniel pulls a few strands of Tasha’s coils. He smiles. S smiles back. A small moment. 50.
29) 17) dialog: What’s up, Charlie?
29) 21) dialog: Jesus Christ, Charlie. Daniel angrily takes a step toward his brother, but Tasha grabs his hand, pulling him back. Daniel stops, links his fingers with hers and squeezes. Charlie makes a big show of looking down at their joined hands and then back up at them.
29) 28) dialog: Mom said I had to bring you this.
29) 40) dialog: Bae.
29) 45) dialog: We're leaving. 53. Daniel practically flings the pouch at his father. Then h reaches for Tasha’s hand and leads her toward the door.
30) 2) dialog: I’m sorry. Tasha’s giggles turn into all-out laughter. She clutches stomach as Daniel stares at her, unamused.
30) 4) dialog: I’m glad you think this is funny.
30) 6) dialog: Are we in a tragedy?
30) 8) dialog: I guess so. He steps closer, takes her hand and places it on his ches
30) 9) dialog: Seriously. I’m sorry. I’m sorry about my family. I’m sorry about everything, about the whole history of the world and all its racism and the unfairness of all of it. 54.
30) 11) dialog: I can and I do. Tasha warms to his earnestness.
30) 13) dialog: Thank you. (beat) I feel like I need a palate cleanser now. What’s your favorite place to go in the city?
30) 15) dialog: Really? Never been.
31) 0) text: Daniel and Tasha sit side by side.
31) 1) dialog: So, you ready for the next question?
31) 3) dialog: I‘ll take that as a yes. (searches) Alright, here we go. How do you feel about your relationship with your mother and father?
31) 5) dialog: Well. You met my dad...it’s complicated. Of course I love him, but you can love someone and still have a not-so-great relationship with them, you know? (shrugs) Sometimes I feel like we’re on opposite sides of a soundproofed, glass wall. We can see each other but we can’t hear each other. The train brakes suddenly and jostles them even closer together. She doesn’t move away.
31) 7) dialog: Pretty good. She’s kind of like me. She paints.
31) 9) dialog: I guess so. (then) Now your turn. Tasha rolls her eyes. She nods.
31) 10) dialog: I‘1l make it easy on you. You can just give me a thumbs up or thumbs down, okay?
31) 11) dialog: Mom? Tasha gives the thumbs up. 56.
31) 12) dialog: Way up?
31) 14) dialog: Dad? Tasha gives the thumbs down.
31) 15) dialog: Way down?
31) 17) dialog: She’s playing Prince. Kind of a coincidence, don’t you think? Tasha rolls her eyes. The Musician is so passionate and the tune is so infectio that an ELDERLY PASSENGER starts to loudly hum along. As song goes on, OTHER PASSENGERS hum as well. Daniel smiles big at Tasha as he joins in.
32) 0) text: Tasha and Daniel wander through the minimal dark space. Spotlights shine on Meteorites. Natasha runs her hand acr the metal-cold surface of a pockmarked rock and ske close her eyes, fingering the divots. Daniel comes close, watch her. She turns to him, her voice a whisper.
32) 2) dialog: You’re like a kid in a candy store.
32) 4) dialog: The way you talk about this stuff, you should be pursuing astronomy. Natasha walks off into the darkness of the exhibition spa
32) 6) dialog: But this is what you love. Natasha stands in the darkness, just outside the spotligh 58.

34) 1) dialog: That was...really something. Tasha doesn’t hear him. She checks the time on her phone again: 1:01 PM. She slides her hand away from Daniel's.
34) 2) dialog: Did I say something wrong?
34) 4) dialog: Honestly, I don’t think it’s weird at all. Plus, you’ve met my family...we’re definitely out of the stranger zone. Natasha softens. At ease.
34) 6) dialog: I don’t know...I just feel connected to you. A beat. Natasha’s belly growls. Their laughter relieves t romantic tension. 61.
34) 7) dialog: You like Korean food?
35) 0) text: Music plays as Daniel and Tasha make their way through th densely packed streets of Koreatown. Neon signs in Korean street vendors, bicycles, and the smell of delicious food wafting in the air. Natasha sees Korean people exiting a building dragging bi suitcases. She SIGHS, the weight of the world on her shoulders. Daniel notices. She brushes it off, moving on the street. They take a quick SELFIE together as the musi ends.
35) 2) dialog: People always ask where I’m from. I used to say here, but then they ask where are you really from, and then I say Korea.
35) 4) dialog: Why not?
35) 6) dialog: I love how simple this is for you.
35) 8) dialog: Well, your solution to everything is to tell the truth. I struggle with my identity and you tell me just to say what’s true.
35) 10) dialog: Do people do it to you?
35) 12) dialog: Oh no.
35) 14) dialog: Did the other kids--
35) 16) dialog: Well, you should. Natasha deflects.
35) 18) dialog: Turn around. The pair stand at a nondescript doorway. Confused, Tasha looks to Daniel.
35) 19) dialog: Trust me. He takes her hand and they head inside, the sound of peop greeting them in Korean “Annyeonghaseyo” echoes. 63.
36) 0) text: Daniel and Tasha sit at a booth in a small hole-in-the-wa joint. Tasha looks over the menu.
36) 1) dialog: What do you think?
36) 4) dialog: (in Korean) We'll have two seafood soon dubu, kalbi, and pa jun. The waitress nods and then walks off.
36) 6) dialog: Awesome, right? It takes all the mystery out of food service. When will my waiter appear? When will I get the check?
36) 8) dialog: Don’t worry about her. Try this... Daniel pulls the soup bowl towards him.
36) 9) dialog: This is soon dubu. Tasha watches as he cracks the egg into the soup. She doe the same, then dips her spoon in and takes a bite.
36) 11) dialog: Oh, no. That’s the norebang. (off her look) Korean karaoke.
36) 13) dialog: They have private rooms. Koreans are all about embarrassing themselves in private. A beat, then a mischievous look comes over Daniel’s face.
37) 1) text: A small, dimly lit room. Plush, red leather couches. A la square coffee table sits in front of the couch. On it, a microphone and a remote. Next to the door there’s a large 65. Daniel pours over the thick song book, he’s been flipping a while, agonizing over it. Natasha watches him.
37) 3) dialog: This is norebang. You don’t choose a song. A song chooses you.
37) 5) dialog: Isn’t it?
37) 7) dialog: Stars are important.
