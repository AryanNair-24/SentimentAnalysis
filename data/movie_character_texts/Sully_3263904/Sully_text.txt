And it is too quiet in here. So he remotes on the TV. Every channel he checks is focused on the flight 1549 MIRACLE ON THE HUDSON. Shots of the PLANE IN THE WATER, PASSENGERS on the wings and in the emergency rafts. Ecstatic SURVIVORS hugging on the docks. Surviving passenger BARRY LEONARD, 50, handsome and amazed, is shivering with cold and joy while being interviewed by a TV reporter.

11) 8) dialog: This was not a crash. It was not a ditching. We knew what we were executing. A forced water landing.
11) 10) dialog: There was simply not enough altitude. The river was the only place long enough, wide enough, and smooth enough to even attempt to land the airplane safely.
11) 12) dialog: As I began the left turn, I realized I couldn’t make it back. It would have ruled out all other options. Returning would have been a mistake.

32) 43) dialog: The left engine... it might have still been idling. And the Airbus computer simulations... they say I could have made it back. Lorrie’s worry is an unspoken sound.

You have allowed no time for analysis and decision making. And with these sims, you have taken all the humanity out of the cockpit.
