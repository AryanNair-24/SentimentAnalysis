14) 1) dialog: Finally.
14) 3) dialog: I just wanted to hear your voice on the phone. Been hearing everyone else’s. You'd be amazed at how many ‘cousins’ you have.
15) 0) text: Driver finally makes the turn and stops outside the hotel. Cameras press up against the window, strobing Sully like a night at Studio 54. A BELLMAN opens the back door of the Town Car and the rush of noise is deafening. Sully has to yank it shut again to hear Lorrie. (CONTINUED)
16) 1) dialog: Pretty quiet here, too. Sully’s door gets opened again. Mayhem in the streets. Chants of “Sully... Sully... Sully.”

20) 0) text: The SILHOUETTES of several photographers and reporters shadow the front window as -- Lorrie crosses in front, dialing the home phone. She walks downstairs as she waits. After several rings, it’s picked up.
20) 1) dialog: I’m thinking about running over the press with the car. Self- defense. Think a jury would convict?

21) 7) dialog: Honey. I’ve been waiting all day. This is later. Are you okay? (CONTINUED)

32) 1) dialog: I’m sure you were fine.
32) 3) dialog: How long before we get you back?
32) 5) dialog: The girls miss you. I miss you. Lorrie peeks out the curtain. All the media trucks remain.
32) 6) dialog: Are they paying you to do all this media stuff, at least?
32) 8) dialog: Wish the bank felt the same way. Lorrie reaches their bedroom, only her side of the bed slept in. She takes an open envelope off the nightstand. It’s a bank statement.
32) 12) dialog: It's just... we got another notice about the space in Butte County.
32) 14) dialog: You've been saying that for nine months, Sully, and it’s still vacant.
32) 16) dialog: If we lose that space, it feels like the next domino to fall... is the house.

32) 38) dialog: What fault? You won. They can’t take that away from you. (CONTINUED)
32) 42) dialog: You’re scaring me. Sully, what’s going on? Long silence.
32) 45) dialog: Why did you do it? Sully. Land in the water? Sully hears the ROAR OF APPLAUSE and laughter from the “LETTERMAN” SHOW, in direct contrast to how far away his wife and his old life feel.
32) 46) dialog: Wasn’t that the most dangerous thing you could have done?
32) 50) dialog: Now all we have to do is survive surviving. Long silence. Two people breathing, unable to find the words.

60) 0) text: Sully is now running across 12th Avenue and headed for the Hudson. He’s at a full clip, as if chased. The CAMERA GETS so TIGHT ON his face, the entire world is his breathing, his breath like smoke signals in the frigid night. He hears the voices of LORRIE, her slip of doubt... of SKILES, backing him up all the way... of his MOTHER, her pride clear... of MIKE CLEARY, about the left engine still being alive... of L.T. COOK, saying details are the difference between life and death... never stop flying the plane... An endless stream of VOICES, all overlapping into a cacophonous attack. Inescapable. Even his running is a trap.

151) 2) dialog: For the first time, just now, I realized that there were 155 people on that plane. And you were one of them. More tears. Tears of relief and joy.
151) 3) dialog: I almost lost you. The girls almost lost you.

151) 9) dialog: I love you.
