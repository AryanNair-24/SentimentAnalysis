2) 373) dialog: It was that long ago. It was in another lifetime.
2) 375) dialog: Look, if we weren't trying to impress some guy we wouldn't even be here.

2) 489) text: Noelle and Donna sit on sections of the ruined porch, che on mussels and washing them down with stream water from a battered metal pan. Joe is butchering the sea cucumber on plank-
2) 492) dialog: Kelp.
2) 494) dialog: Frankie steams them in white wine with ginger. Donna gives her a look- NOELLE (shrugs) On a bed of saffron couscous. It's one of the appetizers. I memorized them.
2) 502) dialog: NOELLE (reading) "-next year I can go back to finish with school. I offered to get on at the cannery to help out when we were in town, but Papa says there is too much trash working there. He was a logger but fell while he was topping and now has headaches and dizziness that prevent him from many of the trades other men pursue. This way, he says, we can live in the Great Outdoors and operate our own business at the same time, which is every man's true desire. Mother doesn't care for it."
2) 503) text: NOELLE (reading) "We have transported a dozen breeding pairs of the blue-pelt foxes and put them in their pens. They are lovely to look at but nervous and I need to mind my fingers when I am near them. When the vixens are ready to bear we will separate them to be alone with their litter. Papa is building a fish trap in the stream, as he hopes to catch the returning chum for fox- food. I expect it will be a hard life, but work is scarce back in town and Papa's spirits were getting low. The people who built our little house tried to make it fishing and rowing out for stray logs to sell back to the mill, but they gave up after a few seasons. Mother goes on about how she will miss female company and that I will have to be her special friend. I know that Papa thinks he has been a disappointment to her, and sometimes she doesn't do much to hide it. I will be lonely here, I can tell, but it should be a great adventure, like Caddie in Caddie Woodlawn. I will try to be a aithful writer, Dear Diary, and tell you my innermost thoughts." Noelle puts the diary in her lap looks at them- Revision 8/05/98 93.
2) 505) dialog: Tomorrow night.
2) 529) text: Joe lights a stick with some dry moss wrapped around it w Donna's lighter. Noelle arrives and lays the wood down. J lights several sections of the pile. It begins to smoke, then flames start up-
2) 534) dialog: Somebody who doesn't want to kill us. Donna gives Noelle a hard look-
2) 537) dialog: There's no use pretending-
2) 543) dialog: Where'd you learn all this stuff?
2) 545) dialog: You did lots of stuff with him?
2) 547) dialog: My father's a composer. My real father.
2) 549) dialog: I didn't. She split up with him- you know- before.
2) 551) dialog: Bobby was your half-brother?
2) 553) dialog: You ever live together? 6/4/98 97.
2) 555) dialog: I've got two half-sisters and a half- brother.
2) 558) dialog: She doesn't want me to.
2) 560) dialog: No. Joe glances at her, doesn't pursue it-
2) 561) dialog: You don't think we're gonna get rescued, do you?
2) 563) dialog: Think we'll catch anything?
2) 565) dialog: "The house is small, but cozy now that we have cleaned it up and made it our own. (more) 6/4/98 98.
2) 566) dialog: I have my own room, and at night I can hear the owls calling back in the woods and our foxes yipping when something wild comes by. Yesterday I saw whales feeding in the inlet, going under for awhile then bursting up through the surface with a great spouting of air and crying of gulls. There are blueberries everywhere. My fingers are stained purple with them, though Mother insists I will be attacked by bears if I stray too far from the house. Papa's headaches are better and I help him clear the fish trap and prepare the feed for the animals. It is unpleasant, sticky work, but must be done. I have gotten stronger handling the skiff and Mother chides Papa for making a boy of me, but I don't mind. The days it doesn't rain are God's glory and most of our vixens are close to giving birth. Some days I will go for hours without speaking, and feel I am changing, perhaps posessed by the soul of some long-dead Indian girl, or perhaps the spirit of a she- wolf. This morning I snuck up on Papa felling a spruce for the fireplace and watched him for a long time without him seeing me. Perhaps I shall learn to become invisible. I made blueberry pancakes. Mother says if she eats any more fish she will grow fins and swim back to town. At night she has me kneel with her to pray." Noelle lays the diary down-
2) 570) dialog: "The terrible birthing has begun. We think one of the vixens has eaten her litter. The kits, the ones that survived, are lovely once their eyes open. Papa told me not to handle them but when he is off sometimes I do. Their heads are squarish and fluffy." She closes the diary and shuts the clasp with finality- DONNA (smiles) Fox babies.
2) 579) dialog: "Winter has locked us in its icy embrace. The pelts of the animals are thick and bluish and our home is blanketed with snow. Papa calls it Limbo, because it sure isn't Heaven and it's too cold to be Hell. Mother wondered about Purgatory, but he said no, Purgatory has an end to it. Don't torture me so, said Mother.
2) 580) dialog: Noelle sits up by the treeline, crying, watching Joe in t distance-
2) 581) dialog: The salmon we dried have run out. The kits are eating solid food now and it is hard to keep up with them. Papa went to the far side of the island and shot a pair of sea lions, but could only bring one back without tipping over in the skiff. I had to help him with the cross-cut saw, breaking it down to pieces that we keep frozen in the shed. Papa said it's just meat but I tried not to look at what I was doing: The other sea lion had been gotten to by a bear when Papa rowed back.
2) 583) dialog: We put a piece of the frozen meat in each of the pens and the foxes fight over it and gnaw at it and the outside melts from the heat of their little tongues. Mother won't deal with them anymore. She has grown silent with the shorter, darker days, and only now and again will she break out into one of her Bible songs. She asks me to join her, but we don't harmonize well.
2) 585) dialog: I have a dream about Fox. He is a young man who comes for me on snowshoes, dressed in the blue pelts. (more) 108 109 110 6/4/98 101.
2) 586) dialog: His skin and hair are dark but His eyes are ice-blue. All the others here are paired, He says, Papa and Mother, the sires and the vixens, but I am alone and He can't let that continue. Sometimes in the dream He stays with us, but usully He picks me up and carries me to His own island. Papa says if we can get the animals through the winter they are a Gold Mine. He says fortunes have been started on less. He says if he keeps having his dizziness I will have to go hunting with him the next time. The burns from where Mother hit him with the bacon grease are only pink now, healing, though the hair doesn't grow on that part of his jaw. I am sewing a sampler." She closes the diary. Donna and Joe watch the fire, think
2) 589) dialog: Noelle stands back in the trees, watching mutely, the sal slung over her shoulder with a cord through its gills-
2) 592) dialog: Yeah.
2) 595) dialog: Nobody's coming.
2) 597) dialog: In two weeks how many planes have we seen? Zero.
2) 602) dialog: People were after him-
2) 605) dialog: Stupid-
2) 607) dialog: Trying to impress your boyfriend, drag us out on a boat-
2) 609) dialog: It's true.
2) 612) dialog: Yeah, right-
2) 615) dialog: He's not my father.
2) 617) dialog: What's that mean?
2) 619) dialog: That's not true.
2) 621) dialog: You wouldn't let him-
2) 623) dialog: Every Christmas-
2) 625) dialog: He sent me a bike, he sent me a watch, he sent me a dollhouse-
2) 630) dialog: I'm great. I'm kickin- DONNA (moving) Let me feel your forehead- Noelle pushes her hand away-
2) 631) dialog: Leave me alone! Donna backs off. She uses a piece of seaweed to pick up t hot stone, offers Noelle the salmon-
2) 634) dialog: "I was the one who found them. It was time to clean the scat from the pens so I had the shovel and the buckets and then there was blood everywhere in the snow. All of them torn and smashed, even my little kits. A bear, says Papa, though when has a bear got into a half-dozen different pens without breaking the gates? Mother says nothing, but she is only a black spot these days, and refused to celebrate Christmas. The pelts are ruined, of course, worthless, and our long care is for naught. Papa couldn't speak when he saw them. He says his head hurts trying to think a way out of our dilemma. Joe shoots a look at Donna to see how she is taking this-
2) 635) dialog: I dreamed that Fox came and was angry for what we let happen, that He held me down on the snow and I felt His hot breath on my face, felt it bitter in my throat, and felt his ice-eyes cutting into me. I wish He would come soon. Mother sleeps with me now and it is cramped and tense. You would think another body under the covers would bring warmth, but I wake feeling drained, like she has pulled all the heat from me. I am doing the cooking now and my eyes are always red from the smoke. The wood is too big for the cookstove, but the axe has gone missing and we can't break it down. Mother says Hell is a cold place. Maybe I am the soul not of a she- wolf, but of a soaring bird that flies south every winter, and my heart is so sick because I am not supposed to be here in this cold, this dark, this wet. Maybe I am like the air in this house, the air that does not move when Papa and Mother pass in silence, dead, smoky air that smells of wool and old bacon. Tears begin to roll down Noelle's cheeks as she reads- 116 6/4/98 106.
2) 636) dialog: We threw the animals on the rocks for the tide to deal with. Papa cried."
2) 639) text: Over Noelle's shoulder we see a FLOAT PLANE flying over t other side of the inlet. Suddenly it banks and heads righ toward her-
2) 640) dialog: Excited, she starts to yell-
2) 641) dialog: It's coming! It's coming!
2) 645) dialog: Noelle is in the FG as the float plane lands in the inlet taxis straight toward her-
2) 660) dialog: Noelle is shaking again. Donna puts her arms around her, grim-
2) 673) dialog: Noelle watch, Donna reassuring her daughter-
2) 691) dialog: You think he might tell those men? And bring them back here?
2) 695) dialog: How do you know?
2) 697) dialog: Like you could tell that Dwayne in Colorado Springs wasn't cheating on you with the cocktail waitress-
2) 699) dialog: Or that Lyle would never hit you-
2) 701) dialog: But you didn't see it coming, did you?
2) 720) dialog: We won't bury her on the island. She made me promise. She whispered it, hissed it in my ear one night when she was laying hard beside me in bed. "Promise me". She wouldn't listen to anything else. We had come back from looking for deer, Papa and me, signs at the salt lick but nothing to shoot at. I was putting his rifle back where he hid it in the shed roof when I heard him cry out. He wouldn't let me in at first, though I hollered and struck at the door. He opened up when he'd got her down on the table, but I saw the black mark around her neck where the cord was. The fire had gone out, so our breath was showing, Papa and me, and it was like long white sighs of grief in the room and her mouth open and hair crispy to the touch. We wrapped her in the afghan, then I got the fire going while Papa just sat. Nothing to say. Later we found the note and she told how the animals were Satan's handmaidens, how their sharp little eyes would not give her peace so she killed them and threw the axe in the woods. 'We have looked into ourselves,' she wrote, ‘and what is there condemns us.' We'll take her off the island come first thaw. If Fox comes then, padding through the trees to be my mate, He will find us gone. 123 6/4/98 114. Donna and Noelle lock eyes for a long moment -
2) 722) dialog: That's it. The last entry. Donna nods-
2) 724) dialog: Who?
2) 726) dialog: She was crazy.
2) 748) dialog: Or those men. Donna looks at her daughter, then at Joe. The BUZZ of the plane gets louder. Donna looks to the plane, approaching, and makes up her mind-
