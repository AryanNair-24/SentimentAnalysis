1) 102) dialog: It's been known to happen. They're pretty much hard-wired, fish, not many options. People, though, they've got bigger brains, they can guess at the future, make decisions-

2) 124) dialog: Practically strangers.
2) 126) dialog: Half-brothers.
2) 128) dialog: The Orca Princess.
2) 141) dialog: Joe watches from his corner-
2) 151) dialog: There's a lot of factors. There's tide- is it with you, are you plowing into it, is it slack, where's the moon in its cycle- there's wind, which can jump around on you when you're ducking in and out of these islands- there's the size of the channel you're going through, the configuration of the bottom-
2) 153) dialog: Yeah- as much as you can know it. It's like you spend enough time with somebody, even if you don't see them for a long while, you still recognize their moods.
2) 155) dialog: What'd you expect? 6/4/98 62.
2) 157) dialog: I had the Health Department over this morning, they sprayed the walls down. She smiles, indicates his CD collection-

2) 218) dialog: Oh. .
2) 220) dialog: I can get rid of whatever-
2) 222) dialog: It's not that big a deal. I already bought new sheets- in case you came over- DONNA (pleased) Really?
2) 223) dialog: Yeah. Donna considers him, the wheels turning- DONNA (quietly) Uh-oh.
2) 247) dialog: I don't know- I work with her. She's a nice kid. She's-- funny-
2) 250) dialog: In a morbid kind of way, yeah.
2) 252) dialog: I never gave it much thought. She's a kid. Noelle! He waves to Noelle, who comes down the float carrying a b with her stuff for the trip- NOELLE (waves) Hey. Donna cli Noelle. aboard- Noelle is Joe takes 6/4/98 70. DONNA (sotto voce) Am I sharing sleeping quarters with you or with her?
2) 253) dialog: Up to you-

2) 275) dialog: They're going to come along for the first leg of the trip. BOBBY (surprised) Oh- great, terrific- we'll go the scenic route-
2) 276) dialog: I brought some extra groceries. BOBBY (recovering) Guy's been reheating beans on a hotplate for twenty years, I hate to see what he bought. You ladies can stake out your territories below while I get my charts on-line. Nice to have you aboard. 68 69 70 6/4/98 72.
2) 280) dialog: The first night maybe you throw some water on your face, take your clothes off, crawl under the sheets-- it seems like minutes before they yank you out of bed again. You pick the money fish out of the web, ice em down, make another set- the second night you sleep in your boots, maybe take your jacket off, on top of the rack. The third night you might not make it below- by the end of the week you just find someplace safe to lean on and close your eyes for a few minutes. I've slept on fish.
2) 281) text: Sounds like Hell. Joe shrugs, a bit embarrassed- 6/4/98 73.
2) 282) dialog: People get hooked on it.
2) 284) dialog: It's the thing itself- you know? You go out, you find the fish, you pull em out of the ocean. You're right there with it. Everything else is like second-hand- people work in canneries, they sell real. estate, they sell t-shirts, whatever. What if you couldn't sing anymore, you had to- what- work in a record store?
2) 286) dialog: Yeah.
2) 300) dialog: Not a great anchorage-
2) 302) dialog: Nope.
2) 325) dialog: Game's changed a lot since then. Now I'd just be another guy.
2) 338) dialog: No.
2) 340) dialog: Nobody comes back here. Bobby looks toward the companionway- BOBBY (sotto voce) We got a problem, Joe. The girls there- .
2) 341) dialog: I'm sorry, I should have asked- 6/4/98 78.
2) 343) dialog: What's going on?
2) 345) dialog: Tell me.
2) 347) dialog: Bobby -
2) 349) dialog: Oh, Christ-
2) 351) dialog: Are you carrying drugs on board?
2) 354) dialog: Aww- BOBBY . Hundreds of thousands of dollars, I get nervous and it's fish food. Turns out they had me confused with another boat, somebody réported them running too close to a pod of humpbacks. Bobby is very shaky now-
2) 356) dialog: That's where we're headed?
2) 358) dialog: What am I supposed to do?
2) 360) dialog: You bring me on board, you don't tell me shit- . 6/4/98 80.
2) 364) dialog: Stay up here for a bit. I'll figure something out to tell them.
2) 366) dialog: You don't deserve it. Joe heads for the cabin. Bobby listens to the night-
2) 378) dialog: Hey?
2) 381) dialog: The wind's coming down, so it should be pretty calm tonight. Tomorrow we're going to swing over to Tenakee, drop you off there- DONNA (hearing) What's that?
2) 382) dialog: It's this little town with a- DONNA (pointing) No, that- upstairs- Joe turns and they hear VOICES, raised and angry-
2) 384) dialog: No-- POP! A GUNSHOT rings out and Joe immediately pushes into little room, shutting the door behind him- : 78 79 80 81 6/4/98 82.
2) 386) dialog: Follow me! Just- whatever happens, follow me- He is up kneeling on the bed unlatching the little square plexiglas hatch overhead-
2) 396) dialog: Swim! Come on! POP! POP! POP! The three swim for shore as GUNSHOTS ring out over the black water. 82 83 6/4/98 83. About halfway to shore a FLASHLIGHT BEAM begins to play o the water, searching for them-
2) 400) dialog: Somebody shot Bobby.
2) 402) dialog: I don't know- he told me he was in trouble, just now- I don't know how they found us- .
2) 404) dialog: Take your clothes off-
2) 406) dialog: We've got to get the wet things off and huddle up together or we'll freeze. Hurry-
2) 408) dialog: There's nobody on this island. Help Noelle- . Noelle is shivering uncontrollably-
2) 410) dialog: If they come after us we're going to have to move, so put your shoes back on-
2) 413) dialog: The night doesn't last too long this time of year. We're gonna be alright.
2) 419) dialog: They're coming in. They all turn as the WHINE of SKIFF MOTOR starts up. Joe goes to one knee- JOE (to Noelle) Hop on. Noelle gets on his back and he stands, then begins to cli diagonally through the trees. Donna grabs the rest of the clothes and follows- 85 86 6/4/98 85.
2) 430) dialog: The boats are gone. He sits and pulls off his shoes and socks-
2) 432) dialog: No way to know. Listen, I'm sorry-- I had no idea till last night that something was wrong-
2) 434) dialog: Yeah.
2) 436) dialog: Little inlet on the backside of Kuleshov Island-
2) 438) dialog: Pretty much. I figure we should head around toward the channel while it's still light, hope we run into a stream. We'll be okay without food for awhile, but water- He wads a sock into the toe of one of his shoes and hands to Noelle-
2) 439) dialog: Try this.
2) 441) dialog: I'll be careful where I step. Go ahead. Noelle sticks her foot into the shoe, starts to lace it u Donna holds her head in her hands-
2) 443) dialog: It could be worse. It's not so cold yet- I've got my knife- Donna digs in her pocket and produces her cigarette light
2) 445) dialog: I don't know-- the smoke. They might not be too far.
2) 451) dialog: These have been milled.
2) 453) dialog: A long time ago.
2) 455) dialog: People used to raise foxes- for the pelts. It was a big deal for awhile.
2) 457) dialog: Land was available, I guess. People would hunt, fish, try to grow some things-
2) 467) dialog: Be a few days before anybody's likely to start calling around for us. Bobby wasn't keeping radio contact, nobody knows he cut over this way. 6/4/98 89.
2) 469) dialog: I don't know- depends on what shape you're in, what else you're doing.
2) 474) dialog: Couple days, maybe more- DONNA (dismayed) Days-
2) 475) dialog: I think we should hang here where we've got some shelter for a while, make sure those guys don't come back, then make a signal fire on the shore.
2) 477) dialog: No. Nobody does anything on Kuleshov. Donna looks around the ruined interior-
2) 482) dialog: I don't think so. Just take that batch you've got and rinse it in the stream. She heads for a pile of darker green seaweed left on a ro
2) 484) dialog: I think we can risk it tomorrow. We find a spot that doesn't go under when the tide is in.
2) 489) text: Noelle and Donna sit on sections of the ruined porch, che on mussels and washing them down with stream water from a battered metal pan. Joe is butchering the sea cucumber on plank-
2) 490) dialog: Sea cucumber. Lots of protein. 96 97 98 6/4/98 91.
2) 495) dialog: If we're here for a while I'll rig something up for cooking. Donna makes a bitter face and coughs out something green-
2) 497) dialog: Chew this, really slow-
2) 501) dialog: doe and Donna sit on the floor on the other side of the s basin fire from Noelle, listening- 6/4/98 NOELLE (reading, 0.S.) "Papa and Mother and I have come here to make a go at the fox farming trade. If this pans out, says Papa, "-
2) 507) dialog: We'll have something to look forward to. Like a soap opera.
2) 509) dialog: There's no telling how long it's going to be.
2) 514) dialog: Lester! Oley! Nothing. We drift around to see a FISHING BOAT, the Cape Fox, anchored thirty yards away-
2) 515) dialog: Hey! Somebody! Help! Help me! It is Vic, younger, who raises his head over the side of boat. He is drunk and sleepy-
2) 518) dialog: They're on the boat! Lester and Oley! Vic stands unsteadily, looks past Joe, puzzled- *
2) 520) dialog: Joe treads, circling. No sign of his boat or his friends. He takes a deep breath, dives under. BLACKNESS-
2) 523) dialog: Yeah- Donna looks over to Noelle, still sleeping,. huddled up against her under Joe's jacket-
2) 529) text: Joe lights a stick with some dry moss wrapped around it w Donna's lighter. Noelle arrives and lays the wood down. J lights several sections of the pile. It begins to smoke, then flames start up-
2) 530) dialog: We need to feed this a couple times a day. When the sky's like this it won't be easy to spot, but on a clear day-
2) 532) dialog: It rains, or the tide comes in too high, we'll probably have to start from scratch.
2) 535) dialog: It's a possibility.
2) 542) dialog: The fish go in through here, then they can't turn around and get out. That's the idea, anyway. This wire is kind of brittle.
2) 544) dialog: My old man taught me.
2) 546) dialog: When he had something to do and he needed somebody to swear at he took me along. Not the answer Noelle wanted to hear-
2) 548) dialog: How long did you live with him?
2) 550) dialog: Oh.
2) 552) dialog: Uh-huh.
2) 554) dialog: No. We saw each other around. He was a lot younger- different friends, different life.
2) 556) dialog: What are they like? NOELLE . I never met them. They're pretty little, still. I saw themina - picture- he was in People Magazine, my father.
2) 557) dialog: So you don't visit?
2) 559) dialog: So you write letters, phone calls- ?
2) 562) dialog: We have to stay strong until somebody comes. We need to stay warm, find things to eat. Just concentrate on that. She fingers the mesh on the trap-
2) 568) dialog: Sounds like it might be in the Depression. That's what- fifty, sixty years ago-
2) 575) dialog: Don't want the bears to dig him out. (to Noelle) I'm real sorry you had to see that.
2) 577) dialog: By the middle of the winter up here people kill each other cause they're bored. He took a risk and it didn't work out for him, that's all. He lifts up another stone, heaves it onto the pile-
2) 591) dialog: You don't worry about burning it up this way-.just flip it over after a minute- We SHIFT to see Donna and Noelle. Noelle sits away from them, sulking, shivering slightly- JOE (to Noelle) You laid the trap back in? 6/4/98 102.
2) 593) dialog: Indians used to smoke everything they couldn't eat, hope that it lasted the winter. : Donna is looking at the sky-
2) 599) dialog: There would have been more if they were searching for us here.
2) 601) dialog: Bobby may have told people at the dock we were headed in a different direction. He thought people were after him-
2) 604) dialog: Yeah. Anyway, they may be searching in a totally different area.
2) 644) dialog: Donna! Careful!
2) 651) dialog: I'm not sure who did it. We jumped off at night-- there were a couple fellas came in looking and we hid, then they pulled anchor- He shrugs-
2) 664) dialog: What's the story?
2) 666) dialog: Who sent you? Jack meets Joe's eyes for a long moment, then gives a fur look toward the shore-
2) 669) dialog: And if you saw them?
2) 671) dialog: Why'd you land, then?
2) 677) dialog: Right. Jack leans out and calls out to the women on shore-
