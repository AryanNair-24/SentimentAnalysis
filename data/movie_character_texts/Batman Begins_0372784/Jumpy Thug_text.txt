BATMAN IS ALREADY IN FRAME- his arm FLASHES forward with his CLOAK, WRAPS the Thug’s neck, YA him backwards into the shadows.. Jumpy Thug sees the other Thug DISAPPEAR... he OPENS FIRE STROBING the stacks, revealing INDISTINCT GLIMPSES of MOVEMENT. ELSEWHERE IN THE STACKS: Thugs REACT to the gunfire... Flass stands outside the stacks, gun drawn, listening. He moves back into the office.
