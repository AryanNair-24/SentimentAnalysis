25) 3) dialog: I'm Orin Helgesson, your ASMI Midwest Region Chapter President. But I'm not going to make you play Hail to the Chief. Not yet anyhow.
25) 6) dialog: Seriously, we've got a great line- up for ASMI `09, with our forward- looking theme, Let's Build a Bridge to the 22nd Century! Just so many innovations-- our newsletter, The ASMI-teer is now fully digital. So a lot of our breakout sessions will be dealing with this kind of "E- Commerce" sort of thing. (pause for polite applause)
25) 11) dialog: If you didn't pick up your Welcome Kits, be sure and see Mike Pyle, the gentleman in the-- what color's that sweater vest Mike?
25) 16) dialog: In the beige sweater vest. Great.
25) 25) dialog: ... The Two Diamonds are given every year to the agency that best exemplifies the ASMI decree: "To provide high quality insurance services and related products while maintaining Commitment to Community, Country and God." We have a record number of entries this year-- over 15 agencies competing. Good luck to you all.
25) 39) dialog: ... moment of silence for the man many considered to be the Michael Jordan of Mutual Insurance Agents. Roger Lemke.
25) 42) dialog: Were you there when they crucified my Lord? Were you there when they crucified my Lord?
28) 3) dialog: How ya doin'?
28) 8) dialog: You were in there? Marvelous. Did you like the part about E-Commerce?
28) 12) dialog: Terrific. It's the future y'know. Anyhow, I don't think we've...
28) 17) dialog: Whew boy. Tim, what can I say? I just-- we're all feeling it. I'm so sorry for the loss...
28) 24) dialog: And a pilot. Flew a Cessna.
28) 28) dialog: Come here, son.
28) 34) dialog: Tim, I know Bill's looking to retire and from the sound of it he's on the hook for a pretty sweet time share.
28) 38) dialog: I want to help him find a buyer, and God knows I'll try my darnedest. But-- and it pains me to say this-- there's a petition going around trying to rescind all of Northlands' Two Diamond Awards.
28) 42) dialog: I know. But let's be honest, one of the core tenets of the Two Diamonds is Commitment to God. And the way Roger passed on... well, some folks are saying that type of activity isn't entirely "godly."
28) 47) dialog: You have to understand, this isn't some namby-pamby local event. This is a regional convention, Tim. Now, I want to help you, but you're going to have to help yourself too.
28) 50) dialog: Let me give you a few extra drink coupons for Horizons. Get down there-- fellowship and network. Buy a few drinks. Let `em see the good side of Northlands Insurance-- the wholesome side, OK?
28) 54) dialog: Please. Orin. And if you need anything, Tim-- I mean anything-- I'm up in the Tiffany Suite. Room 411. Balcony overlooks the pool.
33) 3) dialog: ... In Your Name we pray Lord Jesus, Son of God, Author of our Salvation, our Redeemer, our Truth. Amen.
40) 5) dialog: Oh, and I suppose under a Dean Ziegler administration, we'd just abandon E-Commerce and all that, huh? What's your take, Ronald?
40) 21) dialog: To each his own, Tim. (gives Tim a kind wink) I'm teasing, of course. Well, I gotta run to an Executive Council meeting. You fellas really ought to check out Mike Pyle's Prop/Cas seminar...
40) 25) dialog: Mike's a dynamite orator. I think you'd enjoy it. We'll see ya.
46) 3) dialog: Like last year there'll be a few physical challenges...
46) 11) dialog: Course this should be considered a fun event, in the spirit of team building. You can find your first clue "under the sea." By which I mean in the pool area. So ready, set, race!
50) 4) dialog: OK guys, this is it. First team to complete this challenge wins the whole shootin' match. (unfurls a scroll, reads) ASMI's past is behind us; But our future looks nice; Let's Build a Bridge to the 22nd Century... by scaling this silo of ice!
50) 48) dialog: OK gang, that was Rick Martini with the National Chapter. Here's the deal. Since no one could do the final task, and since Joan and Tim were the first team to get here, we're just gonna go ahead and award them the first place prize. Unless anyone's got a problem with that?
50) 55) dialog: Yup. So here you guys go. Your $75 gift card for the Westdale Mall.
61) 44) dialog: What the heck's going on down there?!
61) 49) dialog: I'm calling security!
72) 3) dialog: Without any more ado, our keynote speaker, Iowa Insurance Commissioner, Mrs. Susan Voss!
75) 3) dialog: (self-deprecating, but proud) Tiffany Suite. Bit much. Perks of the Presidency, guess you'd say. Please. Have a seat on the davenport.
75) 6) dialog: Drink?
75) 10) dialog: Suit yourself.
75) 16) dialog: Between you and me-- this was a ploy by Mike Pyle. Trying to drive down the value of Northlands so he could get it on the cheap. 85. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
75) 21) dialog: I just made that happen. Poof. Gone. Rainmaker. (makes rain gesture) Northlands keeps its three previous Two Diamond Awards.
75) 26) dialog: One thing Roger Lemke knew, Tim? He knew that when you get all dolled up, go to the prom-- the Big Dance-- that you gotta be prepared to put out. To show a little teat. (off Tim's confused look) You ever hear of PayPal, Tim?
75) 31) dialog: Good. Thing you gotta ask yourself now is this: "Am I ready to dance? Am I ready to show a little TEAT?"
75) 35) dialog: Calm down, Orin. I'm sorry. Please, let's talk E-Commerce for a minute.
75) 38) dialog: Four years ago, the brain trust at ASMI National mandated we go "on- line" for everything. Billing, newsletter, the whole shebang. Now I'm almost 70-years-old-- I's about as likely to figure this deal out as I was to learn Chinese. Well, as you know Roger Lemke was a real whiz on the computer... 86. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
75) 44) dialog: So Roger's up here looking over this new system, and he gets one of these lightbulb-going-off kinda looks, the way he did. And he says, "Orin, with that newsletter going digital you're saving almost four grand a year in printing costs alone. Four grand. Pure profit." You see where this is going, Tim?
75) 48) dialog: PayPal. That's where. What has ASMI ever given Orin Helgesson? Huh? Not dime one. Sure as shoot not an opportunity to serve on the National Board. Have I not been a good President? Do I not deserve a little something?
75) 52) dialog: You're GODDAMN right I am!
75) 55) dialog: But I don't know the first blessed thing about this PayPal deal. Roger had the on-line know-how, not me.
75) 59) dialog: There aren't printing costs anymore, see? The ASMI-teer's digital. E- Commerce! Don't you get it, Tim? All that money-- almost 39-hundred dollars a year-- that goes into a PayPal account now. My PayPal account. But I've got no idea how to use it. 87. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
75) 65) dialog: Your performance in that scavenger hunt was first-rate. Then I see you in the pool making love to that floozy, I realize maybe you've got a bit of Lemke's, shall we say, moral ambiguity. I need that.
75) 69) dialog: Pontoon boats don't pay for themselves, Tim. Roger Lemke came to the prom. He showed me a little teat. I rewarded him with the Two Diamonds three years running. I'm prepared to do the same for you. What do you say? You take home those those Two Diamonds, Northlands' value skyrockets, Bill Krogstad retires to his time share. Everybody wins...
75) 78) dialog: OK, marvelous!
80) 3) dialog: My advice, Mike? Pull the trigger. I've pretty well convinced him that his company's in the crapper. 85- thousand is as low as I could possibly get him.
80) 7) dialog: Bill was real clear about that. You're buying his clients-- not his brand. You've done this before, Mike. The Northlands policies will simply roll over into your Allstate office in Milwaukee. Unless you want to keep a satellite branch up there in North Palookaville.
80) 12) dialog: Oh, and Mike-- we're square on my consultant's fee?
80) 16) dialog: Marvelous. Now just give me a second here...
81) 3) dialog: We're all systems go over here, Bill. 92. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
81) 9) dialog: I was able to get Pyle up to 81- thousand for you, Bill, which is pretty amazing given all the... the tribulations and that. Of course that number doesn't include my 15 percent consultant's fee.
101) 3) dialog: Oh, Tim. Just a sec.
105) 16) dialog: (terrified, through gag) Nmmmmmmmmm!
