0) 3) dialog: Ho-lee Christmas, knocked her outta the park, Roger! Out of the G-D park, you sonofagun! 2. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
11) 21) dialog: Know how Roger used to get down there to Cedar Rapids? To the ASMI Convention? Any idea?
11) 25) dialog: Flew himself. In a Cessna. Pilot. (a mournful beat) It was all worked out. I was going to ease into retirement in July while Roger transitioned into his ownership role.
11) 29) dialog: All worked out. Shit, Dione already put the down payment on a time share. Branson, Black Hills. Florida. Units all over the place.
11) 35) dialog: Yeah, whole deal. Now? Now I got my back up against Christ-knows-what. No Lemke, no buyer, the wife's spending like we won the goddamn Powerball. And what's worse, because of the way, y'know, the way Roger passed...
11) 40) dialog: (a nod, a sigh) Quote-unquote perverted, they're saying. Like Northlands has some kind of stain. Oh, I'm so goddamned tired...
11) 47) dialog: We need those Two Diamonds more than ever, Tim. If I'm going to sell this company, we need people to feel OK about the Northlands brand.
11) 51) dialog: I'd go myself but my daughter Kayla, the heavy one? She unearthed some Polack to marry her. I'm locked into that wedding over in Gladstone. No flex. Locked in. 12. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
11) 57) dialog: I'm not asking you to fill Roger Lemke's shoes. Not gonna happen. I'm asking you to deliver his presentation-- to bring me home those Two Diamonds.
11) 61) dialog: C'mon Tim. Lila's about as charismatic as a bag of hair.
11) 66) dialog: You were what, 16, when I gave you that filing job? Right after your mom passed? Raising yourself pretty much, living all alone. And I'm thinking, now here's a kid. Here's a kid who's gonna go places. (a hand on Tim's shoulder) And then, somehow, you kind of just didn't. Now, I guess it makes some sense-- a child loses both parents at an early age, becomes what you might call stunted. But cripes almighty, do you want to just sit there in your folks old house, just rot away in Brown Valley dating that...
11) 71) dialog: Tss, maybe three'll be a charm. (then, emotional)
15) 18) dialog: Can't believe I forgot to get this to you. Hang on, lemme...
15) 26) dialog: Ziegler is a cancer. Sonofabitch called one of Lemke's biggest clients-- Joyce ArmbrГјster? Smeared Roger's name and the Northlands' name. Frickin' poacher. Avoid Ziegler like the plague. The fella I got you rooming with, Ronald Wilkes-- that's who you stick by. 18. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
15) 38) dialog: Hey-hey! That kind of prep is pure Lemke! Didn't know any better, I'd say Roger's spirit had kind of climbed into you, just planted its seed inside you there. Atta boy!
15) 43) dialog: Said it before, I'll say it again: Your job, the office in Brown Valley-- all safe. What you need to worry about is getting down there and representing us the best you can. That's all you need to worry about.
34) 3) dialog: Tim. Bill Krogstad. Got a call from Orin Helgesson. Tells me he's worried about you. Tells me you're palling around with Dean Ziegler. Laughing at his jokes, buying him drinks...
34) 7) dialog: What's the ONE thing I told you to do? The one thing, Tim? Steer clear of Dean Ziegler. GODDAMNIT, you're lousing the whole thing up!
34) 11) dialog: Not now Dione.
36) 5) dialog: I sent you to ASMI to restore our image, Tim. One day into the deal you're lousing the whole thing up!
36) 10) dialog: Oh cripes, you know as well as I do that Polack's gonna head for the hills the second he gets his papers. But no, you want to end up in the poor house, Dione, we'll go. Let's just keep on cashing checks we don't have...
70) 3) dialog: Tim, Bill Krogstad again. Orin Helgesson told me about your little hootenanny in the pool there. Clear violation of ASMI's Morals Code-- meaning we lose our ASMI certification, we lose our Two Diamond rating, we lose our customers and I lose any chance of ANYONE buying my goddamn business.
70) 13) dialog: (to Photographer, despondent) Yah. Be there in a...
82) 3) dialog: Y'know what Orin, it's only a seven hour drive to Cedar Rapids. If I leave right now, I can be there first thing in the A-M and we can lock this sonofagun down.
82) 7) dialog: Hell yes. You bet. It's no problem. I'll be there in time to see the Two Diamond presentations-- not that that matters to me anymore! Thanks a million, Orin!
82) 14) dialog: Goddamnit, Dione, not now. This is happening. No flex on this one! 93. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
108) 34) dialog: 
108) 42) dialog: (to the audience) Sorry, folks. Guess it's against the law now for a business owner to sell his own business. Must've missed that constitutional amendment.
108) 47) dialog: (still playing to the crowd) Yeah, there's a guy you want running an agency, isn't it?
108) 59) dialog: Watch yourself, Lippe...
108) 63) dialog: You don't know what you're doing.
