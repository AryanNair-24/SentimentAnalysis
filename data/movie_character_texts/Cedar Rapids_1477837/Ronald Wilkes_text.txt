21) 34) dialog: You are Tim...?
21) 42) dialog: OK. You want to check out the room then?
22) 5) dialog: Yeah, you could do a lot worse. (a serious beat) Look Tim, I gotta put the cards on the table here. The reason we got the junior suite upgrade is because the hotel overbooked-- wedding or some such. Point being, they were asking folks to take on a third roommate to consolidate space. Now to me, being an independent owner, the savings of adding a third guy sounded like a real positive.
22) 10) dialog: But if you've got any qualms, I hear you L &amp; C, that's Loud &amp; Clear.
22) 15) dialog: No. Just hope he doesn't snore.
22) 21) dialog: This isn't Woodstock, Tim. It's a regional insurance convention. Whoever it is, I'm sure he'll be a straight shooter.
24) 5) dialog: So far it's just the one billboard north of St. Cloud. Course the traffic load would get me more eyeballs in the Twin Cities corridor, but at the end of the day, it's N-T- S. Not Too Shabby.
24) 16) dialog: Turn down the volume, Ziegler. You just got here, for Pete's sake.
24) 26) dialog: We drew the short straw with this pitiful reprobate, Tim. Dean, this is Tim Lippe.
24) 43) dialog: That line was unappealing last year, Dean. It remains so now.
24) 52) dialog: No one's buying the potty-mouth nonsense you're selling, Dean. Tim, you'll learn to ignore this degenerate before too long. Let's go hear what Orin has to say.
25) 22) dialog: Oh, Dean ran for President against Orin last year-- only got four votes. He's running again this year. He's just full of bluster.
25) 30) dialog: Yeah, it's gonna be brutal this year. I brought my A-game though.
25) 36) dialog: Heck yeah. It's the first year I've ever had a real shot. But the guy you really have to worry about is Mike Pyle. He owns the sixth largest Allstate agency in the Upper Midwest. The guy's a shark.
28) 111) dialog: You're married yourself, Ziegler. The heck's your moral compass?
28) 118) dialog: Oh jeez. You and Patti split? Sorry to hear that.
28) 131) dialog: ASMI isn't a vacation for everybody, Dean. End of the day, Tim's here to work and to win. For his agency.
28) 139) dialog: Joan Ostrowski-Fox.
28) 146) dialog: You fly in from Omaha, Joan?
28) 165) dialog: You guys met?
28) 176) dialog: Oh what the heck. Drambuie.
33) 6) dialog: Orin knows how to lead a prayer breakfast, tell you what.
33) 10) dialog: Little overwhelming? All this?
33) 14) dialog: Oh I hear ya L &amp; C. Loud and clear. I was the same way when I first came to ASMI. The deciding which break-out sessions to attend, plus the politics, the pressure, the not knowing who to trust...
40) 7) dialog: End of the day, you know I'm a big supporter of yours, Orin...
40) 11) dialog: Why would I stab you in the back, Dean, when I'm telling you to your face that I think you'd be a lousy President? 51. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
40) 30) dialog: It's 11 in the morning.
45) 5) dialog: Everything OK?
45) 24) dialog: Bill Hernandez?
50) 38) dialog: Really hard.
50) 51) dialog: Dangit. You could've done better, Wilkes.
60) 23) dialog: Can I buy the big-shot winners a drink? Coors Lite for Joan. And Tim, you want a pop? 69. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
60) 29) dialog: Cream sherry. Jeez, guess that victory really did go to your head.
60) 50) dialog: Negative. I'm pretty well married to Ronald Wilkes Insurance. I also do quite a bit of work with the St. Cloud Chamber. I'm Senior Warden at my church. So really, no time for a Mrs. Ronald Wilkes.
60) 54) dialog: Don't get me wrong, I have my guilty pleasures-- antiquing, I'm active in community theater. And I have to admit I'm a big enthusiast of the HBO program, The Wire. But shux, I haven't had a proper vacation in nine years.
60) 60) dialog: You know what you are Ziegler? You're what I call a real Richard.
60) 63) dialog: Mr. Richard Head.
60) 72) dialog: To Tim-- the young rookie comes in, takes the scavenger hunt. That right there is P-T. Prime Time.
60) 80) dialog: Come on Ziegler, this is supposed to be a clean game...
60) 122) dialog: The presentation's in 36 hours. I can't afford to be off my game. Frankly, neither can you, Tim.
60) 127) dialog: This is ridiculous, you guys. Told you, it closed an hour ago.
60) 130) dialog: Tim. Come on. This isn't you.
60) 134) dialog: You know what I mean. We've both worked our tails off. Why poop it away on...
69) 7) dialog: Hey, it's not Ronald Wilkes's job to judge you, Tim. End of the day, the Lord's got that covered. But am I disappointed? You bet I am. Heck, I'm all for having fun. But I didn't think you were one of these guys who comes down here only to get loaded and act like a derelict.
69) 16) dialog: What a couple of class acts. I'm running late for the prayer breakfast. Oh and Tim, Bill Krogstad's been trying to reach you all morning. FYI.
76) 14) dialog: Not a snowball's chance in Hades.
76) 18) dialog: (spots Tim O.S.) Hey there, Hangover Harry. 18 hours and counting. Got your guns loaded for the Two Diamonds, partner?
76) 23) dialog: Don't be nervous. You'll do fine. There's a prayer circle tonight before the entertainment program-- might help ease your mind.
83) 8) dialog: I'll go ahead and admit, this is an odd choice for an ASMI headliner. Budget crunch, I guess.
83) 15) dialog: What? Holy smokes. Does Tim know?
83) 23) dialog: Hey. Come on you guys. Cut it out.
83) 33) dialog: You met him two days ago, Ziegler.
87) 10) dialog: Oh jeez. D'you know where they were going? Any idea?
93) 9) dialog: You and me can go in, Joan. It'll be fine, I'm sure...
95) 7) dialog: We don't want any trouble, guys. We're just looking for our friend.
97) 20) dialog: (hard-core gangsta speak) I may look like some suit wearin' businessman to y'all. Truth is, I'm straight up gangsta. And I always keeps one in the chamber... (indicates the bulge in his pocket) ... in case you ponderin'. So I suggest for the time being that you let my nigga be. Muthafucka.
97) 23) dialog: Indeed. 101. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
98) 6) dialog: Run!
99) 13) dialog: In order to extricate Tim from what was clearly a volatile situation, I did, in fact, rely on my community theater training. I don't like to brag, but I do a pretty convincing Omar from the HBO program, The Wire. (beat, as a gangsta) Least them crackers back yonder seemed to buy it.
100) 10) dialog: Shoot, you could come work for me if you wanted.
108) 3) dialog: People sometimes say that promises are cheap. You know what Ronald Wilkes says to that? N-S-F. Not so fast. At the end of the day, a man's word is a sacred creed. And the word I give you at Ronald Wilkes Insurance is-- I will work for you. Thank you.
108) 73) dialog: Jesus Lippe, what did you do? Aw jeez. This is no good.
111) 6) dialog: It's not as cool as I thought it'd be. I don't think this is even real wood.
112) 16) dialog: Yeah. You bet.
112) 25) dialog: More time in a tightly enclosed space with Ziegler. Gee, sign me up.
112) 29) dialog: Actually, me too. The Ronimal could use a vacation.
116) 3) dialog: Can I be honest here, Tim?
116) 11) dialog: All's I'm saying is you might've wanted to hire an actor with some professional training...
