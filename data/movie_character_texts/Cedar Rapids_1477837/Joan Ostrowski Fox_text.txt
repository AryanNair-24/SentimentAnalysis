27) 27) dialog: Don't get lippy with me, mister.
27) 30) dialog: So do you play professional basketball, Tim? Because that's a pretty updated uniform there.
27) 34) dialog: Oh, is that where a bunch of guys sit around a table looking up the word "gullible" in a dictionary?
27) 38) dialog: Indeed I am. I'm here for ASMI, too. In from Oh-my-god, Nebraska. Just kidding-- Omaha. (wipes off some sweat) Ugh, I am gross, so I'm going to bid you farewell, Tim Lippe. See you at Horizons tonight?
27) 44) dialog: Unless you were planning on spying on me in the shower.
27) 47) dialog: God, I am evil. I need help.
28) 144) dialog: Here she is, Miss America.
28) 148) dialog: Yup. And boy are my arms tired.
28) 153) dialog: No, not really. I drove. Deanzie, let me say... (does Billy Crystal character) ... you look maah-velous!
28) 163) dialog: Hey! It's Tim "don't get lippy with me" Lippe.
28) 167) dialog: Oh yeah, and I was very naughty in there. I'm sorry about that, Tim.
28) 171) dialog: No I'm not.
28) 178) dialog: Lippe?
28) 193) dialog: Careful you don't get too loaded, Lippe, or I might have to take advantage of you.
38) 3) dialog: I'm a very bad girl. But I swear I only smoke in Cedar Rapids. Care for a Virginia Slim, Lippe? 48. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
38) 8) dialog: Whoa, what's wrong?
39) 5) dialog: D'you want me to kick his butt?

39) 21) dialog: No way. Really?
39) 28) dialog: I remember that. Massive disaster.
39) 32) dialog: You realize you just made it sound cool to be an insurance salesman? You are a hero, Lippe.
39) 38) dialog: No, I can tell. You're the Superman type. Kind of dweeby on the surface but a real frickin' stud underneath. They'd call you Insurance Man-- put a big red "I" on your chest...
39) 42) dialog: Well, you're welcome.
45) 7) dialog: Yeah, what was that call?
45) 14) dialog: 
45) 20) dialog: Really? Why?

45) 30) dialog: Heck yeah! I get to be Insurance Man's sidekick. We're going to kick some ASS!
46) 8) dialog: 
47) 10) dialog: Ooh, that's hot...
47) 14) dialog: Look at you...
47) 19) dialog: What a gyp. There are no stinkin' clues in here.
48) 5) dialog: Why would you possibly know that?
49) 18) dialog: Ugh. I'm gonna puke.
49) 24) dialog: (stunned, mouth full) Oh my God, did you just make a dick joke, Lippe?
50) 7) dialog: That doesn't even... There's no such thing as silo ice climbing.
50) 11) dialog: Of course you did. Well, you can do it then...
50) 15) dialog: You need to get over it, Lippe, cuz I'm not climbing jack.
50) 20) dialog: Come on Insurance Man-- leap tall buildings in a single bound and all that...
51) 10) dialog: Hi Millie! 62. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
51) 22) dialog: I'll just meet you inside.
58) 11) dialog: That's really nice. Cheers.

58) 25) dialog: Dream the impossible dream...
58) 29) dialog: C'mon, man. I mean fantasy-land stuff. What do you really want?
58) 34) dialog: Oh, screw him. He wants to sell, why don't you just buy Northlands?
58) 38) dialog: Why not? You could get a loan.
58) 42) dialog: You know the business. You know the clients. You actually care about your job. You'd be perfect. 66. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
58) 49) dialog: Yeah well, you can have mine.
58) 54) dialog: Tyler's ten. Ashley'll be eight next month. My little squirrels.
58) 58) dialog: My hubby. Rich Fox. Richie. We met when we were both Rotary exchange students in high school. Lived in Norway for a semester.
58) 62) dialog: I was such a spaz. Band geek, total ugly duckling-- braces, acne, the whole nine. I didn't even get boobs until college. Anyway, we ended up getting married sophomore year. Then kids. Then blah-blah-blah, and here we are. Richie's a Supervisor in the Parks Department now. For the County.
58) 67) dialog: I know it's effed up. And if I had it all to do over again, I don't know what I'd choose.
58) 72) dialog: But I don't have that option. So this is my fantasy-land, Tim. Cedar Rapids. ASMI. This. I come here, and for a few days I'm someone else. No kids. No husband. No responsibility. Wild woman. (an ironic growl) Sometimes a gal just needs a vacation from who she really is-- know what I mean, Lippe?
59) 5) dialog: One what?
59) 9) dialog: No, let's hear it...
59) 14) dialog: You wanna be on American Idol?
59) 22) dialog: That's great, Tim. You'll do it. I know you will. Very cool.
60) 3) dialog: Wanna get one for the road, stud?
60) 7) dialog: One nightcap. It'll loosen you up.
60) 12) dialog: What?
60) 31) dialog: Coors Lite's good for me, thanks. I gotta run wash my hands quick.
60) 85) dialog: Shots! (to the bartender) Kamikazes, good sir.
60) 91) dialog: Why wait for the church choir when you can take care of one of your dreams right now, dude?
60) 96) dialog: I know you can do it, Lippe. Go be my hero-- Insurance Man. 72. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
61) 3) dialog: Whaddaya say, Lippe? Take a dippy?
61) 8) dialog: So we stay in the shallow end. (starts removing clothes) And neither did I.
61) 15) dialog: So.
61) 19) dialog: So.
65) 8) dialog: Cuddle? Um. OK. 77. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
66) 3) dialog: No baby, you guys are playing at Papillion/La Vista. Ralston is next week...
66) 7) dialog: Hey. Did you not look at the schedule on the fridge? Did we not have this conversation 10 minutes before I left? (listens, sighs) No, no, no. The playoffs are in Ralston. This is the last regular season game. He actually has a chance to play, Richie. Christ.
66) 10) dialog: Fine, but watch your speed on 84th by Giles Road. Chris Beeler's gotten busted twice right there. By that golf course.
66) 18) dialog: Crisis on the home front. Sorry if I woke you up.
66) 25) dialog: Your cell phone kept ringing in your little fanny pack thing, so I shut it off. When I saw the discs, I figured I'd take a look. It's a solid presentation.
66) 29) dialog: Yeah, I see that.
66) 34) dialog: It's so stupid-- but everyone basically treated us like the Brangelina of ASMI for a while there. It ended two years ago. He was getting into some pretty weird stuff... as we all know now.
66) 37) dialog: Come on, Lippe. It doesn't matter. You knew, didn't you?
66) 43) dialog: Tell me you're not jealous. You can't be jealous. The guy's dead.
66) 47) dialog: As good? Tim, Roger was a small- minded, egotistical jerk. You're an infinitely better man than he was.
66) 53) dialog: Why? I don't know. I don't know. I guess I probably maybe don't like myself very much. I don't know.
66) 62) dialog: What are you talking about?
66) 66) dialog: What this? What are you talking about? There's no this. There's no us. I have a family. 80. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
66) 72) dialog: What about it? I told you, what I do here... In Cedar Rapids... It stays here.
66) 77) dialog: Come on, Tim. We're adults here. You're acting like a child...
83) 6) dialog: We used to get bands, Ronald. Real bands. Kansas. REO Speedwagon... Remember REO let me get on stage and play tambourine?
83) 17) dialog: Don't look at me. I don't think Tim likes me very much anymore.
83) 21) dialog: Fuck off, Dean. Jackass.
91) 4) dialog: Oh man. This place is bad news.
93) 7) dialog: So you're sending me into that shithole? How chivalrous, Dean.
95) 5) dialog: (not missing a beat) Thanks. Thank you. That's nice.
97) 3) dialog: Oh shit.
99) 5) dialog: Oh my God, Tim. Are you OK?
100) 8) dialog: You'll find another job, Lippe. Maybe even move to a new town.
100) 15) dialog: (to Dean &amp; Ronald) Get some sleep you guys. I'll stay up with him-- make sure he doesn't chew his arm off.
100) 25) dialog: It doesn't matter. Here, lie down, Lippe.
100) 28) dialog: 
103) 3) dialog: Oh shit...
108) 73) dialog: Jesus Lippe, what did you do? Aw jeez. This is no good.
112) 5) dialog: Deep subject. D'aar. Get it? (punches his arm) I told you you were a hero, Lippe. Insurance Man saves the day!
112) 9) dialog: True sign of a good day.
112) 34) dialog: So. Keep in touch. E-mail, all that good stuff.
112) 38) dialog: If you're ever-- not that you would be-- ever in Oh-my-God, Nebraska...
112) 42) dialog: Yeah. Look me up.
