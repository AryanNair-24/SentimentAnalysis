24) 10) dialog: Baroo-baroo, let's get this party started you mother-rubbers!
24) 13) dialog: Ronald Wilkes! No fucking way! The Ronimal! Gimme some love-uh, my soul broth-uh!
24) 19) dialog: What's the matter, friend, never seen a chocolate-vanilla love sandwich?! Wait until later when we get to the buttfucking! Nah, I'm having fun. Dean Ziegler. Stevens Point, Wisconsin.
24) 22) dialog: Don't worry, I won't bite. I'm medicated. Not really. But I should be. Right Ronimal? So what's your handle pal? 27. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
24) 28) dialog: Call me Deanzie. Where you hail from, Tim Lippe? Quiet-land?
24) 33) dialog: Bill Krogstad's outfit. The Krogger! (beat, dials it way down) Aw shit. I was sorry as hell to hear about Lemke's passing up there. That guy was tits as a rep. Course he thought I was a big, loud asshole-- s'pose he wasn't too far off there. No boy, a real tragedy.
24) 38) dialog: Amen. He'll be in my prayers. His family, too. Tragedy.
24) 41) dialog: Well. I don't know about you wingnuts, but the Deanzie could use a drinkzie. What say we blow off the welcome hoo-ha and hit Horizons for happy hour. Two-for-one cocktails, 10 cent wings, and an all-you-care-to-eat pussy buffet!
24) 49) dialog: Oh, don't get me started on that smug fuck. Orin Helgesson is a-- pardon my French-- a cunt. Just a steaming wet dog cunt.
24) 54) dialog: Fine. Have fun ladies... Not.
24) 57) dialog: Party time. Excellent.
28) 63) dialog: How's she hanging Big Tim? Big time Big Tim...
28) 67) dialog: It's Deanzie, c'mon. (shouts at bartender) Ahoy Cap'n, we got a thirsty sailor over here!
28) 72) dialog: (re. the bartender) Kid was in the navy. Seaman.
28) 79) dialog: You want a nipple with that?
28) 83) dialog: Ach, I'm busting your balls. You don't get out much, do you buddy? (spots Tim's drink coupons) Whoa, who'd you have to blow to get all those?
28) 87) dialog: Smug fuck. Trying to poison my roommate with his B-S propaganda.
28) 91) dialog: (softens, fatherly) Wow-wow-wow, you are naГЇve. A rail cocktail's, what, four bucks? Times that by 10 drink coupons. We're talking 40 large, Tim. Doesn't sound so friendly anymore, does it? Sounds more like one of these I-scratch- your-back-you-scratch-mine deals. (off Tim's confused look) I bet ol' Orin invited you up to the Tiffany Suite, too, hmm? Fourth floor? View of the pool? Yup. (leans in, conspiratorial) Cocksucker's buying your vote, pal. 37. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
28) 96) dialog: Ronimal! Taco Bill! Over here!
28) 102) dialog: So Big Time Tim, what're you looking for pussy-wise here in Cedar CRAPids?
28) 107) dialog: That your mom?
28) 113) dialog: My moral compass is pointing true north, if you read me. Right Taco Bill?
28) 116) dialog: And by the way, Ronimal-- I was married. Was.
28) 120) dialog: (barely covering the pain) Ah, she's a fucking asshole.
28) 125) dialog: Together 17 years. Lucky if one of `em was decent. ASS. FUCKING. HOLE.
28) 128) dialog: What I was talking about anyway, Ronimal, is that from what I can deduce, young Timbo Lippe here has led a-- shall I say-- sheltered existence. And I think we oughta help him, y'know, aroo-aroo!
28) 141) dialog: The O-Fox!
28) 155) dialog: (does a bad Austin Powers) Oh yeah baby. Shag-a-licious!
28) 158) dialog: Tim, this is the Queen Bee of ASMI, Joan Ostrowski-Fox. The O-Fox.
28) 169) dialog: No she's not.
28) 174) dialog: Oh yeah, Jaeger time!
28) 199) dialog: (sings Hall &amp; Oates) Whoa-o here she comes-- she's a man eater!
31) 8) dialog: 
32) 5) dialog: You sound like my fuckin' wife, Timbo. Jesus. Ex, I should say. EX.
32) 10) dialog: Fuck yeah! (calms himself, whispers) Fuck yeah. But we didn't get to finish our little confab back at the bar. I figured some shit out.
32) 15) dialog: Like I told you, no shocker-- Helgesson's buttering you up to get you in his camp, because he knows you and me are close...
32) 19) dialog: Close enough. You're voting for me for President, right?
32) 23) dialog: Well anyway, there's a petition going around trying to take away your company's Two Diamond Awards.
32) 27) dialog: Well hear this: After you left the bar, Mike Pyle comes up to me-- Pyle of shit, I call him-- and he asks do I want to sign this thing. And I go, "Lemke might have been a class-A deviant, but the guy was tits as a rep..."
32) 31) dialog: Joyce who...? Oh, no-no-no, whoa- whoa-whoa, that old whore called ME. Harping about Lemke being a pervert and how she wants to take her business elsewhere. So I says, "OK, I'll run some numbers." Well, she calls back later that same day, says she got Krogstad to lower her premium. Which is all the greasy twat wanted in the first place.
32) 37) dialog: I may be a lot of things, but poacher ain't one of `em.
32) 42) dialog: Personally? I think Mike Pyle of Shit started the thing as a way to drive down the price of your agency. Dollars to donuts he wants to swoop in and pick up Northlands at a bargain basement price. And you know what else I think? I think Orin's in on the deal somehow.
32) 47) dialog: I can't quite figure it myself, but I know what I know. And what I know is you're wading into some duvious, er dubious, shit. Just be careful.
40) 3) dialog: I'm saying a Bridge to the 22nd Century is a stupid theme, Helgesson. Not a goddamn one of us is even going to be alive in the 22nd Century...
40) 9) dialog: Stab me in the fucking back why don't you, Wilkes...
40) 16) dialog: Timbo! Sorry about that gigantic boner I got while we were spooning.
40) 23) dialog: Pyle of shit.
40) 28) dialog: Smug fuck. (then, to Tim &amp; Ronald) So who's ready for a drink?
40) 32) dialog: 
42) 18) dialog: Timbo! Turn around!
42) 27) dialog: Come on bud, I was having fun.
46) 17) dialog: Let's roll, Perry-- Perry-plegic. Get it, like paraplegic? But...
49) 14) dialog: Know what that cow's thinking, Pyle? She's thinking, "quit pulling on my tits and fuck me already."
50) 40) dialog: I think I just shit my pants.
60) 20) dialog: Timbo and the O-Fox! Wondered when you crazy kids were gonna show up.
60) 34) dialog: You tag that yet, Timbo? Bet she's moist as a damp sponge, huh?
60) 38) dialog: Shit, what isn't wrong me? I drink too much, I weigh too much, I piss people off. Speaking of, that crank call earlier-- way outta line. People are right, I am an asshole.
60) 42) dialog: I love it! "I guess I've seen worse." I love it! (big laugh, then) Yeah shit, s'pose we all wish our lives had gone a little different. You don't come into this deal going, "Dear God, please let my wife toss me out on my ass. Please give my children the courage to hate my fucking guts. Thank you Jesus. Praise Jesus! Praise Jesus!" Ach, I'm just having fun. (crosses himself, looks
60) 58) dialog: Maybe you two should take one of those gay cruises together.
60) 67) dialog: Ha! I love it! Richard head!
60) 78) dialog: Would you rather toss a bum's salad, y'know, eat out his butthole or... give your dad a B-J?
60) 138) dialog: Check this out-- Captain Nemo!
61) 39) dialog: Hell yeah.
61) 47) dialog: Suck my ass, Helgesson.
64) 3) dialog: Come on, Ronimal! My key got wet. Wake up, man!
69) 14) dialog: You should have stuck around last night, Ronimal. Watching Timbo and the O-Fox get it on in the pool-- shit, I was harder than Chinese arithmetic.
71) 6) dialog: That time of the month? (off Tim's look) C'mon man, it's gonna be OK.
71) 10) dialog: C'mere, kiddo. Sit. Sit down. 83. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
71) 15) dialog: My ex, Patti? Well-established fact that this broad is a serious fucking cuntstain, right? But like I say, she's made it pretty much so the kids hate my guts-- I'm the bad guy. `Cept when our 17-year-old daughter comes home PREGNANT-- oh yeah, happy day in the Ziegler household, lemme tell ya-- who's the one so depressed that she can't get out from under the afghan on the goddamn couch? Patti. And who's the one planning the baby showers and taking Meg to the gyno, all that shit? The fucking Deanzie. That's who.
71) 20) dialog: I'm telling you this, buddy, because it shows to go ya-- even if you're a fucking waste of space jerk-off like myself, there's always opportunities to do the right thing. If this Two Diamond bullshit and that matters so much, you'll find a way to make it right. If not, fuck it. Life's way too short to lose sleep over shit that don't matter.
76) 5) dialog: Vote for Deanzie. Vote for change.
76) 9) dialog: Well fuck you very much, Carla.
76) 12) dialog: I can count on your vote tomorrow, right Ronimal?
76) 16) dialog: You're all a bunch of dicks.
83) 13) dialog: Are you ready for this? Mike Pyle of Shit just bought Northlands. Word is the cocksucker's liquidating Timbo and the whole Brown Valley operation.
83) 19) dialog: Cry me a fucking river, honey. This isn't about you for once.
83) 31) dialog: You two are a couple of serious fucking downers, man. Timbo left here in a huff a few hours ago-- you saw him Ronimal. Maybe he already knew. Shit, the kid's one of my best friends...
83) 35) dialog: Know what, blow me Ronald. It's not my fault you're too goddamn afraid to open up and tell another man you love him. Do what you want, but the Deanzie's gonna make sure his friend is doing OK.
85) 5) dialog: Trying to reach Tim Lippe. Who am I talking to?
85) 9) dialog: That right? Is he there now?
87) 5) dialog: Who's Ken?
93) 3) dialog: I'll be standing by `case things get squirrelly in there. Getaway vehicle type scenario. 99. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
96) 3) dialog: Mm-mow-mow... Two tickets to paradise. Hmm-hmm, pack your bags we'll leave tonight... 100. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
98) 3) dialog: Oh fuck!
99) 3) dialog: What the fuck happened?
99) 15) dialog: The Ronimal!
100) 5) dialog: Wasn't just Krogstad, Timbo. Orin's the real devil in this deal.
100) 20) dialog: Sleep good, little friend.
108) 16) dialog: Hey Travis, I don't think Tim...
108) 67) dialog: Fuck yeah Timbo!
108) 75) dialog: What's the fucking charge?
108) 82) dialog: What's this?
110) 5) dialog: "Butt ram!" I love it!
110) 8) dialog: Want your get out of jail free card back?
110) 12) dialog: When I saw it, at first I was like, shit am I supposed to take money out of the account, or what?
110) 16) dialog: Nah, it was more fun watching the smug fuck sweat. I told him I'd rat his pathetic ass out if he didn't drop the charges against you.
111) 8) dialog: (lacking his usual energy) I'll show you some real wood.
112) 11) dialog: Well, pal, it's been real.
112) 18) dialog: Listen, my cousin Bob-- guy made a truckload selling these little scented pine trees all the ragheads hang in their cabs? Fuckin' believe that? Anyhow, he's got a sweet cottage up on Lake of the Woods. Canada? I can use it whenever I want.
112) 23) dialog: I say we book it for June, before the mosquitoes go apeshit up there.
112) 31) dialog: Done.
116) 7) dialog: What was with the fuckin' unicorn?
116) 13) dialog: Jesus-- a retarded kid just sitting there yelling would've been better than you.
