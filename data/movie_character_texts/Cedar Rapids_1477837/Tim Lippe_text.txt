0) 19) dialog: (earnest, deeply admiring) Oh, heck yeah. You were awesome.
0) 22) dialog: Just super... super awesome. Man.
0) 26) dialog: Oh. Yeah. I say that, too... sometimes. 3. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
0) 32) dialog: Oh, no biggie...
0) 36) dialog: Ach. Y'know. Got left on the ol'...
0) 41) dialog: The ol' cutting room floor, right? (upon being ignored) Brad Pitt. Ha. That's... (then, with forced nonchalance) Whoa. Cake. Cool.
0) 44) dialog: So awesome.
6) 3) dialog: There she is! How you feeling?
6) 8) dialog: Ta-da. (re. the stuffed duck) Quack, quack. D'you already have this guy? Wasn't sure. 5. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
6) 18) dialog: I know. But for you to miss a day of school, Millie... I can't remember you ever calling in sick when I had you.
6) 22) dialog: Negative. Not to my knowledge. Not to my knowledge.
6) 25) dialog: So. Does your tummy feel good enough to...?
7) 6) dialog: I can try and... hold it, Mil. Can you...?
7) 11) dialog: I'm bringing it. Bringing it! Bringing it! D'aaaarrgho'awesome...
8) 3) dialog: Ooh, you make me live! You're my best friend!
8) 7) dialog: Sorry. But you are, babygirl.
8) 15) dialog: (mediocre Jamaican accent) Ya mon, Bahama-mama.
8) 24) dialog: 
8) 29) dialog: So? Roger and Gwen Lemke go to the Dells every year...
8) 33) dialog: Hello, Tommy Bartlett's Ski, Sky and Stage Show? It's not just a water park...
8) 37) dialog: What's so great about...? You're not... You're missing the... We agreed on the Dells.
8) 42) dialog: I'm living a perfectly fine life. I don't know why you'd want to...
8) 47) dialog: rock the waters or whatever. Ridiculous.
8) 50) dialog: We agreed on the Dells.
9) 3) dialog: Hello... Oh, hey Bill...
9) 6) dialog: Aw jeez. Oh my gosh. No...
10) 18) dialog: I'm... Gwen, I'm so sorry. Roger is-- was-- is-- a personal hero to me. He just... he had it all. If there's...
10) 21) dialog: I'm...
11) 8) dialog: Hang on guys, how's this sound-- you can both be right. (pause for effect) I know you're probably thinking, "Oh, an umbrella policy's only for rich people." You know what I say to that? Bull roar.
11) 13) dialog: Pam, Kurt-- I've known you guys since you were little kids. So let's don't think of me as an "insurance salesman." Think of me as your friend who just wants to help you protect your dreams...
11) 16) dialog: I'm... Excuse me a sec...
11) 19) dialog: D'you-- can I get you a napkin or something, Bill? For that?
11) 23) dialog: Um. I'm with Kurt and Pam Gambsky...
11) 27) dialog: Wait, Roger was going to buy Northlands?
11) 31) dialog: Holy cow. 11. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
11) 38) dialog: The... belt and the lederhosen...?
11) 42) dialog: Is there...? Can I do anything to help, or...?
11) 45) dialog: "Innovations in Hog Farm Risk Mitigation." Roger's Two Diamond presentation for the ASMI Convention. I helped prepare it.
11) 49) dialog: (not getting it) Mm.
11) 55) dialog: Whoa-whoa-wait. What are you saying?
11) 59) dialog: I can't go to ASMI. To Iowa. To Cedar Rapids, Iowa... Why can't Lila do it?
11) 63) dialog: Bill, I've never... I mean, I've dabbled in hog farm risk mitigation, but I'm no pro...
11) 69) dialog: Millie and I are getting married.
13) 8) dialog: Hey. Wade. Hey. Is Millie...?
13) 13) dialog: It's six AM...?
13) 17) dialog: Oh yeah. Those guys. Hilarious. Ha.
13) 21) dialog: (finally, to Millie) Well I just wanted to...
13) 24) dialog: Oh shoot. You already have a Strut the Rooster...
13) 31) dialog: It's only four days. 15. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
13) 37) dialog: 
13) 43) dialog: If I don't try to do this, it's not just my job, Mil. There are four other employees whose lives are on the line. Plus Carol, who does part time seasonal work. So.
13) 47) dialog: No, Bill said he'd make that part of any deal...
13) 55) dialog: It's... Oh, who am I kidding, I'm a little scared here. A lot scared. But not about us. What we've got-- we're like lightning in a bottle, babygirl. I love you so much, Mil.
13) 62) dialog: I know. I will. I mean, Cedar Rapids-- there were only four homicides last year. For a city of 122-thousand that's pretty darn good. The forcible rape numbers are admittedly a bit higher, but...
13) 67) dialog: I will every day. Twice a day.
13) 71) dialog: 
14) 5) dialog: Thanks! Just wanna be sure I make my flight. Going down to Cedar Rapids. The big ASMI Convention?
15) 5) dialog: Cold enough for you? I'm heading to Cedar Rapids. Supposed to be up in the mid-30s down there. S-weet!
15) 9) dialog: Whoa... what's all this now?
15) 16) dialog: Hey Bill, what's going on?
15) 24) dialog: Dean Ziegler, Stevens Point.
15) 33) dialog: Affirmative.
15) 36) dialog: On me at all times. Plus three back- up discs.
15) 41) dialog: Bill... I have to ask. Let's say one of these big dogs-- your Allstates, your Prudentials-- does decide to go and buy Northlands...?
16) 11) dialog: You're talking what, water landing? (looks around, whispers) Terror type deal? Terrorists...?
16) 15) dialog: Believe it or not, I have actually never been on an airplane before.
16) 19) dialog: (takes a moment) OK. If you need any help, I'm in.
16) 26) dialog: Tim Lippe.
16) 31) dialog: Great to meet you, Dave. Wondering, what kind of name is Marinakis?
16) 35) dialog: Marinakis. OK. Mine's German. Lippe.
16) 40) dialog: As in, "Don't you get lippy with me, mister." My grandma used to say that. Before she passed. Lot of people pronounce it lip. Course the high German's probably more like lipp-uh.
17) 3) dialog: Like I say, Dave, it's not life insurance so much as it is dream insurance.
17) 7) dialog: I think so.
17) 10) dialog: Let me know how things go with your Alltel deal, Dave. E-mail me.
18) 3) dialog: Hello. Score!
18) 8) dialog: Holy crap. Awesome.
19) 6) dialog: What's that now?
19) 10) dialog: Oh, I'm like, "this gal wants to borrow my heater?" Tss. But no, sorry, can't help you there.
19) 14) dialog: You bet. Tim Lippe. Northlands Insurance. How `bout yourself?
19) 19) dialog: Well Bree, it's nice to meet you. But let me give you a trade secret.
19) 29) dialog: You bet. Party hearty. Nice chatting with you, Bree.
20) 5) dialog: You tell me. Never done the hotel deal before.
20) 9) dialog: (reads the name tag) Trent, I was given the impression that you honored traveler's checks.
20) 13) dialog: Traveler's check is a fully insured method of, y'know. 100 percent.
20) 17) dialog: I'm a non-drinker.
21) 5) dialog: Not yet, but I can smell it. The chlorine. It's a super top-notch place, Mil. You'd be blown away. Oop, 321. I'm at mi casa. Just a... lemme see how this deal works.
21) 8) dialog: Key's like a stinkin' credit card.
21) 13) dialog: (to the man) Oh jeez. I'm sorry. I'm... Please. (turns, whispers into phone) There's an Afro-American gentleman in this room.
21) 30) dialog: 
21) 36) dialog: Um. Yeah. Yes. You bet. For a minute there I was like, whoa, I'm gonna be robbed here, or...
21) 39) dialog: It's super... just super great to meet you, Ronald.
22) 3) dialog: Check out these digs. Huzzah!
22) 13) dialog: No. I'm down. Down with that. Heck yeah. Any idea who we're gonna be chilling with, roommate-wise?
22) 17) dialog: 
24) 7) dialog: Ha. N-T-S. That's hilarious. I'd love to own my own agency...
24) 30) dialog: No. I do not. I'm down from Brown Valley, Wisconsin.
24) 35) dialog: 
24) 45) dialog: I'm planning to watch President Helgesson's opening remarks. 28. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
25) 19) dialog: 
25) 28) dialog: Did he say over 15 agencies?
25) 32) dialog: You're competing? 30. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
26) 3) dialog: I need to talk to you, Mil. I'm in over my head here. I feel like I can't even swim. It was fun at first, but now it's like, I dunno. I need you so bad, babygirl...
26) 8) dialog: Who's...? Wade?
26) 14) dialog: Are...? You're at Millie's still?
26) 19) dialog: Um. Yes, please. And just, would you tell her I love her very much.
27) 9) dialog: I... Ma'am, no. I'm sorry if you... I wouldn't... I have a fiancГ©!
27) 13) dialog: No, no, no, please. I didn't...
27) 20) dialog: Ha. OK. That was different. Ha. Yes. Yes you are. A real... jerkhead.
27) 25) dialog: Tim Lippe.
27) 32) dialog: No I don't. I'm actually in town for the ASMI convention.
27) 36) dialog: No, it's an association of insur... Oh. You're screwing with me again.
27) 40) dialog: Um. 33. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
28) 5) dialog: Oh. I... OK.
28) 10) dialog: You bet. Very much, sir.
28) 14) dialog: Tim Lippe. Down from Brown Valley, Wisconsin. Northlands Insurance?
28) 22) dialog: Um, well, it's rough. Real rough. Like you said in your remarks, Roger wasn't just a great rep, he was a good father and...
28) 26) dialog: Yeah. It's just rough.
28) 31) dialog: Thank you.
28) 36) dialog: Yeah, it sounds pretty top-notch.
28) 40) dialog: What?!
28) 52) dialog: Thank you President Helgesson.
28) 65) dialog: Hello Dean.
28) 77) dialog: Ah. Do you guys have root beer?
28) 81) dialog: Ah, why would I need a nipple...?
28) 85) dialog: I didn't... Nobody. President Helgesson gave them to me.
28) 89) dialog: I really don't... Orin, President Helgesson, he wanted to help me meet people. Just being friendly.
28) 104) dialog: Ah, that would be nothing...
28) 109) dialog: No. No it is not. Millie and I are engaged. To be married.
28) 133) dialog: Exactly. And P-S, I would never, ever have "relations" or whatever with another woman.
28) 161) dialog: Hey. Ha. From the fitness center.
28) 180) dialog: Oh, I don't, ah...
28) 185) dialog: Ah... Grenadine? Please.
28) 196) dialog: It's been a super long day. I, ah, better... Good night...
28) 202) dialog: Hello Bree.
30) 3) dialog: Wade.
30) 7) dialog: Oh. Tell him hey.
30) 14) dialog: I have to do some work before bed, so...
30) 19) dialog: No, it's-- I love you so bad, babygirl. It's so hard here. I just miss you.
30) 23) dialog: Tss. Yeah, yeah. Keep reminding me.
30) 27) dialog: OK. You, too. I love you. 42. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
31) 3) dialog: Current risk mitigation mechanisms available to hog farm operations include futures and options to...
31) 6) dialog: I'm in here!
32) 3) dialog: What the heck is going on here?
32) 8) dialog: Are you drunk?
32) 17) dialog: We're not close...
32) 21) dialog: No I'm not.
32) 25) dialog: I know. I heard.
32) 29) dialog: Pardon my French, Dean, but that's a bunch of bull roar. My boss, Bill Krogstad? He told me how you called up Joyce ArmbrГјster and smeared Roger's name all over town...
32) 33) dialog: So wait, you didn't call her? 44. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
32) 40) dialog: So what's with this petition?
32) 45) dialog: What? That's impossible.
33) 8) dialog: Hmm...? Oh. Yeah.
33) 12) dialog: Hello, thank you. I feel like my head is gonna like... (makes explosion face) Y'know?
33) 17) dialog: Excuse me, Ronald. It's my boss.
35) 3) dialog: Bill, I... That Dean Ziegler-- he was trying to warn me about Orin.
35) 7) dialog: Bill, I'm sorry...
37) 3) dialog: I didn't know I did anything wrong.
38) 10) dialog: Mm, I don't know. Only everything.
39) 3) dialog: He didn't have to yell at me. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm trying my hardest.
39) 7) dialog: Could you?
39) 12) dialog: You are freaky. (laughs, then) No, it's kind of weird how I got interested in insurance, actually. When I was six, my dad got killed in a sawmill accident.
39) 18) dialog: Yeah. Not good. But after he died, our insurance agent fought like a tiger against the sawmill to make sure me and my mom were taken care of. And we were.
39) 23) dialog: He had just opened Northlands. Anyway, I remember thinking, this guy's a hero. A real hero. So even if he doesn't always treat me, like y'know... whatever now-- I'll never forget that.
39) 26) dialog: This river-- the Cedar River? It flooded the whole city a couple years ago.
39) 30) dialog: People talk about the firemen and policemen and that. But think about all the claims in a disaster like that-- how hard those agents worked to make sure people's lives weren't left in the lurch. We're talking billions of dollars in damages, literally. And claim by claim, dream by dream, those agents helped rebuild this city. I'm telling you, it's a noble calling. I really believe that.
39) 34) dialog: Tss. I wish. 50. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
39) 40) dialog: Well, even if you're being full of it, thanks for saying that anyway.
40) 19) dialog: We didn't spoon, Orin...
40) 35) dialog: You need to leave me alone.
42) 3) dialog: Hello.
42) 8) dialog: Millie? Something happened...?
42) 24) dialog: What the H did I ever do to you, you a-hole.
43) 3) dialog: I just wanted to hear your voice.
43) 7) dialog: Nothing. Nothing really...
43) 13) dialog: Oh.
44) 3) dialog: I'd like to sign up for the scavenger hunt.
44) 7) dialog: Eastern Iowa's largest two-story mall. I know. Sweet. (a thought, a moment) And yes, I do have a teammate.
45) 9) dialog: Oh, nothing. Say Joan, you have something on your blouse.
45) 12) dialog: Burn.
45) 17) dialog: (bad Elvis impersonation) Thank you. Thank you very much.
45) 22) dialog: Uh, well I... Because Ronald already had a teammate...
45) 28) dialog: ... And I thought you'd-- we'd-- be y'know, a decent team. So... (then, firm) I think you should do it.
46) 5) dialog: 
46) 14) dialog: You're going down, a-hole.
47) 5) dialog: Check it out-- Planet X!
47) 8) dialog: I compiled a ton of info on Cedar Rapids. I've got a sweet laminator in my basement.
47) 12) dialog: (flips through his packet) ... Maps, area attractions, crime stats, local customs...
47) 16) dialog: Bingo! Right here-- Planet X Family Fun Center. Let's go. Act natural.
48) 3) dialog: OK, I think we're going to want to take Blair's Ferry Road to Avenue C, then probably east on 100.
48) 7) dialog: I memorized the major thoroughfares and landmarks in the metro area.
49) 4) dialog: 
49) 20) dialog: No, you're doing great, Joan. And you look super awesome with a wiener in your mouth. 59. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
49) 26) dialog: No. (giggles, with pride) Maybe.
50) 9) dialog: No, it's actually a big thing in Iowa. ABC news did a story about it. I saw it on YouTube.
50) 13) dialog: Uh-uh, absolutely not. I'm scared crapless of heights.
50) 23) dialog: Yeah. Let's do this thing.
50) 28) dialog: Hang on... How's it...?
50) 36) dialog: Ugh. This is frickin' hard.
50) 53) dialog: Wait, we won?
51) 3) dialog: Oh crap. I forgot...
51) 8) dialog: I'm sorry, Mil. I signed up for this scavenger hunt, and check it out-- we won! My teammate and I, that is. Joan.
51) 14) dialog: That was Joan saying hi. (beat, to Joan) Millie says hi.
51) 24) dialog: OK. Sounds good.
53) 3) dialog: Just some gal from Omaha they paired me up with. Between you and me, she's a little different. Real hyper-- one of these types who kind of overdoes it. But for a 75 dollar gift card, I'm not going to complain. 63. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
53) 9) dialog: 
56) 3) dialog: Hey. What say we just use the gift certificate to get a nice supper here? At the mall. 64. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
57) 3) dialog: We have a gift card. But I didn't make a reservation. Is that OK?
58) 6) dialog: Nice. Thanks.
58) 9) dialog: To victory. To new friends. To life. And all the joys of living it.
58) 14) dialog: Mm, it does taste a lot like communion wine. Awesome. 65. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
58) 23) dialog: Mine? Let's see. Um. I would love-- some day-- to put a little greenhouse in my backyard.
58) 27) dialog: No, I've actually seen some fairly decent portable ones at Fleet Farm that won't break the bank...
58) 32) dialog: Well. I always hoped I could take over Northlands when Bill retired. But that obviously isn't going to happen now.
58) 36) dialog: Yeah right.
58) 40) dialog: I don't... Probably not.
58) 46) dialog: Grrrr. Ha. Time out. Sheesh. Let's.
58) 51) dialog: You've got kids?
58) 56) dialog: Awesome. Beautiful kids. And that's...?
58) 60) dialog: Norway.
58) 64) dialog: Wow.
59) 3) dialog: OK. I thought of another one.
59) 7) dialog: Wish. Or dream or whatever. It's still small potatoes compared to...
59) 11) dialog: ... to all you've done-- Norway and all that, but...
59) 16) dialog: No-no-no. Negative! Sheesh. But I do enjoy watching it quite a bit. Randy's always like, "That's awesome, dawg!" And Simon's such a-- (mediocre British accent) "Oh, I'm so superior."
60) 5) dialog: Oh no, I have to practice my Two Diamond presentation. I can't...
60) 10) dialog: Ha. Nightcap. Kneecap, more like...
60) 14) dialog: Yes.
60) 27) dialog: Actually, do they have cream sherry?
60) 36) dialog: She is MARRIED. And you're just... What is wrong with you?
60) 40) dialog: Well. Yeah. You kind of are. But I guess I've seen worse.
60) 48) dialog: Ronald! Hello. (takes his drink) Thanks mucho... So Ronald, what's your situation? You married, or...?
60) 52) dialog: Wow.
60) 56) dialog: I never use my vacation time.
60) 65) dialog: (titters as he figures it out) Dick head. Yeah Dean, you are a total Richard!
60) 82) dialog: No, if you used some salad dressing a bum's a-hole might not taste that bad. Thousand Island!
60) 89) dialog: Did he just...?
60) 93) dialog: No, no, no, no, no...
60) 104) dialog: I, um, I've met some really, just super neat people here. But this song, I'd like to dedicate to the first African-American person I've ever met. I mean, I've seen guys at the Oneida Mall in Rhinelander-- said hello and that. But... Anyway, I just think you're one of the most awesome guys around. Ronald Wilkes!
60) 107) dialog: (reading off the screen) I was born and raised down in Alabama. On a farm way back up in the woods. I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches. Papa used to tease me about it. But deep down inside he was hurt, 'cause he'd done all he could.
60) 110) dialog: (breaks into song, very soulful) My papa was a great old man. I can see him with a shovel in his hands. See education he never had; He did wonders when the times got bad. The little money from the crops he raised barely paid the bills we made.
60) 132) dialog: Uh-oh. Who is it then?
60) 141) dialog: 
60) 147) dialog: No frickin' way!
61) 5) dialog: 
61) 12) dialog: Yow. Chilly. Ha.
61) 17) dialog: Yep. Ha. Fun. Fun day.
61) 22) dialog: Oh jeez. 75. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
61) 27) dialog: You have tan. A tan. Tan line. You have a.
61) 30) dialog: You. Are. You're. Married.
61) 33) dialog: I have a fian...
61) 36) dialog: Oh jeez...
63) 3) dialog: Holy crap! We're so dead!
63) 6) dialog: I want to make love!
65) 3) dialog: Your body's just so... firm and pretty. Mmm. Making love to you was just super... super awesome.
65) 6) dialog: Wanna cuddle?
65) 12) dialog: I love to cuddle.
66) 14) dialog: Good morning. 78. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
66) 20) dialog: No problemo.
66) 23) dialog: Is that...? Were you looking at my Two Diamond presentation?
66) 27) dialog: Um. Thanks. It was Roger Lemke's...
66) 32) dialog: What? Whaddaya...? You and... You and Roger, you mean?
66) 39) dialog: My foot I knew! No, I did not. And yes, it most certainly does matter. Man, this T's me off. 79. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
66) 45) dialog: Every stinkin' place I go people remind me: You're no Roger Lemke. You're not as good as Roger Lemke. Here we go again.
66) 50) dialog: Why were you with him then?
66) 55) dialog: Hey, hey. Come on. You're pretty and smart and just super awesome.
66) 59) dialog: Grrr. I'm so frickin' confused. Last thing I thought was that I'd come to Cedar Rapids and fall in love.
66) 64) dialog: Us. This.
66) 70) dialog: What about...?
66) 75) dialog: Where the heck are my clothes?
66) 79) dialog: Yeah. Well, you're acting like a fricking... prostitute.
67) 3) dialog: I lost my slacks somewhere.
69) 5) dialog: I'm really, really sorry Ronald. If I said anything, or...
69) 9) dialog: No, I'm not. I...
71) 3) dialog: Goddarnit!
71) 8) dialog: No it's not. Nothing is OK. My job, my fiancГ©... (dawns on him) God, I'm a philanderer. I've let Bill down. I've let everybody down.
71) 18) dialog: Is this...? Why is this all of a sudden about you, Dean?
73) 3) dialog: President Helgesson, please let me stay in the Two Diamond contest. Please. This isn't for me-- it's for Bill Krogstad. I can't let him down. Please just let me compete.
75) 8) dialog: Ah, no. Thanks.
75) 13) dialog: This is the petition?
75) 23) dialog: Oh my gosh, really? Thank you.
75) 28) dialog: PayPal? Um, yeah. I've used it to pay for Beanie Babies on E-Bay...
75) 33) dialog: I don't understand what you mean...
75) 42) dialog: You bet.
75) 46) dialog: I can't say that I do...
75) 50) dialog: You're an awesome President...
75) 57) dialog: I'm still not reading you here...
75) 63) dialog: Do you literally mean you just need help, like, getting on-line, or...?
75) 67) dialog: You're talking about stealing.
75) 72) dialog: I'd be doing it for Northlands-- to keep it in Brown Valley and help my co-workers. To help Bill...
75) 75) dialog: What would you need me to do exactly...?
76) 21) dialog: Um. I... I don't know about that.
76) 25) dialog: I'm sorry about... Ronald. Just... about everything...
78) 5) dialog: A large cream sherry, please.
78) 11) dialog: 
78) 15) dialog: Another please. I have to use the little boy's room.
79) 4) dialog: Bree? (off her confused look) It's Tim Lippe. From the ASMI convention. We met out in front of the Holidome across the street?
79) 9) dialog: That's what you get from smoking all those-- what'd you call `em, heaters? Smoker's cough. Ha. Just kidding. Butterscotch?
79) 12) dialog: Small world, huh?
79) 16) dialog: Ooh, that's really awesome of you to ask. But I have a super important presentation in the morning unfortunately, so...
79) 21) dialog: Yeah. I hear that. L &amp; C. Loud and... clear.
79) 29) dialog: I have had a pretty messed up day actually. Might not hurt to forget about it for a little while. 91. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
84) 3) dialog: That must be pretty all right, Ken, getting half off at Applebee's all the time. I'd only weigh like 10- thousand pounds...
84) 8) dialog: Ah...? This would be marijuana, I'm guessing?
84) 16) dialog: Oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez.
86) 4) dialog: 
86) 13) dialog: 
86) 22) dialog: (not sure he heard right)
88) 5) dialog: My mom became real protective of me after my dad passed. She didn't really let me play sports or any of that. Fact, if I think about it, I never really did much of anything. Except gardening, which I do enjoy.
88) 13) dialog: Thanks. It's funny, though, because my job is all about protecting other people's dreams. But what about my dreams?
97) 10) dialog: 
99) 7) dialog: 
100) 3) dialog: I can't believe Bill would do this to me. He was like a father...
100) 13) dialog: I love you, Joan.
100) 23) dialog: I didn't make love to Bree, Joan.
104) 3) dialog: Sweet love showin' us a heavenly light. I never seen such a beautiful sight! See love glowin' on us every night, I know forever we'll be doin' it right!
105) 3) dialog: I always wanna call you "friend!" Sweet love showin' us a heavenly...
105) 8) dialog: Careful. It's super slippery.
105) 11) dialog: Whoop. Careful now. 105. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
105) 18) dialog: I did a ton of research on hog farm risk mitigation. Don't worry-- they might bite you a little if they think you're a food source. But there's never been a recorded hog- bite death. So...
105) 21) dialog: The Two Diamonds may be meaningless to you and Bill. But there are people who care about this stuff. Ronald Wilkes. Even Dean. Honest, good people. I'll come back for you after the Two Diamonds have been handed out to a legitimate winner. I'm really sorry about this, Orin, but the insurance industry deserves better than you.
107) 3) dialog: Well, I think everything's OK. Hope it is anyway. Listen Kurt, here's why I'm calling...
108) 20) dialog: 
108) 24) dialog: Smooth move, Ex-Lax. (a few chuckles) So, Hog... No. I, ah... this girl I met, sorry woman, I guess. She's 23. She takes drugs, and I think might be some kind of prostitute. (a collective gasp) But she's super insightful. Y'know what she said to me last night? Said the only real insurance is love. That's fricking INTENSE, isn't it...?
108) 27) dialog: I'm... ah... Our only true safety net. Love. Crazy. I believe in insurance. I believe in love...
108) 30) dialog: Bill! Bill Krogstad. My former boss, everybody. 108. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09
108) 37) dialog: Why'd you do this, Bill? I don't understand.
108) 40) dialog: Why'd you do it, Bill? Why'd you do it? Why'd you lie, Bill?
108) 45) dialog: Insurance isn't just a business, Bill. Insurance is personal. I've got some savings. I could've gotten a loan. We could've worked something out.
108) 51) dialog: Screw you, Bill. Screw you... hard.
108) 57) dialog: I care about them. And guess what, they care about me. Fact, I've called more than half of them already this morning...
108) 61) dialog: I knew which ones would be on their way to church, which ones I'd be waking up, which ones probably got a little blotto last night and might be hung over... And every single person I talked to-- every one-- is staying with me.
108) 65) dialog: I do actually. I do know, Bill. And before the day is out, I'll have called all my clients. All of them. (to Mike Pyle) So hey, congratulations Pyle of Shit-- you just bought a company that's losing half its business.
108) 77) dialog: Here.
108) 84) dialog: You'll figure it out.
109) 3) dialog: I know what you're thinking-- thinking "this wiseacre's full of baloney." Am I right?
109) 6) dialog: But I'm telling you Reginald, you're actually a perfect candidate for term life...
109) 16) dialog: I'm serious. Call any time-- on the mobile or home phone, though. The office number's no good anymore.
110) 3) dialog: Don't even say it, Deanzie-- no one butt rammed me or whatever in there.
110) 10) dialog: Not particularly.
110) 14) dialog: Did you?
110) 18) dialog: (a genuine smile) Sweet.
112) 3) dialog: Well.
112) 7) dialog: Tss. Ruined it more like.
112) 13) dialog: 
112) 27) dialog: I think it sounds awesome.
112) 36) dialog: You bet. You bet. You too.
112) 40) dialog: Yeah. Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. I used to watch that. Would be cool some day to see.
112) 44) dialog: So.
113) 4) dialog: So, did you do anything fun in Cedar Rapids...?
114) 4) dialog: How's the walleye?
114) 8) dialog: Meatloaf's on the dry side.
114) 13) dialog: What's...?
115) 6) dialog: How ya doin' there, Leslie?
115) 13) dialog: No, you probably won't.
115) 18) dialog: I'm trying...
