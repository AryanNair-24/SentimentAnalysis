When you read a book as a  child it becomes part of your identity  in a way that no other reading in  your life does. (stops herself)

125) 22) dialog: I just had a breakthrough, and I  have to thank you for it.  For the  first time in my life, when confronted  with a horrible, insensitive person  I actually knew what I wanted to say  and I said it.

125) 32) dialog: Please leave.  I beg you. He stands up, walks from the table, sits down at the very next table, with his back to her. The door to the restaurant opens.  Kathleen looks at it  hopefully.  A pleasant looking man, who's immediately joi by a pleasant looking woman. For a moment, Kathleen looks just a little droopy, as if wind has just gone out of her sails.  She takes out her  compact, looks into her mirror.

Don't they know  you're supposed to have last names?   It's like they're a whole generation  of cocktail waitresses. She stops herself -- it's a tangent she never meant to go off on.  But Joe has stood up and seated himself back at table.
125) 44) dialog: That's not what I meant --
125) 46) dialog: Oh, you poor sad multimillionaire.   I feel so sorry for you. The door opens and a large and very attractive TRANSVESTI in a boa comes in the door.
125) 50) dialog: No, I won't.  Because the man who's  coming here tonight is completely  unlike you.  The man who is coming  here is kind and funny -- he has the  most wonderful sense of humor --
125) 52) dialog: If he's not here, he has a reason,  because there is not a cruel or  careless bone in his body.  I can't  expect you to know anything about a  person like that.  You've nothing  but a suit. A beat.  Joe gets up.

132) 1) dialog: And as I waited, someone else showed  up, a man who has made my professional  life a misery, and an amazing thing  happened -- I was able, for the first  time in my life, to say the exact  thing I wanted to say it.  And of  course, afterwards, I felt terrible.   Just as you said I would.

No matter what  he's done to me, there's no excuse  for my behavior.  Anyway, you are my  dear friend, and I so wanted to talk  to you.  I hope you have a good reason  for not being there last night, but  if you don't, and if we never really  connect again, I just want to tell  you how much it has meant to me to  know you were there. Joe sits there a second.  A moment of intense ambivalence Then he hits the Menu key and signs off.
