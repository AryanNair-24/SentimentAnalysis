191) 3) dialog: This guy on Amsterdam who repairs  zippers.  You'll never have to buy  new luggage.
191) 5) dialog: Timing is everything.  He waited  until you were primed.  Until you  knew there was no other man you could  ever love.
191) 8) dialog: Sometimes I wonder...
191) 10) dialog: If I hadn't been Foxbooks and you  hadn't been The Shop Around the Corner  and we'd just met --

191) 28) dialog: Oh how I wish you would. It's all Kathleen can do not to forgive him. It's all Joe can do not to kiss her.
191) 30) dialog: You don't want to be late. She's in agony. He turns and walks away. After a moment, she does too.
195) 4) dialog: And she starts to cry. And he comes to her.  And puts his arms around her.
