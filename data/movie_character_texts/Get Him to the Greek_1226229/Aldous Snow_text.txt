50) 35) dialog: It’s beautiful, isn’t it? Aaron looks at it and starts to calm down. Aldous SNORTS
50) 37) dialog: To distract you. And impress you.

52) 6) dialog: It’s in remission.
52) 8) dialog: You're right. I lied. Like the way you lied about doing drugs.
52) 10) dialog: That’s not drugs.
52) 12) dialog: (then) I don’t understand you. Why’d you stop having sex with that girl? She was proper smoking.
52) 14) dialog: I just don’t get that.
52) 16) dialog: Why are you in a relationship? What is the advantage of it?
52) 18) dialog: You're fascinating. What do you do? Like at night?
52) 20) dialog: Is that with that guy, McDreamy?
52) 22) dialog: I know him. I fucked him.
52) 24) dialog: I was in a bad way. I'd just broken up with Kelly Osborne. I know that bloke. We had sex. (awkward silence) What do you do for your birthday? This is just fascinating. I’ve never met anyone like you.
52) 26) dialog: Me and about ninety-five people went to Richard Branson’s private island and had an ecstasy party and then went out in a hot air balloon.
52) 28) dialog: But it’s missing love, Aaron. Don’t you see? I want love the way you have love. Without love, I’m gonna become that bastard we just spent twelve hours with. I want a lady to pick out my clothes. And not just an assistant who I pay.
52) 31) dialog: I’m in love with Jackie Q. I know it now. She’s so gorgeous and sexy and has these perfect tits. Really, something. Like an angel's tits. And she always kept me guessing. I was with her at this party in Monaco and she leans over and whispers to me “I’m wet.” She just said that to me, you know, like she was telling me the weather, with McCartney and Judi Dench and the Dalai Lama just standing like two feet away. I swear I fell in love right then, right there. Then later that week, we're at a nightclub in Goa and she went and made out with Emma Bunton right in front of me. Under different circumstances I would have been happy to be seeing this, this would have been my idea of nirvana. But not this time. This time I was mad. And as I watched them make out and strip and begin the process of engaging in oral sex I got angrier and angrier till I realized this was love, I was in love.
52) 32) dialog: We have a kid together, you know. I haven't seen the tyke in years. Beautiful child.
52) 34) dialog: It is, isn’t it? I even pay his child support but I don’t mind cause I love him so much. And her too.
52) 36) dialog: I don’t know. I just don’t. I want her back. She lives in LA and I want to see her and get her back. But I don’t know what to do. Like when I first see her, what do I do?
52) 38) dialog: (turning dark) You're right, if I’m honest I'11l get her. And once I’ve gotten her I can finally put an end to this interminable, miserable single life. Presently I can go wherever I want with whoever I want and do whatever I want to whomever I want. It’s not as good as eating dinner at 6:30 with the same person and having nothing new to talk about ever. It’s like when I was on Branson’s private island in an ecstasy orgy with these two Indian models I was like “I wish I was locked in a small apartment in Los Angeles with the same person forever.” Aaron’s unsure whether to be offended or laugh it off.
52) 39) dialog: I’m just joshing with you, man. I'm jealous.
52) 41) dialog: It seems my compatriot has fallen out of the vehicle. The Limo Driver looks in the rear window and SCREECHES to side of the highway.

58) 13) dialog: Are you a monster? Are you a little monster?
58) 15) dialog: What was that? I think you just said you're a monster!
58) 17) dialog: No. Cause I’m the monster! Aldous stalks after Naples like a monster.
58) 19) dialog: And I love you!
58) 23) dialog: Well I don’t want to be a rotten egg! Naples jumps into the pool. Aldous strips and jumps in af him. Jackie watches from the side and laughs.

58) 26) dialog: I’m not a rotten egg. I’m the monster! Aldous takes Naples and throws him farther into the pool. Naples is giggling. Jackie is giggling. Aldous looks around. Life is perfect. +e HF FF
58) 31) dialog: Let’s do it. You love me, I love you. Wouldn’t you love that Naples?
58) 33) dialog: Let’s just go get married. We already have bundled our genes into this perfect little moppet. Let’s stop lying to ourselves and tie the knot already.
58) 35) dialog: Screw Paul Allen. Unengage him. Screw our little boxes that we've put our lives in.
58) 37) dialog: Relationships are about honesty and I am finally ready to be honest with you and Naples.
58) 43) dialog: But you just told me you loved me.
58) 45) dialog: That was like twenty minutes ago.
58) 48) dialog: Don’t take him away, lady! Don’t take my son away!
58) 51) dialog: That’s gonna change right now! I love him! A son should be raised by his father!
58) 53) dialog: What? No. Me. He’s half me.
58) 57) dialog: I don’t care if he’s not my son! I still love him! I LOVE YOU, KID!

AARON AND DAPHNE’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER Aaron, Daphne and Aldous are sitting in the living room. They're drinking wine. Aldous stares at the sculpture fro the beginning that Aaron described as “pretty.”
59) 10) dialog: I love this piece.
59) 12) dialog: But I also hate it. It looks the way my insides feel, all fucked up and tossed around. It’s like nausea in three dimensions.
59) 16) dialog: I want nothing more than to be right here in your apartment. Aaron downs his glass of wine. 99.
59) 17) dialog: (looking at a photo) Where’s this?
59) 19) dialog: The presidential suite at the Buenos Aires Ritz is the nicest hotel room I’ve ever been to.
59) 21) dialog: Well, next time check it out. Also, Argentinean prostitutes are out of this world. Aaron's about to cover but Daphne giggles in an oddly flirtatious way. QUICK CUTS OF THEM DRINKING AND LAUGHING TOGETHER while A looks more and more uncomfortable. Aldous plays and sings John Mayer’s “Daughters” on a guit while Daphne and Aaron watch, holding hands.
59) 23) dialog: I am astonished and fascinated at your longevity as a couple.
59) 26) dialog: What do you do when you’re ina relationship for that long. Like, how do you keep it lively?
59) 28) dialog: Aren’t you worried that you’re missing out?
59) 31) dialog: Like if you could have done one sexual activity before you died what would have been?
59) 33) dialog: Sure like that.
59) 35) dialog: Threesome. Do you have any fantasies like that?
59) 38) dialog: Well that is something that is possible right now. It’s not like wanting to fly or shoot lasers out of your eyes. A threesome is something that we can accomplish right here right now.
59) 41) dialog: If you’d like, but I certainly don’t want to apply any pressure. I have had my share of threesomes.
59) 47) dialog: I got this mate who I had a threesome with and he didn’t like it and then he never had one again. Daphne looks at Aaron like “see?”

60) 3) dialog: I am ejaculating! Ahhhhhh! INT. AARON AND DAPHNE’S APARTMENT Aaron rushes back into the bathroom. Aldous is somehow having sex with Daphne’s face. Or at least that’s what we have to assume. All the drive drops out of Aaron.
60) 6) dialog: Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! I am going to ejaculate again! Aldous pulls out and ejaculates. We don’t see it. We just see Aaron’s face change.
60) 8) dialog: What’s the problem?
60) 10) dialog: I didn’t mean to. That was an unintentional sperming.
60) 12) dialog: I am starving. I understand there’s a delicious diner around the corner. You interested, mate? 104.
60) 17) dialog: I don’t think it’s cheating when it’s a consensual threesome.
60) 20) dialog: You could have jumped in. We weren’t being exclusionary. That’s against the rules.
60) 26) dialog: Sexual mores are just a thing of the past century. We are all living in a false construct.
60) 35) dialog: I forgot my satchel.
60) 37) dialog: Woh. Alright, mate. Let’s just hand them over.
60) 39) dialog: Ow! Aaron throws a third and fourth and fifth. They land in Aldous’s leg, chest and right below his eye.

60) 47) dialog: I'm sorry if I’ve been a disappointment. I hope to one day make it up to you.
60) 52) dialog: Dear Aaron. This is my last will and testament. Since I have no kids or wife or really anything I’m leaving my estate to you. If you want to see me off, I’1l be jumping from the Hollywood sign at nine, depending on traffic. I want my body to be cryogenically frozen, to be unfrozen when there’s a chemical cure for addiction or heroin becomes legal, whichever comes first. Yours, Aldous. P.S. I’m sorry for making love to your girlfriend. That was done out of self-anger. P.P.S. I do not know if this last will and testament will hold up in a court of law. I apologize if it doesn’t. In fact, the more I think about it the more unlikely it seems that it will. Sorry, mate. Aaron takes a beat.
64) 5) dialog: Why not? I’ve got nothing. I'ma drug addicted nothing. My friends are all addicts or yes men. I can’t even write music anymore. I’m not even sure if I even ever could. Most of my songs are just ripoffs of the Beatles and the Clash. I’m the nugget of shit that hangs off the asshair of humanity.
64) 7) dialog: Sex isn’t love. Sex has gotten boring. (MORE)
64) 9) dialog: All I live for is getting high. If I don’t die from this I'll die from an overdose. At least if I jump I’m making the choice, not the drink and the drugs.
64) 11) dialog: I didn’t know you were religious.
64) 13) dialog: Why’re you doing this? Do you love me?
64) 15) dialog: Tell me you love me.
64) 17) dialog: Tell me that you love me and me specifically, not just the general concept of humanity. Beat. Aldous moves to the edge of the “H.” 113.
64) 19) dialog: I love you too, Aaron Greenberg. I love you too. Aldous, taking an intentional Christ like pose, JUMPS off “H” and hits the dusty desert below with a resounding and sickening thud. He rolls down the hill.

66) 6) dialog: I’m alive. I’m alive! I can’t believe I’m alive! You saved me, Aaron. I can’t believe you came and saved me.
66) 8) dialog: I have completely changed as a result of the love you've given me by saving me.
66) 10) dialog: (starting to cry) I look at you, Aaron, and I see pure love. You are the most beautiful person I have ever met.
66) 12) dialog: I am going to prove you wrong. That’s how I feel about you. Because we are going to be best friends forever.
66) 14) dialog: We can still make it. 115.
66) 16) dialog: I’m always at least four hours late. My fans all know this. Once, in Manchester, I went on at 2:10AM. Performed for six hours. We can still make it. (as they start to get out of the tub) My arm hurts. Aaron looks at Aldous’s arm. The bone’s sticking through. Aaron THROWS UP on Aldous. INT. AARON’S CAR Aaron's frantically driving Aldous.

66) 20) dialog: There is literally no way I can save your job right now without fourteen Vicodin. My bone is sticking out here. Touch it. That’s bone.
66) 22) dialog: It’s so weird. You can’t feel your bone if you touch it. It’s like touching a drumstick or something. Aaron gags.

68) 11) dialog: Get on out here, Aaron Greenberg! Get on out here, Aaron Greenberg! The crowd starts chanting this as well.
68) 15) dialog: This man, while he didn’t save me from jumping off the Hollywood sign, at least showed up. Even after I made love to his girlfriend. Now that’s true friendship. The crowd doesn’t know how to respond to this.
68) 16) dialog: I also wish to make an announcement. I’m quitting drugs and the alcohol. The audience starts booing. 117.
68) 19) dialog: If anyone ever sees me drinking a beer or smoking a joint or doing any other kind of controlled substance you have my legal permission to beat the living shit out of me. The crowd cheers like crazy.

Aldous begins jumping up and down and then PASSES OUT on the stage. In a moment odd enthusiasm, Aaron grabs the microphone and motions fo the band to start playing. Aaron continues the song.
