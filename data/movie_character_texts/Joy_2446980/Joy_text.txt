7) 160) dialog: Have you ever mopped around the toilet? (turns to the table) When was the last time any of you mopped your bathroom floor? (nothing) Well, let me tell you how it works. The floor is covered in urine. It collects in a big halo around the toilet. And there’s other stuff on the floor too. Its disgusting. So your wife mops it up. She dunks her mop in the urine-water, takes the same mop into the kitchen and mops that floor, where your babies crawl on their hands and knees and drop their pacifier, and then they stick that pacifier back in their mouths. While this is happening, your wife is trying to wring the thing out, chapping her hands, breaking her back and eventually getting down on her hands and knees to finish the job that the mop can’t do. She spends most of her day this way, getting up and down on and off of the floor. And then you come home, after your busy day at the office, and your long commute home, and you wonder why you don’t get laid. 72. The men are all quiet.

7) 419) dialog: Ok. Do you have a manager that’s here? Somebody in charge while he’s gone?
7) 421) dialog: (sigh) So then no one can help me? To retain the business I’m doing with you? No one can talk to me about this right now, and no one can be reached by phone. There’s nothing that can be done. Is that what I’m getting?
7) 423) dialog: Which means never. 101. Joy looks at Ronnie, who nods.
7) 424) dialog: Tell you what. I’m gonna have a truck here in an hour. Please have the molds for my mops ready to go. I’m gonna have to take’em out of here.
7) 426) dialog: What do you mean you don’t have any molds here? You don’t have my molds?
7) 428) dialog: Then why does everything that’s shipped to my warehouse come from this address?
7) 430) dialog: What? How could it be a misprint? Ronnie where’s the shipping slip? Ronnie exits.
7) 431) dialog: Why are you giving me the run- around? This is Avalon Industries?

Now you stand here telling me this. I’11 tell you what. I’m coming back in an hour with a U-haul and somebody better produce my molds. You think I’m on your nerves right now? I haven’t even started.

7) 447) dialog: No one’s around. They are now on HAWTHORNE BLVD, a busy street.
7) 451) dialog: Come on! The car will not let her in. They won’t even make eye contact. 104.
7) 452) dialog: I know you can see me. Really? Thanks a lot.

7) 491) dialog: Okay./Then who’s been cashing my checks?
7) 493) dialog: Matty the Horse.
7) 495) dialog: I know what they do.
7) 497) dialog: We own the patent. We filed the paperwork.
7) 500) dialog: Why did you do it?

9) 60) dialog: Your Honor. Will you please ask Rudy to mop the floor? MATTY’S LAWYER Objection-- Joy looks at the judge.
9) 61) dialog: He invented it, I just want to see him use it. Ask him to come down and mop the floor.
9) 63) dialog: There’s no water in here, but you know what to do. Rudy, shaking his head, trying to act cool, dunks the mop the bucket, fumbles with the sliding mechanism a bit, pus instead of pulling, barely pulling it off. It’s not a CLE RESULT. Rudy looks at the judge, throwing his hands up as to say “See, I did it.”
9) 64) dialog: Sorry. One more thing. Can you ask my dad to take off the mop head and put it back on? Rudy tries to take the mop head off. He can’t figure out where the button is. He tries a few different unsuccessfu ways.

9) 67) dialog: This mop isn’t the first thing I’ve invented. Its just the first thing anyone has ever bought. Its really amazing seeing people buy this thing. It makes me feel something I’ve never felt before. Proud. I’m sure these guys have that same feeling. Because they have the ‘paperwork’ right there that says they own, conceived, and created my mop. They were the ones slipping on the floor of Sam’s Diner at midnight. They were the ones that figured out you need to put a pin in the mop or it won’t work right. Or that if you slip your finger over the housing when you’re assembling it, you’ll get your skin pinched every time. Right guys? They have to know about the skin pinching. Because they have the paperwork. It says this mop is theirs. You could tell by the way they talk about it. Its personal for them. It’s their blood, sweat, and tears. I don’t have that paperwork. It was taken out from underneath me. While I was busy trying to make this thing happen, I was betrayed. And I guess honesty and integrity don’t have a receipt. There’s no patent for hard work. (beat) My whole life people have been telling me you can’t do this and you shouldn’t try that and you don’t deserve this. It’s been like noise in my head for a very long time. I just wanna walk away from all the noise. To you, it’s a mop. To me, it’s a way out. All I’m asking for, your honor, is what has always been mine. And the paperwork to prove it. Thank you. The judge nods. He is quiet for a long time. He calls the bailiff over and whispers to him. The bailiff walks out o the room, then comes back with more paperwork. Joy watche every move. The judge finally speaks. 132.
