His whole being involved act of painting: nothing else in the world. The brush on the palette, stroking the canvas. Now that h it, there is nothing tentative about his painting.

9) 34) dialog: I have nothing to say.
9) 36) dialog: I know? Every painting I start again at the beginning, I’ll never know. VERMEER stabs a brush angrily towards a canvas propped on table - the Concert painting.
9) 37) dialog: There’s what happens when one pays heed to theory. A one-point perspective of nothing. A myriad of chalk lines going this way and that. Small bl colour dotted disjointedly over the canvas.

10) 25) dialog: It's a commission. Gone in a few days. You need never see. CATHARINA is laughing and crying. Sinks onto the chair in middle of the room.
10) 33) dialog: Catharina! Enough. CATHARINA blinks, turns round slowly to him. A wide, dang smile.
10) 35) dialog: You'll make yourself ill. VERMEER moves towards her slowly, cautiously. She stares with shining eyes, then quick as a snake, grabs a palette from the work table.
10) 37) dialog: Very well. Never taking his eyes from her he lifts down the Concert painting and puts the other on the easel. Tenderly lifts cover. Everyone cranes to look.
