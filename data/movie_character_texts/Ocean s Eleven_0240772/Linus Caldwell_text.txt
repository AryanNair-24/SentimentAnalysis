38) 4) dialog: Sorry 'bout that.
38) 6) text: The Stockbroker resumes his yacketing, oblivious, as Linus tucks his prize into his own jacket pocket, face betraying nothing. Only Danny appreciates the artistry performed here today. He folds the Sun-Times under his arm as...
39) 0) text: ... The SUBWAY SQUEALS to a stop. Linus jumps out, leaving his prey aboard, and a few moments later, Danny steps off, too.
41) 0) text: Linus exits, casually reaching into his jacket to count his winnings. And his face falls. All he finds where the stolen wallet once resided is a calling card. On one side, in engraved printing: "DANIEL OCEAN." On the flip side, in handwriting: "Nice pull. Murphy's Bar, Rush &amp; Division."
42) 0) text: On a tabletop: the Gucci wallet beside a half-drunk Guinness. Linus enters the front door, cases the joint, spots the wallet on the table, and Danny behind it.
42) 2) dialog: Who are you?
42) 4) text: Linus balks, prideful, but sense finds a way, and he sits.
42) 6) dialog: That wasn't work, that was practice.
42) 12) dialog: What is it?
42) 14) dialog: You're pretty trusting pretty fast.
42) 16) dialog: Fathers are like that. (off Danny's reaction) He didn't tell you? (as Danny shakes his head) He doesn't like me trading on his name.
42) 18) dialog: What if I say no?
42) 20) text: Linus considers. He looks down at the ticket, then at the wallet. It's one or the other. A waitress passes, and Danny signals her for his bill. When his attention returns to Linus, the wallet remains... but the ticket beneath his hand is gone. Linus is reading it.
42) 22) dialog: Las Vegas, huh?
43) 2) text: ... Livingston, Basher, Yen, the Malloys, Saul and Linus crowding his doormat. A taxi-van pulls away behind them.
44) 7) text: At the wet bar, Basher mixes a drink for Livingston; on a couch, Yen balances coffee-table ornaments into a skyscraper, to Frank's astonishment. In a corner, off on his own, Linus watches the company, his eyes narrowing, wary. Until...
44) 11) text: Linus trades nods around the room.
44) 17) text: And he follows, along with Frank and Livingston. Then Virgil, Turk and Yen. Then Saul. That leaves Linus, watching the line of men disappear. He turns to find Tishkoff by his side, staring at him.
44) 18) dialog: Hi.
44) 20) dialog: Yeah.
44) 22) dialog: Yeah.
44) 24) dialog: Yeah.
45) 6) dialog: Smash-and-grab job, huh?
46) 0) text: MOVING WITH a cash cart as security guards push it past tourists, past cocktail waitresses, past Linus sitting at a blackjack table.
73) 4) text: As Linus hauls in materials, Danny takes him aside.
73) 6) dialog: Benedict.
73) 10) dialog: (young and eager) Wait, wait, wait. All I get to do is watch him?
79) 0) text: Outside a restaurant's entrance, Rusty and Linus sit before two slot machines, idly dropping in quarters as they watch Saul receive the royal treatment.
79) 2) dialog: The guy is a machine.
80) 0) text: TERRY BENEDICT emerges from a Town Car and, from his haircut to his smile to his pant-cuffs, he is effortless perfection. He is Vegas royalty, yet he denies eye contact to no man. He strides into his casino and, appearing behind a pillar, Linus follows him in.
80) 1) dialog: He arrives at the Bellagio every day at two p.m. Same Town Car, same driver. Remembers every valet's name on the way in. Not bad for a guy worth three-quarters of a billion.
81) 0) text: The doors open, and Terry Benedict steps out.     Linus watches from a craps table.
81) 1) dialog: Offices are upstairs. He works hard, hits the lobby floor at seven on the nose.
82) 1) dialog: Spends three minutes on the floor with his casino manager.
82) 3) dialog: All business. Benedict likes to know what's going on in his casinos. There's rarely an incident he doesn't know about or handle personally.
83) 1) dialog: He spends a few minutes gladhanding the high rollers. He's fluent in Spanish, German and Italian, and he's taking Japanese lessons, getting pretty good at it. He's out by seven-thirty, when an assistant hands him a black portfolio. Contents: the day's take and new security codes. Then he heads to the restaurant. Indeed, as Benedict makes his exit, an assistant hands him a black portfolio.
84) 0) text: Rusty and Linus watch the entrance:    No one enters.
84) 1) dialog: Give him another ten seconds. Around the corner comes Benedict, carrying his black portfolio.
84) 2) dialog: As I said:   a machine.
84) 6) dialog: Two minutes after they've been changed, he's got 'em in hand. (beat) I'll tell you: you guys picked a helluva target. He is as smart and ruthless as they come. The last guy caught cheating here, Benedict not only sent him up for ten years, he got the bank to seize the guy's home and bankrupted --
84) 8) dialog: He doesn't just go after your knees, he goes after your livelihood. And everyone-you- ever-met's livelihood.
84) 10) dialog: You suicidal?
84) 12) dialog: Now comes the girl... if she comes in after he does, that means they're in a snit.
84) 14) dialog: The museum downstairs. She's the curator there. Wait... here she is. You'll like this.
84) 18) dialog: I don't know if we can use her yet. I haven't even caught her name.
84) 20) dialog: What?
95) 0) text: Just down the block from the Terry Benedict Trinity stands (for a few remaining moments) the edifice of the Paradiso, Reuben Tishkoff's bankrupted hotel-casino. A crowd has gathered to witness its destruction: Terry Benedict, for one, his finger on the button and his face in the spotlight; Tess another, standing (near)by her man; Danny, too, hidden within the masses, eyes fixed on his ex; and Linus, who keeps a steady bead on Danny.
100) 0) text: Linus hoses Basher off, his accent angry and thick as he spits out water and the story of his afternoon and if nobody understands a word he's saying, that's okay...
105) 0) text: Turk and Virgil man the front seats as Danny, Basher, Yen and Linus huddle in the back. Basher and Yen both prepare equipment for their raid: hooks and a rope for Yen, a small blowtorch and a drill for Basher.
105) 2) text: They nod and, with Danny, start out the van's rear door. Linus starts to follow but...
105) 4) dialog: Coming with you.
105) 6) dialog: (furious) But...
107) 0) text: Linus twiddles his thumbs, tired of being seated at the kids' table. Meanwhile, up front, another Mensa meeting has been called to order...
107) 24) text: They can be heard WRESTLING. Linus has had enough.     He sneaks out the van's back door without the Malloys hearing him.
108) 10) text: of the lab, and its beveled-glass stairwell. Linus scrambles up its steps, a flight ahead of a duo of chasin guards. As he ascends out of sight... Danny shifts his focus to -
108) 11) text: The other side of the building, and two more guards arriving on the roof and moving toward the staircase: Linus will be trapped.
108) 18) text: Both sets of guards appear on the rooftop, and find no Linus between them -- he's disappeared.
109) 0) text: A second-story WINDOW EXPLODES as a desk chair flies through it, followed shortly by Linus who leaps onto a steel-mesh overhang running alongside the building.
111) 0) text: Linus runs along the overhang, then leaps down, onto the reversing van, and rolls along its roof and down its windshield.
111) 4) text: Linus scrambles back over the van, and Danny and Yen pull him in. Virgil hits the gas for a quick getaway, but he does so before the rear doors are closed, and one of them slams shut right on Yen's hand -- CRUNCH!
112) 0) text: as it hurtles away. Basher tends to Yen, cradling his hand, and Danny stares down Linus, breathless.
112) 2) dialog: (he's had just about enough of Danny's shit) I got it.
117) 0) text: The Bellagio's CASINO MANAGER (the one Linus spied with Benedict before) checks in with his watchers.
120) 2) text: Rusty, smiling, looks to Linus, glowering, then to Danny. Before Danny can explain the doors part at the Mirador Suite, where Livingston greets them urgently.
121) 13) dialog: I do. He's been chasing Benedict's woman. Got into a real snarl with him two nights ago. (off Danny's look) I was tailing you.
121) 15) text: Before Linus can answer...
121) 31) text: Danny stares daggers at Rusty. But he can see: everyone in the room is on Rusty's side. Defeated, he stalks out of the room, onto a balcony, but not without staring down Linus.
121) 33) text: Rusty turns to Linus.
121) 35) text: Linus's eyes drift to Danny outside -- whatever acrimony he felt before, he never meant to kick Danny off the job. He nods, half-cocksure/half-scared-pissless: he's up for it.
121) 37) text: Livingston exits. Everyone else in the room staggers about, like witnesses after an execution. Rusty steps out onto the balcony, perhaps to console Danny, but (as Linus watches them from inside) their words cannot be heard.
127) 0) text: Linus stands dressed in a sharp, conservative suit -- a far cry from the threadbare thief in Chicago. Rusty circles him, inspecting.
127) 2) text: Linus clasps them.
127) 4) text: Linus goes for his pockets.
127) 6) text: Linus does.
127) 8) text: Linus shifts his balance.
127) 10) text: Linus looks down.
127) 12) text: Linus looks up.
127) 18) text: Linus is left utterly bewildered, a thousand commandments to remember and fifteen minutes to remember them in.
132) 0) text: RISING FROM a spotless pair of wingtips shifting side-to- side, OVER hands flexing and stretching, UP TO Linus Caldwell. He keeps an eye on the cage door, waiting for Benedict to appear, as he tries anything to shake out his nerves. Then, from a discreet earpiece he wears, comes:
132) 2) dialog: (breathes deep)
133) 0) text: Linus's smile disappears as he continues to bounce. There's a KNOCK at the door.
136) 0) text: Linus nods, shakes out his hands some more...
136) 3) dialog: Deep breaths, deep breaths.
136) 5) dialog: Mr. Benedict...
136) 7) dialog: (presents proper identification) Sheldon Wills. Nevada Gaming Commission. Could I have two minutes of your time?
138) 0) text: and counting. MOVING WITH Benedict and Linus into the Pit Boss's station.
138) 1) dialog: It only came to our attention this morning, Mr. Benedict. Apparently he has a record longer than my arm.
138) 7) text: Benedict and Linus wait, side-by-side. While Linus does his best to play it cool, Benedict dips into his portfolio.
140) 0) text: Linus half-nods in response, and Benedict notices. Suspicious of the young man, he decides to test him.
140) 2) dialog: Been there about two years.
140) 4) dialog: (a pause; will he pass?) Not since he died last year.
140) 11) text: Linus and Benedict lead Frank away.       As they pass an elevator... ... its doors open, revealing Turk and Virgil, dressed now as security guards, pushing out the false-lid cash cart. They leave behind a pile of dishes, waiter uniforms, a tablecloth.
142) 0) text: Frank stands at attention before Linus and Benedict. Linus, straddling a desk, takes a beeper off his belt when it pinches him. Benedict checks his watch: the fight's opening bell is growing closer and closer.
142) 1) dialog: Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Escalante. (as Frank nods, not at all) Or should I call you Mr. Catton?
142) 4) dialog: You are Frank Catton? Formerly of the Tropicana, the Desert Inn and the New York State penitentiary system?
142) 9) dialog: (as Frank remains quiet) Your silence suggests you don't refute that. (to Benedict) Mr. Benedict, I'm afraid you've been employing an ex-convict. As you know, the N.G.C. strictly forbids...
142) 11) dialog: (a pause; he can't believe he just heard that) Pardon me.
142) 13) dialog: That has nothing to do with...
142) 15) dialog: (a beat, then) I resent your implication that race has anything to do with this. (to Benedict) Now, as I was saying, the Nevada Gaming Commission strictly forbids the employment of the colored... (whoops) ... I mean...
142) 16) text: That does it: Frank attacks Linus, lunging at the man, and as Benedict steps in to separate the two...
142) 21) dialog: (a beat, then) Yeah.
148) 0) text: and counting. Benedict exits the casino Manager's office with Linus and Frank. Benedict hails two GUARDS...
148) 7) dialog: Of course. They start toward the exit.   But halfway there...
148) 8) dialog: My beeper.   I'm sorry.   I forgot it. Benedict hesitates: He's in an enormous hurry now, he's behind schedule -- he hates being behind schedule -- but leaving even a member of the Gaming Commission alone in his cage is a security risk. One glace at the cameras all about and he decides to risk it.
148) 10) dialog: Of course.   Enjoy the fight.
148) 12) text: Thank you. Linus smiles after him, withdrawing the page of combinations he lifted off the man. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00

158) 0) text: ... Linus hurries to the elevator, punching Benedict's combination into a keypad. The elevator doors open for him. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00                              1
160) 0) text: As Saul and his heart attack hold the spotlight, a security monitor flips from a shot of Linus entering the elevator to a Livingston-fed videotape of an empty lift.
161) 0) text: Linus immediately reaches up to the elevator's ceiling, rips down its panel to reveal a trap door. As he starts to push it open... ... a hand yanks it free from above.    It's Danny.
161) 2) dialog: What, didn't you trust me?
164) 0) text: Danny rips off his jacket and shirt to expose a rappellin line wrapped around his torso. Linus does the same.
164) 1) dialog: How'd you get here?
164) 3) dialog: But what about -- I mean, that whole thing with Rusty... Danny just smiles at him.
165) 1) dialog: Why'd you make me go through all this? Why not just tell me?
167) 0) text: As Danny and Linus work, affixing suction-cupped anchors to their rappelling lines...
167) 2) dialog: Huh?
167) 6) dialog: The fight...? (as Danny nods) Lewis. (as Danny shoots him a look) You like Tyson? (as Danny nods) How strongly do you feel about it?
167) 8) dialog: (shrugs) I'd go in for a buck.
172) 0) text: Peering down into blackness, Danny and Linus prepare to let go any moment...
172) 1) dialog: You ever rappelled before?
172) 3) dialog: Nope.
174) 8) text: And SNAP -- the CORDS reach their full extension, and Danny and Linus bounce up, watching the floor recede.
174) 9) dialog: Aaaaahhhhh!
176) 0) text: Coming to a rest about ten feet from the floor, Danny quickly pulls a slim blade and slashes the two coils straight across. He and Linus go tumbling to the floor as their drop lines recoil lightning fast to their elevator anchors, just before... ... the infrared lights go back on-line.
179) 0) text: Linus and Danny arise from where they've fallen, clutching their heads and rubbing bruises. Danny doesn't recover as quickly.
179) 1) dialog: You alright?
184) 0) text: Danny and Linus pry open the elevator doors and squeeze out. Just beyond the next doorway stand... ... three UZI-CARRYING GUARDS, hovering outside the vault door and wondering what the hell just happened to the lights.
186) 0) text: The Uzi-Carrying Guards turn their backs to the elevator shaft... ... and Linus and Danny appear in the doorway; they both snap gas pellets and slide them into the corridor.
187) 0) text: Danny and Linus enter, waving the faint remnants of the gas from their noses, tiptoeing past the guards' bodies.
187) 1) dialog: You think Yen made it out okay?
189) 0) text: Linus punches in the code for the door to the vault anteroom (the one he stole from Benedict). He steps back as it slides open, revealing -- -- the vault door:     it is sleek and immense and impregnable.

200) 5) dialog: You check the batteries?

202) 0) text: As Danny checks his batteries (the types with built-in power meters: both at zero percent), Linus ransacks the Uzi-carrying Guards' gear for replacements. He finds AA's in their flashlights.
202) 1) dialog: You know, you lose focus for one second in this game --
204) 5) text: Linus pulls... and the door opens.
205) 0) text: Danny and Linus enter. Silence. The cash carts have crumpled, and the vault gratings, blackened, have held.
205) 2) text: Linus goes to one of the racks and tentatively opens it... Yen pops up from within, his hair on end, looking like he just dropped out of a cyclone.
231) 2) text: First wave, in! Second wave, now! (there is RUNNING, PANTING, then Linus's voice, distant and panicked)
239) 9) dialog: feigns hysteria...
239) 10) dialog: Guys, someone's here!
