0) 3) dialog: Good morning.
0) 5) dialog: Daniel Ocean.
0) 7) dialog: As you say, ma'am, I was never charged.
1) 0) text: Three PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS sit opposite Danny, behind a table.
1) 2) dialog: My wife left me. I was upset.    I got into a self-destructive pattern.
1) 6) dialog: She already left me once. I don't think she'll do it again just for kicks. Glances dart between the Board Members.
1) 8) dialog: (deadpan)
2) 6) dialog: My wife's. He opens the letter, and as his eyes gaze over the papers within, he smirks just a little.
2) 10) dialog: I'm a free man.
3) 0) text: Danny pulls on civilian clothes and there's not a bare thread among them. He tugs his cuffs and smiles: The old skin feels good. One last item to don: a silver wedding band. Danny considers it. Will he put it on?
4) 0) text: A sign reads: "NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY." Someone has graffitied below it: "If you were in prison, you'd be home now." The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its frame, ready for release. (If it matters -- and if you notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.) He hovers   there for a moment, on the precipice of freedom.    The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side the gate,   and the view ahead is not pleasant (New Jersey):    Life is hard out there. But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step into free America...
6) 0) text: ... And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red carpeting. As we PULL UP TO Danny's face and SPIN AROUND him, we hear, then see the BUZZ of a CASINO floor: the HUM of CONVERSATION, the DING-DING-DING and THUNK-THUNK-THUNK from the SLOTS, the brisk WHIR of SHUFFLED CARDS. And to Danny, it's a hearth and fire and a comfy chair and a snifter of brandy. He's home.
6) 4) dialog: Hello, Frank. The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny, and his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself. He quickly hides his astonishment. FRANK
6) 5) text: I beg your pardon, sir. You must have me confused with someone else. My name is Ramon. See? He taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is the most African-looking Ramon you've ever seen. A pit boss circles close by and glares at them both. DANNY
6) 9) dialog: (as he goes)
7) 0) text: Danny checks his watch -- 12:58 -- then the lounge around him: prison had more nightlife. He nurses a bourbon, folds back the New York Times and scans.
7) 4) dialog: Ramon?
7) 7) dialog: This afternoon.
7) 10) dialog: (directly, this is why he's here)
7) 14) dialog: You kidding? I just became a citizen again. Frank stares at Danny a moment, finally catches his eye, and Danny can't help but grin: of course he has.
8) 0) text: MOVING WITH Danny and Frank.
8) 2) dialog: That would be criminal.
8) 4) dialog: Casinos.
8) 6) dialog: Oh, yes...
8) 8) dialog: Soon.   Interested?
8) 9) text: Frank smiles.    Danny has his answer.
9) 0) text: Danny pulls a business card from his jacket, picks up the phone again, and dials the card's number.
9) 3) dialog: Yes, Officer Brooks? My name is Danny Ocean. I'm just out, I'm supposed to check in with you within twenty-four hours. (listens) No, sir, I haven't gotten into any trouble. No drinking, no sir. (listens, finishes his bourbon) No, sir, I wouldn't even think of leaving the state.
14) 5) dialog: The bouncer mentioned there was a game in progress. I hope I'm not intruding.
14) 8) dialog: I don't remember.
14) 12) dialog: Why should I mind? Two cards, please... (long beat) I just got out of prison.
14) 19) dialog: I stole things.
14) 25) dialog: Gallery.
14) 27) dialog: Headmasks.   Some.
14) 29) dialog: My fence seemed confident enough.
14) 31) dialog: Some people just lack vision.
14) 35) dialog: Well, that's all behind us now.
14) 37) text: Danny smiles, icily -- of course, it's not -- then pulls out his wallet.
14) 38) dialog: I raise you five hundred dollars.
14) 39) text: A hush in the room. Danny has thrown down the gauntlet. He and Rusty hold each other's stares.
14) 53) dialog: (off Josh's further hesitation) What? Your girlfriend holding your purse?
14) 54) text: That does it. Josh is in. The bet's to Danny. He checks his hand, and Seth starts to whisper to Topher.
14) 55) dialog: Contrary to what Mr. Ryan may say, Seth, I always check my cards before I make a bet. But be cafeful. I could tell from your face you're holding three of a kind or better. (digging his wallet out) Five hundred to call. And two grand more.
14) 56) text: Danny stares Rusty down.      The others look a little pa
14) 60) text: Danny sets down his hand. Four nines. It's a winner. The others, jaws dropped, throw in their cards. For the first time tonight, Rusty blanches.
14) 64) text: As Rusty plummets in the estimation of all the guys around him, Danny rakes in his pot.
14) 65) dialog: Thanks for the game, fellas. (then) Hey, I hate to ask this, but could you sign something for me? It's for the guys in the joint. They just love all your shows.
15) 0) text: A queue of clubgoers erupt in a frenzy as Topher and company exit, and they begin signing autographs. Danny and Rusty exit, too, but of course nobody gives a shit about them.
16) 2) dialog: Unprofessional.
16) 5) dialog: Why do you think I came to see you first?
16) 6) text: Danny pulls out a wad of bills from his jacket, peels off half, and hands it to Rusty.
16) 7) dialog: Ten grand.   Half of it's yours.
16) 11) dialog: I've got something better for you.
17) 2) text: Danny stares at him:       next subject, please.
17) 4) dialog: It's tricky. No one's ever done it before. Needs planning, a large crew.
17) 6) dialog: Not loaded ones. It has to be very precise. There's a lot of security. But the take...
17) 8) dialog: Eight figures each.
17) 13) dialog: (deep breath, then) When's the last time you were in Vegas?
17) 15) text: Danny puts down his coffee. And shakes his head. And lifts three fingers: three casinos. Rusty must put down his coffee, too.
19) 0) text: Lights out on the 40th. Engraved brass announces:     J.A KUEHN &amp; ASSOCIATES, ARCHITECTS. Two flashlight beams strafe wood-paneled, elegant offices: Danny and Rusty on late-night reconnaissance. As Danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints, Rusty passes the time switching papers from a desk's in box to its out box. At last, Danny finds the right set of blueprints and drapes it across the desk; we, however, never see it.
19) 1) dialog: The vault at the Bellagio.
19) 4) dialog: Yep.
19) 9) dialog: (flips to next blueprint) These feed into the cages at both the Mirage and the M.G.M. Grand. (tapping vault) But every dime ends up here.
19) 11) dialog: Yes, they are.     Think he'll mind?
19) 16) dialog: Like what, you think?
19) 20) dialog: As long as we're hitting these three casinos, we'll get our bankroll. Terry Benedict has a list of enemies.
19) 22) dialog: (smiles, too) Aha.
19) 26) dialog: So...
19) 28) dialog: Uh-huh.    So what are you saying?
19) 30) dialog: Really? I thought it was much harder than that --
19) 31) text: Suddenly the Security Guard's flashlight beam hits them square in the eyes. Danny and Rusty put their hands up to block the light.
19) 32) dialog: Jesus, Oscar, lower it a little, will ya?
19) 36) dialog: Yeah, thanks. You mind if we borrow a couple drawings for the night? Make some copies.
19) 38) text: Danny withdraws his money clip, peels off a couple hundreds, and buries them in the Security Guard's hand.
19) 39) dialog: 'Preciate it.
19) 42) dialog: Why not do it?
19) 44) dialog: Because yesterday I walked out of the joint wearing my entire wardrobe and you're colddecking TeenBeat coverboys. (beat) Because the house always wins. You play long enough, never changing stakes, the house takes you. Unless, when that special hand comes around, you bet big. And then you take the house.
19) 50) dialog: A little. Did I rush it?   It felt like I rushed it.
19) 54) text: Danny and Rusty look at each other.
20) 0) text: REUBEN TISHKOFF, the grimace of a man in mid-movement, forever cemented on his face, scrutinizes his two lunch guests (Danny and Rusty) at his poolside.
20) 2) dialog: It's never been tried.
23) 2) text: Both Danny and Rusty look chastened.
23) 4) dialog: Reuben, you're right. Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs.
23) 7) dialog: Thank you so much for setting us straight. Sorry we bothered you.
23) 10) dialog: It was our pleasure.
23) 16) text: Danny and Rusty begin to circle the pool to leave. Tishkoff, of course, won't let them go that easily.
23) 18) text: Danny stops, almost as if he's been waiting for this question, which of course he has.
23) 19) dialog: The Bellagio, Mirage, and the M.G.M. Grand.
23) 24) dialog: What do you have against him? That's the real question.
23) 30) dialog: That's why we've got to be very careful. We have to be precise. We have to be well-funded.
23) 32) text: Danny and Rusty both smile; they've hooked their fish. And so it begins...
23) 34) dialog: Frank C. is in.
24) 1) dialog: Frank C. has developed a bad case of bronchitis and is putting in for a transfer to warmer climates.
25) 1) dialog: What about drivers?
26) 2) dialog: The Mormon twins?
26) 4) dialog: Electronics?
27) 4) dialog: How are his nerves?
29) 0) text: With a view of Livingston on the boardwalk...       Danny Rusty wait for him over espressos.
29) 2) dialog: Phil Turentine.
29) 6) dialog: No shit?   On the job?
29) 8) dialog: You send flowers?
29) 10) dialog: (onto next candidate) Basher...
33) 0) text: The Chinese National Circus, currently on tour in the Western United States. Trapeze artists, gymnastic teams, and trampoline daredevils fly, somersault, spin, and swing through the air. A full house applauds every feat. Danny and Rusty sit in the bleachers, surrounded by parents and kids munching on spindles of cotton candy. Tough guys in toyland.
33) 3) dialog: So he can walk on a rope.
33) 5) dialog: So he can juggle. We need a grease man, not an acrobat. Who else is on the list?
33) 9) dialog: Who else?
33) 11) text: Halfway across the wire, the funambulist sits. And very slowly, but without hesitation, he contorts himself into a ball, never losing his balance. Even Danny is impressed.
34) 0) text: Danny and Rusty exit the circus tent, head for their car.
34) 1) dialog: We need Saul.
34) 3) dialog: He get religion?
34) 5) dialog: You can ask him.
34) 6) text: Rusty stops, stares at Danny, sighs.
36) 19) dialog: And Saul makes ten.
37) 0) text: Danny and Rusty look weary from all this recruitment.   A nearby TV with the sound off plays a promo for an upcoming Tyson fight.
37) 1) dialog: Ten should do it, don't you think? (as Rusty shrugs) You think we need one more? (as Rusty shrugs) You think we need one more. (as Rusty shrugs) Okay. We'll get one more.
38) 6) text: The Stockbroker resumes his yacketing, oblivious, as Linus tucks his prize into his own jacket pocket, face betraying nothing. Only Danny appreciates the artistry performed here today. He folds the Sun-Times under his arm as...
39) 0) text: ... The SUBWAY SQUEALS to a stop. Linus jumps out, leaving his prey aboard, and a few moments later, Danny steps off, too.
42) 0) text: On a tabletop: the Gucci wallet beside a half-drunk Guinness. Linus enters the front door, cases the joint, spots the wallet on the table, and Danny behind it.
42) 1) dialog: Hi, Linus.   Sit down.
42) 3) dialog: A friend of Bobby Caldwell's.   Sit down.
42) 5) dialog: Bobby told me about you. Said you were the best set of hands he ever saw. Didn't expect to find you working wallets on the subway.
42) 7) text: Danny reaches into his jacket and sets a plane ticket on the table. He keeps his hand over it.
42) 11) dialog: You're either in or out, right now.
42) 13) dialog: A plane ticket. A job offer.
42) 15) dialog: Bobby has every faith in you.
42) 17) dialog: You do this job, he'll be trading on yours.
42) 19) dialog: We'll get someone else who won't be quite as good. You can go back to feeling up stockbrokers.
42) 20) text: Linus considers. He looks down at the ticket, then at the wallet. It's one or the other. A waitress passes, and Danny signals her for his bill. When his attention returns to Linus, the wallet remains... but the ticket beneath his hand is gone. Linus is reading it.
42) 21) dialog: That's the best lift I've seen you make yet.
42) 25) dialog: America's playground.
44) 8) dialog: Gentlemen:    welcome to Las Vegas.
44) 9) text: Danny stands at the top of the stairs leading into the room, flanked by Rusty and Tishkoff. He starts down...
44) 10) dialog: Everybody eaten? Good. Everybody sober? Close enough. Most of you know each other already. You probably haven't met Linus Caldwell before, he's Bobby's kid outta Chicago.
44) 12) dialog: Okay. Before we start, nobody's on the line here yet. What I'm about to propose to you happens to be both highly lucrative and highly dangerous. If that doesn't sound like your particular brand of vodka, help yourself to as much food as you like and safe journey. No hard feelings. (pauses, soberly) Otherwise, come with me.
45) 1) dialog: Gentlemen: the 14000 block of Las Vegas Boulevard. Otherwise known as the Bellagio, the Mirage, the M.G.M. Grand. Together, they're the three most profitable casinos in Las Vegas...
45) 4) dialog: Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault. Located below the Strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth. It safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it. (beat) And we're going to rob it.
45) 8) text: Danny picks up a remote control and flips on a panel of Tvs.
45) 9) dialog: Courtesy of Frank Catton, new blackjack dealer at the Bellagio, security tapes from the three casinos.
45) 14) dialog: Okay.    Bad news first. This place houses   a security system which rivals   most nuclear missile silos. First:    we have to get within the casino   cages --
45) 16) dialog: -- which anyone knows takes more than a smile. Next: through these doors, each of which requires a different six-digit code changed every twelve hours. Past those lies the elevator, and this is where it gets tricky: the elevator won't move without authorized fingerprint identifications --
45) 18) dialog: -- and vocal confirmations from both the security center within the Bellagio and the vault below - -
45) 20) dialog: Furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors --
45) 22) dialog: Once we've gotten down the shaft, though, then it's a walk in the park: just three more guards with Uzis and predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man. Any questions?
45) 28) dialog: (smiles, happy someone asked) The Nevada Gaming Commission stipulates: a casino must hold in reserve enough cash to cover every chip at play on its floor. As I mentioned, this vault services each of the three casinos above it. That means: during the week, by law, it must hold anywhere from sixty to seventy million dollars in cash and coin. On a weekend, between eighty and ninety million. On a fight night, like the one two weeks from tonight, the night we're going to rob it, at least a hundred and fifty million. Without breaking a sweat. (gazing about room) Now there are eleven of us. Each with an equal share. You do the math.
45) 35) dialog: (off everyone's astonishment) Oh, right. Sorry. I forgot to mention that.
45) 37) text: Danny smiles, his broad, sure-of-himself grin, the one Rusty couldn't deny earlier and these guys won't deny now.
45) 38) dialog: Yeah.
45) 40) dialog: Alright.   Here's how we'll begin.
46) 4) dialog: First task: reconnaissance. I want to know everything that's going on in all three casinos. From the rotation of the dealers to the path of every cash cart...
47) 1) dialog: I wanna know everything about every guard, every watcher, anyone with a security pass. I wanna know where they're from, what their nicknames are, how they take their coffee...
48) 1) dialog: Most of all, I want you guys to know these casinos. They were built as labyrinths, to keep people in. I want you guys to know the quick routes out.
49) 1) dialog: Second task: power. On the night of the fight, we're gonna throw the switch on sin city. Basher, it's your show. Basher drops into the hole, pulling the cover over him, as we PULL UP OVER the Bellagio and...
50) 1) dialog: Third task: surveillance. Casino security has an eye and ear on everything, so we'll want an eye and ear on them. Livingston...
51) 8) text: Danny looks to Rusty who, behind them, tampers with Livingston's audio-video setup: several portable monitors, a laptop and modem, telephone headset, etc.
64) 0) text: ... and transmits all the views of the cages onto the monitors upstairs. Danny and Rusty witness their appearance.
64) 1) dialog: Why do they paint hallways that color?
66) 1) dialog: Uh-oh.
70) 0) text: Danny and Rusty simultaneously lean forward.
72) 0) text: Danny and Rusty exhale.
72) 1) dialog: Well...
72) 3) dialog: Fourth task:    construction...
73) 1) dialog: We need to build an exact, working replica of the Bellagio vault.
73) 3) dialog: Something like that.
73) 4) text: As Linus hauls in materials, Danny takes him aside.
73) 5) dialog: Fifth task: intelligence. We need those codes, Linus. From the only man who has all three.
73) 7) dialog: Learn to love his shadow. (back to the team) Sixth task: transport...
73) 11) dialog: For now. You gotta walk before you crawl.
73) 13) dialog: (toward the Malloys) Sixth task: transport...
75) 1) dialog: ... Power, surveillance, transport...
75) 6) text: Danny's eyes flash from Tishkoff to Saul, behind him, dressed in his usual frumpy attire: that's what he missed.
75) 7) dialog: Get your wallet.
76) 2) dialog: It's Armani, Saul.
76) 4) text: Saul's not fooling anyone: he's scared, right down to his Florsheims. Danny nods to the tailor: "Give us a moment."
76) 5) dialog: Saul, you sure you're ready to do this?
76) 6) text: Saul turns away, and when he faces Danny again, his entire aspect has changed: His features stone, his eyes icicles.
76) 9) dialog: You're ready.
76) 10) text: Danny signals Tishkoff: let's pay, and Saul immediately slumps into his old self. To a mirror, he practices...
77) 2) dialog: There's a little over twenty grand there, Saul. Try to make it last. Saul pats down his pockets for something he can't find...
77) 4) dialog: (handing him Rolaids)
77) 7) dialog: Good luck, Lyman.
84) 15) text: Rusty looks up as... ... a beautiful woman (the one Danny saw on Benedict's arm in the New York Times photo) appears. Elegantly dressed, a knockout, she moves very much in her own private space. And Rusty's face just about drops at the sight of her.
86) 4) dialog: 29:47.   Everything okay in there? Yen responds. Of course, Danny doesn't understand him. But Rusty does, appearing behind him.
87) 0) text: Danny and Rusty adjourn from the warehouse.
87) 4) dialog: What is it?
87) 6) dialog: Ex-wife.
87) 8) dialog: It's not.   About that.   Entirely.
87) 10) dialog: You said you needed a reason. Well, this is mine. (beat) When we started in this business, we had three rules. We weren't gonna hurt anybody. We weren't gonna steal from anybody didn't have it coming. And we were gonna play the game like we had nothing to lose. Well, I lost something. Someone. That's why I'm here.
87) 14) dialog: If things go to plan, I won't be the one who has to make that choice.
87) 19) dialog: How'd she look by the way? Tess...
91) 4) dialog: (standing over her, grinning) Hello, Tess.
91) 6) dialog: I'm out.
91) 8) dialog: Of prison. You remember. The day I went for cigarettes and never came back. You must have noticed.
91) 10) dialog: (but he does) They said I'd paid my debt to society.
91) 12) text: Danny smiles.    Tess stares daggers.
91) 17) dialog: You're not wearing your ring.
91) 20) dialog: My last day inside.
91) 22) text: Danny reaches his hand (ringed) for hers (ringless), but she removes it from the table.
91) 24) dialog: Benedict?
91) 25) text: She freezes: Danny knows.       He smiles:   it's okay. to a passing waiter:
91) 26) dialog: (his fingers two inches apart) Whiskey and -- (then one inch apart) -- whiskey.
91) 28) dialog: You're doing a great job curating the museum.
91) 30) dialog: The Vermeer is quite good. Simple but vibrant. Although his work definitely fell off as he got older.
91) 34) dialog: And I still get Monet and Manet confused. Which one married his mistress?
91) 36) dialog: Right.   Manet had syphilis.
91) 39) dialog: You don't know how many times I played this conversation out in my head the last two years.
91) 41) dialog: Yes.
91) 43) dialog: You were never easy. (as she shrugs) Okay. I'll make this quick. I came here for you. I'm gonna get on with my life, and I want you with me.
91) 45) dialog: I only lied about being a thief. But I don't do that anymore.
91) 47) dialog: Lie.
91) 51) dialog: No, he's very clear on both.
91) 53) dialog: Year and a half.
91) 56) dialog: I only have one?
91) 58) dialog: Does he make you laugh?
93) 2) dialog: You can't. But what you can do is not throw away another five years.
93) 4) dialog: (leaning in) Listen, you don't love me anymore, you want to make a life with someone else? Fine, I'll have to live with that. But not him.
93) 6) dialog: I'm not joking, Tess.
93) 8) text: Danny exhales and leans back.
93) 11) dialog: Yes. But that doesn't mean I'm wrong.
93) 14) dialog: You said: you better know what you're doing.
93) 16) dialog: I know what I'm doing.
93) 19) dialog: Catching up.
93) 21) dialog: (extending his hand) Danny Ocean.
93) 27) dialog: I was shocked myself.   Imagine the odds.
93) 29) dialog: About the same. Everything you want is still on the other side.
93) 32) dialog: I just wanted to say hello.   For old time's sake.
93) 35) dialog: (simultaneously) -- I can't.
93) 38) dialog: You never know.
93) 40) dialog: So I should put those towels back.
93) 44) dialog: (smiles, rises) Good seeing you, Tess.
93) 46) text: Danny goes.    When he's out the door...
95) 0) text: Just down the block from the Terry Benedict Trinity stands (for a few remaining moments) the edifice of the Paradiso, Reuben Tishkoff's bankrupted hotel-casino. A crowd has gathered to witness its destruction: Terry Benedict, for one, his finger on the button and his face in the spotlight; Tess another, standing (near)by her man; Danny, too, hidden within the masses, eyes fixed on his ex; and Linus, who keeps a steady bead on Danny.
100) 8) dialog: (as he hardly understands this either) Basher. What happened?
101) 1) dialog: So...
101) 3) text: Danny rises and paces, frustrated.      He's come too far things to go awry now.
101) 7) dialog: By tomorrow?
101) 8) text: Danny keeps pacing; Rusty hangs his head and thinks; Basher dries his hair.
101) 10) text: Danny stops; Rusty looks up.
101) 11) dialog: What -- is a pinch?
103) 5) dialog: Could a pinch take out the power of an entire city? Like, I don't...
103) 7) text: Danny and Rusty trade a look:        They have their answ
103) 8) dialog: Where?
105) 0) text: Turk and Virgil man the front seats as Danny, Basher, Yen and Linus huddle in the back. Basher and Yen both prepare equipment for their raid: hooks and a rope for Yen, a small blowtorch and a drill for Basher.
105) 1) dialog: (to Basher and Yen) You two ready?
105) 2) text: They nod and, with Danny, start out the van's rear door. Linus starts to follow but...
105) 3) dialog: What are you doing?
105) 5) text: Danny smiles and shakes his head.
106) 0) text: Danny picks a lock, then he, Yen, and Basher disappear into the lab's interior.
108) 0) text: Turk and Virgil are still wrestling as the trio appears. Danny, Basher and Yen pile in the back...
108) 1) dialog: We got it.   Let's go.
108) 5) dialog: Wait a minute.
108) 7) dialog: Where's Linus?
108) 8) text: Everyone realizes:    he's not here.   Just then: SIRENS and ALARMS and lights come to life.      Uh-oh. Danny spins to look out the back of the van, Basher by his side. His eyes scan the compound, then:
108) 9) dialog: There he is.
108) 10) text: of the lab, and its beveled-glass stairwell. Linus scrambles up its steps, a flight ahead of a duo of chasin guards. As he ascends out of sight... Danny shifts his focus to -
108) 15) dialog: He knows where we are.
110) 1) dialog: Alright, back it up, back it up!

150) 9) text: The Goons shake their heads. Danny smiles at the Bruiser, and the Bruiser snarls back, showing off those gums. He rolls up his shirtsleeves, itching to tear a hole in this man. The Goons head for the door.

193) 3) dialog: Okay.
