43) 1) dialog: Trick or treat.
43) 2) text: ... Livingston, Basher, Yen, the Malloys, Saul and Linus crowding his doormat. A taxi-van pulls away behind them.
44) 7) text: At the wet bar, Basher mixes a drink for Livingston; on a couch, Yen balances coffee-table ornaments into a skyscraper, to Frank's astonishment. In a corner, off on his own, Linus watches the company, his eyes narrowing, wary. Until...
44) 17) text: And he follows, along with Frank and Livingston. Then Virgil, Turk and Yen. Then Saul. That leaves Linus, watching the line of men disappear. He turns to find Tishkoff by his side, staring at him.
51) 3) dialog: Well, it's not the least accessible system I've seen, but it's close. I don't suppose they have a closed-circuit feed I could tap into?
51) 7) dialog: Then this is definitely a black bag job. Do they employ an in- house technician?
51) 8) text: Danny looks to Rusty who, behind them, tampers with Livingston's audio-video setup: several portable monitors, a laptop and modem, telephone headset, etc.
56) 5) text: ... bud... And with the Sentry out of position... ... Livingston (dressed now in a technician's uniform, don't worry about how he got it) goes quickly to the door and swipes the newly-acquired keycard and when it flashes red-to-green, he enters...

62) 0) text: Livingston's work here is almost done: he clips a small mechanism (known in his industry as a "spider" -- it's small, black, antenna-less and hides in dark places) to a main conduit, then verifies a tiny receiver he holds is picking up the spider's feed. One last click into place...
65) 0) text: Livingston steps outside. His job done, he exhales and wipes the sweat from his brow and checks his palm for directions and... Whoops. His sweat just smeared the ballpoint. He's flying blind. He looks left down a corridor, then right, trying to remember which way he came from. No idea.
67) 0) text: MOVING WITH Livingston as he tries to find his way out. He takes a left... Whoops again: here comes Fat, dead ahead.    Livingston has no recourse but to march right by him.

69) 0) text: Livingston approaches the exit's keypad and swipes his keycard: the light does not flash red-to-green.
69) 2) text: Livingston looks: he swiped the wrong side of his keycard. He tries again. Red flashes to green. He pulls the door... ... but Fat blocks it.       Livingston peers up, certain had it.

71) 5) dialog: Thanks.
86) 0) text: A facsimile of the Bellagio vault sprouts into shape. Livingston fixes a security camera in a corner, then matches its image (of Frank staple-gunning floorboard into place) to a security tape of the real McCoy. On the other side of the garage, Turk and Virgil go to work on their newly-purchased vans, with wrenches and blow torches. Tishkoff recognizes a gasket Virgil handles.

100) 4) text: Reuben leans into Livingston...
100) 6) dialog: I'll explain later.
118) 0) text: Livingston has moved A/V operations into Lyman Zerga's suite. As he scours the same images the watchers downstairs do, he eavesdrops on their communications through his headset.
118) 10) dialog: Yikes.
120) 2) text: Rusty, smiling, looks to Linus, glowering, then to Danny. Before Danny can explain the doors part at the Mirador Suite, where Livingston greets them urgently.
120) 3) dialog: We have a problem.
121) 1) dialog: You've been red-flagged. It means the moment you step on the casino floor, they'll be watching you. Like hawks. Hawks with video cameras.

124) 14) dialog: (over STATIC)
127) 16) dialog: Rust, can you come here a sec?

133) 7) text: Livingston raises a hand, and as Turk serves him his plate, Virgil whips off the cart's tablecloth: underneath it's the false-lid cash cart. Rusty turns to a corner.
137) 10) text: On "now" a RUNNING CLOCK APPEARS ON-SCREEN, descending from 29:59. It will REMAIN there for the duration of the pre-pinch heist, jumping at times BETWEEN SCENES. Rusty seals Yen inside the cash cart, then gives the top a tug: it's shut tight. As Virgil redresses it with the tablecloth, Turk snatches back Livingston's penne on the way to the door.
137) 11) dialog: You get no tip.
139) 2) dialog: His head blocked the last two numbers. (into his microphone) We missed it, Linus. You gotta grab the combination yourself.
146) 3) dialog: (into mike)
147) 1) dialog: Bash!

194) 2) dialog: There's still the five pins and the floor sensor. Not much we can do about that from this side of the door. But from this side...
198) 0) text: Livingston et al. are alert to the danger.
198) 1) dialog: (into his mike) Linus, can you read me? Linus, do not blow the door, you're about to kill Yen.
