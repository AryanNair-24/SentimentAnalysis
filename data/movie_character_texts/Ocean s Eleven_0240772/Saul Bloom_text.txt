33) 0) text: The Chinese National Circus, currently on tour in the Western United States. Trapeze artists, gymnastic teams, and trampoline daredevils fly, somersault, spin, and swing through the air. A full house applauds every feat. Danny and Rusty sit in the bleachers, surrounded by parents and kids munching on spindles of cotton candy. Tough guys in toyland.
35) 0) text: SAUL BLOOM, 50s, befuddled, wearing a corduroy jacket patched at the elbows and a duffer's hat, counts out money through the window, lists his bets. He checks his tickets, plunges them into his pants pocket, and moves off...
35) 3) dialog: I saw you in the paddock before the second race, outside the men's room, when I placed my bet. I saw you before you even got up this morning.
35) 5) dialog: Never better.
35) 7) dialog: My doctor says I need vitamins.

36) 4) dialog: Number four.
36) 5) text: There's the BELL; the electronic rabbit is released and the dogs break out of the gate. From this point on Saul's eyes never leave the race.
36) 6) dialog: You gonna ask me? Or should I just say no and get it over with?
36) 8) dialog: Nothin'. I got a duplex now, I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish, I'm seeing a nice lady, she works the unmentionables counter at Macy's. I've changed.
36) 10) dialog: Quit connin' me.
36) 15) dialog: He breaks late. Everyone knows this.
36) 17) dialog: You gonna treat me like a grownup at least? Tell me what the scam is?
36) 18) text: Under the noise: Rusty leans in and whispers in Saul's ear. Saul's eyes widen, then glaze over as all around him people are standing and shouting. Rusty places an envelope in Saul's lap, then gets up and walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish line... last by several lengths. Saul considers his options. In one hand: a fan of losing tickets. In the other (courtesy of Rusty): a ticket to Las Vegas.
43) 2) text: ... Livingston, Basher, Yen, the Malloys, Saul and Linus crowding his doormat. A taxi-van pulls away behind them.
44) 0) text: Along one wall, a buffet table has been set up, and while Virgil and Turk pile shrimp onto plates, Saul pockets an orange for later.
44) 4) dialog: (last man you'd see in the Tabernacle) Not as much as I'd like.
44) 17) text: And he follows, along with Frank and Livingston. Then Virgil, Turk and Yen. Then Saul. That leaves Linus, watching the line of men disappear. He turns to find Tishkoff by his side, staring at him.
45) 33) dialog: I have a question. (as Danny turns to him) Say we do get into the cage, and through the security doors there, and down the elevator we can't move, and past the guards with guns, and into the vault we can't open...
45) 36) dialog: Say we do all that. We're just supposed to walk outta there with a hundred million dollars in cash on us without getting stopped?
45) 39) text: Saul looks panic-stricken; like that, his ulcer has flared up, and he pops a Rolaid in his mouth.
75) 6) text: Danny's eyes flash from Tishkoff to Saul, behind him, dressed in his usual frumpy attire: that's what he missed.
76) 0) text: A tailor fits Saul for the finest suits Tishkoff's money can buy. As Saul smoothes out a coat sleeve...
76) 1) dialog: This is nice material.
76) 3) dialog: It's very nice.
76) 4) text: Saul's not fooling anyone: he's scared, right down to his Florsheims. Danny nods to the tailor: "Give us a moment."
76) 6) text: Saul turns away, and when he faces Danny again, his entire aspect has changed: His features stone, his eyes icicles.
76) 7) dialog: If you ever question me again, Daniel, you won't wake up the following morning.
76) 8) text: They exchange a long, fierce glance; Saul's eyes never waver.
76) 10) text: Danny signals Tishkoff: let's pay, and Saul immediately slumps into his old self. To a mirror, he practices...
76) 11) dialog: Hello.  My name is Lyman Zerga... (this time a little deeper) My name is Lyman Zerga...
77) 0) text: Saul's dressed completely (and immaculately) now in Armani, with his hair slicked back, a brief moustache on his lip, and impenetrably dark glasses riding the bridge of his nose. He continues to practice, his accent even deeper now and specifying no geographic origin -- could be Scottish, could be Israeli...
77) 1) dialog: My name is Lyman Zerga... My name is Lyman Zerga... Danny passes him an envelope full of $100 bills.
77) 3) dialog: You seen my...
77) 5) text: Bought you a fresh roll. The limo pulls to a stop, and outside there is a flurry of FOOTSTEPS before Saul's door swings open, and Turk and Virgil (both costumed as bodyguards) stand waiting for him.
77) 8) dialog: (hesitates, then gets out)
78) 0) text: Saul, as Lyman Zerga, makes as low-profile an entrance into the Bellagio as he can with bodyguards preceding and trailing him. He approaches a V.I.P CONCIERGE...
78) 4) dialog: My name is Lyman Zerga.   I'd like a suite, please.
78) 6) dialog: (long glare at him) I don't make reservations.
79) 0) text: Outside a restaurant's entrance, Rusty and Linus sit before two slot machines, idly dropping in quarters as they watch Saul receive the royal treatment.

90) 2) dialog: I don't believe in weakness. It costs too much. I don't believe in questions, either.
92) 0) text: At the table, Saul bets heavily for the bank. Benedict approaches, stands off to the right, watching.
92) 2) text: High Roller turns over a nine.     Saul wins.
92) 11) dialog: Mr. Benedict. I recognize you from the TV. You know, nine casinos out of ten, owner comes up in the middle of the hand to ask me what I want. I respect your waiting.
92) 15) dialog: And I have to impose on your hospitality. Can you sit in for a hand?
92) 17) dialog: That's a shame. You're the king of Vegas and you have to play craps in the alley.
92) 20) dialog: The fight is Saturday, is it not?
92) 22) dialog: No, no. Hand-to-hand combat doesn't interest me. I have a package arriving here Saturday evening. A black briefcase, standard size, the contents of which are very valuable to me.
92) 24) dialog: The house safe is for brandy and grandmother's pearls. I'm afraid I need something more secure.
92) 29) dialog: (his looks stops Benedict) I can assure you, Mr. Benedict, your generosity in this matter will not go overlooked. Now: what can you offer me besides the safe?
92) 30) text: Saul's eyes are pure steel: he is not a man familiar with being denied. And Benedict recognizes that fact.
93) 18) text: Terry Benedict is hovering over them, fresh from his meeting with Saul.
118) 5) dialog: (as Lyman)
121) 3) text: A pall falls over the room: this is more than a problem, this is disastrous. Only SAUL dares make a noise, HUMMING and SPLASHING in the next room.
121) 5) dialog: (as Lyman) It's time when I say it is.
121) 10) dialog: (himself again) I'm out.
121) 20) dialog: (appearing in a bathrobe) Tess is here?
121) 40) dialog: Tess is with Benedict now? (as nobody responds) She's too tall for him.
124) 8) dialog: Mr. Benedict.
124) 10) dialog: I have no reason to suspect otherwise. My couriers should be here momentarily. A beat as Benedict studies Saul.
124) 12) text: Benedict and Saul emerge, guards positioned around them.
125) 0) text: A white, unmarked van pulls in from the street and races up to the curb where Saul and Benedict wait. Turk Malloy gets out the passenger's side, a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist, as Virgil comes around from the driver's side, both of them dressed in their bodyguard suits.
125) 2) dialog: Thank you, Friedrich, Gunther. He turns, nods to Benedict, and they retreat into the hotel, the security guards and Malloys flanking them.

126) 7) dialog: Of course not.
126) 8) text: Saul turns to dismiss Virgil and Turk when... ... passing by, on his way to a sports betting window, an old RACETRACK DENIZEN happens past this cabal and, worse yet, happens to recognize Saul.
126) 10) text: Saul does his best to ignore the man. But even Benedict notices: this guy seems to know Lyman Zerga.
126) 12) text: At last Saul turns to face this man, with shark's eyes.
126) 13) dialog: Friedrich, Gunther.
126) 15) dialog: Mr. Benedict... (gesturing to the cage; re: his briefcase-cuff) Please: I have never enjoyed the touch of steel to my skin.

130) 4) text: Saul stares at him:     none of your fucking business.
130) 6) text: Saul lifts the velvet tray out of the case, and Benedict pats down the case's interior. Saul replaces the tray.

152) 0) text: A guard wheels in the Yen-filled cash cart, parks it in a station next to its twin, then -- as an afterthought -- plants Saul's briefcase right on top if it -- clunk -- an unforeseen obstacle to Yen's escape.

154) 2) dialog: Yes, I'm very satisfied.
154) 4) text: On the monitor, the vault door closes, but Saul looks anything but satisfied. He's sweaty, his mouth's so dry he can't swallow, and he keeps patting down his pockets for his Rolaids, without finding them.
157) 0) text: ... and Saul spots him, but so does Fat...
157) 4) text: ... and Saul can't handle the suspense: He grips his arm and groans and this is no ulcer problem, this is a full- cardiac, and Walsh, Fat, and Slim all attend to him, their backs turned as...

185) 0) text: Yen continues to push up on the cash cart lid, and the more he pushes, the more Saul's briefcase slides off. Yen stretches his hand out to grab it, but it's slid beyond his reach, to the edge of falling.
188) 0) text: Saul's briefcase inches closer to falling off the cash ca which of course would trigger the floor sensor and termin this heist here and now. Yen's hand stretches farther out grab it, pushing up just a little more on the false lid until... ... the briefcase tumbles toward the floor... ... but not before Yen snags the handcuff chain attached it and swings it round. He's got it. That threat over, he throws open the cash cart lid and takes the biggest breat of his life.
190) 0) text: Yen now sits perched atop the cash cart, Saul's briefcase opened beside him (he has removed half of Lyman's "emeralds").
