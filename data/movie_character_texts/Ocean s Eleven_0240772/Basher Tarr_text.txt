30) 1) dialog: Sweet...
30) 2) text: BANG! Wood shards and SPLINTERS of GLASS fly all around; Basher merely ducks his head and whistles. As the dust settles, three men move quickly past Basher and into (what the settling fog now reveals to be) a dynamited bank vault. ALARMS begin to sound: this is bad news.
30) 3) dialog: (to the rest of his gang, his temper flaring) You know, you guys had one job to do.
31) 0) text: The men exit through the front doors, their hands over their heads, Basher trailing them. Policemen and SWAT members encircle the group, weapons trained on them, chock full of instructions.
32) 0) text: Basher sits in the rear, handcuffed behind his back, feet on the pavement. An explosives COP kneels in front of him.
32) 4) dialog: Are you accusing me of booby- trapping?
32) 9) dialog: That's right.
32) 11) text: The Cop looks bewildered. Rusty steps forward, yanks Basher onto his feet, spins him around. He moves his hands up and down Basher's legs, around his waist, under his arms.
32) 17) dialog: Done.   Thirty seconds all right?
32) 19) dialog: (as we hear something SNAP from behind his back) Now.
32) 22) dialog: Not quite.   Is Danny here?
32) 24) dialog: Be good working with professionals again. (beat) Okay: go.
32) 27) text: And behind them the SQUAD CAR ERUPTS with a BANG! A collective SCREAM rises from the crowd, everyone ducks, cops hit the ground and cover their heads. Rusty and Basher move briskly past them, dodging their splayed legs like tires on an obstacle course. By the time the Explosives Cop thinks to look around for Basher, they've both disappeared. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01                              27.
43) 2) text: ... Livingston, Basher, Yen, the Malloys, Saul and Linus crowding his doormat. A taxi-van pulls away behind them.
44) 7) text: At the wet bar, Basher mixes a drink for Livingston; on a couch, Yen balances coffee-table ornaments into a skyscraper, to Frank's astonishment. In a corner, off on his own, Linus watches the company, his eyes narrowing, wary. Until...
44) 16) dialog: What the hell.
49) 0) text: With two dozen other tourists, Basher crosses the street and when he meets a manhole cover he stops and, extracting a small metal hook from his jacket, removes it from its perch, so casual about the action that no passerby looks twice at him.
94) 0) text: Nobody lights a match, this place is a powder keg. Basher sits on his bed, surrounded by combustibles, whittling and polishing a plastic explosive into an emerald shape. There's a KNOCK at the door...
94) 2) dialog: (eyes never leave his work) Just jumping into the shower, can you come back later?
96) 4) dialog: Shit.
97) 0) text: FROM ABOVE, SLOWLY DESCENDING: Ten of our eleven (Basher is missing) surround the model of the three casinos. Rusty leads everyone in a run-down of the heist...
99) 0) text: The Bellagio vault has been fully reproduced here, and what we've been watching has been a trial run. Ten of the eleven (Turk and Virgil in guard costumes, Basher is still missing) watch from offstage, like a film crew watching a dress rehearsal.
99) 3) text: From a dead squat, Yen leaps, hands first, from the cash cart to a ledge five yards away, and grips it safely with both hands without touching the floor. From this position, he'll inch his way to a counter, then, to the door... Frank pays up. Behind him, a DOOR SLAMS, and he turns to see Basher, at last. Sniffing the air, he double-takes -- Basher's covered head-to-toe in sewage.
99) 4) dialog: (and he's not happy) We're in deep shit.
100) 0) text: Linus hoses Basher off, his accent angry and thick as he spits out water and the story of his afternoon and if nobody understands a word he's saying, that's okay...
100) 3) dialog: The damn demo crew didn't use a coaxial lynch to back the mainline! Onioned the mainframe couplet!
100) 7) dialog: Blew the backup grid one by one! Like dominoes!
100) 10) dialog: They did exactly what I planned to do. Only they did it by accident. Now they know their weakness. And they're fixing it.
100) 11) text: An ECHOING FOOTSTEP draws the attention of the city engineers, and Basher retreats into the waterfall.
101) 0) text: Basher towels off his hair...
101) 2) dialog: So unless we decide to do this job in Reno, we're screwed.
101) 8) text: Danny keeps pacing; Rusty hangs his head and thinks; Basher dries his hair.
101) 9) dialog: (an idea occurs to him) We could use a pinch.
102) 1) dialog: A pinch is the equivalent of a cardiac arrest for any broad-band electrical circuitry. Or better yet: A pinch is a bomb... but without the bomb. Every time a nuclear weapon detonates, it unleashes an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down any power source within its vicinity. That tends not to matter in most cases because the nuclear weapon destroys everything you might need power for anyway. Now a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse, but without the headache of mass destruction and death. So instead of Hiroshima, you get the Seventeenth Century.
103) 2) dialog: About ten seconds.
103) 6) dialog: Las Vegas? (beat) But there's only one pinch in the world big enough to handle it.
103) 9) dialog: (a beat, then balefully) Pasadena.
105) 0) text: Turk and Virgil man the front seats as Danny, Basher, Yen and Linus huddle in the back. Basher and Yen both prepare equipment for their raid: hooks and a rope for Yen, a small blowtorch and a drill for Basher.
106) 0) text: Danny picks a lock, then he, Yen, and Basher disappear into the lab's interior.
108) 0) text: Turk and Virgil are still wrestling as the trio appears. Danny, Basher and Yen pile in the back...
108) 8) text: Everyone realizes:    he's not here.   Just then: SIRENS and ALARMS and lights come to life.      Uh-oh. Danny spins to look out the back of the van, Basher by his side. His eyes scan the compound, then:
108) 14) dialog: (who speaks Danny's mind) Then there'll be two of us who need saving.
112) 0) text: as it hurtles away. Basher tends to Yen, cradling his hand, and Danny stares down Linus, breathless.
129) 0) text: Of which, importantly, we never see the exterior, just an air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror... The white VAN SCREECHES to a halt inches from Basher who stands ready beside the pinch (and the now-gutted and dismantled mockup of the Bellagio vault) and faster than a NASCAR pit crew Basher, Turk and Virgil load the pinch into the white van's rear and before you can say "electromagnetic pulse" the VAN SCREECHES back out of the warehouse fully loaded. The time is 7:16.
131) 0) text: The white van slows enough to unload Virgil and Turk, changed into waiter uniforms, and they hurry a table- clothed room service cart inside as Basher pulls away.
146) 2) text: Give Basher the go.
147) 0) dialog: driving the white van, listening to a books-on-tape of Jane Eyre.
147) 2) dialog: (turning Bronte down)
147) 5) dialog: I'm there. And he SCREECHES to a halt on the parking structure's top level. Vegas can be seen in every direction. OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00
170) 1) dialog: (fixing the pinch atop his van) Just give me a minute.
170) 5) dialog: Then give me thirteen seconds.
170) 6) text: And Basher leaps down to hook up the pinch's wires to his van's engine.
173) 0) text: Basher finishes preparations.
173) 1) dialog: (into his mike) Ready.
173) 3) text: Basher flips the switch. BOOM! A quick TREMOR, then stillness. He picks a point on the horizon, like Babe Ruth, and suddenly...
173) 4) dialog: ... One...
173) 9) dialog: ... two, three...
173) 12) dialog: ... four, five...
174) 5) dialog: ... six, seven.....
174) 7) dialog: ... eight, nine...
175) 1) dialog: ... ten...
178) 0) text: All the lights are back on, and Basher observes his achievement with great pride, his job complete.
178) 1) dialog: Viva Las Vegas.
194) 0) text: As Basher enters, Livingston and Frank watch on a monitor Linus punching in the combination he stole from Benedict as Danny unravels a thin electrical wire connected to a detonator.
194) 4) dialog: ... a little bit of Semtex should do the trick.
201) 0) text: Livingston, Frank, and Basher watch the monitors in disbelief... Saul enters, alive and dressed as himself again.      His job is complete.
206) 0) text: Livingston, Frank, Saul, and Basher watch as the first wave of bills gets tossed onto the vault floor. Smiles all around.
210) 0) text: Frank, Basher and Saul watch over Livingston's shoulder as this phone conversation is broadcast over a small speaker.
239) 5) dialog: takes position next to Rusty at the elevator shaft's bottom. They're on-camera, but just a few feet away and (off-camera) Danny sits smiling.
