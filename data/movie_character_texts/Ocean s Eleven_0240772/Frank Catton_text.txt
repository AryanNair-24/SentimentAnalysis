74) 4) dialog: Yes, Denham, like a jean. (they shake) You know: you have lovely hands -- do you moisturize?
74) 8) dialog: I swear by it. I try all sorts of lotions. I went through a fragrance-free period last year, but now I'm liking this new brand fortified with rose hip. My sister, you know, she uses the aloe vera with the sun screen built in...
74) 10) dialog: I did. You know: they say cinnamon is wonderful for your pores. Read that on the internet. And that ideally you should be wearing gloves to bed, but I find that would interfere with my social agenda. Problem is: I get a reaction to camphor so I can't use traditional remedies...

From this position, he'll inch his way to a counter, then, to the door... Frank pays up. Behind him, a DOOR SLAMS, and he turns to see Basher, at last. Sniffing the air, he double-takes -- Basher's covered head-to-toe in sewage.
