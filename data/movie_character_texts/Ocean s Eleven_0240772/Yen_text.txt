44) 7) text: At the wet bar, Basher mixes a drink for Livingston; on a couch, Yen balances coffee-table ornaments into a skyscraper, to Frank's astonishment. In a corner, off on his own, Linus watches the company, his eyes narrowing, wary. Until...
44) 17) text: And he follows, along with Frank and Livingston. Then Virgil, Turk and Yen. Then Saul. That leaves Linus, watching the line of men disappear. He turns to find Tishkoff by his side, staring at him.
73) 0) text: The gang hauls building materials -- lumber, tools, paint, etc. -- and Yen hauls three times his share, carrying objects on his head/shoulders/arms, a circus act in a hardware store.
98) 2) text: Two guards wheel in a cash cart and leave it in the vault's center and march out again, closing the thick metal door behind them. When the vault LOCKS CLICK... ... We STOP DESCENDING, just above the cash cart. There is silence for a spell, the lights flicker out, then... ... the false top of the cart springs open, revealing Yen within, folded neatly.
99) 3) text: From a dead squat, Yen leaps, hands first, from the cash cart to a ledge five yards away, and grips it safely with both hands without touching the floor. From this position, he'll inch his way to a counter, then, to the door... Frank pays up. Behind him, a DOOR SLAMS, and he turns to see Basher, at last. Sniffing the air, he double-takes -- Basher's covered head-to-toe in sewage.

112) 0) text: as it hurtles away. Basher tends to Yen, cradling his hand, and Danny stares down Linus, breathless.
133) 9) text: In it, Yen finishes bandaging his busted hand and nods.
137) 0) text: The time is 7:27. Yen tucks himself into the cash cart's hidden compartment with a slim oxygen tank for company. Meanwhile, Rusty drills Virgil and Turk...
137) 10) text: On "now" a RUNNING CLOCK APPEARS ON-SCREEN, descending from 29:59. It will REMAIN there for the duration of the pre-pinch heist, jumping at times BETWEEN SCENES. Rusty seals Yen inside the cash cart, then gives the top a tug: it's shut tight. As Virgil redresses it with the tablecloth, Turk snatches back Livingston's penne on the way to the door.
152) 0) text: A guard wheels in the Yen-filled cash cart, parks it in a station next to its twin, then -- as an afterthought -- plants Saul's briefcase right on top if it -- clunk -- an unforeseen obstacle to Yen's escape.

185) 0) text: Yen continues to push up on the cash cart lid, and the more he pushes, the more Saul's briefcase slides off. Yen stretches his hand out to grab it, but it's slid beyond his reach, to the edge of falling.
188) 0) text: Saul's briefcase inches closer to falling off the cash ca which of course would trigger the floor sensor and termin this heist here and now. Yen's hand stretches farther out grab it, pushing up just a little more on the false lid until... ... the briefcase tumbles toward the floor... ... but not before Yen snags the handcuff chain attached it and swings it round. He's got it. That threat over, he throws open the cash cart lid and takes the biggest breat of his life.
190) 0) text: Yen now sits perched atop the cash cart, Saul's briefcase opened beside him (he has removed half of Lyman's "emeralds"). He hears the muffled Danny's slaps and he knows: it's time for his leap. It's the same distance as the leap he made in the practice session, but this time he's only got one good hand.
192) 0) text: Yen prepares for his leap, then springs... ... across the room, to the ledge he must grab... ... and he grabs it, but with only one hand he's slipping right away, and in a second he'll hit the sensored floor... ... but, in a flash, he spins and splits his legs, propping himself up between two walls, inches above the floor.

195) 0) text: Yen sets the last of Lyman's emeralds against the vault door like a plastic explosive... which, of course, it is. He affixes a detonator receiver (the size of a golf ball pencil) to it, then slaps the door twice: all set.

199) 0) text: Yen finally frees himself just as -- -- ZOOMING INTO a plastic explosive --
200) 0) text: Yen, still on the door, remains frozen.       Trembling. A beat. Then, he starts to creep back, leaping onto a money shelf, then another, as far from the explosives as he can get.
203) 0) text: Yen catches his breath on the far end of the room. He hears the slap, rolls his eyes, and ducks out of the line of fire.
205) 2) text: Linus goes to one of the racks and tentatively opens it... Yen pops up from within, his hair on end, looking like he just dropped out of a cyclone.
