Simon tries to figure out where it's coming from; the sky the house, the highway at the end of his block... Finally he focuses on... The blacktop right before him, smeared with his own blood Music starts. He kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the  pavement. He stretches out his hand and places it flat on the road. The pounding is louder now, becoming the beat o the music over the scene. Simon lowers his face to the pavement, closes his eyes an Puts his ear right down against the road. He hears... The steady tread of somebody very much larger than life. Kneeling forward, with his ear to the ground, Simon opens his eyes and sees... A man approaching. The music swells up full. Simon lifts his head slowly from the road, looking off in wonder at... This stranger coming towards him; an oddly handsome freak striding over the crest of the distant intersection with windswept mane, two over-stuffed suitcases and a crumpled tie fluttering back over his broad but crooked shoulders. Simon rises till he's kneeling up straight in the road. Henry Fool finally reaches him and stops. Titles finish. Simon says nothing and watches as Henry looks off at the  house.

7) 25) text: Henry drinks and looks down into the raging fire.
7) 26) dialog: (wistfully) I've been bad. Repeatedly. (shrugs and steps  away) But why brag? The details of my  exploits are only a pretext for a  far more expansive consideration of  general truths. (contemplating the  notebooks) What is this? It's a philosophy. A  poetics. A politics, if you will. A  literature of protest. A novel of  ideas. A pornographic magazine of  truly comic-book proportions. It is,  in the end, whatever the hell I want  it to be. And when I'm through with  it, it's gunna blow a hole this wide  straight through the world's own  idea of itself!
7) 27) text: He smokes. Simon is impressed. They hear a bottle smash  outside in the street and Henry goes to the window. They' throwing bottles at the house.

This crowd of drunken  motherfuckers hired by the local  drug cartel shows up at my hotel  room and threatens to tear me limb  from limb. And I say, listen, hombres,  OK, you've got me outnumbered four  to one and you're gunna kill me here  tonight and not a soul in this dimly  lit world is ever gunna notice I'm  gone. Fine. But one of you... one of  you... one of you is gunna have his  eye torn out. Period. Silence. I  repeat myself. One of you poor,  underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye  ripped out of its socket. I promise.  It's a small thing, perhaps, all  things considered. But I will succeed.  Because it's the only thing I have  left to do in this world. So why  don't you just take a good look at  one another one last time and think  it over for a few minutes more. (smokes, waits) They sober up a little, look at their  shoes in confusion, then step out  into the hall to talk among  themselves.

15) 8) dialog: Verse.
15) 10) dialog: Look, in my opinion, this is pretty  powerful stuff. Though your spelling  is Neanderthal, and your reasoning a  little naive, your instincts are  profound. But the whole thing needs  to be given a more cohesive shape.  It can be expanded. Followed through.  Unified. (smokes, then) You see what I'm getting at?
15) 11) text: Simon just stares at him, overwhelmed. Henry drops the  notebook on the floor and points at it with his cigarette
15) 12) dialog: Are you willing to commit yourself  to this? To really work on it? To  give it its due? In the face of  adversity and discouragement? To  rise to the challenge you yourself  have set?

20) 3) text: Henry lifts up one of Simon's newly acquired classics...

20) 10) dialog: You need time to write, Simon. To  study. To reflect.
20) 12) dialog: We all have to make sacrifices. A  vocation like ours, Simon, is not a  nine to five thing. You can't put a  fence around a man's soul. We think  and feel where and when we can think  and feel. We are the servants of our  muse and we toil where she commands.

But still, I've gotta stay up late  at night to outdo the unending parade  of mundane little atrocities I see  committed every day right out in the  open spaces of this loud and sunlit  culture we call home.
35) 22) dialog: I like to think so. But the fact is  I appreciate depravity. Nevertheless,  I insist your vocation makes a  difference, because to hold out  anything other than a spiritual  yardstick to reality is to be jerking  off grandly into the abyss.

44) 28) text: Henry stops and turns. Simon pauses, then...
44) 30) text: Henry watches him for a moment, then swaggers closer...
44) 31) dialog: I got caught.
44) 32) text: Simon waits for more but is disappointed. With one final  cracked grin at his friend, Henry throws back his shoulde slicks back his hair and strides off. Simon watches him g and frowns, not comforted. He flips through the pages of  Paradise Lost.

46) 1) dialog: (frowning) Peachy. Gimme a light. BUГ‘UEL Have you found a job?
46) 2) text: Henry just glares at him and smokes. BUГ‘UEL How 'bout those Alcoholics Anonymous  meetings, did you go over and visit  them yet?
46) 3) dialog: What happened to this assistant  librarian position you were supposed  to set me up with?
46) 4) text: BuГ±uel looks down, disappointed. BUГ‘UEL I tried, Henry. I really did.
46) 5) dialog: So what happened? BUГ‘UEL Henry, with your background... Well,  I mean, with your record, they didn't  think it'd be right to have you at  the neighborhood library.
46) 6) dialog: Why not? BUГ‘UEL They thought you'd be a bad influence  on the kids.
46) 7) text: Henry sits back, offended. BUГ‘UEL (adds) Or worse.
46) 8) dialog: So my word is not enough. My promise  worthless. The fact I've served my  time nothing but the emblem of my  continuing guilt. BUГ‘UEL Apparently.
46) 9) text: Henry leans back and sighs, furious and indignant.
48) 0) text: Moments later. Simon arrives with a six-pack and finds Henry sitting in  front of the fire, staring into the flames, brooding dark
48) 1) dialog: I was caught. Yes, I was caught...  once. I was caught in flagranti  delicto screwing a thirteen-year-old  girl named Susan. She was an ugly  and mean-spirited kid, but she knew  how to play upon my weaknesses which,  I admit, are deep and many.
48) 3) dialog: You appear shocked.
48) 5) text: Henry stands and leans over the fire.
48) 6) dialog: It was a pathetic little conspiracy.  A transparently desperate attempt to  discredit me and my ideas; to label  me a mere pedophile. As if I'd be  ashamed of such a thing. As if  Socrates himself hadn't been taken  out of circulation for corrupting  the youth of Athens!
48) 8) dialog: Seven years. Seven years for one  afternoon of blissful transgression.  But what of it? Who cares? Prison's  not so bad; particularly if one's a  sex offender, free from the popular  and conventional horror of sodomy.
48) 10) dialog: They were not 'lost years'.
48) 12) dialog: I put them to good use. I began my  major work. My opus.
48) 14) dialog: Believe me, Simon, this incident  with the girl, prison... It pales to  insignificance in the wider context  of my career.
48) 16) dialog: Nothing in comparison to the day my  'Confession' is unleashed. (beginning to pace) What an orgy we'll have then, huh?  What shouts of outrage from the  offended populace, from the  sanctimonious purveyors of culture  and quality, the righteous defenders  of what ever inane and haphazard  notion of progress then in vogue.  They'll be beside themselves with  fiercely reasoned critical analysis.  Apoplectic with indignation!
48) 18) dialog: Their feelings will be hurt.
48) 20) dialog: Yes, like a mirror which reflects  only the inside of the person before  it, my 'Confession' will lovingly  render humanity's common monstrosity  in all of its lurid wide screen glory.
48) 22) dialog: Why should I blush or feel shame  before the common lot of humanity,  anyway, for a few banal and, again I  admit, inelegant transgressions?
48) 24) dialog: After all, really, I'm doing  civilization a favor.
48) 27) text: Henry sits staring into the flames again. He pauses, then
48) 28) dialog: Soon.
50) 5) text: Fay pays for her tissues and makes her way to the back of the store where she finds Simon with Henry, who is holdin forth to his friend and the small coterie of high school  students surrounding them...
50) 6) dialog: The greats all say the same thing:  little. And what little there is to  be said is immense. Or, in other  words, follow your own genius to  where it leads without regard for  the apparent needs of the world at  large, which, in fact, has no needs  as such, but, rather, moments of  exhaustion in which it is incapable  of prejudice. (drinks) We can only hope to collide with  these moments of unselfconsciousness.  This divine fatigue... this...
50) 8) text: Henry takes the typed manuscript from her and continues..
50) 9) dialog: As I tried to make plain in Paris:  'Nous savons que nous avons chutГ©  parce que nous savons qui nous  sommes.' 'We know we have fallen  because we know who we are.'
50) 11) dialog: (interrupted) That's beside the point. But did  they listen to me? Of course not!
50) 15) text: She drops her head to the table and cries. Henry and Simo look on in silence. Then Henry continues...
50) 16) dialog: For is this not the best of all  possible worlds? Are not the evils  of this world necessary components  of a cosmos that could not exist  without them?
50) 19) dialog: (smokes, shrugs) Unfortunately.
50) 21) dialog: (aggravated) At. One. Time.
50) 23) text: Simon looks from her to Henry. Henry winks at him.
50) 24) dialog: Go ahead. But never let yourself be  flattered.
50) 27) dialog: Who?
50) 30) text: Henry seems a bit put upon.
50) 31) dialog: Because it's not done yet.
50) 40) dialog: (continues) The thing to do is to send parts of  it to different magazines and literary  journals first. That kinda thing.  You know. Substantiate it.
50) 42) text: Henry sips his beer and looks at her.
50) 43) dialog: Filth, child. A preoccupation with  excrement. Why?
50) 45) text: Henry reaches across the table and shakes Simon's hand.
52) 0) text: Henry is shaving. Simon sits in the kitchen, sorting thro rejection letters...
52) 2) dialog: De gustibus non disputandum est.
52) 4) dialog: About taste. You can't argue about  taste. God, Simon.
52) 7) text: Henry drops his razor and stomps out into the hall.
52) 8) dialog: What do you mean you don't know why  you bother? You bother because you  know the poem is excellent!
52) 10) dialog: Of course you do!
52) 12) dialog: Can you sit there, look me straight  in the eye, and tell me you don't  think this poem is great? That it is  not at once a work of great lyrical  beauty and ethical depth? That it is  not a genuine, highly individual,  and profound meditation on the miracle  of existence?
52) 15) dialog: Can you?
52) 18) dialog: So, you see, you have no choice!
52) 23) text: Still no response. Simon gets up and stands in the bathro doorway. Henry is shaving.
52) 25) dialog: That might not be as easy as it seems.
52) 27) dialog: Well, it's been a long time. My name  might not carry as much weight as it  once did with Angus.
52) 29) dialog: We were close at one time.
52) 31) text: Henry puts down his razor and looks at Simon in the mirro
52) 32) dialog: Look, Simon, opinions come and go.
52) 34) dialog: To be honest; my ideas, my writing,  they haven't always been received  well or even calmly. They're  upsetting. I'm a controversial man.
52) 36) dialog: You see, what I'm doing is too  radical. Too uncompromising. It'll  take time for people to see its value.  It's ahead of its time, perhaps, or  maybe just... (stops) A recommendation from me might do  you as much harm as it does good.
52) 39) dialog: Because certain work needs to be  experienced all at once in order for  one to appreciate the full force of  its character.
65) 0) text: Henry paces back and forth. With the fingers of one hand  pressed against his forehead and his eyes closed tight in concentration, he dictates to Amy, who is sitting at a ta with her laptop computer, typing his every word.
65) 1) dialog: In the infinite amplitude of his  love, God wants to create the largest  number of best elements that can  exist together in one cosmos... OK.
65) 2) text: Amy types away, fascinated by Henry's intelligence.
65) 3) dialog: In an instantaneous calculation made  in eternity, God computes the best  possible world and creates it. Fine.  This 'decision' by God is uncontingent  and eternal rather than temporally  or ontologically sequential.
65) 6) dialog: What?
65) 8) dialog: O-N-T... Don't you have some kinda  spell-check on that thing?
65) 10) dialog: It is impossible for every perfect  good to be compatible with every  other perfect good. The intense beauty  of the mountain must be set off by  the fertility of the plain, so to  speak.
65) 12) dialog: The good of freewill must entail  real choices for sin.
65) 13) text: She gazes at his profile, in love. Henry sits thinking and Amy watches him reverently. She l over close and whispers in his ear. He turns and looks at her, alarmed.
65) 14) dialog: Listen, Amy, back off. I'm on parole.
65) 16) text: Henry jumps up and looks around, paranoid. He keeps his v down and points at her.
65) 17) dialog: Hey! I don't look at you.
65) 19) dialog: I look at a lot of people that way.
65) 22) text: Henry sees she's genuinely upset and feels bad. He sits b down and lays his hand on hers.
65) 23) dialog: No, as a matter of fact, I think  you're a real bright kid and I like  that about you.
65) 25) text: Now Henry tries to scare her away. He leers at her.
65) 26) dialog: I like it so much I've got half a  mind to do perverse things to you.  Right here. Right now. Things you  might just learn to like.
65) 27) text: She just stares at him, blinks, then looks away and tries imagine this. She takes her laptop and leaves, confused a blushing. Henry watches her go and grins, satisfied with himself.

68) 8) dialog: Why not!
68) 10) text: Henry throws his cigarette to the floor, steps on it and  returns to his magazine.
68) 11) dialog: This place is losing all its charm,  Mr Deng.
68) 13) text: Henry shakes his head in dismay and studies a centerfold.
68) 14) dialog: It's just a fad, Mr Deng. These kids  today, they're just slaves to fashion.
70) 0) text: Henry is leaning on the counter with a six-pack of beer,  pleading with Mr Deng.
70) 1) dialog: Come on, Mr Deng! How much do I owe  you?
70) 3) dialog: That can't be right! And so what? My  credit's good.
70) 6) dialog: Hey, Warren, you gotta couple of  bucks I can borrow?
70) 9) dialog: Ah, yes, of course. When noble minds  shrink from the task of leadership  scoundrels will rush in to fill the  void. (takes cash) Thanks.
70) 11) text: Henry pays Mr Deng for his beer.
72) 0) text: Moments later. Henry steps out of the store and stops when he sees Amy  standing there, pouting. He looks away and sighs. Amy pic at the fabric of her stockings and bites her lip.

72) 6) dialog: Take a powder, cupcake.
72) 8) dialog: Evaporate!
74) 0) text: Moments later. Henry comes into his house, hot and bothered, cradling hi six-pack. But he stops, listens, then steps through the  kitchen towards the living-room. He stops in the entrance and sees... Fay on the floor of the living-room, reading his 'Confess her mouth hung open in an astonished 'O'. He drops his six-pack and... She spins around, caught in the act. Henry stands in the doorway, pent up, sweating and with  perverse things on his mind. Fay, her hands palm down on the floor behind her, bites h lip, coquettishly. Henry looks her over like she was something good to eat. She feels his gaze all over her and twists to one side wi a breathless little shudder. He steps nearer, stands over her and she looks up at him.

90) 1) dialog: So I was a janitor! So what?
90) 3) text: Henry shrugs and qualifies...
90) 4) dialog: Well, I mean, we weren't like bosom  buddies or anything. But we used to  talk sometimes. In the elevator. In  the morning. He said he liked my  ideas. Being a janitor's a good job  if you're a writer. Especially the  night shift; all that time to think  and develop my ideas.
90) 6) text: Henry pulls the lever and the garbage gets crushed.
90) 8) dialog: Well, what the hell does he know? He  wouldn't know a vital piece of  literary art if it came up and bit  him in the leg. To hell with him!  He's not the only publisher in the  world!
90) 10) dialog: (smokes) It's true. A prophet is seldom heeded  in his own land. Remember that.
