4) 0) text: In a towel, Rebecca combs out her hair, staring at her ow reflection. Her skin is pink from the hot water. Now it’s clear how m of that makeup is a persona; a disguise. Because she look completely different in this light. She’s like a lost gir five years younger. She examines her left arm, with the elaborate tattoo. The inside of her forearm is more heavily inked. As if to cover over an older tattoo or birthmark. She looks at her right arm, currently bare. The inside of this arm is peppered with neat rows of shor scars. Too neat to be accidental. Rebecca used to be a cutter. For a brief moment, there’s a sadness in her expression rarely seen by someone twice her age. Then, she walls it up again in a deep breath, and steps out. INT. BEDROOM —- NIGHT It’s raining outside, now. Watersnake shadows slink down window, and the rain creates a soothing white noise. Bret is fast asleep on the bed. Snoring lightly.

6) 2) dialog: I love you, too! Reluctantly, he steps out into the weather. Makes his way down the sidewalk. Pauses, fishing for his car keys.

15) 30) dialog: She’s his mother.
15) 32) dialog: Becks. Did you do this to help him, or to hurt her? Rebecca crosses her arms. Nostrils flaring. In a scary ev tone, she tells Bret:
19) 0) text: Paul’s working space. Oak desk, home computer, filing cabinets. A small treadmill in the corner. That’s not the strange part. The weirdness is the fact that the framed photos have bee taken down. Paul’s diploma, his choice of landscape art.. Even the filing cabinets are partly gutted. Rebecca notices a corner of the room: A weird MAKESHIFT BED built from pillows and a quilt is tucked back behind one side of the desk, where the desk l has been unplugged, and the cord CHEWED OFF. Something new hangs on the wall here. It’s not the same dimensions as what used to hang on the hook; the paint on wall is discolored in a different shape. Rebecca leans in to look at the new framed photo: A black-and-white snapshot, at least thirty years old. Ev the frame suggests 1980s. It’s at a hospital, outside on the grounds. Slightly off center of the pic stands a WOMAN with her back to us, hea partly turned to look our way. The shade of a wild-shaped tree hides her face from us. 42. Rebecca looks around. Feeling like she’s being watched. Carefully, she takes the framed photo down from the wall. And slides the photograph out from under the glass. On the other side of the photo, some handwritten info in faded pen: “Diana / Mulberry Hill Rehab Hospital (1986)” Rebecca stares at the photo again with renewed tension. A the figure under that crooked tree could come to life. EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SOPHIE’S HOUSE - DAY Rebecca stands at the curb, still clutching the photo. Bret pulls up in his SUV and gets out. Approaches her.

19) 3) dialog: You okay?
19) 6) dialog: Don’t you think we should finish talking about last night? You know, when you kicked me out for trying to be honest with you? Rebecca takes a moment to remember. It’s readable on her face, “Oh, right.” Bret’s a bit surprised. She doesn’t remember? 43.
19) 9) dialog: Well, you should apologize to Martin, really. I mean, uh-- not like you did with me, but...
19) 11) dialog: Why?

25) 12) dialog: We can’t take the stuff out of here. So.
25) 47) dialog: The dude said not to take anything.
25) 49) dialog: Is that another session with Diana? Rebecca doesn’t look back at Bret. She watches the city lights drift by her window, thumb on the player.
25) 54) dialog: Hey -- INT. BRET’S SUV - NIGHT Rebecca snaps open her eyes -- Bret is nudging her. 57. She stops the player and pulls out the earbuds.

27) 8) dialog: You can be like this around me, you know. I’m not going anywhere. Rebecca looks at him curiously. Like she’s weighing a decision. Then:
27) 10) dialog: ...What?
27) 12) dialog: Seriously? She smiles and heads back up. Bret waits until she’s out of sight, then does a silent “touchdown celebration” move.
30) 17) dialog: Becca?
31) 0) text: Bret advances for the hall, shining his light down ahead him rather carelessly. He sees the basement door (built much like a door to a garage) rattling in its frame as Rebecca pounds on it fro the other side.

He struggles, legs flailing, arm raised-- And then he presses the ‘unlock’ button on the key fob-- 78. And his SUV’s headlights suddenly SHINE on the front of t house and in that very same breath-- Bret seems suspended in midair by nothing, and promptly f back to the front lawn.

Now that he’s back, Bret doesn’t take his eyes off the ho Two LAPD OFFICERS get out of the squad car. One male, one female. Both cool, calm, and collected.
