17) 21) dialog: Rebecca shudders. Crouches down and traces one of the let with her finger. It’s triggering some memory; her gaze wanders off the floor and up, as if she starts to see it the same room-- All the while darkness encroaches around her, until-- INT. REBECCA’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) A young REBECCA (age 10) sleeps in her bed. From somewher the room, a nightlight casts a wan glow over her. Then... with a brief BUZZ, the nightlight winks OUT. STAYING ON REBECCA who stirs in her sleep, some part of h aware that the light has changed. A door creaks open. Rustling sounds. Like a rat in a cupboard. 37. This wakes Rebecca. She blinks. Sits up. Her bedroom CLOSET DOORS hang open. Inside: pitch black. All is quiet. Then: the rustling continues.

Rebecca notices a corner of the room: A weird MAKESHIFT BED built from pillows and a quilt is tucked back behind one side of the desk, where the desk l has been unplugged, and the cord CHEWED OFF. Something new hangs on the wall here. It’s not the same dimensions as what used to hang on the hook; the paint on wall is discolored in a different shape. Rebecca leans in to look at the new framed photo: A black-and-white snapshot, at least thirty years old. Ev the frame suggests 1980s. It’s at a hospital, outside on the grounds. Slightly off center of the pic stands a WOMAN with her back to us, hea partly turned to look our way. The shade of a wild-shaped tree hides her face from us. 42. Rebecca looks around. Feeling like she’s being watched. Carefully, she takes the framed photo down from the wall. And slides the photograph out from under the glass. On the other side of the photo, some handwritten info in faded pen: “Diana / Mulberry Hill Rehab Hospital (1986)” Rebecca stares at the photo again with renewed tension. A the figure under that crooked tree could come to life. EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SOPHIE’S HOUSE - DAY Rebecca stands at the curb, still clutching the photo. Bret pulls up in his SUV and gets out.
