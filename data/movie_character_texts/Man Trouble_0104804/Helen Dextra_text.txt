69) 7) text: Looking in the   direction   of Joan's gaze she sees the figure of a man   wearing a   hood over his head, steppin out from behind   the sheet   of plywood, holding the ax his hand and as   he moves   toward the front of the car, screams. He lifts the ax over his head and swings it down vio- lently, cleaving the blade into the hood of the Mercedes. (From inside the house, DUKE can be heard BARKING furiously.) Joan leaps from the car and in stark terror, runs out of the garage toward the house. Stopped by the sounds of HELEN'S HYSTERIA, she turns around to see her, hampered by her crutches and unable to move. ON the hooded man's eyes, shifting their homicidal intent from Helen to Joan. Joan runs back into the garage and frantically tries to pull Helen away from her death grip on the door handle. The man begins stalking around the front of the car toward her. She grabs one of Helen's crutches and raises it up as if to hit him. As he steps back to the ax and tries to extract it from the hood, she suddenly rushes at him and begins belaboring him with the crutch. He lifts an arm to fend off the blows while his other hand con- tinues to tug at the ax handle.

In the struggle, she manages to sink her teeth into his hand. He pulls it free and hits her across the face. She reaches to a flower pot on a potting shelf and pole-axes him on the top of the head. It staggers him briefly and enables her to move out of his grasp. She immediately grabs an iron rake from the garden rack and turns fiercely toward him. Now standing, vanquished, breathing hard, and apparently having had enough, he begins to back away from her. When he reaches a safe distance, he turns and moves quickly off, disappearing into the dark.
