5) 14) dialog: See what I mean?
5) 19) dialog: So what, he's not interested in that, that's not what he's asking. (to Therapist)
5) 22) dialog: Pardon me, I was making a statement here.
5) 24) dialog: Well, I forgot the upshot of what I was saying, but...

10) 0) text: As Harry and Adele approach the passenger door of the van:
10) 1) dialog: ... at fifty bucks a shot, out a my pocket... (unlocking the door)
10) 4) dialog: I hear  you, honey. But let's have just a  little more trust on your end of  this thing, okay? That's all I ask. (opens the door)
19) 0) text: Duke lies on the floor, watching Harry. He stands at a cork board on the wall behind his desk, adding a clipping announcing the Fourth Victim of a local serial killer called the Westside Slasher, to an assortment of other items on violent crimes. As he does: JUNE HUFF, enters from a door of the rear of the office. Moving past Harry's desk, she picks up a folded newspaper page, continues to an upholstered bench beneath a window, lies down and begins reading.
19) 1) dialog: (moving to his desk) Now don't start lazing around, June. Let's get with it.
19) 5) dialog: It's very nice, Sluggo.   Go hose out the kennel.
19) 7) dialog: Where the hell are my nail clippers?
19) 9) dialog: I told everybody to stay out of these drawers.
19) 13) dialog: Get this first, will you.
19) 16) dialog: (cutting her off) Remember, don't say I'm here 'til you find out who it is.
19) 20) dialog: Yeah?   Who was it?
19) 22) dialog: Bastard.
19) 27) dialog: Don't give me a bad time, lard. I've got enough trouble with Iwo Jima and her complaints, alright? Now the woman doesn't even believe you're my niece.
19) 29) dialog: That's not the point I'm making.
19) 31) dialog: You know   what's gonna happen if I can't pay   these damn breeders and get some   adult dogs on the premises?    Pretty damn quick, some asses are   going to hit the pavement,   believe me.
19) 34) dialog: Jesus, here   I am, sitting in the center of a   lot of wealth, the escalation   in crime couldn't be better, and   I'm not turning a damn nickel   on it...
19) 36) dialog: Oh shit.    There's Lee.
19) 37) text: Across the street, a van not unlike Harry's can be seen. On the sidewalk beyond it, a man (LEE) stands putting coins in a parking meter.

24) 0) text: Joan, pacing about in nervous distress. She stops abruptly, throws her weapons onto the bed and moves purposively to her handbag. Rummaging through it, she finds the House of Bliss flyer, unfolds it and looks at the reassuring photograph of Harry and Duke.
25) 3) dialog: Duke, platz! (to Joan) Always the name first, and then the command.
25) 8) dialog: Now, in regard to any   aggressor seeking to give you a   bad time, I want to show you what   you can expect from a dog of   this caliber.
25) 10) dialog: Here we have the dog's arsenal, so to speak. The animal is trained to apply pressure to specific points of the body until the bone is more or less crushed. (releasing the muzzle) If the attacker is bearing a weapon of any kind, be it a gun, a club, a knife or what-have-you, the dog will, excuse me for saying... ("politely" indicating his crotch) ... automatically go for the testicles.
25) 12) dialog: You want him to do that.
25) 14) dialog: Believe   me, this will scare them, as well   as incapacitate their mind and any   ability to maneuver against   you.
25) 16) dialog: Let me ask you something. I like to get a general picture of the individual situation I'm working with.
25) 19) dialog: Are you married, single, living alone or with some other party?
25) 21) dialog: Well, the hills are hit heaven as far as burglaries go. And right up on Mulholland is where they found the fifth victim of the Westside Slasher...
25) 23) dialog: Believe me, I know what you're up against, being an attractive, and I take it, unattached woman, such as you are... (flicking his cigarettte away)
25) 29) dialog: Well, that's enough for a start on the basic control commands...
25) 31) dialog: Now let's do a little work with the assailant.
26) 1) dialog: She holds Duke on a short lead, and as they move along a wooded area of the grounds, he leans in close, directing her in confidential tones:
26) 2) dialog: Alright now, Joan, give him the command, 'Duke, wachen sie.'
26) 4) dialog: Good.   The dog is now on alert.
26) 5) text: As they walk, Harry glances about, impressed with the appearance of wealth inherent in the house and grounds:
26) 6) dialog: This is really a nice piece of real estate you've got here.
26) 8) dialog: Oh, it's your sister's. (pause) And where's she?
26) 10) dialog: Never look at your dog.
26) 14) text: They move forward a few feet, when Harry, now slightly behind Joan, makes a covert hand signal in the direction of some trees several yards ahead of them. June, in a padded attack suit, suddenly jumps out from behind the trees, assuming an aggressive stance and emitting a repertory of menacing sounds. JOAN                       HARRY
26) 15) text: Oh my God!                               Duke, fasse! Duke responds immediately, lunging toward June, pulling Joan along with him. June screams and starts to run away. Harry moves after Joan, yelling ahead to June:
26) 16) dialog: Dammit, June, don't exhibit fear until I tell you!
26) 18) dialog: Get him under control now, Joan.
26) 20) dialog: Give him the off command!
26) 23) dialog: Duke, aus!
26) 24) text: The dog instantly assumes a sitting position. Joan, out of breath and exhilarated with fear and excitement, turns to Harry:
26) 28) dialog: What did I tell you?
27) 0) text: at the desk making out a check while Harry, in the b.g., takes in a series of photographs on the den wall of some of the highlights in the life of Andy Ellerman. (See Appendix)
27) 1) dialog: Ordinarily I wouldn't do this, even on a temporary rental basis, because he's the absolute top security and attack dog in the country.
27) 3) dialog: Is this your sister?
27) 5) dialog: Uhm hmm. (moving to another photograph) Wait a minute, who's this guy, isn't this Red Layls?
27) 7) dialog: No kidding. Your sister's involved with Red Layls? This guy's gotta be one of the five or ten richest men in the country, with business connections all over the place.
27) 10) dialog: And she's your sister. That's amazing. I mean, this is an individual I'd really like to meet sometime.
27) 12) dialog: Boy, look at that figure. I have to say, your sister is really an attractive looking woman.
28) 0) text: June, in the b.g., still in the attack jacket, leaning sullenly against the van and watching Harry work.
28) 1) dialog: I'll skip back up in a day or two, okay, just to see how you're doing.
28) 3) dialog: And Joan, I want you to know, it's been a great pleasure doing business with you.
28) 5) dialog: Feel free to call on me for anything. Anytime of the night or day, 24 hours.
28) 7) text: As she gestures toward June, Harry takes hold of her hand, looking earnestly at her:
28) 11) dialog: I sincerely mean that.
29) 0) text: as Harry unzips the attack jacket:
29) 2) dialog: Come on, dumpty, don't start that. (removing the jacket) This is quality clientele. It calls for a certain kind of approach. (nods toward the house) Just soak some of this in, will you?
29) 6) dialog: Start to pattern yourself. Breed up. (tossing the jacket inside the van) Observe the woman, for Christ sakes.
29) 9) dialog: You don't screw this type of individual.
29) 15) dialog: This is the kind of atmosphere we want to gravitate toward. (opening the door) Did she even ask me the cost? (as he gets inside) Dammit, I really respect that.
36) 0) text: Harry, Joan and Duke following, moves along the glass facade, inspecting, then assessing the security status of the house:
36) 1) dialog: Well, I'd have to say this place                       * is a snap to break into.
36) 3) dialog: Don't worry. The dog'll take care                      * of anyone trying to get inside. She moves down into the living room, crossing toward one of the couches, with Harry following:
36) 5) dialog: No, you don't have to do that. This is just some ding-dong that's trying to scare you.
36) 7) dialog: But you don't want to give off that impression, by acting too timid or afraid, because that's what invites an aggressive attitude from certain types of men.                                                   *
36) 10) dialog: For instance, don't go mincing                          * along, taking mousey little steps, and waving your hanky, because                          * you're drawing a target on yourself if you do...
36) 14) dialog: Well, let's see. Just walk back and forth the way you normally do.
36) 18) dialog: Okay, but keep in mind that you want to exhibit a very confident attitude. Look like you know what you're doing and where you're going.
36) 20) dialog: Just remember to stop short of appearing a little dykey, because that's not attractive.
36) 22) dialog: No, no, you always want to remain a little bit attractive. Otherwise that can set somone off too.
36) 26) dialog: Sure you can, it's just a matter of degree.
36) 31) dialog: Uh-oh. (moves over to her and touches her gently) Now what's this?
36) 34) dialog: Tell you what. Let me take you out of here, buy you a drink, and               * see if we can't get your mind off these kind of things.

37) 4) dialog: I have to  tell you the truth... (he  pauses)
37) 9) dialog: You're probably quite a singer too. (looking back to her) I'd like to come down and catch you sometime.
37) 11) dialog: Very much. Even to the degree that when it's playing on the radio, I sometimes have to turn the damn thing off. Thinking he is revealing a peculiar brand of wit, she laughs.
37) 12) dialog: I just mean it starts to get to me too much. I can't swallow my saliva.
37) 14) dialog: Yeah, symphonies, operettas, poems, things like that. All those type of things really get to me.

39) 2) dialog: It depends on the man and woman you're talking about. They arrive at the fence and as she speaks she rests one of her hands on the railings:
39) 4) dialog: There I disagree with you. He places his hand over hers. She remains silent a moment, restraining her response to the gesture. Then:
39) 6) dialog: Is that right? (catching himself)
39) 9) dialog: We can go as slow as you want... why not?
39) 13) dialog: Oh yeah, absolutely.

44) 3) dialog: Oh don't worry about that.
44) 7) dialog: No, that's just normal in most of your adult males. Some percentage of the time they're gonna attempt to make these vulgar motions on your person.
44) 9) dialog: You just have to be very firm and stay on top of him.
45) 0) text: Joan and Harry   are seated on the couch having coffee as they listen to   a CHOPIN NOCTURNE. He is doing his best to emulate her   posture of thoughtful intensity as she listens, but as   he steals a look at her his adult male impulses causes   him to shift about slightly. She looks over at him:
45) 2) dialog: No, it's very nice.
45) 4) dialog: You know what's affecting me?
45) 6) dialog: You are.
45) 12) dialog: Don't worry about it.
45) 14) dialog: There's no problem.
45) 17) dialog: (not averse to being one of them) Uhm hmm.
45) 19) dialog: You know, I'm not one of these guys who's going to look upon you as an object.
45) 21) dialog: Because I look upon a woman as a whole.
45) 25) dialog: Other modes?
45) 27) dialog: Uhm hmm.
45) 29) dialog: But you don't want me to bring you                      * around.                                                 *

51) 4) dialog: Tell her we'll find it.
51) 9) dialog: No. He reaches to an ashtray on the night stand and quickly douses his cigarette:
51) 13) dialog: Let's just take a run out there.
53) 0) text: Harry is none too happily confined to the passenger seat as Joan, white knuckling on the wheel, obsesses on Andy:
53) 2) dialog: Well the guy must be doing something right to have amassed that amount of wealth.
53) 4) dialog: Joan, can I make a suggestion?
53) 6) dialog: You better try an keep up a little with the flow or we're gonna get cited.
54) 0) text: Harry stands scowling for effect, his arm around Joan. MALE ADMISSION'S CLERK sits at a computer behind a counter, keying up a file, then reading if off the screen: A.C.
54) 2) text: How do you know he was her physician? HARRY
54) 12) dialog: Okay, let's stop wasting time here, where is this guy, what's his name?
54) 16) dialog: What kind of business are you running here, buddy?
55) 0) text: Joan wanders anxiously around the waiting room. In the b.g., Harry can be seen at one of the pay phones. Seeing him hang up, she stops pacing and looks toward him. POV: He approaches, answering her expectant look with a shake of the head and the disheartening news:
55) 1) dialog: Nothing.   No Dr. Monroe Park.
56) 0) text: Harry and Joan, moving toward the hospital parking lot: JOAN
56) 1) text: How am I supposed to find this man? Maybe he used a false name, or maybe he isn't even a doctor... HARRY

56) 5) text: I mean, you hear all kinds of things, about government kickbacks, and Panamanian drug couriers and... HARRY
56) 7) text: No, really, I have to do something. I have to go to the police... He stops walking and takes a hold of her hand: HARRY
56) 9) text: Oh, that's nice. HARRY
56) 11) text: You called me honey. HARRY
56) 15) dialog: I want to get a hold of this top private investigator, who's a close, personal friend of mine, okay, and get him to find out who this doctor is.

The view is inclusive of The House   of Bliss across the street. He lowers the paper as a waitress (VITA) appears with a Silex of coffee. She sits down opposite him, refilling his cup and addressing him in a familiar manner:
57) 2) dialog: No, it's not what you think. This is a very unique individual I'm talking about. Plus there's a mind there, as well as a body and a face.
57) 6) dialog: I'm telling you, this is something completely different. You gotta meet her. She sings opera and has                      * the hands of a hula dancer...
57) 8) dialog: Anyway, you remember that private                      * detective that use to come in here all the time? On the portly side, bald, had kind of crossed eyes...
57) 10) dialog: Yeah, that's him. How do you think I could get a hold of him?

59) 6) dialog: You're talking to the wrong godammed party, you know that?
59) 8) dialog: No, you hear me out, friend...
59) 9) text: He takes note of the driver (STURGE) coming around the front of the car. He stops a few feet off and unbuttons his jacket, revealing the cross-strap of a shoulder holster. Harry steps over to the window, leans down and communicates in more politic tones:
59) 10) dialog: Look, I happen to have a very high regard for this party. And maybe I even have some feelings of a personal nature here.
59) 14) dialog: Goddamned right.
59) 18) dialog: Wait a minute.
59) 20) text: Harry stands up, leaving the vulnerable area of his stomach framed in the passenger window. When he leans back down, a deeply conflicted expression is apparent on his face:
59) 21) dialog: You know, that's not necessarily entirely accurate, I mean, I don't know where you come up with these so-called facts, but... (at a loss, he looks off, shaking his head) I can't go sneaking around, stealing this lady's property.
59) 27) dialog: What do you mean, 'unpleasant'?
59) 29) text: He holds the voucher out to Harry who avoids looking at it:
59) 30) dialog: Jesus Christ, I hardly know the woman. I'm just renting a dog to her, that's all. (looking at Moncrief) What kind of a person do you take me for?
59) 31) text: Harry stands in the parking lot, watching as the Con- tinental drives off. He starts to move toward The House of Bliss, then stops and opens the voucher, braving a look at it.

64) 5) dialog: Oh come on, you're way off.
64) 7) dialog: Well, he's right, I could've told you that. This is a man who goes fishing with the President, honey. (grabs a pack of cigarettes) He's a little high up to go around burglarizing people and sending them nasty notes. So why don't you just ease back on this thing for awhile... (lighting up) Life's too godammed short.
64) 9) dialog: I'm trying to chase the guy down, okay? But don't go and make yourself sick...
64) 11) dialog: I mean, Jesus, why don't you just get this damn thing and hand it over to me and I'll give it to these guys.
64) 15) dialog: Yeah, to Red, or whoever...
64) 17) dialog: Dammit, you're making my work more difficult for me, you know that!
64) 19) dialog: I tell you what the hell to do and you don't listen to me!
64) 22) dialog: I'm not ordering you around. I'm just giving you my opinion. And maybe I get tired of hearing about this stuff all the time, this book business, this manu-whatever, and Red Layls, and your sister.
64) 24) text: As she crosss to the door, Harry stands up:
64) 25) dialog: Ah honey, now...

65) 0) text: Harry, envelope in hand, moves with determination down the block from his building. He approaches a mailbox, pulls the handle on the letter drop and inserts his hand inside the chute. He holds it there a moment, seized by indecision, and then brings his hand back out, still holding the envelope. Turning around, he angrily stuffs it into his back pocket and heads back to the House of Bliss.
68) 2) text: Harry steps INTO VIEW, only half-listening and grumbling:
68) 3) dialog: What's her problem.
68) 5) dialog: Now what's she complaining about?
68) 10) dialog: ... I come over here to look at the ball game and you give me these clowns.
68) 12) dialog: I mean, what's wrong with these women.
68) 14) dialog: They don't want to hear the truth, that's what disturbs me.
68) 18) dialog: You tell them the truth and they come at you with a cleaver.
68) 20) dialog: What guy?
68) 23) dialog: You're going to leave me, lard, just after I've broken you in, and taught you the fine art of dog training?
68) 25) dialog: (shakes his head and sighs) Women. (then back to the TV) What's the score?
73) 0) text: Joan, her garments soiled and disheveled from the pre- vious scene, comes from the vicinity of the front door, closely followed by Duke and Harry:
73) 1) dialog: Why didn't you have the damn dog with you, that's what he's for!
73) 3) dialog: What the hell good is that! You have to have him with you at all times!
73) 8) dialog: Yeah, but that's before he tried to part your hair with an axe!
73) 11) dialog: Wait a minute. How tall was he? About six one? Kind of ugly?
73) 12) text: Helen, now with a drink in her hand, steps INTO VIEW behind Harry:
73) 19) dialog: Forget about him. I know what I'm talking about...
73) 21) text: She takes the drink out of Helen's hand and drains it while Harry continues:
73) 22) dialog: Guy like Red Layls have hit men working for them, that drive them around and do their dirty work for them.
74) 0) text: Harry sits on chaise trying not to catch glimpses of Joan, who is changing her clothes in the closet. The mood is more subdued.
74) 2) dialog: It's not more than one person. I'm telling you who the hell it is!
74) 7) dialog: Dammit, Joan!! She steps out of the closet and comes toward the bedroom, dressed in one of Andy's negligees.
74) 9) dialog: You can mention anything you want,                     * honey. I'm just trying to keep you from turning up face down, that's all. After a moment:
74) 10) dialog: I mean, I can't leave you up here alone now... She moves toward the bed, aware of Harry staring at her.
74) 12) dialog: It's very becoming on you. She sits down on the edge of the bed, looking over at him
74) 14) dialog: Yes you do. After a brief moment:

78) 0) text: Duke follows Harry's every movement, as he engages in a deft, professional search of the bedroom. He goes through the bureau drawers, the closet shelves, a pair of suitcases, then crosses to one of the two nightstands. Finding nothing in the drawer, he moves around to its mate on the other side of the bed.
78) 1) dialog: He opens the drawer, glances inside and starts to close it when he sees:

In the b.g., Harry's van can be seen in the driveway, and presently he appears from the side of the house, carrying a suitcase and a few items of clothes. As he moves to the van and opens the door, her attention is drawn to him:
