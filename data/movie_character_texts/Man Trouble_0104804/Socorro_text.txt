She resumes playing until her attention is once again drawn to the window, where a middle-aged Hispanic woman SOCORRO moves past in the opposite direction with a young man, who now carries a suitcase. She rises and crosses to the windows to see them get into a gaudy low-rider and begin backing down th driveway.
