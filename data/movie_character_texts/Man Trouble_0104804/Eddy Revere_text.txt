35) 4) dialog: Don't do what?
35) 6) dialog: You have a dog you can't look in the eye, Joan?
35) 8) dialog: Oh... He steps back from the dog as Joan leans down to give Duke some water from the cup.
35) 10) dialog: You don't have to go to all this trouble, I've offered to stay up at your sister's with you?
35) 12) dialog: God, you're stubborn, Joan.
35) 17) dialog: But you won't tell me what's really bothering you. Why don't you confide in me anymore?
35) 19) dialog: No you don't. Come on, talk to me. Let's go have a drink after rehearsal.
35) 23) dialog: I'm coming...! (then to Joan) How about tomorrow night then?
35) 25) dialog: (slightly annoyed) Well don't go out of your way, Joan.
42) 0) text: Joan and Lewie stand in the doorway of the      rehearsal room. (A portion of the Chorus Membership       are seate chairs, and some, including Eddy Revere and      Helen, s occasional interest in the intense exchange      taking p at the door:)
114) 7) text: Eddy steps INTO FRAME:
114) 8) dialog: I can take her home.
116) 0) text: ON Eddy's Jeep as it moves through one of the seedier sections of the city. Joan stares sadly out the window. Then:
116) 3) dialog: And the milkman's a child molester.
116) 6) dialog: Well, it's true. It doesn't matter where you live. Shit happens.
116) 8) dialog: No. I'm not in a bad mood.   Not as bad as yours.
117) 3) text: A sports car is in between the van and Eddy's Jeep. From the higher vantage point of the van, he has a clear view through the rear window of Eddy's Jeep and just before it makes a right-hand turn onto a northbound street, Joan can be seen leaning over to Eddy, placing her face close to his.
118) 0) text: Further up the winding road a car passes him, obscuring his view of Eddy's Jeep.
119) 0) text: Eddy and Joan are now midway above the city. They drive in silence for a while, then he begins what seems to be a casual reminiscence.
119) 1) dialog: Remember when we were on tour in Japan, in '86?
119) 3) dialog: The night after we did a concert in Osaka?
119) 7) dialog: We had a few drinks in your room.                   * And a certain intimacy took place.
119) 9) dialog: And when I asked to see you the next                * night, you know what you said? You                  * were too tired and sleepy.
119) 11) dialog: But you weren't. Because an hour later, you went into Lewie's room and you didn't come out.
119) 13) dialog: That's not the reason.
119) 17) dialog: I just want to drive a little, so                   * we can talk.
119) 27) dialog: Somebody did.
124) 0) text: The Jeep pitches about on its shocks as it moves up an incline graded slightly higher than the one already giving Harry trouble. Eddy shifts into four-wheel. Joan, jostled about by the uneven surface beneath them, looks over at him:
124) 2) dialog: Because you deserved it.
124) 4) dialog: I use to think very highly of you, too, but now I don't like what I see. In fact, it's been very disturbing to me, Joan. (pauses, then)
125) 0) text: The wheels of the van loose traction. Harry gets out and looks up toward the taillights of Eddy's Jeep, disap- pearing in the hazy distance. He looks for a rock and finding one large enough, wedges it under one of the rear tires. Then he quickly gets back into the van.
127) 0) text: Eddy and Joan. Under the following, his hand reaches down to something lying out of sight to the left of the driver's seat:
127) 1) dialog: You know, there's so  many things about me you have no  idea of. You never ask me about my  life or what I'm thinking, because  you have no interest...
127) 3) dialog: Creative things, and dreams, and feelings I have, that Lewie or anyone else in your life, are not capable of... She suddenly reaches frantically to the door handle and tries to get out. He grabs hold of her arm and pulls her back into the seat:
127) 4) dialog: See? You're not genuinely interested. You're not at all sincere, Joan.
127) 6) dialog: You present yourself like you are, but you're not... (moves his face closer to hers)
127) 11) dialog: I want you to listen to me, and I                      * want you to kiss me. And this time, like you mean it...
128) 2) text: He reaches in and pulls Eddy away from Joan.
128) 4) text: The warning is simultaneous with an attempt by Eddy to stab him with the knife.
128) 6) text: He grabs Eddy's arm and in hauling him out of the car, rips loose the sleeve of Eddy's shirt.
129) 11) text: The search beam of the COPTER spotlights Joan. She is bent over, picking up sticks and stones and as if routing a deadly enemy, she begins hurling them, as well as a series of invectives, at the lights of the city below, her words barely audible over the sound of the ROTORS. The beam sweeps from her, to pick up Harry and Eddy and an AMPLIFIED, God-like voice comes from above:
129) 13) text: Joan turns back to Harry. He holds the now unconscious Eddy by his shirt front and resuming his accusations, starts to move toward Joan:
133) 0) text: MUSIC OVER: Shadows from a barred window are cast onto the wall behind Butch Gable and Eddy Revere, who sit sulky and disinterested in the MFCC's cheerful Therapy Hour Rap.
