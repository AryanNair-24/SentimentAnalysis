8) 0) text: Joan, moving with nervous alert, approaches a Mercedes sedan parked next to an Econoline van. Placing her key in the lock, she notes a flyer on her windshield. She removes it, glancing briefly at this heading in bold type: WOMEN - DON'T LIVE IN FEAR. A low RUMBLING sound causes her to lift her gaze over the top of the car, where an attack shepherd (DUKE), slowly unsheathes his teeth and fixes her with a threatening stare through the closed window of the van. Her eyes drop down to the legend on its door panel: House of Bliss Shepherds - Peace of mind - Twenty-Four Hours A Day - Call 7-A-T-T-A-C-K. MAN TROUBLE - Rev. 4/22/91                             6.

15) 0) text: Joan stands briefly in the dark, apprehending something untoward. She reaches to a wall switch, turns on the lights and sees: The living room has been completely savaged. Pictures have been pulled from the walls, books have been swept from the shelves, chairs are upended and area rugs lie rumpled and dislocated. A vase of flowers atop a grand piano is overturned and water from it stains the polished surface. Her gaze moves to a bank of windows overlooking a garden patio. The glass pane in one of them is broken and the window stands partly open. ON Joan's stunned reaction as she fearfully scans the room. Then she suddenly reaches to the front door, opens it and disappears into the hallway, shutting the door after her.
16) 0) text: A detective (MELVENOS) moves about, glancing at the devastation. Joan, seated on a couch, addresses him: (In the b.g., Helen Dextra stands on her crutches near th piano, and beyond her a FINGERPRINTER dusts for prints around the frame of the broken window.)
16) 2) dialog: No, nothing. That's what's so disturbing. I mean, why would someone do something like this...?
16) 6) dialog: What do you mean, somebody doesn't like me?
16) 11) dialog: You think this is someone I know?
16) 13) dialog: No.

16) 43) dialog: Helen Dextra, you've met her before.
16) 45) dialog: Read what? I don't know what you're talking about.

17) 1) dialog: I wanted to ask you, if there's somebody, who for some unknown reason, doesn't like me, what do you suggest I do?
17) 5) dialog: Really though, I don't see how this could be somebody I know.
17) 7) text: They start down the hallway and Joan addresses their backs:
17) 8) dialog: Because I actually go miles out of my way to avoid conflictual situations.
18) 3) text: Joan has reentered the room and approaches them.
18) 5) dialog: Andy, are you telling me the truth?
18) 10) dialog: I mean, are you really going to New York?
18) 12) dialog: Well maybe I could stay at your house while you're gone. So could you tell your housekeeper to...
18) 14) dialog: Pardon me, but I don't care what he said. My apartment, as you can                     * see, is a complete shambles, I have                   * a terrible headache, I've been                        * informed that somebody doesn't like me, and I really don't want to stay here by myself!

18) 17) dialog: Thank you.
20) 0) text: Joan is seated at the piano, playing Ravel's "Reverie." She breaks off as she sees a dark young man (BALTO) move past the living room window. She resumes playing until her attention is once again drawn to the window, where a middle-aged Hispanic woman SOCORRO moves past in the opposite direction with a young man, who now carries a suitcase. She rises and crosses to the windows to see them get into a gaudy low-rider and begin backing down th driveway.
21) 0) text: Joan hurries out of the house and runs down the drive- way toward the low-rider calling out:
21) 1) dialog: Socorro!! Wait a minute!   I want to talk to you!
21) 2) text: The Low-Rider comes to a stop. Joan approaches the pas- senger window and leans down to Socorro:
21) 3) dialog: Excuse me, Socorro, but do you mind if I ask what's happening, why are you leaving?
21) 5) dialog: I'm asking, where-are-you-going?
21) 9) dialog: Yes, what's going on, are you bringing her back later or what?
21) 11) dialog: Monday? But this is Thursday, I can't stay here alone 'til Monday.
21) 14) text: Joan straightens up, sighing angrily and looking up at the house:
21) 15) dialog: Well, this is just glorious.
21) 16) text: The low-rider moves down the driveway and as it disap- pears onto the street, Joan moves to an electric box atop a metal column at the edge of the driveway. She presses the button and looks at the gates. They remain open. She steps over to the gates and tries to close them manually. The locking device fails to engage and a portion of it falls off into the bushes.
21) 18) text: Giving up on the gates, Joan turns and moves with evident reluctance up the driveway, passing a three-car garage in which her Mercedes and another car hidden under a trap ca be seen. MAN TROUBLE - Rev. 4/23/91                           19.
22) 0) text: TRAILER MUSIC. Joan is asleep on the bed. Lying beside her is a fireplace poker and a mallet meat tenderizer. Across the dark room, a trailer of Blood and Kisses plays on the TV screen. The scantily-clad woman previously seen on the bus stop poster backs away from a steadily- stalking camera. Her eyes widen in the familiar expression of helpless terror and as she opens her mouth to scream: Joan flinches and sits up. She turns the TV OFF, which descends into a wooden console. At that moment, there is a VOICE from outside the bedroom window: BUTCH                                    *
22) 2) text: It's Butch! Get your ass in gear                       * and say hello to your old drinking buddy! She calls loudly out to him: JOAN

23) 0) text: Joan moves along the windows with her weapons in hand, watching as Butch wavers erratically up to the driveway where the previously seen pickup can be seen. She waits until he gets in and drives off, then she moves back into the bedroom.
24) 0) text: Joan, pacing about in nervous distress. She stops abruptly, throws her weapons onto the bed and moves purposively to her handbag. Rummaging through it, she finds the House of Bliss flyer, unfolds it and looks at the reassuring photograph of Harry and Duke.
25) 11) dialog: Oh god, what if I don't want him to do that?
25) 13) dialog: No, I just want him to scare someone.
25) 15) dialog: You know, I have an extremely sensitive reaction to dog dander, so maybe I shouldn't...
25) 20) dialog: I'm in the process of a divorce and I moved up here because my apartment was burglarized and... (suddenly mistrustful) But I'm not entirely alone, there's a housekeeper here, and several friends.

26) 7) dialog: (tense and distracted) It's not mine, it's my sister's.
26) 9) dialog: (looking down at Duke) Am I doing this right? Shouldn't I be prepared for something?
26) 13) dialog: Never look at your dog?    Okay.
26) 14) text: They move forward a few feet, when Harry, now slightly behind Joan, makes a covert hand signal in the direction of some trees several yards ahead of them. June, in a padded attack suit, suddenly jumps out from behind the trees, assuming an aggressive stance and emitting a repertory of menacing sounds. JOAN                       HARRY
26) 15) text: Oh my God!                               Duke, fasse! Duke responds immediately, lunging toward June, pulling Joan along with him. June screams and starts to run away. Harry moves after Joan, yelling ahead to June:
26) 17) text: Seeing the dog still in pursuit, June ignores the command and as Duke continues to tow Joan behind him:
26) 19) dialog: I am... (struggling with Duke) Good boy, be nice.
26) 21) dialog: I forgot it!     You tell him!   Duke, stop!
26) 24) text: The dog instantly assumes a sitting position. Joan, out of breath and exhilarated with fear and excitement, turns to Harry:
26) 27) dialog: My golly, that was incredible. I                      * love this dog. Did you see that?                      * I can't believe how strong he is.                     * I felt like a rag doll...                             *
27) 4) dialog: Yes, that's her, with her third husband, Eric Ellerman.
27) 6) dialog: Yes.

28) 6) dialog: And would you also thank your...
30) 0) text: Joan, her mood light-hearted, enters, with Duke following. She crosses to the closet, selects a change of clothes and moves to lay them out on the bed.

35) 3) dialog: Don't do that. He turns to see Joan approaching with a paper cup filled with water.
35) 5) dialog: You're not supposed to look him straight in the eye.
35) 7) dialog: He's not just a dog. He's a Schutzhund trained attack dog.
35) 9) dialog: I was told to avoid a direct gaze and always look at the base of the right or the left ear.

38) 5) dialog: You know that part? 'Yet as a wheel moves smoothly, free from jars, My will and my desire were turned by love, The love that moves the sun and other stars.'
38) 6) text: He nods, while Joan, hoping to disguise the extent of her emotions, looks down and begins moving her wine in circles:

39) 0) text: Joan and Harry come down the steps of the Inn. The sun has gone down and the lights of the city have come on. Under the following they cross the driveway to a low fence railing off an Oriental garden.
39) 1) dialog: You know, it's very sad. I look at my sister and all her marriages and affairs, not to mention the mess my own life is in, and I think it's very sad and very bleak that men and women can't manage to be friends.
39) 3) dialog: What a tragedy that sex is often such a barrier to friendship between men and women.
39) 5) dialog: You know Dante and Beatrice never slept together.
39) 8) dialog: Well, anyway... I shouldn't have had so much wine... because I prefer to go a little slow here.

45) 11) dialog: I think I should say something.
45) 13) dialog: That's the problem though, I want to be honest with you...
45) 16) dialog: Because I recently realized something about myself. That I've slept with a number of men in my life just because I didn't want them not to like me.
45) 18) dialog: But the thing is, I didn't like most of them that much, so why did I care whether they liked me or not?
45) 20) dialog: Oh, I know, that's not what I'm saying...
45) 22) dialog: What I'm saying is I don't know if right now I might not go to bed with you because I don't want to be alone, so I thought maybe we... could try to explore other modes, or...
45) 26) dialog: I mean, there are other ways of being intimate, that people don't even realize.
45) 28) dialog: Which doesn't mean I'm not attracted to you.
