4) 6) dialog: And when they told him they didn't have access to animals...that was also a lie.
5) 1) dialog: The hundred goats in the disused hospital building had been secretly flown in from Central America so as to avoid customs. Special Forces weren't worried about the General hearing the goats because they'd been de- bleated.
5) 3) dialog: This is the story of those goats.

6) 14) dialog: He's the man who died.
7) 0) text: Bob is clearing Ron's desk, putting his possessions into a box.
7) 1) dialog: My wife, Debora, told me later that Ron's death had been like a wake-up call for her - what people used to call a memento mori.
7) 2) text: Bob sits down, feeling a little ghoulish, at the dead man's desk. He notices a large INDENTATION on the leather in front of him - the mark left by Ron's forehead. He touches it, fascinated.
7) 3) dialog: That massive coronary had reminded her that life was too short to waste any chance of true happiness.
7) 4) text: Bob rests his own forehead, experimentally, onto the indentation, and sits there, face down on the desk. His eyes wander over to where Dave and Debora are talking in Dave's office. BOB'S P.O.V - Debora's hand BRUSHES against Dave's, LINGERS just a fraction too long. Bob frowns.

8) 7) text: Bob wipes his eyes, stares at the screen.
8) 8) dialog: Had I known where that path would lead, had a soft wind from my future brought me the name of Bill Django, I might never have gone. But as it was, I did what so many men have done throughout history when a woman has broken their heart... I went to war.

12) 10) text: Bob reads the logo on the baseball cap.
12) 24) text: The man considers this. He looks up and we see his face for the first time - handsome, older than Bob, tanned, a moustache, a slightly haunted expression. This is LYN CASSADY.
12) 26) text: Bob waits for more, but that's it. He holds out his hand.
12) 31) text: Lyn shoves the packet across the table. Bob sits down across from him, pats himself down for a lighter, glances over to where the two embedded Journalists are joking with some Marines. Bob watches them jealously.
12) 33) text: Suddenly the TERRACE LIGHT above them flickers and goes out. Lyn and Bob sit in the dark.
12) 36) text: A LIGHTER ignites in Lyn's hand, eerily lighting the lower half of his face, his eyes hidden by the brim of the cap. Bob leans forward to light his cigarette and finds himself staring at the CONFERENCE I.D Lyn has pinned to his shirt. The name on the badge reads LYN S. CASSADY.

16) 1) dialog: Whoa!
16) 3) dialog: Hooper? No. I work for the Ann Arbor Daily Telegram.
16) 5) dialog: I interviewed him a few years ago. He'd been appearing on this radio talk show.
16) 8) dialog: He said he joined Bill Django's unit in the army and was trained to, to, uh remote view?

17) 42) dialog: What about you?
17) 45) dialog: Yeah? (Beat) Like who?

17) 59) dialog: Actual invisibility?
17) 61) text: Bob tries to follow this.
17) 62) dialog: Like camouflage?
17) 66) text: Bob watches him solemnly as he continues his weird panting.
17) 67) dialog: I don't...can I be honest, Lyn? I don't know what to make of this. I don't know what to say. This is amazing stuff. (Beat) How would you...I wanna...could I write a story about this?
17) 75) dialog: No, but see, I've been looking for a story Lyn. I was going to write about the re-build contracts but this...this is even better and I...
17) 78) dialog: All I'm saying is we could talk some more tomorrow and...
17) 80) dialog: You're going home?
17) 82) text: Bob's face falls.
17) 84) text: They sit in silence for a moment. Lyn passes Bob the whiskey. He takes a swig, his mind whirring...
17) 85) dialog: 
17) 89) dialog: I could come with you, maybe, and...
17) 91) dialog: No, listen, we could change names, stuff could stay off record and...
17) 102) text: Bob flushes with annoyance.
17) 103) dialog: Well you know, you don't... I look after myself. Okay? I look after...And I've been in some pretty hairy situations before. I'm not, you know...I'm a journalist, Lyn. You understand?
17) 105) dialog: A journalist. I go where the story is.
17) 106) dialog: I was an American. I was Resolute. I wanted adversity to reveal my character to the world. And to my wife. And to that one-armed cunt Dave.
17) 107) text: Lyn is staring at Bob's notebook. He takes it from Bob and examines Bob's DRAWINGS OF EYES.
17) 109) dialog: What? Nothing. I was just doodling.
17) 110) text: Lyn examines Bob - something DIFFERENT IN HIS ATTITUDE.
17) 111) dialog: What's the matter?
17) 114) text: He considers for a moment, struggling with himself, then seems to reluctantly come to a decision. He reaches into the bag on his bed and pulls out a dog-eared BOOK. He hands it to Bob. Bob examines the book - on the cover is a picture of Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man and the title Pentagon Report 92245. The New Earth Army Manual. Bob stares at the book. He opens the first page and reads...

24) 1) dialog: What Bill hadn't told the Pentagon was that he was really looking for the answer to the riddle of his vision. How could his men's gentleness, their general lack of interest in killing people, how could this be turned into a strength? How could love and peace help win wars? Bill knew where to go to find out.
31) 5) text: ARROWS POINT at various MEDITATORS around the hall, identifying them as BOB DYLAN, GEORGE HARRISON and HENRY MILLER. Bill senses someone staring at him and glances over to the Meditator next to him - Aviator shades, a baseball cap pulled low, empty cigarette holder clenched between his teeth. The Meditator continues to stare intently at him. Then opens his coat to reveal the Magnum .45 strapped to his chest. Bill smiles nervously. An ARROW identifies the gunman as HUNTER S. THOMPSON.

36) 6) text: Lyn injects himself, packs everything back away in his back-pack. Bob sits, shivering. Lyn finishes, stares up at the stars thoughtfully.
43) 0) text: Bob wakes, stiff and cold, in the front of the car. He sits up and looks around, trying to work out where he is. Suddenly he realizes he is ALONE. Afraid, he scans the landscape around him - featureless desert stretches to the horizon.

45) 9) text: Bob tries to work out which cloud he means.
45) 13) text: Lyn looks at Bob like he's crazy.
45) 21) text: He concentrates on the CLOUD again. Sure enough, it thins and fades until it has DISAPPEARED. Bob stares - not sure what to think.
45) 23) text: Lyn, smiling up at the sky, doesn't notice that the car is veering off the road a little. BANG! The two men are slammed forward as the car hits something, Bob smacking his face off the dash.
46) 0) text: We see the car has run straight into a large ROCK. This is pretty much the only vertical feature in the otherwise flat landscape. The two men stand staring at the wrecked front of the car. Bob is holding a handkerchief to his bloody nose. He looks at the car, stares around him at the desert stretching out.
47) 0) text: A sweating Bob sits in the shadow of the car, tossing a COIN. Lyn sits smoking.
47) 22) text: Bob scuttles into the middle of the road, waving frantically. The pick-up slows and pulls over. A YOUNG IRAQI MAN looks out at them.
47) 27) text: He grabs his case and climbs up onto the back of the truck. Lyn stares at the driver, then, with a sigh picks up his bag and follows Bob.
48) 0) text: Bob and Lyn, their hands tied, sit on a mattress in the otherwise empty room, lit by a shaft of moonlight from the small window above them. From next door comes the faint sound of a period song playing. Bob is losing it.
48) 13) text: Bob collapses face down on the mattress.
48) 24) text: He unbuttons his shirt and reveals an EYE tattooed on his chest - very similar to the one Bob had drawn. Bob looks up.
48) 26) text: Bob stares at the EYE.
48) 28) dialog: How are we gonna stop them? There's three of them! And they've got guns!
48) 30) dialog: What do you mean?
48) 32) dialog: 
48) 41) text: Bob thinks about this, a little nauseated.
48) 42) dialog: We haven't got a pen.
48) 45) text: Bob stands up reluctantly.
48) 47) dialog: Oh...I don't want to Lyn.
48) 49) dialog: I don't think I...there's sharp edges around here...
48) 51) text: Bob stares at him, a little annoyed by this.
48) 52) dialog: What's with the quotation fingers? That's like implying I'm you know...only capable of ironic attacking or...
48) 54) dialog: 
48) 62) text: Bob thinks about this then raises his hands to choke Lyn. Lyn THROWS him - sailing through the air. He crashes down into the floor behind Lyn.
48) 64) dialog: (in pain) Sharp...edges...
48) 66) text: Bob massages his back, impressed despite himself.
48) 67) dialog: Yes.
48) 69) text: Bob thinks about this.
48) 70) dialog: I don't know. I was pretty terrified anyway but the fear I felt on the run-up to the choking did seem, you know, unusual.
49) 0) text: The White Pick-Up bounces over the sand. Bob and Lyn sit in the back with one of the Young Iraqis, who has Lyn's back-pack.
49) 1) dialog: 
49) 33) text: Bob considers this.
49) 34) dialog: Yes. Yes I have.
49) 36) dialog: Have you always had powers?
49) 38) dialog: Why?
70) 1) dialog: Larry made it quite clear that he despised most of the other Jedis.
70) 3) dialog: But Lyn - Lyn was different. (Beat) He really hated Lyn.
76) 1) dialog: The word soon got out in the intelligence community that there was a sergeant at Fort Bragg who could find whatever you needed found. It was as if Lyn could fly anywhere in the world without leaving his room.
76) 3) dialog: As Bill Django said - the Force truly was strong with this one.
77) 5) dialog: Lyn?
77) 22) text: The Young Iraqi points the gun at Bob who starts to walk towards the truck.
77) 25) text: Bob stops.
77) 29) text: Apparently having had enough one the Insurgents pulls his own GUN out and aims at Lyn. The tension builds. Suddenly Bob remembers the phrase he was taught.
77) 36) text: Immediately everyone stares at Bob. The Insurgent OPENS FIRE at him. Terrified Bob, dives across the sand. The Young Iraqi behind him also scrambles for cover. Still firing, the Insurgent is suddenly aware of Lyn sprinting towards him. Before he can turn to aim at him, Lyn LEAPS into the air, spinning around, face contorted as he emits a bizarre SHRIEK. We FREEZE-FRAME ON HIM, HUNG IN MID-AIR.
77) 37) dialog: Now at the time I thought Lyn was having some kind of fit here. Later I discovered what he was actually doing was performing the Echmeyer technique.
78) 1) dialog: Ben Echmeyer was a Vietnam vet with sixty-three confirmed kills. He remains the only non-Korean to achieve the rank of Master in Kwa Ra Do. He was one of the Jedi teachers at Fort Bragg.
78) 3) dialog: It was said he could have a tug of war with a dozen men and not move an inch.
78) 5) dialog: He was also able to lift bags of sand on hooks hung through his scrotum.
81) 0) text: We UN-FREEZE ON LYN - as he whirls and shrieks towards the Insurgent. Bob watches amazed from where he lies on the sand.
81) 1) dialog: Of course, Lyn didn't actually have a knife with him at this particular time...so I still think what he did was kinda...reckless.
82) 2) dialog: (pulling his head back in) They're not coming! We're okay! Oh God, we're gonna be okay!
83) 2) text: Bob gets out and the two lift the Iraqi Man and begin to carry him back towards the truck. They stop listening to an approaching rumble.
83) 4) text: They scuttle faster back towards the truck, the Iraqi Man dangling between them. Next second, two GLEAMING WHITE SUVs crest the hill and roar towards them. Seeing the road blocked by the truck, the SUVs screech to a halt and several MEN IN FLAK JACKETS AND SUNGLASSES tumble out in formation, aiming their M-16's at Lyn and Bob. ARMED MEN'S P.O.V - Lyn and Bob stare at them before dropping the bound Iraqi on the ground. Bob waves nervously.
84) 3) text: Bob and the Iraqi Man sit beside TODD NIXON - a suit. Lyn sits behind in between two of the PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS, who are nodding along to the music playing in the car. Nixon, holding the LAPTOP for Bob to see, watches the screen, moved.
84) 29) text: Bob nods politely.
86) 2) text: The men fan out to the corners of the station, while the first SUV blocks the road and more SECURITY pile out, guns raised to cover the line of cars. There are howls of protest from the waiting Iraqis. Inside the SUV Bob, Lyn and Mahmud watch in astonishment.
86) 36) text: Mahmud, Bob and Lyn are lying flat on the seats.
86) 38) text: Bob flinches as another bullet ricochets off the SUV.
86) 44) text: Behind him Lyn, Bob and Mahmud crawl across the station on their hands and knees, bullets zipping past them.
87) 0) text: Mahmud leads Bob and Lyn at a crouching run down the street, amongst the crowd of Iraqis fleeing the gunfire behind them. We hear the whup-whup of a helicopter as a Kiowa Warrior passes over head. Moments later we hear an EXPLOSION as the helicopter opens fire with a MISSILE...
88) 11) text: We reach Bob, Lyn and Mahmud eating at a low table. The windows behind them have been partially boarded up. Mahmud is sunk into a profound depression. Lyn looks tired, pale. They eat in awkward silence.
88) 15) text: Bob nods politely. Mahmud nods, sighs.
88) 36) text: The men eat in silence for a moment. Mahmud stares blankly at his plate, looking crumpled and lost. Bob watches him, faintly irritated. Lyn tries to think of something comforting to say.
89) 0) text: Lyn and Bob are sharing a bed. Bob looks out of the window and notices a CLOUD over the moon. He concentrates on it, trying to "bust" it. Nothing happens. He sighs, looks over to Lyn who is staring at the wall, lost once more in dark thoughts.
89) 1) dialog: Lyn?
89) 3) dialog: What are you thinking?
90) 1) dialog: Lyn was thinking of Larry Hooper and the part he had played in the destruction of the New earth Army. But, in fairness, the Jedis' own eccentricities hadn't exactly won them many allies in the Army.
90) 3) dialog: For example, there was Tim Kootz who, on being asked to ascertain the whereabouts of General Manuel Noriega, had replied...
100) 1) dialog: After Bill left, Major Holtz of Special Forces took command of the Jedis.
100) 3) dialog: And nothing was ever the same again.
101) 0) text: Bob wakes up, listening to the sound of Lyn's laboured breathing. Across the room Lyn sits, sweating with pain, preparing an injection. We see he has used the LAST OF THE MEDICINE. He injects himself, his breathing beginning to ease and sits staring at the empty VIAL. Bob watches for a moment then shuts his eyes, feigning sleep.
102) 0) text: Lyn and Bob are waiting on the quiet road which is studded with burnt out CARS. Mahmud drives an old Renault out of a warehouse and over to them. He gets out the car and hands Lyn the keys.
105) 3) dialog: 
105) 8) dialog: 
105) 11) dialog: Oh for the love of...Here...
105) 12) text: He gives Lyn his watch. Lyn looks at the watch and turns to stare at Bob.

105) 30) text: Bob stares at him.
107) 0) text: BOB's P.O.V - We are stumbling forward towards a sand berm. We hear the sound of heavy breathing.
107) 3) text: Lyn is staggering over the sand with Bob on his back. He is holding his backpack. Bob has a gash on his forehead which is bleeding. Under the blood his face is white. In the distance, behind them, we can see the column of black smoke rising.
107) 12) text: Lyn puts Bob down. Bob keels sideways onto the sand and lies there, wheezing.
107) 15) text: He hauls Bob to his feet, puts his baseball cap on him and pulls him onto his back. Bob hangs there limply as Lyn sets off again.
107) 20) text: Lyn reaches up and gropes at Bob's face, removing his spectacles. Bob doesn't notice.
107) 25) text: He passes Bob his backpack. They stagger on in silence for a moment, Bob jogging up and down on Lyn's back. Lyn snaps the legs off Bob's glasses, uses them as improvised divining rods to scan the sand ahead.
108) 0) text: Bob trails after Lyn, his shirt tied around his head, breathing hard. Lyn is still scanning the sand.
108) 1) dialog: I can't breathe properly. I can't...Oh boy...
108) 4) dialog: I think I'm bleeding to death.
108) 6) dialog: If we'd stayed at the road we would be safe now! Now we've got no water, no food or, or... (noticing Lyn's scanning) Will you forget about the fucking tantric currents?
108) 9) dialog: Stop saying that! I just got blown up! I'm in the middle of a desert! I'M NOT GONNA BE OKAY!
108) 11) text: Bob stares after him incredulously.
108) 12) dialog: (losing it) Is that...is that supposed to calm me down?! (hurrying after him) You know what color the seats were in the frigging hotel but you can't...you wanna observe something Lyn? Observe the fucking bomb in the middle of the road!
108) 18) text: Lyn walks on without answering. Bob notices the sun is sinking.
108) 26) text: Bob watches Lyn stare around him, looking pale and drawn and, for the first time, afraid.
108) 31) text: Bob is so staggered by this for a moment he can't speak.
108) 41) dialog: Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus Lyn. There's no mission? We're in the middle of the desert because you heard voices? There's no one here! There's no-one fucking here.
108) 43) dialog: Lyn!
108) 44) text: Bob rushes to him, kneels beside him. Lyn clutches his stomach, grimaces.
108) 45) dialog: Is it the Crohns?
108) 47) dialog: What's the matter with you?
108) 49) text: Bob stares at him, stunned.
109) 0) text: Lyn sits staring up at the immense MOON above them. Bob sits watching, huddled against the cold, in the shelter of some rocks. Lyn gets up, stumbles back over to him and lies down, struggling for breath, white with pain.
109) 2) dialog: What curse?
113) 1) dialog: ...whereas the army had long felt fine about doing stuff to goats - even testing atomic weapons on them.
115) 0) text: Bob listens transfixed.
115) 4) dialog: So, it's not that the goat fought back?
115) 7) dialog: But...that was it?

122) 0) text: Bob stares at Lyn aghast.
122) 3) text: Bob shakes his head, stares out into the darkness.
122) 12) text: Lyn flicks a suspicious glance at Bob, but is reassured by his solemn expression.
124) 0) text: Bob looks at Lyn, puzzled.
124) 15) text: He flops back, too tired to talk anymore. Bob watches him as he falls asleep.
125) 0) text: The same horizon, the dunes now burning under the sun. We TRACK back and find Bob and Lyn lying asleep, lips cracked, dehydrated, exhausted. Faintly we hear a sound - a tinny BELL. It gets closer. Groggily Bob opens his eyes just as a GOAT walks into the frame and walks past him, the bell tied around its neck. Bob lies, watching it pass, trying to work out if it's a hallucination. He struggles to his feet and sets off up the berm he's been lying at the foot of. The goat walks on ahead of Bob, crests the top of the berm and disappears from sight. Bob reaches the top of the berm and stands, swaying, staring down at something. CLOSE ON BOB'S FACE - stunned.
