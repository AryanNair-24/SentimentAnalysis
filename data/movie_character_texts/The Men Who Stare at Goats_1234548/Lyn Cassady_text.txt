12) 24) text: The man considers this. He looks up and we see his face for the first time - handsome, older than Bob, tanned, a moustache, a slightly haunted expression. This is LYN CASSADY.
14) 81) text: BOB'S NOTEBOOK - as he writes down the name LYN CASSADY...
16) 2) dialog: You working for Hooper?
16) 4) dialog: How do you know about Lacey?
16) 7) dialog: Little prick...what'd he tell you?
17) 32) dialog: Soldiers with Super Powers. We were the first generation of the New Earth Army.
17) 35) dialog: That's correct.
17) 39) dialog: We prefer the term Remote Viewer.
17) 41) dialog: Different Jedi had different techniques. Mel Landau used to visualize packing all his cares and worries in a little suitcase, to clear his mind. Steve Cuttle used to read Bible verse...
17) 44) dialog: Well, I find drinking helps. Also if I'm listening to classic rock music.
17) 46) dialog: I like Boston. Boston usually works.
17) 56) dialog: Invisibility.
17) 58) dialog: Yup. That was Level Three.
17) 60) dialog: Well...yeah, that was the goal. But after a while we adapted it to just finding a way of not being seen. When you understand the, the linkage between observation and reality, you learn to dance with invisibility.
17) 63) dialog: It's not like camouflage. We also practised Phasing. Crossing from particle to wave, from the physical realm to the plane of energy. Solid objects seem to pass right through you. It's starts with a breathing exercise...
17) 65) dialog: Then you think black. That's the nothingness.
17) 69) dialog: Not going to happen.
17) 77) dialog: Not going to happen.
17) 79) dialog: I'm shipping out tomorrow.
17) 81) dialog: Going to Iraq. There's this factory we might be partnering with in Al Qaim.
17) 90) dialog: Bob, I don't want to be a story, okay? I don't need the attention and...
17) 101) dialog: It's a war over there Bob. Okay? A war. I can't be looking out for you.
17) 108) dialog: What's this?
17) 112) dialog: 
17) 126) dialog: You wanted to know who Bill Django was? (Beat) He's the man who wrote that book.
33) 33) dialog: The New Earth Army was tasked with preventing conflict. We're a force of peace, not war. Bill realized if you want to change the world, you've got to start by changing the armies. He was the one that started the research into non- lethals.
33) 36) dialog: Check this out.
33) 38) dialog: The Predator.
33) 43) dialog: You see? You're mine now. The Predator is completely biodegradable. It's friendly to the earth but it can hurt you in a hundred ways.
33) 46) dialog: It has warrior functions.(Beat) And it looks a bit funny. This is New Earth Army technology.
33) 57) dialog: I bought it on line. What's cool about it is that you could see this lying on the ground and you'd never know it had such lethality.
33) 59) dialog: Eyeballs.
35) 3) dialog: 
36) 1) dialog: (Off Bob's look) ) I've got Crohn's. The steroids help.
48) 23) dialog: Like those doodles you just "happened" to draw?
48) 25) dialog: This is the Ajna chakra - the third eye - the symbol of the Jedi. When I saw you'd drawn it...well, the Universe gives me a sign like that, I don't ignore it. You're meant to be here with me, Bob. The Jedi inside you sensed that.
48) 27) dialog: Now listen to me. I don't think these guys are FRL's or Mehdi Army... I think we're talking standard criminals here, okay? What they're gonna do is try and sell us on to another group. We can't let that happen.
48) 29) dialog: We're Jedi, Bob. The Jedi don't fight with guns. We fight with our minds.
48) 31) dialog: Let's say we have no choice but to fight with these men. Then we use visual aesthetics to instill psychically in the enemy a disincentive to attack.
48) 34) dialog: Okay, you lock eyes with one of them, you go into a monotone and you say "No, I'm not going to attack you." You totally relax your body and your voice. And then you rip out one of his eyeballs.
48) 40) dialog: Or you use a pen, stab him in the neck, create a fountain of blood, I mean really a fountain, get the blood to squirt on his buddies. That's a psychic disincentive, right there.
48) 43) dialog: 
48) 46) dialog: Choke me.
48) 48) dialog: Choke me. What am I gonna do? (pointing at his throat) Just here. Choke. Choke.
48) 50) dialog: C'mon...(making quotation marks with his fingers) "Attack me."
48) 53) dialog: Quit jawing, Bob, and choke me.
48) 56) dialog: I'm going to interrupt your thought pattern.
48) 63) dialog: See? I hardly moved. Physics wise there's not much going on. It's the psychic energy that's important. (Beat) You okay?
48) 65) dialog: (helping him up) You felt fear didn't you? Before hand?
48) 68) dialog: Would you say that level of fear was abnormal for you?
48) 71) dialog: 
49) 32) dialog: Don't you? Haven't you always really felt you were different?
49) 35) dialog: That's the way it is for us. We're the ones who don't fit in as kids.
49) 37) dialog: Kind of. They used to call me the Jinx.
53) 4) dialog: Lyn Cassady sir.
53) 6) dialog: Opelousas, Louisiana, sir.
53) 11) dialog: 
71) 9) dialog: It's a man on a chair.
82) 4) dialog: There he is.
84) 40) dialog: 
84) 44) dialog: Right.
88) 35) dialog: Not your fault sir. I mean we get kidnappers in America too, so...you know. There's always, uh, bad apples, right?
88) 37) dialog: 
88) 40) dialog: Did I say it wrong?
89) 2) dialog: What?
89) 4) dialog: Just Mahmud. People try to build something of their lives, something lasting, something good... but there's always someone wants to smash it up...
102) 1) dialog: I really appreciate this sir.
105) 5) dialog: Bedouins have been navigating this desert for centuries without maps. You can use a wrist-watch in conjunction with the sun.
105) 10) dialog: I haven't got a watch.
105) 14) dialog: This is a digital watch, Bob.
105) 16) dialog: So you need a watch with hands for Christ's sake!
108) 3) dialog: You're okay.
108) 5) dialog: You're not bleeding to death, Bob. It's shock, okay? It's just the shock. It'll pass. You're gonna be okay.
108) 7) dialog: 
108) 10) dialog: Bob, you're suffering from shock. If you start panicking now your heart's gonna stop.
108) 46) dialog: I don't have Crohns.
108) 48) dialog: I'm dying.
108) 50) dialog: I've been murdered.
109) 1) dialog: It's gone Bob. I can't find him. I've lost my power. It's the curse.
109) 3) dialog: (With profound
115) 1) dialog: This was the real deal, Bob. I was at the Gateway. Afterwards I realized I'd got injured.
115) 3) dialog: Sympathetic injury I guess. I was bruised all over.
115) 5) dialog: 
131) 35) dialog: (To Bill) You're working for him?
133) 6) dialog: It's the Dark Side.
134) 4) dialog: It's too late...I'm dying, Bob.
136) 4) dialog: 
136) 7) dialog: I told you. I remote viewed you.
136) 10) dialog: No.
136) 12) dialog: I haven't seen Scotty.
150) 1) dialog: 
150) 9) dialog: (Beat, relieved) Okay, let's go.
150) 12) dialog: We're very sorry. Ma'assalama.
