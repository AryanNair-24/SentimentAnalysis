22) 25) text: Bullets still flying above her head, the Woman stops running, crouches down and RETURNS FIRE. Bill is SHOT, stumbles backwards and falls into the mud, his finger still stuck in his M-16. He lies there, staring up at the sky, his expression one of puzzlement, as a huge blood stain spreads over his chest. BILL'S P.O.V - the edges of our vision darken down as the sound FADES OUT. The darkness flows inwards, as if an IRIS IS CLOSING DOWN - until only a PIN-POINT OF WHITE LIGHT remains in the centre of the sky. We begin to move towards the light, slowly at first and then faster and faster. Just as we are about to reach it, a VISION OF THE FACE OF the VC WOMAN appears, filling the white disc.
