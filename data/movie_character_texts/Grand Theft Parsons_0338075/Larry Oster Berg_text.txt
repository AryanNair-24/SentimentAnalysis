4) 451) text: A man is sitting cross-legged on the floor. A joss stick burns beside him, and sitar music plays in the background This is LARRY OSTERBERG, and he is meditating. There is a loud hammering on the door. Larry shows no sign of having heard anything. More hammering at the door, but still no response. Then the letter box creaks open and an eye appears in the slot. After a moment, the eye disappears and Phil's face appears momentarily at the window. The window seems to be slightly higher than Phil, so his face appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room.
4) 454) text: Then Phil is gone. Larry expels a big breath. The letterbox creaks opens again and the eye is back.
4) 457) text: Larry sighs, and stretches. He gets up slowly, gently shakes himself to relax his muscles and walks to the door which he opens.
4) 459) dialog: The door is unlocked.
4) 463) dialog: Yes.   Welcome to my house.
4) 468) dialog: Manomanjari on the sitar by Nikhil Banerjee. (NB. Similar music may be used in this scene) Phil stares at him.
4) 476) dialog: There's no smoking in here, I'm afraid.
4) 480) dialog: Who are you, please?
4) 484) dialog: And how may I help you, Phil Kaufman?
4) 488) dialog: Why?
4) 491) dialog: Don't you know anyone with a car?
4) 495) dialog: I see. In what way is my car more suitable?
4) 499) dialog: Yes.
4) 500) text: They both look at each other.         Larry waits for Phi speak.
4) 505) dialog: And how is a hearse going to be suitable for picking someone up from the airport?
4) 509) dialog: A joke?
4) 513) dialog: Well, okay. Is it two hundred dollars worth of surprise?
4) 517) dialog: I can lend you a bicycle. Besides, the car is booked.
4) 525) text: Phil passes the money over.   Larry starts to count it.
4) 528) text: Larry doesn't pause counting.
4) 530) dialog: Let's see; I've never met you in my life, you shout through my mail slot, you want to hire my hearse as a joke, and...
4) 539) dialog: It's a hearse. What else do you need to know?
4) 542) text: The garage doors swing open and a hearse drives out into the sun. It is bright yellow and covered in painted flowers. One of the side windows is broken and a headligh hangs out. Phil's jaw drops open. Larry gets out of the driving seat and pats the roof, proudly.
4) 544) dialog: Meet Bernice.
4) 548) dialog: Bernice is a Cadillac Superior Royale Tiara Limousine Funeral Coach. We've got a Seven gallon V8 engine offering three hundred and forty bhp at four thousand six hundred revolutions per minute. You're looking at a twenty one feet beauty with a one hundred and fifty six inch wheelbase containing a four barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor with Turbo Hydramatic transmission. Bernice weighs over six thousand pounds.
4) 553) dialog: Yes, it's yellow.    Bernice comes in yellow.
4) 557) dialog: But they're all black.
4) 564) dialog: So how is a yellow hearse covered with flowers less of a surprise than a black hearse?
4) 568) dialog: (patiently) No, you paid me a hundred and eighty dollars for a hearse, and a hearse is what you've got. If you take a long, hard look at Bernice, you'll see that she's one of a kind. She's big, she's fast, she's comfortable, and she's beautiful. But she's not black.
4) 573) dialog: Why?
4) 576) text: Larry looks from Phil to Bernice and back again.
4) 578) dialog: Oh, no. She doesn't go anywhere without me.
4) 582) text: Larry runs across and closes the doors on a pile of amps and band equipment that now sits in the garage. Phil puts the guitar in the back seat and they get into the car.

5) 22) dialog: Okay.   How soon?
5) 26) dialog: Well... I don't know.
5) 29) dialog: Shouldn't we be at arrivals?
5) 33) dialog: Okay.
5) 36) dialog: So how long are we going to wait?
5) 37) text: Phil doesn't answer for a moment.      Just as Larry open mouth to ask again, Phil speaks.
5) 40) text: Larry looks at Phil with astonishment.
5) 45) dialog: Morning?   What do you mean, morning?
5) 48) text: Larry tries to start the car. Phil leans over and plucks the screwdriver from his hand. He reclines his seat and closes his eyes.
5) 50) dialog: You wait till morning.   I'm going home.
5) 51) text: Larry opens the door and gets out of the car. He slams th door shut behind him and stomps off into the gloom. Phil doesn't move.
6) 1) text: The drivers' door opens and Larry gets back into the car.
6) 3) dialog: I'm only back because I don't trust you with Bernice. I don't even know you, and if you think I'm going to leave my car with you and just walk away, then you've got another thought on the way.
6) 6) dialog: I'm staying right here. Where I can keep an eye on things...
6) 7) text: There is still no response from Phil. After a moment, Larry settles back in his seat and closes his eyes.

10) 59) dialog: That hearse?
10) 64) dialog: Okay?   Sure...
11) 50) text: Larry is standing by the hearse.          The cop is read license.
11) 53) dialog: Doing?    Here?
12) 19) text: Phil glances nervously out to where Larry is being interrogated by the cop. The clerk is reading a paper.
12) 23) text: Phil is distracted, watching the cop and Larry out of the window.
12) 74) text: The cop is wandering around the hearse.    Larry trails behind him, disconsolately.
12) 78) dialog: (miserably) No. Fair enough.

12) 87) dialog: We're meeting someone off a flight.

12) 103) dialog: Well... the first part.

13) 10) dialog: I didn't babble. I just... have a problem with authority.
13) 17) dialog: I don't like them and I don't know what to say to them. They make me feel uneasy.
13) 20) text: Larry sulks. Phil shakes his head and glances back at the cop and Larry crashes the car straight into the hangar wall.
13) 22) text: We pull back to reveal the enormous opening that Larry ha missed.
14) 5) dialog: I clipped it. I clipped the wall.
14) 9) dialog: (babbles) I was distracted. We're supposed to be picking someone up and you arrive with a coffin and I'd only just woken up and...
14) 13) text: The cop ignores him and concentrates on Larry.
14) 19) text: Larry swallows hard.
14) 21) dialog: Uh, not at this time, no sir.
14) 24) text: Larry licks his lips.
14) 25) dialog: Well...
14) 29) text: Still nothing. Larry looks like he's trying to form words but nothing emerges.

14) 63) text: Larry slams the brakes on and the huge car skids to a hal in a cloud of dust. Phil is flung forward in his seat.

14) 84) dialog: Why not?
14) 87) text: Larry slips the car into gear and it moves forward.
14) 90) text: Larry makes a U-turn.
14) 94) dialog: I'm driving back to the mortuary.
14) 97) text: Nearly at the turn now. Phil opens the car door with a mind to jump out, but one look at the fast-moving road changes his mind. He glowers at Larry and shuts the door. The hearse skids round the corner, Larry slams on the brakes and the car slides to a halt outside the mortuary.

14) 102) text: Larry gestures towards the back of the car.
14) 104) dialog: Who's the stiff?

16) 60) text: Larry slows the car down.
16) 64) dialog: Gas now.
16) 65) text: Larry pulls the car onto a Gas station forecourt.

17) 5) text: Larry turns to look at his reflection in the grimy mirror He is shaking.
17) 15) text: The man gapes at him. Larry walks over to the car and Phi gets into the passenger seat. He passes some money to the attendant and takes the can.
17) 20) text: Larry jiggles the screwdriver, slips Bernice into gear, a they're gone. The attendant watches them go.
17) 23) text: Larry is driving, Phil is looking out of the window.   Th are still in a built up area with cars around them.
17) 28) dialog: We could go back.
17) 32) dialog: I wasn't expecting a long trip. I haven't packed any spare clothes. We could pick up some supplies and drive out tomorrow.

17) 44) dialog: We could just...
17) 47) dialog: It would...
17) 51) dialog: 
17) 68) text: Phil is smoking. Larry is driving, his fingers tapping nervously on the wheel. He looks distracted and speaks to break the silence.
17) 70) dialog: I still don't fully understand what you do.
17) 73) dialog: Everything?
17) 77) dialog: Oh, one of those.   Like a well- paid gopher.
17) 80) text: Larry backs down with hint of sarcasm
17) 82) dialog: An executive nanny, not a gopher. Thanks for clearing that up.
17) 135) text: The hearse is parked by the side of the road, near a rickety stall where an old lady sits, selling melons. Larry sits inside and Phil walks to a phone by the side o the road. He dials.
17) 172) text: Suddenly the door of the hearse flies open and Larry runs out. Phil holds the phone away from his ear as Barbara's shouting can be heard coming out of the receiver. He watches as Larry just makes it to a cactus and is violent sick. He glances across to where the old melon woman watches, expressionless, from her stall. After a moment, Larry wipes himself down and walks back to the car.
17) 178) text: He puts the phone down, cutting off Barbara's squawk and watches Larry get into the hearse. He frowns.
17) 205) dialog: Sunstroke.
17) 210) dialog: I'm susceptible.
17) 221) dialog: This isn't the way to Palm Springs.
17) 265) text: Larry drives and talks, Phil looks tense.
17) 267) dialog: See, the Yin is the negative - the darkside. And the Yang represents positive - good. If you like, the first is earth and the second heaven.
17) 272) text: Larry still talks.       Phil now looks bored.
17) 274) dialog: The Yin Yang symbol is really evocative about the whole concept. As you travel around the circle, white or black will increase until the opposite color is almost gone. But never totally gone, right? And this cycle then repeats for the opposite color.
17) 283) text: Larry still talks, glancing across to Phil to make his point every now and then. Phil is tossing a cigarette int the air and trying to catch it between his teeth.
17) 285) dialog: What seems like Yin is often supported by Yang, and vice versa. Let me give you an example: To truly know good, you must first know evil, and without good as a comparison, nothing can be evil. So by allowing Yin to flourish, you welcome Yan. By letting go of Yin, you are waiting for its return. Another example is...
17) 286) text: There is a crash, and the car slams to a halt. Larry is thrown forward, but manages to grab the wheel. Phil is no so lucky, and catapults into the dashboard, before being thrown back into his seat, the crumpled cigarette still gripped between his teeth.
17) 296) dialog: I was distracted.
17) 303) text: There is a faint noise. Larry hears it first and then Phi and then, as they strain to identify it, they see a tiny dot on the road ahead of them, which grows and grows as they watch it, and they peer hard into the wind to identi it and... it's a motorcycle cop.
17) 309) dialog: What now?
17) 314) dialog: Okay.   What about?
17) 321) dialog: Well... it's more a philosophy than a religion.
17) 325) text: He shoots a vicious look at Larry.      The cop parks his and removes his helmet.
17) 333) text: The sign gives an ominous creak.         Larry takes a si step, out of danger.
17) 343) text: They all look appreciatively at the desert, and the cop glances down at the keys in Larry's hand.
17) 345) text: Larry looks flustered.
17) 347) dialog: Ooooh, I'm well. Really well, actually. Thank you.
17) 348) text: The cop doesn't respond, just keeps looking at Larry with pleasant half-smile on his face.
17) 354) text: Larry turns and appears to see the huge buckled pole for the first time.
17) 356) dialog: Oh.
17) 372) text: Larry wobbles with shock.
17) 374) dialog: A body?     Stole a body?
17) 378) dialog: That's an empty coffin, officer.
17) 385) text: Larry thinks hard.
17) 387) dialog: Hearse.   Flowers.
17) 399) dialog: He said a body. He said we stole a body.
17) 404) dialog: He didn't say 'coffin'. He said 'body'. Tell me we haven't stolen a real person.
17) 411) dialog: Oh, I'm just overflowing with trust for you, man. I feel this overwhelming feeling of... trust every time I look at you.
17) 414) dialog: I'm gonna check inside that box just as soon as we're out of here.
17) 420) dialog: What are we going to do?
17) 423) dialog: What?
17) 426) text: Larry mulls this over.
17) 428) dialog: What about if I could slip out of these cuffs?
17) 436) dialog: No, really. I really can slip these cuffs.
17) 440) text: Larry pops his middle finger out of its socket, squeezes his hand and slides it out of the handcuff. He hands the other cuff to Phil, who stares at him in astonishment.
17) 442) dialog: Do you think we should go?
17) 445) text: Larry starts the car. He throws it into reverse and the bumper slowly disengages from the metal signpost. Suddenl the car tears loose and flies backwards, smashing into th cop's motorcycle, leaving him holding the radio and its trailing wire. Larry slams on the brakes.
17) 447) dialog: Oh shit.
17) 456) text: Phil screams at Larry.
17) 463) dialog: The steering lock is on.
17) 467) dialog: I can't - he's got the keys.
17) 472) dialog: Yes.
17) 478) text: Phil and Larry stare at the policeman out of the window a the car sweeps past. The cop gets his gun out of his holster, and Phil reaches into the glove box and pulls ou the screwdriver. He leans across Larry, jams it into the wheel column, and snaps the steering lock in two. The hearse's direction immediately changes.
17) 481) dialog: Okay.
17) 541) text: Phil finishes his beer, rubs his eyes and slumps back in his seat. He looks terrible, but not as bad as Larry who is pasty and sweating.
17) 543) dialog: Well, that's it! They're going to lock me up and throw away the key.
17) 550) dialog: You saw what happened. I drove over that cop's bike. That's destruction of police property, or something.
17) 554) dialog: Not 'til I met you...
17) 560) dialog: It's a dinosaur.
17) 565) dialog: (reads) 'The Polyonax Place'. (aside: to Phil) A Polyonax is probably some kind of dinosaur.
17) 568) dialog: (reads) 'Dinoburgers, Reptile Steaks and Primeval Soup. Titanosaurion portions, prehistoric pricing. Liquor served'.
17) 572) dialog: Let's not. The cops'll be after us and we should just get on to Palm Springs and do the thing, and then I can get home and you can... do whatever it is you do. Let's do that.
17) 579) dialog: You surprise me.    I vote we keep going.
17) 584) text: The hearse pulls up around the back of the building, and parks in a place that is hidden from the road. Phil gets out and stretches. He is joined by Larry, and they both peer round the side of the building to check that they ha not been observed. Then they walk towards the entrance.
18) 1) text: We are with a short-order cook. He expertly flips a burge from a hotplate and adds it to a plate overflowing with bacon, sausage and fries. He slips this plate onto a tray on which there is a second plate containing two pieces of plain bread and some lettuce. He dings a bell and a waite enters and picks up the tray. We move with the tray as he carries it from the kitchen and into the dining area. He stops at the bar to load three foaming glasses of beer an a glass of water onto the tray, and delivers it to Phil a Larry, who are sitting in a window booth. Larry has his head resting on the table. He lifts it as soon as the foo arrives.
18) 5) dialog: I do not.
18) 8) text: They both look at Larry's bread and lettuce.
18) 15) dialog: Look, I'm a vegetarian. I have a problem with dead flesh. Okay?
19) 3) text: Phil pushes his full plate away and finishes off the thir beer. He gets up. Larry notices he hasn't eaten anything.
19) 5) dialog: I thought you were hungry.
21) 4) text: Phil joins Larry and puts a bag of beers on the table.
21) 6) dialog: Speak to her?
21) 10) dialog: Your girlfriend?      Your wife?
21) 14) dialog: So you didn't?
21) 22) dialog: Maybe she's out.      Shopping, or something.

21) 150) dialog: I thought it was bad enough when I ran over the cop's bike, but now I'm a fucking body snatcher.
21) 152) text: Larry goggles at him.     His voice takes on a level of hysteria.
21) 154) dialog: Go? You go. I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going inside and I'm going to give that man his son back. I'm going to do the right thing, I'm going to follow my conscience, I'm going to...

21) 210) text: Phil is getting very tired, his vision is blurring and he shakes his head to wake himself up. He glances across and sees that Larry is awake and staring at him.
21) 214) dialog: So why d'ya do it?

21) 223) dialog: What, cruise around the desert until he starts to smell? Were you - both bombed?

21) 235) dialog: Anything, within reason.
21) 238) text: Larry is confused.
