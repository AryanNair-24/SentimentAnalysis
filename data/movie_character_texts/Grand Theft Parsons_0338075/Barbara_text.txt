4) 308) text: Barbara gives a wry smile.
4) 310) dialog: Still the jester Kaufman, and still very unfunny.
4) 313) dialog: It's better than a will, actually. It's a signed promise from Gram to leave me all his assets and belongings. And anyway, it's really none of your business what this is. I've come for the guitar.
4) 318) dialog: Yes. Gram's guitar.   He always kept it here.
4) 326) text: Barbara leans forward until their noses are almost touching.
4) 328) dialog: I don't believe you, Kaufman.

4) 605) text: Barbara sits at a table in her shabby kitchen, reading th will. She lights a cigarette and sits back in her chair.
6) 13) text: A door swings open, and Barbara appears. She is looking quite stunning, with a tight black suit doing equal justi to her womanly curves and her duties as a mourner. She strides down the sidewalk, and as a group of schoolchildr appears around the corner Barbara scatters left and right
6) 19) text: Barbara stops and whips round, her hair cascading across her shoulders, her blue eyes flashing. The man simply stares at her, enchanted by her beauty.

6) 24) text: Barbara smiles.
6) 26) dialog: Why, thank you...
7) 36) text: There is a line leading to the information desk, but Barbara ignores it. She walks up to a female teller, who is serving another customer, and cuts in.
7) 37) dialog: I'd like to see the manager, please.
7) 40) text: Barbara's eyes immediately water, and her lower lip trembles.
7) 42) dialog: I'm sorry. It's just that the man I loved died yesterday. I was forgetting my manners...
7) 49) text: Barbara fixes the teller with a no-nonsense look.   The teller responds with a similar look.
7) 51) dialog: The manager?
9) 3) text: Barbara is totally calm.
9) 5) dialog: It's not a piece of paper. It's a promise from Gram to leave me all his money.
9) 14) text: Barbara, realizing that she's getting nowhere, starts to cry.
9) 16) dialog: You don't seem to understand. These are his wishes.
9) 17) text: Barbara is now sobbing, and the bank manager is becoming increasing uncomfortable. He gives her his handkerchief.
9) 21) dialog: Please tell me how I'm supposed to get my money.
9) 25) dialog: Are you saying that I'm lying?
14) 127) text: Barbara is sitting in a cubicle opposite a middle-aged woman in a suit. Her allure appears lost on the official, who gives the dress a disapproving look.
14) 129) dialog: Parsons.
14) 134) dialog: Was.   He was a musician.
14) 138) text: With a flourish, Barbara places a copy of the LA Times on the table. The headline is 'Country-Rock Pioneer Dead' in large black print. The official glances at it and gives a thin smile.
16) 28) text: Barbara picks up the newspaper and rips it into pieces, which she scatters onto the desk. She walks towards the door.
16) 31) text: Barbara keeps walking.
16) 34) text: Barbara is gone, the door slamming behind her.
17) 57) text: Barbara is standing in her sitting room, the phone to her ear.
17) 59) dialog: You might need to repeat that.
17) 65) dialog: Stolen? What the hell do you mean, stolen? Who steals a body?
17) 108) text: Susie is moving her suitcases into the sitting room when there is a banging on the front door. Susie opens the doo and Barbara is standing outside.
17) 110) dialog: Where's the son of a bitch?
17) 113) dialog: Well, he's stolen Gram.
17) 117) text: Barbara lights a cigarette.
17) 119) dialog: They had some kind of weird pact. I think Phil's taken Gram out to the desert.
17) 126) dialog: Some kind of voodoo thing with hot wax and dolls to stick pins in.
17) 129) text: Barbara glances down at the packed bags and smiles.
17) 131) dialog: Now that is a wise move, if you ask me.
17) 140) dialog: You'll learn about Phil Kaufman. If you stick around long enough.
17) 143) dialog: I know he's a brainless, interfering asshole, yes.
17) 146) text: The phone starts to ring. Susie instinctively moves towards it, then stops. Barbara watches carefully.
17) 148) dialog: That's him, isn't it?
17) 156) dialog: Fine.
17) 165) text: Barbara smiles unpleasantly.
17) 166) dialog: Hello Kaufman. I know what you're up to, you thieving bastard. I know where you're going, and I know about your sick, revolting plans, and I'm coming after you. And when I catch you...
17) 172) text: Suddenly the door of the hearse flies open and Larry runs out. Phil holds the phone away from his ear as Barbara's shouting can be heard coming out of the receiver. He watches as Larry just makes it to a cactus and is violent sick. He glances across to where the old melon woman watches, expressionless, from her stall. After a moment, Larry wipes himself down and walks back to the car.
17) 178) text: He puts the phone down, cutting off Barbara's squawk and watches Larry get into the hearse. He frowns.
17) 185) text: Barbara slams the phone down. Then she picks up the receiver again and smashes it onto the table.
17) 187) dialog: Sonofabitch!
17) 190) dialog: Okay, honey. Do you want to see who Phil Kaufman really is? Do you want to see what he's capable of?
17) 191) text: Barbara shows Susie the door.
17) 193) dialog: Or maybe you already know I'm right.
17) 198) dialog: Well why don't we find out?
17) 199) text: Barbara turns and walks out.    Susie looks at her packed bags then follows.
17) 487) text: Barbara drives and Susie sits in the passenger seat.   It doesn't look as if they've spoken for hours.
17) 491) dialog: He's got Gram and I need him.
17) 497) text: Barbara shoots her a withering look.
17) 499) dialog: I know he's dead, Honey. But he hasn't been officially identified, and there's no certificate of death.
17) 502) dialog: Let's just say I'm overly sentimental, okay?
17) 506) dialog: Isn't everything?
17) 510) dialog: I was a great support to Gram before Kaufman came along and spoiled the party.
17) 514) dialog: What do you know?
17) 518) dialog: In his whole life, Phil Kaufman didn't do anything because it was the right thing to do. You can bet the ranch that wherever he is, he's having some fun.
17) 525) dialog: Sure it is, honey. That's why your bags were packed.
17) 528) text: Barbara laughs.
17) 530) dialog: You might exclusively love Phil Kaufman - but unfortunately, so does he. You're just handy to have around.
17) 536) text: Barbara dismisses her anger with a tight little smile.
17) 538) dialog: The truth can hurt, can't it?
21) 173) text: Susie seethes and Barbara smokes.
21) 177) dialog: Nice? No, I suppose not.    Does it matter?
21) 181) dialog: I do okay. Listen, I was an orphan at fourteen and a waitress at fifteen. I do what I do because it puts food on my table, and because if I don't look after myself, no-one else will.
21) 185) dialog: I don't want anything from you. It would be a bonus to see Kaufman crash and burn, but I don't need to be there when it happens.
21) 187) text: Barbara lights another cigarette.
21) 189) dialog: Gram was the first good guy I ever hooked up with. He wasn't perfect, but it worked between us. We just seemed to fit together. But Gram was already wild, and I made him wilder. Kaufman watched over him like a hawk, and when he felt things were getting out of control, he turned Gram against me. I lost the only decent thing in my life.
21) 196) dialog: Gram was an adult.   He didn't need a nursemaid.
21) 200) dialog: Yeah. Without my help and while Kaufman was babysitting.
21) 204) dialog: That's fine. I just want what's mine and then I'm gone. Gone real fast.
23) 0) text: A car drives past the inn and then brakes sharply and ski across the road. It reverses and pulls in, parking next t the hearse. Barbara and Susie get out and look around. Then Susie walks over to the hearse's passenger window an raps on the glass, and Barbara marches to the back of the hearse and attempts to open it. She can't.
23) 2) dialog: Where's the catch on this piece of shit?
24) 1) text: Phil comes to. He looks out of the window at Susie, then at the 'Joshua Tree' sign, then at the door to room eight then round to the back of the shaking hearse as Barbara tries to get the door open. His jaw drops open and he rub his eyes again, before getting out of the car.
25) 13) text: Barbara shouts from the back of the car.
25) 15) dialog: I told you what he's doing! He's going to set fire to my Gram in some freaky ceremony with witches and black magic and... dolls.
25) 23) dialog: (shouts) I want my man back!
26) 7) text: Stanley folds his arms.         Susie and Barbara follow the room.
26) 14) dialog: Hello Stanley. Remember me?     The psychotic girlfriend?
26) 28) dialog: The hell you are, Kaufman.
26) 85) text: He starts to cry. Larry shoots an imploring look at Phil. Barbara glances around the room.
26) 87) dialog: Can we just cut through this?
26) 90) dialog: You two stole the body. Theft.
26) 93) dialog: Sweetie, I'm sorry, but you seem to be in the whole thing up to your neck. Accessory.
26) 96) dialog: And you are an old fool who should have called the police, but hasn't. Stupidity.
26) 99) dialog: Now, let's just call the cops and get it done. The sooner we get us a death certificate and bury him, the sooner his soul will be properly laid to rest.
26) 100) text: Phil walks over to Barbara, picks her up and carries her into the bathroom.
26) 102) dialog: Hey! What the hell are you doing?
26) 111) dialog: 
28) 21) dialog: 
28) 57) text: Everyone looks surprised. Phil gives Larry a look of appreciative approval. Barbara starts to kick furiously a the door from inside the bathroom. Stanley pauses for a moment, and then walks outside. Phil and Larry watch him go, and Susie walks over to kiss Phil.
28) 89) text: She gets in. There is a final, almighty 'crash' from inside room eight. The three of them look at each other, and then Bernice is gone into the darkness. A moment late Barbara runs outside. She leaps into her car and screeche after them. In the distance a blue flashing police light suddenly materializes.
28) 92) text: Barbara is on the road, driving fast. Suddenly a blue flashing police light fills her mirror.
28) 94) dialog: Thank God!
28) 101) text: Barbara gives it everything.
28) 103) dialog: Please help me, they've got my boyfriend's corpse and they're going to perform a ritual with his body.
28) 107) dialog: My driving license?
28) 111) dialog: I've just told you that they've stolen a body and you want to see my driving license?
28) 112) text: He just stares at her.      Barbara is losing it.
28) 114) dialog: You people are supposed to be on the lookout for a hearse. A hearse is a big long car. You can usually tell which ones are the hearses, because they have coffins in the back. The one we're looking for is painted yellow. Does this look like a yellow hearse to you, asshole?
28) 115) text: Long pause. Barbara realizes that she might have gone too far. He starts to write a ticket.
28) 117) dialog: Is that a ticket? Are you writing me a ticket?
28) 188) text: The traffic cop is finishing the ticket when there is a ball of flame in the distance. Barbara just scowls.
28) 191) dialog: That'll be Gram Parsons, on fire.
28) 219) text: The police car arrives at the scene.       Barbara and th get out. He peers into the flames.
28) 223) dialog: (sarcastically) I recognize that birthmark on his shoulder. Look, can I make an observation?
28) 227) dialog: We're in the desert. It is dark. If you want to catch someone in the dark, it's best not to turn on big flashing lights and make a loud noise with a siren.
28) 230) dialog: No. But I'm really, really keen to find out.
