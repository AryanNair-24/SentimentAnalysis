4) 247) dialog: I represent the combined forces of charm, enchantment and exuberance.

4) 334) dialog: Hey, well done. You found the only unbroken thing.
4) 338) dialog: It's all part of the grieving process.
4) 341) text: Phil stares at her.
4) 345) dialog: Nothing.
4) 350) dialog: Do me a favor and get the guitar, sweetheart.
4) 358) dialog: 
4) 366) text: Phil is holding the phone.         He frowns.

4) 376) text: Phil straightens up.         He speaks curtly.
4) 378) dialog: Yes, you can help me as a matter of fact. I am...
4) 381) text: Again, we hear Phil's voice trumpeting out of the phone. The undertaker changes his tone.
4) 408) dialog: These things aren't that big.
4) 412) dialog: Not really.
4) 419) text: No answer.      Phil continues to check out the inside of car.
4) 423) dialog: It's best you don't know.
4) 424) text: Without a word, Susie gets up and walks into the house. Phil lies still. After a moment, she reappears with her bag. She flounces theatrically past him and opens the car door. Phil gets out of the back.

4) 431) dialog: Right.
4) 434) dialog: Again.
4) 435) text: She gets into the car and slams the door. She starts the engine, and Phil stands back, but the car doesn't move. After a moment the window winds down.
4) 444) text: Phil arrives on his trike outside a small house.
4) 451) text: A man is sitting cross-legged on the floor. A joss stick burns beside him, and sitar music plays in the background This is LARRY OSTERBERG, and he is meditating. There is a loud hammering on the door. Larry shows no sign of having heard anything. More hammering at the door, but still no response. Then the letter box creaks open and an eye appears in the slot. After a moment, the eye disappears and Phil's face appears momentarily at the window. The window seems to be slightly higher than Phil, so his face appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room.
4) 453) dialog: (O.S) Hello? Anyone there?
4) 454) text: Then Phil is gone. Larry expels a big breath. The letterbox creaks opens again and the eye is back.
4) 456) dialog: (O.S) There you are. I'm looking for Larry Osterberg.
4) 460) text: Phil barrels in and closes the door behind him.   He turn to take a look around the room.
4) 461) dialog: You Larry Osterberg?
4) 464) text: This might be sarcastic, but any nuance is lost on Phil, who props the guitar up against the wall.
4) 466) dialog: Very nice.     What's that noise?
4) 473) dialog: (carefully) Okay.
4) 477) text: Phil stares meaningfully at the burning joss stick, but puts the cigar away.
4) 479) dialog: Right.
4) 482) dialog: Oh, I'm Phil Kaufman.
4) 486) dialog: I'd like to hire your car.
4) 490) dialog: Well, I need to pick someone up at the airport.
4) 493) dialog: Yes, of course. It's just that I'm told your car is more suitable.
4) 497) dialog: Well... it's a hearse.
4) 507) dialog: It's... a joke.
4) 512) dialog: A prank.   A surprise.
4) 515) dialog: No, it's more of a fifty dollar surprise.
4) 519) dialog: Booked how?
4) 522) text: Phil pulls some cash out of his pocket and sorts through it.
4) 524) dialog: Well, here's two hundred dollars to unbook it. Let 'em carry their own trombones.
4) 525) text: Phil passes the money over.   Larry starts to count it.
4) 527) dialog: You don't need to count it.   You could trust me.
4) 537) dialog: That last twenty is for gas. Anyway - I haven't even seen the car yet. I'm the one who's operating on trust.
4) 542) text: The garage doors swing open and a hearse drives out into the sun. It is bright yellow and covered in painted flowers. One of the side windows is broken and a headligh hangs out. Phil's jaw drops open. Larry gets out of the driving seat and pats the roof, proudly.
4) 546) dialog: Bernice?
4) 551) dialog: It's yellow.
4) 555) dialog: It's supposed to be black.
4) 562) dialog: That might be my point.
4) 566) dialog: I paid you two hundred dollars for a black hearse.
4) 569) text: They stare at each other for a moment.       Then Phil si deeply.
4) 571) dialog: Okay.   Where are the keys?
4) 575) dialog: I gotta go.
4) 576) text: Larry looks from Phil to Bernice and back again.
4) 579) text: Phil thinks this over.
4) 581) dialog: Okay.   Well, let's boogie.
4) 582) text: Larry runs across and closes the doors on a pile of amps and band equipment that now sits in the garage. Phil puts the guitar in the back seat and they get into the car.
4) 592) dialog: Well, I've paid top dollar, so it's nice to see I'm getting the best...
4) 596) dialog: You are famous throughout the greater Los Angeles area.
4) 599) dialog: But you are the only guy with a hearse. Don't go getting carried away...
5) 1) text: Phil glances out of the window.
5) 3) dialog: Pull over.
5) 4) text: Larry parks, and Phil looks at his watch.
5) 6) dialog: Shit.
5) 13) dialog: Nothing.
5) 17) dialog: We'll wait here.
5) 20) dialog: Soon.
5) 24) dialog: Why do you ask so many damn questions?
5) 31) dialog: Look, will you please shut up asking me stuff?
5) 34) text: He looks out of the window, and then back at Phil, who no has his eyes closed.
5) 37) text: Phil doesn't answer for a moment.      Just as Larry open mouth to ask again, Phil speaks.
5) 39) dialog: Morning.
5) 40) text: Larry looks at Phil with astonishment.
5) 47) dialog: We'll make the pick-up in the morning.
5) 48) text: Larry tries to start the car. Phil leans over and plucks the screwdriver from his hand. He reclines his seat and closes his eyes.
5) 51) text: Larry opens the door and gets out of the car. He slams th door shut behind him and stomps off into the gloom. Phil doesn't move.
6) 4) text: He stares at Phil, who hasn't moved an inch: eyes still closed, unlit cigar hanging out of the corner of his mout feet up on the dash.
6) 7) text: There is still no response from Phil. After a moment, Larry settles back in his seat and closes his eyes.
8) 1) text: The sound wakes Phil, who glances around and stretches, before getting out of the car.
8) 6) text: The clerk busies himself opening up. Phil wanders around and knocks into a coffin. The lid bangs closed and the sound echoes around the hangar.
8) 10) dialog: I'm here to pick up a... coffin.
8) 11) text: The clerk looks Phil over. He's dressed in denim, with scuffed Harley-Davidson cowboy boots, topped off with a c down denim jacket with 'Sin City' stitched into the back.
8) 14) dialog: Yes I am.
8) 17) text: Phil looks irritated.
8) 19) dialog: Okay.   A casket.
8) 26) dialog: It   was due out on the next flight to   New Orleans, but I'm driving it   now. The stiff doesn't like to   fly.
8) 31) dialog: Yeah, but it's my day off.
8) 35) dialog: Mine or the...?
8) 38) text: Phil moves to the desk.
8) 40) dialog: Parsons.
10) 25) dialog: They'll be along. With this being a rush job, they said you'd understand.
10) 29) text: The men stare at each other. Then Phil pulls another note out of his pocket and passes that over. Again, the clerk pockets it.
10) 38) text: Phil smiles broadly at him. The clerk turns and selects a casket from a gurney behind the counter.
10) 43) text: Phil is wheeling a casket on a gurney down the middle of the hangar. He can see Larry peering through the window a him. He can also see a uniformed policeman approaching Larry from the other side of the street. As he speeds up to try and reach Larry first, the clerk calls out from hi desk.
10) 46) text: Phil closes his eyes and slows to a halt.
11) 22) text: Phil and the clerk peer into the open casket.
11) 24) dialog: Yup.   That's a she.
11) 28) dialog: Yeah...
11) 36) dialog: Gone?    Whaddya mean, gone?
11) 40) dialog: Nice work.     So how do I get my box back?
11) 41) text: The clerk raises an eyebrow.         Phil understands imm
11) 42) dialog: You're a damn thief.
11) 45) text: Phil reluctantly hands another note over and the clerk speaks into a radio.
12) 19) text: Phil glances nervously out to where Larry is being interrogated by the cop. The clerk is reading a paper.
12) 21) dialog: Can you speed things up?
12) 23) text: Phil is distracted, watching the cop and Larry out of the window.
12) 25) dialog: I'd like to get to the Joshua Tree while it's still light.
12) 30) dialog: What?
12) 32) text: Phil is under pressure.
12) 34) dialog: Joshua Tree, yeah.
12) 37) dialog: Joshua Tree, Louisiana. Just outside the city.
12) 44) dialog: It's small. Just another local community struggling to get by.
12) 45) text: The buzzer goes again, and Phil attempts to change the subject.
12) 47) dialog: Use your phone?
12) 48) text: After a moment, the clerk nods towards the phone on the desk, before turning and disappearing into the rear of th mortuary. Phil wipes some sweat from his forehead, picks up the phone and dials.
12) 56) text: The clerk returns with a casket on a gurney and Phil replaces the receiver as the clerk flips open the top of the casket and peers inside.
12) 59) text: He wheels the casket over and Phil has a quick look insid
12) 62) text: Phil signs the papers.
12) 66) dialog: Yeah.   I'm a real lucky guy.
12) 67) text: Phil again glances out of the window.
12) 112) text: They stare at each other. The cop shifts position and purses his lips. Larry stares at the ground looking for some kind of inspiration. Just when the silence moves beyond uncomfortable, the door of the mortuary opens and Phil clatters out with the casket.
12) 114) dialog: Well, I don't care if it is first thing in the morning - but I sure need a coffee. I tell you, I've never seen so many darned bits of paper to sign! It's paperwork which is slowing this great country down. We're drowning in triplicate!
12) 116) dialog: Good morning officer.
12) 121) dialog: I was just saying how people with work to do - people like yourself, officer - are just getting engulfed by paper. Grab the end, will you? Doesn't that just drive you plain crazy?
12) 128) text: Phil gestures at Larry to get into the car, which he does
12) 130) dialog: One casket, six sheets to sign. Six! That can't be right. Does that sound right to you?
12) 135) dialog: And the very last thing I want to do is to hold you up further with my chatter. Thank you for your help, officer. You have a good day, now.
12) 139) text: Phil smiles up at him.
12) 141) dialog: Yessir?
12) 144) text: Phil doesn't miss a beat.
12) 146) dialog: And there you have it, officer. You see the gentleman we're meeting from the plane doesn't yet know about the sad passing of his... aunt.
12) 156) dialog: Yeah. We're doing it this way for the avoidance of doubt.
12) 169) dialog: Thanks for everything, officer. We'd best be off...
13) 1) text: Inside the car, Phil bangs on the dashboard in joy and exultation.
13) 3) dialog: Yes!    We did it!!
13) 6) text: Phil changes the subject.
13) 8) dialog: What was all that babbling about earlier?
13) 15) dialog: What the hell does that mean?
13) 19) dialog: Well of course they make you feel uneasy. They're supposed to make you feel uneasy.
13) 20) text: Larry sulks. Phil shakes his head and glances back at the cop and Larry crashes the car straight into the hangar wall.
14) 3) dialog: You hit the wall.
14) 7) dialog: (shouts) There's a gap fifty yards wide! You just had to aim for the gap. How could you miss the gap?
14) 10) text: The cop peers in at the window and gestures at Phil to wi it down. As he does, the glass falls out.
14) 12) dialog: Hello, officer. I guess they make these hearses wider than they need to...
14) 26) text: Pause.   Phil wills him to speak.
14) 28) dialog: Well...
14) 35) text: He walks back to his car.           Phil shakes his head.
14) 37) dialog: Fantastic.     Well done.
14) 41) dialog: You... you just drove into a wall! Of course it's your fault. Jesus!
14) 44) dialog: Here it comes...
14) 48) text: The police car drives up to, and then past, the hearse, before disappearing out of the hanger at speed. Phil and Larry look at each other.
14) 50) dialog: Well?
14) 54) dialog: Well, what are we doing now?
14) 57) text: Phil just stares at him. After a moment, Larry reverses Bernice and then drives the battered car through the gap and out of the hangar. Phil slumps back in his seat.
14) 59) dialog: Nice going, hippie. Went right through the gap that time.
14) 60) text: Larry says nothing.     Phil leans back in his seat.
14) 62) dialog: Well, we got it. Whoooh!!!
14) 63) text: Larry slams the brakes on and the huge car skids to a hal in a cloud of dust. Phil is flung forward in his seat.
14) 65) dialog: Jesus... What now?
14) 68) dialog: What are you talking about?
14) 71) dialog: C'mon, we gotta keep moving.
14) 75) dialog: Look, I can see you're a bit... sensitive about this whole... casket thing.
14) 82) dialog: (shouts) Stop saying that!    I can't get out.
14) 86) dialog: I... look, it's not right to throw me out onto the street with a coffin.
14) 89) dialog: Thank God.
14) 92) dialog: What the hell are you doing?
14) 96) dialog: You can't do that.
14) 97) text: Nearly at the turn now. Phil opens the car door with a mind to jump out, but one look at the fast-moving road changes his mind. He glowers at Larry and shuts the door. The hearse skids round the corner, Larry slams on the brakes and the car slides to a halt outside the mortuary.
14) 101) dialog: What talk?
15) 1) text: Larry is staring at Phil.      Waiting.
15) 3) dialog: Can we please talk about this later? This is not a great place to be right now.
15) 4) text: Larry moves to get out of the car.        Phil grabs his
15) 6) dialog: Oh, just a minute. Now I understand... You think there's a body back there.
15) 9) dialog: You think there's a body in the coffin!
15) 10) text: Larry watches him laugh.      Phil catches the look and s laughing.
15) 12) dialog: I can fully understand why you'd think that. I mean, it is a coffin and all. But would I - would I really - steal a real live dead body?
16) 1) text: Larry is staring at Phil.
16) 5) dialog: Absolutely, completely, totally.
16) 9) dialog: They are made of finest... poplar. That's very heavy wood.
16) 13) dialog: Look, I'm not going to argue with you now. Poplar is very well suited to the making of coffins.
16) 14) text: Larry stares hard at Phil. We see the door of the mortuar open over Larry's shoulder and Stanley and the clerk emerge. Then:
16) 20) text: Phil glances at the approaching Stanley.
16) 22) dialog: I'm... selling them on to a company in Palm Springs. Lots of stiffs, lots of money. And then of course, it's very environmentally sound. And... look, under the circumstances, perhaps we should renegotiate the financial arrangement between us.
16) 23) text: Larry still stares at Phil.      Stanley is almost at the
16) 25) dialog: Fifty-fifty? That baby's worth two grand.
16) 26) text: Stanley is getting ever closer. Phil can see him in his wing mirror. Larry releases the safety brake and the gian car roars away, leaving Stanley standing in a cloud of dust.
16) 37) text: Larry drives. Phil is still pitching.        They are dri alongside the airport runway.
16) 39) dialog: So then Bobby transfers 'em into hardboard boxes just prior to the cremation and I drive the caskets over to a guy I know in Palm Springs who resells them.
16) 46) dialog: Well I'm not sure the 'one careful owner' thing works with coffins.
16) 50) dialog: Yeah, well. I saw how outraged you were back there, when I mentioned money. Just think of it as recycling.
16) 54) dialog: Why?
16) 59) dialog: Well, while I acknowledge the power of your argument, we have to be somewhere else. So just settle back and enjoy the ride.
16) 62) dialog: What now?
16) 68) text: An attendant is filling Bernice.           He looks Phil
16) 72) dialog: Sure am.
16) 79) dialog: Nope. We're special rock 'n roll undertakers. Musical morticians.
17) 1) text: Larry is sitting on the toilet seat - still fully dressed but bent double with cramps. Then Phil bangs on the door and calls from outside.
17) 3) dialog: 
17) 8) text: The tank is full, and the attendant screws the cap back o Phil reaches into the back and pulls out his jerry can. H passes it to the guy.
17) 10) dialog: High test.
17) 13) text: Phil raises an eyebrow, glances across at the casket, and winks.
17) 14) dialog: Who says it's for the car?
17) 19) dialog: Nope.
17) 23) text: Larry is driving, Phil is looking out of the window.   Th are still in a built up area with cars around them.
17) 30) dialog: Why would we want to do that?
17) 34) dialog: You want to go home to pick up fresh clothes?
17) 36) text: Phil stares at him.
17) 38) dialog: And then drive back out tomorrow?
17) 42) dialog: Just drive the car, okay?
17) 46) dialog: No.

17) 79) dialog: No, not like a well-paid gopher. I'm responsible for movement, maintenance and management. I'm a confidante and a companion, a partner and a patron, an ally, agent and ambassador. I'm like an executive nanny. Not a gopher.

After a moment, Larry wipes himself down and walks back to the car.

17) 299) dialog: Of course you were.
17) 305) dialog: I don't believe it. Middle of nowhere, and... quick - stand in front of the car!
17) 311) dialog: Pretend we're having a conversation.
17) 316) dialog: I don't know what about! Ever since I met you, you've talked. Yabba, yabba, yabba, every waking minute. Religion, your supersonic, supercharged car, the darkside. Now you need to talk, and you can't think of anything to say.
17) 317) text: The cop slows down but drives past.        Phil waves at
17) 319) dialog: Whatever your damn fool religion is called, I think it works.
17) 324) dialog: Oh, well done. Good work.
17) 332) dialog: Afternoon, officer.    How's it going today?

17) 417) dialog: Jesus!

17) 429) text: Phil treats the theoretical question with indifference.
17) 434) dialog: Yeah, that would be great. Then we could suspend you from a bridge in a straitjacket and set the rope on fire.
17) 437) text: He has Phil's attention now.
17) 439) dialog: Okay.   Show me.
17) 440) text: Larry pops his middle finger out of its socket, squeezes his hand and slides it out of the handcuff. He hands the other cuff to Phil, who stares at him in astonishment.

17) 478) text: Phil and Larry stare at the policeman out of the window a the car sweeps past. The cop gets his gun out of his holster, and Phil reaches into the glove box and pulls ou the screwdriver. He leans across Larry, jams it into the wheel column, and snaps the steering lock in two. The hearse's direction immediately changes.
17) 480) dialog: Can we please go?
17) 541) text: Phil finishes his beer, rubs his eyes and slumps back in his seat. He looks terrible, but not as bad as Larry who is pasty and sweating.
17) 545) dialog: Why would they do that?
17) 552) dialog: You worry too much.
17) 555) text: Phil finishes his beer and peers at the empty bottle. The something catches his eye and he leans forward in his sea

We move with the tray as he carries it from the kitchen and into the dining area. He stops at the bar to load three foaming glasses of beer an a glass of water onto the tray, and delivers it to Phil a Larry, who are sitting in a window booth. Larry has his head resting on the table. He lifts it as soon as the foo arrives.
18) 3) dialog: You frighten him.
18) 7) dialog: Everyone else, he announces the food when he brings it. Diplodocus this and Allosaurus that. Us he just slaps it down and runs for cover.
18) 13) dialog: It's probably the rabbit food.

21) 95) dialog: Well, I think we should just make our delivery as soon as possible, don't you? Get our package to Palm Springs. Remember?
21) 100) dialog: Stolen... his son? That's outrageous! I'm appalled that you could even think we'd do such a thing.

21) 113) text: Phil glances at his watch.
21) 115) dialog: Okay, then. Well, if you're satisfied, let's go.

21) 233) dialog: Well, what would you do for them?
21) 236) text: Phil stares out of the window.
21) 237) dialog: That's what I hate about people like you. Everything's 'within reason'. There are always boundaries, provisos. You only operate with a safety net.
21) 241) text: Phil says nothing.
21) 244) dialog: You've missed the point. See, it doesn't matter what he would do, or what you and your tie-dyed friends think is the correct way to behave. To me, it only matters what I do. Where you have boundaries and limits and thresholds - I only have right and wrong. If I make a promise, I keep it - that's right. If I break that promise - that's wrong.

25) 1) text: Phil stands in front of Susie.
25) 6) dialog: A hippie hit it.   I thought you'd gone.
25) 10) dialog: What the hell does that mean?

26) 38) dialog: It's too late to claim him now.
26) 43) dialog: It means that you were never there when it mattered to Gram. It means that you stopped being a father the moment he stopped doing your bidding. It means that you learned to care too late. That's what it means.
26) 47) dialog: Not to me, no.
26) 57) dialog: No - he gave it his all, but in a way you could never understand. And all he ever wanted from you was approval. He wanted you to be proud of what he had achieved.
26) 61) dialog: It's no good telling me.   You should have told him.
26) 65) dialog: Too late...
26) 66) text: Stanley looks up at Phil.
26) 70) dialog: I was both, yes.
26) 74) dialog: Yes.    That's right.

28) 3) dialog: Did you call them?
28) 7) dialog: Are you going to call them?
28) 11) dialog: There isn't a reason. If someone tried to steal my son's body, I'd stop them. For sure.
28) 16) dialog: I'm expecting to.
28) 25) text: Phil and Stanley look up.
28) 39) dialog: Better make the point.
