Madness and pounding, the boys cackling like Hy as they beat the living hell out of that door. Little shrinking, backing away and covering his ears. The SOUND of things cracking under his feet as he moves: the ground is covered with glass and syringes, small plastic vials rolling around all over. The pounding stops. Little staring at the door as he HEAR the boys descending the steps with that same juiced energ Little’s eyes never leaving that door -- waiting, anticipating, expe-- BANG! A window, the rear bedroom. Doesn’t shatter, just a loud, percussive thump. Little creeps across the room -- same CRUNCH of glass beneath his feet, creeps into...

Calmly, methodically, Little moves across the sand, approaching the water. A beat more of Little easing up to surf, then... .--he looks back: his dark skin moistened in the ocean sp moon catching him same as its catching the surface of the Atlantic. And those eyes: looking right at us, staring plaintively, plainly, nothing requested, no expectation: just a clear, undisturbed openness. Hold this gaze, then... ...-Little turning from us, his form and movement slowly, steadily melding into the flow of light and waves as we h out into the ocean and we... FADE TO BLACK.
