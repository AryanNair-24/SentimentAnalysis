12) 15) dialog: For first-timers, I recommend either Willow Creek Bridge or Donner Trail.
12) 17) dialog: I'm not sure of the name's origin. They're the two paths we regularly patrol. Something happens and you're on one of the other trails, it might be awhile before we find you.
12) 20) dialog: Unless it says not to, you can set up where you like. Just make sure when you turn in that you extinguish your fire. Oh, and this here's bear country.

That dirty trap however's prime for spreading infection, need to finish cleaning out that wound and then I'll get some "evening primrose" in you. Same stuff the Indian Tribes used it back in the day to heal, well... just about everything. So's do I. Ida unwraps the tourniquet, examines the wound. IDA
