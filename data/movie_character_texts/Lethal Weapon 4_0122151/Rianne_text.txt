Knocks on the window to get the attention of the NURSERY NURSE. Holds up his badge. The Nurse nods, moves to an islolette containing a swaddled baby, its head obscured by the blanket. She wheels the isolette to the window. Unwraps the blanket, revealing... A BLACK BABY GIRL. Double-takes all around... when there's a tap on Riggs' shoulder, and he turns to see Butters and Murtaugh. Butters holding up his badge for the nurse. And now everybody's starting to understand the mix-up. The nurse goes to get another isolette as we WATCH BUT CAN'T HEAR Riggs, Butters, Murtaugh, and Leo. It's clear Rianne's just had her baby, too. Congratulations all around. Then the nurse wheels up the second isolette, pulls back the blanket... and reveals RIGGS BABY BOY. OFF the men, looking in, making faces at the kids --
