32) 7) dialog: Good Morning. I apologize for the bumps, but Florida just doesn't seem to like us Georgians. Must be the beatin' the Bulldogs put on the Gators last fall.
32) 10) dialog: Stretch out and relax. The air might stay a little cranky so I'm gonna ask that you sit tight if you can, with your seat belts fastened. 23.

34) 118) dialog: (into his mic) ...21 thousand. We are declaring an emergency! We are dumping fuel! We have a jammed stabilizer...or something. We need a block of altitude to work the problem...and a heading to the nearest airport! (YELLS to Evans) I'm starting to lose it!
34) 123) dialog: 
34) 130) dialog: DO IT! 30 percent!
34) 133) dialog: That bought us a little time. We need to revert to manual control. Your side first, pul...

34) 167) dialog: Get strapped into the jump-seat. I need your help.
34) 170) dialog: Margaret, see that red lever on the floor next to my chair? The one that says, Manual Control?
34) 174) dialog: On the count of three you pull it up, turn it clockwise, then push it back down. OK? You ready?
34) 177) dialog: Here we go. One, two...
34) 180) dialog: ...three!
34) 184) dialog: Ok. OK. We got something. It's still stiff as hell. Evans, put in some power!
34) 187) dialog: I don't know. It feels like the son of a bitch wants to nose over.
34) 191) dialog: 
34) 201) dialog: (keys his mic) Not good. You got anything closer? We're in a rapid dive here...
34) 205) dialog: Negative. We're too high...we can't pitch for glide. We have no stabilizer control.
34) 215) dialog: OK! Here's what we're going to do!
34) 221) dialog: When I ask for power, push both of these forward. Got it?
34) 226) dialog: Say "I love you Trevor."
34) 232) dialog: The black box.
34) 238) dialog: We're gonna roll it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control.

49) 9) dialog: Don't go. I'll be quiet.
49) 12) dialog: We don't have to talk. Be nice to just smoke with someone.
49) 18) dialog: Yeah, I was. Were you?

49) 105) dialog: Yeah? 58.
49) 109) dialog: Your mom had cancer.
49) 114) dialog: But why'd that guy ask you if you were gonna die?
49) 118) dialog: Is that right?
49) 124) dialog: Well, where should we live? If we're gonna save the world, where should we do that?
49) 127) dialog: What?
49) 134) dialog: You don't want me either.
49) 137) dialog: Where do you live?

69) 20) text: Yes they found them, perfectly intact.  WHIP
69) 22) text: Hugh's an attorney who specializes in criminal negligence-  WHIP

75) 1) text: WHIP parks his car at a fire hydrant right in front of NICOLE's building and gets out with his cane. He pops a f beer and looks at the building, looking for a proper entrance. He notices Fran walking quickly along the secon story balcony -- carrying a baseball bat.

75) 3) text: Now, WHIP HEARS an argument escalating between Fran and NICOLE.

82) 2) text: You can see the initial impact sheared the right wing clean off. If only the left wing had come off at impact, I think everyone would have walked off that plane.  WHIP
82) 4) text: It snapped but stayed connected to the airframe. So it whipped back towards the plane, hit the fuselage in front of the tail. If you were sitting in the last 6 or 7 rows on the left side, it was like being hit by a train.  WHIP

82) 27) text: Listen clearly. There was a mechanical issue with the plane, but what you and I know? Is that this was an act of God. I'm gonna fight to get the NTSB to place "act of God" on the probable causes list.  WHIP
