All of the Olympians are seated a present: Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Apollo, Artemis, Hestia, Hephaestus, Ares, Hermes, Demeter, Aphrodite, and Athena. In the first throne, is ZEUS. He resembles a strong, ROMA EMPEROR, a sculpted, grim face, his eyes rainy grey, with well trimmed beard. Next to him is POSEIDON. He resembles a handsome SURFER. His skin is deeply tanned, hands scarred like an old fisherman's. His hair is long, sun streaked. His striking blue eyes are identical to Percy's. A faded tattoo of a TRIDENT is on his muscular forearm. The Gods are in the middle of an intense, HEATED ARGUMENT Zeus and Poseidon are the most angry, looking as if they' about to get into a fist-fight. Athena tries to intervene

127) 20) dialog: (takes the horn) That will do. Hades loved that hideous beast. He can grow a new one with this. Yes... I think we'll be able to get your friend released. Annabeth steps forward, tentatively at first.
127) 25) dialog: Our meeting is adjourned. (glares at Poseidon) I still don't trust you. And with that, Zeus VANISHES in a blinding flash of lightning. Athena LOOKS at Annabeth.
