All of the Olympians are seated a present: Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Apollo, Artemis, Hestia, Hephaestus, Ares, Hermes, Demeter, Aphrodite, and Athena. In the first throne, is ZEUS. He resembles a strong, ROMA EMPEROR, a sculpted, grim face, his eyes rainy grey, with well trimmed beard. Next to him is POSEIDON. He resembles a handsome SURFER.
