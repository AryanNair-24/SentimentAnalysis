Reflected in the pool, the face of DR. ROYER-COLLARD, an  immaculately groomed gentleman, in his fifties with a squ jaw. He looks down at the waterlogged LUNATIC with chilli satisfaction.
8) 1) dialog: My colleagues have called me old- fashioned; even barbaric.
8) 3) dialog: But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor  an...aggressive...course of treatment.
8) 5) dialog: I don't seek popularity or renown,  Monsieur DelbenГЁ. Mine is a higher  mission. ROYER-COLLARD gives the signal again. GAILLON raises the  lever, and the GOON surges upright, his ribcage heaving. ROYER-COLLARD strides up to the PATIENT and regards him w sanctimony. The MADMAN quivers under his gaze.
8) 6) dialog: To take God's tiny blunders...those  He has forsaken...and condition them  with the same force...the same  rigor...you would employ to train a  feral dog or wild stallion. Another nod, another crank, and--with a scream of protest the LUNATIC is again lowered into the pool.
8) 9) dialog: It may not be pretty, but it is mercy  just the same. Splashing and gurgling; DelbenГ© shouts above the tumult:
8) 11) dialog: Charenton? The administrator there  is quite well-loved, is he not?
8) 13) dialog: Do you know how I define "idealism,"   Monsieur DelbenГЁ? DelbenГ© waits for an answer; the DOCTOR's eyes twinkle.
8) 14) dialog: Youth's final luxury. ROYER-COLLARD emits a knowing laugh. DelbenГ© joins him.
22) 0) text: The RUMBLE of HOOVES. The DOCTOR's COACH--with its Gothic accoutrement--lurches into the drive. GAILLON hops off, a opens the door. ROYER-COLLARD disembarks. Emanating from  within, the EXHILARATING MUSIC. The DOCTOR and GAILLON  exchange a look; have they come to the right place?
23) 0) text: As COULMIER conducts, he notices several SINGERS are  distracted; they're staring past him, all the way down th nave. He turns to see ROYER-COLLARD, flanked by GAILLON a VALCOUR, in the doorway. VALCOUR shoots COULMIER a look t says "He's here." COULMIER turns, and silences the choir  with a smile.
23) 5) dialog: This may feel a tad awkward, my  friend, but it needn't be. I've merely  come to oversee your work here;  understood?
23) 7) dialog: It's a formality; truly.
23) 9) dialog: I'll need an office on the grounds;  someplace to store my things.
23) 12) dialog: It seems a particular patient of  yours has captured his fancy.
24) 0) text: COULMIER and ROYER-COLLARD confer, en route to THE MARQUI CELL.
24) 1) dialog: I understand he practices the very  crimes he preaches in his fiction.
24) 3) dialog: Indiscretions, Abbe?  Please. I've  read his case history. At sixteen,  he violated a serving girl with a  crucifix. After six months in the  dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a  prostitute, cutting her flesh with a  razor, then cauterizing the wounds  with wax--
24) 8) dialog: Playing dress-up with cretins? That  sounds like a symptom of madness;  not its cure. Suddenly, THE MARQUIS rears up in the peephole to confron ROYER-COLLARD face-to-face.
25) 0) text: COULMIER and ROYER-COLLARD make their way through the asy High above--along the railing of the grand staircase-- MADELEINE appears, flanked by MICHETTE and CHARLOTTE. The come to size up the new DOCTOR.
25) 3) dialog: Why is he in your care, and not a  proper prison?
25) 5) dialog: His wife's?
25) 7) dialog: And he's never once attempted escape?
26) 2) dialog: What is the impact of all these  amenities upon his psyche?
26) 4) dialog: And his writing? COULMIER suppresses a tiny smile.
26) 8) dialog: Well....?
26) 10) dialog: Do you favor its publication?
27) 2) dialog: All France is aghast at this book,  yet you've not heard of it?
27) 4) dialog: Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a  conviction...an idealism...peculiar  to the very young. And so I'll be  candid.  The Ministry has sent me  here with the most explicit...the  most severe instructions.
28) 1) dialog: Unless we set Charenton on a straight  and narrow course, she'll be shut  down forever by order of the Emperor.
28) 4) dialog: In their eyes, the Marquis is the  surest barometer of your progress  here.
28) 7) dialog: Have you tried bleeding him with  leeches? The calming chair? Maybe  you should flog him at the stake?
28) 9) dialog: You're a sentimental man.
28) 11) dialog: You find this amusing, do you? COULMIER rallies passionately on his own behalf:
28) 15) dialog: And place my reputation at stake?
28) 17) dialog: I've stringent standards, true, but  I've something else the Ministry  failed to take into account; a heart. COULMIER almost collapses with relief and gratitude.
31) 1) dialog: My, my.  At Charenton, even the walls  have eyes.
31) 6) dialog: Well?
31) 8) dialog: And---?
31) 11) dialog: You keep strange company, Abbe. But  if you truly have matters in hand  here--
31) 13) dialog: --then I've friends of my own to  visit. ANGLE ON: THE MARQUIS, watching, ever-watching, from the  hole in his door.
32) 1) text: ROYER-COLLARD stands beneath the convent's trellis, and p on the door. It opens, revealing the MOTHER SUPERIOR--SIS NOIRCEUIL--a severe-looking nun in a wimple.
32) 5) dialog: I've come for my bride.
32) 6) text: SISTER NOIRCEUIL leads ROYER-COLLARD down the corridor; a heavy set of keys dangles from the belt around her waist.
32) 8) dialog: I've taken a new post at Charenton;  I need the succor only a wife can  provide. They arrive at the room of the convent's ward, SIMONE.
32) 15) dialog: My apologies, Mademoiselle; I'd no  time to write.
32) 16) text: SIMONE stands in her traveling cape, clutching her MADONN ROYER-COLLARD beside her. A CLUSTER of NUNS has gathered bid SIMONE adieu; among them, the twins SISTER FLAVIE and SISTER ROSE FATIMA. The MOTHER SUPERIOR hands SIMONE a sm valise:
34) 0) text: ROYER-COLLARD sits stiffly by his new bride; she stares o the window. Looming on the horizon, a towering chateau. SIMONE's eyes grow wide with wonder. TWO MEN stand outsid waiting to greet them, with their own carriage and driver standing by.
35) 0) text: DelbenГ© accompanies ROYER-COLLARD and SIMONE across the toward the chateau.
36) 1) dialog: (drily)
36) 5) text: The place hasn't been occupied since  the Terror; it belonged to the Duc  de Blangis, an avowed monarchist.  The Jacobins were most... unforgiving. Lying askance, a moldy old shoe with a cracked heel. DelbenГ© sidles up to ROYER-COLLARD and says confidential
36) 10) dialog: I don't shed tears over the past,  Monsieur DelbenГЁ; I look to the  future. Royer-collard stands and turns to Prouix:
36) 11) dialog: We'd best quarry fresh marble, don't  you think? PROUIX dutifully makes a note.
37) 0) text: ROYER-COLLARD coaxes PROUIX aside for a confidential  conversation:
37) 1) dialog: You're to humor my wife in all things. If she wants Venetian glass, she's  to have it. Italian tile, Dutch  velvet; spare no expense. (lowering his voice  to a whisper)
37) 4) dialog: In the convent, Simone was spared  the world's temptations. I won't  have her falling prey to them now. ROYER-COLLARD glances over the railing, down below; SIMON stands, overwhelmed, in the enormous atrium. Over her hea the beating of wings.
37) 5) dialog: She's a rare bird; I intend to keep  her caged.
41) 12) text: Mmm. Yes. I'm sure. COULMIER notices ROYER-COLLARD mounting the steps with SI In her finery, SIMONE looks less like a society bride, an more like a child playing dress-up. COULMIER gives the DO a cordial wave. ROYER-COLLARD nods, curtly.
41) 22) text: The catacombs have been converted into a make-shift theat in-the-round. The place has a slightly sinister feel; one Dante's lower circles. A primitive platform stage has bee erected in the spot customarily held by MADAME LECLERC's  vat. The SOCIETY FOLK sit on benches alongside the FEEBLE and DAMNED. THE LUNATIC QUARTET plays its bizarre instruments 18th century curled horns, and home-made strings. A grinn DAUPHIN lights the torches that will illuminate the stage From the AUDIENCE, excited twitters. A grand night for slumming among the loons! A bacchanal! He sees RENEE PELAGIE take her seat, and lower her hood,  craning her neck for a sight of the man she loves. Next, marks ROYER-COLLARD, sitting on a newly-erected dais next his lovely wife SIMONE. COULMIER sits at the DOCTOR's  shoulder, pointing out various notables in the crowd:
41) 24) dialog: (evincing interest)
41) 53) dialog: Leave at once--
41) 57) dialog: Do as I say. A forlorn SIMONE exits; GAILLON escorts her toward the do
42) 27) text: Don't be absurd; it's only a play. COULMIER glances past THE MARQUIS to see ROYER-COLLARD ri from his seat, and--imperiously--gather his hat and coat. Their eyes meet for an instant; ROYER-COLLARD shoots dagg
42) 33) dialog: (brusquely)
42) 36) dialog: No. It most certainly was not. He boards, slamming the door shut with finality:
42) 37) dialog: You ought to be ashamed, Abbe.   Exploiting those drooling, pathetic  cretins for financial gain--
42) 39) dialog: --a veritable freak show for tourists  and curiosity seekers. Charenton is  a sanatorium; she is not a circus.   The theater is henceforth closed. As  for your avowed friend--playwright  emeritus of the madhouse-- COULMIER swallows; he knows what's coming.
42) 41) dialog: (cutting him off  abruptly)
47) 0) text: CRAFTSMEN buzz about the place like flies, carrying gilde mirrors, uncrating sculpture, fitting wall sconces, etc. GAILLON stands by at the door. ROYER-COLLARD AND MONSIEUR PROUIX are at one end of the room, in rapt consultation. Swatches, marble samples, and blueprints litter their tab
47) 2) dialog: (beaming)
47) 9) dialog: It is customary to write first, and  request an appointment--
47) 11) dialog: My schedule is not subject to the  whims of lunatics. RENEE PELAGIE removes her hat, indicating her intention t stay.
47) 13) dialog: (with a sigh)
47) 16) dialog: With all due respect, Madame, all  France is familiar with your husband. (to MONSIEUR PROUIX)
47) 19) dialog: Madame, please. RENEE sits.
47) 20) dialog: I assume you've come to plead for  clemency on your husband's behalf.
47) 24) dialog: I stand corrected, Madame. Now that she's alone in the DOCTOR's company, the full fo of RENEE PELAGIE's despair issues forth:
47) 26) dialog: It's not so easily done, Madame. He rises, circling RENEE PELAGIE.
47) 27) dialog: You're aware, are you not, that it  costs a great deal to house your  husband at Charenton...
47) 29) dialog: That barely covers the cost of his  room. There's nary a penny left over  for appropriate treatments. Opiates  to quell his temper. Restraints to  chasten him when he misbehaves. RENEE PELAGIE can sense the direction of the conversation she blushes, and stares at her hands in her lap.
47) 30) dialog: Perhaps if you were to buttress your  entreaties with the means to oblige  them...
47) 34) dialog: But you've a pension, haven't you,  from the sale of his books?
47) 36) dialog: What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
47) 40) dialog: That ill-gotten funds, borne of his  degeneracy, might now effect his  salvation. RENEE ponders the thought; it has a certain righteous  symmetry.
47) 41) dialog: If you're truly determined to step  out of the shadow of your husband's  celebrity--
47) 43) dialog: --words alone are insufficient.
47) 45) dialog: Imagine; old friends once again  deigning to kiss your hand. (kissing her hand,  seductively)
47) 50) dialog: Now is the time to secure your  epitaph: The benevolent Marquise,  Charenton's most revered  philanthropist...or Satan's Bride. A torturous moment of indecision for RENEE PELAGIE.
48) 1) dialog: Rest assured that your generosity  speeds your husband ever faster toward  a cure. MONSIEUR PROUIX bolts up from the front steps of the CHAT ROYER-COLLARD whispers through his teeth:
48) 2) dialog: The Peruvian marble; without question. MONSIEUR PROUIX stares after the DOCTOR, baffled. The DOC escorts RENEE PELAGIE into her carriage. She gazes soulfu into his eyes:
48) 4) dialog: And I in yours.
48) 6) dialog: Of course.
54) 0) text: An enormous table separates ROYER-COLLARD from SIMONE. Even the dining room is in the midst of renovation; half walls are covered in silk damask; the other half are bare SIMONE reads from a thin book. ROYER-COLLARD has had more than his share from the carafe of wine; he's feeling  "expansive" tonight.
54) 1) dialog: We've ceiling beams en route from  Provence, and--next week--a muralist  arrives from Paris, to paint a trompe- l'oeil in the ballroom. SIMONE doesn't look up from her reading.
54) 2) dialog: Doesn't that please you?
54) 5) dialog: I'd prefer to have our brandy in the  salon. There we can sit...side-by- side...before the fire.
54) 7) dialog: You prefer a book to your husband's  company? SIMONE glances down at her hands, trembling in her lap. S can't bring herself to answer.
54) 10) dialog: Well, no wonder; I'm only flesh and  blood. That's no match--is it?--for  the printed page. He stands, sullen, and tosses his napkin onto his plate.
54) 11) dialog: Good evening, then. I hope you enjoy  your solitude.
55) 1) text: Dressed only in a night-shift, SIMONE holds a book in one hand and a candle in the other. She hears footsteps; the  door opens. SIMONE blows out her candle. Through the curt she sees the looming shadow of her husband, carrying a ta of his own. ROYER-COLLARD parts the drapes.
55) 2) dialog: I apologize if I took a severe tone. He plucks the book from her hands, and regards its title a moment: A Lady's Garden of Verse. He smiles, bemused.
55) 3) dialog: You can't be blamed for your naivetГЁ,  not when it's chief among your charms. He climbs into bed next to her; she rolls on her side, fa away from him. He presses himself hard against her back a whispers hoarsely in her ear:
55) 4) dialog: Perhaps the Sisters failed to instruct  you in the ways of marriage; the  nightly duty of a wife to her husband. He takes the hem of her night-shift in hand, and with a  wrenching rrrriiiippp starts to tear it up the rear. SIMONE--terrified at what's to come--seeks solace from th room's only comfort: the porcelain MADONNA from the Panth Convent sitting on her nightstand. The VIRGIN exudes a ho light that illuminates SIMONE, even as she's violated by husband.
62) 0) text: Steam rises thick as soup from the laundry vats. With a  flourish, ROYER-COLLARD unrolls a ruddy bedsheet for  MADELEINE's inspection. COULMIER stands by. MADAME LECLER creaks back and forth in her chair, anxiously.
62) 1) dialog: Your mother may be blind as a bat,  but you've a keen pair of eyes,  haven't you? MADELEINE flares defensively on her mother's behalf.
62) 3) dialog: This could cost her far more---
62) 6) dialog: What could cause a tincture like  this?
62) 12) dialog: Perhaps your kettles are stained  with rust. Maybe the lye's turned  rancid. Or maybe...just maybe... He plucks a candle from the wall sconce, and holds it beh the sheet; bleeding through the fabric, traces of cursive
62) 13) dialog: ...these sheets once belonged to our  friend, The Marquis.
62) 15) dialog: Such a fine thread-count? Decorated  in his very own script? ROYER-COLLARD turns to COULMIER and says decisively:
62) 16) dialog: She's lying. It shows in her face. COULMIER looks at MADELEINE, imploringly. Now is the time tell the truth. But MADELEINE--though her cheeks are blus with guilt--doesn't budge.
69) 16) dialog: (to VALCOUR)
69) 20) dialog: I won't sully my hands with him.
71) 4) text: She singles out faces: ROYER-COLLARD, who watches imperio from a window above, GAILLON at his side. CHARLOTTE, who  watches the proceedings with smug satisfaction. MADAME  LECLERC, whose foggy eyes are filled with tears. MICHETTE LOUISON, GUERIN and ORVOLLE, all faces ripe with sympathy And--separated by a fence--the LUNATICS--FRANVAL, PITOU,  CLEANTE, and DAUPHIN among them. BOUCHON, a hideous scar on his cheek from the iron, all b drools in anticipation. VALCOUR looks to ROYER-COLLARD for permission to strike;  coolly ROYER-COLLARD grants it. MADELEINE flinches in  anticipation of the blow. It comes down, hard.
71) 8) dialog: He'll do no such thing.
71) 10) dialog: This child let loose the beast from  its cage--
71) 15) dialog: 
71) 20) dialog: You'd suffer in her stead?
71) 23) dialog: That won't be necessary. A sigh of relief from the CROWD. As VALCOUR frees him,  COULMIER rubs his wrists. ROYER-COLLARD stares at him wit steel eyes.
71) 24) dialog: If you want to martyr yourself, Abbe,  do it for God. Not a chambermaid.  Now put your clothes back on.
73) 0) text: ROYER-COLLARD sits at a table, ledger before him, MONSIEU PROUIX on one side, GAILLON on the other. Lining up for  payment, various CRAFTSMEN: a BRICKLAYER, perhaps, A  CARPENTER, A GARDENER. The DOCTOR hands a small sheath of bills to a particularly large STONE-MASON. When the STONE MASON steps out of the frame, the DOCTOR is confronted by surprising sight: an incensed RENEE PELAGIE.
73) 1) dialog: Good God, Marquise--
73) 3) dialog: This is neither the time nor the  place--
73) 5) dialog: (sotto voice)
73) 10) dialog: Gentleman, if you'll excuse us...only  a moment...thank you, thank you... Amidst grumbles, GAILLON clears the room, closing the doo behind him. MONSIEUR PROUIX hovers behind it, listening.
73) 11) dialog: You've no right to assault me in  this fashion; I'll call for my  footman.  I'll have you removed--
73) 23) dialog: It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
77) 0) text: ROYER-COLLARD snoozes in his nightcap. SIMONE has her hea deep in a book: A Lady's Garden of Verse.
77) 2) dialog: It's late, Simone, darling. Put your  poems aside. SIMONE just licks her forefinger, and turns the page.
82) 0) text: ROYER-COLLARD walks up the impressive steps to the front  door, GAILLON at his heels. Stuck there--with a quill pen letter.  He plucks it, glances back at GAILLON, then star to read. His iron jaw begins to quake.
84) 0) text: Lying haphazardly in the center of the mattress: A Ladies Garden of Verse. ROYER-COLLARD makes a grab for it, only turn it over and discover its true contents. A primal cry rises in ROYER-COLLARD's throat. Savagely he rips into th pages with his bare hands, shredding them. THE MARQUIS' w flutter down like snow. They fill the screen
85) 14) text: We see the recipient of THE MARQUIS' spleen: peering thro the peephole, ROYER-COLLARD. In his eyes, some small meas of vengeance, sated. He slips out of sight. 
144) 0) text: ROYER-COLLARD empties the last dregs from his wine bottle pitiful little puddle in the bottom of his glass. Before  him, the asylum record books in grave disarray. GAILLON  lounges in a near-by chair. As the DIN of the RIOT grows  around them, they exchange a look; one that says "We knew this would happen. How could it not?" EXT. CHARENTON - TERRACE. COULMIER, soaked in the rain, searches the courtyard. All around him, WARDS--like pagans--are stripping off their  clothes, dancing in the storm. PITOU rides atop GUERIN's  shoulders; LOUISON tries to beat him off with an andiron. The scream again; COULMIER whirls around, expecting to se MADELEINE. Again, his hopes are dashed. It's MICHETTE, pi to the wall, set upon by a group of LASCIVIOUS WARDS, the limbs all intertwined in an orgiastic frenzy. ONE BESTIAL MAN turns to look at COULMIER, his eyes wild, scrap of MICHETTE's clothing dripping from his mouth, lik flap of flesh. COULMIER dives in to rescue her, but--instead--he's set u by more MISCREANTS, who tug at his robes and paw at his h like creatures turning on their Master.
145) 0) text: From above, the insistent, demonic chanting of Madeleine' name.  GAILLON bursts from the office and makes for the  stairs; ROYER-COLLARD strides out after him, glancing  imperiously this way and that.
147) 3) text: As he passes, ROYER-COLLARD hears a scuffle from within. He pauses, and reaches for the knob. Just then, he hears  COULMIER and THE MARQUIS in the distance, each crying out for Madeleine. From the pantry, her Voice:
148) 0) text: Cinders fall from above. Poised along the stair, ORVOLLE, VALCOUR and GAILLON. They're passing pails of water upwar in an effort to quell the flames.  ROYER-COLLARD joins th line, passing a sloshing bucket from ORVOLLE to VALCOUR
148) 1) dialog: Quickly now! Altogether men, as one! ORVOLLE looks at him, surprised to see the aloof DOCTOR  suddenly so pro-active.
148) 4) dialog: QUICKLY! Before it reaches the rafters  on the upper floors-- GAILLON gazes at his BOSS with glowing admiration. Coming down the stairs--disoriented in the smoke and the melee-- MADAME LECLERC. With one hand, she clings to the railing. With the other, she grasps at the air.
154) 0) text: ROYER-COLLARD closes the door to the dungeon, and cracks knuckles with barely-controlled fury.  COULMIER sits, his head bowed.
154) 1) dialog: Of course, we mustn't blame Bouchon;  he's merely one of Nature's  experiments, gone awry. No discipline.  No conscience. No morality. He rears up from behind his desk:
154) 2) dialog: In fact, it is our duty to provide  those things on his behalf. Is it  not? COULMIER raises his head. His eyes are red from crying, b he's resolved not to lose his temper before the DOCTOR.
154) 4) dialog: He was so impressed with the Marquis'  tale that he chose to re-enact it,  yes?  Upon a certain chambermaid. COULMIER nods. ROYER_COLLARD blithely sticks the knife in and gives it a turn.
154) 5) dialog: Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind  me of her name...
154) 7) dialog: 
154) 12) dialog: So tell me: when you're called before  God, how will you answer for  Madeleine's death?

168) 3) dialog: I'm afraid that our endowment has  shriveled to a mere pittance; we're  the laughing stock of all France.  But--on a happier note-- The DOCTOR smiles, and pats the ABBE jovially on the arm.
168) 4) dialog: --the hospital is now in my sole  command. ABBE DU MAUPAS all but runs to keep pace with the DOCTOR.
168) 5) dialog: Here each man must work for his keep. ROYER-COLLARD swings open the gate to the work-room for t ABBE DU MAUPAS.

169) 10) dialog: Ever since his unfortunate death,  there's been a surge of interest in  his work. I'll use the profits to  restore Charenton to her former glory.

171) 14) dialog: Gibberish, my friend. He rants and  he raves-- COULMIER offers the DU MAUPAS a challenge, urging him to  defy ROYER-COLLARD:
171) 16) dialog: You'll do no such thing. This patient  poses a grave danger, to himself and  to others. With lightning speed, COULMIER reaches through the peepho grabbing ROYER-COLLARD by the collar. He yanks him, hard, against the door, strangling him with his own cravatte. T DOCTOR's face starts turning purple. ABBE DU MAUPAS pauses for a moment; who should he honor? His employer, or the mad prophet in the cell? Impulsively acts, loosening COULMIER's grip on the DOCTOR. ROYER-COLL gasps for air.
171) 19) dialog: (interrupting)
171) 21) dialog: Some men are past redemption. ROYER-COLLARD straightens his collar and smooths back his hair, and starts striding back down the hall. ABBE DU MAU
