13) 7) dialog: Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it  through my tiny hole... The HAND lets her go. MADELEINE rises, cautiously looking about. She reaches into her apron pocket and pulls out a  key. She inserts it in the lock; it turns.
14) 0) text: MADELEINE enters. Upon first glance, it's less like a hos room than the apartment of a faded aristocrat. On the wal sketches of courtesans in erotic poses, culled from Justi and Juliette. On the bookshelf, medical volumes: The Hist of Madness, Lateau's Illustrated Anatomy, and Diseases of the Bowel. In the corner, a foot-stool carved from human  bone. And--atop an ornate wooden desk, mottled with ink-s an explosion of quills. But no sign of the MARQUIS.
15) 3) dialog: Did I frighten you?
15) 7) dialog: It's the only frontier I have left,  plumcake.

15) 14) dialog: You've already stolen my heart, as  well as another more prominent organ,  south of the Equator...
15) 16) dialog: I've just the story...inspired by  these very surroundings... The MARQUIS dislodges a stone from the wall, and pulls ou scroll of pages, then blows on them. Dust fills the air.
15) 21) dialog: Most assuredly.
15) 23) dialog: Fiendishly so. MADELEINE squeals with delight.
15) 24) dialog: But it comes with a price. MADELEINE's face pales a bit. What might that be?
15) 25) dialog: A kiss for each page.
15) 27) dialog: (cooing low in her  ear)
15) 30) text: Oh, you. You talk same as you write. She blows a wayward curl from her face, and leans in to k THE MARQUIS. A quick peck.  He passes her a single page. She takes it, shuts her eyes, and puckers her lips again. This time, THE MARQUIS traces her lower lip with his  forefinger.  MADELEINE trembles, partly in fear, partly w pleasure. Then he plants a kiss on her lips.  He inserts tongue--forcefully--and her eyes pop open in surprise.
17) 3) dialog: The climax comes at a higher cost;  you must sit on my lap.
17) 5) dialog: The story's thrilling conclusion  comes at a premium.
17) 9) dialog: (low and hypnotic:)
17) 10) text: Your maidenhead.  And then you must  sew it up as tightly as the day you  were born, and come back to me renewed  so I can deflower it a second time. MADELEINE wriggles out of his grasp, and SLAPS him, hard. The MARQUIS is stunned, but impressed by her gumption.
18) 4) dialog: Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
18) 8) dialog: Conversation, like certain portions  of the anatomy, always runs more  smoothly when it's lubricated. Glug, glug, glug as the MARQUIS pours two glasses of wine
18) 9) dialog: It's a rare vintage from an obscure  village in Bordeaux. Rather than  crush the grape underfoot, they place  the fruit on the belly of a bride  and reap its juices when the young  husband steers his vessel into port. He sniffs his glass rapturously, then passes one to COULM

18) 12) dialog: I should've told you it was the blood  of Christ; you'd believe that,  wouldn't you?
18) 14) dialog: (grumbling)
18) 19) dialog: I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
18) 21) dialog: Don't be so sure. COULMIER's amused in spite of himself. THE MARQUIS laughs too, only with a slightly sinister edge.
18) 23) dialog: (with a smile)
23) 14) dialog: Why, why, WHY should this be happening  to me?!
23) 17) dialog: Once again, gentleman! FRANVAL kneels before PITOU, holding a lady's satin shoe. PITOU--meanwhile--is preoccupied with his wig; a flowing  cascade of golden curls. Behind them, a tawdry back-drop

30) 3) dialog: Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the  type's too small---
30) 5) dialog: But you implored me to write!  For  curative purposes, to stave off my  madness--
30) 7) dialog: Have you truly read the book in  question? Or did you run--straightaway--  to the dog-eared pages?
30) 9) dialog: And--?
30) 13) dialog: There I was taxed; it's true.
30) 15) dialog: I write of the great, eternal truths  that bind together all mankind! The  whole world over, we eat, we shit,  we fuck, we kill and we die.
30) 17) dialog: It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
30) 19) dialog: I thought that was your duty, Abbe,  not mine.
30) 21) dialog: It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it?  He's come to usurp your place here,  hasn't he?

30) 34) text: If ever I showed you a kind hand,  Marquis....If ever I granted you  walking privileges on a Spring day,  or slipped an extra pillow beneath  your door...if ever I shared your  wine, laughed at your vulgarities,  or humored you with argument...then  you will oblige me now.  For your  sake, and for all Charenton. THE MARQUIS--seemingly touched--says quietly:
30) 35) dialog: You've a touch of the poet, too;  perhaps you should take up the quill.
30) 39) text: Do I have your word? THE MARQUIS catches MADELEINE's reflection in his mirror. In her face, the question: "What on earth are you going t do?" He winks at her.
30) 40) dialog: Have no fear, Abbe. He turns back to COULMIER. He has the open, honest eyes o Spaniel, but his words are double-edged:
30) 41) dialog: I swear; all that Charenton has given  me, I'll repay a hundred-fold. MADELEINE's eyes grow wide with wonder at the prospect.
30) 43) dialog: (indignant now)
30) 44) text: Honestly! You cut me to the core!   What's the point of all your valiant  attempts at rehabilitation if--when  I finally succumb--when at long last,  I pledge myself to righteous conduct-- you regard me with nothing but  suspicion?  Have you no faith in  your own medicine? COULMIER smiles; THE MARQUIS has a point.
40) 2) dialog: Why, the hypocrite.  It has all the  makings of a farce, hasn't it? Run  straightaway, and tell Franval to  cancel rehearsal... CLOSE UP: A MAGNIFICENT WHITE QUILL PEN. As he blithely hums "Claire de la Lune," THE MARQUIS dips the quill into his ink well; the liquid shoots up the  feather's shaft, turning it a deep purple color. On his PARCHMENT, in calligraphic script, the words "The  Crimes of Love: A Play in Several Lascivious Acts..." THE MARQUIS' little tune rises all the way to symphonic t and we fade up to...

THE MARQUIS survey the LUNATIC CAST spread out before him, readying their ni of glory.
41) 21) dialog: Remember, gentlemen!  Inside each of  your delicate minds...your distinctive  bodies...ART is waiting to be born.  So let's give the Doctor a performance  I hope he'll remember forever... The CAST gives a rallying cry; THE MARQUIS turns and peer out the tattered velvet curtains.
41) 25) text: Oh indeed? Meanwhile--backstage--FRANVAL nervously taps the MARQUIS the shoulder:
41) 27) dialog: The dedication, word for word; it's  every bit as crucial as the play  which follows--
41) 36) dialog: The Crimes of Love!
41) 58) text: As SIMONE and GAILLON slip toward the exit, THE MARQUIS s waiting for them. He casts a knowing glance at SIMONE, th wisecracks to GAILLON:

42) 26) dialog: (with mock innocence)
42) 27) text: Don't be absurd; it's only a play. COULMIER glances past THE MARQUIS to see ROYER-COLLARD ri from his seat, and--imperiously--gather his hat and coat. Their eyes meet for an instant; ROYER-COLLARD shoots dagg

43) 5) dialog: (dropping his fork)
43) 8) dialog: But I kept my promise! I didn't  publish-- COULMIER shoots a glare that says "Oh, please."

45) 5) dialog: They're filled with cream, yes? You  know I shan't touch them, unless  they're positively bursting--erupting--  with cream. RENEE PELAGIE blushes happily, delighted that she's pleas him. THE MARQUIS crosses to her; en route, he notices VALCOUR, spying through the peephole. He snaps it shut.
45) 8) dialog: What else have you brought that I  might nibble upon? He presses her against the wall, cupping her breast, and  kissing the tip of her nose. She offers faint protest:
45) 10) dialog: Hm? Tell me.  What other treats?
45) 13) dialog: For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm  to sit here, gorging myself on useless  trifles, sucking down your little  sweetmeats, when what I truly need--  what I truly require--are a few quill  pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
45) 15) dialog: Don't you see? I've been raped! Far  more egregiously than any of my  wretched characters--- RENEE PELAGIE breaks away from him, and says in a voice  cracked with emotion:

156) 39) dialog: Give her a proper burial. In the  churchyard, at my expense. Do not  inter her sweet body in the same  ground as the devils who inhabit  this accursed place. Pause, and then:

He buckles leather restra around the MARQUIS' torso.  The MARQUIS cranes his head, glances at the table beside him.  On it, primitive medica instruments, laid out ominously in a row.
