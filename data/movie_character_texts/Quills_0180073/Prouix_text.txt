37) 3) dialog: Bars, sir?
47) 0) text: CRAFTSMEN buzz about the place like flies, carrying gilde mirrors, uncrating sculpture, fitting wall sconces, etc. GAILLON stands by at the door. ROYER-COLLARD AND MONSIEUR PROUIX are at one end of the room, in rapt consultation. Swatches, marble samples, and blueprints litter their tab
47) 1) dialog: For a woman of humble origin, your  wife certainly has refined tastes!   When I suggest granite for the foyer,  she's quick to counter with Peruvian  marble. Peruvian marble! It costs a  fortune to import! SIMONE wafts past on the balcony above; she glances down them, smiles.  ROYER-COLLARD assumes the smile is meant f him; he offers a tiny wave.
47) 3) text: Whatever her heart desires, Monsieur  Prouix. MONSIEUR PROUIX assumes the smile is his; he offer his ow toothsome grin.
47) 4) dialog: I'd like nothing better, sir, than  to grant her every wish. (sotto voce, to the  DOCTOR)
47) 17) text: Grant us a moment alone, won't you,  Monsieur Prouix?
47) 18) dialog: Happily, sir. Your servant, sir. He gestures for the CRAFTSMEN to follow him out. The room a veritable hive of activity--is now silent. DR. ROYER-CO offers RENEE PELAGIE a seat.
73) 0) text: ROYER-COLLARD sits at a table, ledger before him, MONSIEU PROUIX on one side, GAILLON on the other. Lining up for  payment, various CRAFTSMEN: a BRICKLAYER, perhaps, A  CARPENTER, A GARDENER. The DOCTOR hands a small sheath of bills to a particularly large STONE-MASON. When the STONE MASON steps out of the frame, the DOCTOR is confronted by surprising sight: an incensed RENEE PELAGIE.

78) 1) dialog: Or--if you prefer--a Florentine  tapestry? SIMONE glances at ROYER-COLLARD, who's preoccupied with t FOREMAN in the atrium. She turns to PROUIX and smiles:
78) 5) dialog: Excuse me? From the folds of her skirt, SIMONE pulls her book.
78) 7) dialog: Madame, how could you...have you  actually read this volume?
78) 9) dialog: There comes a time in a young lady's  life when she has to cast book's  aside, and learn from experience. SIMONE cocks her head at a coy angle:
80) 1) dialog: "Most Esteemed Dr. Royer-Collard. At  long last, your Chateau is complete."
80) 5) dialog: "You'll find everything in its  assigned place."
