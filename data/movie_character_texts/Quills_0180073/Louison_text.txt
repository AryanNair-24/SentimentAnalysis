As she "practices reading" from a few stray s of parchment, the OTHERS listen enrapt:

11) 17) dialog: He writes books so wicked--so black  with evil--that one man killed his  wife, after reading 'em...
11) 19) dialog: I'd say that's murder enough.
37) 10) text: Louison and Guerin have come to exchange alms for candles from the nuns who make them, SISTER ROSE FATIMA and SISTE FLAVIE. The BOYS load boxes onto the asylum cart. They go

MADAME  LECLERC, whose foggy eyes are filled with tears. MICHETTE LOUISON, GUERIN and ORVOLLE, all faces ripe with sympathy And--separated by a fence--the LUNATICS--FRANVAL, PITOU,  CLEANTE, and DAUPHIN among them. BOUCHON, a hideous scar on his cheek from the iron, all b drools in anticipation. VALCOUR looks to ROYER-COLLARD for permission to strike;  coolly ROYER-COLLARD grants it. MADELEINE flinches in  anticipation of the blow. It comes down, hard.

GAILLON  lounges in a near-by chair. As the DIN of the RIOT grows  around them, they exchange a look; one that says "We knew this would happen. How could it not?" EXT. CHARENTON - TERRACE. COULMIER, soaked in the rain, searches the courtyard. All around him, WARDS--like pagans--are stripping off their  clothes, dancing in the storm. PITOU rides atop GUERIN's  shoulders; LOUISON tries to beat him off with an andiron. The scream again; COULMIER whirls around, expecting to se MADELEINE. Again, his hopes are dashed. It's MICHETTE, pi to the wall, set upon by a group of LASCIVIOUS WARDS, the limbs all intertwined in an orgiastic frenzy. ONE BESTIAL MAN turns to look at COULMIER, his eyes wild, scrap of MICHETTE's clothing dripping from his mouth, lik flap of flesh. COULMIER dives in to rescue her, but--instead--he's set u by more MISCREANTS, who tug at his robes and paw at his h like creatures turning on their Master.
