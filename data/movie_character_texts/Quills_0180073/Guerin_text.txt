As she "practices reading" from a few stray s of parchment, the OTHERS listen enrapt:
11) 18) dialog: And two young mothers miscarried  their babies!
11) 24) text: I think she's sweet on him, that's  what I think. GUERIN--meanwhile--has groped beneath MICHETTE's blouse a now fondles her breast. She purrs and glances at MADELEIN with a little half-smile:

38) 0) text: GUERIN whispers the tale to a gloriously naked MICHETTE, he makes love to her in the straw. His words are interspe with gasps and moans.
38) 2) dialog: --I say--the comely little thing--is  barely sixteen-- MICHETTE giggles, and turns to her left. There--surprise- lies LOUISON, pleasuring her from the other side.
71) 4) text: She singles out faces: ROYER-COLLARD, who watches imperio from a window above, GAILLON at his side. CHARLOTTE, who  watches the proceedings with smug satisfaction. MADAME  LECLERC, whose foggy eyes are filled with tears. MICHETTE LOUISON, GUERIN and ORVOLLE, all faces ripe with sympathy And--separated by a fence--the LUNATICS--FRANVAL, PITOU,  CLEANTE, and DAUPHIN among them. BOUCHON, a hideous scar on his cheek from the iron, all b drools in anticipation. VALCOUR looks to ROYER-COLLARD for permission to strike;  coolly ROYER-COLLARD grants it.

GAILLON  lounges in a near-by chair. As the DIN of the RIOT grows  around them, they exchange a look; one that says "We knew this would happen. How could it not?" EXT. CHARENTON - TERRACE. COULMIER, soaked in the rain, searches the courtyard. All around him, WARDS--like pagans--are stripping off their  clothes, dancing in the storm. PITOU rides atop GUERIN's  shoulders; LOUISON tries to beat him off with an andiron. The scream again; COULMIER whirls around, expecting to se MADELEINE. Again, his hopes are dashed. It's MICHETTE, pi to the wall, set upon by a group of LASCIVIOUS WARDS, the limbs all intertwined in an orgiastic frenzy. ONE BESTIAL MAN turns to look at COULMIER, his eyes wild, scrap of MICHETTE's clothing dripping from his mouth, lik flap of flesh. COULMIER dives in to rescue her, but--instead--he's set u by more MISCREANTS, who tug at his robes and paw at his h like creatures turning on their Master.
