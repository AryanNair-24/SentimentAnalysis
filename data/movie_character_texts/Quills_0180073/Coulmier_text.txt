MADELEINE can't help glancing at COULMIER from the corner her eye: such a virile man dressed in the chaste robes of monk. An intriguing contradiction.
10) 1) dialog: Of course, we mustn't just copy the  words; it's important that we know  what they mean. St. Augustine tells

18) 1) dialog: Madeleine--
18) 3) dialog: The next time you feel the urge to  visit the Marquis, I hope you'll  come to confession instead. MADELEINE nods, contrite, and slips out. COULMIER turns t find THE MARQUIS standing right behind him.
18) 7) dialog: It's not even noon--
18) 11) dialog: It's from our own cellar. I recognize  the taste. THE MARQUIS' face falls.
18) 13) dialog: We treat you well enough here, don't  we Marquis?  Your very own featherbed,  in lieu of a straw mat.  Your antique  writing desk, all the way from  LaCoste.  Enough quills to feather  an ostrich---
18) 18) dialog: In exchange, we ask only that you  follow the rules. Now you know as  well as I do...you're not to entertain  visitors in your quarters.
18) 20) dialog: I'm not a beautiful young prospect,  ripe for corruption.
18) 22) dialog: Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge  these wicked thoughts of yours on  paper; maybe they'll govern you less  in life.
18) 24) text: I'll fill page after page, I promise. COULMIER raises his glass in a friendly toast:
18) 25) dialog: Cheers.
20) 0) text: COULMIER reads from a large parchment scroll with a Royal wax Seal, newly-broken. VALCOUR stands by, anxious.

20) 7) dialog: Bravo, Dauphin. It's far better to  paint fires than to set them, isn't  it? DAUPHIN grins, happy for COULMIER's approval. A joyous bu of the Papae Marcelli mass.

23) 6) dialog: Of course.
23) 8) dialog: You're a man of Science; I'm a man  of God. Charenton stands to profit  from us both, I'm certain.

24) 7) dialog: He's made a great success of our  Little Theater; there's seldom an  empty seat.  Not to mention its  therapeutic value.
24) 10) dialog: This is Dr. Royer-Collard; he's  joining us here in an... He looks to the DOCTOR for help:

25) 8) dialog: A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't  last a day on the streets without  capture.
26) 1) dialog: Besides, every wholesome thing he  might desire, he has at Charenton. A  library, filled with the world's  great books, music lessons, watercolor  exercises--
26) 3) dialog: He no longer roars or spits. He no  longer taunts the guards or molests  his fellow wards--
26) 5) dialog: Oh. That.
26) 9) dialog: I's essential to his recovery; a  purgative for the toxins in his mind.
26) 11) dialog: For sale? To the general public?   Certainly not; it's unprintable. DR. ROYER-COLLARD reaches inside his jacket, and pulls ou copy of Justine. He hands it to the ABBE, who's dumbfound COULMIER starts to scan the pages; the unmistakable prose you-know-who.
26) 12) dialog: Dear God... He looks up to see that the DOCTOR has moved on, strollin down the hall with authority. He races to catch up.

COULMIER stares at these  instruments of torture with a mixture of wonder and  foreboding.
28) 2) dialog: (disbelieving)
28) 5) dialog: (his voice rising in  protest)
28) 8) dialog: Why?  So he'll learn to fear  punishment, rather than pursue virtue  for its own reward?
28) 10) dialog: A practical man, sir. Given the  Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound  thrashing on bare flesh may not  qualify as a deterrent.
28) 14) dialog: On the contrary. Let me take up this  matter with the Marquis myself--
28) 16) dialog: Charenton is my life's work. To have  her wrested from beneath me now-- ROYER-COLLARD pauses. His face softens, and he sighs:
28) 18) dialog: Thank-you, Doctor. I'll effect his  contrition; you have my word.
29) 0) text: COULMIER barrels down the hall, fuming. His head is deep the pages of the book; he almost bumps headlong into MADE on her morning rounds. She drops her laundry basket and  flattens herself against the wall:
29) 2) dialog: The Marquis. He's embarrassed us... (with incredulity)
29) 3) text: ...before Napoleon himself. COULMIER stops. He turns to MADELEINE, disheartened, and  confides the full force of THE MARQUIS' betrayal:
29) 4) dialog: He's been slipping manuscripts to  his publisher. MADELEINE feigns surprise and says in a guilty voice:
29) 8) dialog: I place my trust too carelessly,  Madeleine. Unbeknownst to COULMIER, this stings her. He turns the ke in the lock and enters, closing the door behind him. MADELEINE opens the peephole to spy on the scene which  follows:
30) 0) text: COULMIER storms in to find THE MARQUIS in a cloud of whit powder; he's dusting some fresh pages to set the ink. COULMIER slams the book down.
30) 1) dialog: This is a complete...an utter... (his voice falls)
30) 4) dialog: What did you do? Bribe one of the  guards?
30) 6) dialog: But you've no right to publish! Behind  my back, without my sanction!
30) 8) dialog: Enough to discern its tenor.
30) 12) dialog: It's not even a proper novel! It's  nothing but an encyclopedia of  perversions! Frankly, it even fails  as an exercise in craft. The  characters are wooden; the dialogue  is inane. Not to mention the endless  repetition of words like "nipple"  and "pikestaff"--
30) 14) dialog: And such puny scope! Nothing but the  very worst in man's nature!
30) 16) dialog: But we also fall in love; we build  cities, we compose symphonies, and  we endure. Why not put that in your  books as well?
30) 18) dialog: But isn't that the duty of art? To  elevate us above the beast?
30) 20) dialog: One more trick like this, and I'll  be forced to revoke all your  liberties!
30) 24) dialog: (blurting the truth)
30) 27) dialog: Our future lies in the stroke of  your pen.
30) 30) dialog: Put yourself in my place. I've your  fellow patients to consider. If  Charenton falls, they've no place to  go. No manner in which to clothe or  feed themselves--
30) 32) dialog: You among them? This gives THE MARQUIS pause; COULMIER has a point.
30) 33) dialog: (his most passionate  plea yet)
30) 38) dialog: (undaunted)
30) 42) dialog: If you only mean to dupe me again--
30) 44) text: Honestly! You cut me to the core!   What's the point of all your valiant  attempts at rehabilitation if--when  I finally succumb--when at long last,  I pledge myself to righteous conduct-- you regard me with nothing but  suspicion?  Have you no faith in  your own medicine? COULMIER smiles; THE MARQUIS has a point.
30) 45) dialog: (reassured)
31) 7) dialog: I spoke to him with reason and  compassion; the tools which serve us  best here.
31) 9) dialog: He's sworn to obedience. The DOCTOR--ever doubtful--mutters "tsk, tsk, tsk," and t to leave; COULMIER calls after him, insistent:

41) 12) text: Mmm. Yes. I'm sure. COULMIER notices ROYER-COLLARD mounting the steps with SI In her finery, SIMONE looks less like a society bride, an more like a child playing dress-up. COULMIER gives the DO a cordial wave. ROYER-COLLARD nods, curtly.
41) 14) dialog: (evasively)
41) 22) text: The catacombs have been converted into a make-shift theat in-the-round. The place has a slightly sinister feel; one Dante's lower circles. A primitive platform stage has bee erected in the spot customarily held by MADAME LECLERC's  vat. The SOCIETY FOLK sit on benches alongside the FEEBLE and DAMNED. THE LUNATIC QUARTET plays its bizarre instruments 18th century curled horns, and home-made strings. A grinn DAUPHIN lights the torches that will illuminate the stage From the AUDIENCE, excited twitters. A grand night for slumming among the loons! A bacchanal! He sees RENEE PELAGIE take her seat, and lower her hood,  craning her neck for a sight of the man she loves. Next, marks ROYER-COLLARD, sitting on a newly-erected dais next his lovely wife SIMONE.

41) 31) text: Madames and Messieurs, there's been  a change in tonight's program. ANGLE ON: COULMIER, who stiffens with apprehension. This is an unexpected development.
42) 13) text: COULMIER hears BOUCHON's tortured cry, and lurches from t dais, marching directly across the stage. VALCOUR leaps u from his own aisle seat, and follows the PRIEST. The  rollicking play continues onstage:

42) 22) dialog: Has he hurt you?
42) 24) text: His stinking breath caused my eyes  to run, that's all. COULMIER kisses her on the forehead. She clutches him in hug, and dissolves into tears.  COULMIER looks up to see MARQUIS standing nearby.  The TWO MEN lock eyes for an  instant; a flicker of jealousy passes between them.
42) 25) dialog: You mean to take us all down with  you?
42) 27) text: Don't be absurd; it's only a play. COULMIER glances past THE MARQUIS to see ROYER-COLLARD ri from his seat, and--imperiously--gather his hat and coat. Their eyes meet for an instant; ROYER-COLLARD shoots dagg
42) 32) dialog: It was fiction, of course.
42) 35) dialog: It was not inspired by circumstance.

43) 3) dialog: How can one man possibly be so  selfish?
43) 7) dialog: If you won't be true to your word,  then you've left me no choice. COULMIER grabs quills off the window-sill, the side-board and the secretary. THE MARQUIS realizes COULMIER means  business; he lunges for the ink stand. It spills, sending ink all over his desk.
43) 11) dialog: Perhaps--in time--you'll earn them  back through good behavior--
43) 13) dialog: Try reading, for a change. The writer  who produces more than he reads? The  sure mark of an amateur. He snares a Bible off the shelf, tossing it to THE MARQUI
43) 14) dialog: Start with the Bible; it's cheerier,  and more artfully written.
43) 17) dialog: You know what sacrilege is, don't  you?  The last refuge of the failed  provocateur. COULMIER yanks open the desk drawer. In it, bottles of in He starts to fill his pockets.
43) 20) dialog: Whores and pederasts? You're better  off without them. The MARQUIS abruptly switches gears; he has a new idea.
