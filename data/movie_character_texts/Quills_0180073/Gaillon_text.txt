MADAME  LECLERC, whose foggy eyes are filled with tears. MICHETTE LOUISON, GUERIN and ORVOLLE, all faces ripe with sympathy And--separated by a fence--the LUNATICS--FRANVAL, PITOU,  CLEANTE, and DAUPHIN among them.

COULMIER, soaked in the rain, searches the courtyard. All around him, WARDS--like pagans--are stripping off their  clothes, dancing in the storm. PITOU rides atop GUERIN's  shoulders; LOUISON tries to beat him off with an andiron. The scream again; COULMIER whirls around, expecting to se MADELEINE. Again, his hopes are dashed.
