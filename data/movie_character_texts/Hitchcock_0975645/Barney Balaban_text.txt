18) 7) dialog: The truth is, Hitch, every time you want to do something "different" like The Wrong Man or Vertigo, someone loses money.
18) 12) dialog: You owe Paramount one last picture, Hitch. Can't you do something like North by Northwest but for us this time instead of for MGM?
18) 21) dialog: No one respects the name Hitchcock more than Paramount. But even a talented man sometimes backs the wrong horse.
18) 33) dialog: I think you know me better than that, Hitch. I would never say "no" to you.
22) 5) dialog: Interesting. But tell us, what exactly is Paramount distributing? Is this still a picture about a queer killing people in his mother's dress?
22) 9) dialog: No-one's arguing that.
22) 14) dialog: Well, obviously you have a lot of passion for this project. Let me talk it over with a few people internally and I'll get back to you.
22) 26) dialog: Fine. We'll take that deal. If you can get the money...
73) 3) dialog: Hello, Hitch. How's the picture? I'm hearing interesting things...
73) 8) dialog: I shouldn't be in a position of just hearing things, Hitch. It's time you showed me some footage.
73) 19) dialog: To see if you're making a picture Paramount can actually release.
73) 23) dialog: Your contract also says Paramount isn't required to distribute any film that could cause us embarrassment.
104) 6) dialog: Alma.
104) 9) dialog: You know David Kirkpatrick. He's working on Jerry Lewis' next picture.
104) 12) dialog: So he's free to help... (a sly smile) if you need it...
104) 17) dialog: But you're nearly three days behind.
104) 27) dialog: Alma. We both know what kind of film this is. (then, closer) The smart thing to do would be to help Hitch finish it.
134) 10) dialog: "Absolutely never, ever will I allow anything to follow Psycho -- no previews of coming attractions, no newsreel, no short subject and certainly no double- feature. Sincerely, and, emphatically, Alfred Hitchcock."
