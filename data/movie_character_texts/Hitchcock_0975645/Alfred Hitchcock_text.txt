1) 21) dialog: 
1) 30) dialog: Good evening.
2) 2) dialog: Mere Technicolor baubles.
3) 15) dialog: No, when I was planning North by Northwest I could already hear the screams and laughter. (then, to a BEAUTIFUL
4) 24) dialog: Talking of arrows, did you read Mr. Weiler's review in the New York Times? Apparently, he found "the climax" to be -- and I quote -- "overdrawn."
4) 29) dialog: And how about this little grenade?
4) 48) dialog: Tell me, dear. Am I really too old?
4) 53) dialog: You always know precisely where to plunge the dagger, don't you?
4) 58) dialog: Where are you off to?
4) 62) dialog: We've just established that I'm too corpulent to be seen in broad daylight.
4) 66) dialog: Sleeping pills with dust jackets.
4) 72) dialog: Very presentable.
7) 6) dialog: The audience would spend the entire picture waiting for Miss Frank to discover the corpse I'd hidden in the attic. Wouldn't you agree, Silvio?
7) 13) dialog: (again, turning to Silvio) Doesn't she know I just made that movie? It's called North by Northwest. And "style" is merely self-plagiarism.
10) 3) dialog: Anything. Anything at all?
10) 9) dialog: Gin. Mother's ruin.
10) 21) dialog: And who is everyone?
10) 25) dialog: Is this the one based on Ed Gein, the serial killer?
10) 33) dialog: Peggy. This is the boy who dug up his own mother.
11) 7) dialog: Famished.
11) 25) dialog: The book or Mr. Whitfield Cook?
11) 31) dialog: Leave it on the night stand.
13) 6) dialog: Read the bit in the motel bathroom.
13) 17) dialog: But what if someone really good made a horror movie?
14) 8) dialog: Just think of the shock value. Killing off your leading lady halfway through.
15) 3) dialog: Peggy, I want you to summon your minions...
15) 8) dialog: Get them started buying copies of "Psycho."
15) 13) dialog: All of them. I want every copy, nationwide.
15) 27) dialog: That's exactly the point, my dear.
16) 26) dialog: I only wish he looked more like William Holden and less like Elmer Fudd.
16) 31) dialog: I was hoping everyone would. I mean life is deeply offensive and disgusting, isn't it?
16) 84) dialog: I wonder how that could have happened.
17) 10) dialog: But they can't stop looking, can they?
18) 4) dialog: Audiences want to be shocked, Barney. They want something different. And this is it.
18) 17) dialog: 
18) 30) dialog: Are you telling me "no?"
19) 5) dialog: My father ran a grocery store.
19) 10) dialog: They think I've lost my touch, Lew. My association with television has cheapened me.
19) 14) dialog: They just want the same thing over and over. They've put me in a coffin and now they're nailing down the lid.
19) 29) dialog: Eight hundred thousand... Give or take.
20) 8) dialog: What about him?
20) 13) dialog: Enjoy the pool now. We might not have it for that much longer.
20) 25) dialog: Paramount refuses to finance the movie. Imagine -- The studio that brought you Martin and Lewis and The Greatest Show On Earth considers Psycho distasteful.
20) 33) dialog: We're going to have to go it alone, old girl.
20) 46) dialog: Remember the fun we had when we started out and there was so little money and time? We took risks, we experimented. We invented new ways of making pictures because we had to.
22) 29) dialog: We've already got it, Barney.
23) 3) dialog: If this picture fails, Alma, we'll be in for a long, humiliating bout of crow- eating.
23) 7) dialog: Are you sure?
24) 21) dialog: No.
26) 4) dialog: I got Joe Stefano to write out the first few scenes. Why don't you take a look?
26) 10) dialog: Well?
28) 4) dialog: The only thing worse than a visit to the dentist is one to the censor.
29) 6) dialog: I assure you, Geoffrey, my murders, are always models of taste and discretion.
29) 10) dialog: She won't be nude. She'll be wearing a shower cap.
29) 25) dialog: It's completely necessary. Marion flushes evidence later found by her sister. It's a clue to the girl's disappearance.
29) 30) dialog: Perhaps we ought to shoot the film in France and use a bidet instead?
30) 9) dialog: Everyone in Hollywood resents me. I make them millions... and yet every year I sit at those dreadful award show dinners, waiting for them to say, just once, "You're good."
30) 16) dialog: Deeply.
30) 24) dialog: It's just that, more and more lately, I've been having these... impulses.
30) 30) dialog: Strong ones.
33) 3) dialog: Send them all back to Glendale.
33) 14) dialog: Well, tell "Swifty" he shouldn't have overexposed his client on television.
34) 5) dialog: Well, Norman is the logical extension of the boys in those movies. Appealing, sensitive, suffering the terrible burden of being forced to pretend to be something he is not.
34) 10) dialog: How so?
34) 24) dialog: Try to remember this is all just make believe.
34) 29) dialog: Further than you can possibly imagine.
35) 4) dialog: I'm getting blisters just looking at you.
35) 16) dialog: If I could get Grace Kelly to play the girl, they'd let me get away with anything.
35) 21) dialog: And all the more desirable.
35) 26) dialog: Too... Scottish.
37) 10) dialog: Of course the real secret of Mrs. Simpson's appeal to the Duke of Windsor was that she could make a toothpick feel like a cigar.
37) 16) dialog: Now, you must try the banana shortcake.
37) 24) dialog: Bring her the banana shortcake, George. In fact make it two large portions.
37) 41) dialog: It doesn't sound silly at all. Tell me one of her deepest secrets.
37) 54) dialog: Allow me to put your mind at rest.
40) 10) dialog: The gardeners only once a week and weekends off for the driver? No. Absolutely not. We'll find other places to cut.
40) 17) dialog: But those geese are from Barstow not Marseilles.
42) 10) dialog: Ed! Ed!
43) 3) dialog: Ed... Ed...?
45) 6) dialog: I've still got her under contract. I may as well get something out of it.
45) 10) dialog: For an utterly thankless girl.
45) 22) dialog: The more we frustrate them the more their interest will wane.
49) 3) dialog: Are you decent my dear?
49) 15) dialog: Perfect.
49) 20) dialog: It's just "Hitch", Tony. Hold the cock.
49) 34) dialog: (already moving past her) That's hand-woven imported camel hair from Rodier. Don't you approve?
49) 46) dialog: Everyone's is. Until Alma finishes the revisions. Now hurry along, Vera. You're just in time for the oath.
49) 52) dialog: I solemnly promise...
49) 56) dialog: (ignoring Vera's sarcasm) That I will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of Psycho...
49) 63) dialog: To friends, relatives, trade reporters or columnists -- not even to outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower, God bless him.
52) 8) dialog: I don't know...Perhaps as a boy, Norman secretly watched his mother preparing for her nightly bath.
52) 12) dialog: Yes -- one he could access with a chair so long as he was stealthy.
52) 25) dialog: You're the actor. You figure it out.
52) 31) dialog: All the better to see you at the greatest possible angle my dear...
52) 36) dialog: It's just my Jesuit work ethic.
53) 3) dialog: ... and if I'm not working then I'm nothing. I'm not even a person. I'm just a collection of molecules. A useless cylinder of ugly flesh.
53) 15) dialog: My mother? Yes.
53) 22) dialog: To her, movie people were akin to thieves and prostitutes.
53) 34) dialog: You're a fine one to talk.
54) 8) dialog: You will be wearing a white bra like this for the opening scene on the bed. And then after you've stolen the money...
55) 3) dialog: We go under the blinds and match dissolve into the room itself...
61) 5) dialog: I'll be right there.
63) 3) dialog: Was there a line at the market?
63) 9) dialog: Would you like a cocktail?
63) 17) dialog: 
64) 3) dialog: Maybe I was too dismissive about your friend Whitfield's book. Perhaps he and Elizabeth could come over this weekend and he can walk me through it.
65) 2) dialog: ... You think they can't tell... but they can. They know. It's all closing in on you. The noose is tightening...
70) 3) dialog: What's the hold up?
70) 10) dialog: 
70) 25) dialog: It's different when their pay is coming out of your own pocket.
72) 21) dialog: Stop trailing me like a puppy dog and get me something long, cool and wet.
72) 25) dialog: Give me the key!
73) 5) dialog: It's a wonder you can hear anything over the noise coming from the Shurlock office.
73) 10) dialog: Why?
73) 21) dialog: As you well know, Barney, my contract guarantees me final cut.
73) 25) dialog: Unlike the last five Martin and Lewis pictures you're all so proud of.
74) 6) dialog: Connect me to Maxim's of Paris.
76) 5) dialog: I've been asking myself the same thing.
77) 2) dialog: Did you know Adolf Hitler sketched the design for this car on Ferdinand Porsche's cocktail napkin in a Berlin beer garden?
77) 7) dialog: It's only now that I truly appreciate just how diabolical Herr Hitler was.
77) 15) dialog: So this is what they eat at the drive- ins...
77) 20) dialog: Needs must when the devil drives, my dear.
79) 14) dialog: I was going to make her star. But she chose the life of a housewife.
86) 3) dialog: So I read your finished treatment. "Taxi to -- " Where was it?
86) 7) dialog: That's it. Dubrovnik. Care to hear my opinion?
86) 16) dialog: There's no other way of saying it. It's stillborn. Dead in the water.
86) 21) dialog: (with mock compassion) The plot's a muddle. Some of the jokes are awfully like things we already did better hundreds of years ago in The Lady Vanishes. And your villain is weak. But the biggest failure is the relationship between the hero and heroine.
87) 3) dialog: Look at this mess.
89) 3) dialog: What's the hold-up? Call time was two hours ago.
92) 3) dialog: Good morning.
92) 19) dialog: Ah. There's our murderess.
92) 28) dialog: My mother used to say the same thing.
92) 74) dialog: Print. We've got it.
93) 3) dialog: Not now, Ed. It's really not a good time.
98) 10) dialog: I've told Peggy and now I'm going to tell you. You have to get this sequence shot today. What's the hold up?
98) 14) dialog: No. It has to be a high angle. You'll tip off the big surprise! Just get the process shot.
100) 5) dialog: Burning up our money. We're two days behind and I'm stuck in bed.
100) 10) dialog: To the set. We can't afford to lose any more time. Two more days of this and the whole production goes under.
100) 15) dialog: I'd hate to take you away from your writing partner.
102) 9) dialog: What do you mean?
106) 11) dialog: We're still two days behind and sixty thousand over budget.
106) 16) dialog: Beware -- all men are potential murderers.
106) 31) dialog: Spending a lot of time at the beach?
106) 36) dialog: Hardly the ideal setting to avoid distractions.
106) 40) dialog: I already told you -- that treatment is a waste of time.
106) 45) dialog: Are you and Whit having an affair?
106) 49) dialog: What a coincidence. I'm working on something new and I could use a little help too.
106) 60) dialog: Then why are you spending all hours of the day and night with some overage, talentless mamma's boy?
106) 65) dialog: I am under extraordinary pressures on this picture, the least you can do is give me your full support.
108) 18) dialog: Well, Vera. You always make it look so easy.
108) 26) dialog: Why didn't you stay with me? I would have made you as big a star as Grace Kelly.
108) 33) dialog: There was a time when I thought I understood you so completely -- understood women....
111) 5) dialog: What nudity? It was suggested.
111) 9) dialog: We did no such shot.
111) 20) dialog: I'll go over it frame by frame and set up another screening.
114) 17) dialog: Don't you get lonely out here sometimes?
115) 11) dialog: An odd little movie. Of course, Colbert is wonderful.
115) 24) dialog: Just like Barney Balaban's face.
117) 20) dialog: Except for you.
118) 9) dialog: We've seen the footage a thousand times. She doesn't blink.
119) 8) dialog: No, no, the second take, the light is better on his hands.
119) 13) dialog: Cut it tighter. The minute I lose one person I've lost the whole audience.
119) 26) dialog: Her breasts are very large, dear. It was a challenge not to show them.
122) 3) dialog: ...I don't want music in the shower murder.
122) 8) dialog: No. This isn't Vertigo, Bernie. This is different. The images have to work on their own.
123) 13) dialog: It's getting there.
124) 13) dialog: I take your opinion very seriously. But what you think you're seeing is purely informed by the power of suggestion. I assure you that once you view the final version with Mr. Herrmann's lovely, lyrical score...
124) 17) dialog: Would you mind if we had a word in private, Geoffrey?
124) 28) dialog: If only audiences could fully appreciate how tirelessly you work to help us entertain them while protecting them from filth and indecency.
125) 5) dialog: That I respected him. Deeply.
125) 13) dialog: No need. The charade is over.
125) 23) dialog: Worthy of a Purple Heart, my dear.
126) 4) dialog: I hope you don't mind, I told Mrs. Bates she could have your dressing room.
127) 3) dialog: We have our seal from Shurlock's office.
127) 9) dialog: Then we'd better get started. Peggy, take a memo...
132) 2) dialog: ... a fire escape or through a skylight, you will be ejected by brute force.
136) 22) dialog: Ready for the gallows?
137) 5) dialog: You go on ahead.
137) 9) dialog: I'll join you in a minute.
138) 3) dialog: (under his breath) But they're laughing too much.
140) 13) dialog: I promised Mother I wouldn't tell.
140) 18) dialog: Have her dry-cleaned.
140) 23) dialog: What did he say?
140) 27) dialog: "As we always knew..."
141) 6) dialog: Our career, Alma.
141) 14) dialog: And that, madame, is why they call me "The Master of Suspense"...
142) 38) dialog: And so, gentle viewer, Psycho -- the picture everyone predicted would bring me to wrack and ruin -- was such a hit that Alma and I got to... Well, let's just say that we got to keep our house -- and the swimming pool. And the same critics who despised it went on to call it one of my greatest achievements.
143) 3) dialog: But you know what they say in Hollywood: "You're only as good as your last picture." So, now, if you'll excuse me, I must toddle off to begin the exhaustive search for my next project.
