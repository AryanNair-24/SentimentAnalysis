4) 21) dialog: Muhammad had the eyes of peeping Toms gouged out with arrows.
4) 26) dialog: I doubt whether Mr. Weiler has had a climax in years.
4) 36) dialog: Don't be maudlin, you know how much it aggravates me.
4) 40) dialog: Stop reading them. You've been reading them for a week now.
4) 50) dialog: Yes. A true relic. And lest we forget, a notably corpulent one.
4) 55) dialog: Right between the shoulder blades. I learned it from your pictures.
4) 60) dialog: I'm seeing Whit for brunch after I drop you off at the studio. Why don't you join us?
4) 64) dialog: You'll feel better as soon as you find a project. Hasn't Peggy unearthed any decent books yet?
4) 69) dialog: Well?
4) 80) dialog: 
4) 83) dialog: Hurry up, darling. You're pruning.
6) 3) dialog: There's a story out there waiting for you somewhere, Hitch. I promise.
6) 6) dialog: Don't forget your lunch.
8) 6) dialog: Serves you right.
8) 9) dialog: Hitch always said your private life was in danger of being more entertaining than any of your plots.
8) 18) dialog: All this relentless sycophancy is giving me indigestion.
8) 25) dialog: 
8) 29) dialog: And how is your wife?
8) 33) dialog: Hitch is going out of his mind looking for his next project. You know how unbearable he is when he doesn't have something lined up.
8) 37) dialog: 
8) 42) dialog: I'm satisfied spending time in my garden.
8) 50) dialog: Ah. All is finally revealed.
8) 63) dialog: I suppose I could give it a look.
11) 5) dialog: Hungry?
11) 19) dialog: Whit gave me the galleys of his new book yesterday at lunch. I've already got some ideas on how you could adapt it.
11) 22) dialog: It's elegant, sophisticated, full of
11) 28) dialog: This might be the one, Alfred.
11) 34) dialog: There are calories in that, you know.
13) 3) dialog: Oh God.
13) 8) dialog: Now?
13) 11) dialog: "Mary started to scream, and then the curtains parted further and a hand appeared, holding a butcher's knife. It was the knife that, a moment later, cut off her scream... and her head." (handing him back the book) Charming. Doris Day should do it as a musical.
13) 14) dialog: This is nothing but low-budget horror movie claptrap.
14) 14) dialog: Actually, I think it's a huge mistake.
14) 17) dialog: You shouldn't wait till halfway through... Kill her off after 30 minutes.
16) 63) dialog: You don't have to pretend you're not upset he hasn't read it yet, you know.
16) 67) dialog: Well, I loved it. What terrific fun it must have been to research.
20) 3) dialog: You're back early.
20) 6) dialog: I'm disappointed you didn't give Whit's book a chance.
20) 10) dialog: He knows you well enough.
20) 16) dialog: Why?
20) 30) dialog: Why not wait?
20) 36) dialog: Are we going to have to sell the entire house or just the pool?
20) 40) dialog: Tell me and I won't ever ask again. Why this one, Hitch? It's not just because so many people are telling you 'no,' is it?
20) 43) dialog: Hitch?
23) 5) dialog: The movie will be splendid.
23) 9) dialog: Of the movie? Not in the least. But of you? Unquestionably.
25) 5) dialog: Stop waffling, Donald. Give it to me straight.
25) 16) dialog: Where do you suggest we cut?
26) 7) dialog: We're about to have dinner. You don't need anything else.
26) 13) dialog: Hire him.
28) 6) dialog: Whatever you do, Alfred, don't lose your temper.
33) 16) dialog: Unlike certain people we could mention.
33) 19) dialog: Think of the duality he could bring to Norman. The rage lurking behind that little-boy-lost grin. The winsome charm he uses to keep from being found out.
35) 6) dialog: Stop grumbling. A bit of fresh air and exercise is exactly what you need.
35) 18) dialog: Well you can't. She's a princess now which makes her permanently unattainable.
35) 24) dialog: Lew suggested Deborah Kerr.
35) 29) dialog: What about Janet Leigh? She's always the `good girl' but she did awfully well in Touch of Evil. Lew mentioned her name. Do you remember how you always remarked on her figure at the Wassermans' parties?
37) 21) dialog: You're not the only one. (to the waiter) We're fine, thank you.
37) 49) dialog: You and the Shurlock Office.
37) 72) dialog: If you'll excuse me.
38) 6) dialog: Oh, come off it, old girl.
38) 11) dialog: Hello Lillian.
38) 24) dialog: Don't upset yourself, darling. It's only a bloody movie.
40) 4) dialog: I've made a list of places where we can tighten our belt.
40) 7) dialog: It wouldn't hurt for us all to learn the art of self restraint.
40) 12) dialog: There aren't any other places. And furthermore, they'll be no more shipments from Maxim's either. We can't afford it.
40) 15) dialog: The foie gras at Chasen's is more than adequate.
40) 25) dialog: We all have to make our little sacrifices for the greater good, don't we, Alfred?
43) 17) dialog: Oh, shut up. Just get the first take under your belt you'll be fine.
59) 5) dialog: The people who matter know. That's all that counts.
60) 6) dialog: Whit.
60) 10) dialog: I've been doing the revisions on...
60) 23) dialog: In a state of unbridled ecstacy now that he's back on the set.
60) 27) dialog: Not bad. I've got eight hundred words to do for Reader's Digest on what it's like to be married to a man obsessed by murder.
63) 6) dialog: No. Actually, I'm back sooner than I expected.
63) 12) dialog: No. (he starts to head off) And you shouldn't either.
63) 15) dialog: Those haven't been washed yet.
63) 30) dialog: You should tell Whit that. He'd be flattered.
64) 11) dialog: I'll see how my day shapes up.
71) 5) dialog: What would I do without you?
71) 10) dialog: 
75) 12) dialog: It's so nice not to have to take care of someone, even if it's just for an hour or two.
75) 15) dialog: Whit, where are we going? You still haven't told me.
75) 19) dialog: A surprise. How fun.
78) 12) dialog: I don't mind that he uses his obsession to fuel his art. I just don't like it when he uses it against me.
78) 17) dialog: Did you know when we started out I was his boss? He didn't even dare ask me out until he'd worked his way up to assistant director.
78) 23) dialog: Looks nice. Terrific location. Why?
78) 28) dialog: I just saw Elizabeth. Why on earth didn't she tell me?
80) 5) dialog: Very Bohemian.
80) 10) dialog: Whit. I hope you haven't got the wrong idea.
86) 5) dialog: Dubrovnik.
86) 9) dialog: Yes. Naturally.
86) 19) dialog: How so?
86) 30) dialog: How would you know what really goes on between a man and a woman?
87) 15) dialog: 
91) 3) dialog: Forget what Hitch said. He's just feeling his age. He'll come around.
91) 8) dialog: So why don't we put some in?
91) 11) dialog: All we need is a better catalyst. Some innocuous little trigger to release all that underlying desire.
95) 5) dialog: Even better, what if they reached for the cab door at exactly the same time?
95) 8) dialog: That way, we could start close on the hands... (tracking the movement) ... and then tilt up to the eyes.
95) 14) dialog: Are you going to get that?
100) 3) dialog: No more phone calls. You're burning up.
100) 8) dialog: Where do you think you're going?
100) 13) dialog: You stay in bed. I'll deal with it.
100) 23) dialog: Under the blankets. Now.
101) 4) dialog: Don't stop work because of me. I'm only here as one of the two people paying your salaries.
101) 7) dialog: Scene?
101) 11) dialog: Storyboards?
101) 14) dialog: Start with the overhead. We'll cut before the fall. Then we'll put Martin in a chair under the camera.
101) 17) dialog: (to the cameraman) And that lens should be a thirty-five.
104) 3) dialog: Barney.
104) 15) dialog: That won't be necessary.
104) 29) dialog: Thank you for your concern, Barney.
104) 32) dialog: But on a Hitchcock picture, there is only one director.
105) 10) dialog: That's kind of you.
105) 15) dialog: Janet, you've been very... professional. It hasn't gone unappreciated.
106) 3) dialog: May I turn that down?
106) 6) dialog: You'll be pleased to know order has been restored.
106) 9) dialog: A thank you would be nice.
106) 13) dialog: I already cancelled the wrap party. That'll save us two thousand right there. And you won't be tempted by any champagne and cake.
106) 28) dialog: Alright, what's this about?
106) 34) dialog: That's where Whit and I are writing. He's rented a place.
106) 38) dialog: Actually, it's very conducive to creative collaboration.
106) 42) dialog: Didn't everyone say the same thing about "Psycho"?
106) 47) dialog: Don't be absurd. He's working on something new and needs a little help, that's all.
106) 51) dialog: What do you think I've been doing?
106) 62) dialog: Because it's fun.
106) 67) dialog: Full support? We've mortgaged our house. My house.
106) 70) dialog: Might I remind you that I have weighed-in on every aspect of this film so far, as I have done on every picture you've done in the last three decades. And the first time you show the film, it will be my notes that you want. I celebrate with you if the reviews are good and I cry for you if they are not. I host your parties and put up with those fantasy romances with your leading ladies. And when you're out promoting this film around the world, I will stand beside or, rather, slightly behind you, smiling endlessly for the press even when I'm ready to drop, being gracious to people who look through me as if I were invisible because all they can see is the grand and glorious "Alfred Hitchcock."
106) 73) dialog: Now, for the first time in years, I dare to work on something that isn't "an Alfred Hitchcock Production" and I'm met with accusation and criticisms. This work I'm doing with Whit gives me pleasure and purpose.
106) 82) dialog: And even though that takes absolutely nothing away from you, please consider this a reminder: I am your wife, Alma Reville, not one of the contract blondes you badger and torment with your oh-so- specific direction.
109) 12) dialog: I thought you rented this place so we could write.
109) 19) dialog: Don't worry. I won't tell Elizabeth.
109) 34) dialog: Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, Whit.
112) 3) dialog: Is there anything else we can do?
112) 14) dialog: Well, it is only a house.
115) 16) dialog: Cold and miserable.
117) 5) dialog: I don't think I can stand both of us being maudlin.
117) 8) dialog: There is one solution to all this, you know.
117) 11) dialog: We could both get to work -- together.
117) 14) dialog: That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation I've been helping Whit finish is done.
117) 17) dialog: So I suggest, for everyone's sake, we start whipping Psycho into shape tomorrow. You may not be the easiest man to live with but you know how to cut a picture better than anyone.
118) 7) dialog: You'll need to cut those six or seven frames where she blinks after she's supposed to be dead.
119) 5) dialog: 
119) 10) dialog: 
119) 24) dialog: You imp. You got nudity in there.
122) 16) dialog: You can't scare people just by going, "Boo!" You have to tell them what's coming, make them anticipate it --
132) 5) dialog: More playful, darling.
136) 3) dialog: Well, at least there are some people here.
137) 7) dialog: Are you sure?
137) 14) dialog: Fine, darling. I'll save you a seat.
141) 4) dialog: This could be the biggest hit of your career, Alfred.
141) 11) dialog: You do realize I've been waiting decades to hear you say that.
