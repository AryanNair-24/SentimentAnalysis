One sits at an upright piano playing of all things STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT. Another one sits on a couch talking to a Wall Street Broker who is spending his lunch hour. KLUTE finds himself staring down into a pile of pornography magazines on the coffee table. BREE is amused at his discomfort. JANIE DALE, the madame, who has been on the phone in the back, puts the receiver down and crosses to the girl on the couch. JANIE looks and talks a bit like Lauren Bacall.
76) 1) dialog: (to girl on couch) It's old Mr. Clean from Cleveland. He wants to know when he can fly in and clean up the apartment and see you. I told him I have all the cleaning equipment and that he can come anytime, but it's up to you. GIRL on couch rises.
76) 3) dialog: Tell him that he'd better have his ass in here by one o'clock on Monday afternoon or you won't let him clean the bathroom floor, and tell him the price has gone up twenty bucks -- Old Dutcn Cleanser's not as cheap as it used to be. She shrugs and turns to KLUTE &amp; BREE.
76) 4) dialog: You wanted to know about Arlyn, honey? I had to let her go dear. Arlyn stopped being reliable. (explains to Klute) I deal with a high type client, business people, you understand? I can't send them someone that's all the time half zonked out.
76) 6) dialog: Try Momma Reese.

This streetwalker world is far removed from the world of the call girl or the world of Janie Dale. CAMERA pans past a group of pimps at the bar taking bet on whose girls have made the most money that night. CAMERA then goes on to reveal KLUTE talking to another pimp (Azure). Azure represents a clear step down from Frank Ligourin.  We catch only part of their dialogue.
