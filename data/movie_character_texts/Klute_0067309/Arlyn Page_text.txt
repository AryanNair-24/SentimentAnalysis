83) 0) text: The retching sounds are coming from the connecting room. No one visible here. A very few barren pieces of furniture. We hear ARLYN'S VOICE ask from the next room --
83) 1) dialog: Cappy? ARLYN enters rather eagerly. She sees Klute first, then Bree -- recognizes her -- retires flat against a wall, holding one palm outwards to shield her face. She is unbelievably gaunt. Inside one elbow, looking rather like a birthmark, we see a lacework of purple where her veins have pulped together.
83) 6) dialog: No -- We hear the MUMBLE and WHISPER of their voices from the connecting room (as she reassures him). Bree looks inquiringly at Klute (is that Grunemann?): he shakes his head. Pause, then ARLYN reenters, wrapping her fingers together timidly -- wanting them out -- her only purpose.
83) 7) dialog: Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
83) 9) dialog: Can't you see I'm strung out? (cries out) Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!
83) 12) dialog: Please, if he sees you, he won't come!

83) 16) dialog: No. He was an older man hon. The dumper was older.

83) 24) dialog: It's all right, they're all right -- -- turns and runs.

84) 1) dialog: Oh baby -- no it's all right -- oh my baby baby baby -- Klute and Bree are only a half-step behind. Klute offers to assist: Arlyn puts him away ferociously.
84) 2) dialog: Get out! (to Berger, again) Don't cry my baby; I'll find him, I'll get it. Baby, baby, don't cry. (to Klute savagely, incoherently) Leave us alone! Get out and get out and leave us alone! (to Berger) My honey, my baby, my baby -- We DISSOLVE TO --
