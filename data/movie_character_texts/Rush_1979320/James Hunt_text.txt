Newspapers with headlines about the Dockers Strike, Engla crumbling economy, Rolls Royce being bailed out by the government - subtle reminders of Britain in transition, leaving behind its strong, imperial past. JAMES and the NURSE stand against the wall, still half- dressed, but already passionately making love...
7) 1) dialog: I have a theory why women like racing drivers. It's not because they respect what we do...driving round and round in circles. Mostly they think that's pathetic. And they're probably right.. (a beat) It's our closeness to death.
7) 2) text: JAMES and the NURSE continue noisily, tirelessly making l in the shower...
7) 3) dialog: The closer you are to death, the more alive you FEEL...the more alive you ARE. And they can see that in you. FEEL that in you. The way you live. Willing to risk everything.

I have a hot head, an inability to tolerate discipline. I fall out with people left and right. I'm quick to settle matters with my fists. The only creatures I've ever loved and treated well, are budgerigars. In any normal area of life, I'd be...or AM...a total liability. All I've got going for me is I'm quick in a car.

44) 8) dialog: No. Just a little coffin, surrounded by high-octane fuel, being driven round at 170 miles per hour..
44) 13) dialog: No one wants it to be. It's like saying why not make bullfighting safer? It's a blood sport. The risk of death turns people on. Without it, I guess, it'd be half the fun. Which is fine for the voyeurs, fine for TV, fine for everyone.. (a beat) ...except us drivers.
