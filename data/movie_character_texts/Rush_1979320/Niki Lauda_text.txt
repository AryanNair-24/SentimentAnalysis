117) 2) dialog: Fine.
117) 6) dialog: Sure. I had a skin graft operation where they put half my right thigh in my face. It doesn't look too good but one unexpected advantage is it's impossible to perspire through a skin graft, so sweat will never run in my eyes again - which is good for a driver. Laughter. At the back of the hall, JAMES HUNT creeps in, (unseen by anyone, disguised in a hat), to listen.
117) 8) dialog: Ja. Before even my first operation.
