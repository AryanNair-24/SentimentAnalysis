52) 1) dialog: Hey, Boychik. A low flying 747 lets us know he lives too close to the airport in a small house.
52) 2) dialog: That's the eleven o'clock from London. (yells up at the plane) Drop something valuable, you shit. (back to Pete) How are you?
52) 4) dialog: Every eight minutes, buddy.
53) 0) text: Pete sits down and talks with Larry.
53) 1) dialog: You look pretty good. Your hair is different.
53) 4) dialog: I'd get it cut.
53) 6) dialog: I do but right now look who I'm talking to. It's your brother.
53) 8) dialog: I told you honey, that's because of the egg donor. Remember?
53) 11) dialog: It's not good. Nobody wants curtains. They think of it like a luxury. It's not a luxury. You need shade, you need privacy. Who wants to have other people watch you fuck?
53) 14) dialog: Be careful, don't jump on Daddy. Remember, Daddy has high blood what?
53) 16) dialog: That's right. Can you go outside without me for a little bit?
53) 19) dialog: All right? Do the Three Stooges routine you were practicing. The three exit.
53) 20) dialog: I can't tell them apart. I swear to god. I need tattoos.
53) 22) dialog: I think that house is more than you need. I think it was too big of a purchase when you made it.
53) 24) dialog: What do you mean?
53) 26) dialog: Oh. I'm sorry, what?
53) 28) dialog: No, that's a bad idea. That's not the way to cut back. I have three children, here.
53) 30) dialog: Claire takes care of your brothers. What do you want her to do? If she goes to work, then I've got to hire somebody.
53) 33) dialog: Okay, fine. Why don't we kill them? Come on, we'll kill two of them. I'll keep the best one. Really, it will save us both a lot of trouble. Larry stands up and walks outside. Pete follows.
54) 0) text: Larry prepares to spray the kids with the hose.
54) 1) dialog: Line up! Line up for murder! Come on! Who wants to be killed?
54) 3) dialog: Okay, we're eliminating one, we're cheaper already. Larry sprays him with the hose.
54) 5) dialog: Boom, dead. You're dead.
54) 7) dialog: All right, the kids are murdered. That will save us some money.
54) 9) dialog: Because Claire wanted a baby. If we didn't at least try, she would have left me. She was forty-five years old. Nobody thought it would take.
54) 12) dialog: The doctor when we were doing in vitro was winking at me like, "Don't worry, don't worry." We were very unlucky. And now we have these three beautiful children... Come on, I've got to tell you something.
55) 2) dialog: Your mother wanted you aborted.
55) 4) dialog: It's the truth. It was the seventies. We were twenty-two years old. That's what everybody did. You did some blow, had sex, had an abortion.
55) 6) dialog: Yes. We were on the way to the doctor's office. I said, "Let's stop, have a pizza, talk about it, if you still want to do it after lunch, it's okay." The pizza saved your life. But don't give me money. Because I'm not worth it.
55) 8) dialog: I don't have a number. You just keep giving like you're giving. Larry's wife, CLAIRE, enters.
55) 11) dialog: We were playing with them all day. Pete's just talking to me about his fortieth birthday party... Whatever I can do to help.
55) 13) dialog: I fed half of one. Okay, let's feed them. Who wants tuna with a side of jet fuel? Larry gets up and walks outside.
73) 1) text: Larry and Debbie greet the kids when they enter the kitch Larry picks up one of the triplets.
73) 2) dialog: Did you miss me Travis?
73) 4) dialog: Hey, Jack.
73) 8) dialog: Go play with your tiny uncles. (to Debbie) So, what are you doing, spring cleaning?
73) 11) dialog: Why? What's wrong with gluten?
73) 13) dialog: I don't think so. It's wheat.
73) 15) dialog: As in the Wizard of?
73) 20) dialog: Remember the Alamo?
73) 23) dialog: I will take this if you're going to throw it away, because at our house, we're wheat eaters.
73) 25) dialog: That's up to god, honey.
73) 28) dialog: The kids eat grass. This is fine. Larry takes some of the food she's throwing out.
73) 34) dialog: Let me just grab the candy worms.
73) 43) dialog: The nougat things are good.
73) 51) dialog: Kids! Time to go!
73) 54) dialog: She's a little pip. Just like her mommy. So I might have a job tomorrow, at least I'm going to go try to give an estimate. Do you mind taking the kids for a couple hours?
73) 57) dialog: This is nice. You and I don't spend enough time together, do we?
73) 59) dialog: We do?
73) 61) dialog: Then we do. I'll go with what you think.
82) 0) text: Larry answers the door. Pete is there with a framed drawi made by John Lennon.
83) 1) dialog: I took a late shower. Why are you busting my balls? Look, I'm sorry about the record. You're going through financial shit. This is what I live with. This is a horrible time in human history. What is that?
83) 5) dialog: I don't want this. I don't even like it. I'm not going to hang it up.
83) 7) dialog: Well, you're not giving me money. You're giving me a project. I don't know how to sell this. I'm not an art dealer.
83) 9) dialog: All right. Don't get snippy. Just because you write a great song doesn't mean you can draw.
83) 11) dialog: I think it's a Ringo. Don't beat me up if I get three hundred dollars for it.
83) 13) dialog: Okay.
83) 16) dialog: What should I bring? You want wine or something?
83) 18) dialog: That's mean.
83) 20) dialog: All right. Bye... How do I call eBay?
121) 8) dialog: Hello everyone! I'm sorry we're late. I was in the lab cloning myself. We're going to have another seven more tomorrow... Look, we cut their hair different so we can finally tell who they are. Larry lifts one of the triplets up and down by the arms, simulating an elevator.
121) 9) dialog: You like the new haircut, Travis?
121) 11) dialog: Of course you are. Larry puts Jack down and he runs off.
121) 13) dialog: Really? How are you?
121) 15) dialog: Oliver. "Can I have some more? Please, Oliver, I need a little morsel." I love that movie. You must get that all the time.
121) 19) dialog: We won't see her now for the whole day. I'd help honey, but I've got the blood pressure, and I don't want to.
121) 21) dialog: Yeah, a little white wine.
121) 23) dialog: So, who knew that Debbie had a dad! Where have you been for fifteen years? Never seen you at Hanukkah, Christmas, Ramadan, nothing. How do you get out of all that stuff? Do you have a wife?
121) 27) dialog: You let the woman sand the deck?
121) 31) dialog: Look how big the kids are. Sadie! He gives Desi a hug.
121) 33) dialog: (to Sadie) Hi, Sadie.
121) 44) dialog: That was deeply uncomfortable. Thank god the pretty girl was here to divert our attention.
123) 0) text: Larry is talking to Oliver.
123) 2) dialog: So, spinal surgery just seems to me to be at the top of the surgery chain.
123) 4) dialog: Do you operate every single day?
123) 6) dialog: Multiple times a day?
123) 8) dialog: So what's the price range? Like if I wanted--
123) 10) dialog: It's so big you're embarrassed to say.
123) 12) dialog: Are there hunchbacks today?
123) 14) dialog: I've never seen one.
123) 16) dialog: That's because of you. Each time I don't see a hunchback, you're getting that much richer.
123) 18) dialog: You like The Beatles, don't you?
123) 20) dialog: Nobody.
125) 0) text: Debbie, Pete, Larry, Oliver, Barb and Barry are eating.
125) 4) dialog: Wait. Forgive who?
125) 7) dialog: But specifically who are you forgiving? I like to know the details before I toast.
125) 10) dialog: I see. I know you have some issues with me, but I'm curious, what's he in for? Before today nobody even knew he existed.
125) 13) dialog: I know what she meant.
127) 1) dialog: When was the last time you two saw each other, if you don't mind me asking?
127) 4) dialog: And before that?
127) 6) dialog: Seven years? That's a joke, right? That's like two Olympics. And I'm the bad guy. What Debbie doesn't understand is that it's not bad to help out a parent. And it's certainly not bad for a parent to help out a child. I'm sure Oliver would agree.
127) 8) dialog: Am I doing what? I didn't start the toast.
127) 10) dialog: What? He does four operations a day. It's perfect. It helps everybody, and it relieves his guilt from all the abandonment issues.
127) 17) dialog: What do you want me to do? Admit that my life is shit? Is that what you want me to say? You happy? Aren't I allowed a little joy with these children I never wanted to have?
127) 19) dialog: Family helps family.
127) 22) dialog: I just figured out what your problem is. You hate Jews. Which is so odd because your children are Jewish.
127) 24) dialog: I'm not playing any Jew card.
127) 26) dialog: You can't use up a Jew card. That's the whole point of a Jew card.
127) 32) dialog: See you when the Cubs win the Pennant.
127) 34) dialog: Maybe we should try the toast again.
130) 34) dialog: Hey! We just heard. You're having a baby! See, it can happen to anybody.
132) 0) text: Larry and Claire walk away as Pete storms in.
133) 12) dialog: Hi, guys. Some of us need to leave. Would this be a good moment to sneak out? From the side of the house we see Pete storming by on his bike, wearing his street clothes and a helmet.
139) 0) text: Debbie drives around the neighborhood with Larry in the passenger seat.
139) 1) dialog: Are you mad at me? Did I say something?
145) 1) dialog: Are you sure that's him? I don't think that's him.
147) 0) text: Debbie and Larry sit in the waiting area of the hospital.
147) 2) dialog: I guess the party didn't turn out like you planned.
147) 7) dialog: You know Pete was never a real fighter. But that's why he married you. That's why he loves you. Because you're the fighter, and you need that. One person in a relationship has got to punch.
147) 9) dialog: Oh, it's a high compliment.
147) 11) dialog: Listen, I know what you're worried about. You think he's going to turn into me, but I don't think it's going to happen. He's smarter and probably a little cuter. A little less Jewy. Although, after fifty, that's all going to change. Be prepared to wake up one day with a a rabbi. But the good news is, he'll love you forever. That's in our DNA. We stick around.
147) 14) dialog: I know. I just don't have anyone else to talk to about it.
147) 16) dialog: No. If I open up to her she'll leave me.
147) 18) dialog: I know, but there's a certain point at which you just can't stay. (beat) I guess it's hard to forgive somebody if they don't formally apologize to you.
147) 20) dialog: I'm very close. (beat) Yes, I'm sorry. And I'm glad everybody's okay.
147) 22) dialog: I'm off.
147) 24) dialog: This is awkward.
147) 27) dialog: I need forty dollars for a cab.
147) 29) dialog: No, I'm not kidding. You drove me. I wasn't prepared.
147) 31) dialog: That's okay. I'll bring you the change. He grabs the bill out of her purse and walks off.
147) 32) dialog: All right, give him a kiss for me.
