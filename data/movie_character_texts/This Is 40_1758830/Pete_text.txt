19) 11) dialog: Give me a break.
19) 13) dialog: It's not my instinct to escape from you. It is my instinct to come into the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom.

The crowd applauds as Graham Parker (60's) leaps on stage Pete and Debbie watch Graham sing a very moving song. The song is fantastic and personal, but clearly not commercia We watch Debbie. Although the music is great, it's a litt depressing and not working on her. She quickly gets bored

29) 24) dialog: You know what, enough of who fucked who and who finished what.
29) 27) dialog: Look. It's a retro label. That's our niche. That's our market. It costs money to break new bands, I can't do that.
29) 29) dialog: Everyone turned down Arcade Fire.
29) 31) dialog: We don't have the money to market a new band. We just need to make Graham seem relevant. Who is he talking to?
29) 33) dialog: The Jewish Journal?
29) 37) dialog: What is he wearing?
29) 40) dialog: Why?
29) 42) dialog: Look. The Paul Westerberg record did okay. Frank Black did all right. The Haircut 100, not so much. We have to break this record. Otherwise, we're not here next year.

30) 15) dialog: Yeah, that's good. You should do that.
30) 17) dialog: Yeah, I think it would be good if you could take care of your anger.
30) 19) dialog: That's what I said. Our anger.
30) 22) dialog: Yeah, you've got to cut that out.
30) 24) dialog: Sorry.
30) 26) dialog: So, you're saying that if we're arguing and I apologize, you'll let it go and not throw it back in my face later?
30) 28) dialog: All of that. That's plenty. That's a lot.
30) 30) dialog: Oh, yeah. I've been doing a decent job, but I don't think there's anything wrong with having some fries every now and again.

31) 14) dialog: We really need the store to work.
31) 16) dialog: That's not what I mean.
31) 18) dialog: Yeah. Maybe we just suck it up because she's clearly earning so much more than any other employee we have.
31) 20) dialog: That's why we have to keep her. We watch the footage and suddenly Desi's BOYFRIEND enters walks behind the counter, and she sits on his lap. She adjusts herself.
31) 24) dialog: That might be like a dry hump.
31) 26) dialog: That's too grainy to know for sure. Oh my god, this is the middle of the day. Customers could be in there.
31) 28) dialog: What did you say? "At least she's getting some"?
31) 30) dialog: What are you talking about? We had sex the other night. You have to give me a little credit for that.
31) 32) dialog: That's not passion.
31) 34) dialog: What-- Pete farts.

62) 43) dialog: Should we get a block of porn?
62) 46) dialog: Yeah, but you know, two porns cost about as much as a block.

78) 8) dialog: You're supposed to call the companies, you're supposed to get people to the show!
78) 10) dialog: What should we do? I'm out of ideas.
78) 12) dialog: With what? I can't afford it.
78) 14) dialog: What did you call me?
78) 17) dialog: Don't talk to me about responsibilities. I have a life. I have a family. I can't afford to sit in my apartment getting high, jerking off, and then going to Tommy's Chili Burgers at three in the morning.
