27) 10) dialog: How are you? I'm so happy about the science fair. It's going very well I heard. I love you. You look so beautiful. Happy birthday! I just learned it's your fortieth. Are you forty?
27) 12) dialog: I remember when I was forty, and then I blinked and there I was, going to be ninety. My god, where did it go? One day you're going to blink, and you're going to be ninety, and I won't be around to see it. And that makes me very sad. I'm telling you, I'm warning you. Don't blink. Don't blink.
