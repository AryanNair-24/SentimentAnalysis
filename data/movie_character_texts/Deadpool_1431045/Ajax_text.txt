FOUR LARGE ALUMINUM CARGO CRATES sit beside hi Ajax squints into the sun as A BELL HELICOPTER thrashes t air above him, kicking up dust as it lands.
4) 4) dialog: (bangs crate)
4) 7) dialog: There won't be one. Demand is high. You aren't the only one with a war to win.
4) 9) text: That won't do. Both sets of armed thugs shift to ready positions. Ajax smiles calmly, but his free hand DARTS OUT and CASUA LIFTS the warlord into the air by the THROAT. Fingers fin triggers on both sides.
4) 10) dialog: There's been a small... disruption in our supply chain. We'll deliver in full the following month. Say, ten percent off for the inconvenience? The Warlord manages to nod in acquiescence.       Ajax sm again, lowers him gasping to the ground.
4) 11) dialog: We appreciate your business. Ajax spins and walks purposefully toward the line of wait SUV's. The warlord angrily motions for his men to begin loading crates into the helicopter, which they do.
22) 3) dialog: Actually, I do.
22) 5) text: A massive SHADOW passes over AJAX and DEADPOOL, accompani by LOUD METALLIC FOOTSTEPS. Ajax looks up, a bit awed.
32) 6) text: Deadpool lasers in on AJAX's picture at the top of the pyramid.
35) 22) dialog: Patience, Angel. All in good time. Enter AJAX, whom we know as the PRISONER from the RAFT wi whom we've seen Deadpool tangle in the PRESENT. This is t first Ajax and Wade have met.
35) 27) dialog: You're a talker. Wade's eyes are wider than ever.    WTF?
35) 28) dialog: (disarmingly matter-of-fact)
35) 29) text: Mr. Wilson, my name is Ajax. I manage the Workshop. My `welcome' speech used to be full of euphemisms like `You may feel some discomfort.' But I've grown blunt. Ajax unsheathes an I.V. NEEDLE. Angel Dust up-tilts the table 45 degrees, then readies a holographic monitor.
35) 30) dialog: The Workshop is not a government program. It's a private institution tasked with turning reclamation projects like yourself into men of extraordinary abilities. I'm about to remake your life. But if you think cancer cures painlessly, you're wrong. If you think super-human powers are acquired painlessly, you're wrong. Ajax touches Wade with the I.V. NEEDLE, pressing here and there, not QUITE hard enough to break skin. At last, he locates the subclavian vein. Wade flinches.
35) 31) dialog: We're injecting you with a serum that activates mutant genes. For it to work, we need to subject you to extreme stress. The liquid glows FLUORESCENT through Wade's white skin as pumps into the pulmonary highway.
35) 32) dialog: You've heard the whole make-an-omelette, break-some-eggs bit? (Wade blinks)
35) 38) dialog: One more thing. What's the ad? `I'm not just the president. I'm a client?' I've been through this procedure myself. It made me stronger. It also scorched my nerve endings. So I no longer feel pain. In fact... (smiles)
35) 39) text: I no longer feel anything. Wade reacts by SAYING something - made UNINTELLIGIBLE by surgical tubing. Ajax nods to Angel Dust, who slices the SURGICAL TUBING, SNAPPING it away and FREEING Wade to TAL
35) 43) dialog: Joke away. The one thing that never survives this place is a sense of humor.
35) 45) dialog: (to Angel Dust)
36) 0) text: A MONTAGE of Wade's treatments in the Workshop, set to th notes of JOHN DENVER's inspirational classic, `I WANT TO LIVE.' Juxtaposed with HARROWING VIGNETTES of Angel Dust AJAX experimenting on WADE... ...as he GASPS, CLAWS, SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER. Wade is DUNKED into thick, molasses-like LIQUID. PULLED a YANKED, POKED and PRODDED by contraptions that would have shamed the Spanish Inquisition. SAWED.   COMPRESSED.     SLICED.   DICED.   SLAP-CHOPPED. LONG SYRINGES PLUNGE DEEP INTO SOFT TISSUE. SCALPELS MAKE LONG INCISIONS.
37) 2) dialog: The serum I'm injecting you with targets any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.
37) 4) dialog: Adrenaline acts as a catalyst for the serum, so we must subject you to extreme stress.
37) 8) dialog: If you're lucky, the mutant genes will activate and manifest in spectacular fashion.
37) 9) dialog: If not, we'll have no choice but to keep hurting you in new and different ways. Each more painful than the last.
38) 1) dialog: Until you finally mutate.      Or die.
39) 18) dialog: With the mouse ears? Creative, and delicious.
39) 19) text: AJAX and ANGEL DUST enter CUNNINGHAM's tent and begin prepping him for a fresh round of torture.
39) 20) dialog: It's OK, I encourage distractions. Can't have you giving up on us, can we now, you little worm?
39) 23) text: Ajax is very subtly SURPRISED.      WHAT did Wade just sa is still strapped down inside.      Talking nice and LOUD
39) 25) text: Ajax has ENTERED Wade's tent. Ajax's expression tells us we need to know about the validity of Wade's claim. With as much freedom of motion as he has in one hand, Wad WAVES a STUB of PAPER at Francis.
39) 32) dialog: You are so relentlessly annoying. Shut the fuck up, or I'll sew that pretty mouth shut.
39) 34) dialog: Is that what you think?
40) 0) text: Two ORDERLIES and ANGEL DUST finish strapping Wade down a attaching ELECTRODES to his head and chest. Wade is BOUND a HOSPITAL BED that's ENCASED in a large CAPSULE of PLEXIGLAS. The top half of the capsule is hinged to one side, OPEN, allowing Angel Dust access to Wade. Ajax sits eating a meal from some Tupperware in a nearby chair.
40) 1) dialog: Seems your genes are as stubborn as you. But we can still increase your suffering. We don't even have a name for this next toy. Various WIRES and TUBES run out of the capsule, connected OXYGEN TANKS, DIALS, and a MONITOR tracking BRAIN and HEA
40) 2) dialog: We reduce the oxygen in the air to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating.
40) 7) dialog: If you start to pass out, and your brain waves slow, we turn up the O2. If you catch your breath, and your heart rate slows, we turn it back down. And we leave you. Right. There.
40) 9) dialog: Waterboarding is the most severe stress known to man. This device prolongs that stress. For hours, days, weeks...
40) 13) dialog: The saddest part? You still think we're making you a super-hero. You. Dishonorable discharge. Beating up pizza guys. Hip deep in hookers. You're nothing. I'd call you an asshole, but I'd have to answer to assholes. Little secret, Wade. The Workshop doesn't make super-heroes. It makes super-slaves. We're gonna fit you for a control collar and auction you to the highest bidder. (finishes meal, gets up) Who knows what they'll force you to do. Put down freedom fighters. Murder innocents. Or maybe just mow a lawn or two.
40) 15) text: Ajax goes to close the lid.
40) 17) dialog: Enjoy the weekend!
40) 23) dialog: (bright idea)
41) 16) text: Who appears over the PUNCH-BOWL but... ...AJAX.
41) 20) dialog: Oo. Someone lost his shot at homecoming king.
41) 22) dialog: No. Not fair. Everything I've done to you has been in your best interest. Even this next bit. You may be cured, but you still need to learn to be a better man. Polite. Respectful. What better way to teach you than to close this lid... and keep torturing you stupid. Ajax SLAMS the lid shut, LATCHES and LOCKS it. The hissin resumes. Wade's eyes grow wide. He starts to slip-slide toward absolute ANGUISH.
42) 0) text: Back in the PRESENT, we find ourselves in a huge SCRAP-YA where various ships, planes, etc. are sold for scrap iron Among various vehicles is an OLD, BATTERED COMBAT CARRIER long given up for dead. A heavy truck navigates through the heaps of scrap-metal grinds to a stop in front of the carrier. Two heavyset MEN climb down and head toward the back of t truck, heave the heavy door open. AJAX and ANGEL DUST stand just inside, boxes and gear pil up behind them. They hop down as four more rough-looking pile out behind them. Angel Dust drags out a WOODEN CRATE. The planks crunch as she digs her fingers into the wood and heaves it up on on burly shoulder as if it weighed no more than a sack of fl Heavy AMMO peeks through.
42) 2) text: Ajax and Angel Dust walk across the muddy yard toward a service elevator bolted to the rusting hulk of the carrie
42) 3) dialog: Either I kill him, or he kills me.     Let's put him out of our misery...
47) 0) text: WADE, newly scarred, hidden in darkness, continues to GAS though being held underwater. Then the lid on the punch-b SLIDES BACK, revealing AJAX. Wade takes deep LUNGS-FUL of AIR. Ajax leans in for a closer look.
47) 1) dialog: Bloody hell. Someone lost his shot at homecoming king.
47) 4) dialog: You give me too much credit. This... this is the result of your genes.
47) 9) dialog: The punch bowl merely raised your stress to trigger the mutation.
47) 11) dialog: Where's the gratitude?! You're cured! Your mutated cells can heal anything. They're attacking the cancer as fast as it can form. Your insides are a war zone. Not to mention your outsides!
47) 12) text: Wade looks stunned as he struggles to process all this information. Ajax smiles down.
47) 13) dialog: I've seen similar side-effects before.         I could cure them for you. But really, where's the fun in that?
47) 15) dialog: I'm going to close this lid again.     Maybe you no longer need it. But I do.
47) 16) text: For a long moment, Wade stares intensely at Ajax and sees nothing, a black hole of empathy. And he knows this is a who will never stop hurting him. ***NOTE: We will not be reshooting the rest of the scene below with the exception of the final shot.**** So he turns his gaze to the ceiling and WITHDRAWS into himself... the one place the cruelty can no longer reach Angel Dust enters, chewing on her usual matchstick.
47) 17) dialog: He's all yours.
47) 24) dialog: (impressed) Whoa.
47) 25) text: Angel advances toward Wade.      Ajax stops her.
47) 26) dialog: Hey, hey, alright. It's alright. I think he earned that one, yeah? You take off. Go on... off you go.
47) 27) text: As Angel Dust EXITS the tent, she reaches to her mouth fo her matchstick... only it's not there. She frowns, fishes another match from her pocket, and tucks it between her l Ajax finishes strapping Wade back down and goes to close lid.
47) 28) dialog: One question. What's my name?
47) 30) dialog: Didn't think so.
47) 31) text: Ajax CLOSES and LOCKS the lid.      HISS.    The oxygen D
47) 33) text: And then we're inside the punch bowl with Wade as the oxy levels drop and the suffering rises. Through a fog of mis Wade sees Ajax staring down, watching him, drinking in hi pain.
48) 7) dialog: You can't kill me, Wade. I'm the only one who can fix that ugly mug. Wade looks torn as his rage gives way to something like h He tosses the tank away.
48) 11) dialog: Say it.     `Francis.' Blood dribbles from Wade's mouth as he tries in vain to p himself off the bloody spike of metal. Ajax rises, scans burning workshop with a scowl - clearly a lost cause - an turns to leave. Cunningham screams again as the flames near him. Grunting with the pain and effort Wade tries to push himself off t spike.
52) 0) text: An FBI-STYLE `ORGANIZATIONAL CHART' has been pinned on Wa CORKBOARD in the lair. A `pyramid' of baddies are linked strings. Each baddie is depicted not by a photograph, but child-like CRAYON DRAWING. Second from the top is the RECRUITER. At the APEX of the pyramid is AJAX HIMSELF. DEADPOOL, in his LAIR, sews together an early `proto- costume.' We see quick cuts of pieces of it going on: White Adidas track suit. White gloves.            White b some sort of white mask... A single gun, underarm holster, boot knife but no swords.
63) 8) text: The action goes into Benny-Hill-like HYPER-SPEED as we re the opening scenes of the movie: DEADPOOL's CAB RIDE. AJA crumpling up his orange jumpsuit and switching places wit motorcycle RIDER at the RAFT. The FREEWAY FIGHT with AJAX GOONS. The CONFRONTATION with COLOSSUS. Until at last...
64) 0) text: Transport TRUCKS idle in the loading dock. A docile SUPER-SLAVE, fitted with a control collar and cu steps into a CRATE IDENTICAL to the ONES AJAX DELIVERED T THE WARLORD in ACT ONE. He lies down. ANGEL DUST is overseeing.      She plunges a pistol-grip into his neck and fires:
64) 2) text: The man's eyelids flutter shut. Next to him, four identic crates hold four unconscious men and women. The workshop henchmen hammer on the tops and laboriously load them up the truck. ANGEL picks up one over her shoulder with ease. She turns the sound of a sputtering motorcycle getting closer. Ajax rolls in on one of the battered black bikes from the freeway. Smoke curls from its broken tailpipe. He steps off the bike while it's still moving, just letti it roll forward and tip to the ground with a clank.
64) 3) dialog: Quit showing off, Angel.
65) 0) text: A WAREHOUSE full of SURGICAL EQUIPMENT. OVERHEAD LAMPS. FABRIC TENTS. CHROME TABLES, one of which Ajax sits on.
65) 1) dialog: Wade Fucking Wilson.
65) 6) dialog: I suppose if I looked like him, I'd wear a mask too. (Angel finishes final stitch) Only wish I mended the same.
65) 7) text: Ajax pops off the table.     Swings his arm around, testi shoulder.
65) 8) dialog: Not to worry. We'll put him out of our misery. On our terms.
65) 10) dialog: He can't - if there's nothing left of him to heal. And then we go back to business as usual.
65) 11) text: Ajax's hand is a blur as he plucks the MATCHSTICK from Angel's mouth.
65) 12) dialog: What say we leave the matches at home?
69) 14) text: No one answers.     Vanessa gets a bad feeling and starts back up. The man steps confidently into the light.        Not WADE ...but AJAX. Vanessa spins around and runs straight into Angel Dust, who step out of the shadows. Vanessa make a grab for her purse, contents spilling out the grimy street, but her hand comes up with a TASER. She jams it into the flesh of Angel Dusts shoulder. Angel Dust just smiles as electricity arcs and sizzles. she grabs Vanessa's hand and twists it away. Vanessa THRASHES like a polecat. But Angel Dust is brutal strong. She clamps her hand around Vanessa's jaw and SQUEEZES, dangling her in the air by her FACE.
69) 15) dialog: You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.
69) 17) dialog: `The good Lord sends the fishing...
69) 19) dialog: ...but you must dig the bait.'
70) 0) text: AJAX and Angel Dust stand at either side of a bound and gagged VANESSA. They are inside the metal cage of an INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR, going UP.
70) 2) text: A bare bulb casts harsh light as they rise past a dark ma of twisted metal. Ajax looks almost bored, hums to himsel tunelessly.
71) 0) text: AJAX explains his plan to VANESSA:
71) 1) dialog: That's what I thought, but he keeps on coming back. Like a Bad Jesus. But despite all Wade's powers, I still hold the advantage: He feels. Too strongly for his own good. Let's see how he fights with your head on the block.
78) 0) text: AJAX pulls VANESSA forward to the edge of the carrier dec forces her gaze downward toward the WAR ZONE below.
78) 1) dialog: How does it feel? Ex-boyfriend abandons you, becomes a sanity-challenged killer mutant in tights...
78) 3) dialog: `Til now. Ajax yanks Vanessa away from the edge again.
80) 17) text: From above, AJAX peers down sees that Deadpool has killed henchmen in such precise positions that their fallen bodi spell out: FRANCIS. Deadpool moves forward.       LIMPING.   CHARRED.   TATTE unbowed.
80) 18) dialog: That never gets old.    But neither will you.
80) 19) text: Right on cue... ...three more Mercs appear to either side of Ajax, armed HEAVY MACHINE GUNS - much NASTIER than any we've yet seen BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! The guards OPEN FIRE, and a BARRAGE bullets rain down on the scrapyard, chewing up the landsc around Deadpool.
81) 0) text: Four MERCS continue firing down as the wing soars up. The WING SMASHES into them.    All four go FLYING. DEAD under the wing. AJAX is thrown backward. One MERC lands, stunned, close to the edge.     A LONG BE AJAX rises to his feet. Then DEADPOOL pulls himself UP over the edge of the carri and ROLLS onto the deck. He looks like he's been through meat grinder - limping, scorched, bloody. Deadpool staggers to his feet.    The last injured MERC l tries to GRAB his ANKLE.
81) 7) dialog: (taps glass) What better way to climb back in your head...
81) 10) dialog: You two have a lot to work out. Take a deep breath. Wait. Wrong choice...
81) 11) text: Ajax quickly CLOSES the LID and hits a SWITCH.         Va starts taking short, desperate GASPS.
81) 12) dialog: ...of words.
81) 14) text: Ajax squats down and picks up TWO STEEL-HAFTED FIRE-FIGHT AXES, each with an ULTRA-SHARP BLADE on one side of its h and an EQUALLY SHARP CLAW on the other. Deadpool raises a KATANA and HURLS it NOT at Ajax, but th PUNCH-BOWL. The blade PENETRATES the PLEXI and tears into the RESTRAINT holding Vanessa's RIGHT WRIST, partly FRAYI it. AIR seeps through the CRACK. Vanessa catches a tiny BREATH. She TUGS on the frayed RESTRAINT.
81) 15) dialog: I hear you grow back parts. When I get done... parts will have to grow back you.
83) 0) text: And now, we get what we've been long been waiting for: THE FINAL CLOSE QUARTERS BATTLE between DEADPOOL AND AJAX AXES vs. KATANA, TEN STORIES UP... AJAX TAKES a MIGHTY, ROARING SWING with an AXE.

83) 11) text: AJAX snarls, drives a SHOULDER into Deadpool, then MOUNTS and BLUDGEONS his face with HAMMER-LIKE FISTS.

85) 0) text: DEADPOOL and AJAX are trading BLOWS again when the DECK S as if hit by a 9.0 EARTHQUAKE. Then with a thunderous, shuddering, groaning of metal the whole carrier begins to tilt. Loose wreckage begins to slide and tumble past. A shippin container barrels towards them and Deadpool kicks Ajax backwards, right into its path. SLAM! It plows into him a carries him with it as it disappears over the side. Deadpool scrambles and claws up the tilting floor and gra hold of Vanessa. Deadpool looks around frantically... ...and then spies the PUNCH-BOWL, sliding toward them. Deadpool grabs the side as it slides past and throws VANE inside and SHUTS the LID for protection... They slam into the twisted metal railings at the bottom o the deck and hang there. Deadpool swings by one hand and stares at the scrapyard below. Huge chunks of metal slide and smash past to tumble to the ground a hundred feet bel Vanessa hangs onto Deadpool for dear life, her eyes locke his...
86) 8) text: Deadpool is just staggering to his feet when AJAX emerges from under another BEAM and TACKLES him.

86) 18) dialog: Sorry. It's just. All this time, you bought that I have the cure? I'm flattered. But do I really look like the scientist type? You want the guy behind the guy. His name's Dr. Killebrew. And he's long gone. Who knows where.
