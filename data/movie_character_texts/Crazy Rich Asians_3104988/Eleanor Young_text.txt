3) 0) text: RAIN POURS on the children and Felicity as they watch Eleanor in a PHONE BOOTH. “THE CALTHORPE” sign casts a glow over them. We don’t know what she’s saying, but we hear Eleanor angrily speaking on the pone.
4) 0) text: Eleanor bursts through the front door with her family right behind her. Eleanor approaches the front desk again. Ormsby is not pleased.
4) 2) dialog: Please, go right ahead. Ormsby is taken aback. He moves to stop her when the elevator DINGS and OPENS and an ELDERLY MAN IN A SILK ROBE AND SLIPPERS comes out -- LORD CALTHORPE, the same man in the opening portrait and owner of the hotel. Ormsby snaps to.
4) 10) dialog: We'd be delighted. (turns to address Ormsby ) Do get a mop. The floor’s wet. Eleanor winks at Nick, who grins and looks back at Ormsby.
7) 53) dialog: ‘If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.’ It's been twenty years since we’ve seen Eleanor, but she looks amazing. She sits with FOUR FABULOUSLY DRESSED, BEJEWELED WOMEN: JACQUELINE LING (50s), ALIX YOUNG (50s), NADINE (30s), AND LORENA (40s). Uniformed MAIDS serve tea and “kuih,” local cakes.

8) 18) dialog: (to ladies) Move on to Corinthians, I’1l catch up.
8) 20) dialog: (back to phone; low) We're looking forward to having you home. And your room is all ready... for you. Nick hears this, gets the implication.
8) 22) dialog: I see. Well, I’m having the house redone. And it’s not ready for guests. If Rachel comes, I think she might be more comfortable staying somewhere else? Nick returns to the counter, to see the second sticky toffee pudding is gone, except for a TINY PIECE.
33) 0) text: The DISTANT JAZZ RIFF CONTINUES as we ENTER a bustling scene with MAIDS plating food, choppers chopping veggies madly, COOKS working over WOKS that BURST INTO FLAME, CHILDREN s neaking snacks.

Watch it, don’t make it too soft. Add chili... Ten minutes only. ] She's clearly used to running a great house and being obeyed. She pauses when she sees Nick enter. She’s delighted, but keeps her composure. Nick gives his mother a peck on the cheek.

33) 15) dialog: (to cooks; in Cantonese; subtitled) Wu hao luo ge ge, lingwai. [Don’t take that one. Another one. ] (back to Nick and Rachel) So, economics. Sounds challenging. (subtly fishing) Are your parents academics, as well?
33) 17) dialog: (in Cantonese; to cook; subtitled) Fang di yan qian xi ge du. [Put some cilantro there. ]
33) 22) dialog: Self-made woman. She must be so proud of you. Eleanor continues fiddling and fussing with the table, inspecting the food, coldly turning her back on the couple.
33) 24) dialog: Pursuing one’s passions. How American. Well, your mother is very open-minded, not like here, where parents are obsessed with shaping the life of their children. It sounds like a compliment, but Rachel isn’t entirely sure. Eleanor turns away again to talk to a passing COOK before returning to Rachel: Eleanor shoots Nick a look. He shifts, uncomfortable, and is relieved to hear a MUSICAL GONG from upstairs.
33) 26) dialog: Hmm. Go ahead. I’11 be out ina minute. Rachel, it was lovely meeting you.
35) 59) dialog: Ah Ma insists all your clothes be washed and pressed every two weeks. Nick sees his mother standing in the doorway. She walks over, takes the shirt from his hands and selects another shirt for him. (Throughout the scene she also quietly caters to Nick -- dusting his jacket, etc.)

35) 62) dialog: (glances over at him) Looking for your cigars? I had them thrown out years ago.
35) 64) dialog: I keep telling Ah Ma to put your things away, but she says this room makes her feel like you’re still here. (then) Well, I got an earful when you didn’t move back last year. Nick reacts, it’s a loaded subject. Eleanor helps Nick put on the clean shirt. (CONTINUED)
35) 67) dialog: Your father and I are really looking forward to having you home. He’s not getting any younger. With you onboard, maybe he'll take a day off once ina while.

35) 71) dialog: (noncommittal smile) Chinese-American. (fishes) You know, bringing her home, introducing her at a large family gathering... Some people may say --
35) 73) dialog: Is that an American accent I’m hearing?
35) 77) dialog: Perfect.
36) 32) dialog: When children are away from home too long, they forget who they are. FADE OUT.
58) 8) dialog: Better too many than have people say we're stingy. Meanwhile, Nick teaches Rachel how to fold a dumpling -- putting the mincemeat ball in the dough wrapper and sealing it closed.
58) 22) dialog: Ah Ma says if we don’t pass traditions down like this, they’1l disappear. (CONTINUED)
58) 39) dialog: (surprised; then) Nick’s father had it made when he proposed to me.
58) 43) dialog: I wasn’t. I withdrew from university when we got married.
58) 47) dialog: I chose to help my husband run a business and to raise a family. For me, it was a privilege. But for you, you may think it's old- fashioned. It's nice you appreciate this house and us being here together wrapping dumplings. But all this doesn't just happen. It's because we know to put family first, instead of chasing one's passion.

59) 0) text: Rachel exits the dining room, looking for anywhere to go. She walks up the long staircase, takes a few steps one way, realizes she’s going the wrong direction, then turns around to find Eleanor standing in front of her.
59) 3) dialog: I’m glad I found you. I’m afraid that I’ve been unfair.
59) 5) dialog: Not at all. (then) You asked about my ring. The truth is Nick’s father had it made when he wanted to propose to me, because Ah Ma wouldn’t give him the family ring. I wasn’t her first choice. Honestly, I wasn’t her second.
59) 7) dialog: I didn’t come from the right family, have the right connections. And Ah Ma thought I would not make an adequate wife to her son. surprised how Eleanor is seemingly opening up.
59) 9) dialog: It took many years, and she had good reason to be concerned. (off Rachel) Because I had no idea the work and the sacrifice it would take. There were many days when I wondered if I would ever measure up -- Eleanor pauses, looks at Rachel.
59) 10) dialog: But having been through it all, I know this much... (gets close; gently) You will never be enough. (CONTINUED)
59) 13) dialog: We should head back. I wouldn’t want Nick to worry.

Eleanor opens a DOSSIER on the table. Chinese news articles and police missing person reports featuring Kerry's picture.
75) 12) dialog: It’s all in here.
75) 14) dialog: We had every right.
75) 17) dialog: Do you have any idea the scandal this would have caused? For Rachel to hide something like this --

Eleanor walks up to the table. (CONTINUED)
81) 6) dialog: You asked me here. I assume it’s not for a mahjong lesson. Pung. She puts down a power card combo. The women toss red chips to her.
