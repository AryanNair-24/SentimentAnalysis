35) 23) dialog: Oh, go, go. Get changed. I/’11 keep Rachel company. Nick smiles to see him.
35) 30) dialog: Oh, I know. Peik Lin scampers up.
35) 35) dialog: (off Rachel) Uh, on the bright side, you’re the talk of the party. People like your dress. Peik Lin and Oliver take each other in. It’s instant fashion chemistry.
35) 37) dialog: Oh!
35) 39) dialog: Such a chic seventies goddess.
35) 41) dialog: It's very disco Cleopatra, but in a good way.
35) 43) dialog: Oh, well. Oliver. (CONTINUED)
35) 47) dialog: I like your shoes.
35) 49) dialog: Cheers.
35) 51) dialog: (re: her earrings) Gosh, these are lovely.
35) 53) dialog: Are they? Oh, wow!
35) 55) dialog: Mm, well, I’m one of the poorer relations. The rainbow sheep of the family. But I make myself useful. Whatever the Youngs want, I procure. Golden koi fish, Huanghuali furniture. A rare Cambodian gong.
35) 58) dialog: Because they can. 65. INT. TYERSALL PARK - NICK’S OLD ROOM - NIGHT Nick opens a closet, sees a row of meticulously pressed shirts hanging in a row. He smiles, takes one out. Eleanor walks in.
36) 5) dialog: Oh! Someone forgot to wear a bra. He gestures to Kitty Pong, who’s entered with Alistair.
36) 6) dialog: Kitty Pong. Cousin Alistair’s latest flame. An actress. Rumor is, she was in a porno. Two Girls, One Cup a Noodles. Kitty bends down to smell a tan hua, her boobs almost spilling out of her dress. The Aunties are horrified.
36) 11) dialog: The book is much better.
36) 14) dialog: Oh, they’re just jealous. You nabbed the crown prince. (off Rachel) Nicki is Ah Ma’s favorite, in line to inherit everything. No surprise there when that’s the competition. Oliver looks to Eddie checking himself out on his iPhone cam, and Alistair who’s hypnotized by Kitty’s cleavage. Rachel is uncomfortable with the implication.
36) 15) dialog: Oh, speaking of the grande dame... Rachel turns to see guests make way for an elderly lady, Nick’s AH MA (80s). She’s regal, elegant, but frail, leaning on Eleanor to help her walk. She doesn’t say a word, but everyone, her own family included, acts in total deference and respect to her. As Rachel takes it in, feeling a little out of place. Nick appears.
58) 16) dialog: I, on the other hand, was taught by Grand Aunty Mabel. ‘You put the Botox in the face and then you pinch, pinch, pinch, then voila!’
58) 29) dialog: Well, that’s because Aunty Felicity was doing after-school microdermabrasion.
58) 31) dialog: (brushing shirt) Aunty, this is Dolce.
58) 37) dialog: That's so lovely of you to say, Rachel. We all are very lucky to have each other. Alix and Felicity smile, approving. Feeling more comfortable, Rachel tries to engage Eleanor, who’s been largely silent. She sees Eleanor’s RING, a beautiful piece studded with diamonds and emeralds.
58) 60) dialog: Right, right. We're almost done here. Just a few more baskets. Ah Ma looks at the dumplings.
62) 2) dialog: All of it. And I would throw ina Korean snail face mask. Sweetie, your skin is so dry, it's hurting my face.
62) 4) dialog: You know, it’s about time someone stood up to Aunty Eleanor. Well, you, not me. Oh, God! She can’t know I was ever here.
62) 7) dialog: (yelling to the air) Right. Well, okay, let’s get to work. Cappuccinos. 102.
64) 1) dialog: Pull the plum Balenciaga, the peach Chloé, the Giambattista, all the Bottegas, oh, and that Jason Wu with the deconstructed ruffles.
64) 3) dialog: Oh!
64) 5) dialog: Right. I'm not sure if it's working or if she looks like a clown's tampon.
64) 8) dialog: (next dress) Y-You look like a flower. Like a sad, lonely flower no one wants to be around.
66) 1) dialog: Oh! Oh! It’s not that bad. It’s holding you up.
68) 2) dialog: Oh. Okay. This is why disco died.
68) 4) dialog: It's like a bag of Skittles. Taste the rainbow.
68) 5) dialog: Could work, if we... Yes. I, I think we just alter the -- Wye Mun comes back in offering another outfit --
70) 0) text: Oliver and Neenah are accessorizing the sparkly disco- type dress Rachel is now wearing.

Peik Lin’s parents get carried away and start making out on the chaise lounge. 105.
71) 0) text: Eddie trails off as the photographers suddenly head to -- -- a custom GOLD BENTLEY MULSANE. It’s driven by Peik Lin, who wears a fetching driver's uniform. Seeing the car, Oliver steps up as Peik Lin opens the door -- a shapely stilettoed leg steps out. It’s RACHEL in a glittering gown. Her hair is swept up, her jewelry catches the light, she’s a VISION. It’s an EXPLOSION OF FLASHES as photographers, reporters, and looky-loos take pictures, yell to get her attention. Rachel is a little overwhelmed, but Oliver helps navigate her through the crowd.
71) 4) dialog: (mouthing) You look wonderful. Breathe. (to paparazzi) Everyone, I've got Rachel Chu of New York. Rachel Chu of New York. Real estate heiress, Rachel Chu of the New York Chus.
73) 12) dialog: Lovely as always. You made it! All the Aunties turn to see Rachel, walking down the aisle. She’s confident, luminous, turning heads as she walks by. The Aunties look stunned as Rachel reaches their pew.
74) 13) dialog: (to Felicity) I mean, obviously...
74) 18) dialog: Yes, Aunty?
74) 20) dialog: As you wish. (CONTINUED)
74) 28) dialog: Alistair, your father’s looking for you. Something about an overdrawn discretionary account. Alistair’s face falls and he takes off. Oliver holds his hand out to Kitty, who takes it. As Oliver leads her in a dance, handling her expertly:
74) 31) dialog: So...
74) 33) dialog: How do you like the wedding? (CONTINUED)
74) 37) dialog: Hmm.
74) 39) dialog: (laughs) Sweetie! You’ll be lucky if Alistair’s parents give you a tea ceremony.
74) 41) dialog: You know, Alistair's only the fourth son of a penny-pinching family, don't you? I mean, he'll get next to nothing. You want a wedding like this? You should've fallen in love with an only child. Someone like... Bernard Tai. Oliver twirls her around and dips her to see Bernard surrounded by women and drinking from a champagne bottle.
76) 11) dialog: Oh, Nicki have you...?
76) 13) dialog: I don't -- (CONTINUED)
92) 0) text: Nick leads Rachel into the middle of a crowd of people with his hands covering her eyes. When he removes his hands, she sees a crowd of Nick’s friends screaming and cheering. Araminta and Colin in front leading the pack. It's an ENGAGEMENT PARTY at this mind-blowing location, perched high above the city. Everyone has shown up: Peik Lin, Eddie, Fiona, Alistair, Bernard, Kitty, Oliver, Colin, Araminta, Charlie, and THE GOHs. They all cheer and hug Rachel and Nick. Nick points for Rachel to look at the pool where SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMERS are performing. Rachel spots Eleanor in the distance. There’s a look of understanding, respect between them. Nick kisses Rachel as all the revelers clap and scream their congratulations. We PULL AWAY as fireworks explode in the b.g... FADE TO BLACK. 136.
