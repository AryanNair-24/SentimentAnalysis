The room falls silent. HITLER'S PERSONAL CHEF places a tray before the FГјhrer, producing a knife and fork, cutting a bite. We think he is going to hand feed Hitler until he places the food in his own mouth, chewing slowly, deliberately. He swallows. We wait for him to die. When he doesn't, Hitler begins to eat. The rest of the room relaxes slightly and digs in. ANGLE ON: Seated further down the table are Tresckow and his Aide. Between them, once again, is Brandt, eating like a pig, still making notes in his book. Tresckow stares.

Tresckow and his Aide are hunched over two bottles of Cointreau on a large desk next to: TWO PAIRS OF BRITISH `CLAMS' - a small black plastic casing held together by magnets and adhesive tape. Tresckow inserts a short, pencil-shaped fuse through the narrow opening. All that remains exposed is a small glass capsule. The trigger. Tresckow turns his attention to the bottles of Cointreau...

PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg, done up in his finest dress uniform, placing said medal on an unconscious WOUNDED SOLDIER. AN AIDE stands behind him, carrying a silver tray stacked with MANY BOXES containing such medals. PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg stands between two long rows of beds, each with A WOUNDED SOLDIER. Those that can respond to Stauffenberg do so with reverence. The ward is eerily silent. With only three fingers, Stauffenberg cannot pin the medals to his men. He has to settle for simply laying them on a each soldier's chest or a pillow. With each medal he presents, the task becomes harder to watch. Suddenly, Stauffenberg freezes, finding himself looking at THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT - his driver in Africa. The young man is a mass of bandages, his legs gone, his face smashed. CLOSE ON: Stauffenberg's face - the reality of Africa taking the wind out of him.
