4) 16) dialog: I'm sure Bumpy never told you, but he made me promise, anything ever happened to him, I'd make sure you didn't go without.
4) 18) dialog: That's the spirit. Go get them. On the TV, over archive film and photographs of crime figures from the 1940's and `50's, the opinion is offered that Bumpy's death "marks the end of an era ..."
76) 2) text: Joe bows graciously, gives a little wave to the crowd, an sits back down as the band starts up again. At another table, Frank sits with Charlie Williams and Rossi, slightly older dope men. Like Frank, they favor expensive tailored suits. Their dates, too, are nicely dressed - not too much make-up or jewelry. Frank's glance moves from Joe Louis and his wife to a beautiful young wo at the table.
76) 4) dialog: She is a beauty queen.    No kidding. Miss Puerto Rico.
100) 0) text: The penthouse is now richly decorated. The R &amp; B musi playing through a state-of-the-art stereo system.

118) 0) text: A TV: Muhammad Ali, the black man's black man, and Joe Frazier, the white man's black man, at their 1971 Madison Square Garden press conference where Ali says as much. Most of the guys watching it. Richie isn't. He comes over to Table of Organization. Tacks his Bar Association notice to it. Regards the photographs, like tentacles of octopus yet to have a head. Only the lowest section is made up of blacks (including Charlie Williams and Jackie Fox, but not Frank Lucas). Th rest of the faces are white and stop about midway up.

182) 9) dialog: Me, too.
