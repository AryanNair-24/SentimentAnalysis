Her face pressed to the port-hole window of the trailer’s Hauler room. A view of the gun racks, the PISTOL GRIP SHOTGUN, KALASHNIKOV, scoped Dakota. He slips into a clean shirt. A quick look around the room takes the Light Sabre down, hides it in the closet. Dana inspects the Renoir. Is this real? Her fingertips brush the canvas, down, his SIGNATURE.

78) 21) dialog: Maybe not. Anyway, I told myself spending a few hundred dollars on some satin bridesmaid knockoff I'd wear once and to an event I thought was silly in the first place--
78) 23) dialog: Aha! See? You get it. But Vera Wang on the other hand, she made a black strapless classic you could wear to all sorts of future events.

78) 36) dialog: I know what it means to obsess, Chris. To want something so entirely it becomes part of you.
78) 38) dialog: It wasn’t about the dress. I wanted to walk into that gym and have people say “wow.” I just, I just wanted to fit in. You know? Belong. Everybody does. Their eyes meet. He knows, understands.

78) 40) dialog: Paid for the limo. (beat) Wore the dress just the one time.
78) 42) dialog: Never had a reason. In college my idea of fun was quiz bowls, art museums, speed math. Not sororities and such.

78) 57) dialog: I’m not following you.
78) 59) dialog: Why? Why would he take it out just to put it back?
78) 63) dialog: Public perception.
