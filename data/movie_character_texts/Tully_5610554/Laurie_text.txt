4) 3) dialog: Hi Marlo. Are you on maternity leave yet? You look like you're about to pop.
4) 6) dialog: I’ll try not to take up too much of your time here, so I’ll just get right to it: Ms. Marvish tells me that Jonah is still having a tough time in class. We’re concerned about his social and emotional development.
4) 8) dialog: It’s April.
4) 10) dialog: And there’s about to be a big disruption in Jonah’s life, too.
4) 12) text: Jonah’s sweetheart. We love him. But as you know, he’s an “out-of- the-box” kid. He’s quirky. Marlo nods, subtly lip-syncing the word “quirky” as Lauri says it. It’s a euphemism that comes up a lot regarding Jonah. LAURIE (CONT’D) There are twenty-four other children in the class, and it’s not fair to them when Jonah needs so much of the teacher’s time. Marlo’s response is eager, desperate.
4) 14) dialog: (interrupting) We think Jonah could benefit from a one-to-one aide. A teacher just for him, who shadows him during the day and gives him the extra support he requires.
4) 16) dialog: No, we don’t provide aides.
4) 18) dialog: Yes, you’d need to hire this person.
4) 20) dialog: (confused) One aide. He just needs one. Marlo nods seriously, giving up on the AIDS joke.
4) 22) dialog: We don’t usually make these kinds of accommodations for students at Saint V.’s, but you guys are a great family, so...
4) 24) dialog: No problem. Have a great day now. Marlo musters a smile and rises to exit, shattered.
17) 4) dialog: Hi. Thank you so much for coming in today. I know mornings aren’t easy. Especially for you right now.
17) 6) dialog: So, we’re coming up on the end of the kindergarten year, and I just wanted to talk to you about Mister Jonah! Her quasi-affectionate use of “Mister” doesn’t mask the tension.
17) 8) dialog: Right. I know. (then) Back when you guys applied, we did express some concerns about whether or not Saint Vitus was the right fit for Jonah. But we love your family, and we have such a great relationship with your brother and his wife... 29.
17) 10) dialog: That’s not--
17) 12) dialog: We think Jonah might be better served by a different school.
17) 14) dialog: No, Marlo... Expulsion is a punishment. We would call this a dismissal.
17) 16) dialog: There are places better suited to kids like Jonah.
17) 18) dialog: Well, you know, Jonah is quirky.
17) 22) dialog: No, no, no. Jonah is bright. He’s great. It’s just not the right fit.
17) 24) dialog: (shaken) Dallas, please walk her out.
17) 27) dialog: You need to calm down. I’m not letting you leave like this.
29) 13) dialog: I’m very pleased to hear that.
29) 15) dialog: You'll find the right fit for him.
29) 16) text: Public school. Free of charge, free of Jesus! She grins triumphantly. Laurie is not sure what to make o Marlo’s manic humor, but she smiles back.
29) 18) dialog: You too! Marlo exits cheerfully.
