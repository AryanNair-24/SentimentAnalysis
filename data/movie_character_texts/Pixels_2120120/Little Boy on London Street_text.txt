He stares, in shock, at flying centipede. It’s HEADING RIGHT DOWN TOWARDS HIM. Time slows down. Brenner, pissed off, appears at the wind and TAKES AIM. THE CENTIPEDE OPENS ITS MOUTH. ONLY A FEW FROM THE BOY. In SLO MO BRENNER FIRES! BLAST BLAST BLAST! The tail end hit and disappears again and again, the Centipede getting shorter and shorter til it’s just the head, opening it’s mouth to eat the boy... THE LAST BLAST HITS IT. The centi DE-RESES AND PIXELATES INTO NOTHING. The Little Boy smiles at him.
