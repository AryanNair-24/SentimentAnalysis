22) 9) dialog: Well then let’s blow Galaga to hell. Who’s Galaga?
24) 2) dialog: Except North Korea!
24) 4) dialog: So we should blow up Google!
24) 6) dialog: Who is this person?!

If it got out to the press that we were pinning the blame on an old contuter game, they wouldn’t just * mock you on the news, Mr. President: they’d impeach you! So I * suggest the man in the orange shorts leave the room immediately, so those of us with long pants and government positions can discuss our options! All eyes turn to the President.

79) 52) dialog: But nothing! You heard Hall and Oates: you blew it! I’ve seen your file: you’ve never accomplished a damn thing in your life! And your streak continues!
