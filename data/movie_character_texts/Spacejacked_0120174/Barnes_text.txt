0) 49) dialog: Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich. Reynolds takes a look at his watch - 
0) 52) dialog: Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go  run a check on that room, just  to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
0) 54) dialog: Yeah.  I think he's developing a crush on me. Taylor smiles as Barnes exits - he then turns his attenti POV he cursors down to a command - "LIFE POD STATUS: ENGA We see him select that option - 
0) 97) dialog: Yeah go.
0) 101) dialog: No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
0) 105) dialog: There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
0) 108) dialog: Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
0) 110) dialog: Trust me. (Beat)
0) 191) dialog: Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -  Taylor leans back in his chair, yawns, and stretches - 
0) 193) dialog: I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
0) 195) dialog: Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
0) 197) dialog: It's steady, good benefits. Barnes looks at Taylor - 
0) 198) dialog: You gotta think of your old age.
0) 200) dialog: Thank you. Taylor gets up - 
0) 202) dialog: Nah, I already ate. (Beat)
0) 205) dialog: Uh... Barnes gestures to the consoles - 
0) 206) dialog: I think I can handle it.
0) 209) dialog: No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.

0) 228) dialog: Well...I suppose you can't have your cake... A screen then appears before Barnes - it reads:

0) 234) dialog: It's a little late for you to  be up.
0) 238) dialog: That's mine.  I was just having  a little fun. Reynolds turns and looks incredulously at Barnes -

Barnes then aims at Reynolds' head offscreen - BLAM!  Blo wall - CLOSE on Barnes face as he looks in the direction of the CLOSE on the computer: 5...4...3...2...1... CLOSE on Barnes -

0) 267) dialog: Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here. Barnes looks at the diagram and smiles faintly - 
0) 268) dialog: A little sloppy.  But it will do.
0) 271) dialog: That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor. Taylor looks around the room - 
0) 273) dialog: We hope you're enjoying your trip.   And we apologize to those currently hurtling through space.  Guess them's the breaks.
0) 276) dialog: Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
0) 279) dialog: The bridge is fine, Taylor, how  are things down there?
0) 281) dialog: Much as I'd like to help you and  our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
0) 283) dialog: Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency!   (Beat)
0) 288) dialog: It's a weave, Taylor, and you  know that.  We've always been  straight with one another.
0) 290) dialog: Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
0) 292) dialog: Ok, I will.  The bad news is the  ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
0) 295) dialog: I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor.  You  needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone,  jettisoned. Save for one.
0) 297) dialog: And I think we know who's getting it.
0) 299) dialog: I was getting to that.  Now please don't try my patience Ryan.
0) 301) dialog: Now we're all businessmen and a common rule of business is to make payment for services rendered. Given that, I'm willing to provide a service to each and every one of you.
0) 303) dialog: I'm willing to transmit that code 3 emergency. If you're lucky a rescue team might just get to you in time. Of course by then I'll be long gone.
0) 306) dialog: Well Carlo, you're not really part of the equation...
0) 308) dialog: But those other high rollers around you are.  I will provide this service in return for the personal  authorization codes of each and every  bank account.  Once I have those codes, and I've completed the  transfer, I'll signal the alarm.  But not a minute before.
0) 311) dialog: What part didn't you understand, fat  man?  It's a hold up, pure and simple.   I want your money.  Cooperate and I'll let you live.  And this offer is non- negotiable.  Dawn walks over to Taylor - 
0) 315) text: It's suicide Barnes!  How do you think you're going to get away it!
0) 317) dialog: I understand your concern, but those are my problems, not yours. But for the record, the transfer  trail will take them years to follow.   By then it won't matter, because I  won't exist, at least not on paper.        
0) 319) dialog: Well, I guess that's just a  question of faith, huh?  Of course, if money means more to you than a chance at survival... I'd say you're my kind of guy!
0) 321) dialog: Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
0) 323) dialog: Now I think I've given you all the information you need to make  a sound decision.  But I'd advise you to hurry. Barnes leans closer to the microphone - 
0) 324) dialog: I'll give you fifteen minutes to organize your information.  I'll take any further delay as a sign you've rejected the offer, and then of course, it's rescinded. Barnes then reaches over to a button - 
0) 325) dialog: Over and out. Barnes then presses the button - 
0) 382) dialog: That's me.
0) 384) dialog: Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
0) 386) dialog: Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
0) 388) dialog: I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
0) 390) dialog: Oh you'll get it, believe me. (Beat)
0) 393) dialog: Yeah yeah, 10-4... Barnes disconnects the message -  He then gets up and approaches Reynolds, lying dead on th him for a beat -  He reaches into the bloody robe pocket and pulls out a

0) 405) dialog: Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
0) 407) dialog: Well, preferably in tens and  twenties...
0) 409) dialog: That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
0) 411) dialog: Once I'm done verifying them. Can't be too trustworthy nowadays. Taylor slowly holds up the piece of paper to the lens -

Suddenly there is a bell indicating someone trying to ent Barnes swings around -  He checks the monitor and sees it is Mac, waiting outside Barnes grabs up his gun and approaches the door -  He opens the door, all the time aiming his weapon -  Mac stares at him - 
0) 501) dialog: Where the hell did you come  from?
0) 505) dialog: Sure.  Come on in pally.  Take a load off. Mac enters the room - 
0) 513) dialog: So how did you get here, Mac? I'm impressed.
0) 515) dialog: Weren't you down in the dining room?
0) 517) dialog: Oh he did, did he? The smile fades from Barnes' face - 
0) 519) dialog: You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
0) 521) dialog: And what are they doing now, Mac?
0) 523) dialog: Were you going to give it to them?
0) 525) dialog: Well you did the right thing Mac. Barnes gets up - he sees the wrist walkie on Mac -  
0) 526) dialog: So, you were communicating with officer Taylor over the wrist walkie? Barnes inspects the walkie, notices it is on channel 10 - he laughs and shakes his head - 
0) 527) dialog: On channel 10?
0) 529) dialog: Well, we're going to have to  do something about that aren't we?
0) 532) dialog: Taylor, you surprise me. Taylor looks up in disbelief - 
0) 534) dialog: Never send an android to do a man's work.
0) 537) dialog: Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses. (laughs)
0) 541) dialog: I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
0) 543) dialog: I suppose you want a diatribe about  my agenda to get even with the  world, or some crap.  
0) 545) dialog: Well it's not that complex.  I  don't give a damn about the haves, and I don't give a damn about the have- nots.  And I sure as hell don't give a damn about any of you.
0) 547) dialog: It's business.  Period.  If you followed directions, you might have  had a chance.  But all that's all  over now. Barnes then heads over to the console and adjusts some eq
0) 548) dialog: I'll tell you what I will do,  though.  I'll make sure you all see  the moon.  Unfortunately it will have to be a one way trip.
0) 550) dialog: So in closing I'd like to thank all of you for your generous contributions and thanks for flying the Star  Princess.  Watch your step on the way  out.  Bye bye. Taylor lowers his walkie - the others respond with sunken
0) 552) dialog: Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
0) 554) dialog: Yes, your wings. Mac reels for a beat, then continues - 
0) 556) dialog: I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
0) 558) dialog: And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac... Barnes puts his arm around Mac - 
0) 559) dialog: You're really gonna go far in this business.
0) 669) dialog: Those idiots... Barnes then presses another button -  POV the monitor shows a WIDE VIEW of the hallway outside Barnes scrutinizes the image -  he sees something he does like - he hits a button -  POV the monitor ZOOMS IN to reveal the doors to the dinin inches -  Barnes frowns at this discovery - 
0) 677) dialog: I know, I know. Barnes keeps checking the security monitor - he is now ex the ship - 
0) 679) dialog: Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
0) 681) dialog: Damn it!
0) 684) dialog: Don't do anything until further notice! Barnes then rushes over to a console - 
0) 747) dialog: The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson! Barnes looks out the window - 
0) 748) dialog: This ship is going down in a  blaze of glory!
0) 750) dialog: Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now. (Beat)
0) 779) dialog: (far away, muffled)
0) 783) dialog: I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
0) 785) dialog: Let's get something straight,  Chappy!
0) 787) dialog: I don't take orders from you, you take orders from me! You got that? Struggling not to make a sound, Taylor bites his lip and
0) 790) dialog: Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
0) 792) dialog: Well then why don't I tell you something, good buddy?  I don't need to listen to shit from you! Now you want to call it off fine, I'll take the risk of re-entry but you're out of the picture, understand? The pilot says nothing - 
0) 794) dialog: Now we'll regroup in 24 hours, tell whoever you need to you're extending the trip, and pick me up accordingly. Is that clear? The pilot says nothing - 
0) 795) dialog: Is that clear?
0) 797) dialog: Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
0) 799) dialog: Over and out! Barnes disconnects the transmission -
