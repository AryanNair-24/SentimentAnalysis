10) 6) dialog: But, the real reason I’m here in this early stage is because our research shows that your particular plot of land has a potentially “high yield”. That means that not only the size of the deposit, but the quality of the shale is in the top tier. Drew, as if watching a thriller movie.
10) 8) dialog: Now we at Global don’t want to be tenants... We want to be partners. That’s why we offer an 12 anda half percent share in any and all profits we see from your wells. 15 19

11) 11) dialog: It is! Very exciting!
11) 13) dialog: That’s also true, yes!
11) 15) dialog: Well, our research department hasn't finished their analysis yet but I’d say somewhere between 15 or 20 million dollars!
11) 17) dialog: Could be! Lynn returns with a cup of coffee and a creamers.
11) 19) dialog: I understand your concern. I’ve read all those stories myself. And let me assure you--
11) 21) dialog: These are just scare tactics--
11) 23) dialog: Mr. Richards--
11) 27) dialog: Look, there are answers to everything you just brought up--
11) 30) dialog: It’s 30,000.
11) 32) dialog: We can offer you 30,000 dollars. The waitress comes back to the table.
11) 37) dialog: Mr. Richards, I’m just being straight with you here. It’s simple math. Best case scenario there’s 30 million dollars under your town. .1% of that is 30,000 dollars. They want me to offer as low as 10 in these situations. But, you seem like a smart guy so I’m telling you we have 30. Richards reaches for his jacket. Steve sips coffee.
11) 38) dialog: «+. But, I’m also telling you this is a one time offer. Richard stops and looks at Steve.
11) 39) dialog: Don’t do this. I’ve been here before and it doesn’t end well. You don’t wanna be last. You're right, we have teams in place in towns all over this state... and the next state. And the next state. We’re all the way up to Maine now. And every one of those towns are signing fast. Richards smiles, saying nothing.
11) 40) dialog: Look, I don’t fault you for trying. But, I’m telling you-- hell, I’m begging you. Don’t do this. Because the truth is we will walk away. We always do... (MORE )
11) 42) dialog: And then after every single town within 3 states has signed up and the blows of this economy are almost unbearable... we’1ll come back. And we'll offer you nothing. We'll offer this town nothing. Every lease we’ve signed, every piece of the pie we've offered. It all goes away... and we buy this place for nothing. Richards’ face has changed.
11) 43) dialog: Let some other guy be last. The waitress comes back to the table with the check. He hands her a 20 dollar bill.
11) 44) dialog: Thank you. Steve stands up.
11) 45) dialog: So, I'll see you tomorrow?

16) 60) dialog: I only heard the last part of what you were saying, but you sound like aman that’s certainly done his homework! Where, may I ask did you get all your information?
16) 62) dialog: You're probably right. And I’m sure I’m not the guy who has all the answers.
16) 64) dialog: Listen, I’m not going to deny that this issue has been made very complicated by a number of companies that have had their fair share of incidents. (MORE)
16) 66) dialog: But, natural gas is not a new issue. We've been drilling in this country for over 50 years. And like any industry, you evolve. My company alone has invested millions and millions of dollars. Now why would we do that? If we’re this ‘evil machine’ that cares about nothing but the bottom line, why would we invest in something that is fatally flawed? Because instead of being one of the companies that is working to make the process “faster”, we chose to make it “right”!... For this exact moment. Because we knew if we figured out how to do it right... we'd be the only ones on the field. Frank smiles. Beat.
16) 68) dialog: Sure we are. Like any other company our size in every other industry. And we stand up to those people because we’re not in the business of handing out free money to people who make false claims. And we haven’t lost once.
16) 71) dialog: Perfect? (smiles) No, maybe not.. But with all the government restrictions they put on us and hoops we have to jump through, it’s pretty close to perfect. (MORE)
16) 73) dialog: Heck, the only reason why natural gas is so big right now is because it’s finally the clean alternative TO the incredibly dangerous industries like coal and oil. If you know of another industry that’s cleaner than this and can have this big an impact on our country right now, please tell me, cause I'll go work there. Crowd smiles. Beat. If
16) 76) dialog: I can certainly try.
16) 78) dialog: ... And I’m happy to answer all those questions. There’s no such thing as a neutral position here. If you're against natural gas, you’re FOR coal and oil. Unless we talk about cutting our consumption. (MORE)
16) 80) dialog: And so far that’s a conversation none of us are willing to have. Frank smiles. There’s a long pause.
16) 82) dialog: Well, you've certainly done that.
16) 84) dialog: Wait, what?
16) 86) dialog: But that’s not-- He turns to Richards, confident this isn’t possible.
16) 89) dialog: Mr. Yates, with all do respect, I’ve talked to a lot of folks here who really need this. And I don’t think anyone here is going to be swayed by one man. 44

49) 24) dialog: Don’t want to apply for college loans for your kids? This money says “Fuck you”, loans. You worried about car payments? “Fuck you”, payments. The bank’s gonna forclose on your family farm? “Fuck you”, bank. “Fuck you” money is the ultimate liberator. And underneath this town is “fuck you” money. You think long and hard about all those brutal days workin’. And the bullshit checks you get from whatever goddamn frozen peas company that’s buying. You think about how much you made on your best day... and then you think real hard about how much you made on your worst. Cuz let’s be real honest with each other, they’re all starting to look like that more and more aren’t they? These people? This town? This life? It’s dying and damn near dead. And you all see it coming! And you just won't get the hell out of the way. Why??? Pride? Of WHAT??? What have you got? And for fuck’s sake, how much of it is even yours???

You'll remember this conversation and remember the guy who looked you right in the eye and said “Fuck you”. In a flash the biggest, quietest farmer walks forward and punches Steve in the face, immediately dropping him to th ground. We see it’s the LARGE MAN that shut the door on Steve earlier. The farmers stand over him and we can see they’re furious... but they also listened. It’s intense.

For the first time we see what Steve has been staring at before the Farmers cam over to him... Behind the bar, under all the bottles he notices a series Polaroid pictures lined up. Above the pictures is written big glittery letters “ABSOLUT MADNESS”. At the end of the row of pictures... is Steve. For the first time we get a glimpse into the horror that was Steve’s first night in t In the picture, Steve is ruddy faced and sweating... he almost doesn’t look human. He’s in mid-scream and holds u his hands in metal-fan fashion, fingers posed in the shap horns. He looks ridiculous... but in his head... he looks awesome. Underneath each picture is the name of a state o city. Under Steve’s it says ‘IOWA’ INT. MOTEL - STEVE’S ROOM - NIGHT 71A Steve sits on the bed staring off.

58) 3) dialog: I was looking at this picture for a while last night. A long while... But, I found myself staring at this barn. The wood on the side is buckling. Probably from all the salt water in the air. The paint’s chipping and the flag is fading. It reminded me of my grandfather's barn... That barn was the bane of my existence... it was immaculate. It seemed like every other summer we were out painting that thing. Hours and hours... in all that heat. And I remember asking him why. Why do we have to do this? And he'd just look at me and say “It’s our barn. Who else is going to do it?”
