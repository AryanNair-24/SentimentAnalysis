The older man says something unintelligible to the Bearde Man in Dutch and hands over the printout of the various books. The Bearded man looks at the list for a while. The older man makes to get out of the booth forcing Warren to stand up to let him out - it’s unclear if he is leaving o going to the bathroom.
108) 14) dialog: No, no he is my employer. (beat) Well, actually we are kind of related. He is married to my mother’s sister - kind of an uncle.
