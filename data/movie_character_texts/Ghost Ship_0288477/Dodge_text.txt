Dodge (37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy  coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate  Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat first mate, African American, originally from some swelte red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to north. They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable  occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the ster where the cable winds into a tow anchor.

Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a b and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodg name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick sta of hundreds.

42) 9) dialog: If you get it back in one piece.

81) 16) dialog: I gotta pull the blades and re-seat  everything in a new rotor -- .
81) 18) dialog: Three, four days.
81) 20) dialog: What do you want me to tell you,  that we can throw this sucker back  in and start pulling her like nothing  happened? Can't do it, skipper. A beat as Murphy stands there, knowing he's right.
82) 14) dialog: Man, it gives me the creeps. We got  no business towing a ship that size  anyway. I say we fix the turbines  and hit the highway.
82) 16) dialog: Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have  been lost at sea fifty years ago.  You don't think that's just a little  freaky?

The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment. Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face an hands singed. An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl throug the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.

The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, tur his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet aga as clouds of halon rise up. Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Do fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to t wall again. Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to th deck, and finally out.

117) 14) dialog: I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a  professional salvage crew going about  our business. What's some yahoo doing  way out here by himself anyway?
117) 16) dialog: Why not? Why the fuck not? A beat as Murphy, Greer and Epps exchange looks.
117) 17) dialog: Fifty million dollars. Fifty million.  We gonna let this guy just take it  from us? One guy?
117) 19) dialog: I'm saying we gotta do whatever we  gotta do to preserve our interest.

His arms are flexed and twisted so that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists  quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other. Murphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, fa contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering  nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in tongues.

141) 15) dialog: Yeah, well. The truth is one thing.   When there's more than a few hundred  million dollars involved, that's a  whole new deal.
141) 17) dialog: For starters, getting that gold off  the ship. What they don't know about  isn't gonna bother them. A beat as Murphy holds there.
