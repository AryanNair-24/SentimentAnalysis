As the crew of the Dei  Gratia got closer, they discovered  that no one was at the helm of the  Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found  her completely deserted. The captain,  his wife, their daughter, and the  entire crew, all gone. The last entry  in their log made no mention of any  trouble. The table was even set for  dinner. And in the nine days after  the last entry, she sailed 700 miles  without anyone aboard.

96) 9) dialog: It looks like it. A beat as they let this sink in.
96) 11) dialog: We leave it where it is. Stick to  the plan.
96) 13) dialog: So we get a little more for the boat.  Besides, the gold'll be safer where  it is.
96) 15) dialog: It's worth the effort. Believe me.   Besides we're gonna need her to prove  the salvage.
96) 17) dialog: For now the best thing we can do is  to keep quiet about this.
96) 21) dialog: Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
