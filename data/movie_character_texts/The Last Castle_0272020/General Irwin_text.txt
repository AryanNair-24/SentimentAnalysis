18) 1) dialog: (to Peretz) Of course my old man was a complete fraud. After he died I found his collection in the attic -- Kraut helmet, Luger, Nazi flag. (re: item in case) Look at that. From Appomatox. Irwin looks at Peretz -- may I? Peretz nods -- go ahead. Irwin slides back the glass and picks up an old bayonet. He’s turning it over in his hands when the door opens and Winter comes back in.

29) 12) dialog: In the wall. Have you found the weakness in the wall? My guess would be the mortar. May 1? Irwin picks up Beaupre's pick, taps the tip of the pick against the mortar on the bottom row of stones. It crumbl He hacks at it and the mortar comes away in great chunks. GENERAL IRWIN (cont'd) Mr. Aguilar, would you mind? Irwin offers Aguilar the pick. Aguilar hesitates, looks a Beaupre. GENERAL IRWIN (cont'd) (to Beaupre) Let's look at the other side.

32) 29) dialog: That's right you can’t compare. This is summer camp. And you're... you're whining. Irwin shakes his head, rises, starts out.
32) 37) dialog: Three years ago, in Bosnia, I was driving through an IFOR town, and I saw an old man sitting on the steps of his house with a child I presume was his grandson, playing dominces, and I had a revelation. All my life in the Army, through good wars and bad, I'd been doing my best to make dangerous parts of the world safe enough so old men could sit on their steps and play games with their grandchildren. It was not entirely selfless, of course. I loved the work with all my heart. I gave a great deal for it. I lost a wife due to neglect. J am a stranger to my daughter. I have a grandson I have never met. (beat) When I saw that old man in Bosnia, I didn’t begrudge him his game with his grandson. I simply thought, “My turn.” Now, I didn’t retire after Bosnia. I should have, but I didn’t. I took one last assignment. To Burundi. And here I am. (beat) I'm done, gentlemen. I’m not fighting anyone or anything ever again. I’m going to do my time, then I’m going to go home, and, God willing, sit on my front steps and play a game of dominoes with my grandson. And with that, Irwin walks out. Enriquez is pissed, Doc i disheartened. Cyrus just watches Irwin go.
34) 4) dialog: Don't do that. Irwin keeps walking. Aguilar keeps saluting. GENERAL IRWIN (cont'd) Go-- Just-- At ease. Aguilar drops his arm, slumps. Irwin keeps going, then st looks back. He sees the sadness in Aguilar’s eyes. GENERAL IRWIN (cont'd) What branch were you in, Aguilar?
34) 6) dialog: Miss it?
34) 8) dialog: Why are you here? What did you do?
34) 10) dialog: Oh. Irwin starts off.
34) 12) dialog: How long have you been in here?
34) 15) dialog: o~ How much longer do you have?
34) 17) dialog: Take your time. We're in prison. We've got nothing but time. Aguilar nods, breathes, tries it slowly.
34) 19) dialog: How's it been?
34) 21) dialog: o~ So, tell me, along with the stutter, do you have some kind of spinal . deformity? A curvature, some misaligned vertebrae...?
34) 23) dialog: Then why are you standing like that? I said “at ease," not slouch. Aguilar straightens up. GENERAL IRWIN (cont'd) And what was that thing you did with your hand?
34) 25) dialog: It looked like you were running your fingers through your hair and they got stuck. (CONTINUED)
34) 29) dialog: It was? A salute? Really.
34) 31) dialog: Do you know why we salute?
34) 33) dialog: Okay, but why a salute? Why this thing with the hand? That stumps Aguilar. GENERAL IRWIN (cont'd) The truth is, the hand is almost immaterial. A salute is basically a frozen wave. (demonstrates) It's as if you’re waving at someone and you stop, you hold it. That's the sign of respect. Not the fact you have your hand up, but that you’re not moving. You’re staying still for that person, giving them your attention. (beat) A proper salute starts at your feet. As Irwin starts instructing Aguilar how to salute, we PAN and BOOM UP to see...

Peretz stands over him, face blank, as the other guards run up.

49) 34) dialog: When you are tortured, the first thing they try to do is break down your sense of self. I broke quickly. Within weeks, self- preservation was the last thing on my mind. In fact, I Prayed for death. Every night. The only thing that kept me from answering those prayers myself was the thought of the men in the other rooms. They kept me alive, Mr. Yates, not the other way around. The_horn sounds. Karen Goldberg 70 71 72 55.

59) 6) dialog: I think I want the same thing you do -- that they should be better men going out of here than they were coming ain,
59) 11) dialog: I labor under no illusions about what these men have done. I just think they could occasionally be reminded of the best thing they did in'their lives rather than having to only think of the worst. Winter looks at Irwin. He walks over to his display cases looks over his collection.

71) 1) dialog: Some might think to be remembered in this way would be a disgrace to a soldier, but there is no disgrace in this. The greatest monuments to our fallen heroes are not made of marble. They're deep in the jungle -- a rifle driven into the ground, a helmet perched atop it, some dog tags. (beat) And that is the kind of tribute this man has earned. He doesn't get a twenty-one gun salute or any of the other honors usually bestowed upon a soldier. He gets more. (beat) He goes to meet his maker with the honor he claimed for himself. (beat) Gentlemen -- Private First Class Ramon Aguilar, United States Marine Corps. Irwin bows his head and places his hand over his heart. THE THREE HUNDRED MEN follow suit. Someone in the group starts singing the Marine hymn. A few others join in. Karen Goldberg 66.

75) 11) dialog: They don't want better food. They don't want more TV. They don't even want out. They just want you to go away. Winter looks at Irwin for a moment, thinking.
75) 13) dialog: I agree with them. You should go. But not because of the brutality you encourage. Not even because you have men killed. You should go because you are the very worst kind of officer. You’re a disgrace to the uniform. (CONTINUED)
77) 3) dialog: Frankly, Lieutenant, I'm feeling a little confused. I’m trying to figure out what possible reason my lawyer could have for being here.
79) 5) dialog: What are you talking about, Yates?
81) 4) dialog: Colonel, may I ask one question before I go?
81) 6) dialog: What I’d like to know is-- Irwin suddenly hauls off and clocks Winter with a roundho right. Winter sails back, hits the ground, blood streamin from his nose. GENERAL IRWIN (cont‘d) (cont'd) --did you really think you could get rid of me that easily? Peretz and McLaren are on Irwin in a flash, wailing with their batons. Irwin covers up and drops.

108) 8) dialog: The first castles were the walled cities of Mesopotamia built over 8,000 years ago. Castles haven’t changed much down the centuries. There have always been walls and gates and men to guard them. Castle walls have always held high ground positions to fire from and places to run a flag. The only difference between this castle and the countless others built over the last 8,000 years is that they were built to keep people out. This castle was built to keep people in. But it’s still a castle. And the secret to taking it is gaining control of the one thing battle-planners have always wanted to control. (CONTINUED)
