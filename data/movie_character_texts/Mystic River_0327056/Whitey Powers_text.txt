6) 2) dialog: Guy won't stop confessing. We should pull a lawyer out of one of these B.M.W.s. Sean keeps staring down over the rail.
6) 3) dialog: What'cha looking at?
6) 9) dialog: The wife left you, what, six months ago.
6) 11) dialog: So, Jenny Coughlin there, Jenny with the bod', the voice, the cuffs, the girl makes gay guys reconsider their orientation.
6) 13) dialog: She is trying to bed you and you don't even blink.
6) 15) dialog: You haven't even talked to Lauren in six months.
6) 17) dialog: And doesn't speak. Weirdest fucking thing I ever heard. Sean looks back out at the neighborhood.
6) 19) dialog: Maybe she's waiting for you to say something. INT. McGILL'S BAR -- JUKEBOX -- NIGHT Where DIANE CESTRA drops a quarter in the slot. Pressing D-3, she looks back and smiles at her friends, EVE PIGEON and Katie Marcus. It's "Brown Eyed Girl" as VAN MORRISON starts: "Hey where did we go...?"
16) 0) text: Blue sawhorses stamped °BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT® cordon off the scene. The crime scene services van is parked further down. Sean Devine pulls up in an unmarked, gets out. He's met by his partner Whitey.
16) 1) dialog: Hey, bad boy. This should be the city's but... (points) Park's reservation land. State jurisdiction, not city. If the body's in there, it's our case. Police are already walking through the underbrush.
16) 4) dialog: She tell him? They all laugh, but Sean. It's too goddamn early. 21.
16) 8) dialog: You know her?
16) 12) dialog: Is it a problem? You close with the guy? Sean waves it off. He's staying on the case.
16) 14) dialog: Nineteen... Fuck, man. He's in for a world of hurt.
20) 0) text: A nylon triangle hangs from a branch. Just under a footbridge over Pen Channel. The CSS Tech pinches it off with a pair of tweezers. It's got blood on it. Sean and Whitey crouch by the arch. There's a woman's shoe there along with several similar footprints. 24.
20) 1) dialog: I'd say she might've hid here a bit. Killer shows and she bolts to the other side, takes off running again. Sean looks out to where the water in the channel widens out.
23) 0) text: Sean looking for something, anything. Whitey steps over. 26.
23) 1) dialog: We got dogs sniffing something by the old drive-in screen. Want to take a walk over? Sean nods. His WALKIE-TALKIE SURGES TO LIFE.
26) 0) text: Steps lead down to a door on the side of the screen. CSS flashbulbs pop. Whitey looks in, jots notes. An assistant MEDICAL EXAMINER is down on his knees looking at something. Plus a platoon of uniformed troopers and Boston PD blues. A BABY-FACED COP stares away from the action, being comforted by his partner as Sean passes on his way in.
26) 2) dialog: That her? As gently as he can, Sean uses his forefinger to move back a heavy strand of hair. He looks at Katie a moment.
26) 4) dialog: We'll have the father do a positive at the morgue.
29) 0) text: Sean sits across from Jimmy and Annabeth. A beat of surreal silence before Whitey arrives with four coffees.
29) 1) dialog: Fresh-brewed.
29) 8) dialog: What car?
29) 13) dialog: What time did Katie get home from work yesterday?
29) 15) dialog: Anything unusual? Out of the ordinary about her? 34.
29) 17) dialog: Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
29) 19) dialog: Do you know who she talked to?
29) 21) dialog: Would you mind if we subpoenaed the phone company records to that line? Annabeth looks over at Jimmy.
29) 23) dialog: Mr. Marcus, you spent a good part of Saturday with your daughter at the store, correct?
29) 25) dialog: You remember anything odd? A confrontation with a customer?
29) 27) dialog: What?
29) 29) dialog: The littlest thing is something right now.
29) 32) dialog: It's info. I collect it until a few pieces fit. Little things. You say you were in prison?
29) 33) dialog: I'm just asking.
29) 45) dialog: Mrs. Marcus? Who was she seeing?
29) 48) dialog: There'll be a trooper downstairs to drive you home. If you think of anything, give us a call. Whitey hands Jimmy his card. Jimmy nods good-bye, helps Annabeth away. Sean and Whitey watch as they head off.
29) 49) dialog: He said you almost got in some car when you were kids. What was that about? 37.
29) 51) dialog: Abduction?
29) 53) dialog: They catch the guys?
29) 55) dialog: Your buddy, Marcus. Moment I laid eyes on him, I knew he'd done time. They never lose the tension, you know? It settles in their shoulders.
29) 57) dialog: No. That's in his stomach. Notice how he kept grimacing? Seen it a million times. The shoulders, though, that's prison.
33) 2) dialog: Time of death roughly one-fifteen to one- thirty A.M. No sign of sexual assault. Cause of death most likely the gunshot wound to the back of the head, not the trauma from the beating she took. B.P.D. officers are on a house-to-house along Sydney to see if anyone heard anything.
33) 4) dialog: We're waiting on ballistics... The lack of footprints pisses me off. It rained. Still, she left some, but the perp? Nothing.
33) 6) dialog: She and her friends were bar-hopping. Four places. We're interviewing everyone might've seen or talked to them.
33) 7) dialog: One other thing. Backpack in her car had pamphlets on Las Vegas and a list of Vegas hotels.
33) 10) dialog: Four years of college and that's all you could come up with? 4l.
35) 0) text: An old lady, a busybody. She has one eye on the TV, the other on Sean and Whitey.
35) 4) dialog: Like hitting the curb?
38) 0) text: Crying, holding each other. Eve's FATHER looks on, back behind Sean and Whitey.
38) 6) dialog: Well, try us out, who was she dating?
38) 19) dialog: You got an address?
40) 0) text: Maybe the most miserable woman alive. She chain-smokes Parliaments, watches as Sean and Whitey question her son.
40) 1) dialog: When was the last time you saw Katie Marcus?
40) 5) dialog: So again, when's the last time you saw her?
40) 7) dialog: About like eight, Brendan, or at eight? If it's settled in Jimmy's stomach, it's settled in Brendan's whole body.
40) 14) dialog: Katie had brochures for Las Vegas. We heard she was going there. With you. As Esther rolls her eyes at the thought, Brendan nods his head. Yes. Esther flinches.
40) 21) dialog: Hey, boys.
40) 25) dialog: Where were you between twelve-thirty and two this morning?
40) 29) dialog: Brendan, we're going to ask you to take a polygraph. You up for that?
44) 6) dialog: Brendan Harris aced his polygraph. Four straight times.
44) 8) dialog: Yeah, poor fucking kid. Whitey starts casting about his desk.
44) 9) dialog: Ballistics should be in in a few hours. Meanwhile, we got that list of bar patrons. He finds it, hands Sean a list of about 100 names.
44) 10) dialog: I'm sure they're all just dying to cooperate with the police.
44) 12) dialog: (recognizes Dave Boyle) The same guy you were friends with as a kid? The car guy?
44) 14) dialog: He'd be a guy to talk to. He knows you, won't treat us like cops, clam up for no good reason.
45) 0) text: The door opens and Dave starts down the front steps with Michael. He stops short as a black unmarked pulls up. Sean and Whitey get out. Sean recognizes Dave.
45) 8) dialog: Sergeant Powers. How you doing? Whitey sticks out his hand. Dave shakes it, again trying not to wince.
45) 16) dialog: Girls keep getting murdered in Pen Park, Mr. Boyle; you might get your wish.
45) 23) dialog: Who's Celeste?
45) 30) dialog: We hear she and her friends put on quite a show. Dancing on the bar. They were pretty drunk, huh?
45) 34) dialog: So we'll say twelve-forty-five?
45) 45) dialog: I forgot to ask, sir. Where'd you go after you left McGill's?
45) 47) dialog: Home by one-fifteen would you say?
46) 0) text: Whitey and Sean exit with coffee. 61.
46) 1) dialog: Starbuck's. You believe this crap? Same as Dunkin' Donuts, except five times the price. As they sip, something else is really bothering them.
46) 2) dialog: You take away money or love or hate as possible motives, you're not left with much.
46) 4) dialog: Tell me about it. But the old lady, Prior, she didn't hear a scream. She heard a gunshot, and before that, a 'hi. Which means either the Marcus girl is pretty goddamn friendly or she knew him.
46) 6) dialog: She says hi, guy shoots her.
46) 8) dialog: But what makes her swerve without hitting the brakes?
46) 10) dialog: Maybe. Look, Marcus girl couldn't have weighed more than one-ten. How hard could she have hit the guy to get a head start into the park?
46) 12) dialog: Which explains the footprints. Three of hers. None of his.
46) 14) dialog: You honestly think that kid has it in him?
46) 16) dialog: Your pal, Dave, though. He's a slim guy.
46) 18) dialog: We're getting to him now.
46) 20) dialog: The last place she went, Sean, the last place. There's something wrong about that guy. (beat) Did you see his hand?
46) 22) dialog: Just a little one.
50) 0) text: Whitey and Sean get out of their car. At the same moment, Dave is exiting. He stops short, forces a smile.
50) 2) dialog: We're like two bad pennies.
50) 8) dialog: What happened to your hand, by the way? Dave stops short, manages a twisted grin. ANGLE TO INCLUDE SECOND FLOOR WINDOW Celeste looking down on them, listening.
50) 10) dialog: Painful.
50) 12) dialog: Garbage disposal. Bullshit.
51) 0) text: As Annabeth answers the door to reveal Sean and Whitey. Sean holds out a cigarette, smiles.
51) 16) dialog: What? A look passes between them.
51) 17) dialog: Better go get it. As Sean heads off after Celeste...
53) 3) dialog: Brendan Harris confirmed it. Jimmy shakes his head, trying to understand.
53) 12) dialog: Why's that?
53) 16) dialog: How about this, Mr. Marcus. We've been talking to witnesses, canvassing people who might've been in the bars and we've run into more than a few people, who were questioned before us by one or more of the Savage brothers.
53) 20) dialog: Just so we're clear, and with all due respect, this is our case.
53) 22) dialog: How long what?
53) 24) dialog: Are you bargaining with us?
53) 26) dialog: Are you giving us a deadline? (off no answer) We'll speak for Katie, Mr. Marcus. If that's okay? 71.
54) 0) text: Sean and Whitey head in, both feeling the effects of a long day. We walk and talk them inside.
54) 1) dialog: About the last thing we need right now are Marcus and the Savage brothers putting the fear of God into the neighborhood.
58) 7) dialog: A key? You think it was an inside job?
60) 2) dialog: I don't see it that way.
60) 4) dialog: You know how these things get passed around. Just Ray Harris may have blown town, but his gun never did.
60) 6) dialog: And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story? Huh? And the wife's definitely scared. 79.
60) 8) dialog: Boyle fits the profile a fucking T. White, mid-30a, marginally employed, sexually abused as a kid. You serious? On paper the guy should be in jail already.
60) 10) dialog: You were friends when you were kids. You're a fucking liability. Sean takes offense.
62) 0) text: Incredulity as Sean stares at Whitey.
62) 2) dialog: (smiling) His car was officially towed.
62) 4) dialog: Oh no. The car was found abandoned in Rome Basin along the parkway. Lucky for us the parkway's state jurisdiction. Some kids must've jacked it, took it for a joyride. Getting angry, Sean lowers his voice.
62) 6) dialog: After I dropped you off last night, I decided to talk to Boyle myself. Put a little fear in him. When I got to the house, I looked in his car, just to see what he had in there. Sean's shaking his head, not really listening until:
62) 7) dialog: I found blood.
62) 10) dialog: A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot more. Type O. Same as Katie Marcus. 82.
62) 12) dialog: I think it's enough to ask the man a few questions.
62) 14) dialog: No. Stolen and abandoned in state jurisdiction. For insurance purposes and in the best interest of the owner --
62) 16) dialog: Bingo. Now do you want to talk to him or should I send him home?
62) 18) dialog: Been sitting in the box for an hour. I had two of my ugliest troopers pick him up first thing. Hand slamming down on Plymouth roofs. Fists pounding on bulkheads. Feet on the cellar steps. BANG! BANG!
62) 20) dialog: Look, Mr. Boyle, we know you didn't get that swollen hand sticking it down a garbage disposal. 83.
62) 22) dialog: Why's your wife acting like she's afraid of you? Huh? She know what really happened to your hand? This is a cooler, tougher Dave than we've seen before.
62) 24) dialog: Tell us what really happened Saturday night, Mr. Boyle.
62) 26) dialog: You lied.
62) 28) dialog: You think this is funny?
62) 30) dialog: Tell us how the blood got in your car.
62) 32) dialog: Let's start with the front seat. Dave finally looks a little rattled. He looks to Sean.
62) 40) dialog: And what blood type are you?
62) 42) dialog: Hey, that's the match we got.
62) 44) dialog: Not quite. The blood in the trunk was not B negative.
62) 46) dialog: No idea how a half pint of blood got in your trunk?
62) 49) dialog: How's it going to look in court? You don't know how someone else's blood got in your trunk.
62) 51) dialog: What report?
63) 0) text: Sean and Whitey now on this side. Dave still sitting on the other. 86.
63) 2) dialog: I can break him.
63) 4) dialog: Yeah. But you still think old buddy Dave wouldn't hurt a fly? A moment as they both think.
63) 6) dialog: Maybe. Okay. Sean looks through the two-way at Dave.
63) 8) dialog: Fuck it. Kick him loose.
65) 2) dialog: Raymond Matthew Harris. Born nine-six- 1957. 1981 takes a job with the M.B.T.A. First child, Brendan Seamus born in 1983. Same year Just Ray is indicted in a scam to embezzle subway tokens. Charges dropped, but he's fired. Worked odd jobs after that, including clerk at Looney Liquors. Questioned in that robbery, questioned in another, same year; Blanchard Liquors in Middlesex County. Released on lack of evidence.
65) 4) dialog: He's getting popular. A known associate, one Edmund Reese, fingers Raymond in the 1985 heist of a rare comic book collection.
65) 6) dialog: A hundred fifty thousand dollars worth of comic books.
65) 8) dialog: Raymond returns said literature unharmed. Does a year solid inside. Comes out of prison with a wee chemical dependency problem.
65) 10) dialog: Apparently not. Picked up by a joint Major Crime Unit/F.B.I. sting for trafficking stolen goods across state lines. Stole a truckload of cigarettes.
65) 12) dialog: He's got a boatload of grief, too. Stole the truck in Rhode Island, drove it into Massachusetts.
65) 14) dialog: Hence, they got him by the balls. (flips page) But he does no time. Not a day.
65) 16) dialog: Looks that way. After that, nothing. He's clean. Until August 1989. Poof, he disappears. They consider it all a beat.
65) 18) dialog: Three, he went deep underground then just popped back in the neighborhood to kill his son's 19-year-old girlfriend. I mean, come on. We got nothing.
65) 21) dialog: Known criminal associates. Reginald 'Dukie' Neil, Kevin 'Whackjob' Sirraci, Nicholas Savage, hmmm, Anthony Waxman. Whitey suddenly looks up. And Sean knows it's here. 91.
65) 22) dialog: And one James Marcus.
66) 0) text: Sean and Whitey look up as 58-year-old AGENT BURDEN enters.
66) 10) dialog: On who? 92.
68) 0) text: Brendan sits across from Sean and Whitey. He looks confused, tired and scared.
68) 14) dialog: We were talking about your father’s gun. 96.
68) 20) dialog: He sends money?
68) 22) dialog: From where?
70) 0) text: Brendan's gone. Sean and Whitey are bleary, having huffed and puffed through the contents of the cardboard box.
70) 2) dialog: Absolutely. Told you three times already. What about the father? What do you think about him?
70) 4) dialog: Eighty grand. Who's going to send that if it's not the father?
70) 6) dialog: Go home. Have a drink. Let it go for awhile.
70) 9) dialog: Thought you listened to it. Sean sighs, sticks the tape into a player on his desk.
70) 19) dialog: Let's at least get a burger. Sean nods. Standing, he grabs his Glock and holster out of his top drawer. They start out; Sean freezes.
70) 21) dialog: What?
70) 26) dialog: Right. Dead girl, you refer to her as a she.
70) 28) dialog: Play it again.
76) 9) dialog: Kid, you need to point that gun at the floor. Okay?
76) 14) dialog: We'll arrest him for it if you want. Haul his ass to jail. 108.
