5) 2) dialog: Sorry. But I didn't want your dad to see me waiting.
5) 4) dialog: (between breaths) What'll he do if he sees this?
5) 6) dialog: It's been six hours. I had to see you. As the passion increases, Katie suddenly breaks off.
5) 8) dialog: Tomorrow. Like we planned.
5) 10) dialog: Drop me around the corner. Katie laughs, drives. As the car turns the corner, we look up to the TOBIN BRIDGE. A gloomy old erector set spanning the Mystic River. THUMPING with the passing CARS.
14) 0) text: The BELL RINGS. Jimmy looks up as Brendan Harris and his little brother Silent Ray enter. Ray carries his street hockey stick, a blankness living in his face. Brendan clocks Jimmy with a brief look of surprise before turning down an aisle. He talks to his brother with sign language. His brother's hands flying back answers.
14) 2) dialog: Uh, no, Mr. Marcus, just getting some of that tea my mom likes.
14) 4) dialog: Oh thanks. Hands fly again as Brendan and Silent Ray move an aisle over. As Pete returns from his smoke.
14) 8) dialog: And a Globe. While Jimmy is preoccupied and as Pete RINGS UP the sale.
14) 9) dialog: So's, ah, I thought Katie worked on Sundays.
14) 11) dialog: (laughs ) No, no, no. I was just wondering, you know, because usually I see her here.
14) 12) dialog: Oh... Not too happy to pick up Jimmy's attention, Brendan gets his change and starts out.
14) 13) dialog: Nice seeing you. Come on, Ray. Ray, his back to his brother when he spoke, turns and starts after him. Jimmy stares after them as they go.
40) 2) dialog: You don't think I hurt her, do you?
40) 4) dialog: I didn't kill her.
40) 6) dialog: Friday night. About, like, eight or so?
40) 8) dialog: About eight. We had a couple of slices at Hi-Fi. Then she had to go meet Eve and Diane. Brendan looks down. Esther crushes out her cigarette in a pile in the ashtray. Something still burns, a thin stream of smoke, corkscrewing up. As she lights another.
40) 10) dialog: I don't know. But he told Katie he never wanted her seeing me or any other Harris.
40) 12) dialog: He's not a thief.
40) 15) dialog: We were going to leave today. Get married when we got there. Brendan wipes the tears before they can fall.
40) 16) dialog: I mean, that was the plan, right?
40) 18) dialog: Ma, I --
40) 20) dialog: This is my brother Ray and his friend John.
40) 24) dialog: Yeah, they're here about Katie. Go watch TV or something. As the boys ramble out.
40) 26) dialog: Asleep.
40) 30) dialog: (nods; then) I loved her so much. I, I won't ever feel that again. I mean, it doesn't happen twice, right? He looks up, pain in his eyes you want to duck from.
57) 0) text: Celeste isn't the only one who's desolate tonight. Brendan Harris sits on the floor, his back against the wall. He stares at the bulging suitcase stowed just under his bed. He's never going to Las Vegas now. Least not with Katie. Finally, he closes his eyes, drops his chin to his chest and rocks a bit. Something comforting in that. The door opens as Silent Ray enters. Wearing his rollerblades, using his hockey stick as a staff. As he wobbles over and site on the bed, Brendan stands, wipes the tears from his face. Ray "signs" something to his brother. Ray "signs" again. Brendan gets angry.
57) 1) dialog: Mom said that? That I'm better off? Ray "signs" something. Brendan gets in his brother's face.
57) 2) dialog: I loved her. You know what that's like? Huh? Ray recoils, shakes his head. Brendan turns away, ashamed.
57) 3) dialog: Sorry... 73. Ray taps on the bedpost so that Brendan will look back over. Then he "signs" a final time.
57) 4) dialog: No, you're wrong. I won't feel it again. Not ever.
68) 0) text: Brendan sits across from Sean and Whitey. He looks confused, tired and scared.
68) 2) dialog: What?
68) 5) dialog: I remember little things. He smelled like Schlitz and Dentyne. He... A small smile slides softly across Brendan's face.
68) 7) dialog: Carried a lot of change in his pockets. It jingled when he walked. You could hear him when he came home. And if I could guess how much he had, if I was even close, he'd give it to me.
68) 9) dialog: What? No.
68) 15) dialog: I told you, my father didn't have a gun.
68) 17) dialog: Never. Said he was going out for a drink and he never came back. Brendan looks like he's in pain.
68) 19) dialog: Because he isn't missing. He sends money every month. Sean and Whitey exchange a surprised look.
68) 21) dialog: Five hundred dollars, every month. Like clockwork.
68) 23) dialog: Postmark says Brooklyn. Whitey picks up a pad of paper, starts to scribble.
68) 25) dialog: Who else would send it? My mom says that's how he was. Do something shitty then try to make up for it. Whitey hands Sean the pad. It’s years times months times $500. The underlined answer is $80,000.
68) 26) dialog: Why you asking me if my father had a gun? 97.
68) 28) dialog: No, I don't.
68) 31) dialog: My father didn't have a gun. Sean slaps the desktop, jerking Whitey to attention.
68) 33) dialog: Can I go now? Or are you gonna charge me with Katie's murder?
70) 0) text: Brendan's gone. Sean and Whitey are bleary, having huffed and puffed through the contents of the cardboard box.
72) 0) text: Seething purpose, Brendan enters, pulls a kitchen chair over to the butler's pantry. Standing on the chair, he looks up a beat at the slatted ceiling. He reaches up and presses with his right palm. A section of slats lifts up and away revealing an opening in the ceiling. Brendan looks up a beat, reaches into the black. 103.
72) 2) dialog: As he realizes he's not going to find it.
72) 3) dialog: No... He returns the slat to its place, steps off the chair. He brings the chair back to the kitchen table and site down on it. Sits down so he's facing the door in the center of the apartment. And as Brendan waits..
74) 0) text: And Silent Ray is arriving home with John O'Shea in tow. Brendan watches from the kitchen.
74) 1) dialog: Hey, Ray. Come in here a second. Ray comes in. John stops in the doorway holding a duffel bag. Brendan pulls a second chair out with his foot.
74) 2) dialog: Sit down, Ray. Ray catches a vibe, looks a little suspicious, but he sits.
74) 3) dialog: Who do you hate? 105. Ray stares back at him.
74) 4) dialog: Come on, who? Ray "signs" an answer.
74) 5) dialog: No one? Who do you love? Ray looks down at his shoes, then up at Brendan. Finally, he points a finger at his brother.
74) 6) dialog: You love me? (as Ray nods) What about Ma? Ray looks down again, shakes his head. "No."
74) 7) dialog: Okay. You love me so much, I want to hear you say it. Ray looks back up, confused.
74) 8) dialog: I know you can speak. So say you love me. Ray looks back over his shoulder at John.
74) 9) dialog: Don't look at him, look at me. Now say it, say you love me.
76) 0) text: Ray sitting across from Brendan, freaking out a little at his brother's request.
76) 1) dialog: Come on, say you love me. Finally Ray stands, holding his middle finger in Brendan's face and then turns to go. Brendan is on him in a flash. He grabs Ray by the hair and jerks him back. Ray flies over the kitchen table, slams into the wall and hits the floor.
76) 2) dialog: You love me so much you kill my fucking girl friend?! Huh? That gets John O'Shea moving. Motoring for the door. But Brendan's all over him. Grabbing him by the scruff of the neck, he bounces him off the door, spins him around.
76) 3) dialog: My brother never does anything without you, O'Shea! Never! Brendan punches him twice in the face, breaking his nose. John hits the floor, curls into a ball spitting blood.
76) 4) dialog: I'm coming back. He kicks John, heads back for Ray who's just standing. Brendan slaps him so hard he reels into the sink. Brendan grabs him by the shirt. Tears and blood stream down Ray's face. Brendan throws him to the floor. Spreading Ray's arms, Brendan kneels on him.
76) 5) dialog: Speak, you fucking freak or I swear I'll kill you! Speak! 107.
76) 7) dialog: Say her name! Katie! Say it or you die! As they start hard up the steps.
76) 18) dialog: What? What do you know? Sean looks back at John, down at Ray, then back to Brendan. Sean finally shakes his head.
