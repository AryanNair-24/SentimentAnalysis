7) 0) text: CELESTE BOYLE, 37, in her nightgown, leans against the door frame, looking in at her sleeping son Michael. She looks sad. At the click of the front door lock, she looks up.
7) 2) dialog: Dave, it's three in the morning. Where have you been? I was -- She stops short as she sees there's blood all over him. He stands there embarrassed, like he was ten years old.
7) 3) dialog: What happened?
7) 5) dialog: (stepping forward) Jesus, Dave, you have to go to the hospital.
8) 0) text: Dave, shirt off, holds his arm up, grimaces as Celeste dabs hydrogen peroxide on a sweeping gash along his rib cage.
8) 2) dialog: Oh God.
8) 4) dialog: That's what he said?
8) 6) dialog: I'm sorry, baby. He kisses her hand.
8) 8) dialog: Killed him? Dave nods. He's serious. Celeste looks at him. Eyes wide, face pale and sweaty. His breath starts to get a little ragged as he looks back. He's really scared.
8) 10) dialog: But you had to. Celeste embraces him. Over her shoulder:
8) 12) dialog: Baby, you hop in the shower. (beat) I'll take care of your clothes. 14. Dave's not sure what that means. Neither are we.
8) 14) dialog: Yeah.
19) 3) dialog: (low) There's nothing in the papers. I checked three times.
25) 0) text: Celeste washes dishes, scrubbing away like it means something. A portable TV on the counter. Suddenly: the TV newsroom.
34) 0) text: Annabeth and Celeste at the stove, cooking bacon and eggs. Neither talks, but they're happy for each other's company. A HUBBUB of VOICES from the hallway, up which Jimmy walks. Jimmy trades smiles with Celeste, then looks at Annabeth.
34) 3) dialog: We got things covered, Jimmy. Celeste watches as Jimmy looks at his wife. He reaches, wipes a bead of sweat off Annabeth's cheek with his finger.
36) 0) text: A throng already gathered. Celeste comes out to fill coffee cups. She looks across the room at Dave who's sandwiched between some of the Savage brothers. He sees her, smiles wanly. Very out of his element. And Celeste can feel his aloneness. As she smiles back... The DOORBELL RINGS. Jimmy gets it. It's his father-in- law, THEO SAVAGE, a case of beer on each shoulder.
41) 0) text: It's quiet. Sounds like the crowd is gone. Celeste tidies in the kitchen. Busy work really. Wiping down the toaster, wiping down already clean counters. I'd rather be here than home work. 52. Jimmy enters, is surprised to see her.
41) 2) dialog: Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
41) 5) dialog: Could I get one of those?
41) 7) dialog: I can stay over if you want. Sit up with Annabeth if she wakes up.
41) 10) dialog: I'll come by tomorrow. First thing.
43) 5) dialog: Is he asleep? Dave looks up, sees Celeste in the doorway. Dave nods, joins Celeste in...
43) 8) dialog: Okay.
43) 10) dialog: There's still nothing in the paper, Dave.
43) 12) dialog: About what?
43) 14) dialog: Right. Okay.
50) 14) dialog: Her breath starts to come in heaves. She looks like a bird in a cage. 66.
51) 6) dialog: Got a couple errands I gotta run. Be back in an hour or so.
51) 8) dialog: You sure?
51) 10) dialog: Uh, yeah.
51) 12) dialog: Nice to meet you. Well, I gotta go. 67. She squeezes past down the hall, headed for the door.
51) 14) dialog: Bye. And she's out the door. As Annabeth continues forward.
52) 0) text: As Celeste steps out, Sean is right behind her.
52) 3) dialog: Me?
52) 5) dialog: What?
52) 7) dialog: You think Dave killed Katie?
52) 9) dialog: I don't know.
52) 11) dialog: I was asleep.
52) 13) dialog: Saturday night, when Dave got home. I was asleep.
56) 0) text: Ugly even in moonlight, the sluggish current lapping toward the harbor locks. Celeste sits in her car, parked against the rotted pilings, staring out across the channel at Pen Park beyond. East Bucky rises like a landfill beyond, but Celeste's eyes fall somewhere in-between. On the silhouette of the derelict drive-in movie screen. Celeste's eyes are red. She's been crying. And she looks like she wants to die.
57) 0) text: Celeste isn't the only one who's desolate tonight. Brendan Harris sits on the floor, his back against the wall. He stares at the bulging suitcase stowed just under his bed. He's never going to Las Vegas now. Least not with Katie. Finally, he closes his eyes, drops his chin to his chest and rocks a bit. Something comforting in that. The door opens as Silent Ray enters. Wearing his rollerblades, using his hockey stick as a staff. As he wobbles over and site on the bed, Brendan stands, wipes the tears from his face. Ray "signs" something to his brother. Ray "signs" again. Brendan gets angry.
59) 0) text: As the door opens and Celeste comes home. The TELEVISION THROBS from the other room as she enters...
59) 3) dialog: Out... What are you watching?
59) 5) dialog: Was sitting in my car by the channel. I just needed to think, you know?
59) 7) dialog: Oh, you know.
59) 9) dialog: Things. The day, Katie being dead, poor Jimmy and Annabeth, those things.
59) 11) dialog: What about them?
59) 13) dialog: What the fuck are you talking about, Dave? Dave looks back at her, smiles a dark smile.
59) 15) dialog: You're not making any sense. 76.
59) 17) dialog: (looks away) I don't -- Where'd you come up with that?
59) 19) dialog: Dave...
59) 21) dialog: I don't think anything. I'm confused. Even your friend Sean --
59) 23) dialog: He asked me about you. What time you got home.
59) 25) dialog: I said I was asleep.
59) 27) dialog: Christ, Dave! Just tell them about the mugger! Please...
59) 30) dialog: What? Henry?
59) 32) dialog: What are you talking about?
59) 34) dialog: You mean all those years ago? When you were a boy? (touches him) Dave... Dave jerks away from her touch.
59) 36) dialog: What stays? 78.
59) 38) dialog: What?
59) 41) dialog: Okay... And then he goes. HOLD ON Celeste. As the front DOOR CLICKS shut, it might as well be a gunshot.
67) 0) text: Celeste. Pacing the sidewalk up from Jimmy's house. She stops, watches as Val's car pulls up and he and Jimmy get out. As they near the front steps, she hurries forward.
67) 1) dialog: Hey, Jimmy! Val!
67) 3) dialog: Jimmy, could I talk to you a sec?
67) 8) dialog: I took Michael and spent last night at a motel.
67) 10) dialog: I don't know, Jim. I may have left Dave for good.
67) 12) dialog: Yeah, well, he's been acting nuts lately. I'm, I'm almost afraid of him. She looks at Jimmy, sees a knowledge in him.
67) 13) dialog: (trembling) Do you know something?
67) 15) text: Celeste takes a deep breath.
67) 16) dialog: At three in the morning on Sunday, Dave came back to our apartment covered in someone's else's blood. Those words kill the noise along the avenue, stop the breeze. Right now they're the only two people on Earth.
67) 18) dialog: That he was mugged. That he bashed the mugger's head on the street. That he might've killed him. But there was nothing in the paper. Tears start to run down her face. She presses her forehead to Jimmy's chest. Finally, gently, Jimmy pushes her back. So he can look in her eyes.
67) 20) dialog: Yes.
