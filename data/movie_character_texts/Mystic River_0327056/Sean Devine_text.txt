Drinking beer, smoking Luckys and sharing a laugh. An 11-year-old boy leans on a street hockey stick, watches them. JIMMY MARCUS, unspent energy coiled tight in his chest. His friend SEAN DEVINE steps over, holds up an orange street hockey ball.
1) 0) text: Wearing a Red Sox cap, DAVE BOYLE stands eagerly before a makeshift chicken wire goalie net as Jimmy and Sean whack away at the orange ball with their street hockey sticks. As it bounces toward Dave, he takes an arcing swing at it. Connects. The ball sails.
1) 33) text: Get the fuck inside! Bawling, Dave climbs in. The Driver points a finger at Jimmy and Sean.
2) 0) text: Dinged and cracked with twenty years of age. There are the names: Jimmy, Sean and D-A. Forever.
6) 4) dialog: My old neighborhood. A FEMALE TROOPER joins them. Her uniform not drab enough to hide how sexy she is. She stares straight at Sean.
6) 6) dialog: No. We're fine.
6) 8) dialog: I don't think so, Jan. Thanks. Disappointed, she heads off. Whitey watches her ass.
6) 10) dialog: So?
6) 12) dialog: What's your point?
6) 14) dialog: I'm married, Whitey.
6) 16) dialog: She calls all the time.
6) 18) dialog: One of these days the phone'll ring and she'll talk. I'll pick it up and she'll tell me why she left. 11.
16) 0) text: Blue sawhorses stamped °BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT® cordon off the scene. The crime scene services van is parked further down. Sean Devine pulls up in an unmarked, gets out. He's met by his partner Whitey.
16) 2) dialog: (wincing) How much evidence you think they've destroyed so far? As they start toward the car, one of the cops adds local color as we hear him talk to his buddies.
16) 5) dialog: What do we got on the car so far?
16) 7) dialog: Shit.
16) 9) dialog: Maybe. Might be the daughter of a guy I know.
16) 11) dialog: Fuck. That's her.
16) 13) dialog: When we were kids. Now? Just a hello around the neighborhood.
18) 0) text: Sean looks the car over, puts the initial crime together.
18) 2) dialog: Perp stood outside the car. The Marcus girl slams him with the door. Perp gets a round off, hits her in the shoulder, maybe the biceps? She runs for it. (points into park) Through those trampled weeds.
20) 0) text: A nylon triangle hangs from a branch. Just under a footbridge over Pen Channel. The CSS Tech pinches it off with a pair of tweezers. It's got blood on it. Sean and Whitey crouch by the arch. There's a woman's shoe there along with several similar footprints. 24.
20) 2) dialog: Better call some divers while we're at it.
23) 0) text: Sean looking for something, anything. Whitey steps over. 26.
23) 3) dialog: (into walkie) Yeah, go ahead.
23) 5) dialog: Shit... (into walkie) You got a psychologist on scene yet?
23) 9) dialog: What guys?
23) 11) dialog: The Savage brothers. Christ. (into walkie) I'm on my way.
24) 7) dialog: Jimmy, hey, man.
24) 9) dialog: We don't know. All we're doing right now is looking.
24) 11) dialog: Sorry. As soon as I know anything, you'll know.
24) 13) dialog: I know. I --
24) 15) dialog: Because we're looking. Okay, Jimmy? Right now all she is is missing. Okay? As Jimmy nods, Sean's WALKIE CRACKLES TO LIFE right.
24) 17) dialog: Say again.
24) 19) dialog: Your location?
24) 21) dialog: Don't let him through. As Sean hurries off, Jimmy steps back alongside Val.
26) 0) text: Steps lead down to a door on the side of the screen. CSS flashbulbs pop. Whitey looks in, jots notes. An assistant MEDICAL EXAMINER is down on his knees looking at something. Plus a platoon of uniformed troopers and Boston PD blues. A BABY-FACED COP stares away from the action, being comforted by his partner as Sean passes on his way in.
26) 3) dialog: Yeah...
26) 6) dialog: What the fuck am I going to tell him. Hey guess what, Jimmy? God said you owed another marker. He came to collect. Sudden SHOUTS from outside, the K-9 DOGS BARK like mad. Sean springs up. As he and Whitey turn outside. 31.
26) 8) dialog: Hey! Hey! It's the father. Just pull him back. As Sean turns back to the screen:
28) 0) text: PUSH IN ON Katie. She lies on a metal table. Her eyes are closed and she's missing a shoe. Jimmy enters from the other way. Sean a step behind him. Jimmy stops short, opens his mouth to speak, but nothing comes out. Sean puts a hand on the small of his back.
29) 0) text: Sean sits across from Jimmy and Annabeth. A beat of surreal silence before Whitey arrives with four coffees.
29) 2) dialog: We need to work a timeline. It's the details, the little things that can make a case. Things you forget after a day or two. Annabeth nods that she understands. Jimmy's a little in shock. Lost a moment, then he looks to Sean.
29) 6) dialog: What do you mean, Jimmy?
29) 9) dialog: I'm losing you here, Jimmy.
29) 11) dialog: You ever see Dave around?
29) 35) dialog: Okay, let's forget it and get back to the point. Okay?
29) 37) dialog: Outside that look Katie gave you, was there anything else? Jimmy takes his convict-in-the-yard stare off Whitey, sips some coffee, does his genuine best to think.
29) 39) dialog: What? Remember, little things.
29) 41) dialog: You're sure? Could they have been dating?
29) 43) dialog: Why are you so sure?
29) 50) dialog: We, shit, well, there was this car. Me and Jimmy and a kid named Dave Boyle were playing in front of my house. And this car came up the street and took Dave away.
29) 52) dialog: Guys pretended to be cops. Convinced Dave to get in the car. They had him for four days before he managed to get away.
29) 54) dialog: One died, the other got busted about a year later and went the noose route in his cell.
29) 56) dialog: He just lost his daughter, man. Maybe that's what settled in his shoulders.
33) 9) dialog: We'll get the guy, sir. Friel nods, heads out.
33) 11) dialog: It made him happy, didn't it?
35) 0) text: An old lady, a busybody. She has one eye on the TV, the other on Sean and Whitey.
35) 2) dialog: Hit what, ma'am, another car?
35) 6) dialog: Someone said, 'hi'?
35) 8) dialog: Did you ever look out the window, Mrs. Prior?
35) 10) dialog: The voice that said, 'hi,' was it male or female?
35) 12) dialog: Sounds like she knew the shooter. 43.
38) 0) text: Crying, holding each other. Eve's FATHER looks on, back behind Sean and Whitey.
38) 2) dialog: Who was she dating?
38) 4) dialog: The Savage brothers?
38) 8) dialog: You guys had a good-bye dinner, didn't you?
38) 10) dialog: She was leaving town, wasn't she? Going to Las Vegas.
38) 12) dialog: She closed her bankbook, had hotel phone numbers.
38) 14) dialog: A nineteen-year-old girl doesn't go to Vegas alone. Who was she going with? Come on, Eve, who?
38) 16) dialog: Brendan Harris?
40) 0) text: Maybe the most miserable woman alive. She chain-smokes Parliaments, watches as Sean and Whitey question her son.
40) 3) dialog: She isn't hurt, Brendan, she's dead.
40) 9) dialog: Brendan, Jimmy Marcus doesn't like you. Why?
40) 27) dialog: Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?
40) 31) dialog: It doesn't happen once, most cases.
42) 0) text: Sean sits on the sofa looking through a shoe box of old photos. Mostly him and his wife, Lauren. But there's an older, thicker Polaroid: him, Jimmy and Dave when they were kids. As he stares, BLEED IN the sound of KIDS LAUGHING, the sound of a CAR ROLLING, STOPPING. The PHONE RINGS.
42) 1) dialog: Hello? No answer. A FLASH of a WOMAN'S HAND on the other end.
42) 2) dialog: Oh Christ. Say something, Lauren. He waits, thumbs a picture of his wife. Finally:
42) 3) dialog: I'm tired of wishing things made sense. Tired of caring about one dead girl because there'll be another one after her. And sending killers to jail is just sending them home. To the place they've been heading all their dumb, pathetic lives. And the dead are still dead. No response. Sean squeezes his eyes shut.
42) 4) dialog: Jesus, I can't do this tonight. I can't do it. He waits a few more seconds, can almost hear her breathing.
42) 5) dialog: Bye, baby. As he hangs up...
44) 7) dialog: Good. I didn't like him for it or want him for it.
44) 11) dialog: (scanning list) Considering the crime, maybe.
44) 13) dialog: Could be.
45) 0) text: The door opens and Dave starts down the front steps with Michael. He stops short as a black unmarked pulls up. Sean and Whitey get out. Sean recognizes Dave.
45) 1) dialog: Dave Boyle. What's it been? Seven, eight years? 57.
45) 4) dialog: Hey, Michael. I'm Sean, an old buddy of your dad.
45) 7) dialog: Yeah. Homicide now. Actually, this is my partner.
45) 9) dialog: Dave, you got a minute, we'd love to ask you a couple quick questions.
45) 11) dialog: Tell you what, we'll walk with you.
45) 13) dialog: I hear rents are rising.
45) 14) dialog: They cut my dad's old house up into condos. 58.
45) 21) dialog: You heard about Katie Marcus?
45) 25) dialog: How's Jimmy doing? Dave's getting a bit frazzled with all the little questions.
45) 27) dialog: The reason we came by -- 59.
45) 29) dialog: Well, yeah, Dave, that's why we're here. They were at a couple of bars that night. Your name showed up on a list of people who were in McGill's.
45) 32) dialog: What time did they leave?
45) 36) dialog: You see anything unusual that night? Anyone?
45) 38) dialog: Guy watching the girls? Guy with black hate in his eyes? Woman hater?
45) 43) dialog: God, I hated school.
45) 49) dialog: Good seeing you, Dave. Grab a beer sometime?
46) 0) text: Whitey and Sean exit with coffee. 61.
46) 3) dialog: If this Marcus thing was random, I mean, shit...
46) 5) dialog: But she didn't just stop. She turns into the curb. Not too fast or she would've hopped it. Foot comes off the clutch, she stalls.
46) 7) dialog: She slams her door into him, makes a run for it.
46) 9) dialog: Something in the road.
46) 11) dialog: Either he wasn't back on his heels or, he doesn't weigh so much himself. 62.
46) 13) dialog: It did rain... Brendan Harris couldn't be much more than one-fifty.
46) 15) dialog: No.
46) 17) dialog: How'd we get to him?
46) 19) dialog: Whitey, he's just a guy who was in the bar.
46) 21) dialog: Yeah... You seriously want to take a look at Dave Boyle?
50) 0) text: Whitey and Sean get out of their car. At the same moment, Dave is exiting. He stops short, forces a smile.
50) 4) dialog: Yeah. 65.
50) 6) dialog: Just paying our respects. Where you off to?
50) 13) dialog: Yeah, well, it doesn't mean he killed anybody either. Come on. As they start up the stairs...
51) 0) text: As Annabeth answers the door to reveal Sean and Whitey. Sean holds out a cigarette, smiles.
51) 1) dialog: Heard you could use one.
51) 4) dialog: Hey, whatever you need right now.
51) 9) dialog: Celeste Boyle?
51) 11) dialog: Sean Devine. I'm a friend of Dave's. From way back. He sticks out his hand. She shakes it reluctantly.
51) 15) dialog: Damnit.
52) 0) text: As Celeste steps out, Sean is right behind her.
52) 1) dialog: Celeste... She looks back in pure terror.
52) 2) dialog: Could I ask you a quick question?
52) 4) dialog: What time did Dave come home on Saturday night?
52) 6) dialog: (smiles) It's a little thing. We need to run timelines on anything involving Katie. I'm sure Dave told you he saw her at McGill's on Saturday night. 68.
52) 8) dialog: I didn't say that, Celeste. Hell, why would I even think it? Celeste tries to laugh it off.
52) 10) dialog: We could figure what time she was on the road if we knew what time Dave got home. That's all. It's five minutes from McGill's to your place, Katie left fifteen minutes before Dave did. See what I mean?
52) 12) dialog: Huh?
52) 14) dialog: Oh... Well, thanks anyway. As she hurries off...
53) 2) dialog: No. He was dating Katie, Jim. They were going to elope to Las Vegas. We found reservations under their names with United. 69.
53) 6) dialog: No.
53) 8) dialog: He passed a poly with flying colors. Plus, he seemed, to me, like he really loved her.
53) 10) dialog: Jimmy, I'm just curious, man. Why are you so dead set against the kid? He said Katie told him you'd disown her if she ever dated a Harris.
53) 18) dialog: So the Savage brothers are not policemen, Jimmy.
54) 0) text: Sean and Whitey head in, both feeling the effects of a long day. We walk and talk them inside.
54) 2) dialog: Those brothers, man. We grew up terrified of them. Eleven months apart. Like they were running a loose cannon factory. They're interrupted by a LAB TECH.
54) 4) dialog: Yeah? Got a match?
55) 2) dialog: The Flats?
58) 2) dialog: Scary, huh?
58) 4) dialog: (smiles) Take me through it. So these two guys...
58) 9) dialog: And you told the police that at the time?
58) 11) dialog: You still have those employment records?
58) 13) dialog: Yeah?
58) 15) dialog: You remember his name?
60) 0) text: As they pull up across from Sean's car. Another long day by the boards.
60) 1) dialog: I just think the gun sends us in a different direction.
60) 3) dialog: What does Just Ray Harris's gun have to do with Dave Boyle?
60) 5) dialog: I say we talk to Brendan Harris again. First thing in the morning.
60) 7) dialog: They're hiding something, but Dave's about as much a killer as I guess Brendan Harris is.
60) 9) dialog: No, Katie Marcus was not sexually abused. In that equation, sexual emission is part of the deal.
60) 11) dialog: He's not my friend. Turns out you're right? I'll have my cuffs off my hip faster than yours.
62) 0) text: Incredulity as Sean stares at Whitey.
62) 1) dialog: You stole his car?
62) 3) dialog: From the front of his house?
62) 5) dialog: Why'd you do it?
62) 8) dialog: What?
62) 9) dialog: How much?
62) 11) dialog: Wait a minute. Katie Marcus never got in anyone's trunk. She stalled her car, got chased through the park until she died in the park.
62) 13) dialog: For what? Your search of the cars's going to get tossed out.
62) 15) dialog: You did a physical search and filed a report.
62) 17) dialog: Dave's here?
62) 34) dialog: Sure. 84. As Sean reaches for the door, Dave smiles.
62) 36) dialog: Ain't your bitch, Dave. Looks like you'll have to wait.
62) 38) dialog: The blood on your front seat, Dave. Answer the Sergeant.
62) 48) dialog: This is not the way you want to go, Dave.
63) 0) text: Sean and Whitey now on this side. Dave still sitting on the other. 86.
63) 1) dialog: You got too fucking smart. Car's inadmissible. His lawyer can say anything in it was put there by the car thieves.
63) 3) dialog: Break him? He just kicked our asses in there.
63) 5) dialog: It's the gun, Whitey. We bust this open on that gun.
63) 7) dialog: What about Dave?
65) 3) dialog: Beginning to become known though.
65) 5) dialog: Comic books? You go, Raymond.
65) 7) dialog: Oh, excuse me.
65) 9) dialog: But gets honest work to support the habit, right?
65) 11) dialog: Our boy's got style. 90.
65) 13) dialog: Hence the federal interstate rap.
65) 15) dialog: He rolled on someone.
65) 17) dialog: One, he's dead. Two, he's in Witness Protection.
65) 19) dialog: We got a guy who was a prime suspect in a robbery eighteen years ago during which the murder weapon was used. Guy's son dated the victim. I'd say we got a lot. Whitey flips through the file. Sean realizes something.
65) 20) dialog: Anything in there about Just Ray's known associates? Whitey flips, looks, finds it.
65) 23) dialog: And the hits just keep coming.
66) 0) text: Sean and Whitey look up as 58-year-old AGENT BURDEN enters.
66) 2) dialog: I'm Sean Devine, this is Whitey Powers. They all shake hands.
66) 4) dialog: You worked a task force with Major Crimes in the '80s.
66) 6) dialog: You took down a small-timer. Ray Harris. Stole a truck full of cigarettes from a rest stop in Cranston, Rhode Island.
66) 8) dialog: But Harris walked.
66) 12) dialog: Did Ray Harris testify in open court?
66) 14) dialog: So Jimmy Marcus never knew Ray Harris ratted him out? Burden looks at the two of them a beat, smiles.
68) 0) text: Brendan sits across from Sean and Whitey. He looks confused, tired and scared.
68) 1) dialog: Tell me about your father, Brendan.
68) 3) dialog: Your father. Raymond Senior. You remember him. 95.
68) 4) dialog: So you don't remember the guy?
68) 6) dialog: He what, Brendan?
68) 8) dialog: What about a gun? You remember your father having a gun?
68) 10) dialog: You seem awful sure for someone who was only six when he left. A DETECTIVE comes in, sets a cardboard box on Sean's desk.
68) 11) dialog: What's this?
68) 13) dialog: Thanks. As he moves off...
68) 16) dialog: I guess we were misinformed. You talk to your father much?
68) 18) dialog: Your mother never filed a missing persons report. How came?
68) 24) dialog: How do you know it's him?
68) 27) dialog: You know why, kid.
68) 29) dialog: The gun that killed your girlfriend was the same gun your father used in a robbery eighteen years ago. Something dark starts working through Brendan's brain. Some new and sudden knowledge. Sean sees it.
68) 30) dialog: You want to tell me about it?
68) 32) dialog: You are fucking lying! But Brendan doesn't react. He's gone somewhere else. Somewhere grim and hard.
70) 0) text: Brendan's gone. Sean and Whitey are bleary, having huffed and puffed through the contents of the cardboard box.
70) 1) dialog: The kid was lying about the gun. Don't you think?
70) 3) dialog: I think, just possibly now, that Just Ray is still alive.
70) 5) text: Sean sticks his head in his hands, groans in frustration.
70) 7) dialog: Yeah, right. Sean looks into the box. All that's left is a cassette tape. He pulls it out.
70) 8) dialog: Anything good on the 9-1-1 call?
70) 18) dialog: Well, that breaks the case wide open. 100.
70) 20) dialog: Her.
70) 22) dialog: The kid on the tape. Sean hits rewind, play.
70) 25) dialog: He said, ‘her name.'
70) 27) dialog: But how does the kid know that? She'd dead in the park. How does he know the blood in the car came from a woman.
76) 12) dialog: No. I don't want to hurt a kid. And it looks like someone else beat me to it. John remembers. Looks quite deadly.
76) 16) dialog: Motherfucker. Whitey kneels to cuff John who's now crying like a baby. Sean walks forward toward Brendan. Brendan slides off his brother, just sits on the floor looking up at Sean. Sean shrugs, almost apologetically.
76) 17) dialog: We know.
76) 19) dialog: Nothing.
78) 0) text: Where it all began. Jimmy sits on the curb, by the sidewalk where they once wrote their names. Jimmy, Sean and half of Dave. Jimmy sips his bourbon from a pint. A car pulls up across the street. Sean. He walks over.
78) 1) dialog: Annabeth said you might be here. (re: bourbon) Tough night? Jimmy nods.
78) 2) dialog: Me, too. Saw a bullet with my name on it. 115. Jimmy holds up the pint. Sean takes it, swallows a long pull. As he hands it back...
78) 3) dialog: We got them.
78) 5) dialog: Katie's killers. Got them cold. It's trying to get in, but it hasn't sunk yet.
78) 7) dialog: Kids, actually. Ray Harris's son, Ray Junior, and a kid John O'Shea. They confessed a couple hours ago.
78) 9) dialog: None.
78) 11) dialog: They don't know. They were playing with a gun. Saw a car coming so one of them lies down in the middle of the street. Car swerves, clutch kicks out. Katie. O'Shea says they meant to just scare her, but the gun went off. She hit him with the door and ran. They chased her so she wouldn't tell no one.
78) 13) dialog: Ray Junior had a hockey stick. Jimmy looks around. It's sinking now. Sean crouches down beside him.
78) 14) dialog: Go easy, Jim. Take a breath. (beat) (MORE )
78) 16) dialog: Look at me. I got a call from Celeste Boyle. She was hysterical. She said Dave's missing. Said you might know where he is. Jimmy looks at Sean, but can't find any words.
78) 17) dialog: We need to talk to him. Boston police found the body of a guy this morning. In the woods behind McGill's.
78) 19) dialog: A pedophile with three priors. They want to talk to Dave about it. Jimmy lurches up past Sean. Trying to get a grip.
78) 20) dialog: When was the last time you saw Dave, Jimmy? Finally, standing there in the middle of the street...
78) 22) dialog: Yeah, Dave Boyle.
78) 25) dialog: You going to send Celeste five hundred a month, too? Eyes brimming, Jimmy looks back up the street. Sean does the same. Right where they were when Dave was driven away. 117.
78) 26) dialog: Sometimes I think, I think all three of us got in that car. And all this, it's just a dream.
78) 28) dialog: In reality we're still eleven-year-old boys trapped in a cellar. Imagining what our lives would have been if we'd escaped.
78) 30) dialog: Hello? No answer. HIGHWAY sounds from the other end. Sean knows who it is, finally knows what to say...
78) 31) dialog: I'm sorry... I need you to know that. I pushed you away. A long pause.
78) 33) dialog: Come home.
78) 35) dialog: Everything's just the way you left it.
78) 37) dialog: What's that?
78) 39) dialog: Nora... And Sean starts to walk toward his car, still talking on the phone, laughing. And as the SOUND FADES OFF, we HOLD ON the sidewalk, on the names written so long ago.
80) 0) text: It streams along. Sean stands watching with his wife Lauren and his baby daughter. A float passes by filled with children who shout, laugh and wave. All except for one who's lost, sad, haunted. The child's eyes find Sean's for just an instant and then he's gone. Sean snaps from the sudden trance, looks across the street at Jimmy, Annabeth, their daughters and a few of the Savage brothers. Waving at the parade, happy and strong. Suddenly aware of being watched, Jimmy's head swivels. His eyes lock on Sean's. Jimmy gives Sean the smallest smile. And Sean points a "finger gun." Drops his thumb on the imaginary hammer. And as Jimmy's smile widens... FADE TO BLACK.
