1) 0) text: Wearing a Red Sox cap, DAVE BOYLE stands eagerly before a makeshift chicken wire goalie net as Jimmy and Sean whack away at the orange ball with their street hockey sticks. As it bounces toward Dave, he takes an arcing swing at it. Connects. The ball sails.
1) 33) text: Get the fuck inside! Bawling, Dave climbs in. The Driver points a finger at Jimmy and Sean.
2) 2) dialog: You took some good swings today.
2) 4) dialog: Good swings though. That's what counts.
2) 6) dialog: Hey, you're my son. Me. Dave Boyle, star shortstop of Don Bosco High School 1978 to 1982. You're going to be a great ballplayer. Michael's not so sure. Dave sees something ahead, points.
2) 7) dialog: See that gutter drain? I used to play on this street when I was a kid. That drain used to swallow every ball we had. They start walking again, Michael listening eagerly.
2) 8) dialog: Baseballs, street hockey balls, pinkies. If we could get the manhole cover off, there'd be a thousand balls down there.
2) 11) dialog: Maybe tomorrow. Let's get home before Mom starts to worry. They continue. As Dave looks back over his shoulder...
6) 22) dialog: Come on. Double play. At the sound of a cheer (not for the Sox), the Friend looks back over his shoulder, nudges Dave in the ribs.
6) 25) dialog: Yeah... We CLOSE ON Dave as he seems suddenly lost in the moment.
6) 26) dialog: I remember when she was a kid. 12.
7) 4) dialog: I tucked up. The guy tried to mug me, right? So, so I swung on him. And he sliced me. He clutches at his side. Celeste sees that it's crimson.
7) 6) dialog: No, no. It's not that deep. It just bled like hell.
8) 0) text: Dave, shirt off, holds his arm up, grimaces as Celeste dabs hydrogen peroxide on a sweeping gash along his rib cage.
8) 1) dialog: I'm walking to my car and this guy comes up to me, asks for a light. I say I don't smoke. Guy says neither does he. So my heart starts clocking a buck fifty ‘cause there's no one around but me and him. 13.
8) 3) dialog: That's when I see the knife and he says, "Your wallet or your life, bitch. I'm leaving with one of 'em.,
8) 5) dialog: Yeah. So, so then I try to brush past him and that's when he slices me. Celeste, can I tell the fucking story? She touches his cheek.
8) 7) dialog: I went fucking nuts on him, babe. I went off. I bashed his head on the parking lot. I, I might have killed him, honey.
8) 9) dialog: It makes you feel alone. Hurting someone.
8) 11) dialog: It makes you feel... alien. Celeste looks at him, suddenly filling with strength.
8) 13) dialog: Yeah?
19) 2) dialog: The man, waking up with a start in his bed. INT. BOYLE APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- DAY Michael sits at the table eating cereal. Celeste is at the counter flipping through the last of three different newspapers. She looks up as Dave enters, yawning, just rolled out of bed. He goes to the refrigerator without an apparent care in the world. CELESTE Dave... He looks over, clocks the look on her face. He steps over.
19) 4) dialog: It was late. Real late. He kisses her forehead. She manages a smile.
19) 5) dialog: Morning, Mikey. You up for hitting some whiffle ball?
30) 0) text: Along the Mystic River. Dave Boyle walks, hands thrust in his pockets. Prostitutes blend in the shadows of doorways, lean into the windows of IDLING CARS. Some take a half-step in the streetlight to show Dave what they got. 38. But he continues forward, not interested. Last of all, a kid, a boy, fifteen at the most. Lighting a smoke, he looks up, smiles around the cigarette. Dave stops. The kid's eyes suddenly widen in recognition and he bolts. Dave follows a few steps, but the kid's already disappeared into the darkness.
30) 1) dialog: I just want to talk to you!
32) 4) dialog: I wasn't going to talk to you tonight, but I was out for a walk and saw you sitting here.
32) 6) dialog: So you know, me and Celeste, the whole neighborhood, if you need anything, anything, we're here.
32) 8) dialog: I'll leave you alone. As Dave starts away.
32) 11) dialog: House full of people all day.
32) 13) dialog: Sure, Jimmy. You got it. Dave gives another little wave, starts on his way. 40.
36) 0) text: A throng already gathered. Celeste comes out to fill coffee cups. She looks across the room at Dave who's sandwiched between some of the Savage brothers. He sees her, smiles wanly. Very out of his element. And Celeste can feel his aloneness. As she smiles back... The DOORBELL RINGS. Jimmy gets it. It's his father-in- law, THEO SAVAGE, a case of beer on each shoulder.
39) 0) text: Jimmy sits on the deck. Sits by himself under the clothesline stretched across the porch. Sits beneath the flapping clothes. The sounds of the WAKE drift out as he stares up at the sky. Dave steps out. Unaware of Jimmy, he steps to the rail, lights a cigarette.
39) 2) dialog: (turns; surprised) Hey, Jimmy. Sorry. Came out for a smoke.
39) 5) dialog: How you doing? Jimmy shrugs. He sees that Dave's right hand is swollen.
39) 7) dialog: This? I was helping a buddy move a couch. Slammed it into the doorjamb. Jimmy tilts his head, looks at the badly-scraped knuckles, the bruised flesh between the fingers.
39) 8) dialog: The ways you can manage to hurt yourself, right? Jimmy looks into his face, forgets his hand.
39) 10) dialog: Yeah?
39) 12) dialog: They're okay, I guess.
39) 15) dialog: Yeah. Jimmy jerks a thumb over his shoulder.
39) 17) dialog: It's a lot of waste, huh?
39) 21) dialog: Jim?
39) 23) dialog: You're crying now.
39) 25) dialog: Want me to leave you alone?
39) 27) dialog: Sure, Jim. That's cool. 49.
42) 0) text: Sean sits on the sofa looking through a shoe box of old photos. Mostly him and his wife, Lauren. But there's an older, thicker Polaroid: him, Jimmy and Dave when they were kids. As he stares, BLEED IN the sound of KIDS LAUGHING, the sound of a CAR ROLLING, STOPPING. The PHONE RINGS.
43) 0) text: In bed, under the covers, trying to stay awake as his Dad tells him a bedtime story. Dave sits on the edge of the bed, speaking in a hushed tone. 54.
43) 1) dialog: Because sometimes the man wasn't a man at all. He was the boy. The boy who'd escaped from wolves. An animal of the dusk. Invisible. Silent. Living in a world others never saw, a world of fireflies. Unseen except as a flare in the corner of your eye. Vanished by the time you turned your head toward it.'
43) 4) dialog: I just need to get my head right. Catch a nice long sleep and the boy will go back to his forest. Back to his fireflies.
43) 7) dialog: How's Jimmy and everybody?
43) 9) dialog: It's weird, took something like this for me and him to become friends again.
43) 11) dialog: About what? 55.
43) 13) dialog: Oh, I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't hurt the guy as bad as I thought. And he was a mugger; he's not going to the hospital.
43) 15) dialog: Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it? I mean, Katie Marcus is dead, and that seems more important right now. Celeste nods. She starts to reach for him, stops. As she turns and disappears down the hall, Dave watches her go.
45) 0) text: The door opens and Dave starts down the front steps with Michael. He stops short as a black unmarked pulls up. Sean and Whitey get out. Sean recognizes Dave.
45) 2) dialog: Hey, Sean. Stepping forward, Sean shakes his hand. Dave grimaces.
45) 3) dialog: This is my son. Michael.
45) 6) dialog: You still with the Staties?
45) 10) dialog: Actually, I got to walk Michael to school, but I could be back in a few minutes.
45) 12) dialog: Uh, sure. They start walking.
45) 15) dialog: Me and Michael walked by there the other day. There's got to be a way to stop them. Friend of mine said the other day, Sean, he said, what this neighborhood needs is a good fucking crime wave. That'd send property values back where they belong.
45) 17) dialog: Dave. Call me Dave.
45) 19) dialog: Walk up on ahead, Michael. Us guys have to talk. Michael sighs, takes a few steps ahead.
45) 20) dialog: What's up, Sean?
45) 22) dialog: Yeah. I was at Jimmy's all day yesterday. Celeste's there now.
45) 24) dialog: My wife.
45) 26) dialog: Hard to tell. You know him.
45) 28) dialog: I saw her. Katie. I don't know if you know that. At McGill's. The night she died.
45) 31) dialog: Yeah, but it was harmless. They weren't stripping or nothing. They were just, nineteen, you know?
45) 33) dialog: I left at one. They left maybe fifteen minutes before me.
45) 35) dialog: Sounds about right.
45) 37) dialog: Like what?
45) 39) dialog: No. If they hadn't danced on the bar, it would've been business as usual, you know? Sean nods. They've reached the school. 60.
45) 41) dialog: Got your milk money?
45) 44) dialog: Huh? Yeah, me, too.
45) 46) dialog: Uh, home.
45) 48) dialog: Roughly. Sure. An almost embarrassed silence until...
45) 50) dialog: Yeah, Sean, I'd like that. Sean and Whitey start back down the sidewalk. Dave watches them go. Sean waves once over his shoulder and Dave finds himself waving back even though Sean can't see him.
50) 0) text: Whitey and Sean get out of their car. At the same moment, Dave is exiting. He stops short, forces a smile.
50) 1) dialog: You guys again? Whitey's smile isn't as forced.
50) 3) dialog: You dropping in on Jimmy?
50) 5) dialog: Did you have some kind of, what, break in the case?
50) 7) dialog: Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes. I'm going to get some. See you in a minute. As Dave moves past them, Whitey does his best Columbo.
50) 9) dialog: Huh? Oh, garbage disposal. It was jammed and I stuck my hand down there. Then it started up again. Stupid, huh?
59) 2) dialog: Where you been? 75.
59) 4) dialog: Some vampire movie. Guy just got his head torn off... Where'd you go, Celeste?
59) 6) dialog: So what'd you think about?
59) 8) dialog: Not really, baby, no.
59) 10) dialog: Those things. Know what I was thinking about? Huh? Vampires. Celeste wants to run screaming, but...
59) 12) dialog: They're undead, but I think maybe there's something beautiful about it. Maybe one day you wake up and you forget. What it's like to be human. Maybe then it's okay.
59) 14) dialog: Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.
59) 16) dialog: You think I killed Katie, Celeste? That the kind of sense we're making these days?
59) 18) dialog: You've barely looked at me since you found out Katie was dead. In fact, you seem like you're repulsed by me.
59) 20) dialog: What?
59) 22) dialog: He's not my friend. Case you haven't figured that out yet.
59) 24) dialog: What did you tell him?
59) 26) dialog: Good thinking, baby.
59) 28) dialog: The mugger. I see how your mind's working. I do. I come home with blood on me the same night Katie's murdered. I must have killed her. 77. Celeste just looks at him. Horrified. And Dave starts to laugh. Laughs hysterically. Celeste is horrified. She opens her mouth to say something, but nothing comes out. Finally, as Dave's laughter starts to trail...
59) 29) dialog: Ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha... Henry.
59) 31) dialog: Henry and George, Celeste. I never told anyone before, but those were their names. Isn't that fucking hilarious? At least that's what they called themselves. But they were wolves and Dave, Dave was the boy who escaped from wolves.
59) 33) dialog: I'm talking Henry and George. They took me for a four-day ride. And they buried me in this ratty old cellar with a sleeping bag, and, man, Celeste, did they have their fun. And no one came to help old Dave then. Dave had to pretend to be someone else.
59) 35) dialog: Dave's dead. I don't know who came out of that cellar, but it sure as shit wasn't Dave! (calms ) The thing is, it's like vampires, once it's in you, it stays.
59) 37) dialog: Did you know there were child prostitutes in Rome Basin?
59) 39) dialog: I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste. I'm warning you. I can't trust my mind. It's official: Celeste has never been more afraid in her whole life.
59) 40) dialog: I'm going out. I just need to get my head around it.
61) 0) text: Jimmy sits on the front porch, thinking. He looks up at someone walking down the sidewalk. It's Dave.
61) 1) dialog: Hey, Jimmy.
61) 3) dialog: You, too. Jimmy nods. It is what it is. Dave leans against the porch, looks about.
61) 4) dialog: Nice night, huh? The words 80.
61) 6) dialog: I saw her, you know.
61) 8) dialog: Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night?
61) 10) dialog: (nods ) Never got around to telling you. Jimmy's eager for some final word on his daughter.
61) 12) dialog: No. I just nodded hello at one point. Next time I looked up she was gone.
61) 14) dialog: She looked...happy. Jimmy nods, wipes an unexpected tear from his eye.
61) 15) dialog: Got some more walking to do. Good night.
62) 21) dialog: Yeah? How do you know that?
62) 23) dialog: How about a Sprite or something?
62) 25) dialog: I already did.
62) 27) dialog: (shrugs ) Your opinion. Which I guess you're entitled to.
62) 29) dialog: No I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over, and not only was my car stolen, but now you're telling me you won't release it to me.
62) 31) dialog: What blood?
62) 33) dialog: You think I could get that Sprite, Sean?
62) 35) dialog: I get it. You're the good cop. How about a meatball sub while you're at it? Any signs of being rattled are gone. Is Dave playing them? Sean lets go of the doorknob, leans back to where he was.
62) 37) dialog: You're somebody's bitch, though. Aren't you, Sean? There's a crazy leer in Dave's eyes, a preening cockiness.
62) 39) dialog: We got a chain-link fence in our back yard. Me and my kid play Whiffle ball every afternoon after school and he's getting pretty good. Most of the balls are on the other side of the fence. So I climb it. Except I slip on the top and slice myself where the links curl in. (pats his ribs) Right here. Bled like hell. Ten minutes later, I had to pick up Michael. It was probably still bleeding when I got in the seat. Best I can figure.
62) 41) dialog: B negative.
62) 43) dialog: Well, there you go. 85.
62) 45) dialog: I don't know anything about any blood in my trunk.
62) 47) dialog: None.
62) 50) dialog: Fine, I suppose. You filed the report.
62) 52) dialog: The stolen car report. Whitey and Sean both get the same sinking feeling.
62) 53) dialog: The car wasn't in my possession last night. Whatever the car thieves used it for, you should find out. Because it sounds like they were up to no good. A long silence. Whitey's fucked. Sean looks at the floor, shakes his head ever so slightly.
62) 54) dialog: Things looking any better on that Sprite?
63) 0) text: Sean and Whitey now on this side. Dave still sitting on the other. 86.
69) 0) text: walking down Crescent Avenue. A car pulls alongside... FLASHBACK -— PLYMOUTH Pulling up across from Young Dave before he can finish writing his name in the sidewalk.
69) 3) dialog: Hey, Val? What're you up to?
69) 5) dialog: Yeah?
69) 7) dialog: I'll have to get home at some point.
69) 9) dialog: (smiles) First round's mine.
71) 0) text: A dive backed up against the river. A few old-timers, a few pool tables. Dave and Val sit in a booth. There are four empty shot glasses and a nearly empty pitcher of beer.
71) 3) dialog: And you guys didn't notice?
71) 5) dialog: Why do you think be went straight?
71) 7) dialog: What about you?
71) 9) dialog: I should slow down. Till we eat.
71) 12) dialog: I'm a little drunk. You gain some weight? You look bigger. Jimmy smiles, passes out the shots.
71) 17) dialog: Absolutely. It's the funniest thing Val ever heard.
73) 0) text: Dave's having trouble focusing. Jimmy and Val seem like they've forgotten he's here.
73) 6) dialog: Oh shit...
73) 8) dialog: I'm going to be sick. A flicker of a look between Val and Jimmy. Val slides out.
75) 0) text: Out back. One light over the door. And we're TRACKING BACK WITH Dave as he stumbles through the weeds. Drops to his hands and knees at the edge of the Mystic River. We're BACK BEHIND as he heaves, empties his stomach into the dirty water. Finally, he lurches to his feet, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. He takes a few deep breaths, feels better. And when Dave finally turns around, Jimmy and Val are standing there. One on either side of the door, the light bulb burning between them. Dave grins. 106.
75) 1) dialog: Hey, guys. Come to make sure I didn't fall in?
77) 0) text: Jimmy puts his arm around Dave's shoulder, leads him along the river. Val walks a few paces behind.
77) 2) dialog: Shit. That's terrible.
77) 4) dialog: I remember, man. I -- They stop. 109.
77) 6) dialog: Why are you telling me this? Jimmy points. Far below the Tobin Bridge, at a rotted cluster of pilings, a small boat with an outboard motor tied up.
77) 8) dialog: Hey, Jimmy, I don't --
77) 10) dialog: What is it you think I did, Jimmy?
77) 12) dialog: You think I killed Katie, don't you?
77) 14) dialog: No, no, no. I killed someone, but it wasn't Katie.
77) 16) dialog: He wasn't a mugger. He, he was a child molester. He was having sex with this kid in his car. He was a wolf; he was. a vampire.
77) 20) dialog: Yeah, well, me and the boy.
77) 22) dialog: No.
77) 26) dialog: No, no, forget that. My head gets fucked up sometimes. I --
77) 28) dialog: I, I don't know. Maybe I thought I was turning into him. I didn't kill Katie!
77) 30) dialog: I put him in the trunk of my car. Dumped his body in the woods --
77) 36) dialog: Look at me, Jimmy.
77) 43) dialog: Me and my son, me and Celeste, there's so many things to make right.
77) 45) dialog: No more lies, no more secrets, I want to go home to Celeste. I want to feel Celeste.
77) 47) dialog: The boy...
77) 50) dialog: Yeah, yeah, I did it. Jimmy closes his eyes, lowers the knife. Val can't believe what he's watching.
77) 52) dialog: That night in McGills, she reminded me of a dream I've had.
77) 54) dialog: A dream of youth. I don't remember having one. And she was the dream of it, and I just snapped. Jimmy opens his eyes again. He's trembling.
77) 56) dialog: The dream, yeah. You'd know what I mean. If you'd got in that car instead of me.
77) 62) dialog: I wasn't ready.
78) 0) text: Where it all began. Jimmy sits on the curb, by the sidewalk where they once wrote their names. Jimmy, Sean and half of Dave. Jimmy sips his bourbon from a pint. A car pulls up across the street. Sean. He walks over.
