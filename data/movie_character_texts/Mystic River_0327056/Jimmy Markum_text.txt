0) 0) text: Postage stamp size. Clothes on the line. The sunlight cut by the cramped crowd of houses. We're already PULLING AWAY FROM the backs of two men. Drinking beer, smoking Luckys and sharing a laugh. An 11-year-old boy leans on a street hockey stick, watches them. JIMMY MARCUS, unspent energy coiled tight in his chest. His friend SEAN DEVINE steps over, holds up an orange street hockey ball.
1) 0) text: Wearing a Red Sox cap, DAVE BOYLE stands eagerly before a makeshift chicken wire goalie net as Jimmy and Sean whack away at the orange ball with their street hockey sticks. As it bounces toward Dave, he takes an arcing swing at it. Connects. The ball sails.
1) 33) text: Get the fuck inside! Bawling, Dave climbs in. The Driver points a finger at Jimmy and Sean.
2) 0) text: Dinged and cracked with twenty years of age. There are the names: Jimmy, Sean and D-A. Forever.
3) 0) text: Forty years old. Sitting at a small desk surrounded by shelved stock: cigarettes, corn flakes, soda... Going over some order sheets, Jimmy's lost in thought. Different from when he was a kid, this is a 1,000 yard stare. Beyond, through a half-open curtain, a CASH REGISTER RINGS, a couple kids working behind the counter. One of the clerks, PETE, 21, steps into the back.
3) 3) dialog: What do you want now, Pete?
3) 5) dialog: So?
3) 9) dialog: Don't be out late. It's your sister's first communion tomorrow. Christ, I sound like, I don't know...
3) 13) dialog: Later...
9) 0) text: Jimmy looks tough even when he's sleeping. His wife ANNABETH snoozes beside him. The bedside clock reads: 6:02. The PHONE starts to RING. Jimmy answers, bleary.
9) 1) dialog: Yeah?
9) 3) dialog: You and Katie can't handle six, how you going to handle eight when the first church crowd comes in?
9) 5) dialog: No? Hold on. Jimmy rolls to his feet. MOVE WITH him as he walks down...
9) 8) dialog: I'll be there in ten minutes, Pete. Call Sal and see if he can make it by eight instead of ten. 15.
10) 0) text: Jimmy pulls on his clothes. Annabeth watches from bed.
10) 2) dialog: I'm sure she'll make it.
10) 4) dialog: What other day has she screwed up lately? Annabeth puts up her hands, doesn't want to fight.
10) 6) dialog: One hour. I'll still be back before anyone gets out of bed.
11) 0) text: Jimmy arrives to a morning rush. Folks coming off the night shift: Cops, nurses from St. Regina's and a few working girls, all coming off the same battlefield together. Pete looks up, smiles in relief as Jimmy takes up a position by the cash register and lottery machine. Jimmy punches out tickets, RINGS UP at the REGISTER. He also takes the phone off the wall behind him, dials.
11) 1) dialog: (into phone) Hey, Drew, it's Jimmy. Sorry to wake you, I'm looking for Katie.
11) 4) dialog: Okay, man, I'll track her down.
11) 6) dialog: Nineteen-year-old girls, Drew? Who could keep a tally?
13) 0) text: Jimmy pulls another pot of coffee from the brewer. Pete appears from out front.
13) 2) dialog: Fuck, Pete, smoke the whole pack. 17.
14) 0) text: The BELL RINGS. Jimmy looks up as Brendan Harris and his little brother Silent Ray enter. Ray carries his street hockey stick, a blankness living in his face. Brendan clocks Jimmy with a brief look of surprise before turning down an aisle. He talks to his brother with sign language. His brother's hands flying back answers.
14) 1) dialog: (frowns ) Help you, Brendan?
14) 3) dialog: Barry's. Next aisle over.
14) 5) dialog: What time's Sal getting here?
14) 15) dialog: Shoot.
14) 17) dialog: It's not hate, man. But come on, don't you find that mute little fucker a little spooky?
14) 20) dialog: No. Really?
14) 22) dialog: Here comes Sal. About fucking time, too...
17) 1) dialog: Stand with their other daughter, Sara. Look back to watch their daughter come up the aisle. As Nadine's about to pass them, Annabeth whispers: 22.
17) 3) dialog: What? As she continues to the altar, Jimmy looks back over his shoulder. Really hoping to see Katie arrive at the last minute. But she's not going to make it.
19) 0) text: As Nadine solemnly receives her first communion. Annabeth, near tears, leans into Jimmy, whispers in his ear.
21) 2) dialog: Baby!
21) 4) dialog: It's itching me and I'm not even wearing it. Jimmy looks over his shoulder, smiles at Annabeth and Sara. They beam back. A moment of perfect happiness, until... A state POLICE CRUISER SLAMS around the corner of Buckingham Avenue. Jimmy whips around, matches as it goes wide into the left lane of Roseclair, rear TIRE SLAPPING the median strip, SIREN SLICING the morning air. It's followed an instant later by a black unmarked, cutting the ninety-degree turn at forty miles an hour. Two more cop cars zip under the overpass, take the entrance road into Pen Park. Jimmy lowers Nadine to the ground. 25. And he knows, feels it in his blood with a sudden mean certainty, a sense of things falling miserably into place.
21) 5) dialog: Katie...
22) 0) text: Looks like a riot waiting room. Cops, in the bushes, cops at the sawhorses, cops everywhere. K-9 German shepherds being walked out of a van. The crowd of onlookers growing. Jimmy steps up, is spotted by ED DEVEAU who's opening a bag of M&Ms with his teeth. As a POLICE HELICOPTER BUZZES by.
22) 2) dialog: What's up, Ed?
22) 5) dialog: Just curious I guess. Jimmy spots the clot of cops around a car, moves laterally for a better view. He gets it, sees it's Katie's. Jimmy starts forward, pushes through one end of the sawhorse, is almost there before two cops block him. As they babble official speak...
22) 6) dialog: That's my daughter's cart
24) 0) text: Jimmy's there with three of the Savage brothers: NICK, VAL and Kevin. His brothers-in-law. Jail-yard stares and hair triggers. They shout across the barrier at the cops. 27.
24) 4) dialog: Val, ease up! Nick. Nickie. Take Kevin and go to Drew Pigeon's. Talk to his daughter and her friend. Katie was out with them last night.
24) 6) dialog: And hey, these girls are friends. Don't get hard on them, but get answers. As Nick and Kevin head off, Sean arrives, greeting Jimmy with as big a smile as he can muster.
24) 8) dialog: Is she in there, Sean?
24) 12) dialog: That's my daughter's car. 28.
24) 14) dialog: (panic rising) My daughter's car. It's got blood in it. They brought fucking dogs in. Why do you got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?
24) 22) dialog: You still got those bolt cutters in your trunk?
26) 9) dialog: Sean! Look at me, Sean! Sean looks back at him. Jimmy arches up under the young cop's weight. Another cop helps hold him.
26) 10) dialog: You find her? Is it her? Is it? Sean is motionless. He holds Jimmy's eyes with his own, locking them until Jimmy's surging stare sees what Sean has just seen. And he knows it's over, his worst fear realized. And Jimmy screams. Love and rage in equal quantities. It shreds the birds from the trees. It ECHOES into the Pen Channel. Ropes of spit shoot from his mouth. Screaming. Sean turns away, looks back in at Katie. It's awful.
27) 0) text: Jimmy sits in a straight-back wooden chair. Waiting, head back, hands folded. He looks up at FOOTSTEPS. Annabeth is shown in by a young officer. Jimmy rises. She's still wearing her lavender dress from the communion. She steps into his arms, presses her face into his chest.
27) 2) dialog: What do you mean, baby? 32.
27) 5) dialog: Please what, honey? What?
28) 0) text: PUSH IN ON Katie. She lies on a metal table. Her eyes are closed and she's missing a shoe. Jimmy enters from the other way. Sean a step behind him. Jimmy stops short, opens his mouth to speak, but nothing comes out. Sean puts a hand on the small of his back.
28) 1) dialog: Yeah, that's her. That's Katie. That's my daughter.
29) 0) text: Sean sits across from Jimmy and Annabeth. A beat of surreal silence before Whitey arrives with four coffees.
29) 3) dialog: You ever think how one choice can change your life? (MORE )
29) 5) dialog: I heard Hitler's mother almost aborted him but bailed at the last minute. You know?
29) 7) dialog: Say you or me got in that car instead of Dave Boyle.
29) 10) dialog: If I'd got in that car, life would be a different thing. My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother? She was beautiful. Regal. You know the way some Latin women can be? And she knew it. You had to have balls to even go near her. And I did. Eighteen years old, the two of us, and she was carrying Katie. Here's the thing, Sean, if I had gotten in that car, I most likely would've ended up a basket case. I never would have had the juice to ask out Marita and we never would've had Katie. And Katie, then, would never have been murdered. You see what I'm saying?
29) 22) dialog: No. Go ahead.
29) 24) dialog: Yes and no. I was mostly in back.
29) 26) dialog: No. She was herself. She was happy. She --
29) 28) dialog: No, nothing. 35.
29) 30) dialog: When she was little, right after her mother had died, I had just gotten out of prison and I could never leave her alone. Whether she ended up crying or not, she'd get this look. Like she was preparing to never see you again. For a few seconds on Saturday, she looked at me that way. Whitey starts to write this down. His shock
29) 31) dialog: Hey, it was just a look.
29) 34) dialog: Sixteen years ago. Two years at Deer Island for robbery. Is that going to help you catch my daughter's killer? I mean, I'm just asking. dissolving, Jimmy stares hard at Whitey.
29) 36) dialog: The point.
29) 38) dialog: Um, this kid... No, that was this morning. 36.
29) 40) dialog: Neighborhood, kid, Brendan Harris, came in this morning, asked if Katie was around, like he expected to see her. But they barely knew each other.
29) 42) dialog: No.
29) 44) dialog: Hey, Sean, what the fuck? You're going to grill me? A father knows.
29) 47) dialog: I'll answer everything you got tomorrow, but we got to go. We got two girls waiting at home wondering where their sister is.
31) 0) text: Two uniformed TROOPERS search. Under the mattress, through drawers. We hear GIRLS CRYING in the next room. They look up, embarrassed, as Jimmy looks in.
31) 1) dialog: You guys almost done?
31) 3) dialog: Find anything?
31) 5) dialog: No. No I didn't. As the troopers go back to work and Jimmy walks away...
32) 0) text: Storefronts shut down across the street. A rumbling stillness has taken over the area. Jimmy steps out on the porch of his three-decker. He sits on the steps. Closing his eyes, he leans back, listens, as the tears of ANNABETH AND HIS DAUGHTERS drift down.
32) 3) dialog: Hey, Dave.
32) 5) dialog: It's okay.
32) 7) dialog: Appreciate it, Dave. A moment. Dave manages a little smile, a wave.
32) 9) dialog: Dave... Dave stops, looks back hopefully.
32) 10) dialog: You know how it is. Irish family. Catholics. How it'll be tomorrow.
32) 12) dialog: Yeah. All Annabeth has are those ham- fisted brothers of hers. If Celeste could come over and give her a hand...
34) 0) text: Annabeth and Celeste at the stove, cooking bacon and eggs. Neither talks, but they're happy for each other's company. A HUBBUB of VOICES from the hallway, up which Jimmy walks. Jimmy trades smiles with Celeste, then looks at Annabeth.
34) 1) dialog: You need anything, baby? I can work the stove a bit. Annabeth shakes her head, but doesn't look at him.
34) 5) dialog: Look at me.
34) 7) dialog: Okay, baby, okay.
36) 0) text: A throng already gathered. Celeste comes out to fill coffee cups. She looks across the room at Dave who's sandwiched between some of the Savage brothers. He sees her, smiles wanly. Very out of his element. And Celeste can feel his aloneness. As she smiles back... The DOORBELL RINGS. Jimmy gets it. It's his father-in- law, THEO SAVAGE, a case of beer on each shoulder.
36) 2) dialog: Theo. Jimmy takes one of the cases, as Theo steps inside.
36) 4) dialog: She's trying, Theo.
37) 0) text: Jimmy shakes a bag of ice into a beer cooler; Theo watches.
37) 2) dialog: Hasn't really sunk in, Theo.
37) 5) dialog: Domestic responsibilities?
37) 7) dialog: You figured that might slip my mind, Theo?
37) 9) dialog: Like they put her in a bag.
37) 11) dialog: That's what Katie looked like when I saw her in the morgue. Like someone put her in a bag and then had beaten the bag with pipes.
37) 13) dialog: Janey died in her sleep. All due respect and shit, but there you go. She went to bed and never woke up. Peaceful.
37) 15) dialog: My daughter though? Someone put a gun to her. She was murdered. And right about now they'll be starting the autopsy. Laying out scalpels and chest spreaders. And you want to talk to me about my domestic fucking responsibilities? Theo looks down, shuts up finally. 45.
39) 0) text: Jimmy sits on the deck. Sits by himself under the clothesline stretched across the porch. Sits beneath the flapping clothes. The sounds of the WAKE drift out as he stares up at the sky. Dave steps out. Unaware of Jimmy, he steps to the rail, lights a cigarette.
39) 1) dialog: Hey, Dave.
39) 3) dialog: No, no, man. Sit down. Dave sits down alongside Jimmy, backs to the siding.
39) 4) dialog: I haven't had a chance to talk to you all day. How you doing? 47.
39) 6) dialog: What happened to your hand?
39) 9) dialog: It's good to see you, man.
39) 11) dialog: How are our girls holding up?
39) 13) dialog: Celeste is a godsend. Thank her for me, okay? Dave nods. They sit there in silence a moment.
39) 14) dialog: It's nice. Just sitting here.
39) 16) dialog: I couldn't take it anymore. Trying to find room in the fridge for all the food we're going to be throwing out in a few days. 48.
39) 18) dialog: But I can't let the things that happen the next few days get fucked up. Because then that's all anyone'll remember about her. Because, Katie, man, one thing you could say about her since she was little, that girl was neat. Dave looks like he's going to cry out of sympathy.
39) 19) dialog: That first night out of the joint, after Marita died, I was more afraid of my little daughter than I ever was of being in prison. Fuck... Dave looks pained as the tears roll down Jimmy's cheeks.
39) 20) dialog: I loved her the most, because when we sat in the kitchen that first night, we were the last two people on Earth. Forgotten and unwanted. And, Dave, I swear, it's starting to piss me off. I haven't cried yet for her. My own daughter and I can't even cry. Fuck...
39) 22) dialog: Yeah?
39) 24) dialog: (realizing) ) Damn...
39) 26) dialog: No, Dave. Just sit here a minute if that's cool.
41) 0) text: It's quiet. Sounds like the crowd is gone. Celeste tidies in the kitchen. Busy work really. Wiping down the toaster, wiping down already clean counters. I'd rather be here than home work. 52. Jimmy enters, is surprised to see her.
41) 1) dialog: Celeste. Celeste jumps, nearly shouts out.
41) 3) dialog: What are you still doing here?
41) 4) dialog: (nodding) I convinced her to take a pill. Girls are asleep, too. Jimmy's in here for a reason. He pours himself a shot of whiskey. Celeste watches him. With a wry smile.
41) 6) dialog: For the road. Then home.
41) 8) dialog: No. You've done enough. Jimmy hands her her shot, raises his.
41) 9) dialog: To you and Dave. For being here for us. They knock back their shots. Celeste sets her glass down.
41) 11) dialog: Good night. As she heads out, Jimmy picks up the bottle. About to pour another shot, decides not to. As he screws the cap back on -- 53.
42) 0) text: Sean sits on the sofa looking through a shoe box of old photos. Mostly him and his wife, Lauren. But there's an older, thicker Polaroid: him, Jimmy and Dave when they were kids. As he stares, BLEED IN the sound of KIDS LAUGHING, the sound of a CAR ROLLING, STOPPING. The PHONE RINGS.
44) 0) text: Jimmy sits under the clothesline, a pillow in his hand. As he breathes it in and out, we PAN OFF him to... The neighborhood spread out at night. Lights twinkle. Sounds are muted. And in the distance, the Mystic River flows. And over it, we hear:
44) 2) dialog: I know in my soul I contributed to your death. I can feel it. But I don't know how.
47) 0) text: Jimmy gets out of his car, walks around and pops the trunk. He pulls out a dress wrapped in plastic film. As he heads for the entrance... 63.
48) 0) text: One of the "SONS" sits across the desk from Jimmy. The dress is draped over the chair beside him. The Son fills out a form with a gold pen. Jimmy looks far away.
48) 2) dialog: Yeah, that's fine.
48) 4) dialog: I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.
48) 6) dialog: The notice?
48) 9) dialog: (looks over) Where is she?
48) 11) dialog: My daughter.
48) 13) dialog: I'd like to see her. 64. The Son blinks back at Jimmy, looks a little unnerved.
49) 0) text: lying on a stainless steel table, a sheet pulled up under her chin. Her hair clean and combed, her face dusted with makeup. Eyes closed, but no longer clenched tight. The Son stands in the doorway, shifting nervously as Jimmy steps up, stands over his daughter. Jimmy gets down on his haunches, his eyes even with Katie's face. He rests his chin on his forearm, looks at his daughter a long moment. Finally, softly, gently:
49) 1) dialog: I'm going to kill him, Katie. I'm going to find him before the police do and I'm going to kill him.
49) 3) dialog: The notice. It should read: ‘Katherine Marcus, beloved daughter of James and Marita, deceased, stepdaughter of Annabeth, and sister to Sara and Nadine. As the gold pen flies in the Son's hand...
53) 1) dialog: Bullshit. He's sitting at the kitchen table with Annabeth and across from Sean and Whitey.
53) 5) dialog: Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?
53) 7) dialog: You're a hundred percent positive?
53) 9) dialog: Fuck...
53) 11) dialog: I knew his father. They called him ‘Just Ray.'
53) 13) dialog: There were so many guys named Ray in the neighborhood. Crazy Ray Bucheck, Psycho Ray Dorian. Ray Harris got stuck with Just Ray because all the cool nicknames had been taken. (big sigh) Anyhow, we never got along too good. I flat-out didn't like him. (MORE )
53) 15) dialog: And then he cut out on his wife when she was pregnant with that mute kidof hers so, I don't know, I figure theapple doesn't fall far from the tree and I don't want Brendan or any other Harris seeing Katie or any other daughter I got. (laughs) I don't believe we're talking about Just Ray Harris.
53) 17) dialog: So?
53) 19) dialog: Some people won't talk to the police.
53) 21) dialog: How long?
53) 23) dialog: How long would you say till you put Katie's killer in jail? I need to know.
53) 25) dialog: Bargaining?
53) 27) dialog: Find her killer, Sergeant. I'm not standing in your way.
61) 0) text: Jimmy sits on the front porch, thinking. He looks up at someone walking down the sidewalk. It's Dave.
61) 2) dialog: You're out late.
61) 5) dialog: I guess... I started sitting out here the last few years. Waiting for Katie to come home, you know? It would get to be midnight and I'd tell Annabeth 'I think I'll go sit on the porch for awhile. Weird thing was, it always seemed to bring her home. sit out there for a beat.
61) 7) dialog: Hmm?
61) 9) dialog: You saw Katie Saturday night?
61) 11) dialog: You talk to her?
61) 13) dialog: (disappointed) Oh...
61) 16) dialog: Yeah... 81. Dave continues on his way.
64) 0) text: Jimmy walks down a row of headstones, the SALESMAN a respectful two steps behind.
64) 2) dialog: That one.
64) 6) dialog: Thanks, man. Jimmy taps his fist into Val's. Val taps back.
64) 8) dialog: I know.
64) 10) dialog: I know, man. What's up?
64) 12) dialog: What about just Ray's kid? You find out anything there?
64) 15) text: No, no, Val. Hold off for the time being. Anything else? Val hesitates, holding something back. Val waits Jimmy's eyes narrow, then he looks out at the cemetery beyond.
64) 16) dialog: What?
64) 18) dialog: You want to spit something. What is it?
64) 20) dialog: Dave was at McGill's that night. They probably questioned him like everyone else. a beat. That's not it.
64) 22) dialog: Yeah?
64) 24) dialog: Probably forgot to ask him something.
67) 0) text: Celeste. Pacing the sidewalk up from Jimmy's house. She stops, watches as Val's car pulls up and he and Jimmy get out. As they near the front steps, she hurries forward.
67) 4) dialog: Sure. (to Val) Catch up with you in a minute. 93. Celeste manages a smile back as Val disappears inside.
67) 5) dialog: Here. Step into my office. Jimmy sits on the porch steps. She sits beside him. Jimmy watches her a moment, waiting. But she's all bottled up.
67) 6) dialog: Beautiful day, huh? That's almost enough to send her over. Her lip trembles. She turns her head away to wipe a tear.
67) 7) dialog: Whatever it is, Celeste. It's okay.
67) 9) dialog: Okay...
67) 11) dialog: (monotone) You left Dave.
67) 14) dialog: I know he was taken by the cops this morning. I know he saw Katie the night she died, but didn't tell me till after the police had questioned him about it. I know his hand looks like he's been punching a wall with it. (beat) Anything else I should know?
67) 17) dialog: What did he say happened?
67) 19) dialog: Celeste.
67) 21) dialog: Do you think Dave killed Katie? Celeste looks about. Finally, unable to verbally form the damning response, she finally just nods her head. Yes.
71) 11) dialog: How's it going? 102.
71) 13) dialog: To our children. They down the shots. Jimmy immediately pours another round.
71) 15) dialog: Yeah. No one bothers you.
71) 19) dialog: Yeah?
73) 0) text: Dave's having trouble focusing. Jimmy and Val seem like they've forgotten he's here.
73) 2) dialog: Sure. Good old Ray.
73) 5) dialog: You all right? 104. Dave holds up a hand as it surges up inside him.
73) 7) dialog: Dave?
75) 0) text: Out back. One light over the door. And we're TRACKING BACK WITH Dave as he stumbles through the weeds. Drops to his hands and knees at the edge of the Mystic River. We're BACK BEHIND as he heaves, empties his stomach into the dirty water. Finally, he lurches to his feet, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. He takes a few deep breaths, feels better. And when Dave finally turns around, Jimmy and Val are standing there. One on either side of the door, the light bulb burning between them. Dave grins. 106.
77) 0) text: Jimmy puts his arm around Dave's shoulder, leads him along the river. Val walks a few paces behind.
77) 1) dialog: Let me tell you about Ray Harris. He was a buddy of mine. Used to visit me in prison. Used to check up on Marita and Katie and my mother and see if they needed anything. But he also put me in prison. He ratted me off.
77) 3) dialog: My wife had cancer.
77) 5) dialog: Ray Harris robbed me of being with her. I know we all die alone, but I could have helped her with the dying. Not the death, but the dying. You see what I'm saying? ‘Dave takes a half step away, faces Jimmy.
77) 7) dialog: I made Ray kneel down right over there and I shot him twice. Once in the chest, once in the throat. We were both crying when I did it.
77) 9) dialog: Ray begged. Pregnant wife. Little Brendan. Said he knew me. Said I was a good man... How about you, Dave? Do you think I'm a good man?
77) 11) dialog: As I sunk Ray in the river, I could feel God watching me. Shaking his head. Not mad, just, I guess the way you'd get when a puppy shits on your rug.
77) 13) dialog: Don't talk, Dave. Panic rising, Dave sees Val holds a gun in his hand.
77) 15) dialog: Is this the mugger story? 110.
77) 19) dialog: Of course, Dave, sure. You killed a child molester.
77) 21) dialog: Oh, the molested kid helped you?
77) 23) dialog: No what? You said you and a boy.
77) 27) dialog: Your wife thinks you killed Katie. And you'd rather have her believe that than, what, you killed a child molester? Most people really don't mind when a child molester dies, Dave. Why didn't you just tell Celeste the truth? 111.
77) 29) dialog: And I didn't hear of any dead guys being found lately.
77) 32) dialog: Shut up, Val... (to Dave) Katie was nineteen. You know? Nineteen and she never did nothing to you. Why'd you kill her?
77) 37) dialog: I'm looking, Dave. I'm looking.
77) 40) dialog: Why'd you do it? 112. FLASHBACK --— CELLAR Feet coming down. Young Dave burying his face in the rags. Young Dave pounding on the bulkhead.
77) 44) dialog: Make them right now. Start now. Admit what you did.
77) 46) dialog: Yeah. Good. Right after you do your time. I did mine. Do yours. Admit what you did.
77) 48) dialog: One more time about the boy and I will open you up. Jimmy holds a wicked-looking buck knife. Dave dry heaves. Jimmy nearly does himself. Even Val looks confused as Jimmy blinks out toward the river.
77) 49) dialog: I thought I was done. I thought I had left killing people and dumping them in the river behind. (turns to Dave) Admit what you did and you'll live. Say it out loud and you'll breathe. You'll go to jail, but I will give you your life. Finally, Dave decides it's a way to save his life, maybe even a way to ease Jimmy's grief. 113.
77) 51) dialog: Why...
77) 53) dialog: What dream?
77) 55) dialog: So it was the dream, then?
77) 57) dialog: (hardens ) But I didn't get in the car, Dave. You did. We're CLOSE ON them. And then Dave gets a funny look on his face. A funny face and then he looks down. Looks down in time to see Jimmy's hand pulling the knife back from his guts. Blood gushes down onto Dave's jeans.

All except for one who's lost, sad, haunted. The child's eyes find Sean's for just an instant and then he's gone.
