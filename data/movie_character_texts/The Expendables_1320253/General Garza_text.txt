A CEILING FAN overhead is barely spinning at two revolution per minute. An UNSHAVEN CUSTOMS AGENT eyes the CLOSE-UP of the men’s PASSPORTS.

TWO MILITARY JEEPS followed by an open back MILITARY TRUCK crammed with 20 H CORE SOLDIERS rumble along the narrow main street. These SOLDIERS wear the DARK RED BERETS signifying that they ar part of GARZA’S BRUTAL ELITE TROOPS. The country’s new FLAG (an image of GENERAL GARZA) flies the corners of the hoods of all the vehicles. Though slig obscured, we see BARNEY and CHRISTMAS pass into view. The depressed, intimidated LOCALS listlessly move aside a the CONVOY approaches. THE TWO ARMY JEEPS begin blasting their horns. People mov aside. BARNEY and CHRISTMAS observe FOUR AMERICAN OPERATIVES, dressed in khaki as they pass into view in the LEAD JEEP. They then observe the SECOND JEEP in which PAINE is drivi and riding shotgun is MONROE with his slicked back hair a pair of aviator glasses, who exudes power, and menace. BARNEY and CHRISTMAS eye the men as they pass directly in front of their observation point. Christmas starts filmin them with a converted still camera.

Standing beneath GARZA’S quarters are THIRTY FIVE RED BER with their faces painted in a fearsome design. They are i SEMI-CIRCLE. MONROE and PAINE eye one another, as they try to mentally compute the surreal and unnerving sight. GENERAL GARZA’S outline standing on the balcony. Cigar sm drifts like a ghost in the dead night air.
