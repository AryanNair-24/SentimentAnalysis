1) 21) dialog: (smiling) Let's say I took the bows for a team of brrlliant associates.
1) 26) text: Sir Ian, in typical English underplay fashion, comments:
1) 27) dialog: Bit on the fanciful side, isn't it, Sir?
7) 12) dialog: Thank you. One of the seamen leads the way out bulkhead door to the wardroom.
21) 0) text: Present besides the seamen are the Skipper, Dave, Dr. Kent and Sir Ian.  The scene is bedlam - the Sonar is screaming weirdly, the SHATTERING CRASHES are repeated over and over, and the scene JUMPS WILDLY.  Dave points at the view screen, yells:
21) 2) dialog: (murmurs) Incredible!  Absolutely! Kent's jaw sets tensely.
21) 8) dialog: (drily) The end of the world! Wendover spreads his hands helplessly.  Kent is still frowning at the view screen.
21) 10) dialog: (incredulous) Under water?
22) 6) dialog: It is rather fantastic - Sir Ian hesitates.  Then, from beside his chair, he picks up a large, rolled chart.  He unties the string binding it.
22) 7) dialog: Here is a chart of the Arctic region.  On it I have plotted every instance of these strange phenomena - sinkings, electrical storms, our own experiences... He unrolls the chart on the table top.  Reef and Wendover exchange a perplexed look.  Then they get up, come around peer down over Sir Ian's shoulder at the chart.  Sir Ian, with a pencil, gestures on the chart.
22) 9) dialog: Here was where we encountered the electrical storm...The Sturgeon was lost just about this area. Others...here, here, and here...
22) 10) text: As Sir Ian looks up from the chart, demands:
22) 11) dialog: Do you see it?
22) 16) dialog: The pattern. (tapping the chart repeatedly) Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
22) 18) dialog: (continuing) ...about the North Pole.
22) 21) dialog: (significantly) I cannot accept the idea that these phenomena were either random, or natural. (a break) I believe they are motivated by... some sort of intelligence! The others react, Wendover and Reef exchange a look, then Wendover explodes angrily:
22) 23) dialog: I did not mean to imply, neces- sarily, a 'human' intelligence.
22) 28) dialog: Perhaps not 'on earth' at all. Perhaps it comes from beyond the earth!
22) 34) dialog: I've been thinking about that. (tapping the chart) These appearances of...whatever we're dealing with...make almost a complete ring around the Pole. But there is what may be a signifi- cant gap, or break, in the ring...
22) 36) dialog: ...right here...the Queen Victoria Sea area, near Franz Joseph Land...
22) 39) text: As Sir Ian looks up from the chart, but Captain Wendover continues to study it absorbedly.
22) 40) dialog: (continuing) ...above Murmansk, and Finland.
22) 42) dialog: What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ? Wendover frowns, intrigued by the possibility.  Wen- dover beckons Reef over to the chart:
23) 8) dialog: (picking it up) ...the critical point - if we're on the right track.
25) 1) text: Carl, Sir Ian and Dr. Kent.
27) 7) dialog: (wryly) I'll be another!
27) 17) dialog: (a thoughtful murmur) Directly towards the Pole! They look at him, trying to fathom his thoughts.
29) 2) dialog: ...a pure oval shape, with this cyclops-like eye, or turret, on top.  I'd estimate its diameter at 300 feet.  No discernible ori- fices...
29) 4) dialog: 'The Eye of Cyclops..!'
29) 9) dialog: Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer. (to the group) 'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
29) 24) dialog: This would explain why there were never any reports of land- ings.  It's possible that who- ever - or whatever - inhabits the craft is not a land creature, but a form of marine life.
29) 36) dialog: (an absent murmur) Or, perhaps, until he gets us? A look passes among them; that possibility is by no means remote.
30) 6) dialog: We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
30) 10) dialog: We harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a super scale....
30) 17) dialog: That may be over-simplifying, but--- He doesn't finish the sentence, obviously implying that Reef's conclusion agrees with their own.
30) 19) text: as Sir Ian picks up Kent's thought:
30) 20) dialog: ....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it.... (a nod toward Reef) ...'recharging his batteries'?
30) 26) dialog: (frowns, puzzled) 'Bushwack?'
32) 1) dialog: Dave is working over his navigation chart. The tension in the Con is electric.  Dave takes a compass, swings a pair of arcs on the chart, looks up to announce:
54) 0) text: Present are Wendover, Carl, Reef, Kent, Sir Ian and Dave. This is a grim, hopeless conclave.  The silence, except for a faint trickle of water somewhere, is complete, eerie, ghastly.  Faces are bathed in tense perspiration. Wendover shakes his head.
54) 8) dialog: That's all very fine, young man. But how would one go about get- ting inside Cyclops? Reef takes a deep breath, throws a glance at Carl, then says:
56) 1) dialog: And now Griff's voice comes over the intercom:
63) 1) dialog: The Skipper himself wears the headphones.  He cries ex- citedly into the radio mike:
63) 8) dialog: (ever the scientist) What is it like, inside Cyclops? This is a priceless opportunity for.... But Wendover ignores this, admonishes:
63) 18) dialog: But that's impossible!
63) 23) dialog: (suddenly fearful, to Wendover) What direction does the system indicate?
63) 25) dialog: (grave, thoughtful) Toward the Pole!
68) 3) dialog: (murmurs thought- fully) As we near the Pole...
68) 5) dialog: (mildly) There is. (as they study him) I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life! A grim reaction, all around.
80) 0) text: As Griff superintends preparations to open the lock door, the men from the control room - Wendover, Kent and Sir Ian, hasten in.  Now Griff cracks the hatch on the lock door, and in a moment, Reef staggers out, then helps Carl from the Explorer.  Wendover frowns, glances inside:
82) 14) dialog: (a glance at Reef) Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
83) 6) dialog: All ready?
