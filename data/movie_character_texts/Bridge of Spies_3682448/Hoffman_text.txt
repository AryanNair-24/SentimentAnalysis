1) 523) dialog: Yeah, complicated. The Soviet side has been setting up checkpoints for the past few months to try to stop people hemorrhaging to the Western sectors. It hasn’t worked. We have intelligence to suggest that they May go one step further and wall off the entire Eastern sector. Donovan is concerned, thinking...
1) 573) dialog: Mr. Michener here is your Berlin escort. He’s an attaché with the US Embassy. He refers to the State Department man in the front passen seat. The driver is someone with an extremely thick neck fleshy ears. Michener has his arm hooked around the seat to talk back.
1) 598) dialog: Don’t fall for that. We can get him out another time. Powers is the whole ballgame. The sedan pulls up to a remote looking house - a safe hou 12.17.14 FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 63.
1) 601) dialog: I‘ll be staying at the Hilton. It’s not far. He hands Donovan a slip of paper.
1) 602) dialog: This is a number here in West Berlin. Memorize it, and give it back to me. Donovan puts it in his shirt pocket.
1) 603) dialog: No. I mean now. Donovan sighs, looks at the paper.
1) 604) dialog: The Soviets keep cutting international lines, but local calls are okay. Someone will pick up day and night. Donovan hands the piece of paper back. Hoffman takes out lighter, burns the paper and drops it into an ashtray.
1) 605) dialog: (holding up Donovan's passport) Now this docket, attached to your passport, will serve as your ticket into and out of the Eastern Soviet sector. The meeting with Vogel is set for noon tomorrow. He unfolds a map on the table.
1) 606) dialog: There are only a few routes left to the East. You take the S-Bahn, the station we showed you on the way in. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
1) 609) dialog: You're going to get off at the Friedrichstrasse Station, here, and walk to the Soviet Embassy on Unter den Linden, here. Look at the map now -- you shouldn’t take it with you. You're looking at a map, you're an American, you’re a spy, you could well be detained. Just avoid interaction with people, generally -- you don’t belong, so don’t stick out. Food is scarce over there and things have started to fall apart. There are gangs; rule of law is less...firmly established over there. And definitely stay away from the Wall. On their side, there’s a line cleared of buildings, along the Wall, they call it the Death Line. Cross it and you'll be shot.
1) 611) dialog: Don’t worry too much about what Michener said.
1) 613) dialog: Twenty-five, why?
1) 615) dialog: Who?
1) 740) dialog: “Schischkin”? He’s not an embassy secretary. Ivan Schischkin is the KGB’s chief in Western Europe.
1) 742) dialog: How did you lose your coat?
1) 746) dialog: I’1ll get you another coat.
1) 748) dialog: Him we don’t know. He might be what you said he is, friend of the Attorney General. Just some guy the GDR tapped to handle this. Sounds like the East Germans are fighting for a place at our table. The GDR gets Abel back for the Russians, winning their respect, and captures the headlines for their cause. Which of course puts East Germany on the map. But we don’t care about their map. Stick with the Russians. Stick with the Russians. It’s Powers for Abel.
1) 750) dialog: That's what you seem to be telling me. We’ll put Abel on a plane, he’ll be here Friday. So if Schischkin gets the okay, all that’s left is the mechanics of the trade, how we swap our guy for their guy.
1) 752) dialog: No! Don’t go bleeding heart on me! Powers is the whole ballgame. Forget this Ivy League boy, who obviously thought it was a good idea to study Soviet economics in Berlin in the middle of the Cold War. Powers is who we need.
1) 879) dialog: You shouldn’t be here.
1) 883) dialog: What happened? Where were you last night?
1) 885) dialog: Jesus.
1) 887) dialog: Great. Good. So the Soviets are set. We get Powers. We get Powers. Well done. He gives a thumbs up to Michener and Pinker, sitting at a table nearby.
1) 889) dialog: Sure, that’s why we tried. Abel’s on his way, so we're all set for tomorrow morning.
1) 891) dialog: Makes things simple.
1) 893) dialog: Yeah, I understand. We’re set. We can ignore the message we got this morning. (CONTINUED)
1) 896) dialog: From from the East Germans. They called the number I gave you, said they wanted to speak to you today.
1) 898) dialog: No. Office of Harald Ott. East German attorney general.
1) 900) dialog: To talk to you, but -- it’s okay, I can’t ask you to go back there. Listen, you seem to be persona non grata to some elements. We won’t push our luck.
1) 902) dialog: No no no, now listen, you don’t need to go -- in fact, you shouldn't go. In fact you can’t go. We’re set with the Soviets, we don’t want to screw it up.
1) 904) dialog: You're not going, don’t be a pain in the ass.
1) 957) dialog: You're kidding me. You’re kidding me. You're kidding me. (CONTINUED)
1) 961) dialog: (pulling into his pocket for change) That’s exactly what you weren’t supposed to do.
1) 963) dialog: (explosive) Your instructions were to get Powers! Not Pryor!! That was not the original deal! You fouled it all up.
1) 965) dialog: You fucked it all up!
1) 967) dialog: How do you know?! You don’t know that! Hoffman is still staring at him, anger fading as he diges the implications. He looks around at where they are and h public it is. Donovan drops in the coins, in broken Germa places a long distance call to New York.
1) 971) dialog: What if they think about it, say forget it, you keep our guy, we'll keep your guys?
1) 974) dialog: We’re on. Two for one.
1) 976) dialog: One wrinkle.
1) 980) dialog: They won’t release Pryor with Powers. Not at the bridge. They'll release him at the same time -- when the Russians give us Powers on the bridge, they'll release Pryor over at Checkpoint Charlie.
1) 983) dialog: I think it means, “We wanna have the last word.”
1) 985) dialog: You tell me. You felt ‘em out.
1) 989) dialog: (looking through binoculars) Nobody’s late. We’re early.
1) 994) dialog: Yeah.
1) 996) dialog: I’m sure they do.
1) 998) dialog: Because we have snipers. Hoffman swings to the buildings on our side of the bridge revealing our snipers. For the first time Donovan feels t extent to which he is out of his depth, not in control. Engine noise nearby: two cars approaching, from our side. They pull up. Avalon emerges, walks to opposite side passenger door and opens it.
1) 1017) dialog: Looks like our party. A beat as the small figures on the opposite side sort themselves out, survey our side. The two parties gazing at each other. Schischkin and another man start walking Powers toward th middle of the bridge.
1) 1018) dialog: Well. Let’s go. You can stay here, Donovan.
1) 1044) dialog: Okay, let’s go. Pryor’ll show up, or he won't; let’s go.
1) 1048) dialog: I don’t give a shit what they want, we have our objective. Go ahead Abel. Go ahead sir, you can go.
1) 1054) dialog: Doesn't matter what he wants, sir, I’m in charge and you are free to go. Please go. Walk across. Abel is looking at Donovan.
1) 1068) dialog: Go. Go. Go. The men move off, all but Donovan who stands facing the o side. He and Abel regard each other from across the gap, Schischken helps - or steers? - Abel into the back seat o his car. Not friendly, not unfriendly. The floodlights go out as Donovan stands there, watching car with Abel pull away.
1) 1074) dialog: (curt) Yeah.
