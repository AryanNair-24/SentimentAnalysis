(pauses ) But the next day, when we were attacked - when she died - I lost all that. I was suddenly ina different world. Of pain and fear. Anger. (holding back her tears) I felt guilty. All of the time. Why did I live when she died? How do I face my parents now? But most of all, I couldn’t understand why someone would want to kill us. (beat) (MORE )
