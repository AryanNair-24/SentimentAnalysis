MT EDEN ROAD/RICKY’S CAR - DAY 47 Ricky’s car drives through the centre of Mt Eden, towards the grassy cone of the volcano towering above. A sign reads MT EDEN SUMMIT. Ricky’s car follows the road up towards Mt Eden. Ricky drives, the twins crammed into the car with him. Craggy trees line the road like a tunnel of gnarled talons, sunlight filtering through in eerie shafts. Rachel’s eyes widen — A DARK FIGURE can be glimpsed between the trunks, still as a statue, as if watching the car. Rachel looks back — the figure is gone, hidden by the trees.

45) 10) dialog: Theo, this is ... this is crazy. The room fills with a warm firelight. The light emanates from the palm of Mr Jones’s hand. It spreads up Rachel’s arm — where it begins to warm the grey of Mr Wilberforce’s touch. Ricky’s mouth falls open.
45) 11) dialog: Or maybe it’s just me. Mr Jones's brow furrows. He grips Rachel’s arm tightly. The fire whispers around her neck then flickers, weakening. The wound on Rachel’s skin pales, fades ... the flesh KNOTTING into a bloom of SCAR TISSUE. (CONTINUED)
