Rachel looks up to find she’s nearing the Wilberforce house. Dead trees frame the house, skeletal fingers reaching out across the water. Seen from the lake through leafless branches and tangled vines, the Wilberforce house is dark and tumbledown, weatherboards thick with moss, roof rotten and sunken-in, windows dark. No signs of life. CREEAAK! The back door opens, just a crack. Something moves in the darkness beyond. Rachel's eyes widen ... then she squeals as a branch snags her hair. INT.

Ricky’s car follows the road up towards Mt Eden. Ricky drives, the twins crammed into the car with him. Craggy trees line the road like a tunnel of gnarled talons, sunlight filtering through in eerie shafts. Rachel’s eyes widen — A DARK FIGURE can be glimpsed between the trunks, still as a statue, as if watching the car. Rachel looks back — the figure is gone, hidden by the trees.

A figure sits, silhouetted on the edge, facing Rangitoto. Mr Jones is barely older than when we last saw him, but he seems a shadow of his former self: beaten, the fire has died in his eyes. He stares across at the black island opposite. A warm glow of FIRELIGHT dances on his face, emanating from his hands. Theo approaches the old man from behind. A flicker of FLAME in his hands. Theo peers closer, intrigued. As Theo steps up Jones closes his hands, the fire disappears. He stuffs whatever made the fire into the pockets of his jacket. He turns to Theo, his eyes blazing with momentary interest. He looks up at Theo’s copper hair. Theo raises a hand to his hair involuntarily. The man seems to stare into him, read him, as if looking for an answer from him ... Theo turns and hurries on around the crater. As he goes the light in the old man’s eyes dies — as if he was searching for something and realised, with disappointment, it wasn’t to be found with Theo. (CONTINUED)

He turns towards the mountain, treading water. Theo jerks under — — then comes up spluttering. Rachel surfaces behind him and laughs.
33) 2) dialog: Bleeding skies. She GASPS suddenly, catching a glimpse of — A FIGURE, lurking in the trees above the rocks at the water’s edge. A Wilberforce DRONE. Chilled, Rachel swims strongly to the boat and hauls herself on board. She looks back towards the island — there’s no sign of the Drone now — Suddenly, Cliff’s fishing rod SCREAMS as the reel unwinds. He grabs the handle, reels furiously. The rod bends alarmingly.

35) 3) dialog: The same as at the lake. The twins reach the hearse. The back doors are closed. Something viscous drips from them onto the ground. Theo cups his hand against the back window to peer in. His breath fogs the glass. Something coats the inside, obscuring the view. He reaches for the door handle.
35) 4) dialog: Maybe we shouldn't ... Theo pulls the doors open. It opens with a SCHLUK, like a wound being pulled open. Stringy slime clings to the edges. The twins grimace in disgust as they see — The hearse interior is warped and gnarled, crusted with glistening layers of organic matter. (CONTINUED)

Everything grows with twisted organic matter — as if the house itself has formed out of gnarled scar tissue. The twins creep forward to look, taking it in with horror. Theo swings the torch slowly around. Vague remnants of wooden beams and doorways poke from the awful fleshiness. A sudden JOLT, as though someone just picked the house up and shook it — then a CLATTER as an EARTHQUAKE rolls through the house, its ancient weatherboards shifting and groaning. Dust sifts down from above. Silence. The twins look around, wide-eyed.

UPSTAIRS a fleshy WILBERFORCE TENTACLE twists around Rachel’s head and shoulder. Mr Wilberforce leans over her, his human visage sloughing off to reveal a fearsome creature beneath — Rachel looks up, SCREAMS IN FRIGHT — BELOW, Theo LEAPS, grabs for her legs, yanks — Rachel tumbles down through the hole and lands BELOW. The twins scramble to their feet and race for the open front door — From above come Wilberforce BARKS — BARKS answer from the doorway — as more WILBERFORCE DRONES come onto the porch!

The huge space — a football field in length — is gnarled with putrescent Wilberforce growth. The twins have fallen from the tunnel onto a raised rib that cuts through a sea of slime to another tunnel opening in the far wall of the chamber. But dominating the space is a CREATURE. The kids’ mouths fall open as they take in a vast supertanker of flesh —a horrible wall of skin and scales, a writhing suggestion of mighty tentacles. A massive slug-like creature wallows in the mire. Its form rises and falls in time with the rumble of its breathing. Rachel and Theo stare, dwarfed by its scale. The beast unfolds a great tentacle and shifts its almost unimaginable bulk. Great waves of flesh seem to roll past as it turns. The chamber shakes, churning up great waves of scum. The twins recoil, falling to their feet. The beast opens a ghastly maw and expels a roar of septic air. The twins cover their noses and mouths.
70) 4) dialog: How are we supposed to fight that? Behind them the tunnel ‘swallows’ — a rush of air sucking back up into it. (CONTINUED)
72) 4) dialog: It doesn't make sense. A tunnel’s got to go somewhere. Rachel looks up — Above is the closed fist of a tunnel entrance. She stretches to push her hand up through the fleshy valve with a vile SQUELCH. She withdraws her hand and touches a fingertip to her lips.
72) 5) dialog: Salt water. Barks echo from behind them.

She stares into the darkness, straining to see, searching for him. She closes her eyes, searching now for his mind.
81) 2) dialog: Theo, please ... Silence. At last, she opens her eyes, tears welling. RACHEL (CONT’D) (whispers) I need you. Rachel sighs, alone in the dark. She turns and trudges back up the tunnel towards the firelight. Nothing stirs in the darkness ... then a ripple of FIRE like gasoline igniting, courses out from the stone in Theo’s hand, revealing him right there, watching her go. Wordlessly, he turns and heads down the tunnel, determine and alone.
83) 0) text: Rachel steps back into the cave where she left Mr Jones. She pauses, watching him. Mr Jones looks like he’s at death’s door. His eyes are closed. His breath rattles in his chest. Rachel kneels beside him.

89) 3) dialog: They left us! They wheel around, their backs to the sea. DARK SHAPES seem to melt out of the cliff and fan out around Mr Jones and Rachel, advancing slowly. Jones pushes Rachel behind him clumsily as they back away. He raises shaking, gnarled fists.
89) 4) dialog: Can you stop them?
89) 6) dialog: We don’t need long. Jones looks ... and then sweeps a wall of flame in front of them. The Wilberforces rear back, shrieking. From behind the rocks Ricky roars up beside them. The Wilberforces fight to see through the flames ... To see Clementine helping Mr Jones and Rachel onto the SEA LADY as it pulls away.

91) 8) dialog: Y’know, maybe those other twins would’ve made it if you’d stayed. If you’d helped them instead of saving yourself. His back still to her, Jones closes his eyes, the memory painful. RACHEL (CONT’D) You can go find more twins if you want. But I don’t get a choice — I'll die before I turn my back on him. She spins and races for the trees. Her words hit Mr Jones hard. He looks surprised, then suddenly resolute:

Tiny licks of fire spark at his finger tips. Wilberforce regards the old man with disdain. Mr Jones holds out Rachel’s stone. Fearful, she meets his gaze. He nods:
