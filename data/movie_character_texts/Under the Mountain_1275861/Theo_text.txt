3) 2) dialog: No. As he gets to the top, his foot slips on the wire. Instinctively, he throws out a hand, Rachel meets it with her own, steadying him on the fence. The pair are about 14 and have the same COPPER HAIR and green eyes: they’re unmistakably TWINS. They both jump down. Rachel grabs Theo’s bag and runs off, Theo in pursuit. They run together up the road — matched for speed, Rachel just ahead.

Uncle Cliff grabs a handful of chips and collapses onto the couch in between Theo and Ricky, who protest noisily.

A large kitchen with expensive fittings. A small TV, switched on, the sound muted. On the bench is a selection of cereal boxes. Theo scans them, trying to decide. MOMENTS LATER: Theo serves himself a bowl of ice cream and starts eating. On TV, a smiling TV NEWS READER talks against a backdrop image of CENTRAL AUCKLAND and the heading Auckland Shaken. Theo grabs the REMOTE and switches on the sound —
22) 5) dialog: (to himself) Bleeding skies. Theo sits in a soft couch with his back to the lake. He’s reading a hardback book — VOLCANOES OF AUCKLAND, circa the 1980s. He flips through the pages. A MAP OF AUCKLAND shows the VOLCANOES marked in red. EXT. AUNT & UNCLE’S HOUSE - DAY 37 Rachel, in a bright life jacket, drags a kayak down the grass to the water’s edge. She climbs in and pushes off.
23) 0) text: Rachel cuts across the black water, paddling carefully but confidently. She peers down into the darkness, spooked — it’s deep down there. Rachel looks up to find she’s nearing the Wilberforce house. Dead trees frame the house, skeletal fingers reaching out across the water. Seen from the lake through leafless branches and tangled vines, the Wilberforce house is dark and tumbledown, weatherboards thick with moss, roof rotten and sunken-in, windows dark. No signs of life. CREEAAK! The back door opens, just a crack. Something moves in the darkness beyond. Rachel's eyes widen ... then she squeals as a branch snags her hair. INT. AUNT & UNCLE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 39 Theo jerks, reaches to his head. He looks out to where Rachel and the kayak bob in the shadow of the dead trees.

MT EDEN ROAD/RICKY’S CAR - DAY 47 Ricky’s car drives through the centre of Mt Eden, towards the grassy cone of the volcano towering above. A sign reads MT EDEN SUMMIT. Ricky’s car follows the road up towards Mt Eden. Ricky drives, the twins crammed into the car with him. Craggy trees line the road like a tunnel of gnarled talons, sunlight filtering through in eerie shafts. Rachel’s eyes widen — A DARK FIGURE can be glimpsed between the trunks, still as a statue, as if watching the car. Rachel looks back — the figure is gone, hidden by the trees.

Uncle Cliff stands on the deck of a bobbing boat — THE SEA LADY — expertly playing and casting a large fishing rod. Ricky sits behind, wearing a lifejacket and holding his phone in the air, trying to get a signal. A snorkel surfaces from the black water in a puff of spray ... Theo follows it, coming up for air. He turns towards the mountain, treading water. Theo jerks under — — then comes up spluttering. Rachel surfaces behind him and laughs.
33) 1) dialog: Dick. Theo swims back towards the boat. Rachel looks up at the looming black peak and frowns, as though remembering something once said to her ...

35) 12) dialog: Keep the light off, that’s good. He peers through the binoculars. There is a thump and rustle from behind him. Theo lowers the binoculars and turns around. Ricky glowers at Theo as Clementine, sitting on the edge of the bed, pulls her T-shirt on over her bra. Theo stares, open mouthed. Clementine glares back at him.

His torch picks out an OLD SIGN, lying tangled in dead creepers and branches. Theo clears them away to reveal the faded words beneath: WILBERFORCE FUNERAL SERVICES. He clicks off the light and watches, breathing quietly. The house is silent, the door closed. Slipping from his hiding place, Theo darts up the bare ground to the house. He tries to peer through the boards on the windows, then steps up on the porch — wooden boards creak. The front door seems to be locked. Theo pushes on it, experimentally — it opens a crack — FOOTSTEPS crunch toward him from the darkness. He plasters himself against the wall — pinned, exposed — (CONTINUED)
36) 5) dialog: I can do what I want. He turns off the torch and heads back into the house.
37) 0) text: Rachel appears behind Theo and they stare, open mouthed . What may have once been rooms, furniture or stairs have decayed into an open cavernous space. Everything grows with twisted organic matter — as if the house itself has formed out of gnarled scar tissue. The twins creep forward to look, taking it in with horror. Theo swings the torch slowly around. Vague remnants of wooden beams and doorways poke from the awful fleshiness. A sudden JOLT, as though someone just picked the house up and shook it — then a CLATTER as an EARTHQUAKE rolls through the house, its ancient weatherboards shifting and groaning. Dust sifts down from above. Silence. The twins look around, wide-eyed.

41) 10) dialog: Wait — they said they’d kill us — me and my sister. Jones stops in his tracks, suddenly interested — almost wolfish.
41) 14) dialog: They could smell us. Jones looks around, as if suddenly paranoid. Theo follows his gaze. A GANGLY FIGURE stands silhouetted on the far side of the crater rim, watching them.
41) 15) dialog: What is it? CLOSE ON: the figure, thin and somehow disjointed- looking, dark eyes under craggy features — a WILBERFORCE, watching Theo and Mr Jones, eyes glittering with malice —
42) 2) dialog: What’s wrong?

She ducks back from the window. 84 85 86 UNDER THE MOUNTAIN © 2008 Redhead Films 38. INT. AUNT & UNCLE’S HOUSE - DAY 84 Rachel runs down the stairs. She locks the front door, slides the chain across. She looks around, the house suddenly terrifyingly exposed: windows everywhere. Rachel pulls curtains across frantically. She gets to the kitchen and checks that the door is locked. She ducks, panting, against the wall.

AUNT & UNCLE’S HOUSE/MEZZANINE - DAY 88B Dangling high above the floor like a fish on a line, Rachel twists around and unzips the hoodie and slips out of Mr Wilberforce's clutches, dropping — hard — onto the couch below. Rachel rights herself, stunned, and stumbles to the kitchen. EXT. AUNT & UNCLE’S BACK GARDEN - DAY 89 Rachel staggers away from the house towards the lake shore, her arm hanging limp, the skin blistered. She looks into the water. Her terrified reflection stares back from the surface. She looks back to see Mr Wilberforce striding down the garden toward her ... then throws herself into the water. Mr Wilberforce reaches the edge. The surface of the lake churns. There’s no sign of her.

Theo takes his glowing stone out of his pocket and holds it aloft. Whispers swirl urgently. The stone's fiery light casts flickering shadows around the room. (CONTINUED)
63) 2) dialog: Rachel! He races up the last few steps. Upstairs, the ruined house is less decayed — though patches of the Wilberforces’ fleshy rot seep up the walls into the faded wallpaper. BELOW, Mr Wilberforce lets out a clattering BARK as he climbs the stairs. Ahead of Theo, a DRONE holds the struggling Rachel.
63) 3) dialog: Let her go! (CONTINUED)
63) 6) dialog: I said ... LET HER GO! A burst of FLAME encircles his hand, spitting from the stone! Theo’s eyes widen in surprise. The Drone SQUEALS and drops Rachel, backing into a dark room. Theo rushes to her and helps her up.
63) 8) dialog: I don’t know. The twins run down the hallway, to a closed door ahead. Theo turns the handle — it’s locked! Mr Wilberforce reaches the top of the stairs and advances down the hallway, his tall frame filling the passage. Though he still looks human, his skin and clothes seem to run with slime and ichor — his form breaking down. He breathes wetly and steps forward. Theo holds up his glowing stone.
63) 9) dialog: Stop!
63) 11) dialog: Cause we’re not gonna let you have our planet! They back away down the hall as Wilberforce advances, trailing slime. His form seems to be losing cohesion, his proportions exaggerated by the shifting shadows. The Drone stands behind him ... joined now by a SECOND DRONE, reaching the top of the stairs. In the shifting shadows, the cramped hallway seems crowded with ghastly Wilberforces. Mr Wilberforce’s arms seem distended ... his hands, the sleeves of his jacket, split into tentacles that writhe and flick. (CONTINUED)

72) 6) dialog: I'll give you a leg up. Rachel steps forward. Theo helps her up.
72) 7) dialog: Take a deep breath and kick as hard as you can. He helps her up into the pinched maw - she pushes hands through, finds leverage ... She takes a deep breath and shoves her head into the hole. Shoulders, torso, hips ... and finally shoes disappear with a sucking noise. Alone now, Theo looks back. The maw of the tunnel parts, expelling air in advance of its passengers — Theo jumps up to grasp the edges of the membrane. He can't pull himself up. He jumps again, desperate now as the rushing echo of the Wilberforces fills the air. Panicking, Theo watches the tunnel opening, eyes wide with terror — Water splatters down.

It SNIFFS deeply, picking up his scent.Theo cowers ... and is suddenly YANKED violently from the ground, sinewy tendrils whipping around his body from behind!

Theo swings around and — BLAM — sends cords of fire lashing out into the dark. The tentacles around him whip away ... The creatures shriek and bark, tentacles flail. Theo scrambles to his feet.
