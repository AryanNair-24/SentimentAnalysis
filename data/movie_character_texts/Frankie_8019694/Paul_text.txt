27) 7) dialog: It’s already on the market, and she’s made up her mind. She's leaving everything she’s got to the Conservatoire, which is not much, it turns out, besides the apartment. The news stops Sylvia cold in her tracks. She leans on th ancient, moss covered rail wall that accompanies the road
27) 9) dialog: She worked her whole life. She can do whatever she wants with her money. And what she wants is to be remembered. She’s setting up the Frangoise Cremont Scholarship Fund for poor and needy actresses. That’s what she wants. I’m sorry her death won’t help you leave your boring husband, but I quite like the idea. Sylvia picks up her pace, walking fast away from Paul.
27) 10) dialog: Sylvia. Sylvia!
34) 8) dialog: Papa, je vous rejoins. Papa, I'll catch up with you.
34) 11) dialog: And you live there, is that right?

34) 19) dialog: We'll be fine by ourselves, thank you. Ilene is taken aback.
34) 20) dialog: I’m sorry.
34) 22) dialog: I know she did. She wanted us to meet. She’s afraid I’m going to end up alone in New York City.
34) 24) dialog: Can I tell a story, about Frankie?
34) 26) dialog: But I want you to hear it. It will help you understand our family a little better. You see, Jimmy's always had a thing for Portugal. We’re all thankful to him for that. It’s a gift he gave us: Portugal. (MORE )
34) 28) dialog: This is probably our fifth or sixth time to come here together. And Sintra particularly, you know they came here on their honeymoon, don’t you? That is their second honeymoon. They had each had others before. But when my mom first started seeing him, he took us on a trip to the Algarve. Have you been?
34) 30) dialog: Praia da Falésia, beautiful beach south of here, and twenty years ago, before the Portugal renaissance, or destruction, depending on who’s talking, it was almost deserted. Really gorgeous. Mom, Jimmy, and Sylvia, his daughter Sylvia. Have you met, Sylvia?
34) 32) dialog: She's lovely, a little damaged, but lovely. We all went to the Algarve together. Mom had moved to London, but only for a short time, for a film, but clearly she and Jimmy were also testing the waters, for the new family to be. A family vacation was decided, and off we went. I barely spoke any English at the time. I was just your average French schoolboy, so as you can imagine I was very nervous. Excited, but nervous. Particularly because of Sylvia. I had met her a couple of times, and, really, you might not know it now, but she was the most beautiful girl ever. She was, she is - a few years older than me. I was maybe fifteen, and she was eighteen or nineteen. She had a woman’s body already. A beautiful body. When I saw her in a bikini, oh my God... And I was such a boy! Anyway, it was summer, and hot, and she and I would spend the whole day on the beach together. (MORE )
34) 34) dialog: Maybe I don’t need to go on. You get the picture, right? Ilene doesn’t answer. Paul continues.
34) 35) dialog: One night, Mom and Jimmy went out to dinner, and we said, Sylvia and I, we were going to stay home, and watch TV. They were showing the movie Grease on TV. You remember. (sings Summer Lovin’) Tell me more, tell me more, did you get very far. Ilene chuckles.
34) 36) dialog: I don’t know what got into me, because I was actually a very shy boy, pimples, and skinny, and very uncomfortable, but I got up and I started to imitate John Travolta. I grabbed Sylvia so we could dance together, and she screamed! Not because she didn’t want to. No, she was sun burned. And so, naturally, I offered to put some lotion on her shoulders. She took her shirt off. A GIRL trotting on a HORSE comes their way, following a BLONDE TRAINER, who holds the reins of her horse with whi gloves.
34) 37) dialog: When my mom and Jimmy came back, we were having sex on the couch. Me and my soon-to-be step sister. The riders come fast, and Paul and Ilene have to make spa for them to pass by on the road.
34) 38) dialog: As you can imagine, that was the end of this new family idea. I was sent back to live with Michel in Paris. And my mother moved to London. To live with Jimmy and Sylvia. And that was that. Ilene takes it in. 91.
34) 39) dialog: You see, in Portugal, I lost my mother once already. It only seems fitting that I’m here again now. He stops, and looks at Ilene more closely.
34) 40) dialog: She's right about one thing: you are very attractive, you know.
34) 42) dialog: Maybe. My mother would like us to get married. Ilene is silent.
34) 43) dialog: Do you think you are the marrying type?
34) 45) dialog: I didn’t think so. An uncomfortable moment between them.
34) 47) dialog: I don’t know now. Everything is a bit up in the air, as you can imagine, scheduling-wise.
34) 49) dialog: Oh no. Pity! 40 92.
34) 51) dialog: I see.
34) 53) dialog: Yes, I understand. They stand for a moment, together. Nothing more to be sai it seems.
34) 54) dialog: I’m going to go now, and catch up with my father.
34) 56) dialog: Yes, I’m sure we will. Paul walks off, back in the direction of Michel and Tiago few feet away, he turns, and calls out to Ilene.
34) 57) dialog: Ilene. She turns and stops.
34) 58) dialog: Thank you for listening. She smiles, this time warmly, before they walk their sepa ways.
