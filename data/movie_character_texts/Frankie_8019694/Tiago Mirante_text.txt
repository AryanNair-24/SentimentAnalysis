15) 1) dialog: Many, many years ago, at a time when the Barbarians dominated Portugal, there lived in Sintra a princess named Eufemia, who fell in love with a nice country boy. Carlinhos runs up the road, to an open area where the qua Church of Santa Eufemia is built.
15) 2) dialog: Her father the King was a very tough, conservative man, and wouldn't allow the relationship with a commoner, so they had to stop seeing each other once and for all. Carlinhos looks at the simple church, white, with a coupl small green windows, the image of a female saint on tiles the side, and a cross at the very top. It’s strikingly beautiful in its simplicity. CARLINHOS’S MOTHER (0O.S.) Carlinhos!! Volta!! Carlinhos runs back towards his mother. We get closer to church, where Michel is standing outside, next to Tiago. 42.

18) 16) dialog: That's why I look so tired today. I went out to dinner with a friend last night, another guide, and when I called my wife later to say “goodnight, I love you”, she already knew where I’d been, what I drank, and who else was at the restaurant. It was incredible. We stayed up for hours on the phone, which is not good for my business. I have to be alert, and the days are not short, you know? Tiago takes a long drag.

47) 1) text: We see a small chapel perched on top of the hillside. Frankie is inside, an abandoned ruin made of stone walls wooden floors. Instead of doors and windows, just their g between walls. It’s dark, quiet and there’s nothing to see, like a death chamber. Frankie touches the walls, feeling the rock, and listening to her own footsteps. She sees a stream of wate running down the old wall. She extends her hand, and feel the water on her skin. Outside, a few clouds fly by against the still blue sky, taken by strong winds. Frankie hears a sound, and in the rear of the chapel, alm in darkness, she sees Tiago, with his cell phone and a li cigarette.
