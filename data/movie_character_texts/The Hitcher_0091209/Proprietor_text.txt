He flops into a booth by the window and stares forlornly out the pane glass at the highway and the relentless procession of cars and trucks streaking across it. Jim rests his elbows on the table and puts his face in his hands. Somebody slides into the seat across from him. The kid drops his hands. John Ryder is sighting him down with his trademark bullet eyes. His black raincoated shoulders unfurl like bat wings, his unearthly transistor radio voice makes Jim sink into the seat cushion.
35) 28) dialog: That coffee's to go because I don't want you hanging out here. Take it and get going. The owner goes away. Phoenix scans the place in vain for the Hitcher.

Several of them come inside to fetch food from the Proprietor. Rest stop. Halsey downs his coffee in a single gulp, smacking his lips.
