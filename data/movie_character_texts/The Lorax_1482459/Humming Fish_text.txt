There’s a LOUD NOISE and a FLASH OF LIGHT as a thundersto shoots out of the stump. The animals watch from a safe distance. The one fish slaps the other fish for poking the stump. The Swomee-Swans shove their head in the ground like ostriches. A Bar-Ba-Loot tries it and knocks himself out. A series of lightning bolts hit the stump causing an explosion that reverberates through the valley. Lou struggles to stand up in the wind. A fish flies into face, knocking him over. The whole thunderstorm is sucked back into the stump and pops-— THE LORAX. Shortish, brownish, and in charge. He slowly stands up. Sees the stump, reacts horrified.
