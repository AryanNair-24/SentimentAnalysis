19) 0) text: Michael rounds the turn and stops short. Star and Laddie are surrounded by the Lost Boys.  Michael feels upstaged.

She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair. (beat) I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.

It is obvious that he is becoming extremely exhausted and rapidly losing strength.

His "human" eyes roll back into his head until his "vampire" eyes -- glowing red slits -- take their place. Laddie opens his mouth and a beam of light shoots out. His fangs begin to descend... POPPING his braces off. Edgar's and Alan's ankles dangle temptingly before him.
152) 16) dialog: RIPS through it!  Bedcovers are shredded and mattress stuffing and springs explode into the air.  Laddie has transformed into the ugliest, meanest little vampire imaginable. Alan and Edgar SCREAM at the top of their lungs and leap away from the bed in terror.

Star rushes in, sees what's happening, and steps between Laddie and the Frogs.
