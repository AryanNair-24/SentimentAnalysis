37) 39) text: The laughter dies down as a NEW SONG comes on the radio. It's apparently a favorite of the Lost Boys because the MUSIC is immediately TURNED UP LOUD and all thoughts of Michael seem to be forgotten. Everyone begins to move to the music.  Star encourages Michael to dance with her.  He's feeling the effects of the joint he smoked and his balance is a little off.  His head is spinning. During all this, David has located a bottle of wine.  He pours some into a paper cup and offers it to Michael. Michael is about to drink when Star holds his arm.

A look of terror comes into Michael's expression.
48) 15) text: The train THUNDERS across the trestle overhead, only a foot or two above them. The ROAR and the NOISE are tremendous.  The heat.  The smoke.  The dust. The boys grimace and hold on for dear life.  Then, Michael reacts in horror as:

48) 25) text: They WHISTLE and CAT CALL and do everything they can to goad him on.  All the while invisible in the darkness below. Michael lets go.  He drops into the fog. His eyes widen with fright -- but -- for a moment he is buoyant -- suspended in mid-air -- floating! And then... he drops.  With a WHOOSH.  Like dead weight. The wind RUSHING around his ears.  He loses consciousness
49) 2) text: Michael stirs.
49) 3) dialog: Mom's home?...
49) 5) text: Michael glances at the clock.  It's two in the afternoon.

Headlights flash across the window curtains, accompanied by the unmistakeable ROAR of MOTORBIKE ENGINES -- as if they were going around the house. The WHISPERING grows LOUDER.  It seems to be saying "Michael, Michael, Michael."  He goes for the front door.
56) 4) text: Michael throws open the door, and -- Nothing.  The front yard is empty.  But a blast of cold air rushes into the house and a WEIRD ECHOING sound rever berates across the sky. A low ground fog is rolling in as well.  Sam and Michael look bewildered.

107) 18) dialog: That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood. (beat) I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
107) 20) dialog: Why not?
107) 22) dialog: Then it's not too late for us...
107) 24) dialog: I know, I've felt it...
107) 26) text: Sam gulps as Michael kisses her.  Star senses something and gets frightened.
107) 28) dialog: You're not going anywhere... (turning) Sam...
107) 29) text: In a wink, Star is gone... out the window.  We don't even see her leave.  Michael and Sam lean out after her.
107) 30) dialog: Star.
107) 33) dialog: Who are you calling?
108) 6) text: Michael comes down the stairs looking weak and fragile. Dark glasses perched upon an ashen face.
108) 11) dialog: Of course not!
108) 15) dialog: David.
108) 17) dialog: I'll take you there.
108) 19) text: Michael grabs Edgar by the arm.
108) 20) dialog: I said, I'll take you there. Nobody's going near Star without me.
108) 22) text: Michael releases his grip.  Edgar rubs his arm.
111) 0) text: This is why:  Michael has fallen asleep at the wheel, his chin touches his chest. A car behind HONKS.  Michael wakes up an continues driving.  Edgar warns Michael.
112) 1) dialog: Down there.
112) 2) text: The Frogs charge ahead down the old stairs.  Michael seem to stumble.  Sam supports him.
112) 3) dialog: Sam... if something happens to me. If I don't have the strength to go on, promise me you won't let them hurt Star.
113) 0) text: Edgar and Alan step into the lobby and look around with wide-eyed wonderment.  A moment later, Michael and Sam come up behind them.  Sam is also amazed by what he sees.
113) 2) text: As they search for the entrance to the sleep chamber, Michael goes to the spot where he knows Star will be in the far corner of the lobby. Michael bends down to her.  She looks like a sleeping angel.  He shakes her gently.
113) 3) dialog: Star.  You're coming with me.
113) 7) dialog: You've got to put this on.
113) 9) dialog: Huh?
113) 11) text: Michael glances over to where Laddie is sleeping.  Star's eyes beseech him.  Michael gives in to her wishes.  He begins to wrap Laddie (who doesn't awaken) in a blanket.
114) 0) text: Michael emerges from the cave with a bundled Laddie in his arms.  The sun beats down.  Laddie awakens.  He looks around with uncomprehending eyes.  Michael adjusts the blanket to keep the sun off Laddie's face. Michael staggers up the old stairs.
116) 0) text: Michael arrives at the Chevy with Laddie in his arms.  He opens the back door and places Laddie on the seat.  Laddi remains sound asleep as Michael makes certain that his face is covered and away from the sun. Then, turning away from the car, he heads back toward the cave.  It is obvious that he is becoming extremely exhausted and rapidly losing strength.
118) 0) text: Michael returns for Star.  He looks awful.  Star reaches out and touches his hand.  Michael wraps her in the hoode cape and lifts her.
121) 0) text: Michael carries Star towards the car.  He is weakening. His legs buckle and he sinks to his knees.  Star's hood falls back revealing her face.  Michael finds inspiration in her beauty and struggles to his feet, lurching toward the Chevy.
124) 0) text: They arrive to find Michael passed out beside the car. Sam and the Frogs shove Michael into the front seat.
125) 0) text: Edgar gets in front next to Michael.  Alan gets in back next to Star and Laddie.  They find it very distasteful to be this close to vampires. Sam turns the ignition and the car FIRES UP.  Hesitates.
128) 11) text: Michael's head slumps against Edgar's shoulder.  Edgar pushes him away -- and Michael awakens.
128) 13) dialog: Huh?...
128) 16) text: As the Chevy barrels down the highway, Sam and Edgar assist Michael into the driver's seat.  There is some pretty dangerous climbing going on in the front seat -- and for a moment it appears that no one has actual control of the car.
128) 18) text: Michael, Sam and Edgar look up to see the stoplight. The Chevy rushes toward it.
128) 20) text: Michael -- acting very dopey -- finally hits the brake. But Sam must take control of the steering wheel because Michael's hands keep slipping off.
129) 0) text: All enter.  Michael carries Star in his arms.  Sam and the Frogs carry Laddie.  As they approach the stairs, Nanook comes racing up to them, BARKING loudly.
129) 4) dialog: Take him outside, Sam!
129) 9) dialog: No, Grandpa...
130) 0) text: Edgar and Alan watch from the hallway as Michael makes Star and Laddie comfortable on his bed.  Sam comes up the stairs, looks into the bedroom, then turns to the Frogs.
138) 0) text: Michael goes to the window.  It looks as if his strength is returning. He pulls back the curtain and looks out.  He has a commanding view of Santa Carla.  The sun has just dropped below the horizon. Michael turns to Laddie and Star who begin to stir from their resting place on the bed.  Star and Michael exchange an anxious expression.
138) 2) dialog: They'll be coming for all of us.
138) 3) text: Then Michael goes to his closet and takes out a very serious-looking hunting bow and arrow quiver.
141) 0) text: Sam, Michael, Edgar, Alan, Star and Laddie are assembled for final instructions.  Sam and the Frogs carry loaded water guns.  Michael has his bow and arrow.
141) 2) text: Michael and Sam exchange a look.  Then, Nanook begins to BARK from outside.
141) 6) dialog: Sam, don't --
148) 6) text: Edgar takes Michael's bedroom himself.
149) 4) dialog: Duck, Sam.
149) 5) text: Michael, recovered, releases an arrow.  It WHOOSHES through the air and sinks into Dwayne's throat. Dwayne ROARS in horror and pain.  So loud is his cry that windows SHATTER and light bulbs POP. Then, as if illuminated from within, Dwayne's body begins to glow.  It CRACKLES with electrical energy.  HISSES and FIZZES.  Then vanishes from sight.
150) 2) text: Sam and Michael's bedrooms are connected by the bath- room.  Alan hears Edgar's cry and enters the bathroom fro Sam's side, coming up behind Paul. Alan sees the bathtub filled with holy water and has an idea.  He gets down on his hands and knees behind Paul. Edgar catches on and head-butts Paul, knocking him back- wards.  Paul trips over Alan and falls into the tub with a SPLASH. The water burns!  Paul SCREAM and kicks.  The water turns to a frothy pink and yellow foam -- boiling up, spitting, and shooting into the air like a geyser.  Alan and Edgar jump back.  And in a moment... Paul is gone.
154) 0) text: David and Michael continue their aerial dog-fight. Michael looks like he's getting the worst of it. David gets the edge on him.  He comes up under Michael, grabs him by the waist and continues to fly upward until Michael's head BANGS against the ceiling, knocking him unconscious. Michael drops to the floor.
156) 0) text: Michael regains consciousness in time to see David approaching him.
156) 2) text: Michael gets slowly to his feet, never taking his eyes off David.
156) 4) text: Michael doesn't believe him -- but he looks worried. Then, David attacks.  He leaps at Michael... and the fight is on! Michael grabs a wooden hat rack and swings it like a bat.  It connects with David's head, but David is unphased.  Michael swings again and David catches the hat rack, yanks it from Michael's grasp and SNAPS it in two as if it were a twig.  Michael charges. They tumble through the air, fighting fiercely.  CRASHING from one room to the next.
158) 0) text: Michael and David SLAM each other into walls.  Finally, David picks up Michael's chest and propels him back- wards, two feet off the ground, back --
158) 5) text: Michael doesn't listen.  He struggles, but can't free himself.
160) 0) text: David presses hard against the barbells.  The weights sink into the wall and the bar itself begins to crush Michael's throat.
160) 2) text: David turns to see Star standing behind him.  She holds the pointed, broken hat rack in her hands. David releases his grip on the barbells.  They fall to the floor.  So does Michael -- holding his throat and gasping for air.
160) 7) dialog: David!
160) 8) text: David spins in Michael's direction.  Somehow, Michael has summoned up a hidden reserve of strength.  He holds the barbells in his hands.
160) 9) dialog: Catch!
160) 12) text: The hat rack enters his back, pierces his heart, and exits through his chest. David SCREAMS and BELLOWS and pulls out the stake. Light pours from the hole in his body like a brilliant searchlight. Then David flies up and HITS the ceiling -- still HOWLING and YELLING and SPARKING like a Roman candle. Then -- like a balloon losing its air -- he begins to deflate and ROCKET around the room on a wild, spinning flight. Star and Michael duck to avoid being hit. David is heading toward the ceiling.
164) 0) text: Sam, Laddie and the Frogs come down the stairs to see Michael holding Star in his arms. All is silent.  And slowly they realize that they have triumphed.
164) 2) text: Sam notices that Michael, Star and Laddie don't look pleased.
164) 4) dialog: I... I don't feel any differently. (to Star) Do you?
166) 6) text: Michael and Sam don't know what to say or where to begin.  Then we notice that Max wears and expression of pure anguish.
166) 10) text: Sam, Michael, the Frogs, Laddie and Star know what Max is talking about, and they react in horror.  But Lucy is still in the dark.
166) 24) text: Max advances toward Lucy.  He is the meanest, nastiest, foulest, oldest vampire of them all.  And all the evil and depravity that dwells within his soulless being now manifests itself in his ghastly appearence. Everyone SCREAMS. He moves toward Lucy.  Yellow eyes flashing.  Fangs descending below his jaw.  Skin rancid.  Breath foul. Michael steps between Max and his mother.
166) 25) dialog: I didn't invite you in this time!
166) 27) dialog: Get out, Mom!  Run!
166) 28) text: Max ROARS and everyone is knocked to the ground and held there by the sound.  Everyone but Michael, that is. He alone is left standing to face Max.
166) 32) text: Michael and Max do battle.  Michael is brave, but fool- ish.  He doesn't have a chance. Holding Michael by the ankle, Max spins him over his head.  Michael hits against the walls and the bannister, SNAPPING off the rails one by one. Then, Max releases him and Michael sails across the room and lands in a heap.  Exhausted and defeated.
168) 2) text: Everyone is able to get to their feet now.  Sam sees Max's driving cap on the floor.  He picks it up and tosses it into the now dying vortex. Michael and Star trade joyful expressions.
168) 3) dialog: It's gone.  I feel it!
168) 7) text: Michael hugs Star.
168) 8) dialog: Everyone accounted for?
