60) 13) dialog: But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
60) 15) dialog: Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.

104) 37) dialog: Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.

166) 12) dialog: It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and yours.
166) 16) dialog: Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
166) 21) dialog: It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.

166) 23) dialog: I still want you, Lucy... I haven't changed my mind about that.

And all the evil and depravity that dwells within his soulless being now manifests itself in his ghastly appearence. Everyone SCREAMS. He moves toward Lucy.  Yellow eyes flashing.  Fangs descending below his jaw.  Skin rancid.  Breath foul. Michael steps between Max and his mother.

166) 32) text: Michael and Max do battle.  Michael is brave, but fool- ish.  He doesn't have a chance. Holding Michael by the ankle, Max spins him over his head.  Michael hits against the walls and the bannister, SNAPPING off the rails one by one. Then, Max releases him and Michael sails across the room and lands in a heap.  Exhausted and defeated.
166) 35) dialog: Don't fight.  It's so much better if you don't fight.
166) 36) text: He lowers his head to her neck.  Lucy looks over his shoulder, sees something through the front window.  With all her strength she pushes away from Max, and...

168) 2) text: Everyone is able to get to their feet now.  Sam sees Max's driving cap on the floor.  He picks it up and tosses it into the now dying vortex. Michael and Star trade joyful expressions.
169) 0) text: The place is deserted.  CAMERA PROWLS.  Then, one by one, KIDS begin to arrive.  At first we don't recognize them.  But then we realize they are:  The Runaways who Lucy gave food to... Maria from the Video Store... A couple of Surf Naxis... (and perhaps others.)  They are here to take up where the Lost Boys left off. CAMERA PUSHES PAST THEM, toward the old mural painted on the lobby wall.  The mural depicts a typical day on the boardwalk in the year 1900. CAMERA MOVES CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE MURAL. And HOLDS TIGHT on one painted figure in particular: A man in a straw hat.  He's grinning broadly... and he's most definitely Max.
