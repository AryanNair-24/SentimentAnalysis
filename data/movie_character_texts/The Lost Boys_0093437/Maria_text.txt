Maria from the Video Store... A couple of Surf Naxis... (and perhaps others.)  They are here to take up where the Lost Boys left off. CAMERA PUSHES PAST THEM, toward the old mural painted on the lobby wall.  The mural depicts a typical day on the boardwalk in the year 1900. CAMERA MOVES CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE MURAL. And HOLDS TIGHT on one painted figure in particular: A man in a straw hat.  He's grinning broadly... and he's most definitely Max.
