Sam begins to examine the treasure trove of comics when he suddenly becomes aware of TWO TEENAGERS, EDGAR and ALAN -- tough little dudes in fatigues with cold eyes -- victims of too many Chuck Norris movies.  They are busy stacking old comics on the racks from cardboard boxes. They are the FROG BROTHERS.

16) 11) dialog: If you're gonna live around here, then here's one you don't wanna be without.
45) 3) dialog: Or a vampire.
45) 5) dialog: You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you?  Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
45) 8) dialog: This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
45) 12) dialog: Hey, man, take this... It's on the house.
71) 1) dialog: You did the right thing, calling us.  Does your brother sleep a lot?
72) 4) dialog: Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
72) 9) dialog: Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
72) 14) dialog: Or it's your funeral.

97) 3) dialog: As a matter of fact, we're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at City Hall.
97) 6) dialog: That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
97) 9) dialog: I told you that comic would save your life.
97) 11) dialog: I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
97) 15) dialog: All together?
97) 18) dialog: Hey, just because a Marine hasn't seen combat, doesn't mean he still isn't a Marine.  Let's check out your mother's boy friend.
104) 0) text: Everyone is seated around the dinner table.  Edgar and Alan concentrate on Max's behavior.  Lucy serves spaghetti from a large plate.

104) 24) dialog: (in a whisper) He's not glowing.
104) 30) dialog: You do?!
108) 1) dialog: Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
108) 2) dialog: The Prince of Darkness.
108) 4) dialog: El Vampiro.
108) 7) dialog: This guy looks more like a zombie.
108) 10) dialog: I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
108) 12) dialog: If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
108) 14) dialog: To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.

111) 1) dialog: Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
113) 0) text: Edgar and Alan step into the lobby and look around with wide-eyed wonderment.  A moment later, Michael and Sam come up behind them.  Sam is also amazed by what he sees.

113) 14) text: Edgar shines a flashlight up there.
113) 15) dialog: It's an opening, all right.  Let's try it.  Somebody give me a boost.
115) 0) text: Sam, Edgar and Alan have all entered the tunnel via the elevator and now make their way down its long, dark length. FLIES begins to BUZZ around.  Sam tries to swat them away.
115) 1) dialog: We're on the right trail.  Flies and the undead go together like ham and eggs.
117) 0) text: Edgar, Alan and Sam are frozen in place with mouths hanging open.  We don't know why until the CAMERA PANS DOWN and we see:
119) 2) dialog: Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
122) 4) dialog: That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin. (starting to climb) Let's stake 'em.
125) 0) text: Edgar gets in front next to Michael.  Alan gets in back next to Star and Laddie.  They find it very distasteful to be this close to vampires. Sam turns the ignition and the car FIRES UP.  Hesitates.
125) 1) dialog: Come on.  Burn rubber.
125) 2) text: Edgar STOMPS down hard on the gas pedal.
128) 2) dialog: Shut up!
128) 4) dialog: They pulled a mind-scramble on us, man!  It wasn't our fault! They opened their eyes and talked!
128) 6) dialog: What?
128) 10) dialog: This is all we need!  To be caught driving without a license... and in the possession of vampires!
128) 11) text: Michael's head slumps against Edgar's shoulder.  Edgar pushes him away -- and Michael awakens.
128) 16) text: As the Chevy barrels down the highway, Sam and Edgar assist Michael into the driver's seat.  There is some pretty dangerous climbing going on in the front seat -- and for a moment it appears that no one has actual control of the car.
128) 18) text: Michael, Sam and Edgar look up to see the stoplight. The Chevy rushes toward it.
128) 22) dialog: They're looking at us.
129) 2) dialog: Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
130) 0) text: Edgar and Alan watch from the hallway as Michael makes Star and Laddie comfortable on his bed.  Sam comes up the stairs, looks into the bedroom, then turns to the Frogs.
130) 4) dialog: We don't have one yet. (looks at his watch) And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
130) 6) dialog: The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.

135) 4) dialog: That's just the way we like it.
141) 0) text: Sam, Michael, Edgar, Alan, Star and Laddie are assembled for final instructions.  Sam and the Frogs carry loaded water guns.  Michael has his bow and arrow.
141) 1) dialog: I think I should warn you all: It's never pretty when a vampire buys it.  No two bloodsuckers ever go out the same way.  Some scream and yell.  Some go quietly.  Some explode.  Some implode.  But all will try to take you with them.
141) 5) dialog: Don't go out there!  Stop him!
148) 2) dialog: Where?
148) 4) text: Edgar glances around.  Notices that the boys' bedrooms are on one side of the house and Lucy's is on the other.

148) 6) text: Edgar takes Michael's bedroom himself.
149) 0) text: Edgar cautiously enters the room -- water gun drawn. The bathroom door opens behind him and Paul quietly steps out.  He looks as horrible and nasty as Dwayne.  His face evil and rotting.  His fingernails long and sharp. Paul bares his fangs.  They are yellow and bloodstained. He is about to sink them into Edgar's neck when Edgar senses his presence and spins around.
149) 1) dialog: (startled) Ahh!!
149) 2) text: Paul lunges, but Edgar SQUIRTS him in the face with holy water.  Paul YELLS and SCREAMS and flails his arms, but Edgar continues to SQUIRT and SQUIRT, driving Paul back into the bathroom.
150) 0) text: Edgar shooting holy water as Paul backs into bathroom.
150) 1) dialog: Alan!  Alan!  I'm almost out of ammo!!
150) 2) text: Sam and Michael's bedrooms are connected by the bath- room.  Alan hears Edgar's cry and enters the bathroom fro Sam's side, coming up behind Paul. Alan sees the bathtub filled with holy water and has an idea.  He gets down on his hands and knees behind Paul. Edgar catches on and head-butts Paul, knocking him back- wards.  Paul trips over Alan and falls into the tub with a SPLASH. The water burns!  Paul SCREAM and kicks.  The water turns to a frothy pink and yellow foam -- boiling up, spitting, and shooting into the air like a geyser.  Alan and Edgar jump back.  And in a moment... Paul is gone.
152) 0) text: Edgar and Alan, still flushed with their victory over Paul, sit on the bed re-loading their guns with holy water.

152) 4) dialog: (very serious) Four to go.
152) 6) dialog: Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
152) 10) dialog: Death to all vampires!
152) 12) dialog: We are awesome monster-bashers!
152) 14) dialog: The baddest!

164) 1) dialog: (to Michael) You destroyed David.  His hold on you has been released.
164) 6) dialog: That means we still haven't destroyed their leader.
166) 13) dialog: I knew it!  You are a vampire!
166) 18) dialog: Sure.  The invitation protects them.
166) 19) text: Sam glares at Edgar.  As if to say, Thanks for nothing!
