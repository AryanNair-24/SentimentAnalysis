1) 0) text: Spinning merrily.  Loud CALLIOPE MUSIC.  Young kids and teenagers occupy the horses and benches.  A tough group of "SURF NAZIS" also ride.  "My Beach, My Wave" on their T-shirts. The LOST BOYS enter the carousel house.  Cool kids in dis tinctive dress.  Compelling; not threatening.  They are DAVID, MARKO, PAUL, DWAYNE; David the obvious leader. GREG, the head Surf Nazi, sits in one of the carousel's benches with his arm around his girl, SHELLY.  He thinks he's King of the Boardwalk.. And doesn't like it one bit when Shelly casts an appreciative glance toward David. David smiles back at her.  Not flirting, just being chi- valrous.  Greg scowls and takes his anger out on Paul by tripping him as he goes by.  An insult... a shove.  David joins Paul.  Surf Nazis join Greg.  The Lost Boys close ranks.  A major melee seems ready to erupt, when the ugly end of a nightstick is shoved against his Adam's apple. A three hundred pound security GUARD is at the other end. The ride suddenly ends.  CALLIOPE MUSIC STOPS.

He is about to sink them into Edgar's neck when Edgar senses his presence and spins around.

Alan sees the bathtub filled with holy water and has an idea.  He gets down on his hands and knees behind Paul. Edgar catches on and head-butts Paul, knocking him back- wards.  Paul trips over Alan and falls into the tub with a SPLASH. The water burns!  Paul SCREAM and kicks.  The water turns to a frothy pink and yellow foam -- boiling up, spitting, and shooting into the air like a geyser.  Alan and Edgar jump back.  And in a moment... Paul is gone.
