8) 15) dialog: I’m Dr. Donald Shirley. Lip’s taken aback. Not what he expected. He stands. (CONTINUED)
8) 19) dialog: Please, have a seat. Lip sits. Shirley sits on his “throne,” looking down at L
8) 22) dialog: Elephant tusks. Yes. Lip nods, points to the chain around Shirley’s neck.
8) 24) dialog: A what?
8) 27) dialog: Um, no. It was a gift.
8) 29) dialog: That’s all they told you? Lip shrugs. (CONTINUED)
8) 32) dialog: Actually, it’s a bit more complicated than that. Have you ever driven professionally before?
8) 35) dialog: I see. What other experience do you have?
8) 37) dialog: In what capacity?
8) 39) dialog: What did you do there? Lip chews on that. You can smell the wood burning...
8) 41) dialog: Well, first of all, Tony, I’m nota medical doctor. I’m a musician.
8) 43) dialog: Yes. I’m about to start a concert tour, the majority of which will be down South.
8) 47) dialog: The deep south. We start in the midwest, but then we’re taking a hard left. Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and on down through the Delta. (beat) Do you foresee any issues working for a black man?
8) 49) dialog: Oh, I see. You’re married.
8) 51) dialog: I don’t know if this is the proper job for a married man.
8) 53) dialog: My point is, you’ll be gone for eight straight weeks--with no breaks--right up until Christmas. You're quite sure you can leave your family for that long?
8) 55) dialog: Ninety dollars a week, plus room and board. But let me be crystal clear... I’m not simply hiring a chauffeur. I need someone who can handle my itinerary. I need a personal assistant. I need a valet. I need someone who will launder my clothes, shine my shoes...
8) 59) dialog: Tony... Lip turns back, faces Shirley.
8) 60) dialog: I had my record label ask around town to find me the right man. Your name came up more than once. You’ve impressed a lot of people by the way you handle... trouble. That’s why I called and asked about your availability. Lip thinks about it.
8) 62) dialog: Well, Mr. Vallelonga...thank you for coming in. As Lip turns and walks out, we --
13) 5) dialog: Thank you, Amit.
15) 0) text: Dr. Shirley’s Cadillac drives west on Route 80, followed Oleg and George.
16) 1) dialog: Tony, when we arrive in a city, the first thing I’d like you to do is check the piano where I’m playing. Make sure it’s a Steinway as per my contract. Lip pulls out a pen, writes “STAIN WAY” on the map.
16) 2) dialog: And could you see to it that I have a bottle of Cutty Sark in my room every night.
16) 5) dialog: I won't. And ten-and-two on the wheel, please. Tony loses the smile. Shirley slides over in his seat so he’s directly behind Lip. (CONTINUED)
16) 9) dialog: Birmingham, yes. It’s a Christmas show.
16) 11) dialog: We'll see. Could you please put the cigarette out?
16) 13) dialog: Because I can’t breathe back here.
16) 15) dialog: Thank you. Lip thinks about it, defiantly takes one long last drag o the heater, then another, then finally FLICKS IT OUTSIDE. Lip rolls up his window, shoots a look at the second sandwich, “Dr. Shirley” written on it. FUCK THIS GUY. He opens it, stuffs Shirley’s sandwich in his mouth, looks straight ahead.
18) 4) dialog: (in Russian) Yes. Everything's fine. Lip looks back over his shoulder, stunned to hear Shirley speaking in another language.
18) 6) dialog: (in Russian) Make a reservation for dinner. We'll rehearse immediately after. See you there. Oleg gives Lip the hairy eyeball, blows past him.
18) 9) dialog: That was Russian.
18) 14) dialog: They have the itinerary. As long as they make it to the shows on time, I don’t worry and you shouldn’t either.
19) 1) dialog: How is that? Lip thinks about it.
19) 3) dialog: Have you ever thought of being a food critic? up, hopeful.
19) 5) dialog: I’m just saying, you have a marvelous way with words when describing food. Salty. So vivid. One can almost taste it. the jab.
19) 9) dialog: We should be going soon if we expect to get to Pittsburgh by dinner.
19) 11) dialog: That's absurd. Why would women in Pittsburgh have larger breasts than, say, women in New York? Lip shrugs.
19) 14) dialog: Orphans?
19) 16) dialog: Orpheus.
19) 18) dialog: Orpheus in the Underworld. It's based on a French Opera. And those kids on the cover? They were demons in hell.
20) 1) dialog: What are you doing?
20) 3) dialog: Here? Now?
22) 1) dialog: Take this for any incidentals we may need. If you want something for yourself, you don’t have to ask me, just make sure you keep the receipts. When it runs low, let me know. Lip nods. They walk towards the exit.
22) 2) dialog: One more thing--we will be attending many events before and after the concerts, interacting with some of the wealthiest and most highly-educated people in the country. It is my feeling that your diction, as charming as it may be in the tri-state area, could use a bit of finessing.
22) 4) dialog: In the only way the word “diction” is ever used.
22) 6) dialog: Your intonation, inflection, choice of words--
22) 8) dialog: There are simple techniques I can teach you that are quite effective. I can help you. (CONTINUED)
22) 12) dialog: The profanity is another issue.
22) 14) dialog: Because you can do better. And here’s another thing--as guest of honor, I will be announced when I enter these intimate events. You will be announced as well. Vallelonga may be difficult to pronounce. I was thinking “Valle” would be more appropriate. Tony Valle. It’s short and simple.
22) 16) dialog: These are genteel people. That might be a little...worldly for them.
22) 18) dialog: I’m just telling you, Valle will make things easier.
22) 22) dialog: A sound compromise.
24) 5) dialog: Tony! Lip turns to see Shirley at the end of the aisle of parke cars.
24) 12) dialog: I’ve been looking for you.
24) 14) dialog: If you need extra money, next time, ask me.
24) 16) dialog: What if you lost?
24) 18) dialog: And stooping down in the gravel throwing dice for pocket change makes you a winner?
24) 20) dialog: They didn’t have a choice whether to be inside or out. You did. This hits a nerve with Lip. (CONTINUED)
24) 23) dialog: Let’s go. And wipe your knees, you've got dirt on them. Shirley gets in, pulls the car door shut. Lip, embarrasse brushes the dirt off his pants.
26) 1) dialog: Who is this?
26) 3) dialog: On the radio.
26) 5) dialog: This is Little Richard?
26) 7) dialog: (of course he could) I don’t know. Sounds very complicated. Shirley lowers his book.
26) 8) dialog: So where did this “Tony the Lip” moniker come from?
26) 12) dialog: Why are you smiling?
26) 14) dialog: You don’t mind that your friends-- the people closest to you--consider you a liar?
26) 16) dialog: What’s the difference?
26) 18) dialog: And you’re proud of that? Lip shrugs, smiles.
28) 2) dialog: Of course I’ve heard of him, I just never heard his music. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
28) 5) dialog: But I like this. He’s got a silky voice... smooth.
28) 7) dialog: Eyes on the road please. Lip flips the station. Aretha Franklin’s Won’t Be Long PL
28) 9) dialog: I don’t think so... Lip looks back at Dr. Shirley in disbelief.

Oleg and George also get o of their car, stretch, smoke.

Lip goes to the box of stones, picks up a few, checks the out, puts them back. Oleg WATCHES AS Lip spot a large JADE-COLORED STONE on th ground. He picks it up, looks it over...

Lip gets in, starts the car. (CONTINUED)
29) 3) dialog: Before we pull out, Tony, we need to talk. I just heard something that disturbed me a great deal. I gave you petty cash.
29) 5) dialog: Oleg told me what you did.
29) 7) dialog: You stole a jade stone from the store.
29) 9) dialog: He watched you do it.
29) 11) dialog: You picked it up and you put it in your pocket.
29) 13) dialog: Why would you pick up a rock off the ground?
29) 15) dialog: (frustrated) But why would you want a regular rock?
29) 19) dialog: A lucky rock? Let me see it. Reluctantly, Lip pulls out the JADE STONE.
29) 20) dialog: I want you to go back and pay for it. Lip is embarrassed, angry.
29) 22) dialog: Pay for the stone, Tony, you’ll feel better.
29) 24) dialog: Do not drive, Mr. Vallelonga. Lip stops, puts it in park. They sit in silence. Finally. Lip gets out, SLAMS the door, storms off. Shirley waits. few moments later, Lip gets back in the car, throws it in drive.
29) 25) dialog: Feel better?
29) 27) dialog: Tony, if you’d like, I will happily buy you that stone.
31) 0) text: Dr. Shirley’s fingers tinkle the ivories on a Steinway, performing “HAPPY TALK” to a sold-out house. CLOSE ON THE WING OF THE STAGE where Lip is listening to music, satisfied. The Stage Manager stands a few feet bac from him, looking sheepish and a little scared.
33) 2) dialog: Not really.
33) 4) dialog: It’s a long story, Tony.
33) 8) dialog: I have a brother somewhere. We used to get together once ina while...but it got more and more difficult to keep in touch. That’s the curse of being a musician-- you're always on the road, like a carnival worker, or a criminal. (beat) It took a toll on my marriage as well. Lip glances in the rear-view mirror.
33) 10) dialog: Was. They drive for a moment.
34) 1) dialog: June was a good person--terrible grammar, but a kind soul. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the constitution to do a husband act as well as a concert pianist act. I couldn’t balance both worlds.
37) 4) dialog: I'm fine. Thank you.
38) 2) dialog: I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone with your appetite.
38) 4) dialog: I’ve never had fried chicken in my life.
38) 6) dialog: You have a very narrow assessment of me, Tony.
38) 8) dialog: What? No. No, you’re not good, you're bad. I’m saying, just because other negro people listen to a certain kind of music doesn’t mean I have to. Nor do we all have to eat the same food. (CONTINUED)
38) 10) dialog: You're missing the point. For you to make the assumption that--
38) 12) dialog: No. another big, juicy bite.
38) 14) dialog: It smells okay, but I don’t want to get grease on my blanket.
38) 17) dialog: No.
38) 19) dialog: Don’t you dare!
38) 23) dialog: How? Do you even have utensils? Plates?
38) 25) dialog: I can’t do that.
38) 27) dialog: I... I really can’t do this.
38) 30) dialog: I just... this seems so... so unsanitary.
38) 33) dialog: What do we do about the bones?
39) 2) dialog: This is the place. The guys get out of the car. Lip takes Shirley’s bag out the trunk.
40) 4) dialog: Um... no, thank you.
40) 6) dialog: I... I'd rather not.
40) 9) dialog: I’m just... I’m on my way out to meet a friend. Shirley drains his scotch, stands, and WALKS INTO THE NIG INT. LIP’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT CLOSE ON BEDSIDE TABLE where we see a wallet, a pack of smokes, and, surprisingly, the JADE ROCK that we thought had returned. PULL BACK to reveal Lip, in boxers, sitting up in bed, flipping through the GREEN BOOK. He puts the book aside a moment, opens a pizza box on the beside him. He takes out the ENTIRE UNCUT PIZZA, FOLDS IT HALF AND TAKES A BITE. (CONTINUED)
42) 7) dialog: (slurring) I just came in for a drink.
43) 2) dialog: (still slurry) I apologize for putting you in that position, Tony. (CONTINUED)
43) 6) dialog: I needed some air.
43) 8) dialog: Does the geography really matter?
43) 10) dialog: If I walked into a bar in your neighborhood, would this conversation be any different? Lip dodges the question.
43) 12) dialog: Tony...Do you really have a gun?
44) 1) dialog: Thank you, Louisville, for your warm hospitality! 60.
46) 2) dialog: Not buttah... butter. Say the “er.”
46) 4) dialog: “So Betty bought a bit of better butter to make the bitter butter better...”
46) 6) dialog: Don’t be lazy--enunciate. “So Betty bought a bit of better butter...”
46) 8) dialog: No, you need to start somewhere. Athletes stretch to warm up before an event. A singer does vocal exercises. These drills will strengthen your speech muscles. WE HEAR A NASTY “PING” FROM THE ENGINE O.S. STEAM rises f under the hood, splashes against the windshield.

50) 4) dialog: I’d rather not use that. (CONTINUED)
50) 8) dialog: I understand. But I’m not going in there. There’s an awkward standoff.
50) 9) dialog: I could go back and use the facilities at my motel, but... that’s going to take at least a half an hour. Anderson considers this for a BEAT, then gives a friendly smile.
51) 2) dialog: Animals go in the woods.
51) 4) dialog: So let’s just get there so I can go back and finish the show.
51) 6) dialog: I’m aware. (CONTINUED)
51) 10) dialog: No? Who does? Lip gets the subtext.
51) 12) dialog: Eyes on the road.
51) 14) dialog: Eyes on the road.
52) 0) text: Show's over, GUESTS are departing. As Dr. Shirley accepts congratulations out on the steps, Lip stands by the Cadil smoking with George.
52) 14) dialog: What on God’s green earth are you doing?
52) 16) dialog: Looks more like a piecemeal ransom note. (CONTINUED)
52) 19) dialog: May I? Lip reluctantly hands him the letter.
52) 20) dialog: (reading aloud) “Dear, Dolores--I’m meeting all the highly leading citizens of the town, people who use big words, all of them, but you know me, I get by, I’m a good bullshitter.” (to Lip) Two “t"s in “bullshitter.” (continues reading) “As I’m writing this letter, I’m eating potato chips and I’m starting to get thirsty. I washed my socks last night and dried them on the TV. I should have brung the iron." (to Lip) You know this is pathetic, right? Lip shrugs, embarrassed.
52) 21) dialog: Tell me what you’re trying to say. Lip looks up.
52) 23) dialog: Then tell her that. But try to say it in a manner that no one has ever said it.
52) 26) dialog: And without profanity. Shirley gives the letter back to Lip, then starts to pace (CONTINUED)
52) 29) dialog: Put this down. “Dolores, when I think of you, I’m reminded of the beautiful plains of Iowa.” Lip stares at him.
52) 30) dialog: Put it down. Lip starts to write.
52) 32) dialog: Plains of Iowa.
52) 34) dialog: The plains. P-L-A-I-N-S. Those big fields we saw.
52) 36) dialog: (annoyed) Tony, no expounding. Lip looks up, confused.
52) 38) dialog: Just write what I say. Shirley keeps pacing as he thinks.
52) 39) dialog: “The distance between us is breaking my spirit... My time and experiences without you are meaningless to me.” (CONTINUED)
52) 43) dialog: Now this... “Falling in love with you was the easiest thing I have ever done.” Eyes glued to the page, Lip SCRIBBLES AWAY FURIOUSLY.
52) 47) dialog: Is it okay if I say, “P.S., kiss the kids”? Shirley breaks from his trance.
52) 48) dialog: 
52) 53) dialog: That's like clanging a cowbell at the end of Shostakovich’s 7th. Lip nods as if he knows what Shirley’s talking about.
52) 55) dialog: It’s perfect, Tony. Lip smiles and writes...
53) 2) dialog: He does?
53) 11) dialog: Thanks. I’1l just be a moment.
53) 14) dialog: I beg your pardon? The Tailor takes the suit from him.
57) 0) text: Policeman #1 enters the locker room followed by Lip. Dr. Shirley, BRUISED, is handcuffed, sitting on the floor naked (also seen from the side). His skin still wet from steam room and sweat. Next to him also naked and cuffed t the radiator, is a WHITE MAN. Policeman #1 walks Lip over to POLICEMAN #2, African American.
58) 1) dialog: (subdued) They were wrong for the way they treated me, and you rewarded them. We see that Shirley’s eye is bruised, his lip slightly swollen.
58) 3) dialog: I just wish you hadn’t paid them off.
58) 5) dialog: Okay, Tony, quit your phony altruism and concern for my career.
58) 9) dialog: You were only thinking about yourself back there, because you know if I miss a show, it comes out of your pocket.
58) 11) dialog: (calmly) I assumed you would want this to be the exception. Lip gets in the car without opening Shirley’s door. Shirl stands alone a moment, then opens his own door.
61) 2) dialog: I’m fine.
61) 4) dialog: I said I’m fine. 76.
65) 1) dialog: Where are you going? Lip turns to see Shirley behind him in the hallway.
65) 3) dialog: (in Italian) To meet your friend, Dominic? (CONTINUED)
65) 6) dialog: (in Italian) Before you decide whether or not to take him up on the job offer, I think we should have a word. Lip realizes that Shirley understood the earlier conversa
65) 7) dialog: (in English) Tony, I think you’re doing a wonderful job. Lip shrugs, not used to Shirley being so solicitous.
65) 8) dialog: So I would like to formally offer you the position of my road manager. With the title comes more responsibility and, of course, there will be a raise in pay. Lip thinks about it.
65) 11) dialog: Tony... Lip stops, looks to Shirley.
65) 12) dialog: Sorry about last night. Lip nods. (CONTINUED)
66) 0) text: Dr. Shirley and Lip sit at a table in the lobby. Shirley pours them both a drink from a bottle of Cutty Sark.
66) 2) dialog: My mother. She taught me how to play on an old spinet. Soon as I could walk, we’d travel around the Florida panhandle and I'd put on little shows in parishes and halls. A man who had seen me play arranged for me to study at the Leningrad Conservatory of Music.
66) 4) dialog: Actually, I was trained to play classical music. Brahms, Franz Liszt, Chopin--it’s all I ever wanted to play. (smile fades) But I was persuaded by my record company to pursue a career in popular music instead. They told me audiences would never accept a black pianist on the classical stage. Wanted to turn me into just another “colored entertainer.” You know, the guy who smokes while he’s playing, who puts a glass of whisky on the piano and then gets mad when he’s not respected like Arthur Rubinstein. Well, you don’t see Arthur Rubenstein smoking and putting a drink on his piano. (CONTINUED)
66) 8) dialog: A mistake? Performing the music I trained my entire life to play?
66) 10) dialog: Thank you, Tony. (beat) But...not everyone can play Chopin...not the way I can.

In the b.g., we see the guys--Grandp Nicola and Anthony, Louie, Rudy, Johnny--at the kitchen t PLAYING CARDS.
67) 20) dialog: (admonishing) Tony... As they drive off, we ANGLE ON Shirley, who cracks a tiny --SHIRLEY’S CADILLAC DRIVES THROUGH A RURAL LANDSCAPE DUS WITH SNOW.
72) 1) dialog: Excuse me! (no response) Excuse me, sirs. I quite understand why my associate is being held, but what exactly am I being charged with? Not a glance in his direction. (CONTINUED)
72) 4) dialog: You seem like reasonable men--can you let me out so we might discuss the situation please?
72) 6) dialog: You cannot hold me without cause!
72) 8) dialog: I want to speak to a lawyer, I want my phone call! This is a flagrant violation of my rights! I demand my phone call immediately! The younger officer looks to the Chief, uncomfortable.
73) 1) dialog: As my mother always said, “What kind of brand new fool are you?!” Lip doesn’t respond.
73) 2) dialog: Look out there, Tony. Take a good look at the officer you hit. Lip doesn’t move.
73) 3) dialog: Look at him. Lip raises his eyes. HIS POV - Patrolman #1 is sitting in the bullpen, drinkin coffee, horsing around with the other cops.
73) 4) dialog: He’s having a grand old time, chatting up his pals, having a nice cup of coffee. And where are you? In here. With me. Who did nothing. Yet I’m the one who’s paying the price. I’m the one who’s going to miss the Birmingham show.
73) 6) dialog: So your little temper tantrum...was it worth it? (beat) You don’t win with violence, Tony, you win when you maintain your dignity. Dignity always prevails. And tonight, because of you, we did not. The station PHONE RINGS and Patrolman #2 answers.
75) 2) dialog: It’s not great--it’s not great at all--it’s humiliating. Lip glances in the rear-view.
75) 4) dialog: And I just put the Attorney General of the United States in an incredibly awkward position.
75) 8) dialog: That man and his brother are trying to change this country--that’s what else he’s got to do! Now he thinks I’m garbage. Calling from some backwoods swamp jail, asking if he can help attenuate assault charges... who does that? Garbage, that’s who. This stings Lip.
75) 9) dialog: You_shouldn’t have hit him!
75) 11) dialog: Please. You hit him because of what he called you. I’ve had to listen to that kind of talk my entire life, you should be able to take it for one night.
75) 13) dialog: You're blacker than me?
75) 15) dialog: So knowing who Little Richard is makes you blacker than me? I wish you could hear yourself sometimes, Tony--you wouldn’t talk as much. (CONTINUED)
75) 19) dialog: Pull over.
75) 21) dialog: Pull! Over!
75) 23) dialog: 
76) 0) text: Lip steers the car to the side of the road. Shirley opens door, gets out in the rain. Lip looks out the window as Dr. Shirley walks down the drenched, muddy road.
76) 5) dialog: Yes, I live in a castle! Alone. And rich white folks let me play piano for them, because it makes them feel cultured. But when I walk off that stage I go right back to being another nigger to them--because that is their true culture. And I suffer that slight alone, because I’m not accepted by my own people, because I’m not like them either! So if I’m not black enough, and I’m not white enough, and I’m not man enough, what _am I?!
77) 1) dialog: I need sleep.
77) 3) dialog: No. No. I refuse to stay at an establishment that doesn’t want me.
79) 1) dialog: You realize you're going to be home before that letter gets there?
79) 3) dialog: Give it here, I'll fix it. Shirley reaches for the letter, but Lip pulls it away.
79) 5) dialog: (reading) “Dear Dolores, sometimes you remind me of a house.” Shirley glances at Lip... what the hell?
79) 6) dialog: (reading) "RK house with beautiful lights on it where everyone inside is happy.” Shirley hands the letter back to Lip.
79) 7) dialog: Yeah, you got it. Shirley gets in bed, tries to sleep. We hear O.S. cars; occasionally a dog barks in the distance.
79) 9) dialog: Yes? (CONTINUED)
79) 13) dialog: He knows where I am if he wants to reconnect. Lip nods. He puts his letter down, turns out the light.
79) 16) dialog: Hmmm?
79) 18) dialog: Good night, Tony.
82) 2) dialog: Thank you, Mr. Kindell. This is Tony Vallelonga.
83) 2) dialog: Thank you.
84) 7) dialog: Go ahead. I’1l meet you there.
85) 13) dialog: This gentleman’s saying I can’t dine here.
85) 20) dialog: No. I don’t. In 45 minutes I’1l be entertaining your guests up on that stage, but I can’t eat here? Graham Kindell shifts uncomfortably.
85) 25) dialog: No. I’m not eating in a dressing room. There's a brief standoff. (CONTINUED)
85) 31) dialog: No. Not this time. I’m eating in this room or I’m not playing. Kindell’s frustration grows.
86) 16) dialog: Stop! They turn to see Shirley in the doorway. Graham Kindell p away from Lip, fixes his collar.
86) 17) dialog: It’s all right, Tony. I’1l play... if you want me to. Graham Kindell SIGHS, clearly relieved. Lip is relieved, But only for a moment. Something comes over him. He glanc at Kindell, then back at Shirley. Lip finally sees the bi picture, and realizes that, for him and Shirley, this is moment of truth. Then...
88) 1) dialog: You hungry?
90) 4) dialog: Two Cutty’s, neat. Shirley takes out a BIG WAD OF CASH. A couple DRUNKS at t bar take notice.
90) 6) dialog: Whatever your specialty is, we’ll take it. She CALLS back toward the kitchen:
90) 13) dialog: Nothing important.
91) 1) dialog: If we leave right now, I think you can make it.
91) 3) dialog: Christmas Eve. Lip stops walking, holds his hand in front of Shirley. Li reaches behind his back, PULLS OUT A GUN, SHOOTS INTO THE AIR. (CONTINUED)
91) 7) dialog: I knew you had a gun!
93) 2) dialog: Yes, it’s a shame we don’t have something to protect us on our journey. Dr. Shirley thinks, then SNAPS his fingers.
93) 3) dialog: Why don’t you put your lucky rock up on the dash, Tony? Lip stares at him in the mirror for a LONG BEAT. Finally, reaches in his pocket, pulls out the JADE STONE THAT WE THOUGHT HE HAD RETURNED, places it on the dash.
