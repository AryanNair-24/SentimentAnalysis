His arms are attached by metal cuffs and ch to fastening points in the floor, But there is enough sla the chains to allow him to stand if he wished. Doctor Isaacs, another SCIENTIST and a LAB TECH stand ove Undead. Strangely the Undead does not seem disturbed by t presence. He makes no attempt to attack them. Instead he focussed on the items placed on the table before him. The things from everyday life -- A digital camera. A cell phone. A child's toy. The Raiders Undead goes for the cell phone first. He pick up with surprising dexterity. Regards it for a moment, th holds it to his ear.

We see the pic of the surprised looking Scientist on its tiny VIEWING SC Then the Undead reaches for the child's toy. It is a plas cube with square, round and triangular holes into which corresponding plastic shapes must be placed. As the Raide Undead picks up the first of the plastic pieces, we see t distinctive three marks at the base of his neck - where D Isaacs had injected him.

31) 14) dialog: No ... Please! But the door SLAMS, sealing his fate. The Undead is on hi an instant. Slamming the Lab Tech to the floor and DEVOUR him with a savage, terrifying hunger that we have never s before.
