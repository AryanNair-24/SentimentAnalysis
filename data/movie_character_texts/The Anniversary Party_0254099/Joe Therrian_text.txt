A large room with hard wood floors, dominated by a huge fireplace.  The dining room on one side, living room on t other.  Floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch garden pool... The house is classic Neutra.  All GLASS an SMOOTH LINES. The calm is broken by the telephone.  Joe and Sally ignor until the answering machine picks up.  They break their y poses and listen. The CAMERA hovers over the answering machine.

2) 6) text: Mr. Joe, we have to have the house.  If you please now... JOE
2) 7) text: It's yours. The CAMERA glances off photos of the couple: portraits an candids, their wedding day, with friends, on vacation, tumbling on the lawn, and the like. Some framed and hung, some taped to the fridge or simply leaning on a shelf.  It's clear that at least a handful a by the same photographer, black and whites, grainy and beautiful. There are lots of photos of Joe and his sister Lucy, documenting their relationship from childhood.  There's a ANNIE LEIBOWITZ photo-shoot of Sally carelessly displayed somewhere.

3) 36) text: You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left. Sally's started the bath, and is watching him from the doorway.  He meets her eyes mid-sentence. JOE (CONT'D)
3) 37) text: Oh?  I don't think tonight.  I'm sure they're well behaved.  All our friends have dogs, and they always want to bring them.  We'd be outnumbered, you see?  So we sort of put a ban on it.  Sorry. He rolls his eyes.  Sally walks back into the bathroom, s isn't buying it. JOE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

7) 15) text: I understand you won the Booker Prize. JOE
7) 17) text: Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find? JOE
7) 19) text: I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long... JOE
7) 21) text: Don't be silly. JOE
7) 23) text: Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that -- JOE
7) 25) text: You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you. JOE

8) 89) text: The gate was open? JOE
8) 98) text: I did it. JOE (comes on them with the Forsythes in tow)

9) 40) text: What a nose.  You missed your calling. JOE
9) 42) text: Sally? JOE
9) 44) text: He's impossible.  Go on then. Joe rips open the gift.  It's a framed black and white of Joe, Sally and Otis lying on the couch.  It's clear which photos in the house are Gina's.  It's a breathtaking prin an amazing caught moment.  All light and shadow.  A touch study. SALLY (CONT'D) (respectful of the talent)

13) 25) text: When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual... JOE
13) 27) text: You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director. There's a long moment. JOE (finally)
14) 6) text: She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours. SALLY
14) 31) text: I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself. Joe enters the kitchen, watches. SALLY
14) 33) text: Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman. Joe winces, uncomfortable, picks up the bottle of wine an leaves. SKYE (CONT'D)

20) 1) text: Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&amp;B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red. JOE
20) 3) text: Sally did all this herself? JOE
20) 5) text: Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe. JOE
20) 8) text: Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't. JOE
20) 10) text: I'm a little nervous, so... JOE
20) 12) text: A little out of my element. JOE
20) 14) text: Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction. JOE
20) 16) text: I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating. JOE
20) 18) text: I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort. JOE
20) 20) text: But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism... JOE (pissed)
20) 22) text: The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly. JOE
20) 24) text: And Ryan works at home. JOE
20) 25) text: And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you. Her eyes well with tears. JOE (CONT'D)
20) 27) text: Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually. JOE

35) 21) text: And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death. JOE
35) 23) text: Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place. JOE
