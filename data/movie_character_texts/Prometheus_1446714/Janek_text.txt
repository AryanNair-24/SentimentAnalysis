21) 5) dialog: Zeta Two Reticuli was surveyed already. A hundred years ago.
21) 10) dialog: No Earthlike planets.
21) 14) dialog: So what are you looking for?
21) 21) dialog: Your ticket. I'll put the ship where you want. Run your scans.
21) 25) dialog: Better for discipline. (off their silence) Men ship out as prospectors for one reason: the percentage. Find a gold mine or a habitable planet, and you're set for life. (he laughs bitterly) But this contract says no percentage. No bounty. Just triple pay. The men aren't happy.
21) 29) dialog: I'm always unhappy.
22) 115) dialog: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
22) 118) dialog: Is that the question you've come light- years to answer?
24) 4) dialog: Welcome to Zeta Two Reticuli. Edge of the system. Open her eyes.
26) 3) dialog: Overlay.
26) 14) dialog: Director. Good of you to join us.
26) 18) dialog: Just getting warmed up.
26) 23) dialog: Man knows what he wants. Run it.
28) 23) dialog: That is all.
28) 27) dialog: Downs. You heard the man.
33) 3) dialog: Well, we just rang the doorbell, if anybody's listening.
44) 6) dialog: There's only six hours of daylight left. Maybe you should hold off.
48) 3) dialog: Son of a bitch. They were right.
52) 6) dialog: Director. Taking an interest?
58) 3) dialog: All hands. Back to the ship. We got a mean storm front rolling in. I repeat. All hands... 45.
60) 3) dialog: Holloway! I got two-hundred-kilometer winds with airborne silica and enough static to fry your suits. Get your asses back here! Now!
64) 3) dialog: Between the wind speeds and the static electricity, there's no safe way to get to you. You're going to have to hunker down until it passes. How are your provisions?
64) 7) dialog: Honey sacks? 48.
66) 4) dialog: Maybe next time you'll mind your maps. Keep your heads down. We'll come get you in the morning.
66) 7) dialog: Magellan out.
66) 18) dialog: To Milburn and Fifield. The first human beings to freak out, get lost, and sleep in their suits in the ruins of an alien civilization.
73) 28) dialog: 
76) 16) dialog: We should be getting beacons off their suits.
76) 22) dialog: Both suits?
76) 77) dialog: Where's the rest of him? 64.
76) 82) dialog: All right. We're done here. All hands back aboard.
76) 87) dialog: We can't bring the body aboard. God knows what's in there. Bag him. We'll put him in an ore hopper.
77) 20) dialog: I've just lost a third of my crew. I'm not sending any more men off into the dark.
77) 24) dialog: Get Vickers to lend you some soldiers.
78) 3) dialog: Put him in the number one ore hopper. Get the scrubbers on in the airlock. Sterilize everything.
84) 3) dialog: I didn't think I'd see you again. You know we lost two men.
84) 11) dialog: Of course.
84) 115) dialog: Take care of her. Get her a sedative. Downs. Get Holloway into a freezer. Everybody else with me.
87) 4) dialog: All right! Listen up. I expect you all know what...
87) 7) dialog: We've got some kind of parasite aboard ship.
87) 26) dialog: We're a modular ship. Self-contained life-support and power in every section. I say put the ship in orbit. Vent every compartment to space. Sit in vacuum at twenty degrees Kelvin for a week. Kill anything.
87) 35) dialog: Are you serious?
87) 39) dialog: We're barely here three days and three men dead!
87) 43) dialog: Careless!
91) 26) dialog: Brick. What you got?
93) 4) dialog: All hands, duty stations. Ready for flight. The Magellan is lifting.
93) 15) dialog: What is it?
93) 20) dialog: What have you done to my ship?
97) 6) dialog: God damn it!
103) 52) dialog: Vickers said you were dead.
103) 57) dialog: So there's two of these things on my ship now.
103) 76) dialog: What happened to you?
103) 80) dialog: Why?
103) 97) dialog: DAVID crippled the Nav computer. I'm trying to lay a course in by hand. Never done it. I'm not sure anyone ever has on a ship like this. We can't lift until DAVID lets us.
105) 37) dialog: I'll stay. 97.
114) 12) dialog: Thank you. 108.
114) 19) dialog: The others...?
114) 25) dialog: We're not a gunship.
114) 30) dialog: Get your helmet on.
114) 35) dialog: You'll have to be my hands. (stares out at the storm) You're sure about this.
114) 40) dialog: All right. 109.
114) 44) dialog: Red lever. Landing engines main.
116) 3) dialog: Take the stick. Throttle up, stick forward.
120) 3) dialog: Stick back! Hard! 110.
120) 9) dialog: Harder!
120) 14) dialog: We can't catch that.
