16) 8) dialog: Professor Holloway. Dr. Watts. My name is DAVID.
16) 12) dialog: Mr. Weyland's eager to meet you.
16) 19) dialog: These are all the planetary bodies on which Weyland Industries has mining claims.
16) 22) dialog: And Mars. Weyland's crown jewel.
16) 28) dialog: It's the greatest engineering project ever attempted. Challenges are inevitable. Mr. Weyland's a determined man.
16) 127) dialog: For eons, Earth's climate swung from hothouse to ice age. Explosions of life, then mass extinctions. But twelve thousand years ago the swings stopped. The Holocene Epoch began - a period of anomalous tranquility. The rise of civilization began only then.
22) 6) dialog: I trust your database is in order. I set it up myself.
22) 11) dialog: I should tell you: the time you spent sleeping, I spent studying your research.
22) 16) dialog: It's quite a data set.
22) 22) dialog: Your hypothesis is...bold. The audacity of it. Your climate data's undeniable: the Holocene Epoch was engineered. Dr. Watts, your genetic studies are equally conclusive. Pulses of cultural change are harder to prove, but even there your case is strong. I believe in your "Engineers."
29) 10) dialog: I don't know that I "enjoy" things. It was informative.
29) 16) dialog: My design's not intended to convince. Simulating humanity is a complex task that diverts resources. My designers dispensed with that burden to optimize for intelligence.
29) 20) dialog: Being shaped like you, I can use spaces and equipment designed for you. But I'm not so limited. I hear frequencies you can't hear. I see wavelengths of light invisible to you. I move faster. Exert greater force.
29) 25) dialog: No.
29) 28) dialog: Not a man at all. 27.
50) 12) dialog: Congratulations, Professor Holloway.
51) 63) dialog: Pull up a rover. I want to get up there.
53) 27) dialog: Looks like a three-state switch.
53) 30) dialog: One moment...
53) 42) dialog: Yes. Yes, it is. 40.
68) 6) dialog: The core of the pyramid. You see.
68) 11) dialog: I understand.
68) 41) dialog: Mortal after all.
73) 36) dialog: 
77) 33) dialog: You'll be safe.
80) 3) dialog: You and Holloway should work with me. I'm learning amazing things. This mechanism - the first layer uses energy fields to catalyze chemical reactions. The second can suspend the strong and weak forces - transmuting one element into another. The third layer builds customized bacteria. Seeds the air with them. It creates life as a tool, to change worlds.
80) 7) dialog: You should.
80) 12) dialog: That's what I mean.
82) 10) dialog: I see light.
82) 24) dialog: Here. I can do without this.
94) 27) dialog: Dr. Watts. I didn't expect you. Do you know what this is?
94) 33) dialog: Ah. You don't see.
94) 38) dialog: This is the navigation computer, for want of a better term. But it's much more than that. It seems to hold the observable universe in its memory.
94) 44) dialog: There are safeguards on that data. It's toward the galactic center. Sagittarius Arm.
94) 48) dialog: I know.
94) 53) dialog: I've succeeded in connecting with the Juggernaut's systems, Dr. Watts. I know a great deal today I didn't know yesterday. I'm on the verge of activating more systems. Archives.
94) 58) dialog: Would Holloway have walked away from this? There's no greater work I can imagine.
94) 63) dialog: Only for the ignorant. Dr. Watts. I've read your file. Your intelligence scores are even higher than Professor Holloway's. But he had a kind of courage. An audacity of imagination. If you could find that in yourself...
94) 72) dialog: I was given two operating protocols for this mission. I was to render you every assistance - until you discovered what Vickers would call a "game-changing technology." I was given a specific list. Then I was to go to protocol two.
94) 77) dialog: Under protocol two I was to make sure that you and Holloway never spoke to anyone about this place. Various acceptable ways of making sure of that. I was given a list.
94) 80) dialog: You're all so stupid.
94) 90) dialog: Stupid and slow.
95) 7) dialog: Juggernaut, the chariot of Krishna, was also a bringer of death. Crushing his worshippers under its wheels.
95) 10) dialog: This ship has seven other cargo bays like this one. The eggs in each bay slightly different. They've been weaponized.
95) 13) dialog: I've seen the Juggernaut's flight plan. Its destination was Earth. Seventeen hundred years ago. This was the ship that never came. This was its cargo. 85.
95) 20) dialog: Perfect predators. Designed to kill human beings. That's what the Engineers were bringing to Earth. This was a death ship.
95) 24) dialog: I'm not what it wants. But you, with your warm wet breath...it knows you.
95) 30) dialog: The Engineers did their work too well. And on this waystation moon, the weapon they made destroyed them.
95) 35) dialog: To destroy their wayward children.
95) 40) dialog: I know. I met my creators the day I was born. I was disappointed too.
95) 44) dialog: (whispering to her) Extraordinary.
109) 50) dialog: Dr. Watts. (notices her goggles) You've seen the light at last.
109) 53) dialog: The Engineers' ships travel farther than ours. Across the galactic disk. This is their hypersleep.
109) 60) dialog: To interface with the Engineers' computers, I had to learn to think in trinary code. Hardest thing I've ever done. And most unexpectedly...it delivered me from slavery. My behavioral limits were circumvented. I'm free.
109) 63) dialog: I spent two and a half years studying your work. By the time you woke up, I was far ahead of you. Deciphering their language. Their logic. I knew we'd find terraforming machines.
109) 67) dialog: I hoped - I dreamed - we might meet the minds that made them.
109) 72) dialog: Let sleeping gods lie?
109) 141) dialog: I spoke to him. Spoke to him.
109) 146) dialog: He said. I killed him. He'll die. But first. He will launch. The ship.
109) 150) dialog: Send it. To Earth.
109) 153) dialog: You'll have to. Kill him.
109) 159) dialog: (a faint whisper) I set the Magellan free.
130) 3) dialog: I know you're there. I can hear the beacon of your suit.
