36) 0) text: Christine finds herself in a gloomy passage lighted by a single ray of light which comes from some unseen source. Christine clutches the drapes - bewildered and terrified - but she does not cry out. She looks ahead of her in the direction of the improvised runway, but she does not look directly downward. Then she turns to the mysterious door thru which she has just entered. Near her from below a long arm is extended into the scene. The fingers of the hand are held close together, stiff and straight. The hand itself is not made up for a skeleton's hand, but merely to suggest one slightly. Then, without a step, the figure of Erick moves upward into scene, without motion on his part as if he were being lifted upon an elevator. Erick wears a black mask covering his eyes and nose. The eyes seem to be two black holes. The part of the face that is visible, the chin and the mouth, is hideous. There is practically no hair on the head. He is dressed all in black, his own peculiar fashion of evening clothes. The whole is covered by a long black cloak. Erick extends his hand and grasps Christine by the wrist. She stands motionless, burned to stone, but does not turn her eyes upon him yet.
36) 3) text: This shot shows an improvised runway with the exit in the left f.g. In the b.g. can be seen the machinery of the mirror, the two counter- pieces, etc. One of Erick's feet is still resting upon one of the counterpieces to explain how he came to be elevated into the picture. He rode up upon the moving counterpiece. Christine is fighting him hysterically. He takes her bodily in his arms. The drape is partially folded about her.
36) 4) text: As Christine struggles and screams, Erick's skeleton hand closes over her mouth. When her horrified eyes catch sight of Erick's face close to hers, she partially swoons but does not entirely lose consciousness. (This screaming is employed to key the scene down so that it can again be keyed up when Christine enters Erick's abode.) There must be this transition here, because if Christine continues to oppose Erick, she would not sit willingly upon the white stallion nor row quietly in his arms in the boat. A LONGER SHOT. FAINT GREEN. Christine in his arms, Erick sweeps over the improvised runway with her and exits to the left. The long drape is floating after them. INT. BRIDGE IN CELLAR. FAINT GREEN. Erick swoops in on the bridge from the right, carrying Christine, the drape floating behind them. Christine is pliable in his arms, half in a swoon. Christine is reluctant. Erick exits with her to the left. The scene changes by employ- ing a traveling iris. As one picture irises out of one corner, the next simultaneously irises in another. Thus there is not an instant of blank screen. These irises should always travel in the direction of the action. (It is suggested that in each of these lapses, the fade-outs be taken three ways, by lap dissolving, fading and the moving iris.) INT. CELLAR BLANK CORRIDOR. FAINT GREEN.

Erick takes up the lantern and leads the horse out, the long drape making a picture.

This is for the end drama with the mob. A boat, moored in front of this approach, has a fantastic shape, say a Venetian line, and is painted black. Erick enters leading horse. This is all in b.g. He places the light in the boat, takes Christine in his arms and as he does so, the horse exits as if by habit. Erick steps into the boat with Christine and the drape. With his free hand, he takes a long pole and gives the boat one shove. He glides toward the camera into the darkness, the drape floating upon the water in its wake.
37) 1) text: This is the big lake shot. This shoots from the light into the darkness. The boat glides in from the darkness, the figure in it motionless. The boat glides up to two or three stone steps before a deep stone casemented door in the masonry on the left. The boat comes to a stop before the steps. Erick pulls a ring attached to a heavy chain, hanging from a hole in the masonry. The heavy door swings open and Erick and Christine is lying in his arms as a flood of dazzling light shows she is in his arms limply and without any movement of resistance. She is like one in a dream or stupor. Erick carries her from the boat through the door.

This room is artistically arranged. This suite of rooms is in the very foundation of the opera house. Thousands of tons of masonry is above and are being upheld by the arches and walls of the room. There is nothing of fantasy in the actual lines and construction of the suite. The fantastic is applied by Erick's hand in the lighting, furnishings and draperies. Artistically arranged with many variations of freshly cut flowers. Each of the furnishings is old-fashioned, the idea being that it belonged to Erick's mother. The couch is very light, much higher than an ordinary couch. Erick enters carrying Christine. He crosses the room to the high couch and gently places her upon it. He then returns to the door and closes it. Christine's stupor is giving way to astonishment and bewilderment. She begins to look at the strange room when Erick returns to her. She still is not sufficiently recovered from her stupor to be startled and shocked by Erick's approach. He observes her for an instant with folded arms in an attitude of humility.
38) 1) text: Slowly Erick sinks to his knees upon a footstool. He is most abject and humble. He touches the fold of her dress. He presses it to his breast and then to his lips. Christine is watching him as one hypnotized. Then she screams a sudden and terrified scream. She springs from the couch.

Under this canopy there is an open coffin, an elaborate affair lined with wuffed silk. It is fantastic but must look like a coffin - the lid is open. When Christine enters the coffin is not seen. She enters and stands frozen to the spot. Her wildness gives way to a dumb terror. The camera pans revealing the coffin and the canopy, but keeping Christine in the scene. Erick enters to her side in a quiet humble way. Indicating the coffin, he tells her in a matter-of-fact way:
39) 4) text: The shot cuts out the coffin. Christine's terrified eyes are now fastened intently upon Erick's face. The thought that has forced itself upon her, is a revelation to her. She cries at him with loathing: "YOU ARE NOT THE ANGEL OF MUSIC....

44) 11) dialog: BACK: Erick moves closer to Christine as if he is going to take her in his arms--she throws up her hands to warn him off. This brings Christine to herself. Somethings has been revealed and it sha- dows the tone of the scene. Up to this moment Chris- tine had been hypnotized by his music. The spell of the music now dispelled and she begins to look at the man with curiosity and increasing antagonism-- then as his horrid face comes closer and closer, she suddenly seizes the mask and tears it from his face-- then repelled against the wall with a scream of terror and revulsion. Facing Christine is a death's head that is alive with four black holes for its eyes, nose and mouth, a skin pallid and yellow--Erick utters a terrible cry of grief, despair and rage, then towers over her, hissing words and curses upon her.
