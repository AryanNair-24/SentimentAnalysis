In case you've forgotten we're here at a wedding. We're here to celebrate union and possibility and joy. And I don't know anybody that does it better than Al Green. Instead of dulling our senses or moving faster than we really feel like moving, isn't it nice to slow to a gentle pace where we can appreciate gazing into another persons eyes who loves you like you's like to love yourself.

30) 19) dialog: No, that wasn't me. That was Al Green. I just sang it, I mean I'd love to write a song like that. One that people hear with their cells, you know, and they say, "Hey, I've felt what that guy has felt." I used to think I could do that, but now I'm not so sure.
