Flames consume the backseat. Smoke spills out the windows. The radio still plays, however: The Band's "I Sh be Released." One of the Mustang's front tires has blown out. Scraps of black rubber litter the accident scene. As the camera pulls in, we see HENRY LETHAM, twenty, sitt in front of the ruined car. His eyes are closed. He looks sick-- pale, skinny, disheveled-- but he has a presence, a magnetism that compels you to look at him. Finally Henry opens his eyes. After a moment he stands an walks away from the burning car, never turning around, heading for the illuminated towers of Manhattan. Somewhere nearby a BABY is HOWLING, though no one is in sight.
