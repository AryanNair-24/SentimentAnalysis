Attendants guide the journalists over to the press conference. Kurt is sitting on the podium with the director of documenta, ARTHUR KASTNER. Ellie is standing at the back of the room, a one-year-old child in her arms: a little girl. Kurt smiles over at her. She raises the baby’s arm and waves back with it. Adrian Finck is standing next to Ellie, excited but happy. Arthur Kastner taps the microphone.

With these pictures, which admittedly have genuine force in some mysterious’ way, Kurt Barnert seems on his way to becoming one of the leading artists of his generation - in painting, a supposedly long dead medium. But, like so many of his generation, he has no statement to make, no stories to tell, and nothing to say. He is rejecting artistic tradition, side- stepping the auto-biographical and is thus creating, perhaps for the first time in the history of art... a body of work in which the artist is almost irrelevant. The camera CLOSES IN on the picture of "Mother with Child" behind him until the reporter is OUT OF SHOT. JOURNALIST #3 (O.C., CONT’D) Was that good?
