3) 20) dialog: Pacific all-what?
3) 24) dialog: Is there anything I can do?
3) 28) dialog: (With a little smile) Perhaps I know what you mean, Mr.  Neff. I've just been taking a sun  bath.
3) 32) dialog: That's all right. If you can wait  till I put something on, I'll be  right down. Nettie, show Mr. Neff  into the living room.
3) 45) dialog: I hope I've got my face on straight.
3) 47) dialog: (Crossing to the mirror  over the fireplace) Won't you sit down, Mr. -- Neff is  the name, isn't it?
3) 49) dialog: What story?
3) 51) dialog: (She works with her  lipstick) About the insurance. My husband never  tells me anything.
3) 55) text: Phyllis smiles faintly and covers the anklet with her dre
3) 57) dialog: I guess he's been too busy down at  Long Beach in the oil fields.
3) 59) dialog: I suppose so. But he's never home  much before eight.
3) 61) dialog: You're not connected with the  Automobile Club, are you?
3) 63) dialog: Somebody from the Automobile Club  has been trying to get him. Do they  have a better rate?
3) 65) dialog: No, he isn't.
3) 66) text: Phyllis rises and walks up and down, paying less and less attention.

3) 71) dialog: You're a smart insurance man, aren't  you, Mr. Neff?
3) 73) dialog: Doing pretty well?
3) 75) dialog: You handle just automobile insurance,  or all kinds?
3) 78) dialog: Accident insurance?

3) 84) dialog: Phyllis.
3) 86) dialog: But you're not sure?
3) 88) dialog: (Standing up again) Mr. Neff, why don't you drop by  tomorrow evening about eight-thirty.  He'll be in then.
3) 90) dialog: My husband. You were anxious to talk  to him weren't you?
3) 92) dialog: There's a speed limit in this state,  Mr. Neff. Forty-five miles an hour.
3) 94) dialog: I'd say about ninety.
3) 96) dialog: Suppose I let you off with a warning  this time.
3) 98) dialog: Suppose I have to whack you over the  knuckles.
3) 100) dialog: Suppose you try putting it on my  husband's shoulder.
3) 104) dialog: That's what I suggested.
3) 109) dialog: I guess so. I usually am.
3) 111) dialog: (Opening the door) I wonder if I know what you mean.
6) 4) dialog: Hello, Mr. Neff.
6) 6) dialog: Aren't you coming in?
6) 9) dialog: I hope you didn't mind my changing  the appointment. Last night wasn't  so convenient.
6) 13) dialog: I was just fixing some iced tea.  Would you like a glass?
6) 15) dialog: There might be some. I never know  what's in the ice box. (Calls) Nettie!... 
6) 17) dialog: About those renewals, Mr. Neff. I  talked to my husband about it.
6) 19) dialog: Yes. He'll renew with you he told  me. In fact, I thought he'd be here  this afternoon.
6) 21) dialog: No.
6) 23) dialog: (Calls again,  impatiently) Nettie!... Nettie!... Oh, I forgot,  it's the maid's day off.
6) 25) dialog: Lemon? Sugar?
6) 31) dialog: Fresh.
6) 33) dialog: I didn't think you'd learned it from  a correspondence course.
6) 35) dialog: No. Californian. Born right here in  Los Angeles.
6) 37) dialog: I wanted to ask you something, Mr.  Neff.
6) 39) dialog: Walter.
6) 41) dialog: Tell me, Walter, on this insurance --  how much commission do you make?
6) 43) dialog: I thought maybe I could throw a little  more business your way.
6) 45) dialog: I was thinking about my husband. I  worry a lot about him, down in those  oil fields. It's very dangerous.
6) 47) dialog: He doesn't just sit behind a desk.  He's right down there with the  drilling crews. It's got me worried  sick.
6) 49) dialog: Please don't talk like that.
6) 51) dialog: The other day a casing line snapped  and caught the foreman. He's in the  hospital with a broken back.
6) 53) dialog: It's got me jittery just thinking  about it. Suppose something like  that happened to my husband?
6) 55) dialog: Don't you think he ought to have  accident insurance?
6) 57) dialog: What kind of insurance could he have?
6) 59) dialog: Capital sum? What's that?
6) 61) dialog: I suppose you have to think of  everything in your business.
6) 63) dialog: You could try. But he's pretty tough  going.
6) 65) dialog: He's got a lot on his mind. He doesn't  want to listen to anything except  maybe a baseball game on the radio.  Sometimes we sit all evening without  saying a word to each other.
6) 67) text: Phyllis shrugs.
6) 68) dialog: So I just sit and knit.
6) 70) dialog: Maybe I like the way his thumbs hold  up the wool.
6) 72) dialog: I want to ask you something, Mr.  Neff. Could I get an accident policy  for him -- without bothering him at  all?
6) 74) dialog: That would make it easier for you,  too. You wouldn't even have to talk  to him. I have a little allowance of  my own. I could pay for it and he  needn't know anything about it.
6) 76) dialog: Because I know he doesn't want  accident insurance. He's superstitious  about it.
6) 78) dialog: If there was a way to get it like  that, all the worry would be over.  You see what I mean, Walter?
6) 80) dialog: Is there anything wrong with it?
6) 82) dialog: What crown block?
6) 84) dialog: I don't know what you're talking  about.
6) 86) dialog: Are you crazy?
6) 89) dialog: What's the matter?
6) 91) dialog: Get away with what?
6) 93) dialog: That's a horrible thing to say!
6) 95) dialog: I think you're rotten.
6) 97) dialog: Get out of here.
10) 5) dialog: Hello.
10) 7) dialog: You forgot your hat this afternoon.
10) 11) dialog: Don't you want me to bring it in?
10) 15) dialog: It's in the phone book.
10) 17) dialog: It's raining.
10) 21) dialog: Long Beach. They're spudding in a  new well. He phoned he'd be late.  About nine-thirty.
10) 23) dialog: It's about time you said you're glad  to see me.
10) 25) dialog: Like what?
10) 27) dialog: I must have said something that gave  you a terribly wrong impression. You  must surely see that. You must never  think anything like that about me,  Walter.
10) 29) dialog: It's not okay. Not if you don't  believe me.
10) 31) dialog: I want you to be nice to me. Like  the first time you came to the house.
10) 33) dialog: I know it has. It's happened to us.
10) 35) text: Phyllis has moved over to the window. She stares out thro the wet window-pane.
10) 37) dialog: I feel as if he was watching me. Not  that he cares about me. Not any more.  But he keeps me on a leash. So tight  I can't breathe. I'm scared.
10) 39) dialog: I oughtn't to have come.
10) 41) dialog: You want me to go?
10) 43) dialog: Right now?
10) 47) dialog: Do what?
10) 49) dialog: Walter, for the last time --
10) 52) dialog: I'm crazy about you, Walter.
10) 54) dialog: Something French. I bought it down  at Ensenada.
10) 56) dialog: Bourbon is fine, Walter.
10) 60) dialog: Plain water, please.
10) 64) text: Phyllis has the glasses now. She hands them to him. He du some ice cubes into the glasses.
10) 65) dialog: Who didn't?
10) 69) dialog: Perhaps it was worth it to her.
10) 74) dialog: It's nice here, Walter. Who takes  care of it for you?
10) 76) dialog: You get your own breakfast?
10) 79) dialog: It sounds wonderful. Just strangers  beside you. You don't know them. You  don't hate them. You don't have to  sit across the table and smile at  him and that daughter of his every  morning of your life.
10) 81) dialog: Yes. Lola. She lives with us. He  thinks a lot more of her than he  does of me.
10) 83) dialog: He wouldn't give me a divorce.
10) 85) dialog: He hasn't got any money. Not since  he went into the oil business.
10) 87) dialog: Yes, he had. And I wanted a home.  Why not? But that wasn't the only  reason. I was his wife's nurse. She  was sick for a long time. When she  died, he was all broken up. I pitied  him so.
10) 89) dialog: Yes, Walter. He's so mean to me.  Every-time I buy a dress or a pair  of shoes he yells his head off. He  won't let me go anywhere. He keeps  me shut up. He's always been mean to  me. Even his life insurance all goes  to that daughter of his. That Lola.
10) 91) dialog: No. And nothing is just what I'm  worth to him.
10) 93) dialog: Walter, I don't want to kill him. I  never did. Not even when he gets  drunk and slaps my face.
10) 95) dialog: Perhaps I do.
10) 97) dialog: Perhaps that too.
10) 99) dialog: The other night we drove home from a  party. He was drunk again. When we  got into the garage he just sat there  with his head on the steering wheel  and the motor still running. And I  thought what it would be like if I  didn't switch it off, just closed  the garage door and left him there.
