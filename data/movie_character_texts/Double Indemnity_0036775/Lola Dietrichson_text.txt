13) 19) text: Phyllis throws a quick glance at Neff. As she looks back sees that Lola is staring down at her wrist watch.
13) 20) dialog: Phyllis, do you mind if we don't  finish this game? It bores me stiff.
13) 22) dialog: Yes, I have.
13) 24) dialog: (To Dietrichson) Father, is it all right if I run  along now?
13) 26) dialog: Just Anne. We're going roller skating.
13) 28) dialog: Anne Matthews.
13) 31) dialog: It's Anne Matthews, I told you. I  also told you we're going roller  skating. I'm meeting her at the corner  of Vermont and Franklin -- the north- west corner, in case you're  interested. And I'm late already. I  hope that is all clear. Good night,  Father. Good night, Phyllis.
13) 34) dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. Good night, Mr. --

14) 9) dialog: Down the hill. Down Vermont.
15) 2) dialog: I can take it or leave it.
15) 3) text: Neff looks at her curiously. Lola meets his glance.
15) 5) text: This is an embarrassing moment for Lola.
15) 6) dialog: Yes, I am. You see, Mr. Neff, I'm  having a very tough time at home. My  father doesn't understand me and  Phyllis hates me.
15) 8) dialog: That's why I have to lie sometimes.
15) 10) dialog: It's Vermont and Franklin all right.  Only it's not Anne Matthews. It's  Nino Zachetti. You won't tell on me,  will you?
15) 12) dialog: Nino's not what my father says at  all. He just had bad luck. He was  doing pre-med at U.S.C. and working  nights as an usher in a theater  downtown. He got behind in his credits  and flunked out. Then he lost his  job for talking back. He's so hot- headed.
15) 14) dialog: I guess my father thinks nobody's  good enough for his daughter except  maybe the guy that owns Standard  Oil. Would you like a stick of gum?
15) 16) text: Lola puts a stick of gum in her mouth.
15) 17) dialog: I can't give Nino up. I wish father  could see it my way.
15) 19) dialog: I suppose it will sometime. (Looking out) This is the corner right here, Mr.  Neff.
15) 21) dialog: There he is. By the bus stop.
16) 1) dialog: He needs a hair-cut, doesn't he.  Look at him. No job, no car, no money,  no prospects, no nothing. (Pause) I love him.
16) 3) dialog: (Calling) Nino!
16) 8) dialog: This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
16) 11) dialog: Nino. Please. Mr. Neff gave me a  ride from the house. I told him all  about us.
16) 13) dialog: We don't have to worry about Mr.  Neff, Nino.
16) 15) dialog: What's the matter with you, Nino?  He's a friend.
16) 19) dialog: Of course I'm coming. Don't mind  him, Mr. Neff.
16) 20) text: Lola steps out of the car.
16) 21) dialog: Thanks a lot. You've been very sweet.

40) 6) dialog: Mr. Neff, I can't help it, but I  have such a strange feeling that  there is something queer about my  father's death.
40) 8) dialog: I don't know why I should be bothering  you with my troubles, except that  you knew my father and knew about  the insurance he took out. And you  were so nice to me that evening in  your car.
40) 11) dialog: Look at me, Mr. Neff. I'm not crazy.  I'm not hysterical. I'm not even  crying. But I have the awful feeling  that something is wrong, and I had  the same feeling once before -- when  my mother died.
40) 13) dialog: We were up at Lake Arrowhead. That  was six years ago. We had a cabin  there. It was winter and very cold  and my mother was very sick with  pneumonia. She had a nurse with her.  There were just the three of us in  the cabin. One night I got up and  went into my mother's room. She was  delirious with fever. All the bed  covers were on the floor and the  windows were wide open. The nurse  wasn't in the room. I ran and covered  my mother up as quickly as I could.  Just then I heard a door open behind  me. The nurse stood there. She didn't  say a word, but there was a look in  her eyes I'll never forget. Two days  later my mother was dead. (Pause) Do you know who that nurse was?
40) 16) dialog: Phyllis. I tried to tell my father,  but I was just a kid then and he  wouldn't listen to me. Six months  later she married him and I kind of  talked myself out of the idea that  she could have done anything like  that. But now it's all back again,  now that something has happened to  my father, too.
40) 18) dialog: Yes, and two days before he fell off  that train what was Phyllis doing?  She was in her room in front of a  mirror, with a black hat on, and she  was pinning a black veil to it, as  if she couldn't wait to see how she  would look in mourning.
40) 20) dialog: I caught her eyes in the mirror, and  they had that look in them they had  before my mother died. That same  look.
40) 22) dialog: I loathe her. Because she did it.  She did it for the money. Only you're  not going to pay her, are you, Mr.  Neff? She's not going to get away  with it this time. I'm going to speak  up. I'm going to tell everything I  know.
40) 24) dialog: I'm not afraid. You'll see.
40) 26) dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to act like  this.
40) 28) dialog: No one.
40) 30) dialog: Of course not. I'm not living in the  house any more. I moved out.
40) 32) dialog: I'm not seeing him any more. We had  a fight.
40) 34) dialog: I got myself a little apartment in  Hollywood.
40) 37) dialog: (Through her tears) Yes, Mr. Neff.
41) 0) text: Neff and Lola driving along the beach near Santa Monica.  Neff is wearing a light summer suit, very much in contras to Lola's mourning.

His mi is full of other thoughts.
44) 5) text: Lola doesn't answer.
44) 7) dialog: (In a choked voice) Of course I will, Walter. I wouldn't  tell anybody else but you. It's about  Nino.
44) 9) dialog: They killed my father together. He  and Phyllis. He helped her do it. I  know he did.
44) 11) dialog: I've been following him. He's at her  house, night after night. It was  Phyllis and him all the time. Maybe  he was going with me just for a blind.  And the night of the murder --
44) 13) dialog: -- he was supposed to pick me up  after a lecture at U.C.L.A. -- but  he never showed up. He said he was  sick. Sick! He couldn't show up,  because the train was leaving with  my father on it.
44) 15) dialog: Maybe I'm just crazy. Maybe it's all  just in my mind.
44) 17) dialog: I only wish it was, Walter, because  I still love him.
