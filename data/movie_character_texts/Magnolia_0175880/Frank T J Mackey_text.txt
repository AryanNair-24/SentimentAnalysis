You will not take my soul and you will not win this game." 'cause it is a game, guys, you wanna  think it's not -- go back to the schoolyard and have a crush on Mary Jane -- respect  the cock -- you are embedding this thought: I'm in charge.  I'm the one who says yes,  no, now or here.  Shit, man.  Sad but true. Sad But True.  And you wanna know what? It must be the way.  The thing about chicks and the thing about this course that we're going  through today is how universal the whole  thing is.  I mean: I wish I could sit here  and say that it's not -- because the reality? If each chick had something new, something really new that I'd never seen before?  Fuckin' hell: I'd be in the money!  Because  I'd have to create a hundred new cassettes, a hundred new books, a hundred new seminars  and hundred new videos just to deal with each and every situation a chick could create -  but that is just not the case.  They are universal. They are sheep. They are to be studied and  watched -- they have patterns that must be stopped, interupted and resisted. I'd be makin' a fuckin' butt load if they were actually as much of  a challenge as they want you to think they are! Reality: They Are All The Same.  Each and every one of them.  And once you learn  these methods: You're Set.  You Don't Have To Come Back. That's it. In solid. Boom.  Done.  Over.  Why? Because all women are the same.  Period.  End of discussion.  Sorry.  It's true.  Sad But True. And anyone who wants to say that these methods we work by are "unfair?"  Yes, they are. Guilty as charged.  And so's the world.  It's a harsh, hard unfair place, but it's not  gonna stop me from getting my fair shair of hair pie --  Period.  Sorry.  End of discussion.

Buy a calendar. Next move?  Mark the calendar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What did I pay my eight  hundred dollars for?  To hear Frank tell me to buy a calendar and mark it?

"On the fourth of June, Denise, you're gonna be lickin' my spoon." "And Come August, You Suck My Big Fat Sausage."  I've SET GOALS FOR MYSELF. And what?  I've said "enough is enough." Because why?  She's not gonna be your pal. She's not gonna be your friend.  You think she's gonna be there for you the second you need something?  Think again - this fuckin' bitch Denise! (audience cheers)  But: Listen up:  That is not to say that we don't all need women as friends, 'cause we're gonna  learn later on in Chapter 23 that having a couple of chick-friends laying around can come in real handy in setting Jealousy Traps.  But we'll get to that.  Number One (this is page 18 in your booklets, blue cover - go to it and follow along with me.)

And if they think that way -- then they are asking for you to hurt them and  That Is What You Must Do.  That is what you must do which is punish them many, many times over.

129) 14) dialog: no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear? 
129) 16) dialog: I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up  there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are:  Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit.  So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's  what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not  even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and  saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen  to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.

148) 2) dialog: -- that's right, that's right, and what I'M  saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm  talking about eliminating insight and understanding as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take  any subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the  great shit that you've had happen to you in  your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle  and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient" (in other words: The Chick) settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE.  A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put  it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the  seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party  'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
