4) 0) text: Elizabeth walks down the hall holding her box. SIXTH, SEVENTH and EIGHTH graders all race past her, running toward their summer vacation.
5) 2) dialog: Hand it over. The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze. One of the burnouts hands her the joint.
5) 7) dialog: Everything. The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with a couple of joints. They hand it over to Elizabeth.
5) 8) dialog: This was a warning. Next time, I don't call the principal. I call the cops.
6) 0) text: Elizabeth walks to her brand new MERCEDES. She gets in, pulls out a joint and lights it. She takes a huge TOKE, and then PEELS out of the lot. She tosses her banker's box out the window and extends her hand, giving the school THE FINGER.

7) 1) dialog: 
7) 6) dialog: Yeah. You should have seen it. What a joke. She raises her glass for a toast. He raises his.
7) 7) dialog: Here's to me never having to work again. And I owe it all to you, Lover. Elizabeth takes a big sip.

8) 14) dialog: You love her? She's a hooker.
8) 20) dialog: 
8) 22) dialog: Shut the fuck up. (then, to Mark, sweet) And. maybe I'm talking crazy, but I don't want to throw away our life together over something like this. We're getting married! I'm willing to fight for us.
8) 24) dialog: I'm sorry if I care that my future husband can support me. We didn't all grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths. You can't even imagine what it's like going to bed hungry, night after night.
8) 26) dialog: My parents worked their asses off to send me to private school. Do you know what it's like driving a Pontiac when everyone else gets a Beemer the second they menstruate? That shit stays with you.
8) 32) dialog: For the record, there's a shitload of things that I hate about you, but I still, would've gotten married. (beat, sweet) Because I love you.
8) 34) dialog: You sad little troll! I hope you and your hooker enjoy chlamydia together!

8) 37) dialog: Like I even want your gay-ass ring. She tries pulling it off.
8) 38) dialog: It's not coming off. I'll go to the jeweler's tomorrow. Mark takes her hand and removes the ring with ease. Elizabeth steps out into the night. The door SLAMS behind her.

12) 12) dialog: (under her breath) Fuck my ass.
12) 14) dialog: And do what? Sell perfume at the mall? Work at a day care center? (slurps her big gulp) You know, when I first got into teaching, I thought I was doing it for all the right reasons: short hours, summers off, no accountability.
12) 16) dialog: From now on, my full-time job will be finding a guy who will take care of me --
12) 18) dialog: And that makes a shit ton of money and doesn't ask too many questions. (licking her fingers) I spent most of my summer hanging out at the bars near where the Bulls practice. Had some fun, got some cool souvenirs that I Ebayed, but those guys aren't looking to settle down. And they all wear condoms. And then they take the condoms with them. That's how paranoid they are that a girl will try and get pregnant. Like it's so easy to get pregnant from a guy nutting into a condom.
12) 20) dialog: I've been thinking about it a lot. I mean, I figure I'm like an 8, 8.5. But once I get my new tits, I'll probably be a --
12) 27) dialog: I know I'm hot, Lynn, but I don't stand a chance against all those Barbies dolls out there. Anna Nicole had it right, may she rest in peace. Lynn checks her watch.
12) 29) dialog: Yeah, I'm not going to that.
12) 31) dialog: ("I'm so scared") Ooohhh...
12) 34) dialog: Yeah, it was alright. When you said you were taking me to lunch, I kinda thought it was going to be nicer, but this was okay.
12) 36) dialog: It's okay. You can get me next time.

19) 16) dialog: Thanks. I love men's watches. It's kind of a hobby.
19) 18) dialog: Oh? Your grandfather designs watches?
19) 20) dialog: Shut up!
19) 23) dialog: 
19) 25) dialog: That's why I got it. They turn a corner. Garrett wheels his backpack past them
19) 27) dialog: Hey... dude... She slaps him five. Scott notices, smiles.
19) 34) dialog: Yeah... So did you and your wife just move to town?
19) 36) dialog: Me neither. I was engaged until I walked in on my fiance cheating on me. With his brother.

20) 14) dialog: My credit situation is complicated.

24) 4) dialog: That turquoise crap? Blech. No one's buying that. (then, catching herself) But it looks great on you.
24) 6) dialog: What type of person do you think I am?! That assbag cheated on me. Did I ever tell you that he has a mole on the tip of his dick?
24) 7) dialog: I'm just trying to better myself. I don't think that's asking for so much. Amy walks over.
24) 14) dialog: Huh. Well, do you think mental retards should be happy with the way they are? Amy stammers.
24) 15) dialog: Lynn, you teach them. What do you think?
24) 19) dialog: We don't all have your tits, Squirrel. So maybe you should think before you interrupt a private conversation.
24) 21) dialog: That's right. Walk away. (then, noticing)- There he is! Scott enters. All of the female teachers light up. There he is!

28) 15) dialog: Is this new? I love it! I think dolphins are smarter than humans.
28) 23) dialog: What a great story. Principal Snur visibly relaxes. He's sitting across from a kindred spirit.
28) 25) dialog: Actually, I was thinking that I want to get more involved.
28) 27) dialog: Specifically, I thought I could supervise the car wash.

37) 9) dialog: Here what is?
37) 11) dialog: Oh, yes. In the memo. The Secretary leaves. Elizabeth stares at the box. Tristan and.a couple kids start making farting noises with their hands.
37) 12) dialog: Hey. Zip it. Zip your shit.
37) 14) dialog: Hey. Elizabeth passes the box to the front of the class, where the kids dutifully take Scan-trons and test booklets.

38) 27) dialog: So, Scott, I was thinking, I would love to hear about your experiences in the Peace Corps. I love Haiti. Maybe we could go grab a drink some night. Maybe tonight.
38) 34) dialog: (news to her) Yeah, Silly, I meant after.

40) 1) dialog: Hi, my name's Elizabeth Halsey. Soooooo... Any questions? Sasha's Mother eagerly raises her hand. Elizabeth points to her.
40) 3) dialog: That's exactly what I say to my students. Listen, I'm a good teacher. And the school hired me because I'm good at what I do. (as the parents take this in) And the reason your son loves my class is because I inspire him. Movies are one tool that I use. I also use other multimedia techniques, which I'm not going to get into right now. Look, I could take you day by day through my entire syllabus, but that's not how I do things. I'm not one of these stuffy teachers who's totally by the book. I talk to the kids like they're little adults. It's about mutual respect. So that's my spiel, as the Jews say.
40) 11) dialog: Chris... Great kid -- and precocious. You must be so proud.
40) 13) dialog: If I know Chris, he'll get there.

41) 8) dialog: 
41) 11) dialog: It's just so hard, on my salary, having to pay for my supplies, my fiance cheated on me with his twin sister... and, unlike a lot of these other teachers, all I truly care about is helping your child learn. And as their personal tutor, I guarantee a full grade higher -- or your money back. Chase's mom takes out her check book.
41) 12) dialog: Make it out to "cash."
42) 0) text: Parents are leaving the class, ad-libbing "thank.you's." Another SET OF PARENTS surreptitiously hand Elizabeth some cash. A Bohemian mother, MELODY, wearing a beret, lingers behin
42) 2) dialog: 
42) 10) dialog: You must be so proud.
42) 12) dialog: A kid like that, if I could just give some more one on one time, he would just blossom.
42) 14) dialog: Unfortunately, in a class of twenty- five...
42) 16) dialog: And with the amount they pay teachers...
42) 18) dialog: I guess what I'm getting at is, maybe you could help out by giving me a little -- you know -- somethin somethin. Elizabeth offers her hand, palm up. Melody stares back at her blankly.
42) 19) dialog: It's just, it's really tough to teach the way that I want to teach when there's so little money. I mean, look at this place.

49) 0) text: The SONG continues as the hallway fills with excited kids, who race down the hall and talk animatedly with friends. Elizabeth pushes through the center.
50) 0) text: The SONG continues. Elizabeth sits in her car. She lights a joint with the cigarette lighter and deeply inhales. KNOCK KNOCK! The SONG abruptly ENDS. Elizabeth jumps. She turns to her window, sees Sasha, bundled in her winter coat, waving.
50) 1) dialog: (through the window) What do you want? Sasha motions for her to roll down the window. Elizabeth doesn't.
50) 3) dialog: It is. But it's medicinal. Doctor gave it to me. Not that it's any of your business.
50) 11) dialog: (peering through window) Are those oatmeal raisin?
50) 13) dialog: You have anything to drink? Sasha shakes her head.
50) 14) dialog: Word to the wise: stop dressing like you're running for congress.
50) 16) dialog: See? That's what I'm talking about. Keep saying stuff like that, you're gonna get punched. You really want to be President or is that what your parents tell to be? Sasha shrugs.
50) 17) dialog: You don't have to decide right now. Who knows? Maybe you wake up one day and decide that you love giving massages and you want to be a masseuse. Salary plus tips. Think about it.
50) 19) dialog: (shakes her head) Hopeless. Watch your feet.
51) 0) text: Elizabeth rolls over. It's 3:40 PM. She yawns and gets out of bed.

52) 1) dialog: Seriously?
53) 0) text: Elizabeth walks up to the door. It's locked. She shakes the door.
53) 1) dialog: Seriously? She sees a HOMELESS GUY leaning against the storefront.
53) 2) dialog: Why's the store closed? The Homeless Guy looks at her strangely.
53) 4) dialog: Seriously? Elizabeth looks around. The streets are empty. Not a person in sight.

55) 14) dialog: Can I give you some advice?
55) 16) dialog: Number one, stop writing poetry. Two: stop reading it. And three: don't set your sights so high. I mean, she's really hot. If I were you, I'd try for that chubby girl that sits up front -- the one with the teeth? Elizabeth puts her hands to show teeth going off in different directions.
55) 18) dialog: Not gonna happen. Look, I was that hot girl. Hotter, even. And I never would have gone out with a kid like you. And I'm not saying that to be mean. I'm saying it to be helpful.
55) 20) dialog: I'll tell you what I know: a kid who wears the same "Gymnastics" sweatshirt three days a week isn't getting laid until he's 26. That's what I know.
55) 28) dialog: Well, there's a reason he didn't pack it.
55) 30) dialog: Good luck being a loser. Thank your mom for dinner. Elizabeth heads for the door.

60) 0) text: Amy listens to NPR as she pulls into the empty parking lot. Suddenly, she SLAMS on her brakes. ELIZABETH'S CAR is already there. Amy puts her car in park and gets out. She walks over to Elizabeth's car and feels the hood.
61) 0) text: The clicking of Amy's shoes ECHO through the empty hallwa She stops, takes off her shoes. She pitter-patters down the hall to Elizabeth's classroom and PEERS in.
62) 0) text: Elizabeth is at the chalkboard, intently writing questions. She senses something in her periphery and looks over at her window. Nothing. Elizabeth goes back to work.
63) 0) text: Elizabeth waits in the doorway impatiently as the kids filter in. Garrett brings up the rear, rolling his backpack into class.
63) 1) dialog: 
63) 5) dialog: 
63) 8) dialog: Come on, come on. We have a lot to cover so sit down. The class, still confused, quickly take their seats.
63) 9) dialog: Alright then. Now. Open your To'Kill A Mockingbird to page one. The kids slowly take out their books. We HEAR the distinct sound of twenty-five book spines cracking as they're opened for the first time.
63) 14) dialog: (checking her notes) Good. Now, who can tell me why Jem cries when the hole in the tree is filled with cement? Anyone?
63) 16) dialog: 
63) 18) dialog: We're here to learn. Anyone else have a problem with that? Good. So who has the answer to my question? Everyone looks down.
63) 19) dialog: Nobody's read this book? It's on the syllabus.
63) 21) dialog: Well, now I am. And we're having a quiz tomorrow. Panic.
63) 22) dialog: On the first hundred pages. PANDEMONIUM.
63) 29) dialog: Hey! Zip your shit! We've fallen behind, and honestly, your practice tests scores sucked balls -- which was embarrassing to me both on a personal level and as an educator.
64) 0) text: Elizabeth reads To Kill a mockingbird and highlights like crazy. She stops, takes a hit from her bong, and continues. Her roommate, Kirk, enters through the front door, sipping from a Big Gulp.
64) 1) dialog: Did you get my Cool Ranch? He tosses her a bag of chips.
65) 0) text: Elizabeth paces. She has a book of stickers in her hand.
65) 1) dialog: Okay, now, what is the significance of the Mockingbird in the novel? What was Harper Lee trying to tell us? No one raises their hand.
65) 2) dialog: 
65) 4) dialog: (rolls her eyes) Anyone else?
65) 9) dialog: 
65) 11) dialog: Okay, good. Can anyone add to what that girl said?

70) 0) text: The class is split up into mini-sections of four desks each. The students are quietly and dutifully working. As Elizabeth reads papers and grades them, we HEAR the various student's voices.
70) 8) dialog: Sit down. Elizabeth races to the window.
70) 10) dialog: (under her breath) Balls. She races back to her desk.
70) 16) dialog: Keep reading. Elizabeth takes her seat and leans under her desk, obscuring her from her class. She opens her pocketbook and pulls out a CIGARETTE CASE. She pops it open and we SEE three neatly rolled JOINTS. Without hesitation, Elizabeth POPS the first one into her mouth and starts chewing vigorously. As she. makes her way through the second and then the third, the chewing becomes slower and the BARKING becomes louder and louder. Elizabeth starts CHOKING as the door opens and the Police Officer and the German Shepherd enter, followed by Principal Snur and Amy.
70) 18) dialog: Sorry. I had something caught in my throat. The German Shepherd continues barking.
70) 28) dialog: (pointedly to Amy) Thank you, Principal Snur. Now if you'll excuse me, my class has a state test to prepare for. Principal Snur, Amy and the Police Officer exit. Elizabeth slumps down into her chair, and all at once, the combination of WEED and COUGH SYRUP HITS HER.
70) 29) dialog: Whoa.
70) 31) dialog: Class dismissed.
70) 33) dialog: Get out of my face. (then, to Garrett) And leave the corn chips. The class uncertainly gathers their things and heads out. From outside Elizabeth's window, we SEE the SCHOOL BUSSES idling curbside. Elizabeth stares at the papers she still needs to grade. The papers stare back at her.
70) 34) dialog: (to no one) But first, a nap.
71) 0) text: Elizabeth is asleep at her desk. She wakes with a jolt. A paper is stuck to her face. She looks again at the stack of work, then at the pile of things she's already corrected. There's FOUR.
71) 1) dialog: Balls! She knocks the stack of ungraded papers to the ground. After a beat, she collects herself, goes to pick the, papers off the floor. As she starts tossing them into the trash, something catches her eye: a PRACTICE TEST MANUAL. And in the corner, an address:
71) 3) dialog: Huh. Elizabeth tears off the corner and pockets it.
73) 0) text: Elizabeth knocks on the door. A buff, shirtless guy in a backwards hat opens it. He likes what he sees.
73) 2) dialog: Is Tucker here?
74) 0) text: Tucker sits on his bed. Elizabeth leans against a desk, unwilling to sit down on anything in his disgusting room. BOB MARLEY plays softly.
74) 2) dialog: No. He dumped me, remember?
74) 5) dialog: Like I told "Frat Guy #1," I'm not interested.
74) 11) dialog: I need some date rape drugs.

76) 6) dialog: Great drive. I love downstate Illinois.
76) 13) dialog: Hmm mmm.

76) 19) dialog: Listen, I'd love to sit here and chat with you all night.
76) 21) dialog: But I'm sure you're a very busy man, so I'll get right down to it.
76) 24) dialog: No problem.
76) 31) dialog: Oh, right. Elizabeth takes out a notebook and pen and starts jotting down notes.
76) 33) dialog: You don't need to convince me. But you know what would help, Carl? For me to see one of this year's tests.
76) 36) dialog: I'd really love to see it sooner. I'm on a bit of a deadline.
76) 38) dialog: Ooh, you look like you're CIA. Listen, I totally get it. Enough business for one night.
76) 41) dialog: Fantastic. (then, to Bartender) One white wine, one tequila sunrise, and two shots of tequila.
77) 0) text: Carl is a little tipsy and slurring his words. Elizabeth seems to be fine.
77) 2) dialog: Well, that makes two of us. Elizabeth gives Carl "fuck me" eyes. He nervously sips his drink.
77) 3) dialog: What turns you on, Carl?
77) 5) dialog: You know what turns me on, Carl? He giggles nervously.
77) 6) dialog: 
77) 10) dialog: Even better.
78) 2) dialog: Do you have anything to drink? Carl goes to a mini-fridge and pulls out an already opened bottle of white wine.
78) 8) dialog: White wine in the office. You're a bad boy. Carl pours a glass. Elizabeth swigs from the bottle.
78) 9) dialog: Do you have any music?
78) 11) dialog: A toast. To new friends.
78) 15) dialog: Whatever, man. I'm gonna hit the lady's room.
79) 0) text: Elizabeth waits in the bathroom. Yawns. Checks her watch.
80) 0) text: She walks back in. Carl looks woozy. The only thing keeping him from passing out is the prospect of seeing Elizabeth naked.
80) 8) dialog: Easy, Cowboy. Carl stumbles towards her. Elizabeth deftly moves around the desk and exits into the bullpen.
80) 10) dialog: (as to a child) Carl, I'm gonna need you to pass the fuck out. Carl smiles as he feebly chases after her. He. stops at the photocopier, steadies himself momentarily and then passes out, STILL STANDING. Elizabeth grabs the lanyard from Carl's neck and heads ba into his office. She goes over to the filing cabinets, unlocks it with one of the keys, and starts rifling. She pulls out a folder.
80) 12) dialog: And bingo was his name-o. She walks over to the photocopier and pushes Carl over. H collapses on the ground -- out cold. She copies the test puts it back and grabs a stack of scantrons from a shelf. She takes a post-it, scribbles something and sticks it to his forehead. As Elizabeth exits, the camera PUSHES IN: "You were AMAZING. Love, Marjorie."
81) 0) text: Elizabeth stares at the clock. 8:59... 8:59.
81) 1) dialog: Okay, go. The students open their test books and start. Twenty- five pencils hit paper in unison.
82) 0) text: Elizabeth stares at the clock. 10:59... 10:59.
82) 5) dialog: Okay, pencils down. A couple of groans. A couple of frantic moves to fill in more scantron bubbles.
82) 6) dialog: Come on, come on. It doesn't even matter. Bring your tests up. The students dutifully place their tests into a neat stack on the corner of Elizabeth's desk and exit. Elizabeth waits for all the kids to leave and then slides all of the exams into the trash. She pulls out a match and lights the exams on fire. She then reaches into her bag and pulls out a new stack of completed exams. She places the new exams into an official-looking folder and exits.
82) 21) dialog: This is unexpected. All of the color drains from Amy's face as Elizabeth stands and waves at the crowd.
83) 0) text: Teachers are exiting the auditorium. Scott catches up to Elizabeth, who's marvelling at the bonus check.
83) 2) dialog: 
83) 11) dialog: Something big. Maybe two big things. Amy walks up and gives Elizabeth a big, fake hug.
83) 15) dialog: I've got my eye on someone, but he's dating a major cunt. (then, to Scott) Pardon my French.

83) 24) dialog: 
84) 0) text: Danni, the receptionist, uncrumples a BALL OF CRUMPLED CA and counts it. Elizabeth taps her fingers impatiently.
84) 2) dialog: And this is endorsed. And the rest you can put on these. Elizabeth slides four credit cards across the desk. The MIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR from earlier walks by.
84) 5) dialog: 
84) 9) dialog: Today. Tomorrow. As soon as possible. Danni checks her calendar.
84) 11) dialog: Book it. Danni slides Elizabeth a packet of literature.

89) 14) dialog: (to Garrett, supersweet) Oh, honey, I bet everyone would just love to walk around and look at all the poetry on the walls, but unfortunately, the itinerary's really tight.
89) 16) dialog: Just go sit down, sweetie. Garrett gives her an annoyed look and then heads back to his seat. Scott smiles at Elizabeth.
89) 18) dialog: When you love what you do, it comes easy.

103) 16) dialog: It's because of my tits, isn't it? Well, I'm getting new ones in, like, two days. Don't make a decision until you see them.

111) 16) dialog: Just go out and sleep with as many girls, as you possibly can. Get her out of your head.
111) 18) dialog: Yeah, probably. But life's about how you deal with rejection. You can either hide in a corner and cry or you can get stronger every time. And I figure a kid like you with not much going for him -- if he were to choose the latter -- might end up becoming a pretty strong man.
111) 21) dialog: Now come on, let's get out of here. I'm freezing and Mr. Delacourte's probably shitting a brick.
