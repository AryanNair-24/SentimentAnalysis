64) 0) text: TIGHT ON BARRY MORRIS, mid-40's, attorney.
64) 1) dialog: I don't see how this could have been  kept from you. The facts are quite  simple; last month Adam and Lois  changed their will. They requested  that you two, as a married couple,  be the Custodians of Record for their  estate including all properties,  cash holdings, security holdings  and... children. You are legal  custodians of the Brenn Trust.
64) 4) dialog: There's more.
64) 6) dialog: Adam and Lois were not terribly  prudent in terms of providing for  the possibility of the unforeseen.
64) 8) dialog: I'm talking about Life insurance.  I'm talking about money.
64) 10) dialog: Yes money. Adam had a five hundred  thousand dollar Term Life Insurance  Policy.
64) 16) dialog: Actually, no. Adam was switching to  a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled  his medical exam... and failed to  make his last payment... so his Term  Life lapsed. So it's value is null  and void. (off Liz's horror) Now he did have a pension account,  worth another 150 thousand.
64) 18) dialog: And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
64) 21) dialog: (beat) No. Not even close. With property  values down, the house is worth  100,000 less than 450 he paid for  it. With three credit cards, the  minivan payments, and other  outstanding debts... Plus the Income  and Estate Taxes assessed on his  IRA... (punches his calculator) You'll get, oh... in the neighborhood  of, ah... 14,223 dollars.
64) 28) dialog: (breaking the tension) So. When is the wedding.
