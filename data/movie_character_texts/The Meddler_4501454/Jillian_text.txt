20) 1) dialog: I swear, I’m like the only one of my friends without full-time help. And in this town, it literally cost more than my salary to hire a decent nanny. So I quit. And now I’m home all day. All day, every day. Isn’t that right, Tehya? Tehya screams.
20) 3) dialog: Oh my god. That’s like the funniest thing ever said, ever. (MORE )
20) 5) dialog: No wonder Lori’s so funny. Well, not anymore, but.... Marnie reaches out to Tehya, but she runs off to the othe side of the room to eat her bagel.
20) 6) dialog: It’s just nobody ever tells you how lonely it is. Like some days, I don’t think I talk to another grown person the entire day. Like by the time Dani gets home, I can’t even turn off the baby talk.
20) 8) dialog: Really?
20) 10) dialog: Yeah. You're right. I don’t know why I worry so much like I’m not doing it right. Like at any moment I’m gonna do the thing that gives her a body complex or a foot fetish.... I don’t know. I lost my mom when I was young so... I’m kinda flying blind. Jillian lets out a laugh. Marnie stops.

20) 20) dialog: What? Marnie turns back to her.
20) 22) dialog: Marnie, that’s crazy.
20) 24) dialog: You should save it. Spend it on yourself. I mean, wouldn’t Lori be upset?
20) 26) dialog: I just... I mean, why would you want to do that?
20) 28) dialog: Oh my God, this is so totally amazing. Of course you’re gonna be in on all the planning.
20) 30) dialog: Oh I don’t know, nothing extravagant.... Dani was in the Navy, so... maybe it could be a nautical theme?

34) 15) dialog: Well, don’t fall in love with it, because I’m not gonna get this exact dress. I’m gonna copy it and buy cheaper fabric and have it made for half the cost. A STORE EMPLOYEE (20s) hears this and rolls her eyes.
34) 19) dialog: Well, of course, but.... RIP. Marnie rips the price-tag off of the dress. The wome all gasp. Then Jillian jumps up and down. A flurry of gir screaming, then the women all envelop Marnie in a huge hu

64) 6) dialog: (starting to cry) There are no words to describe my gratitude. I have never met anyone More generous and truly selfless. When my mother died, I never imagined that I could feel loved so... unconditionally... by someone who wasn’t in my family.
