Or at least maybe figure out what to do with his ashes....
13) 9) dialog: Well, I leave tomorrow.
13) 11) dialog: I know. But if you want to come over after dinner and help me pack and maybe even crash so you could take me to the airport in the morning, that’d be fun....

13) 25) dialog: Yeah. They stand there awkwardly for a second.
13) 27) dialog: Oh no it’s fine. We’re just doing a drive-by before I head out later. I just didn’t want her to have to spend Valentine’s Day alone.

13) 45) dialog: Don’t you understand that eighty percent of the time my phone rings, it’s you? The phone rings, and I think it could be a guy or a friend or a job and it’s my mother. Almost every single time. Do you understand how terrible that makes me feel? Marnie blinks, stung.
