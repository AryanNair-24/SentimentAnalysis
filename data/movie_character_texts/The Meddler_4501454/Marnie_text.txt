I mean, Joey left me set for life, so really I can do anything. Like when I go to an action movie, I always buy three tickets. One for me, one for Joe and one for my mother, and I don’t have to worry about it. I mean, I spend a lot of time by myself and sometimes I don’t really know what to do with the hours in the day so I call Lori, but it’s not like she really wants my advice or like I have anything important to say...
