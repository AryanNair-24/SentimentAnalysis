40) 17) dialog: Marnie?
40) 19) dialog: Do you want to join us?
40) 27) dialog: No... Everyone dies of laughter. Marnie tries to join them, laughing too hard.
40) 30) dialog: Sorry about them. They’re good guys. They just like hearing themselves talk.
40) 33) dialog: Okay.
40) 35) dialog: Do you need a ride or...? He gestures. Marnie looks at Zipper’s motorcycle. 56.
40) 37) dialog: (slight laugh) Okay, well, how bout just this once I drive it and you can sit on back. He climbs on.
40) 39) dialog: Oh, no, this isn’t a motorcycle. This is a Harley Davidson. There's a world of difference. It’s important that you understand that. A few other cops start out of Dupar’s toward their COP CA

42) 1) dialog: After I retired, I used to drive around listening to the CB just to see where the action was. And then I started following them around, so the guys said I should just come along. Sort of like unofficial back-up. In case anything goes wrong.
42) 4) dialog: No. No, but I knew of the guy following him. Hadn’t seen his family in eight years. That’s what chasing a rabbit will do to you. This hits her. She nods, letting go of irrational fears.
42) 5) dialog: Took thirty years on the force to realize you can’t save everybody. He looks through the binoculars.
42) 6) dialog: But you try. 74 58. Marnie smiles at him.

43) 17) dialog: You know what they say about counting chickens. She laughs.
43) 18) dialog: We have a very symbiotic relationship. I give them a coop and some grass and sometimes a little Parmesan cheese and they keep me in eggs. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a blue egg.
43) 19) dialog: This is from the Ameraucana. I only have one Easter Egger. He hands her the blue egg. She looks at it up close.

ZIPPER’S TOPANGA HOME -- EARLY DAWN 75 Marnie and Zipper walk up to the coop. He holds open a chicken-wire gate and she nervously walks through it. She stands there as Zipper calls to the chickens and spreads some feed.
43) 24) dialog: Okay, that’s Joan, that’s Gertude, that’s Henrietta... Don’t let her sass you. She’s got an attitude on account of being so damn beautiful. Ladies, this is Marnie. Marnie shyly waves at them. Zipper walks to the other sid of the coop and messes with a boom box, an extension cord extends into the house.
43) 25) dialog: Couple a months back, I was cleaning the coop and playing my boom box and I looked at their faces and I swear, the chickens just looked happy. So I dida little experiment to see what kind of music they dig the most. Rock ‘n’ roll makes them lay eggs like crazy, but seems to stress them out. Classical works. Reggae does not. But I find for the perfect balance of productivity and happiness, all roads lead to Dolly. He pushes PLAY on the boom box and a Dolly Parton song pl Zipper and Marnie stand in the coop.
43) 27) dialog: Don’t they look like they’re smiling? She looks at the chickens. They all have different chicke faces. She can’t tell if they’re smiling, but she sure is It gets wider and wider, as she moves around the coop, tw stepping out of the chickens’ way. It’s almost dancing. 61. 76 INT.

43) 35) dialog: Lizzy was still in high school when her mom and I fell apart, which was mostly my fault. 70/30. 60/40, maybe. I was working all the time. I brought it home with me. And as soon as she started to slip away, I started gripping and I guess I held on too tightly. And I lost her. Lizzy, I mean. The younger one. (then) She’s in a rehab-- (correcting himself) Program. She’s in a program. I was hoping one of those steps would lead her back here, but.... (then) I don’t know. I was a hot head then. I let my temper get the best of me. I was too strict. Had too many rules. Curfews. Made them scared to tell me things.
43) 37) dialog: (slight scoff) Well, not anymore.
43) 40) dialog: Yeah, it has its moments. I’ve learned to calm down. I meditate, if you can believe that. The chickens keep me in line. Sometimes I hit the bag in the garage. Mostly I just exercise patience. With everything. My ex. My girls. If Lizzy doesn’t want me to call her anymore, I have to respect that.
43) 42) dialog: I left her messages until it was full.
43) 44) dialog: I really wouldn’t know what to say.

She slides the spatula underneath it and flips it at exactly the right time. -- Marnie sits at the table and cuts into the egg-fried bread. She salts the single bite and puts it in her mouth It’s so good, her eyes roll back. -- Bite after bite, it seems to only get better. She hasn tasted an egg like this in so long. Maybe ever. -- Marnie finishes the last bite, wipes her mouth and pou a fist on the table, as she swallows. And exhales. Slowly her expression changes from ecstasy to something like gui -- At the sink, she scrubs the plate clean, shaking her h 80 81 82 83 84 65.
