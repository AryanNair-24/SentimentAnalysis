The pimp rifles his pockets, then pulls a knife, about to slice his throat, when a shadow falls over him. He turns, and we see the face of Lestat, who lifts him into the air by his throat, breaking his neck. the whore screams and Lestat's other hand clamps over her mouth. Lestat drags her towards him. Louis falls to the ground, supported no more, insensible. Close on his face, as we hear the last breaths of life of the whore, off.
5) 3) dialog: They would have killed you -
5) 5) dialog: You want death? Is it death you want?
5) 9) dialog: Floats higher, with Louis in his arms, draining his blood. One hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging from a shipmast. The other holds Louis. He withdraws his teeth, and looks into Louis' drained face.
5) 10) dialog: You still want death? Or have you tasted it enough? Louis can barely get the words out.
8) 0) text: Louis is delirious in a four-poster bed, shrouded with mosquito netting. A female slave, YVETTE, bathes his face with a rag. She is crying. Other slave women hover in the shadows. Yvette puts out all candles save one by the bed, and withdraws, with the others. Candlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin. Louis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring incoherently. Then he opens his eyes. LESTAT, exquisitely dressed in French clothing, stands by the bed smiling. In the light of the candle we see that he is not human; skin too white; eyes too bright. Lestat looks amiable, even mischievous, but impossible - and angel or monster. Louis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it.
8) 2) dialog: And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it? Louis takes aim. Lestat puts his hand over the barrel. Louis fires. The bullet tears a hole in Lestat's hand. Lestat is unfazed. He takes the gun from Louis' hand and throws it away. His hand begins to heal.
8) 3) dialog: You're not afraid of anything, are you?
8) 5) dialog: Are you going to put that through me too? Ruin my beautiful clothes? He comes closer to Louis, right up to his face, so the sword passes through his waistcoat.
8) 6) dialog: Were all last night's promises for nothing? He reaches out with his now-healed hand and plucks out the sword.
8) 8) dialog: I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it? Lestat sits down on the bed, drawing up one knee. Louis is becoming spellbound.
8) 9) dialog: The wine has no taste. The food sickens you. There seems no reason for any of it, does there? But what if I could give it back to you? Pluck out the pain and give you another life? And it would be for all time? And sickness and death could never touch you again? The vampire theme rises, with the sound of a heartbeat.
9) 1) dialog: Vampires, that's what we are. Creatures of darkness, only we see it that darkness more clearly than any mortal has ever seen... Louis and Lestat drifting, dreamlike, through the overhanging vines, comes to the grave of his wife and child. Above the crypt, the statue of angel, mother and child.
9) 2) dialog: Wouldn't it be sweet to bid pain goodbye? To wave away anguish and grief? To embrace the peace of the unending night? The marble fingers of the child on the statue move. The angel raises her head and has the face of Louis wife, Diane. she raises her hand and touches Louis tear- streamed face. The child speaks.
9) 5) dialog: They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...

10) 3) dialog: Vampires. We thrive on blood.
10) 5) dialog: Tomorrow night. You must prove yourself. I will give you the choice I never had. He looks outside.
10) 6) dialog: The sun's coming up. Watch it carefully. If you come with me tomorrow, you'll never see it again. He leaves. Louis sits dazed, staring at the empty French window. The sun rises with unnatural beauty, over the swamplands and the plantation, filling the room, striking water-pitcher, glass, mirror, and the picture of his dead wife.
11) 0) text: Lestat and Louis walk through the slave quarters, huddles groups around fires, music, singing. The sound of whipping is heard.
11) 1) dialog: Your grief has unhinged you. You've let your estate rot. In the woods beyond the quarters, the white overseer is whipping a black slave, with horrifying savagery.
11) 2) dialog: You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
11) 4) dialog: Call him. Louis calls.
11) 6) dialog: Why the bloody whip, Carlos? The overseer looks into his eyes, shivers with terror, drops the whip and runs for the trees. Lestat is on him in an instant. He sinks is teeth in his neck. Louis runs to him, tries to pull him off. But Lestat turns to Louis and smiles, with his bloodied mouth.
11) 7) dialog: Let's call that a start.
11) 9) dialog: You've just done it -
12) 1) dialog: Sitting collected at the head of the steps.
12) 3) dialog: Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
12) 5) dialog: (gently)
12) 8) dialog: Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
12) 10) dialog: Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive. Louis takes out his flask and drinks. Drunkenly, he turns and heads for a nearby swamp.
13) 0) text: Louis stops again in front of the crypt. Drinks from the flask, leans his forehead against the stone. Lestat appears beside him, radiant, beautiful.
13) 1) dialog: You really want to be with them?
13) 3) dialog: You asked for death. I didn't promise it - In a quiet rage, Lestat raise his fist and shatters the marble face stone, revealing a coffin below. His fist shatters that in turn, revealing the half-rotted body of a women, holding an infant, no longer recognizable as individuals, a tangle of gruesome rotted hair, flesh, eaten away lace, insects and worms crawling over it. Louis gasps.
13) 4) dialog: It's not your wife and child my friend. It's death. Just that simple. Think and choose. It happens to everyone. Except us. Lestat stares at him, smiling, becoming a hazy dreamlike vision, then hyperclear. Louis again is spellbound. He drops the flask, which shatters on the stones. Lestat appears angelic in his radiance.
13) 5) dialog: We shall be this way always, my friend. Young as we are now. I'm lonely for a companion, lonely for your strength. But I'm not that lonely. Do you want to come or not? Louis capitulates in one long sigh.
13) 7) dialog: Did I hear a yes?
13) 11) dialog: I've drained you to the point of death. If you drink from me you live for ever. If I leave you here you die. Lestat lifts his hand to his lips and blows Louis a kiss.
13) 13) dialog: You're sure?
13) 15) text: Vampire vision. The world is transformed, the swamp, the moon, the clouds, the cry of the night birds all come to him with unnatural clarity. He looks down with pity at the corpses of his wife and child who appear beautiful in death now rather than repulsive. He closes the lid of the coffin and replaces it in the ground, astonished at the ease of it. He turns and stares at Lestat whom he sees now with vampire's vision. Lestat's eyes are brighter, his buttons are glimmering in the light. Everything is clearer, brighter, containing more facets of light and color.
13) 16) dialog: Stop staring at my buttons. Didn't I tell you it was going to be fun? Lestat leads him into the swamp. Everything astonished Louis, as if he's never seen it before. Louis is suddenly racked by shudders of pain.
13) 17) dialog: You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
13) 19) dialog: It happens to us all. Lestat wipes Louis' brow.
13) 20) dialog: Come, you're going to feed now.
13) 22) dialog: That doesn't matter anymore, Louis. You'll see. Come...
13) 24) dialog: They're all beautiful now. Men, women, the old, the young...simply because they are alive. - The slave walks towards them in the darkness. A crucifix gleams round his neck.
13) 25) dialog: Take him.
13) 27) dialog: Forget the crucifix. Take him. Louis hesitates.
13) 28) dialog: Resist no more Louis. Feed... The slave looks up and sees them. Two gleaming white beings standing before him with devil's eyes. The he runs. Louis can resist him no more. He swoops on him with a vampire's rapid movement, brings him to the ground and sinks his teeth in his neck. Close on Louis feeding on the slave, the magnificent body shuddering in its death-throes. Lestat stands above, laughing. The slave dies. Louis rises from him, drunkenly, engorged with blood.
13) 30) dialog: You have fed. You were made for this... Louis looks down at the body of the slave. Lestat's laughter echoes around him.

17) 3) dialog: Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
19) 0) text: A brick walled storage room. Two coffins stand on the floor. Lestat enters with a lantern, Louis behind. Lestat is apprehensive and protective of Louis. He pulls back one lid ot reveal a satin interior.
19) 1) dialog: You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
19) 3) dialog: The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too. Louis approaches the coffin, hands trembling as he peers into it.
19) 4) dialog: Don't be afraid. In moments you'll be sleeping as soundly as you ever slept. And when you awake I'll be waiting for you, and so will all the world. Louis crawls into the coffin, fearful yet fascinated.
19) 6) dialog: Someday I'll tell you. We have a lot of time to talk to each other. You might say... we have all the time we shall ever need. He closes the lid. Total darkness. Sounds of Louis' panicked breathing. Of his prayer again.
20) 0) text: Louis and Lestat sitting at a sumptuous table, piled with uneaten food. Lestat is going through sheafs of documents.
20) 2) dialog: Your wealth, dear Louis, is inestimable. Your income from cotton alone will keep us in comfort for a century. Louis just stares at him.
20) 4) dialog: You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
20) 7) dialog: Au contraire, my dear. He could eat a horse... Lestat laughs loudly. Louis turns and looks at Yvette. Her beautiful forehead in the candlelight, the veins pulsing on her neck and her hands.
20) 11) dialog: Can't you pretend, you fool? Don't give the game away. We're lucky to have such a home. His hand snakes out under the table. It comes up holding a large grey rat.
20) 12) dialog: Pretend to drink, at least. He bares his fangs and slices the rat's throat. He pours the blood into a crystal glass.
20) 13) dialog: Such fine crystal shouldn't go to waste... He hands the glass to Louis. Louis drinks the blood and stares at it in surprise, then at the dead rat on the fine lace tablecloth.
20) 14) dialog: I know. It gets cold so fast.
20) 16) dialog: I wouldn't call it living. I'd call it surviving. A useful trick if you're caught for a month on a ship at sea. Lestat strokes the belly of the dead rat, studying it sadly.
20) 17) dialog: There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
20) 19) dialog: Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle - He throws the rat away.
20) 21) dialog: Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport! He rises. Louis follows.
21) 3) dialog: You think so, cherie? But what if I'd rather taste your lips?

22) 0) text: A crowded street. Louis and Lestat emerge from the tavern. Louis looks up at the moon.
22) 2) dialog: Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them. They walk down the crowded night street, full of ladies in their finery, freed slaves, whores, sailors etc.
23) 2) dialog: The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
23) 4) dialog: Read her thoughts.
23) 6) dialog: The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along. He leads Louis closer to them.
23) 7) dialog: Take my word for it. She blamed a slave for his murder. And do you know what they did to him? He smiles at the young man, who smiles in return.
23) 8) dialog: The evildoers are easier. And they taste better...

25) 5) text: Louis throws himself on Lestat with extraordinary force, pummeling him towards the trees.
25) 7) dialog: I don't know any hell - Louis hurls him against tree after tree with a strength he never knew he had.
25) 9) dialog: What strength, my friend, what strength. I remember why I chose you now. Lestat squirms from his grip, seemingly effortlessly.
25) 10) dialog: But you can't kill me, Louis. Nor I you. He ruffles Louis' hair, with wry affection.
25) 11) dialog: Feed on what you want, mon cherie. Rats, chickens, doves, goats. I'll leave you to it and watch you come round. Just remember, life without me would be even more unbearable... He smiles. A sly, pleasurable secret secret smile.

34) 7) dialog: Why? Why should I know these things? Do you know them? The drumming grows outside.
34) 8) dialog: (gripping his temples)
34) 11) dialog: Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendor!
34) 13) dialog: Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know. Louis stares. Lestat turns childishly, petulantly.
34) 14) dialog: You'll soon run out of chickens, Louis... He walks out, humming a French aria. Louis stares at his plate.
35) 0) text: The slaves, gathered on mass around fires. Frenzied drumming, dancing. Lestat rides through, scattering the flames. The drumming stops. The slaves look towards the house. Slowly, they begin to move towards it.
38) 0) text: Louis, wandering from room to room of the burning mansion. he sees paintings of his wife consumed by the flames. He is weakening with the fumes, the heat. We can see this in his face, the texture of his skin. Suddenly a large french window cascades inwards and Lestat stands there, whip in hand. Behind him we can see the morning sky.
38) 1) dialog: You fool, what have you done?
39) 0) text: With many crypts. Louis, unconscious, carried over Lestat's shoulder.
40) 2) dialog: Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough? Louis laughs softly.
40) 4) dialog: And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
43) 0) text: A lavish little supper chamber with coffered bed, fancy French furniture. Open to rooftops of colonial city. Louis sits by an open window looking out over the city. Behind, we can hear the laughter of Lestat and tow female voices. Louis turns and sees - Lestat, in the main chamber with two drugged or drunked whores. One runs her finger down his chest. The other seems out of it.
43) 2) dialog: Not always... He presses his thumb on her neck and holds her tight, sinking his teeth into her neck. After a time she falls to the bed, dead. he turns to the other.
43) 3) dialog: Your friend has no head for wine.
43) 5) dialog: Do you think so? He rubs her breast.
43) 7) dialog: Ah, but the price is pretty high. Your sweet friend - I exhausted her. He bites her in turn, drinks her blood. She does into the swoon. Louis looks on in disgust. He stands.
43) 9) dialog: What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
43) 11) dialog: What do you imagine you are Louis?
43) 13) dialog: Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God. The girl moans.
43) 15) dialog: Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment. The girl moans again, open her eyes.
43) 17) dialog: I know. Let her alone. He slashes her wrist with his teeth, and lets the blood drip into a glass.
43) 18) dialog: You think you can be human. You think you can go back. But you can't. You live off the blood of rats now Louis. How human is that? The girls moans again. Lestat drinks that glass.
43) 19) dialog: Lie still, love... The girl begins to scream. Lestat picks her up.
43) 20) dialog: You're tired love, you want to sleep. He walks to his coffin, puts her inside and sits on the lid. We hear muffled screaming and banging from inside.

43) 28) dialog: But it's too late, love. Look at your wrist, you breast. He picks her up again. He turns to Louis laughing.
43) 29) dialog: Unless I make her one of us...
43) 32) dialog: 
43) 35) dialog: In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you. Louis leaves without a word.
45) 4) dialog: Ah, my philosopher, my martyr. "Never take a human life". Well you must admit it is funny. Or is it merely touching? I'm not sure. Louis stares at the unconscious Claudia in horror, then lets her slip gently into a chair. Shamefully he wipes his mouth, sees the tiny wounds on her throat. Lestat snatches up the dead mother from the chair and begins to dance with her in great circles, humming and talking. Her head falls back. Black water flows from her mouth.
45) 5) dialog: Let's make some party of it, shall we? Maybe there's some life in the old lady yet? Louis flees into the street.

49) 4) dialog: Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
49) 6) dialog: That and more. He puts his arm around Louis, to stop his shivering.
49) 7) dialog: Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
49) 9) dialog: Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child. Louis is baffled. He follows.

50) 5) dialog: You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
50) 7) dialog: Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive. Lestat shakes her gently.
50) 8) dialog: Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
50) 10) dialog: That's it dear. More. You must drink it to get well. Claudia sucks on the wound, reviving, making little noises like a person waking from sleep. Louis rises to his feet as Claudia clutches Lestat's arm, sucking the blood fiercely. Lestat moans.
50) 11) dialog: Stop, that's enough. No more. He pulls her loose and she growls and stares at him with big clear astonished eyes.
50) 15) dialog: Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again. Still suffering, Lestat pulls the bell-rope.

50) 20) dialog: That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops. He lets the dead maid onto the floor. Claudia looks at the corpse.
50) 22) dialog: It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child. Lestat and Claudia sit on the Louis XVI settee. Claudia is a vision, a doll made out of pearl. Animated, voice crisp.
