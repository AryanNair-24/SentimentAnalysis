97) 19) dialog: He looks like an angel.
97) 20) dialog: You are all right. He reaches into his waistcoat, takes an engraved invitation out of his pocket and thrusts it at Louis. Louis reads it aloud, as we see:
97) 22) dialog: Bring the petit beauty with you. No one will harm you. I won't allow it. Remember my name. Armand. Armand bows and vanishes. Louis listens to the silence.
98) 40) text: We realize she is looking past Santiago at the divinely beautiful Armand, who has just stepped out of the wings. Armand has entranced her. He passes Santiago. Santiago stiffens, but yields the stage.
98) 41) dialog: No pain.
98) 43) dialog: Your beauty is a gift to us.
98) 45) dialog: Who deserves such a gift? He pulls the drawstring from her skirt and it falls revealing her nakedness. But she is spellbound.
99) 0) text: Armand leading, Louis and Claudia following. It opens into a -
99) 4) dialog: Yes, and very beautiful.
99) 6) dialog: They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed. The boy is watching Louis. Armand's hand beckons and the boy draws up to Louis in the candlelight. He places his arms on Louis' shoulders. Louis glances at Armand, who smiles. Louis sees the puncture marks on the boy's neck.
99) 7) dialog: He wants you... Louis is utterly confused. Can't resist. Drinks his blood. The boy's body presses against him, sensual, willing. The other vampires appear all around Louis, who suddenly senses it and draws away, ashamed. Claudia watches warily, from a distance. Armand beckons at her and Louis and open a door in the wall which reveals a stone staircase.
100) 0) text: Medieval chairs, table, an old coffin, a bed in one corner, a blazing fire. A medieval painting of Satan, being banished from heaven, above the fire. Armand places the boy on the bed, settling him so he sleeps.
100) 1) dialog: Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
100) 3) dialog: But how did you come into existence? He glances at Louis, then at Claudia, who averts her eyes.
100) 4) dialog: You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
100) 6) dialog: If there were a leader, I would be the one. Claudia stares at him constantly, guarded.
100) 8) dialog: Ah! You have questions?
100) 10) dialog: Nothing if not vampires...
100) 12) dialog: Surely you know the one who made you...
100) 14) dialog: That is a picture, nothing more.
100) 16) dialog: No. He smiles at Louis. A smile of infinite compassion.
100) 17) dialog: I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
100) 19) dialog: Perhaps... He passes his finger through the candle flame.
100) 20) dialog: And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
100) 22) dialog: I have not spoken to him...
100) 24) dialog: None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world. He stares at them, his face angelic, hypnotic, young. His eyes hold them both in a trance.
100) 26) dialog: You fell too much. So much you make me feel... He stares from Claudia to Louis. He seems to be reading their souls.
100) 27) dialog: The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
100) 29) dialog: Knew? You mean he is... Claudia appears suddenly to Louis' shoulder, interrupting.
100) 31) dialog: So soon to go? He seems genuinely regretful. But Claudia pulls Louis out.
106) 0) text: Armand opens the door to Louis' knock.
106) 1) dialog: I was waiting for you...
106) 4) dialog: Your lover.
106) 6) dialog: If you say so. You are innocent.
106) 8) dialog: She is.
106) 10) dialog: I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
106) 12) dialog: Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
106) 14) dialog: It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
106) 16) dialog: So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
106) 18) dialog: But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
106) 20) dialog: You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
106) 22) dialog: How he must have loved you. Armand suddenly grips Louis close to him.
106) 23) dialog: Louis, I need you more than he ever did. I need a link with this century. The world changes. We do not. Therein lies the irony that ultimately kills us. I need you to make contact with this age. Louis laughs bitterly.
106) 25) dialog: But Louis, that is the very spirit of your age. The heart of it. You fall from grace has been the fall of a century. Louis is stunned.
106) 27) dialog: Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart. Louis is speechless.
106) 28) dialog: Are these not the answers you came for?
106) 31) dialog: A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you -
106) 33) dialog: Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing. Armand stands. He takes Louis by the arm, leads him towards the back wall.
106) 34) dialog: But you must go now. You must get her safely out of Paris. He opens a hidden door in the wall.
106) 35) dialog: No-one else knows of this door. When you knock you will find me waiting...
116) 1) dialog: Above him, reaching down to take his hand.
116) 2) dialog: Hurry. Don't make a sound. Louis gets out, into a vast long catacomb. Louis runs to the end of it, steps through a broken brick wall.
116) 4) dialog: Follow me - that way - through my cell - He points to his cell at the end of the passage, the foot of the steps. Sound of rain beyond the door.
116) 6) dialog: I can't save her.
116) 8) dialog: Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you - Louis runs up the stone stairs. It leads to the ballroom. He enters. Estelle stands far off, looking at him coolly. She lifts the stage skull mask and laughs softly behind it. A male vampire slumps in a chair staring softly at Louis. Silence. Indifference. Louis sees Lestat sitting in a far corner. he rushes up to Lestat, who looks up at him, confused. He's holding something crumpled, made of cloth.
117) 0) text: On the stones lie Claudia and Madeleine, burn to ashes, in each other's arms, like the corpses of his wife and daughter in the New Orleans graveyard, embracing each other. Only Claudia's blond hair and Madeleine's red hair remain unburnt. Louis looks up at the walls of this airwell, many stories to the sky. He cries out in agony. Santiago appears behind him, staring. Louis roars in horror and attacks Santiago, scattering the ashes into the rainy wind. Claudia's golden locks fly up into the wind, they whirl around the warring figure. Armand appears, drags Louis free, pulls him screaming from the airwell, into the ballroom, towards the exit. Claudia's hair is sucked up by the wind through the airwell, towards the night sky.
118) 0) text: Louis is slumped against the stone wall. Armand stands beside him like a guardian angel.
118) 1) dialog: I couldn't prevent it.
118) 3) dialog: Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
118) 6) dialog: Louis, I swear I did not.
125) 0) text: It is already a museum by this time and Louis and Armand, fancily dressed and composed, walk through it. They stop by a Gericault - The Wreck of the Medusa.
125) 2) dialog: No.
125) 4) dialog: I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
125) 6) dialog: You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes. He looks at Louis affectionately.
125) 7) dialog: Your melancholy eyes...
125) 9) dialog: We are a pair, and that's what counts. Armand and Louis walk slowly through the Louvre together. Camera follows them for a while, then comes to rest on a sunrise by Turner.
126) 0) text: A deco cinema of the twenties. Louis and Armand, dressed in the style of the period walk down the aisle through the crowded seats.
