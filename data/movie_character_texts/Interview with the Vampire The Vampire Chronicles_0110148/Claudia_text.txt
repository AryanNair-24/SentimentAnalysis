76) 7) dialog: I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
76) 9) dialog: You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
76) 11) dialog: I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were. Louis perks up, puzzled.
76) 13) dialog: Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
76) 15) dialog: Better than that. She takes his hand and leads him into an inner room. Louis follows behind.
76) 16) dialog: You haven't fed enough. I can tell by your color.
77) 2) dialog: Drunk on brandy wine. A thimbleful. I thought of you when I saw them.

77) 11) dialog: I'll put you in your coffin. Forever. She pulls a knife out from under her shawl, walks rapidly to him and slashes his throat. Blood explodes from it.
77) 15) dialog: Louis! Look what's happening to him!! Louis looks. The floor is a sea of blood. Lestat has begun to shrivel, as if he'd been a bag of blood. His skin is shriveling against his bones like parchment, his eyes are slipping back into his skull-like face. His lush, beautiful hair remains unchanged. But his clothes are virtually being emptied of the body. It is no more than bones, wrapped in paper and the pupils of the eyes suddenly roll up into the papered skull.
77) 17) dialog: Don't mock me, Louis. Help me. She stares at the shriveled skeleton in its skin wrapping. She is fascinated. She sees the vampiric blood flow all over the floor. She touches it and brings her finger to her lips.
77) 18) dialog: Goodnight, sweet prince, may flights of devils wing you to your rest. Louis walks forward, touches the skeleton, the blonde hair.
77) 20) dialog: The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead. She stands up, all business suddenly.
77) 21) dialog: Help me. We must get rid of him. She drags the coverlet from the table, knocking the crockery over the dead youths, and wraps Lestat's skeleton in it. She takes a bunch of chrysanthemums and places them in his skeleton hands.

78) 8) dialog: Louis, look at me.
78) 10) text: I can't. Go away from me. Claudia is shocked to her core. She steps back. Louis stares at the rippling waters. Gradually the movement of alligators stops. Then he hears a sound he hasn't heard in years. Soft, choking. He turns, sees Claudia sitting by a cypress tree, like a little girl for the first time in years. She is weeping copiously.
78) 12) dialog: You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
78) 14) dialog: I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died. Louis gathers her in his arms.

95) 9) dialog: You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
95) 11) dialog: Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love? Louis is stunned. He blushes.
95) 12) dialog: You don't remember? Or you never knew.

98) 37) dialog: Even she is repelled by the cruelty. She shakes her head.
98) 49) dialog: Be still!
98) 51) text: The audience, milling towards the exits. They talk in vacuous terms about the beauty of the show, the symbolism of it, the daring of it as they leave. Gradually Louis and Claudia are left alone in the empty theatre. Louis seems anxious to leave. Claudia whispers in his ear.

108) 9) dialog: Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
108) 11) dialog: Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me. She points to Madeleine
108) 12) dialog: You give her to me! Do this before you leave me! She begins to weep, sobbing like a child.

Only Claudia's blond hair and Madeleine's red hair remain unburnt. Louis looks up at the walls of this airwell, many stories to the sky. He cries out in agony. Santiago appears behind him, staring. Louis roars in horror and attacks Santiago, scattering the ashes into the rainy wind. Claudia's golden locks fly up into the wind, they whirl around the warring figure. Armand appears, drags Louis free, pulls him screaming from the airwell, into the ballroom, towards the exit. Claudia's hair is sucked up by the wind through the airwell, towards the night sky.
