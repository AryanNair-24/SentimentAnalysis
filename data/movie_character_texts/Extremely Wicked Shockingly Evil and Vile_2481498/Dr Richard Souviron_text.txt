114) 0) text: DR. RICHARD SOUVIRON, handsome, 50s, in a dapper vest-sui and goatee, directs a pointer over an oversized, double- panel, color blowup of TEETH -- Ted’s teeth. He’s the state’s biggest gun and has a flair for the theatrical.
114) 1) dialog: (indicating on the photos) These are laterals... bicuspids... (MORE )
114) 3) dialog: incisors... (to jury) Each individual’s teeth have particular characteristics that make them unique -- alignment, irregularities, chips, size, sharpness... Souviron opens another double-panel (which we don’t see).
114) 4) dialog: This is an enlarged photograph of the victim Lisa Levy’s buttocks. (using the pointer) You can see the double bite. The individual bit once, then turned sideways and bit a second time. The top teeth stayed in about the same position, but the lower teeth, biting harder, left two rings.
114) 6) dialog: Yes sir. They made the marks. A collective gasp erupts throughout the court.
114) 9) dialog: I think that’s a fair statement.
114) 11) dialog: Yes. 89.
114) 13) dialog: That is correct.
114) 15) dialog: (smiles) Yes, because I did an experiment just like that. I took models and I went to the morgue and I pressed the models into the buttocks area on different individuals and photographed them. Yes, they can be standardized, and, yes, they do match.
114) 17) dialog: I couldn't find any live volunteers.
114) 19) dialog: If there’s an area of inconsistency, out it goes. But the odds of finding an identical set -- with the wear on the centrals, the chipped lateral incisor, everything identical -- would be astronomical.
114) 21) dialog: A very high degree of probability. It becomes a practical impossibility.
114) 23) dialog: No. I don’t think that’s fair at all. Historically, you have a case of Paul Revere doing identifications, you have testimony admitted to the bar in Massachusetts in the late 1800s, and you can find citations for bite mark cases in the legal justice system that go back twenty-five years. So what’s new?
