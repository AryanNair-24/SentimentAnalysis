Inside, behind the reflections of the city lights, all the TV sets are showing the same picture, the glittering image of a woman singing. (We will recognize the woman as Rachel Marron.) We cut tighter and tighter on the image until it is almost broken up into its scanning lines. Through the city noise comes the sound of her song "I have Nothing."
2) 0) text: A battered old desk.  Scattered across the top -- a pile of blank white paper, a jar of glue, a stack of magazines, a pair of scissors, a TV remote control, softly in the b.g., a TV is playing the same image we saw in the store window, the same song. Hands appear. Male hands. They open a drawer and remove a pair of translucent rubber gloves. Carefully they put t gloves on. The SNAPPING of the rubber is the only sound. The hands pick a magazine off the stack: Screen Stars. They put the magazine down and pick up the scissors. A headline on the cover reads: "RACHEL MARRON'S GREATEST TRIUMPH!" The scissors start to cut. Meticulously they excise the name "RACHEL MARRON" from the page. With the care of a surgeon.
3) 0) text: A tumultuous crash of screaming, pushing bodies. Arms stretch out, cameras flash, sunguns flare, microphones are thrust forward. A deafening cacophony of "Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Over here! Over here! This way, Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!" We cannot see the object of this frenzy. We catch a brief glimpse of an attractive, well-dressed young woman (NICKI), exiting with the other celebrities, as she is pushed and casually jostled aside by the mass of surging fans and media. Her face is calm and impassive as she watches from the sidelines.

An old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back and forth over the freshly cut grass.  Throwing knives lay scattered nearby. A wooden post is  sticking out of the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard. BILL DEVANEY, fiftyish, a distinguished-looking black gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage Frank in a conversation that up to this point hasn't been going well He's Rachel's personal manager.

He is crouched at the side of the pool with the remote control unit for a foot-long speedboat which is cutting across the water. A nanny sits, some way off, embroidering. Frank's attention is distracted. A heavier BASS MUSICAL BEAT comes from somewhere nearby in the house, another Rachel Marron number, but this time up-tempo and bouncy. Frank follows the sound.

Occasionally one will have a photo of Rachel with crude markings on it Spector enters sucking on a popsicle. He comes to stand over Frank's shoulder, peering nonchalantly at the piles of letters.

34) 0) text: The room is dark. An opaque projector throws an image onto a screen; it is a letter threatening Rachel's life. We hear voices. One is Frank's; the other two belong to special agents RAY COURT and TERRY MINELLA. The letter is one of the pasted-up threats we saw being assembled earlier. It reads:

Frank stands nearby with Nicki. The Woman says something to Rachel, who turns and looks at Frank. Rachel whispers something to the Woman and they both laugh. They kiss and Rachel moves toward the entrance.
36) 3) text: Goodbye, Nicki. So great to see you. Nicki waves and follows Rachel. Frank stays very close without seeming to walk with Rachel. A little girl darts into their path and approaches Rachel Rachel glances at Frank, who has stopped with her, then she signs an autograph for the girl. The girl's mother, close behind her, hands a small camera casually to Nicki to be photographed as she and her daughter pose with Rachel. Frank watches Nicki quietly comply. Rachel, Spector and Frank all reach the front entrance together, and Frank slips out first, glancing around. Rachel comes out and passes within inches of him.

48) 6) text: (to Frank, indicating the open booth) Farmer, do you want to come in here with me? Just to be safe? Frank glances at her, then resumes his surveillance of the shop. Rachel's head bobs up and down above the curtain as she changes. RACHEL
48) 7) text: You probably won't believe this, but I have a reputation for being a bitch. Frank says nothing. He gazes outside through the store- front window and sees Henry and Tony horsing around next to the limo. A few small boys stand around the car. One of them is climbing onto the hood. RACHEL
48) 8) text: I didn't used to be. But you get known for being a certain way -- a way people think you are -- and pretty soon you get like that. Can't help it. Frank smiles knowingly.   Rachel notices. RACHEL
48) 10) text: I've seen a few. RACHEL
48) 12) text: (very flat) You can be as you choose to be. It's an act of discipline sometimes, but it can be done. Rachel stops in her tracks... then opens the curtains and looks at herself in the mirror. Also reflected in the mirror is Frank. RACHEL
48) 15) text: (without interest) That's right. Rachel turns to Frank. RACHEL
48) 17) text: You're too clever for me.   I can't keep up. Frank continues to search the shop and street with his gaze. Rachel steps closer to him. RACHEL
48) 18) text: Look at me, Farmer! Frank turns and looks at her. RACHEL
48) 20) text: Disapproval's a luxury I can't afford. Gets in the way. RACHEL
48) 22) text: That's right. It's a stand-off. After a moment, Rachel motions to an outfit on a rack just behind him. RACHEL
48) 24) text: I'm here to keep you alive... not to help you shop. Fuming, Rachel sizes things up, then grabs it herself, whipping the curtain shut behind her. A smile plays across Frank's face.
49) 1) text: Frank sits alone in his room, lit by the glow of the TV, dressed in a business-style blue suit and tie. He's watching Rachel's videos. Scattered around the video player are a collection of other Rachel Marron CD's, tapes and videos. Frank has been noting down lyrics on the yellow legal pad on his lap. Some of the phrases are circled. As he watches, we see a subtle change in his expression. It is as if he really were looking at Rachel for the firs time, here, watching her sing. For a second, she seems to be singing to him alone, passionate and vulnerable. He opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled Russian Orthodox-type cross. He fastens the clasp, checking that it holds, then looks back to the screen.

51) 0) text: The room is surprisingly bare and simple, almost empty apart from Rachel's collection of old and faded dolls on the shelves and on the bed. Rachel is getting dressed for the evening. A hairdresser stands behind her, fussing with her hair. Rachel hears the MUSIC coming from outside and moves to the window. (The hairdresser moves with her, still busy with the brush.) Gazing across the garden, she sees the light in Frank's room and hears her own voice singing out from there too.

Many are grotesquely painted. Some go into a wild frenzy as Rachel's limo pulls up. There is a punch-up and a man is beaten back. Someone has a video camera. Its quartz light shines in through the limo windows. Everybody squints at the glare.

61) 0) text: Frank guides Rachel toward the stage exit. A roar from the audience begins. "Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!" It grows louder as they near the exit. Rachel's expression is a combination of fear and humiliation. When they have almost reached the exit, she stops.

62) 3) dialog: Bill Devaney, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Bill. Hey, everyone. Hello! Isn't Billy Thomas the greatest. He's asked me to sing a song. I hope you don't mind. The crowd roars its approval. Frank nervously scans the room. Rachel smiles and moves along the stage. MUSIC starts in the b.g. Masking obvious fear, she starts to sing. As she takes one hand from the microphone, her fingers tremble. She clasps it again to hide her anxiety.

65) 6) dialog: (dancing, talking)
65) 7) text: I want to dance... She skitters to the other side of the stage, baiting her fans. Her new video explodes across the video wall behind her. The crowd surges forward. Two security guards nervously tense up, watching the crowd. When one fan tries to climb onstage, Frank reaches out and unbalances him, so that the man falls back into the audience. Another man climbs the stage on the other side. One of the guards darts out like a ballboy at a tennis match, pushes the fan back and scurries to the far side to resume his vigilance. The crowd is getting even more excited, pressing closer, trying to touch Rachel. The security guards move in, but Rachel gestures for them to back off.
65) 9) text: Looking offstage at Frank. His frustration is almost intoxicating to her. She struts over the lip of the stage. A man leaps up from audience to join her. Frank starts forward. Rachel gestures to him to hold back, waving him off.
67) 0) text: Rachel dances erotically with the man -- bumping and grinding, sinking to her knees. The crowd roars approval. Frank quickly sizes up the scene. He speaks into a SURV KIT microphone in his sleeve. Across the room we see Henry listening, pushing an earpiece to his ear. Henry quickly scurries to an exit. Frank starts moving toward the stage. At that moment, the lucky man Rachel's dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her gleefully, like the dance partner she has been pretending to be. One of security guards rushes forward to extri- cate her. The spinning man inadvertently bumps hard into the guard and the man loses his grip on Rachel. She flies out of his grasp and tumbles off the front of the stage -- into the adoring arms of a half dozen fans. The audience goes wild. This is the kind of thing Rachel was famous for when she was starting out. The scene resembles a rugby scrum... with Rachel the ball. Frank sees Rachel being passed over the heads of fans -- deeper into the audience. Her dress is ripped and torn apart. The silver headpiece is dislodged and disappears into the crowd.
67) 1) dialog: Fear fills her face. She's gone over the edge, literally and figuratively. She's lost control. Tony and the security guards are fighting to get to her, slamming bodies out of the way. In the b.g., the video continues on its serene, uninterrupted way.

FOOTSTEPS APPROACH, walking, pausing, as if looking for something. Lying on the floor in big CLOSEUP we see a small  fragmen of Rachel's dress. The FOOTSTEPS STOP by it. A    hand picks it up gently and lifts it OUT OF FRAME. We   hear t sound of a deep lingering INHALATION of breath.   The fee move on.

73) 0) text: Frank moves quickly into the room, checking the window and French door. Rachel waits silently by the door. All is clear. He steps back to the door. As he approaches her she begins to tremble. He gently reaches out and takes her in his arms. Slowly holding her he leads her to bed, moving aside some of Rachel's dolls, laid out on the pillows. Her hands go automatically to her dress but they are shaking so badly she cannot undo it. Frank gently does it for her. She willingly allows him to undress her and not a word is spoken between them. As she sits naked still trembling, he pulls down the covers and guides her gently into bed. As he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of his hand. He looks down, stroking her forehead like a child's.

75) 0) text: Frank has been talking to the uniformed guard in the gate house and now begins walking up the drive toward the man- sion. The grounds are quiet, beautiful, misty. We see him from behind some foliage, as if he's being covertly observed, stalked. A twig snaps and he turns sharply. It's Rachel. She's dressed in a soft jumpsuit and starts jogging out from behind the bushes towards him

75) 7) text: Great.    I guess I can't do it. Rachel stops pumping, gasps for air, and for one moment, rests a hand on Frank's arm to support herself. She removes it quickly. RACHEL
75) 8) text: Will you walk with me a little? Frank nods and they cut off across the grounds. RACHEL
75) 10) text: That would be good. They walk in silence for few moments. When Rachel finally speaks, she sounds genuinely unsure of herself, nervous. It's very appealing. And if it's an act, she's a terrific actress.

As the hands remove the rubber gloves, the inside of the locker is revealed. Pasted over every inch of the locker are pictures of Rachel Marron. One tabloid shot of her dancing with the word "whore" scrawled across it. Taped to a single sheet of white paper in the center, like a holy relic, is the torn scrap of Rachel's dress from the MAYAN. The hands pin up the newly-acquired photo next to it.

81) 36) dialog: So, is this a full service date, Frank? Frank's wary.
81) 37) dialog: I'm just asking you to dance.
82) 0) text: Frank and Rachel navigate a tiny dance floor. Frank is a surprisingly good dancer and is comfortable being this close to her. Rachel hums softly, picking up the words to the song.   A we listen to the lyrics something clicks in her head.
82) 1) dialog: You like this?
82) 6) dialog: (trying to compose herself)
82) 9) text: It is, isn't it. Suddenly a dish drops to the floor. Frank, still dancing, makes a smooth quick turn that puts his body between Rachel and the noise. His head turns to locate the source of the noise.
82) 10) dialog: Don't worry, I'll protect you. They drift back into the music, Rachel singing, Frank watching.
84) 0) text: Frank hangs back, drink in hand, as Rachel explores the basement. Frank has fitted it out as a combination gym/ target range/weapons workshop. The place has a kind of unfussy order about it, a simplicity.
84) 1) dialog: (almost to herself)
84) 3) dialog: (reading)
84) 5) dialog: What'd you play?
84) 7) text: End. RACHEL
84) 9) text: No.    Fast. Rachel puts down her drink and moves toward a samurai sword that is mounted in its scabbard on the wall. She looks at it, peering closely. RACHEL
84) 10) text: You some kind of a samurai, too? Frank smiles. RACHEL
84) 12) text: Money. Rachel looks around at Frank's modest home. RACHEL
84) 13) text: I can see your tastes are extravagant. She looks at Frank and then back at the sword.   She reaches out to touch it. RACHEL
84) 14) text: May I? Frank nods. Rachel takes it off its mount carefully, unhooks the scabbard and begins to slide it off. FRANK
84) 15) text: Watch yourself. Rachel slides the scabbard off. The naked blade is breathtaking. Rachel holds the sword out before her. She walks toward Frank, then stops and looks over the blade at him. RACHEL
84) 18) dialog: It seems to me a bodyguard must know little peace. Frank stands up so that the point of the sword is only about an inch from his chest. He reaches out over the blade to Rachel's neck and unties the silk scarf she is wearing there. One hand draws the scarf away. The other hand lingers for a moment on her neck, then lifts away.
86) 1) dialog: I've never been this safe before. Frank smiles.
86) 2) dialog: No one could get by you.
87) 0) text: The roller-blind is raised with a sharp, snapping sound. Frank is moving around the room, getting dressed. Rachel
87) 2) text: What? What is it? What are you doing? Frank keeps moving, looking for his shoes. RACHEL
87) 4) text: Rachel, I don't want to get confused about what I'm doing here. RACHEL
87) 6) text: You pay me to protect you, that's what I do. Rachel sits up. RACHEL
87) 8) text: No, nothing. RACHEL
87) 9) text: Then what is it? She lifts the sheet seductively and looks over the top of it. RACHEL
87) 11) text: No, I want you to do without. She stops. RACHEL
87) 16) text: No, I'm sorry. This is my fault. RACHEL
87) 18) text: You didn't do anything. It was me. I involved myself with my client. Rachel picks up on the word. RACHEL
87) 20) text: I made a mistake. RACHEL
87) 22) text: Christ! I've told you why. I can't protect you like this. RACHEL
87) 24) text: Yeah... RACHEL
87) 26) text: You can live with that or you can fire me. RACHEL
87) 27) text: But I can't fuck you. Frank turns and looks at her.    This is hard for him, to RACHEL
89) 0) text: Frank is investigating the small packet, with a surgeon's precision, checking it with a stethoscope and a metal detector, sniffing at it. It has been addressed in the normal way, except that Rachel's name has been cut out of a magazine and pasted above the address. He begins carefully slicing away the wrapping. Inside is a cardboard box. The contents are still hidden by packing paper. He picks it away with tweezers. Suddenly there is a LOUD BUZZING from the box and movement in the paper. Frank drops the box into a bed of sand in a sink surrounded by sandbags. The movement slows and stops. Frank extracts the item -- it is a wind-up mechanical beaver with a hand-painted sign hung around its neck: WE LOVE YOU, RACHEL YOUR FANS IN BEAVER, PA. SALLY AND KATE.
90) 4) text: What's on my mind is that you're fired, Frank. She missed all her interviews yesterday because of your little date. Do you realize she stood up Barbara Walters? First you fuck up her career... Behind Spector, out of his line of sight, Rachel and Devaney appear in the doorway with more cards. They also stop and listen.
90) 11) text: Frank stays. Spector looks round, sees that Devaney and Rachel have been listening. Rachel is silent. With a curt nod of his head, Spector gestures to the assistants to leave the room. Devaney weighs in. DEVANEY
90) 12) text: With this high a profile, Rachel needs protection now more than ever. If he goes, you can forget Miami... SPECTOR
90) 13) text: She's signed the fucking contract, Bill. You want me to read it to you? Rachel is watching them both. DEVANEY
90) 15) text: Oh. 'Fuck the contract.' Great. Why don't you let Rachel speak for herself? I think she has some say in this. RACHEL
90) 17) text: Mr. Schiller calling on line one... Spector ignores her, still holding his look at Devaney, Rachel and Frank. SPECTOR
90) 20) text: I gave in. That's not easy for me. Don't I get a hug? Rachel is stone-faced.   Spector covers by picking up the phone. SPECTOR
90) 21) text: (into phone) Yeah?... Sure, put him on... Ben how are you?... uh huh... Frank and Rachel look at each other in silence. SPECTOR
90) 22) text: ...The Ambassador? What the hell are you trying to pull, Ben? Rachel always gets the Presidential... I don't care what you thought... Devaney leans to Frank as Spector's conversation continue in the b.g. DEVANEY
90) 28) dialog: (to Frank)
90) 30) dialog: (sweetly)
90) 33) dialog: (across him)
99) 0) text: Behind the glass doors that lead to the pool, bright quartz lights clock on. A camera crew stands waiting. Someone mimes a "we're rolling" sign with his hands. Inside Rachel waits with Spector and BEN SCHILLER, the tough, fat fellow who owns the place. Frank is at her elbow.
99) 4) dialog: Quit bitching, Farmer. This is the part you do get paid for. Rachel sweeps out the door.    The camera crew hurries to keep up with her.
100) 0) text: This place is crowded with hundreds   of guests basking o chaise lounges. A sea of sun-baked    faces virtually as far as the eye can see. The sight    of the crowd and the presence of the news crew seems to   push Rachel to a whole new adrenaline level. Rachel walks among them, moving swiftly, evaluating the bodies displayed before her in words and expressions, playing to the camera.
100) 1) dialog: Oh my God. Look what they're wearing. Mother, hide your eyes... Heads turn to look.
100) 2) dialog: I couldn't wear that suit... Honey, you're naked... Of course, if I had a body like that... There is a murmur of recognition from some of the guests. She pauses to shake a hand, and now all the guests throughout the pool area are aware that Rachel Marron is among them. People stand on chairs, scramble for pens and paper, run
100) 4) text: Great, babe. They got what they needed. Let's get back inside. Frank increases his pace to keep by Rachel's side, gently easing a path for her. Schiller scurries behind in Frank's wake. Rachel turns suddenly as a tall good-looking lifeguard appears in the throng. She eyes him appreciatively. RACHEL
100) 5) text: (to lifeguard) You look like a man of good taste to me. Come to my party tonight. (to Schiller) Ben, make sure this boy gets to my party. Schiller nods. Rachel glances at Frank, making sure he gets the point, and then she's off again. The throng gets tighter. Frank's having to work harder, steering her towards the door back into the hotel. The familiar chant starts up: "Rachel, Rachel." It's starting to resemble the frenzy of the opening scene. This time, amid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces, a few bewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved forward. A child starts crying, lost in the mess of legs and Bermuda shorts. A distraught mother tries to reach him. Someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd surges again. Amid the chaos, whistles and scattered applause.   Rachel drinks it all in. RACHEL
100) 6) text: (over her shoulder) Thank you. Thank you. Come tonight and give till it hurts. With a final surge, Frank makes it to the door with his party. The door closes shut behind them. A mass of distorted faces pushes onto the glass. The party walks on briskly. RACHEL
100) 10) text: Kick me, beat me... whatever makes you feel good. But let's not pretend you don't like it. We're too close for that. Whipping people into a frenzy is why you got into it in the first place. Rachel's eyes lock with  Spector's -- there's a real conn tion and understanding  here that she spends a lot of tim denying. Frank sees it   as clearly as Spector, whose ton becomes almost soothing  --
100) 13) dialog: Now you're going to tell me about magic? Give it a rest will ya...
100) 15) text: ... I know you like to be reminded sometimes. Rachel looks away.   It's true.   He's good at his job.
101) 0) text: In the spotlight, all alone, Rachel Marron works her magi She sings, as it was meant to be sung, "I Have Nothing." One person does not look at Rachel. He stands in a corner in front of the stage easily in the shadows. His eyes continually scanning. Picking up every movement. All alone. Watching.
104) 0) text: Tony sits in a chair watching TV, a drink in his hand, oblivious to all. The lifeguard shuts Rachel's door be- hind him and makes his way down to the party. He pauses at the head of the stairs, checking out the party, and grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. Frank catches the movement; the two men briefly lock eyes. The lifeguard responds with a knowing smile.
106) 8) text: Maybe eighteen. You working? Rachel makes her entrance, and poses self-mocking on the landing above the crowd, accepting applause. She has succeeded in under-dressing everyone in the room. She is a star. Frank nods in her direction... that's his client. PORTMAN
106) 9) text: (impressed) No kidding? I'd call that a step up from the President. Probably sings better too. RACHEL
106) 10) text: Thank you.   Thank you.   You're so right. SCATTERED LAUGHS. RACHEL
106) 11) text: I want everyone to have a good time and drink as much of Ben Schiller's liquor as you like. Rachel descends into the crowd, laughing and blowing kisses. PORTMAN
106) 22) text: No. Only my qualifications for the priesthood. You were always clear about that. Anyway, I appreciate it. I had to turn it down but I appreciate it. Portman notices Rachel looking at him, as she makes her way to them. Rachel takes Frank's orange juice and sips. Makes a very funny face. RACHEL
106) 23) text: That's orange juice! Rachel gives Portman an approving once-over.
106) 24) dialog: Who are you?
106) 27) dialog: I take it you've met my bodyguard?

106) 34) dialog: (to Portman)
106) 37) dialog: Good. (she takes his arm)
107) 0) text: Rachel's taking a breather on the balcony, drinking cham- pagne, talking to Portman and another couple. Everybody's high and happy. Conversation bubbles.
107) 1) text: Rachel leans into Portman; heads together, they whisper intimately. Rachel laughs, then for a brief moment, turns her head to look directly at Frank. Her look is petulant, defiant. Portman does not see this.
109) 0) text: Rachel and Portman are poised precariously halfway over the railing. Frank's hand shoots out, grabs Rachel's wrist and tugs at the pair of them. Portman regains his balance first and pulls Rachel back from the edge.
109) 3) dialog: (looking at Portman)
109) 6) dialog: It's a long way down, Frank. (to Portman)
109) 7) text: You saved my life. Frank eyes the newly-welded anchor fixture.   It has held. Rachel takes Portman by the arm.   The front of her dress is stained with champagne.
109) 8) dialog: Maybe someone will keep an eye on me while I change. She leads Portman past Frank and up the stairs toward her bedroom. Frank and Portman lock eyes. Portman shrugs; he feels badly for Frank.
111) 0) text: Rachel and Portman are kissing, with some heat. Portman's hands are starting to explore her body.
112) 0) text: Frank still looks at Rachel's doorway, thinking. After a moment, he walks across the room to the sliding doors that lead to the balcony outside.
113) 0) text: Frank steps outside. No one there. The moonlight re- flects off the ocean. The SURF sounds a STEADY BEAT. It is peaceful and quiet. A relief. On the Katz's balcony, forty feet away, little Mark Katz is leaning against the railing, staring at Rachel's suite. Frank smiles at him.
114) 0) text: Rachel and Portman are still locked in the clinch. Realizing what she's doing, Rachel suddenly pulls back,
114) 2) dialog: I'm not doing this.
114) 5) dialog: I said I was grateful.   Thank you and good night. She looks to the door that leads back to the party. The SOUNDS of CELEBRATION CONTINUE outside. She starts to cross to the door.
114) 6) dialog: (cool)
114) 7) text: Please go now. Portman moves toward her as she opens the door, reaching for her arm. Then he sees, through the doorway, Tony standing in the hall talking to a woman. Tony looks up at the sound of the door and sees them both. Rachel slips quickly out of Portman's grip.
114) 8) dialog: Mr. Portman was just leaving us, Tony. Portman hesitates, then smiles at Rachel and Tony and, with a quick peck on Rachel's cheek, slips past them back to the party. Rachel briefly scans the party crowd over Tony's shoulder but she doesn't see Frank. The door closes, leaving her alone in the room again. She reaches for a bottle of Scotch and raises it to her mouth, drinking straight from the bottle.
115) 0) text: Frank looks out at the ocean. ECHOING on the soundtrack, we hear the song 'WHAT BECOMES OF THE BROKEN HEARTED' that Rachel and Frank danced to. It sounds slow and sweet and a long way away. Frank stares out at the ocean. Totally divorced from everything in the suite behind him, in the world around him. There is only the moon and the ocean. For this
116) 0) text: A chambermaid is Hoovering the floor. Rachel steps out of her bedroom. She looks terrible. Hungover, she is wearing sunglasses and a loose smock. It is noon of the following day.
117) 0) text: Frank is sitting at the kitchen table eating a sandwich. Behind him, in the dining room, a Cuban maid has set a place with breakfast. She is pouring orange juice as Rachel walks in. Rachel sits down at the table as though the walk in had been a terrible effort. She looks at the breakfast with distaste and picks up the coffee. Frank continues to eat. Rachel looks at him.
117) 1) dialog: (nasty) What the hell are you looking at? (pause) You probably never had a heavy night in your whole, goddamn disciplined life.
117) 3) dialog: You know, Farmer, you're a self- righteous son-of-a-bitch.
117) 4) text: Frank has to smile at this, which makes Rachel even angrier.
117) 5) dialog: Don't laugh at me, goddamit!   And don't you dare judge me.
123) 0) text: Frank is almost at the door. We hear LAUGHTER. A key turns in the lock. Rachel and Tony come through the door in high spirits, their arms full of shopping bags and packages. Frank stops dead and    watches. Rachel glances at him an goes into the living    room. Tony looks at him meaning- fully and follows.     Frank reflects for a moment, then pulls the front door    closed, oh so gently.
124) 0) text: Rachel drops packages around and goes to the bar, pours herself a drink. Tony takes some packages to Rachel's bedroom.
124) 1) dialog: Hello, Devaney.

124) 7) dialog: Farmer, you work here! Do you understand that? You work for me.
124) 11) dialog: Did Fletcher call? Devaney, staring after Frank, shakes his head "no."

130) 2) text: Farmer... Nothing that's happened between us matters... I understand now... You're going to have to believe me, because I'm not going to beg. She takes a long drag on her cigarette. RACHEL
130) 3) text: It wasn't what he said... it was the way he said it... he was so... Her voice cracks.   She stops and tries to compose hersel RACHEL
130) 5) text: I can't protect you like this. It's impossible. The odds are on his side. RACHEL
130) 6) text: I'll do whatever you say. This is the first time Frank has ever heard Rachel say that. He studies her, then looks out at the ocean. FRANK
130) 7) text: I want to take you away for a while. Rachel nods. FRANK
132) 0) text: Herb squats on the floor with Fletcher. Together, they are happily playing around with the fluffy terrier. Fletcher squeals with delight as the dog licks his face. Henry brings the remaining luggage through. Rachel and Nicki stand with Frank near the archway. All eyes are on

133) 2) text: Frank's momma. There's the COUGH and SPUTTER of an outboard MOTOR from outside. Rachel looks from the kitchen window and sees Fletcher and Frank in the small skiff by the dock. Fletcher tugs again on the starter cord.       At the thi tug he tumbles backwards onto the seat.
133) 3) dialog: Fletcher doesn't swim well.
133) 6) dialog: That's right.
133) 10) dialog: It's so quiet here.
133) 13) text: We buried Katherine that day. Rachel looks out again at Frank and Fletcher in the boat.
134) 0) text: Fletcher, Rachel and Frank are chugging across the golden water in the skiff. Fletcher sits at the back, operating the outboard, controlling the movements of the boat. He wears a life vest. Rachel watches him proudly. Fletcher locks the throttle into place and takes his hands off it for a laughing moment with a "Look, Mom, no hands" gesture. Rachel looks to Frank and smiles, the wind blowing her hair.
136) 0) text: Rachel, munching on a raw carrot, browses a row of family photographs. The sounds of dinner being prepared come from the kitchen. We see the history of the family in the pictures; Frank as a ten-year-old baseball player with a younger Herb; Herb as Police Chief of Bend, Oregon, being given a civic award; Frank as a college football wide receiver; Herb and Katherine Farmer, all dressed up and being introduced to Jimmy Carter by Frank; the picture-perfect family home in Oregon with Katherine tending flowers. Rachel notices a photo of a smiling Henry Kissinger, talking to some female reporters. There standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him, are Frank and Portman. Portman's also smiling at the women, flirting. Frank is in a familiar pose, alert, unsmiling, vigilant. Rachel looks at the two of them for a second. Frank steps from the kitchen with an orange juice and a drink for Rachel in his hand. He watches her for a moment as she studies the photo. She turns and sees him. They lock eyes for several seconds. She smiles as he hands her the drink.
136) 2) text: Portman sometimes had trouble remembering what his job was. Supper's ready. We can see from Rachel's face that she feels embarrassed about her behavior in Miami.

148) 0) text: Nicki's soft voice is joined by Rachel's strong harmony, and the two men watch as Rachel comes out to join her sister on the porch, startling Nicki. Both sing for a moment, together. Then Nicki stops, embarrassed. Rachel gives her a hug.
149) 3) text: Frank! I haven't... But Frank is already moving, leaping from the porch and starting to run flat out toward the boathouse and dock. Rachel turns to look. The skiff appears out of the boathouse, Fletcher at the motor, the boat's lone occupant. The boat moves slowly away from the boathouse, parallel to the dock. Frank is running toward the water with everything he's got, his face contorted. The sound of the OUTBOARD drowns out his voice as he yells.
149) 13) text: Fletcher, baby. Are you all right? Baby. Fletcher, spluttering, is handed up to Rachel by Frank. Rachel hugs Fletcher to her. Herb bends down to check he's breathing properly, wrapping the boy in his jacket. HERB

Behind the cars, the gates close on a large press contingent gathered outside, held back by a large number of police and security guards. A light drizzle is falling. The two cars pull up to the entrance, Henry at the wheel of Rachel's. Frank gets out of the front and opens the back door. Devaney and Spector help Rachel and Fletcher out of the car. They are all dressed in black. A few other mourners, including Emma, get out of the Mercedes. Rachel, red-eyed and weary, takes Fletcher under her arm and goes inside. She does not look at Frank.
180) 0) text: Frank begins climbing the stairs. When he has gone a quarter of the way up, Rachel appears at the top and begins walking down. At first she doesn't see Frank; when she does she hesitates a moment, then continues down. They meet and try to sidestep each other, but twice they go in the same direction, unable to get around. Rachel, already emotionally ravaged, cracks. She begins slapping Frank hard about the face and torso. One of the first blows knocks the GLASS from his hand; it SMASHES loudly against the wall. He raises his arms in a half-hearted attempt to protect himself from the onslaught. She cries as she hits him.
180) 1) dialog: (hysterical)
180) 4) dialog: She never hurt anyone. She was good. (she looks at him; entreats him)
180) 5) text: You saw her. She never wished anyone any harm. Did she? Did she? Frank looks at her, shakes his head "no." Rachel puts her head in her hands and is silent for a few moments; her crying slows.

181) 0) text: It's bright sunshine. Fletcher is splashing noisily in the pool with a few other kids. His nanny waits patiently at the side, towels at the ready. At one side of the pool, Rachel sits, lost in thought, mourning her sister. At the other side sits Frank, also thoughtful. He, too, is trying to adjust to the tragedy for which he bears some of the responsibility. The SHOUTS and LAUGHTER of the kids continue.

Perched on the top of a slight   hill, Frank sits alone a motionless under a big tree.    He gazes down at the gate house, his face lit softly by   the glow from its lamps. All around him the rest of the   estate is quiet and tranquil in the moonlight. After a moment, another silhouetted figure slowly ap- proaches and stands beside him. It's Rachel.
182) 1) dialog: I guess you've heard what's happening. Frank nods.
182) 2) dialog: Mind if I sit down? Frank shakes his head. They sit side by side for awhile, both lost in thought. Rachel seems very calm.

182) 5) dialog: So he'll come again?
