An old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back and forth over the freshly cut grass.  Throwing knives lay scattered nearby. A wooden post is  sticking out of the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard. BILL DEVANEY, fiftyish, a distinguished-looking black gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage Frank in a conversation that up to this point hasn't been going well He's Rachel's personal manager.
10) 1) dialog: So, you won't protect Rachel Marron just because she's in show business?
10) 3) dialog: But the biggest money's in show business people. Frank says nothing. His  eyes are  closed behind the sun- glasses. Devaney picks  up one of  the throwing knives. He holds it carefully by the blade  and throws it. It misses the post by three feet and  clatters against the fence. Frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his eyes again.

10) 10) text: You mean she doesn't collect dolls? DEVANEY (defeated)
10) 12) text: I thought I knew who she was. Devaney tries to size up whether Frank is kidding him or not. Frank's face betrays nothing. Devaney gestures with a knife. DEVANEY

10) 20) text: There's no such thing. DEVANEY
10) 23) text: All right. I'll come and I'll look the situation over. If I take it, it's three thousand a week. DEVANEY

10) 26) text: (mumbling) I know it's something like... The second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc and disappears into some bushes about three feet from Devaney. Devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind Frank. FRANK

17) 0) text: Frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is coming from. It is large and comfortable with plenty of seating, a bar, a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth. It is packed with people, props and video equipment. There is lots of activity, a general air of barely-organized chaos. MUSIC BLARES out. A group of six dancers, is rehearsing an energetic dance number for a music video, directed by their choreographer RORY. Sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the glass wall at the end of the room. A video cameraman circles them, taping the rehearsal, which appears on a large-screen TV behind them. In one corner, a pretty black girl is being pinned into a proposed costume for the video. Several people are stand- ing around, tending to the video and playback gear. All the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn't immediately apparent how many more people are hidden amon the big cushions. As Frank sits on the barstool at the back, a large swivel chair turns to reveal Devaney. He waves to Frank and makes his way over to him. On the other side of the room, a brawny, heavyset man in late thirties rises to look at Frank. He has a twenty inc neck. Devaney signals to him  that everything is all righ The brawny man looks at Frank a moment more, then sits do Frank looks around the room. A shelf laden with vitamins. Guitars of various makes. A flute. A gold record being used as a coaster. People smoking and chatting through the rehearsal.

17) 45) text: (one hand covers the phone) Nicki, I'm sure Mr. Farmer would tell you the number of nuts writing fan letters jumps every time Rachel is on the cover of a magazine. DEVANEY
17) 49) text: (overlapping Devaney) Oh. That was Clive's office. They called three times... DEVANEY
17) 50) text: Honey, that's not going to be a problem. DEVANEY (CONT'D)
17) 52) text: ...And I'm sure you'll blend in just fine. You can select whatever alarm systems you want for the house. Some kind of improved security for the gate. What else, Rachel? Rachel stands and starts to wander over to Rory and the dancers. Frank looks at Devaney.   Devaney doesn't like the tone this is taking. RACHEL
17) 56) text: I don't want him to think   he's in prison. So the house and    grounds must not be altered in any   way. He shouldn't be aware that   you're here. Is that clear? Frank looks at her a long time, glancing up at Devaney once. FRANK
17) 60) text: You can go past the pool. DEVANEY
17) 62) text: Nice meeting you. DEVANEY
17) 64) text: Bill, I don't think we should be begging this guy for his services. DEVANEY

18) 1) dialog: Farmer, will you wait a minute? I should have told you more. I'm sorry but I was afraid she wouldn't go through with it. I thought I'd let the two of you work it out... come to an understanding.
18) 3) dialog: She's not a bad person, and whether she knows it or not, she needs you. (a beat)
18) 4) text: You've come this far... Would you just wait here for one minute. I want to show you something. Please, Farmer. Devaney runs back to the house.
19) 24) dialog: How are you, Fletch? (to Frank)
20) 0) text: Devaney slides the file across the table at Frank, open- ing it. Inside are letters of every size and condition. Repeatedly throughout this scene Frank's gaze is drawn to Fletcher, who has started his boat again.
20) 1) dialog: This is just in the last six months.
20) 3) text: Have you ever tried having these professionally assessed? Devaney shakes his head no. Frank begins to look through the letters, flipping them b the corner of the page. From many different sources, some are scrawled, some typed, some assembled from cutouts. Many are soiled and torn, others immaculate. Occasionally one will have a photo of Rachel with crude markings on it Spector enters sucking on a popsicle. He comes to stand over Frank's shoulder, peering nonchalantly at the piles of letters.
20) 13) text: This could be something. Devaney searches Frank's face. DEVANEY
20) 22) dialog: Sy, I think we should show him the room.
21) 0) text: Frank follows Spector and Devaney into the room. He glances around, taking in the murals, the decor, the kitsch attempt at fornicatorial splendour right from the pages of a tabloid layout.

21) 13) text: Are you kidding? This would really freak her out. DEVANEY
21) 15) text: Someone penetrates the house, gets upstairs and jerks off on the bed ... I'd say that qualifies as a problem. DEVANEY

Frank, Henry and Fletcher watch in the newly-erected guard house. The area is greatly changed. There is a uniformed guard with an impressive array of switches, lights and phones at his command.

46) 9) text: He's through messing with my life. DEVANEY
46) 10) text: Rachel, I'm getting goddamn sick of running up here every time he steps on your toes. (leaning out the glass door) Farmer! Would you come in here a minute? Devaney walks back toward Rachel. RACHEL
46) 16) text: Did he have an appointment? Devaney turns to him. DEVANEY
46) 20) text: (mimicking him) 'I don't want her doing anything she's always done.' The guy's a fanatic. DEVANEY
46) 26) text: Maybe he gets off listening to my calls. All that heavy breathing... DEVANEY

60) 1) dialog: Excuse me... hello... I've got an announcement to make. I'm sorry but... due to circumstances beyond... Voices shout. "Where's Rachel?"... a groan begins. A chorus of boos fills the room. He raises his hands.
62) 1) dialog: I'm afraid that... A great gush of applause from the audience. Devaney's befuddled. He doesn't see Rachel walking up behind him.
62) 2) dialog: Rachel won't be able... Rachel stands beside him beaming. She bows. Claps back to her fans. Devaney retreats. Rachel gestures in his direction.
90) 4) text: What's on my mind is that you're fired, Frank. She missed all her interviews yesterday because of your little date. Do you realize she stood up Barbara Walters?

A roadie has her luggage removed from the limo and loaded aboard the plane. Devaney is trying to hurry her on board. Spector is conspicuous by his absence. As Rachel and the others prepare to get onto the plane, Tony, wearing a dark leather eyepatch, reacts to something O.S. Frank approaches from the nearby parking area. He is pale.
