But this is no longer twelve-year-old Elizabeth standing the stern of the Dauntless; this is twenty-year-old Elizabeth, lying in bed in the dark. She remains motionless (were the images we just saw a nightmare, or a jumbled childhood memory?) Elizabeth slowly looks as far out the corner of her eyes possible without moving. Might there be someone in the room with her, looming over her? She turns, ready for anything.   She is alone. Elizabeth sits up, turns up the flame on an oil lamp besides the canopied bed. She carries the lamp across the room to a dressing table, sits down. She pulls one of the small drawers all the way out, reach into a space beneath it and removes -- The MEDALLION. She has kept it all this time. It has not lost its luster -- or its sense of menace.

Norrington draws the sword, flourishes the sword, and snaps the blade up in front of his face. Swann steps forward, pins a medal to Norrington's jacket, steps back. Norrington nods, turns smartly and nods to his fellow officers, turns again and nods to the audience - dignitaries, merchants, plantation owners, their families Another flourish, and he returns the sword to its scabbar The silence is broken by loud APPLAUSE. Backslapping from the Navy men. In the audience, Elizabeth doesn't look so good, out beneath the hot sun. She applauds briefly, then winces.
