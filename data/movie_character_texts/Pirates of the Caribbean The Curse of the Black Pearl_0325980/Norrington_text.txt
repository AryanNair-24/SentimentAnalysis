2) 9) dialog: Think again, Miss Swan.   Vile and dissolute creatures, the  lot of them. I intend to see to   it that any man who sails under a  pirate flag, or wears a pirates  brand, gets what he deserves: a  short drop and a sudden stop. Elizabeth doesn't know what 'a short drop and a sudden stop' means. Gibbs helpfully mimes: a man being hung.

10) 3) dialog: I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.
10) 4) dialog: (working up his confidence to do so) This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career. But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved. The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman. (beat) You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
10) 6) dialog: (smiles) I'm a bit nervous, myself -- Elizabeth loses her balance, stumbles away from Norringto She reaches a hand out to the parapet to steady herself, but it slides off - -- and then she vanishes over the wall. Gone.

15) 18) dialog: It doesn't bear true. Jack looks away, a bit embarrassed. Norrington returns th compass to the belt. Draws the sword half from the scabbard.

15) 20) dialog: Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship. You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
