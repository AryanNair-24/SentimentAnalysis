It's a small room, twin-beds, more wicker, adjoining  bathroom.  Outside the French windows is a balcony, givin on the ocean. As Joe comes in, a BELLHOP is just setting down some  suitcases - two of them are Joe's and Jerry's, the third somewhat more elegant model in brown cloth with a white  stripe down the middle and the initials B.B.  The Bellhop fresh punk of seventeen, turns to Joe. BELLHOP Are these your bags? JOE Yes.  And that one, too. BELLHOP Okay, doll. JOE I suppose you want a tip?
12) 5) dialog: Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization. JOE Bye. BELLHOP (the young Clark Gable) Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight? JOE Why? BELLHOP Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull - JOE Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Spats Colombo entering  the lobby, surrounded by his four henchmen and followed  by bellhops carrying their luggage.  The henchmen are all dolled up for Florida - knickers, Panamas, two-toned shoe - and one of them is carrying a golf bag. Spats is somewhat more conservatively dressed in a light  gray business suit.  They stop and look around. Draped across the rear wall is an impressive banner  reading:
30) 19) text: With as much grace as they can muster, they hurry back  toward the elevator.  The doors are just opening, and our Bellhops comes backing out, trundling an old man in a  wheelchair.  The old man wears a Panama hat, dark  glasses, and is covered up to his chin with a plaid blank Joe and Jerry almost fall over the invalid in their haste get to the elevator. 67.        INT.  ELEVATOR - (CONTINUOUS) - DAY. Joe and Jerry scramble inside. JOE Going up.
36) 17) text: He opens the door to the corridor and they peer out. 85.        INT.  THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY. There is no sign of Spats and his boys.  The elevator doo just opening, and the Bellhop emerges, pushing the old ma in the wheelchair.  Joe and Jerry watch as the Bellhop  wheels the old man into one of the rooms.  They look at  each other, as the same idea occurs to them both, nod the heads in agreement.  Slipping out of Spats' room, they cr the corridor to the old man's room, start inside.
37) 0) text: The elevator doors open, and a Bellhop backs out with a  man in a wheel chair.  As they turn INTO CAMERA, we  discover that the bellhop is Jerry - the uniform fitting much too snugly - and the blanket-covered figure in the  wheel chair is Joe, dressed in the old man's suit, Panama hat, and dark glasses. As Jerry and Joe proceed with dignity toward the front  door, we see Spats and his henchmen deployed in strategic positions around the lobby.  Jerry wheels Joe past Spats. Spats glances at them casually, then becomes aware of a  strange CLACKING SOUND.  He looks down. There is something decidedly odd about the bellhop -  because his trouser-legs terminate in high-heeled shoes. Spats, grinning smugly, signals the two henchmen who are  guarding the front door.  They start to close in on Joe a Jerry.  Jerry abruptly spins the wheel chair around, trun it toward the rear of the lobby.  The other to henchmen  take up the chase.  Jerry and Joe disappear into a corrid leading toward the rear of the hotel.  As the pursuing  henchmen start to turn into the corridor, the empty wheel chair comes whizzing toward them.  The henchmen stumble  over it, become momentarily entangled. Joe and Jerry, sprinting down the corridor, reach an open door, dart inside.  The henchmen come racing up, and  passing the door, round a bend in the corridor. 87.        INT.  PANTRY - DAY. In the center of the room stands a huge cake, and two  convention officials are decorating it under the watchful of Johnny Paradise, who leans against the wall  monotonously tossing a coin into the air.  One of the  officials, wielding a confectioner's cone, has almost fin lettering the inscription HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SPATS. Joe and Jerry burst in from the corridor, and the three  hoods look up, startled. Before they can recover, the boy have scooted across the room and out another door. 88.        INT.  BANQUET ROOM - DAY. Joe and Jerry come dashing in breathlessly, stop to get t bearings.  Dominating the room is a U-shaped table,  covered with flowers and about thirty place-settings, wit half grapefruit on each plate.  On the wall behind the he of the table is the banner welcoming the Friends of Itali Opera.  The boys glance around the empty room, make a  beeline for the main entrance.  As they reach the door, i starts to open, and voices are HEARD from the corridor.   They turn desperately toward a second door, but that too opening.  Trapped, they duck under the banquet table,  disappearing behind the long white tablecloth just as the banqueteers start to troop in.  They are the same mugs we saw in the lobby, but they are now dressed in tuxedos or  white dinner jackets.  Chatting amiably, they move to the places at the table. Under the table, Joe and Jerry huddle together as the  delegates start to seat themselves.  Suddenly a pair of l slide beneath the tablecloth directly in front of them - the boys recoil when they see that the owner's shoes are  encased in spats. Spats Colombo is settling himself at the table, while his henchmen take the seats on either side of him. SPATS What happened? FIRST HENCHMAN Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle. SPATS (turning to other two henchmen) Where were you guys? SECOND HENCHMAN Us?  We was with you at Rigoletto's.

Almost despite  himself, Joe finds himself drawn toward the ballroom  entrance. 92.        INT.  BALLROOM - NIGHT. Joe appears in the vestibule at the top of the stairs, lo down. From his point of view, we see Sugar perched on top of th piano, bathed in a spotlight.  She is a little drunk, and than a little blue, and she is singing the lyrics with  heartbreaking conviction. Joe, watching her from the landing, is deeply moved.   Slowly, he starts down the steps. One the bandstand, Sugar is winding up the torchy ballad, when suddenly Joe steps into the spotlight.  Without a wo he takes her in his arms, kisses her. SUGAR (shocked) Josephine!!
