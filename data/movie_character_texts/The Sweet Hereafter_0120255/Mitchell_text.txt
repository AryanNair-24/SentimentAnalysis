40) 23) text: So you're just the thing we need. MITCHELL
40) 25) text: Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best? MITCHELL
40) 26) text: Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best. As we're sitting here the town or the school board or the manufacturer of that bus are lining up a battery of their own lawyers to negotiate with people as grief-stricken as yourselves.  And this makes me very, very mad.  It's why I came all the way up here.  If everyone had done their job with integrity your son would be alive this morning and safely in school.  I promise you that I will pursue and reveal who it was that did not do their job. MITCHELL
40) 29) text: MITCHELL nods sympathetically. MITCHELL
40) 31) text: What we're talking about is an ongoing relationship to time. Pause.  HARTLEY looks at MITCHELL'S teacup. HARTLEY

Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was. ALISON stares at MITCHELL, taken by his need to chronicle and detail this irrelevant stranger.

77) 22) text: And they won't understand until you let me clear your name - your good name - once and for all.  Will you let me do that?  Will you let me do my duty? Suddenly, ABBOTT says something.  He twists his face arou his mouth, purses his lips on the left side and emits a string of broken syllables and sounds.  After this outbur DOLORES looks at MITCHELL, a comforted smile on her face.

We're trying to generate some compensation, however meager, for what you have suffered, and at the same time see that an accident like this never happens again.  You're central to the case I'm trying to build, Nicole.  But you'd probably just as soon let the whole thing lie.  Just get on with your life as quickly and smoothly as possible. NICOLE nods.
