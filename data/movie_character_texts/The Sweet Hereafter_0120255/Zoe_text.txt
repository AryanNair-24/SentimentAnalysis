4) 0) text: The phone booth is located in a rundown area of a large city.  A young woman, ZOE, enters the booth and lifts the receiver.
6) 1) text: ZOE is on the phone.  There's a figure outside the booth waiting for her.
6) 2) dialog: Daddy, it's me...How are you doing? That's great...Where are you? What's that sound?
8) 1) dialog: A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
9) 1) dialog: (over the phone)
9) 3) text: Why are you calling me, Zoe?
10) 0) text: ZOE
11) 1) text: Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe. ZOE (over the phone)
11) 3) text: The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now. ZOE (over the phone)
12) 0) text: ZOE
13) 0) text: MITCHELL is emotionally stunned by ZOE'S voice.  She is heard over the phone. ZOE (over the phone)
13) 1) text: Daddy!  Are you listening to me, Daddy?! The music that MITCHELL has been listening to becomes lou as he stares at the spinning felt wheels of the car wash. ZOE (CONT'D)
13) 4) text: ZOE
14) 0) text: The phone booth is deserted.  ZOE is nowhere to be seen. Over this image, the sounds of a band playing a blues number.
25) 1) text: Zoe...Zoe, where are you?
26) 6) text: I was a friend of Zoe's.  We went to school together.  I used to come to your house. MITCHELL (pretending to remember)
26) 20) text: And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
37) 1) text: I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay. MITCHELL
41) 1) text: A photograph of ZOE. MITCHELL stares at this photograph. MITCHELL (voice over)
67) 1) text: Every time I get on one of these flights to rescue Zoe, I remember the summer we almost lost her.  She was three years old.  It happened in the morning, at this cottage we used to rent.  We were all sleeping together in bed.  It was a wonderful time in our lives.  We still thought we had a future together, the three of us.  Did you ever visit the cottage?
68) 3) text: I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face. ALISON
68) 5) text: I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was. ALISON stares at MITCHELL, taken by his need to chronicle and detail this irrelevant stranger.
69) 0) text: FATHER (YOUNG MITCHELL) is on the phone.  The camera is behind his head. In front of him, MOTHER (KLARA) is breast-feeding the THR YEAR OLD GIRL (ZOE). MITCHELL (voice over)
69) 1) text: He surmised that there was a nest of baby black widow spiders in the mattress.  He told me they had to be babies, or else with Zoe's body
70) 1) text: Which was true enough, especially at that moment.  Klara was wild-eyed with fear, and her fear was contagious.  I was a better actor than she was, that's all.  Zoe loved us equally then.  Just like she hates us both equally now. (beat)
71) 2) text: The other part was a surgeon, ready to cut into her throat.  I waited for the second that Zoe's breath stopped to make that incision.
87) 2) text: Yes, I'll accept the charges. ZOE
88) 1) text: Yes. ZOE
88) 3) text: News? ZOE
88) 5) text: Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe. ZOE
88) 7) text: Tell me your news, Zoe. ZOE
88) 9) text: That's not news, Zoe. ZOE
89) 0) text: Image of ZOE as a little girl in MITCHELL'S lap.  Her fac is swollen.  She is being driven to the hospital. MITCHELL is singing her a lullaby. MiTCHELL's conversation with ZOE continues over this imag ZOE
89) 2) text: Yes. ZOE
89) 4) text: Yes. ZOE
89) 6) text: What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want. ZOE
89) 8) text: What for? ZOE
89) 10) text: Do you have the blood test? ZOE
89) 13) text: test.  In case the one you got...was wrong. ZOE
89) 14) text: I like it when you don't believe me, Daddy.  It's better you don't believe me but have to act like you do. Pause. ZOE (CONT'D)
89) 16) text: Yes.  I can hear you breathing too. ZOE begins to cry over the phone. ZOE
89) 18) text: I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
114) 5) text: Say hi to Zoe. MITCHELL
