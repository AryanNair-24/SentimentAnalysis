24) 0) text: Barbara hands the Protagonist a cup of tea.
24) 1) dialog: No small talk, nothing that might reveal who we are, or what we do.
24) 3) dialog: You’re not here for ‘what’, you’re here for ‘how’. ‘What’ is your department. And not my business.
24) 5) dialog: As I understand it, we’re trying to prevent World War Three.
24) 7) dialog: No. Something worse.
25) 0) text: Barbara hands the Protagonist a semi-automatic. He reflexively checks the chamber and magazine - EMPTY.
25) 1) dialog: Aim it and pull the trigger. The Protagonist SHRUGS, lifts the empty pistol, sights a target 25m away with several holes in it... He squeezes the trigger - BAM! - a shot. He is CONFUSED..
25) 2) dialog: Check the magazine. The Protagonist checks the clip - THERE IS A ROUND IN IT.
25) 4) dialog: One of these bullets is, like us, travelling forwards through time. The other one’s going backwards. Can you tell which is which? The Protagonist shakes his head. Barbara reaches forward
25) 5) dialog: How about now? - 13. One of the rounds FLIES UP INTO HER HAND, FALLING IN REVE The Protagonist is taken aback. Barbara holds the round towards him so he can inspect it -
25) 6) dialog: It's inverted - its entropy runs backwards. So, to our eyes, its movement is reversed. We think it’s a type of inverse radiation, triggered by nuclear fission.
25) 8) dialog: We don’t know how. Yet.
25) 10) dialog: Someone’s manufacturing them in the future. They’re streaming back at us. Barbara places the round on the table, in front of a CAME
25) 11) dialog: Try it. He puts on a glove - moves his hand over it, nothing.
25) 12) dialog: You have to have dropped it. The Protagonist reaches out again - it LEAPS UP INTO HIS HAND.
25) 14) dialog: From your point of view you caught it, but from the bullet’s point of view... She plays it BACKWARDS -—
25) 15) dialog: ..-you dropped it. ON THE SCREEN: the round FALLS from his hand.
25) 17) dialog: No. That’s just how we see time. She PULLS the round towards herself using one finger - th round follows her finger as if MAGNETIZED...
25) 19) dialog: That bullet wouldn't have moved if you hadn’t put your hand there. Either way we run the tape, you made it happen. She LAUNCHES it up into her other hand -
25) 20) dialog: Don’t try to understand it. Feel it. Barbara PLAYS with the round in increasingly IMPROBABLE, BEAUTIFUL MOVEMENTS... The round SHOOTS AWAY FROM HER - t Protagonist CATCHES IT...
25) 23) dialog: You’re not shooting the bullet, you’re catching it.
25) 26) dialog: In the field?
25) 28) dialog: Then you are exceedingly lucky... The Protagonist turns to her...
25) 29) dialog: An inverted bullet passing through your body would be devastating. The inverse radiation would spread through your body. Like polonium poisoning. Not pretty. The Protagonist examines the rounds...
25) 31) dialog: They may have been made today, then inverted years from now.
25) 33) dialog: They came with the wall. I was assigned it, like all the material I’m studying here.
25) 35) dialog: Sure. Why?
25) 37) dialog: Let’s not go off-topic.
26) 1) dialog: A bullet may not seem like much, but it’s a simple machine - lead bullet, brass casing, gunpowder. If they can invert this - I see no reason they couldn’t invert pretty much anything. Even a nuclear weapon can only affect our future. An inverted weapon might be able to affect our past as well. Barbara stops at a drawer. Gestures around herself -
26) 2) dialog: Now that we know what to look for, we're finding more and more inverted material... She opens a drawer, revealing a VARIETY OF RUSTED BITS AN PIECES - SCREWS, CRACKED LENSES, METAL RODS, BUTTONS...
26) 3) dialog: ...remnants of complex objects. The Protagonist reaches out and lets a RUSTED BUCKLE leap into his hand.
26) 5) dialog: The detritus of a coming war. The Protagonist looks around at the MULTITUDE of DRAWERS.
