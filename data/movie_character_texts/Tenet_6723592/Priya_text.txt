36) 14) dialog: I’m Priya Singh.
36) 16) dialog: A masculine front in a man’s world has its uses. The dealer you're looking for is Andrei Sator.
36) 18) dialog: You know him?
36) 20) dialog: Very good. Except the ‘gas’ he made his billions from was actually plutonium, and he’s said to be on the outs so he can feed British Intelligence whatever the Russians want them to think they know. 22.
36) 22) dialog: When I sold him the rounds, they were perfectly ordinary.
36) 24) dialog: We believe he’s functioning as some kind of broker between our time and the future.
36) 26) dialog: We all do. Credit cards, email, text - anything that goes into the record speaks directly to the future. The question is - can the future speak back? And, if so, what are they saying?
36) 28) dialog: To get anywhere near Sator would take a fresh-faced protagonist... She reaches up to touch his cheek.
36) 29) dialog: Fresh as a daisy. Get close, find out what he’s receiving and how.
36) 31) dialog: I have a contact who’s out of Sator’s reach.
36) 33) dialog: No, he thinks we’re chasing plutonium. SIRENS. BANGS! Priya looks over to see POLICE CARS arrivi far below, in the WALLED YARD at the foot of her house... 23.
36) 34) dialog: You'd better get out of here.
36) 36) dialog: You have to start looking at the world in a new way - this conflict runs backwards and forwards simultaneously. Your name on a police report reveals your identity to the future - they pass it back to Sator -—
36) 38) dialog: You got in - you must've had a plan for getting out. The Protagonist pulls a CLIP and cord from his harness -
100) 0) text: The Protagonist boards, approaching Priya at the rail.
100) 1) dialog: I don’t like to leave my house.
100) 3) dialog: What about?
100) 5) dialog: We spoke about it -
100) 7) dialog: We're trying to do with inversion what we couldn’t do with the atomic bomb - uninvent it. Divide and contain the knowledge. Ignorance is our ammunition - the more any one of us knows, the greater the risk that we’re actually making the situation worse. 51.
100) 9) dialog: Your work? The Protagonist nods.
100) 10) dialog: What did you find in the vaults?
100) 12) dialog: Both emerged at the same moment?
100) 14) dialog: They were the same person. You saw someone re-inverting. Sator’s built a turnstile in that vault.
100) 16) dialog: A machine for inverting.
100) 18) dialog: It hasn’t. He’s been given it by the future.
100) 20) dialog: You've the best chance of finding out.
101) 1) dialog: Have you met him? 52.
101) 3) dialog: Get closer.
101) 5) dialog: The wife set you up?
101) 7) dialog: This was always a suicide mission - that’s why they recruited a corpse.
101) 9) dialog: Everyone. Survival. You need more, consider yourself working for me.
101) 11) dialog: What if you have something he needs?
101) 13) dialog: Plutonium 241. Sator tried to lift the only loose 241 from under a CIA team at the opera siege in Kiev. He got the team, but not the 241.
101) 15) dialog: Ukrainian security services. It’s moving through Tallinn in a week. 53.
101) 17) dialog: No. Sator has to stay alive until we know his part in things. Leverage the situation without losing control of the 241.
101) 19) dialog: A terrorist bomb, even one that kills millions, is nothing compared with what happens if we don’t stop Sator.
101) 21) dialog: We're being attacked. Not by terrorists or rogue states...
101) 23) dialog: We're being attacked by the future. And we're fighting over time.
101) 25) dialog: Theirs is running out, so they’re coming for ours. And Sator is helping. You have to find out how.
166) 0) text: The Protagonist makes his way through the crowd, followin elegantly dressed lady... Priya. He takes her by the arm, away from the crowd...
166) 2) dialog: What’s going on? Where’s Neil?
166) 4) dialog: What did I do?
166) 6) dialog: You let him get hold of 241?
166) 9) dialog: It’s unique. The scientist who built it took her own life so she couldn't be forced to make another.
166) 11) dialog: Generations from now.
166) 13) dialog: You're familiar with the Manhattan Project? As they approached the first atomic test, Oppenheimer became concerned the detonation might produce a chain reaction, engulfing the world.
166) 15) dialog: Think of our scientist as her generation’s Oppenheimer - she devises a method for inverting the world, but becomes convinced that by destroying us, they destroy themselves.
166) 17) dialog: Unlike Oppenheimer, she rebels, splitting the algorithm into nine sections and hiding them the best place she can think of...
166) 19) dialog: There are nine nuclear powers. Nine bombs. Nine sets of the most closely guarded materials in the history of the world. The best hiding places possible.
166) 21) dialog: Sator’s lifelong mission, financed and guided by the future, has been to find and reassemble the algorithm.
166) 23) dialog: The necessary combination of greed and ambition. But mostly, he was in the right place at the right time.
166) 25) dialog: The most insecure moment in the history of nuclear weapons.
166) 27) dialog: After the 241? All nine.
166) 29) dialog: To change things? So Katherine won’t get hurt?
166) 31) dialog: If that universe can exist, we don’t live in it.
166) 33) dialog: No. I’m not. Ignorance is our ammunition. If you’d known what the algorithm was, would you have let it fall into Sator’s hands?
166) 35) dialog: It’s the only way he'll bring together the other eight.
166) 37) dialog: (smiles) Mission accomplished.
166) 39) dialog: As you used Katherine. Standard operating procedure. You’ve done your part.
166) 41) dialog: You're a protagonist. (off look) What? You thought you were the only person capable of saving the world?
166) 43) dialog: You’re about to.
166) 45) dialog: Why would you involve her again?
166) 47) dialog: Does he still trust her?
166) 49) dialog: You have started looking at the world in a new way.
166) 51) dialog: I can’t.
166) 53) dialog: (frustrated) What good is someone’s word in our line of business? The Protagonist just looks at her. She NODS.
166) 54) dialog: They'll be safe. There’s a rally point offshore at Trondheim. Get yourselves up there...
167) 1) dialog: Ives has a team ready to invert. CUT BACK TO THE PROTAGONIST IN OSLO -— 113.
168) 1) dialog: Fighting fire with fire is a treacherous business, but there are people in the future who need us to continue the algorithm’s journey into the past. You see... Taking a look at the sea CHURNING BACKWARDS into the ster the inverted ship ‘progresses’, he heads below deck...
168) 3) dialog: ...Tenet wasn’t founded in the past - it will be founded in the future.
225) 0) text: Priya is in the front passenger seat. The DRIVER next to has a GUN and SILENCER sitting on his knee...
225) 1) dialog: Do it before the boy comes out. The rear door opens - a dull thud - the Driver is SHOT by silenced pistol -
225) 4) dialog: And I told you what it would be worth. Here. Today. How did you know? He holds up a dumb phone, plays a voicemail -
227) 2) dialog: I have to tie up the loose ends. 147.
227) 4) dialog: Then whose was it? The Protagonist brings his focus back to Priya.
227) 6) dialog: Then you’d better tie up those loose ends. He shoots her through the seat back. She slumps forward.
