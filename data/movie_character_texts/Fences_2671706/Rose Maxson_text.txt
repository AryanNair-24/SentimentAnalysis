Woman wears some big stockings. Got them great big old legs and hips as wide as the Mississippi river. troy: Legs don’t mean nothing. You don’t do nothing but push them out of the way. But them hips cush- ion the ride! Bono: Troy, you ain’t got no sense. troy: It’s the truth! Like you riding on Goodyears!

Materials for a new fence. ..a couple of wooden sawhorses waiting for the lumber stacked under a tarp. One or two chairs of dubious value sit at one end where the kitchen window opens onto the porch. An old-fashioned ice box stands silent guard at the other end. Rose maxson comes out onto the porch, holding a bowl of snap peas. She is ten years younger than troy. Her devotion to him stems from the recognition of the possibilities of her life without him: a succession of abusive men and their babies, a life of partying and running the streets, the church, or aloneness with its attendant pain and frustration. She recognizes troy’s spirit as a fine and illuminating one and she either ignores or forgives his faults, only some of which she recognizes. Though she doesn’t drink, her presence is an integral part of the friday night rituals. 9780735217867 Fences.indd 8 11/1516 1:50 PM

When I met this woman I got out that place, say, “Hitch up my pony, saddle up my mare . . . there’s a woman out there for me somewhere. I looked here. Looked there. Saw Rose and latched on to her.” I latched on to her and told her-I’m gonna tell you the truth-I told her, “Baby, I don’t wanna marry, I just wanna be your man.” Rose told me . . . tell him what you told me, Rose. 9780735217867 Fences.indd 9 11/1516 1:50 PM

I’m talking about what she charge. She charge ten cents more than the A&P. troy: The A&P ain’t never done nothing for me. I spends my money where I’m treated right. I go down to Bella, say, “I need a loaf of bread, I’11 pay you Friday.” She give it to me. What sense that make when I got money to go and spend it somewhere else and ignore the person who done right by me? That ain’t in the Bible. ROsE: We ain’t talking about what’s in the Bible.

Bono’s gonna die. Hell, we all gonna die. ROSE: But you ain’t got to talk about it. I don’t like to talk about it. troy: You the one brought it up. Me and Bono was talking about baseball... you tell me I’m gonna drink myself to death. Ain’t that right, Bono? You know I don’t drink this but one night out of the week. That’s Friday night. I’m gonna drink just enough to where I can handle it. Then I cuts it loose. I leave it alone. So don’t you worry about me drinking myself to death. ’Cause I ain’t worried about Death.

I wrestled with Death for three days and three nights and I’m standing here to tell you about it... All right. At the end of the third night we done weakened each other to where we can’t hardly move. Death stood up, throwed on his robe . . . had him a white robe with a hood on it. Troy mimics a Klansman’s hood. Bono laughs at this; Rose does the same in spite of herself. troy: He throwed on that robe and went off to look for his sickle. Say, “I'll be back.” Just like that. “I’11 be back.” I told him say, “Yeah, but you gonna have to find me!” I wasn’t no fool. I wasn’t going looking for him. Death ain’t nothing to play with.

She finds the ball game on the radio. She gets a metal cooking sheet, returns to the table, wipes her hands and starts lumping batter onto the sheet. Soon her fingers are covered with batter.

You and them and this child is all I got in the world. So I guess what I’m saying is . . . I’d appreciate it if you’d help me take care of her. Rose: Okay, Troy . . . you’re right. I'll take care of your baby for you... ‘cause . . . like you say... she’s innocent... and you can’t visit the sins of the father upon the child. A motherless child has got a hard time.

It don’t matter what time I come back. troy: I just asked you a question, woman. What’s the matter . . . can’t I ask you a question? Rose: Troy, I don’t want to go into it. She steps out onto the front porch. He starts to follow, but she stops in the doorway. She puts the cake down on one of the porch chairs, turns to him: Rose: Your dinner’s in there on the stove. All you got to do is heat it up. And don’t you be eating the rest of them cakes in there. I’m coming back for 116 9780735217867 Fences.indd 116 11/1516 1:50 PM

He stands alone in the empty house, unsure of what to do. He flaps the money he’s holding. He goes to the dining room table and puts his cash next to Lyons’ twenty. He pockets the twenty and starts for the door. INT. TAYLORS’ BAR—LATE AFTERNOON Troy sits alone at the bar, a generous glass of gin before him. He takes a sip. Someone pulls out the stool next to him and starts to sit. Troy looks. It’s Bono. Bono: Hey, Troy. troy: Hey, what’s happening, Bono? Bono: I just thought I’d stop by to see you. Wasn’t no one at the house, so I figured - troy: What you stop by and see me for? You ain’t stopped by the house in a month of Sundays. Hell, I must owe you money or something.

It ain’t like working the back of the truck. Ain’t got nobody to talk to... feel like you working by yourself. Naw, I’m thinking about retiring. Bono nods. An awkward silence. troy: How’s Lucille? pono: She all right. Her arthritis get to acting up on her sometime. Saw Rose on my way here.

He wasn’t satisfied hitting in the seats . . . he wanted to hit it over every- thing! After the game he had two hundred people standing around waiting to shake his hand.

He walks toward it as he hears ROSE (AS SHE COMES DOWN BACK STEPS): Ain’t too much chang He still got that piece of rag tied to that tree. He was out here swinging that bat. I was just ready to go back in the house. He swung that bat and then he just fell over. Seem like he swung it and stood there with this grin on his face . . . and then he just fell over. They car- ried him on down to the hospital but I knew there wasn’t no need . . . why don’t you come on in the house. cory: Mama . . . I got something to tell you.

You standing there all healthy and grown talking about you ain’t going to your daddy’s funeral? cory: Mama . . . listen Rose: I don’t want to hear it, Cory. You just get that thought out of your head. cory: I’ve got to say no to him. One time in my life I’ve got to say no. RoszE: Don’t nobody have to listen to nothing like that. I know you and your daddy ain’t seen eye to eye, but I ain’t gotta listen to that kind of talk this morning. Disrespecting your daddy ain't gonna make you a man, Cory. You got to find a way to come to that on your own. Not going to your daddy’s funeral ain’t gonna make you a man. Cory looks around, trying to find what to say. Then: cory: The whole time I was growing up . . . living in his house . . . Papa was like a shadow that fol- lowed you everywhere. It weighed on you and sunk into your flesh. It would wrap around you and lay there until you couldn’t tell which one was you anymore. That shadow digging in your flesh. Trying to crawl in. Trying to live through you. I’m just 136 9780735217867 Fences.indd 136 11/1516 1:50 PM

ROSE: You Troy Maxson all over again. cory: I don’t want to be Troy Maxson. I want to be me. Rose: You can’t be nobody but who you are, Cory. That shadow wasn’t nothing but you growing into your- self. You either got to grow into it or cut it down to fit you. But that’s all you got to make life with. That’s all you got to measure yourself against that world out there. Your daddy wanted you to be everything he wasn’t . . . and at the same time he tried to make you into everything he was. I don’t know if he was right or wrong but I do know he meant to do more good than he meant to do harm. She stops, overwhelmed. Cory puts his hand on her hand. She takes his hand, squeezes it, turns it over, holding on. ROSE: Sometimes when he touched he bruised. And some- times when he took me in his arms he cut. (beat) When I first met your daddy I thought, “Here is aman I can lay down with and make a baby.” That’s the first thing I thought when I seen him “Rose Lee, here is a man that you can open your- 137 9780735217867 Fences.indd 137 11/1516 1:50 PM

Cory gets up, crosses over to the tree. Rose stands at the screen door watching him. She takes a look at the threat- ening sky, about to return to the house, when she sees Gabriel. He’s older but healthier, more vi- tal, in a new suit and a hat. One arm is behind his back. Rose is speechless with surprise. GABRIEL: Hey, Rose! ROSE: Gabe? GaBRIEL: I’m here, Rose.

He takes his hand from behind him and holds his trumpet aloft. GABRIEL: Hey, Rose. It’s time. It’s time to tell Saint Peter to open the Gates. Not knowing what she’s agreeing to, Rose nods. GABRIEL: Troy, you ready? Gabriel waits for an answer. Raynell comes out on the porch and hides behind Rose, shy. Gabe smiles at her, and she returns his smile. GABRIEL: You ready, Troy. I’m gonna tell Saint Peter to open the Gates. You get ready now. Gabriel puts the trumpet to his lips, two decades of waiting for this moment 141 9780735217867_Fences.indd 141 11/1516 1:50 PM
