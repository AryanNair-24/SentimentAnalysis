Ain’t nobody else got nothing to do with this. We see the closed door behind Troy. Then we’re on the other side of the door, on the landing. Rose is leaning hard against the door, hand on the knob, wanting to go in but knowing she mustn’t. Troy’s voice is loud even through the door. mroy (0.8.): This is between you and me. Cory comes out of his room. He walks to his mother as Troy shouts: mroy (o.s.): Man to man.

Troy waits again; no response. He draws himself back into the room, closes the window. He opens the bedroom door. Rose and Cory are there. No one knows what to say. Troy passes his wife and son. They hear him descending the stairs, then the front door opens and slams shut. 110 9780735217867 Fences.indd 110 11/1516 1:50 PM

The moment Cory sees Troy, he stops. Troy looks ready to say something. Cory tosses the bat away, carelessly. Making a show of it he buttons his collar, clips the tie into place, and walks out the right side alley, all without giving his father a glance. Troy goes to the bat, picks it up and puts it into its proper place against the tree. He turns and heads into the house.

That’s what you need. You got that, huh? cory: You don’t know what I got. You ain’t got to worry about what I got. troy: You right! You one hundred percent right!

All you ever did was try and make me scared of you. I used to tremble every time you called my name. Every time I heard your foot- steps in the house. Wondering all the time what’s Papa gonna say if I do this? . . . What's he gonna say if I do that? . . . What’s Papa gonna say if I turn on the radio?

Troy advances toward Cory. cory: What you gonna do . . . give me a whupping? You can’t whup me no more. You're too old. You just an old man. Troy grabs Cory’s shirt and pulls Cory to him. mror: Nigger! That’s what you are! You just another nigger on the street to me! Troy throws Cory backward in the dirt. cory: You crazy!

You took Uncle Gabe’s money he got from the Army to buy this house and then you put him out. troy: Get your black ass out of my yard! Troy’s advance backs Cory up against the tree. Cory grabs up the bat. cory: I ain’t going nowhere! Come on . . . put me out! I ain’t scared of you. troy: That’s my bat! cory: Come on!

Troy starts toward the tree with the bat, staggering, sick exhausted, his mouth horribly dry. He tries to moisten it with this tongue: no use. troy: I can’t taste nothing. Hallelujah! I can’t taste nothing no more. He assumes a batting posture and begins to taunt Death, the fastball in the outside corner. troy: Come on! It’s between you and me now! A static-y growl starts, building into a roar. Troy taunts the pitcher as the light gives way to complete darkness: troy: Come on! Anytime you want! Come on! I be ready for you . . . but I ain’t gonna be easy.

They let Lyons come. Your Uncle Gabe’s still in the hospital. They don’t know if they gonna let him out or not. I just talked to them a little while ago.

Ain’t she precious? She gonna break a whole lot of hearts. Raynell hides behind the banisters. Rose: Raynell, come and say hello to your brother. This is your brother, Cory. You remember Cory. RAYNELL: No, ma’am. cory: She don’t remember me, Mama. ROSE: Well, we talk about you. She heard us talk about you. This is your brother, Cory. (to Raynell) Come on and say hello.

Lyons (Pausz): I always knew you was gonna make some- thing out yourself. Your head was always in the right direction. So . . . you gonna stay in make it a career . . . put in your twenty years? cory: I don’t know. I got six already, I think that’s enough. Lyons: Stick with Uncle Sam and retire early.

I seen him strike out three times in a row. . . and the next time up he hit the ball over the grandstand. Right out there in Homestead Field. He wasn’t satisfied hitting in the seats . . . he wanted to hit it over every- thing! After the game he had two hundred people standing around waiting to shake his hand. You got to take the crookeds with the straights. Yeah, Papa was something else. cory: You still playing? Lyons: Cory . . . you know I’m gonna do that. There’s some fellows down there we got us a band. . . we gonna try and stay together when we get out but yeah, I’m still playing. Rose calls from the kitchen: Rosz: Lyons, I got these eggs in the pan. iyons: Let me go on and get these eggs, man. Get ready to go bury Papa. (a beat, then) How you doing? You doing all right? Cory nods. Lyons touches him on the shoulder and they share a moment of silent grief. Lyons goes into the kitchen.

He walks toward it as he hears ROSE (AS SHE COMES DOWN BACK STEPS): Ain’t too much chang He still got that piece of rag tied to that tree. He was out here swinging that bat. I was just ready to go back in the house. He swung that bat and then he just fell over. Seem like he swung it and stood there with this grin on his face . . . and then he just fell over. They car- ried him on down to the hospital but I knew there wasn’t no need . . . why don’t you come on in the house. cory: Mama . . . I got something to tell you.

You just get that thought out of your head. cory: I’ve got to say no to him. One time in my life I’ve got to say no. RoszE: Don’t nobody have to listen to nothing like that. I know you and your daddy ain’t seen eye to eye, but I ain’t gotta listen to that kind of talk this morning. Disrespecting your daddy ain't gonna make you a man, Cory. You got to find a way to come to that on your own. Not going to your daddy’s funeral ain’t gonna make you a man. Cory looks around, trying to find what to say. Then: cory: The whole time I was growing up . . . living in his house . . . Papa was like a shadow that fol- lowed you everywhere. It weighed on you and sunk into your flesh. It would wrap around you and lay there until you couldn’t tell which one was you anymore. That shadow digging in your flesh. Trying to crawl in. Trying to live through you. I’m just 136 9780735217867 Fences.indd 136 11/1516 1:50 PM

ROSE: You Troy Maxson all over again. cory: I don’t want to be Troy Maxson. I want to be me. Rose: You can’t be nobody but who you are, Cory. That shadow wasn’t nothing but you growing into your- self. You either got to grow into it or cut it down to fit you. But that’s all you got to make life with. That’s all you got to measure yourself against that world out there. Your daddy wanted you to be everything he wasn’t . . . and at the same time he tried to make you into everything he was. I don’t know if he was right or wrong but I do know he meant to do more good than he meant to do harm. She stops, overwhelmed. Cory puts his hand on her hand. She takes his hand, squeezes it, turns it over, holding on. ROSE: Sometimes when he touched he bruised. And some- times when he took me in his arms he cut. (beat) When I first met your daddy I thought, “Here is aman I can lay down with and make a baby.” That’s the first thing I thought when I seen him “Rose Lee, here is a man that you can open your- 137 9780735217867 Fences.indd 137 11/1516 1:50 PM

Cory gets up, crosses over to the tree. Rose stands at the screen door watching him. She takes a look at the threat- ening sky, about to return to the house, when she sees Gabriel. He’s older but healthier, more vi- tal, in a new suit and a hat. One arm is behind his back. Rose is speechless with surprise. GABRIEL: Hey, Rose! ROSE: Gabe? GaBRIEL: I’m here, Rose.

He takes his hand from behind him and holds his trumpet aloft. GABRIEL: Hey, Rose. It’s time. It’s time to tell Saint Peter to open the Gates. Not knowing what she’s agreeing to, Rose nods. GABRIEL: Troy, you ready? Gabriel waits for an answer. Raynell comes out on the porch and hides behind Rose, shy. Gabe smiles at her, and she returns his smile. GABRIEL: You ready, Troy. I’m gonna tell Saint Peter to open the Gates. You get ready now. Gabriel puts the trumpet to his lips, two decades of waiting for this moment 141 9780735217867_Fences.indd 141 11/1516 1:50 PM
