But I’ll say this for him. . . he felt a respon- sibility toward us. Maybe he ain’t treated us the way I felt he should have . . . but without that responsibility he could have walked off and left us . . . made his own way. Bono: A lot of them did.

All you got to do is heat it up. And don’t you be eating the rest of them cakes in there. I’m coming back for 116 9780735217867 Fences.indd 116 11/1516 1:50 PM
56) 3) text: them. We having a bake sale at the church tomor- row. Rose shuts the door firmly. Troy stands there, listening to her going down the steps. He stands alone in the empty house, unsure of what to do. He flaps the money he’s holding. He goes to the dining room table and puts his cash next to Lyons’ twenty. He pockets the twenty and starts for the door. INT. TAYLORS’ BAR—LATE AFTERNOON Troy sits alone at the bar, a generous glass of gin before him. He takes a sip. Someone pulls out the stool next to him and starts to sit. Troy looks. It’s Bono. Bono: Hey, Troy. troy: Hey, what’s happening, Bono? Bono: I just thought I’d stop by to see you. Wasn’t no one at the house, so I figured - troy: What you stop by and see me for? You ain’t stopped by the house in a month of Sundays. Hell, I must owe you money or something.

They let Lyons come. Your Uncle Gabe’s still in the hospital. They don’t know if they gonna let him out or not. I just talked to them a little while ago. Lyons: A corporal in the United States Marines. BoNo: Your daddy knew you had it in you. He used to tell me all the time.

Ain’t she precious? She gonna break a whole lot of hearts. Raynell hides behind the banisters. Rose: Raynell, come and say hello to your brother. This is your brother, Cory. You remember Cory.

I seen him strike out three times in a row. . . and the next time up he hit the ball over the grandstand. Right out there in Homestead Field. He wasn’t satisfied hitting in the seats . . . he wanted to hit it over every- thing! After the game he had two hundred people standing around waiting to shake his hand.

Cory nods. Lyons touches him on the shoulder and they share a moment of silent grief. Lyons goes into the kitchen. Cory looks up to the top of the stairs and sees Raynell, in her 133 9780735217867 Fences.indd 133 11/1516 1:50 PM

I told you they’d let him come. cory: How you doing, Uncle Gabe? Lyons: How you doing, Uncle Gabe? Gabriel looks at each of them, then back to Rose. He takes his hand from behind him and holds his trumpet aloft. GABRIEL: Hey, Rose. It’s time. It’s time to tell Saint Peter to open the Gates. Not knowing what she’s agreeing to, Rose nods. GABRIEL: Troy, you ready? Gabriel waits for an answer. Raynell comes out on the porch and hides behind Rose, shy. Gabe smiles at her, and she returns his smile. GABRIEL: You ready, Troy. I’m gonna tell Saint Peter to open the Gates. You get ready now. Gabriel puts the trumpet to his lips, two decades of waiting for this moment 141 9780735217867_Fences.indd 141 11/1516 1:50 PM

Then Gabe begins to dance, slow and strange, eerie, skeletal and life- giving, a dance of atavistic signature and ritual. Lyons goes to Gabe, embracing him, trying to stop him. Gabriel pushes Lyons away. He points the trumpet at the ground and inhales as he arcs the horn upwards till he’s on his toes, closing his eyes, putting the mouthpiece to his lips; Gabriel blows once more, and: From the tarnished, battered bell of the broken trumpet comes an ear- splitting note, growing higher and louder till it’s almost like a woman's scream. In the clouds directly above Gabe, a small aperture opens up and a pillar of brilliant light descends, bathing Gabriel and his horn in gold. The trumpet’s blast stops; the silence is huge and abrupt. CLOSE-UP: Gabriel, his face raised up, bathed in light. He lowers his trumpet. He says to God: casRIEL: That’s the way that go! 142 9780735217867 Fences.indd 142 11/1516 1:50 PM
