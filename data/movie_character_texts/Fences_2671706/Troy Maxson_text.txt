Bono: Well, as long as you got your complaint filed, they can’t fire you. That’s what one of them white fellows tell me. troy: I ain’t worried about them firing me. They gonna fire me ‘cause I asked a question? That’s all I did. I went to Mr. Rand and asked him—“Why?

Bono: I told Brownie if the man come and ask him any questions . . . just tell the truth! It ain’t nothing but something they done trumped up on you "cause you filed a complaint on them. Bono returns the last empty can. Troy climbs up on the truck. troy: Brownie don’t understand nothing. All I want them to do is change the job description. Give everybody a chance to drive the truck. Brownie can’t see that. He ain’t got that much sense. Bono in place, Troy slaps the truck. As it starts moving, Troy pulls a lever and the compactor crushes the trash.

Bono: I ain’t saying that. I see where you be eyeing her. troy: I eye all the women. I don’t miss nothing. Don’t never let nobody tell you Troy Maxson don’t eye the women. BoNo: You been doing more than eyeing her. You done bought her a drink or two. troy: Hell yeah, I bought her a drink! What that mean? I bought you one, too. What that mean ‘cause I buy her a drink? I’m just being polite. pono: It’s all right to buy her one drink. That’s what you call being polite. But when you wanna be buy- ing two or three . . . that’s what you call eye- ing her. troy: Look here, as long as you known me... you ever known me to chase after women? BoNo: Hell yeah!

Woman wears some big stockings. Got them great big old legs and hips as wide as the Mississippi river. troy: Legs don’t mean nothing. You don’t do nothing but push them out of the way.

Materials for a new fence. ..a couple of wooden sawhorses waiting for the lumber stacked under a tarp. One or two chairs of dubious value sit at one end where the kitchen window opens onto the porch. An old-fashioned ice box stands silent guard at the other end. Rose maxson comes out onto the porch, holding a bowl of snap peas. She is ten years younger than troy. Her devotion to him stems from the recognition of the possibilities of her life without him: a succession of abusive men and their babies, a life of partying and running the streets, the church, or aloneness with its attendant pain and frustration. She recognizes troy’s spirit as a fine and illuminating one and she either ignores or forgives his faults, only some of which she recognizes. Though she doesn’t drink, her presence is an integral part of the friday night rituals. 9780735217867 Fences.indd 8 11/1516 1:50 PM

I’m talking about what she charge. She charge ten cents more than the A&P. troy: The A&P ain’t never done nothing for me. I spends my money where I’m treated right. I go down to Bella, say, “I need a loaf of bread, I’11 pay you Friday.” She give it to me. What sense that make when I got money to go and spend it somewhere else and ignore the person who done right by me? That ain’t in the Bible. ROsE: We ain’t talking about what’s in the Bible.

Bono’s gonna die. Hell, we all gonna die. ROSE: But you ain’t got to talk about it. I don’t like to talk about it. troy: You the one brought it up. Me and Bono was talking about baseball... you tell me I’m gonna drink myself to death. Ain’t that right, Bono? You know I don’t drink this but one night out of the week. That’s Friday night. I’m gonna drink just enough to where I can handle it. Then I cuts it loose. I leave it alone. So don’t you worry about me drinking myself to death. ’Cause I ain’t worried about Death.

I got cold as ice and Death standing there grinning at me. RoszE: Troy, why don’t you hush that talk. moy: I say . . . “What you want, Mr. Death? You be wanting me? You done brought your army to be get- ting me?” I looked him dead in the eye. I wasn’t fearing nothing. I was ready to tangle. Just like I’m ready to tangle now. The bible say be ever vigilant. That’s why I don’t get but so drunk. I got to keep watch. Ros (To Bono): Troy was right down there in Mercy Hos- pital. You remember he had pneumonia?

Finally he say, “You want bound over for another year?” See, just like that . . . “You want bound over for another year?” I told him, “Bound over hell! Let’s settle this now!” It seem like he kinda fell back when I said that, and all the cold went out of me. I reached down and grabbed that sickle and threw it just as far as I could throw it . . . and me and him com- menced to wrestling. We wrestled for three days and three nights.

Rose: Every time Troy tell that story he find different ways to tell it. Different things to make up about it. troy: I ain’t making up nothing. I’m telling you the facts of what happened. I wrestled with Death for three days and three nights and I’m standing here to tell you about it... All right. At the end of the third night we done weakened each other to where we can’t hardly move. Death stood up, throwed on his robe . . . had him a white robe with a hood on it. Troy mimics a Klansman’s hood. Bono laughs at this; Rose does the same in spite of herself. troy: He throwed on that robe and went off to look for his sickle. Say, “I'll be back.” Just like that. “I’11 be back.” I told him say, “Yeah, but you gonna have to find me!” I wasn’t no fool. I wasn’t going looking for him. Death ain’t nothing to play with.

I can fix it as soon I finish hanging up these clothes. troy: I got the coffee on. That’ll be all right. I’1l just drink some of that this morning. ROSE (CRANKING THE MANGLE): That 651 hit yesterday. That’ the second time this month. Miss Pearl hit for a dollar . . . seem like those that need the least always get lucky. Poor folks can’t get nothing. mroy: Them numbers don’t know nobody. I don’t know why you fool with them. You and Lyons both. Rose: It’s something to do. moy: You ain’t doing nothing but throwing your money away. Rose stops wringing out the clothes and takes him on. Rose: Troy, you know I don’t play foolishly. I just play a nickel here and a nickel there. moy: That’s two nickels you done thrown away. ROSE: Now I hit sometimes . . . that makes up for it. It always come in handy when I do hit. I don’t hear you complaining then. 30 9780735217867 Fences.indd 30 11/1516 1:50 PM

If I had all the money nig- gers . . . these Negroes, throw away on numbers for one week—just one week—I’d be a rich man. Troy heads inside as Rose brings the laundry basket to the line and hangs it. ROSE (T0 TROY IN THE KITCHEN): Well, you wishing and call ing it foolish ain’t gonna stop folks from play- ing numbers. That's one thing for sure. Besides . . . some good things come from playing numbers. Look where Pope done bought him that restaurant off of numbers. Troy comes out, cup of coffee in hand. troy: I can’t stand niggers like that. Man ain’t had two dimes to rub together. He walking around with his shoes all run over bumming money for ciga- rettes. All right. Got lucky there and hit the numbers Rose: Troy, I know all about it. troy: Had good sense, I'll say that for him. He ain’t throwed his money away. Troy goes down the steps toward the ruined fence. troy: I seen niggers hit the numbers and go through two thousand dollars in four days. Man brought him that restaurant down there . . . fixed it up 31 9780735217867_Fences.indd 31 11/1516 1:50 PM

Pope picked all the meat out the pot for him. Man ain’t had noth- ing but a bowl of meat! Negro come behind him and ain’t got nothing but the potatoes and carrots. Talking about what numbers do for people, you picked a wrong example. Ain’t done nothing but make a worser fool out of him than he was before. Rose comes out from behind the hanging laundry. RosE: Troy, you ought to stop worrying about what hap- pened at work yesterday. troy: I ain’t worried. Just told me to be down there at the commissioner’s office on Friday. Everybody think they gonna fire me. I ain’t worried about them firing me. You ain’t got to worry about that. (pause) Where’s Cory? Cory in the house? (loud)

Go on back in there and go to bed . . . get up on the other side. mroy: Why something got to be wrong with me? I ain’t said nothing wrong with me. ROSE: You got something to say about everything. First it’s the numbers . . . then it’s the way the man runs his restaurant . . . then you done got on Cory. What’s it gonna be next? Take a look up there and see if the weather suits you... or is it gonna be how you gonna put up the fence with the clothes hanging in the yard. troy: You hit the nail on the head then. Rrosz: I know you like I know the back of my hand. Come on in here and get you some more coffee . . . see if that straighten you up. (going into the house) "Cause you ain’t right this morning.

Rose comes out on the porch. GABRIEL: Hey, Rose! RosE: How you doing, Gabe? She continues down the steps, past Troy, and up to Gabe. Troy looks up and down the street, embarrassed. One or two old people are watching from windows and stoops. RosE: What you got there? GABRIEL: You know what I got, Rose. I got fruits and vegetables. Rose looks through his basket, treating the produce carefully. RosE: Where’s all these plums you talking about? aBRIEL: I ain’t got no plums today, Rose.

GABRIEL (10 ROSE): Did you know when I was in Heaven every morning me and Saint Peter would sit down by the Gate and eat some big fat biscuits? Troy sees a pair of old ladies across the street, whispering. GABRIEL: Oh, yeah! We had us a good time. We’d sit there and eat us them biscuits and then Saint Pe- ter would go off to sleep and tell me to wake him up when it’s time to open the Gates for the Judg- ment. Ros: Well, come on, I’1l make up a batch of biscuits. caBRIEL: Troy . . . Saint Peter got your name in the book. I seen it. It say... Troy Maxson. I say... I know him! He got the same name like what I got. That’s my brother! troy: How many times you gonna tell me that, Gabe? GapRIEL: Ain’t got my name in the book. Don’t have to have my name. I done died and went to Heaven. He got your name though. One morning Saint Peter was looking at his book . . . marking it up for the Judgment . . . and he let me see your name.

Remember how we used to eat them flapjacks? troy: Go on in the house and get you something to eat now. capRIEL: I got to go sell my plums. I done sold some tomatoes. Got me two quarters. Wanna see? He shows his quarters to Troy, then pockets them. GABRIEL: I’m gonna save them and buy me a new horn so Saint Peter can hear me when it’s time to open the Gates. (turning with a sudden violence) Hear that? Hear that? That’s the hellhounds. I got to chase them out of here. Go on get out of here! Get out!

Man got half his head blown away what you expect? Troy pours himself a second cup of coffee. Rosz: Seem like something ought to be done to help him. troy: Man don’t bother nobody. He just mixed up from that metal plate he got in his head. Ain’t no sense for him to go back into the hospital. Rose: Least he be eating right.

Rose: Is you fixing to go into that again? troy: That’s the only way I got a roof over my head . . . ‘cause of that metal plate. Rosz: Ain’t no sense you blaming yourself for nothing. Gabe wasn’t in no condition to manage that money. You done what was right by him. Can’t nobody say you ain’t done what was right by him. Look how long you took care of him. . . till he wanted to have his own place and moved over there with Miss Pearl. moy: That ain’t what I’m saying, woman! I’m just stating the facts. If my brother didn’t have that metal plate in his head . . . I wouldn’t have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. And I’m fifty-three years old. Now see if you can un- derstand that!

Now, how much you think it cost to get that roof tarred? cory (stops sawinc): I don’t know. mroy: Two hundred and sixty-four dollars . . . cash money. While you thinking about a TV, I got to be thinking about the roof . . . and whatever else go wrong around here. Now if you had two hundred dollars, what would you do... fix the roof or buy a TV? cory: I’d buy a TV. Then when the roof started to leak . . . when it needed fixing . . . I'd fix it. Cory hurls a finished plank aside and grabs the next one. troy: Where are you gonna get the money from? You done spent it for a TV. You gonna sit up and watch the water run all over your brand-new TV. cory: Aw, Pop. You got money.

ROSE: He thinks Troy’s mad at him ’cause he moved over to Miss Pearl’s. troy: I ain’t mad at the man. He can live where he want to live at. Lyons: What he move over there for? Miss Pearl don’t like nobody. ROSE: She don’t mind him none. She treats him real nice. She just don’t allow all that singing. troy: She don’t mind that rent he be paying that’s what she don’t mind.

Didn’t know if I was gonna be in one place long enough to fix on them right as their daddy. I fig- ured I was going searching too. Bono sips, hands the bottle to Lyons, who takes a big swig. Bono: As it turned out I been hooked up with Lucille near about as long as your daddy been with Rose. Going on sixteen years. troy: Sometimes I wish I hadn’t known my daddy. He ain’t cared nothing about no kids. A kid to him wasn’t nothing. All he wanted was for you to learn how to walk so he could start you to work- ing.

Make sure they have something to eat. troy: The only thing my daddy cared about was getting them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin. That’s the only thing that mattered to him. Sometimes I used to wonder why he was living. Wonder why the devil hadn’t come and got him. “Get them bales of cot- ton in to Mr. Lubin” and find out he owe him money tyons: He should have just went on and left when he saw he couldn’t get nowhere. That’s what I would have done. troy: How he gonna leave with eleven kids? And where he gonna go? He ain’t knew how to do nothing but farm. No, he was trapped and I think he knew it. But I’ll say this for him. . . he felt a respon- sibility toward us. Maybe he ain’t treated us the way I felt he should have . . . but without that responsibility he could have walked off and left us . . . made his own way. Bono: A lot of them did. Back in those days what you talking about... they walk out their front door and just take on down one road or another and keep on walking. 68 9780735217867 Fences.indd 68 11/1516 1:50 PM

Went to rob this fellow . . . pulled out my knife and he pulled out a gun. Shot me in the chest. It felt just like somebody had taken a hot branding iron and laid it on me.

That’s where I learned how to play baseball. Got out that place and your mama had taken you and went on to make a life without me.

Seem like that would be the best place for him if they did put him into the hospital. I know what you're gonna say. But that’s what I think would be best. troy: The man done had his life ruined fighting for what? And they wanna take and lock him up. Let him be free. He don’t bother nobody.

He leans out, breathing hard, looking down into the dark yard, the abandoned house beyond the fence. He feels the darkness pull at him, making him lean farther out.

Making a show of it he buttons his collar, clips the tie into place, and walks out the right side alley, all without giving his father a glance.

All you ever did was try and make me scared of you. I used to tremble every time you called my name. Every time I heard your foot- steps in the house. Wondering all the time what’s Papa gonna say if I do this? . . . What's he gonna say if I do that? . . . What’s Papa gonna say if I turn on the radio? And Mama, too she tries . . . but she’s scared of you. moy: You leave your mama out of this.

If you don’t get on the other side of that yard... I’m gonna show you how crazy I am! Goon. . . get the hell out of my yard. cory: It ain’t your yard. You took Uncle Gabe’s money he got from the Army to buy this house and then you put him out. troy: Get your black ass out of my yard! Troy’s advance backs Cory up against the tree. Cory grabs up the bat. cory: I ain’t going nowhere! Come on . . . put me out! I ain’t scared of you. troy: That’s my bat! cory: Come on!

Troy continues to advance toward him. troy: You’re gonna have to kill me! You wanna draw that bat back on me. You’re gonna have to kill me. Cory, backed up against the tree, can go no farther. Troy taunts him. He sticks out his head and offers him a target. troy: Come on! Come on! Cory is unable to swing the bat. Troy grabs it. mrox: Then 1711 show you. Cory and Troy struggle over the bat. The struggle is fierce and fully Troy ultimately is the engaged. and takes the bat from Cory stronger, and stands over him ready to swing. He stops himself. Go on and get away from around my house.

Troy starts toward the tree with the bat, staggering, sick exhausted, his mouth horribly dry. He tries to moisten it with this tongue: no use. troy: I can’t taste nothing. Hallelujah! I can’t taste nothing no more. He assumes a batting posture and begins to taunt Death, the fastball in the outside corner. troy: Come on! It’s between you and me now! A static-y growl starts, building into a roar. Troy taunts the pitcher as the light gives way to complete darkness: troy: Come on! Anytime you want! Come on! I be ready for you . . . but I ain’t gonna be easy.

I'll be back to get you all. RosE: Thanks, Jim. cory: See you, Mr. Bono. Bono goes out the front door. No one speaks. Then Lyons points to Raynell on the stairs. Lyons: Cory, look at Raynell. Ain’t she precious? She gonna break a whole lot of hearts. Raynell hides behind the banisters. Rose: Raynell, come and say hello to your brother. This is your brother, Cory. You remember Cory. RAYNELL: No, ma’am. cory: She don’t remember me, Mama. ROSE: Well, we talk about you. She heard us talk about you. This is your brother, Cory. (to Raynell) Come on and say hello.

62) 0) text: Cory comes down the steps into the yard, taking it all in. He sees Troy’s bat leaning against the tree. He walks toward it as he hears ROSE (AS SHE COMES DOWN BACK STEPS): Ain’t too much chang He still got that piece of rag tied to that tree. He was out here swinging that bat. I was just ready to go back in the house. He swung that bat and then he just fell over. Seem like he swung it and stood there with this grin on his face . . . and then he just fell over. They car- ried him on down to the hospital but I knew there wasn’t no need . . . why don’t you come on in the house. cory: Mama . . . I got something to tell you.

ROSE: You Troy Maxson all over again. cory: I don’t want to be Troy Maxson. I want to be me. Rose: You can’t be nobody but who you are, Cory. That shadow wasn’t nothing but you growing into your- self. You either got to grow into it or cut it down to fit you. But that’s all you got to make life with. That’s all you got to measure yourself against that world out there. Your daddy wanted you to be everything he wasn’t . . . and at the same time he tried to make you into everything he was. I don’t know if he was right or wrong but I do know he meant to do more good than he meant to do harm. She stops, overwhelmed. Cory puts his hand on her hand. She takes his hand, squeezes it, turns it over, holding on. ROSE: Sometimes when he touched he bruised. And some- times when he took me in his arms he cut. (beat) When I first met your daddy I thought, “Here is aman I can lay down with and make a baby.” That’s the first thing I thought when I seen him “Rose Lee, here is a man that you can open your- 137 9780735217867 Fences.indd 137 11/1516 1:50 PM

I told you they’d let him come. cory: How you doing, Uncle Gabe? Lyons: How you doing, Uncle Gabe? Gabriel looks at each of them, then back to Rose. He takes his hand from behind him and holds his trumpet aloft. GABRIEL: Hey, Rose. It’s time. It’s time to tell Saint Peter to open the Gates. Not knowing what she’s agreeing to, Rose nods. GABRIEL: Troy, you ready? Gabriel waits for an answer. Raynell comes out on the porch and hides behind Rose, shy. Gabe smiles at her, and she returns his smile. GABRIEL: You ready, Troy. I’m gonna tell Saint Peter to open the Gates. You get ready now. Gabriel puts the trumpet to his lips, two decades of waiting for this moment 141 9780735217867_Fences.indd 141 11/1516 1:50 PM
