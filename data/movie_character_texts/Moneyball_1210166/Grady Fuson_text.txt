10) 7) dialog: Alright, guys... we had a great year. We won 102 games and we only came a buck short in New York. Now the bad news... we've got three big holes to fill.
10) 48) dialog: Artie, who do we like?
10) 56) dialog: He's notable?
10) 76) dialog: Is that a suggestion, Billy?
10) 79) dialog: We're trying to solve the problem. 21. 21.
10) 84) dialog: We not only have a very clear understanding of the problem we now face, but everyone in this room has faced similar problems countless times before.
10) 88) dialog: The problem is that we've lost 3 key players that we now have to replace.
10) 103) dialog: Look, we're gonna find 25 guys, put `em through player development, teach `em how to play Oakland A baseball. This is no time to push the panic button. This is the way we've been doing it for 150 years. Let us do our job.
10) 107) dialog: That's fortune cookie wisdom.
10) 111) dialog: Okay, Billy. Clearly you have something on your mind.
10) 118) dialog: Bill James was a night security guard at the Stokely Van Camp Pork and Beans Factory.
10) 121) dialog: He's not in baseball. He's in pork and beans. 23. 23.
10) 135) dialog: With all due respect, we've been doing this for a long time.
10) 142) dialog: Billy, I've seen Garcia. He's got a bad body. It's not a pretty sight.
10) 149) dialog: He's not just big, but kind of doughy. A fleshy kind of body.
29) 2) dialog: How did it go in Cleveland?
29) 6) dialog: Let's get after our relief pitching problem.
29) 11) dialog: Submariner?
29) 13) dialog: What's his velocity?
29) 18) dialog: Does he have a good breaking ball?
29) 22) dialog: Why do you like this guy?
29) 28) dialog: He's down there. He's down there real low, too.
29) 34) dialog: Well, we, I think, have fared better. We have some ideas for what to do about Giambi.
29) 37) dialog: We trade power for speed. A rabbit for a gorilla - We go for an overachiever. A big heart in the last year his contract. Tend to play hard. We usually get a pretty good year out of them. Make up for some of the offense we lost. (puts more names up) Or the other option. Just a thought. We go for a high-maintenance guy. A guy that's a little difficult but talented. A guy like Milton Bradley. Well, not like Milton. Milton himself. Which do you want to talk about first?
29) 46) dialog: The (what) -
29) 68) dialog: Billy?
29) 73) dialog: Who's that?
29) 77) dialog: I don't know how to say this delicately - but does - Peter - need to be here?
29) 91) dialog: This guy could start the year with an agent and end up with a parole officer for Christ's sake.
29) 99) dialog: Ten years ago he was a big name. He's going to really help our season tickets at the beginning of the year. But by June he's not going to be hitting his weight.
29) 110) dialog: And why do we want to be the ones to bail Justice out of his contract?
29) 114) dialog: I got 37 free agents who are better than those guys.
29) 123) dialog: Some damage? He can't throw.
29) 126) dialog: Wait, you're talkin' about Hatteberg at first?
29) 137) dialog: Let me understand this. At first base you want a guy who's been cut from half of the minor league teams in the country due to irreparable nerve damage?
29) 158) dialog: You want to replace Jason Giambi with not one but three defective players?
29) 161) dialog: Billy, we've all been busting our asses the last six and a half weeks to make this a better ball--
42) 26) dialog: Can we talk a minute?
43) 3) dialog: Your boy and I had a talk while you were in Tacoma. I didn't like much of what I heard.
43) 5) dialog: No. You got a kid in there with a Yale economics degree and a scout out here with 29 years baseball experience and you're listening to the wrong one.
43) 8) dialog: This isn't a joke.
43) 13) dialog: This isn't how you run a ball club, with a computer. You know that. You're a baseball man. There are intangibles that only a scout can see in a player that you're not going to pick up with just numbers, with someone who doesn't play the game, who knows nothing about the game but how to feed numbers into a computer.
43) 16) dialog: If this is what baseball is, if it's not Kirk Gibson going up to the plate on two bad legs because the manager felt in his heart that he had one swing left in that body... a computer wouldn't do that. They would have had him sitting up in the stands.
43) 20) dialog: Well, romance and the fans, it's called a love affair with the game and it's been going on for one hundred and fifty years.
43) 24) dialog: You're saying everybody's been wrong? Everybody? Beat.
43) 25) dialog: Are you saying everybody's been wrong?
43) 35) dialog: --we're gonna see if you're right?! This is about you and your shit? Some scouts from 20 years ago called it wrong, okay? They thought you were a ballplayer and you weren't. As you know, it happens. Don't take it out on--
43) 39) dialog: I'm trying to help, okay, I'm saying--
43) 44) dialog: 
43) 49) dialog: Major League Baseball and its fans will be happy to hand you and Google Boy your heads if you keep doing what you're doing here, I don't give a shit about friendship this situation or the past. Major League Baseball thinks the way I think. You're not gonna win. And I'll give you a nickel's worth of free advice.
43) 54) dialog: You're making it impossible for yourself to get another job once Schott fires you after this catastrophic season you're setting us all up for and you're gonna have to explain to your wife and your kid why you're working at Dick's Sporting Goods.
43) 58) dialog: Go fuck yourself, Billy.
