2) 2) dialog: It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on. It's no big deal.
2) 6) dialog: How's Meg?
2) 11) dialog: And the boys?
2) 14) dialog: That's good. The security guard waits for the baseball to sail through the glass, but it doesn't happen.
2) 16) dialog: Night.
3) 3) dialog: Yeah...
3) 6) dialog: No. That would be, uh--
3) 9) dialog: Are you asking me to pick one?
3) 12) dialog: I'll be honest, right this minute I'm not thinking about either of those things. 4. 4.
3) 16) dialog: They were down two-love and then beat us three in a row. Trust me, the better team won.
3) 22) dialog: That sounds good.
3) 26) dialog: How about Oakland?
3) 30) dialog: Yeah.
3) 34) dialog: Yeah.
3) 39) dialog: Great. I'm on my way.
4) 2) dialog: Is it Boston? You're talking to Boston? What are they offering?
4) 5) dialog: What?!
4) 8) dialog: You don't know that.
4) 13) dialog: I don't know that -- since I don't know what they're offering.
4) 19) dialog: Scott? Scott?
4) 22) dialog: What did they offer?
4) 26) dialog: Just to be clear -- they offered seven and a quarter.
4) 29) dialog: As opposed to you said seven and a quarter and they're thinking about it.
4) 32) dialog: I'm thinking I don't want to lose Damon, but I don't pay my whole infield seven million dollars.
4) 37) dialog: Wait, don't hang up. Don't hang up --
4) 42) dialog: What's the difference? 7. 7.
4) 48) dialog: It's already through. Billy grabs his phone from the other side.
4) 50) dialog: Seven point five?
4) 54) dialog: I'll talk to Steve.
4) 61) dialog: (hitting speed dial on another number) A small emergency is starting to develop.
4) 64) dialog: You look fantastic today.
4) 68) dialog: Arn. Billy. We gotta talk about Giambi.
4) 74) dialog: We can talk now. We're talking now. 8. 8.
4) 79) dialog: Who are you talking to -- the Yankees?
4) 83) dialog: Don't hang up.
4) 91) dialog: Denise. Billy.
4) 97) dialog: I know, I just want to send him flowers.
4) 101) dialog: Where would I send them?
4) 104) dialog: To Arn. 9. 9.
4) 112) dialog: To where he is now, yes.
4) 118) dialog: 
4) 125) dialog: I know. I need a day.
4) 128) dialog: 
4) 130) dialog: One day. I'll fly out tomorrow.
4) 135) dialog: Only if my luck stays exactly the same.
4) 139) dialog: I'm sorry. Have fun out there. 10. 10.
4) 144) dialog: A left-handed reliever if you can.
5) 3) dialog: How much longer you think?
5) 6) dialog: Nah, it's okay.
6) 4) dialog: Arn, I don't wanna lose him.
6) 6) dialog: 
6) 7) dialog: I don't wanna lose him.
6) 11) dialog: He did well with his Torah portion I thought.
6) 16) dialog: What did they offer?
6) 19) dialog: What did the Yankees offer him?
6) 21) dialog: What did they offer?
6) 25) dialog: No way.
6) 28) dialog: I don't pay my whole infield 17 million dollars.
6) 31) dialog: For how long?
6) 35) dialog: A hundred and twenty million dollars?
6) 40) dialog: That's pretty good advice, I should do that. 12. 12.
6) 45) dialog: Arn. I get it, he gets it, Jason gets it and you certainly get it. I'll talk to him.
6) 48) dialog: Ya think?
6) 50) dialog: Hey mazel tov, Arn.
6) 55) dialog: Yes.
6) 58) dialog: Are you from around here?
6) 62) dialog: You a Dodger fan?
6) 66) dialog: Here, drink a lot of this.
7) 2) dialog: We're losing Damon and Giambi. We can't survive losing Damon and Giambi.
7) 5) dialog: I can win without a closer. I can't without power.
7) 9) dialog: I have. They want more.
7) 12) dialog: I have. They want more than a little more.
7) 15) dialog: 
7) 19) dialog: One.
7) 26) dialog: I can't.
7) 29) dialog: 
7) 32) dialog: Fine. He's gone. But I might - for a bit more than last year - be able to keep Damon in (Oakland) - (Steve is shaking his
7) 36) dialog: I can't compete against a hundred and twenty million dollar payroll with a forty million dollar payroll.
7) 39) dialog: With Giambi and Damon. We wouldn't have without them. Silence. Then -
7) 40) dialog: You can't ask me to be okay with losing. That's too much to ask a professional athlete.
7) 43) dialog: 
7) 44) dialog: It's too much, Steve!
8) 3) dialog: Scott. Billy.
8) 6) dialog: It's just my phone, it's about to die, but this'll be quick - listen - I'm losing my favorite prospects, but I got you the seven point five.
8) 10) dialog: No. No, you won't. I got it for you and we're done. Damon stays in Oakland.
8) 13) dialog: Whose number is that - seven point five. Mine?
8) 16) dialog: It's yours. So make your call, but don't play me, Scott. We have a deal. I won't be a stalking horse. The word stays in the - dictionary. 16. 16.
9) 2) dialog: Sorry, hon. I'm gonna need another day.
9) 5) dialog: You've got my suitcase?
9) 7) dialog: 
9) 11) dialog: (beat, can this get any worse?) Okay.
9) 14) dialog: I gotta take this.
9) 18) dialog: Yeah.
9) 22) dialog: No, you didn't. 17. 17.
9) 27) dialog: No, I have Johnny for seven-point-five or he's not playing anywhere, because that's the deal --
9) 32) dialog: We had a deal.
9) 35) dialog: Why am I the ugliest girl at the dance, Scott? Why do I get the feeling I'm always gonna be a quarter million short?
9) 39) dialog: No, you played me. And you're playing me now. Congratulations, asshole. You win. Billy hangs up on him.
10) 21) dialog: Can he hit?
10) 24) dialog: Can he hit?
10) 28) dialog: So you're saying he can't hit.
10) 40) dialog: That's not what I asked. I asked can he hit.
10) 44) dialog: If he's a good hitter, why doesn't he hit good?
10) 46) dialog: Right... we put him up against big league competition and suddenly he'll be able to hit.
10) 77) dialog: Guys, stop. You're talking like this is business as usual. It's not.
10) 82) dialog: Not like this. You're not even looking at the problem.
10) 86) dialog: Good. What's the problem?
10) 90) dialog: Uh-uh. What's the problem?
10) 94) dialog: Uh-uh. What's the problem?
10) 98) dialog: Okay, stop. The problem we're trying to solve is that this is an unfair game. There are rich teams, poor teams, 50 feet of crap and then there's us. And now we've been gutted. We're organ donors to the rich. The Red Sox took our kidneys and the Yankees took our heart. And now I'm listening to the same old shit about having a good body and being a tools guy like you're looking for Fabio. Is there another first baseman like Giambi?
10) 100) dialog: Then stop looking for one because what we'll surely wind up with is the McNuggets version of Giambi. 22. 22.
10) 105) dialog: If we try to play like the Yankees in here, we're not going to be able to play with them out there.
10) 108) dialog: No, it's just regular wisdom.
10) 112) dialog: Bill James.
10) 120) dialog: He thinks differently than anyone in baseball.
10) 124) dialog: Don't attack the man, attack the argument.
10) 129) dialog: What if we've been wrong this whole time about what ingredients manufacture a win? What if this whole time we thought it was the chicken that made the chicken soup taste good when really it was the onions that made the chicken soup taste good? Onions are a lot cheaper than chicken, you see what I'm saying?
10) 133) dialog: We gotta start over. We gotta rethink this thing. We gotta look where others aren't looking.
10) 137) dialog: That doesn't mean you're doing it right. Do you watch nature docs? You know what happens to the runt of the litter? He dies. I'm open to any solution, as long as it's not what the other guys are doing.
10) 151) dialog: Oh, you mean like Babe Ruth.
10) 161) dialog: Really?
10) 164) dialog: I should get Rincon?
10) 167) dialog: Okay. I'll also come back with Joe DiMaggio and Ty Cobb. And who would like a FabergГ© egg? Guys, you aren't hearing me -- in what universe can we afford Rincon?
10) 173) dialog: And when I come back, I want you to tell me something I don't already know. I want to question everything. We've got to rethink this game. As he exits --
10) 175) dialog: And Grady? Nobody cares about a 102 win season.
13) 4) dialog: Of course.
13) 10) dialog: Well, sir, I'd need to talk it out with my parents, decide if baseball is something I want to do full time. I have a scholarship to play football at Stanford.
14) 0) text: Unlike the A's, this is a franchise that can spend actual money on players, and on nice lobby furniture, which is where Billy sits, staring at a classic baseball photo that hangs in the lobby.
15) 5) dialog: 50 million in additional payroll.
15) 8) dialog: Ouch. 28. 28.
15) 13) dialog: I should've been a hitter.
15) 15) dialog: Supportive. Excited about rebuilding the team.
15) 18) dialog: Yeah, how do I afford the rest of the field?
15) 22) dialog: I guess you've touched the bottom of the sports industry when your opponent is
15) 26) dialog: 
15) 28) dialog: I need a lefty reliever and I want Ricardo Rincon.
15) 31) dialog: Not even a discussion?
15) 34) dialog: Why's that? You've got the Venezuelan kid in North Carolina you're bringing up.
15) 37) dialog: Well there goes my other idea. 29. 29.
15) 42) dialog: You have any outfielders I should be looking at?
15) 46) dialog: Yeah.
15) 49) dialog: Yeah. Who do you got?
15) 52) dialog: Tell me about Garcia.
15) 55) dialog: Is he healthy?
15) 60) dialog: He'll do. I can give you Guthrie for him if you kick in some cash.
15) 68) dialog: 
15) 73) dialog: Let's make it work, I'll go straight up with you, Garcia for Guthrie, no kicker.
16) 2) dialog: Hey.
16) 5) dialog: Who are you?
16) 9) dialog: What do you do?
16) 12) dialog: So what do you do? (pointing at co-
16) 19) dialog: Why does Mark listen to you?
16) 22) dialog: He just did.
16) 25) dialog: Really?
16) 27) dialog: Who are you?
16) 31) dialog: I don't give a rat's ass about your name.
16) 33) dialog: What happened in there?
16) 36) dialog: What did you tell Butch?
16) 40) dialog: 
16) 45) dialog: Meaning what? 32. 32.
16) 50) dialog: 
16) 53) dialog: Come on.
17) 1) dialog: Where you from Peter?
17) 4) dialog: Where did you go to school?
17) 7) dialog: I hate Yale.
17) 11) dialog: Kid from Yale once blocked a trade I was trying to make. What'd you study?
17) 15) dialog: What are you doing in baseball?
17) 19) dialog: I'm just curious. Why were you so cagey in there? 33. 33.
17) 24) dialog: I know, but I'm the first person in baseball who's ever talked to you this long. Right? Why is Garcia undervalued?
17) 28) dialog: Really? Why's that Peter?
17) 30) dialog: Oh really? What do you mean by that?
17) 33) dialog: Hey Pete, just say it. I'm not about to beat you up. Say what you've always wanted to say to a GM.
17) 35) dialog: Keep going, Peter.
17) 38) dialog: Peter, don't apologize for what you believe. 34. 34.
17) 54) dialog: You read Bill James, Pete?
17) 59) dialog: If this approach has been around for so long, why isn't anybody in baseball doing them?
21) 6) dialog: It's Billy Beane.
21) 8) dialog: I don't care. Would you have drafted me in the first round?
21) 11) dialog: After I left you ran me through your computer, right? Would you have drafted me in the first round?
21) 15) dialog: Would you have drafted me in the first round?
21) 20) dialog: Pack your suitcases.
21) 23) dialog: I just bought you from the Cleveland Indians.
23) 2) dialog: Good evening.
23) 6) dialog: I asked you to do three.
23) 10) dialog: To evaluate three available players.
23) 13) dialog: And how many did you do?
23) 18) dialog: 
23) 22) dialog: Talk me through the wall. PETER gets up and gives BILLY a tour of the dry erase boards.
23) 27) dialog: Let's make sure we're on the same page.
23) 30) dialog: We're going to re-think baseball.
23) 33) dialog: Look for an inefficiencies in statistics.
23) 35) dialog: Exploit the fact that unspectacular runs are just as valuable as 450-foot bombs.
23) 38) dialog: Why?
23) 40) dialog: 
23) 42) dialog: We believe there's a river that hasn't been fished.
23) 45) dialog: And because players have been overlooked because they don't rise to the standards of traditional baseball thinking, we believe that in this river, there are fish...fish who-- (BILLY lost it) Help me with--
23) 54) dialog: Yes. But let me ask you this. If our theory is right--
23) 58) dialog: If it's right--
23) 61) dialog: It sounds right.
23) 64) dialog: If math isn't a theory--
23) 68) dialog: I'm gonna punch you in the kidneys if you don't let me finish a sentence.
23) 71) dialog: If this is right, why isn't everybody doing it? In fact, why isn't anybody doing it?
23) 73) dialog: Make this story less boring as soon as you can. 41. 41.
23) 77) dialog: And he was vilified?
23) 80) dialog: 
27) 3) dialog: Nervous?
27) 5) dialog: Huh. Interesting.
28) 2) dialog: Hey, Art.
28) 6) dialog: I got a lot to do.
28) 13) dialog: That's Peter.
28) 16) dialog: Sure you can. 43. 43.
28) 21) dialog: I've got to put a team on the field, then I'll deal with your contract.
28) 25) dialog: At the moment, if a ground ball is hit to first base, nobody's going to be there to stop it from rolling.
28) 29) dialog: I know. I been there.
28) 33) dialog: If you lose the last one of the season nobody gives a shit about the others.
28) 36) dialog: It's on me, Art!
29) 3) dialog: It was cold.
29) 8) dialog: We got Chad Bradford. Right-hander.
29) 12) dialog: That's the one. Technically an underhander.
29) 15) dialog: Unimpressive.
29) 20) dialog: Doesn't have one.
29) 23) dialog: Well, he gets people out. 45. 45.
29) 30) dialog: Let's move on.
29) 35) dialog: Knock me down.
29) 39) dialog: None of them. Grady looks like a man who can't take much more.
29) 41) dialog: You're still looking to replace him; you're just saying it another way.
29) 43) dialog: We can't do it. What we can do is recreate his value to us in the aggregate. 46. 46.
29) 48) dialog: Giambi's on-base percentage was .477. Damon's was .324. And Olmeda's - bless his heart - was .291. Add that up and you get - He points to Peter.
29) 52) dialog: When I point at you, yes.
29) 56) dialog: Divided by three -
29) 59) dialog: That's what we're looking for. And that's what we'll find. Three players whose average OBP is -
29) 63) dialog: You gotta carry the one.
29) 66) dialog: It's right. The others aren't sure what confuses them more - the logic, or the guy who shouldn't be in this room.
29) 70) dialog: Yes. 47. 47.
29) 75) dialog: That's Peter. And that's all he's going to tell them about Peter.
29) 79) dialog: Yes.
29) 81) dialog: You can call it Billy Beane bullshit for all I care.
29) 83) dialog: So here's who we want. One.
29) 85) dialog: Jason's little brother Jeremy.
29) 92) dialog: His on-base percentage is all we're looking at now and he gets on base an awful lot for someone who only costs $285,000 a year. 48. 48.
29) 97) dialog: David Justice.
29) 106) dialog: That's good.
29) 116) dialog: Scott Hatteberg. 49. 49.
29) 121) dialog: Exactly. Sounds like an Oakland A already. Yes, he's got a little damage in his elbow.
29) 125) dialog: We're not interested in him for his arm anymore than we wanted Giambi for his.
29) 128) dialog: Yes.
29) 131) dialog: I say it's just starting.
29) 135) dialog: That's good news for us. He's cheap.
29) 138) dialog: He can't hit and he can't field, but what can he do?
29) 148) dialog: He can get on base.
29) 152) dialog: He gets on base a lot, Rocco. Do I care if it's a walk or a hit?
29) 157) dialog: Yeah.
29) 160) dialog: You got it.
29) 163) dialog: (cutting him off) Grady, it's not a discussion.
29) 165) dialog: I didn't know God followed baseball.
29) 173) dialog: That's okay, Wash. We won't be victimized by what we see anymore.
29) 177) dialog: I haven't forgotten that, Wash. One of them is going to have to learn.
29) 181) dialog: You're going to have to teach him.
29) 183) dialog: Instruct.
29) 191) dialog: Scott?
29) 194) dialog: It's Billy Beane. Oakland A's.
29) 200) dialog: Can we talk?
29) 202) dialog: You want to invite me in?
29) 205) dialog: I'm outside. I can see you in the window. SCOTT goes to the window and cups his hands against the glass to see outside.
30) 0) text: ELIZABETH is putting out some cookies shaped like stars and bells for the late-night guests: BILLY and RON WASHINGTON.
30) 1) dialog: Thank you, ma'am.
30) 6) dialog: You've played catcher your whole life?
30) 10) dialog: How's the elbow? 53. 53.
30) 15) dialog: Yeah, don't worry about it. You've thrown your last baseball from behind the plate. I want you at first. SCOTT is so thrown by this that all he can do is stare at BILLY. Then at WASHINGTON, who's shrug tells SCOTT "This wasn't my idea."
30) 18) dialog: You're not a catcher anymore. If you were, then mine wouldn't have been the only call you got when your contract expired at midnight.
30) 22) dialog: You're welcome.
30) 26) dialog: You don't know how to play first base.
30) 29) dialog: It's not that hard. Tell him, Wash.
30) 32) dialog: Anything worth doing is. Wash is gonna teach you.
30) 36) dialog: Jason's gone, Scott. 54. 54.
30) 43) dialog: The fans don't run--
30) 49) dialog: The fans love me.
30) 54) dialog: Hello.
30) 59) dialog: Great.
30) 63) dialog: --yeah, I have a daughter.
30) 67) dialog: This is a contract for you to play baseball with the Oakland A's. A copy's on its way to your agent. Discuss it with your wife and let us know. (They get up and Billy calls off) Thanks for the cookies, ma'am. We see ELIZABETH with tears running down her face...then go back to the living room--
30) 70) dialog: (on his way out) Merry Christmas.
31) 3) dialog: Hi.
31) 7) dialog: She home?
32) 5) dialog: Hey Alan.
32) 10) dialog: I'm all set, thanks.
32) 13) dialog: I don't keep count.
32) 18) dialog: 
32) 23) dialog: Fuck `em.
32) 28) dialog: 
32) 33) dialog: New beginnings. Blue horizons.
32) 46) dialog: And Isringhausen.
32) 50) dialog: So where is she?
32) 53) dialog: You bought her a cell phone?
32) 56) dialog: At 12?
32) 59) dialog: It's probably a good idea.
32) 63) dialog: Let's go shopping.
33) 3) dialog: You want one with nylon strings, right? 58. 58.
33) 8) dialog: How about this?
33) 10) dialog: Let's try it out over here.
33) 12) dialog: 
33) 16) dialog: You got good.
33) 20) dialog: That's... that's not the way most 12 year olds play.
33) 23) dialog: Who's Alan?
33) 25) dialog: Oh, yeah. Mom's Alan. What's wrong with the teacher you have now?
33) 28) dialog: Well, you seem to be doing just fine to me. Do you like playing?
33) 33) dialog: That's so great. I'm so happy for you. The most important thing in life is to find something you love and do it well. Do you like your teacher?
33) 35) dialog: Okay, I'll talk to Mom and Alan. Do you like that guitar?
33) 38) dialog: That the one?
33) 41) dialog: Let's get it. Let's get it now.
33) 45) dialog: Merry Christmas.
42) 5) dialog: How'd what go?
42) 8) dialog: He can barely hold a baseball. But he's our guy now. Billy sits.
42) 10) dialog: Who's that?
42) 28) dialog: Yeah.
43) 4) dialog: No?
43) 7) dialog: I don't listen to anyone, you know that.
43) 10) dialog: I'm not joking. 64. 64.
43) 15) dialog: That's what we're doing. That's exactly what we're doing.
43) 18) dialog: A computer doesn't romanticize the sport. Leave that for the fans.
43) 22) dialog: I don't want to hurt you love affair with the game. Just because we've been doing it one way for a hundred and fifty years doesn't mean we've been doing it right. You have any idea how long people thought the sun revolved around the earth? To your eyes it looks like that's what's happening.
43) 27) dialog: Yes. Maybe.
43) 33) dialog: Yes, and I've thought so my whole life. And now we're gonna see if I'm--
43) 37) dialog: I'm not--taking it out on--
43) 41) dialog: No, you're not saying anything to me right now.
43) 47) dialog: Yes.
43) 56) dialog: I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.
43) 60) dialog: Well now maybe.
43) 63) dialog: Eric. You never even played high school ball, right?
43) 65) dialog: Grady's gone. You're the new Head Scout.
43) 68) dialog: Don't try to explain things to scouts. They're not programmed to get it. It's just us.
44) 0) text: Team / JumboTron photos are taken of our new A's. It's clear from the photo Billy didn't hire them to sell jeans.
44) 6) dialog: I don't know, Graham. Will they listen to your insipid radio show?
46) 4) dialog: Well, we didn't pay him for his defense.
46) 7) dialog: That's the way, Hatte. Pickin' Machine.
46) 10) dialog: None of those broke 85. 68. 68.
46) 14) dialog: Chad I have high hopes for. Bradford overthrows his first submarine hand-scraping- the-ground pitch, and the ball sails wide of the catcher. Somebody ducks. Art Howe glances with a long-suffering look to Billy.
46) 15) dialog: It just got away from him.
46) 17) dialog: He's still got it.
47) 2) dialog: It's the first day of week one. There's nothing to judge yet.
47) 6) dialog: It wasn't to Giambi? He's the worst first baseman in baseball. What do you think of him, Wash?
47) 9) dialog: Work with him Wash.
47) 12) dialog: I want to make it work with Hatte, Wash. 69. 69.
47) 16) dialog: A rookie first baseman. It's not the same.
47) 19) dialog: Lists aren't baseball.
47) 22) dialog: Hatteberg will be fine, Art.
49) 15) dialog: Hey Chad.
49) 18) dialog: You're not, what's up?
49) 22) dialog: It's gonna work out well for both of us. 71. 71.
49) 27) dialog: 
49) 32) dialog: Okay.
51) 4) dialog: Hey, great to see you. Thanks for coming out. Got a good box? You want a picture? Sure, let me step in there. Great, big smiles now. Big smiles. Know what I like about opening day? Everyone's even. Thank you. You all enjoy the game.
51) 6) dialog: Hey, how you guys doing. So you won? That's great. What position are you? How's your fastball? 92? Alright, should we get a pic? 72. 72.
52) 0) text: BILLY greeting some VIP's in their field-level seats. Throughout this we'll hear bits of talk radio.
55) 0) text: The CROWD CHEERS as the A's take the field. Billy and Peter are at the edge of the tunnel, watching.
55) 2) dialog: Okay, good.
55) 6) dialog: I don't watch the games.
55) 10) dialog: I don't know what you're miming. 74. 74.
55) 15) dialog: This is my team. And they've taken the field. They're world class athletes who are fighting for their lives and I stand with them. Except not literally so I need you to text me what Art does.
59) 0) text: Where BILLY's bench pressing and CRACK--
62) 0) text: We find Billy and Art in conversation.
62) 2) dialog: Yeah. I should have made you a bigger part of the conversation, I should have had you in the scout meetings from the first day, that way you would have understood this better and that was another mistake, I take full responsibility.
62) 5) dialog: It doesn't matter what moves I make if you don't play the team the way I need them played.
62) 8) dialog: 
62) 10) dialog: Why wasn't Hatteberg at first?
62) 13) dialog: How do you know?
62) 16) dialog: 
62) 21) dialog: He gets on-- 76. 76.
62) 26) dialog: Still keeps us in the plus column and we only need to be 7 over 500.
62) 30) dialog: Yeah, I would have rather seen Chad Bradford in there at the end than Magnante.
62) 33) dialog: I don't care about righty/lefty.
62) 37) dialog: This is about your contract?
62) 40) dialog: I didn't assemble them for you, I assembled them for me.
63) 2) dialog: I want you to go on the road with the team.
63) 4) dialog: That's why I want you to do it.
63) 9) dialog: I don't want to develop personal relationships. I need to trade them, send them down and sometimes cut them. You should learn how to do that by the way.
63) 12) dialog: Yeah, let's practice.
63) 15) dialog: I'm a player, cut me from the roster.
63) 19) dialog: Do it.
63) 23) dialog: Man-up, Yale.
63) 26) dialog: I'm already sitting.
63) 29) dialog: But I am. Keep going.
63) 31) dialog: You got that from Bull Durham?
63) 36) dialog: Hitting a curve ball is the hardest thing there is to do in baseball but go ahead.
63) 40) dialog: You're cutting me?
63) 43) dialog: I just bought a house here.
63) 47) dialog: Well? That's all you have to say? My kids just started at a new school, they made friends.
63) 52) dialog: What the hell are you doing?
63) 55) dialog: I'm me. You're talking about kids and schools and you should've been out of the room three minutes ago.
63) 59) dialog: That makes me feel so good I'm thinking of burning your house down with you in it. These are professional baseball players. You just do it. "Peter, I need to let you go. Jack's office'll handle the paperwork." 79. 79.
63) 64) dialog: Would you rather get one bullet in the head or five in the chest and bleed to death?
63) 68) dialog: Go on the road with the team.
67) 3) dialog: Yeah.
67) 8) dialog: Nope.
67) 11) dialog: Hey, honey... I'm glad to see you.
71) 0) text: Casey sits at the table as Billy scoops ice cream.
71) 1) dialog: Do you want strawberry or vanilla?
71) 5) dialog: Don't tell your mother.
71) 11) dialog: Interesting. Chocolate sauce?
71) 15) dialog: Flight. Yeah, I'd wanna fly. You?
71) 18) dialog: Really? Why?
71) 22) dialog: Why wouldn't you want people to notice you?
71) 25) dialog: Well, I guess you could sneak up on people. Or eavesdrop on their conversations. You could be a spy.
71) 29) dialog: What kind of teacher doesn't let you ask questions?
71) 34) dialog: Wouldn't you miss your friends?
71) 37) dialog: There are always going to be bullies. Try not to let them get to you. But let me know if it's becoming a problem.
71) 40) dialog: Yeah...
71) 43) dialog: I know, it's terrible. Look, I promise I'll quit in November if you promise not to worry about it.
71) 46) dialog: Pinkie swear.
72) 4) dialog: Theoretically?
74) 4) dialog: Alright. Be good.
74) 8) dialog: 
74) 13) dialog: 
74) 18) dialog: Anything. Did we talk about the things you want to talk about, did we have fun?
74) 23) dialog: Okay.
74) 26) dialog: You're doing it right now.
74) 29) dialog: You're worrying about me.
74) 31) dialog: Do I look like I'm worried?
74) 36) dialog: `Cause you're getting on an airplane and those things crash all the time. Will you please stop worrying about your father? You're a kid, I can't have it.
74) 39) dialog: Absolutely.
74) 42) dialog: Great.
74) 45) dialog: I love you. BILLY watches her go off with the attendant, feeling like it was an unsatisfying visit.
74) 48) dialog: 
74) 52) dialog: (to the people looking at him) No no. I'm alright.
75) 0) text: Billy runs the warning track with a small radio that he turns on long enough to follow what's happening, and switches it off again.
83) 1) dialog: Steve.
83) 5) dialog: You remember Peter.
83) 9) dialog: Listen, it's a team of probabilities, and we're gonna need 162 games to tell that tale in a nascent form. It's phase one, we're evolving and we feel confident where we're heading.
83) 12) dialog: 
83) 14) dialog: We're not scared.
83) 17) dialog: Because I believe in what we're doing. I believe the numbers. I believe the record doesn't accurately reflect the team and where we're going to be at the end of the season. Peter and I feel very strongly that we need to stick to the game plan, and you can tell your partners to start booking their tickets to the playoffs.
83) 21) dialog: With all due respect you asked me to build a team with shoelaces and gum wrappers and we've done it.
83) 25) dialog: And it will pay off. Stick with us. Suffer the blows. Listen, life with no money means we're gonna have to suffer a few embarrassments along the way, but we are okay in the end.
83) 36) dialog: 
83) 40) dialog: That'll keep us in the hunt.
83) 46) dialog: Nothing Steve.
83) 48) dialog: Listen, you hired me to do this job and that's where we're going to be.
83) 51) dialog: Well, let's go buy Barry Bonds, then. This is the team we've got and this is the team we'll win with. 90. 90.
83) 55) dialog: It's very clear, Steve. If I put myself in your shoes, I'd spend another 20 million on the team.
83) 59) dialog: I'm just kidding, Steve, I'm just kidding. We've got the team.
83) 63) dialog: 162 games Steve.
83) 65) dialog: I don't need to hope.
85) 3) dialog: We're not gonna lose three at home to the Orioles.
85) 8) dialog: I want Dye in right, Justice DH-ing, Pena on the bench, Hatteberg at first and anyone but Magnante first out of the pen.
85) 12) dialog: That's right. So that you can play Hatteberg.
85) 15) dialog: No, Hatte - as opposed to the guy who gets on base less. Pena getting voted Rookie of the Year and the A's making the playoffs are two entirely different--
85) 18) dialog: Not according to, what do you call `em, facts.
85) 22) dialog: Listen to me--gets on base more than Pena. 25% more.
85) 26) dialog: His fielding doesn't matter.
85) 30) dialog: Not only is that number statistically insignificant but it's also subjective. It measures what someone did against what someone else thought they were supposed to do. 92. 92.
85) 35) dialog: Hatte, not Pena.
86) 0) text: The game plays silently on the TV as Billy lifts weights. Not wanting to watch but not being able not to, he looks at the screen to see Pena trotting out to first base ...
88) 3) dialog: That's the point, you think?
88) 7) dialog: No, the point - as you said - is to win. I don't like sharing the cellar with Texas, do you?
88) 13) dialog: I'm through talking.
89) 0) text: Billy lets himself out and walks down the hall to the locker room - regards Jeremy Giambi -
89) 5) dialog: Getting swept by the Red Sox at home. Having Long lead off the ninth with a triple in a one-run game and not being able to score a runner from first with nobody out, is that fun?
89) 8) dialog: Then what the fuck are you having fun for?!
90) 6) dialog: Yeah?
92) 4) dialog: 
92) 10) dialog: No.
92) 15) dialog: 
92) 20) dialog: I'll be honest, if I don't make it in baseball I don't think I'm going to be able to afford much real estate.
92) 24) dialog: I know what you meant.
92) 28) dialog: 
92) 32) dialog: You're kind of saying it too.
92) 34) dialog: 
92) 35) dialog: Honey...don't you think you should divorce me now while you're young?
93) 0) text: Billy shoves a wad of Copenhagen under his lip as he and Peter walk-and-talk.
93) 1) dialog: Get me Wade.
93) 4) dialog: Get him.
93) 7) dialog: Get him.
94) 0) text: Billy's seated at his desk. Peter reluctantly dials a number from a list, the number across from the Phillies' GM's name. It connects on the speaker.
94) 4) dialog: Ed. Billy. I need some help on defense and I'm willing to trade Jeremy Giambi for it.
94) 8) dialog: (ignoring Peter; to
94) 17) dialog: Cleaning house.
94) 21) dialog: Maybe what?
94) 23) dialog: Hang on. (put the call on
94) 28) dialog: Yes, you do.
94) 31) dialog: (into the phone) He'll be fine, Ed.
94) 34) dialog: I'm not picking your pocket, you're picking mine. Giambi's name alone is worth more than Mabry.
94) 38) dialog: 
94) 41) dialog: Great.
94) 45) dialog: Peter. Rule Number 3: When you get the answer you're looking for - hang up. That's done, and in a minute Pena's going to Detroit.
94) 48) dialog: Art can't put him at first if he's playing for the Tigers and I want Hatte in the lineup tonight.
94) 51) dialog: What am I missing?
94) 55) dialog: Why's that a problem Peter? Beat.
94) 62) dialog: 
94) 67) dialog: He's an all star Dave... (winks at Peter,
94) 72) dialog: Why you worrying about my job?
94) 77) dialog: Well you should be worrying about yours because if this thing we're doing don't work... neither of us have jobs.
94) 81) dialog: In which case I'm a 44 year old guy with a high-school diploma and a daughter who I'd like to be able to put through college one day. (lets it sink in) You're 25 years old with a degree from Yale and a pretty impressive apprenticeship.
94) 86) dialog: What are we talking about then?
94) 88) dialog: Dave.
94) 93) dialog: Yeah. Okay. You gotta tell Pena to pack.
94) 97) dialog: Be a man. 101. 101.
94) 102) dialog: No. I'll do that.
96) 3) dialog: Mind if I have a seat.
96) 5) dialog: You can't start Pena at first tonight, you'll have to start Hatteberg.
96) 8) dialog: The line-up card is definitely yours, I'm just saying you can't start Pena at first.
96) 11) dialog: I don't think so, he plays for the Detroit Tigers now.
96) 16) dialog: Along with German, Hiljus and Jeremy Giambi.
96) 21) dialog: Jeremy, come on in.
96) 24) dialog: This is Ed Wade's number. You know him?
96) 30) dialog: Phillies General Manager. Real nice guy. Give him a call - he's expecting it - say hello - then talk to Futterman about arranging a flight for you.
96) 33) dialog: The flight. To Philadelphia. Billy gets up and shakes his hand.
96) 35) dialog: It's been a real pleasure, Jeremy. I mean that. You're a great ballplayer and great guy.
96) 38) dialog: We're going to miss you.
96) 40) dialog: Adkins is gone, too.
96) 43) dialog: Art? I can do this all day long.
98) 3) dialog: 
98) 7) dialog: Go out and field some grounders. 105. 105.
98) 11) dialog: Everybody, listen up. You may not look like a winning ball team. In fact, you look nothing like a winning ball team. But you are one. So play like one tonight. You'll get further instructions tomorrow.
100) 0) text: BILLY's blackberry buzzes.
100) 2) dialog: Okay.
101) 0) text: Billy talks to Chavez and Ellis. Peter stands nearby.
101) 2) dialog: No more bunts.
101) 5) dialog: A bunt is an out. You're paid to avoid outs, not make them.
101) 8) dialog: A bunt is for pitchers and weak hitters. You're not a pitcher, Chavvie, so what are you saying?
101) 15) dialog: Another thing -- you should see more pitches. We wanna get into their bullpen. Deep into their bullpen. We want to see 100 pitches by the end of the 5th inning. You wanna get your at-bats off their 10th and 11th pitcher.
101) 19) dialog: Pete?
101) 23) dialog: Triple-A Sacramento's only 80 miles away. And there's no flights. (as they look to
102) 0) text: Billy and Peter give advice to Dye and Byrnes.
102) 2) dialog: 75 points.
102) 10) dialog: We want to see more pitches.
102) 19) dialog: And Byrnsie, you're hackin' at everything. You're all squirrely out there. Wait for your pitch, man. This is a war of attrition. There's no clock on this thing. Wait `em out. Let them make the mistakes. And when your enemy's making mistakes -- don't interrupt them.
104) 0) text: BILLY and PETER with a group of players around the card table, post-game.
104) 3) dialog: Yeah, make him work.
104) 6) dialog: Billy's fine. 109. 109.
104) 10) dialog: 
104) 12) dialog: Nah, make it Mr. Beane.
104) 14) dialog: I'm screwin' with you, Haddie.
104) 17) dialog: That's right.
104) 19) dialog: No, I pay you to get on first, not get thrown out at second.
104) 22) dialog: I don't hit on 17 at the blackjack table, but if I did, the odds would be the same.
104) 26) dialog: You just handed them an out. Protect your outs like they're your children. There's no clock on this game. Until the third out, anything can happen. Get on base and let the next guy move you up. Pass the torch, pass the torch. We're like a machine. A run making machine.
106) 1) dialog: Hey, Dave. I've been thinking... I want you to --
106) 4) dialog: Excuse me?
106) 8) dialog: You've never seen a GM who was a player.
106) 10) dialog: Is there a problem?
106) 14) dialog: You're special?
106) 17) dialog: As a matter of fact I'm not paying you 7 million bucks, David. The Yankees are paying half your salary. That's what the New York Yankees think of you.
106) 22) dialog: They're paying you three and a half million dollars to play against them.
106) 27) dialog: You're almost 37, Dave. Almost as old as me. Let's be honest with each other about what we each want. I want to milk the last ounce of baseball you have left in you, and you want to stay in the show. So let's do that. I'm not paying you to be the player you used to be, I'm paying you to be the player you are now. You're smart, you know what's going on here. I need you to set an example for the younger guys. Take a leadership role.
106) 30) dialog: We're cool?
106) 34) dialog: All right. Billy starts to leave, but has one last thought for him -
106) 35) dialog: You know -- the Yankees are coming to town. If it were me -- I'd want to take that three point five and shove it up their ass. But I'm a competitor.
106) 39) dialog: 
109) 3) dialog: Don't do it, Migs.
111) 0) text: BILLY's blackberry buzzes:
111) 2) dialog: Thank you.
113) 7) dialog: I heard 7 in a row. Billy clicks off the TV and it's very quiet. Billy is scrolling down numbers that show trends and comparisons of all of the A's relief pitching.
113) 9) dialog: Can you show me righty-lefty matchups for the division and overall versus Mariners?
113) 12) dialog: Okay.
114) 2) dialog: Voos.
114) 5) dialog: (pointing back down
114) 9) dialog: 
114) 12) dialog: Both sides. (to Hudson, playing
114) 18) dialog: (to the others) You guys stop distracting him.
114) 23) dialog: 
114) 28) dialog: Great at bats. Really. Quality.
115) 5) dialog: How are ya?
115) 9) dialog: I did, and I hope you take it as a show of respect.
115) 14) dialog: You look good.
115) 18) dialog: Absolutely nothing.
115) 22) dialog: But.
115) 24) dialog: Magnante's having some head problems.
115) 28) dialog: Yeah.
115) 31) dialog: He's 37 and he's got three blown saves in two weeks. Everytime he winds up he's thinking he's about to throw the last pitch of his life. So he grips it a little hard.
115) 34) dialog: Sure.
115) 37) dialog: Yes you do. Yes you absolutely do. No question about it. Except not really.
115) 42) dialog: If we have a lead late in the game and they have runners on base, I'd rather not see Magnante out of the bullpen.
115) 44) dialog: That's what you should do. Baseball's a game of situations and you should make the decision when the time comes. Except you should make it now.
115) 47) dialog: Don't bring Magnante out if we've gotta hold a late lead with runners on. He's 37, he's scared shitless of being the guy who blows this winning streak.
115) 50) dialog: I......think the regular amount of myself. Magnante on the other hand, he doesn't think very much of himself at all, and when he tightens up we've got ourselves an adventure. So I'd like to see Chad Bradford out of the pen tonight when we're in, let's say, just to make it easier for you, any situation. Righty/lefty, two outs, no outs, the umpires have decided we're going to finish the game by playing darts, whatever. Bradford's the first guy out of the pen.
115) 55) dialog: I don't think so.
115) 60) dialog: 
116) 0) text: The game plays on TV as BILLY bench presses. The A's are up by three runs in the ninth inning but the Indians have a runner on first.
120) 0) text: Billy lays back on the bench, breathes, then unmutes the T.V. and we hear -
121) 0) text: The FANS are booing as ART makes his way to the mound to take MAGNANTE out. BRADFORD makes his way from the bullpen and takes the ball from ART. ART turns to head back to the dugout but slows as he sees a strange sight: BILLY is standing at the dugout rail.
121) 9) dialog: Just nod a little bit--not too much--like I'm assuring you you didn't just make a calamitous vocational decision.
121) 13) dialog: (ignoring the umpire-- still quietly to
121) 15) dialog: --yeah there it is. We're the lead story on Sports Center now so let me be brief. First of all, that was an awfully costly fuck-you, wouldn't you say? 119. 119.
121) 21) dialog: Second of all, genius, those boos? They're for you. Drink up.
121) 25) dialog: Get me this game back.
125) 4) dialog: I'm good, Voos. Thanks. 120. 120.
126) 2) dialog: Suzanne, get Shapiro on the phone.
126) 6) dialog: Yeah, he's lost faith for the season. I think he's gonna dump him.
126) 13) dialog: Mark. Billy. Let's be honest. A premiere setup man is not going to get you any closer to the playoffs.
126) 17) dialog: He's a luxury you can't afford.
126) 19) dialog: By at least one, you mean one? Who is it?
126) 27) dialog: I'll call you back.
126) 31) dialog: Nothing. (continues to stare
126) 35) dialog: Suzanne -- get me Sabean.
126) 43) dialog: Sabes. Billy. You like Venafro. I can let you have him for almost nothing.
126) 46) dialog: Because I'm amazing.
126) 50) dialog: All I want is a couple of bucks and a sweetener. Throw in, say... 122. 122.
126) 55) dialog: Anderson.
126) 59) dialog: No, you don't. I don't even like him. I don't know why I'm doing this -- but let's do it anyway. Venafro for Michaelson?
126) 61) dialog: Anderson. See, I don't even know his name.
126) 64) dialog: Think about it and call me back.
126) 66) dialog: Get Shapiro back on.
126) 70) dialog: 
126) 75) dialog: You sure about that? I get the impression the market for Rincon is softening. I could be wrong. Call whoever's interested and make sure they're still interested. And call me back.
126) 79) dialog: What about the Mets for Venafro?
126) 82) dialog: Suzanne -- Steve Phillips! Get me Steve Phillips.
126) 85) dialog: Between Bonds, Nen, Kent and Snow, they're never gonna do it.
126) 87) dialog: We just need them to cool on Rincon.
126) 91) dialog: Steve-O. Billy. I hear you're looking for a left-handed reliever. What do you think of Venafro? I can make it quick and easy for you.
126) 94) dialog: No angle.
126) 97) dialog: Hang on a second.
126) 100) dialog: How old?
126) 105) dialog: Twenty-six and in Double-A? Forget it.
126) 108) dialog: Furbush?
126) 112) dialog: Eckerton.
126) 115) dialog: You don't even know who Eckerton is. The phone on Pete's desk rings. Peter answers a second blinking line.
126) 122) dialog: No, he's not hurt. He's fine. This is just a situation for us.
126) 127) dialog: 
126) 134) dialog: Tell him to hold. (to Steve Phillips) Look. Steve. Here's the deal. I'm being straight with you. I'm getting Rincon. It's a done deal. It's done.
126) 138) dialog: No, the Giants want Venafro. And I told them they can have him for Michaelson...
126) 142) dialog: -- but I'd rather deal with you. Because you can give me Eckerton and two hundred and twenty-five thousand cash and the Giants can't. Billy's look to Peter says, Doesn't hurt to ask. As they listen to silence on Phillips' side of the call --
126) 147) dialog: Of course. Think. But whoever calls me back first gets Venafro. He hangs up. Looks for the blinking light that belongs to his owner.

126) 156) dialog: Invisibility or flight?
126) 161) dialog: That's what Casey said. Why?
126) 165) dialog: Why isn't anybody calling? The phone rings.
126) 169) dialog: Great. Lemme talk to my owner. Call you right back.
126) 173) dialog: Why would I call Phillips back? Schott. Tell him I'm on the other line.
126) 179) dialog: Tell him we need two hundred and twenty- five grand for Rincon. 127. 127.
126) 185) dialog: Tell him I'll pay it, but when I sell him next year for twice that, I keep the money.
126) 192) dialog: Great! Shit. What are we forgetting?
126) 195) dialog: Wait, never mind! (beat, then into
126) 198) dialog: We gotta let someone go. It's Mags. It's gotta be Mags.
126) 204) dialog: Art. Billy. The good news is Ricardo Rincon's heading over to the clubhouse. The bad news is you got to tell Mags he threw his last pitch for the Oakland A's last night.
126) 207) dialog: What do you mean, no.
126) 212) dialog: We gotta catch Mags before Rincon comes over.
127) 2) dialog: 
127) 7) dialog: -- I need you to stop getting dressed. Magnante isn't sure he heard right, but the silence tells him he did. Eventually -
127) 13) dialog: I'm sorry for the crap news. I know it hurts.
127) 18) dialog: Thanks. Billy gets up to leave. As he exits, he sees Peter enter with Rincon, standing with his new uniform in his arms, looking like a prison inmate. Oops. Billy joins them.
127) 19) dialog: Hey, Ricardo.
127) 22) dialog: Hola. Hey, I know this must seem a bit sudden, but the Oakland A's have been trying to get you for a long time. You're gonna love it here. The guys are fun.
127) 26) dialog: I don't know if you're gonna pitch tonight. But you're on our team tonight.
127) 29) dialog: Right. So... where you from?
127) 34) dialog: Well, you're a lot closer to home. Why don't you hang out there for five menudos and we'll get you a uniform and everything. (to side room) Hey guys, clear the room, huh? Say hi to Ricardo Rincon. As the other players file out and say hello...
128) 0) text: Billy, Tara and Casey at dinner.
128) 2) dialog: Tara and me were thinking --
128) 7) dialog: Tara and I were thinking about going to Point Reyes to the beach.
128) 11) dialog: And I'll work on my grammar.
128) 15) dialog: What? Where did you hear that, honey?
128) 18) dialog: No, I'm not going to lose my job. Don't go on the internet or watch TV or read the papers or talk to people. 131. 131.
128) 23) dialog: Don't worry. You don't believe me? Ask Tara.
128) 29) dialog: No, honey. Absolutely not. And even if I did, I'm not going anywhere. I told you not to worry about me. People say a lot of crazy things and they don't always know what they're talking about. It's just gossip. Like gossipers at school.
128) 32) dialog: And once you do find out who the authorities are, ignore them at all costs.
128) 35) dialog: Everything's fine, honey. I'm not going anywhere. The only way I would lose my job is if someone was to give me a better one. Don't worry about me, okay? Dad knows what he's doing.
128) 37) dialog: Pinkie swear. 132. 132.
132) 9) dialog: So you're saying if we can get our guys to lay off the first pitch it'll put us in the driver's seat?
132) 12) dialog: That's a problem right there. Terrance jogging to first.
132) 19) dialog: My whole career I only had eighteen walks.
132) 22) dialog: Shut up.
132) 27) dialog: Migs, let's make a deal. I'll pay you fifty bucks for every away fastball you hit to opposite field, but you've gotta pay me fifty for every one of those you pull. 135. 135.
133) 3) dialog: Hey, T. Did your car get egged?
133) 6) dialog: I think I just got an e-mail from the culprit. He said he was tired of paying good money just to watch you jogging around the bases.
133) 9) dialog: I don't know, man. Don't worry about it.
134) 3) dialog: Man, you're not fooling anyone but yourself out there. You're falling further and further behind. In your mind, what's the problem? Mecir mumbles something.
134) 5) dialog: I can't understand you with your hand over your mouth.
134) 8) dialog: Right?
134) 15) dialog: Yup.
135) 0) text: Hatteberg in the clubhouse. Billy enters.
135) 2) dialog: Hey, Scottie. What's on your mind?
135) 5) dialog: 16.5 actually. But as a hitter, you will create 70 runs. 70 runs wins us an awful lot of ball games. I can live with that. Can you live with that?
135) 8) dialog: I'm pulling them out of Pete's, actually.
135) 13) dialog: Like a greeter at the Gap. A guy steps into your office, chat him up. You're well read, you went to college. Have some fun out there. Relax.
135) 16) dialog: Scottie, you deserve to be here.
136) 4) dialog: More information. TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY of all of the changes to the board over the following two weeks.
143) 3) dialog: Don't tell me the score, Peter.
143) 5) dialog: How you doin', leggy.
143) 9) dialog: Sharon?
143) 13) dialog: Yeah.
143) 16) dialog: Hello?
143) 21) dialog: I appreciate that, thanks.
143) 27) dialog: No, I'm on my way to Visalia to see our minor league team. 142. 142.
143) 32) dialog: No, I don't.
143) 34) dialog: I'll talk to you later, sweetheart. I love you.

143) 40) dialog: 
145) 0) text: BILLY emerges from a tunnel to a sight Billy's denied himself for 138 games: The lit-up ballpark with a game in play. From the field, we see Billy finding his place in the seats behind home plate. Peter is already there. 143. 143.
148) 0) text: PEREZ of the Royals singles to center field, bringing Mayne home. Then TUCKER of the Royals doubles to left field. Justice makes an embarrassing fall trying to catch it, and Brown and Perez score. They high-five and pass Billy as they leave the plate, the second time he's seen that, and suddenly the Royals have 5. Reaction shot CLOSE-UPS: Justice, Tejada, Tucker on 2nd, Art Howe, the Royals' dugout, a pitcher's conference with Peterson and Hudson.

164) 10) dialog: Thank me? Thank you. Whatever you put in those Christmas cookies, keep-- ELIZABETH starts to cry--
164) 12) dialog: Whoa. It's okay.
164) 16) dialog: It's alright.
164) 19) dialog: Well...You never thought that, and that's
164) 27) dialog: Yeah he does know you did.
164) 29) dialog: No. I just know.
164) 35) dialog: Your husband just took a Jason Grimsley two-seam fastball and parked it in the upper deck in left field for a pinch-hit walk-off home run in a record breaking game. Go tell him about it. ELIZABETH looks at him a moment...and then starts crying
164) 37) dialog: No it's okay now, just go.
164) 39) dialog: Gilligan.
165) 3) dialog: Aw, man. I spend the season trying to reduce it to numbers and we won on romance. Suddenly it's the Natural with Hatteberg. Scott Hatteberg.
165) 8) dialog: She showed up afterwards.
165) 12) dialog: I was a big moment for them. You know everyone wrote him off?
165) 17) dialog: I know. It was beautiful. But you know... it's not gonna mean a thing.
165) 19) dialog: Here's the thing -- we changed the game. We got this year, maybe next, then they're gonna catch on. This is our moment. I want to go the distance. I wanna shove it up the Yankees' ass. Not just the Yankees, but... these guys deserve it.
165) 21) dialog: That's right, it's just a record. It gets buried in some book. Come on, tell me who won 19? I don't even know. It's 4th place at the Olympics. Any other team wins the World Series this year... great. We're still in the record books. But if we win, we've changed the game. We've put it on its head and shoved it up their ass. If we don't, they're gonna erase us.
174) 5) dialog: I've been scouted since I was 15. 153. 153.
174) 10) dialog: I'm not a baseball player.
175) 2) dialog: Ready to do this? Pete nods. Billy calls out --
175) 4) dialog: Suzanne? Get Schott on.
175) 7) dialog: We need to talk about the Red Sox.
175) 11) dialog: Yes. But I haven't spoken with him yet.
175) 15) dialog: I want your blessing before I do.
175) 19) dialog: I know that, Steve, but I'd like to talk to them. I want to see what they have to say.
175) 23) dialog: Yes. With your permission. 154. 154.
175) 28) dialog: Pete?
175) 31) dialog: Well, I think you'll agree this is a great opportunity for him. I can't believe he's not going to make a deal. Peter is frozen. Neither Steve nor Billy are acting like he's even in the room.
175) 35) dialog: I haven't asked to get out of my contract, Steve, I just asked if I could talk to them.
175) 39) dialog: Then talk to Peter.
175) 47) dialog: I think you should think about staying. You're one of the architects of this thing, it belongs as much to you as it does to me.
175) 51) dialog: How you doing Pete?
175) 55) dialog: Why don't you take the day off.
177) 7) dialog: Yes it is. It is.
177) 18) dialog: No.
177) 23) dialog: I don't know.
177) 27) dialog: I think that's James Taylor and I'm certain those aren't the words.
177) 30) dialog: We've got free soda. 157. 157.
178) 3) dialog: 
178) 7) dialog: No I meant something that women wear with, you know, a decorative --
178) 11) dialog: John, no disrespect, I just lost in five for the second year in a row -- give her a bowling ball for all I care.
178) 13) dialog: Yes he is.
178) 17) dialog: You're the Red Sox, and I think I can help you.
178) 22) dialog: I think I can do something about the Curse of the Bambino. I heard you hired Bill James.
178) 26) dialog: Because baseball hates him.
178) 29) dialog: That must be nice. (beat, then) I was grateful to get your call.
178) 34) dialog: Yeah.
178) 42) dialog: What's this?
180) 0) text: Billy comes into the locker room and gives it a look.
181) 4) dialog: Jesus. What the hell --
181) 7) dialog: What the hell was that?
181) 11) dialog: Impressive.
181) 16) dialog: Why would I ever do that?
181) 20) dialog: Oh, what is that, your GM voice? You can't have him.
181) 23) dialog: You already have my job. What else do you want from me?
181) 27) dialog: Why did you take it?
181) 30) dialog: It doesn't matter.
181) 34) dialog: It was fine.
181) 37) dialog: It doesn't matter.
181) 43) dialog: 
181) 47) dialog: So why am I doing this?
181) 50) dialog: I'm not?
181) 53) dialog: The offer says that. The money itself is redundant.
181) 57) dialog: I haven't decided.
181) 60) dialog: Look at this place. What a dump.
181) 63) dialog: No Pete, we lost.
181) 68) dialog: I'm not even over last year yet. I don't get over it.
181) 72) dialog: I really can't look at video right now.
182) 2) dialog: Who is it?
182) 10) dialog: 
182) 15) dialog: Please tell me he's safe at second.
182) 22) dialog: What is that?
182) 26) dialog: Why's he laughing? I'm gonna fire that guy, why the hell is he --
182) 33) dialog: How can anybody not be romantic about baseball? 164. 164.
182) 39) dialog: I know it was a metaphor.
182) 43) dialog: The Island of Misfit Toys. Okay.
