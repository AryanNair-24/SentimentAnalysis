16) 4) dialog: Hi.
16) 7) dialog: My name is Peter Brand.
16) 11) dialog: I'm special assistant to Mark Shapiro.
16) 16) dialog: Mostly player evaluation right now. 31. 31.
16) 21) dialog: Actually he rarely does.
16) 23) dialog: I don't think he was really listening to me in there per se.
16) 26) dialog: Yeah, I think he was listening to Bruce.
16) 29) dialog: Peter Brand.
16) 35) dialog: I'm not sure what you're asking me.
16) 38) dialog: Huh? Oh Bruce? I told him I like Garcia.
16) 42) dialog: 
16) 48) dialog: He's undervalued. You were smart to go after him.
17) 2) dialog: Maryland.
17) 5) dialog: Yale.
17) 9) dialog: Why?
17) 13) dialog: Economics.
17) 17) dialog: I love baseball.
17) 22) dialog: I work for a different team.
17) 26) dialog: Okay, truthfully, it might not be so easy to explain.
17) 29) dialog: We might not see the game the same way.
17) 32) dialog: You've spent your life in baseball and I don't have a very traditional view of the game.
17) 34) dialog: Baseball thinking is medieval. It's stuck in the Dark Ages. I have a more scientific view of the game.
17) 37) dialog: There is an epidemic failure within the game to understand what's really happening. And it leads people who run major league teams to misjudge their players and mismanage their teams. They're still asking the wrong questions. People who run baseball teams still think in terms of buying players. Sorry to say that.
17) 41) dialog: The goal shouldn't be to buy players, what you want to buy is wins. To buy wins, you buy runs. You're trying to replace Johnny Damon. The Red Sox look at Johnny Damon and they see a star worth seven point five million a year. When I look at Johnny Damon, I see an imperfect understanding of where runs come from.
17) 53) dialog: He's got a good glove. He's a decent leadoff hitter. He steals bases. But he's not worth the seven point five million Boston is paying him. You're lucky to have him off your payroll, it opens all kinds of interesting possibilities.
17) 56) dialog: Yes. These ideas and this approach to the game aren't all new. In fact, some of them have been around for two decades. 35. 35.
17) 60) dialog: That's a much more difficult question than how to win baseball games. Once you begin to pull at that string, your understanding of the world might begin to unravel.
21) 4) dialog: Hello?
21) 7) dialog: What time is it?
21) 10) dialog: What?
21) 13) dialog: You were a good baseball player.
21) 17) dialog: 
21) 22) dialog: Why?
22) 0) text: MONTAGE: Peter pulls into the parking lot for his first day of work, takes in the sight of the colossal, concrete relic that is the Oakland Coliseum. He's just in time to see a paint roller on a long pole laying a white stripe down the middle of Jason Giambi's giant portrait.
23) 4) dialog: Good evening.
23) 8) dialog: Yes.
23) 12) dialog: Yeah.
23) 15) dialog: 
23) 20) dialog: 51, I don't know why I lied just then.
23) 24) dialog: This is the American League West. This year we're going to need to win between 97 and 101 games to make the post season. Here's the number of runs we'll need to score in order to win those games and here's the number of runs we can allow. 39. 39.
23) 29) dialog: Okay.
23) 31) dialog: Yes.
23) 34) dialog: Examine the ways that runs are scored and prevented.
23) 37) dialog: Unspectacular runs are more valuable.
23) 40) dialog: 
23) 44) dialog: We know it for sure.
23) 47) dialog: Forget the fish. In this room is every available player at every level of professional baseball, and somewhere in that group are 25 players that everyone has else has thrown out.
23) 52) dialog: An island of misfit toys. In this room is a championship team that we can afford.
23) 56) dialog: Math isn't a theory.
23) 60) dialog: It's right.
23) 62) dialog: It is right.
23) 66) dialog: It isn't.
23) 70) dialog: Sorry.
23) 72) dialog: Somebody once said, "It's not what you don't know that worries me it's what you know for sure that's got me scared." In the mid-19th Century in Budapest there was an incredibly high instance of mothers dying shortly after childbirth from a disease called puerperal fever. 35%.
23) 76) dialog: A doctor named Semmelweiss showed that if the attending physicians and nurses sterilized their hands before delivery, the mortality rate dropped to 1%.
23) 78) dialog: He was institutionalized. For suggesting that washing your hands before putting them inside someone else's body was a good idea. High functioning people can live under the spell of an inexplicable mental lapse when they think as a group. Why isn't anybody else doing it? Because they don't think guys who look like you are what win baseball games. They know it for sure.
24) 0) text: Peter schleps his computer stuff. Sets up, plugs in, fires up. Turns an unused room into a war room with dry erase boards and computers. He installs software in the video room computer, works on a computer in his room, prints two pages of data and reviews.
27) 4) dialog: No??
29) 50) dialog: You want me to speak?
29) 54) dialog: Ten-ninety-two.
29) 58) dialog: Three-sixty-four.
29) 60) dialog: Three-sixty-four.
29) 113) dialog: He gets on base.
29) 153) dialog: You do not.
42) 3) dialog: How'd it go?
42) 6) dialog: Hatteberg.
42) 12) dialog: That is Kevin Youkilis. This is the guy we want more than anyone else in the world.
42) 15) dialog: He can't run, throw or field. But he walks more than anyone in baseball except Barry Bonds. Take out intentional walks and it's more than Bonds. He's the Greek God of Walks.
42) 19) dialog: I tried to get Shapiro to draft him last June. He said he waddled like a duck. Boston took him. Boston won't let him go yet. They're going to wait and see.
42) 22) dialog: You all right, Billy?
55) 0) text: The CROWD CHEERS as the A's take the field. Billy and Peter are at the edge of the tunnel, watching.
55) 4) dialog: Why?
55) 8) dialog: Is this a joke?
55) 13) dialog: I'm miming "You don't watch the games?!"
63) 3) dialog: You don't go on the road with the team.
63) 6) dialog: Why don't you? 77. 77.
63) 10) dialog: The only way I'd have to cut a player is if you oh come on!
63) 14) dialog: No.
63) 17) dialog: No.
63) 21) dialog: This is stupid.
63) 25) dialog: Fine. Billy, would you have a seat for a moment, I need to talk to you.
63) 27) dialog: I was pretending you weren't sitting.
63) 30) dialog: This is the hardest thing there is to do in baseball.
63) 33) dialog: Yeah. 78. 78.
63) 38) dialog: You've been a huge part of this team but decisions have to be made that are best for the team, I'm sure you can understand that.
63) 42) dialog: I'm really sorry.
63) 44) dialog: 
63) 49) dialog: That's--I'd leave them in school, you don't want to take them out in the middle
63) 53) dialog: Are you you or the player?
63) 57) dialog: Shouldn't I tell them that they'll always be a part of the A's family?
63) 62) dialog: That's it?
63) 66) dialog: Those are my only choices?
64) 4) dialog: He doesn't like to mingle with the players.
64) 12) dialog: Billy likes to keep the money on the field.
64) 19) dialog: 
68) 2) dialog: It's not a big enough sample yet. I want to wait until we play more games.
72) 1) dialog: Theoretically, when we've played more games the numbers will become more
81) 0) text: Peter erases the percentage of games left they need to win and writes in a higher number and
83) 38) dialog: Our goal and our expectation by the All Star break is to be within seven games of first place.
83) 42) dialog: And that would be this working exceptionally well.
90) 12) dialog: Cruz -- .283, .347, .476. Stevens -- .244, .349, .560. Miner -- .272, .349, .499. Hanson -- .280, .363, .450. Baretta -- .273, .354, .497. Durazo -- .292, .395, .621. What do you think?
90) 17) dialog: You okay?
93) 0) text: Billy shoves a wad of Copenhagen under his lip as he and Peter walk-and-talk.
93) 3) dialog: Why.
93) 6) dialog: Why.
94) 0) text: Billy's seated at his desk. Peter reluctantly dials a number from a list, the number across from the Phillies' GM's name. It connects on the speaker.
94) 6) dialog: No, you (aren't) -
94) 14) dialog: What are you doing? Jeremy's doing
94) 26) dialog: I don't know.
94) 29) dialog: Runs hot and cold, Billy. Impossible to know what we're going to get. He's a crap shoot. He's exactly the kind of player we're not looking for.
94) 44) dialog: I think he was going to say something else.
94) 47) dialog: I don't think you want to do that.
94) 50) dialog: Maybe you should think about this. You're upset and this is - this -
94) 53) dialog: It's just a very hard move to explain. People are going to think you've lost your mind.
94) 56) dialog: Don't make an emotional decision Billy.
94) 66) dialog: (not eager to help but...) Probably an all star.
94) 70) dialog: (trying to slow it
94) 74) dialog: 
94) 78) dialog: That's probably true. 100. 100.
94) 85) dialog: It's close Billy but theoretically Hatteberg.
94) 91) dialog: That was thoughtful.
94) 95) dialog: You want me to tell Pena he's been traded?
94) 100) dialog: What about Jeremy? Am I telling him, too.
95) 0) text: Peter walks into the locker room. Sees Pena talking to a couple of other players. He approaches Pena.
95) 1) dialog: Hey, Carlos.
95) 4) dialog: Can I get a moment with you?
95) 8) dialog: Okay, maybe we can talk over here.
95) 10) dialog: Have a seat. They sit.
95) 12) dialog: So, um, Carlos, you've been traded to the Tigers. This is the number of Jay Palmer, their travel secretary. He's expecting your call. He'll help you arrange travel to Detroit.
95) 16) dialog: Yeah.
96) 48) dialog: I'm not looking at anything.
96) 51) dialog: 
101) 0) text: Billy talks to Chavez and Ellis. Peter stands nearby.
101) 21) dialog: At least once every ten at bats.
101) 24) dialog: Don't look at him. Here's the deal. I'm not interested in what you think you know about baseball, or what you think I don't know about it. I'm not interested in guts or heart or determination or anything else the fans or your mothers love about you. I'm interested in you getting on base. If you do that, we win. If you don't, we lose. And I hate to lose. I hate to lose more than I need to win. There's a difference.
102) 0) text: Billy and Peter give advice to Dye and Byrnes.
102) 1) dialog: Every at bat is like a hand of blackjack. Every card that's dealt, your odds completely change. For instance, every first pitch strike, your batting average goes down about 75 points.
102) 3) dialog: 75 points. Every first pitch ball, it goes up about the same amount. So you gotta lay off the first pitch. 107. 107.
102) 8) dialog: First pitch period. When you swing at the first pitch you're batting .140.
102) 14) dialog: Every starter, we want to see 100 pitches by the 5th inning.
102) 17) dialog: Yeah. I mean, Hatteberg drained 38 pitches.
103) 2) dialog: Basically, these are all your at bats. This is you versus righties, you versus lefties... and then, of course, all your count knowledge, okay? In an 0-0 count you're batting .290. In an 0-1 you average .238. In a 0-2, .159. When you're 1-0, you're batting .324. Understand what I'm saying?
103) 5) dialog: I know, it's a lot of math. When your first pitch is a strike, your batting average goes down about 70 points.
103) 10) dialog: When it's a ball, it goes up about 30. If you draw a ball on your first pitch, you're unstoppable. If you strike on the first pitch, you might as well be jumping off cliff. I'm trying to get you to lay off the first pitch.
103) 14) dialog: And that's the way you've been trained. But it's a habit we'd like to break you from. We're trying to design the game to your strengths. This has nothing to do with you being a great hitter -- you're a great hitter. We just want to get you on base.
103) 18) dialog: I'm not worried about you crushing the ball out of the park. I just want you to lay off anything that will result in a strike.
103) 21) dialog: Absolutely. The video room is open to you any time, I'm always available.
104) 0) text: BILLY and PETER with a group of players around the card table, post-game.
104) 2) dialog: -- But seriously. Make him use up all his bullets.
104) 23) dialog: You've actually gotten caught 6 out of 17 tries this season.
113) 5) dialog: Did you hear that?
126) 4) dialog: Are you thinking Rincon?
126) 8) dialog: Hardcore.
126) 24) dialog: 
126) 29) dialog: What do you think we can get for Magnante?
126) 33) dialog: Two-seventy-five.
126) 38) dialog: Us.
126) 54) dialog: Anderson.
126) 60) dialog: Anderson.
126) 81) dialog: You just offered him to the Giants.
126) 86) dialog: Totally agree.
126) 99) dialog: Bennett maybe?
126) 102) dialog: Twenty-six. 124. 124.
126) 107) dialog: Duncan? No. Cerda? No. Furbush?
126) 110) dialog: Eckerton? Eckerton. Eckerton, that's the guy. Billy punches the phone off hold.
126) 117) dialog: Hello?
126) 120) dialog: Oh, hi.
126) 123) dialog: It's Steve.
126) 132) dialog: Steve Schott.
126) 139) dialog: 
126) 144) dialog: Yes, I understand it's impolite to keep you holding.
126) 149) dialog: He hung up.
126) 153) dialog: What? 126. 126.
126) 158) dialog: 
126) 163) dialog: You'd have total access. Besides, everyone else would choose flight.
126) 172) dialog: Phillips or Schott?
126) 175) dialog: Right.
126) 178) dialog: Mr. Schott, it's Peter Brand. Sorry I left you on hold. Billy asked me to call you back. He's on another line.
126) 182) dialog: Billy says he needs two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars for Ricardo Rincon. Please?
126) 186) dialog: Billy says he'll pay for Rincon himself, sell him next year, and keep the profit.
126) 189) dialog: Okay. Thank you.
126) 200) dialog: I call not it. 128. 128.
126) 210) dialog: It's not the phone's fault. Suzanne, we're gonna need a new speakerphone.
127) 23) dialog: Muy divertido.
130) 3) dialog: This is a chart of what you should and shouldn't be swinging at. These circles represent different pitches. Red is hit, blue is out, yellow's missed or foul, green is chased, white taken. This is you versus Conway. What do you see?
130) 7) dialog: The red is where most hits happen. That's where you want to be swinging. You don't want to be swinging at the junk at the top of the strike zone. We'd rather take those strikes, `cause you're not going to hit `em out of the park. And you're good about that, patient.
130) 12) dialog: Right now you're averaging about 4 pitches per at-bat.
130) 15) dialog: Yeah, and that's great. One of the reasons why we love you. You're draining a pitcher's pitches. Now, guys like Bonds and Jason Giambi average a little over 5. That's top tier. Does this chart make sense to you?
130) 18) dialog: Every game. Your instincts are in the right place. This isn't something they teach you in little league. This is something fundamental we're looking for -- how to wear out a pitcher's arm. If you're about to face Conway and wondering what you should and shouldn't swing at, come in here and watch how you're tending. You can click on any one of these pitches and watch it happen. Pretty great, right?
132) 2) dialog: Everybody thinks the first pitch is what's most important, but it's not. It's the first two out of three pitches that matter the most.
132) 7) dialog: The difference between 1-2 and 2-1 is the difference between a scrub and an All Star.
132) 10) dialog: Any sort of extra discipline in the first three pitches will help us.
132) 17) dialog: Hatteberg once had 18 walks in 30 at bats.
132) 21) dialog: Actually... 11.
145) 0) text: BILLY emerges from a tunnel to a sight Billy's denied himself for 138 games: The lit-up ballpark with a game in play. From the field, we see Billy finding his place in the seats behind home plate. Peter is already there. 143. 143.

Justice makes an embarrassing fall trying to catch it, and Brown and Perez score. They high-five and pass Billy as they leave the plate, the second time he's seen that, and suddenly the Royals have 5. Reaction shot CLOSE-UPS: Justice, Tejada, Tucker on 2nd, Art Howe, the Royals' dugout, a pitcher's conference with Peterson and Hudson.

175) 49) dialog: Okay... okay...
175) 53) dialog: I'm a little overwhelmed right now. I think I need to process what's happening.
181) 2) dialog: Heads up!
181) 5) dialog: Sorry.
181) 8) dialog: I don't know. Sorry.
181) 13) dialog: You're giving me Youkilis, Billy. 160. 160.
181) 18) dialog: Come on Billy, Schott's going to want something in exchange for letting you out of your contract and I want Youkilis.
181) 22) dialog: And Cash. And a player to be named later.
181) 25) dialog: I don't want your job.
181) 28) dialog: You didn't leave me much choice.
181) 32) dialog: Did he make you a good offer?
181) 35) dialog: What was it?
181) 40) dialog: He offered to make you the highest paid GM in pro sports. 161. 161.
181) 46) dialog: I don't know. I've never heard you say you did.
181) 49) dialog: You're not doing it for the money.
181) 51) dialog: You're doing it for what the money says. It says what it says to any player who gets big money: that they're worth it.
181) 55) dialog: So you're not going to Boston?
181) 59) dialog: It's all over the news that it's a done deal.
181) 62) dialog: I think you've already won, Billy.
181) 65) dialog: You haven't given yourself time to get over it, it's only been three days. 162. 162.
181) 70) dialog: 
181) 74) dialog: No, come with me.
