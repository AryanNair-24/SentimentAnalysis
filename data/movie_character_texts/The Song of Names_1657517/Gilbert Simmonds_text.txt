Gilbert looks across at his wife. He almost certainly has consulted her about this considerable commitment, an autocratic decision typical of the man. ENID gives nothin back - neither consent nor refusal, approval nor disappro Zygmunt is aware how great a commitment this is. It entai among other things, kosher food, Hebrew lessons, Sabbath observance. If he appears to hesitate, consider where he come from. Zygmunt cannot conceive of a Gentile Polish paterfamilias making such an offer.
