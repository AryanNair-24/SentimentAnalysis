1) 274) dialog: Where did he go in 1952?
1) 276) dialog: (shrugs) Historical curiosity.
1) 587) dialog: Next stage of the ‘Great Quest’? Martin seats himself on the bed.
1) 590) dialog: (raising the book) I used to like pony stories.
1) 592) dialog: Oh, yes. Charismatic genius and all that. Except geniuses aren’t very good at being human.
1) 594) dialog: Then why waste your time on him? Our time.

1) 773) dialog: What’s he risking? No reply from Martin.
1) 774) dialog: This is exactly what your father did. You'll spend every penny we've got, he won’t turn up, you’ll have a stroke, you'll die, he won’t even come to the funeral. Again Martin declines to respond. EXT. KOSHER RESTAURANT, LONDON. NIGHT (A’86) 82
1) 775) text: INT. KOSHER RESTAURANT. NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) (A’86) 83 CAMERA FINDS Martin and Helen at a table set for three, eating breadsticks and drinking mineral water. Waiting. H seems distinctly nervous, looking at her watch.
1) 776) dialog: It’s now ten to eight.
1) 778) dialog: Has he told you the programme yet? Martin shakes his head.
1) 780) dialog: Probably show tunes. Rusty virtuoso plays the best of Broadway. Blue - SON D9.1 (09/20/2018) p.85
1) 782) dialog: You've seen him rehearsing?
1) 784) dialog: Same old audience. Everyone he’s let down before.
1) 786) dialog: Newsflash, Martin. If the illusion’s good enough only the magician can tell it isn’t the real thing.
1) 790) dialog: He’s hungry. He’s been rehearsing silence all day. Dovidl smiles at her over the menu.
1) 795) dialog: That it won’t include “Doh a deer, a female deer.”

1) 800) dialog: It’s a kosher restaurant.
1) 807) dialog: Does it matter? Look at him. He isn’t going to be there. Are you, David? Now Dovidl produces from his pocket and unfolds the 1951 concert programme. Slides it across the table to Martin. Helen cranes to see.
1) 823) dialog: waiting out the last minutes backstage. Martin, like his father before him, is in a state of mounting anxiety verg on panic. Helen seems almost to be relishing what is look increasingly like another Dovidl no-show.

1) 830) dialog: If I had to guess? Thirty thousand feet over our heads. On his way to join a Tibetan monastery.
1) 836) dialog: (grudgingly) He can still play. I’1l give him that.
1) 843) dialog: Is it me, or isn’t he being just a little too compliant? Martin nods his agreement. A similar sense of foreboding gripped him too: a fear that Dovidl’s uncharacteristic compliance so far may have been a magician’s misdirection presaging some outrageous act of rebellion still to come. since the concert’s second half is scheduled to be a solo performance without orchestra, Dovidl will have all the latitude he needs to go rogue. ANGLE ON THE STAGE - being cleared of chairs and music stands.
1) 846) dialog: They exchange a look. Uh-oh. And now, for the first time, we’ll hear David Eli Rapopor solo violin version of The Song of Names, composed in 195 London in fidelity to his vow: a complex, exquisitely harmonized arrangement of the simple sung melody that cha his life. It should be at once unbearably soulful, immediately memorable and technically stunning; a masterwork of nuanc and colour and shadow; a description in music of a People suffering, delivered via the ear to the blood. At first we’ll hear only the single voice of the Gagliano playing the original sung melody... INT. WARSAW ASYLUM. DAY (S’53) 93 .--and then a second violin enters in harmony - playing a variation on the melody - as we see DOVIDL (23) play The of Names for JOZEF WECHSLER (32 here but looking fifty). Outside the room Anna can be seen listening to Dovidl’s playing. EXT. TREBLINKA. DAY (S’53) 94 Yet another variation as the voice of a third violin join the other two while Dovidl “plays for the ashes” in the barren field that covers his family’s bones. IN SHOT, in the background, by the original railway track yet devoid of symbolic representation, Anna waits in her [not the Polski; probably a Trabant]. 95 96 97 Blue - SON D9.1 (09/20/2018) p.93 INT. YOUNG REBBE’S SYNAGOGUE (SYNAGOGUE). DAY (S’51) 95 Finally the trio of violins come together, now heard to c accompaniment as they merge into a single piece, in perfe harmony with the sung melody in the Stoke Newington synagogue. Here we reprise the scene of Dovidl’s epiphany - the Youn Rebbe chanting the names to the same melody, the congrega responding. INT. CONCERT HALL. NIGHT (A’86) 96
1) 850) dialog: Let him go, Martin.
1) 852) dialog: Trust the text. He’s given you permission. Probably the only selfless thing he’s ever done. Martin shaking his head. Refusing to accept it.

1) 857) dialog: That day he didn’t show up? He turns to look at her. She remains staring out of the window.
1) 858) dialog: When you left him, after the rehearsal? Nobody knew where he went? Martin makes no response but recalls it clearly.
1) 859) dialog: I’m where he went. MARTIN’S REACTION There isn’t one; at least nothing discernible. He never k of a romantic liaison between Helen and Dovidl; but neith has he told Helen that he slept with Anna in Poland. This revelation balances the scales. It assuages both his guil and hers and it’s enough to dispel the myth of Dovidl. Helen reaches out and takes his hand.
1) 860) dialog: You're a better man than he was, Martin. You always were. INT. SIMMONDS HOUSE. NIGHT (A’86) 103 Hours later, Helen is sleeping as Martin climbs out of be
