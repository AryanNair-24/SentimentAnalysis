She positions him under the win Haggard and sallow, looking nearer eighty, Jozef is rocki rhythmically to and fro in his wheelchair, as though in mockery of Jewish prayer; his long, once-nimble fingers fiddling compulsively with the buttons of his striped pyjamas.

INT. CONCERT HALL. DAY (A’86) 85 In the dark interior he finds the doors to the rehearsal closed, guarded by a SECURITY MAN. A notice on the door reads: “REHEARSAL IN PROGRESS.

This conce too, according to the posted notices, is a sell-out. INT. CONCERT HALL. NIGHT (A’86) 87 The hallways are so thronged they’re almost impassable as audience makes its way into the hall’s auditorium. As in 1951, notables can be seen in the balcony, anticipating t long-delayed debut of David Eli Rapoport.
1) 832) dialog: Did you think I wasn’t coming? He doesn’t wait for a response but strides on to the stag clamorous applause. He bows to the audience.

The orchestra begins its introduction... ON MARTIN: with the programme in his hand, holding his breath. Nightmare visions of disaster are crowding his br visions of some popular tin-ear monstrosity being played ironical effect. But then his eyes close, his breath is expelled with reli as he hears the opening notes of the Bruch, as advertised

Then nothing. THE AUDIENCE - stunned into a silence of their own. MARTIN - moved beyond the capacity to move. When, seconds later, the audience recovers itself, their applause lifts the roof. Dovidl bows low. Then leaves the stage. There will be no encore. There will be no return. The rest is coda. INT. DRESSING ROOM. NIGHT (A’86) 97 Martin has come with Helen to Dovidl’s dressing room, the door of which stands ajar. They step inside. Nobody here, no sign of occupancy. Just discarded suit over the back of a chair, on its seat the cased Gagliano, and on the violin case- AN ENVELOPE ADDRESSED TO MARTIN. Glittering on the floor inside the threshold are THE SHATTERED REMAINS OF A BLOCK OF ROSIN. Helen's eyes go to the envelope, Martin’s to the scatteri of bright yellow shards. Blue - SON D9.1 (09/20/2018) p.94 DOVIDL’S VOICE (V.O.) My dearest Mottl, you’1ll remember how I was forbidden to say Kaddish for my family until their deaths were confirmed and the anguish this caused me.
