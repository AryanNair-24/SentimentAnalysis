As Dovidl waits for the embarrassed titters to die away w witness for the last time that now-familiar ritual: the l upward sweep of the rosin, the long downward sweep, and finally the blessing of his lips. Setting his bow gently to the Gagliano - the gesture of a lover - Dovidl opens with a single note so pure and mourn so protracted, so tender, that even in this initial strok of the instrument we realize that the first half of the concert wasn’t misdirection at all, it was foreplay. This though they don’t know it yet, is what the audience came Many of them are checking their programmes, puzzled, as i Martin, not to be hearing Bach.
