118) 18) dialog: Edward made his promise a long time  ago, long before he met me. Though  he may... harbour some regret, I  believe he will be happy--in the  knowledge that he did his duty and  kept his word. After all--after all  that is bewitching in the idea of  one's happiness depending entirely  on one person, it is not always  possible. We must accept. Edward  will marry Lucy--and you and I will  go home.
118) 20) text: ELINOR finally explodes. She turns upon MARIANNE almost  savagely.
118) 21) dialog: What do you know of my heart? What  do you know of anything but your own  suffering? For weeks, Marianne, I  have had this pressing on me without  being at liberty to speak of it to a  single creature. It was forced upon  me by the very person whose prior  claims ruined all my hopes. I have  had to endure her exultation again  and again while knowing myself to be  divided from Edward forever.
