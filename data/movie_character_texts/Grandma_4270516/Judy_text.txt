22) 15) dialog: That's debatable. So what is going on?
22) 17) dialog: Come on. What’s going on? Spit it out.
22) 19) dialog: Because you are making me anxious, extremely anxious showing up like this, the two of you, in the middle of the day. (to Sage) What’s going on here? Why aren’t you in school?
22) 21) dialog: Right. (pause) Are you pregnant? (pause) Please don’t tell me you’re fucking pregnant. Sage lowers her head. Starts to cry.

22) 60) dialog: I was right.
22) 62) dialog: So you don’t have any God damn money because you spent all your money on shoes and garbage. So it’s my assumption you went to her - (points at Elle) You went to her to get some money but she doesn’t have any money either so you came here. Am I right? Sage hangs her head.
22) 64) dialog: And what about all those condoms I got you?
22) 66) dialog: You and that rodent?
22) 68) dialog: You can get more, you know. I didn’t make them by hand. I didn’t knit them.

23) 7) dialog: (laughs) I'm scary? (nods to Elle) And she’s not?
23) 9) dialog: No, you came here for money.
23) 11) dialog: Right. Hooray for you. (beat) There were a lot of things I wanted to pay for. Nurses.

23) 14) dialog: (to Sage) I am deeply, deeply disappointed in you, you know that?
23) 16) dialog: I thought you were doing better. I thought you were becoming more responsible. Sage is quiet.

33) 30) dialog: Okay. Guess I’m the bank of Judy.
33) 33) dialog: Come by. (pause) Stay for dinner, if you want. I'’11 order pizza. Judy gets in her car.
