Shimizu appears before the marines, with his hands up, a torn piece of his white undershirt in his hand. The soldiers approach him, shouting at him with their rifles pointed. The Americans surround him. Shimizu falls to his knees. They search him for weapons. Finding none, they let him stand back up. Shimizu makes a motion for water. One of the marines hands him a canteen and Shimizu drinks thirstily. Shimizu’s hands are bound and he is taken to an area where another PRISONER also stands with his hands bound. They look at each other in surprise. The Marines receive an order over their wire.
