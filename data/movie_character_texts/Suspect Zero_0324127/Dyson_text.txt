26) 14) text: (re: locker #3) That one's mine. Mackelway shrugs: "Sorry, it has to be opened." Dyson sig then works the combination. Mackelway waits. Locker #3 is opened. Inside, nothing incriminating: a swe some old junk, two trophies. Dyson eyes him: "See?" Macke nods. Dyson shuts the locker.

27) 0) text: Mackelway climbs under the stairs, crouching down, pushin aside all of the aforementioned junk. He grabs the box. Sure enough, that bucket once held red paint - same color O'Ryan used to cover that wall. There's also a bucket of PAINT here. And some used brushes. Mackelway brings the box into the meager light. We get a INSIDE IT now. So does Dyson. Inside, beneath the paint-buckets, we see a few TV GUIDES yo-yo, a football. Then a BOOK on TRIBAL RITUAL AND TRANC Mackelway grabs it, eyes it. He flips through a few pages - odd images: a TRIBESMAN wi eyes rolling back in his head, strange rites, etc. Mackelway sets the book down. Then, amidst the other mate in this box, he spots a large folded MAP. He grabs it, begins to unfold it. We see that this map's written on, in pen. Cities on it have been CIRCLED. But before we can get a good look at it, Mackelway spots something else, at the bottom of this box, a shocker: A photograph of himself. It takes him a second to realize what he's looking at. Bu there it is, a NEWSPAPER PHOTO, of Agent Thomas Mackelway It is part of a FRONT-PAGE STORY, dated July of this year concerning the trial and release...of Virgil Ray Starkey. on the F.B.I.'s Most-Wanted List... Dyson can't help but notice the picture of Mackelway. Mackelway stares. Suddenly we JUMP BACK IN TIME, NINE MON for a brief, choppy FLASHBACK.

115) 0) text: Mackelway stands in the center of this room, Dyson in the doorway. That SINGER down the hall is at it again, off-ke ever. Tonight it's the "Gilligan's Island" theme-song.
115) 1) dialog: I'll be in my office. Dyson backs away, leaving the door ajar. Now Mackelway is alone - eyeing the tiny bed, sink, windo the leaky ceiling, the bucket, the peeling paint. This ro heaving with energy... He sits on the bed, checks his watch. 9:05 p.m. Opposite this bed is that WALL, re-painted in industrial white, with the hint of a shape underneath. It's what Mackelway's come here to investigate. INTERCUT WITH...
