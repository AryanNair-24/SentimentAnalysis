No one else in here seems to hear it. But O'Ryan shuts his eyes tight, grieving, sobbing...

He has been here before. He has it before. And so has O'Ryan... Mackelway just stares, slack-jawed, as that wheat whips p them. The feeling is so unsettling that for a moment he forgets about Zero, and the rig, and the kid... Everything has just crystallized in a horrible way. He kn that he is going to wind up in that wheat field, somehow, O'Ryan. And O'Ryan will be begging him for mercy. "Please..." O'Ryan guns the Yukon, attempting to cut in front of the Zero swings wide, sending the Yukon into a curb this time That shreds their front tire. ...which means that in one minute this car is going to be undriveable. So if they don't stop Zero from hitting that Interstate - now - Zero will be gone.
