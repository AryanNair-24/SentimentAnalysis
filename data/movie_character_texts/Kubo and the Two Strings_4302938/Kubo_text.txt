Kubo YELLS, and runs at the beast, sword held high. It lunges down at him, fangs bared. Kubo leaps, spinning its head and slashing at its pearly white flesh. The swor connects with a flash of sparks, like metal on metal. The beast recoils, but whether it’s out of pain or surpri is not immediately clear. Kubo is upon it again, a dazzli barrage of blows forcing the monster further back. Gaining the advantage, Kubo lunges with his sword, slicin deep into the creature's vast white eye. The beast ROARS thrashes, its enormous tail decimating a scorched buildin behind it. Furious, the beast twists around and comes at Kubo. He du through a charred doorway and somersaults out of a window the creature bulldozing the entire building behind him. Kubo jumps and weaves as the monster lashes out. Each tim evades its claws or maw, he scores a hit with his sword. The beast relentlessly pursues him through the blackened shells of ruined homes. Despite his agility and tenacity, Kubo is running out of breath. It seems he’s fighting a losing battle. Exhausted, he stumbles, and the beast’s jaws lock down ar his body. The armor buckles and cracks around him, and Ku is spat out, SMASHING through the remains of a wall. Painfully, Kubo crawls back onto his feet, bruised and bloodied. The creature snaps its tail like a whip, coiling around Kubo’s body and pulling him up in front of its terrible f The spiky tip of its tail hooks under the lip of Kubo’s helmet and flips it off his head. Giant tendrils of saliva fly out of its mouth as it hisse

From beneath his robe sleev the two bracelets around his wrist are exposed. His mothe hair and Beetle’s bow string. Kubo’s fingers pause over the top of the sword hilt. And withdraw. And then, as quickly as he can, he deftly begins re-strin his shamisen, using both string and hair. The Moon Beast thunders closer through the woods. Two strings in place, Kubo stares at the empty space wher the final string should go. The Moon Beast appears, and finds Kubo kneeling on the ground, shamisen in hand.
29) 4) dialog: I’m not leaving. He then reaches up and plucks out a hair from his own hea and stretches it across the shamisen. The Moon Beast CACKLES.
29) 5) dialog: For every horrible thing down here there’s something far more beautiful. My mother saw it. So did my father. I see it, even with just one eye. The Moon Beast SNARLS, no longer finding this amusing.

29) 9) dialog: I know why you want my eye. Because without it I can’t look into the eyes of another and see their soul. Their love.
29) 13) dialog: No. It’s in my memories. The most powerful kind of magic there is. Kubo plucks the second string. And now, emerging from behind trees and grave markers, co the surviving villagers. They hold glowing lanterns as th march to take their place alongside Kubo. Kubo plucks the final string, producing a NOTE that echoe endlessly, and the Moon Beast stares down with an express of shock. Yet more figures are joining the ranks of Kubo’ army, but these are glowing with the same otherworldly li that we saw surrounding the blue herons. These are the spirits of the dead. He gestures to his army.
29) 14) dialog: It makes us stronger than you’1ll ever be. These are the memories of those we have loved and lost. And if we hold their stories deep in our hearts, then you will never take them away from us. Kubo stands there defiantly, looking up at the Moon Beast who has clearly heard enough. The beast rears back and strikes down at Kubo like an enormous snake. But as his fanged head lunges at Kubo’s army, it is defle by a field of blue light that has appeared around them, j like the glow that protected Mother’s boat in the prologu The Moon Beast is stunned. Shakes his head. Then he strik again. And again. Each time he is repelled by the field w keeps on growing larger and brighter.
29) 15) dialog: And that really is the least of it. With that, he brings his hand down on his shamisen, STRUM all three strings at once. The blue glow explodes, and everything is swallowed up in blinding white light.

32) 2) dialog: I am very grateful. I have had the chance to meet you both. (MORE )
32) 5) dialog: Hear your wisdom. Feel your kindness. Even eat a meal sitting between you. This was a happy story. (a beat) But...It could still be a whole lot happier. Kubo leans closer to the altar, losing some formality now
32) 6) dialog: And I don’t know exactly what the rules are or how this works. But if there were any way to... y’know. I still need you. So I could say this has been a happy story. Or I could feel it. We could all feel it. And then we could end this story... together. A beat, and then he looks up again in growing wonder as a light spills across his face.
33) 2) text: This wondrous sight is witnessed by three figures standin shadow at the river’s edge. The shortest of the figures l up into the moonlight. It is Kubo, his face still partial hidden in shadow, but we can see he’s wearing a huge smil And now we see why... Standing on either side of him, their hands resting gentl his shoulders are HANZO & MOTHER, young and resplendent. there is a “spirit glow” around them, we can’t quite see in this light. They seem as alive and tangible as Kubo himself. His eye sparkles in the moonlight as he looks up at the h soaring above the sea in the night Sky.
