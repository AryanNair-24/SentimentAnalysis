In the windows of the houses they pass WE SEE the faces o YOUNG GIRLS, watching OUR GIRLS head toward the MOB unafr SUDDENLY, a FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL opens her FRONT DOOR a runs across her lawn to join them. And then from the other side of the street, A SIXTEEN YEA OLD GIRL runs out to join. And then a NINETEEN YEAR OLD. Until it feels like every GIRL in SALEM is joining them. And then a TEENAGE BOY. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. UNTIL LILY, EM, SARAH and BEX are LEADING THEIR OWN MOB. In the distance they can see the MASKED MOB gathered outs of Lily’s house. They grab each others hands and hold them tightly. As they come face to face with the MASKED MOB, we see standing behind them A MOB of almost equal size.
