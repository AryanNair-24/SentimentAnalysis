You try to hit a moving  target at 88 yards through heavy  foliage with this cheap 13-dollar  sucker, the world's worst shoulder  weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two  sets of tests and not one of their  sharpshooters could match Oswald's  performance.  Not one.  And Oswald  was at best a medium shot.  The scope  was defective on it, too.  I mean  this is the whole essence of the  case to me.  The guy couldn't do the  shooting.  Nobody could.  And they  sold this lemon to the American  public.
0) 1283) dialog: That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
0) 1286) dialog: I asked myself the same thing.  Common  sense.  Even if you miss the first  shot, if he accelerates you still  got him for a second shot.  No...  the only reason for waiting to get  him on Elm is you got him in a  triangulated crossfire.  You got him  on a flat low trajectory from the  front at the fence there.
