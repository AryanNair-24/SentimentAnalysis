(Ferrie laughs; pause) I've heard over the years you're  quite a first-rate pilot, Dave.   Legend has it you can get in and out  of any field, no matter how small... (Jim points to the  pictures on his wall) I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you  know.  Flew grasshoppers for the  field artillery in the war.
0) 176) dialog: (holds up his pipe) How could I?  Dave, as you know,  President Kennedy was assassinated  on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey  Oswald was arrested as a suspect and  then was murdered yesterday by a man  named Jack Ruby. (on each name, watching  Ferrie's reaction) We've heard reports that Oswald spent  the summer in New Orleans and we've  been advised you knew Oswald pretty  well.

We were told you  took a trip to Texas shortly after  the assassination of Friday.

I can't believe it.  A police  captain with 30 years experience and  a crowd of Federal agents just had  to know that with no record anything  that Oswald said would be inadmissible  in court.
0) 239) dialog: (rising to dinner) Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever  handled a minor felon like that,  it'd be all over the papers.  I'd  catch hell.  And this is the alleged  murderer of the President?

0) 288) dialog: It's incredible, honey - the whole  thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies  that Lee Oswald was given a Russian  language exam as part of his Marine  training only a few months before he  defects to the Soviet Union.  A  Russian exam!
0) 290) dialog: Honey, in all my years in the service  I never knew a single man who was  given a Russian test.  Oswald was a  radar operator.  He'd have about as  much use for Russian as a cat has  for pajamas.
0) 292) dialog: And then this Colonel tries to make  it sound like nothing.  Oswald did  badly on the test, he says.  "He  only had two more Russian words right  than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me  saying Touchdown here... (points to the dog) ...is not very intelligent because I  beat him three games out of five the  last time we played chess.
0) 294) dialog: Liz, do I have to spell it out for  you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary  soldier.  That was no accident he  was in Russia.  He was probably in  military intelligence.  That's why  he was trained in Russian.

0) 307) dialog: Headed the Chicago office.  When he  retired he became a private eye here.   I used to have lunch with him.  John  Birch Society, Minutemen, slightly  to the right of Attila the Hun.   Used to recruit college students to  infiltrate radical organizations on  campus.  All out of this office.   Now come around here, take a look at  this...
0) 308) text: Back to the Lafayette Square of 1966.  Jim walks Ivon and Bill to the corner, to another entrance to the same build this one with a sign that says "544 Camp Street."
0) 309) dialog: 544 Camp Street.  Same building as  531 Lafayette, right... but different  address and different entrances both  going to the same place - the offices  on the second and third floors.
0) 310) text: Bill studies the present sign: "Crescent City Dental  Laboratory", and gives Jim a puzzled look.
0) 311) dialog: Guess who used this address?
0) 315) dialog: Bull's-eye.  How do we know he was  here?  Cause this office address was  stamped on the pro-Casto leaflets he  was handing out in the summer of '63  down on Canal street.  They were the  same leaflets that were found in his  garage in Dallas.
0) 317) dialog: He was arrested that day for fighting  with some anti-Castro Cubans... but  actually he had contacted them a few  days earlier as an ex-Marine trying  to join the anti-Castro crusade.   When they heard he was now pro-Castro,  they paid him a visit.
0) 322) dialog: There was no real fight and the  arresting Lieutenant later said he  felt it was a staged incident.  In  jail, Oswald asked to talk to Special  Agent John Quigley of the FBI who  showed up immediately.  They have a  private session.  Oswald is released  and Quigley destroys his notes from  the interview.
0) 324) dialog: But the arrest gets him a lot of  publicity and as a result Oswald  appears on a local TV debate that  established his credentials as a  Communist.
0) 329) text: Back in 1966, Jim walks with his two assistants.
0) 331) dialog: Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill?   I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was  ever a Communist... after the arrest,  544 Camp Street never appeared on  the pamphlets again.  Now here's  another one for you:  What would you  say if I told you Lee Oswald had  been trained in the Russian language  when he was a Marine?
0) 333) dialog: Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who  would be running that training?
0) 335) dialog: Take a look across the street.
0) 338) dialog: Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office  of Naval Intelligence - And just by  coincidence, Banister, before he was  FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
0) 341) text: Jim makes a gesture encompassing the whole Square.
0) 342) dialog: Bill, Lou, we're standing in the  heart of the United States  Government's intelligence community  in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there,  the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't  this seem to you a rather strange  place for a Communist to spend his  spare time?
0) 344) dialog: We're going back into the case, Lou -  the murder of the President.  I want  you to take some money from the Fees  and Fines Account and go to Dallas -  talk to some people.  Bill, I want  you to get Oser on the medical, the  autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby  histories, tax records...
0) 346) dialog: No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead  serious.  And we're going to start  by tracking down your anonymous source  from three years ago.  How did you  find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas  that day?
0) 348) dialog: You're not under cross-examination  here, Jack.
0) 350) dialog: Here's my problem, Jack.  You told  me you and Guy were good friends for  a long time?
0) 352) dialog: And he never hit you before?
0) 354) dialog: Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day  of the President's murder - our police  report says he pistol-whipped you  with a .357 Magnum. (Martin's eyes are  fixed on Jim) But the police report says you had  an argument over the phone bill.   Here, take a look at it. (Martin looks at the  report) Now, does a simple argument over  phone bills sound like a believable  explanation to you?
0) 357) text: Bill looks at Jim.
0) 358) dialog: How much more?
0) 360) dialog: Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly,  you know - heart attack, wasn't it?

0) 399) dialog: (to Bill) Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren  Report.  He tried to get Oswald a  lawyer. (to Martin) Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
0) 401) dialog: The assassination, Jack?
0) 403) dialog: Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
0) 405) dialog: Nobody knows what we're talking about,  Jack.
0) 410) dialog: Does that bother you, Bill?  I always  wondered in court why it is because  a woman is a prostitute, she has to  have bad eyesight.
0) 412) dialog: When something's rotten in the land,  Bill, it generally isn't just one  fish, we'll get corroboration...  find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were  a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1  it's an alias.  Start checking around  the Quarter.
0) 414) dialog: The murder of a President, Bill, is  a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I  didn't pick you because of your legal  skill, you know.
0) 416) text: Jim pulls the car over to park.
0) 417) dialog: But because you're a fighter.  I  like a man who isn't scared of bad  odds.
0) 420) dialog: I sure do.  We sang "You're the Cream  in My Coffee."
0) 422) dialog: (to Numa) Make sure we come back here, now.
0) 425) dialog: Been too busy, Paul - an elected man  can't have as much fun as he used  to. (seeing Lou and Al) Welcome back, Lou.  Find out anything  on those hobos?
0) 426) text: Lou's been waiting, excited.  He gives Jim blowups of the five hobo photographs.
0) 428) dialog: I can't say that comes as a surprise  anymore.
0) 432) dialog: Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep  in their clothes - these two look  pretty young.
0) 435) dialog: Who the hell are they, then!  Hi,  Susie, sit down. (to Lou) This could be it.  Let's start looking  for 'em.
0) 438) dialog: (shares the look) We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
0) 441) dialog: Can we find her?
0) 446) dialog: If we go to him our investigation'll  hit the front pages by sunrise.   Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was  just given a new trial.  If he has  something to say, it'll be there.   Susie, what did you find out on  Oswald?
0) 458) dialog: Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
0) 461) dialog: It's a contradiction, Numa, get used  to them.  The only explanation for  the royal treatment is he did give  them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
0) 466) dialog: Don't get sidetracked!  How does he  get back to the States?  That's the  point.  Does he have any problems?
0) 468) dialog: This is a man whose secrets cause us  to change our radar patterns in the  Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted  as a traitor!
0) 470) dialog: But who meets him when he gets off  the boat in New York in June '62?
0) 473) dialog: And Marina?  Does she have a problem  getting out?
0) 475) dialog: Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary  people get blacklisted for leftist  affiliations!  The State Department  did everything short of dispatching  a destroyer to Minks to insure  Oswald's return.  Only intelligence  people can come and go like that.
0) 478) dialog: Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming  back to George Washington's cabinet.
0) 484) dialog: This is the guy that keeps turning  up in colonial countries and each  time something strange happens.   Coup d'etats, presidents overthrown.   He shows up on a "walking tour" of  Guatemala's Cuban invasion camps  just before the Bay of Pigs invasion.   If we don't know he's CIA, let's  circle him very probable - Oswald's  handler.
0) 488) dialog: That's scenery.  Don't get  sidetracked.  This is the man, bottom  line, who nailed Oswald to the Warren  Commission as a potentially violent  man, and linked him to the rifle.
0) 495) dialog: Presumably so he can now exercise  his intellect stacking school texts  at $1.25 an hour.
0) 498) dialog: I wonder about the Williams'.  Just  where did the first description of  Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one  knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's,  but his description came after 1  P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's  been tapping the Williams' and picks  up a call between Bell Helicopter  and Janet's phone, an unidentified  voice saying "We both know who's  responsible."  Who called?  Why's  the Bureau been tapping them?
0) 505) dialog: Yeah, after, they take her to Six  Flags Inn in Arlington, prepare her  for the interviews, teach her how  she should answer - and after two  months and 46 interviews, she has a  nervous breakdown. (flashback) Oswald was no angel, that's clear,  but who was he?
0) 508) dialog: We're saying that when Oswald went  to Russia, he was not a real defector,  that he was an intelligence agent on  some kind of mission for our  government and he remained one till  the day he died, that's what we're  saying.
0) 510) dialog: I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald  didn't even pull the trigger, Bill.   The nitrate test indicates he didn't  even fire a rifle on November 22nd.   And on top of that, they didn't even  bother to check if the rifle had  been fired that day.
0) 512) dialog: It went to the goddamn FBI and they  didn't find a goddamn thing.  It  comes back a week later and one guy  in the Dallas police department  suddenly finds a palm print which  for all I know he could've taken off  Oswald at the morgue.  There's no  chain of evidence, Bill.  And what  about the tow guns actually seen in  the Depository?  One an Enfield  photographed by a newsman and the  other a Mauser, described by Deputy  Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee  Oswald was exactly what he said he  was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at  face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going  with my gut here.  He's got an alias  of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H.  Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's  in a name, right?  In intelligence,  they're assumed to be fake.  A name  is sort of like a postbox number, a  code - several different people can  use the same name, right?  Then why  can't somebody be using Oswald's  name?
0) 515) dialog: To frame him, obviously.  You got to  get in your minds how the hell spooks  think, Bill!  They're not ordinary  crooks.
0) 517) dialog: Unless he or someone else wants him  to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered  the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did.   It was picked up at the post office  early morning when Oswald's time  sheet shows him clocked in at his  job.  Lou, come alive.  These things  are not adding up.
0) 519) dialog: Let's start making some assumptions  about the man.  Why would he leave a  path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's?   This is not a thin trail, gentlemen,  it is a very wide one.  Who found  the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou,  Bill, Susie, I want you to go back  and check all the sightings of Oswald  in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in  the summer and fall of '63 - see if  it's the same guy.
0) 521) dialog: Al, you can't tell a mink from a  coonskin unless you see the fur up  close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't  start reading between the lines here!   Y'all gotta start thinking on a  different level - like the CIA does.   We're through the looking glass.   Here white is black and black is  white.
0) 527) dialog: We're talking about a crime, Bill.   No one is above the law.  Reduce it.   A crime was committed.  Let's get to  work.
0) 550) dialog: Because you keep conning me, Dean.   I read your testimony to the Warren  Commission and...
0) 552) dialog: You tell them the day after the  assassination you were called on the  phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and  asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee  Oswald's layer.
0) 554) dialog: Now that's pretty important, Dean.   You also told the FBI when you met  him, he was six foot two.  Then you  tell the Commission he was five foot  eight.  How the hell did the man  shrink like that, Dean?
0) 558) text: Jim, in present, looking briefly - a pretty girl walking
0) 559) dialog: (remembering) Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but  not half as cute as you, Deano.  You  shoulda tried a legitimate line of  business.
0) 561) dialog: When did you first do business with  this Bertrand?
0) 563) dialog: Street cats?
0) 571) dialog: What was his voice like?
0) 573) dialog: Did he pay?
0) 575) dialog: And Oswald?
0) 577) dialog: So you saw Oswald how many times?
0) 580) dialog: Recall any names?
0) 582) dialog: Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
0) 584) dialog: Then how the hell did you get in the  Warren Commission, Dean?  Except  through the phone records in the  Dallas jail?
0) 586) dialog: Of course there weren't. 'Cause they  disappeared.  And yet the Commission  found you, Dean.
0) 589) dialog: Dean, I think we're having a  communication problem.  I know you  know who Clay Bertrand is.  Now stop  eating that damn crabmeat for a minute  and listen. (gets Dean's attention) I'm aware of our long friendship,  but I want you to know I'm going to  call you in front of a grand jury.   I took nine judges on, Deano, right  here in New Orleans, and I beat 'em  all.  If you lie to the grand jury  as you've been lying to me, I'm going  to charge you with perjury.  Now, am  I communicating with you?
0) 592) text: At a nearby table, a waiter has just poured brandy on Cre Suzettes.  A blue flame hovers in the air as Jim leans fo across the table, speaking deliberately.
0) 593) dialog: Read my lips, Deano.  Either you  dance into the Grand Jury with the  real identity of Clay Bertrand or  your fat behind is going to the  slammer.  Do you dig me?
0) 596) text: Andrews drops his pink napkin in the crabmeat and waddles out.  Jim now feels closer to the truth than ever.

0) 658) dialog: Willie, are you willing to repeat  your statements under sodium  pentothal?  Under the supervision of  a doctor?
0) 660) dialog: You realize the things you're saying,  Willie, are going to be attacked by  a lot of different people.
0) 662) dialog: No one's trying to buy you, Willie.   It's important to know why you're  telling us this.
0) 664) text: As he talks, Jim shares a sickened look with Bill.  Whate truth he may be telling is necessarily compromised by an  attitude that could be destroyed in court.
0) 683) dialog: (in present) ...about as subtle as a cockroach  crawling across a white rug.
0) 691) text: Jim looks at the famous photo... the camera closes in on heavyset man who looks nothing like Oswald.  Liz has come back in and overhears.
0) 693) dialog: The interesting thing is the extent  to which the Warren Commission went  to make him a Communist.  They got  almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of  the report on this Mexico trip and  the picture doesn't even match.  I'm  beginning to think the point of the  Mexican episode was to lay the blame  at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or  someone purporting to be Oswald, had  gotten into Cuba, come back, then  killed the President, the American  public once again would've screamed  for a Cuban invasion...
0) 717) dialog: Goddamn!  They put Oswald together  from Day One!  Like some dummy  corporation in the Bahamas - you  just move him around a board.  Sent  him to Russia, in and out, no passport  problems.  You got the word  "microdots" in his notebook, you got  the Minox camera and the electronic  devices they find in his possessions,  the sealed DIZ201 personnel file.   For all we know, there could be a  dozen Oswalds in different cities,  countries - all of them leaving a  trail of incriminating evidence that  could easily be traced to a scapegoat  after the assassination.  Does the  real Oswald know he's been put  together?  Who knows.  It doesn't  matter, does it?  He's a low level  spy, he doesn't know who he really  works for...

0) 769) dialog: Perhaps a few more details about the  evening will refresh your memory.   Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served  by a uniformed waiter - a colored  man.  He particularly remembers that  you sat at one end and he at the  other - which he found rather unusual  because the table was so long.  Does  that bring back memories of Willie  O'Keefe?

(the Nazi helmet with  a bullet hole on his  desk) I picked that up at the Dachau  concentration camp when we liberated  it in 1945.  It was the most  horrifying sight I've ever seen, Mr.   Miller.  Pyramids of decaying,  stinking bones and skin one on top  of the other.  I don't enjoy looking  at that swastika every day, Mr.  Miller, but I keep it there to remind  me of what can happen when a country  turns from free democratic principles  to Fascism, when a few madmen turn  human beings into digits and millions  sit in silence and do nothing about  it.

(the staff seem  surprised by the  thought) Come on guys, think - that's the  only reason to destroy it, because  if it was any kind of threat, like  Hosty said, they would've kept it  'cause it makes their case against  the "angry lone nut" stronger!   Remember the New Orleans meeting  with Agent Quigley the day he got  busted?
0) 1345) dialog: ...there again Quigley destroyed the  notes of the meeting.  I think we  can raise the possibility that Oswald  not only was an informant but that  he may well have been the original  source for the telex we have dated  November 17 warning of the Kennedy  assassination in Dallas on November  22.

0) 1353) dialog: I have a hunch that from the get go,  Oswald had infiltrated this group,  probably Cubans or right-wing  extremists.  He was at the Book  Depository that day, told to be there  by their handlers, either to prevent  the assassination or to take part in  it.  They coulda told him anything,  either 1) they were going to close  down the plotters that day, or 2)  they were going to fake an attack on  Kennedy to whip up public opinion  against Russia or Cuba and reverse  his policies - it doesn't really  matter what they told him, 'cause he  was under orders, he was a foot  soldier.

0) 1369) dialog: I don't doubt their involvement,  Bill, but at a low level.  Could the  Mob change the parade route, Bill,  or eliminate the protection for the  President?  Could the Mob send Oswald  to Russia and get him back?  Could  the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and  the Dallas Police to make a mess of  the investigation?  Could the Mob  appoint the Warren Commission to  cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck  the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence  the national media to go to sleep?   And since when has the Mob used  anything but .38's for hits, up close?   The Mob wouldn't have the guts or  the power for something of this  magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls,  orders, times, schedules.  This was  a military-style ambush from start  to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon  Johnson waiting in the wings.

0) 1593) dialog: To prove their was a conspiracy  involving Clay Shaw we must prove  there was more than one man involved  in the assassination.  To do that,  we must look at the Zapruder film,  which my office has subpoenaed.  The  American public has not seen that  film because it has been kept locked  in a vault in the Time-Life Building  in New York City for the last five  years.  There is a reason for that.   Watch.

The first viewing is silent exce for the sound of the clanky projector.  It lasts about 25 seconds, and then the lights come on.  The jury is shaken The judge is shaken.  The people in the courtroom murmur. Even Clay Shaw is surprised at what he has seen.  Jim say nothing, letting the truth of it sink in.  Then:
0) 1595) dialog: A picture speaks a thousand words.   Yet sometimes the truth is too simple  for some...  The Warren Commission  thought they had an open and shut  case: three bullets, one assassin -  but two things happened that made it  virtually impossible: 1)the Zapruder  film which you just saw, and 2)the  third wounded man, Jim Tague, who  was nicked by a fragment down by the  Triple Underpass.  The time frame of  5.6 seconds established by the  Zapruder film left no possibility of  a fourth shot from Oswald's rifle,  but the shot or fragment that left a  superficial wound on Tague's cheek  had to come from a bullet that missed  the car entirely.  Now they had two  bullets that hit, and we know one of  them was the fatal head shot.  So a  single bullet remained to account  for all seven wounds in Kennedy and  Connally.  But rather than admit to  a conspiracy or investigate further,  the Commission chose to endorse the  theory put forth by an ambitious  junior counsellor, Arlen Specter.   One of the grossest lies ever forced  on the American people, we've come  to know it as the "magic bullet"  theory.
0) 1596) text: CUT TO a drawing which has been put on a chair for the Ju Jim has also moved Al, acting as J.F.K., into a chair dir behind the larger Numa, acting as Governor Connally.  He  demonstrates with a pointer.
0) 1597) dialog: The magic bullet enters the  President's back, headed downward at  an angle of 17 degrees.  It then  moves upward in order to leave  Kennedy's body from the front of his  neck - his neck wound number two -  where it waits 1.6 seconds, turns  right and continues into Connally's  body at the rear of his right armpit -  wound number three.  Then, the bullet  heads downward at an angle of 27  degrees, shattering Connally's fifth  rib and leaving from the right side  of his chest - wounds four and five.   The bullet continues downward and  then enters Connally's right wrist -  wound number six - shattering the  radius bone.  It then enters his  left thigh - wound number seven -  from which it later falls out and is  found in almost "pristine" condition  on a stretcher in a corridor of  Parkland Hospital. (he shows a mock-up  of the "pristine"  bullet) That's some bullet.  Anyone who's  been in combat can tell you never in  the history of gunfire has there  been a bullet like this. (the court laughs) The Army Wound Ballistics experts at  Edgewood Arsenal fired some comparison  bullets and not one of them looked  anything like this one. (he shows mock-ups of  comparison bullets) Take a look at CE 856, an identical  bullet fired through the wrist of a  human cadaver - just one of the bones  smashed by the magic bullet.  Yet  the government says it can prove  this with some fancy physics in a  nuclear laboratory.  Of course they  can.  Theoretical physics can prove  an elephant can hang from a cliff  with it's tail tied to a daisy, but  use your eyes - your common sense - (he holds the bullet) Seven wounds, skin, bone.  This single  bullet explanation is the foundation  of the Warren Commission's claim of  a lone assassin.  And once you  conclude the magic bullet could not  create all seven of those wounds,  you have to conclude there was a  fourth shot and a second rifleman.   And if there was a second rifleman,  there had to be a conspiracy, which  we believe involved the accused Clay  Shaw.  Fifty-one witnesses, gentlemen  of the jury, thought they heard shots  coming from the Grassy Knoll, which  is to the right and front of the  President.

0) 1688) dialog: Men identifying themselves as Secret  Service Agents were all over the  place.  But who was impersonating  them?
0) 1690) dialog: And where was Lee Oswald?  Probably  in the second floor snack room.   Eddie Piper and William Shelly saw  Oswald eating lunch in the first  floor lunch room around twelve.   Around 12:15, on her way out of the  building to see the motorcade,  secretary Carolyn Arnold saw Oswald  in the second floor snack room, where  he said he went for a Coke...

0) 1697) dialog: Down on the street, Arnold Rowland  was seeing two men in the sixth floor  windows... presumably after Bonnie  Ray Williams finished his lunch and  left.
0) 1699) dialog: Kennedy was running five minutes  late for his appointment with death.   He was due at 12:25.  If Oswald was  the assassin, he was certainly pretty  non-chalant about getting himself  into position.  Later he told Dallas  police he was standing in the second  floor snackroom.  Probably told to  wait there for a phone call by his  handler.  The phones were in the  adjacent and empty second floor  offices, but the call never came.  A  maximum 90 seconds after Kennedy is  shot, patrolman Marrion Baker runs  into Oswald in that second story  lunchroom.
0) 1703) dialog: ...but what the Warren Report would  have us believe is that after firing  3 bolt action shots in 5.6 seconds,  Oswald then leaves three cartridges  neatly side by side in the firing  nest, wipes the rifle clear of  fingerprints, stashes the rifle on  the other side of the loft, sprints  down five flights of stairs, past  witnesses Victoria Adams and Sandra  Styles who never see him, and then  shows up cool and calm on the second  floor in front of Patrolman Baker - all this within a maximum 90 seconds  of the shooting.  Is he out of breath?   According to Baker, absolutely not.
0) 1705) dialog: Assuming he is the sole assassin,  Oswald is now free to escape from  the building.  The longer he delays,  the more chance the building will be  sealed by the police.  Is he guilty?   Does he walk out the nearest  staircase?  No, he buys a Coke and  at a slow pace, spotted by Mrs. Reid  in the second floor office, he strolls  out the more distant front exit,  where the cops start to gather...
0) 1707) dialog: Oddly, considering three shots are  supposed to have come from there,  nobody seals the Depository for ten  more minutes.  Oswald slips out, as  do several other employees.  Of  course, when he realized something  had gone wrong and the President  really had been shot, he knew there  was a problem.  He may even have  known he was the patsy.  An intuition  maybe - the President killed in spite  of his warning.  The phone call that  never came.  Perhaps fear now came  to Lee Oswald.  He wasn't going to  stand around for roll call.
0) 1708) text: Back in the courtroom, Jim continues speaking:
0) 1709) dialog: The story gets pretty confusing now -  more twists in it than a watersnake.   Richard Carr says he saw four men  take off from the Book Depository in  a Rambler that possibly belongs to  Janet Williams.  Deputy Roger Craig  says two men picked up Oswald in the  same Rambler a few minutes later.   Other people say Oswald took a bus  out of there, and then because he  was stuck in traffic, he hopped a  cab to his rooming house in Oak  Cliff...
0) 1711) dialog: ...we must assume he wanted to get  back in touch with his intell team,  probably at a safehouse or at the  Texas Theatre, but how could he be  sure?  He didn't know who to trust  anymore...
0) 1714) dialog: Oswald returns to this rooming house  around 1 P.M., half hour after the  assassination, puts on his jacket,  grabs his .38 revolver, leaves at  1:04... Earlene Roberts, the  housekeeper, says she heard two beeps  on a car horn and two uniformed cops  pulled up to the house while Oswald  was in his room, like it was a signal  or something... Officer Tippit is  shot between 1:10 and 1:15 about a  mile away.  Though no one actually  saw him walking or jogging, the  Government says Oswald covered that  distance.  Incidentally, that walk,  if he did it, is in a straight line  toward Jack Ruby's house.  Giving  the government the benefit of the  doubt, Oswald would have had to jog  a mile in six to eleven minutes and  commit the murder, then reverse  direction and walk 3/5 of a mile to  the Texas Theatre and arrive sometime  before 1:30.  That's some walking.
0) 1716) dialog: It's also a useful conclusion.  After  all, why else would Oswald kill  Officer Tippit, unless he just shot  the President and feared arrest?   Not one credible witness could  identify Oswald as Tippit's killer.
0) 1718) dialog: Domingo Benavides, the closest witness  to the shooting, refused to identify  Oswald as the killer and was never  taken to a lineup.
0) 1720) dialog: Acquilla Clemons saw the killer with  another man and says they went off  in separate directions.  Mrs. Clemons  was never taken to lineup or to the  Warren Commission.  Mr.  Frank Wright,  who saw the killer run away, stated  flatly that the killer was not Lee  Oswald.  Oswald is found with a .38  revolver.  Tippit is killed with a  .38 automatic.  At the scene of the  crime Officer J.M. Poe marks the  shells with his initials to record  the chain of evidence.
0) 1722) dialog: Those initials are not on the three  cartridge cases which the Warren  Commission presents to him.
0) 1724) dialog: Oswald is next seen by shoe salesman  Johnny Brewer lurking along Jefferson  Avenue.  Oswald is scared.  He begins  to realize the full implications of  this thing.  He goes into the Texas  Theatre, possibly his prearranged  meeting point, but though he has $14  in his pocket, he does not buy the  75-cent ticket.  Brewer has the  cashier call the police.
0) 1726) dialog: In response to the cashier's call,  at least thirty officers in a fleet  of patrol cars descend on the movie  theatre.  This has to be the most  remarkable example of police intuition  since the Reichstag fire.  I don't  buy it.  They knew - someone knew -  Oswald was going to be there.  In  fact, as early as 12:44, only 14  minutes after the assassination, the  police radio put out a description  matching Oswald's size and build.   Brewer says the man was wearing a  jacket, but the police say the man  who shot Tippit left his jacket  behind.  Butch Burroughs, theatre  manager, says Oswald bought some  popcorn from him at the time of the  Tippit slaying.  Burroughs and witness  Bernard Haire also said there was an  Oswald look - alike taken from the  theatre.  Perhaps it was he who  sneaked into the theatre just after  1:30.
0) 1728) dialog: In any case, Brewer helpfully leads  the cops into the theatre and from  the stage points Oswald out...
0) 1733) dialog: The cops have their man!  It was  already been decided - in Washington.
0) 1736) dialog: Dr. Best, Himmler's right hand man  in the Gestapo, once said "as long  as the police carries out the will  of the leadership, it is acting  legally."  That mindset allowed for  400 political murders in the Weimar  Republic of 1923 - 32, where the  courts were controlled and the guilty  acquitted.  Oswald must've felt like  Josef K in Kafka's "The Trial".  He  was never told the reason of his  arrest, he does not know the unseen  forces ranging against him, he cries  out his outrage in the police lineup  just like Josef K excoriates the  judge for not being told the charges  against him.  But the state is deaf.   The quarry is caught.  By the time  he is brought from the theatre, a  large crowd is waiting to scream at  him.  By the time he reaches police  headquarters, he is booked for  murdering Tippit...
0) 1738) dialog: No legal counsel is provided.  No  record made of the long questioning.
0) 1746) dialog: By the time the sun rose the next  morning, he is booked for murdering  the President.  The whole country -  fueled by the media - assumes he's  guilty.
0) 1748) dialog: Under the guise of a patriotic  nightclub owner out to spare Jackie  Kennedy from having to testify at a  trial, Jack Ruby is shown into the  underground garage by one of his  inside men on the Dallas Police Force,  and when he's ready Oswald is brought  out like a sacrificial lamb and nicely  disposed of as an enemy of the people.   By early Sunday afternoon, the autopsy  has been completed on him.  Who  grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald?  Buried  in a cheap grave under the name  "Oswald"?  No one.
0) 1750) dialog: Within minutes false statements and  press leaks about Lee Oswald circulate  the globe.
0) 1752) dialog: The Official Legend is created and  the media takes it from there.  The  glitter of official lies and the  epic splendor of the thought-numbing  funeral of J.F.K. confuse the eye  and confound the understanding.   Hitler always said "the bigger the  lie, the more people will believe  it."  Lee Oswald - a crazed, lonely  man who wanted attention and got it  by killing a President, was only the  first in a long line of patsies.  In  later years Bobby Kennedy and Martin  Luther King, men whose commitment to  change and to peace would make them  dangerous to men who are committed  to war, would follow, also killed by  such "lonely, crazed men," who remove  our guilt by making murder a  meaningless act of a loner.  We have  all become Hamlets in our country -  children of a slain father - leader  whose killers still possess the  throne.  The ghost of John F. Kennedy  confronts us with the secret murder  at the heart of the American dream.   He forces on us the appalling  questions:  Of what is our  Constitution made?  What is our  citizenship, and more, our lives  worth?  What is the future of a  democracy where a President can be  assassinated under conspicuously  suspicious circumstances while the  machinery of legal action scarcely  trembles?  How many political murders,  disguised as heart attacks, cancer,  suicides, airplane and car crashes,  drug overdoses will occur before  they are exposed for what they are?
0) 1754) dialog: "Treason doth never prosper," wrote  an English poet, "What's the reason?   For if it prosper, none dare call it  treason."  The generals who sent  Dreyfus to Devils Island were among  the most honorable men in France,  the men who killed Caesar were among  the most honorable men in Rome.  And  the men who killed Kennedy, no doubt,  were honorable men.  I believe we  have reached a time in our country,  similar to what life must've been  like under Hitler in the 30's, except  we don't realize it because Fascism  in our country takes the benign  disguise of liberal democracy.  There  won't be such familiar signs as  swastikas.  We won't build Dachaus  and Auschwitzes.  We're not going to  wake up one morning and suddenly  find ourselves in gray uniforms goose -  stepping off to work ... "Fascism  will come," Huey Long once said. "in  the name of anti-fascism" - it will  come in the name of your security -  they call it "National Security," it  will come with the mass media  manipulating a clever concentration  camp of the mind.  The super state  will provide you tranquility above  the truth, the super state will make  you believe you are living in the  best of all possible worlds, and in  order to do so will rewrite history  as it sees fit.  George Orwell's  Ministry of Truth warned us, "Who  controls the past, controls the  future."

0) 1756) dialog: The American people have yet to see  the Zapruder film.  Why?  The American  people have yet to see the real  photographs and X - rays of the  autopsy.  Why?  There are hundreds  of documents that could help prove  this conspiracy.  Why have they been  withheld or burned by the Government?   Each time my office or you the people  have asked those questions, demanded  crucial evidence, the answer from on  high has been "national security."   What kind of "national security" do  we have when we have been robbed of  our leaders?  Who determines our  "national security"?  What "national  security" permits the removal of  fundamental power from the hands of  the American people and validates  the ascendancy of invisible government  in the United States?  That kind of  "national security," gentlemen of  the jury, is when it smells like it,  feels like it, and looks like it,  you call it what it is - it's Fascism!   I submit to you that what took place  on November 22, 1963 was a coup  d'etat.  Its most direct and tragic  result was a reversal of President  Kennedy's commitment to withdraw  from Vietnam.  War is the biggest  business in America worth $80 billion  a year.  The President was murdered  by a conspiracy planned in advance  at the highest levels of the United  States government and carried out by  fanatical and disciplined Cold  Warriors in the Pentagon and CIA's  covert operations apparatus - among  them Clay Shaw here before you.  It  was a public execution and it was  covered up by like - minded  individuals in the Dallas Police  Department, the Secret Service, the  FBI, and the White House - all the  way up to and including J. Edgar  Hoover and Lyndon Johnson, whom I  consider accomplices after the fact.
0) 1757) text: The camera holds on onlookers shuffling and murmuring.  C Shaw smirks, smoking his cigarette.  The very grandiosity the charge works in his favor.  Jim is falling apart from built - up strain and fatigue.  He looks over at Liz,  gathering his spirit.
0) 1758) dialog: There is a very simple way to  determine if I am being paranoid  here. (laughter) Let's ask the two men who have  profited the most from the  assassination - your former President  Lyndon Baines Johnson and your new  President, Richard Nixon - to release  51 CIA documents pertaining to Lee  Oswald and Jack Ruby, or the secret  CIA memo on Oswald's activities in  Russia that was "destroyed" while  being photocopied.  All these  documents are yours - the people's  property - you pay for it, but because  the government considers you children  who might be too disturbed to face  this reality, because you might lynch  those involved, you cannot see these  documents for another 75 years.  I'm  in my 40's, so I'll have shuffled  off this mortal coil by then, but  I'm already telling my 8 year - old  son to keep himself physically fit  so that one glorious September morning  in 2038 he can walk into the National  Archives and find out what the CIA  and the FBI knew.  They may even  push it back then.  It may become a  generational affair, with questions  passed down from father to son, mother  to daughter, in the manner of the  ancient runic bards.  Someday  somewhere, someone might find out  the damned Truth.  Or we might just  build ourselves a new Government  like the Declaration of Independence  says we should do when the old one  ain't working - maybe a little farther  out West.
0) 1760) dialog: An American naturalist wrote, "a  patriot must always be ready to defend  his country against its government."   Well, I'd hate to be in your shoes  today.  You have a lot to think about.   Going back to when we were children,  I think most of us in this courtroom  thought that justice came into being  automatically, that virtue was its  own reward, that good would triumph  over evil.  But as we get older we  know that this just isn't true.   "The frontier is where a man faces a  fact."  Individual human beings have  to create justice and this is not  easy because truth often presents a  threat to power and we have to fight  power often at great risk to  ourselves.  People like Julia Ann  Mercer, S.M. Holland, Lee Bowers,  Jean Hill, and Willie O'Keefe have  come forward and taken that risk. (he produces a stack  of letters) I have here some $8000 in these  letters sent to my office from all  over the country - quarters, dimes,  dollar bills from housewives,  plumbers, car salesmen, teachers,  invalids ... These are the people  who cannot afford to send money but  do, these are the ones who drive the  cabs, who nurse in the hospitals,  who see their kids go to Vietnam.   Why?  Because they care, because  they want to know the truth - because  they want their country back, because  it belongs to us the people as long  as the people got the guts to fight  for what they believe in!  The truth  is the most important value we have  because if the truth does not endure,  if the Government murders truth, if  you cannot respect the hearts of  these people... (shaking the letters) ...then this is no longer the country  in which we were born in and this is  not the country I want to die in...   And this was never more true than  for John F. Kennedy whose murder was  probably the most terrible moment in  the history of our country.  You the  people, you the jury system, in  sitting in judgement on Clay Shaw,  represent the hope of humanity against  Government power.  In discharging  your duty, in bringing the first  conviction in this house of cards  against Clay Shaw, "Ask not what  your country can do for you, but  what you can do for your country."   Do not forget your young President  who forfeited his life.  Show the  world this is still a government of  the people, for the people, and by  the people.  Nothing as long as you  live will ever be more important. (he stares into the  camera) It's up to you.
