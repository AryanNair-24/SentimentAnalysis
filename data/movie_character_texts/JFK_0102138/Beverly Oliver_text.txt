0) 1202) dialog: Oh yes, I used to go over there a  lot to see Jack and especially my  friend Jada who danced there.  It  was the real swinging spot in town.   Everybody came.  Businessmen,  politicians from Austin, Lyndon  Johnson's friends... Dallas was a  slow town back then.  You chewed  toothpicks, played dominos, spit and  dated policemen.  But Jack's was  exciting.  There were always cops  there.  Jack liked 'em around, but  he used to throw the drunks out  himself, 'cause he was kinda a violent- tempered man... it seemed everybody  in those days knew Jack was with the  Mob.  The cops were "bad" back then -  they'd shake you down for the money  in your pocket.  They put a lotta  people in the cemetery, especially  colored people.

Well, I might not  remember a name, but I always remember  a face.  When I saw him tow weeks  later on the television, I screamed,  "Oh, my God - that's him!  That's  Jack's friend!"  I knew right then  it had something to do with the  Mafia... Well, about a week later,  after she told the newspapers she'd  met this guy Lee with Jack, Jada  disappears off the face of the  Earth...

0) 1212) dialog: I just don't want to become another  statistic like her.  If they can  kill the President, do you think  they're gonna think twice about a  two-bit showgirl like me?
