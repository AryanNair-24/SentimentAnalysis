0) 357) text: Bill looks at Jim.
0) 409) dialog: Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief,  but the man's an obvious alcoholic  with a reputation lower than crocodile  piss.

0) 413) dialog: And the six of us, with almost no  budget and in secret, are going to  solve the case that the Warren  Commission with dozens of support  staff and millions of dollars couldn't  solve.  We can't keep up with the  crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
0) 415) dialog: Gee, thanks boss.
0) 444) dialog: Why not go right to the horse's mouth,  chief?
0) 448) dialog: Maybe there's more to this, Susie.   The CIA's keeping something from our  enemies.
0) 464) dialog: Susie, you're an assistant D.A.,  remember.  Stick to what you can  prove in court.
0) 507) dialog: I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying  here?
0) 509) dialog: And therefore because Oswald pulled  the trigger, the intelligence  community murdered their own commander  in chief.  That's what you're saying!
0) 511) dialog: He had his palm print on the weapon.
0) 514) dialog: But why?
0) 518) dialog: I still have to question what the  legal basis is that supports this,  boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful,  but...

0) 619) dialog: And that's where you met Oswald for  the first time?
0) 629) dialog: Go on, Willie.
0) 664) text: As he talks, Jim shares a sickened look with Bill.  Whate truth he may be telling is necessarily compromised by an  attitude that could be destroyed in court.
0) 707) dialog: Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every  bar, no one wants to talk.
0) 709) dialog: (excited) What's the other name?
0) 711) dialog: (stunned) Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy  who used to run the International  Trade Mart?
0) 713) dialog: So why does he call himself Bertrand?

0) 968) text: Jim is moved.  Bill is not.
0) 969) dialog: That's fine, Numa, but what about  all the people who aren't writing  letters.  They're sitting home reading  all these lies.  I just heard NBC  crew's in town to do a "White Paper" -  not on the Kennedy killing, but on  us.  One of their top guys, Harry  Stoner, is talking to everybody he  can find about you, boss...
0) 972) dialog: Look, this is bigger than all of us.   We can't try a case in this  atmosphere.
0) 979) text: Numa leaves.  Bill indicates he'd like to sit in.  Jim no okay.  Miller pays no attention to Bill.

0) 1020) text: Bill has a strange reaction - a sudden exhalation of brea as if an entire house of cards were collapsing.  He rises but Miller goes first, leaving silently.  Once he's gone, Bill turns wearily to Jim.
0) 1022) dialog: Well, they offered you the carrot,  and you turned it down... you know  what's coming next, don't you, boss?
0) 1056) text: Jim picks several empty, capless medicine bottles on a ta next to the sofa and looks at them.  Lou and Bill come ov with a typed suicide note.
0) 1057) dialog: It's addressed to no one and no  signature.  "To leave this life is,  for me, a sweet prospect.  I find  nothing in it that is desirable and  on the other hand, everything that  is loathsome."
0) 1069) text: Jim's mood darkens, and he heads back into the living roo as Ferrie's corpse is being trundled out the door.  The  sickness is everywhere; an oppressive mood.  Bill comes u
0) 1070) dialog: Found another note, same thing, no  name, no signature.  "When you receive  this, I will be quite dead, so no  answer will be possible.  I offered  you love.  All I got in return in  the end was a kick in the teeth."
0) 1079) dialog: The fact is he's gone, chief, and  so's our case.
0) 1081) dialog: With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe?   A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A  drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend.   Shaw's got respect, the newspaper  editors, the American Bar Association -  they're not...
0) 1085) dialog: Where you going, boss?
0) 1089) dialog: Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're  wasting your time here.  Big Jim  gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
0) 1091) dialog: (laughs) Boss would fry me in hog fat if he  knew... (motions to car)
0) 1093) dialog: (smiles) Yeah, I guess you do.
0) 1095) dialog: Frank, I don't want to hear it.
0) 1097) text: This gets Bill's attention.
0) 1099) dialog: No, I'm not...
0) 1101) text: Bill, taken aback, listens.
0) 1319) dialog: What the hell is going on?  Never  before has an extradition request  from this office been refused.
0) 1327) dialog: Yeah.  They were seen together in  Clinton in early September.  The  Civil Rights Movement was running a  voter registration drive.
0) 1328) dialog: ...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was  working on some arms deal to discredit  the civil rights movement.  No one  really knows what they were doing  there, but everyone sure saw 'em.   They stood out like cottonballs.  I  got whites and blacks saw 'em, but  last time I checked there was nothing  illegal with registering to vote.   We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon  Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall  near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's  tough, boss - no one wants to talk  about Shaw.  He's...
0) 1330) dialog: Keep saying what?
0) 1362) dialog: I don't buy it, chief - why would  the FBI cover it up?  You're talking  the whole FBI here.  A telex that  disappears from every single FBI  office in the country?
0) 1366) dialog: (to Susie) Maybe I have a little more respect  for this country's institutions than  you do, Susie.  You tell me how the  hell you can keep a conspiracy going  between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and  Army Intelligence and who knows what  else, when you know you can't even  keep a secret in this room between  12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the  hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby,  Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw -  maybe he's an agent, I don't know,  but as a covert operator in my book  he's wide open for blackmail 'cause  of his homosexuality.
0) 1368) dialog: So for those reasons, you're going  to trial against Clay Shaw, chief?   Well, you're gonna lose!  We should  be investigating all our Mafia leads  here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello,  Santos Trafficante - I can buy that  a hell of a lot easier than the  Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows  Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa -  Trafficante - Marcello, they hire  some guns and they do Kennedy and  maybe the Government doesn't want to  open up a whole can o'worms there  because it used the Mob to get to  Castro.  Y'know, Castro being  assassinated sounds pretty wild to  John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the  book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to  me.
0) 1370) dialog: Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson  was involved?  The President of the  United States?
0) 1373) dialog: Boss, are you calling the President  a murderer?
0) 1375) dialog: Maybe 'cause there's some rogue  element in the Government!
0) 1376) text: The others in the room groan at the reasoning.  Bill feel embittered, cornered.
0) 1378) dialog: Yeah.
0) 1380) dialog: (he gets up) This is Louisiana, chief.  How the  hell do you know who your daddy is?   'Cause your momma told you so...  You're way out there taking a crap  in the wind, boss, and I for one  ain't going along on this one. (he exits) Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one  of his best men.
