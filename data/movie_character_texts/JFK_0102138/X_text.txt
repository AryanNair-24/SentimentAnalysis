0) 1112) dialog: Everything I'm going to tell you is  classified top secret... (significant look) I was a soldier, Mr. Garrison.  Two  wars.  I was one of those secret  guys in the Pentagon that supplies  the military hardware - the planes,  bullets, rifles - for what we call  "black operations" - "black ops",  assassinations, coup d'etats, rigging  elections, propoganda, psych warfare  and so forth.  World War II - Rumania,  Greece, Yugoslavia, I helped take  the Nazi intelligence apparatus out  to help us fight the Communists.   Italy '48 stealing elections, France  '49 breaking strikes - we overthrew  Quirino in the Philippines, Arbenz  in Guatemala, Mossadegh in Iran.   Vietnam in '54, Indonesia '58, Tibet  '59 we got the Dalai Lama out - we  were good, very good.  Then we got  into the Cuban thing.  Not so good.   Set up all the bases for the invasion  supposed to take place in October  '62.  Khrushchev sent the missiles  to resist the invasion, Kennedy  refused to invade and we were standing  out there with our dicks in the wind.   Lot of pissed-off people, Mr.   Garrison, you understand?  I'll come  to that later... I spent much of  September '63 working on the Kennedy  plan for getting all U.S.  personnel  out of Vietnam by the end of '65.   This plan was one of the strongest  and most important papers issued  from the Kennedy White House.  Our  first 1,000 troops were ordered home  for Christmas.  Tensions were high.   In November '63, one week after the  murder of Vietnamese President Diem  in Saigon, and two weeks before the  assassination of our President...

That was 2 in  the afternoon the next day New Zealand  time, but already the papers had the  entire history of an unknown 24-year- old man, Oswald - a studio picture,  detailed biographical data, Russian  information - and were pretty sure  of the fact he'd killed the President  alone, although it took them four  more hours to charge him with the  murder in Texas.

0) 1118) dialog: Anyway, after I came back I asked  myself why was I, the chief of special  ops, selected to travel to the South  Pole at that time to do a job that  any number of others could have done?   One of my routine duties if I had  been in Washington would've been to  arrange for additional security in  Texas.  The Secret Service is  relatively small, and by custom the  military will augment them.  I checked  it out when I got back and sure  enough, I found out someone had told  the 112th Military Intelligence Group  at 4th Army Headquarters at Fort Sam  Houston to "stand down" that day,  over the protests of the unit  Commander, a Colonel Reich...

0) 1120) dialog: Now this is significant, because it  is standard operating procedure,  especially in a known hostile city  like Dallas, to supplement the Secret  Service.  Even if we had not allowed  the bubbletop to be removed from the  limousine, we'd've put at least 100  to 200 agents on the sidewalks,  without question!  There'd already  been several attempts on de Gaulle's  life in France.  Only a month before  in Dallas UN Ambassador Adlai  Stevenson had been spit on and hit.   We'd have arrived days ahead of time,  studied the route, checked all the  buildings... We never would've allowed all those  wide-open empty windows overlooking  Dealey... never...  We would have  had our own snipers covering the  area.  The moment a window went up  they'd have been on the radio.  We  would've been watching the crowds -  packages, rolled up newspapers, a  coat over an arm, never would have  let a man open an umbrella along the  way - Never would've allowed that  limousine to slow down to 10 miles  per hour, much less take that unusual  curve at Houston and Elm.  You would  have felt an Army presence in the  streets that day, but none of this  happened.  It was a violation of the  most basic protection codes we have.   And it is the best indication of a  massive plot in Dallas.  Who could  have best done that?  People in my  business, Mr. Garrison.  People like  my superior officer could've told  Col. Reich, "Look - we have another  unit coming from so and so providing  security.  You'll stand down."  That  day, in fact, there were some  individual Army Intelligence people  in Dallas and I'm still trying to  figure out who and why.  But they  weren't protecting the client.  One  of them, by the way, was caught in  the Book Depository after police  sealed it off.
0) 1122) dialog: Army Intell had a "Harvey Lee Oswald"  on file, but all those files have  been destroyed.  Many strange things  were happening that day, and Lee  Harvey Oswald had nothing to do with  them.  We had the entire Cabinet on  a trip to the Far East.  We had a  third of a combat division returning  from Germany in the air above the  United States at the time of the  shooting, and at 12:34 P.M., the  entire telephone system went dead in  Washington for a solid hour, and on  the plane back to Washington, word  was radioed from the White House  Situation Room to Lyndon Johnson  that one individual performed the  assassination.  Does that sound like  a bunch of coincidences to you, Mr.  Garrison?  Not for one moment.  The  cabinet was out of the country to  get their perception out of the way.   The troops were in the air for  possible riot control.  The phones  didn't work to keep the wrong stories  from spreading if anything went wrong  with the plan.  Nothing was left to  chance.  I bet you there were even  backup teams and cars on the other  side of the underpass in the event  that Kennedy got through wounded.   They would have moved in with vehicles  like they did with de Gaulle.  He  could not be allowed to escape alive.

Those of us who'd been  in secret ops since the beginning  knew the Warren Commission was  fiction, but there was something...  deeper, uglier.  And I knew Allen  Dulles very well.  I briefed him  many a time in his house.  He was  also General Y's benefactor.  But  for the life of me I still can't  figure out why Dulles was appointed  to investigate Kennedy's death.  The  man who had fired him.  I got out in  '64.  I retired from the U.S. Air  Force.
0) 1126) dialog: (chuckles) That's the real question, isn't it -  "Why?" - the "how" is just "scenery"  for the suckers...  Oswald, Ruby,  Cuba, Mafia, it keeps people guessing  like a parlor game, but it prevents  them from asking the most important  question - Why?  Why was Kennedy  killed?  Who benefitted?  Who has  the power to cover it up?... You  know in '61 right after the Bay of  Pigs - very few people know about  this - I participated in drawing up  National Security Action Memos 55,  56, and 57.  These are crucial  documents, classified top secret,  but basically in them Kennedy  instructs General Lemnitzer, Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs, that from here  on forward...
0) 1128) dialog: ... the Joint Chiefs of Staff would  be wholly responsible for all covert  paramilitary action in peacetime.   This basically ended the reign of  the CIA - "splintered it", as J.F.K.  promised he would, into a "thousand  pieces", - and now was ordering the  military to help.  This was  unprecedented.  I can't tell you the  shock waves this sent along the  corridors of power in Washington.   This and, of course, firing Allen  Dulles, Richard Bissell, and General  Charles Cabell, all of them sacred  cows of Intell since World War II.   You got some very upset people here.
0) 1130) dialog: Kennedy's directives were never really  implemented, because of bureaucratic  resistance, but one of the results  was that the Cuban operation was  turned over to my department as  "Operation Mongoose", which meant  that people like my superior officer,  General Y, took over the Cuban  personnel that were being trained to  invade Cuba - and the bases like the  training camp at Pontchartrain in  your home state that were closed  down by Kennedy... and that's how  the "black ops" people, people like  General Y, ended up taking the rules  of covert warfare they'd used abroad  and brought'em into this country.   Now they had the people, the  equipment, bases and the motivation...  check out an old CIA man, Bill Harvey -  ran something called "Executive  Action", which carried out foreign  assassinations.  Harvey was also  involved with the fake defection  program that got Oswald into Russia.   Check out the Cabell brothers.   Interesting links to this case.
0) 1132) dialog: ...don't underestimate the budget  cuts Kennedy called for in March of  '63 either - close to 52 military  installations in 25 states, 21  overseas bases, you're talking big  money.  You know how many helicopters  have been lost in Vietnam?  About  three thousand so far.  Who makes  them?  Bell Helicopter.  Who owns  Bell?  Bell was near bankruptcy when  the First National Bank of Boston  approached the CIA about developing  the helicopter for Indochina usage.   How 'bout the f-111 fighters?  General  Dynamics in Fort Worth.  Who owns  that?  Find out the defense budget  since the war began.  $75 going on a  hundred billion ... $200 billion'll  be spent before it ends.  In 1950 it  was $13 billion.  No war, no money.   Sometimes I think the organizing  principle of any society is for war.   The authority of the state over it's  people resides in it's war powers.   Even Eisenhower - military hero of  WWII - warned us about it: "beware  the military - industrial complex",  he said.  Kennedy wanted to end the  Cold War in his second term.  He  wanted to call of the moon race in  favor of cooperation with the Soviets.   He signed a treaty with the Soviets  to ban nuclear testing, he refused  to invade Cuba in '62, and he set  out to withdraw from Vietnam.  But  that all ended on November 22, 1963.

0) 1775) dialog: I think it started in the wind.   Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon  people, contractors, bankers,  politicians like L.B.J. were committed  to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early  as '61 they knew Kennedy was going  to change things... He was not going  to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows?   Probably some boardroom or lunchroom  somewhere - Houston, New York - hell,  maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows,  it's international now.
0) 1776) text: CUT TO: a New York lunch club or executive dining room.   From the window we have a towering view of the City.  Fou men in their 50's to 70's - old men, rich men, talk at a  quiet table.  Their figures are shadowy and we overhear t conversation obliquely, across faces flared out by sun  bouncing off the skyscraper window.

It's as  old as the Crucifixion: the Mafia  firing squad, one blank, no one's  guilty because everyone in the Power  Structure who knows anything has a  plausible deniability.  There are no  compromising connections except at  the most secret point.  But what's  paramount is that it must succeed.   No matter how many die, how much it  costs, the perpetrators must be on  the winning side and never subject  to prosecution for anything by anyone.   That is a coup d'etat.

In September,  Kennedy announces the Texas trip.   At that moment, second Oswalds start  popping up all over Dallas where  they have the mayor and the cops in  their pocket.  Y flies in the  assassins, maybe from the special  camp we keep outside Athens, Greece -  pros, maybe some locals, Cubans,  Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it  really matter who shot from what  rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The  assassins by now are dead or well  paid and long gone...
0) 1804) dialog: ...don't think so.  When they start  to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These  guys are proud of what they did.   They did Dealey Plaza!  They took  out the President of the United  States!  That's entertainment!  And  they served their country doing it.

What was he doing  there?  If anyone had asked him,  he'd probably say "protection" but  I'll tell you I think he was giving  some kind of "okay" signal to those  hoboes - they're about to get booked  and he's telling 'em it's gonna be  okay, they're covered.  And in fact  they were - you never heard of them  again.
