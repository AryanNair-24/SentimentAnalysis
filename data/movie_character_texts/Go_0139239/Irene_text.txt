142) 11) dialog: The wine. BURKE Even that cologne you liked. (practiced) See, Confederated Products is a multi- level direct wholesaling company. That means we don't just sell the products ourselves, we also recruit and manage teams who work under us. Irene and I started eight months ago and we're already bringing in fifty thousand a year in revenues. IRENE We're the number four distributor in Southern California. By March, we might be number three.

BURKE Confederated Products. It's a different company, different quality of product.
