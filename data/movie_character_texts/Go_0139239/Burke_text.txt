142) 12) text: She crosses her fingers. So does Burke. We look to Zack, horrified. BURKE Now, as law enforcement officers, Irene and I can't recruit distributors from inside the force. It's against the rules and we'd get fired. So what we do is look for people in other industries... IRENE ...like the entertainment industry. ZACK Wait. (realizing) You want us to sell Amway. BURKE Confederated Products. It's a different company, different quality of product.
