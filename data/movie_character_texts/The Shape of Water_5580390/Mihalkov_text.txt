31) 1) dialog: “Bob.” How are you? The group laughs. Not Hoffstetler. He responds in flat bu fluent, unaccented Russian.
31) 3) dialog: I could change my mind.
31) 5) dialog: But I could- (pours a drink) So- Tell us, “Bob"-
31) 7) dialog: What is this, Dimitri? Sit- sit-
31) 9) dialog: I will pass it on to the directorate. Mihalkov opens a bottle of vodka. Pours.
31) 10) dialog: Distilled four times- arrives by diplomatic valise. Minsk. Isn’t that your hometown?
31) 12) dialog: Communicate.
31) 14) dialog: I will. A WAITER brings three plates of steaming lobster tails an filet mignon and a pot of butter. The Burly Russian eats. MIHALKOV (CONT’D) Now- eat, Dimitri. They call this “Surf—"

43) 10) dialog: I understand. Which brings us up to option two. Takes the “Popper.” MIHALKOV (CONT’D) Israeli “Popper”- you set it next to a fuse box- it will buy you five to ten minutes in the dark: no cameras- no containment doors- Then- Opens the small case. Inside: two syringes full of silver liquid.
43) 11) dialog: You inject it with this-
43) 13) dialog: Kill it. Destroy it- Are you all right?

100) 31) dialog: The asset... when you injected it, how did it react? Hoffstetler serves the cake.
100) 33) dialog: React. See? In humans the poison works instantaneously while for animals there is a delayed reaction. I was curious...
100) 37) dialog: What did you do with the corpus? Hoffstetler readies the knife.
100) 39) dialog: Lenin said that?
