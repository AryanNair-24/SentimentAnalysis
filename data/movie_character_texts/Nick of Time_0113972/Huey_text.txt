37) 14) dialog: What do you do, if I may be so bold?

37) 18) dialog: 
37) 19) dialog: Now you take tips. Time was a tip  was between a man and his customer.  Not any more. They've figured out  what they call a formulae, don't  laugh, it ain't for babies. They  take your sales, see, and slap a  percentile on there, figuring that  somewhere between your lies and your  bad luck they'll hit on the mean  amount, mean meaning "in the middle",  but if you ask me it means "just  plain mean". Why you can have Uncle  Scrooge wring a nickel over your  poor out-stretched palm, or Daddy  Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins  like manna from heaven, don't make  no difference, they'll tax your behind  according to that same figure. Doesn't  seem quite right., does it?

37) 29) dialog: I'll have you out of here in two  shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
37) 31) text: GENE I keep wondering what she would do if she was here.  She'd figure it out. She'd run it down like a column of  numbers. Pro's and cons. That's the way she was: Lists al over the house. HUEY's manic shoe-shining slows down: who has he got in h chair?
37) 33) text: HUEY keeps his eyes on his work. He's afraid he's got a l one.
37) 34) dialog: Yes, well, you know, for a quality  shoe you can't beat a good wingtip.  Wears like iron. You're a wise man.  There ya' go. Two bucks.

66) 5) dialog: (as he looks up) You got a complaint?
66) 8) dialog: I remember. The big tipper.
66) 10) dialog: Oh, man...
66) 12) dialog: What? The end of the world? Man,  don't give me your mad rap. I'm not  a bartender. I don't want to hear  it. I raise a family doing this  bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your  crazy white ass out of my chair.
66) 14) dialog: Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the  right to crap in my ear. You want  change?  You got it, brother. What  was that you gave me, a twenty?
66) 15) text: HUEY kneels down, gets his cashbox, starts to open it up. From behind him:

66) 23) dialog: Why, looky-here. My customer-quotient  just got multiplied by two. What do  you think of that?  You'll have to  forgive me, sir. Didn't hear your  approach. Fact of the matter is, I'm  deef as a post. Compliments of the  United States Army... (does a snappy salute) ...Artillery Corps. Can I give you a  shine, sir? You don't see your face,  you don't pay.
66) 26) text: HUEY goes to work on his shoes.
66) 29) text: Unseen by MR. SMITH, HUEY takes a peek and sees the gun b transferred to GENE's pocket.
