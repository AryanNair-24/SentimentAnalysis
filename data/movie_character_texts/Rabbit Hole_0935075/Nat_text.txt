4) 0) text: Howie and his best friend, RICK, athletic, 30's, are in t midst of an intense game of squash. It's all grunts and thwacks and squeaking sneakers. Howie loses the point. INT. LOCKER ROOM —- MOMENTS LATER Sweaty and spent, the men enter chatting. Their banter is easy and mostly good-natured.
8) 8) dialog: Oh my god, why didn't you tell me you were coming over? I would've picked up the house. (indicates) That’s Auggie.
8) 10) dialog: (her eyes narrow) Oh yeah, she's here. (does not approve) She got fired from the Applebee's. Becca follows her mother into the house.
9) 5) dialog: He has to. His girlfriend kicked him out.
9) 7) dialog: She knew what I meant. Becca holds up a little shirt.
9) 17) dialog: It's probably a girl anyway. I'ma little psychic about these things. Remember I said Sheila was having a girl? And Karen? I think there's a girl in there.
9) 20) dialog: You want some coffee cake, honey? I got some coffee cake in here.
9) 22) dialog: (to Izzy) Here. Eat some cake.
20) 19) dialog: Hello?
21) 2) dialog: What's wrong? 36.
21) 4) dialog: Oh Honey, you don't need to do all that. I was just gonna grab her one of those Carvel things. She likes those.
21) 6) dialog: Okay then. Becca checks the fridge to make sure she has everything s needs.
21) 7) dialog: No group tonight?
21) 9) dialog: Nothing. It’s just...some people find that comforting.
21) 11) dialog: You know, Becca, when your brother died, I found the church very helpful.
21) 13) dialog: I don’t know why you don’t believe in god anyway. I brought you to church every Sunday-- 37.
21) 15) dialog: You’re not right about everything, you know. What if there is a God?
21) 17) dialog: Alright, Becca. That’s enough.
21) 20) dialog: You're gonna do the cake then?
21) 22) dialog: Right, I'll see you tomorrow. Nat hangs up abruptly. INT. HOWIE'S CAR — GOING TO THE PARTY - A LITTLE LATER
21) 57) dialog: Yeah, but that’s not a curse though. That's just bad luck.
21) 59) dialog: Too much money, that's their curse. If those Kennedys lived like normal people, most of them would still be alive.
21) 61) dialog: Of course it’s sad. All those good- looking people falling out of the sky like that. It’s a friggin’ waste.
21) 64) dialog: Isn't this nice? Sitting around talking politics? I never do this. It’s a nice change.
21) 77) dialog: Okay, now me. Nat hands a gift to Izzy...
21) 78) dialog: I know it’s a little early but-- 43. Izzy unwraps maternity clothes. Much warmer response.
21) 81) dialog: No honey, it's not baby stuff, it's mommy stuff.
21) 89) text: SAME — LATER THAT NIGHT Things are much rowdier. Izzy's friends bowl like drunken fools. Becca and Howie with Nat, who’s pretty sloshed.
21) 90) dialog: Oh, I just remembered what I was gonna say about Aristotle Onassis! It was about the son who died in the plane crash! Becca looks at her watch. People bowl.
21) 93) dialog: You should’ve stopped me from going off on that Kennedy stuff, because my point was about Onassis and how he put up a reward to anyone who could prove that someone had sabotaged his son’s plane. He was so desperate to blame somebody. (to Howie) Did you read this? Howie gets up to leave, but Nat keeps talking.
21) 94) dialog: He needed a reason for losing his son.
21) 96) dialog: I'm just talking. I can't talk?
21) 99) dialog: You forget what I went through when your brother died. You think I don't know anything, but I do Becca!
21) 103) dialog: I'm not talking about blame, I'm talking about comfort.
21) 105) dialog: Where are you getting it?
21) 107) dialog: Well I think you should.
21) 109) dialog: I'm just trying to help you, Becca. I wish someone had given me a little advice when Arthur died. Becca turns on her mother and lashes out... 46.
21) 111) dialog: He was still my son. Becca gathers up her things. Howie, looking deeply uncomfortable, helps to usher her out.
21) 114) dialog: When Arthur died, I was just as upset as she was, but I never took it out on other people.
21) 116) dialog: Nobody's talking about Mrs. Bailey!
29) 20) text: Nat is helping Becca clean out Danny's room. Becca is putting Danny's books into a milk crate. Nat is taking to stuffed animals, puzzles, etc., out of a toy box and plac them into a garbage bag, or into a keep-box. Something stops Nat. She's pulled one of Danny's sneakers out of the toy box. It's smaller than she remembers. Becc glances over at her and realizes what's happening.
29) 22) dialog: I don't know how to turn it off. It takes a moment, but Becca switches off the toy.
29) 24) dialog: Have you heard from Debbie yet?
29) 26) dialog: That's too bad. But it can be worse the other way, you know. I remember when Arthur died-- (stops herself) Sorry. Nat bites her tongue and moves away. Becca feels badly.
29) 28) dialog: Can I? I don't know your rules, Becca. I don't wanna get scolded again.
29) 30) dialog: (beat) Okay. A moment passes between them. Over the following, they continue to organize the toys...
29) 32) dialog: You remember Maureen Bailey?
29) 34) dialog: I couldn't get rid of her after your brother passed away. She was always at the house.
29) 36) dialog: Yeah well, I never had a moment to myself. So finally in the middle of coffee one afternoon, I said, "Maureen, why are you always here?"
29) 38) dialog: She said, "I wanna be there, Nat, I wanna share in your grief." And so I said "Well it's not working. You plant your fat ass in that chair every frickin' day--"
29) 40) dialog: I did! "And you suck up all my coffee, and I don't see you leaving with any of this grief you're allegedly sharing with me. In fact the only thing you do take outta here are my cinnamon buns." (beat ) So I never saw her again obviously. Nat shrugs. She gets a genuine chuckle out of Becca.
29) 41) dialog: I feel guilty now.
29) 43) dialog: (laughing) I do. (then) You’re right, I don’t. I don’t miss her at all. 68. EXT. BECCA’s HOME — DAY It is a bright sunny day. Becca’s home has an “open house sign in front of it. EXT. BECCA’S BACKYARD — SAME DAY Taz is back. Howie puts him on a runner in the back yard.
33) 9) dialog: What. 82.
33) 11) dialog: No. I don't think it does. Not for me it hasn't. And that's goin' on eleven years. (beat) It changes though.
33) 13) dialog: I don't know. The weight of it, I guess. At some point it becomes bearable. It turns into something you can crawl out from under, and carry around - like a brick in your pocket. And you forget it every once in a while, but then you reach in for whatever reason and there it is: "Oh right. That." Which can be awful. But not all the time. Sometimes it's kinda... Not that you like it exactly, but it's what you have instead of your son, so you don't wanna let go of it either. So you carry it around. And it doesn't go away, which is...
33) 16) dialog: Fine...actually. They're silent for a couple beats. Becca nods a little. N turns and heads up the basement steps.
38) 0) text: Howie finally reaches his destination. It's a beautiful house on a nice block. He slows to a stop at the curb. He puts the car into park. He looks up at the house, and takes a deep breath. He's terrified. He doesn't move. He just sits in his car.
41) 0) text: Becca stops the car a safe distance away, unnoticed by anyone. There's a limo parked at the bottom of the drivew Becca watches as Jason, in a tuxedo, very self-consciousl pins a corsage to a SKINNY GIRL in a prom dress. 86. JASON'S MOTHER, giddy with pride, takes picture after picture. JASON'S BUDDY and his BUDDY'S DATE heckle them f inside the car. When it's time to go, Jason and his date, move to squeeze the back seat. Lots of good-natured shoving, and big dres flipping up, and laughing. Jason's mother, laughing herself, captures it all on film INT. BECCA'’S CAR — CONTINUOUS It's a relatively benign scene, but Becca watches it as someone might watch a car-wreck - stunned, confused, a li disbelieving... The limo doors close, and as it's about to drive off... ...something huge and uncontrollable opens up inside of Becca, and she begins to cry. A lot. She clutches the steering wheel and pretty much loses it.
46) 0) text: He ducks his head in. No one there. INT. DANNY'S ROOM —- CONTINUOUS Howie clicks on the light. Of course there's no one here either. He looks around the room. But there's nothing. Other than the stripped bed, the room is completely empty And slowly, we see Howie’s determination drain out of his body. He’s too late. Becca isn’t here. And he’s convinced she’s actually left him. Spent, Howie sits on the bed, staring off into space. The he quietly takes off his shoes, and lies back on the bed. BACK TO BECCA IN HER CAR - STILL ACROSS FROM JASON’S HOUS The prom car is gone. Becca is alone now. The street is empty again. She finally lets go of the steering wheel. Her crying is pretty much over. But she doesn't start the car. She just sits there.
