22) 51) dialog: This track alone by Memphis Minnie  is worth about $500 if you have the  original 78. She was one of the  greatest guitar players that ever  lived, and a great singer and  songwriter as well. I know the guy  who owns the original and lent it  for use on this reissue.

31) 6) dialog: Do you want to see it? I can run  upstairs and get it...
31) 8) dialog: (to Joe, he always  says this when he  leaves his table) Watch my stuff.
31) 9) text: Seymour exits. An uncomfortable pause as Enid stands at t table. She touches the mongoose's tooth.
31) 14) text: Seymour returns with the 78, holding it like a precious  object.
31) 15) dialog: Here it is. It's only about V minus  and has an incipient lam crack, but  plays decent as I recall.

32) 78) dialog: But the crack is so tight it's  completely inaudible.
32) 81) dialog: I... I didn't think you would have  any interest in this get together...  I mean if you had told me you were  coming I would have warned you --  it's not like a real party or  anything.
32) 83) dialog: Oh God no. This is just junk I have  for sale or trade. The record room  is off-limits.

33) 6) dialog: You think it's healthy to obsessively  collect things? You can't connect  with other people so you fill your  life with stuff...  I'm just like  all the rest of these pathetic  collector losers.
33) 9) dialog: Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why  haven't I had a girlfriend in four  years? I can't even remember the  last time a girl talked to me.

34) 4) dialog: I really didn't get a good look at  her.
34) 7) dialog: (embarrassed) Jesus!
34) 9) dialog: I'm just not one of those guys who  has a "type"...
34) 11) dialog: (he doesn't really  mean this) I mean as long as she's not a complete  imbecile and she's even remotely  attractive...
34) 16) text: Norman nods politely. Seymour looks quizzically at Enid.
35) 2) dialog: Maybe I don't want to meet someone  who shares my interests.  I hate my  interests! Where can I go to meet  the exact opposite of myself?

38) 19) dialog: Uh, I don't have much money with me  right now.

43) 2) dialog: God, that asshole's voice is so  hateful! No wonder I never listen to  the radio!

43) 7) dialog: I brought it for him to autograph.   He's going to be amazed to see it -  it's one of two known copies... I  can't believe they have him for the  opening act and not the headliner.   What an insult!

45) 11) dialog: Hello. Uh... that was great music,  huh?
45) 13) dialog: Actually, technically what he was  mostly playing would more accurately  be classified in the "ragtime" idiom.  Although of course not in the  strictest sense of the more classical  ragtime piano music like that of  Scott Joplin or Joseph Lamb. Authentic  Blues has a more conventional twelve- bar structure in its stanzas.
45) 15) text: ANGLE ON: Enid standing alone at the bar. We see Seymour Cute Girl from her POV. Her gaze drifts to the other peop in the bar. WE MOVE OVER the faces of all the guys and st on a skinny, introverted-looking guy with a pool-cue. He  makes a shot and instantly goes into an ostentatious cue  twirling routine. Her gaze drifts on. She sees herself in a mirror behind the bar and takes off her hat reconfiguring her hair. She reaches into her purs and puts on a bulkier pair of glasses. This is interrupte by BLUESHAMMER taking the stage. Young, white, cocky, pre boys.
45) 18) text: A din of loud noise. CUTE GIRL immediately leaps to her f boogeying to the music. Several horny ALPHA MALES press in on Seymour (who's stil sitting), spilling his drink as they vie to dance with he Seymour extricates himself from the table and walks towar the bar where Enid sits.
45) 19) dialog: What did you tell that girl?
45) 21) dialog: Jesus...
46) 1) dialog: Now I remember why I haven't gone  anywhere in months. I'm not even in  the same universe as those creatures  back there. I might as well be from  another planet.
46) 3) dialog: Look, I really appreciate your help,  Enid, but let's face it, this is  hopeless.
46) 5) dialog: Yeah, well it's simple for everybody  else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair  of Nikes and they're happy! I just  can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
46) 7) dialog: But it's not totally hopeless for  you... I've had it. I don't even  have the energy to try anymore.  You  should make sure you do the exact  opposite of everything I do so you  don't end up like me...
46) 9) dialog: Hooray for me.

48) 6) dialog: What?... Oh that... I borrowed that  from work about fifteen years ago...  I guess it's mine now.
48) 8) dialog: Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks  a lot!... Do you know the Cook's  Chicken franchise?
48) 10) dialog: Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made  up name. When they originally opened  back in 1922 they were named "The  Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early  painting of their first logo.
48) 12) dialog: I'm obsessed with all this stuff -  this lost culture of the 20th century.
48) 15) text: The record ends. Seymour gets up to take it off the turnt
48) 16) dialog: (somewhat bitterly) It's ancient history. The same reason  nobody knows about this Lionel Belasco  record.
48) 18) dialog: Actually, I was a whole lot more  interested in the Cook's phenomenon  when I was about your age. I've kind  of lost interest since I've been  working for them...
48) 20) dialog: For nineteen years...
48) 22) dialog: Nothing so glamorous... actually,  I'm an assistant manager at their  corporate headquarters.
48) 24) dialog: Hey, I get good benefits, a good  early retirement plan, nobody ever  bothers me...
48) 26) dialog: I make enough money to eat and buy  old records... what more do I want?
48) 29) dialog: No, in a lot of ways things are better  now... I dunno... it's complicated.  Everybody still hates each other,  but they know how to hide it better,  or something...
48) 31) dialog: What? Why?
48) 33) dialog: I dunno... they're very sensitive at  work about all this stuff. Maybe it  would be better if you --

55) 10) dialog: Oh... uh... It's just this elastic  thing I have to wear for lumbar  support...
55) 12) dialog: Maybe now you understand why I can't  get a date.
55) 14) dialog: (sarcastically cheering  her on) That's the spirit!
55) 16) dialog: Really?
55) 18) dialog: I'm starting to think that even if I  did get a girlfriend it really  wouldn't change anything.
55) 20) dialog: Then again, that's easy for me to  say, since I'll never even get a  date. I'm sure you have hundreds of  guys who are interested in you.
55) 22) dialog: Oh yeah?
55) 24) dialog: Why?
55) 26) dialog: I won't even dignify that with a  response.
55) 29) dialog: (a sore subject) Who knows?
55) 30) text: The phone RINGS. Seymour ignores it.
55) 32) dialog: Let the machine get it. I have no  desire to talk to anyone who would  be calling me...
55) 33) text: After several more RINGS the machine picks up and we hear Seymour's message. After the BEEP there's a long fumbling pause...
55) 34) dialog: I knew it... it's my mother.
55) 37) dialog: It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
55) 39) dialog: (still confused) Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called  before once... it's just somebody  trying to humiliate me.

59) 10) dialog: No, really I --

59) 18) dialog: Uh, no. I missed that one. But what  do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy  movies.

70) 9) dialog: (he looks nervously  at his watch) Oh... pretty well, surprisingly...  you know...
70) 11) dialog: Sort of... she doesn't dislike any  of that stuff... she's trying,  anyway... actually, we're supposed  to go antique shopping for her  apartment this afternoon...
70) 13) text: Seymour looks again at his watch.
70) 14) dialog: We really should get together sometime  soon... I-I'll definitely call you  this week --
70) 16) dialog: No... no, it's just that I should  get going in a few minutes, and --
70) 18) dialog: I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --

73) 8) dialog: I... I wish I could, Enid, but I  really can't right now... I -- it's  just that I --
73) 10) dialog: It's just that, well, you know, Dana  just got out of a really bad  relationship and I don't want to  give her the wrong idea... you know...
73) 13) dialog: Oh, uh... they were a present from  Dana.
73) 15) dialog: Well, you know... what do I know  about clothes... I've never been the  most fashionable guy -- it's nice to  have someone do all the work for  me...
73) 17) dialog: No, of course I do... It's just that  right now I need to --
73) 19) dialog: No, no... not exactly... she just  doesn't understand how I would know  somebody like you...
73) 21) dialog: Just someone so young...
73) 23) dialog: I... I don't think so.
73) 25) dialog: No, of course not.
73) 27) dialog: In what way do you mean?
73) 29) dialog: (not sure what to  say; long pause) I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's  a very jealous person. I just don't  want to screw that up right now...  I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we  can go back to being friends...
73) 31) dialog: ...What do you mean?
81) 0) text: A knock on the door - Seymour shuffles out in T-shirt, pa and goofy slippers. He looks through the peephole and see Enid. He opens the door.

82) 7) text: Seymour takes another slug off the bottle.
82) 8) dialog: God, she's going to kill me... this  bottle is half-empty!
