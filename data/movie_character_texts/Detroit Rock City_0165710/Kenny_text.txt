54) 0) text: Just as the DISCO TUNE playing in the Trans Am hits the n chorus, a fistful of pizza SPLATTERS across the windshiel Freaked, Kenny swerves and zigzags all over the road. Righting himself, Kenny's entire family might as well hav been insulted.

56) 11) dialog: And if it ain't cleaned off?
56) 13) dialog: (ignoring Christine) Answer me, hippie girl. And if the  mess ain't cleaned off my car?
56) 15) text: Kenny looks at Bobby and they exchange moronic grins.
56) 16) dialog: You're a smart little homo, aren't  you, hippie girl? But, while astounded  at your nimble, friggin' insight, I  still detect an issue hanging fire,  namely: where does a sharp-witted  faggot like yourself get off doing  such a dopey thing like that there?
56) 17) text: Hawk figured out that any answer he gives will be incorre and has decided to wait till Kenny's done.

56) 29) text: And with that, Kenny grabs himself a fistful of Hawk's lo hair and pulls him over to the Trans Am. He wipes the piz off with Hawk's hair, tugging Hawk's head up and down, ba and forth. Hawk GRUNTS with each wipe, but doesn't give K the satisfaction of hearing him scream. Trip, Lex, and Jam watch helplessly, trapped under Bobby' dull-witted, but equally threatening gaze. Kenny gets the last of the big chunks off his windshield looks at his handiwork.

FOLLOW a chunk of cartridge and a strand of mangled tape  streaming from it as it sails back toward the side of the road, landing at Jam's feet. TILT UP to Jam's face. He raises his eyes and turns to th CAMERA, a single tear rolling down his cheek, just like t Indian in that "Keep America Beautiful" litter ad. Hawk rises and Kenny comes face-to-face with him.
56) 46) dialog: So. All that having been said and  done, I believe we are ready for the  final topic of discussion. Namely:  Have you learned your lesson yet,  puke?
56) 47) text: Hawk pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it. He  blows some smoke in Kenny's face.

56) 52) text: Out of original material, Kenny goes for an old stand by.
56) 53) dialog: That's not what your mother said  last night.
56) 58) text: Kenny draws a blank, not being prepared for this one.
56) 60) text: Kenny chuckles and looks at Bobby. They have a good littl laugh... the homo's got balls! Then Kenny turns back to H
56) 61) dialog: Okay, fagmo... I'll tell you what  your mother said last night. (beat) She said that I was the fuck of her  life.
56) 64) dialog: (smirking) Sure.
56) 65) text: Quick as a shot, Hawk SLAMS the bottom of the can into Ke nose, crushing it flat against his face. Hawaiian backwas spews from its tab hole like blood as Kenny falls backwar from the impact. He hits his head on the ground. Taking this as a cue... Trip whips out his wallet on a  chain... Lex rips off his KISS belt... And Jam yanks out drumsticks. As if choreographed, Trip swoops the wallet at Bobby's fe snagging him around the ankles tightly with the chain. Le THWAMS Bobby in the face with his big KISS belt buckle le a reversed, red, KISS logo branded in his forehead. Trip yanks the chain pulling Bobby off his feet. When he  hits the ground, Jam's right there DRUMMING his balls. Bobby shrieks. Meanwhile, Hawk advances on Kenny who tries to get the ca off his face, but it's stuck on looking like a pig's nose with fruit punch for snot. Hawk raises both his hands in Kenny's face, then executes the final insult... Hawk messes Kenny's hair. Kenny lets a scream that comes from the bottom of his vanity. Hawk grabs Kenny by the ears and brings the guido's head  swiftly against his kneecap. Kenny falls to the ground,  unconscious on top of Bobby. Their heads collide knocking Bobby out cold. Terrified, Barbara leaps from the Trans Am and is cornere
