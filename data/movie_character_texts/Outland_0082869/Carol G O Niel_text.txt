If you were in front of me...I would change my mind...and I don't want to change my mind. O'Niel feels behind him for a chair...and slowly sits down...never taking his eyes off the screen.

CAROL (cont'd) Oh God...I just can't take it anymore...that's really what it amounts to. We've gone over this so many times before. We've had the same erying from me, and the same assurances from you that the next place will be different. It never is different. It can't be. (pause) So something snapped in me yesterday. I couldn't bear to watch Paulie clatter around another bleak place, He has no friends. Ever since he was born, he has been trucked off from one cesspool to the next... a year or two at a time. He's a child...and he's never set foot on Earth. Never. He reads books and looks at pictures of Earth all day long...and then he hides them from you so your feelings won't be hurt. He's like his father. He never complains. He's not like his mother, God knows. O'Niel's face is rim lit by the glow from the television monitor. He folds his hands together, and rests his chin on them.
2) 21) dialog: Don't you see...he deserves a childhood. He deserves the chance to breathe air...real outside air...where you don't broil...or explode..-air that smells like life...not like a ventilating unit. (pause) You think that it's all worth it. You think that you go where they send you...you keep the good old peace...and do the good old job. Well...I'm not as fortunate as you. I don't have your abiding faith. I can't see anything except one God-forsaken mining 16. 17. 20. Continued. 16. CAROL (cont'd) town that looks just like every other one. The Company is the same...the greedy people are the same...the violence is the same. I'm just not as good as you are. I don't think it's all worth it. O'Niel clenches his jaw...causing the small muscles in his cheek to twitch.
2) 22) dialog: So...so I'm taking Paulie back home. I love you. You don't deserve this. You deserve the best. I just have to go, my love. I will contact you in a few days. She looks straight at the camera...straight at us... she tries to say something else...except she can't. Her eyes are filled with tears. She swallows. She vainly tries to smile...and can manage no more than a pathetic little shrug. The screen flickers to black. Writing appears: END MESSAGES O'NIEL, W.T. O'Niel stays fixed in his chair...still staring at the screen...the writing blinking on and off. He doesn't move. cur TO: THURSDAY, 8:30 A.M. - 17.

37) 9) dialog: I*m doing it again. I've had so much time to prepare what I am going to say. I was going to be so devastatingly clever. And here I am...looking at your face and my mouth has gone to mush. Jesus, O'NIEL . How is Paulie?
37) 10) dialog: He's fine. I promised him he could talk to you. He's in the next room...probably destroying the furniture. There is an awkward silence. O'Niel keeps looking at the image of her face in the television monitor.
37) 11) dialog: Are you feeling well?
37) 13) dialog: I'm...ah...Paulie and I... our reservations have come through...and...ah...we're booked on a flight home. O'Niel nods silently.

37) 16) dialog: Please...
37) 18) dialog: Why...for God's sake?
37) 20) dialog: What is so important?
37) 22) dialog: Do you think you're making a difference? Do you think you're making the universe a better place? Do you think what you're doing is worth giving up your family for? O'Niel tries to answer. All he can do is shake his head.
37) 23) dialog: You're a stubborn son of a bitch.
37) 25) dialog: Something is wrong there, isn't it?
37) 27) dialog: You're in trouble...I know it. Every time you start speaking in sentences of less than two words...I know you're in some kind of trouble. O'Niel looks at her and manages a somewhat ironic smile.
