13) 1) dialog: Hey, what’s up?
13) 3) dialog: You have friends over?

29) 32) dialog: I know - he’s not a drummer, and as far as I can tell, he’s not in rehab.
44) 13) dialog: Here she is, back from her big date. How'd it go?
44) 15) dialog: Right. Lori has something to say, but isn’t sure she should. She starts, stops, starts again.
44) 16) dialog: Listen, honey, I’m not sure this is a good idea.
44) 18) dialog: Pretending you like a guy... I don’t want to see you get hurt.

63) 35) dialog: And the thing that kills me is, it’s all my fault.
63) 37) dialog: What you said the other day? You were right. How were you supposed to know how to act if I didn’t show you? How were you supposed to learn about men when I was always dating bums? (CONTINUED)
63) 41) dialog: Yeah, one good idea after seventeen years of screwing you up. Kate, you’re beautiful, you’re smart, you’re fun - you deserve to be popular, you deserve to date whoever you want to. All you needed was a chance. I’m sorry for being selfish.
63) 43) dialog: (beat, then) You want to know something sad? The first thing that popped into my head is “let’s move to a new town and start over.” Kate laughs.
63) 44) dialog: I’m sorry. I’m really trying, but I just don’t know.
63) 46) dialog: Did it?
