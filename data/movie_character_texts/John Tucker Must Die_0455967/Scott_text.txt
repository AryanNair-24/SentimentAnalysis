12) 9) dialog: Is that for her or him?
12) 13) dialog: That’s not usually the noise girls make when they look at him. Usually it’s more of a “ohhhhh...”
12) 15) dialog: I guess he is kind of a jerk, isn’t he?
12) 17) dialog: Close. Older brother.
12) 19) dialog: Scott Tucker.
12) 21) dialog: Don’t be. If anything, I’m embarrassed about being his brother. I think my mom was experimenting with drugs or living on a toxic waste dump when she had him. Kate laughs. They’re interrupted by a bell. SCOTT (CONT’D) Damn, I’ve got to run. Don’t worry, your secret’s safe with me, Kate. Scott winks and heads off. INT.

27) 1) dialog: Kate, hey, you don’t have a lab partner, do you?
27) 3) dialog: I’m not making fun of you, I’m asking if you need a partner. Mine got burned pretty bad in the last experiment, and he won’t be back for awhile.
27) 5) dialog: Well, that’s open to interpretation. He says it was my fault, but I clearly said “Dear God! Run for your life!”
27) 7) dialog: Thank you. So what are we doing?
27) 13) dialog: Check you out. “Meniscus.” If I would have known how smart you were, I would have set my last partner on fire weeks ago.
27) 15) dialog: Much better. Okay, I’1l try. Scott pours again, but carelessly splashes some on his pa He starts to freak, urgently whispering to Kate: SCOTT (CONT’D) I spilled it! What do I do? What is it? What is it?

34) 5) dialog: Nice, but I don’t think it really qualifies as a sport. If I can do it- He kicks his leg in the air, promptly knocking over a row beakers, smashing them.
34) 7) dialog: You know, I never see you out.
34) 11) dialog: At parties, around... I know you’re new. If you're interested, I could let you know when something’s going on.
34) 13) dialog: Actually, there’s a party this weekend. I could tell you where it is.
34) 15) dialog: Or I could, you know, pick you up.
34) 17) dialog: No, I’m just not good at directions. Giving them or following them. So I just thought it would be easier to pick you up. There's a commotion at the door - Kate looks to see a boy enter the room, carrying flowers. He goes up to the teach SCOTT (CONT’D) I mean, if you want me to ask you out, I suppose it could be that, too. I don’t want to compromise our great working relationship as lab partners, but- Kate didn’t hear, distracted by the scene at the door.
34) 19) dialog: Oh, I was just saying- The teacher points at the door.
36) 16) dialog: She’s not your type.
36) 18) dialog: Well, then, you’re definitely not hers. She listens to Elvis Costello, she reads Salinger for fun, not for class... she'd see through you in a second.
36) 24) dialog: Maybe if we headed down to the nursing home, you’d have a chance with her grandma. John chuckles, which the other guys take as their cue tha it’s okay to laugh along.

42) 16) dialog: Hey, big brother. Dad told me you're adopted. John laughs and walks away with Kate, who looks over her shoulder and smiles at Scott. Once she’s gone, Scott shak his head in disbelief.
45) 57) dialog: What are you doing here?
45) 59) dialog: Not if the guy’s you, and not now. John sits down, picks up a guitar, starts noodling on it he and Scott talk. SCOTT (CONT’D) Fine. How’s life, John?
45) 61) dialog: Trouble sleeping, aside from that, okay.
45) 63) dialog: Please tell me you don’t want to go fishing and bond or something. Wait a second - do you have some incurable disease?
45) 67) dialog: If I were going to help you with anything, it wouldn’t be seducing some poor girl. Whoever she is, she’s better off without you. (CONTINUED )
45) 71) dialog: I won't. John puts down the guitar and starts to leave. Scott suddenly sits up. SCOTT (CONT’D) Wait a second, Kate Spencer?
45) 73) dialog: What do you want me to do?
45) 75) dialog: Fine, I’11 do it.

46) 25) dialog: So where’s the candidate? Kate points - Scott sees Sal.
46) 26) dialog: Holy crap! (quickly recovering) I’ve never seen a real candidate before! Kate grabs Scott’s hand and pulls him away. They move as fast as they can, trying not to look at each other, becau every time they do, they laugh. Finally, when they’re a s distance away:
46) 28) dialog: What are you doing here? I’m always volunteering for political campaigns. (off her look) All right, John sent me. It’s his way of keeping an eye on you without making it look like he’s keeping an eye on you. I’m supposed to play it cool, make sure you're actually here, not give anything away. (CONTINUED)
46) 32) dialog: Or am I the best spy in the world? Kate shakes her head, pulls Scott through the crowd.
47) 0) text: Kate and Scott sit across from each other at a table, lic envelopes. Scott nods at one of the posters.
47) 1) dialog: I hope this guy doesn’t make any speeches outside. You know, a gust of wind comes up and suddenly... Scott mimes Sal flying away as his ears catch the wind.
47) 3) dialog: I’d be careful. He’s only forty feet away - I’m sure he can hear you.
47) 7) dialog: (laughing, teasing her) Excuse meeb?
47) 11) dialog: It’s almost like your tongue is stuck.
47) 13) dialog: Stob it ribe now? Kate’s laughing so hard she almost falls out of her chair After she calms down a bit: SCOTT (CONT’D) Listen, I’ve got to ask you something. Why are you going out with my brother? Kate stops laughing completely, takes a sip of a soda to clean off her tongue.
47) 15) dialog: The first time I saw you, you didn’t seem too impressed by him.
47) 17) dialog: That they’re always right?
47) 19) dialog: You just seemed like the kind of girl who wouldn't go for him. (shrugs) I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. Everyone dates my brother. (quickly) But I’m sure you’ll be the last. I’m sure you’re the one. Hey, these envelopes aren't going to lick themselves. Scott busies himself with an envelope. Kate joins him. 80.
57) 3) dialog: I think you won.
57) 5) dialog: I know, how smart are you? Kate laughs. As she talks, she steps up and down in place keeping her muscles warm. Scott notices, starts stepping along with her. (CONTINUED)
57) 9) dialog: (looks at his legs) Wow, I didn’t even notice I was doing it. It’s like, when you talk to a guy with an accent and you start doing the accent? (Indian accent) I am having much fun dancing with you. Please try the papadums.
57) 11) dialog: You sure you’re not going to cramp up? I mean, you were jogging at a pretty torrid pace.
57) 13) dialog: No way. I’m just a big talker. Absolutely nothing to back it up. Kate laughs, then grabs at one leg, staggers forward.
57) 15) dialog: I guess you weren't kidding. I’m almost feeling guilty for making fun of you. He kneels down in front of her, works on the cramping cal massaging it.
57) 17) dialog: Oh, something big. Like a leg falling off. (CONTINUED)
57) 21) dialog: Feeling better?
57) 23) dialog: Good.
57) 26) dialog: Yeah, absolutely. Okay, good running into you. Kate smiles, turns, sprints away. Scott watches her go. INT. GIRL’S BATHROOM - DAY Our four girls are gathered in the bathroom.

58) 8) dialog: Yeah, I’ve been getting a little of- (makes same gesture) That too. (CONTINUED )
58) 12) dialog: Hold that thought. You’ve got a visitor. Scott points to the door. John is there, waving. Perfect timing. Kate walks out of the room.
63) 3) dialog: Since when are you friends with those three?
63) 5) dialog: And since when are they even friends? I didn’t realize that little video they made about John had brought them so close together. (CONTINUED)
63) 11) dialog: So, it was just some game the three of you cooked up, making him fall for you, and then what? You’re going to dump him? Kate nods. SCOTT (CONT’D) At the assembly. Of course. (then) You want to hear something ironic? Do you know why he fell for you? Because you were the first person who was honest with him. The first person who treated him like a human being. This lands hard on Kate.
63) 15) dialog: No. (then) He probably does deserve it, in some way.
63) 17) dialog: In some way he does deserve it, but in another way... Look, do you really think it’s all his fault? He is what he is. He doesn’t really go out of his way to hide it. So who’s to blame - him, or the girls who keep lining up to date him, even knowing everything they know about him? (then) And what’s his big sin, really? Lying to women to get them to fall in love with him? God, that’s horrible. I bet you can’t imagine what kind of person would do that, can you, Kate? Scott turns and exits, leaving a shattered Kate.

66) 7) dialog: Kissing you? Romantically? Although every second we talk about it, it’s becoming less romantic and more uncomfortable. You’re just looking at me. Time is passing. It’s getting really bad now.
66) 11) dialog: I think I suspected it when I first saw you, and I was sure when you glued your tongue to your mouth...
66) 13) dialog: I’m... sorry?
