29) 10) dialog: I know I look like a player, but the truth is, I meant every word I said to every one of those girls. The sad thing is, no matter how much I want it, I haven’t had that great love returned yet. I haven’t found that one girl who is the only girl for me. I haven’t found that one person who I can give myself completely to, who I can tell my secrets, who I can cry with, share my pain, hold, hug... Back in the audience, two female teachers are standing ne to each other. They’re as smitten as anyone. One leans ov and whispers to the other:
