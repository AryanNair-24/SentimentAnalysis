45) 2) dialog: Ooh, I’d love to go out, but I have plans.
45) 4) dialog: Just stuff. John’s a little put-off - has he lost it?
45) 6) dialog: I’1l put you on my list. (CONTINUED)
45) 10) dialog: No you’re not, you big slut.
45) 12) dialog: I never realized being popular could be so boring.
45) 19) dialog: Please tell me that’s not on your schedule. Carrie looks embarrassed, closes her notebook. It clearly on her schedule.
45) 22) dialog: You think he’s still watching? The phone rings. Kate reaches for it, Carrie catches her.
45) 24) dialog: Hello?
45) 27) dialog: Who's this?
45) 29) dialog: Oh, hey. I just got in. What’s up? (CONTINUED)
45) 33) dialog: I’m doing fine. How about you? You have a good night?
45) 35) dialog: Busy, but good. John waits, but there’s no more information forthcoming.
45) 37) dialog: Oooh... I think I’m booked.
45) 39) dialog: Listen, it’s not a date, if you’re worried- Now that he knows it’s not a date, John relaxes greatly.
45) 41) dialog: You think once a man gets married, he can tell his wife what to do?
45) 43) dialog: I’m actually going to be helping my mom out on that campaign I was telling you about. You can stop by, if you want.
45) 47) dialog: Sure thing. (then) Oh, crap.
45) 49) dialog: Oh, nothing. My mom’s been saying there’s some perv checking out our house all night, and I think I see him.
45) 51) dialog: Nah, I’1l just call the cops. KATE’S POV John’s car speeds away. INT. JOHN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS John takes a corner, phone clutched against his shoulder.
46) 0) text: The nerve center of the campaign is basically a sparsely furnished office space with “Valetta for Mayor” banners a posters with the candidate’s grinning face. Volunteers wo the phones and stuff envelopes. Kate is here - she’s licking, folding and stamping with the best of them. Her comes up with the candidate himself.
46) 2) dialog: It’s a pleasure to meet- (CONTINUED)
46) 7) dialog: (carefully choosing her words) It’s a very good picture.
46) 10) dialog: He seems great, mom, really...
46) 12) dialog: No, not that. Lori laughs.
46) 13) dialog: But that’s good. It’s different.
46) 15) dialog: Scott? (CONTINUED)
46) 19) dialog: It’s John’s brother. Scott! Scott crosses over.
46) 21) dialog: What are you doing here?
46) 23) dialog: Sorry. Scott, this is my mom.
46) 27) dialog: So, what are you doing here?
46) 31) dialog: You’re like the worst spy in the world.
47) 0) text: Kate and Scott sit across from each other at a table, lic envelopes. Scott nods at one of the posters.
47) 2) dialog: I saw him trip once - it took three minutes to hit the ground. Scott lowers his voice and points across the room.
47) 4) dialog: Hear me? He can take my pulse. Across the room, Sal sees Kate and Scott looking over, sm and gives a big thumbs-up. They wave back.
47) 5) dialog: Oh my god, I think you were right. At least, Kate tries to say that, but all the glue from licking the envelopes messes up her speech, and what she really says is:
47) 6) dialog: Oh my gob, I think you bere ribe.
47) 8) dialog: I thing my tonbue is tuck. (CONTINUED)
47) 12) dialog: Stob it!
47) 14) dialog: (trying to be casual) Why do you ask?
47) 16) dialog: You know what they say about first impressions.
47) 18) dialog: Is that what they say? I’ve been using that saying wrong for a long time.
48) 1) dialog: So, I finally let John take me to dinner. I’ve got to be honest - I know it’s an act, but John Tucker makes you feel like the only woman in the world. As John and Kate enter the restaurant, Kate discovers tha
50) 1) dialog: He rented out the best restaurant in the city just for us. Complete with entertainment. Three men come out, dressed up like a barbershop quartet, except, well, there are three of them. They begin singing

52) 3) dialog: Do you ever turn it off?
52) 5) dialog: Okay, I guess you don’t.
52) 7) dialog: Seriously, do you ever take a break and just be John Tucker?
52) 9) dialog: No, that’s John Tucker, trying to impress Kate Spencer by talking about how great women’s track is. What do you want to talk about? What do you really care about? (CONTINUED)
52) 13) dialog: Quit changing the subject. What do you care about, besides basketball?
52) 16) dialog: (uncomfortable) There’s a lot more to you than basketball.
52) 18) dialog: No, go ahead.

On court, John notices, can’t look away, and trips and falls on his face
53) 20) dialog: You really think I can pull this off?
53) 28) dialog: I’m almost ready... Carrie opens the door and peeks in.
53) 30) dialog: How do I look? Kate opens up her robe, showing off her lingerie. It’s bl and sexy, and Kate’s in great shape.
53) 37) dialog: Yeah, I'll pass on that. I think the less I take after my mom, the happier I’1l be.
53) 39) dialog: I wouldn’t want the kind of guy who just wants me to look like this.
53) 41) dialog: No. Is it? (thinks about it) Oh my god.
53) 49) dialog: Whatcha doin’?
53) 51) dialog: Yeah, I bet. You alone? John snaps his fingers at his teammate, points to the bathroom. The roommate glares, heads in, closes the door.
53) 53) dialog: Uh, yeah.
53) 55) dialog: Not Heather. The girls groan.
53) 56) dialog: I mean, they wanted to put me with Heather, but she didn’t want to be with me, because, you know, I’m dating you.
53) 58) dialog: I know, isn’t that sad? I’m so lovely. She’s looking at a sign that Carrie’s holding up. Carrie glares, scribbles on it, holds it back up. (CONTINUED)
53) 60) dialog: Lonely. I’m so lonely.
53) 62) dialog: That’s just what I was thinking. 88. But there’s a problem - I just tried to go out in the hall, and coach Williams is totally watching. No way you could get here.
53) 64) dialog: I mean, unless you went out on the ledge and came in through the window.
53) 66) dialog: Yeah, that’s crazy. Too bad, I got all dressed up. Or down. Kate lets her robe slip off one shoulder, showing off one strap.
53) 68) dialog: Awesome. I’m five windows down. I already counted.
53) 70) dialog: Hold on!
53) 72) dialog: Did you shave? it’s working. her hand, (CONTINUED)
53) 76) dialog: Your chest?
53) 78) dialog: This is kind of crazy, but I have a thing for swimmers.
53) 80) dialog: There’s something so sexy about a smooth body. You know, like a swimmer.
53) 82) dialog: It’s nuts, but when a guy isn’t shaved, it’s like wrestling a bear. I just don’t like hair rubbing all over my bare skin. Kate lets the robe fall off, so she’s just wearing her br
53) 84) dialog: Everything. Legs, armpits, everything. Totally smooth.
53) 86) dialog: No, of course not. Heather waves her arms.
53) 87) dialog: Hold on. (CONTINUED)
53) 90) dialog: Um, yeah, your hair, too.
53) 92) dialog: If you love me, you'll do it. (then) I didn’t want you to, but when you said you wouldn’t... I know if I loved someone, there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for them. John hesitates. This is a biggie. Carrie yawns. Kate follows suit, gives a huge yawn for John’s benefit, then pulls her robe back on.
53) 93) dialog: You know what? Maybe you're right. I’11 just see you tomorrow.
53) 95) dialog: Be careful on the ledge. Oh, and I’m going to turn the lights out, okay? I’ma little shy. Just get comfortable and climb in. Kate blows John a kiss. Carrie closes the computer. The girls burst out laughing.
55) 0) text: People are filing out of their rooms to see what all the commotion is about. Carrie and Beth aren’t there, but Heather and Kate are part of the growing crowd. Coach Williams comes out of her room, John in tow. He’s still wearing his boxers, and Coach Williams is using the a handle to pull him along. She’s got them hiked so far u that there isn’t much breathing space left inside them.
55) 2) dialog: Sorry. I guess it was six windows. Finally John’s coach comes into the hall.
56) 1) dialog: John’s aura was punctured. Don’t get me wrong - he was still John Tucker, and he managed to put a good spin on it almost immediately. John meets up with a bunch of other guys from his basketb team - they now all have shaved heads. They high five, admire each other.
57) 0) text: Late afternoon, Kate trains alone, sprinting around the t as fast as she can, really pushing.
57) 1) dialog: But he was in love, he was getting desperate, he was almost ready for the big fall. All I had to do was deliver. And nothing was going to get in my way. Kate stops in her tracks.
57) 2) dialog: Scott! Scott stands on the side of the track. He applauds.
57) 4) dialog: I’m the only one running.
57) 8) dialog: Okay, you can stop making fun of me any time. I’ve just got to keep moving so I don’t cramp up.
57) 10) dialog: Okay, we’re stopping. Kate stops, Scott follows suit.
57) 12) dialog: You want to race? Come on, I just did five miles, I’1l still slaughter you.
57) 14) dialog: Ow, Ow, OW... She collapses into Scott’s arms. Scott picks her up, carr her over to a bench and sets her down.
57) 16) dialog: “Almost?” What would it take to make you feel guilty?
57) 20) dialog: Nice. Kate and Scott laugh. Scott looks up at Kate... Kate look down at Scott... his hands are on her leg... and all of a sudden, things are weird. There’s a definite vibe in the air. They both immediately get uncomfortable. Scott lets of her leg and stands up.
57) 22) dialog: Yeah.
57) 24) dialog: Thanks. After a long pause:
57) 25) dialog: I should finish my workout before I-
57) 29) dialog: Yeah, about that... maybe we’ve done enough.
57) 33) dialog: I mean, we made the guy look like an idiot at the hotel...
57) 36) dialog: I know how much you love plans, I’m just not sure how much more we need to do. The girls stare at her. Not happily. Finally
57) 37) dialog: It’s just feeling kind of, I don’t know, weird. Carrie snaps.
57) 40) dialog: Look at what this guy does! You’re as obsessed with trying to destroy him as you were with dating him. You’re still letting him control you. Beth holds up her hand to calm the other two. She goes ov to Kate, puts her arm around her, playing good cop.
57) 42) dialog: I don’t know...
57) 47) dialog: We are. Aren't we?
57) 51) dialog: All right, all right. Momentary lapse. I’m fine. What’s your idea?
57) 88) dialog: Uh... okay... Listen, Heather, no one’s going to deny that you’ve made the biggest sacrifices. But come on, nothing could make me more popular than you. The only reason I’m popular at all is because you’ve taken me under your wing. Just hanging out with you makes everyone think I’m somebody.
57) 96) dialog: No, sorry, she’s still not here, but the second she gets home I’11l- (listens) Hold on, maybe I hear her. (CONTINUED)
57) 99) dialog: Oops, nope, not her, but I’11l let her know. Good talking to you, Sal. Kate hangs up.
57) 100) dialog: He’s called three times.
57) 102) dialog: Why don’t you want to talk to him?
57) 104) dialog: You're avoiding him?
57) 106) dialog: Figures.
57) 108) dialog: I said, it figures. You finally date someone who seems decent, and you dump him as soon as you can.
57) 110) dialog: Are you serious?
57) 114) dialog: Do you know how screwed up that is? You really think dating all those guys, moving to all those places didn’t effect me?
57) 116) dialog: It’s not just friends - can you imagine what it’s like growing up with this? All I’ve done is watch you date jerks who ruin our lives. I’ve started to think all guys are like that. I mean, could my dating life be more screwed up? The first serious relationship I’ve ever had is with a guy I don’t like who has no idea who I really am. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Good thing who you date is none of my business. Kate storms out of the room.
58) 0) text: Kate and Scott are working next to each other.
58) 1) dialog: Hey, did you see Cake has a new album out?
58) 3) dialog: I just got it. Want me to burn you a copy?
58) 5) dialog: Everything okay?
58) 7) dialog: Yeah, sure. Things are just a little... Kate makes a “mixed-up” motion with her hands.
58) 11) dialog: I think it started when-
59) 0) text: Kate joins John.
59) 2) dialog: Yeah, tonight’s not great. I’m just really busy these days - it’s cheer season, and I’ve got to keep my focus.
59) 4) dialog: Absolutely. I/’11 call you.
59) 6) dialog: Yeah, crazy, isn’t it?
59) 8) dialog: Yeah. Okay, see you. Kate heads back into the class. John just stands, watchin her go... He doesn’t look good. He kind of looks like a desperate girl who’s being ignored by the guy she loves.
60) 0) text: Kate walks down the hall - it seems that everyone knows h talks to her, congratulates her... (CONTINUED)
60) 3) dialog: The week leading up to the election seemed to last about a minute, it was so packed. I sure wasn’t invisible any more - I couldn't go anywhere without everyone knowing who I was.
61) 0) text: Kate is waiting on an elderly couple.
61) 2) dialog: John got more and more desperate every day. And night. She looks out her window to find John standing down there guitar in hand, warbling Dashboard Confessional’s “Scream Infidelities.” His usually impressive voice is cracking, interrupted by the tears running down his face. Kate clos the curtains, lies back down, puts a pillow over her face
62) 0) text: Kate walks through the cafeteria with another cheerleader talking.
62) 1) dialog: We didn’t want John to fall completely apart before we had a chance to destroy him publicly, so I did spend some time with him... Kate and the cheerleader sit down at a table, and we see John’s behind them, struggling with their books and trays loaded down with food. He sets everything down for them; when he’s done, Kate pats him on the arm to thank him, th turns back to her friend. John waves weakly and walks awa from the table. INT. KATE’S KITCHEN - DAY Kate is sitting across the table from her mother. They’re both reading as they eat, not making eye contact, not acknowledging each other’s presence. (CONTINUED)
62) 4) dialog: So the plan was rolling along. At home? Not so much. My mom and I hadn’t talked since our fight. Well, that’s not precisely true - I asked her to pass me the potatoes once, and she asked me if I'd picked up toilet paper at the store. So, you know, the lines of communication were Open.
63) 0) text: Kate sits with the other three girls.
63) 1) dialog: And before I knew it, it was the day of the election. The buzz around school - started by Carrie - is that something was going to happen. It was the first time politics were ever popular. We got together that morning to work on my speech. It was tough, but we found five synonyms for the word “womanizer” and seventeen for “dump.” At last, it was finally going to be over, we could get our lives back... I was thinking nothing could possibly go wrong now. They finish; they all get up and head out of the cafe. Ka is the last to leave - she goes over to the trash to thro away her cup, and turns towards the door when she’s surpr to find Scott standing there. Looking extremely confused. KATE (V.O.) (CONT’D) It never pays to think like that.
63) 2) dialog: (busted) Scott. Hey. Good to see you.
63) 4) dialog: Well, Heather’s a cheerleader with me, you know that. And... I just know the other two. From around.
63) 8) dialog: I didn’t know they didn’t get along... scoTtT No, they’ve always hated each other. And yet here they are, still together, with you. Pretty mindblowing. Pretty crazy coincidence that the three girls who tried to humiliate my brother are best friends with his girlfriend. What’s going on? Kate has no answer. SCOTT (CONT’D) God, I was so wrong about you. I thought you were different than everyone else, then you’re hanging with them, you end up falling for my brother-
63) 9) dialog: I didn’t! Scott waits for her to explain herself.
63) 10) dialog: Look, you said yourself that your brother was a jerk. I mean, you've watched him hurt all those girls, dating them, lying to them, dumping them... We just thought we'd give him a taste of his own medicine.
63) 12) dialog: Are you going to tell him? (CONTINUED)
63) 16) dialog: That’s what I thought, that’s why I agreed to go along with this-
63) 19) dialog: I needed to talk to you. Kate sits on the bed.
63) 20) dialog: I know I told you I don’t need your advice about boys. Well, I need your advice about boys.
63) 22) dialog: Okay. Do you think I’m doing the right thing, you know, dumping John tonight? Tough question right off the bat. Lori searches for words (CONTINUED)
63) 25) dialog: I know you didn’t think this was a good idea from the beginning, but it’s too late. I’m in, and I need to know what to do.
63) 27) dialog: I don't know. Maybe there’s more to him. Maybe there’s an actual person there.
63) 29) dialog: Yeah, he did. And if I don’t go through with it, they won’t be my friends anymore.
63) 31) dialog: No, I don’t love him. Kate shakes her head, trying to sort it out.
63) 32) dialog: So, I can ruin the life of a guy who’s never done anything to me, and keep the best friends I’ve ever made in my whole life, or, I can not dump him and lose my friends.
63) 34) dialog: Tough one, huh?
63) 36) dialog: Mom, it’s not your fault-
63) 40) dialog: Well, you told me not to do this.
63) 42) dialog: Thanks. (then) So what do I do?
63) 45) dialog: Don’t worry. I’1l figure it out. This helped.
63) 47) dialog: Not really, but I can tell you’re hanging by a thread. Lori laughs.
63) 48) dialog: You know, you don’t always date bums.
63) 50) dialog: What about Sal?
63) 54) dialog: Maybe that’s a good thing.
64) 9) dialog: Hi, everyone. Thanks. Before I announce the winners, I’d like to say something about one of the people up on this stage. I know this is unusual, but bear with me. As some of you know, I’m not completely objective about this election; I’ve been dating John Tucker for awhile now. I’ve learned alot, and I think it’s time I share it all with you. A murmur from the crowd: here it comes.
64) 10) dialog: Sometimes you think you know a person. Especially popular people - you think that smiling, friendly face they put on is the real person. Sometimes they even start to believe it about themselves. If everyone loves them, they couldn’t be so bad, could they? But I’m afraid that sometimes that person is rotten to the core, they’re a liar and a cheat and they've gotten their popularity by using people and then casting them aside. They hurt people that they’re supposed to care about, and that’s just unforgivable. There are no excuses for that kind of behavior, and anyone who does that should be punished. Heather, Carrie and Beth are practically gleeful: all the work is about to pay off. Carrie holds a camcorder up, to capture the moment.
64) 11) dialog: As you’ve probably guessed, the person I’m talking about is me. Gasps and shock all around.
64) 12) dialog: I used John. I did everything I could to get him to fall in love with me, because I knew that if he did, I'd be popular. And it worked. Here I am. But to do it, I was lying to all of you about who I really was, and I had to hurt John, who'd never done anything to me. I’m sorry.
64) 13) dialog: I don't deserve to be standing up here, I don’t deserve all the attention I’ve been getting...
64) 17) dialog: (to John) And I don’t deserve you. I think that buried deep deep deep inside of you, there’s a really sensitive, wonderful guy that’s going to come out for the right girl. I’m not her. I hope you find her. (back to audience) Thanks again for everything. I know I’m giving up a lot by doing this, including some really great friends, but I didn’t really earn any of it. So, goodbye. She starts to walk off, pauses, goes back to the mic.
64) 18) dialog: One more thing. Why do we all make fools of ourself chasing after the John Tuckers of the world, anyway? Why are we so busy defining ourselves by other people? I don’t have an answer, I just thought it was a good question. (then) Oh, and also, since I probably won't ever have everyone’s attention like this again... It wouldn’t kill you all to come out to a girls’ track meet once in awhile. And with that, Kate walks off the stage, leaving behind a stunned crowd. John looks at the crowd, looks at Kate disappearing, and runs after her.
65) 0) text: John catches up with Kate.
65) 2) dialog: John, don’t. I’m really not the right person for you.
65) 4) dialog: Look, I’m sorry-
65) 6) dialog: Thank me? (CONTINUED)
65) 10) dialog: That was kind of the twist. Tricky, huh?
65) 12) dialog: Really?
65) 14) dialog: ..-Compassion?
65) 17) dialog: Good luck. They shake hands; Kate goes in and kisses him on the chee She then turns and exits the building.
65) 18) dialog: And then, as I was walking out of there, I realized that there was one person who noticed me before John did. One person who did seem to like me for who I was.
66) 0) text: Kate exits the gym and walks out into the night.
66) 1) dialog: But I figured my chances with him were slightly damaged by the fact that he hated me.
66) 3) dialog: Luckily, I was wrong. Kate turns to find Scott running to her. When he catches her: scoTtT Does this mean you’re not dating my brother anymore?
66) 4) dialog: I think so.
66) 6) dialog: What do you think you’re doing?
66) 8) dialog: And just exactly long have you been attracted to me? (CONTINUED)
66) 12) dialog: So why didn’t you say anything? You know, this is all kind of your fault. You should have asked me out the second you met me, not taken “no” for an answer, and saved me from this whole mess.
66) 14) dialog: (smiles) So am I. And he kisses her. She returns the kiss and they embrace, not letting go. KATE (V.O.) (CONT’D) So what happened to everyone?
67) 1) dialog: Even though it didn’t happen quite how we hoped, we still ended up teaching John Tucker a lesson and changing him forever. John finally snaps and yells back at his coach:
69) 1) dialog: Amazingly, another John Tucker didn’t spring up to take his place. From that time on, the guys at our school treated the women like princesses. The girl makes no move to open her own door; glances over her boyfriend. He runs around the car, opens her door for her, waits for her to get in, and closes the door. KATE (V.O.) (CONT’D) After seeing what women could do to even the mighty John Tucker when we put our minds to it, they were scared to death of us.
70) 0) text: Kate sits alone.
70) 1) dialog: What about the other girls? Like I said, we were just together to take care of John Tucker, and once that was done, there was no reason to hang out. The other three join Kate at the table, setting down drin and muffins. KATE (V.O.) (CONT’D) No reason except that we were all pretty amazing people who taught each other that men come and go, but friends are forever. We stayed close until the end of high school, and we still meet once a year to celebrate the day we saved the world from John Tucker. The girls all clink their coffee cups together in a toast INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY Lori walks to the front door.
70) 2) dialog: Mom turned out to be more mature than she thought... with a little help from me, of course. (CONTINUED)
70) 5) dialog: He’s easily the ugliest new dad I ever had, but he’s easily the best. (then) Who's left? Oh, right.
71) 0) text: Kate is running sprints while Scott times her. They’re th only people at the track.
71) 1) dialog: Scott was the luckiest one of all - he got me. And what about me? How did I turn out? Kate finishes running, catching her breath with her hands her hips. She walks along, then looks straight up into camera.
71) 2) dialog: I’m the girl who made John Tucker fall in love. I’m a legend. Kate smiles. FADE OUT.
