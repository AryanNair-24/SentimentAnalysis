11) 16) dialog: Kate had an idea.
11) 18) dialog: Exactly. Why is he getting off the hook? We could all date anyone, and for some reason we let him walk all over us.
11) 26) dialog: No, bigger. We're going to make him undateable, make it so no one wants to go out with him anymore. Carrie pulls out a huge sheath of color-coded papers and folders, hands a thick stack to each girl.
11) 27) dialog: I had some time to go over some possible approaches. I’11 bottom line it: he doesn’t know we’re on to him. We can use the fact that we’re his “girlfriends” to set him up, humiliate him, and make him look like a fool in front of the whole school.
11) 29) dialog: And we won’t just be taking care of him. We'll be sending a message to all the John Tuckers that we’re not going to put up with it anymore. They’re going to have to treat us with respect.

13) 24) dialog: What’s the matter? She’s an expert.
13) 26) dialog: All right, Kate’s right. We need to show people the real John Tucker. And to do that, we need a public platform - something where the whole school is there. That much I’ve already got figured out. Ladies and... ladies, I give you: the school election.
13) 29) dialog: Yes, the election, and he will run. Beth, you’re going to convince him.

15) 4) dialog: It’s a little late to be getting involved-
15) 6) dialog: (pretending to soften) You want my help? Well... (CONTINUED )
15) 10) dialog: What? John acts surprised, like he didn’t mean to let that slip out. He clearly did.
15) 12) dialog: No, it’s okay... He holds her hand, gazes into her eyes, then:
16) 2) dialog: Since we can’t be seen together. If he hears we're friends, he’1l know something's up. Come on, it’s not that bad. Carrie samples her food, shudders, gingerly returns the b to her napkin.

16) 33) dialog: Oh, we're not doing this to get glamor shots of Kate. Kate, speak into the cleavage. Carrie puts on a pair of headphones as Kate steps back up Heather.
16) 35) dialog: Okay, it’s good. There’s kind of an echo, but it’s good.
16) 37) dialog: Well, we want him to act like a sleazy horndog, so...
16) 41) dialog: Just my lists. You know, normal stuff, same aS everyone. (off their blank looks) I've got my “to do” list, which is subdivided into my “to do today,” “to do one time,” “to do weekly,” you know. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
16) 44) dialog: Then there's my “goals” list, again, “high school,” “college,” and “life;” my “contingency” lists in case one of my goals or to do items doesn’t work out the way I expected, my “observations,” my “notions,” which yes, are very different, and of course a few ideas for the screenplay I plan to write during my summer in Belize. Or Toronto, depending on the political climate. Don’t you all do this?
16) 46) dialog: Well, it works for me.
16) 48) dialog: You’re not going to freak me out that easily. I have a duplicate at home, and I copy the changes in every night.

19) 8) dialog: I’m just saying, I think I’d do a good job. I am the journalist here, I’ve done undercover stuff before-
19) 10) dialog: I do want to go, and not why you think. I mean, this is an amazing opportunity to see what guys really want. What they really think. Come on, throughout history, no one’s understood them - I’m about to get a glimpse into the heart of the male psyche.
