47) 21) text: David raises his hand.
47) 23) dialog: My name is David.  I do think it would be better to have some African-American writers but for whatever reason they are not here. I don't know if they couldn't find any people with experience, they wouldn't work for the pay or refused to work for the show.  I don't know and nobody in this room probably knows either.  I'm looking at this as a unique opportunity. We all should.  I'm a damn good writer and I'm ready to go to work.
47) 32) dialog: "Good Times" was better.  Kid Dy-no mite!!!
47) 37) dialog: And for reason.  Have you ever seen "Scream Blacula, Scream?"
