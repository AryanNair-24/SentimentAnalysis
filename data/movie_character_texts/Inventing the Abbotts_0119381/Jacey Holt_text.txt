They scurry out of the way as LLOYD ABBOTT pulls his 1957 Cadillac out of the driveway and cruises down the street. Lloyd is a well-dressed- and-fed man in his mid-forties. A Midwestern burgher, he exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent pillars of this community. Doug is embarrassed by Lloyd's passing, but Jacey evidently experiences a deeper humiliation -- he gives Doug a glance of betrayal, turns and walks down the block.

(She teaches second grade at Haley Elementary School.)

56) 8) text: Is there any sense, you think, in which Jacey has... oh, I don't know, it sounds ridiculous... corrupted Eleanor Abbott? Led her astray? Doug's mind works in several directions at once as he tries to figure out how much he should or could tell her.
56) 11) text: Well... jeez... I know that he's... that he's slept with her. But not because he's talked about it. I mean... Eleanor has lots of boyfriends. I think Jacey likes her more than she likes him.

61) 0) text: The party is well underway, it's a younger crowd tonight. The band plays "Fly Me To The Moon." Doug stands apart from the others. He's ill-at-ease. His conversation with Jacey resonates within him. As he looks over the gathering, he's pained to discover how easy it is to see things the way Jacey does: Lloyd holding court with a group of men in tuxedos... Joan Abbott propelling a reluctant Alice towards a group of guests Alice's age (Alice and Peter have separated)... and, finally, Pamela dancing with a handsome young man (TED). She is the belle of the ball, radiant and suddenly mature in her beautiful gown. She smiles as she sees Doug, excuses herself, and comes over to him. PAMELA

63) 7) dialog: Like hell you are.
63) 9) dialog: You're nuts. You'll never get accepted to Penn. Besides, Mom couldn't afford it anyway.
63) 11) dialog: I had a four-point-0 grade average and I couldn't get a scholarship -- so, I say you got your head up your ass. Jacey skillfully manipulates the volley and wins the game with a savage return that Doug is unable to counter. Jacey smiles, puts his paddle down, and walks out of the garage. Doug quickly picks up a ping-pong ball and hits it into the back of Jacey's head. Jacey turns and shoots a perturbed look at Doug -- Doug smiles:
67) 5) text: Pamela Louise Abbott... Pamela rises from her seat and takes her diploma. Lloyd and Joan Abbott applaud their daughter. Joan stands to take a snapshot. Alice is occupied with her restless and fussy eighteen-month-old daughter, Susan. Doug watches Pam return to her seat; she avoids his eyes. Helen is all smiles, this is a very special day for her. The chair next to her is empty. She glances behind her and sees Jacey standing in the back of the gym. Jacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom. He is only there at his mother's insistence. His eyes settle on... Alice Abbott. Alice tries to quiet her CRYING eighteen-month-old daughter (SUSAN). Lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to Alice and she rises and carries Susan up the aisle. Jacey's eyes follow Alice -- she notices his stare as she passes by with Susan in her arms.
68) 12) text: Jacey.
68) 14) text: Thank you, Lloyd. They pass each other and head their separate ways.   Thei chance meeting has not gone unobserved: Joan Abbott has been watching them from the front seat of Lloyd's brand-new 1959 Cadillac. She pretends to repair her lipstick with her compact mirror as Lloyd slips behind the wheel. And Helen finds Jacey frowning at her. He opens the door so that she can get into the Plymouth (Doug is already in the back seat). Jacey glares at Lloyd as he walks around the car and gets in behind the wheel. Lloyd flips down his sun visor (to block Jacey's glare) and pulls out of his parking spot.
69) 0) text: A waitress walks across the busy diner to Helen, Jacey, and Doug at their table. Helen and Doug are eating their desserts -- Jacey is content to brood over his cup of coffee. The waitress puts their bill on the table and steps away.

A party for the "Class of 1959" is underway (as a banner on the tent proclaims). The street is lined with parked cars and busy with late-coming guests. Doug checks the rearview mirror for Jacey's reaction, but his brother keeps his eyes on the road. HELEN

So if you're going to go to Philadelphia, you're on your own, dip shit. I don't need you riding my coat tails. Christ -- why don't you get your own life? Stop being my fucking shadow. Doug digests Jacey's insult, then scoops a ball of ice cream out of his bowl with his spoon and flings the gooey ice cream into the side of Jacey's face. Doug rises and goes to the front door.
71) 11) text: You little prick! Jacey hurls his BOWL at Doug -- it misses and SHATTERS on the wall. DOUG
71) 12) text: Missed me, peckerhead. As Doug opens the screen door Jacey dives into him -- they fall into the porch swing with such force that its chains rip out of the porch ceiling and Doug, Jacey, and the swing go overboard off the end of the porch into the shrubs.
71) 14) text: Doug?    Jacey? What was that? Doug and Jacey scramble to their feet, their clothes are ripped and disheveled. JACEY

Jacey chases after him, following him across the street. They pay no heed to Helen (in the b.g.) standing in their front yard, calling out to them:
73) 0) text: Helen sits in a lawn chair in the back yard wearing a large straw hat and reading a book. Doug and Jacey are repairing and painting the fence. Helen looks up from her book: HELEN
73) 1) text: That board doesn't look straight, Jacey. Come on, Doug, you've been painting the same spot for the last five minutes.
74) 0) text: Doug and Jacey clean their hands with turpentine. Doug picks up a ping-pong paddle and bounces the ball on it, trying to see how long he can keep it bouncing. Jacey finishes cleaning up, picks up a paddle, and then, without a word, Doug serves the ball and they begin to volley.
76) 0) text: Jacey sits at the counter at the rear of the busy diner sipping an iced tea. He sees Alice Abbott enter -- she pulls a dollar bill out of her purse as she approaches the cash register near the front door. She calls out to a waitress who is fetching an order from the grill. ALICE
76) 1) text: Excuse me -- could I get change for a dollar? The waitress is too distracted to take notice of Alice and Alice herself doesn't notice Jacey as he steps up behind her. JACEY
76) 4) text: Oh... you don't work here, do you? JACEY
76) 9) text: What?   Why? JACEY

109) 5) dialog: Dammit, where is she?!

109) 15) dialog: Come with me. Please, Alice, just come with me now, right now.
110) 0) text: Jacey haphazardly packs his suitcases. His emotions have been spent. Helen stands in the doorway.
110) 4) dialog: Because... the sooner I get out of this fucking town the better.
113) 6) text: Jacey was almost two and I was eight months pregnant with you and... well, some mornings I'd be crying before I even woke up. Then you were born. And Jacey just got lost in there. I didn't have anything for him. Mother took him over. He'd cry or call for me, and then I'd hear Mother answer him, and I'd go back to sleep. (sighs bitterly)
116) 0) text: A vintage, third-floor, railroad flat -- sparsely furnished and neat as a pin. Jacey is hosting a party. A TONY BENNETT record ("When Somebody Breaks Your Heart") plays on the hi-fi. The apartment is elbow-to-elbow with Penn men and attractive coeds from Radcliffe, Mt. Hollyoke, and Byrn Mawr. Doug sits in the middle of the sofa wedged between two coeds having separate, but equally animated conversations with two of Jacey's classmates (who are perched on the arms of the sofa). Doug wears a jacket and tie but his knack at looking out of place is intact. Jacey is apart from the others wooing a gorgeous CO-ED in a tight cashmere sweater.
116) 1) dialog: Airplanes, bridges, skyscrapers, bras, all utilize the same fundamentals of structural design... With his finger he traces the back strap of her bra beneath her sweater...
116) 4) dialog: A stable foundation that resists compression... His finger trails the shoulder strap of her bra...
116) 5) dialog: Carefully calculated suspension... He draws his fingertip around the outside of her breast to the lower front of her bra...
116) 6) dialog: And cantilevered elements to provide support. The Co-ed is bothered but none-the-less bewitched.
116) 8) dialog: So am I.
116) 11) dialog: I'm engaged in conversation with you. Jacey smiles and then kisses her. Doug is spying on them from the safety of the crowd. Jacey winks at Doug. Doug shakes his head in wonder.
133) 0) text: Jacey sits in his favorite armchair reading the Sunday newspaper. Doug sits in the middle of the sofa. Jacey scrutinizes his brooding younger brother.
133) 1) dialog: What's wrong with you?
133) 3) text: A boiling water KETTLE starts to WHISTLE (O.S.) -- Jacey goes into the kitchen to tend to it. There is a soft KNOCK on the front door. Doug goes to answer it. He opens the door and finds Pamela standing there with her coat in her hand. He is pleasantly surprised; Pam is distant, slightly off-balance.
133) 9) dialog: You want another cup of... Jacey steps out of the kitchen and frowns when he sees Pam.
133) 10) dialog: I told you not to come by on Sundays.
133) 12) dialog: Dammit, why didn't you call first?
133) 14) dialog: Well, I didn't expect to see you again. You want to fuck? I mean, that's why you came over, right?
133) 17) dialog: Then take off your clothes. Pamela drops her coat on the floor. She pulls her sweater off over her head. Doug's anguish is as great as Pamela's humiliation. He cannot bear any more if this -- he walks out the door.
135) 4) dialog: Doug... Doug turns and finds Jacey at the foot of the stairs.
135) 6) dialog: I didn't know.
135) 8) dialog: How you felt about Pam.
135) 10) dialog: I'm sorry.
135) 12) dialog: I did. (slight beat)
135) 15) dialog: I know.    I mean, I do now.
135) 17) dialog: Nothing.
135) 22) dialog: Right. Doug spins and delivers a wild, roundhouse punch that lands brutally on the side of Jacey's face -- the impact knocks him down onto the steps. Jacey's eyebrow has split open, he is blinded by blood.
145) 3) dialog: Mom...
146) 10) text: She had cancer. I just saw her Christmas. She was tired, but I thought she just had the flu or something. She didn't tell us. The hospital told Jacey when they called him. ELEANOR (slight beat)
146) 11) text: How is Jacey? DOUG
147) 0) text: The distance between Jacey and Doug is telling, as is the difference in their behavior. Doug leans against a wall with his hands in his pockets, his eyes cast down on his shoes. Jacey roams the alley unable to stand still for grief. He lights a fresh cigarette off the butt of another.
147) 1) dialog: Why?   Why didn't she tell us? The FUNERAL DIRECTOR appears in the back door:
148) 0) text: Helen's closed casket is surrounded by floral tributes. Doug and Jacey enter from a door near the casket -- they pause in reaction to the crowded parlor, it overflows with mourners. Jacey explodes under his breath, so that only Doug can hear:
148) 1) dialog: Fucking hypocrites -- every one of 'em. Jacey turns and walks out through the door they came in. Doug walks over to his seat in the front row -- he hesitates when he sees Lloyd Abbott standing in the back of the parlor.
149) 0) text: Doug sits at the table wrapping dishes in newspaper. Jacey comes in with a framed photograph of their grandmother.
149) 1) dialog: Do you want this picture of Grandma?

150) 3) dialog: Sure.
151) 0) text: Jacey and Doug are seated in a window booth.      They ea silence, then:

151) 6) dialog: About what?
151) 8) dialog: You going to stay here?   In Haley?
151) 10) dialog: (long beat)
151) 14) dialog: Hmmm?
151) 16) dialog: My eyebrow -- yeah, ten stitches.
151) 19) dialog: What is it?
151) 24) dialog: (re:   document)
151) 27) dialog: Jesus Christ... he sold the patent for a used car?

151) 31) dialog: (reading aloud)
151) 34) dialog: He parked it at the bottom of the lake.
152) 0) text: Doug follows Jacey to the door of the bus. Neither one of them knows how to say good-bye, after an awkward beat:
152) 4) dialog: (fighting back tears)
156) 25) text: I know that's what Jacey thinks. I could always tell by the way he looked at me -- even when he was a little boy -- like I owed him something. But, goddammit, he's wrong. That bet was your father's idea and I never meant your mother any harm. I would've done anything for her -- anything. I loved her. But the only thing she ever wanted from me was just for me to leave her alone. He pours himself a fresh drink, then turns to Doug:
