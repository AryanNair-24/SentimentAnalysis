She is an attractive but unostentatious woman without interest in appearing to be anything other than what she is: a forty-one-year-old widow raising two teenage sons on a school teacher's salary. (She teaches second grade at Haley Elementary School.)

He cocks his head to listen and slowly lowers the freezer lid. He peers into the silvery, dim light and sees Jacey and Eleanor naked on an old daybed near the coal bin in the back of the garage. She is on top of Jacey, riding him rhythmically. Eleanor is facing Doug. She reacts without alarm or shame when she notices Doug staring at her. She coolly returns his stare. Doug tries, but he's unable to avert his eyes.

30) 0) text: Doug steals lustful looks at Eleanor from behind his book. She is seated across the table from him. The library is filled with students poring over their assignments. Eleanor is seemingly oblivious to Doug's probing eyes. Doug allows his pencil to roll off the edge of the table. He ducks under the table to retrieve his pencil and his ruse is revealed as he stares up Eleanor's skirt at the soft triangle that her white panties cover between her parted legs. Eleanor's hand lowers a piece of notebook paper beneath the table, on it she has written: "Hi Doug!" Doug starts with panic, rears back, cracks his head on the bottom of the table, and then, as his head rebounds from the blow, he accidentally impales himself in his chin with the sharp pencil. Doug scrambles up from under the table with the pencil dangling from his chin, knocking over his chair in the process. The tranquility of the library is destroyed by the flabbergasted reactions of the students. Eleanor is momentarily concerned about his welfare, but she cannot help but laugh, too.

44) 0) text: Doug makes his way along the crowded corridor showing a few of his wounds from his emergency landing in the rose bush. He slows as he nears Pamela at her locker. She's aware of him, but pretends that she isn't. Doug hesitates as if he might say something to her, but loses his nerve and continues to mope along the hallway. Pam's disappointment is plain to see. Doug doesn't notice Eleanor and a few of her girl friends approaching in the opposite direction. As they pass him Eleanor smiles brightly and says:

56) 5) text: And why on earth should I believe anything you say, Joan? Joan is unable to find a quick retort, she gets into her station wagon and drives away. Helen notices a baseball lying in the gutter, she picks it up and cleans it off with her apron. As she turns to go back to the house, she finds Doug standing on the porch steps. Without warning, she expertly pitches the baseball across the yard to Doug -- it makes his hand sting when he catches it. Helen walks up to the porch. HELEN
56) 6) text: I'm going to ask you one question, Doug, and if you have no idea, or don't want to answer, just tell me. DOUG
56) 8) text: Is there any sense, you think, in which Jacey has... oh, I don't know, it sounds ridiculous... corrupted Eleanor Abbott? Led her astray? Doug's mind works in several directions at once as he tries to figure out how much he should or could tell her.
56) 14) text: Go finish your homework. Doug lobs the baseball back to her and goes inside. Helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that Joan's visit has taken on Helen becomes apparent -- a bone-weary sadness falls over her. Her "tranquility" is not borne of happiness, it is only a means of coping with the sadness that is at the core of her being.

His conversation with Jacey resonates within him. As he looks over the gathering, he's pained to discover how easy it is to see things the way Jacey does: Lloyd holding court with a group of men in tuxedos... Joan Abbott propelling a reluctant Alice towards a group of guests Alice's age (Alice and Peter have separated)... and, finally, Pamela dancing with a handsome young man (TED). She is the belle of the ball, radiant and suddenly mature in her beautiful gown. She smiles as she sees Doug, excuses herself, and comes over to him. PAMELA

61) 20) text: I accept your apology.   Let's dance. Doug allows Pam to pull him out onto the dance floor. He feels like a dolt, but she arranges his hands on her and they begin to dance. She gazes into his eyes and smiles: PAMELA
61) 21) text: Hi. DOUG
61) 22) text: Hi. Pam is in love with Doug, she has been since they were children. Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for her. For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble of true affinity. But their bubble begins to deflate as Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them. Her disapproval is unmistakable. Doug steers Pam around the dance floor to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting. Pamela senses the change in Doug's mood, but she is unaware of the cause. PAMELA
61) 23) text: Is Jacey home for the summer or is he just here for a visit? The mention of his brother's name at this exact moment sends a chill down Doug's spine.

61) 29) text: Hell -- you kidding? Even with Jacey working summers, my mom had to borrow against the house so he could go to Penn. I don't know where the money'll come from for me to go to college. Doug sees Joan Abbott prompting Ted to cut in on his dance with Pamela. Doug's bitterness swells. DOUG

64) 10) text: 'The Howard Lambert Scholarship in Scenic Design for the Theatre.' It's a full ride, four years. Pays everything almost. Hell, I could do that. Just have to figure out what scenic design is. Doug looks up from the brochure and comes face-to-face with a mannequin wearing a bra, girdle, and stockings. He almost flinches with surprise and blushes profusely:

Alice is occupied with her restless and fussy eighteen-month-old daughter, Susan. Doug watches Pam return to her seat; she avoids his eyes. Helen is all smiles, this is a very special day for her. The chair next to her is empty. She glances behind her and sees Jacey standing in the back of the gym. Jacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom. He is only there at his mother's insistence. His eyes settle on... Alice Abbott. Alice tries to quiet her CRYING eighteen-month-old daughter (SUSAN). Lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to Alice and she rises and carries Susan up the aisle. Jacey's eyes follow Alice -- she notices his stare as she passes by with Susan in her arms.
68) 8) text: And Doug -- he's going to...? HELEN
68) 14) text: Thank you, Lloyd. They pass each other and head their separate ways.   Thei chance meeting has not gone unobserved: Joan Abbott has been watching them from the front seat of Lloyd's brand-new 1959 Cadillac. She pretends to repair her lipstick with her compact mirror as Lloyd slips behind the wheel. And Helen finds Jacey frowning at her. He opens the door so that she can get into the Plymouth (Doug is already in the back seat). Jacey glares at Lloyd as he walks around the car and gets in behind the wheel. Lloyd flips down his sun visor (to block Jacey's glare) and pulls out of his parking spot.

A party for the "Class of 1959" is underway (as a banner on the tent proclaims). The street is lined with parked cars and busy with late-coming guests. Doug checks the rearview mirror for Jacey's reaction, but his brother keeps his eyes on the road. HELEN

So if you're going to go to Philadelphia, you're on your own, dip shit. I don't need you riding my coat tails. Christ -- why don't you get your own life? Stop being my fucking shadow. Doug digests Jacey's insult, then scoops a ball of ice cream out of his bowl with his spoon and flings the gooey ice cream into the side of Jacey's face. Doug rises and goes to the front door.

74) 0) text: Doug and Jacey clean their hands with turpentine. Doug picks up a ping-pong paddle and bounces the ball on it, trying to see how long he can keep it bouncing. Jacey finishes cleaning up, picks up a paddle, and then, without a word, Doug serves the ball and they begin to volley.

75) 1) text: Isn't that Pamela Abbott? In the distance Pamela struggles with a jack as she tries to remove a flat tire on her convertible. Doug grimaces as he recognizes her.
75) 5) text: Well, maybe Doug can give you a hand? Doug frowns and slowly climbs out of the Plymouth. DOUG
75) 10) text: Oh, I thought that was just the 'spare-tire-holder-on-er.' DOUG
75) 14) text: Pam, would you mind running Doug home? I'd like to get to the bank before they close.
75) 15) dialog: (protesting)
77) 0) text: Pamela sits behind the wheel of her convertible listening to PAT BOONE sing "April Love" on the car RADIO. Doug drips with sweat as he tightens the lugs on the spare tire. Pamela climbs out and inspects his progress.
77) 3) text: You think you'll finish sometime today? I'm getting sun stroke. DOUG
77) 5) text: Stop acting like Jacey. What makes you think you're so... cool? DOUG
77) 11) text: Name one bad thing I've ever done to you. DOUG
77) 13) text: Go on, name one bad thing. DOUG
77) 15) text: You tell me, because I don't get it! Look, I'm not rich, my father is. And I didn't pick my father. And if I had a choice between having tons of money or having another father, I'd be absolutely delighted to be poor! But unfortunately life is not a cafeteria! DOUG
77) 17) text: You know what I mean! DOUG
77) 19) text: Well, am I supposed to feel sorry for you 'cause you're so poor? DOUG
77) 21) text: So then just stop it! DOUG
77) 23) text: Stop treating me like an Abbott! DOUG
77) 27) text: Like you used to. Like just plain Pam. Doug exhales as if he's winding up to apologize. PAMELA
77) 28) text: And you don't have to say you're sorry, and you don't have to look like somebody just ran over your dog. You just make me want to scream sometimes. Doug stares at her as if he's never seen her before. PAMELA
77) 30) dialog: You.
82) 2) text: Who do you look like more, your father or your mother? DOUG
82) 4) text: Well, what did your father look like? DOUG

83) 0) text: Doug and Pamela sit on the ridge of the farmhouse roof (they climbed out of a dormer window from the attic). DOUG
83) 7) text: Yeah. It was sort of a dare, too. She dared me, I dared her, so we both did it. DOUG
83) 9) text: Night. DOUG
83) 11) text: I don't remember. DOUG
83) 13) text: We just walked around the yard. DOUG

83) 17) text: Does it matter? DOUG
83) 19) text: Okay. DOUG
83) 25) text: Hi. DOUG
83) 27) text: Really? DOUG
83) 28) text: Yup. Pamela takes his hand, gently unfolds it, and with her index finger she writes on his palm, "I love you." Telling him took all the nerve she could muster, she hasn't the stamina for a disappointing response -- she places her fingers on his lips to silence him. Doug leans over and kisses her, sweetly and tenderly, and for a long time. They will always remember this kiss.
88) 0) text: Helen leans out a bus window and calls to Doug, who is perched on the front fender of the Plymouth, which is parked nearby with Jacey behind the wheel.
88) 2) dialog: Okay, Mom, okay.

89) 4) dialog: She does? PAMELA
89) 6) dialog: What do they teach you at stewardess school?
89) 8) dialog: Maybe you should go there instead of Bryn Mawr? She pushes harder against his feet and her foot slips off his and clobbers him in the crotch. He moans and sits up.
89) 9) dialog: Oww!   Damn!
89) 11) dialog: Watch it.
89) 19) text: I'm not tired of kissing.    Are you? DOUG
89) 21) text: We are touching. DOUG
89) 25) text: No, I know what I look like without any clothes on -- I look naked. DOUG

90) 1) dialog: Hey... hold up!
90) 3) dialog: Hell, I didn't know. What does this got to do with us?
90) 5) dialog: Why is it okay for you to sneak around with me, but it's not all right for Alice to sneak around with Jacey?
90) 10) dialog: Come on, take it easy.
90) 12) dialog: Eleanor fooled around with lots of guys, it's not Jacey's fault your dad kicked her out.
90) 14) dialog: (taken aback)
90) 17) dialog: Oh, shit.

92) 7) dialog: Christ, why do you have to take care of them?
92) 13) dialog: Okay.   Sure.   See you around. Pam's composure begins to weaken, but she quickly returns to the car before she can lose control. Doug turns the hose back on. He doesn't look up as she drives away.
94) 0) text: Helen approaches the foot of the stairs drying her hands with a dish towel. She listens for a beat, then steps out on the front porch. Doug is brushing a coat of green enamel on the repaired porch swing.

103) 10) dialog: (puzzled) Had to what? What?
112) 0) text: Doug and Helen sit across from each other, neither one has much of an appetite. They eat in silence for a few moments, then:
112) 1) dialog: Dammit... why can't he just leave them alone?
112) 3) dialog: The Abbotts. I don't know why... why couldn't he just forget 'em? Just pretend they didn't even exist?
113) 0) text: Helen carries her plate to the sink.   Doug follows her in.
113) 1) dialog: What do you mean, how do you know? She sits at the kitchen table and sighs as if coming around to some central, hard truth.
113) 7) text: I should've taken us away from here, gone somewhere else. DOUG
113) 9) text: After Charlie died Lloyd Abbott started dropping by on his way home from work. He felt so bad about that bet Charlie made with him at the lake. That foolish, idiotic bet. Poor Lloyd -- I felt sorry for him. He'd have a cup of coffee with Mother and me. If a doorknob had come off he'd fix it. He'd carry the garbage cans to the curb. Someone dies, people try to be helpful. But he was by here so often that people started to talk. It was fairly obvious that he wanted something more from me than just a cup of coffee. I suggested that he didn't need to stop by here so often, but... then one afternoon I was at Woolworth's, having lunch at the counter. All of sudden Joan Abbott was standing there -- screaming and yelling at me to stop sleeping with her husband, with Lloyd. I was speechless. She was gone before I could find my tongue. DOUG (stunned; almost ill)
113) 15) dialog: Dammit, why didn't Lloyd tell her that nothing had happened?
113) 17) dialog: Ahhh, Jesus... but why? Why did everyone in town believe Joan Abbott?
113) 19) dialog: I hate this town. I hate the Abbotts. He slaps the back of a chair and knocks it over.
113) 21) dialog: I already knew.
113) 23) dialog: No, I've never heard anyone talk about it. Not to me.
113) 25) dialog: Jacey.
113) 29) dialog: Yeah. But he thinks it really happened. Helen is overcome with tears. Doug stares at her helplessly. He's never seen his mother weep before.

The apartment is elbow-to-elbow with Penn men and attractive coeds from Radcliffe, Mt. Hollyoke, and Byrn Mawr. Doug sits in the middle of the sofa wedged between two coeds having separate, but equally animated conversations with two of Jacey's classmates (who are perched on the arms of the sofa). Doug wears a jacket and tie but his knack at looking out of place is intact. Jacey is apart from the others wooing a gorgeous CO-ED in a tight cashmere sweater.
117) 2) dialog: Hey!   Hey!   Pam! Pamela Abbott walks across the quad. Pam is 19 years old now, her beauty in full bloom. Doug jogs over to her.

117) 10) dialog: How's Bryn Mawr?

117) 14) dialog: Why not?   It's been a long time.
117) 16) dialog: (re: her figure)
117) 20) dialog: What party? The traffic light changes and the other pedestrians cross the street.
117) 22) dialog: Just call -- I'm at Reed Hall.
117) 26) dialog: Bye. Doug watches her cross the street.
118) 0) text: Doug is revising a set design -- deeply concentrating on his task. He's startled by a KNOCK on the door. MALE STUDENT (O.S.)
119) 0) text: Doug comes down the wide stairs with a puzzled look on his face. He stops at the front desk and the student clerk points to another part of the lobby. Doug walks across the cavernous lobby and finds Pamela Abbott slumped in a chair.
119) 1) dialog: Did you miss the bus? Pam laughs and Doug suddenly realizes:
119) 2) dialog: Damn, you're drunk. Awww, man... I better get you out of here before the Puritans tar-and-feather you. Can you walk? Pam awkwardly rises and Doug guides her to the door.
119) 3) dialog: Listen to me -- go out the front door, turn right, go around to the side of the building and wait for me by the fire escape. Okay? Just wait.
120) 0) text: Pamela leans against the side of the building as the fire escape ladder descends to the pavement. Doug climbs down.

121) 0) text: Pam sits on the bed as Doug pulls her stained turtleneck sweater off over her head (she's wearing a bra).
121) 1) dialog: What were you drinking, Sterno?
121) 3) dialog: Hold on, we got to get your pants too. Can you stand up. (as she collapses on the bed))

125) 5) dialog: Oh-Jesus-did-we what?
125) 7) dialog: What do you think?
125) 9) dialog: Goddammit. Well, I know you might find this hard to believe, but I don't sleep with drunks.
126) 0) text: Doug lounges on his bed reading a textbook. It is raining outside. He is startled by a TAPPING on the windowpane. Pamela is outside on the fire escape. He ignores her.
126) 5) dialog: If you feel like you're gonna puke use the wastebasket there.
126) 8) dialog: You want to hear something stupid?
126) 10) dialog: When I was cleaning you up, wiping the puke off your face, I suddenly realized how much I miss you -- how much I love you. How's that for stupid? Pam is stung by his flippancy, she begins to cry.
126) 11) dialog: What are you crying for?
126) 13) dialog: Why?
126) 18) dialog: No, no, it's not too late. It's perfect timing. We're on our own now. No Jacey and Eleanor or Jacey and Alice. That's what stinks about being the youngest, we have to sweep up after everybody else. But now it's just us. It's our turn.
126) 20) dialog: How can you be in love with me?
126) 22) dialog: Hi.
126) 24) dialog: You want to see something?
126) 26) dialog: Come on.
128) 4) dialog: I want to show you something. He escorts her up a short flight of steps and positions her center stage near the footlights.
128) 5) dialog: Just stand right there. He takes the work light with him as he walks off stage. Then with a METALLIC CLANK everything goes dark.
128) 7) text: Doug!
128) 8) dialog: It's all right -- don't move! Stay put. There's the RUMBLE and SQUEAK of a piece of SCENERY being rolled onto stage -- then the SWOOSH of a backdrop being lowered from the fly loft.
128) 9) dialog: Almost, almost... hold on. We hear Doug RUNNING somewhere backstage then a beautiful sunset slowly illuminates the stage -- creating the perfect mood for the modestly scaled stylized set that Doug has put into place: It is the roof of a weathered farmhouse with a dormer window and a tall brick chimney. Doug steps on stage, he's a bit winded from his quick- change routine.
128) 11) dialog: The senior acting class does scenes from different plays, they invite everybody, it's a real big deal. So, there's this competition among all the theater design students to do the sets. And -- anyway -- I'm the one whose design got picked.
128) 15) dialog: (a tad embarrassed)
128) 16) text: Umm... Romeo and Juliet. It's something different, I think that's why they picked it. Everybody else was doing castles and stuff. Rooftop Romeo and Juliet by Douglas L. Holt.
128) 18) dialog: It's like building models when I was a kid. It's fun. It's... make-believe.
128) 20) dialog: Oh, no.     Did they?
128) 22) dialog: They always tear down the wrong stuff.
128) 24) dialog: Missed you, too. They kiss -- then Pamela pulls away.    Doug studies her, then:
128) 25) dialog: You have a boyfriend, right?
128) 27) dialog: Well, what? You worried what your old man would think?
128) 31) dialog: Then what's the problem?
128) 33) dialog: Why not? I mean... okay. We don't have to go so fast. Shit, I'm sorry. I blew it again, huh?
128) 35) dialog: How? Pam climbs down off the stage and starts up the aisle.
128) 37) dialog: What about tomorrow? I could come up in the afternoon and...
128) 39) dialog: Pam!   It's not too late!

133) 8) dialog: How did you know I was here?
134) 0) text: Doug comes out of the apartment house and walks up the sidewalk. Tears begins to stream down his face. He begins to run and run as fast as he can.

135) 7) dialog: You didn't know what?!
135) 9) dialog: Fuck you.
135) 11) dialog: Apologize to her, you asshole!
135) 14) dialog: She didn't betray Alice! She was just trying to get rid of you so Alice wouldn't try to kill herself again. Jesus Christ, you shit- head, Alice couldn't marry you!
135) 16) dialog: Then what the hell did Pam ever do to deserve your revenge?
135) 21) dialog: Just your way of evening the score with Lloyd Abbott, right?
135) 23) dialog: I don't know   you! I don't know who the fuck   you are! You fuck everything.    You fuck everything up! Why did    you have to fuck Pam, too?! Doug walks away, leaving Jacey sitting on the steps, clutching a banister for support. He presses his palm to his eyebrow to squelch the flow of blood.

141) 9) dialog: I guess that free-lance drafting job was too good for him to turn down.
141) 11) dialog: No. Doug wants to avoid the topic of Jacey.    He opens the refrigerator.
141) 12) dialog: When did you start drinking beer?
141) 15) dialog: Here.   Have one with me.

148) 0) text: Helen's closed casket is surrounded by floral tributes. Doug and Jacey enter from a door near the casket -- they pause in reaction to the crowded parlor, it overflows with mourners. Jacey explodes under his breath, so that only Doug can hear:

149) 2) dialog: You can have it.

151) 7) dialog: I should live my own life. Stop being your shadow. I'm not like you, Jacey -- I don't want to be like you.
151) 9) dialog: No. I was thinking New York. If I'm going to really learn how to design sets, that's the place to do it.
151) 12) dialog: I know you are. (slight beat)
151) 15) dialog: Your eyebrow.
151) 17) dialog: Sorry. Doug takes an envelope out of his coat pocket and puts it on the table.
151) 18) dialog: Found this in one of the boxes in the basement.
151) 20) dialog: A letter of agreement between Lloyd Abbott and Dad. Dad sold him the file drawer patent -- not Mom.
151) 26) dialog: Yup.
151) 28) dialog: Used cars were the only kind of cars around. The war was on -- everything was mobilized. They stopped making new cars, they were making tanks and bombers in Detroit. And even Midwest Steel wasn't making desks, they were making ammo boxes and mortar shells.
151) 30) dialog: U.S. History -- high school. I should be an expert, I had to take the damn class twice. I guess Dad needed a car and he figured who- the-hell needed a full-suspension file drawer?
151) 33) dialog: Wonder whatever happened to it?
152) 0) text: Doug follows Jacey to the door of the bus. Neither one of them knows how to say good-bye, after an awkward beat:

154) 0) text: A "For Sale" sign has been placed on the front yard. Doug pulls up the driveway in the Plymouth. He turns OFF the ENGINE but doesn't get out of the car. Then he STARTS the CAR again and backs out of the driveway.
155) 0) text: Despite it being a birthday party for a three-year-old, this is very much a grown-up affair. The band is playing, the adults are dancing, Joan Abbott is flitting from guest-to-guest, Alice is dutifully silent while Peter dominates the talk at their table, Lloyd is with his cronies.
