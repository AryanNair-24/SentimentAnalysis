16) 17) text: Well, I think this is called the silent treatment. I get enough of that from my father, I don't need it from you. Good luck at Penn. She starts to walk away, but Jacey pulls her back and kisses her fiercely -- Eleanor responds with equal heat. They don't see Pamela enter the garage. Pam studies them for an imperturbable beat, then: PAMELA

36) 25) dialog: About what?   What? What? DOUG
36) 26) text: Why are we talking about Eleanor? PAMELA
36) 29) dialog: Both. Doug exhales with bewilderment, stubs out his cigarette, then awkwardly slides down the sofa to Pamela. She holds perfectly still as Doug slowly moves his mouth to hers and kisses her. Then he concludes the kiss to check her reaction; she timidly smiles. He kisses her again with greater fervor. Doug creeps his hand up her blouse and massages her breast. Pamela struggles to suppress her surprise, which he mistakes as a sign of her approval. Emboldened by her lack of resistance, he slips his hand under her bra. Pam is shocked by the pleasure of the sensation, then alarmed by the pace of their passion.
36) 30) dialog: Doug... Doug kisses her again and as they kiss he stares at a framed photograph of Eleanor amongst an assortment of family photos on the long table behind the sofa. It is Eleanor that he is thinking of -- in his mind's eye it is Eleanor's breast that he is fondling. Pamela pulls her lips from his:

She's aware of him, but pretends that she isn't. Doug hesitates as if he might say something to her, but loses his nerve and continues to mope along the hallway. Pam's disappointment is plain to see. Doug doesn't notice Eleanor and a few of her girl friends approaching in the opposite direction. As they pass him Eleanor smiles brightly and says:

58) 12) text: Happy birthday. PAMELA
61) 0) text: The party is well underway, it's a younger crowd tonight. The band plays "Fly Me To The Moon." Doug stands apart from the others. He's ill-at-ease. His conversation with Jacey resonates within him. As he looks over the gathering, he's pained to discover how easy it is to see things the way Jacey does: Lloyd holding court with a group of men in tuxedos... Joan Abbott propelling a reluctant Alice towards a group of guests Alice's age (Alice and Peter have separated)... and, finally, Pamela dancing with a handsome young man (TED). She is the belle of the ball, radiant and suddenly mature in her beautiful gown. She smiles as she sees Doug, excuses herself, and comes over to him. PAMELA
61) 3) dialog: Are you okay?
61) 5) dialog: Yes, I am.    Come on, dance with me. She pulls him towards the dance floor. DOUG
61) 6) text: You didn't tell me I had to dance. PAMELA
61) 8) text: What am I supposed to be so sorry about? PAMELA
61) 10) text: All right, yeah, I'm sorry. PAMELA
61) 15) text: You always do this to me. PAMELA
61) 17) text: I'm sorry for what I'm supposed to be sorry about. Okay? PAMELA
61) 19) text: Oh, shit, come on, Pam. Dammit. For crying out loud. Forget it. PAMELA
61) 20) text: I accept your apology.   Let's dance. Doug allows Pam to pull him out onto the dance floor. He feels like a dolt, but she arranges his hands on her and they begin to dance. She gazes into his eyes and smiles: PAMELA
61) 22) text: Hi. Pam is in love with Doug, she has been since they were children. Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for her. For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble of true affinity. But their bubble begins to deflate as Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them. Her disapproval is unmistakable. Doug steers Pam around the dance floor to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting. Pamela senses the change in Doug's mood, but she is unaware of the cause. PAMELA
61) 27) text: It's cheaper if he stays here for the summer. He can save more money for school, 'cause he doesn't have to pay rent. Money's tight, you know, we're sort of poor. PAMELA
61) 29) text: Hell -- you kidding? Even with Jacey working summers, my mom had to borrow against the house so he could go to Penn. I don't know where the money'll come from for me to go to college. Doug sees Joan Abbott prompting Ted to cut in on his dance with Pamela. Doug's bitterness swells. DOUG
61) 30) text: I hear Alice and Peter are getting a divorce. PAMELA
61) 32) text: What's the difference? PAMELA
61) 34) text: So, where's Eleanor tonight? PAMELA
61) 37) dialog: No!    Who said that?
61) 44) text: Excuse me, asshole, but... Doug spins and slugs Ted in the jaw -- sending him reeling into the other dancers. Everyone pulls away from Doug and Pam. Doug massages his fist and looks helplessly at Pamela: DOUG
67) 5) text: Pamela Louise Abbott... Pamela rises from her seat and takes her diploma. Lloyd and Joan Abbott applaud their daughter. Joan stands to take a snapshot. Alice is occupied with her restless and fussy eighteen-month-old daughter, Susan. Doug watches Pam return to her seat; she avoids his eyes. Helen is all smiles, this is a very special day for her. The chair next to her is empty. She glances behind her and sees Jacey standing in the back of the gym. Jacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom. He is only there at his mother's insistence. His eyes settle on... Alice Abbott. Alice tries to quiet her CRYING eighteen-month-old daughter (SUSAN). Lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to Alice and she rises and carries Susan up the aisle. Jacey's eyes follow Alice -- she notices his stare as she passes by with Susan in her arms.
75) 1) text: Isn't that Pamela Abbott? In the distance Pamela struggles with a jack as she tries to remove a flat tire on her convertible. Doug grimaces as he recognizes her.
75) 7) dialog: What thing? DOUG
75) 9) text: This. PAMELA
75) 11) text: Read your manual. Pamela would slug him if his mother wasn't present.

77) 0) text: Pamela sits behind the wheel of her convertible listening to PAT BOONE sing "April Love" on the car RADIO. Doug drips with sweat as he tightens the lugs on the spare tire. Pamela climbs out and inspects his progress.
77) 4) text: Put the top up. PAMELA
77) 6) text: Because -- I know all the answers on 'The $64,000 Question,' because I have X-ray vision and I can sing better than Pat Boone. And because I'm really a negro, but don't tell anyone around here, 'cause you know what would happen to me. PAMELA
77) 12) text: Why? PAMELA
77) 14) text: What's the point? PAMELA
77) 16) text: Life is not a cafeteria? PAMELA
77) 18) text: Shit, I'm supposed to feel sorry for you 'cause you're rich? PAMELA
77) 20) text: No. PAMELA
77) 22) text: Stop what?! PAMELA
77) 27) text: Like you used to. Like just plain Pam. Doug exhales as if he's winding up to apologize. PAMELA
77) 28) text: And you don't have to say you're sorry, and you don't have to look like somebody just ran over your dog. You just make me want to scream sometimes. Doug stares at her as if he's never seen her before. PAMELA
82) 3) text: Hell, I don't know. PAMELA
82) 10) text: You never heard about that? PAMELA
82) 12) text: Well, it was sort of a car wreck. He drowned, or froze to death, or both, I don't know. He was trying to drive out to Mud Island. PAMELA
82) 14) text: It was winter time, the lake was froze over. PAMELA
83) 0) text: Doug and Pamela sit on the ridge of the farmhouse roof (they climbed out of a dormer window from the attic). DOUG
83) 1) text: I think my dad was like Jacey is. Some guys are just dare-devils. I bet Jacey once that he couldn't do a back-flip off the garage roof into a big pile of leaves. And he did it. PAMELA (slight beat)
83) 6) text: You did? PAMELA
83) 8) text: Was this day or night? PAMELA
83) 10) text: Was there a full moon? PAMELA
83) 12) text: You walked around the yard or did you like run from tree to tree? PAMELA
83) 14) text: Front yard or back yard? PAMELA
83) 16) text: Oh. PAMELA
83) 18) text: Yeah. Back yard nudity is hypocritical. It's insincere. People should do and say exactly what they feel or think and not try to hide things. PAMELA
83) 24) text: Hi. PAMELA
83) 26) text: You look pretty. PAMELA
83) 28) text: Yup. Pamela takes his hand, gently unfolds it, and with her index finger she writes on his palm, "I love you." Telling him took all the nerve she could muster, she hasn't the stamina for a disappointing response -- she places her fingers on his lips to silence him. Doug leans over and kisses her, sweetly and tenderly, and for a long time. They will always remember this kiss.
89) 0) text: Doug and Pamela lounge on opposite ends of the sofa with his bare feet pressed against hers in a gentle shoving match. They are watching an episode of "Sea Hunt" on the TELEVISION.
89) 1) dialog: How long is your mom gone?
89) 3) dialog: Eleanor lives in Chicago.
89) 7) dialog: I don't know.    How to wiggle your bottom.
89) 10) dialog: Sorry.
89) 12) dialog: It was an accident. Don't be crabby. She pulls him down on top of her. She kisses the tip of his nose then blows his bangs off his forehead.
89) 17) dialog: No. DOUG
89) 18) text: I just thought maybe you were tired of just kissing? PAMELA
89) 20) text: No, but touching is nice. PAMELA
89) 23) dialog: Doug! DOUG
89) 24) text: Aren't you curious? PAMELA
89) 27) dialog: Jesus. DOUG
89) 28) text: Just on the outside? PAMELA
89) 34) dialog: I like your lips, block-head. I like being here like this. But I'm not taking my clothes off, 'cause if we do that, you know what we'll do. And I'm too... I don't want to be like my sisters. Not if I can help it. They kiss but are almost instantly interrupted by the SLAM of the SCREEN DOOR. Doug looks up and does a surprised take as he sees Alice going up the stairs followed by Jacey.
89) 36) dialog: Who is it?
89) 38) dialog: With Eleanor?
90) 0) text: Pamela rushes out of the house with her shoes in her hand. Doug chases after her in his bare feet.
90) 2) dialog: Why didn't you tell me?
90) 4) dialog: My God... what is she doing?
90) 9) dialog: Because I'm not Alice! And you're not Jacey! Alice is... is like my mom, they both get hurt so easy, they're like turtles without shells.
90) 11) dialog: You don't know my father. You don't know how he is about Jacey. He blames him for everything that happened with Eleanor.
90) 13) dialog: Oh, Jesus! He didn't kick her out, he put her in a nut house! He shipped her off to this clinic in Wisconsin.
90) 16) dialog: She is now.     They let her out a month ago.
90) 18) dialog: Yeah.   Shit.
91) 22) dialog: She's talking to me, Daddy. Pamela rises from a wrought iron bench in another part of the yard -- she strolls over to Alice.
91) 23) dialog: Just girl talk.
92) 0) text: Doug hoses down the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. Pamela pulls up in her car and gets out.
92) 2) dialog: Hi.
92) 4) dialog: I've been thinking -- maybe we shouldn't see each other right now.
92) 6) dialog: Well... if my father... I don't really care what would happen to me if he found out I was seeing you, but I have to take care of Alice and my mother and Eleanor, and... well, it would be hard for me to do that if I were in the doghouse, too. You know?
92) 11) dialog: (shrugs)
99) 0) text: It is almost two o'clock in the morning. Helen has dozed off in her chair with a book on her lap. She is startled awake by a loud BANGING at the front door. Helen hurries to the door and opens it. Pamela is on the porch. She is out of breath and very distraught. Her CAR is parked in the middle of the street with its lights on and MOTOR RUNNING.
99) 2) dialog: I need to talk to... Jacey comes down the stairs, pulling on his bathrobe. Doug appears on the stairs behind him.
99) 4) dialog: Alice took some pills, some of my mother's pills...
99) 6) dialog: She's all right, we took her to the hospital...
99) 8) dialog: No!
99) 10) dialog: No. That's why she sent me, she doesn't want you to come, she was afraid you would if you heard from someone else. She's all right.
99) 14) dialog: They just want her to rest tonight, they said they might let her come home in a day or two. She just needs to rest. I've got to go, I'm supposed to be on my way home from the hospital.
99) 16) dialog: Dammit, no! I'm warning you, just wait! I'll let you know just as soon as she can see you. Please, don't make things worse. Don't.
100) 0) text: Pamela dashes back to her car.
103) 3) dialog: She's all right.
103) 5) dialog: At the boathouse -- at the lake.
103) 9) dialog: I had to... for Alice's sake.
103) 11) dialog: Tell Jacey I'm sorry.
117) 7) dialog: Hi.
117) 9) dialog: I come down to use the library sometimes or go shopping.
117) 11) dialog: Very... Bryn.    I got to catch the bus back.
117) 13) dialog: I can't.   Sorry.
117) 15) dialog: You seem taller.
117) 19) dialog: I can't.   I have to go to this party.
117) 21) dialog: Just a party I got roped into going. Maybe some other time, okay? I mean it, really.
117) 25) dialog: Okay.   Bye.
119) 0) text: Doug comes down the wide stairs with a puzzled look on his face. He stops at the front desk and the student clerk points to another part of the lobby. Doug walks across the cavernous lobby and finds Pamela Abbott slumped in a chair.

125) 6) dialog: Did we... do it?
125) 8) dialog: I... don't... remember...
125) 11) dialog: Doug?    Hey!
126) 0) text: Doug lounges on his bed reading a textbook. It is raining outside. He is startled by a TAPPING on the windowpane. Pamela is outside on the fire escape. He ignores her.
126) 4) dialog: Doug! Open the window!     Come on, I'm freezing. Doug...! He gets out of bed, unlatches the window, then returns to the bed and his book. Pamela opens the window (with difficulty) and climbs in. She drapes her wet coat over the radiator and sits in the desk chair.
126) 6) dialog: I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I was embarrassed. I didn't know where I was when I woke up. I felt like I was dying, so, I just... I was going to call you. Doug doesn't respond -- he turns the page of his book.
126) 7) dialog: I don't know... I was blotto. I mean, I was so happy to see you. Then I just got sad. I got sad. And stupid. It happens, you know? Doug snaps his book shut.
126) 9) dialog: What?
126) 12) dialog: I love you.   But it's too late.
126) 17) dialog: Everything's too screwed up. Doug kneels in front of her and anxiously tries to console her.
126) 19) dialog: How can you be in love with me?
126) 21) dialog: 'Cause I've always have been. You... block-head. He kisses her, then he gazes at her and strokes her hair.

128) 17) dialog: You're really good at this.
128) 19) dialog: You know, they tore that old farmhouse down?
128) 21) dialog: Yeah.
128) 23) dialog: Oh, Jesus, I missed you -- so much.
128) 26) dialog: No.
128) 30) dialog: He doesn't care what I do, as long as I don't do it in Haley.
128) 32) dialog: I can't... do this.
128) 34) dialog: No, I did.
128) 36) dialog: I'm on probation. They pulled a bed-check the night I was here. I have to be back in the dorm by ten. Gotta go.
128) 38) dialog: No! It's just too late. It's all messed up. I can't seem to make things all right. The more I try the worse everything gets. I'm sorry. Pam walks up the aisle and disappears through a door to the lobby.

133) 3) text: A boiling water KETTLE starts to WHISTLE (O.S.) -- Jacey goes into the kitchen to tend to it. There is a soft KNOCK on the front door. Doug goes to answer it. He opens the door and finds Pamela standing there with her coat in her hand. He is pleasantly surprised; Pam is distant, slightly off-balance.
133) 5) dialog: Hi.
133) 11) dialog: I forgot. The breath goes out of Doug as if he'd been struck in the stomach.
133) 13) dialog: Didn't have any nickels.

160) 1) text: Pamela comes out of the store via the revolving door and finds Doug waiting for her on the sidewalk.

160) 4) dialog: Ever... forgive me?
160) 6) dialog: Yeah.
160) 8) dialog: But... oh, Jesus... how do we start all over again? Pam's eyes fill with tears. Doug steps over to her and embraces her tenderly, holding her close.
