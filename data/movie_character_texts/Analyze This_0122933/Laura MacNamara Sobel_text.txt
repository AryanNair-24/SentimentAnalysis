24) 0) text: LAURA MacNAMARA, a pretty and charming TV news correspondent, is on the air live, surrounded by her camera crew. Kids are frolicking in the pool, splashing off the water slide behind her.
24) 3) dialog: So judging from the mob scene around the pool here today, I think you'd have to say that there's nothing 'off' about the 'off-season' in Miami Beach this summer. Now, on a personal note, this is my last report for W.V.B.F. I'm getting married to a wonderful man and moving to New York, so if you're up that way, watch for me on the W.P.I.X. news team. Thanks for everything, Miami. (voice catching slightly) For the last time, this is Laura MacNamara, W.V.B.F. news.
24) 5) dialog: Catch!
24) 8) text: Laura's smile abruptly disappears.
24) 9) dialog: (to the crew, all business) I'll do the re-asks, then you guys can just shoot the inserts and pack it up. (looks off) Ben!
24) 10) text: Laura runs to Ben, standing on the sidelines, and embraces him. Michael is there too.
24) 11) dialog: This is him, everyone!    This is the guy!
24) 15) dialog: (as she hugs him) Oh, I missed you.
24) 18) dialog: (a little too big) This is Michael? I don't think so. If I remember correctly, Michael was a little boy, and this, this is a great big kid. Hey, you. Tell us what you did with Michael Sobol.
24) 20) dialog: Okay. Come on. Give me a break. I'm trying.
24) 22) dialog: (smiles appreciatively) Sorry. Just smack me if I do that again. (hugs him) How are you, Michael?
24) 31) dialog: Go ahead. If you break something, don't worry. I'm out of here.
24) 33) dialog: You think he likes me?
24) 36) dialog: You are? And you still really want to get married?
24) 38) dialog: But what if you get tired of me? I know so many couples that were really happy, then they got married and just completely lost interest in each other.
24) 40) dialog: I just don't want to lose the passion.
24) 44) dialog: I want us to be like animals. You know just screaming and sweating and tearing at each other all the time --

29) 1) dialog: What is wrong with you? I woke up, you were gone, no note or anything. I've been going out of my mind, Ben. I walked all over the hotel looking for you. I almost called the police!
29) 3) dialog: You have patients in Florida?
29) 5) dialog: Who is this patient?
29) 11) dialog: (worried) Oh, Ben.
29) 13) dialog: You're not going to treat him.
29) 15) dialog: Tell me you're not.
29) 17) dialog: That would be too scary. You don't want a person like that in your life, believe me. I've covered the mob down here. I've seen what they can do.
29) 19) dialog: You sure?
29) 21) dialog: (tearing up) I was so worried.
32) 2) dialog: (to Ben) Come on. Get into it.
32) 4) dialog: Just stop. (to Michael) We're having fun, right?
37) 0) text: Laura's family, the MacNamaras, and a few close friends have gathered for the rehearsal dinner.

37) 25) text: Laura glares at Ben.
37) 29) dialog: (stunned) Thank you very much.
37) 44) text: Vitti takes an envelope from his jacket pocket and presses it into Laura's hand.
37) 48) dialog: Mr. Vitti, we can't accept this.
37) 50) dialog: Okay. Then you leave us alone, right?
37) 54) dialog: I've never been less okay.
37) 56) text: Ben is yanked away by Jimmy.     Marie stands with Laura.

42) 3) dialog: (sotto)
42) 6) dialog: Oh.
47) 22) text: Suddenly Laura bursts into the room, still in her wedding dress, but disheveled.
47) 24) dialog: (distraught, to Vitti) How could you do that?
47) 29) dialog: Why, they're going to throw me off the balcony, too? (to Vitti) I am thirty -- over thirty years old and all my life I have dreamed of walking down the aisle in a beautiful white dress and marrying the man I love.
47) 31) dialog: Thank you, but it's not about the dress! We were supposed to get married!
47) 33) dialog: Of course I'm upset! (to Ben) I'm going downstairs to pack, then I'm going to New York and I'm getting married with you or without you. Okay?
50) 0) text: Ben, Laura and Michael are staring up at the elaborate fountain that now fills the back yard.
50) 5) text: Michael crosses away.    Laura glares at Ben.
50) 7) dialog: Well, we're not married, so I guess we'll have to send it back.
50) 9) dialog: What did you expect? You think that's what I want to remember on our anniversary? 'Gee, honey, let's go look at the wedding video. There's my parents, there's your parents, and there's the guy who plunged to his death.'
50) 11) dialog: I'm starting to think that's not going to happen.
50) 16) dialog: And who's going to be there?
50) 18) dialog: And no guests without necks. Everybody has to have a neck.
51) 0) text: The back door opens and Ben, Laura and Michael enter, struggling with the luggage. They freeze. Sitting in the family room are the three FBI agents: Steadman, Ricci and Provano.
51) 4) text: Laura recognizes Provano from the hotel and glares at him.
51) 17) dialog: Was your patient.
51) 19) dialog: But not like a real patient.
51) 23) dialog: Yeah, maybe you should.
51) 34) dialog: Too bad you didn't remember that when you were breaking in.
51) 36) dialog: (firmly) No.
53) 0) text: Ben comes back to Laura and the Agents.
53) 8) dialog: A bloodbath?
53) 15) dialog: (tough) Okay. Guess what, fellas? You don't scare me.
53) 17) dialog: Sit down! (to the Agents) There's going to be a bloodbath. Oh, yeah. Only it's going to be between you and me. You think you can break into our home and intimidate us? That ain't the way it works here, boys. Whatever he and Paul Vitti talked about is privileged. He doesn't have to tell you a thing.
53) 22) dialog: Tarasoff vs. The University of California. Look it up. Now, if he's done something wrong, take him downtown and book him. Otherwise, I'll ask you very kindly to get the hell out of my house.
53) 26) dialog: (furious) Oh, shut up!
53) 27) text: Laura storms out of the room in a fury. Ben stands, looking miserable, then we hear Michael's voice from the vent.
59) 0) text: Steadman shuts off a tape recorder, having just played the altered tape for a stunned Ben and Laura. A long beat, then Ben looks up at the agents.
