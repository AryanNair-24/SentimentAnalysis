Anyway, you'll see, there's not much going on. It's pretty calm around here. Ben follows Lorenzo through the burnt display counters. H listens but his mind has drifted elsewhere.

1) 20) dialog: Thank God you didn't show up any later. This place gives me the chills at night. ... No electricity, and all these mirrors... You know, I live in                     Brooklyn near a Jewish neighborhood,                     and when someone dies, they cover all                    the mirrors in their house. Some say that it's just to renounce all vanity during the mourning period, but others say something else... They say it's to keep the soul of the dead from being trapped in the mirrors... Believe it                     or not, there's always a bit of truth in any superstition. Am I right?

How long has it been since                      you left the NYPD?
