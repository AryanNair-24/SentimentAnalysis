Listen, I think I've                   got something else for you. I know a                    guy at the Mayflower corporation and                    they need someone to watch over one of                  their department stores.

I                    know you're over qualified for that                     position but it's a good opportunity                    for you for the time being...until the                  situation here quiets down. Also the                    money is not that bad.                                  Ben is having a hard time to contain his anger.

If you want to                  see your kids, you've got to get a                      job, any job.                                           Deep inside, Ben knows Larry's right.

10) 66) dialog: The water has obliterated most of the marks. No trace of struggle or broken entry, the entrance door was locked.
10) 71) dialog: The person who did this must have had                    the keys to her apartment, or                            otherwise it was somebody she knew...                   
10) 73) dialog: Listen, so far, his statement is                         pretty consistent with the facts... We checked it out, he did place a call from work at 12:30, and the woman's                      downstairs neighbors claim they started noticing the water leakage at around two in the morning. The daytime security guard, Lorenzo Sappeli, confirms he came on after Ben's shift at seven a.m. The only strange thing, and it may just be a coincidence, is that Ben told Sappeli that he had decided to quit his job, as if he was planning to go away somewhere... Did he mention anything about it to you?
10) 75) dialog: I figure we'll let him go. At this                       point we haven't got any real reason                     to keep him here. And, I think he's                      had his share for the day.                              
10) 77) dialog: Listen, where we stand now, we got                       nothing, not a single clue. I'm sure                     he can help us.                                         
10) 82) dialog: He's still the best one I know, even if he's one of the suspects. Amy comes closer to the two-way mirror. She looks at her husband on the other side. He seems overcome with grief a confusion. She can see the distress in his eyes.
