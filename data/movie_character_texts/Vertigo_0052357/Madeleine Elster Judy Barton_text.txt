They are talking amiably; Scottie is being genial and companionable, but there ts no particular sense of intimacy. Judy looks about quite a bit, obviously admiring the room, and the food and the clothes of the people about her. She is dressed neatly, but more simply and more cheaply than are the other women in the room, and she is conscious of it, and keeps fiddling with the shoulders of her dress. oo i During this, a party of diners enters, is greeted ‘by the captain, and is led across the room toward an empty table near Judy and Scottie. We go with them winding among the tables. As we get very close to Scottie, he looks up and becomes rigid, and stares. A waman has just gone by him to take a@ seat’at the neighboring table. Her hair is blonde, and is done exactly as was Madeleine's; from the rear she could easily be Madeleine. But then she turns and sits down, glancing at Scottie as she does, and we see that it is not Madeleine. A moment, then Scottie looks away. Judy is staring at him anxiously. It is her first defeat, and her first victory: defeat, in'that although he is with her he is'still searching; victory, in that she is sure, now, that he doses not think she is Madeleine.

Her eyebrows have been plucked, her makeup lightened, her lip- stick changed and she now bears much more of a re= semblance to Madeleine.
