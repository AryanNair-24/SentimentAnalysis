41) 13) dialog: (Nonchalantly) I'm just watching the destruction of Mirando property. Kim laughs. Behind the truck, the Black Assailants drag Okja towards their trailer. Okja desperately looks around for Mija. But she can't see anywhere. Traffic is at a standstill. DRIVERS in the opposite lane stopped their cars to take pictures and record video of t bizarre sight. Suddenly, among the pileup of cars, a girl ARISES. It is Mija. She limps to a car and climbs onto its roof. Her bo is covered in grazes but she is undeterred. She takes a deep breath and blows hard on her WHISTLE. Ok suddenly turns her head as she is being dragged away. Okja and Mija finally see each other. 41. Despite her injuries, Mija dashes toward Okja. But Okja cannot move. The Black Assailants have her locked down wi ropes. Okja tips her body and rolls over the Black Assailants. T scream - crushed by the weight. Okja and Mija beeline toward each other. They REUNITE, OVERJOYED. Like a gunslinger jumping onto a running horse a Western, Mija grabs the rope tied to Okja's body and swiftly jumps onto her back.
