14) 40) dialog: I'm sorry I was kinda grumpy when I first arrived on your farm. Being a television presenter can be stressful. Mija looks blank - she has no idea what he's saying. As Chang gets cutaways of Okja, Mundo tries to squeeze in the frame.
14) 42) dialog: (still talking to Mija) I always have to be 'on'. Especially now I find myself the ‘face of the Mirando Corporation'! How did that even happen?! Hee Bong grabs Mija's hand and takes her to the corner of yard.

62) 0) text: Heavy silence. The faces of the A.L.F. members are lit by ghostly light of the computer screen. 73. They are seeing Okja's POV, but because one side of the ‘White Room' is covered entirely by a mirror, they see everything Okja is going through.
