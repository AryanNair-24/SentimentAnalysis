JAY'S POV: Behind the crowd, we see a black semi-trailer truck rushing toward the plaza. At Jay's signal, the A.L. crew begin moving in organized fashion. They fight off po and crowd members and create a path for the semi to appro Mija and Okja.
84) 0) text: Nancy's terse, chilling orders continue in VOICE-OVER as see Okja, Mija, Jay and the A.L.F. members running throug the alley. We only hear Nancy and Frank's voices. 99.
85) 0) text: Jay lays the barely conscious Mija in the passenger seat. He's exhausted and covered in blood. The driver takes off balaclava. It's K!
85) 14) dialog: Yes. K turns his head slightly. He translates in a rigid, form tone, sitting upright and tightly gripping the steering wheel.

85) 24) dialog: (Annoyed by Jay's oblique comments ) My help with WHAT? K abruptly stops the truck. Jay and Mija and K climb/tumb out into... ...a vast feedyard.
86) 1) dialog: Okja! Mija, Jay and K split up and run in DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS through the field shouting Okja's name - small dots in th vast field filled with countless Super Pigs, all with the same face. Soon they are far away from each other.
86) 6) dialog: (mumbling to herself) Okja... The pig at the top of the line turns toward Mija, crying desperately.
86) 7) dialog: It's Okja! Mija quickly looks for Jay and K, but they're too far awa There's no time. She has to do this alone. Mija runs as fast as she can toward the slaughterhouse. O sees her and cries harder, but she is shoved further down line into the slaughterhouse. K sees Okja and calls after Jay, who turns and begins run toward Okja with K. A WORKER at the entrance gives Okja's bottom a jolt with taser. Quick and efficient, an everyday routine. Okja sta walking again. She enters the slaughterhouse.
86) 8) dialog: No!! Don't go inside!! Mija's voice is overwhelmed by the machinery noise coming from the slaughterhouse. She sees an employee's entrance metres from the door Okja walked into. She hurries toward it. 105.
87) 0) text: Mija enters the 'factory of death'. The structure is labyrinthine, and she has no idea where to go. She's cons by shock and fear. The humidity, the revolting smell, the deafening noise, the slick, blood-covered floor. A trauma sight for a girl who grew up in the mountains. Various slabs of meat hanging from metal hooks move stead along the aerial conveyor system. Instinctively, she runs the opposite direction of the movement. WORKERS wearing large noise-blocking earmuffs stand along conveyor system and go about their jobs. They look at Mij with some curiosity, but return to their work. They're un to leave the ever-moving production line. Mija finally arrives at the stun box - aka the execution She sees a Super Pig being forced into the box. Its head firmly fitted into a hole in the front. A YOUNG HISPANIC WORKER aims a large bolt gun at its forehead and prepares shoot when he sees Mija running toward him. He briefly hesitates but soon returns his attention to his task. CLOSE on Mija’s face. We hear a BANG. The worker has evidently pulled the trigger. Mija is too horrified to ev scream. Mija freezes after witnessing the execution in all its gruesome reality. The next Super Pig is led into the stun box. It's Okja.
87) 1) dialog: (a trembling voice) Okja... Mija goes blank, completely petrified. She looks straight Okja, whose head is being threaded through the 'hole of death.'
87) 2) dialog: It's okay... Okja seems to know that death is imminent. She desperatel tries to free her head. She looks up at Mija with tear-fi eyes.
87) 3) dialog: Because... Mija's voice trembles. The Hispanic Worker looks at Mija he reloads the bolt gun. He doesn't know who the hell thi girl is or why she's here. He just carries on with his wo 106.
87) 4) dialog: Even this man... With his eyes still on Mija, the Hispanic Worker aims the bolt gun at Okja's forehead. Okja closes her eyes when sh feels the cold barrel of the bolt gun on her forehead. Te fall. Mija looks into the Worker's eyes.
87) 5) dialog: -.-he doesn't want to do this. Mija raises her hand at the worker. 'Hold on.' She reache into her back pocket with her other hand. For some reason the Hispanic Worker is compelled to hold back from pullin the trigger. He looks into Mija's eyes. Mija removes a PHOTOGRAPH from her back pocket. She shows to the Worker. It's one of the photos from Mija's room. 1 year-old Mija tightly hugging Okja. The Hispanic Worker squints at the photo, his bolt gun still trained on Okja' forehead. The production line becomes backed up, and the ALARM begi to sound. Red lights flash throughout the slaughterhouse. CLOSE ON the Hispanic Worker's ambiguous expression. He points at the photo Mija is holding - ‘that pig...' - then points at Okja - '...is this pig?' Mija nods quietly. The Hispanic Worker freezes. The finge around the trigger trembles lightly. Just then Jay and K arrive, out of breath. They stop next Mija. Okja stays absolutely still with her mouth fiercely clamped and eyes closed. Suddenly... A loud metallic CREAK. The large stun box leans to the side. We see the Hispanic Worker holding down the button. Okja, still alive, slides onto the conveyor belt below. Mija's legs give in and she falls on her knees. She embra Okja's head. Her arms continue to shake. The Hispanic Worker looks down at them with a heavy heart But he soon breaks out of his lull and returns to work li nothing happened. He brings in the next pig. The ALARM an the red lights stop - the production line being back to normal. 107. Mija sobs as she watches the continued death march. K hur over and helps Mija onto her feet. Jay leads the group to the exit. As they round the corner...
87) 13) dialog: I wanna go home, with Okja. Mija says each word slowly and clearly. 108.
87) 15) dialog: Why you want to kill Okja?
87) 29) dialog: Wait! Mija's voice booms throughout the slaughterhouse. She zip open her ridiculous fanny pack and reaches inside. She ta out the shiny gold pig that Hee Bong gave her. Mija holds up the gold pig.
87) 30) dialog: I wanna buy Okja! Alive! Nancy looks at the gold pig, amused. The little girl is impressive. Mija pushes the gold pig toward Nancy. It gli across the slick, blood-covered floor and stops at Nancy' foot. Frank takes out his handkerchief and wipes the bloo off as he picks it up. Nancy picks up the gold pig and studies it carefully. She gives it a quick bite with her front teeth. A strange, grotesque expression appears on her face. She winces at t lingering smell of blood before quietly gazing at Mija.
88) 0) text: Two Black Chalk Mercenaries lead Mija and Okja across the expansive feed-yard. Mija looks back and sees the line of pigs marching into the slaughterhouse. The death march lo even sadder under the beautiful light of the moon. Mija's heart is heavy as she leaves the rest of the pigs behind. The pigs inside the fence watch Okja enviously as she lea Two Super Pigs walk along the fence and begin following O Mija and Okja look at them curiously, soon noticing somet between the two adult pigs - a small PIGLET, their baby. The mother pig pushes the baby through the fence with her snout. The piglet is small enough to fit through the wire but it kicks and squirms and refuses to separate from its parents. The mother stubbornly shoves it through the fenc Mija realizes what the mother is trying to do. She quickl herds the piglet under Okja’s belly and looks at the two Black Chalk Mercenaries walking ahead. They are too immer in their conversation to notice. The baby pig keeps looking back as it treads along under cover of Okja’s belly. Its mother and father poke their h over the fence and let out a heartfelt SQUEAL - a goodbye As they do, other super pigs notice the BABY ESCAPEE and begin SQUEALING as well. Their cries spread, until ALL th super pigs in the feedyard have joined in - a CACOPHONY o SORROW, but also of DEFIANCE and CELEBRATION. The Black Chalks look around dumbfounded. As they do the cries reach a crescendo, and one of the pigs begins POOPI 111. And then THOUSANDS do. Thousands of super pigs shoot poop of their behinds like fireworks - a bizarre and miraculou act of rebellion. A celebration of life. Mija continues walking, a brave smile, her eyes moist. Okja carefully traipses along, minding the piglet underne like her own.

She looks down at he belly where the piglet has fallen asleep with her face do Mija gently runs her hand over the piglet's body. Mija, i turn, is lying on top of the sleeping Okja. A tower of bodies: Okja - Mija - the piglet. A gentle breeze blows from the woods. The piglet shifts i her sleep and falls off Mija onto the grass. She looks around, dazed, before finding a place underneath Okja's e and returning to sleep. The woods, the sun, the breeze. Peace is all around. With her eyes closed, Okja flaps her ears and creates a gentle breeze for the piglet. Lying on Okja's back, Mija looks up at the trees and the blue sky.
