She’s speaking to h passengers for the day: EIGHT INTERNATIONAL VIPs -(whose personal fortunes come from American oil money, Mexican telecom, Brazilian Manufacturing, and Indian petrochemica MORRIS (CONT’D) Imagine exploring an alien world, whose scale dwarfs the highest of mountains, the grandest of canyons. Now imagine, instead of this being a fantasy, instead of it being a journey that would take years to complete, you could do it right here, right now. Ladies and Gentlemen, I welcome you, our first outside guests, to Mana-One.
7) 0) text: Morris leads the VIPs across the deck, heading for the on visible structure, a BANK OF ELEVATORS, that sticks up on otherwise flat platform, like some kind of design mistake
8) 0) text: ...Then the ELEVATOR takes that to another level. It’s a massive freight lift - the kind you’d find in a garment warehouse. The only clue that there is something more goi on here is that Morris is holding out STICKS OF--
8) 1) dialog: Chewing gum, anyone? For your ears. I recommend it. The first time down can be a bit much. And so this group of people, collectively worth 1/4 of a TRILLION DOLLARS, take sticks of 99-cent chewing gum.
8) 3) dialog: Your ears are popping because, even though the station is normalized, pressure changes underwater are much greater than they are in the air. A Scuba diver, rising from the depth we're going to, would have to spend hours in a decompression tank or die a painful death. Then again, no scuba diver has ever been as deep as you're about to be. They reach the O-level. The elevator stops with a LURCH.
8) 4) dialog: Your gum? Morris holds out a CHEAP PLASTIC CONTAINER for those who to get rid of their gum. That’s the last straw for TEXAS.
10) 6) dialog: Ten months. In addition to this level, we're building a restaurant we think has the world’s greatest view, a hospital-quality infirmary, and most importantly, a gift shop. That gets laughs.
10) 8) dialog: (Prompting Zhang) So, it’s no accident we invited you all here today...
10) 10) text: mission is to change that. Right now, as I speak to you, a team of our submersibles, including one piloted by my daughter, is putting the last of our UNIS BOT sensor stations in place, 30,000 feet below us. When powered up, these BOTS will send back images, the likes of which no one has seen before. And we want you, our angel investors, to be with us when we turn them on for the first time. Now everyone is really jazzed. TEXAS VIP looks at Morris.
11) 0) text: Zhang, Morris, Meiying and the VIPs emerge from the eleva and find themselves in a Mission-Control like space, know the DIVE CONTROL CENTER (DCC). A small TEAM OF PERSONNEL (who we'll get to know) is monitoring every aspect of the current mission into the trench. A dazzling array of vide screens shows us everything from the CREW MEMBERS’ VITAL SIGNS, to IMAGES FROM INSIDE THE SUBS, and of course, IMA OF WHAT’S OUTSIDE THE SUBS. A TACTICAL DISPLAY shows a computer representation of the dive going on right now. Two sleek ABYSS GLIDERS (Fastbac and Fastback 2) are orbiting at 20,000 feet down, acting sonar eyes in the sky for the two MULE SUBS (Angel 1 and Angel 2) that are actually in the trench placing the last the UNIS BOTS into position. The DIVE OPERATIONS CHIEF, James “MAC” Mackriedes, 30s, r around the edges, nods ‘hello’ to the VIPs and then resum what he’s doing. JAMES “MAC” MACKRIEDES (into a mic) Angel one, have you got that last bot in position? ANGEL ONE, the first of the Mules, is captained by JUNJIE Chen and co-piloted by CARL Sheppherd. We see their cockp on a screen. There’s a delay between the video and audio:
17) 5) dialog: (to the VIPs) --So we just want to say thank you, again, for making the trip to be a part of history. Before we take you back to Shanghai, we do still have one very important thing we have to do -- raid that gift shop so no one goes home empty handed. The VIPs step in the ELEVATOR, the door CLOSES, they’re G
54) 1) dialog: Captain Taylor, I’m Presca Morris, one of the financial partners in Mana-One. I was looking up your records, and, well, all I found were records. Most dives below 20,0000 feet, most rescues in the history of the Navy, the list went on and on... Needless to say, I’m very glad you're with us.
61) 0) text: FAN has the dive up on TACTICAL DISPLAY. HELLER has all their vitals on screen. DIMITRI and ZHANG are at the planning table, and MAC (with Morris behind him) is at th center of it all.
63) 2) dialog: What’s the thermocline?
80) 0) text: Morris and Zhang greatly relieved. Dimitri satisfied with his work. Fan squeezes his hand.
142) 0) text: Peace and quiet in one of Hainan’s most tranquil bays. The MAZU is anchored a few hundred yards off shore from T NEW 5-STAR “MANA RESORT AND SPA”. The place is a few mont from opening, but Morris’s crown jewel is fully built, wi skeleton staff is putting it through its paces. 53.
144) 0) text: A room with a view of the Pacific. Right now it hosts an INTENSE DISCUSSION between Zhang, Morris, Heller, and Mac
144) 1) dialog: .-.I’m not saying what happened wasn’t a tragedy, I just want to set that aside long enough to talk about what we found down there and what it means for the future. Because the choices we make between now and when you announce what happened could mean billions of dollars of added value. REVEAL - JONAS, outside, listening and thinking that-- EXT/INT. THE RESORT’S OPEN-AIR RESTAURANT - DAY Jonas finds Suyin and Meiying have set up tea at a table along the water’s edge.
144) 7) dialog: But where we dove today, at the very bottom, that water was warm. Zhang indicates ‘Siren’s Void’ - the vast basin of the Marianas Trench - an area more than 1,000 miles long. The CHART bottom...
144) 12) dialog: (thrilled) Meaning we’re sitting on top of our very own Jurassic sea! INTERCUT -- THE RESORT’S OPEN-AIR RESTAURANT - SUNSET Meiying is showing Jonas the proper way to hold his tea c and Jonas is purposely getting it wrong to make her laugh
144) 25) dialog: Why am I the only one excited here? I’m no Marine Biologist, but even I remember the prehistoric oceans were filled will all sorts of amazing creatures.
144) 27) dialog: Again, I’m not discounting that...
144) 30) dialog: You can’t be serious...
144) 32) dialog: Which means we should double its size. Then build a second one--
144) 34) dialog: If those things have been down there for 200 million years, I think their ecosystem can handle it-
144) 43) dialog: Dr. Zhang, you are a brilliant man. But if you think you can control what’s about to happen, you are, forgive me, very naive. Before today, your platform was a specialty attraction. But when the world hears what you found, it is going to be the most desired destination on Earth. Every child (MORE )
144) 45) dialog: on the planet will want to come here. Every parent will make it a priority. This resort, and every resort within 500 miles will devote themselves to what’s down there. Whether we like that or not-- Morris stops as suddenly the door is thrown open. SUYIN, breathless from running, is there.
149) 0) text: Jonas looking at Zhang and Morris. He’s backed by DJ and Francois. Suyin somewhere in the middle.
153) 4) dialog: .--Actually madness, if I understand Dr. Zhang correctly, would be to let this creature roam off towards the fishing fleet. Those boats wouldn’t stand a chance.
159) 5) dialog: (to Zhang) Do you want them to wait?
165) 1) dialog: They're getting frustrated.
193) 0) text: The Mazu’s remaining CRANE ARM is HOISTING the DEAD MEG o of the water by its tail as DJ, FAN, and MORRIS look on.
193) 1) dialog: It’s spectacular...
195) 1) dialog: Will one of you take my picture? She holds out her camera phone. Is she for real? Finally, Fan relents.
195) 2) dialog: Either of you want to join me?
195) 4) dialog: It’s been an emotional day. But I want you both to remember, what you've done here is unprecedented. You're part of something truly historic. Morris walks back inside the ship. Once she’s gone--
197) 0) text: Suyin’s operation attracts the attention of MORRIS, who c running back in--
197) 1) dialog: Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? We're going to want that thing to look perfect! SLIDE - That’s the sound that a MEG’S TOOTH, now liberate from the jaw, makes as it SKIDS across the deck and stops FAN'S FEET. As Fan bends down to pick it up... ...-Suyin pushes off the side of the shark, SWINGS out ov the ocean, and then back towards the deck. She RELEASES t harness and lands in a trot towards her friends as MORRIS annoyed, rushes over to the Meg to inspect the damage.
197) 2) dialog: What were you thinking?! FAN now has the tooth in her hands. She uses the ruler on her iPhone to measure the size. Then her face goes pale. She looks at SUYIN. Suyin nods.
197) 8) dialog: (excited) Wait are you saying there’s a bigger Meg? THE ANSWER -- COMES IN HORRIFYING SCALE AND VIOLENCE. As suddenly the OCEAN BEHIND THE MAZU EXPLODES. THE ‘MOMMA’ MEGALADON comes flying out of the water at a sideways angle. She’s so massive that her arrival BLOCKS THE SUN, ECLIPSING THE MAZU, as her MIGHTY JAWS SNATCH th smaller Meg that was once her child but is now her meal. MORRIS’S POV -- All she sees is Shark. It would be her dr come true except for the fact that-- THOOMP! The MEG takes Morris with it as it DISAPPEARS int the sea!
197) 9) text: But not before... SMASH...! Its MASSIVE TAIL crashes thro the AFT DECK of the Mazu with SUCH FORCE that the ship PITCHES NOSE UP INTO THE AIR before SLAMMING BACK DOWN. DJ’S POV - FOR A MOMENT - THINGS ARE DISORIENTING. There’ NO SOUND, vision is BLURRY... Then, when the SOUND comes it’s FILLED WITH DEAFENING SIRENS. And when VISION is restored, we see part of the aft deck is gone completely. Fan and Suyin, both having nearly fallen into the sea, re their feet. Fan looks around for Morris.
