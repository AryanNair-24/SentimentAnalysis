She’s speaking to h passengers for the day: EIGHT INTERNATIONAL VIPs -(whose personal fortunes come from American oil money, Mexican telecom, Brazilian Manufacturing, and Indian petrochemica MORRIS (CONT’D) Imagine exploring an alien world, whose scale dwarfs the highest of mountains, the grandest of canyons. Now imagine, instead of this being a fantasy, instead of it being a journey that would take years to complete, you could do it right here, right now. Ladies and Gentlemen, I welcome you, our first outside guests, to Mana-One.
11) 0) text: Zhang, Morris, Meiying and the VIPs emerge from the eleva and find themselves in a Mission-Control like space, know the DIVE CONTROL CENTER (DCC). A small TEAM OF PERSONNEL (who we'll get to know) is monitoring every aspect of the current mission into the trench. A dazzling array of vide screens shows us everything from the CREW MEMBERS’ VITAL SIGNS, to IMAGES FROM INSIDE THE SUBS, and of course, IMA OF WHAT’S OUTSIDE THE SUBS. A TACTICAL DISPLAY shows a computer representation of the dive going on right now. Two sleek ABYSS GLIDERS (Fastbac and Fastback 2) are orbiting at 20,000 feet down, acting sonar eyes in the sky for the two MULE SUBS (Angel 1 and Angel 2) that are actually in the trench placing the last the UNIS BOTS into position. The DIVE OPERATIONS CHIEF, James “MAC” Mackriedes, 30s, r around the edges, nods ‘hello’ to the VIPs and then resum what he’s doing. JAMES “MAC” MACKRIEDES (into a mic) Angel one, have you got that last bot in position? ANGEL ONE, the first of the Mules, is captained by JUNJIE Chen and co-piloted by CARL Sheppherd. We see their cockp on a screen. There’s a delay between the video and audio:
11) 4) dialog: Fan, let’s go ahead and ping the BOTS so we can start them up. This to Linfan “FAN” Chang, 24, a marine biologist whose are covered in decorative tattoos of mermaids and sea creatures. Fan is Meiying’s favorite team member, (beside her mom and grandpa), so it’s no surprise that Meiying ha joined her at the control panel. Fan enters a series of commands on her keyboard.
11) 13) dialog: (nervous, into the mic) Angel One, do you have a visual? (static) Junjie, I say again, do you have a visual? (static) Suyin, can you see anything from up where you are? Silence. It’s horrible. Mac is about to speak again when-
16) 0) text: Rock slide? The smile from Mac’s face vanishes.
17) 4) dialog: Everything is fine. The test went perfectly. I’ve asked Dimitri to power down the Bots so we could re- position them. Our placement was good, but you know Dr. Zhang, it has to be perfect, so... Morris, reading Mac, has already called for the Elevator. She jumps in--
17) 6) dialog: Thank God the dog and pony show is over because I haven’t cursed in (MORE )
17) 8) dialog: twenty minutes and I’m starting to worry about what might come out of my mouth. Talk to me, people. Mac approaches Dimitri, who is hovering over Fan, both watching the computer systems reboot. As Mac arrives he “loosens” his tie. Except Mac’s wearing a clip-on tie - so it comes right off. Fan’s attention turns from the comput screen to Mac’s absurd accessory.
17) 10) dialog: You think my tie is the reason we're staring at a wall of blank monitors!?

46) 13) dialog: --That was your explanation, doctor. Not his.
46) 15) dialog: Because it gave them a scapegoat. It let them close the books on bad mission and move on. (to Zhang) Dr. Zhang, a rescue like this, even with the best equipment in the world, is risky. If it’s me down there, if it’s my daughter going down there, there’s only one man on the planet I want for the job.

57) 3) dialog: Zhang's daughter is tough, but remember she just lost two friends--

Mac's voice trails off because he and Jonas are now distracted by THE SIGHT OF DJ, kneeling in front of Fastb 2, holding a small bundle of BURNING SAGE towards the hat
