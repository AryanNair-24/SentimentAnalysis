A dazzling array of vide screens shows us everything from the CREW MEMBERS’ VITAL SIGNS, to IMAGES FROM INSIDE THE SUBS, and of course, IMA OF WHAT’S OUTSIDE THE SUBS. A TACTICAL DISPLAY shows a computer representation of the dive going on right now. Two sleek ABYSS GLIDERS (Fastbac and Fastback 2) are orbiting at 20,000 feet down, acting sonar eyes in the sky for the two MULE SUBS (Angel 1 and Angel 2) that are actually in the trench placing the last the UNIS BOTS into position.
