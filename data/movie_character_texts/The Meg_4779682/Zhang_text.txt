10) 7) dialog: For years, I’ve traveled the world, urging people to take better care of the sea. My hope is now, by bringing the world here, the sea will speak for itself. There is some spontaneous applause for the achievement.
10) 9) dialog: ...Yes. As you may remember, Mana- One is built where it is to give us access to the deepest reaches of our planet. The Marianas Trench. Nearly seven miles below the surface at its base, the mysteries of the trench hold the keys to a better understanding of the world in which we live. And yet it remains a place mankind has seen less of than the planet Mars. Our (MORE )

A small TEAM OF PERSONNEL (who we'll get to know) is monitoring every aspect of the current mission into the trench. A dazzling array of vide screens shows us everything from the CREW MEMBERS’ VITAL SIGNS, to IMAGES FROM INSIDE THE SUBS, and of course, IMA OF WHAT’S OUTSIDE THE SUBS. A TACTICAL DISPLAY shows a computer representation of the dive going on right now. Two sleek ABYSS GLIDERS (Fastbac and Fastback 2) are orbiting at 20,000 feet down, acting sonar eyes in the sky for the two MULE SUBS (Angel 1 and Angel 2) that are actually in the trench placing the last the UNIS BOTS into position. The DIVE OPERATIONS CHIEF, James “MAC” Mackriedes, 30s, r around the edges, nods ‘hello’ to the VIPs and then resum what he’s doing. JAMES “MAC” MACKRIEDES (into a mic) Angel one, have you got that last bot in position? ANGEL ONE, the first of the Mules, is captained by JUNJIE Chen and co-piloted by CARL Sheppherd.

And then another... PING...

50) 13) dialog: I wouldn't have given credence to your theories. But now... Now, two of my friends are dead. And my daughter is only alive by providence.

We don’t see wha he’s looking at, but we know he’s made up his mind.

144) 9) dialog: The coldest water is always here in the thermocline. This water is too cold to support any life.
144) 11) dialog: Given that we’ve never explored Siren’s Void, and given we've encountered at least one species, the Megaladon, heretofore thought extinct, I think the odds are there is an entire ecosystem down there that has remained untouched for millions of years.
144) 29) dialog: Speculation is dangerous, Ms. Morris. Only one thing is clear: we've found something very special, so we must proceed with caution. I'm afraid our plans to commercialize the Mana-One must be put on indefinite hold.

144) 33) dialog: This isn’t about attracting visitors. It’s about making sure we protect the ecosystem.

If there is a Megaladon here, if we leave it free to feed and mate, then we would be responsible for the worst ecological disaster in history. We, who have given our lives to protect these oceans. (he looks at Dimitri) Are you sure your cage will hold?
159) 6) dialog: (shakes his head no) We’ll put her on the next one. Morris NODS to the pilot. The HELICOPTER lifts off.
