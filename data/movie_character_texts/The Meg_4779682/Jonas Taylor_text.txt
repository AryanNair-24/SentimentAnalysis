55) 6) dialog: Well, I see my reputation precedes me. Who said that? 28.
55) 9) dialog: Yeah, I bet you are... Mac EXITS, leaving Jonas and Meiying alone. Jonas gets a kick out of the little girl’s moxie.

55) 12) dialog: (laughs ) You’re tough.
55) 14) dialog: Titanium? Wow, I’ve never met a girl made of titanium. I’ve dated a few made of ice but... Jonas goes to squeeze Meiying’s biceps, which she’s offer as proof of her strength.

56) 14) dialog: ..-But, no, they were convinced it had to be a landslide. The word hangs there. Suddenly, all is quiet.
56) 15) dialog: I don’t blame them. I thought that at first too. I mean, what else could show up on the sonar like that? What else could tear open metal like it was tin? You don’t think about the fact that this ‘landslide’ isn’t triggering any readings on the seismograph. You don’t say to yourself - this is the most accurate, lethal, guided landslide in the 4 billion year history of geology. Because what else could it be, right? After a long silence.

It drops through the inky depths. Illuminating a wall fil with brightly colored algae, coral, alien creatures, unti WHOOSH, the massive beast snatches the flare, its enormou jaws illuminated for the first time. The creature swims through its target, colliding violently with the undersea mountain range like a fiery wrecking ball. The sea wall t once provided shelter for Francois, now reduced to rubble
130) 3) dialog: Mana, this is Angel Three. We’ve blown our ballast and are rising, power off. We’ve lost our directional control so someone’s going to have to come meet us. 50.
131) 2) dialog: I guess she learned that trick. Jonas begins to power the sub back on.
