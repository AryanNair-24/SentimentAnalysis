The Werewolf rises to full height so we finally lay eyes upon him: truly half-man/half-wolf, bipedal, covered in dense, dark FUR with much GREY FUR on his face. He wears Sir John's PANTS and tattered SHIRT. His CLAWED hands, jowls and heaving chest are matted with fresh BLOOD. Sir John's features are recognizable in the Werewolf's frightful visage, especially in the EYES; but there is no humanity there. The Werewolf is an animal. The Werewolf lets out a ear-splitting ROAR, fangs bared! Lawrence looks to his right... Where his PISTOL lies not far away. Lawrence dives towards the gun, reaching...

73) 20) dialog: I barely fought the thing off, but not before I was bitten. So when I returned to Blackmoor and my family, to recover from my wounds... I had no idea a demon slumbered inside me. In my very blood.
73) 23) dialog: At the time, I was fully prepared to take my own life. How could I not, after what I had done? Except... it was not me.

73) 45) dialog: If I came forward, they never would have let it end! She gave them a name, as I told her to. The next night would have passed without incident. I would have made certain of that. She should have been released to leave with her tribe! I was willing to lose her, if that's what it took. Against every emotion in my heart, I would've watched her walk out of my life, even carrying my own child! So long she was free! (fury growing) You saw. You saw how the good villagers of Blackmoor held their tongues while Strickland paraded Carmilla before them! After so many years of my protecting every man, woman and child from the abomination inside me! To what end? So I should have to watch as their persecutions drove her to her death...!?
73) 53) dialog: To hell with each and every one of them. Let them mount whatever defense they can manage... till either Blackmoor is dead... or I am.
73) 55) dialog: You may be right. Absolutely. But, what concern is it of yours anymore? You've been bitten. You must know what that means. Lawrence does know, desolate, straining in his bindings.
73) 56) dialog: It would have been God's mercy if you weren't discovered alive, but you were. You survived. (long pause) There's only one gesture of kindness I can show you now. Sir John produces a STRAIGHT RAZOR, shows its blade.
73) 57) dialog: Keep it hidden. Till a time comes when you are alone and can use it. Sir John comes to place the closed RAZOR in Lawrence's bo hand, so Lawrence can palm it.
73) 58) dialog: Farewell, son. Farewell. Sir John walks towards the door. Lawrence is demoralized, but takes a deep breath, mustering one last defiance.

100) 22) dialog: You know full well how you wronged him... how it was as if a part of himself was torn away when he found you gone. He loved you! (pause) For those wounds you inflicted upon him... I admit could never have forgiven you.
