At that instant, Rocklin slams the door shut. The intruder whirls around. It is Arly -- tense -- and now defiant. The two regard each other like vicious animals in the sam cage. Arly's heart is pounding, but you would never know And now Rocklin, his gun away, starts closing in, slowly but Arly holds her ground -- her eyes never leaving his. When Rocklin reaches Arly, he takes her one hand from beh her back, and slowly forcing it up sees what is obviously Clara's letter in her tightly clenched fist. He tries to  open her hand, and Arly, knowing she lacks the strength t prevent it, suddenly whips out a knife with her free hand But that quick, Rocklin grabs the knife hand, and without any apparent effort, wrenches it free of her grasp and to it across the room, where it lands on the bunk. Arly rela her grip on the letter meanwhile, and Rocklin gets it, an tears it very deliberately, letting the pieces fall at he feet. He turns his back on her now, going over to his hat on th floor.

It passes too close to Arly for comfort an Rocklin just opening the door, gets the knife right back that close to his ear he feels the breeze. He looks at it quivering in the door. Then, moving to Arly in what could construed as a threatening manner, he takes her in his ar and kisses her. Arly is caught completely unaware. Rockli action disarms her. But it is, after all, what she really wants, so before the kiss ends, Arly's arms slowly entwin themselves around Rocklin's neck.
