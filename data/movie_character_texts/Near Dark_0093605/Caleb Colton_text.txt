Caleb stares at the girl. She runs a hand through thick, shiny brown hair, brushing back off her forehead. Exposing her face. Heart shaped. Impossibly pale skin in the fluorescent glow. Wide eyes, a depthless ice blue like a sunny, summer sky. A small mouth out of which a narrow red tongue swipes at melting cone in her hands. She looks to be in her late teens. A faded cowboy shirt fits snugly across her chest. A pair of Levis meet a dusty pair of black cowboy boots. Those blue eyes lift and light on Caleb's face.

17) 1) dialog: Now I don't want you opening your eyes. He puts his other hand over her eyes. A big smile on his face as he edges her forward. Suddenly the horse backs so abruptly it almost trips. Eyes wild with fear. The two people just stand there. The farmboy pulls his hand away from the girl's eyes. He walks up to the pen.

The horse shakes its head back and forth, scared out of i skin. 14 Bewildered, the farmboy lifts the rope over its head. The horse pivots on its back feet, tearing off. Caleb heads back toward Mae. Climbing back over the fence and standing beside her. Her watching him with uncannily even eyes. Smiling elusively to herself, she turns her back to him. Moving off with an easy gait past the other pens. Inside the fences, there is a SCURRYING of animals. A sudden RUSTLING in the nearby tundra of the prairie. Caleb scans the landscape, sets his eyes on Mae, then sha head and shrugs. Mae is sauntering away, her back to him, running her fing along the fence posts. The farmboy swings the lasso lariet style over his head. Letting the loop fall over the girl's shoulders. She looks over her shoulder at him. Her eyes cool. He smiles. Starts reeling her in. She backs. A smile slipping across her face.

Gathering up the rope in his hands. Their eyes wedded. She is just in front of him now. He gives one last tug on the line. Drawing her in. His face drifting toward hers. Letting his lips brush over hers and stops. Her eyes close. His hands fold around her back. A cloud passes over the moon. 15 A shadow crosses their faces. Her soft, moist lips slide over his mouth. Nuzzling down the side of his neck. He lifts closed eyes to the sky. Her breath warm on his skin. His skin trembling with the touch. Her lips start to draw back. She jerks her head back, struggling with her instinct. Lifting her arms, yanking the rope off her shoulders.

Her teeth fasten onto his neck. Caleb cries out. Tries to push her off. She holds him firm by the shoulders in an iron grip. Tears explode out of her eyes. She rips her blood moistened lips from his neck. Shearing herself away from him. Plunging out the door of the truck. Headfirst. Caleb remains in the seat. Rubbing his throat. Fingering the pinprick of a wound. Surprised and astonished, he jumps out of the parked vehi Chasing after the panic-stricken girl scrambling away.

The SOUND of an AUTOMOTIVE ENGINE behind him. He looks desperately over his shoulder. A balloon of dirt. A pale, ghostly cream colored Winnegabo is bearing down o Almost upon him. He knows it is useless to resist. He surrenders, his eyes rolling up into their sockets. His legs giving out from under him. Knees buckling. The recreational vehicle lumbers by.
