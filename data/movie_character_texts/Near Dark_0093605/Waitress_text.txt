The Pickup cuts a curve into the parking space in a showe gravel. Caleb jumps out. Has a casual look around him. Like he wouldn't piss if his pants were on fire. He lights up a Marlboro. Deep heels it up to the window. Leans back on his elbows on the counter. The orange haired WAITRESS behind the window looks irrita at the farmboy.

A fat, low to the ground TRUCKER at the bar turns a flatt face over thick shoulders to regard the fresh arrivals wi dull look. A COWBOY TEENAGER lifts his pool cue. The WAITRESS picks some empty glasses off the table in th booth. The BARTENDER CLICKS his teeth. A quiet comes over the joint. Severen winks and elbows Caleb in the ribs. Speaking in a voice loud enough for everybody to hear.
