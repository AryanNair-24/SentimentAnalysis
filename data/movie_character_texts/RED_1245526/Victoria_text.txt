103) 1) dialog: (English accent) Frank Moses.
103) 3) dialog: It's been a long time.
103) 5) dialog: Are you here to kill me? 73.
103) 7) dialog: Oh. ...and sets aside the HIGH CAPACITY MACHINE PISTOL she was concealing behind the stack of napkins. VICTORIA (cont'd) Come on in, then. And tell Marvin to stand down before he gets hurt. Frank glances out the window where Marvin sits in her rose bushes covering the action.
104) 0) text: The others filter in and Joe and Victoria embrace.
104) 1) dialog: Joseph.
104) 3) dialog: You old snake charmer. Sarah looks between them all, a little lost.
104) 8) dialog: Just mind the daisies.
105) 0) text: Frank and Victoria sit alone as she peers through reading glasses, expertly working on Frank's shoulder with forcep and a sponge.
105) 1) dialog: I'd better hurry this along or I'll be late with four o'clock tea. Frank studies her, impressed.
105) 3) dialog: What?
105) 5) dialog: I try. But it's not easy. Sometimes I get restless. (confessing) I still take the occasional contract on the side.
105) 7) dialog: (hesitates, guilty) I can't seem to stop. I miss the rush. They retire us, but you can't just flip a switch and become someone else, you know. She starts stitching up Frank's shoulder.
105) 9) dialog: We did them for good reasons. A beat.
105) 11) dialog: Tell me about Sarah. Frank looks uncomfortable: much more so then when she was pulling lead out of him.
105) 13) dialog: It's one of the reasons I've always been so fond of you, Francis: you're a romantic.
105) 15) dialog: Hard on the outside. Gooey on the inside.
105) 17) dialog: Gooey.
106) 0) text: Marvin, Joe, Frank, Sarah and Victoria sit around the coffee table with papers and a laptop. Other guests chat quietly in the background.
106) 6) dialog: You know, business is a little slow right now... Frank smiles wide.
111) 0) text: Sarah lies in the dirt beside Victoria who sets up a camo draped rifle almost as tall as she is.
111) 2) dialog: He thought it would be safer and I thought it would be fun to have a little girl time; get to know each other, talk about the boys. Plus I wanted you to know that in all the years I've known Francis, I've never seen him like this, so if you break his heart, I'll kill you and bury your body in the woods. Sarah looks at her, stunned. Victoria smiles. 79. VICTORIA (cont'd) This is going to be fun.
113) 41) dialog: We have major activity on the perimeter. Somebody serious is setting up shop. Dunning smiles at Frank, cocky once again.
114) 0) text: Victoria lies dead still, sighting through her scope as Sarah fidgets nervously.
114) 2) dialog: So how did you two meet? This isn't what she expected, but Sarah allows herself to be deflected. 83.
114) 4) dialog: I was in love once, with an agent.
114) 6) dialog: The relationship wasn't sanctioned. When it came to light, my loyalty was questioned. I was told to kill him. It was a test. She says it all so matter of factly. Sarah looks at her stunned.
114) 8) dialog: I put three rounds in his chest.
116) 3) dialog: They have sniper positions on North, West, and East sides. (more) 84. VICTORIA (V.0.) (cont'd) Ground personnel in force out front and backup in the rear. I'd estimate sixty total. The phone on the desk begins to RING. Frank picks it up.
121) 0) text: Victoria lies prone, coolly squeezing off round after round keeping the sniper teams scrambling for cover.
121) 1) dialog: Now isn't this worth sitting ina hole for? Sarah looks at her like she's insane. VICTORIA (cont'd) Keep an eye on the boys. When they make cover, we move. Suddenly they're taking SMALL ARMS FIRE. Victoria whips around, firing back, pulling Sarah up and pushing her into a run.
124) 0) text: Sarah runs just ahead of Victoria, crashing through the forest... ...Straight into the arms of a black-clad COMMANDO. He pins her, covering her mouth as his three partners cover the woods behind her, scoping for Victoria. ...but there is nothing but SILENCE.
125) 0) text: Frank slips over the wall, Marvin just behind him. Sneaking up the perimeter, they suddenly raise weapons... ...and Victoria slips from the shadows with her rifle.
125) 1) dialog: They have Sarah. Frank turns back to the estate wall: he's going over. VICTORIA (cont'd) You can't. (beat) How many are you willing to kill? SOUNDS RISE as people crash through the underbrush behind them. Up the road, other forces are closing in. VICTORIA (cont'd) Live to fight another day, Francis. Sickened, Frank knows she's right.
127) 6) dialog: Hello Ivan. It's good to see you. Frank looks between them.
127) 8) dialog: Life, sometimes, is complicated. 90.
128) 5) dialog: Does anyone want to discuss the fact that we're all dead?
128) 7) dialog: The CIA's being used as the Vice President's personal hit squad. It's a bit of a conversation crusher. Ivan holds up the pitcher.
128) 10) dialog: I don't think it's possible to outrun this. It's only a matter of time until they find us.
128) 15) dialog: Veritas vos liberabit. The truth will set you free.
128) 17) dialog: It's a thought.

143) 0) text: Victoria enters, garnering appreciative looks as she make her way to the ballroom.
143) 2) dialog: Oh, of course. Removing her heavy multi-strand necklace, she places it in a velvet tray held by a deferential young woman, then steps through cleanly.
143) 4) dialog: Thank you so much.
143) 7) dialog: The pleasure is all mine. 102.
146) 10) dialog: scanning the crowd, waiting... ...and suddenly there is an arm around her, sweeping her around and onto the dance floor.
146) 12) dialog: Moves like that could get you killed.
146) 14) dialog: Almost. He leads a turn and spin which she executes perfectly. Ivan smiles wide. VICTORIA (cont'd) What are you grinning at? 105.
146) 16) dialog: Vice President.
146) 18) dialog: Really.
146) 20) dialog: The song, Ivan. It's over.
146) 22) dialog: Ivan! He looks back and fumblingly she tries to hand him a smal spray canister from her clutch.
146) 25) dialog: makes her way to the main ballroom doors, pulling them closed. Stepping out, she calls back into the room.
146) 26) dialog: Gas! Oh my God! I smell GAS! 106.
148) 0) text: As SCREAMS RISE inside, Victoria pulls her necklace apart into individual cable loops, wrapping them through the handles of all the ballroom doors and clipping them shut, locking everyone inside.
151) 0) text: A LONE Secret Service AGENT stands before this elevator, trying to follow the action on his ear-piece. Victoria appears at the far end of the hall.
151) 2) dialog: I'm sure I'm allowed.
151) 4) dialog: (amused ) Put that away. Do you know who I am?
151) 6) dialog: Look at this dress. Where, exactly, is the threat? The agent looks her over as she puts up her hands and closes the rest of the distance and... WHAM: the gun is twisted out of his hand as he takes a chop to the side of the neck and goes down. Victoria takes a moment to fix her boobs as Marvin enters the hall with two duffel bags. They step into the elevator, she inserts a fireman's key, and hits G.
152) 2) dialog: ... blazing away with a belt-fed machine gun. Behind her, Marvin fires bolts into the concrete, setting something up.
158) 0) text: Cooper's team angles in behind Victoria and Marvin's position, one row of cars back, listening to the FIRE.
161) 2) dialog: In a side corridor. She empties the magazine and he hands her another as they watch kitchen workers scatter and the Secret Service return fire.
161) 4) dialog: Me too. But suddenly they're taking fire from behind, bullets SLAPPING in to the wall around them. Marvin ducks, drawing a machine pistol and spraying the corridor.
161) 6) dialog: We have a problem, Marvin. He looks over. Victoria's on the floor, her dress awash in blood from a gunshot wound in her side. Marvin's instantly in motion, delving into a duffel bag, pulling cans of smoke, yanking pins, tossing them out. 111. With smoke adding a new layer of confusion to the SHOUTIN and GUNFIRE, he picks up Victoria, heading up a different corridor. He hustles forward as fast as he can, but the SOUNDS OF PURSUIT rise behind him. Marvin fires back down the hall, then pulls open a door revealing a utility closet and leans her inside. VICTORIA (cont'd) What the hell?
161) 8) dialog: Good luck. He gives her a wink.
161) 10) text: Victoria takes off her shoes, pulls Marvin's jacket tight around her and tries to stand up.
163) 0) text: Victoria makes her way forward, weak but deliberate, her breathing fast and shallow. Rounding a corner she finds herself at a steel security gate pulled across the concrete corridor. SHOUTS and FOOTSTEPS rise behind her. Defeated, she presses her face against the cold metal.

164) 2) dialog: stand among the refugee guests, onlookers, and emergency workers, watching from a distance as the car disappears into the night.
