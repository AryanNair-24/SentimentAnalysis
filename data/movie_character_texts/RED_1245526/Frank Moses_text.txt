2) 0) text: Like the rest of the house, the living room is only nominally furnished: a sofa, lamp, and a shelf of records Frank cranks out a set of pushups. Frank cranks out jumping jacks. Frank cranks out sit-ups. Not crunches... sit-ups.

From a small case, the leader takes out a full syringe. The second reaches past him with a snoop scope linked to his heads up display: the hall is clear, the door at the far end swinging closed. They move silently into the hall, listening to the WATER RUN: the leader with the syringe, the second empty-handed ready for the take down, the third with a machine pistol. The bathroom door stands ajar, spilling out bright light. The commandos lift their night-vision as they move down the hall, past the guest room, closing in. WHAM! They kick in the door revealing... ...the empty bathroom... ...as Frank steps out of the darkened guest room behind them in his robe and bare feet. The three men whip around, startled... WHAP! The commando closest to Frank goes down. 9. The second swings, but his legs are swept from under him, Frank's heel crushing his throat as he hits the floor. The leader lunges with the syringe, but it's twisted out of his hand and suddenly in his arm... plunger pressed. Staring at Frank, the commando's eyes flutter and drop. Frank is left standing alone amidst the bodies. He isn't even breathing hard. He crouches down, looking them over without emotion.

82) 0) text: Frank and Sarah enter and make their way through the huge four-story atrium, towards the high-security elevators. An armed guard looks them over. Sarah forces a smile.

82) 4) dialog: Actually it's more like hope.
83) 0) text: Stepping inside, Frank punches in a security code and the button for the 5th floor. The door slides closed and the wall-mounted retinal scann lights up as Sarah opens the case, removing a single gold contact lens, laser-etched with an elaborate pattern. 61. Frank bends close and she puts the contact...
83) 2) dialog: What?
83) 5) dialog: Gently.
83) 8) dialog: I don't know how long... An ALARM suddenly sounds.
83) 14) dialog: I don't begin to know what to say about that.
84) 0) text: Frank leads Sarah to a heavy steel door with an elaborate electronic number pad/scanner beside it.
84) 2) dialog: Did you know these locks cost eighty- five thousand dollars each?
84) 4) dialog: God love forced low-bid government contracts. He tapes a single sheet of paper over the hole in the wall: "SECURITY IS EVERYONE'S BUSINESS." Pushing open the door reveals a small, high-tech room with a lone computer terminal. 63.
85) 0) text: Sarah sits at the computer with Frank behind her, watchin her fly through files and directories.
85) 2) dialog: Depending on what they charge you with, either life in prison or death.
85) 4) dialog: Work the assignment tree back and see if you can find the executive. A few keystrokes later, she brings up Cooper's photograph and profile. FRANK (cont'd) I want everything on this guy.
88) 0) text: BOOM! Frank kicks open the door, bursting inside. Thomas makes it to his feet before his face is bounced into the desk and he hits the floor unconscious. Frank looks at Cooper across the room, still on the phone
88) 1) dialog: You. Cooper stares. He almost laughs.
88) 3) dialog: What did they pull out of Afghanistan?
88) 5) dialog: Actually, I figured I'd have to beat it out of some snot-nosed button-pusher. Frank swings on him, but Cooper blocks and counters. In a flurry of fists, Frank is hit once and then again. Face bloodied, he stumbles back, stunned. Cooper smiles.
88) 7) dialog: Kordesky trained you?
88) 9) dialog: I taught Kordesky. Frank brutally twists his arm, tighter.
88) 12) dialog: Who ordered these hits? Cooper glares back at him.
88) 15) dialog: You come after one of your own and you don't even ask why?
88) 17) dialog: The minute you learned who I was you should have walked away. Gasping, Cooper wrenches out a reply.
89) 0) text: Frank's hit in the shoulder and the side, in pain, forcin himself down the stairs. Stepping into the 4th floor hall, he pulls the first fire alarm he sees. As ALARMS RING, he presses forward through the rapidly filling corridor and catches a woman by the arm:
89) 1) dialog: Where's the server room?
90) 0) text: Rows of servers fill this clean room, but Frank ignores them, arriving at the "FIRE CONTROL ROOM" off to one side
92) 0) text: As ALARMS CONTINUE TO RING, Sarah is frog-marched by two tactical badasses down this hall, hands zip-cuffed behind her back. 67. Rounding a corner, they are suddenly right in front of Frank standing beside a Halon canister with a fire axe. Frank takes a deep breath and swings, snapping the valve. PRESSURIZED GAS ERUPTS and suddenly Sarah and her escorts are writhing on the ground gasping for air that doesn't seem to be there. Frank wades in, cuts Sarah's zip cuffs and picks her up.
93) 0) text: Frank drags Sarah up the stairs.
93) 1) dialog: Breathe out then in. You're fine. Just breathe. Gasping, she follows his directions, gaining control.
93) 3) dialog: Do you have the download? She pulls a memory stick from her bra.
94) 2) dialog: It binds up oxygen in the air. Kicking it over he gets it rolling and... SMASH! The canister breaks through the glass panel under the railing, falls three stories and... 68.
95) 0) text: Cooper stands outside the HQ buildings, scanning faces as people stream out, desperately searching for Frank. But PULLING BACK reveals there are THOUSANDS of workers flooding from the buildings. It's hopeless.
96) 0) text: Frank and Sarah separate from the crowd, Frank leaning heavily on Sarah as they make their way towards the townc at the back of the lot. Marvin's behind the wheel, ramrod stiff, sunglasses on, staring straight ahead.
96) 2) dialog: Hold up! The back window rolls down revealing... ...JOE MATHESON. Frank can't believe it. FRANK (cont'd) Joe!
96) 4) dialog: Yeah. I know. (beat) You okay, Marvin?
96) 7) dialog: I thought you were dead.
99) 2) dialog: You must be talking to someone important. Cooper goes cold. FRANK (V.0.) (cont'd) I was just calling to let you know there's a new list. And you're right at the top. CLICK. The line goes dead.
100) 0) text: Frank closes the phone.
100) 4) dialog: I know a place.
102) 1) dialog: I'll go in alone, see if we can stay.
102) 3) dialog: It'll be fine. Frank and Marvin exchange a look.
102) 5) dialog: Wouldn't make any difference.
103) 0) text: Frank enters, the bell on the door JINGLING brightly. The place is adorable. VICTORIA sits in the dining room folding napkins. A littl older than Frank, she's prim, proper, and beautiful. She looks up, surprised. Then smiles.
103) 2) dialog: Victoria.
103) 4) dialog: Yeah. There's a beat between them.
103) 6) dialog: No. I need your help. He slowly opens his jacket, revealing no weapons, but a lot of blood. She sighs, possibly disappointed...
103) 8) dialog: By the way, your roses are fabulous.
104) 6) dialog: (aside) Killer. Very dangerous. Sarah smiles at Victoria, uneasy. She smiles back, warmly 74.
105) 0) text: Frank and Victoria sit alone as she peers through reading glasses, expertly working on Frank's shoulder with forcep and a sponge.
105) 2) dialog: How did you do it?
105) 4) dialog: Make the transition? You have a beautiful place here. A nice quiet life. You seem so at ease. He winces as Victoria extracts the bullet.
105) 6) dialog: You do?
105) 8) dialog: I didn't know what to do with myself. All I ever had was work. (more) 75. FRANK (cont'd) And suddenly there was so much time. (beat) I've done so many terrible things.
105) 10) dialog: Maybe. I'm starting to wonder.
105) 12) dialog: She makes me feel like maybe I could have a different life. Like normal people. Victoria smiles.
105) 14) dialog: What?
105) 16) dialog: Get outta here.
106) 0) text: Marvin, Joe, Frank, Sarah and Victoria sit around the coffee table with papers and a laptop. Other guests chat quietly in the background.

107) 0) text: Cooper sits in his suburban living room, reading Frank's file as his wife, ELIZABETH, walks in, dressed for bed.
108) 0) text: Sarah stands on the balcony, looking out at the water. In the room behind her, Frank's cleaning his .45, but she can feel his eyes on her.
108) 2) dialog: I was just wondering how you're holding up. TI know it's a lot. Sarah smiles.
108) 4) dialog: Hide and go set up somewhere else? She nods. FRANK (cont'd) Dragging you along on this, I think about it. But letting this happen, then and now, I can't. She comes inside, picking up the cot that has been wedged into the room and moving it along one wall.
108) 6) dialog: Don't be silly.
108) 8) dialog: I don't understand.
110) 0) text: Frank sits with his back against a tree as Marvin checks it out with binoculars. They're both clad in black.
113) 4) dialog: Put them with the others. Dunning looks between them angrily as Frank cuffs him into his chair.
113) 6) dialog: You don't remember me? (beat ) I remember you. 80.
113) 9) dialog: Tell us what happened in Afghanistan. A beat as this registers.
113) 11) dialog: We have any idea what we're dealing with?
113) 13) dialog: Can we touch him?
113) 17) dialog: I like this one. Where'd you get it? Dunning stares in fear.
113) 19) dialog: No kidding. Frank holds out the torch and Marvin puts a pair of Vice Grips in the flame.
113) 22) dialog: What did you take out of there?
113) 28) dialog: The Vice President of the United States? Dunning nods.
113) 30) dialog: He was responsible for what happened there?
113) 32) dialog: What did you tell her?
113) 34) dialog: Then you called the Vice President.
113) 39) dialog: He ordered everyone killed. Except you.
116) 6) dialog: Learn anything about how to be an agent yet? Cooper's calm and even, pacing as he talks.
116) 8) dialog: I expect so.
116) 10) dialog: I didn't start this.
116) 12) dialog: They're coming from the Vice President. He ordered these hits to cover up war crimes he committed in Afghanistan in September 1981. (beat) I buried the bodies in '81. They have you doing it now. You're killing everyone who was there. Cooper doesn't bat an eye. 85.
116) 14) dialog: If you did, would it matter? Cooper thinks it over, weighing it out.
116) 16) dialog: So what do you propose to do about that?
116) 18) dialog: Sure I will. Even if you brought me in, someone would just put a bullet in my head.
116) 20) dialog: If you actually believe that, you're even more naive than I thought.
117) 0) text: Frank watches Marvin laying out his numerous weapons. Joe puts a hand on Frank's shoulder.
117) 2) dialog: Yeah. 86.
118) 1) dialog: Hold your fire, I'm coming out. Frank hangs up.
118) 3) text: He turns, reeling, realizing Frank was right: he's not in control of this situation. Cooper draws his weapon and charges towards the house. Frank lies motionless on the walkway. Cooper rolls the body over. It's Joe Matheson, dressed in Frank's clothes. He's dead. 87. PUSH IN on Cooper. Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from the back of the house, and RADIOS ARE SCREAMING.

127) 2) dialog: How. ..? The Russian smiles wide.
127) 7) dialog: Did he just call you... bunny?
128) 2) dialog: To Joe. Everyone raises their glasses.

133) 7) dialog: I keep going over in my head if I was ever like you: the blind ambition and misplaced trust. I don't know. 96.
133) 9) dialog: It might help me decide what to do next.
133) 11) dialog: There's a lot of hard things about our business. But in all my years, it wasn't the killing, or the stress, or the pay that bothered me. I didn't even realize what it was until it was too late. Cooper looks at Thomas who whispers...
133) 14) dialog: It's how anything you love can be used against you. It taught me never to invest. Never to care. (beat ) Once I became Frank Moses I lived my entire life without attachments. It took discipline, but I was damn good at it. (beat) And then I met Sarah. And now you have her. It's the worst thing in the world to know that your enemies could hurt the ones you love. The feeling of powerlessness is almost indescribable. Cooper sits back, smug.
133) 16) dialog: You there, Cooper? 97.
133) 18) dialog: It's just like I said, isn't it: almost indescribable. Cooper looks like a shell of a man.
133) 20) dialog: Shut up! It's time to grow up and look at what's going on.
133) 22) dialog: Listen carefully. This is the part I was talking about where I'm not sure you have what it takes to understand. As the others shout orders behind him, Cooper listens, riveted. FRANK (cont'd) I've spent my life doing terrible things for the CIA because I believed what I was doing was right. But when you find out that you've been a tool for corrupt political ends, like I was in Afghanistan, and like you're are now, you have to take a stand. This is a stain on our souls, Cooper. There's a long beat.
133) 24) dialog: The right thing. The moral thing. The thing you'd do yourself if you had any balls at all. (more) 98. FRANK (cont'd) (pause) I'm going to kill the Vice President. A reaction ripples through the room: oh shit. FRANK (cont'd) But my question, Cooper, is this. What are you going to do? CLICK. The line goes dead. Cooper sits shell-shocked.
136) 0) text: A rusty door rolls up revealing Frank and Marvin peering into this storage unit full of cheap dusty cabinets. Pulling them open reveals a trove of rifles, machine guns grenade launchers and mortars. 99. Marvin looks at Frank.
136) 2) dialog: Back in '78 I thought I'd put a few things aside, you know, just in case. Opening a locker, Frank pulls out a pair of vintage aviators and tries them on.
136) 4) dialog: Just past the ammo. Marvin opens a locker: blocks of C-4, detonators, and primer-cord.
144) 0) text: Cooper stands looking out the windows as introductory remarks drone on behind him. Pedestrians pass back and forth outside, but something catches his attention in the distance. A FIGURE stands across the street, watching the hotel. His collar's up and he's wearing a hat, but in the headlights of a passing car... ...it's Frank. Cooper's instantly running, yelling into his radio.
145) 0) text: Bursting from the hotel, Cooper races down the steps, gun out as he plows into traffic. Jackson and Thomas run after their boss, closing the gap until they reach him at the corner where the figure was. Cooper's looking around wildly, but there's no one there, no one retreating, nothing. Except... on a window ledge where Frank was standing, there's a single .45 caliber cartridge. Cooper picks it up, staring at the bullet...
155) 0) text: Sipping the drink, he calmly makes his way to the elevators, tapping twice on the second one from the left. The doors roll open revealing Frank dressed ina conservative suit and tie.

165) 2) dialog: Frank Moses. (beat) One of the men you ordered killed. The Vice President looks at him in fear.
165) 4) dialog: From you? Nothing. 115. Stanton senses this is bad.
165) 6) dialog: So now it's coming back to you? Stanton pipes down. FRANK (cont'd) Or have there been so many that they all just blur together? Maybe you don't even think about it. (beat) I was prepared to live my life in peace. You couldn't even let me have that.
165) 8) dialog: Afghanistan. I was there. Stanton suddenly looks like he's been gut-punched. Like he's about to be sick.
165) 10) dialog: You can talk all you want. Frank slowly pulls over into a deserted lot near an industrial waterfront area beneath the El tracks. FRANK (cont'd) But I'm still going to kill you.
166) 1) dialog: On your knees. The VP crawls up, coming apart, on the verge of tears.
166) 3) dialog: It's not that I want revenge. I don't care about you. But there are rules about how you treat your tools. The people who do things for you do it because they believe in the greater good. Frank holds up his set of dog tags. Now we see that the name and number have been filed out. FRANK (cont'd) I joined up when I was seventeen and took an oath to defend this country. They stamped these tags with the name my mother gave me. Later the Company erased that name forever. These are a symbol of that sacrifice. A train goes by overhead with a deafening ROAR. Frank levels his gun at the Vice President. FRANK (cont'd) Today I am going to restore honor to your office. Suddenly bright lights pin Frank.
166) 5) dialog: I guess I'm okay with that. He starts to move, but Cooper pulls Sarah from the car, covering her with his weapon. She and Frank lock eyes. So close but so far. 117. He looks between her and the VP. FRANK (cont'd) I love you.
166) 7) dialog: She goes free. Cooper nods. FRANK (cont'd) Swear it on your family's life.
166) 26) dialog: Maybe there's some hope for the Company after all.
166) 28) dialog: Home?
166) 30) dialog: I'm retired. Cooper watches them walk away.
167) 0) text: Frank and Sarah kiss... And Ivan leans back, totally interrupting.
