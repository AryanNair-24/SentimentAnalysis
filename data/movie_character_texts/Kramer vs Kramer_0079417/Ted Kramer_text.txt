57) 19) dialog: How should I know?
57) 22) dialog: So... what's so terrible about that?
57) 24) dialog: No. No, I don't believe it. Jim  O'Connor would never let anything  like that happen. He gave me my shot  in this business. If it wasn't for  Jim O'Connor I'd be В– I don't know  where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...

62) 16) dialog: (he puts his arm around  Billy and holds him  close) Oh, Christ... Oh, Christ... (he thinks for a  moment, then:) No, pal. Your mom loves you very  much. The reason she left didn't  have anything to do with you. (pause, this is very  painful) Look, I don't know if this will make  any sense to you, okay? But I'll try  and explain. You see the reason your  mom left was because... Well, I guess  it was because I kept trying to make  her into a certain kind of person...  Make her be the way I thought a wife  was supposed to be. Only she wasn't  like that. She was... (smiles to himself) Well, she wasn't like that. And now,  when I think about it, I can see she  tried very hard to be like I wanted  В– very hard. And when she couldn't,  then she tried to tell me about it.  Only I wouldn't listen. I guess I  thought that if I was happy, that  meant she was happy too. Only she  wasn't. The truth is, the only reason  she didn't leave a lot sooner was  because she loves you so much. Joanna  stayed until she couldn't stand me  any longer and then she left... But  it wasn't you, pal. It wasn't you.

Although we do not see the stitches being made, we do SEE the doctor's hand, wit the needle and surgical thread as it moves into and out o view with a slow, steady rhythm. Billy's hand clutches Te so tightly that the knuckles are white.

85) 13) text: Ted is already on his feet and halfway out the door.
85) 14) dialog: You bet your ass.
86) 3) dialog: So, Mr. Ackerman, as you can see  from my resume, my experience in  setting up the leisure package concept  means that I've spent a lot of time  working along the same lines as your  multiple buys and your regional  advertising ideas. I know the  pitfalls, but В– and this is more  important В– I know the potential  revenue for the company inherent in  these programs.
86) 7) dialog: (leaning forward) Mr. Ackerman, is there anyone else  that I should see before you come to  a decision.
86) 9) dialog: (no time to waste) Could I see him right away?
86) 11) text: He gets to his feet, starts to shake Ted's hand, ready to end the interview.

88) 11) dialog: (a deep breath, then  a real huckster) All right, I'll tell you what I'm  gonna do В– I'll take the job at twenty- two-five. Now, that's twenty-five  hundred less than you're offering.  The only thing is, you have to say  yes right now. Not tomorrow. Not  next week. Not after the holidays.  It's worth it to me for a yes right  now and I'll take twenty-five hundred  less.

92) 6) dialog: (doubtful) I don't know, John... I mean, to be  brutally honest, I'm not so sure  what kind of mental shape Joanna's  in right now. Y'know she admitted  she was seeing a shrink.
92) 8) dialog: No, but В–
93) 14) text: Ted stands helpless, watching them leave.
93) 16) text: Ted, now almost lost from view on the crowded street, sti hasn't moved.
93) 18) text: Ted and Phyllis, getting ready to go to bed. They look li a couple that has been married at least five years. Ted i busy talking as he takes off his tie, jacket and starts t unbutton his shirt. Phyllis is getting undressed also, ha things in the closet, putting things away in drawers. But Ted continues to talk, she watches him apprehensively, it clear that something is wrong.
93) 19) dialog: (he has become an  armchair lawyer) So, naturally, you assume that since  Joanna left, that would be a  compelling point against her, right?
93) 21) dialog: But it doesn't work that way. A major  decision was handed down by the  Appellate Court in 1969 В– in the  case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
93) 23) dialog: Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court  ruled in favor of the mother, thus  establishing a precedent for awarding  the child to the mother even though  she previously abandoned the baby.

95) 7) dialog: (embarrassed at being  caught) Oh, yeah...

97) 4) dialog: Right.
98) 3) dialog: (pleased) You like it?
98) 6) text: Ted nods, walks over to the desk and begins collecting  paperwork to do over the weekend. As he does, Billy goes  through the office, sitting in every chair, looking in ev drawer.
98) 8) dialog: Yep.
98) 10) dialog: Uh huh...
98) 12) dialog: Sure.
98) 13) text: Billy plops himself down in Ted's chair, swivels around.
98) 15) dialog: No, she never did.
98) 17) dialog: I don't know. I hadn't thought much  about it.
98) 19) dialog: (shaking his head) No.
98) 22) text: Ted stops what he is doing, looks across at Billy:
98) 23) dialog: No, son. Daddy and mommy will never  get remarried.
102) 1) text: As Ted, now fully dressed, wearing a dark blue suit, whit shirt, conservative tie, leans over Billy and wakes him.
105) 1) text: It is a bleak January morning, the streets around the  courthouse are mobbed with people on their way to work. W SEE Ted Kramer, a tiny figure among hundreds, coming out the subway. He crosses the street and starts up the steps the large and forbidding courthouse.
106) 1) text: As Ted gets off the elevator and starts down the corridor toward the courtroom. In the f.g., В– standing by the doo the courtroom itself is John Shaunessy, he greets Ted, th shake hands and talk together for a moment. Then, as they enter the courtroom:
107) 7) text: The lawyer leans across to Ted.
107) 9) text: As Joanna gets to her feet, crosses to the witness stand is sworn in. Note: Throughout the following, we continually CROSS-CUT Ted Kramer, leaning forward, listening intently. It becom evident that, in spite of himself, there are moments he f great compassion for Joanna.
107) 108) text: As Shaunessy sits down next to Ted.
107) 109) dialog: (leaning over, in a  whisper) Jesus Christ. Did you have to be so  rough on her?
108) 1) text: Ted sits at the dining table poring over law books, writi copious notes on a legal pad. Billy sits across from him  drawing in a pad with magic markers. HOLD FOR A BEAT as B looks up at his father. It is clear that something is  bothering him.
108) 3) dialog: (not looking up) Uh, huh?
108) 5) dialog: (still involved in  his books) I guess about the same kind of things  you do.
108) 7) dialog: (distracted) Uh, uh... We didn't have television  then.
108) 11) dialog: Nope. It hadn't been invented yet.
108) 14) dialog: Yeah, there was apple juice.
108) 16) dialog: Uh, uh. There was no such a thing as  Burger King.
108) 19) dialog: Well, let's see... There wasn't  McDonald's. And there wasn't  astronauts... And there wasn't frozen  yogurt. And there wasn't...
111) 3) dialog: (speaking quietly) When Joanna В– (to the judge,  correcting himself) В– my ex-wife В– when she was talking  before about how unhappy she was  during our marriage... Well, I guess  most of what she said was probably  true. There were a lot of things I  didn't understand В– a lot of things  I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of  things Joanna wishes she could  change... But we can't. Some things,  once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy. I believe  she does. So do I. But the way it  was explained to me, that's not the  issue. The only thing that's supposed  to matter here is what's best for  Billy... When Joanna said why  shouldn't a woman have the same  ambitions as a man, I suppose she's  right. But by the same token what  law is it that says a woman is a  better parent simply by virtue of  her sex? I guess I've had to think a  lot about whatever it is that makes  somebody a good parent: constancy,  patience, understanding... love.  Where is it written that a man has  any less of those qualities than a  woman? Billy has a home with me,  I've tried to make it the best I  could. It's not perfect. I'm not a  perfect parent. (unconsciously echoing  something Joanna  said earlier) I don't have enough patience.  Sometimes I forget he's just a little  kid... But I love him... More than  anything in this world I love him.
111) 7) dialog: I suppose.
111) 12) dialog: (not losing his cool) Technically, the agency lost a big  account and seventy four people were  let go. I was one of them.
111) 14) dialog: Yes, but I'm with J. Walter Thompson  now. I don't think that will happen  again.
112) 1) text: Shaunessy and Ted stand talking, reviewing the case. Then the two men shake hands, the lawyer waves goodbye, turns starts back into the building. THE CAMERA PANS WITH TED a he walks toward the main exit.
