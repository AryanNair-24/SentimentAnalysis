74) 37) dialog: (she will be heard) Ted, all my life I'd either been  somebody's daughter or somebody's  wife, or somebody else's mother.  Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty- two-year-old, highly neurotic woman  who had just walked out on her husband  and child. I went to California  because that was about as far away  as I could get. Only... I guess it  wasn't far enough. So I started going  to a shrink. (leaning forward,  very sincere) Ted, I've had time to think. I've  been through some changes. I've  learned a lot about myself.

107) 13) dialog: The first couple, yes, but after  that it became increasingly difficult.
107) 15) dialog: No, I did not.
107) 17) dialog: Yes. I tried to talk to Ted В– my ex- husband В– about it, but he wouldn't  listen. He refuses to discuss it in  any serious way. I remember one time  he said I probably couldn't get a  job that would pay enough to hire a  baby-sitter for Billy.
107) 19) dialog: Yes, I work for Jantzen as a  sportswear designer.
107) 21) dialog: I make thirty-one thousand dollars a  year.
107) 24) dialog: (emphatically) Yes. Very much.
107) 27) dialog: (speaking carefully,  with great thought) Yes... Look, during the last five  years we were married, I had... I  was getting more and more... unhappy,  more and more frustrated. I needed  to talk to somebody. I needed to  find out if it was me, if I was going  crazy or what. But every time I turned  to Ted В– my ex-husband, he couldn't  handle it. He became very... I don't  know, very threatened. I mean,  whenever I would bring up anything  he would act like it was some kind  of personal attack. Anyway, we became  more and more separate... more and  more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I  had to leave. And because of my ex- husband's attitude В– his unwillingness  to deal with my feelings, I had come  to have almost no self-esteem... (with feeling) At the time I left, I sincerely  believed that there was something  wrong with me В– that my son would be  better off without me. It was only  when I got to California and started  into therapy I began to realize I  wasn't a terrible person. And that  just because I needed some creative  and emotional outlet other than my  child, that didn't make me unfit to  be a mother.
107) 31) dialog: Because my son is here. And his father  is here. As a mother, I don't want  my child to be separated from his  father.
107) 34) dialog: Because he's my child... Because I  love him. I know I left my son, I  know that's a terrible thing to do.  Believe me, I have to live with that  every day of my life. But just because  I'm a woman, don't I have a right to  the same hopes and dreams as a man?  Don't I have a right to a life of my  own? Is that so awful? Is my pain  any less just because I'm a woman?  Are my feelings any cheaper? I left  my child В– I know there is no excuse  for that. But since then, I have  gotten help. I have worked hard to  become a whole human being. I don't  think I should be punished for that.  I don't think my son should be  punished for that. Billy's only six.  He needs me. I'm not saying he doesn't  need his father, but he needs me  more. I'm his mother.

107) 61) dialog: (looks toward Gressen  for help) I don't recall.
107) 66) dialog: (almost a whisper) Somewhere in between.
107) 71) dialog: (in a whisper) Yes.
107) 73) dialog: (by now she is becoming  thoroughly rattled) I... I don't know...
107) 82) dialog: (rattled) Ah... I guess I'd have to say...  with my child.
107) 84) dialog: (reluctantly) I suppose...
107) 86) dialog: (louder) Yes.
107) 88) dialog: We were married two years before the  baby. And then four very difficult  years.
107) 92) dialog: I was not a failure.
107) 94) dialog: (so angry she forgets  her cool) I consider it less my failure than  his.
107) 98) dialog: Who sits silently.
107) 100) dialog: (whisper) It did not succeed.

132) 2) text: The lobby is dark, the only light coming from the window. Joanna sits off to one side, wearing sunglasses. She look up as Ted approaches, a small smile on her face.
132) 4) dialog: Ted, do you love him?
132) 6) dialog: (insistent) Ted, do you love him?
132) 8) dialog: I love him too... I don't think I  ever knew how much until now.
132) 10) dialog: (a deep breath, then:) Ted, when we got married it was  because I was twenty-seven years old  and I thought I should get married  and... when I had Billy it was because  I thought I should have a baby...  and I guess all I did was mess up my  life and your life and В–
132) 12) dialog: (urgent) Please... Please don't stop me. This  is the hardest thing I've ever had  to do..
132) 14) dialog: After I left... when I was in  California, I began to think, what  kind of mother was I that I could  walk out on my own child. It got to  where I couldn't tell anybody about  Billy В– I couldn't stand that look  in their faces when I said he wasn't  living with me. Finally it seemed  like the most important thing in the  world to come back here and prove to  Billy and to me and to the world how  much I loved him... And I did... And  I won. Only... it was just another  "should." (she begins to break  down) ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing  everything you did, everything you  went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I  love him, or how much you love him.  I guess it's like you said, the only  thing that counts is what's best for  Billy. I don't know, maybe that's  all love is anyway... Ted, I think  Billy should stay with you...
132) 16) dialog: (she reaches out,  takes his hand) He's already got one mother, he  doesn't need two... He's yours... (her last ounce of  reserve crumbles) I won't fight you for him any more.  He's yours...
132) 18) dialog: Only can I still see him?
132) 20) text: Joanna's last ounce of reserve crumbles, she begins to so Ted puts his arms around her and holds her. They do not k Then, after a few moments she steps back.
132) 21) dialog: (chin high) Okay... I think I'll go talk to my  son now. (wiping her eyes) How do I look?
