54) 20) dialog: Hi. Nice to see you again. She hugs Mavis lightly.
54) 24) dialog: (to Buddy) Remember New Years in Dinkytown? Moon’s old place?
54) 30) dialog: Pardon me. We’re always eating around here.
54) 33) dialog: (friendly) Yeah? That’s a neat job. The baby suckles noisily. Beth gazes at her daughter tenderly. Mavis touches the baby’s head almost dutifully.
54) 35) dialog: She’s like a clone of Buddy. You should see his baby pictures next to her. She got the Slade nose, the Slade everything.
54) 37) dialog: Yes. Mavis examines the baby’s face.
54) 41) dialog: Can you bring me a Summer Ale? Mavis looks taken aback. Beth laughs.
54) 42) dialog: It’s fine, I can just pump and dump after the show. Don’t worry, I’m not trying to get my kid hammered.
54) 44) dialog: So, how are you? I know you’re a author. I saw that cool article about you in the Sun.
54) 47) dialog: Sure, babe. INT. BUDDY’S HOUSE - SAME They enter the house. It’s modest, but warm and artsy. Beth places the baby in an aquarium-themed contraption with flashing lights and dangling seashells.
54) 49) dialog: Ah yes, the Funquarium. Always chills her out. (to baby) Yes! You love it. (back to Mavis) We’re starting to get smiles. (CONTINUED)
54) 53) dialog: How's this?
54) 56) dialog: Goodwill.
54) 58) dialog: Oh yeah?
54) 66) dialog: A lot of my kids learn emotions cognitively. It doesn’t come naturally to them the way it does for you or me. So we need to show them: This is what happy looks like. This is what anxious looks like. And so on. Mavis is fascinated with the chart.
54) 68) dialog: That’s kind of how they are a lot of the time, so. Yeah. Don’t need to teach it. Buddy changes the subject.
54) 71) dialog: No pets? 52. Mavis seems to suddenly, guiltily remember Baguette.
54) 78) dialog: Two weeks and two days.
54) 80) dialog: Thanks. Uncomfortable silence fills the room.
55) 0) text: The baby sleeps in a car seat contraption. Buddy, Mavis and Beth eat burritos from Chipotle. Buddy pats one of the styrofoam take-out containers approvingly.
55) 3) dialog: I don’t think we’ve ever ordered from there, have we honey?
55) 5) dialog: (politely) Um, yeah, I guess I’ve only been here, like...nine years?
55) 10) dialog: Oh. Close by, actually. I grew up in East Duluth.
55) 12) dialog: (taken aback) We weren’t loaded. My dad was a podiatrist.
55) 16) dialog: Oh yeah? Where does he practice? Buddy cringes, knowing this is a sore subject.
55) 18) dialog: I’m sorry.
55) 24) dialog: (through a mouthful of food) Ooh! Babysitter’s here.
55) 27) dialog: I am dressed for the show. EXT. CHAMPION 0’ MALLEY’S - EVENING (TO ESTABLISH) There’s a modest line of people outside the bar, mostly in their 30s and 40s. INT. CHAMPION 0’ MALLEY’S - SAME We pan past a HOMEMADE FLYER advertising Beth’s band. It says “Nipple Confusion: Moms That Rock!” The four band members are pictured in a grid, Beatles-style. The band is tuning up on a tiny stage surrounded by brass rails. The lead singer, MARY ELLEN TRANTOWSKI, has tattoos on her arms and a cool (for Duluth) haircut. There’s also a bass player, a guitarist, and of course, Beth. She fusses with her drums, tightening them up with a key. (CONTINUED)
56) 0) text: From Mavis’s POV, we head toward a pair of double doors. Just outside the doors, we see a group of gossiping GIRLS wearing high-school uniforms. Only they’re not girls; they’re BETH’S FRIENDS. Mary Ellen glances at Mavis through the glass with a sneer. Mavis pushes through the doors.
56) 2) dialog: (laughing) I messed up the fill so bad on “Haircut.” I’m sorry guys.
56) 8) dialog: (affectionate) I think someone’s had a few too many.
56) 11) dialog: Aw, really? I want to stay out just a little while longer.
56) 14) dialog: (eager ) Really? Mary Ellen gives Mavis the once-over. Mavis notices the coldness of her stare. Beth may be oblivious, but nothing gets past Mary Ellen.
56) 19) dialog: (interrupting) Buddy, let Mavis drive you home, OK? I’m gonna stay and celebrate.
68) 68) dialog: Mavis? Are you okay?
68) 70) dialog: There’s some right here. She reaches for a PITCHER OF PUNCH, but is temporarily distracted by an OLDER RELATIVE.
68) 71) dialog: What? Oh no, she’s fine with Grandpa right now. Thank you, Uncle Bob. She turns back toward Mavis and accidentally BUMPS against a party guest. Most of the punch SPLASHES onto the front of Mavis’s minidress. Beth (CONT'D) (stammering) Oh! I’1l get something...
68) 77) dialog: I'll go get a rag.
68) 80) dialog: (quietly) You want to clean up, Mavis?
68) 100) dialog: He’s not. Mavis looks at Beth’s face. Her eyes are full of pity and concern. Still sympathetic!
