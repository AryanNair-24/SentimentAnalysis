35) 2) dialog: I’m sorry. I believe we attended high school together. In fact, we definitely did.
35) 4) dialog: Yes. You’re Mavis Gary?
35) 6) dialog: Oh. Congrats on that. (CONTINUED)
35) 10) dialog: Okay.
35) 12) dialog: Matt Freehauf. My locker was actually right next to yours. For all of high school. A flash of recognition. Embarrassment.
35) 15) dialog: Mm-hm. I was out for most of senior year, though. He taps the crutch, indicating a connection. Mavis smiles, but it’s horribly awkward.
35) 17) dialog: You may remember me as the “hate crime guy?” (off Mavis’s look) Bunch of jocks who thought I was gay jumped me in the woods and hit my legs and dick with a crowbar? It was national news. I mean, until people found out I wasn’t actually gay. Then it wasn’t a hate crime. It was just a fat guy getting his ass kicked. (CONTINUED)
35) 21) dialog: I even got my own prayer-a-thon, courtesy of the Lutheran Teen Club. 10 hours of Dear Heavenly Fathers and I can still only walk in circles.
35) 23) dialog: Not good. Mavis nods. The bartender pushes a second Maker’s towards her, and she accepts it with a long, grateful sip. Matt begins talking again, and she cringes. He sighs.
35) 24) dialog: It’s not like we ran in the same circles, regardless. You were extremely popular, if I recall. You won “Best Hair” in the senior superlatives. And I was, you know, a big theater fag.
35) 26) dialog: No. It’s an expression. Theater fag, drama geek.
35) 28) dialog: What are you even doing in town? I know you’re not one of the losers who stuck around.
35) 32) dialog: Aren’t you some kind of teen writer now? I read about it in the Sun. How’d you score that gig?
35) 34) dialog: No offense intended. I was just curious. It’s a cool job. Mavis takes another healthy swig from the glass and squints at Matt, suddenly deeming him worthy of honesty.
36) 0) text: Mavis is obviously drunk. Her body language is sloppy and she shouts over the music. She leans toward Matt conspiratorially.
36) 2) dialog: Careful. Mavis points to the bottle instructively. It’s a cheesy brand of alcoholic CIDER.
36) 6) dialog: That’s a good, uh, fact. (beat) So are you seeing your family while you’re here?
36) 8) dialog: Okay!
36) 11) dialog: (nodding) “My Girl.”
36) 13) dialog: That’s dark, Mavis. (CONTINUED)
36) 17) dialog: Thanks. Mavis has reached for a patch of hair behind her ear. She’s pulling at it compulsively, fingering the roots.
36) 19) dialog: Sure.
36) 21) dialog: (stage-whispering back) Okay!
37) 0) text: Mavis and MATT stand in the parking lot near the kitchen entrance. Mavis is SMOKING aggressively. As Matt moves further from the entrance, we can see how much effort it takes for him to walk, even with assistance. MATT leans on his crutch, waiting for Mavis to speak.
37) 2) dialog: Awesome. Buddy Slade. I’m pretty sure Buddy’s married. With a kid on the way. Mavis takes a drag. She smokes like a twelve-year-old. (CONTINUED)
37) 6) dialog: Wait, are you not joking?
37) 9) dialog: Um, I would advise you...Mavis? Mavis, look at me. Okay. I would advise you to keep all this to yourself. Talk to a therapist or something.
37) 13) dialog: Great. Hey, just don’t call Buddy Slade. Especially not tonight. Mavis sticks her finger into Matt’s chest, aggressively triumphant .
37) 16) dialog: Yeah, we called them, remember? (exasperated) Listen, Buddy already has a life. Without you. Mavis begins walking backward toward the car, lecturing to MATT as she stumbles.
45) 35) dialog: Mavis? He’s standing over her booth, leaning on his crutch. Mavis is not thrilled to see him.
45) 37) dialog: I work here. I do the books and deal with vendors and other sit- down jobs that won’t tax my twisted, mangled body. And you?
45) 39) dialog: Right. I see Buddy up there procuring a couple of mind- erasers. Not very dignified of you. Mavis refuses to break.
45) 44) dialog: Hi. Congratulations on the little one.
45) 49) dialog: Sadly, I must decline. I’ve got work to do, and it takes me twice as long as an able-bodied man to complete even the simplest task.
45) 51) dialog: I’1l just leave you two to your little Mercury High reunion.
45) 53) dialog: They changed their name to the Indians in ‘99. It was a whole thing with the local Fon du Lac and... (No one is listening) ...-whatever. MATT limps away. Buddy watches him sympathetically and takes a sip from the Hard Jack bottle. (CONTINUED)
47) 4) text: INT. MATT’S HOUSE - SAME Matt Freehauf shuffles over to a wall-mounted telephone in a depressing “country” kitchen that looks like it was remodeled in 1989. He picks it up.
47) 5) dialog: Hello? Mavis’s tone is sharp, teenage-bitchy.
47) 7) dialog: (annoyed) I got it, Sandra! (to Mavis) Mavis?
47) 9) dialog: The caller ID went (robot voice) Ma-vis Guh-ree.
47) 11) dialog: Oh. You’re not trying to destroy Buddy Slade’s marriage?
47) 13) dialog: You think? Why are you calling? Do you think I’m like the town crier, like I’m going to roam the streets like an old-timey newsboy? (boyish voice)
47) 17) dialog: “Hey everyone, Mavis Gary is back and she’s hatching a scheme!”
47) 19) dialog: Really? I think drunk people tend to tell the truth.
47) 22) dialog: You want to drink again tonight? Sandra (still on the dressing) Just so you know.
47) 24) dialog: I have weed. Sandra opens a pizza box on the counter. She drizzles a liberal quantity of ranch dressing onto the pizza.
48) 2) dialog: Come in. (CONTINUED)
48) 5) dialog: My sister Sandra. This is her place.
48) 13) dialog: We’re going to my room. INT. MATT’S HOUSE (bedroom) - night If the dynamic between Matt and Sandra seemed stunted, Matt’s bedroom is even worse. It looks exactly the way it might have when he was in high school. A twin bed. A record collection. It’s an awkward moment.
48) 14) dialog: This is my room. (CONTINUED)
48) 18) dialog: Other way around. (by way of explanation) Independent living isn’t so easy for me. He limps over to an iPod dock.
48) 20) dialog: She orders Hungry Howie's.
48) 22) dialog: Slade made you a mix tape? Maybe he is going to cheat. Mavis sits on Matt’s bed, miserable.
48) 24) dialog: When?
48) 26) dialog: (sarcastically) So you party?
48) 31) dialog: Your nose looks really different.
48) 33) dialog: It’s visible. Mavis looks at Matt with pity.
48) 35) dialog: No, no. You should stay. There’s no good “mom n’ pop” video here anyway. Mavis sits up, interested.
48) 37) dialog: The former site of Crocodile Rock Video is now, I believe, a one- hour dry cleaner’s. The guy who owned it--
48) 39) dialog: Yes, he and his wife moved to the Twin Cities. And they took all the inventory. VHS, Beta, all the laser discs-- I know because I tried to buy some of it. (CONTINUED)
48) 43) dialog: Victor.
48) 45) dialog: (knowing) You were used to getting your way. Mavis’s laugh is brittle.
48) 47) dialog: That guy, Victor, he’s dead now. He cannonballed off the Lowry Avenue Bridge.
48) 49) dialog: Yes. It’s all horrible Disney Vault kiddie bullshit. They don’t even have a “back room.” (CONTINUED)
48) 53) dialog: Well, what do you watch when you want to get off? Mavis wouldn’t normally answer such a question-- particularly from someone like Matt-- but for some reason, she does.
49) 0) text: MUSIC UP: Something dreamy, noisy, guitar-driven, slow. Mavis and Matt walk into the huge supermarket in slow motion. Their eyes are red. Matt wears the kind of trench coat favored by unpopular teenage boys. They walk up to a FREEZER CASE, a veritable wall of brightly packaged junk. So many choices. Mavis opens the transparent freezer door. White vapor drifts out onto her face, tickling her closed eyes. Matt picks a box of Swanson’s chicken nuggets and a Celeste Pizza for One. Mavis finally decides on a Lean Cuisine. She slides it under her arm and they head down the aisle to a checkout lane.
50) 0) text: A quiet lamplit street lined with trees and clean sidewalks. Crickets chirp. Mavis drives slowly, peering out the window. Matt is in the passenger seat. His voice is stoner-hoarse.
50) 1) dialog: I think this is it. Mavis is chewing blue Bubble Yum. Stoner gum.
50) 5) dialog: This is definitely his house. He drives a Jeep Liberty.
50) 7) dialog: You're so fucked up. Mavis looks out at Buddy’s house in the darkness. It’s small, ordinary. But something about the single light emanating from the kitchen feels like home. Mavis is sad. Her voice becomes quiet and dreamy.
50) 9) dialog: Yeah.
50) 11) dialog: Maybe. Maybe someone’s up with uh, that baby. Mavis blows a blue bubble with her gum, surveilling the house.
50) 13) dialog: The problem that has no name.
50) 15) dialog: Everyone here goes to bed at 9. Your hipster food on wheels would go largely uneaten.
50) 19) dialog: (reminding her) It’s all you.
57) 3) dialog: water?
57) 6) dialog: You need to ease up. Okay? You’re drinking every night. Your liver must look like like a State Fair pickle. Mavis has a wet, unlit cigarette between her lips.
57) 8) dialog: (mocking) Ooh, cool. Punk rock. Taxi Driver. Why are you on a bender, Mavis?
57) 12) dialog: So? That’s like 70% of the population. Maybe more. Why don’t you exercise or something? Take your fucking dog for a walk for once.
57) 14) dialog: Oh, fuck! Me! Fuuuuck!
57) 16) dialog: I hate this guy over here. Matt nods toward a MAN in a WHEELCHAIR. The man is drinking a beer and laughing with a group of friends.
57) 18) dialog: Mike Moran is your cousin?
57) 20) dialog: That’s your cousin over there, whom you’re ignoring?
57) 22) dialog: My cousins all live in Germany. MIKE has spotted them and is wheeling over with a broad grin on his face.
57) 23) dialog: Here comes the happiest cripple in Minnesota.
57) 31) dialog: Hot lead? Mike It’s candy. Hee! Anyway, the kids are great. Work is a trip, but I play hard, too. I’ve been doing a lot of rock-climbing. Matt is incredulous.
57) 32) dialog: What, like, rock-crawling, you mean?
57) 35) dialog: No. (CONTINUED)
57) 40) dialog: No, it isn’t.
57) 42) dialog: When did he get that chair? When we were freshmen?
57) 45) dialog: You’re a piece of work.
61) 40) dialog: I understand. Mavis stands there on the sidewalk, emotionally exhausted. Matt smiles, naturally intuiting her pain. Mavis smiles back, weary.
61) 42) dialog: You holding? (CONTINUED)
61) 46) dialog: I got some. Matt reaches for his crutch and moves gingerly down the hill toward Mavis.
62) 0) text: Mercury High is lit up like a brick prison. Past the football and soccer fields, there’s a small wooded area. Mavis and Matt trek through the overgrowth. Mavis shivers in her tank top. She reaches into her purse and takes out the RED SWEATSHIRT she found at her parent’s house. She pulls it on. It’s a traditional high school P.E. shirt. On the front label, there’s a large surname written in Magic Marker: SLADE. Buddy glances at the shirt but doesn’t say anything.
62) 2) dialog: It used to be a rubber fabrication plant in the ‘20s.
62) 5) dialog: (interrupting) I didn’t know you were a slut.
62) 9) dialog: I haven’t been to this place since then. Mavis rests comfortably against a tree, still indulging in high school sex memories.
62) 11) dialog: This is where I got hurt. Mavis doesn’t know what to say.
62) 13) dialog: No you didn’t.
62) 15) dialog: No, it’s okay. (beat) Looks different here anyway. I think they cleared away a lot of it when they built that new science building.
62) 17) dialog: You want all the dirt, huh?
62) 22) dialog: I don’t really think about it much anymore, Mavis. I’m a pretty positive guy. Not everyone wallows in pain like you do. You practically jerk off to your life’s worst moments. Mavis flinches as if physically injured.
62) 24) dialog: The heartbreak of split-ends?
62) 26) dialog: I might as well catch up. You’ve had a 20-year head start.
62) 28) dialog: You’re not involved with him! Jesus! It’s sad!
62) 32) dialog: He didn’t make out with you. I bet my oma kisses me harder than that at Christmas.
62) 34) dialog: Yes, I noticed. And FYI, you look completely insane wearing it. Look, I don’t know what he’s doing with you, or what you think he’s doing with you, but I do know that whatever it is, it’s not cool, and it’s your fault. And you're shitty for wanting it. Also, and I just want to get this out in the open, Buddy Slade is a moron.
62) 36) dialog: You don’t know anything about what happened to me! Those jocks you used to put out for-- they shattered my legs, they bashed in my skull, they mangled my junk so I have to piss and cum sideways for the rest of my life, and they left me for dead. Things aren’t so great “down south.” I can barely have fuck myself, let alone another person.
62) 39) dialog: This, coming from someone who's still trying to get a retake on her senior photo. (beat) Stop seeing Buddy. With his wife, without his wife, doesn’t matter. Stop seeing him in your mind. Just stop. It’s wrong.
62) 41) dialog: Getting a guy hot for you is not some blue ribbon accomplishment. Big deal. You’re pretty. And skinny. And frankly, it’s not real unusual for a bored middle aged guy to be flirt with a blonde bitch. You’re a generic fantasy. You’re just a frame in the highlight reel. Mavis’s voice is quieter than usual.
62) 43) dialog: You’re not his soul mate. Beth is. 84. Mavis is walking toward the street. She turns to him with a false not of compassion in her voice.
62) 45) dialog: Right, no one would care about my broken body. Sure, people see past that shit every day. Hey, why don’t you use my crutch as a metaphor again? That was really masterful. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
62) 48) dialog: You should put that in one of your little teenage stories. God knows you don’t know anything about being an adult.
62) 50) dialog: Because you're crazy? You haven’t changed at all. I bet you still have an “ugly best friend” who makes you feel better about yourself. Right? (calling after her) I bet you still flirt with any man who will give you the validation you so desperately crave. Mavis walks away, huddled in her sweatshirt. She refuses to show emotion. Matt leans against a tree, tired from standing, and watches her disappear. INT. “KENTACOHUT” - THE NEXT DAY
63) 0) text: Mavis enters the big, chain video store Matt urged her to avoid. The light is fluorescent, sickly. She faces a massive wall of DVDs, surrounded by bright promotional placards and stuffed toys. All 50 DVDs are identical. A sign reads “WE HAVE IT IN STOCK-- GUARANTEED!”
69) 0) text: The doorbell chimes. Matt limps to the door. Sandra watches America’s Funniest Home Videos in the background. Matt opens the door to reveal Mavis, weeping hysterically. Her dress is covered in punch, and she’s practically incoherent.
69) 4) dialog: Don’t do that! Sandra is watching, dumbstruck, from her beanbag chair. She’s horrified by the sight of her idol/nemesis ripping at that perfect blonde hair.
69) 6) dialog: I got it, Sandra. He grabs Mavis by her arms and guides her to his room as she sobs violently. Mavis throws herself on Matt. He loses his balance and falls onto the bed.
69) 7) dialog: You’re scaring me. Mavis weeps, sniffling into Matt’s T-shirt.
69) 9) dialog: You're very lovable.
69) 11) dialog: Guys like me are born automatically loving women like you. We spend the rest of our lives in reverse, trying to make it stop.
69) 13) dialog: What happened? (CONTINUED)
69) 16) dialog: What happened?
69) 18) dialog: Let me get you a shirt... Mavis kneels there, staring at him, not trying to cover herself up. She sniffles.
69) 20) dialog: I don’t know if athletic grey is your color. Mavis looks at him, shirtless and helpless. Shaking, Matt removes his shirt and hands it to Mavis. Mavis holds the shirt against her body for a moment, then lays it aside. Matt is not the type of guy who feels comfortable without a shirt. His arms are crossed.
69) 25) dialog: Beth’s band is terrible. Mavis shrinks at the mention of Beth.
69) 27) dialog: You heard me. Ter-ee-blay. Mavis ponders this quietly. Then.
69) 29) dialog: I suppose it’s admirable to make time for art. But from a technical perspective, they’re absolutely wretched. A moment of silence. Then, Matt leans in, as if telling Mavis an important secret.
69) 30) dialog: I would even say they’re the worst band I’ve ever seen.
69) 32) dialog: Well. You know I work at Champion’s so I see a lot of really bad local acts come through. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
69) 35) dialog: Like a Blues Traveler cover band, except they guy couldn’t play the harmonica. So they had a kazoo. (chuckling) And you know, lots of teenagers who can’t even tune their instruments properly. Hairy chicks who can’t sing. All kinds of untalented people. But Beth's band, they’re the musical nadir. The worst. For sure.
69) 37) dialog: I think she has an E.D. She came in once and ordered three buffalo wings, and asked me how many points they were.
69) 39) dialog: Anyway, I just wanted you to know.
69) 41) dialog: Why Buddy? Mavis’s responds in a sleepy whisper.
69) 43) dialog: Are other guys unkind? Mavis’s voice breaks.
69) 48) dialog: You weren’t your best then, Mavis. I saw you every day. You had this little mirror in your locker. It was shaped like a heart, and you looked at that mirror more than you ever looked at me. And I was at my best. Mavis reaches over and puts her hand on Matt’s face. She looks at him for a long time, widening her eyes exaggeratedly. Staring. They’re nose to nose. Mavis sniffles, but Matt doesn’t pull away.
