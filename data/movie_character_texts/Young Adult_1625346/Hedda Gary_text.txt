59) 8) dialog: This isn’t a large town. You must have known we were bound to run into each other.
59) 10) dialog: You never come home, and when you do, you hide from me and your dad. Curious behavior.
59) 12) dialog: I said “dad.” We’ve been over the difference. Oh, did you see we got a cupcake bakery?
59) 14) dialog: It's pretty good, at least for around here. Mercury is not known for its pattisseries.
59) 16) dialog: Where are you staying, baby?
59) 20) dialog: (dubious) Do teenagers play at the park?
59) 22) dialog: Seven?
59) 24) dialog: Ah.
59) 26) dialog: It’s just for a little bit. Don’t argue with me while I’m driving. I still get very nervous. INT. HEDDA AND DAVID’S HOUSE - DAY Mavis walks into her childhood home, already crushed by the psychic weight of the exercise. Hedda is carrying Baguette.
59) 27) dialog: (shouting) David! Mavis is here, of all people! Mavis’s stepfather, DAVID, emerges from the back of the house. There’s something wild-eyed and unsettling about him.
59) 33) dialog: The Mavey & Davey Show is back on the air.
59) 37) dialog: (to David) Her hair looks incredible.
59) 40) dialog: Always, since she was little it’s had that sweet smell. Except when you got skunked, Mavis!
59) 44) dialog: (to Mavis) Boy, you were a real beast that day.
59) 46) dialog: Let me see what we have in the kitchen. There’s some white wine...
59) 49) dialog: I’m painting the sun porch.
59) 51) dialog: It’s important for women my age to do weight-bearing exercise.

59) 59) dialog: You must be jealous as hell. Davis chuckles.
59) 61) dialog: You can’t hide from us, Pee Pee. We’re you’re permanent best friends.
59) 64) dialog: Oh, it doesn’t work that way!
59) 66) dialog: You wish your kids were a part of you. But they never are. Never. They’re more like little parasitic worms. They cling to you and then they inherit the worst of you.
59) 68) dialog: I think Buddy will be a very good father. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
59) 71) dialog: He always took care of you when you were melting down. Which was-- always! She laughs.
59) 75) dialog: See if you like my new reed diffuser. INT. HEDDA AND DAVID’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - DAY Mavis creeps upstairs and peeks into her old bedroom. It’s the bedroom of a popular girl from the ‘90s-- which seems pretty sad and faded now. Her bulletin board, covered in blue ribbons and certificates, still hangs over the desk. There’s a diploma from the University of Minnesota, and some Kappa Alpha Theta stuff. We see a framed class photo of Mavis with HUGE BANGS sitting in the corner. Teenage Mavis has a smile so huge it’s almost a grimace. There’s a class graduation photo on the wall, one of those giant long-format ones with everyone’s head shot. Mavis walks over to it and scans the names. No sign of Matt. In small type at the bottom of the picture it says: Photos not available: Yun Ng, Matthew Freehauf. Mavis opens the closet. From a pile of old clothes, she retrieves a RED SWEATSHIRT and unfolds it eagerly. We can’t see what’s on the front of it.
61) 2) dialog: What?
61) 4) dialog: Just because you got a divorce doesn’t mean that we can’t enjoy the memory of Allen.
61) 6) dialog: Have you talked to that little nephew of his lately? Perseus or Sophocles or...
61) 8) dialog: Because you were close and it would be a nice thing to do. Mavis says nothing. HEDDA (CONT’D) You shouldn’t have married him if you didn’t want to form lasting relationships. (beart)
61) 13) dialog: Now what is this? Are we doing this again? Mavis jerks away. David walks in with a basket of small tan eggs.
61) 15) dialog: Omelettes and a nice, fresh green salad. She smiles, pleased with herself.
61) 17) dialog: (proudly) Plugra. I got this at Anderley’s. This is the best butter there is. The absolute best.
61) 19) dialog: They use this on the Food Network. David reaches out and cracks the first of the eggs into the skillet. What comes out is definitely NOT OKAY. It’s a bloody mess. (CONTINUED)
61) 22) dialog: Uh-oh!
61) 29) dialog: This is where you’re staying?
61) 33) dialog: Well, that’s different. Mavis gathers her purse and gives her mother a perfunctory kiss on the cheek.
61) 34) dialog: I suppose this neighborhood is getting very young.
61) 36) dialog: Go ahead, lie to me. She offers Mavis her cheek for a kiss. Mavis obliges.
61) 37) dialog: (fondly) Peepers. Be well. Mavis gets out of the car. Hedda drives away. Matt stubs out his cigarette.
