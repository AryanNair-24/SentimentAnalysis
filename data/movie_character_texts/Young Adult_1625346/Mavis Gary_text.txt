1) 0) text: The ringing continues, growing more shrill. Reveal a black old-fashioned alarm clock from Restoration Hardware. There’s a half-empty wine glass next to the clock. MAVIS GARY stirs in bed. She’s mid-thirties, blonde, attractive. Though Mavis is clearly an adult, we recognize her as the student from the dream. Mavis smacks the clock with surprising violence, and goes back to sleep. The alarm bell rings again, brutal. Mavis gets up and walks into the bathroom. She’s not * wearing any pants or underwear.
2) 0) text: Mavis, now wearing unflattering pajama pants, enters the kitchen. We see an empty whiskey bottle on the kitchen counter, and a few empty wine bottles. (CONTINUED)
2) 2) dialog: Good morning, Baguette. Baguette jumps, excited. Mavis peels back the foil ona single-serving container of dog food and places it on the floor. She walks away, not particularly invested in the dog's breakfast.
3) 0) text: Alone, Mavis swats at the air. She jumps. She gyrates her hips. She looks silly. Reveal she’s playing Wii Fit. A BALCONY is visible through a sliding glass door. Baguette is locked outside. He stands on his hind legs, wildly batting at the glass.
4) 0) text: Mavis sits on the small steel-girdered balcony in her pajamas. She drinks a can of diet soda. Now Baquette is trapped inside, batting wildly at the other side of the glass. From Mavis’s perch, we see downtown Minneapolis, the Mississippi River, and other converted loft buildings that used to be factories and granaries.
5) 0) text: Mavis sits at her computer. Near the monitor, we see a stack of books, They’re all titled Waverley Prep and numbered as if in a series. We see #4, #27, #128. There’s also a large office binder that says WAVERLEY PREP SERIES BIBLE. Mavis starts up her computer and opens a text document called pieceofshit.word. It’s a work in progress; Mavis appears to be on page 17. The last sentence Mavis has written reads as follows: “Ashby was the undisputed king bee of Waverley Prep.” Mavis stares at the document without enthusiasm. (CONTINUED)
5) 1) text: She opens her Web browser and goes directly to a celebrity gossip website. She scrolls down the page, pausing over each item, staring at the vacant, grinning faces of famous people. She opens another window-- her email. She deletes all the overnight spam. We see a message that reads RE:RE:RE:END OF SERIES. Mavis notices the message, perhaps grimacing a little, but doesn’t open it. She then notices a NEW MESSAGE. The subject line says: “The best thing that ever happened to us” Mavis pauses, then opens the email. We see a large photo of a NEWBORN BABY in a knitted cap that looks like a strawberry. There’s a small block of text beneath. Mavis’s expression is neutral as she reads the message. She closes the window. After a moment, she clicks it open again, re-reading. And re-reading. She reaches for a strand of hair near her ear and begins yanking it in a distracted, obsessive-compulsive way.
6) 0) text: It could be ten minutes later. It could be an hour later. Mavis is still in her apartment and still pajama-clad, but now she’s on the phone. She paces, holding her dog as if it’s an object.
6) 1) dialog: (on the phone) Are you busy? Okay. No. Well, I just have one quick thing to tell you. I got, like, a birth announcement. From Buddy. (impatient) Yes, Buddy Slade. Well, Beth actually sent it. (beat) Beth, the wife? She must have done like, a “send all” or something. Like a mass email to everyone in his address book, whether they’re living or dead or even remotely relevant to the situation? One of those. I haven't talked to him in, God, four years? (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
6) 3) dialog: And I’ve only met her once, like at Moon’s thing, so why would I be included on this list? You know? It's like, think. Like, send those things to your actual friends, you know? Jesus. (beat) I guess. The baby looks like just a red...you know how they look. It looks like a fetus from Life Magazine. Yeah, I don’t know. It has a strawberry hat. (beat) Um, a girl, I think? Yeah, a girl. Well, I didn’t see how tall it was or how long or whatever, but it says eight pounds and some ounces. You know, they measure babies in ounces. Like marijuana. (defeated) Yes, that’s all! What, is that not interesting enough for you? All right, no, just kidding. Well, have fun at work. (beat) ‘Bye. Mavis hangs up. Then redials.
6) 4) dialog: Me again. Hi. Are you gonna have lunch today?
7) 0) text: Mavis and her friend VICKI eat McDonald's in a depressing courtyard behind a Wells Fargo building. VICKI is upholstered in a cheap business suit from the mall. Mavis is sloppily dressed. Vicki gives her the once-over.
7) 2) dialog: (dejected) Yeah. Lucky. See if you like always writing the same crap about the same five teenagers and their amazing wardrobes. (CONTINUED)
7) 5) dialog: Yeah.
7) 7) dialog: (bristling) Books don’t get “canceled”, Vicki. That’s not the terminology.
7) 9) dialog: This birth announcement thing. Buddy... Vicki won’t let Mavis derail her anecdote.
7) 11) dialog: I don’t understand why they would send me something like that.
7) 13) dialog: Listen!
7) 15) dialog: Yeah. The baby was just born like a month ago. I mean, when you send something that soon, isn’t it just for the inner circle?
7) 18) dialog: Not for the ex-girlfriend of the father, who doesn’t even talk to him anymore.
7) 20) dialog: My cousin?
7) 22) dialog: I have a real date tonight. With Peter.
7) 24) dialog: (flat) I am excited. Vicki’s laugh is a disrespectful honk.
7) 26) dialog: I’m not. I just wanted to tell you about something that happened. God, excuse me.
7) 28) dialog: By choice. (CONTINUED)
7) 31) dialog: Yeah. Vicki points with a french fry, her mouth full.
8) 0) text: Mavis returns from her lunch with VICKI. She greets Baguette, who jumps at her knees.
8) 1) dialog: Hi, Baguette. She slides the door to the balcony open. Baguette runs onto the tiny balcony. There’s a small patch of Astroturf with a plastic fire hydrant. This functions as Baguette’s bathroom.
8) 2) dialog: Hurry up. Hurry up. (praising) Good hurry up. Mavis grabs a banana from the kitchen counter. As she peels it, she heads back to her office.
9) 0) text: Mavis contemplates her computer. Unable to resist, she opens the birth announcement email again. She hits PRINT.
10) 0) text: Mavis is kneeling in front of the printer. She rips an INK CARTRIDGE out of the bowels of the printer and shakes it in frustration.
10) 1) dialog: (to herself) Fuck you. Goddamit. She locates a hole in the cartridge and SPITS in it.
10) 2) text: Mavis sits on the balcony, eating her banana and reading the birth announcement. Bands of strange ink colors run across the baby’s face, making it look alternately pink, blue, and yellow.
11) 0) text: A romantic Warehouse District “gastropub”, all exposed brick and oil lamps. This is the kind of place that has quail on the menu and an organic wine list. Mavis walks in, dressed for a date. She has legs for miles, but she tugs uncomfortably on the hem of her minidress. She squints, looking for someone. A guy wearing a suit waves her over to his table. This is PETER, 42, average looks, moderate hair. Mavis heads over to the table.
11) 2) dialog: Hi.
11) 4) dialog: Thank God! She seems to realize how inane her response is immediately.
11) 6) dialog: (lying) Crazy. So busy. Just a ton of stress. (CONTINUED)
11) 9) dialog: It’s pretty nutso. (to waitress) Sparkling water? Not flat, please-- you guys always bring me flat. Anyway. I’m just very busy these days. Working, working, working. Agghh! The waitress disappears.
11) 11) dialog: Young adult, yeah. “Y.A.” That’s what we call it in the publishing biz. There are other acronyms, too. Peter drinks his beer and clinks Mavis’s glass.
11) 13) dialog: Ha ha. That’s me, all right.
11) 15) dialog: Mmhm.
11) 21) dialog: That must just annoy you so much. The appetizer has arrived, stealing Peter’s attention. He heaps his plate with oysters, shaking Tabasco onto their slimy innards. He slurps an oyster with gusto.
12) 0) text: It’s a gray, quiet morning. Mavis opens her eyes. Peter is in bed next to her, his hand splayed across her back to reveal his signature Rolex Submariner. Mavis looks at him. She lifts his arm as if he’s a Mannequin and climbs out of bed. She crosses the room, wearing Peter’s undershirt and a “date night” thong. Mavis opens her too-small closet and pulls out a gigantic suitcase. She unzips it and places it on the bed. She begins folding clothes and placing them in the suitcase. Mavis packs neatly and judiciously, holding up outfits before they make the final cut. Peter sleeps on, oblivious.
13) 0) text: Mavis, now fully dressed, struggles to get Baguette into a small dog carrier. Finally, she zips up the sides. The carrier wriggles. Mavis throws a few cans of dog food into a large pink Victoria’s Secret shopping bag.
14) 0) text: Mavis places a SPARE KEY next to Peter’s sleeping face on the pillow. 11.
15) 0) text: With the suitcase, the bag, and the dog in tow, Mavis exits, as casually as if she were going to the store.
16) 0) text: Mavis enters an underground parking garage packed with Jettas, Priuses, and other neglected midprice hipstermobiles. She lugs her suitcase, the shopping bag, and Baguette’s carrier. Her MINI Cooper is blocked in by a grid of cars. She tries to squeeze her body through to access the drivers seat, then realizes there’s really no point to that exercise. The car is stuck.
17) 0) text: Time has passed. Mavis waits in the vicinity of her car, surrounded by her things. A PARKING ATTENDANT appears, a calloused, slow-moving older man.
17) 2) dialog: (red-faced) Yes. I’m blocked in.
17) 4) dialog: I know. It’s sort of an emergency. It’s a family emergency thing. My father. My father’s dying. The attendant climbs into one of the cars behind Mavis’s MINI and starts the ignition. We can tell by his demeanor that this is going to take a while.
17) 5) dialog: (insincere) I know, I’m the worst. Thank you so, so much. 12.
18) 0) text: The car exits the garage. Mavis is behind the wheel. Baguette is now sitting in her lap, panting eagerly.
19) 0) text: Mavis drives through downtown Minneapolis, passing strip clubs and convention centers. She pauses to gawk at a huge sex shop. Orange neon winks at her from the window.
20) 0) text: Mavis’s car drives down a rural stretch of highway. Factory farms and ruined fields as far as the eye can see. Mavis takes the exit north, toward DULUTH. INT. CAR —- DAY Mavis listens to Britney Spears and rolls down the window. A surprisingly strong blast of wind hits her face, messing her hair. She rolls the window up again. Baguette gnaws on Pemmican beef jerky on the passenger seat. The wrapper is visible on the floor.
21) 0) text: Mavis pumps gas at a truck stop. A tweaked-out LOT LIZARD in full hooker regalia approaches her.
21) 2) dialog: No.
21) 4) dialog: Have you tried breastfeeding? (CONTINUED)
21) 7) dialog: My sister’s a lactation coach. Her voice trails off as the woman moves closer. Mavis is unnecessarily firm.
21) 8) dialog: I don’t have anything for you. I’m sorry. The gas pump hiccups to a stop. Mavis withdraws the nozzle and sprays her hand with gasoline. The hooker walks away, mumbling.
21) 10) dialog: Did you just call me a yankee? We’re in Minnesota. Northern Minnesota.
22) 0) text: Mavis’s car is pulled over to the shoulder of the road. She paces in the gravel while Baguette finds a spot to pee. Baguette pees. Mavis JOGS and LEAPS in place, doing some of her Wii Fit moves even though she’s outside. In the distance, we see the shores of Lake Superior.
23) 0) text: Mavis is parked, fumbling through crap in her backseat. She flips through an CD booklet until she finds a CD that says “Mad love, Buddy” in black Sharpie. She pops in the CD. A ‘90s alterna-pop song fills the car. It’s “THE CONCEPT” by Teenage Fanclub. Mavis mouths the words and pulls out a ONE-HITTER. She’s already tamped some pot down into the bowl. (CONTINUED)
23) 3) dialog: She wears denim wherever she goes. She’s gonna buy a record from the Status Quo, oh yeah.. Mavis lights up contentedly, exhaling as the song crescendos.
24) 0) text: It’s a typically sad long-term lodging establishment. Mavis parks her car and walks toward the main entrance. She carries Baguette in a bag.
25) 2) dialog: I would like to check in. FRONT DESK Girl Do you have a reservation? Mavis is mildly annoyed by this basic question.
25) 3) dialog: No. The girl recites her spiel as if she’s just learned it.
25) 5) dialog: I don’t know. Maybe just a week or something. It’s a business trip. I’m a lawyer. A patent attorney. (beat) Torts. (CONTINUED)
25) 9) dialog: Nope. Diabetes testing supplies. She’s surprised by her own lie.
25) 11) dialog: In fact, I do have a dog, but he’s in my vehicle. The bag WRIGGLES wildly, betraying Mavis instantly.
25) 13) dialog: Two, please. She leans over as the girl makes the keys, as if to supervise. The girl rolls her eyes almost imperceptibly.
25) 14) dialog: Two...there we go.
26) 0) text: Baguette scampers around on the bed. Mavis looks at the clock, then looks at her phone. She sits down on the bed and dials.
26) 1) dialog: (loudly, into phone) Personal. Mercury, Minnesota. Mercury, Minnesota. Slade. (CONTINUED)
27) 0) text: Mavis darts across the pedestrian-unfriendly highway. The only structure we can see is a gas station/convenience store, starkly illuminated in the darkness.

30) 0) text: Mavis puts down her ice cream and picks up her cell phone again.

31) 1) dialog: Hi Buddy. I see this is still your number. This is Mavis. You know, Mavis Gary. Um, what’s up? Ha. How are you? I’m just in town taking care of a real estate thing. I thought we could get together for a drink and catch up. Okay. Call me if you’re up for it. ‘Bye. (CONTINUED)
32) 0) text: Mavis enters the lobby once again, her pace brisk and businesslike. The zit she tried to pop is now an angry red blotch. The front desk girl is gone. Mavis notices this with some relief.
33) 0) text: MUSIC UP: Buddy’s MIX TAPE Mavis is back in her car, driving into town. She passes a sign that says: MERCURY CITY LIMITS. As she enters Mercury proper, we can see that it’s a fairly charming place. Suburban houses, a classic Main Street, Mercury Senior High School. (Mavis slows to peek at the latter.) It’s literally a drive down Memory Lane. Only Memory Lane has changed a little.
33) 1) dialog: (to herself) They have a Starbucks now. We see a brand new KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN/TACO BELL/PIZZA HUT HYBRID.
33) 2) dialog: And a KenTacoHut? She drives on toward a roadside bar.
34) 0) text: The Blue Hill is a shitty standalone dive bar. Mavis pauses on the road, looking at the blinking neon sign and the tired cars in the gravel lot. She pulls in anyway. (CONTINUED)
34) 3) dialog: (on phone) Hey you. Her voice is soft and relieved.
35) 0) text: Mavis walks in, flush with victory. Skynrd plays on the jukebox. The whole scene is tragic. It’s a weeknight. The place is mainly populated with barflies and other sad-looking individuals. Mavis sits down at the bar.
35) 1) dialog: Maker's Mark, please. The BARTENDER obliges. Mavis drinks in such a way that we can tell she’s an experienced and enthusiastic drinker. Mavis looks around the bar. MATT FREEHAUF, 36, is watching her from an adjacent barstool. He’s sad-faced and overweight. There’s a STEEL CRUTCH, the permanent kind, leaning against his stool. Mavis glances at him. She looks away and takes a pink compact mirror out of her purse. She opens the mirror and checks herself out. She glances over at Matt again. He’s still staring.
35) 3) dialog: At the same time?
35) 5) dialog: Mavis Gary-Crane now.
35) 9) dialog: Well, I got divorced.
35) 11) dialog: So it’s just back to Gary, I guess. Has been for a while. I’m sorry, what is your name?
35) 13) dialog: Ohhhh! Her eyes wander to the CRUTCH propped against his stool.
35) 14) dialog: Of course. Matt Freehauf. Matt. Your locker was right there, by mine. (grasping) On the second floor of the school? Yeah.
35) 16) dialog: Right, right.
35) 20) dialog: I do recall that.
35) 22) dialog: How’s your dick?
35) 25) dialog: So you were gay.
35) 27) dialog: Well, it’s nice to see you. Mavis taps away at her cell phone idly. Matt’s not ready to end the conversation.
35) 29) dialog: Oh. I’m just taking care of this real estate thing. I have some property, so. The lie makes her uncomfortable every time. (CONTINUED)
35) 33) dialog: Talent?
35) 35) dialog: My uncle runs the publishing house. A surprised half-smile from Matt, who appreciates straight talk. Mavis downs the rest of her drink as they relax into drunken conversation. MUSIC UP as TIME PASSES.
36) 0) text: Mavis is obviously drunk. Her body language is sloppy and she shouts over the music. She leans toward Matt conspiratorially.
36) 1) dialog: I love Taylor Swift! She reaches for a BOTTLE of an unfamiliar beverage, which Matt eyes with some alarm. He steadies her arm before she can spill it.
36) 3) dialog: Hard Jack. See? This is what Buddy Slade drinks! She takes a passionate swig. MATT is confused. (CONTINUED)
36) 7) dialog: My family? Fuck my family!
36) 9) dialog: I don’t have a “good” relationship with my stepfather, right? She makes air quotes around the word good for no reason.
36) 10) dialog: When I got married to Allen...Allen is my ex-husband, Allen Crane, the retard of Hennepin County, but anyway. When I got married to Allen, me and my stepfather go out to do our special daddy-daughter dance at the reception. Right? Because he basically raised me, inasmuch as...whatever. And I tell you, my stepfather has always been weird. Around me, and well, just around me. So we go out and this song starts playing, you know (singing) I got sunshiiiine...
36) 12) dialog: And we're dancing at my wedding in a whole circle of people, and I suddenly notice that my stepfather...has...an erection. Matt reels.
36) 16) dialog: Dark indeed. “That’s dark.” I love how you said that. You’re hilarious. She paws Matt’s arm affectionately.
36) 18) dialog: Wanna know why I’m really in town?
36) 20) dialog: (stage-whispering) I can’t tell you here, man.
37) 0) text: Mavis and MATT stand in the parking lot near the kitchen entrance. Mavis is SMOKING aggressively. As Matt moves further from the entrance, we can see how much effort it takes for him to walk, even with assistance. MATT leans on his crutch, waiting for Mavis to speak.
37) 1) dialog: I’m here because I’m still deeply in love with Buddy Slade and I want him back. MATT laughs, assuming this is a joke.
37) 5) dialog: ‘id's ear. (exhales ) The kid’s here. She had the baby. I don’t care though. I have baggage, too.
37) 7) dialog: I know people won’t understand, but things like this happen. They do happen. Usually they happen in slow-motion. Like, two people are meant to be together and then they slowly get rid of what’s keeping them apart. They get divorced, they reconfigure. And everyone’s cool with that, right? Society’s okay with that. (rambling) Everyone’s a homewrecker; we just wreck very slowly. Matt can barely follow her drunken rant.
37) 8) dialog: But see, I can’t go slow. I have to tell Buddy now. I don’t have time to play this little game of decency that everyone is so into. (breaking up) You see, Freehauf? I’m 36. I don’t have time. Matt is momentarily speechless. Mavis focuses her attention on trying to light the wrong end of another cigarette.
37) 10) dialog: Hey, my friend Kelly is a therapist! My friend Kelly, she’s a therapist at Kaiser Permanente and-- (CONTINUED)
37) 14) dialog: Well, I already did. I called him, and he called me back. We’re meeting up tomorrow night. She notices a CAB has pulled up and is idling on the curb.
37) 15) dialog: Oh. A cab for me.
37) 17) dialog: A life? Babies are boring, okay? Buddy’s life is BORING. Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring! She climbs into the cab as MATT watches, incredulous.
37) 18) dialog: (hanging out the window)
38) 0) text: Mavis wakes up, still wearing her clothes from the night before. Her dog is in bed with her. She sits up, her hair plastered across her face. She looks across the room and sees vomit on the floor; it appears that she’d tried to clean it up with a MOTEL towel the night before. (CONTINUED)

40) 0) text: Mavis finally arrives at her destination on foot. Her car is alone in the lot. There’s a letter on her windshield: "Do'nt (sic) Park Here Alnight CITY BOY.” She crumples it up, gets in and drives away.
41) 0) text: Mavis sits in a high-tech “throne.” Her feet are ina swirling basin of water. The chair vibrates. A young GIRL on her knees buffs Mavis’s feet. She reaches for a pedicure tool.

45) 1) dialog: (to herself) Champion O’Malley’s... She spots it and pulls over, gripping the steering wheel. INT. CHAMPION O’MALLEY’S —- HAPPY HOUR Champion’s is a slick new SPORTS BAR, flooded with natural light and much more cheerful than the Blue Hill. Mavis is sitting in a polished wood booth. She positions herself so she has a clear view of the door. She cranes her neck ever so slightly. A passing BAR EMPLOYEE plunks down some silverware rolled in a napkin. Mavis recoils tensely.
45) 2) dialog: Oh! No, no! I don’t need silverware! Her voice is a bit too loud. (CONTINUED)
45) 5) dialog: No. Thanks. I wouldn’t mind two Hard Jack ciders, though.
45) 7) dialog: Hey you!
45) 9) dialog: I know. I was just back in town, taking care of some real estate stuff and I thought... She shrugs.
45) 13) dialog: How are things in “Jerkury?” Buddy squints, confused, them remembers the old joke.
45) 15) dialog: (to waitress) Excellent. A couple of Hard Jacks, please!
45) 17) dialog: Oh, me neither, God. But I figured for old times sake.
45) 19) dialog: Of course.

45) 27) dialog: I’m just working my butt off. Doing my thing in the city.
45) 29) dialog: (shrill) Nobody calls it the “Mini Apple,” Buddy, God! She laughs, slapping his hand. He doesn’t recoil, but he doesn’t respond either.
45) 30) dialog: So are you still at General Mills?
45) 32) dialog: Ah. Very chivalrous. Buddy gets up and heads over to the bar. Mavis turns her head in sync with his departing body, staring at him. MUSIC UP: Something dreamy, sexy and worshipful, like “My Sweet Lord” by George Harrison. In slow motion, we see Buddy sidle up to the bar, leaning toward the bartender. Mavis’s gaze-- our gaze-- drifts down his body. Suddenly, Mavis is alive. (CONTINUED)
45) 36) dialog: Freehauf. What are you doing here?
45) 38) dialog: (tightly) Just having a cocktail.
45) 40) dialog: It was good running into you last night. Nice to see you again. She half-waves as if to dismiss him. Buddy appears with the drinks. He doesn’t seem super- tight with MATT, but he’s friendly and familiar.
45) 46) dialog: (to Matt) It's crazy to see you here. I mean, in a good way. Thanks for stopping by.
45) 48) dialog: Ah ha ha ha...

45) 63) dialog: They’re fantastic. I haven't actually stopped by yet, but I definitely will. Yes, I will stop by Oak Lane. I miss them both. A lot.
45) 67) dialog: Allen is well! He’s fine. (beat) We’re not married anymore, but...
45) 69) dialog: No, but we’re great friends. I’ve got his back, and he’s certainly got mine. Buddy is appreciative of this.
45) 71) dialog: (quickly) It does go away. It does and it can. But there’s still a warmth there. A mutual respect. Buddy tries a sip of Hard Jack and grimaces at the taste.
46) 0) text: Mavis walks Buddy to his CAR. It’s obvious it hasn’t been a late night. Mavis is still lucid and Buddy is brisk, businesslike.

46) 6) dialog: Oh my God. (CONTINUED)
46) 10) dialog: (desperately) Buddy.
46) 12) dialog: I want to see you. More. If Buddy catches her meaning, he doesn’t show it.
46) 14) dialog: Weeks, possibly. Or a few days. But I am around, and I just don’t want this to be over. Buddy interprets this as nostalgia. His tone is comforting.
46) 16) dialog: Remember Vicki used to always say you and me were telepathic?
46) 18) dialog: Oh, great. She had a cervical cancer scare, but it turned out to just be HPV. (CONTINUED)
46) 22) dialog: Yes.
46) 24) dialog: My name isn’t actually on the books. I mean, it’s on the title page if you check inside, but I’m basically a ghostwriter.

47) 8) dialog: Yeah. How’d you know?
47) 10) dialog: (flustered) Well, it is me in fact. I just want you to know that what you saw today wasn’t what you think it was.
47) 12) dialog: I was over-served last night.
47) 18) dialog: It’s way more complicated than you could possibly know. Buddy and I have years of history between us, and it’s very rich and complex. And well, you can’t rely on what people say when they've been overserved.
47) 20) dialog: That’s a cliche. Sandra interrupts Matt, brandishing a bottle of KRAFT RANCH DRESSING.

48) 6) dialog: Hi, I’m Mavis.
48) 8) dialog: Right!
48) 11) dialog: That was really nice of you.
48) 17) dialog: Your sister lives with you.
48) 19) dialog: She cooks for you and stuff?
48) 21) dialog: I like Hungry Howie's. MUSIC fills the room. MAVIS (CONT’D) Oh! This is on Buddy’s mix!
48) 23) dialog: He didn’t make it too recently.
48) 25) dialog: The ‘90s. Buddy packs a bowl and offers it to Mavis.
48) 27) dialog: Just pot. When I was away at the U, my first year, I tried acid with some of my Theta sisters. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
48) 30) dialog: I ran into a gate and came this close to fucking up my brand new nose job. That was it for me and hard drugs.
48) 32) dialog: It really doesn’t. They just refined the tip. It’s not visible to anyone who’s not a professional, um, surgeon. Matt takes a huge hit.
48) 34) dialog: I’m not feeling great. Maybe I’m gonna go back to the Homeway Suites and watch a video.
48) 36) dialog: What happened to Crocodile’s?
48) 38) dialog: (interrupting) The fat black-haired guy.
48) 42) dialog: Once when I was 12 I tried to rent that Susanna Hoffs movie, The All Nighter. Susanna Hoffs, you know, she was in the Bangles and I worshipped her. And that fat guy...
48) 44) dialog: That fat guy, he would not let me have it because it was PG-13 and it had “adult situations.” I was so pissed. I made my mom call and bitch them out. Mavis reaches for the bowl and takes a tiny hit.
48) 46) dialog: I never get my way. MATT shrugs, agreeing to disagree. He smokes pot in silence while Mavis braids the shag carpet. Then:
48) 48) dialog: How original. (off Matt’s look) I mean, because that’s like the official suicide bridge. It’s just not a fresh idea, I don’t know. Matt takes another hit, not disagreeing. MAVIS (CONT’D) And now there’s just, what, a regular video place? Like a chain?
48) 52) dialog: I don’t watch that stuff.
48) 54) dialog: High Fidelity.

Matt wears the kind of trench coat favored by unpopular teenage boys. They walk up to a FREEZER CASE, a veritable wall of brightly packaged junk. So many choices. Mavis opens the transparent freezer door. White vapor drifts out onto her face, tickling her closed eyes. Matt picks a box of Swanson’s chicken nuggets and a Celeste Pizza for One. Mavis finally decides on a Lean Cuisine. She slides it under her arm and they head down the aisle to a checkout lane.

50) 2) dialog: You think or you know? (CONTINUED)
50) 6) dialog: That’s ironic. Right? Because he has no freedom. It’s such a ridiculous, overwrought thing to say, but Matt is so stoned he can’t help but giggle.
50) 8) dialog: Do you see that little light in the kitchen?
50) 10) dialog: Do you think someone’s awake?
50) 12) dialog: The baby, the baby.
50) 14) dialog: I wish they had those late-night taco trucks here. Or a Korean truck, even.
50) 16) dialog: Okay. We can go now. (CONTINUED)
50) 20) dialog: Okay. Mavis throws the car into gear and drives off.
52) 0) text: The light outside indicates dawn. The digital clock reads 4:00 AM. Mavis is curled up the bed, fully dressed. Her back is to us. There’s a half-empty glass of BOURBON on the bed table. Mavis rolls over, nearly crushing Baguette. She groans. It’s impossible to tell if it’s a groan of pleasure or annoyance. INT. MOTEL BATHROOM —- MORNING Mavis enters, bleary-eyed. She takes the paper hygiene guard off one of the drinking glasses, fills it with tap water, and takes a long drink. She looks awful. 46.

53) 1) dialog: (singing) Mercury Fashion Square. You can find great fashions there. On 27th and Highway 4... Mavis pulls into a parking spot. (Those who are paying close attention may notice that she’s in designated “STORK PARKING” for expectant and new mothers only. It’s either an act of defiance or obliviousness. )
54) 0) text: Mavis shops in the mall’s flagship department store. It’s not exactly Barney’s New York. Mavis flips through a rack of clothes. A SALES LADY, conservative, forties, approaches her.
54) 2) dialog: Sure. I’ve not having a ton of luck.
54) 4) dialog: No, it’s for a special occasion. Not a formal occasion. Something chic and clean, but also a little bit edgy.
54) 6) dialog: Do you carry Marc Jacobs?
54) 10) dialog: Do you have Imitation of Christ?
54) 12) dialog: I’m going to a rock concert with an old flame, and I think there’s a chance we may reconnect. The sales lady smiles.
54) 14) dialog: He’s seen me recently, so he knows. But this is the first time his wife is seeing me. She doesn’t know what’s compelling her to say these things. But she’s saying them as candidly as if she were in therapy.
54) 16) dialog: Okay.
54) 19) dialog: Hi. Beth rises and takes off her Wayfarers. She’s a pretty woman, still carrying some baby weight around her breasts and middle. She has a kind smile and wears a rock T-shirt with corduroys and Converse.
54) 21) dialog: You too.
54) 23) dialog: Once, at a party a long time ago.
54) 26) dialog: I don’t really drink much alcohol. Maybe just a sparkling water or something. (CONTINUED)
54) 31) dialog: I can see that. The baby roots and latches on to Beth’s breast. Mavis watches, feeling uptight and pristine in her camisole.
54) 32) dialog: My sister is a lactation coach.
54) 34) dialog: She's really cute.
54) 36) dialog: All of it.
54) 38) dialog: No. She didn’t. I can see you in there. A lot of you, in fact. (CONTINUED)
54) 43) dialog: I know, it just seemed funny.
54) 45) dialog: Yeah, I write for a young adult series. It’s extremely popular. Buddy emerges from the house.
54) 48) dialog: That’s pretty fancy.
54) 54) dialog: Thanks. They sit down on a hipster flea market couch.
54) 55) dialog: I like your day-cor, what is this, Regency?
54) 57) dialog: Me and Buddy used to go thrifting all the time. We had a huge stupid T-shirt collection. Just the dumbest things.
54) 59) dialog: Yes, I used to sleep in Buddy's shirts. And boxers.
54) 61) dialog: I still have a few, I think. Buddy looks uncomfortable, but Beth smiles broadly. Mavis sees a strange CHART leaning against the wall. It shows cartoon faces with different expressions. One says “HAPPY,” one says “SAD” and so on.
54) 62) dialog: What’s that chart?
54) 65) dialog: Ahhh!
54) 67) dialog: How about, like, neutral? What if you don’t feel anything?
54) 70) dialog: I feel incredibly free. I can come and go as I please. Nightlife, brunch. I’m never home. Never.
54) 72) dialog: Mm. I do have a dog.
54) 74) dialog: But he’s small, he goes everywhere, with me. Dogs are so easy. You can still have a life, you know? Beth is watching the baby fondly. Her loving expression negates everything Mavis is insinuating. (CONTINUED)
54) 77) dialog: Beth, when did you have this baby?
54) 79) dialog: Well. You’re really getting your figure back. This is the last thing Beth cares about, but she is gracious.
55) 0) text: The baby sleeps in a car seat contraption. Buddy, Mavis and Beth eat burritos from Chipotle. Buddy pats one of the styrofoam take-out containers approvingly.
55) 2) dialog: What happened to Hungry Howie’s? Isn’t that still your favorite?
55) 4) dialog: Well, you are relatively new around here, Beth.
55) 9) dialog: Where are you originally from, anyway? Beth swallows and dabs her mouth with a napkin.
55) 11) dialog: You were rich.
55) 13) dialog: My father’s a doctor too.
55) 15) dialog: (to Buddy) No, my biological father is also in the medical field.
55) 17) dialog: I don’t know, Beth. I’m afraid I haven’t seen him in years.
55) 19) dialog: Sorry for what? She pats Buddy’s arm. MAVIS (CONT’D) Poor Buddy’s over here like Ahhhh! No, it’s all right. I’ve been dealing with it forever. (CONTINUED)
55) 22) dialog: Buddy knows the whole story. He knows everything about me. The whole story of Mavis.
55) 26) dialog: (to Beth) This is all very exciting. Do you need to get dressed for the show?
55) 32) dialog: So are they any good?
55) 34) dialog: Are they good? The band. Buddy seems a little looser than usual. He finishes off the beer.
55) 36) dialog: Ha. God, he’s always just lurking around, isn’t he? So creepy!
55) 38) dialog: Well, he freaks me out. Look at his face. He’s so doughy. He looks like a murderer. It’s a dumb, mean comment but Buddy is amused.
55) 40) dialog: See? Now you’re laughing. (CONTINUED)
56) 0) text: From Mavis’s POV, we head toward a pair of double doors. Just outside the doors, we see a group of gossiping GIRLS wearing high-school uniforms. Only they’re not girls; they’re BETH’S FRIENDS. Mary Ellen glances at Mavis through the glass with a sneer. Mavis pushes through the doors.
56) 9) dialog: Oh, hardly...
56) 13) dialog: (suddenly) I’ll drive him home.
56) 18) dialog: Mary Ellen, you were great tonight. It’s inspiring to see a single, partnerless mother with so much confidence onstage.
56) 21) dialog: Easy, Bud.
56) 23) dialog: What do you mean, “since I knew you”? EXT. BUDDY’S HOUSE (PORCH) - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH) Buddy goes to enter the house, but Mavis stops him.
56) 24) dialog: Hey, wait.
56) 28) dialog: (whispering) Look. You still have seven Minutes. Don’t you have that baby- sitter until 11?
56) 30) dialog: That’s true. We can’t. But time is so precious. Buddy’s words are slurred.
56) 32) dialog: You’re a great father. You’re already going above and beyond in so many ways. Remember when we were kids? Dads didn’t have to do shit. They came and they went and we still bought them new golf balls and tie tacks on Father’s Day. But you-- you’ve really stepped up to the plate. You do too much, even. Now Buddy’s voice has become similarly low and intimate.
56) 34) dialog: Yes. You’re such a good, good man, Buddy. Don’t ever shortchange yourself. Buddy chuckles softly and drunkenly. His hand has wandered to Mavis’s bare arm. It’s a friendly grip, more for balance than anything, but there’s tension now.
56) 38) dialog: I know. And that’s the only thing that matters. Not Beth, not anything-- Buddy and Mavis’s faces meet in a KISS. It’s a hard close mouthed kiss, but a kiss nonetheless. Buddy pulls away.
56) 43) dialog: (exaggerating) Beth wanted to stay out all night and party.
56) 46) dialog: Good night, Buddy.
57) 0) text: The transition is sudden, but we can immediately see that Mavis and Freehauf are drowning their sorrows again. Mavis is mid-rant.
57) 1) dialog: Fuck! Freehauf is fiddling with the jukebox.
57) 2) dialog: Hey. Hey Matt, know what I hate? Matt. Know what I hate? Water.
57) 4) dialog: I do, I hate water! Do you know what Frank Sinatra used to say when someone offered him a glass water? He’d go, (doing Frank) “I'm thirsty, not dirty!” Matt punches in some Guns n’ Roses.
57) 5) dialog: Water just tastes. Like. A toilet.
57) 7) dialog: I’m on a bender. This is what people on benders do.
57) 9) dialog: Because I’m depressed. (CONTINUED)
57) 13) dialog: Why don’t you walk, fat ass?
57) 15) dialog: What?
57) 17) dialog: (surprised) Ugh. My cousin Mike.
57) 19) dialog: Yeah, but it’s not like we’re in touch. He’s not even my first cousin. He’s my mom’s cousin.
57) 21) dialog: (annoyed) How often do you see your cousins?
57) 28) dialog: I’m just in town taking care of a real estate thing. And how are you?
57) 30) dialog: Six years, what is that, wood? Porcelain?
57) 34) dialog: (dry) ; Yeah, you should try it, Matt.
57) 39) dialog: It is!
57) 43) dialog: Sophomore homecoming. Car wreck. He got so much attention. She rolls her eyes. Matt laughs.
57) 44) dialog: He did, he practically ruined my Sweet Sixteen. Well, just the family party, but still.
57) 46) dialog: You’re a dumb piece of shit. MATT loudly clinks Mavis’s stationary glass. Mavis responds in a quieter way: She puts her glass against his and holds it there for a beat, like a kiss.
58) 3) dialog: (to passerby) Dogs are okay here, right? Baguette leaps out and runs as fast as his tiny legs will allow. It’s a Born Free moment as he flies across the grass, overjoyed to be out of the Homeway Suites and finally getting some attention. The park is fenced, and he’s good to go. Mavis watches him, pleased. She sits down on a bench and unwraps one of those granola bars that’s marketed to women. She takes out her laptop and opens it. She opens pieceofshit.word and begins typing. Ashby and Isabella had a bond that could not broken. This, everyone knew. However, Isbella could not could not could not Mavis looks up, up checking on the dog.
58) 4) dialog: Good, Baguette! Is this fun? It definitely is fun. A MAN walks by and admires the prancing dog.
58) 6) dialog: (to man) He’s crazy about this park. Mavis’s CELL PHONE rings. It’s Buddy. Oh my God! Mavis stares at the ringing phone as if it’s an oracle.
58) 7) dialog: (to herself) Hello. Hello. (warmly ) Hey you! That’s it. (CONTINUED)
58) 10) dialog: (picking up) Hey you!
58) 14) dialog: I’m good. I’m good. What is it, Bud?
58) 16) dialog: Secular.
58) 18) dialog: I would love to come.
58) 23) dialog: Okay. Great, Bud. ‘Bye. Mavis hangs up, quietly thrilled. She hops.
59) 0) text: Mavis is walking back from the park with Baguette in his bag. Her spirits are high.
59) 1) dialog: (to bag) Maybe we’ll go again tomorrow. What do you think? No response from the bag.
59) 2) dialog: Good boy. There’s a SILVER LINCOLN SEDAN slowly cruising down the street. After a few beats, we realize it’s tailing Mavis. Mavis doesn’t notice right away, but eventually looks over her shoulder. The car’s halting pace is suspicious. Finally, Mavis stops. The car also stops. Mavis shades her eyes from the sun. Finally, Mavis addresses the driver in an odd tone.
59) 3) dialog: May I help you?
59) 5) dialog: You got me. (CONTINUED)
59) 9) dialog: I wasn’t avoiding you. I was planning to call.
59) 11) dialog: David is not my father.
59) 13) dialog: I saw.
59) 15) dialog: No.
59) 17) dialog: With a friend. You don’t know them. I’m here doing research for one of the books. Watching teenagers. That’s why I was at the park. (CONTINUED)
59) 21) dialog: Well, tweens, Mom. Tweens are our core demo anyway. Ten through twelve. Or even, like, seven through twelve.
59) 23) dialog: Kids are reading sooner because of Twilight and Harry Potter. The literacy rate is through the roof. It’s great. She’s lying like crazy.
59) 25) dialog: Where are we going?
59) 29) dialog: Hi David. (CONTINUED)
59) 34) dialog: (nervous laughter) Limited engagement. David studies her.
59) 36) dialog: I’m an alcoholic.
59) 45) dialog: I was 13 and in my underwear and my stepfather was pouring soup on my head. My new stepfather. Even while I was screaming and begging him not too. She directs this at Hedda, not David.
59) 47) dialog: I want you guys to know up front that I can’t stay long. I’m ona deadline.
59) 52) dialog: How is that weight-bearing?
59) 58) dialog: I know. I’ve know for ages. We’re still quite close.
59) 63) dialog: I’m not jealous at all. Buddy is one of my favorite people I’ve ever known. He’s very dear to me. And the baby is part of him, so-- I love it too.
59) 73) dialog: May I be excused for a moment? David has seized Baguette and is holding him high in the air.
60) 0) text: Mavis exits the room. In the hallway, there’s a large WEDDING PICTURE in a silver frame. (CONTINUED)
61) 0) text: Mavis emerges downstairs, stuffing the red sweatshirt into Baguette’s bag.
61) 1) dialog: Can you take down that wedding picture of me and Allen? Hedda is washing some greens in a colander.
61) 3) dialog: Can you take down my wedding picture?
61) 5) dialog: Allen’s still alive.
61) 7) dialog: Why would I keep in touch with Allen's nephew?
61) 12) dialog: And I’ve told you a million times you’re wrong. Hedda reaches to smooth Mavis hair. Her hand wanders instinctively underneath, near Mavis’s ear. She feels the bald patch and reacts.
61) 18) dialog: I believe you.
61) 24) dialog: Get it away! Get it away!
61) 26) dialog: (shrieking) Yes, you stupid asshole, I did!
61) 28) dialog: All right, let’s not get silly. EXT. MATT’S HOUSE - EVENING Hedda’s car pulls up to the house. Matt is outside smoking. He barely blinks at the sight of Mavis’s arrival. INT. HEDDA’S CAR - SAME
61) 30) dialog: (hurried) Yes. Thanks for the ride. Hedda scrutinizes the semi-dilapidated house (and the semi-dilapidated man smoking in front of it.) (CONTINUED)
61) 35) dialog: ‘Bye, Mom. I’1l call.
61) 38) dialog: That was my mother. I would prefer if she didn’t know where I’m staying. Matt nods.
61) 39) dialog: (serious) You don’t know what she’s capable of.
61) 41) dialog: Wanna go smoke in the woods or something? Matt stands up, with effort.
61) 45) dialog: (as if) No.
62) 0) text: Mercury High is lit up like a brick prison. Past the football and soccer fields, there’s a small wooded area. Mavis and Matt trek through the overgrowth. Mavis shivers in her tank top. She reaches into her purse and takes out the RED SWEATSHIRT she found at her parent’s house. She pulls it on. It’s a traditional high school P.E. shirt. On the front label, there’s a large surname written in Magic Marker: SLADE. Buddy glances at the shirt but doesn’t say anything.
62) 1) dialog: Our school is so ugly. It looks just like a factory.
62) 3) dialog: You know everything. Mavis takes a swig from a flask. She touches a tree trunk fondly.
62) 4) dialog: These woods were like fuck city back in the day. I remember being out here with a few different guys. Naturally, none of them knew what they were doing, but I...
62) 6) dialog: I wasn't. (cruelly) I was normal. (CONTINUED)
62) 10) dialog: Me neither. And I don’t particularly miss those days. If I want someone to touch my pussy the wrong way, I’1ll just call my ex- husband...
62) 12) dialog: Ah. I did know that, I think.
62) 14) dialog: I knew it was somewhere around here. (awkward) I’m sorry. Is this triggering?
62) 16) dialog: What was it like, when those guys were beating you? I mean, do you mind my asking. Did you say something to set them off?
62) 18) dialog: Oh please, it’s so old. I’m just curious. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
62) 21) dialog: I mean, I’m with you every day-- for whatever reason-- and you have your gimp stick and that you get the migraines and all that, so I’m curious. What is it like to get beaten like that?
62) 23) dialog: I don’t jerk off to anything. How dare you? Oh my God, Matt, that’s so insensitive. You don’t know what I’ve overcome.
62) 25) dialog: Why are you being an asshole all of a sudden?
62) 27) dialog: I think it’s time for me to go home to Minneapolis. I want to go back to the city. I don’t know why I’m here, I don’t know how I got involved with a married man...
62) 29) dialog: (sarcastic) Oh yeah, Matt, devout husbands and fathers go to bars alone with their ex-girlfriends all the time. They call them privately to invite them to things. They make out with them on the porch.... (CONTINUED)
62) 33) dialog: You weren’t there. It was really intense and passionate. (pointing) This is his shirt. The giant SLADE on the front of the shirt could not be more obvious.
62) 35) dialog: Well, you’re hardly perfect, Matt. All you care about is that some kids jumped you 20 years ago. You lean on that crutch and you lean on people, and you and I both know that you’ve used the whole thing as an excuse to be a failure.
62) 37) dialog: You can get past that. You have to move on! (CONTINUED)
62) 40) dialog: You could care less about right or wrong. You’re just jealous because as it turns out, he might actually want to be with me. Matt laughs angrily.
62) 42) dialog: Let’s get out of here.
62) 44) dialog: It's really a shame that you’re like this. If you had a good personality, none of the other stuff would matter to people.
62) 49) dialog: There’s a reason why you and I can’t be real friends.
63) 0) text: Mavis enters the big, chain video store Matt urged her to avoid. The light is fluorescent, sickly. She faces a massive wall of DVDs, surrounded by bright promotional placards and stuffed toys. All 50 DVDs are identical. A sign reads “WE HAVE IT IN STOCK-- GUARANTEED!”

MAVIS’S CAR - DAY Mavis is dolled up in another one of her indie designer dresses. Today is the day of Buddy’s party, and it’s the perfect excuse to look her best. She drives her MINI Cooper into a strip mall parking lot. MUSIC UNDER. END MONTAGE. INT. BABIES R’ US - DAY Mavis walks in, overwhelmed by all the bright, adorable merchandise. She strolls down the aisles, looking lithe and alien next to all the dumpy moms buying breast pumps and onesies. Her high heels clack against the dirty linoleum. She approaches a display of beribboned BURP CLOTHS and looks at them. A YOUNG DAD is shopping nearby. He’s fairly paunchy and average-looking, but he and Mavis exchange smiles. Mavis postures expertly, being cute with him. Her stance is pigeon-toed, her smile is radiant. She’s an incredible flirt. Dad is enchanted. Mavis’s smile lasts a beat too long, and Dad’s begins to fade imperceptibly.

68) 13) dialog: No. Jane MacMurray created the series, but I wrote the book. I'm Mavis Gary. Crane. See? She points to the flyleaf, which does indeed read: “Story by Jane MacMurray. Written by Mavis Gary-Crane.”
68) 15) dialog: I know her very well. (indignant) I wrote this book.
68) 17) dialog: Would you like a signed copy for the store? (CONTINUED)
68) 21) dialog: I’1l sign as many as you want. It adds value to your stock.
68) 23) dialog: Why would you send these back to the publisher?!

68) 26) dialog: Hi, Jan.
68) 28) dialog: I’ve been a busy lady. (CONTINUED)
68) 32) dialog: I’m so glad for you. Buddy intercepts at just the right moment.
68) 34) dialog: I brought a present. She offers the gift bag awkwardly.
68) 35) dialog: They’re just um, burp cloths.
68) 42) dialog: (to Buddy) Here’s that book. For Kendra. Your niece. Buddy is grateful, but he barely glances at the book.
68) 44) dialog: There’s a character in this one that I based on you.
68) 46) dialog: In the book. I mean, I named him Ashby, but it’s so blatantly you. When you read it, it’1l be obvious.
68) 48) dialog: We’re not even supposed to do that. We’re supposed to stick to this character bible? But I Managed to slip it through. I had some things I wanted to say to you so I thought I would use the book to-- Mavis realizes Buddy is totally distracted. He’s grabbed a LITTLE BOY and has turned the shrieking child upside- down. The boy’s giggles drown out Mavis.
68) 50) dialog: You must be overwhelmed, Buddy. (CONTINUED)
68) 54) dialog: Because of all of it.
68) 56) dialog: But you’re not.
68) 69) dialog: I would be if I could get a drink.
68) 72) dialog: Oh my God. Oh my God. Fuck you! Fuck you! Beth backs off, blinking. The edge on Mavis’s voice grabs people’s attention. Conversation stops. Mavis laughs.
68) 73) dialog: I’m just joking, Beth. God, you should see your face. You’re just standing there like a big lump. Beth’s confused half-smile fades.
68) 74) dialog: No, just kidding. For real, I love your jersey. She tugs on the sleeve of Beth’s loose-fitting, square- shaped dress. It does look a bit like a football jersey. (CONTINUED)

68) 78) dialog: You guys sure have a lot of rags around here. Burp cloths, whatever. Hey, use some’a mine that I just bought you. Everyone is staring at Mavis. MAVIS (CONT’D) The funny thing is, I actually could have had this party a long time ago. I mean, this very same party. Buddy and I were together for four years. (nodding toward Jan) Jan knows. Jan looks away, already mortified.
68) 79) dialog: Remember? We were inseparable, in more ways than one! Ooh, I’m sorry, Jan, Kirk... Buddy got me pregnant. A few embarrassed gasps from the crowd. Beth appears, proffering a rag.
68) 81) dialog: No, don’t worry. It’s linen. It’s fucked. 95. Beth gently and discreetly tries to towel off Mavis, but Mavis resists, pushing her away.
68) 82) dialog: (loudly) Wait, I’m telling a story. Buddy got me pregnant when I was 20, when we were almost broken up. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
68) 85) dialog: Maybe if things had been a little bit more hospitable, you know, down south, in my broken body, Buddy and I would be here right now. With a teenager, and probably even more kids. We always came back to each other. Always. Didn’t we, Jan? The GARAGE DOOR opens noisily. Reveal Buddy’s legs, then Buddy’s entire body, then Buddy’s smiling face. He stands expectantly next to a BRAND NEW DRUM KIT. There’s a jaunty BOW tied to the ride cymbal. Nobody says a word.
68) 90) dialog: What do you mean, nothing? What’s wrong with you? Are you one of those kids who needs a chart to learn feelings? Why are you covering for me? Stand up for yourself, Beth!
68) 92) dialog: I’ve been drunk the whole time I’ve been back and nobody gave a fuck until (indicating Beth) this one got bent out of shape... She stumbles away from Beth. Buddy charges forward and herds her over to the fence, trying to move her away from the crowd.
68) 94) dialog: You invited me, Buddy.
68) 99) dialog: (to Buddy) You're lying. Beth’s voice is low and sad.
68) 101) dialog: What about now? Do you hate me now? I hate you, so it should be easy. What the fuck is wrong with you people? Mavis tries to stagger out of the yard, but accidentally misses the gate.
68) 103) dialog: (departing) I came back for you. For you. And I hate this town. It’s a hick lake town that smells like fish shit. I just want you to know that. Mavis leaves. Someone hands Beth the baby. Beth holds her daughter close.
69) 0) text: The doorbell chimes. Matt limps to the door. Sandra watches America’s Funniest Home Videos in the background. Matt opens the door to reveal Mavis, weeping hysterically. Her dress is covered in punch, and she’s practically incoherent.
69) 1) dialog: I screwed up so bad! I screwed up so bad! (CONTINUED)
69) 8) dialog: I’m crazy. And no one loves me.
69) 10) dialog: You don’t love me.
69) 12) dialog: I went to Buddy’s house.
69) 17) dialog: My dress is ruined. She reaches down and PULLS OFF her stained dress in one rapid gesture. She’s not wearing a bra, just cotton underwear. Matt shrinks away.
69) 19) dialog: I want your shirt. Matt looks down at his Hanes Beefy Tee.
69) 21) dialog: You hide me. She reaches for Matt. He can’t help but reach back, partially to embrace her, but also so they both feel less naked. They hug tightly, obscuring each other’s bare chests. It’s Matt, surprisingly, who tips Mavis down onto her back. He buries his face into her hair. From underneath, Mavis helps Matt take off his pants. She pulls off his underwear, exposing him completely. Her own underwear are so small they barely count. Neither of them are really moving, but Matt’s in between her legs. (CONTINUED)
69) 26) dialog: What?
69) 28) dialog: But they’re all mothers. Everyone thinks it’s so admirable.
69) 31) dialog: Really? (long beat) In what way?
69) 36) dialog: I hate that Mary Ellen girl.
69) 38) dialog: HA! I knew she was starving herself. She was a parade float in high school.
69) 40) dialog: Okay. She plays it casual, but she’s smiling in the darkness. Matt waits a few moments, but he has a question he can’t keep to himself.
69) 42) dialog: He’s a good man. He’s kind.
69) 44) dialog: Sometimes. Matt listens. (CONTINUED)
69) 47) dialog: He knew me when I was at my best.
69) 49) dialog: (finally) There. INT. MATT’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - MORNING Mavis wakes up in Matt’s bed. Matt is still asleep. She slips out easily and puts on her soiled dress. INT. MATT’S HOUSE (DOWNSTAIRS) - MORNING Mavis creeps downstairs. Sandra is standing in the kitchen washing dishes before work. She wears nurse’s scrubs and the sides of her permed hair are slicked back into a dated half-ponytail look. A coffee pot percolates on the counter. Sandra turns around and sees Mavis. Sandra’s face is bare and homely. A morning face, on a non-morning person.
69) 50) dialog: Good morning.
69) 52) dialog: Coffee? Sandra nods. Mavis walks into the kitchen and takes two mugs off the counter. (CONTINUED)
69) 56) dialog: How about some milk?
69) 58) dialog: Tell me when.
69) 60) dialog: How are you? Sandra doesn’t know what to say.
69) 61) dialog: Tell me about yourself.
69) 63) dialog: That’s great.
69) 65) dialog: No. The series is over. It was cancelled. I’m actually writing the last book right now.
70) 0) text: Mavis enters. The room is in shambles. There’s some dog shit in the background. She scoops Baguette into her arms, genuinely feeling horrible for having left him all night.
70) 1) dialog: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I won’t leave you like this again. Baguette licks her, immediately forgiving like all dogs.
70) 2) dialog: I’m sorry, Baguette. I’m sorry. She buries kisses in his fur over and over again. She starts crying.
71) 0) text: Mavis appears with her luggage and dog in tow. The original blonde front desk girl is working.
71) 2) dialog: Yes. Mavis slides her two key cards onto the desk.
71) 4) dialog: I’m not sentmimental.
71) 6) dialog: I don’t have diabetes.
71) 10) dialog: Yeah?
72) 0) text: Mavis eats a donut as she piles her stuff into the car. INT. MAVIS’S CAR - DAY Mavis drives down the highway, listening to local radio. Baguette sticks his head out the window. INT. ROADSIDE DENNY’S - DAY Mavis sits in a booth and types on her laptop. We read: Yes, Ashby was dead. But Isabella would survive. She’d been accepted to Harvard, after all, and she had her whole life ahead of her. “Life, here I come” Isabella declared. Mavis pauses, then resumes typing.
74) 0) text: A downtown bridge spanning the Mississippi River. A scenic overlook. Mavis sits behind the wheel, expressionless. (CONTINUED)
75) 0) text: Ambient CHEERING and crowd noises. It’s a lavish graduation ceremony at the fantasy school. Our blonde STUDENT-- Mavis-- wears a blue graduation cap and gown. She’s accessorised with a tiny gold pin that Says HARVARD. She turns to a friend, mouths, “I’m outta here,” with an arch of her eyebrow, and heads up to the front of the room with queen-bee confidence. As she walks up to fetch her diploma, she smiles like a supermodel. The crowd goes wild with appreciation. Diploma in hand, she reaches up and flicks the cap’s golden tassel from the left side to the right, in the signature rite of passage. The cheers from the audience grow stronger. She gazes out at the crowd. We don’t recognize anyone, until... Buddy appears in the front row. He stands up proudly, his arms filled with flowers. Her face lights up as she recognizes him. He’s always in her dreams, never not there. The applause grows, and grows, and cuts out suddenly. THE END.
