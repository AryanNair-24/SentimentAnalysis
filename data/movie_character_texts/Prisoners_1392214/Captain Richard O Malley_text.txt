33) 42) dialog: Fuck you. You find his daughter, he'll forgive you, you don’t, he’s gonna hate you anyway. Loki takes that in. O’Malley gives him a long look... CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY (CONT’D) Had my buddy from PSP’s homicide unit over for Thanksgiving... Loki looks a little caught...
33) 43) dialog: If you wanted a transfer you should've asked me. PSP’s homicide unit is a fine place to be -- I’m sure you'd fit right in there. But you’re getting ahead of yourself a little bit, don’t you think?
33) 45) dialog: Nothing. Why should you say anything? Not like I ever did anything for you. Some guilt sneaks into Loki’s expression --

46) 5) dialog: I know your Dad was a guard at Graterford, and I got a daughter of my own so I’m gonna show some mercy on you. O'Malley uncuffs Keller from the chair. Keller stands up.
46) 6) dialog: As for Alex Jones, he has orders not to leave the commonwealth.
46) 8) dialog: Mr. Dover, tell Detective Loki what you told me -- he will definitely look into it. And when you're done, I need you to go home. Your family needs you at home, not hanging around here. Before Keller can argue O'Malley exits into THE CHAOTIC HALLWAY and shuts the door.
55) 16) dialog: (over the phone) Results came back for the corpse in the priest’s basement. No DNA, dental or fingerprint matches. The priest is sticking to his story; thinks he killed the next Ted Bundy.
61) 2) dialog: You said the runner at the vigil is our guy. I don’t have money in the budget for watching innocent people. O'Malley sees a sliver of doubt in Loki’s eyes before Loki can conceal it. Loki opens the door, and as he exits --
112) 3) dialog: How long has he been working on this...map? Loki looks at his watch wearily.
112) 5) dialog: You think it’s gonna lead you to the bodies? ‘Cause I sure as shit don’t.

You want fulfillment, start a family, have some kids. INT. LOKI’S DESK - CONYERS POLICE STATION - DAY 164 Loki walks to his desk, staring deliriously at the disarray. He straight-arms everything to the floor, computer monitor and all. No one walking by dares make mention of this. His desk is now bare but for an evidence bag containing Jones' matchbox RV. He sits down, takes the little RV out of the bag and sets it on his desk. He gives it the tiniest push, watching as it slowly rolls off the edge -- He reaches down to pick it up when something on the floor catches his eye... The crime scene photos of the corpse he found in Father Dunn’s basement. A close-up of the pendant the corpse was wearing with the maze carved into it. Suddenly energized, he pulls the photocopy of Bob's map from his pocket, unfolds it and sets it on the desk next to the photo of the corpse's pendant... THEY'RE IDENTICAL. Loki’s astounded. His cell phone RINGS.
