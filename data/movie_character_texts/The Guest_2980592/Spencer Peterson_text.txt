PETERSON HOUSE - CALEB’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Anna walks into Caleb’s room, leaving the door behind her open. The room appears much as before. David’s rucksack rests on the floor, mostly empty. Anna looks towards the doorway, then crouches down and peers into David’s rucksack. She reaches inside, searching its contents. The bag contains only undergarments, socks, and a tube of deodorant. Anna straightens up. Anna looks around the room, taking in Caleb’s belongings. She sighs, then sits down on the bed. Anna looks down at the pillow she is sitting on. She shifts her weight and lifts up the pillow. A polished PISTOL is beneath the pillow on Caleb's bed. Anna takes this in, then carefully puts the pillow back into place over the gun, as before. Anna starts to stand up, looking to the door. DAVID IS STANDING in the doorway to the room, WATCHING HER. Anna gasps and quickly stands, taking a step back.

15) 3) dialog: Yeah. (beat) So what about you? What are your plans?
15) 5) dialog: That's crazy. You... you should stay with us a couple more days. Look for jobs online.
15) 7) dialog: No, that’s... and what’s with this “sir” business? My name’s Spencer.
15) 9) dialog: Stick around, at least until you know where you’re going. Okay? David looks like he is thinking, then nods.

15) 14) dialog: You tired?

PETERSON HOUSE - CALEB’S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER In Caleb’s bedroom, David lies on the bed, fully dressed. He is visible by moonlight coming in through the window. David lies completely still. A breeze moves the barren branches of the tree outside; they shift, CREAKING. David glances over at this sound. After a moment, David quietly rises from the bed.

31) 37) dialog: I need a drink. Spencer crosses to a liquor cabinet and pours whiskey out into a tumbler.

31) 40) dialog: They found him and his girlfriend dead. They'd both taken pills, I guess he had some prescriptions... It looks like a suicide pact kind of thing.
31) 42) dialog: Totally normal. Yeah. The police are investigating. There was nothing in their wall safe, but it wasn’t broken into... but she had some bruises... I guess we'll have to see what the police say.
31) 44) dialog: I guess we’ll find out. Spencer finishes his drink. 55.
31) 45) dialog: The damned thing is, this means I’m regional manager. At least, for a while. As soon as corporate heard, I got a call. They're offering me the same salary as Allan to start right away.
31) 47) dialog: Hey, David. I didn’t hear you come in. David is standing in the kitchen doorway, holding shopping bags. Anna takes a step back, startled.
31) 49) dialog: That’s okay. Thank you. Care for a drink?
47) 2) dialog: Anna? What’s wrong?
47) 9) dialog: I’m sorry, Anna, but if they arrested your ex-boyfriend, it could be for a good reason. Zeke Hastings was never exactly a pillar of the community. Anna's eyes blaze with fury.

47) 13) dialog: I know he’s a druggy burn-out who started dating my daughter when she was seventeen-

47) 25) dialog: You watch your mouth, young lady! Spencer stops and takes a breath. 68.
47) 26) dialog: I am very sorry about your friend Craig. But as for Zeke Hastings and his crew, I have it on good authority that they’re a bunch of pot dealers! You know why they arrested Zeke for the murder? Because he probably did it, Anna!
