The only other patrons are two OLDER MEN seated at the bar and a group of FOUR HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR GUYS, including Mike, Ian and Jason, who are gathered with an equal number of GIRLS their age in two booths. David looks up as Luke enters and waves him over.

Luke sits at an empty desk and immediately takes out his netbook, opening it to an internet browser. JASON is seated behind Luke. He has a BANDAGE over his NOSE and his face is BRUISED. Jason regards Luke balefully, then reaches and POKES LUKE WITH HIS PENCIL. Luke exhales but says nothing.

49) 3) dialog: You little bitch- Jason grabs Luke with one hand, PULLING HIM UP OUT OF HIS SEAT, and PUNCHES HIM with the other. Luke staggers back, falling to land right near a chalkboard at the back of the room. There is a wooden YARDSTICK leaning against the wall next to him. Jason touches his bruised face where Luke hit him, then furiously strides forward. The YARDSTICK, swung by Luke, catches Jason across the MIDDLE OF HIS FACE. It breaks in half, splinters flying everywhere. Jason STUMBLES BACK, holding his injured face. He YELLS with pain. Luke stands at the back of the classroom, holding the remains of the shattered yardstick, catching his breath. He smiles slightly. INT.
