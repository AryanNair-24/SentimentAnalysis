The young man’s hair is cropped short and he has an athletic build. Although he is running steadily at a fast rate, the man’s breathing is quiet and regular. The man in the army uniform continues to run as an old PICK-UP TRUCK appears in the distance behind him. INT. ANNA’S CAR - EARLY MORNING —- CONTINUOUS ANNA PETERSON, a pretty 20 year old with dark hair, drives the pick-up truck down the country road. Her eyes are tired and her mascara smeared, as if she has been up all night. Anna looks through her windshield at the man running on the side of the road. He is running in the same direction that Anna is driving, so she sees only his back. Anna frowns slightly at this sight, then continues driving, moving past the young man as he runs along. Glancing at her rearview mirror, Anna watches his figure recede into the distance behind her.
1) 0) text: Anna pulls her truck into the driveway of a single-story house surrounded by fields of dead grass. Two other cars are parked in the driveway, an SUV and a station wagon. Paper HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS hang outside of the house, and a homemade GHOST stands in the front yard, facing the street, its eyes black holes etched into white bedsheet. Anna climbs out of the truck. Behind her, the sun is beginning to rise, filling the sky with pale light. Anna regards the ghost standing in front of her, then heads towards the house.
2) 0) text: Anna opens the front door to the house and enters, moving quietly, as if trying to not be heard. Anna softly shuts the door behind her. She turns and see her father, SPENCER PETERSON, 40s, seated on the couch in the dim morning light, watching her. He is wearing slacks and a dress shirt and holding a mug of coffee. Anna slumps back against the closed front door, startled.

2) 5) dialog: Yeah, um. I fell asleep. Sorry.
2) 7) dialog: I said I was sorry. Alone, Spencer stands in the front room, facing the hall. The sound of Anna CLOSING her bedroom door is audible. Spencer turns to the mantle above the fireplace. A plastic jack-o’-lantern sits next to photos of a young man smiling, in various settings. This is CALEB PETERSON. There is a shot of Caleb in a football uniform and, most recently, a posed shot of him in an army uniform, standing with a group of soldiers in front of a military vehicle. An AMERICAN FLAG is folded into a glass frame that hangs over these photos. Spencer exhales, his shoulders slumping.

Laura looks up, startled. She clumsily rises to her feet, straightens her clothing, then moves to the front door and opens it. The YOUNG MAN in army uniform who Anna saw running is standing on the porch, facing away from the door, as if surveying the front yard. He is still carrying his rucksack, his back to Laura. Laura gasps, her eyes widening. The young man turns to her, smiling politely. He is very good looking, in a boyish way, with very short blond hair. This is DAVID. David takes in Laura’s expression. He frowns, concerned.

Next to her, ZEKE HASTINGS, mid-20s, lights a marijuana pipe and exhales smoke up into the cool air. Anna’s truck and a van that belongs to Zeke are both parked near a gravel road behind them. MUSIC plays from a tinny battery-powered boombox next to their blanket. Anna checks the time on her cell phone, sighs, and sits up. She begins pulling on her boots.
12) 1) dialog: I’ve got to go home. Zeke offers the pipe to Anna, who shakes her head, tying her bootlaces. Zeke lights it again, inhaling.

12) 8) dialog: It’s just... I mean, you kind of knew Caleb. We’ve all... I know mom and dad have been trying to move on. It’s not like they don’t have enough reminders of him in this town. Hell, they’ve kept that bedroom like a shrine to him.
12) 10) dialog: We just don’t need a walking, breathing reminder of Caleb hanging around right now, you know?
12) 13) dialog: I’m going to be late as is. But I’m sure we can find some time at the party tomorrow.

PETERSON HOUSE - CALEB’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS Anna walks into Caleb’s room, leaving the door behind her open. The room appears much as before. David’s rucksack rests on the floor, mostly empty. Anna looks towards the doorway, then crouches down and peers into David’s rucksack. She reaches inside, searching its contents. The bag contains only undergarments, socks, and a tube of deodorant. Anna straightens up. Anna looks around the room, taking in Caleb’s belongings. She sighs, then sits down on the bed. Anna looks down at the pillow she is sitting on. She shifts her weight and lifts up the pillow. A polished PISTOL is beneath the pillow on Caleb's bed. Anna takes this in, then carefully puts the pillow back into place over the gun, as before. Anna starts to stand up, looking to the door. DAVID IS STANDING in the doorway to the room, WATCHING HER. Anna gasps and quickly stands, taking a step back.

21) 15) dialog: I’m going to get ready for Kristen’s.
21) 17) dialog: Really?! You're going to play that card? Laura’s reply is inaudible. A moment later, Anna storms out of the kitchen. She clears her throat.
21) 18) dialog: David, would you like to come to a party with me tonight? David looks up at Anna.
21) 20) dialog: (barely concealed annoyance) Great. I’m going to leave around seven. David rises to his feet.

22) 1) dialog: Great. (calling out) Luke, I need to shower! The bathroom door immediately opens and David steps out in a haze of steam, wearing a towel around his waist. David appears almost unnaturally fit, each muscle defined. His tanned torso is also covered with flushed, thick SCARS from dozens of cuts and wounds. 34. David moves towards the door to Caleb’s room, edging past Anna in the narrow hallway.
22) 3) dialog: No, I- I’m sorry, I thought Luke was-— Never mind.

22) 90) dialog: Wait. How are you more sober than me?
22) 94) dialog: No, it’s just... it’s nothing. We had an argument. Old stuff. Zeke... When we first started dating, I loved that he was in a band. But now I’m saving up for college, and he just isn’t moving on, you know? Like, he doesn’t even have a job.
22) 97) dialog: He’s not a drug dealer! (pause) He sells drugs sometimes. Like, to friends, to make extra cash. David reaches up and adjusts the rearview mirror.
22) 100) dialog: Thanks. David drives in silence for a moment.

Anna writes on the CD: “MIX FOR DAVID.” She then moves back to her bed and opens her laptop. INT. PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER Anna leans back on her bed, slipping on her headphones.

47) 32) dialog: Okay. Kristen. Anna taps one of the numbers, then scrolls through her contacts, bringing up “CRAIG.” Craig’s number matches the last number that called David’s phone.
47) 33) dialog: Craig... 69. Anna goes back to the photo. Only one number remains. Anna frowns at it, then opens up her netbook. She punches the phone number into an internet search page. There is a soft KNOCK on Anna’s door.

47) 40) dialog: Okay.
47) 43) dialog: Uh. Yeah.
48) 4) dialog: Yeah. I paid for a reverse directory thing to look that number up online. It said it’s the unlisted landline of this doctor in Miami. His name’s Peter Boddington. Except he’s not a doctor anymore. He got his license taken away two years ago when he performed a face lift on this lady while he was drunk. Luke hands Anna’s phone back to her.
48) 6) dialog: That's what I want to find out.
48) 8) dialog: I need to talk to the police. The cops found those drugs in Zeke’s room and assume they’ve got their guy. The investigation’s closed. Zeke’s lawyer is telling him to take a plea. Luke looks mildly suspicious.
48) 10) dialog: To get them to reopen it, I need all the information I can get. You remember how you stole a password for that database to do research on your paper last year?
48) 12) dialog: Well, do something like that again. Find out anything you can about this guy. Luke looks pensive.
48) 14) dialog: Yeah. I do.

82) 3) dialog: I need you to trust me, Luke. Come on. And be quiet. Anna pulls Luke forward, down the corridor.
85) 2) dialog: Come on! Anna turns right at the end of the corridor, in the opposite direction of the path she took earlier. She and Luke round another corner, disappearing from view. The next moment, David appears, turning into the corridor they just vacated. He looks around, listens, then turns towards the front entrance, moving quietly. INT. MAPLEWOOD BARN - ENTRY MAZE —- JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS Anna and Luke hurry deeper into the maze, rounding another corner. Luke and Anna find themselves in a CHAMBER in the maze, filled with barrels and debris, designed like a JUNKYARD. There is a stack of barrels in one corner that appears designed for a maze employee to hide behind in order to jump out and scare people. A GORE-STREAKED dummy is propped in front of the barrels. Anna quickly pulls Luke towards the stack of barrels.
85) 3) dialog: I need you to hide in here. Okay? Luke looks at the hiding space, then shakes his head.
85) 5) dialog: Luke. He killed mom and dad. They're gone. Luke blinks. He smiles hesitantly.
85) 8) dialog: Please. Just hide here, okay? I’m going to lead him away. Don’t come out unless you hear me or the police. Okay? Luke hesitates, then nods, staring as if dazed. He steps back behind the stack of barrels, disappearing from view. Anna quickly shifts one of the barrels, further hiding Luke.
85) 9) dialog: (whispering) I’1l come back for you. Anna turns and runs deeper into the dark maze. Anna turns a corner, then another. She finds herself facing a DEAD END. Hurriedly, Anna backtracks to her last turn, going the other direction, disappearing from view. On the other side of the maze wall from Anna, David walks deeper into the maze, turning corners, still holding the BLOODY BOX CUTTER in front of him. David speaks LOUDLY.
87) 2) dialog: You killed my parents. David blinks, shifting his weight almost imperceptibly.
88) 0) text: The fog parts as David falls heavily to the floor. He does not move. Anna steps from the mirror maze, the gun in her hand aimed down at David. The fog shifts back in, OBSCURING DAVID from view. Anna hesitates, then steps forward, WAVING her free hand in front of her, WAFTING the fog from her path. David is NO LONGER ON THE FLOOR in front of her. Anna spins around and is STABBED IN THE LEG with the box cutter BLADE. It tears into her flesh through her tights. She falls to the floor, YELLING in pain. David is crouched in the fog, the front of his shirt soaked with his BLOOD. He grins at Anna, his teeth bloody, then LUNGES FORWARD at her. Anna AIMS THE PISTOL at David. David KNOCKS IT ASIDE, gripping Anna’s wrist as she FIRES. The bullet hits the GRIM REAPER dummy in the corner of the room, knocking it over. It falls forward, onto a bale of HAY. Its LANTERN sends FLAMES out onto the hay. David WRENCHES the pistol from Anna’s grasp. It goes skittering across the floor, disappearing into the fog. David reaches out and GRABS Anna’s NECK with both hands. He tightens his grip, CHOKING HER. They struggle, both of them crouched in the fog on the dance floor, MUSIC BLARING. Anna CLAWS at David's hands as he compresses the arteries in her neck. She struggles, going to her knees, frantically trying to pull back his fingers. David exhales with exertion. Behind him, the bale of HAY is STARTING TO BURN, the flames filling the fog around them with FLICKERING LIGHT that illuminates David’s face.
88) 5) dialog: Thank you.
88) 7) dialog: Yeah. Are you? Luke nods. Anna regards Luke for a moment, then they make their way towards the dark maze leading to the front entrance. Behind them, the flames have ENGULFED the far wall, and the fire is BUILDING steadily. Luke supports Anna as she limps slightly, her arm across his shoulders.

Behind them, the fire in the building appears to have been extinguished, SMOKE RISING from the building’s burnt portions. FIREMEN carry equipment to their trucks. The large parking lot is filled with black SUVs and police cars with LIGHTS FLASHING. At the back of the ambulance, a PARAMEDIC shines a light into Anna's eyes, then glances over at Luke.
91) 0) text: At the rear of the ambulance, Luke leans over and rests his head on Anna’s shoulder. Anna puts her arm around him. She looks around, surveying the activity around the smoldering building. As Anna watches, one of the masked fireman emerges from behind the building. He turns his head around in all directions, then looks over at Anna. Anna notices the masked fireman watching her. She blinks, tired, then turns away, staring out into the distance, at the dark night sky. Next to her, Luke closes his eyes. The masked fireman watches Anna and Luke for another moment, then turns and LIMPS AWAY, disappearing into the darkness of the field behind the building. FADE OUT.
