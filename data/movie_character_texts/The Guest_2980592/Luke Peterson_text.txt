2) 20) dialog: Bye, mom. Spencer and Luke exit through the front door. For a long moment, Laura stands in the suddenly quiet room, staring off into space. Then she blinks and begins collecting the used dishes from the dining table.

Paper Halloween decorations line the walls, and a large orange sign at the end of the hallway reads: “SIGN UP FOR FALL DANCE - MAPLEWOOD BARN, OCTOBER 31st, HALLOWEEN NIGHT!” Luke carries his backpack slung across both shoulders, his thumbs in the straps. Up ahead, three older boys in football jerseys are laughing, two of them shoving each other. Luke lowers his head, looking at the floor as he walks forward.

13) 1) dialog: The sine is the angle of the ship’s anchor cable, so the cable is the hypotenuse, and what we need to find out is the distance down to the ocean bottom, so that’s the opposite. Do you see?
13) 3) dialog: Maybe. But it doesn’t take that much longer to just work it out for yourself. Spencer is seated in front of the television, drinking a beer. He glances over, watching David work with Luke.

INT. LAURA’S CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS Luke shuts the passenger door, glancing over at David.
16) 1) dialog: What are you doing here?
16) 4) dialog: I have lots of friends. David looks over at Luke.
16) 5) dialog: Just not, like, here. Like, online.
16) 7) dialog: Are we going?
16) 9) dialog: What are you waiting for?
16) 11) dialog: I got hit with a football.
16) 13) dialog: What are you going to do?
16) 15) dialog: Over there. David follows Luke’s gaze. A group of older students, including Mike, Ian and Jason, surround two pick-up trucks in the parking lot, one of their stereos playing loud music.
16) 17) dialog: Well, most of them give me a hard time. Those two guys, Mike and Ian, are the worst. Those guys are real assholes.
16) 19) dialog: Ian's the big one, Mike’s the guy with blond hair. David watches as one of the pick-up trucks is driven away by Jason. Mike and Ian climb into the second truck with their girlfriends.

The only other patrons are two OLDER MEN seated at the bar and a group of FOUR HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR GUYS, including Mike, Ian and Jason, who are gathered with an equal number of GIRLS their age in two booths. David looks up as Luke enters and waves him over.
18) 22) dialog: Are you, like, rich?
18) 27) dialog: Sure. Luke reaches forward and takes a small sip. He immediately sets the shot down, coughing.
18) 28) dialog: Ah! God! Luke reaches for his coke and takes several deep gulps, then sets it down. His eyes are watering.
18) 29) dialog: It's like hot peppers. You drink that?
18) 31) dialog: How do you do that?
18) 33) dialog: Uh... they look kind of annoyed. 28.

18) 37) dialog: Yeah. The guys at my school hate me.
19) 0) text: David pulls Laura’s SUV into the house’s garage, its automated door closing behind them. He and Luke climb out of the car. Luke winces, touching his head.

20) 5) dialog: Oh. Okay.

21) 4) dialog: Yeah, I’m fine. David helped me out. Anna looks over at David, seeing his bloody knuckles. Without looking at Anna, David puts his hands in his pockets.
21) 6) dialog: Some seniors were just picking on me. It happens.
21) 8) dialog: I don’t know. I’m going to my room, okay? Luke exits. Laura turns quickly to David.
38) 0) text: David and Luke sit out on the front stoop. In front of them, the two PUMPKINS have been placed on a layer of newspaper covering the concrete, along with two knives.
38) 2) dialog: First you make a hole at the top, so you can reach in and scoop all the guts out. Luke takes a steak knife and begins sawing a hole in the top of the pumpkin, with effort. David picks up a knife and starts to do the same. David then stops, examining the knife.
38) 4) dialog: Yeah. David sets down the steak knife he is holding, then removes a BUTTERFLY KNIFE from his pants pocket. Luke stares as David FLIPS the butterfly knife open. Using the gleaming blade, David easily cuts a hole in the top of his pumpkin.
38) 6) dialog: Do you carry that on you, like, all the time? 59.
38) 8) dialog: Why?
40) 3) dialog: Sure. David sets his pumpkin and the butterfly knife down on the kitchen table. He removes his jacket and tosses it onto a nearby chair in the living room. 61.
40) 5) dialog: Yeah.
40) 7) dialog: Yeah, okay.
40) 10) dialog: You’re giving this to me?
48) 3) dialog: You took a picture of David’s phone?

48) 9) dialog: Yeah?
48) 11) dialog: Yeah. I got in trouble when I told dad about it. 72.
48) 13) dialog: Do you really think David killed Craig and that other guy? Anna steers the car down the country road.
48) 15) dialog: Okay. I’1l see if I can find anything. A lot of arrest reports are public record, I’1ll check those first.

Luke sits at an empty desk and immediately takes out his netbook, opening it to an internet browser. JASON is seated behind Luke. He has a BANDAGE over his NOSE and his face is BRUISED.

49) 11) dialog: This kid called me a faggot, so I broke a yardstick on his face.

51) 0) text: David and Luke speak quietly, leaning up against a row of lockers in the deserted hallway. 78.
51) 1) dialog: So, she thinks you killed Craig. And she’s trying to make a case to the police, so they’1l let her boyfriend go.
51) 3) dialog: Yeah. David smiles, as if mildly amused.
51) 5) dialog: (shrugs) I don’t care. But that’s why she wanted me to check out that plastic surgeon in Florida. She wanted to know what the connection was there.
51) 7) dialog: To change your appearance. Like, the bones in your face. And maybe scar up your fingers so you don’t have prints. David stops smiling.
51) 8) dialog: I mean, at least that’s what I figured. I know you’re not really David Collins, I looked him up right after Anna said that. So, maybe you don’t want people to know who you are. A surgeon who would do that sort of thing is probably pretty rare. I mean, there’s probably rules against it. But that doctor, well, I guess he needs the money, so he’d do that kind of work.
51) 10) dialog: I’m not going to tell anyone about it. And no one will believe Anna. She doesn’t have anything against you. You killed dad's boss too, right? David says nothing, regarding Luke curiously. 79.
51) 11) dialog: I don’t care. I’m not going say anything.
51) 13) dialog: Because we’re friends. David blinks at Luke.
51) 14) dialog: Right?
51) 16) dialog: Okay. I just wanted you to know.
51) 18) dialog: I’m not sure. Her friend Kristen, maybe?

78) 2) dialog: What’s going on?
80) 0) text: Pulling Luke, Anna RUNS across the spinning lights of the dance floor, which is filling with FOG. They race towards the dark maze that leads to the building’s entrance, GOTH MUSIC pounding around them.
82) 2) dialog: Anna, it’s just David. I don’t know what’s going on, but he wouldn’t hurt us.
85) 4) dialog: What? No way. Look, Anna, David was probably just after that army guy. Let’s just... Let’s go talk to him.
85) 6) dialog: No, he didn’t. You’re just saying that. Luke looks at Anna. She stares back at him with tears in her eyes. Luke stops smiling. 105.

88) 6) dialog: Are you okay?

The large parking lot is filled with black SUVs and police cars with LIGHTS FLASHING. At the back of the ambulance, a PARAMEDIC shines a light into Anna's eyes, then glances over at Luke.
89) 2) dialog: Yeah. We’re fine. A volunteer FIREFIGHTER runs up to the paramedic.
91) 0) text: At the rear of the ambulance, Luke leans over and rests his head on Anna’s shoulder. Anna puts her arm around him. She looks around, surveying the activity around the smoldering building. As Anna watches, one of the masked fireman emerges from behind the building. He turns his head around in all directions, then looks over at Anna. Anna notices the masked fireman watching her. She blinks, tired, then turns away, staring out into the distance, at the dark night sky. Next to her, Luke closes his eyes. The masked fireman watches Anna and Luke for another moment, then turns and LIMPS AWAY, disappearing into the darkness of the field behind the building. FADE OUT.
