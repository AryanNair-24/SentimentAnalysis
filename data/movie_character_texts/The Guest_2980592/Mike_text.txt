7) 0) text: A BELL RINGS and students flood the school hallway, moving to their lockers and exiting the school. Paper Halloween decorations line the walls, and a large orange sign at the end of the hallway reads: “SIGN UP FOR FALL DANCE - MAPLEWOOD BARN, OCTOBER 31st, HALLOWEEN NIGHT!” Luke carries his backpack slung across both shoulders, his thumbs in the straps. Up ahead, three older boys in football jerseys are laughing, two of them shoving each other. Luke lowers his head, looking at the floor as he walks forward. One of the boys, MIKE, a senior, notices Luke slouching towards them. He glances at his friends.
7) 1) dialog: Hey, watch this. The group of seniors part to let Luke walk between them. At the last moment, Mike spins and SHOVES Luke into the wall BY HIS FACE. Luke slumps against the lockers, holding his face. Mike addresses him as they pass by.
7) 2) dialog: Fucking pussy. The other two seniors, IAN and JASON, laugh. The three boys continue down the hallway. Luke stays leaning against the wall, holding his face with both hands.
18) 0) text: Luke hesitantly opens the door to the dark bar. It is nearly empty, manned by a lone BARTENDER. David sits alone at a table, facing the back of the bar, drinking beer from a bottle. The only other patrons are two OLDER MEN seated at the bar and a group of FOUR HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR GUYS, including Mike, Ian and Jason, who are gathered with an equal number of GIRLS their age in two booths. David looks up as Luke enters and waves him over.
