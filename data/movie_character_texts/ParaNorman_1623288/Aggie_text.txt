95) 9) dialog: No! Norman reacts with horror. The "witch" cowering next to him is no more than eleven years-old. Her long hair is unkempt and dirt on her face is streaked with tears from her eyes. Her manacles have been specially made to fit her tiny wrists, and weigh her to the floor. She SNIFFS, scared and confused.
95) 11) dialog: I was only playing!
95) 17) dialog: I didn't do anything wrong! A terrible panic comes over her face.
95) 18) dialog: Stop! Leave me alone or I'll make you sorry! I'll make all of you sorry! Norman feels unsteady on his feet, the room seeming to spin around him. The faces of the townsfolk, pale and skull-like, swirl around and around, blurring together. In the center of it all, glowing like a bonfire, Aggie SCREAMS. The world turns black and Norman collapses in a faint.
102) 0) text: The headlights of the car illuminate a huge fallen trunk ahead along the path, and Perry pulls the car to a stop, wheels CRUNCHING on dirt and roots. Everyone gets out of the car. The trees around them are thick and dense. Aggie's furious storm WHISTLES through the branches far above them. Norman turns to the Dead Judge. The Judge nods solemnly, pointing ahead. Norman steels himself and begins to march forward through the thick brambles, the others following behind.
103) 0) text: Exhausted but determined, Norman finds the source of the supernatural storm; a clearing sculpted out of the forest by Aggie's fury. In the center of it all is the tree, bleached white as bone and grotesquely twisted. The trees around it CREAK and GROAN as though they'd like to uproot and plant themselves someplace else. Beneath this tree lie Aggie's remains, buried three hundred years ago. Now a mess of roots and rocks open out like an ugly wound, and within them a tiny childlike figure is barely visible through a spitting furnace of spectral energy. Ectoplasm rages up around the tree's finger-like branches like a mushroom cloud of negative energy. It's a child's tantrum turned atomic.
103) 2) dialog: You're not welcome here. Go away. Norman shivers as the voice RUMBLES coldly. The raging wind intensifies as Norman turns back around.
103) 4) dialog: Who are you?
103) 7) dialog: You're not dead.
103) 9) dialog: And you're a boy.
103) 11) dialog: You're not like me at all. Norman hesitates, knowing he's on dangerous ground.
103) 13) dialog: No you don't. You don't know anything about me.
103) 15) dialog: What?
103) 17) dialog: I don't want to go to sleep, and you can't make me! I burnt the book into dust, and now I don't have to listen to that stupid story any more! Leave me alone! Norman is terrified, but advances on the tree, the rocks under his feet churning.
103) 20) dialog: What?
103) 22) dialog: I'm not listening! LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-
103) 25) dialog: I don't like this story!
103) 27) dialog: Stop it! If Aggie weren't floating three feet above the ground, she'd be stamping her feet. Her voice blows bits of bark off the surrounding trees.
103) 30) dialog: No!
103) 32) dialog: Stop! ParaNorman 87.
103) 35) dialog: Shut up!
103) 37) dialog: I'll make you suffer!
103) 39) dialog: Because... because...
103) 41) dialog: They hurt me!
103) 43) dialog: I wanted everyone to see how rotten they were!
103) 45) dialog: No I'm not!
103) 47) dialog: No I'm not! Norman has almost reached the eye of the storm. The world behind him is a whirling torrent of burning white chaos.
103) 52) dialog: That's not true! Norman climbs up a tree root, Aggie's flames searing his skin and clothes as he gets close enough to touch her.
103) 54) dialog: Leave me alone!
103) 56) dialog: Keep away from me! Norman reaches the end of the root and jumps. His outstretched fingers shake madly as they approach Aggie's tiny hand, as though the air is fighting against him.
104) 0) text: Dappled sunlight falls through shimmering leaves and blossoms. Norman and Aggie are standing in thick grass, replete with wild flowers, the dead white tree now quite alive and blossoming behind them. Aggie is no longer an indistinct specter, but flesh and blood and as real as Norman. She stares down at her hand as Norman holds it gently by the end of her finger.
104) 1) dialog: Aggie. My name was Aggie. ParaNorman 89.
104) 3) dialog: I... I remember my mommy brought me here once. We sat under the tree and she told me stories. They all had happy endings.
104) 6) dialog: You don't?
104) 9) dialog: But what about the people who hurt you? Don't you ever want to make them suffer? Norman thinks this over, and shrugs.
104) 14) dialog: I just want my mommy...
104) 16) dialog: That story you were telling. How does it end?
104) 18) dialog: Is this where they buried me?
