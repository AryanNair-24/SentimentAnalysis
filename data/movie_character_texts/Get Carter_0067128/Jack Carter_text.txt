They show a dowdy group in some anonymous bedroom, frozen in various stages of a sexual  orgy.  GERALD FLETCHER is slumped on a sofa. His young wife, ANN is curled up beside him.  SID FLETCHER, operating the projector's remote-control,  has the same flaccid appearance as his twin brother.  Jack Carter, drink in hand, watches from an armchair.  Clunk. Another slide hits the screen. Gerald is getting  turned on. He runs his hand along his wife's stockinged  leg. Anna shudders momentarily. She obviously finds his  touch repulsive.

H leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing.
