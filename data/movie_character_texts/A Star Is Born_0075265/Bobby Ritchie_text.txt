10) 0) text: A cowboy of a man of indeterminate age, a man who's seen it all twice, who wears miles of rough road, who we'll come to know as BOBBY, barrels into the amphitheater.
10) 1) dialog: Stubborn son of a bitch.
10) 8) dialog: You gotta put ‘em in, man.
10) 10) dialog: (interrupting) The doctor said it's the only way to manage this thing, Jack. You're not gonna get back what you lost. It's the only way we can manage what you still got.
10) 12) dialog: What do you want me to do? Jack speaks into the mic, his voice echoing through the venue --
10) 14) dialog: You know what? Don't start that shit. (beat) Show a little fucking pride in what you're doing, buddy.
10) 16) dialog: Who's coming? What the fuck? 39. INT. ALLY’S HOUSE - DAY We hear opera as Ally runs down the stairs in a T-shirt and shorts.
14) 11) dialog: Hey, Jack. Killed it.
14) 13) dialog: Yeah. And during this moment between them, Ally feels the eyes of a young MAN, confident beyond his years. We’1ll come to know him as REZ. Jack pulls Ally into his trailer where a big crowd is partying. Jack puts his cowboy hat on her head where she receives an encore from Jack's band.
17) 10) dialog: (to Jack) C’mon, pal. And, used to it, Bobby perfunctorily puts a pillow under his head. Ally watches Bobby handle Jack with a surprising tenderness -- He looks at her...
17) 11) dialog: He’s out. (then; laughing at her willful naiveté) You think maybe he drinks a bit much? Sweetie, you have no idea. He starts to walk off, but turns to her --
17) 12) dialog: Tell you one thing, though. He's never brought a girl onstage before. (beat) And it's been a long, long time since he played like that.
27) 0) text: Bobby is going over a SET LIST with a TECH.
27) 1) dialog: Whenever he shows up. These guys have been vamping out there for a fucking half an hour. It's time to fucking get on. He looks up to see Jack --
27) 2) dialog: Don't you get tired of being...
27) 5) dialog: I bought that for you. (CONTINUED)
27) 9) dialog: (exploding) He washed away in a fucking storm. His grave isn't there anymore. I would have told you, but you were fucking drunk. You were fucking loaded and already pissing yourself a swan song. Fuck if you shed a tear for that piece of shit you idolize for no goddamn fucking reason. All Dad ever did for you... is make you his fucking drinking buddy. And you'd be right there with him if he was still alive, and you fucking know it. Ally looks at Jack, his head down, thinking god knows what... But Bobby grabs Jack’s face, pulling him close, nose-to-nose, nowhere to hide.
27) 10) dialog: What did you think, that I was gonna fucking take care of it while I'm fucking cradling your ass all over the goddamn world?
27) 12) dialog: If I was no good, why'd you steal my fucking voice?
27) 14) dialog: (after a beat) Well, I got something to say now, pal. I'm done being your fucking errand boy. I quit. And Bobby’s gone. Jack opens the door to the dressing room... 60.
49) 19) dialog: I'm in town for a gig. Been working for Willie. (Jack can’t hear) I've been working for Willie.
49) 21) dialog: Yeah. Thought I'd stop by and check her out.
49) 24) dialog: (re: Jack's hearing) Is it getting worse?
49) 26) dialog: I gotta say, it's easier without you. Jack nods. They regard each other and the audience erupts at the end of her song... (CONTINUED)
49) 30) dialog: Listen. You run into any trouble... call me. Jack turns, Ally and the entire horde of people are being ushered past... Jack begins to walk in her direction, disappearing into the onslaught.
56) 0) text: Bobby and 103.
56) 17) dialog: They hired this fucking kid at the last minute. They didn't tell me a fucking thing. (beat) Look, we've been on that other side before. More than once. Jack lets that sink in...
56) 19) dialog: Truth is, I didn't deliver. Jack looks up to his big brother. What’s there to say?
56) 21) dialog: You're gonna do it?
63) 65) dialog: I think if we had a better band name, we might've made it. Or maybe it was because we looked like a father and son duo. Not many of those around. Jack laughs. (CONTINUED)
63) 69) dialog: Not my fault I couldn't find a better guitar player in the whole goddamn state. They share a small laugh... Then, after a beat...
63) 70) dialog: Where in the fuck is it?
63) 72) dialog: Sure thing, Jack. Jack starts to get out of the truck, but stops short...
67) 4) dialog: Some kid started singing one of his songs in a bar I was in the other night... They're playing his songs everywhere. He thinks about it... (CONTINUED)
67) 7) dialog: At first I got angry. I don't know why. I guess I felt like... how can any of these people feel like they knew him? Who he really was. (beat) But then something changed. And it soothed me. That, well, it wasn't all for fucking nothing. She looks at him.
67) 9) dialog: Listen to me. It isn't your fault. It just isn't. You know whose fault it was? Jack. That's it. No one else. Not you, not me. No one but Jack.
67) 11) dialog: Jack talked about how music is essentially twelve notes between any octave. Twelve notes and the octave repeats. It's the same story. Told over and over. Forever. All any artist can offer the world is how they see those twelve notes. That's it. Ally looks at him, hearing him.
68) 1) dialog: (post-lap) He loved how you see them. He just kept saying, ‘I love how she sees ‘em, Bobby.’ (CONTINUED)
