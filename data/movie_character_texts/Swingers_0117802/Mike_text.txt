The pool of golden light disintegrates into the thousands points which constitute it as we rapidly draw closer to t city. We are just above the tops of the highest buildings as we approach Hollywood Boulevard.  Below is neon and the icy thrust of search lights rotating on the corner of Hollywo and Vine. We continue west, then quickly north. There is the momentary appearance of the moonlit HOLLYWOO sign as we pass the blinking red beacon of the Capital Records building and drop into Franklin avenue and over t 101. Architectural remnants of Hollywood's past whip up.  We a heading east at treetop level.  A warm glow in the distan quickly grows into a modest commercial strip which includ cafes, bookstores, and a theater. We drop to eye level as we spy through the plate glass showcase window of the "Bourgeois Pig" coffeehouse, which holds the translucent reflection of the full moon. A cigarette wedged between knuckles smoulders.  MIKE take the last drag with great effort, then crushes it out.  He sits in the window sprawled across a red velvet couch tha once perfectly complemented a faux spanish foyer.

1) 4) dialog: But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
1) 6) dialog: So I don't call either way.
1) 8) dialog: So what's the difference?
1) 10) dialog: So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
1) 12) dialog: Well that sucks.
1) 14) dialog: So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
1) 16) dialog: Right...  Wait, what do you mean?
1) 18) dialog: Unless she comes back first.

2) 39) dialog: We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about.  But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck.  I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to.  And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack.  Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes.  I'm not gonna be one of those assholes.  It's fucking depressing.  Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me?  It makes me want to puke.

2) 54) dialog: Wait.
2) 56) dialog: What are you wearing?  I mean, we should wear suits.
2) 58) dialog: No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
2) 60) dialog: Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
3) 0) text: Mike is dressed to the nines in classic vintage threads. He's trying to look at ease as he straightens his cuff li He approaches Trent who suavely leans against his worn do ride.  He's a tall, slim, good-looking cat.  His sharkski suit hangs well on his lanky frame as it tapers to his ankles.  Sinatra's "Come Fly With Me" on the tape deck ad an elegance to the scene.  They exchange an impish grin a depart without saying a word.  Maybe this isn't such a ba idea.
6) 1) dialog: (counting bills) I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one.  I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night.  You gotta be cool though.

9) 4) text: Trent points out a mountain range.  It is now the only th separating them from their destination.  The surreal glow the desert sky is accentuated by the loud slashing of the cobalt and ruby lasers emanating from a source masked by the craggy peaks.  Mike slowly stirs from his slumber.  H transfixed by this affrontation of nature.  It is his fir glimpse of the city without God.
9) 5) dialog: (in reverie) Vegas.
10) 0) text: The shrill cry of Basie's fat brass section heralds the arrival of the young swingers.  Their eyes drink every wa of golden light as Sinatra's crooning urges them on. Mike has either had enough sleep or so little that it no longer matters.  Either way, there's no turning back. They roll up to a casino valet.  TILT UP to a skull and crossbones which looms overhead.
11) 1) dialog: (the first budding of crankiness) Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
11) 3) dialog: This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
11) 6) dialog: This place is dead.  I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
11) 8) dialog: They're all skanks.
11) 10) dialog: Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six.  This is the skank shift.

11) 21) dialog: You're gonna screw up our plan.
11) 23) dialog: First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
11) 25) dialog: Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
11) 27) dialog: The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
11) 29) text: Mike points to a semi-curtained, semi-roped-off area near baccarat tables.  The clientele is classier, but they're still obviously overdressed.

11) 32) dialog: Oh, they're watching all right.  They're watching.

12) 13) dialog: Huh?
12) 15) dialog: Sure, that'll be fine.
12) 16) text: The dealer chirps out an unintelligible formality and the BOSS chirps the response.  Trent's focus whips away from camera as both he and Mike stare at the pit boss ten feet away. The dealer plunks down the measly THREE CHIPS which repre Mike's entire cash reserve.  Not quite the effect he had hoped for. The swingers stare at the chips.  The players stare at th swingers.  The dealer stares at the pit boss.
12) 17) dialog: Do you have anything smaller?
12) 21) text: Trent looks over to see that it's the same WAITRESS who flashed him a smile earlier.

12) 22) dialog: (to the waitress, but never breaking eye contact with the dealer) I'll have a vodka martini, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry.
12) 26) dialog: (regaining composure) No.  Blacks will be fine.
12) 27) text: Mike throws a chip in the circle.  Trent is shocked.  Tha a hundred bucks.  Mike and Trent share a look.  The deale and the pit boss exchange glances.  Bets are all down and cards are meticulously dealt. The dealer has a two showing.  Mike has been dealt a five a six- eleven.
12) 29) dialog: (even husheder) What?!?
12) 31) dialog: I know, but...
12) 33) dialog: ...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
12) 36) dialog: I know.
12) 38) dialog: (with all the nonchalance he can muster) Double down.
12) 39) text: A bead of sweat. The sharp snap of a dealt card. It's a seven.  Eighteen. Disappointment twists their faces. Finally the dealer flips over his card. It's a king!  Twelve.  Here comes the bust... Flick - four.  Sixteen!  Here comes the bust... Flick - five.  Twenty one.  Groans all around, except for swingers who watch their chips slide away in silence. Mike breaks the spell with a plucky smile from the pit of stomach.
12) 40) dialog: (to the pit boss) Sure could use some dinner about now.
12) 43) dialog: Yeah?  Well obviously not always!

13) 8) dialog: Yea, how much?
13) 10) dialog: Don't give me that shit.  You know exactly how much you lost.  What'd you drop?
13) 12) dialog: You won.  There's nothing to be sorry about.  You're a winner.  I'm the fuckin loser.  I should be sorry.
13) 14) dialog: Let's just leave.
13) 16) dialog: Let's go.
13) 18) text: Mike looks away, shaking his head in disgust.
13) 20) dialog: (shaking his head to hide a smirk) What an asshole.
13) 24) dialog: Sorry.  We got knocked out pretty quickly.
13) 26) dialog: Could you believe it?
13) 28) dialog: Nah, I didn't really want it anyway.  I just wanted to order it.
13) 30) dialog: No thanks.  Why ruin a perfect night.
13) 33) dialog: What an asshole.
13) 35) dialog: That was so demeaning...

13) 39) dialog: She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
13) 41) dialog: Let's go.  I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.

13) 45) dialog: I don't think so.
13) 47) dialog: You think so?
13) 49) dialog: I'm too tired for this.  Let's just go.
13) 51) dialog: She likes you.
13) 53) dialog: I don't know...
13) 55) dialog: That's bullshit.
13) 57) dialog: It's just that I've been out of the game so long.  Trent, I was with her for six years.  That's before AIDS.  I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
13) 59) dialog: It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
13) 61) dialog: ... and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
13) 68) text: Mike can't believe it.  Tee is just making it happen.
14) 0) text: Trent and Mike are looking at menus.  They're smoking at table because the can.

14) 5) dialog: I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
14) 9) dialog: Coffee... (points to Trent, who nods) Two coffees.  It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
14) 11) dialog: I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
14) 18) dialog: I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
14) 20) dialog: (disgusted with himself) "Age of Enlightenment".  Shit.  Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference.  How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
14) 22) dialog: ... It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
14) 24) dialog: I hope so. (checks watch) We gotta go soon.
14) 26) dialog: We didn't do so bad after all.
14) 28) text: Mike tries to catch the attention of their waitress, who passing with a huge platter containing a BREAKFAST BANQUE
14) 29) dialog: Excuse me.  We're in a bit of a hurry.
15) 4) dialog: I'm Mike... (with contempt) and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
15) 8) dialog: Whatever.
15) 13) dialog: Well... we're not in Kansas anymore.
15) 16) dialog: I'm a comedian.
15) 19) dialog: No...
15) 21) dialog: Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
15) 23) dialog: There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
15) 25) dialog: (flustered) Oh?  You know about booking agents...  I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
15) 27) dialog: Actually, it's funny you...  I'm actually, uh, between...

17) 6) dialog: "Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
17) 8) dialog: No!
17) 13) dialog: No!  Not the camera guy!
17) 17) dialog: ... So give me the fuckin part...

25) 3) dialog: Sorry about interrupting...
25) 5) dialog: Christy was nice...
25) 7) dialog: She was hot.
25) 9) dialog: I don't know.  The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on.  Does that makes me some kind of fag?
25) 11) dialog: She didn't like me, anyway.
25) 13) dialog: I don't think so.
25) 15) dialog: Yeah, a good friend.
25) 17) dialog: I just don't think she liked me in that way.
25) 19) dialog: Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
25) 21) dialog: That was different.
25) 23) dialog: I was younger... It was college.  You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like.  You screw chicks you have no business being with.  They're young, they don't know any better.

25) 29) dialog: ... a day...

25) 37) dialog: I hear she's getting real fat.
25) 39) text: Trent cranks some Frank.  "You Make Me Feel So Young". Mike is finally, genuinely, smiling. He turns down the music enough to talk.

26) 4) dialog: I's a gig.
26) 6) dialog: You're an actor.  Find the Zen in the role.

27) 9) dialog: I didn't mention her once today.
27) 11) text: Mike pulls out the flag for Rob's putt.  He misses.

27) 28) dialog: I don't know.  Eight or Nine.

27) 32) dialog: Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole.  This is turning into quite a rivalry.
28) 3) text: MIKE looks on.  He is more captivated with the simulated sporting event than the Clippers game on the TV across th room. Electric guitars blaze over the stereo. The room, like the guys, could use a spring cleaning.  Pi boxes, beer bottles, and full, full ashtrays.  You can ta the smoke.
28) 5) dialog: Hey Sue.  Gretsky's on his ass again.
28) 8) dialog: You should play another team.  The Kings are bitches in this game.
28) 14) dialog: Give it up, Sue.
28) 17) text: Mike picks up the phone off the matted shag carpet.  He pushes "9", listens, then hangs up.
28) 19) dialog: This version doesn't have fighting?
28) 21) dialog: What?  That was the best part of the old game.
28) 25) dialog: No.
28) 28) dialog: Make someone bleed.
28) 33) dialog: Give me the money.  I'll get it.
28) 34) text: While Sue gives Mike the money, Trent UNPAUSES the game a checks Gretsky into the boards, leaving him writhing in a pool of red pixels.
28) 36) text: Sue dives onto Trent.  They wrestle a little too rambunctiously for indoors.  Trent pulls the hockey sweat over Sue's head and starts wailing on his back. Mike crosses.  The CAMERA follows him down a shallow hall to the door.  He unlocks it. A delivery man of eastern-hemispheric decent is out of br from four flights of stairs.  He hands Mike a twelve-pack Bud cans and three packs of Marlboro reds. He can HEAR, but NOT SEE, the chaos ensuing in the living room.
29) 0) text: Trent and Sue are flushed.  They pause long enough to tor Mike.
30) 0) text: Mike forces an apologetic smile.  He is embarrassed.  The delivery man doesn't seem to understand any of this. Mike, out of guilt, hands him a four dollar tip.  This he seems to understand.  He smiles and leaves. Mike crosses back to the main room.
30) 1) dialog: You guys are such assholes.
30) 4) text: Mike throws him a pack of smokes, which he unravels with surgical precision. Cans of beer are tossed around and cracked.

30) 10) dialog: I'm gonna bring and old friend who just moved out here.

31) 0) text: MIKE and ROB walk down the dirty deserted alleyway.  Mike wearing baggy slacks, Doc Martin shoes, and an oversized Eisenhower-cut jacket with a vertical stripe inset.  The collar is large and pointy, but definitely not seventies. His ensemble has more of an early sixties vibe. Rob hasn't been at it quite as long.  He's wearing worn-i Levies over worn-in boots and, the nineties standby, an untucked flannel. Mike walks with purpose.  He intermittently tries to pull open locked steel doors along the alley.  Rob looks confu
31) 2) dialog: To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
31) 4) dialog: (pulling handle) It's one of these.  For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
31) 6) dialog: (pull) It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing.  It's kinda cool.  It's like you're in on some kind of secret.  You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it.  The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there.  You have to have someone come before.  There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons.  It's kinda like Judaism...
31) 8) dialog: ... That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
31) 9) text: At this point they come upon an unmarked BLACK METAL DOOR which Mike successfully pulls open to reveal...
32) 0) text: A smoke-filled, windowless, black-walled room.  There are several round padded booths lining the walls.  The place packed, and the funk standard "Brick House" throbs over t P.A..

Enshrined in its center a framed photograph of SINATRA smiling in approval as he presides over the evening's activities. Mike proudly points out the photo to Rob.
32) 1) dialog: Kinda money, huh?
32) 3) text: Mike catches the attention of a cute female BARTENDER.
32) 4) dialog: I'll get a Dewars rocks... (looks to Rob)
32) 6) dialog: ...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please.
