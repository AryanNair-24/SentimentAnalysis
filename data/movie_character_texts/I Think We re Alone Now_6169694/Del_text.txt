Four beaming, airbrushed faces in a framed photograph on mantelpiece. Father, mother, two-point-five kids. The glass on the frame is just barely frosted over. ANGLE on the FRONT DOOR. From outside: A pair of muted FOOTSTEPS. The adjacent window QUIVERS as a small SCREWDRIVER slides underneath the sill. It’s a tight fit.

He scuffs his boots on the floor mat. Surveys the room. His eyes land on the ticking wall clock. He plucks the cl from its moorings. Removes the batteries. The ticking sound abruptly dies. He re-hangs the clock. Straightens it. He deposits the batteries in a zip-lock bag. Folds the ba into the front pocket of a worn Kipling backpack. Swings backpack over his shoulder. The ape keychain dangles at Del’s side, open-mouthed in a state of perpetual awe.

39) 32) dialog: Don’t look at me. I’m just fleshing out your repopulation theory to its logical extreme.
39) 36) dialog: Great. So that’s forty-two of our children that are then obligated to breed with their siblings to further procreate. And due to the heightened risk of developmental disabilities in inbred children, our descendants would have a severely diminished capacity for survival and would likely die out within a matter of one or two generations, max.

The DVDs, I mean. Drop them off in the return slot when you're finished. (a pause) Do you like comedies?
44) 26) dialog: We've got a whole section that’s just comedy films. And not just the mainstream stuff either. Some of the titles have been out of print for-- well, I guess they’re all out of print now, technically. 32.
44) 28) dialog: I do. At the moment, your leaving here and never ever coming back is a very exciting prospect for me.
44) 30) dialog: But if I’m forced to think about it long-term, I‘1l admit there’s a very slim possibility that there could come a day when I change my mind and decide that I could do with some company after all. But by that point you’d be long gone and it'd be virtually impossible for me to ever find you again.
44) 32) dialog: There’s a terrifying degree of permanency there, don’t you think?

48) 9) dialog: How do I explain this? Okay. In thermodynamics, there's a term called entropy. It’s understood as a measure of disorder, the capacity for randomness in a given system.
48) 11) dialog: But have you ever considered its implications? The more entropy in a system, the more potential for chaos. Variables upon variables. Endlessly unpredictable outcomes. But when you reduce the amount of entropy in a system... He strings up the bag with a tight knot.
48) 12) dialog: You can control for error. With every piece of trash we pick up, that’s one less force for disorder in the universe. 37. He hands Grace the bag. Procures another.
48) 13) dialog: Now imagine a system with no disorder whatsoever. In theory you could predict, with stunning accuracy, most everything that will ever happen within that system.
48) 15) dialog: It’s exactly a vacuum. And so long as we’re committed to serving as agents of order rather than chaos, it stays that way.
