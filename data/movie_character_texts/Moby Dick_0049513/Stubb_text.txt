Ishmael backs up against the window to steer clear. Stubb and his prostitutes bustle off into the stormy night. Ishmael considers the tavern and digs out a few meager coins from his pocket. Someone distracts him: Crazy, old Elijah eyeballs him from across the street. Ishmael reacts and protectively pockets his coins. He moves on. A short distance further, another tavern with a sign overhead, swinging in the wind: "THE SPOUTER-INN, PETER COFFIN, PROPRIETOR". Ishmael glances through the window.

Up three steps and down, around a corner and over another set of steps, passing dim-lit doors. Coffin walks fast, I struggling to keep up. As they pass one door... A giggling, half-naked girl (one of Stubb's Doxies) spills out. Stubb yanks her back inside, slams the door. Ishmael pauses to look back, puzzling over their MUFFLED Coffin glances back with a chortle.

As soon as the platter is on the table, the sharp spear of a harpoon stabs a fat cut of bloody red meat. Queequeg transfers the steak to his plate with quiet ceremony, the entire maneuver performed with exquisite ge and good manners. Setting aside his harpoon on the floor, he digs in. Ishmael watches him, baffled. The rest of the men don't seem to have noticed anything unusual. They reach for meat and bread, far less politely, and noisily chow down. A brown and brawny bunch, Stubb and Flask among them. Ishmael glances behind him:
17) 1) text: BULKINGTON, a handsome, stalwart seaman with a quiet reserve, sits at another table with his young, pretty FIANCEE. They talk in low voices, holding hands. Ishmael turns back...the platter of steaks is almost empty. He takes the last cut, a small, overcooked portion. Studies it with resignation. He's about to cut into it, when his steak is removed by Sal... She grins and presents him with a whole new platter piled high with fine, rare slices. Stubb and Flask chuckle at Ishmael. Sal gives them a stern look.

They collect to on the promontory, all eyes cast seaward to catch a last glimpse of their husbands' dwindling ship. Among them is Starbuck's Wife, a face of sad remorse. Stubb's two Doxies, gushing tears. Ahab's grieving Wife, who has no more tears left to cry. All bear the look of women who have become widows in their men's lifetimes. Standing alone, Bulkington's Fiancee gazes forlornly out, hugging herself with anxious dread. Starbuck's Wife approaches and lays a comforting arm around her. From their view, the Pequod shrinks into the horizon.

36) 1) dialog: One hand for the ship, Mister Ishmael, one hand for yerself! Ishmael rises to his feet, nods his thanks to Queequeg, h but keeping his pride. To Stubb:
36) 3) dialog: Aye, but you're wrong! It's laughter that's the final consequence of everything! The only comfort a man has, 33. and the wisest one!
36) 5) dialog: The ONLY comfort, shipmate, and the wisest, I tell you! Wise Stubb, that's what they call me -- and that's because, whatever happens, I go to it laughing! Another bellowing laugh. Ishmael nods, accepting that. Flask joins Flask picks them, hard-eying Ishmael as he faces Stubb.

38) 24) dialog: No medicine for you, Flask! Let's christen our new pup... (to Ishmael) Come here, me boy! This'1ll cure ye... Ishmael turns, gingerly holding his bowl. Stubb pours rum over his bandaged hands. Ishmael drops the bowl -- screams in pain! Stubb pushes the bottle at him. STUBB (cont'd) Quick! Drink, lad, it'll kill the pain... Agonizing, Ishmael grabs the bottle with hot hands and takes a quick, deep swig. He spits out a mouthful and gasps, his insides burning worse than his hands. STUBB (cont'd) Go on -- take another! Ye may be dry for a long spell to come! Looking around at the mates GOADING him on, Ishmael takes the challenge. He chugalugs from the bottle.
38) 26) dialog: Well done, sailor! Ishmael can't speak, his breath on fire, sinking faintly on a bench. Queequeg pounds his back to revive him. The others eye the bottle, anxious for a taste. Their grubby hands grope for it, but Flask pushes them back. 39.
38) 28) dialog: Hist! Cut your seizings! The crew falls silent, eyes on the swaying ceiling. The RHYTHMIC THUNK-CLOP of a pacing peg leg on deck. Then it stops. A long, quiet beat between the men. Stubb turns to Ishmael, in a low voice: STUBB (cont'd) He lost that leg to a whale, is what I heard. Devoured, it was! Chewed up by the most monstrous fish that ever chipped a boat!
38) 30) dialog: Well, no whale's ever happy to be hunted. I wouldn't want any man in my boat who ain't afraid of ‘em.

38) 44) dialog: Why, sharks are so a-feared of 'em, they dash themselves into rocks just to flee a whale's wake! Drunken Ishmael listens with wide-eyed terror. Pip dances around the quarters, breaking the tension.

Stubb grins at a hung-over Ishmael, shouting close: STUBB (cont'd) You're on morning lookout, sailor! Get aloft! Ishmael grimaces. Nursing sore hands, he looks up apprehe at the towering masthead. Queequeg steps between them.
41) 4) dialog: Nay, every man takes his turn. He whacks Ishmael's aching back, a quick laugh. STUBB (cont'd) This mother's boy has got to earn his salt! Hop to it!

Three boats lower fast, chains CLANKING, ropes HISSING, and splash onto the water. A clamor of SHOUTS, rowers, ha and the three mates scrambling down ladders, into their respective boats. A fourth spare boat is lowered by Fedallah's crew, aloof from the others, working silently and efficiently. In Starbuck's boat, Ishmael mans the oars with others, br with anticipation of his first whale hunt. Queequeg attaches rope lines to his harpoons. The boat casts away from the ship. Stubb cries out from his boat, as they too cast off.

Stubb and Tashtego climb aboard and shoot dagger looks at the Arab, a mix of admiration and resentment. Fe casually picks his teeth with a tapering, knife-long fingernail. They help aboard Ishmael...wet, shivering, in shock. Then come Starbuck and Queequeg, both soaked to the bone but composed as if nothing had happened.
102) 2) dialog: Aye! What manner of creature is he, anyway?
102) 6) dialog: Man's the devil, all right! The reason ye can't see his tail is because he tucks it out of sight!

104) 1) dialog: A steak, a steak, by heaven, before I sleep! They make their way toward the ship's side to which the carcass is lashed. All the men look down at the hump of the whale's immense forehead. Fedallah silently drifts past them. Startled by him, Stubb turns to the others with a look of scorn.
104) 2) dialog: Ah, now wait, shipmates... wait! Ain't this the devil that killed the whale?
104) 3) text: He bows mockingly to Fedallah, who returns a skeletal grin. STUBB (cont'd) The harpooner's choice of steak, eh? Is that what ye came for? Ignoring him, Fedallah spits down at the carcass of the whale with pure contempt. Tauntingly, he steps up to the gold coin on the mast and taps it, as if it were already his. Then returns to his crew in the spare boat. Stubb laughs and leans over the bulwark. He takes the harpoon-lamp from the Carpenter and shines it down on the ferocious scene below: sharks in a feeding frenzy, ripping at the dead whale.
104) 4) dialog: Well, that foreign devil may care not for whale steaks, but I'll eat this fish in one mouthful! (to harpooners) Ready, boys... Stubb throws the harpoon-lamp -- impaling it into the whale's forehead. Queequeg, Dagoo and Tashtego leap over the side.
106) 1) dialog: Just the tender bits, boys!
109) 0) text: The harpooners have returned, the others all huddled around something. Stubb pushes his way in between them, as we move in to reveal: five whale steaks, sizzling on a rudimentary grill.

The two officers dig into their steaks with relish, Stubb leaning over in a low voice: STUBB (cont'd) Poor Capt'n. The whale eats him, 'stead of him eatin' the whale. Flask listens to the shark's savagings, annoyed.
118) 0) text: Viewed from our deck: the happy, drunken Enderby crew crowd the bulwarks, facing us. They wave flasks of grog, SHOUTING across and gesturing us to join them. Scanning across the faces of our crewmen, we see the eager anticipation of licking lips and ogling eyes. Ishmael gawks at the LAUGHING native girls, their voices like sweet music. Queequeg nods knowingly to himself, a nostalgic look. Sunning in the whaleboat, only Fedellah's crew shows no interest. Flask turns to Stubb, unable to take his eyes off the girls.
118) 2) dialog: Aye. Those crack fellows have done well for themselves. Starbuck smiles at the men. Beside him, Ahab sees and hears nothing but the ENDERBY CAPTAIN climbing up the ship's side with his ESCORTS. Starbuck turns to Ahab.

120) 3) dialog: Agh, I've seen worse. Better to sail with a moody good captain than a merry bad one. Pip sits on a capstan with his untouched tambourine, watching the ill mood around him. Perth and Dough-Boy swab the deck, SQUABBLING AD-LIB with each other in low, angry voices.
122) 1) text: Perth dumps a swab bucket and splashes Dough-Boy. A fight quickly breaks out! Perth pulls a knife -- until Stubb grabs his wrist and yanks it away.

At night, to boot! If I had only one leg, ye wouldn't catch ME in a boat by night... unless maybe to stop a leak with a whalebone toe!

193) 2) dialog: Well, this is a fine day! We'd given him up for lost!
193) 4) dialog: By jimminy! You're a credit to us all! Ishmael smiles proudly, as men give him and Queequeg hearty pats. The two trade grins of brotherly kinship. They step over to Pip. Everyone gathers round the boy, as Tashtego pushes the tambourine into Pip's hands.

The Blacksmith dumps in a bucket of whale oil to fuel the tri-works' blaze. Bundled in winter coats and scarves, Stubb, Flask and others huddle close to the warmth of its open hearth. Ishmael paces nearby to ward off the cold. Starbuck steps over to watch the Blacksmith dip his bucket into an open oil cask.

The ship seems at first glance deserted, but there are seamen about... Dough-Boy, aloft in the lookout. Dagoo and Tashtego squat on the bow gunwale, harpoons in hand, eyes fixed on the horizon with warrior-like intensity. Stubb cons the ship on the wheeldeck, puffing his pipe. Flask at the helm. Both gaze steadily seaward with fanatical concentration. Fedallah and his crew straddle yard arms, staring uniformly out to sea. Zealous sentinels, watching and waiting. Not a sound from anyone. No talking, no laughter, not even from Stubb. All are focused on whatever is out there. All with one singular purpose.
