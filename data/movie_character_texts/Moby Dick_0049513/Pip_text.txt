The tall figure enters and leans his immense harpoon gently against a wall, as if it were delicate china. He lights a small candle on a dresser. A dark-skinned Polynesian, Queequeg's clean-shaved face is covered with strange, exotic tattoos. His face is ferocious-looking and yet tranquil, almost innocent in ch He pulls a satchel off his shoulder, opens it and takes out what vaguely resembles a doll's head. Obscure in the dim light, Ishmael watches in awe. It's a shrunken human head. Queequeg lifts it up to the candlelight and chants some indecipherable words to it. Ishmael stares warily from his covers. Queequeg abruptly stops his invocation, stuffs the head back into his satchel and moves the candle to the bedside table. He quickly undresses. Ishmael can't take his eyes off the muscular, tattooed body -- as Queequeg leaps into the bed beside him. Still unaware of Ishmael's presence, Queequeg produces a long tomahawk pipe, leans toward the candle, lights the pipe and sits back in bed, puffing serenely. He rests his free hand down next to him...directly onto I face. Ishmael stiffens with fear. Queequeg freezes. Ishmael tries to jump out of bed -- but Queequeg grabs him by his nightshirt collar and firmly holds him down. He deftly wields his tomahawk, its blade against Ishmael's throat.

An old, grizzled SHIP'S COOK watches, as DOCKHANDS carry food stores and water barrels on deck. By his side is PIP (12), a black cabin boy of small stature with a playful face. Merry as a cricket and bright as a cherub. He toys with a tambourine as he watches the bustle of activity. A cheerful presence, clearly appreciated by the men at work. Overseeing the loading operation from an old wicker chair by the gangplank is a heavy-set, retired captain, PELEG, dressed in the Quaker style. He watches with sharp care at every passing item, writing them down on a thick ledger. The SOUND of Queequeg's powerful CHANTING VOICE wafts over the dock. SHIP'S CREWMEN steal glances at the curious duo down below, as they approach.

60) 0) text: Ishmael emerges from below and breathes in the sea air. He looks toward Fedallah and his strange crew: setting up camp in a spare whaleboat. Bedding and food have been laid out, as if they were on a different ship from the rest of the crew. They converse in low, guttural ARABIC. Ishmael turns to the side for solitude, gazing over the moonlit sea. Then realizes he's not alone... Ahab stands some yards away by the bulwark, also gazing out. He produces a pipe and lights it, cupping the bowl with bony hands. A ship's lamp casts a flickering light across his weathered visage. Ishmael retreats a step into shadow, afraid of the man, yet fascinated by him. 59. Unaware of him, Ahab smokes in silence. He takes the pipe from his mouth and stares at it, shaking his head. His voice unusually subdued:

He makes his way to his bunk. to discern another distant SOUND beyond the hull: An eerie, haunting, watery MELODY from deep in the ocean, away. Pip is awake on his bunk, ears close to the hull, as he listens to the mysterious SOUND. Ishmael crouches beside him, fondly watching the boy. Their eyes meet.
63) 2) dialog: Whales, sir. They're singin' to each other. Pip smiles in the dim light. Ishmael returns the smile and retires into his own bunk, listening too. WHALE SONGS seem to fill the forecastle's cramped space.

Stubb and Tashtego climb aboard and shoot dagger looks at the Arab, a mix of admiration and resentment. Fe casually picks his teeth with a tapering, knife-long fingernail. They help aboard Ishmael...wet, shivering, in shock. Then come Starbuck and Queequeg, both soaked to the bone but composed as if nothing had happened.

164) 2) text: The whale's spout gushes spasmodically. The air fills with bloody mist, spraying the whalers red as they row frantically away from the sea beast's death throes. 93 The whale starts to dive. Harpoon lines spin out of the loggerhead basket -- rolls of line uncoil rapidly, the basket shaking violently! Unnoticed by the others, frightened Pip scrambles out from beneath the box plank and stumbles into the basket -- his little legs tangled in spinning lines! Queequeg lets loose a WAR CRY at the fast-receding whale. Ishmael jumps to his feet, straining to get a look... A QUICK, TINY SCREAM startles him from behind! Pip suddenly squirts out past him, dragged by a line and yanked overboard -- into the churning water!

His head jerks around with a moan of despair... A shark's fin streaks through the water with lethal swiftness, circling around him. Pip bobs frantically, gasping with terror, wide eyes fixed on the approaching predator. The shark fin disappears under. Instinctively, Pip dives.

201) 0) text: The crew swabs the deck clean. None of them notice Pip, who scrambles out of the whaleboat and makes a beeline for the main mast. He stares dourly at the shiny gold coin nailed to the wood. A whispery singsong voice:

245) 0) text: Deserted, quiet. The door creeps open. Pip ventures in, HUMMING some mad melody. Wandering through Ahab's forbidden domain, he comes upon a large carved box and opens it: scrimshaw chess pieces, an ivory chess board. Pip runs his hands over exquisitely carved whale pieces. He spills the contents onto the floor. Kneeling down, he carefully selects the black king and places it on the board. Looks around the cabin, searching for something. He jumps up and snatches up a whale-tooth paperweight. Pip plops back on the floor and places the tooth on the board...the white whale...directly in front of the black king. He leans back and seriously studies the board, HUMMING AWAY. Then jumps up and browses around... Two spare whale-bone peg legs protrude from an open sea chest. Pip touches them with a strange reverence. An arctic breeze wafts in from the window and knocks Ahab's top hat off a clothes rack full of black coats. The hat rolls along the floor...stopping before Pip.

278) 0) text: Pip sleeps on the floor amidst a flotsam of chess pieces, curled up peacefully at Ahab's feet like a napping pup.

304) 0) text: A deathly quiet reigns over the deck, like a ghost ship. Broken spars and scattered rigging from the storm lie about, unattended to. The ship seems at first glance deserted, but there are seamen about... Dough-Boy, aloft in the lookout. Dagoo and Tashtego squat on the bow gunwale, harpoons in hand, eyes fixed on the horizon with warrior-like intensity. Stubb cons the ship on the wheeldeck, puffing his pipe. Flask at the helm. Both gaze steadily seaward with fanatical concentration. Fedallah and his crew straddle yard arms, staring uniformly out to sea. Zealous sentinels, watching and waiting. Not a sound from anyone. No talking, no laughter, not even from Stubb. All are focused on whatever is out there. All with one singular purpose.
