The tall figure enters and leans his immense harpoon gently against a wall, as if it were delicate china. He lights a small candle on a dresser. A dark-skinned Polynesian, Queequeg's clean-shaved face is covered with strange, exotic tattoos. His face is ferocious-looking and yet tranquil, almost innocent in ch He pulls a satchel off his shoulder, opens it and takes out what vaguely resembles a doll's head. Obscure in the dim light, Ishmael watches in awe. It's a shrunken human head. Queequeg lifts it up to the candlelight and chants some indecipherable words to it. Ishmael stares warily from his covers. Queequeg abruptly stops his invocation, stuffs the head back into his satchel and moves the candle to the bedside table. He quickly undresses. Ishmael can't take his eyes off the muscular, tattooed body -- as Queequeg leaps into the bed beside him. Still unaware of Ishmael's presence, Queequeg produces a long tomahawk pipe, leans toward the candle, lights the pipe and sits back in bed, puffing serenely. He rests his free hand down next to him...directly onto I face. Ishmael stiffens with fear. Queequeg freezes. Ishmael tries to jump out of bed -- but Queequeg grabs him by his nightshirt collar and firmly holds him down. He deftly wields his tomahawk, its blade against Ishmael's throat.

As soon as the platter is on the table, the sharp spear of a harpoon stabs a fat cut of bloody red meat. Queequeg transfers the steak to his plate with quiet ceremony, the entire maneuver performed with exquisite ge and good manners. Setting aside his harpoon on the floor, he digs in. Ishmael watches him, baffled. The rest of the men don't seem to have noticed anything unusual. They reach for meat and bread, far less politely, and noisily chow down. A brown and brawny bunch, Stubb and Flask among them. Ishmael glances behind him:

18) 16) dialog: Yojo sabbee. Ishmael pick ship. He takes over the wheelbarrow and pushes on. Ishmael catches up with him, and the two stride together toward the port.

20) 0) text: A short, bent SHIP'S CARPENTER with a wrinkled face oversees the loading of lumber. His body is wracked with arthritis, but for his powerful arms and hands. An old, grizzled SHIP'S COOK watches, as DOCKHANDS carry food stores and water barrels on deck. By his side is PIP (12), a black cabin boy of small stature with a playful face. Merry as a cricket and bright as a cherub. He toys with a tambourine as he watches the bustle of activity. A cheerful presence, clearly appreciated by the men at work. Overseeing the loading operation from an old wicker chair by the gangplank is a heavy-set, retired captain, PELEG, dressed in the Quaker style. He watches with sharp care at every passing item, writing them down on a thick ledger. The SOUND of Queequeg's powerful CHANTING VOICE wafts over the dock. SHIP'S CREWMEN steal glances at the curious duo down below, as they approach.

An Olympic throw across the deck -- past Bildad's nose, over the Cook's head -- a bull's eye into the mast target! The big iron quivers mightily. Queequeg playfully hauls at the harpoon line and gives the two shocked captains a broad grin. QUEEQUEG (cont'd) Dat whale dead! A silent beat. Bildad turns excitedly to his partner.
24) 13) dialog: What be about me friend?

29) 0) text: A CONGREGATION is gathered in pews, facing a pulpit unlike any other -- built to exactly replicate the bow of a ship. Its towering platform forms the mock ship's sharp prow. Ishmael and Queequeg enter quietly and take a rear seat, Queequeg drawing stares. Among the worshippers sits STARBUCK (30's), a sharp, good-looking, experienced seaman with a pragmatic way about him, full of watchful curiosity. Beside him, his seasoned WIFE and TWO beautiful CHILDREN. Nearby sit Bulkington and his Fiancee, their hands clenched tight. Starbuck's Wife glances toward Bulkington's bride: the girl looks tense and anxious. Up front sits Ahab's weary Wife, red-eyed from long nights of tears. And her son, a fixed, distant gaze. From the high pulpit looms FATHER MAPPLE, a patronly, messiah-like figure. In the rear pews, Ishmael recognizes the minister and nudges Queequeg, whispering aside.

Climbing a swaying rope ladder in the breeze is another harpooner DAGOO, a coal-black barbarian with huge gold loops in his ears. Another giant. A strong gust of wind hits the sails. The men react immediately, scrambling over spars like nimble spiders.

40) 0) text: In his bunk, groggy-eyed Ishmael awakens. A splitting hangover. He sits up painfully with his bandaged hands and focuses on the bustle of men around him: Deckhands wash and dress, preparing for the morning watch. Queequeg shaves before a shard of mirror with the razor edge of his harpoon. A sailor has his head down on a bench, the Carpenter about to pierce his ear with a nail and hammer. Ishmael rises and shuffles to a wash bin, holding his aching head. He winces to the RAP of a hammer -- and a sailor's SCREAM. 42.

63) 0) text: Most of the crew are dead asleep. Ishmael steps quietly among the cramped bunks. No sound but for men's snores, the whish of water against the hull. Ishmael pauses to smile at Queequeg, who sleeps with one 60. arm clutching his harpoon. He makes his way to his bunk. to discern another distant SOUND beyond the hull: An eerie, haunting, watery MELODY from deep in the ocean, away. Pip is awake on his bunk, ears close to the hull, as he listens to the mysterious SOUND. Ishmael crouches beside him, fondly watching the boy. Their eyes meet.

Three boats lower fast, chains CLANKING, ropes HISSING, and splash onto the water. A clamor of SHOUTS, rowers, ha and the three mates scrambling down ladders, into their respective boats. A fourth spare boat is lowered by Fedallah's crew, aloof from the others, working silently and efficiently. In Starbuck's boat, Ishmael mans the oars with others, br with anticipation of his first whale hunt. Queequeg attaches rope lines to his harpoons. The boat casts away from the ship. Stubb cries out from his boat, as they too cast off.
75) 0) text: Ishmael rows arduously, working up a sweat. He looks over the rise of a long swell, just in time to see great Queequeg, the lead rower, rows like a dynamo, guiding the pace. Starbuck works the tiller.

Stubb and Tashtego climb aboard and shoot dagger looks at the Arab, a mix of admiration and resentment. Fe casually picks his teeth with a tapering, knife-long fingernail. They help aboard Ishmael...wet, shivering, in shock. Then come Starbuck and Queequeg, both soaked to the bone but composed as if nothing had happened.

Queequeg slices out a large chunk of red meat, when... An enormous shark lunges out of the water at him! It almost snatches the bloody meat -- but Queequeg tosses it to Dagoo. Queequeg slips and starts to slide down the tail section -- directly toward the massive jaws of the shark! He slams his cutting spear into the whale and pulls himself up. Tashtego spears the shark. A quick, thrashing death.
113) 0) text: High aloft in the rigging, Ishmael paints the spars with tar. Queequeg does the same beside him, both of them hanging precariously over a fifty-foot drop. His hands healed and strong, Ishmael no longer shows any fear. Below him, a crow's nest view: a deck swathed in gore. Revolted by the sight, Ishmael shakes his head woefully.

118) 0) text: Viewed from our deck: the happy, drunken Enderby crew crowd the bulwarks, facing us. They wave flasks of grog, SHOUTING across and gesturing us to join them. Scanning across the faces of our crewmen, we see the eager anticipation of licking lips and ogling eyes. Ishmael gawks at the LAUGHING native girls, their voices like sweet music. Queequeg nods knowingly to himself, a nostalgic look. Sunning in the whaleboat, only Fedellah's crew shows no interest. Flask turns to Stubb, unable to take his eyes off the girls.

Unnoticed by the others, frightened Pip scrambles out from beneath the box plank and stumbles into the basket -- his little legs tangled in spinning lines! Queequeg lets loose a WAR CRY at the fast-receding whale. Ishmael jumps to his feet, straining to get a look... A QUICK, TINY SCREAM startles him from behind! Pip suddenly squirts out past him, dragged by a line and yanked overboard -- into the churning water!

261) 6) dialog: Queequeg harpoon NO MORE! With that, he struts to the foot of the main mast, plops down on the deck and sits erect and unmoving. Gazing dead ahead. Rooted to the spot. Ahab is near exploding. He thinks twice, glancing around at the men. Faces stare at him. Deciding to ignore Queequeg, he marches away to his cabin. Starbuck, no longer able to contain himself, starts after Ahab.

263) 21) dialog: No more. Don't matter wedder be Fiji god or Nantucket god, no more god on dis ship... (deep whisper) No more god. He withdraws back into his chanting, impervious now to Ishmael, lost in a world beyond communication. Ishmael looks plaintively between Starbuck, Dagoo and Tashtego. Their grim expressions offer no solace. The Yojo burns. An ominous chill to the scene. FADE OUT.

A small dinghy drops overboard, SPLASHES down, its tow line strung to the deck above. A figure leans over the landward railing, feeding out rope. Bulkington, his back turned to us.

QUEEQUEG (cont'd) Me Cap'n...me Cap'n...me GOD! Stubb and Flask, their faces aglow in Ahab's white light, kneel before him on the pitching, windy deck. Dagoo drops to his knees beside Tashtego. Fedellah and the Arabs genuflect, prostrate before the master. Removed from it all, Ishmael puzzles over this mad scene. He watches Starbuck: angry but stricken, fighting all the temptations of the devil. Ahab extends a fatherly hand to Starbuck, yearning for his soul as well.

Ishmael swims toward it and hangs on for blessed life.
