He works th bolt -- chambers another round. WE SEE THE LAST COYOTE THROUGH A RIFLE SCOPE. The cross-hairs find the back of the coyote’s head bounci in and out of view. The scope begins to move with it. The rifle invades the silence again. When the muzzle flash disappears, we see the coyote splayed out in the snow. In the distance, the two coyotes wise enough to never tru the scent of man crest a far rise, and drop out of view. The sheep shriek in terror as they run around in a giant, panicked, pointless circle. The man rises and walks toward the carnage he inflicted. The flock runs right toward the man, who doesn’t stop. Doesn’t even look in their direction. The flock almost runs into him before dividing and passin him on either side. They rejoin, and continue their silly circle -- all instinct for survival bred out of them. EXT. SAGEBRUSH PRAIRIE -- DAY. The man looks at the dead coyotes with no emotion. He rem a rope from a backpack. Begins looping the rope around th back feet of a coyote, then moves to another and does the same. All three are now tethered together and he begins the cho of dragging them through the snow and red dirt. He drags them past the flock, which stands idly by, panti like tired dogs. His dark eyes hold no joy. No sorrow either. This is not sport. This is his job. This is CORY LAMBERT.
1) 0) text: Cory warms his free hand against the truck’s vent. Grabs coffee. Takes a sip. The coffee’s cold. Doesn’t matter -- his first cold cup of coffee. He stares at the road.

It is exactly what you would expect from a prefab home ow by a woman with good taste and no money. The place is spotless. Mismatched Lazy Boys and outdated furniture are thoughtfully arranged. Wilma disappears into the kitchen, leaving Cory alone in living room. He stares at the ground. Fumbles with his hat. Looks at t ceiling fan. ... Gives up and turns his gaze toward the fireplace.

1) 37) dialog: 
1) 40) dialog: What did I tell you about pointing that BB gun at people? Casey freezes. Drops everything but the gun.

1) 66) dialog: Life dirties things plenty fast on its own, don’t need any help from you. Casey stares at the floorboard. Gives a submissive nod as excitement of a weekend with dad drains from him. He look out the window as the outskirts of town fade into frozen fields. Cory regrets saying anything at all.
1) 67) dialog: Hey. Casey looks up.
1) 68) dialog: When we get home, I’1l help you dust that hat up the right way. Okay? The tiniest of smiles crosses Casey’s face. Through the windshield we see storm clouds, black as the coming night, push against the mountains that contain the EXT. CORY LAMBERT’S PLACE -- DUSK. Beside a small house is a corral. Four horses huddle together, asses to the wind, wishing like hell it was spr Cory and Casey emerge from an old barn carrying hay. Cory flips a latch and swings the gate open, snapping the hors from their stupor. is. The horses head straight for Casey -- RIPPING HAY FROM HI BUNDLE. Cory tosses his hay bale in a trough, then turns back to Casey.
1) 69) dialog: Push their nose when they rub up on you like that. Casey pushes one horse as another reaches over his head a grabs more hay, whipping Casey in the face when it does, knocking him down. Cory steps up and all the horses hurry toward the trough, like a high school fight breaking up when the principal arrives. Cory looks at his son, who has no hay left to hold. He si on the ground -- face, coat, and hat covered in shredded alfalfa and horse slobber.
1) 70) dialog: Told’'ya I'd get that hat dirty.
1) 72) dialog: We can fix that. Cory smiles. Most kids would’ve been terrified, but Casey stood his ground. Cory walks up behind Casey, lifts him and sets him on a l colored mare that is far too busy eating to care about th boy now on her back.
1) 73) dialog: Remember what I showed you?
1) 75) dialog: You want that horse to be yours some day, prove it. Not to me, to her. Casey lets out a breath. Grabs a handful of mane, and pul back slightly. The mare raises her head, but doesn’t move 14. CORY (CONT’D) Put those boots into the front of her chest. He kicks into her. She bolts up. Casey grabs on tight. CORY (CONT’D) I didn’t say kick. Ask her before you tell her. Just press your boots into her chest. Gentle. He does, and the mare backs up.
1) 76) dialog: Ease up on the mane, and give her a little nudge in the ribs. He does. The mare obeys, and moves forward.
1) 77) dialog: Wherever you look is where she goes. Take her to the gate. Casey stares at the gate with the focus of a surgeon.
1) 78) dialog: Get alongside and open it. Casey sends cues through his feet and negotiates the mare parallel to the fence. He reaches down to the latch. Casey wrestles with the latch his father flipped without effort. He struggles. CORY (CONT’D) Freezes up quick, don’t it ... Give it a good hit. Casey curls his fist and pounds the lever. The gate swing open. Cory pulls Casey off and sets him on the ground, fa the mare.
1) 79) dialog: Let her know you. Casey stands in front of her. The mare inches closer, pressing her nostril to Casey’s nose, inhaling his exhale breath.
1) 80) dialog: Put a hand to her face. Gentle, like a friend. io. He does. Then looks back at his father, all smiles once again.
1) 82) dialog: No, son. That was Arapahoe. Cory closes the gate and they walk to the little house as mare hangs her head over the fence, watching the boy -- forgetting the meal so important a moment ago. INT. CORY’S HOUSE -- NIGHT. Cory and Casey sit on the couch. Casey eats a sandwich an stares at the TV. Cory looks over A TOPO MAP as he speaks the phone.
1) 83) dialog: Yeah. I’m looking at it. There’s drill rigs over there, lions don’t like the noise ... You sure it’s something and not somebody? ... Alright, I’11 check it out in the morning. If you got lions, I’m gonna have to bring Kenny’s hounds in to run ‘em ... Name a Indian with lion hounds and I’1l use him. Call you if I find anything. Cory hangs up. Looks at his son, lost in the television. Little mouth chewing little bites, stopping for a little of soda. Cory watches him. Smiles. Sits back quietly. The smile disappears. Worry replaces it. Above the fireplace is the same photograph of a teenage g dressed to shoot hoops, though much smaller. Cory stares the photo, then back to his son -- who is staring right a him. Casey smiles, then returns to the TV. Cory rubs his eyes. Pinches the bridge of his nose. Hard. Forcing emotion to retreat to wherever emotion comes from
1) 85) dialog: Hey. The sheets move a little.
1) 86) dialog: Come on. Wake up, son. We gotta go. Casey bolts upright.
1) 88) dialog: I'm making breakfast. Get dressed. We gotta feed the horses. Casey rubs furiously at his eyes and yawns.
1) 90) dialog: (Smiles)Yeah ... I can see that. Cory walks out as Casey rises, shaking off the night.
1) 93) dialog: Mountains hold the clouds back with the winds that blows between ‘em. Makes a sort of suction. Sometimes they can suck the storm right out of the clouds. Sometimes they just make it worse, cuz a big storm will sit there and gather strength from the winds that hold it back ... Our ancestors believed the storms hold the spirits of vengeance, and the mountains are our protector. But when enough evil lives in our people, the mountains free the storm to punish the demons among us.
1) 95) dialog: No. Beat.
1) 96) dialog: Sometimes. Up ahead, we see a small, log cabin with a barn even wors off than Cory’s. TWO HORSES run and kick at the dropping pressure and the storm behind it. Cory drives up and park The front door is already open. An Indian man in his 70's stands in long johns and boots with no regard for the sub zero temperature. This is DAN CROWHEART, Casey’s grandfat

1) 111) dialog: Three. She’s got both of last year’s kits with her. They chased your steer around for a while, I bet.
1) 113) dialog: She's teaching them to hunt. And she’s teaching ‘em on livestock ... (Shakes his head) She just got her whole family killed. Cory looks toward the mountains. From here, they tower ov us like a canyon wall.
1) 114) dialog: They’re tucked up there somewhere. I'll go have a look ... You mind watching Casey for a few hours? Crowheart smiles. ZU.
1) 116) dialog: Got gas in your snowmobile? EXT. WIND RIVER RESERVATION -- DAY. Cory drives a snowmobile over the frozen ground, followin the tracks. He is far from the cabin. Far from anything. mountains are so close, you could almost reach out and to them. To the left, the prairie is broken with GAS DRILL A GAS DRILL, all jutting eighty-feet into the air like gian steel darts fired into the earth. Cory slows, sees something he snowmobile. Looks down. We do HUMAN FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW. THE GROUND AROUND THEM. Cory steps off the snowmobile print -- knows instantly this didn’t expect. Stops the too.
1) 118) text: From a distance, he is invisible. It is as though the sno itself stood up and walked. WE WALK BEHIND HIM NOW. The mountains are a hundred yards from him. Pine trees lo over the snow. The clouds cast a shadow that is visible j fifty yards ahead. Cory studies the ground. Takes two more steps, then stops IN FRONT OF HIM IS A PERFECT IMPRINT OF THE GIRL. As thou she laid down and made a bloody snow-angel. We see where she stood up and stumbled toward a small arr just ahead. Cory slings the rifle over his shoulder slowly. Silently. Pulls out his RUGER BLACKHAWK PISTOL. He hides the pistol under his coat, and cocks the hammer no noise. 21. He raises the pistol to eye level and moves forward. Wher he looks -- the pistol points. He crests the little arroy and stares down. At first he sees nothing. Then -- A HAND. REACHING FROM T SNOW. He looks around. Nothing. He looks at the ground. No trac except those of the girl. He moves to the hand. Gently brushes the snow away. THE RUNNING GIRL’S FACE STARES BACK. Frozen in a constipated moan. Blood frozen to her face. Blood mixed with the snow ice around her. Cory stares at her -- almost as frozen as she is. His breath leaves him -- but not from the sight of a dead body. He’s seen plenty in his day. This is a body he know A snowflake falls. Then another. Takes off his back pack, pulls out a two-way radio. Turns to channel 16 -- the emergency channel -- and speaks with hollow voice.
1) 119) dialog: I need emergency assistance. Repeat. Emergency assistance requested ... Come back? Static crackles, then a voice filters through.
1) 121) dialog: I found a body on the Wind River Indian Reservation west of Boulder Flats, I need Tribal Police to respond to the following location... We pull back and snow begins to fall. We pull back farthe and Cory fades as the snow falls faster. A STRONG WIND pushes the snowflakes horizontal -- it is snowing sideways. The storm breaks free from the mountains’ grasp with a vengeful howl -- ready to punish this land and her people all the evil they’ve done. ZZ. EXT. DAN CROWHEART’S CABIN -— DAY. Cory stands on the little porch with TRIBAL POLICE CHIEF SHOYO, 50, kind, round face and large, heavy frame. They watch the storm throw snow at the earth like shrapne Barely visible to the left of the house are THREE TRIBAL
1) 126) dialog: We're losing the tracks.
1) 128) dialog: Oughta let me follow ‘em while I still can.
1) 130) dialog: You call her folks yet, Ben?
1) 132) dialog: It’s Natalie. We look out from the porch and can barely make out -- A B SUV, crawling through the snow on the main road.
1) 133) dialog: There’s your Feds. INT. BLACK SUV -- CONTINUOUS. FBI AGENT JANE BANNER, 28, struggles to see through the s as her GPS directs her.
1) 139) dialog: Can’t see the road. Beat.
1) 141) dialog: I’ll go get ‘em. Cory walks to his snowmobile. 24. INT. JANE’S SUV -- CONT. She can barely make out the house a quarter-mile away, an the police vehicles -- white themselves -- are completely invisible. Jane pulls a ROAD ATLAS out and studies it. Looks back ou the window. Hears what sounds like the whine of a CHAIN SAW. Cory appears from the snow like a wraith, pulls up beside Jane's window. Knocks on it. No idea a gun is now pointed him on the other side of the vehicle’s door. She cracks the window, leery.
1) 142) dialog: You FBI?
1) 144) dialog: No. But I’1l take you to them. This thing in four-wheel drive?
1) 146) dialog: Alright, follow me. Cory whips the snowmobile around, spewing snow, then driv toward the house.
1) 158) dialog: Body’s a ten mile drive by snowmobile. You’d be dead before we got there. Zo. She looks away from his dark, intense eyes. Feels a littl silly as she shivers in place.
1) 162) dialog: Come inside. We'll get you fixed up. He points toward the cabin. Ben extends a hand to her as reaches the first step. Crowheart has her elbow by the ti she’s on the porch. It is clear none of these men think s will live five minutes out here. She should be grateful. She isn’t. Pride makes her shake of the men cradling her like a wounded bird. She walks in the house. Ben looks at Cory, shaking his head.
1) 176) dialog: A couple more hours, son. I’m sorry.
1) 178) dialog: I promise. Casey seems to tighten and deflate at the same time, as h father rises and walks to the door. Ben looks outside.
1) 180) dialog: It’s ten below outside. You leave that pride on the porch and hug me like your prom date, understood? Jane is so offended she almost falls backwards.
1) 182) dialog: I don’t want to insult you, just making sure there’s only one girl froze to death out there today. She turns from him and walks out into the storm. 29. EXT. SAGEBRUSH PRAIRIE -- DAY. Jane sits behind Cory on the snowmobile. They race throug the white at 60 miles-per-hour. Jane presses her face into the back of this stranger -- h hands tucked under his ass -- as she experiences cold ina manner unexplainable to those who haven’t endured it. Up ahead, we see FOUR POLICE SNOWMOBILES, and FOUR OFFICE huddling around a MOBILE PROPANE HEATER. TWO EMT’S huddle beside the body. Cory and Ben park. Walk toward them. Cory doesn’t wait fo Jane to start asking questions.
1) 183) dialog: I picked up her tracks about 300 meters to the south. Jane nods as she struggles to shake off the bone-breaking cold. They walk past the officers to NATALIE HANSON’S BODY, and EMT holding a HEAT GUN -- basically a very powerful hair dryer -- that he waves along Natalie’s body where it meet the ice that holds her. Jane kneels next to her.
1) 205) dialog: Like it’s my job. Which it is.

1) 218) dialog: Only thing I can tell you about is the tracks.
1) 220) dialog: Look here. She leans over him. NATALIE’S FOOT PRINT AND FROZEN BLOOD NOW MIXED WITH SNOW is visible. CORY (CONT’D) See how the toes twist out? And the front of the track is deeper than the back -- almost no imprint of the heel?
1) 222) dialog: She was running. He stands. Points to Natalie’s body thirty yards away. CORY (CONT’D) She ran until she dropped. There’s a spot over here where she fell ... Cory walks to the bloody snow angel.
1) 223) dialog: A pool of blood where her face hit. Gets down to twenty below out here at night. You breathe that cold air deep in your lungs -- like when you're running, it’ll freeze em. Lungs fill up with blood, you start coughing it up. He points to the impression of her face and the pool of blood. Beat.
1) 224) dialog: Wherever she came from, she ran all the way here. Her lungs burst and she curled up under that tree. She didn’t freeze to death ... She drowned.
1) 226) dialog: I seen tourists freeze to death in these mountains when it was barely 40 degrees ... I seen a fur trader caught in his own trap, drag himself six miles to a forest service cabin and radio for help. In the dead of winter ... There ain’t no gauge for the will to live. Some have it. Plenty don’t +. I knew this girl. She was a fighter. However far we think she ran, my guess is she ran farther. Cory looks east. 34.
1) 227) dialog: I got to get back to my son. I promised him a few hours.
1) 230) dialog: There’s three of ‘em. And I didn’t.
1) 232) dialog: I’m a hunter.
1) 234) dialog: I hunt predators. She looks back at the police officers trying to free Natalie’s corpse from a frozen land intent on keeping her
1) 236) dialog: Okay. 3D. INT. JANE’S SUV -- NIGHT. SNOW pounds the windshield as the wipers work frantically remove it. Snow swarms in the headlights like locust. Jane leans forward, chin almost resting on the steering wheel, straining to see the road.
1) 277) dialog: Thought you were sleeping. Casey looks at his feet.
1) 279) dialog: Bout what? Beat.
1) 281) dialog: Come over here. 4uU. Casey shuffles over and sits at the table.
1) 282) dialog: Want a glass of milk?
1) 284) dialog: She's just a girl. Lost her way in the snow. Casey looks at the reloader and the gun resting against t table.
1) 286) dialog: Work. Cory seats another rifle casing.
1) 288) dialog: She died from the cold.
1) 290) dialog: Yeah, son. I’m afraid she did. Cory pushes back from the table. Sets the rifle on the ta Pulls his son onto his lap.
1) 292) dialog: I’m doing some work for the government this week. It’s for that.
1) 294) dialog: I don’t know what it is yet. But I’m gonna try and figure it out ... You wanna go back to bed?
1) 296) dialog: I ain’t going to bed for a while. Casey nods as if that wasn’t an answer he had considered.
1) 297) dialog: You wanna curl up on the sofa, and I‘1l take you back with me when I’m done?
1) 299) dialog: What’s the test?

1) 309) dialog: You know son, most of my experience has been with the George Washington and Abraham Lincoln variety.
1) 311) dialog: Those I know. Cory pulls up in front of the elementary school.
1) 313) dialog: Your mom. Unless the road from Jackson's too bad, then it’1l be me.
1) 315) dialog: You don’t ever wish that, son. 45. He doesn’t.
1) 317) dialog: I’1ll see you Thursday. Then you’re mine for a week. Casey smiles.
1) 319) dialog: Good luck on that test.
1) 370) dialog: Hello. EXT. TROUT CREEK ROAD -- CONT. We watch Cory’s truck -- pulling a small flat-bed trailer carrying a snowmobile -- slow down, make a three-point tu in the middle of the road, and head off the other way. 49. INT. HANSON HOME -- FORT WASHAKIE, WYOMING -- DAY. We are inside a house that screams poverty. Furniture is and broken to the point of barely being functional. Faux- siding of the manufactured home is fraying at the edges. Still, extreme care has been given to make it into a home Photos of Natalie and a handsome TEENAGE BOY are pasted o every wall. We hear Ben’s voice as we look over the home.
1) 395) dialog: I'd like to tell you it gets easier, but it doesn’t. If there’s a comfort -- you get used to the pain if you let yourself ... I went to a grief seminar in Casper. Don’t know why, just ... It hurt so much, I was searching for anything that could make it go away ... (MORE )
1) 397) dialog: That’s what I wanted this seminar to do -- make it go away. The instructor come up to me after the seminar was over, sat beside me and said, “I got good news and bad news. Bad news is you'll never be the same. You’1ll never be whole. Ever. What was taken from you can’t be replaced. You’re daughter’s gone. ... Now the good news -- as soon as you accept that, as soon as you let yourself suffer, allow yourself to grieve ... You'll be able to visit her in your mind, and remember all the joy she gave you. All the love she knew. Right now, you don’t even have that, do you?” Martin finds himself shaking his head ‘no’, even though t question wasn’t directed at him.
1) 398) dialog: He said, “that’s what not accepting this will rob from you”. Cory looks at Martin.
1) 399) dialog: If you shy from the pain of it, then you rob yourself of every memory of her, my friend. Every one. From her first step to her last smile. You’1l kill ‘em all. Cory puts his hand on Martin’s neck, guides his eyes up t him. CORY (CONT’D) Take the pain ... Take the pain, Martin. It’s the only way to keep her with you. Martin drops his head into his lap. Cory resists the temptation to do the same. The big man stands up, pulls a cigarette from his pocket, lights it. Walks out into the snow.
1) 401) dialog: What you do now you do for your son.
1) 404) dialog: He stays with the Littlefeather boys, doesn’t he.
1) 406) dialog: That’s what they asked me to do, but that’s not what I’m doing.
1) 408) dialog: I’m a hunter. What do you think I’m doing? Martin walks toward the porch, bores his hawk eyes into h old friend.

1) 415) dialog: Who goes into the mountains just before a storm ... EXT. SAM LITTLEFIELD’S HOUSE -- CONT. Jane and Ben still stand outside the door. Ben knocks aga hard enough to knock the flimsy door through the frame. The music shuts off. Feet move toward the door. It opens. SAM LITTLEFEATHER is 20, tall, and rail thin. His shaved is covered in a RAIDER’S SKULL CAP. His wild eyes fueled three day’s worth of meth. He nods and bounces in place.
1) 434) dialog: Skinny one’s Natalie’s brother. Dy.
1) 448) dialog: Because I found her raped and killed right over there, son. That’s why. Beat.
1) 451) dialog: This is how we find him.
1) 453) dialog: Okay, where’s he live? Where’s he work? What’s his name. (MORE )
1) 456) dialog: Look there. She takes the binoculars. Looks through them.
1) 458) dialog: You see my arm through the binocs?
1) 460) dialog: When I move my hand, look where it was ... You see the tracks? a sled track, filled with snow ... Look for the shadow in it.
1) 462) dialog: Now look straight out -- at the base of the mountains, you'll see it easy there. In the distance, the slight indentation stands out. The tracks run straight from the house up into the pine trees that cover the mountain.
1) 464) dialog: Natalie died over there -- seven miles(He points north). Those tracks lead to the mountain from here -- that’s five miles. He points south to tall drill rigs jutting up from the ground.
1) 465) dialog: There’s West-Central’s nearest rigs. Six miles. Someone unloaded sleds right here and drove way the hell out there, but there’s no tracks coming back -- why is that? (Cory points at the house) Do those assholes look like they’re up for a trek ten miles into the snow? In what -- that minivan? The answers are out there. It’s hard to say whether she doesn’t buy what he’s saying just dreads going into the mountains. She comes clean.
1) 467) dialog: It’s all I’ve ever done.
1) 469) dialog: What channel you running?
1) 472) dialog: I'll radio if we come across anything. He guns his sled and they shoot off over the snow. EXT. WYOMING PLAINS -- LATER. WE ARE FLYING OVER THE SNOW -- ALARMINGLY FAST. Again, Ja finds herself pasted to Cory’s back -- hiding from the sn that pelts every exposed part of her. The forest looms over us. We are climbing now. Trees begi whipping past us. Cory doesn’t slow down. We are moving almost vertically up the mountain -- the en whines angrily as the snowmobile lurches uphill, digging into the snow then firing out of it like a rocket. They reach a bench -- a level area that cuts into the mountain. Cory stops. Cuts the engine, it is instantly silent. Jane dares to look up and is shocked to find the valley f a thousand feet below them. Cory steps off -- pulling the stainless steel rifle from case, and levering a round into the chamber. He speaks softly, aware they are both hunter and hunted o here.
1) 473) dialog: The tracks move south from here.
