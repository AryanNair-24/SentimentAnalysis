2) 118) dialog: Three days ago. Heck, we didn’t know what to do -- waiting to hear back from corporate about whether to write up his termination papers or call you guys. Jane and Ben look at Curtis who seems genuinely concerned Another snowmobile pulls up carrying another security officer. He steps up -- we can’t help but notice the scratches that run down his face.
2) 120) dialog: They’re here about Matt --
2) 125) dialog: Hit a pine branch doing sixty and see what happens to you.
2) 128) dialog: Oh, I requested helmets. My supervisor said, “But snow’s soft, ain't it?” Corporate’s in Texas, what can I tell you. Everyone has a chuckle at that.
2) 130) dialog: Yep, we all do. OS.
2) 132) dialog: Sure. (Stepping off his snowmobile) I’1l1 walk you up. Jane looks over the two security guards -- well dressed, belts with pistols, flashlights, hand cuffs. And beat to shit. They seem professional and courteous. She strains to pick the bad apple. TWO MORE SECURITY OFFICERS WALK UP THROUGH THE SNOW. She looks them over as well, all of their faces torn and bruised. The entire group begins moving off toward the trailers .. EXT. MOUNTAINS -- DAY. Cory works his snowmobile through terrain not meant for machines -- he takes it almost vertically up the side of mountain. We move past the area where Matt’s body was fou surrounded by POLICE TAPE. He drives past, looks for trac There are none. Continues east, over white powder. Judging from the snow, is the first living thing to traverse this land since the storm. Then he stops. Looks down -- LION TRACKS. HE SHUTS DOWN THE ENGINE. STEPS OFF. He pulls his silver-colored bear killer from its case and follows the tracks around a bend. He walks across what looks to be an endless plain of whit surrounded by dark pines tasked with containing it. He comes to a rock outcropping that creates something rar viewed during winter in Wyoming -- an area with no snow. THE CARCASS OF A DEER, almost completely devoured, lays i front of it. He raises his rifle, moves toward the shallo cave. o4. He stops. Listens. Hears shallow breathing. Cocks the ham steps closer. Stares at the black hole nature cut into the side of the mountain. Pulls a flashlight from his pocket, points it toward the cavern -- THREE SETS OF RED EYES STARE BACK. He lowers the light a bit -- A MOUNTAIN LION AND HER TWO STARE BACK.

2) 154) dialog: This is leased land on a reservation -- you have no authority, deputy--

One of the securit guards holds a MOSSBERG 590 SHOTGUN tucked to his shoulde barrel inching up from the snow toward the officers. Emotion is overtaking reason. A security guard stands mere feet from a BIA officer, bot their hands gripping pistols.

WE ARE IN THE TRAILER’S BATHROOM. STEAM FROM THE SHOWER H CLOUDED THE MIRROR. We hear knocking. Push open the bathroom door.
