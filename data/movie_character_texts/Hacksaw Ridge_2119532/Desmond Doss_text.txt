Two men in my home town who were declared 4-F killed themselves because they couldn’t serve. I had a job in a defense plant and could've taken a deferment but it didn’t seem right. It didn’t seem right to me that other folks should fight and die for my rights, including my right to believe what I believe. Being a medic seems perfect. I'’11 be right in the middle with the other guys, no less danger, but instead of taking life, I’1l be saving it. With the world so set on tearing itself apart, it doesn’t seem such a bad thing to me to want to put a little bit of it back together. The men in the court can’t embrace Desmond’s position, bu they can’t deny his sincerity. DESMOND (cont'd) All I’ve ever wanted was a chance to serve my country and to protect my fellow soldiers.

He carries a full field backpack plus three plasma sets, a surgical kit, and two canteens, one full of water one full of rubbing alcohol.

It is Desmond's first glimpse of the enemy and despite th treachery of their assault, this soldier does not appear formidable. The Japanese Soldier looks young, barely out his teens, and so malnourished he’s more skin and bones t anything else. Blood bubbles at the corners of his mouth.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d) We need Okinawa as a staging area for the invasion of Japan but the entire movement of the Army has been held up, right here. Our Navy is stuck off the coast getting hit by Kamikaze attacks and losing a ship and a half a day. Hacksaw Ridge is the key to their defences. We take Hacksaw, we get Okinawa. We get Okinawa, we take Japan. So the sooner we get this done, the sooner we can all go home. Questions? The men are silent. CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d) OK. See you on top. Everyone start to leave. CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d) Doss. Desmond returns. Glover waits until they are alone. CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d) That damn ridge has cost us so many Americans we don’t even have an accurate count yet. When we attack, the only hope any man has of surviving is to kill every Jap he sees without hesitation. Whatever nonsense you believe, you keep it to yourself--and do your job. You understand me?

Over their heads, U.S. mortars and artillery shells arc i and explode on top of the Ridge. As medics, Desmond and Schecter wait the standard 10-15 f behind the men. They will follow the attack from this position so they can better see when someone goes down. Schecter goes over his supplies obsessively. Desmond closes his eyes and says a silent prayer. Several the other men notice. Desmond whispers “Amen” and takes h New Testament from his pocket, running his fingers over i cover. Suddenly, the artillery barrage stops. Desmond opens his eyes and nervously tucks his Bible away in his breast poc Captain Glover looks at his watch. It’s time. He hand signals the “go ahead” to his squad leaders.

This is the Charge of the Light Brigade. Every man is utterly terrified and is forcing himself to move forward by a she act of will. TWO TEAMS set up ladders against the cliff face. Immediately, two men with ropes climb to the top of the ladders and toss their grappling hooks onto the lip of th Ridge, trying to grab a secure hold. Surprisingly there is little enemy resistance--only some sniping and a few knee mortar rounds. One soldier goes do Desmond hurries towards the wounded soldier when a mortar round lands nearby on the rocks. A handful of razor-sharp shards of limestone smack Desmond in the right side, spin him around, and knocking him down to the ground! Desmond’s hand and face are bleeding. He looks in wonder his own blood - half terrified at how close the shell was half delighted at the modest nature of his injury. Desmond wipes the blood off on his own shirt, and plunges back towards the line. The soldiers swarm up the cliff face and finally onto the of the Ridge which is revealed to be a small plateau. 3.4.13 62.

This tiny protected area is all the shelter the plateau offers. Captain Glover and the rest of the men are huddled behind berm, peering cautiously over the edge. Desmond reaches them just as Glover gives the signal to m forward across the berm and onto...
71) 0) text: The plateau, seemingly open, is actually crisscrossed by numerous cunningly hidden small RAVINES and GULLIES, and still smoking from the pre-assault bombardment. There are Japanese forces or defensive structures visible. That doesn’t mean they aren’t there. As Glover and his men mov out into the open, all hell breaks loose. HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE from three cleverly camouflaged positions rakes the top of the plateau. Simultaneously, there is a shower of HAND GRENADES from individual Japanese Soldiers hidden in natural folds and made trenches in the ground, or popping out of camouflage “Spider Holes.” Japanese KNEE MORTARS, 81 MM MORTARS, and even 47 MM guns launched from positions hidden in the rear of the Ridge - “Reverse Slope” - fall among the Americans with devastati results. The Company responds with their own grenades, carbines, a BAR but the enemy is so well hidden it’s hard to find a target. Immediately, the Company starts taking casualties In front of Desmond, a SOLDIER takes the full blast from Japanese mortar shell and is tossed up into the air and backwards, slamming into the ground. Desmond launches himself over the berm and runs to the do man, ignoring the firing and explosions all around him. T man has lost both his legs from the knees down. 3.4.13 63.

Desmond picks up the Wounded Soldier and carries him to t cliff edge. Desmond looks down. It’s seventy feet straight down. It didn’t seem so far climbing up but it looks like the bottom of the Grand Can from here. Desmond wraps a bandage around his right hand and grabs o of the climbing ropes, while he simultaneously tries to secure the soldier with his left hand. Suddenly, there is an ear-splitting ROAR, like a freight train approaching, moving down towards him. Desmond looks to see... 3.4.13 64. A huge JAPANESE SPIGOT MORTAR SHELL, the size of a garbag can, stuffed with twenty pounds of high explosives, arcin down directly towards him. Desmond looks around in terror. To jump from the cliff wo kill both him and his patient. Desmond pushes the Wounded Soldier down and covers him with his own body... The shell passes within six inches of Desmond and lands a the base of the cliff - and fails to go off! Desmond shudders with relief. Shakily, Desmond secures the wounded Soldier, grabs the r with his one free hand, and using his feet to slow his descent, jumps off the cliff and slides down the rope. Desmond can’t control their motion very well and the rope begins to swing, throwing them into the cliff face. Desmo tries to put himself between the rock and the wounded Soldier.
