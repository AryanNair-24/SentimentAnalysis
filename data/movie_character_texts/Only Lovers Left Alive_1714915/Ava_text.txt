16) 6) dialog: (with English accent) Adam! Eve! Oh my god, it’s so great to see you! She approaches ADAM as he and EVE step into the room. She throws her arms around his neck, ADAM nearly cringing. AVA (cont'd) You’re still so beautiful. ADAM peels her off and she rushes to embrace EVE. ADAM crosses the room and turns off the music. AVA (cont'd) Eve! My darling, totally amazing sister! How I’ve missed you! She unwraps herself enough to look into EVE’s eyes. AVA (cont'd) Did you get my message?
16) 8) dialog: Oh, how awesome! It works! AVA laughs and EVE pushes her back a little, still holdin to AVA’s arms.
16) 11) dialog: What are you guys talking about?
16) 13) dialog: (laughing again) Oh Eve, you’re so old-fashioned. You’re probably still afraid of garlic! AVA laughs yet again, while EVE and ADAM exchange looks.
16) 15) dialog: (completing EVE’s sentence) ...of someone’s residence without being properly invited. Yeah, yeah, yeah, nasty luck et cetera.
16) 17) dialog: (turning to ADAM) Oh my god I love it, Adam! It’s totally brilliant! Can I get a download?
16) 20) dialog: (sitting back down on the couch) Yes! No! I mean, I came to see you! I had a feeling you were both here. (pause) I’ve been living in L.A...
16) 22) dialog: No. ADAM and EVE glance at one another. AVA (cont'd) (bursting into laughter) I’m here with you guys!
16) 28) dialog: (feigning confusion) What? When? Are you still upset about the Paris thing? EVE crosses and sits on the couch next to AVA.
16) 30) dialog: Yeah! (then demurely) But I’m really, really, really hungry. ADAM turns around, facing them. AVA looks back and forth between them, expectantly. AVA (cont'd) (in a childlike voice) Do you maybe have something?
16) 34) dialog: I just want to see where you keep it.
16) 36) dialog: (lifting her head) Oh, Eve. It’s so totally awesome to see you! Again, she hides her face against EVE’s shoulder. With a hint of hesitation, EVE strokes AVA’s hair.
17) 1) dialog: (O.S., muffled) Eve? Adam? A lamp is switched on, EVE’s arm stretching to it from th bed. Next to her, ADAM wearily opens his eyes.
17) 3) dialog: (0.S.)
17) 7) dialog: (lightly stroking ADAM’s pillow) Isn’t it time to get up? It’s dark out already and I’m starving.
17) 10) dialog: Some more of that good stuff?
17) 12) dialog: Where do you keep it?
17) 14) dialog: Ok. Before getting up she flips up the corner of ADAM’s pillo revealing half of his annoyed face. AVA (cont'd) Peek-a-boo, I see you. ADAM immediately pulls the pillow back over his face. AVA laughs, leans in and kisses EVE on the cheek, then exits. EVE sleepily stares after her as AVA closes the door.
17) 17) dialog: (whining) Oh...Why did you turn it off? I love that! I found it on YouTube.
17) 19) dialog: I don’t feel good.
17) 21) dialog: (weakly) Maybe.
17) 26) dialog: I’ve tried. AVA sits up reaching for a glass. ADAM and EVE watch as s guzzles it down.
17) 28) dialog: (setting down her empty glass) Oh my god! That is good! EVE clinks her glass against ADAM’s and both take sips. A becoming more and more animated, reaches for the stainles canister, but ADAM intercedes. He pours a little more int her glass. AVA drains it immediately.
17) 30) dialog: Let’s play some of your music, Adam!
17) 32) dialog: Oh yeah? How come I heard it in L.A. then?
17) 34) dialog: In, like, an underground music club.
17) 36) dialog: So, don’t.
17) 38) dialog: Oh, I could tell immediately! (pause) I might have been born at night, but I wasn’t born last night, ya know. (she laughs) She picks up one of ADAM’s vintage electric guitars. He quickly takes it from her, putting it down in a safer pla AVA shrugs and sits down on EVE’s lap. EVE pushes her off to one side, but AVA puts her arms aro her sister, nuzzling her shoulder like a needy child. AVA (cont'd) Well then I’m gonna go out. I wanna hear some music.
17) 40) dialog: (babyish) But, I wanna go out with you guys.
17) 42) dialog: What a big meanie. (then stroking EVE’s hair) I bet he never takes you out, ever, right?
17) 44) dialog: Ooh, a drive. Big deal. I mean go somewhere. Where there’s music. Don’t you wanna go, Eve?
17) 46) dialog: Hurray! Adam’s gonna take us out! Oh my god let’s have another drink!
18) 4) dialog: They were brilliant! Did you like them Adam? No response.
18) 8) dialog: I’m Ava, she’s Eve.
18) 13) dialog: I filled it before we left. At home.
18) 15) dialog: (energized) Yeah! Want some? Extending the flask toward ADAM.
18) 18) dialog: Mmm!
18) 20) dialog: Sure, Ian. Manically, in a flash, Adam snatches the flask from IAN’s hands before it reaches his lips. Just after, ADAM appear almost surprised by his own actions. 66.
18) 22) dialog: (admiringly) I know. He’s fucking brilliant. And he’s totally hot. ADAM turns toward EVE. She smiles. He takes a swig from t flask, then puts it away inside his jacket.
18) 24) dialog: (still playfully touching
18) 38) text: INT. ADAM’S LIVINGROOM - NIGHT EVE, ADAM, AVA and IAN are in ADAM’s livingroom/studio. E sits on one end of the couch, while at the other end AVA nestled very close to IAN, her hand lightly moving undern the sleeve of his shirt. ADAM, standing, is collecting re and boxes of his tapes. Music plays, but not ADAM’s music
18) 42) dialog: Me too. Carrying a stack of tape reels and boxes, ADAM moves to t doorway, then turns and nods to EVE. She gets up from the couch.
18) 44) dialog: Adam? ADAM pauses in the doorway. AVA (cont'd) Could I have that flask back? Please?
18) 46) dialog: (pouting) But I’m just so...so thirsty.
18) 49) dialog: He’s gonna leave as soon as he finishes his little beer. ADAM glares at IAN, who nervously drinks from his bottle.
18) 51) dialog: (her arms still encircling him) Yeah. He’s gonna go in just a few minutes. ADAM leaves the room. EVE leans in and kisses AVA on the cheek.
19) 11) dialog: Wha? EVE slaps her across the face. AVA (cont'd) Ouch!
19) 13) dialog: (whining immaturely) Oh, I don’t know. AVA struggles to stand but EVE gives her a hard push, and lands back on the couch, sitting on top of IAN. AVA (cont'd) Hey! Ouch.
19) 15) dialog: Please, Eve. I don’t know. She looks at IAN’s dead face, his mouth open grotesquely. 72. AVA (cont'd) (whining) I was still so hungry, and he was just so cute. (pause) Now I feel sick.
19) 17) dialog: (starting to cry) I didn’t mean to. I just couldn’t resist... EVE and AVA turn to see ADAM, in his bathrobe, standing i the doorway. He has stopped dead in his tracks, in comple shock. He stares at IAN in disbelief, then rushes over an throws AVA to the floor. AVA (cont'd) (landing hard) Ouch! Adam!
19) 19) dialog: (whimpering) I...I don’t know...Please! ADAM pulls back his leg to kick AVA.
19) 27) dialog: (crying) Where am I supposed to go?
19) 29) dialog: (pleading tearfully) Eve, please! I didn’t mean it! I’m not well! You’re my only sister.
19) 31) dialog: (crying quietly) You know what you guys are? You’re condescending snobs! Just wait. (sniffle) You’1ll find out what the world is really like out there. She pulls her coat on and, buttoning it clumsily, disappe down the empty, darkened street.
