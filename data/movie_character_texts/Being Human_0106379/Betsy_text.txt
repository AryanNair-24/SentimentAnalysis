152) 6) dialog: It's bleached... and it isn't recycled... you don't care... you just buy junk...
152) 9) text: Betsy keeps on the attack.
152) 10) dialog: Everything you buy is junk... I don't eat steak... and what's this...
152) 12) dialog: Ugh! Why don't you ask us what we like... it'll save you money... you buy junk, we won't eat it...
152) 17) text: Betsy moves off with the cart.
152) 18) dialog: I do it every week anyway.
153) 0) text: Hector is filling up the car in a gas station close to the Safeway. An attractive woman is filling her car in the next line. Her eyes and Hector's meet. For some reason they exchange the smallest smile. For a few brief moments they are talking without words as their tanks fill. The ten billionth romance in the history of the planet sparks into life and fizzles out again in the twinkling of an eye. By the time their credit cards are back in their pockets their love is a memory. From the back of the car the kids have watched it all. Betsy gives Hector a withering look of disapproval as he climbs back into the car.
155) 0) text: The car pulls up at the holiday house. Hector gets out. It is dark, but we can hear the sound of the SEA and there is sand underfoot. Hector walks to the house and unlocks the door. He puts on a couple of exterior lights. He carries Thomas, still sleeping, from the car and into the house. Betsy follows him, still half-asleep, groaning fussily. She talks through her yawns.
155) 1) dialog: Are you going to bring the flowers in?

158) 14) dialog: They don't mean a thing.     Why?
158) 16) text: The mystery of Betsy's pancake dream is evidently lost in infinity. Hector changes the subject.
159) 13) dialog: The last two.
160) 2) dialog: They don't come over so much. The shellfish have gone... that's what...
160) 4) dialog: Yes... and it happens to be true.
161) 3) dialog: The seats are wet.
161) 9) text: Betsy has the grace to smile as the three of them climb aboard the rockets. As the attendant releases the brakes and cranks them up into the drizzle, 'round and 'round, Hector knows that he has to do something to break the awful distance between him and his kids. He looks at them. They sit grimly in their rockets, one in front of him and one behind. Their faces are set in expressions of what? Boredom? Resignation? Patience? Expectancy? Then he realizes what is going on. They are waiting for him to open up to them, talk to them seriously, explain himself. He looks at Betsy's face and sees in it the years of his absence, her stoicism, her patience, her courage. It moves him. He leans over to her.

161) 12) dialog: All right, if you want to...

162) 10) dialog: What he means is why did you stay away?
162) 13) dialog: Sure she has... but lots of people get divorced... that doesn't mean they disappear...
162) 20) dialog: It's forty minutes away on a slow bus...
162) 26) dialog: Thomas wanted to visit you in jail, but Mom wouldn't let him.                        *
162) 38) dialog: That's what you do now?
162) 40) text: Betsy shrugs her shoulders.

163) 9) dialog: I know... that's what I mean... why did you leave just then?
163) 10) text: Hector looks at Betsy. She is beginning to cry silently. He puts a tentative arm around her shoulder.
163) 12) text: Betsy is still crying.
163) 13) dialog: It doesn't matter.
163) 15) dialog: I passed.
163) 17) dialog: I'm a life-saver now.
163) 20) dialog: Hurry up, Tom!                                          *
163) 25) dialog: I'm allowed.
163) 28) dialog: Who said I'd let you eat a steak?
163) 31) dialog: Sure.
163) 33) dialog: I'd have to take the morning off school.
163) 35) dialog: No, that could be good...
163) 36) text: Betsy and Hector are quite close now.
164) 0) text: Hector and Betsy are walking on the shore.     Thomas tag along behind them.
164) 1) dialog: What's she like? How did you meet her?

164) 7) dialog: That's what it's like... you should know that.
164) 12) dialog: Don't be so tough on yourself. You seem to want to be... you don't have to...

164) 20) dialog: You'll never know.
164) 21) text: Future generations of women are going to be just as unknowable to our Hectors as past ones were. Betsy moves off briskly along the beach. Hector trails after her, hooked.
165) 0) text: Betsy and Thomas are in a small fragile rowboat, some distance from the shore. They are watching Hector who is collecting a pile of large stones on the beach. Another Hector and another pile of stones. This one is making a fire for the barbecue. These human rituals never stop.
165) 1) dialog: I thought he was taller.
165) 6) dialog: I suppose so. He's getting fat, too. I bet I could beat him at the breast-stroke now.
166) 3) dialog: We're fine!
167) 0) text: At the very moment of sunset Betsy is trying to capture it in a watercolor sketch. She has set up an easel on the beach. It's like action painting. She works frantically on the picture, racing the sun as it dips into the ocean. Tough little Betsy can even lose patience with the sun.
167) 1) dialog: Why does it always go so fast...? Thomas is laughing at her. He has seen    her attempt thi before. Hector has other concerns. He     is trying to light his barbecue. Match after match    disappears into his elaborate stone structure, only to   fizzle out. The sun finally vanishes, and Betsy goes limp at her easel. The sun has won the race again. She and Thomas watch Hector trying to light the fire. After a while he is conscious of their amused attention on him, then he becomes a little self-conscious.
168) 28) text: Betsy chimes in.
168) 29) dialog: I don't know. If it wasn't for us there'd be nobody around to see it all.
168) 36) dialog: Wait a minute... I know... the whole universe is inside a speck of dust that's lying in a ball of fluff in the cuff of a pair of pants hanging over the back of a chair...
168) 39) dialog: Skimmed milk...
168) 43) dialog: I've got a better one... we're all inside a speck of pollen that's stuck to the wing of a bee while it sits on a flower...
168) 50) dialog: Why are you always talking about                     * pancakes... what's wrong with you?                   *
