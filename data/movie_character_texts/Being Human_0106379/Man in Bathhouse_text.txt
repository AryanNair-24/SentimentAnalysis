156) 1) dialog: This is good, Tony, the stones are talking to me already... now here's something... travel... movement... Tony, are you planning a move... travel... anything?
156) 3) dialog: The big one, eh, Tony? These stones are really talking here... what are you planning for yourself in California?
156) 5) dialog: Tony, these stones really like what you're planning... there is no doubt in my mind about that... now listen... you have to be specific... these stones really want to tell you something, be it love, money or the purpose of your life... but I want a specific question from you... think about it... what do you want to know... love... or your income level next year? Be as specific as you can, Tony... Perhaps this might have enthralled one of our earlier Hectors, but our modern one is simply restless. He stands up and leaves the room.
