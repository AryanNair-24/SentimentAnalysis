We see this. He said nothing, showed no discomfort as his shirt blossomed with blood poppies. His stoicism reminded me of the brave men who died in the first world war. Every year on that day I hold a minute’s silence in his honour. OLIVER gathers up several A4 pages, signs ‘Good luck! Bes wishes for a persecution-free future, Oliver Tate’ at the bottom, and puts them in a brown manila envelope. He then searches in his drawer for something. It’s a ‘50p off’ voucher for a Burger Chain. He pops it in.
