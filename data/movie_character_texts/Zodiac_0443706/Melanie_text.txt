125) 2) dialog: Which would make you Robert.
125) 4) dialog: I do.
125) 8) dialog: Just a few minutes. I only just got here- He knocks over a GLASS. Grabs a napkin, dabs up the spill
125) 10) dialog: Glynnis said you were a cartoonist, what were you doing at a gun range?
125) 12) dialog: For her, actually.
125) 14) dialog: Me too. So, the gun range?

125) 25) dialog: I think it's near L.A.
125) 27) dialog: It sounds dangerous.
125) 29) dialog: Well, it's an anonymous tip, right?
125) 31) dialog: So it could be an ambush. It could be Zodiac. Seems kind of stupid.
125) 33) dialog: Oh. Okay. A beat. Melanie picks up her menu.
125) 34) dialog: So, what's good here?
125) 39) dialog: Yes... I'll have the penne vodka, but could you do it in a cream sauce?
125) 41) dialog: (to the waiter) Could you give us another minute? The Waiter departs. Instead of looking at the menu, Graysmith begins searching his pockets.
125) 43) dialog: Do you need to make a phone call?
125) 45) dialog: And stupid.
125) 47) dialog: I have change.
126) 0) text: Graysmith and Melanie, huddled half in and out of a phone booth. Soaked as Graysmith feeds coins into the phone. Th dials. Rotary. It's taking forever.
126) 2) dialog: I don't quite know how to answer that, Robert. He finishes dialing. Finally:

130) 1) dialog: Anything?
130) 3) dialog: Are you kidding? This is the most interesting date I've ever had- THE PHONE RINGS. Graysmith, snatching it up:
177) 3) dialog: "I am not Paul Avery." Graysmith starts. Melanie laughs.
177) 4) dialog: The boys need tuck-ins and the poop machine needs changing.
177) 6) dialog: You wish. (looking at the book) No one has more Zodiac crap than you. Graysmith blinks at this. Looking down at the album. The same name at the top of every article - By Paul Avery.

193) 6) dialog: So you're taking off work?

193) 16) dialog: I'm not sure that's something I want people to know about.
193) 18) dialog: No, Robert, it's in the paper. What's the one thing we know about Zodiac? He reads the newspaper.
199) 5) dialog: Oh, just go. Graysmith bolts out of his chair and rushes into the livi room. The kids follow. ON TV:
204) 0) text: Graysmith, brushing his teeth. Melanie, asleep. The PHONE RINGS. Graysmith runs to pick it up.
206) 0) text: Graysmith gets out of his car to see Melanie hurrying dow the steps, harried. Before he can ask:
206) 1) dialog: You were supposed to pick up the boys from soccer.
206) 3) dialog: They're at the Coes. They tried to call you at work. (CONTINUED)
206) 7) dialog: So I had to leave my work, come home, I'm going to get them right now.
206) 9) dialog: I'm already here, Robert. I'm going. (getting in the car) You have to stop ignoring them.
209) 3) dialog: Why'd you do it? (CONTINUED)
209) 7) dialog: I'm not talking about Linda whoever. You went on TV. You put your face out there for him to see... Graysmith's face falls.
209) 9) dialog: Who's been calling our house? At least once a week and you never let me answer.
209) 11) dialog: Right. A beat. Staring at her. She stares back.
209) 12) dialog: What's it going to take for you to be done with this, Robert?
209) 14) dialog: Well, that's too bad, because we're talking about it. When's it going to be enough? When you catch him? When you arrest him?
209) 16) dialog: I am. Silence. Graysmith, slowly: (CONTINUED)
209) 20) dialog: And that's more important than your family's safety.
209) 22) dialog: Why? (no response) Look at me, Robert. Why?
209) 24) dialog: That's not good enough for me.
221) 6) dialog: You didn't return my calls. Graysmith, stunned to see her.
221) 8) dialog: (looking around) I can see. The book's going well? He doesn't respond. They stare at each other. Two people who no longer know how to act around one another.
221) 9) dialog: I called the Chron...
221) 11) dialog: I heard. When's the last time you ate something?
221) 17) dialog: Did it ever?
221) 19) dialog: Robert. It was just the date that never ended.
221) 21) dialog: No. He just stares at her, numb. Then nods.
221) 22) dialog: But we have a daughter together. You have two good sons. They miss you.
221) 25) dialog: Neither do I. But I will not let you lose them. Do whatever you have to. But finish this. Silence. Melanie turns and walks out. Graysmith sits. Alone. Looking at the MOUNTAINS OF PAPERS. Years of his life, gone. He slowly starts collecting them. Cleaning up Wiping the coffee stained papers off. One, a DMV SHEET on ARTHUR LEIGH ALLEN. And there it is, right at the top. Graysmith stops. STARING at it. And we pull away from him as he stands stock-still rooted to the ground...
