Zagon tries one last surge of strength to save himself; it almost seems he'll wriggle free when: the elbow JOINT SNAPS in half with a sicken- ing sound. ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87 As the joint hangs, dangling grotesquely, Nico reaches up around Zagon's neck, still holding the dangling limb with one arm.
