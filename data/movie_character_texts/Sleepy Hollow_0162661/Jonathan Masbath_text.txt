16) 4) text: I am.  I take my responsibility. The crowd parts as JONATHAN MASBATH, a dirt-poor farmer w a bow and quiver of arrows, moves forward.  His son, YOUN MASBATH, 14, grips his arm.
16) 7) dialog: It is a lottery, son.  It just as easily might have been one of them.
16) 9) dialog: No.  You obey my wishes. (looks to crowd)
16) 10) text: Brom.  Look after him, will you? Brom steps up, nodding.  Jonathan kisses his son's cheek, then heads to the rope ladder.  Men pat him on the back.
16) 13) text: It is problems here on the ground you people need begin to worry about. Ichabod watches Jonathan climb, very high above.
18) 0) text: The torches burn bright.  ABOVE, in the Belltower, Jonath Masbath loads a rifle.  THUNDER BOOMS. Jonathan stands, looking to a sky that is all stars and m A HORSE is HEARD SHRIEKING.  Below, the horse tied at the base of the tower is spooked. A COMMOTION is HEARD, ground rumbling.  Jonathan grips a rifle, cocks it and moves to look... At the forest edge, a herd of deer stampedes out.  They sprint past the tower and across the field. Jonathan crosses to watch the herd scatter.  He crosses b to peer at the forest.  Bad news... A thick FOG creeps from the woods. As the fog overtakes the base of each torch, a tentacle o mist snakes up to the flame, killing it.  All along the forest, arms of vapor snuff torches... one by one by one. Above, Jonathan sights the rifle along the trees.

25) 0) text: Jonathan runs past, gripping his bow.  It's QUIET... till HOOFBEATS are HEARD in pursuit. Trees are silhouetted against the sky.  As HOOFBEATS get LOUDER, branches bend like arms and fingers yearning to touch.  As HOOFBEATS ROAR PAST, the trees relax. FURTHER ON, Jonathan runs.  WIND begins to BLOW. BEHIND, in motion, WE SEE Daredevil's snorting visage; ey lizard-like, with vertical slits literally aglow. The Horseman's hand yanks a wooden WAR HAMMER from a sadd mount.  (No clear view of the Horseman.) HORSEMAN'S P.O.V.: closing in on Jonathan. Jonathan is overtaken.  The Horseman swings the hammer WH -- sends Jonathan sprawling. HOOFBEATS FADE.  Jonathan tries to get up, but pain shoot through him.  He crawls to retrieve his bow. Against a tree, he takes an arrow from his shoulder quive and readies it.  Waiting.  A metal TAPPING is HEARD O.S. CLINK... CLINK... CLINK.  A HORSE SNORTS. Jonathan pulls the bow taut, pained, lips bloody. Elsewhere, Daredevil approaches slow.  The Horseman taps sword on his spur, CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Foliage moves as the Horseman's form pushes through. Jonathan releases -- the arrow WHISTLES... THWACK! -- imbeds in the Horseman's chest. CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... continues -- Jonathan readies second arrow.  Pulls and releases -- O.S. THWACK! CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan cries out, crawling a desperately.  Crawling through underbrush, over roots and rocks.  CLINK... CLINK... CLINK... Jonathan gives up, spe face to the dirt.  He closes his eyes. CLINKING STOPS.  Daredevil halts astride Jonathan; two le on each side of Jonathan's body.
