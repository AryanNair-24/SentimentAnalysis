16) 0) text: TULLY ALFORD, the family attorney, and his wife, MARGARET approach "GATE," a wrought-iron monstrosity that opens of its own accord. Though Tully comes here often and Margaret has been here before, they never cease to be startled by "Gate." Tully has a puffy, once handsome face, and an embittered grey aura that is the mark of a middle-age misspent.

Then, as Tully passes through, Gate slams on him, clipping him and catching the end of his coat. Tully fights Gate for his coat.
