Excavation Ahead!", "Dangerous Undertow!", "Keep Clear! High Voltage!" SAWED-OFF STOP SIGNS, still on their poles, are stacked in the corner. In another corner stands a CYLINDRICAL FLOOR-TO-CEILING FISH TANK, FILLED WITH PIRANHA. This tubby energetic monster of a nine-year-old boy has every chance of growing up to be the public monster his parents would be proud of. He MIXES chemicals in a beaker. The brew steams.    Grin- ning wickedly, Pugsley SWALLOWS it down. He contorts, undergoing the beginnings of a transforma- tion, then SHRINKS to the size of a mouse. Laughing, he crawls out of his human-size pajamas.
