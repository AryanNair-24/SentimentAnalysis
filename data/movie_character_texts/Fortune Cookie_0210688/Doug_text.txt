Hands pick up a tub of long-stemmed, white flowers and ferry them through a kitchen where food preparation has begun. Vegetables are chopped. Woks are t down off hooks. Ducks get stuffed, etc. The hands move through swinging kitchen doors and into an elegant dining room. A slender vase sits in the middle of a plain white tablecloth. The hands insert three of the flowers in the vase, removing offending leaves and fluffing up the arrangement. The camera retreats to reveal a dining room of similarly accoutred tables and satisfied restaurant manager HUE LING. HUE returns through the kitchen doors and picks up a tray pre-cut fortune cookie dough. He holds the tray over his as he, again, navigates the kitchen. He sets it down in f of a frazzled twenty-something-year-old non-Asian, GARRET HENRY.

4) 8) dialog: Yeah? Anyway, I was supposed to be spotting, but I realized that I hadn't painted my nails, so I wandered over to my purse to get the polish--I saw no option--and then I heard this thud followed by all these manic cheerleaders screaming.
4) 10) dialog: I ran back to where I was supposed to be standing, and there was James laying ina pool of blood, staring up, his eyes still open. He looked like that picture in our history book of Robert Kennedy after he had been assassinated. DOUG poses briefly like Robert Kennedy on the floor of th Ambassador Hotel. CAROLYN starts the car, and begins to p out of the lot.

8) 5) dialog: Oh. You realize this is the reason that in the history of civilization no one has ever been able to find a movie at a video store without asking. I think we should start a trend. Let's just alphabetize every last one of them. No more subdividing by category, by country, by star, by director. Every movie in it's place.
8) 7) dialog: (sarcastically) The new issue of Video Entrepreneur came in and you didn't tell me?

8) 13) dialog: You've been going out, what, a year?
8) 15) dialog: Well I want to know what his intentions are. He's a great guy. You're crazy about him. I'm tired of you two having to sneak around behind my back. I don't see what the hold up is here.
8) 17) dialog: He's a vampire, a bloodsucking prince of darkness. I had a feeling he was too good to be true.
8) 19) dialog: The thing is...
8) 21) dialog: And how do you feel about it?
8) 25) dialog: Are you doing something with him tonight?
8) 27) dialog: Don't remind me.
8) 29) dialog: I think I'm going to call him and tell him I can't go. Help me think of something. Hey, you said you wanted to start staying open late. Let's start tonight. I'll work.
8) 31) dialog: I don't know him. I don't know why he asked me. I was just too shocked to think of anything to say except yes. God, everybody in school knows I'm single, and Troy's already asked a freshman--A FRESHMAN--to the dance. Most of the time, if I have a clue somebody likes me who I don't want to go out with, I can manage to avoid being alone with him, or I'll already have an excuse--a good one-- just right there, ready, you know. At the tip of my tongue. This guy tricked me. He gave none of the usual preliminary signs.

God, Troy, you want your cake and you want to eat it too. ..Yeah, but if you ate it, you wouldn't have it any more. Forget it, Troy, it's an expression. Just a second, I've got a calling coming in.

46) 1) dialog: I think it took me until eighth grade to completely figure out boys. Then, once I had, I was embarrassed it took me that long. I mean, they're that simple. What I figured out was that, if you want one, you make him the center of the universe. Everything revolves around him. His day. His football practice. The little bruise on his elbow. The kind of car he wants to drive someday. Then, during my sophomore year--I think it was pretty soon after my boyfriend at the time, Bobby Snowden, missed my Dad's funeral because of an Aerosmith concert--I decided I wanted the world to revolve around me.

47) 11) dialog: Why did you say you wanted to come here?
47) 13) dialog: Look, could we trade seats?
47) 15) dialog: Thanks. The pair gets up and changes seats. The process is awkwar All the dishes and glasses have to be traded as well. Onc the process is complete, it's clear that DOUG is looking HEATH'S shoulder while they're talking.
47) 17) dialog: Sorry?
47) 21) dialog: Dean's spare glass eye? I think it's really a ring which means he's going to pop the question to Mom tonight, and I want to see her reaction if he does.
47) 23) dialog: Yes. I'm almost positive.
47) 25) dialog: I wish I had a video camera.

52) 4) dialog: So what made you become a vegetarian? DOUG shovels in an especially large morsel of meat.
52) 6) dialog: I mean, do you just not like meat? Or do you not believe in killing animals? Or are you just into the health factor?
52) 8) dialog: So what happened? Did you get locked in a slaughterhouse or something?
52) 10) dialog: What?
52) 12) dialog: Try me.
52) 15) dialog: You were in that class?
52) 19) dialog: Mine was from France. I think I wrote her twice.
52) 21) dialog: Wow, really? And he convinced you to become a vegetarian?
52) 23) dialog: Well, doesn't that balance out? Wouldn't we be eating that grain if we weren't eating those cows?

57) 7) dialog: Square dancing: has anything ever been named so perfectly?
57) 9) dialog: Yeah.

62) 1) dialog: No, you see, that's the thing that drives my Mom nuts. I have no ambition. There's no great thing I want to do. I don't want to run a corporation or dance on Broadway. I want to be an absorber. See the world. Take things in.
62) 5) dialog: I'll look in the paper for any openings for absorbers.
62) 7) dialog: But that's not absorbing. That's the opposite of absorbing--things going out instead of things coming in.
62) 9) dialog: Right.
62) 11) dialog: I told you. But it's not like I mind working, you know--waiting tables, dealing blackjack, bottlecapping at a brewery.
62) 13) dialog: I just have a more European way of thinking about it. You know, where you work to live rather than live to work
62) 15) dialog: No, like the Spanish or Italians. Work for a couple hours in the morning. Take a three hour lunch, maybe a nap. Sunbathe. Come back to work for a couple hours in the afternoon.
62) 19) dialog: You don't approve. You think I sound hedonistic.
62) 22) dialog: So what about you? Do you have ambition.
62) 24) dialog: Doing what?
62) 26) dialog: Oh we are talking big bucks.
62) 28) dialog: Racism, poverty...
62) 30) dialog: I was going to say that.

62) 36) dialog: Do you know the deal with the fortune cookies here?
62) 38) dialog: (adopting a very serious tone) They always come true. No, just kidding. But they are supposed to be original. They write a new one for everyone who comes in.
62) 40) dialog: What does yours say?
62) 42) dialog: That's just weird.
62) 44) dialog: (reading) What do these things have in common: lawnmower, revolving door, sap? HEATH shrugs. DOUG shakes her head in wonder. Fortune Cookie - 70.

68) 2) dialog: It's not just that. They didn't look happy.
68) 4) dialog: Yeah, but you should see them together most of the time. It's like they can't keep their hands off each other. It always embarrasses Troy. The present tense mention of Troy seems to bother HEATH.
68) 5) dialog: I'm sorry. That's rude. (CONTINUED )
68) 9) dialog: Well Dean's cool. And I want Mom to be happy.
68) 11) dialog: Different from what.
68) 13) dialog: What stereotype?
68) 15) dialog: In case you were wondering. I'm not taking this as a compliment.
68) 17) dialog: What makes you think I don't? Because I danced with your friend in junior high?
68) 21) dialog: Let's not.
68) 23) dialog: Let's not go to the dance.
68) 25) dialog: I just don't feel like it.
68) 27) dialog: Have you ever been to these things? The band is always lame. It costs too much. A bunch of drunks stepping on your feet.
68) 29) dialog: We could do something else. HEATH sighs and shakes his head.
68) 31) dialog: It's not... (CONTINUED )
68) 35) dialog: Just take me home.
70) 0) text: Return to DOUG'S interview scene.
70) 1) dialog: Mom doesn't know this, but I did go out with a college guy for a couple months. I think those were the months right after my lobotomy. The only difference I could ever figure out is that he didn't ask me to wear his letter jacket. The thing about guys--and I can't decide if this is a minus or a plus--is that they're predictable. You know exactly what they're going to do.
71) 0) text: HEATH and DOUG ride in silence.
71) 1) dialog: Heath, I want to tell you something. First of all, I wouldn't be embarrassed to go to the dance with you. Not at all. When we left tonight. I had every intention of going through with it.
71) 3) dialog: I don't mean it like that. The truth is, Troy called me before you came to pick me up. He wants to get back together--after tonight. He already had a date.
71) 5) dialog: No. That's not it. I was going to make him jealous. To punish him. To show everyone I wasn't just sitting around waiting for him to come back to me. And I was using you to do that. And that was okay when you were just some guy I didn't (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
71) 9) dialog: On what?
71) 11) dialog: Good strategy.
71) 13) dialog: About the dance?
71) 15) dialog: You got too real.
71) 17) dialog: I don't have to be home yet.
71) 19) dialog: You pick.
80) 4) dialog: Hello. ELLEN sets HEATH'S drink down.
80) 6) dialog: Strawberry Smoothie?
80) 8) dialog: I can get something else.
80) 13) dialog: You must come here a lot.
80) 15) dialog: Mmhhhmmm. HEATH leads DOUG to two high-back antique chairs that fac liver shaped vintage coffee table and a puffy couch. Displayed on the wall above this conglomeration is Heath' piece d'art--a 3D cityscape fashioned out of painted boxe various size and shape, toy soldiers, Weebles, model trai Hot Wheels, etc. Everything is cemented down. It hangs li normal, if bulky, painting. HEATH gives DOUG the chair wi the better view of the work.
80) 16) dialog: (noticing the piece) Whoa, funky.
80) 18) dialog: (pausing for serious consideration) Funky good. This won't match anyone's couch.
80) 20) dialog: You did this?
80) 22) dialog: Very cool. Is there a theme, some special meaning?
80) 26) dialog: Yeah.
80) 28) dialog: Good.
80) 30) dialog: What?
80) 32) dialog: Wobbling the Weebles.
80) 34) dialog: I told him I would.

82) 6) dialog: I can't believe they let him do that.
82) 8) dialog: Devious.
82) 10) dialog: They're on when I'm working, so I don't take them home very often. Besides, if there's a movie in the house, it's too easy not to do my homework.
82) 12) dialog: Well, I have this secret goal. I got two B's my freshman year, but I haven't made any since.
82) 16) dialog: The rest have been A's.
82) 18) dialog: If I get A's the rest of the year, I'll be the salutatorian.
82) 20) dialog: No. I understand. That's the secret part. I don't want anyone to know. I never tell anyone what I made on tests or homework or what I got in a class. I don't even think Troy knows. And it's not that I'm all that smart; my SATs prove that. I just work hard at it.
82) 22) dialog: Ambition to make good grades seems kind of pointless if there's nothing you really want to do with it, but the scholarship money will come in handy.
82) 24) dialog: Because it's so uncool. Not to be smart, really, but to try really hard for something. You say one of the reasons you asked me to the dance was because you didn't think I fit some stereotype, but in a lot of ways, I do. Look at me. I'ma cheerleader who dates a football player and doesn't want anyone to think she's has a brain.
89) 0) text: DOUG and HEATH sit on the couch, a safe distance between them. They watch The African Queen.
89) 2) dialog: Yeah, you'd have World War One and the depression to look forward to.
89) 4) dialog: Mom? What's wrong? Are you okay?
89) 6) dialog: Something happened with Dean?
89) 8) dialog: Moving away? (CONTINUED )
89) 12) dialog: Then what was the ring for? Who gives a ‘breaking up' ring?
89) 14) dialog: He had a ring. It fell out of his pocket before he picked you up. I saw it. I thought he was going to pop the question tonight. That's why we went to The Empire. I wanted to see your expression when he asked you.
89) 16) dialog: He asked you? What did you say?
89) 18) dialog: Mom... CAROLYN stands. She takes the phone down off the wall and begins to dial. Deciding against that plan of action, she hangs it back up. She repeats that process. She picks up purse, then sets it back down again. Terribly confused, s sits.
89) 19) dialog: Go.
89) 21) dialog: Tell him not to go.
89) 25) dialog: I think you better. CAROLYN gets her purse and heads back out of the kitchen, through the living room and out of the front door. DOUG follows her into the living room.
89) 26) dialog: (shouting after her mom) I won't wait up. CAROLYN pops her head back in the door.
89) 28) dialog: But Mom, that doesn't give us enough time to watch... CAROLYN shuts the door.
89) 29) dialog: Caligula
89) 31) dialog: Why would she be mad?
89) 33) dialog: Oh yeah, that. She won't care. Hey, you paused the movie.
89) 35) dialog: Wow. You're the first male of the species I've ever known to pause the movie when somebody else leaves the room. Embarrassed, HEATH finishes his sentence. (CONTINUED )
89) 39) dialog: I'm glad you asked me out. I've needed to meet someone like you.
89) 41) dialog: You took dance lessons?
89) 43) dialog: Let's see it. Show me what you've learned.
89) 47) dialog: Type three?
89) 51) dialog: Type four...
89) 53) dialog: 
89) 55) dialog: You're not going to cut off your ear and mail it to me, are you?
89) 57) dialog: All right--immortality. They dance for a moment.
89) 59) dialog: A lawnmower. A revolving door.
89) 61) dialog: Oh wow. I wasn't thinking of it that way. What do you think it's supposed to mean?
89) 63) dialog: Who knows. DOUG draws in closer to HEATH. (CONTINUED )
89) 66) dialog: I guess this would be type two.
89) 68) dialog: So what's type one like?
89) 70) dialog: You know what would be funny?
89) 72) dialog: If, on Monday, we walked through the cafeteria holding hands.
89) 74) dialog: Yeah, I think it would.
