6) 2) dialog: Uh, that one. The SALES CLERK withdraws the ring from the case and hand to DEAN. DEAN examines the dangling price tag. A look of concern passes across his face.
6) 4) dialog: What?
6) 6) dialog: Who do you suppose came up with that rule?
6) 8) dialog: Well--and this is only a theory--but I suspect that whoever decided that three month's salary was the rule was sitting on your side of the counter. (CONTINUED )
6) 12) dialog: I think they were in cahoots with whoever invented Secretaries Day.
6) 14) dialog: I have a question. The SALES CLERK stares at DEAN who remains uncomfortable.
6) 15) dialog: Can you return them?
6) 17) dialog: Um.. Do you.. I mean... Is there...
6) 19) dialog: Do people laugh? Point and stare?
6) 21) dialog: I'll take it.
6) 23) dialog: I'll be using my first born.

31) 2) dialog: Hey, Kiddo. Bowling tonight?
31) 4) dialog: Is your mom ready?
31) 6) dialog: Actually, with our dates, it's tough to tell the difference.
31) 11) dialog: Hi. None of the pretty girls willing to go with you? HEATH laughs nervously.
31) 14) dialog: Maybe you'll be able to get some homework done tonight. DEAN reaches out to shake Heath's hand. When he does, the ring box falls out of the jacket he's carrying. He stuffs back in his pocket quickly, but not before DOUG notices.
31) 15) dialog: (upon box retrieval, shaking Heath's hand) Sorry about that. Never know when you're going to need that spare glass eye. Good to meet you.
31) 18) dialog: (calling after them) Have fun. DEAN knocks on the door while opening it up.
32) 0) text: DEAN enters the house.
32) 1) dialog: Hi, honey. I'm home. DEAN plops down on the couch and kicks his feet up on an ottoman. CAROLYN enters room with a cordless phone presse her ear. She nods at DEAN, but continues the conversation (CONTINUED )
32) 5) dialog: Big day at the office.
32) 7) dialog: Naw, you wouldn't want to hear about it.
32) 9) dialog: Okay, Okay. They want me to head up the new software division.
32) 11) dialog: And, from what I understand, San Francisco is a beautiful city.
32) 13) dialog: Good weather. Fancy rice dishes.
32) 15) dialog: Great restaurants. CAROLYN clicks the phone off emphatically.
32) 17) dialog: We're going to one. You ready? Fortune Cookie - 28.
35) 0) text: CAROLYN drives DEAN to the restaurant. (CONTINUED )
35) 4) dialog: Mention what?
35) 6) dialog: Oh. You mean the stripper who came in and sang happy anniversary to me in the middle of a staff meeting.
35) 8) dialog: Boy, I sure wasted a lot of dollar bills, then. And, once again, you one-upped me.
35) 11) dialog: Honey, that light was red.
44) 0) text: CAROLYN and DEAN haven't even picked up their menus yet.
44) 2) dialog: Six Figures.
44) 4) dialog: Iowa.
44) 6) dialog: Yeah, I'll be The Man.
44) 8) dialog: I'll say. But it's not a done deal yet.
44) 10) dialog: They've offered it, but I'm playing it cool, which for an accountant means I'm not high-fiving anyone in the hallways.
44) 12) dialog: There are other considerations.
44) 16) dialog: Could you get us a bottle of wine, please?
44) 21) dialog: What yard line my 49ers season tickets will be on.
48) 0) text: DEAN'S cubicle has photographs tacked up around it. Most of little league teams he has coached, but there's also a large one of CAROLYN, and a small, school-picture-sized o of DOUG.
48) 1) dialog: You know how, sometimes, something that just starts as a little misunderstanding gets repeated and changed so much, that it becomes, like, a new reality. That's what's happened with the story of my near wedding. I was twenty-seven at the time, and I had been dating this woman for seven years. All of our friends thought (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
49) 0) text: CAROLYN and DEAN finish giving LU their order.
49) 7) dialog: I've got it.
49) 9) dialog: I know where I've met Doug's date.
49) 11) dialog: Ann's date. I coached him. It must have been eight or nine years ago.
49) 15) dialog: Played him in right field.
49) 17) dialog: Least skill-intensive position. Frequent spaz repository.
49) 19) dialog: But I know why I remember him now. I mean, I've coached a lot of kids. But there was this play, I don't think I'll ever forget. Something you just don't see in most lifetimes. We were in the playoffs, and we were into extra innings. We had a one run lead, but whoever we were playing had runners at second and third with two outs. Their batter hits a line shot out to right. I figure the game is over. That kid, Heath, he did have some speed, but he couldn't catch a cold. Anyway, he runs this fly ball down, dives...
49) 21) dialog: Well that's what it looked like from where I was sitting. And from where the ump was to, because he called the batter out which meant we won. So everyone is celebrating. The team is throwing their hats in the air, and I spot Heath talking to the umpire. The next thing I know, we've lost the game.
49) 23) dialog: He's told the umpire that he trapped the ball. He didn't catch it on the fly, so the two runners scored.
49) 27) dialog: No, I've always admired him. I don't think I've ever seen an eight-year-old do anything more noble. If I ever have a child, I hope, well first off, I hope he has better hands, but after that, I hope he's got balls that big.
55) 0) text: DEAN and CAROLYN ignore their food. They hold hands acros the table.
55) 1) dialog: I don't know if I ever told you this, but you were supposed to be Gerald's account.
55) 5) dialog: No, that's Albert. Gerald's the one who does that dance, the deduction dance, right at midnight every April fifteenth. He uses staplers as castanets.
55) 7) dialog: I saw you. You were in our lobby. Apparently some old timer waiting next to you suggested you not make any financial decisions without consulting your husband first. As I walked through, you were listing orifices in which he might have better luck introducing his theory. Gerald was next in line for new accounts, but I traded him the Madison Beer Garden account for the privilege of working with the lovely and vocal proprietress of Les Video.
55) 9) dialog: I'm a big believer in long-term, consistent performers.
55) 11) dialog: Uh, Babe. That wasn't sweetness. That was fear.
55) 13) dialog: Let's see. You're easy. Twenty years from now you'll be retired--if you keep putting that money into tax-sheltered annuities like I told you. There'll be little Les Video franchises across the state. You'll live in a lake house, spoil your grandchildren. (CONTINUED )
55) 17) dialog: Oh, Carolyn, you can have anyone you want. 57
59) 0) text: DEAN continues his interview.
59) 1) dialog: When you're counting down the days until you hit forty and you still haven't been married, you can't help but hear the whispers. I know what they're saying, "He sure is patient." "What a full life he must lead to not need a woman in it." I can't lie. It hurts. Actually, the mistake people usually make is that they think any guy who makes it this long is too picky or fears commitment, but that's not me at all. I fear ending up with the wrong person. I really want to get this right the first time.
60) 0) text: DEAN and CAROLYN continue ignoring their food. (CONTINUED )
60) 3) dialog: We'll rack up a bunch of frequent flyer miles. It won't be so bad. A couple weekends a month--we could do that.
60) 5) dialog: "Hot little number?" Is that an accountant joke.
60) 7) dialog: You're being bad.
60) 9) dialog: Then what do you propose?
60) 11) dialog: How sad?
60) 15) dialog: How sad? I mean, if I got down on my knee right here, handed you a ring, what would you say?
60) 17) dialog: Then who are we kidding?
63) 0) text: The food in front of DEAN and CAROLYN is half-eaten and getting cold.
63) 1) dialog: So let me get this straight. You don't even think there's a point in trying it out, seeing if we could make it work. I don't think that's fair.
63) 3) dialog: Well the first thing that's not fair, is that you're saying it won't work out because I'll be too busy or that I'll find someone new. You're the busiest woman I know. Sorry, the busiest person. You never slow down, and it's this curse, that all the things that I love about you- -the way you save receipts when we go to movies so you can write them off; the way that, when you get an idea in your head for the store, you can go ten minutes without hearing a word I say; even the way you fax me love notes--these same things are what will keep us apart.
63) 5) dialog: You would never sell that store.
63) 7) dialog: I'm not asking you to. My point is, it's more than a store for you. It's validation. Proof that you can make it without a husband. Well I think you've proved it to yourself and to your in- laws. You said yourself, you don't see pity on their faces anymore. So who are you proving it to now? Blockbuster is offering you enough money that you could open a new store, twice the size anywhere you wanted... (CONTINUED )
63) 11) dialog: For a few more months. Still, you act like the offer is an insult.
63) 13) dialog: What are your views on love? This is where LU approaches the table to clear dishes.
63) 18) dialog: Maybe we should have talked about this earlier, but, what I'm saying is, where does love rank? We say it all the time. "I love you." For some people it's this consuming thing. It's like a drug, makes them think in sonnet form. For some people it's companionship and comfort. Where does it stand with you?
63) 20) dialog: Maybe it should have been a first date question. (CONTINUED )
63) 24) dialog: I still want to know. I think I need to know.
63) 26) dialog: How high?
63) 29) dialog: Where in comparison to the free enterprise system?
63) 31) dialog: But I'm serious. Where do we rank in comparison to your store.
63) 33) dialog: So if both the store and me caught on fire, and you only had one bucket of water... (CONTINUED )
69) 0) text: The dishes have been cleared away from in front of CAROLY and DEAN. The check and the fortune cookies sit untouched a small tray beside them.
69) 1) dialog: So that's it. I guess I'll tell them I'll take it.
69) 3) dialog: They want me out there in a month.
69) 5) dialog: I don't think so.
69) 7) dialog: One year. It has a certain mathematical perfection to it.
69) 9) dialog: So what do you want to do?
69) 11) dialog: I have no idea. I haven't been there for.. (CONTINUED )
69) 15) dialog: Yeah, that's right. A year.

77) 5) dialog: Now I mean it! I will devour you! Laughing, CAROLYN attempts to hold DEAN'S hand. DEAN (cont'd) Watch it sister. That's a little friendly for a first date, don't you think?
77) 7) dialog: Why's that? Do you have some unwholesome memories you want to share?
77) 9) dialog: Not for me. My oldest brother used to take all five us here when we were kids. I'll always think of drive-ins as John Wayne, Coke down my shorts, and a trip to the swing set when the kissing started.
77) 11) dialog: My punctuality?
77) 13) dialog: I'm an accountant. Of course I didn't whine. (CONTINUED )
77) 17) dialog: Now, in all fairness to those weenies you went out with before, it is a tough call. I mean, I asked you out. It only stands to reason that I should pay.
77) 19) dialog: You asked me if I could come over to go over your books with you. That's not a date.
77) 21) dialog: You asked me if I liked Pringles. I'm the one who suggested we make a night of it.
77) 23) dialog: Do you think I should let my buddies out of the trunk yet.
83) 0) text: The drive in parking lot is empty except for CAROLYN'S ca The movie is over. CAROLYN is asleep against Dean's shoul DEAN is awake and staring blankly at the screen.

83) 2) dialog: You missed it. The swamp monster managed to organize all the textile workers into a union.
83) 4) dialog: What lake house.
83) 6) dialog: Was it nice?
83) 8) dialog: Where to now?
83) 10) dialog: I had forgotten about that.
83) 14) dialog: I remembered halfway through the movie that it was Atilla The Mom's birthday. DEAN and CAROLYN both realize.
83) 15) dialog: Shit.
83) 17) dialog: Yeah, methodically clipping my face out of every family photo.
88) 0) text: DEAN is leaning on his Suburban. He's talking to his moth on a cellular phone. CAROLYN is close enough that she can hear what he's saying.

88) 4) dialog: Sorry. Her opinions are her own and don't reflect those of her offspring.
88) 6) dialog: Do you want to come over?
88) 8) dialog: So this is it.
88) 10) dialog: A month.
88) 12) dialog: That's no good. I'm one of those people who likes to rip the band aid off, not peel it off slowly. It doesn't hurt as long that way.
88) 14) dialog: Anything you need. Ever. Just call.

93) 4) dialog: You don't get to ask that question. It's mine. I bought a ring and everything. DEAN produces the ring.
93) 6) dialog: I'm still shaking. Carolyn, the backwards way I asked earlier--I deserved a no.
93) 10) dialog: Marry me.
