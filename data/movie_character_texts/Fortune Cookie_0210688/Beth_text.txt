2) 6) dialog: She might expect you to. Here. I'm going to stop, and you take over. After an awkward moment, the two resume the dance.

2) 10) dialog: We're doing what is commonly known among the female sex as type four dancing. (CONTINUED )
2) 14) dialog: Perhaps. Notice the signs. We could fit a third person between us. My hands rest lightly and significantly above your hip bone. I'm staring not at you, but at the cute basketball player across the dance floor.
2) 16) dialog: Utter disinterest.
2) 18) dialog: OK, type three. Friendlier. Room to chat without bumping noses, but the invisible wall is still there. She's reserving judgement, but you've got her attention.
2) 20) dialog: Who is this girl anyway?
2) 22) dialog: That's poetic.
2) 24) dialog: And I assume she's been making a fool of herself pursuing you.
2) 29) dialog: Pretty gutsy.
2) 32) dialog: (ignoring him) Here's where you'll want to slide your hands down to the middle of her back. Unless they're sweaty. If they're sweaty, put ‘em on her hips ..on her jeans where she won't notice.
2) 34) dialog: Whoa, Tiger. We don't even have the training wheels off yet. So what made this girl say yes if she didn't know who you were?
2) 36) dialog: And like a circling buzzard, my brother...
2) 38) dialog: A class act. The pair type-two dances for a few more seconds. (CONTINUED )
2) 42) dialog: Well let's hope she doesn't expect to be dipped.
2) 44) dialog: Uh, I have a date.
2) 46) dialog: His name is Trent. He works at that radio station you and all your little skinhead buddies listen to.
2) 48) dialog: I do?
2) 50) dialog: He seemed nice.
2) 52) dialog: He's in my book club.
2) 56) dialog: It's just dinner.
2) 58) dialog: It probably won't amount to anything.
2) 60) dialog: Lay off, Heath.
2) 62) dialog: If I ever see Daniel again, I'll tell him it's over between the two of you.

17) 2) dialog: You know the plan?
17) 4) dialog: Should I set an alarm?
17) 6) dialog: Let's see. Am I forgetting anything?
17) 8) dialog: Oh yeah. When you go to the store, could you pick me up a pint of Ben & Jerry's?
17) 10) dialog: You got it. 19 20 21 22 23 Fortune Cookie - 18.

29) 2) dialog: (concerned) I don't look ready?
29) 5) dialog: Yeah, let's go.
29) 7) dialog: Thanks. BETH holds the flower self-consciously trying to decide whether she should carry it or leave it in a vase. TRENT notices. (CONTINUED )
29) 12) dialog: Thank you, Miss Manners.
33) 0) text: TRENT and BETH drive to the restaurant.
33) 2) dialog: No.
33) 4) dialog: This thing?
33) 6) dialog: That's hygienic. Do you remember what it said?
33) 8) dialog: And was it?
33) 10) dialog: God, I hate that.
33) 12) dialog: It said "loneness"--not loneliness?
33) 16) dialog: I don't know if I like that. I mean, loneliness is bad--we can all agree on that--but I'm not sure "loneness" is.
33) 18) dialog: I'm very content by myself.
37) 0) text: BETH is stretched out on the grass, a book bag nearby.
37) 1) dialog: There are a number of horrors I prefer to dating, balancing my checkbook, getting a pap smear, watching Saturday Night Live. First of all, I'm not very good at it. Dating, that is. I always say the wrong thing. I know you're supposed to act a certain way, but I can never make myself do it. You know, appearing entranced by every detail of his life or being impressed because he's in a band or owns a boat.
38) 0) text: TRENT is talking to BETH over wine.
38) 3) dialog: Uh huh.
38) 5) dialog: No, finish. What do you do?

38) 15) dialog: Yeah. The conversation comes to
38) 19) dialog: The what?
38) 21) dialog: We're giving up on natural conversational flow this early. BETH looks at her watch and gives TRENT a playful express of concern.
38) 23) dialog: How do you play?
38) 25) dialog: 
38) 28) dialog: Sounds challenging.
38) 30) dialog: Can we play a sample round?
38) 35) dialog: Tasteless?
38) 37) dialog: Give me a second. BETH drums her fingers on the table and thinks.
38) 38) dialog: Let's see, the human heart, like an edible garnish, tempts the hungry who, but then chew it up and, having tasted its fruit--no make that essence--, spit it out.
38) 40) dialog: You do, huh? Let's create a window into your psyche. Glancing around, BETH notices a snuggly couple at a nearb table.
38) 41) dialog: How about love and ..The Empire.
38) 43) dialog: Or that crumbles into dust?
38) 45) dialog: That's what Amanda--she's my roommate-- calls me. What about you? You sound awfully optimistic. "Love conquers all"-- how have you managed to keep living that lie. (CONTINUED )
38) 49) dialog: Push ups with Santa Claus. Step class with the Easter Bunny? Wait a minute. I know you. You're the guy who's never been in love. I've heard he existed, but I never thought I'd be going out to dinner with him.
38) 51) dialog: (singing) You've never been in love. You've never been in love...
38) 53) dialog: Thought so.
38) 55) dialog: Not soul, necessarily, but insight. Yeah.
38) 57) dialog: I'm just saying, one of his spent a few nights in Heartbreak Hotel, one of us hasn't. I tell you, it makes you appreciate your own bed. BETH notices HEATH and DOUG walking into the restaurant.
38) 58) dialog: Oh my God. My brother's here. I'm going to go say hi. (CONTINUED )
38) 61) dialog: (to Heath) Pardon me for sounding forward, but you are quite possibly the most attractive man I've seen in my life.
38) 63) dialog: Hi, nice to meet you.
38) 65) dialog: Heath and Doug, this is Trent.
38) 66) dialog: Hi.
38) 69) dialog: So what are you doing here? I thought all your friends were going to Louie's.
40) 8) dialog: Beth.
45) 0) text: TRENT and BETH have their meals in front of them. TRENT u chopsticks, expertly. BETH observes this feat with a mixt of awe and suspicion.
45) 1) dialog: You're scaring me.
45) 3) dialog: The rose. You ordered the wine in French. You're like Edward Scissorhands with those chopsticks. Next, I'm afraid you're going to stick this flower in your mouth and tell me you know how to tango.
45) 5) dialog: Trent Kennedy, are you a player? (CONTINUED )
45) 9) dialog: Player like Warren Beatty calls you for advice.
45) 11) dialog: Suave is your job?
45) 13) dialog: You go out a lot?
45) 15) dialog: Full moons. Usually I'll line up someone to watch Haley's Comet with me.
45) 17) dialog: Oh it comes in stages. You start with infatuation. You hear yourself saying things like, "Sure, I'd love to go see Pat Metheney with you."
45) 19) dialog: Wait a minute. This is still the good part. For an all-too-brief splendorous blip in time, it hits you. You feel complete for the first time ever ..even though you didn't know you were missing anything. Every song on the radio becomes "Ode to The Two of Us." You're not sure if the planet has continued to spin outside of your bedroom. You burn through more candles than the Little House On The Prairie. You have playful arguments over whether to name your unconceived daughter (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
45) 23) dialog: Until one day, one of you wakes up and decides it's not right. It's not perfect. It's time to move on. BETH stops abruptly and takes a drink of water.
45) 25) dialog: That's from lack of oxygen. Side-effect of rushing in where angels fear to tread.
53) 0) text: TRENT and BETH are finishing up their meals.
53) 2) dialog: Ladder of Years, I think. It's the newest Ann Tyler book. Have you read it?
53) 4) dialog: I am impressed. I can't believe you're the same guy who calls people at six in the morning pretending to be a sex-toy salesman.
53) 6) dialog: Forgive me. I'm still surprised.
53) 8) dialog: Not that you can read, that you're well- read. There's a big difference.
53) 13) dialog: Bees?
53) 15) dialog: I don't think bee-phobia qualifies you for "complicated childhood" status.
53) 17) dialog: Meemaw?
53) 19) dialog: Queen mother.
53) 23) dialog: You were afraid of dragonflies? That's why you became an avid reader? (CONTINUED )
53) 27) dialog: The Hobbit is a great book. There is an awkward pause.
53) 28) dialog: I mean it. A classic. LU, wearing an expression of amusement, takes the plates into the kitchen.
56) 0) text: The check and the fortune cookies have arrived on TRENT a BETH'S table.
56) 2) dialog: I thought you weren't supposed to tell anyone.
56) 4) dialog: So?
56) 6) dialog: Yeah...
56) 8) dialog: I always thought you were supposed to add “after sex." TRENT reads to himself.
56) 10) dialog: Yes it does. Think of after as a verb, not an adverb. (CONTINUED )
56) 14) dialog: Mine's bizarre.
56) 16) dialog: (reading) Abba Gold thirteen colon four.
56) 18) dialog: If I read it, do you think I'll be Bjorn again?
61) 0) text: TRENT and BETH ride in TRENT'S car.
61) 1) dialog: Another game?
61) 3) dialog: A sport? Gee, Pops, I'll try.
61) 5) dialog: Shoot.
61) 7) dialog: I don't suppose Ralph Fiennes is behind curtain number three.
61) 9) dialog: I don't like these choices. I don't like what either one of them says about me. But I see what you're doing. They're so (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
61) 13) dialog: Stallone and Woody Allen?
61) 15) dialog: Mia Farrow is a hot babe?
61) 17) dialog: Who even says "hot babe?"
61) 19) dialog: Fine company you're keeping. TRENT begins singing the Jeopardy music.
61) 20) dialog: You're still expecting an answer? He reaches the conclusion of the tune.
61) 21) dialog: Okay, Stallone.
61) 23) dialog: Speaking of which, where are we heading right now? (CONTINUED )
61) 27) dialog: Planet Hollywood, I guess. Where are we going?
61) 29) dialog: Hold on. Time out. We're going where?
61) 31) dialog: Oh? And I had completely forgotten--I'm expecting a call from my grandmother. Maybe you ought to drop me off. Do we have a few minutes before Rover goes into cardiac arrest?

65) 8) dialog: Chivalry is not dead. (CONTINUED )
66) 0) text: We return to BETH'S interview scene.
66) 1) dialog: I think my problem, on dates, is that I think of them as automatically confrontational. Let's face it, guys have a different set of goals by which they measure a date's success. I've been thinking about giving up on men. Maybe become romantically linked with, say, my refrigerator, or follow Amanda's advice and find love online. At least at the end of the evening, I won't have to hear the phrase, "I'll call you." Translation-- we'll bump into each other several months from now, you'll be wearing sweats and have a cold sore, and I'll introduce you to my new supermodel fiance.
67) 2) dialog: Okay, that's enough. (CONTINUED )
67) 6) dialog: So you're a jewelry consultant. Very impressive.
67) 8) dialog: There's a term for that. BETH continues examining the book collection
67) 9) dialog: Norman Mailer? You like Norman Mailer.
67) 11) dialog: As far as corny, narcissistic, adolescent- sounding, sexist writers full of glib schtick on highbrow topics, he's not bad. Oh look, you have his entire oeuvre.
67) 13) dialog: What's wrong with Ann Tyler?
67) 15) dialog: Where is this phantom dog of yours? Here Rover! Here Rover! TRENT returns to the living room with an obviously sick kitten wrapped in a blanket.
67) 19) dialog: I think it's against some law, naming a cat Rover. Fines are involved.
67) 21) dialog: (suspiciously) RoVAIR?
67) 23) dialog: What do I need to do?
67) 25) dialog: Like this?
67) 29) dialog: Sweet trip. How old is he? (CONTINUED )
67) 33) dialog: You have every Doctor Seuss book.

73) 7) dialog: What was her name?
73) 9) dialog: Kinky. Returning her attention to the book shelves.
73) 10) dialog: You know, most of the time, I don't mind being a destitute graduate student. I just don't need that much money to be happy, but this makes me jealous. All my books have due dates stamped inside.
73) 12) dialog: I love that store.
73) 14) dialog: A Prayer For Owen Meaney--This is my favorite book of all time. (CONTINUED )
73) 18) dialog: (opening book, reading) "Mr. Dead, Read less. Live more. John Irving." Wow.
73) 21) dialog: A promo?
73) 23) dialog: You don't strike me as the DJ-type, Trent.
73) 25) dialog: I just figured DJs were obnoxious all the time. On air and off air.
73) 29) dialog: Uh.
73) 31) dialog: Yeah, can I?
73) 33) dialog: Great. Which way?
73) 35) dialog: Thanks.
74) 0) text: BETH sits on the edge of TRENT'S bed to use the phone. Sh does actually glance at the ceiling to make sure there is mirror on it. The candles above the bed visibly concern h She dials.
74) 1) dialog: It's me.
75) 2) dialog: Yeah, okay, thanks.
75) 4) dialog: I probably should...
75) 8) dialog: He has his own copy of Horton Hears A Hoo.
75) 10) dialog: Couldn't be helped.

81) 6) dialog: Their favorite movies?
81) 10) dialog: My favorite movie?
81) 12) dialog: Guess.
81) 15) dialog: Please.
81) 19) dialog: So what's yours? American Gigolo?
81) 21) dialog: So what is it?
81) 23) dialog: Not so fast, pal. Favorite flick. Let's hear it.
81) 27) dialog: After the way I've laid my soul bare to you tonight. So, what does that leave us with? Are we back to first date word games?
81) 29) dialog: Really? I don't mean to; it's just that your stories--I don't know--the way they come out; they sound rehearsed. Maybe rehearsed is a bit harsh. It sounds like you're even tired of telling them. I know everyone has stories that they repeat all the time, but...
81) 31) dialog: I don't. It's too easy. It's like going on dating autopilot. One story to show you're strong. One story to show you're sensitive. One story to show you've got a sense of humor.
81) 33) dialog: There has to be something more to it. I mean, what happens when you run out of stories?
84) 0) text: BETH and TRENT sit in TRENT'S parked car.
84) 1) dialog: I don't see how you do it. You're not even going to get five hours of sleep.
84) 3) dialog: Well thanks. I had a nice time.
85) 0) text: BETH pulls at her door handle and starts to get out of th car. TRENT quickly follows suit. The two converse while moving towards the door.
85) 2) dialog: I'm fine, really.
85) 7) dialog: Sure.
85) 9) dialog: Why?
85) 11) dialog: Oh. I don't think that'll work.
85) 13) dialog: My clock alarm--that's all it is. No radio.
85) 15) dialog: I've thought about getting one, though. As she says this, TRENT leans in and tries to kiss BETH. head dodges. After appropriate awkwardness...
85) 17) dialog: (curious, not mean) Have you sent secret coded radio messages to a lot of women? TRENT doesn't respond right away.
85) 18) dialog: You see what I mean? (CONTINUED )
85) 22) dialog: Yeah, well, thanks again.
85) 24) dialog: Me too.

Shaki her head in disgust, she pulls it out and gets a spoon. B then sits down on the couch and uses the remote control t turn on Saturday Night Live. She watches a few seconds of some lame skit, but she quickly begins eyeing the CD rack next to the TV. BETH pulls her fortune out of her purse and begins riflin through the CDs.
