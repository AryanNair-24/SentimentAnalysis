27) 11) dialog: The offer part's fine. It's this next line. "We would also accept you into our advanced management training program." Then they say something about where they'd transfer me and how much money I'd make when I got out. The Empire sounds right.

55) 16) dialog: By myself?
60) 0) text: DEAN and CAROLYN continue ignoring their food. (CONTINUED )
60) 4) dialog: Maybe..at the beginning. But then some weekend we plan on seeing each other, you'll have some major deadline, so we'll skip that and tell each other, you know, it's okay--it's just one weekend. After a while all that time in airports and on planes will get tiring, and besides there's that "hot little number" in acquisitions that's always dropping hints.
60) 6) dialog: (chuckling) No. Strike that. You're a better man than that, Dean. It'll be some smart, attractive woman who recognizes the same things in you that I do.
60) 8) dialog: I'm being realistic. Look every teenaged girl at some point in her life, falls for a boy on the other side of the lake, and no matter what promises are made: I'll write, I'll see you next summer, I'll wait for you.

63) 12) dialog: I'm beginning to see the disadvantages of having your boyfriend doing the books.
63) 15) dialog: (flustered) No. It was fine. Can we get it in a bag. LU glances distatefully at the picked at remains. LU exits.
63) 17) dialog: My views on love?
63) 19) dialog: Dean, this is difficult. I'm not sure you should be asking me this.
63) 23) dialog: Would've been a short first date.

63) 32) dialog: You see, you want to make this an easy comparison--you or the store, but it's not that simple. It's not about the store. It's about me. The store is independence. It's self worth. Look, I married Tom straight out of high school. I went straight from being somebody's daughter to somebody's girlfriend to somebody's wife to somebody's widow. Opening that store was the first thing I did completely on my own.
63) 36) dialog: Well, Dean. You could roll.

76) 1) dialog: There was this guy who asked me out every day for two weeks. He was probably close to seventy, and he kept renting the raciest things we had in the store, anything with the word erotic on the cover. He would rent the maximum six tapes at a time then return them the next day and rent six more. I'd ask him if he enjoyed the movies, and he'd say, "Not as much as I would if you'd watch them with me." Then he'd laugh this little evil laugh. Turns out, he was dubbing portions of "The Greatest Story Ever Told" over every steamy scene. I had to take him to small claims court. But I remember, very clearly, missing the daily proposition.

77) 12) dialog: No, though that was impressive, but what I'm talking about is that you didn't whine about me wanting to go dutch.
77) 16) dialog: Well you'd be surprised. You know I didn't date much, hardly at all, before you, but every time I tried to pay, it was like I was asking my date to get a vasectomy. Like somehow I was neutering him by not letting him pay. It showed you were confident. There's nothing more attractive than confidence.
