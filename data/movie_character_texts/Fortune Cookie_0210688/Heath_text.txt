2) 5) dialog: So? I don't have a problem with that. She can lead.
2) 7) dialog: This isn't too hard.
2) 9) dialog: You may not realize this, but we kids today--what with the decline in family values and all--dance a bit closer than this.

2) 15) dialog: And type four dancing represents?

2) 33) dialog: Is this where the sweet nothings come in?

2) 41) dialog: Okay, this is starting to creep me out. I think I've got it. They separate and plop down in chairs.

2) 45) dialog: Our long national nightmare is over. Who is he?
2) 47) dialog: If you insist on labeling us--we're "alternative." Oh wait a minute. I don't believe it. My sister has a date with Trent "The Dead" Kennedy.

30) 4) dialog: Pretty tough. A moment of awkward silence.
30) 6) dialog: Well, after graduation, I think I want to go to a four-year school, you know, study art, maybe go into animation.
30) 10) dialog: Sorry. You mean tonight. Dinner before the dance at Louie's On The Lake. A bunch of friends of mine are eating there. Then I was going to take her to this coffee shop down by the university. They've got one of my pieces on display there. I don't know. You think that would look like showing off?

34) 20) dialog: The food in the cafeteria--that's really bad too.
34) 22) dialog: Well, I don't recommend it. More uncomfortable silence.

42) 4) dialog: Yeah. The two glance about a bit with this thought in mind.
42) 6) dialog: Yeah. HEATH glances around again, this time because he thinks DOUG'S being a little loud. DOUG begins realizing she can push HEATH around.

50) 8) dialog: Like what?
50) 12) dialog: Don't worry.
50) 15) dialog: Sort of ironic, isn't it?

52) 9) dialog: This is a really bad anecdote. Makes me look stupid.
52) 11) dialog: I'll tell you, but you won't believe it.
52) 13) dialog: It's because of my pen pal. DOUG stares at HEATH uncomprehendingly.
52) 14) dialog: In eighth grade, Mrs. Russell signed us all up for pen pals in honors English. Remember?
52) 16) dialog: Yeah. (CONTINUED )
52) 20) dialog: Mine was from Somalia. His name is Achmad Housbhenni, and we still write every once in a while.
52) 22) dialog: It's not quite that simple. He's not even a vegetarian. He just wrote to me a lot about being hungry. All of his letters were about meals he had or questions about what I eat. After a while, I started thinking about what I was eating every time I put food into my mouth, imagining how Achmed would be enjoying this burrito more than me, or the poetry he would write if he ever got his hands on one Big Mac. I started reading about the famine, what caused it, the relief efforts, all that, and one of the things they kept mentioning, one of the reasons the U.S. couldn't export more grain, is because we use it to feed livestock.
52) 24) dialog: Yes and no. See, it takes like three times as much energy and land to produce the same amount of food as meat as it does food as grain, but in first world countries, that doesn't seem to bother anyone. We can afford it. In third world countries, it's a different story.

57) 4) dialog: True. Do you remember when we had that square dancing unit in P.E. in junior high. (CONTINUED )
57) 8) dialog: Anyway, remember how they would number all the girls, then number all the boys and you were supposed to find the person with the number that matched and that was your partner.
57) 10) dialog: Well, if one of us happened to luck out and draw someone recognizably female and then refused to trade, the football players would threaten to dismember us. So, even under this outwardly egalitarian system, the bold and the beautiful still always ended up together. There's only one time I can remember that it didn't play out like that. You ended up with this dork who had grown six inches in fourteen months. He could hardly stand upright let alone swing to the left. Anyway, some walking Coke machine tapped this lucky fellow on the shoulder and gave him a quick lesson on social Darwinism. So this guy's already walking back down to dance with Paleolithic woman, but you grabbed his hand, and told the football player to get a life.
57) 12) dialog: Yeah, well, I've wanted to ask you out ever since then.
57) 14) dialog: (indignant) No. No, that wasn't me. No ..it was my best friend, Ryan.

62) 6) dialog: Well, there are travel writers, museum guides.
62) 8) dialog: You're saying those would be a good jobs for an exuder.
62) 10) dialog: Hmmm. You're right, you don't have much ambition.
62) 12) dialog: I don't think they do that any more. Robots and all.

62) 20) dialog: No, no. I think it sounds great. I hope you're able to do it. Lu approaches the table, but a customer scoots out his ch causing the fortune cookies he's carrying for HEATH and D to pop into the air. He catches them without dropping the but it's obvious he no longer knows which cookie goes to which diner.
62) 21) dialog: Thank you.
62) 23) dialog: (facetiously) Oh, yeah, me? I'm going to make millions. Swimming pools, movie stars...

68) 3) dialog: My parents never look happy. I think that's just part of being old.
68) 8) dialog: It's not that. I just got this mental picture of my mom kissing some strange man. HEATH shudders.
68) 10) dialog: I think that's what makes you different.
68) 12) dialog: From the stereotype.
68) 14) dialog: From the "Girls who could get by on their looks" stereotype.
68) 16) dialog: Yeah. I'm sorry. That does sound bad. All I mean is that it must be a challenge. Everybody wants to make you happy, somehow or in some way. I think it would be hard to keep from thinking the world revolved around you.
68) 18) dialog: No. More than that. That you're excited for your Mom. That you don't care if she embarrasses you in front of your boyfriend. That you actually try hard in Trig. I don't know, partly it's because you said you'd come to this with me. (CONTINUED )

68) 24) dialog: I don't get it. Are you serious?
68) 26) dialog: You don't feel like it.
68) 28) dialog: To answer your question, no, I haven't been to one. Four years of high school. Zero formal dances. You're the first person--well, no, your mom is the first person--you're the second person ever to see me in a tuxedo. These things may be stupid, but I'd like the chance to find out for myself.
68) 30) dialog: I don't know exactly what your problem is. I don't know if you're embarrassed to be seen with me. Maybe you're afraid you'll see Troy with someone else. Maybe you really do hate dances. But I wish you would have just said no when I asked you.
68) 34) dialog: I'm gonna go in. I'm gonna talk to my friends. Get my picture taken. See if anyone'll dance with me. You can either wait here, or, if you want, I'll give you a ride home. Whatever you want.

Everybody knows it ain't gonna happen. It makes you want to scream at him. Charlie hang it up. She doesn't know you're alive. But what can you really tell a guy who falls for the football trick every time? I just don't want to be like that.

82) 5) dialog: You know my friend Ryan? The first day he went to work at Dunkin' Donuts, they told him he could eat all the donuts he wanted for free, so, of course, Ryan just pigged out, ate like twenty on his first day.
82) 7) dialog: Yeah, well, they know what they're doing. Ryan ended up getting so sick that he says he'll never eat another donut again. That's their little plan.
82) 9) dialog: So is that how you are with movies? Sick of them?

82) 17) dialog: Oh.
82) 19) dialog: Wow. I always knew you were smart, but there's smart, then there's salutatorian smart. I wouldn't have guessed you were up there. I mean... Don't take that wrong.
82) 21) dialog: That sounds like ambition to me.

89) 38) dialog: because then I'd have to tell you what happened when you weren't watching.
89) 40) dialog: I'm glad I did too. I don't think I'd rent the tux if I had it to do all over again, or take dance lessons.
89) 42) dialog: I figured it was necessary--unless you planned on square dancing. Don't worry. I didn't go out and pay for them. I just had my sister show me. DOUG uses the remote control to turn the TV off. She walk over to a jambox, inserts a cassette and hits play. Some romantic slow song comes on.
89) 44) dialog: Where's the mirror ball. I don't boogie without a mirror ball. Doug beckons him with her finger.
89) 45) dialog: All right. Try to keep up. DOUG places her hands on HEATH'S shoulders. HEATH nervous positions his hands on DOUG'S waist. They begin a type fo dance. After a moment, DOUG scoots in a little closer.
89) 46) dialog: Cool. Type three dancing.
89) 48) dialog: Better than type four. (CONTINUED )
89) 52) dialog: Type four--how we dance with lepers.

89) 60) dialog: And a sap.
89) 62) dialog: I couldn't tell you. I still haven't figured out mine. I doubt I'm gonna win a Grammy .
89) 67) dialog: (nervously) Yeah. They continue to dance this way for a while.
89) 69) dialog: I don't know. I think there's a law against siblings attempting it. DOUG burrows in closer--cheek to cheek or lips to ears no As they spin and we see DOUG'S face, he wears a sublime smile.
