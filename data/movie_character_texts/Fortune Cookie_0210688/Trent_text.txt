There are no Ferrari Poster or dishes piled in sink, etc. entire wall is lined with full bookshelves, but miscellan books are strewn about as well. TRENT pushes play on his answering machine. He enters his kitchen and approaches a crib. We can't see who/what he's talking to.

Then, thinking a bit about it, he pulls "The Color Purple" and collected poems of Yeats from the shelves. He inserts a bookmark in one and leaves it conspicuously out on the co table. The other he places spread eagle in another unavoidable location.

28) 1) dialog: There was this time--I think I was 16-- that I got asked to one of those Sadie Hawkins dances by this girl I didn't really know, but I said yes because, you know, I didn't want to be a dick. Technically, the girl is supposed to pick you up, but she didn't have a car and she lived like a thousand miles outside of town, so I drove out to get her. The first thing I do when I get there is lock my keys in the car. As if that's not enough, the motor's running, her parents have left for the evening, and my Dad's not home, so we're just stuck there. At first it's unbelievably awkward, but every time we look at the car we just (MORE ) (CONTINUED )

29) 1) dialog: Hi. You ready?
29) 3) dialog: No, I mean yeah, you look ready. It was rhetorical..sort of. I guess I meant are you available to leave?
29) 6) dialog: (holding out rose) This is for you.
29) 10) dialog: I got it from one of those sidewalk vendors. They say selling flowers keeps them off crack.
33) 0) text: TRENT and BETH drive to the restaurant.
33) 1) dialog: It's called The Empire. Have you heard of it?
33) 3) dialog: I've just been a couple times. Food's great. Service is unbelievable. And they have this thing.
33) 5) dialog: This thing they do. They handwrite your fortunes in the fortune cookies. Last time I went the ink was still wet.
33) 7) dialog: Clearly. It said, "Risk your heart without fear. Loneness gone. Romance near."
33) 9) dialog: Real near. The guy one table over from me was performing a non-surgical tonsillectomy on his date.
33) 11) dialog: Yeah.
33) 13) dialog: That's what made me remember it. (CONTINUED )
33) 17) dialog: It's like people think that if you're alone, you're automatically unhappy.
33) 19) dialog: Same here.
38) 0) text: TRENT is talking to BETH over wine.
38) 1) dialog: We'll be live on air, and I'll take calls off the request line,and I just know these guys are already stoned. I do the morning show. So it's like seven a.m., and I've got Jeff Spicoli calling into ask me about radio. Not how to break into the business, but how to fix them. "Yo, Dead, there's too much distortion." And I can hear it cranked in the background, but you can't tell these guys to just turn it down. TRENT looks for encouragement from BETH, but she seems uninterested. (CONTINUED )
38) 4) dialog: So anyway ..well, Fortune Cookie - 34. 39 it's boring. Shop talk. BETH realizes she's been snagged.
38) 6) dialog: (unenthused) I'll play Nirvana "unplugged". They think I've fixed their radio. BETH manages a laugh.
38) 7) dialog: Yeah, so...
38) 9) dialog: No it's not. It' love the music, car alarm store people who show to my show--and who braid their eyebrows, tatoo

38) 14) dialog: So he will soon.
38) 16) dialog: screeching halt. Have you ever played the strained- metaphor game? (CONTINUED )
38) 20) dialog: The strained metaphor game. The correct answer is no, because I just made it up.
38) 22) dialog: We're irrigating the conversation. Replenishing it.
38) 24) dialog: I'm not sure. I just liked the title.
38) 27) dialog: All right. I've got it. The first person names two random items or concepts. The second person has to complete the strained metaphor.
38) 29) dialog: No, the challenging version is the precise metaphor game. It's in your best interest not to confuse the two.
38) 31) dialog: Sure. Let me think. O.K. First dates are like... TRENT scans the restaurant
38) 32) dialog: wa glass of water. (CONTINUED )
38) 36) dialog: I was thinking more along the lines of quenching a thirst, but I think you understand the game. So, onto round one. How about a heart and an edible garnish.
38) 39) dialog: Bonus points for extra strained. But I think I can see a theme here.
38) 42) dialog: That's easy. Love is an empire that conquers all.
38) 44) dialog: God, I feel like I'm on a date with the walking wounded.
38) 48) dialog: Healthy diet, lots of excercise.
38) 50) dialog: I've been in love. Well, it felt like.. I thought it was.. There was this girl who.. Jesus, I lived with a woman for three years!
38) 52) dialog: I've been deeply, head over heels, madly in like. Lots of times.
38) 54) dialog: Do you think this somehow gives you more soul.

45) 8) dialog: Player? Like Warren Beatty is a player?
45) 10) dialog: I think it's my job.
45) 12) dialog: Sort of. Never being at a loss for words. It's kind of like dating.
45) 14) dialog: Not really. You?
45) 16) dialog: So, if you're the broken heart expert, tell me what it's like--this love thang.
45) 18) dialog: Yikes.
45) 22) dialog: Are we still in the good part?
45) 24) dialog: I've heard something about swooning.
50) 0) text: TRENT walks into the bathroom and finds HEATH sitting on floor. TRENT, self-consciously, goes about his business.
50) 1) dialog: Date going well?
50) 3) dialog: Niceness is overrated. Something they say they want, but in the end...
50) 5) dialog: (thinking better of expounding on this theory) Look, do you have any anecdotes?
50) 7) dialog: Anecdotes. Little stories to fall back on.
50) 9) dialog: I don't know. They have to be your stories, but don't tell her about leading the county in rushing yardage or about (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
50) 13) dialog: The best anecdotes..hmm. At first they sound self-depreciating, but used properly, they reveal your sensitive side. They show how vulnerable you are. If that doesn't work, make fun of the fattest kid in your school. HEATH looks at TRENT with something approaching shock.
50) 14) dialog: That's a joke. I tell you, though, it's like an Olympic event. You get better the more you practice.
50) 16) dialog: (laughs) Ironic? You are your sister's brother.
53) 0) text: TRENT and BETH are finishing up their meals.
53) 1) dialog: So it's your turn to pick the novel for the book club next time. Do you know what you're going to pick?
53) 3) dialog: No, I've read The Accidental Tourist, though.
53) 5) dialog: That's not me. That's the ninety one point seven guy. I'm the one who does "Strange Body Sounds."
53) 7) dialog: That I can read?
53) 9) dialog: Yeah, well, it's the result of a ..uh, complicated childhood. TRENT waits a beat for BETH to bite; she doesn't. He proc in his "anecdote" mode.
53) 10) dialog: When I was a kid, I was afraid of bees. (CONTINUED )
53) 14) dialog: Yeah, bees. I fell into a hive once. Got stung like eight times. After that, you couldn't get me to go outside.
53) 16) dialog: I'm talking for a couple years. Anyway, after school each day, I had to go over to my Meemaw's house.
53) 18) dialog: What do you say?
53) 20) dialog: (laughs) So, Meemaw lived near this pond and all these dragonflies would be buzzing around her yard, but I didn't know what dragonflies were. I thought they were giant bees. LU approaches the table.
53) 22) dialog: Sure. I was afraid to go outside, and Meemaw didn't have a TV, or it was always broken, I can't remember. But she did have Dad's complete Hardy Boys collection. That's when I started reading. I think I read them all two or three times.
53) 26) dialog: That, and my endless quest for truth. Hey, could you believe Randall chose The Hobbit for the group last month. Did he think we were all in sixth grade? Did you see the "I Break For Unicorns" bumper sticker on his car?
56) 0) text: The check and the fortune cookies have arrived on TRENT a BETH'S table.
56) 1) dialog: What does yours say?
56) 3) dialog: Those are wishes. Fortunes you're actually supposed to tell. TRENT breaks open his cookie and reads his fortune.
56) 5) dialog: (reading) "He who is lonely is he who is always..."
56) 7) dialog: That's it. I think the ending got torn off. Makes sense if you add "in bed."
56) 9) dialog: It doesn't make sense that way.
56) 13) dialog: (reading) He who is lonely is he who is always after sex. Oh, yeah. (He lets' that sink in.) So what about yours? What does yours say?
56) 15) dialog: Let me hear it.
56) 17) dialog: Sounds like something from the Bible: Book of Abba, chapter thirteen, verse four.
56) 19) dialog: You know, this is why not everyone is given a radio show.
61) 0) text: TRENT and BETH ride in TRENT'S car.
61) 2) dialog: C'mon, be a sport.
61) 4) dialog: That's my girl. This one's called "Surreal Date." Here's how it works. You get two choices. You pick of them. By the time we're finished, I'll have a complete psychological profile on you.
61) 6) dialog: First, your date. Woody Allen or Sylvester Stallone.
61) 8) dialog: He is, but he's feeling surly, reclusive. It's the Woodman or Rocky tonight.
61) 12) dialog: Hardly. Honestly, I have a tough time remembering which is which.
61) 14) dialog: Both of them are Oscar winning screenwriters. They've dated some of the hottest babes in show business?
61) 16) dialog: Frank Sinatra thought so. Okay, what else? Woody Allen visited Dallas to promote Everything You Wanted To Know About Sex. Sly had sex after auditioning for Dallas.
61) 18) dialog: Charlie Sheen. Rod Stewart.
61) 22) dialog: Surprising. Now, attending a Planet Hollywood opening or playing in the MTV Rock And Jock softball game?
61) 26) dialog: (shaking head) Eh, eh, eh, eh. No getting out of this.
61) 28) dialog: My house. Now. Sly's ignoring you..
61) 30) dialog: I just need to run in and give Rover some medicine.
61) 32) dialog: I'll drop you off if you want, but I swear there's no devious motive. You could wait in the car if you wanted.
64) 0) text: We return to TRENT'S interview scene.
64) 1) dialog: Most of the women I date? Let's see, if there's one recurring trait, I would have to say that they're all fun. All fun girls. Definitely out to have a good time.
65) 0) text: TRENT and BETH arrive at Trent's house. They round a shru or wall, or similar barrier and run into a tipsy TERESA w is fishing her earrings out of the mailbox.
65) 1) dialog: Teresa ..this is a surprise.
65) 7) dialog: (to Beth) Let me just make sure she makes it out to the cab.
65) 12) dialog: Don't worry about it.
67) 0) text: TRENT enters his house.
67) 1) dialog: So, Stallone's rented a couple movies for the limo ride. He gives you the choice of either Rocky Three or...
67) 5) dialog: «Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot. Whatever you say.
67) 7) dialog: She's a friend. We hang out sometimes.
67) 10) dialog: You don't?
67) 12) dialog: Well, we can't all aspire to Ann Tyler status.
67) 14) dialog: She's boring.
67) 16) dialog: Sic her boy. Attack! The sight of the sick kitten melts BETH a bit. (CONTINUED )
67) 20) dialog: Not Rover--Ro VAIR. He's named for the French poet.
67) 22) dialog: Man, you don't let anything slide. Can you help me here.
67) 24) dialog: Just wrap up his legs here in the blanket.
67) 26) dialog: Yeah, that's good. The maneuvering and repositioning TRENT and BETH undertak order to medicate the cat forces them into close physical proximity to each other.
67) 27) dialog: This is not the most pleasant part of his day. He's like one of those Aliens trying to claw out of someone's chest. Okay, Ro-- it's time for your Shirley Temple. TRENT withdraws a small bottle of pinkish medicine and a dropper that he tries to force into Rover's mouth.
67) 28) dialog: (singing) "On the good ship, Lollypop. It's a something, something, to the candy shop."
67) 32) dialog: I'm not sure. I just found him out in the alley going through my garbage. I don't think he comes from a very good family. TRENT successfully gets ROVER to swallow his drops. He si down on a couch and pets the kitten while Beth wanders ba to the bookcases.
67) 34) dialog: (slightly embarrassed) Not every one.
67) 36) dialog: The Cat In The Hat Comes Back. I don't go for sequels.
73) 0) text: BETH continues to rummage through TRENT'S book shelves. R wanders about. BETH pulls a book off a shelf. (CONTINUED )
73) 4) dialog: Open it up.
73) 6) dialog: It was a gag gift.
73) 8) dialog: Mom.
73) 11) dialog: I think half my paycheck goes straight to Book 'Em Dano's.
73) 13) dialog: No string quartets playing on the staircase. No croissant peddling cappuccino bar. No events for single lit lovers. Just floor-to-ceiling books. God bless ‘em. BETH pulls a book off the shelf.
73) 17) dialog: Really? Mine too. Well, actually, I've got like seven favorite books of all time. Check out the flap.
73) 19) dialog: They were interviewing him on our AM affiliate, so I put on Freebird--this was when we were still classic rock and I was Trent "The Grateful Dead" Kennedy. BETH doesn't respond.
73) 20) dialog: That was a joke. Anyway, I ran across the hall with a tape recorder and got him to sign my book and do a promo.
73) 22) dialog: Yeah, I play it every once in a while for a laugh. It's him saying, "I'm John Irving, and whenever I'm in town, I rock harder on one oh one point seven." Afterwards, I get all these calls wanting to know if John Irving plays bass for Primus.
73) 24) dialog: That's what my station manager was saying the other day.
73) 26) dialog: It's the voice. In high school, I went through career placement, and they said I could do this or sing bass for the Oak Ridge Boys. (CONTINUED )
73) 30) dialog: Do you need to use a phone?
73) 32) dialog: There's one right there ..or you could use the one in the bedroom.
73) 34) dialog: (smiling knowingly) Straight back.
74) 0) text: BETH sits on the edge of TRENT'S bed to use the phone. Sh does actually glance at the ceiling to make sure there is mirror on it. The candles above the bed visibly concern h She dials.
81) 0) text: BETH and TRENT eat ice cream cones as they sit on a bench at a sidewalk table outside of an ice cream shop.
81) 1) dialog: I don't know what the Chinese did before ice cream. If I eat anything spicy, I've gotta have ice cream.
81) 3) dialog: Now that sounds like a fortune cookie.
81) 5) dialog: I read this thing the other day. It was too long to be a fortune cookie. I think it was a quote from someone semi-famous. It said that a relationship was impossible between two people if their favorite movies couldn't stand to be in the same room together at a party.
81) 7) dialog: Yeah. If movies were personified, would they hit it off? Like, I doubt The Bicycle Thief and Porky's Revenge would be hanging out by the punchbowl together. So what's yours? (CONTINUED )
81) 11) dialog: Yeah.
81) 13) dialog: Something by Bergman. BETH shakes her head.
81) 14) dialog: Fellini?
81) 16) dialog: Thelma and Louise. BETH doesn't respond. She looks disgruntled. TRENT laughs
81) 17) dialog: (CONT'D)
81) 20) dialog: No, but that's a party I wouldn't want to miss.
81) 22) dialog: Not important. How is that vanilla? I can't believe you ordered vanilla.
81) 24) dialog: I'm not saying. I'm hoping this way you'll describe me as mysterious to your roommate. (CONTINUED )
81) 28) dialog: I think it may be the only safe territory. You haven't been exactly forthcoming, and every time I've gutted it up and started to tell a story, a real story, you either look like you're going to nod off or you make fun of me.
81) 30) dialog: You don't.
81) 32) dialog: But isn't that what dating's about. You tell each other your stories. If you like each other's stories, you keep going out.
81) 34) dialog: You live together.
84) 0) text: BETH and TRENT sit in TRENT'S parked car.
84) 2) dialog: The really demented part is that this is what DJs strive for--the morning shift. Prime time in radio land. It's not like, if I get better, they'll give me a shift where I can sleep in. The car is consumed in silence.
85) 0) text: BETH pulls at her door handle and starts to get out of th car. TRENT quickly follows suit. The two converse while moving towards the door.
85) 1) dialog: I'll walk you up.
85) 3) dialog: If I don't I won't get my merit badge. (CONTINUED )
85) 6) dialog: Do you have a clock alarm?
85) 8) dialog: Set it for seven.
85) 10) dialog: I'll say something to you in code on the air. Everyone will hear it, but you'll be the only one who'll understand.
85) 12) dialog: Sure it will.
85) 14) dialog: You don't have a radio? BETH shakes her head.
85) 16) dialog: Sorry.
85) 21) dialog: Women, men, friends, relatives. I guess I ought to be going.
85) 23) dialog: I had fun.
85) 25) dialog: I'll give you a call. BETH gives a "Yeah, right" nod and opens her door.
85) 27) dialog: Good night. BETH closes the door. TRENT trudges away. He points an imaginary gun at his head and pulls the trigger.
87) 0) text: TRENT drives home from BETH'S apartment. He's cranks the "Fortune Cookie" that's playing on the radio.
91) 0) text: TRENT gets some change out of his pocket. From the inside coat pocket of his jacket he pulls out an address book. H flips through the pages locating the correct number. He dials. (CONTINUED )
91) 3) dialog: Still be up. Still be up.
92) 2) dialog: Uh, hi, Beth. This is Trent.
92) 4) dialog: Listen, I wanted to call and tell you that I ..I don't know.. that I think you're swell.
