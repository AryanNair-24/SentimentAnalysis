113) 3) dialog: Let me see some ID.  Something with a picture.  I don't give a shit about your badge. Talley takes out his wallet and flashes his photo ID.  Jo does the same in return --
113) 4) dialog: Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
113) 6) dialog: Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it. Jones slaps the side of the van.  Doors open, and the remaining five men climb out.  They strap into vests with emblazoned on the back, then pass out load-bearing gear, masks, and flash-bang grenades.
113) 7) dialog: In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
113) 9) dialog: Don't worry about what we used to be.
113) 11) dialog: What's my name?
113) 13) dialog: I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
113) 15) dialog: Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs. The men at the second van are now passing out MP5s, CAR-1 and loaded magazines --
113) 17) dialog: You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
113) 19) dialog: Let's go, Chief.  Time to get real. Jones walks away, and all Talley can do is follow --
116) 1) dialog: Walter Smith is in the Federal Witness Protection program.  When Washington learned about the situation here, they asked Chief Talley for his cooperation.
116) 3) dialog: I'm sure you will be, Captain, but it's after midnight.  Now, if you'll pull your people off the perimeter, I want to get my people in position. Martin looks like she wants to spit bullets --
132) 2) dialog: Not until the man calls.
132) 4) dialog: They've been in there all day. Talley's phone rings.  Again, they both think that it's t white phone, but instead it's Talley's personal phone --
132) 8) dialog: Talley!  We'll secure the house, but then we get the disks. Talley accepts that; they move toward the house --
136) 1) dialog: Go -- They blast the flames with their fire extinguishers, then plunge into the hall --
139) 2) dialog: Where's the office?
139) 4) dialog: We don't need you any more, Chief.  We can get the disks on our own. But before Jones can kill Talley, Mars heaves himself up the flames, firing wildly.  He hits Jones in the head -- Talley fires reflexively, his powerful .45 kicking Mars across the room and out the glass doors.  Talley turns ba to the burning door and douses the flames with his fire extinguisher --
