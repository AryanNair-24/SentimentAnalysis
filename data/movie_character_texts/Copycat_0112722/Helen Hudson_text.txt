Behind her a projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA FANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and TRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser pointing device.  We see her from a considerable distance... the back of the balcony.  Her voice is crisp assured.
0) 1) dialog: Our society creates these socially and psychically disenfranchised men, and their revenge on society is terrible.  They are hard to catch.  They are "the nice guy next door," their employers -- if they work at all -- find them quiet and uncomplaining.  Early abuse and rejection have taught them passivity.  Only in their violent fantasies do they feel alive.  What they seek in their frenzied assaults on their victims is relief from passivity.  For these men, ten minutes relief is worth far more than the life of another human being.  Torture, the pain they inflict, the screams of the victim, are all part of the ritual that gives them a brief respite from their own psychic pain.  And then the depression, the forgetting, the feeling of sadness and despair begins the cycle all over again. Like addicts seeking their drug, Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono, Berkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they seek out their next victim. During the second half of this speech, the eye of the cam has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the balcony railing.
0) 3) dialog: The cycle is endless until they are caught.  And they are caught by chance -- they run a red light, and a body is in the trunk.  A leaking         pipe brings a plumber to a basement where they is the smell of death. Her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye the balcony... Her voice chokes off.  She stares.
0) 4) text: Sitting in the front row of the balcony, a YOUNG RED-HEAD MAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward, resting his tattoo arms on the railing.  He smiles intimately at HELEN. HELEN cuts her eyes to the left.  She sees: Backstage, an overweight COP in plain clothes.  Instantly alert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch exposing his presence to the audience.  A SECOND COP, in wings on the other side of the stage, also springs to attention.  FIRST COP'S eyes follow HELEN'S... Their POV:  THE BALCONY - YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN is no long there. HELEN  Can she believe her eyes?  Resumes:
0) 5) dialog: At any time, right now, as you listen, the FBI estimates there are 30 to 35 serial killers stalking their victims.  The serial killer is a plaque that must be addressed not only by the law, but by science. Florida spent eight million dollars to execute Ted Bundy.  It would have been better spent building a forensic penal facility devoted to research. Once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure hersel that the smiling man is not there...
0) 6) dialog: Confined for life, without parole, and subjected to scientific study, these men's lives might finally, in some small measure, educate and thereby protect society.  Thank you. Applause as Helen warily checks for the TWO COPS.  They a carefully casing the crowd.

H hastily ducks back into HALL and signals an okay to Helen Before the door behind her closes, we see the COP prepare stand guard outside.  HELEN walks past the stall with the high heels to a stall several doors down.
1) 1) text: And a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the ankles.  The shoes are kicked off.  The feet disappear fr view as HELEN, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet pape around the seat before raising her skirt.  A faint noise makes her freeze.  Her hand reaches for the door.  She is just able to unlock it, but no more, before a NOISE COMES DOWN FROM THE NEXT STALL. Like a lariat it falls over HELEN'S head and is violently yanked tight.  She kicks at the stall door. CORRIDOR: COP, leaning against outside door smoking, hear the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. He reacts...
2) 1) text: Doctor Hudson?  Are you okay in there? The MAN lets slip a little slack. HELEN'S fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck, get just enough air for HELEN to let out a strangled litt scream. CORRIDOR: COP, not certain what to do about the ambiguous sounds from inside.  Women stands nearby, inhibiting him a split second from going in the Ladies' Room door.  Now there is more SOUND from inside...
3) 0) text: COP steps into the room, gun down.  Over the COP'S should we see HELEN hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering a her throat.  She has one slippery shoeless foot on the toilet seat. COP takes a couple of steps forward.  Behind COP'S back w see a broom closet door opening. HELEN'S POV: CLOSE UP: The COP, taken from behind.  In a second, his throat is slit.  In a gush of  blood, he fall his gun still in his hand. RED-HEADED MAN standing over the fallen COP, smiling at HELEN. COP'S BODY IS TWITCHING, JERKING.  The violent contractio in his fingers cause the gun to go off... ONE... TWO SHOT the sound reverberating against the tile walls.

But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened?  Did he just stop?  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself?  Did he die in an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die?  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back? M.J. stands.
