13) 7) dialog: It's Biaggio.
13) 9) dialog: He’s been in our class since the 4th grade. (beat) We’ll get to him later man - are you in? Patrick rubs his eyes. Joe isn’t kidding.
13) 11) dialog: Of course I’m serious. Look, you can’t live with your parents, I certainly can’t live with Shit-Ass Frank any more. If we do this we can make our own rules, make our own choices! Live and die by our wits, like men! What do we need? A few 2x10s and a foundation?

17) 6) dialog: Fine. I'11 do some research, okay? We both will. Patrick hands Joe a box of frozen waffles.
17) 8) dialog: (sigh) Yes, fine, you know things. But no one learns as much from books as they do from actual real life, okay?

22) 5) dialog: (walks to his side) Sometimes when I’m about to make a big decision, I say “I will go through with this unless God gives me a very definite omen within the next 30 seconds.” We could do that.
22) 7) dialog: Okay, time. Let’s go.
22) 9) dialog: Yes, that’s thunder. (points at shit) That’s a tree, that’s a rock. It’s nature. It’s not an omen. He walks into the woods.

29) 5) dialog: (cups hands to mouth) Biaggio, just let go when you get to the top! It’s not even deep!
29) 7) dialog: I know. He once told me he’s only afraid of two things -- drowning, werewolves, very old music, and homeless women who can run or jump.
29) 9) dialog: I’m telling you exactly what he told me. Biaggio swings, all four limbs wrapped around the tire. At the top of his swing, he does nothing, paralzed with fear He swings back and forth, losing momentum.
29) 11) dialog: We're here Biaggio! We won't let the river claim you! Biaggio drops his legs. They enter the water at the knee. His hands are still fused to the tire. He hangs there.
29) 12) dialog: Okay...we’re sort of in no man’s land here, Biaggio! Just make a decision! We want to use the tire!
29) 14) dialog: Did you hear that, Biaggio? I’m giving you one more chance to do this on your terms! Biaggio lets go and falls awkwardly into the stream.

34) 9) dialog: Sure it is. You don’t think I know that? It falls off the goddam bone. But Boston Market, that’s not roughing it, that’s not living by our wits. That’s not the man’s code, the code of the forest.
34) 11) dialog: Yes, sure, one day. C’mon man, this was a test, and we passed. JOE'S POV: a B.M. employee throws garbage in a side dumps Close on Joe as he gets an idea.

35) 4) dialog: I hope to God there are. A bear would feed us for a month... Joe looks at the wheelbarrow.
35) 5) dialog: He'd be too big for the trap...but I think we could at least disillusion him. A bear who doesn’t believe in anything is easier to bring down.

39) 2) dialog: Why should that be surprising? Chicken outnumber people in this world. You’re an educated guy, I don’t need to tell you that.
39) 4) dialog: Well that’s crazy. There was a time when you hadn’t seen me yet, right? Did that mean I didn’t exist?
39) 6) dialog: It doesn’t matter. Biaggio, your creamed spinach is to die for. Biaggio nods.
39) 8) dialog: C’mon man. We’re having a nice meal.

40) 7) dialog: Ah...Do you feel it?
40) 9) dialog: We’re doing it, man. We have shelter, water, the means to put food on the table. We’re totally self-reliant. We just grew up. (then) We're men now. Men.
40) 11) dialog: It happened man. Cheers. Joe takes another pull. Patrick shakes his head, bemused.
40) 12) dialog: Now all we need is the Ham.
40) 14) dialog: The Ham. You know, the Ham -- the pussy.
40) 16) dialog: It’s in the culture.
40) 18) dialog: The Ham! We takin’ a ride in the HAMbulance, to HAMsterdam! Uh!
40) 20) dialog: I am. (swig) I’m just saying, if something were missing from this, that would be it. (then) A woman’s touch. He drinks, suddenly distant. We know who he’s thinking about... He hears a sqeak, and notices a SQUIRREL peering at him. reaches into his coat and tosses it a NUT, or some tasty morsel. It grabs the nut and takes off.

49) 1) dialog: Make yourself at home, man. You thirsty? Hungry? Joe reaches for the apple bowl, tosses one to Aaron.
49) 3) dialog: About ten days. It’s a pretty simple structure. The roof is plywood, it just rests there...you could flap it open if you wanted to...I handled schematics...Patrick bound most of the walls together... Joe looks around. A moment of pride for the accomplishmen
49) 4) dialog: Anyway, it’s a start. Eventually we'll add to it. We’re just still getting used to the family dynamic. But we have ideas for the place. We've talked about a garden. (MORE )
49) 6) dialog: I know Biaggio desperately wants a dog.

52) 2) dialog: If anyone makes eye contact with me, I’m gone. If they ask you, deny everything. EXT. WOLFE’S POND PARK, BEACH - NIGHT They're at “Thirsty Thursdays,” a raging, lively keg. Mus a bonfire, a huge keg line, teenagers grinding up on each other. Fun. Joe walks along the outer edge of the general party area, keeping his head low, but taking it in. Shit, if his life had been anything like this... 61.

She’s surrounded by dudes with backwards hats. One of the guys has her around the waist. They toss her, screaming, into the bay. Laughter. She emerges, yelling and splashing at them. Tight on Joe. Suddenly, two hands land on Joe’s shoulders and whip him around. A BLONDE KID is staring him in the face.
