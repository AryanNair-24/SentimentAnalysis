15) 65) text: Coffey nods, relieved. Then he surprises everybody by offering Paul his hand, as if to show proper manners. Pau hesitates, oddly touched, then surprised his men even mor accepting. Coffey's hand swallows his. Coffey shakes gent lets go. Paul steps from the cell. Brutal slides the door shut, lo it.

84) 19) dialog: In a minute.
84) 21) text: Paul slaps him hard, knocks him sideways. Percy looks up, blinking in surprise. Paul grabs him, yanks him back up.
84) 22) dialog: You shut up and listen. You deserved to be punished for what you did to Del. You'll accept it like a man, or we'll make you sorry you were ever born. We'll tell people how you sabotaged Del's execution--
84) 24) dialog: --and how you pissed yourself like a frightened little girl. Yes, we'll talk, that's a given--but, Percy, mind me now...we'll also see you beaten within an inch of your life.
84) 26) dialog: We know people, too, are you so foolish you don't realize that? People with friends and loved ones doing time in this prison. People who'd be happy to amputate you nose or your penis just so someone they care about could get an extra three hours in the exercise yard every week. (off Percy's look) Let bygones be bygones. Nothing's hurt so far but your pride...and nobody need ever know about that except the people in this room.
84) 33) dialog: Think it over, Percy.

Paul and the other tackle Percy and bring him down, wrest the gun out of his hand. Dean is almost weeping:
84) 44) text: Percy is flat on his back, staring up at nothing. The bla "bugs" come drifting out of nose and mouth, swirling in t air over his head. They turn white and disappear. The men are speechless. Paul turns, sees Coffey sitting o the floor at his bars, watching.
84) 46) dialog: Why Wild Bill? Why?
84) 48) dialog: What? Saw what?
84) 52) text: Paul hesitates, torn between reason and Coffey's pleading eyes. A whisper:

84) 55) dialog: No...please...
84) 57) text: ...and Paul sees: The Detterick twins. Kathe and Cora. Laughing and playing hopscotch in the dust under a later afternoon sun... A dinner table.

An hand with a paint brush slopping bright red paint on t side of a barn... Kathe skipping to the head of the hopscotch squares, turn and starting back, laughing in the sun... The paint brush slopping more paint, dripping like blood. Paul jerks and twists, trying to pull away, trying to bre the circuit, but he can't, not till all is seen and done: Marjorie Detterick calling from the porch for everybody t come eat, supper's ready... A hammer pausing. Klaus looking down from atop the barn.. The Detterick twins finishing their hopscotch, gathering their jump ropes from the dust, running across the yard.. The basket of biscuits being passed to little Cora, who t a biscuit and passes it on... Klaus coming down the ladder, calling to his daughters. T little girls running past the man with the paint brush, w turns and smile as they go by...it's Wild Bill. The basket of biscuits is passed one last time. A hand pu one out, raises it for a bite. It's Wild Bill, smiling at little girls as conversation flows around the table... Paul screams, trying to pull away, but: The porch door is kicked off its hinges just before dawn, figure looming in the doorway. Kathe wakes, her scream cu short as the man's fist punches her hard in the face... Paul trembles violently as if riding the lightning himsel pleading for it to stop, but there's one last thing: Wild Bill looms over the terrified little girls like a horrendous boogeyman, whispers to Kathe:
84) 59) text: And he drags them out into the coming dawn... ...as Coffey lets Paul go. Paul is gasping, back in the r world where his men are staring at him with wide eyes.
84) 61) text: Paul nods, numb. Tears are flowing down Coffey's face. So

85) 13) dialog: No.
88) 0) text: TIGHT ON PAUL as softly:
88) 1) dialog: It makes sense. I read the file. Hal even said it himself. Wharton rambled all over the state last few years, causing trouble. Hell, longer than that. Been at it since he was ten. Vandalism. Petty theft. Setting fires.
88) 4) dialog: Their father hired him on for a few days last spring, help repair the barn. Cheap labor, just another drifter...
88) 6) dialog: Sick bastard came back a month later, just before dawn. Took the girls...did what he did. Coffey found them afterwards and tried to help. It was too late.
88) 8) dialog: Based on what, honey? Some kind of magical vision I had?
88) 11) dialog: They got their killer as far as they're concerned. Hell, Coffey's own lawyer would come throw the switch if we let him.
88) 13) dialog: Lie? About what?
88) 18) dialog: All the more reason he might take credit for the crime. He's gonna fry anyway, so why not boast?
88) 29) dialog: Because he's a six-foot-eight-inch baldheaded black man with barely enough brains to feed himself. How long you think it'd be before he was recaptured? Two hours? Six?
88) 32) text: Paul tries to take her hand. She wrenches away, furious.
88) 38) dialog: Even that time we went camping and you called me Old Stinky Sam?
88) 41) dialog: No.
88) 43) dialog: I won't.
88) 45) dialog: No. I've been thinking about it, too, believe me. (beat) Tell you the truth, honey. I've done some things in my life I'm not proud of, but this is the first time I've ever felt in real danger of hell.

89) 4) dialog: I guess you know we're coming down to it now. Another couple of days. (beat) Is there anything special you'd like for dinner that night? We can rustle you up most anything.

89) 12) text: Paul sits, working himself up to it:
89) 13) dialog: John, I have to ask you something very important right now.
89) 15) dialog: I do. I do have to. (beat) John, tell me what you want me to do. You want me to take you out of here? Just let you run away? See how far you can get?
89) 17) text: Paul hesitates, emotions swirling, trying to find the rig words.
89) 18) dialog: On the day of my judgement, when I stand before God, and He asks me why did I kill one of his true miracles, what am I gonna say? That is was my job? My job?
89) 20) text: Coffey hesitates--now he's the one trying to find the rig words, trying to make Paul understand:
89) 22) text: By now, Paul is blinking back tears. Softly:
89) 23) dialog: Yes, John. I think I can.
89) 31) text: Paul and the men are scattered about in the otherwise emp auditorium, also watching.
90) 3) text: Paul indicates St. Christopher medal around John's neck:
90) 4) dialog: John, I should have that just for now. I'll give it back after.

90) 7) dialog: Did you, John?
90) 13) dialog: What should we pray for, John?
90) 15) text: Paul nods--strength it is. Dean surprises Brutal and Harr also kneeling. Brutal and Harry hesitate...then join them
90) 16) dialog: God, please help us finish what we've started, and please welcome this man, John Coffey--like the drink, but not spelled the same-- into heaven and give him peace. Please help us to see him off the best we can and let nothing go wrong. Amen.
90) 17) text: Paul starts to rise, but Coffey takes his hand.
90) 19) dialog: You go right ahead, John. Take all the time you need.

90) 37) dialog: Roll on one.
90) 40) dialog: John Coffey...you have been condemned to die in the electric chair by a jury of your peers...sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state. Do you have anything to say before sentence is carried out?
90) 44) text: Brutal takes the mask from the hook to draw it over Coffe head. Coffey looks to Paul with terrified, pleading eyes.
90) 46) dialog: All right, John.
90) 52) dialog: is staring at Coffey, unable to say the words.
90) 54) text: Paul can't. He reaches out and touches Coffey's hand. The fingers clasp. In that moment, staring into his eyes, Pau hears the last thought that ever goes through Coffey's he
90) 56) text: Their fingers disengage. Paul steps back, eyes still lock with Coffey's, and says the hardest words he's ever spoke
90) 57) dialog: Roll on two.
90) 58) text: Van Hay throws the switch. Coffey surges forward, fingers splayed and jittering past Old Sparky's arms. Lights begin blowing out all over the Mile, raining shatt glass and sparks. Some of the witnesses scream. A thin line of blood comes trickling out of Klaus Detteri nose. He reaches up, absently wipes it away. Coffey's eyes are locked on Paul's, riding the lightning the way. He finally slumps. Van Hay kills the current. Coffey's expression is peaceful, as if sleeping. A final of tears drift gently down his cheeks.

94) 1) dialog: That was the last execution I ever took part in. Just couldn't do it anymore after that. Brutal either. We both transferred out, took jobs with Boys' Correctional. (beat, nods) That was all right. Catch 'em young, that became my motto. Might even have done some good.
94) 3) dialog: You don't believe me.
94) 5) dialog: ...It's quite a story.
94) 7) dialog: The math doesn't work, does it?
