10) 442) dialog: I'm what?
10) 444) dialog: You'd be scarred. You'd be really  scarred if I hadn't wrapped them  trap teeth in sacking. Which was her  idea.

13) 127) dialog: Pack a pan full of snow. I need good  clean water, boiled up.
13) 130) dialog: He'll die first. He's got hardly no  blood left in him.

13) 206) text: Ruby stomps out of the hut.

13) 209) dialog: In fact, if you're going to wimble  all night I'm going to sleep in with  him.
13) 241) dialog: He's right.
13) 243) text: Ruby gives a curt nod, goes over to Stobrod's hut. Inman  gets close to Ada.
