0) 8) dialog: The Bronx is all these things. But it is also home to the families that are the infra- structure of the greatest city in the world— the fireman, the cab-drivers, the sanitation workers, the secretaries, the teachers and the cops. And the guys who work in our local prisons. Like myself
0) 10) dialog: Now: City Island is distinct from the rest of the Bronx by virtue of being located on it’s own two lane spit, right in the middle of the Sound. Most people don’t believe it until they see it. And within the one square mile that comprises all there is of City Island lies another distinction. That of the muscle-sucker versus the clam digger.
0) 12) dialog: The ‘muscle-sucker’ is an island resident who moved here from somewhere else. The ‘clam- digger’, however, was born and bred on City Island, preferably in the same house that’s been handed down through the generations. Myself, I'm a clam-digger. There’s quite a few of us. Houses don’t go up for sale here everyday. My grandparents built our house in 1924. My dad grew up here. So did I. My kids did too. And this goes to the heart of why it matters so much to a clam-digger to be what he is and not some mussel-sucker.
0) 14) dialog: Because we represent family, continuity, stability. And in the Bronx—hell, in the world as we know it—these qualities are in increasingly short supply. In short, the world can be divided between clam-diggers and mussel suckers. Those who stay, and those who wander. But I digress. You asked me my worst secret. My most personal secret. The secret of all my secrets. Well..like most of us, I guess I have a few. From an upstairs side-window, we see SMOKE. Not billowing or threatening, just gently emerging from the window.

35) 40) dialog: Shh. Don’t tell no-one. He offers a cigarette to Tony, who refuses it. Pause. Vince’s eyes: Vince is interested
35) 42) dialog: Yeah, they got that rule now. Must suck.

Watch it cause Frankie Grinucci has eyes in the back of his head.” (pause—puzzled) My head. Must mean in the back of my head. The Casting Assistant’s eyes are on the ceiling.
65) 5) dialog: Uh-not really. I’m a corrections officer.
65) 7) dialog: Guess you could call it that. 68
65) 9) dialog: North Jersey State Correctional.
65) 11) dialog: I wouldn't call it that, sir, not by a longshot. We got people in there who..lemme put it this way: if you could see inside their minds and what they’re thinking..you wouldn't be thinking of no golf game.
65) 13) dialog: Typical? Well..no such animal. Some days it’s rote and tote-you know, roll call and work duty. Nothin’ much happens. Other days... (pause, then) other days there’s trouble. Gangs get outta control. We gotta lockdown. The boys and girls have their little bitch spats just like in the real world only they jump some bones and try to make their mettle on the new recruits. Ugly stuff. Sometimes guys come in and I say to myself “Two words for you: bye-bye.” Cause I know they ain’t getting out the same as they came in, if you know what I mean.
65) 15) dialog: My own words? Well, I didn’t read the whole script or nothin’, but it seems like this Joey Zambooli thinks he’s got the goods on the guy I play. Frankie— (consults script) Grinucci. Which makes this Zambooli the worst kind of creep.
65) 17) dialog: Well, like for instance, where I work? It’s all about power. And guys like Zambooli come at the new guys and try to intimidate them. And if you don’t get in their face fast, they’1ll have you on all fours sucking the cement. (pause, then) Pardon me.
65) 19) dialog: Well what I would do is make it very clear from the beginning that I am more psycho than they are.
65) 21) dialog: Well.. I’d put my hand on this Joey Zambooli’s shoulder and sorta from nowhere I’d go: “I think I’m pissed off with you but I don’t know why. Do I got a reason?”
65) 23) dialog: Yeah. I'd say, “Hey, Joey Zambooli, you think I got a reason to be pissed off with you? Gimme your top ten reasons you're a piece of shit and I'll let you know when somethin’ rings a bell. Just don’t lie to me and don’t figure me for one of your sissy-boys who’re gonna put out for you. I got the eyes in the front, the back and the side of my head and they all see twenty-twenty. Comprende, you sadly deformed excuse for humanity posing as a piece of prison garbage? You mess with Tony Nard-— (pause—he corrects himself) --no. You mess with Frankie Grinucci, you lose. He stops, a little startled by what just came out of him.
65) 25) dialog: * Yeah, you better thank me you piece of shit. You lying, two-bit punk-ass— The Casting Assistant stops Vince.
66) 0) text: The theater spot for actors, employed and unemployed. Vince and Molly sit at the bar. He drinks a beer. She drinks a Martini, astounded at the story he’s telling.
66) 2) dialog: Yeah, it was pretty cool, all right. (frowns ) But it was bullshit. Vince's cell rings. 71
66) 4) dialog: I made it sound like..you know..that’s the way I talk to the guys inside. (pause, then) That’s the way my son talks. Tony.
66) 6) dialog: Hello? Yeah, this is me. (pause—he looks confused) You want me to come back? Why, I forget something?
68) 0) text: Vince on the phone. what's happening. Molly is jumping up
68) 3) dialog: The other actors’1l be there? (pause) Yeah. I gotta take off work but..Wednesday should be fine... and down in her seat, mouthing the words: CALL BACK? CALL BACK?
68) 4) dialog: Okay. Sounds good. I’1l be there. Hey thank you. For everything there. And thank him for me too. Yeah. He hangs up. A strange pause. We 72
68) 7) dialog: Yeah, how ‘bout that. (pause) What’s wrong? MOLLY (pause, then) It’s an old theatrical adage. Everytime a friend succeeds, a little something in me dies. (shaking it off) No. It’s brilliant. It’s the way it has to be. We meet, to have coffee and tell secrets and for me to show you the advertisement in backstage that launches your career. After all, if I’m not making history, I at least want to be a part of it!
68) 8) dialog: I ain't exactly got the part yet. What if I screw up this call-back?
68) 10) dialog: Yeah. Then I'll probably get the job! bar rail and yells to the other patrons:
70) 0) text: Tony and Joyce in the car. They are still kissing. He begins to unbutton his pants. She helps him. But then she stops. Looks at him. As if to convince herself--
71) 0) text: Vince and Molly, having another round. They’ve had a few already and this, combined with the events of the day, are sending them into the orbits.
71) 2) dialog: Course, my daughter’s gonna go to law school. Maybe she could help out with the..deal. You know? (to bartender) Hey, encore here, huh? He makes a “two more” motion. The bartender starts mixing
71) 4) dialog: No, she don’t know nothin’. She thinks I gotta poker game.
73) 1) dialog: She ain’t gonna believe it. No matter what I say, she ain’t gonna believe it. Jesus. I gotta lot to back up and explain to her. Hard to know where to start. The new drinks arrive. They each sip, thinking.
80) 0) text: Magic Hour—a glorious summertime 7PM, where the sun hangs the air, slowly sinking. Molly and Vince stand at Island’ edge.
80) 2) dialog: About Tony? Well, you know the whole thing. You're the only one who does.
80) 4) dialog: Well, when I was ‘bout nineteen, I met Nan who was older. And she was hot for me and I was hot to get away from my family. We drank at the same bar. And before you know it..we were living at her place in Jersey. (pause, then) Strange how things happen when you're not even looking.
82) 0) text: Joyce is brushing her teeth. But she’s out of toothpaste. She opens a closet door and finds VINCE’S BOOK “An Actor Prepares”. She stares at it, suspiciously. Open it. Inside is a card, on which is written MOLLY CHARLESWORTH-917-463-3742. Joyce stares at the number, having at last found the enemy.
83) 0) text: Vince and Molly. VINCE (finishing his tale) And then the next things she’s pregnant and by then I knew she was bad news for me and I tried to get her to get rid of the kid. (remembering the moment) And she said to me: “I know you'll be leaving soon anyway. And I ain't get- ting left with nothing for myself.” And that’s how I knew she was having the kid and I had to just..do what I had to do. (pause, then) I had seventy-five hundred bucks saved from when I started working with my dad on his boat. It was gonna put me through City College. I sent it to her instead. Then I got hooked up with the prison 80 stuff—figured I needed a good steady income and pension. I never heard from Nan again.
83) 2) dialog: Nah. I didn’t wanna burden nobody else. Besides, I wasn’t too proud of taking off.
85) 0) text: Molly and Vince. She hangs up the cell. An odd look in he eye.
85) 2) dialog: I hate these things—I’m always getting’ wrong numbers.
85) 4) dialog: Of what? 8 MOLLY (smiles) Now, Vincent. Now’s the time. You do have it on you, don’t you? Vince’s face: blank for a moment. Then he realizes she means: the envelope! The secret! He pulls it out.
85) 5) dialog: Your secret? Yeah, course. (before he opens it) You sure? She nods. Doesn't take her eyes off him. He opens it. Ins is a single photograph.
85) 7) dialog: Who are they? MOLLY (beat, then) My three secrets. Vince takes this in-trying to connect the Molly he knows with the Molly that is being revealed. She looks him in t eye. Her looks says it all. He takes it in. Then, quietly
85) 8) dialog: Where are they?
85) 10) dialog: Schenectady? Upstate? What were you doin’ up there?
85) 12) dialog: Your family own some big business up there or somethin’? 82
89) 8) dialog: What the hell?
89) 10) dialog: She ain’t home. Maybe she went out for some food. They mount the stairs and enter the house.
90) 0) text: Vince and Molly in the living room. Vince unpacks his pockets of keys, change. Molly sits on the couch.
90) 1) dialog: Now I’m thinkin’, when she comes in I’m gonna say: "Joyce, it’s time we had a talk.” 89
90) 5) dialog: Trust me, twenty-years I’ve been with her. I know what I’m talkin’ about—
90) 7) dialog: Hey, you’re home! Joyce nods, face blank with shock and outrage.
90) 10) dialog: Molly here..well, we got somethin’ to tell you. (flustered—to Molly) Go ahead.
90) 13) dialog: Well..is it more important or less important than what we gotta tell?
90) 16) dialog: Joyce! What the—
90) 18) dialog: What are you talkin’ here?
90) 20) dialog: You did somethin’..with Tony?
90) 25) dialog: stumbles back into the room, dabbing his face with a wet cloth. What he sees is:

Vince’s voice pierces the walls. Vince Jr. sits up. VINCE JR. Dad? Concerned looks. He gets up and goes to the window. Denis and Cheryl follow. They look—

90) 41) dialog: 
90) 45) dialog: And yanks Tony to the ground.

90) 53) dialog: She’s not my girlfriend! Joyce looks up at Molly who, appalled, shakes her head. 95
90) 56) dialog: For the Scorsese movie with De Niro.
90) 58) dialog: That’s what I was trying to tell you! I’m gonna be in a Robert De Niro movie directed by Martin Scorsese! Beat. All look at each other, puzzled.
90) 62) dialog: Yeah and Molly here—well..she sorta... (pause, sigh, what the hell) she’s a friend of mine. We’re in acting class together. She told me to go this audition here so I went.
90) 64) dialog: 
90) 68) dialog: No, it’s the truth. And I wanted to tell you about it but I knew you'd be mad about lying to you about the class so Molly here said she’d come along and..pretend to be my manager! Joyce dismounts Vince. Stares at him. He stares back at her. So much frustration, jealousy, and sheer anger.
90) 70) dialog: You know what honey? I don’t give a shit! In fact, I don’t give two shits! You don’t believe me? Fine with me. You got a few things to answer for yourself, here. (he looks at Tony) What's goin’ on here?
90) 73) dialog: You keep your mouth shut, little girl. What are you doin’ running around with that animal in your robe there? Pause. From the ground:
90) 79) dialog: What's that got to do with her? Tony stares at Vivian, who looks back at him. Beat. She realizes it’s her turn now. Tension: Vince is preparing to whack Tony again. Vivian must come clean or he will be hurt! As Tony stars at her—

90) 92) dialog: No, I quit!
90) 94) dialog: I told you-I was a friend of your mothers!
90) 104) dialog: Honey..what happened here? Meaning Tony. Her eyes plead forgiveness back.
90) 106) dialog: I meant to tell you the whole thing, sweetie. Years ago. Really. There’s so much I been wanting to tell you. It just..never seems like the right time... Tears forming in their eyes.
90) 108) dialog: Sick? No. Scared of you maybe but not sick of you. You’re..you’re.. He looks around. Sees Molly. She pantomimes BREATHING DEEPLY. Vince remembers.
90) 109) dialog: You're the air that I breathe. They embrace each other. Oh, how they embrace. Like two people who are so happy to have each other back. Molly watches Vince and Joyce. Something in this moment is affecting her as well. Very gradually—
91) 3) dialog: Uh, yeah. She left town, I think. MALAKOV (shrugs) Hm. Well, class, you now have one less actor in New York City to worry about stealing your role. People applaud sarcastically. But not Vince. MALAKOV (cont. ) Vince? You ready? Vince stands and walks to the stage... He looks out at the faces in the audience. Seems calm and sure of himself. And, after taking a pause, he begins.
91) 4) dialog: You asked me my worst secret. My most personal secret. The secret of all my secrets. I get it. (pause, then) But first..I’m Vince Rizzo and I want to begin by telling you about where I live. Now we realize that the opening monologue was, in fact, a flashback from this point. Joyce Rizzo stands at the back the class. Looking at her husband with a different set of eyes.
91) 13) dialog: Somehow, with Tony’s appearance a lot of good things happened. I shoulda looked for him years ago. Everyone seated at the picnic table. Behind them the view of the water. New York City in the distance, clear as a friggin’ bell. The food is on heads. 105
91) 14) dialog: Every busy city needs an island of peace. Just as every busy soul needs a place of repose. Before, City Island was the place where I hid from my own life. (and then) Now it’s home. For everyone. What else you need? the plates. Grace time. Everyone bows their
91) 15) dialog: Yeah. We thank you for this meal here... And to show our faith and unity... a moment of silence. As Vince says Grace, we see their faces. Vince. Joyce. Vivian. Vince Jr. Tony. Vince and Joyce look at each other. This is their bond. This is their life.
91) 16) dialog: All right. Let’s eat! The Rizzo family starts passing the food. The water in th background and the distance. the forever majestic skyline of Manhattan in Ain't life grand?
