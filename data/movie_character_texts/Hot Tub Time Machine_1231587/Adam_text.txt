2) 17) dialog: I'm not sure.
2) 24) dialog: Oh! Jennie.
2) 26) dialog: She's nobody. Ski instructor. (off her look) You didn't know me yet. Lily still looks at him a little hard.
2) 27) dialog: Lily, I was 17. She had boobs and a face. Of course I'm gonna take her picture. Lily still looks a little bothered.
2) 29) dialog: Of course not! I think of you. As Adam goes to EMBRACE her:
2) 31) dialog: Sweetie? She comes out a moment later with a CARDBOARD BOX, which empties onto the BED. About FIFTY PORNO MAGAZINES spill o ranging from TITS MONTHLY to BLACK ASS.
2) 32) dialog: How did you know where I hid my... treasure? Lily carefully picks up a BROCHURE from the pile, holding by the corner, not wanting to touch it.
2) 39) dialog: OK! You caught me! I occasionally... reminisce... about Jennie O'Keefe!
2) 42) dialog: (without missing a beat) About two hours ago when you were on the phone with your mother.
2) 44) dialog: What are you so worried about?
2) 46) dialog: Baby, the girl in that picture was nothing more than a crush. I could never get her and there's no possibility I'll ever be with her. She was a total stranger. Lily gets a CURIOUS LOOK on her face.
2) 48) dialog: Well not the creepy "your mom was in an accident, now come with me" kind. But yeah, the hot lady in the supermarket kind of stranger. You have to admit - it's kinda hot.

3) 7) dialog: Yeah.
3) 10) dialog: Babe, look at Nick... In the car, Nick air drums to whatever's on the radio.
3) 11) dialog: You think with him in charge, we're gonna get into any kind of trouble? We'll probably eat too much pizza and I'll twist my ankle getting off the ski lift.
3) 13) dialog: Sandwich. Thanks. He puts it in his BACKPACK. She looks like she was expect a different reaction, but she lets it go. He kisses her.
3) 15) dialog: I told you, I'll call you when-- She snatches it out of his hands. Adam looks confused, as she pockets the phone.

66) 2) text: Jacob, I'm sorry for not always being the big brother I should've been. I was away at college, Mom gave you my Sega - there were a whole host of issues. Jacob nods and speaks genuinely to Adam too.    
66) 4) text: I know. I'm sorry too. I put a few things before my family and took my guilt out on you. (puts it together) I guess it was an inevitable I'd end up part of a roofie ring. Adam smiles and extends his hand. ADAM
66) 5) text: Friends? Jacob takes Adam's hand and helps him to his feet. JACOB

Adam has the finish line in his sights, when he rolls the dice once too often. His SNOWBOARD GETS SNAGGED on a rock and Adam TUMBLES TO THE GROUND.    
69) 0) text: As Adam tumbles on the ground, Blaine smiles, thinking he the victory in the bag. But instead of stopping, Adam picks up speed, as he TUMBL LIMB OVER LIMB, like a snowball going down the mountain. With 50 YARDS to go, Blaine bears down and tries to catch Adam. It's gonna be close. At the FINISH LINE, Adam's CRUMPLED BODY passes the line first. Blaine pulls up, pissed off to lose the race.
