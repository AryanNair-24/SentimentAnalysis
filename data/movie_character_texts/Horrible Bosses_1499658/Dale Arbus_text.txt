15) 5) dialog: Aww. You really like it?
15) 16) dialog: Well, you're my queen. I love you, Stacy.
18) 10) dialog: I'm fine. Thanks.
18) 14) dialog: Uh-huh.
18) 18) dialog: Thank you.
18) 22) dialog: Uh, no.
18) 37) dialog: Probe.
18) 39) dialog: What?
18) 43) dialog: Oh, right.
18) 48) dialog: Julia, please.
18) 66) dialog: Hey!
18) 70) dialog: All right, Julia, listen. You can't keep doing this.
18) 75) dialog: She's not my girlfriend anymore. Stacy and I got engaged last night.
18) 80) dialog: We're engaged.
18) 84) dialog: Hey!
18) 88) dialog: That's a horrible thing to say. I never said that!
22) 6) dialog: Wow. Sorry, man. He was like a dad to you.
22) 19) dialog: I thought he was giving you a promotion.
22) 23) dialog: Well, at least your boss doesn't sexually harass you.
22) 27) dialog: I'm telling you, she's out of control. It's a full-on hostile work environment.
22) 31) dialog: Today she sprayed my crotch with water so she could see the outline of my wiener.
22) 35) dialog: I'm engaged!
22) 39) dialog: Thank you.
22) 43) dialog: I can't apply for another job, remember?
22) 53) dialog: It was nighttime and I was peeing! And it's bullshit that I got put on the registered sex offender list for that!
22) 57) dialog: Why would they put a playground next to a bar anyway? That's entrapment.
22) 70) dialog: Man. He must be grieving all the time.
29) 3) dialog: You wanted to see --
29) 6) dialog: 
29) 11) dialog: Do I have to?
29) 16) dialog: Look, Julia, this is ridiculous --
29) 28) dialog: Now. Right now.
29) 32) dialog: You're naked, Julia!
29) 36) dialog: Okay, right there! Just saying `pussy' to me. That's over the line.
29) 40) dialog: Again! Naked, `pussy,' `faggot.' All over the line. And probably
29) 45) dialog: It was an empty playground! In the middle of the night!
29) 55) dialog: I'm not going to sleep with you, Julia.
30) 7) dialog: She stood there with her breasts right in my face.
30) 12) dialog: Why don't you guys quit? It's not like you're sex offenders.
30) 24) dialog: The world is your oyster.
30) 30) dialog: I heard you moved to New York to work at Lehman Brothers or something.
30) 46) dialog: Easy, Kenny.
30) 51) dialog: Uh, sure. Here's a few bucks, Kenny.
31) 5) dialog: What do you mean?
31) 16) dialog: Jeez.
31) 25) dialog: You guys are sick.
31) 36) dialog: Me too.
31) 41) dialog: Consider what?
31) 45) dialog: (laughing it off) Yeah, right.
31) 58) dialog: Yeah, shut up, Kurt.
31) 63) dialog: Well, first of all, killing someone is illegal and immoral --
31) 72) dialog: I can't believe you guys are actually talking about this. I don't care how bad our bosses are. We're not murderers.
31) 83) dialog: What you guys are talking about is wrong and you know it.
31) 89) dialog: She's not ruining my life. If anything's ruining my life it's you guys and your drunk bullshit.
31) 94) dialog: I don't want to do it. And when you sober up neither will you. We're not killing anyone.
32) 13) dialog: 
32) 17) dialog: Stacy?!
32) 21) dialog: For... nothing. What are you doing here?
32) 30) dialog: 
32) 35) dialog: We don't want to take advantage of Julia.
32) 44) dialog: Wait -- no gas. She doesn't need to be out.
33) 8) dialog: Hey! Stop it, what are you -- ?
33) 12) dialog: 
33) 16) dialog: I knew you only brought her in here to mess with me.
33) 26) dialog: All right, that's it, Julia. This is over. You're out of your mind. I quit!
33) 31) dialog: What?
33) 35) dialog: Tell her whatever you want. She'd never believe you.
33) 40) dialog: What is that?
33) 44) dialog: 
33) 60) dialog: 
33) 65) dialog: How did you make it look like I was awake?
33) 69) dialog: This is rape! You raped me!
34) 3) dialog: Let's kill the bitch.
34) 9) dialog: My boss. Our bosses. They need to die.
34) 14) dialog: That was before Julia tried to fuck me on top of my fiancГ©e's unconscious body.
34) 18) dialog: I say we kill them all. Are you guys in or out?
34) 22) dialog: Yes! Nick?
34) 50) dialog: I was thinking about that on my way over. Stacy and I watch a lot of `Law &amp; Order' and there's a ton of ways criminals mess up. Things we'd never think of. They leave behind clothing fibers, bullet casings, hair, skin cells --
34) 54) dialog: Exactly. And that's why we need a professional.
34) 66) dialog: Maybe you do, moneybags.
34) 70) dialog: That's the only problem. I have no idea.
34) 79) dialog: What people?
35) 14) dialog: Craigslist?! You found a hitman on Craigslist.
35) 23) dialog: This is so dangerous. What if he's a narc?
35) 29) dialog: What do we do if this guy gets here and he asks for so much money that we can't afford him and he gets mad and kills all of us?
35) 47) dialog: I bet that briefcase has one of those guns you have to screw together.
35) 62) dialog: (whispering to Nick) Oh my God, he's like James Bond!
35) 76) dialog: No, no! We definitely don't want to record this, sir.
35) 87) dialog: 
35) 115) dialog: Please don't kill us.
36) 12) dialog: What's that?
36) 18) dialog: Oh, come on!
38) 7) dialog: Now, `Gregory.' Is that your real name?
38) 29) dialog: Thank you, Gregory./Thanks, Gregory.
39) 5) dialog: Aren't you worried about your car?
40) 10) dialog: You said they were the lowest of the low.
40) 32) dialog: (head in hands) Oh my God.
40) 48) dialog: I vote we go.
41) 3) dialog: This is ridiculous. We're never gonna find someone to do this for us.
41) 11) dialog: Oh, we're just gonna follow him into that alley?... All right.
42) 17) dialog: Your first name is Cocksucker?
42) 21) dialog: No, no. It's just interesting. That's the name on your birth certificate?
42) 25) dialog: Oh! Like Dean Jones. The actor from Herbie the Love Bug.
42) 39) dialog: Not `motherfucker'?
42) 57) dialog: Isn't there any kind of discount because we're buying three at once? Like buy two, get one free.
42) 70) dialog: Wow.
42) 91) dialog: Or plastic. I read an article that plastic is actually better for the environment than paper.
42) 101) dialog: Should we deduct the cost of the briefcase?
42) 105) dialog: I mean, assuming we don't get the case back... We're not getting the case back, right?
42) 108) dialog: Well, that's like an extra eighty bucks. Only seems fair that we should take that out of your end.
42) 112) dialog: Then let's get a cheap one. It doesn't have to be real leather. (then to Cocksucker) Are you cool with faux -- ?
43) 5) dialog: Turns out we didn't really need the briefcase after all. Could've just used a manila envelope.
43) 19) dialog: I knew we were getting ripped off!
43) 35) dialog: Whoa, whoa! We don't want any trouble.
43) 53) dialog: You're talking about surveillance and recon.
43) 61) dialog: Hey, that's a good idea. Like Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train.
43) 65) dialog: Yes, the famous Alfred Hitchcock/Danny DeVito movie. You're thinking of Throw Mama from the Train. But it's actually the same idea. If we kill each other's bosses there's no link to us.
47) 6) dialog: Hells yeah!
48) 5) dialog: I don't get it. On TV, surveillance always looks so great. They've got their cups of coffee. Their sunflower seeds. They talk about their lives.
48) 12) dialog: And then, right when they reveal something really intimate, the perp appears and they spring into action.
49) 6) dialog: What are you doing?
49) 10) dialog: What about fingerprints? We don't have gloves.
50) 4) dialog: Got it. Wait, I don't know what he looks like.
50) 8) dialog: Got it.
50) 20) dialog: Hey, Nick? Does this count as intel?
50) 25) dialog: God, this must be worth, like, ten thousand -- oh shit!
50) 35) dialog: Sorry, my sleeves were slippery!
50) 39) dialog: I've got it.
53) 13) dialog: I guess we should've emptied the Dustbuster before we used it.
55) 3) dialog: Hey look, there's a piece of cereal in here. Can't tell if that's a corn flake or a frosted flake...
56) 14) dialog: You stole that from Pellit's house?
56) 18) dialog: 
58) 2) dialog: What did you need to get?
58) 7) dialog: Nice.
58) 19) dialog: Y'know... this is kinda, I don't know... exciting.
58) 26) dialog: 
60) 3) dialog: Can I have a pair?
60) 7) dialog: Okay -- again, I don't know what he looks like.
60) 11) dialog: Fine. I'll honk the horn six times.
60) 19) dialog: Honk the horn four times?
60) 23) dialog: People honk once all the time. You'll be running in and out of the house.
60) 27) dialog: 
63) 3) dialog: (singing a la Cher,
65) 3) dialog: C'mon, c'mon... yes!
66) 11) dialog: Excuse me?
66) 15) dialog: Oh, I'm sorry, that blew out the window. I wasn't littering.
66) 19) dialog: Whoa. Sir, there's no need to be hostile.
66) 24) dialog: Get your what?
66) 30) dialog: Huh? Oh, yeah. It was a peanut butter sandwich.
66) 33) dialog: Oh god! What should I do?! Tell me what to do!
66) 40) dialog: What do I do with this? Should I inject you?!
66) 43) dialog: Okay, hold on! I got this.
66) 46) dialog: Did I do it? Did I get enough in?! I'm gonna do it again!
68) 5) dialog: He had an allergic reaction. But I think he's coming around. Do you know him?
68) 15) dialog: I injected you with your thing.
68) 24) dialog: Oh, it was nothing.
68) 41) dialog: 
69) 27) dialog: Oh good. You guys are here. Did you see me out there?
69) 31) dialog: Pretty neat, huh?
69) 37) dialog: Wait, that was Harken?
69) 41) dialog: I wasn't stabbing anybody. That was an epi-pen. He was having an allergic reaction to peanuts and I injected him.
69) 48) dialog: Wait, you were just mad at me for killing him and now you're mad at me for not killing him?!
69) 63) dialog: But Harken must always have that epi-pen on him.
69) 70) dialog: That just leaves Julia.
69) 76) dialog: I can do that.
77) 14) dialog: Harken just left his house. I'm going in.
77) 18) dialog: Thanks.
78) 3) dialog: Ahhh!
80) 2) dialog: 
80) 12) dialog: I'm not sure if I can do this.
80) 16) dialog: In Harken's bathroom. About to pour the nuts in his shampoo. But, I just... I know he's a real shithead, but he's still a person, y'know?
80) 23) dialog: What should I do? Should I do it?
80) 29) dialog: What?
80) 33) dialog: At Pellit's?! Why?!
80) 37) dialog: How would Harken even know Pellit? 82.
82) 5) dialog: What? What? What?!
82) 9) dialog: Oh my god. Is he dead?!
84) 2) dialog: What's happening?
84) 10) dialog: What about Pellit?
84) 14) dialog: Shit! What do we do?!
86) 15) dialog: Me neither.
86) 30) dialog: `Afterwards'?
86) 35) dialog: 
90) 6) dialog: You're not a rapscallion. You're a whore. A filthy whore.
93) 3) dialog: They know everything. We're dead. I can't believe I let you guys talk me into this!
93) 20) dialog: You broke into two people's houses and stole a BlackBerry!
93) 24) dialog: Well, since I'm the only one without a connection to the murder, yeah, maybe I will.
94) 37) dialog: 
94) 48) dialog: 
94) 68) dialog: Okay wait!
94) 71) dialog: Saying that we'll be here for a long time implies that we can't leave. Does that mean we're under arrest?
94) 76) dialog: So, you don't have evidence constituting probable cause to arrest us?
94) 80) dialog: Well then, we're free to go?
94) 85) dialog: Come on, guys.
95) 13) dialog: `Law &amp; Order.'
96) 12) dialog: I don't have money for a lawyer. I gave all my money to Cocksucker Jones!
96) 18) dialog: Actually, it was five thousand forty with the briefcase.
97) 18) dialog: We don't even know why it happened. But the cops brought us in as suspects. What do we do now?
97) 27) dialog: 
97) 36) dialog: That's horrible.
97) 61) dialog: What was it?
97) 67) dialog: Yes.
97) 83) dialog: If you're not a murderer, why do you carry that gun on your belt?
101) 12) dialog: Fresh batteries, fresh six-hour tape, voice activated.
101) 23) dialog: So what do we do now? Wait for Harken to come home and ambush him?
101) 29) dialog: Hey, we should find an office chair so one of us can dramatically spin around and face Harken.
101) 42) dialog: We could try and find more than one office chair so the three of us can spin around at the same time.
101) 46) dialog: I guess you're right. I'll turn on the lamp.
103) 19) dialog: Uh, yes. How's he doing?
103) 70) dialog: You guys ready?
104) 19) dialog: 
104) 31) dialog: The guy you killed. What was his name?
104) 57) dialog: 
105) 14) dialog: More than once! Then he told us we were dead men! He's getting his gun right now!
106) 15) dialog: Is there anything you don't wax?
111) 4) dialog: What?!
111) 12) dialog: Everyone flees to Mexico. That's the first place they'll look.
111) 25) dialog: 
112) 5) dialog: Oh God. Look, Julia, I can't talk right now --
112) 10) dialog: No! Wait!
112) 14) dialog: I'm not playing. I'm going to do it. I swear!
112) 18) dialog: Fine!
112) 22) dialog: I'm going to... have sex with you.
112) 26) dialog: Right now? You want me to say it?
112) 43) dialog: 
112) 49) dialog: 
112) 57) dialog: Yes! Yes! I'm going to beat your face with my cock!
112) 69) dialog: 
112) 76) dialog: Nice job `fucking the crazy out of her,' Kurt!
112) 99) dialog: They think we murdered someone.
112) 116) dialog: I thought you were our friend, Gregory!
113) 8) dialog: Shit, shit, shit...
113) 22) dialog: 
113) 73) dialog: 
117) 5) dialog: 
117) 15) dialog: Could we do it on top of the patient? I like the element of danger.
117) 24) dialog: Oh, yeah.
117) 38) dialog: Julia, meet my old high school friend, Kenny.
117) 49) dialog: Kenny will do just about anything for fifty bucks and that's why I hired him to help me frame you. Your days of sexually assaulting me and your patients are over.
117) 54) dialog: Three losers.
117) 59) dialog: Shut up, Julia. Now, my fiancee and I are going to take a very expensive two week vacation which you're going to pay for. And then I'm going to come back to a rape- free workplace. Because if you so much as look at my ass, I'll have yours locked up.
