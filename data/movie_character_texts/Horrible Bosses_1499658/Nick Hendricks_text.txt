4) 3) dialog: Damn.
9) 6) dialog: 
9) 11) dialog: Yeah, sorry. This is like the only time I have to make any personal calls. I just wanted to see if you felt like going out again because I had a great time with you on our last date.
9) 15) dialog: I know and that's my bad. I've been swamped at work --
9) 19) dialog: Right. Well, I'm up for a promotion which will give me a lot more free time --
11) 3) dialog: Fuck!
12) 6) dialog: Yes?
13) 6) dialog: I don't know, Mr. Harken. I might have been a minute late.
13) 10) dialog: Okay, I might have been two minutes late.
13) 15) dialog: No, I --
13) 18) dialog: Who are you calling?
13) 28) dialog: Wait! Okay, I guess I lied. But I didn't mean to --
13) 32) dialog: I understand. You can trust me.
13) 47) dialog: 
13) 53) dialog: I don't.
13) 57) dialog: What?! No!
13) 66) dialog: None taken.
13) 73) dialog: It's 8:15.
13) 77) dialog: 
13) 81) dialog: Thank you.
13) 86) dialog: Aren't you having one?
13) 90) dialog: Oh. Well, I only took it because I thought you were having one.
13) 99) dialog: Well, I --
13) 103) dialog: 
13) 108) dialog: 
13) 113) dialog: (huh?) Got it.
22) 11) dialog: That sucks. You were the only one of us who didn't totally hate his job.
22) 21) dialog: He is. And he's got to do it before the General Meeting next week.
22) 41) dialog: There's gotta be other dental hygienist jobs out there.
22) 51) dialog: He's not a child molester. He just took his dick out in a playground.
22) 65) dialog: I thought you were all broken up about your boss dying.
23) 3) dialog: He did say ten o'clock, right?
23) 12) dialog: It just said `staff meeting' on the memo.
23) 20) dialog: You don't. Of course you don't. I'm sorry --
23) 24) dialog: I don't have a --
23) 46) dialog: I simulated a number of sales cycles, factoring in likely end- users, point-of-sale limitations and specific demographic variables.
23) 50) dialog: And in my opinion, an open plan selling process in our top 30 markets along with targeted upgrade offers to existing customers promises the greatest yield.
23) 62) dialog: What?
24) 3) dialog: Mr. Harken, can I speak to you?
24) 7) dialog: You've been hinting for months that I was in line for that promotion.
24) 11) dialog: So you've just been lying to me?
24) 22) dialog: (barely keeping it
24) 27) dialog: My grandmother. I told you I needed to see her but you said I'd be fired if I left early. She died before I could get to the hospital.
24) 34) dialog: I've been in that position for eight years now. Why would I stay here after being treated like this?!
24) 38) dialog: What?
24) 45) dialog: But that's not true! You can't do this!
30) 3) dialog: I feel like a total sucker. Harken was never planning on promoting me.
30) 19) dialog: It's true. I mean, I'm young. I could go back to school, change fields.
30) 28) dialog: I don't believe it. Kenny Orkin!
30) 38) dialog: You? Waiting tables? You were voted Most Likely to Succeed. Everyone thought you were set.
31) 10) dialog: You do that too?
31) 14) dialog: The other day I imagined shoving one of those jugs from the water cooler in Harken's mouth and making him drink until his bladder explodes.
31) 29) dialog: Yeah, Dale. It's not like we're actually going to kill our bosses.
31) 34) dialog: Well, of course. It's the one thing that keeps me from being happy.
31) 47) dialog: Very funny.
31) 56) dialog: Shut up, Kurt.
31) 68) dialog: I didn't get to say goodbye to Gam Gam because of Harken.
31) 74) dialog: No, we're not, Dale. We're just trying to live our lives. But what are we supposed to do when someone makes it impossible for us to live our lives? Do we just bend over and take it up the ass forever?
31) 85) dialog: Julia's ruining your life. That's wrong.
31) 100) dialog: 
34) 7) dialog: What bitch?
34) 12) dialog: We were drunk last night, man. And didn't you say killing was wrong?
34) 27) dialog: Gam Gam.
34) 37) dialog: Probably not kill him.
34) 41) dialog: I want him to die.
34) 45) dialog: Okay, I'm in.
34) 56) dialog: What are you talking about, a hitman?
34) 68) dialog: But where are we supposed to find a hitman?
34) 75) dialog: Why would anyone follow us?
35) 5) dialog: Wait. You actually found someone?!
35) 19) dialog: `Skilled professional with years of experience in domestic and international wet work. Fast and discreet. No children or political figures.'
35) 25) dialog: Yeah, Kurt. Call him back and cancel.
35) 33) dialog: (looking out window) Guys! I think this is him!
35) 43) dialog: Nice car.
35) 49) dialog: All right, let's just be professional here. We don't want to seem all giddy.
35) 55) dialog: 
35) 72) dialog: Yes, we are.
35) 85) dialog: We don't want you to kill us!
35) 97) dialog: What?!
35) 106) dialog: 
35) 111) dialog: You are such a moron.
36) 5) dialog: That's big of you.
36) 20) dialog: 
38) 3) dialog: So, do you like living in Bangalore?
38) 15) dialog: Why don't they let you use your real name?
38) 29) dialog: Thank you, Gregory./Thanks, Gregory.
39) 9) dialog: You really think we're gonna find a hitman in there?
40) 3) dialog: Oh, real nice, Kurt. Way to be racist.
40) 14) dialog: So what do we do now? Yell out `anyone here kill people for money?'
40) 24) dialog: Kurt!
40) 44) dialog: Maybe we should go?
42) 8) dialog: Yes, we are. Are you a... businessman?
42) 13) dialog: (unsure whether to take his hand) Excuse me?
42) 31) dialog: So you chose `cocksucker'?
42) 45) dialog: Okay, here's the thing: we each work for a boss that we need to get rid of. Is that something you might be able to help us with?
42) 53) dialog: That's a lot of cheese.
42) 61) dialog: There's no way we can pay that.
42) 73) dialog: That's a lot more reasonable. And that would be for all three, Cocksucker?
42) 81) dialog: Should we bring the bills in any kind of special denominations?
42) 85) dialog: Got it.
42) 89) dialog: Or a paper bag?
42) 95) dialog: Got it. Thanks. Come on, guys.
42) 110) dialog: We'll cover the briefcase, Dale.
43) 9) dialog: So, Cocksucker, how long do you think it'll be before you've... taken care of business?
43) 17) dialog: We don't want a murder consultant. We want a murderer.
43) 30) dialog: That's five thousand dollars. You think we're just gonna walk away and let you keep that?
43) 43) dialog: That makes sense. But how would we fake three accidents?
43) 57) dialog: Well, we all have obvious motives for killing our bosses.
43) 67) dialog: That's pretty good.
45) 5) dialog: Yeah. I just need to get Harken to let me leave early.
45) 9) dialog: 
45) 16) dialog: 
45) 22) dialog: Oh, okay. Thank you, Mr. Harken.
47) 4) dialog: Oh, it's on.
48) 15) dialog: Are we even sure he's home?
49) 3) dialog: I don't see him.
50) 6) dialog: It doesn't matter. Just tell us if anyone comes.
50) 13) dialog: Okay, let's split up. Look for any intel we can use on him.
50) 17) dialog: I don't know. I guess we'll know it when we see it.
50) 23) dialog: Holy shit, that's a lot of blow.
50) 33) dialog: What the fuck?!!
50) 37) dialog: We've got to get that back in the box.
53) 3) dialog: Look out. Let me try this.
53) 15) dialog: You think?
56) 3) dialog: We need to be better prepared. That was totally dangerous and a complete waste of time.
56) 8) dialog: Oh no... don't tell me...
56) 23) dialog: I guess so. But let's make a stop first.
58) 5) dialog: No more sleeve gloves.
58) 12) dialog: Take a right up here. Harken's place is about a mile away.
58) 23) dialog: (a little smile) Yeah.
60) 5) dialog: You know, last time with the three of us, it got a little... messy. What if Kurt and I go in and you stay here and watch out for Harken?
60) 9) dialog: If anyone approaches the house, assume it's him and give us a signal.
60) 21) dialog: How about you just honk once?
61) 3) dialog: 
61) 10) dialog: Kurt, wait!
61) 15) dialog: No, it's one of those hide-a-key things. Look...
62) 3) dialog: Wow. This is not how I pictured his place.
62) 8) dialog: Jesus!
64) 11) dialog: I think that was the same one.
64) 18) dialog: You want to cover every woman in... did you say `cock yogurt'?
64) 25) dialog: If he's so scared of us, why doesn't he just leave us alone?!
67) 3) dialog: Do you see a Day Runner or an address book?
67) 10) dialog: 
67) 20) dialog: What the hell is he thinking?!
67) 24) dialog: What about Dale?
67) 28) dialog: Right. Let's go through the back!
69) 3) dialog: I can't believe that idiot Dale. You realize we're all going to jail because of him.
69) 7) dialog: Yeah, me too.
69) 12) dialog: What do you mean `well'? I'd get raped just as much as you.
69) 17) dialog: You think you're more rape-able than I am.
69) 33) dialog: No, it wasn't neat! You stabbed Harken to death in front of the whole neighborhood!
69) 39) dialog: Who'd you think you were stabbing?
69) 44) dialog: So let me understand this. My boss, who we are trying to kill, was dying in front of you and you saved his life?
69) 56) dialog: Hang on a sec. Maybe this recon wasn't a waste of time. Now we know Harken's deathly allergic to peanuts and Pellit has a huge stash of cocaine.
69) 61) dialog: Everyone would assume that Pellit just got a batch of tainted drugs.
69) 68) dialog: Perfect! Two fatal accidents. And we're not even there when they happen.
69) 74) dialog: Good. I'll get some rat poison and take care of Pellit. Dale, think you can get some peanuts into Harken's shampoo?
69) 85) dialog: What's that?
72) 4) dialog: 
72) 9) dialog: I'm just waiting for Pellit to go to sleep. I wonder how Dale's doing with Harken. 79.
77) 3) dialog: Jesus, where does he get the energy?
77) 9) dialog: What's up, Dale?
77) 16) dialog: Good luck, man.
79) 3) dialog: Okay. Here we go.
80) 5) dialog: What?
80) 14) dialog: Where are you?
80) 19) dialog: (looking down at the rat poison,
80) 26) dialog: 
80) 31) dialog: It's Harken. He's here!
80) 35) dialog: I don't know. He's knocking on his door!
82) 3) dialog: Oh my god oh my god oh my god...
82) 7) dialog: He shot him. Harken shot Pellit!
82) 11) dialog: Shhhh!
82) 14) dialog: 
84) 4) dialog: Harken's gone.
84) 12) dialog: He's not moving. He looks dead.
84) 16) dialog: I've got to get out of here before someone sees me! Meet me at the bar. I'll call Kurt.
86) 5) dialog: Calm? How can we be calm? I watched a man die an hour ago!
86) 9) dialog: Well...
86) 13) dialog: I don't know if I had it in me.
86) 24) dialog: You think when it came down to it, you would've been able to murder Julia?
86) 33) dialog: You slept with her, didn't you?
86) 39) dialog: You are a mess.
90) 2) dialog: There is something clinically wrong with you.
90) 10) dialog: Whatever. We have bigger fish to fry right now. What do we do about Harken?
90) 14) dialog: Okay, but we should find a payphone. We don't want them tracing the call to us.
91) 3) dialog: Come on, we'll take my car.
92) 3) dialog: What the hell?
92) 8) dialog: Uh, yes. Is there something wrong?
92) 12) dialog: Can I ask why?
93) 12) dialog: We can't even say anything about Harken now.
93) 16) dialog: Uh, well, Kurt, being outside the murder victim's house because I was planning to murder him probably isn't the best alibi in the world.
93) 26) dialog: That means you'd also rat on me.
94) 12) dialog: I... was drag racing. (off their skeptical
94) 19) dialog: I don't win a lot.
94) 44) dialog: Where were you during the murder?
95) 10) dialog: 
95) 17) dialog: `We'? You were gonna turn us in!
96) 10) dialog: Maybe it's time to lawyer up.
96) 16) dialog: We did pay him five thousand dollars to be our murder consultant.
97) 7) dialog: One of our intended victims killed another of our intended victims.
97) 32) dialog: No. They don't suspect him.
97) 47) dialog: 
97) 53) dialog: What?
97) 66) dialog: No.
97) 71) dialog: You did ten years for video piracy?
97) 91) dialog: I feel like such a moron.
101) 14) dialog: One of us needs to tape it to our chest.
101) 18) dialog: That's `cause you shave it.
101) 25) dialog: I have a better idea. Let's be in the house when he walks in. He'll be so mad, he'll be more likely to confess.
101) 31) dialog: I'll be in the chair.
101) 40) dialog: He's my boss.
101) 50) dialog: You're recording it all. You're the most important member of the team.
103) 13) dialog: Uh... hi... sorry we're late. I'm Nick. I work with your husband
103) 68) dialog: He's going off alone. This is our chance.
103) 74) dialog: Okay, stay close.
104) 8) dialog: We know what you did, Harken.
104) 12) dialog: We were there. We saw you kill him.
104) 35) dialog: There it is! (turning to Dale) Let's go, guys --
104) 40) dialog: Hang on. Hold that thought, because I want to get my friend,
104) 45) dialog: (looking back at the
104) 61) dialog: What are you doing? What's in that?
105) 3) dialog: We had him! We had the whole thing. What happened to Kurt?
105) 8) dialog: `Hey'?! Where were you?!
105) 12) dialog: You're too late, Kurt! He confessed the whole damn thing!
105) 21) dialog: Yeah, you --
105) 24) dialog: (realizing what Kurt
106) 22) dialog: Ugh. Turn it off, Dale!
111) 8) dialog: Where are we going to go?
111) 16) dialog: What the fuck are you talking about?
111) 20) dialog: What if I was destined to smack you right in the face?
112) 36) dialog: It's Harken! Lose him!
112) 53) dialog: Jesus Christ, this guy's nuts!
112) 92) dialog: No, wait! Don't call the police! They're already after us.
112) 102) dialog: Why are you slowing down?!
112) 119) dialog: He's not stopping!
113) 17) dialog: Look, Mr. Harken --
113) 30) dialog: What the -- ?!
113) 69) dialog: I think this is gonna work out okay for us.
113) 78) dialog: I've got this. (looking to heaven) This is for you, Gam Gam.
118) 8) dialog: Hi, Carter. Just wanted to check if you had a chance to finish those regional sales projections yet?
118) 12) dialog: Okay. I was hoping to give them to the marketing guys today, but I can hold them off.
119) 11) dialog: Thanks, buddy.
119) 14) dialog: It's good to be the boss.
