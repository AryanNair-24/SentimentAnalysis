20) 5) dialog: 
20) 11) dialog: This is one of those hidden camera shows, isn't it?
20) 15) dialog: Come on. You're way too good- looking to be a UPS girl. What are you, a model? An actress? What's gonna happen when I open this box? Is something going to jump out at me?
20) 27) dialog: Shut up.
20) 32) dialog: Well, then, I need to take you out to dinner.
20) 36) dialog: Because I want to be able to tell my friends that I took out the hottest UPS girl in America. Come on, what do you say?
20) 39) dialog: Awesome. I'm Kurt.
20) 43) dialog: Pretty name. How's Tuesday? Macaroni Grill?
20) 47) dialog: See you then, Myrna.
20) 56) dialog: Hey, Jack. Yeah, just doing my part for the women of America.
20) 61) dialog: That sounds a lot more innocent than `sex addict.'
20) 68) dialog: Last quarter's profits? I ran the numbers. We're down by 11 percent year-to-year.
20) 72) dialog: Well, I know you don't want to cut
20) 78) dialog: There's also the issue of our hazardous waste disposal. We're paying a lot right now and the Bolivians have come back with a very good offer.
20) 87) dialog: No, I wouldn't.
21) 5) dialog: You kidding? It's the best job in the world.
22) 3) dialog: He died instantly. They say his heart burst in his chest like a water balloon.
22) 8) dialog: I loved him. And I loved working for him. And now his idiot son is gonna be in charge. You know how many times I've caught him doing blow at work?
22) 25) dialog: This again?
22) 29) dialog: She's a woman who wants to have sex with you. How bad can it be?
22) 33) dialog: Why don't you just fuck her?
22) 37) dialog: Oh yeah. Congratulations, by the way.
22) 45) dialog: Oh, right. Because you'd have to tell them you're a child molester.
22) 55) dialog: It worked out. Julia probably hired you because she's a sexual deviant herself.
22) 60) dialog: 
22) 67) dialog: This is how I grieve, okay?
25) 6) dialog: What?
25) 10) dialog: I was at your father's funeral.
25) 14) dialog: That excuse wouldn't have made any sense when your dad was here.
26) 8) dialog: It's not in the crapper. It's a recession. But we're still profitable.
26) 13) dialog: Your father made the decision to pay a little more to dispose of our chemical waste responsibly.
26) 17) dialog: But that would endanger thousands of local residents.
26) 25) dialog: They're not tribesmen. It's a
26) 40) dialog: (snapping out of it) What do you mean?
26) 45) dialog: Margie's not fat. She's pregnant. I'm not firing her.
26) 54) dialog: Hank?
26) 58) dialog: I'm not firing anyone! It's like you don't care about this company at all.
27) 6) dialog: What are you -- ?!
27) 14) dialog: Look, Hank, this was not my --
30) 5) dialog: That coked-out douchebag is gonna destroy Pellit Chemicals.
30) 10) dialog: You know, yours just doesn't sound that bad.
30) 22) dialog: Yeah. Why should I care about protecting Pellit's name when his own son doesn't? There's a million jobs out there.
30) 34) dialog: So what are you doing back here?
30) 56) dialog: You're gay now?
31) 3) dialog: So I guess we're just gonna be miserable for the rest of our lives.
31) 7) dialog: What options do we have? We can quit our jobs and turn into Kenny. Or keep our jobs and turn into sad, ball-less losers who spend their days dreaming of ways to kill their bosses.
31) 12) dialog: Of course. Everyone does. It's the only thing that keeps us from going totally bat-shit.
31) 18) dialog: That's so funny. I had the same idea for Pellit.
31) 23) dialog: Only using gasoline instead of water. And his ass instead of his mouth.
31) 27) dialog: What's sick about it? It's just a way to let off steam.
31) 32) dialog: You have to admit though, our lives would be a lot better if our bosses were dead.
31) 39) dialog: Let's just consider this, for one second.
31) 43) dialog: Killing our bosses. I'm just being hypothetical here.
31) 49) dialog: Well, it's not like they're gonna live forever. These pieces of shit are going to die someday.
31) 54) dialog: We'd just be accelerating that natural process.
31) 60) dialog: 
31) 65) dialog: It may be illegal but I'm not sure it's immoral. Sometimes one evil person has to die for the greater good of the community. If Bobby Pellit has his way, hundreds, maybe thousands of innocent Bolivians will suffer. It would actually be immoral not to kill him.
31) 70) dialog: Exactly! Who knows how many other Gam Gams have died alone.
31) 81) dialog: No, we do not!
31) 87) dialog: Yeah!
31) 91) dialog: If it's bullshit, Dale, then how come we all want to do it so much?
31) 97) dialog: 
34) 5) dialog: Huh?
34) 16) dialog: Whoa!
34) 20) dialog: I was in last night.
34) 25) dialog: Look at her. Look at Bubby.
34) 35) dialog: Look at Gam Gam. Getting a smooch from her favorite grandson. Little does she know that she'll never get to say goodbye to him. And why? Because his shithead boss wouldn't let him leave. What would Gam Gam want you to do?
34) 39) dialog: This isn't about Gam Gam. This is about you. What do you want, Nick?
34) 43) dialog: Damn straight!
34) 47) dialog: All right! Let's do this.
34) 52) dialog: Skin cells?! I can't even keep track of my keys!
34) 64) dialog: You know, that's not bad. I mean, we don't clean our own apartments, right? We hire someone to clean them for us.
34) 73) dialog: I do. Meet at my place tomorrow after work. And make sure you're not followed.
34) 77) dialog: I don't know. People get followed.
34) 81) dialog: Just meet me at my place.
35) 3) dialog: Come in. The guy should be here pretty soon.
35) 7) dialog: It was as easy as buying a used futon.
35) 16) dialog: Yup. But they don't post it as `hitman.' That would be stupid. They use code words, like `liquidation,' `pest control,' `wet work.' Check it out. This is our guy.
35) 21) dialog: See? He's principled.
35) 27) dialog: It's too late. He's on his way.
35) 31) dialog: I don't think he'd stay in business long if he killed everyone who couldn't afford him.
35) 45) dialog: Whoa. This guy's legit.
35) 52) dialog: 
35) 64) dialog: (to the Man) Yes, hi, I'm Kurt. Please come in.
35) 81) dialog: Whoa, whoa. What's that for?
35) 93) dialog: Your ad said you do wet work.
35) 97) dialog: What?!
35) 109) dialog: Yeah! We're men seeking a man, aren't we?
35) 119) dialog: 
35) 123) dialog: Good thing I didn't call the guy who was offering to do `dirty work.'
36) 3) dialog: All right, I'll take the blame for that one.
36) 7) dialog: I'm going to make it up to you. I figured out a much better way to find a contract killer.
36) 25) dialog: Gregory, I need you to direct me to the most dangerous bar in Los Angeles.
36) 29) dialog: We need to find the bar with the most scumbags, lowlifes and hardcore shitheads. Can you help us out?
36) 34) dialog: Okay, Gregory? That's unhelpful. While I'm sure there are plenty of shitheads there, they're not the kind of shitheads we need.
36) 42) dialog: Now we're talking.
38) 11) dialog: Atmanand? How did you get Gregory from that?
38) 19) dialog: Actually, I do find Atmanand a little off-putting.
39) 3) dialog: This must be the place.
39) 7) dialog: Nah, Gregory's watching it.
39) 11) dialog: I think we're gonna have a hard time deciding between all the hitmen in there. Trust me, these are the lowest of the low.
40) 5) dialog: This isn't a race thing. We need a criminal and this neighborhood is where they live. I'm not saying that's because there are a lot of black people here. That's the fault of our society that discriminates and disenfranchises them.
40) 12) dialog: I was speaking socio-economically.
40) 16) dialog: Let me handle this.
40) 21) dialog: Hey. How you doing? Nice place.
40) 29) dialog: Don't get me wrong. This isn't about race. Our society discriminates and disenfranchises
40) 36) dialog: I didn't mean you in particular.
40) 51) dialog: Okay, we're going. I'm sorry if I offended you. It was never my --
40) 55) dialog: Okey doke.
42) 27) dialog: (quietly to Dale) I don't think he knows who Dean Jones is.
42) 43) dialog: I agree.
42) 49) dialog: We've got cheese. How much cheese are we talking?
42) 55) dialog: We don't have that much cheese.
42) 77) dialog: Great. We're in.
42) 87) dialog: And do you want it in any particular container, like a shoebox?
43) 7) dialog: Shut up, Dale.
43) 13) dialog: You told us you could take care of it.
43) 21) dialog: Okay, look. This isn't what we talked about.
43) 26) dialog: Can we just get our money back, please? Then we'll be on our way.
43) 39) dialog: Look, the whole reason we came to you is because we don't have the experience to do it ourselves.
43) 63) dialog: The Danny DeVito movie?
45) 3) dialog: We're outside. You ready for a little recon?
45) 7) dialog: What's the difference? He's not going to be your boss much longer.
47) 2) dialog: Okay, boys, as soon as Pellit makes a move, we tail him. It is on now.
48) 3) dialog: Ugghhhhh, I can't believe how much this sucks.
48) 18) dialog: (opening his door) Let's go check it out.
49) 8) dialog: We're not gonna get intel standing on his lawn. We have to go in.
49) 12) dialog: Here, do this.
49) 15) dialog: Here we go.
50) 2) dialog: Dale, keep an eye out. Let us know if Pellit's coming.
50) 11) dialog: Wow. This guy's a bigger douchebag than me.
50) 15) dialog: What kind of intel?
55) 6) dialog: Okay, my work upstairs is done. You guys ready to split?
56) 5) dialog: Not a complete waste.
56) 16) dialog: It's got his calendar and his contacts. This is what recon's all about.
56) 21) dialog: Shall we pay a little visit to your boss, Nick?
58) 9) dialog: Oh man, you should've asked me. I've got a whole box of those in my bedside table. (off their grossed-
58) 21) dialog: Very.
60) 13) dialog: Maybe something a little more subtle?
60) 25) dialog: Fine. Honk twice.
61) 7) dialog: Damn. Guess we'll have to break in the old-fashioned way.
61) 13) dialog: Holy shit. I broke the rock.
62) 5) dialog: For all we know, he's got a closet full of skin suits.
62) 10) dialog: Stupid cat.
64) 9) dialog: God damn it! How many cats do they have?
64) 13) dialog: Little bastard.
64) 16) dialog: Damn. That's Mrs. Harken? I'd like to cover her in cock yogurt.
64) 20) dialog: I did.
64) 23) dialog: Ahhh!
67) 5) dialog: 
67) 13) dialog: Holy shit! He's really doing it!
67) 22) dialog: He's not stopping. He's gonna get us all caught. We've gotta get out of here.
67) 26) dialog: He's a psychopath. We leave him behind.
69) 5) dialog: I can't go to jail. Look at these eyes. Look at this ass. They'll be all over me.
69) 9) dialog: 
69) 14) dialog: 
69) 24) dialog: I never said that --
69) 29) dialog: Yeah, Dale, we saw you.
69) 35) dialog: Not cool, man.
69) 46) dialog: Not cool, man.
69) 58) dialog: 
69) 66) dialog: I bet he doesn't wear it in the shower. We could put peanuts in his shampoo!
69) 72) dialog: Tomorrow night, I'll surveil her and figure out how to take her down.
69) 78) dialog: All right. That just leaves us with one final thing to settle.
69) 87) dialog: Dale, if Nick and I were in prison, which one of us would get raped more?
72) 7) dialog: Well, I've learned that Dale is a homosexual because this chick is unbelievably hot. How's it going over there?
86) 3) dialog: Okay, let's all stay calm and figure this out.
86) 7) dialog: A man you were going to kill anyway.
86) 11) dialog: What?
86) 22) dialog: I can't believe you guys! You can't just bail on a plan like that at the last minute.
86) 27) dialog: I don't know. I mean, afterwards, it was kind of hard to imagine killing her.
86) 41) dialog: I know, I know. But it's not my fault.
90) 4) dialog: I know. I'm a rapscallion.
90) 8) dialog: Hey. Not nice. And besides, I think I actually solved your problem, Dale. Julia just needed a good fucking. I bet she's not going to mess with you anymore.
90) 12) dialog: Here's what we do. We call the cops and make an anonymous tip that Harken killed Pellit. Boom. Harken's in jail. Pellit's in hell. Julia's had the crazy fucked out of her. Our problems are solved. Boom.
92) 16) dialog: Officer? This is not my car. Is it okay if I just -- ?
93) 10) dialog: Oh, please. We were just being hypothetical. You're the one who pushed us to do it.
93) 14) dialog: Why not?
93) 18) dialog: You know, I didn't actually do anything illegal, so...
93) 22) dialog: You gonna rat on me, Dale?
93) 28) dialog: Not if I rat on Dale first.
94) 23) dialog: 
94) 34) dialog: 
94) 40) dialog: I can't believe this.
94) 46) dialog: I was making love.
94) 51) dialog: (to the cops) Let me ask you something, Detective. Let's say one of us knew who the shooter was and was willing to hand you that perp on a platter. Would he be entitled to some sort of immunity for that information?
94) 57) dialog: Well, then I'm glad we have no idea who the shooter is, right, guys?
95) 15) dialog: We really showed those guys.
95) 19) dialog: For, like, a second.
96) 8) dialog: We are so fucked.
96) 14) dialog: Hey, that's right! I forgot all about Cocksucker. Why don't we ask him what to do?
97) 5) dialog: Not great. We need your help.
97) 22) dialog: What? No way. You said the last five thousand would cover this!
97) 40) dialog: A wire. That's good.
97) 57) dialog: You did. You said you served a `dime' for `some pretty ugly shit.'
97) 66) dialog: No.
97) 79) dialog: Hold on. You're telling me we've been taking murder advice from someone whose biggest crime was taping an Ethan Hawke movie?!
97) 95) dialog: Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.
101) 9) dialog: Okay, looks quiet. Is the tape recorder ready?
101) 16) dialog: I'll do it. I'm the only one without hair on my chest.
101) 20) dialog: I don't shave it. I wax it.
101) 27) dialog: Right. We'll sit there in the dark till he comes in, and then switch on a lamp. That'll freak him out.
101) 38) dialog: Why do you get to be the guy in the chair?
101) 44) dialog: That doesn't sound intimidating. That sounds like a musical number.
101) 48) dialog: So I'm just supposed to stand there like an idiot?
101) 52) dialog: Don't patronize me, Nick.
103) 29) dialog: (shaking her hand) Hi, we didn't formally meet. I'm Kurt.
103) 34) dialog: Nick didn't tell me that his boss was married to a model.
103) 39) dialog: 
103) 72) dialog: (still staring at Mrs. Harken) So fucking ready.
103) 79) dialog: 
104) 41) dialog: 
105) 6) dialog: Oh, hey.
105) 10) dialog: Uh, I had to go to the bathroom. Bad salmon puff. Are we ready to record Harken?
105) 16) dialog: Oh, man, I'm so sorry. I fucked up.
106) 3) dialog: Look, I wasn't thinking. She's so hot and I'm so weak. I'm a weak, weak man. I admit it.
106) 28) dialog: 
111) 2) dialog: Okay, it's clear that none of us can go home again. Probably ever.
111) 6) dialog: I'm sure they have cops at all our places. I think our best bet is to get out of the country.
111) 10) dialog: Mexico?
111) 14) dialog: You're right. What about Asia? We could become kick boxers.
111) 18) dialog: What if our entire lives have been leading up to this moment? What if we were destined from the very beginning to become Asian kick boxers?
111) 22) dialog: That seems like a lesser destiny.
112) 28) dialog: Oh, shit. We've got company.
112) 38) dialog: Lose him? Sure, Nick. His 500 horsepower is no match for my 150.
112) 78) dialog: Maybe I should've spit on her arms.
112) 83) dialog: What the hell?
112) 87) dialog: Yeah, thanks, Gregory, we know. We're being chased by a crazy man and he just smashed into us!
112) 104) dialog: I'm not! The engine died!
112) 108) dialog: Why would you do that, Gregory?!
112) 112) dialog: I pay nineteen bucks a month for this fucking service!
112) 121) dialog: Oh, shit!
113) 11) dialog: I'm guessing you don't want to
113) 44) dialog: That's crazy!
113) 55) dialog: 
113) 71) dialog: I told you.
113) 76) dialog: Probably.
113) 85) dialog: 
113) 91) dialog: Your wife gives great head.
116) 5) dialog: Thanks, Margie. I just wanted to congratulate you on taking over Bobby's job.
116) 9) dialog: Yeah. Tough month for the Pellit family. Anyway, if there's anything I can do to help out before the baby gets here, please let me know.
116) 14) dialog: Your baby.
116) 18) dialog: 
116) 30) dialog: I... oh, my God. I'm really sorry, Margie --
116) 36) dialog: How was I supposed to know you were just fat --
