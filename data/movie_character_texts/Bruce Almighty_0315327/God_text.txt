34) 1) text: Thank God you're alright. BRUCE
34) 2) text: God, yeah. Let's thank God. Thanks for everything, Lord. I am so honored that my horrible demise is a part of your loving and mysterious plan. GRACE
34) 4) text: Oh, don't worry, he's not listening. If he is he doesn't care. Have you seen the news lately? We got gangs, we got drugs, we got corruption. What kind of God lets that happen? Every time we cure a disease he comes up with a new one! (goes into God character) Yeah, is this the lab? Yeah, it's God. They've just come up with a treatment for syphilis down there. I think it's time to release the tainted monkey. Oh, and there's a guy in Ohio who's praying for strength and wisdom, blind him and cut off his legs. GRACE
34) 5) text: So God is torturing us? BRUCE
34) 6) text: Think about it, Grace. God is all- powerful . He could fix everything in five minutes if he wanted to. (MORE)
43) 38) text: I am so honored that my horrible demise is a part of your loving and mysterious plan.. The gloves are off, pal.. Smite me oh mighty smiter. (aside) I'm not much for blaspheming but that one made me laugh. Oh, and let's not forget "What kind of a God would let this happen? I mean, have you seen then news lately?" Bruce stands, dazed. В· BRUCE
43) 41) text: Sorry, it's not ringing a bell. JANITOR/GOD
43) 42) text: I'm God, Bruce. BRUCE
43) 43) text: Oh, you're God. Well that explains everything1 That's how you know everything about me. That's how you got up to the seventh floor so quickly. (placating) Well, it's really nice to meet you. Thanks for the Grand Canyon and, ah, good luck with the apocalypse. Bruce turns to leave, BUT FINDS HIMSELF WALKING RIGHT TOW GOD AND HIS DESK. He tries again, and again. BRUCE
43) 49) dialog: Three. He quickly pulls one finger in.
43) 50) dialog: Two. Bruce begins switching fingers rapidly.      God doesn't beat.
43) 51) dialog: Four. Nine. Six. Eight. One... One final attempt, Bruce holds seven fingers.
43) 53) dialog: Seven.
43) 57) text: You've been doing a lot of complaining about me, Bruce. And quite frankly, I'm tired of it... Bruce backs away from God. BRUCE
43) 58) text: You stay away from me! I don't know what your doing. But whatever you're doing is probably actionable! GOD
43) 60) text: Job? Wh at job? GOD
43) 62) text: Sure, whatever you say, Pal. He turns to go but GOD STANDS BEFORE HIM in the Janitor uniform, holding the mop. GOD
43) 63) text: All the power of God. Bruce glances back at the empty desk, turns back again an God the Janitor has also vanished. A beat, then Bruce sprints out of the room.
46) 1) text: Okay, just relax here. I did not meet God and I do not have his powers. (laughs) If that was God, then I'm Mario Andretti. Instantly, Bruce's car PEELS OUT, races through traffic, dodging and passing cars right and left. BRUCE
47) 17) text: Havin' fun? Bruce is startled and the soup splashes back to normal collapsing on the cockroach. He looks up at God standing beside the booth. Bruce is now awestruck. BRUCE
47) 18) text: You- He- Thy... GOD
48) 0) text: God leans down, lets the little soup covered cockroach go God and Bruce then walk along the lake shore. GOD
48) 4) text: Rules ? GOD
48) 6) text: Well the two extra fingers freaked me out a little bit. GOD
48) 7) text: (laughs) I figured that would get your attention.. I did the same thing to Ghandi, he couldn't eat for three weeks. Now, here's the deal. You have all my power. Use it any way you choose. There are only two rules. You can't tell anyone you're God. Believe me you don't want that kind of attention. And you can't mess with free will. BRUCE
48) 8) text: Uh huh.   Can I-ask why? GOD
48) 9) text: (excited) Yes you can. That's the beauty it. Suddenly a LARGE SAILBOAT SAIL PASSES RIGHT BY THEM.   Br looks to the sail, oddly, then... WIDE ANGLE - REVEAL God and Bruce are now walking ON THE about 100 feet from the shore. They watch the sailboat pa Bruce is awestruck. BRUCE
48) 10) text: This is amazing. GOD
48) 11) text: Oh, speaking of amazing... God dips his hand in the Lake and pulls out THE PRAYER BE He pockets them as he talks.
48) 14) text: God and Bruce are tiny figures on the river, as God begin walk away. GOD
48) 16) text: Where are you going? GOD
48) 18) text: God can't take a vacation. Can he? Can you? GOD
53) 3) text: What if God was one of us. . . Just a slob like one of us... Just a stranger on a bus... Trying to make his way. . . Grace reacts a bit surprised by Bruce's happy tone, she g up, opens the door and there stands BRUCE, beaming smile, holding a very unique BOUQUET OF FLOWERS. BRUCE
53) 5) text: (re: the flowers) Oh, my God. BRUCE
62) 0) text: Bruce heads for his severely beat-up junker car whistling "What if God were One of Us."
87) 0) text: He BURSTS out the kitchen exit into the alley. Unclasps h ears, but no relief. The whispers are now loud voices. We start to make out fragments of words "Please," "Help me," etc. Overwhelmed and scared, he slides down the alley wall, covering his face, then TOTAL SILENCE -- Bruce lowers his hands and finds himself SITTING ATOP A H MOUNTAIN PEAK. GOD (O.S.)
87) 1) text: Really something isn't it? God sits down next to Bruce. BRUCE
87) 2) text: Is this heaven? God laughs at this one. GOD
87) 7) text: Those voices... GOD
87) 8) text: They're prayers, Bruce. You keep ignoring them and they're going to build up on. you like that. You didn't think being God was going to be all fun and games did you? BRUCE
87) 9) text: Prayers? Those are prayers? Why can't I understand them? God forms a snowball in his hands as he talks. GOD
87) 11) text: Okay, so maybe I've righted a couple of the wrongs in my own life. I was going to get around to others. I can do both. I can help the world. GOD
87) 14) text: Bruce? What are you doing out here? With that, the terrain TRANSFORMS back into the alley whe Grace has been standing all along. She can not see .God.
87) 16) text: Oh, ah, (to God) She can't... (God shakes his head, back to Grace) I just, ah, needed a little fresh air. Bruce fakes a couple big breaths. GRACE
87) 17) text: Bruce, what is going on? The second I want to talk about us you run out on me. GOD
87) 20) text: You know, I actually had the crazy idea that you were going to ask me to marry you tonight. GOD
87) 22) text: (to God) You are not helping. (back to Grace) ...me at all here, Grace. GOD
87) 23) text: (sarcastic) Nice recovery. Bruce looks to God to shut up. GRACE
87) 28) dialog: She's got a point.
87) 34) dialog: You're going to have to answer those things, y'know.
87) 36) text: (to God) Thank you. GOD
87) 40) dialog: You wanted the job, Bruce.     I                        * suggest you get to it.                                  *
92) 1) text: (looks heavenward) Thank you, God.
93) 1) text: Thank you, God.

95) 1) text: I've got to find a better job...Come on light, turn...God, I wish I were thinner... BRUCE
100) 38) text: And what in God's name is going on with that dogI? Grace pulls her cell phone .out of her purse, heads for t door. GRACE
103) 4) text: Grace left me. GOD
103) 6) text: (certain) She'll take me back. (uncertain) Will she take me back? GOD
103) 8) text: How do you make someone love you when you can't effect free will? GOD
