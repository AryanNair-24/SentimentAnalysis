I am forced to employ the likes of  Mr. Cutless Supreme, whom I might  add, contributes significantly to my  overhead. I am the real loser here.  And I am concerned about your  sincerity in repaying the twenty- seven thousand, nine hundred forty- two dollar gambling debt that is one  week past due. What can you do to  reassure me of your good intentions?

The point of which is, I  already have a fuckin' miserable  life. So don't threaten me you lousy  bag of cat shit.
