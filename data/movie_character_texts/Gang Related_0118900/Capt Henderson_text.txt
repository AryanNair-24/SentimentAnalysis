13) 16) dialog: You got primary on the drug related  this morning on 27th.
13) 18) dialog: Who's your second? (Divinci points at  Rodriguez) In my office. Both of you.
13) 20) dialog: Now.
14) 1) dialog: Detectives Divinci and Rodriguez,  this is Richard Simms. He's with the  D.E.A. He wants to ask you some  questions about your case.
21) 2) dialog: It's been three days.
21) 4) dialog: When a Federal Undercover Officer  goes down, it's never a fuckin' murder  case! I don't like the DEA on my ass  any better than you like 'em on yours.  But this is personal for them and  they want answers. Forget your other  cases and get something, anything  that I can give to them. The last  thing I want is the goddamn F.B.I.  on my back, too.
21) 7) dialog: I can't hold 'em off much longer.
21) 9) dialog: Let me tell you both something, if  you don't solve this quick, they're  gonna start askin' why? And they'll  be lookin' to blame somebody in this  department. So my advise to you is,  get something fuckin' fast or turn  over what you've got and get outa  the way.
21) 12) dialog: A couple days. The funeral's this  afternoon.
21) 14) dialog: For Agent Hudd. Simms wants you there.
21) 16) dialog: How the hell do I know?! It's DEA,  it's their thing. You're the cops on  the case, I suppose they want you to  know what a great guy Hudd was so  you'll work all that harder to find  his killer. Just go. It'll reassure  'em how much you care and keep 'em  off my ass.
41) 14) dialog: I think they did a helluva job.
41) 24) dialog: Do me a favor. Make sure this one  sticks. I don't want the D.E.Assholes  back in here.
