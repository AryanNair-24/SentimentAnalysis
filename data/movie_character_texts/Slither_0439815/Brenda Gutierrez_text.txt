15) 16) dialog: Nope.   Brenda!
15) 21) dialog: I was! And I'll tell you somethin', Grant Grant. I's in love with you.
15) 24) dialog: My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?

43) 21) dialog: Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.

44) 7) text: Brenda looks at him, confused.
44) 13) dialog: What?
44) 16) text: Brenda, though startled, leans back on a boulder and star unbuttoning her blouse. After a moment, she looks at Grant, trying to be sexy while she does it. Grant looks at her in her bra.

44) 22) dialog: Grant!?    What -- ?!

44) 26) text: Brenda gets up, trying to run away. But Grant grabs her necklace, yanking her back. The necklace snaps and falls into the creek beside them.
44) 27) text: Grant pins Brenda's wrists against the rock.    She strug to get free.
44) 28) text: Brenda's eyes widen as she looks down to see the writhing tentacle-like tubule emerge from Grant's wound. She SCREAMS.
44) 30) text: The tubule comes to rest on her abdomen. Tears stream down from Brenda's eyes. It pushes into her flesh.
44) 31) text: Brenda goes into convulsions. Something -- a fluid -- pumps through the tubule and into Brenda.
44) 32) text: Grant watches Brenda without emotion as her body spasms there beside him.
55) 2) text: Grant peers over at Brenda, mostly in silhouette, sitting on the nest he has made. She's chained up and MOANS through a mouth gag. Grant walks to her. Her body is horribly pear-shaped and misshapen, like some tumorous pregnancy. Grant pulls her gag away.
55) 4) dialog: Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
55) 10) text: CLOSEUP: Brenda's face, still mostly in darkness. She stares at the meat, simultaneously excited and repulsed.
55) 15) dialog: Grant, I'm sorry if I did something wrong! I think I gotta -- I think I should go to a hospital!
55) 16) text: Grant doesn't respond.    Brenda's eyes trail back down t the meat.
55) 17) text: Brenda's hand reaches out, and grabs a maggot-infested pork chop, pulling it toward her.
55) 18) text: We HEAR, but can barely see, Brenda CHOWING DOWN on the raw pork in the nearly pitch black barn.
65) 1) text: We PAN OVER an altar where family members have placed little items that remind them of Brenda -- photographs, mementos, "Come home, Mommy" cards, etc.
65) 7) text: Brenda's husband, in the front pew, loses it, CRYING. His little children, beside him, fiddle in their seats.
88) 8) text: The posse gaze up at the old ramshackle barn where Grant had brought Brenda.
89) 4) text: It's Brenda. And she doesn't look good. Her weepy little head is stuck to the front of a huge fleshy orb, which is what her body has become. This enormous ball of flesh is nine or ten feet tall. Vestigial fingers protrude from the sides. She is utterly immobile. Her flesh sloshes, slightly and constantly; a thousand snakes seem to be slithering beneath her thin, tight, bruised skin. The woman is in great pain. She SOBS. Her mouth and chin are stained with blood.
89) 11) text: Brenda is encircled by the rotting carcasses of cows and horses and forest critters. They are mostly skeletal, as they have been largely devoured. They're swarming with flies. The stench is so bad the posse cover their faces with the bottom of their shirts.
89) 12) text: The SOBBING Brenda looks desperately at Bill and Wally.
89) 14) dialog: Something's wrong with me.
89) 21) dialog: I didn't want no one to be seeing me like this.
89) 22) text: As the posse inch closer, Brenda's whole body suddenly LURCHES FORWARD a bit -- like whatever's inside her is trying to get out and to the posse. Brenda SCREAMS in agony.
89) 25) dialog: How are my boys, Bill?    Are they all right?
89) 29) dialog: I'm so fucking hungry, Bill. I'm so hungry. I just never knew anybody could be so hungry.
89) 30) text: Brenda tries to smile in a way she might charm her Daddy into giving her candy. This is creepy as hell.
89) 32) dialog: Would you mind handing me a piece of that possum there at your feet? Little bit?
91) 1) text: Bill eyes poor Brenda.
91) 6) text: Again, Brenda SCREAMS.    Her body LURCHES FORWARD.
91) 14) dialog: It hurts!
91) 17) dialog: Help me!!     Help!!
91) 18) text: And then AGAIN. Starla notices that Brenda's skin is starting to SPLIT AND TEAR on her side.
91) 22) dialog: Little fuckers are tearing me aparrrr- !
91) 23) text: Brenda SCREAMS like a woman giving a thousand evil births at once and her body RIPS OPEN in one part; and then, in quick succession, ANOTHER, and ANOTHER. Bill looks out one of the windows. Grant is peering in at them, smiling.
91) 26) text: And then Brenda's body BURSTS OPEN COMPLETELY, like a water balloon hitting cement, and thousands of little SLITHERING EYELESS PARASITES with slippery black-red skin like slugs spill forth. The horrid creatures, eight inche long and a few inches thick, swarm over the posse, completely covering them before they can react.
95) 1) text: Bill is trying to make sense of it all. He gazes down at Brenda's body, her bloody skin and misshapen skeleton spread out over the floor, split open like an enormous bloody tiger rug.
104) 45) text: -- We sit over a convulsing Brenda, impregnating her with our tubule.
141) 9) text: NO LONGER PRETTY                BRENDA'S HUSBAND
141) 28) text: DISEASED MAN                     BRENDA'S HUSBAND
