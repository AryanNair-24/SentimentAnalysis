99) 2) text: There's a KNOCK on the bathroom door. Kylie turns toward the door -- as she does, a parasite crawls across the window behind her, streaking a moist slimy trail.

104) 10) text: Kylie snatches the very end of the parasite's tail. Her long, teddy-bear-spotted fingernails pinch it there, digging into the parasite's flesh, barely stopping it from sliding completely into her mouth. It wildly flaps its tail like a docked trout, desperate to enter her.

104) 52) text: Kylie spots her curling iron on the counter; it's plugged in, the red light is on. She grabs it, and swings it into the wormy thing.

108) 4) text: More parasites are crawling towards Kylie through the grass.
108) 7) text: The things approach, crawling in after her. Kylie tries to slam the door shut, but it won't; many things are stuc in the door jamb.

115) 39) text: Bill and Kylie dash toward the cluster of cars as the diseased chase them.

125) 100) text: Kylie nods.
125) 102) dialog: He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before - amoeba-things, and rhino-things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.

125) 111) text: Kylie shrugs.   The police car starts CHUGGING.

128) 32) text: Kylie, underneath the rock overhang, watches Bill try to scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun. It's just a little too far away. She works up her nerve and slowly starts to crawl out toward him.
128) 35) text: Bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle. It's too far away. But then he sees Kylie, at the butt of the rifle. She reaches out and pushes it just a little, into Bill's hand. Bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat, and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him, knocking the beast back.
128) 40) text: Kylie looks around to see more diseased deer running through the fields toward them.
130) 7) text: Kylie turns her head, and glances out the window.   And SCREAMS. Starla, Bill, and Trevor turn to see --
