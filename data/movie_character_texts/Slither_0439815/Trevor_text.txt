140) 18) text: And the whole door and part of the wall bursts open. The Diseased pour inside and around Trevor, GLEEKING all over him, splattering his body with the burning liquid. Trevor starts to puff up, swelling, becoming soft. They grab him.
140) 21) text: Bill grabs Trevor by the wrist, and tries to pull him away from them. But Trevor SCREAMS in agony; the liquid has made his flesh too soft. His entire body splits apart like wet tissue, his organs spilling out in front of them
