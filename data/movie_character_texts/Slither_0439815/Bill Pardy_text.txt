7) 12) dialog: Your uncle Barry left her for a stripper up in Winnsboro.
9) 1) text: Bill, Wally, Trevor, Margaret, and the Waitress enter. The doe skips around.
9) 5) dialog: Right.
9) 8) text: Bill spots the open rear door, and tries to herd the deer toward it.
9) 10) dialog: Come on now, honey, door's this way.
9) 14) dialog: She's just scared, Margaret.
9) 21) dialog: She ain't a bull, Trevor!
9) 28) dialog: Get back.
9) 29) text: The other cops step away.   Bill steps slowly toward the doe, speaking calmly.
9) 31) dialog: It's okay, sweetheart.   Nobody's gonna hurt you.
9) 32) text: The doe looks at him, settling a bit.   His voice seems t be soothing her. Bill gets closer.
9) 34) dialog: That's right. Just gonna pull this cord out. It's gonna be all right.
9) 35) text: The cops and restaurant folk look on in awe as the doe, breathing heavily, becomes still. Bill scoops close past her, and yanks the telephone cord out of the wall.
9) 36) text: Bill smiles. Then the doe runs forward, almost knocking Bill over, and streaks out the back door.
9) 37) text: Bill, Wally, Margaret, and Trevor move up to the doorway and watch the deer skitter off into the woods beyond, dragging the telephone, tied to her leg.
9) 39) dialog: Hell, she took a phone. Now them forest critters are gonna be calling us all hours of the night.
40) 9) text: Bill, Trevor and Margaret are hanging out on a large rock outside the entranceway, drinking beer. Bill watches Grant and Starla cross the lot. Trevor sees this.
40) 13) dialog: That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
40) 19) dialog: Hell, you don't know that, Margaret.
40) 29) dialog: You're right, Jack.    Margaret, you're fired.
45) 1) text: Starla is leaning over a wooden rail, looking at the ligh of the town below. She turns to see Bill lean on the rail beside her. She looks genuinely happy.
45) 6) dialog: Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
45) 10) dialog: Sorry.
45) 14) dialog: Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
45) 17) dialog: What you up to?
45) 20) text: Bill and Starla look out over the city together.
45) 22) dialog: Pretty, ain't they?
45) 26) dialog: Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
45) 31) dialog: There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
45) 35) dialog: Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
45) 38) text: Starla LAUGHS out loud.   So does Bill.
45) 40) dialog: Oh, will you now?
45) 47) dialog: Hey, Grant.
45) 48) text: Grant eyes Bill with suspicion.    He grabs Starla.
45) 51) text: Starla nods.   She looks at Bill and mouths:
45) 54) text: Bill watches Grant and Starla head off, as he downs the rest of his beer. Wally walks up beside him.
45) 60) dialog: Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
45) 61) text: Bill SNAPS his fingers, trying to remember.
45) 65) dialog: Oh yeah.     Fuck you, fat ass.
57) 1) text: There's a HARD KNOCKING on Starla's door. She swings it open to see Bill and Wally standing there, worried.
57) 11) text: Bill and Wally exchange a glance -- maybe this means something. Starla can see Trevor and Margaret, across the street, talking to another neighbor.
57) 13) dialog: Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez?
57) 16) dialog: Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
57) 22) dialog: She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
57) 26) dialog: The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
57) 29) dialog: The Deer Cheer. And Wally and me, we also saw him that night, with mud all over his slacks.
57) 30) text: Bill hands her his card.
57) 32) dialog: Have him call me right away, okay?
57) 33) text: Starla nods, distraught. Bill tries to smile kindly befor he and Wally move out and off to canvas other neighbors' homes.
60) 2) text: She turns from the window and picks up a cordless phone. She looks at the card Bill gave her, and dials the number The phone RINGS, and:
63) 28) dialog: Starla?!!   Starla, are you in there?!
63) 31) dialog: Starla?!
63) 32) text: Starla, with barely an ounce of life left in her, sees Bill, Wally, Trevor and Margaret burst into the living room.
63) 43) text: Bill Pardy runs toward the back door.
64) 1) text: Bill runs out into the backyard. Wally runs up behind him. They look around at the trees surrounding the area. Grant is nowhere to be seen.
65) 10) text: Bill Pardy is here, in full uniform, hat in hands.
65) 11) text: BILL                               CONGREGATION
65) 13) text: Bill looks around the church. He spots Starla, in the very back of church, head down, distraught, guilty.
66) 3) dialog: Starla.
66) 4) text: Starla turns to see Bill coming after her.   She stops.
66) 6) dialog: I talked to the CDC. They didn't have nothin' on file consistent with Grant's... symptoms.
66) 11) dialog: New? No. We're hoping we find Grant, he'll lead us to her.
66) 14) dialog: You all right?
66) 19) text: Bill watches her go.
67) 1) text: Bill enters. A few COPS and SECRETARIES are bustling, making phone calls, etc. They all look tired, as if they haven't slept. Jack, the mayor, sees Bill.
67) 4) text: Bill spots him, moving quickly toward him.
67) 6) dialog: Shit.
67) 12) dialog: 'Mornin', Jack.
67) 13) text: Bill crosses the station.   Jack follows.
67) 17) dialog: Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
67) 22) dialog: Don't worry, we'll find him. (to Trevor) Anything new?
67) 27) dialog: Dude's a half-squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
67) 32) dialog: Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
67) 44) dialog: What?
67) 48) dialog: And that makes you look like a squid?
67) 51) text: Bill, Wally, and Trevor can't help but SNICKER.
67) 56) text: Bill looks over at Shelby, on his headset at the dispatch unit.
67) 59) text: Bill nods for Trevor and Margaret to get up from their desks. They do, and start to move out with Bill and Wally
68) 6) text: Bill and Wally are staring at the dog from above.
68) 8) dialog: Rorschach.
68) 11) text: Bill moves on through the windswept weeds.
68) 13) dialog: I see we're fucked.   Three ranches in three days.
68) 14) text: Margaret is taking measurements and writing in a note pad; she sees Bill.
68) 17) text: Bill nods.
68) 20) text: Bill nods.
68) 28) text: Bill looks over at Trevor, standing up between the tall weeds, holding a dog's head in his hand.
68) 35) text: Bill peers at the various slaughtered dogs around them.
68) 38) text: Trevor heads toward them. Bill looks off into the dark forest on the edge of the ranch.
68) 40) dialog: He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
68) 45) text: Bill has a realization.   He moves quickly for his car.
68) 47) dialog: Wally, come on. Trevor and Margaret, get some folks together. I think I know where he's gonna hit next.
69) 3) dialog: So the night after Grant ran off, a calf went missing from here, the Raglans' ranch.
69) 4) text: REVEAL Bill, standing beside the bulletin board. A posse has gathered, listening intently: Wally and the usual cops; Jack; an OLDER COP, probably pulled out of retirement; and a couple of recruits -- a REDNECK and a GOOD OL' BOY. Bill points to the next red circle.
69) 6) dialog: Two nights ago, a mare was stolen from this property, run by Fitzgibbon, that old rancher with the cleft palate.
69) 13) dialog: Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
69) 14) text: Bill points to the next circle.
69) 16) dialog: And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit-storm took place.
69) 19) text: Bill nods and points to the next red circle.
69) 21) dialog: And if he sticks to that pattern he'll be here next. Belongs to a family, the Strutemyers'. Now I know y'all are tired and you've barely seen your families. But we're gonna have to go there tonight, lie low and wait.
69) 26) dialog: Just remember, we don't know what we're up against here. So let's be careful.
70) 1) text: Beside a small armory, Trevor loads a Benelli M-1 super semiautomatic shotgun. Margaret checks the site on a Remington 700 PSS rifle. Bill takes a Springfield M-1A pump-action for himself, while Wally stuffs numerous pistols and ammo into a leather satchel. Trevor notices a dusty grenade on a shelf.
70) 6) text: Bill looks at Trevor, considering.
70) 8) dialog: Can't hurt.
70) 9) text: As Trevor puts the grenade into a side-pocket on the satchel, Bill sees Jack and the Older Cop, watching.
71) 2) text: Bill and Wally walk out to their police car.   Bill tosse the leather satchel into the trunk.
71) 3) text: They get in the car, Bill starts the engine, when --
71) 4) text: Starla Grant pulls quickly into the parking lot. Bill rolls down the window as she gets out of her car and runs toward them.
71) 8) dialog: Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
71) 9) text: Bill starts to roll away, but Starla holds on to the car, following.
71) 13) dialog: He tried to kill you, Starla.
71) 22) dialog: Starla, it ain't --
71) 25) text: Bill looks at her.   He looks at Wally.     Wally shrugs.
71) 26) text: Bill nods for Starla to get in.
73) 4) text: The Redneck and Good Ol' Boy make their way to the ranch as well. They see Bill with Starla.
76) 1) text: Inside the barn, the wind is only slightly quieter, and it's darker. Bill, Starla, and Wally are here. Bill peers out through the doorway at cattle drinking from the trough. He looks at Starla; her head tilts to the side as she nods off. When her head falls all the way, she snaps back up, and catches Bill gazing at her.
76) 2) text: Bill nods and smiles. She doesn't smile back; she's embarrassed and miserable and this is the last place she wants to be.
76) 5) dialog: Hey, Starla, remember that time when you were a kid and you came knocking on my window in the middle of the night?
76) 8) dialog: Starla here's twelve. Guess I was fourteen. I said, 'Starla, what the hell you doing out there?' She tells me she's running away to Hollywood to become a big star. She said she knew I was in ROTC, and she was gonna need a bodyguard. Invited me along.
76) 9) text: Wally LAUGHS. Bill smiles. Starla is embarrassed, but grudgingly enjoys the story.
76) 11) dialog: I said, 'Starla, if there's anybody can take care of herself, I think it's you. I'm gonna have to decline.'
76) 23) dialog: Yeah, maybe I did.
78) 1) text: Bill, Starla, and Wally see Grant Grant emerging from the forest. He has transformed into something much more monstrous: a giant, gangrenous, slug-like beast, a clump of cells and tumor-like protuberances. He has various tentacle-like-arms growing out of him, like overgrown eyes on a potato. As opposed to just having the disease, he now seems to BE the disease itself.
80) 1) text: Bill and Wally stare out the window, motionless.
80) 6) dialog: Starla, where you...?
82) 1) text: Bill motions through the barn window to Margaret.
83) 7) text: Starla moves even closer.   Bill and Wally are coming in close behind her.
83) 23) text: Grant SCREECHES again: a warning. He looks from Starla to Bill, with hurt, jealous eyes, and GROWLS.
83) 25) text: While Bill tries to decide what to do, the Good Ol' Boy nervously blocks Grant's path. He aims his pistol at him.
83) 32) dialog: Fire!   Fire!
83) 35) text: Bill and the other posse members take off after him like hounds on the heel of their prey. They SHOOT madly.
87) 12) text: Bill sees Starla run up behind them.    He waves her back
87) 14) dialog: Starla, get the hell out of here!
87) 17) text: Bill and Wally are searching in front of the boulder. Margaret SEES, but they don't, Grant pulling himself up on a tree branch and RISING behind them. Blood from a shotgun wound is dripping into the creek. Grant, pissed, lifts a tentacle.
87) 20) text: Bill turns as the tentacle swings down toward him. He falls back; the tentacle slashes inches from his face.
87) 21) text: Bill BLASTS his shotgun up at Grant, but Grant is already slithering swiftly back into the thick brush.
88) 11) text: Margaret looks at Bill.
88) 14) text: Bill takes the lead, carefully approaching the barn.
88) 15) text: The posse follows, their weapons drawn. The closer they get to the barn, the more unbearable the smell becomes. Only Bill, intent on the task in front of him, doesn't react to the stench at all.
88) 16) text: Bill leans his ear in close to the front door, and listen Through the door he can HEAR a QUIET SOBBING. Bill and Wally exchange a look.
88) 17) text: Bill steps back. He and Wally aim their shotguns at the door. Bill nods to Margaret, and gestures for her to open it. Starla watches all this from the rear.
89) 1) text: Bill and Wally move cautiously but quickly inside.   But they stop suddenly, in disgust and horror.
89) 3) dialog: Oh...
89) 5) text: The posse and Starla enter behind Bill and Wally and are equally astounded.
89) 12) text: The SOBBING Brenda looks desperately at Bill and Wally.
89) 17) text: Bill and Wally get in a little closer.
89) 19) dialog: Brenda, um...
89) 27) dialog: Boys are fine, Brenda. Uh, what's -- what's happening here, exactly?
91) 1) text: Bill eyes poor Brenda.
91) 3) dialog: I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
91) 23) text: Brenda SCREAMS like a woman giving a thousand evil births at once and her body RIPS OPEN in one part; and then, in quick succession, ANOTHER, and ANOTHER. Bill looks out one of the windows. Grant is peering in at them, smiling.
91) 25) dialog: He led us here.
93) 3) text: Bill notices the parasites slithering into the mouths of the Redneck and the Older Cop as well; whites of their eyes, bodies convulsing, spewing blood. Bill sees the things oozing up Margaret's neck.
93) 5) dialog: Margaret, cover your mouth!
93) 6) text: Bill sees Trevor outside the door in the dirt, trying to slap the parasites off. Bill yells to everyone:
93) 8) dialog: Don't let 'em in your mouths!
93) 9) text: One starts to get in Bill's mouth as he speaks, but he slaps it aside. Margaret pulls her shirt over her face.
93) 12) text: Bill is holding the knife in one hand, his other hand firmly over his mouth. Bill swats more incoming parasites away from Starla's mouth. He covers her mouth with his free hand. He lies on top of her, mushing their bodies and faces as closely together as possible so the things don't get into them. The parasites swarm all over them, flapping their slimy little tails as they try to fight their way inside their mouths. But Bill holds tight to himself and Starla.
93) 15) text: Eventually, the parasites give up on Bill and Starla, and begin to slither away. Bill watches as they crawl off the posse and filter out of the barn in a squirmy mound.
93) 16) text: Eventually, they're gone. Bill takes his hand from Starla's mouth. Starla looks around.
95) 1) text: Bill is trying to make sense of it all. He gazes down at Brenda's body, her bloody skin and misshapen skeleton spread out over the floor, split open like an enormous bloody tiger rug.
110) 2) text: Bill, suppressing his desperation, is trying to make contact on his police radio.
110) 4) dialog: 11-41. We're gonna need paramedics out here right away. We got four men down.
110) 5) text: Bill listens for a response, but there's only STATIC. presses the button again.
110) 7) dialog: Shelby, you there?
110) 8) text: Still, only STATIC.    Bill tries another frequency.
110) 10) dialog: Shelby, this is Bill.     We got an emergency here.
110) 14) dialog: Goddammit.
110) 15) text: Bill steps outside the doorway, to see if he can get reception. Trailing off:
110) 17) dialog: Shelby?
110) 34) text: Bill re-enters.
110) 36) dialog: No reception out here.
110) 44) dialog: No. I'll go. The three of you, you wait here. Get these folks, out of the barn. The stench and rot can't be any good for 'em.
110) 45) text: Margaret and Trevor nod.    As Bill starts to leave, Star grabs him.
110) 50) text: Bill nods. Makes a feeble attempt at a smile.   He jogs off into the forest.
111) 1) text: Bill runs into the small glade, and looks around, trying to remember which way he came from.
111) 2) text: He gazes between some greenery, some distance away, and spies a long-lashed deer munching on foliage. A couple more deer and a fawn are eating as well. Bill looks at them a moment, peaceful, perhaps a sign of some hope...
111) 4) text: Bill runs away as fast as he can.
114) 1) text: Bill, out of breath, runs out of the forest --
115) 1) text: Bill emerges on the edge of the ranch, stretching five or six acres out in front of him. On the other side of the field is the gravel road, where his police car is parked. Beside the field is the Strutemyer's farmhouse.
115) 2) text: Bill HEARS a CRASH. He turns to see the diseased Strutemyers in their driveway, all holding rocks now, smashing the pickup's windows.
115) 4) dialog: Hey!
115) 6) text: Kylie sees Bill through the rear windshield.    She unloc the door, and jumps out of the car.
115) 8) dialog: What's -- ?
115) 9) text: Kylie runs past her family and up to Bill.    She grabs onto him, and hides behind him, WEEPING.
115) 11) dialog: What's going on here?
115) 16) dialog: What happened to you, Dwight?
115) 28) dialog: Okay. Y'all just wait in this spot. I'm gonna call the paramedics for you. Kylie can come with --
115) 31) text: Bill turns to see the RANCHER with the cleft palate, now diseased, holding a shovel. He swings it into Bill, knocking him down.
115) 33) text: The Cleft Palate Rancher stands over Bill and raises the shovel to bring it down again.
115) 34) text: Bill feels for his shotgun, which has fallen into the dirt beside him. He yanks the trigger.
115) 36) text: Bill stands, pulling Kylie with him as the other diseased folks rush toward them through the fields.
115) 38) dialog: Come on.
115) 39) text: Bill and Kylie dash toward the cluster of cars as the diseased chase them.
118) 1) text: Bill and Kylie arrive at his police car. Bill throws the door open, and shoves Kylie inside. As he starts to get in, he turns to see the two little girls closing in.
118) 2) text: One opens her mouth and GLEEKS -- it shoots out and lands on the car right beside Bill's hand.
118) 3) text: The other little girl opens her mouth to GLEEK as Bill jumps into the driver's seat. He slams the door shut just as the oozy liquid splashes on the window beside him.
118) 4) text: Bill is grossed-out by this, but he doesn't have much time. He goes to reload his shotgun, when he remembers.
118) 6) dialog: Shit.   Ammo's in the trunk.
118) 9) dialog: Trevor!   Margaret!
120) 3) dialog: (into radio) Where are you?!
120) 8) text: Bill JAMS the car forward, knocking the sisters off the hood. Then he slams on the brakes.
120) 13) text: But, instead, of pulling forward on the gravel road, Bill turns up and onto the ranch itself -- back towards the running diseased.
120) 15) dialog: My friends are still in the forest.
120) 16) text: Bill speeds the police car over the dirt field, trying to avoid approaching ranchers. Some leap at the car, holding on and getting tossed aside. Bill zooms back toward the trees.
120) 17) text: Just as Bill gets a little headway on the diseased, the car gets stuck in some mud. The wheels spin, spraying mud, as the infected approach.
122) 1) text: The infected arrive at the car. Bill just lets his foot off the gas, and sits there, letting the ranchers leap onto the car. Kylie looks at Bill, panicked by his choice to do nothing.
122) 3) dialog: We need their weight.
122) 4) text: Bill slams down the gas again, and the car zooms forward. The diseased get knocked off.
122) 6) dialog: Dumbshits.
122) 7) text: Bill rushes toward the trees of the forest.
123) 3) text: Bill's police car, cruising over the forest floor, direct toward him. Jack, frightened, lets go of Starla. He's about to get hit when --
123) 5) text: Jack smiles, and moves toward Bill -- but Starla rises behind him, holding a sharp rusty stake from the barbed- wire fence.
123) 8) text: Bill backs the car out from between the trees. He sees the Older Cop and Redneck coming in toward them.
123) 10) dialog: Come on!
124) 2) text: Bill looks to his side; he's down a bit from the Strutemyers' ranch. He pulls away, heading back toward town.
124) 3) text: The foursome sit in a stupefied daze. Starla's beside Bill. Trevor and Kylie are in the back. Bill grabs the police radio.
124) 5) dialog: Shelby?
124) 8) text: Nothing. STATIC.   Everyone notes this, worried.    Bill tries again:
124) 10) dialog: Shelby, you there?
124) 14) text: Bill and Starla look at each other, relieved.
125) 8) dialog: Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
125) 12) dialog: Shelby --
125) 16) dialog: Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
125) 19) dialog: Are you nodding?
125) 25) dialog: I can't hear when you're nodding.
125) 29) dialog: We'll be there in ten minutes.
125) 30) text: Bill hangs up. Kylie is clutching onto herself, hollow- eyed, in deep shock. She mutters, almost unintelligibly:
125) 33) text: Starla, Bill, and Trevor look at her.
125) 44) text: Bill stares at Kylie like she's insane.
125) 56) dialog: Kylie, honey.    Please.
125) 61) dialog: A lot of bad things have happened to you today, we know. But we need your help to find out what's going on.
125) 66) dialog: The worm?
125) 74) dialog: Who? (pause) Who?
125) 86) dialog: A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
125) 110) dialog: (to Kylie) So the way to stop this thing is to stop Grant?
125) 113) dialog: Shit.
126) 1) text: Bill, Starla, Kylie, and Trevor step slowly out of the car. They look around the deserted road.
126) 5) text: Bill speaks into the radio again, as he gets his leather satchel of weaponry out of the trunk. Trevor grabs ammo from the satchel to reload his pistol.
126) 7) dialog: Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
126) 11) dialog: Do it.
126) 15) text: The foursome walks down the road, toward the city.   Star and Bill are in the lead.
126) 17) dialog: Hey, Starla.
126) 20) dialog: Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
126) 23) text: Bill nods.
126) 27) dialog: Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
126) 33) text: Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
126) 35) dialog: When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
126) 39) dialog: I'm sorry.
126) 46) text: Bill nods.    Starla looks at him, smiles.
126) 52) dialog: Hell, Starla.    I always regretted that.
128) 4) text: They look at each other. Bill takes his flashlight off his belt and aims it in front of him. They all slowly approach the car, in the darkness.
128) 5) text: Bill aims his flashlight into the Buick.   The keys are still there, but no one's inside.
128) 9) text: Bill and the others look around.
128) 12) text: Bill hears a LAPPING sound behind him.   He turns, aiming the flashlight downward.
128) 14) text: The diseased deer glances up at Bill and GROWLS a low growl.
128) 16) dialog: Fuck me.
128) 17) text: The deer springs upward, bringing his hoofs into Bill's chest. Bill is knocked violently to the gravel, dropping his shotgun and satchel. The deer rears back and brings his hoofs down into Bill again. They CRACK Bill's head against the hard road.
128) 25) text: A TUMOROUS DOE leaps onto Bill, biting into his shoulder and tearing at his flesh, so now he has two deer on him. Bill is bleeding, dizzy, and disoriented, but he's able to turn, just a bit, to see the barrel of his shotgun above him. He tries to scoot himself back as he's being battered. He reaches up for the shotgun; but the tips of his fingers barely graze the muzzle.
128) 32) text: Kylie, underneath the rock overhang, watches Bill try to scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun. It's just a little too far away. She works up her nerve and slowly starts to crawl out toward him.
128) 35) text: Bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle. It's too far away. But then he sees Kylie, at the butt of the rifle. She reaches out and pushes it just a little, into Bill's hand. Bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat, and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him, knocking the beast back.
128) 37) text: Bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands. He stuffs the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg. The deer looks at him. Blood is running down Bill's face and he looks half-crazed. Bill glances down and sees the telephone wire wrapped around her ankle.
128) 38) text: Bill pulls the trigger, destroying her.
128) 39) text: He stands, looking around for the deer with Trevor. It has dragged him a fair distance down the street. Bill SHOOTS once, missing it, and again, hitting it straight on.

134) 5) text: Bill grabs hammers and nails off a hardware bench.
134) 13) text: Bill and Starla see slithering parasites coming in from other cracks in the room as well. They also BLAST at them. Dust is all around; they can hardly see.
134) 14) text: Bill runs out of ammo. He grabs a hand-held Black and Decker electric circular saw and turns it on. He starts jamming it into the parasites, cutting them up, and putti big slices in the floor. They SQUEAK with pain.

140) 22) text: Bill stares down in shock, still holding Trevor's arm.
141) 1) text: Bill follows her. Two DISEASED PEOPLE appear, SCREECHING and running toward them. Bill SHOOTS them both. And he makes a break for it, running as fast as he can across the street.
141) 2) text: He turns, expecting to see Starla right behind him. But she has stayed behind, staring quietly at the ground. Starla has tears in her eyes. She motions with her head for Bill to go. Bill is confused.
141) 3) text: The diseased townsfolk come up around Starla from the sides of the flower store, no one paying attention to Bill. They encircle her, slowly. Some SCREECH angrily at her. She's too disgusted or fearful to even look in their eyes. They BREATHE with SICK, RASPY breath.

179) 6) dialog: Hey.
180) 1) text: Bill and Starla hobble down the town center. The leather bag is slung over Bill's shoulder. Everything around them is dead: the victims who were being feasted on, as well as the various diseased. The torture is over, but no life remains.
