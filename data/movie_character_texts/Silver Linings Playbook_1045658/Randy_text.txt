18) 3) dialog: Come on, tell me that one. PAT SR. It's insanity. He spikes the ball at the one yard line. The one- fucking-yard line. I mean, get into the end zone, dummy. I mean, he celebrates before he's even in!
18) 4) dialog: You know something? It's nothing new. Your team does that all the time. They get close...
18) 9) dialog: ...and then they blow it. They got an inferiority complex.
18) 14) dialog: Because we are, we're America's Team. PAT SR. You should be ashamed of yourself. We're in Philadelphia, what's the matter with you? You're a fucking traitor.
18) 15) dialog: What's more American than a cowboy? PAT SR. You know what's more American?
18) 16) dialog: What? PAT SR. Benjamin Franklin, that's what's more American.

19) 5) dialog: If he wasn't on the hundred dollar bill, nobody...
19) 8) dialog: ...would even know who he is. FALLEN FRAMED PHOTO OF PAT, ON THE TABLE BELOW. PAT SR. What are you doing? No, no, no, no. Don't touch them, don't touch them.
19) 9) dialog: I didn't even touch `em. Why are you--, don't blame me. PAT SR. Who did this? Who took, who took, who took the...
20) 4) dialog: No, I don't touch them. As a matter of fact, I don't know why you need so many. Hey, there she is! Look how beautiful! PAT SR. (turns, sees Pat) What?! What's this?!
20) 5) dialog: Hey. PAT SR. STEPS CLOSER, PATTING PAT ON THE ARM. PAT SR. Everything good? 11.
107) 3) dialog: I'll bet I know what happened if only one is missing. Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope and one of `em took it. That's the only answer. PAT SR. No, no, no. DOLORES, PREPARING FOOD IN THE KITCHEN.
107) 10) dialog:

128) 3) dialog: He's betting everything on the Giant game. Everything. 110.
128) 5) dialog: All the money that he needs for the restaurant, he's betting on the Giant game. PAT SR. Tell him why.
128) 6) dialog: Because he believes in you.
128) 16) dialog: Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet. As a matter of fact, I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game. PAT SR. Randy. (to Pat) I just hope you heard what I said. It's like a family business, it's our family endeavor. We all stick together on this. That's how it works. That's a positive, positive vibe.
133) 67) dialog: Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know? You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil.
133) 71) dialog: That's bullshit! That's not true! Don't say that!
133) 73) dialog: How do you want me to prove it? PAT SR. How's he gonna prove it?
133) 76) dialog: Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week? Is that what you're saying?
133) 83) dialog: When is the game?
133) 89) dialog: Yeah, I believe in America's Team but if I win that bet, I win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing. PAT SR. I like it.
133) 104) dialog: Dolores, would you stop him?
133) 107) dialog: You're crazy to give away that many points. That's ridiculous! I won't take that! However, wait a second. I do like the idea of a parlay.
133) 110) dialog: Pat, how do they run this dance competition? I mean, how do they score it and everything?
133) 114) dialog: Okay, score is from one to ten, right? And you guys are how good?

133) 119) dialog: They're good? Better than you? Pause. Tiffany says nothing.
133) 121) dialog: A lot better. So if I was to say you only have to score five, I would be really very generous, right?

133) 133) dialog: Shake on it.
145) 14) dialog: 
151) 50) dialog:
