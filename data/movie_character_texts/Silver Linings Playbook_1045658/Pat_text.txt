46) 3) dialog: Yeah, about a week before the incident, I called the cops and I told them that my wife and the history guy were plotting against me by embezzling money from the local high school, which wasn't true. It was a delusion. And we later found out from the hospital that's because I'm, uh...
46) 5) dialog: Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God. And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life. And without any supervision I've been doing it all on my own with no help and basically I've been white-knuckling it this whole time. 23.

58) 5) dialog: Let me say something, I gotta say something.
58) 7) dialog: This is what I believe to be true. This is what I learned in the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining.
58) 9) dialog: Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this party on Sunday night and it's like a real hoity-toity thing and his wife, Veronica's a real stickler for.... I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles.

63) 12) dialog: Where would the dead body...where would the body go, though? `Cause the outside of the-- 43.
64) 3) dialog: Well, I don't have an iPod. I don't even have a phone. They won't let me make any calls. They think I'm gonna call Nikki.
64) 5) dialog: I would call Nikki.
64) 14) dialog: Can you play "Ride the Lightning" by Metallica? VERONICA IS SPEECHLESS. RONNIE GRINS.
65) 2) dialog: Here's a fun fact. You know where the term "OK" comes from?
65) 5) dialog: Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth president of the United States of America, is from Kinderhook, New York...
65) 7) dialog: ...and he was part of a club, a men's club, called Old Kinderhook. And if you were cool, you were in the club, they'd say, "That guy's OK." `Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.
65) 9) dialog: Yeah. Pretty cool, right?
65) 13) dialog: Oh, really? My wife loves dance. Nikki loves dance.
65) 20) dialog: Wow, wow, wow. Fascinating.
65) 25) dialog: Me? None. I used to be on Lithium and Seroquel and Abilify, but I don't take them anymore, no. They make me foggy and they also make me bloated.
65) 28) dialog: You ever take Klonopin?
65) 30) dialog: Right?
65) 32) dialog: It's like, "What? What day is it?" How about Trazodone?
65) 35) dialog: Oh, it flattens you out. I mean, you are done. It takes the light right out of your eyes.
65) 41) dialog: You mean me?

66) 4) dialog: How what works?
66) 7) dialog: How old are you?

73) 4) dialog: (shouts O.S.) Dad, not now!

76) 3) dialog: He's got all his Eagles videos and not one video of my wedding! PAT SEARCHES THROUGH THE VIDEOTAPES.
76) 4) dialog: Is it here? I mean....? PAT SR. (shouts from bed) Patty!
78) 2) dialog: It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video.
78) 6) dialog: I'm not yelling, Mom, I'm just frustrated because I should have my fucking wedding video! 53.
78) 10) dialog: 
78) 17) dialog:

83) 14) dialog: Mom? DOLORES SITS UP, STUNNED. PAT SR. ...hit your mother?!
83) 15) dialog: No, no, no, no, no! PAT SR. SLAPS PAT IN THE FACE TWICE. DOLORES REACTS.
83) 18) dialog: Get off me, Dad! PAT SR. PUSHES PAT DOWN ON THE BED, FIGHTING. DOLORES REACTS, STANDING UP.
83) 24) dialog: 
85) 3) dialog: Nikki is being manipulated and controlled. You have to talk to her.
85) 10) dialog: What explosion? No. Cliff is lying, that's not true. He's not allowed to talk about that. THE DOORBELL RINGS.
88) 2) dialog: You can't tell Nikki about this, Officer. 58.
88) 5) dialog: No, no! No!
88) 9) dialog: No, no, no, listen, sir.
90) 2) dialog: I'm sorry. I could just write you a letter and you could just let me have five minutes, explaining how much better I'm doing.
92) 2) dialog: ...this is not a reflection of where I'm at. You can't...please, you can't tell her any of this You can't tell Nikki about this.
92) 5) dialog: Who was that, Dad? PAT SR. It was that kid with the camera.
92) 7) dialog: Come on, don't write it up! I don't want her to see this! 60.
97) 7) dialog: 
97) 11) dialog: Weight lifting accident.
97) 13) dialog: Hey, this is my route, okay? Just back off.
97) 15) dialog: I like to run by myself, okay?
97) 17) dialog: (stops and turns) Hey, I like to run alone! Will you stop?
97) 19) dialog: Okay? I'm running here!
97) 21) dialog: Well then, why don't you run somewhere else? There's a fucking ton of roads to run in! What are you trying to do?
97) 23) dialog: 
97) 32) dialog: What the fuck?!
97) 33) dialog: I'm married!
97) 35) dialog: What the fuck are you doing? Your husband's dead!
97) 37) dialog: You're crazy!
97) 39) dialog: I'm not the big slut!
97) 41) dialog: 
98) 2) dialog: Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return `cause I could've killed him and I didn't. He's sixty-five years old. You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean....
98) 4) dialog: Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best.
98) 6) dialog: Yeah, but that's easier said than done.
98) 8) dialog: Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, okay?
98) 10) dialog: Why? 64.
98) 13) dialog: 
98) 16) dialog: Oh, I don't know, because I'm married and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months?
98) 18) dialog: Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.
98) 20) dialog: After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out." Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.
98) 22) dialog: She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same?
98) 25) dialog: Is that....? You're asking me, you're really asking me that question?
98) 27) dialog: With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts?
98) 29) dialog: No, not the books.
99) 9) dialog: How do you know when I run? 66.
99) 12) dialog: No, I'm not giving you a hard time.
99) 15) dialog:

102) 21) dialog: I ordered Raisin Bran because I didn't want there to be any mistaking this for a date.
102) 24) dialog: It's not a date. So how's your thing going -- your dancing thing?
102) 26) dialog: I wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing," but getting back with Nikki is, and I've been doing pretty well. Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.
102) 28) dialog: Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of control and that I'm actually doing really well. TIFFANY TAKES THIS IN. BEAT.

102) 59) dialog: She told you what to do?
102) 61) dialog: Oh...my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this. Made me feel like such a pervert. Maybe we should change the subject.
102) 63) dialog: You don't, do you.
102) 66) dialog: I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...was in the shower with the history teacher...

102) 95) dialog: "Sort of like you"? I hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that.
102) 98) dialog: Because, it's just not right, lumping you and I together, I mean, it's just wrong. And Nikki wouldn't like that. Especially after all the shit you just told me.

129) 40) dialog: "Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany. This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. I was moved to read about `Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki." PAT FOLDS UP THE LETTER AGAIN. He is kind of crying.
