62) 55) dialog: How did who die?
62) 60) dialog: Thank you.
62) 62) dialog: Oh, I didn't think you were.
62) 66) dialog: I just got fired, actually.
62) 69) dialog: Does it really matter?
62) 75) dialog: 
63) 4) dialog: It's a computer screen.
63) 8) dialog: It's a light. It's a...
63) 10) dialog: ...it's a drawer at a morgue where they pull out dead bodies and shoot them with formaldehyde.
63) 14) dialog: 
63) 18) dialog: In the middle of the wall?
64) 9) dialog: Of all the rooms there are iPod ports in, I'm happy you brought us into the bathroom.
65) 14) dialog: Why do you have to talk about me like that?
65) 16) dialog: Don't talk about me in the third person.
65) 18) dialog: I'm right here.
65) 21) dialog: Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.
65) 23) dialog: 
65) 26) dialog: Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor, but I agree, I wasn't as sharp, so I stopped. 46.
65) 29) dialog: Klonopin? (Chuckling) Yeah.
65) 31) dialog: Jesus.
65) 33) dialog: Trazodone!
65) 34) dialog: 
65) 36) dialog: God, I bet it does.
65) 38) dialog: I'm tired. I wanna go.
65) 40) dialog: I said I'm tired. (to Pat) Are you gonna walk me home or what?
65) 42) dialog: Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me home?
65) 45) dialog: I have a problem? You say more inappropriate things than appropriate things. You scare people.
65) 47) dialog: What? I'm not telling the truth? Veronica and Ronnie are very uncomfortable.
65) 50) dialog: Stop talking about me in third person.
65) 52) dialog: You love it when I have problems. You love it, Von, because then you can be the good one. Just say it.
65) 55) dialog: Oh, God.
65) 57) dialog: Nothing's my problem! I'm fine. I'm tired and I wanna go. (to Pat) Come on, are you ready? Pat stands. 48.
65) 60) dialog: Yes, I really wanna go! It's been great.
65) 62) dialog: Sorry. I don't wanna wake up the baby. Bye. PAT FOLLOWS TIFFANY.
66) 2) dialog: This is me. TIFFANY AND PAT STOP, FACE EACH OTHER.
66) 3) dialog: Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage so I don't really remember how this works.
66) 5) dialog: I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it, don't lie. We're not liars like they are. I live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us. I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner because I hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay? PAT IS MOMENTARILY SPEECHLESS. 49.
66) 8) dialog: Old enough to have a marriage end and not wind up in a mental hospital.
66) 10) dialog: You're married? So am I. TIFFANY HOLDS UP HER HAND, DISPLAYING HER WEDDING RING.
97) 5) dialog: 
97) 9) dialog: What happened to your face? 61.
97) 12) dialog: That sounds like bullshit. Why'd you run by my house? Did our little conversation get you upset last night?
97) 14) dialog: This is my neighborhood. You just ran by my house.
97) 16) dialog: Me too.
97) 18) dialog: What?
97) 20) dialog: Me too!
97) 22) dialog: I like this road. This is my neighborhood.
97) 25) dialog: Calm down, crazy. PAT SPITS. TIFFANY SPITS. 62.
97) 30) dialog: Hey! TIFFANY REAPPEARS FROM ANOTHER ALLEY BEHIND PAT.
97) 34) dialog: So am I!
97) 36) dialog: Where is your wife?
97) 38) dialog: I'm not the one that just got out of that hospital in Baltimore.
97) 43) dialog: I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore. There's always gonna be a part of me that's sloppy and dirty, but I like that, with all the other parts of myself. Can you say the same about yourself, fucker?! Can you forgive? Are you any good at that? TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS. 63.
99) 8) dialog: Hey! THEY RUN.
99) 11) dialog: I wanted to clarify something. I just want us to be friends. (Pat doesn't answer) Did you hear what I said? (Pat doesn't answer still) Why are you giving me such a hard time?
99) 14) dialog: I don't know how to act with you when you do this shit. PAT STOPS.
99) 17) dialog: Pick me up at seven thirty. SHE RUNS AND EXITS.
100) 7) dialog: Hi.
102) 6) dialog: Thank you. PAT LOOKS AT THE MENU. THE WAITRESS STANDS, WAITING.
102) 8) dialog: Tea. THE WAITRESS TAKES THE MENUS FROM THEM AND WALKS AWAY.
102) 11) dialog: Thanks. THE WAITRESS ENTERS L. WITH THEIR ORDER.
102) 13) dialog: Thank you. PAT POURS HIS CEREAL INTO A BOWL. PAUSES.
102) 15) dialog: Why did you order Raisin Bran?
102) 19) dialog: 
102) 22) dialog: 
102) 25) dialog: It's good. How's your restraining order?
102) 27) dialog: And the so-called incident with the weights.
102) 29) dialog: I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister. PAT CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE IS HEARING.
102) 32) dialog: I'd have to hide it from Veronica. She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing.
102) 34) dialog: I'd have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family, you should hear how I lost my job.
102) 36) dialog: By...having sex with everybody in the office.
102) 38) dialog: I was very depressed after Tommy died. It was a lot of people.
102) 40) dialog: Thanks.
102) 42) dialog: Eleven.
102) 44) dialog: I know.
102) 46) dialog: Okay.
102) 49) dialog: Yes.
102) 51) dialog: Yes.
102) 53) dialog: Hot.
102) 56) dialog: Made me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah.
102) 58) dialog: Mm-hmm.
102) 60) dialog: Mm-hmm.
102) 62) dialog: I don't mind it.
102) 64) dialog: No. But then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom...and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me. So I accused him of harassment and then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds. 71.
102) 67) dialog: I heard about that.
102) 69) dialog: Wow.
102) 71) dialog: Yeah.
102) 73) dialog: You do.
102) 75) dialog: Me too.
102) 77) dialog: Yeah, let's get back to the letter.
102) 79) dialog: Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that.
102) 82) dialog: Can I at least finish my tea?
102) 84) dialog: My tea. Can I finish it?
102) 86) dialog: I kinda got that feeling, yeah.
102) 88) dialog: Yeah, she said you were cool, basically.
102) 90) dialog: No, she said you were cool, but you know.
102) 92) dialog: Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax.
102) 94) dialog: Sort of like me.
102) 96) dialog: Why? 73.
102) 99) dialog: You think that I'm crazier than you.
102) 103) dialog: Oh, my God. Ugh. You're killing me. You know what? Forget I offered to help you. Forget the entire fucking idea. `Cause that must have been fucking crazy because I am so much crazier than you.
102) 105) dialog: I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband! HALLOWEEN DINERS LOOK.
102) 106) dialog: Forget it!
102) 110) dialog: Fuck you!
102) 114) dialog: You shut the fuck up!
105) 3) dialog: Yes, you do.
105) 5) dialog: You told your therapist that you were in a superior mental illness category, didn't you?
105) 7) dialog: Just leave me alone! 75.
105) 10) dialog: You may not have experienced the shit that I did. But you loved hearing about it, didn't you? You are afraid to be alive, you're afraid to live. You're a hypocrite. You're a conformist. You're a liar. I opened up to you and you judged me. You are an asshole. You are an asshole! TIFFANY GRABS PAT'S JACKET COLLAR.
105) 11) dialog: Get off of me! (yelling) Get off! You're harassing me!
105) 13) dialog: 
105) 16) dialog: Get off!
105) 20) dialog: 
105) 33) dialog: It's the kids! [Walks to Pat and Officer Keogh]. He didn't do anything, it was all the kids. Officer Keogh turns to push the crowd back.
105) 36) dialog: You gonna go your whole life scared of that song? It's just a song. Don't make it a monster. She leans close to Pat's downcast face. 77.
105) 38) dialog: There's no song playing. There's no song. Breathe, count backwards from ten. That's it. Pat breathes, listens to her. Calms himself. Song stops. Tiffany's face stays close to his.
105) 39) dialog: That's it. There you go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
105) 41) dialog: I took it too far.
105) 44) dialog: No, no. No, this was just a joke. This is a joke I started.
105) 46) dialog: I know, I have a stupid sense of humor.
105) 48) dialog: Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you? I'm sorry.
105) 50) dialog: Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus the whore thing for the most part.
106) 0) text: TIFFANY WALKS - upset, vulnerable. Pat walks behind, CATC UP TO TIFFANY AND THEY WALK TOGETHER.
106) 2) dialog: I know. I know you didn't mean it.
106) 4) dialog: I know, you say shit you don't mean all the time.
106) 6) dialog: I'll still give your letter to Nikki, don't worry. TIFFANY WALKS THE DRIVEWAY TOWARD HER GARAGE. Pat watches go.
106) 8) dialog: 
106) 11) dialog: 
112) 3) dialog: I can't, I can't do it. 85.
112) 6) dialog: I can't give the letter to Nikki.
112) 8) dialog: Because what am I getting in return? What are you doing for me?
112) 10) dialog: I know.
112) 12) dialog: Because I do this time after time after time, I do all this shit for other people and then I wake up and, and I'm empty, I have nothing!
112) 14) dialog: I always get myself in these fucking situations. I give everything to other people and nobody ever, I never -- I don't get what I want, okay? I'm not my sister. Pat takes this in.
112) 16) dialog: I can't do it.
112) 21) dialog: There's this thing.
112) 23) dialog: It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a, it's a dance thing.
112) 25) dialog: It's a competition thing at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Tommy would never do it with me and I missed it every single year.
112) 27) dialog: Would you please!
112) 29) dialog: Can we have one conversation without you reminding me that my goddamn husband is dead? My God.
112) 31) dialog: But I can only do it if I have a partner...and now I'm about to miss it for another year.
112) 34) dialog: What, your schedule is so busy? "Grapes of Wrath" and watching football with your dad?
112) 36) dialog: All right, then I'm not giving her your fucking letter. TIFFANY WALKS AWAY.
112) 38) dialog: 
112) 39) dialog: Think about it. TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS.
112) 41) dialog: 
112) 44) dialog: What? Jordie?
112) 47) dialog: Couldn't you say the same about you and Nikki? 88.
112) 50) dialog: How are you in love? Tell me about that. The big Nikki love. Tell me about it, I wanna understand it.
112) 52) dialog: Wow.
112) 55) dialog: It's gonna be amazing, and you're gonna be amazing, and she's gonna be amazing, and you're not gonna be that guy that's gonna take advantage of a situation without offering to do something back. So think about the dance thing. TIFFANY TURNS AND WALKS. PRELAP OF EAGLES GAME FADES IN. 89.
116) 2) dialog: I used the insurance money to build this. I designed it. All the floors are hard oak. It has good bounce for dancers.
116) 4) dialog: I'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares? It's therapy and it's fun. And the walls are good `cause I can play music really loud without anybody hearing.
116) 6) dialog: Upstairs. It's a garage, I just renovated it. You know, I was thinking about putting a ballet barre here.
116) 8) dialog: What?
116) 10) dialog: Probably tonight.
116) 13) dialog: Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna see her tonight.
116) 16) dialog: Mm-hmm.
116) 19) dialog: 
116) 22) dialog: Yeah. I mean, I hope so.
116) 25) dialog: Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's really generous.
116) 27) dialog: Yeah.
116) 29) dialog: Uh-huh. 99.
116) 31) dialog: All right, let's start simple. Start at that corner, walk towards me. Walk across the room. Pat stands in the corner, doesn't move.
116) 33) dialog: Are you fucking kidding me?
116) 35) dialog: A deal is a deal.
116) 37) dialog: Why don't you walk towards me like I'm Nikki. And the only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk. By your slow walk. You can't talk.
116) 39) dialog: Only walk. Do it.
116) 41) dialog: No walk, no letter. Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on. Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.
116) 43) dialog: Don't look up until you're halfway here. 100.
116) 47) dialog: That's right. PAT WALKS TO HER.
116) 48) dialog: Not yet.
116) 51) dialog: Yes. Do you feel that? That's emotion.
116) 53) dialog: Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?
116) 55) dialog: We were married for three years and five days, and I loved him. But for the last couple months, I just wasn't into sex at all. It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed. Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself. I don't think that makes me a criminal. Anyway one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going. And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed. And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat. (pause) That's a feeling. PAT, VISIBLY UPSET, WATCHES AS TIFFANY TURNS TO HER IPOD.
116) 63) dialog: Okay, this is the waltz. I'm gonna teach you the waltz step.
124) 4) dialog: Football stays out of this place, so does "Lord of the Flies."
124) 6) dialog: I don't give a fuck.
126) 2) dialog: What? You're not gonna read that shit on my time. I can tell you all about the "Lord of the Flies." It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch -- they have a shell -- and whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk. And if you don't have the conch, then you don't have the power. And then there's a little chubby boy, and they call him Piggy and they're really mean, and then there's a murder. I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.
126) 11) dialog: Hello. Pat told me about you.
126) 14) dialog: What? He wrote about me? I'm "the girl"?
126) 16) dialog: What'd he say?
126) 19) dialog: No, please, tell me more about what he said in the letter. 105.
126) 22) dialog: Cool.
126) 29) dialog: Okay. SHE TURNS ON MUSIC: PAT AND TIFFANY DANCE SIDE BY SIDE.
126) 30) dialog: And then this goes into something else.
126) 34) dialog: No.
126) 38) dialog: No, please.
126) 72) dialog: Bye! 108.
129) 7) dialog: I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that.
129) 9) dialog: These are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move. It's not ready yet. And we don't have a move yet.
129) 11) dialog: Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?
129) 13) dialog: Guess what?
129) 15) dialog: Nikki replied to your letter. TIFFANY STEPS TO THE STAIRCASE, LIFTING AN ENVELOPE.
129) 16) dialog: 
129) 26) dialog: I just hope you can handle it.
129) 29) dialog: She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.
129) 31) dialog: Try to stay positive. PAT'S HANDS UNFOLD THE TYPED LETTER.
129) 33) dialog: No. PAT LOOKS DOWN AT THE LETTER, READING SILENTLY.
129) 34) dialog: I thought you were gonna read it out loud.
129) 42) dialog: (follows him to door) She said to show her something, Pat. This dance can be that something. You would have never done something like this in a million years. It shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels: focus, collaboration, discipline. It's romantic, like I said it would be. It's for her.
133) 29) dialog: We need to talk right now! When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up!
133) 33) dialog: Oh, really? 123.
133) 37) dialog: Well, that sounds great, Pat. That's great for all of them, but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help. I'm Tiffany, by the way. PAT SR. What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell?
133) 39) dialog: You think I fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you? PAT SR. Ever since, ever since he was with you, ever since--
133) 40) dialog: 
133) 42) dialog: I'm the reason why today happened? PAT SR. I think so.
133) 43) dialog: Let's talk about that. 124.
133) 46) dialog: The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six. The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS.
133) 48) dialog: The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty- seven to fourteen.
133) 50) dialog: The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two.
133) 52) dialog: Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven. PAT SR. He was with you?
133) 53) dialog: He was with me. We went for a run.
133) 56) dialog: There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.
133) 58) dialog: Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? (to Pat Sr.) Do you? Do you know? "Excelsior." Look it up. Yeah, "Excelsior."
133) 60) dialog: Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation.
133) 63) dialog: I did my research. SHE SNAPS OFF A BEER BOTTLE CAP AND DRINKS. PAT SR. Well, I gotta say, I'm impressed.
133) 64) dialog: Thank you. PAT SR. I gotta rethink this whole thing. I didn't trust it before, but I gotta say, now I do. 126.
133) 68) dialog: Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You live for this shit. You've been betting against my father for years.
133) 70) dialog: You're twisting the knife right now. You get off on it!
133) 72) dialog: You get off on it! If not, then prove it. Prove it. PAT SR. Yeah, prove it, prove it!
133) 74) dialog: By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing.
133) 77) dialog: No. 127.
133) 79) dialog: Against the Cowboys. EVERYONE GASPS.
133) 80) dialog: That's your team isn't it, Randy?
133) 82) dialog: I know who his team is.
133) 84) dialog: December twenty-eight, last game of the season.
133) 86) dialog: Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition.
133) 88) dialog: Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team?
133) 113) dialog: They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. You have to average the four judges' scores.
133) 116) dialog: We don't suck. Pat's a beginner, I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there.
133) 118) dialog: They're good. Some of them are professionals.
133) 123) dialog: Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a break!
133) 126) dialog: We can do a five.
133) 135) dialog: Pat, you can't quit.
133) 137) dialog: Pat, calm down. Thank about it.
133) 139) dialog: Pat, no. PAT SR. What are you doing?
133) 140) dialog: Pat. 132.
133) 146) dialog: You are not a stand up guy right now. If it's me reading the signs...if it's me reading the
133) 151) dialog: You are not a stand up guy!
134) 7) dialog: There's only one way to get him to show. PAT SR. What's that?
134) 9) dialog: We have to tell him Nikki's gonna be there. They stare at her.
136) 2) dialog: We have to tell him that she's coming. PAT SR. We have to tell him that she's going.
136) 4) dialog: It's a white lie. 134.
136) 7) dialog: There's no other way. PAT SR. You know, we gotta leave a trail of bread crumbs so that he can live his life without ruining it.
136) 9) dialog: We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be there. PAT SR.
136) 11) dialog: We have to do it.
136) 13) dialog: Yeah. A little bit. But it's for the best.
140) 2) dialog: Hey. PAT ENTERS, SITS DOWN NEXT TO HER.
140) 4) dialog: It's fine. TIFFANY WRAPS DUCT TAPE AROUND PAT'S SNEAKER. HE WATCHES HER CAREFULLY, stares at her. Thinking.
143) 2) dialog: This isn't working! TIFFANY YANKS OFF THE NECKTIE AND STEPS. PAT WATCHES.
143) 3) dialog: Stupid! TIFFANY'S HANDS SORTS THROUGH A BOX OF TIES ON THE BED. TIFFANY HOLDS ANOTHER TIE. SHE PLACES IT AROUND HIS NECK. PAT WATCHES HER. TIFFANY STRUGGLES TO TIE THE TIE. SHE WORKS. CAMERA TILTS UP ONTO PAT'S FACE.
143) 4) dialog: This just isn't working! SHE WALKS WITH THE TIE.
143) 11) dialog: I'm not.
143) 13) dialog: I'm focused.
145) 4) dialog: Shit.
145) 17) dialog: The birds are better when Pat is with me. We settled that. PAT SR. Stay for the next quarter.
145) 27) dialog: What? I thought you were doing it.
146) 2) dialog: I want you to remember everything. I want you to remember all of the good stuff that we have here.
146) 4) dialog: Just check in. I gotta go find Veronica. PAT STEPS TO THE REGISTRATION TABLE.
146) 10) dialog: 
147) 2) dialog: 
147) 5) dialog: You're killing me. You're killing me!
147) 7) dialog: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
147) 9) dialog: 
147) 12) dialog: Bartender! Bartender, can I get a vodka, please? SPECTATORS APPLAUD, PAT WALKS, LOOKING AROUND. SPECTATORS APPLAUD.
147) 18) dialog: Sure.
147) 31) dialog: So what do you do?
147) 33) dialog: Oh, the arguing kind.
149) 21) dialog: I've had two vodkas.
149) 23) dialog: We're in what?
149) 26) dialog: You know, I used to think that you were the best thing that ever happened to me, but now I think that you might maybe be the worst thing and I'm sorry that I ever met you.
151) 6) dialog: Got it.
151) 16) text: on' to him. STEVIE WONDER'S `DON'T YOU WORRY `BOUT A THING' STARTS. PAT AND TIFFANY DANCE, as Danny taught them. PAT SR. WATCHES with Danny.
