4) 1) dialog: He’s doing great.
4) 3) dialog: That’s doing chemo. It’s his stomach cells dying. And being reborn. Right now - we’re waging war. Total war. Inside Matt’s body. And the battle is just beginning.
29) 16) dialog: His skin may well turn black. Start peeling off. Perfectly normal. It’s a bit early. But that could be a good sign. He pulls a thermometer out of Matt’s mouth.
29) 17) dialog: No fever - excellent. Less nausea? Good. Even a bit of appetite. Outstanding. And no visual or auditory hallucinations or other behavioral abnormalities? She’s silent for a beat. The Doctor looks up at her, and Matt. Matt looks at her - worried she’s going to mention morning...

Tumors cause hallucinations, delusions, sudden changes in behavior and the drugs might have exacerbated them. Sara and Peter visibly react to this. DR. BROOKS (CONT’D) But it’s alright. Matt’s MRI’s are all clear. He has no brain tumors. Whatever caused the behaviors, or hallucinations, it isn’t that. 48.
71) 6) dialog: This is the crucial time. He’s had a complete round of treatments now. By the trial protocols we can’t give him anymore. And I don’t think his body could tolerate it.
71) 8) dialog: We wait and see. He’s still a great candidate for this treatment. Age counts enormously. And attitude.
71) 10) dialog: There’s a number of good drugs. It’s quite common for cancer patients to take something for anxiety or depression.
71) 12) dialog: The point is not to let his attitude interfere with the medicine. Make sure he gets well. The rest will work itself out.

140) 1) dialog: The markings are gone. The skin is really an extension of the mind. Just some kind of dermatitis. Dermographia. Nothing dangerous. They look relieved. But the Doctor looks grim. DR. BROOKS (CONT’D) But we ran his panels. I’m afraid it’s not good news. The treatment has frankly had no effect. His cell count is worse than before.
140) 3) dialog: I wish I could tell you there was. I believe in fighting till you die. But not fighting when you’re dead. With these numbers I have no idea what’s keeping him alive.
