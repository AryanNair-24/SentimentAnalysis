0) 8) dialog: I'm looking for a car.
0) 12) dialog: Exactly where I want to be.
1) 11) dialog: Professor Zundapp?
1) 26) dialog: 
14) 14) dialog: That's because it's air-cooled.
14) 18) dialog: Not here.
14) 24) dialog: So the lab boys analyzed the photo I sent? What did they learn about the camera?
14) 28) dialog: This was London's message? 27.
14) 33) dialog: How did we miss that?
14) 38) dialog: Who is it? Has anyone seen the photo yet?
14) 42) dialog: 
14) 46) dialog: Oh no.
14) 51) dialog: Change of plan. You're meeting the American.
14) 56) dialog: Those thugs down there were on the oil platform. If they see me, the whole mission is compromised.
14) 60) dialog: You are now.
18) 5) dialog: What's the problem, Shiftwell?
18) 10) dialog: So go in!
18) 14) dialog: Time is of the essence, Shiftwell.
25) 28) dialog: It's his cover. One of the best I've seen, too. Look at the detail on that rust. It must have cost him a fortune.
25) 32) dialog: There's probably heat on him. Be patient.
25) 36) dialog: And then we find out who's behind all this.
25) 99) dialog: What is it?
25) 106) dialog: Anyone with him? He won't be alone.
25) 167) dialog: Then this shouldn't hurt at all.
25) 171) dialog: Miss Shiftwell?
27) 23) dialog: I never properly introduced myself. Finn McMissile. British Intelligence.
27) 27) dialog: Who are you with? FBI, CIA?
27) 34) dialog: You're being followed.
27) 46) dialog: Don't worry.
27) 49) dialog: I've taken care of that. Hang on.
28) 9) dialog: Drive forward. Whatever you do, don't stop.
28) 25) dialog: Roger that.
28) 34) dialog: 
28) 48) dialog: Hold on, Sid!
31) 3) dialog: Now that's how I like to start the day! You never feel more alive than when you're almost dead.
31) 33) dialog: Finally. Time to see who's behind all this.
31) 47) dialog: Holley.
31) 54) dialog: Holley, in how many makes and models did this type of engine appear?
31) 71) dialog: This seems like a dead end. If there were something in the photo that could narrow this down a bit I'd be a lot happier.
31) 77) dialog: That's something we can track.
31) 82) dialog: Well done, Mater! I would never have seen that.
31) 88) dialog: You obviously have plenty of experience in the field.
31) 92) dialog: You're helping me. Please, Mater.
31) 96) dialog: Right. And I'm just in the import/export business. Siddeley?
31) 100) dialog: Paris. Tout de suite.
31) 110) dialog: Is there any other way?
33) 3) dialog: 
33) 8) dialog: Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at anyone. And absolutely, positively no idling. Are we clear?
33) 12) dialog: Mater?
33) 16) dialog: We're not here to go shopping.
34) 10) dialog: There you are.
34) 15) dialog: Mater, get back!
34) 26) dialog: 
34) 31) dialog: Mater! This chap needs a tow. Hook him up.
35) 3) dialog: (to the cars) Allez! Maintenant - vite!
35) 9) dialog: Easy, Tomber. This is her first field assignment - she didn't know you were my informant.
35) 17) dialog: Tomber was doing 20 to life in a Moroccan impound the first time I saved him, if I recall correctly.
35) 32) dialog: Do those parts look familiar, Tomber?
35) 43) dialog: "Lemon?"
35) 47) dialog: Holley, pull up the pictures from the oil platform. I want to know what other type of cars were out there.
35) 52) dialog: Mater, are these cars considered lemons?
35) 59) dialog: And they're all taking their orders from the car behind this engine.
35) 63) dialog: What, Tomber? 69.
35) 68) dialog: Where's this meeting taking place?
35) 74) dialog: Then there's a good chance our mystery engine will be there too.
35) 78) dialog: Holley, contact Stephenson and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon. Good work.
37) 21) dialog: Of course. They must be the heads of the lemon families.
37) 25) dialog: We've got to infiltrate that meeting. It's the only way to find out who's behind all this.
37) 39) dialog: Good job, Miss Shiftwell.
41) 2) dialog: Thank you, Stephenson.
41) 7) dialog: Perfect.
41) 37) dialog: The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater.
41) 43) dialog: And leave the rest to us.
41) 74) dialog: Friendships can be dangerous in our line of work, Mater.
41) 78) dialog: Right. And Miss Shiftwell's is designing iPhone apps.
41) 84) dialog: In the meantime...
41) 87) dialog: You look a little light on weapons.
45) 31) dialog: You're on any moment now.
48) 3) dialog: He's so good.
50) 2) dialog: Here we go.
52) 2) dialog: Descramble that voice!
54) 2) dialog: What just happened?
56) 2) dialog: Holley?
56) 10) dialog: Where?
59) 4) dialog: Get out of the way! Andate!
60) 13) dialog: No!
68) 9) dialog: We're in London, Mater. Inside Big Bentley.
70) 11) dialog: Don't be a fool, Mater.
70) 15) dialog: When did I... Oh. Mater, I was complimenting you on what a good spy you are.
70) 26) dialog: I know.
75) 53) dialog: Nice try, Mater.
75) 74) dialog: There's no time. McQueen needs your help, Mater. 108.
75) 79) dialog: It's up to you. Go to the pits and get everyone out. You can do that.
75) 83) dialog: We'll be okay.
77) 5) dialog: He wouldn't have left if I'd told him the truth. (re: his death trap) Being killed by a clock. Gives a whole new meaning to "your time has come."
77) 13) dialog: What are you doing?
77) 21) dialog: Good job! Quick thinking, Holley!
79) 5) dialog: Drive!
79) 8) dialog: Burn rubber!!
79) 12) dialog: We've got to get to the course. Calculate the fastest way to ---
79) 18) dialog: 
79) 23) dialog: You kids get all the good hardware.
79) 28) dialog: I knew his escape was too easy.
82) 2) dialog: Mater, listen to me. The bomb is on you.
82) 5) dialog: They knew you'd try to help McQueen. When we were knocked out they planted it in your air filter.
89) 3) dialog: Holley. I'll get Zundapp, you help Mater.
91) 10) dialog: Do you really think I'm going to let you float away, Professor?
94) 23) dialog: Turn off the bomb, Zundapp!
94) 47) dialog: 
94) 129) dialog: Where's he going?
95) 24) dialog: Mater, I don't know what you're doing but stand down now!
95) 72) dialog: Mater, he created Allinol.
95) 92) dialog: Mater!
95) 108) dialog: The engine from the photo.
100) 19) dialog: Our satellites picked up an urgent communique.
100) 61) dialog: We couldn't figure that one out either.
103) 11) dialog: We've got another mission, Mater. Just stopped by here to "pick something up."
103) 16) dialog: Her Majesty asked for you personally, Mater.
103) 23) dialog: Spy or not, you're still the smartest, most honest chap we've ever met.
103) 35) dialog: If there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.
