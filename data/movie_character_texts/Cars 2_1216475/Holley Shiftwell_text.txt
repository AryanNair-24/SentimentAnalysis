14) 12) dialog: A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator.
14) 16) dialog: I'm Agent Shiftwell, Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station. I have a message from London.
14) 26) dialog: It appears to be a standard television camera. They said if you could get closer photos next time, that would be great.
14) 31) dialog: Oh -- no, no. No sir. Um, the oil platforms you were on? Turns out they're sitting on the biggest oil reserve in the world.
14) 35) dialog: They'd been scrambling everyone's satellites. The Americans actually discovered it just before you did. They placed an agent on that platform, under deep cover. He was able to get a photo of the car who's running the entire operation.
14) 40) dialog: No, not yet. The American is here tonight to pass it to you. He'll signal you when he's ready.
14) 49) dialog: What is it?
14) 53) dialog: What, me? 28.
14) 58) dialog: No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm in Diagnostics. I'm not a field agent.
18) 3) dialog: Oh, you've got to be joking.
18) 7) dialog: He's in the loo. 33.
18) 12) dialog: I can't just go into the men's loo.
20) 21) dialog: Hello.
20) 25) dialog: A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator.
20) 29) dialog: 
20) 35) dialog: Yeah. Okay, I get it---
20) 40) dialog: Listen! We should find somewhere more private.
20) 44) dialog: 
20) 49) dialog: Got it. We'll rendezvous then.
25) 26) dialog: Why is he in the pits? He's so exposed.
25) 30) dialog: But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
25) 34) dialog: Right, of course. He'll signal us when he can.
25) 97) dialog: Hold on. I think I've got something.
25) 101) dialog: The Pacer from the party last night.
25) 104) dialog: Cross-referencing with the photos from the oil derricks... Yep. His VIN numbers match.
25) 108) dialog: Conducting analysis on the target.
25) 111) dialog: He's not the only one here. Three... five... they're everywhere. And they're all closing in on... oh no.
25) 114) dialog: Finn? Finn, where are you?
25) 153) dialog: 
25) 174) dialog: I've got him in the back alleys east of the garages. Multiple assailants are closing in quickly.
28) 40) dialog: Come on! Get in here! 58.
31) 5) dialog: 
31) 15) dialog: Still in one piece, great.
31) 21) dialog: Downloading the photo now.
31) 27) dialog: Oh yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell. Holley Shiftwell.
31) 36) dialog: (to Mater, expectantly) What is this? 61.
31) 41) dialog: Yes, OK, right. But who's engine is this, Mater?
31) 45) dialog: But you're the one who took it.
31) 49) dialog: Oh, right. Yes, of course. "A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed." Sorry.
31) 57) dialog: It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period. At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine.
31) 63) dialog: 
31) 68) dialog: Just pay attention.
31) 75) dialog: Rare parts.
31) 79) dialog: Exactly!
31) 105) dialog: 
33) 6) dialog: No VIN scans. Got it.
33) 10) dialog: Yes, right. No idling. Yes, sir.
34) 29) dialog: But I thought ---
35) 11) dialog: Informant? 67.
35) 21) dialog: Alright, we get it. You both know each other, you're both old. So.
35) 24) dialog: There you go, informant. Inform us.
35) 36) dialog: To whom?
35) 50) dialog: Right. Let's see. There were Hugos. And Trunkovs.
35) 56) dialog: Finn. Everyone involved in this plot is one of history's biggest loser cars.
37) 10) dialog: Well, I remotely reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light cameras to do recognition scans.
37) 14) dialog: Thank you. I think.
37) 27) dialog: 
37) 32) dialog: Hold still.
37) 42) dialog: Thank you, Finn.
41) 5) dialog: That should just about do it.
41) 9) dialog: So Mater, it's voice-activated. But you know, everything's voice- activated these days. 75.
41) 45) dialog: Now hold still.
41) 48) dialog: I have to do the final fitting on your disguise.
41) 51) dialog: Oh dear. That's no good.
41) 56) dialog: The disguise won't calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto.
41) 60) dialog: I was.
41) 64) dialog: Your dents are valuable?
41) 72) dialog: So you were being serious in Paris? McQueen isn't just part of your cover?
41) 82) dialog: It's okay. Say no more. I'll work around the dent.
45) 7) dialog: Scusatemi, tutti! Signori!
45) 10) dialog: Mio nonno, my grandfather, has broken down. If one of you would help I would be so thankful.
45) 20) dialog: No, no, don't fight over me.
45) 23) dialog: Signore Tow Truck, per favore?
45) 46) dialog: Why aren't you in disguise?
45) 50) dialog: Come on, there's no time. Go!
46) 13) dialog: He's in.
47) 25) dialog: (cutting in to his
52) 4) dialog: (already on it) I'm trying... It's too sophisticated!
54) 4) dialog: (analyzing the data) I'm working on it.
56) 4) dialog: I'm detecting an extremely strong electromagnetic pulse.
56) 8) dialog: Finn, it's the camera!
56) 12) dialog: On the tower.
62) 3) dialog: Finn.
64) 3) dialog: Mater. Abort the mission. They've got Finn. Get out of there. Get out of there right now!
70) 24) dialog: Finn, he's not joking.
75) 68) dialog: Mater!
75) 85) dialog: Go and get some more dents, Mater.
77) 3) dialog: So we'll be "okay"? Really?
77) 8) dialog: Time. That's it!
77) 15) dialog: Trying to turn back time. If I can just reverse the polarity...
79) 3) dialog: Oh no!
79) 15) dialog: Done. 110.
79) 21) dialog: They're standard issue now.
79) 26) dialog: Oh no. That's Mater's.
90) 3) dialog: Got it!
93) 15) dialog: Mater, stop!
93) 20) dialog: Oh no.
94) 3) dialog: Mater, we've got to get that bomb off you. 118.
94) 36) dialog: Say it!
94) 50) dialog: He was getting on my nerves.
95) 41) dialog: O-kay...
95) 61) dialog: But Sir Axlerod created the race, Mater. Why would he want to hurt anyone?
95) 94) dialog: Mater!
95) 110) dialog: It's a perfect match!
100) 9) dialog: No, you're quite right. It does sound a bit far-fetched.
100) 14) dialog: Hello, Mater. It's so nice to see you again.
100) 26) dialog: I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so nice to meet you all.
100) 48) dialog: Oh no no. I'm keeping that dent. It's way too valuable.
100) 63) dialog: Our investigation proved that Allinol was actually gasoline. And Miles Axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam it would explode.
103) 6) dialog: Finn, time to go. Siddeley's gassed, geared and ready to fly.
103) 20) dialog: We know. 134.
103) 25) dialog: Don't forget massively charming.
103) 33) dialog: That's alright, we understand. But I'll be back. You still owe me that first date.
