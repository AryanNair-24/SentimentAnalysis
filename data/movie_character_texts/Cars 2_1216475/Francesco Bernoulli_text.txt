13) 60) dialog: Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are very good-looking. Not as good as I thought, but you're good.
13) 65) dialog: Anything for McQueen's friend.
13) 70) dialog: Oooh. 24.
13) 75) dialog: Hey, she has good taste.
13) 83) dialog: Francesco is familiar with this reaction to Francesco. Women respect a car that has nothing to hide.
13) 87) dialog: Let us have a toast.
13) 92) dialog: (raising a drink) I dedicate my win tomorrow... to Miss Sally.
13) 107) dialog: Yes, you will see Francesco. But not like this.
13) 110) dialog: You will see him like this, as he drives away from you.
13) 115) dialog: No.
25) 9) dialog: Really? You are "speed"? Then Francesco is triple speed. (closes his eyes) Francesco. Is. Triple speed. Francesco likes this, McQueen. It's really getting him into the zone!
25) 195) dialog: Grazie and arrivaderci!
26) 5) dialog: Strategia? Francesco needs no strategy, it's very simple. You start the race, wait for Lightning McQueen to choke, pass him, then win. Francesco always wins. It's boring.

43) 65) dialog: For famous race cars like Francesco and well... you, to be far away from home is not easy.
43) 69) dialog: Is no insult. When Francesco is away from home, he misses his mama just like you miss your tow truck amico.
43) 73) dialog: Of course, I am at home. And my mama is right here.
43) 76) dialog: 
43) 81) dialog: McQueen is very sad! I will beat his cry-baby bottom today!

101) 18) dialog: Signorina Sally. It is official: Lightning McQueen is the luckiest car in the world.
101) 23) dialog: Which he will have to be to have a chance against Francesco today.
101) 27) dialog: See you at the finish line, Mc---
101) 30) dialog: What is that?
101) 35) dialog: Is good, McQueen. Very funny. It was funnier when I did it, but it's very funny. What are you going to do next? Are you going to take off your fenders? Try it. You'll like it.
104) 13) dialog: Impossible!
