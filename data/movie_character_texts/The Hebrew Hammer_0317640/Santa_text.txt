9) 1) dialog: I want to start by thanking all of you for pulling yourselves away from the workshop to make this emergency meeting. I know it's the busiest time of the year for all of you, so I'll try and be brief.
9) 2) text: As Santa speaks, we begin on a painting of a meek and frightened looking Santa Claus. His eyes look fearfully t his right.  Below the picture frame is a plaque reading " Nick the Nervous. 1871-1941", we continue a slow DOLLY to right on to the next picture. We see another Santa Claus, much more treacherous in his appearance. His eyes are fixed menacingly on the picture Santa to his left. The plaque below his picture read, "St Nick The Nasty 1941-1970." We continue our DOLLY to the right, finally ending on a painting of a jolly, portly Santa. Below his picture the plaque reads, "St. Nick The Nice. 1970-Christmas Present. We cut to a WIDE shot of a Conference Room. The same nice Santa Claus from the last picture addresses a handful of ELVES. Two reindeer flank Santa on either side. Their nameplates hang from their necks - "BLITZEN" and "RUDOLPH At the other end of the table from Santa sits his son DAM quite a nasty looking man. 
9) 3) dialog: My father, often referred to as St. Nick The Nasty, was a tyrannical man. He was obsessed with making Christmas the only holiday anyone could celebrate before the New Year. Since his death, I've prided myself on ensuring that the Christmas season is one of tolerance and understanding between all races and religions. It's always been my belief that Hanukkah and Kwanzaa deserve the same respect as Christmas. 
9) 5) dialog: Lights please.
9) 7) dialog: Over the course of my career as Santa Claus, I've made it my mission to ensure that Jews, Christians, and African Americans could all observe their respective holidays in harmony.
9) 8) text: We see a slide of THE HEBREW HAMMER, an African American (Mohammed), and Santa Claus arm in arm below a banner in mall reading "HAPPY HOLIDAYS!"
9) 9) dialog: I was responsible for pushing the Happy Holidays Ordinance, in which all Merry Christmas signage was replaced by the Trans-relgious and inoffensive phrase 'Happy Holidays.'
9) 11) dialog: It was nearly a decade ago, in conjunction with our friends in the Jewish and African American communities  that I supported a bill that mandated that 'Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel' and 'I'm dreaming of a bright Kwanzaa' be taught and sung in elementary schools along with the Christmas standards 'Frosty The Snowman', and 'Deck The Halls.'  Which is why upon examination of my annual naughty and nice list it shocked me to discover that my own son, Damian...
9) 12) text: Damian, preoccupied with the cigarette he's attempting to light, looks up in response to his name. A brown bagged bottle of booze now sits on the table in f of him. We can see Santa and the reindeer in silhouette o the slide projection screen behind him.
9) 13) dialog: The heir to the Red Suit could be so filled with hate. 
9) 14) text: Santa addresses Damian.
9) 15) dialog: Damian, when I learned of your ludicrous scheme to wipe out Hanukkah, my first reaction was one of disgust. Now, I'm only filled with sadness and disappointment. Disappointed that I failed to teach you the true meaning of Christmas. What do you have to say for yourself?
9) 18) text: On the slide projector screen behind Damian, we see the silhouetted images of Blitzen and Rudolph goring Santa through the chest with their antlers. Damian cringes. Blood trickles from Santa's mouth, and with his last brea he utters the words...
9) 19) dialog: Et tu, Blitzen?
9) 20) text: Santa falls out of frame with a thud. Standing behind him with bloodied antlers is Blitzen.  Damian walks over to the newly deceased Santa, takes his bloodstained Santa's hat, and put it on his own head. Fro this point on in the screenplay, Damian will now be refer to as SANTA. The elves in the room, in various stages of shock, stare their new master in horror.
9) 21) dialog: What are you fucking midgets looking at!? Get back to work! We have Hanukkah to destroy!
24) 0) text: Santa holds a walkie-talkie in hand and we the hear the v of the Salvation Navy Guy. Although behind him hangs a ba reading, "SANTA'S WORKSHOP," the interior is a run down sweatshop.

24) 3) text: Santa puts the walkie-talkie down, and addresses somebody O.S.
24) 4) dialog: With the Hebrew Hammer out of the picture, Hanukkah will be nothing more than a confusing and hard to pronounce word. I want to thank you very much Jamal for all of your help.
24) 5) text: We cut to the other side to reveal whom he's speaking to. Jamal, the same black 'elf' from the Kwanzaa Liberation F sits at the table across from Santa.
24) 7) dialog: Can you believe this guy Tiny Tim?
24) 8) text: Santa looks over to TINY TIM. Unshaven, not so tiny anymo and still on crutches, Tiny Tim's grown up since 'A Chris Carol.' A common street thug. C'mon, did you seriously th that Scrooge would give free handouts to the Cratchit fam forever? Tiny Tim shrugs his shoulders.
24) 9) dialog: Take a look around you Jamal. Do you see any colored midgets in my workshop?
24) 11) dialog: Your presence would be a disruption to the utopian model of efficiency I've created here.

24) 18) dialog: You know something, you're right.
24) 19) text: The Head Elf is taken aback by what seems to be a glimpse compassion on Santa's part.
24) 21) dialog: Yeah. This is a sweatshop. And since you elves aren't willing to do the work, I made arrangements to have some Taiwanese children shipped over. And I might add,  they're more than willing to work for peanuts.
24) 22) text: Santa performs the two fingered whistle.
24) 23) dialog: Come on in boys!

24) 31) dialog: Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
24) 34) dialog: Worse.
24) 35) text: Santa slits open one of the boxes with a large knife and pulls out a VIDEOCASSETTE generically labeled, "It's A Wonderful Life."

35) 68) text: Santa snaps his fingers, and Bambi and Tawni drape themse on either side of the Hammer, rubbing his arms erotically

35) 86) text: Santa stands up slowly with his hands raised.
35) 87) dialog: Well, it's a bit too late for that now, isn't it? Excuse me children, if I could have your attention for a moment.
35) 89) dialog: I'm just calming the kiddies.  (To children) There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
35) 92) dialog: In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year. 
35) 94) dialog: Why don't we show him how that makes us feel.

49) 22) text: You can feel the Robert Deniro-esque intensity boiling in of Santa.
49) 23) dialog: You gonna learn to guide this sled right? You gonna make sure your men follow suit? Because if I'm puking down chimneys come Christmas Eve, I'm gonna have your hide. We clear?
49) 24) text: Rudolph shakes his head. The bells on his harness tinkle. Santa continues to stare down the reindeer as he walks aw Rudolph is clearly broken, but continues staring back at Santa as he makes his way out of frame. The expression on Rudolph's face changes from fear to insolence as he angri follows the O.S. Santa. Suddenly, Santa charges right back into frame, and places drawn gun to Rudolph's temple.
49) 25) dialog: You eyeballin' me son!?

50) 1) dialog: The Jewish Atomic Clock.
50) 2) text: It's the kind of place where a giant telescope at an observatory would be housed. The clock is breathtaking in size. On its face, in place of the standard numerals are names of Jewish holidays. For example, "Yom Kipur" is whe the twelve should be, followed by "Passover", etc. In the center of the face, an odometer-like gauge reveals the ye '5734.' At its base, the brilliant blue Judeum glows brightly.  Santa barks out orders.
50) 3) dialog: Get moving! We've got work to do!
50) 4) text: One of the thugs pushes play on a ghetto blaster and the 'Santa Claus Is Coming To Town' begins to play. A few of the thugs insert a bicycle pump into the Judeum clock base and begin pumping.

Esther walks in through the front door and spots somethin O.S. that gives her cause for concern. Unbeknownst to the Hammer, the SNEAKY ELF picks up Santa' gun.  He raises it at the Hammer, ready to fire.
52) 16) text: The Hammer begins firing. In SLOW-MOTION, Tiny Tim hobbles as fast as he can toward overturned table, gunfire trailing him. Like a pole vaulter with two poles, Tiny Tim plants his crutches firmly into the ground and launches himself over table. He lands directly on top of Santa, who cowers underneath table.
52) 17) dialog: Get off of me you cripple!
52) 22) text: We cut back to Santa and Tiny Tim underneath the table. W HEAR the shooting continue to slow, until finally it ceas altogether. Santa and Tiny Tim exchange looks.

The Hammer stands motionless as the Elves gain ground. Right before they reach him, the Hammer quickly pulls his Talis off of his neck and holds it outstretched, clotheslining the two off of their mopeds.  The elves are out cold. The Hammer admires his work. Santa, running for his life, rounds the corner. He stops in his tracks as he spots the Hammer.
