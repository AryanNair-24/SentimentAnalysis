An underwater rollercoaster -- nightmarish, dizzying, claustrophobic. Abruptly--

A scavenger's den. Noland puts down the rifle. As he peels off his Ghillie s

As a confirmation, smoke -- grey-green and thick -- begin pour in through holes in the floor. FUBAR. They react. Some try to cover their mouths. Others attemp plug the vents.
