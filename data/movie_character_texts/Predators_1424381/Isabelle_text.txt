NIKOLAI, a frightening bear of a in VDV fatigues with no identity badges or insignias, arm with GShG-7.62 -- a four barreled gas powered rotary mach gun, its barrel still smoking -- is yelling in Russian at ISABELLE, jeans and button down shirt, pretty if she ever bothered to smile, her own Heckler & Koch PSG1 sniper rif pointed at the big man, as she yells back in French. What we have here is a failure to communicate. Heads and weapons turn to Royce, as he appears. Both yell him for a change. He raises his hands, indicating intention rather than surrender.

A cross between a tiger, a boar and your worst nightmare. Royce OPENS UP. Short, accurate bursts. Mombasa UNLEASHES with the AK. Hanzo -- three point stance, steady rate of fire, as if he was at a pistol range. Cuchillo’s Uzis BLA All of the above is muted by the ROAR of Nikolai’s chaing Its barrel spits out a foot of flame. Stream of high velo rounds -- every fifth a tracer -- digs into the creature. It SQUEALS as bullets tear it apart. A geyser of black bl Still, it crawls toward them, barbed tail lashing spastically. Nikolai - fuck me -- keeps firing. Finally the monstrosity halts. Marks its killers with cri eyes, as the light in them dims... and expires. More are coming. Could be three, could be six. Hard to te They are swift, vicious, closing in from three directions Our crew -- fight or flee -- flee it is -- retreat toward only avenue of the escape, laying cover fire, re-painting green with black. Still, they come. Stans’s had enough, breaks, vanishes into the jungle. A thing LUNGES for Isabelle, baring rows of jagged teeth. 22. She tracks it, taking her time... and... BAM! A 30. Magnum hollow point BLOWS its head apart mid-a Black mist. It lands, digging a furrow that ends at her feet.

29) 4) dialog: You don’t know that. Royce picks up a rock. Tosses it out into the field. It bounces once. Twice. A SUDDEN blur of steel, as something lashes out from bene the ground. DICES THE STONE TO SMITHEREENS. A chilling, bottomless beat. Like standing on the edge of abyss. And looking down.

41) 1) text: Edwin is pulled through some unseen vortex, Isabelle behi him. HER POV: Edwin jerked to the left, disappears. Beat, and sees where. An underwater tunnel, dark and slimy, like a path to hell 38. And she’s tumbling through it, walls rotating around her jagged rocks, sand, plants, fish, all a blur. An underwater rollercoaster -- nightmarish, dizzying, claustrophobic. Abruptly--

44) 10) dialog: Yes.
44) 12) dialog: It could see in infra red. Heat signatures. He used mud to block his. That’s how he was able to beat it. It wore some kind of camouflage that adjusted to ambient light. Made it nearly invisible in our spectrum.
44) 14) dialog: No one believed him. And then he just... disappeared. Morale of the story:
44) 15) dialog: It hunted and killed his team. One by one. Everybody thinking the same thing:
44) 27) dialog: What makes you think you can fly the ship?
46) 0) text: A form manifests in the foliage. Hanzo, twenty feet off t ground, rests in the crook formed by trunk and limb. Stans is perched on another tree. Edwin, across from him, scrapes moss off the tree onto a leaf. Waiting for dawn. Isabelle clutches the stock of her rifle. Stares out into alien jungle beyond. Her mind elsewhere. Royce. Eyes closed. Asleep. Or so we think. 43.
46) 2) dialog: I won’t make the same mistake with you. Beat.
46) 4) dialog: What happened to you, Royce? What made you so fucked up? He finally opens his eyes. Every word, every syllable of following bought and paid for in full:

Branches RIP like the surface of a lake after a stone throw, the effec spreading into the distance. Until it reaches-- One particular branch, 250 yards out. It doesn’t move. She reacts, startled, opens her mouth-- Royce’s hand wraps around it. Shakes his head. Lets go. Isabelle snaps up the rifle. HER POV: Night vision. The branch is already gone. 44. She shakes her head. Royce points. Deep in jungle, the faintest sense of motion. She tracks it. HER POV: A glimmer. There one moment, gone the next. CLICK, she drops the safety. Others hear it, react, tensi

Rapid shifts to his pursuer. Now forty yards out and closing. Two trains ona collision course. Back to Royce. He angles left. The hunter adjusts accordingly. ISABELLE’S POV: Its form -- still largely unseen -- strob through the bushes. Too fast to draw a bead on. Royce -- he can hear it approaching -- still, he never lo back, never skips a beat -- just hauls ass. Eight yards out... Six... Isabelle’s finger tenses on the trigger HER POV: Four yards... Two... Royce -- the creature almost upon him. Talons -- long, black, jagged -- SLASH! BANG! Thing’s blown off to the side and out of frame. Royce drops to the ground, exhausted. Isabelle lowers the rifle, her expression unreadable.

A scavenger's den. Noland puts down the rifle. As he peels off his Ghillie s

55) 20) dialog: Do you know what I was doing when I was taken? The things I have done? Do you have any idea?
55) 22) dialog: I used to believe that. I used to believe a lot of things. (beat) The trouble with the end justifying the means is that sometimes you get to the end and wonder if it was worth it. And what it was all for. Eyes full of pain.

142) 6) dialog: I didn’t. A thin line of blood wells up on his neck. Nothing more t a paper cut. In his own words:
142) 7) dialog: Very poisonous. Very deadly. All it would take is one scratch. On Edwin, comprehension dawning. And then... The poison from the plant -- still coating the edge of th scalpel -- hits him like a ton of bricks. His core temperature rising. Neurons firing. Brain boiling inside own skull. Blood seeps from his eyes, lips, nose. 92. He SCREAMS. Convulses. Doesn’t go gentle into that good night. All the torment inflicted upon his untold victims is visi upon Edwin ten fold.
