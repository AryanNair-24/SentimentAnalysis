0) 18) dialog: Turn out the light, please. GRADY pauses, studying the wan figure sitting at the back of the classroom, then--reluctantly-hits the switch on th wail, leaving James Leer alone in the DARK.
13) 12) dialog: It's fake. James' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and GRADY  peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. The sliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny PEARL-HANDLED  PISTOL.
13) 13) dialog: It was my mother's. She won it in a penny  arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic  school.
13) 15) dialog: It used to shoot these little paper caps, but  they don't make them anymore. The caps. GRADY reaches for the gun, but James closes his fingers  and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat.
13) 16) dialog: It's just. ..for good luck. Some people carry  rabbits' feet...
13) 18) dialog: No, thank you. I don't like to lose control of  my emotions. GRADY nods, accustomed to James' weirdness.
13) 19) dialog: I'm not supposed to be here, in case you were  wondering. I crashed. I mean, not  intentionally... James nods toward the house, where Hannah Green can be  seen in a window, still fending off the determined Q. JAMES LEER (cont'd)
13) 22) dialog: No! What gave you that idea?
13) 24) dialog: She likes old movies like I do, that's ail. (glancing back at the window) 
13) 27) dialog: You're not like my other teachers, Professor  Tripp.
13) 29) dialog: Huh? Oh. Son or Fury. With Tyrone Power and  Frances Farmer.
13) 31) dialog: So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
13) 33) dialog: (a crooked smile) 
13) 36) dialog: They really hated it. I think they hated it  more than any of the other ones.
13) 38) dialog: It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to  write.
13) 41) dialog: I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in  bed I figure them out. The stories. As James gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse, GRADY  looks down at the left front POCKET of James' overcoat.  Like a nervous tic, James' hand- hidden-twitches against  the modest bulk of the cap gun.
13) 43) dialog: (distant) 
13) 46) dialog: It's colder in there. -
13) 49) dialog: Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought  ...I thought I'd come out here and take a look  at it. You don't see one of those every day. It  looks like heaven...
13) 51) dialog: I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in  heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in  crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the  way I remember it... Abruptly, James glances at his watch.
13) 52) dialog: I should be going. James turns away, then stops. He stands like this a  moment, then turns back. Holds out his right hand. JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
13) 56) dialog: I'll miss my bus.
14) 3) dialog: No, I'm going ho--
14) 12) dialog: George Sanders?
14) 14) dialog: Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel  room. The few people within earshot glance oddly at James, but  Crabtree's eyes glitter with intrigue.
14) 17) dialog: There's so many...
14) 19) dialog: Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles  Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth,  1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an  accident, but, you know. . .  (a trace of irony)
14) 23) dialog: That's just how my brain works, I guess.
14) 25) dialog: Actually. ..I just want to go home.
14) 28) text: GRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway. Just below the photograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN- STRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SAT JACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR.
14) 29) dialog: Is that really it?
14) 31) dialog: The one she wore on her wedding day?
14) 35) dialog: Really?
14) 37) dialog: They're glass. The buttons.
14) 39) dialog: She was small. Most people don't know that.  The shoulders are small. (touching the satin)
14) 41) dialog: It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or...  something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
14) 43) dialog: You're really good friends with the  Chancellor, aren't you? Grady's eyes slide, paranoid, but James' face remains  unchanged, consumed with the jacket.
14) 46) dialog: I guess you must be, if you know the  combination to his closet and he doesn't mind  your being here in their bedroom like this.
14) 49) dialog: I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing  that jacket that belonged to her. It just  looks...really lonely. Hanging there. In a  closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
14) 51) dialog: You mean, with your wife leaving you and ail?  (off Grady's look)
15) 6) dialog: I had to. Didn't I?
15) 8) dialog: No! He was crazy. I didn't-he looked-- 1  thought --
15) 10) dialog: Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see  if someone's breathing.
15) 12) dialog: What are we going to do? GRADY rises awkwardly, holds out his hand.
16) 1) dialog: Professor Tripp? Can I  ask you a question?
16) 3) dialog: What are we going to do with... James glances in the backseat, where Poe lies, strange  blue eyes gleaming.
16) 5) dialog: You?
16) 7) dialog: Does she want to hear it was one of her  professors?
17) 2) dialog: He's still a little warm. They lay him down, push him deep into the trunk--until  there is a SOUND like a pencil SNAPPING.
17) 3) dialog: Yuck. GRADY grabs Crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets.
17) 4) dialog: That's a. big trunk. It fits a tuba, a  suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost  perfectly.
17) 7) dialog: Whose tuba is that anyway? 
17) 9) dialog: Can I ask you something about her?
17) 11) dialog: Oh. So. Is--is your friend Crabtree-- is he-- gay?
17) 15) dialog: No thanks. I'm fine without them.
20) 25) text: He must be finishing. We should go. GRADY looks sadly at Sara then stoops to retrieve his  coat.  As he grabs it, James Leer's little pistol CLATTER to the floor.
21) 0) text: The auditorium doors swing open and James Leer emerges,  arms draped over CRABTREE and a LARGE STUDENT.
21) 1) dialog: Woah! The doors made so much noise! As they make for the restrooms, Sara and GRADY appear.
21) 2) dialog: This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry  me out.
21) 6) dialog: We're going to the men's room. Only we might  not make it in time.
25) 0) text: GRADY parks near a VAN that has KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS  stenciled on the side. He watches a BOUNCER frisk a patro in the PINK LIGHT of the Hi-Hat Club's entrance, then  slides -James Leer's little PISTOL into the glovebox.
27) 0) text: Hannah Green is dancing with a sweat-drenched Q as GRADY  enters this SMOKE-FILLED RHYTHM AND BLUES club. She becko with a finger, but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her  glistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated  shrug and she points. CRABTREE and James Leer sit at a dark corner table. James slouches, eyes half-closed, while CRABTREE stares in the  general vicinity of the dancers, his hand extended beneat the table, in the general vicinity of James' lap. Grady, looking a little alarmed, grabs a passing  WAITRESS.
28) 35) dialog: (sleepily)
28) 36) text: .. .he was killed, when a gangster named  Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite  horse. He took the bullet himself. GRADY and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer, who opens  one bloodshot eye to regard them.
28) 37) dialog: Vernon, over there, was in on the hit. James' eye closes. CRABTREE looks over at Grady.
30) 8) dialog: Mmhmmm.. . . knap ...sap....
30) 14) dialog: (delirious, but insistent) 
38) 0) text: As Traxler drives away, GRADY mounts the porch with James Leer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder. He reaches abo the door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away wi only dust. He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes. H takes the doorknob, turns it. It opens.
41) 0) text: James Leer slumbers on a green sofa, draped in an old  sleeping bag. GRADY drops behind his desk, lets James'  knapsack slide to the floor. He lifts his cuff, inspects  his ugly ankle, then glimpses something in the knapsack. Something yellow. Something soft. GRADY reaches down and, slowly--like a magician producing a magical scarf-extracts MARILYN MONROE'S WEDDING JACKET  from James Leer's ratty green knapsack.  GRADY glances at the young man on his sofa, then, looking very tired, reaches for the desk lamp ...and turns out th light on the both of them.
46) 0) text: GRADY enters with a THERMOS--pauses--redistributes the  sleeping bag over James Leer's pale body.
46) 1) dialog: (without waking) 
46) 6) dialog: I put you on the floor.
46) 8) dialog: I thought you might--l don't know-- swallow  your tongue or something. (nodding to Grady's robe)
46) 11) dialog: I guess there's probably a story behind that.
46) 13) dialog: Want me to get that?
46) 15) dialog: (returning)
46) 18) dialog: The guy on the phone.
46) 20) dialog: He wanted to know if a GRADY Trip? lived here  and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500  with black interior.
46) 22) dialog: Yes.
46) 24) dialog: I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or  something. Is that single-spaced? James has noticed the towering stack of 20 Ib. bond on  Grady's desk.
46) 26) dialog: That's a big book you're writing.
46) 28) dialog: Wow, Hannah always swore you were working,  but--
46) 30) dialog: Nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been  awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some  people--some of the kids in workshop--thought  maybe you were...
46) 32) dialog: Blocked.
46) 34) dialog: No kidding. A LOUD HACKING is HEARD. GRADY and James turn, watch  Crabtree, wearing only a pair of striped boxers,  materialize in the hallway.
46) 38) dialog: Professor Tripp?
46) 40) dialog: How did I get here last night?
46) 42) dialog: And ...and before that. Did I do anything?  Anything bad?
47) 0) text: A POLICEMAN not much older than James Leer waits. As the  door opens, GRADY appears.
49) 20) dialog: What do we do now? #####Before GRADY can reply, .the TELEPHONE sitting on th #####RINGS.
50) 2) dialog: (as the engine roars) 
50) 6) dialog: You're bleeding. Professor Tripp.
51) 3) dialog: I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked  out. I was asked to leave.
51) 5) dialog: There is, but it's not that interesting.
51) 7) dialog: (a long pause) 
51) 9) dialog: It's not -so bad. I know the night janitor.  And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
51) 12) dialog: A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had  the gun. For protection.
51) 14) dialog: Who?
51) 19) dialog: Nice.
53) 1) dialog: (the house) 
53) 5) dialog: I can't help myself. I don't know what's the  matter with me.
55) 1) dialog: She seemed to take it pretty well.
55) 6) dialog: (sharply) 
55) 7) text: No. GRADY looks over, surprised by the James' tone. James  blinks, looks embarrassed. JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
55) 8) text: I mean. I'm fine. I'm sorry. I just... James peers out the window at passing landscape. JAMES LEER (cont'd)
55) 12) dialog: Humboldt County?
55) 15) dialog: It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
55) 17) dialog: Colon cancer.
55) 19) dialog: It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a  small town.
55) 21) dialog: Carvel.
55) 23) dialog: Outside Scranton.
55) 25) dialog: It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin  factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five  years.
55) 27) dialog: Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my morn.  She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before  that, she'd been a dancer.
55) 29) dialog: Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
55) 31) text: James Leer, are you telling me your mother was  a stripper?
55) 32) dialog: I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle.  And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's  clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a  bad debt.
55) 34) dialog: When we fall, we fall hard.
55) 37) dialog: Maybe I just needed the moment to present  itself.
56) 1) dialog: This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy  would live. What's it called again?
56) 3) dialog: Kinship. And what's here?
56) 5) dialog: The one that left you?
57) 1) dialog: Someone jumped on your car with their butt ..-
57) 3) dialog: You can see the outline of a butt. As GRADY nods, James holds out the donut box. JAMES LEER (cont'd)
58) 1) dialog: Maybe she didn't come here.
58) 4) dialog: It's not that. It just reminded me of-- you  know-of what's in the car. In the trunk.
59) 1) dialog: It feels really... good. ..here.
67) 1) dialog: Hullo. FOOTSTEPS are HEARD on the staircase and GRADY hobbies  into view. He tries a smile.
69) 1) dialog: I'm having a really good time, Professor  Tripp. GRADY glances over, sees James burrowing into the Ziploc.
69) 3) dialog: I just wanted a little sip.
69) 6) dialog: Probably about the time you gave me the  codeine pills last night. GRADY stops with the heater, glances over at James, whose face bears not the slightest trace of irony.
69) 9) dialog: You're mad at me, aren't you?
69) 11) dialog: You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's  dog.
69) 15) dialog: Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap  gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking  'I can't let that kid get on. the bus alone-he  might never get on the bus again.' You were  thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract  this kid. ' So you did. It was--in its way--a  noble act.
69) 17) dialog: So, why did you take me up there?
69) 21) dialog: It's warm.
69) 24) dialog: Because of my coat?
69) 26) dialog: (smirking) 
69) 29) dialog: You're lying.
69) 31) dialog: Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You  said so yourself.
69) 33) dialog: Yes you did. Last night. To your friend  Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you  said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
69) 35) dialog: It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard,  the others--they 're right. My stories are  annoying. They go on and on and on, and the  longer they go on the more annoying they  become, until finally you just want to grab  something heavy and--
69) 37) dialog: But, last night...
69) 39) dialog: (quietly) 
69) 43) dialog: Arsonist's Daughter meant something. GRADY smiles contemptuously.
69) 44) dialog: I mean it. It means something to me. It's one  of the reasons I came to school here. To be in  your class. To be taught by you. (quietly)
70) 1) dialog: You coming?
73) 1) dialog: Want a bite?
73) 3) dialog: That's why you're having them. Your spells.
73) 5) dialog: What would you call them then?
73) 7) dialog: It's because you don't eat.
73) 9) dialog: When?
73) 11) dialog: (mouth full, garbled)
73) 14) dialog: Okay. Just then, a long, pale WAND of LIGHT splinters against  the coffee shop windows and a CAR sweeps into the parking lot. GRADY follows it with his eyes, rises. JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
75) 1) dialog: I'm not going with them..
75) 3) dialog: I'm not going, with them.
75) 5) dialog: Parents? They're not my parents. They're my  grandparents. My parents are dead. GRADY stares at-James wearily.
75) 6) dialog: I swear. My father had his own airplane he  used to fly up to Quebec. One Christmas, he and  my mom were flying up to our house in the  Laurentians when the plane went down. It was in  the newspaper. GRADY doesn't flinch, unpersuaded.
75) 7) dialog: I 'swear. My father was a senior vice  president at Dravo. My mother was a socialite.  Her maiden name was Guggenheim. GRADY starts to protest, then pauses.
75) 9) dialog: Six. Their plane went down right outside  Scranton.
75) 12) dialog: I'm sorry about all that. I just-I don't like  to talk about my family. They treat me like a  freak.  (nodding towards Amanda)
75) 15) dialog: There's a reason for that. Grady's addled brain grapples with this dark little  riddle, finally deciphers what James is suggesting.
75) 17) dialog: That's why she hates me. That's why she makes  me sleep in the basement.
75) 19) dialog: I swear.
85) 0) text: The DOOR swings open to reveal James Leer, decked out in  a pair of RED, INK-STAINED PAJAMAS sagging badly in the  seat. He looks like one of Santa's elves.
85) 1) dialog: Hey. What are you guys doing here?
86) 2) dialog: The candelabras were my Gran's.
86) 5) dialog: Can I--I mean--do you mind--if I wear this  again. Professor Tripp?
86) 20) dialog: I'm ready... James stops, sees the two men looking at him.
86) 21) dialog: You all right, Professor Tripp?
86) 23) dialog: Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming  down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of,  check on me. If I'm not here, she might ...call  the police or.. .something.
86) 25) dialog: (brightening)
90) 3) text: Ye-es? GRADY looks down, sees James Leer's black brogues sitting on the floor outside Crabtree's door.
97) 0) text: CRABTREE sits in bed, flipping through the pages of The  Love Parade while stroking a tiny TUFT of HAIR that is th . sole visible part of .James Leer.
97) 5) dialog: (from under the covers) 
97) 6) text: That same guy? CRABTREE peels back the blankets and James Leer opens one eye.
97) 7) dialog: You snore.
97) 9) dialog: (studying Grady)
97) 13) dialog: It's the Chancellor.
97) 16) dialog: I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle. GRADY squints at James as he pulls on his pants.
97) 27) dialog: Does she mean--does she know about ...her dog?
97) 30) dialog: Thank you.
98) 3) dialog: I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you.  Professor Tripp?
98) 5) dialog: Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I  probably should be expelled.
98) 7) dialog: Professor Tripp...?
98) 9) dialog: Even if I end up going to jail.... James smiles his crooked grin. JAMES LEER (cont'd)
103) 0) text: GRADY peers into the backseat, squinting against the WIND that swirls around him. Errol Flynn's face leers back at  him. But no jacket. GRADY slides in, pops the glove box,  and frowns at the ZIPLOC of Humboldt County. He pockets i anyway, then spies something else. James Leer's little PEARL-HANDLED PISTOL. GRADY takes it, rotates it-in his palm. SUNLIGHT GLINTS  off the chrome barrel and everything slowly turns to a  SWEET, SOFT BLUR...
109) 0) text: Grady, James Leer's hollow knapsack in hand, stands with  CRABTREE at the campus entrance as Vernon and Oola prepar to leave in the Galaxie.
111) 0) text: GRADY surveys the room. Empty chairs. Empty desks. He walks to a WINDOW, the same window he stood at two  afternoons ago when reading James Leer's story. A chill  breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the  barren benches and icy walkways of the quad. Finally, he- turns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into hi pocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his  manuscript. He considers them, then folds them in half  length-wise. He continues, folding the top right corner  down into a triangle along the first crease...
126) 0) text: The snow continues to fall as GRADY lumbers down the  street. Finally, wearily, he stops, sits his crippled sel on the curb. He plunges his fist into his jacket and.  ..straight through the lining, James Leer's silly little  pistol at the end of his hand. He considers the pistol,  then looks up into the sky. GRADY'S POV - of the SKY...  ...dark and menacing. Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shatters  the silence. NEW ANGLE - GRADY ...still sitting with the gun in his  hand.
