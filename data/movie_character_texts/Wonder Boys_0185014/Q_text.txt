12) 8) dialog: And while my latest has been on the New York  Times bestseller list for 40 weeks, I can't  help but lament that my first book, which  contains what I consider my finest writing, was  remaindered in less than five. So, I find  myself conflicted.

12) 15) text: A supermarket for the mind, my ass. I'm  telling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob  laundry. Have you ever been to Davenport, Iowa?  Let me tell you, they need a 30,000-square-foot  bookstore like they need another goddamn cow. (as GRADY passes)

Finally,  she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off,  returning to the clamor inside her house. GRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of  LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watchi him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's  garage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught  eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the  porch.

What is the bridge, the  bridge that allows you to walk on air from the  shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of  accomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is  worth the telling, faith that you have the  wherewithal to tell it, faith that the  carefully woven structure you create won't  collapse beneath you...

18) 6) text: ...and faith that when you get to the other  side someone will be waiting who gives a damn  about the tale you have to tell.

Abruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement:  bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the auditorium. As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn, James ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows away, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady. GRADY blinks, turns to James.

James slouches, eyes half-closed, while CRABTREE stares in the  general vicinity of the dancers, his hand extended beneat the table, in the general vicinity of James' lap.

46) 37) text: If-you 're planning on staying for breakfast,  I'd put on something a little less comfortable  if I were you. As GRADY moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the page curling from the typewriter, James continues to star into the emptiness of the hallway. The sight of CRABTREE  seems to have made him suddenly queasy.
51) 16) text: Me. GRADY drops the basket at the check-out counter and,  abruptly, finds himself face to face with a BABY, lolling on the shoulder of the woman before him. The baby is  staring, spellbound, at a display of...Q'S LATEST

GRADY blinks, looks away, and DIALS, just as. ..the  CLATTERING COUGH of an ENGINE is HEARD and a VAN appears. Stenciled on its side panel is: Kravnik's Sporting Goods The van slows, almost coasting, then abruptly bursts past Grady's house and disappears around the corner.

A chill  breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the  barren benches and icy walkways of the quad. Finally, he- turns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into hi pocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his  manuscript. He considers them, then folds them in half  length-wise. He continues, folding the top right corner  down into a triangle along the first crease...
