As he finishes, GRADY ponders a PAIR of MAINTENANCE MEN,  perched on ladders in the quad below, stringing a LARGE  BANNER between two bare trees. The BANNER reads:

1) 3) text: It's all right, Elliot. I'll take care of it. GRADY watches Sara take the programs, turn, and spot him. There is the slightest of hesitations, then....
1) 5) dialog: Chancellor.

5) 2) dialog: How are you, Crabtree?
5) 6) dialog: (a slight beat) 
5) 10) dialog: I sweat blood for five years and he checks for  spelling.
5) 15) dialog: Emily?

6) 6) dialog: She's still a transvestite.
6) 8) dialog: Isn't she? Crabtree ignores Grady's question, smiling placidly as he watches the carousel spin.
6) 10) dialog: It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort  of. ..tinkering with it.
6) 12) dialog: I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical. . .  juncture .
6) 14) dialog: I just mean. . .

8) 2) text: This is Tanya. My wife's secretary. CRABTREE and MISS SLOVIAK smile and nod. Tanya smiles and nods back, her eyes passing uneasily over Grady's joint.
8) 4) text: Is there anything I can do for you? GRADY watches a tiny stream of water trickle through  Tanya's sad umbrella.

MISS SLOVIAK notices a  GREENHOUSE, shimmering quietly in the chill night air.

11) 0) text: GRADY enters a room swimming in BASEBAIL MEMORABILIA.  AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALLS abound, as well as PHOTOGRAPHS of  famous big-leaguers. In one somewhat-dated PHOTO a TRIM M IN HIS FORTIES (a younger Walter Gaskell) stands with  PITTSBURGH PIRATE BILL MAZEROSKI at an old-timers game. A Sara eases the door shut, GRADY nods to a 1951 YANKEE'S  PENNANT hanging over the mantle.
11) 1) dialog: New?
11) 3) text: Walter just got it back from the framer today. Sara takes Grady's hand, drawing him away from the  pennant and down onto the coat-covered bed.
11) 5) dialog: All right. This morning--
11) 8) dialog: Well. This is...surprising. Does Walter... ?
11) 10) dialog: Emily left me this morning.
11) 12) dialog: She's left the room before. She always came  back. Sara nods. Considers this.
11) 14) dialog: Simple. GRADY and Sara stare at the ceiling. Sara sniffs the coat lying beneath her. Miss Sloviak's coat.
11) 16) dialog: Hm.
11) 19) dialog: If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is  by the end of the evening.
11) 21) dialog: Yes.
11) 23) dialog: No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm  going to do.
11) 25) text: Neither do 1. GRADY starts to pull up, but his arm is underneath Sara.
11) 26) dialog: Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
12) 7) text: GRADY works his way through the crowd, spies Walter, and  changes course. Directly ahead is an oddly commanding MAN ("Q"). From the behavior of the people in his vicinity it clear he is someone of interest. Presently, he is putting the make on Hannah Green.
12) 9) dialog: Ask him if he's conflicted about his house in  the Hamptons.
12) 11) text: Grady. Q eyes GRADY over his wine glass.
12) 13) dialog: Q,. Hannah's had two stories published in The  Paris Review. You'd best dust off the 'A'  material for her. As GRADY moves off, he sees Poe sniffing, and goes the  other way, heading directly into the crosshairs of a MAH TWEED, who is talking to another, shorter MAN.
12) 15) text: A supermarket for the mind, my ass. I'm  telling you, they're nothing but a big, fat mob  laundry. Have you ever been to Davenport, Iowa?  Let me tell you, they need a 30,000-square-foot  bookstore like they need another goddamn cow. (as GRADY passes) 
12) 16) text: Grady!
12) 17) dialog: Hello, Nathan.

13) 0) text: GRADY comes out the back: door and ferrets a JOINT from  his pocket, lights it. He takes a long draw, walks around the side of the house. As he passes a window, a VOICE  accosts him.
13) 10) text: I'm happy. As Walter goes, GRADY studies Sara as she stands alone in the quiet little room, looking small and tired. Finally,  she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off,  returning to the clamor inside her house. GRADY sighs, guilt-stricken, then detects a FLICKER of  LIGHT coming from the darkness beyond. A FIGURE is watchi him from the retaining wail that leads to the Gaskell's  garage. GRADY blinks, chagrined that he's been caught  eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the  porch.
13) 11) dialog: James? James Leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a  GREEN KNAPSACK hanging off one shoulder. GRADY looks at  what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in James' palm.
13) 14) dialog: It's very convincing.
13) 17) dialog: ...You carry firearms. As GRADY exhales a plume of smoke, James' eyes pass  briefly over the jay. GRADY notices, offers.
13) 20) text: ...but the other night, Hannah and I were  together, at the movies, and she asked me.  Since she was coming. So I ended up coming.  Too. GRADY nods, ponders this over-elaborate explanation.
13) 21) dialog: Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James ?
13) 23) dialog: Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent  her a room.
13) 26) dialog: Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she  knows it and try as she might to not let that  screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in  some way. James looks away from the window, at Grady.
13) 28) dialog: You're not like my other students, James. So  what was the movie you two saw?
13) 30) dialog: She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
13) 32) dialog: Sounds like a good one.
13) 34) text: It's not bad. GRADY considers James' fragile face.
13) 35) dialog: Listen, James, about this afternoon. In  workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a  bit out of control.
13) 37) dialog: Well...
13) 39) dialog: (truly impressed) 
13) 42) dialog: You cold, James?
13) 45) dialog: So what are you doing out here?
13) 47) dialog: (laughing) 
13) 48) text: You're right. James blinks, startled by Grady's laughter, startled that he's said something funny. He looks back to the greenhous
13) 50) dialog: Heaven?
13) 53) text: Goodbye, Professor Tripp. GRADY hesitates, then shakes James' hand. James moves off then, leaving the light of the house behind.
13) 54) dialog: James.  (as he stops)
13) 57) dialog: This is worth it. James looks conflicted. GRADY (cont'd) 
14) 0) text: It's quieter now, the party winding down, as GRADY sneaks the departing guests and toward the stairs.        
14) 4) dialog: He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his  friend. All right?
14) 6) dialog: The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know.  Where are they exactly?
14) 10) dialog: James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
14) 28) text: GRADY and James Leer stand in the doorway. Just below the photograph of Marilyn and Joe--hanging next to a PIN- STRIPED JERSEY bearing the number 5--is a SHORT BLACK SAT JACKET trimmed with an ERMINE COLLAR.
14) 30) dialog: That's really it.
14) 32) dialog: So I'm told. James, in the presence of the holy grail of suicide  garments, stands speechless.
14) 33) dialog: (cont'd) 
14) 36) dialog: Really. James swallows, then'-goes to the jacket. Carefully, he  reaches out his fingers and touches the yellowed collar,  barely making contact, as though it might crumble to dust
14) 38) dialog: Like the lady herself. GRADY says this airily, ironically, riding his buzz a  bit, but James nods solemnly, eyes transfixed on the  jacket, as if Marilyn herself were inside it.
14) 40) text: It looks so perfect. I bet it's the only time  she wore it. That day. She must've felt so  ...happy. GRADY studies James as he takes the fringe of the jacket, lifts it lightly.
14) 42) dialog: I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth  about how much he pays for these things.
14) 44) dialog: (carefully)
14) 47) dialog: Right. A DOOR SLAMS downstairs and GRADY and James jump. The  CLICK of a woman's HIGH HEELS sends GRADY to the bedroom  window, where he watches Sara slide into a WHITE CITROEN  DS23, turn on the ignition, and motor away.
14) 48) dialog: We, better skedaddle. Close that closet--  James? You ail right? James is slumped on the Gaskell's white linen bed,  knapsack between his knees, head in hands.
14) 50) dialog: Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself  tonight.
14) 53) dialog: Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we  should go now. Without thinking, GRADY flicks out the bedroom light,  leaving James Leer in the dark for the second time today. James just sits there, a shadow in a room of shadows.
15) 0) text: A LOW RUMBLE freezes GRADY as he enters the hail. A few feet away, Poe lies belly to the ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in Grady's direction.
15) 1) dialog: Okay. Easy now. Eee-zy. . . . GRADY starts to take a step, when.... Poe shoots forward  and sinks himself deep into Grady's ankle.
15) 2) dialog: Jesus! GRADY hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting Poe off the  ground as he swings his leg up. Poe, countering, rolls hi head in a snapping motion and drops GRADY in a clumsy hea
15) 3) dialog: Get off of me, you son-of-a-bitch! Poe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his  head back and forth, back and forth, over and over,  growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his  throat, until there is a sharp...
15) 5) dialog: Shit, James. You shoe Dr. Gaskell's dog.
15) 7) dialog: Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
15) 9) dialog: Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on  me. GRADY roils down his sock. Apparently, Poe went through  life with a slight overbite.
15) 11) dialog: He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead  dog when I see one. James looks miserably at Poe.
15) 13) dialog: First you're going to give me that little cap  gun of yours.
16) 0) text: GRADY and James stare gloomily out the windshield.
16) 2) dialog: Yea, James.
16) 4) dialog: I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out  how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her  husband's dog.
16) 6) dialog: Trust me, James, when the family pet's been  assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear  one of her students was the triggerman.
16) 8) dialog: I've got tenure.
17) 0) text: As sporadic APPLAUSE wafts from the high windowpanes of  Thaw Hall, GRADY leans into the Galaxie's trunk, creates space between the tuba and a ZIPPERED SUITCASE.
17) 1) dialog: Okay. James totters forward, arms hooked under Poe's front legs looking like a sorry marathon dancer. GRADY frowns, limps forward, and takes the hind legs.
17) 5) dialog: (searching)
17) 8) dialog: Miss Sloviak's.
17) 10) dialog: She is. Ah. Here we go... GRADY unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane- size bottle of JACK DANIELS, then grabs another pair of  boxers.
17) 12) dialog: Most of the time he is, James. Some of the  time he isn't. Now what do we have here? GRADY rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a  pair of WHITE PILLS, each etched with a tiny numeral 3.
17) 13) dialog: Looks like ...our old friend Mr. Codeine. That  should take the pinch out of my ankle. (handing the bottle to James) 
17) 16) dialog: Right. That's why you were standing in the  Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap  gun of yours tonight.  You're fine, all right,  you're fit as a fucking fiddle. GRADY opens the tiny bottle of Jack with his teeth,  drinks down two number 3's, then looks at James.
17) 17) dialog: I'm sorry, James. I'm sorry I said that. Recklessly, James takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth,  and tips back the tiny bottle of Jack. Half a second late he spits it all out. GRADY looks down, peels the soggy pi from the lapel of his jacket.
17) 18) dialog: How 'bout we try that again.
18) 5) text: As a writer, one thing you learn is that  everyone you encounter has a story. Every  bartender, every taxi driver, everybody has an  idea or a. story that would make a "great book"  or a "great movie." Presumably, each of you has  an idea. (gestures to the audience) But, how do you go from there to here? How do  you go from having an idea to having a book?  How do you get across? What is the bridge, the  bridge that allows you to walk on air from the  shoreline of inspiration to the terra firma of  accomplishment? Faith. Faith that your story is  worth the telling, faith that you have the  wherewithal to tell it, faith that the  carefully woven structure you create won't  collapse beneath you... GRADY glances at James, sees that his eyes are unblinking and glazed, then sees, beyond him, Sara standing by the f EXIT. A blink later, she is gone. Q (cont'd)
18) 6) text: ...and faith that when you get to the other  side someone will be waiting who gives a damn  about the tale you have to tell. GRADY leans back, listening to the BEATING of his own  HEART, the soft GLIMMER of the chandeliers hanging by a  thread forty feet above his head... Abruptly, James LAUGHS OUT LOUD--some private amusement:  bubbling up from the bottom or his brain and out into the auditorium. As Q looks and four hundred other heads turn, James ducks down--mortified. Crabtree, sitting a few rows away, studies James with amusement, then winks at Grady. GRADY blinks, turns to James.
18) 7) dialog: I'll be right back.
19) 0) text: GRADY bursts through the auditorium doors and into the  lobby. A PAIR. of local BOOKSELLERS, chatting quietly  behind a table arrayed with the BOOKS of attending author glance up as GRADY limps toward the restrooms. 
20) 0) text: GRADY stumbles down the sloping carper, but the corridor  begins to turn sideways on him and he stops, resting his  cheek against the cool...cool...wall. ..as...ail..-goes..
20) 5) dialog: Is the thing-is it over?
20) 8) dialog: Nothing. I think I twisted my-- GRADY looks at his ankle and feels a rush of guilt.
20) 9) dialog: I have to tell you something. Something..  .hard. Sara's face stiffens, becomes more Chancelloresque.
20) 11) dialog: Well...
20) 13) dialog: No, really, Sara, I don't think you--
20) 15) dialog: I don't think I really have a choice in, that.  Emily left me.
20) 17) dialog: Not have it.
20) 19) dialog: Well, no, I don't see any way. (taking her hand)
20) 23) text: ...for saying there's just no way. Because  there could be a way, Grady. Somewhere deep in the building, APPLAUSE swells.
20) 25) text: He must be finishing. We should go. GRADY looks sadly at Sara then stoops to retrieve his  coat.  As he grabs it, James Leer's little pistol CLATTER to the floor.
20) 27) dialog: It's-it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore. Before GRADY can close his hand, Sara has it in her own.
20) 29) dialog: Caps. She points it-at Grady's chest. He smiles nervously.
20) 31) dialog: You got me.
20) 33) dialog: I love you, too.
21) 3) dialog: Is he ail right?
21) 9) dialog: I'm your man.
22) 1) dialog: There's an explanation. MISS SLOVIAK raises an eyebrow and then, leaning in,  unzips her suitcase.
23) 0) text: As GRADY drives, MISS SLOVIAK finishes with the top  button of a man's shirt, then reaches into the zippered  COSMETICS BAG in her lap. Onto the open tray of the  glovebox, she places a JAR of COLD CREAM, a BOTTLE of NAI POLISH REMOVER, and a cloud of COTTON BALLS.
23) 2) dialog: James is. ..I don't know...
23) 4) dialog: I'm not sure that's possible.
23) 6) dialog: Listen, Antonia--
23) 8) dialog: Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so  well for you tonight. With Terry.
23) 10) dialog: He's writing his name in water.
23) 12) dialog: Like most editors, he really wants to be a  writer, but he's too busy living a novel to  bother writing one.
23) 14) dialog: He'd call it habit. But now. ..I get the  feeling he's going through the motions a bit. Tony peels off a pair of false eyelashes, blinks.
23) 16) dialog: Jesus. Is that what he told you?
24) 0) text: GRADY pulls in front of a small brick house. On the front lawn, a small statue of the BLESSED VIRGIN stands under a little white BAND SHELL painted with stars.
24) 1) dialog: That'' s nice. All we have is a Japanese  beetle trap.
24) 4) text: Let me see it. The gun. GRADY reaches into his pocket, hands it over. Tony  smirks.
24) 6) dialog: I'd better go. I think I may have to rescue  James Leer. MISS SLOVIAK returns the gun, .steps out of the car, and  peers in at Grady.
25) 0) text: GRADY parks near a VAN that has KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS  stenciled on the side. He watches a BOUNCER frisk a patro in the PINK LIGHT of the Hi-Hat Club's entrance, then  slides -James Leer's little PISTOL into the glovebox.
26) 0) text: As GRADY steps to the door, the bouncer gives him a  perfunctory pat-down.
26) 3) dialog: As a whistle.
27) 0) text: Hannah Green is dancing with a sweat-drenched Q as GRADY  enters this SMOKE-FILLED RHYTHM AND BLUES club. She becko with a finger, but Grady--Nervous at the sight of her  glistening Mormon skin--merely pantomimes an exaggerated  shrug and she points. CRABTREE and James Leer sit at a dark corner table. James slouches, eyes half-closed, while CRABTREE stares in the  general vicinity of the dancers, his hand extended beneat the table, in the general vicinity of James' lap. Grady, looking a little alarmed, grabs a passing  WAITRESS.
27) 1) dialog: Double Dickel on the rocks.
28) 0) text: As GRADY arrives, CRABTREE withdraws his hand delicately  and James' eyes flutter open .briefly, ..then close.
28) 1) dialog: Is that just beer?
28) 3) dialog: I'm sure. Where is everyone?
28) 5) dialog: Jesus. He's out. CRABTREE glances over, nods.
28) 7) dialog: I know. He started it Fall semester.
28) 10) dialog: No. Not yet he isn't.
28) 12) dialog: Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's . one oВЈ  my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure  if he's-
28) 14) dialog: I think it's more complicated than that.  Besides, he's a little...scattered. He almost  ...did something stupid tonight. At least, I  think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual  confusion thrown into the stew right now.
28) 18) dialog: Thanks. GRADY notices the waitress's nametag (OOLA) and realizes  she is conspicuously PREGNANT. He watches her disappear  beyond the blur of bodies on the dancefloor, where Hannah Green's slinky form seizes his attention.
28) 20) dialog: Shut up and drink. CRABTREE grins, brings his bottle up, then stops.
28) 22) dialog: President of the James Brown Hair Club For  Men. Sitting alone in the dark booth is a SMALL BLACK MAN with big hands, a face peppered with scar tissue, and--most  noticeably--a tsunami of hair sprouting from his scalp.
28) 23) dialog: (initiating an old game) 
28) 26) dialog: Not Curtis.
28) 28) dialog: And now he's addicted to painkillers.
28) 30) dialog: He lives with his mother.
28) 32) dialog: Groom. Named Claudell.  And his mother blames  Vernon for his death.
28) 36) text: .. .he was killed, when a gangster named  Freddie Nostrils tried to shoot his favorite  horse. He took the bullet himself. GRADY and Crabtree turn to look at James Leer, who opens  one bloodshot eye to regard them.
28) 39) dialog: He heard everything we were saying. Just then, Hannah Green bounces up in her red boots.
29) 0) text: GRADY and Hannah, reflected in bits and pieces in the  jack 'o lantern wail of MIRRORED TILE, slow-dance to a  sexy, measured blues.
29) 2) dialog: I thank you.
29) 4) dialog: I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy  innocents we can get. GRADY spies the corner table, watches CRABTREE say  something to Q and then, casually, stroke a lock of hair  from James Leer's forehead.
29) 6) dialog: Do?
29) 8) dialog: Are you holding me up or am I dragging you  down? Hannah snuggles closer, lays her head on Grady's chest.
30) 0) text: Grady, limping on his bad ankle, carries James to  Hannah's rumpled RENAULT, props him against the fender.
30) 1) dialog: Look, Hannah. When you get him home ...make  sure he's ail right. Before you leave. Okay?
30) 3) dialog: Hannah, are you telling me you don't know  where James Leer lives?
30) 5) dialog: That strikes me as odd.
30) 9) dialog: What's he saying?
30) 11) dialog: Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was... GRADY glances at the idling Galaxie across the street. 
30) 13) dialog: Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the  auditorium.
30) 15) text: Mmrrmmm.. .KNAP SAP! GRADY frowns in annoyance, opens the passenger door. GRADY (cont'd)
30) 18) dialog: I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We  could probably stand him up in the garage with  the snow shovels at this point. As GRADY lowers James into the seat, he WHIMPERS, curls  into a bail. Hannah turns her puppy dog eyes on Grady.
30) 19) dialog: Ail right. In my office. As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah's fingers graze his  face.
30) 22) dialog: Excuse me?
30) 24) dialog: It's mine.
30) 26) dialog: You must be mistaken.
30) 28) dialog: Go home to your mother, Vernon.

31) 1) dialog: All right, what's the matter? CRABTREE just keeps smiling.
31) 2) dialog: Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do?  The kid's practically in a coma.
31) 4) dialog: Yes.
31) 8) dialog: What's this guy's problem?
31) 10) dialog: Shit.

33) 2) text: Hey, Professor Tripp.  (off Grady's look)
33) 4) dialog: I hope it wasn't my fault.
33) 7) dialog: Oh.. .yeah.

36) 0) text: Traxler gives GRADY a ride in his Honda, one of the  original Hondas best suited for sidewalk driving. The  backseat bulges with a huge AMPLIFIER and BASS GUITAR.
36) 2) dialog: Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
36) 4) dialog: Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub  ail kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground  lamb.
37) 2) dialog: No, my wife's out of town. Just then, the Honda FILLS WITH LIGHT. HEADLIGHTS loom,  then a POLICE CAR sweeps into the Gaskell's driveway.  Walter appears on the front steps. TRAXLER (cont'd) 
37) 4) dialog: Her husband. Traxler looks anxiously at the police car.
37) 6) dialog: (staring at Sara) 
38) 0) text: As Traxler drives away, GRADY mounts the porch with James Leer's knapsack hanging from one shoulder. He reaches abo the door, feeling for a key, but his fingers come away wi only dust. He stands, dispirited, then an idea strikes. H takes the doorknob, turns it. It opens.
39) 0) text: GRADY enters, closes the door quietly behind him.
40) 0) text: The room is dim but the TV is on, throwing crazy slashes  of light onto the wails and ceiling. As GRADY limps by, h finds a sleeping Hannah Green, bundled in a blanket, T- shirt, and little else. On the floor, near her dangling  hand, Woolf's A Common Reader lays open next to a Diet  Coke. GRADY considers the smooth geography of her body, b his eyes 'are most powerfully drawn to. ..her feet. He  steps forward, lifts the blanket gently, but finds-to his disappointment--only the red cowboy boots. He picks up the remote, turns off the TV, and exits.
41) 0) text: James Leer slumbers on a green sofa, draped in an old  sleeping bag. GRADY drops behind his desk, lets James'  knapsack slide to the floor. He lifts his cuff, inspects  his ugly ankle, then glimpses something in the knapsack. Something yellow. Something soft. GRADY reaches down and, slowly--like a magician producing a magical scarf-extracts MARILYN MONROE'S WEDDING JACKET  from James Leer's ratty green knapsack.  GRADY glances at the young man on his sofa, then, looking very tired, reaches for the desk lamp ...and turns out th light on the both of them.
42) 0) text: GRADY steps outside in a WOMAN'S CHENILLE BATHROBE and  plucks the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette from the second porch  step. He fishes out a charred ROACH, starts to light it,  then notices the Galaxie sitting in the driveway.

45) 0) text: GRADY pushes open the door with the tips of his fingers,  lets it glide open. The room that is revealed is bright a well-ordered, in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of  Grady's office. There is a DRAFTING TABLE and a COMPUTER, pads and pens neatly arranged alongside. A BULLITEN BOARD hangs on one wall, bearing an intricate  mosaic of multi-colored index cards. There are PRINTS,  framed, from various art exhibits, and two of Grady's  DHSTJACKETS--including, most prominently, Arsonist's  Daughter. There are PHOTOGRAPHS of EMILY too. In a black turtleneck with friends. In a sundress with Grady. In a billowing  Burberry, floating like a dark butterfly against a BLUR o YELLOW TAXIS on a street in Manhattan. Smiling brilliantly. Beautiful.
46) 0) text: GRADY enters with a THERMOS--pauses--redistributes the  sleeping bag over James Leer's pale body.
46) 3) dialog: You're welcome. GRADY sits at his desk, pours himself a cup of coffee  from the thermos, then sets the cup directly in the cente of a galaxy of previous coffee rings. Next, he takes a  clean piece of paper, balls it up, and-with ritual  precision-strokes it into the MINIATURE BASKETBALL HOOP  that crowns the rim of the WASTE BASKET across the room. All net. A 9-VOLT CROWD ROAR belches from the hoop and, without  further ceremony, GRADY turns to the blank page curling from his IBM SELECTRIC  and SPACES to the top right corner, TYPES: (beat) 2611 In other words: Page 2611. CLOSE UP - THE TYPEWRITER PAPER -- darkening with WORDS,  the KEYS SNAPPING faster and faster, a CRAZY CLAMOR that  grows and grows until, finally, it just ....Stops.
46) 4) dialog: James I   GRADY awakes with his back to the floor, James leer's  quizzical face floating like a cloud above him.
46) 5) dialog: I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
46) 7) dialog: Oh.
46) 9) text: I guess you really miss her, huh? GRADY peers down at the geraniums blooming on the pockets of the robe, its overall fuzziness.
46) 10) dialog: Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write  in it.
46) 12) dialog: There is, but it's not that interesting. James nods. Down the hallway, in another room, the  TELEPHONE RINGS.
46) 14) dialog: Sure. As James shuffles away in the sleeping bag, GRADY rises  delicately and turns toward the window, ..just in time to see a POLICE CAR roil slowly by on the screen below.
46) 17) dialog: Who?
46) 19) dialog: What'd he say?
46) 21) dialog: What'd you tell him?
46) 23) dialog: Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be  sure to mention the back door pops open with a  couple hard shakes to the right.
46) 25) dialog: Afraid so.
46) 27) dialog: I think it's sort of writing itself at this  point.
46) 29) dialog: But . . . ?
46) 31) dialog: Washed up?
46) 33) dialog: Ah. I don't believe in writer's block. James takes another glance at the mammoth manuscript.
46) 36) dialog: (re: James' "attire") 
46) 37) text: If-you 're planning on staying for breakfast,  I'd put on something a little less comfortable  if I were you. As GRADY moves to his desk to reacquaint himself with the page curling from the typewriter, James continues to star into the emptiness of the hallway. The sight of CRABTREE  seems to have made him suddenly queasy.
46) 39) dialog: Hm.
46) 41) dialog: No one seems to know where you live, James.  Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
46) 43) dialog: Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the  English Department's dog and steal his most  prized piece of memorabilia. As James contemplates this, the DOORBELL RINGS. GRADY  looks up, sees the POLICE CAR he noticed earlier, now  parked at the bottom of his driveway.
46) 44) dialog: Do yourself a favor, James ...Hide.
47) 0) text: A POLICEMAN not much older than James Leer waits. As the  door opens, GRADY appears.
49) 0) text: GRADY is  scratching his head in mock thought.
49) 1) dialog: Well, there's always people you don't know at  these things, but I can't say there was anybody  particularly suspicious. ..Wait. There was one  guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
49) 3) dialog: Horses, right. Vernon something... (thinking... )
49) 6) dialog: I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
49) 8) dialog: That's weird.
49) 10) dialog: The perpetrator.
49) 12) dialog: Just kidding. Pupcik nods slowly, as if re-filing GRADY under "Dealing  With Assholes."
49) 14) dialog: I might have his number on campus.
49) 18) dialog: Oh. Well. I... Hannah stretches and the t-shirt slides dangerously up  her thighs.
49) 21) dialog: Hello?
49) 23) dialog: Could you hold on a minute, honey? With a look of wonderment, GRADY watches his hand ever- so- gently ...hang up the phone.
49) 24) dialog: How 'bout we get the hell out of here?
50) 0) text: James, now wearing one of Grady's flannel shirts beneath  his ratty overcoat, follows Grady-to the Galaxie, knapsac swinging from his shoulder. GRADY tosses him a ring of  KEYS.
50) 1) dialog: You start her up. As GRADY runs a plastic WEDGE over the GLAZE of ice  blanketing the windshield, James stares curiously at the  keys, as if they were some strange artifact, then slides  behind the steering wheel.
50) 4) dialog: Well done, James. As GRADY works, James' face comes into view, then ...the  wedge SNAPS, splintering into the flesh of Grady's hand. GRADY (cont'd) 
51) 0) text: GRADY and James stand in the sundries aisle of a  neighborhood MARKET. GRADY has a TIN of BAND-AIDS open and is presently plastering  his ragged thumb.
51) 1) dialog: Where exactly do you live, James? James, in the midst of chugging from a 64-OUNCE JUG of  ORANGE JUICE, stops.
51) 2) dialog: Apparently not even Hannah Green has a clue as  to the location of your apartment. GRADY tosses the tin of band-aids into a small plastic  hand basket, begins to move down the aisle.
51) 4) dialog: I guess there's probably a story behind that.
51) 6) dialog: So where have you been staying?
51) 8) text: The bus station. GRADY stares incredulously at James.
51) 10) dialog: (trying to fathom this) 
51) 13) dialog: Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
51) 15) dialog: I don't know... (unconvincingly)
51) 16) text: Me. GRADY drops the basket at the check-out counter and,  abruptly, finds himself face to face with a BABY, lolling on the shoulder of the woman before him. The baby is  staring, spellbound, at a display of...Q'S LATEST 
52) 0) text: Grady, squinting through the ten-inch panel of cleared  ice on the windshield, roils slowly up onto the curb in  front of Walter and Sara Gaskell's house ...then off.
53) 0) text: GRADY pops the glovebox, takes out a PEN, and scratches  something on the GIFT CARD attached to the BALLOON. James glances briefly at a plump ZIPLOC OF POT stashed in the  glovebox, then peers at the house.
53) 3) dialog: Hm. GRADY gets out, then pauses, glancing at the giant orange juice jug between James legs. It's about half-down.
53) 4) dialog: You better ease off that stuff, James. It's  pretty acidic. James takes a powdered donut that lies on his coat,  studies it curiously.
53) 6) dialog: Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you  think's the matter with you? As GRADY turns away, James ponders this, then considers  the ring of white sugar imprinted on his coat and re-sets the donut in precisely the same place.
54) 0) text: Through the steamy panes, we SEE GRADY approach with the  balloon, enter. He crosses to a high table, sets the  balloon down, and steps back, considering the placement.
54) 3) dialog: Totally.  I'm sorry. A lot was happening this  morning. Can you talk? Sara nods, moves the ficus to another table.
54) 5) dialog: I-heard.
54) 7) dialog: A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house  this morning.
54) 10) dialog: Really? That was fast.
54) 13) dialog: Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There  is something I need to tell...
54) 15) dialog: Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to .  . .
54) 17) dialog: No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I  don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell  you something.
54) 19) dialog: 
54) 23) dialog: Really, Sara, I... Sara holds up one gloved hand.
54) 25) dialog: I know that. I know what's at stake here...
54) 27) dialog: About the baby.
54) 31) dialog: James Leer.
54) 33) dialog: I'm sort of helping him work through some  issues. Sara raises an eyebrow, then pushes through the door.
55) 2) dialog: Yeah, well, actually. . . James looks over. GRADY (cont'd) 
55) 3) text: The moment didn't really present itself. James nods, unsurprised, then turns back to the window,  staring at the landscape, still sitting oddly still. GRAD glances at him. At the orange juice jug. GRADY (cont'd)
55) 5) dialog: Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley  Heights. We could find you a nice golf course  to barf on.
55) 7) text: No. GRADY looks over, surprised by the James' tone. James  blinks, looks embarrassed. JAMES LEER (cont'd) 
55) 10) dialog: Your aunt ? James turns, eyes flashing with surprise. GRADY (cont'd)
55) 13) dialog: (surprised)
55) 16) dialog: Glaucoma?
55) 18) dialog: Jesus, James. Wow. James puts the joint back in the ashtray.
55) 20) dialog: Where's that?
55) 22) dialog: Carvel? Where's Carvel?
55) 24) dialog: I never heard of it.
55) 26) dialog: Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
55) 28) dialog: What kind of dancer? .
55) 30) dialog: (in disbelief)
55) 33) dialog: Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic  school?
55) 35) dialog: Amazing. GRADY takes the joint from the ashtray, lights it, then  notices-with surprise--James has his hand out. GRADY (cont'd) 
56) 0) text: GRADY glides down the graceful, tree-lined streets of a  modest, but well-kept neighborhood. James still has the  JOINT-now only a tiny nub-pinched between his fingers.
56) 2) dialog: Kinship.
56) 4) dialog: Unless I miss my bet...my wife. James' heavy eyelids flutter with surprise.
56) 6) dialog: That's right. That one.
57) 0) text: GRADY RAPS on the front door, then cups his hands against the glass of the living room window, squints inside.  Nothing. As he turns away, GRADY sees James sitting on th hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts. He's sitting in the indentation.
57) 2) dialog: How can you tell?
57) 5) dialog: Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you  can start on the box.
58) 0) text: As GRADY steps onto the back porch, James follows.
58) 2) dialog: She came here. We'll just wait. In the  meantime, I need you to shimmy through. James stares at the "Doggy Door" cut into the back porch  door.
58) 3) dialog: Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since  she was twelve years old. And your hips are as  slim as hers.
58) 5) dialog: (a pang of guilt himself)
59) 0) text: GRADY leads James through the house. Everything about it  speaks of family. Even the furniture seems arranged so th people will gather together, light a fire, talk.
59) 2) dialog: I know. It's the house you want to wake up in  on Christmas morning. (moving off)
60) 0) text: Grady, laboring badly on his ankle", enters and finds a  DUFFEL BAG open on the floor, its contents a tangle of  quickly-packed clothes. Everything else in the room feels of another time. PHOTOGRAPHS are everywhere, documenting PRETTY GIRL'S life, from first recital to cap and gown. One photograph lies face down. GRADY turns it over and  finds the pretty girl grown into a beautiful young woman, standing in a white gown next to a younger Grady--on thei wedding day.
62) 0) text: Grady, a PINK PRINCESS PHONE to his ear, lies on the bed  next to a huge TEDDY BEAR.

64) 2) dialog: Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
64) 4) dialog: I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some  things we need to talk about...
64) 7) dialog: Yes. But that's not why I called...
64) 9) dialog: What? No'. There's no one here. I'm just  ...just....
64) 12) dialog: (yelling)
66) 0) text: GRADY shakes his head, carries the phone toward the  bedroom WINDOW.
66) 1) dialog: Look, Sara. ..I'm not here. ..I'm not here to  . . . As GRADY watches, a late-model PONTIAC BONNEVIlLE turns  into the driveway below him. GRADY (cont'd)
66) 4) text: Goodbye, Grady.
66) 5) dialog: No. Sara, you don't understand...
66) 7) dialog: (dreading it) 
67) 2) dialog: Mom. Dad.
68) 3) dialog: Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed  up.
68) 5) dialog: What made you pull out that old thing?
68) 8) dialog: And?
68) 10) dialog: Maybe I should read it.
68) 12) dialog: Where's Emily, Hank?
68) 14) dialog: I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just.  ..want to know where I stand. Hank looks up, incredulous.
68) 16) dialog: (embarrassed)
68) 19) dialog: Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
68) 22) dialog: (sheepishly)
68) 25) dialog: Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about ail this. I  didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want  you to know that.
68) 27) dialog: I -just wanted to see her, I guess-- Emily.  And to see you too-you and Irene. And to let  everyone know that, even though it may be  difficult to comprehend now, this-everything  that's happening-it's not forever. It doesn't  mean "Goodbye."
69) 2) dialog: I'm really happy for you, James. But do me a  favor, will you? Lay off my dope. That stuff's  not for amateurs. James looks at Ziploc as GRADY fiddles with the heat  LEVER.
69) 4) dialog: (squinting at him)
69) 7) dialog: Jesus...  (thinking, then. . . )
69) 10) dialog: What?
69) 12) dialog: It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's-- (stopping)
69) 14) dialog: Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my  girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't  exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no  reason for him to take two in the chest. Still,  the fact remains that I'm the one who took you  up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one  who has to take the blame. I- don't know what  the hell I was thinking.
69) 16) dialog: Thanks for the halo, James, but I've . never  done that much thinking ahead in my" life-ever. James looks -out the window, pondering this.
69) 18) dialog: (feeling for the heat again)
69) 22) dialog: James, fall semester, first day of class, it  was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat. James just blinks, no ready answer-available.
69) 23) dialog: That's why they all give you such a hard time  in workshop.
69) 25) dialog: Because you act like a goddamn spook all the  time. Not to mention the fact that every last  one of them is jealous of you.
69) 28) dialog: Not you. Your talent. James' face hardens. He looks away.
69) 30) dialog: The hell I am.
69) 32) dialog: I never said that.
69) 34) dialog: I didn't mean it that way.
69) 36) dialog: Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and  Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking  about, okay? The entire class combined- including the lovely Hannah Green-has about one  tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay? James stares blankly at Grady, then turns his face to the window. He ponders Grady's words, the praise inherent in  them. A hint of pleasure glints in his eyes.
69) 38) dialog: Who cares what-. I said last night, James I I  was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a  dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me  some slack?
69) 41) dialog: And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares  what anybody thinks anyway? You want to .be a  good writer? You want to be-a great writer?  Then stop giving a damn what other people  think. Most of them haven't thought in .years. James turns, studies Grady's face as it flickers in the  first headlights of the evening.
69) 42) dialog: Let me spell it .out for you, James. Books  don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not  anymore.
69) 45) text: It's one of the reasons I wanted to become a  writer. GRADY stares ahead, watching the darkness tumble away  before the wide sweep of the Galaxie's headlights.
69) 46) dialog: Well, for that, if nothing else, James, I'm  sorry.
70) 0) text: GRADY rolls into a space near the coffee shop and James  slides out. GRADY stays put, hands still on the wheel.
70) 2) dialog: In a minute. Get us a table. James nods, pushes past the glass doors into the coffee  shop, and a big REDHEAD in a waitress cap leads him to a  table with a view of the highway. GRADY watches James-- stick figure in black brogues--slide into the booth and open his big, laminated menu. Finally, as if concluding some internal debate, GRADY  kicks open his door, steps out.
71) 0) text: GRADY rests his forehead against the PAYPHONE as he  speaks.
71) 1) dialog: C-a-r-v-e-I. That's right, Carvel. Yes, I'm  sure. It's outside Scranton. GRADY straightens up, takes a peek at James, sitting by  himself on the far side of the coffee shop.
71) 2) dialog: You have no listing. Okay, well, lady-- at  this very moment, as we speak, I'm looking of a  resident of Carvel, Pennsylvania. I think he'd  be pretty interested to learn that the good  people of Bell Atlantic have misplaced his  entire hometown. It's not like I'm making this  up as I go along-- GRADY stops, his own words ringing in his head. GRADY (cont'd)
72) 0) text: GRADY upends James' knapsack, sifts through: An  AUTOGRAPHED POSTCARD of FRANCES FARMER. A wrinkled box of CHICLETS. Nothing. Then he notices ERROL FLYNN'S eyebrows peeking at him from the knapsack's side pouch. He takes the book, opens it. Bingo. A library notice:  James Seiwyn Leer is three weeks overdue. Under ADDRESS i says only: "On File." But if one was to dial the PHONE  NUMBER, odds are it won't be the night janitor at the  Greyhound depot who picks up.
73) 0) text: The remains of a FRIED CLAM SANDWICH sit before James as  he turns his attention to a GIANT PIECE OF LEMON MERINGUE PIE. GRADY sips only coffee, stealing glances at the cars that whip by on the highway beyond the window.
73) 2) dialog: No thanks.
73) 4) dialog: Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like  we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't  have spells.
73) 6) dialog: I don't know. ...'Episodes.' James shrugs, spears a fluffy chunk of pie.
73) 8) dialog: I eat.
73) 10) dialog: When nobody's looking. GRADY watches a pair of headlights approach...
73) 12) text: I just worry about you, that's all. ...then pass. James' words finally register. GRADY looks  at him.
73) 13) dialog: You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
73) 16) dialog: Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat. GRADY moves off, then stops, looking back at James and  his giant piece of pie, still troubled by his words.
74) 0) text: As GRADY limps out of the coffee shop, he finds an OLDER  MAN in a TUXEDO standing in the open door of a gleaming  BLACK MERCEDES. Beyond him, in the front passenger seat, WOMAN in MINK examines her eye shadow in the tiny mirror the sun visor.

74) 11) dialog: Ah. Well, that's ail right. James and I 'had a  little dinner.

75) 0) text: James is glowering at the parking lot as GRADY returns.
75) 2) dialog: James. Listen. Things-things are a little  weird with me right now and I-- well--I have  enough blame to shoulder these days without  having to take the blame if something bad  happened to you. And if you hang around me long  enough, something bad is going to happen, trust  me. That's why I need you to go home.  Understand?
75) 4) dialog: James, like it or not, they're your parents.
75) 8) dialog: I remember that. Five or six years ago.
75) 10) dialog: (sardonically) 
75) 13) text: She makes me sleep in. the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me. GRADY glances toward the parking lot, studies the   contours of Fred Leer's face. Frowns.
75) 14) dialog: James, come on. That man is obviously your  father. You look just like him. James looks down at the table, takes a deep breath, and  speaks in a voice heavy with implication.
75) 16) dialog: Get out of here.
75) 18) dialog: In the crawl space, with the rats and the  casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up. As GRADY lifts him from the booth, James attempts a  plaintive tone, but his heart's not in it.
76) 0) text: As Fred Leer SLAMS the back door of the Mercedes, GRADY  waves vaguely, peers into the darkness of the back seat.

79) 0) text: Times Square before the ball drops. GRADY enters, scans  the room, then shoulders his way to the stairs.
80) 1) dialog: (entering) 
80) 6) dialog: No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it  out in the open like that. CRABTREE hasn't been  in here, has he? Poking around?
80) 8) dialog: Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that  aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
80) 10) dialog: Actually, He's not the Chancellor' s--What?
80) 12) dialog: Jesus.
80) 14) dialog: Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
80) 17) dialog: The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James  that day?
80) 19) dialog: But where? I need the street.
80) 22) dialog: Shit. As GRADY starts to turn away, Hannah hooks her finger  inside his belt buckle.
80) 24) dialog: Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but  right now I--
80) 27) text: Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting a. student- teacher conference? GRADY delicately removes Hannah's hand from his buckle,  points at Crabtree.
80) 28) dialog: You stay there.
80) 31) dialog: Gee, I don't know. Crabs. I don't seem to  remember you actually asking me if you could  invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
80) 33) dialog: (ignoring him)
80) 36) dialog: Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't  know.. .kidnapped.
80) 38) dialog: His parents.
80) 40) dialog: Good idea. Crabs. Only one problem. I don't  know where they live.
80) 42) dialog: It's a little late to call Admissions.
80) 44) dialog: Maybe ...I don't know.
81) 2) dialog: Love. It's Love facade--and what do you mean  'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two  chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling  methamphetamines.
81) 4) dialog: Only in your bones? GRADY smirks, glances at Crabtree, but gets a surprise;  CRABTREE offers no snappy come-back, no antic wordplay. H just stares out the window, his voice distant.
81) 6) dialog: How bad is it for you?
81) 8) dialog: Which is?
81) 11) dialog: What's to tell?
81) 14) dialog: Me too.

86) 3) dialog: Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll  leave you here.
86) 6) dialog: Ah, wear whatever you want. James flinches, stung, then disappears into a bathroom.
86) 8) dialog: So sensitive.
86) 11) dialog: It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just  once I'd like to know if the little bastard is  telling the truth.
86) 18) dialog: Yes? 'His heart...' CRABTREE hesitates, then... reads on:
86) 27) dialog: No. CRABTREE and James turn.

90) 1) dialog: Crabtree.

91) 0) text: Hannah Green lies tangled in the sheets, surrounded by  little colonies of Grady's manuscript. GRADY studies her, then detects something on the floor. The red boots. Delicately, he lifts the sheet. Hannah Green's feet--  finally revealed in ail their naked glory--prove to be  thick, wide, and ordinary. GRADY sighs.

As he pulls it into his lap, a LAMP in the living room pirouettes clumsily, spins free o the cord, and SHATTERS on the floor. GRADY blinks, looks away, and DIALS, just as. ..the  CLATTERING COUGH of an ENGINE is HEARD and a VAN appears. Stenciled on its side panel is: Kravnik's Sporting Goods The van slows, almost coasting, then abruptly bursts past Grady's house and disappears around the corner. GRADY  frowns, then realizes a MAN'S VOICE is coming from the  RECEIVER in his lap.

96) 1) dialog: Sara.

96) 6) dialog: (slumping to the porch)
96) 9) dialog: Inside.
96) 11) dialog: Over there. In the backseat of the... Grady's hand hangs in mid-air, gesturing pointlessly to  the driveway, where the only thing that exists is an oil  stain roughly the shape of North Dakota. GRADY (cont'd) 
96) 14) dialog: Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it  right there last night.
96) 16) dialog: Of course, I'm sure.  Ah, Christ, the puberty  police are back. Sara turns, sees Officer Pupcik cruising to the curb.
97) 1) dialog: (swinging in)
97) 4) dialog: Nevertheless. There's a police officer  standing on the porch and I don't think he's  going away.
97) 12) dialog: Thank you, Frankie and Annette. James swings his pale little legs to the floor and walks  bare assed across the room to retrieve his BVDs.
97) 15) dialog: And we both thank you for that, but we're...  we're... fine.
97) 17) dialog: Shut up, James.
97) 19) dialog: (a tad tense)
97) 20) text: There is no problem. Did I say there was a  problem? As James' head pops through Grady's fully-buttoned  flannel, he and CRABTREE exchange a knowing glance, at once referring to and  excluding Grady.
97) 23) dialog: Who do you think it is?
97) 25) dialog: Evidently.  (calling)
97) 28) dialog: It's Walter's dog and yes, she does. Know. But  let's spare her the details. Come on, your  shoes are in the hail.

98) 4) dialog: I'm a little worried, James.
98) 6) dialog: Well, let's see if we can keep that from  happening. James nods and GRADY starts to step back from the car.
98) 8) dialog: Yes, James.
98) 10) text: You're still the best teacher I ever had. On this,  Pete Pupcik pulls away, leaving GRADY standing  on the curb, watching the back of James' head, framed in  the rear  window of the police car, growing smaller.
98) 12) dialog: Would Walter really press charges?
98) 14) text: You didn't happen to call the house last  night, did you, Grady?
98) 15) dialog: I think I might have.
98) 17) dialog: I think I might've said I was in love with  you. Sara's face remains .unchanged. GRADY (cont'd) 
98) 20) dialog: And what did you say?
98) 23) dialog: Find the jacket.
98) 25) dialog: First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her  car.
99) 3) text: Stop it. Hannah looks up, sees GRADY in the doorway and blushes.  She pulls the sheet up, gives an oddly formal wave.
99) 6) dialog: Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in  discussing that business with the tango, try  the guy at the end of the hall. Jeff nods--puzzled--then goes. GRADY smirks.
99) 7) dialog: He cribbed that from Borges.
99) 9) dialog: Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could  borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of  commission.
99) 12) dialog: That good, hub?
99) 16) dialog: (stung)
99) 17) text: Hh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as  shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first  writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore,  it might interest you to know that one book I  wrote, as you say, 'under the influence, '  happened to win a little something called the  PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under  the influence. ' Hannah nods, averts her eyes, and immediately GRADY feels ridiculous. He starts to say something, but instead gathe his manuscript and exits.

101) 12) dialog: No wonder he screwed us over.

102) 4) dialog: It's good to know I'm still talented at  something. Keep the motor running.
103) 0) text: GRADY peers into the backseat, squinting against the WIND that swirls around him. Errol Flynn's face leers back at  him. But no jacket. GRADY slides in, pops the glove box,  and frowns at the ZIPLOC of Humboldt County. He pockets i anyway, then spies something else. James Leer's little PEARL-HANDLED PISTOL. GRADY takes it, rotates it-in his palm. SUNLIGHT GLINTS  off the chrome barrel and everything slowly turns to a  SWEET, SOFT BLUR...

105) 2) text: Double Dickel on the rocks. The last of the fairy dust evaporates and GRADY finds-  standing before him in a pink jersey dress and Marilyn  Monroe's wedding jacket--0ola, the pregnant waitress from the Hi-Hat Club.
105) 3) dialog: Oola.
105) 5) dialog: I never forget an Oola. Suddenly, there is a HEAVY CLICK.

105) 10) dialog: Who's got a gun?
105) 12) dialog: Relax, Vernon...
105) 15) dialog: Not true. You're the only Vernon I know.  Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon  Peabody at Penguin U.K.
105) 20) dialog: It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the  caps anymore.
105) 22) dialog: No, really.... GRADY lifts his arm, points the little pearl-handled  pistol to the DARK CLOUDS overhead.
106) 0) text: CRABTREE jumps as the tiny pistol at the end of Grady's  arm FLASHES, makes a FEEBLE POP in the wind.
107) 2) text: Get out! What's the matter with you? Can't you  see the condition my girl's in? As GRADY gets out of the car, Vernon places his hand on  Oola's tummy.

107) 10) text: Pull off, you crazy motherfucker! Frantic, GRADY steps between Vernon, the German Nine, and the oncoming Crabtree.
107) 11) dialog: No! Don't shoot! He's just a lousy driver. CRABTREE fans the wheel wildly, goes into a slide and the passenger door snaps wide, releasing what looks to be a  FLOCK OF WHITE DOVES into the wind-whipped sky. Only, these ain't birds.  В• - ^
107) 12) dialog: Oh... my... God!  These are PAGES. Seven years of-pages. CRABTREE goes into another slide, one-hops the curb, and  smashes flat into the weathered GLOVE of BILL MAZEROSKI  painted on the front wail of KRAVNIK'S SPORTING GOODS. As Hannah Green's RADIATOR EXPLODES, CRABTREE steps free  of the car and looks skyward. It's a ticker-tape parade a the way down the street, ending in the frigid waters of t Ohio River.  GRADY (cont'd) (to Vernon)
108) 0) text: Vernon drives, Oola at his side. In-the back, CRABTREE  puffs philosophically on a Kool while GRADY sits grimly  with the sad remains of his manuscript: SEVEN RUMPLED  PAGES, one of which bears the watermark of a shoe print.

108) 22) dialog: Ail right, all right It's done. There's no  need to talk about it. It's done. They ride in silence for a moment, then Oola turns,  glances at GRADY and his little sheaf of pages.
108) 24) text: Your book.  What was the story? GRADY stares into Oola's sweet, brown eyes.
108) 25) dialog: I don't know... Oola's brow wrinkles. CRABTREE glances at his old friend, genuine compassion in his eyes.

109) 5) dialog: Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
109) 7) dialog: Sure.
109) 12) dialog: It used to belong to Marilyn Monroe. She had  small shoulders, like you. Most people don't  know that. As Oola smiles, pleased, Vernon shakes his head.
109) 15) dialog: Came to my senses. CRABTREE Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is  James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell  to come to his?
109) 16) dialog: Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer  to jail, Crabs. I know that.
109) 18) dialog: No. But I don't think that matters.
109) 20) dialog: Nobody teaches a writer anything. You tell  them what you know. You tell them to find their  voice and stick with it, because that's all you  have in the end. You tell the ones who have it  to keep at it and you tell the ones who don't  to keep at it, too. Because that's the only way  to get where you're going.  (ruefully) 
109) 22) text: Maybe that's the only thing--that and Sara-- that's made the last seven years worthwhile. GRADY slides James' knapsack off his shoulder, smiles  cryptically as he considers it. - GRADY (cont'd)
109) 23) text: As for James, he doesn't need me anymore... Without warning, GRADY tosses CRABTREE the knapsack. GRADY (cont'd)
109) 24) text: He's got you. CRABTREE stares at the saggy green canvas in his hands,  watches GRADY walk away.
109) 26) dialog: Gee, I don't know, Crabs... (over his shoulder)
109) 27) text: Improvise. You're good at that. GRADY continues on, leaving CRABTREE to stand alone, as  he walks toward the buildings in the distance.
109) 29) dialog: You peeked, didn't you?
109) 32) dialog: You're not just trying to make me feel better? CRABTREE looks directly at Grady, his old friend.
109) 34) dialog: Well, thanks for that, Crabs.
110) 0) text: Dead quiet. Gradually, STEPS are heard, coming from the  stairwell, then GRADY limps into view.
111) 0) text: GRADY surveys the room. Empty chairs. Empty desks. He walks to a WINDOW, the same window he stood at two  afternoons ago when reading James Leer's story. A chill  breeze pitches the fabric of his shirt as he studies the  barren benches and icy walkways of the quad. Finally, he- turns away, settles behind his desk and, reaching into hi pocket, removes the seven remaining pages of his  manuscript. He considers them, then folds them in half  length-wise. He continues, folding the top right corner  down into a triangle along the first crease...
113) 0) text: GRADY hobbles into the lobby just as one of the  auditorium doors swings open. APPLAUSE SWELLS and he spie Sara standing inside, talking to a STUDENT USHER.

113) 3) dialog: (pushing past him)
114) 0) text: GRADY enters, but Sara is ...gone. He picks his way  behind the back row, scanning the aisles.
114) 3) dialog: No... But GRADY looks anyway. Hannah sits a dozen rows down the aisle, hair pulled back in a clip, glorious skin gloaming The Goatee Kid sits close beside her.
114) 5) dialog: Jeff. He comes from a long line of tango  dancers.
116) 0) text: As a CHUBBY WOMAN stands to acknowledge the applause,  GRADY cranes his neck, searching the sea of seats. To his surprise, he finds CRABTREE sitting prominently in the  front row, in his shirtsleeves, smiling his spookily  complacent smile. James is next to him, now wearing  CRABTREE'S METALLIC SPORTS COAT over Grady's flannel shir
116) 5) dialog: Take a bow, James! James turns, spots GRADY in the back row, then-a sheepish grin on his face--spreads his arms, hangs his head, and  takes his first sweet public bow. GRADY (cont'd)  (softly)

It's a steep drop, very steep, ending in a small rectangular space, a kind of  basement office, with VENDING MACHINES, PLASTIC CHAIRS, a a COLLAPSIBLE CARD TABLE. GRADY turns back to the door he came through, pushes  against it. Locked. He sighs, looks back at the stairs, h ailing ankle, then sits. He fishes out the Ziploc of-  marijuana, considers the perfectly roiled JOINT floating  atop the bag of buds, but, for once, isn't up to it. The  SOUND of FOOTSTEPS echoes far below and, hopeful they're  Sara's, GRADY pulls himself up, peers over the railing. It's Traxler, with a broom, a big plastic bag.
119) 1) dialog: Yo, Traxler.
119) 3) text: Hey, Professor Tripp. GRADY considers the Ziploc in his hand, looks down again.
119) 4) dialog: Do you get high, Sam?
119) 7) dialog: As a heart attack.
119) 10) dialog: Looking for you. He wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... ALL GOES BLACK AS SARA'S VOICE CALLS... faintly at first, then more forcefully, calling Grady's  name, calling so insistently that the earth seems to RUSH upward until we see that she is... KISSING him or something, and all goes softly... Blue.
120) 0) text: GRADY lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue plastic curtains in a blue room. Through a gap in the  curtains, he can see the bottle of-GLUCOSE that drips  slowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. Flakes of SNOW fall outside. The DOOR SQUEALS, a SHADOW ripples across the blue, then  the curtains part and a RESIDENT with a clipboard appears His NAMETAG says GREENHUT.

120) 21) dialog: Actually, it was her husband's dog... Greenhut glances up, looking GRADY in the eyes for the  first time, and GRADY stops.
120) 23) dialog: They're anxiety attacks? That's a little  disappointing.
120) 25) dialog: So is my friend...is Sara still here?
120) 27) dialog: I have to see her. As soon as possible. Greenhut studies Grady, calibrating the desperation in  his eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch.

126) 0) text: The snow continues to fall as GRADY lumbers down the  street. Finally, wearily, he stops, sits his crippled sel on the curb. He plunges his fist into his jacket and.  ..straight through the lining, James Leer's silly little  pistol at the end of his hand. He considers the pistol,  then looks up into the sky. GRADY'S POV - of the SKY...  ...dark and menacing. Suddenly, a THUNDERCLAP shatters  the silence. NEW ANGLE - GRADY ...still sitting with the gun in his  hand.
126) 1) dialog: (as if addressing God) 
126) 2) text: Is that a suggestion? GRADY sits, blinking the snow out of his eyes, then TWO  SHAFTS of-LIGHT dance across his shoes. A white Citroen  DS23 appears.  It passes.  Slows.  Stops.  GRADY stares at the car, burbling at the curb, then lifts himself up and makes his way to the driver's window. Sara makes a face, bugging her eyes a little-mad at him, but-  not without humor. Then she rolls down the window.
126) 3) dialog: I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
126) 5) dialog: I'm through improvising.

126) 19) dialog: Did you tell Walter?
126) 21) dialog: Does he still love you?
126) 23) dialog: Well I do. I've always loved you, Sara. I  didn't know it at the time, but I'd always been  waiting for you. My whole life. Because you're  who I need.
