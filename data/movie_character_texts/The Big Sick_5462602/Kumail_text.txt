43) 19) text: No, she's not. They won't tell us anything. We've been here all morning. KUMAIL
43) 21) text: You guys broke up. I'm not sure why you're here. You don't have to worry about being committed to anything, Kumail. You didn't want to when she was awake. There's no need to do it when she's unconscious. KUMAIL

We see a flashback of Emily wearing the sweatshirt. He opens a cigar box on her dresser and pulls out POLAROID pictures. They're of him and Emily. More flashbacks of Emily. TERRY (O.S.)

Thick New York accent like nobody I'd ever met. Totally wrong for me. So naturally we fell-in-love. My family could not stand him. We're all military people, army pilots. All my brothers played football. Terry couldn't even change a tire. My father got so mad he broke every dinner plate we had. Now back then, you go to the gas station, you fill up your tank, you get a dinner plate. But just one at a time. Cup, saucer. It took us a year of fill-ups to get the whole set back. And Terry just stuck around. Eventually they just all got over it. KUMAIL

67) 7) text: Oh no. Emily should not be moved. The hospital will approve it because it'll get the liability off their hands, but we put her in a coma for a reason. To stabilize her. Moving her could be very dangerous. The infection could spread. Trust me she is fighting. And so are we. Kumail looks frightened.

81) 1) text: Emily has a rare condition called Adult Onset Still's disease. Kumail mentioned Emily's hurt ankle and the swelling still hadn't gone down even after several days in bed, which is strange. Still's disease is when the body thinks healthy tissue is an infection so it tries to fight it. It's like a big biological misunderstanding. TERRY

85) 0) text: Beth comes outside into the hallway. KUMAIL
85) 2) text: Yeah. She's got physical therapy. KUMAIL
85) 4) text: It's so strange that we could go through one of the most intense experiences of our lives together and just never see each other again. Beth puts her hands on Kumail's face. She looks at him. BETH
85) 5) text: Maybe. But I hope not. They smile. Kumail walks out of the hospital.
86) 0) text: Kumail backstage with other comics. Chris is on-stage. Kumail sits on a chair going over his notes. CJ and Mary walk up to him. MARY
86) 2) dialog: Are you serious?
86) 9) dialog: We don't have to keep going over how bad the set was. I saw their faces and the noises they didn't make.
86) 11) dialog: Doesn't that happen every month?
86) 13) dialog: What about Chris? 100 Chris performs on stage. MARY
86) 19) text: Hey, clink clink! Thank you everybody for coming. I just wanted to say a couple of words here. Emily clocks Kumail as he WALKS IN holding a large bag. EMILY (leans over to Beth)
86) 20) text: Why is Kumail here? BETH
86) 25) text: It was a clementine, full disclosure, it's those little ones that a baby monkey could peel, but she did it. And that's all, thank you everybody. Kumail finally approaches Emily. KUMAIL
86) 27) text: Right. KUMAIL
87) 0) text: They walk in. Lots of jackets on the bed. KUMAIL
87) 1) text: So, I've been collecting some things that are important to me and I wanted to show them to you. I call this my bag of devotion. Kumail presents the BIG BAG and starts to take items out. He holds up a bunch of HOSPITAL PASSES. KUMAIL (CONT'D)
87) 2) text: This is all the visitor passes from when I visited you when you were in the- He holds up some TICKET STUBS. KUMAIL (CONT'D)
87) 4) text: What did you do? Did you cremate someone? 102 KUMAIL
87) 5) text: These are the ashes of all the Pakistani women - not the women - the pictures of the Pakistani women. I thought this was a good idea, but it feels a little stupid. Kumail puts the items down and kneels before Emily. KUMAIL (CONT'D)
87) 7) text: Kumail, I'm really glad that you went through this experience, but you have to understand that all that happened while I was asleep. Like you felt one way a few weeks ago and now you're saying you feel the total opposite way and the only thing that's changed is that I was in a coma. Honestly, I look at all of this, and I just think, I can't do it again. I can't be the reason that you don't have a family. It just feels totally different now. And I can't do that again. Do you understand? KUMAIL
87) 8) text: Okay. Kumail packs up his bag of devotion.
87) 9) text: -- Kumail drives a passenger around. -- Kumail cleans his room. -- Sharmeen, Azmat, Naveed, and Fatima have a family dinner. Kumail's not there. -- Emily does physical therapy with Beth and Terry. -- Kumail drives passengers around. -- Emily, Beth, and Terry eat take out together. -- Kumail at the theater works on his one-man show. 103 -- Emily in bed with Beth sleeping next to her. Terry by himself on the sofa. -- Kumail and CJ put up fliers for Kumail's one man show. -- Kumail makes a Facebook page for his one man show.
88) 0) text: Kumail enters the dining room without knocking on the door. Azmat, Sharmeen, Naveed, and Fatima are eating dinner. Kumail joins them. We see he has another LARGE BAG. KUMAIL
88) 1) text: Ma. Dad. Fatima. Bhai. There's no plate. Oh I forgot. I've decided I won't let you kick me out of the family. Since I am a member of the family, it would stand to reason that I would get a vote in whether or not I get kicked out, and that vote would have to be unanimous. Standard parliamentary procedure. So all those in favor of not kicking Kumail out of the family, raise your hand. Kumail raises his hand. Everyone else stares silently. KUMAIL (CONT'D)
88) 2) text: Great. Motion to kick Kumail out of the family, denied. So you guys can just talk to me. Everyone is silent. KUMAIL (CONT'D)
88) 3) text: Okay, you're giving me the silent treatment. I figured that was what was going to happen. I have a solution. Kumail pulls out cue cards from his bag and shows them. KUMAIL (CONT'D)
88) 4) text: "Hi. How are you?" It's just a real basic one. "Pass the salt." Practical. "Always with the comedy." Mom, made that one specially for you. "Kumail, how did you become so much more handsome than your brother Naveed?" 104 NAVEED
88) 5) text: Bullshit. Naveed and Azmat exchange a look. KUMAIL
88) 6) text: I admit this one is designed to stir up some controversy. "It's interesting how you can't really kick someone out of your family because they'll always be your family." I agree with that one. It's a good one. So, I'm gonna leave these here for you. Kumail leaves the cards on the dining table. KUMAIL (CONT'D)
88) 7) text: I'm sorry I lied about the girls and the LSAT and all of that. That was wrong. And one more thing: I'm moving to New York to pursue stand-up, but I am not leaving this family. Kumail leaves. Eye contact around the table.
89) 0) text: The marquee says "KUMAIL NANJIANI: CITIZEN". People filing into the theater.
90) 1) dialog: And we'd go to the mosque and hear graphic details of religious people being killed 1400 years ago. I mean like Tarantino-esque details. And everyone would be crying, like competing to see who could cry the hardest. And I could never cry. And I was like, what is wrong with me? Am I broken?
92) 0) text: Kumail is with Naveed in the empty theatre. Naveed wears sunglasses. KUMAIL
92) 2) text: Yeah. I mean, yeah. Emily enters hesitantly. KUMAIL
92) 4) text: Hi... KUMAIL
92) 6) text: I was in the neighborhood and I saw that you were gonna be here so I thought I'd come say hi. KUMAIL
92) 8) text: Oh, well within range. KUMAIL
92) 9) text: Nice. They stand there. It's tense. KUMAIL (CONT'D)
92) 13) text: It's so good to finally meet you. (to Kumail)
92) 15) text: Okay, well I'm going to just... goodbye. Naveed slips out as Emily and Kumail stare at each other.
94) 0) text: Kumail and Emily sit on the bed from his show together. EMILY
94) 1) text: When something like this happens, there's this sort of expectation that you're going to have this completely new lease on life and feel totally different about everything. Like cherish every sunrise. And for the most part I just feel like, ugh I can't get up that early. I'm sorry, I feel like I've been talking about myself so much. Are you doing a lot of stand-up? KUMAIL
94) 3) text: I saw the video. It wasn't great. I'll be honest with you, it wasn't great. KUMAIL
94) 5) text: But there was a lot I liked. Like a lot I liked. KUMAIL
94) 7) text: Really? KUMAIL
94) 9) text: When do you leave? KUMAIL
94) 11) text: I'm so excited for you. That is great. I think you are going to do so great in New York. 110 KUMAIL
94) 13) text: What? KUMAIL
94) 15) text: Oh, just that I wanted to thank you. My parents told me everything you did for me and I feel like the last time we spoke I didn't properly thank you so- KUMAIL
94) 17) text: I should probably go. KUMAIL
95) 0) text: CJ, Mary, Kumail, and Chris are packing BOXES into a car. CHRIS
95) 1) text: The scene is gonna be so different with you guys gone. KUMAIL
95) 3) text: Nah. I'm good here. I'm gonna miss you. KUMAIL
95) 4) text: I'm gonna miss you. Kumail and Chris hug. 111 CHRIS
95) 6) text: Come here, you big dummy. Chris hugs Mary. Kumail is distracted as a CAR pulls up nearby. Kumail stares at it. After a beat, Kumail's dad Azmat pops out and walks up to Kumail. AZMAT
95) 7) text: You are still kicked out of the family, but because we did not get a proper chance to say bye to you... Your mother is so angry with you. She is not going to get out of the car. She's not even going to look at you. And I don't believe you kept so much secret from me, your father. KUMAIL
95) 9) text: Here. She asked me to give this to you. Azmat hands Kumail a TUPPERWARE CONTAINER. AZMAT (CONT'D)
95) 10) text: Biryani. For your trip. Your favorite. She made it herself specially for you with extra potatoes. KUMAIL
95) 11) text: Thank you Ma. Kumail looks to the car. Sharmeen is in the backseat. She averts her gaze when she sees him looking at her. KUMAIL (CONT'D)
95) 13) text: Right now? No. KUMAIL
95) 15) text: I am forbidden from hugging you. So. It was nice to have you as my son. Goodbye forever. And do me a favor, when you reach New York, just text us and tell us that you've reached safely, okay? 112 Kumail nods. KUMAIL
95) 18) text: Her favorite song. Why are you asking? KUMAIL
95) 19) text: Just curious. Azmat nods and heads back to the car. He gets in and drives off. Kumail gets in the car with CJ and Mary and they drive off.
97) 0) text: Kumail performs comedy in front of a room full of NEW YORK HIPSTERS. He's killing. CJ and Mary are there too. Kumail takes a sip of water. KUMAIL
97) 2) text: 113 KUMAIL (CONT'D)
97) 3) text: It's a lie anyway. And I'm like, well it has to be believable. If I told them I want to be a doctor, they'd be like, "bullshit." If I say lawyer, they're like, "oh, ok, that's something." Cause there's a strict hierarchy: doctor, engineer, lawyer, hundreds of jobs, ISIS, then comedian. A very loud WHOOOOO emanates from the crowd. Kumail looks out to the crowd to see Emily, beaming at him. He is taken aback. KUMAIL (CONT'D) (stumbling)
97) 5) text: Oh that wasn't a heckle. I just kind of woo-hooed you. KUMAIL
97) 7) text: So if I was like, oh my god, you're amazing in bed! That would be a heckle? KUMAIL
97) 9) text: Chicago. KUMAIL
97) 11) text: I'm here to see someone. KUMAIL
