42) 4) text: Mr. and Mrs. Gardner. The doctors would like to see you now. BETH (whispers, to Emily)
42) 7) text: She exits.    Terry nervously taps on his knees, annoying Beth. BETH Terry, Terry-- it's driving me insane. TERRY I know, I know. But it makes me feel better.
42) 9) text: Beth and Terry stand to greet her. DR. CUNNINGHAM (CONT'D) Please sit. I'm Dr. Cunningham, Emily's attending. I'll be coordinating all the doctors and orchestrating her treatment strategy. BETH "All the doctors"? How many are there? DR. CUNNINGHAM Five. BETH Five? Why so many? Is that normal? Dr. CUNNINGHAM Yes, it's standard with patients in the ICU. We come at it from different angles--
42) 10) text: 50 When we cut back it is a different person now. DR. LEWIN. Terry, Kumail and Beth stay but the doctors change. DR. LEWIN

43) 25) text: I'm just gonna stay for a second. Is this seat- ? Kumail gestures to the empty seat next to Beth, but she throws her sewing on it and turns away. Kumail walks to another row of seats and sits down, facing Emily's parents. Beth watches him intensely for a few beats before Kumail turns to the woman sitting next to him. KUMAIL (CONT'D)
43) 28) text: No reason you should eat there by yourself. Right, hon? BETH (barely looks up)
43) 30) text: How's your sandwich? BETH
43) 33) text: So, uh, 9/11? Blank looks from Kumail and Beth. TERRY (CONT'D)
43) 38) text: I mean we lost 19 of our best guys. BETH
43) 40) text: That was a joke, obviously. 9/11 was a terrible tragedy, and it's not funny to joke about it. Beth and Terry are PAGED on the intercom. They quickly gather up their things and get up to leave. KUMAIL (CONT'D)
43) 45) text: I know this isn't the news you were hoping for but we aren't ready to bring Emily out of the coma yet. BETH
43) 48) text: The antibiotics aren't doing exactly what we'd hoped they would, and we don't want to mess around. So we're going to perform surgery tomorrow morning to remove the infection. BETH

46) 13) text: No. That's stupid. Beth shrugs and goes back to the computer. Terry looks at the inscription, frowns, puts it back. 58
47) 0) text: Kumail leaves the door open a crack. He sees in the LIVING ROOM Terry and Beth are whisper-quarrelling. He begins to clean. Pulls a MARIJUANA PIPE and BAG OF WEED off the dresser and shoves it into the back of her closet. He notices the BRAINS SHIRT in the closet. He touches it. We see a flashback of Emily wearing the sweatshirt. He opens a cigar box on her dresser and pulls out POLAROID pictures. They're of him and Emily. More flashbacks of Emily. TERRY (O.S.)

64) 17) text: They're doing it. They're the experts here, and I trust them. BETH
64) 18) text: Well that's very nice. But I don't. Can you unlock that thing? Beth hands the phone back to Kumail, he unlocks it, hands it back. BETH (CONT'D)
