42) 9) text: Beth and Terry stand to greet her. DR. CUNNINGHAM (CONT'D) Please sit. I'm Dr. Cunningham, Emily's attending. I'll be coordinating all the doctors and orchestrating her treatment strategy. BETH "All the doctors"? How many are there? DR. CUNNINGHAM Five. BETH Five? Why so many? Is that normal? Dr. CUNNINGHAM Yes, it's standard with patients in the ICU. We come at it from different angles--
42) 10) text: 50 When we cut back it is a different person now. DR. LEWIN. Terry, Kumail and Beth stay but the doctors change. DR. LEWIN
42) 17) text: Our theory is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. TERRY (taking NOTES)

43) 31) text: Best fuckin' sandwich I've ever had. TERRY
43) 32) text: Mine's good. Tuna's always a gamble. You know, we're not by the water. Well, we are by the water, but it's a lake. There's no tuna in the lake. Whatever. I threw the dice. I got the 7's, I guess. Whatever the good dice number is. More silence. TERRY (CONT'D)
43) 33) text: So, uh, 9/11? Blank looks from Kumail and Beth. TERRY (CONT'D)
43) 35) text: You've never talked to people about 9/11? TERRY
43) 40) text: That was a joke, obviously. 9/11 was a terrible tragedy, and it's not funny to joke about it. Beth and Terry are PAGED on the intercom. They quickly gather up their things and get up to leave. KUMAIL (CONT'D)
43) 46) text: Oh. I- TERRY
43) 49) text: Wait a second- Dr. Spellman told us that the antibiotics would work. He didn't say anything at all about surgery. 56 TERRY
43) 51) text: It's called thoracentesis, it's a very common procedure. We're going to go in between the ribs and remove the infection. TERRY (scribbling in his notebook)

46) 3) text: I'm gonna do some research. TERRY
46) 5) text: No, I gave her that one. Hey, do you have that little notebook from the doctors? Terry hands her the notebook. TERRY
46) 8) text: I remember. I met her at the falafel place and then we went to that book store that's hardly ever open and I bought it for her. TERRY
46) 10) text: What's up with you? TERRY
46) 12) text: Look at the inscription. TERRY
46) 13) text: No. That's stupid. Beth shrugs and goes back to the computer. Terry looks at the inscription, frowns, puts it back. 58
47) 0) text: Kumail leaves the door open a crack. He sees in the LIVING ROOM Terry and Beth are whisper-quarrelling. He begins to clean. Pulls a MARIJUANA PIPE and BAG OF WEED off the dresser and shoves it into the back of her closet. He notices the BRAINS SHIRT in the closet. He touches it. We see a flashback of Emily wearing the sweatshirt. He opens a cigar box on her dresser and pulls out POLAROID pictures. They're of him and Emily. More flashbacks of Emily. TERRY (O.S.)
47) 2) text: Hey. TERRY

47) 14) text: Jimmy was a real guy? TERRY
47) 15) text: Yeah, well there was no particular Jimmy, whoever got hit with the chalk, he was the Jimmy. Kumail gets a call from Naveed on his phone. He ignores it. TERRY (CONT'D)
47) 16) text: I'm just trying to figure out what to do. Kumail and Terry walk into the living room.
48) 0) text: Kumail and Terry walk back in. Beth is on her laptop. KUMAIL
48) 1) text: Yeah, tonight's no good for me. I'd love to, but I'm actually gigging tonight, which is like an industry word we use for when we do shows. TERRY
48) 4) dialog: Oh. That's cool. I haven't been to comedy show since the 80's - Rita Rudner at Caroline's. Remember that, hon?
48) 6) dialog: (nervous) Maybe we should go to Kumail's show. What do you think? Wouldn't that be fun?
48) 8) dialog: Okay listen, why don't we go to the comedy club with him? It'll take our mind off of things right now.
48) 10) dialog: Please. I need the distraction.
48) 12) dialog: No, I want you to come with me. I don't wanna be alone.
48) 15) dialog: But you can get us in? You're the headliner, right? That's what you said. I mean, if you're the headliner, you can get two more in, right? 61 Kumail looks pained. KUMAIL
48) 16) text: That's a good point. TERRY
48) 18) text: They've got waffle fries and um- Kumail turns and begins to head out the door. TERRY

51) 15) text: I want to name my kid Void so he won't be able to cash any of his paychecks. Beth and Terry watch from the audience, laughing. KUMAIL (CONT'D)
51) 42) text: I'm gonna fucking kill you! What's your fucking phone number?! Terry heads out after Beth. TERRY
51) 43) text: I'm sorry everybody. I'm sorry. He stops in front of the Heckler. TERRY (CONT'D)

53) 0) text: Beth, Terry, and Kumail enter, all a bit shell-shocked. BETH
53) 4) text: On top of the fridge. TERRY
53) 7) text: I am so sorry about that. That was... I just sort of lost control. TERRY
54) 0) text: Kumail, Terry and Beth are eating pizza. BETH
54) 2) text: Oh like tonight? No, usually a different mom comes in to help me. I'm joking. No, it's not always like that. I'd quit if it was. TERRY
54) 4) text: No, Terry, don't. Terry's about as funny as a fart at a funeral. TERRY
54) 6) text: Oh that was the end of the joke? TERRY
54) 8) text: That was the whole joke? TERRY
54) 10) text: I thought there was more. TERRY

55) 6) text: I like wine cause of the buzz. 69 TERRY
55) 8) text: So is Terry! He'll be passed out on the sofa in less than an hour! TERRY
55) 27) text: I laughed so hard when I saw these. She got so mad at me. Kumail laughs. Terry stirs. KUMAIL
55) 29) text: Are you kidding me? He can sleep through anything. Hey Terry! She claps and Terry shifts, but doesn't wake up. 71 KUMAIL
55) 30) text: How did you and Terry meet? BETH
55) 31) text: I was going to East Carolina University and I was waiting tables. We met at this coffee shop, I was waiting on him. I liked his hair. He was a teacher already. Thick New York accent like nobody I'd ever met. Totally wrong for me. So naturally we fell-in-love. My family could not stand him. We're all military people, army pilots. All my brothers played football. Terry couldn't even change a tire. My father got so mad he broke every dinner plate we had. Now back then, you go to the gas station, you fill up your tank, you get a dinner plate. But just one at a time. Cup, saucer. It took us a year of fill-ups to get the whole set back. And Terry just stuck around. Eventually they just all got over it. KUMAIL

62) 8) text: Here, look at the comments. TERRY
63) 0) text: Terry talks on his cellphone and paces. Dr. Cunningham tracks him down. DR. CUNNINGHAM
63) 1) text: Terry - Hi. Can we talk? TERRY
63) 3) text: We got the biopsy results. They are unfortunately inconclusive. We are concerned- Music drowns out the rest of their conversation as Terry looks increasingly distraught.
64) 0) text: Terry speaks with Beth and Kumail. 78 TERRY
64) 2) text: But they took out the infection so it shouldn't matter? TERRY
64) 4) text: But the kidneys are so far from the lungs. TERRY
64) 6) text: I'm calling Northwestern. TERRY
64) 8) text: Terry! Goddammit! KUMAIL
64) 10) text: --You shut up! I'm sick of this shit, Terry. We're getting her out of here! TERRY

64) 15) text: I can't find my cellphone. You got a phone? TERRY
64) 16) text: Don't give her a phone. You don't need a phone. You don't need to call anybody right now. Kumail takes out his phone, hands it to Beth. She starts fiddling with it. TERRY (CONT'D)
64) 19) text: There's a reason why they're #17 and Northwestern's #1. And it's not because people trust them! TERRY
64) 21) text: I don't think I'm smarter than you! You just don't think you're as smart as I am! That's not my fault! TERRY
64) 23) text: Oh there are some things that are definitely just your fault. TERRY
64) 25) text: And you need to stop being a coward. TERRY
68) 0) text: Terry balls up his coat to use as a pillow, trying to get comfortable. Kumail enters. TERRY sees him and sits up. KUMAIL
68) 1) text: Hey Terry. I was just talking to the nurse - You okay? TERRY
68) 2) text: Yeah, of course. Totally fine. Terry's eyes are very puffy and red. TERRY (CONT'D)
68) 3) text: Beth went to Emily's, so I'm gonna wait here until they kick me out. Keep an eye on her. Long pause. Terry and Kumail staring at one another. KUMAIL

70) 8) text: Not really. That's none of my business. TERRY
70) 10) text: It's getting really late. We should go to sleep. Kumail turns off the light. A beat of quiet in the dark. TERRY

70) 14) text: Okay. TERRY
70) 16) text: Math teachers? TERRY
70) 18) text: Yeah. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Get a full night's sleep. Catch up fresh in the- TERRY
70) 20) text: 84 TERRY (CONT'D)
70) 22) text: Yup. TERRY
70) 24) text: She might be mad at you, but she doesn't hate you. You should've heard the way she was talking about you. Hey, can I ask you something? Why did you tell her? TERRY
70) 26) text: Do you guys talk about it? TERRY
70) 28) text: So, to fully know I love someone, I have to cheat on them? TERRY
70) 29) text: Out loud it sounds stupid. Yeah, that's terrible advice. Terry is clearly fraught. TERRY (CONT'D)
70) 31) text: I don't really get that either. TERRY

73) 6) text: I know. We're moving her. She's right. Terry walks towards Beth as Kumail follows. KUMAIL
73) 9) text: Well, they don't see her. This nurse sees her and she told me herself. 89 TERRY
73) 10) text: It's okay. They don't need to see her. Beth and Terry gather their things to leave, and Kumail grabs a form out of Terry's hand to stop him. KUMAIL
73) 11) text: It's not okay. There. I got it! TERRY
73) 12) text: That's a map of the garage. Beth and Terry begin to walk down the hall. KUMAIL
76) 8) text: The fuck've you been, man? You're on next! Dodd runs off. On stage, Mary is doing well. Kumail's phone rings. It's Terry. Kumail hesitates. Then answers. We see Kumail's face. He doesn't say anything. On stage - Mary finishes her act. We hear Terry's voice on the call. TERRY (O.S.)
76) 9) text: Kumail, it's Terry. Listen, we're not moving here. The doctors, they said.. We don't hear the rest of the call. DODD

81) 0) text: Cunningham speaks with Terry and Beth. DR. CUNNINGHAM
81) 1) text: Emily has a rare condition called Adult Onset Still's disease. Kumail mentioned Emily's hurt ankle and the swelling still hadn't gone down even after several days in bed, which is strange. Still's disease is when the body thinks healthy tissue is an infection so it tries to fight it. It's like a big biological misunderstanding. TERRY
81) 3) text: We gave her anti-inflammatories and she stabilized within hours. She's gonna take time to recover but she'll be fine. TERRY
83) 0) text: Kumail goes up to Beth and Terry. KUMAIL

84) 0) text: Terry walks in. Beth sits on Emily's bed as Kumail watches through the window. Beth notices Kumail.
86) 21) text: Cause he was there the whole time. I invited the nurses, I invited him. TERRY
86) 22) text: Emily, come on up here. I wanna say something. Emily stands up and makes her way to Terry. TERRY (CONT'D)
