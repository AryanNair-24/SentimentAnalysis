2) 14) text: Um, my name is Kumail. EMILY
2) 17) text: Yeah. Now that the niceties are out of the way, I have to tell you that when you yelled at me, it threw me off. You really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's so rude. EMILY
2) 19) text: Okay, that's a common misconception. Yelling anything at a comedian is considered heckling. Heckling doesn't have to be negative. EMILY
2) 22) text: Wow. Goodbye! Jessie walks away. EMILY
2) 24) text: What's your name? EMILY
2) 25) text: Emily. Kumail writes Emily's name in Urdu on a napkin. 7 KUMAIL

5) 1) text: Do you want to watch a movie? EMILY
5) 3) text: Yeah, I would say it's safe. You know what, go for that area. I cleaned that earlier this year. Kumail points to a corner of his room covered in dirty clothes. 9 EMILY
5) 5) text: No, it's a shoes off bed. I have strict rules. Emily crawls onto the air mattress. EMILY

7) 18) text: That's good. EMILY
7) 19) text: No. It's really not good. I had acne, and I was a Goth and I had this terrible perm. The kids called me Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually I do know why, it's because they thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I think I'm done with this subject. In fact, I think I'm gonna go home. Emily gets up, pulling the blanket with her to hide her body. Kumail holds onto it, stopping her progress. KUMAIL
7) 20) text: Wait we haven't even had sex again yet. 12 She tugs the blanket, he lets go. She dresses behind it. EMILY

30) 2) text: I know you're bummed. Look, Emily's a good person, I'm not saying she's not. All I'm saying is this is the universe telling you: seize your moment. Be a little selfish and pursue your career. Bob Dalavan's gonna be here on Thursday. If you book the Montreal Comedy Festival, it would change things for you.

I'll be coordinating all the doctors and orchestrating her treatment strategy. BETH "All the doctors"? How many are there? DR. CUNNINGHAM Five. BETH Five? Why so many? Is that normal? Dr. CUNNINGHAM Yes, it's standard with patients in the ICU. We come at it from different angles--
43) 25) text: I'm just gonna stay for a second. Is this seat- ? Kumail gestures to the empty seat next to Beth, but she throws her sewing on it and turns away. Kumail walks to another row of seats and sits down, facing Emily's parents. Beth watches him intensely for a few beats before Kumail turns to the woman sitting next to him. KUMAIL (CONT'D)

57) 0) text: Emily lies unconscious in her hospital bed. 73
67) 7) text: Oh no. Emily should not be moved. The hospital will approve it because it'll get the liability off their hands, but we put her in a coma for a reason. To stabilize her. Moving her could be very dangerous. The infection could spread. Trust me she is fighting. And so are we. Kumail looks frightened.
68) 3) text: Beth went to Emily's, so I'm gonna wait here until they kick me out. Keep an eye on her. Long pause. Terry and Kumail staring at one another. KUMAIL

72) 31) text: Because I'm in love with someone. I am. Her name is Emily and she's gonna be a therapist. And right now she's very sick but I couldn't tell you that. It makes me so sad that I couldn't tell you any of that. I really appreciate everything you've done for me. I truly, truly do. And I know Islam has been really good for you, it has made you good people, but I don't know what I believe. I just need to figure it out on my own. SHARMEEN
73) 7) text: What? No. I told you what the nurse said. Hey Beth, the nurse told me that moving Emily could be a very bad idea. BETH

80) 21) text: Honey, we'll be right outside. Terry and Beth and leave with Dr. Cunningham. Kumail approaches Emily. KUMAIL
81) 1) text: Emily has a rare condition called Adult Onset Still's disease. Kumail mentioned Emily's hurt ankle and the swelling still hadn't gone down even after several days in bed, which is strange. Still's disease is when the body thinks healthy tissue is an infection so it tries to fight it. It's like a big biological misunderstanding. TERRY
