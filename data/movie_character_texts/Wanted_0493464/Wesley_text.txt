Splits the skin and pushes it back through its center, filling the space it just passed through. Sloan looks at him, like he might have been underestimating him until now.

64) 27) dialog: You'll find one entry below the shoulder, missing the major blood vessels there, exiting the back. Second shot went through the abdomen, clipped only the bowel and exited cleanly. Third hit the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, which is partially protected by the ribcage, and passed through the liver and probably part of the gallbladder. Upper left abdomen is a good place, where number four ruptured the spleen before continuing down main street. And finally, what I like to call "the ,7FK." Number five entered the mouth, was redirected downward by the upper jawbone ON, and exited the back of the neck. That's the shot you'll find in the middle of the target. Gunsmith sticks his finger through the hole in the middle

69) 49) text: Protecting our assets. She hands the clip from the Imanishi over to Wesley...
70) 0) text: Wesley and Fox walk down a long hallway toward a single doorway. They open it, revealing...
71) 2) dialog: You've known all along. You knew before I ever broke the urn...
71) 4) dialog: Part of my training.
71) 6) text: And his killer. Wesley nods, a grave expression on his face, like he knows what he is going to do next.
72) 10) dialog: There are two things about you I'm sure of right now, little man. One is that you can speak English... Pek War sees that Wesley means business.
72) 12) dialog: That my nutsack is bigger than you. Fox snickers.
72) 18) dialog: Bullshit. You're as responsible as if you pulled the trigger yourself.
72) 26) dialog: I'm only going to ask you one question and I want you to think very hard how you want to answer. With that, Wesley sticks the stiletto into Pek War's side!
72) 29) dialog: Relax. The blade is in only an inch or so. The little man starts jabbering to God in some foreign language.
72) 30) dialog: See I've learned a thing or two about human anatomy recently. In fact, this blade is stuck just beneath the coastal cartilage of your tenth rib. Just a little push and it will deflate your lung. That's called a pneumothorax. V Helluva way to go, suffocating in a'room full of fresh air. Plus the sound, the sound of all that oxygen hissing out of your lung... pssssssh, like a balloon at a birthday party. Enough to make a man beg for a second chance. (BEAT)
72) 32) dialog: So my question is... how do I find Cross? Pek War's eyes go wide, pleading...
72) 34) text: My clients use middlemen, I don't meet them in person, I know so little about them... Wesley twitches the handle just a bit.
73) 0) text: The Porsche once again tears across the asphalt, as Wesley drives.
73) 2) dialog: You know what my foster mother. told me when I was six years old? Fox shakes her head.
73) 3) dialog: She caught me eating some jello out of the fridge after my bedtime. I knew I wasn't supposed to but I was so damn hungry, and it was just some fucking jello. Anyway, after she hit me so hard I couldn't bite down straight for a week, she told me... she told me that God had killed my parents because I was such a wicked boy.
73) 5) dialog: So I grew up thinking I was the reason I never knew my parents. But now, to find out, that no, my father didn't give me up because he had died... he gave me up because he was Protecting me... well I guess I want to give him something back.
74) 0) text: They are surrounded by industrial looking warehouses, one of which has the words Times-Herald on it. Newspaper delivery TRUCKS make their way in and out of the loading dock area of this building. Overhead, an EL TRAIN scrapes along the worn tracks. Fox pulls around a corner and back into an alley, so they can have a view of the corner in front of them. Wesley scans the area quickly.
74) 1) dialog: Not very discreet, are they? Fox smiles knowingly, and looks up, revealing what Wesley is talking about. On various rooftops we-see FIGURES peering down. looking over the site.
74) 10) dialog: No! The minute Bellman exposes himself in the open loading dock door he is cut down from inside, his bloody body falling backwards into a newspaper truck parked at the dock. Wesley and Fox join the other two on the dock as screaming WORKERS run from the place.
74) 13) dialog: He'll be long gone by then.
74) 15) dialog: On the pallet. They all jump on the pallet held by the forks of the lift. Wesley throws the machine in reverse and it backs into the warehouse, the four assassins safely crouching on the pallet on the front.
74) 22) dialog: Separate. The lowest level is the loading dock, where pallets of newspapers and massive unused paper rolls await.
74) 25) dialog: (to the Waiter) Stay here and cover us. There's no angle for him to hit you if you stay here. Wesley points at a scaffolding that runs above the machines.
74) 31) dialog: Don't let him get up there. And stay clear of the presses! He'll use them however he can.
74) 33) dialog: It's what I'd do. With that, Wesley and Fox disappear amongst the machinery. The Waiter takes a step back from the press, where over a hundred pounds of paper spins through every second. He sticks his head out to try and keep an eye on that scaffolding. Everything looks clear, until... ...shots ring out and a shelf o w a1l o Waiter's head gives way! He turns to see a bunch of cans of spray lubricant falling to the floor. No big deal, until Cross shoots one of them out of the air, causing it to explode! The burning oil covers the Waiter, who SCREAMS and stumbles nearer the printing press...
74) 43) dialog: Cross! Unafraid, Cross climbs up on a desk on the other side of the office. Without hesitation, Wesley opens fire at Cross... who immediately returns fire... .and his bullets actually collide with Cross's by ets in mid-air!!! The bullets ricochet and take out a COMPUTER SCREEN where someone was playing SOLITAIRE. The two assassins blast away, all while diving and moving over and in the cubicles. Cross has a gun similar to the Imanishis, and they each steer their bullets at each other from sharp angles... Strangely,. the first bullet collision was not blind luck but the pattern for the battle. They are fighting the same fight, their bullets meeting in the middle, each man using the same techniques at the exact same time. Wesley needs an angle, and spots a DRY ERASE BOARD the words "Action Items" written on it. He fires at it, and his bullets bounce off it at an angle where one of them strikes Cross in the shoulder... THWAP!!! Cross can't believe he's hit but he doesn't have time to flinch... right as Wesley fires again, he turns, barely avoiding the rain of bullets and leaps through a nearby window, smashing the glass out,
75) 12) text: Everything they told you was a lie, Wesley. With that... Cross falls down. His black jacket spills open to show a gun shot wound not just to his shoulder, but to hig n too. one of Wesley's bullets through the train must have found its mark. Cross is bleeding profusely. He gasps a couple of times... then, with his last bit of energy...
75) 21) dialog: He said... he said 'pies on the Fraternity...' Fox measures him, like she's not sure if he's telling the whole story. Finally, she nods...
75) 23) dialog: Yeah, sure.
75) 25) dialog: I think I need.a minute to myself.
75) 28) dialog: Naah, that's all right. You need to get stitched up. I'll meet you at that Korean place.
76) 0) text: Wesley walks down the street. PEOPLE instinctively get out of his way as he cuts a path down the sidewalk. Then he pulls out what Cross slipped inside his pocket: a beaten-up copy of COUNT OF ONTE CRISTO. In fact, there's no mistake, it's the same copy he had as a kid. Wesley tries to make sense of this as he opens up the cover... printed on the inside in a steady hand are the words: "I left you something." Wesley lowers the book and sees a cheesy guy park a Harley at a curb. He bee-lines for the guy.
77) 0) text: Wesley now blazes down the highway, pushing the Harley to its limits. His angry expression hasn't dissipated.
78) 3) dialog: Hey.
78) 5) dialog: You live here? The kid.nods .
78) 6) dialog: Foster home? 4014 The kid nods again.
78) 12) dialog: Read this. He tosses the kid the book and heads off.
79) 0) text: He pulls the Harley over to a curb and then reaches into his jacket pocket and withdraws the note and the key. Across the street, the address matches: 1850 N. Highbury. The place looks like a concrete fortress... no windows, just a large-iron door in front. Wesley approaches, not sure what the address could mean. He gets to the door, looking for a key-hole, but he doesn't find one. He fidgets there awkwardly for a second, but then... .the door opens, revealing a woman, ANNA. She takes a look at Wesley and then puts a trembling hand over her lips.
79) 4) dialog: Yes, ma'am. She nods knowingly, sadly.
79) 6) dialog: ГўВњВ“ He killed my father...
79) 14) dialog: My brother?
79) 27) dialog: I'm okay. Wesley sets the key down on the table.
79) 28) dialog: Do you know what this opens?
79) 36) dialog: (STEELY)
79) 37) text: He left me more than this. Wesley takes the coat and folds it over his arm.
79) 39) dialog: Why didn't he just tell me?
79) 42) dialog: I'll be back as soon as this is over.
80) 8) dialog: Skipped the hospital?
80) 12) dialog: I'm all right.
80) 14) dialog: Naah.
80) 20) dialog: Yeah. (BEAT)
80) 23) dialog: Did you know Cross was my father?
80) 25) dialog: Did you know? Closer, closer... tight on those pupils...
80) 36) text: Wesley only has a millisecond to respond,-and he does by kicking over the table, which sends food and utensils flying, but also shields him from Fox's bullets. Just as quickly, Fox leaps up on top of one of the other tables, trying to keep her heels on the sides so that her feet don't touch the hot grill. If she's wounded, we wouldn't know it. Wesley does the same on a nearby table. They take shots at each other as they leap from table to table, avoiding the sizzling centers, but they're both so quick that no bullets find their mark. Then Fox takes a running leap at him, moving ferociously fast. She's like the animal she's named after, and she launches off one of the tables... .and catches Wesley flush, kno in him backwards, a form tackle on to a table... ..where he lands Quare on the oven top... PSSSSBHH... and his guns go flying across the room as... .the table to starts to burn through his clothes!
80) 38) dialog: Arrrh!
80) 47) text: Aaaaahhhh! She's firing both muzzles and her bullets find the marks this time, knocking Wesley's guns out of his hands from where he lies flat on the floor. She's disarmed him, and now he's defenseless... .and Fox stands over him, breathing hard, her face bleeding, both gun barrels pointed right at Wesley's face...
80) 57) dialog: There's a town in Germany called Leverkusen that had a bear hunter named Hans Koblenz.
81) 1) dialog: 60 During his life, he was said to have killed over four hundred bears and was the pride of this small community on the Rhine. You want to know how he died? A pair of black bears singled out his house from the entire village, mauled his wife, killed his twin daughters, and then lied in wait for him to get back from the woods.
82) 0) text: The fire is out, but it has blackened the inside of the joint, so that it looks like an absolute war zone. Fox is in the same position as when Wesley shot her, but there's a sheet of paper folded on her chest. The Butcher and the Pharmacist flank Sloan as he approaches the body, frowning.
82) 1) dialog: When the hunter opened the door, they ripped his throat out before he could scream. (MORE)
82) 7) dialog: The two bears then curled up on the rug LW in the middle of the floor -- the rug that had once been their father -- and proceeded to bite. each other till they bled to death. Sloan reaches down and picks up the paper, and sees beneath it that pearl-handled revolver. The one with the blood on the handle.
82) 8) dialog: That's a true story. He unfolds it, to read printed in black ink on the paper:
83) 0) text: Wesley stands in the slaughterhouse, holding two pistols, looking around. The place has been cleaned out. There's no sign of the Butcher.
85) 0) text: .and in the Fraternity's library, nothing. All the books are gone... Wesley processes this, frowning. He keeps walking to the...
86) 0) text: Anna opens the door for Wesley, who looks like he is on to something...
86) 1) dialog: My father... he was working on a plan, right?
86) 3) dialog: Can I see that for a second? The boy hands him the building in his hand. It is painted jet black, except for one corner of the first floor, which is painted red. Wesley looks up at Anna.
86) 4) dialog: Do you know where he got this?
87) 0) text: Anna leads Wesley down some wooden steps into Cross's basement. Sure enough, the entire floor of the basement has been made into a model map, similar to the one that the Fraternity used in the map room, but all the buildings are black, with an occasional red mark. The scale is larger, the model shows only one section of the city, and a BLUE LINE indicates a route through the streets. And on the wall are PICTURES and CLIPPINGS of Henry Helms. Wesley squats over it, trying to figure out what his father's plan was. He sees a missing place for a building and puts Andrew's toy back in place, then studies the map some more.
87) 7) dialog: (AWED)
87) 9) text: This is a Fraternity hit. Cross... my fathar... set up Henry Helms as bait, knowing Sloan would use his best men for the job. He was going to take them all out. Wesley looks at it some more.
87) 10) dialog: Only he didn't know where on the route they would try and hit Helms. That's the missing piece he was t rying to figure out.
87) 12) dialog: No. But I know who does.
88) 8) dialog: It's me, Nicole.
88) 10) dialog: I asked you once if you thought I was an observant person. She doesn't understand... but suddenly we...
89) 0) text: .that meeting room from his old job. In fact, it's a replay of that same scene. Wesley is still sitting there with his note pad, the words "LIFE SUCKS AND THEN YOU DIE" printed over and over, while the consultant continues to rattle on and on. Through the blinds behind the speaker, Wesley spots the hot intern Nicole, still talking on the phone. And just like before, he's zeroing in on her, but this time, we keep zeroing in and zeroing in, until we see something we didn't see before... Nicole reaches up over the counter to grab a stack of papers, and her shirt pulls slightly up from her back... .and that tattoo of Cerberus. &amp;)A- three-headed !log ,printed there, in the exact same place Fox had...-and we keep zeroing in on it and zeroing in on it until we...
90) 3) dialog: (playfully back) Maybe I have and I'm just not telling you. .and now with the gift of hindsight, we see that Wesley meant what he said, and we...
91) 0) text: Wesley still stands there, just a few feet away from her.
91) 1) dialog: Sloan didn't just have one person in my office watching me, he had two.
91) 3) dialog: What name do you go by? The Intern? He points at her tattoo.
91) 4) dialog: Because I know you have the mark. Nicole's face changes, goes hard, like someone flipped a switch. Like lightning, she grabs for a butcher's knife but Wesley is faster. He pins her wrist back, twisting until she drops the knife. She lunges again, but a pistol comes up right below her chin.
91) 5) dialog: Where's the Henry Helms hit going down? Where's Sloan?
91) 12) dialog: Yeah? Why's that? She reaches over, slowly, so he knows she's not going to go for a knife... and she turns on a small TELEVISION sitting on the kitchen counter. The screen comes to life, showing an inf mercial for the F ob'e. Nicole shakes her head and. flips up the channels... and now we see what she wanted to show him...
91) 24) dialog: Motherfucker. Dispose of the weapon... (BEAT)
91) 27) dialog: (ignoring her) I'm only going to ask you one more time. Where can I find him?
91) 29) dialog: Then this is going to get painful quickly. She stares at that blue flame, fear in her eyes for the first time. He starts pushing her head toward it, closer and closer...
91) 30) dialog: Henry Helms. Where is it going down? The first SCREAM from Nicole is lost in...
92) 0) text: SIRENS wail and a HELICOPTER hovers nearby as Wesley stands on a roof, looking down on the scene. He sees EMT's roll a gurney out toward an ambulance as COPS cover every inch of the ground. From where he is, it looks like every cop in the city is here.
93) 0) text: Wesley steps out of a dark doorway, his hard eyes following a police car as it roars by without noticing him.
98) 17) text: Wesley? The CAMERA MOVES TO THE SIDE to show Wesley crouched right behind him, a look of icy determination on his face as he holds the knife in place.
98) 23) dialog: (GROWLS)
98) 25) dialog: Looks like you missed your chance. Now where is Sloan? The Gunsmith feels the edge in Wesley's voice.
98) 28) dialog: (WHISPERS)
98) 30) dialog: Should've studied your anatomy, fellas. Wesley FIRES BACK indiscriminately at the neighboring rooftops, lying on his back, using the.dead assassin's body as a shield.
99) 0) text: Wesley bursts from the stairwell doorway and moves to the front door of the building. He clicks the empty cartridges out of his guns and is about to reload when he hears a sickening sound behind him... The sound of two knife blades being rubbed together... .and Wesley turns to f' the Butcher there waiting for The Butcher quickly hurls a knife, which buries in_the fleshy part of Wesley's shoulder 1 Wesley ignores it and fires... i L
99) 3) dialog: I remember some dumb shit like that coming out of your mouth. Wesley tosses the guns in his pockets and then nulls out the kniZ2 in his shoulder. They charge each other, the blades whizzing and clanging off each other as each tries to gain an edge. The fight spills out the front door, and into...
99) 11) dialog: But you can hear. So hear this: To cut the subclavian artery, hold the knife ice- pick style... Wesley lunges and the Butcher is defenseless to stop it.
99) 12) dialog: ...and thrust down behind the clavicle, cutting side to side. He does just as he describes and the big guy topples over as his gore spills out into the street. But before he can gloat, Wesley realizes his new predicament... He's standing in the middle of the street, and at one end is the chef, and at the other is the Gardener. To make things worse, directly across the street from Wesley is the Pharmacist, and each has a gun on him.
99) 14) text: That's what I'd call a real ball ache. For a moment, Wesley stands there, sizing up the situation. His eyes swivel from the Gardener to the Chef to the Pharmacist. Just then, the buildings ound all of them go black., just like in cross's model! Wesley's eyes fall on the on the red corner of the nearest building, a cement block making up a decorative support column in front of it.
99) 20) dialog: I'm working off of a different map. With that, the world goes back 12 its natural colorB, and he races for the building, jumping up onto and over a Lexus parked at the curb. The three assassins fire relentlessly at him, but their bullets slam into the car, smashing it to bits... as... . on the other side of it, Wesley goes into a slide just as he reaches that cement block... affixed to it is a small SILVER CROSSI Wesley slaps his hand on the Cross and the cement block mechanically opens, revealing: a new pair of sophisticated MA ISHIS I As his adversaries converge on him, Wesley takes the guns, spins, splits both hands apart and we...

100) 3) dialog: But now you have to dispose of the weapon.
100) 10) dialog: Fuck you. Sloan's eyes narrow.
100) 13) text: But that's not gonna happen. Like I told you before, when we are called, death is as certain as the sun. Wesley stands as straight as he can muster. The two men face each other like two gunmen on Main Street in Dodge city... an old newspaper even blows through like a tumbleweed. And we are close on Wesley's face. act it i the same shot from the opening of the movie.
100) 14) dialog: Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic. We see now that his healthy hand is inching away from his bleeding arm, reaching into his sleeve...
100) 15) dialog: But not today. With that, he nulls out the matching pearl-handled gun, the twin-brother of the one Sloan is holding, and they both open fire... .Wesley shoots Sloan's bullets out of the air and Sloan does the same. Just like he did with h' father. .But Sloan is good, and one of the bullets finds it's mark, hitting Wesley sSMarely in the same arm that took the knife.
100) 21) dialog: Uhhh! He can't raise his arm, it's useless, but he's come too damn far to stop now... he flips his gun from his good hand to his bad hand and manages to keep FIRING! Then Wesley does something unexpected... he starts sprinting straight at Sloan, still knocking his bullets out of the air... He closes the gap... ten feet... five feet... ..a surprised and worried expression now spreads on Sloan's face,.like what is this kid doing? But Wesley is not stopping, he shoots the gun out of Sloan's hand and then closes on him, tackling him off his feet! They go flying right over the edge of the building. Wesley's able to grab on to a railing cable and stop himself... ..but Sloan is going to go over. At the last moment, Sloan reacher. for-something. anything. and grabs one-handed the barrel of Wesley's gun... For a moment, they dangle there in this precarious position, looking each other in the face. Sloan can't believe he's been bested by this kid.
100) 23) text: Go ahead and shoot me, killer. Just like you did your old man. Wesley's finger starts to squeeze the trigger, but then he smiles...

A sign attached to one wall reads: "SAN ANGELO INSURANCE ASSOCIATES: Setting the Bar Highl" Office workers mill about in their drab suits and ties, wishing they were anywhere else. A pretty RECEPTIONIST comes over to Wesley's desk.
