One sign on the larger road says "GLOBE" is 29 miles away other sign, on the lesser road, tells us "SUPERIOR" is on miles. A third sign confirms his destiny with "Gas, Food, Mile." BOBBY seems to have no choice. He aims the car down the l road towards "Superior, Arizona."

6) 43) text: Now do you mind? I got to get some stuff out of the trunk. He throws the car key to Darrell who takes the hint, spit grotesquely into the dirt, scratches his nuts, and walks to the shack.

Sports pages a betting sheets are piled inside. With a look around, Bobb the gun and stashes it underneath the rubber mat in the t Briefly we notice a towing ROPE under the mat.

16) 38) text: Would you kill her? Bobby starts to laugh. Bobby stops laughing. JAKE
16) 39) text: Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again.  Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.

Sweat forms on his brow as he stan directly behind Grace with his hands extended before him. hover just below her shoulder blades ready to push forwar Suddenly Grace wheels.  Startled by Bobby she almost fall the edge.  Bobby grabs her, her weight still going back. Grace's life is literally in his hands.  She looks down a ground far below, then up into Bobby's eyes.

Women say they don't want to be taken like, really taken -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there (points) at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away. Bobby is quietly stunned.
