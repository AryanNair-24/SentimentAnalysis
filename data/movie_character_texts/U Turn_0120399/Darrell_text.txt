6) 42) text: It's not just a car. It's a sixty-four and half Mustang convertible. That's the difference between you and me, and why you live here and I'm just passing through. The trunk lid rises in the air, partially blocking Bobby Darrell, acting as a partition between them. BOBBY
6) 43) text: Now do you mind? I got to get some stuff out of the trunk. He throws the car key to Darrell who takes the hint, spit grotesquely into the dirt, scratches his nuts, and walks to the shack. Concealed by the trunk lid, Bobby pulls out a GUN (a .9mm Baretta), wrapped in a t-shirt, from the top of the bag. we see a flash of green money, lots of it. Sports pages a betting sheets are piled inside. With a look around, Bobb the gun and stashes it underneath the rubber mat in the t Briefly we notice a towing ROPE under the mat. There is a travel bag, from which he peels a fresh bottle of Percoda quickly taking two, as well as the sports page.

19) 19) text: What's that got to do with the radiator hose? DARRELL
19) 21) text: It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money. DARRELL
19) 23) text: Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had. Bobby digs through his bloodied wallet, trying to hide it Darrell. He fishes out a five dollar bill. Then digs out bloody one dollar bill from his pocket. BOBBY

36) 25) text: Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, who knows me. Bobby is in a rage.  He turns to leave and walks a few pa He sees a WRENCH lying on a table.  For a second his mind then he snatches up the wrench and turns ready to smash i on Darrell's head.  He stops cold.  Because ol' Darrell h CROWBAR in a batter's stance ready to smash it onto the M DARRELL
36) 26) text: You want to play, Mister?  I'll play with you.  You want to smash something?  So do I. Darrell pulls back the crowbar, ready to swing. BOBBY
36) 27) text: No! Okay! Okay! DARRELL

36) 40) text: You motherfucker! (etc.) DARRELL
36) 41) text: You can't help yourself, can you mister? You're out of control. Darrell starts to laugh. It is a repetitive, almost demon laugh that grows louder as the camera slowly dollies in o Bobby's anguished face.
50) 3) text: Keep it. There's a suggestion of cockiness in Bobby, feeling his l coming back with the night. His humour is enhanced by his down the street: As DARRELL, with his dilapidated truck, readies SERGEI'S convertible for towing. BLIND MAN (OVER)
56) 2) text: That's my gun...(then) That fucking Darrell! JAKE
56) 3) text: I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out. BOBBY (realizing)
56) 7) text: No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car.

73) 11) text: Well, there's a $50 overnight storage charge we got to talk about. Bobby is ready at first to explode, but then just laughs loud. You got to give it to a guy like Darrell. He holds $100 bill. BOBBY
73) 12) text: All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change? DARRELL
73) 14) text: Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it. Bobby pulls the hundred back from Darrell's grasp. DARRELL (going to get the keys)
73) 16) text: Course you don't. Tell me something Darrell. Forty thousand people die every day! How come none of them are you? DARRELL (throws him the keys)
73) 18) text: And the trunk key. DARRELL (pulls out the trunk key)
73) 20) text: Listen up good, Darrell. I'm getting outta this shithole. You're staying! And one little peep outta you -- remember that gun makes you part of the food chain. Your prints are all over it. I'd be awful careful whose rectum I was pointing my finger in, Darrell. Bobby hops in the car, a free man. As Darrell glares at h bewildered and frightened at the same time.
79) 63) text: Adios -- Suddenly, the RADIATOR HOSE Darrell installed blows apart loudly. Bobby knows exactly and immediately what it is as cloud of steam now rolls from under his hood. He shakes h head, frustrated. BOBBY (sighs)
