And in the distance, but GROWING: THUNDER. CAMERA STARTS TO MOVE -SLOWLY, INEXORABLY, ACROSS this de We are in a Sergio Leone TIGHT CLOSEUP of just a hideousl wanders. CAMERA MOVES AGAIN. The wind is really kicking up --- suddenly, another STOP. Another Leone CLOSEUP. A second man. This guy makes the first one look handsome. Both his eyes work, which is an improvement. But his neck has been horribly burned as if from a noose. CAMERA IS MOVING AGAIN. LOUDER THUNDER. A storm is coming fast. CAMERA STOPS. We are LOOKING AT the least appetizing of the three. that he's scarred, not that all his parts aren't in proper working order -- it's just that he's so damn frightening. Not Not to mention huge. This is THE ANGEL and like the other two, he is seated on a horse. And he is staring intently at something. FROM The Angel -- we go to...
0) 4) dialog: (riding closer) I almost got hung myself once, didn't much care for it, how about you? (as Maverick says nothing) We're gonna leave now, but I'm worried about your well-being. Maverick just stares at him, makes no reply.
0) 5) dialog: He gestures for the other two to ride, and they take off.
0) 6) dialog: See, I don't think it's a good thing for a man to be alone out here. Your mind can do cruel things. And now he takes a burlap sack, tosses it toward Maverick. It lands nearby.

But it's the other three we pay most attention to. First is a very young man. Late teens, looks less. Thin. Small. A hundred and thirty pounds after a big meal. This is THE KID. Seems ordinary. Next to him sits, of all things, a woman. But not ordinary, certainly not in these surroundings. She's elegantly-dressed, close to being beautiful. She's married, has a deep Southern accent, and hasn't been poor for a long time. Maybe she's thirty. She seems a rotten poker player, but a wonderful flirt. This is ANNABELLE BRANSFORD. Next to her sits The Angel. We met him already -- he tossed the burlap bag of rattlesnakes at Maverick just before the hanging. Huge, powerful, not much makes him smile, except winning at cards. There is an empty seat at the table.
17) 7) dialog: glaring at Maverick. he'll hang Maverick. (We know that within a week, But they haven't met before.)

17) 18) text: 14 Of the cattleman casually making a bet. Very casually. Of Maverick, who doesn't seem to be paying much attention. He loses again, smiles. Now the preacher is staring at his cards before betting. For a long beat. And the cattleman is fiddling with his chips. The chips in front of The Angel are sloppy. The chips in front of Annabelle are neatly stacked. She flicks her fingernails against her front teeth, makes a bet. The businessman is toying with his necktie. The Angel is holding his cards, moving the top to the bottom, then repeating, the top to the bottom. And Maverick loses again, smiles again, just happy to be there. Annabelle is suddenly helpless, giggling, staring at what she's been dealt. The Angel is smiling happily. He rakes in a pot. The businessman's fingers are tapping on the table. The Kid's hand covers his mouth. The Angel is bored, looking neither at the other players or the pot. Annabelle bets big and wins -- maybe she's not such a rotten poker player after all. Maverick tosses in his cards. Another loss. He smiles, glances at the clock on the wall -- an hour and a half have gone by.
19) 24) dialog: A look of contempt crosses his.
19) 25) dialog: You always been gutless?

21) 14) dialog: watching.
21) 29) dialog: watching, stunned at what he's seeing out there in the night, and -MAVERICK spinning, throwing an elbow into the gut of the nearest big man. The blow connects perfectly and the Guy starts to double over, his knees weak, and he falls.

37) 13) dialog: I want to know the joke.
37) 15) dialog: Explain that!
37) 17) dialog: (hard to talk) He paid you to fall down.
37) 24) dialog: as he slowly rips off a piece of the bar and starts swinging it, catching them off guard -- it goes like a streak this next --- but what he does is cream each of th fall to the floor -THE ANGEL (not even breathing hard) I'll let you fall down for free. (he looks down at the stunned quartet) Maverick was mine anyway... (beat) ... 'cept now it's personal... HOLD ON The Angel. 37 Now --
76) 13) dialog: Another kick into the stomach. This one harder. Maverick is beginning to go pale. Impossible to breathe now.
76) 14) dialog: Should have paid your cowhands more, Maverick. (and now kicks Maverick brutally in the neck -- ) Lucky for you I'm not the kind who minds being made a fool of. As he gestures for others to join him in beating the hell out of Maverick -ANGEL I never would have let you make the poker game -- but before you done what you done, I might have let you live.
93) 1) dialog: How the hell did you get here -tell me -MAVERICK -- No, bastard, you tell me -what did you mean when you s you never would have let me make this game? Who was trying to stop me?
