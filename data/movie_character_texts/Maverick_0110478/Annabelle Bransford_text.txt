But it's the other three we pay most attention to. First is a very young man. Late teens, looks less. Thin. Small. A hundred and thirty pounds after a big meal. This is THE KID. Seems ordinary. Next to him sits, of all things, a woman. But not ordinary, certainly not in these surroundings. She's elegantly-dressed, close to being beautiful. She's married, has a deep Southern accent, and hasn't been poor for a long time. Maybe she's thirty. She seems a rotten poker player, but a wonderful flirt. This is ANNABELLE BRANSFORD. Next to her sits The Angel. We met him already -- he tossed the burlap bag of rattlesnakes at Maverick just before the hanging. Huge, powerful, not much makes him smile, except winning at cards. There is an empty seat at the table.
17) 4) dialog: (lilting Southern accent) It is now. (smiles at him) My name is Annabelle Bransford. And what do people call you?
17) 18) text: 14 Of the cattleman casually making a bet. Very casually. Of Maverick, who doesn't seem to be paying much attention. He loses again, smiles. Now the preacher is staring at his cards before betting. For a long beat. And the cattleman is fiddling with his chips. The chips in front of The Angel are sloppy. The chips in front of Annabelle are neatly stacked. She flicks her fingernails against her front teeth, makes a bet. The businessman is toying with his necktie. The Angel is holding his cards, moving the top to the bottom, then repeating, the top to the bottom. And Maverick loses again, smiles again, just happy to be there. Annabelle is suddenly helpless, giggling, staring at what she's been dealt. The Angel is smiling happily. He rakes in a pot. The businessman's fingers are tapping on the table. The Kid's hand covers his mouth. The Angel is bored, looking neither at the other players or the pot. Annabelle bets big and wins -- maybe she's not such a rotten poker player after all. Maverick tosses in his cards. Another loss. He smiles, glances at the clock on the wall -- an hour and a half have gone by.

23) 43) dialog: You're going to let me go?
23) 45) dialog: (crossing to the door and slamming it as he nods, a beat) Damn.
23) 47) dialog: You -- you irritate me -- you're just so... (looking for the word) ... likeable.
23) 53) dialog: There you go doing it again. Being likeable. You know what I think? -- if we'd met under different circumstances, we'd have just hated each other. There is not Mrs. Maverick, is there?
23) 55) dialog: I can be likeable too. (quickly now, she comes into his arms) I wish we'd never met. Good-bye. See?

51) 18) dialog: Look at him -- bursting with pride.
52) 2) dialog: How do we know he was nice? We don't know anything about him. All he had in his wallet was the names of some whorehouses. And now, O.S., the sound Maverick's voice in song -MAVERI who has started into "Amazing Grace" --- and the shocker A strong, firm voice echoing out over the rough land.

54) 33) dialog: Jesus, what kind of animal are you?
54) 48) text: 56 Maverick sneaks through the brush with Annabelle at his side. Coop follows a step or two behind leading the horses. He keeps his eyes pealed as they track.
54) 50) dialog: They could have been stolen. What's with you and Indians anyway?
54) 52) dialog: I'm your partner. Fifty-fifty.
54) 60) dialog: Well, I suppose sixty/forty would be acceptable if you're going to be recalcitrant... Maverick and Coop do a double take on this.
54) 62) dialog: (with condescention) Education.
54) 64) dialog: (lady-like) I'm going to help. At that moment Annabelle loses her footing on the trail and lurches forward. She grabs onto Maverick, clutching onto his gunbelt, as she tries to keep her balance. Annabelle FIRES ONE ROUND into the ground (with his gun still in his holster). Maverick turns and looks at her in amazement.
54) 65) dialog: Seventy/thirty?
54) 71) dialog: Big tracker! Follow a couple of horse tracks. Anyone could do that. You're not so great.
