He's landed stunned It's impossible to tell which one of them will strike first. Now -TWO GNARLED HANDS That's all we see at first, just the hands. One of them grabs the burlap sack, the other starts scooping up the rattlers, putting them back inside. No fear of consequences. One-two-three-four-five-six, and the rattlers are gone from view. And once they are -PULL BACK to reveal... the MAGICIAN, for that, we will learn, is the name of the woman we are looking at. Little old woman, more precisely. Weird-looking little old woman, more precisely still. She is dressed in clothing that neither fits nor matches. When she talks, she talks very loudly. Clearly she doesn't get a lot of company. Right now she isn't talking at all, just staring at Maverick's still body. Mounted on her strange little cart is the biggest buffalo gun you ever saw. It is what blasted the tree branch to the ground. And smoke still drifts out of the barrel and hangs in the air. Now she takes a foot, pushes Maverick over so he's on his back. Next she aims the huge weapon at Maverick's heart. (CONTINUED)

80) 119) dialog: She places the wad of money next to the cards, gestures for Maverick to start. He hesitates, then -MAVERICK He starts breathing more deeply. It's almost as if he's trying to enter a different state. He stares up -GIANT CLOUDS moved by the wind.

80) 133) dialog: I was watching -- you were getting into a trance -- you were almost there.
80) 135) dialog: You give up too fast -- if magic was easy, everyone would do it. You want to win that poker thing, don't you? (CONTINUED)
80) 140) dialog: Well, you're not gonna win nothing without a spot deep inside that tells you it's okay. A spot that says, 'Be a fool if you want, just be the best fool around, and I'll stay with you forever.'
80) 142) dialog: You think when I was little and playing with dolls I thought, 'I can't wait to grow up so I can be a hermit and have rattlesnakes for friends?'
80) 143) dialog: 
80) 144) dialog: I was whipped and beaten and left to die and I could have, but that spot talked to me, it told me, 'No, don't let the world piss on you, it's okay to live alone, rattlers don't talk back and they're more honest than most people, get a move on.' (beat) Now I'm a great hermit and I wouldn't be nothing else.
80) 147) dialog: Point of my story.
