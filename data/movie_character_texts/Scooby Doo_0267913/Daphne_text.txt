The DEMON REX, a gargantuan, fiery, winged beast, streaking down through the center of the soul tube, rushing TOWARDS us. His black eyes are deep-set, hollow and wet. Deathly talons sprout from his wings. His thin disgusting tongue flips up over his face, slithering over his steely sharp beak. There is nothing beautiful about this creature. Nothing tender.
