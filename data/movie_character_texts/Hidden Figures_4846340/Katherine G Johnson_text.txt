4) 7) dialog: If the product of two terms is zero, then common sense says at least one of the two terms has to be zero to start with. So, if you move all the terms over to one side, you can put the quadratics into a form that can be factored, allowing that side of the equation to equal zero. Once you've done that, it’s pretty straight forward from there... You can hear a pin drop. There’s nothing to say. Katherin shuffles. Adjusts her glasses. KATHERINE (@8 YEARS OLD) (CONT’D) -..Sir.

There are 20 bright, highly capable Negro women in the West Computing Group. And we’re proud to be doing our part for the country. Katherine adjusts her glasses.
27) 57) dialog: So, yes...they let women do some things over at NASA, Mr. Johnson. But it’s not because we wear skirts...it’s because we wear glasses. She walks off. Jim Johnson watches her go, he’s speechles And very, very enticed.
