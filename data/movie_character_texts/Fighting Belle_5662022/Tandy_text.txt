18) 21) dialog: Don't clench your fist. Keep your fingers relaxed. (jabs in slow-motion) Straight from the chin. Then squeeze right before ya reach your target. Delilah jabs again. A little better.
18) 22) dialog: Okay. Now this time, turn your fist a little when you punch. (shows her) Like that. So ya go from holding your fist vertical to horizontal.
18) 24) dialog: Just keep doing it. Watch yourself in the mirror. I'm sure you can manage that. Slice stalks over to Tandy as Delilah jabs away.
18) 26) dialog: There's something there. It's just buried under a pile o' grits. 28.

21) 18) dialog: You wanna farm or you wanna box? Delilah stands her ground. 30.
21) 19) dialog: Alright. But no boxer I know's got nails like that. (puts scissors away) I guess you know best...
21) 22) dialog: Hook your thumb, wrap your wrist, your knuckles, then back to your thumb. Cross over, wrap your knuckles again, and tie it off at the wrist. You do your right. Delilah gives it a shot. She doesn't use enough tension, the wrap droops from her hand.

21) 36) dialog: Mind your own business. (to Delilah) Wait 'til the bag swings back before ya hit it again. Make it work for you, not the other way around.
21) 38) dialog: Good. But don't get so pissed off. Clean out your ears, cuz this is important. A boxer who goes in mad, comes out hurt. Ten times out of ten. Boxing's about discipline. This ain't the WF.
21) 40) dialog: Forget I said it. It's all about control. Control, and skill. That builds discipline. Capeesh? Delilah's eyes GLOW with the last word. She unleashes a diabolical flurry of punches on the heavy bag. Everyone stops and gawks at Delilah's demonstration. Except Slice.
