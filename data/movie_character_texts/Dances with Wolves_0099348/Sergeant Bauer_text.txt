We hold on one man, an enlisted soldier, SERGEANT PEPPER. chances to glance behind and squints at a strange sight. A solitary officer is standing a few feet behind him. The sun is at his back, giving him a ghostly feel. Eerily he  takes a step or two forward. He's limping badly. The sergeant recognizes him. It's Dunbar.

Lieutenant Dunbar is not watching the enemy. He's looking some horses picketed in the trees behind the union lines. There's a nice bay. There's a big roan.
5) 18) text: Dunbar is still watching the horses. He's holding on a sm well-muscled buckskin standing a little apart from the ot CISCO. Now he moves away from the wall, heading for the horses. The sergeant squeezes off a shot. Squinting across the fi he sees a rifle with a hat on the tip of its bayonet wavi at him disrespectfully. The sergeant rolls on his side to reload. He keeps on talking to the lieutenant, but the  lieutenant is gone.

We can hear the distant sounds of work and life coming from the outside but in he it's strangely quiet. A SERGEANT sits at a desk in the foyer. Across the way, a another desk, is an enlisted CLERK. Both men glance from  their paperwork at the man in the doorway. But it's only glance and they go right on shuffling paper. Footfalls sound in a hallway and a blue-eyed officer with slick, black hair swings into the foyer. He too has a  slackness that echoes the dreariness of this post. The blue-eyed officer, LIEUTENANT ELGIN, and Dunbar meet the doorway. Dunbar glances down at a scrap of paper in h hand.

Blood still seeps from a long spli of the skin along his cheek. He groans. Voice are playing about his ears, the voices o white men. He opens his eyes. A bearish, bearded SERGEANT BAUER, is squatting directly front of him. Behind the sergeant, peering over the crumb walls like visitors at a zoo, are a crowd of ordinary  soldiers.

The men  gathered around the supply house murmur among themselves, commenting on the prisoner. They can't take their eyes of him. Neither can Sergeant Bauer. He watches the prisoner  from a distance. Then he walks across the floor, squats i front of him and whispers coarsely in his face.

Crashing through the thicket, he comes to a clearing and  there in the shallows, comes face to face with Smiles A L The boy is standing in the shallows holding the extra hor The boy is so frightened at the sudden sight of this whit soldier that he doesn't move. Bauer sticks his revolver i Smiles A Lot's face and pulls the trigger. But the hammer only clicks. The gun is empty. Bauer pistol-whips the boy, knocking him to the ground an grabs for the closest of the horses. But the ponies are a stirred up now and starting to run down the river. Bauer succeeds in grabbing a hunk of mane, but the horse  he's gotten hold of is moving too fast for him to get on. But now Bauer hears a bone-chilling whoop. Wind In His Ha is coming. His pony plows through the water at full speed. A skullcr dangles from one hand. The warrior begins to whirl it aro Terrified, Bauer turns to run. Before he can take a step, hatchet buries itself to the hilt. Smiles A Lot is at the other end. But Bauer is not through. His hands are around the boy's neck, choking him with his last seconds of life. A larger than life Wind In His Hair draws even and swings his club. Bauer's head explodes,  covering Smiles A Lot in blood -- the sergeant's hands ca be seen.
