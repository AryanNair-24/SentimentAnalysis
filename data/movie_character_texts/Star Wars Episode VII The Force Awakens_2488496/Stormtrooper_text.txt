From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDI WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the ot side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the wh pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET. At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, reveal HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside. TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP O STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation.

Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, a the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappeari over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue. WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk of not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her. But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, w She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch behind her.
