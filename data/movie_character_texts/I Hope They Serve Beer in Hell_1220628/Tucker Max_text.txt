75) 11) text: (into the mic) Some of you may not know me, my name is Tucker Max. Jeff is my best friend. Or at least was, until last week when I took advantage of his kindness and loyalty. I forced him into lying to Kristy, dragged him two hours away, got him abusively drunk, and then ditched him to sleep with a midget stripper. I am the reason that, on the most important day of his life, Jeff's face looks like a melted Barbie doll's. Kristy’s mother is nearly apoplectic. Jeff, holding back building fury, scoots his chair out to get up, but Kristy puts her hand on his leg to stop him and keep him seated.
75) 12) dialog: The worst part is that I didn't know I was doing anything wrong. I was just doing what I’ve always done; which is pretty much whatever the hell I want.

Tucker turns to look at Jeff and Kristy with real sinceri choking up a little.
77) 2) dialog: Jeff, Kristy, I hope you can accept my sincere apology. When I came to your hotel room last night to say sorry, I honestly didn't understand what I was apologizing for. But over the past 24 hours, it's hit me like, well, like ten pounds of slippery shit. I've been a horrible friend. And even though I probably don't deserve to have either of you in my life, I had to come here to tell you that and to ask you for your forgiveness.
77) 4) dialog: I know this will probably scare the crap out of most of you, but I hope to have kids someday. I am sure I will only have daughters, and they will all be vicious sluts who sleep with assholes just like me and then throw it in my face. But such is karma. If one is a boy, though, I will consider myself a huge success as a father if he grows up to be half the man that Jeff Smith is right now. ANGLE ON the room.
