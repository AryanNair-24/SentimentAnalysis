2) 358) dialog: What are you doing?
3) 18) dialog: (partially to himself) The flow of adrenaline is keeping you alive.
3) 22) dialog: Listen, Chev - you have to keep moving.
3) 26) dialog: If I'm right, they gave you the Beijing Cocktail... very nasty ... works on your adrenal gland, blocking your receptors. The only way to slow it down is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant.
3) 31) dialog: Meaning: if you stop, you die.
3) 35) dialog: If you stop, you die.

5) 251) dialog: Relax. I mean don't relax. Listen to me. The shit they gave you is cutting off your adrenaline.
5) 270) text: DOC MILES (O.S.) You've got to get to an emergency room and get yourself some epinephrine ... it's artificial adrenaline ... it comes in 10 milligram syringes ... the shit's potent so don't overdo it ... probably a fifth of an injection will do.

7) 9) dialog: You took it?
7) 13) dialog: You shot the whole thing, didn't you?
7) 22) text: DOC MILES Oh boy. I said a fifth of a syringe, you idiot. Now you're dead for sure.
7) 24) text: DOC MILES Chest is on fire.
7) 26) text: DOC MILES But you're cold.
7) 28) text: DOC MILES You got a steel hard on.
7) 32) text: DOC MILES (getting into it) That's the stimulation of the blood vessels ... your urinary sphincter is tight as a knot ... couldn't pee to save your life ...
7) 35) text: DOC MILES Maybe you can get a hold of some vicadin ... you still at the hospital?
7) 59) text: DOC MILES Maybe some weed ... I don't know ...
7) 62) text: DOC MILES Well, that shit should be out of your system in a half hour or so, if you live that long ... this air phone is costing me a fortune ... look, I'll be in LA in twenty minutes. I'll call you when I hit the ground.

21) 76) text: DOC MILES Oh, I also gave you a little meth. That's the endorphins rushing into to your brain that you're feeling.
21) 78) text: DOC MILES Fuck no. You're in such shit shape it's stunning. I've never seen a heart take this kind of punishment and keep ticking. You should be in a fucking medical journal or something.
21) 81) text: DOC MILES The solution I'm giving you is acting as a competitive inhibitor... meaning it pushes the poison out of your receptors and replaces it with a chemical... it's a temporary fix...
21) 102) text: DOC MILES Look, if we put you on life support we could maybe string you out for a few days, but at some point you'd almost certainly lapse into a coma... and then...
22) 8) text: DOC MILES f you want, I can load you up with something, you'll go out in a beautiful dream.
22) 11) text: DOC MILES (gently) Can I do that for you, Chev?
22) 13) text: DOC MILES Then ... what?
22) 20) text: CHEV'S moment of weakness passes. His face goes grim with vengeance as the mean bastard inside him kicks in. He loo DOC MILES in the eye.
22) 23) text: DOC MILES regards him blankly.
