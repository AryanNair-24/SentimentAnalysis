4) 6) dialog: At least your nightmare is only a  dream. What about what happened to  Leo Marvin?
4) 8) dialog: You never heard of the famous Dr.  Marvin?
4) 10) dialog: That used to be his vacation house.
4) 13) dialog: Grab a strong drink and some  Dramamine. I'll tell you a story  that will send you into Rorschach.
4) 15) dialog: Well, I really can't tell you about  Leo Marvin unless I first tell you  about Bob.
5) 4) dialog: No! (sighs) If you must.
6) 29) dialog: All that changed.
6) 31) dialog: That's what I'm trying to tell you  lummoxes: Bob.
45) 37) dialog: He's under a lot of stress, Fay. His  book, his interview which frankly  didn't go so well, his birthday.  That's a lot to bite off all at once.  I'll give him a sedative and he'll  be fine.
45) 39) text: Phil puts a hand on Fay's hand and nods.
45) 62) dialog: That should give you some interesting  ideas for your next book. You might  even wake up feeling happy.
45) 64) dialog: Carswell Fensterwald? Sure. Who could  forget?
45) 66) dialog: You're joking.
45) 68) dialog: Relax, Leo. I just can't believe  you'd block something like that out.  Carswell was at Harvard with us. You  turned him in for cheating.

52) 38) dialog: And they took him away.
52) 41) dialog: Leo was taken to the Tomsky Institute  for a few days for observation. He  lost his medical license, of course.  A doctor can't try to kill one of  his patients and expect to get away  with it.
52) 43) dialog: Leo was returned to his family.
52) 45) dialog: Bob and the family rented a lakeside  cottage where they could help Leo  recuperate.
52) 82) dialog: Leo Marvin now makes toothbrushes.
52) 84) dialog: The irony, of course, is that Bob  brought the family closer than they'd  ever been before. Harvey Green saw  Leo last month and said he never  looked happier.
53) 6) dialog: Bob married Lily and had triplets.  He went back to school, got a degree  in marriage-family-counseling, and  now has a big practice on Park and  75th.
54) 2) dialog: That's exactly what I'm telling you.
54) 3) text: A BIG HOUSE BOAT goes by. Phil yells to it.
54) 4) dialog: Hey Bob! Hello, BOB!!
54) 9) dialog: Exactly. Sold 2 million copies.
