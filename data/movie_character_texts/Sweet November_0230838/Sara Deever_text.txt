14) 5) dialog: Can you just pass me the Columbo...
14) 7) dialog: The salami... under your chair.
15) 6) dialog: What? You wonder why? What?
15) 8) dialog: Me?
15) 10) dialog: But I was just trying to tell him to stop... She's too ethical to rat, too annoyed to let him off the hook.
15) 11) dialog: «+. talking to me.
15) 14) dialog: What?! 30 days! That's a long time -- that's so unfair! I wasn't doing anything -- The immovable Proctor grimly shakes his head, points to door. Steaming, Sara returns to her desk. Gathering her things, she glares balefully at Nelson, who pretends not to notice. 15 4/5/00 10.
16) 4) dialog: How'd the test go? Hope you passed. He ignores her for a moment, something has caught his eye -- a beaten-up van with yapping dogs painted on it and the words: "BARKING MAD DOG GROOMERS AND DAY CARE. Sanity in a dog-eat-dog world.’ It is parked next to his Mercedes.
16) 7) dialog: Congratulations, you can read. She keeps sitting on his hood, staring at him.
16) 10) dialog: Can you help me? (CONTINUED)
16) 15) dialog: This must be your car.
16) 18) dialog: Is this quest for redemption coming from true remorse, or are you just worried that my sitting on your car will leave a big dent?
16) 20) dialog: That's what I thought. There's a flicker of recognition in her eyes, as if she has confirmed something in her own mind. He gestures to her -- get up. She doesn't budge. Annoyed, he reaches in his wallet and shoves a hundred dollar bill at her.
16) 21) dialog: What are you doing?
16) 25) dialog: (refuses money) Oh, redemption's not for sale today.
17) 7) dialog: (over intercom) Give me that thing.
17) 9) dialog: Hey, big spender, come down here. I can't stop thinking about you. Nelson's bewildered, and intrigued. Checks his watch, mutters:
18) 0) text: In sweats, Nelson comes out of the elevator. Sara is busy listening to a besotted MANNY tell her his whole life story.
18) 2) dialog: Look at that, Manny. My very own Prince Charming. (to Nelson) I don't think I've ever met such a royal asshole in my whole life. Nelson stops in his tracks, staggered. She is off ona toot. (CONTINUED)
18) 5) dialog: Does your mother know you treat women like hookers? Or did she raise you to think being nice means patronizing the whole world?
19) 0) text: Nelson and Sara face off in the street.
19) 2) dialog: I'm smart. (pauses ) And I need a ride.
19) 4) dialog: Yep. Face it, it's your fault I can't drive. The least you can do is schlep me somewhere. It's quick, painless --
19) 7) dialog: Don't make me go too far. (CONTINUED)
19) 10) dialog: Maybe you can help? This man -- he's your neighbor, right -- has been standing naked in his window flashing his ass at me and I want him to stop --
19) 12) dialog: Hi, how are you? We've got a case of vodka and a bathtub full of fudge upstairs, would you like to join us?
19) 14) dialog: Great. Go ahead. I love the police.
20) 0) text: The picture of displeasure, Nelson drives. Sara checks out the luxe car, the leather, the lights on dash. Not impressed.
20) 1) dialog: By the way, my name's Sara Deever. (points) Okay, get in the right lane, put your turn signal on --
20) 3) dialog: You want to take the 80 to Oakland -- (CONTINUED)
20) 7) dialog: I said it would be painless, too. Then, she flashes a warm, disarming smile, full of charm -- completely throwing him yet again.
20) 8) dialog: It's so nice of you to do this for me, Nelson. Sorry if I went too far, but I really did need the ride.
22) 0) text: Sara pulls a flaming red wig out of her bag and puts it on. Nelson is not amused.
22) 2) dialog: Commit a heinous crime. You'll wait, won't you? Sara snatches the keys out of the ignition.
22) 3) dialog: Of course you will. She climbs out. Nelson bangs his head against the steering wheel.
23) 0) text: Sara approaches the building. She goes in. Moments later, an ALARM BLARES. 23 24 25 26 27 4/5/00 17.
25) 0) text: Carrying lumpy sacks, Sara flees the building.
26) 0) text: Sara jumps in and jams the keys in the ignition.
26) 1) dialog: Go! Go! Go! Nelson is so frightened, he obeys her and FIRES UP the CAR.
28) 1) dialog: Don't you feel like Bonnie and Clyde?
28) 3) dialog: Will you relax? They're just... To Nelson's amazement, Sara removes two squirming Jack Russell puppies from the bag.
28) 4) dialog: .+. some fine furry friends. (kisses puppies) Somebody was gonna slice open your little heads and do nasty experiments on your brains, weren't they? She lets them go as the car stops for a light. Nelson lashes out, furious. (CONTINUED)
28) 11) dialog: Not cool enough for you? Better if we whacked a few people while we were at it? (points to traffic light) You can go on green in California.
30) 0) text: The puppies tumble on the ground, Sara crouched on her knees plays with them as Nelson fills his tank with gas. Down the street he sees a police car scanning the block, its searchlight raking the buildings. His eyes light up.
30) 2) dialog: You're not gonna tell them. The car is coming closer, Nelson nods, excited.
30) 4) dialog: (holds her ground) Oh no, you won't, I have a hunch about you. (CONTINUED)
30) 7) dialog: See? I knew you weren't as hard- ball as you act. Stone-faced, Nelson admits nothing. Keeps pumping gas.
30) 8) dialog: Hey, I have an idea. Let's take them back to my place and give them names --
30) 10) dialog: What kind of work?
30) 12) dialog: Oh, you mean you convince people they need something completely inessential and blight the landscape in the process.
30) 14) dialog: Is it fun? Do you enjoy it?
30) 16) dialog: So the answer is -- yes? You do. But does it make you happy?
30) 20) dialog: -- Created by advertisers!
30) 22) dialog: So what else makes you miserable, besides your job? Nelson doesn't answer.
30) 23) dialog: What do you do for fun? He doesn't answer, but she acts as if they are conversing
30) 24) dialog: I didn't think so. No hobbies, diversions, kinky obsessions? (as he doesn't answer ) I was afraid of that. What about -- Nelson rams the nozzle back into the pump.
32) 1) dialog: Would you like to come up for a cup of cocoa?
32) 3) dialog: I'll make a deal with you. Come up for one cup, and I'll never ask you for another ride for as long as I live. (CONTINUED)
32) 7) dialog: Okay. See you tomorrow then. Sara starts to get out, but Nelson stops her.
32) 9) dialog: Is eight o'clock good? You, me, Manny the doorman, that whole thing?
33) 0) text: Deliberately chaotic, Sara's loft includes the fire pole from the old station and plants galore. As the puppies carouse in a pen, Sara sets two teacups on the kitchen table, where Nelson is sitting, aware of the fact that she is openly checking him out. He tries to strike a nonchalant pose.
33) 1) dialog: I can help you, Nelson. I have a gift. A special ability to help men with... problems. Thinking this is a seduction tactic, he plays along.
33) 3) dialog: That's usually the first sign. Nelson groans as she sits down across from him, dead serious.
33) 5) dialog: Denial. I think you work too much.
33) 9) dialog: Plenty. You admitted you do nothing else, and it doesn't make you happy. How's that for screwy logic?
33) 11) dialog: No special interests. No pets. You hate dogs --
33) 13) dialog: Cold-blooded doesn't count. You're a walking case study: we've got anger, stress, repression, extreme distraction, egocentricity, and control freakism --
33) 15) dialog: Look at you, you're a workaholic in such an advanced stage that all your intimacy skills have withered away to almost nothing. Left untreated, Nelson, you could become emotionally extinct. Nelson rolls his eyes and drinks his cocoa, checking out her messy loft with a wary look, thinking who is this
33) 17) dialog: You live in a box. I could open the lid, let some light in.
33) 22) dialog: (ignores him) If you want my help, it'll require a commitment on your part. You'll have to live here with me for one month, no more, no less, no work allowed.
33) 25) dialog: You don't have a girlfriend. I mean, you can feel it... there's something intimate a woman leaves on aman. You don't have that.
33) 27) dialog: Well you know what? I feel sorry for Angelica.
33) 29) dialog: October's almost over. We can start midnight on the first of November. If you're brave enough to commit, I will devote myself entirely to you. Nelson gets up.
41) 5) dialog: Did you think about my offer?
41) 7) dialog: What happened to your hand?
41) 9) dialog: May I look at it?
41) 11) dialog: Because I'm a vampire. I know some things about first aid. Nelson warily allows her to examine his hand.
42) 0) text: Sara treats Nelson's hand.
42) 1) dialog: So what'd you do today?
42) 5) dialog: Perfect.
42) 7) dialog: It's November first. Our month to be together.
42) 9) dialog: Very.
42) 11) dialog: Sounds like you already have.
42) 13) dialog: I wouldn't put it that way, but yeah, that's what you should do. Sara removes her sweater, revealing a very persuasive undershirt, and then returns to working on his hand.
42) 15) dialog: Help. Sara stands and starts unbuttoning Nelson's shirt.
42) 17) dialog: Taking your shirt off.
42) 21) dialog: So you can clean up.
42) 23) dialog: Because you smell like puppy piss. Sara takes the shirt to the kitchen.
44) 0) text: Sara sprays the shirt with detergent. She crosses the last day of October off a large wall calendar and then tears the month away, revealing November.
45) 0) text: Cleaned up, Nelson comes from the bathroom, Sara brings him the shirt. Nelson sniffs it and puts it on. They move closer. They kiss. Channeling his desperation, Nelson lifts her onto the bed, spins her down and pulls at her clothes.
45) 1) dialog: Wait, Nelson, stop... stop. Sara pushes him back. (CONTINUED)
45) 5) dialog: Look at me. Gently. Slowly. He starts in just as aggressively, and again she stops him.
45) 6) dialog: Nelson, what are you doing?
45) 8) dialog: Just take it easy. It doesn't have to be like this. We've got all night. He stares at her for a long moment and then pulls away.
46) 0) text: Pouring rain. Wearing his suit with no shirt, Nelson storms out the door. Sara follows pulling her sweater on.
46) 1) dialog: Nelson, wait a second! Would you stop for one second? He keeps going. A few pedestrians gawk, but most keep going. Nelson pulls Sara aside.
46) 3) dialog: What are you so pissed off about?! (CONTINUED)
46) 7) dialog: Please come back. I won't tell you what to do. We don't even have to do anything. Just don't go. For a moment, Nelson's guard drops and his face betrays how weary and shattered he is by the events of the day. She slips inside the opening in the crack.
46) 8) dialog: Tell me what you want me to do, Nelson, and I'll do it. Tell me.
47) 0) text: Sitting on the bed, Nelson stares intently at Sara, standing in front of him.
47) 3) dialog: Would you like to be my November, Nelson?
49) 0) text: Alone in bed, Nelson is sound asleep, jerks bolt upright screaming -- a cross-eyed cat is gnawing at his toes. He grabs the cat by the scruff of neck, ready to hurl it, then guiltily peeks to see if Sara's around, muttering:
53) 0) text: Sara enters the loft.
53) 5) dialog: Stop what you're doing right now!
53) 7) dialog: Because it's the same boring thing you do every day and you can't do that with me.
53) 9) dialog: Of course it doesn't work, it's a planter. (CONTINUED)
53) 13) dialog: I gave them away.
53) 15) dialog: Don't worry, I got you these -- She throws a pair of jeans and sweatshirt at him. The insane CAT streaks past, SCREECHING. Nelson almost trips on it.
53) 16) dialog: Poor Sasquatch. Catnip overdose.
53) 18) dialog: Clothes are clothes. All they do is cover up a body.
53) 20) dialog: Ernie, you're gonna stay with me for a while until I find you some decent parents. (turns back to Nelson) When do I get to meet your parents? He stalks toward her, eyes burning.
53) 26) dialog: I'm sorry.
53) 28) dialog: I told you, I gave them away. I'll never lie to you. Too defeated to fight, Nelson throws on the jeans and sweatshirt. The jeans are about four inches too short. As he is getting dressed, CHAS (30) shambles through the door, looks exhausted.
53) 33) dialog: His name is Nelson.
54) 0) text: Nelson exits the loft, and Sara follows.
54) 1) dialog: -- Nelson, I told you helping men is my gift.
54) 3) dialog: Chas lives upstairs. We look after each other.
54) 5) dialog: Everyone needs looking after, Nelson.
55) 1) dialog: Hey, guys, this is Nelson. But Nelson's off, without saying a word to them. Sara barrels after him. (CONTINUED)
55) 4) dialog: That was so rude! Al and Osiris are great! They were close personal friends of Jack Kerouac !--
55) 7) dialog: Okay, now you're just being greedy, Bruce. I already gave you those clothes. Nelson puts a brake on, gasps.
55) 9) dialog: Doesn't it feel good to give?
55) 18) dialog: Nelson, this is a great kid, you've got to meet him. Abner. He wants to set a world record. What's today's project, Abner?
55) 23) dialog: That's pathetic -- you let a ten-year-old wind you up?
55) 25) dialog: Would you prefer I was a virgin?
55) 27) dialog: That tender tender male ego is bruised, isn't it? (sweetly, tenderly) I'm yours, Nelson Moss. All yours. That sends alarms ringing in his confirmed bachelor's brain. (CONTINUED)
55) 33) dialog: You are the most egotistical lunkhead I've ever met! (settles down) It's one month, Nelson. Get it? Now he's insulted. And amazed. He's never been treated this way before. To save face, he acts tough.
55) 35) dialog: Okay. How long can you put your big fat lucrative career on hold to try this thing out? Wait a minute -- you're unemployed --
55) 38) dialog: I have my reasons. (CONTINUED)
55) 42) dialog: Only if you give me what I want.
55) 44) dialog: Time.
56) 0) text: Sara's Barking Mad Dog Day Care van is parked outside a ritzy building.
57) 0) text: Nelson stands stiffly behind Sara, who gestures expansively toward a rail-thin Nancy Kissinger-style SOCIETY MATRON.
57) 1) dialog: -- Nelson's helping me today. He loves dogs. Sitting on the sofa, floor, chairs, posed like perfect little stuffed animals, are Society Lady's six beloved dogs. Immaculately groomed, heads daintily cocked, front paws folded over each other -- they are glaring coldly at Nelson. Sara pats their heads as she clips leashes on them.
57) 2) dialog: And these are the best behaved doggies in the whole wide world, aren't they? So elegant, so dignified. Just like their mommy.
58) 0) text: Extremely put out, Nelson walks beside Sara -- each holds three dogs on leashes as they head up a path. The dogs don't pull or tug, prance with military precision.
58) 2) dialog: I don't do it for the money. (shouts to dogs) Okay, guys, ready to be bad? All six tails begin to wag in furious unison. Incredulous, Nelson watches Sara unclip all the dogs from leashes and swat them on the rump.
58) 3) dialog: Raise some hell, fellas, and don't tell Mommy! Suddenly, nothing short of pure canine bedlam is unleashed. The six prissy DOGS go insane -- race up the green, YIPPING and HOWLING, fighting with each other, rolling in the dirt, scrambling through mud puddles, BARKING at babies. Overjoyed, Sara runs with the pack, clapping her hands and shouting.
58) 4) dialog: Bad dogs! Bad dogs! I'm so proud of you! Nelson rolls his eyes, checks his watch. Lurches back when a wet, muddy pooch shakes all over him.
58) 6) dialog: Be nice to Winston -- he's insecure -- needs a lot of affection.
58) 11) dialog: Winston! That's enough! Come here, boy! Winston comes running to her, throws himself on the ground and lets her rub his back. Sara looks up to see Nelson storming off the green.
59) 0) text: The van is parked near a hose. Nelson sits glumly in driver's seat. Outside, Sara hoses off all the filthy dogs.
60) 0) text: Nelson checks his watch again. Peers at Sara in the side mirror.
60) 3) dialog: Look at them -- aren't they incredible? The dogs are soaking wet, shivering, waiting patiently for Sara to tell them what to do next.
61) 0) text: Trying to be a good sport, Nelson awkwardly helps Sara to dry the dogs with hair driers. Winston starts to make a move toward Nelson. (CONTINUED )
62) 0) text: Sara is licking an ice cream cone, counting money as she waits for Nelson to make up his mind about his order. Her van is parked nearby.
62) 1) dialog: Thirty bucks, not bad for a few hours work. Nelson's tempted to say something glib, but bites his tongue. However, he can't help but register a look of pity mixed with horror at how pathetic the earnings are.
62) 3) dialog: Tell me something. When was the last time you spent the whole day outdoors?
62) 6) dialog: Anything.
62) 11) dialog: These things take time. You don't have time.
62) 15) dialog: I used to own that company, Divine Pets. Nelson cracks up, her timing as usual is brilliant.
62) 17) dialog: I did. But after a while it wasn't fun anymore. So I quit.
62) 19) dialog: Oh, I never did that. 64 4/5/00 51.
63) 0) text: Nelson stands there somewhat bemused as Sara comes forwar with a scarf, smiling.
63) 1) dialog: This will be good for you... She starts to blindfold him with the scarf.
63) 2) dialog: ... Sharpen your instincts. He laughs, oh goody a sex game, tries to grab her.
63) 3) dialog: Not those instincts. Okay, this is the object -- (as he grabs her again) Stop it -- I run around so you lose track of where I am. (as he's pushing the scarf down) Don't do that, leave it on -- count to ten and try to find me. She secures the blindfold and races off. He pauses for a moment, then:
63) 6) dialog: Oh my God, you're really bad, you didn't even get close.
63) 11) dialog: Yep. You told me. And you're a man of your word.
63) 13) dialog: That's me. Just... crazy. (sweetly) What are you more afraid of? Spending two consecutive nights with a woman? Or discovering this whole thing might not be as crazy as you think? He is flummoxed for a moment.
63) 15) dialog: Good. He covertly checks the time.
63) 17) dialog: Stay for dinner. I have your favorite.
63) 19) dialog: Yes, I do. (CONTINUED)
63) 23) dialog: Lean steak, no fat? Her sweetness and sincerity get through, even to him.
63) 24) dialog: Go on, stay for dinner, then you're free to go. No strings attached.
64) 0) text: Nelson and Sara have dinner on a plant-covered deck, lit by strings of cheap lights. Ernie is begging at Nelson's feet.
64) 1) dialog: Mitch was my October. He was the shyest man I ever met. We focused on confidence building.
64) 3) dialog: My treatment was a little too effective. We had to terminate the month early.
64) 5) dialog: There was no September. Nelson feigns disbelief.
64) 6) dialog: I'm not a weirdo about it.
64) 8) dialog: Paul was so sad.
64) 12) dialog: Now he's gay.
64) 14) dialog: Gay gay but very happy about it. Nelson has to ask:
64) 16) dialog: Does it really matter? She flashes the most beguiling smile.
64) 19) dialog: Long enough to be meaningful. Short enough to stay out of trouble.
64) 21) dialog: Good. The sound of a MAN LAUGHING drifts over from another porch.
64) 22) dialog: Listen... do you hear that? What a wonderful laugh. (CONTINUED)
64) 25) dialog: Doesn't life just... take your breath away? Once again, he finds himself so moved by her, he is wordless. There is a long silence between them.
64) 26) dialog: What's your secret dream, Nelson?
64) 28) dialog: Come on, everyone's got one. He listens to the SOUNDS, and takes a leap -- lets himself open up for a moment.
64) 30) dialog: Where did you live?
64) 32) dialog: You thought it would make him happy? (CONTINUED)
64) 38) dialog: I'd like to hear you sing sometime.
64) 40) dialog: I'd like you to do something else for me, before you leave tonight.
64) 42) dialog: Do the dishes. I hate doing dishes.
65) 0) text: Nelson is washing the dishes. Sara sits on the floor, letting Ernie teethe by nipping her hand the way puppies love to do.
65) 1) dialog: So, what will you do when you go home?
65) 3) dialog: I know. You'll turn on the TV. Get bored. Turn on your computer. Check out your work. Get bored. Surf the net. Get bored. (softly) And think of me. She stands up and leaves the kitchen. He seems torn, debates with himself as he finishes the dishes. Turns to see Sara removing the last bit of her clothes before slipping into bed.
65) 4) dialog: I'm making this as difficult as I possibly can. Nelson stares, his determination quickly waning. 67 68 69 4/5/00 57.
66) 0) text: Raining. Nelson lies awake, studying Sara as rainy reflections of streetlights roll over her. Rising, he quietly dresses.
68) 0) text: Bathed in sunlight, Sara sleeps under a pile of blankets. Nelson tiptoes into the loft, carrying a travel bag. As he approaches the bed, ERNIE GROWLS dementedly, ready to pounce. Nelson points a finger, is amazed when ERNIE STOPS GROWLING, THUMPS HIS TAIL ON FLOOR, awakening Sara. Overjoyed to see Nelson, Sara beckons him. Nelson slides into bed, kisses her.
69) 0) text: Nelson, wearing floral boxers, examines Sara's bathroom, frowning at the cast-iron tub. She is washing her face.
70) 1) dialog: See? That's not so bad, is it? (points) Can you grab some more soap? Reaching up to get the soap, he tries a cupboard door, surprised to find it locked.
70) 4) dialog: It is not my web site. Not my anything, anymore.
70) 6) dialog: It started out small. And it got big.
70) 10) dialog: Everything got big. Desires. Pressures. Lives. Egos. I didn't like the big me. Nota good person. Not happy. And the amazing part is, I got out before it got really big, can you imagine.
70) 13) dialog: Hazelnut. You don't like it?
70) 20) dialog: Stop it! We have important things to do today...
71) 0) text: Nelson and Sara stand in a rail car crowded with commuters. As the car jostles and bodies bump up against him, Nelson squirms with discomfort.
71) 2) dialog: Because I make the rules, Nelson. Rules you must submit to, utterly and completely.
71) 4) dialog: Kinky. Maybe even strangely arousing. But if we took a cab, we'd miss out on all this.
71) 6) dialog: You know what this train is, Nelson?
71) 8) dialog: It's 55 lives. All happening at once, in the exact same place, at the exact same time. Imagine how much hope and lust and fear and love are in this car, right now, at this very moment. Look around. (CONTINUED)
71) 12) dialog: I dare you. Look at someone, anyone. That woman by the door. A woman in her early 40s stands near one of the doors, her head leaning against the window as she stares out at the passing city with a distant, detached expression.
71) 13) dialog: What do you see?
71) 15) dialog: I think she's a mother. I think she loves her family so much it hurts. I think she'd throw herself in front of this train for them if she had to. And I think when she gets into bed at night, she makes love to her husband like he was the king of Egypt. As Sara enjoys the fruit of her imagination, Nelson reconsiders the woman, this time seriously.
71) 17) dialog: Maybe. Maybe it's worse. Maybe nothing about life even makes sense to her anymore. Maybe some days she wishes she could just quit pretending and end the whole goddamn thing. (CONTINUED)
71) 20) dialog: You want to go to the dark side, Nelson? I can get there faster than you can. Believe me. Looking away, Sara takes a deep breath and then smiles again, as irrepressible as she was just moments before.
71) 21) dialog: But what for? We see the world we choose to see. And I think my first choice was a helluva lot more fun, don't you? As the train jostles and jerks, Nelson and Sara search each other's eyes.
72) 0) text: Hurrying down the pier, Sara waves when she spots Abner waiting patiently, holding a paper bag.
72) 1) dialog: There you are! Abner approaches, removing his balaclava. He's a cute kid, just shy and awkward. Nelson wants to make up for yesterday.
72) 3) dialog: Cell phones are outlawed in my world.
74) 0) text: Nelson steps away, sits on a nearby piling as Sara and Abner head toward the cluster of kids.
75) 0) text: Nelson and Sara stand outside Abner's little house, watching him unlock the door. Before stepping in he waves to them.
75) 4) dialog: Sometimes a good idea is not a good idea, know what I mean? They start to cross the street toward her building.
75) 6) dialog: Yeah, you're a father figure now.
75) 8) dialog: You're a man. When you don't know who your father is, you're not very picky about your role models. She stops, stunned. A Circuit City man is standing outside her building with a big box.
75) 9) dialog: What's that?
75) 11) dialog: That's not a ‘little present' for me, it's a ‘little present’ for you. (sweetly, but firmly, to Circuit City man) Take it back. Better yet, you keep it. I never watch TV. She unlocks the door and leaves Nelson stunned outside.
76) 0) text: Carrying a bottle of wine, Nelson trudges up the steps with Sara, feeling very put out.
76) 1) dialog: Stop pouting, we promised Chas Cherry we'd come. (CONTINUED)
76) 5) dialog: You have a one-track mind, Nelson Moss. Trust me, you won't be bored. Chas Cherry's a great cook.
77) 1) dialog: That was Chas. This is Cherry. Chas extends a manicured hand, Nelson is trying his harde to go along with it, forcing himself to be hip, ebullient
77) 4) dialog: That was Brandon. This is Brandy.
78) 6) dialog: Who ate them? The dog?
78) 9) dialog: I meant to tell you, Cherry, I'm sorry I meant Chas, works in advertising, too.
78) 19) dialog: Hello? Nelson points an accusatory finger at Sara.

79) 10) dialog: But this is your month, not mine. She sees how mad he's getting, leans in and kisses him.
79) 11) dialog: Never go to bed angry. Aroused by the kiss, Nelson prolongs it, unzips her dress, slips his hand inside, caresses her back. Is surprised to feel her stiffen under his hands. He backs away, studies her. He sees what she's trying to hide.

81) 15) dialog: God, that is one of the most astute observations about female behavior I've ever heard. Are you a psychologist?
81) 17) dialog: Hey, Lexy.
81) 28) dialog: He seemed okay.
81) 30) dialog: Do you always talk about your friends that way?
81) 32) dialog: (pauses, doesn't indulge him) So what is it? Some kind of boy's club, work friendship?
81) 34) dialog: Do you trust him? Isn't that what friends are for? Nelson shrugs, then nods, then shakes his head, then nods and shrugs again. She cracks up. He's unaware he's doing it.

81) 37) dialog: In a scary situation, let's say. (CONTINUED)
81) 41) dialog: (the sweetest smile) Do you trust me? Aware of what he's doing now, Nelson shrugs, shakes his head, nods. She hits him with a look.
81) 42) dialog: Show me the house where you grew up.
83) 1) dialog: It's just a house, Nelson. He takes a deep breath, still balking, then gives in. Holding Sara's hand, he enters and slowly wanders through the empty living room... memories, images, and sounds washing over him. He is silent for a long time, then:

89) 7) dialog: Why is going to some pow-wow with that slicko Vince such a big deal?
89) 9) dialog: Well, if it's a whole lifetime, just postpone it for one more week.
89) 11) dialog: I hate it. I threw it out. OFF Nelson's look, Sara produces his cell phone and slams it down on the table in front of him.
89) 12) dialog: What if the Great One hires you to start tomorrow?
89) 16) dialog: That would ruin everything -- we haven't finished! You haven't sung for me yet. You promised you would. Nelson pours a huge coffee.

101) 5) dialog: Nothing.
101) 9) dialog: I'm fine. So, what's the big announcement?

101) 12) dialog: So, come on, what's your big announcement?
101) 14) dialog: Technically, shouldn't that be a question?
101) 16) dialog: Are you insane?
101) 18) dialog: That's incredibly sweet, but you don't understand...
101) 24) dialog: You're forgetting something. Sara moves to the refrigerator to gather more vegetables.
101) 26) dialog: We made a deal, remember? One month. That's it.
101) 28) dialog: Well then this is a really big breakthrough for you -- you can finally say things that you could never say before.

Gathering a last surge, she angrily rips the shelves from the cabinet, sending scores of bottles rolling around the (CONTINUED)
102) 5) dialog: There. Is that enough truth for you?! Are you happy now? Sara hurls bottle after bottle at Nelson. He stands there dumbly, lets them bounce off him.
102) 6) dialog: You just couldn't leave it alone, could you?! You just had to know! She turns to leave -- her body literally collapses and she starts to crash to the floor. Nelson grabs her, she is limp in his arms. He gently lies her down, panicking as she grows increasingly faint.

106) 6) dialog: Look at us, look at you. You probably think I'll break if you touch me, I'll crumble if you say one harsh word. You measure every step, every thought... (pauses ) That's not how I want you to be. He leans forward, takes her hand and kisses it.
106) 8) dialog: Oh God, Nelson. If anyone could, it's you. She runs her fingers through his hair. They are silent a few beats.
106) 9) dialog: Will you help me do something?

115) 14) dialog: Both of us. Besides it's a moot point. He's gone. She leans down to pick up the broken muffins strewn all over the floor.
115) 16) dialog: I don't want him to come back. Look what I did to the muffins. She's becoming unraveled, has to keep the subject changed.
115) 17) dialog: Maybe I can salvage a few of these...
115) 19) dialog: Where's the mix? I'll start again --
115) 24) dialog: Stop it, would you? She spins around to face him, eyes glittering.
115) 25) dialog: What rule says I should put him through hell? All it will do is hurt him.
