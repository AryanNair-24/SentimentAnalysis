2) 1) dialog: That was good... Ambivalent, Angelica watches as Nelson enters the bathroom.

5) 0) text: The penthouse is orderly and stark. Entering, Nelson grabs an incoming fax, turns on a coffeemaker and picks up a remote control. Ignoring a stunning view of the city, he closes the blinds and turns ON FIVE TELEVISIONS. 4/5/00 2.

6) 3) dialog: Vince?
6) 5) dialog: (into phone) Yeah, looking good. (to Angelica, fake innocent) Talk about what? He sees the look on her face, turns his head, rolls his eyes and mouths "us" as she says:
6) 8) dialog: Almost. Meet you in twenty.
7) 3) dialog: Us. Right. Hey -- isn't there some kinda limit on 'us' talks? You know, one okay, two if necessary, three, cruel and unusual. He flashes a smile and bolts, evading her once again.

8) 1) dialog: Good dog, great dog...
8) 3) dialog: I can't make it. I'm sorry.
8) 5) dialog: And this account is very important to me. (sees how hurt she is) Come on, it's Doctor Diggety, it's practically an American institution. (stops) Hey -- does that play? American institution --

10) 1) dialog: (over phone) That rule applies to mediocrity. We want perfection.
10) 3) dialog: I worry because worrying about losing keeps you winning. Suddenly aware of themselves, they pocket their phones as an OFFICE MANAGER hands Nelson an advertising award.
10) 9) dialog: Morning, Beatrice.
11) 0) text: A temple of California corporate cool, the place looks like a hip playpen for a kid who never grew up. Nelson immediately settles down to work, furiously typing new copy into his computer as Vince nervously peers over his shoulder to observe the changes, wants to distract him, change subject.
11) 2) dialog: Edgar Price, huh? He's great.
11) 4) dialog: Yeah, well maybe a trillion years from now some guy will say the same about you. If you get off your butt and work on this tag. (CONTINUED)
11) 8) dialog: Sure, chief. Just finessing some --
12) 0) text: Nelson and Vince are walking into an art department.
12) 2) dialog: Make this night.
12) 4) dialog: Give me a bonfire.

12) 11) dialog: Sort of. Reschedule.
12) 13) dialog: So let it expire.
12) 15) dialog: Beatrice, I don't have time for this. Wait till the presentation's over...

16) 1) dialog: Nelson Moss for Vince. Did Rubin tweak the music?
16) 3) dialog: Cut him. Get Johnson McDonald, give him the sample, he'll know what I want. Just then he notices Sara sitting on the hood of his bran new Mercedes, she gives him a jaunty wave.
16) 5) dialog: (into phone) Hey, Vince, what about this? ‘Barking mad for Doctor Diggety. Sanity in a dog-eat-dog world.
16) 8) dialog: (to Vince) Call you back. He hangs up. Slowly walks over to her, not thrilled that she's sitting on his car.
16) 9) dialog: Can I help you?
16) 13) dialog: Yeah. She keeps staring, says nothing. He feels pinned by her gaze, peers around, then points to her van.
16) 14) dialog: Oh -- that must be your van.
16) 16) dialog: And you can't drive? Right, right. This is how you make -- He reaches for his wallet.
16) 17) dialog: Oh, shit, right. Well, how much do you make? Doesn't look like much. I'll cover your expenses -- (reaches for money, decides against it, pulls out business card instead) Here, call my secretary, she'll take care of it -- She takes the card, peers quizzically at it.
16) 19) dialog: The dent, I guess.
16) 22) dialog: Buying redemption. (CONTINUED)
16) 26) dialog: Okay, I guess I'm going to hell. Get off my car. Stunned, she gets off his CAR as he scrambles inside and ROARS out of the lot.
17) 0) text: Nelson works out at an intense pace on an treadmill as he watches all five TV's. Other than shelves of glass vases and ceramics, the only other decor is a fish tank occupied by a lone fish. The MICROWAVE BEEPS, Nelson jumps off mumbling:
17) 1) dialog: What is it? It's a hot dog. It's a hot dog. It's a... Opening the oven, he grabs a hot dog, nearly burns his hand.
17) 2) dialog: It's a hot dog. (eureka) That's right! It's a hot dog! It's a hot dog! He cuts it and jabs a piece on a fork, just as the INTERC BUZZES. As he speaks he stares at the hot dog on fork.
17) 3) dialog: Yeah?
17) 10) dialog: Ten minutes. (presses "talk") Okay. Be right down. As he walks away, he takes a bite of the hot dog on fork and nearly gags before spitting it out.

19) 3) dialog: This is a joke, right? (as she shakes her head) You want a ride -- from me?
19) 5) dialog: I am not a schlepper. Manny knocks on the glass from the inside and holds up a handwritten sign that reads, "You want me call police?" Nelson shakes his head. Turns back to Sara.
19) 6) dialog: Been a ball, but some of us have to work.
19) 11) dialog: Ignore her, please. As the flustered couple scurries inside, Sara stops a young woman on her way out.
19) 13) dialog: Stop it or I'll call the police.
19) 15) dialog: Do you have any shame at all? (pauses ) No.
20) 0) text: The picture of displeasure, Nelson drives. Sara checks out the luxe car, the leather, the lights on dash. Not impressed.

22) 0) text: Sara pulls a flaming red wig out of her bag and puts it on. Nelson is not amused.

28) 10) dialog: Off the leather, off the leather! (trying to compose himself) Let me get this straight. You humiliated me, harassed and exploited me -- just so -- I could help you in some cute save-the- puppy caper? Off the leather!
29) 0) text: The MERCEDES swerves and SCREECHES as Nelson is assaulted by the slobbering pups.
30) 0) text: The puppies tumble on the ground, Sara crouched on her knees plays with them as Nelson fills his tank with gas. Down the street he sees a police car scanning the block, its searchlight raking the buildings. His eyes light up.
30) 1) dialog: Get ready to go to jail, Sara Deever.
30) 3) dialog: Oh yeah. Everything.
30) 9) dialog: Sounds like a million laughs, but I gotta work.
30) 11) dialog: Advertising.
30) 13) dialog: Bingo! That's me!
30) 15) dialog: People tend to enjoy what they're really good at.
30) 17) dialog: Everyone knows happiness is a myth, an extremely powerful myth -- Sara's laugh starts as a snicker, builds to a full-blown howl. (CONTINUED)
30) 21) dialog: Exactly.
30) 25) dialog: Just get in the car.
32) 2) dialog: As scintillating as the evening's been, I'm afraid not. Sara is undeniably sincere and sexy, and even Nelson can' help but be tempted just a little.
32) 6) dialog: No thanks.
32) 8) dialog: Whoa, whoa, whoa -- hold on.
33) 0) text: Deliberately chaotic, Sara's loft includes the fire pole from the old station and plants galore. As the puppies carouse in a pen, Sara sets two teacups on the kitchen table, where Nelson is sitting, aware of the fact that she is openly checking him out. He tries to strike a nonchalant pose.
33) 2) dialog: I don't have problems.
33) 4) dialog: Of what?
33) 6) dialog: Right. What do you know about work? (CONTINUED)
33) 10) dialog: I admitted nothing. I was silent.
33) 12) dialog: Busted! Actually, I do have a pet. A fish. Oscar.
33) 14) dialog: Control freakism is not a word --
33) 16) dialog: Out of sheer, perverse curiosity, how does a lunatic like you help a guy like me?
33) 18) dialog: Wow that's deep. I feel cured already, just hearing about it. (CONTINUED)
33) 23) dialog: You don't even know me, and you're inviting me to move in with you?
33) 24) dialog: How's my girlfriend supposed to feel about that?
33) 26) dialog: Her name's Angelica.
33) 28) dialog: Great, I'll relay that to her when I leave. Which is right about now --
33) 30) dialog: Brave enough, but not stupid enough. (pause) Now listen up, moonbeam. Here's how it works. No more harassment, no more rides, no more extortion. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
33) 33) dialog: Next time you come to my building, I really will call the cops. Bye-bye. He leaves. Frowning, Sara reflects on her failed proposal.
34) 0) text: At the end of a long table, Raeford Dunne sits next to BUDDY LEACH (65). Vince and agency staff fill one side of the table. Leach and the Doctor Diggety brass occupy the other. Leach's face does not betray one emotion as he listens to Nelson's presentation. On the wall, white sheets of paper cover boards underneat Nelson is at the top of his game, a consummate showman. H is so amped up, he's practically throwing off sparks. He holds up a board with an image on it -- a silly looking 50's style hot dog cartoon figure -- Doctor Diggety.
34) 1) dialog: This is your brand image, Mister Leach -- we polled your primary demographic and you know what eighty-nine percent said: boring. Safe. We need to drop a bomb. (dropping the board) We don't want hot dogs safe. (working up a head of steam) What's in a hot dog? Don't tell me! I don't wanna know... He rips down a white sheet of paper to reveal an image of a hot dog engulfed in flames: the hot dog from hell.
34) 2) dialog: They're dangerous! (pauses ) What are we selling here? We're selling temptation -- desire -- animal instincts -- gluttony -- sin. We want to show man as he really is... a savage... he needs fire, he needs food. He hunts and gathers, what does he get? (CONTINUED)
34) 5) dialog: He gets a hot dog! (pauses ) We're pagans, we love our rituals -- our team hits the ball out of the park, we're screaming, we're insane. What do we want? Rips down another sheet of a crowd at baseball game pitch forward screaming like monsters, all holding hot dogs.
34) 6) dialog: We want a hot dog! (pauses ) Let's go straight to your pre-teen demographic. Kids. The little angels. They're not angels. They're monsters. You give them a tuna sandwich. They don't want a tuna sandwich... (cips down another sheet) They want a hot dog! Board showing a little boy glumly holding up a tuna sandwich and an apple, lusting after the hot dog in the hands of a cute girl next to him. Nelson rushes over to another sheet.
34) 7) dialog: We need women. We've got the mothers, we need their daughters. Let's answer that age old question -- what does a woman really want? You know. I know -- (vips sheet exposing another board) She wants a hot dog! He is like some rabid animal, all fired up.
34) 8) dialog: We're hot blooded -- we need sex. We need a sinful, dangerous food. What is it? (rips another sheet) It's a hot dog! It's a hot dog! (CONTINUED)
34) 11) dialog: Doctor Diggety. It's a hot dog. There is a long pause as Nelson catches his breath and everyone in the room turns to Leach to hear his reaction.
34) 13) dialog: (taken aback) No. What do you mean?
34) 15) dialog: I don't understand? What did you ask for? Edge. (points) This is edge. Not even willing to deal with Nelson, Leach turns to Raeford Dunne, as he prepares to leave.
34) 17) dialog: Excuse me. I think you're making a big mistake.
34) 19) dialog: I've seen your sales. You're in trouble. (CONTINUED)
34) 23) dialog: Were. You're a dinosaur. You're flatlining. You're dead meat.
34) 25) dialog: Well that's funny, ‘cause so is your product.
34) 28) dialog: It's mystery meat!
34) 30) dialog: It's toxic waste in a tube! You're killing me! You're killing us!
35) 0) text: Dunne storms in, followed quickly by Nelson.
35) 5) dialog: I know -- can you believe that asshole --
35) 7) dialog: What are you talking about, burn?
35) 9) dialog: Gutter? I'm the best thing this agency's got!
35) 11) dialog: Gutter? I'm the best thing this company's got!
35) 13) dialog: Screw vacation! Give me another account!
35) 17) dialog: Are you threatening me? (laughs manically) That's hilarious. I'm two Clios ahead of the game, Ray, you can't afford to lose me --
35) 19) dialog: Say that again, I don't think I heard you.
36) 0) text: Nelson hurtles through the lobby. Elevator doors open, Vince charges out. THROUGH plate glass window, sees Nelson outside.
37) 0) text: Nelson tries to unlock his door, his hands are shaking so badly he fumbles with the key, labors to breathe.
38) 0) text: The door opens and Nelson enters, instantly deflating. He's very relieved to find Angelica emerging from the bedroom.
38) 1) dialog: God, am I glad to see you.
38) 6) dialog: This is not a good time for this, Angelica.
38) 9) dialog: (panicking) Wait -- please -- whatever I did -- or said, I didn't mean, I'll be better -- She knows he's lying, that's even more humiliating to her.
38) 10) dialog: Please -- don't go.
38) 15) dialog: I'm fine. Blood seeps from a cut on Nelson's hand.
38) 17) dialog: Leave it!
38) 19) dialog: I said leave it! Nelson wraps a towel around his hand. Opening the door, he finds a tattered box. Stamped on the lid: NOVEMBER. The box starts to move. Horrified, Nelson lifts the lid!-- a Jack Russell puppy has a ridiculous-looking Halloween hat tied to its head -- dangling from the hat is a key.
39) 0) text: Nelson storms off the elevator carrying the box with the WHINING PUPPY inside.
39) 1) dialog: Manny! Manny! Gone for the night, Manny has left a Polaroid of himself in costume on a sign that reads, "Manny Say Happy Halloweens!" Activated by Nelson's movements, an electric GOBLIN next to the sign CACKLES demonically.
39) 2) dialog: Shit!
40) 0) text: On the phone, Nelson paces as the hyperactive PUPPY races through the apartment -- sees the fish in the tank and starts madly BARKING. (CONTINUED)
40) 3) dialog: You're a delivery service. You deliver things. (to dog) Stop it! Shut up!
40) 5) dialog: So what you're saying is, if I kill the dog, you'll take it.
41) 0) text: Holding the box, Nelson leans over to talk to a CABBY.
41) 1) dialog: I have an unusual request. But I will pay you two hundred dollars.
41) 3) dialog: Do me a favor. Stay out of my life. Good-bye. She removes the puppy from the box, kisses it, then flashes one of her winning, adorable smiles. (CONTINUED)
41) 6) dialog: The last thing I feel like doing right now is playing the Sara Deever Mad Hatter Game. He puts the box down and moves towards the door.
41) 8) dialog: Nothing.
41) 10) dialog: Why? Ernie has exhausted himself, collapses on the floor.
41) 12) dialog: What are you after? What do you want from me? She leads him to the bathroom as he studies her suspiciously.
42) 0) text: Sara treats Nelson's hand.
42) 2) dialog: What'd I do today? (pauses ) I got fired. (pauses ) They took the company car. (pauses ) And my girlfriend left me. (CONTINUED)
42) 6) dialog: Define ‘perfect.’
42) 8) dialog: You're actually serious about this, aren't you?
42) 10) dialog: You think I'm just gonna drop everything --
42) 12) dialog: -- Live here, and let you mess with my head for a whole month?
42) 14) dialog: So this... whatever you call it --
42) 16) dialog: What are you doing?
42) 18) dialog: Why? (CONTINUED)
42) 22) dialog: Why? Out in the open now, the sexual tension between them intensifies.
43) 0) text: Shirtless, Nelson seems bewildered, can't decide whether to wash up or get out of there -- he catches his reflection in the mirror, studies it for an answer, mutters:
43) 1) dialog: Just for the night. He turns on the water, leans down to wash his face.
45) 0) text: Cleaned up, Nelson comes from the bathroom, Sara brings him the shirt. Nelson sniffs it and puts it on. They move closer. They kiss. Channeling his desperation, Nelson lifts her onto the bed, spins her down and pulls at her clothes.
45) 4) dialog: What?
45) 7) dialog: What does it look like I'm doing?
45) 9) dialog: To hell with the whole goddamn thing. Nelson yanks on his clothes.
46) 0) text: Pouring rain. Wearing his suit with no shirt, Nelson storms out the door. Sara follows pulling her sweater on.
46) 2) dialog: I have no words to describe how totally whacked you are!
46) 6) dialog: This has been the day from hell, and the absolute last thing I need is you telling me what to do in the sack!
47) 0) text: Sitting on the bed, Nelson stares intently at Sara, standing in front of him.
47) 1) dialog: Take that off. Sara pulls her sweater over her head, revealing the same persuasive undershirt he saw earlier.
47) 2) dialog: That, too. Sara removes her shirt. Exposed, she waits for Nelson to make the next move. Gently, he kisses her stomach. As he slowly works his way upward, a swooning Sara grows increasingly breathless.
47) 4) dialog: Yes. Finally letting go, they meet in a deep, sensuous kiss.
49) 0) text: Alone in bed, Nelson is sound asleep, jerks bolt upright screaming -- a cross-eyed cat is gnawing at his toes. He grabs the cat by the scruff of neck, ready to hurl it, then guiltily peeks to see if Sara's around, muttering:
49) 1) dialog: Nice cat... nice kitty... Sara's gone. Nelson abruptly drops the cat -- it streaks across the bed and barrels out to the living area where it is attacked by Ernie, the puppy. Sounds of FURRY FIGHTING ensue. Nelson jumps out, throws on his boxers, momentarily puzzled -- where's the rest of his clothes? Grabs his cell phone and heads over to a TV set surrounded by plants and ferns. He tries to turn it on, it doesn't work. Shrugging, Nelson lowers himself to the floor and begins a practiced routine of situps as he punches a number on the phone.
51) 3) dialog: Edgar Price.
51) 5) dialog: Edgar Price.
51) 7) dialog: Can you get us a meeting?
51) 9) dialog: You and me. Edgar Price's new company. Game?
53) 1) dialog: Gotta go.
53) 3) dialog: Call me. Hanging up, Nelson continues to exercise... (CONTINUED)
53) 6) dialog: Why? She reaches him, grabs the cell phone, swats him like a nanny.
53) 8) dialog: Right. (points to TV) What's wrong with your TV? It doesn't work --
53) 12) dialog: Right. (pauses ) Where are my clothes? Sara walks away, toward the kitchen.
53) 14) dialog: You what --
53) 17) dialog: (holds up clothes) This is not 'helpful,' Sara. Give me my shirt and pants back.
53) 19) dialog: Yeah, well, it's just that this body likes to be covered in its own clothes. Sara grabs Ernie.
53) 21) dialog: My parents are dead. Sara sets Ernie on the floor. (CONTINUED)
53) 27) dialog: Sara, I am not amused. I want my clothes back. Now.
53) 32) dialog: I must be November.
53) 35) dialog: Is this some communal, culty, Squeaky and Charlie type of deal? (CONTINUED)
53) 39) dialog: I think I'll pull myself out of monthly rotation while I'm ahead.
54) 0) text: Nelson exits the loft, and Sara follows.
54) 2) dialog: You didn't tell me it was a cottage industry. And who the hell was that, your pimp?
54) 4) dialog: It doesn't seem like he needs looking after.
55) 5) dialog: I don't care. I don't read. Diagonally across the street, a vegetable market. The vendor, a Chinese woman, wags her finger and shouts at pictures of her family propped up on her Buddhist altar. Sara gives her a wave and continues with Nelson a few steps, where they encounter ABNER (10). He wears a red balaclava, practices balancing on one leg. Seeing Sara, Abner stops balancing and avidly follows her as if she were the Pied Piper. Nearby, a HOMELESS MAN rummages through the garbage, incongruously dressed in the chicest gear imaginable.
55) 8) dialog: Jesus -- those are my Prada pants!-- my sweater -- Petrified, Bruce takes off running.
55) 10) dialog: No! Nelson calls after the Homeless Man.
55) 11) dialog: Hey, hey. Give me back my pants.
55) 13) dialog: Where am I? (CONTINUED)
55) 20) dialog: No. Abner does a head-to-toe on Nelson, doesn't like the
55) 22) dialog: Nice hat -- planning a bank robbery? Bored with Nelson, Abner peels off in the other direction.
55) 24) dialog: Forget him, what's the deal with you? You sleep with half the city, get the whole neighborhood involved?
55) 26) dialog: Considering the alternative, yes.
55) 30) dialog: Look, Sara, you're great. You're a very sexy, smart, interesting, somewhat unusual woman... She just looks at him so guilelessly, he fumbles.
55) 32) dialog: But we ah... don't know where this is... I always think it's best to clarify issues... the beginning of... I'm not ready for... I can't be your man-man... She starts to laugh so hard tears roll down her cheeks.
55) 34) dialog: The truth is, I don't have a month. Time is money...
55) 36) dialog: (stung) You know, the more I think about it, this 'project' of yours feels like an excuse to get laid. That hurts. She flushes, looks away. He feels bad, didn't expect her to react this way.
55) 37) dialog: I'm sorry, I didn't think you'd... (gentler) I just don't understand why you're doing this, is all.
55) 41) dialog: Still friends? And like a brilliant emotional acrobat, she flips her mood back to lighthearted, done with consummate grace.
55) 43) dialog: What?
55) 45) dialog: All I can do is a day.
57) 0) text: Nelson stands stiffly behind Sara, who gestures expansively toward a rail-thin Nancy Kissinger-style SOCIETY MATRON.
58) 0) text: Extremely put out, Nelson walks beside Sara -- each holds three dogs on leashes as they head up a path. The dogs don't pull or tug, prance with military precision.
58) 1) dialog: Always a thrill to explore new career possibilities. How much do you charge for this?
58) 5) dialog: Get away from me! Another dog barrels up to Nelson. Desperate for a pet, the dog leaps up, licks and slobbers all over Nelson's hand. Disgusted, Nelson yanks his hand away. Sara shouts from f away.
58) 7) dialog: I do not give affection to a hairy, dirty thing. (CONTINUED)
58) 10) dialog: Get him off me! I'm going to kill him!
59) 0) text: The van is parked near a hose. Nelson sits glumly in driver's seat. Outside, Sara hoses off all the filthy dogs.
60) 0) text: Nelson checks his watch again. Peers at Sara in the side mirror.
60) 2) dialog: in van: stares, moved in spite of himself. Feels like a jerk for being so uptight. She comes to the window, breathless.
61) 0) text: Trying to be a good sport, Nelson awkwardly helps Sara to dry the dogs with hair driers. Winston starts to make a move toward Nelson. (CONTINUED )
61) 4) dialog: Winston. Stay away. You're not my type. Sara smiles to herself, thrilled to see he's managed to bend, just this little bit.
62) 0) text: Sara is licking an ice cream cone, counting money as she waits for Nelson to make up his mind about his order. Her van is parked nearby.
62) 2) dialog: I'll go for the lemon sorbet. She almost chokes -- the look on her face is not unlike the one he just made -- pure pity and horror.
62) 4) dialog: I think... when my parents dragged me to Alcatraz for the day, at the age of nine. He gets his sorbet and they start walking up the street together.
62) 5) dialog: Now you tell me something.

62) 10) dialog: (as she peers at him, confused) Why is letting some dogs go wild a better way to live than my way? Granted, it was mildly amusing, but I gotta tell you, my third eye didn't open.
62) 12) dialog: No, seriously, it's a question of values. Why is doing something fundamentally trivial better than living a responsible life, boring as that might seem to you? She is silent, he presses on. His tone is gentle, slightly teasing, but there's real truth to what he says.
62) 13) dialog: And who made you the expert, the doctor, the guru? Why do you have all the answers? Still, she is silent. He teases her.

64) 35) dialog: No. I thought those guys were everything he wasn't. Successful, proud, in control... He stops himself -- feels too exposed, shocked that such a sincerely-felt statement actually came from his lips. She feels his discomfort, reaches over and takes his hand. (CONTINUED)

Carefully wrapping the scarf twice around his neck, Nelson walks out of the park and into the street, just as a red Muni train slowly makes its way across the awakening city, its empty windows aglow in the dawn. FADE OUT.
