4) 1) dialog: ...and he had Ginger, the woman he  loved, on his arm.  But in the end...
5) 1) dialog: ...we fucked it all up. It should'a  been so sweet, too.  But it turned  out to be the last time that street  guys like us were ever given anything  that fuckin' valuable again.
7) 2) dialog: Got a lot of holes in the desert,  and a lot of problems are buried in  those holes. Except you gotta do it  right. I mean, you gotta have the  hole already dug before you show up  with a package in the trunk.   Otherwise you're talkin' about a  half-hour or forty-five minutes of  diggin'. And who knows who's gonna  be comin' along in that time? Before  you know it, you gotta dig a few  more holes. You could be there all  fuckin' night.
11) 5) dialog: They had so much fuckin' money in  there, you could build a house out  of stacks of $100 bills. And the  best part was that upstairs, the  board of directors didn't know what  the fuck was going on. At one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes a rapidly count the cash at a counting table. The camera fo a cash 'drop box' being lifted from the stack by a clerk. pours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to video camera. COUNTER #2 rapidly counts the cash and  announces:
11) 7) dialog: I mean, to them everything looked on  the up and up. Right? Wrong. The first counter recounts the cash.
11) 9) dialog: The guys inside the counting room... Stacks of bills lie nearby. The camera pans across the ro to another table manned by a COUNT ROOM EXECUTIVE who rep the figure and writes it down on a master list.
11) 11) dialog: ...were all slipped in there to skim  the joint dry.  They'd do short  counts, they'd lose fill slips. They'd  even take cash right out of the drop  boxes. And it was up to this guy  right here [NANCE], standin' in front  of about two million dollars, to  skim the cash off the top without  anybody gettin' wise ...the IRS or  anybody.
11) 13) dialog: Now, notice how in the count room  nobody ever seems to see anything.  Somehow, somebody's always lookin'  the other way. Now, look at these  guys [COUNTERS]. They look busy,  right?  They're countin' money. Who  wants to bother them? I mean, God  forbid they should make a mistake  and forget to steal. Meanwhile, you're  in and you're out. NANCE exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby the casino, passing ACE and SHERBERT, to a side exit door
11) 14) dialog: Past the jag-off guard who gets an  extra c-note a week just to watch  the door.  I mean, it's routine.  Business as usual: in, out, hello,  goodbye. And that's all there is to  it. Just another fat fuck walkin'  out of the casino with a suitcase.  Now, that suitcase was goin' straight  to one place: right to Kansas City  ...which was as close to Las Vegas  as the Midwest bosses could go without  gettin' themselves arrested. NANCE leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the curb.
12) 2) dialog: That suitcase was all the bosses  ever wanted ...and they wanted it  every month.
13) 1) dialog: Now this old Mormon fuck here...
14) 1) dialog: ...he had to fly in with suitcases  once a month, nice and easy.
14) 4) dialog: The bosses would come from all over  the place: Detroit, Cleveland,  Milwaukee. All over the Midwest.   And they would meet in the back of  this produce market in Kansas City.  I mean, nobody even knew. NANCE shakes hands with AMERICO CAPELLI, sixty-eight, a b affable Milwaukee entrepreneur and ARTHUR CAPP, his thirt year-old yuppie lawyer son. Camera continues to pan around the room.
14) 5) dialog: One of the guys made his mother do  all the cooking. On VINCENT BORELLI, seventy-year-old Kansas City boss.
14) 9) dialog: Now, these old greaseballs might not  look it, but believe me, these are  the guys who secretly controlled Las  Vegas. PISCANO joins his MOTHER and DAUGHTER by a stove.
14) 11) dialog: Because they controlled the Teamsters'  Union, and that's where you had to  go if you wanted to borrow money to  buy a casino.
14) 14) dialog: And nobody got a Teamsters' loan,  unless the guys in this room knew  they were gonna get their little  suitcases. FORLANO gets up from the table and walks toward NANCE.
14) 15) dialog: Guys like this antique here [FORLANO],  out of Detroit. Or especially guys  like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top  boss. NANCE embraces REMO GAGGI who's seated on a couch, and si across from him.
14) 17) dialog: Definitely the most important guy in  this room.
15) 13) dialog: Now here was the perfect front man.  I mean, what the fuck else could he  be?  He didn't know too much. He  didn't want to know too much,  especially that the bosses made the  Teamsters lend him the money. He  wanted to believe the Teamsters gave  him all that fuckin' money 'cause he  was smart. An exploding flash bulb fills the screen.
16) 1) dialog: And where they got Green from - who  the fuck knows?  All I know is that  Green was an Arizona real estate  hustler, who barely had enough gas  money to come and pick up his own  fuckin' check...
17) 2) dialog: Now, all they needed was somebody  they could trust to run the casino.  And who better than Ace?  I mean, he  was already in Vegas a couple of  years and he had the fuckin' place  clocked. FREEZE FRAME ON ACE.
18) 1) dialog: But typical Ace...
19) 1) dialog: ...give him a shot at runnin' a casino  and he tries to talk you out of it.
20) 1) dialog: And that's how that got Ace to take  over. ACES's hands place the die into a micrometer.
20) 2) dialog: 
20) 4) dialog: They worked out a real cute job title  too. We see the die in the micrometer.
20) 5) dialog: Tangiers Public Relations Director. Satisfied the die is not loaded ACE sets it on the craps  table, the camera cranes up to reveal the Tangiers Casino floor.
20) 6) dialog: But the only thing he ever directed  was the casino. He made his first  bet when he was fifteen years old,  and he always made money. But he  didn't bet like you or me. A DEALER is sliding chips, tossing them on to a craps tab
20) 7) dialog: You know, havin' some fun with it,  shit like that.
20) 9) dialog: He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
20) 13) dialog: He had to know everything, this guy. Direct overhead tracking shot as ACE walks between two ro of gaming tables.
20) 14) dialog: He'd find out the kind of inside  stuff nobody else knew, and that's  what he'd put his money on.
21) 1) dialog: Even back home, years ago, when we  were first hangin' out together...
21) 3) dialog: ...he'd know if the quarterback was  on coke. ACE is looking at the odds board for college football gam The bookie, LUCKY LARRY, is waiting for ACE to hand in hi picks.
21) 5) dialog: If his girlfriend was knocked up.
21) 7) dialog: He'd get the wind velocity so he  could judge the field goals. He even  figured out the different bounce you  got off the different kinds of wood  they used on college basketball  courts, you know?
22) 1) dialog: He'd be workin' on this shit day and  night. There was nothin' about a  game he was gonna bet that he didn't  know.
22) 5) dialog: Season after season, the prick was  the only guaranteed winner I ever  knew. But he was so serious about it  all that I don't think he ever enjoyed  himself.  But... ACE exits.
22) 6) dialog: ...that's just the way he was.
23) 0) text: The room has an espresso machine and a saint's day calend Assorted hoods are listening to NICKY at the bar. Camera  dollies to REMO GAGGI, at the rear table playing gin rumm with OLD MAN CAPO and losing. Every time the CAPO picks u card, he's able to knock or get gin, sending GAGGI into a fit bemoaning his bad luck.
23) 1) dialog: But back then the bosses didn't give  a fuck about whether he enjoyed  himself of not. To them, he was a  cash register. All they had to do  was ring the bell and take the money.  Especially Remo, who was a fuckin'  degenerate gambler who always lost.
23) 3) dialog: I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
23) 7) dialog: Ace made more money for them on a  weekend than I could do heisting  joints for a month. ACE enters and walks to GAGGI's table.
23) 8) dialog: Whatever Ace picked up on the street  he told Remo.
23) 9) dialog: (Walks over to ACE  and whispers) Hey, did you bring that thing?
23) 10) dialog: You know, I mean fixed fights, doped  horses, crooked fuckin' zebras...  locked-in point spreads. He told  fuckin' Remo everything. And to tell  you the truth. I don't blame him. GAGGI stands up and shakes ACE's hand.
23) 12) dialog: Keepin' Remo happy with money was  the greatest insurance policy in the  world. GAGGI beams as ACE takes out an envelope filled with cash and hands it over to him. GAGGI sits back down and ACE,  knowing his place, smiles and is about to leave.
23) 23) dialog: (To ACE) I'll be right out.
23) 25) dialog: Mm.
23) 27) dialog: Mm.
23) 29) dialog: All right.
23) 31) dialog: Yeah.
23) 33) dialog: (Reaching down to  touch GAGGI's money,  joking with him.) Want me to take this for you? (He walks out.)

24) 15) dialog: If he don't know, nobody knows. Told  you it was eight.
24) 17) dialog: 'Cause you're a jag-off. I would  have fuckin' made you lay ten... ACE notices a pen lying on the bar. He taps JOE on the  shoulder.

24) 31) dialog: Listen...
25) 1) dialog: ...with me protecting Ace, he made a  fortune for the bosses. I mean that's  what got him to Vegas. He was a money  machine. A tremendous earner for  these guys.  As soon as he took over,  he doubled the fuckin' drop. With  Ace the casino never saw so much  money. And the bosses, they couldn't  be happier.

54) 4) dialog: (Playfully) You mean, I have your permission?
54) 6) dialog: I don't care. I want to get away  from back home for a while. I'm tired  of that shit back there. (Referring to the  Vegas lights.) Look at this place. It's made of  money. You know what the best part  is? Nobody's gonna know what we're  doin'! There's nobody here to see  us! Everybody's back home.

65) 2) dialog: It was typical Ace. He invited the  biggest people in town and he knew  they'd show. Because he knew they  all wanted somethin' from him.  With  Ace, nobody ever got a free ride.  Even Ginger. With her - We see AMY in the cradle.
65) 3) dialog: - he still covered his bets. They  had to have the baby first, before  they got married. Even made Jennie  and me watch Amy for a few days when  they went on their honeymoon. But I  didn't mind, we loved the kid.

97) 1) dialog: Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He  does the most obvious thing. This is  the only town in the country where a  bookie joint is legit, so, why not  take advantage, right?  So... he  took bookie joints off the street  and then opened them up inside the  casino. Well, within a few years, by  doin' all of this, he had every casino  on the Strip trying to copy off him.

151) 8) dialog: Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
151) 10) dialog: You know... the first time I ever  saw your guys together... I never  saw him so happy. I mean, I know  he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything,  but... She smiles.
151) 11) dialog: I never see - You know, I never seen  him act like that with anybody else.   I think he's crazy about you. I mean,  he really loves you. He does.
151) 13) dialog: Sure.
151) 15) dialog: I can see that. Sure.
151) 17) dialog: You mean, like a lot of expensive  jewelry? About how much?
151) 19) dialog: No. I - I'm just curious, you know.  I was wonderin' how much he would  put into a thing like that. That's  all.
151) 21) dialog: Well, there you go. But what does  that tell ya? A million dollars in  jewelry. Does that tell you the guy  is crazy about you, or what?
151) 23) dialog: I know what you mean. He moves closer to her.
151) 24) dialog: Listen, Ginger... you know, this is  probably not... I don't have the  answers anyway... and this is probably  not what you want to hear right now,  because you're a little upset with  Ace.
151) 26) dialog: I understand that. But, you know, I  think you should try to make the  best of it now. Go slow, you know.  See what happens.
151) 29) dialog: Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves  you so much. He's jealous and worried.
151) 31) dialog: (Getting up) Look, I'll try to find out what the  hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll  talk to him.
151) 33) dialog: All right?

151) 38) dialog: You're a beautiful girl. You don't  want to ruin your looks. I've seen a  lot of girls get shot to hell from  this stuff.

160) 1) dialog: No matter what the problems were  outside the count room, it was all  worth it. The cash kept rollin' in.  And the...
161) 1) dialog: ...suitcases kept comin' and goin'.  And let me tell ya, the fuckin' bottom  line here is... cash. The trunk lid is shut.
162) 1) dialog: The only problem was that, after a  while, the bosses noticed that the  suitcases were gettin' a little light. FREEZE FRAME ON THE COUNTER POCKETING A $100 BILL.
164) 1) dialog: Even John Nance, that's the guy who  ran the skim, he knew there wasn't  much you could do about it. You gotta  know that a guy who helps you steal,  even if you take care of him real  well, I mean, he's gonna steal a  little bit extra for himself. Makes  sense, don't it? Right? Well, you go  try and make these hard-headed old  greaseballs understand that.
165) 4) dialog: But the bosses never believed in  leeway, so listen to what they do:  they...
166) 1) dialog: ...put Artie Piscano, the underboss  of KC, in charge of making sure nobody  skimmed the skim.
166) 6) dialog: The only trouble was, Piscano was a  disaster. This guy could fuck up a  cup of coffee.
166) 9) dialog: And little did anybody know where  this would all lead. If they did,  they would have been better off makin'  fuckin' novenas.
172) 3) dialog: She was doin' pretty good with her  lawsuit, but before she could start  countin' her money, the boys back  home decided to settle the case out  of court instead.

182) 19) dialog: Yeah. (Pause.) I think I want my money back.
182) 21) dialog: You know... I think that you've gotten  the wrong impression about me. I  think in all fairness, I should  explain to you what it is that I do.  For instance, tomorrow morning I'll  get up nice and early, take a walk  down over to the bank and walk in  and see you, and, uh... if you don't  have my money for me, I'll crack  your fuckin' head wide open in front  of everybody in the the bank. And  just about the time that I'm comin'  out of jail, hopefully, you'll be  comin' out of your coma. And guess  what?  I'll split your fuckin' head  open again. Because I'm fuckin'  stupid. I don't give a fuck about  jail.  That's my business. That's  what I do. And we know what you do,  don't we, Charlie? You fuck people  out of money and get away with it.
182) 23) dialog: (Grabbing CHARLIE by  his jacket) Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my  fuckin' money to sleep. You go get  my money, or I'll put your fuckin'  brain to sleep.
182) 25) dialog: Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is  personal. (Walking with CHARLIE  to the stairs.) I'll be there in the morning. You  can fuckin' try me, fatso. A frightened CHARLIE hurries down the stairs.
182) 26) dialog: You fuckin' try me. He turns to ACE who's behind the bar.
182) 27) dialog: You think he got the point?
182) 29) dialog: Fuck the FBI! That prick's been  dodging me for three weeks. And what  is it with you?  All of a sudden,  you're tryin' to tell me what to do  all the time.

If you're  actin' like this now, how can I depend  on you?  There's a lot of things  gonna change out here. And if you  wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're  gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
182) 33) dialog: Yeah, forget about your fuckin'  license. I plant my own flag out  here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin'  license. (Pause.) You know, I don't know what it is,  Sammy, but the more I talk to you,  the more I feel like you just don't  wanna go along with me, is that it?
182) 35) dialog: You should say so.
182) 37) dialog: Just say so.
182) 39) dialog: All right, fine.
182) 41) dialog: Fine. NICKY walks to a table and flips through Business Week  magazine.
182) 43) dialog: (Holding up the  magazine) You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the  boss.'  That's quiet?
182) 45) dialog: Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
182) 47) dialog: Well, back home they don't know about  fuckin' control. That looks bad.

182) 69) dialog: No, I didn't. What good would that  do? That's not the fuckin' point.
182) 71) dialog: (Interrupting) The point is that she's upset. She's -  and you got a fuckin' problem.

182) 75) dialog: ...to me.
182) 77) dialog: She came to talk to me...
182) 79) dialog: And I - what was I supposed to do,  throw her out?
182) 81) dialog: It's none of my business?
182) 83) dialog: A week ago it was my business, now  it's none of my business. In other  words, when you need me to take care  of somethin' for you, then you need  me.
182) 86) dialog: Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger  than your casino. That's your problem,  pal.
