3) 10) dialog: (with genuine charm) Wil-ma. Wil-ma? How about a great big good morning kiss for your Freddy-weddy? And he pulls the covers down to reveal -- DINO, who is immediately "YI-YI-YI-YI-ING," hopping all over the bed and showering Fred with sloppy kisses.
3) 11) dialog: Dino! Dino, cut it out -- !
3) 16) dialog: Dino, that's enough -- here, look Daddy has a nice dino bone for you, just please stop it -- Fred has now backed up to a dresser, where he grabs a brightly-colored box labeled "PURINROCK DINO TREATS." Fred holds it up -- Dino gets up on two legs, eager for the treat -- Fred shakes the box... alas, nothing comes out. DINO "YI-YI'S" again, propelling Fred into the next room.
4) 0) text: Five-year-old PEBBLES GIGGLES at the table as Fred and Dino tumble into the room like Frank Buck and a lion. Wilma turns at the noise. One look at her and we under- stand Fred's romantic turn.
4) 5) dialog: (throwing open the door) Oooh, Dino, look -- there's a nice big dino bone laying out on the front lawn -- ! Pause. Dino gives him a big look as if to say, "Oh, yeah?"
4) 6) dialog: (trying again) -- Gosh, look at that adorable little female dino -- "YI-YI-YI-YI," DINO is out the door like a rocket. Fred cackles, slams it shut, then sits down at the table.
4) 7) dialog: -- That animal's gonna kill me with kindness. Do you know we're out of dino treats?
4) 10) dialog: (sitting down) And what's wrong with my leftovers?
4) 17) dialog: That's right, sweetheart. The only thing that's gonna eat you up is -- me! And he grabs her and bites her and tickles her.
4) 19) dialog: Pebbles, don't worry. These stories are very exaggerated. Like, you know, the boogyman? There's no such thing as a huge, inhuman reptile that attacks without warning -- WHAM! Dino reappears, bounding through the window and knocking Fred onto the floor. Once again Dino is happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously unresponsive owner. Fred struggles to avoid the slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill, looks out.
4) 20) dialog: -- Oh, look, everybody, the mailman is here -- "YI-YI-YI-YI!" DINO buys it again, runs to the door lets himself out. This time Fred puts a chair against the door. Meanwhile, Wilma turns at the sound of the TOASTER POPPING UP. We see that the "claws" we saw earlier were the actual claws of a LOBSTER in a little fireproof suit who is tucked inside the toaster. As Wilma takes the toast, the Lobster blows on his claws, wincing, then looks TOWARDS the CAMERA.
4) 24) dialog: (taking the toast) Thanks, Wilma... Fred slaps jelly on the toast, takes a big bite, and then something outside the window catches his eye.
4) 27) dialog: Arnold! Arnold! Don't aim at the house -- please, not at the house -- WHAM! Fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams into the window frame, SMASHING a FLOWERPOT, taking out a chunk of wall, and continuing diagonally through the kitchen and out another window. Fred follows this action in time to see --
4) 31) dialog: (slight smile) Yeah. What else can go wrong? He slices through the big egg with his knife -- releasing a baby PTERODACTYL which SQUAWKS and flaps, knocking Fred over as it takes off through the window.
5) 0) text: Fred -- now dressed for work -- is forlornly trying to fix his car. (CONTINUED )
5) 5) dialog: "Bye, little sweetheart. (as Wilma clears her throat) "Bye, big sweetheart. Fred kisses them both and they drive off. Fred sighs, tries to stretch the canvas roof edges close enough to stitch. Nearby, Dino struggles to drag the stone news- paper inside the house. The twin headlines are, of course, KIBBLE CRISIS GROWS and MYSTERIOUS XENOSAURUS STRIKES AGAIN. Suddenly a pink flamingo appears over the hedge. As its mouth opens and closes, it appears to be talking, but the voice is that of --
5) 7) dialog: What's nice about it?
5) 9) dialog: This is the third ragtop this year say, shouldn't you be at work?
5) 11) dialog: You got fired, didn't ya? (CONTINUED)
5) 15) dialog: Yeah, I know, I know, those crazy inventions of yours. Be honest with me, Barn... tell me one thing you invented that really caught on.
5) 17) dialog: (pause) You invented fire?
5) 19) dialog: Yeah, but did any one of them ever put bread on the table? How long are you and Betty gonna live on those penny-ante royalties you get? Fred pulls his car hood off of its wooden hinges, examines it with dismay.
5) 20) dialog: If you ask me, pal, you're just blowing smoke up your own volcano...
6) 0) text: We can still see Fred's car in the neighboring driveway. (We can also see Dino, who drags the newspaper on a bit more, then collapses from exhaustion). Barney's garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and ends, plus various inventions and scale models in different stages of completion. (Interestingly, a number of these anticipate Leonardo da Vinci's work). Many of the models are made of a strange celadon green material. Fred watches, skeptical, as Barney presses the car hood into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone.
6) 3) dialog: (impressed) Two coo-coo berries? You made of money, Barney?
6) 5) text: Fred is caked with dust. He coughs and spits.
6) 6) dialog: Barney, why don't you try inventing a brain for yourself! Look at what you did to -- (CONTINUED)
7) 0) text: Fred and Barney drive along. (Behind them, the same houses and palms seem to be going by... duplex, palm... split level, two palms... duplex, palm). Barney grins, gestures towards the front of the car.
7) 2) dialog: Okay, you fixed a dented hood. But you call that a living? Face it, pal, this is the Stone Age, and it's a dino eat dino world. You want my advice?
7) 6) dialog: You stick with me today, cruise on down to the quarry and fill out a job application. I'm a big man there, Barney --
7) 8) dialog: I'm serious, pal. Me and Mr. Slate are just like this -- He takes his hand off the wheel to hold up two fingers... ends up swerving instead.
7) 9) dialog: -- just like that. I know, I know -- you're not a clock-punching guy -- but face it, Barney -- it's time to grow up and put your nose to the grindstone, batten down the hatches and join the ratasaurus race with the rest of us. (meaningfully) It's time to retire those dreams. Barney looks glum, doesn't say anything. Suddenly Fred pulls over, stops the car.
7) 10) dialog: Barney. Look.
7) 13) dialog: Remember the old days, Barn? We used to race our go-carts here to impress the girls.
7) 18) dialog: Hey. Since when do I have to be consistent? The two pals laugh, and then with a whoop they begin pedalling like mad. They go over the top, gravity takes over and they are flying past that billboard with all the Rotary Club welcomes on it. But now we see a different sort of welcome, as a POLICE CAR ZOOMS out from behind it
7) 20) dialog: 
7) 24) dialog: Sergeant Feldspar, I... I wasn't speeding... honest... Fred reaches down to the floorboard as he speaks...
7) 32) dialog: Well, Sergeant, if you don't have a radar reading, I guess we'll -- (quickly) -- justbeonourway -- ! A new cloud of dust appears as Fred ROARS away.
11) 0) text: Clouds of dust rise from behind the fence. We see the heads of the heavy equipment dinos rising and falling. A two-story office building is at one end of the site with a big "Slate Construction Inc." sign on the roof. CAMERA ADJUSTS as Fred's car turns into the lot, Barney seated beside Fred. The new green hood gleams in the morning light.
11) 1) text: Fred digs his feet into the ground, slams to a halt. He gets out, surveys the activity. Immediately, the various workers shout AD LIB greetings. Fred acknowledges these, beaming in the respect he gets here. He lovingly dusts off his construction helmet, puts it on knocks an offending speck from his parking sign (F. Flintstone - Shop Steward). He leads Barney towards the quarry area.
11) 2) dialog: Barney, you won't regret this -- hiya, Al -- fixing dents in cars is one thing, a career's another. Here, you're getting in on the ground floor of the first footstep of a new leaf -- hi, Wally, how's the old backhand? And with a guy like me ta show you the ropes, you can skip all the red tape, all the malarky, all the dino doo -- 22.
11) 3) text: Fred stands near the weight station booth, where a plump GIRL in a beehive hairdo sits inside a trailer.
11) 5) dialog: Hiya, Shirley. This is my very special neighbor and pal Barney Rubble. He needs an application form, okay?
11) 8) dialog: My pleasure, Shirl. Anytime.
11) 10) dialog: (confidently) No problem. Fred smiles at her, hands the forms to Barney. Fres steps towards the quarry, admires the activity, hands on hips, master of all he surveys. He waves to more friends.
11) 11) dialog: Well, Barn, what did I tell you? When you're in with Flintstone, you're in like Flint.
13) 0) text: Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving. Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them, we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the quarry's sides.
13) 4) text: Piltdown's compact buddy PYRITE cackles, sweeps up the walnuts. Munching them, he balances a new one in place. (It should be noted here that the relationship and physi- cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors that of our heroes... they're sort of an anti-Fred and Barney.)
13) 8) dialog: Not again... Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to the level of Piltdown's cab. Barney hurries to follow.
13) 9) dialog: All right, Piltdown, that's enough! You're endangering your fellow workers!
13) 11) dialog: Says me, Fred Flintstone -- shop steward of Amalgamated Neolithic Workers 101.
13) 15) text: Workers scatter, fearful of the imminent collapse. Fred runs to grab the dino's reins.
13) 16) dialog: Whoa, whoa, big fella -- He calms the beast by giving it a carrot. As it munches, Fred quickly ties the reins to a post.
13) 17) dialog: (calling up to the cab) You're on report, Piltdown! If it's up to me you'll be pushing a wheelbarrow!
13) 19) dialog: Fat butt? Hold me back, Barney -- (sotto, very sincere) -- Barney, hold me back -- Quickly the men form a circle around Piltdown and Fred. Barney looks up and sees --
13) 27) dialog: Yeah. That's right. (realizing, a glare at Barney) I mean -- this ain't over, Piltdown. (turning, shouting) Come on, guys. Let's clean up the mess. With much grumbling, ropes and grappling hooks are gathered and the crew hops to it...
14) 9) dialog: Barney! Grab that line! Hurry! Barney scrambles up Fred's back, shoving a foot in Fred's face, but finally snatching the rope. He pulls on it... Fred throws his own weight into the effort...
16) 3) dialog: Oh boy. Goodbye pension fund -- They rush for the office building.
17) 7) dialog: Barney, shut up -- (turning) Mr. Slate -- Mr. Slate -- are you all right? Slate staggers to his feet, seething with fury. He finally yanks the car hood free. It bounces and VIBRATES in his hands like a hand saw.
17) 20) dialog: Huh? What?
17) 23) dialog: Oh, it's ah, just something I whipped up in the old garage workshop -- (quickly) -- with a little help from my buddy Barney, right, Barn?
17) 32) dialog: Well, Mr. Slate, I call it -- (hesitating, sotto) -- Barney, what do I call it?
17) 34) dialog: -- I call it Fibrerock Fred -- ! (realizing) I mean, ah, 'Fibrerock'!
19) 0) text: They're cruising along. Fred puffs on a cigar. Barney flips the pile of legal sized tablets in his lap. In the back seat are some boxes and bundles.
19) 2) dialog: Just be thankful I was there to go over the fine print. (full of himself) It's like I told you this morning -- There's something noble about a man digging in with his hands and doing an honest day's work. Once you file those dreams under 'old business' and put your nose to the plow, well, the world is your oyster. And was I right?
19) 4) dialog: (after a moment) Details, Barney, details... (smiling) I just can't wait to see the girls' faces when we tell ‘em the news...
20) 19) dialog: Surprise! Pause.
20) 22) dialog: Why? Oh, me and Barn, we suddenly realized that we had a little spare change.
20) 27) dialog: Noogy, noogy, ha, ha -- ! (CONTINUED)
20) 31) dialog: Ready when you are. (noticing the label) Hey, '1'... a good year. This confuses the girls even more.
20) 37) dialog: We see your dollar signs, ladies... and... He tosses his stone contracts on top of the parchment ones with a THUD.
20) 38) dialog: . we raise them. Wilma and Betty look at each other, then at the contracts They blink, look again.
20) 42) dialog: You bet they're real, sweetheart. They're as real as... as... well, as real as -- (embracing the group) -- the best darn friends and neighbors in the whole world. Barney squeezes back.
20) 44) dialog: (emotionally) Right, pal o'mine. As they laugh and the girls slowly absorb the truth, we --
22) 16) text: Barney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant. He tacks it to the wall, yanks a string. It unrolls. It's a big "VOTE FOR FRED FLINTSTONE" poster. Barney turns, gives Fred a "thumbs up," and as he does, Barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his pocket. Barney pushes his way through the seats, catches up to Fred and hands him the document. Fred takes it, continues up to the podium. There, the Herdmaster hands Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each other like a Pharaoh's badges of office. Fred does a Papal-like wave with these, sets them down, and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him.
22) 17) dialog: (reading, at first wooden, then confident ) Brother Buffaloes, honored Herdmaster, Junior Bucks and Apprentice Antlers, a great good evening to you all. Ahem. As you know, our organization has survived difficult times that have seen the extinction of such other lodges as the Order of Whooping Cranes and Brotherhood of Giant Sloths. But we here have come through the croo the crux...
22) 21) dialog: (grateful) -- crucible with our fur fluffy and our hooves unscathed. Now, the future holds many promises and many problems. As your next Herdmaster, I would bring to you the same determination, courage and -- if I may say so -- bold thinking that I have brought to the workplace. Thank you, and ack ack a-dack. Applause follows Fred's return to the floor.
23) 4) dialog: Hey, when you're hot you're hot... boys, lemme buy a round of drinks for everyone.
23) 8) dialog: But the principle is the same, Barn. Don't forget that. Fred leads the group over to the bar. Piltdown and Pyrite come along with a shrug... why not, for a brew? Fred reaches --
23) 11) dialog: (during this) Here you go, boys, nice and frosty...
23) 15) dialog: (raising drink) Well, here's to... He looks around, sees --
23) 18) dialog: Here's to the greatest bunch of lifelong Buffaloes a guy could dream of leading. (an obvious prompt) Anybody else got a toast...?
23) 20) dialog: Aw, gee, Barn... you shouldn't say that... (winking) . at least not till after next week's election!
23) 22) dialog: Well, Harry, it just so happens that old Fred is moving up in the world... Boys, you're looking at Mr. Slate's new partner.
23) 24) dialog: Prepare to eat those words, Piltdown.
23) 26) dialog: (a tight smile) Gentlemen, my card -- He passes them out, and the others take them, curious -- 92 93 94 45.
23) 34) dialog: Barney, it's all part of the plan. (to the others) Yes, boys, you see, I went up to my pal, Mister Slate and single- handedly made him an offer he couldn't refuse -- (Barney reacts to the "single-handedly" --)
23) 35) dialog: -- 'Freddy boy,' he sez to me, "We gotta talk turkey -- '
23) 37) dialog: That's right -- just like that --
23) 39) dialog: Ah, excuse us, boys... 95 46.
23) 40) text: Fred pulls Barney into a quiet corridor. They stand near a trophy case. There's some bowling trophies here with a variety of names on them. (There's also trophies for "pie-eating contests" and "beer drinking chug-offs"; these have only Fred's name on them. )
23) 42) dialog: (lowered voice) Barney, we could tell everyone how you invented this Fibrerock stuff, how Slate and Lava found out about it by accident and all, but what would that be?
23) 44) dialog: This is big business, Barney. We can't start telling the truth, it'd create the wrong impression. Think about all the really big deals in history -- back to the beginning of recorded time. Barney knits his brow in thought for maybe three seconds.
23) 46) dialog: What do they all have in common? (as Barney is stumped) I'll tell you. A front man. A guy who's out in the public eye running the point, fighting the crowds... and meanwhile... back in the corner is the silent partner.
23) 48) dialog: That's because the silent partner is always silent. (MORE ) (CONTINUED)
23) 51) dialog: But while you're busy being silent -- (conspiratorially) -- all along you're the brains behind the operation and I'm the brains in front of the operation. I'm out here running the guts of the operation but you got a cut. It looks like my mind, but you're really behind.
23) 53) dialog: Attaboy! And a confident Fred shakes hands with an unsure "silent partner"...
24) 0) text: Barney comes out of his front door, heads toward the neighboring driveway and Fred's car. Betty comes out, calls to her husband.
24) 9) dialog: is at the car door, lunch pail in hand, when Wilma calls out to him.
24) 11) dialog: ("weighing it") Yeah... it does feel a little light... He returns to her, opens the pail, is surprised to find it's empty. Before he can comment, she smilingly presents him with a spanking new briefcase. '"F.F" is embossed on it in gold.
24) 13) dialog: Aw, Wilma... lookit, it's got buckles, a strap, a lock -- He opens it. Inside is a huge drumstick and some ribs.
24) 14) dialog: -- Baby, you're the greatest.
24) 16) dialog: I'm already taken. He moves to the car.
24) 17) dialog: Ah, Mister Rubble, I presume? Of the Fibrerock Rubbles? (CONTINUED)
24) 21) dialog: Yas, yas. The water was too deep and my horse drowned. They crack up at their own wit, drive off.
25) 0) text: Fred and Barney appear in Fred's car, make a very quick turn into the quarry lot.
25) 5) dialog: (getting out) Gets the old adrenaline going, Barn. Us big executives, we need that kind of jolt to get the old wheels turning. Lava comes INTO VIEW, carrying an armload of plans.
25) 9) dialog: Hey. What's going on?
25) 11) dialog: Yes, yes. Quick, dynamic entry into the marketplace. I approve.
25) 15) dialog: Hey, you're right... (resigned) Big business is hell, Barney. Trust me... you'll get used to it.
25) 21) dialog: Welcome to the top -- partner. And as they shake, we --
25) 33) text: Fred and Barney, weary, approach each other, shake hands as they view the day's incredible output. Other weary, but proud workers gather around them: Mr. Slate is about to address them from his office balcony.
25) 46) dialog: I do? (realizing) I mean, I do, yeah! He squares his shoulders, marches off.
26) 7) dialog: (undeterred) Mr. Slate -- we gotta talk --
26) 9) dialog: About those guys outside, Mr. Slate. Some of ‘em, well, they been here for years. And you, well, you can't lay them off just like -- (snapping fingers) -- that! Slate looks at Lava, who shrugs. Slate looks back at Fred, stays surprisingly calm. He toys with the putter, balances it on his palm.
26) 12) dialog: (bravura slipping) Oh, you can, huh?
26) 19) dialog: (guffawing) Me! Ah, ha, that's rich, Mr. Slate, that's -- Suddenly Fred stops laughing.

30) 9) dialog: Guys, guys, come on now -- what's a quarry fulla layoffs got to do with a lodge fulla Buffaloes?
30) 13) dialog: Fellas, come on. We're all big boys here -- He gestures vaguely towards the outside world, then back to the little band of brothers here.
30) 14) dialog: Surely we can separate in our minds work, and play... Job, and Lodge... (CONTINUED)
30) 20) dialog: Wait, wait... Your Antlerness, please, one second -- ! Fred grabs Barney by the shoulder, spins him around, pushes him forward like a refrigerator on a dolly, stands him up center stage.
30) 21) dialog: Barney, you gotta tell the other guys what really happened. Tell "em the story behind Fibrerock. The true story. The room quiets. Barney clears his throat. Fred waits, hopeful.
30) 23) dialog: No, no, the rest --!
30) 35) dialog: Big deal, after you screwed everything up in the first place...! Barney reacts, really hurt. He moves away on the bench. Fred's so agitated he doesn't even realize it. 129 130 131 132 64.
30) 45) dialog: No kidding. They rejected the best candidate --
30) 47) dialog: (genuinely worried) Oh, no! That -- that's horrible! (pause) We could end up with half a percent of nothing!
30) 49) dialog: Oh, yeah, yeah, that, too... come on, Barn, we gotta stop ‘em!
31) 5) dialog: I don't believe this... how did things ever get this out of hand -- ?
31) 7) dialog: Well, I wouldn't go that far... Suddenly they're interrupted by the sound of a SIREN. Fred looks back and sees --
31) 10) dialog: Oh, no, not now... Feldspar signals Fred onto the shoulder. Fred smiles, nods...
31) 12) text: Fred's CAR SKIDS, spins out, whirling around like a record on a turntable. It jerks to a halt 180 degrees later, and then ROARS off in the opposite direction.
31) 23) text: Fred and Barney cough in the rising dust. Neither one of them sees what we see, which is that visible in the hole in the wall is the Slate Company's granite-doored safe... and right beside it is the Xenosaurus, which now jumps up, startled, dropping a crowbar and a big hand drill. Recovering its composure, the Xenosaurus grabs up the tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away, vanishing just as our heroes stir. (CONTINUED)
31) 26) dialog: (double-taking) Barn! Did you see that -- ? (peering through the dust) -- Huh, now it's gone... I coulda sworn...
32) 6) text: Fred is hanging on the other end.
32) 7) dialog: Brother Piltdown... can we talk about this, antler to antler? Piltdown roars, begins slamming the girder up and down.
32) 8) dialog: Guess not... Fred inches down the shuddering beam, jumps off. Freed of Fred's weight, the other end "BOINGS" down on Piltdown's head. He groans, recovers in time to chase after Fred.
32) 11) dialog: Is backpedaling away from Piltdown on the upper super- structure of the assembly line. Fred scrapes one foot in an arc in front of him.
32) 12) dialog: Dare you to cross that line. Piltdown crosses it.
32) 13) dialog: That line. (CONTINUED)
32) 18) dialog: is flung to the conveyor belt, stiffly caked in clay.
32) 22) dialog: Back down the line, he's seen this. His clay-caked Adam's apple gulps. Quickly, he turns and tries to "tip-toe" away -- then, with a CREAK and CRUNCH -- the clay and Fibre all over him solidifies! Desperate, he tries to move... can't! 157 158 159 160 161 71.
33) 8) dialog: I don't wanna talk about it. Besides, who cares about a bunch of jerks running around with furs on their heads? I'm more of a country club guy myself anyway... He goes out, hardly looking at Barney. Wilma and Betty look at each other, mystified... then Wilma follows Fred out, puzzled.
34) 0) text: Lava stands in the shadows beside his Porscherock. Piltdown and Pyrite are with him. In the b.g., Fred and Wilma drive away.
36) 0) text: Lava walks Fred from the door into the color-coordinated high-style room.
36) 1) dialog: (on the move) But Barney doesn't want to take a vacation -- he says he's gotta be here to check up on the Fibrefoam --
36) 6) dialog: (nervous) Of course not, Mister Lava. But --
36) 9) dialog: Why, yeah, sure, Jerry.
36) 18) dialog: Well, actually, I wouldn't say small part... I'd say...
36) 20) dialog: Kind of a medium-sized... well, almost medium-sized... well, really a semi-partial assistant counsulting type, of --
36) 22) dialog: Well, gee, that's tough one -- (pause) -- Uh, what are my important duties?
36) 27) dialog: R-rockin' Leach? Indeed, it is he, and he smiles, extends his hands.
36) 29) dialog: M-me? On -- on television?
36) 31) dialog: (still in a dazed thrill) Barney who?
37) 2) text: Rockin' Leach is surveying the place with an aide. Fred and Wilma are with them. Leach makes a "frame" with his hands, "pans" the area. (CONTINUED)
37) 6) dialog: W-what's wrong?
37) 8) dialog: (pointing) Maybe you could move those plants to block them out...?
37) 11) dialog: It's the Rubble yard, Wilma. It's just not the right image... He starts away, suddenly notices his own barbecue and trikes... quickly, without missing a stride, he tosses a tarp over them, slides a potted plant over for good measure.
37) 29) text: Good evening. Tonight we come to you live from the ah... charming pied a terre of the man of the ‘our, Fred Flintstone -- Leach pauses, hearing the sound of someone CHIPPING AWAY at a stone tablet... he looks up at --
37) 30) dialog: He has just carved "FREDERICK" into a stone cue card and points to it.
37) 33) dialog: Now he's carved something grander. Leach sighs, goes on.
37) 41) dialog: (very affected accent) Well, Rockin', you're right, I have affected destiny for all mankind, and it's a sobering thought. However, if I may add a personal note at this time, I myself cannot personally take all the credit for Fibrerock...
37) 45) dialog: No, I could never have done it without the inspiration and support of a very special person. I'm speaking, of course, of my close friend and associate, Mister Slate, founder and C.E.0O. of Slate Construction...
38) 8) dialog: Stands beaming, nodding to his guests.
38) 9) dialog: Hello, hello. Bon soir. Good to see ya... glad you could make it...
38) 11) dialog: Fred -- there's the bar, make yourself at home -- mi casa es votre casa, so, when in Rome and all that --
38) 13) dialog: (alarmed) You mean you can see their house -- ?
38) 15) dialog: Wilma, I'm shocked. I wouldn't do that. Okay, I admit it: I'm trying to make an impression here, I wanna look good, I wanna be a success... He takes her hand, looks into her eyes. For a moment, Wilma's face softens. (CONTINUED)

Oh, I heard a great one the other day a guy walks in a bar with a duckasaurus on his head and the bartender says -- this'll kill you, the bartender says -- Fred stops, running out of steam along with his moment of glory.

39) 2) dialog: Just you and me now, Dino. Yeah. That's okay. Man and man's best friend. He gives Dino one of the canapes. Dino tastes it, makes a face, spits it out. DINO runs off, going "PTOOIE" all the way. We see him run to the corner, jump in Betty's car and drive away.

40) 7) dialog: (rummaging in it) Boy. Talk about memories. Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney, who grins, pulls it on. Fred also starts to get into his old "uniform," but has to suck his gut in mightily. Finally, he can zip it up, stern to stem.
40) 8) dialog: Back then, we thought a pop quiz was a big problem. We didn't know how good we had it. No problems, no worries... Saying this, Fred attempts to put on the Godzilla-like head.

40) 12) dialog: (echo-y) What for? So him and all his fancy friends can look down their noses at us? Completely covered in the ferocious-looking suit, Fred steps over to Barney, stabs an angry claw in his direction.
40) 13) dialog: (echo-y) All they've been doing is using us, Barney. And meanwhile -- Now Fred reaches up to take the head off. It sticks for a moment. Finally he gets it to flip back on its hinge where it hangs behind his neck like a ski parka hood.

46) 27) dialog: Tries to catch up and collides with the already damaged house. It collapses totally, falling in on itself, obscuring Fred. Finally the last TIMBER DROPS. Pause. Fred staggers out of the rubble, realizes that the impact has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its hinges. He rubs dust out of his eyes, turns and looks at the Slate Needle. He's much closer to it now. Quickly, he runs toward it.

As Barney starts to whizz upwards, Fred garbs onto his ankles!
49) 4) text: Fred and Barney both leap on the mysterious xenosaurus -- all crash through a wall --

50) 3) dialog: Piltdown? Pyrite?

51) 19) dialog: Waiting impatiently until the pythonsaurus finally finishes drinking. It wipes its mouth daintily with a napkin, slaps a little fire helmet on its head, turns and runs back into the other room.

A second later, the entire remaining structure collapses!
52) 26) text: Figures on one of the islands stir: Fred. Barney. Bam-Bam... Pebbles! The platform shudders again. Barney aims the flit gun -- empty! The dads hold on to the kids. It's all they can do.
52) 36) text: Dino dives through the hoops of bamboo, duplicating his steps in "The Dino Dance." He reaches the other island! Without a beat, still keeping time, he puts the two kids on his shoulders, just like in the dance! Then he "presents" his tail to Fred -- Fred hands his tail to Barney -- and then --

He ducks behind a big fallen chunk of Fibrerock -- catches his breath as the bullets and shells bounce off its resilient surface.
52) 44) dialog: Momentarily safe, he tries desperately to remove that stupid head -- bangs it against the wall, tears at it with his claws -- -- meanwhile, the chunk of Fibrerock protecting him decomposes! He's back in the line of fire!

52) 68) dialog: Barn...? What's going on?
52) 70) dialog: Dino kibble...? Disbelieving, Fred moves over to the happily-munching animals. He has to get on his knees to wiggle in with the pack. He grabs some, stuffs it in his mouth... chews. His eyes widen...

Fred stops in the doorway to put a milk bottle on the doorstep, and then puts the cat down beside it. He shuts the door. Quick as a flash, the cat leaps through the side window. Pause. The door opens and the cat puts Fred out, then slams the door! Fred recovers from his shock, tries the door... it's locked!
