5) 6) dialog: Nice morning, huh, Fred?
5) 8) dialog: Heh, hey. That Arnold's got a real arm on him, don't he? Now we see that Barney is holding the flamingo's stiff legs which he scissors, making the bird's beak trim the hedge.
5) 10) dialog: Ah, well, that appliance store and me, we kinda had a little adjustment --
5) 14) dialog: Fred, don't start on me again. I donno, I'm just not a nine to five guy. I got dreams, Fred. Ideas --
5) 16) dialog: I invented fire.
5) 18) dialog: I told you that, Fred. But the coal conglomerate ripped me off. The case is still in court, but meanwhile I got lotsa other ideas --
5) 21) dialog: Maybe, Fred. But first... He uses the flamingo's jaws to snatch the car hood from Fred's surprised grasp.
5) 22) dialog: Let me try some of that smoke on your car.
6) 0) text: We can still see Fred's car in the neighboring driveway. (We can also see Dino, who drags the newspaper on a bit more, then collapses from exhaustion). Barney's garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and ends, plus various inventions and scale models in different stages of completion. (Interestingly, a number of these anticipate Leonardo da Vinci's work). Many of the models are made of a strange celadon green material. Fred watches, skeptical, as Barney presses the car hood into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone.
6) 1) dialog: (as he works) -- See, the first step, we make a mold of the old car hood, smooth out the dent in the clay -- He tosses the original car hood aside with a crash. Then, moving rapidly, he starts heaving a variety of ingredients into the reverse imprint of the car hood.
6) 2) dialog: -- Add some lava granules... some woca leaves... juice from two coo-coo berries...
6) 4) dialog: Anything for a pal, Fred -- a lump of coal... bamboo sawdust... eucalyptus sap... a touch of the La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila. Barney dips a finger in this mess, "tastes" it; satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out of his skin.
7) 0) text: Fred and Barney drive along. (Behind them, the same houses and palms seem to be going by... duplex, palm... split level, two palms... duplex, palm). Barney grins, gestures towards the front of the car.
7) 1) dialog: Not bad, eh? After it cures for an hour or so, it's solid as a rock.
7) 3) dialog: Did I ever? (CONTINUED)
7) 7) dialog: You're a big man anywhere, Fred --
7) 12) dialog: Hey. Lava Lane.
7) 14) dialog: (wistful) Yeah, those were the days... we usta dream about coming back here some day with a real car and goin' for the goldrock...! A look from one to another, and then down the hill... Fred gets a malicious grin on his face. (CONTINUED)
7) 17) dialog: Fred... I thought you said it was time to retire those old dreams.
7) 21) dialog: (spotting the cops) Oh-oh! Fred, slow down -- ! Suddenly both Fred and Barney see the RADAR BIRD flying alongside them. It checks its stopwatch, writes a note to itself. Fred is so preoccupied he doesn't notice as --
11) 0) text: Clouds of dust rise from behind the fence. We see the heads of the heavy equipment dinos rising and falling. A two-story office building is at one end of the site with a big "Slate Construction Inc." sign on the roof. CAMERA ADJUSTS as Fred's car turns into the lot, Barney seated beside Fred. The new green hood gleams in the morning light.
11) 1) text: Fred digs his feet into the ground, slams to a halt. He gets out, surveys the activity. Immediately, the various workers shout AD LIB greetings. Fred acknowledges these, beaming in the respect he gets here. He lovingly dusts off his construction helmet, puts it on knocks an offending speck from his parking sign (F. Flintstone - Shop Steward). He leads Barney towards the quarry area.
11) 12) dialog: Gee, Fred. I knew you were a big shot. I just didn't know how big. Fred beams at that, and then follows Barney's gaze to the read-out on the truck scale. Fred is standing on it and it's pushing 250. With a scowl, Fred grabs Barney's sleeve and they go into the quarry. As they move, the CAMERA PANS and CRANES UP TOWARDS the window of the Slate Construction Office.
13) 0) text: Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving. Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them, we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the quarry's sides.
13) 1) dialog: (to himself) Social Security number... dependents... ‘how learned of job' newspaper ad, carrier pigeon... (writing) Personal reference... Hearing a loud SMASH, Fred looks up and sees --
13) 4) text: Piltdown's compact buddy PYRITE cackles, sweeps up the walnuts. Munching them, he balances a new one in place. (It should be noted here that the relationship and physi- cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors that of our heroes... they're sort of an anti-Fred and Barney.)
13) 22) dialog: Hey, maybe you guys oughta fix that first.
13) 26) dialog: It looks dangerous. Besides, you can kick Fred's fat butt anytime.
17) 6) dialog: Hey, nice going, Fred. You even got the spare --
17) 13) dialog: That's a lie, Mr. Slate!
17) 17) dialog: (pointing to his forms) B. Rubble. White male personal reference --
17) 24) dialog: Well, actually, Fred, it was the other way ar-- Fred hisses between his teeth, repeats the "Slate and me are just like this" gesture he made earlier, points at Slate. (CONTINUED)
17) 27) dialog: (reluctant ) Sure, Fred, right, right. Slate nods, distracted, his eyes and hands running over the smooth lines of the car hood.
17) 33) dialog: (sotto) Fibrerock, Fred...
17) 41) dialog: Gee, thanks, Mr. Slate. Lava glowers. Slate pulls Fred and Barney close with genuine excitement.
19) 0) text: They're cruising along. Fred puffs on a cigar. Barney flips the pile of legal sized tablets in his lap. In the back seat are some boxes and bundles.
19) 1) dialog: Gee, Fred, I don't believe it. Eight hours ago I didn't have a job and now look -- I got 1/2 of one percent of the after-taxes after-expenses net breakage profits on Fibrerock!
19) 3) dialog: No, Fred, you weren't. I didn't nose any grindstones and you didn't shoulder a wheel. We just hung out together and everything that happened was a total accident.
20) 19) dialog: Surprise! Pause.
20) 24) dialog: (presenting flowers) Betty, these are for you. For sticking beside me during the tough times, and well... for making a little guy feel like he was ten feet tall.
20) 26) dialog: Hey. Fred does something stupid every day and I still love him. Fred laughs good naturedly, grabs Barney in a headlock.
20) 36) dialog: Plenty more where that came from.
20) 43) dialog: Yeah. And nothing's ever gonna change that... right, Fred?
22) 7) dialog: Indeed we do, Brother Herdmaster. Tonight we are to hear speeches from prospective candidates for Lodge offices, such as good old Fred and some other guys.
22) 15) dialog: (rising) My apologies, Brother Piltdown. Allow me to rephrase. Tonight we will hear speeches from a whole bunch of good old guys... (pause) plus the one and only Fred Flintstone! Cheers go up, which drown out Piltdown's renewed cry of the poisoned water hole. Fred moves towards the podium as the noise dies down.
22) 16) text: Barney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant. He tacks it to the wall, yanks a string. It unrolls. It's a big "VOTE FOR FRED FLINTSTONE" poster. Barney turns, gives Fred a "thumbs up," and as he does, Barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his pocket. Barney pushes his way through the seats, catches up to Fred and hands him the document. Fred takes it, continues up to the podium. There, the Herdmaster hands Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each other like a Pharaoh's badges of office. Fred does a Papal-like wave with these, sets them down, and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him.
22) 18) dialog: (hissing) -- crucible -- (CONTINUED)
23) 0) text: WIDEN as Barney propels a bowling ball (stone, of course) rumbling down the alley, sending pins flying. The Buffaloes cheer Barney's strike. We notice that most (if not all) of these Lodge members also work at the quarry.
23) 5) dialog: Thanks, Fred, but here at the lodge drinks are free. (CONTINUED)
23) 19) dialog: "Here's to the Water Buffalo and their next Herdmaster... Fred'!
23) 32) dialog: tugs Fred's sleeve, pulls him close.
23) 33) dialog: Gee, Fred, how come I didn't get any business cards?
23) 36) dialog: Fred, we gotta talk turkey --
23) 38) dialog: Fred -- ! Fred realizes Barney's got something on his mind.
23) 40) text: Fred pulls Barney into a quiet corridor. They stand near a trophy case. There's some bowling trophies here with a variety of names on them. (There's also trophies for "pie-eating contests" and "beer drinking chug-offs"; these have only Fred's name on them. )
23) 41) dialog: Fred... what's this single-handed stuff? I distinctly remember at least four hands and two of them were mine.
23) 43) dialog: The truth?
23) 45) dialog: Okay.
23) 47) dialog: I never knew that.
23) 52) dialog: I get it. I got the brains, but you just pretend to have them.
24) 0) text: Barney comes out of his front door, heads toward the neighboring driveway and Fred's car. Betty comes out, calls to her husband.
24) 4) dialog: Thanks, Betty. What would I do without you?
24) 8) dialog: Come on, Betty, it's only my first day. You have to have seniority to run off... She giggles, kisses him.
24) 20) dialog: Yes, yes. Looking good, Mister Flintstone. I see you've recovered from that polo accident.
25) 0) text: Fred and Barney appear in Fred's car, make a very quick turn into the quarry lot.
25) 4) dialog: (when he's gone) Gee, Fred, driving with you is better than an 'E' ticket at Magerock Mountain.
25) 7) dialog: Oh, hi, Mister Lava.
25) 12) dialog: But, Fred, it's right where the employee basketball court used ta be -- (CONTINUED)
25) 16) dialog: I guess so. You already did. Lava leads them to a wood-sided trailer.
25) 20) dialog: All-right!
25) 26) dialog: Ready... aim... fibre! Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough. "Fibrefoam" pours into the mold.
25) 33) text: Fred and Barney, weary, approach each other, shake hands as they view the day's incredible output. Other weary, but proud workers gather around them: Mr. Slate is about to address them from his office balcony.
25) 45) dialog: Fred. You gotta do something about this!
25) 47) dialog: (proudly) That's my Fred...
27) 5) dialog: (worried) Fred? Fred staggers over to his locker, opens it... gets in, and closes the door. We hear a MUFFLED SOB.
30) 8) dialog: They're mad at you, Fred... it's understandable, I mean, they all got laid off today -- Fred crosses to the other guys, puts on a big smile.
30) 10) dialog: Is that a riddle? Give me a second --
30) 22) dialog: Well, there's not much to tell. (trying to remember Fred's phraseology) True, I got a cut... but Fred's got a gut.
30) 24) dialog: Oh, yeah, I remember! I got the mind, but Fred's got the behind. Right, Fred? Barney turns, gives Fred a big wink. Fred groans.
30) 33) dialog: Fred's a broken man. Barney moves over, puts his arm around him.
30) 34) dialog: I voted for you, Fred.
30) 44) dialog: Fred! Fred! The Buffalo are heading for big trouble -- !
30) 46) dialog: No, no, not that! Piltdown's got the guys all worked up and they're heading down to the quarry! They're gonna wreck the assembly line!
30) 48) dialog: No, Fred, if they do that they'll be breakin' the law! Our brother Buffalo could go to jail!
31) 6) dialog: I know. Makes you wish things were back the way they were... before we was big executives.
31) 23) text: Fred and Barney cough in the rising dust. Neither one of them sees what we see, which is that visible in the hole in the wall is the Slate Company's granite-doored safe... and right beside it is the Xenosaurus, which now jumps up, startled, dropping a crowbar and a big hand drill. Recovering its composure, the Xenosaurus grabs up the tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away, vanishing just as our heroes stir. (CONTINUED)
31) 27) dialog: Come on Fred. Time to earn those big bucks. They rush into the plant.
32) 4) dialog: Stee-rike one! Heh-hey. Ready for a curve ball? Pyrite doesn't have a sense of humor; club in hand, he jumps up, starts chasing Barney through the rafters. 146 147 148 149 69.
32) 9) dialog: Square off in the rafters.
32) 10) dialog: Give me your best shot. Pyrite swings. Barney ducks and Pyrite SMASHES a WINDOW pane. Barney dodges again and the same thing happens. Getting cocky, Barney does it one more time... but this time the window is hinged in the center and the swivel action after the hit whaps Barney on the back and knocks him into Pyrite's next blow.
32) 28) dialog: Chuckles to himself... and then looks down, reacts. CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet another of the duplicate Freds. Worried, Barney looks around, sees that he's just above the Fibrefoam chute. Without another thought, he jumps into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride --
32) 32) dialog: (sitting up) Whattya know. Even got the spare again... Then he gasps as he looks over at Fred, whose head has just fallen off! Pause. Fred's real head slowly pokes up out of the clay and Fibre shoulders. Before he can extricate himself further, Feldspar and his men are dragging them out of the building.
34) 5) dialog: Excuse me, Mister Lava -- ? I think you oughta know... something could be wrong with the Fibrerock mix.
34) 10) dialog: It tastes different.
34) 12) dialog: Yup. See, ever since I started with Fibrerock -- I mean, since me and Fred started with it, I always take a little taste of the Fibre foam. And tonight's batch, well... I didn't get much of it, but it seems a little off. (smacking his lips) Can't fool the old taste buds, heh-heh. I think there might be an ingredient missing. So tomorrow, I'll run a couple of tests and stuff --
34) 14) dialog: Nine days, Mister Lava.
34) 17) dialog: But --
35) 15) dialog: Looking around carefully, Barney takes out a Thermos bottle, unscrews the top, and quickly dunks it into the Fibrerock foam. Then he tiptoes 0.S., right into the massive bulk of --
35) 20) dialog: (fake crotchety voice) Ah, yup, yup, young feller... jest show me the way to the personnel office... I'm lookin' fer a job as a custodian...
37) 16) dialog: Fred's in a high-powered executive job, Betty. There's a lot of pressure on him.
37) 18) dialog: Trust me, Betty. After the Fibrerock debut, he'll be the same old Fred. Both react to the sound of HAMMERING and SAWING. Curious, they go out the sliding bedroom door into the yard and see --
37) 37) dialog: You mean beside Fred?
37) 43) dialog: (sotto, to them) See? What'd I tell ya? 190 191 192 193 194 85.
39) 9) dialog: (moving closer) Hiya, Fred. (noticing his ruined tuxedo) Boy, the rental place is gonna be mad... (eyeing the mess) . You feeling better, pal? (CONTINUED)
39) 13) dialog: Creep?
39) 15) dialog: (helpful tone) Fool?
39) 17) dialog: Slimeball? Louse? Jackass? (snapping fingers) Stuck-up blimpasaurus?
39) 19) dialog: (stepping closer) Sure, Fred. (smiling) I've had lots of practice.
40) 0) text: Fred and Barney are surrounded by books and cartons and memorabilia. They have their arms around each other and are singing.
40) 4) dialog: Yeah. Too bad we never made the team.
40) 6) dialog: You know Betty. She never throws anything away. He hauls out an old footlocker, opens it. There they are.
40) 9) dialog: Speaking of problems and worries, shouldn't we get on over to Slate's party? Fred has finally "clinked" the monster head down into place. Now, when he talks, the monster's mouth moves in sync. (CONTINUED)
40) 15) dialog: Yeah? When did you notice that?
40) 17) dialog: Boy, there's no fooling you, Fred. Suddenly, with a GROWING CREAKING, CRACKING and TINKLING, a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall apart. Fred and Barney look at each other, startled, then rush over to the model. It's the interim version we saw earlier.
40) 22) dialog: I... I don't know... the Fibrerock it's... it's decomposing... but this shouldn't happen...
40) 24) text: Indeed, the older models from Barney's tinkering days are rock solid.
40) 26) dialog: It should be. There's enough coo-coo berry resin in there to petrify a brontosaurus -- Suddenly Barney gets it. He looks from the older models to the now decomposing little Fibresphere with growing awareness.
40) 27) dialog: (snapping his fingers) -- The coo-coo berries! Fred, that's it!
40) 29) dialog: Remember I said the Fibrefoam tasted funny? It was the coo-coo sap that was missing!
40) 31) dialog: Why? Because coo-coo berries are as valuable as goldrock! And we've had tons of ‘em delivered to the plant since we started... somebody musta got greedy --
40) 33) dialog: (alarmed) Fred, that sap acts as a fixative -- it's the glue that holds the whole formula together -- ! (CONTINUED )
40) 37) dialog: (finishing it) ... Is gonna happen for real in the real Slate City!
40) 40) dialog: Coo-coo berry sap, Fred! It's our only chance -- their only chance! Barney gives it a quick test squirt. Fred nods, and they rush out of the room. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the ruins of the model "Slate City"...
43) 0) text: Fred and Barney rush along, Fred at the wheel.
43) 2) dialog: We just tell Mister Slate that all 500 acres of his development are going to crumble into dust any minute. (holds up the flit gun) Then we zap the stairs and corridors with some of this coo-coo sap. I just hope we have enough to get everybody out -- whoops! He's said this last because as he held up the flit gun, the handle whacked the back of Fred's monster costume, and the head has flipped down with a solid "clink." (CONTINUED)
43) 6) dialog: Hang on, hang on -- Oops. He rotates the head completely around. Fred flails around. Barney grabs the wheel with one hand, tries to help Fred with the other.
45) 2) dialog: both still battling the wheel and the resistant costume head. (By now their gyrations have put Barney's face inside the jaws of the monster mask.) 101.
45) 16) dialog: What, and explain what you're doing in that costume? Start talking about coo-coo berries and Fibrerock? By then it'll be too late!
45) 19) text: Fred and Barney stagger out of the wreck. Barney, covered with debris, rummages around and sighs with relief when he finds the flit gun of coo-coo sap is still intact.
45) 20) dialog: (hearing a siren) We'd better split up; that way at least one of us can make it to the Slate Needle -- !
47) 0) text: The supporting pylons and cable anchors begin to slowly decompose. A FLIGHT of STAIRS CREAKS AND GROANS. Barney runs INTO the SHOT, sees the steps about to go, dives for them... too late! He ends up with a face full of Fibredust! Now, he whirls as Fred runs up, points --
49) 3) dialog: (recovering) Fred, stop it! It might know the way inside! Fred "gets up to speed" and chases the xeno. Barney follows.
49) 4) text: Fred and Barney both leap on the mysterious xenosaurus -- all crash through a wall --
50) 0) text: The panicked partygoers turn as a section of wall collapses. Dust and debris billow upwards. The battered monster mask breaks loose from Fred's costume, bounces on the floor. Slowly, everyone gets up: Fred... Barney and two halves of the xenosaurus: The bottom half is Piltdown; the top-half is Pyrite.
50) 3) dialog: Piltdown? Pyrite?
51) 9) dialog: (pause; false smile) Sure, pal. We just gotta wait for the fire department. Right, Fred?
51) 14) dialog: It must be the suit, Fred -- old Bedrock High built them things to last -- Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the guests from the fire hose. As everyone gets the same idea, Dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth. All brighten. Barney helps Fred with the head, twists it into place.
51) 15) dialog: (rapping on the head) -- Okay?
51) 23) dialog: Come on, everybody -- we'll go out the way we came! Barney squirts a pathway with his flit gun, solidifying a route in the crumbling Fibrerock. Then Barney and Fred stand back nobly, wave everyone on into the adjacent Fibresphere.
52) 14) dialog: (to Betty) Go on, honey... I got Bam-Bam!
52) 26) text: Figures on one of the islands stir: Fred. Barney. Bam-Bam... Pebbles! The platform shudders again. Barney aims the flit gun -- empty! The dads hold on to the kids. It's all they can do.
52) 36) text: Dino dives through the hoops of bamboo, duplicating his steps in "The Dino Dance." He reaches the other island! Without a beat, still keeping time, he puts the two kids on his shoulders, just like in the dance! Then he "presents" his tail to Fred -- Fred hands his tail to Barney -- and then --
52) 60) dialog: You think there's gonna be some? Slate looks around at --
52) 69) dialog: (sniffing it) Lava Lava leaves... Woca sap... all still there, but now the nutrients are all released... (realizing) Fred, this... this is Dino kibble!
