5) 3) dialog: (wiping their mouths) Come on, kids. Time for nursery school.
6) 11) dialog: (in mid-speech, driving) . Oh, it's not that I'm complaining, Wilma. I mean, Barney's sweet, but... well, he's just not cut out to punch a clock. And he's such a dreamer you think he ever once picked up a hammer and chisel and tried to balance a checkbook? They pull up in front of a pleasant-looking simple little nursery school. MRS. GRANITE, a pleasant-looking 65, sees them from the schoolyard, waves while Wilma and Betty un- load the kids.
6) 12) dialog: No, Barney just keeps looking for that coo-coo berry pie in the sky, and I don't want to pop his balloon by talking about the price of mastodon ribs. She wipes off Bam-Bam's mouth with a handkerchief. Wilma does the same with Pebbles and then they kiss the kids, who immediately run into the schoolyard.
6) 14) dialog: You're welcome, Mrs. Granite. But we wipe their mouths every day.
6) 21) dialog: We're still shopping around.
8) 0) text: Betty and Wilma have just pulled up. We notice that next to their legal spot, a big limousine is parked in a "no parking" zone. But our law-abiding Betty in the next space now drops a stone coin in a parking meter.
9) 1) dialog: Morris, what on earth is going on? You giving away Bronto filets?
9) 13) dialog: Oh, I'd like some ground mammoth patties and uh... some dodo drumsticks.
17) 49) dialog: Here we are, Mrs. Slate. Sorry you had to ride in the back.
18) 10) dialog: Likewise.
18) 14) dialog: (suddenly) That's right, you don't understand. My husband's business manager usually handles this sort of thing, but I don't mind. And to Wilma's astonishment, Betty takes one of the parchments.
18) 15) dialog: I know Bam-Bam -- (correcting herself) -- pardonez-moi, 'Bem-Bem' will love attending your school and performing in the talent show. Thank you oh so much. She gives Mrs. Slate an even and controlled look, and sends some of it over in Wilma's direction as well. Wilma makes her choice, smiles tightly.
20) 0) text: The girls' frowns are a great contrast to their husbands' smiles. Wilma's looking at the school enrollment forms. Betty paces, looks at the clock. (CONTINUED)
20) 5) dialog: Unless they were forced to go bowling again. Remember that time a burglar pointed a gun at them and said, 'go bowling right now'?
20) 7) dialog: Don't tell me. I still can't believe what I did today...
20) 9) dialog: I know, I know! I just couldn't stand that woman's attitude! But we had to find a new school anyway, and there we were... the next thing I knew, I was in over my head... but why did you jump in, too?
20) 11) dialog: And?
20) 13) dialog: What do we tell the boys?
20) 17) dialog: We put ourselves in debt so the kids can attend school with a family we can't stand?
20) 20) dialog: Flowers?
20) 25) dialog: Aw, Barney... I... I don't deserve these. I did something really stupid today.
20) 33) dialog: They can't believe this.
20) 34) dialog: Boys... did you see... the dollar signs there at the bottom?

24) 1) dialog: Barney, wait a minute...
24) 2) text: He stops, turns. Betty comes over and we see he's wear- ing a sports jacket and an abysmally-tied tie. Betty fixes the knot.
24) 3) dialog: There. That looks more like a captain of industry.
24) 5) dialog: Hmm. Probably run off to the tropics with one of those executive secretaries. (CONTINUED)
28) 0) text: Betty and Wilma stand, determined, while the kids gripe.
28) 3) dialog: Well, you're both going to change your plans. Your new school is going to have a talent show... and you're going to have some talent.
28) 10) dialog: We're waiting. Pebbles and Bam-Bam sigh, huddle. We hear snatches of discussion...
28) 20) dialog: (to Wilma, impressed) Well? Think they're ready for the talent show?
33) 0) text: Wooden bars delineate the holding cells. "Wanted" posters of stone are hanging on the walls. As we watch, the contrite buffalos are bailed out by friends and relations. Wilma and Betty are just now clunking down stone money on the night sergeant's desk.
33) 1) dialog: Barney, I don't understand... what came over you boys?
37) 12) dialog: Betty, hair and face done, but still in a slip, is putting a reluctant Bam-Bam into a cute little blazer. In the f.g., Barney finishes tying a black tie, then struggles into a dinner jacket. (CONTINUED)
37) 15) dialog: I don't know why you want to go to this thing... after the way Fred's been treating you lately --
37) 17) dialog: Yeah... and it's all around his belt. If it wasn't for poor Wilma I wouldn't give him the Geological Time --
38) 42) dialog: Wilma, wait. I'm going with you.
38) 44) dialog: If friends can't do something stupid, who can? Wilma smiles, touched.
38) 45) dialog: Besides... (lowering her voice) Maybe if we leave the boys alone...? Wilma nods, hopeful.
39) 0) text: The film crew caravan is already leaving as Wilma, Betty and the kids get into the Rubble car. The last TV crew- man extinguishes the big spotlight. The house is dark forlorn in the fading twilight. 199 200 201 202 203 204 90.
46) 9) dialog: A circus, huh? Well, if our kids belong in a circus with their act, then your little nephew belongs in a zoo with his --
50) 1) dialog: Fred? Barney?
50) 11) dialog: (dryly) These sure look like coo-coo berries to me --
51) 7) dialog: In the middle of going down with the ship, she turns Bam-Bam's face away from this display.
52) 15) dialog: Barney... tonight you're the biggest man in Bedrock. She kisses him, slides down.
52) 30) dialog: W-wilma... those hoops of bamboo... those wires... do you think -- ?
52) 34) dialog: You can keep the twist, the frug and hop I don't need to shimmy, I don't need to bop --
52) 37) text: -- Dino slides down the long wire, carrying everyone to safety! They all plow into the biggest rescue net as Wilma and Betty wind up!
52) 38) dialog: Yes, I don't need to shimmy, I don't need to bop "Cause I'm doin', doin', doin'
