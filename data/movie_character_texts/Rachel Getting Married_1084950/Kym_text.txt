An ancient sofa, riddled with cigarette burns, some futons, dragged down and thrown haphazardly in corners, Unicorn posters hideously and pornographically defaced, and squat jars of ancient house products (Oil of Olay, self tanner) filled with cigarette butts offer proof of years of inhabitation. LATER -- Kym lights up.

19) 24) dialog: Bullshit. It's a sari. You take a bolt of cloth and wrap it around you. Jesus Christ I've been home one day and I can't get a straight answer out of anybody.
19) 26) dialog: I'm talking about Dad offering me food every ten seconds...
19) 28) dialog: No. He has to know where I am and what I'm doing all the time because he has never resolved his own trust issues.
19) 31) dialog: Shut up.
19) 45) dialog: I'd love to but he won't let me. I feel him watching me all the time. And Carol and you guys too.

Everything! And I really mean that, Rachel. I've been a nightmare and you've been a saint. I'm so damned glad I'm here with you and Sidney and his family and ours, and I am so happy for you guys, I really am. So, I am hereby raising my seltzer in celebration of my laudatory sister and herewith making amends. Sidney, you are robbing our dysfunctional family of one of it's most vital ingredients, and it's only member still willing to lend me money. (She pauses for a second) Enjoy Hawaii. La Chaim.

23) 98) dialog: Thank you Carol, for your inevitable pearl of wisdom, but you people are my family. You people make me feel like shit a hundred times a day. You try living under Dad's constant monitoring for five minutes and see how you like it.
23) 100) dialog: "I'll drive you!" "Carol, she's back!" "Don't sleep here, sleep there." "Here. Eat this." Dad, you're obsessed.

23) 125) dialog: (waving her arms) Hello? By the way? I'm not in crisis. I haven't been in crisis for a year.
23) 129) dialog: Why is this so difficult for you people to understand? It's like you're not happy unless I'm in some kind of desperate situation. You have no idea what to do with me unless I'm desperate. God. Why am I the only one who's willing to say this stuff?

24) 1) dialog: That was such a set-up.
24) 3) dialog: Ha! She's such an operator. Now I'm the bad guy again. Or still.
24) 5) dialog: Thank you! Otherwise they'd have to pay attention to their own suspicious lives. Nobody actually wants me to actually change, you know. What would they obsess about? I'm like a blessing.
