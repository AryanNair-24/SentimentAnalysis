7) 24) dialog: So it's all worked out perfectly...
7) 26) text: The two men go to the head of the stairs to watch SUSAN  come up.
7) 27) dialog: She get's the house, he get's the  cars.  And the baby is still in  Switzerland with the Au pair.
7) 28) text: SUSAN BARRINGTON is in her late twenties.  Flamboyant,  effortlessly confident, she inhibits that special world - with its different rules - of the truly ambitious.  James fascination owes as much to the certainties of her class  as to her looks. An attractive young man accompanies her up the stairs. Jeremy makes a sound.  Susan Glances up.
7) 29) dialog: Jeremy!
7) 30) text: She waves and her elbow catches a tray of champagne being carried downstairs.  Glasses fall about her feet.  While  apologising, Susan does not take her eyes off Jeremy.

7) 35) dialog: You're so famous now.
7) 37) dialog: We're thinking of doing this current  affairs thing for schools.  World  history since 1945.  Twelve  programmes, lots of stock film.
7) 39) text: James and Susan say "Hi" and shake hands.
7) 40) dialog: Was that your chapter, then?  It  was very good.
7) 42) dialog: (not remembering) Yes, that's right.  I'm being  terribly rude.  Bob?  Oh, Bob.   This is Bob Tuckett.  Bon was at  Oxford too.
7) 43) text: Bob, Jeremy, James all say "Hi".  Momentarily enthusiasm  flags, no one speaks.  Then the drinks tray is suddenly i their midst and they all reach out thankfully, with mock  groans of relief and surprise. An hour later, Guests are leaving.  James has got Susan  alone.  They descend the stairs.  CLOSE ON Susan, a  disparate kind of seriousness.
7) 44) dialog: I mean, in many ways I'm right  behind the women's movement.  But  sometimes I wish they'd get on  with it instead of moaning on.   The office was split right down  the middle.  I mean, as a woman I  understood what they were saying,  that current affairs was all about  what men did, but as a human being  and a television researcher, as a  professional , I could just sense  they'd got it all wrong.  I could  see there were two paths I could  go down, power or not-power.  Down  the not-power path was lot of  sisterly feeling, masochism and  frustration.  Down the other path,  I could keep on working.  So of  course I voted with the men and  the other women all resigned.  I  think they're mad, don't you?
7) 47) dialog: No, it's all right.  I can get a  cab.  Night night.
19) 0) text: James and Susan arrive at the Barbican together.  Their  conversation is a little detached from its subject matter They are feeling each other out.  They are not disagreein here.  As they talk they make a complicated route through the Arts Centre, always on the verge of getting lost.

19) 4) dialog: I think it went on rather too long.
19) 6) dialog: And I didn't like that man.
19) 8) dialog: And the shape of it all.  It was  sort of...shapeless. 
20) 2) dialog: Good theory.  But I like my mother.   I have no aversions to what she  does.
20) 4) dialog: My real father?  Well, he was a  flashback.
21) 0) text: A little later.  A Private View.  A discreetly murmuring, wine, canapГ©s. The paintings - painfully pretentious - represent various forms of aesthetic self-consciousness. James and Susan look at the pictures, but make no referen to them.  They spend a little time in front of each one  before moving to the next.  James speech is broken by  moments of contemplation.  As they move on again, he pick up his thread.
21) 2) dialog: And you're at this third stage
21) 4) dialog: I think you're exaggerating.  And  if you aren't, you should jolly  well change your job.
21) 6) dialog: Yes.  You're much too old to making  a drama out of alienation, or  whatever you call it.  You've got  to take responsibility for your  own happiness.  That's what I think  anyway.
21) 7) text: Susan has moved on a couple of steps and is bending forwa to look at a picture.  James smiles at her wonderingly, a little deflated, but impressed.

Then  a couple of years after Daddy died,  and not long after I left Oxford,  she started seeing various men and  I was furious.  I really was upset.   I stopped going home.  I never  phoned.  I went round telling  everyone how awful her books were.   And she hardly seemed to notice,  and that made me angrier.  Then I  got a job I was interested in, and  I started to see lots of men, and  I suppose I grew up a little and  began to understand.  So I wrote  her a long letter, almost seven  pages, saying how sorry I was, and  how I was worried that we were  drifting apart.  And do you know,  she wrote me a poem, a really  beautiful poem about mothers and  daughters.
23) 3) dialog: It makes me weepy just to remember  it.  So we were fine again, and  then she got married to Matthew  who's a womaniser and a bit of a  yob, but quite nice really, makes  TV commercials.  What about yours.
23) 5) dialog: That must be rather nice, in a  way.  I mean, you don't have any--

34) 2) dialog: I have to be up early. (She stands)
34) 4) dialog: (straightening  herself at the  mirror. James  standing close) Two or three years ago I would  have stayed.  And fucked you.
34) 6) text: He stands behind her and kisses her neck.  She turns and  they kiss.  Susan pulls away.  She taps James's nose with her forefinger.
34) 7) dialog: Now I'm more wary.  I must be  getting old.
34) 10) dialog: I don't trust anyone.  That's what  comes of working in television.
34) 12) dialog: I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
34) 15) dialog: (smiling) You just might.

56) 17) text: Our two minute sequence is presented to represent an hour of film.  When at last it is over and the lights come up, there is a moment of stupefaction.  Susan yawns and prepa to leave.
56) 18) dialog: Do you think she's invited you up  for her sake or for mine?
56) 20) dialog: (smiling, mischievous) Well, you should.
56) 21) text: James kisses Susan.  She complies rather than responds. Susan disengages herself gently and gathers her things.   She stands.
