53) 0) text: James follows Betty through the woods.  A rumbling and  whining noise increases in violence and becomes deafening once they leave the wood and cross open ground towards a  Military Air Base.  The Peace Camp is near the perimeter  fence.  A ramshackle collection of tents, caravans, a tep and a rough wooden shelter which is the communal area.  A fire burns here.  Various peace signs, Women's Movement  sign and slogan.  ('Fight War, Not Wars', etc.) Three women are sitting around the fire.  A little furthe off a MAN is chopping wood.  One of the women, CARMEN, is over sixty.  The other two are in their thirties.  The  man, PETE, is a vintage hippy.  A good mix of regional  accents among the campers.  Betty leads James to the fire
