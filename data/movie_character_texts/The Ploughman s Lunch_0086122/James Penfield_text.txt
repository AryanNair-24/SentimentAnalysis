It passes through the  copytaster's hands and it passes on down to the summaries desk. This is a time of steady activity.  Journalists move abou the room to consult.  Others are writing in longhand, and several are dictating copy to typists, who are all women. One or two people - NEWSREADERS - sit about doing nothing Much movement of paper. Over the sound of typewriters and the murmur of dictating voices we HEAR a WOMAN'S VOICE over the P.A. Announce,  "The Leader of the Opposition on five".  A few journalist pick up their headsets, but they do not stop writing.  We establish the atmosphere - laconic but efficient, and a  little down-at-heel. At the summaries desk we find JAMES PENFIELD.  He stands  to the side of a little behind a seated secretary, dictat in a laconic deadpan voice from a sheet of scrawled  longhand.

3) 0) text: James and the newsreader sit at a table in the studio,  fairly close together.  The newsreader settles himself  behind the microphone.  James sits back, professionally  bored, rolling a stub of a pencil between his fingers. Through a large loudspeaker we hear a Radio 4 programme  winding up.  Theme music. The newsreader has a plummy authoritative voice and is a  year or two younger than James.  He stares down at the  news sheet. From the Control Room a woman announces "One Minute".
3) 1) dialog: How's Mary?
3) 3) text: From the Studio Controller's POV we SEE the Newsroom behi James and the newsreader, who chat soundlessly.

5) 0) text: James' flat is one floor of a large Victorian house.  The decent-sized rooms knocked together make a very large  bedsitting room.  Bare boards, junk furniture, but elegan Heavy stereo stack, a lot of records, a lot of paperbacks In high spirits, James prepares to go out.  He chooses a  shirt, begins to undress.  The TV is on.

By some large double doors i a display of school textbooks.  Most prominently featured is the book being launched today - Goldbooks Schools Seri No.  5 The Cold War, edited by Prefessor J. Gerty. James is led by a PERSONAL ASSISTANT through the crowd to meet GOLD, who is surrounded by ATTENTIVE YOUNG MEN.
7) 2) text: From the circle of polite laughter, Gold extends his hand towards James.
7) 9) dialog: Hello.
7) 11) text: Twenty minutes later.  JEREMY has just come in and is  surveying the room from the doorway.  He takes a drink  from a tray, notices James across the room and smiles  ruefully. Jeremy Hancock is a journalist, same age as James, good- looking and well-dressed.  A fairly corrupt look about  him, despite this.  He is intelligent and intensely self- regarding. James makes his way through the crowd towards Jeremy.   They stand on the doorway - a position which affords them a good view of the guests in the room and those guests wh are still arriving by way of a grand and ornate stairway.
7) 13) text: With mock solemnity, he kisses James on the cheek.

7) 20) dialog: Nonsense.
7) 23) dialog: Fuck off.
7) 25) dialog: That's her.
7) 28) text: SUSAN BARRINGTON is in her late twenties.  Flamboyant,  effortlessly confident, she inhibits that special world - with its different rules - of the truly ambitious.  James fascination owes as much to the certainties of her class  as to her looks. An attractive young man accompanies her up the stairs. Jeremy makes a sound.  Susan Glances up.
7) 32) text: The butler and the young man drop to the ground and set  about picking up the glasses.  Susan regards them for a  moment, then steps round them and hurries up the stairs. Jeremy and Susan go into a clinch, with kisses.  James  stands a few feet off.
7) 39) text: James and Susan say "Hi" and shake hands.
7) 41) dialog: Thank you.  We met last week, at  the Wajda film.  You won't remember.   We didn't actually speak.
7) 43) text: Bob, Jeremy, James all say "Hi".  Momentarily enthusiasm  flags, no one speaks.  Then the drinks tray is suddenly i their midst and they all reach out thankfully, with mock  groans of relief and surprise. An hour later, Guests are leaving.  James has got Susan  alone.  They descend the stairs.  CLOSE ON Susan, a  disparate kind of seriousness.
7) 45) text: They arrive by the front door.  There is the briefest pau James makes his bid.

9) 2) text: James come in.  The Editor ignores him pointedly.  There  are no more seats.  James stands somewhere inconspicuous.
9) 10) dialog: Could be.

10) 0) text: James is clearing a desk he has against a wall, in  preparation for work on his Suez book.  It is a desk that has not seen much use before, piled high with clutter.  H brings over a lamp for it, arranges the typewriter in its centre.  Various London library books are arranged along  one edge. On the wall above the desk, James pins a large map of Eur and the Mediterranean.  He sits at the desk, lines up a  couple of pencils...and picks up a book.
11) 0) text: Langan's, Piccadilly.  Gold and James are met at the door by the HEAD WAITER, Gold is obviously known here.   Businessmen, media people, agents, conspiracy, urgency,  babble.  Cornucopia too - dessert trolley, cheese trolley something being flambee'yd at a table. ANOTHER SHOT through the diners we find Gold and James  already seated.  The main course has been cleared away. clock shows the time to be ten to three.
11) 1) dialog: I was only ten years old at the  time, but it was the first  international crises I can remember.   It's obviously a key point, and  I've always thought that sooner or  later we would have to re-examine  Suez in the light of subsequent  events.  And now, suddenly, with  this Falklands business on us,  it's quite clear we do need to  take another look at 1956.  The  way I see the book is that it would  get away completely--
11) 4) dialog: No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
11) 6) dialog: ...break away completely from--
11) 8) dialog: ...from all the moralising and  talk of national humiliation that  is now the standard line on Suez...
11) 11) dialog: No.  I'd want to--
11) 13) dialog: I'd want to set out events as they  happened.  The way I see it is  this: the British Empire was an  ideal.  It may have become totally  obsolete by the middle of this  century, but it wasn't totally  dishonourable to try and defend  its remains and try and salvage  some self-respect, which is what I  think the Conservatives were trying  to do.  Then there's the essential--
11) 15) dialog: Yes, please.
11) 17) dialog: Thank you.
11) 18) text: Gold speaks to the waiter as James continues.
11) 19) dialog: ...there's the business of the  British collusion with Israel.  Of  course it's proved beyond all doubt  now, but I want to set it in the  context of diplomacy and warfare.   I mean, if you're about to attack  one country, it makes sense to  encourage neighbouring countries  to attack it to.  The French  understood this.  They could never--
11) 20) text: The waiter brings the coffee.  Gold is lighting a cigar,  having offered one to James.
11) 21) dialog: The French could never make out  all the embarrassment and breast- beating of the British.  My enemy's  enemy is my friend.  It's as simple  as that.  If we had not been so  scrupulous we would not have been  so ashamed.
11) 22) text: The waiter brings the sambuccas.  We CLOSE IN on the drin as James goes on talking.  Gold puts a match to James's  drink on this next line.
11) 23) dialog: Now it's as if we discovered  ourselves again.  We're acting  independently when the standard  line has always been that after  Suez we couldn't lift a finger  without the Americans.
12) 0) text: Gold and James stroll through the arcade, bloated from  their lunch.  Both are slightly drunk.  Gold is expansive
12) 2) dialog: Freshman and sophomores...
12) 4) dialog: Like I was saying, the American  angle in Suez is very important.   I wouldn't want to say they let us  down.  I think that's wrong.  A  good ally is one who doesn't back  you up in your mistakes, who tells  you when to pull back.  And the  Americans were good allies.  Simple  as that.
12) 5) text: James is immensely pleased with his own performance durin this speech.  Gold, however, is more interested in someth he has seen in a shop window.  As soon as James finishes, Gold mumbles an apology and plunges into the shop.  James follows him in.
13) 0) text: A lull in the action.  Most of the journalists are eating out.  A few eat sandwiches, smoke, chat, read.  A backgro television shows crowd scenes from Argentina. James sits with a plastic cup of coffee reading intently. He stands at the window looking out over the roofs.  Then he turns abruptly, picks up a telephone and dials.

16) 3) dialog: I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It  was just impossible to get away.
16) 5) text: James picks up the tray - tinned tomato soup, buttered  bread, and a cup of tea.
17) 0) text: MRS. PENFIELD lies on her back, dozing.  She is plainly  very ill.  James sits at the bedside.  The tray of food  cools on a bedside table.  We have a sense of time passin Mrs. Penfield opens her eyes.  James kisses her on her  cheeks.
17) 2) text: This speech appears to exhaust her.  Hey eyes close.  She keeps hold of James's hand.  She murmurs.

18) 6) dialog: Yes, you said.
18) 8) dialog: No, thanks Dad.
18) 10) text: James shakes his head.  There is a long awkward silence, hopeless silence that is particular to both father and  son.  Finally James gets to his feet.
18) 11) dialog: I've got to be going.  I've got a  meeting tonight.
18) 13) dialog: I'll ring you in the next couple  of days.
19) 0) text: James and Susan arrive at the Barbican together.  Their  conversation is a little detached from its subject matter They are feeling each other out.  They are not disagreein here.  As they talk they make a complicated route through the Arts Centre, always on the verge of getting lost.
19) 1) dialog: What did you think of that Wadja  film?
19) 3) dialog: I thought it was tremendous.
19) 5) dialog: I couldn't bear for it to end.
19) 7) dialog: Oh, but he was terrific.
19) 9) dialog: Really?  I thought those long  flashbacks were extremely good.
20) 1) dialog: You don't like flashbacks because  your mother's a historian.
20) 3) dialog: Too bad.  What did your father do?
21) 0) text: A little later.  A Private View.  A discreetly murmuring, wine, canapГ©s. The paintings - painfully pretentious - represent various forms of aesthetic self-consciousness. James and Susan look at the pictures, but make no referen to them.  They spend a little time in front of each one  before moving to the next.  James speech is broken by  moments of contemplation.  As they move on again, he pick up his thread.
21) 1) dialog: Everyone describes the same process.   At first it is exciting.  You're  at the centre of the world.  As  soon as anything happens, you're  the first to know about it.  And  there are deadlines a dozen times  a day, even more, and that's  intimidating and exciting.  Then  you get the hang of it and the  excitement wears off.  Your a clerk  in a rather dowdy Office.  There's  none of the glamour of television,  or the penetration of serious  journalism.  You're a processor of  semi-official news.  Some people  leave at this stage.  Then, if you  hang on, and especially if you're  promoted, you discover a new kind  of pleasure.  You're pleased by  the ease with which you can write  summaries and bulletins from news  agency printouts, by the way you  ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast  on the dot, having everything run  smoothly, selecting a running order  that makes sense, knowing  instinctively what you can and  cannot do.  Professionalism.
21) 3) dialog: No, there's a fourth.  Numbness.   You do everything right, but you  feel nothing either way.
21) 5) dialog: Oh yes?
21) 7) text: Susan has moved on a couple of steps and is bending forwa to look at a picture.  James smiles at her wonderingly, a little deflated, but impressed.

22) 2) text: Edward approaches.  He is a contemporary of the other two but looks much younger and less worldly in manner.  He is slightly nervous.  He works on a literary magazine and he is a poet whose work is just beginning to be recognised. The three are old friends.  Jeremy and James keep up thei friendship with Edward because they recognise his talent, and this makes them feel more authentic.  Edward keeps up with them because he is lonely and his own life is rather dull.  However, he does distrust them a little.  And they keep his talent in place by teasing him. As Edward enters the other two applaud.
22) 6) text: James pours wine into Edward's glass.
22) 7) dialog: We were admiring your poem in the  TLS, Edward.
22) 11) text: James picks up the TLS and waves it at Edward.

31) 10) text: During this, Jeremy has caught James's eye and they have  started to giggle silently.  This continues through the  scene.  They hunch up and turn away from each other, shak quietly, half recover, become aware of each other, or of  the absurdity of the questions, or of Edward's attempts t deal with them, and they fold up once more.  From Edward' POV we SEE their heads duck down.
31) 12) text: While Edward answers, the woman nods vigorously. James and Jeremy recover in the brief pause between  questions.  They lift tear-stained faces, then crack up a the next question. A young man, anorak, flat auto-didact's 'does the team  think' voice.  A piece of paper in hand, he stands,  trembling.
31) 17) text: CLOSE ON James, drawing breath.  A sudden sharp yelp from Jeremy fighting for air.  All heads turn.  The two are  almost off their seats onto the floor.  We move CLOSE ON  them and hear their moans or 'No', 'No' and 'Stop', 'stop and 'Sorry!'  
32) 2) text: James is standing by a secretary dictating.
32) 3) dialog: Wait...and with talks at the United  Nations still making little  progress, tension and anxiety  settled on MPs of all parties in  Westminster.

They inhale smoke as if it were fresh air.

Anne appraises James and deals with the coffee, and for  the first time in the film we take a long, hard look at  him too.  The light flatters.  The notebook at his side,  his patience and deference, the well-cut suit...he is at  least credible.
44) 2) dialog: What a shame.
44) 4) dialog: (smiling, uncertain) Well, I am a great admirer of your  work.  I read your books on Chartism  when I was still at school.  I'm a  journalist, not a historian.  There  are questions of method, and  approach.  I wondered--

47) 0) text: Anne and James are returning from an after-lunch walk.  W have a glimpse of the landscape we will see more of on  James's return. As they walk they arrive through a back gate into the  Barrington garden.  A jet fighter races through the sky.
47) 4) dialog: Actually, we've only just met.   But we're quiet good friends.
47) 6) dialog: Yes.
47) 8) dialog: Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.

48) 3) text: Matthew's car comes sweeping up the drive.  Tom is in the front seat.  Matthew stops his car so that his front door is by James. MATTHEW is fifty.  A director of commercials for cinema  and television.  Breezy, chunky-faced, keen to be taken  seriously.  Essentially good-humoured.
48) 6) text: Matthew and James shake hands over the car doors.
48) 11) text: James pulls away.  Ann stands watching him till he is out of sight, and a little longer after that.

50) 0) text: Half an hour later.  A lonely road in central Norfolk.   James brings the car to a sudden halt.  He switches off  the engine.  In the silence we are able to hear the car  cassette player.  As it plays, James walks round the car  till he finds his flat tyre.  He rummages with growing il temper in the boot.  Two cases of empty wine bottles, a  mildewed towel and swimming trunks, but no jack.
50) 2) text: Furious, he goes to the front of the car and snaps off th tape machine, and stands jiggling his keys in the vast  silence. A minute later.  James sets off.  The immensity of the  landscape, the incongruousness of his clothes...

52) 0) text: The road passes through a wood.  When BETTY speaks, it  surprises both James and us. She stands at the head of a little grass track that leads into a wood.  She carries a plastic carrier bag.  She is  almost childlike in her friendliness.
52) 2) dialog: What?
52) 5) dialog: James Penfield.
53) 0) text: James follows Betty through the woods.  A rumbling and  whining noise increases in violence and becomes deafening once they leave the wood and cross open ground towards a  Military Air Base.  The Peace Camp is near the perimeter  fence.  A ramshackle collection of tents, caravans, a tep and a rough wooden shelter which is the communal area.  A fire burns here.  Various peace signs, Women's Movement  sign and slogan.  ('Fight War, Not Wars', etc.) Three women are sitting around the fire.  A little furthe off a MAN is chopping wood.  One of the women, CARMEN, is over sixty.  The other two are in their thirties.  The  man, PETE, is a vintage hippy.  A good mix of regional  accents among the campers.  Betty leads James to the fire

53) 16) dialog: It's fine, thanks.
53) 18) dialog: Penfield.  James Penfield.
53) 20) text: The women smile and murmur hello as they are introduced. Their friendliness progressively disorientates James.
53) 26) dialog: I work in radio news, in London.

53) 42) dialog: I'll suggest it.  Remember though,  we're news, not features.  It might  help if you could get yourselves  attacked by the police.  Anyway,  I'll be back with this soon.   Thanks.
53) 44) dialog: I won't be a moment.
54) 0) text: James drives down the road towards the airbase.  He stops his car well short of the camp.  He takes the jack from  the car and walks towards the camp.  There are more peopl now moving in and out of the light of the fire.  The soun of voices, laughter, mostly female.  A meal is being cook James sets down the jack where it can be found.  He has  been observed throughout by Pete, from the shadows.  He  speaks as James is turning back towards his car.
54) 2) dialog: Er, yes, I put the jack by the ...  hut there.  Thanks for your help  ... I... I have to be getting back  ... so ... see you.  And thanks  ... and ... all the best.

56) 7) dialog: Perhaps I will, then.

56) 12) dialog: I think she liked me.
56) 14) dialog: No.  We talked about history, and  Siberian Geese.

We SEE a series of FILM CLIPS about Suez: crowd scenes in Cairo; footage of the Fleet on its way from Malta; the  actual invasion; parachutes; Eden at Downing Street; Lloy at the airport; the protest meeting at Trafalgar Square;  fighting in Suez streets. James sneaks occasional looks at Susan throughout.  We SE her in profile, lit by the screen.
56) 19) dialog: (kissing Susan's  fingers) I haven't really thought about it.
56) 21) text: James kisses Susan.  She complies rather than responds. Susan disengages herself gently and gathers her things.   She stands.

58) 3) dialog: No.  That's terrible, Charles.   What happened?
59) 6) dialog: Well, it's all a bit cranky and  small scale.  Vegetarians, hippies,  disturbed housewives.  Local radio  story, I'd say, if that.  They're  mad.
60) 0) text: Two hours later.  The studio.  James and Charles sit at  the table, as in Scene Three.  Charles reads.  He is  obviously distressed but his voice remains under control. James watches anxiously.

Guide track: sweet, period music.  Dad sit in an armchair reading a newspaper.  A pipe is near at  hand.  To one side, a wireless.  At his feet, a girl play with a doll; a boy plays with a model steam engine. Mum enters with a tray of steaming hot drinks.  As she  sets down the tray on the arm of Dad's chair, the music  peaks and the children half rise and arrange themselves o either side of Dad's legs.  Everyone smiles up at Mum.   Once this has unfolded, we pull back to see the camera  crew, continuity, make-up etc. James is standing to one  side watching.
