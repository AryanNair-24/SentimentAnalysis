1) 8) dialog: IвЂ™m Anna. Lucie doesnвЂ™t respond... like she didnвЂ™t even hear her. ANNA (contвЂ™d) YouвЂ™re Lucie, right? ThatвЂ™s what the Sisters said. Still nothing... just the scratching of that crayon on the paper. ANNA (contвЂ™d) Do you wanna play or something? Even Anna knows she isnвЂ™t going to get an answer. But she still crouches there beside Lucie for a moment... giving her a chance before finally standing... ANNA (contвЂ™d) Bye. ...Walks away... doesnвЂ™t see behind her...

SAINT MARY'S ORPHANAGE/ANNAвЂ™S ROOM - NIGHT Just the dim glow of a hall light creeping through the open door. Anna lies in bed, staring at the ceiling... whispering.
1) 9) dialog: I pray the Lord my soul to take. If I should... An 0.S. SCREAM interrupts AnnaвЂ™s prayer. A familiar scream. LucieвЂ™s scream. Anna looks to the hall... Two NUNS hurry past. Anna climbs out of bed... moves to the door, and peers out... watches them rush into a room.
1) 11) text: I sneak in the kitchen when Sister Rachel is doing her beads. Lucie doesnвЂ™t react. Anna starts to rest the cookie on the stump again, but this time Lucie reaches out... eases the cookie from AnnaвЂ™s hand. ANNA (contвЂ™d) TheyвЂ™re still warm. (beat ) You donвЂ™t have a family either, huh? Lucie just takes a bite of the cookie. Again, Anna waits for an answer she isnвЂ™t going to get. So she turns to leave... just as Lucie inches over on the stump... knocking her sketch pad to the ground. But now thereвЂ™s room for two. Anna smiles... drops down beside her... watches Lucie take another bite, then looks out into the distance... silently sharing LucieвЂ™s stare. And then we go to a... SERIES OF SHOTS...

6) 0) text: Music... beer... laughter. Except for Anna, standing at a window, looking out at the dark quad. She looks much like Lucie did that first day at the orphanage... searching for something while the rest of the world lives. MARCUS, (21), good-looking Frat Boy, moves up behind her... wraps his arm around her waist... holds a plastic cup to her lips, but Anna leans her head away from it.
6) 2) dialog: I just donвЂ™t feel so great tonight. Marcus leans in... kisses her neck.
6) 4) dialog: IвЂ™1l call you later. Anna pulls away... makes her way to the door. Gone. INT. DORM/ANNAвЂ™S ROOM - NIGHT Anna lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.

Anna stares at the photographs. A tear slips down her cheek. 16. INT. DORM/ANNAвЂ™S ROOM - MORNING Anna asleep. Just in front of her, a CELL PHONE rests on a nightstand beside the old photographs. The phone VIBRATES... stops... VIBRATES again... loud enough to stir Anna awake. Her eyes try to open... canвЂ™t. She reaches blind for the phone... answers.

29) 7) dialog: We donвЂ™t have time.
29) 9) text: (beat)UCIE(cont 'd) Then it will have to let me go. Anna hesitates... eyes LucieвЂ™s face... sheвЂ™s so sure. Anna nods... stands... starts out.
29) 10) dialog: IвЂ™m going to find you some clothes. Lucie rests in the tub... raises her hand up above her... studies it... itвЂ™s covered in scars zig- zagging all over her skin.
30) 0) text: Anna pulls a t-shirt from a dresser drawer... adds it to the pants she already has in her hands. She starts out of the room... stops in the doorway, and looks back... ...to that puddle of blood seeping out from under the bed... ...the hint of the GirlвЂ™s foot tucked beneath in the shadows. Anna stares at it a moment, then turns... ...RIGHT INTO LUCIE... her naked body dripping wet. Anna jumps with a start.
30) 1) dialog: Jesus.
30) 3) dialog: IвЂ™1l meet you in there. Lucie watches Anna walk away. 32.
31) 0) text: Anna enters... just stands there a moment before she spots the SHOTGUN on the floor.

41) 0) text: Anna walks into the room... glances around. Her eyes settle on a shelf of FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS... ...various shots of the family through the years... smiling and laughing together. 36. They look completely normal... the perfect family. Not a pack of sadistic torturers. Anna pulls down one of the pictures... sits on the couch, and just stares at it... those faces so full of life. Her eyes slowly rise from the photo... to a table... a PHONE resting there... waiting for Anna to just pick it up. Anna gazes at the phone... then glances to the hall... no sign of Lucie... back to that phone again. Finally, Anna stands... walks to the phone... another look to the hall before she picks it up... ...we can hear the V.O. DIAL TONE. Anna stares at the receiver a beat... until her trembling finger hits the вЂњ9вЂќ... BEEP... ...she throws a quick glance over her shoulder to the empty hall... ...back to the phone... вЂњ1вЂќ... BEEP... ...her finger hovers over the button... knows what that final push means.

Anna turns... scans the other direction... THUMP from behind her... she spins back around... ...Still no one. And then she sees the MOTHER MOVE... somehow... her body arch... her foot twist into the wall... THUMP. Jesus, sheвЂ™s alive. And Anna doesnвЂ™t know what to do... just stands frozen, staring... ...as the Mother GASPS... her eyes flutter open... she reaches a bloody hand out to Anna. 38.

41) 15) dialog: I will, but you have to be quiet. Anna begins to lift the Mother up... she CRIES OUT IN PAIN. ANNA (contвЂ™d) SHHHH... please. SheвЂ™1l hear us. Anna throws a nervous glance to LucieвЂ™s doorway... no sign of her yet. So Anna keeps lifting... ...until the Mother is standing on her rubbery legs... an arm wrapped around AnnaвЂ™s neck.
41) 17) dialog: Quiet.
41) 19) dialog: IвЂ™m taking you to them. You just have to stop talking. Anna and the Mother make their way down the hall... to the front door... ...as Anna looks behind them again... still no Lucie. 39.

42) 8) dialog: (whispers) SheвЂ™11 kill you if you donвЂ™t stay quiet. Anna holds her hand across the MotherвЂ™s lips, as she stares through the bushes to the door... ...Still no sign of Lucie. And itвЂ™s long enough that we start to think everythingвЂ™s going to be fine. But then a CLICK from behind them... a TWIG SNAPPING... 40. ...and as Anna turns to it... ...LUCIE LEAPS FROM THE SHADOWS... ...SWinging that knife... slamming it down into the MotherвЂ™s back. The Mother CRIES OUT. Anna falls away. ANNA (contвЂ™d)

42) 20) dialog: No, Lucie. But itвЂ™s true, and Anna knows it... so does Lucie. ThatвЂ™s why the tears fill her eyes. The knife slips from her fingers... to the ground at her feet.

61) 0) text: AnnaвЂ™s cleaning up where the Boy was killed... now working with a roll of paper towels... slopping the blood up. She tears off the last shred of towel... just that cardboard tube left. She tosses it away... starts her search for more... ...opening cabinets... drawers... nothing.
62) 0) text: Anna searches the room for towels... picks up some folded t-shirts... theyвЂ™1l work. She opens a large cabinet door... sees a mop leaning against the back wall of the cabinet. Anna grabs the mop, and the BACK WALL MOVES. Anna notices... sees a handle... pulls the wall open... because it isnвЂ™t a wall, itвЂ™s a door. Anna squints into the darkness beyond... reaches deeper... finds a light switch... CLICK... ...@ row of FLUORESCENT TUBES flicker on, leading down a narrow, cement stairway.

And thereвЂ™s nothing musty or filthy about this place... itвЂ™s clean... sterile. Like something you might find in a hospital. Anna stands there a moment... not sure she wants to see whatвЂ™s down here. But her legs arenвЂ™t listening to her brain... start walking on their own... carrying her slowly down the hallway... her footsteps echoing... ...reaching LARGE PHOTOGRAPHS along the walls... gruesome surgical photos... a YOUNG WOMAN WITH STITCHES SURROUNDING HER NECK, as if her head has been sewn onto her body. The Young WomanвЂ™s eyes are wide open... gazing upward... ...,another WOMAN lying on a operating table... her intestines pouring out of her open stomach... and her EYES OPEN WIDE... GAZING UPWARD... ...an OLD WOMAN hanging from a wall... hundreds of hooks through her skin... wires attached, suspending her in the air. And just like the others, her EYES ARE ROLLED UPWARD. Anna continues past the images... down the hall until she sees a LOCKED TRAP DOOR in the floor... she pulls on it... locked. She glances around... finds a RING OF KEYS... works her way through the various shapes until one fits... CLICK... the lock pops open. Anna removes it... pulls open the hatch... LIGHTS AUTOMATICALLY FLICKER ON BELOW. ThereвЂ™s a metal ladder leading down into the belly of the beast. Anna takes a breath, then climbs down the ladder.

She pulls at the handle... locked. She continues on to the next door... same thing. Anna presses her nose against the glass to peer in... too dark to see anything. She slides down to the next door... repeats the motion... everythingвЂ™s locked down here... ...S80 she glides past the last door, tugging at the handle without expecting it to open... ...BUT IT DOES. Anna freezes... stares at that door cracked open... her hand still gripping the handle... just not ready to pull it wide.

65) 1) dialog: Oh, God. Because AnnaвЂ™s world has just been turned upside down... ...Lucie was right about this place... about those people. Anna sees IRON RINGS BOLTED TO THE WALLS... one of them has a LONG, THICK CHAIN hanging from it... coiled along the floor, then stretched out disappearing into the shadowy back corners of the cell. Anna runs her hand along the ring... crouches down to lift the chain.
65) 3) dialog: ItвЂ™s okay. IвЂ™m going to help you. And AnnaвЂ™s voice must be so different than what the WomanвЂ™s used to... she springs toward her, hugging AnnaвЂ™s legs... pleading in those animal tones. Anna sees the chain is attached to a metal belt around the WomanвЂ™s waist. ANNA (contвЂ™d) I have to find a key. Anna starts away, but the Woman clings to her. ANNA (contвЂ™d) IвЂ™m not leaving you.

68) 1) dialog: Come with me. The Woman moves cautiously... unsure where AnnaвЂ™s leading her. She extends a spindly arm in front... feeling her way. 53. As they move out of the cell, AnnaвЂ™s foot drags across the chain... it CLANKS on the floor, and the Woman SCREAMS OUT... jerks away from Anna... throws her arms over her head to protect her from what always comes next. ANNA (contвЂ™d) ItвЂ™s okay. IвЂ™m not going to hurt you. Anna gently takes the WomanвЂ™s hand again... leads her out.
69) 0) text: Anna guides the Woman down the corridor.

ANNA (contвЂ™d) You need a doctor to do this. Do you understand me? A doctor. I canвЂ™t take it off. The Woman calms. Anna finds a ROBE... wraps it around the WomanвЂ™s withered frame. ANNA (contвЂ™d) Come on. 54. Anna leads her out of the room.
71) 0) text: Anna eases the Woman onto the couch.
71) 1) dialog: YouвЂ™re in a big open room. Nothing here will hurt you. The WomanвЂ™s head snaps back and forth. Her hands nervously scratch at her arms... hard enough that her jagged fingernails tear into her own flesh... ...just the way LucieвЂ™s arms used to look. Anna grabs the WomanвЂ™s hands... holds them still. ANNA (contвЂ™d) No. No more pain. ItвЂ™s over Do you understand me? All thatвЂ™s over. The Woman calms... as if maybe she understands. ANNA (contвЂ™d) I need you to stay here... just sit until I get back. I have to go upstairs... get Lucie... so we can leave. The WomanвЂ™s head jerks around... finally nods. ANNA (contвЂ™d) You understand me? IвЂ™11 be right back. Another nod. Anna walks out.

Then Anna follows LucieвЂ™s eyes... to the ATTIC DOOR STRING hanging from the ceiling. Those 0.S. FOOTSTEPS are coming up the stairs... fast. Anna and Lucie reach for the string.

ANGLE ON ANNA AND LUCIE... lying facedown in the darkness... squeezed behind an old chest of childrenвЂ™s toys. And their hands are clasped together... just like two frightened little girls. THE MANвЂ™S FEET ease along the atticвЂ™s center walkway... nearing the Girls. AnnaвЂ™s eyes squeeze shut, just hoping this will end. LucieвЂ™s are wide open... ready to face her monster again. But the Man walks past... doesnвЂ™t see them... reaches the far end of the attic... kicks a box over... empty... ...just as the ATTIC DOOR SLAMS SHUT BEHIND HIM.

The Girls take off again... full speed along the edge of the cornfield... ...and now we can see the road ahead of them... their cars waiting to lead them to their escape.

85) 0) text: Anna sits on the floor against the couch. Lucie is still unconscious beside her. 61. AnnaвЂ™s eyes scan over the Men flanking the room, silently watching her. And AnnaвЂ™s hands are on the floor behind her...

And then a SOFT CLANK OF A CHAIN... as if whoeverвЂ™s moving it on the other side doesnвЂ™t have much strength. So it isnвЂ™t much but itвЂ™s enough for Anna. 66. Anna closes her eyes... relieved. ANNA (contвЂ™d) WeвЂ™re going to get out. I promise we are. Suddenly AnnaвЂ™s cell door swings open, and TWO MEN are striding in... fast... too fast for Anna to react before they have pinned facedown on the ground. ANNA (contвЂ™d) No! Get off me! One of the Men grabs Anna by the back of the neck... yanks her head straight back... straps a METAL BIT into her mouth, gagging her. Then they wrestle her into the chair bolted in the center of the floor... tighten the cuffs around her wrists... her ankles. Anna strains to break free... no chance. So she just sits there, sucking in air over that bit... ...watching the Men move back out of the cell... stay gone for a quiet moment, then re-enter, carrying some kind of ELECTRICAL BOX. AnnaвЂ™s eyes are wide with fear, as she watches them connect ELECTRODES to her legs... arms... each side of that metal bit. Anna tries to talk... tries to ask them not to do whatever it is theyвЂ™re about to, but it just comes out as jumbled sounds... sounds these men have heard a hundred times before. One of the Men flips a switch on the machine... it HUMS TO LIFE. Now Anna knows whatвЂ™s about to happen... begins violently shaking her head... trying to shake free... ...asS the Man FLIPS ANOTHER SWITCH... CLICK... BUZZ... ...and a JOLT OF ELECTRICITY sends AnnaвЂ™s head snapping back... her body goes stiff... her jaws are clamped down on that electricity-filled bit... ...finally, the Man turns the machine off... the energy dies... 67. ...and AnnaвЂ™s body falls limp in the chair... GASPING and drooling over that bit.
88) 7) dialog: (barely audible over the bit) No more... please. The Man looks to the doorway, where Eleanor has been standing, unseen. He shakes his head. Eleanor turns... walks away.

She frantically pulls at the dirt and rocks... drags herself into the pipe... ...just lies there, crying. Then she starts crawling... dragging herself along the length of round pipe... pushing through the sludge... dead rodents. And right now, AnnaвЂ™s eyes are wide open... sheвЂ™s fighting to live.

But whatever they are, they stun Anna... like she just heard something she canвЂ™t comprehend... something extraordinary... not good... not bad... ...just unbelievably powerful. She rises back up, staring at Lucie as she lets the gun fall to her side... drop to the floor... ...giving Eleanor the chance to hurry to Lucie herself... to lean close... and just like with Anna, EleanorвЂ™s the only one that can hear LucieвЂ™s WHISPER. And Jesus... whatever it is that Lucie said has the same effect on Eleanor. She slowly straightens... backs away from Lucie.
