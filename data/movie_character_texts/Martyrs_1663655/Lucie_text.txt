And this world is silent as we drift along the center of the empty pavement... move tight on one of those puddle-filled mini-craters... close enough to see the skyвЂ™s cloudy reflection in the milky water ItвЂ™s all so peaceful... ...until a SMALL, BARE FOOT SPLASHES INTO THE PUDDLE. And then we see who the foot belongs to... ...a LITTLE GIRL, (LUCIE), (10), wearing just a stained, tattered gown... her bruised, terrified face lined with tear-streaks through the filth... her mouth open wide, like sheвЂ™s screaming but nothing will come out. And Christ, sheвЂ™s running fast... as fast as her little body will take her... those bare feet SMACKING THE PAVEMENT as she throws frantic glances over her shoulder... ...but the street behind her is empty... ...S0 she just keeps running toward us... like weвЂ™re the only people in the world that might be able to save her.
