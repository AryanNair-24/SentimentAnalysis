He's put flowers and candles and costume jewelry and religious icons (from all the Majors) on top of and around the broken cement.  Currently he's on his knees, rocking back and forth as he prays. And,lo! There came a rumbling even as from the very bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and delivered up the vision of a young man whose countenance caused the Soda Jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his face and to weep in fear.  And, Adam, taking pity on the man, put down his suitcase, and went to him, saying:

Then he is surprised to see a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE so casually dressed in public. She (overweight) is in an unfortunate terrycloth halter-shorts combination.  He (hirsute) is in a sleeveless undershirt and baggy bathing trunks.
90) 12) dialog: Oh, shit! Adam turns to her and is immediately awe struck. We reveal EVE RUSTOKOV. She tosses her lipstick into her purse. Eve works in the card shop and is on her way out.

90) 19) dialog: Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here-- (holds up a card)
90) 22) dialog: No, you get out of here. She closes his cigar box and gives it to him.
90) 24) dialog: No, ferry--excuse me, Jerry, I quit. She walks back to the counter to get her coat.
90) 30) dialog: Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
90) 32) dialog: Just come on. They head for the door and exit.
90) 37) dialog: I said come on! Adam exits. Jerry doesn't know what to say.
91) 2) dialog: We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
91) 4) dialog: You're lost?
91) 6) dialog: Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
91) 8) dialog: A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead. A mental picture of that causes Adam to slump against a store window and drop his box of cards.
91) 9) dialog: What's wrong with you?
91) 11) dialog: Here, pick these up! Together they pick up the cards. EVE (cont'd)
91) 14) dialog: Why doesn't that surprise me?
91) 16) dialog: Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
91) 18) dialog: Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
91) 21) dialog: Yes, I'm right?
91) 23) dialog: I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
91) 25) dialog: Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
91) 27) dialog: See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
91) 29) dialog: Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
91) 31) dialog: I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.

91) 37) dialog: Get away from me!! She runs into a parking lot.  He follows.
91) 39) dialog: Rogers Hornsby?!?
91) 41) dialog: Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!

91) 46) dialog: And that's it?
91) 48) dialog: I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?

110) 4) dialog: Take it. damn it!
110) 7) dialog: Why are you doing that?
110) 9) dialog: Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit. She heads for the front door.  He goes after her.
110) 11) dialog: Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
111) 1) dialog: I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
111) 3) dialog: Okay!  Damn! She stops, he stops.
111) 4) dialog: I should have taken the money and run! That's what Troy told me to do!  But do I listen?  No! Put your hand down! He does.
111) 6) dialog: No.
111) 9) dialog: Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
111) 11) dialog: The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
111) 13) dialog: Hey, no kidding?  In color?
111) 15) dialog: See, ya.
111) 17) dialog: What?
111) 19) dialog: Why?!  Who the hell knows?! He follows closely. She stops. EVE (cont'd)
111) 22) dialog: It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
111) 24) dialog: Doing what?
111) 26) dialog: Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
111) 28) dialog: How long would you need me?

116) 6) dialog: Night! She pulls away.

117) 4) dialog: No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
117) 6) dialog: Thank you.
117) 8) dialog: Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
117) 10) dialog: Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat. She hops in behind the wheel.  He (hurt) is a little slower getting in his side.
119) 2) dialog: Name it.
119) 4) dialog: (laughing)
119) 7) dialog: No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
119) 9) dialog: Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
119) 11) dialog: A wife?
119) 13) dialog: What for?
119) 15) dialog: Why?!
119) 17) dialog: You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
119) 19) dialog: The big one!
119) 21) dialog: Sure.
119) 23) dialog: Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.

119) 30) dialog: No dogs, huh? Okay.
119) 32) dialog: When do you need her by?

125) 13) dialog: Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
125) 18) dialog: (defensive)
125) 21) dialog: I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
125) 24) dialog: Give me your hand.

145) 61) dialog: You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!

148) 5) dialog: What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute! Troy exits into his office.
149) 1) dialog: In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
149) 3) dialog: And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!

150) 0) text: Eve hurries out of the house leaving the front door wide open.  She runs down the porch steps, across the yard, and to her car, which she unlocks with the usual fumbling.
150) 1) dialog: Come on!  Come on, damn it!
151) 3) dialog: Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
151) 5) dialog: What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
151) 7) dialog: Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
151) 9) dialog: Goodnight! Eve marches, with a limp, back to the house.
151) 11) dialog: Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
151) 13) dialog: Well, you had better!! He chases her up the porch steps.
152) 0) text: Lights are low and warm.  Adam is attempting to swab the abrasion on Eve's knee through the tear in her old sweat pants.
152) 1) dialog: Wait a minute. She reaches down and gives the knee hole a good rip, revealing her leg from above the knee to the gym sock.
152) 2) dialog: There.
152) 6) dialog: Is that what you call it?
152) 8) dialog: Sing it to me.
152) 10) text: "All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves. She reaches down, and taking hold of his collar, draws him to her and they kiss very romantically and at length. Then:
152) 11) dialog: Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
152) 13) dialog: How is that possible? During the following speech CAMERA pushes past him and lingers on her as she gradually realizes that Adam is mental.
152) 15) text: In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on Los Angeles, my parents were in our fallout shelter.  That's where I was born. We only survived because it was a huge shelter as fallout shelters go. My father worked on it secretly for years. When he had to, he used contractors, but always from out-of- state and always for just a portion of the job. He told them it was a secret government experiment done through CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he felt in this case he had no choice. Of course, it had to be a secret, because we had just enough supplies to last three people thirty-five years. That's also why I have no brothers or sisters. The air vent was the really tricky part, but he was able to cut into a flood control sewer. What I'd like to do Eve, is take you down into the fallout shelter with me. We could live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad said if I found a healthy girl I should "bring her on down". And you look plenty healthy to me.
152) 16) dialog: Uh-huh. Adam?
152) 18) dialog: I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
152) 20) dialog: That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
152) 22) dialog: My pleasure.
152) 24) dialog: Really?  Okay!
152) 26) dialog: Neat. Goodnight!
153) 0) text: Adam comes out glowing with happiness. He looks heavenward. And does his patented thumbs up. Behind him we hear Eve locking all the locks on her front door.
159) 0) text: Adam springs in, Troy drags in behind him (knowing the deal). Eve is standing away from the door next to a kind looking professional woman named Dr.Aron.
159) 2) dialog: Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
159) 15) dialog: Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
159) 17) dialog: ...I do.
159) 19) text: Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
159) 26) dialog: Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
159) 28) dialog: Oh, no!
161) 0) text: Eve and Troy run out to Aron who is dialing her cell phone.
161) 1) dialog: Oh, my God!
161) 4) dialog: No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
161) 6) dialog: No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
161) 8) dialog: You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
161) 10) dialog: I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
161) 22) dialog: Gay.
161) 24) text: Well, you're...certainly welcome! Adam gets the truck in reverse and backs out of the driveway and into a parked car.
162) 0) text: Eve and Troy arrive in her GEO to see that the two locker doors are open and much of the stuff has been carried off.  Eve drops her head in disappointment.
162) 2) dialog: (putting her head in her hand)
164) 0) text: Eve and Troy look around.  She opens a drawer and sees how nicely folded and put away things are.  Troy notices "TV Guide" and the Gideon Bible sitting out with a page marker in it.  He opens the night table drawer and takes out the cigar box.
164) 3) dialog: Give it back to him.
164) 5) dialog: We'll find him.
165) 0) text: Eve enters and looks at how tidy Adam's toiletries are; how the comb is just right in the brush; how the tooth paste (Ipanna in a '61 tube) has been squeezed from the bottom; and at how he has hung up his socks to dry.  It makes her very sad.  She picks up the toothpaste and holds it as if it were his ring.
165) 3) dialog: I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear. (starting to cry)
168) 0) text: Troy is on the phone.  Eve is standing, looking at the stock certificates.
168) 3) dialog: Have him committed.
168) 5) dialog: He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that. (beat, then)
168) 6) text: Was it ever?
168) 8) dialog: Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new. (then)
168) 11) dialog: Then what?

169) 0) text: Troy and Eve approach and enter.
170) 0) text: The Pakistani looks up briefly when Eve and Troy enter. There are two male customers in the bg. Eve taps her foot on the floor hoping to hear a hollow sound.  But it is solid.  She and Troy move about the store tapping their feet and finally jumping up and down.  The Pakistani and two customers become concerned.
170) 1) dialog: (to Pakistani)
170) 4) text: Believe me, all the really good stuff is right here.
170) 5) dialog: Is there a back entrance?
171) 0) text: The Soda Jerk drives the rental truck away leaving the lot empty and the door to the Malt Shop closed. Troy and Eve appear after the truck is gone.
171) 1) dialog: Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
171) 3) dialog: Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
173) 0) text: Eve lets Troy drive.  She clutches the cigar box and rests her head on the seat as they pull away from the curb in front of the bookstore.  A low rider passes them on the left.  Eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt shop and the cross-dressing STREET WALKER making eyes at passing cars and Adam hanging up the pay phone he just used.
173) 1) dialog: Adam!!
173) 3) dialog: Stop! She rolls down her window.
173) 4) dialog: Adam!!
173) 6) dialog: Running from the car.  The cigar box falls to the street and the contents scatter.  Eve could care less.  Besides, Troy is there to retrieve everything. In a series of cuts and slo-mo action the couple race into each other's arms...to the pleasure of all the lowlifes mentioned above.  Now the street looks more like Capra than Scorsese. She's surprised that she wants to kiss him so bad. He's surprised that he gets so aggressive.
174) 7) dialog: (stepping forward, offering her hand)
174) 11) dialog: Uh-huh. I've heard so many wonderful things about you.

177) 5) dialog: (gagging)

179) 0) text: Adam and Eve are working with a TEAM OF ARCHITECTS AND CONTRACTORS at the site of a new home. They have plans and are discussing dimensions.
179) 1) dialog: It's truly amazing what you can get done when you have unlimited funds. Did you know you can have whole houses built in just a matter of months. All you have to say is this..."I don't care what it costs."  And then, of course, you've got to really mean it, which no one ever does.
181) 0) text: Adam, Eve and Troy enter.
183) 0) text: Adam and Eve embracing as Troy picks up baseball cards and the street people look on.

184) 0) text: Eve and Troy are showing large color drawings to the Soda Jerk.  In CU we see the Malt Shop exterior all dolled up with a big lighted sign that says "GIVE ME SHELTER." There's valet parking and the Adult Bookstore and Bar have been turned into a Souvenir Center (think Planet Hollywood).  Another drawing shows fashionable guests boarding the elevator.
184) 1) dialog: It took a while to convince Archbishop Milker that Adam wasn't God, and he was pretty broken up about it, too, until I showed him my plans for Los Angeles' hottest and most original night spot. Other drawings show dancing on the shelter patio and guided tours being shown various parts of the shelter.
184) 2) dialog: You'll be a ten percent partner and still retain ownership of the entrance.
185) 0) text: A 1962 Cadillac leads a 1962 windowless van through automatic gates that have signs on them saying:  PRIVATE ROAD and NO TRESPASSING. Troy drives the van. Eve drives the Cadillac. Adam is her passenger.
185) 1) dialog: Our idea was to bring Adam's parents up to the surface very slowly.  Make them very comfortable and then break the bad news to them that there was no nuclear holocaust. And if that doesn't kill them Adam's going to tell his father about the Internet.
189) 0) text: Adam demonstrates the VCR to his parents as Troy and Eve look on.
189) 2) dialog: No!!
190) 7) dialog: Is that all right?
191) 16) text: They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
191) 17) dialog: Have you ever in your life seen a son who did more for his parents? Helen comes out with a tray of champagne cocktails.
191) 18) dialog: Adam says that this is simply how things work.  First the parents take care of the children and then the children take care of the parents. He says historically, that's how it works.
192) 0) text: Eve and Troy are sitting by the window.  Adam and Helen come in to offer cocktails to Troy and Eve.
192) 1) dialog: Whenever Adam gives me such obviously incorrect information, I just smile, slap him on the knee, and look out the window. Why spoil his dreams?  They're such wonderful dreams. The CAMERA wanders off of them and shoots out the glass doors. We see Calvin behind the house...measuring off the dimensions for a fallout shelter.
