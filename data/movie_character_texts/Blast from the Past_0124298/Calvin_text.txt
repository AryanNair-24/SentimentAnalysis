4) 0) text: Start on a CU of the HAM RADIO ANTENNA, WIND GAUGE and THERMOMETER attached to the roof of Calvin's shop. (We can hear military air traffic chatter on Calvin's Hallicrafter radio.) Then move down to the window where we see CALVIN Webber tinkering with a gadget at his work bench. Calvin's very pregnant wife HELEN appears. The music becomes source.
4) 2) dialog: Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
4) 4) dialog: You bet, hon! They exit the workshop for the house.  Calvin has left the ham radio on.
7) 0) text: Calvin is using a cocktail shaker to very carefully make Rob Roys for the crowd at the bar. It's like watching a chemist at work. Calvin's a pipe-smoker.
7) 1) dialog: So anyhow this duck says to the clerk, "I'd like to buy this lip balm."  And the clerk says, "Will that be cash or a check?"  And the duck says, "Just put it on my bill!" Polite laughter follows, but the guy out of Calvin's sight-line rolls his eyes.
7) 6) dialog: as his guests sample their Rob Roys.
7) 7) dialog: How's that?
7) 12) text: He dug a huge hole out there for a swimming pool. Then he decided he didn't want it and filled the thing in. And what's that big, high fence for? The women look at Calvin.
7) 13) dialog: with guests (one is called Harold) at the bar.
7) 14) dialog: There currently exists a type of neon light that lasts five years.  But you won't see it on the market. Same is true of batteries. I could take your simple yacht battery and rig it to last a decade, easily.
7) 16) dialog: (intense)
10) 0) text: Calvin is with another guest.
10) 1) dialog: I'd say my baseball card collection is as complete as any one I've ever seen. Ron pushes his way through the crowd.
10) 3) text: Kennedy's going toe-to-toe with Khrushchev on the television! Calvin immediately heads for the family room. Others follow.
16) 0) text: To Helen's embarrassment, Calvin is ushering  all the guests to the front door. Helen is passing out hats and purses. She and Calvin speak simultaneously - somewhere in the middle we cut outside.
16) 1) dialog: I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
16) 5) text: What'd I tell ya?! Bob whistles softly. Calvin's a nut all right.
17) 0) text: Calvin turns to Helen, a grave expression on his face.
17) 1) dialog: It's time.
17) 3) text: Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have-- He points down. HELEN (cont'd)
17) 4) text: Oh, that time! You know Calvin, I'm not sure I'm really ready for this.
17) 5) dialog: On the contrary, I think we're the only ones who are. He leads her out of shot.
18) 0) text: Calvin and Helen leave the house; cross the patio; and hurry to the shop. Back in the house, the record player has been left on:  "How Much Is That Doggie In The Window...?"  Helen is carrying the pot roast which is wrapped in foil.
18) 3) dialog: It shuts off automatically.
18) 5) dialog: No.  They all do.
18) 7) dialog: I bet that's a fighter jet on his way to Key West!  Good luck, amigo!
19) 2) dialog: You hear that?!
19) 4) dialog: We can listen to the rest downstairs! He pushes aside a table that is hiding a hatch in the floor and unlocks it by turning the hatch's wheel.  Then he opens the hatch and reaches inside to turn on a light. Red submarine light shines up from below.  All the while he and Helen are chatting:
19) 6) dialog: I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
19) 8) dialog: Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
19) 10) dialog: Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio. She steps into the hatch and onto a ladder.
25) 2) dialog: I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
25) 4) dialog: Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
25) 6) dialog: I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
25) 8) dialog: (chuckling)
27) 0) text: The Webbers step off a metal ladder and face a vault-like chrome hatchway.  Calvin opens the six-inch thick door by pushing another switch on his small box. Helen takes the roast.
29) 1) dialog: (with arms spread)
29) 6) dialog: Are you all right?! Hanging on to the roast she nods vigorously, trying to be brave.
29) 8) dialog: Oh, no!  It's happened!  Look at that heat!!  All my surface indicators are knocked out!  Oh, my Lord...it's actually happened!!
29) 12) dialog: The locks.
29) 14) dialog: To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
29) 16) dialog: Then after that it's safe.
29) 18) dialog: To go up.
29) 20) dialog: (confidently)
31) 0) text: Calvin is making sandwiches from the pot roast. Two empty Doctor Pepper bottles sit next to the stove where Calvin is heating the soda. He sees Helen enter the livingroom.
31) 1) dialog: Hi, honey! Feeling better?
31) 3) dialog: We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
31) 5) dialog: Burnt to a crisp. (indicating sandwiches)
31) 8) dialog: Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
31) 10) text: No, Calvin, you're favorite.
31) 11) dialog: Really? She walks out onto the patio. She rubs her arms as if cold.
31) 12) dialog: A bit chilly? Shouldn't be. Temperature's a nice 73 degrees. He follows her out to the patio.
31) 14) dialog: How could you?! This is just like home! A reverse angle shows for the first time the rest of the fallout shelter -- which looks very different from "home". Perhaps she starts to cry again.
31) 16) dialog: Would you like a tranquilizer?
31) 18) dialog: I told you! I've got everything! Helen groans in pain.
31) 20) dialog: What?
31) 22) dialog: Honey?
31) 28) dialog: The first child to be born on earth after the annihilation!!
33) 0) text: Calvin walks through checking things over; pleased by what he sees.  He exits. ("Hey Good Looking" continues.)
34) 0) text: Calvin checks the switch he uses to control the lights. Then he checks out all the tiny fish swimming in the six feet by six feet tank.  When he hears a baby's cry he hurries away.(Music continues)
35) 0) text: Calvin enters and smiles with great affection at his family:  Helen and a NEWBORN SON cradled next to her in bed.
35) 1) dialog: Is there a problem?
35) 3) dialog: I've noticed.
35) 6) dialog: No.  I think it's just right.
35) 8) dialog: Yes!
35) 10) dialog: What? Whatever you want, Helen! She points upwards.
35) 12) dialog: You've got it! Calvin happily gives her his patented thumbs-up sign.
35) 46) dialog: Right here!
35) 49) dialog: Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
35) 51) dialog: No reason. (then, off her look)
35) 54) dialog: Yes.  Well... yes. A sober beat, then: CALVIN (cont'd)
35) 57) dialog: What? She sets Adam (one year old) down on his wobbly little legs, steadying him at the shoulders.
38) 0) text: Calvin vaguely hears the noise made by the front loader.
39) 3) dialog: Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
39) 5) dialog: Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us! Helen ponders that statement.
39) 7) text: Look, Daddy. Alice went down a hole, just like us. Calvin smiles and messes up Adam's hair. ADAM (cont'd)
39) 9) dialog: Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
39) 11) dialog: I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches. They both look nervously up at the ceiling.
42) 0) text: Calvin is building and furnishing a classroom from materials available to him. He has had the forethought to bring down the books needed for his child's education. Little Adam is watching him.
42) 1) dialog: (to Adam)
43) 0) text: The family watches the same "Honeymooner" clip they watched before. Calvin still finds it funny. Helen wonders about that.
47) 0) text: Calvin (40) is giving Adam (8) a boxing lesson. They work from a "How To" book and use gloves made from living room pillows. Adam's pretty good. Helen appears and watches with pride. Then she interupts.
48) 0) text: The hydroponic garden area is empty. A Perry Como song begins and Adam and Helen enter waltzing. Adam has changed shirts and combed his hair. Somewhere, Calvin is watching with pride. After a while Calvin cuts in. He and Helen dance beautifully. Then they kiss. Somewhere, Adam is watching with pride.
50) 1) dialog: This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
50) 3) dialog: Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
50) 5) dialog: You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
50) 7) dialog: En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulГ€!
50) 9) dialog: Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
50) 11) dialog: (marveling)
51) 1) dialog: Hi, honey!
52) 0) text: Calvin hands Adam a cigar box. Adam opens it to see Calvin's remarkable baseball card collection.
52) 2) dialog: It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
52) 4) dialog: It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
52) 6) dialog: (chuckling)
52) 9) dialog: Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
52) 11) dialog: (slightly pissed)
53) 0) text: Start close on flashing roller skates. Then cut wider to show Adam roller skating. He passes Helen who has fallen asleep knitting in one of the lawn chairs. Then Adam passes Calvin who is on a ladder soldering a leaking ceiling pipe.
56) 2) dialog: No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
56) 4) dialog: Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
56) 6) dialog: Because he must!
56) 8) dialog: Coming! Calvin enters. CALVIN (cont'd)
56) 11) dialog: You bet. Calvin leaves while Helen lights the candles. The whole shelter goes dark. Calvin returns with two presents wrapped in whatever is available.
57) 0) text: Helen and Calvin enter singing Happy Birthday. We see the ADULT ADAM for the first time in silhouette. His handsome face is revealed to us when the cake is placed before him.
57) 2) dialog: Blow out the candles!
57) 5) dialog: Your mom made that all by herself.
57) 9) dialog: And I made these! He gives Adam the second present. Adam tears off the paper to find a pair of roller-skates that Calvin has redesigned. The new skates look kind of like rollerblades.
57) 11) dialog: Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
57) 14) dialog: If he tells, it won't come true!
57) 16) dialog: Well, we did in my family!
57) 20) dialog: One who doesn't glow in the dark.
57) 22) dialog: Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
57) 26) dialog: Yeah. Let's dig in! They do.
57) 30) dialog: If we still have one.
57) 32) dialog: You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
57) 35) dialog: Sure. Helen rises and exits.
57) 48) dialog: In the generator room again?
57) 50) dialog: I know exactly what you mean! (then)
57) 51) text: Hey, honey? She turns to him. He gives her his patented thumbs up sign. CALVIN (cont'd)
62) 0) text: Calvin wakes up. He looks over at Helen's bed.
63) 0) text: Calvin and Helen arrive followed by Adam who can't possibly share his parent's deep concerns. Everyone is out of breath.
63) 1) dialog: Should we say a little prayer first?
64) 0) text: Helen steps through and embraces Calvin joyfully.  The old folks break into a dance as Adam enters.
64) 2) dialog: (quickly back to business, and way too dramatic)
64) 5) text: Oh, shit. Helen's eyes widen and her hand flies up to her mouth. She is just as shocked as Calvin.
64) 6) dialog: Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long! (to Adam)
64) 10) dialog: It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
64) 14) dialog: C'est bon, Monsieur.
66) 7) dialog: I come in peace!! The Soda Jerk FAINTS. Calvin, sounding like a deep sea diver and having to walk like Frankenstein, goes over to the Soda Jerk and studies his face in the light of his flashlight.  He is horrified by what he sees.
66) 8) dialog: My, gosh... Calvin looks around the room and heads for the back.  He moves his Geiger counter around and gets a quiet (safe) reading. Then he removes a KITCHEN MATCH from a plastic container and strikes it against the wall.  The MATCH BURNS, so Calvin takes off his hood and visor and breathes the air.  It stinks in there.
67) 0) text: Calvin (out of the head gear and top of the suit) slowly pushes the door open and steps out. He's surprised to find an empty BODY SHOP behind the Malt Shop, where the avocado trees should be.
67) 1) dialog: Where is my backyard? He points his flashlight around and heads for the ALLEY to his left.
68) 0) text: DERELICT CARS left over from the Body Shop sit against a fence. Calvin marvels at the cars, even in their present condition.  In a TIGHTER SHOT he studies the chrome- plated word "Toyota."   A HOMELESS MAN arrives to search through the garbage. Calvin hurries back towards the avenue.
69) 0) text: Calvin emerges from the alley that separates the Malt Shop from another storefront (perhaps now a rundown Thai restaurant.)
69) 3) dialog: What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
69) 5) dialog: So...you...survived the blast, did you?
69) 7) dialog: Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
69) 9) dialog: Yes, I can tell that just looking around. (then)
69) 12) dialog: Really?
69) 14) dialog: (stumbling away from her)
69) 15) text: No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to... He breaks into a trot, heading up the street past a seedy BAR (used to be the convenience store) just as a hopelessly DRUNK HAG of a woman is shoved out and told to stay out.  Calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the curb where she TOSSES her cookies.  TWO LOW RIDERS HOP BY full of TAUNTING YOUNG HISPANIC GANG MEMBERS, one of whom BRANDISHES A PISTOL and, just for fun, points it at Calvin.  When Calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the ADULT BOOKSTORE. The young gang member pulls the trigger and we (not Calvin) see that the realistic-looking pistol is really a water gun.
70) 0) text: Calvin races in and, gathering himself, addresses the PAKISTANI MAN behind the counter.
70) 1) dialog: Hello!  How are you this evening?! Mind if I, you know, browse around?! The clerk just watches him.
70) 2) dialog: Thank-Q very much! Then Calvin turns and has his first look at the material...and he GRABS HIS HEART and SCREAMS and FALLS back KNOCKING OVER a whole ROW OF VIDEOS AND MAGAZINES.
71) 0) text: Calvin sits at the breakfast table, still breathing hard and holding his chest.  His family looks on with great concern.  The anti-radiation suit and gear is piled in the corner.
71) 1) dialog: I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
71) 3) dialog: It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now! ADAM covers his ears and hums.
71) 4) dialog: Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
71) 6) dialog: Yes.
71) 8) dialog: Believe it. He tried to sell me his body, Helen. (beat)
71) 9) text: They offer lawn furniture as a come on! She slumps, then resumes her needless activity.  Calvin takes Adam's arm and the son drops his hands and stops humming.
71) 10) dialog: They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
71) 12) dialog: We stay down here.
71) 14) dialog: Yes.
73) 2) dialog: We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
73) 4) text: No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
73) 5) dialog: Well, I am the head of this household--
73) 7) dialog: --and we will--
73) 9) dialog: --do as I say! Breathing heavily, Calvin suddenly clutches at his chest in great pain and collapses.
74) 0) text: Adam paces.  Then Helen comes out.  Behind her, we can see Calvin sleeping in his bed. She heads for the living room. He follows.
76) 0) text: Adam sets down his suitcase and goes to his father's bed. He sits. At the door, Helen dries her eyes with her apron.  Calvin indicates that he wants to whisper to Adam, who drops his ear close to his father's lips.
76) 1) dialog: Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
76) 3) dialog: ...the pipe tobacco.
76) 5) dialog: Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
76) 7) dialog: Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
76) 9) dialog: One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
79) 0) text: Helen sits sipping tea, deep in thoughts of concern for Adam. Behind her Calvin appears in the open window.
79) 1) dialog: You know-- Helen is so startled she knocks the tea all over the place. CALVIN (cont'd)
79) 4) text: Thank you, Calvin. Thank you very much. Calvin leaves, then comes back.
79) 5) dialog: He's smart.
102) 1) dialog: And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.

163) 11) dialog: You have something on your forehead.
174) 0) text: Helen watches Calvin work on the timing device for the locks with a screwdriver.
174) 2) dialog: I thought ten years.
174) 4) dialog: To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
174) 13) dialog: Some time.
174) 18) dialog: But, I don't understand.
174) 20) dialog: Well, in that case...of course, son.
174) 25) dialog: Yes, please! You must.
175) 0) text: Calvin mixes drinks just like he did at the party in 1962. Adam is with him.
177) 3) text: I'm also from Pasadena. Helen nearly comes unglued. Calvin is pleased, too. He raises his tea cup.
177) 4) dialog: A toast! To Adam and Eve! The others also raise their cups and everyone clicks. Then they drink.
177) 7) dialog: Hot Dr. Pepper! Most people don't know how good it is heated up.
177) 11) text: I like your friend, Adam. They all join hands and lower their heads. Calvin leads them.
188) 0) text: As a demonstration, Troy removes a hot cup of coffee from the microwave.  Helen is happy to see this handy new device.  Calvin, the inventor, sticks his head into the machine to investigate its workings.

190) 9) text: Calvin!  They're married!
190) 10) dialog: (offering his hand to both)

191) 0) text: Adam and Calvin exit the house. They wear baseball gloves and start playing catch. (Calvin notes the modern construction of his glove, but does not comment on it.)
191) 1) dialog: This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
191) 3) dialog: Uh-huh.
191) 5) dialog: (after a while)
191) 8) dialog: That's what everybody believes?
191) 10) dialog: What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
191) 12) dialog: Uh-huh. Adam throws the ball, but Calvin makes no attempt to catch it.
191) 13) dialog: My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
191) 15) dialog: Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh... (he can't think of another description, so he moves on)
193) 0) text: Calvin continues to measure as we pull way back and up. Perry Como sings "We'll Meet Again".
