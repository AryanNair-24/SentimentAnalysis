And,lo! There came a rumbling even as from the very bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and delivered up the vision of a young man whose countenance caused the Soda Jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his face and to weep in fear.  And, Adam, taking pity on the man, put down his suitcase, and went to him, saying:

Then he sees two men arguing violently. Gradually late day turns to night and Adam becomes more and more depressed. Then he sees something. He is elated. He jumps up and tells the driver:
88) 17) dialog: Driver! Stop this bus immediately! Please sir!!
89) 0) text: The bus stops mid-block and Adam gets off. He crosses the street causing only one car to hit the brakes. On the other side of the avenue we see what has gotten his attention. It's an ADULT BOOKSTORE much like the last one we saw (probably owned by the same chain.) He's happy but when he looks next door he sees he's in a different place. Sad and lost he turns north and starts to walk until -- a billboard catches his attention. We pan up to see a billboard for liposuction that features an almost NUDE WOMAN. Adam is struck by the image and we spend some time cutting between him and it. Then gathering himself he turns and begins to walk south.

He flips open the cigar box to reveal to Jerry riches beyond his wildest dreams.  Jerry actually moans and then must pretend the moan was a cough.
90) 6) dialog: I was thinking of selling all the cards.
90) 8) dialog: See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
90) 10) dialog: Oh, that would be wonderful!
90) 14) dialog: Bon soir, mademoiselle!
90) 16) dialog: No. (then, thinking fast)

91) 36) dialog: I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
91) 38) dialog: Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
91) 40) dialog: He's all yours. I was holding him back. Adam takes a Hornsby card from his coat pocket and shows it to her.
91) 42) dialog: So what?!  I've got two of him! (removing more cards from his pocket)

125) 52) dialog: Sorry, that's the largest city. Troy jumps up and runs out of the room.
125) 53) dialog: Where's he gone?
125) 55) dialog: He has a computer?
125) 57) dialog: In the house?
125) 59) dialog: May I please be excused?
125) 62) dialog: This must be very new.
125) 64) dialog: It's so small.
125) 66) dialog: I don't think so.
125) 68) dialog: No.

125) 75) dialog: (indicating computer)
125) 78) dialog: Oh, yes. (to himself)
125) 81) dialog: Yes. He likes windows.
125) 83) dialog: ...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
129) 0) text: Adam's impeccable table manners serve to highlight Eve's and Troy's utter lack of same.
129) 4) dialog: All right.
129) 10) dialog: The what?
129) 22) dialog: The guy with the underpants!
129) 26) dialog: I'm not wearing his pants.
129) 28) dialog: I just don't want to.
129) 35) dialog: About clothing?
129) 37) dialog: Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo. Eve and Troy watch him eat for a beat or two.
129) 39) dialog: No.
129) 41) dialog: It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair! She does. Eve and Troy emulate Adam.
130) 0) text: Troy and Adam get out of Eve's car with a lot of packages. They head for the house.
130) 1) dialog: I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
130) 3) dialog: The recovery is very impressive.
130) 5) dialog: Amazing. I'm very impressed.
131) 0) text: Eve is on the couch doing her toenails when Adam and Troy enter. Adam is in a casually elegant outfit that looks terrific. Both he and Troy are carrying lots of other packages and garment bags. We see names like Gucci, Armani and Lauren. Eve is visibly impressed by Adam's makeover.
131) 4) dialog: But first let me show her these! He reaches into a bag and removes a box that contains -- a pair of rollerblades. ADAM (cont'd)
132) 0) text: There is a most unusual band shell location on the beach that is completely covered by graffiti. Eve and Troy sit at one of the many stone tables watching Adam skate all over the place. He wears spandex workout pants and a T- shirt. The starting CRANE SHOT begins on the nearly deserted commercial section of Venice Beach and then takes us to the band shell.
132) 4) dialog: Okay! He heads out of the band shell. We follow him as he skates into an area that has been given over to the homeless. They sit around in their sleeping bags and blankets and cheer (and jeer) Adam when he passes by. He takes them to be more mutants.
133) 0) text: Adam skates to it and is amazed to see two very pretty girls skating in their tiny bikinis. A nearly nude body- builder guy goes by on a bike. Then Adam sees the ocean.
134) 0) text: Adam tosses off his roller-blades and walks trance-like towards the waves.
134) 2) dialog: Adam raises his arms to greet the ocean, perhaps like a Plains Indian would. Then he joyously runs into the surf and dives.
134) 6) dialog: He surfaces and throws his fists in the air.
134) 9) dialog: 
134) 10) dialog:

140) 3) dialog: Yep. (then watching the rain hit the palm of his hand)
140) 6) dialog: I certainly do!
140) 8) dialog: (rising)
140) 11) dialog: Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
140) 13) dialog: (taking her by the arms)
140) 16) dialog: Thank Q, Eve! She's uncomfortable with the hug. Wait a minute. No she's not.

141) 1) dialog: Why did you park way back there?
141) 3) dialog: Oh. I see. Eve looks like she owns the place.
142) 0) text: As they enter Adam grabs Troy, who is leading the way.
142) 2) dialog: Ladies first, Troy! That was close. Adam and Troy follow Eve in. The club is NOISY AND HOPPING. The house music is from the 40's. Adam, Eve and Troy enter a long corridor of booths and walk forward. Adam's got on that terrific dark suit. Women notice. Eve notices them noticing.
142) 3) dialog: My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
142) 9) dialog: Do I look crazy?
142) 15) dialog: Holy Mo-ly, Miss Pay-o-ly!! This place is neat-o!! Adam enters the main room. Eve and Troy follow.
143) 3) dialog: How do you do?! It's very nice to meet you, Jason and Jonathan! (confidentially, to them)
143) 11) dialog: Hello, Sophie, I'm Adam Webber.
143) 14) dialog: Tu parle Francais? Tu a un tres bon accent.
143) 16) dialog: Paris!! La ville de lumieres! C'est bien rencontrer quelqu'un pour pratiquer le francais.
143) 19) dialog: Good-bye!
143) 21) dialog: I thought I was here to meet women.
143) 23) dialog: I like her.
144) 0) text: Adam, Eve and Troy examine female patrons over drinks. It's white wine for her, imported beer for Troy, and a Rob Roy for Adam.
144) 2) dialog: It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
144) 5) dialog: What about her?
144) 7) dialog: Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
144) 9) dialog: Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
144) 11) dialog: How 'bout this one? "This one" is a KILLER BLOND.
144) 16) dialog: Okay. I like that.
144) 19) dialog: (to Troy)
144) 23) dialog: Really?
144) 27) dialog: That's ridiculous.
144) 32) dialog: (very serious)
144) 37) dialog: Okay. Thank you, my friends. Adam rises. ADAM (cont'd)
144) 40) dialog: Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.

145) 1) dialog: Hi!
145) 4) dialog: (beat, then)
145) 7) dialog: (big smile)
145) 11) dialog: Thank-Q! They both laugh.
145) 15) dialog: I'm Adam Webber.
145) 18) dialog: "Heather?"  I don't believe I've ever heard that name before. There's a slight beat before both girls laugh.
145) 24) dialog: Really?
145) 26) dialog: I took a dance lesson everyday of my life until a couple of days ago.
145) 28) dialog: No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
145) 30) dialog: She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
145) 46) dialog: No. Would you please excuse me?
145) 48) dialog: I will certainly try.  And thank you both very much for the dance. He leaves.
145) 55) text: Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure! Troy rises and exits.  Adam arrives and sits down.
145) 56) dialog: You wanted to see me!
145) 58) dialog: Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
145) 60) dialog: I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
145) 62) dialog: No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you. (off her look)
145) 65) dialog: All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
145) 67) dialog: Hello, Cliff, how are you this evening? Cliff barely shakes his hand.
145) 70) dialog: Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
145) 80) dialog: Please excuse this interruption.
145) 82) text: Adam steps closer, looking past Cliff at Eve.
145) 83) dialog: Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
145) 85) dialog: I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
145) 90) dialog: Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
145) 95) dialog: (lowering his guard)
145) 96) text: Yes, I agree. Cliff draws back another right.  Adam flicks out a quick left to Cliff's cheek, again snapping his head back, but not his body. (These aren't big movie hits.) Cliff takes a beat or two then draws back his right fist again.  Adam pops him in the nose. Cliff drops his right arm to his side.
145) 98) dialog: I'm sorry.
145) 101) dialog: (lowering his guard)
145) 105) dialog: (turning to Eve)
145) 106) text: Eve, I'm sorry. Seeing an opportunity, Cliff rears back with another right. Adam deftly pops him in the mouth again with a short right jab.
145) 110) dialog: But, Eve, I would--
151) 0) text: She jumps in and sticks the key in the ignition.  Adam appears at the passenger window.
151) 1) dialog: Hi! Eve SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as she throws open her door and jumps out into the street where she falls down, hurting her knee.  Adam runs around the car to help her to her feet. Dogs start barking in several houses.
151) 2) dialog: Eve?!
151) 4) dialog: I'm really sorry!
151) 6) dialog: I know...and I'm really sorry.
151) 8) dialog: What?
151) 10) dialog: Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
151) 12) dialog: I know first aid!
152) 0) text: Lights are low and warm.  Adam is attempting to swab the abrasion on Eve's knee through the tear in her old sweat pants.
152) 3) dialog: Thanks. He takes the back of her calf in one hand and applies the antiseptic to her knee with the other.  It stings and she flinches.
152) 4) dialog: Steady. Steady.  It's going to be all right in no time. He leans down and blows on the wound.  CU of that.  CU of his hand on her calf.  CU of her looking down at him, watching as he blows gently on her knee.
152) 5) dialog: I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
152) 7) dialog: But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
152) 9) dialog: (softly, saying it as much as singing it)
152) 12) dialog: No. She sits up.
152) 14) dialog: (sitting up)
152) 17) dialog: Yes, Eve?
152) 19) dialog: Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour. He rises.  She gets up and leads him to the door.
152) 21) dialog: Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
152) 23) dialog: It was at least as good as the sky.
152) 25) dialog: And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
153) 0) text: Adam comes out glowing with happiness. He looks heavenward. And does his patented thumbs up. Behind him we hear Eve locking all the locks on her front door.
155) 0) text: Adam struggles with the gears as Troy worries about his driving skills.
155) 2) dialog: Wait a minute! He promptly pulls over and turns off the engine.
155) 4) dialog: No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back! Adam jumps out of the truck and runs off.
156) 0) text: Adam runs up.  The bookstore looks familiar.  Adam runs to the next store. It's a bar.  He runs to the next store.  It's the Malt Shop.  Adam is thrilled.  He tries the front door and at first it does not open.
158) 0) text: Adam jumps in.
158) 1) dialog: Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
158) 3) dialog: You bet!
158) 5) dialog: What?
158) 7) dialog: (concentrating on his driving)
158) 11) dialog: Does that work?
159) 0) text: Adam springs in, Troy drags in behind him (knowing the deal). Eve is standing away from the door next to a kind looking professional woman named Dr.Aron.
159) 1) dialog: Hi, Eve!
159) 4) dialog: How do you do?
159) 6) dialog: Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
159) 8) dialog: Hello. He nods politely.
159) 10) dialog: Come where?
159) 12) dialog: For how long?
159) 14) dialog: I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
159) 16) dialog: ...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
159) 18) dialog: (to Aron)
159) 21) dialog: Yes, ma'am. The two come forward.  One opens the door and one beckons for Adam to step out.
159) 23) dialog: Goodbye. Adam looks back at Eve, who looks away. Adam exits.
160) 0) text: Adam races down the sidewalk.  He cuts left and runs between houses.  Brown is not as fast.
161) 12) dialog: The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards! (running to the truck)
161) 17) dialog: (starting the engine)
161) 20) dialog: And thanks for always being happy!
161) 24) text: Well, you're...certainly welcome! Adam gets the truck in reverse and backs out of the driveway and into a parked car.
163) 1) dialog: Mom?!  Dad?!  I'm home! They jump up and race into the living room, meeting Adam halfway.   The parents kiss and hug their son before noticing that he's got the Soda Jerk with him.
163) 2) dialog: I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
163) 4) dialog: ...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
163) 6) dialog: I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
165) 0) text: Eve enters and looks at how tidy Adam's toiletries are; how the comb is just right in the brush; how the tooth paste (Ipanna in a '61 tube) has been squeezed from the bottom; and at how he has hung up his socks to dry.  It makes her very sad.  She picks up the toothpaste and holds it as if it were his ring.
166) 0) text: Adam, the Soda Jerk and fifteen followers hurriedly unload the truck, taking provisions into the back door of the malt shop.
172) 2) dialog: Uh, Eve...this is Adam.  Look, I just wanted to thank you for everything you did for me...and I wanted to tell you that I...uh...that I wish so many good things for you. I wish so hard that all of your dreams come true. Um...I, uh...
173) 0) text: Eve lets Troy drive.  She clutches the cigar box and rests her head on the seat as they pull away from the curb in front of the bookstore.  A low rider passes them on the left.  Eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt shop and the cross-dressing STREET WALKER making eyes at passing cars and Adam hanging up the pay phone he just used.
173) 5) dialog: Turning when he hears Eve yell his name.
174) 5) dialog: Mom?  Dad? They turn to see Adam walking forward with Eve.
174) 6) dialog: I'd like for you to meet Miss Eve Rustokov. Calvin knows a Russian name when he hears one. But he chooses not to pursue it.
174) 15) dialog: Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
174) 17) dialog: I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
174) 19) dialog: And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
174) 23) dialog: We have to go.
174) 26) dialog: Well...sure...okay.
175) 0) text: Calvin mixes drinks just like he did at the party in 1962. Adam is with him.

182) 0) text: This is great stuff from the fifties and the sixties. Adam finds things very similar to what he grew up with. There's a lamp (or something) that's just like the lamp (or something) from the Webber living room.
182) 1) dialog: That lamp is perfect!
183) 0) text: Adam and Eve embracing as Troy picks up baseball cards and the street people look on.
183) 1) dialog: Eve, I've got to go back! My parents can't handle this up here. And there was no bomb, was there?
183) 3) dialog: See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
183) 5) dialog: My mother's like that. They kiss again.

191) 7) dialog: Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
