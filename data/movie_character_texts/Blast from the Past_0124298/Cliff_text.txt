122) 0) text: CLIFF is leaving with a cardboard box full of clothes. He is exceedingly GOOD LOOKING AND IN VERY GOOD SHAPE. Eve and Adam come up the steps.
122) 1) dialog: What are you bitching about now?
122) 3) dialog: I forgot some of my stuff.
122) 6) dialog: Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
122) 10) dialog: I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself? (eyeing Eve)
122) 13) dialog: Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat! Cliff smiles and bounces down the steps.
122) 19) text: Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
145) 66) dialog: Well, well, well.  Don't we clean up nice? Cliff steps up to the table.  Adam, automatically a gentleman, rises and offers his hand.
145) 68) dialog: Not bad. Then he sits in Adam's seat.
145) 69) dialog: But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
145) 71) dialog: (to Eve)
145) 74) text: Sure. They rise.  Cliff gestures to the chair.
145) 75) dialog: It's all yours. Eve and Cliff go to the bar.  Adam sits down glumly.  He looks across the room and catches the eye of Miss Sweet who is seated at a table with Heather.  A GOOD LOOKING GUY is hitting on them.  CUTTING BACK AND FORTH between Adam and them we see Miss Sweet's smile escalate.  Then she nudges Heather who also looks over and smiles. Adam smiles back.  Finish with a CLOSER SHOT OF HIS POV of Miss Sweet's hair, butt and legs.
145) 79) dialog: You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
145) 81) dialog: Oh, brother...
145) 82) text: Adam steps closer, looking past Cliff at Eve.
145) 84) dialog: What?!
145) 86) dialog: (the shallowest guy in the world)
145) 89) dialog: Yeah. Before I kick your ass. He gives Adam a shove.
145) 91) dialog: Do ya? Cliff throws a right which Adam calmly blocks and counters with a short right jab to Cliff's mouth, snapping his head back.  It's not a big punch, but very, very quick. It makes Eve mad and astonishes Troy, Jason and Jonathan.
145) 93) dialog: (slightly insecure)
145) 96) text: Yes, I agree. Cliff draws back another right.  Adam flicks out a quick left to Cliff's cheek, again snapping his head back, but not his body. (These aren't big movie hits.) Cliff takes a beat or two then draws back his right fist again.  Adam pops him in the nose. Cliff drops his right arm to his side.
145) 99) dialog: (increasingly insecure)
145) 103) dialog: Eve? I'm leaving.
145) 106) text: Eve, I'm sorry. Seeing an opportunity, Cliff rears back with another right. Adam deftly pops him in the mouth again with a short right jab.
145) 107) dialog: (deeply insecure)
145) 108) text: Well, good night, everyone. Troy, Jonathan and Jason say good night to him.  Cliff walks unsteadily away bleeding from the mouth and both nostrils. (Hopeful that no one has noticed that he's very subtly just gotten the crap beat out of him.)
