150) 0) text: Eve hurries out of the house leaving the front door wide open.  She runs down the porch steps, across the yard, and to her car, which she unlocks with the usual fumbling.
152) 10) text: "All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves. She reaches down, and taking hold of his collar, draws him to her and they kiss very romantically and at length. Then:

156) 0) text: Adam runs up.  The bookstore looks familiar.  Adam runs to the next store. It's a bar.  He runs to the next store.  It's the Malt Shop.  Adam is thrilled.  He tries the front door and at first it does not open.

Eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt shop and the cross-dressing STREET WALKER making eyes at passing cars and Adam hanging up the pay phone he just used.
