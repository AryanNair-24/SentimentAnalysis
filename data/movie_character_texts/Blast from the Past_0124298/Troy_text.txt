124) 1) dialog: (sotto)
124) 4) dialog: Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse. He rushes out with the tray.
125) 0) text: Troy enters with sushi appetizers. Adam is looking at the ceiling.
125) 2) dialog: I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?

125) 25) dialog: (to himself)
125) 33) dialog: That's right?
125) 36) dialog: She's right?!
125) 39) dialog: Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
125) 42) dialog: Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
125) 45) dialog: Who use to own it?
125) 47) dialog: When did we get it from them?
125) 49) dialog: What's the capitol?
125) 51) dialog: Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
125) 63) dialog: Yeah.
125) 65) dialog: What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?

125) 77) dialog: Yeah?
125) 80) dialog: He's a Windows guy then, huh?
125) 82) dialog: Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
125) 84) dialog: True. Troy exits. Adam follows. (EDITORIAL:  Scenes 131, 132, and 133 should follow scene 134 rather than precede it.)
129) 0) text: Adam's impeccable table manners serve to highlight Eve's and Troy's utter lack of same.

129) 7) dialog: (looking Adam over)
129) 13) dialog: You're serious, aren't you?
129) 15) dialog: It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
129) 17) dialog: I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
129) 19) dialog: I see "elegant."
129) 21) dialog: That's what I'm sensing.
129) 24) dialog: (indicating Adam)
129) 27) dialog: Why not? He has great pants.
129) 29) dialog: Okay.
129) 31) dialog: Alright, I will.
129) 34) dialog: What do you think, Adam?
129) 38) dialog: Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
130) 0) text: Troy and Adam get out of Eve's car with a lot of packages. They head for the house.

130) 4) dialog: The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
131) 0) text: Eve is on the couch doing her toenails when Adam and Troy enter. Adam is in a casually elegant outfit that looks terrific. Both he and Troy are carrying lots of other packages and garment bags. We see names like Gucci, Armani and Lauren. Eve is visibly impressed by Adam's makeover.
131) 1) dialog: Well, what do you think?
131) 3) dialog: Let me show you the entire trousseau!
131) 6) dialog: (making it sexual)
132) 0) text: There is a most unusual band shell location on the beach that is completely covered by graffiti. Eve and Troy sit at one of the many stone tables watching Adam skate all over the place. He wears spandex workout pants and a T- shirt. The starting CRANE SHOT begins on the nearly deserted commercial section of Venice Beach and then takes us to the band shell.
134) 5) dialog: He's from Alaska.
134) 8) dialog: That's why little things mean so much to him.

142) 0) text: As they enter Adam grabs Troy, who is leading the way.
142) 1) dialog: What?!
142) 5) dialog: Bored even. Adam gives it a shot and goes too bored.
142) 6) dialog: Vaguely bored! He gets vaguely bored but misses unimpressed by a mile.
142) 11) dialog: Be loose. He overplays that.
142) 13) dialog: Always good advice.
143) 5) dialog: He's from Alaska!
144) 0) text: Adam, Eve and Troy examine female patrons over drinks. It's white wine for her, imported beer for Troy, and a Rob Roy for Adam.
144) 13) dialog: Eve?!
144) 15) dialog: Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
144) 21) dialog: Um... Eve?
144) 29) dialog: Ah-ha! There's " Miss Sweet."  At the hors d'oeuvres table!
144) 36) dialog: Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
144) 42) dialog: I'm not sure I want to watch this. Eve puts her hand to her head -- hating herself and still not  sure exactly why.
145) 36) dialog: 
145) 37) dialog: You know, he's a very, very good--
145) 42) dialog: Must you... Eve points at Adam and beckons broadly for him to come over -- a basketball coach calling her player off the floor.
145) 43) dialog: What in the hell is wrong with you?!!
145) 54) dialog: Right here? (then, off her look)
145) 55) text: Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure! Troy rises and exits.  Adam arrives and sits down.
145) 108) text: Well, good night, everyone. Troy, Jonathan and Jason say good night to him.  Cliff walks unsteadily away bleeding from the mouth and both nostrils. (Hopeful that no one has noticed that he's very subtly just gotten the crap beat out of him.)
146) 0) text: Troy takes out his keys as he approaches the front door. But the door opens. Eve stands there in sweats. Agitated.

147) 2) dialog: We did not leave together.
147) 4) dialog: What's it to you?!
147) 6) dialog: Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.

148) 2) dialog: To bed.
148) 4) dialog: Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
149) 2) dialog: Yes, you do.

149) 6) dialog: Yes, you do!
149) 8) dialog: (sitting up)
149) 13) dialog: He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
149) 15) dialog: Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
149) 17) dialog: From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
149) 19) dialog: He didn't leave with them.
149) 21) dialog: He left with Sophie.
149) 23) dialog: It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
149) 25) dialog: What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
149) 28) dialog: (cringing)
149) 31) dialog: Gentleman coward, to you.

155) 5) dialog: Without question, the strangest man I've ever met.
158) 2) dialog: How 'bout we check with Eve first?
158) 4) dialog: So, did you buy a movie?
158) 6) dialog: A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
158) 9) dialog: (laughing in agreement)
158) 12) dialog: Yeah...Seems to. Adam would not have thought that.
159) 0) text: Adam springs in, Troy drags in behind him (knowing the deal). Eve is standing away from the door next to a kind looking professional woman named Dr.Aron.
159) 22) dialog: Good-bye, Adam.
159) 25) text: You'll be hearing from me. She shuts the door. Troy sits dejectedly.
159) 27) dialog: I know...I know. You did the right thing. Eve goes to the window and watches as WE SEE ADAM BREAK FROM BROWN AND RUN OFF with him chasing.

162) 0) text: Eve and Troy arrive in her GEO to see that the two locker doors are open and much of the stuff has been carried off.  Eve drops her head in disappointment.
162) 1) dialog: I guess he took what he could.
162) 4) dialog: Fallout shelter. She gives him a look. TROY (cont'd)
164) 0) text: Eve and Troy look around.  She opens a drawer and sees how nicely folded and put away things are.  Troy notices "TV Guide" and the Gideon Bible sitting out with a page marker in it.  He opens the night table drawer and takes out the cigar box.
164) 1) dialog: This it? Eve nods.
164) 2) dialog: What do you want to do with it?
164) 4) dialog: And if we can't find him?
165) 1) dialog: Hey, Eve?  Eve? He enters with stock certificates and sees that she's very close to crying.
165) 2) dialog: What's wrong?
165) 5) dialog: See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid. Instead of taking the certificates, she hands him the toothpaste and sits down on the bed in a funk. TROY (cont'd) (looking at the toothpaste)
167) 0) text: Their pal Jason is on the phone with Troy.
168) 0) text: Troy is on the phone.  Eve is standing, looking at the stock certificates.
168) 1) dialog: Thanks, Jason. He slams down the phone and jumps to his feet.
168) 2) dialog: Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
168) 4) dialog: Yeah! That's thinking.
168) 7) dialog: I don't know. I like to think so.
168) 10) dialog: To get some frozen poultry.
168) 12) dialog: We came back to the house!
168) 14) dialog: No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
168) 16) dialog: An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
168) 18) dialog: Trendy address. They exit.
169) 0) text: Troy and Eve approach and enter.
170) 0) text: The Pakistani looks up briefly when Eve and Troy enter. There are two male customers in the bg. Eve taps her foot on the floor hoping to hear a hollow sound.  But it is solid.  She and Troy move about the store tapping their feet and finally jumping up and down.  The Pakistani and two customers become concerned.
171) 0) text: The Soda Jerk drives the rental truck away leaving the lot empty and the door to the Malt Shop closed. Troy and Eve appear after the truck is gone.
171) 2) dialog: None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
171) 4) dialog: Yeah.  Maybe he'll call. They turn left to get back to the avenue.

183) 0) text: Adam and Eve embracing as Troy picks up baseball cards and the street people look on.
184) 0) text: Eve and Troy are showing large color drawings to the Soda Jerk.  In CU we see the Malt Shop exterior all dolled up with a big lighted sign that says "GIVE ME SHELTER." There's valet parking and the Adult Bookstore and Bar have been turned into a Souvenir Center (think Planet Hollywood).  Another drawing shows fashionable guests boarding the elevator.
185) 0) text: A 1962 Cadillac leads a 1962 windowless van through automatic gates that have signs on them saying:  PRIVATE ROAD and NO TRESPASSING. Troy drives the van. Eve drives the Cadillac. Adam is her passenger.
