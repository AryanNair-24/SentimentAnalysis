61) 1) dialog: Who did this? (turning on RL) I might enjoy lazing around, too. I could walk out the front door and say I was going to pick blackberries! Just wave goodbye and wander off. No, you want to be served, but you don't want to have any responsibilities in return. You're going to have a record, and it's going to follow you around the rest of your life. On it will be the grades you made -- what you accomplished and what you didn't. People read it. If you mess up, you might not be able to get a security cle ice. People will ask why.

65) 4) dialog: Sit on the front two inches of your chair. It's good for your posture. I read it in the paper. He holds up a rock before Jack's eyes, a thunder egg from children's collection, a sort of polished agate.
65) 5) dialog: You actually bought this from Mr. Ledbetter? Don't explain. Just nod. Yes or no.
65) 7) dialog: I don't know how long I can keep paying for these rocks. We're living in a fancy neighborhood, but we can't afford this house. If Kimball next door knew what our situation was, he would laugh. Of course, he got all his money from his father-in-law.

She wonders if her hus does not take some pleasure in punishing the boys. The mo tortures are harder on them than the physical ones. His suspicious glances, his mouth curling in scorn, the sentimentality that so quickly spills over into cruelty. What is she to do? Confronting him only makes the situati worse.

84) 1) dialog: Bishop Sheen was down the hall -- two doors away. Very friendly. The French are lovable, but they'll rob you blind.

The Norwegians would drive by and laugh! (she smiles) You boys don't realize it, but we're skating on thin ice. You live in peace, quiet, in warmth. Look at the Food you have. Still on your plate! The abundance ! When I was our age, T was chomping tickets at the Clar Theater in Chicago. (Jack squirms ) Are you ina hurry? After the shows, I cleaned the bathrooms. For years I had one pair of pants. The same green pants! I had to run around in my shorts while my mother washed them. And still, for all that, father was always father to me. Nobody knows what that means these days. Can a child understand? It seems to Jack that he and his brothers remain alive through their father's sacrifice and bear their lives as undeserved gift from him. His father has bred in him a de suspicion of himself, a doubt of his every action; a doub others, too, and of their motives. He is becoming anxious about everything; wavering, unable to work out a thought. 82. There is a loud crash. He let the screen door slam shut.
84) 8) dialog: You can't shut it softly, can you? No, that's too hard for you, I suppose. You don't have the time. That's too much to expect of our worthy son. Horsefeathers!
