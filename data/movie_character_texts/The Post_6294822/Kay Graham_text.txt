59) 11) dialog: Oh no. Honestly, I’m not even quite sure where to begin.
59) 13) dialog: Growing up, we always had to be scarce. Out of sight and all. I never wanted that for my children but - now. Well. It’s quiet again.
59) 15) dialog: (shaking her head) I raised you to have your own lives. It would be hypocritical of me to ask for them back. 107.

59) 22) dialog: People thought I must have been devastated when your grandfather picked your father to run the company instead of me.
59) 24) dialog: No. I was... proud. Your father was the smartest man I’d ever met. When your grandfather chose him it was like, well, it was like he chose me. Because Phil had been my choice.
59) 26) dialog: It’s different for you. Your generation - women can get away with having expectations -
59) 29) dialog: I keep wandering into your father’s office. Hoping that I’1l find something new there. A journal or a letter - telling me what I’m supposed to do next. What steps to take - If I made the right ones.

60) 9) dialog: As I said, I’ve been in this business nearly my whole life and never, never, have I seen a story that displays such a wanton disregard for the public interest. To have hidden these decisions made without the people’s knowledge that resulted in decades of torture, murder, and oppression. Bradlee is stunned by the power of her words.
60) 10) dialog: My father, when he stepped down, issued a press release. He said, “The citizens of a free country have to depend on a free press for the information necessary to the intelligent discharge of their duties of citizenship. That is why the Constitution gives newspapers express protection from Government interference.” It... it might have taken me a little while longer than my father would’ve hoped to truly understand these words but... I believe them to be true. It is my responsibility to stand behind my staff and the truth of their convictions to tell this story. It is our duty. Meg and Howard are rapt with attention. A shock to them b

And my decision to publish these papers is one that could put into jeopardy the lot of it. She almost looks back at Bradlee, but keeps her eyes forw 111.
60) 12) dialog: However, if the decision is made by the courts to side with the government, and the Washington Post ceases to exist, I can think of no stronger mark to leave than by taking a stand for what is right. And there will have been no greater honor in my life than to be beside the men and women of the Post while we attempt to do just that. Her voice shakes, Bradlee’s eyes are glassy but he covers

63) 17) dialog: (conspiratorial grin) I didn’t trust you the whole time either, Mr. Bradlee.
63) 19) dialog: Being the victim doesn’t really suit me. All it does is open a door for more people to judge you. Criticize you. And, I guess, one day you have to just decide not to allow them to do that anymore.

64) 16) dialog: I think it deserves just another conversation —
64) 18) dialog: Not with The Times again - 117. They walk into Bradlee’s office, where we stay outside in bullpen and watch through the glass.
