8) 19) dialog: It’s only June.
8) 23) dialog: That was years ago.
9) 0) text: Kay slams the proposal onto her desk, furious. Her office tasteful, mid-century modern with personal touches throughout: photos of her children, etc. Fritz walks in a closes the door behind him.
9) 2) dialog: That was a long list. 15.
9) 4) dialog: I don’t know if relaxed is the term I'd use but, yes, I think you’re preoccupied with the negative.
9) 6) dialog: (calm) The IPO has been approved. With your shares, the estate’s shares... it’s a good day.
9) 8) dialog: That’s because you’ve always had it. She gives him a sharp look, but he’s not wrong.
9) 9) dialog: This is what the paper needs to keep going. You know that. She nods. Her face softens, the mask of confidence beginn to drip away. A moment passes. Beat.
9) 11) dialog: That’s not their style.
9) 13) dialog: Downstairs? She nods, he shrugs.
9) 14) dialog: I never got involved in Post business. Phil hated it.
9) 16) dialog: Well, Phil... He loved having the ink stains and all that. Fighting it out. Your father... Eugene liked to be a part but not a player.
9) 18) dialog: There were issues with both - the public thought Phil was too involved. Even you've said that. Maybe your father not enough. But both of them understood the difficulties of the post. You have to be able to command the board and the bullpen. (laughing) And neither had to fend with Ben Bradlee in charge.
9) 20) dialog: Who?
9) 22) dialog: I think they do. Do you? She’s not sure. Kay’s secretary, LIZ HYLTON (30s), Fritz rises to leave. Kay nods.

27) 8) dialog: So you'll agree, it’s damning.
27) 10) dialog: To the White House.
27) 12) dialog: And this morning the White House filed an injunction against the Times. It was approved an hour ago.
27) 14) dialog: A restraining order. The Times is prohibited from printing anymore of the documents until there is a hearing. Kay smiles, letting Fritz fight for her.
27) 15) dialog: So I’m just confused - do you want us to embarrass the White House or stand with them? Ignatius stutters.
28) 0) text: Kay and Fritz approach her office.
28) 1) dialog: That’s not going to hold him back - he’1l figure out another way to discredit you in front of the Board.
28) 3) dialog: (hesitating) Technically no. But he can call a vote to have you removed and that will put into question the -
28) 5) dialog: I’m afraid so.
28) 7) dialog: Don’t worry, if Phil wasn’t booted off, you have nothing to worry about. She nods her head - unsure. A moment passes.

28) 13) dialog: We can’t get pulled into some kind of legal battle over this, Kay. Not now. It could jeopardize -
28) 15) dialog: Let’s hope not. He moves off, she’s more concerned now than ever. She approaches Liz’s desk, there is a stack of letters.

43) 16) dialog: (forcing a smile) I think I’1l find my way.
44) 7) dialog: I hate to barge in. Clark stands and shakes Fritz’s hand.

44) 15) dialog: (to Clark) Go ahead.
44) 26) dialog: (to Bradlee) The Post is going public next week. Bagdikian looks up - surprised. Bradlee is disappointed.
44) 27) dialog: Our IPO is contingent on a series of steps and markers that will ensure to the -
44) 29) dialog: It’s not always about winning, Ben.
44) 31) dialog: That’s not your decision. A tense beat. Bradlee hates that Fritz is right.
44) 38) dialog: Ben - Bradlee walks towards the door.

50) 21) dialog: It’s my job to -
50) 25) dialog: (scowling) Don’t be dramatic. Bradlee’s eyes don’t leave Kay’s.

53) 8) dialog: Yes.
53) 20) dialog: We’re going to court. Today. They’11 try and prove we knowingly published something that was a danger to the US government.
53) 22) dialog: Not as glamorous as you thought, is it. (beat) I’1l call when I have more news. For now... keep them writing. (MORE )
53) 24) dialog: We’ve opened the door. No reason closing it until they order us to.
