19) 22) dialog: This entire proceeding is offensive, Caiphas. I have heard nothing from these so-called witnesses but false accusation, dissention, contradiction. The speed with which you've assembled this Tribunal is, in my view, further evidence of malice. Yours and theirs. A number of men nod in agreement, cover their heads in a gesture of disapproval. Some simply LEAVE the Tribunal. Most, however, erupt into loud jeers. They start to push JOSEPH and some of the other dissenters around, then literally SHOVE them out the door. JESUS watches his few supporters leave or be thrown out. CAIPHAS is filled with secret pleasure as JOSEPH and the good men leave the TRIBUNAL. As soon as they are gone, he turns to JESUS again. The noise dies down.
