5) 5) dialog: (low, edge of hesitancy) Who are you? JESUS slowly stands up, He does not dignify the question an answer, nor even look to the reptile at His feet.

Torches. SOLDIERS. Then the TWO MEN CARRYING the LOG they lifted from across the CEDRON TORRENT. The group STOPS. MORE TORCHES as MALCHUS and JUDAS’ gang do not stop, but SOLDIERS greet/insult each other with familiarity. MALCHUS and a SECOND OFFICER step in, order silence and separate the two groups, shoving their men forward. As th two parties separate, MALCHUS takes JUDAS by the arm
