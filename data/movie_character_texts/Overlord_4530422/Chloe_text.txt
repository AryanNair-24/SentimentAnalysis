17) 10) dialog: (thru tears) Outside Cielblanc.
17) 12) dialog: Yes.
17) 14) dialog: Three kilometers, that way. Ford and Boyce brush past her, moving some foliage aside: town of Cielblanc is a tiny dot, nearly a mile from here.
17) 17) dialog: (so hopeful) This was your target? Cielblanc? You liberate us? They don't answer. Overhead, more planes groan. Then Ford stiffens. Just heard something else: A VEHICLE, approaching. Ford and Boyce know that sound. 22.
17) 19) dialog: No. Play dead.
17) 21) dialog: Please, listen to me. If they get you we'll never be free of them. Ford whips around, looking for a hiding spot. Then he stops. Truth is there's no better option out here and he knows it. So, although he HATES this plan... He leans back. Boyce and Tibbet too, their eyes SHUT. For turns his back to the road - his eyes OPEN - positioning TRENCH-KNIFE like a mirror so he can see the road, as:

19) 17) dialog: Then please, be careful for the other houses. There are collaborators here. (Boyce eyes Ford) It's the Nazis - they have poisoned this place... Good luck. Ford nods. Chloe rises, heads home. The G.I.'s watch her ..-until she has slipped quietly into her HOME. It has an ATTIC WINDOW that overlooks the town. Ford notes it.

46) 13) dialog: The only soldiers he's ever seen are Nazis. I wanted him to know better. Chloe crosses to a junk-pile, pulls out a hand-made CRUTC carved from a tree-limb. She hands it to Ford.

46) 17) dialog: You make too much noise.
46) 19) dialog: Do you need anything else? Water?

47) 5) dialog: Every house in this village has a story like that. If Boyce had time, he'd sit down and discuss it. But he doesn't. He heads for the window, then crouches low besid it, timing that SEARCHLIGHT out there. Chloe drifts over. On a table is a PHOTO, taken 5 YEARS AGO: Chloe-at-14, wi what must be her mother and grandfather and Annelise, and Chloe's (now-dead) father, ALAIN, holding Paul (at 2). Boyce notes it, just for a second, then looks outside aga
47) 6) dialog: Is there anything I can do to help? Anything you need?
47) 8) dialog: You can't leave it standing. Okay? (Boyce half-turns...) The church. When you kill those men, you have to blow it up or burn it - but don't just leave it there. Can you do that? Can you bury it? Boyce pauses - regards her and her grandmother - the trag of war right there on their faces. It touches him. 46.

Then, from the other door, Chloe's MOTHE This is MARIE-ELENA, pure steel, embittered by war. She mentions the lateness of the hour to Bruel, in French. He snaps back at her angrily. Marie-Elena eyes the floor. BACK TO THE ATTIC - Ford peeks through that knothole now. And sees Annelise for the first time. What the??? Boyce n DOWNSTAIRS - Annelise is silent, stoic. Wafner asks, in German, "Where's the boy?" Chloe tightens. If Wafner goes those steps, WE'RE ALL DEAD. So, aloud:

Paul reappears at the bottom of the steps now. Chloe hand him his marble. He nods, thanks. Apologizes to Bruel. Then Paul and Chloe and the rest of the family STAND IN A LINE like soldiers at Roll Call, shoulder to shoulder. All eyes on Wafner and Bruel. A silent, agonizing moment. ..-until Dr. Bruel opens his bag, pulls out a SYRINGE, an approaches Annelise, her arms coal-black and blistered. Boyce and Ford watching. Bruel drifts BEHIND her, kneels down, finds a suitable ve in the back of her knee. Her leg has bruises all over it, like a junkie. In goes the NEEDLE. Annelise silent. ...as he draws her blood - which is BLACK. Not red. Not dark red. BLACK. Boyce and Ford stare in disbelief. Oddly, Annelise's family doesn't react at all. Bruel calmly caps his syringe, takes out another... ...and moves on to Guillaume, who sticks out his arm - wh is when we see that HIS FINGERTIPS ARE BLACK. Both hands. Bruel draws blood - also BLACK - from Guillaume's right a Boyce and Ford watching, dazed... Bruel caps syringe #2, uses a ruler from his bag to measu the BLACKNESS on Guillaume's right hand. A FINGERNAIL ext awkwardly. Bruel yanks it off. Guillaume doesn't feel it. But Ford and Boyce sure do, wincing. Then Bruel asks Annelise to stick out her right hand. That's impossible for her; the tissue is just dead. The a won't move. Guillaume reaches over, lifts it for her. A gesture of great kindness, but sad as hell. 49. Bruel examines her right hand. Taps on it. Once. Twice... And it falls off. Right there, on to the floor. Chloe gasps. Paul cries. Boyce and Ford stunned. WHAT THE FUCK?! But there it is, on the floor - her bloodless HAND, dead tissue. Guillaume fights back a tear. Marie-Elena too. Pa trembling. Annelise is stunned, but oddly unpained. ...-as Bruel makes a dispassionate note in a NOTEBOOK, an mumbles something to them in French. Then he closes up hi bag, and says to Wafner, in German, "Let's go." Wafner says what must be "I'll be along in a moment." Bruel shrugs, turns to go. Marie-Elena calls out to him w a question. Bruel brushes her off with:

56) 1) dialog: That really ought to be looked at. Chloe, at the top of the steps, gestures to Ford's blood- soaked pantleg. An uneasy tension between them. Ford shrugs, "Go ahead." Chloe crosses past Wafner and si She unties Ford's boot; he keeps his eyes out the window despite the searing pain. Mission, mission, mission. She pulls the boot off. AGONY. Ford just grits his teeth. Chloe pulls up his pantleg, pulls down his bloody sock - regarding what one of her traps did to a human leg.

His shoulder's been bandaged, the bur on his abdomen field-dressed. He sits up, slowly... Rosenfeld lies on a nearby cot. Grunauer is tending to hi But there's no Ford, of course. And no Chloe. Boyce rises 103. First few seconds on his feet are pretty wobbly. His knee want to give way, but he makes them stiffen. And everyone around here is too preoccupied to notice. He takes a first halting step for the barn door - then notices something to his right, a STANDING CURTAIN, partitioning off one patient from the rest. He hears a familiar voice behind it.
