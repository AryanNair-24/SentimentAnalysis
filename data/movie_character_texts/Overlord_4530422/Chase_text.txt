2) 1) text: Most of the paratroopers are praying now. We bounce arou catching glimpses of PFC. CHASE, Gurkin, and Rosenfeld:
2) 2) dialog: God, just let me hit the ground safely. I'll take it from there.
26) 4) dialog: You see anybody else?
26) 6) dialog: This is Penner, five-oh-eighth, B- Company. Lost his whole stick.
26) 11) dialog: Let's move out. Just then, a NOISE - a RUMBLING SOUND coming this way.
26) 12) dialog: Hold it. They HALT, and turn: it's a WEHRMACHT TRUCK, crossing pastureland, its HEADLIGHTS just about to hit us.
26) 13) dialog: Hit the dirt! Down they go, ready for a firefight. Here comes the TRUCK But it TURNS RIGHT, toward the FOOTHILL. They watch it go bounces over a bump, KER-CHUNK, an item nearly falling ou the back of the truck: A DEAD BODY. A fallen German soldier.
26) 15) dialog: On me. Let's go. Hugging the tree-line, they follow the truck. Boyce notes back of Penner's flamethrower. It says "Hitler Hunter."
28) 0) text: Boyce, Tibbet, Chase, and Penner reach the spot where the truck descended, and they STOP - just saw something odd:
28) 1) dialog: What the??? A WIDE RAMP has been BULLDOZED into the EARTH out here, l a driveway descending into an unseen garage, directly ben the church. It's guarded by heavy BLAST-DOORS. ANCIENT STONES decorate the "overpass" above the ramp. On stones are RUNIC SYMBOLS, (ancient letters). A large SWAS has been added dead center, flanked by two SS INSIGNIAS. The truck awaits entry. Then the BLAST-DOORS open... and truck's HEADLIGHTS show us where this ramp leads: darknes CAVERN. But we don't see any GUARDS - nothing moving. The truck rolls down the ramp. The blast-doors remain ope beat. Chase thinking...
28) 3) dialog: I don't know - but I wanna take a look. (no one volunteers) Might be our best shot at getting inside the church. Sounds like a horrible idea to Boyce, but he's silent.
28) 5) dialog: You and Penner come with me. Boyce, you stay up top and cover our backs. 32.
28) 7) dialog: Why not you? Let's go. Tibbet doesn't like it, but he follows Chase and Penner d the earthen ramp - just DARKNESS at the bottom of it. Wha the hell is down there? Boyce stands watch, 20 feet back. ..-until Chase, Tibbet, and Penner enter the DARKNESS at bottom of the ramp, gone from our view now. Boyce STOPS. SILENCE. Boyce spots something shiny at his feet. It's a DAGGER, decorated by a DEATH'S-HEAD and runic symb and a SWASTIKA. And the letters SS. Boyce examines it. Wh would the SS be out here? He pockets it. Then, suddenly-- RIFLE FIRE from the darkness of the cavern. Lots of it. B drops to a knee - rifle slung, heart pounding. MORE RIFLE FIRE. He's all alone on this ramp... MORE SHOTS. He rises, takes a step down the ramp, when-- FLAMES pierce the darkness at the bottom of the ramp - we can't see their source - followed by a SCREAM from Penner then MORE SHOTS, ANOTHER SCREAM - then Chase yelling:
28) 8) dialog: GO GO Go! Boyce staring at those FLAMES in the DARKNESS - as: Chase and Tibbet race back up the ramp bearing their rifl running for their lives, terrified. They sprint up the ra right past Boyce - it's all a BLUR:
28) 10) dialog: Run! Run!
30) 0) text: That SEARCHLIGHT BEAM slaps on, emanating from the CHURCH A shitstorm. Boyce running for cover. At the edge of the PASTURE he sees Tibbet, frozen in fear - a few feet from where Chase exploded. Boyce grabs Tibbet.
34) 0) text: KLAXON wailing. Boyce and Tibbet crouching low. From here they can see one of those SS GUARDS (PRIVATE RICHT) eyein the remains of Chase in that field. The OTHER TWO SS GUARDS are in the cavern at the bottom o the RAMP. We hear a FIRE-HOSE, extinguishing the fire. Then... silence. The Klaxon is shut off. Only the searchl remains. Pvt. Richt heads down the ramp. ...leaving Boyce and a very shaken Tibbet:
