4) 11) dialog: Hey, Boyce. Why you always chattin' everybody up all the time? This ain't a cruise-ship. Ford's reaction is instant: THE ICIEST GLARE OF ALL TIME: not mess with Boyce or you are messing with ME. It lands Tibbet instantly retreating:
4) 12) dialog: Chat away. See if I give a damn. Ford is the Alpha in this stick. Silence hovers... until:
14) 9) dialog: No. How many of us made it out?

But it throws enoug FIRELIGHT to show us a PARACHUTE stuck in a NEARBY TREE t stands along a country lane, ROAD 13. The guys get to their feet and head for that tree. GUNFIR echoes in the DISTANCE. They cross over Road 13, to:
15) 6) dialog: Did the detonator get banged up?
15) 8) dialog: Make it fast - awright, Boyce? Boyce climbs, his head on a swivel - feels awfully VISIBL but that's his buddy up there... More GUNFIRE in the nigh Boyce keeps climbing. He's 15 feet off the ground, when:
16) 8) dialog: Goddammit! Boyce and Ford trade a look - two G.I.'s, hanging on - in middle of the forest in the middle of the night in the mi of a war. Ford calmly reaches for the tree-trunk. ..-and shimmies down. Boyce follows, speechless as ever a Ford's unflappable calm. They reach the ground.
17) 2) dialog: Almost took my damn head off.

18) 1) dialog: What the hell's she doin' back there? (no one answers) Makin' me nervous... Up ahead, the Germans on foot order the POW's to leave th road, pushing them past a CRUMBLING WALL that marks the entrance to CIELBLANC. Half-Track continues down the road 24. As the G.I.'s get closer, we get our first look at the to 20 houses, a few barns, a well, a gallows... And, on a FOOTHILL overlooking the town, a Gothic CHURCH. It's BIG, rimmed by a tall GATE; a RADIO-JAMMING TOWER ri from the church's roof. Stained glass, flying buttresses. The G.I.'s trade looks. Behind them, Chloe checks ANOTHER TRAP. This one empty. The G.I.'s hurry toward that crumbl town-wall and take cover behind it...
19) 1) dialog: Now what?
19) 3) dialog: Yeah? With what for ordnance - your Zippo? Nobody knows where Gurkin is.
19) 5) text: That shut Tibbet up. The moment hangs... as Chloe arrives
19) 12) text: Listen, Sister. Au_revoir. Okay? 25. That stung her. Ford glares at Tibbet: I'll do the talkin Again, Tibbet backs down.

23) 0) text: Boyce and Tibbet stay low - the town at their back. We he odd ANIMAL CRIES in the night, distant FIREFIGHTS. The wh forest feels alive around us, creepy as hell. Boyce pulls out his METAL CRICKET. CLICK-CLACK, CLICK-CLA 27. Tibbet does it too. Nothing. They keep moving, searching. Then, up ahead, SMOKE and METAL become visible--
23) 1) dialog: Boyce! It's a downed C-47, a DEBRIS FIELD of twisted metal, rubb and glass. They wade in... Then Boyce sees it, at his feet - a piece of TIN FLOORING used to be part of the FUSELAGE. It has words written on "82nd Airborne. We came to liberate France. June 5, 1944. Good God. Their plane, in sections now. Sobering as hell, scary too. They start clicking their CRICKETS again - thr the smoking pieces of a dead plane. Boyce finds its NOSE dug into dirt. "My Gal--" the rest o the name buried. He keeps moving, until: An ANIMAL SOUND startles him - growling, snorting. Boyce edges around the crippled nose of the C-47 to find: ...a WOLF, chewing the forearm of our dead pilot, McKean. Boyce hisses at the wolf. It backs off grudgingly, nearin another one of those ANIMAL TRAPS. Boyce hisses again. The wolf changes course, narrowly side-stepping the trap. Boyce turns back toward the fuselage... But SOMETHING GRABS HIS ANKLE. He turns, terrified-- At his feet is Gurkin, who lies stiff - a PROPELLER BLADE poking through his chest. Literally. But he's alive.
23) 5) dialog: Gurkin, ya got the explosives?
23) 7) dialog: Ya got ‘em, Gurkin? Gurkin nods. Tibbet reaches into Gurkin's trouser pockets BLOOD SPURTING from Gurkin's chest onto Boyce's hands - a Tibbet extracts FOUR TETRYTOL BLOCKS (they look like C-4)
23) 8) text: Tibbet pockets them; Boyce just trying to compose himself
23) 13) dialog: I'm gonna find Grunauer. And Tibbet backs away - leaving just Boyce and Gurkin. Gurkin's eyes are pleading. Boyce pulls out his sidearm, hand shaking... aims the weapon at Gurkin's head. But he can't do it. No way. He shakes his head.
25) 0) text: Boyce follows Tibbet toward a dark stretch of woods. CLIC CLACK, CLICK-CLACK. No reply. Boyce tries again... This t we hear _a CHIRP IN REPLY. Maybe 50 yards away.

28) 4) dialog: You wanna be a hero, be my guest.
28) 6) dialog: Hey! Why me?
30) 0) text: That SEARCHLIGHT BEAM slaps on, emanating from the CHURCH A shitstorm. Boyce running for cover. At the edge of the PASTURE he sees Tibbet, frozen in fear - a few feet from where Chase exploded. Boyce grabs Tibbet.
30) 1) dialog: Landmines...
34) 0) text: KLAXON wailing. Boyce and Tibbet crouching low. From here they can see one of those SS GUARDS (PRIVATE RICHT) eyein the remains of Chase in that field. The OTHER TWO SS GUARDS are in the cavern at the bottom o the RAMP. We hear a FIRE-HOSE, extinguishing the fire. Then... silence. The Klaxon is shut off. Only the searchl remains. Pvt. Richt heads down the ramp. ...leaving Boyce and a very shaken Tibbet:
34) 2) dialog: I don't know. I don't know! An SS guy, we put ten shots into him - he musta had body-armor on; guy just kept coming! He tore Penner apart!
34) 4) dialog: I don't know! Chase gave the order to get outta there, I wasn't gonna argue. At the bottom of the ramp, the BLAST-DOORS close. Christ.
36) 0) text: Boyce and Tibbet reach the rendezvous site, that CRUMBLIN WALL. The SEARCHLIGHT BEAM sweeps and scans. And there's sign of Ford. Tibbet, shaken, masks it with rancor: 35.
36) 1) dialog: 4:10. Where's your buddy? Boyce doesn't know. He wishes he did...
38) 2) dialog: Orders were to stay here, remember?
38) 4) dialog: I got the ordnance. Guys carrying ordnance stay put.
38) 6) dialog: You wanna risk your neck go ahead. I don't like the guy enough to get killed for him. Tibbet's not moving. Boyce backs away.
40) 2) text: Boyce crouches down, his eyes peeled. The wall itself obscures our view - but Boyce can see tho six Germans approach Tibbet... and his HANDS as they go u ONE GERMAN takes Tibbet's rifle. Another offers him a smo A THIRD ONE FIRES AT HIM, POINT-BLANK. Goodbye, Tibbet. Boyce recoils, accidentally stumbling over the HEADLESS D almost falling. That makes a noise. He FREEZES. The six Germans don't turn; they're too busy - throwing TIBBET'S BODY on the SIDECAR of a Zundapp motorcycle. One SOLDIER starts it up, noisily. Tibbet's body draped limpl Just like that, the motorcycle blows through the Square a up the narrow road - passing right by Boyce... -..and onto the CHURCH GROUNDS. Gates close behind it. Boyce is aghast, confused... and completely alone.
55) 2) text: A CEILING-TO-FLOOR CURTAIN divides the lab in half. On th side of it we see endless rows of LAB-STATIONS, EQUIPMENT sinks, burners, beakers. A pair of EYEBALLS in a jar... Oh, and 25 DEAD GERMAN SOLDIERS, on GRANITE SLABS. These are the BODIES Boyce saw trucked in; each has been stripped down to white BOXER SHORTS and rubbed with oil. ..-but every gunshot wound, every hole left behind by an exploding shell, they're all evident. Boyce winces a bit. Covering the walls are RUNIC LETTERS and paintings of ANC TEUTONIC KNIGHTS. Swastikas too. And two crossed CEREMONI AXES, right out of the Middle Ages. In a glass cabinet are 500 VIALS OF BLACK BLOOD. One sits a GAS STOVE in a POT OF BOILING WATER. Boyce turns the st off. And hears a MACHINE-LIKE SOUND: A pump, sounds like it's on the other side of that CEILIN FLOOR CURTAIN. Boyce steps through it, rifle slung - and the OTHER HALF of this vast lab... It's a horror: FIFTEEN PEOPLE - "SUBJECTS" - barely human now, each of t TIED BY THEIR HANDS AND FEET TO HOSPITAL BEDS. They were villagers once. Now they look more like CREATUR Their flesh is black and blistered, everywhere - necrotid tissue bubbling on their arms, faces, necks, torsos. Thei eyes milky white, staring in a state of sustained torture On each bed Boyce finds a "PATIENT FILE" complete with BE AND AFTER PHOTOS - human decay, chronicled in German. Bes one of the beds, a 16 mm. CAMERA stands on a tripod... He drifts a bit closer, breathless. These people are bare alive, most of them unconscious, some of them vegetative; something is corroding them from the inside out: Connected to each villager is a machine of pumps and valv an AUTOJECTOR, pumping a thick black substance - looks li TAR - into each subject, circulating it mechanically. On BOTH ARMS of every subject are BLOOD DRAWS, feeding bl blood into bottles that sit on the floor. It's like a massive, gruesome dairy farm. But why??? Boyc drifts past each bed, shocked, speechless. Then, another shock - AUTOJECTOR #16 is connected by TUBE a_DISEMBODIED DOG'S-HEAD, which sits on a tray. 63. Somehow, impossibly, the Autojector is keeping the head alive. Its MOUTH moves - just took in a breath. My God... Autojector #17 is hooked up to a HUMAN HEART, beating, suspended in air by STRINGS over the OPEN CHEST of Tibbet Tibbet's EYES have been removed. Holy Hell. Boyce shaken. Then, behind him, labored BREATHING. He turns, rifle slun In BED #3 is another villager/creature, suffering, tied u his body entirely BLISTERED and BLACK. His eyes crazed. B stares - something drawing him toward this creature, when A JUMP-SCARE - it BOLTS UP - still tied to the bed but lunging at Boyce with such force that the bed actually TOPPLES OVER, slamming on its side to the floor. That fas Boyce steps back, the Creature now pressed against the fl its breaths rattling. Boyce not sure what to do, as:
