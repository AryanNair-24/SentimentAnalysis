Chloe screaming. Boyce gets to his feet. 80. --Ford thumping his way down the stairs-- Wafner reaches the door, opens it. An insane moment. He carries her away, Chloe screaming:

They descend down the ramp, toward DARKNESS. ...crossing under the ANCIENT RUNIC SYMBOLS and the SWAST One last look at the symbols, wondering what they mean. T Ford and Boyce vanish into the pitch of the Cavern... INT. CAVERN UNDER THE CHURCH —- CONTINUING It's big. First thing we see down here is a burned-out TR the one that carried in all those German bodies. Beside it we find TWO CHARRED CORPSES. It's hard to say f sure, but one of them looks it was once a German soldier. other looks like it might've been Penner. Gruesome. Ford and Boyce move around a corner... to find: 83. A DERRICK, pumping something from a BIG HOLE IN THE GROUN A HOSE from the derrick is connected to a large BARREL, w is OVERFLOWING with a thick black substance. Tar. Trouble is, there's a GERMAN standing beside the derrick- It's Scherzer, the guy who received the injection from Br Scherzer's still in his white boxers, his back to us, sta down into the HOLE from which that derrick is pumping... There's a GAPING WOUND across his back. Clearly, it's wha killed him. But he's alive now, the BLOOD from that wound calcified black. So how do we kill him??? Boyce and Ford trade a silent look. Boyce raises his rifl aiming... but Ford stops him with a silent headshake. The no point in trying to shoot this guy. Then Ford sees it... affixed to a wall: The FIRE HOSE. Boyce saw it used last night. Ford crutche toward it. Boyce follows. The hose is coiled around a WHE Boyce starts to UNCOIL IT. It squeaks, LOUD. He stops. Scherzer, twenty feet away, doesn't turn - just staring i whatever is down there, obviously unsettled. Ford moves to the FAUCET - a red knob. He indicates to Bo "When I turn this knob, you start RUNNING TO UNCOIL THE HOSE." Boyce nods. A moment, their eyes locked, then-- FORD TURNS THE RED KNOB - loud and squeaky. Scherzer turns at the sound-- Boyce starts running at him with the hose. Scherzer reaching for his RIFLE. Ford turning the knob harder - full blast. The hose UNCOILING off the wheel as fast as Boyce can run WATER EXPLODING OUT OF THE NOZZLE - too hard - the burst actually knocking Boyce off his feet. Scherzer grabs the rifle, turns to fire, YELLING-- ++.asS Boyce gets to one knee, aiming the hose, and... 84. BAM - it hits Scherzer in the chest - just as he FIRES. BANG - the bullet hitting a JUNCTION BOX a foot to Ford's left. Instantly, the POWER GOES OUT. And Scherzer is knocked off his feet, right into: ...the HOLE IN THE GROUND beside the derrick. Gone. A beat. Ford turns the water off. Boyce lowers the hose. And they move in, cautiously, toward the edge of the hole Ford crutching his way there... Then he looks down to see .+.-a POOL OF BLACK GUNK below. Scherzer's HAND sticking
67) 10) dialog: Now he knows what it tastes like. A beat... Then Ford takes out his father's ZIPPO, lights it... and holds the flame to that overflowing barrel.
67) 12) dialog: If it'll burn, we gotta burn it. I wouldn't even want our side to know what this stuff can do. That fast, the TAR in the barrel IGNITES, highly flammabl The flames dance across that HOSE, through the DERRICK, t down into the hole just as-- JUMP-SCARE: Scherzer reaches up out of the tar - gasping. But the tar-pool ignites - a MASSIVE WALL OF FLAME ERUPTI FROM IT, knocking Boyce and Ford on their asses. The FLAM ROAR OUT... then suck back down again. Boyce and Ford crawl to the hole, look down - the CHARRED REMAINS OF SCHERZER seared into place among the flames. FORD (CONT’D) Guess they burn too. Boyce rises, offers his hand - just like Ford pulled Boyc onto that C-47 last night. Ford takes the hand, as-- A STAIRWELL DOOR OPENS, ten feet away. Here's Kiebel, ano guy we killed once before - checking on that JUNCTION BOX But he sees Boyce, and Ford, and the FIRE. 85. And he charges them - unarmed but roaring-- Boyce and Ford FIRE THEIR RIFLES out of instinct. It does make a dent. Black blood spurting from his wounds, Kiebel barrels into them both. Ford falls hard. Boyce and Kiebel tumble together to the cavern floor, RIGHT BY THE SURGING FLAMES. Kiebel's on top of Boyce in a hurry, hands around Boyce's throat - trying to choke him out. Boyce can't stop him - Nazi is undead and way too strong. The heat is scorching. Ford jumps on Kiebel's back, grabs Kiebel's head, pulling hard as Boyce gasps for breath. Ford TUGS. We hear that s single liquid SNAP we heard from Lesner when her neck bro ...except Kiebel doesn't stop. With his HEAD now dangling an unnatural angle, he keeps strangling Boyce. Ford, no choice, SLITS KIEBEL'S THROAT... Now black blood gushes from it onto Boyce. And STILL KIEBEL DOESN'T STOP. He's a monster, literally his grip on Boyce's throat unrelenting. Barking in German Ford, no moves left, pulls out his SIDE-ARM and fires it right into Kiebel's right WRIST. The bone shatters. Then LEFT WRIST. That bone shatters too. His grip on Boyce loosens. Boyce sucks in a breath. Then huge burst of energy - pushing Kiebel away and-- ...toward the edge of that hole, into the FLAMES. Kiebel's CLOTHES ignite. One MORE PUSH from Boyce and-- Kiebel vanishes down the hole, SCREECHING as he falls. And it's over. Ford and Boyce eye one another - Boyce now drenched in the black blood of a dead Nazi.
67) 14) dialog: See? Simple. Boyce, soaked in black, just eyes him--

70) 4) dialog: Tower ain't enough anymore, Ed. This whole place has to come down. Boyce eyes the Villager-Subjects. Heads toward them-- Ford heads for the BACK WALL, passing by that SEVERED DOG HEAD, kept alive by the Autojector. He can't resist: FORD (CONT’D) (at the dog-head) Stay. The head, of course, doesn't move. Boyce begins to UNTIE THE CREATURE from Bed #1. A FEMALE, face completely blistered-black. Boyce frees her hands.
70) 6) text: He grabs for his SIDE-ARM, cursing Boyce loudly in German Boyce takes another swing. THWOP - severing the guy's LEF HAND. Now this German is really angry - howling at Boyce. Boyce moves in - the German unable to defend himself - Fo watching in semi-shock from a corner... One last swing. Boyce beheads him. Down he goes. Two head Nazis, side by side. Crisis over. Ford slightly awed by w he just witnessed. A moment... then:
70) 7) dialog: They teach that move in Basic? I musta been sick that day. Ford's way of saying, "Nice work." It mattered a lot.
70) 9) dialog: No. Go find Chloe, get her out of here. I'll set the charges. Boyce nods, helps Ford to his feet-- As he does so, Ford slips something into Boyce's pocket, Boyce entirely unaware.

81) 4) dialog: Thunder. Ford's VOICE, at last. Boyce whips the beam toward it-- ..-and he freezes, his blood just congealing-- Here's Ford - sitting on an exam table. BLACK BLOOD now spilling from the wound on his BELLY.
81) 7) dialog: Yeah? Wait. That didn't sound like Ford; it had an ugliness to He hops off that table and starts toward _us - walking on shattered ankle, impervious to pain. And his RIFLE is slung, aimed right at us.

God and Country... or Cowardice?

Around him, on cots, lie SEVEN WOUNDED SOLDIERS. We see I.V.'s, DOCTORS, works. Lesner's TRUCK has been moved out. And the U.S. Army, clearly, has moved in. Boyce is shirtless. His shoulder's been bandaged, the bur on his abdomen field-dressed. He sits up, slowly... Rosenfeld lies on a nearby cot. Grunauer is tending to hi But there's no Ford, of course. And no Chloe. Boyce rises 103. First few seconds on his feet are pretty wobbly. His knee want to give way, but he makes them stiffen. And everyone around here is too preoccupied to notice. He takes a first halting step for the barn door - then notices something to his right, a STANDING CURTAIN, partitioning off one patient from the rest. He hears a familiar voice behind it. Marie-Elena. Boyce m to the curtain. Grunauer notices:
