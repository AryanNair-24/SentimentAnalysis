3) 49) dialog: Another view of Vejle. I don’t know how you can paint the same thing over and over. Einar misses a beat.
3) 51) dialog: Could you please not speak to Rasmussen about me again... My work is my business. Stay out of it. But she disappears into the bedroom, the door slamming emphatically behind her. Einar’s left bewildered.
3) 54) dialog: I have my period.
3) 56) dialog: Are you? She turns to find him approaching.
3) 60) dialog: Could you help me with something? Einar’s relieved to be able to help.
3) 62) dialog: Ulla has an extra rehearsal. She cancelled again. Would you try on her stockings and shoes? Einar’s discomfort erupts in a laugh. Is she serious? GERDA (cont'd) I'm just so behind. I don’t know how I’11 be finished in time for her opening... But he cuts her off:
3) 64) dialog: Hvappe... Gerda mixes paints. Einar battles with the stockings. GERDA (cont'd) That’s backwards... He fiddles with the second stocking now, a light sweat de his forehead by the time he’s rolled both to the knee. He opens a shoebox: - the yellow pair from the shop window.

3) 72) dialog: I haven’t asked you to. She get sit... lays it across him. GERDA (cont'd) Would you just relax...? The sooner I start, the sooner I finish. Einar yields reluctantly, as Gerda runs her fingers gentl down his face. Satisfied, Gerda returns to work. Einar’s breathing feels slightly laboured now. The dress weighs heavily. His head moves slightly, feeling it brush his neck. His fingers curl involuntarily around the beade cuff. The SOUNDSCAPE becomes heightened: the creak of Gerda’s easel, the jangling of her bracelets, the sound o the harbour, the wind in the ships’ riggings. These combi fill his head... until:
3) 78) dialog: Such concentration. Sometimes when you're working, I think you’re going to slip through the surface of the painting and vanish. He smiles a little. GERDA (cont'd) Sink into the bog. Like your friend’s kite when you were a boy.

3) 125) dialog: I don’t know... She remembers, drawing Einar into the recollection. GERDA (cont'd) But we went for coffee, and after, I kissed him... and it was the strangest thing... it was like kissing myself. A look between Einar and Gerda, a connection crackling.
3) 129) dialog: Turn it back on. He looks at her. She shrugs, smiles - it’s her turn, afte all... He turns it back on, a little awkward now, undress in front of her. She sees this, toughs it out, watching h anyway. GERDA (cont'd) Were you really corrupted by my ankles? Einar wears just his shirt now, begins to unbutton.
3) 131) dialog: I still am. Einar peels off his shirt. Underneath, he wears Gerda’s l edged slip. Gerda GASPS slightly... Einar has outdone her with this imaginative twist. But she rises to the occasio Feels the fabric against his body. (CONTINUED)
