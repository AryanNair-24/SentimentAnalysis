13) 40) dialog: Oh, for Christ's sake, Theodore,  this is about as intimate a situation  as you can get, you, me, and Angela  here. It's pretty cozy. To say nothing  of how stupid an idea it is to lie  to a man with a loaded gun without  considering the possible response. I  demand an apology!
13) 42) dialog: Don't move. I've got to take this.
13) 43) text: Sigfried glances at it. Then to Angela. He picks up the p

13) 57) text: Ted repeats what Sigfried has told him. This appears to h a calming effect on Sigfried, who gets up off the floor,  turning his face to Angela.

13) 62) dialog: (continuing) You always gotta get the last word,  don't you? It's one way with you,  Angela, isn't it? I give and I give  and I get nothing back.
13) 63) text: Sigfried turns to Ted.
13) 64) dialog: (continuing) She just sits there waiting for me  to jump through hoops...

You're absolutely right,  love cakes, I wouldn't want it that  way. That's one thing you can say  about Angela. She'll never do anything  she doesn't want to do. If the feeling  ain't there, she just isn't going to  do it. There is nothing in this world  as fucked as a woman who gives when  she doesn't want to. Never let that  happen to you, Theodore. It makes  you feel very little indeed.

13) 75) dialog: That you think I'm an idiot.
13) 77) dialog: You think you're superior to me,  don't ya, Theodore? You don't think  I notice there is a gag in the woman's  mouth.

13) 81) dialog: Because I PUT THE GAG IN HER MOUTH!  I'm gonna let you in on a little  secret about communication, Theodore.  It's all in the eyes... (points the gun at  Ted) Him? (turns the gun on  himself) Or me? Him or me? No one? Okay. Let's  drag it out.

18) 86) dialog: You ever been out on the ocean at  night?
18) 88) dialog: (continuing) I have... scary as a motherfucker,  all that darkness around you. It's  like a big black carpet rolled out  as far as the eye can see. Sometimes,  if you're lucky, you'll see a light.  It could be as small as a little  spark, but it will cut a path straight  through all that blackness, straight  to you. It could be another boat, or  some distant fire on an island, but  that light will shed a shining path  of diamonds cutting through mile  after mile of darkness to lie at  your feet.
