And standing in the middle of the biggest room in hotel is the hottest, newest comedy star to burst onto th Hollywood scene in nearly a decade: Chester Rush. At this moment in time, he's the king, and he has the swagger of new king. After only one movie, he's pulled the sword out the stone. And the look on his face says, "King's good."  Surrounding him is his entourage. They all look like once upon a time this evening they were dressed sharp; however at this late hour, everybody looks about as disheveled as Ted. One of the lads, Norman, has planted roots in a comfy cha with his leg thrown over the arm and a bottle of Jim Beam his hand. The second guy, Leo, is in the back of the room pacing ba and forth on the telephone. He is completely oblivious to the rest of the room's activity. In Chester's hand is an ever present glass of champagne,  which he constantly spills as he gestures wildly. Around room are the leftovers: pizza boxes, fast-food hamburgers and empty bottles of Cristal Champagne.
