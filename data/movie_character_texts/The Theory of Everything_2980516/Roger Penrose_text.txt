18) 1) text: ROGER PENROSE, MATHEMATICIAN, gives a passionate talk before a small audience in a small room. The blackboard i crammed with calculations and diagrams. 
18) 5) dialog: How about a simple diagram? 
18) 7) dialog: A star, more than three times the size of our sun... 
18) 9) dialog: ...ought to end its life, how? With a collapse, the gravitational forces of the entire mass overcoming the electromagnetic forces of individual atoms, and so collapsing inwards. If the star is massive enough, it will continue this collapse, creating a black hole - where the warping of spacetime is so great that nothing can escape... not even light. It gets... 
18) 11) dialog: Smaller, smaller... 
18) 13) dialog: The star, in fact, gets denser as atoms--even subatomic particles-- get literally crushed, smashed into smaller and smaller space. And at its end point what are we left with? 
18) 15) dialog: A point. A spacetime singularity... 
18) 17) dialog: With extraordinary properties! Infinite density. Space and time come to a stop. All of the known laws of science--they just stop working.
18) 20) dialog: What I've just shown is that this happens in every black hole. Its really happening, out there. To real stars--and its happening right now!
