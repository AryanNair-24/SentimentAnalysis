Marlon drinks b from a can while Truman addresses a teed-up golf ball wit number three wood. The headlights of their two parked car light the cement "fairway". Their target is a sign at the far end of the bridge proclaiming, "THE SEAHAVEN CAUSEWAY Linking Seahaven Island With The Rest Of The World - Your Dollars At Work" - an upturned plastic cone at the foot o the sign is the "hole". Truman winds up and swings, making healthy contact with t ball. The ball arches away into the night sky. From a new angle we see the ball take a huge hop on the outside lane the abandoned freeway and continue down the asphalt beyon the sign.

53) 6) dialog: Tru, we've known each other since before we were in long pants. The only way we ever made it through high school was cheating off each other’s test papers. Jesus, they were identical. I always liked that, because whatever the answer was-- Truman chimes in, nodding fondly at the-memory.
53) 8) dialog: The only night either of us ever spent in jail, we spent together and I wet myself but you never told anyone. I was best man at your wedding and my brother was best man at my wedding and you didn’t talk to me for a month over that and I didn’t blame you because you’ve been more of a brother to me than he’s ever been. Truman is slowly coming around - Marlon’s speech from the heart soothing away his pain.
53) 9) dialog: I know things haven't worked out for either of us like we used to sit up on Monroe Avenue all night and dream they would. We all let opportunities pass us by. None of us asks for the dance as often as we should. I know that feeling when it’s like everything's slipping away and you don’t want to believe it so you look for answers someplace else. But, well, the point is, I would gladly step in front of traffic for you. 98 99
55) 1) dialog: (staring into Truman’s eyes) And the last thing I’d ever do is lie to you. (pause) Think about it, Truman, if everybody’s in on it, I’d have to be in on it too. I’m not in on it, because there is no it.
55) 3) dialog: (meeting his gaze) Not the whole thing, Truman. You were right about one thing.

We slowly pull back to reveal SIMEON and the other VIDEO OPERATORS sitting at the mixing desks arranged in tiers reminiscent of an auditorium or NASA's Mission Control. Each mixing desk contains a dozen-or-so built-in monitors and is designated with a location such as “Truman's House - Interior", "Truman's Office - Cubicle", "Tyrone's Deli" The operator at each desk, sitting in a swivel chair and wearing the slimmest of heatsets, is responsible for monitoring a particular location. The monitors cover virtually every facet of Truman's life Camera angles from the interior of Truman’s house, his backyard, car, office, the deli he frequents, the seashor to which he is drawn, the unfinished bridge where he golf with Marlon - many of the locations strangely devoid of people. Simeon, seated in the front row of mixing desks, stares b at Truman's image on the monitor, slightly unnerved.

They take their places aroun long, oval table for a story conference - Vivian sitting slightly apart from the rest of the cast. We glimpse over Christof’s shoulder at what he sees - the town of Seahaven far below, bathed in moonlight. He comes out of his reverie and joins his cast, sitting at the hea the table. In front of him, a TV "tablet" plays silently showing Truman drinking a glass of milk in his kitchen.

NIGHT. 116 TRUMAN sleeps on a cot bed in his basement - more clutter than usual. A virtual bombsite - dozens of cardboard boxe stacked everywhere.

The top of the closet has been removed and a crude tunnel containing a ladder heads almost directly upwards to the outside of the house. The bottom of the closet is ankle d with dirt. Embedded in the tunnel wall-is Meryl's Chef's Mate - Truman's digging implement. EXT. TRUMAN'S HOUSE. NIGHT. 124a MARLON's head pops up outside the house.
