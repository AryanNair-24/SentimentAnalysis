Loners watching a dog attacking a seal in the middle of t woods, a loner fighting with another loner, a loner lying dead, loners washing themselves in the river, Loner Leade feeding the pig. FEMALE V.O. We've developed a code so that we can communicate with each other, even in front of the others, without them knowing what we are saying. A handstand means “I miss you so much”. When we turn our heads to the left it means “I love you more than anything in the world” and when we turn our heads to the right it means “Watch out, we're in danger.” We had to be very careful in the beginning not to mix up “I love you more than anything in the world” with “Watch out, we're in danger.” When we raise our left arm it means “I want to dance in your arms”. When we make a fist and put it behind our backs it means “Let’s fuck, I’m horny”. The code grew more and more as time went by and within a few weeks we could talk about almost anything without even opening our mouths. About history, music, our childhood, everything. INT.

97) 11) dialog: Don’t be afraid. No-one will suspect a thing. I bet you weren’t expecting this surprise. Isn’t it wonderful?
97) 13) dialog: What’s there to think about? If it’s better to see clearly or to be shortsighted, is that it? That’s absurd, you know that. Anyway, this doctor is the best there is, it’s really very difficult to get an appointment. I called him months ago to get him to see you today. A SECRETARY goes up to them and shows them the door to th doctor’s office. 103 104 105 106 72. INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - MORNING The DOCTOR sits behind his desk.

100) 1) dialog: Throw down your knife and stand up.
100) 3) dialog: You're being completely irrational. I understand you’re upset by the unexpected results but to accuse me is very insulting to say the least. The doctor said there were some unforeseen complications after your surgery. That is all. Who would have guessed such a simple procedure could have such catastrophic results? No one. Anyway, what reason could I possibly have had to do such a hideous thing on purpose?
100) 5) dialog: I have no idea what you’re talking about. The drugs are messing with your head. If I were you, I’d try and be a little braver about the whole thing. Now get up and give me the knife, or I’1l hit you and take it by force. Shortsighted Woman says nothing. She’s still holding the knife in a threatening manner. LONER LEADER (CONT’D) Here I come. Loner Leader signals to Loner Narrator, who goes over to Shortsighted Woman. She grabs the hand holding the knife they begin to fight. Loner Leader speaks close to Loner Narrator’s head, so that the Shortsighted Woman, who is n blind, thinks she’s wrestling with Loner Leader.

Just think [groans] that when someone [groans] goes blind, one of their other senses [groans] is heightened. Touch, hearing, smell [groans]. You’1ll smell better, hear better. You’1ll feel things with your fingers and know what it is you’re touching [groans]. Silence. Loner Narrator has been dead some time now. Shortsighted Woman raises herself up a little. She feels the dead woman’s body with her hands and takes her pulse. puts down the bloody knife, wipes her hands and gets up. is when Loner Leader begins her monologue again. Shortsig Woman jumps in fear. LONER LEADER (CONT’D) You could also catch a dog in the woods and train it to guide you. Dogs can do that, you know. I’1l help you catch a dog myself. Now that I think of it, your sense of touch may already be heightened. Let’s find out right now. I’1l put something in your hand and you tell me what it is. Okay? Loner Leader gives her something and closes her hand arou it tight. LONER LEADER (CONT’D) Make a fist. Feel what it is, feel its shape. It’s not difficult. Shortsighted Woman falls down and screams. Loner Leader continues to squeeze her fist. LONER LEADER (CONT’D) What is it? What is it? I’1ll give you a little more time to guess but I can’t wait much longer. What is it? Shortsighted Woman screams. Loner Leader lets go of her h She opens her fist and her palm is covered blood. LONER LEADER (CONT’D) Time’s up. It’s a small razor blade. (MORE )
100) 8) text: LONER LEADER (CONT’D) It seems your sense of touch hasn’t improved yet but it’1ll happen, you'll see. Now get up. If you carry on acting like this I’m going to leave you here and I don’t think you'll manage to find meeting point two on your own.

103) 5) dialog: Shortsighted Woman had an operation and went blind. It’s so very sad. And then my deputy leader was killed on our way back. She was attacked by a jaguar. I’m really very upset because I was thinking of making Shortsighted Woman deputy leader as she’s very capable and loyal. But then I gave it some thought and realised that now it will be difficult for her to command so many people. The next person I thought could take on such a responsibility is you. 78.
103) 7) dialog: Don’t thank me. I trust you completely and I consider you one of the best loners I’ve seen in years. I know you won't disappoint me in any way. If something happens to me, you will take over. Take a few days to think about it and let me know when you’re ready. Here’s the place with the truffles. You can’t imagine how many there are. I wanted you to come with me and see it for yourself. If you become deputy leader, you’ll need to know where in the woods you can find lots of truffles.

108) 1) dialog: How do you like this place here?
108) 3) dialog: It is nice, and more importantly very quiet because of the rocks you have to climb to get here. Can you imagine why I brought you to such a quiet place today?
108) 5) dialog: Because I think it’s the perfect spot for your grave. It was my second choice for my own grave, but in the end I decided on a place a little to the north of here because there are fewer dogs around there, digging all the time for bones. She takes a small pickaxe from her pocket and gives it to him. David starts to dig. After a while he gets tired and stops. He’s only managed to dig a small hole. He climbs i it but his whole body won’t fit. He tries to fit as best can. LONER LEADER (CONT’D) You have to make it bigger so you'll fit better. As I said, there are a lot of dogs around here. Now cover yourself with soil. Use your hands. He scoops some soil onto his body and sits there a little motionless. LONER LEADER (CONT’D) Over your face too. You wouldn’t want your face to get eaten, would you? David puts more soil over his face and body. He seems terrified. LONER LEADER (CONT’D) Can you see how great this spot is? 82.
