The HOTEL MANAGER her HUSBAND enter. The Waiter and the Maid who were handi out shoes to the new guests follow them in. The Hotel Man is a woman of around 55. She is dressed formally and her is carefully styled. Almost like a sculpture.
13) 1) dialog: Welcome. I am the Hotel Manager and this gentleman is my partner. You’re one of the lucky ones because your room is one of our superior rooms. That means it has a view. The Hotel Manager sits on the only chair and her partner stands beside her. They resemble the paintings on the lob wall, only in reverse. HOTEL MANAGER (CONT’D) Did you read the leaflet? 12.
13) 3) dialog: Very good. The fact that you'll turn into an animal if you don't manage to fall in love with another person during your stay here is not something that should upset you, or get you down. Just think, as an animal you'll have a second chance to find a companion. But even then you must be very careful. You'll need to find a companion who is the same type of animal as you are. A wolf and a penguin could never live together, nor could a camel with a hippopotamus. That would be absurd. Think about it. But there are certain combinations in particular that are worst of all - for example a bear with a fish, or a lion with an antelope, or a fox with a chicken. I realise that this discussion is a little unpleasant for you but I have a duty to prepare you psychologically for every possible outcome. Have you decided what animal you would like to be if you end up alone?

The take David's arm, twist it behind his back and bring out special leather accessory consisting of a belt and a brac linked together. They fasten the belt around his waist an the bracelet around his wrist, so that his hand is held t behind his back and he cannot move his arm. The belt buck in front is then locked with a small key, so that he cann take it off. HOTEL MANAGER (CONT’D) This is so you see how easy life is when there are two of something instead of just one. We forget this from time to time. The handcuff will be removed at the same time tomorrow. But that’s enough for today. I imagine it was a trying day. Good evening and enjoy your stay. They leave and close the door behind them. David looks do at the belt and bracelet.

44) 3) dialog: What I always say in these situations is that it would be wise to choose something you cannot do as an animal, like read a work of classic literature or sing a song you really like. It would be silly if you chose, for example, a walk in the grounds or to have sexual intercourse with someone because these are things you can also do as an animal. But first, your best friend would like to read something she wrote for you that is really very touching. Nosebleed Woman unfolds a sheet of paper.
