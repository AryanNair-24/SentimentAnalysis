FEMALE V.O. We've developed a code so that we can communicate with each other, even in front of the others, without them knowing what we are saying. A handstand means “I miss you so much”. When we turn our heads to the left it means “I love you more than anything in the world” and when we turn our heads to the right it means “Watch out, we're in danger.” We had to be very careful in the beginning not to mix up “I love you more than anything in the world” with “Watch out, we're in danger.” When we raise our left arm it means “I want to dance in your arms”. When we make a fist and put it behind our backs it means “Let’s fuck, I’m horny”. The code grew more and more as time went by and within a few weeks we could talk about almost anything without even opening our mouths. About history, music, our childhood, everything. INT.
