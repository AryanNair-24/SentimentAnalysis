3) 5) dialog: There's this white guy I was in the joint with. Aryan Brotherhood. We did some business, now we're both out. And he still owes me. (MORE)

3) 11) dialog: Only who he works for. He's a bodyguard for a builder named Wolfmann. MOMENT. Doc writes: paranoia alert.
3) 13) dialog: Sledge Poteet.
3) 15) dialog: Said you helped him out of a situation back in '67.
3) 17) dialog: That's right -- they were teachin' us both how to cook.

3) 23) dialog: Black Guerrilla Family.
3) 25) dialog: We found we shared many of the same opinions about the U.S. government.
3) 27) dialog: My old street gang. Artesia Crips. When I got out of Chino I went looking for some of them and found it ain't just them gone, but the whole turf itself.
3) 29) dialog: Not there. Grind up in little pieces. Seagulls all pickin' at it. Figure I must be trippin', drive around for a while, come back, everything's still gone.

3) 33) dialog: That's it.
3) 36) dialog: How long you been doin' this?

3) 52) dialog: I counted.
10) 16) dialog: I didn't do it.
10) 18) dialog: If Glen was a target, then I am, too. Better not be in contact, man. This is not some bunch of fools like the LAPD. And if you don't mind a piece of free advice - - forget it all. Dial tone...
41) 9) dialog: Hey, Doctor Sportello, my man. This is all right, isn't it? DOC closes the door, and looks at Petunia:
