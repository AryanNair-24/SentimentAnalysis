64) 22) dialog: What kind of girl do you need, Doc? Maybe a thing for those Manson chicks?
64) 24) dialog: Submissive, brainwashed, horny little teeners who do exactly what you want before you even know what that is. You don't even have to say a word out loud, they get it all by ESP. Your kind of chick, Doc?
64) 26) dialog: Now, what would Charlie do?
64) 29) dialog: Mickey... Mickey could have taught all you swinging beach bums a thing or two. He was just so powerful. Sometimes he could almost make you feel invisible.

64) 31) dialog: It's so nice to be made to feel invisible that way sometimes...
64) 33) dialog: He'd bring me to lunch in Beverly Hills, one big hand all the way around my bare arm, steering me blind down out of those bright streets into some space where it was dark and cool and you couldn't smell any food, only alcohol -- they'd all be drinking, tables full of them, in a room that could have been any size, and they all knew Mickey, they wanted, some of them, to be Mickey... He might as well have been bringing me in on a leash. He kept me in those micro minidresses, never allowed me to wear anything underneath... just offering me to whoever wanted to stare. Or grab. Or sometimes he'd fix me up with his friends. And I'd have to do whatever they wanted...
64) 35) dialog: Oh, I'm sorry, Doc. Do you want me to stop? If my girlfriend had run away to be the bought-and-sold whore of some scumbag developer? I'd just be so angry I don't know what I'd do. Well, no, I'm even lying about that, I know what I'd do. If I had the faithless little bitch over my lap like this -- And they're fucking.

64) 53) dialog: We were neighbors in Hancock Park.
64) 55) dialog: I saw him on a ‘Brady Bunch’ episode once. We walked our dogs at the same time each morning...
64) 57) dialog: Which one what?
64) 59) dialog: Jan gets a wig. Gets tired of being a blonde.
64) 61) dialog: I told him I had a friend who needed to kick drugs -- and he told me he knew a program that really worked... and then Coy just disappeared.

64) 69) dialog: ...but there was no reason for me to waste a minute on a sick junkie like Coy... he wasn't my charity project and if you stop to think about some of the girls you've hung out with...
64) 71) dialog: I should be saying ‘Coy's a big boy and he can take care of himself,’ but the only thing is I don't think he can...
64) 73) dialog: «+. what do you think was gonna happen when you got into your whole P.I. trip?
64) 75) dialog: Oh? Far as I can see, you and Coy, you're peas in a pod.

79) 7) dialog: She knows things, Doc... maybe about us that we don't know...
79) 9) dialog: Course not. She drifts -- off to sleep.
