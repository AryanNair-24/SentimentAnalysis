29) 24) dialog: Clancy Charlock.
29) 28) dialog: Glen was a shit and bound to have 58. his series canceled sometime. But that don’t keep me from wanting to know who his killer is.
29) 30) dialog: They talked to me. Some smart-ass named Bjornsen. Can’t say it was encouraging. But I guess he’s a fan of yours... Would you mind not staring at my tits like that?
29) 32) dialog: He sounded a lot more concerned with Mickey Wolfmann's disappearance than Glen's murder, which I guess is no big surprise. Is that a joint? Can I smoke it? DOC pulls out a freshly rolled one.
29) 35) dialog: Way too sentimental.
29) 37) dialog: That's how Boris has it figured to. one suck 59.

29) 41) dialog: He said Mickey was in the deepest shit you could get in all because of this idea that came to him.
29) 43) dialog: All the money he ever made -- he was working on a way just to give it back.
29) 45) dialog: That's what I said!
29) 47) dialog: Wouldn't be the first rich guy on a guilt trip lately. He was doing a lot of acid and peyote and maybe it just got to a point... you must've seen that happen.

29) 51) dialog: Boris heard him say it... he wanted to build a big place out in the desert where anybody could come and live for free -- called Arrepentimiento.
29) 53) dialog: Spanish for ‘sorry about that.’ The idea was if there was an open unit -- it was yours for free... anyone from anywhere can have shelter... are you gonna keep holding on to that joint or are you gonna marry it?
29) 55) dialog: Only one I've heard Boris say anything about is Shasta -- the one's gone missing.
29) 57) dialog: Said Shasta was the only one that ever made any sense around there -- she was nervous about Mickey givin' away all his money -- which I guess caused some problems because it made him think that's all she was worried about was her meal ticket -- which I guess was really crazy cause she was in love with him. Deeply in love...
