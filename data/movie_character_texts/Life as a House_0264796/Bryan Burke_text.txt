27) 3) text: He holds out the wad of wet paper towels, but before he c say trashcan, BRYAN BURKE stands up from behind his desk.
27) 4) dialog: George, have a seat!  I've got juice.

28) 2) text: Bryan grabs a trashcan and holds it up; George tosses the ball into the trash and sits down.
28) 3) dialog: Orange juice...croissant?
28) 4) text: Bryan motions with his hand as he sits.
28) 6) dialog: What are you on?
28) 8) dialog: how much weight have you lost?
28) 10) dialog: How's your wife?
28) 12) text: Bryan nods and laughs as he takes a chunk of croissant an chews as he talks.
28) 13) dialog: Right...she married...what was he?
28) 15) dialog: Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
28) 17) dialog: Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
28) 18) text: Bryan is anxious as he holds up the rest of the croissant George shakes his head "no".  Bryan tosses his croissant the trash can and leans forward.
28) 19) dialog: This isn't me. (beat) We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
28) 21) dialog: All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
28) 23) dialog: Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
28) 26) dialog: Maybe that's too long.
28) 28) dialog: That's too long.
28) 29) text: George nods as he stares at Bryan.
28) 30) dialog: Listen, they decided on a week a year severance, but I got them to twenty-six.  That's six months salary, George.  Medical and everything for six months.  You can learn all you need to on the computer long before that.  Maybe find a job closer to home.
28) 31) text: Bryan is rattled by George's blank stare.  He takes his g of orange juice and sits back in his chair, taking a sip, the while keeping an eye on George.
28) 33) text: Bryan knows he's supposed to say something, he just can't seem to figure out what.
28) 34) dialog: Oh.
28) 36) dialog: Forty.
28) 38) text: Bryan lights up at the sound of his Alma matter.
28) 39) dialog: Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
28) 41) text: This is not the direction Bryan had hoped the conversatio was headed.
28) 43) text: Bryan wants this to end.  He leans forward with a whisper
28) 44) dialog: Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
28) 46) dialog: What are you talking about?  You love your job.
28) 48) text: Bryan is perplexed as George stands.
28) 49) dialog: Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
28) 51) dialog: I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
28) 53) dialog: Well, I feel better about this now.
28) 55) text: Relieved and not understanding anything about irony, Brya stands and extends his hand.  George shakes Bryan's hand without malice.
28) 57) dialog: What can I do for you, George?
28) 59) text: Bryan recoils slightly from the request.
28) 60) dialog: Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best.  Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me.  I would miss that too much. (beat) Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you.  Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
28) 62) dialog: Well, it's the least I can do.
28) 64) text: George nods and leaves.  Bryan looks lost and guilty agai
29) 4) text: The plea is instantly followed by a pathetic low whine.  George works up a sweat as he whacks model after model; portions of plastic walls or window splatter the office a though bombed in war.  Bryan Burke's secretary inches as close as she dares.
29) 10) text: With that, George finishes what he began only minutes pri the complete and utter destruction of every model display on every shelf in the office, save one.  Workers huddle together, collectively moaning and moving en mass from th mayhem.  George picks up the sole surviving model in his and cradles it carefully as he walks into Bryan Burke's office.
30) 0) text: Bryan cowers behind his desk as George enters with his mo in one hand and the long wooden stick in the other.
30) 2) text: It takes Bryan a few aborted attempts to answer before he simply nods.
30) 4) text: Bryan nods again, then quivers as George steps forward, l the stick against the desk and extends his hand.
30) 6) text: Bryan winces as he extends his hand.  They shake hands an George grabs hold of the stick again.
30) 7) dialog: Thank you.
30) 8) text: George walks around the desk and bashes in a model hidden the floor, one that Bryan had obviously wanted to save.
30) 9) dialog: Oh, fuck!
30) 10) text: George drops the wooden spool and walks out of the office Bryan garners the courage to stand.
30) 11) dialog: You're not even an architect and you're a miserable human being.
30) 14) text: George closes the door behind him.  Bryan stares down at remains of the model; he gets down on his knees and caref gathers up the pieces.
