I had a dream where he came to me and brought me a little gift - earrings they were - and we made love. perhaps it is just as well I accept Hemingway's offer to go to Africa. Life with Pablo is too full of conflict and I am suffocating under his genius. Why I need to go from one brilliant man to another is my weakness. Gil is different, perhaps not a genius but not moody and selfish like Pablo or Amedeo was. I think a trip to Africa with Hemingway would help get these feelings for Gil off my mind.

Maybe it comes in a blue velvet box and he finds some col paper. Gil writes card: To Adriana with love. He crosses it out - To Adriana avec amour. He gives a final check to himself and opens door to leave running smack into Inez and both her parents, home from t trip prematurely.
