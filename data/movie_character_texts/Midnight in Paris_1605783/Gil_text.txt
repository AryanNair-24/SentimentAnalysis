0) 1) dialog: This is unbelievable - look at this. There's no city like this in the world. There never was.
0) 3) dialog: Well that's just the awful era we live in but can you just imagine what this was like before - but even with all the fast food joints and the traffic - god, you just can't imagine what it was like years ago.
0) 5) dialog: I really do - I love cities - I love big cities with all the crowds and all the action. (Having seen a panoramic view of let us say the Champs El we embark on a montage of the city. The comments offered above and following are an approximation of what the acto feel.)
1) 1) dialog: Look at these places - the streets - the boulevards.
1) 4) dialog: I don't get here often enough is the problem. Every once in a while for a few days is nothing - my biggest regret is that I didn't settle here the first time I came. I should have gone with my instincts.
1) 6) dialog: If I'd have stayed the first time I came by now I'd be a Parisian.
2) 1) dialog: I'm thinking of a painting by Pisarro I've seen of Paris in the rain. Can you picture how drop dead gorgeous this city is in the rain? Imagine this town in the twenties - Paris in the twenties - in the rain - the artists and writers - I was born too late. Why did God deliver me into the world in the 1970's and in Pasadena yet.
2) 3) dialog: It's romantic.
2) 6) dialog: Or Paris when it's just getting dark - the lights go on - or at night - it's great at night - or no, sunset on the Champs Elysees -
2) 7) dialog: Could you ever think of us moving here after we're married?
3) 2) dialog: Like?
3) 4) dialog: Hawaii is America.
3) 6) dialog: If I had stayed here and written novels and not gotten into grinding out movie scripts.
3) 8) dialog: But this is where all the artists came to live, to work - the writers, the painters.
3) 11) dialog: Boy, I'd drop the house in Beverly Hills, the pool, everything - in a heartbeat. Look - this is where Monet lived and painted - we're thirty minutes from town. Imagine the two of us settling here. If my book turns out we could do it - you could just as easily make jewelry here.
4) 2) dialog: I'm in love with you. (kiss)
4) 7) dialog: What a town.
4) 9) dialog: I could easily see myself as a Parisien - strolling the Left Bank - a baguette under my arm - finishing my novel - at a table at the Cafe Flore. A Moveable Feast - Hemingway called it.
4) 12) dialog: Well yes it was different then.
4) 14) dialog: Americans eat dinner so early.
5) 6) dialog: (amiably)
5) 10) dialog: There's nothing wrong with your father and I disagreeing. That's what democracy is. Your father defends the right wing of the Republican party and I happen to think they represent sub-mental Neanderthals. But we respect each other's views - am I right? (this last directed at John gets no enthusiasm but a cold look from him)
5) 13) dialog: Just no Wagner. When she walks down the aisle not The Ride of the Valkyries. Hey look, I just want to say that I am politically bipartisan in that, in my view, to be a politician of any party one must of necessity be a whore.
5) 17) text: Paul and Carol Bates - Mom, Dad, you know Gil - you didn't mention you'd be here.
5) 22) dialog: Don't we have a lot of commitments?
5) 26) dialog: Don't we have something tomorrow? We were going to have lunch at the Brasserie Lipp. My old professor once actually saw James Joyce there. He said Joyce was eating sauerkraut and frankfurters. (silent pause)
5) 28) dialog: It is actually -
5) 30) dialog: Yes - but -
6) 3) dialog: How was I anti-social?
6) 5) dialog: Well they're your friends and I can't say I'm as taken with him as you are.
6) 7) dialog: I find him a pseudo-intellectual.
6) 9) dialog: I'm having trouble because I'm a Hollywood hack who never gave actual literature a real shot.
6) 11) text: Gil, promise me if this book doesn't come off you'll give up beating your brains out and get back to what you do best.
8) 5) dialog: I keep trying to talk her into a little attic with a skylight in Paris -
8) 11) dialog: Yes movie scripts are easier.

10) 24) dialog: I did - no question.    Camille- Rose.
10) 28) dialog: Me? Why would I read a biography of Rodin?
11) 8) dialog: To me they're all great.   What the hell do I know?
11) 10) dialog: Pheromones, it's your pheromones. Paul and Carol have ambled over, having heard Gil's last amorous remark.
11) 14) dialog: You will admit she's a sexy woman.
11) 18) dialog: (a bit high) To the little green Heinz pickle pin.
12) 3) dialog: I don't want to be a party pooper but I just want fresh air.
12) 6) dialog: If it's okay with you, I'd really just like a little walk and go to bed. We can do it another night.
12) 8) dialog: You go?

20) 66) dialog: It's only about four hundred pages - if you could just give me your opinion.
20) 68) dialog: You do?

30) 9) dialog: If I'm not mistaken this was a failed attempt to capture a young French girl named Adriana - from Bordeaux - if my art history serves me - came to Paris to study costume design for the theatre. Believe she had a brief affair with Modigliani - then Braque - that's where Pablo met her - er Picasso. You'd never know it from this portrait but she's quite subtly beautiful.
30) 11) dialog: And I'd hardly call the picture superb. It's more of a petit bourgeoise statement of how Pablo er Picasso sees her, saw her - he's distracted by the fact she was a volcano in the sack.

33) 7) dialog: That's putting it mildly.
33) 11) dialog: There's no book or painting, or symphony or sculpture that can rival a great city. All these streets and boulevards as a special art form.

36) 26) dialog: Look, you're sur-realists - but I'm a normal guy - See, in one life I'm engaged to marry a woman I love - at least I think I love her. Christ, I'm supposed to love her if I'm marrying her.
36) 31) dialog: In a dream - which is fine for you because you guys dabble in dreams.
36) 33) dialog: Adriana is her name. And I felt drawn to her - but it wouldn't matter - men much greater than me, profound artists - she's drawn to geniuses - and they to her.
36) 35) dialog: Of course my biggest problem is reality. BuNuEL Reality is nothing more than a dream - we all exist in the dream of a dog.
36) 36) dialog: I was born in the wrong time.
36) 39) dialog: I see an insurmountable problem.
37) 2) dialog: Er - some - yes - I'm beginning to think my book may be too realistic - that I've missed some chances to let my imagination run wild and not be so damn logical В·В·В·

38) 7) dialog: God it's so French. Er - you remember me?
38) 9) dialog: Yeah, pedantic - perfect word. You're very observant. I need some advice. I'd like a woman's take. A French woman - an observant French woman. I met some woman that I very quickly became smitten with. Smitten?
38) 11) dialog: I'm engaged to be married. I know Rodin had a wife and a mistress but I'm American - we can't handle that - we're monogamous.
38) 13) dialog: Yes. Her name's Adriana. Right now she's living with Picas-- with a Spaniard - er he paints - fairly well. В·В·
38) 16) dialog: Love him or me? Well I hardly think, me. But we've just met. See, another very gifted man flirts with her, a writer. All these geniuses fall in love with her. And what am I? And then of course there's another big problem. I can't exactly explain.
38) 18) dialog: I don't know whether to call it an age difference - or a problem of geography - I'm so messed up. I'm not Hemingway, I'm not Picasso, I'm not Rodin. I'm just a guy who was born too late.

45) 10) text: I am in love with an American writer I just met named Gil Pender. His eyes widen.
45) 12) text: That immediate magic one hears about happened to me. I know that both Picasso and Hemingway are in love with me but for whatever inexplicable reasons the heart has, I am drawn to Gil. Perhaps because he seems naive and unassuming.
45) 14) text: As always in this sad life he is about to marry a woman named Inez. I had a dream where he came to me and brought me a little gift - earrings they were - and we made love. perhaps it is just as well I accept Hemingway's offer to go to Africa. Life with Pablo is too full of conflict and I am suffocating under his genius. Why I need to go from one brilliant man to another is my weakness. Gil is different, perhaps not a genius but not moody and selfish like Pablo or Amedeo was. I think a trip to Africa with Hemingway would help get these feelings for Gil off my mind.
45) 18) dialog: It's a little complicated to explain. Thanks for translating -

46) 2) text: He goes to Inez's jewelry box and picks out art nouveau earrings he knows Adriana would like. He grabs a box and gift wraps it quickly. Maybe it comes in a blue velvet box and he finds some col paper. Gil writes card: To Adriana with love. He crosses it out - To Adriana avec amour. He gives a final check to himself and opens door to leave running smack into Inez and both her parents, home from t trip prematurely.

46) 75) dialog: Maybe you thought you put them away and left them out or dropped them, and the maid found them and left them out where you could see them easily.
46) 77) dialog: The main thing is they're not stolen.
46) 82) text: Gil is disappointed.

48) 11) dialog: Oh er - I brought a rewrite of the first few chapters of my book and was hoping you would tell me if you thought I was on the right track.
48) 13) dialog: Er - have you heard from Hemingway?
48) 15) dialog: By herself?
49) 0) text: 64 Wedding in progress.    Informal, non-traditional wedding artist type guests. Gil finds Adriana.
49) 2) dialog: I came to find you.
49) 5) dialog: Let's just say as a writer I see into women's souls and I sense that you have very complicated feelings towards me.
49) 7) dialog: I'm not so sure about anything anymore - can we just go where it's quiet? They are almost out the door when they run into Luis Bufi
49) 8) dialog: Oh, Mr. Bufiuel, I had a nice idea for a movie for you. BuNuEL
49) 10) dialog: A group of people are at a formal dinner party and after dinner when they try to leave the room, they can't. BuNuEL
49) 12) dialog: They just can't seem to exit the door. BuNuEL
49) 14) dialog: And because they're all forced to stay together the veneer of civilization quickly comes off them and they behave as who they really are - animals. BuNuEL
49) 17) dialog: Just think about it - that's all I'm saying - maybe one day you'll be shaving and it'll tickle your fancy.
50) 0) text: 65 Gil and Adriana at romantic locale.     He kisses her.
50) 2) dialog: I don't know but I do know that for a brief moment, when I was doing it, I felt - immortal.
50) 4) dialog: Because life is too mysterious for me.
50) 6) dialog: I've always been a logical person. I never took chances - did anything crazy - like move here when I first came or take a shot at being a real writer, not a Hollywood hired hand - but I feel like letting everything go.
50) 7) text: Gil gives her earrings. CaNTO: 65
50) 8) dialog: Here.

53) 0) text: 68 Gil and Adriana are dancing romantically.
53) 2) dialog: The present - Yes, the present always seems worse than the past but it can't be - to always think this generation is stupider and coarser than the last - and yet - here we are at Maxims tonight and yes, it's fabulous.
55) 0) text: 70 Gil and Adriana sit and hold hands.   Dance ends and girl off.
55) 4) text: Encore du vin. Le meme chose. (to Gil)

55) 14) dialog: This much French I know.
55) 16) dialog: I'm American. Oui -
55) 20) dialog: Yes, I love your pictures too.
55) 24) dialog: Parlez Anglais?
55) 36) dialog: Er - yes - Monsieur Lauren - Ralph. (to Gauguin) Shouldn't you be in Tahiti?
55) 45) dialog: I wouldn't get into too many details with them. Let's just leave it that we're temporarily passing through.
55) 47) dialog: What are you talking about?
55) 49) dialog: But I love the Jazz Age.
55) 51) dialog: But what happened to the twenties and the Charleston and Cole Porter?
55) 55) dialog: It's not the present for me - I'm from 2010.
55) 57) dialog: I dropped in on you just the way we dropped in on the 1890's.
55) 59) dialog: I wanted to escape my present just like you wanted to escape yours. To a golden age.
55) 61) dialog: To me they are.
55) 63) dialog: Yes but don't you see - to these guys the golden age was the Renaissance. They'd all trade the Belle Epoque to paint alongside Michelangelo or Titian. And those guys probably imagine life was better when Kubla Khan was around. I'm having an insight. A minor one but that accounts for the anxiety of my dream.
55) 65) dialog: Last night I dreamed I ran out of zithromax - and then I went to the dentist and there was no novacaine - these people have no antibiotics -
55) 69) dialog: And even in the twenties - no dishwashers - no 911 if your appendix bursts - no "movies on demand" В·
55) 71) dialog: Because if you stay here and this becomes your present, sooner or later you'll imagine another time was really the golden time. And so will I - I'm beginning to see why it can't work, Adriana. The present has a hold on you because it's your present and while there's never any progress in the most important things, you get to appreciate - what little progress is made - the internet - Pepto- Bismol. The present is always going to seem unsatisfying because life itself is unsatisfying - that's why Gauguin goes back and forth between Paris and Tahiti, searching - it's my job as a writer to try and come up with reasons why despite life being tragic and unsatisfying, it's still worth it.
55) 73) dialog: Yes, that one I regretted but it was a real choice and I made the wrong one. This is a choice between accepting reality or surreal insanity.
55) 76) dialog: No - I love you - but this way lies madness - and if I'm ever going to write anything worthwhile I've got to get rid of my illusions and that I'd be happier in the past is one of them.
55) 78) dialog: Goodbye Adriana.     Good luck.
55) 83) dialog: (taking it back) Thank you. I can't tell you how much this means to me.
55) 85) dialog: Hemingway read it?    What was his suggestion?
55) 88) dialog: with -
55) 90) dialog: It's called denial. Thanks again. (to passing poet)
56) 0) text: 72 Gil back in present in mid-argument with Inez.
56) 2) dialog: From Ernest Hemingway. He thought it out and it makes perfect sense.
56) 4) dialog: There's nothing crazy about Ernest Hemingway or Gertrude Stein or Fitzgerald or Salvador Dali -
56) 6) dialog: It was William Faulkner who said, the past is not dead.
56) 11) dialog: I guess I'm too trusting. I'm jealous and also trusting - cognitive dissonance, Scott Fitzgerald speaks of it.
56) 13) dialog: I know it Inez - you can fool me but not Hemingway.
56) 15) dialog: I'm not going back.
56) 17) dialog: I'm staying here. It's not the romantic fling. Paris is Paris. It's that I'm not in love with you.
56) 19) dialog: A lot has happened    to me since we got here. I won't     begin to bore you - but - I know    what that feeling of love is    and it's not us.
56) 22) dialog: I was attracted to another woman but it was the whole deal - meeting Gertrude Stein and Hemingway and Dali and Scott and Zelda -
56) 26) dialog: If I'm not happy I'll move back. But right now I'm going to stay.
56) 30) dialog: You're better off without me.
56) 33) dialog: Goodbye Inez.

58) 3) dialog: What are you doing here?
58) 5) dialog: What's your name?
58) 7) dialog: Gabrielle, - I'm Gil - I just moved to Paris this week.
58) 9) dialog: Can I walk along with you or can I buy you a coffee? Oh god, it's starting to rain.
58) 11) dialog: Oh what a thing to say.     I couldn't agree more.
58) 13) dialog: Hey what are those bells?
58) 17) dialog: Midnight - right - right - pretty name. FADE OUT as they walk off together in the rain.
