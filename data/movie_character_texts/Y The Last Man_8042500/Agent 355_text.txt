4) 14) dialog: The President is a bitch. INT. DOLL FACTORY —- MORNING It’s after hours inside a dimly lit DOLL FACTORY that’s cluttered with unassembled plastic body parts of girls’ t Standing under a naked bulb in this warehouse-sized room AGENT 355, a late-twenties African-American woman who cou kill you with a single dreadlock.
4) 15) dialog: If you want him dead, I’m your man. Pull out, as we reveal that Agent 355 is speaking with tw men, a seated RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN and the nervous ASSISTA standing behind him.
4) 18) dialog: Haven’t you heard? We’re the deadlier of the species. If Mother Russia could hold onto her brides better, maybe you wouldn’t have to outsource all your dirty work. The frowning Russian businessman just stares at 355... bu his grimace eventually gives way to a smile.
4) 20) dialog: Messy divorce?
4) 22) dialog: (ignoring this) Give me the first ten million now, and POTUS will be dead before he leaves his stupid ranch. The businessman motions to his assistant, who brings 355 SUITCASE. Just as he’s about to hand over this case, 355 GRABS the assistant’s wrist and TWISTS it behind his back With her free hand, 355 pulls out a GLOCK, which she pres to her startled hostage’s head.
4) 25) dialog: You're not really in a position to be asking questions, fuckface. The businessman calmly raises a finger, and GUNSHOTS ring as the hostage’s chest suddenly EXPLODES. The dead assist slumps to the ground, as SEVERAL HEAVILY ARMED RUSSIAN BRUISERS step out of the shadows behind their boss.
8) 0) text: Agent 355 is now seated in a folding chair, with her hand HANDCUFFED behind her. The bruises on her face suggest th she’s been tortured for the last few hours by the Russian mobster and his henchmen.
8) 2) dialog: I told you, I’m Agent 355.
8) 4) dialog: My colleagues will be here any second now.
14) 0) text: As one of the menacing Russian henchmen approaches the handcuffed Agent 355, she KICKS him in the knee, painfull HYPEREXTENDING the joint. He collapses, and 355 uses the momentum to FALL backwards and SLIDE free of her chair. W her hands still cuffed behind her, she WHEEL KICKS to her feet... only to find the Russian businessman with his gun pressed to her temple. 355 closes her eyes and prepares for the worst, when this suddenly begins coughing violently. She watches in disbel as he begins to VOMIT blood. The businessman drops his gun and 355’s baton to grab at own throat, as he suddenly begins to bleed out of his eye nose and ears. His henchmen soon follow suit. 355 can only watch in stunned confusion as the Russian terrorists die painful deaths, leaving her all alone in t quiet factory.
29) 32) dialog: My name’s not Catherine.
29) 34) dialog: (to Yorick) Hop on.
29) 36) dialog: I’m not an Amazon. I’m an agent of the Culper Ring. Yorick picks up his carrier to make sure that Ampersand i safe.
29) 38) dialog: Forget it. We should go before the fireworks begin.
30) 1) dialog: You ever siphoned before? 4l
30) 3) dialog: You can call me 355.
30) 5) dialog: It’s classified. Hearing that word again, Yorick suddenly grows nervous.
30) 7) dialog: We’re a hell of a lot more secret than that.
30) 9) dialog: I told you, I’m not allowed to... 355 stops herself.
30) 10) dialog: Fuck it. What’s the point, right? My bosses are all dead. Yorick actually looks a little relieved to hear this.
30) 12) dialog: 355 was the codename assigned to this country’s first female spy. She was part of General Washington’s Culper Ring during the Revolutionary War. 42
30) 14) dialog: You wouldn’t have learned this in A.P. History, but Washington never disbanded the Culper Ring. For more than 200 years, we've been secretly working to protect the men and women of this country. Yorick looks at a CORPSE inside one of the nearby vehicle
30) 16) dialog: What’s your story?
30) 18) dialog: So you have no clue why you’re the last guy?
30) 21) dialog: Well, it’s a good thing I found you when I did. You wouldn’t survive another month out there on your own. The Amazon movement is growing, and those women would love nothing more than killing someone like you. 43
30) 23) dialog: I infiltrated their organization to find out if they had anything to do with whatever caused the global Manslaughter. They’re smart enough to exploit it, but I don’t think they started it. Unfortunately for you, they do have a plan to keep humanity going. 355 jumps back on the refueled bike.
30) 24) dialog: And it’s strictly no boys allowed.
32) 2) dialog: That’s the plan. Hopefully, Dr. Mann will be able to tell us why you and your animal survived, too. Yorick grows nervous.
32) 4) dialog: Who the hell is that?
32) 6) dialog: Yorick, you have a responsibility. We can look for your girlfriend after we see if there’s anything you can do for the human race.
32) 8) dialog: Quiet. Ampersand loudly EEKS as 355 points at a grizzly sight up ahead, THREE SNARLING WOLVES gnawing on the REMAINS of a corpse. As the growling animals approach them, a frightened Yoric casually STEPS BEHIND 355. She quickly dispatches the kil wolves with a WARNING SHOT fired above their heads. A grateful Yorick suddenly looks a little more amenable t the idea of a travelling partner.
32) 10) dialog: First, I have to sell our bike. The Plague hit at rush hour out west, so the highways will be too congested with dead guys, even for a motorcycle.
32) 12) dialog: The old-fashioned way. 46 355 and Yorick finally reach a TRAIN YARD, where hundreds American women are lined up like REFUGEES, vying for a sp on board an impossibly long DIESEL TRAIN.
32) 13) dialog: Girls have been trading tampons and vibrator batteries for seats in first class, but these wheels should buy us some room in cargo. The masked Yorick stares at this overgrown train set, una to hide his boyish enthusiasm.
33) 3) dialog: Sorry I couldn’t get us booked in the Four Seasons. 47
33) 5) dialog: Why?
33) 7) dialog: Who’re you calling meek? Ignoring this, Yorick stands and looks out the car’s open door at the unlit scenery passing by.
33) 9) dialog: Electricity doesn’t come through the sockets magically, Yorick. It takes a lot of manpower... human- power to operate all of the plants and substations. Energy was a male- dominated industry, but other Culper Ring agents are out there trying to fill the void.
33) 11) dialog: Men held administrative positions, but the Culpers’ undercover agents were all women. 48
33) 13) dialog: Because men can think with their brains or with their penises, but not with both. We have better relationships with our bodies, makes us stronger in the field.
33) 15) dialog: We're not always as physically powerful, but there’s a reason the best rock climbers are women. We've got you beat in flexibility, agility, problem-solving.
33) 17) dialog: Not everything. You ever been to a nursing home? Notice how it’s ninety percent old women? Same with suicide. We might attempt it more, but you guys usually succeed.
33) 19) dialog: You’re ahead of us so far.
35) 2) dialog: Just keeping my hands busy. The train quickly picks up full speed.
35) 4) dialog: Few hours. Crew had to remove a herd of dead cows from the tracks.
35) 6) dialog: Sorry?
35) 8) dialog: Yeah, well, speaking of rotting livestock... Yorick sniffs at himself.
35) 10) dialog: You want to borrow one of mine? Say what you will about the Daughters of the Amazon, but their laundry skills are phenomenal. 52 355 takes a fresh dress shirt out of her bag.
35) 13) dialog: It’s a woman’s shirt, Yorick. Deal with it.
35) 15) dialog: Since buttons were invented? Guys used to carry swords, so the left side of his jacket had to close over the right. So he could draw without his blade getting caught in something? Yorick continues to stupidly fumble with his buttons, and comes over to help him.
35) 16) dialog: Ladies had servants who did their dressing for them, so putting buttons on the left made it easier for them.
35) 19) dialog: You hear that?
35) 21) dialog: The sound of a hundred women’s cycles syncing up.
37) 3) dialog: Depends how many of these crates have ammo in them.
37) 5) dialog: No, I’m gonna hold them for as long as I can while you make a break for the conductor. Tell her to disconnect the engine from the rest of the cars. She gives you any trouble, put that scatter gun to her head.
37) 7) dialog: This isn’t a democracy, remember? Consider it payback for all the years women weren’t allowed to vote.
39) 1) dialog: Exactly who is that thing supposed to be helping? Yorick stuffs the monkey into his backpack.
39) 11) dialog: Truer words. All of a sudden, 355 GRABS Yorick and YANKS him over the of the moving train with her! Pull way out, as the train barrels across a LARGE BRIDGE. 355 and Yorick are just tiny figures here, FALLING a hund feet before finally SPLASHING into a river far below. Victoria watches in disbelief, as Theresa and a few of he fellow Amazons join their leader atop the train.
42) 27) dialog: You all right? Sonia and Yorick quickly pull themselves apart, like two teens caught making out at Lovers Leap.
42) 30) dialog: Yorick, may I borrow you for a second?
43) 2) dialog: I don’t care. We have to get out of here.
43) 4) dialog: These people aren’t what you think, Yorick. They’re--
43) 7) dialog: Does the secret in secret agent mean anything to you?
43) 9) dialog: There’s a women's penitentiary about a mile up the road, Yorick.
43) 19) dialog: (to the women) This isn’t my jurisdiction, and we have no intention of telling anyone about your situation.
43) 21) dialog: For your sake, I hope you’re talking about my occupation and not my race.
43) 24) dialog: No, I have nothing to do with this! Like the word of God, a familiar voice booms from the hea over one of the chopper’s loudspeakers. It’s Alter.
43) 29) dialog: If it was anything good, they probably only would have brought one gunship. (to the women) Please. If you hand Yorick over to another country, you people will never know another peaceful day.
44) 1) dialog: Keep up, goddammit!
44) 3) dialog: Four gunships?! The youngest Israeli soldier looks for guidance from her older superiors.
44) 7) dialog: Let go of the gun! Please!
44) 9) dialog: You don’t have to die!
44) 11) dialog: (under her breath) Stupid... 355 stands, as the young soldier rattles her last breath. The Culper Ring agent looks over at Yorick, who promptly VOMITS all over his own shoes.
44) 12) dialog: Come on.
44) 14) dialog: Me or them. Let’s go.
44) 16) dialog: This isn’t a comic book, Yorick. They knew what they were doing when they filled their hands, and so did I. Now get in the chopper.
44) 18) dialog: If you had listened to me on the train, we wouldn’t be in this situation! Now do as I fucking say!
44) 20) dialog: That stopped being your decision the second other countries got involved. Ampersand barks in protest, but Yorick hangs his head. He done fighting. In the distance, a faraway gun battle can be heard.
47) 1) dialog: Yorick, I’m... I’m sorry about back there, okay? I never should have pointed a gun at you. 74
47) 4) dialog: I told you, the Culper Ring trained me well.
47) 6) dialog: The Ring recruited me out of a foster care facility when I was thirteen, after I put two redneck teenagers in the hospital for calling me names.
47) 8) dialog: My parents were killed I was six. Yorick suddenly looks guilty.
47) 10) dialog: Don’t be. You weren’t driving the truck that night.
47) 12) dialog: Yorick, a mentally ill person wouldn't be able to fly a medium- lift assault helicopter below radar at 250 miles per-- 75 Suddenly, the chopper DIPS uncomfortably as one of its extended range fuel tanks accidentally CLIPS a high branc
47) 13) dialog: Oops. A frightened Yorick looks down at his diaper-clad monkey, yelps.
47) 15) dialog: If you want to help, check that navigation computer and make sure we're on target for San Fran.
47) 17) dialog: A few refuelings aside, we should be able to fly a straight shot to her lab. It’s more important than ever that we find out why you’re still alive.
47) 19) dialog: Don’t worry, the trains are about as dependable as they were in pre- Mussolini Italy, remember? We’1l beat her by days. EXT. RAILROAD CROSSING —- MORNING Smash cut to this close-up of a DEAD MALE COWBOY, slumped over the wheel of his pick-up. Pull out to reveal that th unlucky corpse’s truck is parked directly in the middle o RAILROAD TRACKS. BAM! The vehicle is OBLITERATED when a familiar DIESEL TR plows right through it. 76 INT. DIESEL TRAIN ENGINE —- CONTINUING Inside the train’s engine, Victoria is reading to Theresa (the bald Amazon), while an overweight FEMALE CONDUCTOR reluctantly works the train’s throttle.
50) 2) dialog: Firefighters. Yorick is fed up.
50) 5) dialog: I’m not always going to be around to protect you, Yorick. But the S.U.V. of the sky here needs another ten to finish gassing up, so I figured I might as well teach you a little self-defense. Yorick waves her off. 79
50) 7) dialog: In what, Double Dragon?
50) 10) dialog: Which means what exactly?
50) 12) dialog: Why not just go to the gym?
50) 14) dialog: The heart?
50) 16) dialog: Great, that’1l come in handy when you're fighting food. As the helicopter continues to refuel, the two sit down o its edge and watch the fires continue to rage in the distance. Ampersand scampers over to sit on Yorick’s lap. 80
50) 18) dialog: Not for a while. My relationships always ended bad.
50) 20) dialog: Because men are all cheating bastards.
50) 22) dialog: Relax. You’ve got to be the only guy on the planet who’d end up in this position and not try to bang everything that moves.
50) 24) dialog: Beth is still out there, Yorick. You’1l find her soon and she’1l be fine.
50) 26) dialog: I don’t. I’m just saying whatever shit will get you to stop moping. A smiling Yorick sets Ampersand down and stands into spar position.
50) 28) dialog: Your funeral. The two playfully throw punches while black smoke continu to billow into the Vegas sky.
51) 7) dialog: Maybe. I’11 look around. You and your animal stay here.
51) 9) dialog: Hello? Just then, she hears something SNAP behind a door to her left. Slowly, 355 turns its knob and pushes her way inside. A small GENERATOR is whirring away quietly as it powers numerous COMPUTER TERMINALS, ELECTRON MICROSCOPES, etc.
51) 10) dialog: Dr. Mann? Dr. Allison M-- Suddenly, a figure steps out from behind the door and pre a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE millimeters away from a frozen 355's neck. It’s DR. MANN.
51) 12) dialog: I’m not here to hurt you, Doctor.
51) 14) dialog: I’m here to protect you. I’m Agent
51) 17) dialog: How the hell do you know about the Culpers? Dr. Mann takes a seat in one of her lab chairs, exhausted
51) 19) dialog: (a beat) What?
51) 21) dialog: What are you talking about?
51) 23) dialog: Doctor, look at me. I have no idea what this is all about. I’m here to protect you from... from people who want to use you.
51) 25) dialog: Which superiors? 84
51) 28) dialog: How... how do you know all this?
51) 30) dialog: His vision?
51) 32) dialog: Someone from the Culper Ring did this? That's... that’s impossible.
51) 34) dialog: What happened? 85
51) 37) dialog: But, how did it spread so quickly?
51) 39) dialog: Can it be reversed?
51) 41) dialog: But, can you bring mankind back to the planet?
51) 54) dialog: I... I dedicated my life to those men.
52) 10) dialog: How'd this “foreign agent” end up inside a monkey? 89
52) 18) dialog: How’s that possible? How is she connected with the Culper Ring?
52) 26) dialog: Doctor, can you replicate the antibodies inside Yorick and Ampersand?
52) 28) dialog: Then we have to get to Los Angeles fast, before Beth-- Suddenly, a SQUAWKING is heard coming from outside Mann's laboratory window. 355 draws her weapon.
52) 32) dialog: Don't touch it, Yorick. Just--
53) 8) dialog: Somehow, I don’t think that’s going to make the Israelis more likely to part with her.
53) 10) dialog: No. If they take you, it’s going to destabilize the entire world.
53) 12) dialog: Jesus Christ.
53) 14) dialog: We have to get out of here!
53) 17) dialog: Do you have a car?
53) 19) dialog: What does that mean?
54) 3) dialog: Mann, you drive. Yorick, get in the back and keep your head down. 355 pulls out a PUMP-ACTION MOSSBERG.
54) 4) dialog: I got shotgun.
55) 3) dialog: Don’t you experiment on animals for a living?
55) 8) dialog: Do better! If we can’t shake them by San Simeon, we'll have two sides going to war over Yorick! Suddenly realizing what she’s just said, 355 lowers her g to look down at Yorick, whose expression is equally knowi 95
58) 2) dialog: Forty percent. Ten percent. 96 Dr. Mann just sighs, as Yorick reaches back to pull up th vehicle’s CONVERTIBLE TOP.
62) 2) dialog: No, the Amazons won't risk hurting you, and the Israelis want Yorick alive. They’re not going to be shooting at us.
67) 1) dialog: All right, I’m gonna make a break around back and try to find Beth. As long as these assholes don’t run out of bullets, you two should be safe in here. 99
67) 3) dialog: Doctor, if I’m not back in five, peel the hell out of here and do what you can with Yorick.
70) 1) dialog: (under her breath) You're finally good for som-- Unfortunately, Ampersand proves to be just as useless as ever, as his noises apparently attracted the attention of THIRD GUARD, one who promptly SHOOTS 355. The bullet enters high in her left collarbone, just above heart, with enough force to KNOCK 355 backwards. Before s falls, 355 squeezes off a single round, HITTING her attac square in the eye. COLLAPSING to the ground, 355 fights to maintain consciousness, but her eyes start to roll back into her h Ampersand watches all this with seeming indifference.
75) 50) dialog: 
76) 0) text: In the opulent north wing just outside this suite, Alter continues to battle Agent 355. 355 flicks open her BATON, which she SMASHES against Alte right hand, causing her to drop her gun. Alter then ROUND HOUSES the baton away from 355. It’s strictly hand-to-hand and woman-to-woman from here u the end. 355 taunts Alter, as she deftly uses her one goo arm to violently SPAR with her opponent.
76) 2) dialog: If anyone got them killed, it’s you. Alter charges forward and digs her THUMB into 355’s bulle wound.
76) 3) dialog: 
76) 6) dialog: The... the Culper Ring. Alter smiles. 111
76) 10) dialog: (whispering) You know what the strongest muscle is? Before Alter can answer, 355 SNAPS her jaws around Alter’ throat, and BITES DOWN as hard as she can. Alter howls a hideous, gurgling scream, as 355 TEARS OFF healthy chunk of her neck. Stumbling away from her defenseless opponent, Alter press palm against her own neck to try to stem the horrible tid pouring out of her opened jugular. With her free hand, Alter reaches down to pick up the GUN knocked away earlier. She raises her shaky hand to fire a fatal round down into her opponent's face. 355 squeezes her eyes shut, bracing herself for impact... when she hears an unfamiliar SHUNK noise. The Culper Ring agent opens her eyes just in time to watc Alter fall forward, DEAD. Sticking out of her back is the pearl-handled dagger. 355 looks up to see a trembling BETH standing over the deceased soldier.
76) 12) dialog: Yorick? Is Yorick...? But before she can finish her thought, 355’s eyes fall sh Blackness.
76) 25) dialog: Never better. Change angles to reveal Agent 355, her face badly bruised her right arm in a cast. She looks like SHIT. Yorick tries to mask his revulsion.
76) 27) dialog: Don’t cry for me, gimp. This is for you. Figure you'll need it until your “strength” comes back. She gives the hand-carved walking stick to Yorick, who si up a bit in his hospital bed.
76) 30) dialog: No longer active duty. And we had her troops deported, with a little help from your mother.
77) 23) dialog: You sure you guys will be all right here on your own?
77) 25) dialog: Well, I appreciate the parting gift.
77) 27) dialog: If what you say about the Culper Ring is true, then they might be responsible for more atrocities than just this. I’m going to find out what they were and try to make up for as many as I can.
77) 29) dialog: All you have to do in life is die, right?
77) 32) dialog: Just figured you had more important things to do down there.
77) 34) dialog: I hope Beth let you down easy. at 355 in disbelief.
77) 36) dialog: From pretty much the moment you told me about her, yeah. Yorick just kicks at the dirt a bit.
77) 38) dialog: It’s never too late, Yorick. I’m sure you two will work it out.
77) 40) dialog: And going where?
77) 42) dialog: Yorick... 119
77) 44) dialog: Like what?
77) 46) dialog: Yorick, you're safest here.
77) 48) dialog: (a little disgusted) You have a way with words.
77) 50) dialog: Why not. As Ampersand scampers into the Yugo’s back seat, Yorick climbs in shotgun. 355 takes the wheel.
77) 51) dialog: Buckle up. I don’t need the last man on earth flying through my windshield.
