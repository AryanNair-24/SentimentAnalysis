5) 19) dialog: They're not doing anything until our patrol is finished. Suddenly, GUNSHOTS ring out. The reporter and his cameram flinch, but the Israeli soldiers just casually toss their cigarettes aside.
5) 21) text: My name is Colonel Tse’elon, and you will address me as such. Come, my team and I will get you to safety. The reporter subtly signals for his cameraman to keep filming, as Alter escorts the crew double-time through th dark streets.

9) 3) dialog: Thank you, Rachel. Just then, male voices (speaking Hebrew) are heard scream over Rachel’s radio. Gradually, the screaming becomes LIVE, as the male soldie surrounding them begin to scream as well.
9) 4) dialog: The hell...?
16) 2) dialog: No. This can’t be gas. It’s... it’s just the men.
29) 42) dialog: When our people are safe.
29) 44) dialog: Security must be earned, Rachel.
29) 47) dialog: (to the Radio Girl) On speaker, soldier. Over the tinny speaker, the voice of one of the female SE SERVICE AGENTS is heard. 40
29) 50) dialog: Perhaps, but all it would take is our enemies finding a single boy for them to resurrect their entire armies.
29) 52) dialog: You're welcome to question me, Colonel, but never in front of my troops. I’m your friend, but I’m also your superior.
29) 54) dialog: So what, you want to make bullshit romantic comedies to sedate the helpless widows? Rachel looks up at the big map with a hint of sadness.
29) 55) dialog: Or do you want to save the world?

They’re alone here, so Rachel can speak freely.
34) 2) dialog: The U.S. military isn’t an ally, Rachel, it’s a distant memory. All of their brass is dead, and the girls they coddled and refused to let fight are stranded in foreign theaters. Besides, the end justifies the means. The troop transport we used to fly to the States was too slow and unwieldy to keep up with the elusive Mister... Rachel consults her small field notebook.
34) 4) dialog: The fact that you still believe in a higher power after all this is charming. Rachel listens to something coming over her headphones.

34) 12) dialog: The fighting didn’t begin in earnest until the Israeli Defense Forces... sedated our Arab neighbors. As soon as we removed all of Israel’s external threats, the internal conflict that’s been simmering for years finally came to a boil. The helicopter BANKS into the sun.
34) 13) dialog: The same will happen to our friends in the States soon enough. Without an outside “evil” for its citizens to hate, poor will turn against rich, white against black...

40) 24) dialog: Why? You honestly think some undersexed American will be ina hurry to leave an entire village of lonely women?
45) 2) dialog: Thank you for your attention. The good news is that I have no interest in taking prisoners, so you don’t need to fear another incarceration. Alter pulls out her sidearm and AIMS it at Nina’s head.
45) 3) dialog: The bad news is that I have no objection to field executions. The rest of the townswomen start to rush to Nina’s defens but the overpowering I.D.F. soldiers back them off.

72) 9) dialog: You remember the punishment for treason, I trust? 102

Push past Alter into a close-up of Beth, still hostage in room behind her. The gagged girl has been watching this entire act of barbarism. Her eyes flash both fear and rag
74) 3) dialog: It’s over now. Beth promptly SPITS in Alter’s face.
74) 5) dialog: If you want to live to see your boyfriend, I'd advise against comparing me to the scum that slaughtered my grandfather.
74) 7) dialog: Your hatred is unjustified...

75) 3) dialog: The boy will be fine in a few hours. The gasmask-clad Yorick looks around to make sure that no is watching, before he reaches for one of the fallen Amaz REVOLVERS. He picks it up, and triumphantly RISES.

75) 8) dialog: Don’t tell me Yorick found himself a nice Jewish girl. But only half, no? Your mother must have found herself a nice Aryan to settle down with.
75) 10) dialog: A stupid tradition. Two of my siblings died at birth, so when my parents had me, they decided never to speak my real name aloud. (MORE )
75) 11) text: 105 ALTER (cont'd) The nickname is meant to deceive the Angel of Death, so that he’1ll never be able to find me. Beth just sneers.
75) 13) dialog: Really? Have you guessed my true name?
75) 17) dialog: Drop it before I open her. Yorick looks at the revolver in his trembling hand. There are only TWO BULLETS in its chambers. What if he misses? Reluctantly, Yorick lowers the weapon.
75) 22) dialog: This is not fucking couples therapy!
75) 26) dialog: If you want to help your girl, why the hell are you still talking?
75) 28) dialog: And what might that be?

As the dagger EMBEDS itself just below Yorick’s hand, the last man DROPS his weapon before it discharges. Alter RUNS for the fallen weapon, but Yorick KICKS it awa before she can get her hands on it. As Alter cautiously approaches him, Yorick YANKS the dagg out of his wrist. He’s trying to look like a badass as he wields the blade, but the pain is unbearable.
75) 36) dialog: You've never even met pain. Alter KICKS the knife out of Yorick’s hand before ferocio HEAD-BUTTING him between the eyes.

Alter then ROUND HOUSES the baton away from 355. It’s strictly hand-to-hand and woman-to-woman from here u the end. 355 taunts Alter, as she deftly uses her one goo arm to violently SPAR with her opponent.
76) 1) dialog: You're the one who killed my girls? Back in Marrisville?
76) 5) dialog: Who? Who do you work for? 355 says nothing, so Alter PUNCHES her in the face as har she can. Through bloody teeth, 355 spits out:

76) 8) dialog: Tell me, what number did your keepers give you? Maybe I’1l get it tattooed on my ass. A winded 355 struggles to whisper something inaudible.
