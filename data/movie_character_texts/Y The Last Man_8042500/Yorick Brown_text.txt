4) 1) dialog: It’s true. Jesse Garon Presley. He was an identical twin, stillborn a few minutes before Gladys gave birth to the King. They buried him in a shoebox. How insane is that? I mean, what if Jesse had lived and Elvis had died? Or vice versa? It’s destiny, right? Why does fate choose one man over another and all that? Cut across the desk to the unimpressed FEMALE EXECUTIVE w apparently been interviewing Yorick.
4) 3) dialog: I'm just saying, I’m more Elvis than Jesse. Plus, I’m a ninja with the grammar. Ma’am. The woman looks over Yorick’s resume.
4) 5) dialog: No, I’ve, uh, sorta been doing the Kerouac thing. Minus the road trip. Or traveling. Or leaving my apartment at all, really. I’ve been thinking. Mostly thinking.

7) 23) dialog: I’m so sorry. He’s supposed to be a helper monkey.
7) 25) dialog: It’s not for me. I volunteered to train this feces-slinging bastard to help quadriplegics with their daily chores and shit. I wanted to have him ready before you left, but he got stuck in customs after some kind of paperwork screw-up, so--
7) 27) dialog: I don’t know. I guess I just wanted to use my abundant free time to help people. I mean, you and the rest of my globetrotting pals are off saving the world or whatever, and I haven’t done a goddamn thing for anyone.
7) 29) dialog: Wait, me first. I’ve been meaning to say this for a long time. He opens the box, revealing a modest ENGAGEMENT RING. As speaks, Beth runs the water in the bathroom, just barely drowning out his quiet voice.
7) 30) dialog: Beth, you're brilliant and sexy and you know the names of all six and half of the Three Stooges. I didn’t even know they made women like you. I want to spend-- Yorick nervously SHUTS the little ring box as Beth steps of the bathroom, now wearing conservative attire.

25) 17) dialog: I don’t know, but whatever kept me alive must have also shielded this guy.

44) 19) dialog: Go on without me, Three. I’m tired of people dying. I’m... I’m just gonna surrender. 355 aims her weapon at Yorick. 72

47) 2) dialog: Yeah, well, guess I opened that door. A nervous Yorick just silently stares out the window as t craft barely skims the foliage.
47) 3) dialog: I can’t believe you really know how to fly this thing.
47) 5) dialog: How do you study espionage, exactly? Is there some kind of correspondence school?
47) 7) dialog: Foster care?
47) 9) dialog: Sorry.
47) 11) dialog: You know, before all this, I honestly wasn’t sure if your whole undercover sister spiel was legit, or if you were, you know... insane.
47) 14) dialog: (quietly, to Amp) Yeah, I’m gonna need a diaper change, too, buddy. 355 activates a few controls on her dash.
47) 16) dialog: We're still headed to this Attack of the Clones doctor?
47) 18) dialog: Yeah, but what if Victoria and her goons get to Mann’s joint first? We lost some time in Marrisville.

LAS VEGAS’S MCCARRAN AIRPORT - CONTINUING Cut over to the airport across the highway, where Yorick 355 calmly watch this conflagration. Their grounded helicopter is REFUELING next to a tanker truck at the Veg airport. Ampersand is playing on the hose connected to th Black Hawk.
50) 1) dialog: This is men’s fault, too, right? Because we taught our daughters to be showgirls instead of firemen?
50) 3) dialog: You know, I’m not the He-Man Woman- Hater you think I am. I didn’t roadie for Lilith Fair or anything, but I’m down with the cause. I rarely make sexist jokes, always hold doors open for ladies... Suddenly, 355 gets into a SPARRING position.
50) 4) dialog: I mean, I never hold doors open?
50) 6) dialog: I’ve gotten myself out of plenty of scrapes before, thanks.
50) 8) dialog: Double Dragon? What are you, forty? 355 playfully flicks him the finger.
50) 9) dialog: Like many a high school nerd, I survived bullies in the tried and true fashion of fighting like a girl.
50) 11) dialog: Scratching eyes, pulling hair, kicking balls. Not that the last one is so applicable anymore...
50) 13) dialog: What’s the point? You know what the strongest muscle in the human body is?
50) 15) dialog: No, it’s not the heart, you sappy fuck. It’s your jaw muscle. Even a scrawny dude like me has five hundred pounds of bite strength.
50) 17) dialog: Hey, before all this, did you, you know? Have somebody?
50) 19) dialog: Because of your job? 355 takes a deep breath. She softens a bit.
50) 21) dialog: Oh. Hey, look, what happened with Sonia...
50) 23) dialog: Yeah, well, I scored someone way above my pay grade. A wave of sadness suddenly washes over Yorick. 355 recognizes it and reaches out to touch his shoulder.
50) 25) dialog: How do you know?
50) 27) dialog: Okay, show me what you got, killer. 81 355 rises to meet him.
51) 6) dialog: Abandoned?
51) 8) dialog: And let you inspect the mad scientist’s haunted laboratory all by yourself? If you insist... Ampersand chirps as 355 walks into the black building. INT. DR. MANN’S LABORATORY -- CONTINUING 355 steps inside the eerily quiet building and draws her sidearm, just in case.
51) 43) dialog: Then this is one small step for man... 355 and Dr. Mann turn to see YORICK walk inside the room. Ampersand is on his shoulder, as always. 86
51) 44) dialog: Etcetera, etcetera. Mann’s jaw goes slack.
51) 46) dialog: I get that a lot. Much to Yorick’s surprise, the doctor rushes over to insp Ampersand.
51) 48) dialog: Uh, yeah. Actually, I’m also--
51) 50) dialog: Doc, the last time I delved into science on my own, it involved a baking soda volcano nearly blowing off one of my testicles. I was kinda hoping you had some answers.
51) 52) dialog: Online, at this volunteer group’s website. But maybe Ampersand... I don’t know, escaped from some Area 51 research facility first. He certainly seems at home here. Mann inspects Ampersand’s fur.
51) 55) dialog: I’m sorry, Three, but we gotta save the existential crises for later, right? (to Mann) Do whatever you need to get started, Doc, but there’s a crazy train blowing into town with your name on it, so we should really be out of here by morning. Mann ominously pulls on a single RUBBER GLOVE.
52) 8) dialog: Uh...
52) 12) dialog: But... how did it get inside me? 355 and Dr. Mann just stare at Yorick and Ampersand.
52) 13) dialog: Okay, that’s just sick. I did not blow my monkey!
52) 15) dialog: No, the only person he ever bit was... The truth slowly dawns on Yorick.
52) 16) dialog: Beth. JI fucked Beth. 355 and Dr. Mann just look at each other.
52) 17) dialog: Look, I had sex with my girlfriend, and Ampersand bit her. Whatever mojo saved the two of us must have come from Beth.
52) 20) dialog: Beth isn’t mildew, she’s a genius.
52) 23) dialog: Her shot. Beth’s been testing some kind of... of injectable contraceptive on herself.
52) 25) dialog: I knew it! I knew we should have been looking for Beth all along!
52) 30) dialog: Sounds like it’s coming from our copter. EXT. DR. MANN’S LABORATORY - CONTINUING 355 warily escorts her companions outside, as Yorick note flashing light on the helicopter’s cockpit. 91

53) 11) dialog: Like it’s not destabilized already? What difference is one less guy gonna make to the-- Just then, Yorick and the others are violently THROWN to ground, as the entire tail section of the Black Hawk EXPL after being struck by a S.A.M. missile. 355 groggily gets to her feet, and looks up to see a STAM of mounted Amazons charging down a hill in the background
53) 13) dialog: What? 93 355 yells at a temporarily deafened Yorick, who's holding terrified pet monkey.
53) 15) dialog: 
54) 0) text: Open tight on a “Y” logo, and pull out to reveal that it’ attached to the front of a 1990 YUGO CONVERTIBLE. Yorick and his companions race for this tiny vehicle, whi is parked in the narrow alleyway behind Mann's lab.
54) 1) dialog: A Yugo?!
55) 6) dialog: What’s this thing’s top speed, eleven?
58) 0) text: Cut inside this approaching vehicle, as a nervous Mann chauffeurs 355 and Yorick towards certain doom.
58) 3) dialog: That’s a combined fifty percent, baby. Even odds we live through this...
62) 3) dialog: Yeah, haven’t you ever seen two girls go at it over a guy, Doc? After the first slap, they forget he ever existed.
67) 2) dialog: Three...
67) 4) dialog: Three!
68) 0) text: Yorick calls after her, but 355 is already gone. As she dodges the crossfire, 355 DIVES for a row of hedges on th sidelines of this battle.
69) 0) text: Back inside the tiny car, Ampersand LEAPS out of Yorick’s arms and goes running out the car’s window after 355.
69) 1) dialog: Goddammit, Ampersand! Get back-- Yorick starts to open his door, but quickly closes it as HAIL OF GUNFIRE kicks up dirt just outside the car.
74) 0) text: Inside the vehicle, Mann watches this shocking display of chemical warfare with terror. A panicking Yorick fumbles for the little car’s buttons.
74) 1) dialog: The windows! But a frantic Mann quickly opens her door and starts to c outside.
75) 16) dialog: He confidently aims his weapon at Alter, but she immediat steps behind the still-bound Beth, and presses her pearl- handled DAGGER against the stunned girl’s throat.
75) 18) dialog: I’m sorry, Beth.
75) 20) dialog: No, not just about this. I’m... I’m sorry about before. I lied to you. Beth is confused, but Alter’s just impatient.
75) 23) dialog: I told you I got Ampersand because I wanted to help people, but really, I just wanted to impress you.
75) 25) dialog: I love you, Beth, but everything I’ve ever done, I’ve done for myself. I don’t know why fate chose a selfish bastard like me, but she made a huge mistake.
75) 27) dialog: Because, men are only better than women at one thing. Alter can’t resist.
75) 29) dialog: This. Suddenly, Yorick SPINS his revolver’s open wheel, before slamming it shut... and PRESSING THE GUN TO HIS OWN TEMPL He closes his eyes and plays his first round of Russian Roulette. CLICK.
75) 31) dialog: I’m useless to you dead, right? Let her go, or I punch my own ticket. 107
75) 33) dialog: All it takes is one, right? Push in close on the gun, as we see the one remaining bul start to move into position behind the revolver’s slowly descending hammer.
75) 35) dialog: AHH! Holy shit did that hurt! As Yorick continues to brandish the dagger, Alter suddenl CHARGES at him.
75) 45) dialog: Right, more like... your damsel in distress. 109 As Beth goes to work, Yorick whispers to her:
75) 46) dialog: Listen to me. Don’t worry about Alter. That gun... is empty now. You have... to let me die.
75) 48) dialog: The world’s... safer without me. Just-— Alter angrily aims her gun at the young lovers.
75) 52) dialog: Three! Alter then KICKS 355 in the stomach, sending the secret a flying out of the room. Alter runs out after her. Back in the suite, Beth is more confused than ever.
75) 54) dialog: (groggy) It’s... a long... And with that, Yorick slips into unconsciousness. 110
76) 15) dialog: Beth...? As the figure racks into focus, it turns out that it real is Beth. We’re again seeing the world through Yorick’s P.O.V.
76) 16) dialog: Beth, I... I had this fucked-up dream that--
76) 18) dialog: Damn.
76) 20) dialog: How long?
76) 22) dialog: Are you guys...? Mann puts a hand on Beth’s back.
76) 24) dialog: And 355? Low angle on the doorway to this room, as a figure carryi CANE steps inside.

76) 28) dialog: Does it have a sword in it? 355 just squints at him.
76) 29) dialog: Somebody gimme the post-game. Is that Israeli woman...?

76) 33) dialog: And the Amazons?

77) 5) dialog: Beth, there’s something I need to ask you.
77) 7) dialog: Oh.
77) 9) dialog: (nervously) Okay.
77) 11) dialog: What?
77) 13) dialog: But...
77) 16) dialog: That was a different world, Beth!
77) 18) dialog: But I’ve changed since then!
77) 21) dialog: Then why? Why am I here? Beth wipes away Yorick’s tears and kisses him, one last t
77) 31) dialog: What, does the hard-as-nails secret agent suck at good-byes? He stares 118
77) 33) dialog: Actually, the doc says she’s gotten everything important from Amp and me already. She took all the semen samples she needs while I was out. Not sure I want to know how she took them, but--
77) 35) dialog: You... you knew she was gonna dump me?
77) 37) dialog: Why is women’s intuition only right when it’s too late to do anything about it?
77) 39) dialog: Actually, I told her I’m leaving. 355 stops what she’s doing.
77) 41) dialog: I was kinda hoping to hitch a ride with you.
77) 43) dialog: Just hear me out. I know you ladies have the world under control. Beth was telling me the water’s back on in most cities and the nuclear power plants are cooling down and all that... but maybe there’s something out there that someone still needs a man for.
77) 45) dialog: (a beat) Opening jars?
77) 47) dialog: You sure about that? What if other... villainesses find out about this place? Burn it to the ground, God forbid. It’s not smart to keep all our sperm in one basket.
77) 49) dialog: Does that mean I can tag along? A long beat.
77) 52) dialog: Not the last man, Three. Yorick pulls out a CD from his bag, which he throws in th car’s sound system. 120
77) 53) dialog: Just the only one for now. Jay-Z's “99 Problems” comes to life over the speakers. Agent 355 reaches for the volume, and with a little half- smile, turns it up. We're looking at the car from above now, as it peels away from the hidden shelter, eventually slowing to stop at a in a clearly Y-SHAPED ROAD. We pull out farther, faster and faster, high into the AIR past the CLOUDS, past the UPPER ATMOSPHERE, until we’re o again in SPACE, taking in the serene blue planet, looking much like it did in the moments before the Plague. But this time, a LARGE OBJECT suddenly floats into frame.
