9) 0) text: The FRAME is full of cop faces... tough, mesomorphic face with a layer of fat under the skin, increasing as age.  T have the look of cops: alert, curious, weighing.  They ar city cops; they don't have that old-fashioned condemnator expression, there is an element of playfulness in their n the fact is they love their work, which is criminals.  Th is a peculiar delight in ferreting out the criminal impul in everybody, and a matching fury in punishing it -- whic is the action of repressing their own strongly developed  criminal unconscious.  These are tense, funny, violent, a rigidly controlled men. MORETTI is an old-line cop, a lot more relaxed than the  younger men and the cold professionals of the FBI, who as group resemble astronauts, and like them hide (but do not deny) the psychic chaos underneath. Right now they are looking at the sky.  We HEAR a heavy  helicopter track. We feature SHELDON, the silver-haired FBI Agent-in-Charge who looks like an accountant, and Moretti, with hat and c and a face out of Warner Brothers movies of the Forties. spite of Sheldon's age, Moretti plays though he's a smart kid who still needs a little help. Sheldon is getting out of a gray car, wears a gray suit. Three men with him are carbon copies of him at younger ag The three hang around him.  They approach Moretti who loo at them without moving.

9) 8) dialog: No, we don't know that yet.  This  young fella without the hat is FBI.   I'm Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti  ... M-O-R-E-double-T-I.  Eugene.  I  don't give a shit, but my wife cries  if you spell it wrong.

11) 11) text: A cop passing by presses a portable two-way radio into  Moretti's hand: He accepts it and holds as though he expe it.  The Cop passes the same type of set to certain other officers.  These sets are tuned in to each other, and  throughout the movie, there is a constant background talk these sets.  This is police procedure; the orders are for everyone to talk about everything.  If anyone has a quest has heard a rumor or a sound, whatever, it is immediately responded to, so that there can be the fewest possible  surprises.  Sample dialogue might go: "Did I hear a shot? "Over here, by the bank, there was a report like a gunsho inside."  "Roger, we heard that from the barbershop... it was inside the bank."  "Barbershop, you can see inside?" "Roger, we heard from the barbershop... it was inside the bank."  "Barbershop, you can see inside?"

11) 22) dialog: You frisk me.
11) 24) dialog: I'd like just some sign I can trust  you too, Sonny.  I don't want to  trust my body out where you could  just shoot me.  Some sight... right?

It is full of white-haired  officials, one of them the COMMISSIONER.  He has a voice  broken by whiskey, cigars, good food and yelling at footb games. DOLLY AT A LOW DRAMATIC ANGLE WITH MORETTI AND ETC. It looks like they may be going into action.  Moretti's  attitude is not that subtly different now he's talking to brass.  Commissioner doesn't get out; he talks through wi The Commissioner's hand, pudgy and freckled with age, cov Moretti's where it rests on the door: he massages Moretti hand fondly.

29) 4) dialog: I never make bets or guesses, that  way I'm never wrong and I never have  to pay out.
29) 6) text: A lot of comfortable CHUCKLES inside the limo.  The  Commissioner's hand lingers on Moretti's -- they are fond each other, these men, linked in a relationship of a life of shared experience, of attitudes, of maleness -- an  accumulation of years of jokes about being late for dinne of women waiting and women panting with desire, men secur in the bastion of their roles.  What is being passed on h is a purely emotional force of approval and acceptance fr top to bottom of a social institution that is the last to masculine society: police.  The homosexual content of thi should not be lost: it lies in the comfortable fit of the feelings, in the fact, simply, that they love each other, for what they share.
29) 7) dialog: So whatsa deal?
29) 9) dialog: What if we gotta kill a whole lot of  people?
29) 11) dialog: Listen.
29) 15) dialog: (pleasantly) Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want  help.

As they stop, we c see Sonny step into the door of the bank, in the distance He is greeted with CHEERS from the crowd.  But is intent the car. We are NOW SHOOTING ACROSS THE CAR, OVER MORETTI'S BACK T THE BANK and Sonny. The DRIVER of the police car gets out, with a huge grin o his face and nods to Moretti.  The back door opens and an cop gets out, also grinning.  They look around toward Son as his wife gets out of the police car, on this side.  Sh is spectacularly good looking in a lithe cruel sort of wa like Lauren Bacall, but right now she is a mess.
32) 3) dialog: (to cop driver) What's that?
32) 5) dialog: Jesus!

36) 17) dialog: He needed money?  For the operation  for you?
36) 19) dialog: Well, don't you figure you owe to  him to get him out of there?
36) 21) dialog: You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him  out of there and they might be a  little more understanding of your  case.
36) 23) dialog: How is he gonna hurt you on the  telephone?
36) 25) dialog: You think it over, Leon.
