Sure enough, the window of the barbershop across the street, the dim f of a man on a telephone can be SEEN looking out toward us He wears a hat in spite of the weather and a cigar is cla in his mouth.  He is an old-time, hard-nosed, uneducated, street-wise, sarcastic New York cop, outspoken, rude and  sentimental.  Right now he's a distant silhouette and a v on the telephone.

Near the window in a corner is a TV set, and on the TV set we are seeing the s of the police helicopter and the Cop yelling on the bullh as seen from the TV copter.  A couple of Elderly Men are  sitting watching the TV set, ignoring the bank, which the can see in the flesh, as it were.  Outside we are HEARING the copters, and on the TV set likewise, and the voice of the Announcer.

They move out onto the fire escape, a couple going higher, settling themselves down to aim in their rifles o the front of the bank.  A lot of AD LIB dialogue, but wha we note is the Cops, as a man, take a look at themselves the TV.
9) 0) text: The FRAME is full of cop faces... tough, mesomorphic face with a layer of fat under the skin, increasing as age.  T have the look of cops: alert, curious, weighing.  They ar city cops; they don't have that old-fashioned condemnator expression, there is an element of playfulness in their n the fact is they love their work, which is criminals.  Th is a peculiar delight in ferreting out the criminal impul in everybody, and a matching fury in punishing it -- whic is the action of repressing their own strongly developed  criminal unconscious.  These are tense, funny, violent, a rigidly controlled men. MORETTI is an old-line cop, a lot more relaxed than the  younger men and the cold professionals of the FBI, who as group resemble astronauts, and like them hide (but do not deny) the psychic chaos underneath. Right now they are looking at the sky.  We HEAR a heavy  helicopter track. We feature SHELDON, the silver-haired FBI Agent-in-Charge who looks like an accountant, and Moretti, with hat and c and a face out of Warner Brothers movies of the Forties. spite of Sheldon's age, Moretti plays though he's a smart kid who still needs a little help. Sheldon is getting out of a gray car, wears a gray suit. Three men with him are carbon copies of him at younger ag The three hang around him.  They approach Moretti who loo at them without moving.

Throughout this Cop is engaged in personal  business on the fringe of this affair, and though he's on duty he hardly knows what's happening on the robbery.

Fro here, while talking on the phone, Moretti can see the ban and through the uncurtained door he can even see some dis inside. Moretti picks up the phone.
11) 11) text: A cop passing by presses a portable two-way radio into  Moretti's hand: He accepts it and holds as though he expe it.  The Cop passes the same type of set to certain other officers.  These sets are tuned in to each other, and  throughout the movie, there is a constant background talk these sets.  This is police procedure; the orders are for everyone to talk about everything.  If anyone has a quest has heard a rumor or a sound, whatever, it is immediately responded to, so that there can be the fewest possible  surprises.  Sample dialogue might go: "Did I hear a shot? "Over here, by the bank, there was a report like a gunsho inside."  "Roger, we heard that from the barbershop... it was inside the bank."  "Barbershop, you can see inside?" "Roger, we heard from the barbershop... it was inside the bank."  "Barbershop, you can see inside?"  "Roger, this i the barbershop, we see inside, the perpetrator is moving  toward the rear of the bank."  "Who's that guy walking th the barricade?"  "The blue suit?"  "Yeah."  "Off-duty  Inspector come down to see can you use him."  Etc.
