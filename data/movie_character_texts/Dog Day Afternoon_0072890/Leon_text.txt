36) 6) dialog: I can't help it.  I can't stop him  from anything.
36) 8) dialog: He won't listen to anybody.  He's  been very crazy all summer.  Since  June he's been trying to kill me.
36) 10) dialog: What good is that?  They couldn't  stop him.  And it'd just make him  mad.  They don't know him.
36) 12) dialog: He was under great strain: you don't  understand, he's a very mixed up  person.
36) 14) dialog: He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never  met anyone like him.  His wife, he's  a wonderful father to his children.   His mother - you should see her -  his mother and father together are  like a bad car wreck - he lets it  all slide off his back, he sees them,  he pays their rent.  Unbelievable.   I wanted to get married... He didn't  really want it... he's married  already!  But he did it.  I don't  know why.  I thought it would help  me, but it didn't.  I was just as  confused and unhappy was before; I  did terrible things.
36) 16) dialog: Ten days I spent in Atlantic City -  Sonny was frantic - he knew I was  drinking; he didn't know where I  was... who I was with.  I couldn't  explain why I did the things I did.   So I went to this psychiatrist who  explained to me I was a woman in a  man's body.  So Sonny right away  wanted to get me money for a sex  change operation: but where was he  to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God,  he's in hock up to his ears already.
36) 18) dialog: It made him crazy - so much demand,  he'd fly into this rages.  And I got  more depressed than ever; I saw I'd  never get the operation.  So I tried  to take my life - I swallowed about  a half pound of pills...  blues,  reds, yellows, downers, uppers,  screamers... you name it.  But I  just threw them up and wound up in  the hospital.  Sonny comes there and  looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'   So when I hear he's in the bank, I  almost go crazy because I know he's  doin' it for me.
36) 20) dialog: I can't talk to him.
36) 22) dialog: I'm afraid.

54) 8) dialog: Ooohh...
54) 10) dialog: I'm really shakey.
54) 12) dialog: Yeah.  It was terrible.
54) 14) dialog: You come in and they say, right away,  that you are crazy.  And they start  putting things in your arm...  you  know.  How do they expect you to get  uncrazy if you're asleep all the  time?
54) 16) dialog: You can't talk or do anything.  You  really feel... you know... I'm just  sort of coming out of it now.
54) 18) dialog: Yeah.  So how are you?
54) 20) dialog: (chuckling) Yeah... I know.
54) 22) dialog: What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen  to yourself when you say that?
54) 24) dialog: What do you mean... what am I talking  about?  Do you realize that you say  that to me every day of your life?   I am dying.  Do you know... do you  realize the death that you are  spreading around to the people who  are around you?
54) 26) dialog: No really... I don't think that you  realize what it means.  The things  that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun  to somebody's head...
54) 28) dialog: (annoyed) Yeah... obviously you don't... when  you put a gun to somebody's head...   and you say go to sleep so that it  won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to  me.  I have been living with death  for the last six months.  Why do you  think I'm in the hospital?  I take a  handful of pills to get away from  you.  And then here I am out of the  hospital talking to you on the  phone... again.  I have no friends  left.  No job.  I can't live.  I  have to live with people.  This death  business... I'm sorry!
54) 30) dialog: (indifferent to Sonny) I'm sorry...
