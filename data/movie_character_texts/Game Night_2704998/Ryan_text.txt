2) 152) dialog: Sweet ride, Brooks.
2) 167) dialog: (a little impatient) Okay. You take a piece of paper from the bowl and then you give clues to the group and they try and guess who your celebrity is.

4) 6) dialog: Dude! Not cool. Everyone laughs.
4) 8) dialog: For the record. I didn’t have chlamydia. It was a pubic dermatitis.
4) 11) dialog: You're not supposed to target people with this game. It’s supposed to be generic things, like... never have I ever slept with a celebrity. The others nod. Without thinking, Michelle take a sip of drink. Halfway through the sip, she realizes Kevin is staring at her in surprise. She sets down her glass.
4) 19) dialog: (sotto) They’ve been together since middle school.
4) 30) dialog: Sunglasses at night. This guy’s the real deal. 34.

She looks down at it. The fight spills out of the living room and into the kitc INT.

4) 92) dialog: Brooks’ wallet? You think we should just steal all his shit?
4) 95) dialog: What are you doing?
4) 97) dialog: Whoa. You are a double threat: brains and sneakiness.
5) 19) dialog: Yes! You rock. He goes to hug her. Expecting a high-five, she puts up a hand. It’s awkward. He ends up hugging her hand.
