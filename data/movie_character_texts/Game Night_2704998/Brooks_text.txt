12) 9) dialog: Here. Hold this on there. The van closes in on their car.

12) 14) dialog: Yes. And I made a mistake. There’s this guy. They call him the Bulgarian. He has his fingers in all these pies around the world.
12) 16) dialog: Bad pies, Max. Pies that have heroin in them and guns and sex slaves. He asked me to find this Fabergé egg for him. And I found it. (MORE )
12) 18) dialog: But then I heard about this other guy, Marlon Freeman, who was willing to pay twice as much for the same egg.

26) 18) dialog: Look, I haven’t been totally honest with you. 91.
26) 20) dialog: I don’t mean about this. I mean about everything. I’m not the guy you think I am. I’m not even the guy you think I think I am.
26) 22) dialog: I’m a fraud. Everyone sees me as this cool, carefree dude who wins at everything he touches. Well, you know how I win? I cheat, Max. I cheat at everything. Even when we were little kids and we would play Battleship.
26) 24) dialog: Didn’t you notice how I always made you sit with your back to the TV? It was so I could see where your ships were in the reflection. And I always pocketed five grand in Monopoly before we even started playing. I cheated at the Game of Life. And the game of life.
26) 26) dialog: But it didn’t stop there. We grew up and you went to college and met Annie and became a writer. I knew I couldn't compete with your success. So I told everyone I got a job on Wall Street. And I did. Selling coke to the traders.

26) 30) dialog: (smiles) Kinda funny, huh?
26) 32) dialog: Okay, I’m not sure what that last thing means, but listen. I’ve been trying to find a way to make it up to you. That’s what this whole game night was supposed to be. I rigged it so you would finally win. The last clue was gonna lead you to your jacket pocket. Puzzled, Max reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out key to Brooks’ Stingray.
26) 34) dialog: Surprise. But I even fucked that up. I’m so sorry, man. He puts his forehead on the asphalt, defeated. Max puts a hand on his shoulder.

26) 99) dialog: That was my gun. Which was real.
26) 108) dialog: (pointing) Max? 99.
26) 110) dialog: No, Max...

39) 3) dialog: You get a bungee cord in your hand and you go straight to the pervy place, don’t you? Annie hurries onto the plane and hugs Max.
39) 11) dialog: Guilty.
39) 17) dialog: And that is how you throw a game night. Max and Annie stare.
39) 19) dialog: It went exactly as I planned. (to the Bulgarian) Trevor, you can get up now. Max and Annie exchange an incredulous look and turn to th Bulgarian. He doesn’t move. There’s a beat.
39) 20) dialog: I’m just fucking with you. That would’ve been cool though, right?
39) 22) dialog: Thanks for letting me host again.
39) 24) dialog: Only for another 36 months. Brooks sits down on the sofa and puts an arm around DR. C the fertility doctor.
