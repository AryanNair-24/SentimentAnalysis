2) 46) dialog: Well enough. Just checking the mail. Some people check it earlier in the day but there’s always a risk that the mail carrier hasn’t come yet. This spares me the chance of a futile trip to the mailbox.
2) 50) dialog: (pointedly, glancing at groceries) Any plans for this evening? Perhaps a game night?

17) 1) dialog: So, Jillian. How long have you and Ryan been a couple? 73.
17) 3) dialog: I see. I thought I detected a certain chemistry between the two of you. Jillian and Ryan do their best to laugh this off.

Ponytail gets hit in the gut, his shirt EXPLODING with red. Gary aims and fires. Bald Guy ducks too late and gets hit the back, dropping like a sack. A beat of quiet.
26) 57) dialog: I’m fine. (looking back) Though in sliding, my belt buckle may have scratched the finish of my squad car.
