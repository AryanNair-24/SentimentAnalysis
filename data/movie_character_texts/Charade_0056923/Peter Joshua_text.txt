Then the EMCEE picks up a basket of oranges and places on under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each at the head of the line. Blowing a whistle, a signal for game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the w behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from unde their chins to under the chins of the women -- without us their hands. (This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one' partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange again the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly  enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person n in line, where the process begins anew. However, the slig miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and s from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrie it -- again, with the chin only. This latter is an activi which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or e new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only a torment for total strangers and/or the English).
