Joe is surrounded by blond California guys as he gets off the plane.  We see a homemade banner "Welcome to L.A. St. Dymphna's Girls Academy."  Of the six people waiting, five of them look like Brezhnev.  The sixth is ANGELICA, she is holding aloft a sign which reads "JOSEPH BANKS."  She looks like Dede.  Joe does a take, he goes to her.  Several Catholic school girls run by.
