102) 4) dialog: No.  It is my soul.
102) 6) dialog: So do I.  I am Tobi.  Chief.
102) 8) dialog: I have learned.  You have come to stop the anger of the Woo? The Chief points upward.  Joe looks where he points.
102) 12) dialog: There was worry that you would not come.  You were to come before this.
102) 16) dialog: You're with him?
102) 20) dialog: Tonight, we will have a big feast. And then, at the end of the feast, we will climb to the top of the Big Woo, and you will jump in. Okay?
102) 22) dialog: The women will take this woman and make her clean for the feast. (shouts to the native women)
102) 26) dialog: And the men will take you and make you right for the feast. (shouts to the native men)
102) 27) text: Oliva!  Oliva! The native men leap up with a shout, seize Joe, and carry him off.  Other native men follow, carrying the trunks. The Chief, weary, heads back inside his hut.
110) 1) dialog: He's decked out, and he sits in his chair.  His Tobi is in another and there are empty chairs on each side. JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO - Rev. 8/25/89
110) 4) dialog: You look good, now.
110) 6) dialog: Joe Banks said your name is Graynamore.
110) 8) dialog: I've had talks with Samuel Harvey Graynamore.
110) 10) dialog: Your father is like the Big Woo. He must be fed or he will destroy the world.
110) 12) dialog: Maybe he ran away?  Maybe he don't want to jump in the Big Woo. Maybe he's swimming to someplace else.  Maybe he swam to that no good island over there. The Chief now calls to the natives.
110) 13) dialog: Oliva! Oliva! Bum bum bum.
114) 2) dialog: The Woo wants his flesh!
115) 3) dialog: So.  You didn't run away.
115) 13) dialog: His teeth have holes in them from drinking orange soda. Jump. The Chief hates Jump.
115) 15) dialog: There are those who want a man who will fix the holes.
115) 17) dialog: Yes. The Chief hates this idea.  The VOLCANO THUNDERS again. This time it shakes the ground a little.  They look.
115) 20) dialog: Joe Banks.  We are the children of children and we live as we are shown.  Now a change has come. The Waponis like this soda, and no one among my people will jump into the Big Woo.  They trade with this man, your father, for a hero.  We have no hero-of our own.  So we give this man the right to dig holes in the ground under us like the Jump digs holes in our teeth and in some short time we will be nothing but holes.  I am the Tobi. I cannot be the hero. It is my place to hope for my people.  But the Woo calls and no one from among my people says, I will go to my end for the rest of you.  Joe Banks. We are not your people.  Let us die. Take a boat and your woman and go to that no good island over there. (jerks his thumb)
115) 23) dialog: Once more I'll call among the Waponis for a hero. The Chief stands.  The Waponis abase themselves.  The Chief speaks to them solemnly.
115) 24) dialog: Who knew woe sue-weigh? Who knew woe? (he waits; as no one moves; he calls out once more)
115) 29) dialog: They are all afraid to die. There is no hero among them. They deserve to die. Joe stands.
117) 0) text: A head torch man leads the way up the mountain path.  He carries a heavy, lit torch that he swings from side to side with a ritual motion.  With each swing he lights another permanent tiki sconce along the path's upward progress.  He is followed by Joe, dapper and alone.  Joe in turn is followed by the Chief, who walks with a ritual movement, not unlike the bent-kneed gait of a Sumo wrestler, leaning first on one leg then on the other.  He is assisted in this gyration by two lackeys, one to his left, one to his right, who catch him as he leans to his most extreme angle and gently shoves him back the other way.  Behind the Chief, comes the general native population all of whom carry torches.
120) 2) dialog: No.  You just jump in. Joe nods.  Patricia breaks through the crowd and throws herself at Joe's feet.  She's sobbing.
121) 19) dialog: What?
121) 21) dialog: Okay.
121) 28) dialog: Do you want to marry her?
121) 30) dialog: Do you want to marry him?
121) 34) dialog: You're married.
121) 36) dialog: I'm going now. The Chief leaves.  The volcano has been ROARING LOUDER and LOUDER.  Joe stares into it.
121) 54) dialog: So. You did not want them. (to the retreating natives)
130) 11) dialog: (triumphantly gasping)
