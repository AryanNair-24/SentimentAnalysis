A gnarled human- like face can be made out on the surface of the tree. It is lit from beneath and slolwly brought up on a dimmer.  A horrible twisted tree face.  It suddenly opens its mouth and breathes in a gust of air with a terrible wheezing sound, as though in great pain at being brought to life.  It turns sharply towards the cabin.
