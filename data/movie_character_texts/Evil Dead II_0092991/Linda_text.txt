68) 1) text: The WALTZ MELODY fills the sound track, and the rotting corpse that was Linda begins to dance, bending and swaying as she sweeps gracefully through the evening fog.  A waltz of the dead. The style of dance begins to change.  It becomes more primitive.  The music changes to a more primal beat. The dance becomes sexually oriented.  Erotic, with sharp pelvic thrusts and gyrating hip motions.

160) 8) dialog: I'll never take it off. And then it hits him.  The emotion of love lost. It floods the monster that is ASH.  He clutches the necklace tightly to his bestial chest.  And as the Love/waltz theme sweeps up in volume on the sound track, the monster begins to cry.
