An unmarked CID sedan drifts to a stop and two plain clot Army investigators step out. By his bearing, LT. KIRKLAND is clearly the one in charge. They join the uniformed MPs already on scene, who are standing with Detective Hodge. Sanders has seen this before and knows what is happening. Lt. Kirklander hands a hundred foot tape measure to the M

64) 1) dialog: Sgt. Deerfield, this isn't necessary and it's not the way you want to remember your son.
68) 1) dialog: If it's all right, I'd like to give you a call tomorrow, before you go home, I have a few questions that--
68) 3) dialog: ...I can check with records and answer some of these things -- I take it your son didn't own a green car?
68) 5) dialog: A motorist reported seeing a green sedan parked on the shoulder near the field Saturday night. One theory is that this was a car-jacking or robbery gone wrong. There's been a real uptick in gang activity lately.
68) 7) dialog: I'm sorry, it's still an active crime scene. I'll let you know as soon as you can. (CONTINUED)
68) 11) dialog: A lot of the deaths we've seen like this have been drug related.
68) 13) dialog: I don't want to be asking anything.
68) 15) dialog: Not while they're in Iraq. (produces a small hash pipe in an plastic bag) We found this under your son's mattress. It won't go on my report, but why I ask...last month we arrested three soldiers trying to smuggle heroin in from Kuwait. They'd arranged to sell it to a local Mexican gang. I understand Mike spoke some Spanish.
68) 17) dialog: No, because somebody cut off his hands and his head. Hank turns and walks off. Kirklander watches, sizing him up.
91) 1) dialog: Would you like to sit down, ma'am?
91) 3) dialog: Yes, ma'am.
91) 5) dialog: Yes, ma'am.
91) 9) dialog: My deepest sympathies, ma'am. Hank walks her away down the long corridor.
106) 1) dialog: There you are. I just dropped something off for you.
106) 3) dialog: We took statements from the men in Mike's squad, thought you'd want them.
106) 5) dialog: Saved you the trouble.
106) 7) dialog: The sworn statements? On your desk?
106) 9) dialog: Listen, I was just trying to give you a leg up.
106) 11) dialog: I'm free for lunch. (CONTINUED)
106) 15) dialog: (laughs) Is that what I'm doing? Listen, read the statements; if you still want to question them, I will be glad to take the request to my CO.
106) 17) dialog: On your desk.
106) 19) dialog: You're gonna have to take that up with my Co.
106) 21) dialog: Well, this one is a bit of a jurisdictional mess.
106) 23) dialog: That's where it gets murky. (moving off) You read those, gimme a ring, glad to put in the request.
125) 29) dialog: (to Sanders) Did you notice the interview was over? (to Bonner) Let's go. Sanders continues as she walks them out into:
125) 35) dialog: You happy, or do you want to convene a war crimes tribunal? Sanders turns on her heels and storms back into --
125) 40) dialog: You can have the clothes. But you may want to glance at this. He hands her the manilla envelope. The way he said it mak her look at it with curiosity. She opens it and slides an 8x10 photo out -- black and white, a frame from a surveil camera posted at the guard gate: Bonner's car, Bonner dri Penning and Long the passengers. The time and date are stamped large, among other information. 1:26 AM. She understands the significance.
125) 41) dialog: Still want them?
140) 0) text: Sanders and Lt. Kirklander stand over the gurney.
140) 1) dialog: We found him hanging in his room. A morgue technician pulls back the sheet to reveal Gordon Bonner's horribly discolored face, his neck scarred and r
140) 3) dialog: No.
141) 2) dialog: It was in Bonner's pants pocket. The thought strikes Hank as amazing.
141) 4) dialog: I'm afraid it's as close as we're going to get to a confession. (CONTINUED)
141) 9) dialog: Blue. Why?
160) 2) dialog: I can't give them to you.
160) 4) dialog: They're under arrest. Corporal Penning's come forward. He's implicated Specialists Long and Bonner.
160) 6) dialog: He'll do serious time.
160) 8) dialog: ...AS much as I could get.
160) 10) dialog: I'm not the only one who made a deal. Sanders gets a bad feeling. (CONTINUED)
160) 13) dialog: My CO talked to yours. One less headache. It's out of our hands. (beat) I'm sorry. Sanders takes this in, looks back to Hank, waiting in the outer office.
160) 15) dialog: Long isn't speaking, I'll get you Penning's statement.
160) 17) dialog: That's not going to happen.
160) 19) dialog: I know you're feeling burned....
160) 21) dialog: And how long do you think it would be until you're fired? (CONTINUED)
162) 2) dialog: When I made the deal, I didn't know it was Penning who did the stabbing. I read it wrong. She nods, understanding; she would have been fooled, too. She glances toward Hank, dreading having to talk to him. Kirklander heads back to his office and Sanders has no ch but to walk to the exit and join Hank.
