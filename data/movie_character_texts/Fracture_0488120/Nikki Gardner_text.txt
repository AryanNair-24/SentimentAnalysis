31) 0) text: Willy moves uneasily among clusters of laughing, chatting sparkling FORMAL-DRESSED PEOPLE. NIKKI GARDNER joins him, strolling alongside. She's his a but her elegant dress, unlike his tux, was made for her.
31) 6) dialog: You've been circling the lobby for half-an-hour now, like if you stopped you'd die.
31) 8) dialog: Why don't you talk to Bob?
31) 12) dialog: Nikki Gardner. Senior Associate, Wooton Sims.
31) 14) dialog: On Bob's orders.
31) 16) text: Nikki nods, considering this.      And him.
31) 19) dialog: You like opera?
31) 25) text: With a conspiratorial head-tip, Nikki moves toward the pl doors. Willy follows.
32) 1) dialog: Bob assigned you to my team. I'll supervise your case-work, steer you through the office arcana, and generally keep an eye on you.
32) 3) dialog: Kind of like a probation officer.
32) 4) text: Beat. Willy nods, meeting Nikki's gaze as she looks to ma sure he's got it.
32) 6) dialog: Wooton Sims expects absolute loyalty and a hundred-and-ten-percent performance. But: you get to work on legendary litigation. National, sometimes global, in scope. It's high- stakes. And cut-throat - even within the team. We burn out associates at an astonishing rate.
32) 14) dialog: Can I ask you something personal?
32) 18) dialog: We have a guy in our criminal division, fresh out of Yale, named Calvin Tyler. One of our very rich clients gets pulled over, D.U.I. - which is routine bullshit, so Calvin gets it. Against you. Next thing we know, Calvin is fired, and Bob Wooton, who has never even interviewed a junior associate before - let alone hired one - says you're on my team.
32) 22) dialog: Wow. You know what's brilliant about that?
32) 27) dialog: You didn't actually do anything all that wrong.
32) 30) dialog: You gonna get that?
32) 33) dialog: We need to talk about your transition timetable.
32) 35) dialog: Bob believes in trial-by-fire. He wants you up-to-speed two weeks from Tuesday, because we're getting on a plane to Chicago for depositions in a class-action against our biggest client, Armstead Pharmaceutical.
32) 38) dialog: That's catch-up on three years' work - and you haven't closed out your old job yet.
32) 41) dialog: You know, a little bit of fear can be a very healthy thing to have.
32) 46) text: Nikki sighs, smiles.    Enjoying him, somewhat reluctantl
32) 47) dialog: I'll have them put the Armstead materials in your new office.
37) 0) text: It's big. It's got a window. It's got a sofa. Undecorated except for a pile of materials &amp; boxes marked ARMSTEA PHARMACEUTICAL. Willy is filling out forms - tax, citizenship, benefits. doesn't notice Nikki when she comes to the door.
37) 11) text: Nikki nods.   Willy is silent.     She frowns.
37) 18) text: Beat.   Nikki considers Willy.
37) 22) text: Nikki sighs, smiles a little, against her will.      He's over...again. Willy shrugs, grins.    In the silence, the impossible electricity returns.    After a moment - to defuse it:
37) 33) dialog: I think it would be interesting.
44) 0) text: Crowded with UPSCALE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS.    Nikki is on cell-phone, hand over her other ear:
44) 1) dialog: Well - you've gotta admire the cleverness of it.
45) 1) dialog: Come on, Willy - give the devil his due.
46) 1) dialog: Okay: then listen - I checked with Bob on how he wants you to handle this.
46) 5) text: NIKKI (cont'd) Has LoBruto tried to take you off the case yet?
46) 7) dialog: Well, he pretty much has to if he's gonna save any face. So here's the strategy: you let him.
47) 1) dialog: Yeah, damage control. Stop getting your face on TV. As it is, I had to talk Bob down from cancelling your contract.
48) 0) text: Willy is staring down at the broken eggshell, barely listening to Nikki.
48) 1) dialog: But we've got to move fast and get out from under. Otherwise, and I quote: "Stick a fork in this kid's ass and turn him over, he's done."
48) 3) dialog: Willy: today, you got killed. The issue now is saving your new life.
50) 0) text: Nikki is sympathetic, misunderstanding Willy's quiet:
63) 0) text: A faux-Tudor Hancock Park dining room.   Wealthy, but liv in. JUDGE LEWIS GARDNER, your basic Henry Fonda/Jimmy Stewart type patriarch, carves a turkey at the head of a long tab wearing a worn and gravy-splattered apron. Platters circulate in both directions among Nikki's older siblings (BURTON and SANDRA), their spouses, their children. Willy sits next to Nikki, who is high-stylish despite the fact that she's dressed "casual."
63) 7) dialog: Ha ha. (To Willy:) Burton's a counsel for Sierra Club, and Sandra's ACLU - so they use the holidays as an opportunity to give me a hard time, because I can buy and sell them.
63) 9) text: Nikki gives Willy a did-I-tell-you? look.
63) 14) dialog: You know of any other family in America where the corporate lawyer who's going to make partner by thirty- five is the "black sheep"?
63) 20) dialog: (To Willy) You don't have to do this.
63) 41) text: Willy nods.   Beat.     To Nikki, uncomfortable:
63) 43) text: Nikki looks at Willy.
63) 49) dialog: That...doesn't make any sense. Lobruto has to do some kind of damage control -
63) 51) text: Silence.   Nikki is staring at him.    Angry.
63) 52) dialog: You are really stupid, did you know that?
63) 55) dialog: Where? The Evidence Store?! Oh, that's right - they open early the day after Thanksgiving. You're gonna be fine!
63) 59) dialog: You wanted corporate, right?! You wanted to play in the big leagues?!
63) 61) dialog: You go to all that trouble getting yourself in - and then you just pay no attention to wh-
63) 66) text: Nikki stops. Refusing to look around.     Ashamed at losi control, turns back to her food:
63) 67) dialog: Fine.
63) 69) text: Everyone eats in silence a moment - then Nikki tosses dow her napkin:
63) 70) dialog: I need to talk with you.
64) 2) dialog: Did you hear me, when I said Bob wanted you gone as soon as this thing broke?! Did you hear me say I went out on a limb to convince him -
64) 4) dialog: And what if you don't?
64) 6) dialog: You don't get it at all, do you?! You pulled a stunt to get yourself this job. Fine: you're a hot-shot! (Beat) Wooton Sims does not need hot-shots. Because you don't win. The firm wins. Bob wins.
64) 13) dialog: We told the man you're getting on a plane to Chicago, Tuesday.
64) 16) text: Nikki watches him dealing with it, sympathetic. The impossible feelings always running under the surface for have developed a darker, aching tone. If anything, strong
64) 19) text: He nods. Neither one moves. Judge Gardner enters cautious from the dining room - breaking the spell. Nikki nods goodbye to Willy, and goes out quickly without meeting her father's eye. Awkward pause.
71) 38) text: The Judge nods. Willy nods down. Trying to focus. He's got nothing, and everyone in the room knows it. He can hear it, he can fee it. There's a restless, hungry edge to the crowded courtroom. He stares into his open briefcase: the cell phone. Next to it: the first class ticket and Nikki's note. Willy glances back at the gallery. Nunally's eyes burn in him. In the back: Lobruto frowns, concerned.
73) 4) text: Willy won't look up. Nunally stares, agonized. Willy grimaces slightly, as if he feels his soul burning turning to ash and blowing away - - nods, closing the cell phone, sliding it under Nikki's note. Shuts the briefcase. Looks at the Judge.
74) 0) text: Nikki sits at her beautiful desk with stellar views out t windows behind her.
80) 11) text: As he calls in, Willy sees Nikki through the doors - one a half-dozen ASSOCIATES trailing in the wake of BOB WOOTO They all carry expensive business luggage, except Wooton who is powerful, perfectly groomed, and two decades older
80) 15) text: Wooton glances back at Nikki, eyes saying: don't take lon She nods as Wooton and the team continue to the elevators staying back by the glass doors to talk with Willy:
80) 17) dialog: I told him.
80) 19) dialog: You don't work with anyone.
80) 21) text: Nikki explodes - but quietly, not wanting the team to hea
80) 22) dialog: Jesus, Willy, wake up! It's over! What is wrong with you - it's first year law: that woman could fully recover and swear he shot her and it
80) 26) text: NIKKI (cont'd) wouldn't matter. Double jeopardy! You can't take him back into court!
80) 28) dialog: You've got no standing.
80) 30) dialog: What's the point, Willy?
80) 38) dialog: It's what it is.
80) 41) text: Ding!   The elevator.    Nikki grimaces, frustrated - and
80) 45) dialog: Oh I'm supposed to lose my job over your problems?!
80) 47) text: Willy grabs Nikki's arm to stop her, turn her around - an she shoves him away, hard, tears welling in her eyes - - Willy letting her go - as the Receptionist quietly call for help - - and Nikki hurries into the waiting elevator.     The As holding the doors lets them go.
80) 49) text: The doors begin to close. Willy stands facing the cluster lawyers in expensive suits, their expressions ranging fro pity to contempt - - except Nikki, whose eyes are full of shame and guilt an defensive anger. As the doors shut across them. Willy doesn't move.     Confused, humiliated, frustrated. He turns when a bunch of OTHER LAWYERS emerge from the offices, ready to act as bouncers. People gawk from behin the glass doors. Beat.   Willy holds up his palms.
