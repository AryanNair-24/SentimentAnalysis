WILLY SLOCUM works at a laptop on his second-hand desk, l by a solitary lamp. He is in his late-20s, good-looking. Short hair, office-p but athletic, wearing mis-matched sweats from Eastern Oklahoma State College. He jots a final note, sets his yellow legal pad aside. As goes to the closet-sized bathroom, pulling off his sweats and starting the tiny pre-fab shower, we linger on the la screen: rental listings for a new apartment.
21) 5) text: Willy savors the moment. Then he tucks the letter into an envelope, gets the heavy briefcase - goes to shut off the light and open the door - which swings about six inches, then clonks into somethi Willy grimaces.   Peeks out, goes to pound on a wall.

25) 2) dialog: Yes sir.
25) 4) dialog: Thank you.
25) 6) text: Willy considers his options.   He always does.
25) 7) dialog: I offered my losing cases in exchange for two or three of anyone else's possible convictions. They couldn't handle their workloads, and I prefer not to lose.

29) 8) dialog: Yes, ma'am.
29) 11) text: The Defense rises; Crawford hardly pays any attention to Judge - glancing back and noticing Nunally, whose eyes bo into him, haunted and burning. Crawford stares at him impassively a second, then turns t lean past his P.D. and watch Willy hastily skim the file.

32) 19) text: Willy weighs his options.    Decides to level:
32) 20) dialog: It was a good bust, so Calvin came to me for a deal. I told him if he could arrange an interview for me with Mr. Wooton, I would throw the case. I laid out his arguments and evidence for him - and I showed him how I would lose. Calvin set up my appointment for the day after our court date. Then he did what I had suggested in court - and I wiped the floor with him. Your client got the maximum. Next day, I met with Mr. Wooton. (Shrugs) Bob.
32) 28) dialog: Well - I wasn't entirely honest with Calvin.

Turns away: no gun. But now he's facing the big wooden bo of ball-bearings, sitting out in the middle of the room o the coffee table. Hide in plain sight. He walks over - pushes his fingers in, feels around. Nope. He sighs. Takes a ball-bearing, rolls it in his han Goes to the device - drops the ball in the slot. The machine is amazing.

114) 11) dialog: No: he shot her and she died. The fact that it took time - the fact that he went to trial in between, just for shooting her - doesn't matter. He fired a gun and caused her death, and that's murder. (Beat) If he can twist the law around - then so can we.

127) 4) dialog: After you'd used it.
127) 6) dialog: Then you told Nunally you'd put it down - if he put down his.
128) 0) text: Willy turns, looking into the alcove:
128) 1) dialog: That's why you moved her back there -
131) 4) dialog: And all you had to do was switch the guns back - in the commotion -
131) 6) dialog: - and then wait -

133) 18) dialog: First bullet goes into your wife.
133) 20) dialog: Then three more out the front of the house, to get some attention.
133) 22) dialog: Then while you're waiting for the show to begin - you have to reload Nunally's gun.
133) 26) dialog: I mean, you don't want him wondering where the hell four bullets went, considering he never fired his gun that night.
133) 27) text: - and slides the clip back into the gun, pleased. Willy nods, thinking it out.   Sure of himself. He sets the ball-bearing into the slot at the top of the machine -

133) 29) text: Crawford reacts. CLOSE: Crawford's fingers, putting the bullets in the cli Willy lets the ball go - watching it begin rolling down t ornate tracks.
