25) 17) text: Beat. Willy doesn't like the implied personal judgement, the only way it shows is how calm he stays.
29) 0) text: Willy slips self-consciously through the double-doors, wearing the tuxedo. He gets even more self-conscious when he notices a handfu local REPORTERS. He hurries in - - passing Nunally, in the back row. Nunally is making a g show of keeping it together...but it's only a show. JUDGE IRENE FELDMAN, 50-ish, looks over her half-glasses.
29) 4) dialog: Mr. Slocum. Nice to see a man who dresses for court.
29) 7) dialog: Grapevine has it the punch-line is Wooton Sims.
29) 9) dialog: Good for you, double-oh-seven. (Signaling the Bailiff) Let's see what public service is offering you by way of a send-off:
29) 11) text: The Defense rises; Crawford hardly pays any attention to Judge - glancing back and noticing Nunally, whose eyes bo into him, haunted and burning. Crawford stares at him impassively a second, then turns t lean past his P.D. and watch Willy hastily skim the file.
29) 17) dialog: And do you wish to enter a plea at this time?
29) 20) dialog: Do you have a problem with your appointed counsel, Mr. Crawford?
29) 24) text: The P.D. shuts up, taken aback. The Judge considers Crawford, thoughtful, then turns to Willy.
29) 25) dialog: Do the People have an objection or a comment for the record, Mr. Slocum?
29) 34) dialog: You don't need to look out for Mr. Slocum, Mr. Crawford. The District Attorney's office can shift another prosecutor to the case -
29) 37) dialog: Mr. Slocum?   He likes you.
29) 39) dialog: Mr. Crawford seems to understand his rights and responsibilities.
29) 41) dialog: I appreciate your concern for the dignity of my courtroom, Mr. Slocum - considering you're making the argument dressed as a game-show host. Unfortunately, the man is a tax-paying citizen, entitled by our Constitution to try and manipulate the legal system, like everybody else. (turning)
29) 45) text: JUDGE FELDMAN (cont'd) As for you, Mr. Crawford, I strongly urge you to retain counsel. Lack of same will not be grounds for appeal.
29) 47) dialog: Are the People ready to go to trial without a preliminary hearing?
29) 50) text: Crawford smiles at him, as the Judge opens her calendar.
38) 0) text: JUDGE ROBINSON presiding. A mid-sized crowd, including a REPORTERS. A UNIFORM COP is in the witness box, Willy sta in the Prosecution Table.
38) 19) dialog: Your witness, Mr. Crawford.
38) 34) text: Judge Robinson gives Willy a warning look.
38) 35) dialog: Mr. Crawford, you might want to object. The witness can't know your state of mind.
38) 38) text: Willy gives Judge Robinson an I-told-you-so shrug.     Tu Dr. Kang.
39) 13) dialog: I'm sorry - Mr. Crawford, did you say something?
39) 16) dialog: On what grounds?
39) 23) dialog: Why don't you just explain it in layman's terms.
39) 26) dialog: Mr. Crawford -
39) 34) dialog: Detective Nunally?
40) 0) text: The Judge grim, Willy panicked, Crawford calm.
40) 3) dialog: Mr. Crawford, I warned you about representing yourself.
40) 5) dialog: Mr. Slocum - is it true?
40) 10) text: The Judge and Willy look at Crawford like he's truly insa
40) 11) dialog: Excuse me?
40) 17) text: The Judge looks at Willy.    This is bad.    Thinking fas
40) 19) dialog: Mr. Slocum - your witness was intimate with the victim, and he assaulted the defendant during the arrest.
40) 23) dialog: He's got a point. They were alone in the house. The confession is no good.
40) 27) text: Crawford raises his eyebrows. Awkward silence.         Wi a deep breath. Turns to the Judge.
40) 32) dialog: In police custody. Arguably, in fear for his life. I'm sorry, Mr. Slocum - it's all 'fruit of the tainted tree.' We have to exclude all versions of the confession and any evidence collected by Lieutenant Nunally or by other police officers on the night he was present.
40) 36) dialog: Yes, I do. And I don't like it. But it's done, so we have to deal with it.
40) 38) dialog: Don't push it, Mr. Crawford. (Beat) What we're going to do is give Mr. Slocum a few days to regroup and come up with new evidence. If he doesn't - then you can go home. That's going to put us into the long weekend. We reconvene Monday morning.
63) 0) text: A faux-Tudor Hancock Park dining room.   Wealthy, but liv in. JUDGE LEWIS GARDNER, your basic Henry Fonda/Jimmy Stewart type patriarch, carves a turkey at the head of a long tab wearing a worn and gravy-splattered apron. Platters circulate in both directions among Nikki's older siblings (BURTON and SANDRA), their spouses, their children. Willy sits next to Nikki, who is high-stylish despite the fact that she's dressed "casual."
64) 19) text: He nods. Neither one moves. Judge Gardner enters cautious from the dining room - breaking the spell. Nikki nods goodbye to Willy, and goes out quickly without meeting her father's eye. Awkward pause.
64) 25) text: Willy looks at the kindly old judge, a little surprised. Gardner shrugs: my two cents.      He goes to a side-tabl the Yellow Pages.
71) 7) text: Crawford glances up at the Judge. Then at Gifford, as if he's just noticed him up there. Beat. Without getting up:
71) 22) text: The Judge hesitates.   Both men standing.
71) 23) dialog: On what grounds, Mr. Crawford?
71) 27) text: Willy stares at Crawford, stunned. As the Judge reluctant nods to the Bailiff to collect Crawford's pages and opens law book:
71) 31) dialog: Your legal skills seem to have improved over the long weekend, Mr. Crawford.
71) 32) text: While the Judge checks the citations, Crawford glances at Willy. Amused. Beat. Willy looks down - reaches into his briefcase, move his cell-phone out from under some papers. To where he ca get it easily. Looks back up at Crawford.   Smiles slightly.
71) 33) dialog: Mr. Slocum?
71) 34) text: Willy and Crawford turn to the Judge.
71) 35) dialog: Have you got any new evidence?
71) 38) text: The Judge nods. Willy nods down. Trying to focus. He's got nothing, and everyone in the room knows it. He can hear it, he can fee it. There's a restless, hungry edge to the crowded courtroom. He stares into his open briefcase: the cell phone. Next to it: the first class ticket and Nikki's note. Willy glances back at the gallery. Nunally's eyes burn in him. In the back: Lobruto frowns, concerned.
71) 39) dialog: Mr. Slocum?
73) 4) text: Willy won't look up. Nunally stares, agonized. Willy grimaces slightly, as if he feels his soul burning turning to ash and blowing away - - nods, closing the cell phone, sliding it under Nikki's note. Shuts the briefcase. Looks at the Judge.
73) 9) text: Judge Robinson looks at Willy a moment - then at Crawford who has been waiting, calm and polite. Very reluctantly:
73) 10) dialog: Motion to dismiss is granted.
73) 11) text: Uproar.   The Judge bangs his gavel -
73) 12) dialog: Order! The jury is released, with our apologies -
73) 14) dialog: - and the Defendant is free to go.
73) 15) text: Crawford gives the Judge a gentlemanly bow of the head. Willy begins to pack his papers into the briefcase.   Ref to look up. The Judge and the Bailiff might be saying other things, b no one is listening - SPECTATORS swarm up the aisles, out the hallway - and the Court starts to close down. Crawford comes over to Willy, holds out a hand. Willy looks him in the eye.   Doesn't move.   Crawford sh
83) 0) text: Willy's walking alongside Judge Robinson, as they leave t building. The Judge is wearing his "civilian clothes."
83) 1) dialog: What do the doctors say?
83) 3) dialog: What did the doctors say, Mr. Slocum?
83) 8) dialog: I'm sorry. I have no probable cause to issue a court order against Mr. Crawford - and he's protected agai-
83) 10) text: The Judge stops - giving Willy a hard eye: I'm sympatheti but yelling at me is not a smart approach. Willy looks at the Judge a second - hapless, frustrated, scared - then nods and shakes his head and turns away - hurrying off through the homeward-bound crowds. The Judge watches him go.   Grimaces.
89) 0) text: Judge Gardner pulls his car out to the street - - swerving hastily, as Willy's car skids alongside and fo him to the curb, horn honking. Willy pulls to a stop, blocking Gardner's way, and gets o of the car - holding up both palms: just wait.
