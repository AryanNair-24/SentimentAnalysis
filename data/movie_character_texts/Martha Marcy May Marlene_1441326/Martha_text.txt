21) 13) dialog: It's okay.
24) 9) dialog: Hey Max.
24) 20) dialog: I shouldn't. I'm not going to drink for awhile, I think it's a good idea for me.
24) 24) dialog: Patrick'll know.
26) 12) dialog: No. I can learn though.
26) 19) dialog: When do you think that'll happen?

28) 5) dialog: Good.
28) 16) dialog: Maybe that's better. Sorry, thanks.
28) 21) dialog: Why is the house so big?
28) 25) dialog: For two people, it's huge.
28) 29) dialog: So no one else lives here?
29) 3) dialog: 
29) 10) dialog: When?
29) 17) dialog: I lost it.
29) 21) dialog: I got used to not having it.
29) 30) dialog: Was it a big wedding?
29) 34) dialog: 
29) 39) dialog: Did she smoke like chimney and complain about everything. 24.
29) 46) dialog: You never had to live with her.
29) 50) dialog: She lived with me after mom died.
29) 60) dialog: 
29) 66) dialog: I hate her.
29) 81) dialog: Is it true married people don't fuck?
30) 5) dialog: You're kidding.
30) 9) dialog: Why does it matter?
30) 16) dialog: Whatever makes you happy mama bear.
31) 13) dialog: You microwaved chicken nuggets and fish sticks.
36) 7) dialog: Really?
36) 11) dialog: I can't remember anything, I just woke up on the floor and felt this pain -
36) 18) dialog: I'm not.
38) 7) dialog: Cleaning.
38) 14) dialog: Is Lucy coming?
38) 18) dialog: Oh.
38) 22) dialog: It's okay.
40) 8) dialog: Yeah.
40) 12) dialog: Fine. 31.
40) 18) dialog: No. Why?
40) 22) dialog: I don't know, it's normal I guess. She hasn't changed much.
40) 25) dialog: Where is she?
40) 29) dialog: Why?
40) 37) dialog: I can't imagine it Lucy holding a child. 
40) 41) dialog: She wouldn't know what to do with it.
40) 51) dialog: 
40) 57) dialog: Why?
40) 61) dialog: I lost track I guess.
40) 65) dialog: I didn't think Lucy would worry about me.
40) 70) dialog: Can I go swimming?
41) 8) dialog: No.
41) 16) dialog: I can't.
44) 11) dialog: Nothing!
44) 16) dialog: Sorry.
44) 22) dialog: It's been hard to sleep alone.
44) 36) dialog: I don't know. It's a big bed, you guys were on the other side.
44) 40) dialog: Sorry.
44) 44) dialog: Okay.
44) 48) dialog: Yeah.
44) 52) dialog: Because it's privte and it's not normal.
47) 3) dialog: Do you ever hear things hitting the roof at night?
47) 8) dialog: We had a garden where I lived?
47) 12) dialog: I'm good at some things.
47) 19) dialog: Who?
47) 25) dialog: What do you mean?
47) 29) dialog: No.
47) 36) dialog: Yes.
47) 40) dialog: He never hit me.
47) 45) dialog: I do.
47) 49) dialog: There's nothing to talk about. I had a boyfriend, he lied to me, I left. That's it, everything doesn't have to be a big
48) 10) dialog: You okay?
48) 14) dialog: You're not. You'll quit.
48) 17) dialog: Who's that?
48) 25) dialog: You think?
49) 4) dialog: Whose car was that?  40.
49) 10) dialog: Just curious.
50) 14) dialog: What's wrong with the tap?
50) 18) dialog: It's a waste.
52) 3) dialog: Did you know that guy?
52) 7) dialog: The guy in the store.
52) 11) dialog: He was looking at me like he knew me.
52) 16) dialog: I don't know, you tell me.
52) 20) dialog: 
52) 30) dialog: Just drive the car Lucy.
52) 34) dialog: Drive the car!
54) 3) dialog: We share all of this, if it fits, you can  wear it. 
54) 8) dialog: This is where we sleep. You can take any  bed that's open or you can sleep  downstairs. 
54) 13) dialog: We don't eat until the evening. 
54) 18) dialog: You'll get used to it. Your body doesn't  need that much food. You're taught to  overconsume. 
54) 23) dialog: Katie's, but we all help out. 
54) 29) dialog: Uh huh. 
54) 35) dialog: He only has boys. 
54) 39) dialog: You want to hold him? 
54) 44) dialog: Not if you don't want to. There are  plenty of jobs to be done. 
55) 6) dialog: Does Patrick know? 
55) 10) dialog: How was it?  45.
55) 16) dialog: Did he give you the money? 
55) 20) dialog: Do you tell him you're not? 
55) 32) dialog: Don't get the wrong idea Sarah. We don't  talk to our old families. 
55) 39) dialog: Hi Patrick, Did you meet Sarah yet? 
57) 5) dialog: I don't mind.
57) 9) dialog: Okay.
58) 6) dialog: Oh, hi.
58) 13) dialog: Nothing you don't want to. Drink this, it will help you relax.
58) 16) dialog: It's herbal. It's the start of your cleansing.
58) 19) dialog: We've all done it so you know there's nothing to worry about.
58) 23) dialog: 
58) 27) dialog: You look amazing. It's your special night with him, enjoy it, you'll be great.
60) 3) dialog: Shouldn't we start cooking?
60) 7) dialog: I thought we were going to cook.
60) 11) dialog: Oh, yeah.
60) 14) dialog: Do you ever have this thing where you can't tell if something's a memory or if it's something you've dreamed?
60) 21) dialog: No.
60) 29) dialog: I didn't think about it.
60) 33) dialog: We were far apart.
60) 37) dialog: 
60) 42) dialog: I took care of myself.
60) 46) dialog: Stop it.
60) 50) dialog: No.
60) 54) dialog: I know you don't think much of me but I knew what I was doing then and I still do. 50.
60) 60) dialog: I don't need your guidance, I never did.  I'm a teacher and a leader, you just never let me be that but now I know I am, I know who I am.
60) 66) dialog: 
60) 68) dialog: Just because we're sisters doesn't mean we need to talk about everything that comes into your head.
61) 5) dialog: For what?
61) 9) dialog: I don't know.
61) 15) dialog: No.
61) 19) dialog: Why?
61) 23) dialog: There are other ways to live.
61) 27) dialog: Sure.
61) 31) dialog: I don't know. People don't need careers, people should just exist.
61) 38) dialog: You can do that if you want to.
61) 42) dialog: 
61) 51) dialog: You don't know anything about it.
62) 5) dialog: Who's this?
62) 10) dialog: She not there?
62) 14) dialog: Where is she?
62) 18) dialog: Who is this?
64) 16) dialog: Alright, my turn. 
64) 36) dialog: What do you mean? 
64) 40) dialog: They're living animals. 
64) 57) dialog: I can't. 
64) 67) dialog: I trust you. 
65) 3) dialog: You okay? 
65) 8) dialog: Where are you going to go? 
65) 12) dialog: You don't want to do that. 
65) 16) dialog: Max, they're not rules. It's just common  sense. 
65) 20) dialog: It's not about taking shit. 
65) 26) dialog: And that's why you don't get to come.  You just don't get it. 
65) 32) dialog: You're still living with all the shit you  carried out there. You're the only one,  let it go. 
65) 36) dialog: No. You can't try. You have to stop. They  love you, they just want you to be  stronger. 
65) 41) dialog: You'll be okay. 
71) 7) dialog: Sorry.
71) 12) dialog: No. I can't sleep.
71) 18) dialog: I should try to sleep.
72) 7) dialog: It's alright. It's your house.
82) 3) dialog: You shouldn't smoke.
82) 9) dialog: Especially if you're trying to have a kid.
85) 6) dialog: What's you name?
85) 12) dialog: What's your name?
85) 19) dialog: I used to like this.
85) 25) dialog: I thought you weren't supposed to drink Mike.
85) 30) dialog: You think you're so fucking smart.
85) 35) dialog: We all need to leave.
85) 39) dialog: He's a fucking liar. We all need to leave.
85) 47) dialog: We have to leave. We all have to leave. I know him.
85) 54) dialog: You don't want to live with this Lucy.
86) 4) dialog: They're here.
86) 10) dialog: Don't touch me, you're not listening to me! 66.
88) 10) dialog: Uh huh.
89) 8) dialog: Thanks mom. I'm sorry I ruined the party.
89) 12) dialog: Is it over?
89) 16) dialog: That's good.
89) 20) dialog: I don't want it.
90) 4) dialog: We have to do something.
90) 11) dialog: Watts! 70.
92) 2) dialog: How long do you think we'll be down here?
93) 3) dialog: Do you feel alright? If you hit your head  you shouldn't sleep. 
93) 7) dialog: Do you know why we're down here? 
93) 12) dialog: What do you think it was?
93) 18) dialog: Do you still think about leaving?
93) 22) dialog: No. I just wanted to see about you.
95) 3) dialog: Hello?
95) 7) dialog: Who's this?
95) 12) dialog: Can I help you?
95) 18) dialog: It's Marlene Lewis. What's your last name Jane.
95) 23) dialog: I don't know, do you?
95) 26) dialog: It's a Jane.
96) 6) dialog: I know. Sorry Katie.
97) 3) dialog: What?
97) 7) dialog: Oh, nothing.
97) 10) dialog: Lucy?
97) 14) dialog: Is this from the past or is this now?
97) 18) dialog: I don't remember waking up this morning.
98) 3) dialog: Zoe?
98) 7) dialog: I can't stop feeling terrible for that poor man.
99) 10) dialog: I have.
99) 14) dialog: 
99) 23) dialog: I'm sorry.
100) 18) dialog: I was confused.
100) 22) dialog: I thought he was someone else.
100) 30) dialog: I'm sorry.
100) 34) dialog: I know.
100) 41) dialog: 
100) 48) dialog: Are you going to send me away?
100) 52) dialog: 
100) 59) dialog: Please, I can't be alone, please.
100) 64) dialog: Lucy?
100) 71) dialog: You're going to be a terrible mother.
102) 5) dialog: Yeah.
102) 9) dialog: I don't mind.
102) 13) dialog: Yeah.
102) 18) dialog: What's it like there?
102) 25) dialog: Yep.
