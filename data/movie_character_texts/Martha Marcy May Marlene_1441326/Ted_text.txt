40) 39) dialog: Why? 
40) 45) dialog: I want what Lucy wants.

40) 59) dialog: You disappeared. You haven't called in two years!
40) 63) dialog: It's good to let people know where you are Martha. People worry.

46) 17) dialog: I have a month to get this building up and running or the bank takes it.
46) 23) dialog: My point is, I don't need the extra stress.
46) 28) dialog: As complicated as it might be, we can't just keep ignoring the fact that her behavior is fucking insane.
53) 5) dialog: It's labor day, we always have it. 
53) 9) dialog: I've already invited clients.

61) 25) dialog: Really?
61) 29) dialog: Like what?
61) 36) dialog: I have moments when I would love to move to France and just exist but it doesn't work that way.
61) 40) dialog: It's not that simple.
61) 48) dialog: And what do you think the right way to live is? Being a hysterical mess and causing your family pain. You're eating my food and sleeping under my roof so watch your mouth. You're rude.
71) 5) dialog: Jesus Christ you scared me.
71) 10) dialog: Did I wake you?
71) 14) dialog: Me neither. I was going to watch a movie.

75) 10) dialog: Lucy! 61.
75) 16) dialog: No one was curling up with anybody.
75) 20) dialog: Jesus, I couldn't sleep, I was watching a movie, she came out and sat down and started watching with me. What am I supposed to do, tell her to leave?
75) 23) dialog: You're being ridiculous.
75) 28) dialog: Are you accusing me of something? Because if you are, I'd like you to say it out loud so you can hear how absurd it sounds.
75) 32) dialog: You ask me to make more of an effort. I try to do that and you get upset. I can't win.
85) 58) dialog: Calm down.
97) 25) dialog: What's going on?
97) 29) dialog: She needs to see someone. 74.
97) 35) dialog: I'll start looking into places tomorrow. We can arrange for her to be somewhere by Wednesday.
97) 39) dialog: I don't think she should stay with us anymore. We can't do anything for her when she's like this.
100) 12) dialog: She kicked me down the stairs. Jesus Christ, what's it going to take, Lucy.
104) 3) dialog: Jesus Christ. 
104) 7) dialog: Yeah.
