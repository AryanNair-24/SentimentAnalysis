8) 48) dialog: Martha!
12) 3) dialog: It's nice to see you.
12) 8) dialog: What's going on?
12) 12) dialog: You alright?
12) 16) dialog: You sure?
12) 20) dialog: You were pretty upset on the phone.
12) 26) dialog: To what?
12) 29) dialog: What happened?
12) 33) dialog: Who?
12) 37) dialog: Who?
12) 40) dialog: Your boyfriend?
12) 43) dialog: Did he hurt you?
12) 47) dialog: Are you sure?
12) 52) dialog: Did you guys break up?
12) 55) dialog: How long were you together?
12) 61) dialog: How long?
12) 65) dialog: And you were here the whole time?
12) 68) dialog: You've been back in New York for over a year and you haven't called me?
12) 73) dialog: Well, I'm glad you're here now.
13) 3) dialog: I made you some tea.
13) 8) dialog: Ted should be up from the city soon. He'll cook us some dinner.
13) 12) dialog: Of course.
14) 5) dialog: She seems okay.
14) 9) dialog: Not much, she's pretty tired.
14) 13) dialog: She had some boyfriend, they were living in the Catskills.
14) 17) dialog: It's okay.
14) 21) dialog: It's fine. She's here now.
14) 27) dialog: 
16) 3) dialog: Martha? Why are you on the floor?
16) 8) dialog: It's okay, you were in a deep sleep. Come have some breakfast.
17) 13) dialog: How do you like the house?
17) 17) dialog: Well I love it.
17) 22) dialog: Yeah. Do you still like to swim?
17) 26) dialog: We do. This is for weekends and holidays.
17) 29) dialog: Ted's finishing a new building down town and when it's done we're taking one of the new apartments. You want to see pictures?
17) 36) dialog: This is the view, the interiors are obviously not finished. It's nice right?
17) 40) dialog: We were supposed to move in the spring but construction halted, so, it'll just be a little while longer.
17) 45) dialog: Okay, sorry, no more work talk.
17) 48) dialog: Aren't you hungry?
17) 54) dialog: It's okay, I can fix you something later.
18) 5) dialog: Connecticut.
18) 9) dialog: From what?
18) 14) dialog: You mean where I picked you up? 14.
18) 19) dialog: About 3 hours.
20) 10) dialog: Martha! What are you doing?
20) 14) dialog: Would you put some clothes on, you can't swim naked. 17.
20) 20) dialog: You just can't. There are kids around and people come by.
20) 24) dialog: So you can't. We don't, just don't. I have a bathing suit you can borrow.
21) 3) dialog: Martha!
21) 7) dialog: You should eat.
21) 11) dialog: Okay. I'm sorry I got frustrated with you before.
22) 4) dialog: She's in a really deep sleep. I can't wake her.
22) 8) dialog: She's just really tired.
22) 13) dialog: A pain in my ass, yes.
28) 3) dialog: Good morning. How are you feeling today?
28) 7) dialog: There's this great juice shop in town, I got us a couple of juices.
28) 11) dialog: This one is Kale with ginseng. It gives me energy, so I thought it might help you.
28) 14) dialog: I got pineapple orange too if that's better.
28) 18) dialog: I also got a box of these protein bars just in case you want to snack.
28) 23) dialog: It's not that big.
28) 27) dialog: We like to entertain. Our friends come up for weekends and sometimes we have parties. It's just good to have space.
28) 31) dialog: Of course no one else lives here.
29) 6) dialog: Yeah. 23.
29) 12) dialog: Earlier this year, in the spring.
29) 15) dialog: I tried to get in touch with you, apparently you got rid of your cell phone?
29) 19) dialog: You never got a new one?
29) 25) dialog: No thanks.
29) 32) dialog: No, about forty people. Mostly his family.
29) 37) dialog: Yeah.
29) 44) dialog: She's not that bad.
29) 55) dialog: College.
29) 58) dialog: Well I'm sure she'd love to know you're okay.
29) 63) dialog: She doesn't hate you.
29) 69) dialog: Relax, I don't have any pictures of you.
29) 73) dialog: There you go!
29) 78) dialog: Don't shake it, that's a myth.
29) 83) dialog: What? No!
30) 3) dialog: Put this on.
30) 7) dialog: Your clothes are disgusting Martha, just try it.
30) 11) dialog: It just feels good to put on something nice and comfortable.
30) 14) dialog: It looks good you little shit.
30) 18) dialog: You're making fun of me and I think it looks really good.
31) 4) dialog: It's no good?
31) 8) dialog: It's not dry.
31) 11) dialog: It just needs a little salt. What are you laughing about I cooked for you your whole life.
32) 5) dialog: Yeah. I wish I didn't have to go  tomorrow. 
32) 9) dialog: No, I don't want to leave her alone. 
32) 16) dialog: Right. 
44) 5) dialog: 
44) 9) dialog: Martha, what are you doing?
44) 14) dialog: Jesus, you can't just come in like that.
44) 19) dialog: God damn it, what's wrong?
44) 29) dialog: 
44) 33) dialog: 
44) 38) dialog: You can't come into our room when we're having sex, that's not normal! It's  private.
44) 42) dialog: Don't apologize, I just want you to understand why it's not okay.
44) 46) dialog: Do you?
44) 50) dialog: Well?
44) 55) dialog: Just lie down Martha.
46) 3) dialog: I'm sorry you slept out here. Thanks for being patient.
46) 7) dialog: I just want to make sure she's okay.
46) 11) dialog: I know.
46) 15) dialog: I know you are.
46) 19) dialog: That has nothing to do with Martha. 37.
46) 25) dialog: I'm her only family. She needs to be able to depend on me right now.
47) 5) dialog: No. Maybe it's the pine cones.
47) 10) dialog: You're good.
47) 14) dialog: I know you are.
47) 17) dialog: Was he ever physical with you?
47) 21) dialog: Your boyfriend. 38.
47) 27) dialog: Did he ever, hit you?
47) 31) dialog: You had a bruised ear, and when you called me you were hysterical.
47) 34) dialog: Are you sure?
47) 38) dialog: You can tell me.
47) 43) dialog: I wish you felt more comfortable talking to me.
47) 47) dialog: So talk.
49) 8) dialog: I don't know. Why? 
49) 12) dialog: There's a hiking trail, people leave  their cars there all the time. 
50) 4) dialog: Sorry.
50) 9) dialog: You're going to hurt someone.
50) 12) dialog: Can you go get me a large jug of water.
50) 16) dialog: I like bottled.
50) 20) dialog: Will you get it or not? 41.
52) 5) dialog: What guy?
52) 9) dialog: The one you almost ran into? No.
52) 14) dialog: Like what?
52) 18) dialog: What are you talking about?
52) 23) dialog: 
52) 28) dialog: If you don't want guys to drool all over you, then wear more clothes-
52) 32) dialog: What?
53) 3) dialog: I don't think we should have the party. 
53) 7) dialog: Things are just too stressful right now. 
53) 11) dialog: I'm sure people would understand- 
53) 15) dialog: I just think it would be best. 
53) 19) dialog: For all of us. 
53) 23) dialog: And that's the end of it, because you say  so.  43.
57) 3) dialog: I'll do these if you want to go to bed.
57) 7) dialog: Get some sleep.
60) 5) dialog: I just made some potato salad. Ted's cooking the fish.
60) 9) dialog: We cooked last night.
60) 16) dialog: Not really.
60) 19) dialog: Do you blame me for anything?
60) 26) dialog: I don't know.
60) 31) dialog: Really?
60) 35) dialog: Sometimes I wonder if, maybe I could have taken better care of you.
60) 40) dialog: It does matter.
60) 44) dialog: I know you did. I think I could have done more though.
60) 48) dialog: Be honest with me, you never think about it?
60) 52) dialog: You're not angry at me?
60) 58) dialog: No, Martha, I think the world of you, I'm  just wondering if I should have come back  and kept you in school and helped you go  to college, you had so much potential.
60) 62) dialog: Teacher and a leader? What are you talking about? I always encouraged you to  do more, but you shut me out.
60) 65) dialog: 
61) 34) dialog: He's just saying we should start talking about what you're interested in. Maybe we can help you get some ideas together.
75) 5) dialog: You can not be serious right now.
75) 14) dialog: One minute you're going after Martha at the dinner table, then you're curling up together on the couch?
75) 18) dialog: You really do think I'm stupid don't you?
75) 25) dialog: You can lose your temper at will but when I get pissed off, I'm being crazy or ridiculous! I couldn't possibly be mad for a reason.
75) 30) dialog: Fuck you. I just want you to think about how walking in on that might make me feel.
75) 34) dialog: You're unbelievable.
82) 5) dialog: What? I don't smoke. 63.
82) 11) dialog: Maybe you should mind your own business.
82) 14) dialog: I can't deal with talking to anyone right now.
85) 33) dialog: Hey, what happenind?
85) 37) dialog: What?
85) 44) dialog: What are you talking about?
85) 49) dialog: Who?
85) 52) dialog: What the fuck is wrong with you?
85) 56) dialog: Martha.
86) 2) dialog: What are you talking about?
86) 8) dialog: Breath.
86) 14) dialog: Martha please try to breath. I don't know what you're talking about.
89) 3) dialog: It's too hot, let it cool for a minute.
89) 10) dialog: Everything was fine.
89) 14) dialog: Yes, you slept through the night.
89) 18) dialog: Are you going to drink the tea?
97) 5) dialog: Who's Katie?
97) 12) dialog: Yeah.
97) 16) dialog: What?
97) 20) dialog: Why don't you go sit down, I'll finish up.
97) 27) dialog: Who the fuck knows.
97) 33) dialog: I know.
97) 37) dialog: Places?
97) 42) dialog: I don't want to talk about it anymore.
100) 7) dialog: Are you alright?
100) 10) dialog: What the fuck happened?
100) 15) dialog: You could have killed him.
100) 20) dialog: About what, what are you so confused about?
100) 27) dialog: You thought he was someone else? What is wrong with you?
100) 32) dialog: You need help Martha.
100) 36) dialog: What happened to you?
100) 39) dialog: What happened to you?
100) 45) dialog: We're going to get you proper help.
100) 50) dialog: I don't know how to help you anymore.
100) 55) dialog: I can't help you. 78.
100) 61) dialog: We're trying to start a family and I don't trust you to be here.
100) 66) dialog: What?
100) 69) dialog: What?
100) 74) dialog: Do you have any money left?
100) 77) dialog: Of course you don't.
102) 3) dialog: Going swimming?
102) 7) dialog: It's a bit chilly.
102) 11) dialog: I think we both said some things last night that we didn't mean.
102) 15) dialog: We scheduled an appointment for you tomorrow morning.
102) 20) dialog: It looks nice.
102) 23) dialog: We're heading back to the city in about an hour. You'll be ready to go?
104) 5) dialog: Are you okay?
104) 9) dialog: Fucking idiot. What was he doing?
