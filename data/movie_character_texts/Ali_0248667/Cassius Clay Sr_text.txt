White towels are draped over his head onto his shoulders. Bundini chirps in his ear. Dundee, like a plumber, carryi the tools of his trade...a bucket, his swabs and Vaseline And they seem distant to Cassius. They reach the end of t corridor, and against the wall stand three or four older cigar guys. A curtain...the sounds from the arena drift into the hallway.

Other sounds happen...irrelevant to him...and now the distant sound of Liston coming into the ring...his bulked-up presence, the roar he inspires, somewhere over there. And all of a sudd Cassius turns to face the angry man who wishes him death. Cassius rocks left and right, like a tough kid on a corne ready to rumble. The hysteria act is gone; so is the boasting. Instead, there is only Cassius' stare. The effect is enigmatic: what is going on here? A Referee, like a distant bird, says something we don't hear...

And, now, infuriates Liston even more by merely walking away from Liston's big misses, provoking even wilder and more inaccurate Liston assaults.

35) 6) text: And Cassius, seizing opportunity, hits Liston with more combinations. If Cassius won Round One, probably but not certainly won Round Two, he now demonstrates he OWNS Roun Three. It's a symphony of classical Cassius Clay footwork flicked jabs that confuse, and, then, hard-hitting combinations that rock the presumably immovable Liston. N one told Sonny that Cassius could hit. And, at 210 pounds he hits HARD. Liston, angered, panicked, knows he's losin and goes after Cassius and misses wildly as the BELL ends Round Three...

43) 1) text: can't wait to get out. He shuffles. He circles. He fires combinations. In the early rounds, provoked by Cassius, Liston's anger caused him to abandon his fight plan. Now, having been proven futile, Liston's confidence is gone. He's left with nothing. Psychologically and athletically, Liston is defeated. The BELL. Liston's eyes contemplate the inevitable: face nine more rounds of this.
