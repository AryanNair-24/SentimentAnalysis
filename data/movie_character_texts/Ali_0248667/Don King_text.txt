151) 14) dialog: Because you miss the significance. I dream, as Martin Luther King once dreamt, that a man could be judged by the content of his mind. This is about black men helping black men, overcoming four hundred years of racial depression to the dawn of a new day of liberation...financial and otherwise.
151) 17) dialog: It will raise up the spirit of our inner cities. It will rise up and fill with hope the souls, the unrequited needs of the black proletariat, that is, the discouraged, dispirited, denigrated, denizens of the demimonde, that is called...the ghetto.
151) 21) text: Don King laughs. As the press digs King...MOVE ONTO Forem and here's what's wrong with all of this...we SEE that Foreman, eight years younger, two inches taller, almost a fast and seemingly twice as strong, is not beatable by Muhammad Ali. Foreman just doesn't hurt you, Foreman can kill you. How is Ali not going to get killed by this man

153) 1) text: Belinda's behind him. Bingham's there, Bundini, Angelo Dundee, Sarria. As they crowd to the door, we're shooting OVER ALI starting down the ramp. He looks up. We don't se what he sees. We see only the crowd of people at the foot of the ramp, including Don King in a dashiki and the crow on the tarmac.
165) 20) text: (she doesn't get it) We're here 'cause Don King got Mobutu to put up ten million dollars. Don King don't give a damn about Africa. He worse than Herbert.

168) 15) dialog: Not for six weeks.
168) 18) dialog: This is not a humorous situation, my champion. This postponement could be long, especially if George leaves.
168) 25) dialog: How right you are, my suspicious and short Italian brother. And my fiduciary responsibility to this first all-black promotion is like a garden in the African sun. It must grow! It must bloom! It cannot flower in the gloom and shade of postponement to some dome. Like the Astrodome, the Super-dome, any dome outta Zaire, where it be deprived of light and bled of water. 'Cause what gonna bleed...is money. A hemorrhage of cash. (sees it all) ...blood on the floor. Double hotel costs. Double travel costs. Airplanes. Food and beverage...
168) 29) dialog: (moves close to Ali) Muhammad. Find a way to get George to stay. Be Moses in reverse: do NOT let my people go! Stay the fuck right here, in Egypt, if you'll pardon my Swahili.
168) 33) dialog: What?
168) 37) dialog: Who cares?
168) 45) dialog: (irrepressible) If George goes? George goes, my champion, I will get you Joe Frazier. Ali-Frazier III...the fight everybody want to see.
169) 3) text: Don King laughs, nervously.   Ali is daring George to sta
169) 7) dialog: (double entendre) You bad!

195) 8) text: King is importuning Herbert, his hands work the air, gesticulating madly, building whole castles of hype and hustle. We can't hear what he's saying. Herbert listens. Then Don King stops and looks at him, and Herbert nods hi head "yes." Then Herbert starts saying something and Don King nods his head "yes." Whatever's happening here, a de for the future has been struck.
