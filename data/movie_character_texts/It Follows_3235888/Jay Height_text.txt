She smiles as they hop and peck - sharing food. A squirrel races along the wire causing the birds to fly Jay looks down - stretching her arms out in the hot water She looks at her hands and legs immersed in bubbles. The bright sun reflects against the surface. Something irritates her shoulder. Jay turns her head and at her upper arm just above the water. She sees a tiny re moving toward her elbow.
