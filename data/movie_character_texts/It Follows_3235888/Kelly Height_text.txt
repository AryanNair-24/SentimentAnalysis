The bright sun reflects against the surface. Something irritates her shoulder. Jay turns her head and at her upper arm just above the water. She sees a tiny re moving toward her elbow. She watches it closely for a moment, then lowers her arm the water, dispelling the tiny insect in a swirl. The glass door slides open - KELLY, Jay's 17-year-old sis leans out from the doorway in her summer clothes - it’s a Indian Summer.
