11) 1) dialog: (reading chart) So, you must be Peggy Olson. Joan Holloway sent you over. She's a great girl. How is Joan?

11) 22) dialog: I'm going to write you a prescription for Enovid. They're eleven dollars a month. But don't think you have to go out and become the town pump to get your money's worth. Excuse my French. Peggy smiles politely and takes the prescription.
