24) 42) dialog: This is the story.
24) 46) dialog: Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
24) 51) dialog: So they're probably here. (hardly missing a beat) You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it.  What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B.  DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
24) 56) dialog: (calling after him) Oh, I know all about integrity.  I know even more about persistence.  Look that one up.

We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow. (getting in his face) Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
31) 21) dialog: Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
44) 14) text: The car door slams shut as the pack descends.  MAX SAYER MILTON are amongst the frustrated reporters.  The limo screeches away.  A POLICE MOTORCYCLIST prevents anyone following.

55) 3) dialog: -- She goes to a major, Hollywood, A-list party and we don't get an interview, a comment, we don't even get a photograph?  Is that what you're telling me?
55) 9) dialog: 24-hour tail on Taransky?
55) 13) dialog: (referring to a "Confidential" FBI report) Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos? (irritated) What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
55) 18) dialog: (interest piqued) Which means they're significant. (beat) Incriminating. (beat) Perhaps, criminal. (getting excited) She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.

55) 25) dialog: (offering Milton a seat in front of the computer) I will when you're finished writing it.
55) 28) dialog: (disappointed in his protege) Am I wasting my time with you?  When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
55) 32) dialog: Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth. (to his nervous photographer) As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.

60) 12) dialog: (never averting his eyes from the screen) -- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event.  Do you realize what we have here?  We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.

91) 17) text: Max compares the shot to one of the current desert locati with the Holiday Inn in front of the mountain.

91) 24) text: Viktor is relieved that Max is only accusing him of fakin the background.
91) 26) dialog: (referring to a large bundle of other shots under his arm) I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
91) 30) dialog: -- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio. (afterthought) Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
91) 34) dialog: I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter.  Not to mention abduction.
91) 38) dialog: I don't buy the whole recluse scam.  How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control?  All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
91) 43) dialog: I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.

115) 13) text: Max produces a shot of SIMONE at the Oscars and holds it front of the old lady.
115) 17) dialog: (putting his hand on his heart) Who would think that "Saint Simone" would abandon her own mother?  I've been looking into the family history -- heartbreaking.  Most likely a biography to run over four issues... who knows, maybe there's a Pulitzer in there somewhere.
115) 21) text: Max hastily steps between Viktor and the Old Lady.
115) 23) dialog: That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
115) 27) dialog: I do? (recovering) Sure I do. (taking Viktor aside) Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
