19) 24) dialog: She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
19) 28) dialog: Only her brilliance.  To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off.
19) 29) text: Lainey regards the makeshift poster.
19) 31) dialog: I have a feeling mom is going to take you back after this.

50) 7) dialog: One thing bothered me.
50) 11) dialog: No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
50) 23) dialog: (not quite convinced) So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?

108) 16) dialog: She thinks you're with Simone.
108) 20) dialog: I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out. (shrug) Dinner, maybe.
108) 24) dialog: Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
108) 28) dialog: I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
108) 31) dialog: Why?  So I can tell my friends at school -- as if that validates my life somehow.  What's Simone going to say to a fourteen-year-old anyhow?  She's going to be polite because you're my father but we're not suddenly going to become friends -- we have nothing in common.  It's not going to be real.  Anyhow, she gets more beautiful in my head every day.  Why kill the dream?  What do they say, "don't get too close to your idols, they always disappoint you".
108) 36) dialog: I love you too, daddy.

116) 9) dialog: I know.  Thank her for me.
116) 12) text: Lainey averts her gaze.
116) 14) dialog: -- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
116) 18) dialog: The old Viktor Taransky. (finally blurting it out) I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
116) 22) dialog: There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone. (hasty exit) I've got to go, Dad.

132) 11) dialog: Because obviously she existed, right?
132) 15) dialog: So you did meet her?
132) 19) dialog: I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
132) 22) dialog: I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it  -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams.  But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
132) 26) dialog: -- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.

137) 16) dialog: (beaming) About you and mom?
137) 20) dialog: (sweet smile) Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
