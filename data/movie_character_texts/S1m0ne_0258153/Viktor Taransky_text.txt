2) 36) dialog: You know what, Nicola, you're right. (picking up her last piece of luggage) Here, let me help you with that. (holding the door for her) You ought to go.  The truth is I don't deserve you.  This film doesn't deserve you.  Frankly, it deserves much, much better.  The reason it's not working is because you're not about the work.

5) 33) dialog: We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages  -- They're mocking us, Elaine.  We're at their mercy. (staring wistful, into space) We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role.  We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
5) 37) dialog: (irritated at her infuriating logic) Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --

23) 14) dialog: Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
23) 22) dialog: Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
23) 26) dialog: (musing to himself) Almost right.
23) 30) dialog: I don't know if that's going to happen.
23) 34) dialog: As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
23) 38) dialog: Out of the question.  A circus like that?
23) 42) dialog: She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone. (leaving her on the steps) Leave the press conference to me.

At this time I will be conducting no interviews or making publicity appearances since I am really nothing without the beautiful worlds and characters Mr. Taransky creates for me.

Yours very truly, Simone".

24) 30) dialog: I thought I made it clear -- no questions regarding Simone. (bringing the press conference to a hasty conclusion) Now, I would like to close by announcing that Miss Simone begins production today on her next film, "Eternity Forever".  This project has been near and dear to my heart since I wrote it nine years ago. (a tinge of bitterness, then a smile) I Thank you.

26) 29) text: Viktor looks up, Simone mimicking his action.
26) 33) dialog: Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
26) 37) dialog: (pondering the enormity of the hoax) You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.

26) 66) dialog: No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
26) 70) dialog: You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast.  It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
26) 71) text: Viktor gets up and starts walking around the room, warmin his theme.  SIMONE moves in a VISUAL LOOP on the monitor, nodding attentively as if she's really interested.
26) 73) dialog: See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake. (voice raising in excitement) -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains.  Besides, what's real anymore?  These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
26) 77) dialog: The only real truth is in the work.
26) 81) dialog: Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...? (pondering his own question) Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him. (shaking the thought from his head) I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.

27) 34) dialog: (winking to Hal) You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
27) 38) dialog: You're so far off! (finally chuckles) Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star.  Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight. (a shrug of apology to the appalled Hal) Anyway, you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction... (covering phone, to Hal) I'll try to talk her into it.
27) 41) dialog: (into phone) ... Listen this is a bad place to talk... what?... sweetheart, I know you have charity work you want to do, I know you want to give back -- but remember, your greatest gift is your talent... we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend...

30) 15) dialog: Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
30) 19) dialog: How?
30) 23) dialog: You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.

There's too much to say -- these films they speak, they speak to the human condition.  We're changing lives.  No, revealing the truth now would be too cruel. (searching for more justification) Anyway, when you're seeking a greater truth -- in the work -- you are not so concerned with the lesser truths along the way.
41) 37) dialog: (irritated at her pricking his conscience) Why do you have to bring that up?  There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?

120) 73) dialog: (wounded) Who says that -- ? (shaking off the insult) -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
120) 77) dialog: -- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
120) 81) dialog: No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.

Now she's killing me.  She's a serial killer. (ducking out of sight of the billboard as if Simone is watching him) But I don't know how to stop her.  She's taken on a life of her own.  I can't just come clean -- make some confession.  I've defrauded millions -- they'd turn on me.  And I can't put the genie back in the bottle.  If she stopped working -- dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest.  I've tried to kill her career but they like her even more. (more desperate) What am I going to do, Hank?
123) 7) text: A thought occurs to Viktor.  He slowly rises from behind Hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.

124) 10) dialog: I know what you're thinking.  It's a phoney-baloney world.  The women are surgically enhanced, the athletes are on steroids, the singers are lip-syncing if they're even singing at all, the news is entertainment, the politicians are bought and paid for -- we're living one big lie.  So why shouldn't you live too?  You're more authentic than the people who adore you. (a trace of despair) And that's the problem.  You're looking at the real fraud.  I told myself this was all about the work but if that was the truth, it wouldn't matter to me -- and it does.  It wasn't that the artists had no respect for the art.  They had no respect for me.  Someone like you, you have so much love showered on you -- I just wanted to feel one tiny drop on my face.  I'm sorry, Simone.  Here I've been trying to convince the world that you exist, but I was really trying to convince them that I exist.  It's not that you aren't human, Simone, it's that I am.
