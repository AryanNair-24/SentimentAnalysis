4) 15) text: Elaine finally speaks up.
4) 17) dialog: Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
4) 23) dialog: We can't sell an unknown.  Nicola's soured on the project and we have to accept that.  If we ever want to be in the Nicola Anders business again, we have to cut our losses and shelve the picture.
4) 28) dialog: (a wince, addressing everyone but Viktor) Excuse us.
4) 29) text: Elaine ushers Viktor out of the screening room.
5) 1) text: ELAINE and VIKTOR talk in the shadow of an enormous soundstage.  They speak more freely in each other's compa
5) 3) dialog: God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
5) 10) dialog: (talking a piece of candy and eating it) Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
5) 14) dialog: -- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
5) 17) text: Elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as Viktor pac
5) 19) dialog: -- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
5) 23) dialog: -- What's wrong with that?
5) 27) dialog: The public decides who's on that list.
5) 31) dialog: It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
5) 35) dialog: (regarding him as if he's insane) You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
5) 39) dialog: (rolling her eyes) -- It's called a projector.
5) 43) dialog: Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
5) 47) dialog: (gesturing at the studio lot) -- Christ, Viktor, look around.  What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
5) 48) text: A pause.  Viktor reads Elaine's face.
5) 52) dialog: How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
5) 56) text: Elaine also eats some more candy -- a curiously intimate moment between them.
5) 58) dialog: (softening, a heart-to heart) I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor... (voice trails off) You want to talk severance?
5) 62) dialog: (confused) The picture's dead.
5) 66) dialog: (believing she's getting off lightly) They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
5) 70) dialog: Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If they're good, they get known.  And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse. (kissing him on the cheek as she departs in her studio golf cart) I'm sorry, Viktor.

23) 8) dialog: (re-emerging from the car) Where is she?
23) 12) dialog: (ignoring his sarcasm) Why isn't she with you?
23) 15) text: Elaine sighs, exasperated.
23) 17) dialog: (dismissing her colleagues) Back to work, everyone.  She's not here.
23) 20) dialog: Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
23) 24) dialog: I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot. (quickly changing tack) Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters. (reading from a newspaper) Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
23) 28) dialog: I can't wait to meet her.
23) 32) dialog: (confused) Why not?
23) 36) dialog: (face falling) Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
23) 40) dialog: Viktor, it's my studio.

35) 1) text: VIKTOR waits in an opulent drawing room.  Despite the eig degree temperature outside, a fire burns in the hearth.  ELAINE enters, waving a thick studio file.  Viktor's face falls, expecting a less business-related conversation.
35) 3) dialog: Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
35) 7) dialog: Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
35) 11) dialog: Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
35) 14) text: Elaine refers to her documents, bewildered.
35) 16) dialog: Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic. (referring to a column in the budget) You allowed nothing for limousine service.
35) 20) dialog: Hair and make-up?
35) 24) dialog: She was in the theater?  When?  Where?
35) 28) dialog: Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
35) 32) dialog: (concerned by an entry in the budget) Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
35) 36) dialog: There isn't one.
35) 40) dialog: (skeptical) Even the fall from the plane?
35) 44) dialog: Well, shoot it on the last day.
35) 45) text: Viktor regards Elaine with a condescending look.
35) 49) dialog: Which accounts for your percentage. (tossing the budget on the coffee table) When do I get to meet this dream?
35) 53) dialog: (smiles) I'll walk you out.
35) 54) text: Elaine escorts Viktor out to the lavish garden.
36) 1) text: ELAINE's demeanor softens.  She speaks to VIKTOR quietly, sympathetically.
36) 3) dialog: Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife. (correcting herself) Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
36) 7) dialog: (exasperated) Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
36) 11) dialog: Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of my feelings.  There's something about her I don't trust.
50) 1) text: VIKTOR watches the rough cut of "ETERNITY FOREVER" with ELAINE and daughter, LAINEY.  As usual, they are mesmeriz by the breath-taking beautiful SIMONE.  The scene ends. light go up.

50) 15) text: Elaine looks at Viktor for an explanation.
50) 19) dialog: That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
51) 1) text: VIKTOR escorts ELAINE and LAINEY to Elaine's car parked outside the theater.
51) 6) text: Elaine and Viktor linger a moment outside the car.
51) 11) dialog: (impressed by his responsible attitude) Maybe you're right. (gently teasing) Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
51) 15) dialog: (softening) I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
51) 19) dialog: Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
51) 23) dialog: I'd love to tell her myself. (cajoling) When are you going to let me meet her?
51) 27) dialog: Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
51) 31) dialog: (amused) That's true.
51) 37) dialog: You know how you can stop that.  She has to get out more. (climbing into the car) See you at the premiere.
51) 38) text: Elaine climbs into her car and drives away.
53) 2) text: He observes ELAINE, champagne in hand, and the younger KE schmoozing with a group of industry MOVERS and SHAKERS.
53) 6) dialog: Thank you.  I mean, it was a team effort --

53) 8) text: Viktor turns away -- just as Elaine turns to look at him.
53) 41) text: Several nearby GUESTS, including ELAINE, overhear.  They over each other.

56) 2) text: He looks up to see several studio carts parked outside hi soundstage.  A group of STUDIO EXECUTIVES, led by ELAINE, trying to break into the "CLOSED SET".  VIKTOR runs towar the door, throwing himself between the door and the executives.
56) 6) dialog: -- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
56) 17) dialog: -- She has to get out there and sell the film.
56) 29) dialog: -- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor. (trying to squeeze past Viktor) If you can't handle her, I will.
56) 32) text: Elaine and the executives are not convinced, they overpow Viktor.
56) 35) text: Too late.  Elaine and the suits force the lock and enter.

57) 10) dialog: So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
57) 14) dialog: -- I don't think that's necessary.  I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
57) 17) dialog: She's into computers.
57) 32) dialog: (concerned) Viktor, you should have said something.
57) 36) dialog: (seeing a new side of Viktor) You're so good to protect her like this.
57) 41) dialog: Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
57) 53) text: Viktor and Elaine are left alone.
57) 56) text: The photograph shows ELAINE, slightly inebriated at the premiere, SIMONE standing slightly behind her.
57) 58) dialog: She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
57) 62) dialog: (flattered) Really?
57) 66) dialog: I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
57) 69) text: Viktor watches Elaine make her way back to her studio car
61) 1) text: ELAINE, KENT and LAINEY watch the TV interview in Elaine' mansion with eager anticipation.

75) 8) dialog: Are you and Simone... (blurting it out) ... getting married?
75) 12) dialog: (covering, realizing she has given herself away) Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single. (quick change of topic) Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching.  She was spectacular.
75) 17) dialog: Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
75) 21) dialog: Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
75) 25) dialog: Yes, you do... (shrug) Anyway, tonight was a good start.
75) 29) dialog: It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
75) 30) text: Elaine hangs up.  Lainey approaches.
75) 34) dialog: (she thinks) Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
79) 1) text: ELAINE watches TV in her office.  She cannot change chann without finding Simone sitting in a chair giving generic answers.

106) 6) text: Regarding Viktor closely, Elaine's smile evaporates.
106) 8) dialog: ... Simone.
106) 12) dialog: (suddenly cool) I can imagine.

107) 1) text: ELAINE paces back and forth in front of her TV showing re runs of the SIMONE concert.  KENT cannot take his eyes of the screen.
107) 3) dialog: I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way.  It's cruel.
107) 7) dialog: Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
107) 11) dialog: (not hearing) I have to talk to her.
109) 1) text: Milli Vanilli's "GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE" plays on a car radio.  ELAINE, wearing a red power suit, drives home alo the freeway in bumper-to-bumper traffic.  Her car phone rings.  She turns down the radio and picks up.

109) 11) dialog: (looking around the freeway) Where are you?
109) 14) text: Elaine looks to the inside lane.  SIMONE, wearing sunglas phone to her ear, drives alongside.  Simone waves, somewh mechanically.  Elaine waves back.  They keep driving as t talk.
110) 6) dialog: No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
110) 10) dialog: I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
110) 14) dialog: (rueful smile) You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
110) 17) text: Viktor, losing concentration on his driving, drifts acros his lane, almost striking Elaine's car -- swerving back a the last second.
110) 19) dialog: My God, are you alright, Simone?

110) 27) dialog: We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
110) 31) dialog: Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.

110) 40) dialog: I'm glad we talked.
110) 43) text: Viktor's car swerves to the right.  Elaine looks back in rearview mirror, concerned.

120) 6) text: Elaine is over-dressed for her supposed errand.
120) 10) dialog: (feigning absent mindedness) Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday.  How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately... (peering past him) Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
120) 14) dialog: When is she coming over?
120) 18) dialog: I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
120) 19) text: Elaine takes a seat on the sofa.  Viktor hands her a glas wine and sits beside her -- close.
120) 22) dialog: (trying to make conversation) Is Simone back to earth yet?
120) 26) dialog: I'm sure you'll keep her focussed.  She's lucky to have you, Viktor. (blurting out) Is she really having your baby?
120) 30) dialog: (instantly regretting the remark) I just read somewhere --
120) 34) dialog: -- And she was positively glowing at the awards. (making to leave) I should be going, she'll be here soon --
120) 39) dialog: (melting) I want you back too, Viktor.
120) 40) text: They kiss.  Elaine breaks the kiss, suddenly consumed wit doubt.
120) 42) dialog: This is crazy.  Who am I fooling?  I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
120) 46) dialog: That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice. (meeting his gaze) It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone.  There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
120) 50) dialog: Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
120) 54) dialog: But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
120) 58) dialog: (confused) Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
120) 62) dialog: You?
120) 67) dialog: (misinterpreting his remark) Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself.  No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert.  Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
120) 71) dialog: (ignoring him) -- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you.  Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
120) 75) dialog: How much wine have you had?
120) 79) dialog: (rolling her eyes) You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
120) 84) dialog: You made Simone? (a trace of pity) Viktor, she made you.
120) 85) text: Elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught Vikt alone in his house.
127) 3) text: VIKTOR, ELAINE and a curiously dry-eyed LAINEY walk behin the coffin.

132) 4) dialog: Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
132) 7) text: Elaine continues to pace as Lainey works.
132) 9) dialog: God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
132) 13) dialog: I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
132) 17) dialog: Of course.  What are you suggesting?
132) 20) text: Elaine regards her daughter curiously.
132) 24) dialog: (unable to refute it) Well, I --
132) 28) dialog: (trying to shake the notion from her head) Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
136) 1) text: A throng of REPORTERS, PAPARAZZI and ONLOOKERS parts like sea for VIKTOR, released from custody.  One placard reads "ASK JESUS TO SAVE YOU NOW".  He is escorted to a waiting limousine where he is met by ELAINE and LAINEY.  He hugs both.
137) 1) text: VIKTOR sits beside ELAINE.  LAINEY sits opposite, studyin her laptop computer.  Outside the car, REPORTERS are pres against the glass.
137) 5) dialog: (putting her arm around him) Don't thank us too fast, Viktor.  You know what we have to do?
137) 9) dialog: Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
137) 12) dialog: (holding Viktor close) I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
137) 25) dialog: (kissing him on the cheek) Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
