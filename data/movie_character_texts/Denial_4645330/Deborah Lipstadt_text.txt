11) 1) dialog: We have to accept there’1ll be many reasons why people may be deniers. When you look closely, they often have some agenda which they don’t own up to. In any field, denial may just be a pick to undo the lock and open the door to something else. A girl MEG, 18, in the audience puts up her hand.

11) 10) dialog: Let me tell you, I don’t see it that way. You can have opinions about the Holocaust. You can argue about why it happened and how it happened. But what I won’t do is meet with anyone - anyone - who says it didn’t happen. The Holocaust happened. It happened. That isn’t opinion. That’s fact. I won't debate fact. That way madness lies.

DEBORAH is on the floor in near-dark with the Mutt, staring unhappily at her own ima It still hurts. Pained, DEBORAH clicks to a film of IRVIN the square of the German town Halle, using a loudspeaker flag-waving skinheads and neo-Nazis. The sub-titles show telling Germans they no longer have anything to be ashame of. This is met with a chorus of ‘Sieg Heils’. He praises Rudolf Hess as a German hero. Then he is led to a van and driven away. Next, he’s speaking in a hall of American supporters. He’s articulate, persuasive.

23) 1) dialog: Holocaust denial rests essentially on four basic assertions.
24) 0) text: DEBORAH is speaking with vigour to her class. She points to the four ideas she has already pentelled in large letters, and underlines them one by one. She underlines 1. ‘Killings Not Systematic.’
24) 1) dialog: That there was never any systematic or organized attempt by the Nazis to kill all of Europe's Jews. She underlines 2. ‘Numbers Exaggerated.’
24) 2) dialog: That the number killed was far fewer than five or six million. She underlines 3.‘Auschwitz not built for extermination.’ 35 Full Blue Script // December 4th 2015 15.
24) 3) dialog: That there were no gas chambers or any specially built extermination facilities. She underlines 4. ‘Holocaust A Myth.’
24) 4) dialog: That the Holocaust is therefore a myth invented by Jews who use it to get themselves financial compensation and to advance the fortunes of the state of Israel. She then throws the pentel down and moves into the class a lawyer in court.
24) 5) dialog: War, they say, is a bloody business. There’s nothing special about the Jews. Jews are not unique in their suffering, they’re just everyday casualties of war. What's the fuss? DEBORAH looks as if genuinely asking that question. The students are confused.
24) 6) dialog: OK, and here’s another question: How do we prove the Holocaust happened? Seriously. I’m asking. How do we prove it? The class looks a little blank.
24) 7) dialog: Not a single person in this room or outside it has ever seen a photograph of Jews in a gas chamber. Why? Because the Germans made sure that none were taken. So how do we know so many were murdered? Because you saw Schindler’s List? I don’t think so. DEBORAH waits a moment, her concern real.

25) 2) dialog: Oh is that right? You know about this, do you? From what they’re telling me, if I fail to answer his challenge, if I give him a free ride, Irving can go to the American courts and get my property attached. He can take my home.
25) 4) dialog: The man’s a liar and someone needs to get out there and say so. They go and sit down with their food.
25) 6) dialog: I have two essential qualifications for Mr Irving. I’m a woman, and I’m a Jew. He gets more bang for his buck.
25) 8) dialog: Correct.
25) 10) dialog: 
25) 13) dialog: I called him ‘a Hitler partisan who distorted evidence in order to reach historically untenable conclusions.’ The words are engraved on her memory. LIBBY is deadpan.

29) 11) dialog: I’m the innocent party. A man accuses you of something and you have to prove he’s wrong? That’s against natural justice. In the US, there’s a presumption of innocence.
29) 14) dialog: I could come to terms with it. They both smile. JULIUS looks shrewdly at her a moment.
29) 16) dialog: I've read every word he’s written. I know some of the personal stuff. His father abandoned him when he was four. He fell in love with Hitler at the age of eight. His brother says he ran around bombed- out buildings in London in the blitz shouting ‘Heil Hitler...’ He’s self-educated. And extremely proud of it.
29) 18) dialog: I've heard it’s perfect.
29) 23) dialog: Adequate. JULIUS takes this in.
29) 25) dialog: But he’s an anti-Semite.
29) 27) dialog: But it’s not a detail. I think it’s at the centre of everything he thinks and does.
29) 29) dialog: He’s a liar and falsifier of history. JULIUS sustains his look to her.
29) 30) dialog: A few weeks ago, a survivor came to speak to my class. There’s a chain, isn’t there?
29) 32) dialog: A chain of testimony. Passing the torch. She leans in.
29) 36) dialog: Anthony, this isn’t random. A couple of years ago, Irving came all the way to Dekalb. Then there were threats. Now there’s a lawsuit. There’s a strategy underlying all this. My mother called me Devorah. It was her idea. Leader. Defender of her people. They both smile.
29) 37) dialog: There was an expectation. When I was a kid. My mother always said there was going to be an event. I was picked out, she said. I was chosen. Well, here it is.

36) 13) dialog: Do to Holocaust deniers what you did to the monarchy?
36) 15) dialog: I’ve prepared a document on the approach I think we should take. Our central claim should be that Irving is not a real historian.
36) 19) dialog: I recognize your voice. We've spoken, haven’t we?
36) 22) dialog: I don’t think we can. +e * HF
36) 25) dialog: We can’t take that route.
36) 27) dialog: I hope so. I certainly tried to be.
36) 40) dialog: Horror? More like disbelief. More like fury. A court of law has to be a lousy place to judge history. EVANS is shaking his head in corroboration.
36) 43) dialog: Yeah, and let’s think about this: what happens if we lose? We lose and what? Suddenly it’s respectable - it’s legal - to say the Holocaust didn’t happen? Unless I prove it did? Has anyone begun to think what that will mean? JULIUS is smiling tolerantly. He nods at LAURA to carry o
36) 49) dialog: Hang on, I don’t get this. What, the survivors won't appear?
36) 51) dialog: No survivors?
36) 53) dialog: Why not? Why the hell not?
36) 55) dialog: Before you settle on this strategy, can I point out the obvious contradiction?
36) 57) dialog: You once told me this trial might have implications for the fate of the whole Jewish people. Now you say you're not going to allow them to speak. The lawyers are looking as if working out what they’re tr to deal with here. When LIBSON speaks he’s tactful.
36) 60) dialog: Oh yeah, please, I’d love to understand the thinking.
36) 63) dialog: He’s not hiring lawyers?
36) 65) dialog: So what are you allowing?
36) 67) dialog: He mentions it on his website.
36) 69) dialog: You've been to see him? In person? DEBORAH is shocked, but JULIUS is smiling.
36) 81) dialog: They're letting you do that?

36) 115) dialog: How would I do that?

36) 118) dialog: If I may say so, Mr Irving thrives on exactly this kind of blackmail. If you’re Jewish, keep your head down, lay low, and be grateful. Here in England, you may like appeasement, but I don’t.
36) 120) dialog: Shouldn’t I? Then what word should I use?
