7) 3) dialog: (to bureau, joking) I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled. May I get a handkerchief, please? Francesca chuckles as she closes up the suitcase. Richard takes out a handkerchief from the drawer and closes it.
7) 8) dialog: I swear. Only filters and no more than half a pack a day. I got my orders.
7) 10) dialog: I know, I know. I'm kidding. You sure you don't want to come? Francesca looks at Richard with complete conviction.
7) 12) dialog: What are you going to do for four days as a woman of leisure?
7) 13) text: Same thing I do as a hired hand, only with less help. Francesca realizes this has hurt Richard's feelings. She smiles.
7) 14) dialog: I won't be able-to sleep ya know. Can't sleep without you next to me anymore.
32) 53) dialog: Franny?
32) 55) dialog: How are you?
32) 57) dialog: Just fine. We're all in one room. - Michael's on the couch and Carolyn's... (continues) She hears Robert's truck DOOR OPEN and CLOSE. She hears the MOTOR being turned ON. She half listens to Richard.
32) 59) dialog: We got our position in the fair. Not bad, although I would have liked to be third which is not too early and not too late. But I told Carolyn not to worry... (continues, if needed)
49) 0) text: Francesca sits in her slip, alone in a dressing room, with several dresses strewn about. The panic of inde- cision has set in. She looks at herself in the mirror and begins to doubt that seeing Robert is a good idea. Or perhaps she's imagining something that isn't there. And what about Richard? (CONTINUED )

82) 0) text: The rain has gotten heavier. Francesca places a bag of groceries on the front seat of the truck, then gets in herself to wait for Richard. She takes a deep breath and removes a handkerchief from her bag to wipe the raindrops from her face. She freezes -- THROUGH the windshield, she sees Robert standing in the rain beside his truck across the street, staring at her. Her heart stops. For a moment, she isn't even sure he's real. . The town moves about its business around them. But neither notice or care. Whatever safety or forgetfulness she felt is gone. Her feelings burst through. She sits there helpless before him -- willing to go or stay depending on what he did. He begins walking towards her. She prepares herself. Her life will change -- it has to. There's no turning back. But the closer Robert gets, the clearer he can see that she is crying. And he stops. (CONTINUED )

84) 5) dialog: What's he waiting for? Francesca looks up to see that traffic has cleared in all directions. But Robert doesn't move. Francesca knows he is going through the same thing as she is in that moment. And then she sees: Robert, knowing Francesca is watching, takes off the medallion and hangs it on his rear-view mirror -- touching it gently, as if he were touching her. Richard BEEPS his HORN lightly. But Robert's truck just sits there. Francesca's eyes begin to tear up. Her hand grips the door handle. She doesn't have the strength to stay -- and she doesn’t have the strength to leave. Suddenly, Kincaid's left signal light comes on. In a moment he'll be gone. Richard fiddles with the Chevy's RADIO. Robert slowly eases his old pickup into the intersection heading west, lowering his window to help with visibility Francesca squints through her tears and the rain and fog and sees the faded red paint on the door: "Kincaid Photography -- Bellingham, Washington.” As Robert completes the turn, Francesca can see his hair blowing in the wind from the open window. He begins to accelerate down 92 and rolls up the window.
