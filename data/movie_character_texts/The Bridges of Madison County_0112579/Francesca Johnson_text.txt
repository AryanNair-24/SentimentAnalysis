Michael and Carolyn look to each other first, before one removes the tapestry and the other tries the key. It fits. They open the chest to find: Camera equipment, a chain with a medallion that reads "FRANCESCA," three leather bound notebooks -- and a sealed envelope with "Carolyn or Michael" written on it.

6) 2) dialog: Michael! Carolyn! Richard! Dinner! (CONTINUED)
6) 5) dialog: Michael, what did I tell you about that door? Richard enters after Michael, letting the door slam the same way. Francesca is about to say something, but gives up. Carolyn enters and crosses to the kitchen RADIO. Leaning on the counter, she turns the dial to a COUNTRY station. This clearly irritates Francesca, but she knows there is no point in arguing. ~ Everyone sits and begins eating -- in complete silence except for the song. When Michael can't open the ketchup bottle, Francesca grabs it, palms the top skillfully and twists it off. She hands it back to Michael, who makes no comment. When Richard scans the table for something that obviously isn't there, Francesca is up out of her seat before he can ask, at the fridge, grabbing the sour cream, closing the fridge and back at the table with incredible swiftness. When Michael moves his big arm to reach for the salt, he knocks over his cup and saucer, which Francesca catches with both hands before they hit the floor. Her reflexes are like a trained athlete. Finally, Francesca is able to sit and sip her coffee. She watches her teenage daughter fill her plate with a blank expression that lets nothing slip through -- no indication of all the tempests of emotions that go through a teenage girl. FRANCE“SCA You excited about going, Carolyn? Without looking up, Carolyn fakes a smile. Francesca then looks to her son, shoveling food into his mouth at an alarming rate. She attempts a conversation.

She sits herself in an easy chair then flicks on a reading lamp and opens her book. After five seconds, she closes the book. She crosses to the TV and turns it ON, then turns it OFF before the picture tuned in. She turns and leans on the TV, flicking the ON/OFF switch ON and OFF as her mind wanders. She gets an idea. She crosses to the hi-fi and looks through several albums she got from her Columbia Record Club. But nothing inspires her and she quickly loses the desire for music. She's antsy. She has this time alone and she doesn't know how to spend it. She walks through the dining room, passing a china closet filled with fancy dishes and glasses. She stops. Shoved in the corner behind is an old, unopened bottle of brandy. She removes it, setting atop the dining table to open it, then quickly changes her mind and returns the brandy to its lonely spot on the shelf. CuT TO:

She - grabs a glass of iced tea from off the porch, takes a sip then presses the glass against her chest. Francesca looks up to the sun to clear her mind. It is blinding. When she looks back out onto her driveway, her vision is momentarily blurred. Until, slowly, out of the blur, she sees: A truck driving toward her house, kicking up dust, like some phantom appearing through the etheric plane. She sips her cool drink and blinks to regain her vision. The truck comes down her driveway and stops halfway. Francesca watches with suspicious curiosity as: The truck stops and ROBERT KINCAID steps out. Flashing his blue eyes in her direction, he smiles and says: ROBERT . Sorry to bother you but I've got a feeling I'm lost. Francesca remains guarded.

11) 19) dialog: The right and you go -- no. Not that fork, excuse me. Then you pass Peterson's -- Peterson's farm, and by the old schoolhouse you go left. It would be easier to tell you if the roads were marked.
11) 21) dialog: Well, I can take you if you want. Robert is pleased, but a bit surprised as is Francesca’ who anxiously recants:
11) 22) dialog: Or, I can tell you. I can take you or tell you. It's up to you. I don't care. Either way. Robert smiles, finding her sudden nervousness charming.
11) 27) dialog: No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait. (as he smiles) I just have to get my shoes.

14) 29) dialog: Sure, I'll have one. She takes a cigarette out of the pack. Robert drops the pack and, with the same hand, flicks open the Zippo and ignites it. Francesca leans over. The road is bumpy and a breeze blows through both windows. ee She cups her hands around his to shelter the flame. She feels his skin for a brief moment. She sits back and enjoys the ride and her cigarette as Robert lights up. Silence. They drive.

He watches her slip off one shoe, then the other -- never missing a beat of her preparation. He can't help eyeing her body. When she returns, she also has the flowers he picked for her arranged in a jelly glass. She places them on the table and sits.

20) 40) dialog: (without a pause) I'm supposed to say, ‘Just fine. It's quiet. The people are real nice.’ All of that's true, . mostly. It is quiet. And the . people are nice, in certain ways. We all help each other out. If someone gets sick or hurt, the neighbors pitch in and pick corn or harvest oats or do whatever needs to be done. In town, you can leave your car unlocked and let your children run without worrying about them. There are a lot of good things about the people here, and I respect them for those qualities.

Feeling the air against her skin, she decides to open it a bit more. She gets an idea. Standing, she looks to see if anyone is around -- though rationally she knows there isn't a soul for miles. She turns off the porch light. With a brave and daring impulse, she sheds her bathrobe and stands naked under the night sky. The air feels good against her body. She opens her arms up against the night sky and moon like an Indian priestess. Suddenly, she starts hitting her body as mosquitoes begin attacking her bare torso. Thwarted, she quickly covers herself with a robe and runs into the house.

She searches through it, then removes a section to reveal another compartment. It is filled with things she hasn't worn in years -- out of date earrings, pins, etc... Lying amongst these items is an Italian-looking medallion on a chain. She holds it lovingly and puts it on. Crossing to the window, she looks out and she sees the water pump Robert used that day.

Kincaid is in his element, moving about with ease as he works to capture the gorgeous light. Francesca is enjoying watching this performance -- his grace, the way the muscles in his forearms are working, the way he moves his body. As Kincaid moves into the creek and then up the other bank, she walks through the bridge to the other side. When she comes out the other end, he is crouched down and pointing a camera toward her.

Francesca looks at him and understands he is giving her full permission to explore whatever she wants. Hesitantly, she crosses to him and takes his plate away.

He stands at the sink rinsing out some utensils. Waiting for the water to turn hot, he looks out THROUGH the window above the sink. He sees a beauti- ful view of the night. He pauses as it strikes him that this is a view Francesca has seen a million times -- that soon She would not see ever again.

74) 14) dialog: You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here, it'll all change.

74) 22) dialog: We are the choices we've made, Robert. Robert rises and turns his back on her.

As if Robert was deciding to turn around or keep going. Francesca waits. Suddenly, the door to the truck flies open and Robert exits. Francesca loses all restraint. She opens the gate but her dress is caught on it. Robert stands by the truck. Francesca tears at the dress, ripping off a button which falls to the ground. She runs down the road. Seeing her, Robert runs towards her as well. They grab each other furiously. For these few moments, all considerations are gone. CAMERA PANS UP TO the road beyond Robert's truck. We see Richard's truck driving towards them. For a moment it seems as if they will be caught until we realize Richard's truck is being SUPERIMPOSED as the light gradually brightens to reveal:

She takes a deep breath and removes a handkerchief from her bag to wipe the raindrops from her face. She freezes -- THROUGH the windshield, she sees Robert standing in the rain beside his truck across the street, staring at her. Her heart stops. For a moment, she isn't even sure he's real. . The town moves about its business around them. But neither notice or care. Whatever safety or forgetfulness she felt is gone. Her feelings burst through. She sits there helpless before him -- willing to go or stay depending on what he did. He begins walking towards her. She prepares herself. Her life will change -- it has to. There's no turning back. But the closer Robert gets, the clearer he can see that she is crying. And he stops. (CONTINUED )
82) 6) dialog: For a moment, I didn't know where Iwas. And for a split second, the thought crossed my mind that he really didn't want me -- that it was easy to walk away.
83) 0) text: Their momentum brings them up right behind the old pick- up, and sitting high in the Chevy, Francesca can see a black tarpaulin lashed down tight in the back, outlining a suitcase and guitar case wedged in next to the spare tire lying flat. The back window is rain-spattered but part of his head is visible.
83) 1) dialog: Robert leaned over as if to get something from the glove box. Eight days ago he'd done that and his arm had brushed across my leg. A week ago I had been in Des Moines buying a new dress.

That didn't seem possible, but it was true. I had begun to understand what he already understood. Francesca sits frozen by her responsibilities, staring at that back window harder than she has ever looked at anything in her life.
84) 6) dialog: 'Oh, Christ -- oh, Jesus Christ Almighty... no!' (MORE) (CONTINUED)
84) 9) dialog: The words were inside of me. 'I was wrong, Robert, I was wrong to stay... but I can't go. Let me tell you again why I can't go... Tell me again why I should go.' I heard his voice coming back down the highway...
84) 11) dialog: (whispers ) Goodbye, Robert Kincaid. She begins to cry openly. Richard looks over at her.

The DINAH WASHINGTON SONG, "I'll Close My Eyes" evokes every feeling of love and loss within her. She begins to cry. She hears Richard enter the house. She stands out of sight, holding her hand to her mouth to muffle her crying. She hears:
87) 2) dialog: I almost told him. In that moment I felt as if I couldn't hold it “back. If he really loved me, maybe he'd understand. She returns to her meal. The family eats in silence.
87) 3) dialog: I was grateful for the silence that night. I realized love won't obey our expectations. Its mystery is pure and absolute. What Robert and I had, could not continue if we were together. What Richard and I shared would vanish if we were apart. But how I wanted to share this. How would our lives have changed if I had? Could anyone else have seen the beauty of it? cut TO: 82 83 84 94.
