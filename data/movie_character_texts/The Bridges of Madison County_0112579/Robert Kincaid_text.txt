When she looks back out onto her driveway, her vision is momentarily blurred. Until, slowly, out of the blur, she sees: A truck driving toward her house, kicking up dust, like some phantom appearing through the etheric plane. She sips her cool drink and blinks to regain her vision. The truck comes down her driveway and stops halfway. Francesca watches with suspicious curiosity as: The truck stops and ROBERT KINCAID steps out. Flashing his blue eyes in her direction, he smiles and says: ROBERT .

20) 36) dialog: Go ahead. TI won't tell anyone. Surprised, Francesca looks at him oddly -- as if he already knows and is giving her permission. Francesca is so taken by his understanding and acceptance, she lets the flood gates open, speaking faster than her mind can keep up -- (CONTINUED)
20) 42) dialog: I scribbled something in my notebook the other day for future use, just had the idea while driving along. That happens a lot. It goes like this: ‘The old dreams were good dreams; they didn't work out, but I'm glad I had them.’ I'm not sure what that means, but I'll use it somewhere. So I think I kind of know how you feel. Francesca smiles at him. For the first time, the smile seems warm and deep. She surprises herself. She doesn't want him to go.
20) 48) dialog: That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.

26) 4) dialog: Sure. Men cook.
27) 0) text: Robert and Francesca are in the middle of dinner. But instead of the usual silence that surrounds Johnson family eating, Francesca is mesmerized by Robert as he manages to eat and tell a story. The scene begins with a laugh from Francesca. :
27) 1) dialog: (laughs ) --. No, wait, it gets better. He stands up and acts it out for her.
27) 2) dialog: You have to get the full picture here. I have three cameras around my neck, a tripod in one hand and my pants down around my ankles. I thought this was a private bush. I look up and this gorilla is staring at me with what can best be described as the most lascivious expression I've ever seen on a body with so much hair. Francesca laughs.

27) 12) dialog: We got engaged. She laughs.
27) 14) dialog: I hope so, too. We still write. Francesca is laughing so hard she can't breathe. Robert loves making her laugh.
27) 16) dialog: Nah. L've tried. My writing's too technical I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
27) 18) dialog: {nods, smiles shyly) I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually. (CONTINUED)
27) 24) dialog: I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
27) 26) dialog: No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic likes their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm no artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the curse of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
27) 29) dialog: Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on. (changes subject) Did you love teaching?

27) 44) dialog: Well, it's the obvious choice but I think I'd have to say Africa. It's another world. Not just the people and ‘the cultures but the land, the colors you see at dawns and dusks -- and the life there. It charges every molecule of air. Francesca is fascinated, being drawn into his imagery. (CONTINUED )
27) 47) text: It's tangible -- the moment to moment of life and death, the co- habitation of man and beast, of beast and beast, who'll survive, who won't -- and there's no judgment about it. No right or wrong or imposed morality. It's just life. It's a voyeur's paradise really because those animals don't want anybody in their business. You can watch but at a distance. Robert smiles at her, sensing how in tune she is with his feelings.

28) 7) dialog: Right. Good stuff, Yeats. Realism, economy, sensuousness, beauty, magic. Appeals to my Irish heritage. She watches him with great appreciation. He smiles at her. Instead of looking away, their eyes remain locked . for a moment. There is clearly an attraction. They simultaneously look away and continue walking. Francesca's heart is beating a mile a minute yet she can't deny she is enjoying herself. Walking side hy side in silence, Francesca turns back occasionally to look at her house as they get further away from it. Suddenly, the more distant the house becomes, the more frightened she starts to feel. Something inside her knows she's going too far with this man -- too far from home. Although a part of her wants it, she is surprised to find a larger part of her finds it too unknown. She stops. .
28) 8) dialog: What's wrong? Francesca looks confused for a moment, not knowing what she wants. She can't move. She searches for a way out.
28) 10) dialog: How about both? 24 43.
29) 0) text: The room is illuminated by a single light over the kitchen sink. Francesca moves about the kitchen preparing coffee -- dropping the coffee pot basket, spilling the grounds. She acts tense. Robert sits at the table opening the brandy bottle Francesca almost opened the night before, aware of her mood. There are two brandy glasses in the cupboard that Robert takes down. Francesca gets the coffee going then sets the table with cups and saucers.
29) 1) dialog: You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
29) 3) dialog: Francesca?
29) 5) dialog: Are you alright?

29) 10) dialog: (smiles) : Nothing you can't tell your children about. Once again, he relieves her of fear and anxiety. He hands her a glass of brandy, raises his glass to shoulder level and moves it toward her. (CONTINUED)
29) 14) dialog: To ancient evenings and distant music. Francesca takes a short breath, touches her glass to his and smiles a little. They sit in comfortable silence, enjoying their brandy and coffee, smoking a little. The soft sounds of a hot summer night fill the air ~- a PHEASANT CALLS from the fields, a DOG BARKS twice in the distance, CRICKETS quietly SERENADE and a moth flutters against the sink light.
32) 0) text: Francesca sips her brandy. Robert sits across from her.
32) 2) dialog: Not at all. TI wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
32) 4) dialog: I never got lost. I was more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided to think of myself as some kind of world citizen.
32) 6) dialog: Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
32) 8) dialog: I'm a loner, not a monk. Francesca averts her eyes, before continuing her investigation. (CONTINUED)
32) 13) dialog: No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I.want to meet them all!
32) 15) dialog: I just think there are too many out there saying, ‘This is mine,' or, 'She's mine.’ Too many lines have. been drawn. :
32) 17) dialog: I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind. I embrace mystery.
32) 19) dialog: No.
32) 21) dialog: Not everyone's supposed to have a family. —
32) 23) dialog: I told you, I love other people.
32) 28) dialog: No. But I love them just the same.
32) 30) dialog: I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it’s not as normal or proper.
32) 32) dialog: (interrupting) I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movies.
32) 34) dialog: Do you want to leave your husband? is completely stunned and thrown off guard.
32) 36) dialog: My mistake. I apologize.
32) 40) dialog: I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
32) 42) dialog: I already apologized. Silence. Robert remains seated. Francesca remains at the sink.
32) 43) dialog: Roseman Bridge at dawn, I'd better get going. . : (rises) Thank you for dinner. Pause. Francesca feels badly.
32) 45) dialog: No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask. Francesca shrugs it off.
32) 47) dialog: It's been a perfect evening. Just the way it is. Thank you. Francesca smiles. The possibility of a kiss hangs in the air between them until Robert turns to get his film out o the fridge. As he exits through the screen door, he stops. (CONTINUED)
32) 50) dialog: Thanks for the evening, the supper, the walk. They were all nice. You're a good person, ‘Francesca. Keep the brandy toward the front of the cupboard, maybe it will work out after awhile. He smiles and exits, catching the screen door before it slams. Robert takes a few steps down the porch and turns.
32) 51) dialog: One thing, though -- don't kid yourself, Francesca. You're anything but a simple woman. Francesca doesn't move for a moment, then crosses to the door as if to run after him, when she is stopped by the PHONE RINGING. She picks it up.
34) 0) text: Francesca is in front of a full-length mirror, her robe opened, applying Calomine lotion to insect bites. Suddenly, she stops to notice her body. CAMERA ANGLES OVER her shoulder. It is the first time in years she has actually stopped to look and touch her body running her hands gently over her curves, her neck, down the side of her thighs, her face, her breasts. She stops. She closes her robe and shuts off the light. She sits on the bed. . She gets an idea and crosses to a jewelry box on her bureau. She searches through it, then removes a section to reveal another compartment. It is filled with things she hasn't worn in years -- out of date earrings, pins, etc... Lying amongst these items is an Italian-looking medallion on a chain. She holds it lovingly and puts it on. Crossing to the window, she looks out and she sees the water pump Robert used that day.

44) 5) dialog: Got your note. W.B. Yeats as messenger and all that. I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read it. I stuffed the note into my pocket because the light was fading and I had to get my shots.
44) 7) dialog: I accept the invitation, but it might be late. The weather's pretty good, so I'm planning on shooting the Holliwell Bridge this evening. It could be after nine before I'm finished. Is that all right? Francesca frowns but manages to keep her voice from betraying her disappointment.
44) 9) dialog: If you want to come along while I'm shooting, that's fine. It won't bother me. I could stop by for you about five~thirty. Francesca pauses, then decides.
44) 14) dialog: About six. I'1l see you then. Okay? Bye. 54a. (CONTINUED )
45) 10) dialog: Got room right here if you like. She is surprised at his courtesy. Others are astounded. Some disgusted. She accepts his offer and sits beside him.
45) 12) dialog: Hot out there today. She nods and smiles. The Waitress tosses a menu at her and slams down a glass of water, then moves on down the counter. The Redfield Woman tries to act casual, glancing through the menu. Robert subtly scans the room as all eyes are on them, then turns away. (CONTINUED )

49) 0) text: Francesca sits in her slip, alone in a dressing room, with several dresses strewn about. The panic of inde- cision has set in. She looks at herself in the mirror and begins to doubt that seeing Robert is a good idea. Or perhaps she's imagining something that isn't there. And what about Richard? (CONTINUED )
50) 2) dialog: It's Robert.
50) 4) dialog: (with difficulty) Listen, don't take this the wrong way, but -- I'm wondering if this is such a good idea. (CONTINUED)
50) 8) dialog: I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with ‘that Redfield Woman.'
50) 10) dialog: The cashier at the general store was very generous.
50) 12) dialog: I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage. (seriously) If it's a problem for you to see me tonight, given the curiosity of small town people, don't feel pressured to do it. I'm not always so bright about other people's reactions and the last thing I want to do is to put you in any kind of situation that would...

By their expressions we can tell how glad they are to see each other. He extends his hand. She pauses, then takes it. He leads her to the bridge. CAMERA begins to PULL BACK and HOLD ON the scene. Kincaid is in his element, moving about with ease as he works to capture the gorgeous light. Francesca is enjoying watching this performance -- his grace, the way the muscles in his forearms are working, the way he moves his body. As Kincaid moves into the creek and then up the other bank, she walks through the bridge to the other side. When she comes out the other end, he is crouched down and pointing a camera toward her. He shoots three shots in rapid succession as Francesca walks toward him. She grins in mild embarrassment. Robert smiles back and continues his work.

On the RADIO, we hear DINAH WASHINGTON begin to sing, "If It's The Last Thing I Do" -- a heautiful, bluesy lovesong The PHONE RINGS. Francesca makes no move to answer it on the first RING, or the second. In the long silence between the second and third RINGS, Robert takes a deep breath and looks down at his camera bags. Francesca is finally able to move across the kitchen to answer the phone. Robert quietly takes a seat, his back to Francesca. The SONG PLAYS throughout.
55) 9) dialog: You're shaking. Are you cold?. Francesca shakes her head. They dance a bit more, but Francesca is shaking, which makes it difficult. They both stop. Robert places his huge hands on either side of Her face, gently stroking her hair away from her cheek. He whispers:

Robert glares at her jokingly. , Francesca hands him a dish rag. Robert wipes off the food revealing his bare leg. She reaches over and touches it. He looks at her and smiles.
