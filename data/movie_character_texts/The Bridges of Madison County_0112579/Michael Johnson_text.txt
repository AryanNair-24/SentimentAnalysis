2) 20) dialog: Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Prairie Hills. One for him, one for Mom.
2) 22) dialog: I don't care what it says! Maybe Mom was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let Dad buy two plots, huh?
2) 24) dialog: What?!
2) 28) dialog: Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
2) 32) dialog: Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her off some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.

2) 70) dialog: Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find Mom's relatives' addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
2) 72) dialog: I said no! (CONTINUED)

4) 13) dialog: Grateful!?
4) 15) dialog: (cuts her off) That's it! Grabbing the. letter, he starts putting everything back in the trunk.
4) 17) dialog: This is crazy. She waits ‘til she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.

30) 5) dialog: I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
30) 9) dialog: Then why do you? Carolyn laughs to herself -- she can't explain it to herself. She looks through the kitchen cabinets and gasps.
30) 11) dialog: What? Carolyn pulls out a newly bought jar of Fluffernutter.
30) 12) dialog: Wow. I bet it's been here since we were kids. You could probably spackle walls with it.
30) 14) dialog: She never ate this stuff. We used to have to beg her to buy it for us, remember? Realizing her mother did buy it for them, Carolyn's eyes fill up a little, her mother's death striking her for the first time.

67) 8) dialog: (sadly) Nobody did.
67) 10) dialog: Everything was during Betty. God, we were So young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
