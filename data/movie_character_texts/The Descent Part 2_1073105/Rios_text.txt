Will the same thing happen again with Rios as Sarah’s escape bait this time? As softly as she can, Rios creeps closer to Sarah. Across the cave, Sarah stands stock still. The crawlers stand between them. Finally, the Crawlers turn away, rush Dan’s body. Snarlin one another, they slowly drag him from the CAVE (in the direction Dan and Rios entered). They’re gone. Taking Beth’s pick, Sarah is already halfway up the TUNNE Faced with being alone in this hell, Rios scuttles to kee up.

57) 2) dialog: There’s no way through? That’s it? Sarah doesn’t respond. Shivering, Rios looks round. She’s willing to give up. Three walls meet at the cave’s apex. There’s a rough “window” halfway up a wall that leads to PASSAGEWAY .
