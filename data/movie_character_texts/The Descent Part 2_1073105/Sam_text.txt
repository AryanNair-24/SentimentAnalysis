53) 0) text: They stop just as suddenly. Teetering on the edge of a GO with a vertiginous drop below. As Cath moves her light back up, she illuminates... SAM. [From the first film.] Dead. Still hanging upside down from a rope in the rock ceiling One of her arms is missing - the shoulder is chewed to th bone. Her innards are spilled over her sides. Cath lurches back in horror. Greg looks at Cath, looks ba into the tunnel they came down. SCUFFLING. 59. Ahead, a deadly drop. Cath scans the roof for a route. Sa rope snakes back through pitons along the roof. Greg thinks fast, slams a piton into their near wall, loo the rope through it, pulls it taut. [The gravity of Sam’s bodyweight tugs the other end tight. ]
