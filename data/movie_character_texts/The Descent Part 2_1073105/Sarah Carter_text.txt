Her nerves wound tight, Juno works from “trunk” to “trunk She sweeps her light round. Shifts to a new stalagmite. Vaines follows her, terrified. Juno hears something SCRABBLE behind the stalagmite ahead She raises her pick. Psyches herself. Creeps slowly round Then spins out from behind the “trunk”. Launches the pick towards-- Nothing. There’s nothing there. Glimpses movement behind her, reflected in her pick. She spins. Swings her pick, just as another axe hurtles at Ju own face. Sparks fly as the two axes INTERLOCK. Sarah.

72) 18) dialog: Juno! Please. Juno has to lean down into the shaft to have a shot. It puts her directly in Vaines’s eyeline. He watches in horror as Juno aims the pick at his wrist. The collective weight shifts further back. One more pull Sarah’s gone too...
72) 19) dialog: Please. Juno slams the pick into Vaines’ wrist Vaines SCREAMS hideously. Rios watches on in shock. But Juno hacks again. And again. Through skin, sinew bone gristle, tendons. There are eight bones and four joints i the wrist. It’s bloody, grisly work. Again, Vaines is pulled harder, tendons strain, rip. Last tendon. Blood down him. Crawler on throat-- pulling them down. Juno has one last shot. A final sinew stretches and snaps as... Vaines falls away. The crawlers fall with him. Disappearing down into the dark Sarah hangs free. They hoist her up over the lip. Vaines’s severed hand dangles from her cuffs. Disgusted Sarah tries to shake it free. It remains persistently in place: takes some effort to get it loose. They back away from the drop.

The JANGLE of metal buckles against rock.. Juno hears crawler’s rustling. Nervous. Sarah holds the rope, taking Juno’s weight, her muscles burning, her hands burning against taut rope. Juno’s injured leg buckles as she struggles to yank herse up faster. She loses her grip, slips back to the bottom. Juno struggles to steady herself, flailing for handholds the smooth rockface. SLAM. Juno lands hard at the bottom- lets out a CRY. She grits her teeth against the pain. Too late. Crawlers stop eating! An eerie silence. Sarah can see two crawlers closing in on Juno below her Juno swings her pick, fending them off. Above her she can see Rios climbing towards the light. She could leave now and follow Rios.

A FIREBALL rolls through the cave, swallowing and smiting everything. Killing all CRAWLERS... Consuming the CAMCORDER: all the girls, in the cabin, laughing...
