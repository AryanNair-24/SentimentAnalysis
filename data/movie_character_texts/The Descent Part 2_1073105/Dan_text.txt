A CRAWLER. JAWS WIDE, COMING RIGHT AT HIM... Sharp teeth sever Dan’s jugular and vocal chords. He lets horrible wet harking gasps for air and for help. The dying Dan starts to crawl towards Sarah and Rios. Pul himself along on his back with the little strength he’s g Rios looks to Sarah. Sarah holds still, steely. No choice to let him die. 50.
