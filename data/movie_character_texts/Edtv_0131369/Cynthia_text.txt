1) 3) dialog: It's horrible, it's depressing, I love it. What else?
1) 7) dialog: I have an idea.
1) 9) dialog: This is something I've been thinking about for a long time. We're "Real TV" right? I mean that's the name of the station.
1) 11) dialog: So let's go real. We find someone. Just a regular person, someone. And we put their life on television - live... all day long.
1) 13) dialog: Calm down.
1) 17) dialog: No. We go way beyond that. We don't film it and edit it and put it on later. We go on the air live every morning and the show goes off each night, when our subject goes to bed. In between, we're on live all day, every day - the same person, -- for (shrugs) let's say a month.
1) 21) dialog: The hell we can't. Look, the beauty of being a cable  channel is we can take chances. I've thought about this and I'm telling you, I think this can make a noise. A loud one.

(more firmly) Someone's real life -- an TV, all day long - live... And, you know what? I'm doing it.

Plus we can sell advertising every second, running at the bottom of the screen... and the beauty is this guy doesn't even have to be good. I mean if he's good, great. But if he winds up making an ass of himself, better. McILVAINE How is that better?
18) 9) dialog: Come on. People cannot turn away from an accident. You drive by, you say "Ooh, I hope there's not a head lying in the road" but you look ! See, nobody in America wants to be nobody. This guy wants to be famous. So, basically, the deal is he agrees to drive down the highway a hundred miles an hour blindfolded and we get to see if his head winds up rolling down the highway. Fun for the whole family. So let's do it.
