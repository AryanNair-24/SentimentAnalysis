71) 0) text: The camera tilts upward from a Dixieland combo blaring ou bouncy tune to find Sarah, descending the stairs, looking at the party below. Holding the rail with one hand, and a champagne glass in the other, she maneuvers her way down steps. She stops a waitress on the way upstairs and excha her glass for a new one. We follow her unsteady, doll-lik descent. She moves slowly, dreamily past the combo; past  Eddie, who is cornered by a chic blonde in a low-cut dres past Findley, alone with his drink, observing his guests; past the bleary-eyed couples on the dance floor, until sh comes to the bar. Bert is there too, his head bobbing to the Dixie beat, hi eyes running over her body so plainly covered by a cotton print dress. Spinning away from him, she takes her glass goes to a corner of the room. Bert walks casually to her  side. He leans over and whispers something in her ear. He face hardens. Angrily she turns and throws her champagne his face and smashes her glass on the floor. Then she sta to cry and starts to fall, but Bert holds her up by the  shoulders. The music stops. The dance couples strain to g a look at what has happened. Eddie shoves through the gawking crowd.
