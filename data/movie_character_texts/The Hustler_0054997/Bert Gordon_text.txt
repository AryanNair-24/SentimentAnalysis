45) 10) dialog: Poker's not your game.
45) 12) dialog: Pool.
45) 14) dialog: I don't think there's a pool player  alive shoots better pool than I saw  you shoot the other night at Ames.  You got talent.
45) 16) dialog: Character.
45) 18) dialog: You're damned right I'm sure.  Everybody's got talent. I got talent.  You think you can play big-money  straight pool, or poker, for forty  straight hours on nothing but talent?  You think they call Minnesota Fats  the best in the country just 'cause  he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's  got more character in one finger  than you got in your whole skinny  body.
45) 20) dialog: He drank as much whisky as you did.
45) 22) dialog: You bet he knows how. (sips his drink) You think that's a talent too, huh?  Knowin' how to drink whisky? You  think Minnesota Fats was born knowin'  how to drink?

That's  the way he plays when he comes up  against a man who knows the way the  game is. He'll beat you flat four or  five games -- maybe more, depending  on how, uh... steady your nerves  are. But he might -- he just might  be a little scared of you, and that  could change things. But I wouldn't  count on it.
45) 31) dialog: See that big car parked out by the  fireplug on the way in? Well, that's  mine. I like that car. But I get a  new one every year because I make it  my business to know what guys like  you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do.  I made enough off of you the other  night to pay for it twice over.
45) 33) text: Bert laughs and signals the bartender for another round.
45) 34) dialog: Eddie, is it all right if I get  personal?

45) 38) dialog: First time in ten years I ever saw  Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked.  But you let him off.
45) 40) dialog: Sure, you got drunk. That's the best  excuse in the world for losing. No  trouble losing when you got a good  excuse. And winning! That can be  heavy on your back too. Like a monkey.  You drop that load too when you got  an excuse. All you gotta do is learn  to feel sorry for yourself. It's one  of the best indoor sports: feeling  sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed  by all, especially the born losers.
45) 42) dialog: Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
45) 44) dialog: Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota  Fats again.

45) 54) dialog: I never saw you do anything else.
45) 56) dialog: Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't  you? This game isn't like football.  Nobody pays you for yardage. When  you hustle you keep score real simple.  The end of the game you count up  your money. That's how you find out  who's best. That's the only way.
45) 58) dialog: I'm already rich. But I like action.  That's one thing I think you're good  for is action. Besides, like I say...  you got talent.

Clean, all set to  start all over again. Hold tight and  push hard. You know what you were  doing? You were waitin' to get beat.  Flattened out on your butt, swimmin'  around in glory. And whisky.
