39) 13) dialog: Who are the members of the household involved? What are their ages? 38.
39) 15) dialog: Yes... Carol Anne... Dr. Lesh writes five years old on the form.
39) 16) dialog: Has there been any publicity about the events?
39) 18) dialog: Can you be reasonably sure of not letting any get started?
39) 20) dialog: Would your family welcome a serious investigation of the disturbances, by someone who could make first- hand observations?
40) 2) dialog: How many disturbances have you recorded in this room?
40) 5) dialog: Ryan filmed an extraordinary episode during a case in Redlands.
40) 9) dialog: She casually looks in. 67 40. INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - DAY
41) 3) dialog: (embarrassed, backtracking) Well, Mrs. Freeling...
41) 5) dialog: The determination as to whether your home is haunted is not a very easy one. At that moment the coffee pot moves by itself to the tabl edge but doesn’t spill. Dr. Lesh tries to overlook this, appearances sake.
41) 6) dialog: What I meant to say was this could very well be a poltergeist intrusion instead of the classic haunting.
41) 10) dialog: Dr. Casey! Tak snaps out of it and looks down to adjust the lens set just as two more flashes go off in the air.
41) 14) dialog: (rattled) I was saying they are generally associated with an individual. 69 42. DR. LESH(cont'd) In the general vernacular, hauntings seems to be connected with an area... a house usually.
41) 17) dialog: Unless it’s a haunting. But as a rule, there seems to be no living person around whom haunting incidents revolve.
42) 9) dialog: (to Tak breathlessly) Look at the dog. He sits up on his hind legs and begs to no one we see.
42) 16) dialog: Tell her to stay away from it!
42) 20) dialog: It’s not a hoax.
44) 1) dialog: (to Ryan) Anything?
46) 12) dialog: (picking herself up) Have you ever heard of the term “teleportation”?
46) 15) dialog: Just about. In a recent case, objects which disappeared from a house would be seen much later falling to the ground outside.
46) 17) dialog: (to Steve) Where exactly do you suppose Carol Anne was playing before she vanished from sight?
46) 19) dialog: Let’s go up there.
46) 21) dialog: We’1ll just see about that. Lesh practically rolls up her sleeves and heads for the stairway, the rest following.
47) 1) dialog: What happened to you?
47) 5) dialog: Roll up your shirt. Let’s have a look. Tak turns to face the hall light and untucks his shirt rolling it up. Then rolling up his T-shirt. Everyone crow in to see.
47) 10) dialog: Let’s everybody spend the night down here.
48) 0) text: Dr. Lesh has returned to the living room. She bends over grabs the apron off the couch and pulls. It folds out. A convertible bed.
48) 1) dialog: Blankets, pillows, sheets. Let’s have a slumber party.
49) 4) dialog: (whispering) Shhh. More thrills than grading papers, wouldn’t you say?
49) 6) dialog: (whispering) If push comes to shove, I bet I’1l beat you to the door. (indicating monitors) Any movement out of those things?
50) 4) dialog: h, nonsense. I’1l1 tell you what is mbarrassing. My being here with ou nice people. Parapsychology sn’t something you master in. here are no certificates of raduation, no license to practice. ’m a professional psychologist who pends most of her time engaged in his ghostly hobby, which makes me, suppose, the most irresponsible ixty-one-year old woman I know. OHtMNH@AbP< OO
50) 6) text: Diane starts to giggle. It’s a release and Dr. Lesh joins her.
50) 7) dialog: It isn’t over. I’m perfectly terrified. It’s all these things we don’t understand. I feel like the protohuman, stepping of the forest primeval and seeing the moon for the first time. Throwing rocks at it. 52.
50) 9) dialog: When it’s recognized for what it is. As any science. Understanding and sponsorship seem always to be one hundred years behind ridicule and doubt. Out of this experience, should we capture a high resolution photograph of a genuine manifestation Time Magazine will still put President Reagan on its next cover.
50) 13) dialog: Some people believe that when you die your soul goes to heaven.
50) 17) dialog: Some people believe that when you die there is a wonderful light. 53. DR. LESH(cont'd) As bright as the sun but it doesn’t hurt to look into it. All the answers to all the questions you want to know are inside that light. And when you walk into it... you become a part of it forever. Now, some people die, but they don’t know they’re gone.
50) 19) dialog: That’s right. Maybe they didn’t want to die. Maybe they weren’t ready. Maybe they hadn’t begun to live yet or lived a long, long time anyway, but wanted more life. They resist going into the light no matter how hard the light wants them. They hang around, watch TV, watch their friends grow up feeling all unhappy or jealous and those feelings are bad, they hurt And then some people just get lost on the way to the light. They need someone to lead them there.
50) 21) dialog: Yes. Just like in school. There are people who are nice to you. And people who are mean.
66) 2) dialog: Her eyes open and she immediately pulls out her glasses.
67) 1) dialog: (to Diane) Have you experienced this before?
67) 3) dialog: Me too. At this moment every lightbulb in the room comes on. The brightness growing to blinding levels. Everyone covers th eyes.
67) 7) dialog: Roll it back! Tak hits the rewind switch on both VTRs. Diane, Steve and Robbie all run to the display panel. 93 94 95 59.
67) 14) dialog: My God! There are hundreds.
71) 0) text: Dr. Lesh sorting through the brooches, stickpins, hail co and cameos. Brass buttons, pocket watches and cufflinks.
71) 1) dialog: This cameo. One hundred years old. Diane returns from the door and cocks her head to examine jewelry.
71) 3) dialog: And then this enigma... probably a couple years old and not your husband’ s?
71) 5) dialog: I’ve heard about jewelry or perfume disappearing from a vanity in one room later to reappear in another but... but this doesn’t fit into any construct I’ve ever experienced.
71) 7) dialog: (smiles at this) No, I suppose not. Well, I’m off. I'll take these back to the lab along with the tapes... (disturbed) ...I’11 have to display these, you know. Steve enters the kitchen.
71) 10) dialog: I’m leaving Ryan with you. Tak won’t be coming back you know?
71) 12) dialog: But he’s promised not to talk about this for several weeks. After that we’re all on our own. The front doorbell RINGS.
80) 3) dialog: In a word.
80) 5) dialog: It was the episode as it occurred.
80) 7) dialog: Oh, Tony... you too?
80) 9) dialog: Perhaps if tendrils of ectoplasm were all that showed up?
80) 11) dialog: A smoky shape lasting merely an instant.
80) 13) dialog: Nothing on tape at all... only sounds, rappings, a sigh.
80) 15) dialog: And these? What do you make of these? She gestures to the dozens of jewelry pieces on the desk. Farrow picks up a beautiful brooch. He holds it up to the light.
80) 18) dialog: You old con artist. If only you were fifty years younger.
80) 20) dialog: Okay, pops! I’m making you the accessory in this crime. She picks out a set of earrings and stuffs them into her change purse. Farrow laughs as Dr. Lesh starts to fold up napkin containing the stones and jewelry. Suddenly Farrow stops her, reaching for something in the pile.
80) 23) dialog: Yes, I picked it up myself. Why? He turns it over in his hand.
80) 25) dialog: Not something you’d wear to the masquerade ball. 72.
80) 27) dialog: (with a shiver she looks at her watch) Oh darn, I promised I’d be back before dark.
80) 29) dialog: (sourly) I was afraid you’d suggest that. Tangina’s so... melodramatic.
82) 3) dialog: I know what you’re thinking. You’1l have to take my word on this. She’s cleaned many houses. Her gifts are well documented at the parapsychology laboratory at Duke University, University of Virginia, the... Diane is becoming more and more distraught over something
82) 10) dialog: We believe it’s the heart of the house.
83) 3) dialog: Tangina, could we get on with this please? Tangina pulls out a lipstick and freshens her makeup, all while watching herself in the monitor.
83) 11) dialog: She sits down and smiles. Relieved, looks to Ryan. Ryan i filming it.
84) 54) dialog: Tell her. Go ahead, Diane. 141 112 82.
85) 0) text: Dr. Lesh, Ryan, Steven and Diane. Tangina Barrons is in t lead, outdistancing everyone. INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CHILDREN’S BEDROOM DOOR - NIGHT 112 Everybody crowds around. Tangina turns to Steve, her breathing coarse with phlegm and wheezing. 113 114 83.
92) 26) text: Dr. Lesh runs downstairs and Diane takes one look back at Steve.
93) 0) text: Dr. Lesh runs around in back of Ryan and takes hold of th taut rope. They wait without breathing. INT. CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 127 Tangina is back in her trance. Sweat beads across her bro only to be blown into horizontal rivulets by the eighty m an hour interior wind.
94) 0) text: Ryan takes his cue and pulls. Dozens of electrical discha blossom in midair and there is a primal CRY. A CRY OF BIR RYAN AND DR. LESH PULL THE ROPE.
