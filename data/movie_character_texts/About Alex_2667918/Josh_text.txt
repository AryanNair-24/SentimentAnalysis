6) 1) dialog: I had a freshman roommate named Ben, but that ass wad hasn’t called in ages. (takes in the bad news) Oh fuck. Fuck me! Well I’m not going. (listens) Because I’m not, okay? Josh hangs up and blinks his eyes silently for a moment. Suddenly possessed, he gathers up his belongings. On his out, he slams a Post-it over the NAME PLATE on his door: Office Hours Cancelled.
11) 0) text: Commuters bustle down the outdoor platform. Josh, eyes on paperback, nearly runs into Sarah.
11) 2) dialog: Sarah! They hug awkwardly. Sarah’s a bit flustered by his presen
11) 4) dialog: Yeah. Uh. You too.
11) 8) dialog: Why not?
11) 10) dialog: How do you know? When was the last time you talked to him? (OFF Sarah’s look) Okay what do you propose? We all just tiptoe around?
11) 12) dialog: In other words pretend like nothing’s wrong. That’s bullshit and he’1l smell it. Sarah’s about to respond when...
11) 14) dialog: That jerk-off boyfriend of yours still mad at me?
11) 18) dialog: (sticking it right back) When are Isaac and his lady friend getting in?
11) 23) dialog: (rubbing it in) She's 22.
11) 25) dialog: What? It’s not like she’s 12.
11) 27) dialog: Why not? Young people are incredibly comfortable with voyeurism. Let’s just hope we can compete with Bravo. Josh gets in the car. OFF Sarah, still outside, stewing.
13) 1) dialog: I’m just saying, it’s an objective truth: The Japanese are the most whacked-out people on earth. Josh and Sarah tumble in the dining room. Siri’s behind t with a BAG OF GROCERIES. Ben collects himself before join
13) 3) dialog: Come on. Cram that many people on an island and it’s like a throbbing, inbred hothouse of cultural miasma. Frankly, I’m surprised they don’t have more fetishes. (noticing Ben) Ben Ben.
13) 5) dialog: Yeah against my better fucking judgement. Josh keeps his distance. There’s a split second of tensio
13) 7) dialog: Back me up here, Ben. We’re not really going to just pretend with Alex like nothing happened, right? All the levity of their greeting quickly vanishes. 12.
13) 10) dialog: I can’t believe you're on her side.
13) 13) dialog: What? Like... set up a monitoring system?
13) 15) dialog: We're his friends, not the Gestapo. This is ridiculous.
13) 17) dialog: Case in point. This conversation is making Ben more and more uncomfortab
15) 0) text: Josh and Sarah, mid-argument.
15) 3) dialog: You know, you could’ve just sent an email if you wanted us to visit.
15) 12) dialog: Well he seems fine to me. Guess our work here is done. 22 15.
15) 14) dialog: Way to act normal, by the way.
16) 3) dialog: Where’s the bathroom again?
16) 10) dialog: Fuck it I’ll pee in nature. The two join Siri in getting ready to leave.
17) 1) dialog: You clearly have no idea what you're doing.
17) 3) dialog: Here. Josh splits a sliver off cleanly with a ferocious blow.
17) 5) dialog: Uh uh.
17) 7) dialog: I taught you all of Calc 21 and then you did better than me on the final. I’m not teaching you how to chop wood.
17) 9) dialog: Hey. I can perform just fine.
17) 11) dialog: I got it.
17) 13) dialog: I said, I got it. Josh raises the axe and delivers another blow.
19) 7) dialog: What the fuck are those?
19) 9) dialog: They're shiny and pointy.
19) 13) dialog: Too late.
19) 15) dialog: Upstairs! Isaac gives them a strange look. Sarah enters. Hesitates second when she sees Isaac.
20) 6) dialog: Not all of us can stand astride the planet on the backs of hedge funds.
20) 8) dialog: I’m just saying, we graduated at the onset of the worst recession in eighty years. History says most of us will never regain the income levels we might have otherwise enjoyed. Isaac here is a beautiful anomaly and for that we salute him.
20) 10) dialog: What’s that supposed to mean?
20) 12) dialog: But it had subtext.
20) 14) dialog: Of course I want the subtext. 29
20) 16) dialog: It’s comments like those that make me despair.
20) 18) dialog: I'm writing about the future of biography. How our ever-expanding digital footprint -- emails, texts, tweets, what have you -- will inform our “understanding of history and ourselves.”
20) 21) dialog: Because I hate the modern world.
20) 23) dialog: Honey. The only thing I hate more than the present is nostalgia for the past. The former roommates trade uncomfortable looks.
21) 0) text: Ben does dishes. Isaac dries. Alex and Josh lounge.
21) 3) dialog: It’s okay. He’s compensating for the fact that he can’t chop wood.
21) 5) dialog: Around the same time you traded in for those shoes.
21) 7) dialog: Maybe you should commit suicide. (OFF the others’ looks) What? Too soon?
22) 5) dialog: Is tonight in it?
22) 7) dialog: Tonight seems like it should definitely be in it.
22) 14) dialog: You know what? We should stage a dramatic reading.
22) 16) dialog: Why not? You can play the protagonist. I’1l be the roommate.
22) 18) dialog: Jesus can you stop with the photos?
22) 20) dialog: By ruining it in the present?
22) 23) dialog: What are you gonna do? Put ‘em on facebook?
22) 25) dialog: You're clinically obsessed.
22) 27) dialog: So your News Feed tells you Isaac is enjoying a Merlot in Napa, or Ben wrote a funny headline for the Post, and you think that means you still know someone?
22) 30) dialog: Sorry but I’d rather be in the fucking dark about what people are up to than mistake some false level of intimacy for friendship. 28. Josh's words hang uncomfortably in the air.
22) 32) dialog: Isaac’s on his Blackberry sending work emails to San Francisco.
22) 39) dialog: Uncultured.
22) 47) dialog: Already? Hey it is just like college! Ben begs him, “not now,” with his eyes before leaving.
22) 50) dialog: Why?
22) 52) dialog: You'd wish them eternal unhappiness in exchange for a cover band.
22) 54) dialog: The institution of marriage is inherently unhappy.
23) 0) text: Kate’s fallen asleep next to Isaac on the couch. Sarah, A and Josh sit across from them, overtired and slaphappy.
26) 0) text: Josh sits alone, rolling a joint. Lights it.
27) 0) text: Sarah exits the bathroom and stumbles into Josh.
27) 2) dialog: Sorry. I was just... Josh tries not to look at Sarah’s breasts.
27) 4) dialog: I was... watching Real Housewives of Atlanta the other week and--
27) 6) dialog: I was! It was on, I was there, I couldn’t look away, and then I thought, “This show, it’s really about the human condition and--
27) 20) dialog: Maybe because you want it too.
27) 22) dialog: Are Ben and Siri acting weird, or is it just me?
27) 24) dialog: Do you think they heard us?
27) 26) dialog: She always was a light sleeper.
27) 28) dialog: You know just how she'd wear those dorky orange ear plugs and still complain about the church bells waking her up every morning and--
27) 30) dialog: Why just because she’s gorgeous and smart and has the most symmetrical face known to man? And Ben gets everything he’s ever wanted in life and I get--
27) 32) dialog: Wanna go again?
27) 34) dialog: All guys are dicks. We’re hard- wired that way. It’s a simple matter of natural selection.
27) 36) dialog: Yeah yeah you’re right. So you want to go again? Sarah shakes her head at his temerity. They go at it agai
30) 0) text: Sarah slips out of Josh’s room and tiptoes down the stair
33) 13) dialog: Wait. I can use that. Josh grabs a piece of toast and uses it to wipe Isaac’s n 44.
34) 0) text: Josh nurses his coffee. Ben walks in, looking defeated. J Josh at the balcony.
34) 1) dialog: About time, you lazy bum.
34) 3) dialog: How’s Siri?
34) 5) dialog: Huh. They catch sight of Siri and Alex approaching the house.
34) 7) dialog: Fascinating.
36) 0) text: Josh runs into Siri, who’s performing sun salutations. He lights a cigarette and gestures towards some flowers.
36) 1) dialog: Early for these guys to be in bloom. 53 46.
36) 3) dialog: Just an avid student of climate change. Did you know they’re using Thoreau’s diaries to measure the effects? In 15 years you'll be able to plant mangos here. I’m just waiting for the right moment to buy up vast tracts of Canadian wilderness and then-- Josh trails off. Siri looks up at him from her downward d
36) 5) dialog: Nothing.
37) 2) dialog: And then you'd have everything you need to start your own cult. Wouldn’t that be something?
37) 4) dialog: You guys remember Michael?
37) 6) dialog: Guess how much he made when facebook went public?
37) 8) dialog: 60 million dollars. Isaac whistles. 48.
37) 9) dialog: How much do you make?
37) 11) dialog: Come on. I think we’re past politeness.
37) 15) dialog: You can always give some to me.
37) 18) dialog: Their hair.
37) 21) dialog: Maybe we should propose an elaborate swap.
37) 24) dialog: No they’re not. Alex gets sweet, nubile Kate, Isaac gets Sarah, and I get Siri because, well, she’s all that’s left. Oh and Ben gets to be published in The New Yorker.
37) 27) dialog: A dog, Sherlock. They all look around. Sure enough, a dog appears, looking disoriented. Alex kneels and checks for a collar.
37) 29) dialog: Hello! Anybody lose a dog? His yells are met by silence. The dog looks up expectantl
37) 35) dialog: I just felt a drop. It’s gonna start pouring. 55 56 50.
37) 38) dialog: Yeah and that poor person should have made more money if he was planning on getting sick. Don’t tell me you’ve turned Republican on us too.
39) 1) dialog: Is it because you grew up poor?
39) 3) dialog: Is it because your family was poor?
39) 5) dialog: I don’t know. Kind of like, “I worked hard to feed and clothe myself. Why can’t other people? Why can’t the dog?”
39) 7) dialog: No one is self-made.
39) 9) dialog: What about your roots? Wasn’t your dad in like an auto workers’ union?
39) 11) dialog: I’m just saying--
41) 3) dialog: Isaac's a Republican.
41) 15) dialog: You heard the man. He’s fucking fine! No one finds this particularly funny.
41) 21) dialog: Sweet nectar and ambrosia!
42) 5) dialog: I love young urban professionals. You always have the freshest, most organic food. And your liberal guilt makes you incapable of withholding it from me. More laughter.
42) 10) dialog: Why not? You guys even have that little back yard. Everyone looks to Siri. She looks to Ben for help but doe get any. She gets progressively more worked up as she struggles to answer the question.
42) 17) dialog: What? It’s like a magic appetizer that makes everything that follows taste that much better.
43) 0) text: A fire crackles. Isaac makes a cocktail while Ben combs through a stack of LPs. Holds up Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska. Josh groans.
43) 2) dialog: It’s like we're gripped by this never-ending nostalgia for our parents’ music. It’s oppressive.
43) 4) dialog: I’m just saying, it’s unhealthy for any generation to agree so thoroughly with its parents that its own music sucks. Ben digs around. Holds up Arcade Fire’s Neon Bible instea JOSH (CONT’D) Arcade Fire? 61 58.
43) 6) dialog: Too Canadian. But who knows... Josh lights his joint. Inhales deeply. Exhales. JOSH (CONT’D) Maybe it fits our post-modern profile for a Canadian band to best express American anxiety in its gradual post-empire period of decline. He offers the joint to Kate.
43) 8) dialog: It wont bite. Kate accepts Josh’s gift. Inhales. Coughs. Offers it to S but she refuses. Ben notices. Odd.
43) 9) dialog: Jesus what is wrong with everybody? I mean. If now isn’t a time to get fucked up, I don’t know when is. Josh hands Ben the joint and selects a record. JOSH (CONT’D) Fuck it. Let’s dance.
44) 8) dialog: Isaac! Get your anti-government ass in here! Isaac holds Sarah's gaze for another second. Then retreat
45) 0) text: The music still blares. People dance stupidly. Josh rolls another joint. Everyone helps themselves to more drugs an alcohol except for Siri, who again refuses. OFF Ben, studying her.
48) 2) dialog: What?
48) 6) dialog: We're barely high. We notice Kate licking the remains of her watermelon soup
48) 7) dialog: Okay. Some of us might be... Kate looks up apologetically.
48) 11) dialog: Why didn’t we do more drugs in college?
48) 13) dialog: I figure I’d be much less curious now if I’d only done a better job getting it out of my system back then. As it stands, I’m stunted.
48) 16) dialog: What happened to us? 63.
48) 23) dialog: Costner was in The Big Chill?
48) 32) dialog: Because that’s how people relate to each other these days. We don’t talk about things. We reference them. Like, “How was your weekend?” “It was good. (MORE )
48) 34) dialog: Kind of like Wedding Crashers meets The Beach." Or “I feel just like Rachel when she found out Ross was marrying that British girl.”
48) 36) dialog: You know what? That’s not the fucking point.
48) 46) dialog: I’m on the edge of my seat.
48) 49) dialog: I’m sure she'll do great.
48) 55) dialog: (reaching into his pocket) I’ve got some Klonopin right here.
48) 57) dialog: Well Klonopin lasts longer!
48) 65) dialog: Well, that’s disputed. Isaac helps Kate swallow the pills.
49) 2) dialog: What a nutter.
49) 4) dialog: Since when have you become her advocate?
49) 6) dialog: Don’t worry. We’ll tell you you're crazy to your face. Sarah swats Josh with a dish towel.
50) 2) dialog: Oh, you know. Now and then I score some from friends who are really fucked up. They’re like, “I’m so fucked up, I don’t know what to do with all these meds.” So I help them out.
50) 4) dialog: Medication is wasted on the sick. Besides, it’s only for when I’m wondering whether I’m wasting my life on a dissertation no one in their right mind will ever read. Sarah digs into her purse and produces a stack of index cards.
50) 12) dialog: Playing an imbecilic game.
50) 16) dialog: Before you speak you must turn to the person on your left and introduce yourself, then hug. (to Isaac) You're fucking kidding me.
50) 18) dialog: You didn’t either. Sarah turns to Isaac and Josh turns to Ben. Awkwardness ensues.
50) 19) dialog: Hi, my name is Sarah. It’s Hi, I’m Josh. This game is great to meet you. slowly making me stupider. The two pairs hug gingerly. Josh scribbles furiously, pat his head and rubs his stomach, lays a card. Ben picks it and looks to Alex.
50) 23) dialog: (to Sarah) You can’t do that. You played out of turn.
50) 25) dialog: But that’s violating the game's underlying architecture of taking turns laying cards.
50) 27) dialog: Neither did you! Neither the fuck did you!
50) 29) dialog: Okay. I get sadness, I get depression, I get anxiety. I’m pretty sure I’m experiencing at least one of them at all times. But I don’t understand suicide because I’ve never once been not absolutely terrified of death.
50) 31) dialog: Why not? We’ve been dancing around the main point of this trip all weekend. I mean, Christ! No one will even talk about the downstairs bathroom and why we’re not using it. So let’s open that door. Literally, metaphorically. Pardon the pun.
50) 33) dialog: No. Alex should give it to us straight. Tell us how good a job we all did in bucking him up when he was down. How we noticed his increasingly erratic Tweets and status updates and thought enough to do something about it. How this group meant something more than our own entertainment back in college. How it still means something now. Sarah jumps up and leaves the room, MUFFLING A SOB. Alex hesitates and Isaac looks up. Ben’s become white as a she
50) 34) dialog: Let her go. She’1l be okay.
50) 36) dialog: I’m a truth teller.
50) 38) dialog: What was it? Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man? Lot of ambiguity in that one.
50) 40) dialog: That’s my fucking point! Where the hell were any of us? 72.
50) 60) dialog: Hey. She doesn’t respond. Josh lies down next to her.
50) 61) dialog: I’m sorry. Sometimes things need to get said. And in those instances being an asshole comes in handy. They lie in silence. Josh kisses Sarah’s shoulder, her ne
50) 64) dialog: What? All that talk about death? Tell me you don’t want to.
50) 66) dialog: Sarah. Come on. Josh sits on the edge of the bed. Sarah’s fighting a losi battle against her composure.
50) 68) dialog: I was 20.
50) 70) dialog: My dad was leaving my mom.
50) 72) dialog: I was just so... angry. At him. At Ben. At everyone. 70 71 75.
57) 0) text: Josh appears. Joins Ben and lights a cigarette.
57) 2) dialog: Attempting to have sex with Sarah. 82.
57) 4) dialog: Thanks. They stand for a moment in silence.
57) 6) dialog: So what you’re saying is you’re blocked in more ways than one.
57) 8) dialog: Maybe it’s just a phase. I hear women go through those.
57) 11) dialog: Wow. Your life sounds as fucked up as mine.
57) 13) dialog: And to think I’ve been jealous of you for seven years. Josh's honesty is cathartic. 80 83. JOSH (CONT’D) You know, as much as I’d love to derive some perverse pleasure in all this, I can’t.
58) 0) text: Ben and Josh amble inside and find Sarah, sitting with th dog on the couch.
58) 1) dialog: Looks like someone made a friend.
60) 0) text: A moonlit driveway. Ben brushes by a confused Josh. Alex the first to catch up with him. He grabs his shoulder and spins him around.
66) 0) text: Josh enters with the dog on a MAKESHIFT LEASH and finds I and Siri. Isaac looks at him funny.
66) 1) dialog: What? Sarah appears. She and Isaac both reach for the coffee machine at the some moment, then retreat. It’s awkward.
66) 2) dialog: Will someone please tell me what the hell is going on? Alex and Kate walk in. Alex avoids eye contact with Siri he pours himself coffee.
66) 4) dialog: Mine was already fucked. So don’t mention it. 98 90.
68) 25) dialog: He’s just blowing off some steam.
68) 27) dialog: He’1ll get past it. Siri doesn’t buy it. JOSH (CONT’D) It’s ironic, though.
68) 29) dialog: I guess I always thought, if you were going to slip up, that it’d be with me.
68) 31) dialog: Sometimes your logic confuses me.
68) 33) dialog: You’ve never not looked beautiful. Siri stops fussing and looks up at Josh. She’s still anxi but she smiles thankfully.
70) 4) dialog: In the shape of a tree?
72) 0) text: Josh, Sarah, Alex, and the dog all lounge on the couches. 98.
72) 3) dialog: For some reason I feel strangely okay about that. Sarah and Alex both look at Josh like he’s gone mad.
72) 4) dialog: What? Maybe I’m turning over a new leaf!
72) 8) dialog: I'd consider it. They hear the SOUND OF ROLLING SUITCASES and turn to see Isaac and Kate enter from the mud room.
72) 9) dialog: Going so soon?
72) 11) dialog: Lemme see if I can rustle up Ben and Siri... As Josh exits, Isaac hugs Alex.
73) 4) dialog: What investment?
73) 8) dialog: Jesus, Sarah. Take the money before he gets an even worse idea about what to do with it. Sarah smiles. Josh looks at Ben.
73) 9) dialog: Hey. Where’s your stuff?
73) 13) dialog: Wait. Staying was an option? Everyone smiles.
73) 14) dialog: I’m serious! Anyone else got any secrets they want to share?
73) 16) dialog: Jesus. I thought we talked about this.
74) 0) text: Lots of excited noise and bustling. Ben, Siri, Josh, Sara Isaac, and Alex are all there, but their hair is differen and they look younger. Alex stands alone, holding a tray of food and scanning th sea of tables uncertainly. Ben approaches him.
74) 5) dialog: Yo. Don Quixote. I send you on a mission for ketchup. You come back with a lost boy. What the fuck. But Ben has noticed Siri.
74) 7) dialog: (impatiently) Siri, Ben. Ben, Siri. Ben holds Siri’s gaze as they shake hands.
74) 9) dialog: Jesus. You know the food will still be here when we come back for breakfast, right?
75) 5) dialog: Next time we see each other, let’s shoot for a happier occasion.
