24) 0) text: Alex and Sarah brush their teeth, jockeying for space.
26) 2) dialog: It’s funny. All of us breathing under the same roof again. Do you ever wish we could just go back?
26) 4) dialog: Why not?
26) 6) dialog: Of what?
26) 8) dialog: That’s ridiculous.
26) 10) dialog: Alex, I don’t know how to say this but have you thought about therapy? ‘Cause I’ve done it a lot and--

50) 67) dialog: Instead of being the guy who permanently fucked up my expectations for normalcy in a relationship. The guy who made me explain to my mom that no, Josh isn't exactly my boyfriend. He’s more like someone who sleeps with me when he comes home pining for my best friend and too drunk to see straight. Josh gets up and walks towards her as he speaks.
50) 69) dialog: So was I.
50) 71) dialog: Is that your excuse?

56) 18) dialog: Isaac. Come on.
56) 20) dialog: I did! I do. I mean... for a long time, I did.
56) 22) dialog: But you don’t want this. Your shy, nineteen-year-old self does. You want closure. You want to express your anxieties about how this thing with Kate might be real. Because I think it is real, and I think you think it could be real. (a beat) You want all those things, but not me. Not really, at least. That’s why. Isaac processes this. As if on cue, THEY HEAR FOOTSTEPS a turn to see Kate entering from the dining room. Isaac attempts to shift gears quickly.
