0) 0) text: Nora waits for a shirt to come out of a 3D printer. It’s future, guys.
0) 1) dialog: Hey thanks for the bottle of water. It’s the little touches get you 5 stars. She shows him she rated him 5 stars on her version of Nit (which is like a Tinder/Uber hybrid.)
0) 3) dialog: I really don’t. Maybe if we get matched up again.
0) 5) dialog: ... Really, dude?
0) 8) dialog: No, you know what? Fuck this. I‘1l take the two.
0) 10) dialog: Wow. Okay then, I’1l earn it. She grabs the shirt and heaves the printer in the air, leaving as Byron scrambles to catch it. INT. HALL OUTSIDE BYRON’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Pulling on her shirt, Nora hears a CRASH and smiles. Her phone dings and she sees a screen: “You have received a 0 star rating on your last Nitely experience. Would you lik to contest, y/n?” She scowls.
2) 0) text: Nora walks down the crowded sidewalk. Drones fly overhead like pigeons. The street is crammed with bikes, one of wh bangs into Nora.
2) 1) dialog: Ow! Fucking bikes!
3) 0) text: Nora hurries past protesters, holding signs like “Digital Afterlife is an Abomination to God!”
3) 2) dialog: Fucking Ludds.
4) 0) text: Employees touch their index finger to a screen and are allowed to enter. Nora gives the middle finger to the scr then uses it to log in. She walks under a sign reading: “Amazon Lakeview Customer Service.”
8) 15) dialog: Cool! Thanks so much, Lucy! Merry Winterday! She turns to her screen covered with folders and opens on labelled “Rechna Futawarab.” Inside is an avatar of a MID AGED INDIAN WOMAN next to a million video files and an al “rendering complete: activate?” Nora hits a key and a win opens with a jiggling brain wave and an upload circle tha starts filling up.
8) 16) dialog: (into her headset) Hello, Rechna. (MORE )
8) 19) dialog: It’s all good, Rechna. Welcome to Heaven.
11) 14) dialog: Nope. She opens another memory file. Nathan's POV: the Pacific Coast Highway over the top of motorcycle handlebars, ocean on the left. Nathan looks in the side mirror and grins, the wind whipping his hair. Nora pauses the picture of Nathan checking his look in th mirror again. This guy just loves himself, doesn't he? Sh drags the image to the wire-frame avatar, which gets more detailed and high-res.
11) 16) dialog: He sure thinks he’s cute. Basic Beverly Hills douche. App start- up? Vintage motorcycle? Come on.
11) 18) dialog: (looks at file) Car accident.
11) 20) dialog: It says car.
13) 7) dialog: Hello, Nathan. I’m not expecting you to answer me yet, the system is sorting through a lot of information, but I’m going to count to three, and try to count with me. One... two... three... INT. NORA’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Nora looks at a wave form of Nathan’s consciousness. Next it is a circle that is slowly filling up. (Another window scrolls through the millions of video files and photos. I complicated and cool as shit.)
13) 8) dialog: Welcome to Heaven, Nathan.
13) 10) dialog: You made it to Lakeview, you lucky duck.
13) 12) dialog: Hang in there, dude. 20. INT. NORA’S WORKSTATION —- CONTINUOUS Nora’s screen has Nathan’s brainwaves playing in a window
13) 13) dialog: I want you to think of your self. The “I” in the sentence, “I think therefore I am.” Okay, cool, just gonna grab that... She highlights a section of his waveform with her cursor.
13) 14) dialog: That’1l be your password, or passthought. I’11 always be able to use this to--
13) 16) dialog: recognize you. Now, remember kindergarten? The alphabet song, A BCD? Think that for me... Yeah, good. Now think the color blue... white... red... yellow. Perfect. The darkness goes blue, then white, then red, then yellow then starts resolving slowly into a scene. INT. NORA’S WORKSTATION —- CONTINUOUS Nora looks at the screen.
13) 18) dialog: (laughs ) Why do people always set it for Australian accent? Say again please. She adjusts some stuff on the screen.
13) 20) dialog: There we go. That’s a lot better voice for you. 21.
13) 22) dialog: Pins and needles is just the program finding your nerve endings. Can you see anything? INT. AMAZON LAKEVIEW — CONTINUOUS The place is booting up -- a rectangle becomes a window. Details emerge: a wooden rocking chair, a crocheted cushi porcelain door knobs. Out the window, brilliant blue sky, dark green fir trees on a distant mountain.
13) 26) dialog: What?! That’s not supposed to--
13) 29) dialog: 
13) 30) dialog: (a little impressed) Ha! Sense of humor. Nice. Um, so, welcome to Amazon's Lakeview. The only digital afterlife environment modeled on the grand Victorian hotels of the United States and Canada. 22. Nathan looks around the room -- a big, luxurious, hotel s with a stuffed moose head and handmade wooden chairs with bark still on.
13) 31) dialog: Hope it’s not too specific for you.
13) 33) dialog: Yeah, our design team is brilliant. They took for inspiration the vacation spots of the Gilded Age millionaires, with a little Gatsby and Niagara Falls thrown in for fun. Timeless Americana, uplifting views, healthy pursuits. Good stuff.
13) 35) dialog: What?! This is a design scheme, one, and that’s not even the right period, two. Lakeview is open to all races, religions, genders, absolutely anybody. I see you selected “non-denominational charismatic Christian” as your creed. That means, for you, the little chapel east of the hotel will be a Pentecostal Church. For someone else, the same building could be a mosque or even a bowling alley.
13) 37) dialog: I can make that change if you give me your Amazon ID.
13) 39) dialog: (typing) Your first dog and the street you grew up -- you used your porn name for an Amazon ID? Pretty poor security for a coder.
13) 41) dialog: Didn't work. Your charges are going to an Ingrid Kannerman.
13) 43) dialog: There’re lots of free activities. Swim in the lake, hike up to a gazebo, take a class. Nathan’s face suddenly screws up and he chokes back tears
13) 44) dialog: Uh oh. Dude, you okay?
13) 46) dialog: Don’t be embarrassed. It must be really hard. To die, I mean. Especially when you’re young, and handss - um, healthy. And remember, they saved your body so who knows? Maybe one day they figure out how to put you back in. Nora watches with compassion as Nathan sucks it back up a composes himself.
13) 48) dialog: Well, you’re supposed to just refer to me as your “Angel.”
13) 50) dialog: I’m not allowed to say. Sorry. But anytime you need me I’1l be here for you. Just ask and I'll be right in your ear.
13) 52) dialog: (back on script) So you’re all connected now. Do you look real to yourself? Ten fingers and toes? He wiggles them.
13) 54) dialog: Explore, enjoy, meet your fellow Uploads. This is the first day of the rest of your afterlife.
13) 56) dialog: (gently) Hey, this was a big day. You died and were reborn, so a lot to process.
13) 58) dialog: Tomorrow’ll be better, you’ll see. Get some rest. 25.
15) 31) text: Nora in a graduation gown between her smiling parents. INT. DAVE ANTONY’S HOUSE - CITY ISLAND - EVENING - CONTIN Nora looks at the photo wistfully. In the background, her Dad, DAVE, is in his kitchen. 32.
15) 33) dialog: Speaking of work, Dad...
15) 35) dialog: We've had a ton of upgrades lately. With my employee discount, it’d be smart to lock in such a good deal-- Dave stifles a coughing fit. Nora looks on, concerned.
15) 36) dialog: Dad... After his coughs subside--
15) 38) dialog: I could be your angel, we could hang out--
15) 40) dialog: C'mon! You don’t believe that old stuff!
15) 42) dialog: I think your fat cartridge might be low.
17) 3) dialog: Be my guest. I am so done with that app. Well, almost done. Mandi snaps the fitband on her wrist and opens her thumb finger, making the screen appear. She swipes through Nite looking at profiles. 36.
17) 5) dialog: I thought you said the algorithm was good.
17) 7) dialog: Oh Mandi.
19) 12) dialog: Mysterious?
19) 14) dialog: They don’t just sleep on icebergs and yawn all the time?
19) 16) dialog: Well maybe they’re just down there intimidating the other sea creatures with their big winkies.
21) 0) text: Nora gets out of the elevator with her messenger bag. The schlubby male angel, IVAN, is getting on to leave.
21) 2) dialog: Yeah, no that’s not for me.
21) 4) dialog: I go out plenty. Just not gonna be tripping with you in some loft. I’m not there yet.
22) 0) text: Nora is in a stall, sitting on the toilet and looking at memes on her hand-screen. 42.
22) 3) dialog: Shit. Thanks!
23) 0) text: Nora runs to her desk and grabs her VR mask. She glances her screen.
23) 1) dialog: Shit shit.
24) 0) text: Nathan walks towards the waterfall, passing signs “Data torrent ahead. Do not approach.” and “Avatars, AIs, Uploa go no further. The data torrent will deliminate you into undifferentiated data bits.” Nora appears behind him.
24) 1) dialog: Hey, Nathan, wait up! He recognizes her voice.
24) 3) dialog: So maybe not the best first day.
24) 5) dialog: It’s supposed to be Heaven.
24) 7) dialog: Well, maybe not for you, but if you were stuck in an elevator with another guest...
24) 9) dialog: You realize if you jump into that thing, you don’t go anywhere, you just disappear. And there’s nothing left to rescan.
24) 11) dialog: Oo-oh. So you agree with Neil Beagley.
24) 13) dialog: He was a 16 year old boy who died of a uti ‘cause he refused medical treatment for religious reasons. Or the parents of Wesley Parker who let him die age 11 while they sang hymns instead of giving him insulin. You agree with them?
24) 15) dialog: Exactly.
24) 18) dialog: What was the first thing I asked you to think of?
24) 20) dialog: No, your self. I think therefore I am. That is still you, it has always been you, it will always be you as long as it can still be aware of itself. That’s consciousness and that’s what we’re in the business of keeping going. Why do you think it’s sometimes weird and unnatural here? Because your consciousness is thinking and comparing with your memories -- that’s you, baby. Doing what you you always did. Thinking and being alive. And I’m sure there are plenty of people, including me for one, that are glad you're still here.
24) 22) dialog: Not yet. But I’d like to. And I get this isn’t perfect, and maybe you were led to believe it would be since the marketing mentions Heaven like a dozen times, but it’s kind of better isn’t it? Maybe the imperfections make it more like Life, ‘cause Life isn’t perfect, but Life is the most magical gift there is. If there’s God, he’s amazing because he gave us Life, and the gratitude and creativity to keep it going as long as we possibly can.
24) 24) dialog: Yeah. 45.
24) 26) dialog: Maybe.
24) 28) dialog: This is me. (suddenly self conscious) I mean, my avatar has make-up on and my hair is nice, and I’m not in sweatpants, so it’s a little better than normal, but nothing else is tweaked.
24) 31) dialog: No. I could get in trouble. It’s a policy.
24) 33) dialog: My name is Nora. I live in Ozone Park, Queens. My apartment’s about as big as your bathroom, but I’m at work now which is in Dumbo, Brooklyn. (MORE )
24) 35) dialog: It’s a really humid day and the bitch a couple desks down is taking forever to eat a tuna sandwich that I’m considering chucking out the window. Nora Antony.
24) 37) dialog: Likewise. Can we go home now?
24) 39) dialog: What’s your favorite smell?
24) 42) dialog: Smell it. He takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and smiles.
