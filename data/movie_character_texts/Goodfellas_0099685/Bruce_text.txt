46) 0) text: We see Henry walk down driveway to the back yard area where BRUCE and two of his brothers are talking. Bruce sees Henry and walks toward him. Bruce's two brothers are smirking.
46) 1) dialog: What do you want? They get close.
46) 2) dialog: (annoyed and menacing) Hey! Fucko! You want something? With absolutely no warning, Henry reaches out and grabs Bruce's hair with one hand and pulls his gun out of his waistband with the other. In almost one motion, Henry smashes the gun across Bruce's face. Teeth fall from Bruce's mouth. The two brothers, still not seeing the gun, start toward Henry, but Henry continues to pound the gun into Bruce's face like a dinner gong. Bruce's head is still off the ground only because Henry refuses to let go of his hair. Bruce's brothers realize Henry has a gun. They freeze and back off.
