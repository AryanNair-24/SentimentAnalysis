10) 7) dialog: Cops don’t wander. Pets wander. Ward, you wanna ride with a dog, work K9. They laugh in that stupid, self congratulatory way racist always do. Ward about to explode... POLLARD (CONT’D) If I get smoked, gentlemen. Let the asshole go.
11) 6) dialog: Shotguns and radios? When do we get the graham crackers and apple juice? 15.
24) 0) text: Pollard, the dick cop from earlier, Hicks and Ward all st at the wand on the kitchen table. Sergeant Ching enters..

24) 11) dialog: So what are we gonna do about this?
24) 14) dialog: Nope. Pollard, Sgt. Ching and Hicks exchange looks. Ward beginn to clock something’s wrong.
24) 16) dialog: Wands royally fuck up radio reception. Dispatch never heard you. We did ‘cause we were close by. But the Department knows fuck all about the wand. If they did the whole world would be here. The wand doesn’t exist. The wand was never here. (finally...) We're taking the wand.
24) 18) dialog: Don’t worry. I know people who know people.

25) 0) text: Two more cop cars outside. The little elf girl sits on Pollard’s hood, her purple eyes stare through long white blond hair hanging down over pale skin. Wrapped in a blanket, Jakoby comforts her in halting, imperfect Elvish
26) 3) dialog: He’s fine. Let him catch up to it.
26) 6) dialog: Fuck this. Ward, lemme reframe this. Want your little girl to not have a father AND Jakoby dies? Or just Jakoby dies? Because you’re in fuckin fantasy land if you think you're walking outta here with life as you know it intact.
26) 9) dialog: Who means more to you? Your little girl or your pet monster? We're leaving with the wand. You wanna go home tonight? The orc dies either way. End of story. There’s a brutal silence. We hear the flies buzzing. The whine of the old light bulbs. Hicks is smooth as Satan...
26) 14) dialog: We got people coming to help. People who know how to fix things. This will work out good for you. Pollard puts a brotherly arm around Ward...

Everything she does i weighted with thought, meaning and intent, down to the smallest movement. She steps over the bodies of Sergeant Ching and Hicks. Behind her are SLASHER and COWBOY, with carbines and body armor. They have that Special Forces vibe, a couple hundr confirmed kills between them. Gibson stepping, Pollard slumps with relief...
