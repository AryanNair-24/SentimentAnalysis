6) 11) text: He HIGHLIGHTS the item about Curtis Zampf...
10) 21) text: They exchange looks: how did he know about Curtis?
10) 23) dialog: ...Where I grew up in South Boston twenty years ago, when a kid walked down the street, everyone knew who he was...
11) 2) text: CURTIS ZAMPF is addressing a dozen or so guests. He is 40 but appears younger; with rough good looks, longish hair a leather jacket, he seems more like an aging rock star o sexy novelist that a standard-issue American Nazi.
11) 4) dialog: ...If he ran out in front of a car, some old Mick'd yell at him, "Jimmy Dunne, get back on that sidewalk and stay there...."
11) 7) dialog: ...The day he graduated high school, he'd go see his uncle down at the gas works, or the priest's brother in the shipyard, get his apprentice papers, eight years later he'd be making $16.50 an hour, have four kids, play ball on Sundays in Columbus Park, and when he died, the whole town'd get drunk and cry over him....
11) 11) dialog: ...Today, when that kid walks down the street it's full of trash and half the faces are black. The shipyard's closed, all the jobs at the gas works are set-asides, and by the time he drops out of school, he can barely get a job at Burger King. So he drinks, smokes crack, and when he hangs himself on the front porch at twenty-three, the only people at his wake are a couple of buddies and his mother. The boy's father won't find out he's dead till six months later. (beat) The soul of this country is being destroyed, and all the government can offer is free trade, mutual funds and IPOs.
11) 15) dialog: I used to be one.... No, seriously, I called myself an anarchist. I stood up for the oppressed. I opposed state power.
11) 19) dialog: I oppose the present state because it's weak. It has been ever since the left emasculated it over Vietnam. But I think the average man is crushed less by accumulated capital than the loss of community or real leadership, the personal emptiness he simply cannot fill on his own.... (matter-of-fact) That's why I'm a fascist. It's the only form of government that addresses our deepest needs.
11) 20) text: Silence. Danny -- who has spotted Carla -- begins to clap few others join in. Danny raises his hand; Curtis nods to him....
11) 25) dialog: More cultural than political.
11) 29) dialog: Decentralized, nonviolent, increasingly mainstream. We'll see antiabortion, anti-immigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby, Christian identity types, tax resisters and even some libertarians....
11) 35) dialog: This isn't the time for that.
11) 66) dialog: That would be a catastrophic mistake.
11) 70) dialog: They used to. Today it's not an issue.
11) 97) dialog: You wouldn't announce it?
11) 101) dialog: But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
11) 109) dialog: Okay, let's break this up for now.... (to Danny) Could you wait a minute...?
12) 2) text: ACROSS THE ROOM -- MRS. MOEBIUS &amp; CURTIS ZAMPF
12) 4) dialog: (low) ...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
12) 8) dialog: Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
12) 12) dialog: Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues...
12) 17) dialog: He speaks well. But what do we do with him?
12) 21) dialog: You mean who he really is.
12) 33) text: He turns. She's beckoning to him. He gives Carla a look, then crosses to her, sitting in a chair she indicates. Curtis offers him a drink; he declines. Carla takes one.
12) 65) dialog: (to Lina, explaining) An investment banking house.
12) 71) dialog: How would you kill him?
12) 81) text: As Curtis leads him toward the door, Danny looks around f Carla, hears WOMEN'S VOICES arguing in German. Frustrated he goes down the stairs....
20) 4) text: Curtis now sees Danny. A look between them. Danny goes ou
47) 1) text: Danny sees Carla sitting on a green sofa wearing a white sundress and leafing through a magazine. Curtis is mixing drinks. Lina is practicing with her stylus on a new electronic organizer.
47) 5) dialog: (spots Danny) The prisoner returns....
48) 1) text: Danny talking with Lina and Curtis but watching Carla.
48) 3) dialog: ...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
48) 7) dialog: I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
48) 10) text: Curtis rolls his eyes. Lina signals him to lay off.
48) 18) text: Carla puts down her magazine, goes out to the kitchen. Danny's eyes follow her, and Curtis's follow his.
48) 26) dialog: An urban type.
48) 30) text: He starts: who could be calling him here? As he goes into the kitchen to take the phone, Curtis says quietly...
48) 32) dialog: He's mad, Lina, you know that.
55) 1) text: Carla sits on the bed, straddling Curtis, who lies beneat her. She is looking right at Danny. Curtis, unaware of hi keeps thrusting into her from below.
55) 2) text: Danny starts to leave, but on second thought stays. Carla stares expressionless, yet more attentive to him than to Curtis. Indeed, their eyes never leave each other, so tha when she becomes aroused, we understand that it is Danny is responding to, Danny she is really making love to.
56) 1) text: Danny reading. A KNOCK at the door. He looks up, Curtis comes in. Danny stiffens at the sight of him, but Curtis friendly.
56) 3) dialog: What are you reading?
56) 6) dialog: Leo Strauss... (nods approvingly) I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
56) 10) dialog: They left an hour ago. (off Danny's disappointment) You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on. (off Danny's silence) How soon can you get back to the city?
56) 14) dialog: What's that? (off Danny's silence) Okay. Surprise us...
70) 1) text: Danny alone, waiting, nervous. He hears FOOTSTEPS approac he touches the gun in the back of his trousers. Lina and Curtis enter.
70) 8) text: Danny is relieved and intrigued. Lina nods at Curtis to g
70) 10) dialog: We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like The Bell Curve, Sociobiology, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
70) 23) dialog: That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
70) 28) dialog: Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
88) 4) text: General confusion. Mrs. Moebius and Curtis exchange wary glances.
90) 1) text: Carla watching a small TV on the kitchen counter. Danny arrives, followed by Lina and Curtis as we hear...
90) 17) text: She and Curtis walk out of the room. Stunned, shaken, Dan leaves in a different direction. The TV plays to an empty room...
96) 1) text: Lina and Curtis with Billings and Drake, who looks bad...
96) 9) dialog: You should've gone to the police.
96) 14) text: The phone RINGS. Curtis answers, listens, covers the mout

101) 3) text: Curtis picks up a cell phone and dials.
101) 8) dialog: (into phone) Yes, I believe that a bomb is going to be planted tonight at Temple Emanu-el on 65th Street.... By the same man who killed Ilio Manzetti... His name is Daniel Balint....
