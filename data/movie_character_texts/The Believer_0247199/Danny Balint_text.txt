8) 5) text: The girls watch him, too. The skins don't like that. One them (Billings) seems ready to do something about it. The others try to calm him, and when they look back, Danny ha left. He barely touched the drink.

11) 1) text: Grand but threadbare. The skins enter: O.L. like a child, Carleton like a sardonic adolescent, Billings like a revolutionary, Danny like an uncrowned prince.
11) 20) text: Silence. Danny -- who has spotted Carla -- begins to clap few others join in. Danny raises his hand; Curtis nods to him....
11) 22) dialog: What do you think the fascism of the twenty-first century will look like?
11) 27) dialog: Obviously.
11) 38) dialog: I disagree. (glances at Carla) I think race is central to everything we're talking about. (murmurs of agreement) Spiritual life comes from race. From the blood. Without that, we're no better than the Jews....

11) 72) dialog: No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl. (around the room people nod) It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
11) 76) dialog: Prominent Jews. Who are either symbols in themselves or who represent aspects of the Jewish character people despise.
11) 81) text: Mutterings: "Who's she?" "Yeah, her..." But Danny says:

12) 55) dialog: Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.

29) 14) dialog: No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
29) 18) dialog: What about Curtis Zampf?
29) 22) dialog: I agree.
29) 26) dialog: In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
29) 30) dialog: What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
29) 34) dialog: German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
29) 37) text: Danny shifts in his seat, growing more interested....
29) 39) dialog: The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
29) 43) dialog: Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
29) 47) dialog: You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
29) 51) dialog: Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
29) 55) dialog: And? WHat did you notice?
29) 59) dialog: Jewish girls like to give head, right?
29) 63) dialog: And Jewish men like to get it.
29) 67) dialog: Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
29) 71) dialog: Because the Jew is essentially female.
29) 75) dialog: Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you? (as Guy nods) After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
29) 79) dialog: You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
29) 83) dialog: Let's just say I've done due diligence.
29) 87) dialog: The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.
29) 88) text: Danny leans over to make sure Guy's getting it right.
29) 90) dialog: Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
29) 94) dialog: Those aren't Jews.
29) 98) dialog: Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength.... (pumped; this is what he loves) Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
29) 102) dialog: Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
29) 106) text: A beat. Danny smiles at the mistake....
29) 108) dialog: What? Excuse me?... (Guy says nothing) You're kidding, right?
29) 112) dialog: Who? How would I know him?
29) 116) dialog: You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
29) 120) dialog: Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
29) 125) dialog: Do you know who you're fucking with here?
29) 129) dialog: (sputtering, unsure what to say) Listen to me....
29) 133) dialog: To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
29) 137) dialog: It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
29) 140) text: GUN: pulled from Danny's pants, slammed down on the table Guy sits back abruptly. Danny picks it up, cocks it....
29) 142) dialog: Look at me. Look at me, Guy.... Oh, now you can't look at me? Look at me, you schmuck. Look at me.... (pokes the gun in Guy's face) You print that shit in the New York Times...I'll kill myself.

33) 3) dialog: We're from New York. Curtis Zampf invited us.

33) 11) text: Steroid comes at him.... Danny steps inside the charge an goes to work on the bigger man's body. We barely see what happens, but we hear it and feel the crowd's shock. Danny stronger than we realized and much more vicious. In secon Steroid sinks to his knees, face bloody. Danny holds up h leans close:
33) 13) dialog: Enough?
33) 14) text: Steroid mumbles in the affirmative. Danny nods -- then hi him four more shots to the face. Even this crowd winces. Steroid drops with a wet thud.
33) 15) text: As Danny straightens up, wiping the blood off his hands, people instinctively step back.
33) 17) dialog: Which was his room?
33) 20) text: On the end: has an extra window. Danny walks into the roo Steroid's stuff starts flying out the door.

35) 17) dialog: What is this, Stalingrad?
35) 20) text: He grins maniacally. Danny smiles. Kyle is emboldened by Danny's unexpected friendliness, lowers his voice....
35) 24) dialog: You could do it.
35) 28) dialog: You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.

37) 15) dialog: I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
37) 19) dialog: He called me up. He wanted to talk to me about my ideas.

37) 31) dialog: Oh, really?

44) 23) dialog: What could he have done?? You fucking kikes...
44) 27) dialog: The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?

59) 3) text: Frozen, they look at each other. Kyle exhales, takes the bomb and, with Danny holding it, carefully restrings the bungee. A MECHANICAL NOISE overhead:

59) 8) text: Kyle has no idea and doesn't care. Danny scrambles out.
60) 1) text: Straightening up, Danny is stunned by a vision:

60) 31) dialog: It's not paper, it's parchment. It's made from sheepskin. And all the letters are drawn by hand.
60) 34) text: Danny nods, then, as if against his will....
60) 36) dialog: It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.

60) 47) dialog: How come you don't know it? (pressing the advantage) How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
60) 51) dialog: No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush? (obviously not) Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
60) 55) dialog: Who's Eichmann?!!?
60) 56) text: Danny's incredulous, though it's not clear how many of th others know why Eichmann was.

60) 88) text: This produces a strange effect on the others. Some (Kyle, Steroid, Drake) join in. They knock the aitz off the bema it rolls out, exposing ten feet of Torah. They stamp on i spit on it.... Others (Carleton, O.L.), though less troub than Danny, are surprised (and embarrassed) by their own revulsion at these acts.
60) 89) text: Danny watches helplessly, like the survivor who did nothi as his son was murdered.
60) 93) text: ...Danny kneels by the Torah. With a tallis, he attempts clean the parchment. Carleton and O.L. help him roll it o the aitz. [Echo "Christ taken down from cross" with Torah Christ.] They replace the cover, the yod, the crowns....

62) 20) text: ON DANNY. Sound fades. He's haunted: "Nothingness without end" was what he'd told Guy Danielsen the Jews were obses with. He seems to hear the cello playing "Kol Nidre" agai Then...
62) 22) dialog: Okay, everybody out. Get out.
64) 1) text: Danny is in the bathroom in front of the mirror, holding shirt up with his chin as he wraps the tallis around his torso. When he lowers the shirt, the fringes hang out lik the tsitsis that Orthodox men wear.

66) 1) text: Danny and Drake pass a low-slung modern synagogue. A sign announces: AMBASSADOR ILIO MANZETTI Friday, August 31. Da reacts, startled...Drake smiles.
67) 1) text: The building is lit. Within we hear an AMPLIFIED VOICE, presumably Manzetti giving a speech. We can't make out th words. Danny and Drake are hidden among the rhododendrons flanking the parking lot. Danny is watching a door in the side of the building and eating a sandwich as Drake loads scoped rifle.

67) 43) dialog: I didn't. I told you, I can't --
67) 46) text: Danny looks over his shoulder. His shirt has ridden up hi back, revealing the tallis wrapped around his waist.
67) 49) text: Drake pulls a .45 from the duffel.... Without thinking, Danny rolls over, fires the rifle. Drake is blown backwar dropping the .45.
67) 50) text: Danny leaps up.... Drake's on his hands and knees, his trousers quickly darkening with blood. Danny's upset.
67) 52) dialog: Oh, Jesus...Drake, are you okay...?
67) 53) text: FOOTSTEPS, coming this way. Danny runs. We hear voices, " down.... Stay down.... He's got a gun...." Drake picks himself up, stumbles away, bent over....
68) 1) text: Danny parks the van in an abandoned lot near the river. Quickly wiping down the wheel with his shirt, he tosses o his duffel bag and the scoped rifle. He climbs out, wipes down the door, throws the rifle into the water, grabs the duffel and hurries away.

69) 6) dialog: Sure, come on down.... Can you bring my stuff?... Thanks...and if Drake shows up, let me know right away.... Good...
70) 1) text: Danny alone, waiting, nervous. He hears FOOTSTEPS approac he touches the gun in the back of his trousers. Lina and Curtis enter.
70) 5) dialog: (how much do they know?) Fine.
70) 8) text: Danny is relieved and intrigued. Lina nods at Curtis to g
70) 12) dialog: I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
70) 16) dialog: (slapped in the face) Fund-raising??
70) 21) dialog: What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
70) 25) dialog: I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to -- (get anything done there?)
70) 31) text: Danny's watching Carla go down the hall toward the back, barely bring his attention back to the conversation at ha
70) 33) dialog: I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
70) 43) dialog: Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
70) 47) dialog: They're not that Jewish.
71) 1) text: Danny comes out of the building, squats between two parke cars and vomits, retching spastically until, gasping for breath...
72) 1) text: Carla, naked, browsing the books, sees something in the closet. It's the Torah Danny took from the synagogue. She unrolls it on the bed, her gaze moving over the mysteriou glossy script. Danny, coming out of the bathroom, sees wh she is doing, and stops short.
72) 5) dialog: I stole it. From a synagogue.
72) 10) dialog: That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
72) 14) dialog: No.
72) 18) dialog: What do you care?
72) 21) text: Danny looks at the word, then back at her. He's torn betw competing desires, but finally...
72) 23) dialog: Va-yomer... And he said. (she moves her finger to the left) It goes the other way.
72) 27) dialog: Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
72) 31) dialog: And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you....
72) 32) text: Danny remains silent a moment, affected by the passage...
72) 36) dialog: Why?
72) 40) dialog: Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
72) 45) dialog: Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
72) 49) dialog: They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
72) 53) dialog: Yeah, it's stupid. (indicating her T-shirt) Put it on, or I won't teach you.
72) 56) dialog: See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
72) 60) dialog: You can't curse in front of it either.
72) 65) dialog: Good question. Both. (draws a letter) Aleph...
72) 69) dialog: It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
72) 73) dialog: They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay... (as she repeats the names) How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
72) 77) dialog: Even though his dick is so big?
72) 81) dialog: Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
73) 1) text: Danny and Kyle.
73) 5) dialog: That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
73) 9) dialog: I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
73) 12) text: Kyle's confident, and the prospect of this really happeni gives Danny pause. He feels a brief chill, escapes it wit
73) 14) dialog: What about Drake, did he ever show up?
73) 17) text: Danny nods, gestures for Kyle to split. Kyle looks around walks away. Danny waits a moment, then heads in the oppos direction.
74) 1) text: Danny walking behind a Hasidic family (MAN, WOMAN, 3-year old BOY, STROLLER)...watching them. At a corner, the fath takes the boy's hand, and as they cross the street, the b glances back at Danny.
75) 2) text: As a soldier tries to take the BOY out of his arms, the child panics, clings to his father, screaming, "Papa... Papa..." It is the scene the survivor described in the meeting with the Nazis. But now the father is DANNY'S FATHER....
75) 7) dialog: (in German) What's the matter here?
75) 14) text: Danny/sergeant lifts the (unseen) child into the air. Its SHADOW darkens the father's face. Drops of blood run down his cheeks....
75) 15) text: Danny/sergeant stares into the father's face, enraged at man's passivity.
75) 17) dialog: Fucking kike.
76) 1) text: DANNY'S FACE -- sweating, haunted, as if he's just woken from the previous.
77) 8) dialog: Shlomo?
77) 11) text: Danny puts down the book, trying to conceal that he's bee reading it. He offers a hand. Stuart manages to restrain impulse to embrace him, but takes the hand warmly.
77) 15) dialog: Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
77) 19) dialog: JTS...?
77) 23) dialog: I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
77) 27) dialog: No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
77) 28) text: Meaning he can't talk about it. Stuart nods. Danny notice young woman: dark, curly hair, sharp eyes.
77) 32) dialog: Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
77) 39) dialog: Wow, that's uh...great...
77) 45) text: Danny gives her a dirty look, but Stuart's thrilled:
77) 54) dialog: I always won.
77) 59) text: Danny smiles. He has no intention of going. Once they lea he picks up the book and resumes reading.
78) 5) dialog: I have a job.
78) 9) dialog: You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
78) 13) dialog: Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
78) 20) dialog: People still need values, beliefs....
78) 24) dialog: I don't care about money.
78) 28) dialog: You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
78) 31) text: On Danny, troubled by this.
79) 1) text: A half-dozen white lumpen sit at desks. Danny writes "ANT SEMITISM" in large letters on a blackboard. He turns....
79) 3) dialog: How many of you think of yourselves as anti-Semites? (All the hands go up.) Good. Actually, the term is a bit imprecise since technically Jews are only one of the Semitic peoples.... In fact, Arabs are Semites, as are the Eritreans, the Ethiopians, and so on.... But for our purposes an anti- Semite is someone who hates or is against Jews.... Now, why do we hate them?
79) 6) dialog: Let me put it another way. Do we hate them because they push their way in where they don't belong? Or because they're clannish and keep to themselves?
80) 3) dialog: ...Because they're tight with money, or because they flash it around? Because they're Bolsheviks or because they're capitalists? Because they have the highest IQs, or because they have the most active sex lives?
80) 6) dialog: Do you want to know the real reason we hate them?...
81) 4) dialog: ...Because we hate them. (as people exchange puzzled looks) Because they exist. Because it is an axiom of civilization that just as man longs for woman, loves his children and fears death, he hates the Jews. (smiles) There is no reason. If there were, some smart-ass kike would give us an argument, try to prove we were wrong. And of course that would only make us hate them more. In fact we have all the reasons we need in three simple letters: J-E-W. Jew. Say it a million times. It is the only word that never loses its meaning: Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew....
82) 1) text: Danny and Kyle sitting in the tall grass across the marshlands toward the Manhattan skyline shimmering in the distance.
84) 4) text: DANNY...sitting with Stuart and Miriam...
84) 8) dialog: (to himself) It's not his only son....
84) 11) text: Danny looks at AVI (athletic, smooth-shaven) who grins sardonically and fakes a punch as...
84) 13) dialog: They only kill them when they love them?
84) 23) dialog: And Christianity's the same, with minor variations.
84) 35) dialog: What's a fascist?
84) 39) dialog: Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
84) 43) dialog: They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
84) 47) dialog: They had Sabra and Shattila.
84) 50) text: Danny's startled by the question, but before he can react
84) 58) dialog: Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
84) 62) dialog: The Nazis did everything the fГјhrer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
85) 1) text: Miriam and Danny walk down West End Avenue together. He's oddly relaxed with her?
85) 5) dialog: (after a beat) To hear them read Torah.
85) 9) dialog: That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
85) 16) dialog: I can't help what I think.
85) 23) dialog: (startled) How did you...?
85) 27) dialog: You mean the Times guy?
85) 31) dialog: With the shoes... There was more than one?
86) 1) text: Sweltering heat. A fan ruffles Carla's hair as she lies o the futon going back and forth between Hebrew/English Tor and a Hebrew grammar. Danny is on the floor lifting weigh
86) 5) dialog: (correcting her) V'asitem...
86) 9) dialog: (still exercising) No difference.
86) 13) dialog: (to himself) Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
86) 17) dialog: About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
86) 21) dialog: No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
86) 25) dialog: Don't curse in front of it.
86) 29) dialog: You shouldn't.
86) 34) dialog: No, I think you shouldn't.
86) 39) dialog: You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
86) 43) dialog: Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
86) 51) dialog: What...? You think I'm Jewish?
86) 54) text: Danny's taken aback by the simple logic.
86) 56) dialog: Nazis talk about it all the time.
86) 61) dialog: The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
86) 65) dialog: Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
86) 69) dialog: You want a punch in the mouth?
86) 73) dialog: Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
87) 2) text: DOWN IN FRONT: Mrs. Moebius and Danny talk in low tones.
87) 7) dialog: We tested the new bomb.
87) 11) dialog: We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
88) 1) text: Danny steps to the lectern. The CROWD QUIETS. He stands silent for a long moment, then closes his eyes and chants with feeling:
88) 3) dialog: Shema yisroel adonai elohenu adonai echod.
88) 6) dialog: Who knows what that is?
88) 10) dialog: Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?
88) 13) text: Nervous laughter. Danny laughs with them.
88) 15) dialog: That could be one reason. What's another? (no response) Let me put it this way...who here would like to destroy the Jews? (murmurs of approval) Who wants to grind their bones into the dust?
88) 18) dialog: And who wants to see them rise again, wealthier, more successful, powerful, cultured and intelligent than ever?
88) 21) dialog: Then you know what you have to do?... You have to love them.
88) 24) dialog: Did he say love them? Love the Jews? It sounds strange, I know, but with these people nothing is simple. The Jew says that all he wants is to be left alone to study his Torah, do a little business and fornicate with his over-sexed wife.... But it isn't true. He wants to be hated. He longs for our scorn. He clings to it as if it were the very core and mystery of his being. If Hitler had not existed, the Jews would have invented him. For without such hatred, the so-called Chosen People would vanish from the earth....
88) 27) dialog: ...And this reveals a terrible truth, the crux of our problem as Nazis: the worse the Jews are treated, the stronger they become. Egyptian slavery made them a nation; the pogroms hardened them, Auschwitz gave birth to the State of Israel. Suffering, it seems, is the very crucible of their genius. If the Jews are, as one of their own has said, a people who will not take yes for an answer, then let us say yes to them. If they thrive on opposition, let us cease to oppose them. The way to annihilate them, utterly and completely, is to open our arms, take them into our homes and embrace them. Only then will they vanish into assimilation, dilution...and love. (a warning finger) But we cannot pretend. The Jew is nothing if not clever. He will see through condescension and hypocrisy. To destroy him, we will have to love him sincerely.
88) 28) text: ON THE AUDIENCE, befuddled. A HAND goes up. Danny nods to The man steps forward, and we see that it's Guy Danielsen the Times. Danny is shaken....
88) 32) dialog: (after a beat) Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
88) 35) dialog: It is the Jews' destiny to the annihilated so that they can be deified.... (the murmurs swell) Jesus understood this perfectly. And look what was accomplished there with the death of just one enlightened Jew. Imagine what would happen if we killed them all!! (over the rising outrage) So, let us say together... Shema yisroel...
89) 1) text: Danny talks to Mrs. Moebius. Offscreen we hear a TV.
