6) 23) dialog: (it clicks in--) You spoke to my brother. Mac looks again at the card, noting the Chicago address.
6) 24) dialog: What brings you way out here?
6) 26) dialog: Well, I’m glad you did. Welcome! Kroc’s eyes drift to the busy, humming restaurant.
6) 28) dialog: Care for a little tour? There’s nothing Kroc would like more.
7) 1) dialog: Speed... ON MAC-- leading Kroc through the kitchen.
7) 2) dialog: That’s the name of the game. They come to a massive GRILL manned by THREE COOKS.
7) 3) dialog: First stop for every McDonald's hamburger is the grill, manned by three cooks whose sole job is to grill those all-beef beauties to perfection. Kroc watches the mouth-watering beef sizzling on the gril
7) 4) dialog: Meanwhile... He leads Kroc to an adjacent station, where two DRESSERS stand before a rotating Lazy Susan with 24 BUN TOPS on it
7) 5) dialog: As the patty cooks, our “dressers” get the bun ready. DRESSER #1 puts pickle slices and onion on each bun--
7) 6) dialog: Every McDonald’s hamburger gets two pickles, a pinch of onion... --while DRESSER #2 applies a squirt of ketchup and mustar with a pair of trigger-operated CONDIMENT GUNS.
7) 7) dialog: ..-and a precise shot of ketchup and mustard.
7) 9) dialog: We made ‘em.
7) 11) dialog: Custom built. Whole kitchen is. 15. ON KROC-- utterly amazed.
7) 12) dialog: (resuming tour) Next it’s off to the finishing station... ANGLE ON the Lazy Susan, carrying 24 fully dressed bun to traveling along a belt toward a FINISHING STATION.
7) 13) dialog: Where it all comes together. A pair of FINISHERS put cooked patties onto the fully dre bun tops, then put on bun bottoms and neatly wrap it up.
7) 14) dialog: Voila! The finished product is fed into an angled metal sleeve t slides them to the front counter, where cashiers can grab bag them with ease.
7) 15) dialog: A fresh and delicious hamburger, grill to counter in 30 seconds. ON KROC-- dumbfounded by what he’s seen. He looks at Mac.
7) 17) dialog: Did I come up with all of this? (sly smile) I didn’t. Kroc is confused.
7) 18) dialog: We did. Kroc follows Mac’s eyes to a MAN coming toward them.
7) 19) dialog: Dick McDonald. My brother. Kroc grabs Dick’s hand, enthusiastically shakes.
7) 22) dialog: What about ‘em? Dick leads Mac toward the FRENCH FRY STATION. Kroc follow along. Dick plucks a fry off the drying rack, hands it to Mac, who pops it in his mouth.
7) 23) dialog: Perfect.
7) 25) dialog: That's what you had it at before.
7) 27) dialog: I really think they’re spot-on.
7) 30) dialog: This is that Multimixer fella you spoke to.
7) 38) dialog: What for?
8) 1) dialog: There wasn’t a job in all of Manchester. All of New Hampshire. So we packed our bags and headed west. To Hollywood. I wanted to be in the movie business. And Dick, well, he wanted to be...
8) 3) dialog: We landed jobs driving trucks for Columbia Pictures. After a few years, we had enough saved up to buy our own little piece of show business. A little movie theater out in Glendora. Which would've been swell, except for the small matter of timing. It was September of ‘29. One minute we’re screening “Gold Diggers Of Broadway”, the next it’s “Brother, can you spare a dime?” Literally.
8) 5) dialog: Nobody in town was making any money. Except this one fella, Wylie Reid. Ran a hot dog and root beer stand. People still gotta eat, right? So we decide to set up our own stand, hot dogs and orange juice, out in Arcadia.
9) 1) dialog: It did okay, enough to keep us off the bread line, but we were hardly doing gangbusters. There just weren’t enough people in Arcadia. 19.
9) 3) dialog: Meanwhile, one town over is San Bernardino, the place is growing at a terrific clip. We want to relocate, but we’ve got no money for a new stand. That’s when my brother here gets one of his brilliant ideas. Tell him, Dick. Dick throws Mac a “That’s okay, you tell him” nod.
9) 4) dialog: “Why don’t we move the stand we’ve got? Put it on a truck!” (BEAT)
9) 6) dialog: “Why don’t we saw the restaurant in half?”
10) 1) dialog: We truck the darn thing over in two pieces, put it back together!
10) 3) dialog: We move the building, set up shop. But before we open, we decide to give the place a little tweak. It’s 1940. Drive-ins are all the rage, the hottest thing going. I say Dick, we gotta get in on this. Dick says sure. (MORE )
10) 5) dialog: Two months later, we open for business... (show-biz hands) “McDonald’s Famous Barbecue!”
11) 1) dialog: We've got a 27-item menu, barbecue slow-cooked in a real pit out back. Uniformed waitresses bring the food straight out to your car. It does gangbusters. Going great guns. But then, sales start to level off.
11) 4) dialog: Teenagers.
11) 9) dialog: Then there’s the expenses. Payroll is high due to the large staff required. Dishes are constantly getting stolen or broken.
11) 11) dialog: But one day Dick has a realization. Going over the books, he notices something. The bulk of our sales come from just three items: Burgers, fries, soft drinks.
11) 13) dialog: We say to ourselves, what the heck are we doing monkeying around with all this other stuff? Focus on what sells. Yes.
11) 14) dialog: And that’s just what we do. Brisket, gone. Tamales, gone. And we don’t stop at the menu. We look at everything. What else don’t we need?
11) 16) dialog: Carhops.
11) 18) dialog: Dishes. 22.
11) 20) dialog: Jukeboxes, cigarette machines.
11) 23) dialog: And finally, the biggest, most important cut of all... the wait.
11) 25) dialog: We decide to tear down the kitchen. Rebuild. Reconfigure. Rethink the whole dang thing. And you're gonna love how we do it. Tell him, Dick.
11) 27) dialog: He brings me out to this tennis court, draws an outline in the dirt. Exact dimensions of our kitchen.
12) 1) dialog: We bring in a bunch of employees, have ‘em go through the motions, making pretend burgers and fries. --An invisible kitchen, YOUNG EMPLOYEES mimicking the mov trying to get it right. 23.
12) 2) dialog: Dick’s chasing after them with the stick, marking up where all the equipment should go. They do it over and over, hashing out the moves, choreographing like it’s some sort of crazy burger ballet. --Over and over. It’s starting to get dark.
12) 7) dialog: Ta-da. The Speedee System is born. The world’s first-ever system designed to deliver food fast. It's totally revolutionary.
13) 1) dialog: Opening day, people pull into the lot, immediately start honking when no carhop comes over. We try to explain the walk-up window. They're bewildered. Furious. “Whaddaya mean I gotta get out of my car?” 24.
13) 3) dialog: Most of them just cuss us out and drive off. The few that stick around are mad as heck about having to eat off paper and discard their own trash.
13) 5) dialog: By five o'clock, Dick’s calculating the cost of converting back to drive-in. But me, I’m not quite ready to throw in the towel. Going back to my Hollywood roots, I say to myself, “We gotta go big with this. We gotta put on a show.” I tell Dick I want to throw a grand re-opening. A gala premiere to put Louis B. Mayer to shame.
14) 1) dialog: We rent a bunch of spotlights, the same ones we used to truck around to premieres in the Columbia days. I get sparklers, a juggler for the kiddies--it’s an event. People show up in droves. And then...
14) 4) dialog: Millions of ‘em. Looked like something out of Exodus. --Customers running, screaming. Swatting. 25.
14) 7) dialog: It’s a total disaster. Towel time. (BEAT)
15) 2) dialog: But he’s cute, I feel bad for him, so I fire up the grill, make hima batch. And as he’s heading off... --A car pulls into the lot.
15) 3) dialog: A car pulls up. --A second car.
15) 4) dialog: Then another. --A third car.
15) 5) dialog: And another. Before you know it, there’s a line around the block. --A LINE OF CUSTOMERS stretching into the distance.
15) 6) dialog: Word has spread. 26.
15) 9) dialog: We’re an overnight sensation. Thirty years in the making. ON KROC-- absorbing all of this, blown away. Mac gives Kroc a modest little shrug.
15) 10) dialog: So that’s our story.
18) 5) dialog: Those places were a mess. Filthy kitchens, inconsistent menus...
18) 7) dialog: To watch your precious creation get mismanaged like that. Your name.
18) 9) dialog: Diabetes and extreme stress don’t mix. Kroc absorbs this.
18) 11) dialog: We did.
18) 16) dialog: Better one great restaurant than 50 mediocre ones. 29.
18) 24) dialog: It’s a way to make the place stand out when you’re driving past.
18) 27) dialog: That’s pure Dick magic right there. Dick’s gaze is still on the arches, clearly proud.
25) 3) dialog: What are you doing here? Mac is there, too.
26) 3) dialog: (to Kroc) Would you please give us a minute?
27) 2) dialog: It’s your dream, Dick. (eye contact) Bigger than your dream. Arches-- your arches--coast to coast. Dick’s eyes go to the U.S. map. A whole country, just wai to be filled in with push pins. 37.
27) 4) dialog: I know how bad you want this. You should have it.
27) 6) dialog: We'll do it different this time. Learn from our mistakes.
27) 8) dialog: We keep a much tighter leash. Total oversight, every change has to go through us.
27) 10) dialog: We draw up a contract. Lay it out, clear as day in black and white. ON DICK-- pondering. Seemingly warming to the idea.
27) 11) dialog: Whaddaya say?
32) 22) dialog: Then what did he say?
32) 24) dialog: He hung up on you?
32) 26) dialog: It’ll be fine.
35) 14) dialog: He’s just a little... excitable.
35) 16) dialog: It’s all bluster, Dick. His bark is worse than his bite. 46.
49) 35) dialog: Is he a pain in the rear? Yes. Has he got a few screws loose? Maybe. But that doesn’t mean he’s going to do us any harm.
49) 37) dialog: Keep what up?
49) 39) dialog: We have a contract, Dick. For just this sort of thing.
49) 41) dialog: He’s powerless. BEAT. Dick shakes his head grimly.
49) 42) dialog: I’m sorry, Dick. 73. Dick is silent, furious at his brother. At himself.
49) 43) dialog: I just wanted you to have your... He trails off, seemingly losing his train of thought.
49) 44) dialog: I just wanted... His face grows flushed. Dick sees something is off.
49) 46) dialog: I’m sorry, Dickie... ON DICK-- recognizing what this is.
49) 47) dialog: I didn’t mean to leave the gate open...
49) 49) dialog: I didn’t mean to let Boomer get out...
49) 53) dialog: I’m okay. ON DICK-- looking at his brother with love and worry. 74. ON MAC-- gazing off at something... The Multimixer on the counter. Kroc’s machine, used to ma the shake in his hands. INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY Kroc sits at his desk. Next to a bottle of Canadian Club pile of BILLS AND INVOICES. He picks one up. It’s from ILLINOIS FIRST FEDERAL, stamped PAST DUE. He picks up ano one. From CHICAGO GAS & ELECTRIC. He stares at the amount owed.
58) 2) dialog: What is it?
66) 2) dialog: IT’S NOT YOUR COMPANY, RAY!
66) 4) dialog: Do you understand that?
66) 6) dialog: We came up with the Speedee System, not you. Us. What did you ever come up with, Ray? Name one thing. You can’t. Because you never have and you never will. You’re a leech! You're a professional leech! ON DICK-- stunned by his brother’s outburst.
66) 8) dialog: I can’t, nor would I want to.
66) 10) dialog: I want you out of this company.
66) 12) dialog: Whatever it takes. We’ll sue you if necessary.
67) 2) dialog: (BEAT, understatement of century) Some. 102.
68) 1) dialog: “William Who Rode With Paul Revere.”
68) 3) dialog: Five, fourth letter E.
68) 5) dialog: Come in. and Dick look toward the door, stunned to see... Ray Kroc, holding a bouquet of flowers. The
68) 7) dialog: That’s alright.
68) 9) dialog: What’s this?
68) 11) dialog: It looks like a blank check.
68) 13) dialog: What are you buying? Kroc flashes them a “You don’t know?” smirk.
69) 1) dialog: We'll never beat him. (BEAT)
