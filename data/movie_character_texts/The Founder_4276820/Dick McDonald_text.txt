3) 22) dialog: This is Dick.
3) 24) dialog: Yes, yes, that was me. How soon can you get ‘em out here?
3) 26) dialog: Freezer! Top shelf, left side! (back to Kroc) Sorry.
3) 28) dialog: You know what? I think that’s a mistake.
3) 30) text: Better make it eight. ON KROC-- flabbergasted. Another background SHOUT. DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D) What’s that, Al? There’s a brand- new box in the storeroom! (to Kroc) Look, now isn’t the best time.
3) 32) dialog: You know where to send ‘em, right? San Bernardino, California. Corner of 14th and E.
3) 34) dialog: Just the store is fine. McDonald's. Another BACKGROUND SHOUT distracts Dick. DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D) I gotta go. Just get those mixers out here ASAP, okay? Thanks! Click. Kroc stares at the receiver. What the hell was tha EXT. MERRIMAN’S DRIVE-IN - MOMENTS LATER Kroc stands over a U.S. ROAD MAP on the hood of his car. unfolds it, opening the map westward. (Note: This part of map is not well-worn like the Midwest; it’s virgin territ for Kroc.) Kroc’s eyes drift westward to California. They land on a small town 60 miles east of Los Angeles: San Bernardino. Kroc looks at the whole country. He notices something. A directly connecting St. Louis to San Bernardino. Route 66 ON KROC-- staring at Route 66. A single, unbroken line running from where he is now to that mysterious city out Southern California. 10.
7) 21) dialog: (to Mac, ignoring Ray) The fries.
7) 24) dialog: They're five percent too crisp. Dick takes a fry, tastes it. Frowns. DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D) I think we should drop to two minutes, 50 seconds.
7) 26) dialog: 400, not 375. Higher temp, shorter cook. Mac takes another taste.
7) 29) dialog: Who are you?
7) 32) dialog: How soon you figure we can expect ‘em?
7) 34) dialog: Good. With this, Dick abruptly walks off. Ray gives chase.
7) 36) dialog: (jokey) You're really not my type.
8) 2) dialog: Employed.
8) 4) dialog: I couldn't.
11) 3) dialog: The drive-in model, as we learn, has a few built-in problems. Kroc leans in, eager to hear their take on this. DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D) For starters, there’s the customer issue. Drive-ins tend to attract, shall we say, a less-than desirable clientele.
11) 5) dialog: Hot rodders and hooligans. Juvenile delinquents in blue jeans. Kroc nods, all too familiar. DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D) Then there’s the service. It takes forever and a day for your food to arrive. And when it finally does--
11) 7) dialog: The carhops are too busy dodging gropes to remember you wanted a strawberry phosphate, not cherry.
11) 10) dialog: Tremendous overhead.
11) 12) dialog: 87 percent.
11) 15) dialog: Turns out, quite a lot.
11) 17) dialog: Walk up to a window. Get your food yourself.
11) 19) dialog: All paper packaging. Disposable.
11) 21) dialog: Drive out the riff-raff.
11) 24) dialog: Orders ready in 30 seconds, not 30 minutes.
11) 26) dialog: The tennis court?
12) 3) dialog: Finally, after about six hours of this, we get it just right. --Workers making pretend burgers and fries in perfect syn
12) 4) dialog: A symphony of efficiency. Not a wasted motion.
12) 6) dialog: We take the layout to a builder, custom build to exact specs.
12) 8) dialog: And a complete disaster.
13) 4) dialog: We may have underestimated the learning curve.
14) 2) dialog: The flies. --An ominous cloud gathers over the restaurant. A SWARM O INSECTS. They swoop down in unison, as if in attack mode.
14) 3) dialog: They must've been drawn by all the lights.
14) 5) dialog: The Pharaoh would’ve released the Israelites.
15) 1) dialog: I tell him we're closed.
15) 8) dialog: And it’s off to the races.
17) 2) dialog: Beg pardon?
17) 4) dialog: Mr. Kroc...
17) 8) dialog: Mr. Kroc-—
17) 10) dialog: We already tried!
18) 1) dialog: Five. ANGLE ON map. Five PUSH PINS are stuck in it, clustered around California and the Southwest. DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D) Three in Southern California, one in Sacramento and one in Phoenix. (BEAT)
18) 4) dialog: Two words: Quality control. It’s almost impossible to enforce standards from afar.
18) 6) dialog: Sacramento was selling burritos.
18) 8) dialog: Put Mac in the hospital. Kroc looks at Mac, surprised. A BEAT as
18) 13) dialog: He obviously didn’t do a great job.
18) 15) dialog: Our energies are better spent making this place the best it can possibly be.
18) 18) dialog: Thank you, we’re not interested.
18) 20) dialog: Thank you. Kroc backs off. A BEAT of awkward silence. Kroc’s eye goes to something else on the wall... a BLUEPR The building has towering arches on each side.
18) 22) dialog: A blueprint.
18) 25) dialog: “The Golden Arches” I call ‘em. Kroc stares at them, fascinated. It’s a crazy, radical (a kind of brilliant) thing to stick on the sides of a build
18) 29) dialog: Just one... 30. Dick looks at the U.S. map. A lonely push pin in the midd of Arizona. DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D) Phoenix. EXT. ROUTE 66 - SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA/ARIZONA -— DAY Kroc driving back along Route 66, taking in the scenery. SERIES OF SHOTS: Kroc passing through various small towns each with a Main Street running through it. On every Main Street, we see the same two things: a church and courthou Glimpses of various churches and courthouses. Churches to with crosses. Courthouses with American flags. ON KROC-- processing, wheels turning.
25) 2) dialog: (turns, surprised) Ray.
25) 6) dialog: (to nearby employee) Tommy, finish the buns.
27) 1) dialog: (tempted, torn) I don’t know...
27) 3) dialog: I can’t put you through that again. ON MAC-- looking at Dick gazing longingly at the map.
27) 5) dialog: Last time, you very nearly wound up—
27) 7) dialog: How so?
27) 9) dialog: Who says he’s gonna listen?
32) 2) dialog: Hiya, Ray. 42.
32) 5) dialog: These things take time. You're proposing substantial alterations.
32) 7) dialog: We need our architect to thoroughly review it to make sure everything's safe and up to code.
32) 9) dialog: I’m not sure, to be honest.
32) 11) dialog: Ray, you need to take a breath. It hasn’t even been a week.
32) 13) dialog: I’m not the one who scheduled that.
32) 15) dialog: Hopefully, it won’t come to that.
32) 19) dialog: I understand. But you have to understand, it’s our name on that building. God forbid the floor caves in and people get hurt or worse because of some design flaw we missed, we’re the ones on the hook. So let’s just slow down a minute and make sure it’s done the right way. Alright? pondering Dick’s words of reason.
32) 23) dialog: He slammed down the phone.
32) 25) dialog: Unless we got violently disconnected. Dick looks off, feeling the first pangs of buyer’s remors
35) 1) dialog: I’m sorry, Ray, but we’re just not comfortable with the notion of turning our menu into an advertisement.
35) 3) dialog: It’s distasteful.
35) 5) dialog: There are plenty of things we could do to make a quick buck, but that doesn’t mean we should.
35) 7) dialog: Well, we don’t.
35) 9) dialog: Because I have no interest in indulging in that sort of crass commercialism. It’s not McDonald's.
35) 11) dialog: I happen to be a card-carrying Republican.
35) 15) dialog: A hothead like that, you don’t know what he’s capable of.
35) 17) dialog: (dark chuckle) That’s what Neville Chamberlain said.
49) 1) dialog: Hiya, Ray.
49) 5) dialog: Ray, those are the terms.
49) 7) dialog: It’s more than triple our cut.
49) 9) dialog: I’m not a greedy man.
49) 11) dialog: I have no beef with the current rate of expansion.
49) 13) dialog: All in good time.
49) 15) dialog: I have no doubt it’1l come.
49) 17) dialog: And you're doing a bang-up job.
49) 19) dialog: I don’t know what to say.
49) 21) dialog: I can’t.
49) 23) dialog: Upping your cut, it wouldn’t be fair to the franchisees.
49) 25) dialog: You freely and willingly agreed to the terms of your deal, Ray. Nobody put a gun to your head.
49) 27) dialog: No.
49) 29) dialog: Ray...
49) 31) dialog: No.
49) 36) dialog: How long are you going to keep this up, Mac?
49) 38) dialog: The whole “everything is fine” act. (eye contact) There’s a wolf in the henhouse! And we let him in! ON MAC-- looking nauseous. Guilty. DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D) I never should have listened.
49) 40) dialog: I should have trusted my gut.
49) 45) dialog: Mac.
49) 48) dialog: Take a seat.
49) 50) dialog: (moving toward brother) Mac, you're having one of your-- CRASH. Mac flops over, crashing to the floor.
49) 52) dialog: A few more sips. Mac takes a sip of the shake. His sleeves are rolled up, revealing a MEDIC ALERT BRACELET. Engraved on it is DIABE TYPE 1.
54) 1) dialog: (instantly wary) Hello, Ray. ON MAC-- cleaning up in the background. His ears prick up
54) 3) dialog: And what would that be?
54) 5) dialog: Ray--
54) 7) dialog: Is this some sort of joke?
54) 9) dialog: Ray.
54) 11) dialog: I have no interest in a milkshake that contains no milk.
54) 13) dialog: Why don’t we put sawdust in the hamburgers while we’re at it?
54) 15) dialog: Frozen french fries!
54) 17) dialog: Not like that.
54) 19) dialog: It’s called a milk shake, Ray.
54) 21) dialog: Milk. Now and forever. ON KROC-- shut down. Yet again.
58) 1) dialog: Have you heard of the Franchise Realty Corporation? Mac turns, sees Dick holding the letter.
58) 3) dialog: I have no clue. But apparently Ray Kroc is president and CEO. Mac takes the letter, instantly nauseous. ANGLE ON letter, written on FRANCHISE REALTY CORPORATION letterhead. The letter itself is some innocuous bit of McDonald's business from Kroc to the brothers. It’s reall just an excuse to flash the letterhead. And the signature the bottom: RAYMOND A. KROC - PRESIDENT/CEO
59) 5) dialog: Well, if you really want to know, I’m tad miffed.
59) 7) dialog: Franchise Realty Corporation.
59) 9) dialog: For starters, would you mind telling me what it is?
59) 11) dialog: You know full well you can’t do something like that without first clearing it.
59) 13) dialog: Why? Because as your deal plainly states, any and all changes must—
59) 15) dialog: Excuse me?
59) 17) dialog: Anything relating to McDonald's is within our--
62) 1) dialog: I just got a very disconcerting call. Kroc on the other end--Harry, Fred and June listening in. Kroc has a smug, cocky air, “playing to the crowd” a bit.
62) 3) dialog: From Buddy Jepsen. Our operator in Sacramento.
62) 5) dialog: He told me he received a shipment this morning.
62) 7) dialog: You are way out of line, Ray.
62) 9) dialog: Would you mind telling me what you're doing shipping four cases of Inst-A-Mix to one of our operators?
62) 11) dialog: Us?
62) 13) dialog: Who did you send them to?
62) 15) dialog: You have no right, Ray. You are to stop this instant. Is that clear?
62) 17) dialog: Excuse me?
62) 19) dialog: What the hell’s that mean? 97.
62) 21) dialog: You will abide by the terms of your deal.
62) 23) dialog: You have a contract.
62) 25) dialog: If phony powdered milkshakes is your idea of progress, you have a profound misunderstanding of what McDonald’s is about.
62) 27) dialog: What did you say?
62) 29) dialog: You will do as we say.
62) 31) dialog: You have a contract.
66) 1) dialog: What’s confusing is you calling yourself the McDonald's Corporation. ON MAC-- listening, strangely calm. 100. DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D) People will think it’s the whole company, not just the real-estate arm. Which I strongly suspect is what you hope. Without warning, Mac SNATCHES THE PHONE out of Dick’s han
68) 2) dialog: How many letters?
68) 4) dialog: Dawes. pencils it in. A knock at the door.
69) 5) dialog: $2.7 million. (BEAT)
69) 6) text: A million for each of us after taxes. ON KROC-- taken aback by the staggering sum. DICK MCDONALD (CONT’D) And one percent of the company’s profits in perpetuity. INT. KROC’S OFFICE - DAY Kroc is pacing furiously before Harry Sonneborn.
70) 5) dialog: I just have to ask you one thing. Something I’ve never understood.
70) 7) dialog: That day we met, when we gave you the tour.
70) 9) dialog: We showed you everything. The whole system, all our secrets. We were an open book. (Kroc nods) So why didn’t you just--
70) 11) dialog: How do you know?
70) 13) dialog: And? 107.
70) 15) dialog: Lots of people started restaurants.
70) 17) dialog: Which is...
70) 19) dialog: Enlighten me.
70) 22) dialog: That’s clearly not the case.
70) 24) dialog: And if you can’t beat ‘em...
70) 26) dialog: You don’t “have” it.
