And I’m just the man to help you do it. I’ve spent the better part of my life criss-crossing this country. I know every highway and byway, every city and every town.
17) 5) dialog: Let me just say one thing. One more thing. (MORE)
17) 7) dialog: I want to confess something to you boys. I’m not out here in California on any business meeting. I’m out here for you. You’re what brought me out. A few days ago, I was standing outside a filling station in St. Louis, Missouri staring at a U.S. road map, staring at a long, white, unbroken line called Route 66. I took my finger--
17) 9) dialog: I took my finger, and I traced that line from where I was standing all the way out to California, where it ran smack-dab into this place we are now. As I stared at that line, something told me to follow it. Something told me to get in my car and see what’s out there at the other end. And when I laid eyes on your hamburger stand yesterday, all those people lined up to purchase your remarkable product, I knew it was-—-
18) 3) dialog: Why? 28.
18) 10) dialog: But if you had somebody in charge of supervising.

21) 1) dialog: Ethel! Kroc comes bursting in, burning with excitement. RAY KROC (CONT’D) I’ve seen the future! Ethel’s face falls.
21) 3) dialog: I saw a restaurant, Ethel. It’s like nothing you’ve ever seen. They've got this system, the Speedee System...
21) 5) dialog: Just hear me out.
21) 7) dialog: This place, it’s like something sprung from the mind of Henry--
21) 9) dialog: Don’t you want to be a part of greatness?
21) 12) dialog: Ethel, this place--
21) 14) dialog: (bristles at her sarcasm) As a matter of fact...
21) 17) dialog: (flash of anger) Maybe if I had a wife who had an ounce of vision. Who gave me an ounce of support.
21) 20) dialog: (backing off, chastened) I’m sorry.

26) 1) dialog: That drive back home on 66, I passed through a lot of towns. A lot of small towns. In the middle of each one of them was a Main Street. And on each of those Main Streets were always the same two things: a courthouse and a church. A courthouse topped with a flag. A church topped with a cross. Flags and crosses, crosses and flags. The brothers look at each other, unsure where this is goi RAY KROC (CONT’D) As I drove along, I pondered those crosses and flags. I asked myself why they’re so ubiquitous. What they mean. And as I did, I couldn’t help but think about your restaurant. About these-- 36. He goes over to the blueprint, plants a finger on the arc RAY KROC (CONT’D) Now, forgive me if this flirts with blasphemy, but to my mind, these arches share a great deal in common with the Christian cross and the American flag. A building topped with a cross is a gathering place. A place where decent, wholesome folks can come together and be with others who share their values. The same can be said of a building flanked by a pair of your arches. Those arches mean more than simply “delicious hamburgers inside”. They signify family. Community. The ties that bind. They represent goodness, togetherness, a place for Americans to gather and break bread. McDonald’s can be that, too. The new American church, feeding bodies and feeding souls. And not just on Sundays. Seven days a week. (BEAT)

56) 12) dialog: That’s very nice.
56) 14) dialog: Your point being...
56) 18) dialog: June, fetch the ledger. INT. KROC’S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER Kroc and Sonneborn sit in front of the ledger.
56) 21) dialog: I believe that covers it. ON SONNEBORN-- thinking.
56) 23) dialog: Land?
56) 25) dialog: Well, it’s pretty simple really. The franchisee finds a piece of land he likes, takes out a lease. Usually 20-year. He gets himself a construction loan, puts up the building, and off he goes.
56) 27) dialog: Yes.
56) 29) dialog: Correct. ON SONNEBORN-- processing. He seems troubled. RAY KROC (CONT’D) Is there a problem?
56) 31) dialog: Which is?
56) 38) dialog: If I were to do this... the brothers... this would effectively...
59) 4) dialog: Hello, Dick. How are you?
59) 6) dialog: What seems to be the trouble?
59) 8) dialog: What about it?
59) 10) dialog: Oh, nothing really. Just a little something I created to help provide leasing services and support to our new franchisees. Dick can practically hear Kroc’s smirk through the phone.
59) 12) dialog: Why would I need to do that?
59) 14) dialog: It’s not a change.
59) 16) dialog: It’s not a change. It’s a company. Its own separate company. Which puts it outside of your purview. 91.
59) 18) dialog: You boys have full say over what goes on inside the restaurants. But outside? Above? Below?... Your authority stops at the door. And the floor. ON MAC-- standing in the doorway, sick to his stomach. He can’t hear what Kroc is saying, but he knows it’s not goo INT. KROC’S OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY Kroc is leaning against his desk, arms folded confidently big grin on his face. It’s a slightly weird sight until w hear the click of a camera and realize it’s a PHOTO SHOOT
60) 2) dialog: (like a delivery guy) Where ya want these?
61) 2) dialog: I’ve thought it over. ON JOAN-- also there, anxiously awaiting Kroc’s next word RAY KROC (CONT’D) Approved.
61) 4) dialog: Thank you. It’s a whiz-bang idea. And you thought of it. Kroc revels in the feeling of playing kingmaker.
61) 6) dialog: To heck with that. I’m rolling it out nationally. Joan gasps, honored, thrilled. Her idea, implemented acro the country. ON ROLLIE-- looking at Joan looking at Ray. We finally de the first stirrings of jealousy. RAY KROC (CONT’D) Speaking of Inst-A-Mix, have you seen the new issue of “RBM”? 93. Kroc reaches inside his coat, pulls out a copy of “Restau Business Monthly”. Hands it to Rollie. RAY KROC (CONT’D) Hot off the press. ON ROLLIE-- taking in the cover... ANGLE ON magazine. Kroc is the cover boy. A big photo of in his office, smiling, holding the hamburger. The headli MCDONALD’S TAKES A BITE OUT OF THE COMPETITION - UPSTART HAMBURGER EMPORIUM IS ‘ON THE GROW’ ON JOAN-- looking at Ray on the cover. Looking at Ray in flesh. INT. KROC’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT Ethel is asleep in bed, alone.
61) 8) dialog: (intrigued) Bloomington... INT. ROLLIE AND JOAN SMITH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Joan is on the kitchen phone, also speaking softly. She’s wearing a nightie.
61) 10) dialog: I read about that.
61) 12) dialog: I think I see where you’re going with this...
61) 15) dialog: Hungry families looking for a bite after the ballgame.
61) 17) dialog: I like the way you think, Joan. You think big.
61) 19) dialog: You'd be surprised. His gaze drifts downward. To his wedding ring. RAY KROC (CONT’D) A lot of people, they’re scared. Of taking a chance. Reaching for greatness.
61) 21) dialog: I agree. Ambition, that’s the stuff of life.
61) 23) dialog: Absolutely.
61) 25) dialog: Are you calling me bold, Joan?
61) 29) dialog: I still say Houston’s the move.
62) 2) dialog: Oh?
62) 4) dialog: I’m well aware who Buddy Jepsen is. 96.
62) 6) dialog: It arrived?
62) 8) dialog: I figured it wouldn’t get there until Friday the earliest.
62) 10) dialog: If you’re not interested in turning a profit, that’s fine. But please don’t stop the rest of us.
62) 12) dialog: Us. As in everyone but you.
62) 14) dialog: Everyone but you.
62) 16) dialog: Nah.
62) 18) dialog: You heard me. Nah.
62) 20) dialog: It means from now on I’1l be doing things my way.
62) 22) dialog: I’m through taking marching orders from you. Bowing to your dictates. You and your endless parade of nos.
62) 24) dialog: Don’t grow, don’t change... Cower in the face of progress...
62) 26) dialog: I have a far better understanding of McDonald’s than you two yokels.
62) 28) dialog: You heard me.
62) 30) dialog: Nope.
62) 32) dialog: Contracts are like hearts. They’re made to be broken. INT. KROC’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT Kroc and Ethel eat dinner together in edgy silence. All w hear is the sound of knife scraping plate as meat is cut. 98.
62) 34) dialog: You’re welcome. Another stretch of silence. Cutting and chewing. RAY KROC (CONT’D) I want a divorce.
63) 3) dialog: I don’t care what it takes.
63) 5) dialog: Just get me out.
63) 7) dialog: She can have it all. The house, the car, the insurance policy...
63) 9) dialog: Never. I'd sooner die than give that woman one share of McDonald’s.
64) 1) dialog: His dismay is soon eclipsed by something else: The note from Kroc; it’s not on Franchise Realty Corporat letterhead. The letterhead says THE MCDONALD'S CORPORATIO It’s signed at the bottom RAYMOND A. KROC - PRESIDENT.
65) 1) dialog: It was confusing. INT. KROC’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Kroc on the phone.
65) 2) dialog: No one knew it had anything to do with McDonald's.
66) 3) dialog: Mac.
66) 5) dialog: Don’t get all bent out of shape.
66) 7) dialog: Would you like to know what I came up with? I’1l tell you, Mac. I came up with a concept. A highly novel concept called winning. You boys are content to sit back and be a couple of also-rans. To let the future run roughshod over you. Me, I want to take the future. I want to win. And you don’t get there by being some aw-shucks, nice-guy sap. There’s no place in business for people like that. Business is war. It’s rat eat rat, dog eat dog. If my competitor was drowning, I'd reach out and stick a goddamn hose in his mouth. Can you say the same?
66) 9) dialog: Hence your single location. 101.
66) 11) dialog: And how do you propose to do that?
66) 13) dialog: You couldn't afford to sue me. I could bury you in court costs alone. I’m the president and CEO of a major corporation with landholdings in 17 states. You run a burger stand in the desert. (blistering, nuclear) I’m national. You’re fucking local. Kroc hears a loud THUD through the phone. Mac has COLLAPSED to the floor. The wail of an AMBULANCE SIREN carries us to--
68) 6) dialog: How ya feelin’? brothers glare at their unexpected, unwelcome guest. RAY KROC (CONT’D) That was some spill. Felt it all the way through the phone. Kroc extends the flowers to Mac. RAY KROC (CONT’D) For you. 103. Mac takes the flowers like they’re potentially laced with anthrax. He glances at the card attached. RAY KROC (CONT’D) Open it.
68) 8) dialog: Please. I think you’1l like it. Mac reaches in the envelope, pulls out a GET-WELL CARD. H opens the card. A CHECK falls out. Blank.
68) 10) dialog: What’s it look like?
68) 12) dialog: Then that’s probably what it is. Mac and Dick look at each other. RAY KROC (CONT’D) How much should I make it out for?
69) 4) dialog: Hiya, Dick. On the other end is Dick, in the KITCHEN in San Bernardin
69) 7) dialog: It’s outrageous! Borderline extortion! Sonneborn is holding a document. A PURCHASE PROPOSAL from brothers.
69) 9) dialog: What?
69) 11) dialog: I need San Bernardino. I was counting on its profits to cover the debt on the purchase loan.
70) 2) dialog: On the insistence of my investor group. Their financing is contingent on leaving it out of the contract. It’s unfortunately a dealbreaker for them. Dick and Mac look at each other, extremely wary. RAY KROC (CONT’D) You have my word you’1ll get your full due royalties. He extends his hand, holding it out to them.
70) 4) dialog: Hello, Dick. ON DICK-- gazing searchingly at Kroc.
70) 6) dialog: Alright.
70) 8) dialog: What about it?
70) 10) dialog: Rip you off? Run off and start my own place using your ideas? (Dick nods) Because it would have failed.
70) 12) dialog: Am I the only one who ever got the kitchen tour? I bet you invited loads of people back there. Countless would-be burger barons looking to replicate your success.
70) 14) dialog: How many succeeded?
70) 16) dialog: Bigger than McDonald's? (Dick is silent) Of course not. No one has and no one ever will. Because they all lack that one thing that makes McDonald's special.
70) 18) dialog: Even you don’t know!
70) 20) dialog: It’s not just the system. It’s the name. Dick doesn’t follow. RAY KROC (CONT’D) That name. That glorious name. McDonald. It’s wide open. Limitless. It could be anything, whatever you want it to be. It sounds like... America. (BEAT)
70) 23) text: So you don’t have a check for $1.35 million in your pocket? Dick is silenced. RAY KROC (CONT’D) That's the mistake your competitors made. All those would-be imitators. They assumed they could simply take your system, slap on some name like Hamburger Hamlet or Roscoe’s, and presto! Instant success! Not me, I wasn’t so arrogant. I knew there’s no beating a name like McDonald's.
70) 25) dialog: Buy ‘em. Dick chuckles in disgust. RAY KROC (CONT’D) I'll never forget the first time I saw that name stretched across the front of your stand. It was love at first sight. From that moment, I knew I just had to have it. And now I do.
70) 27) dialog: You sure about that? Kroc throws him an unnerving smile.
71) 7) dialog: Call my office. They’1l set it up. He reaches into the breast pocket of his sport coat. 110. RAY KROC (CONT’D) Here’s my card. He hands a BUSINESS CARD to the reporter. He looks at it. ANGLE ON card. Beneath a McDonald’s logo, it says, simply
71) 8) dialog: We hold on this for a long BEAT.
71) 9) dialog: Now, I know what you’re thinking...
72) 0) text: A lavish, gated MANSION. A BLACK LIMOUSINE pulls into the driveway. INT. MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM —- CONTINUOUS A tuxedo-clad Ray Kroc stands before a mirror, stack of i cards in hand. He’s 68 now; it’s nine years later, 1970.
72) 1) dialog: How the heck does an over-the-hill 52-year-old milkshake-machine salesman build a fast-food empire with 1,600 restaurants in 50 states and five foreign countries, with annual revenues in the neighborhood of $700 million? It’s quite simple: persistence. He turns to the next card. RAY KROC (CONT’D) Nothing in the world can take the place of good old persistence. Talent won't. Nothing’s more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius won't. Unrecognized genius is practically a cliché. His words have a familiar ring... They’re lifted straight from “The Power Of The Positive” by Dr. Clarence Floyd Ne (the record from the beginning of the movie), with just a of rephrasing to make it “his own”. RAY KROC (CONT’D) Education won’t. The world is full of educated fools. (MORE )
72) 2) text: RAY KROC (CONT’D) Persistence and determination alone are all-powerful. He pauses a beat to let his words of wisdom sink in. RAY KROC (CONT’D) There’s no obstacle under the sun that can’t be overcome with honest hard work and determination. It’s these core principles that enabled me to rise to the top of the heap at a point in life when most men would be thinking about retirement. (glances to side, sly grin) We appear to have that in common, Mr. Governor. He pauses for laughter. RAY KROC (CONT’D) You were, what, 55 when you started in politics? Why, you make me look like a spring chicken! Another pause for laughter. RAY KROC (CONT’D) Look at us, a couple of small-town Illinois boys made good. Only in America... He continues talking to Mr. Governor off to the side-- RAY KROC (CONT’D) By the way, thank you for that splendid introduction. To be named California Chamber of Commerce Man of The Year is thrill enough, but to be presented the award by my dear friend and golf buddy Ronald Reagan, well, that’s just the cherry on the sundae. He turns to the next index card. RAY KROC (CONT’D) Now where was I? Ah, yes, the beginning. The year was 1954. The place, Des Plaines, Illinois. That's where it all started. Right there on Lee Street-- 112.
72) 4) dialog: (to her reflection) Be right down. She nods, exits the room. Kroc looks down at the card in his hand, finding his plac
73) 2) dialog: Oh, yes. (placid) Very. CAMERA slowly pushes in on Kroc’s face as he rides in silence. He looks at Joan, smiles. He indeed seems comfortable. Very. FADE TO BLACK. 113.
