I mention it because I believe it’s applicable here: Do you not need a Multimixer because you're not selling enough milk shakes? Or are you not selling enough milk shakes because you don’t have a Multimixer? I firmly believe it’s the latter. You see, your customers, they know that if they order a shake from your establishment, it’s going to be a terrific wait. They’ve ordered one before, and by golly they’re not gonna make that mistake again. But if you had, say, a Prince Castle- brand five-spindle Multimixer with patented direct-drive electric motor, you could greatly increase your ability to produce delicious, frosty milk shakes fast. And before long, mark my words, dollars to donuts, you'd be selling more of those suckers than you can shake a stick at. Increase supply, demand will follow. Chicken and the egg. You follow my logic? Of course you do. You’re a bright, forward- thinking fella who knows a good idea when he hears it. (BEAT)
