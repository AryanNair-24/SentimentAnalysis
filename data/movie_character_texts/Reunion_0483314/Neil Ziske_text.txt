I'm not saying that God created AIDS to kill them, but it's just like "look, nothing good comes out of sex when it's not in marriage."
117) 20) dialog: No way, man. Look, in college I didn't care. I would tell anything to a girl just to get her in bed. And girls believed it, and I hurt'em. I'd tell them that I loved them, and they believed it. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
