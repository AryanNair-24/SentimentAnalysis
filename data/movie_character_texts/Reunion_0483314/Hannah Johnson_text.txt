28) 8) dialog: No... not really.
28) 10) dialog: Yeah, right now I think it is. I'm just concentrating on my music.
28) 12) dialog: I finally feel like I'm choosing music, instead of it choosing me, you know? I always felt like I retreated to my guitar because I was alone or- or didn't have a boyfriend. But now, I've got "boyfriends" and- and I've still got my guitar, too.
28) 16) dialog: Maybe. They sip their coffee.
28) 17) dialog: It looks like you're really happy here.

32) 20) dialog: Close. I sat near the door, right next to you.
32) 22) dialog: Pimples... and glasses... and braces? Jacob laughs a little and looks at the others, not sure i she's serious or not.
32) 24) dialog: (interrupting) --It's alright. There's not much to remember.

37) 6) dialog: Yeah? Who do you like?
37) 8) dialog: I have lots of favorites.
37) 10) dialog: David Wilcox comes to mind. His music is so introspective. It really speaks to me, you know? They start walking again.

50) 15) dialog: What happened?
50) 17) dialog: No, I don't.
50) 21) dialog: Limburg Cheese?
50) 24) dialog: Of course.
50) 30) dialog: A logical assumption.
50) 36) dialog: Oh, I do remember. That was night of our Junior prom? Tom reaches for another beer.
50) 41) dialog: That is so funny.
51) 1) dialog: God! That is so gross. The laughter continues.
51) 2) dialog: I can't believe I wore that thing for twelve years.
51) 4) dialog: Big deal, grey pants and a tie. Hannah and Neil sit on the couch looking at a yearbook. (CONTINUED)
51) 9) dialog: (imitating a man's voice) That'll be "double trouble" detention for you young lady. And this makes everyone laugh even harder.
51) 11) dialog: That was Mr. Morton.
51) 13) dialog: Remember he made us memorize that quote, "Sin is a demon crouching at the door. It shall..." Neil joins in:
51) 14) dialog: --. be eager for you and you will be mastered by it, but you must master it. Jacob shakes his head "no."
51) 15) dialog: How could you forget it, he made us write it on every test?
51) 20) dialog: No, but Steinbeck used it in East of Eden. That's why we were studying it.
51) 23) dialog: Why?
51) 27) dialog: He was gay?
51) 29) dialog: --And how did you know?
51) 32) dialog: No, he didn't.
51) 44) dialog: What ever happened to Sean O'Leary?
51) 51) dialog: What happened to her? Hannah holds up the yearbook.
51) 52) dialog: (continuing) She was so smart.
51) 56) dialog: Remember him? He's in L.A., too. He's trying to be a screenwriter.
51) 59) dialog: I think he just wrote this really low budget "T and A" movie. (looking back at the yearbook) It's hard, it takes time to break in. There's a bunch of people from our class in L.A. trying to be actors and stuff.
51) 64) dialog: (to Rose) Hey, "Bear," pass me a beer.
51) 66) dialog: Sorry.
51) 78) dialog: Wow. That's too bad.
51) 102) dialog: No, wait Rose, I'll admit it, I want to make a lot of money, but only if I'm doing something I really love.
51) 104) dialog: Well then... I guess it's okay. It's just- it's not for me. I'm not going to work a nine to five job like my parents.
51) 106) dialog: But we got to be more careful then that, we got to make sure that what we're doing is a conscious decision, so that we're not just wasting time.
51) 110) dialog: We're making decisions that have consequences, whether we realize it or not. Doors have already closed, we're really too old to start at the bottom in a lot of jobs.
51) 112) dialog: You know what I'm saying. We're already too old to take a job that pays like... twenty grand even if someone would hire us over a 22 year old fresh out of school.
51) 114) dialog: And that's the thing, you're making choices, too.
51) 116) dialog: Then that's the greatest success. And you're going to be able to go to the reunion on Saturday without any regrets.
51) 118) dialog: I just want to make sure that when I'm lying on my death bed I don't have any regrets, you know?
52) 0) text: Rose cleans a few plates at the sink and hands them to Hannah, who puts them into the dishwasher.
52) 1) dialog: Do you know what I would have done in high school just to so much as get him to say "hi" to me? (MORE) (CONTINUED)
52) 4) dialog: And now he practically asked me to sleep with him.
52) 6) dialog: I don't know... I think we would have done it if you hadn't come along.
52) 8) dialog: No, it's okay, I'm glad, it'll give me some time to think about it... I felt like I was in High School again. And I don't know if I liked it.
52) 10) dialog: We've always known he wasn't monogamous.
52) 12) dialog: I guess I'm not even thinking about Elizabeth.
52) 14) dialog: Yeah, I know... but I'm not sure I even care. It's almost like if I had sex with him I could somehow redeem my high school years, and put it all behind me, you know? I was so alone. (CONTINUED)
52) 21) dialog: I don't know. I don't even know if he'll try anything again. I was kind of rude to him, it was just so sudden. Tom re-enters as Hannah shuffles out into the living room
67) 0) text: Neil sits in a chair, reading. Hannah appears at the door Neil's oblivious. Hannah KNOCKS on the wood.
67) 2) dialog: I guess I'll see you in the morning? (CONTINUED)
67) 6) dialog: It's to bad about your friend Jody.
67) 8) dialog: Yeah, me too. Hannah turns to leave.
67) 10) dialog: I don't think so. Hannah hovers in the doorway.
67) 11) dialog: Do you really want to talk about this?
67) 13) dialog: --Because it really interests me and I've spent a lot of time thinking about it. Hannah moves into the patio and sits down across from Nei
67) 14) dialog: You know how you've spent the last few years reading the bible?
67) 16) dialog: Well, I've spent the last few years reading Nietzsche and Hemingway... Shaw, Zola, and... Freud-- (CONTINUED)
67) 20) dialog: And Steinbeck. Neil leans back in the wicker chair. It creaks.
67) 21) dialog: (continuing) And they were all atheists, basically trying to answer the same questions as the bible, only without God. And now Neil leans forward and speaks:
67) 23) dialog: Yeah?
67) 25) dialog: But it's not about God or the Devil.
67) 27) dialog: It's not really about God or the devil... or good and evil... it's about free will.
67) 32) dialog: And Nietzsche ended up dying of syphilis that he contracted from a prostitute.
67) 34) dialog: But they were all moral people, with strict codes of conduct. Tom appears in the doorway.
67) 37) dialog: (starting up again) Look at the way you view everything, like earlier when we were talking about getting a "real" job. I mean, you're over here talking about how no one's ever too old and about all the strength that being poor is going to give you when you're older.
67) 39) dialog: Maybe it is, but it's like I'm over here making lists of jobs I'm too old to take, and- and what I'm going to tell my parents, and trying to make sure I never look back at the experience with regret. With me it's all very thought out and... and concrete. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
67) 42) dialog: And that's the thing, you're over here, really vague and that's what God is. Maybe he does exist, he just isn't real... and if he does exist he created me so I couldn't believe in him.
67) 44) dialog: No, I'm not sure, and that's ‘cause I'm so concrete. No one can ever be sure and if you are, it's only because you're not as concrete as I am. Neil smiles at Hannah.
67) 45) dialog: You're still really searching and I think you'll find his love. It's a great feeling when you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. I just hope there's time. Hannah shakes her head.
67) 46) dialog: If God does exist, and I face him, and he condemns me, I'll spit in his face and I'll go to hell gladly. How can he condemn a person that's moral?
67) 48) dialog: Well, then I'm going to hell. And I won't be sorry, ‘cause I made the best choice I could. (CONTINUED)
67) 52) dialog: You don't understand... I can't.
67) 54) dialog: «+. Alright.
67) 56) dialog: Amen. Neil opens his eyes and releases Hannah's hand.
69) 0) text: Hannah and Neil continue their dialogue.
69) 1) dialog: It's hard, just to say it, "I don't believe in God." Like my mother might overhear me and yell at me or something. It's a hard thing to do after 12 years of Catholic schools.
69) 3) dialog: No... (CONTINUED)
69) 7) dialog: We're not going to change our opinion.
69) 9) dialog: «+. No.
69) 11) dialog: No one ever changes.
69) 13) dialog: (interrupting) Goodnight, Neil.
73) 0) text: Hannah softly plays her guitar and sings.
73) 1) dialog: (singing) Jacob, Jacob where were you? Can't you see that I'm all through?
77) 0) text: Rose sits at the kitchen table looking out the window. Hannah enters.
77) 2) dialog: What are you so happy about?
77) 6) dialog: And the reunion isn't even until tomorrow. Hannah helps herself to the pot of coffee.
77) 7) dialog: I had quite an interesting chat with Neil last night. He's a lot different than I thought.
77) 9) dialog: I don't know, it's not really that he's any smarter then I thought, but he's just... he's deeper.
77) 11) dialog: Yeah. He's a lot different than he was in high school.
77) 13) dialog: Jacob?
77) 22) dialog: What was that about?
77) 24) dialog: So she knows about... "Bear?"
83) 0) text: Tom dumps charcoal and lighter fluid into a grill, and li it up. Hannah starts to strum a few cords.
83) 1) dialog: It's not very polished... (CONTINUED)
83) 4) dialog: (continuing) I wrote it this morning. Hannah starts to sing a comedic folk song about the "Limb cheese incident." And it's hysterical and Hannah keeps singing and people a laughing.
84) 10) dialog: Hey, you want to see the dress I brought for the reunion? Tom sighs.
85) 2) dialog: But it's not about good and evil. There's no such thing!
85) 4) dialog: I don't know... High school.
85) 11) dialog: When was the last time you read East of Eden? High school? Neil doesn't answer.
85) 12) dialog: I'm just saying, that's not why Morton had us memorize it.
85) 14) dialog: Morton didn't care about God. He was an atheist
85) 16) dialog: I talked to him about it. He took that quote from Steinbeck's East of Eden.
85) 18) dialog: Steinbeck found several different translations of that one verse in Genesis. And he found a discrepancy in the final part of the verse, "you will be mastered by it, but you must master it."
85) 22) dialog: One translation said, "thou shalt rule over him." Which is a promise from God, that man shall rule over evil.
85) 24) dialog: But there is a difference.
85) 26) dialog: He found another translation that said, "Do thou rule over him." And that's an order from God, for man to rule over evil. Neither one really gives anyone any choice, you see? So Steinbeck went back to the original hebrew and found one word...
85) 29) dialog: Timshel... and it meant, "thou mayest." And this is very different, it's not an order or a promise, it's a choice, and it's our choice. We may... but we also may not. It's an offering of free will, and it's about individual responsibility and the invention of consciousness. And that's what Morton was talking about. He was trying to tell us that we had a choice, and not just between good and evil, but with everything. Tom repeats the word back to himself:
85) 35) dialog: ++. Yeah.
85) 37) dialog: What? It's not a bad word. It doesn't mean I'm not moral. Some of the brightest most moral people in the world are atheists.
85) 39) dialog: What? Everyone stares at her.
85) 40) dialog: I just have to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.
86) 0) text: The off screen sound of a toilet flushing and... Hannah exits the bathroom. Jacob's behind her and he wrap his arms around her.
86) 2) dialog: You know you're married? Jacob grabs Hannah's hand and pulls her into the guest bedroom. (CONTINUED)
86) 6) dialog: That doesn't make it-- Jacob silences her with another kiss and Hannah starts to kiss him back. Jacob locks the door and pulls Hannah over to the bed.
86) 7) dialog: I don't know if this is such--
88) 0) text: Jacob and Hannah make-out on the bed. Hannah looks stiff a little awkward. But not Jacob.
91) 0) text: Jacob runs his hands over Hannah's shirt and starts to unbutton it.
91) 1) dialog: I don't know about this, everyone is right down-- (CONTINUED)
94) 2) dialog: It's "Wonder Woman!" Everyone laughs.
94) 7) dialog: But it's only nine o'clock. (CONTINUED)
98) 0) text: Elizabeth sits at the base of the porch smoking a cigaret staring off into the street. Hannah exits the house and sees Elizabeth.
98) 1) dialog: Can I bum a cigarette from you? (CONTINUED)
98) 4) dialog: So... did you get a lot of nice things shopping?
98) 6) dialog: Oh... well... what'd you get? A dress for tomorrow?
98) 8) dialog: It must be really exciting living in "the Big Apple."
98) 10) dialog: You're not having a very good time here, are you?
98) 12) dialog: Well at least people will remember you. Elizabeth turns toward Hannah, says:
98) 14) dialog: Hey, at least it's something. (CONTINUED)
98) 17) dialog: --So is to true that New Yorkers are the rudest people in the world? I mean, I'm just wondering if you were always this rude or if it was New York that made you such a bitch.
98) 19) dialog: You know, you got a hell of nerve. You come in here and are completely asocial to everyone. You got what all the rest of us dreamed about. You got nothing to complain about.
98) 21) dialog: You should be so happy. And now Elizabeth turns back to face Hannah, and talks venomously:
98) 23) dialog: But... Jacob is so successful. He's everything people thought he'd be, and more. Elizabeth shakes her head.
98) 25) dialog: Then, why do you keep doing it?
98) 29) dialog: I don't--
108) 0) text: Hannah softly plays her guitar. Elizabeth storms past. Neil enters, following Elizabeth.
108) 2) dialog: Good night, Tom. Tom looks at Hannah, smiles but says nothing. He continue up the stairs.
110) 0) text: Neil stands in the middle of the room ironing a pair of pants. Hannah appears in the doorway wearing a revealing night gown.
110) 1) dialog: I'm impressed. Can you cook, too? Neil turns around, startled. He notices Hannah's attire.
110) 3) dialog: I'm so glad I got a chance to spend some time with you, Neil. You've really surprised me.
110) 5) dialog: I always wondered what would happen to guys like you. I guess I just figured you'd be washed up after high school. I guess I wanted to believe it. I guess I had to... ‘cause I was just so miserable. Neil stops ironing and sits down next to Hannah.
110) 6) dialog: That's the only way I made it; thinking you guys were so immature or- or not as smart as I was or... or somehow not as deep. Like there was a correlation between being unpopular in high school and being successful later in life. Like the two somehow go together. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
110) 10) dialog: No, maybe not unpopular, but I was just such a nothing. No one even knew who I was.
110) 12) dialog: Yeah, and that was the first surprise. But Jacob didn't remember me. And that's the thing, he's pretty much what I thought, you know? He's successful and all, I mean we all knew he would be, but- but he hasn't really changed.
110) 14) dialog: That's why it's so good to see you, and see that you actually have some substance in your life. Not that this means I agree with anything you believe in, 'cause I don't, but... but I do respect the hell out of you. Neil smiles and hugs Hannah and Hannah inhales deeply.
112) 0) text: Hannah lies on the couch, asleep. In the darkness a FIGURE appears, moving toward Hannah. The figure kneels down next to Hannah and kisses her on t lips and she starts to wake up. It's Jacob. She smiles wh she sees him in front of her. Jacob kisses her again and kisses him back but then she sits up and moves away.
112) 1) dialog: No, I'm not going to do this.
112) 3) dialog: I'm not going to do this.
112) 8) dialog: If you had so much as said "hi" to me in high school, I would have been ecstatic for a year.
112) 10) dialog: God. This is surreal. I never thought I'd get this chance. And I'm saying "no." I can, you know? I never thought I'd be able to. But I can.
112) 12) dialog: It's incredible, 'cause it's the only way I would've ever really known. Now Jacob's growing a little agitated at Hannah's stallin
112) 14) dialog: I thought I could somehow redeem my high school years by sleeping with you. But it doesn't. High school was High school. It's over.
112) 16) dialog: I'm sorry that you were the one that got caught in the middle of this. But can't you at least see what's happening, and be happy for me? (CONTINUED)
112) 20) dialog: If I were to say "yes," it would make the last ten years of my life a complete waste. It's not about going back and trying to fix it, ‘cause you can't, it's about accepting it and moving forward. And now Jacob's pulling away.
112) 21) dialog: (continuing) I'm over you and I can finally put high school behind me. It's not about you, you know?
112) 23) dialog: It's about me, and who I am. And now... I'm just not interested. I don't know if I could have said "no" even two days ago or... or two minutes ago. But I can now, and it feels so good.
112) 25) dialog: I'm so sorry. It's not you.
122) 0) text: Tom and Neil still wait. Hannah and Rose enter and Tom looks at Neil and nods and gets up and goes to Rose.
126) 0) text: Tom enters, sees Neil and Hannah sitting on the couch. Th immediately rise.
126) 5) dialog: Tom, what's going on?
129) 4) dialog: They're having an affair? Hannah's sitting across from them, in the recliner. Tom nods. (CONTINUED)
129) 11) dialog: Tom, I...
129) 13) dialog: --I'm sorry.
129) 15) dialog: --No.
129) 17) dialog: Yes. He did... He fucked her in Walsh's office, when you guys were in Sister Susan's office. She followed him in there and... they did it. It was supposed to be me. Tom closes his eyes as it sinks in and falls back in the couch. (CONTINUED)

132) 0) text: Tom and Neil still sit on the couch. Hannah still sits across from them.

132) 7) dialog: Don't. Don't just retreat to religion.
132) 9) dialog: This is what Morton was talking about! "Timshel."
132) 11) dialog: Tom, you got to choose for yourself. You don't have to do what Neil says. You don't have to do what Rose says. You don't have to do what your parents said. You should do what you want.
132) 13) dialog: (to Neil) If God exists, fine, but let him find out for himself.
132) 17) dialog: But for you it's different, for you it's a choice. You're choosing for Tom.
132) 19) dialog: No, it's not. If two people do the same thing for different reasons, it's not the same thing. Neil thinks for a moment, staring at Hannah.
132) 21) dialog: Maybe it's not, maybe it's a paradox. But maybe trying is all anyone can do. And the door opens and Rose appears in the doorway. Elizabeth enters with the suitcases and exits out the fro door without saying a word.
