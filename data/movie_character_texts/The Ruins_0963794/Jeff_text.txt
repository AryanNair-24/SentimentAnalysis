A long moment of silence. No one can meet Amy's eyes. Finally, VERY QUIETLY:
22) 30) dialog: Another hour or so. Then we'll all have a sip. Okay? Amy can see that she has no choice. She gives a grudging nod, and Jeff slides the bottle into his knapsack. JEFF (cont'd) We have to get organized. Now. While we're still fresh. We'll have to stay out of the sun, spend as much time as possible in the tents. We'll have to--
22) 37) dialog: They keep coming. More and more of them. They're all armed, and the bald one sends them out along the clearing. They're surrounding us. Amy, Stacy and Eric struggle to absorb this. Finally:
22) 39) dialog: It's got something to do with the hill, I think. Once you step on it, you're not allowed off. Something like that. They won't step on it themselves, but now that we're here, they won't let us leave. So we have to figure out a way to survive till someone comes and finds-us.

Mathias is knotting the rope tightly around his chest. Amy returns, carrying an oil lamp, a box of matches. Everyone watches as Jeff crouches to light the lamp. Then rises, turns toward Mathias, looks at him closely. JEFF (cont'd) You sure? Mathias nods, takes the lamp, steps to the edge of the ho Jeff and Eric move to the windlass; they position themsel at the hand crank, leaning into it, so the rope goes taut Mathias girds himself, steps out over the hole. He dangle there for a moment, hanging beneath the sawhorse, the windlass GROANING on its mount. Then Jeff and Eric begin reverse the crank, letting the rope slowly spool out.

24) 8) dialog: Ready? She nods, but doesn't relinquish her grip on the sawhorse JEFF (cont'd) You have to let go, Stacy. For a moment, it doesn't seem like she'll be able to, but then--with a visible act of will--she does, and they slow begin to let the rope out, dropping her into the shaft.

Stacy's b goes rigid, and Eric takes her hand again. Once more, we see the tendril through the incision: dark with her blood Jeff reaches in and slowly pulls the vine from her body.

She starts dig through it, casually at first, but then with growing intensity, throwing T-shirts and jeans and shorts aside, probing deeply into the pile. Suddenly she goes still. Staring. Amid the sodden mass of clothing sits a knife in a small scabbard. As Stacy crouches there, the vines start to RUSTLE, a rippling motion passing across them, as. if a wind were sweeping the hillside. Stacy watches with a look of horro it looks like the pelt of some giant animal, shaking itse When it finally stops, she bends, reaching for the knife.
