0) 4) dialog: Kinda hard, isn't it? This is what we do to ourselves on a daily basis. We weigh ourselves down until we can't even move. And make no mistake - Moving is living. 2.
0) 8) dialog: Now, I'm going to set your backpack on fire. What do you want to take out of it? Photos? Photos are for people who can't remember. Drink some gingko and let the photos burn. In fact let everything burn and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing. (a beat of emphasis) It's kind of exhilarating isn't it? That is how I approach every day.
1) 7) dialog: Excuse me?
1) 16) dialog: Oh... No. Um, no thank you.
8) 7) dialog: This is not an assessment of your productivity. It's important not to personalize this.
8) 12) dialog: Steve, I want you to review this packet. Take it seriously. I think you're going to find a lot of answers in there.
8) 17) dialog: Look, anybody who ever built an empire, or changed the world, sat where you are now. And it's because they sat there that they were able to do it.
8) 20) dialog: I'm going to need your key card.
8) 25) dialog: Take the day. Put together your personal things. Talk to your co- workers. Tomorrow, go out and get some exercise. Go for a jog. Give yourself routines and pretty soon you'll find your legs.
8) 30) dialog: Don't worry. We'll be in touch soon. This is just the beginning.
15) 5) dialog: You have me in a Dodge Stratus in Kansas City.
15) 10) dialog: 
15) 15) dialog: Fair enough. Any other messages?
15) 19) dialog: Well done.
15) 24) dialog: GoalQuest twenty?
18) 5) dialog: Talk about burying the lead.
18) 10) dialog: I... ah, fuck...
19) 5) dialog: Twenty minutes from boarding into a world of bliss.
19) 9) dialog: No kidding?
19) 13) dialog: I thought you needed me everywhere. 11.
19) 18) dialog: I don't know why you ever bring me in. Wherever I go, the money follows. Let me plant seeds, they'll grow to Oaks.
19) 23) dialog: What are we talking about here?
19) 28) dialog: That's me, hanging up on you.
24) 3) dialog: 
25) 7) dialog: Hey Kara.
25) 11) dialog: Just fine. You? The kids?
26) 3) dialog: Couldn't be better.
26) 7) dialog: 
26) 16) dialog: Yeah.
26) 20) dialog: Why?
26) 25) dialog: How is Julie?
26) 29) dialog: Isolated? I'm surrounded.
26) 33) dialog: Did he?
26) 37) dialog: That place is a shit hole. No one stays there.
26) 41) dialog: I'm going to try my best.
27) 3) dialog: You're satisfied with Maestro?
27) 7) dialog: They're stingy with their miles. I like Hertz.
27) 12) dialog: Maestro doesn't instant check out. I like to park and go.
27) 16) dialog: Funny, you don't seem like a girl who needs directions.
27) 20) dialog: The new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad.
27) 25) dialog: Yes.
27) 30) dialog: Never have available upgrades.
27) 35) dialog: (I love you) I'm Ryan.
27) 39) dialog: So are you going to join me?
28) 3) dialog: (grabs one of Alex's cards) Maplewood Card? How dare you bring that into this palace.
28) 7) dialog: They got you with the cookies?
28) 11) dialog: There's actually an industry term for that. It's a mixture of faux and homey. It's faumey.
28) 17) dialog: Concierge Key. Yeah.
28) 21) dialog: Graphite. I was pretty excited the day that puppy came in.
28) 25) dialog: 
28) 30) dialog: That's a personal question.
28) 34) dialog: 
28) 40) dialog: You have no idea.
28) 46) dialog: Let's just say I've got a number in mind and I haven't hit it yet.
28) 51) dialog: I hope it doesn't cheapen our relationship.
28) 55) dialog: There's nothing cheap about loyalty.
29) 4) dialog: I really have to start throwing these out.
30) 4) dialog: Good call on the towel rack.
30) 8) dialog: I was improvising.
30) 12) dialog: We got to do this again.
30) 19) dialog: I'm in Newark on the 12th, Madesto on the 13th, Oklahoma City on the 15th.
30) 23) dialog: No, but I'll be in Florida by the 20th.
30) 27) dialog: Ft. Lauderdale.
30) 31) dialog: Forty minutes.
30) 37) dialog: I think that's the lady like thing to do.
41) 5) dialog: (doesn't know his name) Hi...
41) 9) dialog: Yeah, sorry I couldn't be there.
41) 13) dialog: It's fine. Really. I'll go with the majority.
41) 18) dialog: 
42) 7) dialog: Hey yourself.
42) 12) dialog: Thanks. Hope it wasn't a bother.
42) 18) dialog: It's my sister. She's getting married. Haven't met the guy yet.
42) 23) dialog: I know, right?
42) 28) dialog: Hey, you want to come over tonight?
42) 33) dialog: Oh, that's... that's great.
42) 37) dialog: That's okay... I' think I'll settle in.
44) 52) dialog: 
45) 3) dialog: Tell me you're not taking this seriously.
45) 7) dialog: It doesn't make any sense. It's...
45) 12) dialog: There's a methodology to what I do. A reason why it works.
45) 16) dialog: Who are you taking off the road? 29.
45) 22) dialog: Okay, what we do here is brutal and leaves people devastated, but there's a dignity to the way I do it.
45) 31) dialog: Yeah, why don't you come in.
45) 39) dialog: 
45) 46) dialog: 
45) 52) dialog: She's going to be doing this on a regular basis. You don't want to know if she can fire somebody?
45) 56) dialog: My dog could fire Ned.
45) 66) dialog: Who the hell are you?
45) 70) dialog: My future? I don't know you. The only person who can fire me is Craig Gregory.
45) 74) dialog: Handle what? Handle me? Mr. Gregory hired me and he's the only one who can fire me. I'm going to talk to him.
45) 80) dialog: You can't follow me... You're on a computer screen. Remember?
45) 86) dialog: Try again. Fire me.
45) 90) dialog: Actually, you didn't. Now, fire me.
45) 97) dialog: I'm fired?
45) 101) dialog: 
45) 106) dialog: Why?
45) 110) dialog: You never know why. Why doesn't matter. 32.
45) 115) dialog: I'm going to spend my energy on suing you if you don't give me a reason that you're firing me.
45) 119) dialog: Oh, so you're firing me without grounds.
45) 127) dialog: Personally? (quiet and calm) This is the most personal situation you will ever enter. So before you try to revolutionize my business, I'd like to know that you actually know my business.
46) 7) dialog: Am I the only one who sees that by automating our own business, we're making ourselves irrelevant.
46) 15) dialog: I'm not... I'm not a dinosaur.
46) 19) dialog: What do I know about what happens around here? Have Ferguson do it.
46) 24) dialog: No.
46) 28) dialog: Excuse me. I just don't think a MySpace page qualifies you to rewire an entire company.
46) 32) dialog: I'm not a fucking tour guide. 34.
46) 44) dialog: Yes. Alone.
47) 4) dialog: Huh.
49) 5) dialog: That's exactly what it is. Luggage. (off of Natalie's look) You know how much time you lose by checking in?
49) 10) dialog: Thirty five minutes per flight. I travel two hundred seventy days a year. That makes one hundred fifty seven hours... That's Seven Days. (points to her luggage) You ready to throw away a whole week on that?
50) 7) dialog: Bingo. Asians.
50) 13) dialog: Never get behind people travelling with infants. I've never seen a stroller collapse in less than twenty minutes.
50) 16) dialog: Old people are worse. Their bodies are littered with hidden metal and they never seem to appreciate how little time they have left on Earth.
50) 19) dialog: Five words. Randomly selected for additional screening.
50) 23) dialog: Asians. They're light packers, treasure efficiency, and have a thing for slip-on shoes. God love'em.
50) 27) dialog: I'm like my mother. I stereotype. It's faster.
51) 3) dialog: Are you upset at your laptop?
51) 7) dialog: Fats Domino had a lighter touch.
51) 11) dialog: What are you working on so furiously?
51) 15) dialog: Who is it for? 38.
51) 20) dialog: Natalie, what is it, you think we do here?
51) 24) dialog: That's what we're selling. But it's not what we're doing.
51) 28) dialog: Our job is to make limbo tolerable - To ferry wounded souls across the river of dread and humiliation to the point at which hope's bright shore is dimly visible...
52) 3) dialog: 
52) 8) dialog: Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you.
53) 5) dialog: 
53) 11) dialog: You know, I didn't know what was appropriate...
53) 16) dialog: This sounds like a trick.
53) 21) dialog: When am I going to see you? 40.
53) 26) dialog: 
53) 31) dialog: How long is your layover in O'Hare? They've got multiples into SDF... Think you could push?
55) 4) dialog: (to desk girl) Ryan Bingham, from CTC.
57) 3) dialog: All you have to do today is watch and listen. When I talk about the strategy packet. You hand them one of these...
57) 8) dialog: Everything important in life comes with a packet.
57) 14) dialog: Thank you for coming by. As you're probably well aware, this is a tough economic climate and your company is not immune.
57) 17) dialog: While I wish I was here with better news, the reason you and I are meeting is this is your final week of employment here.
57) 20) dialog: This is not a time to look for blame. Your position simply no longer exists.
57) 23) dialog: I understand why you are saying these things.
57) 27) dialog: It's perfectly natural to feel this way. I want you to take the next week to explore this strategy packet...
57) 30) dialog: Fill out the skill set work sheet... Use the hopes and dreams diagram... And the tree of aspirations.
57) 33) dialog: 
57) 37) dialog: The answers are all in there.
57) 63) dialog: Your children's admiration is important to you?
57) 67) dialog: 
57) 73) dialog: I'm not a shrink, Bob. I'm a wake up call. You know why kids love athletes?
57) 77) dialog: No, that's why we love athletes. Kids love them because they follow their dreams.
57) 81) dialog: But you can cook.
57) 88) dialog: Your resume says you minored in French Culinary Arts. Most students work the frier at KFC. You bussed tables at Il Picatorre to support yourself. Then you got out of college and started working here. (looks up at Bob) How much did they first pay you to give up on your dreams?
57) 93) dialog: At what point were you going to stop and go back to what made you happy?
57) 96) dialog: Do you believe in fate, Bob?
57) 100) dialog: Yeah. You know, the mysterious ways in which we wind up doing the things we were meant to do.
57) 105) dialog: Exactly. Well, I think fate is telling you to do something, Bob.
57) 108) dialog: I see guys who work for the same company their entire lives. Clock in. Clock out. Never a moment of happiness. (pauses for effect) Not everyone gets this kind of opportunity.
57) 112) dialog: The chance for rebirth. If not for yourself... Do it for your kids.
58) 10) dialog: You should look into it - The promotions are great...
60) 3) dialog: You okay?
60) 11) dialog: Our expense account allots for forty dollars each on dinner. I plan on grabbing every mile I can.
60) 16) dialog: Your really want to know?
60) 21) dialog: I don't spend a nickel, if I can help it, unless it somehow profits my mileage account. I'm not talking hotel rooms and rental cars either, but internet services, cell phone, music downloads, teleflorists. The works. I shop them according to the miles they pay and I pit them against each other for the most value. 47.
60) 26) dialog: No, it's not like that... The miles are the goal.
60) 30) dialog: Let's just say I've got a number in mind and haven't hit it yet.
60) 34) dialog: I'd rather not.
60) 39) dialog: It's ten million miles.
60) 43) dialog: Pi is just a number.
60) 50) dialog: I'd be the seventh person to do it. More people have walked on the moon.
60) 55) dialog: Lifetime Exec Platinum status. You get to meet the Chief Pilot, Maynard Finch. And... They put your name on the side of a plane.
60) 59) dialog: Now, who's stereotyping?
60) 63) dialog: And why do you suppose that's singular to men?
62) 5) dialog: 
62) 12) dialog: Man alive.
63) 9) dialog: My sister is cooky. She thinks this is charming... Like the gnome thing. 50.
63) 14) dialog: She should be so lucky to visit Lambert Field. The Wright Brothers flew through there... (points out the conical
63) 22) dialog: Why she wants dozens of reminders of all the places she hasn't been is beyond me.
63) 26) dialog: Look - Before Lindbergh could cross the Atlantic, he took off from one of those runways... Ever wondered why they call it the Spirit of St. Louis?
64) 9) dialog: Sometimes, they just need to vent.
66) 3) dialog: People say these things all the time. It comes with the trade.
66) 7) dialog: Sure. People are always saying crazy stuff. They get worked up.
66) 12) dialog: (not quite sure) I think that's a good sign.
66) 16) dialog: No... it's just talk.
66) 20) dialog: I mean, no, nothing good can come of that, but I don't think you should worry about it.
66) 23) dialog: This is the job. Taking people at their most fragile moment and setting them adrift.
70) 3) dialog: Okay. This is where it gets a little difficult, but stay with me. You have a new backpack... but this time, I want you to fill it with people. Start with casual acquaintances, people around the office, friends of friends and work your way to the people you trust with your most intimate secrets. Now move into family members - cousins, aunts, and uncles. Get your sisters and your brothers and you parents. Get them all in that backpack. And finally your husband or wife or boyfriend or girlfriend. Get them in their too. 55.
70) 7) dialog: Don't worry. I'm not going to ask you to light it on fire.
70) 10) dialog: Feel the weight of that bag. Make no mistake, your relationships are the heaviest components of your life. Feel the straps cutting into your shoulders. All those negotiations and arguments and secrets and compromises.
70) 13) dialog: Now set that bag down.
70) 16) dialog: You don't need to carry all that weight.
70) 19) dialog: Some animals were meant to carry each other. To live symbiotically over a lifetime. Star-crossed lovers. Monogamous swans. We are not one of those animals.
70) 22) dialog: The slower we move, the faster we die. We are not swans. We're sharks.
74) 8) dialog: Is that so bizarre?
74) 12) dialog: I don't see the value.
74) 15) dialog: Sell it to me.
74) 19) dialog: Sell me marriage.
74) 23) dialog: Pff... 57.
74) 28) dialog: How many stabile marriages do you know?
74) 32) dialog: I'm surrounded by people to talk to. I doubt that will change.
75) 6) dialog: Starting when I was twelve, we moved each one of my grandparents into a nursing facility. My parents went the same way.
75) 10) dialog: 
75) 14) dialog: Just saying - There's options.
75) 17) dialog: 
75) 24) dialog: Oh, hey... I...
75) 28) dialog: Hi. Alex this is Natalie. Natalie, this is my... friend, Alex.
76) 6) dialog: 
76) 18) dialog: You did?
76) 22) dialog: To Nebraska.
76) 32) dialog: It's alright. None taken.
76) 43) dialog: At a certain point, you stop with the deadlines.
76) 51) dialog: Well done.
76) 60) dialog: The bill?
76) 65) dialog: I'm not sure if...
76) 69) dialog: Right.
77) 8) dialog: 
77) 15) dialog: ... We were going to hit that party for the tech conference in the hotel.
77) 25) dialog: I mean, I don't know if... More money than they know These guy put on a quite a what to do with... party...
78) 8) dialog: It's going to be fine.
79) 4) dialog: 
79) 29) dialog: Think she'll be okay?
80) 6) dialog: That's why I don't have a "back home".
80) 11) dialog: You know about the back pack?
80) 15) dialog: You did? 66.
80) 20) dialog: Did it bother you?
80) 24) dialog: I don't hate people. I'm not exactly a hermit.
80) 28) dialog: I don't think it's even that... I... First time I ever flew, I was sixteen.
80) 32) dialog: (smiles, continues story) It was January and I had just gotten my driver's license. The lakes were frozen over, so we piled into my car and hit the ice to do donuts. When, out of nowhere, I hit a soft spot and the hood of my car tilted up and I was sinking backwards into the water.
80) 36) dialog: I literally started to drown. Within a few seconds, I black out. Then, I wake up in the sky. I'm in a helicopter, laying on a stretcher. This guy in a uniform is telling me I was minutes away from dying.
80) 41) dialog: Right? (relives it for a second) So just as we're hovering over the hospital, I sit up. And from there, I could see the whole western horizon. We'd been flying twenty minutes. Twenty minutes to reach a city I'd thought of as remote, halfway across the state... a foreign capital.
80) 45) dialog: I don't know what originally sparked the back pack. I probably needed to be alone. Recently, I've been thinking that maybe I needed to empty the bag before I knew what to put back in.
84) 3) dialog: Hey, you're up...
84) 7) dialog: 
84) 12) dialog: Yeah, all right... Just leave the money on the dresser.
84) 18) dialog: I can't remember the last time I enjoyed spending time with someone as much as you.
85) 7) dialog: Just relax. It was nice to see you cut loose. So, did you wake him up or slip out?
85) 11) dialog: This morning... Your new friend. Did you wake him for an awkward good bye or just slip out so he could feel like a whore.
85) 16) dialog: Protocol is always tricky.
85) 20) dialog: Sometimes there really is no right thing to do.
86) 6) dialog: Had to skip town early to make a meeting.
86) 10) dialog: Chicago.
86) 14) dialog: I don't know. We just don't have that kind of relationship.
86) 18) dialog: It's, you know. Casual.
86) 22) dialog: It works for us.
86) 26) dialog: Never thought about it. What's going on here?
86) 30) dialog: (a good lie) No.
86) 35) dialog: It's simple, you know that moment when you look into someone's eyes and you feel them looking right into your soul, and the whole world goes quiet for a second.
86) 39) dialog: Right. Well, I don't.
86) 44) dialog: Oh come on, I'm just dicking around. I need your help...
86) 48) dialog: A chance to what?
86) 52) dialog: Natalie, your definition of "real" is going to evolve as you get older...
86) 56) dialog: Bullshit philosophy?
86) 60) dialog: No, it's simply a life choice. 72.
86) 65) dialog: Wow. Big words.
86) 69) dialog: Well, screw you too.
86) 74) dialog: I don't have a gauntlet of...
86) 77) dialog: ... Fuck!
91) 3) dialog: These Detroit guys can be tough. They've been getting hammered. Don't get distracted. Stick to the simple stuff. Get the packet in their hands and get them out the door.
94) 8) dialog: What's going on here? 74.
94) 13) dialog: We could use a little more time.
94) 17) dialog: This is a real company, Craig. We're here to do some damage.
94) 23) dialog: Just give me a minute to prepare and get my things together.
94) 28) dialog: She's hardly ready for this.
94) 32) dialog: (re: the webcam) This is a whole other animal...
95) 3) dialog: Just remember, don't apologize. Don't tell them how hard this is for you. Today is one of the worst days they will ever have. What we feel doesn't even compare.
95) 7) dialog: Just keep it professional. You're going to do fine.
97) 58) dialog: You did good.
97) 61) dialog: You okay? Want me to take over.
98) 4) dialog: ... We just got out here. That was one place. I think we need to try a few more...
98) 11) dialog: He thought you did a great job. You did - I was real proud of you.
98) 15) dialog: We're being pulled off the road.
98) 20) dialog: That's what it looks like.
100) 5) dialog: It's alright. I understand.
100) 9) dialog: It's fine.
100) 13) dialog: What do you mean?
100) 17) dialog: Oh, I don't know.
100) 25) dialog: Grabbing another flight... Something I need to take care of. I'll see you in, uh... at home.
101) 8) dialog: There'll be plenty of time for all that. (directing the photo) One more foot to the left.
101) 13) dialog: I'm fine, I guess. (directing the photo) Okay great... walk away.
101) 19) dialog: Think so?
101) 24) dialog: How do you like Wisconsin in February?
101) 33) dialog: Northern Wisconsin.
101) 39) dialog: What? I haven't even...
101) 43) dialog: Why not?
101) 47) dialog: I'm being serious.
101) 51) dialog: Well... Yeah.
101) 55) dialog: It's not like I know her that well.
101) 59) dialog: Look. You know. I'm not the wedding type. But for the first time in my life... I don't want to be that guy, alone with his drink. I want a dancing partner. I want a plus one. And if you can stomach it, I'd like it to be you. 82.
101) 65) dialog: Really?
101) 69) dialog: I feel like we should kiss or something.
104) 4) dialog: (to the CHECK-IN LADY) Are you available? 83.
105) 6) dialog: Kara...
105) 9) dialog: Alex, this is my sister Kara.
105) 17) dialog: Kara, what are you doing at a hotel?
105) 21) dialog: You're not staying at the house?
105) 26) dialog: Oh, okay.
105) 31) dialog: Um...
105) 39) dialog: So, the rehearsal dinner?
106) 3) dialog: There's a packet.
106) 7) dialog: Um, I love you?
107) 16) dialog: Me? You're the one getting married.
107) 26) dialog: I brought those photos you were asking for... 86.
107) 35) dialog: There were quite a few already up there. Almost couldn't find room.
107) 39) dialog: What gave you the idea to do something so...
107) 60) dialog: Sounds nice.
107) 65) dialog: Must be a nice development.
107) 70) dialog: Nice.
107) 75) dialog: That's a nice touch.
107) 79) dialog: That bit at the end about promise... I like it. 88.
107) 85) dialog: I gave it up.
107) 90) dialog: No.
107) 94) dialog: Not really. No.
108) 9) dialog: I don't think that's for sleeping.
108) 19) dialog: You sure?
108) 24) dialog: Jim seems like a good guy.
108) 31) dialog: Hey, Julie, I was thinking... with dad not being... Well, I didn't know if you had someone to walk you down the aisle...
108) 38) dialog: Oh... Oh, great. Just wanted to make sure you were covered. So I should get there at...
109) 3) dialog: Hey Kara?
109) 7) dialog: Can you believe she's getting married already? She's just a kid.
109) 11) dialog: Oh.
110) 7) dialog: Are we really doing this?
111) 3) dialog: I took geography in here.
111) 8) dialog: No. You?
112) 5) dialog: Point guard. Don't act so surprised.
113) 3) dialog: My first fight. 92.
113) 8) dialog: Got my ass kicked.
114) 3) dialog: This is where we used to go to make out.
115) 6) dialog: (to the team) Go Cougars!
115) 10) dialog: (checks caller ID) It's Kara.
116) 6) dialog: What's wrong? What happened?
116) 10) dialog: Yeah, of course...
118) 3) dialog: What happened?
118) 7) dialog: Today?
118) 11) dialog: What do you want me to do?
118) 15) dialog: You want me to talk to him? 94.
118) 20) dialog: I haven't been to bat. I haven't been in the dugout.
118) 24) dialog: I tell people how to avoid commitment.
118) 29) dialog: It's a philosophy.
118) 33) dialog: Hey, it might have helped you.
119) 5) dialog: Oh, hey Jim. 95.
119) 10) dialog: Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff.
119) 14) dialog: Kara mentioned you were having some... thoughts?
119) 19) dialog: Okay. What makes you say that today?
119) 26) dialog: The point?
119) 30) dialog: 
119) 36) dialog: That's true...
119) 40) dialog: Well, it's hard to define "try".
119) 45) dialog: Jim, I'm not going to lie. Marriage can be a pain in the ass. And you're kind of right - All of this is just stuff on the way to your eventual demise.
119) 54) dialog: We are all on running clocks that cannot be slowed down or paused and they all lead to the same place. Some guys leave marks that last beyond their own mortality. Not guys like you and me... But some. But even those footprints disappear.
119) 58) dialog: I'm not the guy you'd normally want to talk to about all this stuff... But think about it - your favorite memories. The greatest moments of your life? Were you alone? 97.
119) 63) dialog: I don't want to sound like a Hallmark card, but... Life? It's better with company.
119) 66) dialog: Come to think of it... Last night, the night before your wedding, when all this shit was circling through your head... Weren't you two sleeping in separate rooms?
119) 71) dialog: Kind of lonely?
119) 75) dialog: Hey. Everybody needs a copilot.
119) 80) dialog: Thanks.
119) 84) dialog: It's not good... Emotional.
119) 88) dialog: (twinkle in his eye) Go get her. 98.
120) 18) dialog: Hi, I'm Ryan.
120) 22) dialog: Oh, hey!
121) 5) dialog: You're just going to have to come and visit.
121) 9) dialog: Same guy. Just one address.
121) 15) dialog: ... I'm lonely.
123) 5) dialog: You don't actually call them that.
123) 9) dialog: Really? I can't imagine why.
123) 13) dialog: Are they actually on line, right now?
124) 3) dialog: This is ridiculous. 101.
128) 6) dialog: Last year, I flew three hundred fifty thousand miles. The moon is only two fifty.
128) 9) dialog: Imagine for a second that you're carrying a backpack... I want you to feel the straps on your shoulders... You feel them?
128) 13) dialog: Now, I want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your life. Start with the little things.
128) 16) dialog: The... um... The stuff in drawers and on shelves.
128) 19) dialog: Excuse me.
134) 5) dialog: Surprise.
137) 3) dialog: How could you lie to me?
138) 5) dialog: What do you mean? I wanted to see you. I didn't know you had a family - Why didn't you tell me that?
138) 9) dialog: Try to help me understand. What is it you signed up for?
138) 17) dialog: I'm an escape?
138) 21) dialog: I'm a parenthesis?
138) 28) dialog: I thought I was a part of your real life.
140) 6) dialog: Yeah, right, you got me in 2C?
140) 10) dialog: What's got you so fucking happy?
141) 8) dialog: Oh no...
141) 25) dialog: You know how many times I've thought about this moment? Played out the conversation I'd have with you right here.
141) 30) dialog: You know, I... I can't remember.
141) 35) dialog: I'm from here.
142) 6) dialog: Oh, how did you know it was me?
142) 10) dialog: Oh. I'd like to transfer some of my miles. Can you open up an account under Jim and Julie Miller?
142) 14) dialog: How many miles would it take to circle the globe?
142) 18) dialog: Sounds perfect.
142) 23) dialog: (to the airline operator) I'm going to have to call you right back.
142) 28) dialog: I got tied up in... personal stuff. What's going on?
142) 37) dialog: No, I fire dozens of people a day.
142) 41) dialog: Fuck.
142) 47) dialog: They're all depressed. We're firing them.
142) 51) dialog: No, I don't remember anything. Of course they're upset. You never think that...
142) 56) dialog: No, nothing that stands out.
142) 62) dialog: Just like that?
142) 70) dialog: She say where she was going?
142) 74) dialog: I should give her a call.
142) 82) dialog: I'm fine. What about video conferencing?
142) 86) dialog: How long are you sending me out?
