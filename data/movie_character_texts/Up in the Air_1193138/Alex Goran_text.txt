27) 14) dialog: Hertz doesn't guarantee Navigation.
27) 18) dialog: I hate asking for directions. That's why I get a Nav.

53) 9) dialog: You haven't called.
53) 14) dialog: Ryan, I'm not some waitress you banged in a snow storm. The word "Appropriate" has no place in our collective vocabulary. I'm the woman you don't have to worry about.
53) 18) dialog: Next time you're worried about manners - Don't. If you want to call - Call. Just think of me as yourself... only with a vagina.

76) 26) dialog: You'll do plenty.
76) 32) dialog: It's alright. None taken.
76) 36) dialog: Life can underwhelm you that way.
76) 41) dialog: It doesn't work that way.
76) 45) dialog: They can be a little counterproductive.
76) 49) dialog: (my generation?) It was our pleasure.
76) 55) dialog: You really thought this guy was the one. 61.
76) 71) dialog: Huh, let me think for a sec. (mulls it over) Well, by the time you're thirty four, all the physical requirements are pretty much out the window. I mean you secretly prey he'll be taller than you.

76) 79) dialog: Wants kids. Healthy enough to play catch with his future son one day.
76) 82) dialog: Please let him earn more than I do. That doesn't make sense now, but believe me, it will one day. Otherwise it's just a recipe for disaster.
76) 91) dialog: Tried it. We're no picnic ourselves.
76) 97) dialog: You're young. Right now you see settling as some sort of failure.
76) 101) dialog: Don't worry, by the time someone is right for you, it won't feel like settling... And the only person left to judge you will be the twenty four year old girl with a target on your back. 63.

80) 13) dialog: I googled you.
80) 18) dialog: It's what us modern girls do when we have a crush.
80) 22) dialog: Well, that depends. Is the bag empty because you hate people or just the baggage they bring along?
80) 26) dialog: You just don't want to be tied down? The whole responsibility thing.
80) 30) dialog: You're not going to answer? You're just going to tell me a story?

101) 67) dialog: Yeah, I can't believe I... Yeah, I'm in. When is it?
101) 71) dialog: Then kiss me.
105) 13) dialog: Hi.
105) 33) dialog: It's not exactly...

134) 23) dialog: ... just some guy who was lost.
138) 3) dialog: What were you thinking - Just showing up at my door like that?
138) 7) dialog: Come on, I thought we signed up for the same thing.
138) 11) dialog: I thought our relationship was perfectly clear. You're...
