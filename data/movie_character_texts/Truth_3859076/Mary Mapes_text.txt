81) 0) text: Dan at his desk, Mary on his couch. Each with a phone to their ear. A beat. Mary punches through the call.
81) 1) dialog: General Hodges, it's Mary Mapes. I have Dan Rather on the line with me-
81) 5) dialog: General, that was not me and it was not Dan-
81) 7) dialog: You- Excuse me? Dan looks over at Mary - what the hell?
81) 9) dialog: Sir, when we spoke on September 6th- I'm sorry, I'm just going through my notes- when we spoke, you said the content of the memos was familiar to you, is that correct? 76.
81) 11) dialog: And that they "reflected Colonel Killian's mindset at the time".
81) 13) dialog: What physically about the memos makes you now doubt their authenticity?

82) 4) dialog: Of course they didn't. They couldn't.
82) 6) dialog: Because they're copies! (MORE )
82) 8) dialog: (off their looks) There's no original ink or paper to test, so one can say with a hundred percent certainty they're real or forgeries. That's why they can attack us. Heyward and Schwartz stare at her.
82) 11) dialog: Those are lousy wannabe analysts-
82) 13) dialog: Our story was about whether Bush's connections got him into the Guard and covered for him when he missed commitments and every bit of research we found backs that up! The documents were just a small part of that, but they weren't the point of the story-
82) 15) dialog: They do not get to do this!
82) 17) dialog: They do not get to smack us just for asking the question! Silence. Josh looks away. Mary doesn't seem to realize what she's said. Heyward turns away from her. 79.

Mary smiles. Then has an idea. Types in a web address. Right-wing message board. Knows she shouldn't, but doing it anyway. Scrolling throu comments. Most of them focusing on CBS. Keeps scrolling. And then she stops. Pasted into the comments is a PHOTO OF HERSELF. Next to i Here's the bitch. Mary stares at it. A beat. Scrolls down. God, does she look like an evil lefty sneak. Somebody wore out the whole bag of ugly sticks on her. Ugly stick? She fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Scrolls farther. YUP. She sure looks like a socialist to me. Mapes: feminazi propagandist. 80. Methinks she is also of the "diesel" persuasion. A good many of them are forced to join those ranks because men a them like the plague. I'm picturing Sean Hannity right now sharpening his knife gut this witch. Eyes focused on the last three words floating on the scre Gut this witch

85) 2) dialog: I was worried there'd be cameras at the airport. Didn't want Robert to see that. Wrolstad nods, pretending he's okay with that.
85) 4) dialog: (not looking up) Working. Wrolstad looks at her.
85) 6) dialog: No, I don't want to take a fucking walk, Mark, I want to sit here and do this, okay?
86) 0) text: Wrolstad blinks awake again. Mary's standing over him.
86) 1) dialog: Sorry.
86) 3) dialog: No, it's not. It's like no matter what I say or do, I'm gonna get hit.
86) 5) dialog: When my Dad used to start in on me, I'd think, "I'm not gonna cry, I'm not gonna ask him to stop." I'm not going to give him the satisfaction of seeing how much it hurts. So he'd just go harder. And I'd think, Someday, I am going to fight you. (shakes her head) But I never did. Wrolstad stares at her.
86) 12) dialog: What if my source doesn't want to talk to them?
86) 14) dialog: I just want you to know how important your support has been through this entire process.

87) 5) dialog: I'm sorry, Nicki, I'm tired.
87) 7) dialog: No one's saying he did. I just need him to get on the phone with my boss and tell him what he told me. Nicki doesn't respond. Mary plays her last card.
87) 8) dialog: It would mean a lot to Dan. Please? Another beat and then...
88) 0) text: Mary, Dan, and Betsy on couches. Josh and Mary Murphy sit in chairs. Heyward sits at his desk, leaning on a speaker phone. 84.

94) 0) text: After. Mary, Betsy, Smith and Roger sitting silence. Pass a package of potato chips back and forth. Smith exhales.

98) 4) dialog: Andrew asked you to apologize? Dan looks up at her.
98) 6) dialog: It's surrender.
98) 8) dialog: He knew. Even before we went down there. He just wanted Burkett on tape...

99) 5) dialog: I know what this is about. Josh, remember when I told you Burkett wanted to give the Kerry campaign advice on the swift boat stuff? Josh just stares at her.
99) 6) dialog: I wanted to do a bullshit check on Burkett after he said he'd talked to (MORE )
99) 8) dialog: Howard Dean? You said I could contact the Kerry people to check and then Burkett wanted me to give them his phone number and you said I could, so I did. (pause) Do you remember any of this?

After extensive additional interviews, I no longer have the confidence in these documents that would allow us to continue vouching for them journalistically. I find we have been misled on the key question of how our source for the documents came into possession of these papers. That, combined with some of the questions that have been raised in public and in the press, leads me to (MORE )
101) 3) dialog: You paper trailed them.
101) 7) dialog: And we're as bad as them? 99.

105) 10) dialog: What about my father? Smith blinks. Said something he shouldn't have.

108) 8) dialog: Let me talk to him. She extends her hand for the phone. Wrolstad gives it to her. We think she's going to lay into him, but instead:
108) 9) dialog: (softly) Daddy, please, stop. A beat. An exhale of breath from the other end.
109) 0) text: Mary lies in what almost looks like a catatonic state. No lights on, just the fading sun coming through the slats i the shutters. Wrolstad steps quietly into the room.
109) 1) dialog: I can't anymore.
109) 3) dialog: I don't want to. They can have my career. I don't care. (deep breath) I never should have asked the question... Wrolstad looks at her. He knows that's not true.
109) 5) dialog: Guess so. 108.
109) 7) dialog: That's not fair.
109) 9) dialog: (softly) Don't...
109) 11) dialog: Fuck you... He puts his hand on her brow.
109) 13) dialog: Even if the system is rigged?
109) 15) dialog: Why? Wrolstad smiles at his wife - isn't it obvious?

111) 1) dialog: Do you believe I did my job?
111) 3) dialog: It does to me.

111) 7) dialog: Excuse me?

116) 2) dialog: Don't I look calm? 113.
116) 4) dialog: But-
117) 2) dialog: Absolutely.
117) 5) dialog: That referred to a piece of information Mike uncovered working on a documentary for the Germans.
117) 7) dialog: I think specifically it referred to Bush losing his nerve while flying. 114.
117) 9) dialog: I didn't think we had it nailed down.
117) 11) dialog: I would say it's accurate that we were looking for any information about his time in the Air National Guard that had not yet come to light.
117) 13) dialog: It was tasty because it had the potential to be newsworthy. Mike and I are friends, we use a shorthand. Sarcasm, jokes.
117) 15) dialog: I suppose.
117) 17) dialog: I can assure you, we take our work very seriously.
117) 21) dialog: I don't believe so.
117) 23) dialog: Because it seemed that what our source was telling us was true.
117) 25) dialog: You would have to ask Colonel Charles. Hibey nods. Good answer. But Mary continues:
117) 26) dialog: But also, I'd say he was coming from a place of not being sure whether the memos were real or not and then becoming confident that they were.
117) 30) dialog: I wouldn't say that.
117) 33) dialog: We took several steps to vet these memos .
117) 35) dialog: Much of the formatting and terminology used is consistent with the period-
117) 37) dialog: (insisting) Is consistent with the period, as is the content of the memos, which was verified by several different sources who knew Colonel Killian-
117) 39) dialog: I believe so.
117) 41) dialog: "Officer Effectiveness Training Report."
117) 43) dialog: That's not true.
117) 45) dialog: I wouldn't do something like that.
117) 47) dialog: Official document. Top of the page. Lanpher looks. The others around him do too. The top of the page reads - Officer Effectiveness Training Report. A beat. Mary looks at Lanpher, pleasantly. Waiting.

123) 10) dialog: When?
123) 12) dialog: Oh, Dan...
123) 14) dialog: You're a shitty liar, you know that? (MORE )
123) 16) dialog: (tears in her eyes) Why didn't you ask me? Everyone else asked after the shit hit the fan, why didn't you?
123) 18) dialog: Why didn't you ask me if the documents were real?
123) 21) dialog: Yes, Dad. A beat. Dan puts down his glass. Smiles.

125) 0) text: Mary and Hibey sit across from the panel. One more time. Rain streaks the windows. Things are wrapping up.
125) 3) dialog: Aren't you going to ask about my politics? Missal blinks. Hibey shoots her a warning look.
125) 5) dialog: You've asked other people what I believe. Aren't you going to ask me?
125) 8) dialog: Do you mean, "Am I now, or have I ever been a liberal"? A number of the panel shifts in their seats uncomfortably
125) 10) dialog: Is it?
125) 12) dialog: No, you did when you asked all my co- workers. So I'll tell you. I don't believe in labels. I think most people have a mixture of views-
125) 14) dialog: Then what are you talking about, Larry?
125) 16) dialog: I did nothing of the kind.
125) 18) dialog: Do you know what it would take to fake these memos?
125) 20) dialog: No, this is important. It would require the forger to have an in depth knowledge of the 1971 Air Force manual, including rules, regulations, and abbreviations. He would have to know Bush's official record backwards and forwards to make sure that none of these memos conflicted with it. He would have to know all the players in the Texas Air National Guard at the time - not just their names but their attitudes and opinions including how they related to one another. He would have to know that Colonel Killian kept personal memos for himself like this in the first place. He would have to know how Killian felt at the time, particularly about his superiors and then first Lieutenant Bush. He would have to know or learn all of this in order to fool us as you assume he did. (leaning forward) Now. Do you really think a man who takes that kind of time and precision then goes and types these up on Microsoft Word? The men stare at her. Nobody has a response to that. Thunder in the distance.
125) 21) dialog: Our story was about whether Bush fulfilled his service. But nobody wants to talk about that. They want to talk about fonts and forgery and conspiracy theories. Because that's what people do if they don't like a story these days. They point and scream. (MORE )
125) 23) dialog: They question your politics, your objectivity - hell, your basic humanity - and then they hope to God the truth gets lost in the scrum. (shaking her head) And when it's finally over, they've kicked and shouted so loud we don't even remember what the point was. Rain continues to fall. And then from the back of the roo
125) 26) dialog: By that standard the Times would never have run the Pentagon Papers, the Post would never have listened to Deep Throat-
125) 28) dialog: Ben Barnes has confessed to abusing his power to keep some of the richest and most privileged sons of Texas from getting their asses blown up in Vietnam!
125) 30) dialog: No, sir. No, I do not. 127. Thornburgh nods. A beat. He's heard what he came to hear.

136) 1) dialog: You want to take a walk? Wrolstad grins and bounds to his feet. He takes her hand and leads her out the door. And we get the feeling that maybe, just maybe, they'll be okay. We hold on the door and slowly pan back to the television Sitting there, mercifully silent. As we PUSH IN, these words appear on screen... Following Mary Mapes' firing, CBS News won a Peabody Awar for her story on Abu Ghraib. It is considered one of the most important pieces of journalism of the decade. Mary Mapes has not worked in television news since 2004.
