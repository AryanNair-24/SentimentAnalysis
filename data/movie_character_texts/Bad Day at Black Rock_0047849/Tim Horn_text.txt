25) 15) dialog: Me, I didn't even try to find out. (a beat) Don't you understand? (he taps the badge on  his chest) When you wear that badge, you're the  Law.

H floorboards the Packard. Like some monstrous battering ra the heavy car smashes into the jeep's rear bumper, kickin the smaller vehicle jerkily ahead. Coley floorboards the pedal, again. Each time he slams into the jeep with sicke force, with the brutal abrasion of metal pounding metal.
45) 0) text: Doc sits deep in the battered upholstery of one of the ch He stares fiercely across the room at Smith who is on the couch, reading a neatly folded newspaper. Behind him at t clerk's desk, Pete is fitfully involved in a game of  solitaire. At the foot of the stairs Hector is pouring ch into a slot machine. It whines, grinds, and clicks with  rhythmic monotony, but it never seems to pay off. In the  chair nearest Doc is Tim, with one of his boots off. He w hard and with some concentration, removing the other. The he places them neatly at the foot of his chair. He wiggle his toes -- watching them with some interest. The wheeze and whir of the slot machine stops. The sudden silence turns the eyes of the men toward Hector and the o arm bandit. They follow his gaze up the steps.
45) 16) text: Doc follows his gaze as Hastings enters the lobby and loo around. He sees Macreedy coming toward him. He walks rigi in an arc past Macreedy to Smith.

45) 45) text: He walks out, the new Sheriff strutting beside him, with  Hastings in their wake. For a moment Macreedy, Doc and Ti stand in the center of the lobby. Pete eyes them non- committally and goes back to his solitaire. He glances up now and then, moving the cards with a purposeful sort of  slowness, as of a more natural swiftness restrained by hi preoccupation with the three men in the lobby. Macreedy is deep in thought. Abstractedly he tugs at his  collar and then repeats the ritual of lighting a cigarett Tim's shoulders are slumped. Humiliation has corroded him flesh and soul. Even Doc is momentarily subdued; he too,  feels degraded, unclean. Macreedy looks from one to the o of the good, ineffectual companions that circumstance has haphazardly tossed his way. He takes a few steps to his  suitcase, Doc and Tim trailing him; Doc, for want of some better to do; Tim, out of his deep, inexpressible need fo support. Macreedy takes an untapped bottle of whiskey fro his bag. He thumbs the cork loose and holds the bottle ou to Tim. Tim takes a drink. The light on the clerk's desk goes on, and we are aware t day has gone and that night is falling. The pressing, fie light has drained from the lobby, leaving a shadowy, silv dreariness. The shadows have lengthened and the silver ha tarnished with the darkness.
