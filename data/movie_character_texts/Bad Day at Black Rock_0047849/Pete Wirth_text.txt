45) 0) text: Doc sits deep in the battered upholstery of one of the ch He stares fiercely across the room at Smith who is on the couch, reading a neatly folded newspaper. Behind him at t clerk's desk, Pete is fitfully involved in a game of  solitaire. At the foot of the stairs Hector is pouring ch into a slot machine. It whines, grinds, and clicks with  rhythmic monotony, but it never seems to pay off. In the  chair nearest Doc is Tim, with one of his boots off. He w hard and with some concentration, removing the other. The he places them neatly at the foot of his chair. He wiggle his toes -- watching them with some interest. The wheeze and whir of the slot machine stops. The sudden silence turns the eyes of the men toward Hector and the o arm bandit. They follow his gaze up the steps.
45) 3) dialog: Nothing.
45) 5) dialog: (returning to his  cards) Nothing.
45) 45) text: He walks out, the new Sheriff strutting beside him, with  Hastings in their wake. For a moment Macreedy, Doc and Ti stand in the center of the lobby. Pete eyes them non- committally and goes back to his solitaire. He glances up now and then, moving the cards with a purposeful sort of  slowness, as of a more natural swiftness restrained by hi preoccupation with the three men in the lobby. Macreedy is deep in thought. Abstractedly he tugs at his  collar and then repeats the ritual of lighting a cigarett Tim's shoulders are slumped. Humiliation has corroded him flesh and soul. Even Doc is momentarily subdued; he too,  feels degraded, unclean. Macreedy looks from one to the o of the good, ineffectual companions that circumstance has haphazardly tossed his way. He takes a few steps to his  suitcase, Doc and Tim trailing him; Doc, for want of some better to do; Tim, out of his deep, inexpressible need fo support. Macreedy takes an untapped bottle of whiskey fro his bag. He thumbs the cork loose and holds the bottle ou to Tim. Tim takes a drink. The light on the clerk's desk goes on, and we are aware t day has gone and that night is falling. The pressing, fie light has drained from the lobby, leaving a shadowy, silv dreariness. The shadows have lengthened and the silver ha tarnished with the darkness.
45) 51) text: Pete comes out from behind the desk, walking from one lam in the lobby to another, turning them on.
45) 56) text: He downs a snort, then looks at Pete, who approaches them
45) 58) text: As Pete turns on the lamp behind Doc, he reacts ever so  slightly to Doc's words. His almost imperceptible grimace not lost on Macreedy. Macreedy watches the young man as h continues to light the lamps...
45) 62) text: Self-consciously Pete has backed off until now he leans  against the outside of the clerk's desk. But he still can shut his ears to what Doc is saying...
45) 72) dialog: (to Doc) You'd be smart to get out, too.
45) 74) dialog: You're a troublesome dummy. You're  liable to end up on your own slab...
45) 76) dialog: Go home, Doc. (he jerks his head  toward Macreedy, and  with mock bravado...) He's all washed up.
45) 78) text: His right hand closes over the neck of the whiskey bottle the end table. Abstractedly fingering it, he walks with t deliberate steps toward Pete at the desk.
45) 80) text: He continues to advance inexorably toward Pete.
45) 81) dialog: (flatly) You shouldn' of got off.
45) 89) text: He is now within a couple of yards of Pete.
45) 90) dialog: (drily) Sure. You're a man of action.
45) 92) text: For a moment Pete stares at Macreedy, terribly disturbed the incisiveness of Macreedy's analysis. Then...
45) 93) dialog: (bitterly) My memories are so pleasant as it  is...
45) 94) text: In sudden frustration, Pete grabs the deck of cards on th clerk's desk and slams them down hard. They scatter. He t stares blankly [...] between Doc and Macreedy.

45) 102) dialog: He was sore when he got back. About  ten o'clock he started drinking.
45) 104) dialog: Yeah. Hector joined him, and Coley.  Then Sam, and about nine p.m. -- me.  We were all drunk -- patriotic drunk.  We went out to Komako's for a little  fun, I guess -- scare him a little.
45) 106) dialog: We'd seen him around some, but none  of us knew him. When he heard us  coming, he locked the door. Smith  started a fire. The Jap came running  out. His clothes were burning. Smith  shot him. I didn't even know Smith  had a gun.
45) 108) text: Pete nods helplessly, bowing his head. Macreedy sighs, lo down at the bottle in his hand, slowly puts it on the tab
45) 114) text: Silence. Doc, realizing the enormity of Macreedy's admiss frowns, rubs a hand across his tired eyes. Pete looks at  Macreedy for a long, shocked moment. He shivers.
45) 115) dialog: (awfully) God forgive me...
45) 118) text: Pete is motionless, holding the glass inches from his lip hypnotized by Macreedy's voice, as hard and as cold as hi eyes...
45) 120) text: Macreedy's hand shoots out, in a short, inexorable arc,  smashing his palm across the shot glass. The whiskey burs in a spray, the glass flies halfway across the room,  shattering as it lands against something solid. Pete is  stunned, Doc perplexed, at Macreedy's violence. They star at him... Macreedy's eyes are murky. The creases between the brows  over his nose are deep. His nostrils move in and out with his breathing. Pete and Doc regard him with growing  uneasiness. Rage comes into Macreedy's face, turning it a painful red.
45) 124) text: Pete squirms under Macreedy's relentless attack.
45) 125) dialog: (shaking his head) You don't have to remind me. I've  never forgotten...
45) 127) text: Macreedy grabs the bottle, shoving it across the table to Pete.
45) 129) text: Pete pushes the bottle aside, too ravaged by Macreedy's w and his own thoughts to drink. He shakes his head grimly then, with sudden decision, goes to the switchboard and p in a line.
45) 131) dialog: (into phone, ignoring  Doc) Hello, Liz. Now listen... I... 'm  getting Macreedy out of town...
45) 134) dialog: (into phone) I don't care about Smith! Let him  try to kill me -- I might as well be  dead as...
45) 136) dialog: (into phone,  interrupting) Liz, Liz... There's not much of me  left any more, but however little it  is I won't waste it! (again Liz's voice  briefly; then...) I'm telling you because we need your  help. (again Liz's voice) ...No matter about the past -- you've  got to do this! You'd be saving two  lives, Liz. Macreedy's, and mine. (again Liz answers  and...) All right. Yeah... I've told him  everything.
45) 138) dialog: (flatly) She'll be here in five minutes.
46) 0) text: Pete and Doc are nervously alert, drained of energy, wait Hector is downright bored. He toys with his pistol, squin at it, twirling the barrel. Finding neither interest nor  pleasure in the piece, he jams it back in his holster and strolls with exaggerated surety out on the porch.
50) 0) text: At the far end b.g., toward the lobby, a single unshaded  light bulb burns dully. A slight figure stands in f.g. To one side is a narrow U-shaped alcove blanketed in heavy  shadows. The features of the man in the hall and the slim lines of his body blend vaguely in the darkness. With eno care, he turns a knob and opens the door leading to the a behind the hotel. Light thrown by the back windows reveal that the figure is Pete. The same pallid light from the a glancing across the alcove, momentarily illuminates it. G as close to the recessed wall as is humanly possible is D He is partially shielded by one of those hotel hose wheel around which an old fire hose is wound. The heavy brass n of the hose hangs from the end. Doc grips a twelve-inch length of lead pipe. Pete swallow nervously and peers outside, first to the right, then to left. His eyes glaze with fear, and his jaw tightens with tension.

52) 11) text: Pete is unable to answer. He is scared to death.
54) 0) text: Now Hector is alert. He studies Pete's twitching face.  Elaborately he tears a match from the pack and scratches It takes fire, cupped in the rampart of his big hands. It lights up the hall, and as Hector looks around he sees  something through a mirror -- over his shoulder and six f away Doc materializes out of the shadows of the alcove. A Hector whirls, going for his gun, Doc swings the hose wit sudden deadly aim. It uncoils like a snake, and the brass nozzle crashes with a mighty thud across Hector's skull.  Hector groans.
