This is Teresa Delgado, a wisp of a young girl, whose childish, smooth f might go unnoticed if it were not for her enormous and wistful dark eyes. She has on a skimpy cotton dress drawn at the waist with a five-and-ten cent store belt. Having looked again up and down the street she pulls down the sa and turns back into the room.

An Indian blanket covers the doorway into the only other room. The adobe walls are plastered with pictures of religious subjects. The wooden floor is bare. There is a charcoal-burning bra in one corner. Pots and pans on the hearth of the firepla show that it is a supplementary stove, The rest of the furniture consists of an iron bedstead, a large and hideo oak table and an open-faced china cabinet which contains Delgado treasures. Pedro, Teresa's nine-year-old brother is seated at the oa table, eating from a bowl of frijoles. He is, and looks l an imp. Teresa is backing away from her mother, who turns away from the window to face her angrily.

6) 19) text: Sra. Delgado gives the broom such a backward swing of fin purpose that Teresa hurriedly opens the door behind her a slinks out backwards -- her big liquid dark eyes, still futilely pleading, the last to disappear. Sra. Delgado mo after her, pushing the door closed. She puts the broom in the corner and goes to where Pedro seated. Here she stands a moment, fondly watching him as masticates his beans. Behind her the door stealthily open Teresa tries to sneak back into the room. Mamacita sees t movement and makes a tempestuous rush toward her, but Ter sidles out of the door before she can be caught.

9) 2) text: Over Teresa's shoulder, we see the interior of the little store light up dimly as a curtain is pulled at the back o the room. Beyond the curtain is revealed another room, brightly lit by a bare electric globe hanging from the ceiling on a cord. Under the light, a man sits at a table heartily eating from a plate heaped with food. The curtai has been pulled back by Senora Calderon. We see her only silhouette and the details of her face and figure are indistinguishable. We do see, however, that her long blac hair is down her back and she is braiding it. She walks a little ways into the darkened store.
9) 4) dialog: I just want a sack of corn meal for my father's supper!

10) 0) text: The Arroyo is a deep narrow cut in the mesa, boneВ—dry in season. Its floor of bleached sand and weeds stretches desolately wider a vast moonlit sky. Here and there, children's feet have scuffed steep little trails down the banks. Teresa appears at the top of one of these trails. She loo down into the Arroyo -- and then off to the right. A distance down the Arroyo is a bridge which carries a tr track across the dry river bed. To divert the rush of rai water in winter and spring, the bridge is underpropped by slanting stone piers. They stand out like ribs against th blackness of the underpass, which they divide into three tunnels. Teresa's face shows her dread of the Arroyo. She turns ba the way she came, takes a step away, hesitates and then returns to the edge of the bank. She starts down the little trail, her feet sliding in the loose sand and a shower of pebbles bouncing down ahead of her.

The light rapidly, so that after Teresa has taken a half dozen step she is swallowed up in complete blackness. The CAMERA HOLDS for a moment on the dark underpass befor Teresa emerges from the blackness on the West side. A lig scratching sound is heard. Teresa's eyes widen in panic a she hears it and she hurries out of the tunnel, watching fearfully ever her left shoulder. She must cut across in front of this other tunnel in order to get to the south b She starts across, never taking her eyes off the black tu mouth. Suddenly she gives a convulsive start and a little escapes before she can control it. A shadowy shape, low t the ground, detaches itself from the dimness of the tunne opening and moves toward her.

It is ver dim, but the luminosity of the damp wall casts a faint li on Teresa, reflecting in her wide, frightened eyes.

Second after second, flashes of light as brilliant as lightning illuminate the interior of the tunnel В— the reflections thrown into the Arroyo by the train windows. then, as abruptly as it began, the noise ceases.

Her eyes are wide and frightened From the other side of the wall comes a sound В— a light, scratching sound, exactly the same sound as that heard by Teresa Delgado in her first trip through the underpass tunnel. Listening intensely, Consuelo turns her head unti her ear is pressed against the wall. Now, we hear the sou more distinctly В— as she is hearing it В— but it is stil light, feathery sound. Then, suddenly, it ceases. And as Consuelo strains to hear it again, there is the sharp, ho clap of a car door carelessly flung shut just outside the wall. It is followed by the grind of a car starter. Consu jumps up.
