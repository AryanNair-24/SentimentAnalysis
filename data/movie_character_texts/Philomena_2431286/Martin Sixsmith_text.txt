12) 13) dialog: I’m thinking of writing a book. On Russian history. .? They look at him and no-one responds. Horrible eggy momen MARTIN (cont'd) Or something else. Might try going back to journalism-
12) 15) dialog: No I didn’t. Common mistake.
12) 17) dialog: No, that was someone else. What I actually did was, one year later, on the day of Princess Margaret's funeral, send an e-mail saying let’s make sure the only thing we ‘bury’ today - inverted commas - is Princess Margaret.
12) 19) dialog: It’s totally different. But the papers said it was another e-mail about burying bad news, nobody from the government defended me and... I got royally fucked up the arse by a bunch of self interested spineless shits.

PHILOMENA, walking across car park towards him, JANE by her side. His ghostly reflection in the glass is super-imposed over her for a moment... Curiosity aroused, he strains to get a good look - but ge only intermittent glimpses as a couple cars drive past on their way out of the car park.
