This is Sister ANUNCIATA, pale, red-haired, terrifie She looks at a pair of forceps in a metal bowl and knows should attempt to use them - but they seem monstrous, medieval.

Amongst other lunch time customers, al whom are very probably not interested in Russian history, FIND MARTIN standing waiting in the reception area, watch with faint disgust as the phone SALESMAN licks his finger MARTIN looks out of the entrance doors, his face reflecte the glass. He looks at his watch, ponders on why he’s her and not at all sure it’s a good idea. He glances out of t doors again... and he sees her. PHILOMENA, walking across car park towards him, JANE by her side. His ghostly reflection in the glass is super-imposed over her for a moment... Curiosity aroused, he strains to get a good look - but ge only intermittent glimpses as a couple cars drive past on their way out of the car park. He notes she’s dressed sma - presumably for his benefit - and looks nervous. As she finally enters the restaurant he smiles and steps forward greet her:
17) 2) dialog: Hello Martin. They shake hands; he notes the crucifix around her neck, in turn sneaks a look at him as he greets JANE.
17) 6) dialog: I’m all right. I had a new hip last year Martin, it’s much better than the bone one I had before and it’s made of ti-tanium which is metal - but it doesn’t rust.

18) 14) dialog: I disappeared from the world. My family didn’t visit me, and out of shame my father told everyone that I was dead. After you’d had your baby you had to stay in the Abbey for four years, totally cut off from the outside world. In order to repay the sisters for taking you in, you had to work. The sheer number of infants, their cots lined up with military precision, drives home the message about Roscrea that it is a place that deals in babies.
18) 16) dialog: The worst jobs were in the laundry, and that’s where they put me. I worked there seven days a week, the whole time I was there. They took in washing from miles around and charged for the service. We weren't paid a penny. I worked there with my best friend Kathleen. We find YOUNG PHILOMENA amongst them, dressed in a shapel pinafore, working over a boiling tub. Next to her is KATHLEEN, a pale faced young woman of roughly the same ag It's arduous, physically demanding work and YOUNG PHILOME and KATHLEEN, though worn out, try to keep each other’s spirits up with smiles of encouragement.

We pick out YOUNG PHILOMENA... her little boy ANTHO dark-haired, now three - the same age as the photo - runs into her arms. She hugs him tight, swinging him around, totally in love.
20) 2) dialog: Anthony was best friends with Kathleen’s daughter Mary - he’d even let her fly his little toy aeroplane. True love! The two of them were inseparable. The MOTHERS and CHILDREN are watched over by ANUNCIATA an another NUN, sitting together. YOUNG PHILOMENA and ANUNCI exchange a secret smile - but she can’t talk to her whils the other NUN is there, it’s not allowed.

22) 2) dialog: We all knew what it meant when a big car arrived. Kathleen was inconsolable. She knew this time they’d come for Mary. YOUNG PHILOMENA looks around and sees that, temporarily, YOUNG SISTER HILDEGARDE and one of the other nuns have disappeared - there is only one NUN left, who has her bac her. YOUNG PHILOMENA abandons her duties and crosses to a small basement window high up in the wall. Standing on tiptoes, she sees, beyond a hedge, a dreaded shiny black limousine drive past. KATHLEEN looks up at her piteously, pleadingly. YOUNG PHILOMENA catches the eye of another GI who shakes her head - ‘Don’t do it...’ - but ignores her checking that the NUN is still distracted, quickly darts through a back door.
23) 0) text: YOUNG PHILOMENA emerges alone into a small courtyard, cro to the far side and peers through some gates fencing her from the outside world. Foliage half obscures some well- heeled FIGURES getting out of the limousine - a thirty- something woman in a fur coat and a man in a Cashmere coa and Homburg hat.
23) 1) dialog: As soon as I saw their lovely clothes, and Mother Barbara so happy and smiling, I knew all hope was gone. She watches as they are greeted at the main entrance by a fawning and uncharacteristically gregarious Mother BARBAR Then, from behind:

The WOMAN crouches down to ANTHONY’S level and touches hi face tenderly. But, because she has her back to us, we st don’t see her face. We don’t need to, she simply represen money. A customer. The WOMAN takes the hands of both chil and leads them away. Over this we hear, incoming from the next scene, the CHOIR SINGING...
25) 0) text: YOUNG PHILOMENA sings in the chapel. She is with other MAGDALEN GIRLS on one row of pews; the NUNS, strictly segregated on another row, facing them.
25) 1) dialog: Normally, I loved to sing - it was one of the only things I enjoyed at that place. But all I could think about was poor Kathleen. We can see YOUNG PHILOMENA’S heart isn’t in it, her expression far off, her mind elsewhere. She sees ANUNCIAT enter the chapel and take her place with the NUNS. She catches her friend’s eye and manages to throw her a smile But ANUNCIATA, hollow-eyed, is unable to return it. YOUNG PHILOMENA sees tears in her friend’s eyes - she’s crying? Assuming she must also be upset about Kathleen, YOUNG PHILOMENA carries on as the hymn builds to a crescendo. But now a MAGDALEN GIRL enters the chapel and hurries to the others. She pushes through until she’s next to YOUNG PHILOMENA, then urgently whispers in her ear. The blood drains from YOUNG PHILOMENA’S face; panic-stricken she pu her way to the end of the pew. ANUNCIATA watches her go, agonized expression.

Some of the mothers and babies didn’t even survive the childbirth. 33. As we see this hit home with MARTIN, PHILOMENA presses th buzzer and, after a few moments, a YOUNG AFRICAN NUN - dressed much less formally than her 1950s counterparts in blue sweater and white blouse - opens the door.

Some Christian names are spelt with a ‘h’, some without; some surnames spelt ‘Leigh’ or ‘Lea’. Each file is different, have a military appearance, some civil, some even appear be criminal records. 68.

He is checking the photos attac to the records; one is a cutting showing a blonde busines shaking hands with somebody; another is a young black boy another is a man in a marines uniform. MARTIN dwells on s but quickly rejects others. He dials a number on his mobi waits impatiently for it to go through:
75) 3) dialog: Martin they’ve got pancakes over there, and waffles and omelettes - any filling - and cereals and bacon and sausage and-
75) 5) dialog: -anything you like. The breakfast is included isn’t it?

75) 22) dialog: What do you mean? 70.
75) 24) dialog: You should be nice to people on the way up because you might meet them again on the way down. I’d have thought you of all people would understand that. This stings, though maybe she didn’t mean it to. And then again, maybe she did? PHILOMENA (cont’d) I’d rather you were rude to me than the nice people who work here.
76) 0) text: MARTIN is studying his laptop. He sees a new e-mail in hi inbox from ‘Owsianoska, Caroline’, entitled ‘Anthony Lee’ opens it and clicks on a link. As he waits for it to down he sees PHILOMENA back at the omelette station, and catch snippet of her renewed conversation with the CHEF.
76) 1) dialog: -were you born in Mexico? Well you must like nachos? My grand daughter Natalie got me into them. I’ve never been to Mexico - I hear it’s lovely apart from the kidnappings- Shaking his head in exasperation, he turns back to the sc where an image downloads line by line from the top of the screen. We make out a blurry newspaper photo of a little and girl, holding hands with a smart, middle-aged couple posing at an airport arrivals lounge. MARTIN hears PHILOM share a laugh with the CHEF and is about to look over to when the image reveals the boy is holding a tin toy aerop in his hand. Stunned, he recognizes it instantly. He has found Anthony. The headline above the cutting reads: ‘New Life For Irish Orphans’. 71. Excited, he scans the article, picks up the surname Hess finds the boy’s Christian name: Michael. He puts ‘Michael Hess, D.O.B. 07.05.52’ into a search eng waits a few moments, then clicks on a site - the official site of the Republican Party. There is a picture of the a Michael, early 30s, smiling, in a formal head and shoulde pose. But it’s the passage at the top of the page which j him: Michael A. Hess: (b) 07.05.52 - (d) 08.15.95. He sta at the legend (d). Surely not..? Scarcely able to believe it, he scans the article below t picture, picks out some key sentences: ‘Michael was broug to the US from Ireland by his adoptive parents...’ and th at the end: ’... Michael died on August 15th, 1995.’ See MARTIN: Oh God, he’s dead... MARTIN looks up to see PHILOMENA making her way back to t table with her omelette and a bowl of raspberries. In a p he quickly shuts down the window showing the young Anthon clutching the aeroplane. PHILOMENA (cont’d) They’ve run out of blueberries so I got you raspberries instead. MARTIN just stares at her, frozen expression. She misinterprets this as an admonishment. PHILOMENA (cont’d) Oh, I’m sorry. Quiet time. As PHILOMENA puts down her tray she glances at the screen now just displaying the image of the adult Michael in the formal pose. She stares at it and, even though she can’t what Anthony would look like as a grown man, puts her han her chest. PHILOMENA (cont’d) That’s my Anthony. She looks at MARTIN, who doesn’t answer. But his eyes not only confirm this they tell her something else... she clutches her crucifix. PHILOMENA (cont'd) He’s dead... isn’t he.

She sees a YOUNG WOMAN picked up by her BOYFRIEND and swung r playfully as he gives her a kiss. He then pretends liftin her has hurt his back; she laughs. MARTIN looks across to PHILOMENA, not knowing what to say The lights change, the taxi pulls away.

83) 4) dialog: I don’t know.
83) 6) dialog: Oh... (She thinks about this) Yes please. He offers her his chair; she gets up and walks over, sitt down in front of his laptop.

83) 8) dialog: He looks very smart.

83) 13) dialog: Martin... This man looks just like you. He stops by the door. She points to a figure in the back of the photo. MARTIN walks back over to the desk and look more closely. Puzzled, he enlarges the picture slightly, looks intently at the figure.
83) 15) dialog: Where?
83) 17) dialog: Oh dear God...
83) 19) dialog: (Hungrily) What was he like? 79. Now we see the first chink in Martin’s armour of detachme he is personally involved.

83) 21) dialog: You must remember something.

She looks up, sees MARTIN’S and MARCIA’S blank faces. PHILOMENA (cont’d) They're a firm of solicitors in Castlebar. Did he ever mention Ireland to you Marcia?

MARCIA (cont'd) I would accompany him when he went to official functions because being gay was frowned upon in the Republican party. But he was very charming and very charismatic. PHILOMENA clasps her chest.
85) 11) dialog: I knew it Martin... I knew he'd be charismatic. (To MARCIA) Now did he father any children Marcia?
85) 13) dialog: Oh, I always knew that. I just thought he might have been bi- curious. (They look at her) A lot of the nurses I worked with were gay but one of them, called Brendan, told me he was bi-curious. I don’t think he could make up his mind Marcia.

88) 17) dialog: Hmm... PHILOMENA clutches at one last straw. PHILOMENA (cont'd) Mary, can I just ask, there’s one thing I’d like to know. Did Anthony ever mention Ireland, or where he'd come from?
88) 19) dialog: No. Why would you... She smiles weakly, but is crushed. We move slowly to a CL UP on PHILOMENA as the SCORE swells, MARTIN’S small talk like white noise in the background... 87.
88) 29) dialog: I was going to ask you Martin, if it would be possible to not use my real name when you write the story? He looks at her, doesn’t answer. PHILOMENA (cont’d) Perhaps you could call me Nancy? I’ve always loved that name. My niece is called Nancy... oh - people might think it’s her. (Thinks some more) What about Helen? Helen Keller? No, there’s someone already called that, isn’t there.
88) 31) dialog: I'd like to stop off and go to confession, if we could find a church on the way back.

She is a keeping a tight rein on her emotions.
90) 12) dialog: Well, you heard what Mary said - she said he never gave me a second thought. He wasn’t my Anthony - he was somebody else’s Michael. He probably hated the thought of me.
90) 14) dialog: I should never have let him out of my sight.
90) 18) dialog: People need to know about what happened to you. This is an injustice, it needs to be exposed. She looks into his eyes, senses that his priorities are n longer what she thought they were. Her voice lowers.

97) 12) dialog: No thank you. I just want to have... (Phrase pops into her head) -some quiet time.
98) 3) dialog: Martin, there’s something I have to say to you- He looks up, surprised to see her down in the bar. PHILOMENA (cont'd) I’ve made a decision and my mind’s made up and there’s nothing you can say that’s going to make me change it. (Beat) I appreciate everything you’ve done for me, and thank you for putting up with me, I’ve enjoyed the hotels and all the food and everything, but this hasn't really worked out the way that I wanted it to. So, tomorrow I think we should get on an aeroplane and go back to England. There it is, and that’s an end to it. (Beat) And don’t try to change my mind by saying all clever things and trying to confuse me because I didn’t go to Oxbridge like you- MARTIN’S mobile starts to ring, interrupting the argument checks the display: ‘Sally Mitchell’ and quickly kills th call without answering. He looks at her:

Of course she is saying this as much to herself as Martin Frustrated, he leans back in his chair in angry silence, up, paces about. He stops to look at a classic ‘Sacred He image of Jesus on the wall, one so familiar to Irish households: Christ, palms turned outwards, displays stigm wounds, and his heart is visible beneath his robes, glowi and enveloped in a crown of thorns. He turns to see PHILO sitting on the edge of her chair, bag on her lap, waiting obediently that he is irritated by her. He looks at his w - the delay in seeing them is outrageous.
