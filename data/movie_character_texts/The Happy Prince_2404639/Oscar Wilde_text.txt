Inside the cubicle a trembling OSCAR fills the whole spac ROBBIE is squashed against the toilet. Neither one can un their trousers. From a hole in the wooden partition a tongue waggles.

78) 75) dialog: Why did Constance die? Why have I become so mad? Reggie, my brain has crashed and shattered. Is this... OSCAR is trembling. REGGIE takes his hand.

As I passed by, I heard the man yelling out that question to his audience. It struck me as being rather dramatic. A wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a macintosh, a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, anda wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips. It was really very good in its way. The THREE MEN laugh. OSCAR is proud of his memory.
