Seve desks have been cleared and pushed together, and on top o this improvised stage four female employees and Mr. Dobis with his pants-legs rolled up, are doing a Rockette kick routine to the tune of JINGLE BELLS. Employees are ringed around the performers, some drinking out of paper cups, others singing and clapping in rhythm. One of the cubicles has been transformed into a bar, and is jammed with people. Mr. Kirkeby and Mr. Vanderhof are pouring -- each has a couple of bottles of liquor in his hands, and is emptying them into the open top of a water- cooler. But the stuff is flowing out as fast as it flows in -- everybody is in line with a paper cup waiting for a refil Bud comes shouldering his way out of the crowded cubicle, holding aloft two paper cups filled with booze. Since his promotion he has bought himself a new suit, dark flannel, and with it he wears a white shirt with a pinned round collar, and a foulard tie. He also has quite a glow on. Detouring past necking couples, he heads in the direction the elevators. The doors of Fran's elevator are just opening, and the switchboard operators, led by Sylvia, come streaming out.

47) 38) dialog: I don't know what you're talking about.
47) 40) dialog: (wanting to get away)

You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.

Underneath it says: SEASON'S GREETINGS from the SHELDRAKES
48) 21) dialog: (studying the card ruefully)
48) 24) dialog: I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.

There is something familiar about t cracked mirror of the compact -- and the fleur-de-lis pattern on the case confirms his suspicion. Fran notices peculiar expression on his face.
48) 32) dialog: What is it?
48) 35) dialog: I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel. The phone has started to ring. Bud doesn't hear it. He closes the compact, hands it to Fran.

On the coffee table are an unopened bottle of Scotch, a couple of untouched glasses, and a bo of melting ice.
51) 2) text: Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling? (no answer)
51) 4) text: Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy. (he resumes pacing; Fran continues crying)
51) 6) text: This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
51) 7) dialog: (through tears)
51) 10) dialog: Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.

51) 14) dialog: And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
51) 16) dialog: How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
51) 18) dialog: Merry Christmas. She hands him a flat, wrapped package.
51) 21) dialog: Yeah, we better.

51) 43) dialog: (turning her head)
51) 44) text: Careful -- lipstick. He kisses her on the cheek, hurries out of the apartment, closing the door. Fran stands there for a while, blinking back tears, then takes the long-playing record out of its envelope, crosses to the phonograph. She puts the record starts the machine -- the music is JEALOUS LOVER. As it plays, Fran wanders aimlessly around the darkened room, h body wracked by sobs.

In the bathroom, Fran switches on the light, puts her bag the sink, turns on the faucet. Scooping up some water, sh washes the smeared mascara away, then turns the faucet of picks up a towel As she is drying her face, she notices i the pull-away shaving mirror the magnified reflection of vial of pills on the medicine shelf. Fran reaches out for the vial, turns it slowly around in her hand. The label reads: SECONAL - ONE AT BEDTIME AS NEEDED FOR SLEEP. Fran studies the label for a second, then returns the via to the shelf. She opens her handbag, takes out a lipstick As she does so, she sees the hundred dollar bill Sheldrak left in the bag. Her eyes wander back to the vial on the medicine shelf. Then very deliberately she picks up Bud's mouthwash glass, removes the two toothbrushes from it, tu on the faucet, starts filling the glass with water.

62) 4) text: Well, it was just a suggestion -- no, you don't have to worry about that, Mr. Sheldrake -- I kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble, police-wise or newspaper- wise -- As Bud continues talking on the phone, Fran, in the bedro opens her eyes, looks around vaguely, trying to figure ou where she is. She sits up in bed, winces, holds her head her hands -- she has a fierce hangover.
62) 6) text: -- you see, the doctor, he's a friend of mine -- we were very lucky in that respect -- actually, he thinks she's my girl -- no, he just jumped to the conclusion -- around here, I'm known as quite a ladies' man -- In the bedroom Fran, becoming aware of Bud's voice, crawl out of bed and holding on to the furniture, moves unstead toward the living room door.
