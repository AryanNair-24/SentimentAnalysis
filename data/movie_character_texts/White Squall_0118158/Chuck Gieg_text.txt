3) 5) dialog: Though he had moved on with his life, now even for the years, to hear him eulogized by strangers, seemed strange.  He had been a hewner of stones, a pilot by the silent stars.  Like me, alone among many.  But most of all for us, the crew of the brigantine Albatross, he was always and would forever be... our Skipper. A SHIP'S BELL turns him around.  Ding ding.

15) 15) dialog: Jesus.
15) 23) dialog: He was everything I had expected, part Ahab part Queeg and even Bligh. He spoke in whispers and answered all queries with efficiency and directness.  He had gone to sea for the first time at fifteen, the same age as Bill Butler.  And as he looked upon us that first day it must have been as though he were staring into a mirror. Skipper manages a sobering look and climbs on top of the chart house.  He pats a small brass sign that is welded t the main mast and reads the inscription.

In each of us were feelings of anticipation and hesitation for the man at the wheel and of the unfamiliar world he was leading us into. She crashes through the surf -- driving, majestic music, building.
22) 11) dialog: It was my fault.  I slipped. Alice examines Chuck, making sure he's okay.  Skipper turns to Robin, who is shaken.  He never raises his voice

30) 6) text: Well, we're in it now. Chuck studies him, frightened, but reassured.
31) 13) dialog: The storm lasted sixteen hours and it set us all on equal footing.  It was the first time that we shared an episode on an even plane.  As we stood our watches we were equally out of control of our situation, regardless of our physical abilities or social backgrounds.  And though our real feelings lay hidden beneath bravado and defiance, we were no longer strangers.

37) 6) dialog: What do you mean?
37) 12) dialog: No way!
37) 16) dialog: I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
37) 18) dialog: So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop.  No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath.
37) 20) dialog: My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?" John and Robin crack up.
37) 22) dialog: I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.

41) 8) dialog: My dad.

51) 8) dialog: Takin' a piss? John turns away.
51) 11) dialog: Yes you do, stupid.  Because if you don't, I'm gonna go right up there and have a heart to heart with Skipper and you'll be on the first plane back to idiotville. John lunges at Chuck, sending them both sprawling.  Robin leaps on top of John.
51) 14) dialog: What? He lets go of Chuck and stands up trying to hide his emotions.
51) 16) dialog: You're not a moron.
51) 23) dialog: Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.

52) 1) dialog: What are they doing?
52) 18) dialog: Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
53) 2) dialog: Curacao seemed out of a dream, somehow make-believe.  But, as Ohio drew further and further away, it was home that began to seem unreal, drifting somewhere in the foggy reaches of our memories.  And I knew that each of us was falling in love. But not only with these wonderful women or the swaying palms and porcelain beaches... We were falling in love with the experience we were sharing, and with who we were becoming.
54) 1) dialog: Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
54) 3) dialog: Her name. (savoring the sound)
55) 0) text: Decorated with colored paper lanterns and streamers, a STEEL DRUM BAND softly plays in the b.g.  The crew slow- dance with their girls, dressed in cotton that seems to glow against their dark skin. Ms. Boyde is scrutinizing the body contact between Chuck and BREGITTA.  Their lips appear pasted together and she doesn't like it.  Lawford sees what is about to happen an hands his slimy cigar to George who reacts.
58) 0) text: Chuck and Bregitta, are at the end of the pier, a full moon hangs above the horizon.  Bregitta doesn't understan what Chuck is saying, but it's clear she's enjoying him.
58) 1) dialog: I can't remember feeling like this about myself, a place, someone like you.  We've come such a long way, seen so much.  But nothing like this. Bregitta smiles and takes Chuck's hand.  He's nervous.
58) 2) dialog: I'm not the best at expressing myself.  Maybe the only reason I can now is because I know you don't understand me. (beat)
58) 3) text: I like you so much.  Too much.  But how could I?  I mean, if we can't even communicate, how could I know you?  It's confusing.  We sail in an hour and I'll never see you again. Bregitta takes Chuck's face gently and kisses him tenderly.  Then, in perfect English...

67) 12) dialog: Of what?
67) 14) dialog: It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it... Suddenly it's as if Chuck is talking about his own life.
67) 15) dialog: I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
67) 17) dialog: They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same. Skipper sits up and studies Chuck for a moment.

75) 5) dialog: As Robin rang him out, we waved in silent protest against Skipper's decision.  And in the days that followed the low morale was matched only by a sense of arrogance that perhaps the master should step down and let his students take over.

77) 2) dialog: We all have problems.
81) 24) dialog: What'd he say? George smiles, impressed as well.
81) 27) dialog: With staff and string he showed us how to build a sextant.  As we rode the trades, he shared the ancient secrets of how to read the waves and follow stars.  And some mornings later, bathed in the orange glow of a sunrise, Panama rose from the sea like a phoenix.
83) 0) text: The sounds of slumber fill the cabin.  All seems well wit the world.  Suddenly, silhouettes in the darkness.  A hug bearded figure stands in the center of the cabin with a trident in his hand. Chuck wakes with a start.  He bolts upright to see the horrible figure of NEPTUNE himself (Lawford) towering before him.  He tries to scream, but hands cover his mouth.  He is dragged, struggling, up the companionway.
84) 0) text: The Albatross has been transformed into a ghost ship. Where the sails once were, only shredded fabric.  All of the crew have been brought on deck.  Powdered faces glow, surreal. John's head has been shaved into a mohawk.  Robin, Rick and Chris have been reduced to crew cuts.  The shears start over Chuck's head.  Neptune and his sidekick, DAVEY JONES (George) and two MERMAIDS (Bill and Alice) emerge with the rest of the crew.

Rick is in 'drag' as Neptune's girlfriend and must sing everything he says.  Charlie is dressed like a sloth and slithers along the deck. Frenetic chaos.
88) 1) dialog: We had journeyed over six thousand miles to the very edge of the earth. Like Darwin before us, we would witness the bliss of nature in the absence of man.  And it was as if the Albatross had forded time, leaving it behind.

102) 22) dialog: I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
102) 24) dialog: Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.

Suddenly, beneath him, a massive rumbling and explosion o foam.  Then, the tops of twin masts rise out of the water like shattered lances as the ship rights herself underwater.  She holds herself steady for a moment as if in a final attempt at resurrection, the Albatross begins to rise.  Faster and faster, until her entire length explodes out of the water in a mountain of foam and wave.
116) 3) dialog: 
117) 8) text: And Dick, please make a note of our final position. Lawford nods sullenly.  Chuck looks out at the floating wreckage around them, silent, lost. Suddenly, there is a 'thump' on the hull of the boat.  Th survivors share a confused look.  Then it comes again. Chuck looks out at the surface of the water.  It's suddenly alive... With sharks.
117) 10) dialog: 
117) 12) dialog: We slashed at the sharks as if striking out at the finger of God. And we all begged silently for the ability to understand what had happened.  But, if there was a God that day, his answer came only in the moaning wind and our questions were left to drift unanswered, in the titanic ocean of our deepest grief. Exhausted, Chuck stops slashing and stares out.  lost.

127) 2) text: Okay. Tears stream down his face.  He looks up and sees himself in the mirror.  The eyes that look back are eyes of the ages.  Involuntary sobs.  He begins to shake.  The tiny booth suddenly like a crypt.  Tight, with no air.  Chuck lets out a gasp.
127) 3) dialog: Oh God... Someone pulls open the curtain.  A MAN, from the next booth, fat and middle aged stands before Chuck in a pair of pants still sporting the price tags.  He looks down.
128) 0) text: Chuck explodes out of the dressing room.  Running, almost blind, he crashes into a rack of clothes.  Charles looks up as he scrambles to his feet and bolts for the doors.
129) 0) text: Charles bursts through the doors, looking up and down the street, but Chuck is... gone.
130) 0) text: The setting sun paints Chuck's face with golden light.  H stares out across the water.  Charles walks up behind him
130) 1) dialog: When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay. (beat)
132) 0) text: Standard fare.  Two beds and a T.V.  Chuck's lacing a new pair of sneakers.  Charles is in the shower.  There is a knock at the door.  Chuck cracks the door.  It's Charlie.
133) 3) dialog: They need it to be simple.  They need a reason.
133) 5) dialog: All of them.  Everybody waiting on that dock.
133) 27) dialog: This is crazy.  Nothing could have prevented what happened.
133) 33) text: I told you he was a turn coat the day we kicked him off the boat. Chuck frowns, troubled.
133) 34) dialog: No.  You're wrong.
134) 0) text: Chuck knocks quietly on the door.  Phil answers the door.
134) 1) dialog: Can we talk?
134) 6) dialog: Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
134) 8) dialog: Is it true Phil?
134) 10) dialog: You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
134) 12) text: I know enough. Chuck puts a hand out to stop him.
134) 13) dialog: Phil, please.  It won't change anything.  Tell him to call it off.
134) 16) dialog: Wait. Chuck hands him something.  Phil looks down, disbelieving It's the ship's bell.  Robin's bell.  Their symbol of unity, of putting loyalty above fear.
134) 17) dialog: We figured he'd have wanted you to have it. (beat)
135) 0) text: A small courtroom.  The room is filled with the crew members and their families, including the parents of the victims, as well as the media.  Phil sits with his father and dodges Chuck's eyes.  Coast Guard Officers Tyler, DOWNING and SANDERS head the proceedings.
137) 10) text: No.  I didn't. Again the crew members are struck.  Charlie turns to Chuck.
138) 0) text: The crew huddle in the parking lot.  Fractured, confused. Chuck, Tod, Charlie and Bill, stand off by themselves.
138) 4) dialog: You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
138) 7) dialog: But that's not the point...
138) 34) dialog: No!!!  Don't you walk away!  Not now.  Not after all of this!!!! Skipper keeps walking.  His head slumps.  Tyler pounds hi gavel.
138) 36) dialog: Tell me Skipper, was it all just a lie?  "Where we go one, we go all". We listened to you.  We believed it. And we're still here!! Skipper keeps moving.
138) 37) dialog: Shame on you then Skipper.  Shame on you. Skipper reaches for the door.  Suddenly a sound stops him cold in his tracks.  Phil slowly rises.  Tears streaming down his face.  Tightly in his hands he grips the ships bell.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  It is the ringing of the truth.  The tolling of their unity.
138) 39) dialog: Tell them the truth.  Make them understand. The room grows silent.
138) 41) text: You tell them Chuck. Chuck suddenly feels the eyes of the room.
138) 42) dialog: It's simple.  Bad things happen sometimes.  It wasn't Skipper or Tod.  It was all of us.  Everyone in this room.  Because we all knew the risks. (to parents)
138) 44) dialog: If you want to judge this man, judge him by his crew.  Judge him by Alice and George.  Chris and John and Robin.  In one way or another each one of them gave their lives saving one of us.  This may sound crazy but the Albatross wasn't just a ship, or even a school.  It was something that we made, that's inside us. That's who Skipper is.  That's what he taught us.  I guess what it really was about was... the privilege of sacrifice. Chuck turns to Skipper.
138) 45) dialog: Isn't that right? Skipper nods.
139) 0) text: Older Chuck has returned to the small building where the funeral services were held earlier.  The people have gone but the funeral urn remains.
140) 0) text: Chuck walks to the dock.  He has the funeral urn in his hands.  He steps aboard a small sailboat and begins untying her.  The HARBOR MASTER notices and steps out of his office.
140) 3) dialog: (softly)
140) 4) text: Stand away. He looks into Chuck's eyes and sees that he means business.  He backs off.  Chucks pushes away and raises the sail.  The harbor master watches, perplexed as the small boat moves off for open water.
141) 0) text: Bathed in the orange glow of the sun, Chuck stands naked against the ivory sail.
141) 1) dialog: They didn't take his ticket that day.  But why he never returned to the sea, I'd never know.  Perhaps he hadn't been able to free himself from the anchor of grief that had driven him to his knees aboard the Gran Rio, or that he no longer cared for the solitude and isolation of command without his Alice.  Or maybe it was just that the waves that had spoken to him for so long, had grown silent.  Whatever it was, that thing, it had always troubled me. Because, fate offers up no reasons. And maybe that's what I have traveled these thirty four years to say.  Maybe that is all I really know... And, that one man cared. Chuck turns to the sea and speaks.
141) 2) dialog: Rest easy old salt.  For together again, we'll sail. With a powerful heave, he hurls the Skipper's remains at the sinking sun and into the arms of Neptune.
142) 1) dialog: Some time later we learned that one of our long boats had been recovered.  Several young men found it washed up on a nameless beach somewhere on the island of Hispaniola.  No one seemed to know who they were or where they came from, but they seemed to know of the Albatross. (pause)
143) 0) text: Young again, their hair sun bleached and skins brown, Chuck, John, Robin, Rick, Chris and Tod, pound through th surf in a grinning footrace.  Brothers all.  Music builds
