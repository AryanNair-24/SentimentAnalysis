5) 20) dialog: as Dean finally gets under control. He looks around. The whole joint is staring at him. He picks up his cigarette butt and holds it as he addresses the other diners.
5) 21) dialog: Had a little cigarette mishap. It's under control. Show's over. Cool yourselves and resume breakfasting, people. (sitting, to Hogarth) What kind of pet, kid?
5) 24) dialog: Yes. No. Call me Dean. As Dean and Annie size each other up, the three Busybodie whisper cattily back and forth.

7) 9) dialog: (quietly, skin crawling) Okay... he's heading north. (finally) I'm sorry, kid... Dean stands spastically, again addresses the room. DEAN (CONT’D) I'd like to apologize to everyone in advance for this. He unzips his fly and out pops the squirrel.

52) 2) dialog: Don't worry, kid. It's not my style to report a guy to the authorities. He brings over two espresso cups and hands one to Hogarth DEAN (CONT’D) Espresso for me, Bosco for you. But I thought you'd dig the little cup. Hogarth looks pleased.
52) 4) dialog: My name's Dean. I'm a nobody. And you are...?
52) 6) dialog: So what brings you all the way up here, Hogarth? You riding some kind of crazy inspiration?
52) 8) dialog: Did you hear that??? He grabs a crowbar, runs to the door; Hogarth jumps up.
53) 0) text: The door flies open, Dean leaps out, YELLS:
53) 2) dialog: Who's out there?! He hears a metallic GASP. He looks up, up, up and sees th gargantuan Giant, tailpipes sticking out of his mouth, frozen, a guilty "caught!" look on its face. Dean YELPS..

59) 7) dialog: You can talk to him???
59) 9) dialog: I wonder if he had something to do with the meteorite that splashed down here the other day. Then again, maybe he was the meteorite...

59) 13) dialog: Or maybe we built him in one of ours. Our government has secrets, too you know.
59) 15) dialog: Maybe, kid. And then, again, maybe the monkeys evolved from us. Dean laughs and puts his hands behind his head, and strik a philosophical pose. 55.

66) 13) dialog: Why not?
66) 15) dialog: Okay, okay. I'm just saying, be careful. (pause) So... have we got a plan here? I mean, he can't stay here forever.
66) 17) dialog: The longer he stays, the better their chance of finding him. We've got to get him out of here, Hogarth.
66) 19) dialog: We could do it in pieces.
66) 21) dialog: You think he'd go for that? I've got a junk-truck -- I'm always hauling scrap. In half a dozen trips, we could get him to Canada. There are places in the Yukon, old mining sites, no one around, plenty of metal. He could roam the earth and live off the land... sounds pretty good, actually. Hogarth thinks about it.
