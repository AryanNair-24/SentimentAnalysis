70) 14) dialog: Hogarth. I would have thought a good American boy like yourself would have more respect for the work I do. The world has become a dangerous place, you know.

73) 7) dialog: But of course, sir. (loudly, for the busybodies) (MORE )
73) 9) dialog: When a five-star general needs my help, I'm only too eager to oblige. Annie comes by and refills their coffee.
