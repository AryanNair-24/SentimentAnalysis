21) 17) dialog: Metal! Delicious metal! Come and get it! ...and settles in behind a large log. He aims the camera, and waits. And waits. And waits. This is clearly not as exciting as Hogarth expected. He rubs his eyes, yawns, and lays his head on h arm. And the next thing he knows, he's waking up. The afternoo light has given way to the long shadows of early evening. Hogarth looks towards the clearing -- the piece of metal gone. He gasps. He reaches behind him for the camera, as he scans the forest, left and right. Suddenly he pauses. His hand is n finding the camera. He turns and looks for it. It's gone. Above him a flashbulb pops. A moment later, a roll of fil drops from the sky and lands at his feet. Hogarth picks u the film, and swallows hard. He looks up, a long way up, sees the Giant standing over him, its jaw moving, and a crunching sound coming from its mouth. HOGARTH (CONT’D) Aaaaagh! Hogarth runs as fast as his legs will carry him. He cover twenty feet or so, when -- BOOM! An enormous metal foot touches down in front of him. He runs faster, faster, but with a single step, the Giant covers all the distance between them. 23. Suddenly -- WHACK! Hogarth catches a tree limb across the chin, and is sent sprawling to the ground. The Giant loom over him. Hogarth sits up, his eyes wide with fear, and shouts at the fifty-foot metal monster. HOGARTH (CONT’D) What do you want from me?!! The Giant sits down with a thud. Then he reaches toward Hogarth with a closed fist, turns it palm-upward and open his fingers. There, in his hand, is the four-foot metal handle with "EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF" printed along its length HOGARTH (CONT’D) The shut-off switch... Hogarth looks from the handle to the Giant, in awe. HOGARTH (CONT’D) You saw me save you. As boy and Giant stare into each other's eyes, we cut to.

23) 2) dialog: "Talk." You know, words? "Blah- blah- blah," like that. Can you do that -- "Blah-blah-blah?" The Giant opens and closes his mouth in imitation of Hogarth. A series of deep metallic rumblings and clanging come out of his mouth. 25. HOGARTH (CONT’D) Well, you get the concept, anyway. But we need to work on your vocabulary. Let's see. Hogarth looks around, sees a rock, and picks it up. HOGARTH (CONT’D) See this? This is called a rock. "Rock." Try it. "Rooock."

23) 24) dialog: Look, we've pretty much covered everything in the forest. And if I don't get home soon, mom's gonna wonder where I am. (gets on his feet) You stay here, okay? I'll come back tomorrow. Hogarth waves to the Giant and EXITS. Now Hogarth hears a BOOM behind him. He turns to see the Giant following him. HOGARTH (CONT’D) And don't follow me, either. 27. The Giant continues following, happily.
23) 25) dialog: I said don't. Don't follow me. Stay. Go home. I mean it!

24) 7) dialog: Oh no... .(HE RUNS TO THE GIANT) Put them back RIGHT NOW!!! The Giant stares, puzzled. Hogarth GROANS, runs to a piec of track sticking up and pushes down on it with all his weight... it doesn't budge. 28.
24) 8) dialog: Like this. Help me! The Giant sees Hogarth struggling with the curled tracks, takes one index finger, and helpfully pushes on them: KA- BLAM! They're down.
24) 9) dialog: Good! That's it! The Giant grunts, pleased with himself... Hogarth HEARS t train, close now. And then he sees-- the pieces of track don't meet up.
24) 10) dialog: Put them together! Like this! Hogarth pantomimes. The Giant lines up one track-- HOGARTH (CONT’D) Now the other one... hurry! -- then tries to line up the other side, but it's tricky, the two chewed-on rails stubbornly resist lining up. Finally, the giant gets them close. HOGARTH (CONT’D) Good enough! Come on! Hogarth takes off, racing like the wind to get out of the He STOPS, looks back...
24) 12) dialog: No! Come on! The train's coming! The Giant is intent on his puzzle: CLICK. CLICK. Almost. Now we see the headlight of a big freight train coming ou of the fog.

An antenna rises out of the top of the Giant's head and begins to "signal". All the pieces SNAP to attention. They crawl toward the Giant, who gathers them in his arm and looks at Hogarth, confused. Just then we h voices coming from the fog.
25) 5) dialog: The train Conductor. Oh, we're in trouble now... 30. HOGARTH (CONT’D) (turns to Giant) Okay, look. I've changed my mind. You can follow me home. He hurries off down the hill, with the one-legged Giant hopping along behind him.

Suddenly the Giant is being hit from all sides (rifles, machine guns, bazookas): ARMOR (which we haven't seen before) slides out of his body and locks into a covering around him.
