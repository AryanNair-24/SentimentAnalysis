Forty feet tall, maybe fifty! Hogarth can't believe his eyes... The giant stares at the metal towers, makes a METALLIC GR that sounds... hungry. It reaches out and SNAPS off a thi piece of metal, pops it in his mouth, CHEWS NOISILY, and SWALLOWS. BURP. Mmmm good!

25) 3) text: And then, behind him, the Giant's head, still attached to its torso, sits up. Hogarth YELPS. The Giant's eyes spark, flash and click on. He looks around, dazed, at his scattered parts. HOGARTH (CONT’D) You're alive! The torso has one leg and most of one arm attached. The other pieces seem to come alive and scamper around as if confused. An antenna rises out of the top of the Giant's head and begins to "signal". All the pieces SNAP to attention. They crawl toward the Giant, who gathers them in his arm and looks at Hogarth, confused. Just then we h voices coming from the fog.

Hogarth looks up and sees an ARMY PLANE, flying towards him. The BEEPING gets louder. Hogarth realizes it's coming fro the Giant. Suddenly: WHIR, a panel on the giant's arm slides open. A strange device pops out and starts trackin the plane overhead. Hogarth panics: as the plane comes nearer the BEEPING becomes more insistent, the strange device tracks the pla it looks very retro-advanced and scary. The giant starts MOANING, thrashing in his sleep as if caught in a bad dream. Suddenly he wakes up and ka-CHUK!- the device withdraws. The plane disappears over the trees Hogarth looks at the giant, stunned. The giant, unaware, looks at Hogarth, puzzled. 52.

Then the Giant spies-- HOGARTH-- gagged and tied to the top of a radio tower on roof of the five story Cross building, the tallest in Rockwell. He squirms. The moment the Giant starts to move toward the building t Army (camouflaged) OPENS FIRE. 81. Suddenly the Giant is being hit from all sides (rifles, machine guns, bazookas): ARMOR (which we haven't seen before) slides out of his body and locks into a covering around him. A stray shot takes out of chunk of the base of the tower that Hogarth is tied to, and it starts to TOPPLE. The Giant SEES THIS and rushes directly into the line of fire to SHIELD Hogarth from being crushed by the tower. T Giant pulls the tower loose, sliding Hogarth into his met hand.

He doubles back in pursuit of the second missle. Sighting it, he FIRES --and MISSES repeatedly, losing valuable tim as he moves closer and closer to the missile. Finally he hits it.
