His face -- thin, dark, beautiful, could be Italian, Spanish, Black -- an indistinguishable mix, he is like the future and the past all rolled up in one. A small CROSS, old, silver, sits on a chain around his neck -- not as a fashion statement, or a fuck you, but a simple, personal, intimate expression of faith. A DOCTOR, a woman, all business, comes behind him.

9) 8) dialog: That's going to be you when you're old --
10) 1) dialog: He knows I'm carrying. David reaches behind his back and pulls out the ball. CURTIS starts BARKING and jumping around excitedly. Erica unfastens his leash. David gives the ball a toss. Curtis runs after it.
