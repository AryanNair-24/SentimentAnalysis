1) 1) dialog: I'm Erica Bain, and as you know, I walk the city. I bitch and moan about it. I walk and watch and listen. I witness all the beauty and ugliness that is disappearing from our beloved city. Last week took me to the grey depths of the East River where Dimitri Panchenko swims his laps like he has since the 1960s. And today I walked by the acres of scaffolding outside what used to be the Plaza Hotel and I thought about Eloise. Remember Kay Thompson's Eloise? Eloise who lived in the Plaza Hotel, with her dog Weenie and her parents who were always away and her English nanny who had 8 hairpins made out of bones -- As she talks, we see her -- thin, semi-transperant, ghostlike. Almost nothing but voice.
1) 2) dialog: That Eloise. The adored brat of my childhood. A little punk kid pirouetting round the grand ballroom, pouring pitchers of water down the mail chute, Upper East Side anarchist in pigtails, not unlike other brats and punks this city has brought to life. Sid Vicious spewing beer from his teeth in the Chelsea Hotel. Andy Warhol, his sunglasses reflecting Valerie Solana's gun. Edgar Allen Poe freeing live monkeys from the crates of a crumbling schooner on oily slips of South Street. Stories of a city that is disappearing before our eyes, its people swept over the Williamsburg, the Holland Tunnel, the Major Degan. (MORE) (CONTINUED)
1) 5) dialog: You can visit, but you can't live here anymore. So what will be left of those stories? Are we going to have to construct an imaginary city to house our memories? Because when you love something, every time a bit of it goes, you lose a piece of yourself. So where's Eloise going to sleep tonight? Can you hear her ghost wandering round the collapsing corridors of her beloved Plaza, trying to find her nanny's room, calling out to construction workers in a voice that nobody hears, has anyone seen my turtle Skiperdee?
2) 1) dialog: this is Erica Bain and you have been listening to 'Street Walk.' As the light turns RED --
2) 2) dialog: -- see you next week. -- perfect timing. As usual. CAROL OLSEN, 50s, very lefty liberal, very Ruth Hirshburg before she was Ruth Seymour, the director of the station, enters.

7) 0) text: A photography show. Kind of groovy, a tad trendy but cool. Erica, drink in hand, knows everyone, this is her crowd -- Erica drifts away, checks out the PHOTOGRAPHS -- a series of '60s storefronts, a GUN STORE, a LAUNDROMAT, a LIQUOR STORE. She SCANS them, taking in every detail, every color, every corner seeing to the very edges of the frame. Something JAMES, the GUY who shot them, appreciates.
7) 2) dialog: (off the storefronts) These are cool.
7) 4) dialog: They are really good. They're evocative, but quiet. They don't make a lot of noise. I like them.
7) 7) dialog: I wish. Erica, dragging a bit, sets her full drink down, heads for the door. Nicole stops her.
7) 9) dialog: No, not yet.

9) 9) dialog: I am old. But way meaner. (then) She gave me an apple. Erica takes a bite, as David puts his arm around her. Just before they leave, Erica wedges a folded newspaper in the door, props it open so they don't have to take their keys. EXT. CENTRAL PARK - STRANGERS GATE - NIGHT Al2 There's a magical glow in the sky, darkness has just begun to gather in the distance as Erica and David take a walk with Curtis.

10) 7) dialog: You have a family, David. I don't.
10) 9) dialog: Iam. Or kind of hope I hope I am. Your mother's a sweet woman. She wants the whole deal. Invites, a minister, the band playing. Maybe I want it too. It's not as if I'm going to do it twice. He looks at her. She really means it.

16) 0) text: Erica -- thin plastic tubes run from her broken, frail body, to big, square, pale-colored machines. It's ugly, survival. Uglier in a way, than even the attack. It is cold and without passion -- an odd way to hold on to a life.
20) 0) text: ON ERICA: Eyes open, staring straight up. She slowly moves her neck, taking in the machinery, the tubes, the room. She is awake and alone. And it freaks her out -- the dark, the quiet. Her fingers feel around the bed frame, find the remote. She presses it, the TV turns ON. 27 28 29 18.

30) 0) text: Erica, walking down the stairs towards the corridor that leads to the open door -- and the street outside. The corridor is long, dark, and eerie. The daylight gleams through the open door, but seems threatening, rather than comforting. She finally manages the journey down it, which seems to take an age. She makes it to the half-open door, and sees the silhouetted figures of construction workers on the scaffolding opposite her building. A LOUD CRASH -- which startles her. A plank has fallen to the ground below the scaffolding. A wind blows the dark netting, covering the scaffolding. Eerie, unsettling.
31) 3) dialog: Sorry -- She does a bad job of hiding her panic, her surprise. She heads back up the stoop.
32) 0) text: Erica, lying in bed, can't sleep. She takes another pill, chasing it with water. She gets up, walks around, hoping the pills will take effect but knowing they won't, just as the ones from the night before didn't. And the night before that. She goes into the --

36) 0) text: It's the same street she walked at the beginning, before the attack, a street she's walked a thousand times before. Hands in the pockets of her jacket, Erica heads down the familiar, quiet three-block stretch.
36) 1) text: She MOVES FORWARD DOWN the sun-lit street, familiar with its corners, its rhythms, its shadows -- But the sunlight only increases her unease. Every shadow holds a terror for her. A youth, sitting in the shadows on the stoop, talking into his cell phone. A car up ahead, a lone man sitting in it, again on the shadowed side. She speeds up to pass the car, but the CAMERA SLOWS ON his face, the windscreen cut in half by the shadow, his face against the shadowed seat. He seems to be glaring at her. Erica's eyes start scanning the street as she walks past the MAN in the car. The CAMERA SLOWS even more -- the few feet of shadowed pavement seem to take forever to cover. She makes it past, then the car door opens behind her. The loud sound of a DOOR SLAMMING. Then FOOTSTEPS, following. (CONTINUED)
37) 0) text: Erica enters through the main doors. Holds onto the door handle. She looks at the lobby area of the police station -- cops moving back and forwards with guns in holsters, people milling around, sunlight streaming through the huge windows. It seems all she can to enter this public space. But she does. Walks forward to the desk.
37) 2) dialog: Detective Pitney or O'Connor please.

37) 16) dialog: As she watches the COP SEARCH through computer files for her sleepless nights and battered body and dead dreams.
37) 21) text: Maybe it's the isolation in their faces, the unbearable knowledge that what happened to them will never matter to anyone as much as it does to them -- but all of a sudden Erica gets, as we do, what they have in common -- they're victims -- and she is one of them. After a beat, she gets up and leaves.
39) 0) text: Erica is standing in the kitchen, watching Nicole put the groceries away.

She picks up the GUN -- the weight of it, the steel, the finality -- does what the anti-depressants and sleeping pills and alcohol have failed to do, it calms her, soothes her -- She places it beneath her pillow and closes her eyes. And finally, sleeps.

52) 12) dialog: As she watches in utter horror. She breaks out in beads of sweat as she crouches lower to stay out of sight.
52) 16) dialog: She pulls the PHONE from her pocket and fumbles to turn it OFF. Too late. In the surveillance mirror she sees the GUNMAN heading her way. She's trapped -- terrified.
52) 18) dialog: as she FIRES TWICE more, blindly, BOTTLES SHATTERING. She listens to the silence then. Peers 'round the shelf that divided them. Sees a spray of blood, hitting a tomato can. Below it, the gunman dying, blood spouting from a single shot to his jugular vein. And then, in an act more significant than she knows, she pulls it together: She lowers the cocked hammer on her semi-automatic and puts it back in her pocket. She surveys the STORE -- sees the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA pointed down at her. She looks at the woman's dead body behind the counter and realizes she is beyond help. She reaches in, ejects the tape from the machine behind. She looks at the blood on the sleeve of her coat, wipes some from her cheek, hurries out of the store.
