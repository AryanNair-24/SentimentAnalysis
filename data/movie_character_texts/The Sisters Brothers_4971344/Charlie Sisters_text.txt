The brothers come out of hiding and move along, each to o side of the river. Warm and Morris fire. When the brother vanish into the forest, they stop shooting. Suddenly, the sounds of long 45 caliber flames pierce the day. We hear screams... then nothing. Eli reappears, dragging his feet, as if coming back from chore. Whena trapper arises from behind a thicket. Morris cocks revolver and shoots in a hurry. The trapper collapses revealing Charlie, his arm outstretched, his gun still smoking. The two men face each other. Frozen. And then slowly lowe their arms. A moment of unease. 86 EXT WARM’S ENCAMPMENT NIGHT: They sit around the fire in heavy silence. They pass arou jug of liquor.

A landscape like before th birth of the world. 89 EXT WARM’S ENCAMPMENT DAY : They cut the branches on a tree they just felled. A mule pulls a trunk into the middle of the river. Bare-chested, the men cut branches and carry rocks... The work up to their waists in water. The dam is starting to take shape. Warm crosses the damme river to gauge its depth. With a knife, he scrapes the boulders in certain spots. He examines the samples with a jeweler's magnifying glass. Very tight shot: striations in the rock, shimmers of quar golden reflections. 71.

0) 677) text: No, no, it’s just a long story. Charlie was always violent. When he got into a fight, it usually would end badly. And when you kill a man, you end up with his father, his brother or his friends on your tail, and you have to start all over again. One thing leads to another and I had to help him. He’s my brother. 75. They walk in silence. At one point, Eli makes a face. He his hand to his heart. He is dizzy.
