10) 54) text: The door opens and the Mayor enters.
10) 57) dialog: Don't pester me now, please. I got a  lot on my mind.
10) 62) dialog: (to McCue) Have you seen Sheriff Hartman?
10) 66) dialog: Not an iota. In what way can an  unavoidable misfortune of this sort  influence the duty of every citizen,  colored or otherwise?
10) 70) dialog: (to the Sheriff) Hartman, I've been looking for you!
10) 81) dialog: Pete, I want to talk to you!
10) 83) dialog: Did you actually give Williams that  gun?
10) 85) dialog: Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant  task to perf --
10) 86) text: The Sheriff suddenly nudges him for quiet, and the Mayor, turning, sees:
10) 89) dialog: What Red uprising?
10) 92) dialog: You can quote me as saying that  anything the Governor says is a tissue  of lies.
10) 99) dialog: We've got to go somewhere private,  Pete. I've got to talk to you straight  from the shoulder.
10) 104) dialog: Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt  this administration?
10) 106) dialog: Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic  uncles of yours? (gesturing) Out shooting everybody they see for  the fun of it?
10) 108) text: They come to the door of the Sheriff's office. Hartman op door and the Mayor enters, Hartman following.
10) 109) text: Hartman closes door and turns to Mayor, who faces him  portentously.
10) 110) dialog: Pete, you're through!
10) 112) dialog: I mean I'm scratching your name off  the ticket Tuesday and running  Czernecki in your place. It's nothing  personal. And, Pete -- it's the only  way out. It's a sacrifice we all  ought to be glad to make.
10) 114) dialog: Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my  Sentimental side.
10) 116) dialog: I wish you wouldn't talk like that,  Pete.
10) 118) dialog: (wavering and desperate) If there was any way out...
10) 123) dialog: (hotly) We're up against a lot more than  that with that nutty slogan you  invented: 'Reform the Reds With a  Rope'.
10) 125) dialog: Williams ain't a Red, and you know  it!
10) 127) dialog: I know it! But they've got nothing  to do with this case! Do you realize  there are two hundred thousand votes  at stake and unless we hang Earl  Williams we're going to lose 'em?
10) 130) dialog: What do you mean he can't get away?!  He got away, didn't he?
10) 132) dialog: Who's out there?
10) 139) dialog: (annoyed) What do you want?
10) 141) dialog: What's from the Governor?
10) 145) dialog: W-wait a minute.
10) 148) dialog: And you fell for it, Pete. It  frightens me what I'd like to do to  you. (to Pinkus) Who else knows about this?
10) 151) dialog: (to Sheriff) Get the Governor on the phone!
10) 153) dialog: Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you  like that. A guy does nothing more  strenuous for forty years than play  pinochle -- he gets elected Governor  and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
10) 156) dialog: (interrupting) Pure politics!
10) 159) dialog: (reading) Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
10) 161) dialog: Tell 'em the party is through in  this State on account of you.
10) 163) dialog: (apoplectic) And you can tell 'em as an  afterthought that I want your  resignation now!
10) 165) dialog: What is it?
10) 167) dialog: Tell 'em to hold the wire.
10) 169) dialog: Cover up that transmitter!
10) 170) text: Sheriff does so. Mayor faces Cooney.
10) 171) dialog: Now, listen! You never arrived here  with this -- reprieve. Get it?
10) 173) dialog: How much do you make a week?
10) 175) dialog: (impatiently) How much do you make a week? What's  your salary?
10) 178) dialog: How would you like to have a job for  three hundred and fifty dollars a  month. That's almost a hundred dollars  a week!
10) 180) dialog: (exasperated) Who do you think!
10) 181) text: Pinkus is a little startled; the Mayor hastens to adopt a milder manner.
10) 182) dialog: Now, listen. There's a fine opening  for a fellow like you in the City  Sealer's office.
10) 184) dialog: The City Sealer's office!
10) 186) dialog: (foaming) Yes, yes!
10) 189) dialog: Why not?
10) 191) dialog: (desperate) But you could bring 'em in here!  We'll pay all your expenses.
10) 193) dialog: For heaven's sake, why not?
10) 195) dialog: No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain  one! And I guarantee that they'll  graduate with highest honors!
10) 198) dialog: Now what do you say?
10) 200) dialog: No, it doesn't. (hands him the reprieve) Now, remember: you never delivered  this. (rushing him to the  door) You got caught in the traffic, or  something. (opening door) Now, get out of here and don't let  anybody see you.
10) 202) dialog: Come in and see me in my office  tomorrow. What's your name?
10) 204) dialog: (taking out his wallet) All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've  got to do is lay low and keep your  mouth shut. Here! (he hands him a card) Go to this address. It's a nice,  homey little place, and they'll take  care of you for the night. Just tell  'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty  dollars on account.
10) 209) dialog: (turning hastily toward  Pinkus) I'll explain it tomorrow!
10) 211) dialog: No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
10) 214) dialog: (pushing him out the  door) We'll fix that, too. (he closes the door  after him)
10) 216) text: He turns to the Mayor with a gesture of appeal. The Mayor closes the door and turns to Hartman.
10) 217) dialog: (huskily) All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
10) 219) dialog: Shoot to kill, I said.
10) 221) dialog: Nobody reprieved that policeman he  murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
10) 223) dialog: Now take that guilty look off your  face, Pete -- and stop trembling  like a horse.
30) 114) text: The Mayor comes into scene.
30) 115) dialog: Fine work, Pete! You certainly  delivered the goods. I'm proud of  you.
30) 117) dialog: (happily) A sight for sore eyes!
30) 119) dialog: Well! Looks like about ten years  apiece for you birds!
30) 121) dialog: Your luck's not with you now!
30) 128) dialog: All the lawyers in the world aren't  going to help you!
30) 130) dialog: (enjoying himself) The power of the press, huh!
30) 131) text: He laughs. Pinkus, the Governor's messenger, plentifully  stewed, reels in the door. He approaches the Mayor and Sh who have their backs to him.
30) 134) text: The Mayor and Sheriff spin around.
30) 135) dialog: (in a panic) Get out of here!
30) 142) dialog: Who is this man?
30) 147) dialog: You're insane!
30) 150) dialog: You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The  idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
30) 156) dialog: I never saw him before!
30) 162) dialog: That's absurd on the face of it, Mr.  Burns! He's talking like a child.
30) 164) dialog: He's insane or drunk or something.  Why, if this unfortunate man,  Williams, has really been reprieved,  I personally am tickled to death.  Aren't you, Pete?
30) 166) dialog: That's a horrible thing to say, Miss  Johnson, about anybody! (to Burns) Now, look here, Walter, you're an  intelligent man --
30) 170) dialog: (loudly) Take those handcuffs off our friends,  Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
30) 173) dialog: Walter, I can't tell you how badly I  feel about this. There was no excuse  for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
30) 177) dialog: (looking over the  reprieve) Sheriff, this document is authentic!  Earl Williams has been reprieved,  this Commonwealth has been spared  the painful necessity of shedding  blood.
30) 179) dialog: (to Pinkus) What did you say your name was --  Pinkus?
30) 181) text: He shows the Mayor a locket.
30) 183) dialog: A very fine-looking women.
30) 185) dialog: I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus,  and as long as I am Mayor --
30) 189) dialog: Don't make any hasty decisions, Mr.  Burns, you might run into a thumping  big libel suit.
30) 191) dialog: (trying to brush it  off) Now, my old friend the Governor and  I understand each other perfectly.
30) 193) dialog: (with superb contempt) So do you what, you hoodoo! (to Pinkus, suavely) And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come  with us, we'll take you over to the  Warden's office and deliver this  reprieve.
30) 194) text: The Sheriff, Pinkus and the Mayor go out of scene.
