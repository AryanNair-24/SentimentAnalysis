On the o side of tie room, Vivian and Beverly tell an animated two story to he teenage girl and the homey, finishing each others' se. .tences . NEIL (cont' d) Like any other part of our body, our brains have evolved a lot in a hundred thousand years. Our first thoughts were formless. Struggling consciousness. Sensation. An instinctive tie to our environment. But then our brains began to focus. We sacrificed the intuitions we first had so our thoughts could be directed, so we could master specific functions. That's where we are at the moment. We're brilliant with technique, but we've given up instinct. So the next evolutionary step, the step yet to come, or perhaps it's already in the making, is actually backward. To maintain our higher functions, but reawaken the part of our brain that was pure intuition. That was receptive to anything, because it didn't know enough not to believe. You're a freak of nature, pal, an evolutionary step. You're double- jointed. (taps his head) Up here.

Just enough to know it's there. (CONTINUED)

And people who demand proof -- well, this isn't something we can control, it comes when it comes, so if you can't make it happen, how can you prove it? It's like that singing frog in the cartoon, but when the guy puts it on stage it just croaks and he looks like a jerk. Herman laughs, horribly. He likes that cartoon. NEIL (cont' d) Some of us try anyway. I say who needs that kind of aggravation?
