Matt flies up behind him, and tries to help him, but Andr shoves him away. We're too far away to hear anything that said. Matt tries again, and Andrew yells something. Matt, clear upset, replies. Andrew, talking fast and jerky, gestures towards his burns. Matt tries to reply several times, but Andrew isn't hearing it. Matt smiles nervously at the destruction, and says something gently. Andrew replies, and whatever is said here, it causes a radical shift in Matt's demeanor. He's no longer concerne he seems repulsed. Andrew says more, clearly SCREAMING at Matt. Matt seems to beg Andrew for something and Andrew relents Matt continues, more forcefully, and then notices somethi to his right. A BUS SMASHES HIM OUT OF THE AIR, SWATTING LIKE A BUG INTO THE SIDE OF AN APARTMENT COMPLEX. Andrew suddenly turns, flailing an arm at us in the chopp a mailbox comes CRASHING UP INTO THE CAMERA. FROM MICHAEL ERNESTO'S CAMERA. MICHAEL ERNESTO is, along with several other people from building, out on his roof. He watches in horror as the helicopter Andrew hit goes out of control, falling out of frame. Moments later, we hear the explosion as it crashes.
76) 1) dialog: Oh, oh no, those people, man, those people, oh god-
76) 3) dialog: He's fucking dead man, you saw- oh shit oh shit- Andrew comes toppling down out of the sky like a wounded bird, crashing into the roof. He vomits again, mostly bil everyone around him is in shock, frozen, as he screams in pain and rolls over.
76) 6) dialog: Please man, please, I don't know you man-
76) 8) dialog: (breaking down) What? I don't know, I don't know you man, I didn't- please okay, please- Andrew starts to raise an arm, when he's suddenly NAILED MATT, blasting by at well over eighty miles an hour. FROM BANK SECURITY CAMERA. The inside of the bank is quiet and peaceful, when MATT A ANDREW COME CRASHING THROUGH THE ROOF. FROM POLICE CAR DASHBOARD CAM. The police car rockets up the street, but has to screech halt when MATT AND ANDREW COME EXPLODING OUT OF THE FRONT THE BANK. The two of them brawl in the street for a moment; it's no impressive martial arts, or even super powered, just two fighting for their lives. Matt gets the upperhand, deckin Andrew and driving him to the ground, and suddenly the co car (our POV), lifts off. WE GO FLYING INTO MATT, crashing out the camera as he tur and creates a telekinetic wall.
