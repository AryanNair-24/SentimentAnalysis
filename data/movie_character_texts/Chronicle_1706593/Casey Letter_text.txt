Andrew, talking fast and jerky, gestures towards his burns. Matt tries to reply several times, but Andrew isn't hearing it. Matt smiles nervously at the destruction, and says something gently. Andrew replies, and whatever is said here, it causes a radical shift in Matt's demeanor. He's no longer concerne he seems repulsed. Andrew says more, clearly SCREAMING at Matt. Matt seems to beg Andrew for something and Andrew relents Matt continues, more forcefully, and then notices somethi to his right. A BUS SMASHES HIM OUT OF THE AIR, SWATTING LIKE A BUG INTO THE SIDE OF AN APARTMENT COMPLEX. Andrew suddenly turns, flailing an arm at us in the chopp a mailbox comes CRASHING UP INTO THE CAMERA.
