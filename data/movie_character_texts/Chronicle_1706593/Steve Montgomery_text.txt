13) 33) dialog: Make it change again!    This is awesome! Matt presses with his palms. There's a low sustained hiss the light clouds turn an angry shade of red. A stream of them is released from beneath the structure. The camera jerks suddenly, revealing Steve, who's clutching his ears
13) 34) dialog: 
14) 8) dialog: I'm sorry, oh shit, I'm sorry-
