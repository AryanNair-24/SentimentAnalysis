Andrew, talking fast and jerky, gestures towards his burns. Matt tries to reply several times, but Andrew isn't hearing it. Matt smiles nervously at the destruction, and says something gently. Andrew replies, and whatever is said here, it causes a radical shift in Matt's demeanor. He's no longer concerne he seems repulsed. Andrew says more, clearly SCREAMING at Matt. Matt seems to beg Andrew for something and Andrew relents Matt continues, more forcefully, and then notices somethi to his right.
