Wump, wump, wump. He looks swollen in his pillowed coat, workin well-used ARMY MAN into the mound. His name is BAILEY. His nose running, his breath clouding before his face, he wholly focused on this very serious work until... He looks up. Sees something. Freezes. A WOLF. Just emerged from the trees. Motionless. Yellow e fixed on Bailey, her own breath steaming. She’s huge. ON BAILEY, seen from behind, looking out at the WOLF, onl forty feet away. Watching him in silence.

Just the field of white, the fading daylight all the way to the darkness of the trees. CUT TO BLACK. IN BLACKNESS, A WOLF HOWL carries from some far unknowabl place...but then morphs into a DRONING ELECTRIC BUZZ... INT. KITCHEN - CORE’S HOME - NIGHT Which is a MICROWAVE, a TV dinner turning inside until it beeps! and MALE HANDS gingerly remove it. INT. MAIN ROOM - CORE’S HOME - NIGHT A PAINTING OF A WOLF, an amateur work. From 0.S., we hear MAN, apparently leaving a voicemail message...
7) 0) text: Core settles into his recliner, thumbing idly through the mail until...this one LETTER in particular. KEELUT, AK, reads the return address. A childlike scrawl. Confused, he opens it, unfolds the single page, begins to read. And the color drains from his face. MACRO ON THE LETTER, we’re reading it, ‘DEARMR CORE, THRE AGO MY SON BAILEY WAS TAKEN BY WOLVES’ even as we hear--

46) 0) text: A SINGLE BARE BULB dangles from the low ceiling. Core comes carefully down the steps, stooped to keep from bumping his head, taking in the space: Wooden crates. Mason jars of dried foods. Lumber, visquee rodent droppings on the floor. And something else. Core stares at it, his breath fogging of him as a confused kind of horror pools on his face. He steps forward. Tucked upright into a shadowy nook, there is some kind of PLASTIC-WRAPPED COCOON. He seems to already know what it It’s Bailey. Core folds the plastic back to see his face. Frozen, blue mouth ajar as if to inhale, eyes half-lidded and iced ove Core wants to scream but doesn’t know how. 31. As gently as he can, he removes the plastic-wrapped bundl the boy’s body and lays it on the floor of the cellar. He finds a FOLDED BLANKET and carefully covers Bailey up. He sits on a crate beside it and weeps.
47) 6) dialog: --and Cheeon sprints past him, up towards the Slone cabin Core sways in the road, dizzied, looking at the VILLAGERS Some are Yup’ik, some are white, some mixed. Odd clashing clothes: animal hide mukluks and NFL jackets, like that. None of them say a word, none of them betray any emotion. Core just stands there shaking his head until he notices. ILLANAQ, at the rear of the crowd. He points at her...

He replaces the blanket, stands (having to stoop low, tal he is) to face the Villagers and Core waiting behind him.

Leaning against a tree, a .30-06 REMINGTON RIFLE, and bes it, a LIGHTWEIGHT .22. TWO PAIRS OF BARE FEET dangle in a SHALLOW CREEK. That’s gurgling we hear. It’s Vernon Slone: healthy, uninjured, smoking. Beside hi eating a cold egg sandwich in wax paper, is Bailey. So th is some other time. Their conversation is full of pauses.

Slone and Cheeon hop out, moving fast. A PICK AXE and a SHOVEL are yanked out. CHOPPING into the HILL in a tight, steady rhythm--kak, kak, kak, kak--until SHALLOW SLOT is cleared. Cheeon shoulders a RECTANGULAR WOODEN BOX from the truck plain but expertly crafted, and fits it into the slot. And then Slone moves to the truck, slowing as he bends to remove BAILEY’S BLANKET-WRAPPED BODY. He lays him gently inside the BOX, folds the blanket back removes his glove...and lays his hand on Bailey for a mom 45. He replaces the blanket and turns away, blasted white in HEADLIGHTS as he moves back towards the truck while Cheeo in the background, power drills a lid onto the box. VZZ2Z

Time is brok INSTANT COFFEE, boiling water going into a mug. A SANDWICH, hard bread and cold cuts slapped together, Sl chewing mechanically, gulping coffee. IN THE BEDROOM MIRROR he peels off his bandage and applie antiseptic cream to his HEALING GUNSHOT WOUND. A CUPBOARD is opened and Slone (now with a fresh bandage his neck) retrieves a 9MM HANDGUN and BOX OF AMMO. A DUFFEL BAG is opened and the 9MM, a 12 GAUGE AUTOLOADER REMINGTON RIFLE, the AR-15 and VARIOUS AMMO go inside. THE COMPOUND BOW is grabbed, a QUIVER of arrows. FROM A FOOTLOCKER, socks, leggings, Maglite, binoculars. FROM A DRAWER, a POLAROID PHOTO: Medora, posed on the edg a river in hiking gear, smiling awkwardly. A WICKER BASKET, pawing inside it until he brings back a of MEDORA’S UNDERWEAR. He inhales them, precisely. And then sees something else, bends to get it...one of BAILEY’S LITTLE T-SHIRTS. His hand closes tightly on it. EXT. ILLANAQ’S HUT - NIGHT ILLANAQ waits before her hut, FIRELIGHT crackling behind for a semi-silhouette. She sees something and shuffles ba inside because... Slone is coming this way, inexorably, through the snow. INT. ILLANAQ’S HUT - SAME Illanagq sits by her fireplace, a halved oil drum turned its side. Pelts, cordwood, leather-bound books as furnitu She holds a faceless HEX DOLL for comfort. THE WIND stirs sparks and then Slone is sitting across fr her, firelight gleaming on the blade of his Bowie knife. 47.
