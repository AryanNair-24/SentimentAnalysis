A low insulated ceiling with plastic sheets duct taped over the windows. A pair of FUR-LINED BOOTS, knee-high and heavy, wait by front door where an AR-15 RIFLE is propped in the umbrell stand. A child’s .22 RIFLE leans in the corner. A CB RADIO hangs from a peg next to the CLOSET DOOR with PADLOCK on it. No phone that we can see. There’s a ratty COUCH with unfolded laundry on it. A soot FIREPLACE smolders with a COMPOUND BOW hung above the man And like an afterthought, a CRUDE MASK rests on the mantl made of driftwood and pelt. A wolf face. We find the WOMAN, sitting very still in a threadbare cha wearing a thick wool sweater, an untouched cup of tea in lap. Her name is MEDORA SLONE (30). Underfed, distant, with striking white-blond hair and pale, grey-gold eyes. She's just staring. At nothing, it seems. The wind keens faintly outside. The house creaks. Finally, she looks up.

7) 1) dialog: Dear Mr. Core, Three days ago my son Bailey was taken by wolves. He reads, horribly spellbound...
7) 2) dialog: This happened twice already here. I tried to track them but could not. No one in the village will hunt them. I am alone here now. I have read your book. I know you have done this before. In my heart, I know that you are able to do it now. I do not expect you to find my son alive. But you could find his bones and maybe slaughter the wolf that took him. My husband will come home from the war soon. I must have something to show him. I can't just have nothing. I know you have sympathy for this animal. Please don't. Come and kill it to help me. My son's bones are in the snow. He sits there, surrounded by all those paintings.

He sees distant shapes of CARIBOU moving along frozen wat He sees WHIRLS of snowy wind, miniature sideways tornados He sees a LONE FIGURE in a DOG SLED whisking across the plains, drawn by a bounding team of HUSKIES. He drives onward. Medora’s FOLDED LETTER rides shotgun.

Maybe a welcome, maybe a warning. As he gets closer The door opens. Medora Slone appears, uncertainly, holdin dog-eared PAPERBACK BOOK to herself. A moment, the two of them looking at each other across th distance to her door. FROM OVER MEDORA’S SHOULDER, we see her lift the book, consult the AUTHOR’S PHOTO on the back: it’s that Yellows picture we saw in Core's house. 10.

Her sk is rubbed raw and she MUTTERS angry, unknowable words. Ashamed, Core drops his eyes and backs away. He returns to the couch, gets under the quilt and rolls o to face away from the bedroom. But then... He hears the DOOR open. Hears quiet FOOTSTEPS in the room Rolls back over to see... MEDORA, glistening wet, naked by the window, tearing away plastic so the room now swells in ghastly blue moonlight. She turns to face him. She has the WOLF MASK on her face. He stares at her a long moment, terrified and heartbroken utterly unsure what to do. She removes the mask, drops it carelessly. Goes to him. P the quilt back, slips under the covers, facing out. He tries to give her space but there’s nowhere for him to She pulls his arm over her, above the covers. So he holds her like that, two spoons, unable to see the she stares out at the moonlight. Pleadingly? It’s not sex, just warmth. But then, slowly, she guides h HAND up to her THROAT...and holds it there. Tightly. Like willing him to squeeze as her tears spill in silence. Together, they gaze out the WINDOW...

IN THE BEDROOM MIRROR he peels off his bandage and applie antiseptic cream to his HEALING GUNSHOT WOUND. A CUPBOARD is opened and Slone (now with a fresh bandage his neck) retrieves a 9MM HANDGUN and BOX OF AMMO. A DUFFEL BAG is opened and the 9MM, a 12 GAUGE AUTOLOADER REMINGTON RIFLE, the AR-15 and VARIOUS AMMO go inside. THE COMPOUND BOW is grabbed, a QUIVER of arrows. FROM A FOOTLOCKER, socks, leggings, Maglite, binoculars. FROM A DRAWER, a POLAROID PHOTO: Medora, posed on the edg a river in hiking gear, smiling awkwardly. A WICKER BASKET, pawing inside it until he brings back a of MEDORA’S UNDERWEAR. He inhales them, precisely. And then sees something else, bends to get it...one of BAILEY’S LITTLE T-SHIRTS. His hand closes tightly on it. EXT. ILLANAQ’S HUT - NIGHT ILLANAQ waits before her hut, FIRELIGHT crackling behind for a semi-silhouette. She sees something and shuffles ba inside because...

They shoulder their packs and the rifle, stand there for moment, solemnly staring down at Core. And then they walk past him, on out of the cave without another word. Grunting with pain and effort, Core rolls over to see out the CAVE OPENING where... OUT THERE, Slone and Medora walk away together, gradually disappearing into a blast of snowy wind.
