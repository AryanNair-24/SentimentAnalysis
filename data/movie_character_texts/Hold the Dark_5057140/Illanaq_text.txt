Filthy anorak, long braided hair. She’s Yup’ the indigenous people of Keelut. CORE’S RENTAL SUV appears slowly up the main (indeed, the only) road of Keelut, pausing now below the totem pole. He rolls down his window, calls up to her...

Closer, he realizes it’s ILLANAQ. She’s burning trash ite in an oil drum, another FIRELIGHT glowing inside her hut. Drawing up to her, she speaks without looking at him...

35) 3) dialog: Say its meaning.
35) 5) dialog: “Evil spirit disguised as dog. Or wolf.”
35) 7) dialog: (shrugs, returns to her work) You’re the wolf expert, I hear. Annoyed and discomfited, Core continues on past her. She calls to his back...

Time is brok INSTANT COFFEE, boiling water going into a mug. A SANDWICH, hard bread and cold cuts slapped together, Sl chewing mechanically, gulping coffee. IN THE BEDROOM MIRROR he peels off his bandage and applie antiseptic cream to his HEALING GUNSHOT WOUND. A CUPBOARD is opened and Slone (now with a fresh bandage his neck) retrieves a 9MM HANDGUN and BOX OF AMMO. A DUFFEL BAG is opened and the 9MM, a 12 GAUGE AUTOLOADER REMINGTON RIFLE, the AR-15 and VARIOUS AMMO go inside. THE COMPOUND BOW is grabbed, a QUIVER of arrows. FROM A FOOTLOCKER, socks, leggings, Maglite, binoculars. FROM A DRAWER, a POLAROID PHOTO: Medora, posed on the edg a river in hiking gear, smiling awkwardly. A WICKER BASKET, pawing inside it until he brings back a of MEDORA’S UNDERWEAR. He inhales them, precisely. And then sees something else, bends to get it...one of BAILEY’S LITTLE T-SHIRTS. His hand closes tightly on it. EXT. ILLANAQ’S HUT - NIGHT ILLANAQ waits before her hut, FIRELIGHT crackling behind for a semi-silhouette. She sees something and shuffles ba inside because... Slone is coming this way, inexorably, through the snow. INT. ILLANAQ’S HUT - SAME Illanagq sits by her fireplace, a halved oil drum turned its side. Pelts, cordwood, leather-bound books as furnitu She holds a faceless HEX DOLL for comfort. THE WIND stirs sparks and then Slone is sitting across fr her, firelight gleaming on the blade of his Bowie knife. 47.
62) 1) dialog: You come to punish the old witch, Vernon Slone? I’m no witch. You think I knew? You think I could have stopped her? An old woman? Slone says nothing. She spits on her own floor, smirks.
62) 2) dialog: Go to your father’s grave and ask him. Take your wrath to the gods, to the wolves. To yourself and end it. Slone says nothing. She rattles the hex doll at him, as i scold him.
62) 3) dialog: That boy’s fate was foretold in the ice. So was hers. And yours. You should have died there in the sand but you did not accept that. You came home to see. Slone says nothing. She shifts, growing less sure, less haughty. She reaches for a PILL BOTTLE, swallows one dry.
62) 4) dialog: This is not the first time the wolves came. Before, the white men called it influenza. We called it peelak. I was a little girl. Half the village, their bodies in igloos on the hill, for proper burial after breakup. I pulled them there on my father’s sled. But the wolves came at night and broke the igloos. In the morning, the hillside was scattered with the pieces of their bodies. There is no proper burial after that. That is our history here. Slone says nothing. She pleads in a whisper...
