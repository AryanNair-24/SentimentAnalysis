Glimpses of tinsel, and a transparent peignoir momentaril hide a large pair of sagging breasts swinging from side t side and bouncing up and down. Dead silence as the moveme gradually speeds up to real time. We slowly pull back to reveal that our image is that of a giant nude woman dress in nothing but tiny bits of glitter, white vinyl boots an small tulle cape. She is gyrating madly and flinging her around in some sort of windstorm. As we pull back further come to understand that what we are looking at is an art installation: a floor to ceiling LCD screen.

Ther a very slight hint of panic on her face as she stares acr the crowded, brightly lit room. Abruptly our sound snaps on at a deafening decibel level we hear what seems like a thousand voices screaming over other. The screens cover the four walls of the gallery and the effect of wall to wall, floor to ceiling breast and ass jiggling is oddly impressive. The obese women on the LCD screens are nude but dressed in bits and pieces of Americ one is playing the part of a cheerleader with red tinsel poms, one a majorette twirling a baton while another wear beauty queen’s ribbon and waves small American flags.

These women appear to be dead and are lying face down. Nude except for jewelry, shoes and small bits of tinsel wrapped around their ankles and waists. The room is jammed with people laughing and talking. The crowd is a collection of what passes in contemporary Los Angeles culture as the chic and fashionable.

11) 33) dialog: It’s true. They’re pretty narrow. They look at us as just an extension of themselves. They can’t accept Cooper for who he is. I’m not sure how I will fare. 53.
11) 35) dialog: No. I don’t think so. They have a pretty antiquated idea about how I am supposed to live my life. My mother especially.

12) 22) dialog: Oh my god, did you just say that? You really just said that? That came out of your mouth?
12) 24) dialog: Weak isn’t the word I would use to describe Edward. Sensitive is the word I would use and that’s certainly not a word that I could ever use to describe anyone in this family, except maybe Cooper. 59.
