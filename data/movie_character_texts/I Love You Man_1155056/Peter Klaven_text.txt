I did it for you at first, but, I had no idea what I was missing. Do you know that I haven’t taken a Zantac in three weeks?

43) 5) dialog: Buddy, let me throw something out here. I’m thinking the glasses and hat might be getting in the way of your social life.

43) 16) dialog: Well, are you happy about that? Bummed? Give me something other than, ‘Okay.’
43) 18) dialog: I don’t think that’s the case. You guys just haven’t spent that much time together. But, I’1l talk to him.
43) 20) dialog: Why not?
43) 22) dialog: But you are saying shit about him.
43) 24) dialog: Okay.
43) 26) dialog: Um, yeah, I mean, I can move some stuff around.
43) 28) dialog: No, I was just gonna meet up with Sydney. It’s fine, I'll move it.

44) 41) dialog: Sydney’s a hot-head. He thought he was standing up for me.
44) 43) dialog: I believe I did.
44) 45) dialog: I probably have to let it go. I was counting on the commission for the down payment.
44) 47) dialog: No. Between the wedding, and, then I lent Sydney some money, I’m just a little short.
44) 49) dialog: For an investment. All his money was tied up in equities, so... I mean, he’s going to pay me back.
44) 51) dialog: Can I ask you something? Why do you think we’re getting married?
44) 53) dialog: Sydney asked me the question, you know, ‘Why Zooey?’ And I... of course I love you, but, I’m not exactly sure how to answer that.

45) 5) dialog: Pretty awesome?! “The Fastest Realtor In The West?!” “The Market’s So Bright, He’s Gotta Wear Shades?!” They’re idiotic! I’1l be the laughing stock of the entire real estate industry!
45) 7) dialog: Look, I appreciate the gesture, but, why didn’t you just tell me?
45) 9) dialog: Sydney, in one day you’ve screwed up my career, ruined my relationship--
45) 11) dialog: I am so goddamn sick of your ridiculous codes! ‘You can’t tell women this.’ ‘It’s bro’s before ho’s.’ Sydney, I like sharing stuff with Zooey. I like spending time just hanging out with her. You know that my favorite night in the last five years is when she and I stayed home, made a summer salad, and watched CHOCOLAT together. And it was my pick at Blockbuster!
45) 13) dialog: Look, I think we need some time apart.
45) 15) dialog: Us. This. Whatever it is we’re doing here. It’s not working out.
45) 17) dialog: Right, so, I think it’s probably best, that, uh... if I do actually have a wedding... (this is hard for him) ...that you not be there.
45) 19) dialog: And, if you could have those billboards taken down--
45) 21) dialog: No rush. Oh, and I think you have my season two LOST dvd’s. I mean, if you haven’t watched them, you could just--

47) 3) dialog: No, somewhere public, like a restaurant, or Pinkberry. One of the reasons I like to come here with women is they know me. I’m familiar with the menu. I’m comfortable here. Dating is stressful enough, you want to try to control your environment as much as possible.
47) 5) dialog: Girls I’m pretty good at. Guys, not so much. I gotta run to the bathroom, I’1l be right back. BY THE MEN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Peter waits for the Men’s Room to open up.

47) 17) dialog: Zooey, I know why I want to marry you.
47) 19) dialog: The truth is, I have been a girlfriend guy, but, you’re the first woman I’ve ever been with who really wants me to have my own life. (MORE )
47) 21) dialog: I have to come clean, I heard you talking about me at that ladies night a couple months ago.
47) 23) dialog: Oh. Okay, well, I thought you wanted me to have friends for you, but, I’m pretty positive you actually wanted that for me. And, that’s one of the most romantic things I can ever imagine. So, can we get this engagement back on track.
47) 25) dialog: By the way, I ended things with Sydney.
47) 27) dialog: I didn’t. He can be a great guy, but, it just wasn’t working out. And we FADE UP a slow, acoustic version of the classic Qu song, “You’re My Best Friend,” over the following: EXT.

52) 5) dialog: Really? No insights about the fact that I’1l be sleeping with the same women for the rest of my life?
