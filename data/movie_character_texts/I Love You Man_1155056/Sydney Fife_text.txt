18) 4) dialog: I’m the first one, huh? I don’t know why people are so afraid of chowing down at an Open House. (beat) So, how come Ferrigno’s selling?
18) 6) dialog: It’s a great pad. I’m not sure I'd keep the Pumping Iron posters, but--
18) 8) dialog: Sydney Fife.
18) 10) dialog: (points to the Hollywood couple) You were wasting your time with those two, by the way.
18) 12) dialog: I saw that guy pulling in. He drives a Volkswagon Passat. That's a thirty thousand dollar car, and he’s looking at a 4.3 million dollar house? Doesn’t compute. He hasn’t been dating the girl he’s with for more than two weeks, maybe three. In fact, from their body language, I doubt he’s slept with her yet. (MORE )
18) 14) dialog: So, he tells her he’s looking for a new house, brings her along, hoping to impress her, which he might, ‘cause she doesn’t look like the sharpest monkey in the monkey house, then he’1l sleep with her at her rental in Toluca Lake, go back to his one bedroom in Studio City, having done nothing but gotten laid while wasting your valuable time.
18) 18) dialog: Me, I’m going tell you right up front, I have no intention of buying this house whatsoever.
18) 20) dialog: Pete, I am here, on a beautiful Saturday afternoon, to eat your free food and try to pick up a divorcee. Peter laughs, shakes his head.
18) 22) dialog: Iam. At the classier Open Houses, the spread is usually delicious, plus, aside from the poser douchebags like the dude who just left, you normally get a delightful panoply of financially solvent, newly single women.
18) 24) dialog: Thank you, sir. Is there anymore Russian Dressing? Peter stares at Sydney - ‘Is this guy for real?’
19) 1) dialog: .-.I do private investments. Manage my own portfolio. It’s great. I work from home, keep my own hours.
19) 3) dialog: I’m not exactly flying private, but yeah, I do nicely. The thing I ask myself, is, can I afford my lifestyle? If the answer is yes, I’m happy. The Europeans have it right... they work to live, not the other way around. I tend to adhere to a more Continental way of thinking.
19) 5) dialog: You ever been to Italy? 37.
19) 7) dialog: So, you know... those people enjoy their lives way more than we do over here.
19) 9) dialog: Alright, man, I’m gonna fix myself another sammy, then I have an Open House in Bel Air that promises to be replete with Cougars. Nice to meet you.
19) 11) dialog: Sounds good. Here, you might as well take mine too. They exchange cards. Peter eyes Sydney’s, which reads: SYDNEY FIFE INVESTMENTS, LLC. They shake hands.
19) 12) dialog: Thanks for a great Open House, Pete. Peter watches Sydney exit, clearly intrigued by this guy.
21) 0) text: Peter sits at his desk, staring at Sydney’s card. He pick up the phone, hangs up before he dials.
21) 2) dialog: This is Sydney Fife. You know what to do. Peter affects a business-like tone.
21) 49) dialog: So why’d you call it quits with your last girlfriend?
21) 52) dialog: Oof. Those are the worst.
21) 54) dialog: She was a golfer?
21) 56) dialog: Yeah, no, I get it. I’ve just always wondered if having a girlfriend who could join you for eighteen would be a blessing or a curse. Anyway, go on...
21) 58) dialog: Really? No laj in between the vag?
21) 60) dialog: You didn’t have any lag time between women?
21) 64) dialog: How's the sex?
21) 66) dialog: You’re going to be making love to one woman for the rest of your life. So, is it good?
21) 68) dialog: Not really. It’s something we all think about on a minute by minute basis, but, we’re not supposed to talk about it? Why? Beat. Peter thinks about this.
21) 70) dialog: Your voice when up when you said that.
21) 72) dialog: It means, you weren't being entirely truthful. What’s the deal?
21) 74) dialog: Getting in it the tush?
21) 76) dialog: She doesn’t like it when you go down on her?
21) 78) dialog: ‘Cause you're speaking honestly.
21) 80) dialog: Iwas. I got devoed a year ago. We started out great, but, Leanne got too needy. Never gave me my space. I finally said ‘enough.’
21) 82) dialog: It was rough for a while, but, the truth is, Pistol, I’ve never been happier.
21) 84) dialog: Pete Maravich. Great basketball player. Nickname was The Pistol. A YOUNG COUPLE hovers over their table -- as is tradition this restaurant where you have to fight for a seat.
21) 86) dialog: Sorry, chief, we’re actually staying for dinner. Peter’s eyes widen. 47.
21) 88) dialog: Dude, are you serious? They literally have the best burgers in the world here. If you get a seat at Father’s Office, you do not leave without eating. Peter’s clearly considering it.
21) 93) dialog: All good?
21) 96) dialog: People say it’s the meat, but I agree, the onions set it apart.
21) 98) dialog: Dude, you only had like three pints. You’ll be fine. My Vespa blew a tire on the way over. You mind giving me a ride home? INT. PETER’S CAR - NIGHT Peter drives. Sydney rides shotgun.
21) 100) dialog: The guy’s a phony. Had you ever heard of him before The Satanic Verses?
21) 102) dialog: Butt cheeks. He was a struggling novelist who wrote a book that he knew was gonna drive the Ayatollah crazy, get him a ton of publicity in the process, and sure enough, the guy puts a fatwa on his head. Next thing you know, he’s an international celebrity, writing songs with Bono, he marries the hot chick from Top Chef, lives like a king in some four star London hotel... on the government’s dime.
21) 104) dialog: Wanted it? The man loved every goddamn minute of that fatwa. I guarantee you, he begged the Ayatollah not to take the price off his head. A SIREN behind them flashes onto their car.
21) 106) dialog: Stay calm and let me do the talking.
21) 108) dialog: Peter, relax, it’s gonna be okay. Peter pulls the car over. A COP approaches.
21) 114) dialog: Yes, we have, friend.
21) 116) dialog: We had a few pints at a bar in Santa Monica. My buddy’s wife just left him for a Mexican guy. He walked in on the two of them banging in his laundry room.
21) 118) dialog: If that’s not bad enough, she tells him she’s taking the kids, all the savings, moving down to freakin’ Guadalajara with this yag-off. So, I dragged my man out, got hima little toasted to try to balm the pain. He’s probably one drink over the limit, two-max. Beat. Then...
21) 120) dialog: You said something there, my brother. Steal our jobs. Steal our women. Where does it end?
21) 124) dialog: The cop had an indentation where his wedding ring used to be, so I figured the cheating spouse angle was a good bet. The Mexican part, was an assumption that he was a racist, based on his buzz-cut, vocal intonation, and general demeanor.
21) 126) dialog: Just so you know, and I’m serious about this, I have no problems with Mexicans whatsoever. I was just trying to get you out of a DUI.
21) 129) dialog: Uh, no, why would I be?
21) 131) dialog: Look, Pete, maybe this is weird to admit, but, you seemed like a good dude. I was just... seeing if you wanted to get a beer.
21) 133) dialog: Me too. Peter looks over, they exchange a quick smile, drive on. INT. PETER AND ZOOEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT In the bedroom, Zooey is sleeping. Peter tiptoes in. Zooe speaks in that half-asleep voice.
23) 18) dialog: Hello?
23) 20) dialog: Who? 58.
23) 22) dialog: Hey, man. What’s going on?
23) 24) dialog: I’m about to take my Puggle for a jaunt on the Venice Boardwalk. Why don’t you join me for some eats?
24) 0) text: Peter joins Sydney as he walks his PUGGLE.
24) 1) dialog: He’s a cross between a Beagle and a Pug. Greatest dog in the world.
24) 3) dialog: Anwar Sadat. After Anwar Sadat. The former President of Egypt.
24) 5) dialog: No, I was looking at an old issue of TIME magazine with Sadat on the cover when he was a puppy, it was uncanny how much they looked alike. Peter eyes Anwar Sadat, not quite seeing the resemblance.
24) 6) dialog: So, how’s Ferrigno coming? Any offers? 59.
24) 8) dialog: And split the commission? What about that land you want to develop?
24) 10) dialog: The guy sounds like a douche. Who needs him?
24) 12) dialog: Bullshit. That’s the insecurity talking. The way you set-up that Open House was understated, classy and elegant. Those sandwiches you put out were delicious.
24) 14) dialog: No, Pete, trying is having the intention to fail. You gotta scratch that word from your vocab. Say you'll do it. And you will. As Peter considers this, Anwar the Puggle squats down and poops. When he finishes, Sydney starts walking away.
24) 16) dialog: Nah, I don’t pick up after my dog.
24) 18) dialog: It’s a ridiculous rule. Dog poop is like compost. It has an enormous amount of nutrients that enrich the soil. Just then, a MALE JOGGER, steps in Anwar’s shit.
24) 20) dialog: 
24) 24) dialog: (totally calm) I’m aman, Peter. I have an ocean of testosterone flowing through my veins. Society implores us to act civilized, keep everything under control. But, the fact is, we’re animals. And sometimes, we need to let it out. (then) Try it.
24) 26) dialog: Scream. Come on, you're stressed about the Ferrigno house. I guarantee you’re anxious about your wedding in ways you’re not even aware of. Let it out, you’ll feel better.
25) 0) text: Peter and Sydney are alone. Peter quietly screams.
25) 2) dialog: Okay, good. Now, gently remove your vagina and try it again.
25) 5) dialog: Mr. Klaven, welcome to the Temple of Doom. Peter takes it in, wide-eyed.
25) 8) dialog: (totally unembarrassed) Oh, that’s where I jerk off.
25) 10) dialog: I wear them while I masturbate. It decreases sensitivity, so I can last longer, and also there’s no mess to clean up.
25) 12) dialog: Uh, no, I’m absolutely serious.
25) 14) dialog: Pistol, this is a man-cave. No woman has ever been granted access.
25) 16) dialog: Masturbation is part of life. You’ve never talked about jerking off with any of your friends?
25) 18) dialog: When’s the last time you did it?
25) 20) dialog: What are you afraid of? I’m not going to tell anyone. Think of this place as a cone of silence. Just then, 63.
25) 22) dialog: What’d you use? Internet? DVD?
25) 24) dialog: An old porno VHS tape?
25) 26) dialog: You jerked off to a picture of your own girlfriend?! Are you sick?!
25) 28) dialog: Pedro, it is wrong in so many ways, I can’t even begin to describe it. Peter’s cell-phone rings. He picks it up.
25) 30) dialog: Why’d you tell her you bailed from work?
25) 32) dialog: I’m honest with my friends. With women, it’s a whole different thing.
25) 34) dialog: No, it’s not. There’s stuff you share with dudes you could never tell your girlfriend or wife.
25) 36) dialog: Okay, so, when you go home you’1l tell Zooey that you jerked off to her picture last weekend?
25) 38) dialog: But, you just revealed that to me. Sydney shrugs. Outplayed, Peter’s got no response. He wal over to the cluster of MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS in the corner. There’s a poster for the band RUSH on the wall behind the drumset.
25) 40) dialog: I’m a drummer. A stick-man. You play an instrument?
25) 42) dialog: Oh, were you in a band?
25) 44) dialog: Dude! Best rock band in the world! Neil Peart, hands down, greatest stick-man who ever lived. We should jam sometime.
25) 46) dialog: Coolio. I gotta get to bed early. I’m taking a day-hike in Malibu with some of my buddies tomorrow. Peter is clearly taken aback by this revelation.
25) 48) dialog: (off Peter's vibe) You’re welcome to join us.
25) 50) dialog: Adios, Pistol.
27) 6) dialog: The Hulk busting your balls?
27) 8) dialog: My sperm bank is a few blocks away on Westwood.
27) 10) dialog: No, I deposit every couple of weeks. I may as well get paid for something I’m gonna do at home anyway.
27) 12) dialog: I got some leftover Koo-Koo Roo at the house, you want to get some lunch, squeeze in a little jam session?
27) 14) dialog: What do you have, acid reflux?
27) 16) dialog: Dude, you’re not going to get anything done in this state. You need to get some grub and let out a little steam. I guarantee, you'll be more focused when you get back to the office.

37) 20) dialog: He became the Dalai Lama when he was two years old. He didn’t win some kind of Dalai Lama election. He was a baby.

41) 15) dialog: Here, give this one a shot.
41) 17) dialog: You have this image of yourself as this tight, by-the-book guy, but, I’ve seen you let loose in the Temple of Doom. It’s the same thing with the Ferrigno house -- you have the skills, you just don’t have the confidence. Try it on. Peter reluctantly heads back into the dressing room with new tux. As he and Syd talk, we INTERCUT between dressing room and waiting area.
