A distorted old breath comes from under THE RED HOOD, wheezing, trying to keep pace. From a little lower in the cloak comes the sound of a gargling BABY. One of SAMUEL'S HANDS pokes out. Dusk is at its end. INT. THE WITCH’S HOVEL - NIGHT DARKNESS. It is almost impossible to see. Passing through the shadows, extremely old and bent HANDS with long dirty talons briefly catch the firelight. They place SAMUEL upon the center of a crude table. Overwhelme the dark, he senses the danger. His delicate baby FINGERS open and close reflexively, grasping at the air. Seen in flickering glimpses, the greasy RED CLOAK falls t the dirt floor. TINY FEET step around THE CLOAK and kick square-toed shoes. Jagged, fungal toe-nails poke out of soiled wool stockings. THE OLD HANDS grab the BABY’S COLLAR, tear open his linen shift, and strip it off the child. SAMUEL starts to cry. THE FIGURE steps away from the table, her back to camera.

She removes the rest of he filthy clothes, and for an instant, HER NAKED BODY is revealed... before she moves back into shadow. HER HANDS reach up to the low THATCH CEILING, over THE BA and tear out a mossy clump. Little bits of dirt and reed, other natural scantlings fall on SAMUEL. BRIGHT MOONLIGHT shines through the hole, bathing the child in its light. OFF SCREEN, THE OLD WOMAN hums a haunting song. Her HANDS stroke the baby tenderly and pinches the fatty areas arou his thighs and biceps. Her HAND take a LARGE RUSTY KNIFE... she holds it up over child's breast... she continues to hum her song... CAMERA ON: The humpback and scabby head of THE OLD WOMAN. She brings the knife up... and then down in a swift motio (WE DO NOT SEE THE BABY, only the back of THE OLD WOMAN) 10. AUDIO: CHOP! THE BABY WAILS.

She puts to a dying ember and the taper illuminates her face. In front of her is THE SILVER CUP! How can this be? She leans toward it... THE BABY GIGGLES again.
