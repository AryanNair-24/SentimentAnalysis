Seven-eighths of the Earth's land  mass will be deluged with hot magma.   Tectonic plates will shift, causing  massive earthquakes.  Imagine no  United Kingdom.  Think of it, no  cricket, no tea, no freshly toasted  crumpets smothered with Devonshire  clotted cream, the diving mystery of  Stonehenge.  Imagine severing forever  the continuity of Britannic majesty,  the demise of this sceptered isle,  this jewel, this England...
