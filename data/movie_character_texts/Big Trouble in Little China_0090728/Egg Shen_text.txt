13) 57) dialog: Yes, I observed. Egg hands Kim a jade piece.
13) 58) dialog: Jade...magical. The only gemstone that changes color when you touch it. It reacts to body temperature, chemistry...some say...to the person himself. Or herself.
13) 90) dialog: Can't talk now. Good bye! Egg slams the door, heavy bolts CRASH SHUT. Steve's left alone, deserted in Little China.

18) 0) text: EGG SHEN lectures on Little China. The bus is painted in Chinese motifs finished in red lacquer. Egg looks down th streets, into alleys. He's distracted and lecturing half- heartedly. Steve sits nearby and questions, much to Egg's annoyance -- and to the mystification of the tourists.
18) 1) dialog: .No. Chinese men were brought over to work on the railroads. Women followed later but the first generations never really assimilated...
18) 3) dialog: Not true. Actually insulting to Chinese. There are, of course, no such things as demons, sorcery or magic ...within the Chinese scheme of beliefs. Chinese are very rational, law-abiding...

20) 2) dialog: In Chinatown? Of course not. Just as Egg says it, more Flame Lords burst from an alley sweep up the street, creating chaos. They overturn trashc knock over cyclists. They leap at the bus, run up the sid dance on the roof. Tourists SCREAM! Doors burst open. Fla Lords fly in.
20) 3) dialog: It's nothing. Don't be alarmed. Just a Lion Dance. All part of the show.
20) 5) dialog: Flame Lords! Begone! You cannot do this!
20) 8) dialog: Bok Sum! White Hearts! It's a Call To Arms. It echoes through...

31) 3) dialog: Worse. I'm ignoring you.
31) 5) dialog: Grasshopper was an ACTOR! Egg slams the door. Steve stands dripping in the rain. Th door opens.
31) 6) dialog: Am I supposed to be impressed by someone too dumb to get out of the rain?
31) 8) dialog: Confucius also said, ‘Get Lost! He slams the door.
42) 3) dialog: White Hearts!
42) 10) dialog: Yen Lo!! 51. The White Hearts are stunned to discover that the DEMON F LORDS HAVE VANISHED. Egg turns away, runs into his shop.
43) 2) dialog: (furious) Chi Lung?! Chi Lung cannot decree anything! Chi Lung appears in a burst of flame glaring imperiously.
43) 5) dialog: Two?!! How did he get two??

47) 6) dialog: (sarcastic) You just want to learn the magic.
47) 8) dialog: You can learn nothing unless your heart is true. Egg takes the jade, slips away... It's so fast, for a mom they don't realize he's gone. Then Steve runs to catch up
48) 3) dialog: Magic perhaps.
48) 6) dialog: Yes... it's a constant struggle to keep the ancient beliefs alive yet secret... and to find young people with the moral character to become guardians of the CHAI TAO. He looks intently at Kim. She turns away. Egg looks pensi
48) 9) dialog: It... is meant for you.
48) 11) dialog: If you are going to act so recklessly you must carry it at all times.
48) 14) dialog: You must!... (He's overstated something, backs off, to save face.) Please...
48) 23) dialog: No. Thank you. Egg smiles enigmatically, slips away. Kim and Steve look each other and the jade for an awkward moment. It GLOWS a PULSES. It SHIMMERS in her hand.

48) 39) dialog: You deny your heritage?
48) 41) dialog: Ahhhh...yes. You are overly rational. Not a common failing among women.
48) 45) dialog: If you really believed... one could pick it up in your bare hands ...that is, if you are truly worthy.
48) 47) dialog: Oh, it'll burn the hell out of you. You must have faith... or a comprehensive health plan. Egg looks at Steve critically, gauging his reaction. Steve picks up the fiery ember. Egg's intrigued. Steve glances at Kim, loses concentration, cries out, drops the coal.
48) 48) dialog: Of course, hot coals are a problem for those with short attention spans. 66. Egg picks up the coal, pops it into his mouth, swallows i He burps discreetly. A small flame bursts from his mouth.
48) 49) dialog: Excuse me. See, not just faith but heart. Otherwise all you'll wind up with is heartburn. Egg winks at Kim. He knows there is a growing attraction between Steve and Kim. Brad senses it too.
48) 80) dialog: You must treat the bad magic with contempt. {turns to Kim) You must also believe...
48) 82) dialog: Yes. It couldn't hurt. Kim closes her eyes, concentrates. The jade GLOWS.

51) 14) dialog: Trust the Chai Tao.
51) 16) dialog: You must! Chi Lung has to face the Judges of Hell. He doesn't have the complete puzzle. He'll stall ... maybe offer them virgin sacrifices for more demons. And to keep them amused.
