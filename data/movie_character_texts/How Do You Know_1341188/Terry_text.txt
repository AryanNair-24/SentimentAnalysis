17) 1) dialog: Maybe that’s better for tonight. I don’t know why I agreed to this delivery date..damn me and my need for approval. .Sorry. She slides into the cocoon -- no small feat.
17) 3) dialog: Anyway, I think I know what it is that's bothering you.. George is puzzled by this.
17) 4) dialog: (crossing to him.) If you're concerned about us now that we've intensified..we're okay. I am busy so I can’t demonstrate to you that we’re okay in all the little ways like paying attention to you..but if you could just take my word for it until the work lets up that would really help me... and us.

23) 23) dialog: (making her point) while you were talking, I related the weakness of gravity to your capacity for feeling good right now and how I would fail if I tried to be one of those machines for you. Using all my energy to produce a drop of well being in you. That‘s what I thought. George doesn’t follow at all.
23) 25) dialog: This is for us. I swear it. She kneels before his chair, looking up at him. Okay, may that’s not love light in her eyes but it sure contains so kindness and affection as it get to the core truth.

23) 32) dialog: No, you're misreading me. I’m rattled. (on his reaction) Yes..This is me rattled.
23) 34) dialog: I think I’m the best source for my own feelings. Calmly, studiously even, George goes to her desk and grab HER DATA PORT from the computer...she screams and shouts mother would for an endangered child..
