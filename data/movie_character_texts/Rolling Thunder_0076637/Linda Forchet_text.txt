Rane removes a .45 and closes the trunk. Plac- ing the .45 under the front seat, he walks back toward the house. In the KITCHEN Rane rummages about for some food, but can only find a package of stale OREOs. He picks up the pack- age and a quart of J&B and walks back toward the living room. In the BEDROOM, he removes a stack of twenty dollar bills which had been hidden under the dresser, There appears to be about $500. When he slips the wad of bills into his pants pocket, Charlie feels something unusual there. Fishing around in his pocket, he comes out with a piece of paper. It reads: Linda Forchet TR6-3265 He looks at the paper a moment and walks back toward the living room. As he passes the bed, we notice the medals are no longer lying on it. By the time he gets in the LIVING ROOM, he has his mind made up. He sits down and dials the phone. He waits for the phone to ring. It does, and a girl's pleasant Texas VOICE comes on the other end.

0) 218) dialog: Wow! I remember. Of course I know who you are, Col. Rane,
0) 220) dialog: (puzzled) I'm fine. How about you? I read about it in the papers. It was horrible...
0) 222) dialog: Where you going?
0) 224) dialog: There is?
0) 226) dialog: Gee, I really can't, you know, Colonel? I got a job. What would my boss say? I just can't up and leave.
0) 228) dialog: Well...
0) 230) dialog: I didn't say I was gonna come. 4g,
0) 232) dialog: Maybe...
0) 234) dialog: An hour?
0) 236) dialog: I don't get off work until five.
0) 238) dialog: I don't know why I'm doing ‘this.
0) 240) dialog: Okay, I'll figure out a way. Don't know how, though. But you can't meet me here. And I have to go home and get some things. My hair needs to get done, too.
0) 242) dialog: We can meet in the coffee shop on the corner by my apartment. That's the Eat-Rite coffee shop. The corner of 4th and Sam Houston. Right next to the Sav-More Drug Discount store.
0) 245) dialog: Hello, Lt. Colonel. Some car you got.
0) 247) dialog: I pretended I got sick. I said I had cramps. Here, you know. (hold lower abdomen) Woman-type sick. That always works. There is no immediate response from Rane so Linda picks up the thin conversational thread again:
0) 248) dialog: You don't give a person much time. (a beat) Where we going again?
0) 250) dialog: That's a greaseball town, right? Over the line? 50.
0) 252) dialog: What's there?
0) 254) dialog: Oh, Tammy Wy-nette. Linda turns up the radio. Rane drives up the ramp to the expressway. Putting his hand on Linda's bare knee, he says:
0) 258) dialog: Jesus, Charlie, we was going so fast the words blown right outa my mouth. They catch the stares of several truckers as they enter the INT. TRUCKSTOP. Feeling their stares, Rane cups Linda's left ham in a display of manly arrogance. Em- barrassed, Linda removes his hand from her ass. Rane slides into a vinyl booth and Linda plops down across from him. They appear on very amiable terms. Rane slides the menu toward him but doesn't look at it. Linda vainly tries to brush her windblown hair:
0) 259) dialog: Gee, I never thought you'd remember who I was.
0) 261) dialog: Golly, I'm just such a fool for Army men. Just show me anything in a uniform and I get all wet. (laughs at herself) I should be kept on a leash around Army bases.
0) 263) dialog: Yeah, I was an Army brat. Dad was stationed at the Naval Air Station in Beeville. Then he got promoted and we moved to Corpus. He always said I shoulda stayed Army. He was real upset when I married Sam.
0) 265) dialog: ‘Cause Sam was intellectual and all.
0) 267) dialog: Well, he just knew everything. He was real smart, not like me. I'm about as bright as a night- light. He'd made a gob of money in real estate and was handsome. The marriage wasn't his idea. I hit on him. But then he started getting into politics and dropped me like a hot potater. He's an aide to something or other now in Austin. I read his name once in the paper. Sometimes his mother calls -- she always liked me.
0) 269) dialog: Well, it wasn't so hot, I can tell you. Me about as sharp as a@ napkin and this guy always saying what is what. It was like that song, you know, "Satin sheets to lie on, satin pillows to cry on." That's Jeanne Pruit. Well I had them satin sheets up to here. (gestures) I mean Sam was important and all but he wasn't ever a real man. Never was. Just a talker. But I didn't do no worse than ny girlfriends. The ones that ain't unhappy jus' hang around the Naval Officers Club. 53.
0) 271) dialog: (shrugs } Well, you can meet some nice guys at the Officers Club. The waitress walks over:
0) 274) dialog: Make mine light on the ice cream, heavy on the mait. The waitress takes the order and leaves. Looking at the Jukebox selector in the booth, Linda searches for a coin in her purse. Rane pulls out a quarter and gives it to her.
0) 275) dialog: Thanks. Linda puts the quarter into the box.
0) 276) dialog: Damn. This is one of those new machines they got now. Only two plays for a quarter. That's a erime. I can't live without a jukebox. Linda pushes two selections and turns back to Charlie:
0) 277) dialog: You see, I suffered, too, Charlie. Loretta Lynn's "Fist City" comes on the box.
0) 280) dialog: She's a grandmother already.
0) 282) dialog: Kitty Wells? Hell no. She's got her own TV show. Every Saturday morning. "The Kitty Wells Show." It's with her whole family.
0) 284) dialog: Patsy Cline?
0) 286) dialog: I don't know anybody who died. Do you know all the new singers?
0) 288) dialog: Who do you know?
0) 290) dialog: Did you ever hear Susan Raye? She's real good.
0) 292) dialog: She's from California. Bakersfield. (MORE )
0) 294) dialog: She's got a song that goes: (sings) "I guess my heart has a mind of its own."
0) 296) dialog: And then there's Jeanne Pruit, and, let's see, Barbara Fairchild, "The Teddy Bear Song." And little Tanya Tucker. She's only 14 years old. Donna Fargo. Conny VanDyk.
0) 298) dialog: We should stop and get a stereo and some albums. I'il help you pick 'em. You missed a lot. A young child about 8 walks by the booth and spots Charlie's shiny stainless steel hand. He stops and stares at it. His mother calls reprimandingly from a nearby booth:
0) 320) text: The big red Cad hauls ass down U.S. 277. 100 mph, maybe more, The SOUNDTRACK plays on: "You better move your feet, If you don't want to eat, A meal that's called Fist City." TIMECUT: Rane and Linda pull into the Del Rio city limits. Population 10,000. Crossing through the town, they drive south toward the border, Rane pulis off the read and drives into the lot of the NO-TELL MOTEL. It is about 4:00 p.m. Linda, straightening her hair -- now a hopeless task, watches Charlie as he checks in, comes out with a key and walks into a nearby room. Linda picks up her overnight bag and follows. INSIDE the MOTEL ROOM Rane walks into the bathroom and washes his face and hands. Linda sets her bag down and flops onto the bed. The walls of the room are pink, the tufted bedspread purple, and a print of a bullfighter decorates one wall. Linda watches Charlie soulfully. "Her man" strips to the waist, and washes his sinewy trunk with a damp washcloth and redresses. Linda pulls up her thin yellow ribbed pullover just below her breasts, revealing a deliciously tanned band of skin. Kicking off her shoes, she sensuously sets her heels against the purple bedspread. Leaving the bathroom in a mess, Charlie walks back into the room and eyes Linda. Rane hack-coughs: he is not well. Seeing the messy bathroom, Linda says playfully:
0) 321) dialog: Don't you ever clean up behind yourself?
0) 323) dialog: Hey, whatcha doing? Don't you want me to come along?
0) 325) dialog: Where are you going?
0) 327) dialog: (shocked ) Boys Town! God! What are you going to do there?
0) 331) dialog: Help you?
0) 333) dialog: Don't know? Who are these men?
0) 335) dialog: (catching on) My God! Oh no. Not this. You just brought me along as a decoy, didn't you? You just’ want to usé me. Oh no,’ I'm about as slow as a Chinese funeral, I never catch on. 60.
0) 337) dialog: God, why do I always end up with the crazy men?
0) 339) dialog: Not me.
0) 341) dialog: Yeah, like bait in a trap.
0) 343) dialog: Well, I ain't got much choice, do I? cur TO: 61.
0) 346) dialog: Whatja mean, go in there? That's greaseballville in there. No decent person would go in there.
0) 348) dialog: I was willing to do something for you, Charlie, but not this. Let's go back. This is painful. Humiliating. Rane starts to run out of patience. There's no way, of course, he's going to go back. Instead of getting angry at Linda, however, he speaks with passion.
0) 350) dialog: You're crazy, Charlie. As crazy as a jaybird in the snow.
0) 352) dialog: I don't suppose anything can happen. Poor Linda. Here she goes again, 63.
0) 354) dialog: Yes. For you, Charlie, for you. She embraces him and they kiss. She is still embracing him as he reaches under the seat and pulls out his nickel-plated .45 automatic. He slips it into his shirt.
0) 358) dialog: I'm looking for Big Ed. I was sent here for him. Do you know him?
0) 369) dialog: I'm gonna be his girl. I was sent here.
0) 372) dialog: (uneasy) What?
0) 374) dialog: Big Ed wouldn't like that. 66.
0) 376) dialog: I can leave.
0) 397) dialog: Let me take care of this one my way.
0) 399) dialog: Is Billy Sanchez here?
0) 402) dialog: I'm looking for Big Ed. 70.
0) 404) dialog: I'm Big Ed's new gal. I met him up in Corpus. He told me to meet him here.
0) 406) dialog: You look pretty good to me, Billy S., but I'm already a day late for Big Ed and if he don't find me quick he's gonna get angry. Rane walks over to the bar and sits several patrons away from Linda.
0) 408) dialog: 
0) 411) dialog: Was T-Bird with them?
0) 413) dialog: Yeah. He drives a Ford wagon.
0) 415) dialog: Where are they? Tl.
0) 417) dialog: Where's that?
0) 419) dialog: Thanks, Billy. Thanks a lot.
0) 421) dialog: (smiling) Could be, Rane seems a little upset: his disciple has learned her lesson too well. He walks over-to Linda and Billy. He threateningly raises his sharpened hook to Billy's face and says:
0) 427) dialog: (astonished) Where do you think you're going?
0) 429) dialog: That's 450 miles! I'm pooped.
0) 431) dialog: In the car -~ at 110 miles per hour?
0) 433) dialog: (ironic) The grand concession. (a beat) What about food? I'm hungry.
0) 435) dialog: Sheeit. Don't you ever sleep in a bed?
0) 437) dialog: Charlie, Charlie. Chariie puts his trembling arms around her.
0) 439) dialog: I don't know why I throwed myself on you like that I was just sitting there listening to all you went through and I started getting excited and I could hardly stand it I had never done anything like that before except once and that was at a rodeo but normally I never would ‘cause I'm not like that and I got so embarrassed when they took the pictures what am I doing here... 76. Rane puts his hand on her mouth:
0) 441) dialog: Oh, Charlie, you're some kind of man. Some kind of man, FADE OUT. 17.
0) 445) dialog: (interrupting) Charlie? Rane, who had been lying back against the front seat staring at the heavens, turns and looks at Linda cuddled up beside him.
0) 447) dialog: Whatcha doing? 78.
0) 449) dialog: Oh. She cuddles up beside him and goes back to sleep.
0) 453) dialog: ‘Morning, ugly.
0) 455) dialog: Ah, Charlie, I've been thinking. About this trip and all.
0) 457) dialog: Don't you think it's going a little too far, huh? Shouldn't we be going back to Corpus? They're bound to be wondering where you are.
0) 459) dialog: Won't the doctors want to see you?
0) 461) dialog: I want to go back. I should get back. Let's go.
0) 463) dialog: (takes his arm) Great. They start walking toward the car. Reaching in his pocket Rane pulls out the wad of twenties. Pulling off several hundred dollars, he gives them to her.
0) 465) dialog: No, we were going to go back together. Rane nods his head silently "No" and holds out the money for her. 81.
0) 466) dialog: It isn't right. I shouldn't take your money.
0) 468) dialog: Won't you come back with me?
0) 470) dialog: I ain't sorry I done this, you know. Charlie looks pained. He says nothing.
0) 471) dialog: It was real though, huh?
0) 473) dialog: Charlie! Charlie! Wait for me! Charlie slams the Cadillac to a stop and backs to where Linda is standing. The station attendant stares in amazement. Rane, relieved, smiles as Linda gets in. He notices the station attendant watching:
0) 482) dialog: Where are you going, Charlie?
0) 484) dialog: No, you're not.
0) 487) dialog: No. Not yet at least. Youtre coming to bed with me. Youtre sleepy and need rest. Youtre still sick.
0) 490) dialog: Yeah. I got the razor. Charlie sits on the bed and Linda runs her hand across his tight stomach and chest.
0) 491) dialog: You know you don't have to go at all if you don't want to. He begins undressing her.
0) 493) dialog: You always sleep with your shoes on? Charlie flops his feet on the bed.
0) 496) dialog: I love you, too, Charlie. 85. TIMECUT: two hours later. Linda, naked, sits up in bed. Charlie, dressed and shaved, sits at the small writing table. In front of him is a spread-out map of El Paso and three guns «~ the two nickel-plated .45s and the Browning Double Barrel. Rane inspects, hefts and tests the guns. He loads them, Hearing Linda rustle in the bed, he turns around and smiles at her.
0) 497) dialog: (pause) I was serious about what I said, Charlie.
0) 499) dialog: About not having to go. You don't have to, you know. Rane says nothing. He gathers up his map and guns.
0) 502) dialog: "Roses are red, Violets are blue, A pie's got a crust, And so do you." Charlie can't help but laugh. He gives Linda an abbreviated military salute.
0) 522) dialog: Charlie! You're all right! What happened?
0) 524) dialog: No? .
0) 526) dialog: Oh?
0) 528) dialog: Wow! What's all that?
0) 530) dialog: Jesus, Charlie, you didn't have to do this.
0) 532) dialog: Where's a plug?
0) 534) dialog: What are we going to do now? Go back to Corpus?
0) 536) dialog: Put as many miles between me and Texas as I can. Let's go up north somewhere where it's cold. Where there's Eskimos and snow and people who never leave their houses. (a beat) And where they make love like bunnies all day. R. (smiles) Sounds great to me. Linda embraces him:
0) 537) dialog: I'm glad I stuck it out with you, Charlie.
0) 539) dialog: Where's that?
0) 541) dialog: Yes?
0) 570) dialog: Yes, I got a Japanese one. A Sony Triniton.
0) 612) dialog: Charlie?

0) 616) dialog: You coming back?
0) 618) dialog: Really? Charlie puts his arms around her: 102.
0) 620) dialog: Charite. They embrace. Rane breaks free and walks toward the awaiting red Cadillac with Johnny. He turns back and says to Linda:
