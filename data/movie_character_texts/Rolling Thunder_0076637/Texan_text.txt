He could not tell if he wanted to, He has lost his capacity to give in, As the Mexican's boots step toward Rane, we notice they are made from multi-colored suede patches. The Texans step aside as the Mexican pulls a gold butane lighter from his pocket. Igniting it, the Mexican runs the lighter up and down Charlie's cheek. Even though he is not tied or held down, Rane does not resist.

Rane is too keyed up to stop now: he plugs them both with the .45, first the American, then the whore. Rane steps back into the corridor next to Johnny.
