0) 142) dialog: Can you hear me, Charlie? This is very important. Can you tell us anything? Who were they? With great effort, Rane shakes his head "no" and sinks back to the pillow. The screen goes OUT OF FOCUS and slowly to BLACK.

The AF chauffeur also gets out but Rane waves him back also. Charlie walks toward the front door. Maxwell and the chauffeur look at each other, shrug, and get back into the car. Once inside the INT. LIVING ROOM, Rane peeks through the front curtain to see 1f Maxwell has left yet. After a moment, the AF car drives away. Rane turns and walks directly through the living room. The room has been straightened and cleaned; there is a new carpet, but Rane doesn't even pause long enough to notice. Entering his CELLAR/WORKSHOP, Rane walks directly to his gun rack. He starts pulling guns out of the rack and placing them on a work table. - It is an impressive collection: 2 nickel-plated Coit Commander .45 automatics, a Smith and Wesson 357 Combat Magnum, a snub-nosed Colt Cobra .22 revolver, a Wincheste 12 gauge Super 6~shot pump shotgun, 2 Browning B-SS 12 gauge Double Barrel shotguns, plus clips and boxes and boxes of ammunition. With his good hand, Rane clamps the Winchester 6-shot into his workbench vice and proceeds to saw off the barrel. The barrel CLANGS to the cement floor. CU: lying on the floor, the sawed-off barrel looks like the leavings of a major amputation. Rane starts carrying his guns into the LIVING ROOM. TIMECUT: soon they are all spread on the sofa. Going into his BEDROOM, Charlie removes his suit coat and shirt. He removes his freshly pressed blue AF uniform out of the closet on a hanger and places it on the bed. Rane removes the medals from the uniform and places them on the bed beside it.
