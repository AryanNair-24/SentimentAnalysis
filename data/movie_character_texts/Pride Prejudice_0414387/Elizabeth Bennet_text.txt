1) 0) text: Elizabeth Bennet, 20, good humoured, attractive, clearly nobody's fool, walks through a field of tall meadow grass. She is reading a novel entitled 'First Impressions'. She approaches Longbourn, a fairly run down 17th Century house with a small moat around it. Elizabeth jumps up onto a wall and crosses the moat by walking a wooden plank duck board, a reckless trick learnt in early childhood. She walks passed the back of the house where, through an open window to the library, we see her mother and father, Mr and Mrs Bennet.
2) 0) text: As Elizabeth walks through the hallway, we hear the sound of piano scales plodding through the afternoon. She walks down the entrance hall past the room where Mary, 18, the bluestocking of the family, is practising, and finds Kitty, 16, the second youngest, and Lydia, 15, the precocious baby of the family, are listening at the door to the library.

3) 35) text: One of these days, Lizzie, someone will catch your eye and then you'll have to watch your tongue. ELIZABETH
3) 36) text: And eat my hat. She stops speaking. And stares. A dazzling group enters the room: George Bingley, 25, a good hearted soul but ГўВЂВў prone to bumbling embarrassment when his enthusias the better of him, his sister Caroline, 23, a victim of every latest fashion, counting herself superior to most company she encounters, and finally, Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy, 27, dashing, brooding with an introversion which could be misconstrued as hauteur. They are dressed in the highest fashion. Darcy surveys the hall. He catches Elizabeth's eye. She stares, with a kind of surprised shock. Jane notices and looks at Darcy. He turns away. JANE
3) 43) text: Elizabeth has found her great friend Charlotte Lucas - an intelligent, sensible woman in her late twenties. They spy through the crowd. ELIZABETH
3) 45) text: He is on the right, and on the left is his sister. ELIZABETH

3) 57) text: -- of Pemberley, in Derbyshire! A stiff bow from Darcy, Elizabeth smiles, Darcy does not. CUT TO:
3) 58) text: Moments later. Elizabeth is standing in a small group with Jane, Bingley, Miss Bingley and Darcy. Bingley can't keep his eyes off Jane, but is frightfully at a loss in disguising his instant ardour. ELIZABETH
3) 60) text: (smiling at Jane shyly) Very much. ELIZABETH
3) 71) text: Mr and Mrs Bennet stand a little apart from Elizabeth and the other young people. Lydia and Kitty bound up to them in a state of high excitement. LYDIA
3) 76) text: May I have the honour? They leave, to dance. ELIZABETH
3) 78) text: Not if I can help it. Elizabeth, Darcy and Miss Bingley stand in silence as they over hear the following... CUT TO: LYDIA
3) 87) text: 7 That dress becomes her, does it not. 7 ГўВЂВў Though of course my Jane needs little help from couturiers. Elizabeth wanders through the throng. She looks at Bingley and Jane ending the dance - she is coy and demure, he clearly smitten - CUT TO:
3) 94) text: Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld, but her sister Elizabeth is very agreeable. They have stopped at the edge of the dance floor and have not seen Elizabeth and charlotte who are standing close behind them. Elizabeth smirks as she overhears their conversation. DARCY
3) 95) text: Perfectly tolerable, I dare say, but not handsome enough to tempt me. Elizabeth's smile drops. DARCY (CONT'D)
3) 97) text: Elizabeth and Charlotte, who have overheard Darcy and Bingley's exchange. CHARLOTTE
3) 98) text: Ignore him, Lizzie, he is such a disagreeable man it would be a misfortune to be liked by him. ELIZABETH

3) 105) text: It is a pity she is not more handsome. ELIZABETH
3) 110) text: When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman so much in love with her that I was sure he would make her an offer. However, he did write her some very pretty verses. ELIZABETH (IMPATIENTLY)
3) 112) text: I thought that poetry was the food of love. ELIZABETH
3) 113) text: Of a fine, stout love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it is only a thin, slight sort of inclination, I'm convinced that one good sonnet will starve it away entirely. Darcy looks at Elizabeth with surprise. A glimmering of interest. DARCY
3) 114) text: So what do you recommend, to encourage affection? ELIZABETH
4) 0) text: Elizabeth and Jane are both tucked up in the same bed, but are too excited to sleep. JANE
4) 1) text: Mr Bingley is just what a young man ought to be. Sensible, good humoured - ELIZABETH
4) 3) text: You know perfectly well I do not believe marriage should be driven by thoughts of money. ELIZABETH
4) 5) text: Do you really believe he liked me, Lizzie? ELIZABETH
4) 7) text: I was flattered, I must admit. I did not expect such a compliment. ELIZABETH
4) 9) text: Lizzie! ELIZABETH
4) 12) text: Not his friend. I still cannot believe what he said about you. ELIZABETH
5) 3) text: Oh, Mr Bennet! Anybody would think the girls looked forward to a grand inheritance. Elizabeth rolls her eyes at Mr Bennet, they've heard this speech many times before. MR BENNET (NOT LISTENING)
5) 5) text: As you well know, Mr Bennet, when you die, which may in fact be very soon, our girls will be left without a roof over their head nor a penny to their name. ELIZABETH

14) 3) text: Don't worry. I don't know who is more pleased at your being here, Mama or Mr Bingley. Bingley comes in having attended to the doctor. ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
18) 0) text: Elizabeth is reading a book. Darcy is writing a letter. Bingley is sat nervously. Caroline, obviously bored, wanders the room looking for distraction. She looks over Darcy's shoulder. CAROLINE BINGLEY
18) 13) text: The word is indeed applied too liberally. I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen women, in all my acquaintance, that are truely accomplished. ГўВЂВў CAROLINE BINGLEY Nor I, to be sure! ELIZABETH
18) 17) text: And of course she must improve her mind by extensive reading. Elizabeth closes her book. ELIZABETH
18) 27) text: (to Lizzie, archly) What can he mean? ELIZABETH
18) 33) text: Oh no, Mr Darcy is not to be laughed at! ELIZABETH
18) 35) text: That I couldn't say. ELIZABETH
18) 37) text: Maybe it's that I find it hard to forgive the follies and vices of others, or their offences against myself. My good opinion, once lost, is lost forever. ELIZABETH
18) 39) text: A family trait I think. Elizabeth smiles, sweetly. Miss Bingley glances at Darcy.
21) 2) text: Are we to receive every Bennet in the country? Mrs Bennet, Lydia, Mary and Kitty are introduced to Caroline, Bingley and Darcy. Elizabeth holds her breath as her mother launches into untold gaucheries. MRS BENNET
21) 6) text: But I assure you there is quite as much going on in the country as there is in the town. ELIZABETH
21) 12) text: Oh do hold a ball. ELIZABETH
21) 17) text: Indeed much more rational but rather less like a ball. ELIZABETH
22) 2) text: Really, you're welcome anytime you feel the least bit poorly. ELIZABETH (TO CAROLINE)
22) 4) text: Not at all. The pleasure is all mine. Elizabeth looks at Darcy, who does not say anything. She gets in the carriage. ELIZABETH
22) 6) text: Miss Bennet. They share a look as Elizabeth joins the rest of the Bennets in the carriage. The driver takes off. Bingley waves enthusiastically to Jane. BINGLEY
24) 2) text: I can't believe it, there must be a thousand of them. Leading the one troupe of Militia is Wickham a very handsome blonde officer, Lydia spots him and swoons. ELIZABETH
28) 8) text: How happy for you, Mr Collins, to possess the talent for flattering with delicacy. Mr Collins nods with satisfaction. ELIZABETH
28) 9) text: Do these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are they the result of previous study? Jane kicks Elizabeth under the table. Elizabeth tries not to laugh at Mr Collins' answer. MR COLLINS
28) 10) text: They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with arranging such little elegant compliments, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible. ELIZABETH
29) 6) text: But Miss Elizabeth next to her in both age and beauty would make anyone an excellent partner. Do not you agree, Mr Collins? Mr Collins looks through the doorway at Elizabeth COLLINS

31) 0) text: ГўВЂВў Elizabeth and Jane arrive in the village. Jane, fo the dutiful daughter, looks uneasy- Elizabeth is flushed and reckless. She looks behind them-    
31) 2) text: We've lost him. They slow down to a walk. And then stop. outside the milliner's shop the incorrigible Lydia and Kitty are chatting to Wickham, the dashing young officer we spotted earlier. He is utterly gorgeous - slim, handsome, tousled hair. The perfect romantic hero. ELIZABETH
32) 0) text: They come into the shop. The others go towards the counter. Wickham hangs back, and smiles a complicit, witty smile at Elizabeth. She colours. WICKHAM
32) 1) text: Though I must warn you, I have very poor taste. ELIZABETH (SMILES)
32) 6) text: And deny people such pleasure? ELIZABETH
32) 8) text: Not particularly. ELIZABETH
32) 10) text: Especially if, like me, one has none. Elizabeth looks at him with interest. A beat. The moment is broken by Lydia coming up. LYDIA
32) 11) text: Lizzie, please lend me some money! ELIZABETH Г‚ВЂВў
32) 13) text: Allow me to oblige. ELIZABETH
32) 14) text: No! Please - Mr Wickham! - Wickham gives Elizabeth a smile and moves away to the counter.
33) 0) text: The girls emerge from the shop with Wickham. ELIZABETH
33) 2) text: I know. Fivepence halfpenny! ELIZABETH
33) 7) text: They laugh. Elizabeth is really rather taken with him. They walk down the street. ELIZABETH
33) 16) text: She is! Elizabeth pays no attention to the following conversation, instead she is looking at Darcy who, in turn, is staring at Wickham. They both obviously recognize each other and look very uncomfortable. KITTY
33) 22) text: Will you excuse me ladies? Mr Wickham. Enjoy the day. Elizabeth looks at Wickham, puzzled.
34) 0) text: A small cards party is underway. Three tables have been set up. Elizabeth, Wickham, Jane, Lydia, Kitty, Charlotte and Sir William and Lady Lucas are present. A small number of officers and other ladies are also present. We move around the tables. Kitty is sat with Sir William and Charlotte and Mary. Jane sits at a table with Mr Collins and Lady Lucas. Lizzie sits with Lydia and two other officers. Lydia flirts outrageously. Г‚ВЂВў
34) 4) text: So I believe. Mr Collins is at a table with Lady Lucas, he glances over at Elizabeth, as he talks. COLLINS
34) 5) text: - of course, when you understand that Lady Catherine de Bourgh is its proprietor you will realise what an immense compliment that is. Lady Catherine spent eight hundred pounds on a chimney-piece alone. ГўВЂВў Wickham who has been talking to some of the other officers comes and sits beside Elizabeth, passing by Mr collins on the way.    
34) 7) text: (aside to Elizabeth) Your cousin is blessed with an uncommon capacity for charm. Elizabeth laughs and plays a hand. LYDIA
34) 9) text: I hope to. (TO ELIZABETH)
34) 10) text: How long has Mr Darcy been a guest a Netherfield? Elizabeth pounces on this reference to Mr Darcy and takes her chance. ELIZABETH
34) 12) text: Indeed, my fate has been very intimate with that gentleman. I have been connected with his family since infancy. Elizabeth is genuinely surprised, there is a pause while she is forced to play her hand. WICKHAM (CONT'D)
34) 13) text: You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, especially given the cold manner of our intimacy this afternoon. Are you well acquainted with that gentleman? ELIZABETH
34) 15) text: I cannot pretend to be sorry. Elizabeth blushes. WICKHAM
34) 17) text: Miss Elizabeth, I was just saying to Sir William what appalling weather we've been having.    
34) 21) text: At the moment she has more suitors than sense. Charlotte looks over at Mr Collins. Elizabeth passes Sir William's side of the table. SIR WILLIAM
34) 22) text: Now any one for a round of bridge? Elizabeth? ELIZABETH Г‚ВЂВў
34) 23) text: Really I need to take some air. Mr Collins makes his way to join Elizabeth. SIR WILLIAM
34) 28) text: Collins resigns himself to his fate. Elizabeth smiles and slips out into the night air.
35) 0) text: Elizabeth breathes in the cold night air. She senses someone join her. She looks round to see Wickham has followed her as she had hoped.    
35) 3) text: Oh no - it is not for me to be driven away. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go not I. Pause. ELIZABETH
35) 6) text: He ruined me. She stares at him. ELIZABETH
35) 16) text: Breathe in! We move to the quieter preparations of Jane and Elizabeth. This conversation has been going on for some time. JANE (HORRIFIED)
35) 19) text: 0 How could Mr Darcy do such a thing? I will discover the truth from Mr Bingley at the ball this evening. ELIZABETH
35) 21) text: Poor, unfortunate Mr Wickham. ELIZABETH
35) 23) text: And lets hope for you a rather more willing dancer. Jane leaves Elizabeth, at the mirror, taking very particular care of her makeup. she smil6s to herself.
36) 4) text: How are you, Miss Elizabeth? Elizabeth is not paying attention, instead she is searching over Mr Bingleys' shoulder for a sight of Wickham. BINGLEY
36) 5) text: Are you, looking for someone? ELIZABETH
36) 7) text: It is lovely, Mr Bingley. Bingley and Jane move off leaving Elizabeth with Mrs Bennet and others. While Mrs Bennet talks we focus on Elizabeth searching the sea of red coats. MRS BENNET
36) 9) text: I dare say I have never met a more pleasant gentleman in all my years. Look how he dotes on her! Still Jane has always done what is best for her family. Elizabeth takes this opportunity to slip away into the next room. Elizabeth looks around but cannot see Mr Wickham. Suddenly she thinks she sees him, so starts to a r, move over. The man turns round, it is not Wickham bu someone else. Elizabeth walks nonchanantly into the next room, again looking for Mr Wickham. She cranes around trying to see ГўВЂВў him then she is suddenly surprised by Charlotte Lu    
36) 12) text: Perhaps he is in the ballroom. They both walk into the ball room. We pull back to reveal a sea of dancers. Wickham is nowhere to be seen. Jane appears and catches Elizabeths arm. JANE
36) 13) text: He's not here. Apparently otherwise detained. The disappointment is palpable on Elizabeth's face. ELIZABETH
36) 14) text: Detained? Mr Collins arrives, breathless. He smiles eagerly at Elizabeth. COLLINS
36) 15) text: There you are. Г‚ВЂВў ELIZABETH
36) 17) text: Perhaps you will do me the honour, Miss Elizabeth? ELIZABETH
36) 19) text: I do not consider it incompatible with the office of a clergyman to indulge in such an innocent diversion. Elizabeth tries to smile, politely.
36) 23) text: ГўВЂВў To be sure, dancing is of little consequence to me, but it does afford the opportunity to lavish'ones partner with delicate attentions which is my primary object of the evening. Elizabeth turns as part of the dance and for a moment she dances beside Jane. JANE
36) 24) text: Apparently Your Mr Wickham has been called on some business to town, though my informer told me he would have been less inclined to be engaged had it not been for the presence at Netherfield of a certain gentleman. Jane indicates towards where Darcy stands watching them. ELIZABETH
36) 25) text: That gentleman barely warrants the name. The dance leads Elizabeth back to Mr Collins.
36) 27) text: Couples are preparing for the next dance. Elizabeth and Charlotte are standing to one side when Mr Darcy approaches. DARCY
36) 28) text: May I have the next dance, Miss Elizabeth. Elizabeth is stunned. ELIZABETH
36) 29) text: You may. Darcy walks away. ELIZABETH
36) 34) text: Elizabeth dances face to face with Darcy. Neither can speak. They dance for a moment in silence. ELIZABETH
36) 36) text: Indeed. Most invigorating. They continue, for a moment, in silence. ELIZABETH
36) 38) text: I am perfectly happy to oblige, please advise me of what you would like most to ГўВЂВў hear. ELIZABETH
36) 40) text: Do you talk as a rule while dancing? ELIZABETH
36) 46) text: (deaf as a post) Sorry. The dance spins again and she is back with Darcy. ELIZABETH
36) 48) text: I will admit your Mr Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends - whether he is capable of retaining them is less certain. ELIZABETH
36) 50) text: I am. May I ask to what these questions tend. ELIZABETH
36) 52) text: And what have you discovered? ELIZABETH
36) 53) text: very little. The dancefinishes. ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
36) 57) text: Elizabeth is at the buffet watching Kitty quaff a huge glass of wine and having the glass immediately refilled. She is joined by Caroline Bingley who also looks at Kitty disapprovingly. CAROLINE BINGLEY
36) 58) text: Miss Elizabeth. Let me recommend you as a friend not to give too much confidence to all of the assertions your friend Mr Wickham might make. He is indeed a charming man, but one should never forget from where he is descended. ELIZABETH
36) 61) text: Is that Mr Darcy, of Pemberley in Derbyshire? ELIZABETH
36) 63) text: But I must make myself known to him immediately! ELIZABETH
36) 65) text: He is the nephew of my esteemed patroness, Lady Catherine. ELIZABETH (SURPRISED)
36) 66) text: He is? Mr Collins starts making his way determinedly towards Darcy. Г‚ВЂВў ELIZABETH
36) 69) text: Mr Darcy! The room around him stops. Darcy is surprised and turns round. In dumbshow we see Darcy is horrified by Collins' obsequiousness, during the conversation Collins points Elizabeth out to Darcy. CAROLINE BINGLEY
36) 70) text: What interesting relatives you have, Miss Bennet. Elizabeth walks away into another room. CUT TO:
36) 71) text: The other room, where Mary is singing badly at the piano. Elizabeth is horrified. She turns to leave only to see Mr Bennet looking on. He winces as Mary misses a high note. Mary finishes the song with an off key flourish. Polite applause. Mary smiles and prepares for another song. ELIZABETH
36) 77) text: Later. Charlotte and Lizzie are sat together. ELIZABETH
36) 83) text: But does she like him? There are few of us who are secure enough to be really in love without proper encouragement. Bingley likes her enormously but might not do more if she does not help him on. ELIZABETH
36) 85) text: We are all fools in love. He does not know her character as we do. She should move fast. Snap him up. There is plenty of time for us to get to know them after we're married - Elizabeth looks over the dancefloor to see Lydia dancing with a soldier. she's a little drunk, and very flirtatious. He says something; she shrieks with laughter. CUT TO;
37) 0) text: Day light creeps through the curtains. Mrs Bennet is sprawled on a sofa. Lydia completely drunk. Kitty asleep. Jane sitting demurely. Collins looking longingly at Elizabeth. Mrs Bennet is holding court, whilst the footmen behind are literally ready to drop. Bingley is standing, the perfect host, but obviously willing the ГўВЂВў Bennets to leave.    
37) 2) text: I have never had such a good time in my life. Mr Bingley you must have such a ball once a month at least. Caroline who is standing with her brother, yawns ostentatiously. ELIZABETH
37) 6) text: Really. This is enough. Darcy looking down at Elizabeth from a staircase. He turns and walks away.
38) 3) text: Oh! Yes. Certainly - Lizzy would be very happy indeed. Please -- go ahead. No time like the present. Everyone. Out. Mr Collins would like a private audience with your sister. Everyone looks in amazement. ELIZABETH
38) 6) text: Now! Mrs Bennet makes sure everyone leaves, winks at Mr Collins then shuts the door before Elizabeth has time to do anything. Elizabeth looks at Mr Collins who looks at her in earnest. There is a horrible pause of intense embarrassment. MR COLLINS
38) 7) text: Dear Miss Elizabeth, you can hardly doubt the purpose of my discourse. My attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life. Elizabeth stares at him, astonished. MR COLLINS
38) 11) text: My object in coming to Longbourn was to choose such a one from amongst Mr Bennet's daughters, for as you know I am next in the entail of the estate and such an alliance will surely make amends for this. (drops to his knee) And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affections. ELIZABETH
38) 13) text: And that no reproach on the subject of fortune will cross my lips once we are ГўВЂВў married. ELIZABETH
38) 15) text: I must add, that Lady Catherine will thoroughly approve, when I speak to her of your modesty, economy and other amiable qualities. ELIZABETH
38) 18) text: I know ladies have their pretty little ways, and don't seek to seem too eager - ELIZABETH
38) 21) text: I 'flatter myself, cousin, that your refusal is merely a natural delicacy. Besides, you should take into account that despite your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made to you - ELIZABETH
38) 23) text: So I must conclude that you simply seek to increase my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females. ELIZABETH
38) 24) text: Sir! I am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man. Please understand me - I cannot accept you! Elizabeth storms out of the room and out of the house. Mrs Bennet crashes in through another door, hot on the tail of Elizabeth. Г‚ВЂВў MRS BENNET
38) 27) text: - we shall have this little hiccup dealt with immediately, Mr Collins. Mrs Bennet goes chases after Elizabeth. Mr Collins watches through a window as Elizabeth is chased by her mother.
39) 6) text: Speak to Lizzy. They march to find Elizabeth.
40) 0) text: Mr Bennet and Mrs Bennet confront Elizabeth, who has been waiting in the hallway. Perhaps the other girls form an audience from the stairs, Mr Collins looks on sheepishly from the breakfast room. MRS BENNET
40) 17) text: Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr Collins, and I will never see you again if you do. MRS BENNET MR BENNET' ELIZABETH
40) 18) text: Thank you, papa. Elizabeth turns around and walks into the drawing room.
41) 0) text: Elizabeth enters the drawing room. In the drawing room, Mary is trying to read, through the family din. Jane sits very still. Her face is white. There's a letter in her hand. Mrs Bennet charges in, Lydia and Kitty in tow, and speaks to anyone who will listen. MRS BENNET
41) 1) text: Oh, ungrateful child! I shall never speak to her again! Not that I have much pleasure in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer... She jabbers on but her voice fades. We're with Jane, re- reading the letter. ELIZABETH
44) 0) text: Elizabeth and Jane in bed. ELIZABETH
44) 2) text: ГўВЂВў I have no reserves from you. Jane passes Elizabeth the letter. ELIZABETH
44) 4) text: Is that not clear enough? ELIZABETH
44) 6) text: But I know her to be incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone. ELIZABETH
45) 1) text: Give my love to my sister. And try not to be so much of a burden, dear. Jane's carriage moves away and the family wave. Mr Bennet talks to Elizabeth. MR BENNET
45) 2) text: Poor Jane. However, a girl likes to be crossed in love now and then. It gives her something to think of, and a sort of distinction among her companions. ELIZABETH (DRYLY)
45) 4) text: It's your turn now, Lizzie. Since you've turned down Mr Collins you're free to go off and be jilted yourself. What about Mr Wickham? He is a pleasant fellow and would do the job credibly. ELIZABETH
45) 6) text: Still, it's a comfort to know that whatever might befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will be sure to make the most of it. A small smile from Elizabeth.
46) 0) text: Elizabeth is making the bed and tidying Jane's belongings. There is a knock at the door and Charlotte enters. CHARLOTTE
46) 1) text: My dear Elizabeth, I've come here to tell you the news.

46) 6) text: You don't mind, do you? ELIZABETH
46) 8) text: He asked for my hand this morning .and I accepted him. Elizabeth looks quite faint. Charlotte sits on the bed. Elizabeth, after a pause, sits down beside her. CHARLOTTE
46) 9) text: I can see you're surprised - coming so soon after his wishing to marry you... ELIZABETH (WEAKLY)
46) 11) text: I'm not a romantic, you know. I ask only a comfortable home, and considering Mr Collin's character, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can hope for. ELIZABETH
46) 13) text: For women in our situation, what choice is there? ELIZABETH (PASSIONATELY)
46) 16) text: ГўВЂВў - to become an old maid, at best tolerated, at worst a burden, dependent on the kindness of others? Or to seek the protection of marriage. ELIZABETH
46) 18) text: Yes. An appalled silence. Elizabeth gazes at her closest friend. Charlotte has recovered herself. she now looks cool and composed - unnervingly so. ELIZABETH
47) 1) text: The militia are leaving Meryton. Hundreds of soldiers and officers in the red coats marching out of the village to the sound of pipes and drums. The villagers are out to bid them farewell. Lydia and Kitty run through the crowds very distraught. They find Elizabeth coming in the other direction. LYDIA
47) 2) text: It's too dreadful! They're leaving for Brighton. ELIZABETH
47) 5) text: Not a word of warning! Lydia wails. Elizabeth searches the red coats for Wickham. She spots him, he glances across at her, she gives a pathetic wave and he's gone. Lydia and Kitty chase the last of the officers, leaving Elizabeth alone. She walks into the post office. Г‚ВЂВў    
47) 8) text: Bad news, Miss? ELIZABETH

50) 9) text: Tell me, how are things concerning Mr Wickham? Elizabeth's face changes. ELIZABETH

Georgina stops playing and laughs uproariougly. She stands and kisses the figure, the sunlight hits his face. It is Darcy. Georgina and Darcy kiss. Elizabeth is stunned to see him there.

The footman opens the double doors to reveal the magnificent drawing room. Darcy is there. So is the dreaded Miss Bingley. Seeing her, Elizabeth's polite smile falters.

101) 11) text: And can you declare there is no foundation for it? ELIZABETH
101) 13) text: This is not to be borne. Has my nephew made you an offer of marriage? IS ELIZABETH
101) 15) text: Let me be understood. Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say? ELIZABETH
101) 17) text: Oh obstinate girl! This union has been planned since their infancy. Do you think it can be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to his family? Whose own sister's elopement resulted in the scandalously patched-up marriage, only achieved at the expense of your uncle? Heaven and earth, are the shades of Pemberly to be thus polluted? Now tell me once and for all, are you engaged to him? Г‚ВЂВў ELIZABETH
101) 20) text: And will you promise never to enter into such an engagement? ELIZABETH
101) 21) text: I will not. And I certainly never shall. Allow me to say, the arguments which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have, insulted me in every possible method and can now have nothing further to say. I must ask you to leave immediately. Good night. Elizabeth throws open.the door, revealing the family outside. LADY CATHERINE
101) 22) text: I have never been thus treated in my entire life. Lady Catherine storms past the family and out into the night. Elizabeth is standing shaking with the excitement of having stood so firmly up for herself. MR BENNET
101) 23) text: Lizzie, what on earth is going on? Г‚ВЂВў ELIZABETH
101) 25) text: Lizzie! ELIZABETH
101) 26) text: For once in your life. Just leave me alone. Everyone looks aghast at Elizabeth's reaction.
102) 0) text: Jane is fast asleep. Elizabeth unable to sleep. She quietly climbs out of bed and creeps out of the room.
103) 0) text: Elizabeth sits alone downstairs, thinking. Outside we see dawn is breaking.    
104) 0) text: Elizabeth creeps out into the garden and wanders around through the early morning mist, as the sun starts to rise.
105) 0) text: Elizabeth walks out into the open countryside. The mists are starting to evaporate. From out of the mist in the distance a figure emerges. Her heart misses a beat. She is alone, vulnerable. Then she sees it is Darcy. ELIZABETH
105) 2) text: What are you doing out here so early? ELIZABETH
105) 5) text: Elizabeth hardly knows how to react at this unexpected meeting. Rather politely she thanks Mr Darcy. ELIZABETH
105) 7) text: I am alarmed that you know of what I have been so in earnest to keep silent. But you must know that your happiness was one of my prime inducements. Elizabeth looks at Darcy.
105) 11) text: If, however, your feelings have changed... Elizabeth gazes at him. DARCY (CONT'D)
105) 12) text: I would have to tell you, you have bewitched me body and soul and I love and love and love you. And never wish to be parted from you from this day on. Elizabeth looks at him. She does not say a word. Darcy is staring at her for a reply. A tear rolls down Elizabeth's cheek. ELIZABETH
106) 0) text: The place is in an uproar. Bingley, Jane, Mary, Kitty, Mr and Mrs Bennet are all gathered, fretting terribly about Elizabeth's whereabouts. Through a window we see Elizabeth lead Darcy along the duck board plank across the moat. Elizabeth enters the house, everybody starts. MRS BENNET
106) 1) text: Lizzie, where have you been. We thought something had happened to you. Darcy follows Elizabeth in.
106) 5) text: Lizzie, are you out of your senses? I thought you hated the man. ELIZABETH
106) 7) text: He is rich, to be sure, and you will have more fine carriages than Jane. But will that make you happy? ELIZABETH (UNCOMFORTABLE)
106) 9) text: None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of fellow, but this would be nothing if you really liked him. ELIZABETH
107) 3) text: Good Lord. I must pay him back. ELIZABETH
107) 8) text: You do love him, don't you? Elizabeth nods. ELIZABETH
107) 10) text: I cannot believe that anyone can deserve you, but it seems I am over-ruled. So I heartily give my consent. Elizabeth jumps up and puts her arms around him. MR BENNET
107) 11) text: I could not have parted with you, my Lizzie, to any one less worthy. ELIZABETH
107) 15) text: Allow me, Mrs Darcy. He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley. ELIZABETH
107) 18) text: the look. It was too long ago and I was in the middle before I knew it had begun. ELIZABETH
107) 20) text: For the liveliness of your mind, I did. ELIZABETH
