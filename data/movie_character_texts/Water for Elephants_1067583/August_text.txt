Jacob is mesmerized by August. August stands and tap danc across the roofs. Jacob has no choice but to follow... The two men dance and leap atop the train from car to car across the moving train...Jacob grows increasingly confid and euphoric following August's exultant lead.

33) 1) dialog: I'm sure it's nothing serious. Don't tell my wife I said this but she coddles them too much. She has a particularly strong affection for Silver Star. I don't encourage it. It's unhealthy to love an animal that much...Here she is. Marlena runs up to them, still in her bed clothes/robe.

34) 1) dialog: Jesus, Marlena, he wasn't this bad in the show. Jacob moves to examine the horse, but he flinches in pain Marlena takes over, by sitting besides Silver Star's head and stroking his head while singing a soft lullaby. Jacob registers Marlena's soothing effect causes Silver S to relax...his breathing grows calmer. So Jacob begins to examine him as Marlena watches protectively. Jacob runs his right hand down the leg to the fetlock. He lays his hand on the hoof then place his thumb and forefi on the back of the fetlock. He looks at the sole of the h which is bulging and dark with a red line around the edge Jacob's expression tells us this is a bad sign.
34) 2) dialog: Is that the problem?
34) 5) dialog: Well, how are you going to fix it? Marlena looks at him coolly, expecting an explanation. Ja doesn't want to tell her the truth. Jacob looks to August and rises, leaving Marlena with the horse. Jacob pulls August away to whisper.

All are massi As soon as Jacob appears, they lift their heads ominously August has unlocked the dens but left the padlock hanging the cage bars. The animals can smell the buckets now. The growl. Jacob is a bit unhinged:
37) 2) dialog: Unless you think a formal sit-down is appropriate. Jacob approaches the tiger first. The six hundred pound c rises then roars, his massive head hitting the cage and rattling the lose padlock. Jacob freezes.
37) 3) dialog: Why don't you start with Rex... that's him on the left. August is pointing to one of the lions - with a ratty man and visible rib cage. Smaller than the tiger, Jacob has a more nerve. He reaches for a bucket...August suddenly sho unnerving Jacob even more:
37) 4) dialog: 
37) 12) dialog: What's the matter? Didn't they cover this in school? August is having a grand time. Jacob smirks. Rex is rubbi his mangy coat against the cage bars. Jacob fumbles, removing the padlock and laying it at his feet. He lifts the bucket and waits. When Rex turns away the cage door, Jacob swings it open. But before he can sp out the contents of the bucket: Rex turns and chomps his huge jaw down on Jacob's arm. JA SCREAMS. The bucket drops, spilling the entrails inside w cause Rex to release Jacob's arm and attack the food. Jacob slams the cage shut and checks to see if he has an He does but it is dripping with saliva and as red as if h dipped it in boiling water. But no skin is broken. August is hysterically laughing.

37) 28) dialog: We always have choices, Jacob - a choice between our pain and someone else's. That horse was performing before you came and he will continue to perform until he drops dead. I'm telling you to keep it alive and that's what you'll do or you'll be red lit like anyone else who doesn't obey the law here. Every nation has it's own laws under God, Jacob. You left America the second you jumped my train. I like you. Believe me, I do. I'm only thinking of your future. August lets go of his arm and walks away. Jacob is angry.
40) 12) dialog: You've got a gift for them. Like Marlena with horses. It's God- given. I can always spot it. Jacob takes Bobo out of his den. Bobo hugs him tightly. H continues on as he replies;
40) 14) dialog: He must have been a wise man.
40) 21) dialog: You're a genuine curiosity Jacob Jankowski. What am I to do with you? ... I threaten to throw you off a moving train, feed you to my lions and you go ahead and shoot my star horse anyway. So I think - Jacob's an educated man. For Jacob to disobey me and shoot that horse, that horse must have been in pretty bad shape. Perhaps bad enough to injure my Marlena during the show. And so I think Jacob Jankowski might be a valuable person to have around.
40) 23) dialog: You're not going anywhere. You belong here. These animals..they've been waiting for you. Jacob doesn't know whether to believe him or not. Then:
40) 24) dialog: But don't ever disobey me like that again. I'll give you this one. I'll call it "respect"...Next one I call "betrayal". Understood?
40) 32) dialog: The cats. You see, meat eaters are always more valuable to a circus than hay burners. And you saw what we had to feed them.
40) 34) dialog: We should have just enough food for them to get us to the next show, thanks to you. Of course Marlena won't speak to me for a day or two but she'll come around...So, I was right. You are a valuable man. As he walks away, rifle over his arm, Jacob is unnerved;

47) 40) dialog: All right, let me ask you - do you honestly think this is the most spectacular show on earth?
47) 42) dialog: No. It's nowhere near. Lucinda, our Fat Lady, isn't 800 pounds. Four at the tops. And you really think the Tattooed Man got tattooed by headhunters in Borneo? He's from Pittsburgh. Took him nine years to ink himself. And you know what I did when the hippo died? Swapped out her water for formaldehyde and kept showing her. For two weeks, we travelled with a pickled hippo..
47) 49) dialog: (Jacob &amp; Marlena laugh) ..The world is run on tricks - in here and out there. So trust me, it's having a talent that counts. In this world, it's all that's real.

Marlena smiles in agreement. August rises to toast. Jacob and Marlena follow.
