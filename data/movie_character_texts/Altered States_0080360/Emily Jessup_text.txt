The room doesn't have too much furniture -- an overstuffed chair on which Sylvia is heavily emplanted, and a sofa, at one end of which Jessup is seated. At the other end of the couch, the Sculptress is sort of making a play for the genet- icist's Wife. There 1s an open space on the couch next to Jessup for which Emily heads, not all that easy a journey since the rest of the people in the room are lounging about on Levantine cushions on the floor or perched on the enormous round coffee table in the middle. 20 10. Jessup seems a bit out of things, distracted by his own20 thoughts. A joint is being passed around. When it reaches Jessup, he declines to puff but passes it along to the biochemist sitting on a wooden folding chair at his elbow. She waits Emily slides into the open seat beside him.

She subsides back onto the sofa, opens her eyes -- HER POV - Jessup's transfixed face. His eyes are wide open, rigidly staring into space, entranced.
11) 1) dialog: What are you thinking about? For a moment, he doesn't seem to hear her. Then, the entranced look dissipates --
11) 3) dialog: Well, just so long as it wasn't another woman. Nevertheless, it had been a curious moment and an odd thing to say. She tries to see his face in the dark- ness, finally slips off the sofa and joins him sitting on the floor leaning back against the sofa.

The Woman is twenty-eight years old, wears ordinary street clothes, a blouse and jeans, but is manifestly mad. She has that razor-sharp look, and she glgsles and shuffles as the Doctor moves her along. A stairway door opens, and Emily enters, pauses by the door to let the Patient and Doctor pass; they disapoear into a room down the hall. Emily heads for the door just before that one.

Through the window, we can see into a family- therapy room where the Patient we had seen in the hall- way a moment before is now being seated on a leather chair, the sort of chair which can unfold back into a reclining chair. Alan Hobart, in a long doctor’s coat, is being reassuring to the Patient. We can HEAR his friendly voice via a speaker on the wall.

You carry on like a flagellant, which can be very nice, but I sometimes wonder if it's me that's being made love to. I feel like I'm being harpooned by some raging priest in the act of receiving God. She would go on but is interrupted by VOICES issuing from the loudspeaker.
14) 16) dialog: -- You're -- a Faust freak, Eddie. You'd sell your soul to find the great truth. Well, human life doesn't have great truths. We're born screaming in doubt, and we spend our lives persuading ourselves we're actually alive. One of the ways we know we're alive is we love each other. Like I love you. I can't imagine living without you. So let's get married, and if it turns out to be a disaster, it'll be a disaster, and we'll shake hands and say good-bye.

I personally observed two instances of predation which involved the unmistakeable behavior of hunters. A pair of baboons killed young Thomson gazelles and ate them. There was a rudimentary communication between the two baboons that was noticeably different from the usual baboon vocalizations. So I've become fascinated with the work on non= verbal communication being done with apes. I've been corresponding with the Gardners at the University of Nevada.

He says that over the past year you've taken about two grams of that drug yourself and that you had a very unusual instance of genetic regression about three months ago, which he thinks was an incipient neoplastic process, and that you've probably got leukemia or lymphoma. He's been trying to get you into the hospital for a complete workup, but you refuse to go. He's worried stiff that you're cracking up. He thinks you're behaving very strangely, and he begged me to talk to you about this when I got back.

He's going over to M.I.T. to brainstorm with some physicists on Wednesday. I told him he ought to spend some time with the kids. He hasn't seen them in a year, they've been asking for him. This has got to be the most hideous weekend I ever lived. I'm still not unpacked. My husband has had a breakdown, and do you know the only thing I can think about right now is I've got to place the kids in a school tomorrow morning?

We are back to the reality of the observation room again, except that WAVES of different COLORS pulsate and throb across the SCREEN. Neither Rosenberg nor Parrish seem aware of this or of the SCREAM: but Emily is staring blindly ahead seeing and hearing it all. The SCREAM abruptly stops. Suddenly, over the speaker on the top shelf, we hear a rasping kind of GRUiiT and a series of CLICKING SOUNDS. Emily turns to the two men, her face drawn in panic and pleading --

The MASS of SUBSTANCE seems to be trying to assume a form. Stumps of arms and leas, misshapen and mis- placed, BULGE out of the mess and RECEDE back into it. The substance itself changes color, begins to BUBBLE and BOIL as if cooked by an interior fire. It begins to SCREAM a PIERCING and AGONZIED SCREAM. Emily's hysterical immobility is ended by this SCREAM. She splashes towards her husband. The room has become COSMIC BLACK, a BLACKNESS that PULSES with WAVES of force, SHUDDERING BANDS of RADIATION. The room DRONES with ENERGY. The space RESONATES and RIPPLES. Jessup's form, still recognizably human, seems to be caught in a PINCH of ENERGY WAVES and temperature differences, twisting and swirling around him, changing his coloration from LUMINOUS WHITE to FOGGY INFRA-RED to the BURNING RED of ultra- violet radiation to blurred CHIARCSCURO BLACKS and GRAYS of the quality of x-rays. 205 thru 210 211 107.

His bowels erupt into flames, rekindling the maniacal CARNAGE of COLORS, now so phenomenally hot he is BLINDING WHITE. He begins to SCREAM again in hideous terror, sinking to his knees as if he were melting, imploding as if he were being sucked into a black hole of his own, Emily flings herself upon this SHUDDERING, increas- ingly SHAPELESS anti-matter of her husband and embraces him. Not fifteen seconds have elapsed since the first explosion. In Emily's arms, Jessup's form THROBS and CRACKS and RESONATES, and he SCREAMS his anguished primal SHRIEK again. His eyes stare blindly out on some existential and unspeakable horror. Then, the fluctuating ex- tensions of matter that still retain the barely dis- tinguishable shape of arms flow out and unfold them- selves around his wife, and they kneel together on the flooded floor of the room, two terrified figures alone in the dense black spaceless DRONE of energy, elutching each other against the horror of human origins. Abruptly, the demented throbbing HUM of entropic forces stons. The COSMIC BLACK recedes as if it had been snatched up. Emily holds pressed against her the now entirely reconstituted naked form of her husband. They remain locked in their desperate embrace amid the wreckage of the tank room. Fragments of the wooden tank are everywhere, the smaller pieces floating listlessly in the several inches of water that covers the floor. Jessup is no longer screaming. There is NO SOUND at ali; the silence is palpable. Emily locks down at the ashen face resting on her breast; he is breathing but manifestly in coma. She turns her own harrowed face to where Rosenberg and Parrish are slowly lumbering to their feet, mutely asking them for help. Parrish sloshes over to her. He disengaszes Jessup's limp form from his wife's embrace and carries it to the door.

He finally embraced the Absolute, was finally ravished by Truth. And it fucking near destroyed him! (she's on her feet again, yielding to the hysteria) He never loved me!

116) 21) dialog: I'm not being facile! My God, do you think you're the only one who has experienced despair? The only one who has felt the utter nothingness of life?

It's the only act of faith most of us are capable of! At least, it's the only act of faith I'm capable of!

116) 27) dialog: (screams ) Defy it, Eddie! You made it real! You can make it unreal! If you love me, Eddie, defy it! He stands immobilized, crying helplessly. His body begins to RUMBLE, CRACK and buckle as if forces inside it were about to break through tne surface. He begins to rapidly change forms, some recognizable, some merely monstrous. He seems to have no more substance than a photograph, a projected illusion, a demented kaleidoscope of instant, transitory, transparent images, flackering madly in the wide shaft of sunlight. The hideous DRONE has become insufferably penetrating. She clutches her ears. She sees a quick fleeting image of her husband reaching out his arms to her for help, dut she is petrified, utterly immobilized. His arms turn into stumps. She finally forces out a hissing sibilant SOUND --
116) 28) dialog: (barely a whisper) If you.love me, Eddie! She is suddenly convulsed herself, clutching at her stomach as some great pain explodes with her. The blanket falls from her shoulders to the floor at her feet. Her arms begin to bulge and swell and discolor. A jagged crack appears on her forearm and shoots up the length of her arm as if it were splitting open. She slowly forces her arm up as if to show it to her husband. It is now a stump, and even that stump is losing its definition as the lines that define it be- come wave-like and seem to melt into the shrieking air. 230 thru 247 120. She feels a massive shock just inside her skull above 230 her eyes. A RED-HOT FLAME erupts from her bowels. thru She seems to be burning alive. Her EYES DISAPPEAR. 247 She would scream except her mouth has disappeared as well. The SCREEN has become total, impenecrable BLACKNESS. Then, out of the blackness, we HEAR a distant echo of a scream, lightyears away in the ultimate blackness. It grows louder. It is no longer a scream; it is now rather a roar of rage, the fury of a raging animal. Light begins to penetrate the total blackness. Forms begin to take shape. We begin to recognize Jessup's human form, flickering in and out of the madness of all his other shapes, reasserting itself. The blackness is all gone now. ‘We are back in the living room of Jessup's flat. He is standing, a completely human form again, naked, as immobile, enmarbled as a statue, stark white. He is staring at his wife, who is disintegrating into the shapeless anti-matter that had been his condition the night before. With a shocking wrench of effort, he takes a step toward her, forcing humanness into himself. One step, two -~ he reaches out to embrace the shapless- ness of his wife. It is instantly, abruptly over. The drone, the lunacy of illusion, the whole shattering moment is done. What we see, standing in the sunlight in the middle of their living room is a young married couple -- a slight, light-haired man of thirty-seven, beginning to bald just a bit but looking boyish at the moment in his Jeans and T-shirt; and a slim, gracefully naked young woman, her face pressed against her husband, her arms wrapped around his waist, a pair of young living humans, standing embraced in the white sunlight of their living room.
