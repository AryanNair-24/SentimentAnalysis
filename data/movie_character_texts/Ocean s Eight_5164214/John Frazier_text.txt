JOHN FRAZIER, late 40's, Men’s Warehouse suit from his ye trip to the Hackensack outlet, salt-of-the-earth, exits. inhales, looks around, heads in. INT. TIFFANY’S CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER The Tiffany’s Associate sits at the table, shaking, givin into the fact that even in his worst nightmares he could conjure up the circumstance which he is now experiencing.
120) 1) dialog: So you're certain the necklace in your possession is a paste? TIFFANY’S ASSOCIATE (shudders) Yes.
120) 2) dialog: And when did you last see what you believe to be the authentic item? 100. TIFFANY’S ASSOCIATE Last night, in Ms. Kluger’s suite.
120) 3) dialog: Now Larry -- may I call you Larry? TIFFANY’S ASSOCIATE Lawrence --
120) 4) dialog: My experience is, sooner or later people want to be rewarded for their patience. (takes out a toothpick, picks with vigilance) A necklace that’s been sitting ina vault for 30 years isn’t doing anyone any good. Nobody’s seen it, no one even knows what it is. But you place that necklace on a very well-known young lady, on an evening where said placement gets lots of play and attention and all of sudden everyone and their mother knows about that necklace. That necklace becomes very famous, very quickly -- right? TIFFANY’S ASSOCIATE Yes...
120) 5) dialog: And then if that necklace goes missing? John grabs every daily paper from his bag, throws them on table -- all the headlines are about the NECKLACE. JOHN FRAZIER (CONT’D) Well what else would people talk about? That’s a tale of scandal and intrigue that gets people talking and buying. (almost whispers) And what they don’t know is it is insured for $270 million -- so now you're up a quarter billion dollars, your name’s in everyone's mouth, and you’re missing a little necklace that no one had ever seen anyway. You get the publicity and the money. TIFFANY’S ASSOCIATE Are you accusing us -- 101.
120) 6) dialog: Merely floating a theory -- (smiles) That's my job. See if it were me, I'd do it early in the night. Get it off our hands quick. TIFFANY’S ASSOCIATE What are you suggesting?
120) 7) dialog: Speculating. That it wasn’t the real necklace to begin with. That someone swapped it out before it even went on Ms. Kluger’s neck -- TIFFANY’S ASSOCIATE I guarantee the necklace on Ms. Kluger’s neck when she left that hotel was the real one -- John Frazier shrugs.
120) 9) dialog: So tell me again how you remember it.
120) 12) dialog: Thank you, Ms. Kluger. Fortunately, I’ve been able to trace every step of your night as relying on your memory would be -- well -- less dependable considering your level of refreshment. (MORE )
120) 14) dialog: So as you can see in all of these photos, there is a young man standing next to you -- Mr. Klaus Von Gunther?
120) 16) dialog: (amazed) Is that his real name?
120) 18) dialog: German?
120) 20) dialog: Six o’ one. Was there ever a time when you two were alone while you were wearing the necklace? Daphne locks eyes with him --
120) 25) dialog: Do you suspect he would have any motivations to take the necklace?
120) 27) dialog: That's a sufficiently vague answer. (beat -- looks at the board) You know, I have every minute accounted for except five -- He looks down at a sheet of paper on the table -- JOHN FRAZIER (CONT’D) Well, four minutes, 48 seconds to be exact.
120) 29) dialog: They said you were charming. (beat) Funnily enough, the unaccounted for minutes do line up with when you were disposed by your sickness.
120) 31) dialog: Was there anyone in the bathroom with you at the time?
120) 33) dialog: How bout after --
120) 35) dialog: I mean in the bathroom.
120) 37) dialog: Sadly no. Legal thing. Whoever took this necklace is pretty smart and probably a woman. Or someone dressed as such. Or maybe this German fellow but that’s a bit of a reach. He lays out photos of Daphne with Rose, Tammy, and Debbie the background -- they are zoomed in or from the edges of photos of her -- the cobbling together took a long time. 104. JOHN FRAZIER (CONT’D) Do you know any of these women?
122) 29) dialog: Ex-cuse me... Klaus turns to see the middle aged man stumbling through sea grass. JOHN FRAZIER (CONT’D) Excuse me...
123) 1) dialog: Look. You’re gonna have to pronounce your name for me ‘cause...
123) 3) dialog: Thank you.
123) 5) dialog: Funny. You’re very funny. Really. Klaus glares. Get on with it. John Frazier opens a folder JOHN FRAZIER (CONT’D) So these are photographs of you with Ms. Kluger. As you can see there are many with your hand on the back of her neck.
123) 7) dialog: Ah, to be young. (smiles) Problem is, there’s a missing necklace and a fake in its place. And you’re the one closest to her with the greatest opportunity to...
123) 9) dialog: That's what I kept asking myself. When you were on the beach. I kept walking around here going, “why would this guy who has everything, wanna steal a necklace?”
123) 11) dialog: The door was open.
123) 13) dialog: (laughs) Gosh no. I work for an insurance company.
123) 16) dialog: Could you call me a taxi?
126) 3) dialog: Hello, Debbie. A long pause. She takes 113.
126) 5) dialog: That’s what you said in Philly.
126) 7) dialog: (offering) Pickle? one. Crunchy...
126) 9) dialog: Don’t know. Depends who’s got it.
126) 11) dialog: Well -- we’d need probable cause.
127) 3) dialog: Yeah, that works.
