The blood drains from his face as Zachry freezes for a moment, then turns and bolts. They howl as they rear their horses in chase. The underbrush tears at Zachry as he sprints back to his camp.

A few workers, and an army of conveyor belt robots wield scissors, sword-saws, and varying tools for stripping, rending and grinding.

They fall into each other’s arms, tears flooding down the faces, when they hear more horses. Zachry ducks and crawls to the window. Four more KONA are gathered around the empty horse. They begin calling a name. Whistling. Zachry looks at the dead man. Catkin sees him, too. Zachr hushes her back into her den. When he looks back out the window he sees the Kona coming towards the house. He looks for a place to hide; slithering into a cupboard as two of the Kona enter. Immediately they find the body. Zachry listens to their angry shouts; boots begin pounding through the house. The darkness of his cramped box is filled with the sound violence as the warriors tear through, smashing and destroying what little the Bailey’s owned.

The last one slings a rock and Meronym is knocked from he perch in a tree. She falls with a terrible thud, her thin silver weapon bouncing away. Zachry tries to get free but can’t. The Kona grabs the weapon before Meronym can recover. He lifts it, aiming it at her and pulls the trigger-- Exploding his own head because he had the futuristic gun backwards.

As their horses clear a ridge we see up ahead the brillia blue Pololu River, where the road pitches down and meets decaying bridge of worn planks and rusting steel. They race for it and as they do the sun clears a cloud ba and the colors of the bridge light up as if aflame in ora and bronze. The Abbess's final prophecy pulses in Zachry’s brain.
