Suddenly, Old Georgie LEAPS DOWN at Zachry who screams -- staggers, hiking up his pants and runs away, crashing thr the brush straight into a clearing-- Filled with savage-looking tattooed men astride armored horses: KONA RAIDERS. The blood drains from his face as Zachry freezes for a moment, then turns and bolts. They howl as they rear their horses in chase. The underbrush tears at Zachry as he sprints back to his camp. The taunting shrieks of the Kona and the thundering hooves of horses swirl around him, closing fast. Zachry can feel them almost on top of him when his foot g caught by a root and he suddenly drops, disappearing into thick bed of leaves. The horses scream past him. He lets out a breath, still shaking from the chase but as sounds of the raiders recede, he hears their SHOUTS rise renewed. He realizes he has led the Kona to Adam and his two sons.
