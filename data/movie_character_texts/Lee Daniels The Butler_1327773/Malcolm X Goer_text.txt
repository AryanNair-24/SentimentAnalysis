135) 8) dialog: Back during slavery, there were two kinds of negroes, there was the house negro and the field negro. The house negro lived better than the field negro. He ate better, he dressed better, and he lived right up next to his master. Louis stares at Malcolm X, taken by what he’s saying.
136) 1) dialog: Then you had the field negro who hated the master because they caught hell and felt the sting of the lash. Louis starts to nod.
137) 1) dialog: And today you still have house negroes and field negroes! The audience applauds as Louis nods in agreement. 75. MALCOLM X (CONT’D) The same old slave masters today have house negroes, who are nothing more than 20th century Uncle Tom’s keeping us passive in non-violence. That’s Uncle Tom making you non- violent, so you suffer peacefully. Louis’ face drops, he no longer likes this speech. MALCOLM X (CONT’D) Dr. King came to Selma with his message of non-violence and I think the white people of Selma would do well to listen to Dr. King, before the field negro comes along and does things another way. The crowd breaks out in applause, but Louis looks pissed. glances at Carol who has a grin on her face. Louis does n like what he sees.
