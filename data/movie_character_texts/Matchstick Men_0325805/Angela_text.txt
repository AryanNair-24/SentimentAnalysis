37) 17) dialog: Oh. (CONTINUED )
37) 21) dialog: First she told me you were dead. Then she said you might as well be.
37) 23) dialog: That's what the doctor said. On the phone. When he said that, Mom started to laugh. Roy glances about, anxious.
38) 0) text: Angela is served an enormous meal (turkey, mashed and gravy, chocolate shake), and Roy takes note from across the table.
38) 2) dialog: You're gonna get wet, might as well go swimming.
38) 4) dialog: (mouth full) Anorexia. (CONTINUED )
38) 8) dialog: I could have bulimia. That's when you go in the bathroom after and vomit. She continues to eat. Roy studies her face.
38) 9) dialog: You're staring.
38) 11) dialog: That's okay. I used to do it, too. Look at your picture and see if I got your nose or your eyes. Mom used to say I got lucky and only got your elbows.
38) 13) dialog: Fine. Roy waits: Is there more information forthcoming? Angela eats, deliberately: No, there isn't.
38) 15) dialog: Not now. It's summer.

38) 18) dialog: That why you ended up a criminal? (CONTINUED )
38) 22) dialog: It's okay, you know. Whatever you do. Everybody's done something bad in their life --

38) 26) dialog: (mock shock) What -- what was that word? ‘Shi...t'? (unfazed) When's the last time you saw each other, you and Mom?

40) 1) dialog: Got a pen? He does. She takes it, then his hand, and writes a telephone number on his palm.
40) 2) dialog: This is my private line. Mom got it for me for my birthday. ‘Cause my friend Carrie kept on calling after midnight. Maybe we could go bowling some time. Roy is caught off-guard by the suggestion. Angela leaps out, then leans back in.
40) 3) dialog: Nice meeting you, Dad. She closes the door. Roy watches her skate away, then glances at the number written on his palm. It absolutely bewilders him.
49) 3) dialog: Remember me? Roy nods, bemused.
49) 5) dialog: Took the bus. Think I could come in a sec? Panic flickers across Roy's face. No one but Frank has crossed this threshold in many years. He opens the door wider and she steps inside. She peers about.
49) 6) dialog: Nice.
49) 8) dialog: It's nice. Your place. I bet you're wondering how I got your address. He wasn't.
49) 9) dialog: Off your car insurance, in your glove compartment. Roy feels suddenly uncomfortable in his own home. (CONTINUED )

49) 16) dialog: Normally I go to Carrie's. Only her family's on vacation. And I thought, since we seemed to hit it off so good last time -- (hoping Roy will complete the thought; he doesn't) -- I could sleep on the couch?
49) 18) dialog: I could pay you back by cleaning up or something -- (as she gazes around spotless room; then re: his glasses) You wear those to read? They make you look kinda old.
49) 20) dialog: This late?
49) 22) dialog: Sure. I can watch TV. (CONTINUED )

58) 8) dialog: Why'd Mom leave you?
58) 10) dialog: I did. She didn't want to talk about it. Called you names. That's why we got into a fight. Roy smiles. Touched she stuck up for him.
58) 11) dialog: She said you were a bad guy. You don't seem like a bad guy.
58) 13) dialog: I don't think you're a bad guy. Roy smiles, shuts the light off. Immediately: KNOCK- KNOCK.

62) 7) dialog: What's his name?
62) 9) dialog: How come you didn't want him to see me?
62) 11) dialog: All you've got here is tuna. Lots and lots of tuna. And one TV dinner. TV dinners are cool. You should get the TV to go with ‘em. Roy stiffens, pissed: someone went snooping.
63) 0) text: Angela's on the phone:
63) 1) dialog: Hi... No... No... Guess... (beat) What if I am? So? He's my father... (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
63) 4) dialog: I know. I know. Okay, I promise. Yes, I promise! ‘Bye. She hangs up abruptly.
63) 6) dialog: At me. Not you. Roy looks relieved.
63) 7) dialog: She said she was gonna call the police -- So much for relief.
63) 8) dialog: -- but now she just wants me home in time for summer school.
63) 10) dialog: Monday.

66) 2) dialog: What's the matter? You freaking out about something?
67) 0) text: Squash, broccoli, artichokes, cauliflower, etc. Standing behind a cart, Roy stares at them blankly. In the frozen food aisle, Roy reads directions on a package of frozen spinach. Angela appears behind him, carrying chips, cookies, and a six-pack of beer.
67) 2) dialog: Don't you drink?
67) 4) dialog: Come on. I'm fourteen. Roy isn't sure which way to take that. 85 86 87 88 89 90 50.
67) 6) dialog: The line for that one's shorter.
68) 0) text: Roy cooks. His first attempt in years. He serves. Limp spinach and sauceless spaghetti. Seated at his breakfast table, neither he nor Angela look too ecstatic about digging in. He surrenders. A pizza delivery box takes center stage on the breakfast table; the spinach and pasta lie untouched in the kitchen sink. Angela bites into a slice as Roy forks a fresh can of tuna.

79) 4) dialog: I went to the arcade. It's only like a half-mile away. (CONTINUED )
79) 7) dialog: It's stuffy in here. This whole house smells like Lysol.
79) 9) dialog: I told you, the arcade --
79) 11) dialog: That's how I left. I don't have keys to lock the door.
79) 13) dialog: Jeez, you're worse than Mom.
79) 15) dialog: What did I do wrong?
79) 17) dialog: I just went out. I didn't drink, I didn't get high, and I didn't take any money out of your stupid horse. (as Roy goes white) So, what, you never heard of a bank? 98 99 57.
81) 0) text: Angela stalks away from Roy's house, book bag and skateboard in hand. Roy emerges far behind her and runs to catch her. She, meanwhile, mounts her board.

81) 4) dialog: Fooled me.
81) 6) dialog: Let me go. (as he does) You just don't want me going home to Mom saying she was right all along. You're like one of her boyfriends: I'm just something you have to deal with in order to screw her.
81) 8) dialog: (much too loudly) Even they tell me what they do for a living. Oh, yeah, antique dealers always keep large stacks of cash in their homes. Right next to their guns... (CONTINUED )
81) 14) dialog: Why do you have a gun?
81) 16) dialog: In case what? Roy is stuck. He sighs, resigned.
82) 0) text: Angela and Roy face off over another pizza.

82) 21) dialog: Really, you think that?
82) 23) dialog: That I'm beautiful?
82) 27) dialog: Then why won't you?! (mockingly) Because crime doesn't pay?
82) 29) dialog: You seem to be doing okay by it. Roy stops.
82) 31) dialog: (calling his bluff) Then why do you keep doing it? Roy has no answer.
83) 0) text: As Roy brushes his teeth, Angela sits atop the toilet.
83) 1) dialog: I'm not as innocent as you think. I've done stuff with boys. I've done stuff, if I told you, you'd probably throw up right here.

88) 8) dialog: Sure you don't need it? You've got a lot.
88) 10) dialog: Any of ‘em cute? The Housewife smiles, and Angela smiles back: she has her mark. She sets her bag down, stealthily planting the lottery ticket beneath it.
88) 13) dialog: That's what I keep telling my brothers.
88) 15) dialog: Central. full, Angela picks up her backpack to go.
88) 16) dialog: I'm gonna get a Coke across the street. Do you want anything? (CONTINUED )

88) 35) dialog: Thirty? You're sure? (as Housewife nods) Missed by one.

Meanwhile, Roy cleans his ball meticulously with his handkerchief -- even the finger holes. It's his turn to bowl now and, with a swallow for courage, he plunges his fingers into the ball to pick it up. Angela passes him on the way back to her seat.
100) 1) dialog: I own you. Roy glares at her, then steps up to the alley. Concentrates. Approaches and releases his first roll. Gutter ball. Keeping his chin high, he retreats to the ball return.
100) 2) dialog: (approaching him gently) Dad. The first thing you have to understand about this game is: ninety-percent of it is knocking down at least one pin. He grabs at her, and she screams with laughter. And just then -- BEEP BEEP BEEP -- it's Roy's PAGER going off. He checks it, sighs.
100) 3) dialog: You want me to bowl for you?

107) 7) dialog: Why aren't you -- why don't you go live in Hawaii? Why don't you buy Hawaii?
108) 2) dialog: Old and rich. Roy checks his watch. He's really not certain about this. 77. 126 127 (CONTINUED )
108) 7) dialog: Stop worrying about me. I'm barely even doing anything. He gives the whole plan one more thought. Shakes his head. She looks at him with puppy eyes.

109) 23) dialog: Oh, come on! I'm twenty-one! Roy peers up and Frank and Frechette turn to look: Angela is screaming at the lounge bartender.

109) 25) dialog: You touch me, I'll break every glass in this place. -- then hurls the GLASS down at the floor, SHATTERING it, drawing every eye, including Frechette's, and that's when Roy pulls the switch: the briefcase stowed beneath the banquette for the identical one by his feet. Lightning fast. (CONTINUED )
109) 28) dialog: Hey, you! Airport bartender! Angela backs out of the lounge, arms raised, giving the finger with both hands to the bartender. And she's gone. Frechette turns back, none the wiser. Frank knows, of course -- Angela's tantrum was part of the act -- and he looks at Roy incredulously.

111) 5) dialog: The whole eighty? Roy nods. Angela bounces higher, singing:
111) 6) dialog: ‘My dad's a smooth operator! Smooth operator!’
112) 3) dialog: Dad, I thought about it: we should give the money back. I'd feel better. He looks at her, and she smiles: just joking. He's not in the mood.
112) 4) dialog: Do I get a cut?
112) 6) dialog: (oblivious to Frechette) Dad?! Roy races down levels of parking lot as Frechette chases on foot. With a fair lead, the Caprice comes to four gated exit lanes, two cars in the three of them, one car in the fourth. Roy chooses that one.
112) 7) dialog: (frightened now) Dad?
112) 14) dialog: Dad! Roy hits the gas, and the Caprice slaps the gate as it rises, but before they're clear, Frechette gets a clean look at Angela hovering below the seat.
112) 16) dialog: Are we okay? Roy looks down to her, balled up, shaking with fear. He has no one to blame for this but himself. 131 132 133 84.

120) 6) dialog: When do you think you'll be back?
120) 8) dialog: Maybe when you get back --
120) 10) dialog: Is it, did I -- Roy keeps staring straight ahead. Angela cries, elbows in her hands, arms clutching her gut.
120) 11) dialog: I'm sorry... I didn’t mean to... Roy, tortured, can't look at her. (CONTINUED )
120) 14) dialog: Can we at least talk on the phone? Roy says nothing. She weeps openly. Roy shrinks as he sees a woman dragging trash barrels to the curb. Mid- thirties, a faded beauty. HEATHER. He watches with curiosity.
120) 18) dialog: I got it for you at the airport. (beat) I paid for it. She starts out of the car, but Roy doesn't want to let her go angry.
