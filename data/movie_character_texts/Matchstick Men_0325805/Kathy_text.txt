96) 5) dialog: Hi, Roy. They shake. Two people meeting after seeing each other every day for months.
167) 0) text: Roy pulls his Caprice up the driveway and gets out. Groceries in hand, he heads to the front door, unlocks it, enters. Turning to look inside the house: THROUGH the front windows, for the first time open and unencumbered by shades: Roy walks into the living room. A new carpet replaces the old. He pays it no mind. He leafs through mail, calls out a name, then turns as -- -- Kathy enters from the kitchen, wiping her hands clean on a dishrag. She smiles and Roy smiles, too, explaining what he got at the market and opening his market bag wide for her to see. She rubs his head: nice job, then kisses him, and he kisses back -- -- and when they break, she whispers sweetly in his ear, and he smiles even more. He looks down to lay his palm gently on her belly. They go into dinner. FADE OUT.
