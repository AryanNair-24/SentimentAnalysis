73) 9) dialog: For some folks, money is a foreign film without subtitles. Anyway, to the business at hand.
73) 11) dialog: I have one rule, Chuck: simple is safe. I'm going to tell you as little as possible about me and what I do, but as much as I need to make you comfortable with what we're doing. (CONTINUED )
73) 17) dialog: Five thousand pounds sterling. One of the perks of working in the exchange program at a bank.
73) 19) dialog: No one's in particular. Justa little money unaccounted for, floating on top the books like a layer of cream.
73) 21) dialog: It's a little more complicated than that but again: simple is safe.
73) 23) dialog: As a bank employee any attempt I make to change currency is recorded and questioned. Bob has a record. You, on the other hand, no one bats an eye. (beat) Now I hope you have something for me. nods, removes an envelope from his jacket and reaches it under the table.
73) 25) dialog: Congratulations. At today's exchange rate, you just made two thousand --
73) 31) dialog: You have a daughter?
73) 33) dialog: I have a fourteen-year-old.
73) 35) dialog: «+. and everything smells like gum. (suddenly has a thousand questions to ask Frechette) How do you get ‘em out of the house? Mine just sits at home all day.
74) 6) dialog: How much could you get your hands on? Frechette smiles.

79) 0) text: As Roy opens the door: Angela is brushing off her jeans. The window is open.
79) 1) dialog: Where have you been?
79) 3) dialog: I've been waiting over an hour. Where did you go?
79) 8) dialog: Where the hell were you? I want to know right now or I'm calling your mother.
79) 10) dialog: Why'd you sneak back in?
79) 12) dialog: You didn't see my car? Roy squats to pluck up specks of dirt Angela tracked in.
79) 14) dialog: Listen, Angela: I'm glad we met, but I've got a business, a partner, and I've got things a certain way, and that's it. Sol think it would be better, for you most of all, if tomorrow morning I took you back home. Roy brushes the dirt into a trash can.
79) 16) dialog: You didn't do anything wrong.
80) 0) text: Roy slides the head off his ceramic horse, checks his -38, then starts pulling out wads of cash. As he counts it, FOOTSTEPS march down the hall, punctuated by the front DOOR SLAMMING. Roy looks up. Should he go after her? He turns back to his money: it looks all there.
81) 0) text: Angela stalks away from Roy's house, book bag and skateboard in hand. Roy emerges far behind her and runs to catch her. She, meanwhile, mounts her board.
81) 1) dialog: Angela! I wasn't kicking you out.
81) 3) dialog: It's not that I don't want you.
81) 5) dialog: Will you stop? He catches her.
81) 7) dialog: Angela...
81) 11) dialog: Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm just... not good at being a father, alright? You know? I barely get by as me. Roy takes his hand out of his coat pocket to wipe a tear off her cheek. She recoils.
81) 12) dialog: Will you come back home with me? We can get pizza again. She won't budge.
81) 13) dialog: You can stay the whole weekend if you want. She won't budge. Roy doesn't know what else to offer but:
81) 15) dialog: In case.

82) 12) dialog: I told you: watch your goddamn language.
82) 14) dialog: What?
82) 16) dialog: You're funny.
82) 18) dialog: I am not going to teach you anything.
82) 20) dialog: Because. You're a beautiful, bright, innocent girl, and I'm not going to screw that up like everything else.
82) 22) dialog: What?
82) 24) dialog: (deadpan) No. (CONTINUED )
82) 28) dialog: No. It does pay. Just not very well.
82) 30) dialog: I'm not. Believe me. It's not fun doing what I do. A lot of the time it's stealing from people who don't deserve it. Old people. Fat people. A lot of the time I feel sick about it.
83) 0) text: As Roy brushes his teeth, Angela sits atop the toilet.
83) 2) dialog: Then don't tell me.

83) 13) dialog: And then you're never gonna do it again. You're gonna forget it. Agreed? But she's already frolicking into the living room.

87) 0) text: Roy crumples up his lottery ticket, rolls it in his hand, scratches hard at it with his fingernail. Angela, sipping on a Big Gulp, takes it from him.
87) 2) dialog: Just the... right. (beat) Okay. Most important thing you have to understand about this game is: ninety percent of it is variable. No matter how good your plan is, you almost always get thrown a curveball. So you have to be flexible, prepared to roll with anything. The one thing you can control, though, is who your mark is. That's your ten percent.
88) 1) dialog: Never play someone who's not buying what you're selling. What you're selling is you. An elderly couple separates whites and colors.
88) 2) dialog: The older the better, but beware of couples. You don't want anyone whispering in your mark's ear but you. A boy in his teens returns her interest.
88) 3) dialog: And, for God's sake, make sure the person you're conning isn't conning you. Angela gives him a get-lost look, then turns to a middle- aged HOUSEWIFE loading three machines. Angela approaches. (CONTINUED )
88) 31) dialog: Sure. I think it's Metro... Roy hands her the section. The Housewife opens it, passes Angela the ticket. Roy rises to feed a dryer (whose clothes are inside is anybody's guess).
88) 41) dialog: (as he returns) Any luck?

92) 2) dialog: You did very good. She leaps in the air.
92) 4) dialog: One last thing...
92) 6) dialog: Go give her her money back.
92) 8) dialog: I told you I'd teach you acon, I didn't say I'd let you get away with it.
92) 10) dialog: (shakes his head) Now. (CONTINUED )
93) 1) dialog: I have one question for you. And I want you to think before answering. (as she nods okay) Did you feel better when you took her money, or when you gave it back? (before she answers) Think first. Angela thinks.
93) 3) dialog: I'm not your partner. I'm your father. Angela puts her feet up on the dash. Roy doesn't mind.
93) 4) dialog: It's strange. Two weeks ago this was ancient history. Now suddenly I have a daughter.
94) 1) dialog: And I'm not... scared shitless. That's good, isn't it?
94) 6) dialog: I -- I took Angela along over the weekend, selling a piece. Sometimes in my business you have to create a value in something which really isn't there. What some people call sales, other people call...
94) 8) dialog: I didn't know how Angela would go for that. But she took right to it. She even helped out, this fourteen-year-old girl, working these people with me.
94) 10) dialog: (moment of truth) I really liked it. It was the best time we've had together.
95) 0) text: Roy opens his refrigerator door. Inside are grease- stained pizza cartons and Chinese food cartons. He closes it, considers the room around him. It's cluttered with fashion magazines, empty soda cans, a real mess. And it's very quiet, for the first time in a while. And lonely. 116 117 118 MATCHSTICK MEN - Rev. 7/17/02 72.
96) 2) dialog: She went home to her mom's. Summer school.

97) 0) text: Roy walks through the terminal.
98) 0) text: Before noon, the place is mostly deserted. One or two layovers at the bar and a custodian vacuuming the floors. Roy and Frank case the place. Roy, a standard-sized black briefcase beside him, withdraws a cigarette; Frank bums one from him.
98) 2) dialog: As if someone would do that. When's his flight? (CONTINUED )
98) 7) dialog: You plant this before the meet. And keep the table free. I'm here, you sit him there, back to the bar. Otherwise we blow it off.
98) 9) dialog: Ernie.
98) 11) dialog: What do you expect for fifty bucks? Frank scans the place once more, a little nervous.
99) 0) text: Summer school lets out. Roy scours the young teens flooding from the school from his Caprice across the street. (CONTINUED )
99) 3) dialog: In the car. She gets in, looks at him, grins.
99) 4) dialog: What would you like to do today, little girl?
99) 8) dialog: You'll be back by dinner. What would you like to do? She grins even wider. Roy blanches dramatically: Uh-oh.
100) 0) text: Uh-oh was right. Angela lifts a bowling ball up to her eyes, then lets it rip down an alley -- CRASH! Meanwhile, Roy cleans his ball meticulously with his handkerchief -- even the finger holes. It's his turn to bowl now and, with a swallow for courage, he plunges his fingers into the ball to pick it up. Angela passes him on the way back to her seat.
100) 9) dialog: It's me, what is it? (beat) What?! I thought it wasn't ‘til Friday! (beat) Well, tell him -- Roy's face falls. Angela, bowling in the distance, rolls a strike and leaps in the air.
102) 0) text: Now Roy's stressed, too.
102) 1) dialog: There's no time. I gotta get the money, change, get Ernie... What time's his flight? Roy's face falls. Angela, bowling in the distance, rolls a strike and leaps in the air.
103) 0) text: Roy exits, in a rush, and Angela trudges out behind, pissed.
103) 1) dialog: I'm sorry. It just came up. I gotta take you home.
103) 5) dialog: I can't, uh, I just can't -- (looks at watch) I can't do this. There's no time. I can't even take you home.

105) 4) dialog: ‘Cause it's a secret.
105) 6) dialog: Can I add an access signature to my account. The Clerk nods, puts forth another form. Roy pushes it toward Angela.
105) 8) dialog: Do it. She does. Back to whispers:
105) 10) dialog: No. You don't have the pass code. (CONTINUED )
105) 14) dialog: When I'm dead.
105) 16) dialog: Don't weep for me too much. Now wait here. I mean it.
106) 0) text: Roy opens his deposit box. Inside are bound, neat stacks of hundred dollar bills and hundred-pound notes, piled atop a fist-high ream of bonds. He starts picking up stacks of cash and placing them in the black briefcase. He closes the case, feels its weight. Then, to the guard around the corner:
106) 1) dialog: Hey: you got today's Times?
107) 0) text: Roy exits with Angela.
107) 2) dialog: (re: briefcase) I told you.
107) 6) dialog: I've been doing this a long time.
107) 8) dialog: I told you: I don't like the outdoors.
108) 0) text: Roy puts on his Arden glasses.
108) 1) dialog: These still make me look old?
108) 5) dialog: You know what to do? (off her nod) You keep real far away from us. Anything seems off, you get outta there. You see me tug my tie like this, you get outta there. He gives her two hundreds from his wallet.
108) 6) dialog: Take this. Just in case.
108) 8) dialog: What?
109) 0) text: Roy enters, carrying the black briefcase, and immediately he spots a problem: Frank sits in the banquette seat Roy should have. Roy continues his approach, clasping his back now and wincing. Frank and Frechette greet him.
109) 2) dialog: My back. Strained it last night.
109) 4) dialog: (a joke) I was doing yoga. You mind if I sit there. The high back helps. (CONTINUED )
109) 7) dialog: How are both of you? Across the lounge, Angela peeks out from behind a partition to watch Roy, Frank and Chuck. A waitress delivers Roy a club soda and departs.
109) 9) dialog: I suppose ladies do. The Queen before Ben Franklin. Roy lifts his black briefcase onto an empty chair between them and cracks it open just enough for Frechette to see: a newspaper. Frechette pries underneath: wall-to-wall British pounds inside.
109) 11) dialog: It always does. Frechette reaches in to flip through a stack of bills: they're all real.
109) 13) dialog: As long as you don't mind. Roy closes the case and sets it down on the floor by his feet. Meanwhile, Frechette replaces it with a gym bag. As he unzips it, Roy steals a glance at the lounge entrance: Angela is entering.
109) 17) dialog: (to Frank) You count it? Frank nods. A pregnant pause. Then:
109) 18) dialog: It looks like we have a trade.
109) 21) dialog: Enjoy the Caymans. Don't get too much sun.
109) 30) dialog: You do. Just get up and take your new briefcase with you. When I leave, I'll take my new gym bag.
109) 33) dialog: Have a safe flight. -- and departs. Roy and Frank watch him go.
109) 35) dialog: Go with him.
109) 37) dialog: Walk him to the plane.
109) 42) dialog: Then walk him to the security check. Frank follows Roy's orders and chases after Frechette. Roy reaches under the banquette and grabs the briefcase there. A bag in one hand, the case in the other, he takes off in the opposite direction.
110) 0) text: Roy exits briskly, crossing to the parking garage.

112) 5) dialog: You can ask Frank for his. Roy stops behind a minivan pulling out of a spot, and he turns to see: -- the stairwell door fly open and Frechette appear, ina fury, suitcase open and empty, looking this way and that. He spots Roy instantly and starts toward him. Roy punches the gas, around the minivan and away.
112) 8) dialog: Roll up your window! Now! Get down on the floor! Angela does as she's told. His money ready, Roy waits for the car ahead of him to pass through, but the ATTENDANT seems to be taking forever to make change. Meanwhile, the other lanes are clearing up quickly. Roy considers backing up and choosing another exit, but the minivan he passed now hovers behind him. He's trapped. And Frechette appears in his sideview mirror, hustling toward him. At last, Roy pulls up to the parking Attendant, thrusts his money at her, then barks:
112) 9) dialog: Open the gate, please. (CONTINUED )
112) 13) dialog: No! Please open the gate. The gate comes up, but too late. Frechette is upon them, on Angela's side, yanking on the door, rabid.
112) 15) dialog: (slamming steering wheel) Dammit!
113) 0) text: The Dodgers are away, leaving acres of parking spots unused. Los Angeles looms in the distance. Frank paces beside his car and chain smokes as Roy's Caprice pulls up. Frank steps up to see Roy glowering at him.
113) 4) dialog: (to Angela) Stay in the car.
113) 6) dialog: Stay in the car! Roy gets out, slams the door, then reopens it, turns the RADIO ON to an EARSPLITTING VOLUME, slams the door again.
114) 0) text: Angela can't hear anything but MUSIC as Roy tears Frank a new one.
115) 1) dialog: I said 'walk him to the plane.' Did you walk him to the plane?
115) 6) dialog: Did you see him go through security?
115) 8) dialog: Did you wait 'til the plane left the gate?
115) 10) dialog: Frank, my daughter was there today! Frank looks away, chastened. Says something half under his breath.
115) 11) dialog: What?
115) 13) dialog: How?
115) 15) dialog: He won't. They never do.
115) 17) dialog: Then he'd have to explain what he was doing with eighty grand and a ticket to the Caymans. (beat) We're not on the books. We're safe. (CONTINUED )
115) 21) dialog: Angela's never been arrested --
115) 23) dialog: Turn it off. She does. Frank leers at Roy: ask her.
115) 24) dialog: Tell him, Angela, and let's get this over with. Tell him you're clean. (beat) You've never been arrested, have you? Angela looks from Roy to Frank to Roy again. Then blushes. And bites her lip.
116) 0) text: Roy hands Frank Frechette's bag of money, and Frank starts toward his car, and the younger man takes off. Roy leans against his hood as Angela remains in her seat.
116) 2) dialog: You're fourteen! When did you have time to get arrested?
116) 6) dialog: (disbelief) They called the cops on you for a pack of gum.
116) 8) dialog: Angela...
116) 10) dialog: How long ago?
116) 12) dialog: And they photographed you? They printed you? Angela nods and bows her head penitently. Roy, his hands slowly returning to his coat pockets, takes a stroll, super-pissed.

120) 0) text: Roy looks straight ahead, arctic. Angela tries to thaw him. (CONTINUED )
120) 5) dialog: I'm gonna be gone for the next couple months. Frank and I have some out-of-town work. She nods, hurt but trying to conceal it. Tears form regardless.
120) 7) dialog: I don't know.
120) 9) dialog: (killing hope) You're getting in the way. Okay? I thought maybe it could work out, but it can't. Frank and I are partners. He wants you gone, you're gone. Angela's lip trembles and tears faucet down her cheeks.
120) 15) dialog: You wanna know why your mom left me? She left me because of you. So you wouldn't grow up with me as your dad. (beat) I am a bad guy. Roy can't stand this anymore. He leans over her and opens the passenger door.
120) 16) dialog: C'mon. Your mom'll be waiting. Angela wipes tears away. Anger supplanting grief. She digs into her backpack, withdraws an object wrapped in an "LA AIRPORT GIFT SHOP" bag, sets it on the dash.
120) 17) dialog: What's that?
120) 19) dialog: Ange -- She spins on him, furious, tears streaming.
121) 0) text: Dark. Roy's on the couch, arm thrown over his eyes. Hair unkempt, unshaven, wearing clothes for the third day in a row, the room around him a pigsty. Roy has let the place and himself go. The PHONE RINGS. And RINGS. And RINGS. At last, Roy picks it up.

130) 2) dialog: Hi, I need a refill of this. I don't have a prescription, but --
130) 4) dialog: I know, but this is an emergency !--
130) 6) dialog: (turning) Ever been dragged onto the sidewalk and beaten till you piss blood? That decides it: nobody's screwing with Roy. The Pharmacist scans the horizon for security, doesn’t see anyone.
130) 7) dialog: Please. I need a refill.
130) 9) dialog: My shrink, my doctor, he gave me these. They're samples of -- I can't remember -- Prefex- something.

140) 3) dialog: Get a room. Ground floor if you have to go out the back. And wait there for me. (CONTINUED )
140) 8) dialog: Take her to her mother's. Then you drive south and never come back.
140) 10) dialog: (hesitates, then) Take him to a hospital. Frank realizes the risk Roy is running. Roy kneels beside Angela. He closes
140) 11) dialog: Angela. Angela? Frank's gonna get you out of here, and I will see you in a day or two. It's gonna be alright, okay?
140) 13) dialog: I know. Honey, listen to me. You didn't shoot him. I did. Understand? I shot him. Right, Frank?

He staggers around the trailer, to the roof's edge, and looks down. The parking structure overlooks a largely-deserted stretch of Los Angeles. Roy feels his bandage again. Starts to unwrap it.

162) 38) dialog: Sticker's seventy-five. But I can knock off twenty percent if you pay cash. Angela and her boyfriend mull it over, under their breath then agree: it's a sale. Angela dips into her purse... He smirks

167) 0) text: Roy pulls his Caprice up the driveway and gets out. Groceries in hand, he heads to the front door, unlocks it, enters. Turning to look inside the house: THROUGH the front windows, for the first time open and unencumbered by shades: Roy walks into the living room. A new carpet replaces the old. He pays it no mind. He leafs through mail, calls out a name, then turns as -- -- Kathy enters from the kitchen, wiping her hands clean on a dishrag. She smiles and Roy smiles, too, explaining what he got at the market and opening his market bag wide for her to see. She rubs his head: nice job, then kisses him, and he kisses back -- -- and when they break, she whispers sweetly in his ear, and he smiles even more. He looks down to lay his palm gently on her belly. They go into dinner. FADE OUT.
