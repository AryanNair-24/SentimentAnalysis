24) 12) dialog: I really wanted to exit on a better insult than that, but my hamster brain wasn't giving me shit. Tomorrow in the shower I'll come up with like 50 zingers. I always do my best thinking in the shower. For instance this morning it occurred to me that if my hair is bigger, it'll create the illusion that my head is actually bigger. Who knows, Maybe even normal-sized. Just then, somebody slams into Nadine from behind. Her CHEMISTY BOOK goes flying.

29) 5) dialog: What? That's the worst analogy I've ever heard. First of all, my brother isn't a scrumptious chocolate snack, and second, how can peanut butter cups make you uncomfortable? (CONTINUED )
29) 9) dialog: That's crazy! They're not even that fatty! Whatever, you know what, fine. I would, I would never touch another goddamn peanut butter cup as long as I live just for you.

29) 11) dialog: I'd kill that sea life in the name of our friendship! I'd murder fish to make you happy! Krista rubs her temples, sighs.
29) 13) dialog: Are you fucking kidding me?
29) 15) dialog: No way in hell, Krista! I'd rather eat alone! I'd rather sit here all alone under this tree, just me and the penis and this can of disinfectant!
